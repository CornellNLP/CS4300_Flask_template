 [Silenced gunshots] 
 [Silenced gunshot] 
 Ah. 
 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
 Yeah! Whoo! 
 [All cheering] 
 Oh, nice move. 
 Oh, you're too fast, Annie. 
 [Laughs] 
 Sometimes I think you're letting me get through. 
 This week my team's buying the beers, so you have to come. 
 You certainly take the direct approach. 
 Ah, well, sometimes in soccer, you have to score goals. 
 You know who said that? 
 Thierry Henry. 
 Ay, you've just become the ultimate woman. 
 Maybe we skip the drinks, huh? 
 [Laughs] 
 You know, I'd forgotten how forward latin men can be. 
 No, Annie, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Give me a reason to stay. 
 Uh... 
 I'll do anything you ask me. 
 Of course I do. You work for the Smithsonian. 
 You play midfield like Juan Arango. 
 And now-now you're bilingual very impressive. 
 Do you know enough to trust me? 
 Is there a reason not to? 
 I need you to do me a favor. 
 I told you... 
 Anything you ask me. [chuckles] 
 I need you to help me get to your sister Julia. 
 My sister? 
 What-what do you know about Julia? 
 Actually quite a lot. 
 She raised you like a mother, pays your tuition. 
 She still lives in the house where you grew up in La Dorati. 
 Uh, it's a favela-a slum. 
 Which is why she homeschooled you and wants you to be a doctor. 
 Pediatric surgeon. 
 She lights a candle every Sunday at mass to be sure you do. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 How-how do you know this? 
 I have friends in Caracas. 
 [Laughs] 
 Who? Is this a joke? 
 My friends also tell me she's the manager at Banco Nacional. 
 In fact, she's the personal banker of Victor Ponces. 
 Oh, she handles the accounts of many government officials. 
 She's also his mistress. 
 Who, uh, gives you this kind of information? 
 For the past three years, Julia's helped Ponces skim over a hundred million dollars to profits owed U.S. oil companies producing venezuelan oil. 
 They transfer the money from a secure terminal in her bank to a secret offshore account in the Caymans. 
 There isn't a government official in Caracas who doesn't line his pockets. 
 Not that much, Diego. 
 These are large dollars that my friends believe are funding organizations that want to destabilize the region. 
 We need to look into that account and see exactly where the money's going. 
 And in order to do that, you need Julia. 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 And now I know who you are. 
 It was time, Diego. 
 You can still trust me. 
 And what if the money's going somewhere your friends don't like, huh? 
 That's above my pay grade. 
 But I am authorized to tell you that we'll protect both you and your sister. 
 We'll give you new lives here and pay for your education. 
 What if she doesn't want to do it? 
 [Chuckles] You don't know Julia. 
 That's why I'm talking to the brother she adores. 
 You do know her. 
 You can introduce us to her, help her understand that this is the right thing to do, the smart thing. 
 Look, I know this is... 
 [Scoffs] A lot to take in. 
 But if you help us, you will be protected. 
 If not, my guess is Julia's gonna get pulled into this whether she wants to or not, and you'll be on the first flight home, with a canceled student visa and no chance of getting back in. 
 I'm gonna need your answer by tonight, Diego. 
 And if it's yes, next time I'll buy the beers. 
 He sat there for 20 minutes after she left. 
 No phone calls, no texts. I would've heard. 
 Didn't say anything to anyone. 
 We think he's clean. Or very careful. 
 And that still doesn't explain what you were doing out in the field with Annie. 
 I ran into her at the game. 
 Suddenly you're a fan of intramural soccer? 
 Only on Sundays and just for the past few weeks. 
 How many times do we have to go through this, Auggie? 
 You are not sanctioned for field duty, not anymore. 
 I can't afford to lose you, okay? 
 I need you here. 
 Time to move on. 
 Annie. 
 Is your Smithsonian cover in place? 
 Uh, yeah. Got my I.D. yesterday. 
 Too bad about the photo. 
 Have travel book you and the brother to Caracas. 
 I'm sure you can come up with something museum-worthy to acquire there. 
 You're sending me? 
 Just to hold his hand on the plane. 
 Our station agent will meet you at the airport. 
 You'll make the introductions, and he'll take Diego from there. 
 The kid knows you. He trusts you. 
 That's what these past three weeks have been about. 
 He hasn't agreed to do it yet. 
 He's a 20-year-old kid with a crush. 
 He'll come around. 
 Jai, you're hovering. 
 The Caracas station agent. 
 Mm-hmm, Lopez have we heard from him? 
 Not yet. But the chief down there says he's been dropping out for two or three days while working this job. 
 So we have a day or two before we need to worry. 
 You might get a little rain this time of year. 
 If you're talking Caracas, I still haven't closed the deal. 
 Well, his hormones will close it for you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Why does everyone assume Diego has a crush on me? 
 Maybe it has to do with that little move he made towards your knee... smooth. 
 You didn't think Auggie was the only one covering you today, did you? 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Looks like it's your Smithsonian line. 
 Acquisitions, Annie Walker. 
 Hola, Diego. 
 Well, I'm really glad you called. 
 Yeah. 
 Jupiter, king of the planets. 
 Jupiter is the fifth planet from our sun. 
 Here you go, cuties. Eat up. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 "1,300 earths could fit inside. 
 What is it like on Jupiter?" 
 Chloe, that juice box is for your lunch bag, not your cereal. - Is this half-decaf? 
 First pot, nitro. 
 You want decaf? Find a barista on the way. 
 "Jupiter's atmosphere can crush..." 
 That was for the lunch bag. 
 Chloe, I'm serious. Do not poke that straw into that hole. 
 Hey! 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, there's eggs on the stove. 
 [Sighs] Girls, the bus leaves in ten minutes. Hurry up. 
 Not gonna join us for breakfast? 
 [Laughs] It's like a love twister in there, like being caught in a "momsoon." 
 Put down roots, you'll get through the weather. 
 Put down roots, you can't run from the storm. 
 Stop quoting mom. 
 Let him go, Annie. 
 You were always the one telling me to let go when we moved. 
 Well, if you want to survive as an army brat... 
 Well, take your own advice now. 
 You're right. It's stupid. It's time to move on. 
 Simobolivar and James Monroe.  partners in liberty... 
 And in boredom, I'm sure. 
 It's more interesting than you think. 
 I'm studying it for the museum. 
 More interesting than Cleveland anyway. 
 Why are they sending you? 
 We're thinking about doing something with the, um, rock and roll hall of fame. 
 And you'll be cage dancing in a bikini? 
 It's for the hotel pool. 
 Okay, first of all, get your hand off my ass. 
 I'm being your boyfriend. It's my cover. 
 Okay, be my boyfriend without your hand on my ass. 
 Thank you. 
 We're looking for a driver named Lopez. 
 He's wearing a gold 20 bolivar coin around his neck. 
 You know him? 
 No. 
 And, uh, how can you trust him? 
 He's a company man. 
 He'll be the one talking to Julia. 
 With your help. 
 [Laughs] 
 She'd like you better. 
 That's not an option. 
 Con permiso. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Wheels down? 
 Wheels down and looking for my ride. 
 I'm guessing he's gonna be pretty hard to find. 
 That's Maria who gave you the hip check and the phone. 
 And Rodriguez is the man by the door with the questionable taste in hats. 
 Got him. 
 He'll be keeping an eye on you if we decide to go ahead. 
 I If we decide to go ahead? 
 Lopez has been out of contact for 72 hours. 
 The station chief's worried. 
 What does that mean? 
 Well, it could mean several things. 
 He's sick. He's been compromised. 
 He's being followed. 
 Or he's dead. 
 It could mean he's dead. 
 Yeah, well, we're trying not to go there yet. 
 But the bottom line is you just might be doing this on your own. 
 He's been delayed? 
 Maybe indefinitely. 
 Our people are trying to decide what to do. 
 Options? 
 Cut our losses. 
 We bail and bring them home. 
 It's the Syrian arms thing all over again. 
 Ponces will have time to move his accounts, and we'll be back to square one. 
 Agreed. If Lopez has been compromised, we don't have much time. 
 Have one of the other station agents handle it. 
 Did Lopez read them in? 
 Just the bullet points. 
 Annie knows at least as much. 
 More. 
 She's fluent. She knows Caracas. 
 And she has a relationship with Diego. 
 But she's green. 
 It's her inexperience versus a closing window. 
 Might be a good idea to notify the D.N.I. 
 Bring the bureau into the loop. 
 Have they got justice to approve the tap on Diego's phone yet? 
 Not until we brief them on the mission. 
 They're looking for quid pro quo. 
 Well, they're not gonna get it. 
 Who else is at the airport? 
 Maria and Rodriguez. 
 Keep them close. Let's make this Annie's show. 
 And tap the kid's phone. 
 Will you settle down? 
 I think you're losing your watchdogs. 
 They'll keep up. 
 How long have you been doing this? 
 Long enough. 
 So not very long. 
 But long enough. 
 [Whistle blowing, car horns honking] 
 Don't overdo it. 
 And keep your hands where they belong. 
 [Taps on desk] 
 Diego? 
 Julia. 
 [Laughs] 
 This is the girl I was telling you about. Annie. 
 You're the, uh. The football player, the Smithsonian museum girl. 
 Yes. 
 I have some business here tomorrow, and I used my mileage to bring Diego along. 
 Ah, she wanted to meet you. 
 Business in Caracas? 
 Mm. I'm looking at a letter that James Monroe wrote to Simon Bolivar. 
 Well, you must need to freshen up. 
 Come. Let me show you. 
 So how old are you. 26, 27? 
 28. 
 Even worse. 
 How dare you date a 20-year-old boy. 
 Oh, I... he needs to study, to learn. 
 You American women are all cougars with hot tubs. 
 Julia, I'm not... he's there to get an education. 
 I understand. 
 A book education. 
 [Echoing] I'm not sleeping with your brother. 
 So then what? 
 You're not here to look at a letter to Bolivar. 
 Actually, I am. 
 But my real business here is with you. 
 You didn't know cougars like hot tubs? 
 Well, I guess I do now. 
 Still no sign of Lopez? 
 At this point, that might be a good thing. 
 We don't want to throw too many people at her. 
 Keep it calm and simple, Annie. 
 Don't give her any wiggle room. 
 She means wiggle-free. 
 "Wiggleless" Got it. 
 Was that you as a kid? 
 Ah, that was me. 
 Your sister looks like a popular girl. 
 Yeah. It takes her an hour to walk a couple of blocks. 
 Everyone wants to talk to la Madre de la Favela. 
 "The mother of the neighborhood." 
 She loves it here. 
 I couldn't wait to get out. 
 The other kids, they would tag all this hate graffiti about the U.S. 
 Me, I used to dream about it. 
 [Dog barking] 
 Everyone in the government takes a little cream. 
 Victor takes more than a little. 
 Our interest is in what he's doing with it. 
 He likes cars. 
 This goes way beyond cars. You know that. 
 What I know is that Victor is a good man, a loving man. 
 He's a criminal with many enemies. 
 I don't believe that. 
 And he's married with many mistresses. 
 We see what we want in the people we love. 
 Romance can be blinding. 
 You don't have to go down with him, Julia, but he will go down. 
 All you'll be doing is giving us a look at where his money's going. 
 You put an electronic tag on the account in the Caymans so we can get access to it. 
 It's a simple three-digit identifier that you type in after the account number. 
 He'll find out. 
 Eventually. 
 But by then, you'll be safely out of the country and resettled. 
 You say that so easily. 
 Leave Victor and my country, leave La Dorati. 
 You saw those kids. They need me here. 
 When I was growing up, we moved every three or four years. 
 It's what you do in the military. 
 It's hard at first. 
 But I learned to build a wall around those emotions. 
 How? 
 I took the pictures of all the friends that I had made, put them in a shoe box, and buried them in the backyard. 
 [Chuckles] My sister thought I was crazy. 
 But it was something I had to do to let go. 
 Staying wasn't an option. I had no choice. 
 And either do you. 
 So I put Victor in a shoe box? 
 There's no future with him. 
 Don't try to reason with love. 
 Then don't get burned by it. 
 Because it happened to you. 
 I see. And now you are a woman with walls. 
 [Children shouting in distance] 
 How long's it been? 
 About three hours. 
 It's the toughest thing we do... 
 Convincing people to let go of their lives... 
 Even when they don't have a choice. 
 They call you The Mother of the Favela. 
 They are all my children. 
 And Diego... 
 Isn't he as much a son as a brother? 
 You raised him, homeschooled him. 
 Doesn't he count? 
 Doing this guarantees his dream... 
 A medical degree from the U.S., citizenship for you both. 
 His dream is to come back, to practice here. 
 You sure about that? 
 Why don't you ask him? 
 This is the door to his future, to yours. 
 Walk through it. 
 You have to think of Victor and all this as your past. 
 No. 
 Julia. 
 No. I will not do this to prove Victor's guilt. 
 Then do it to prove his innocence. 
 Prove us wrong. 
 We will go away. 
 
 
 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Julia's in. 
 There's only one problem. 
 Ponces needs a password to access the Cayman account, and the password changes every minute for security. 
 So he carries a coded fob. 
 You know about the fob? 
 Yeah, yeah. They're. They're pretty common. 
 It's, uh-it's about the size of a jump drive with a small screen. 
 When the fob gets close to the bank terminal, the terminal sends the correct account password to the fob. 
 Ponces reads it. 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 Julia types it into the terminal, and they're in. 
 Bottom line-we need it. 
 And I'm betting he's never without it, probably showers with it. 
 This is one of those jobs where nothing's ever easy, isn't it? 
 Yeah, but look at the pension and the medical. 
 And the chance to spend tropical nights with 20-year-old men. 
 [Laughs] 
 He's sleeping on the couch. 
 The fob, please. 
 Uh, right. 
 We're switching his for Julia's after lunch tomorrow. 
 Julia has one too? 
 All the bank managers have them for their other restricted accounts. 
 They're coded differently, but they look the same. 
 Where are you gonna do it? 
 Julia and Victor have a standing lunch date at his beach club, followed by a siesta after in a private room. 
 Diego and I are invited along for the lunch part, and Julia will pull the switch after, when he's sleeping. 
 Diego... 
 Look at you now. 
 Ah, you leave here a boy, and you return a man, with a woman you don't deserve. Victor Ponces. 
 Annie Walker. Pleasure. 
 Julia tells me you're in Caracas to look at a Bolivar letter for the Smithsonian. 
 Actually, it's a letter James Monroe wrote to Simon Bolivar, thanking him for the statue of the harpy eagle he sent after the signing of the Monroe ctrine. 
 We have the statue at the Smithsonian, and we'd like to display the thank-you letter along with it. 
 Well, I would love it if you would do me the honor of accompanying you this afternoon. 
 Diego can drive Julia back in your rental car. 
 I would gladly skip a siesta to look at a letter from the last American president to care about anything south of his own border. 
 Is Rodriquez sure it's Lopez's necklace? 
 Well, they minted half a million of those coins. 
 There must be thousands like it. 
 He recognizes the chain. 
 From across the room? 
 Apparently from across the room. 
 Caracas P.D. found Lopez's body 20 minutes ago in several pieces. 
 We should call it. 
 If Lopez has been compromised, she's been compromised. 
 No, you can't make that jump. 
 Julia called Ponces last night? 
 Just to make the lunch date. 
 Analysts say it was clean. 
 No calls output from the kid either. 
 So we have no reason to believe he's made her. 
 Ponces has to be suspicious. 
 Why? She's 28 and looks like a cheerleader. 
 So you hear. 
 Point taken. 
 Annie doesn't look like a foreign op. 
 He'll test her. He'll try to draw her out. 
 But we've got people all around her. 
 There's no reason to call it off now. 
 They were both opposed to imperialism. 
 Great allies in the fight. 
 Not exactly. 
 Bolivar greatly admired Monroe for the doctrine. 
 But in later years, he considered the United States just as bad as Spain. 
 Yes. 
 What was his quote? 
 "The United States appear to be destined by providen to plague America with misery in the name of liberty." 
 Exactamente. 
 So nice to be with a yankee who can quote more than Lincoln. 
 Shall we? I want to leave time for the drive. 
 I should probably use the powder room first. 
 I'll join you. 
 Hmm. 
 He likes blonds. 
 Maybe you'll have an opportunity. 
 The ride back isn't about s*x, Julia. 
 The gold piece around your neck, is that a recent gift from Victor? 
 He gave it to me Sunday. 
 Pretty sure it belonged to a colleague of mine. 
 And what's that supposed to mean. 
 [chuckles] Victor stole it from him? 
 No. 
 I think it means he killed him. 
 Have you said anything to him that could compromise me? 
 I need you to tell me the truth. 
 No. Nothing. 
 I need you and Diego to go back to the bank and wait for me there. 
 What if Victor drives you back? 
 I'll make sure he doesn't. 
 Our flight's at 5:30. 
 Your flight, Annie. 
 In my heart, I know you're wrong. 
 But in your head, I think you know I'm right. 
 I can come by tonight. 
 The door will be open. 
 Annie. 
 Carroll Shelby used to do this to his passengers when he gave them a ride in his cobra. 
 If you can take those bills in the next ten seconds, they're yours. 
 [Engine revs, tires squeal] 
 [Intense music] 
 You must tell me, Annie, what does a worldly, educated woman like you see in someone like Diego? 
 You must have many men at your Beck and call. 
 I like how ambitious he is, that he wants to do something with his life. 
 [Engine whirs, tires squeal] 
 A doctor of some kind, isn't it? 
 Pediatric surgeon. 
 That's right. 
 It's admirable. 
 Still, young men... 
 Make such bad lovers. 
 I think you should be dating someone closer to your own age, maybe older. 
 Your turn. 
 My turn? 
 Mm. Hmm. To drive. 
 Oh... [both laugh] 
 I couldn't. I. I'd ruin it. 
 Somehow I doubt that. 
 Please. These roads were meant for this car. 
 Sure you want to do this? 
 Positive. 
 That way I can keep my eye on you instead of the road. [chuckles] 
 It's your car. 
 [Engine revving loudly, gears grinding] 
 Ooh. My bad. 
 [Tires screech] 
 Ah. 
 So, so sorry. 
 Third gear. 
 Faster. 
 Please. I-I can't. 
 I think you can, Annie. 
 I had my men search your car at lunch. 
 Strange how many of your answers seem to come straight from this book. 
 You even highlighted the Bolivar quote. 
 [Car horn honks] 
 Smithsonian employees have to bone up. 
 It's part of the job. 
 Particularly new employees, I'm sure. 
 This looks like it was made yesterday. 
 Faster-fourth gear now. [gears grind] 
 Please, I can't. 
 I just don't think you're trying. 
 [Gears grind] 
 Yes. 
 Damn. 
 You see, no one can do that without considerable training. 
 Now, please, get out of the car. 
 My associates will take you back into town. 
 They'll be right here. 
 Ow! Ooh! 
 [Grunts] 
 I think we better skip the whole museum thing. 
 I don't want to bleed on the Bolivar letter. 
 Yeah, we'll send your regrets. How bad is it? 
 It's a surface wound, but messy. 
 I'm ruining the inside of his car. 
 Sweet. 
 Where are Julia and Diego? 
 In the bank. 
 We have a guy outside. A cabbie with a beard. 
 He'll take you to the airport. 
 Does he have an extra dress? 
 Annie. I'm okay. 
 Let's do it. 
 Julia, we have to hurry. 
 What did you do to him? 
 It's not the time. 
 Is he alive? 
 Yes. 
 That's why we have to hurry. 
 There's a First Aid Kit around the corner. 
 Wait by the ladies' room. 
 Bring your purse. 
 We're not coming back. 
 "Entonces." Entonces. 
 [Tires screech] 
 All right, our cabbie reports that Elvis is in the building. 
 Damn. Give me the tag digits again. 
 9 bravo 7. 
 Nueve be siete. 
 We're in. We got it, Annie. We're in. 
 Thank you, Julia. 
 Victor's here, isn't he? 
 Please tell me there's a side way out of here. 
 It trigger's the alarm. 
 They're coming back for you, Annie. 
 Julia, we have to go. 
 Is it bad? 
 Is Victor what you say he is? 
 He shot me, Julia. 
 The red hits are the flagged accounts of known organizations. 
 That one's FARC . 
 This account's tied to the Hezbollah in Asuncion. 
 It's all actionable. 
 Puerta. 
 [Buzzer sounds] 
 He's coming back here. 
 You have to get out, Annie. 
 We have to go. 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 Por favor, mantengan la calma. 
 Calma, por favor. Your car. We leave it. [Tires squealing] What about Diego? We have a man out front. He'll get him. Get in! Get in! Julia, don't do this. No. He's your enemy. It. It's over. It's over, Julia. Annie, we just texted Diego. He's on his way to our guy out front. Thanks, Auggie. Don't want to leave the boyfriend behind. Confiscate their phones before they get on the plane. We need this intel analyzed before Ponces shuts it down. No one goes home tonight. Go, go, go. You gonna miss it? I'm sure there's a pickup game where we're going. I'll adjust. And Julia? It's been a tough couple of days. She doesn't let go easily. All roots, no walls. She loved it back there, Annie. And I keep asking myself if, uh... I did the right thing. They tell you where you're going yet? Mm. Only that we're going tomorrow. We should probably get back to the safe house, huh? [Sighs] Was that a sigh? It sounded like a sigh, like a troubled, guilty sigh. This is the business, Annie. It's what we do. Fact is, you should be feeling pretty good. Yeah, well, my shoulder's still sore. And my sister can't understand how a car accident would cause me to lose the $300 carry-on she gave me for my birthday. And I've got a 20-year-old Lothario bragging that he spent the night with me in Caracas. Oh, aside from that... Aside from that, I'm fine. And you shouldn't be here. Oh, Sunday's I'm drawn to the sound of a thundering herd. Sue me. Still, if Joan found out... She knows what it's like to Jones to fieldwork. I think she envies you. I bet she was pretty good. One of the best. I bet you were pretty good. Still am. And I envy you too. All that "time to move on" crap Joan preaches, I don't buy into it for a second. Every step forward begins with a firmly planted foot in the past. Auggie? Were you able to trace all of Victor's skim money? Mm. Mm. There were a couple of personal accounts in the Caymans we couldn't get into. Small change-we figure Victor was taking a cut for himself. And where does Diego's tuition money come from? From Julia's account in Venezuela. I can bring it up. What funds that account, anything besides her job? Money from one of the Cayman accounts... From Ponces. Can I get you guys anything? I'm not hungry. I'll be in the shower. So Ponces was giving her a cut? Yeah, she's using the funds to pay for neighborhood kids' education-ten in all. Also a food bank and a free clinic. They call her la madre de la favela. "The mother of the favela" Sweet. You going somewhere with this? Part of the reason she didn't want to leave is she didn't want to give it up. It's more than just loving Ponces. She doesn't want to stop funding the kids. And she hasn't. There were payments made out of her account as recent as yesterday. By her? Looks that way. How? She doesn't have access to a phone or a computer. But she could've borrowed one or stole one. She wouldn't try to contact Ponces, would she? The station in Caracas said he went underground. We're betting she already did. I'll be at the safe house. Let's get her backup. And alert the airports. [Cell phone beeps] [Clears throat] I'm going downstairs for some coffee. Would you like me to, uh, bring you back a latte? I'll come with you. No. No. It's in the building, Mr. Hughes. I'll be gone five minutes. She wasn't at the coffee shop. We ran a four. Block grid. Texts on my phone are deleted. I never should've done this. I never should've made her come. We'll find her. No, you stay, Diego. No, no, not now. We might need him to talk to her. [Sighs] Did you contact the cab companies? Excellent call on the taxis. We got a hit. Where was the pickup? Fairfax and Wessling. The fare was wearing a purple shirt and a tan trench coat. That's her. Well, drop. Off was about five minutes ago near the band shell at East Potomac Park. P.D.'s got to have a unit close. Park Rangers, FBI. On it. Annie, stand down. Units are on the way. I'm less than five away. Let somebody else do it. I have Hughes in the car. Then let him do it. Good luck with that. You might want to hold on to your gun. [Tires squeal] Oh, mi Victor. How much further? Just past the tidal basin. I knew you'd forgive me. You had no choice. Do you have my passport? It's in the car. [Plane flies overhead] We should go. Our flight's in an hour. Slow down. There it is. Stay behind it. What do we do? We wait and say our prayers. No, w-we can't. Diego, do not get out of this car. No, it's my fault she's here. [Plane flies overhead] Diego.
