 Hey, where is everybody? 
 The 2:30 jaywalk run-through. 
 Yeah, but it's not 2:30 yet. 
 That's 'cause they moved it to 2:00. 
 They sent a memo. 
 Alright, I need an update on Budapest. 
 Sorry I'm late for— 
 Surprise! 
 Hey, surprise! 
 Happy Birthday! 
 Wow! Uh... 
 That is totally unexpected. 
 I'm at a complete loss for what to say except that it's not my birthday. 
 But it will be in about six days. 
 How about we not quibble over details and you make a wish? 
 I can't blow out the candle, not if it's not my actual birthday, 'cause it's bad luck. 
 Does this mean no cake? 
 Yes, cake. Have at it. 
 There you go again, lighting up a room. 
 So the sudden craving for chai... 
 Subterfuge. 
 Auggie, you are six whole days off. 
 You don't need subterfuge. You need a calendar. 
 Oh. 
 Unless... you know some reason why I won't be here next week to celebrate. 
 Annie. 
 A word in my office when you're done here. 
 Auggie... 
 You're sending me to Paris? 
 See? Now I'm already having second thoughts. 
 But you just gave me the assignment. 
 Yeah. But you've got that look. 
 Look? What look? 
 The look that every female operative gets the first time I send her to Paris. 
 Your pupils are dilating. 
 Did you even hear what your mission was? 
 Yes! To cultivate an asset in Paris. 
 Her name is Salma Devrient. 
 She was born and raised in Clichy-Sous-Bois. 
 Her father is French. Her mother is from Aleppo. 
 She works for the Syrian embassy as the social secretary. 
 And we think she might be vulnerable why? 
 Because her fiance of the past two years just broke up with her, and she is a week late in her rent. 
 Joan, look. My pupils are fine. 
 Okay. 
 Do we think that the Syrians might be reconstituting their weapons program? 
 We think it would be helpful to have a friend inside the embassy, nothing more. 
 It's hard to believe there isn't someone in the Paris station who's in a better position to do that. 
 Are you gonna make me have third thoughts? 
 'Cause there's plenty of people who want to take this mission. 
 No. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity. 
 You've done some solid work here, Annie, but at the end of the day, it's the cultivation of intelligence assets that determines how successful you are in the CIA. 
 Assets like Salma. 
 I understand. 
 Just go and use your best judgment. 
 And bring back receipts. 
 [Au revoir Simone's] 
 [Anywhere you looked]

♪ what would you say was the matter ♪ 
♪ when we all looked at each other ♪ 
♪ when we all cried together ♪ 
♪ I was right ♪ 
♪ if we could, I'll say we're sorry... ♪ 
 So you've been there three days already. 
 What have you learned? 
 I've learned she likes her routines. 
 She's got a good eye for accessories. 
 And that she's not so crazy about her coworkers. 
 You know, you are eventually going to have to initiate contact with her. 
 This isn't a total boondoggle. 
 Is that your way of telling me you miss me? 
 Yeah, sure, joke now. 
 Wait till the bean counters get their hands on you. 
 Don't expect those excuses to hold water with accounting. 
 Or Joan, for that matter. 
 Stay focused, find your in, and all will be fine. 
 I think... I have an opening. 
 19th century portraits. 
 You call that an opening? 
 Got any good conversation starters? 
 Yeah, I do, actually, but they all require that you not be able to see. 
 Thanks. 
 [Intriguing music] 
 Did you ask for a postponement? 
 I don't want a postponement. 
 You know, I can do that thing with the guy with the strings getting pulled. 
 One phone call. 
 It's my civic duty. 
 Okay. But what if you get stuck on some OJ-like trial? 
 You could be sequestered for weeks. 
 I'm not gonna be sequestered, because I won't even be selected. 
 You don't know that. 
 If you were on trial, would you want me on your jury? 
 Can I take the fifth on that one? 
 I'll put everything together you'll need before I leave. 
 Do we have a status on Annie? 
 She's making some real progress. 
 So she hasn't established contact. 
 She's getting super-close. 
 Let's read her in on the chatter out of Damascus, okay? 
 Maybe accelerate things over there. 
 I'll get right on it. 
 I wouldn't feel comfortable reporting for jury duty if I didn't trust you to fill in, Auggie. 
 You're gonna do fine without me. 
 Okay. 
 [Bell tolls] 
 [Speaking French] 
 Why didn't you just run her down right there in the store? 
 Because, Auggie, it would have embarrassed her, confronting her in public like that. 
 I assume you staged the dummy bag. 
 Yeah. Tour guide, Metro map, key to my hotel room. 
 Smithsonian business cards. 
 Hey, guys, run a number for me. 
 43-59-14-17. 
 See if anything turns up. 
 You sure she's gonna call you back? 
 Maybe she'll like her new bag better. 
 If worse comes to worse, I'll call her later, but I want Salma to be the one who reaches out. 
 It's better if she feels responsible. 
 And what did it cost to lay this freudian trap of yours? 
 6,000. 
 Six— 
 6,000 Euros for a pocketbook? 
 Six grand's not bad. Full retail's closer to seven. 
 Can you return it when you're done or convert it into a condo? 
 You're obviously not a woman. 
 Joan will understand the underlying psychology. 
 No. Joan would not understand. 
 Oh. Hey, Joan. 
 Auggie, little heads up next time. 
 Hey, it's not like I'm the most difficult guy to sneak up on. 
 Annie, you do realize we didn't send you to Paris to scout fashion week. 
 Did you read her in yet? 
 Read me in on what? 
 There's been increased chatter out of Damascus. 
 We think Mahmoud Kanaan is on the move. 
 Chemical Kanaan's here? In Paris? 
 We don't know. It'd be nice if you could stop shopping and help us answer that question. 
 Okay. Can I get something to I.D. him with, a photo... 
 We would if we could, but we can't. 
 Chemical Kanaan is a ghost. 
 20 years flouting IAEA nonproliferation sanctions, and we still don't know what he looks like. 
 Hold on. That's my other line. 
 Okay. I don't like to use this term, but... 
 If it helps keep anyone in line while I'm out of pocket, you can say you're in charge. 
 What—he's in charge? 
 Like I said. 
 I promise not to abuse it. 
 Devrient. It's okay if you like to speak in English. 
 Merci—I mean, thank you. 
 I'm so sorry for the mix-up. 
 I didn't touch anything inside. 
 No. Of course not. Neither did I. 
 Couldn't help but wonder, though, what you paid for it. 
 Just feel like an idiot who still pays full retail. 
 I don't remember. 
 Oh. Look at me being so rude. 
 I don't even know you yet. 
 I'm already asking personal questions. 
 Won't you please sit down? 
 I really should be going. 
 Oh, please? I ordered this whole bottle of wine by mistake. 
 Verre... Bouteille. I get so confused. 
 You have to help me finish it. 
 I bought the bag after my fiance left. 
 I couldn't afford it, really. 
 But it makes you feel better. 
 We call that retail therapy in the States. 
 Retail therapy? Yes. I like that. 
 It works much better than ice cream. 
 At least until your credit runs out. 
 Yeah. You need a better-paying job. 
 Yeah. A better breed of fiance. 
 Sometimes the two come hand-in-hand. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I really should be going. 
 They embassy will want me to report my bag being missing. 
 Oh, but you got it all back in one piece. 
 I know, but they have their rules. 
 They will want me to change all the locks and passwords. 
 I know this is really last-minute, but I have to go to this black tie event tonight. 
 I don't want to go by myself. 
 It will be so boring. 
 You want to go with me? Tonight? 
 Do you already have plans? 
 Uh, no. 
 I don't know. I— I kind of met this man yesterday. 
 You little minx. You work so fast. 
 What's his name? Where'd you meet him? 
 His name is George. But it's nothing, really. 
 Not yet anyway. 
 But he said he was going to call. 
 So you're gonna go home and wait by the phone? 
 Oh ho ho... 
 Take it from me— you gotta play harder to get. 
 Do you go to party like this for work every night? 
 [Laughing] 
 Not every night. 
 Oh, I need to find the ladies' room. 
 Oh. Okay. I'll meet you right over there. 
 Okay. 
 And you didn't believe in kismet? 
 Listen, buddy, if you— 
 Bonsoir. 
 Bonsoir. Uh, this is, uh... A pleasant surprise, I hope. It is. Very much so. Who knew you were a patron of the arts? Well, what can I say? I like beautiful things. That tux does suit you. I'm contractually obligated to wear it every time I'm in Paris. It's good for the image... of the city. You seem distracted. Am I keeping you from anything? You are, actually. You don't mind if we reschedule this little reunion, do you? Enough said. I have business to attend to myself. Thank you, Eyal. Let's consider it a courtesy— one professional to the other. By the way, that switch you did with the bag... Excellent spycraft there. Well played. And much more fashionable than that titanium thing you lugged around Zurich. How do you know— George? You two know each other? Remember that man I told you about? The one I just met. This is him. Pleasure to meet you. The pleasure's all mine, George. Thank you so much for bringing me with you. I feel like Cinderella. [Laughs] Ah. Perfect timing. Thank you so much. Shall we? It's surreal, isn't it? How small is the world. And you two have so much in common. Really? George exports antiquities out of Cyprus, and Annie represents the Smithsonian Institute. Perhaps we should, uh, talk later. Oh, we should definitely talk later. How exactly did you two meet? That's a funny story, because he was here in the museum. Just yesterday. Right here? No... it was actually, uh, 19th century portraits. Yes. I was by myself after work, and from out of nowhere, George came in asking me how I felt about the brush strokes. And before I knew it, we were spending the next nine hours together. It's kismet. That's exactly what George said! Did you hear that, George? I feel like dancing. Would you care to dance? I would love to. Will you be okay on your own, Annie? Oh, of course. Don't worry about me! [Line ringing] Hey, what's up? We have a little problem. Your kid's home sick from school, you've got a big Powerpoint presentation to make, your boss is on your ass. If any of you find any of those excuses on the tips of your tongues, please leave them there. [Cell phone vibrating] I've heard them all before. In a moment, we will begin  voir dire , which is the process by which these attorneys will select or reject... Hello? You okay to talk? [Whispers] Uh... I'm okay to listen. Annie just called in from Paris. Looks like Mossad's after Salma too. They sent Eyal Leven. Uh-huh. I don't think they'd send him on a fishing expedition, so they must have a bead on something. [Quietly] Are we hearing any chatter? What? [Louder] Are we hearing any— chatter? No. Are you in the courtroom now? Mm-hmm. The Israeli desk is checking on the deconfliction protocol. I went ahead and set up a line of credit with the clearing bank in case Annie winds up in a bidding war. Okay. Well, just tell Annie no more buying bags. [Judge tapping gavel] Did I hear something banging? No. [Gavel banging] Bags. No more buying bags. Juror number nine! Are we interrupting your phone conversation? Uh... no. I— No, your honor. We may proceed with voir dire. If I have your permission. Uh, yes, of course, your honor. Voir dire away. [Laughs] Thank you, number nine. [Soft music plays] Uh... Lucky guess. I'm going to go freshen up. So they have you seducing secretaries now? And you with that tired old line about kismet. You're upset. I get that. You were so focused on following Salma, you never realized you were being followed yourself. Listen, don't beat yourself up. I'm really good at this. So you like to tell me. So how were you planning on turning her? It's the hardest thing we're tasked with. Make your pitch at the wrong time, in the wrong way, it can all blow up in your face. How are you planning on getting her to spy for Mossad? I'm not. You're not? No. I'm gonna convince an impressionable young woman to do a favor for her new lover. It's a tactic tested in the field many times. [Stammers] She will never know me as anyone but George Yiokas, a businessman from Cyprus. Don't get too cocky yet,  neshama. I still have a few cards up my sleeve. I'd keep them a little closer to my chest this time. That was awkward. I just ran into someone from work. He asked me what I was doing here. What did you tell him? You did you say? That you were an old friend from university and that George here was a private art collector trying to get lucky. [Laughs] That sounds about right. This place is feeling a little tired. How about we get out of here? Perfect idea... Shall we? Finally, some privacy. It's getting late, George. Can we drop you somewhere? What are you talking about? The night is still young. I know this great little bar in the Marais. Why don't we just drive around a bit, okay? Nothing like this ever happened to me before. I settle for the first guy who show me any interest, and even he dumped me. And now, suddenly... There is this stunning man and this so glamorous new friend fighting for my attention. And I can only come up with one explanation. You want access to the embassy. Embassy? What are you talking about? I'm pretty sure Annie works with the CIA. And if I have to guess, George here— it's not your real name, is it? It's probably MI-6. You seem too Jewish to be an actual Mossad officer. Too Jewish? I think you've had too much to drink. I think you've lost it. Whatever. Mahmoud Kanaan is coming to town tomorrow, and I know where. I've decided to auction off what I know for the highest bidder. If I'm right, I will be waiting for your offers. If I'm wrong, well... It was fun while it lasted. I totally didn't see that coming. Did you? What is it about you Americans that brings out the worst in everyone you meet? 
 
 [Line ringing] Where do we stand? I've got Salma on the other line. She says we have a deal at 50. 50,000 Euros. What happened to 30? 30 was half an hour ago, before Mossad made their final bid. And you thought the pocketbook was expensive. All right. Let me check with Joan. Why does it feel like we're bidding against ourselves? We're supposed to be allies. And there is no way Joan authorizes 50. Not even to get a bead on Kanaan. [Beeping] We are confirmed up to 50,000. Make this happen, Annie. Salma? We got a deal. Bonsoir,  Annie Walker. [Bell tolling] Typical CIA, huh? Always taking shortcuts. She was supposed to meet me at the cafe at 11:00. And me at the hotel at 11:30. She took both our offers? I'm beginning to like this girl more and more. Salma? [Distant clatter] I'll cover the street! Eyal! Who sent you? What do you want? What do you want? Qui vous envoie? Qui vous envoie? [Bell tolling] Could have at least called it in. No. It will sort itself out. Less trail we leave, the better. So what now? Now we part ways and go to ground. This is as good a place as any. Since I'm not one for teary good-byes, let's leave it at au revoir. What about Kanaan? What about Kanaan? Well, Salma obviously knew something for someone to want her dead. And you're gonna find out how? By going back to her place? Good luck with that. When I went through Salma's bag, there was something missing from the day before. A post-it with a phone number on it. It might have something to do with Kanaan. If we put our heads together— I don't do the putting together of heads. I work alone. But I think— No buts. I can't be responsible for you. We really gotta stop meeting like this. [Cell phone chirps] Okay, on three, guys. One, two, three. All : Happy Birthday! I hope we didn't wake you up in Topeka or Des Moines or wherever you are today. We've got you on a new return flight at 1600 hours. Auggie, is there a train arriving at Gare de Lyon at... 2:17? Yes. From Marseille. Why? I think I know where Kanaan's going to be. And you've been working at the world bank for how long? 11 years altogether, Seven in development in the Balkans and the last four... [Cell phone vibrating] And in your capacity at the World Bank, have you come in contact with anyone— I'm... sorry. Would it be possible to request a recess? A recess. It might be difficult for you, juror 9, as a banker, to fully grasp the concept of doing your civic duty. But I can assure you that unlimited texting does not fall under its umbrella. Marshal, confiscate juror 9's phone, please. [Marshal snapping] Any news? Joan's not getting back to me. I meant on Kanaan. Annie thinks he might be arriving at the Gare de Lyon in 15 minutes. Well, can she get there in time? Already in route. Waiting for you to make a decision. Salma's dead. Mossad's already gone to ground, and Annie might be burned. Plus, we have no idea what this guy even looks like. Which makes getting a photo of him all the more valuable. Joan would bring her in. But you're not Joan. Hey, guys, book Annie on a later return flight. She needs another hour. Or two. You got it, Auggie. Any idea how she's supposed to take a picture of someone when no one knows who she's looking for? [French PA announcements in background] Hey! Fais attention idiot! Did you get it? Got it. That's a good picture. The frame... The mise-en-scene... Ah, ah. Go on. Yeah? What do you want? You want an award? No. I'm not a prideful person. It's always nice, a few accolades, though. Oh, you want accolades. All right. Here's some for you. You have a little game, Annie Walker. I've seen a few in action. So many have trouble improvising, but you... you have some gears to shift into. And you have, uh, great interpersonal skills. See, I agree, but my family doesn't think so. Family? My sister. She thinks I'm lying and secretive and isolated. She also thinks I'm in Topeka. And you're close with her. Very. But she doesn't know... Anything. That's how the agency likes it. Hmm. And you? I used to tell my wife everything. You did? That's how Mossad likes it. They think it helps to have someone at home who knows where you are, what you're doing. Helps tether you to something concrete. Of course, then they get to worry about you instead of living blissfully in ignorance... So in a way, it's kind of selfish to tell them. Or at least, that's what my wife said when she was leaving me. Are you gonna tell me how you found me at that train station? Or was it just a lucky guess? Just... Good trade craft. Mm. I don't believe in luck. Really? So what time's your flight? You up for one more or, uh, you gotta call it quits? I think I have time for one more. But only if you come clean about the train station. Deal. Oh, hey, hold on a second. You have a little, uh... Little schmutz on your collar here. Merci. No problem. Oh, and have them make mine a little dirtier next time. The man that was sitting right here— Taxi...! Arrête! Arrête! [rapid beeping] [Beep] Talk to me. My location? 49 and 03 degrees north, 3 and 56 east, just outside Epernay. Now, hang tight. The cavalry's on the way. Yeah. I need more details than that. 15, 20 minutes tops. Remember that course they taught at the farm? How if you're captured... You've got an hour or so to escape? And after that, the odds of survival go to... Next to nothing. Yeah. They've had Eyal for over an hour now. Annie... you're what— one against four, five? They have a video camera, Auggie. And you're not even armed. He doesn't have anyone looking out for him but me. Okay. Let's work the problem. Tell me everything you see. You okay? Some explosion. You cleared the room. I assume you have a way out of here? Yeah. There's a truck outside. The keys are in the ignition. I checked. [Door slams] Shh! [Engine won't turn] Any chance you've been issued a gun yet? Not yet. Yeah. This is a good plan. Let's go! [Gunshots] [Indistinct shouting] [Trigger cocks] [Gunshot] [Muffled] Oh! [Sirens approach] What do you think? Ha ha ha. They suit you. You could have pulled out my shoes, out of that van, before you blew it up. Well, maybe if you were more interested in watching your back instead of stealing my memory card... Yeah. Yeah, well, that was painfully easy, wasn't it? The schmutz on the collar routine. A red flag should have gone up when you brought out the yiddish. Where is my memory card, by the way? You didn't. The photo of Kanaan! Something for the higher-ups to figure out. Le train de 20h35 en direction de l'aéroport Charles de Gaulle... That's me. Right. I forgot to get a receipt from the cab when I went to the farmhouse. Well, we can take care of that. Hold on a second. What are you doing? I don't know about Langley, but these work fine for Mossad. So how much did it cost you? 500 euro. 500? Wow. You got totally ripped off. You would have done the same thing for me. At those prices... Not a chance. You don't want to miss your plane. Right. If you're still sitting in the box, then you will be serving on this jury. Now, I can see this trial going one of two ways. It could carry on for an extended period of time, or we could be out of here in three weeks. So let's get comfortable. Yes, number 9. Your honor, I know this might sound self-aggrandizing, but I cannot sit on a three-week trial. My job needs me. You're right, number 9. I do hear the sound of your own horn tooting. Sit down. [Sighs] Now, it is useful for you to know what the various parts of the trial are. Can I borrow your phone, please? ... that you may be aware throughout the trial what stage of the proceedings is in.. I will pay you $20. progress and what comes next. The trial starts with opening statements by the lawyers, and then they will state the nature of their factual and legal claims. Opening statements are not proof of evidence... [Whispers] Thank you. [Whispers] You're welcome. Now, so that you will be aware as you hear the evidence of the legal claim— [door opens] Excuse me. Thank you. Juror number 9. You have been excused from serving on this jury. The court would like to thank you for your service to your community. Thank you, your honor. Can I have my phone, please? Excuse me. Excuse me. Mossad just cabled this over. They tell me it's a nice shot. Well, at least we know he's not a figment of our imagination. Hmm. It's not easy, is it... Making decisions that affect your friends' safety? No, it's not. Got news for you. Doesn't get any easier. [Soft pop song] ♪ ♪ I thought I heard you come in. Oh. I didn't want to wake you. Um... Thank you so much for the message that you sent. It came at the perfect time. You will never know how much that meant to me. So how was Topeka? Actually... I didn't go to Topeka. I went to Paris. Paris? As in Paris, Paris? Oui. How did that happen? It was a last-minute thing at work. Oh-my-freaking-God! That's exactly what I said when they told me— Just like that. You little scamp. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I feel horrible about it. It's okay. No. It's not okay. It's not. Is that what I think it is? Yeah. I wanted to spoil myself for my birthday. Good for you. You deserve it. Now, this might not be high fashion... [Laughs] But it is homemade. Happy Birthday.
