 [Honks horn, tires squeal] 
 Everything's gonna be fine, Chloe. 
 You just bumped your head. 
 I told your mom we're going to get it checked out. 
 We just need to get to the hospital now. 
 Why don't we just take an ambulance? 
 Because your Aunt Annie is much faster. 
 Oh! Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. My niece fell and bumped her head. 
 I'm Dr. Weiss, head bumping specialist. 
 I'm Annie Walker, derelict babysitter. 
 And your niece's name? 
 Chloe. 
 Let's get Chloe to bed three. 
 Come with me, dear. 
 How long ago did she fall? 
 Nine minutes and 48 seconds ago. 
 I timed it. 
 Any vomiting or-- 
 Loss of consciousness, blurred vision? 
 No. 
 Are you seeing spots now? 
 Mm-mm. 
 They were playing dress-up. 
 No, we weren't playing dress-up. 
 We were putting on a fashion show. 
 Catwalk can be a dangerous place. 
 Okay, why don't we have Nurse Patty take a look, and I'm gonna talk to your aunt. 
 I don't see any sign of a hematoma. 
 We should order a CAT scan. 
 You were just getting to that. 
 But I'll order a CAT scan, and we'll monitor her. 
 I should have been watching her more closely. 
 She's gonna be fine. 
 I'm sorry for being such a pain. 
 I'll forget all about it if you meet me for coffee. 
 Twist my arm. A drink. 
 Boy, do you drive a hard bargain. 
 Okay, lunch, and that is my final offer. 
 I--I could be a crazy person. 
 You probably are. 
 But you obviously care a lot about your nieces. 
 Can't be all bad. 
 I'm free on Friday. 
 I got here as soon as I could. Is she okay? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Uh, this is my sister, Danielle. 
 Dr. Weiss, Chloe's mom. 
 Nothing to worry about at all. 
 Annie took every precaution. 
 Oh, my honey! 
 I need to step out for a minute. 
 Uh, prescription? 
 My phone number. To coordinate lunch. Friday. 
 Right. Thanks. 
 I'm sorry. 
 How did you know I was here? 
 You track my cell phone signal? 
 You know what? I don't want to know. 
 Just gonna lead to more questions. 
 The Agency's having an emergency of its own. 
 An instructor at the Farm leaked the identity of a top recruit. 
 The name's Roy Gaskin. 
 He's a weapons, tactics, and training instructor. 
 Why don't I recognize him? 
 He was transferred after you were pulled. 
 A trainee he burned is Laura Taylor. 
 Like you, she was a linguist with a level-five proficiency in multiple European and Slavic languages. 
 Her name and picture were posted on a pet care message board. 
 Pet care? 
 It's a front for the Iranian Intelligence Ministry. 
 One stop shopping for fido and foreign intelligence. 
 Past 12 years, Roy ran ops in Iran and Afghanistan. 
 During his last assignment, he was captured by militants in the Logar Province. 
 That's when we think he was turned. 
 Under duress, even the best operatives can be turned. 
 Couple that with unexplained absences, unusual behavior, and we have our mole. 
 Why hasn't he been pulled? 
 No hard evidence. 
 We isolated the post to an I.P. address in the general area of the Farm, but it's not Roy's work computer. 
 He must have a laptop. 
 And we need to find it. 
 That's where I come in? 
 You have a legitimate reason for going back to the Farm. 
 I can complete my gun training. 
 And as far as the Agency goes, that's all it would be. 
 The assignment, if you choose to accept it, will be compartmentalized for maximum secrecy. 
 You're giving me an out? 
 If you're burned, that's it. 
 You're done with the CIA. 
 Laura Taylor got a nonstop ticket back to Omaha. 
 Promising career with the Agency over, shattered. 
 It would be the same for you, Annie. 
 Which is why you need to be sure. 
 Maybe we should give you a minute? 
 I don't need a minute. 
 I'm sure. I'm in.

 You looking forward to cafeteria food and PT drills? 
 Sure. 
 I get to compete with the best for a job I already have. 
 Don't knock continuing education. 
 At this rate, I might not make it to the Farm at all. 
 Is the weather that bad? 
 Higher elevations are reporting snow. 
 Maybe this time you'll get snow shoe training. 
 Okay, Mr. Sunshine. 
 Tell me what I'm missing in Roy's file. 
 Short answer, Logar Province. 
 Where he was captured? 
 Yeah, Roy admitted he made a mistake. 
 That mistake got him and another operative captured. 
 Rumor is it wasn't an accident. 
 They think Roy set an operative up? 
 Oh, this is starting to open up. 
 I might make it to the Farm after all. 
 Okay, remember the rules. 
 I know, I know. Leave the phone in the car. 
 And use extreme discretion on the campus pay phone. 
 Oh, and good luck. 
 Once you go through that gate, the mission is live. 
 [Buzzer] 
 You guys go through. 
 Clear underneath. 
 We're clear. 
 [Buzzer] 
 All right. Open up! 
 [Panting] 
 You're the new recruit? 
 Yeah. Uh, Annie Walker. 
 I was told to report to Roy Gaskin. 
 That's me. That's your team. 
 You better hustle over there with them. 
 I explain an exercise only once. 
 The embassy you are now standing in has been overrun by hostiles. 
 You will each have one opportunity to escape. 
 You can choose an item from here to help you. 
 All firearms are loaded, because they are loaded in real life. 
 You can only choose one item, so choose wisely.

 Are you too precious for guns? 
 No. 
 Then why take this map? 
 I didn't finish my gun training. 
 I left the program early because I injured my knee. 
 Ah. So we have a quitter. 
 Well, she just got here. Come on. 
 It should come as no surprise to you that you'd all be dead. 
 What? No way. 
 Yeah, way. You all failed. 
 All of you except Annie Oakley here. 
 But she didn't even shoot anyone. 
 Yeah. 
 Ironically, her ignorance saved her ass. 
 Guns are a last resort. 
 Anyone discharging their weapon is blowing their cover and putting their fellow operatives and potentially an entire operation at risk. 
 This is your greatest weapon. 
 In fact, those training manuals you were issued, burn 'em. 
 The last thing the Agency needs is more jarheads turning the organization into a bunch of gun-toting paramilitary thugs. 
 You want to kill terrorists, you want to pop off a few rounds, join the FBI. 
 Class dismissed. 
 If I'd known the instructor was such a hard-ass, I would have tried harder to finish the first time. 
 Well, at least all the recruits are cool. 
 I mean, Shireen gives these awesome pep talks. 
 And if that doesn't cheer you up, you can always get drunk, right? 
 Did the campus bar finally get a liquor license? 
 Uh, no, they're still serving seltzer water and root beer, but my bunkmate, Corey, he sneaks in whiskey every now and then. 
 My roommate seems a little intense. 
 Emerson. Yeah, uh, good luck with that. 
 Well, you said everyone's cool. 
 Well, by "everyone," I meant, um, everyone except Emerson. 
 See you later. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Hey, I'm Annie. I'm your new-- 
 Knee injury girl. 
 Yeah, I heard. 
 How is it they let you come back to the Farm? 
 I guess I performed pretty well before my injury, so they gave me another shot. 
 Hey, Billy Collins. 
 He wrote one of my favorite poems of all time. 
 I brought him with me the last time I was here. 
 My old roommate Laura left that behind. 
 I doubt she's getting a do-over, so I guess that means it's yours now. 
 Surprised you didn't personalize the place. 
 You know? 
 Hang a few photos. 
 Small touches can really make a big difference. 
 Nesting advice. 
 What, are you trying to get to Langley to bag a husband? 
 Case officers don't have the luxury of nesting. 
 And I did make a few small changes. 
 I painted the walls white. 
 I'm gonna unpack before going down to the bar. 
 I'm not waiting. 
 They're gonna post the new rankings soon. 
 Oh, and lights out is at 9:00. 
 You don't really go to sleep at 9:00, do you? 
 Yes, I do. Every night. 
 Course you do. 
 What? 
 I'll see you down at the bar. 
 [Knocking at door] 
 I was hoping I could have a word. 
 Yeah, sure. What's on your mind? 
 I think I've done a pretty good job of filling in where I was needed. 
 No argument here. 
 Thing is, given my skills, my experience, I'm not the guy that should be filling in. 
 Let's face it. Anyone else would have made a play for the corner office by now, or gone over to the NSA. 
 To get a better office and a parking space to go with it? 
 I stayed because I assumed my responsibilities would expand. 
 Well, you're welcome to hand in your resignation if you'd like. 
 Hmm. 
 I assume there'll be some fallout from the case against Arthur. 
 The situation's being handled. 
 Nobody's expecting Arthur to get marched out of the building. 
 I mean, if it happens at all, it'll start slowly. 
 First Arthur's people in the Tanzania station will get shipped back to Langley. 
 Then the station chief in Stockholm will get the boot. 
 You done? 
 Just being frank here. 
 And you've succeeded, and now I have work to do. 
 [Door closes] 
 Now, we can't move forward until all the questions regarding the CIA cover-up have been answered. 
 I personally tried to get Arthur Campbell on the telephone many times. 
 I mean, I've said, "Let's sit down and talk about this." 
 I couldn't help it. 
 Why not just meet with him? 
 He's a power-hungry senator. 
 A sit-down would only further inflate his ego. 
 And he'll use it to come after me even harder. 
 Or it could silence him. 
 Talking to Gottfried won't resolve our legal issues. 
 We've hired Chet to handle the case, and that'll have to be enough. 
 For now. 
 I bet this is what Laura misses most. 
 She loved it. 
 The root beer? 
 Oh, her family was strict. 
 Didn't allow soda. 
 What? No, wait. How is this possible? 
 Whoa. Way to go, Annie Oakley. 
 [Laughs] 
 Number one. 
 After one exercise. 
 Well, no, rankings are cumulative. 
 Annie must have aced all the exercises before her injury. 
 She's mad because she thought she had the top spot in the bag after Laura was cut. 
 Yeah, it's-- it's not a big deal. 
 Oh, right. Yeah, it only determines whether you get to be James Bond or James not-so-Bond. 
 Top third of the class is gonna work in clandestine operations. 
 Mm-hmm, and the bottom third will be like me, working D.S.T. at a Langley. 
 Don't get me wrong. 
 That's where I want to be, with all the high-tech toys. 
 My dad says we're not gonna use half the stuff we're being tested on anyways-- seals and flaps, lock picking, detection routes. 
 Yeah, I'd--I'd love to get to D.S.T. without having to jump out of a plane. 
 [Laughter] 
 Aw. Well, maybe the cocktail parties will help some tech guys be a little less dull. 
 Now there's a skill we're gonna use in Kabul, working the Taliban cocktail party circuit, right? 
 Exercises are just to see if you can stay cool under pressure. 
 You know, talk your way out of a difficult situation. 
 Knowing cold war spy craft will not make you a great spy. 
 Clearly not, Corey. 
 You're, like, what? Tenth on the list? 
 Thanks. 
 Well, not all of us have Agency dads and two brothers in special ops. 
 Yeah, but, Shireen, you've got something even better-- level-five Farsi. 
 The Agency would sell a hundred of us techies for one of you. 
 Meanwhile we're being judged on whether we took a different route back to campus after weekend breaks. 
 Even though we know we weren't followed. 
 You don't want to do detection routes, Corey, then don't. 
 But don't be surprised if you find yourself in a dark cave in the Khost-Gardez pass in Afghanistan, getting beat with Kalashnikovs. 
 Sweet dreams, campers. 
 Well, I--I think it's time for some Jack. 
 What do you say? 
 I need to get back to my room. 
 I think that I've found what I've been looking for. 
 It's compact and easy to carry. 
 Is it a fruit? 
 Yep, but it's not a Granny Smith. 
 Am I clear to exit? 
 You're on the list. 
 Good. Stay by the phone. 
 Thank you. 
 Name's not here. 
 What? 
 Uh, no, that can't be. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Security. 
 What? Really? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Go on through. Go. 
 Thanks, Auggie. 
 Well, considering the poor health of your grandmother, it'd be cruel not to let you leave campus. 
 Be careful. If what I'm told is true, your car isn't the most inconspicuous color. 
 I didn't know I was gonna be tailing spies when I bought it. 
 This trip might not be worth it. 
 This guy's got skills. 
 [Horn honks] 
 You're no slouch when it comes to defensive driving. 
 I definitely prefer driving to guns. 
 Here we go. 
 [Horn honks] 
 At least you're being cautious. 
 Go get 'em, Walker. 
 [Horn honks, indistinct chatter] 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Knocks] 
 Emerson, it's me. 
 I don't have my key card. 
 Emerson. I'm sorry about being late. 
 I'm trying to sleep. 
 Well, if I have to go to operations and report I'm locked out, I'll get a demerit for breaking curfew. 
 Too bad. 
 I swear it won't happen again. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Bird calls] 
 Mornin'. 
 This is an odd choice. 
 Most runners prefer the roads near the creek. 
 Fewer cars here. 
 You need firearms training, right? 
 Yeah, if I ever intend to graduate. 
 Got a few minutes. 
 I'll give you a primer. Climb in. 
 Come on. Get in. 
 [Engine starts] 
 You got a demerit last night. 
 Yeah, I got into it with my roommate, found myself locked out. 
 You let off some steam? 
 Took a little break. 
 I received permission to visit my grandmother in Richmond. 
 She's sick, so I did. 
 That's a lie, actually. 
 Last night I got in the car and just drove. 
 I thought it'd be less stressful at the Farm second time around. 
 It's not. 
 Thought we were going to the shooting range. 
 Oh, that won't be necessary. 
 When you face a target, real target, and your heartbeat is ringing in your ears, your focus is just completely clear. 
 [Bird calls] 
 It's afterwards things become complicated. 
 Your turn. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Bend. 
 The Agency's all about learning by doing. 
 That's how you become an elite. 
 Of course, if mistakes are made, they'll try to bury you. 
 Ho! That's not bad for somebody with no training. 
 My dad used to take me hunting. 
 Little father-daughter bonding moment? 
 He thought so. I wasn't into it. 
 Well, you're into it now, Oakley. 
 That's it? 
 For today. Good job. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. I was thinking of skipping this one. 
 The lecture hasn't started yet? 
 No, the D.S.T. officer that was scheduled to be here is sick. 
 [Insect buzzing] 
 Replacement's probably some lowly intern. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. 
 This way, sir. 
 I'm glad I didn't skip. 
 Check it out. 
 I know you were expecting the foremost expert in audio surveillance technology. 
 Eh, you got me instead. 
 The blind guy. 
 Word of warning, the room is bugged. 
 Literally. 
 Welcome to the future of remote-controlled surveillance. 
 Oh, and to my friend in the back, I'm not an intern. 
 Need some one-on-one time to get through the content. 
 Really? 
 Somebody's hot for teacher. 
 Oh, audio surveillance tactics is scintillating stuff. 
 Oh. 
 We alone? 
 Yeah. 
 I've got a bit of technological wizardry for you too. 
 I knew this wasn't a social call. 
 Our mole isn't a PC guy, so we had to scramble a bit, but she should download four gigabytes in less than a minute. 
 I only saw his laptop once. 
 The cocktail party exercise is tonight. 
 While Roy and the other instructors are grilling the trainees on their covers, we'll peek into his office. 
 We? 
 I'll talk you through it. 
 I think Roy might be on to me. 
 He made you? Last night? 
 No. Maybe. I don't know. 
 I can't get a bead on this guy, and if I mess this up-- 
 You don't do it. He could still burn you. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'll check out the faculty building and find the best way in. 
 I'll be right there with you. 
 
 
 
 [Soft jazz playing] 
 Is it just me, or does everyone in here look like they're about to walk the plank? 
 Memorizing our covers. 
 Civil engineer from South Africa. Three PhDs. 
 You can pull that off no problem. 
 Makes more sense than growing up in Beverly Hills ever did. 
 Darn it. Darn it. 
 Something wrong with your cover, Gideon? 
 Ask me about computational simulation, parallel computing, wavelets. 
 Anything but this. 
 It can't be that bad. 
 My name is unpronounceable. 
 Akshayakeerti Sathyanarayan. 
 Well, that doesn't help me at all. Thank you. 
 Why don't you just make up a cover, Gideon? 
 You're a genius, right? 
 Kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? 
 No, no. No, my dad says it's all about consistency. 
 See, you just don't contradict yourself, you'll be fine. 
 That might fly if the instructors were being served real wine. 
 Maybe. 
 You're gonna pull through, Gideon. 
 Well, if I'm lucky, I'll bomb, and they'll kick me out before the skydiving. 
 Excuse me. 
 [Speaking foreign language] 
 [All chatter] 
 I did my undergraduate at Stanford and I switched over... 
 People call me Joe. J-o-e. 
 Uh, you see, the only three letters that aren't in my name. 
 It is, actually. 
 It's hard to say, 'cause it's in the back of the throat. 
 ...Post doctorate program... 
 I worked in-- in a nuclear reactor. 
 You look familiar. 
 Wish I could say the same. 
 Uh, Laurieanne Bertran. 
 And--and you are? 
 Doctor Stevens. 
 Throws a lot of people, surgeon being so young. 
 A surgeon? 
 Neurology. Go ahead and laugh. 
 No, I find it fascinating. 
 How a blind guy can perform brain surgery? 
 Actually, I performed a lengthy procedure earlier today. 
 It took me three hours and 15 minutes. 
 Really? 
 I like to think of the brain as having three distinct floors. 
 Earlier today I entered through the bottom level and followed a recessed stem. 
 Kind of like a staircase? 
 Took me to the top level, where I bypassed the first three sections and went into the fourth. 
 I'm in. 
 And the laptop? 
 Annie? 
 Got it. 
 It's password protected. 
 Insert the flash drive. 
 If we're lucky, the level of encryption won't be too deep. 
 Okay, we're in. 
 He has what appears to be a list of dates and times, and the last entry was last night. 
 The night he was at the bus station. 
 We might have something. 
 Okay, we're done. 
 Good work. I'll meet you outside. 
 What the hell is this? 
 What are you doing in my office? 
 I--I know how this must look. 
 Hey, Sugar Plum, have you seen my other sock? 
 What the hell do you think this is? 
 What--what is this? A game to you? 
 The only office with a couch. 
 CSTs get cut for less than this. 
 Look, it's my mistake, all right? 
 My first since returning from an unfortunate incident in Baghdad, and I think you can see I lost a hell of a lot more than my luggage. 
 I apologize. 
 I'd appreciate it if we'd acknowledge it was poor judgment and move on. 
 Get out. Now. 
 Ugh. 
 Did you get the flash drive? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought your accident happened in Tikrit. 
 Ah, the important thing is it worked. 
 I suggest you lay low, stay away from Roy while the team uploads the data. 
 He's probably posting my name on the message board right now, in which case this will be our last conversation. 
 No, you're not getting rid of me that easily. 
 Okay, Sugar Plum. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, I was improvising. 
 It was either that or "Pooh Bear." 
 Now go for a drive. 
 Give your niece Chloe a call. 
 Oh, no! 
 What? 
 You said she was fine. 
 Uh, she is. I'll--I'll check in later. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Dr. Weiss. 
 Hey, Scott, uh, it's Annie. 
 Annie. You're not calling to cancel, are you? 
 Actually, I have this big work project, and--and I'm gonna be tied up for several days. 
 It's for something at the Smithsonian? 
 Yeah, we're--we're... 
 How did you know I work at the Smithsonian? 
 Your sister told me. In the E.R. 
 What, is the project not going well? 
 No, it's--it's looking up. 
 We're just waiting on a few confirmations. 
 Well, if you're in a holding pattern, we could get together now. 
 Well, I'm in Williamsburg, and, uh, I only have a small window of time. 
 I learned the hard way that with a schedule like mine you got to seize the moment, so how about I drive down and we grab a quick bite to eat? 
 You got to eat, right? 
 If you turn me down, I'm gonna be forced to accept that you're giving me the brush off, and honestly I don't think your sister would be able to take that.

 Drop the Doe-eyed routine! 
 I know the Agency cooked up the idea that I was the one leaking the names of the trainees. 
 Are you? 
 I have given 20 years to the Agency. 
 Ames gave 25. Nicholson 12. 
 They both sold classified information to the Russians. 
 Did Langley give you anything to support their cockamamie theory? 
 No, no, of course not. 
 'Cause my problems began when I made it out of Logar Province and my buddy didn't. 
 And the Agency, in their infinite wisdom, decided that I set up my friend. 
 My friend of 15 years!

 Why the late-night, clandestine meetings? 
 That was my wife. 
 We want to have a family. 
 Couple of kids. Simple enough, right? 
 Nope, not for us. 
 We've been seeing all these damn doctors. 
 The laptop is the only way to keep track of all the tests and trials and cycles and prescriptions. 
 This is our fourth attempt. 
 We can't afford a fifth. 
 I have only myself to blame. 
 I convinced my wife to put family on the back burner while I went and ran clandestine operations in backwater countries. 
 And look at us now. 
 No family. 
 And the office that I have sacrificed everything for is calling me a traitor. 
 I believe you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yeah, since you showed up, I've been looking more closely at the people who might have leaked. 
 Got any leads? 
 Whoever it is is good. 
 If I had to guess, I'd say it's a trainee. 
 Somebody who doesn't like to be outshone. 
 That's nearly every trainee at the Farm. 
 What if we were wrong about this? 
 What do you mean? 
 What if someone on the team is calling the plays, not the coach? 
 Well, I suppose it's possible, but the coach has more latitude. 
 Yeah, but a crafty teammate can figure out how to get beyond the gate. 
 So it could be anybody. 
 Stay together. Move, move! 
 I got to go. 
 Annie. 
 More lawyers? 
 The herd trampling through the D.P.D.? 
 No, they're operatives. 
 Station personnel is being downsized. 
 What station? 
 Tanzania. 
 I'm going home. 
 What should I tell Joan? 
 Whatever you want. 
 Senator Gottfried. 
 Arthur Campbell. 
 Thought you would have insisted on meeting at a restaurant, like Citronelle or The Oval. 
 Why is that? 
 More public. 
 It's all theater for you, isn't it? 
 You smear my name and you make one for yourself. 
 I was hoping you'd see this as an opportunity. 
 Rough waters ahead. 
 You're gonna need help navigating them. 
 This is not the place I'd come to for help. 
 You know, the committee may have sided with you, but I know at least two members who are rooting against you. 
 And how do I know you aren't one of 'em? 
 Well, that's your job, isn't it? 
 Separating the lies from the truth? 
 I hear you're a golfer. 
 I don't get out as much as I'd like, but, yes. 
 Well, I'm a member at Congressional. 
 Why don't you come by on Saturday and play 18? 
 I'll give you four strokes, and still you won't beat me. 
 I'll enjoy trying. 
 We're at 13,000 feet. 
 First jump of the series for most of you. 
 It's both the easiest and the hardest. 
 And the only way to fail is to be on this plane when it lands. 
 So if I fall to my death, does that mean I still pass? 
 I'll go first, then Annie, since she's the veteran. 
 Let's do it. 
 Emerson, what is your problem? 
 You were wasting time. 
 You know what, we're all gonna get out. 
 Unfortunately. 
 You go after Annie. 
 Yeah, maybe you should just push me out. 
 Come on. We all got to do it. 
 You owe me, dude. 
 All those times I let you back on campus after your whiskey runs? 
 You can't do me this one favor? 
 Corey, how'd you find whiskey in a dry county? 
 I couldn't even get a decent bottle of wine. 
 I got a friend hooks me up. 
 Yeah, and he'd have, like, a zillion demerits if I didn't let him back in. 
 You're exaggerating. 
 Hey, I saved your ass just the other night after the cocktail party. 
 Gideon, can you go next? 
 I have to double check my gear. 
 For you, Annie? 
 Tell my mother I love her. 
 You got whiskey the night Shireen was cut? 
 Yeah, I knew everybody'd be bummed. So? 
 Nobody knew Shireen was gonna be cut until this morning.

 This class has overcome tremendous challenges and loss, and I consider it an honor to welcome you to the United States Central Intelligence Agency. 
 Please rise. 
 Annie Walker. 
 [Applause] 
 Whoo! 
 Now you're ready for the CIA. 
 ♪ Better hold your lover down ♪ 
 Gideon Phillips. 
 Put a gold star on that certificate, Oakley? 
 Least they could do after everything you've been through. 
 I'm just happy the Agency is helping Laura and Shireen get positions at the State Department. 
 We should have seen the problem with Corey. 
 We didn't. 
 Why do you think he did it? 
 Oh, some people have to beat everybody to feel big. 
 And the Iranians were there to help him do it. 
 Having a dad and brothers in the CIA can be tough. 
 The need to measure up is great. 
 Try and remember that when your kid comes along. 
 You know, you're gonna have a long career, Oakley. 
 Give you some advice? 
 Don't sacrifice everything. 
 At the end of the day, it's just a job. 
 Remember that. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 ...He never left the Green Zone. 
 [Laughter] 
 Arthur? Joan. 
 I'm sorry to interrupt. 
 I had to tell Arthur how happy I am that he took my advice and you spoke to Gottfried. 
 He was quite impressed. 
 That right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I doubt you'll be seeing any more trouble from him. 
 Good to hear. Thanks. 
 Enjoy your dinner. 
 Thank you.
