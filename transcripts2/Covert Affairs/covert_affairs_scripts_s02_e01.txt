 Polygraph four, mission debrief. 
 Question for control. 
 Your name is Ben Mercer? 
 Yes. 
 And you are a, um... 
 [Whispers] 
 CIA operative. 
 I think that's a question for Arthur Campbell. 
 Yes or no answers, please. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yes. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You recently completed a locate-and-rescue assignment in Sri Lanka? 
 Yes. 
 And on said mission, did you, in any way, try to deceive the CIA? 
 No. 
 And yet, you left your fellow operatives and went into a hostage situation alone? 
 I was trying to protect operative Annie Walker from harm, yes. 
 And then you were shot. 
 Yes. 
 But someone saved you. Who? 
 I thought this was yes or no? 
 Oh, yeah, um... 
 Did I save you? 
 Yes. 
 And I am very grateful. 
 Mm, increased heart rate. 
 Spike in blood pressure. 
 I think the polygraph is getting to you. 
 I think it's the polygrapher. 
 And I think you should dismiss the nurse.

 I prefer Guam. 
 That's 'cause you have a problem with authority. 
 No. No, I just liked having a room with an ocean view. 
 Hey! 
 It's good to see you. 
 You too. I knew I preferred Guam. 
 For the record, you do have a problem with authority. 
 For the record, I don't consider you an authority figure. 
 We can help you transfer to the bed. 
 No, no, no. I got it myself. 
 Let us help you. 
 No, no. Got it. 
 Accepting help is not a sign of weakness. 
 You should know. 
 This isn't about me. 
 It's about your pride. 
 That's what got you injured in the first place. 
 Guys, can we just not...? 
 Jai, I'll meet you in the courtyard. 
 Okay. 
 Here. 
 Oh, what's this? 
 Paperwork already? 
 Langley's bureaucracy is a joke. 
 No, it's books of Sudokus. 
 Thought it might help you pass the time, and...you're an asshole. 
 I actually really like these. 
 Yeah, he knew that. 
 I'll apologize to him. 
 You had a long day. I'll let you get settled in. 
 I'll be back soon. 
 Is there anything I can get you? 
 You know what I would love? 
 A five guys cheeseburger. 
 I've been craving one of those ever since I left D.C. 
 You've been gone a long time. 
 That's quite a craving. You have no idea. 
 You got it. 
 Don't forget to check if we're being tailed. 
 After Guam, we can't be too careful. 
 This isn't my first rodeo. 
 Ben was a little touchy back there. 
 He's been through a lot. 
 He's gonna go through a lot more. 
 It's not gonna be easy for a guy like that. 
 A guy like Ben? 
 He's only comfortable alone. 
 In the field. 
 Nobody at Langley sees him behind a desk. 
 What is gonna happen to him? 
 Honestly? 
 No clue. None whatsoever. 
 Hey! 
 You're back! Hi. 
 Mm! 
 Rough business trip? 
 Trip was fine. 
 It's just business. 
 Well, you've been gone a while. 
 I can't believe there was that much to do in Lamar, Missouri. 
 The Smithsonian wanted the exhibit of Harry Truman's birthplace to be really detailed. 
 Thanks for the postcards. 
 Who knew the world's largest ball of yarn was in Missouri? 
 Yeah. Who knew? 
 [Giggles] 
 How's things here? 
 Crazy. Hectic. 
 Michael's been traveling a ton for work, the storm gutter guy keeps canceling on me, and Katia's been faking being sick to get out of school. 
 Danielle, what's this? 
 Oh, a police report. 
 Someone broke into the garage. 
 They didn't take anything, but we filed a report anyway. 
 When was this? 
 Mm, couple nights ago. 
 What about my guest house? 
 I told you, they didn't take anything. 
 I checked your place. It's fine. 
 I'm, uh-- I'm just gonna go freshen up. 
 Welcome back. 
 [Beeps] 
 Annie Walker. 
 Auggie. 
 How do you do that? 
 I'm not wearing perfume, these heels, although fantastic, are hardly unique. 
 I don't get it. What would you say if I told you you projected a warm fuzzy aura that I can sense? 
 I'd say you were trying to butter me up for something. 
 I could use a ride to Allen's Tavern after work. 
 Ah-ha! The truth emerges. 
 Hey, did you send my sister those postcards to sub my cover trip? Nice touch, right? 
 I had a guy from S.M.T. replicate your handwriting. 
 Figured it was better than me doing it. 
 I'm glad you're back. 
 It's good to be back. I think. 
 Someone broke into my sister's house. 
 That's a potential red flag. 
 Anything stolen? 
 No. I did a level one sweep, but all my cover docs were still in place. 
 Aren't you glad we had you install that safe? 
 I'll try to organize a larger sweep of the property. 
 What's all this? 
 Joan assigned me and my team to try to figure out who attacked you and Ben in the hospital, and why. 
 It was close. We barely made it out. 
 Yep. 
 But you did. 
 Always do. 
 The world has not stood still in your absence. 
 Really, what's going on? 
 Liza Hearn stepped up her game. 
 She's published several articles in the last three weeks that are scathing indictments of Arthur. 
 What'd they say? 
 They cited leaked material. 
 Three highly sensitive documents. 
 Three documents? That's it? 
 No, it's like a laser pointer of nasty instead of the massive, gaseous cloud of pain that is Wikileaks. I'll tell you what, hasn't made Joan much fun to be around. 
 If you two are done chit chatting, there is actual work to be done. 
 Annie. My office. 
 ♪ Welcome back ♪ 
 [Sarcastic giggles] 
 [Sighs] 
 How are you feeling? 
 Good. 
 Happy to be back. 
 You know, a lot of operatives would need some time to decompress after what you just went through. 
 Not me. I'm good. 
 Seriously. 
 Asset interaction. 
 Alo Morozov. 
 A heartwarming Estonian tale of a man pulling himself up out of abject Soviet poverty by money laundering, drug trafficking, and the occasional contract hit to pad out the 401k. 
 He's Estonian, but his file was generated on the Russia desk? 
 Yes. 
 We suspect him of being a facilitator for the Kremlin in the new Estonian rare earths mining operation. 
 He's a front. They're mining for promethium. 
 Despite the START treaties, the Russians are having a hard time kicking their nuclear habit. 
 How do you want me to get to Morozov? 
 Morozov is too dangerous and too well-protected to approach. 
 We've been targeting this woman. 
 Nadia Levandi. 
 Ranked 79th in the women's tour. 
 Made it to the semi-final in the French four years ago, but hasn't made much noise since. 
 She's Morozov's daughter? 
 Mistress. 
 Ooh. 
 Nadia's been giving us intel on Morozov for the past three years, but missed her two previous drops. 
 She's playing in the BMW D.C. Invitational this weekend, you're gonna meet her at practice, and follow protocol. 
 Auggie will take you through it. 
 You're going to the tennis center, main court. 
 We have a guy. 
 Nadia will be in the middle of her practice session. 
 You are a fan coming to meet your favorite player. 
 You'll have a bouquet of 13 roses-- 
 12 red, 1 white. 
 That indicates to her that you're her new handler. 
 Careful, there will be people around. 
 Nadia has a new coach. 
 Also, Morozov might be present... with protection. 
 These are for Miss Levandi. I'm a fan. 
 Don't worry. Nadia will allow you down to her. 
 You'll give the roses to Nadia. 
 If Nadia has intel, she'll ask to meet you later. 
 If Nadia doesn't have any intel, she will say, "Roses..." 
 Roses... 
 "My favorite." 
 My favorite. 
 "I will put them in a vase in my locker." 
 I'll put them in a vase in my hotel. 
 I mean, I'll put them in the locker room. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 Auggie... Nadia sent me a signal. 
 She botched the script. 
 I think she's in trouble. 
 Something was off. I know it. 
 She may have just spaced on the wording. 
 Here's what you need to know about assets, they're not trained operatives. 
 They are normal people who we see as targets of opportunity, and they screw up all the time. 
 They're late, they lose stuff, they ask for crazy things... 
 But don't we have a responsibility to help her if she's in trouble? 
 [Quietly] 
 Damn. 
 You played the morality card. 
 You know I did. 
 So help me. 
 All right, if Nadia's in imminent danger, we need proof to take to Joan. 
 Stay on your surveil and initiate the compromised asset protocol. 
 Make sure you do a head tail-- the van can't know you're following it if you're in front of it. 
 It's a risky maneuver but professional drivers always use their blinkers. 
 If you don't have the right gear to fit in, be resourceful. 
 Could you show me the locker rooms? 
 Oh, yeah, sure. 
 I'm thinking about joining. 
 The tricky thing will be getting her alone. 
 These players are always surrounded by their coaches and trainers. 
 [Water sizzling] 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 Isn't that thing gonna melt in here? 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's my vice. 
 I used to not be able to get good quality chocolate in my country. 
 But now that Estonia is in the euro, we get all the good candies. 
 Nadia, we need to talk. 
 Sorry I screwed up the flower protocol. 
 But it's very confusing, there were people watching. 
 Yeah. Morozov. 
 He do that to you? 
 I tripped going after a drop shot. 
 And your shoulder? 
 You have the wrong idea about Alo. 
 He's a good man. 
 I know you're worried. 
 I have a solution. You can come into Langley. 
 We can leave straight from here. 
 I have a car waiting outside. 
 Tell your CIA people to not bother me anymore. 
 Nadia, please. 
 Leave me alone. 
 This doesn't concern you. 
 Nadia is definitely in danger. 
 She's just too scared to admit it. 
 If I'm gonna authorize a protection team, I need a request from the asset. 
 Did she ask for help? 
 No, not exactly. 
 Not exactly, or no? 
 She asked for the CIA to leave her alone. 
 But how many long-term assets walk away from the arrangement? 
 Very few. A lot of people get cold feet and stop short before becoming assets. 
 Once they commit, they're in. 
 Giving up the protection and the money? 
 It doesn't happen. That's because she's scared. 
 Morozov has a long track record of killing the people who betray him. 
 All right. 
 Annie, you'll surveil with Auggie, and Holman on tech support. But keep a safe distance. 
 If Nadia really is in as much trouble as you think, then exposing her as a CIA asset is gonna make things much worse. 
 Here's to a moment of refuge in the eye of the storm. 
 [Glasses clink] 
 I will drink to that. 
 If we could bring these files out of the building, we could be enjoying this scotch at home. 
 If we could bring those files out of this building, you still would not be enjoying your scotch. 
 Can you read me in? 
 Oh, it's just in-house counsel. 
 Saying the team needs more time to get my Tanzania cables together. 
 That's the third time since they came onboard. 
 It's the way of lawyers. 
 Agency lawyers. 
 In-house counsel has a muddled agenda, at best. 
 What you need is someone who's solely on your side. 
 Hm. 
 Someone like Chet Legardie. 
 Chet Legardie? 
 He was good enough for the Speaker of the House. 
 He'll bankrupt us. 
 Then we can dip into our savings. 
 And then he'll win. 
 He always wins. 
 Just hiring Chet Legardie will imply that I'm guilty. 
 At every D.C. cocktail party from now on, people are gonna be whispering about you. 
 It's just a question whether they're whispering about you losing your job or keeping your job. 
 You said you wanted to fight. 
 This is how we fight. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, let's give in-house counsel a little more time. 
 Okay, Annie, the security office has authorized a sweep of your house. 
 But they need you to get your sister out of the house. 
 Think you can handle it? 
 I told them you could, so...help me out. 
 Beat you there. 
 I'm winning. 
 [Mouths] 
 One, two, three... 
 No! Ah! 
 [Spilling noise] 
 Ah! Chloe just single-handedly destroyed the carpet. 
 Oh! No, I'm sorry! 
 I must've given them too much. 
 I'll pay for the carpet cleaning. 
 No, you don't have to. That's the price of having kids. 
 No, I insist. 
 [Phone rings] 
 I'll have the cleaners here tomorrow. 
 Annie Walker. Our girl is on the move. 
 I'll be right there. 
 I, unfortunately, have to miss dinner. 
 Oh, shocker. 
 They're leaving F street. 
 They just pulled up to an alley. 
 He's pulling her out of the car and she doesn't look happy. 
 Holman, can you give us ears? 
 These microphones are parabolic extrapolators. 
 They actually send data in real time. 
 And fill in any gaps across the arc from the other mics in the circuit. 
 Holman, if you wanna impress a woman, compliment her. 
 Don't talk about your own equipment. 
 Especially when your own equipment has circuitry. 
 I just think it's all so cool. 
 He's taking her inside the building. 
 Jerry, can you get us closer? 
 Annie, I don't think that's a good idea. 
 We gotta keep our distance. 
 If we expose ourselves and blow our cover, we put her life at risk. 
 I know, I get it. 
 Holman, where are we? 
 Frequency coming in now. 
 [Static noise, loud bang] 
 That sounds like gunfire. 
 Annie, think this through. 
 If she's in danger, I'm not just gonna sit here. 
 [popping noise] 
 
 
 
 [Swanky jazz music plays] 
 To the beautiful and beguiling Nadia. 
 My Nadia, so magnificent on the court. 
 Happy Birthday. 
 All : Happy Birthday! 
 Annie, I'm shutting down Nadia as an asset. 
 Last night's near-miss nearly outed her and you to Morozov. 
 But Nadia's still in danger. 
 We know what Morozov is capable of. 
 If that's the case, then it's in her best interests to have no further contact with the CIA. 
 So we're done with her? Just like that? 
 Just like that. Precisely. 
 These newspapers are your next assignment. 
 You're gonna go through back issues of the  Montreal Gazette  to find any increased citations regarding Quebecois secession. 
 Are you-- 
 Serious? 
 Totally. 
 This has got to be heavily redacted. 
 There's just too much disclosure. 
 Jai! 
 It's good to see you. 
 It's good to see anyone without a law degree. 
 Did I catch you at a bad time? 
 Not bad, just... Sort of busy. 
 All right, I'll be quick. 
 Ben Mercer's back in town. 
 What's the play? What do you want me to do? 
 Stay with Joan, work in the D.P.D. 
 This was supposed to be temporary. 
 Things have changed. 
 Things are changing. I like you, Jai. 
 But the best thing for you right now might be to get some distance from me. 
 That's funny. 
 Someone else gave me the exact same advice. 
 Someone might be looking out for you. 
 Hi, I'm Louis, from In-Extremis Carpet Cleaners. 
 Your sister hired us. 
 Oh, yeah. Wow, you guys sure are prompt. 
 Yeah, you know, it's--it's not really that big a spill. 
 It's not the size of the spill, it's the depth and viscosity of the radial blot. 
 Do my kids and I have to leave the house? 
 You're welcome to stay. 
 You may get a little light-headed. 
 I think we'll go. 
 Chloe! Katia! 
 We're in. 
 Commencing sweep. 
 [Camera clicks] 
 [Camera clicks] 
 [Camera clicks] 
 [Camera clicks] 
 Auggie, I found you. 
 Don't interrupt me, I'll lose my count. 
 4,005, 4,006... 
 Have we drilled down on Morozov? 
 He's been at Nadia's practice session for the second consecutive day. 
 He's watching her like a hawk. 
 Wait, you're staking out Nadia even after Joan told you to drop it? 
 Okay, yeah. I have. 
 That's a pretty huge breach of protocol. 
 But I know something is going on. 
 It's like the O'Neal affair in 1962, when that violinist from the New York Philharmonic was murdered in Moscow. 
 Annie, listen to yourself. 
 You've been through a lot the past few weeks-- with Sri Lanka, with Guam, with Ben... 
 I'm worried it's making you paranoid. 
 No. 
 Maybe. 
 Look, in our line of work, there is a very thin line between intuition and paranoia. 
 Our job is to walk right up to that line. 
 But never to cross it. 
 I'm worried about you, as an operative and a friend. 
 I'm fine. 
 You will be. 
 And you may not wanna hear this, but Holman's sweep of your apartment came back clean. 
 The break-in was probably just a couple of kids. 
 Oh. 
 Why don't you take the rest of the day off? 
 I'll cover it with Joan. 
 Thanks, Auggie. 
 Comfort food! 
 [Bag crinkles] 
 [Giggles] 
 We both need-- 
 Excuse me. 
 Where did they move Ben Mercer? 
 Who? 
 Ben Mercer. Room 202. 
 [Typing] 
 Sorry. 
 There's no one here under that name. 
 He was here. 
 There's no record of anyone by that name ever staying here. 
 [Loud clanging] 
 Annie? 
 I know I'm probably breaking CIA regulations by coming to your house, and this is over the line on about nine other levels, but I literally didn't know who else to talk to. 
 What's going on? 
 Do you know what happened to Ben? 
 I need to know. 
 I understand that this is hard for you. 
 And...What I think will make it a little easier is for you to separate out your feelings for Ben and think of him as an asset. 
 Ben would represent a high-risk, high-reward individual. 
 Does that make sense? 
 I think so. 
 So on a human level, what that means is that as exhilarating as your time is with Ben, when he goes missing or does something duplicitous, you have to accept that. 
 There are always going to be questions with Ben. 
 I'm beginning to see that. 
 And in answer to your original question, I think you're a strong enough operative now to intuit my response. 
 Well, the fact that you didn't directly answer my question means that you know where he is. 
 And the fact that you're not yelling at me, means he's probably safe. 
 See you at the office, Annie. 
 I just don't get it. Why did they move Ben? 
 I don't know. 
 We work in a job with a lot of "I don't knows." 
 Did your team find out anything about Guam? 
 We did. 
 The would-be assassins were a Belgian and a Fin who never worked together before. What does that mean? 
 What's the linkage between the two? 
 Well, the linkage is Ben. 
 Someone wanted him dead, and they hired the two perfect people to do it. 
 The Belgian's an expert in military security systems, the Fin is a weapons specialist. 
 Together, they had skills and access. 
 Other than that, there's no profile. 
 Access. 
 We gotta go. 
 What? Really? 
 I don't get to finish my beer? 
 You really don't. 
 Let's go. 
 [Applause] 
 Okay, can you hold this? 
 [Horn honking] 
 Ooh. 
 Okay, I can't see the speedometer, but I'm gonna ask you to slow down. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Jai, it's Annie. 
 I just emailed you some photos. 
 Can you run them through the facial recognition database? 
 Sure, give me a minute. 
 You're looping in Jai? 
 Now I really wish we'd stayed at the bar. 
 I was wrong about Nadia. 
 Yes, I know. I told you that. 
 No, someone's in danger, but it's not Nadia. 
 It's Morozov. 
 Nadia's the assassin. 
 You were right, it's all about access. 
 And Nadia can get to Morozov without raising eyebrows. 
 Why now? 
 Nadia is Morozov's mistress, she's been close to him for three years. 
 She could've done it at any time. 
 Because now Nadia can buy good chocolate in Estonia. 
 See, you were starting to make sense. 
 And now you're making less sense. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Estonia just pegged to the euro. 
 It's opening up opportunities for foreign investment. 
 Morozov probably knows that he could make a mint off his land holdings if he wasn't tied to Russia. 
 And that's what he's doing here. 
 [Sighs] 
 I should've realized it before. 
 He's using Nadia's practices as a place to talk to potential bidders. 
 Going against the Kremlin would be a suicide mission. 
 Yeah, and Morozov knows that. 
 Hey. 
 That was fast. 
 That's 'cause I don't need to run this through the database. 
 The man in one of the photos is Peter Kuyt. 
 A known South African mining magnate. 
 Peter Kuyt? 
 Thanks. 
 Peter Kuyt's no friend of the Kremlin. 
 Morozov is double dealing and Nadia's caught in the middle. 
 I need to talk to Nadia. 
 You got a plan? 
 We have a plan. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Applause] 
 Thank you. 
 Um, A-5. 
 This is my seat. 
 Nope, that's my seat. 
 The match is almost over. 
 Traffic was a bear. 
 At least that's what my driver told me. 
 You are blind. 
 So? 
 I still deserve a seat. I do enjoy tennis. 
 Maybe not the same way-- 
 I didn't-- 
 Didn't what? 
 Didn't mean to steal the blind man's seat? 
 Or care-- hey, get your hands off of me. 
 Look, just look at my ticket, man. 
 Let me see. 
 Let's go figure this out together. 
 I'll walk you up to the ticket booth. 
 Okay. 
 Don't look back. Walk quickly but calmly. 
 Hello! 
 Area's off-limits. 
 Yeah, I'm Nadia Levandi's personal concierge. 
 She hasn't finished yet, has she? 
 Just, uh... 
 Drop it. 
 Nadia wanted an apple to help her blood sugar after the match. 
 She got mad because I got her a fuji, and she only eats honeycrisps. 
 So I had to go out and get her this. 
 [Whispers] 
 I don't wanna get fired. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Hey, Nadia... 
 You need to come with me. 
 I told you to leave me alone. 
 Alo's safe. He's in our custody. 
 No. They'll kill me. 
 That's why you need to come with me. 
 The CIA can protect you. 
 Thank you. 
 Nadia! 
 [Gunfire] 
 So I take it your coach is F.S.B.? 
 She threatened me, I had no choice. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Which way's the front entrance? 
 The front? 
 Yeah. 
 We'll be totally exposed. 
 Trust me. 
 It's that way. 
 [Gunfire] 
 How did you know the engine would be on? 
 I didn't. Some of this is improvised. 
 Hold on. 
 [Wheels screech] 
 [Gunfire] 
 Oh, my God! 
 Stay down. 
 [Gunfire, glass shatters] 
 [Horn honking] 
 [Yelling in Estonian] 
 You have some mouth on you. 
 You speak Estonian? 
 Just the swear words. 
 [Tires screech, horn honking] 
 Where are you going? 
 I have a plan. 
 Here we go. 
 Hold on. 
 [Loud knocking] 
 Chet Legardie? 
 In the three-piece-clad flesh. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What am I doing here? 
 Your husband hired me. Apparently at your suggestion? 
 So I suggest we go inside and start working on his legal defense, because this conversation is on the clock, and my clock isn't cheap. 
 Come on in. 
 Your lawyer's here. 
 Just show me the chair, please. 
 Great, thank you. 
 Hi. I'm Joe Jacobi, of Jacobi and Theisman. 
 So...Give me the straight scoop, I'll do my best to get you off. 
 If you lie to me, and I'll know you're lying... 
 I'll let you hang, okay? 
 I can't tell, are you nodding? 
 Yes. 
 So you kids are just getting your thrills stealing bikes, loose cash, that sort of thing? 
 Again with the nodding. Yes. 
 Did you break into the garage of 4141 P Street? 
 Answer me, please. 
 Yes. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Good. I'll see what I can do. 
 Good afternoon, gentlemen. Officer. 
 Was that guy really our lawyer? 
 Unfortunately, I have some bad news. 
 The CIA can offer you asylum and protection in the U.S., but nothing further. 
 No more money... A life of anonymity. 
 I'll never play professional tennis again. 
 No. 
 Being in public is too great of a risk. 
 We've already pulled you from this tournament due to a sudden hamstring injury. 
 At least I can eat my chocolate bars now without the fear of recrimination. 
 And you went out with a win. 
 I know this whole thing is terrible. 
 But this is your life now, and you're gonna need to accept it. 
 Thank you. 
 For what? 
 For not trying to make me happier than I should be. 
 Americans are always trying to change things. 
 But Estonian heart is black. 
 We know when fate has turned on us. 
 So what do you do? 
 You live. 
 It's still living. 
 I don't wanna just live. I want more than that. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're truly not Estonian. 
 No. I guess I'm not. 
 Good luck, Nadia. 
 [Car door opens] 
 I love this view. 
 It always seems like you're closer to the capitol than you really are. It's a matter of perspective. 
 Were you followed? 
 Trust me. 
 With all I got going on in my life, I took no chances. 
 Welcome back to the agency, Mr. Mercer. 
 I must say, while you were away, I admired your work. You helped us. 
 You helped me out a lot of dicey situations. 
 How would you like to continue to do that? 
 But this time, with agency resources. 
 Full autonomy. Off the books. 
 One condition. 
 What is it? 
 I wanna talk to Annie. 
 You know that's not possible. 
 There's a reason why you haven't contacted her in two years. 
 She's a security risk to someone like you. 
 And you for her. 
 I need to see her. 
 Hm. 
 How about this... 
 Stay in your lane, complete your missions, and I'll see if we can't find a way to bring you back in. 
 Typical agency carrot-and-stick behavior. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Good talk. 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Hey. You need me to come in? 
 Easy there, worker bee. 
 I'm just calling to check in and see how you're holding up. 
 I've been better. 
 Do you wanna meet me at the tavern? 
 [Walking stick clicking] 
 Sure. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Am I gonna get to finish my beer this time? 
 Not only that... I'm buying.
