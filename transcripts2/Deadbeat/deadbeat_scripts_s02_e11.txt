 Ah! 
 Ow, God! Hi! Hey Tyson. 
 You can't go to the newsstand anymore. 
 I... I just wanted to go there and grab a couple snacks. 
 You know, get away from Sue. 
 We had kind of a rough night. 
 Roofie's been arrested! 
 Okay you can let go now, Tyson. 
 I can't! 
 My knuckles are caught in your braided bitch belt! 
 Just let go! It's like a... it's like a raccoon trap.

 I got intel for the precinct! 
 That old fucker was like one foot in the grave. 
 His breath smelled like dead flowers! 
 Look, we got a bigger problem, all right? 
 All my product was confiscated. 
 All of it. 
 Even the special strain I was saving called Sue's finger. 
 You named a special strain of weed after Sue's finger? 
 You thoughtful devil, you. 
 Listen, your dead girlfriend's finger is in a weed box in the evidence room! 
 Okay well, lucky for us, I am a master improvoseur. 
 You're not.

 Nope! I'm not that either.

 Hands on your head, asshole! 
 Okay look, look. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 This is just a big misunderstanding, okay? 
 Haven't you ever made a mistake? 
 As a matter of fact, I have. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, you're a ghost. 
 Hey look, I can get in a lot of trouble here. 
 This is not the time or the place for a big, elaborate backstory. 
 The year was 1989. 
 I was hot on the trail of the most dangerous psychopath this city's ever seen. 
 A serial killer? 
 A serial flasher. 
 Oh. 
 Needless to say, the guy left a bad taste in my mouth. 
 And you guys never caught him? 
 We thought we did. 
 My partner Frank and I were working around the clock. 
 After months of dead ends, we landed on the doorstep of a man named Johnny pen1s. 
 ('80s synthesizer music) 
 Wait, wait. Months? 
 I would think with a name like pen1s he would have been a suspect immediately. 
 Don't interrupt a flashback, man! 
 It's f*cking rude! 
 Yeah, I'm sorry, I hate that.

 I kicked in the door on a hunch. 
 Freeze, asshole! 
 Oh, woah! 
 Take it easy, fellas. 
 Don't move a muscle! 
 I just gotta tighten my robe. 
 I said f*cking freeze! 
 You... watch the language, fella! 
 We got kids here! 
 Keep those hands where we can see 'em. 
 You got me just right out of the shower, let...

 That is, until it started back up. 
 The flashing? 
 Not just the flashing. 
 The photos. 
 The sick b*st*rd used to take Polaroids of his victims' reactions. 
 No! 
 Yeah. 
 Frank wrote it off as a copycock. 
 But something about it rubbed me off wrong. 
 Did we catch the right guy? 
 Unfortunately, I died before I could ever be sure. 
 Okay, I get it, I get it.

 Forget it, asshole, I only work alone. 
 What? What about Frank? 
 Fine. I just said that because I don't want... 
 ... to work with you. 
 Hey, like it or not, you need a living person to solve this case, and I'm the only one who can see you. 
 All right? And I need a ghost to help me get my girlfriend's finger out of this evidence room, and you're the only one who can get me in there. 
 So it looks like we might be stuck together, partner. 
 All right. 
 I got two rules, asshole. 
 Hold, wait a minute. 
 That's not, like, my new nickname, is it? 
 First, don't call me partner. 
 Okay, got it. 
 And second, don't you dare embarrass me. 
 I would never.

 I'm a medium, and I'm here with the ghost of your ex-partner Max. 
 Max? 
 Yeah, he's right here. 
 You got one minute. 
 Okay, that's all we need. 
 We want to bust an old case wide open. 
 What case? 
 The Polaroid flasher. 
 The Polaroid flasher. 
 Jesus Christ, Max! 
 You just can't let that thing go, can you? 
 We caught the guy! 
 We didn't find one Polaroid on Johnny pen1s. 
 And remind him there's been new victims. 
 Max wants me to remind you there's been new victims. 
 No, there's been copycocks. 
 Yeah, but they... 
 All right? 
 None of these new victims could pick a pen1s out of the lineup. 
 None of them! 
 Wait. 
 You guys actually did that? 
 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, stripper cop. 
 Hey, I'm just tryin' to help with Max, man. 
 You know, we're jamming! 
 Max is dead. 
 Okay? And this case is closed. 
 Now you can take your booty cheeks and clap them together somewhere else. 
 I'm sorry. I feel like I really let you down up there, Max. 
 26th West 30th Street. 
 What's that? A good s'mizza place? 
 It's the address of the last victim. 
 I saw it in the file before Frank humiliated you with that booty clap comment.

 He's a smart fucker, I'll give him that.

 Veins? 
 A few, on the side.

 No! 
 I didn't want you to cry! 
 Aw, come... was that really necessary? 
 Mid-thigh. 
 What? 
 That testicular drooping is as consistent with a man in his mid-fifties. 
 The exact age the Polaroid flasher would be if he were alive today. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Are we hot on the trail of something? 
 Unfortunately, we're fresh out of leads. 
 Aw, f*ck it. 
 We've got nothing but droopy balls and a camera owned by every family in the city. 
 What, uh, the Polaroid? 
 No, no, no, nobody uses the Polaroid anymore. 
 But he's still buying film. How? 
 On the internet, probably? 
 The what? 
 Right, there was no internet back then! 
 And a man in his fifties might wanna do things the old fashioned way. 
 There's only one place in town I know that still sells Polaroid film. 
 Right next to my favorite s'mizza parlor.
