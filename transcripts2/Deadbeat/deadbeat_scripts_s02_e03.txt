 ♪ 
 Why do blind people walk their dogs so much? 
 Is this really what you called me for? 
 No. No, I'm sorry. 
 It was just the first thing that popped into my head when you picked up. 
 I'm calling because, uh, I'm being blackmailed. 
 Blackmailed by Camomile White to help her with her stupid reality TV show. 
 Oh, is she tryin' to use you to talk to ghosts? 
 Well, no. She's using me to keep ghosts away, so she can pretend to talk to ghosts. 
 What... what do I do? 
 Tell that skinny bitch no! 
 No, no. I'm afraid not, Roofie. 
 In this situation that is literally the worst N-word I could use. 
 It's not. It's not. 
 It is. Trust me. 
 Oh, yo, what does she have on you? 
 Oh, well, that's... that's sort of where it gets interesting. 
 I, uh, kinda sorta accidentally told her that I kept Sue from walking into her light. 
 And it wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't sorta kinda done it in front of her video camera? 
 Look, here's what you do, okay? 
 Come clean, all right? 
 Tell Sue the truth, and Camomile has nothing on you. 
 Ooh, the truth is some risky business, Roofie. 
 Dude, if she loves you, she'll forgive you man. 
 If she really wants to be with you, you'll be fine. 
 Look, Roofie. There are a few good men out there, okay, and I'm just tryin' to make all the right moves, but if I go into this thing with my eyes wide shut, the whole thing could literally fall into oblivion. 
 Are you even listening to me? 
 Or are you just listing Tom Cruise movies? 
 Who's Tom Cruise? 
 Look. Just be honest with Sue, okay? 
 The difference in your relationship... 
 -... will be like... 
 Knight and Day. 
 Classic Cameron Diaz tale of love. 
 I like it. I like where your head's at, Roofie! 
 No more lies. It's over. 
 No. You did it again, man! 
 Are you listening... 
 m*therf*cker. 
 Okay! 
 I'm off to work. 
 And that's the truth! 
 I had a really nice time on our date the other night. 
 Yeah, me too! I'm... I'm being super honest right now. 
 Hey! I was thinking maybe I could stop by the newsstand today? Keep you company? 
 I don't know. I don't... nah. 
 I don't think it's a good idea. 
 I mean, I got, like, so much stuff to do. 
 I am... I'm snowed in. 
 I got so much paperwork. 
 My desk is buried in paperwork. 
 There's a desk at the newsstand? 
 Yeah. You'd... you'd never know, right? 
 Okay. Then I guess I'll just stay here. 
 All day. 
 By myself. 
 I don't want you to stay here by yourself all day. 
 Why don't... why don't you go chop it up, make some ghost friends out there? 
 What? Just go out in the world and make friends? 
 Yeah! It's easy, walk up to someone and say, "Hey. How'd you die?" 
 You were murdered then raped? 
 That doesn't happen very often. 
 My name's Sue. 
 "What's up?" 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah. 
 Just tell me about it later. 
 Okay? Tonight. 
 Not... not today. 
 Because obviously I'm gonna be at work at the... at the newsstand. 
 At my desk all day. 
 Oh, okay. 
 That's where I work. 
 Okay, bye!

 Oh, don't worry! It'll wear off after a decade or so! 
 How long have you been a ghost? 
 Oh, I died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, way back in 1911. 
 And I died on my period, so feels like twice as long. 
 Oh. What's your unfinished business?

 Because they're kinda shooting a little TV show downstairs in your living room, and, uh, your ghost energy or whatever is sort of messing with the sound equipment. 
 Oh, okay, sure. 
 I'll just leave my own room so that my parents can do their thing. 
 Yeah! That's gr... Thank you. 
 I thought for a minute you were gonna give me a hard time.

 This Sarah girl is kind of a bitch. 
 Major unresolved issues with her mom and dad, okay, so if we're going to sort out her unfinished business, we need to sit down with the parents, drown ourselves in Fig Newtons, obviously... 
 We don't have time for that! 
 Okay, well, then how am I supposed to get her to go into her light? 
 I don't care if she goes off into the light or into the red wrath of the devil's asshole. 
 Just get her out of here now! 
 All right. Fine.

 How long has it been? 
 Since I was alive. 
 Ghosts can't smoke weed, stupid.

 Who is it? 
 Pac. 
 What's up? 
 Roofie, you gotta help me. 
 I'm with the ghost of a teenage girl. 
 How old is she? 
 What? I don't know. 
 She looks 15. 
 Uh, no. 
 I'm not interested. 
 What? 
 Is she Puerto Rican? 
 I don't know. 
 What's the ass on the situation? 
 I don't know what the ass situation is. 
 Listen, she was messing with Camomile's set, and I had to bribe her to get her out of there. 
 I told her that you had, like, a strain of weed that could get ghosts high. 
 Pac, I thought you was done lying? 
 I am! I didn't... you know, I'm not gonna go cold turkey. 
 I have to, like, wiener myself off. 
 So how the hell am I supposed to help with this? 
 
 
 
 Hey! 
 Is there a problem? 
 What? No! No, no. 
 Good. We're super good. 
 You just chill. I'm screwed. 
 So, what, you told her that ghosts can get high, and she believed you? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, I can work with that! 
 You can? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Come on in. 
 Just one second. 
 Come on. 
 Have I ever told you about the first drug I've ever sold? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Look, in 7th grade I made a killin' off oregano. 
 You can get high smoking oregano? 
 Nah, man! 
 But those stupid ass kids believed that they were high. 
 Ohhh, oh. 
 Paid for the platinum rims on my ten-speed. 
 And this dead plant is the answer to all your problems. 
 Oh, hells yeah. 
 I love it, Roof. Okay. 
 But then right after we should probably figure out the whole Sarah thing. 
 What strain of weed is that? 
 Dead dog sh1t? 
 Um, she would like to know more about the product. 
 Oh! No problem. 
 This plant died before its leaves was fully grown, which is not much of a smoking experience for the average cannabis consumer. 
 But if you're dead, and there's a dead plant... check this out. 
 You take a piece, light these two dead leaves on fire... 
 Observe. 
 Mm-hm. 
 There's dough for getting ghosts blazed. 
 I call it my "Frowny Face."

 Oh, she's feeling it all right. 
 Look at her!

 Fifty?

 No, you can't! No, you can't... you can't head home. 
 Why not?
