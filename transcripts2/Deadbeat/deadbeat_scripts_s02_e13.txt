 Just kidding. 
 Oh my God. 
 You're probably all like, 
 "What the bloody hell is going on here, then?" 
 (laughing) 
 I don't know. 
 Can't do a British accent. 
 Anyway, you've been getting pretty messed up on these bad boys, which made it easy-breezy for me to possess you so we could talk. 
 Oh, I'm Millie. I'm a ghost. 
 I probably should have led with that. 
 Anyway, remember that whole Samantha Cherry thing?

 It's a super cute piñata, Zoila! 
 Can't wait to see what's inside! 
 I hate that piñata. I wanna lose it. 
 What do you think? 
 Kevin, do you think... 
 ... you're maybe going a little bit overboard with this whole thing? 
 Well, how do you figure? 
 You can't afford all this. 
 Okay. You know what? 
 Roofie's getting out of the clink today. 
 He's probably gonna be super sad, having to say goodbye to all of his new prison buddies. 
 I just wanna remind him, he's got friends on the outside, too. Okay? 
 Plus I saved all the receipts, I'm hoping he'll reimburse me. 
 So... (knocking) 
 Oh, sh1t! Oh, he's here! 
 He's here! Hide! 
 Everyone f*cking hide. 
 Well, not, not you. 
 Huh? 
 Not you. 
 Zoila, you, hide! 
 Hi! 
 Eh... oh, Goddamn it, Zoila. 
 Learn English! 
 All right, here we go. 
 Hey... 
 Kevin Pacaliaglu? 
 Oglu. Yes. 
 I'm with US Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
 You're being investigated for marriage fraud. 
 ♪ 
 You and Zoila are frickin' married? 
 Is this all really necessary? 
 I'm afraid so. 
 We received an anonymous tip, which may or may not be completely unreliable. 
 So as you can imagine, we're taking this matter very seriously. 
 Oh my God. 
 Did you just marry Zoila to get Glen out of the picture? 
 Out of curiosity, just how seriously are we taking this matter? 
 If I deem the marriage to be a fraud, Mrs. Pacalioglu would be deported and you would spend a minimum of five years in prison. 
 Well, would you look at that, honey? 
 There's hope for me yet. 
 (nervous laughter) 
 I can assure you, sir, this is nothing to joke about. 
 And even if it were, I have a terrible sense of humor. 
 Okay, well I can assure you, sir, that we are very much a real couple, and we are very much in love. 
 Actually, today is the tenth anniversary of the night we first met. 
 Hence the, uh, the party! 
 Every year we recreate that, uh, beautiful drunken night when we first met and fell in love. 
 It's actually a pretty funny story. 
 It's a humorless true story based in fact, actually. 
 Uh, you see, Zoila was working for this woman at the time. 
 A huge B-I-T-C-H, pardon my French, but it's true. 
 And, uh, that same woman just so happened to be my biggest business rival, so you could say we had a mutual enemy. 
 Uh, so we bumped into each other at this bar one night, and uh, after we shared a few laughs, and some drinks, and some guffaws, and secrets, it didn't take us long to realize that we, uh, we shared something pretty special. 
 Mhm. 
 And how does the 'Free Roofie' poster fit in? 
 ♪ 
 Oh, that. Yeah. 
 Uh, I believe at the time I was volunteering for an organization that handed out free roofies. 
 You handed out free roofies? 
 Yes. To women. 
 Exclusively to women. 
 You see, the idea was that we helped them build up a tolerance to the drug, and that way they can avoid the risk of being date raped. 
 I guess that makes sense. 
 Yeah. 
 So Mrs. Pacalioglu, how did this night begin? 
 Oh, it's actually really an important part of the tradition that we recreate that night exactly as it happened ten years ago, back when Zoila didn't speak a lick of English, did ya? 
 Never liked English that much, did ya? 
 But the night started with two shots of tequila. 
 I guess that also makes sense. 
 All right, well, I'm willing to let this thing play out. 
 Okay! Good man. 
 All right. 
 Kevin, I had no idea you were such a good liar! 
 Okay. 
 Uh, I'm not gonna get in trouble for any of the drugs, right? 
 That's not my jurisdiction. 
 I didn't think so. Okay! 
 To free roofies! 
 Salud! 
 ♪ 
 Welcome home, you f*ckin' rat. 
 That's a little sexy face. 
 Zoila, sexy, damn it. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Yeah, that's how it all went down in ye old photo booth. You know? 
 That's like, that's how it happened. 
 We asked each other to be each other's assistants and, uh, that's pretty much, uh, that's pretty much it, you know? 
 Well, I have to say, if I had a romantic bone in my body, I'd be deeply moved right now. 
 Perhaps more moved than I've ever been in my entire life. 
 But alas, I do not. 
 Which leads me to my last and most logical question. 
 If indeed you and Mrs. Pacalioglu have been living together for ten years, certainly she'd speak some English by now. 
 Correct? 
 Certainly. 
 So, do you speak English? 
 ♪ 
 It's okay, you can talk to me.

 All right, seriously, I've got, like, 
 40 more of these to go today.

 Psych! 
 Of course I speak English. 
 (chuckling) 
 Okay, now that is what I would imagine is an A+ joke. Good one. 
 All right, I'm convinced. 
 Happy anniversary! 
 Thank you very much. 
 All right, get the heck out of here. 
 There you go. There's your jacket. 
 Sorry to run, I'm a little emotional. 
 Oh yeah, I understand. I understand. 
 We're all getting caught up in the moment. 
 Oh my God, Sue! 
 That was amazing. 
 I know. 
 Oh, here, here, here! 
 Here. To us.

 Oh.

 Sue? Sue?

 Sue, are you in there? 
 Sue, can you hear me? 
 Say something. Sue? 
 Hey, Sue! 
 Kevin, I can hear you! 
 I'm trapped in some kind of... 
 ♪ 
 I think I'm in a giant piñata! 
 Sue! 
 Well! 
 Your wife is one very lucky lady. 
 Oh, is she gonna be okay? 
 Oh, I have no idea. 
 I'm a doctor, not a psychic. 
 I just meant she's lucky to have a private room. We're slammed today. 
 Okay, great, awesome. 
What's wrong with her? 
 Her cirrhosis of the liver was exacerbated by a sudden influx of alcohol. 
 If she doesn't receive a new liver soon, she'll probably die. 
 Well, how the hell do I get her that? 
 We actually had a delivery of livers this morning. 
 But someone didn't close the fridge all the way, so they all went bad! 
 Now you could always donate half of yours. 
 Does that mean that I would have to... 
 ... stop drinking? 
 Oh, definitely. 
 I'm gonna need a second opinion on this. 
 Doctor, is there anything else that we can do? 
 I'm afraid Doctor Wong is right. 
 Transplant is the only way. 
 All right, well, here's the thing. 
 I don't need Zoila to live, okay? 
 I mean, I don't want her to die or anything, but I don't need her to live. 
 You understand what I'm saying? 
 I see. 
 You are transferring your anger toward your absent mother. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I don't even have a mother. 
 Who are you again? 
 Dr. Sigmund Freud. 
 Oh my God. Woah! 
 How did you die? 
 I slipped. 
 (laughing) 
 Kidding! 
 Ha! 
 Cancer of the jaw. 
 Kevin, hurry! 
 The candy's rising! 
 It's all off-brand and mostly in Spanish. 
 Please, it's getting pretty loco in here! 
 I don't think you understand. 
 See, my ghost girlfriend is trapped inside her subconscious. 
 There's gotta be some other way to get her out! 
 Unfortunately this is always the big risk with possession. 
 Okay. 
 If the host... 
 ... goes into a coma, the ghost inside will be trapped there. 
 Yeah, yeah I got that already. 
 If the host dies, the ghost inside will be trapped forever. 
 Forever? 
 Forever ever. 
 Okay, I'll do it. 
 I'll go halfsies on my liver.

 Hey, slut! 
 Yeah, it's me again. 
 So first off, I think you might have a pretty serious drug problem. 
 But the good news is that now I can deliver to you the bad news! 
 The plan failed. 
 Somehow Pac and Zoila managed to convince the immigration dude that they were a legit couple!

 And the crazy thing is Sue, his freaking girlfriend, wasn't even mad that he had a secret wife!

 The bad news is, your liver is in horrible shape. 
 Way worse than Zoila's actually. 
 In fact, she'd die a lot faster if we go through with the transplant.

 Girlfriend.
