  A cicada? 
  An amazing little creature.

  They burrow underground just beneath the surface for years at a time and wait. 
  And then they awaken from their long slumber. 
  And die. 
  Yes but not before they fulfill their destiny. 
  You will be a great soldier for our cause. 
  But right now you need your rest.

  Are you seeing what I'm seeing? 
  Okay. 
  Tell Levine I'll be in the situation room in two minutes. 
  We've just received an incoming message from General Chin-Hwa Kwon of the North Korean People's Army. 
  He's in London with a delegation, and he's requested to speak to a woman named Tara Coleman. 
  Now, this request is completely unprecedented given Kwon's position, so I need to know everything about this woman, Tara Coleman. 
  She's a journalist. 
  Used to be a journalist. 
  She's currently a London cab driver. 
  We've got Matt Edwards on the ground, he's in London. 
  [OMINOUS RHYTHMIC MUSIC] 
  - I'm moving. 
  - 60 seconds out. 
  What's her background? 
  Raised in London, both parents and her sister killed in a car accident when she was 10. 
  She was also in the vehicle. 
  She was the lone survivor. 
  None of which explains why Tara Coleman is the woman of the hour. 
  This might have something to do with an article that she was working on a few years ago. 
  Headline? 
  Soviet era nuke currently aimed at Washington, D. C. 
  She believes that a decommissioned nuke known as Stiletto Six ended up on the black market. 
  This was full of holes; she lost all credibility. 
  Editor pulled the plug on it, fired her, and she has not published a word since. 
  Was she right about a nuke being aimed at D. C. ? 
  No, not as far as the Agency's concerned. 
  Well, that's not exactly reassuring. 
  Five seconds out. 
  Why is potentially the most valuable defector in North Korean history asking to speak to a discredited journalist turned cab driver? 
  I don't know. 
  Ask her yourself. 
  - Matt Edwards? 
  - Yeah. 
  Marriott County Hall. 
  [AFROBEAT MUSIC PLAYS] 
  Okay. 
  Traffic cam at A301 and Strand She's headed south towards Westminster Bridge. 
  I like Fela Kuti, too. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You're into Nigerian music? 
  Yeah, I spent some time there. 
  Oh, my sister got me into it. 
  Yeah? 
  Is that her? 
  Yeah. 
  You two close? 
  She's my best friend. 
  Oh, uh, take Belvedere Road. 
  Uh, we'll get stuck in traffic. 
  Well, I could use the extra time to talk to you about something. 
  I'm here right now because there's a North Korean general in London. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Man, you seemed so normal a minute ago. 
  The general will only talk to you. 
  This is a joke, right? 
  He wants to meet you in an hour. 
  I figured he might want to ask you about Stiletto Six. 
  Who are you? 
  This isn't a joke, Tara. 
  Answer my question. 
  I work for the U. 
  S. 
  State Department. 
  You mean the CIA. 
  I have her. 
  They're still heading south. 
  Get me a photo on that bridge. 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  Why me? 
  Maybe he's got a story. 
  You're a journalist. 
  If you knew how to find me then you know I'm not a journalist anymore. 
  I know your history. 
  Help us out with General Kwon, and I can help you get your reputation back. 
  I just need ten minutes. 
  Are you in? 
  Operation's a go, let's move! 
  It's an amplified mic. 
  We'll have ears but not eyes on you. 
  Am I going in alone? 
  Kwon said he'd walk if he saw anyone else. 
  I'll be with my team right outside the building. 
  And one of General Kwon's associates will be waiting for you in the lobby. 
  He'll bring you to the meet. 
  Good luck. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  [SLIDE CLICKS] 
  Clear copy, repeat, clear copy. 
  General Kwon has exited the ballroom. 
  Tara's leaving the second floor elevator right now heading for the men's room on the east end of the building. 
  [MUSIC FADES] 
  General Kwon? 
  [SUSPENSEFUL NOTES] 
  Thank you for coming. 
  What's this about? 
  You can't trust the CIA. 
  They're waking them up. 
  Waking who up? 
  The cicadas. 
  It's starting again. 
  What's starting again? 
  Treadstone. 
  [DISSONANT EERIE NOTES] 
  What's Treadstone? 
  [STATIC BLASTS] 
  I've lost audio. 
  SAD unit, prepare to make entry. 
  Audio down. 
  Repeat, prepare to make entry. 
  Stand down. 
  Stand down, just let this play out. 
  [POUNDS DOOR] 
  What the hell is Treadstone? 
  I was sending a message. 
  We don't have much time. 
  What the f*ck, Dan? 
  Treadstone? 
  Clear the room. 
  Please, everybody out. 
  In less than a minute, SAD will reach the building. 
  Then tell me what I'm doing here. 
  A rogue group in North Korea has raised funds to purchase the Stiletto Six launch codes from a Russian man named Yuri Leniov. 
  They're looking to upset the balance of power. 
  I need you to acquire the launch codes before they do. 
  How am I supposed to do that? 
  I have a daughter who attends boarding school in France. 
  Her name is Jang-Mi. 
  Bring her to the Ecuadorian Embassy in Paris. 
  The ambassador is expecting you. 
  He will give you what you need. 
  I need to think this through. 
  My enemies already suspect me. 
  They have targeted me and my daughter. 
  You have to find her immediately, Tara. 
  Why can't you do anything about it? 
  [EERIE NOTES] 
  I won't live long enough. 
  Look Give her this. 
  Tell my daughter I love her. 
  Why are you trusting me with this? 
  Because of your single-minded pursuit of Stiletto Six. 
  You lost your career as a journalist because you weren't willing to back down from your instincts about it. 
  You also know what it's like to lose your family. 
  [MELANCHOLY NOTES] 
  Please. 
  Help me save mine. 
  What did Kwon mean by cicadas? 
  Ellen Why the hell was a North Korean general talking about Treadstone on an open wire? 
  What's Treadstone? 
  That's classified, Tara. 
  We shut that down years ago, Dan. 
  Kwon was part of the program. 
  [DEEP RHYTHMIC MUSIC] 
  Did he mention Stiletto Six? 
  No. 
  I think he was playing your people. 
  He's playing with us, Ellen. 
  Yeah, today he dangles the possibility of defection, then he's digging up skeletons precisely so that we will have conversations like this one. 
  If you don't trust me, don't expect me to trust you. 
  You're playing me right now. 
  Thanks for an interesting afternoon. 
  We did shut down Treadstone right? 
  It was bigger than we thought. 
  So who are these cicadas he's talking about waking up?

  How do you know about those? 
  She asked if I'd check and make sure you were taking 'em. 
  My wife asked you to make sure I'm taking my pills? 
  Not my business, I'm staying out of it.

  It's a great day for ExPo Energy. 
  Congress has passed the bill that approves our deal with our Russian partners. 
  This should nearly double our capacity in the next five years. 
  But I'm not gonna lie It's not good news for everyone here. 
  I'm afraid I have some personnel changes to announce. 
  Several members of the senior staff will be staying on but all level one, two, and three derrickmen, motormen, and roughnecks will be replaced effective immediately. 
  f*ck you talking about? 
  [ALL CLAMORING] 
  Starting tomorrow morning a Russian crew will be taking over. 
  [OVERLAPPING SHOUTING]
