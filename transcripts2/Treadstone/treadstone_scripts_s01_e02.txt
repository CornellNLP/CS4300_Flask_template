 You are a Cicada. 
  I don't think I can do it. 
  I know you can. 
  I believe in you.

  We've got Matt Edwards on the ground. 
  - She's a journalist. 
  - Used to be. 
  - Tara Coleman. 
  - I have a daughter. 
  Bring her to the Ecuadorian embassy in Paris. 
  We don't have much time. 
  They're waking them up. 
  - Waking who up? 
  - Cicadas. 
  It is starting again. 
  - What's starting again? 
  - Treadstone. 
  We did shut down Treadstone, right? 
  It was bigger than we thought.

  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  Do I know you? 
  Those memories they're just gone. 
  [TIRES SQUEALING] 
  You don't know how much I missed you, John. 
  [POUNDS ON LOCKER] 
  [SCOFFS] 
  I can't remember my combination. 
  Try zero, nine, zero, nine, 69. 
  "Fortunate Son" release date. 
  Ah, you wore that record out in Hanoi. 
  Thanks, Frank. 
  Never got a chance to thank you. 
  Don't bother. 
  You would've done the same for me. 
  No, don't play it down, John. 
  Fact is, you really did it. 
  You let them take you, and that gave me enough time to escape. 
  Ah, it all worked out in the end. 
  Always said if we could make it through the jungles of Vietnam, we could handle anything together. 
  Well, it's a different kind of jungle now. 
  - Yeah. 
  - You see Matheson out there? 
  - He just got back. 
  - Let him get his bearings. 
  Hey, man, that's easy for you to say. 
  My partner's still out there. 
  I don't know where he is, Pete. 
  Hey, come on, give him some space, Wilson. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Hey, what did they tell my mother? 
  - Agency protocol. 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  So she thinks I'm dead? 
  Oh I was only gone a week. 
  John, you were missing for nine months. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  How you holding up? 
  I've lost nine months. 
  I have no idea what happened to me during that time, and my mother thinks I'm dead. 
  How do you think I'm holding up, Frank? 
  - Yeah, I know you got to be spinning. 
  - Then why'd you ask? 
  I figured it was a better approach than the awkward silence that happens when two guys don't know what the hell - is really going on. 
  - What is going on? 
  The station chief is gonna have questions lots of them. 
  Are you ready to give them answers? 
  Yeah, I'll give them everything I can remember. 
  Like anything they did to you while you were gone. 
  Well, I don't remember any details. 
  Well, was there anyone that you were connected with, someone that we could identify or leverage? 
  It's so nice to see you back, Mr. 
  Bentley. 
  It's good to be home, Margie. 
  [NUMBER PAD BEEPING] 
  Nine months is a long time behind the curtain. 
  Chief just wants you to tell them what you do remember. 
  I'll be right outside, pal. 
  [DOOR BUZZES] 
  - Dennis Kohler. 
  - I'm the new station chief. 
  Welcome home, Bentley. 
  Thank you, sir. 
  Sounds like you've been to hell and back. 
  I speak for everyone in this station when I say we're glad you came home in one piece. 
  What happened to Morris? 
  - Morris's wife had a baby. 
  - He's back in D. C. 
  Why don't you start at the beginning, John? 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Frank Ferguson and I deployed to KrakÃ³w to gather intel on a Soviet control program code-named Tsikada being headed by a former Nazi named Dr. 
  Gustav Meisner. 
  - We were there two weeks. 
  - What did you learn? 
  Meisner's lab was located inside a Soviet prison on the outskirts of town. 
  That's where he had an endless supply of subjects. 
  We were able to confirm that this Tsikada program was designed to create human weapons. 
  Explain that. 
  They developed a method to strip away a person's identity. 
  Employed hypnosis, uh, drugs, electrical stimulation in certain areas of the brain. 
  To what end? 
  To make people do things that they would never normally consider. 
  Ferguson and I received orders to terminate Dr. 
  Meisner and secure all of his research. 
  Which didn't go quite as planned. 
  I was captured. 
  Ferguson got away. 
  He claims you sacrificed yourself for him. 
  That's not exactly agency policy, but it's admirable. 
  They tried to break me. 
  Kept me in isolation tortured me withheld food and water. 
  Uh, I was drugged with hallucinogenics. 
  I tried to hold on to something, you know? 
  My name, my memories. 
  Some thoughts of my own, but it was like trying to grasp water in your hand. 
  What do you remember? 
  There was a woman with red hair. 
  Her name was Petra. 
  Somehow, she knew everything about me. 
  I tried to fight it, but My thoughts they weren't my own. 
  And how'd that make you feel? 
  It's like I was becoming someone more More whole. 
  - More - More what? 
  Complete. 
  I finished my mission. 
  It never occurred to you that they let you finish it? 
  No. 
  Small price to pay in exchange for sending one of the CIA's own operatives back - as a double agent. 
  - I'm not a traitor. 
  I want to order some deeper psych evaluations, keep you under observation for a while. 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - Prep him for transport. 
  Cuffs through the table. 
  [GUN CLICKS, CLATTERS ON GROUND] 
  [DOOR BUZZES] 
  Talk some sense into him, Ferguson. 
  What the hell did you just do? 
  Sidearm, Frank. 
  What now, John? 
  I'm gonna walk out of here and I'm gonna prove that I'm telling the truth. 
  It's the most secure facility in West Berlin. 
  You won't make it to the elevator. 
  That's why he's coming with me. 
  Access code only. 
  Type the distress key, I'll put a bullet in your left knee. 
  [NUMBER PAD BEEPING] 
  [DOOR BUZZES, OPENS] 
  What the f*ck, John? 
  Kohler thinks I've been turned. 
  He didn't give me any other choice. 
  You didn't have to do this. 
  You could've figured this out another way. 
  - [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
  - Congratulations. 
  What? 
  We just made it to the elevator. 
  Look, you saved my ass in KrakÃ³w, but I'm not hurting any station personnel to help you get out of here. 
  [ELEVATOR WHIRRING] 
  [ELEVATOR BELL DINGING] 
  Code 18, be advised possible situation on floor eight involving John Randolph Bentley. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY]

  No, they won't.

  Oh, man. 
  [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
  I had too much to drink last night. 
  What the hell happened at the bar? 
  I don't know. 
  It won't happen again. 
  Well, if it does, warn me first. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  T-that woman I was with at the bar, are you sure you didn't see her? 
  Nope. 
  And even if I did, I wouldn't speak a word about it. 
  Come on, man, it's not like that. 
  You're going home to your wife tonight. 
  What happens in the Arctic stays in the Arctic. 
  [AIRPLANE BELL CHIMES] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now making our final descent. 
  Please make sure your seatbacks and General Kwon's dead. 
  They think it was a hit. 
  He calls out Treadstone on an open wire, and 24 hours later, he's gone? 
  Treadstone had a very wide scope. 
  Like Blackbriar. 
  Yes, but the one Kwon was referring to is called Cicada. 
  Cicada? 
  Sleeper agents deployed into normal cover lives with no memory of their training. 
  Well, how would Kwon have that intel? 
  Because he was part of the program. 
  Kwon was one of Cicada's handlers. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  What the f*ck is going on, Ellen? 
  I was there when that asset went rogue in New York, remember? 
  I saw the hunt up close. 
  He was doing what the agency wasn't willing to do trying to end Treadstone an unsanctioned black ops program run amok. 
  Don't get emotional. 
  [SIGHS] 
  If someone's bringing it back, we need to stop it. 
  I know. 
  So what are you thinking? 
  Treadstone used someone named Martin Wells. 
  He was a specialist in behavioral modification. 
  Now, if someone's waking up these assets, he might know how it could be done. 
  Okay. 
  How far back does this go? 
  As far as the Cold War.

  Hello? 
  It's Matt Edwards. 
  What do you want? 
  I want to know what you're doing. 
  Right now I'm wondering how you got my number. 
  - I work for the CIA. 
  - Why are you in Paris? 
  - Yeah, I got to go, Matt. 
  - Listen to me. 
  Off the record, General Kwon is dead. 
  - How did he die? 
  - Suspiciously. 
  Now, I want to know everything Kwon told you about Treadstone. 
  He told me not to trust the CIA. 
  I sent you to talk to him 24 hours ago, and now the person you made contact with is dead, Tara. 
  You heard everything he said. 
  I didn't hear what he said after the wire cut out. 
  You're in Paris. 
  Kwon has a daughter in Paris, and we just flagged two North Korean SSD operatives landing at De Gaulle five minutes ago. 
  Kwon's daughter is in danger, which means you might be, too. 
  I can handle myself. 
  Six men is an extraction unit. 
  Two men is a kill team. 
  Now, I'm gonna ask you one more - [CELL PHONE BEEPS] 
  - [GROANS] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [NUMBER PAD BEEPING] 
  - Hello? 
  - [LINE TRILLING] 
  [WOMAN SPEAKING FRENCH] 
  Hello, I need to speak to Jang-Mi Kwon. 
  It's urgent. 
  - She's off campus today. 
  - Where'd she go? 
  It is against school policy to disclose our students' whereabouts.

  And remember, upward strokes are your friend. 
  Love your scarf. 
  So quaint. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  First class? 
  I've been waiting in this dump for you to get back to me about a seat opening in first class. 
  Or are you just too old and forgot I asked? 
  This man has worked at his job for longer than you have been alive, manning his station each day, never questioning his role, performing his duty. 
  What are you contributing? 
  [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] 
  And I can't tell you why [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN OVER P. A ] 
  - [LINE TRILLING] 
  - Hello? 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Jang-Mi? 
  I need to talk to you about your father. 
  Who are you? 
  Look, I know you don't know me, but we don't have a lot of time. 
  Let's get out of here. 
  Please, just give me a minute. 
  She doesn't want to talk to you. 
  It's important. 
  If my father wants to talk to me, then he can talk to me himself. 
  It's not that simple. 
  It's actually very simple. 
  Just leave us alone. 
  There's something I'm supposed to give to you, Jang-Mi. 
  I just need five minutes. 
  How do you know my father? 
  I used to be a journalist. 
  And 24 hours ago, your father asked to meet me. 
  He asked me to bring you that medallion and take you to someone at the Ecuadorian embassy in Paris. 
  I'm just gonna call him right now. 
  I'm sorry, Jang-Mi. 
  You can't. 
  He's been killed. 
  And I think the same people who killed him are on their way here for you. 
  Please trust me. 
  [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] 
  You didn't tell her you were coming home. 
  Did you at least tell her Expo fired our asses? 
  No. 
  I was hoping the surprise would take the stink off it. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
 
 
 
  sh1t. 
  I'll make some calls around town, see if anyone's hiring. 
  Man, I wanted a better life for Samantha. 
  Go on in there, Romeo. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  - [GUN COCKS] 
  - I will shoot. 
  Oh, my God. 
  - Baby. 
  - [GUN CLATTERS] 
  - Baby. 
  - Hey. 
  Hey. 
  I thought you were some bandit about to rob me. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  "Bandit"? 
  Wait, what happened? 
  Just banged my head. 
  Well, you want to go upstairs and I can take a look at it? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Yeah. 
  You been feeling okay? 
  The headaches. 
  I get one every once in a while. 
  I can talk to some doctors at work and get you some more of those pills. 
  No, no more pills, Sam. 
  I can manage. 
  Well, if they start getting bad, you need to let me know, Doug. 
  Promise? 
  [BOTH SIGH] 
  Did something happen out there? 
  A bunch of the riggers got laid off. 
  - Me, Mike - Yeah, I figured. 
  The company outsourced their jobs. 
  [SIGHS] 
  You need to find a place that just treats you like an actual human being. 
  I've got that here with you. 
  Kiss me. 
  [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [APPLAUSE] 
  Now, when I snap my fingers, you will be fully awake, and when you hear me say the word "poultry", you'll become a chicken and do all the things that a chicken does. 
  So, Bob, earlier you were telling us how you were a vegetarian. 
  That's right. 
  So you don't eat fish or meat? 
  - No, sir. 
  - Not even chicken or some other kind of poultry. 
  [CLUCKING] 
  [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] 
  Hey, Tommy, did I forget to tell you? 
  Happy birthday. 
  Thanks, Doc. 
  It's on the house. 
  I enjoyed your show. 
  Is that a Virginia accent I hear? 
  Or it is a Langley twang? 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  Treadstone. 
  It's in the past. 
  I was on the ground in New York when Blackbriar got blown. 
  Department of Support? 
  Special Activities. 
  What do you know about the people who volunteered for Treadstone? 
  I know they were dangerous. 
  That's your first mistake. 
  - How so? 
  - They were more than that. 
  These are men and women who gave up all their personal power to an institution they assumed was on the right side of things. 
  - Turned out it wasn't. 
  - That's not their fault. 
  Tell me about what you did for the Cicada program. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I developed protocols to program candidates who were susceptible to hypnotic triggers a word, a tune, an image. 
  This type of method was used to wake them up. 
  And you're saying that actually worked? 
  Hey, Tommy, did I forget to tell you? 
  - Happy birthday. 
  - Thanks, Doc. 
  It's on the house. 
  Success rate with the assets during their training was above 85%. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Someone's waking them up. 
  I know. 
  This is a news story about a psycho who shot up a 7-Eleven. 
  It's not proof that someone's waking up assets. 
  Look closer. 
  What do you see? 
  He runs a smooth, one-handed garment clear and puts six rounds down range in less than a second. 
  Impressive attributes, but not enough to warrant our concern, right? 
  Until we look closer. 
  Most right-handed shooters shoot left to right. 
  Now, this guy goes right, left, center, left. 
  That's extremely skilled target selection - in a high-pressure situation. 
  - Keep going. 
  Well, he starts with youngest and most physically fit and saves the oldest for last because he presents the lowest threat level. 
  And then he turns the page in the blink of an eye. 
  No jitters, no adrenaline dump. 
  Absolutely zero leakage. 
  This happened three days ago. 
  How'd the police catch this guy? 
  Quite easily this man exited the store and simply sat down on the curb almost like his mission was complete, How do you explain that? 
  The longer an asset's been sleeping, the more unreliable he might prove to be upon activation. 
  I want to talk to this guy, and I want you to come with me. 
  Let's hope it works this time.

  Hey. 
  Where do we stand? 
  Edwards is looking into Kwon's allegations. 
  What's your take? 
  He took a huge risk reaching out to us, and I think once his people found out, they had him killed. 
  All right, do we know what this - Tara Coleman. 
  - Yeah, about Stiletto Six. 
  No, but let's not forget that he did request her for a reason. 
  - Do we know why? 
  - Not yet. 
  She says that Kwon didn't say anything about it. 
  You believe her? 
  I'll keep you updated. 
  I always knew my father was a target. 
  A man in his position in my country is always at risk. 
  I just never thought anything would actually happen to him. 
  I didn't get to spend much time with General Kwon, but he was trying to do the right thing. 
  It doesn't feel real yet. 
  None of this feels real. 
  - You're not alone, babe. 
  - I'm right here with you. 
  [ENGINE REVVING, TIRES SQUEALING] 
  We've got a problem. 
  [ENGINE REVVING, TIRES SQUEALING] 
  Put on your seat belt. 
  - How far to the embassy? 
  - Still a few more blocks. 
  [TIRES SCREECHING] 
  [HORNS BLARING] 
  Look out! 
  Brace yourself. 
  - Aah! 
  - [CAR ALARM BLARING] 
  Oh, f*ck. 
  They're right behind us. 
  [TIRES SCREECHING] 
  Crap. 
  [TIRES SQUEALING] 
  - [HORN HONKING] 
  - Move! 
  Get out the way! 
  [PANICKED CHATTER] 
  - [SOBS] 
  - [PANTING] 
  [WOMAN SHOUTS IN FRENCH] 
  Hold on. 
  One more block! 
  Are they still back there? 
  Look at me. 
  We're gonna make it, okay? 
  Aaaaaah!
