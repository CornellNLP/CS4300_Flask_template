 - Where is the money, Tara? 
  - What money? 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  [SCREAMS] 
  No! 
  Enter the access key! 
  [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
  Nolan, it's Tara Coleman. 
  Tell me what you know about Treadstone. 
  Ask me again if you're ever passing through Moscow. 
  What are you planning on doing with Stiletto Six? 
  That is not your concern. 
  - Are you selling the missile? 
  - Petrushka I deserve to know. 
  A group of North Koreans are purchasing it. 
  [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  That's the woman who woke you up? 
  This is a rogue agent helping a psychopathic killer escape the authorities, and none of it is agency sanctioned. 
  This ends now! 
  [BOTH SPEAKING KOREAN] 
  I ran into some people from Treadstone. 
  I overheard them talking. 
  They're sending a team to our house. 
  And they're planning on killing some guy named Marcus Sachs tonight. 
  They're sending another asset. 
  They're gonna murder him and his wife. 
  We need to help him, Sam. 
  We got to do something. 
  [GASPS, BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  [WOMAN BREATHING RAPIDLY] 
  [COUGHING] 
  Oh. 
  - Marcus? 
  - My wife. 
  He's using your wife as a trap. 
  Who? 
  The man sent here to kill you. 
  - I need to see my wife! 
  - Hey. 
  That's exactly what he wants you to do. 
  Trust me. 
  Listen. 
  Get back behind that corner, stay low, avoid the windows. 
  Hey, move, please. 
  Okay? 
  [WOMAN WHIMPERING] 
  [FOREBODING MUSIC] 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Hey, listen, we got you, all right? 
  Just shh. 
  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  Vincent, please. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  [GROANS IN PAIN] 
  [CHOKING] 
  [SHOUTS, CHOKES] 
  [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
  Sam? 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  They're both dead. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  This is where both of us are gonna end up just two bodies lying on the floor somewhere. 
  I don't want you to die in my arms. 
  Okay, listen, let's keep moving. 
  We can't move fast enough. 
  That guy you followed, he's gonna let Treadstone know that you're alive, and they're gonna find us. 
  Doug. 
  It's gonna sound crazy, but hear me out. 
  He's my height. 
  He's my weight. 
  Complexion's close enough. 
  Sam, I can pass as him. 
  Yeah, I mean, if you shave and cut your hair, but wait. 
  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, this is insane. 
  But sure, if I mean, if they think you're dead, it will buy us time. 
  I'll code in as Vincent. 
  Let's see if we can access his phone using facial recognition. 
  [SIGHS] 
  - [PHONE BEEPS] 
  - Okay. 
  We tell 'em the target's down. 
  [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] 
  We tell 'em I'm down, too. 
  And then you're Vincent? 
  Send it in. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [SNIFFS] 
  It's an order to destroy your body. 
  Let's do it. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [SIGHS] 
  [MUFFLED DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Yuri. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES] 
  I put my best men on the job. 
  Then Tell Nolan Tara Coleman is here. 
  Tara Coleman. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Hey, Tara. 
  I need your help. 
  What is this? 
  Oh, we're harvesting footage from a Pakistani Air Force drone. 
  For who? 
  Corporate clients thinking about investing heavily in Karachi. 
  Tell me about Treadstone. 
  Huh, nice to see you, too. 
  I just watched a mercenary hold a gun to Meghan's head and pull the trigger. 
  We both know she'd want us to keep pushing ahead. 
  What does that entail? 
  - Getting answers. 
  - Answers about what? 
  Treadstone, Stiletto Six, Yuri Leniov, the North Koreans We could get killed for just having this conversation. 
  Slow down. 
  My moves are only as good as the information that I have, and I need more of it. 
  That's not a plan. 
  Did you have a plan when you leaked the Crypt 4 story to me? 
  Do you remember Blackbriar? 
  The CIA black ops unit that got exposed in the press years ago. 
  Blackbriar was part of Treadstone. 
  At first, I thought it was some kind of assassination program, but it's deeper than that. 
  They deal with human performance and enhancement. 
  I'm talking about the next wave of military operations. 
  And tell me about Yuri Leniov. 
  I will never let this come back on you, Nolan. 
  All right, listen up. 
  Get me everything on Yuri Leniov. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  We got about an hour before the CIA tracks us down. 
  I'm working on a plan. 
  You need to turn me in. 
  No. 
  You have to, Edwards. 
  Make them think you're cooperating. 
  In their eyes, I'm aiding a killer. 
  They want both of us dead. 
  Okay, cut a deal with them, then your life for mine. 
  I won't do that to you. 
  You said you want to know who's waking us up. 
  - I do. 
  - Then you have to keep going without me. 
  - We'll figure this out. 
  - [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
  Look, you did your part, okay? 
  You gave me the chance to see my daughter. 
  And I'm good. 
  [SIGHS DEEPLY] 
  I need to go back to Treadstone. 
  - What? 
  - [SIREN APPROACHING] 
  I'm gonna reach out to them and find out what the hell is going on. 
  [SIRENS WAILING, HORNS BLARING] 
  They will f*cking kill you, Sam. 
  No, no, they know me. 
  They'll want to hear me out first. 
  What are you gonna tell them? 
  I don't know. 
  I'll tell 'em that you disappeared on me three days ago and that I'm f*cking scared. 
  I'll tell them that I made a mistake, I'm sorry, I want to make things right. 
  - I'll improvise. 
  - No, this is too dangerous. 
  Don't you want to find out what the f*ck is going on? 
  When does this end? 
  It just has to end when we know that we're safe. 
  And it ends when we're back together. 
  I saw a quarry on the way over here. 
  We can drop Vincent there, okay? 
  Yeah, okay. 
  [ENGINE TURNING OVER] 
  So, like most ex-KGB guys who got rich after the Cold War, Yuri had most of his files sealed or destroyed. 
  It says here he worked on the Stiletto Six missile program. 
  Almost everyone else who worked on it with him is dead. 
  This guy Max Schneider he was found dead just a couple days ago. 
  FSB called it a suicide. 
  Slashed his own wrists open in the bathroom. 
  He was one of Yuri's investment partners dating back to the 1990s. 
  What else did Yuri and Max work on together whilst they were in the KGB? 
  Something called Cicada. 
  [KEYS CLACKING] 
  General Kwon in London he said, "They're waking people up. 
  The cicadas it's starting again". 
  - Cicada's analog. 
  - Meaning? 
  It's an older physical file. 
  It was never digitized. 
  I need to see it. 
  Kwon mentioned Cicada and was leading me to Stiletto Six there's a connection. 
  It's in the RGVA Russian State Military Archive. 
  And it was opened for academic research in 1990. 
  Do you know where it's located? 
  Oh, it says here the file's stored in an access-restricted room. 
  If you can harvest Pakistani drone footage, you can get me credentials. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Special Activities will have a unit waiting to intercept us. 
  I told you they want us both dead. 
  Edwards trust me. 
  They're heading west on Anderson Highway at 52 miles an hour. 
  Target will make contact with Alpha Team in 30 seconds. 
  Hive, this is Alpha One. 
  Be advised, we have visual on the target. 
  Clear copy, Alpha One. 
  Confirm weapons free. 
  Repeat, confirm weapons free. 
  There has to be another way, Dan. 
  Haynes has killed seven people. 
  Edwards is still one of ours. 
  Are you willing to bet our careers on it? 
  Testify to that in front of a f*cking Senate committee? 
  Alpha One to Hive. 
  We have a visual on the target. 
  Please confirm weapons free. 
  Permission to engage. 
  No, I'm not doing this. 
  This is Hive, weapons are free. 
  Confirmed. 
  We're in their range. 
  Right there, break left! 
  [TIRES SQUEALING] 
  Alpha Team has lost visual. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Switching satellite imager to FLIR. 
  - What's Alpha Team's position? 
  - 100 yards out. 
  - We have a problem. 
  - What is it? 
  There's only one man in that car. 
  Jesus Christ. 
  Let me see your hands! 
  Where the hell is Stephen Haynes? 
  We have visual on Matt Edwards. 
  We need eyes on Haynes! 
  Haynes is gone. 
  [COMPUTER WHIRRING] 
  It's Matt Edwards. 
  All right, route it through our audio. 
  - Matt? 
  - I want to come in. 
  - Then why did you run? 
  - I know the mission directive. 
  I was running with Alpha when Blackbriar blew up, remember? 
  I know they're here to kill us. 
  Who authorized this Levine? 
  Oh, you got it all wrong, Matt. 
  If anything happens to me, Haynes is gonna turn this place into a f*cking slaughterhouse. 
  We can discuss this, Matt. 
  Instruct Alpha One to take the shot. 
  You give me 30 seconds to talk this through. 
  Haynes is posted up with my AR-15 and 200 rounds of ammunition. 
  Get me a f*cking heat signature on Haynes. 
  There is no signature for him, sir. 
  How is that possible? 
  Edwards could be bluffing. 
  Haynes might be long gone by now. 
  Matt I need proof that Haynes is on site. 
  [GUNSHOTS] 
  Hive, we're under fire. 
  Unknown shooter. 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  Where's the shooter? 
  He could be using a reflective blanket. 
  God damn it. 
  What's it gonna be, Ellen? 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Do what he says. 
  Matt, I'll see you soon. 
  Come on out with your hands up. 
  Hive, we have the shooter. 
  Hold it there. 
  Put your weapon on the ground! 
  Now! 
  - [ZIP TIE CLICKING] 
  - On the ground. 
  That's affirmative, Alpha Team leader. 
  Edwards and Haynes both in custody. 
  [ZIP TIE CLICKING] 
  Alpha, what is their proximity to your current position? 
  Uh, two klicks. 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  You will get the first bite, as agreed. 
  The warhead is already en route to Cyprus. 
  [SPEAKS KOREAN] 
  - [WOMAN SCREAMING] 
  - Who the hell is that? 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [PATRONS SCREAMING] 
  [MUTED ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
  Aah! 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [CROWD CHEERING] 
  [PATRONS SCREAM] 
  Aah! 
  Aah! 
  [PANICKED CHATTER] 
  [TIRES SQUEALING] 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - Turn off the cameras. 
  - Matt. 
  I don't trust anyone in this place. 
  All that footage will do is put a target on our backs. 
  And when did you stop trusting me? 
  Around the same time you issued a kill order on Stephen Haynes. 
  That was an execution, Ellen. 
  That was justified. 
  He signed over his life to this place. 
  He let them erase everything that might have gotten in the way of his service. 
  I think he deserved more than a bullet. 
  He killed seven people. 
  - Don't you want to know why? 
  - Of course I want to know why. 
  You're too busy thinking about optics and running risk analysis. 
  How dare you? 
  You're protecting yourself. 
  No, I was protecting you today, Matt. 
  Haynes could have helped us. 
  I have a family. 
  You think they'd want to see you covering up mistakes for the CIA? 
  I think they want to see me stay out of f*cking prison, is what I think. 
  I'm the one who signed off on this operation. 
  I am the one who gave you the freedom to go out and investigate, and I got a trail of f*cking bodies in return. 
  You went dark, and you left me holding the bag. 
  And let me tell you something If this goes public it's me that's gonna burn. 
  Who woke up Haynes? 
  I don't know. 
  Why did he kill an ExPo whistle-blower in that store? 
  Who was the agency woman in the photo I sent you? 
  What's her connection to all of this? 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Go home, Matt. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [KEYS CLACKING] 
  [SIGHS] 
  [KEYS CLACKING] 
  [PRINTER WHIRRING] 
 
 
 
  God damn it, Ellen. 
  He's locked out, sir. 
  Get me a full surveillance package on Matt Edwards effective immediately. 
  Yes, sir. 
  All right everyone, she's in the lobby. 
  [DEVICE BEEPS] 
  - What's the holdup? 
  - Her ID card should be clear. 
  - Well, it's not. 
  Hurry up. 
  - [GROANS] 
  Don't give it to him. 
  He'll know it's fake. 
  I'm trying a different packet. 
  Try faster. 
  [DEVICE BEEPS] 
  [DOOR BUZZES] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  [DEVICE BEEPS, DOOR BUZZES] 
  Okay, so, remember, you're a visiting professor researching Cold War tariffs. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Okay, so you're gonna go straight and up the stairs in three, two, one, now. 
  Okay, so, when you're at the top of the stairs, you're gonna take your left and around, keep going, going, and stop. 
  Okay, Row R, shelf 44. 
  Okay. 
  Start uploading images. 
  [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] 
  Okay, now hold still. 
  There's a guard right under you. 
  Okay, clear. 
  Okay, Yuri Leniov was a KGB major back in the '70s. 
  He was managing Cicada. 
  What was he working on specifically? 
  Any items with intelligence value have been blacked out. 
  All I see are random locations and names. 
  [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
  Uh, cross-reference those Cicada names against those on the Stiletto Six program. 
  [KEYS CLACKING] 
  - [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
  - All right, we got a hit. 
  Sergeant Petra Andropov. 
  There's a guard coming in less than ten seconds. 
  I'm not done. 
  Get out of there. 
  Five, four, three, two Okay, what do we got? 
  Born in Moscow. 
  December 19, 1951. 
  Parents were part of a farming collective in St. 
  Petersburg. 
  That's where she was raised. 
  Graduated from the KGB Academy in 1968, top of her class. 
  Married a civilian named Oleg Volkov but kept her maiden name. 
  Okay, financials? 
  Nothing since 1995. 
  No bank accounts, no credit cards, no utility bills, zero digital footprint. 
  - How is that possible? 
  - It's not. 
  Three, two, one, now. 
  All we know is that Yuri oversaw Sergeant Andropov's work on the Cicadas in the '70s and the Stiletto Six program until 1995. 
  She was still a sergeant in 1995? 
  Yeah. 
  That woman was a rising star in the KGB, and for some reason, her career totally stalled after Cicada. 
  - [DEVICE BEEPS, DOOR BUZZES] 
  - It's an anomaly. 
  Yuri Leniov is the bookend to her career. 
  - They have a history. 
  - Too bad she's a ghost. 
  Where's her husband now? 
  I have an address for him in Kursk. 
  Give it to me. 
  This is the address on Vincent's driver's license. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I don't know if this is gonna work. 
  - It has to work. 
  - It's a long shot, Doug. 
  You trained this guy, you know everything about him. 
  Yeah, but now I've got to give you a lifetime of information before he gets tasked with another mission. 
  I can do this with your help. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Vincent has a cache hidden somewhere Passports, IDs, money. 
  Let's find it. 
  We made him an art dealer Cover for international flights, one-man business, diverse contacts. 
  What was his life like? 
  Father was Wall Street, mother was in fashion. 
  Upper West Side, Dalton, house in Montauk. 
  What the hell's that mean? 
  Vincent's cover story was that he came from money. 
  Yeah? 
  Wife? 
  Uh, ex-wife Married six years, no kids, former model. 
  They met at a Cindy Sherman retrospective. 
  [HOLLOW KNOCKING] 
  Found it He was fluent in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Mandarin, and Farsi. 
  - He spoke eight languages? 
  - Yeah. 
  Hey, same as you. 
  Cicadas spent their lives undercover. 
  If I'm gonna become Vincent, we better get started. 
  Well, he tore his right ACL during the first month of training and always favored it subconsciously. 
  Like this? 
  Yeah, good. 
  What else? 
  Combat medicine, wilderness survival, disaster relief. 
  How to run a tail, lose a tail, and pick nine different locks in less than a minute. 
  You know the Koran by heart and the right place to sit during a tea ceremony in Szechuan. 
  He wrote with his left hand and did everything else with his right. 
  [GUN CLICKS] 
  [RAZOR BUZZING]

  - It's good to hear your voice. 
  - Are you okay? 
  Well, I've been through a lot since the last time we talked. 
  That makes two of us. 
  What is this about? 
  Yuri Leniov. 
  His men murdered my friend Meghan in Berlin right in front of my face. 
  Jesus. 
  He's connected to Stiletto Six and an old program called Cicada. 
  General Kwon mentioned it. 
  I remember. 
  It's an old Russian program. 
  Everyone who worked on it with him is dead except for the woman I'm going to see right now. 
  Well, who is she? 
  She's a former KGB agent called Andropov. 
  Okay, find out everything you can and call me as soon as you finish. 
  I will. 
  [LINE CLICKS] 
  [WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] 
  Sergeant Andropov? 
  Who are you? 
  My name is Tara Coleman. 
  I'd to talk to you about Yuri Leniov. 
  I'm a journalist. 
  Come in. 
  Let's have some tea. 
  Getting hard to sleep, blood is in my dreams Love is killing me, trying to figure it out Nothing better to do when I'm stuck on you I'm still in here trying to figure it out
