  [GUNSHOTS] 
  A great soldier for our cause. 
  I've lost nine months. 
  I have no idea what happened to me during that time, and my mother thinks I'm dead. 
  Real answers only come after you've left your mind far behind. 
  And how do I do that? 
  I'll guide you. 
  The woman who woke you up, what's her name?

  Have you seen the news? 
  That that guy I saw you kill last night might have been a cop, Doug. 
  - f*ck! 
  - I can't go back to jail. 
  I know what I was doing there. 
  It was just supposed to be an easy gig, just a couple of runs. 
  What were you doing there?

  Separate yourself from the experience. 
  [SIGHS] 
  That's it. 
  Let it go. 
  Where are you? 
  What do you see now? 
  It's like I'm watching myself. 
  I'm back in KrakÃ³w. 
  [MAN SHOUTING]

  You got to go, Frank. 
  Now. 
  f*ck. 
  We'll find you.

  [LIGHTER CLICKS] 
  How much does the CIA know about this facility? 
  How much does the CIA know about this facility? 
  I understand. 
  You think we're monsters because we're KGB. 
  You've been programmed. 
  Your whole life, you've been fed ideas about good and evil, about right and wrong. 
  You've been torturing people in here. 
  One day, men and women will volunteer for this program. 
  - You're delusional. 
  - No. 
  I'm at war. 
  Well, whatever you're gonna do to me, just get it over with.

  Hey. 
  You're a cop, huh? 
  I'm a cop, Douglas. 
  It's how things get done around here. 
  Your buddy gets spooked, drops the dime. 
  I get the call. 
  Simple. 
  You people come here and tell us that we have to work with this guy, which we do, by the way. 
  He kills Patty Vernon, and then you want us to deal with this psychopath? 
  Are you serious? 
  - I'll deal with him. 
  - You'll deal with him. 
  Is this the gun you used on Patty? 
  Yeah. 
  Dirty cop killed her, not you. 
  Where's Lowell? 
  I don't I don't know anyone named Lowell. 
  The man who made contact with you at your residence. 
  He came inside, we spoke for a few minutes, and then he left. 
  Well, we can't reach him. 
  That's not my problem. 
  Actually, this is a problem for us both, Doug. 
  I did my job. 
  Lowell's missing. 
  I had to take two flights to get out here and clean up his f*cking mess. 
  What was this all about? 
  Huh? 
  This Patty Vernon. 
  Stay on mission. 
  Carry out orders. 
  Orders from who? 
  You? 
  What is it about Lowell that you're not telling me? 
  I told you. 
  I don't know anything. 
  Why don't we go pick up your wife, continue this discussion with her? 
  I always liked Sam. 
  Too bad she had to go off the reservation. 
  [GUNSHOT] 
  [GROANS] 
  f*ck!

  [CROWD CHEERING] 
  He's gotten so much better, babe. 
  Can I talk to you about something? 
  Sure, what about? 
  You know Matt Edwards? 
  He's involved in something pretty dangerous, and I'm backing his play. 
  Well, you've been his guardian angel for years now. 
  Yeah, but this is different. 
  He's making it personal, and he's taking chances that he shouldn't be taking. 
  - And he's putting you at risk? 
  - Could be. 
  If it hasn't already. 
  Matt's been a good friend to you, but maybe it's time to start drawing some lines in the sand. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Tom, you know the world I work in. 
  There are no straight lines. 
  [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  [CROWD CHEERING] 
  Still no word on Edwards. 
  We can't get a location on him? 
  He knows what he's doing, Dan. 
  He's smart enough to avoid leaving a trail. 
  Come on. 
  He's chasing Stephen Haynes, a likely Treadstone asset, and we're completely out of the loop? 
  Look, Edwards, to me, the greatest gift that a warrior can give is their life. 
  Once I got discharged, I started to realize that that gift had been taken away from me. 
  So you signed up for Treadstone to get that gift back. 
  Didn't really work out that way. 
  No. 
  His name isn't Stephen Haynes. 
  It's Jacob Vickers. 
  Jesus, Ellen, where did you find this? 
  The Cicada Protocol files were destroyed when Blackbriar was shut down. 
  Haynes remembered he had a daughter when he was under hypnosis. 
  Her name is Lilah Jane Conway. 
  So I did a biological search for her father, and I got him. 
  You okay? 
  About the doctor I don't know what happened. 
  I Something snapped. 
  I reverted to training, and I don't know. 
  I went reflexive in the moment. 
  Now that we know that Haynes is Cicada, who the hell woke him up? 
  I have a horrible, horrible feeling this is gonna lead to something much, much bigger. 
  Agreed. 
  But we need to stay focused on what's in front of us right now. 
  Matt Edwards is your guy, Haynes is our best lead, and you don't know where the f*ck either of them are right now. 
  It's okay. 
  They're just memories. 
  [ELECTRICITY BUZZING]

  Meisner's lab, not mine. 
  I'm sorry I failed you. 
  This is it. 
  Let's go. 
  - Your daughter's waiting. 
  - I'm not going to see her. 
  Then why did I bring you all the way out here? 
  You would not have brought me if I'd told you the reason I'm here. 
  God damn it, Haynes Whoever sent me into that convenience store knows my background. 
  You figured out that I would come here after I got loose. 
  I have to assume that they would figure it out too. 
  Look at the silver sedan, 5:00. 
  You think they're staking out the house. 
  That's them, Edwards. 
  f*ck. 
  [GUNSHOTS] 
  Haynes! 
  What the f*ck, Haynes?

  That's the woman who woke you up? 
  That was our only lead! 
  [SOFTLY] 
  I know. 
  [DISTANT SIRENS BLARING] 
  [CAMERA CLICKS] 
  Let's go. 
  If we move fast, you can get 30 seconds with your daughter. 
  No, the memory she has of me is better than the truth. 
  [TIRES SQUEALING] 
  Where the hell are you? 
  I need you to buy me some time. 
  Tell me where you are. 
  I just sent a photo to your secure email. 
  I need you to run it through the facial rec database. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  [SIREN BLARING] 
  Jesus, Matt. 
  I'll explain later. 
  No, you will explain right now, 'cause you are way off the f*cking grid. 
  Just run the photo, Ellen. 
  [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
  She worked for a company called Emory-Martin Incorporated. 
  What is that? 
  It's a distributor for farm equipment. 
  That doesn't make sense. 
  Matt, the agency has used this company before as a front for cover identities. 
  - I'll call you back. 
  - No, no, don't you [DIAL TONE] 
  Edwards needs an ID on this woman. 
  Who is she? 
  She's one of us. 
  She's agency. 
  Do we know who killed her? 
  Haynes and Edwards were on site. 
  We got a f*cking body count, Ellen. 
  How many more people does this guy have to kill? 
  So what are you proposing? 
  You know what we need to do.

  - No, that's not what I mean. 
  I can hear them. 
  They're all around me. 
  - They're not real. 
  - They are real! 
  It's a side effect of the training. 
  No, no, no, they're not.

  What's happening with the Patty Vernon situation? 
  She controlled a $100-million market share in bootleg opioid pills. 
  Lang Pharmaceuticals want to take it over and make it legal.

  The station sent me to find you. 
  You've been missing for months. 
  I found you in a bar here in Budapest. 
  You told me you've been on the run from the KGB, and you needed an exfiltration that night. 
  When we showed up at the rally point, it was a KGB ambush.

  I know, John. 
  I feel the same. 
  What have you done to me? 
  Hmm? 
  Don't be scared. 
  - I'm not myself anymore. 
  - I know you feel this too. 
  - It's the training. 
  - It's not the training. 
  It's us.

  Matt. 
  We need to talk about Haynes. 
  Direct action is authorized. 
  Is this your call? 
  It is the call, Matt, and that is all you need to know. 
  Are you able to carry out this directive or not? 
  You and I talked about shutting this thing down for good. 
  I sent you in to get answers.

  What are you gonna do? 
  Well, how did he respond?

  He's not compliant? 
  I didn't bring him into this because he's compliant. 
  What did Haynes tell him?
