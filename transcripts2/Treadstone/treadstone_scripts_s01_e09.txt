 Put your hands where I can see them! 
  My name is Soyun Pak. 
  I'm a citizen of North Korea, and I have urgent information for the CIA. 
  If Matheson's still alive, I need to go back and save him. 
  Him and anyone else still in there. 
  You will never find them without me. 
  Meisner's alive. 
  No, that's impossible. 
  I know he's still training Matheson and the others. 
  I can get the new location. 
  How? 
  Yuri. 
  We got a hit. 
  Sergeant Petra Andropov. 
  The Tsikadas. 
  It's an old Russian program. 
  Everyone who worked on it is dead, except for the woman I'm going to see right now. 
  I'm putting a team on it. 
  By this time tomorrow we'll have all cleaned up The cops, Doug, and Samantha. 
  Why don't we go pick up your wife? 
  Continue this discussion with her. 
  He's my height. 
  He's my weight. 
  Complexion's close enough. 
  Sam, I can pass as him. 
  I mean, if they think you're dead, it will buy us time. 
  Tell them the target's down. 
  Tell them I'm down, too. 
  And then you're Vincent? 
  How do I look? 
  Like him. 
  Hive, we have the shooter. 
  That was an execution, Ellen. 
  Haynes could've helped us. 
  I'm the one who signed off on this operation. 
  I am the one who gave you the freedom to go out and investigate, and I got a trail of f*cking bodies in return. 
  And let me tell you something. 
  If this goes public, it's me that's gonna burn. 
  No, no, no. 
  You cannot be here. 
  No, no, no. 
  Get out. 
  Inspector Van Roon. 
  Violent Crimes Division. 
  It's Matt Edwards. 
  It's been a long time. 
  What can I do for you? 
  Members of the CIA are running a global criminal syndicate. 
  That's a serious accusation. 
  I know enough to start an investigation, but I need international help. 
  They're connected to the murder of a woman in Berlin, and an American man named Jacob Vickers, alias Stephen Haynes. 
  I'd have to know more. 
  I'd like to discuss it in person. 
  I'm in Amsterdam. 
  I'll call you when I land. 
  Get me Ellen Becker. 
  Morning, Ellen. 
  Dan. 
  Consider this full disclosure. 
  About what? 
  Treadstone. 
  It's active? 
  America wants to win. 
  Barometer's victory. 
  So Kwon was right. 
  It was us all along. 
  We're advancing the national interest, Ellen. 
  Don't bullshit me. 
  I'm talking about the public and private sectors working together hand-in-hand. 
  Dan, there is no way that I am signing on to this. 
  Spare me the moral outrage. 
  Look at the condition the country is in. 
  Right and wrong have taken a back seat to winning at any cost. 
  This program, it's about keeping up. 
  I will honor my NDA, and I will stay silent but I am resigning, so consider this my notification. 
  The Agency needs you. 
  I'm not accepting your resignation. 
  You're not bringing me in, Dan. 
  You're already in. 
  I have a transcript of you instructing Matt Edwards to murder Stephen Haynes on American soil. 
  I have a recording of it, as well. 
  What, you want me in prison? 
  Is that it? 
  Well, that would be up to an independent counsel's investigation. 
  Jesus Christ. 
  You f*cking set me up. 
  You got my hands just dirty enough to hang me. 
  Only because you're the best person for the job, Ellen. 
  I needed somebody who wasn't afraid to move fast and break things. 
  The stakes are too high. 
  Hell, I'd like to have you with us. 
  Us? 
  Who is "us"? 
  I'll show you. 
  It's a pharmacological neuro-receptor antagonist. 
  They counter the hypnotic suggestibility the program implanted inside your brain. 
  Symbols like the red circle? 
  And everything else. 
  So I won't feel the urge? 
  Not as long as you got those meds in your system. 
  Dating website? 
  Yeah, this is how we stay in contact. 
  You log into the profile I created, and open up the drafts folder. 
  You check in daily, and only mark up the draft if it's an emergency. 
  11 years ago at McQuigg's Pub at Lake Barkley's, I thought I picked up the girl of my dreams. 
  Wasn't that simple, was it? 
  I went to Lake Barkley's for July 4th because you made that part of my cover. 
  You trained me to think I've been doing that my whole life. 
  Look, when they boarded the program up, I told myself I'd give it a year, that I'd give you a year to live your life and to fall in love. 
  You know, just to create something that was your own. 
  But you knew where I'd be the whole time? 
  Well, in the beginning, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  But the more time that passed, the more you'd start making decisions based on experiences, not programming. 
  Doug I'm so sorry. 
  Really, there are so many things I wish I could change. 
  You shouldn't have waited a year. 
  I'm pretty sure I spent the whole time looking for you anyway. 
  When the program got rolled up, a group of us created a series of protocols for communication. 
  It had to be analog, not digital. 
  The program was too dark, too real. 
  We had to have a way to reach out. 
  We know they've activated two assets: You and Vincent. 
  If they're waking up more, they'll want to make sure none of them glitch like you did. 
  They'll want to bring me back in so I can help them. 
  If the CIA finds out I'm still alive, they will kill you. 
  As long as you maintain your cover as Vincent, our story will hold. 
  They're gonna send Vincent another target, aren't they? 
  You're just gonna have to do what you need to in the moment, - okay? 
  - I'm not a killer. 
  Once you're back in, we may never see each other again. 
  If we want to survive, this is the only move left to make. 
  I love you, babe. 
  I love you. 
  For you, ma'am. 
  Who is this? 
  Get in the next cab that pulls up. 
  Hi, Sam. 
  Leo. 
  Go. 
  This is "us". 
  This is what you call high stakes? 
  Ellen. 
  I am looking at illegal acts of war on multiple fronts, and now you are dragging me into this sh1t? 
  What the hell is this? 
  Jesus, Dan. 
  My communiquÃ© got a response. 
  We're meeting Yuri in an hour. 
  That's all we got? 
  An hour? 
  Yes. 
  Just stick to the plan. 
  All I have to do is go back to acting like a brainwashed killer until I find Matheson and the rest. 
  You'll have to be convincing. 
  I learned from the best. 
  I'll never see Russia again. 
  Do you miss it? 
  I'll miss the countryside. 
  And I'll miss Lake Baikal. 
  That's not what I was expecting. 
  I always thought a quiet life after a career of service is an honorable thing. 
  I was wrong. 
  You know, I have my own version of Lake Baikal. 
  You do? 
  Hocking Hills, Ohio. 
  It's where I grew up. 
  There's a forest that never ends. 
  Waterfalls. 
  Sounds beautiful. 
  It could be us. 
  In Hocking Hills, Ohio. 
  It's probably no Lake Baikal. 
  It'll do. 
  I have something for you. 
  When I went back to the lab. 
  My watch. 
  It was my mother's. 
  Thank you. 
  What's your mission, John? 
  To serve. 
  Who are you? 
  I am your soldier. 
  So you came all the way out here to talk with me about Yuri. 
  Why? 
  Everyone else who worked with him over the years happens to be dead. 
  The KGB has its risks. 
  You're not in the KGB anymore. 
  I took an oath of secrecy. 
  I took an oath to protect my sources. 
  So you think I'll be your source. 
  Just give me five minutes. 
  I'm not going to talk about Yuri. 
  Why are you protecting him? 
  Why are really here? 
  I have spent years chasing down Stiletto Six, and it has destroyed my life but I can't stop thinking about it. 
  I dream about it. 
  I know Yuri is behind it, and I have to stop him. 
  I've got nowhere else left to go. 
  And you are literally the last person left who can help me. 
  That missile was our deepest secret. 
  There was a time when someone would've killed you just for saying the name Stiletto Six out loud. 
  Words meant things back then. 
  I want to show you something. 
  Are you ready to finish your training, John? 
  I'm ready, Dr. 
  Meisner. 
  After what happened last time I'll have a much closer eye on you. 
  Now you'll have company. 
  You see Matheson out there? 
  Did I kill Matheson? 
  Is he still alive? 
  He's alive. 
  No! 
  What the hell did they do to you? 
  I'm Don Matheson. 
  The Station sent me to find you. 
  You've been missing for months. 
  They're in your head. 
  Matheson is still alive. 
  I need to go back and save him. 
  Matheson? 
  Matheson? 
  Matheson? 
  You all right? 
  Yeah. 
  Who are the others? 
  One's British. 
  The other one is Spanish. 
  We're all getting out. 
  That's impossible down here. 
  I've got a way. 
  Between us, we can do it. 
  - Guards! 
  - Matheson. 
  Matheson, what are you doing? 
  This guy's not one of us. 
  Matheson. 
  Matheson. 
  It's me. 
  How do you know my name? 
  It's John Randolph Bentley. 
  We're both Americans. 
  We were at Berlin Station. 
  I don't know you. 
  I've come back here to get you out. 
  I don't want to get out. 
  Look at me. 
  All right, they've programmed you not to remember who I am. 
  I'm supposed to be here. 
  Wake up, all right! 
  Matheson has made great progress since you've been away, Bentley. 
  This is a fine opportunity to see who is truly the best of you. 
  From the moment I leave, you have one gun and one bullet. 
  Don't. 
  We have to work together, Matheson. 
  I don't know you. 
  We went through CIA officer training together at Camp Peary. 
  Then why don't I remember? 
  The Russian language course was kicking our asses. 
  The only thing that saved us was that pretty blonde tutor they brought in. 
  Her name was Andrea. 
  I don't f*cking remember! 
  Remember for Andrea. 
  Why would I remember some tutor? 
  You married her. 
  Remember for Russell and Melanie. 
  Those names mean nothing to me. 
  They're your kids. 
  No. 
  If you don't remember, I'm gonna pull the trigger. 
  I'm gonna have to look your wife and kids in the eyes and tell them what I did. 
  You know I can't leave you here alive, not after everything they programmed you to do. 
  I don't remember. 
  Last chance. 
  I don't remember. 
  I'm losing my mind, Bentley. 
  What did you just call me? 
 
 
 
  - I don't know. 
  - What did you I don't know. 
  I don't know. 
  No, no, no. 
  Shh. 
  What did you just call me? 
  What's my name? 
  Stay with me, Matheson. 
  Stay with me. 
  Look at me. 
  Andrea told me to get home safe. 
  I love her so much, John. 
  Shh. 
  Hey. 
  You with me? 
  How many are left? 
  Only two. 
  The Spaniard and the Brit. 
  Get ready. 
  Go. 
  Come around! 
  Cover me! 
  Cover me! 
  All right, time to go. 
  - Come on. 
  - I'm not leaving. 
  What, you want to stay here with Meisner? 
  I want to stay for her. 
  The woman with the red hair. 
  She said she'd always come back for me as long as I stayed here. 
  Wait. 
  What, has she been here? 
  She told me she'd never leave me. 
  You think you know her like I do? 
  I don't Come on. 
  I'm staying here! 
  We gotta go! 
  Come on. 
  Let's go. 
  Let's go. 
  John. 
  Let's go, Bentley. 
  Finish your mission. 
  You really think you fixed Matheson? 
  You think you've actually been fixed, Bentley? 
  This is all part of the plan. 
  Kill him. 
  Pull the trigger. 
  My sacrifice is part of the plan. 
  Go back to your people a true hero. 
  Finish your mission, John. 
  I'm not part of your mission. 
  No! 
  Let's go! 
  What now? 
  You first. 
  What is this place? 
  My life's work. 
  Stiletto Six. 
  The warhead has been disabled. 
  The nuclear payload was removed. 
  Yuri won. 
  Hello, Mrs. 
  Pak. 
  Your document here looks to be legitimate, but I'm afraid we'll need you to fill out some additional paperwork. 
  I need to talk to the CIA. 
  All in good time. 
  Right f*cking now. 
  Levine. 
  Keep her secure. 
  Await for further orders. 
  The embassy in Seoul got a walk-in. 
  Ms. 
  Soyun Pak. 
  A cicada? 
  Stiletto Six is in play, and Yuri Leniov's behind it. 
  Soyun overheard a conversation between Yuri and a North Korean colonel named Shin. 
  Shin has purchased the warhead and he's heading to Cyprus now. 
  You seem pretty calm considering the nuclear warhead in your backyard just went missing. 
  October 3rd A Soviet submarine malfunctioned and sank to 18,000 feet below sea level. 
  A research ship found the remains. 
  The missile hatches were forced open. 
  Tool marks were visible. 
  34 nuclear warheads were declared missing that day. 
  And they're still missing. 
  Before you spend sleepless nights wondering where your story went just remember this is the world we're all living in. 
  Yes? 
  Soyun, this is deputy director Dan Levine, and I want you to know that we are very grateful for everything you've done for us so far. 
  I want U. S. 
  citizenship for my family. 
  What do I need to do? 
  I'm sorry to say we can't just extract a family from North Korea. 
  I'm helping you avoid a war. 
  What do you know about Colonel Shin? 
  He's planning a coup, and wants my husband to take the blame. 
  If you can help us eliminate Colonel Shin, asylum for your family will be no problem. 
  We have a deal. 
  How much of this did you know? 
  Senator Wray called me in. 
  He said that he and Yuri had an opportunity to open up North Korea to global trade. 
  And when did he mention a nuclear missile, Dan? 
  He didn't. 
  Okay, so what was the proposal? 
  They needed to have General Kwon eliminated. 
  He was standing in the way of regime change in the country. 
  You know, when you brought me onto this Kwon operation, I had no idea that you were asking me to help you stage a f*cking coup. 
  The senator didn't tell me about the missile, okay? 
  I don't think he knew about it, either. 
  Because Yuri played the both of you. 
  The only way to cause immediate regime change is Pyongyang acquiring Stiletto Six. 
  That is obvious. 
  I wouldn't have sanctioned any of this if I had known a f*cking nuke was involved. 
  Oh, you are in over your head, pal. 
  General Kwon was meant to be a one-off. 
  Dan, I am standing here watching you run multiple operations. 
  Well, this was meant to be discreet. 
  Well, it didn't f*cking work, did it? 
  That's why I came to you. 
  To help me bring all of this back together. 
  All right, everyone, it's gonna be a long night. 
  Identify all of Yuri Leniov's holdings in Cyprus, please. 
  We can scramble a Ground Branch unit to intercept the warhead in Cyprus right now. 
  Where's Yuri Leniov? 
  Flight manifest shows him on a private jet from Seoul to Moscow. 
  Good. 
  We already have an asset in country. 
  Can we do a remote activation? 
  - Cell phone access? 
  - Confirmed. 
  This mean you're on board with the program, Ellen? 
  Not that you've left me much of choice, Dan. 
  Activating asset.
