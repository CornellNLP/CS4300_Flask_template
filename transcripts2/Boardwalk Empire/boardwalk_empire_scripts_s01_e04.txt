 Nucky : So what do you think, Chalky? 
 I can mix this up real nice. 
 500 bottles will get you 3000. 
 They put me out of business. How can I pay youse? 
 That's your problem, ain't it? 
 What are to be my duties, madame Jeunet? 
 You will assist the customers  when they try the garments on, n'est-ce pas? 
 You came to see Nucky. 
 I'm Margaret Schroeder. 
 Bully for you. 
 All right. 
 Who shot you? What'd he look like? 
 ( Screams ) 
 Good God, man. 
 Jimmy. 
 Fair-haired? 
 M-masks. Masks. 
 We lost him, sir. 
 Did he talk? 
 Sir, I have reason to believe  James Darmody was involved in the woods massacre. 
 You're through here, kid. 
 Where am I supposed to go? 
 Broadway limited going to Chicago, Illinois. 
 Nucky : It's an election year, Chalky. 
 This goes no further than here. 
 What happened is  this man was cheating with another fella's wife. 
 And the fella shot him.

You think it's funny? ( Al laughs ) Easy, Princeton. I was f*ckin' playing. I need the keys to the car. I can't hear out of my ear. Quit your bellyaching and go back to sleep. Man : What the hell's going on? It's okay. I'm okay. You're bleeding. What? Aw. This is never gonna work out. Nucky : What? No! Oh, come on, you shouldn't have. Now who planned this? Eddie : Nucky? Jesus! f*ck. How long you been standing there? I... very shortly. What do you want? I was rehearsing a speech. You asked to review the guest list for the party. Right, yeah. Well, let's hear it. Hank Adamo, Steven Mueller... I'm giving a speech next week to the restaurant workers association. What I was rehearsing. Yes. Richard Berman... I'm going shopping. Get something pretty. You know, you tore me apart last night. Jesus, Lucy. Make sure you invite governor Edwards. He will not come. I know. Despite that. Can you believe they elected that asshole democrat no-hoper? I booked suites for senator Edge and Mayor Hague. Visiting royalty... Edge especially. Hand me my shoes. Which ones? Ah. Make sure Edge gets the bigger suite. Mm-h. He's my ticket to that road appropriations money. Ja. Almost 30 million for Jersey alone. You cabet your keister I'm gonna get a piece of that pie. It's an expression... "a piece of the pie." Don't you have pie in Germany? We have strudel. Just make sure everybody gets laid. Edith : "Could it be the beautiful young woman found shivering in the river  is actually who she claims to be... the daughter of the czar of Russia,  the grand duchess Anastasia?" ( Teddy laughing ) It's like a fairy tale. "Was she assassinated at the hands of the Bolsheviks or did she masterfully escape the fate of her doomed royal family?" Teddy : Give me it. Emily : Mine. Emily : Give it to me! Pipe down or you'll get a spanking. There's no need for that now, is there? You spoil them. Look at this. ( Gasps ) "Anastasia Romanov, thought dead these past three years, could very well be the rightful identity of Anna Anderson, the amnesia victim now claiming to be the princess." Who's a princess? You are, my darling. And I'm the queen of england. Really? ( Edith chuckles ) Where's your sense of romance, Edith? It left along with my husband. Read the funnies, mama. Mind your manners. Please? All right, quickly. Then I've got to leave for work. Let's see what mischief mutt and Jeff have been up to. ( Hisses ) Soy. Does it hurt? A little bit. You should try some opium. There's den in Chinatown. Let me take you? I don't know. With all those hopheads? It's divine... it really is... for whatever ails you. ( Groans ) That fella Al... he can be really scary sometimes. He's all right. He's just from Brooklyn is all. Is that where you're from? Atlantic City. Mm. Star prairie, Wisconsin. Right, sure. Don't pretend like you ever heard of it. What's it like? Well, grandpa was the first white man born in town, pa was the first man got sent to state prison, and ma was the first woman run over flat by a car. So you could say I've got a lot to live up to. ( Chuckles ) I'll say you do. So did you really go to college? Where'd you hear that? Al's always calling you Princeton. Yeah, well where I come from,  some people had an idea about what I was supposed to be. Your pa? No. That's not something he'd do. There's a fella, kinda like... kinda like Torrio here. He saw me along through the years. That's... that's over with now. So what's your idea? Beg your pardon? About what you're supposed to be. Oh. That's a good question. Hmm. I looked at your book while you were sleeping. Yeah? What'd you think? I'm heading west myself, like the girl in the story... California, as soon as I save up. You're gonna be in the pictures? Gee, I don't know, maybe. Well, you're certainly pretty enough. Don't kid a kidder. You are. You're prettier than Lillian Gish. I'd watch you. ( Women giggling ) Would you save me from my brutish father? He's out of prison? Like Lillian Gish. "Broken blossoms"? I'd sure give it a shot. Well, then maybe I'll let you come with me. You'll let me? I might. How come? 'Cause I think you need taking care of. Nucky : What the f*ck is taking you so long? We've been trying, Nucky. It ain't like we haven't asked around. Asked around? You're trying to solve a murder, not find a lost cat. A cat would be easier. Nobody cares about some colored kid. Chalky cares, so that means I care. And you can bet your ass come election day you' gonna care too. Control Atlantic City, you control Atlantic county. Control Atlantic County... Control New Jersey, I know. If you know, then you'd know how much we need the colored vote. Like it or not, they're 20% of the city, Eli. And they vote the way he tells 'em to, so drink your damn coffee. They vote the way I tell Chalky to tell them. He drives a Packard, Nucky, because of you. He lives in a house bigger than the Mayor. You seriously think he'd ever risk all that,  let his people vote democrat? At this point, no. But there are limits to what he can sell those people, and a lynching's not one of them. If word got out... He needs you, Nuck. No one's ever gonna know. And we need him. One hand washes the other and both hands wash the face. Take a lot of suds to wash Chalky's face. ( Laughs ) You can wait in the hall. I don't like that fella. I never have. He's a good man, Halloran... ready and able. Just step it up, will ya? ( Music playing over radio ) Gillian, fix it. Let me see, darling. Gillian? You know most women are proud to be called grandma. Not while the peaches are still in season. I shouldn't be very long. Oh, take your time. I've got my man to keep me company. Say goodbye to mama. Bye, mama. Let's see here. Oh, they make such shoddy merchandise these days. You know when your daddy was a little boy, he had a blue tin train with big round wheels. A choo-choo. That's right, it was a choo-choo train. And it was a gift from one of my admirers. He was in the dry goods business. All better. What do you say? Thank you. Where's my kiss? Mwah! You are gonna break a million hearts one day. No. You know that? Run along now. There you go. ( Tommy chattering ) I just need to move it. ( Knocking at door ) Mrs. Darmody? Yes? I'm a friend of James. His friends call him Jimmy. So who are you really? I'm a what-do-you-call... an acquaintance from New York. That part I suspected. What's your name? Never mind my name. Is he here or ain't he? He's not. Then where is he? Maybe he's up your ass. Have you considered looking there? You got a fresh mouth for a broad. Maybe I need you to smack it for me, right? The roughneck bit... is that what the little girls are going for these days? Man : Filthy immigrants,  Christ-killing Jews,  anarchists of every stripe... ( Men murmuring ) ...Dangerous though they may be, make no mistake, my brethren, it is the coon  that is the true bane of our great nation. Up from the south they come like so many rats, It is our God-given right,  it is our Christian duty to eradicate this scourge... nobody move! Who's in charge here? State your name. Joseph Earl Dinler, Lose the dunce caps. You too, cyclops. You're the fella who owns the hardware store on Pacific. He sold me linseed oil not a month ago. If you're here to rob us, take what you will and leave with what little conscience you might have. Drop the act. You know who I am. You're a grafter, a whoremonger and a bootlegger. You're thinking of my brother. Let's go. You're under arrest. Everybody else stay in your seats. ( Men murmuring ) What's this about? Being in the Klan's not against the law. No, but stringing up darkies is. ( Grousing ) Yeah, we got our rights. You gotta be reasonable, huh? Mr. Sheridan says I can't be buying from nobody else. You're good then, 'cause we ain't nobody else. This is Johnny Torrio's territory now. You should talk to Mr. Sheridan, no? I don't know nothing. What do you mean you know nothing? You greeks... you got intelligence. I mean, you invented arithmetic, right? I don't know. Yes. Then you should know what happens next. See, I say you gotta buy from us, then you give me some lip, then the next thing you know... you all right, demo? Hey, you got something to say? ( Men whispering ) What happens now is I help you up. Ahh! But not really. Jimmy : Al. Please, why you do this? Al, come on. Come on what? I'm in the middle of a f*cking conversation. Next I break every bottle in this f*ckin' joint. Please, no! Good. These people look thirsty, so you'll want a big order when the truck comes around. Oh yeah, if Sheridan got a problem... Uh! ...You tell him to come see me. I'm at the four deuces over on Wabash. Are you staying for supper? ( Groans ) Demo, demo, are you all right? ( Whimpering ) Help me get him up. We have the pianist... the fat one. Remember you like him. Roast beef, rack of lamb, oysters on the half shell, lobster, and for the wine I have chosen a Chateau Margaux. The f*ck is this? What? This. This... f*cking lip Rouge. I will take care of it immediately. God f*cking damn it. I will see that they wash them twice. How hard do I work? The pressure I'm under... Is it too much to ask that if I have a simple goddamn birthday party that the silverware, the crystal... that they be clean? Nucky, I have taken... can I trust you to do anything right? The war, the anti-German bullshit... did I not stick with you despite all that? Yes, you... and this is the f*cking thanks I get? This filthy piece of sh1t that some whore left her cock-smeared lip Rouge on? Do you want me to drink from this? No. Do you want my guests to drink from this? No, of course not. ( Goblet thuds ) Eddie : You there, boy, scrub these goblets. Everything... ( sighs ) Please do your best. ( Door opens ) Morning. How'd you sleep? You Klan fellas... get you in front of a crowd, can't shut you up. In private though... I told you 100 times I don't know who hung that coon. Oh, I believe you. I ally do. The thing is though, I gotta be sure. What the hell are you doing? ( Door opens, closes ) Isabelle : Voila, madame. Enjoy. A la prochaine. Bonne soirée. Marguerite. Yes, madame Jeunet. I will require you this evening. You must stay. I'll need to make arrangements for the children. Rosalie... she did not have children. Yes, ma'am. Monsieur Thompson... tonight it is his birthday celebration. You will deliver to miss Danziger this dress, to Babette's, the nightclub. Miss Danziger? The paramour. What is it? The sweetheart of Mr. Thompson. Yes, of course. You will be there to Babette's by 10:00, and then you shall wait until after miss Danziger does the surprise. The silk fringe, the beading... it is very delicate, so you must assist her in putting it on. Very important. Yes, ma'am. You mentioned I must wait until after miss Danziger's surprise. What surprise is that? I don't know. This is why it is the surprise. Bonjour, madame. You wanna branch out, that's Jake with me, so long as it puts money in my pocket. But what I don't need at any price is a f*ckin' headache. I'm gonna straighten it out, I promise. How? By smackin' around bartenders for the next six months? This f*ckin' Sheridan is a pain in my ass. I'm gonna talk to him, John, soon as he gets here... work out an accommodation. Believe me, you're gonna be rolling in it. I'm going. I got a plantas wart on my foot. It hurts like a son of a bitch. You see that? 'Cause he knows I can handle it. Or maybe he actually has a plantar's wart. Don't be jealous 'cause I'm moving up, pal. I got big coattails. I move up, you're coming along for the ride. You got me all wrong. I'm just passing through. ( Bell rings ) It's them. Some free advice: You don't invade a country all at once. You take it over one piece at a time. ( Door opens ) Act nice, negotiate for a portion. ( Door closes ) A couple months you expand. Then before you know it, you're controlling his entire territory. Mr. Sheridan? Who the f*ck are you? Al Capone. This is Jimmy Darmody. Where the f*ck's Torrio? Mr. Torrio sends his regrets. He had some pressing business to attend to. What does he call this? He says you should talk to me. I gotta say this is very insulting. I come all the way down here in the snow. Trolley's ain't even running. Can we offer you anything? Some coffee, some whiskey? No. Forget California. Today I'm heading east. Chinatown. I'll see you later, okay? So how's the Greek fella? Probably at the dentist getting the shoe leather out of his chops. That fella gotta learn some manners. I'd say a lot of fellas do. What, are you talking about me, pally? Mr. Sheridan, we asked you down here to work out a compromise. The way that we see it, Greektown is big enough for all of us. You New York fellas make me laugh. You come out here from Brooklyn or wherever the f*ck and you act like you own the town. He's from Jersey. I don't give a f*ck where he's from, boyo. He's in Chicago now. Mr. Sheridan, I didn't mean any disrespect. The point is is that we have ambition... The point is this: You stay the f*ck out of Greektown or there's gonna be trouble. We're ready in Greektown, Sonny. We've been in Greektown since Colosimo took over. Maybe you didn't hear, but Colosimo retired on account of that bullet in his f*ckin' head. Johnny Torrio, also from Brooklyn... he runs things now and he's taking over your territory. And what? There's no room for negotiation? There might be. Well, how's about he take a piece of my action? How much? 10%. 25. All right, fine. Let's call it 50. 50? You heard me. I don't want any trouble, okay? Tell Torrio he gets what he wants. f*ckin' loudmouth. I knew he'd cave. That's one way of reading it. I was born in Elgin, Texas. My daddy taught himself the carpenter trade doing for the black folk there. And I tell you, anything that man put his hand to... table, chair, wedding chest... he make that wood sing. Now one day a man, Mr. T. O. Purcell, come round. He a white man, own his own store, a stable, hotel. He say to my daddy, "I hears you the finest carpenter in Elgin." My daddy tell him, "well, I can't say one way or the other, but I knows a bit about somethin'." So Mr. T.O. Purcell take my daddy to this house he was building... biggest house in town. They walk in there, say, "this here gonna be the library. What you think 'bout that?" My daddy say, "Well, I thinks you need some bookcases." "Well then, that's what I want you to make me." 10 month my daddy work there. And then when he finished, he bring me round. "Mr. Purcell, this here my boy. I'd like to show him what I done." "Well, come on in through the front door." Just like that. ( Snaps fingers ) And we did. When I seen them bookcases About a month later another man come round. "I seen what you did for T.O. I can't let that old dog top me. You come round my house and I'll show you what I need." My daddy go with him to the edge of town. Wasn't nothing there but six white men, 12' of rope, and the pepper tree they hung him from. These here are my daddy tools. What are you gonna do with them? Well... I ain't buildin' no bookcase. Stage manager: And now for your edification and enjoyment, we take you to ancient Rome. ( Men catcalling, laughing ) ( Wolf whistling ) ( Man speaking French ) Stage manager : Witness the ritual bathing of Aurelia, mother of the great emperor Julius Caesar. Behold her palace slaves who have no choice but to submit to her every imperial wish. ( Door opens ) 
 
 It wasn't the Klan. How do you know? He told me. And you believe him? There's a pot which if a man still sticks to his story, that's a man that's telling you the truth. We passed that point about 10 minutes ago. Crowd : Surprise! ( Cheering ) Oh my God! What? I had no idea. ( Band playing ) What do you tell a woman with two black eyes? Nothing. She's already been told... twice. ( Men laugh ) - Now that's one way to deny 'em the vote. I thought you were all for that, senator. I am... on the record. So long as they vote republican. We democrats fee the same way. May that never f*cking happen. ( Men laughing ) It is happening, boys. 32 states already ratified? Those suffragettes did their job. I think they all need a good rogering. Right, dearie? I know I do. It's nothing to be afraid of. You just gotta give 'em what they want. Who knows what that is? It doesn't matter. Women don't have the mind for politics. You're assuming they have minds at all. I have brains, you know. Buttercup... No no, let her speak. Lucy. Commodore : Let the little lady be heard. Please, angel, tell us your thoughts on the league of nations. The what? The... ( men laughing ) Nucky : The league of nations. There was a big meeting in Paris three weeks ago. Well, I don't know about that league thing, but Paris sure sounds swell. ( Women giggling ) You wanna take me, daddy? Now there's a thinking woman. Go get me a fresh one, okay? Okay, baby. Perhaps she's not the best example. ( Laughter ) Relax, will ya? I've been dealing with mugs like this my whole life. I asked around, Al. This Sheridan is a serious fella. No offense, but these micks... they come on strong, but it's just the booze talking. Now if they were Sicilian, they'd be a different story. Man : Gentlemen? We're ready for you. I gotta say thanks, pal. I know this can't be cheap. Springing for some new threads? Eh. Well, it's mighty white of you. A little fruity, but we're businessmen, right? Gotta look the part. You get that over there? The meuse-argonne. It's been killing me lately. Them heinies... cut us both up, huh? Lousy bastards. Right. The slim cut... very a la mode. That means "right on the money." The wide shoulders... a very masculine silhouette. What does the gentleman think? Wife's gonna sh1t. ( Laughing( Grunts ) ( Music playing ) Yes, please. Keep it coming. That's right. Mrs. Schroeder, welcome. Mr. Thompson. Happy Birthday. Oh, why thank you. Oh, I'm to deliver this gown to miss Danziger. Oh, of course. I'll put it in the dressing room for you. I trust Isabelle is treating you all right? Madame Jeunet? Yes, she is. Is that what she makes you call her? Well, there's the birthday boy. Enjoying yourself, Walter? I'll soldier on as best I can. May I present senator Walter Edge  up from Washington, and the honorable Frank Hague, Mayor of Jersey city? Gentlemen, Mrs. Margaret Schroeder. Mrs. Schroeder. Ma'am. A pleasure, I'm sure. Edge : May I get you a drink? Whiskey, gin? Thank you, no. I don't drink. Mrs. Schroeder is a member  of the women's temperance league. Oh. A fine organization. It is. Well, I guess I stepped in it, huh? ( Laughing ) You're not a suffragette, I hope. Not officially at least. Ah, another one, eh? I come from a country where women already have the right to vote. In fact, in most civilized countries  women are afforded that privilege. Well, in this country we're simply trying to protect women from the hard truths of life. By denying them the right to take a meaningful part in it? It's a shame you see it that way. Oh, it isn't just me, sir. It's most women who'd like the right to vote. And as you've learned, if you withhold from a woman something she deeply desires, then she'll surely find a way to withhold something that you desire. And what might that be? Alcohol. ( Laughter ) Well, now, they haven't done a very good job of it, now have they? Well now, the party's only just started. Walter, I think you've met your match. Mrs. Schroeder, I'll see you to the dressing room. Gentlemen. Ma'am. Man : Ladies and gentlemen, miss Edith day. ( Vocalizing ) I hope you're not offended by all the drinking. Old habits die hard. If they die at all. Well, that's a very practical perspective. I'm a very practical woman.

I forget her name. Pearl probably. Yes yes. That's her. Gotta face facts, Nuck... we have a democrat for governor now. These matters have to be finessed. And in the meantime, what? I lose my road money to Frank? People up north don't need roads? Actually, Frank, they don't. Relax, boys. There's plenty of dough for everyone. Well, I'll take mine now. There are limits, Nucky. Jesus. You can't expect to have everything. Is that what I told you when I put you in the governor's mansion? Nucky... And in the senate? Have I not thanked you enough? You were the best campaign manager I've ever seen... hell, that ever was... but you've got to understand this is complicated. I've got hotels that no one can get to except by stinking train because the roads to Atlantic City are rivers of f*cking mud. We need paved highways so cars can come and go. So cars can come and go... is that what you're worried about? And trucks. Trucks full of liquor. What's that, lemonade in your hand? I'm just proposing we call a spade a spade. Fine. How's this? You don't need the road money up north and you f*cking know it. The people of Jersey city need highways just as... Jersey city my balls. You're looking for a payoff so you'll back the f*ck away. So why not save us all time and give me a number? I'll need to do some calculations. Fine. Finally. You f*cking democrats, boy. Now now. Let's not let party politics affect what's best for the people. Jesus, Walter, have you packed for the white house already? ( Laughing ) - No, but when I'm there, maybe I can help you by controlling governor Edwards. "Maybe." Oh now, let's not let our best days be behind us, shall we? I'm through with this champagne. What's your pleasure, senator? I'll have a Pimm's cup. Eddie. I am so sorry. We have no Pimm's cup tonight. What do you mean? There is no Pimm's. Name anything else, senator. Well... I'll have a Brandy. Ja. Why, is there no Pimm's? Easy, will you? Like I said, you can't expect to have everything. Hmm? ( Chuckling ) You all set? What's your hurry? This ain't a love story, bub. You're nice, classy. You don't even seem like a whore. Thanks. Your friend there, Jimmy... he got good taste. I'll pass on the compliment. Come here. I gotta get back downstairs. Let me look at you. Something to remember you by. No kissing. No, I know. Jesus, you're like a f*cking angel. ( Screaming ) ( People screaming ) Yeah, okay. Come on, let's go. Man : You ready for tonight, huh? ( Woman giggling ) I need a pack of smokes and a paper. I'd have loved to have been there. I just didn't think you'd want this kind of news on your birthday. I don't want it the day after my birthday either. I didn't know he'd take that fella's finger, Nuck. Ahem. For your signature. Senator Edge ran up quite a bill. $1800? He said to thank you for a wonderful time. Eli : Do I return the Klan guy's ring? Or is that adding insult to injury? How's she doing? The doctor's given her a sedative. Can't I see her? She needs to sleep, kiddo. Is it bad? ( Sighs ) Go on. I'll put these in a vase. Cheer up. It happened to me. I'm still beautiful. It wasn't me made a muck of it. You dopes killed the wrong coon. He drives a Packard you said. But it wasn't Chalky. You hung a fella works for him. He got the message, didn't he? He probably crapped his drawers. Then why is he still operational? It was your idea in the first place. How should we know? Where's our dough anyways? I need a new topcoat. Which brother is this now? Teo. Teo, Leo, Ignacious. What are youse, all named after popes? What of it? You don't like God or somethin'? Whoa, take it easy. 7,000 clams, Mickey. Where's our f*ckin' money? Okay okay. I'll get it. From where? What do you say I get you a deal put three grand in your pockets? Yeah, I'm listening. Nucky Thompson. One of his ward bosses makes a nice fat collection by the Ritz every Friday. Nucky's joint? Nucky's money. It's candy from a baby, I tell ya. ( Giggles ) All right, you dope out a plan. But you botch it up, my brother's gonna give you a haircut you'll never forget. ( Door opens ) What's this? From Nucky Thompson. ( Chattering, giggling ) Waiting for someone? Yeah, actually. I've been waitin' to see you. Here I am. What do you want? Cat got your tongue? You've been following me around for days. You must have some idea. I think you already know what I want. No, dear. I only know what I want. Meet me here after the last show. ( Chattering, laughing ) Madame Jeunet? One minute. ( No audible dialogue ) Yes? What is it? Oh. I'm done. 9:00 A.M. tomorrow for inventory. Yes, ma'am. Good evening, madame Jeunet. Bonne soirée.
