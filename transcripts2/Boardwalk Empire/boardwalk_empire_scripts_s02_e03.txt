 Nucky :  I've made inquiries, Harry. 
 Heard good things about you from judge Graves. 
 You mean you heard I play ball. 
 Well, don't you? 
 The babe's got nothing on Harry Daugherty. 
 Buying from Canada, John? Makes sense. 
 Who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway Go see Nucky. Tell him things things have changed. 
 I have your money. 
 Come lay with me, daddy. 
 You need to sleep in your own room. 
 Margaret :  Mr. Thompson? 
 Mr. Thompson's been arrested. 
 I'm very sorry, ma'am. 
 May I use the facilities? 
 Nucky Thompson's about to hit seven years of lean. 
 Which leaves us the booze. 
 Commodore :  With my solid tie to the coast guard,  what we ship comes in; what Nucky ships doesn't. 
 I tried talking to 'em. 
 All they see is the dollar signs. 
 I'm Owen Sleater. I'm to ensure your home is safe for Mr. McGarrigle's visit this evening. 
 I make you from the lonesome west. 
 Kerry. 
 Family there still? 
 No. Here, apparently. 
 Jimmy :  If you're in the market for quality liquor, 
 I can get it for you. 
 And Nucky Thompson? 
 Nucky's like a father to me. 
 I'll show you out. 
 My man there-- he'll be staying on in the States. 
 I mentioned that you might be able to help him out. 
 Bring him around tomorrow. 
 Cash me out. 
 What was that? 
 Representatives of Mr. Masseria. 
 Just give us the jack. 
 (Knife slices) 
 (Gurgling) 
 The ledger book-- it's missing. 
 And some cash. 
 Where did you get those? 
 From your closet today. 
 This must be burned and future dealings committed to memory.

She invited us for dinner. She came here? Well, it's not like we've got a phone. I asked you not to allow anyone in here. I pay you for it. A simple dinner, some conversation,  some music, for God's sake. They have a VV-80. I don't know what that is. A Victrola. You don't hear Jolson from across the alley?

Please make sure you eat. (Tearfully) Say what you want about Nucky,  at least  he  was fun. ♪ Does she? I'll say she does. ♪ (Birds chirping) (Footsteps approaing) I've had Katy return a few of my things to the Belle Femme. The brocade coat, the flower pendant necklace-- What? What for? I don't need them. But you wanted them. Under the circumstances I thought it might be wise to conserve our resources. Under the circumstances it's more important than ever for it to appear as though nothing has changed. Are you not invested to the limit in your land deal? I heard you on the telephone with your lawyer. I want you only in your finest things. I sleep late, you know that. I said nothing. These are, after all, your finest silk pajamas. Send the girl to get your things back. We'll be fine, Margaret. We are fine. f*ckin' chinamen last night-- spilled coffee all over the felt. You let chinks play in here? What's this? It's light, I know. Light? It's a f*cking dirigible. You're gettin' a lot of use out of that line, I bet. What am I supposed to tell Nucky? Tell him I don't know. But you can ask him why I had to hire this Mick  when I ain't got no booze to sell. You're evading the issue, Lolly. Let me tell you about the casino business, Damien. People gamble. They lose; they get mad, so we give 'em free drinks so they keep gambling. Sometimes they win; they get happy, so we give 'em more free drinks. Then they're drunk; so they gamble even more and eventually they lose it all. The next night they come back and do it all over again. So the whole f*cking equation depends on what? Alcohol. You just got a load last month! Of the cheap sh1t, the swill, and I'm even running low on that. The rollers want the good stuff. We ain't got it, they play someplace else. It's hard, Lolly. Nuck's fighting for his life. We're all fightin' for our lives. He wants fat envelopes? I'm gonna need the booze from him. Or from somebody else. Commodore : Same route, same order. Eli : Hell, it's even the same fellas meeting you on shore. It's a passing of the mantle. Sure. Back to the fella already passed it to Nucky. I'll be buying my liquor somewhere, captain. Might as well be from Bill McCoy. So it's not so much you want to buy from me as you don't want me selling to Nucky. That needn't concern you. Ah, but the enemy of my friend... I believe you have that backwards, Mr. McCoy. Commodore :  Feeling flush, are you? God bless Mr. Volstead. Halibut and motor oil, that's what he used to smell like. Now he's a f*cking big shot. Your attempt at charm, Lou? My attempt to talk sense to a jackass. I thought you made a deal, you and Nucky, years ago. Didn't like the terms. So he bested you in the bargain and now you're f*cking him over. Let's keep the conversation civil, huh? Just politics, Bill. Mccoy :  Or mutiny,  depending which business you're in. Giving me the stink eye for? Captain? That lighthouse out there, the beacon that guides you? Don't you forget who put it there. That scotch in your hand that warms your winter nights? Don't you forget who put it there. Now what? Commodore :  Get on the phone. Get Tony Dennehy at the coast guard. Nucky, I am so sorry. I was watering the plants. He let himself in. Who did? Mr. Thompson. Torrio's man. Al Capone. Right. Brew some coffee. Immediately. I was not expecting you until later. No excuses, just coffee. Ja. I'm sorry for barging in. It's been a busy time. I haven't been able to get the maid in here lately. My office is in a cat house. What brings you to Atlantic City? A message from Johnny Torrio. He wanted you to hear it personally. So he sends you. I was coming this way anyhow. My father died. I'm settling his affairs. He got a barbershop over-- What's the message? With regret, Chicago will no longer be buying alcohol from Atlantic City. Look, whatever Mr. Torrio may have heard about my position here, you can assure him that all is well. Meaning what exactly? That I'd expect a man of his caliber not to cut and run at the first sign of trouble. I don't know what you're talking about. Truth is this is nothing personal. Torrio's got a new supplier. Well, did I say that? Don't get cute. New York? Philly? Is it Waxey Gordon? Unless he's getting out of the liquor business entirely I'm gonna find out. He ain't. So is he distilling it from lake Michigan, what? You're getting warmer. Some Jews across the lake, they're shipping it direct. Canada? With your pal George Remus in Ohio. He knew you'd be taking a hit-- a token of goodwill. What should I tell him? Tell him no thank you. Next time he has something to tell me in person, I'd like to hear it in person. Fair enough. How's Jimmy Irish? If you're referring to Jimmy Darmody, you'll have to ask him. He's movin' up in the world, eh? Tough out there, Chicago? The liquor trade? It's tough all over I'd imagine. There's a lotta dough at stake. How's Torrio handling the competition? We're killin' 'em. Lucy :  Did you have trouble finding me? Why, I asked a fella for directions, he said, "leave town and don't look back." Oh no! (Vocalizes) The good stuff, straight from Broadway. It was a joke, peaches. I was kidding. Ocean city's fine. It's not that. It's just seeing you reminds me of everything I'm missing. Missing? You're not missing a thing, kid. A baby, that's the ticket. I tell you, Ida and the girls make life worth living. Papa, whoever he is, oh, wait till he gets a load of that kisser. He's married. Mr. Mueller? Who? The name on the mailbox. That's not his name. He's some prohi I met in a speak. You met a prohi in a speak? Ohh. After Nucky threw me over, I didn't care. I wasn't careful. Then the next thing I knew... He said he'd pay me-- good money. Take care of me until the baby comes. You should've written you were short on dough. No, it's just... Oh, it's just that I wanted to-- be important to somebody. I wanted... I wanted to mean something besides just whoopee. You know? Does Nucky know? He knows about everything else,  I wouldn't be surprised. So tell me about Vaudeville. What's the gossip? You mean besides you? We're dead for winter and MacGregor's coming into the Apollo with this snoozer. A showgirl wants to marry a society boy but his parents won't-- (Snores) Is it that bad? Huh huh? What? Oh. It's not  that  terrible I suppose. Hmm. "A dangerous maid." (Man singing in Italian) Ange? (Singing continues) (Laughing) Daddy! Jimmy. Al :  Here they are, Mutt and Mutt. What are you doing here? Hey. (Grunts) Thank heavens. Hey, watch the lamp! (Laughing) Tommy, get him, get him! Get him! (All laughing) Get him! Tommy, c'mere. All he's gotta do is step aside. Naturally. Like Colosimo. Bang! (Chuckles) That's not how we're working it. It's a political coup. A what? We're taking back the city. My father used to run things here. f*ck the city. What about the booze? We got it all locked up. We got the coast guard in our pocket and Nucky will be in jail by fall. Jail? Just have Frankenstein drill a hole in his noggin. (Laughs) I won't do that. Whaddaya mean won't? So how about you? You still at the deuces? Torrio gimme a piece. The brewery too-- 20% of each. I bought a house. I'm movin' my brothers out from Brooklyn. So we're both cooking with gas. Salute. Salute. I wish I knew you were coming. I would have baked something myself. No, this is great.  Perfecto. Angela :  Are you staying for dinner as well? Nah, I got a train for Brooklyn. My father passed a few weeks back. I'm settling his affairs. Oh, I'm sorry. He was a barber, had his own shop. Not like your father, but he did okay. Thought I'd be a barber too. (Laughs) Can you see that? It's an honest living. And it worked him to death like a chump. But he was my father, right? (Speaks Italian) (Speaks Italian) I marry a Mick, you marry a dago and we both got sons. What's that about? Tommy :  Daddy, my shoes won't tie. What? My shoes won't tie! I'll be right back. They won't tie, huh? Uh-uh. You don't remember what I showed you? Watch daddy's leg. Tommy :  Looped. Loop, okay. Wrap, put it through, pull it tight. Like that? Yes. Okay. Looped, wrap it around-- one? Two? No, one loop. Two loops? No, one loop! Three loop. Then-- wrap it around. No. How is odette? Who? Tommy :  Put the string in-between. In-between. And pull tight. Pull it tight. She's a whore. That's how she is. Jimmy :  You know how to do it better than I do. You just like-- you just like it when I do it. (Kids laughing) Daddy, daddy! Hey hey! Daddy, daddy, daddy! I need your help. (Kids clamoring) Can I just get my coat off at least? Your father's agitated or something. He won't let me shave him. Change his bed. Leave him be, he's comfortable. It's days now he's sleeping in his clothes. He'll get bedsores. (Kids clamoring) Hey, pop. Time to go to sleep. Look who's here-- the big shot. Come on, let's get you changed, okay? Here, this bullshit. What they're trying to do? You shouldn't read that. Here. It's a lot of goddamn bullshit. I know. What? Let's get you cleaned up, okay? I gotta be ready in case he needs me. Who? Your brother! Well, to do that you're gonna need your rest, okay? So here, come on. What'll become of him? He's a big boy, pop. He'll take care of himself. Aw bullshit. Pop, c'mon. Quit squirming. You need to help him. You can handle things, but Eli? He has no goddamn idea what he's doing. Mr. Thompson. Good night. You're up. I am. How was your day? It was good. Chalky white's gonna make bail. He'll be home very soon. Oh. His family must be thrilled. You all right? I'm fine. You look... I don't know. The book maybe. So are you going to tell me what's going on or not? Is it only me who has to share their troubles? What do you mean? You walk around, the weight of the world on your shoulders, yet you pretend nothing's wrong. I'll do the worrying for the both of us. I want to help you. You do. You are. I've told you of my brother and sisters in Ireland. Yes? They're here now, in Brooklyn. There's a resemblance. There's a telephone number. What are you going to do? I don't know. It wasn't a happy parting of the ways. This business, when it all blows over? I'd like to take you away. Have you seen Paris? (Laughs) No. Then that's where we'll go. The kids too if you like. We'll book a suite at the Meurice. I'm quite happy here, you know. I'm very glad to hear that. But it's important to always have something to look forward to. The whole encounter will be balanced on a razor. Take your father's lead, but be your own man as well. So I shouldn't let him cut my meat for me? I'm glad you're so cavalier. It's just a dinner, ma. With the governor, dear. Your father's worked very hard to solidify this relationship. And you know what they say about first impressions. You used to call him "The Letch." Who? My father. I did not. You did. I had to look it up. Well, it must have been when I was still angry with him. And what's changed? I grew up. I learned forgiveness. It is a virtue, you know. By that logic I should forgive Nucky. Forgive Nucky for what? Nothing. It means everything that you stood up for my honor, dear. I was a mere child when Nucky brought me to your father. You were certainly right about that. What's with his hair? Getting old is no picnic, believe me. It looks foolish. To you, maybe. To the outside world he just looks like the commodore. A friend of mine buried his father. He was a barber. Oh? Sometimes I think I'd be better suited to a simpler life. Well, that's ridiculous. You're a natural leader. And what are you? I'm just a woman who loves her family. "I know what everybody says about me behind my back." That I'm just some flibbertigibbet with cotton wool between the ears. Well, I'm wise to a thing or two, I guess. You think I'll fall for any old bean with pomade in his hair and the keys to a coupe. And maybe I would have last month, but now I'm in love with Harry. So what if I don't know how to hit a ball with a stick on a horse, or laugh without showing my teeth? I love him and he loves me. And whether we wind up in some swank mansion or just in a tarpaper shack--" What are you doing? Nothing. Please. What is this? What's it look like? A script. Why were you reading it? My friend Eddie came over today--  Eddie Cantor. He's a performer. I've seen his name. What did you discuss? Only that there's a musical trying out in town. And he thinks-- Eddie--  he thinks I'd be good for the part. A chorus girl. In the story she's a chorus girl who gets jammed up with the wrong guy. Everything written here is what the actors are supposed to say? (Snorts) Ain't you ever seen a show? Hey, give that-- 
 
 I was taken by an aunt to a Christmas pageant in 1894. When my parents found out, they broke off all relations and never spoke to her again. Well, you don't know what you're missing. You wish to appear in this spectacle? (Mumbles) Please speak up. Yes! Yes, I wish to appear. I need something, something or I'm going to go crazy. But you realize that's not possible. You're carrying a child. That is a sacred charge from the lord and a financial agreement between us. So what  you  might want can't be allowed. (Sobbing) (Door slams) I'm sorry. (Organ music playing) (Laughter) I told him, Nuck. I hollered and everything. And he said what? That without the hooch, people don't gamble as much. We got three boats coming in tonight-- scotch, rum and rye. Tell him to keep his shirt on. The Attorney General is on the line. This isn't to be critical, but you need to start picking up on people's signals. Okay, Nuck. I need to take this call, Damien. Right. Yes, I'm so sorry. So sorry. Mr. Attorney General. (Laughs) Why so formal? The only thing new is the title. How are you settling in, Harry? Warren had to have the place fumigated. Seriously, the White House? It's filthy. Not nearly as dirty as when you fellas get through with it. (Laughs) What can I do for you, Nuck? Well, speaking of messes, I'm in one myself. You hear about this election nonsense they're throwing at me? I read the papers, sure. At least my clerk does it for me. Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but if you were ever planning on making good on a certain debt,  now would be the time. Hey, you leave a case of wine on top of a radiator? Come on. What? Sorry, Nuck. I say I'm calling in a favor. I heard you, I just... I don't know. You don't know what? I hope it's how to thank me and not whether a b*st*rd kid would've cost your boy the election. Don't get me wrong, Nucky, we're all very grateful, but yours was a state election. So? So I have no standing to intervene on a federal level. You can't get Harding to pull some strings? Tell you what, how about you come down for a visit? My guest, you and your gal, dinner at the White House, stay over if you'd like. I know Warren would love to see you. How does that sound? It sounds like you're f*cking me over. Let me unpack my socks at least, will you? Swell, Harry. In the meantime I'll try to stay out of jail. Meyer, Charlie, I believe you know Mr. Masseria. Sure. Everybody knows Joe the boss. Then perhaps you also know, though it is of course news to me, that a card game you operate is located in territory that Mr. Masseria considers to be his. Not considers! Is mine. My thinking was, before any more blood is shed, that a compromise can be reached. More blood? Tompkins Square Park, my two nephews? I don't know what you're talking about. Apparently two of Mr. Masseria's emissaries to your establishment were murdered shortly after their visit. We do operate a game in what might be termed a grey area territorially. But as to any violence in the neighborhood-- they stab themself, eh? A coincidence then. It happens. On my streets no coincidence. This little prick, since he's 10 years old he causes problems. It seems to me you boys ought to extend a token of goodwill towards Mr. Masseria. Shall we say  a one-time fee of $2,000 for the families of those gentlemen and a tax of 10% on the game going forward? Hold on a f*ckin' second-- Charlie. 10% is okay. For now. Then we have an agreement? (Speaking Italian) (Table rattles) Charlie. (Snorts) A.R., two grand is bad enough, but 10% of the f*cking game? We already pay half the take on that game to you. Yes. And now you boys know why. There's another speak off Baltic. Right time of night, you'll be good for 100 cases. What kind of security, Mr. Cusick? The usual-- shotguns, pistols. And the name is Doyle now. Your file says Cusick. Then it's wrong, 'cause I already been arrested under the new moniker. I can arrest you again if you like, see if it sticks. Cusick'll be dandy. Cash up front, officer. You wanna dance, you pay the piper. (Giggles) Any chance you wanna sell back any hooch you might happen to confiscate? Are you admitting to me that you're a bootlegger, Mr. Cusick? (Giggling) Jesus, I can't get a bead on you. So that's what you like. Can't fault you there. I'm a married man. I have no interest in women of that sort. "Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen." (Giggling) That's what my Uncle Louie used to say. Let me ask you, Mr. Doyle-- would you consider Nucky Thompson fun? (Lucy sobbing) For whom should I ask? Any occupant of apartment 2A. I don't often speak on the telephone, ma'am. Just relax. I told you what to say. Uh, hello. Yes. Any occupant of apartment 2A, please. Yes, very good. He'll fetch someone. Is it a friend you're loing for? A relation. In America? Are they-- Yes, hello. I am attempting to locate miss Peggy Rohan. And I wondered if I m-- Yes, I see. And you're quite sure of this? I'm terribly sorry. A second man-- the man the first man went to fetch? He says-- I'm sorry, but he says Peggy Rohan is dead, ma'am. He said she died 12 years ago. (Man clears throat) Mayor Bader dropped by. He invited you to join him and Mrs. Bader for dinner. Tell him I'm busy. Anything specific? Just make something up. Ja. Oh! I was wondering why the phone had not rung. Just leave it. (Knocks) Mr. Thompson, I do hope I'm not intruding. What do you want? A word, if you've time, sir. Have a seat. (Clears throat) Thanks. As you know, sir, I've-- and I'm eternally grateful-- I've been tending bar for Mr. Steinman at the casino there. Tonight. Sir? The booze. There's a shipment tonight. Yes sir. That's actually not why I'm here. Why are you here? What's your name again? Owen Sleater. I'm here, sir, 'cause I read the papers. More importantly I read between the lines. And you've concluded what? That my talents are being wasted behind a tap. (Phone ringing) What are your talents, Mr. Sleater? Making people stop. Stop what? Whatever it is you don't want them to be doing. What makes you think I need a man with those skills? Well, if you need me to tell you, sir, you need me more than I thought. Nucky, I just received a call. A ship-to-shore message from Bill McCoy: The coast guard is seizing his ships. I thank you for your time, sir. (Sobbing) (Sobbing) (Door opens) Man :  Hello? Hello? Hello. Delivery for Mueller. So you set the record. You wind her up. You place the needle... (Music playing) ...And you're all set. Mmm. Excuse me. Who sent this? That would be Mr. Mueller. (Sighs) (Laughs) The girl's being coy with you, Lilian. Katy : Oh yes, him. "Oh yes, him," she says. I saw the way you looked at him. We both did. You were giddy as a schoolgirl-- Is this a private party? Ma'am, I'm so sorry. Sit. Pour me a drink. More for yourselves as well. Are you sure, ma'am? It's the first drop kills you. So there's no harm in the last. Were you born in Ireland, Katy? No, ma'am. Here, ma'am. Please stop calling me that. If you had been, you'd have left the place. And far be it from anyone to begrudge you that escape. Am I right? Yes, ma'am-- missus. Margaret. Why put on airs? If you wish. What's this? Leave it. What's the matter? Nothing. I'd like you to dress for dinner. What? Get dressed, please. I'm taking you out. ♪ Like a sweet cooin' dove ♪

Oh, after you, my dear. Hey, you son of a bitch. Louis, how are you? How are you? Good to see you. Shake hands with my son Jimmy. A pleasure. Sir. Governor Edwards, sit down. I took the liberty of ordering you a little appetizer. Don't look so uncomfortable, Ed. You're not the biggest crook I've been seen in public with, Louis wish I could say the same about you. (Governor laughs) Are we shocking your youthful sensibilities? I've heard worse, sir. Jimmy went up against the kaiser for two years. Oh, that's a rough patch of road. That was only war. This is Atlantic city. (Men chuckle) Well done, boy. Well done. Nucky. Good evening. It is. Four please. I wasn't expecting you. I'm sorry. It's fine. Relax. Let's go to the Blenheim. We're eating here. Governor :  Ah, so you intend to follow in your papa's footsteps? I'd like to think I'm my own man. I wouldn't have it any other way. But I am eager to learn everything I can. Yeah? What have you learned so far? Nothing's free. You know, I never thought Volstead was a good idea. You will after you open that envelope. The partisan nonsense it caused. You and I will be a lot closer, Ed. Republicans, democrats-- all f*cking meaningless as soon as Nucky Thompson is-- when he's brought to justice. Right. We'll have a gala f*cking party. I'll be looking forward to it. (Laughter) Commodore :  I love this kid. I'd be happy to eat elsewhere. Didn't someone mention the Blenheim? Any questions about the menu? I think we're all set. The lady will have the veal chop. I'll have the rib-eye. Very good, sir. Mr. Thompson? Lobster thermidor for the lady. Center-cut pork chops for me. I'm so sorry, sir, we're just out of the lobster. No. My apologies. Not a minute ago. What would you recommend? We have chicken cordon bleu or a poached salmon. The chicken then. (Diners gasp) Jimmy :  Nuck.  - You've had your last meal in this place. Nucky. Get your f*cking hand off me. Governor, what brings you to our seaside resort? You have my sympathy for your troubles, Nucky. And you have my undying wish for a long political career. You're looking very respectable, James. Meet his eyes, boy. I'd say we're both putting up a pretty good front. What did he promise you? More than you ever did. I keep my promises, James. And I'll make you one now: I will ruin you. All of you. You act more like a f*cking child. You're the expert on children, aren't you? He never even asked her name. Just pointed to the one he wanted. The rest was understood. Commodore : Jimmy! Hey hey hey! You're stronger than that. Jimmy. Have a nice dinner, gentlemen. Jimmy. Lolly :  No no no, wait. Scratch that. Better yet, give me 10 rum, then 20 each of the rye and whiskey. Owen : Hey, peddle your goods elsewhere. We'll not be needing your services. The f*ck you talkin' about? We work for Mr. Thompson. These are not Mr. Thompson's men. You want this order or not? He does not. Take you for a soldier, lad. I was. Ah. And who is it you're fighting for now? Right. Back on the truck now, like good lads. I don't take orders from no f*ckin' paddy. Of course you don't. This is America. Why did you not shoot me? I may yet. I've got no quarrel with you, sir. We're just not buying any liquor. (Coughs) ♪ In the evening by the moonlight ♪
