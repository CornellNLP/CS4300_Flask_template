 The world series was months ago, lawyer Fallon, and the horseshit hasn't dried yet.

Brothers, the lord knew that fairness was not something to be parceled out by those in power like so many crusts of bread! The lord knew that decency and fairness to those who served faithfully that they too Amen. Amen! (Shouting) So that the strong and the weak shall know each other. Amen. And know the truth. That the strong are not as mighty  as they may think. And the weak-- have mercy-- not as feeble as they may appear. The lord knew that civility was not just an accommodation. The lord knew, in his infinite wisdom, that decency and fairness was a solemn Christian duty to those... (Muffled shouting continues) Are you the man to see? Unless there's someone else in here with his thumb in his ass. Striker :  We're not moving! Nucky Thompson sent me. I thought he hung 'em up. A man can't have a hobby? There's not a lot of call for oats at the moment. (Scoffs) Strikers :  We got children at home we go to feed too! There where would those profit! Fancy places be without us? That real? Straight from the old girl's tit. Strikers :  Y'all can afford to pay us 10 cents more. $30 a case, it's less than half the going rate. We want fair wages! We work just as hard. Who's gonna serve it? They'll be back. Are you an expert on labor relations? I know what an empty stomach feels like. Strikers :  We're gonna stay out here as long as it takes. Owen :  Someday this  strike will end, sir. And so will our deal on this fine Irish whiskey. Strikers :  We're gonna stay on strike till they treat us fair. We'll stay together... Get me 400 cases. (Wind chimes ringing, distant dog barks) You seem quite at home with this. Ja,  being the oldest of seven children, it's always been. My mother tells the story of how when I am six, I try to feed my baby sister through my bosom. I wish I had milk for you. (Abigail coos) Ja,  I do. Ja, I do. (Clears throat) There's some money for groceries. Some shortbread cookies would-- when did this me? Why didn't I get this? Yesterday. I leave it for you there. I am to receive all correspondence from Mrs. Van Alden immediately. Ja. I-- I thought you see it. (Abigail fussing) Oh, come on. (Abigail wailing) Shhh. Give the burp for to me. Shhh. (Wailing continues) (Paper crumples) Shhh. Mrs. Schroeder. Mr. Thompson. Dr. Holt It's nice to see you. This is Theodore. What do you say? How do you do, sir? How is she, doctor? Sleeping. Bit of a rough patch-- nausea and such. Why did no one ring me? I would've stayed the night. I know how hard this is for you, but she's in good hands here. She'll need your love and patience later on. Later when? You can go on in if you'd like. Come on, slugger. But very quiet. Little cat feet. Her lungs are sound. Nerves to the heart and upper limbs seem unaffected. But the damage to her legs could be extensive. Will she be crippled? At this stage it's impossible to say. I've seen children worse than her make a complete recovery. Mr. Thompson is a man of means. If there's anything to be done-- wish it were as simple as money. The are things that are out of our control, much as I want to tell you otherwise. Little girl? She's nine. She says a prayer for these kids every night. She doesn't know them. I never taught her to do it. You're meant to ask God to intercede for other Holt:  I've always found it hard not to a for myself. We'll get the results from the latest test by Friday Go in and see your daughter. Woman :  Okay, dear, come on. Right leg first. There you go. Now isn't that getting easier? Good boy. Good morning, my darling. How are you feeling? All right. We missed you so much. And look what I brought. What happened to miss Wheatley? This is miss Wheatley's sister. She's here to visit and she insisted on seeing you. Here. Aww. Do you like her lovely curly  hair Is it like yours? Nucky : Your hair's prettier. (Margaret chuckle) She's very pretty. (Nucky imitates doll) Hi, Emy. Margaret :  See her lovely bow? How nice. (Music playing) Man :  Hey, bring it over here! Man 2 :  Harvey, that box? Step on it. Jesus. Easy. We're not making popskull here. Hiya, boys. Checking up on your investment? Yeah, try not to lose this batch. (Mickey giggles) "Property of the U.S. government." Not anymore, it ain't. To George Remus. (Al cackles) So how long? We're halfway done. A week around the clock will take care of the rest. That's too long. I just got the 10 guys. Hire 50. You got those spooks marching on the boardwalk, pinch a few of them. Chalky will love that. I didn't say ask his permission. I gotta unload this stuff, get home. f*ckin' Torrio's on my ass Rothstein's sniffing around too. He knows something's up. Yeah, we all got business, right? Mickey : There's Manny Horvitz too. Yeah, what about him? He's running a special on lips and assholes this week. What do you think? f*ckin' pay him already. Cash? Booze, whatever. He's Waxey Gordon's problem now, not mine. Luciano : Darmody, hold up I been wanting to show you something. What are youse looking at? Get back to work. You can sniff it, smoke it or inject it. Nice, Sal. You moving chink drugs now? It ain't hop, it's heroin. And I wouldn't think a whoremeister'd pass judgment. (Chuckles) - Meyer: Heroin delivers a higher dose of opiates to the brain than opium-- which makes for a happier customer. No bottles, no barrels. A million bucks in a suitcase. What's the bank? Huh? Who's gonna buy it? You got your artist types, people uptown. I seen this one-- How many? Their numbers may be very small right now, but they're very enthusiastic. Here-- get a few samples out to the local All right, that's great. But before you start squawking again, how about getting this out the locals? I don't know what tell you, Nucky. I'm extremely disappointed. Okay, try that again. Only this time leave out the part where you sound like my mother. This Esther Randolph, she's relentless. The trial  will  be in Camden. I've made calls-- You've made calls? Worth every penny. Daugherty? Says he did what he could; that you two are square. Your desk ready for use. You hear that, Nicky? My desk which used to be in my suite when I ran the f*cking city-- is ready for use. Is there gonna be anything else? No. Thank you, Harlan. Mr. Thompson. Now why don't you tell me what you have in mind  to keep this trial in Atlantic county, where I can work the judge and jury? Medical hardship. You mean this? This wouldn't even stop me from jacking off! You'll get five years. You'll be out in two-- Eddie! Call those two Guinea anarchists from Massachusetts. Tell them to relax, I've found them a new lawyer. The difference being with Sacco and Vanzetti that innocence is still a possibility. Did you want something? Get the f*ck out. I was talking to you. I realize that. Good. Then you should also realize you're fired. (Sighs) 300 empty rooms, 500 pounds of peaches darker than the help and a tourist season that's slipping through my fingers. And why? Because no one here  can get the colored situation under control. It should've been dealt with a month ago.  like your father dealt with Chalky White. I don't want to owe the klan on this one. They got the job done. You do you think we're this mess to begin with? Man :  Because these jigaboos all think they're Moses. Half them are named at away. (Mumbling) No no. No! Jimmy : It's all right. Don't get worked up. He's trying to speak. God damn it. The-- I'll take care of it. Okay, pop? Yes? You're going to negotiate. What? Settle it, get back to business. Ed! Hear him out, Dan. Nickel raise across the board. Are you saying you can't afford it? Nobody ever does that, kid. It's nothing compared to what you're losing. And next year? The year after that? Where will it end? Memorial Day, people come; Labor day, people go. That's what we've got. That's where we make money. We give in to them now-- No! No. (Commodore stammers) Gentlemen, my father needs to rest Please. Jimmy... Stammering continues) Do what we're paying you to do -- End this. I think you're handling this in the right way No, you don't. 50 guys with billy clubs. Neary : That's the ticket. Are you serious? How do you think these things get handled? Look what happened back in '09-- the steeplecase? Tossed 'em straight off the pier. "Look, mammy, I swimming!" (Laughs) I'm not starting a riot. Eli :  There won't be one. They're in, they're out; Shines get something to chew on. Right, commodore? Neary :  Who's your man out there? Halloran's on it. Neary :  Old raging Ray? What's that mean? Nothing. I had another heart-to-heart Ray? With our lovely lady lawyer last week,  saw him sitting out there with his guts in a knot. I told him not to talk to her. I tell him, "Ray, whatever she asks about the election,  just say Nucky made you do it. Take your lollipop and go home." Sure, that's how you swing it. Neary :  Jeez. Some people, huh? You're intending to follow this strategy? Which one? The billy clubs or throwing them at the pier? I can't choose. Your predecessor knew how to keep the colored happy. All right. This is what we got. I'm not Nucky, ok? Now at we got that out of the way, let's figure how to end this peaceful-- Why don't you just show 'em your c**t? What? You heard me. Why don't you just-- lift up your dress and let yourself get f*cked? Get me a f*cking drink. Yes sir, commodore. Teddy :  When I lay down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, pray the lord my soul to take. Shall we say a special prayer for Emily? And please make my sister Emily get better. Good night, sweet prince. Mama? Yes dear? I can't move my legs. What? I can't move my-- Can you feel that?! No. (Giggling) (Wailing) You were just praying. (Crying continues) God help me, but he's got his father's cruelty. He just wants attention. His sister's lying crippled in the hospital. He knows that. Not the same as understanding. What am I to do? Abandon my sick baby girl to attend my healthy son? Before anything else you're to stop running yourself ragged. I have to be in New York tomorrow. Just for the day. I'll take Teddy with me. It'll give you a chance to rest. What will you be doing there? Hiring a new lawyer. You can't leave him alone. I won't. And please see that he brushes his teeth. Okay. And make sure that he keeps his fingers from his nose. It's a revolting habit ♪ but then the Holy Spirit ♪ 
♪ revives my soul again ♪

 In Gilead ♪

 Hold them on! Woman : Oh my God! ♪o al the s-sick soul. ♪ No no! (Screaming, grunting) Mr. Thompson. I've heard only good things. Not from me, of course. Well, at certainly narrows down the list of suspects. You like baseball? Yes. Ty Cobb signed this. Now it's yours. What do you say, Teddy? Ty Cobb is a bad man. He doesn't like to be crossed, at for sure. But if your team's down, he's the guy you want at bat. Now go on, kiddo. Come on, Teddy. How about a nice glass of milk? So your case-- Arnold tells me you'd like to go in a new direction. Preferably away from jail. This Ginsburg you had defending you...  he's lost his main focus or something he does when he's not shoeing horses? I hope the meter's not running. I'd hate to think I'm paying to hear what fool I am. That part's on the house. Once you get past Mr. Fallon's charm, I think you'd find him quite effective. Can you get the venue changed back to Atlantic City? Probably not. But if there's a seed of dot to be sown on your behalf, I am quite effective with juries. And all this farming will set me back what? $80 per hour. Which also buys you my uncanny ability to make friends with judges. And if I told you I had no money for bribes? Then you'd be relying solely on my legal acumen. What would you do, Arnold? No one likes a long shot more than a gambler. (Distant traffic, music playing) (Knocks (Mumbling) Come in. Eli. Fresh peas, from June's garden. What do I do with them? Have your landlady boil 'em up. How you feeling? How do you think? Yeah. What happened out there? Two of 'em came up behind me. Sons of bitches. I was standing off by the railings. What we're gonna do, you're back on your feet, we drive around the northside, you point out these black bastards. They weren't dinges, Eli. They were the breakers. I mean normal white men! Really? I couldn't believe it. They think you were someone else? Who else would I be? I'm wearing the brown. (Whimpers) Well, there's a puzzlement. You get me.  I can hardly f*cking talk. Well, it ain't like you got anything else you wanna say, is there? What I think, Ray, when things go wrong-- "What did I do? Why do I deserve this?" I don't deserve it. My philosophy-- it goes in here, it comes out somewhere else. God? Fate? I don't know what you call it. "What did I do? What should I make sure I never... ever... do again?" Good time to reflect about it. Butter, salt-- delicious. (Whimpers) Get me the post office over on Illinois. (Coins jingle) Mrs. Schroeder. Father. Is something wrong? My youngest-- Emily, she has polio. I'm sorry. She's frightened, father. It's killing me. God is with her, my child. As he was when he let it happen. There are things I tell children, Mrs. Schroeder, because that's all they can grasp. You're an adult and you came here in your need. I've nowhere else to turn. You confessed something to me not long ago about temptation. Is that still a burden? I'd rather not discuss that. Don't you see the problem? You ask of God, but what do you offer in return? My devotion. Devotion is an act, Mrs. Schroeder. It's something you demonstrate. How? That is for you to decide. (Door opens) Mr. White. Young James. How Nucky shoes be fittin' these days? A little tighter than I expected. Hmph. Need some breakin' in, that all. So what can I do for y'all? This strike... It needs to end. I came here to work something out Oh! Now y'all come. What you think about that, Mr. Purnsley? I think that ball team he sent round swingin' them bats struck out. It wasn't my idea, Chalky. Anthem klan boys shoot up my warehouse? Not my idea either. Jesus, boy, ain't you got any notion at all? Yeah. A plan to make your murder charge go away. (Snorts) How you gonna do that? I'll talk to the governor. What else you got? What else you want? Justice. Meaning what? The families of my men that got killed-- $3,000 a piece. Okay. And them three hooded crackers did the shootin'? I want them delivered to me personally. That's not gonna happen, Chalky. Well, buck, that's the deal. Always be next tourist season, right? I will. I will. Okay, mama. I got a signed baseball. Ty Cobb. Okay, champ,  time to say good night. Good night, mama. We'll see you tomorrow. He is a very famous ballplayer. Good night, darling. Your mom sounded in good spirits, eh? You know, I had a kid sister. Her name was Susan. She was sick too. Consumption. And my mother-- just like your mother with Emily-- she spent every waking moment taking care of her. And my brother and I would get pretty jealous. You did? Sure. Who wouldn't want all that attention? But the thing is, we knew our mother loved us just the same. How about your dad? Sure, of course. He loved us too. (Sighs) Are you in trouble? No. Well, a little. Some people said I did something wrong, but it's not true. That you burned your dad's house down? What? No. What makes you think that? I saw you. No, Teddy. What you saw... That was an accident. Don't worry, dad. I won't tell. Mickey :  Look, I wash my hands of this. Meyer :  And this is just-- it just happened now? Yeah, it just happened today. I don't know where it all came from. This is unbelievable. Don't look at me. I just make it. How'd you do? I didn't sell a drop. The whole city's f*ckin' drenched. Irish whiskey. Better and cheaper than what we're sellin'. It's way cheaper. Well, who's behind it then? Nucky. You know that? In my bones. So much for steppin' down. There's a reason why you cut a snake's head clean off. Who screwed that up, Al? But this whiskey, where's it from? You said you had the coast guard in your pocket. He says a lot of things. Richard : Nucky's man. He's from Ireland. They imported it. So let's pop the f*ckin' mick! That's great for tomorrow. What do we do today? I thought you was runnin' this town. Yeah, that's right. Ye? So you're supposed to be givin' us the answers! Niggers on strike, now this sh1t. They're still out there, you know. More of 'em than ever now. Yeah, I know, Mickey. So this stuff could be sittin' here for months. I said I would take care of it, God damn it! Yeah? You should put that to f*cking music. You know what? f*ck you, Sal. Or Charlie or whatever the f*ck your name is. It's Charlie. Is  that  the issue?! There's a fortune at stake, gentlemen. This alcohol needs to be sold. Yeah, thanks, genius. Where? I propose we split up and sell it in our respective towns. This is my town. What? I said this is my town! Philly then. I wouldn't go there if I was you. On account of Manny Horvitz? All right. You take Philly. I'll head north. Pfft. Look, let's just sell this sh1t. All right? At which point Enoch Thompson left the premises with Mr. White. Randolph :  Albert White, known as "Chalky"? That's correct. Randolph :  Please tell the jury what happened next. Presumably they concluded their deal for the alcohol. Certainly I-- Man :  Objection!  Your presumptions, scintillating though they be, do not help us. You are testifying as to direct knowledge of Thompson's bootlegging. I apologize. Just stick to what you know. Agent Van Alden, what can you tell us about a Hans Schroeder? I beg your pardon? Hans Schroeder. His name is mentioned in your file quite extensively, as is his widow's. Are you baiting me, miss Randolph? I'm sure I don't know what you mean. In your file it says that Nucky Thompson ordered Schroeder murdered. I have no direct proof of that. Well, you certainly spent enough time on it. It was a theory. I was told by my supervisor to focus on alcohol, as you've directed yourself in regard to my testimony. Off the record? Yes? You think he did it. Thompson, ordering Schroeder's murder. I have no doubt whatsoever. Let's break for lunch, shall we? What do you think? Do we have enough? Let's bring him in. (Knocks) (Knocks) (Knocks) Mickey : Munya! Mr. Doyle. Oh. What, are you kiddin'? Better safe than sorry. Sit. Not there. My wife will kill me. (Both chuckle) So... The two of us, eh? The walking wounded, courtesy of Mr. Darmody. I don't follow. My shoulder, your neck. Jimmy ain't had nothing to do with that. You landed at my feet. Your shoulder, I mean. That was Waxey all the way. What have you brought me? Mmm. (Giggles) I'll give you five grand's worth, to settle Jimmy's debt. This is from Darmody? Sure. Like I said. Hmm, and yet he doesn't bring it himself. He's busy, munya. Yes. (Pops) He's a  macher  now... who sends you to do his bidding. Somethin' in my teeth? I took that from the man who tried to kill me. Heilig's chop house. So? (Buckshot chinks) (Groans) Atlantic City-- Mr. Darmody's town. Munya, he-- he tries to kill me and fails. And now he sends $5,000 worth of piss water to get out of it. He's paying his debt is all. "He who dies pays all his debts." Hmm, the Bible, right? Lotta wisdom there. Look, you're still in business, ain't cha? And you don't have to deal with him ever. Just me. Eh... I take the payback. My old pal munya. (Giggles) (Grunts) And you tell me where I find Mr. Darmody for a quiet chat. Manny, we're partners, me and him. I got an investment to protect. (Gagging) What the hell are you doing? Changing your mind. (Whimpering) Sheriff Thompson, good morning. I asked for a lawyer. I am a lawyer, just not yours. Esther Randolph. I'm an assistant U.S. attorney. At my house you come arrest me? Sorry, sheriff, but my professional courtesies don't extend to murder suspects. You're grasping at straws, lady. Actually I think I've got one. Your deputy-- Raymond Halloran? He's got a lot to say about you and a man named Hans Schroeder. And if you've got anything to say-- I'm sure he'll be along any minute. (Door clanks) (Music playing) (Music continues) (Knocks) Sorry to bother you, father. A Mrs. Schroeder to see you? What does she want? She didn't say. Should I ask? Show her in. I'm disturbing you. Not at all, Mrs. Schroeder. Please, sit. They can very easily get out of order, then there's no finding them. How is your little one? The doctor's reluctant to make any predictions. Doesn't wish to give you false hope. Would that be so bad? It would at least be something for now. Wouldn't you rather believe in something real? I want to believe she'll recover. Are you looking for a miracle? Yes. I am. I want my daughter to be made whole. I want her to live and grow. I want her to run on the grass and swim in the sea. And not suffer for the-- for no reason. Do you recall what we discussed earlier? An act of devotion. What is this? For the church-- a donation. I'm not usually handled cash directly, let alone jewels. Then tell me the proper method. Why are you doing this, Mrs. Schroeder? It's a weight on me, father-- on my soul. I want to be free of it, and show that I'm willing. Can we just start there? We can. Shall we pray? (Gulls cawing) What's so fascinating? That fella. Not a care in the world. He certainly doesn't care what he looks like. Jimmy :  He's on the shore. It's summer. If you can't be free here-- put out a blanket and join him. Richard drop you off? Yes. Where's Tommy? At your mother's. I have to leave town for a few days  you're not gonna ask me why? If you want me to know, you'll tell me. I trust you. You don't mean that. Let's not fight. I wasn't trying to. I know you're not happy, Angela. I know there are things that you think about me that you're afraid to say. I'm gonna make it up to you. I'm gonna get everything settled-- once and for all. And you'll see that... I can be the person you want me to be. I heard a joke today. Where? The bakery. You want to hear it? Sure. A man goes into a hotel and he says, "I'd like a room and a bath." And the clerk says "I can give you a room, but you'll have to take the bath yourself." Did I tell it wrong? No. It's funny. You have to take the bath yourself. You sure you have to leave right away? I'm not sure of anything. Unfortunately we didn't get the results we'd hoped for. Spinal polio. The virus invades nerve cells, causing damage to the muscles ithe limbs. If the cells are completely destroyed, as in Emily's case, the paralysis will mostly be permanent. You understand what I'm saying? Margaret? Did your daughter pray? I'm sorry? Last night. You said she prays-- for all the rest of us. I'm sure she did. Yes. Then bless her soul. What do we do now? We measure Emily for braces. You'll take her home. When she's ready, we'll try therapy and hope for the best. I'd say that's good advice. (Crickets chirping) - (Shower running) (Soft creaking) (Muffled scream) No! (Whimpering) (Water shuts off) (Screams) What the f*ck? (Sobbing) Where's Darmody? He isn't here. You are his wife? Yes. Please... I have a child. Please? (Sobbing) Do you want money? He can get it. Lots of it. I can make him. (Sobbing) The most important thing in life, darling? Your health. Your husband did this to you. (Music playing)
