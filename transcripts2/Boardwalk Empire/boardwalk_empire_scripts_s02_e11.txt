 I wanted to serve my country. 
 You know who dies for their country, kid? 
 Rubes, that's who. 
 You know why he enlisted? 
 'Cause he couldn't hack it at Princeton. 
 Jumped through hoops to get him in there. 
 He runs away, joins the army? 
 Accept Jesus as your savior! 
 (Coughs, splashes) 
 Woman : Oh Jesus. 
 It's heroin. You can sniff it or inject it. 
 Get a few samples out to the locals. 
 How about getting this out to the locals? 
 Van Alden : When did this come? 
 Yesterday. 
 I am to receive all correspondence from Mrs. Van Alden immediately. 
 (Abigail cries) 
 Spinal polio. The paralysis will most likely be permanent. 
 What do we do now? 
 Measure Emily for braces  and hope for the best. 
 Are you looking for a miracle? 
 I am. 
 What is this? 
 A donation. I want to be free of it. 
 It's a weight on me, father-- on my soul. 
 Why'd you marry me, Jimmy? 
 Because I love you. 
 But it isn't true. 
 What can you tell us about a Hans Schroeder? 
 In your file it says that Nucky Thompson ordered Schroeder murdered. 
 I have no doubt whatsoever. 
 Let's bring him in. 
 At my house you come arrest me? 
 My professional courtesies don't extend to murder suspects. 
 This alcohol needs to be sold. 
 Where? 
 I propose we split up and sell it in our respective towns. 
 This is my town! 
 Philly then. 
 I wouldn't go there if I was you. On account of Manny Horvitz? 
 Jimmy :  You take Philly. I'll head north. 
 (Muffled scream) 
 Where's Darmody? 
 He isn't here. 
 Your husband did this to you. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Theme music playing) 
 Jimmy. 
 Jimmy? Jimmy, I have to leave. Hmm? I'm sorry. Was I dreaming? We're in Princeton. Don't go. I'm supposed to work breakfast. Let 'em starve. Uhh. I drew you. Is that really what my ear looks like? Woman :  Hello, Calvin. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Woman :  I'm good. Mrs. Krakauer. Oh... My mother's coming in this afternoon. She "needs" to see me. I'll keep out of your hair. No no, you should meet her. You think it's a good idea? Yeah, she'll love you. (Knocks) Jimmy : Cal. You owe me your life. Krakauer was up here snooping. She heard something. I said it was just me reciting Robert service to myself. It makes me sad 'cause you actually do. Next time we go back to using your car. Please? Well, the thing is, that wasn't my car. It's the second door on the left. I hate you. Hey, one more thing. I'll see you tonight? Maybe. Maybe? How come you and not me? Fallon :  As cookies go, this Esther Randolph's strictly vinegar. And the judge? I was giving the signals. He wasn't responding. Signal harder. Any harder he'll nail me for bribery. Then we'll both need new lawyers. Randolph's betting big on the capital case. She wants you in the noose for Hans Schroeder. And the deputy-- Halloran? He'll say you gave the order and they let him walk. What about Eli? Not talking. To the feds? To us. And just so you know, I'm innocent. I wouldn't have taken your case otherwise. What else? They're putting the prohi on the stand. Van Alden? The man's a bigamist. No, he's an adulterer, with a child by your former mistress. Let's not have the jury even start wondering  whose ox is being gored there. But he is a treasury agent. And depending on your leanings-- you need to dust under my eyelids, Harlan? No sir, Mr. Thompson. Then that's all for now. How bad is this? I'm not a naysayer, but a prudent man might want to get his finances in order. Make it a scotch. Was I not clear? Yes sir. Then what? You kept me working these past weeks. With the strike and all-- you don't need to thank me. No sir. But I belong to the Shiloh baptist church-- I appreciate your prayers. Now if you don't mind? Yes sir. What is it you want to say? Well, about a year ago the Deacon held our annual week of miracles-- prayers, baptisms and such for anyone inclined to accept the savior. Your agent Van Alden show up one afternoon  with the other lawman. And? He drowned that fella  in front of us all. Harlan, is it? (Humming) (Stirring) Van Alden :  Good morning. Good morning to you. Breakfast soon. Abigail is asleep? Ja ja.  Babies always are sleeping. Here is the coffee. Thank you. (Speaks Dutch) I don't understand. "How are you? " You are Dutch, no? No. I'm from upstate New York. And your mama and papa? Do you go to them to visit? They don't enjoy my company. How can this be? My parents were followers of reverend Edgartin Sterry, who prophesied the second coming in 1892. I was not yet even born then. Hmm. In anticipation of judgment day, my father gave away our farm. We lived in a tent, penniless, for an entire year  waiting for the lord to return cloaked in fire and glory. This did not happen. My father never got over it. And somehow the mere fact of my ongoing existence is more than he can bear. He will still come. Jesus. Doesn't that worry you? You are a good man, Mr. Van Alden. There's nothing to be frightened of. Well, young lady, would you like to give it a try? Go on, dear. How does it feel? Rubbery. We're going to let go of you. But we're right here. (Gasps) That's a good start. You were standing straight up. Wasn't she, father? Right there with the best of them. Look what I have. What do you say? Thank you. I'm going to talk to your mother for a minute. All right? She'll need to develop strength in her arms and torso, find her balance. Might be a little rough at first. She'll be strongly tempted to go back to crawling. But we're not gonna let her do that, are we? We are not. She's going to do fine. I'll get her signed out. You just have to put your leg through the hole there... You held up Emily. The lord will hold up you. She needs to learn to support herself. A man once was invited to visit both heaven and hell. First he went to hell, where all the tormented souls were sitting at tables laden with food, yet they were starving and howling with hunger. Each soul had a spoon, but the spoons were so long that they couldn't get them into their mouths. Their frustration was their torment. And in heaven? In heaven, to his amazement,  the man found the souls of the blessed sitting at similar tables laden with food,  but they were all fed and contented. Each had a spoon and the spoons were just as long as the spoons in hell,  but they were able to eat all they needed  because they were feeding each other. Your donation was put toward the construction of the new parish hall. I'm glad to hear it. We have enough for the walls and the floor. Now we're praying for a roof. I cado something more. That's not what I was asking for. Emily : Two cups of milk with two spoonfuls of sugar. Man :  Okay, let's go. (Gulls cawing) Okay... And right. Man :  Do you know where your son was last night? He was attending to his business. Which is? Why are you here? It's a double homicide, ma'am. Why are  you  here? I specifically asked for sheriff Thompson. The sheriff's unavailable. Well, you'll need to talk to him, instead of hinting at accusations. I'm just trying to get the facts straight. The facts are these: My son's wife was being intimate with another woman. I highly doubt if it was the first time. An intruder broke in, killed them both. Man :  All right, we got 'em. (Ambulance departs) You're an associate of Mr. Darmody's? Yes. Do you know his whereabouts? He-- he's-- Can't you see this man is a simpleton? He's just someone that my son is charitable to. He doesn't know anything. Do you? Uh... We'll let you know when you can claim the body. Thank you for your sympathy. Were you able to reach him? He wouldn't answer the phone. Well, he needs to come home. People will get the wrong idea. Will you excuse me, please? (Waves crashing) Jimmy :  "My father prov'd himself a gentleman, sold all 's land, and, like a fortunate fellow  died ere the money was spent. You brought me up at--" Padua. "--Padua, where I protest, for want of means-- I have been fain to heel my tutor's stockings,  at least seven years;  conspiring with a beard, made me a graduate..." (Chuckles) "And shall I, having a path so open to my preferment,  still retain your milk in my pale forehead?" To which his mother replies: "O that I had never borne thee." So-- nasty little scene. What's Webster on about here? Mr. Carruthers? The way to graduate from college is to bribe someone, sir. (Laughter) - That may be so in your case. But think more broadly. Mr. Lebarron? It's a corrupt society, so you can't help but be corrupt in it? The jacobeans loved to depict Italy like this. Women are bald-faced whores and men are lustful panderers. All very entertaining,  but what's the scene about? His mother taught him things that aren't of any use. Everybody around him is getting rich. And he can feel it like he's hungry, like he can taste it. Sounds persuasive to me. Good. All right, next week "the revenger's tragedy." Uh, I can't make class next week, Mr. Pearson. S.A.T.C. is out on maneuvers. Taking your soldiering seriously. We're headed for war, aren't we? He just likes the uniform. It's called patriotism! I guess you don't know anything about that. The kaiser never hurt  me. My brother died on the Lusitania. I didn't know that, Tom. Then you might apologize. Sure I do. I-- I'm so sorry. All right, gentlemen, we've averted a duel. "The revenger's tragedy." Read tourneur. Mr. Darmody. Can you stay for a minute? You won't win that way with fellas like that. I know. That was stupid of me. Then why did you say it? Where I come from, people sorta come out swinging. Where is that? Atlantic City. Are you going back there? After you graduate? It's what I'm supposed to do. According to whom? Mr. Thompson. He's my-- guardian. And my mother. Princeton man? Mr. Thompson? No. But he knows people. And he's footing the bill here? As long as I don't screw up. Is that what you think you're doing? I don't know, sir. Am I? Sharpe, Lebarron, they'll do fine  no matter what. It was all set up for them the moment they were born. People like us, we need to be clever. Like us? My father spent 30 years punching tickets on the Northern Pacific. He's proud of me. Doesn't have a damn idea what I do. That's all. Thank you, Mr. Pearson. "What! Because we are poor, shall we be vicious?" "Pray, what means have you to keep me from the galley, or the gallows?" Webster-- terrific stuff, isn't it? I'll see you at the mixer tonight. All right. Thank you, sir. Al :  How's it lookin'? Meyer : We're getting there. Mickey :  Got rid of my whole share in Philly. We didn't even have to go back to New York. Sold the whole lot in Hoboken. What do we do with Jimmy's piece? f*ck Jimmy. It's ours now. He ain't gonna be showing his mug around here again. The quiff was my wife, I woulda done it the same way. If it was your wife, I wouldn't blame her. He's coming back. Seems unlikely. He didn't ice her. Then who did? Manny Horvitz. Little agitation between him and Jimmy. Then it's Jimmy's problem. Sell this sh1t and be done with it. And when he turns up lookin' for his dough? Pay him out of your share. (Luciano chuckles) My share? How you figure that? 'Cause you're a mope, that's how. (Laughs) And what's left over for me? "What's left over for me?" Run these numbers. A.R. holds a half million dollar policy against your life. I don't know nothing about that. I watched you sign it, you f*ckin' snitch. So how about I put a slug in your head and we split the policy with him? My share'll be fine. I thought so. So they couldn't bend their arms? The spoons were too long. Why couldn't they just hold them higher up on the handle? You're missing the point! I'm trying to understand. These-- these parables, they make no sense. You're the man with all the boats and the lifeguard popping up. It's completely different. How? That story is about helping yourself with whatever's at your disposal. Do you not believe in any higher power? The federal government comes to mind. I don't know, okay? But I do know what I don't believe in, and that's divine retribution. What about the evidence? It's not evidence, Margaret. It's coincidence. Emily :  Mommy! Yes dear? I need to go potty. Holler when you're done. Thank you, officer. Well? What do they have? Deputy Halloran's deposition. I'd like you to read it, tell me what you think. He says I murdered Hans Schroeder? Yes. Then I don't need to read it. It's a pile of horshit. Why would he implicate you? Halloran was appointed sheriff--  temporarily-- while I recuperated from a gunshot wound. He wanted it to be permanent. So he fingers you for a murder. Plus this riot sh1t. He takes a shot from some darkie in the line of duty and it's my fault? That was an unfortunate occurrence. I  had nothing to do with it. I'm here to help you, Eli. Then get me bail. You're a flight risk. They won't even-- where am I gonna go? This is my town! Miss Randolph is positing that your brother ordered you to murder Hans Schroeder. I don't take orders from anybody. Eli, if you're willing to cooperate and testify that you committed the murder at Nucky's behest-- well then, Randolph is willing to spare your life. My life? Meaning she won't argue for the electric chair. (Train horn blaring, crossing bell ringing) (Laughing, chattering) Hey! Oh, here he is. Sorry I'm late. So what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I wanted to see you. Can't I do that? You're changing so much. No I'm not. You are. Mrs. Krakauer told me all sorts of shocking things. I stopped by your dormitory. Mrs. Krakauer's just a busybody. Hmm, phone calls from women in the middle of the night. That was you, ma. Kissing underfed waitresses. Her name's Angela. If that's all you're up to with her. She also draws. So does a chimney. How's Mr. Gunderman? Henderson. Arthur Henderson. How is he? He's married, dear. Married and mortgaged in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "Sorry, little squirrel. I thought girls like you could tell." He didn't deserve you, ma. I had my pleasures. That's all that matters. Aren't you gonna open that? (Pours) You can have one too, you know. I'm supposed to write an essay. (Laughs) Where do you want this? In the closet, please. I can't stand the sight of an unpacked suitcase. It makes me think of lonely salesmen and bromo seltzer. You know what I was thinking on the train? I can't ever get too sad, because no matter what, I have you. I love you, ma. Now what are we college kids gonna do for fun? (Phone ringing) How does it happen? She's a widow in a three-room bungalow. He's got the entire eighth floor of the Ritz. Lathrop :  She went after him. Why not? Sets her sight on the big ike, ensnares him with her feminine-- don't say "wiles," Clifford. --Abilities. Your opinion? Beg your pardon? You questioned her. What's your opinion? She left no impression on me one way or the other. Why aren't we bringing her in? Type it up. Randolph :  Yes, I need the federal courthouse on Camden, please. Clerk's office. ♪ three cheers ♪ 
♪ for old Nassau... ♪ Thank you. 
 
 (Chattering) Angela! I thought you weren't coming. I wasn't going to. What changed your mind? My aunt wanted me to clean out the stove with borax and a wire brush. How do I look? Like you're from Bryn Mawr. For you. Did your mother go back? Actually she's-- Gillian :  How could I,  without meeting you first? Ma, this is Angela. Angela this is my mother. We're going to kiss. Of course. Let me drink you in. Simple, restrained. I like it. What you have on is lovely. Oh. I never know what to wear. Corsage, dear. Yes. It's very difficult to raise a gentleman. Yeah, come on, you're gonna love it. Do you know all these people? A few. Over there, they're all upperclassmen. They don't even give you the time of day unless you're  in the yacht club-- I'm attaching myself to both of you. Do you know why? (Laughs) No. Because I'm full of anxiety and socially inept. (Chuckles) Relax. Get yourself a drink, Cal. I've already had one. What's your next piece of advice? You just stay with me, then we'll both have someone to talk to. You're my Roxane. (Gillian laughing) That's from "Cyrano." (Belches) Uh, I worship you. My father owns a tire factory in Dayton. It's unromantic, but extremely profitable. I've had more than one drink. Nobody would notice. Angela :  Jimmy? (Gillian laughing) Jimmy. There's something I need to tell you. What? What? There's something I need to tell you. What is it? I should have said it yesterday. Guess I didn't have the nerve. Anyway I wasn't sure. Sure about what? I'm pregnant. I'm sorry. No. Um... We'll get a place. And, uh. It'll be swell. You'll see. We'll-- we'll be together. Is this a marriage proposal? Well, it will make getting a lease easier. Jimmy, you hardly know me. I know you're a good person. (Crickets chirping) (Music playing) They asleep? Yes. Can I pour you a drink? No thank you. What's wrong? You wanted to talk. I spoke to Fallon. Eli will testify against me to save himself the best he can. What will he say? Enough to put me in jail if miss Randolph does her job. Let's be honest-- maybe enough to put me in the chair. What I have, my money, can be seized. But I can hide it, make sure it's helping the people who matter to me. Why is that important to you? How can I talk to you when you're like this? It's a sincere question. You think I don't care what happens to you? I think you need to believe that something good could come out of all this, that would save you somehow. And I wish it could. What the hell kind of nonsense is Brennan putting in your head? They're not his thoughts. They're mine. There's roughly 160,000 acres,  most of it held in a company that Ed Bader's brother is president of. But all the voting stock-- are you listening? Yes. The voting stock belongs to me. I've instructed bill Fallon to draw up papers transferring it all into your name exclusively. At a future point you can move it to another corporation... (Music playing) ...Which I'll form in another state. We can sell the land at a profit and use that money to... (Distant party noises) You coming back inside? Just getting some air. (Huffs) Ma? I thought we were just flirting. (Sighs) Hold this. What are you doing? Mr. Darmody. What'd you do to my mother? I'm sorry, what? My mother-- what'd you do to her? That was your mother? Did you touch her? Really? I thought she was-- You thought she was what? Let's just say your life is pretty jacobean all by itself. Get up. Don't be an ass. You heard me. Get up, Mr. Pearson. All right. All right. Look. There's no sense in winding yourself up to do something stupid. I will apologize in a convincingly chivalrous fashion-- walk away-- now. I'll pretend this didn't happen. It is happening. (Grunting) (Knocks) (Wings flutter) "Mixelslaw"? Mieczyslaw. Your note was rather cryptic. To keep it on the hush. Sit. No thank you. Please. I don't like the way you loom. What do you have for me, mizzleslav? This particular situation I'm in, I gave it my best. Basically I put the whole operation together and what do I get? A poke up the ass. Painful. I'll say. Now we're gonna sit down-- me, Capone, Luciano and the Jew kid. We're gonna divvy up the money. What about Darmody? Did a bunk. Where? Not my concern. I mean he's lucky I'm a forgiving person, right? Considering. Anyhow... There's gonna be a lotta green on the table. See what I'm saying? You're suggesting that federal agents intervene. I am suggesting that, yes. For what in return? Half back this way. How much are we talking about? Two-- (Soft giggle) Okay, 300 grand. 150 in your pocket. A lot better than the envelope you've been getting, huh? So? I'd prefer not to. Yeah? What? I'd prefer not to. Does that mean no? What does that mean? Don't contact me again under any circumstances. Hey. Hey! You're gonna f*ck me over? (Door slams) (Wings flutter) 'Cause that's not how I think. (Laughs) Oh. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. How much did you drink, ma? What's in that bottle? Mmm. (Laughs) Nothing. Then a lot, I guess. Oh, you have blood on your shirt. Let me rinse it. Come on. Let me-- I got it. (Sighs) How badly did you hurt him? How badly? Enough to get me expelled. No! No. Nucky'll fix it. He can fix it. You'll see. Why did you come here, ma? Oh baby. I'm just the loneliest person on earth. Do you love that skinny girl? I don't know. No. I don't know. Then promise me you won't do anything stupid. Let's get those shoes off and get you into bed. Come on. That's what I would say to you... Come on. ...When you were little. Oh, your shirt. I'll do it later. Whoa-- Jesus! (Giggling) Whoops. (Crossing bell ringing) Arms up. Oh, yes sir. All right. Okay. Oh-- Jesus. Now into bed. I hate for you to see me like this. (Chuckles) Tomorrow you won't remember any of it. I always remember everything, no matter what. You okay? I'm spinning a little. Just try and let yourself breathe, ma. You know how to take care of me. I've been doing it for long enough. When you were little... (Distant train whistle blowing) I used to lie in bed with you, curled up. It would be very quiet. I'd think, "there's no one else in all the world. There's only you and me." (Train whistle blowing) Good night, ma. I love you. There's nothing's wrong, baby. There's nothing wrong with any of it. (Birds chirping) (Distant train whistle blowing) (Car passing by) (Horn blows, car backfires) Left right left! Left! (Bugle playing) Left!  Left right left! Left left, left right left! Left left, left right left! Left left... Man :  Your enlistment is a contract with the United States army. And there are serious consequences if you break it. Is that a commitment you're prepared to make, son? I wouldn't be here otherwise, sir. You haven't listed next of kin. Both mother and father are gone. Is there anyone else you'd like us to contact? Angela Ianotti. She's my fiancee. What's her address? Why are you enlisting, son? Frankly, sir, because I'd like to stick a bayonet straight through the kaiser's guts. What for? I lost a brother on the Lusitania. Sorry. I didn't know you were here. Just peckish is all. It won't disturb me. It's-- it's chafing her here. She can't feel it, of course, so-- may I? A little rough grommet here. Could do with a bit of smoothing out. I'm a dab hand at rigging things, but whatever suits you. Yes. Thank you. (Scraping) Do you think about me? 'Cause I think about you. Then you should stop. And what if I can't? Then I'll pray for you to find the strength to do so. Well, that'd mean you were thinking about me, wouldn't it? (Music playing) Gillian :  James. Are you there, James? James! You have a son and a business waiting for you. Do you understand what I'm saying? I understand. It's been days now. You need to come home and show the world you have nothing to hide. (Snorting) (Sobbing) (Phone ringing) Randolph :  Agent van Alden. This is Mr. Fallon-- Mr. Thompson's new attorney. How are you this fine day, sir? And I believe you may already have met Deacon Lemuel Cuffy. Agent sir. Couple of things to show you. These were your former partner's, I believe. Agent Sebso? Do you recognize these? "It is joy for the just to do judgment." Hands straight in front of you and take a-- - (Shouts) Did something-- No! Randolph :  Clifford! Jesus! (Music playing) Drinking alone? Drinking at all? Let me get a glass and-- I've been subpoenaed. Ignore it. That's all? Fallon can handle it. That's what I'm paying him for. Yesterday you were convinced you were going to jail. Well, today I'm feeling better about things. It turns out agent Van Alden  is not a credible witness. And your brother? Blood is thicker than water. I'll think of something. We began in sin-- I do not want to hear about-- we began in sin. We'll end in it unless we change. The beginning's over. The end hasn't come yet. All I care about is now. Then look what's happening now! What's happening now is you talking rubbish. You're wrong. I have never been so sure of anything in my life. Emily was stricken with a disease-- and I am culpable. How? I've stolen and cheated and deceived. And now I am being punished for those sins, as are the ones I love. Who did you steal from? My family. My employer. You. Who did you deceive? Anyone who thinks I'm good. And who have you cheated on? Well? Say it. I have... I live with the man who had the father of my children murdered. Really? When did I do that? You said-- that he deserved it. And whatever you think I did... You're lying to me and to yourself! Whatever misguided martyrdom you're contemplating... I can't go on pretending... ...While I'm breaking my back providing-- that I'm not being called to account! Are you actually talking about testifying? (Gasps) Have you lost your mind? Let go of me. I will not. You listen. If you want to punish yourself because your daughter got sick, that's your business, but I will not permit you to sacrifice me. "Won't permit"? And if you don't think I'm good as my word, you don't know me at all. Is that understood? Will you strike me now? I have given you everything. (Music playing) Gillian :  We'll have to have a funeral, of course. It's important that everything look right. There won't be many people anyway. She didn't have a very wide circle, did she? The poor girl. The other one-- she wasn't local. They're looking for some family. Not our concern. We'll need to consider Tommy. I told him, "mommy went  away for a few days-- to paint." Well, that buys us a little time. I think-- and she wants her little boy to stay here, where she knows he'll be safe And you know what? A month from now-- (gasps) I'll remember! I'll remember. I'll remember. (Gagging) I'll remember. I'll remember. (Screams) Ha! (Wheezing) (Commodore shouts) Gillian :  No! (Spear clanks) (Sobs) Then finish it, God damn you. Finish it.

I know you couldn't. We don't ever have to mention it again. It's all going to be better now. I hope you're able to see that. One day soon he won't be a little boy anymore. It happens, just like that. I'll put him to bed. And I'll be upstairs. (Music playing) ♪ There are times when you'll feel sad and blue ♪ ♪ when you feel that way, stop and think awhile ♪
