 We have a situation -- 
 Well, I've been tasked with the job of investigating the mole. 
 Narrator: Previously on  Falling Skies... 
 This is what the mole has been after. 
 It will be the decisive factor in ending this conflict. 
 When this war is finished, you, my friend, are gonna be standing behind a counter serving hot dogs to bubble heads in Hawaiian shirts You did something to me. 
 I planted a probe... 
 The mole leaked Colonel Weaver's plans to the enemy. 
 They knew we were coming! 
 We walked right into it! 
 Was being massacred part of the plan?! 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Batteries. 
 Why don't they just come? 
 What are they waiting for? 
 Godot. 
 [ Banging on walkie-talkie ] 
 Okay. Okay. 
 [ Walkie-talkie squelches softly ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 M-a-m-j-j-a-s-o. 
 What letter comes next? 
 Uh, "n." 
 March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, "n" -- November. 
 Who's chasing you, man? 
 Batteries. 
 Oh, right. Here you go. 
 Try this one, Einstein. 
 I'm looking for a word. 
 The first two letters indicate a male, the first three a female, the first four a great man, the whole word a great woman. 
 What's the word? 
 Tricky. 
 Matt? 
 [ Walkie-talkie squelches softly ] 
 If I wanted to go to school, I would've stayed home. 
 Nice talking with you. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Got it -e, her, hero, heroine. 
 Yeah, that's way too easy. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 I thought the bubbleheads put up a safety net around Charleston. 
 That's why God made people like you, Craze -- not to think. 
 What I'm trying to say is, if they did, why is it necessary for Mason to have us practically living out here? 
 She's got a point. 
 What the hell do you think's gonna happen if we get invaded while those bubbleheaded bastards are over there roasting wienies in their compound, huh? 
 We all get scorched. 
 I'm not taking any chances. 
 Maybe the Professor's wrong. 
 Maybe the fishheads aren't coming. 
 Oh, they're coming. 
 You can throw out a mosquito net the size of Texas. 
 What happens, huh? 
 One always gets through. 
 That's why we're here. They are coming. 
 If not today, tomorrow. 
 And if not tomorrow, the day after that. 
 And when they do get here, I am gonna fry me some fishhead ass. 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 Little man, what do you got for me? 
 All the good stuff. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 I got you some cinnamon buns. 
 Cinnamon buns, huh? 
 Coffee. 
 All right. 
 You're gonna make one hell of a thief one day, kid. 
 Thanks. 
 [ Muffled ] 
 Oh, this is great. 
 Where'd you get all this stuff? 
 [ Muffled ] 
 You want more of anything?

 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 He looks like Frankenstein. 
 At least he's walking without crutches. 
 Yeah, I thought he'd be happier about it. 
 I'm happier about it. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 How are you, Maggie? 
 Long day. 
 Looks like my day is just beginning. 
 Hal. 
 What I'm saying is, is outside the military, there's maybe four people that know exactly how this place runs. 
 What are you worried about? 
 What am I worried about? 
 I'm worried about picking somebody strong enough to stand up to them if anything should happen to me. 
 Any of the guys you're considering can do the job, but unless you're planning on being impeached or getting a stroke, I don't think we have to worry about it. 
 In the last two years, I've been kidnapped, tortured, shot, implanted with an eye worm. 
 Last week, I was almost torn apart by a harnessed kid and contaminated by a nuclear reactor. 
 I think we can count on something happening, don't you? 
 Dan. 
 Tom. 
 I thought I was supposed to have Anthony's report on that investigation on my desk yesterday. 
 I talked to him this morning. 
 You'll have it by the end of the day. 
 Thank you. 
 Jeanne? 
 We gonna be ready by tonight? 
 8:00, right? 
 Unless the world falls off its axis. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 We'll be ready. 
 You know, when you first pitched me this idea, I wasn't too sure about it. 
 But now I see what you're going for. 
 The tree of life. 
 The tree of life. 
 The tree of...Liberty. 
 Liberty Tree. 
 Yeah. The Liberty Tree. 
 I like that. 
 This is good. 
 Carry on. 
 I'm gonna have to make a speech. 
 I'm gonna need some kind of speech. 
 Here -t's boilerplate, but it'll give you something to work with. 
 Mmm. Mmm. 
 Mm-ey, where you going? 
 I got to hit the bushes. 
 Craze? 
 Take your snow tires. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 All right. 
 She's old enough to be your grandmother, kid. 
 Craze: I heard that! 
 Pope: I wasn't talking to you. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Ah, give the kid a break, pope. 
 It's probably the most exciting thing he's ever seen. 
 That true? 
 Pretty much. 
 Oh, man. That is sad. 
 [ Both laugh ] 
 [ Gunshot ] 
 [ Gunfire ] 
 You stay down, kid. You hear me? Down. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Craze?! Craze! 
 Craze! 
 Path clear? 
 I'm on it! Go! 
 I got this! 
 Craze? 
 What's going on? 
 [ Gunfire continues ] 
 What's going on is this stupid vest just saved your ass. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Come on, look. We got to move! 
 Pope! Pope! 
 Let's go! 
 I can't see. 
 Don't move, okay? I'll be right back. 
 Aah! No! Don't leave me! 
 Craze, you fell on a piece of rebar. 
 It's sticking into the back of your head. 
 You can't feel that? 
 No. 
 I'm gonna get some -'m gonna get some help, okay? 
 I will be right back. You do not move. 
 Tector! 
 Tector: Go! 
 I need a hacksaw. 
 What's up? 
 We're taking fire on the perimeter, Tom. 
 How bad? Bressler: I'm not sure. 
 Right now, it seems to be confined to the northern sector. 
 The 2nd Mass is out there -en, Matt. 
 Could be an advance. Could be a probe. 
 Or it could be the Espheni offensive the rebel Skitters have been warning us about. 
 I got to get up there. 
 Mr. President, you being out there isn't gonna change a damn thing till we know what we're dealing with. 
 You'll be here, right? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Where else would I be? 
 Then you don't need me. 
 All right. 
 [ Gunfire ] 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 Tom: Hey! 
 You seen your brother? 
 Came by, changed our batteries, and headed out. 
 What do we got? Ghosts. Lots of firepower. 
 Harnessed kids? Don't know. 
 How many? 
 At least six, maybe more. 
 On me, Tom! 
 Dan! 
 Cover me! 
 [ Gunfire continues ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Cover me. 
 [ Gunfire continues ] 
 Dan, please tell me that's not a human being. 
 What the hell? 
 [ Gunfire ] 
 Where's he from? 
 Weaver: I don't know. 
 If he's the real deal, he could be an expeditionary force or he could be some nut job who ransacked an army-surplus store. 
 We should try and talk to them, let them know we're on the same side. 
 He's right. 
 If they were interested in talking, they would've approached us before they attacked us. 
 Listen, we can't afford to be having this fight right now, not with the Espheni invasion hanging over our heads. 
 I don't like the idea. 
 I don't like it, either. 
 Ben! 
 If anybody comes for this guy, we want them alive! 
 Yes, sir! 
 [ Gunfire continues ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Tec? That you? 
 No. It's just the kid, Craze. 
 Come on. Come on down here. I need your help. 
 I need you to hold her head, all right? 
 Very firmly, but very gently, okay? 
 Move her hair back. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Then why did you stop?! 
 Would you shut your cake hole for two seconds and let me do this? 
 [ Groans ] 
 Just pull it out! 
 Stop moving! 
 [ Pants ] 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Don't. 
 [ Alexis whines, stops ] 
 [ Alexis fusses ] 
 [ Slide clinks ] 
 Mommy. 
 [ Breathes heavily ] 
 [ Gasping ] 
 I'm going crazy. 
 [ Alexis fussing, crying ] 
 [ Crying ] 
 Lourdes: Anne? 
 Anne, hey. What happened? 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 I'm okay. I'm fine. 
 Like you were "fine" the other night? Anne... 
 Talk to me. W-what's going on? 
 I want to help. 
 [ Alexis crying ] 
 I was trying to take her blood. 
 And she said, "don't," and pulled her foot away. 
 Then, when I was examining her blood in the microscope, she said, Mommy." 
 And when I turned around, she was standing there in the crib... 
 Looking at me, Lourdes. 
 Just looking at me. 
 W-w-why were you taking her blood? 
 Is something wrong with her? 
 It's not normal, Lourdes. 
 Whatever it is, whatever's going on with her, it is not normal! 
 Okay. Okay. I believe you. 
 I'm just trying to help. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Gunfire ] 
 You seen my son? 
 He's next door with Pope. 
 Matt?! 
 Matt: Dad?! 
 Stay where you are! 
 Pope: I got him, Professor. 
 What do  you  got? 
 Library. Upper right side. 
 You sure? Yeah. 
 I saw the muzzle flash. He's there. 
 That's where I'd be. 
 So, what are we up against, Professor? 
 I'm not sure -uman beings. 
 What the hell they got against us? 
 That's the $64 million question. 
 Medevacs are in. 
 Western sector reports two Humvees moving out across the Cooper River bridge. 
 Okay. 
 If he's in there, he just lost his ride home. 
 You ready? 
 Hey! 
 We're humans over here! 
 Stop shooting! 
 We want to talk! 
 Can you hear me?! 
 So much for talking. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 He... 
 She  is still alive. 
 We can't question her if she's dead. 
 This bitch shot Craze. 
 Killing her won't change that, son. 
 You sure this is gonna work? 
 Just hold her still, okay? 
 Yeah. Don't distract him, kid. 
 He might cut off your fingers. 
 I had this dog when I was a kid. 
 Man, that dog could do tricks. 
 I'd put a treat on her nose, and she'd just sit there for, like, five minutes. 
 She could smile, too. 
 She had the most beautiful smile. 
 What was her name? 
 Annabel. 
 Sounds...regal. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, she was. 
 Till her hind legs went out and she started pissing all over the house. 
 Then, one day... she just won't eat anymore. 
 That's a real uplifting story, Craze. 
 Shut up. I'm trying to make a point here. 
 What's your point? 
 [ Voice breaking ] 
 My point is... 
 Her time had come, you know? 
 Time for what? 
 Pope knows. 
 We're gonna get you out of here. 
 I'm not gonna let you die in this hole, okay? 
 I promise. 
 [ Crying softly ] 
 Keep sawing. 
 Oh, I didn't know you were back. 
 Cancel my afternoon meetings. 
 Tom, can I talk to you? 
 I'm sorry, Lourdes. 
 I don't really have time right now. 
 It's about Anne. 
 Thank you. 
 I found her in the lab with Alexis this morning. 
 She was doing a blood workup on the baby. 
 So, you're worried about Alexis? 
 No. Anne. 
 She's not in good shape, Tom. 
 I think it's possible she's suffering from postpartum depression, maybe even psychosis. 
 She believes the baby is talking to her and standing up and behaving in ways that just aren't possible for a 3-week-old infant. 
 I, uh, appreciate you letting me know. 
 Tom. 
 I did all the routine tests on Alexis when she was born. 
 They were normal. 
 There's nothing wrong with her. 
 Has Anne talked to you about any of this? 
 Um... 
 Where you going? 
 I'm leaving. 
 I don't understand. 
 Maggie... 
 God! 
 What is going on with you?! 
 You know how you accused me of holding something back, keeping secrets from you? 
 I was right, wasn't I? 
 Those dreams I've been having aren't dreams. 
 I've been going to see Karen. 
 She implanted something in me. 
 She controls me... or part of me. 
 All I know for sure is that I've been going to see her. 
 Okay. 
 So...we get it out -he bug. 
 [ Sighs ] It's too late for that, Maggie. 
 No, it's not too late. We'll go to the infirmary. 
 Maggie, would you listen -e'll talk to Anne! just -- just listen to what I have to say! I am the President's son. 
 I have access to information, and Karen wants information. 
 We have a mole. 
 Do you understand what I'm saying? 
 Hal, you're not the mole! 
 And if you think I'm letting you out there where Karen is, you're crazy. 
 I have to go. 
 Fine. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Every relationship I've ever been in has ended just like this. 
 Something happens that I don't like, and my head explodes, and I bail. 
 [ Voice breaking ] 
 But not this time. 
 I'm not giving up on you, Hal Mason. 
 I don't care what that bitch has done to you or what she's made you do. 
 We're gonna undo it, okay? 
 You hear me? 
 I'm not gonna let her win. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What for? 
 For being an ass. 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 This job, it's, like, 25 hours a day, 8 days a week, and I don't think I realized the toll that it was taking on us. 
 With this invasion hanging over our heads, I've been... more than preoccupied. 
 I've been neglectful, and I'm sorry. 
 You knew what you were getting into when you said yes to this job. 
 Lourdes came to see me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Listen, you don't have to go through this alone, whatever it is. 
 We're in it together. 
 I know that I haven't really been doing my part, but that's gonna change. 
 From now on, I'm gonna be there for you. 
 You have no idea what you're talking about, Tom. 
 Okay, you're right. 
 Why don't you tell me what's going on with you? 
 You're not gonna like it. 
 I'll keep an open mind. 
 I don't think she's human. 
 [ Soft music plays ] 
 Lourdes: The rebar runs proximately across the middle cerebral artery. 
 The dark color here is blood because the artery has been ruptured and she's hemorrhaging. 
 Is that why she can't see? 
 No. 
 The occipital lobe here controls sight. 
 And the rebar went through that, ended up over here, missing the temporal lobe, which is in front. 
 That's why she's still able to talk. 
 We're not pulling that thing out, are we? 
 Right now, the rebar is the only thing keeping her alive. 
 It's acting like a cork. 
 So, as soon as we... 
 I got it. 
 The key is the fold. 
 It's all in the fold. 
 
 
 
 [ Alexis cooing ] 
 So, you want to tell me what happened today? 
 Your mom says that you've been talking up a storm and standing around in your crib, staring at her. 
 What's next, the 100-yard dash? 
 You know you're not supposed to be doing any of that, right? 
 See, this is where the wings come into play. 
 You just fold it over like that... and pin. 
 See? 
 It's all in the fold. 
 I'm not crazy. 
 I know. 
 But have you looked at her lately? 
 I don't mean through a microscope. 
 I mean, have you really looked at her? 
 She's beautiful. 
 10 fingers. 10 toes. 
 No claws. No scales. 
 [ Cooing continues ] 
 She's perfect. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 They've taken almost everything from us. 
 Don't let them take her. 
 Don't -- don't do that. 
 I am not crazy, Tom. 
 You're going through something, though. 
 I'm not a doctor. I don't know what it is. 
 Dad, sniper's regained consciousness. 
 Wait for me outside, please. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I love you. 
 And I'm here. 
 I'll see you later. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 She say anything? 
 Uh, name, rank, serial number, and a few choice words for my spikes. 
 Why were you firing on my soldiers? 
 What are you doing here? What are you looking for? 
 Katherine Fisher. First Lieutenant. 
 Serial number 02-- 022487. 
 Yeah, I heard you the first time. 
 Unless you want to get out the water board, I don't see her telling us much. 
 Well, I hope it doesn't come to that, Colonel. 
 Figure of speech, sir. Figure of speech. 
 You hungry? 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 Did you offer her any water? 
 She hasn't asked for any. 
 Tom: Ben. 
 Ben: Yep. 
 Tell you what. 
 Since you don't feel like talking, how about I guess what I think happened, and if I'm wrong, you can feel free to disagree? 
 You're wasting your time. 
 Maybe, but I got five minutes. 
 I think you've been out there checking us out. 
 Maybe for a day, two. 
 Maybe more. 
 I think you saw us working with Skitters, spiked kids. 
 I think you saw aliens you hadn't seen before. 
 And you probably thought that you'd stumbled into an alien compound filled with human collaborators. 
 Am I right? 
 The world has changed, Lieutenant. 
 We are no longer fighting the Espheni by ourselves. 
 The Skitters that you saw are rebels fighting with us. 
 And the aliens you saw are a race called the Volm, also our allies. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You really want to know what I think? 
 Yes. 
 I think the only good alien's a dead alien. 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 Colonel, who the hell is this bozo? 
 You best not let your mouth overload your tail there, soldier, or this could go south real quick. 
 That man is the President of the new United States, and you'd do well to show some respect. 
 You think something's funny about that? 
 [ Chuckles lightly ] 
 I work for the President, sir -he real President, Benjamin Hathaway. 
 Who do you think sent me here? 
 If it is the case, I guarantee you her squad is, hightailing it back to whatever hole the President is hiding in. 
 They're gonna tell him we're collaborating with the enemy, and he's not gonna look kindly upon us. 
 Unless she's making it all up. 
 She could be spinning a fairy tale about President Hathaway. 
 Well, if she isn't, they'll be back in force. 
 If she is, then we need to get to the President, tell him what the hell we're doing here. 
 Bressler: Professor, we're on high alert, anticipating an Espheni strike any day. 
 Every man, woman, and child who can fire a weapon or fill a sandbag is spoken for. 
 We can't afford to be sending anybody out on a wild goose chase right now. 
 We can't afford not to, General. 
 You really want to be fighting this war on two fronts -gainst the Espheni 
 and  ourselves? 
 If Benjamin Hathaway is alive, we don't know where he is. 
 Unless we take the gloves off, that sniper's not gonna tell us. 
 [ Fussing ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I thought you might be hungry. 
 And thirsty. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 That must've set you back. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I'm sorry about this morning. 
 I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 How you feeling? 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm not fine. I don't know. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I mean, looking at her now, she's everything I could've wanted Tom's and my child to be. 
 But? 
 But I stopped believing in Santa Claus two years ago. 
 You want to know what I think? 
 Thank you. 
 I think for two years, all we did was run. 
 We survived by doing things we never thought we'd be capable of. 
 And now that we're settled down in Charleston, it's catching up to us. 
 We're all suffering on some level. 
 [ Voice breaking ] 
 I just... 
 I can't afford to fall apart right now. 
 [ Crying ] You know? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
 I don't have to be back at work until tomorrow. 
 I can stay here all night if you need me to. 
 Thank you. 
 Wait. 
 Did Tom send you here? 
 He doesn't even trust me with my own baby. 
 [ Crying ] 
 He trusts you, Anne. 
 Just leave. 
 Leave, Lourdes! Now! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 Tom asked me to stay until he got home. 
 [ Sparks crackling ] 
 How you doing, Bear? 
 Hi, Dad. 
 I brought you some hot chocolate. 
 Mm. 
 Mmm, hot. Thank you. 
 I like this. 
 This is... this is good. 
 I-I think people are gonna like it, yeah. 
 If anyone lives to see it. 
 The Espheni are coming, Dad. 
 We all know it. 
 That makes what you're doing here unimportant, a waste of time? 
 No, sweetheart. 
 This is... 
 We're all gonna die. 
 Yes. Someday. 
 Someday, I surely plan to. 
 I mean at their hands. 
 Maybe. 
 But as long as we're here, we can't stop doing what we do, being who we are. 
 Otherwise, we're just already dead -ead on our feet, and what good is that? 
 [ Chuckles lightly ] 
 How do you stay so optimistic? 
 If I'm optimistic, it's because I got something worth dying for. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I heard about what you did out there. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Sometimes the best thing that we can do for people is just to be there for them as a witness... when they leave. 
 You could be a real pain in the ass, you know that? 
 But you could fight like a banshee. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Nice words, Professor, but as usual, too little too late. 
 Pope. 
 That's all right, Dan. Let him speak his mind. 
 She never should have been out there. 
 Hell, she was dead on her feet long before that shot rang out. 
 Man, you got half my Berserkers working on your top-secret bubblehead project, and the other half are on the frontlines just in case the fishheads get hungry. 
 There's no rest. 
 There's no explanations. 
 We don't even know what the hell it is we're helping them build. 
 Do you? 
 You don't -ou don't care. 
 Not really. 
 Lee's lying in there with a hole in her head not because of them -ecause of you. 
 Mr. President. 
 You. 
 You're right. 
 Pope, is that you? 
 It's me. Mm. 
 I'm right here. 
 Where's the kid? 
 Where's Matt? 
 He took a break. 
 He's coming. He's coming back. 
 You know his name, huh? 
 Pope? 
 Yeah, sweetheart? 
 When we get out of here, take me someplace, okay? 
 Sure. 
 Where you want to go? 
 Disneyland. 
 Disneyland? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we could steal a car. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 No, not just any car... 
 A nice car. 
 Just me, you, and the kid. 
 I can't go to Disneyland, Craze. 
 They won't let me in. 
 Why not? 
 I got into a fistfight with Goofy last time I was there. 
 I'm banned for life. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 Just my luck, huh? 
 Pope? 
 [ Crying softly ] 
 Maggie: Hal, listen to me. 
 People died because of the information the mole gave Karen. 
 The Vice President was murdered. 
 Do you remember killing him? 
 Do you remember telling Karen anything that would've gotten people killed? 
 Does it matter? 
 Yeah, it matters, because she made you do those things. 
 Whatever it is you did, if anything, you're not responsible for. 
 Tell that to the people who died. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Listen to me. 
 This is treason we're talking about, all right? 
 Murder. 
 Do you have any idea what's gonna happen to you if you turn yourself in? 
 You have any idea how amped up people are about this? 
 They'll hang everything on you whether you did it or not. 
 Not even your father's gonna be able to save you. 
 You better be sure about this, Hal, before you say anything to anybody. 
 I'm sure. 
 I pushed the meeting with Adam Nye to tomorrow. 
 Water and Power and the Housing Authority can wait till the end of the week. 
 And I've set the follow-ups with the V.P. candidates for first thing in the morning. 
 No need. I've already made my decision. 
 Who? You. 
 Me? 
 Wh-- I-I don't know if I can -ut it's not -'m not -- 
 You'll be fine. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 [ Feedback ] 
 President Clinton once said that there would always be a place in our collective memory for those who've willingly given their lives so that we could live ours. 
 Two years ago on this day, our lives changed forever. 
 Many of us lost our families, our friends, our neighbors, but as I look... 
 The truth is as I look around here this evening, nothing much has really changed. 
 We're still fighting, still losing loved ones, still living under fear, still searching for...hope. 
 In fact, as I look around here this evening, it's really hard to look at what we've built and not compare it to what we've lost. 
 I lost a friend today. 
 And her sacrifice is an all-too-familiar reminder that every single day matters. 
 Every single one of us matters. 
 Every single one. 
 Tonight, we will inscribe on the leaves of this tree the names of your loved ones who have fought and fallen, those who have died and deserve our remembrance. 
 And so, like my friend, they'll live here, on the Liberty Tree, forever. 
 And though the branches will undoubtedly grow, because the cost of freedom is high, this memorial means that no matter how much time goes by, no matter how hard living gets, we will remember. 
 We will remember that it's not about how long we live but how we live and what we leave behind. 
 And we will remember my friend, Lee Tedeschi, and all the others and why they fought... 
 ...and why we do.
