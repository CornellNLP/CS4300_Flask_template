 Previously on Falling Skies... 
 Skitters hit us, and they hit us hard. 
 They're coming this way next. 
 So you're supposed to send anyone under 20 ahead with me. 
 I don't think anybody's gonna go for this. 
 101, 102. 
 You just did 102 push-ups! 
 He's like a different kid. If ours patrols tell us an attack is imminent I've decided to send Matt and Ben along with Lieutenant Clayton. Our kids are our future and their safety has got to come first. I can take you to your family, Eli. And you'll bring more in two days? That's the deal. I knew it was a good idea to keep you alive, Pope. [ Panting ] [ Indistinct shouting and light applause ] Oh, sorry! [ Cheering ] Yeah, I'll get it back out to you. Young man: Take it, Jimmy. Take it! Take it! Take it! Jimmy, I'm open! Over here! Jimmy, I'm open! I'm open! Come on! Over here! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Shouting ] Ah. Lourdes. Oh, come on, guys. We can take them. We can take them. Boy: You weren't even trying! I  wasn't trying? You just showed up! Yeah, what were  you  doing over there? Tessa: Just leaving me all by myself. Hal: Come on, guys! Keep your heads up! We can take them! Let's do this! Sanctuary 8, 2nd Mass. Zero? I don't think so. [ Chuckling ] Oh. Well, you may have us on age and height, and there's something you need to know about the 2nd Mass., Tessa. We don't give up. [ Chuckles ] I'll walk it out. Didn't you see me there? I was right there. Yeah, yeah. I saw you. Just stay away from me, okay? Hey, they're going back. Yeah, Clayton's walking our fighter escorts to the main road. If the skitter attack's as bad as they say it's gonna be, they'll be happy to have them back. When's dad gonna catch up? Soon as the 3rd Mass. makes the rendezvous... Couple days Max. Hey. I miss him, too. All right, guys. [ Indistinct shouting ] Tessa! Hal: Take it, Jimmy! Take it! Take it! You're not gonna let them score even once? You know  me. Yeah. That's right. I do. You like  that  one, don't you? Dad. You know why they're here. Just... Don't like him too much. Keep that ammo out back with the .50 Cal. 3rd Mass. comes in hot, skitters and mechs can't be far behind. We're gonna have to be able to move fast. Yeah, that's gonna be easier for some than others. Sarah, right? Did Dr. Glass give you any kind of E.T.A.? Yeah. Two days ago. He's stubborn. So it's a boy. Don't know. Just didn't like calling him an "it." All right. Well, let's hope that you can hang on till after we move. Excuse me. Captain, do you have any children? Two daughters. You better get in line before the pot runs dry, mama. If this attack happens, she's gonna have to keep up. Don't worry about her. We'll do what we have to do. "We"? What are you, her keeper? No. I'm just pragmatic. Get in the chow line with the pregnant lady, nobody even minds if you ask for seconds. Used to  hate  eating my vegetables. You won't hate these. They're from our garden. And the zucchini is amazing. Better than anything you had at Central Square. Welcome back. Any problems? No. Your friends are on their way. And I didn't see any sign of skitters, so I made a detour. Apples. Clayton: Fresh and ripe as can be. You go ahead, help yourself. Pretty nice setup you got here, Terry. You're settling in. You think we're getting complacent? I've just gotten used to packing light. Yeah, well, we're pretty secluded up here. Like I said, the skitters have already swept the area, so... And if we did have to jump, we could still hit the ground running. Hey, dad, try some? Mm-hmm. [ Slurps, exhales sharply ] How does she do that? How do you do that? [ Chuckles ] It's great, hon. Thanks. Terry, you needed a hand with that generator? You got it. This goes in here? Yeah, that's good. Thanks. [ Door opens ] I smell asparagus, which means you're boiling it, which means you're ruining it. We'll pass that on to the chef. Kudos, once again, for the information. 2nd Mass. was  exactly  where you said it was gonna be. It wasn't exactly voluntary. And like I said, this doesn't have to be this way. Mm. So, what is this, my last chance to convert? Maybe. You must have done one hell of a Tony Robbins on those people to get them to hand over their kids. I  served   with those people. Weaver's always been by the book, so new orders from Colonel Porter were enough for him, and, uh, his second-in-command, um... Mason. It's pretty clear he'd do anything to protect his boys. You really think you can deal with those lizards? It's not about winning or losing anymore, Pope. It's about surviving. Yeah, where does that leave you and me? Right where we were after you broke into our supply shed. Well, to be fair, it was unlocked. Yeah, because you stabbed his brother, who was supposed to be guarding it. You're making a big mistake, Clayton! I really am one hell of a cook! Oh, I don't doubt that! Bye, Pope! [ Door closes ] Pretty handy with a mop, too. This place could use one. It's covered in broken glass. [ Spits ] Looks like these two won't make it back to the 2nd Mass. anytime soon. [ Flies buzzing ] Civilization... You got to love it. Captain. The conditions of these bikes is a disgrace. Is that right? I'll have to look into that. Which ones of these are gassed up? [ Sighs ] Those two are good to go. I don't remember you being assigned to patrol. That's right. You're assigning me now. We have fighters for that. We have Dai... Dai can come with me. It's been 48 hours. There's been no sign of the skitters, no sign of the 3rd. At the very least, the escorts should be back by now. So they were delayed. It happens in war. That's not good enough. Clayton said he's taking the kids to Westminster. It's a half a day's walk. We can do that in a couple of hours. We'll go. We'll check it out. If it's all fine, we'll come back. What happens if the skitters attack while you're gone? What if they come after  you? You're not just another civvy, you know. I could order you to say! [ Engine turns over ] You could. [ Engine revs ] Tom! Whatever happens, I want you and Dai back. Understood? [ Engines rev ] 2 miles. No sign of Pope. Think he's gonna try anything? No. Pope could have killed you. And coming after us buys him nothing. How long are we gonna keep this up? Look, it's a lot easier on everybody if they want to be here. Next exchange is tomorrow. We'll see after that. Hal: Eating vegetables like a champion. Thought I heard some commotion out there. One of the sentries thought he saw a coyote. Mike: You definitely have a different scale of problems out here. [ Chuckles ] You get used to it after a while. What's the matter, Rick, not hungry? Tell you what [Clears throat] When your old man and I were posted together, he could not stop talking about you. Don't worry. Mostly good stuff. And what good stuff could that be? How I was sick all the time? How I could barely catch my breath? [ Utensils slam ] How can you eat their food? Excuse me? We are  guests  here, Rick. I raised you better than that. Excuse my son's manners. You get a pass on chores tonight... Since you're new here. [ Scoffs lightly ] You don't have to do that. [ Mockingly ] "Since you're new here." [ Insects chirping ] [ Owl hoots ] What do you see out there? I don't know. Stars. And captain kick-ass up there. [ Both chuckle ] I mean, I know you guys think you're off the skitter radar and everything, but shouldn't there at least be patrols or... Aren't  you  the soldier? [ Chuckles ] Chip off the old block. Then your father, he's still... Alive. Yes. Yes. Um... I was just thinking about how this is the first time we've been apart since the attack. But you like it here, don't you? Yeah. Lourdes: Hal. I mean, it's nice. [ Door closes ] I'm sorry. I'll catch up with you later. I knew I'd seen it. Eli Russell was wearing it when his father robbed the clinic. I was there when Clayton let the Russells run. Maybe the kid dropped it. [ Sighs ] What? Okay, it's probably nothing, but they've got sentries posted on the house, and the barn's locked up tight. So? Nobody's watching the sky or the road. I mean, it actually feels like they're more interested in watching us. Or maybe not. Look, I've known Terry Clayton since a week after the attack. It's gonna take more than a backpack and looks to convince me this is anything except what he says. Round up the others. Get them to bed. I guarantee this will look better by morning. Yeah. [ Sighs ] [ Breathing shakily ] [ Gun cocks ] I always liked you, Mike. That's why I'm gonna talk and you're gonna listen. [ Gun uncocks ] Eli Russell. Short answer? He was here. What's the long answer? I can't even begin to tell you what it was like when the 7th went down. Skitters came after us like locusts. They tore us to pieces. We're the only ones who survived the raid, and the skitters were still hot on us. I mean, we'd retreat, defend, retreat, defend, and they still kept coming. We had a little young girl with us... Megan. She fell behind. Didn't realize it until it was too late. Skitters got her. And we just kept retreating to save the group. And then they stopped. They stayed away for a week. It's almost like they were saying, "Okay, thanks." Thanks for  what? For not attacking when they had Megan, for letting them keep her. That's what they figured. So Megan found us here a while later. She'd been harnessed, but she also had a message from the skitter who was in charge of her group. All they wanted were the kids. A skitter told you this? Through Megan. Yeah. Mike, they didn't want to die any more than we do, but they have their missions, too. It sounds crazy, but it's like every group has to hit their numbers. Once we understood that, once we knew what they wanted and what they didn't want, the arrangement... Just evolved. You've been trading kids to the skitters? In return for immunity for my men and their families. That's why I went after the 2nd Mass. So the 3rd Mass., on the run, Porter's orders... It was all a lie. Yeah. I need to know what you're thinking, Mike. What  should  i be thinking? That this is a messed-up world and this is all we have. And I know that you understand that, and that's why I asked you to come along. And if I say no? This is not just about your survival anymore. You got to think about Rick. Mike... Okay, everyone, I'll let you know when to break out the cigars. And I know you got better things to do. Let's go. No, Margaret, please, stay. All right. As long as I don't have to say "push, push." Oh, my God. Is it supposed to feel like this? It's okay. It's just a contraction. [ Moaning ] There you go. And breathe. You got a name picked out? If it's a boy, I was thinking "David." Is that the baby's father? No, that would be sperm donor. Yeah, dad's not in the picture. I was a work-at-home interior designer. Figured I could be a work-at-home single mom, too. My timing always sucked. What do you mean? I had it all planned out. I was gonna do meetings on Skype. I'd already joined a play group with other working moms. Then, six weeks after I got pregnant, aliens invaded the planet. All right, let's take a look. Here you go. Bring your knees up. [ Gasping ] All right. All right. All right. We're just gonna take a look. That's good. I wish you'd known him before. Sick as he was, I never heard him complain. Not once. [ Chuckling ] And, Lord, he could make me laugh. I hated it when he was taken. But I hate what they did to him even more. Mike, what's going on? Hal? Grab your weapon. Gather the others. We're leaving this place now. Clayton's made a deal with the skitters. Hey, Rick, come on! We got to get up, buddye got to go. We need to get out of here. Get up. Hal? What are you doing? Clayton made a deal with the skitters. Tell me you don't know about this. I-I was gonna talk to them about you, fix it so that you could stay. Go. Go. They're never gonna let you leave! Go, go, go! Dad! Dad!! No... no time! Got to go! Dad, wake up! They're leaving! Get up, dad! They're leaving! The kids are getting away! Go, go, go, go. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go! They're going around this way! Clayton: Move, move, move! All right, we need the little ones alive! Go, go, go, go, go, go! [ Gunshots ] Back here. Stay down. Down! Come on. Go. Go. I swear to God, I'll kill the next man I see! [ Machine-gun fire ] Mike, come on! [ Panting ] I got this. You two keep going. You can't out-shoot all those guys. I can try for a while. [ Machine-gun fire continues ] You just got to promise me you take care of Rick. Keep him busy. [ Machine-gun fire continues ] Okay. Listen, Ricky, no matter what happens, I love you, always. You hear me? But you got to go. You got to run. You stay with Hal. I'll see you soon. Go. Go! Line in the sand, is that it?! Or maybe you think you're just somehow better than us! They harnessed my son! I know what they're doing to these children! Maybe I can't stop it, but I sure as hell won't be a part of it! [ Gun cocks ] The world's coming apart, Mike. [ All panting ] [ Gunshot ] Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. [ Engine shuts off ] Man: All right, I'll let him know. [ Dog barking ] [ Indistinct talking ] 
 
 About time. What'd you find? Nothing. This map is wrong. What are you talking about? Oh, it's rural, all right, but we didn't see anything even close to Clayton's sanctuary. Still no sign of the 3rd? No. Escorts aren't back yet? No, still not back. Damn it. Clayton had no reason to lie to us. Then why is not one thing he told us is holding up? We need to organize search teams. Kids on foot couldn't have gone that far. No way. Our orders are clear. We're to hold this position. Orders relayed to us by a guy that we barely know! In a dicey situation where we don't have clue one about what might have really happened! You know something's not right! All I know is what I've been  told. We wait! You  wait. I'm going back out. It'll be daylight soon. [ Birds chirping ] Hal: I haven't heard anything in a while. Maybe we lost them. Lourdes: It's still a long way back to the school. What do you think? They're about to fall over. Better it happens inside than out. Let's go this way. How's Mike gonna find us? He told us to keep moving. He's gonna try to catch up, all right? [ Sighs ] Okay. All right, everybody. We're gonna hole up here for a couple of hours. Then we're gonna move out. The rest of the kids are up in the bedrooms, and they're already asleep. You play? It's been a while. This was always one of my favorites. [ "Once in Royal David's City" plays ] [ Music continues ] [ Music continues ] Think they'll find us? They'll try. You should get some sleep. I'm not tired. I should go ahead, try and get help. No. No. We're staying together. We get a couple hours' sleep, and then we're gonna head out. They're exhausted. You're exhausted. I can move faster on my own. Let me do this. Are you sure that's a good idea? Why wouldn't it be? What if you get lost... Or you just keep going? Keep going where? Someplace safer. The only place he's going... Is the school. And he's right. We need the help. [ Sighs ] You go to that highway, and you follow it. You stay off road as much as you can. If you see or hear anybody, you run. You run all the way back to the school. Okay. All right. Hal... I, um... I never said thanks for... For getting me from the skitters. You're welcome. You math geek. [ Chuckles ] Dumb jock. [ Sighs ] [ Indistinct talking in distance ] Greene: They must have got on the road here. Clayton: All right, they can't be traveling too fast with the little ones tagging along. So let's keep our eyes open! Man: I'll try. It's been hours. Why isn't the baby moving? [ Moans ] I was afraid of this. Your baby is breech. "Breech" meaning... Well, his head is way up here instead of facing down. Baby can't move into the birth canal. Is he okay? Well, we need to get him turned around. And if you can't, what, you'll do a C-section, right? I'm not an OB/GYN, and I'm not a surgeon. You de-harnessed those kids. Yeah, with a blowtorch. Dr. Glass. Is she gonna be able to move if we have to? I don't know. Her baby's breech, and I would hate to try a C-section here. Breech? Hello. My first daughter was a breech baby. You're going to help? When my daughter was born, I helped the doula turn the baby from the outside. You assisted in an external cephalic version? I never knew what they called it, but my wife and I did a home birth. You know, people think that soldiers are brave, but, uh, I'll take combat over childbirth any day. You ready to try this? Yeah. Right. Doctor, shall we? Anne: Let's get to work. [ Groans softly ] [ Engines revving ] [ Engines shut off ] How far out are we? Far. If this war is coming, it's taking its sweet time. That looks like Ben. Ben! Ben: Dad! Where's Hal and Matt?! They're with the others, but they don't know Clayton's coming! They're not at the sanctuary. No, no, no. Mike said it wasn't safe, so we left. They started shooting at us! Who was shooting at you... Clayton? Dad... I think Mike's dead. Is anybody else hurt? I-I don't know. Okay. You're okay. Dai's gonna take you back, but first I need you to tell me everything. G-4. Ah. Psych. Not even close. Hey. What are you looking at? I'm waiting. You're worried about Ben. I'm worried about all of them. This must be what my dad goes through, except for he's a lot better at dealing with it than I am. No way! You sunk my battleship. Guys! Hey, pack that up, all right? We got to hit the road here soon. Kind of like the old days, you know. Eating in the dining room... Board games. Yeah. Never had the patience for them. Lacrosse, football... that was my thing. Ever think we'll have this again? Someday. You really think we can beat them? Think we're gonna kick their alien ass. Clayton: Good morning! They found us. Quiet. Quiet. Come on out! We're taking you home! Stay down. You know, I actually thought of  buying  in this neighborhood once upon a time. Don't make me come in there for you, Hal! Nobody wants to see anybody else get hurt! We know about your deal! You need us alive! Yeah, well, there's a term in war... "Acceptable losses." If one of your friends gets hurt or killed, I can live with that. Can you?! Go to hell! Down! Get by the tree! Kid's armed, Clayton. Not good. What are we gonna do now? I'm gonna try to hold them off. You take them out the back. Take out the shooter, and the rest will walk out. Man: All right. Got a line on him? Take your shot. [ Gunshot ] Man #2: Behind you! Get your damn head down, kid! Get around! Hey, Clayton! How's that skitter deal working now, huh?! Watch the house. Nail that son of a bitch! [ Gunfire ] Aah! Give it up, Pope! [ Gunfire ] Aah. Pull up a chair, Professor. Put it down, Pope. No, I'm just getting started. Trying to give your kids a fighting chance. That doesn't explain why you're here. It's complicated. I got  no  tolerance for anybody who gets into bed with the skitters. How many are down there? Got six or seven. Your whole tribe's down there. Your oldest has a gun. They'll kill him if it gets them the rest. That's too many of them. If we open up, we might get lucky and get one or two. I'll take those odds. I won't. We get into a firefight, we're not the only ones at risk. So what are you gonna do? Stop it. Hold your fire! Pope's dead! Clayton, it's Tom Mason! I'm coming out! It's dad! Hey! Mason... how'd he find us? We're not taking any prisoners today, Mason! You might want to think about that. Yeah? Everything you told us is a lie. I know you haven't talked to Porter, 'cause I have, and he's on his way. And you're gonna what? You're gonna offer yourself up as a hostage. Is that it? Why? I don't want them to get hurt. Grab his weapon. What makes you think he's telling the truth? 'Cause Tom's smart enough to understand that if I even suspect he's lying, I'm gonna take it out on his boys. All right, Tom, you call them out! Hal, Matt, come on out! It's all over! Everybody, come on out! [ Exhales sharply ] Matt: Dad! Dad, what'd you do? You would have kept fighting, and they would have killed you, and I'm not gonna let that happen. Going back's just as bad. First rule of combat is survive. Greene: Okay, let's go. Some night. Took a big hit for this one. Yeah, it was worth it. What's gonna happen to dad? I don't know. All right! Let's get all the kids in the stable! Now! Hey. Hey. I got him. I got him. Man: Stay with them. No! I'm not going! Dad! [ Gunshot ] Drop 'em! Okay, who's next?! Who's next?! What about me, Dan? You gonna shoot me, too? Only if I have to. Tom... So what's the next step in this plan of yours? 'Cause I was thinking maybe... [ Grunts ] You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Did you know they were waiting for us? I hoped. Wasn't sure you were gonna show up. I almost didn't. Dad! Told you to  send  the cavalry, not come with them. What do you want to do about  them? We'll take their weapons, but I don't see bringing these people back to the 2nd Mass. You people... You can go or you can stay... I don't really give a damn. But if I find that you've been dealing with the skitters again, I'll kill every last one of you. Thanks for coming back for us. You did really good. [ Baby crying ] Charlotte, how can you be hungry again? Why is it I always get the seat next to the crying baby? Show's over, creep. That wasn't for you. [ Chuckles ] Congratulations on a successful delivery. Weaver did most of the work. After that, it was just your average childbirth in a high-school chem lab. Sarah was great. Baby Charlotte is beautiful. 10 fingers, 10 toes. [ Chuckles ] I always loved that sound. Yeah, I'm  fine,  by the way. He'll limp, but he'll live. You could have kept running. Probably  should  have. Probably still will, given half the chance. Well, until you do, the kitchen's short-handed. I guess I'm back where I started. Consider yourself lucky. [ Birds chirping ] Mike was a good man, good father. I could tell from being around him how much he loved Rick. Like all of us here today, he was faced with a decision. He could have run and saved himself. But instead... He stood his ground and fought for us. I'm gonna miss him. We're gonna miss him. Captain. You go ahead. Tom: If this was a proper military funeral, we'd have somebody playing "Taps." It's a bugler's song from the Civil War used to signify the end of a day's work. And in a way, it's a lullaby, to tell soldiers that... All was well and that it was safe to rest. So rest easy, Mike. We'll take it from here. ♪ And our eyes at last shall see him ♪ ♪ through his own... ♪ Clayton told his skitter friends that he'd secured our kids. That ought to buy us a couple of days. Should never have let them go. It was the best option, given what we knew. Next time, I'll trust my instincts. ♪ ...Our Lord, in heaven above ♪ I don't understand... How people could kill each other. Sorry about your dad. Why? Killing's in their nature. Their  nature? Humans. We  would never kill one of our own. You should understand that.
