 Narrator: Previously on 
 Falling Skies... 
 We have to beat them. 
 We will. 
 We'll see each other again. I promise. 
 We can ally with the rebel Skitters and hit the Overlords with everything we got. 
 I will  not jeopardize this city -- 
 I was told to find you -hat you were the only one who would understand. 
 Who sent you? 
 The one with the red eye - the leader of the rebellion. 
 Some of them must have known that Tom would try to reach out to his rebel Skitters. 
 So you're locking us up? 
 Tector: Drop your weapons and step back! 
 Bressler: The civilian government's been suspended. 
 Charleston is now under martial law. 
 Your damned alliance is gonna kill us all. 
 You wanna make that rendezvous with your rebel Skitters, I suggest you suck it up -nd fast. 
 Nice work, boys. 
 Looks like you dropped us in the middle of a good, old-fashioned coup. 
 Shut up, Pope. 
 Why now, General? 
 What were you waiting for? 
 The perfect scapegoat? The 2nd Mass? 
 I've been waiting for Dr. Manchester to come to his senses. 
 And patiently, I might add. 
 And I was acting in the best interest of our citizens. 
 The people voted for civil rule, not for a military junta. 
 Don't be so naive, Arthur. 
 Eventually, the aliens will find us. 
 We have no choice  but  to go on the offensive -- now. 
 You with us...or not? 
 Not this way. 
 I'm sorry, General, but my vision of the new United States doesn't begin with a military coup. 
 I'll agree that Arthur may have lost sight of some of the original goals, I would have assumed, given its reputation, the 2nd Mass would be chomping at the bit for the chance to take it to the enemy. 
 I guess I assumed wrong. 
 Lock them up! Get them inside! 
 Appreciate the solidarity, Tom. 
 This has nothing to do with you, Arthur. Believe me. 
 [ Alarm blaring ] 
 That's an outer security perimeter breach! 
 Let's move! Let's move! 
 [ People screaming ] 
 Move! Move! 
 Prepare to fire! 
 Stand by! 
 General, wait! Those are the rebels. 
 How can you be sure? 
 The one with the red eye - know him. 
 I said, "prepare to fire"! 
 Stop! 
 We're not here to hurt anyone. 
 Ben. 
 Are you all right? 
 Ben! 
 General, tell your men to lower their weapons. 
 [ Skitter growls ] 
 [ Blaring continues ] 
 [ Blaring continues ] 
 [ Skitter growls ] 
 Sir? 
 [ Skitter growls ] 
 Hold your fire. 
 Stand down!

A More Perfect Union 
Original Air Date on August 19, 2012 
 [ Skitter clicks ] 
 We'll begin, if that's okay. 
 [ Warbling ] 
 It is good to see you again, Professor. 
 I'm sorry that our last meeting had to end so badly. 
 No one is to blame, except perhaps our mutual enemy. 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 The Skitter talks through a human. Don't ask me how. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 What, uh... What brings you here? 
 Captain Weaver, I'm not sure you realize the prize you had when you captured the Overlord last week. 
 We didn't want any prize. We were just trying to survive. 
 Understandable. 
 That particular Overlord, however, oversees all military operations in the eastern part of this continent, and I am sure that if you had suspected his value, you would not have let him live. 
 How can one fish-head be that important? 
 The greatest strength of the Overlords, is also their most profound weakness. 
 The Eshpeni, as they are called, have unimaginable intellectual capacity, which means they have no need for computational or information-storage devices, such as computers. 
 They keep everything in their heads? 
 In a manner of speaking, yes. 
 Each one of them controls huge sections of their interplanetary operations. 
 But because they speak through many harnessed species, such as ourselves, our oppressors must keep their plans secret. 
 I don't see how any of this concerns us. 
 General, if that Overlord had been killed, alien operations in this part of the world would have been thrown into complete and utter chaos. 
 Bressler: You still haven't answered why this information is relevant  now. 
 We have gained access, through our operatives, to the Eshpeni's movements. 
 We know when and where he will be and, more importantly, when he will be vulnerable. 
 Where? 
 Ben: A large weapon is being constructed on the 35th parallel not 500 miles from here. 
 What kind of weapon? What's its purpose? 
 We were not able to acquire that information. 
 Besides, it's not relevant for our purposes. 
 What we do know is that the Overlord will be there to inspect its progress three days from now. 
 So, we just walk in and kill the damn thing? 
 Surely there are defense mechanisms in place. 
 On the surface, but... 
 Underground caves and narrow limestone fissures lead right up to the outside of the buried section of the facility. 
 If you have all this information, why do you need us? 
 We cannot enter the area undetected. 
 They will sense our presence because of our harnesses. 
 Also, we lack the weapons needed to breach the compound and eliminate the Overlord. 
 This is why we have exposed ourselves and turned to you for help. 
 Well, uh, that's, uh... a lot of information to digest. 
 We're gonna need some time to sort this out. 
 As you wish. 
 We will wait outside the city. 
 But time is...of the essence, General. 
 A target of opportunity such as this rarely presents itself twice. 
 Agreed. 
 [ Warbling ] 
 You have to leave, too? 
 You can't stay just for a night? 
 Your brothers would love it. 
 I can't. 
 At least not yet. 
 Got to go. 
 Bressler: Gentlemen, I don't mind telling you -- 
 I've never heard a bigger crock of bull crap in my life. 
 Sir, I know how it seems, but, reluctantly, I've come to believe that the rebel Skitters are real. 
 I am not sending my forces on a wild goose chase with some red-eyed monster, no matter how real they may be! 
 General, I've known Dan Weaver and Tom Mason for a long -ell, this discussion is over. 
 Sergeant, take these men back to their cages and secure the outside perimeter. 
 Those damn things come within 10 meters of here, shoot them on sight. 
 Yes, sir. 
 My son is still out there with them. 
 Regrettable, but hardly my responsibility. 
 What happened to "Let's take the fight to the enemy," general? 
 You're out of line, Professor. 
 Sir! 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What is it, Captain? I'm losing my patience here. 
 Weaver: You're right, sir. 
 It's insane to risk Charleston's army for a mission so dangerous. 
 But I do know one fighting unit that's capable of carrying out this mission successfully, and that's the 2nd Mass. 
 Sorry, Captain Weaver, but I'm not willing to risk even  your  sorry unit. 
 It's suicide. 
 We've been living at the razor's edge of death for so long we don't know any different. 
 And besides, you know we're just gonna be a thorn in your backside as long as we hang around here. 
 Am I wrong, Tom? 
 Quite correct, Captain. In fact, I'd make it my career. 
 Fine. 
 Muster your fighters. 
 You can reconnoiter with your Skitter friends outside the complex. 
 Dismissed. 
 Sergeant Clemons, I'm sure I don't have to tell you that we have a target of opportunity here, Sergeant. 
 And it's waiting right outside this complex. 
 You mean the Skitters. 
 Exactly. 
 Get your men ready. 
 I don't want a single Skitter b*st*rd left alive by morning. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Hey, Ben! 
 [ Skitters hiss ] 
 [ Skitter growls ] 
 What are you doing here, Hal? 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Can't a guy see his brother? 
 [ Growls ] 
 [ Clicks ] 
 You're not sleeping like  that, are you? 
 Tried it. Blood rushed to my head, and I passed out. 
 Guess I'm human after all. 
 I-I didn't mean it like that. 
 I'm joking. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Seriously, why did you come here? 
 Seriously, to see you. 
 I know things got a little crazy between us, and, well, um... 
 [ Smacks lips ] 
 I just want to say I'm sorry. 
 For my part in it, I'm -- I'm really sorry. 
 I'm sorry, too. 
 Nothing seems to have made a lot of sense recently, does it? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Amen to that. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Until now. 
 Really? 
 How so? 
 I think I found the place I belong. 
 You mean here -ith the Skitters? 
 Yeah. 
 Your place is with your family, doofus. 
 Hal. 
 No, seriously, listen to me. 
 Dad needs you. 
 I mean, we  all  need you. 
 All right? You had your fun. Now it's time to come home. 
 The world doesn't work that way anymore. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You know, it wasn't that long ago we were fighting side-by-side. 
 We made quite a team, remember? 
 We did. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 But... 
 You're staying. 
 With them. 
 Yes. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Boy, you can be frustrating. 
 I'm a younger brother. That's what we do. 
 I suppose. 
 But, uh... you're so damn good at it. 
 Be careful, okay? 
 You too. 
 Well, this is a short-lived paradise. 
 Honestly, I'm happy to get back on the front line. 
 I never thought I'd say it, but there's something about the... 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 Rush? 
 Yeah. I suppose that's it. 
 Maybe we've just been fighting so long, we don't know anything else. 
 I know... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Um... 
 Ohh... 
 [ Coughing ] 
 [ Retching ] 
 Are you okay? 
 [ Sighs, sniffles ] 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 It's nothing. 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Tom know? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 That I'm pregnant? 
 No. 
 And I'm not gonna tell him till we're back from this mission. 
 Okay. 
 House arrest. 
 [ Book slams ] 
 Could he possibly be more humiliating? 
 I built this community. 
 I invited Bressler here to join us, for God's sake. 
 The general crossed the line. 
 No question. 
 But you got to take some responsibility for what's happened here. 
 Oh, I suppose. I suppose so. 
 Yes, yes, I made some errors in judgment. 
 And the general is not an evil man, Tom. 
 The only problem is that he thinks with his... rifle. 
 Arthur, I've never known you to be one for metaphors. 
 Oh. Well, in this case, apt, no? 
 Without question. 
 When Colonel Porter teamed Dan Weaver and I up together, I thought he was insane. 
 I half expected him to kill me in my sleep. 
 But somehow, some way, we found a middle ground. 
 But we both know the dangers of military rule. 
 Perhaps, but as I've said, we can't just tuck our heads in the sand and pretend the aliens aren't out there. 
 Meaning that you're going on this... suicide mission. 
 Yes. 
 Dad...our camp -e were attacked. 
 Tom: This isn't Red-Eye. 
 I don't see him. Where is he? 
 He and a few others got away. 
 Bressler: You sure you can't get me anything at all on the attackers? 
 Even the smallest detail might be helpful. 
 No. It was dark. All I could see was muzzle flashes. 
 They came from over there. 
 We ran in every direction, and then someone hit me in the head. 
 "We"? 
 You mean... the Skitters? 
 And the other de-harnessed kids. 
 No boot prints. Shell casings everywhere. 
 5.56 and 7.62s. 
 Ehh. 90% of the weapons in Charleston fire these. 
 You know, we came here in trust. 
 All right, all right. Calm down, son. 
 Calm down? He was almost killed. 
 I understand why you're upset, Professor. 
 [ Chuckling ] 
 If he were  my  boy -- 
 It  wasn't  your boy. 
 No. My son was killed by a Skitter. 
 Right in front of me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Almost everyone in Charleston has seen loved ones murdered by those things. 
 Is it any wonder that some got carried away with our emotions? 
 You're not condoning the attack, are you, General? 
 I'm saying what happened  happened. 
 End of story. Game over. 
 I'm canceling the mission. 
 You can't do that! 
 Those are my orders. 
 Dad. 
 We have to go on this mission. 
 This is about more than the rebels, more than the Overlord. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 This weapon will wipe out 
 everything  if it's finished. 
 Red-Eye didn't have any information on the weapon. 
 He didn't know whether he could trust Bressler and the others. 
 I understand. It's just -- 
 I have the plan, the layout in my head. 
 I can -- I can get us there. I can get us in. 
 Captain? 
 Get in and out before they can react. 
 It's gonna be a much smaller team, but...yes. 
 Hell yes. 
 General! 
 What is it? 
 Sir, with all due respect, the 2nd Mass is going on the mission. 
 I just gave you an order. 
 I understand that, sir. 
 But we're doing it nonetheless, with or without your permission. 
 Fine. You've got my permission. 
 Weaver: Sir. 
 Here you go. 
 Weaver: Get your packs loaded! Weapons ready! 
 It's good to see you dressed all normal-like, Cap. 
 You said it, Dai. It enhances the captain's rugged good looks. 
 Yeah, the captain is stylin' now. 
 All right. Stow it. 
 Or...this "stylin'," "rugged," size-11 boot will commence to kicking some ass! 
 
 
 
 Hey, Jeanne, w-what are you doing? 
 What's it look like, Dad? Getting geared up. 
 Oh, no. No, you're not going with us. 
 I think I can handle myself in combat. 
 There's no question about that. 
 You need fighters you can depend on. 
 Yeah. We do, of course. 
 But that's not the point. 
 It  is. 
 You need to be  here -- in Charleston. 
 C-Charleston? 
 No, Dad, my place is by your side -- fighting. 
 Sweetheart... 
 ...the truth is -he real truth -- 
 I can't bear the idea of losing you again. 
 Well, same here. 
 At least we'll die together. 
 It's better than waiting for you to come home. 
 [ Sighs ] Well  somebody's got to survive this war,  finish what's been started here. 
 And you know what? 
 After seeing you stand up to Manchester at the forum... 
 I believe... 
 I  know that you're such a person. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Bu-- I just -- I don't want you to die, papa bear. 
 Aw, don't you worry about that, baby bear. 
 You know your papa's way too ornery to die. 
 I didn't know you could draw. 
 Neither did I. 
 One of the many benefits of being harnessed. 
 I'm impressed. 
 Dai: What's that thing? 
 Well, it's my specialty. I call it "the wall crasher." 
 Say what? 
 Blow a hole in anything, anywhere. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 Finally, after all these months of running, we're taking the fight to  them. 
 Tick, tick... 
 Boom! Boom! 
 We could have used a couple of these babies a while back. 
 Yeah, well, got them  now. That's all that counts. 
 We'll see you on the flip side, Jim. 
 Bring them home. 
 All right, move it! This ain't no coach tour. 
 Really, Cap? I thought we were going to see the Grand Canyon. 
 Hey! 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Bro, you got steel-plated cojones showing up here after putting a hole in my arm. 
 I'm sorry about that, Lyle. I truly am. 
 Clemons was gonna kill you. 
 What happened to your uniform, soldier boy? 
 Threw it in the incinerator. 
 Should have known better than to put it on in the first place. 
 Didn't like what it did to my head. 
 So, you want to take me back, Pope? 
 I got my mind right. 
 Now, what do  you  think I should do with you, Tector? 
 I suppose that's up to you. 
 Indeed it is. 
 Drive the truck. 
 Dad! 
 Tom: Hey, buddy. 
 I wanted to wish you good hunting. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll be back in a couple of days. 
 I know. 
 What else? 
 It's just, uh... well, I thought I'd proved myself as a good fighter. 
 Seriously, you're the best. 
 Then why aren't you taking me with you? 
 Isn't it obvious? 
 Well, no. 
 Lourdes. 
 She's had kind of a tough time lately with Jamil and all. 
 I needed to make sure that there's somebody here that can keep her safe. 
 Oh. 
 Roger that, Dad. 
 You don't have to come with this. 
 You mean just leave the little woman at home while you men go off and fight the big, bad alien? 
 That's not how I meant it. 
 I've seen you around blood, Tom Mason. 
 You turn three shades of green at the sight of it. 
 Wouldn't want anyone bleeding out while I wasn't there to prevent it. 
 Hey. 
 Take care of yourself, okay? 
 Weaver: Let's roll. 
 Don't want to be late for our date with that stinking fish-head. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Thunder rumbles ] 
 This tunnel is endless. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm just not good in tight, cramped places. 
 You should have told me. 
 You could have stayed back at the trucks with Lyle and Crazy Lee. 
 Don't start this again, okay? 
 You're right. I'm sorry. 
 Old habits. 
 Sweet, in a retro sort of way. 
 But...[ Chuckles ] 
 I get it. 
 Enough said. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 I was thinking... 
 Yeah? 
 I was thinking this would be a good place for crawlies. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Thanks for that thought. 
 [ Both grunting ] 
 Seriously, though. 
 If we don't find the exit door to this ride... 
 [ Both breathing heavily ] 
 I just want to say -- 
 Don't. 
 Okay? We're gonna make it. We always do. 
 But, Hal, what if we don't? 
 We will. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Ben: The chamber's on the other side of the wall. 
 It matches the layout. 
 Go on and set her up. Come on. 
 Dad... 
 He's here. I can feel it. 
 Okay. 
 We'll go face the b*st*rd together, make sure he doesn't get off the planet alive. 
 [ Guns cocking ] 
 Weaver: How we doing, boys? 
 A few more seconds. 
 All right. 
 Hold on to your butts. 
 Fire in the hole. 
 Back up. Back up. 
 [ Warbling ] 
 Aliens had to hear that. 
 So, where are they? 
 Oh, you can bet they'll be along directly. 
 [ Rumbling, warbling ] 
 Which way, Ben? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Anthony, Maggie, get the C-4. 
 Yes, sir. All right. 
 Tom. 
 You take Ben, Hal, Maggie, Anne, Dai to the left. 
 The rest of you are coming with me to the right. 
 We're gonna start laying out those charges. 
 We're gonna meet back at the cave entrance. 
 We're gonna blow this whole thing and the Overlord to high hell. 
 Okay, let's do it -ronto. 
 Go, go, go. 
 Divvy it up. 
 [ Zipper opens ] 
 It's pointing up at the sky. 
 I know. 
 Why? They already wiped out the Air Force. 
 It wasn't meant for humans. 
 [ Warbling ] 
 Skitters! 
 [ Skitters screeching ] 
 [ Skitters growling ] 
 Professor Mason? 
 What an unpleasant surprise. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Anne, are you all right? 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Yeah. I'm okay. 
 I think it's safe to say Dr. Glass will never be okay again, Tom. 
 Don't listen to her, Dad! She's just trying to -- mm! 
 That'll be enough, Ben! 
 My master has tried to be so patient with you, Tom. 
 But he finds you a constant nuisance. 
 I'm glad to be of service. 
 Must have scared the hell out of him, though. 
 What, was he afraid to show his ugly face? 
 On the contrary. 
 He's right here. 
 He's quite curious how you found this facility and knew we would be here. 
 I bet he is. 
 You'll tell us -verything. 
 You might as well just get it over with and kill me, 'cause I'm not gonna tell you a damn thing. 
 You're going to die, Tom. 
 [ Skitter clicks ] 
 As will all of you. 
 I'm afraid my master will insist on it. 
 But first, I'm sure you remember this... 
 [ Clicking ] 
 ...and the pain it can inflict. 
 [ Breathing shakily ] 
 [ Electricity crackling ] 
 [ Screams ] 
 Karen! Stop it! 
 Aah! 
 [ Groans ] 
 I've been wanting to do this for quite some time now. 
 Get away from him! 
 [ Hal grunting ] 
 Hal! 
 Tell us everything you know. 
 [ Strained ] 
 Go to hell. 
 We'll save Dr. Glass for last, I think. 
 For old times' sake. 
 [ Electricity crackling ] 
 [ Screams ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 That the best you got? 
 [ Electricity crackles ] 
 [ Screaming ] 
 Is he enjoying watching you torture us? 
 Karen: He doesn't care any more about you than you would care about a mosquito buzzing around your face, Tom. 
 You're just an irritant to him. 
 I was hoping to avoid this. 
 [ Gasping ] 
 No! Don't touch me! 
 [ Gasping ] 
 [ Whimpering ] 
 She's pregnant, Tom. 
 She's pregnant with your child. 
 Oh. 
 You didn't know. 
 [ Anne crying ] 
 All right! I'll tell you whatever you want to know! 
 Just, please, don't. 
 [ Skitter screeches ] 
 Hal?! 
 Hal, you're gonna be fine! 
 [ Skitters screeching, growling ] 
 [ Screeches ] 
 [ Screeches ] 
 [ Overlord groans ] 
 [ Overload screeches ] 
 Karen: It's not over, Tom! 
 You'll never win! 
 Never! 
 [ Hisses, clicks ] 
 W-we'll go get help. 
 [ Clicking ] 
 [ Clicking ] 
 [ Voice breaking ] 
 I understand. 
 [ Moaning ] 
 [ Coughs ] 
 [ Gasping ] 
 [ Clicking ] 
 We have to go. 
 Anthony, Pope, get those charges ready. 
 Everybody else, move to the cave. 
 We're gonna blow this pop stand. 
 Tector, give me a hand with Dai's body. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Maggie: Help me with Hal. He's hurt bad. 
 Mission accomplished, sir. 
 All right, get these people some food! 
 In fact, get them any damn thing they want! 
 [ Cheers and applause ] 
 Well done, Dan. 
 I can't tell you how proud I am of the 2nd Mass. 
 Wasn't pretty, but we got it done. 
 Although, we lost Dai. 
 He was a good man. 
 Matt: Dad! Ben! 
 Was it cool? 
 That's one word for it. 
 So, are you staying? With us, I mean? 
 Matt, Ben's got important work to do. 
 Of course I'm staying. 
 In fact, I was thinking we should get a killer game of Monopoly going, if you think you can beat me. 
 You know I can, sucker-fish. 
 I'm not exactly sure what's wrong. 
 He might have a slight concussion, but his vital signs are normal, and he's breathing on his own. 
 Meaning what? 
 Meaning nothing, really. 
 We just [sighs] have to wait and see what happens. 
 Right now, I think it's best if we just let him rest, okay? 
 I promise I'll keep an eye on him. 
 So... 
 So...? 
 You're pregnant. 
 I was gonna tell you, but... 
 Um... How do  you  feel about it? 
 I'm not sure. 
 You? 
 [ Smacks lips ] 
 When I think about it, I'm...happy. 
 What? 
 I don't know. I just... 
 I wonder how fair it is to bring a child into this kind of world. 
 If there's any future for us... for  any  of us... 
 How can we not? 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 Aah. 
 Ah. The conquering hero. 
 Or prodigal son? 
 Never. 
 It's good to have you back, safe, in one piece. 
 I'm so sorry to hear about your son. 
 Yes. 
 We can only hope. 
 Of course. Of course. 
 Well, you have my prayers -nd every resource of this facility. 
 Much appreciated. 
 Would you like a drink? 
 No, thank you. 
 Sure? 
 Scotch -- neat. 
 I hear that Bressler's agreed to restore civil rule. 
 Yes, well, there's a caveat to his agreement. 
 It's on condition that  I  no longer hold the office of majority leader. 
 I see. 
 Truth be told, I'm happy to comply. 
 It's a job better-suited to a younger man, someone such as yourself. 
 Arthur, I can't. 
 I'm flattered, but no. 
 I'll stay around for as long as it takes Hal to recover, but Captain Weaver and I have already agreed -- 
 Charleston's not the place for the 2nd Mass. 
 That's not the answer I was hoping for. 
 I know, and I'm sorry. 
 But when those bastards are gone, Arthur, I promise I will be the first to get out my old hammer and start beating my sword into the best damn plowshare you ever saw. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 But until that day... 
 I'll fight. 
 Not because I  want  to, but because I  have  to. 
 How'd he take it? 
 Not well. 
 So? 
 So I think the sooner we get out of here, the better. 
 Yeah. 
 We've come a long way, you and I. 
 Yes, we have. 
 And I don't exactly know what's out there -or me, for the 2nd Mass. 
 No, me neither. 
 But whatever it is, I'd just as soon we did it together, like a team. 
 You know? 
 I do. A-- 
 [ rumbling ] 
 [ Alarm blaring ] 
 Earthquake?! 
 No! Not an earthquake! 
 [ Thunder crashing ] 
 [ Blaring continues ] 
 [ Warbling ] 
 [ Warbling continues ] 
 What the hell are those? 
 Nothing we've ever seen before. 
 [ Warbling ] 
 [ Whirring ]
