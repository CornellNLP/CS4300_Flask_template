 Narrator: Previously on  Falling Skies... 
 The harness, is a process. 
 And Ben isn't free from it. 
 Looking for you family? 
 I combed that rubble for a long time... but they were gone. 
 What were you and Jimmy doing hunting Skitters, Ben? 
 I need a reason? 
 I'm sorry. He's gone. 
 You want out? 
 There's the door. 
 I can't protect them anymore. We can't protect them anymore.

Young Bloods 
Original Air Date on July 1, 2012 
 [ Thudding ] 
 Hal: You see that steam? 
 And the lights on? it's none of our concern. 
 Our orders are to find the safest way to Charleston, which means we'll steer a wide path around this place. 
 You've been quiet lately. 
 Got nothing to say. 
 You eat by yourself, you barely sleep. 
 It's like you're a different person. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 We all miss Jimmy. 
 But you got to figure out a way to put that behind you. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Hey! 
 Those are our bikes! 
 Can you believe that? 
 Where the hell did they come from? 
 We're not going back to camp without those bikes. 
 [ Motorcycle engine revving ] 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm just trying something. 
 They're headed east. 
 How do you know? 
 I can hear their engines. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Take those in to the mess for me. 
 Thank you. 
 Look at me. 
 Good news. 
 Aliens left? 
 Who told you? 
 I wanted to be the first. I thought you'd be so impressed. 
 Ha, ha. 
 So did you actually have good news? 
 A chocopie? 
 Where did you get this? 
 My unit found a Korean grocery that hadn't even been touched. 
 We got enough food for a week. 
 Mm! 
 And I remember you saying that you really liked those when you were a kid. 
 I was addicted. 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 These things kept me rolling in baby fat till I hit high school. 
 I never thought I'd have anything like this again. 
 Me neither. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, sorry. Um... 
 No, that's -- 
 Don't mind me. I'm just, um... 
 No, it's okay. I got to go find, uh... 
 Matt! I sent him on his first mission today. 
 Well, then, I'm -'m just gonna go -- 
 Okay. 
 [ Sighs deeply ] 
 [ Child screams playfully ] 
 [ Children conversing indistinctly ] 
 [ Diego speaking indistinctly ] 
 Diego: Well, we'll find some. 
 Now that we got enough wheels to get out of this hell hole. 
 Jeanne: Maybe we could go to the Blue Mountains. 
 Lots of wildlife. 
 Be nice to have some fresh meat for a change. 
 Julian: What do you know about hunting? 
 More than you. 
 My dad used to take my sister and me. 
 [ Two knocks ] 
 [ Guns cock ] 
 Hal: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
 I just want to talk about the bikes. 
 15 to 1? There's nothing to talk about. 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 Get the hell out. 
 I'd back off if I were you. 
 Yeah? 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 Yeah. 
 Now, if they don't stand down in 5 seconds, you die. 
 1... 
 2... 
 Dale lo que quiere. 
 Pero necesitamos esas motos. 3... Diego... 4... Stand down. Put your guns down. All of you -ut your guns on the ground. Diego? That's your name? Well, I'm Hal. And that's my brother, Ben. Just take the bikes and go. It's just you guys here? No adults? We don't need them. Adults get us killed. We look out for each other. Our people are camped out not far from here. We might be able to spare some extra bike parts. At the very least, food and water. You all look like you could use a good meal, no offense. Say yes. Hilary, Sean, Julian, and Rob, come with us to check it out. The rest of you... hold down the fort. We'll be back as soon as possible. Thanks. Boon: All right, all right. Yo, it's like this. Check it out. [ Beatboxing ] ♪ Yo, our homeboy Matt, went down the alley ♪ ♪ and was like, "oh, snap!" ♪ ♪ finna put these Skitters in a trap ♪ ♪ make them feel they the mack ♪ ♪ till we hit them in the back with a tick tick boom! ♪ ♪ and those Skitters went splat! ♪ [ Laughter ] Whoo! That wasn't bad. Hey. Hey. Yo, what gives, mason jar? He's 9 years old. Beer? Use your head. Little man's just on cup-holder duty. We're celebrating. Yeah? Two more kills this morning, boss. Really? Yeah? Dad, it was so awesome! I led two Skitters all by myself into Tector's field of fire. What do you mean you "led"? He was just supposed to be a runner. "Report back to camp if you saw any alien activity." We saw an opportunity, seized the initiative. [ Bottle clatters ] And used my son as Skitter bait? They were boxed in, man. It was fish in a barrel. Dad, it's not a big -atthew. Look, Teck and I have killed more Skitters than anybody else. Shut up, Boon. The man's right. We screwed up. No, we didn't. A screw-up is if we miss. What if you had missed? Our job is not to miss. Hey, you're 20 years old! You were selling cellphones a year ago! What if you had missed?! We don't miss -oon! My orders were clear -an an observation post, not paint a target on my 9-year-old's back! You can take that Barrett rifle and give it to the second team. You're off sniper duty. And you can both go join the sanitation crew until further notice. Dismissed. Let's go. You're gonna sit out the next couple of missions, Matt. Great. You've ruined everything. Whoa. Trouble in paradise? Discipline issue. Nothing I can't handle. [ Vehicle approaches ] Must be Hal and Ben. Weaver: What do we have here? Found them holed up in a warehouse. Half-starved. No adults. Maybe we can help them out. Jeanne? Dad. Jeanne?! [ Crying ] Daddy. Jeanne! My girl. Jeanne. How did she die? Stroke. She ran out of her blood-pressure medication. Mom always forgot to refill it. I used to do it for her. Me too. After you guys split. I thought about you a lot. I figured you were dead. I came looking for you, Jeanne. For you, and for your mother, and for... for your sister. Wish I'd gotten there sooner. We're together now. That's all that matters. I missed you, papa bear. I missed you, too, baby bear. [ Whistle blows ] [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Cheering ] And what else? Did you spot the factory on Barnard and High Street? Yeah, now, we saw that one. Lots of battle bots there. Kids with those parasites on their backs, and chinches, too. Chinches? The big bugs. Oh, no, yeah. We call 'em Skitters. Oh. My bad. [ Chuckles ] I'm gonna get you back. That your girlfriend? No. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Nah. We're just friends. [ Chuckles ] You're kidding, right? That girl just kicked a soccer ball in your face and you're smiling like you just won the lottery? Nah. Hey, Dad. Diego was just giving us some great intel on our way down to Charleston. Good. What's in Charleston, anyway? Rumors of survivors organizing a pretty substantial force against the invasion. Your group's welcome to join us if you want. We'll think about it. Truck's ready if you want to start loading your supplies. Jamil scrounged up some bike parts. You might be able to fix yours with. Sorry we can't give you more, but we're pretty thin as it is. It's more than all right. [ Speaking in Spanish ] All right. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Matt. Hey, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you yesterday. No, you aren't. Matt. What? I know you want to be a fighter, but you got a lot to learn. Following orders, for starters. I did a good job. I killed two Skitters. You could have gotten yourself killed in the process. It wasn't smart. Well, neither was getting onto an alien spaceship, Dad. You remember these, from your volleyball tournaments? You were a hit. Mm-hmm. [ Chuckles ] We're gonna go load up the truck, if you want to come help. I'll be there in a minute. Daddy, did you meet Diego? Not properly. I'm Dan. I've heard a lot about you. Hey, uh... Te veo afuera, chiquita. Sí, mi Amor. Nos vemos ahorita. You speakin' Spanish now? Yes, Dad. I speak Spanish. He's my boyfriend. Friendly guy. He's just being protective. Protective? Of what? You just got to get to know him. Be open-minded, okay? I am open-minded. [ Chuckles ] Since when? Iapurenle! While I'm still young, people! Iya hay que darle matarile a esto! Diego. Hey, what's wrong? I can't talk. Sorry. Hey. Hi. Nice hat. You a baseball fan? No. I just found it. You're the kid who helped kill those chinches yesterday, huh? Skitters. Yeah, that was me. [ Chuckles ] Sounded pretty cool, man. It was. I was on my scooter and I saw two Skitters but pretended like I didn't, and then I led them into Boon and Tector's field of fire, and they shot their heads off, and they exploded like... Bashoo! Bashoo! That's pretty good. We're loaded. Weaver: Oh. I was thinking maybe I should go with you. Don't worry, Dad. I'll be fine. You're just dropping the supplies, and you're coming right back. We'll be gone an hour, tops. You coming? Of course. Ahora, mount up, manitos! I'm gonna get you back. You know that, right? Is that a fact? [ Chuckles ] [ Groans ] 
 
 Yes, I like to say, "vengeance is mine, saith the Hal." This doesn't look good. [ Indistinct conversation ] Somebody ripped up our place. Robbie's jacket. [ Jonny sobs in distance ] Somebody, help! [ Coughing ] Jonny, are you all right? [ Crying ] Chinches. Skitters. They took everybody. Hey, buddy, how long ago was this? I don't know. They're gonna be harnessed. [ Sobs ] That factory, right here. That's where we've seen a lot of harnessed kids. And that's the building we saw in the scouting unit yesterday. The building has power. And Mechs guarding it. Maybe they turned the factory into a harness facility. Would explain the security. Okay. Ben. What do you remember about the place where you were harnessed? Um, not much. Just fragments. Anything you can remember will be helpful. Um... first, they kept us in a holding room. Weaver: For how long? I don't know. What else? They took us to the harnessing chamber. What was the distance between the holding room and the harnessing chamber? I'm sorry. I don't remember. All right, look. We're wasting time. We know they're in there. Let's go. Not so fast. We need a plan. Improvising gets people killed. Yeah? While you're sitting around making plans, they're harnessing our friends. I'm not gonna put people's lives at risk so that you can go off half-cocked. Fine. Stay here with your maps. I'm going in. I said no. I don't take orders from anyone, especially a man who couldn't save his own family. Hey! You listen to me, there, Sonny boy -eanne: Dad, stop! You do not talk to me about my family! I said stop it! You hear me? Stop! Stop! I told you he hasn't changed. [ Breathing heavily ] Jeanne, I am sorry. If you were sorry, you'd try to be different. You wouldn't be the same angry control freak. This is exactly why mom kicked you out. Jeanne. [ Indistinct conversations ] Finally. What's the word? We're going after them. What about the 2nd Mass? Yeah, aren't you supposed to wait for Weaver and my dad? I don't need anyone's permission to go get my own people. Vamos. You okay? Yeah. Good man. What about you, Skitter killer? There's room for one more. Grab your weapons and gear up. We move out in five. Ben, you don't have to go along on this one. What are you talking about? Just, you going back to a harness facility, I'm a little worried. Worried I might freak out at a critical moment? No. No one's thinking that. Good. Because I'm going. Just wanted to let you know you you had a choice. Okay. Thanks. You got a spare shotgun? You all right? Everything she said is true. I've never been able to control my anger. Sweeps through me like a brush fire. If I'd been a better husband, a better father, her mother and her sister might still be alive. There's nothing I can do about it now. Yeah, there is. Talk to her the way you're talking to me. Yeah. Take me with you, boss. You're benched, Tector. Please. I never should have put your boy at risk. Give me a chance to make it right. All right. Grab a weapon. But you're back on sanitation detail tomorrow. Yes, sir. Matt! Matt! Tom: What's wrong? Can't find Matt. He's not in our tent, he's not in the mess tent. I don't know where he is. He's gone. Jeanne too. All the bikes are gone. They went without us? Come on. [ Mech thudding ] That's Matt's hat. You think the cockroaches got them? Only one way to find out. Maggie, Dai, Tector, you go in the back. We'll go in the front. Let's go! Don't go loud unless you have to. Let's go! Don't know the layout of this place or what we're walking into. Maggie: There's no time to worry about that. [ Liquid spraying ] [ Liquid flowing ] [ Screaming in distance ] Jonny: Help. Jeanne? J-Jonny? It's me, Jeanne. W-where are we? Just try to breathe slowly. I'm right here with you. [ Sobbing in distance ] [ Breathing rapidly ] [ Groans ] What's he doing?! I'm here, Jonny. [ Screaming ] Jeanne! [ Groans ] [ Sobbing ] Get it off! Get it off! Jeanne! Damn you, Chinches! Go to hell! [ Crying ] [ Grunts ] [ Screaming in distance continues ] [ Sobbing ] [ Crying ] [ Speaks Spanish ] They took the others away. We need to go after them. No! No! Dad! [ Whimpers ] Let me go! Ugh! Hey! Sounds like our team already found them. Matt. [ Gunfire ] Jeanne! Daddy! Jeanne! I'm right here, baby. Hurry up. Hurry, Dad. I'm here. I'm here. It's okay. Weaver: You all right? Yes. Daddy! Hey, I'm here. I'm sorry. I should have listened to you. You're okay. That's all that matters. Ben. We're out of here. [ Screeching ] Follow me. Don't look back. Don't you think you could have thrown a grenade over there? Are you okay? You think you could get him loose? We got to wag it and shag it. We're gonna have beaucoup Skitters coming any second. Ugh! Ugh! Son of a -- God. Ow! [ Groans ] Ugh. I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay. We got to go. Let's go! I'm okay! What is that? Another pain pill? Antibiotics, to prevent infection. You getting paid to push 'em? [ Chuckles ] Take the pill. [ Groans ] All right. Hey. I'll check in on you a little later? Come on in. How's the leg? Oh, it's just a scratch. It's stupid. [ Chuckles ] Jeanne... the things that you said before... Forget them. No. You were right. I...I let you down. And... you deserved better. Doesn't matter now, Dad. I want to make it up to you. You already did. You're not angry? I'm gonna be honest. You weren't a great dad. But you're an incredible leader. And the older I get, the more I appreciate that. I'm gonna change, Jeanne. I mean it. For you. I know. [ Sighs ] Thank you. I guess that your friends are getting ready to leave, huh? They wanted me to thank you for the extra supplies. They really liked all of you. Even Diego. Yeah. But they don't want be part of the resistance. They think they have a better chance of surviving by avoiding the aliens and finding a place to hole up. Well, they may be right. You're gonna miss Diego, aren't you? Yeah. I'm gonna miss him a lot. [ Voice breaking ] I don't want to say goodbye. Well, hey, come here. Come here. It's all right. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. It's all right, sweetheart. It's hard, I know. I know. Yeah, it is. Oh, listen, I, uh... before I forget... [ Sighs ] I have something. [ Chuckles ] Your compass. Yeah. Remember the time we were tracking that buck up in the Berkshires and lost track of time? Mm-hmm. Sun went down, and we had to make our way back to camp. Compass. Mom was furious. "You know better than that, Dan!" Yeah, well, she was right. You know what? I'm... I'm sorry. I think my meds are gonna -ust kicking in. [ Chuckles ] Hmm. I'll let you rest. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Sighs ] How's it going? Quiet. No sign that the Skitters followed us. Look what I got a hold of. So, how long's this been going on? What? Come on, Ben. In the harnessing facility... I saw your spikes glow. You're mistaken. Really? That's how you want to play this? You're just gonna lie about it? Hope it goes away instead of getting worse? Yes! That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Who here is gonna understand glowing spikes? Half of these people still think I killed Jimmy. You can rat me out if you want, but I am not signing my own death warrant. And I am your brother. And all I'm trying to do is help. I know. But you need to back off. [ Footsteps approach ] [ Clears throat ] Uh... You want to see me, boss? Yes, I did. That's the unit's laundry. I want you to wash it. Yes, sir. When you're finished with that, you can stop by the armory tent and pick up the Barrett rifle. I'm putting you back on sniper duty. Yes, sir. I want you to do something for me, though. Keep Boon in line. Don't you worry, boss. He step out of line, I'll put my boot so far up his butt he'll taste shoe leather. [ Indistinct conversations ] What's going on, Lo? [ Sighs ] Why don't you let me in on it? Maybe I could help. [ Clears throat ] I had an aunt and uncle in Parras. It's this tiny town in the middle of nowhere, Northern Mexico. And I-I always ask new people if they've heard any news of survivors. Okay. And I asked Diego... and he said it was wiped out. And of course it is, you know? I don't know why I was hoping they'd somehow survived. I'm an idiot. Lo, you're not an idiot. And -- and I'm sorry about your family, but...it doesn't mean you stop hoping, it just means you got to hope for something else. You know, for Charleston. For a new life one day, a new family. Hope's all we got. [ Sniffles ] Jeanne: "Dad, I'm sorry. "But I'm not coming with you to Charleston. "I said some terrible things, "but I want you to know this has nothing to do with that. "I have my own life now with Diego and the other kids. "And while I'd love to come with you, "I know that they need me like the 2nd Mass needs you. "I'm sorry to say goodbye this way. "But if I told you in person, "we both know you'd never let me go. "I love you, papa bear. Always and forever, baby bear." [ Sobs ]
