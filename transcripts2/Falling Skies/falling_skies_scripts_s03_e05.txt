 Narrator: Previously on  Falling Skies... 
 This alliance that you've created with this new set of aliens is a load of crap. 
 They have given us no cause to doubt their loyalty. 
 What is going on with you?! 
 I've been going to see Karen. 
 She implanted something in me. 
 I don't think she's human. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I work for the real President, Benjamin Hathaway. 
 If Benjamin Hathaway is alive, we don't know where he is. 
 The Espheni are coming. We're all gonna die. 
 Hey, let me fight!

 [ Knocking on door ] 
 What's going on? 
 I don't know. 
 [ Knocking continues ] 
 What's up? 
 It's Anne and Alexis. 
 What about them? 
 They're missing. 
 Kadar: Dr. Glass asked me to analyze the DNA of 12 de-harnessed children. 
 11 presented with no abnormalities whatsoever. 
 But one showed signs of alien DNA, the strands intertwining with human DNA like kudzu in a Northwestern rainforest. 
 It's a vine-like plant in the genus pueraria -- 
 Doctor, please. The point. 
 The baby...Is not human. 
 So...she's an alien? 
 No, she's a hybrid, a-an entirely new species. 
 At least, that's my preliminary analysis. 
 After Dr. Glass left Dr. Kadar, she went back to her room, drugged Lourdes, and, as far as we can tell, she took Alexis, but we don't know where. 
 We were having a glass of wine, and...the -he next thing I knew, C-Colonel Weaver was shaking me awake. 
 So... she just disappeared? 
 Seems that way. 
 And they're not in Charleston anywhere? 
 We've searched everywhere. 
 Dr. Glass wouldn't just run away. That's not like her. 
 It's possible she was afraid what would happen if people found out about the baby. 
 I think she just did what any mother would do. 
 I agree -- Anne is not the type of person who goes around knocking people out or -- or drugging them. 
 Colonel, if she's in the badlands -e're gonna need a search party. 
 Won't need more than 50, maybe 100 volunteers. 
 Colonel. 
 Travel by horseback -over more ground that way. 
 Colonel Weaver! 
 Ms. Peralta. 
 A moment, please. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I need you to get some perspective here. 
 On what, Ms. Peralta? 
 You know we can't afford 100 people for a search party. 
 We can't afford 50 people or 20 people. 
 We can't afford anyone. 
 We're talking about Anne Glass and her newborn daughter, Tom Mason's newborn daughter. 
 I understand that. 
 I'm not sure you do. 
 I most certainly do, but there are 5,000 other lives that I have to consider. 
 Now, if you want to go look for her, and I assume you do, you have my blessing. 
 I can't conduct an effective search by myself. 
 You know that. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's my final decision. 
 Ms. Peralta, when Tom left you in charge, I don't think that he counted on -- 
 Counted on what, Colonel? 
 Looking out for the best interest of Charleston? 
 Because I believe that's exactly what he was counting on from me, and from you, as well. 
 Ms. Peralta. 
 I can't expect you to understand what we in the 2nd Mass went through, but we came out of it a family, a family dedicated to each other, come what may. 
 And that's what the 2nd Mass has come to stand for. 
 That's what we've been fighting for. 
 And if one of us is lost, we find them, and if one of us is in trouble, we help them. 
 Fine. 24 hours. 
 All right, then. And if you do find them, we'll need to figure out a way how to handle the baby. 
 What do you mean, "handle"? Dr. Glass was right. 
 God knows how people will react to a hybrid child. 
 First things first. 
 Yes, first things first. 
 And by the way... 
 I had a family, too... 
 Once. 
 I completely understand what we're fighting for -ompletely. 
 [ Pope coughing ] 
 What happened? 
 We crashed. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Bressler? 
 Dead. 
 You pulled me out of that thing? 
 [ Warbling ] 
 Didn't take them long to find us. 
 Or Keystone for that matter. 
 Yeah, well, considering the fact that you led them right to it, I'm surprised it took them as long as it did. 
 Could have let you burn on that plane. 
 Charleston has a mole. Everybody knows it. 
 Only instead of delaying your trip to Keystone to find out who the damn spy was, you -- you wanted to go and play with the big boys, didn't you? 
 Parley with the President of the United States. 
 Well, I hope it was worth it, huh? 
 You get the President killed, Bressler's dead. 
 [ Grunts ] And I'm out a damn fine airplane. Geez. 
 It looks like they're leaving. We got to move. 
 No, stay here for a while, all right? Wait until they leave. 
 Suit yourself. 
 No! Down! 
 Stay down! 
 [ Warbling ] 
 Listen, if there's one thing I know, it's how to hide from the authorities, all right? 
 Let's just stay here. We wait it out until they pass. 
 [ Warbling ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 You're not leaving me behind. 
 Come on, buddy. It's not safe out there. 
 I don't care. 
 Anne and Alexis are just as important to me as anyone else. 
 Well, you're not going. And that's that. 
 Damn it! 
 Hey! Watch your language, son. 
 Now, what's going on here? 
 Hal said that I couldn't go, but I said -- 
 Of course you're coming with. 
 Sir -- 
 No buts about it, Hal. 
 Matt's coming. That's an order. 
 He can ride with me. 
 I'll make sure nothing happens to him. 
 Right. 
 Let's go. 
 Colonel. 
 Ms. Peralta. 
 Listen, I didn't mean to come across as -- as un-- 
 I got what you were saying, Ms. Peralta. 
 What I wanted to say --I wa-ust get yourself back to Charleston safely, Colonel. 
 We can't do without you. 
 She likes you, dad. 
 Who? Ms. Peralta? That woman hates me. 
 Dad. 
 What? 
 Let's head out! 
 [ Horse whinnies ] 
 [ Clicks tongue ] 
 [ Screeching ] 
 Let's go. 
 Which way? 
 South, back to Charleston. 
 How the hell do you know that south ain't that way? 
 Moss. 
 Grows on the north -ess sun. 
 South. 
 Very good. 
 But you also know that Charleston has got to be, what, 400 miles as the crow flies? 
 So, even if we're covering three miles an hour, times 10 hours a day, if we find a road -ctually, they'll be looking for the road, so we can't even -- 
 Lieutenant Fisher didn't give us the coordinates till we were airborne. 
 What? 
 Spy couldn't have known where we were going. 
 He didn't have the coordinates. We didn't have the coordinates. 
 He knew we were going. He didn't need to know where. 
 Look, Professor, you know as well as I do, they got -hey got eyes in the sky, right? 
 Then why did it take them so long to get to Keystone? 
 You are the  King  of chaos, Mason. 
 Do you know that? It follows you. 
 Don't try to explain it. Just own it. 
 You still owe me an airplane. 
 What you got, son? 
 Blood. 
 Dismount. 
 Jeanne, Maggie, Hal, spread out. 
 It's still fresh. 
 Up here! 
 No! 
 [ Panting ] 
 Weaver: Matt, stay! 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's not Anne. 
 Skitters? 
 Could be. I'm not sure. 
 We need to bury her. 
 We don't even know her. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 No, Matt's right. We can't just leave her here. 
 Come on, Hal. Come give us a hand. 
 [ Slurps ] 
 Ohh, God. 
 We should put up here for the night. 
 No, we should keep moving. 
 Still got a couple hours of light left. Let's go. 
 No, we should make a fire. We need to eat something. 
 Look, in case you missed the memo, fire...Is what attracts them, see? 
 We could die of exposure, starvation, and then it wouldn't matter. 
 Are you going soft, Mason? It's not that cold. 
 It will be when the sun goes down. 
 Make a fire. 
 Yeah, while you do what? 
 What's the matter, Pope? You don't know how? 
 Hey, you know what? 
 You want your fire bad enough there, Mr. Boy Scout, you make it yourself. 
 You  don't  know how, do you? 
 How could you survive this long without knowing how to make a fire? 
 I just got this image of young Tommy Mason out there in the wilderness with his old man. 
 Huh? 
 "Behold, my son, the miracle of fire." 
 I just got an image... 
 Of a young Johnny Pope sitting on his ass making wisecracks while the other kids played. 
 My father wasn't really the outdoorsman type. 
 Too busy managing his stock portfolio, huh? 
 Owned a hardware store. 
 Never made it past the 7th grade. 
 But he knew his tools. 
 Well, sounds like my Norman Rockwell upbringing. 
 My father was a drunk. 
 Angry, mean drunk. 
 There was nothing idyllic about my childhood. 
 [ Blowing ] 
 Except that maybe I survived it. 
 [ Fire crackling ] 
 Matt: It's for the tree. 
 [ Weaver sighs ] 
 Ben: Think we should say...something? 
 All right. 
 I don't know who this woman was. 
 She didn't deserve to die this way. 
 And she's in a better place. Amen. 
 I'm glad we found her. 
 Do you think she had a family? 
 Yeah. Probably. 
 Bet she was a good mother. 
 Yeah, I'm guessing so. 
 Probably just... looking for food for her kids. 
 Like a good mother would. 
 Before all this, probably would have... taken her daughter for ice cream after a volleyball game, even if she [chuckling] lost. 
 She waited up for her daughter to come home from her first date. 
 Not 'cause she was worried about her, but...because she wanted to hear all about it. 
 She'll be missed. 
 But she'll always be loved. 
 Right. Let's get her covered up. 
 Dr. Kadar? 
 Roger? 
 Marina! I know why you're here. 
 You do? 
 And I think I have everything almost ready. 
 Wh-- I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Uh, testing. 
 What testing? 
 Lourdes -- uh, that is to say, Dr. Delgado, gave me a list of all the children born in the last six months here in Charleston -ight to be exact including, of course, Dr. Glass' child. 
 And then it was just a matter of comparing the DNA samples. 
 Doctor, that's a very important project, and I'd like to discuss it further, but that's not why I'm here. 
 All right. 
 I'm, uh...I'm sorry. What is it? 
 This is what the Volm are building. 
 Yes. How did you know? 
 It's not hard to figure out. 
 Where did you get these photos? 
 That's not important. 
 What is important and what I hope you can tell me is what this thing does exactly. 
 "Exactly"? From these photos? 
 Well, you're the only one I could think of who could possibly figure it out. 
 All right. I'll try. 
 That's all I can ask. 
 Marina... 
 Yes. 
 ...does Tom Mason know about this? 
 Yes. 
 He's the one who asked me to come here. 
 Matt. 
 Not hungry. 
 You should eat anyway. 
 Do you think mom died alone? 
 Like...that woman? 
 Um... 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 I hope not. 
 You remember the last time you saw mom? 
 Yeah. 
 I...saw her leaving that morning just... through the window. 
 All I could see was the bottom of her legs from where I was sitting, her jeans, pink Nikes dad got her for that cancer run. 
 Yeah, I...I remember. 
 The next time I saw her, she was lying on the picnic table in the backyard after dad had gone and found her. 
 One of her shoes was missing. 
 I should have gone to look for that shoe. 
 We're gonna find her, right? 
 Anne, I mean. 
 We're gonna try. 
 
 
 
 Hey. Eat. 
 Thanks. 
 For what? 
 For not lying. 
 Pope: Huh? I'll tell you, a little white wine, lemon and garlic, cayenne pepper, it'd be almost edible. 
 You much of a cook, Mason? 
 No. Rebecca did most of the cooking. 
 I used to make breakfast for the boys... 
 On Saturdays sometimes. 
 I liked the smell of bacon and hash browns in the house. 
 Hmm. I wasn't much of a cook when my kids were around. 
 That's right. You've got two, right? 
 A boy and a girl. Brandon and Tanya. 
 When was the last time you saw them? 
 Oh, right. 
 It was five years before the invasion. 
 Me and, uh -- me and my boy were working on his minibike. 
 Had this sweet, little, old-school Honda that his uncle gave him. 
 And, uh, swapping out the rear sprocket... 
 Give the kid a little extra torque, you know? 
 He's riding down the driveway, and this jackass... 
 In a Cadillac -y  that  much, man. 
 Almost just run him right down, right? 
 I told this guy before. 
 So, I throw Brandon into the truck. 
 We follow this son of a bitch, get out to his house. 
 He gets out of his car. 
 I tell him, "hey, man, we got kids playing in the street." 
 He tells me, "yeah, well, get a haircut. 
 Shut your pie hole." 
 And I popped him. 
 So he goes down. 
 And, uh... 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I actually - started laughing 'cause his -is, uh -- his head sounded like a melon... when it hit the asphalt. 
 I'll never forget the look on Brandon's face, though, boy. 
 Just -- I was just trying to teach him how to stand up for yourself, you know? 
 That's -hat's all I was doing. 
 What happened to the guy? He sue you? 
 No, he bled out on the driveway. 
 He ended up dead. 
 You know what, Mason? 
 I was never cut out for the...the homelife... homeowner crap. 
 Just never my thing, you know? 
 And prison -rison was easy. 
 Prison, I-I understood. 
 You know, that other stuff... 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 I was just gonna take the first watch. 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little tired of frog legs. 
 I thought we'd go epicurean this morning. 
 You think that's funny? 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Ain't nothing funny about eating snake, man. 
 Asshole. 
 It's a  joke,  you puss. 
 Oh, you think we're friends now? 
 Share a few campfire stories, and now we're blood brothers? 
 [ Both grunting ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Chittering ] 
 [ Chittering continues ] 
 [ Screeches ] 
 [ Screeches ] 
 [ Screeching ] 
 Move it, Mason! Move it! 
 [ Screeches ] 
 They're flanking us. 
 [ Panting ] 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It was nice knowing you, Mason. 
 Get out of the way. 
 No, no, no. I saw that movie. No way. 
 You got a better idea? 
 No! 
 No! 
 [ Hissing ] 
 [ both coughing ] 
 You want to die?! Try that again! 
 Let's finish it. 
 Let's finish it! 
 It's finished. 
 You win. 
 [ Laughs, grunts ] 
 Do I want to die? That's rich. 
 Mason, you honestly think... we're getting out of here any other way? 
 Huh? 
 [ Gasps, groans ] 
 Pope: What? 
 It's my ankle. 
 [ Groaning ] 
 Let's get dry. 
 How you doing, Jeannie? 
 I don't know. 
 What's wrong? 
 Just wondering if this is how it all ends. 
 How  what  ends? 
 They can't kill us. They can't dominate us. 
 So they just turn us into them? 
 Create a new species, half-human, half-alien? 
 I don't know. 
 Dad, you have to promise me something. 
 You know if I can, I will. 
 Don't let them get me, okay? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You know. 
 Please. 
 I don't want them to use me for -ust promise me, no matter what, you won't. 
 Never, ever. 
 I promise. 
 [ Thunder rumbles ] 
 Dismount. 
 Let's spread out. See what we can see. 
 Hey. You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. Why? 
 You've just been acting weird this whole time. That's all. 
 Look, it's just this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 
 I mean, look. Anne, the baby, they could be anywhere. 
 If Anne doesn't want to be found, she's smart enough she's not gonna be found. 
 We have to try, right? 
 I guess so, yeah. 
 Ben: Skitter tracks. 
 Some human prints, too. Can't tell how many. 
 They've got her. 
 We can't be sure, son. 
 Rebel Skitters, they have spies in the Espheni system. 
 If anyone can find Anne and Lexie, it's them. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 If they're still alive. 
 Listen. Anne and your baby sister are most certainly alive. 
 All right? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 How can you be sure? 
 Because if they weren't, we would have found them. 
 Now, we don't give up hope ever. 
 You  don't. And that's an order. 
 Yes, sir. 
 When we get back, we'll talk to your Skitter friends. 
 And we're gonna launch those rebel spies. 
 Let's mount up and head home. 
 [ Bird squawks ] 
 Give me the belt. 
 There had to have been a tracking device on the airplane. 
 That's the only explanation. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 That's how they knew we were at Keystone. 
 Look, you got to let that go, Mason. 
 It doesn't matter anymore. 
 It's gonna get tight. 
 [ Groans ] 
 We got to get moving. 
 Let's go. Get some weight on it. 
 Come on. Got it? 
 [ Screams ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Damn it, Mason. We don't have a choice. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Look, Mason, we got to go. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 You hear me? We're gonna die out here. 
 We got to go, and we got to go now. 
 Go. 
 No, no. Come on. 
 I'm not leaving without you. That's not gonna happen. 
 One more time. Come on. Let's go. Let's do it. 
 Just go. You got what you wanted. 
 You get to walk out of the woods. 
 It's not gonna work that way. 
 You are gonna get off your ass, get dressed, and we are going to move. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You owe me an airplane. That's it. 
 That is the only reason that I am hauling your ass out of here. 
 You understand that? 
 What are you gonna do with an airplane? 
 You got motorcycles. You got Humvees. 
 You can leave Charleston anytime you want. 
 Why don't you go? 
 If I did all that, I think I'd miss out on all the fun and adventure. 
 Oh, man, it must be nice to be John Pope, to live life with no responsibility, no accountability, no sense of obligation, no sense of duty, no sense of honor, and no sense of remorse! 
 That must be nice! 
 Shut up. 
 You're a fake! You're a phony! 
 You are a coward. 
 I'm gonna die out here. 
 You're gonna die out here because you don't have the balls to walk out of here without me! 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Thunder rumbles ] 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 I don't like that look. 
 It doesn't add up. 
 What doesn't add up? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Let's say you had a toaster that you wanted me to power up for you. 
 Most household appliances use between 300 and 900 watts. 
 So that's what I'd provide. That's all I'd provide. 
 I wouldn't go to the trouble of creating a system that gives, say, 25,000 watts, which would be enough to run an electric furnace, because that would be... overkill. 
 So, what about this device is overkill? 
 This  thing  right here is connected, like some kind of massive accumulator. 
 It's, uh...like an energy-storage device. 
 And if this weapon uses plasma armature... and I think it does, then... 
 It would  never  need that much power, not even by a long shot. 
 It would be... 
 It would be overkill. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Exactly. 
 So, maybe it's not what we think it is? 
 Or what the Volm are telling us it is. 
 What are the Volm telling us it is? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't  know? 
 Tom Mason didn't ask you to look into this, did he? 
 No, he didn't. 
 And he should have. 
 He should have told us all. 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 I assume you won't tell anyone about this. 
 I think that would be for the best. 
 I do have the DNA results back, by the way, if you're interested. 
 Results? 
 The DNA results from the newborns. 
 And? 
 They're all negative, except the Glass child. 
 That's good. 
 Yes. It is, I think. 
 I think it's  very  good. 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 [ Thunder rumbles ] 
 Ahh. 
 Dad. Dad, you got to get up. 
 How did you find me? 
 They're here. We got to go. 
 Who's here? 
 We don't have much time. We have to get up. 
 Where's Anne? Where's Lexie? 
 They need your help. You got to get up right now! Come on, Dad! 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Chittering ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Screeching ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 One of you doesn't go home tonight. 
 Is it you? Or you? 
 [ Hisses ] 
 [ Gunshots ] 
 There's only one thing on this planet I can't stand more than you, Mason. 
 [ Shotgun cocks ] 
 That's Skitters. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Grunting ] 
 Almost there. 
 It ain't a Harley, but it'll do. 
 There's also enough... gas in this thing. 
 It should get us most of the way home. 
 The folks that owned this tub weren't much on... fine dining... 
 But, uh...they keep a good supply of 12 gauge. 
 Oh, here. 
 The shocks on this buggy are crap. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Metal clinking ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 That's for mom. 
 We never talk about her anymore. 
 You notice that? 
 Yeah. 
 How come? 
 I don't know. 
 Hey. What's wrong? 
 I don't want to be alone, Ben. 
 Like that lady. 
 I don't want it. 
 I don't want to be -ie facedown, buried by some strangers. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Engine revs ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Hold it! Stay where you are! 
 Don't come any further! 
 Tom: Don't shoot! 
 It's Tom Mason. 
 We're coming in. It's the President. 
 It's President Mason! 
 What happened, sir? 
 We ran out of gas. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations in distance ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Inhales sharply ] 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 How long have I been out? 
 Two days. 
 How long have you been sitting in here? 
 Two days. 
 I lived. 
 I'm sorry to disappoint you. 
 Yeah, look, I just think we should get our stories straight. 
 What story would that be? 
 You saved my ass. I saved yours. 
 I'd say that makes us even. 
 Well, you know what they say about a tie. 
 It's like kissing your sister. 
 [ Chuckling ] Hey. 
 Now, there's a sight for sore eyes. 
 I'm happy to be seen. 
 Pope's filled me in on what happened. 
 General Bressler -- 
 I hear that his flying saved your lives. 
 It's true. 
 Any word from Cochise or the President? 
 Radio silence. 
 I assume you've contacted the Volm. 
 They're out looking for him. 
 Hey. Welcome back. 
 I got a little headache, Doc. 
 Aside from that, I feel fine. 
 If it's all the same to you, gentlemen, I got a business to run. 
 Hey, Pope. 
 Next basket wins. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Oh, like I survived a plane crash. 
 When can I get out of here? 
 Um, not for a couple days, at least. 
 You were pretty dehydrated, and it's gonna be a few days before you can put any weight on that ankle. 
 Dad! 
 [ Chuckling ] Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Good to see you again, Dad. 
 I'm glad you made it. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Yeah, I'm glad I made it, too. 
 [ Grunts, inhales deeply ] 
 Where's Anne? Where's Alexis? 
 Dan, where's Anne? 
 There's no easy way to say this, Tom, so I'm just going to say it. 
 Anne and Alexis are missing -- gone.
