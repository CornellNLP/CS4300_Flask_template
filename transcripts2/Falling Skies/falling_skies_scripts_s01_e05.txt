 [ Engines revving ] 
 Thought you were gonna leave me in the dust back there on that turn. 
 I paid attention when Pope taught me how to ride. 
 Figured I'd have to outrun him some day. 
 What do you got? 
 Well, we're clear on the 111 all the way to the turnpike. 
 And there's a, uh, a water tower at the corner of Hosmer we haven't tapped yet. Okay. 
 All right? All right. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 So, are you ever gonna tell me how you knew where all these drugs were? 
 What were you, a junior in high school? 
 Senior. 
 And you didn't know where the local dealer kept his stash? 
 What'd you do in your free time? 
 I played lacrosse. 
 That explains a lot. 
 Yeah, we... 
 Percocet and, uh, Demerol... 
 Oxycontin. 
 And Heroin. 
 I don't think I've ever even seen Heroin before. 
 Looks a lot like Cocaine. 
 You learn the difference when you watch a lot of late-night cop shows, which is what I used to do when I couldn't sleep. Huh. 
 I once had a student give a thesis on the history of the American police drama. 
 I graded him down 'cause he didn't mention "Miami Vice. " 
 Really? This is amazing. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, Margaret! 
 Margaret: Yeah. 
 We need to work these into a usable form. 
 Is this all gonna be ready by tomorrow night? 
 Look, Tom, harness removal is not my area of expertise. 
 You should talk to Harris. 
 He's the one that figured out this operation. 
 I just want you to understand how risky this is. 
 It worked on Rick. 
 It seems to, but we're not sure yet. 
 I just... 
 If something was to happen to Ben... 
 You want me to know that Ben could die. 
 Okay. I know. 
 Look, you're worried, I'm worried. 
 Everybody's got to do their best. 
 I realize you can't perform miracles. 
 You know, the other day, I put a picture of him up on that bulletin board. 
 All those kids are missing... 
 But Ben... 
 I know right where he is. 
 I'm gonna go get him. 
 And then we'll take it from there. 
 We just got the report from the recon team. 
 The other group of harnessed kids didn't come back last night. 
 Ben's group is still there, but we don't know for how long. 
 Drugs are ready. We want to move. 
 Show me what you got. 
 Okay. 
 It's a mech here. 
 We rip out this window, eight go in. 
 We assume that the noise wakes up the skitters and draws the mech. 
 The mech comes around. It gets blown up right here. 
 Inside, we've got two men on this door facing the hallway... continuous fire once the skitters show up. 
 That leaves six men in the room to kill the skitters. 
 Hard to time that. 
 Grab the kids, get them back out that window, and we disappear into the woods. 
 Tom, in battle, the more important the objective, the easier it is to overlook flaws in the plan. 
 Now, if the skitters break through into the room or circle around outside to intercept you, you fail. 
 I can accept that risk. It's not just your risk. 
 It's the team's risk, and it's Ben's risk. 
 What happens to him if the two of you get yourselves killed? 
 Now, with your plan, the first thing that you do is you wake the skitters up. 
 There goes your tactical advantage. 
 You want to keep them asleep as long as possible. 
 Hmm. 
 What if, um... 
 What if we keep them asleep the whole time? 
 'Cause, like, there's just that one mech there during the day. 
 So we send the recon team in. 
 They break the lock on the back door. 
 Then tonight they come in, and just one guy goes in alone. 
 You know, he goes in, goes to Ben's room, kills the skitter while it's asleep. 
 Well, they're not that easy to kill, Hal. 
 Well, you did it. Almost. 
 Getting in and out quietly is your best bet. 
 Probably your only bet. 
 Figure it out. 
 [ Growls softly ] 
 How much water you gonna give that damn thing? 
 Enough to keep it hydrated. 
 It's not like it would be hydrating you if you were its prisoner. 
 I don't remember Rick being dehydrated when we got him. 
 Ah, that's true. 
 But he did have 12 metallic spikes bored into his spine and brain function at the level of a moderately sophisticated tomato. 
 [ Snarls ] 
 [ Bell ringing ] 
 Ooh. Lunchtime. 
 Why don't you get it a nosh? 
 I just don't think we should be keeping a skitter here. 
 Margaret: Yeah, it's better in a cage than out scooping up kids. 
 Better off dead if you ask me. 
 Don't get your blood pressure up. It's not good for the baby. 
 What's not good for my baby is sharing my home with a killer alien from outer space. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Thanks. 
 Haven't laughed in a while. 
 Yeah, well, I wasn't joking. 
 It's still funny. 
 Hey. 
 I'm Margaret. 
 Sarah. 
 ♪ Many rivers to cross ♪ 
 Tom: That's an interesting choice. 
 It's a limited selection but eclectic. 
 Tell me you got something for me. 
 Okay, well, skitters communicate using radio waves... that much is clear. 
 If they're transmitting, I can usually pick it up on the radio if they're nearby. 
 But a single skitter walking down a hallway probably isn't transmitting. 
 They're just off in their little skitter head. 
 That's too bad. I was hoping we could use it like an early-warning detection system. 
 I know. There's got to be some use for it. 
 You see, these components are from the 1940s, and, I mean, what you're talking about, we're just not there yet. 
 Well, if there are sentries, maybe you should wait and get Ben later. 
 No. No, no, no. We can't wait any longer. 
 Got to trust your instincts, Tom. 
 A lot more reliable than technology. 
 Oh, well, keep your best man on it. 
 ♪ Well, I guess I'll have to cry ♪ 
 ♪ many rivers to cross ♪ 
 ♪ rivers to cross ♪ 
 ♪ but just where to begin? ♪ 
 ♪ I'm playing for time ♪ 
 ♪ there have been times I find myself ♪ 
 ♪ thinking of committing... ♪ Ooh, captain Weaver. What can I do for you? ♪ Yes, I've got man... ♪ Are you saying we can't play music? You can play whatever you want. Just not this. You guys belong at medieval times. We're going to get Ben. Got to kill a skitter without making any noise. These things only give you one shot. Let's keep at it. You got any pointers? Mm-hmm. Margaret: All right. You feel that? Mm-hmm. Okay. There. And it's a slow, steady pull on the trigger, and the kick comes from the front. Here's another idea... make sure you're close. Ben's at the hospital, right? Franklin Pierce Memorial off route 2? Yeah. Yeah, I know that place. My aunt was there for a long time, so I used to visit her. Are you going through the rear door? Through the ambulance bay. No, you want to go through the E.R. and then turn left. It'll take you to the main corridor. Tom: Can you show me on this map? [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Children laughing ] Whoop. You better hurry. Soup's going fast. Yeah, not fast enough. I, uh, wanted to talk to you, sweetheart. Uh-oh. It's a "sweetheart" talk? [ Screeches ] [ Cage rattles ] [ Squeals ] That's a new sound. [ Hisses ] Change your mind? Ready for Dr. Glass' chat? Rapid blinking. [ Growls ] [ Screeches ] You remember that time in Lake Huntington when Sam was in the boat, I caught the fish, but as soon as I pulled the hook out of its mouth, I- it swam away, and... Uncle Scott, just stop. Kate and I spent a long time looking at that bulletin board the other day. And tomorrow we are going to put up something for Sam... I'm thinking maybe something from that weekend. Maybe draw that fish. We want you to come with us. No. Okay. Okay. Fine. No, I understand. You can't go on like this forever. I can. [ Skitter screeches ] Harris: No! No! Aah! [ Skitter snarling ] Aah! Aah! Get a guard! We need to shoot it! Aah! [ Electricity crackles ] [ Skitter screeching ] [ Skitter growls ] He's dead. [ Cage rattles ] [ Skitter snarls ] [ Grunts ] [ Growls ] Get a runner out to Porter. He won't be happy. We need to form a burial detail. And we need to kill it... now. Porter wouldn't want that. Dr. Glass... When the civilians find out about this, they are going to panic, and in this case, I cannot blame them. We never should have had this thing here in the first place! We have it here for a reason, and that reason is still valid. Studying them is our best chance at figuring out how to stop them. And I was making progress. [ Scoffs ] I'll tell you what... I will give you 24 hours to learn whatever there is left to learn from that thing, and then I am coming to kill it myself. [ Skitter growls softly ] [ Indistinct conversations ] How you feeling? You're Hal. Yeah. You're not gonna eat that? I'm not hungry. That's a little uncommon around here. [ Chuckles ] So, uh... What's it like... being with them? [ Dish thuds ] Are you, like, with them all the time? We stayed together. All right. What if you had to take a piss or something in the middle of the night? You went. Okay. What about those harnesses? You know, they ever, um... Like, break or anything? You know, I mean, like... Is that how they knew that you were one of them? Is it because of the harness? They're not like that. You know, my brother is in that hospital. That's where you were, right? Now, do they have any sentries in the hall... You're going to try and get him, aren't you? Yeah. They'll kill you all. Margaret, hey. I wanted to ask you. We're having a baby shower for Sarah tomorrow night, and... Did you get in a fight or something? Oh, no, I had to clean out and re-stitch an infected wound this morning. You a doctor? I was in med school. But I'm inviting you to the baby shower tonight. For Sarah. Yeah. I just met her. I'll pass. I think Sarah would really like it if you came. Yeah, well... I'm a little busy with this whole war thing, but... you're leaking. You know, it wasn't easy for me at first, either... settling into a new community. A community, huh? That's a pretty fancy name for a bunch of old people and teachers with guns. I know that your last place wasn't one. How did you end up with those creeps? You don't want to know, sweetheart. I'm sorry about Harris. He didn't deserve to die. [ Sighs ] Nobody did. You'll be fine without him. I hope so, Tom. Well, hope's got nothing to do with it. You were the one I always wanted to operate on Ben. Harris was a great surgeon. You care. Surgeons would not consider that a plus. Patients do. Your son's not up there, is he? No. Well, maybe... I mean, I realize it's not the same... Ben's still with us... but maybe you should put something up there. Why? It's just... How we are. [ Sighs ] [ Footsteps depart ] Hal: Between it being nighttime and them being asleep, I may be able to go right in. What's going on? Hal's come up with an alternative plan. Really? I'm going in... with Rick's harness strapped to my back. I'm gonna pretend to be one of them. Absolutely not. It's original. It's crazy. I don't know what's crazy anymore. We're fighting aliens from outer space. We got an army half-full of kids. Give us a minute. Look, dad, I talked to Rick. He says the kids wander around in there by themselves. You're saying that they can't tell whether the harness is connected or not? I don't think so, not unless they're trying to communicate with you. This is good. This is great. But you're... Look, don't! Dad! Listen to me! If we had more time, maybe we could come up with the perfect plan. But we have to get Ben now. Yes... when you're young, you feel like you're invincible... Oh, my God. And you don't always use the best... You gonna give me a lecture on drunk driving right now? No, I'm trying to explain to you that you don't understand how easily you can die. Are you kidding me? 'Cause every last person who's still alive on this planet realizes how easily they can die. Well, I'm not gonna let it be you. I'm not saying this is gonna work. I'm saying it might work. But if you go in there instead of me, it will not work, okay? We got to take risks as a family, okay? You going in there is no different than me going in there. Me going in there is no different than you going in there. It's all about who has the best chance of coming out. And that's me. Making yourself invisible to the enemy is a basic tactic, Tom. I think it's your best shot. But it's your call. We still don't know how to kill one of these things without making any noise, so until we figure that out, I don't have to make a call. Without making any noise? Hal: Yeah. Do you think it's gonna be sleeping in some soundproof chamber with its head in a guillotine? [ Chuckles ] Probably not. There is one thing. Mike hit him... it... in its mouth the other day. It seemed to knock it unconscious. We know that there's a soft palate. And the nerve center is in there, we know it's connected to the base of the brain stem. That means, theoretically... Can you open that? 
 
 [ Skitter snarling, screeching ] Anne. I'm not gonna let Hal risk his life on a theory. Anne, don't! [ Grunts ] [ Screeching ] [ Grunts ] [ Thud ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Scalpel clatters ] Okay. That worked. We had to know how to do it. You. Hal. Me. All of us... the human race. I know. And don't think it was hard for me... because it wasn't. All I had to do was think about my family. I just pictured them for one second, and that's all it took. You and Kate and Scott... you guys all want me to have a picture up here, but I didn't want to tell you... I don't have anything. I don't have one single photograph. I don't have a truck. I don't... I don't have a Boris bear. I don't... [ gasping ] All I have is this. [ Thudding ] [ Thudding continues ] Okay. Tell me. Left at the first corridor, lobby, left at second corridor, right. The next corridor is Ben's, the South corridor. Third door on the right. Reference? Moon falling in the east-southeast. All right, Weaver told you that the slower you go, the less noise you're gonna make, right? Yeah. I got it. All right. What's the distress signal? I yell "help" as loud as I can. [ Laughing ] Don't do that. Don't joke. One flash out the window. What's the "ready" signal? Three flashes. All right, turn around. Let me see that thing. You know, ever since you were a little kid, you could... you could do anything with your body, with your hands. You threw a perfect football when you were 2. It's called a spiral, dad. Yeah. And you can be stubborn. Sometimes that's a good thing. Anything you wanted to get done, you got done. And if anybody can do this, it's you. All right, 15 minutes. Give me that signal, or I come in after you. Well, you give me 10, and you'll be looking for me. Hey. Come here. See you in a few. [ Thudding ] [ Skitter grunts ] [ Hinges creak ] No skitters in sight. So far, so good. It doesn't feel like that. [ Skitter hisses ] [ Skitter whimpers ] [ Skitter whimpers ] [ Skitter whimpers ] It's been 20 minutes. How long should it take him to get to Ben's room? Not this long. All right. I'm gonna go check on him. [ Thudding ] Tom! We need to wait for the signal! Come on. You got a plan, boss? If I can get to Ben's room, I might be able to find another entrance. [ Thudding, whirring ] No, no, no, no, no, no. Go, go, go, go, go! Okay. I know another way. Show me. You guys stay here, wait for the signal. Okay. [ Skitter snorts ] Ben. [ Grunts, screeches ] [ Skitter screeching ] [ Skitter wheezes ] You okay? I got him. Okay. Ben. Ben. Ben, I'm taking you home. We're taking all of them. We got to go. [ Grunting ] Put each kid on a stretcher along the wall. Woman: We need more gauze! Monitor all their vitals, let me know of any changes. We're doing the surgeries one after the other. All right. Tom: Don't worry, Ben. I got you. Anne: I need 10cc of morphine, stat. Woman: Hand me another blanket. You might not want to be here. No, this is exactly where I want to be. Let's just get this thing off of him. Woman: Careful! Careful! Anne: Blood pressure? 110/70. Man: More gauze! Tom: I got this. Let's get the IV's in all the other patients. Woman: Make sure those needles are sterile! Man: Okay. Let's go! Let's go! Something's happening. His pressure's dropping. This one's pulse is dropping, too! Tom: Hang on, Ben. [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Grunts ] Ben, hang in there. It's dad. Pulse is picking back up. All right, let's get him down. Let's get her up. What's happening? This one's pulse is faint. Anne: All right, let's speed up the prep. Let's get everyone ready. Tom, I need you to cut off his shirt. This one's having trouble breathing! They're going into withdrawal! All right, lift the harness. Let's get this done. BP's 90/50. Hold her steady. [ Gasping ] Man: No pulse! Somebody give me a hand! We need to get him to the table! This is the last patient! [ Ball thuds ] [ Hissing ] [ Grunting ] Turn him over. Watch his head. One, two, three, four, five... Eight, nine. [ Grunting softly ] I'm not getting a pulse. I don't have a pulse. [ Grunting continues ] He's gone, Anne. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. [ Breathing heavily ] I don't know what went wrong. Tom: Anne. You saved five. I lost one. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Door opens ] You should get that hand looked at. They've been a little busy in there. Hey, um... Thanks for what you did back there. It was all your dad. Yeah, he said that you knew a different way into the hospital. Through the nurses locker room. I used to hang out with them during their cigarette breaks. So when you were visiting your aunt at the hospital, you were hanging out with the nurses? Something like that. Friends with all the drug dealers in town, all the nurses in the hospital... you must have been one popular girl. [ Chuckles ] I had cancer when I was 16. So... Um... [ Chuckles ] One of the doctors told me to smoke pot to... you know, for the nausea, whatever. And, um, so I'd go to this guy's house, and... He would, like, show off for me, I guess. I don't know why. I wasn't looking so good in those days, with the whole no hair from the chemo and everything. What kind of cancer? It was bad. Had a 50/50 chance. Those odds make you think differently. I'm glad you made it. [ Chuckles ] Dad, guard told me Ben pulled through. How is he? He's still unconscious. Probably until sometime tomorrow. We got him back. You did. [ Sighs ] You got him back. You were incredibly brave tonight. And I'm so proud of you. [ Chuckles ] I know, dad. You don't know. That's okay. You don't know. [ Inhales deeply ] You don't know what it's like to be a father... And to see your son grow into a man. He's still your kid, but... A man, like you... And in so many ways... Better than you. I'm not. Hey, it's what we want. We want you to be better. [ Door opens ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Oh, my God. It's beautiful. Every bead represents a wish or a good thought... Or a piece of advice... So that when you go into labor and you put this bracelet on, you'll have all of us right there with you. And you have to remember, with this child, it's yours... And it's not yours. As soon as it's born, you have to start setting it free. I hope that your child is courageous and strong and lucky. And I hope that they will face life, the good and the bad... All of it. Somebody's up tonight. Take a listen. The heartbeat's really fast. Is that normal? [ Chuckles ] It's supposed to be that fast. Your baby sounds just fine. Come here.
