 Previously on "Eye Candy"... 
 A serial killer party? 
 It's a celebration for the people of New York. 
 If you wanted to kill me, I'd be dead already. 
 That's my girl. 
 They're hiding something from you, Lindy. 
 Do you know anything about my sister? 
 You're not afraid. You should be. 
 You all should be. 
 I promise you won't feel a thing. 
 But I'll be awake the whole time? 
 I know it seems crazy but the brain doesn't have any pain receptors, so you won't feel any pain. 
 I swear. 
 That's supposed to make me feel better? 
 Dr. Wells has done this like a hundred times. 
 (Machine beeping) 
 (Laughing) 
 You're doing great. 
 I found the focal point of your seizures and I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. 
 Okay. 
 What color is that? 
 Yellow. 
 Try again. Now what color is it? 
 Red. It's red. 
 There we go. And can you tell me what this is? 
 (Machine beeping) 
 Will you check that, please? 
 (Beeping continues) 
 Is she okay? She okay? 
 You are doing... you're doing grea... 
 What's happening? Help! 
 Help! Help me! 
 Help! Help! 
 S01E06 
"ICU" 
 Oh, God, that's inedible. Look, I... 
 I really have no idea what I'm doing right now. 
 Yeah, he thinks we're going a restaurant, but he cooked for me, so it was like a challenge. Jake is almost here there is no turning back, Sophia. 
 At least after this is over, I'll never have to do it again, if he lives to tell the tale. 
 (Doorbell ringing) 
 Oh, God, he's here. 
 I gotta go.

 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, why? 
 'Cause I haven't heard from you in a week. 
 I needed a break. 
 Last week was kind of a tough week. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it was. 
 Your face looks better. 
 Can I come in? 
 Uh, sure, but it's got to be quick. 
 I got a thing. 
 A thing? 
 What kind of thing. 
 A thing. 
 Oh. 
 That kind of thing. 
 What's his name? 
 Is he late? He's late, isn't he? 
 No. And it's none of your business. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I need a favor. 
 A favor? 
 Yeah. 
 Really, what kind of favor? 
 What... hey, that is not for you. 
 You forgot the basil. 
 Oh, God! 
 I did, didn't I? 
 Yep. 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 Hang on a sec. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, no, that sucks. 
 No, seriously, it's okay. Really, don't worry about it. 
 I'll... I'll cancel the reservation. 
 Sure. I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
 Jake Bolin stood you up, huh? 
 Looks that way. 
 What's going on with him? 
 Just tell me what you want, Tommy. 
 An old friend of mine is in trouble. 
 Need a little help, off the books. 
 Off the books? What exactly do you mean? 
 This friend's a neurosurgeon at Manhattan east memorial hospital. Last week, Dr. Wells was in the middle of awake neurosurgery on a 16-year-old kid when the whole operating team passed out. 
 Had the kid's brains literally in their hands. 
 That's not good. 
 Kid suffered severed hemorrhaging. 
 Hospital says it's human error. 
 The anesthesiologist messed up. Seems the nitrous oxide regulator leaked gas into the or, put everyone to sleep. 
 But? 
 Machines all over the hospital have been shutting down and rebooting for weeks for no reason, everything from ventilators to bypass machines. 
 Let me guess. This nitrous oxide regulator is wireless and fully automated. 
 Yep. 
 In other words... hackable. 
 Exactly. 
 The hospital's like the most vulnerable place on the planet. 
 Any kid with a mediocre setup and half a brain could hack in. 
 You think someone's trying to sabotage the equipment? 
 Did anyone die? 
 Not yet. 
 IT is denying there's a problem. Seems they just spent five million on a new state-of-the-art network they claim is impenetrable. 
 You know nothing's impenetrable. 
 Yup. Looks like this is a closed network with no remote connectivity. 
 It's got to be someone on the inside. 
 I know somebody's covering something up. 
 And, look, I don't want to go in guns blazing with a warrant and alert whoever is doing this. 
 We need to keep this quiet for now until we have something more concrete to go on. 
 So you want me to go in and find out what's going on? 
 Yes. 
 And what's in it for me? 
 Thought it'd be fun. 
 All you gotta do is get in the server room. 
 Once we perform a correlative log analysis, we'll know if this is just operational error or if someone really is messing with the hospital. 
 I've done much worse. 
 I know. 
 That her? That's Dr. Wells? 
 Yep. 
 She's hot. 
 Yep. 
 So you and her were... 
 For a summer. 
 A neurosurgeon and a cop. How did that work out? 
 It didn't. 
 This isn't gonna be a problem, is it? 
 'Cause it really seems like a whole conflict-of-interest thing. 
 I haven't got much time. 
 This is Lindy Samson. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Who is she? 
 We work together. 
 I borrowed this from the IT department. 
 It'll get you into the server room. 
 I need it back in about an hour or so. 
 Okay, then. Be right back. 
 I'm putting my job on the line here. 
 This better work. 
 Is she good? Better than you? 
 Some of the time. 
 Dr. Vinet, please report to OR four. 
 Dr. Vinet, OR four. 
 (Lock beeping) 
 (Lock beeping) 
 (Computer beeping) 
 (Cell phone beeping) 
 Uh, this is weird. I found a rogue wireless access point on the fourth floor. It could be a window. 
 The fourth floor is the ICU. 
 There's an unusual port open. 
 It's moving a lot of traffic. This could be what the hacker is using. 
 I pinpointed the rogue WIP's Mac address. 
 Hooking into WiFi now. 
 Okay, you got us what we need. 
 Come back and we'll discuss the next steps. 
 (Cell phone beeping) 
 I've got a better idea. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 (Cell phone beeping) 
 George, I need your help. 
 What's taking her so long? 
 What carpet cleaning van has an omnidirectional antenna on it? 
 So you definitely have a fever and you have an elevated heart rate. We're gonna see what your blood work tells us. 
 (Beeping) 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 George, she's entering my blood into the system now. 
 You know hospitals are giant petri dishes, right? 
 Last year, 75,000 people checked into hospitals for routine procedures and ended up dying from staph infections, food poisoning, ebola. 
 George, shut up. 
 Okay. 
 Did you get access? 
 Your MiFi is purring like a kitten. Hold on. 
 Boom, I'm in. Okay, so how sick do you want to be? 
 Sick enough to get me into the ICU. 
 I gotta go check on something, I'll meet you back at the hospital. 
 Yeager, I need you down at Manhattan East Memorial Hospital. 
 Got a problem. 
 What'd you give me? 
 Hold on. 
 Just a little case of neurosyphilis. 
 Neurosyphilis? 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry, I panicked. But it says here it's a big enough deal to get you admitted into the ICU. 
 I hate you. 
 You're gonna hate me even more, 'cause it's kind of a big deal. 
 You should have a seizure, faint or something... ha. 
 (Glass shattering) 
 I'll be right back. 
 Hi. 
 They just leave you here? 
 Yeah. 
 They do that. 
 They forget that we're people with places to go. 
 I'm not actually going anywhere attached to all this, but... 
 You're new. I'm Erika. 
 Lindy. 
 What are you in for? 
 Um, I'm not sure. Neuro... something. 
 I can't even pronounce it. 
 You? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
 I can pronounce it really well. I've had a ton of practice. 
 Okay, Erika, CT is ready for you. 
 This is about as exciting as it gets. 
 First take these. 
 They feed me like 20 of these a day so my liver won't explode. 
 I thought it was your heart. 
 Well, when you're half-machine, body parts tend to rebel. 
 Complications. 
 Come on, sweetie, let's not talk like that. 
 Let's go. 
 Like ships in the night. 
 Open up, NYPD. 
 Oh. You. 
 Yes, me. 
 Great. 
 What exactly have we got here? 
 Nothing. Pizza? 
 Looks like a lot more than nothing to me. 
 Does it? I don't know. 
 You're wirelessly routed directly to the command server at the hospital. Not exactly legal. 
 Well, you know, that depends on your definition of "legal." 
 The opposite of "illegal." 
 Ah, yes, that would make sense. 
 Where's Lindy? 
 Lindy, I don't know... who that, who that? 
 Who, who that? I don't know, I don't know. 
 You want me to impound this van? 
 Do whatever you want. 
 Listen, George. If something happens to Lindy, it's gonna be on you. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Lindy checked herself into the ICU to get closer to the rogue access point, but it's no big deal. 
 It's no biggie. 
 Here we go again. 
 All right. You watch Lindy, Yeager watches you. 
 What? 
 You heard me. 
 Do you ever smile? 
 Uh, neurosyphilis occurs in people who have had a chronic or untreated infection for about ten to 20 years. 
 And, in your case, that would make you like an infant when you contracted the bacteria. Now, we'll need to run some more tests. 
 (Beeping) 
 (Beeping) 
 Would you just listen to sense for once in your life? 
 Well, I won't accept that. Where are you going? 
 To get some air. 
 
 
 
 Hey. Lindy. 
 Everything okay? 
 That's Mark. He has a flair for the dramatic. 
 He's British. 
 I hate flowers. They die so quick. 
 Cactuses are hard to kill. 
 Say hello to big vad. 
 Hooked me up to this ticker four days ago. 
 It's the only thing keeping me alive. 
 It's freaky, huh? 
 It's tough. 
 You never really appreciate how vulnerable you are until something like this hits you. 
 How could you? 
 What's going on with you? You're carrying something heavy. 
 What? 
 When you dance as close to death as I have, you see things clearly. 
 And you certainly don't have time to be tactful. 
 I lost someone recently. 
 A boy someone. 
 Yeah. Not sure what Mark's gonna do when I go. 
 I think I might be his best friend. 
 He'll survive. 
 He will. 
 Careful in here. 
 It's all a big machine. 
 Money is the only thing they really care about. 
 I gotta sleep. 
 Hey, keep up the fight. 
 Sure. 
 (Beeping) 
 (Beeping continues) 
 You an organ donor? 'Cause I heard there's these doctors who let people die just so they can harvest their organs for big moolah, dinero, cha-ching. 
 How do you sleep at night? 
 On my back. 
 Well, sometimes if it's cold, in the fetal position. 
 And I get real... You don't care. 
 Yes, she found it. Logs are coming in. 
 What are you doing? 
 Meditating. 
 Well, you really shouldn't be walking around. We've got to get you ready for more tests. 
 Okay. 
 I need to extract some of your cerebral spinal fluid. 
 I'll be inserting this needle into the base of your spine. 
 Okay, really, I'm fine. No, seriously, I feel so much better now. 
 Big exhale on the count of three. 
 One. 
 Two. 
 Three. 
 Sweetheart. 
 You didn't call and tell me you were sick. 
 That you were in the ICU. I didn't want to bother you, honey. You've got a lot on your plate. 
 Yeah, who are you? 
 Her fiance. 
 We need to communicate better, darling. 
 It can be very disturbing when you do things on your own. 
 But we agreed, you can't control me, I don't work for you. (Chuckling) 
 You know what? Go ahead. 
 Test away. 
 Then give her a hug. 
 It'll alleviate the pressure on her spine. 
 Now, sit up, lean forward, arms around his neck. 
 I am going to kill you. 
 Okay. You'll feel a small pinch. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this test really necessary? 
 Sir, your fiance is very sick. 
 I presume the two of you are intimate? 
 Because you're gonna have to get tested, too. 
 Tommy? 
 What are you doing here? What's going on? 
 The, uh... Doctor here thinks my fiance... 
 Fiance, really? 
 Why is your fiance getting a lumbar puncture? 
 Uh, neurosyphilis. 
 Wow. 
 She certainly does get around, doesn't she? 
 Yes. Yes, she does. 
 Murphy, I'll take care of this. 
 Friends of the family. 
 Fine. 
 Could you just... Thanks. 
 Could I talk to you outside, please? 
 I came to you because I thought this could be discreet. 
 I could lose my job if they find out I snuck your fiance into the server room. What is going on? 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 Hey. I've analyzed the logs from the RAP. A singular IP address from a hospital-issued tablet logged on at the time of the last attack. The tablet was assigned to a nurse, Lawrence Kennedy. 
 Work. 
 When did the last intrusion occur? 
 Five days ago. Why are you whispering? 
 Lindy? 
 Linds? (Alarm blaring) 
 She's displaying no sign. Check her ITS. 
 She's cyanotic. 
 What are you doing? Get out of the way. 
 There's a malfunction here, doctor. 
 Vad's not operational. 
 What the hell do you mean? 
 Total shutdown. 
 Talk to me. 
 BP is 84 over 58 and it's falling. 
 Defib. 
 I don't have a pulse. 
 Everyone clear. 
 Clear.

 There was a complete shutdown of her artificial heart. 
 It looks that way. 
 I was just talking to her less than an hour ago. 
 Look, whoever's doing this just committed the first murder. 
 (Machine beeping) 
 This whole floor has people hooked up to machines. All of them could die if we don't find out what's going on. 
 I need to question the nurse whose tablet was used. 
 Wait? If it's him, he could trigger another event. 
 Well, that's a risk we'll have to take. 
 George, I need you to check nurse Kennedy's social media. 
 I was wondering if I could have a word. 
 Sweetheart. I changed my mind. 
 Kennedy was at riotfest in Chicago last week when the hacker last checked in. 
 So who else would have access to his tablet? 
 Anyone. 
 Everyone. 
 (Beeping) 
 (Beeping) 
 I'm sorry about Erika. 
 Thanks. I just met her earlier today but she seemed really strong. 
 Yeah, well, hooked up to a machine like that wasn't any way to live. 
 What am I supposed to do with this? 
 I can't throw it out and I can't keep it because every time I see it... Oh, God, I'm gonna have to clear out her apartment. 
 Does she have any family? 
 Some, but they were a mess. She was the one that got away. 
 Made a life. 
 And now she's dead. It's not fair. 
 For two years, Erika was on the Unos list for a new heart. 
 Worked her way to the top but got so sick, her doctors put her on a drug trial to bridge the time 'til an organ became available. 
 And one never did? 
 The meds destroyed Erika's liver... 
 Made her too weak for a donor heart, so she was bumped off the list. 
 She was basically waiting to die. 
 Erika was calm about all of it. 
 Almost too calm. 
 It was Mark who freaked out. 
 He was furious with the hospital. 
 Then we start with the boyfriend. 
 We always start with the boyfriend. 
 How long were you and Erika together? 
 I don't know if we were ever officially together. 
 We never had the talk. She wouldn't. 
 She said then I'd feel obliged to stick around. 
 She had no idea how mesmerizing her brilliant mind was. 
 How'd you meet? 
 We worked together. But we were good friends before that. 
 What kind of work? 
 Is this 20 questions? 
 Because I am really not in the mood to chitchat. 
 I'm sorry. 
 She actually wanted to die. 
 She decided. She accepted it. 
 (Beeping) 
 Paging Dr. Stayman, Dr. Stayman, please. 
 George, I need you to find out what kind of work Nexago Solutions does. 
 Hold on. 
 Erika and Mark design antivirus software. 
 (Machine beeping) 
 (Machines beeping rapidly) 
 (Alarm blaring) 
 Lindy, this isn't the work of a hacker. Something incredibly sophisticated is attacking the hospital's network. 
 So this could be a virus doing this? 
 (Beeping) 
 It's not just taking down one machine at a time anymore. 
 The virus tripped at the exact time Erika's death was entered into the system. And... it's propagating like a worm throughout the entire server farm. 
 That's not good. 
 This virus is bigger than anything we've ever dealt with, Lindy. 
 I think I know the person who could engineer such a sophisticated attack. 
 Who? 
 Mark. 
 We know you created a virus that destroyed Erika's heart machine. 
 To kill her? 
 No. 
 As a mercy death? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 What are you saying? 
 I didn't kill Erika. We designed the virus together, but... but it was never supposed to be used. 
 I probably would have helped her die if I'd had the courage. 
 Then who? Who else would do this? 
 She was never the victim. 
 She was the architect. 
 She killed herself, didn't she? 
 Yes. 
 We need to stop this. People could die. 
 The whole hospital is shutting down. 
 We designed the malware so that the only way to terminate its control is with a kill switch. 
 Where is it? 
 I don't know. 
 She would've hard-coded the firmware onto a tiny device. 
 That's how she operated. 
 That's what you were looking for in her room. 
 Yes. 
 She's been immobile for the past four days, so it has to be there, but I've searched everywhere. 
 We check the security footage. 
 You're saying all the earlier malfunctions, Erika was beta-testing the malware, making sure it worked? 
 That's some crazy lady. 
 She blamed the hospital, the doctors. 
 Well, how big is this kill switch? 
 Half-inch at most. 
 About the size of a dime. 
 There. On the table. 
 That's it. That's the kill switch. 
 Yep. 
 She swallowed it. 
 Uh-oh. 
 They're not really gonna do what I think they're gonna do. 
 Are they? 
 Yeah. 
 Gross. 
 We're here. 
 I know. It's a distinct smell. 
 You'll get used to it. 
 "So did my soul turn back to look again upon the past, which never had a living person left." 
 Dante's "inferno." 
 Yeager? 
 Check those. 
 Anything? 
 No. 
 I found her. 
 (Alarm blaring) 
 Dr. Wells! Where's Dr. Wells? 
 Okay, George, we're ready. 
 Okay, so make a simple incision. 
 What do you mean by simple? 
 Well, start at the throat and cut all the way through the groin. You'll have to clamp the distal esophagus so the contents of the stomachs don't spill out. See how they're doing it? 
 And then just remove her whole organ from her body. 
 Okay, okay. One step at a time. 
 (Exhaling) The throat to the groin, throat to the groin. 
 Yeah, you're gonna want to go around the navel because it's pretty tough. 
 Okay. 
 Would it help if I drew a line with a sharpie? 
 Guys, we need that kill switch. 
 We're running out of time. 
 Okay. 
 I can do this, I can do this, I can do this... 
 Let's do it together. 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing? 
 We need your help. 
 (Alarm blaring) 
 (Lock beeping) 
 That was supposed to work. 
 Think. What would Erika use as her authorization code? She liked creating things. 
 And this was about revenge. What was the name of the drug that destroyed Erika's liver? 
 I don't know. 
 What are you doing? 
 Moxopan. It's Moxopan. 
 (Buzzing) 
 It's not working. 
 (Cell phone chiming) 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 (Cell phone chiming) 
 (Cell phone chiming)

 Thank you, Tommy. 
 You know, I've been meaning to ask you, who's the lucky guy? 
 Oh, this? 
 Yeah. 
 My grandmother's. I wear it so patients don't hit on me. You wouldn't believe how many of them ask me out. 
 Popular girl. 
 Oh, please. Most of them are on death's door. What have they got to lose? 
 She your new partner? Since... Ben? 
 No, no, no. No, she's not my partner. 
 She's, uh... 
 What? It's hard to explain. 
 I'll give you a call. 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 So... You get a date out of this little adventure? 
 Well, as you said, a cop and a neurosurgeon, not exactly a match. 
 Sure about that? 
 ♪ It's all right ♪ 
 Give me a minute. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks for helping us. 
 Erika created a perfect virus, but she never meant to hurt anyone. 
 She just became obsessed. 
 I don't think I understand that kind of obsession. 
 I do. 
 How did you know Erika's password was the molecular formula for Moxopan? 
 A hunch. 
 You're looking at me like you didn't want my help. 
 But you took it, didn't you? 
 We make a good team, Lindy. 
 You and I. Don't let me down. 
 I have such high hopes.
