 Previously on "Eye Candy..." 
 You're my sister, not my parent. 
 (Screaming) 
 Sara! 
 I know you're trying to find your sister. 
 I'm sorry, Lindy. 
 Lying about being a cop? 
 I'm Ben. 
 Lindy. 
 Or when you turned me in? 
 You know, as part of your parole, you weren't supposed to put your hands near a computer. 
 People go missing every day. 
 I found your website. People said you could help. 
 If they knew you were doing charity work on their dime, no bueno. 
 Where did you go, Julia? 
 You have to get back out there. 
 Since when were you trolling Flirtual? 
 Sophia's idea. 
 When was I ever the kind of girl who used an app to meet guys? 
 You called me Eye Candy? 
 Can we grab a drink sometime? 
 I'm a doctor. 
 Name's Reese. 
 The hell is that? 
 What if someone is using. 
 Flirtual to stalk and maybe kill people? 
 We are gonna catch this crazy, I promise. 
 (Grunting) 
 Where is he? 
 Ben! 
 It's too late to save me. 
 I love you, Ben! 
 I had to kill Ben, but we are just getting started. 
 Right this way. I have you booked for the Shambala facial... that includes a head and shoulder massage. 
 We'll begin face up. I'll let you get settled, and we'll be right back.

 (Light water running) 
 I've had problem skin my entire life. 
 It's really oily, always breaking out. 
 You can probably see the scars. 
 Skin. 
 You can't make it better by smearing it with creams and lotions.

♪♪ What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? So, that look's got nothing to do with the fact that Lindy's on the dance floor with one of the creeps she met on Flirtual? I know what she's doing. And what is that? She's trying to find. Ben's killer. Okay, that doesn't sound healthy at all. ♪ With our eyes wide open ♪ You wanna go? Yeah. ♪ We rise and fall ♪ 
♪ Are you serious? What the hell is she doing with him? She has no idea what just happened. She's gonna screw this whole thing up and get herself killed. (Sighs) (Phone ringing) One sec. Hello, mom. What are you doing? Kinda busy right now. What's up? What's up? Is the last girl that Reese Hennessy met off Flirtual was found dead this afternoon with her face melted off. Oh, no. That's terrible. Yes, it is. I'd advise you to get out of there now. Okay then. Thank you. Everything okay? Yeah, um... My mom's just been ill recently, and, um... Yeah, I... I hate to do this, I just... I have to get going. I can't say I'm not disappointed. Look, I'm headed out of town over the weekend. I want more of you before I go. I'll let you know. You having fun? Not particularly. Did it look like I was having fun? Looks like your obsession with finding Ben's killer is messing up our surveillance. Then, why don't you arrest him already? We were about to, but, you got in the way. You need to let us do our job, Lindy. That girl today? She'd still be alive if you had done your job. That's not fair. I know you're angry. Look, I'm angry, too. Ben and I were friends long before we were cops. Our families grew up together. You know the look his mother gave me at his funeral? Regret. Regret she had ever trusted me with his life. You know the look I got? Blame. Hi. Hi. You're up early. Yep. It's hard to sleep when your best friend's out every night doing what with who-knows-who. I'm fine. Really? Yes. I've just been walking around all night. It's not anything you need to think about. (Scoffs) Okay. Then, what is this? You're watching the guys from Flirtual. I think you're thinking about it a lot. You've been following them, haven't you? Yes. Why were you hiding this from me? Because I didn't want you to worry. Okay, well, I'm worried! This is worried! It is not your fault what happened to Ben. Yes, it is! And if any of the creeps that I dated killed Ben, I'm going to find out. Why should you? You are not some superhuman person, okay? You are just Lindy. Let the police handle it. You know I can't trust them. I'm just gonna go out on a limb here, and say that romancing a murderer is not exactly a good idea. Well, it's the only idea I have. Well, it's not a good one. Look, I know I might be obsessing over something that doesn't exist that these could just be two normal guys. But, I need to do this, or else I will go insane. I'm not gonna lie and say that I approve. (Sighs) ♪ ♪ Thanks. (Music playing) Is that the ethiopian or the organic? The bolivian. They have a secret stash. Ahh. I just love coffee. Live off it. You must really like this place. Yeah, sure, it's... It's great, I guess. I just notice that you come in here a lot. Every day for two weeks. You noticed me? I noticed that we're directly across the street from. Jake Bolin's apartment. Who are you? Sergeant Catherine Shaw, head of the Cyber Crimes Unit, NYPD. And I hear you've been running your own surveillance on the suspects. Oh, look. Right on time. Suspect number one, Jake Bolin. Australian, works as a lawyer, shops organic, prefers to run than go to the gym, and is actually the last person I would pin as a murderer. But, that always piques my interest. Reese Hennessy, on the other hand, dated the latest victim, has one charge of sexual assault that was dropped due to lack of evidence, takes sleeping pills, drinks on average 1.3 liters of vodka a week, and recreationally uses cocaine and MDMA. Murderer, maybe. Husband material, not so much. You think this impresses me? You can sit outside their apartment all night, for all I care. But, loading spyware onto their phone jeopardizes any case we can build against them. You won't stop me. I don't wanna stop you. I wanna help you... help us. People like me don't work for people like you. The police? The good guys? When your department arrested me, I kinda lost faith in authority. Yeah, that grey area where you like to work between us and the bad guys? It can get real foggy down there. I'd hate for you to lose your way. I'll keep my eyes open. I know the police failed to find your sister. And for that, I am truly sorry. But, I can make it up to you. My department can give you the access and resources to help people. Help yourself, and find your sister. ♪ ♪ (Camera clicking) Everyone wants to play with you, Lindy. Okay then. (Chuckles) Let's play. The last time we went on vacation, we went to atlanta to visit my family. It's that moment when you realize you did everything together. You think to yourself, I'm gonna tell 'em this or that about my day. But, they're just gone. It's been two months. I've heard nothing. We were getting married. She was... she was so full of life. How does someone like that just disappear? (Buzzing) (Computer chirping) (Buzzing) Flowers are a bit much, aren't they? Uh... I thought we were gonna meet at the restaurant. How did you know where I live? Oh, I wanted to surprise you. Thought maybe I could, uh, cook you dinner? Cooking. You're cooking me dinner? Yeah. Shall I come in? Uh... yeah. ♪ ♪ Where do you keep the knives? (Chuckles) I have to admit, I've actually never cooked anything in this kitchen. Wow, how very new york of you. I've never been good at it. Well, just takes practice. I panic. There are liquids, and oils, and meats getting burnt, and it's too delicate. Are you saying I'm delicate? No. Look, cooking is just about overcoming the fear of the unknown by calmly implementing the rules and knowledge of what it takes to achieve an outcome. It can be very profound. Shitake mushroom? I'm not sure what makes me more terrified. The mushroom or what I just said? Lindy? Hi! I thought you were going out. We were out, now we're back. What's this? Jake, this is my roommate Sophia and her friend Connor. Yeah, I remember, from the club. Are you... are you cooking? Is... is he cooking? Wow. Yeah, I, uh, surprised Lindy. Have you guys eaten? (Together) No. (Together) No. (Chuckles) Well, I have way too much food. So, stay, enjoy, and then, you can tell me all of Lindy's secrets. We'd love to. Thank God you're here. What is going on? Okay, I had plans to meet him at a restaurant, and he just showed up with groceries. I couldn't exactly tell him to leave. Yes, you could! And who just shows up with groceries? That is definitely weird. I need you to be straight up with me. Is there a serial killer in my house right now? I don't think so. Is he still a suspect? Not exactly. Not exactly? Okay, then what exactly is he? They found another victim this afternoon. Her face melted off. What? She was dating Reese Hennessy. Okay, so he's the one. He's our guy. The police think so. Okay, so, at least we know. Knowing... knowing is good, right? (Knocking) I know how charming and handsome I am, but I really don't think your gentleman caller came to hang with me. What's he doing? Same thing he was doing when you left. Cooking. Okay, but, like, a normal person cook, or like a killer cook? Like someone who really wants to impress her. You weren't invited. Okay, Connor? This is a really stressful and complicated situation. So, I really need you to behave. Look, I get it. This beautiful man might be hiding something. He might not be who he says he is. He could totally mess with your life. Sounds a lot like dating in new york. We're staying. If he is the killer, he can't cut all our heads off. Are you sure? Yeah. I do Krav Maga. Thanks. Just don't eat the food. Poison seems more his style. (Sighs) So, I grew up in Australia, always wanted to move to the States. I went to law school in Chicago, and then, when I got accepted into the law firm here, I jumped at the chance. But, um, I never asked you. Where did you grow up? Upstate, near Albany. Why'd you pick Brooklyn? To meet fabulous friends like us! (Chuckles) I'm gonna sound crazy, but I remember the night we met. I was, um... I was looking across the club, and I saw Lindy, and I had this weird feeling inside of me that I needed to know her. Come on, you've never told me this. That's Sophia for you. One of the kindest girls I know. She loves to pick up strays. (Laughs) I'm serious! It was like a past life thing. And then, she told me she just got into town. Don't ask me why, but I insisted she stay with me. (Chuckles) And I've never left. Is there a past life thing between us, too? Oh, sweetie, you are plenty to handle in the day to day. (Laughter) Well, to the day to day. To the day to day. Day to day. ♪ ♪ (Car horn honking) He's funny. You're funny. He knows Rafael. Rafael? Yeah, a carpenter, builds incredible furniture. From Milan? I don't know Raphael. Yes, you do, he's been here several times. It is so crazy, how total strangers have friends in common. We live in new york, it's not that crazy. (Phone buzzing) Oh, that's my cab. Sorry, I've gotta meet a client early tomorrow. You cooked, we'll clean. Great to meet you. I'll be right there. Killer or not, he is really hot. Well, he didn't slit our throats. That's a good start. ♪ Came to face with all ♪ 
♪ our limitations ♪ 
♪ I think I'll ignore mine ♪ 
♪ Next time I'm with you, convince me to stay a little longer. I haven't had anyone cook for me in a while, so... All right. You again. What was that? None of your business. Is this all some kind of game to you? Reese Hennessy has an alibi. Coworkers say he was in his office all day when his date was killed. Whoever this guy is, he's out there somewhere, waiting, watching. You think I don't know that? You need to stop this and let the police do their job. This doesn't make sense. What took you so long? You know it's like, 3 a.m., right? I was deep in the rem. What are we doing? I need to break into the city's security cameras. Specific block, specific time. No, Lindy. That's so illegal. I... I love it! Oh, yes. Who's gonna make you cry? 
 
 I'm brute-forcing my way in. Looks like a weak 12-digit password. You ready? Yeah. Almost. Almost. Got it. Zinc gummy bear 1-3-3-4-5. Potato meow 65 lizard. You know that doesn't qualify as a phonetic alphabet. Um... it does to me. I'm in. He killed his latest victim at this spa at around 4 p.M. These cameras show the surrounding streets. Okay? You see it? What? (Typing) Empty parking spot here. Camera pans off, and now, the parking spot is filled... Giving him enough time to enter in the back of the spa. It's his car. I know it's his car. Yaeger, listen. Alibi or not, I wanna continue the tail on Reese Hennessy. Yeah, and Jake Bolin. Yep, 24 hours a day. Detective. Lindy thinks she can help us with our investigation. She believes Reese Hennessy's alibi is a fake. Wanna go on a date? With the spyware Lindy loaded onto the suspect's phone, we have a much clearer idea of their movements. Yes, and Resse Hennessy's phone didn't move from his office when Emily was killed, corroborating his alibi. Doesn't that seem odd to you? What phone doesn't move one inch for almost two hours? Yeah, she has a point. Lindy, that's just a car roof. That's not. Do you know how many makes and models of that car are listed in the Tri-state area? There's no view of the license plate, how are we gonna prove this? His car is state-of-the-art, entirely hackable. Hard drive records all its telemetry... every turn, tire pressure, fuel usage. It could almost drive itself. His car gonna drive us all the way to his murderous lair? Detective? What if he snuck out of the office and no one knew? The car will tell us exactly where he was that day, and his alibi will fall apart. What we do know, is he's booked on a flight to Rome tomorrow. He may be making a run for it, so we're doing this. He lives in a secure building on the waterfront. Drives out, drives in. Can't get near it without a warrant. Well, actually, we're going for sushi tonight. I asked him to pick me up. While she entertains Reese, you retrieve all the data from his car. You've got five hours. Can I have a word? This isn't a good idea. She's not trained for this, sergeant. We'll have eyes on her in the restaurant, he's not gonna try anything in public. It's not him I'm worried about. I have no idea what she'll do from one moment to the next. She's completely unreliable. Reckless? Yes. That's why I like her. Reminds me of myself at that age. You're not gonna ruin my little trip down nostalgia lane, are you? There's nothing nostalgic about you, sergeant. Do you wanna catch this guy? Of course I do. Then, we need to trust that she might be on to something. Are you sure this is just about catching a killer? Push this, detective. Push me, and I will remove you from this case. Truth is, I prefer to have her working with us, where I can keep an eye on her, for our sake. (Sighs) And hers. She does this, and it could go very wrong, fast. Let's try and not let that happen.

Checking for you. No, that bridge doesn't open after sunset. He knows he's being followed. He's manipulated the bridge. You look nervous. You gonna give me an idea of where we're going? You'll see. Where the hell is she? Her cell signal just disappeared. Is it being blocked? Or maybe a low-signal area. It's hard to tell at the moment. Who the hell is this guy? Find her! What do you think? Definitely the first date I've had in a junkyard. I like to take a girl to a place she's never been before. Place belongs to my family. I, uh, spent my childhood running through these piles of metal.

Cars are like people. They have all their stories. Where they went, someone had their first kiss, holidays. (Phone buzzing) Someone died. Cars are our friends. Till one day, they get too old. Damaged. And we just dump them. I never thought of it like that. ♪♪ You know what's crazy, is that I sell these big, fancy cars. And the people that buy them, they feel so important, and immortal. But, eventually, every car will end up like this. We all end up like this. You know... Makes you realize how temporary everything is. Better start living our lives now, right? What's the matter? You were all over me the other night. I just wanna take it slow now. You seem like a nice guy. That's bull. I'm not a nice guy. I thought that's what this was, we just have some fun. Maybe we should call it a night. Hey! This is my last night in town. I wouldn't have wasted my time if I knew you weren't up for it. I'll get a cab. Wait. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Lindy, get me outta here. Come on! I'm in the back! Tommy, he's controlling the car, I'm trying to disconnect it. Lindy, come on, lin... Lindy, get me out! I'm trying, hold on! Oh, my God. Tommy! I'm almost there, just give me one second. (Brakes screeching) (Sighs) Tommy? Are you okay? (Groans) Thanks. That could have ended badly. Any sign of Reese? No. It was all a set up. Where's Reese? Disappeared. NYPD is searching the area. We've got a city-wide alert. Well, this didn't go well, did it? Okay, can you please just explain to us why we are here? Just sit there. Are we being arrested or what? Because if not, I demand an explanation. Sit. Oh, my God, Lindy. Okay, so, I suppose I should be happy you finally went to the police. What's happening? You didn't tell her, did you? Maybe you should just let it all out for everyone. Okay, what is he talking about? I know I'd love to know. If you don't tell them, I will, because they're involved, too. Involved? I didn't sign up for being involved. Please define. I'm working with the cyber crimes unit to catch the killer. Wait, what? W-working? No, no, Lindy, I... okay, I said... I said go to the cops, not with them... anywhere! That's dangerous! Okay, come on, you said you couldn't trust them. We know that Reese is the killer. How can you be sure? Because of this. What is that? It's me. It's my life since Ben died. We're all in it? I'm on here. Why am I on here? Reese has been following me all along. I'm sorry, but none of you can leave tonight till we catch him. When are you expecting that will be? Great, right, okay then. Hey, why didn't you tell me you were working with them? I should probably let you two talk. You said go to the police. I did not say to work with them. Okay, look, they hurt you before. Lindy, they'll hurt you again, they don't care. I had to do this. Are you trying to fix the past? You know no one can do that. Okay? It's dust. Lindy, it's gone. Look, all I know is you and I are here now. We are alive. And as your best friend, I don't know what I would do if anything happened to you. Nothing is going to happen. (Camera clicking) You lost? No, trying to get a signal. Okay, well, I'd prefer if you sit over there. S-sure. Just trying to give Lindy and Sophia some space. Well, room's pretty big. I'd say there's plenty of space. That's quite some view. You must spend a lot of nights here alone. What a shame. Are you trying to flirt with me? Would you like me to flirt with you? Sorry. But I'm only into blondes. (Clicks tongue) Want some coffee? God knows how long we'll be trapped inside this dungeon. Lindy? Sure. (Phone buzzing) (Phone beeping) (Muffled screaming) Lindy? Lindy? Why... why are you doing this? What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? What do you want?! What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? Reese isn't the killer. He's his latest victim.
