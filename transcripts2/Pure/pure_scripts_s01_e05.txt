 Previously on  Pure. 
 I'm coming back, Noah Funk, and when I do, 
 I will hurt you in every way I know how. 
 All the charges against the Mennonites have been dropped. 
 So if you can still find your own badge, I want it on my desk. 
 I keep my sketches in my room so my dad doesn't realize who's been tagging the walls all over town. 
 It's working. 
 Don't ask me how, but this sh1t  is now 98.5% pure. 
 What is going on up there? 
 Agent O'Reilly,  my ass is hanging out the window, and I need your help. 
 I want to make a trade. 
 My freedom for the new delivery system. 
 You come and I will Nee.  You come show me here. A day after tomorrow, there will be a plane waiting at the airstrip outside of Chatham. These are my terms. (eerie music) (relieved sigh) What is that? "V," which stands for? No, all these notes. Noah goes here. Abel goes there. (Noah sighs.) These are Bronco's notes. Mhm. Where did all this come from? I don't know. Na oba! And now, Voss wants me to come to Mexico. With the chemist. (knocking on door) (sigh) ♪ 
♪ (buzzing) (distant siren) (indistinct radio message) (long buzzing) Free. Where's your truck? I lent it to Noah. You what?! His buggy's too slow. So you just give it to him? He was new  Bauss. (Gerry chuckling) Well, baby brother, it's time we get it all back. Ah, ah, ah! (truck door opening) (tires screeching) (tinkling) (birds singing) (rooster crowing) (cow mooing) Where is Tina? She said she was going to catch the bus with Marta at the Hostetlers'. She left right after the milking. (Noah clearing his throat) Noah. Hmm? Uh... times have been hard for the  Edentaler  in Mexico... drought, crime... which means, uh... They have to sell everything. It's unfortunate, but there is plenty of valuable equipment up for auction. And better they sell to us than take pennies on the dollar from some  Auslander  auctioneer. Which is why your uncle and I are going on a trip. Isaac : You're going to Mexico? Jo.  But only to do our business and then come straight back. I promise we'll be here for your baptism. Brooda? Hmm? Can I have a word with you, please? The whole point was to bring Voss here, to get him on the wire here, to arrest him here! Not in Mexico! He wants to see the process there, in Mexico. He expects me to bring the chemist who thought of the plan. He can't meet that guy! Oh, so now I'm just another lie of yours? You're going to go to your death in Mexico, so why not bring your useless  Brooda  too? I'm off the drugs now. I know. I know. I need you,  Brooda. The only way we can do this is together. We have to trust in God. That He has a plan. It's not God I'm worried about. ♪ Jo. ♪ Huh? Mexico, right? Jackpot! OK, because of my former boss, Voss knows that I'm on to him. The good news is, though, he doesn't know that we're a team and that I'm speaking to the D.E.A. So we just stick with the game plan. You get him on a wire talking business. You know he's gonna check us, right? Voss is not stupid! He'll assume you are, OK? Look, I suppose you two are not exactly the people police would hire as criminal informants. That's right. Because you're not a real policeman, are you? Just get him on a wire and leave the law to me, OK? Let's do this. (engine revving up) Hello. I am a good worker. I can clean for you. Just for a place to sleep. I got eight rooms to go. Do those for me, and I won't tell a soul who's in room 5. You keep the doors locked and tell the children, all of them. You tell them everything. And you'll need help. Someone we trust. Isaac can't do the chores by himself... We'll manage. The baptism. Promise me he'll be baptized. Noah, I will take care of it. When I return, we will go back to the old ways. As God intends. OK. (Noah sighs.) (cow mooing) (doorbell ringing) Hi, I'm Agent O'Reilly. I'm looking for a Detective Novak. Hey. How ya doing? Agent O'Reilly. Do you mind showing my son some ID? Otherwise, he's not gonna let me out of here. Sure. Don't worry. I promise I won't keep him. I'll be in the car. Nice to meet you. Yeah. I'm only gonna be gone a couple of days. Is this about Tina and her family? I need you to stay away from them for a while, OK? Until the dust settles. Here's some cash for some groceries. I think there's only peanut butter in the fridge. OK, I'll see you. OK. Take care, pal. You too. (Abel making engine noise) OK. ♪ Noah, Anna, this is Agent O'Reilly. Mrs. Funk. Nice to meet you Mrs. Funk. Mr. Funk. I just want to say "thank you," and assure you that, from now on, you and your brother will have the full support of the D.E.A. It takes a lot of courage to do something like this. No. It's desperation. Not courage. This is my brother Abel. Nice to meet you. And this is Ezekiel? Nice to meet you, Ezekiel. Ezekiel does not speak much English. Right. Ezekiel has a uncle in Mexico, Jonas Janzen. Lives far away from the colony in Juarez. Abel : How do you know this? Social services. He wants his nephew back and, according to the law, we gotta give him back. (Abel talks in Low German) My  Brooda  stood up to the Epps to save his life. We all did. You're gonna give him back now? I appreciate that, but his uncle has no ties to Voss or the drug trade. OK? And the Epps are still here so he is not out of danger. Don't worry. I'll watch over him until he gets there. ♪ (emotional music) (Anna sniffling) Alright. Noah : You go pack him a bag. Jo. Goot. Excuse me. Promise me that you will bring my husband back safely. I promise. (thunder rumbling) (tinkling) (cow mooing) (door opening) (door closing) Is Tina home? She was not at school? No. I asked Marta and she said that Tina didn't get on the bus with her and nobody's seen her at school today. (thunder rumbling) (birds singing) (tinkling) (thunder rumbling) (dinging) (vehicle approaching) (dinging) (thunder rumbling) Is Tina here? I promise I won't punish her. I just want to make sure she's safe. She's not here. Please help me find her. OK. Voss keeps shifting his operation. He's opportunistic and unpredictable. If he has paid off the police, why does he keep moving locations? Can't pay 'em all off. I have some friends down there who would love dearly to nail his hide to the wall. Noticing anything different about your bible? Oh no, this is not my bible; this is the one Bronco found near the Janzen's car. There's a listening device and GPS glued on the cover. The antenna is sewn into the stitching of the spine. It's voice activated, omnidirectional. When we have what we need, I'll go to Special Ops who'll go to  Federales  who will hit Eli so hard, there'll be nothing left but his smoking boots. If something happens to us, uh, who will look after our family? Listen, if anything happen... No, I don't want to hear from you, OK? I want to hear from a real policeman. Policewoman. Agent. Agent. I need you all to realize that this is very dangerous, OK? But if anyone can get him to talk business, it's you. What should I get him to say? Nothing. Don't try to lead him. Voss is too smart. (cell phone buzzing) Now, he picked you because you are a man of God, a gentle man. So just be that. Be yourself. Ben, you OK? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. What's going on? How long has she been missing for? OK. Listen. No, do not go to the police. Listen. Check gas stations, restaurants, bus stops. Chances are when she gets hungry, she's gonna go home. OK. Take a deep breath and just call me when you find her, OK? (indistinct, angry shouting) (sigh) (Thump!) (Tina sighs.) (indistinct, angry shouting) (woman laughing) Man : Hey! You two, shut up! It's late! (crickets chirping) (vehicle approaching) (dinging) Do you have her?! Look who learned how to drive. Where is Tina? Forgiveness. Vergebung. It's harder than it sounds in church, isn't it? If you hurt my daughter... You'll what? Justina's been so busy since I went away. You will dig her a new garden; that's what you will do. You will come tomorrow and do whatever she tells you. And when your husband and his pathetic brother crawl out from whatever rock they're hiding under, they will do what I tell them. Go. Nee, Eefelt!  Anna will walk home. It's only five miles. She can use the time to reflect. (crickets chirping) ♪ 
♪ Come on. Let's go. So how you wanna play this? Tech advisor? Officer exchange? Yeah. You know, we don't think it's a good idea for an ex-cop from Noah's home turf to be seen anywhere around the office. OK. That makes sense. So where do you want me to set up? Actually, we got you a room, so... if we need you, we'll call you, alright? Whoa. What are you talking about? This is my case. They're my assets. I'm not sitting this out, Agent O'Reilly. You had Voss cornered on the second floor of a farmhouse in a place where people escape in buggies. So how exactly did he get away? You weren't there so you don't know. You know, Voss depends on cops like you to stay in business. Overconfident and underprepared. Not nearly as smart or brave as they like to think they are. If I get another shot at taking down Voss, I don't want you going through that door with me. We clear? OK. Yeah. Here's your  per diem. There's a T.G.I. Friday down the road from your motel. Why don't you buy yourself a beer and take a victory lap. Dammit! 
 
 (phone ringing) (Beep!) Yes? Gerry Epp :  Look to your left across the street. What the hell are you doing? Getting your attention, since you've been ignoring my calls. Because you just got out of remand. Well, now I'm back. And you need to help me find a runaway. You shouldn't be calling me. I just need a location. Leave the rest to me. The name is Tina Funk. (sinister music) (Beep!) (inaudible conversation) (cell phone ringing) (Beep!) Jay here. Hey, Jay, it's Bronco. Don't hang up. Listen. We were set up, the both of us. I found the phone. It was taken from evidence and given to Joey Epp. Oh, for Christ's sake. It was Kingsley. She needed to protect herself,  and then she put the evidence bag in your desk. She set us up and then fired me to sink the case. OK, I don't know how to tell you this, but, uh, I'm sorry that I thought it was you, OK? I'm... I'm ashamed of myself. Yeah, well, I'm ashamed of you too. So one more thing. The pastor's daughter, she's ran off, and Ben's been looking for her. I think he needs your help. Yeah. I'll see what I can do. I'll probably be sorry I asked you this, but why can't you get her? Uhh, I'm in a rental-car parking lot in El Paso, Texas, about to stake out the D.E.A. Yeah. ♪ 
♪ 
♪ (fluctuating tone) Belonged to the boy's mother. He wanted me to bring it. And I told you to bring the chemist. Instead, you bring your  Brooda. Jo. The chemist is a drug addict dentist who uses too much of his own product to be reliable. Abel is cured now, and this job requires two people. (fluctuating tone) (indistinct chatter) Alright. (phones ringing) Why don't you have a seat right there, OK? Now, I need to get a message to your family to let them know that you're here and I will be right back. O'Reilly. Get ready to dance. I.A. boys are here asking questions about those bodies we sent to Voss without a sign-off from the Ops Chief. Oh, not now. Oh, hey, Natalie. Um, Ezekiel, this is Natalie, and she has some lunch for you, OK? And I will be right back. I promise. ♪ (inaudible conversation) So, Ezekiel, you ever had onion rings? ♪ 
♪ (sigh) (Beep! Beep!) (phone ringing) Woman :  Hello? The last time I called, your boss had bought her own plane ticket to Ontario. Why do I get this feeling she's back? She is. And she brought a boy back with her. "Ezekiel Janzen." By the way, this is way more than I agreed to. We need to renegotiate. I'll let you know where to take him. (muffled baby crying) (muffled, indistinct chatter) (menacing music) (word in Low German) You don't have to live this way. You could be working for me. Why not?  Mama  and  Voda  do. Don't be like your  Voda. (words in Low German) Too proud. (door closing) (clanking) (handle shaking) (crickets chirping) ♪ Promising. Tomorrow morning. Sunrise. (distant siren) Hey, your dad called. Said you might need some help. (sniffling) (sighing) (distant phone ringing) (clanking) How soon? 90 minutes. Then, we fluff it. Then, it's ready for packaging. Can I have a word? I, uh... I want to talk about our deal. Once you have the cocaine out for delivery in the milk trucks, you release me and my family from your service,  Jo? Do you think I became  Bauss  by bargaining with men that already belong to me? I belong to God. You can't take that from me. After everything that you've done,  Pradja  Funk, and everything that you will do, you still believe God will embrace you in his infinite love? Do what you want with me, but let Abel go, let my family go back to a plain life. Come with me. Bring that. (indistinct chatter) (birds honking and clucking) Our bishop doesn't like my business, so they've all been excommunicated. They can't receive communion, but I told them you could do it. (rooster crowing) We both know those who have been set back cannot join the Lord's Supper. Which is why I'm asking you to do it,  Pradjda. Communion service for the excommunicated is meaningless. Not to them. Any one of these righteous men so eager to remember the blood of Christ would not hesitate to shed yours or your family's if I give the word. They've killed for me before, they will again. I am the only God you have,  Pradja  Funk. (Noah talking in Low German) (vehicle approaching) (dinging) Hey! How will she move the soil without a shovel? With her hands? I will do it! Joey... Joey, where is she? Please, where did he take her? I don't know. I don't. Every day, he makes you smaller. Soon, there will be nothing left. Gerry : What are you doing?! Joey. No, no. What are you doing?! Never forget,  Kjinjabrooda. I'm the only boss you have. This isn't right. You have your own work to do! ♪ Get on with it. ♪ 
♪ 
♪ 
♪ (beeping) ♪ 
♪ 
♪ Noah :  Nee. ♪ Hah-hah! (sniffing) ♪ (Abel sniffing) Jo. (birds singing) (vehicle honking) (softly): Ezekiel? Ezekiel! Oh. Hi. Are you alright? (O'Reilly sighing) Hey, Boss. Hey. You slept here? Yes, the back's killing me. Had to keep an eye on my guys. You know. So listen, I made contact with Ezekiel's uncle last night.I  can take him if you want. Mm-mm. No, I wanted to be there. I know but you've been here all night. I'll look after him. I promise. Call me every step of the way. Absolutely. Alright, you know me. (laughing): I do. Alright. Hey. I'll be seeing you, OK? You take care. Thanks, Natalie. (Natalie chuckles.) (indistinct chatter) (sigh) I got it. Abel : You got what? What we came for. Voss on the wire. How? (indistinct chatter) By turning the other cheek. So we can go home? Jo. I am so sorry,  Brooda. For what? Asking you to help me. I had no right. Yeah, well, you were always a pushy little  Ploag. I'm joking. Not really. You see, Noah, if this doesn't work out, you know, if God has a... a different plan... you should know that these last few weeks, I finally felt like I was doing some good. You've always been good. Not in deed maybe, but in your heart. You know what I mean. (back-up beeper) Bring him to the quarry. The one we've used before on the border. Jo, Jo.  More money as we agreed. Her too? Jo. What about the  Pradja  and his  Brooda? Nee.  Pradja (ominous music) And make sure he brings his bible. ♪ If you follow us, I'm gonna have agent Ortiz here shoot your tires out from under you. They're on the move, aren't they? Have a nice day. (frustrated sigh) ♪ (thumping) Ah! (Tina panting) (Tina sobbing) O'Reilly : Just across the border. We're at Santa Teresa heading north. ♪ ♪ It's him. Why is he here? Why do you think? (buzzing) sh1t! (beeping) (phone ringing) Come on! Pick up, goddammit! (buzzing) They're stopped about 4 miles ahead. (buzzing) (Beep!) Woman :  D.E.A. El Paso. How may I direct your call? Yes. My name is Bronco Novak.I 'm working with Agent O'Reilly I need to get her an urgent message: she's heading into an ambush. Please hold, Mr. Novak. You kidding me? (wind blowing) Diene Bieble. And whatever you have in your pockets. Ohhh... (Voss tutting) ♪ Come. ♪ 
♪ Where's Voss? (gunshot) ♪ 
♪ Ezekiel! I'm going in. Cover me. (gunshots) Ugh! (indistinct shout) Take cover! (O'Reilly grunting in pain) I'm good. I'm OK. I'm good. Got me in the vest. (gunshots) ♪ (Voss sighs.) Remember our deal? You work for me and your family is safe?  Jo? You are not a man of your word,  Pradja,  but I am. ♪ (Voss sighs.) (clinking) (Voss sighs.) Hmm. (gunshot) No! (dramatic music) Ah!  Nee! Nee! Nee! Abel!
