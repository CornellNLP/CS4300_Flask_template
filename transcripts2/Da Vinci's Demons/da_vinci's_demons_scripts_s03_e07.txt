 (Riario roars) 
 I want to help you. 
 (Roars) 
 (Gasps) Wait! 
 Tell me what it says! 
 (Dog barks) 
 (Chain clanking) 
 Argh! 
 (Clattering, Lupo groans) 
 (Grate slams) 
 You're safe now. 
 We live dangerous lives in dangerous times. 
 All I want is for Giulio to have a happy, peaceful life. 
 But you are also the new Mother of Florence. 
 Do not ignore your people. 
 Prisoner : 'Lorenzo de'Medici, your place is with us.' 
 Lorenzo : 'I would sooner drown.' 
 Vannucci : 'Sixtus cannot be trusted.' 
 No assurance of safety. 
 Cellini : He may be the only thing that keeps Florence from crumbling. 
 We should offer our support! 
 Enough! 
 Go on, finish it. Close the circle. 
 Or you can choose. 
 (Softly) Wake up! 
 (She gasps) 
 Take the Page to Florence. I swear to you, Leo'll be there and he'll help you. Go. 
 We will find the Page, with or without your help. 
 (Gasps) 
 (Oriental-style music) 
 (Labored breathing) 
 (Distant voices) 
 Cellini : Genoa! Genoa pledges 6,000 longbow men! 
 (Cheering) 
 And 1,000 infantry! 
 (Wild cheering) 
 Venice pledges 200 galleys. 
 (Cheering) 
 Last we heard, you had 500 warships at your disposal. 
 (Laughter) 
 And how many lanze spezzate does His Holiness pledge? 
 (Spectators murmur) 
 The entire Papal Army should be engaged! 
 (Cheering) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Woman screams)- Turk! 
 (People screaming) 
 b*st*rd Turk! 
 Guards! 
 Guards, stop him! 
 (Women screaming) 
 (Grunts) 
 Urgh! 
 (Grunts) 
 Doge : After all, this is your Crusade... (Spectators cheer) ..as you're so apt to remind us! 
 Where is my nephew? 
 (Hubbub of voices) 
 (Cries of astonishment) 
 Cellini : Turk! 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Guards! Guards! 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 (Helmet clatters on floor) 
 (Murmurs of astonishment, Lorenzo gasps)

 (Exhales) 
 The eyes seem normal. 
 (Exhales) 
 How you feeling? 
 Alive. 
 Against all reason. 
 (Birds' wings flutter) 
 You poisoned me? 
 The Labyrinth conditioning was... extensive. 
 But I pushed harder. 
 I had to approach... (Exhales) ..curing you the same way. 
 (Manacles rattle) 
 (Grunts) 
 (Church bells ring in distance, dog barks) 
 The worst is over. 
 Not when I must live with what I've done. 
 Are we sure this is wise? 
 Just trust yourself. 
 (Riario inhales) 
 Start over. 
 (Church bells ring in distance, dog barks) 
 Your next choice is the one that defines you. 
 Hm. 
 Are those new designs? Hm? 
 Mm. Look. 
 Ah. If... You know, I should show you. 
 Ah, look here. 
 This... This device, it launches bombards without the use... 
 (Knock at door) 
 (Knocking persists) 
 Is he here? 
 He believes me to be cured, signora. 
 Are you of the same mind? 
 I'm of sound mind for the first time in quite a while. 
 What I have done, it erm... (Voices cheering outside) ..it cannot be forgiven. 
 Girolamo, that is not for you to decide. 
 Has something happened? 
 (Voices cheering outside) 
 The streets are chaotic. 
 Lorenzo de'Medici has returned. 
 What? 
 (Giulio cries) 
 Shall I take him? 
 No. 
 (Crowd chanting) Vale! Vale! 
 There's no need for that. 
 (Da Vinci panting) 
 Maestro? 
 Lorenzo has returned but... 
 That's fine, that's fine. 
 (Giulio grizzles) 
 (Crowd chanting) Vale! Vale! 
 Vale! Vale! 
 (Chanting continues) 
 (Giulio grizzles) 
 Erm... A moment, please. 
 Everyone, please. 
 (Giulio grizzles) 
 (Exhales) 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 So good to see you. 
 And you, brother. 
 I mean... I'm relieved but... 
 Surprised? 
 I assume you needed the armor to escape, but why wear it all the way to Florence? 
 I was unsure how far up the coast their... their troops had advanced. 
 They had you in servitude? 
 Prisoners of value. 
 Held for ransom... (Grunts) ..or to be bartered. 
 But it soon became clear we were to be their playthings. 
 Digging pits for the bodies of our dead and dying. 
 And then at night, the Turks would burn them - a bonfire in celebration of their victory. 
 And then one morning... (Labored breathing) ..there was this child... who had not yet succumbed to her wounds. 
 And she pleaded for me to help her, I assumed she meant escape, until I saw the blade lodged into her back. 
 (Fire crackling) 
 Her father had tried to spare his child the horrors to come. 
 But he'd only succeeded in taking half her life. 
 And I took the rest. 
 (Exhales) That night... (Grunts) ..when the guard on watch had drunk himself to distraction, we thrust the blade into his neck, stripped him of his armor and buried him in her ashes. 
 (Exhales) 
 (Dog barks in distance) 
 Laura : His Holiness requests your presence. 
 Demands it, actually. 
 He needs the face of the Crusade by his side. 
 (Dog barks in distance) 
 (Blade scrapes on sheath) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 If I ever threaten you again, you must protect yourself. 
 That will not be necessary. 
 You will promise me... or you will return me to my chains. 
 Da Vinci : 'We have raised an army since you were captured.' 
 All of Italy has united. 
 A Crusade armed with new weapons, the likes of which the world has never seen. 
 I've taken precautions this time. 
 I've guarded my thoughts as well as my... 
 Ah. 
 ..as well as my actions. 
 (Lorenzo grunts softly) 
 The Turks will not have these designs. 
 Oh. 
 (Book falls closed) 
 Lorenzo? 
 Take me to her. 
 (Melancholy music) 
 How did it happen? 
 She'd gone to Rome on a mission of vengeance. 
 I learned of our financial losses at the hands of my b*st*rd uncle. 
 Did she suffer? 
 No. 
 Please. 
 I want to know. 
 She was struck from behind. 
 It appears she died instantly. 
 (Gulls cry) 
 How was she found? 
 Her... 
 Her hands and feet were nailed to a post. 
 (Chokes back sob) 
 This is my doing. 
 (Exhales) 
 I betrayed her... abandoned my family. 
 Her death is my penance. 
 Erm... while I was... hunting Clarice's killer... 
 I erm... I found a letter. 
 She... expresses... regret for her failure in your absence and prays for your forgiveness. 
 (Lorenzo sighs) 
 (He stifles a sob) 
 (Exhales) 
 Even in death, she humbles me. 
 And what of you? 
 Have you forgiven Lucrezia? 
 The last time I was in her company, I tried to kill her. 
 And you helped her escape. 
 I haven't seen her since. 
 (Eerie atmospheric music) 
 (Lucrezia moans) 
 (Whimpering and sobbing) 
 (Grate creaks) 
 (Water trickling) 
 You look unwell, Daughter. 
 Perhaps now you are ready to talk. 
 I've told you everything I know. 
 How many others did Lupo hold captive? 
 When I arrived, there was one. 
 There might have been more but... 
 Oh, there were. 
 We found the bodies of three girls... hidden under the house. 
 And yet... a fourth. 
 She has the Page, doesn't she? 
 Tell us where she is taking it... 
 I can't tell you what I don't know. 
 (Chair scrapes on floor) 
 If you won't tell me, you will tell her. 
 (Gedik speaks Turkish) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Laura : We must assume they're prepared to strike. 
 What has Lorenzo said of their movements? 
 Lorenzo is er... is not yet ready to engage. 
 But...I expect his intelligence to be constructive. 
 Once he's willing to offer it. 
 (Inhales) And what say you, Nephew? 
 They erm... They will focus on sacking Salerno and Capua before engaging Naples directly. 
 And once they've taken that, it is a three-day march to Rome. 
 If we fall, you fall. 
 We must strike pre-emptively! 
 A surprise attack could be the opportunity we need to weaken their numbers. 
 If we use our combined fleet... 
 And send in our ground troops to flank them... and bypass the Apulia coast and attack from the south. 
 Where we bombard them from all sides. 
 And put an end to this scourge once and for all. 
 They'll never see it coming. 
 De'rossi : In Otranto, the Turks anticipated our every move. 
 How do we know this time will be different? 
 We don't. 
 But this time, my plans are well concealed. 
 And I have discovered ways to defeat my old designs. 
 What of their armor? 
 We know its origins. 
 It was built for the Order of the Dragon by Prince Vlad of Wallachia. 
 The beast who denied our call to arms. 
 Obviously we can't expect his help. 
 But I have been deciphering the secrets of the armor myself. 
 Mm? 
 I'm close to the answer. 
 "Close" will get us all killed. 
 Caterina : Now tell me again. 
 (Lucrezia grunts) 
 Where is the Page? 
 I don't know. 
 (Gasps) 
 Can you read it? 
 (Gasps) I've never even seen it. 
 What are your plans for it? 
 My plans? (Winces) 
 I don't know what it does. 
 You are working for the Crusade. 
 What? 
 No. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Enough. 
 (Exhales) 
 (Footsteps approaching) 
 Well? 
 You were right. 
 She knows where the Page has been taken. 
 It is on its way to Rome. 
 Do you know why? 
 To be used against the Turks...against you. 
 Your treachery will be repaid, I promise you. 
 (Hubbub of voices) 
 With all of our troops on the battlefield, who will protect our cities? 
 I assure you, signori, the citizens of Florence are safe. 
 (Murmurs of agreement) 
 And yet my wife was murdered... as was my captain. 
 And I walked in here virtually unchallenged. 
 What makes you think that the first Turk assassin will also be the last? 
 His... His Holiness has united all of Italy. 
 (Murmurs of assent) 
 With our amassed armies, we will finally put an end to their savagery. 
 (Shouts of assent) 
 Sixtus has no say over the affairs of Florence! 
 His Holiness, the Crusade and all those who support it... can go f*ck themselves! 
 (Spectators gasp in shock) 
 Il Magnifico! 
 I stand with you. 
 Rome is our longest-standing enemy. 
 You are right to distrust them. 
 The Council... has already voted! 
 (Cries of agreement) 
 I am rescinding the order. 
 Florence's troops will withdraw from the Crusade immediately! 
 You have no authority here! 
 And who will challenge it? 
 You... a man who draws his fortune from the Papal teat? 
 (Ripple of laughter) 
 This is still a republic... (Shouts of assent) ..despite attempts by your family to destroy it! 
 By your philandering brother impregnating local whores! 
 (Shouts of assent) 
 And your beloved Clarice bedding your own relation... leading our city into chaos! 
 (Cries of assent) 
 Oh, my dear Lorenzo. 
 Have you not heard? 
 (Chuckles) Oh, how embarrassing! 
 Man : Whoa! 
 Urgh! 
 (Shocked gasps) 
 (Bone crunches repeatedly) 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (Blood dripping) 
 (Grunts) 
 This is my f*cking city! 
 And I will defend it at any cost! 
 I declare our independence from Rome... from the Church... from all of Italy! 
 From this day forth... Florence stands alone! 
 (Wind blowing) 
 (Guard mumbles) 
 (Key rattles in lock) 
 (Guard shouts in Turkish) 
 Why did you lie to them? 
 You've questioned me before, I know what you can do... reached inside my head and found the truth. 
 We both know the Page isn't on its way to Rome. 
 The Page is headed to Florence. 
 Well, then, I don't understand. 
 Why... Why would you protect me? 
 It is not you I am protecting. 
 Then who? 
 (Whispering) No? 
 Sophia? 
 She's your daughter, isn't she? 
 (Chains jangle) 
 One night, while I was trapped... I awoke to find her speaking to someone who wasn't there. 
 She said her mother brought her messages and that this particular message was for me. 
 I asked you to take her to her brother. 
 Leonardo and Sophia are brother and sister? 
 (Chuckles) 
 Are they safe? 
 Wait, you don't know, you can't see them? 
 The information I receive, it is scattered. (Sighs) 
 I cannot keep watch over them both. 
 Why now? 
 Why do you want to unite them now, after all this time? 
 (Whispering) It is the only way to save them. 
 (Caterina sobs) 
 Why should I believe you? 
 (Sighs) 
 (Inhales sharply) 
 This is my punishment... for refusing to sacrifice my children. 
 You're not Sons of Mithras? 
 I was once. 
 They keep me alive only because they find me useful. 
 But they cannot punish me more than I have punished myself... for not protecting Leonardo. 
 That's why you put Sophia in the convent... to keep her safe. 
 Al-Rahim... your father... they don't even know she exists. 
 Please... help me keep it that way. 
 (Man groans and retches) 
 Ah. Here we are. 
 (Man retches) 
 Yeah, perhaps I should go in alone. 
 Do I appear that frail? 
 Then do not treat me as such. 
 (Dog barks in distance) 
 
 
 
 Well, f*ck me! Maestro! 
 What's it today? 
 Buzzin' the honey-hole? Pokin' the badger? 
 Tempting, that's erm... 
 That's very tempting but... you know why we're here. 
 Mm. 
 Okay, in you go. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Oriental music plays) 
 (People moan in pleasure) 
 (Laughter and chatter) 
 (Giggling and moans of pleasure) 
 (Whip lashes, Lorenzo cries out) 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh. 
 I'm afraid Lorenzo does not wish to be interrupted. 
 Unless, of course, you intend to participate. 
 (Whip lashes, he whimpers) 
 (Grunts) 
 Enough, enough. 
 Enough. 
 Lorenzo. 
 What? 
 You're interrupting my grieving. 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 I can only imagine what you have been through and by the grace of God, survived. 
 I can assure you, God had nothing to do with it. 
 (Lorenzo panting) 
 Da Vinci : Lorenzo, you have to support the Crusade. 
 We need you. 
 No. 
 You scorn the very thing that offers Florence salvation. 
 After everything that the Turks have done to you and your family, how can you abandon us? 
 You see this? 
 This is from Bernardo Baroncelli...of Siena. 
 This? 
 Francesco Pazzi of Tuscany, when he murdered my brother and attempted to assassinate  me at the behest of... Pope Sixtus. 
 And these, these are courtesy of King Ferrante of Naples and his b*st*rd son Alfonso... who only released me from my chains so that I might fight alongside him in defense of his city! 
 So... So, tell me, please, tell me... who is Florence's enemy? 
 Who is my enemy? 
 No, signora, I will not join your... Crusade. 
 I will fight for Florence as I have always done. 
 Well, what do you think I've been doing? 
 Huh? 
 I had to align with Sixtus, for f*ck's sake! 
 That was your mistake, not mine. 
 An alliance with Rome is the only way we win! 
 We cannot win! 
 We can only survive! And that is exactly what you will help me do. 
 Your weapons will now defend Florence. 
 No, Lo... 
 Lorenzo, those weapons are meant for the Crusade. 
 Not anymore. 
 Lorenzo! 
 I want you... and your carnelevare... out of my city now. 
 Madam Singh, have these unwanted guests removed from the premises. 
 Oh, and er... have your men confiscate everything from Da Vinci's workshop. 
 What? 
 Lo... Lorenzo, no, please. 
 Look... you can't do this. 
 You have made your choice... brother. 
 (Da Vinci breathes heavily) 
 Don't touch me. 
 (Bell rings) 
 (Giulio grizzles) 
 (Door opens) 
 Please leave us. 
 (Giulio grizzles) 
 I'm so sorry, Nico, I heard of your dismissal from court. 
 You and Giulio are all that matter. 
 Pack up your things. 
 Vanessa, we must leave. 
 (Sighs) And go where? 
 For now, we'll stay with the Maestro. 
 And then what? 
 And then we... 
 We'll get as far from Florence as we can. 
 My father will give us money and then we can find someplace to settle down. 
 I can look after you and the baby. 
 Nico, I can't leave. 
 Lorenzo will never give up his heir. 
 (Giulio grizzles) 
 And I'm not going anywhere without my son. 
 But you saw what Lorenzo did. 
 He beat a man to death right before our eyes. 
 How can you stay here knowing that a monster sleeps in the next room? 
 If that's what I have to do for him, then so be it. 
 Please! 
 You must go before Lorenzo sees you in my chambers. 
 (Melancholy music) 
 (Papers rustling) 
 f*ck off! 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (Papers rustling) 
 These designs are no use to me. 
 Da Vinci has drafted them in code. 
 I asked the cooks to prepare your favorite. 
 Although, I admit, I did not know what to expect. 
 (Door slams) 
 (Lorenzo's footsteps) 
 Lamb. 
 Where is my lamb? 
 Pour Il Magnifico's wine and then you may leave us. 
 (He inhales) 
 (Exhales heavily) 
 If you keep up that pace, you'll make yourself ill. 
 (Lorenzo slurps) 
 (Grunts and sighs) 
 What is it that you want? 
 'Twas a long day. I wanted to make sure we had a chance to talk. 
 (Chuckles) 
 You disapprove of my actions? 
 No. 
 It's just... Well, we've been friends for a long time, I'll... 
 I'll miss his company. 
 Councilman Cellini? 
 Signor Machiavelli! 
 Cellini was an obnoxious prick whose loyalty to Rome was as disgusting as it was unwise. 
 I shall not miss him. 
 Admittedly, your actions were extreme. 
 But these are extreme times. 
 Machiavelli, eh? 
 (Sniffs) 
 He's Da Vinci's charge, is he not? 
 He provided a much-needed counsel in your absence. 
 Still... you deserve more esteemed company than that of a child. 
 Did you not consider me a child before you left for Naples? 
 (Rustling) 
 Nico and I were both against the Crusade. 
 (Nut cracks) 
 All evidence to the contrary. 
 I lack your fortitude. 
 Hm. 
 But my stance shifted after much deliberation. 
 It must've been difficult... with even Da Vinci on their side. 
 You were in an impossible position and you did what you thought was best. 
 So you're not... angry? 
 Of course not. 
 (Lorenzo's footsteps) 
 (Door opens) 
 You're more like your brother than I realized. 
 My brother was a better man than I. 
 (Nut kernels clatter) 
 He did not have to carry your burdens. 
 I suppose not. 
 Your lamb, Il Magnifico. 
 (Lorenzo clears his throat) 
 They did not forget. 
 Say what you will of my brother. 
 I envy his taste in women. 
 A keen eye, I clearly do not possess. 
 For all of Clarice's sins, never doubt that she loved you. 
 You remind me of her. 
 Strong-willed, unafraid to offer your mind in the face of opposition. 
 (Cutlery clatters) 
 I will say or do whatever I need to protect my son. 
 My only concern is for your nephew and Florence. 
 As is mine. 
 (Chews lustily) 
 (Insects chirping) 
 (Da Vinci grunts) 
 (Sighs) 
 Zoroaster : The Crusade is done. 
 City states are dropping like flies now that Florence has pulled out. 
 Even if you manage to recreate all your designs, who in bloody hell's gonna wield them? 
 (Sighs) 
 You're right. 
 (Scoffs) You couldn't wait for Nico to get back? 
 It'd be great for someone to bear witness to these declarations. 
 Lately... your instincts have been right... more often than mine. 
 (Exhales) What is this? 
 Are you dying? 
 Even with my weapons... we don't stand a chance against the Ottoman Army. 
 We don't have the manpower. 
 (Whispering) Oh, f*ck this! 
 (Whispering) sh1t! 
 (Exhales) 
 Take what's left. 
 And just get somewhere safe... while you still can. 
 And what of you? 
 I will follow the Pageant of Arms to Rome, see if anything can be salvaged of our cause. 
 Right, no. If it means losing everyone I love, I'm not going anywhere. 
 Zo, there is nothing more for you to do here. 
 I am not running away. 
 And you're not going to Rome. 
 We may not have the manpower. 
 But I know of one man powerful enough to turn the tide in our favor. 
 Zo... God! 
 I cannot take on... 
 Absolutely not you, shithead. 
 (Dog barks in distance) 
 I can't believe I'm about to suggest this. 
 (He sighs) 
 Zo? 
 Vlad. 
 Vl... 
 Vlad? Vlad. 
 Vlad. Vlad. 
 Son of Dracul. 
 Hm. 
 Ruler of the Order of the Dragon, Prince of f*cking darkness. 
 And the man that... that you stole from... and I poisoned and we set fire to and we pushed him out of a window. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 I didn't say it was a perfect plan. 
 Even if he is alive and he doesn't slit our throats on sight... what exactly is our pitch? 
 The Ottomans stole his armor. 
 You get the armor's secrets, and the Crusade gets the man who made it. 
 (Makes nonsensical sounds) 
 Inimicus inimici Mei amicus meus est. 
 The enemy of my enemy... 
 Is my friend. Zo... 
 That might work. 
 (Torch flames crackle) 
 This is not your fault. 
 Isn't it? 
 Surely I've played a part in our current circumstance? 
 Lorenzo's people always believed him to be a fair and just leader. 
 The Turks turned him into a tyrant, not you. 
 Regardless, our Crusade lies in ruins. 
 We've lost Siena... Venice. 
 How are we to move forward? 
 One foot in front of the other. 
 We shall find a way. 
 The Crusade is alive as long as we are. 
 And Lorenzo will be left to watch as his beloved Florence burns. 
 "Though our sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool." 
 If the Lord can forgive us our trespasses, we can forgive Lorenzo... as I have forgiven you. 
 I... I do not deserve such kindness. 
 I do not deserve you. 
 (Wind blows strongly on waves) 
 (Moans softly) 
 (Gasps) 
 (Chains rattling) 
 Lucrezia? Lucrezia? 
 What? What is it? 
 The Crusade's in jeopardy. 
 He's leaving Florence. 
 Leonardo? 
 My children will not meet. 
 (Sniffs) 
 Without each other, they face unspeakable horrors. 
 Can you not appear to him as you did to Sophia? 
 He doesn't trust me. He will not listen. 
 (Exhales) 
 There may be another way. 
 You must warn him. 
 Right, these are re-creations of the designs Lorenzo confiscated. 
 Unlike my originals, those aren't written in code, so your engineers should be able to begin assembly immediately. 
 Then you'll not be traveling with us? 
 No. I intend to take a short detour. 
 We need to supplement our ranks. 
 I hope to enlist the Order of the Dragon. 
 I don't need to tell you... 
 No, you don't. 
 Can I at least offer you an escort? 
 We can spare a few men. 
 No, that... That may send the wrong message. 
 Nico : Maestro? 
 (Dog barking in distance) 
 Not exactly the Swiss Guard. 
 (Chuckles) Better. 
 Sixtus : Come on! 
 (Men talking) 
 Enough chatter! 
 Let us leave this wretched city. 
 (Sixtus grunts) 
 (Carriage door closes) 
 Good luck. 
 I will see you in Rome. 
 (Horse nickers, carriage drives off) 
 And we're certain he's all right? 
 Physically, yes. 
 But I can't count for the emotional toil. 
 (Laughs) You found it? 
 Yep, tossed out with Lorenzo's kitchen scraps. 
 Nico had to wade through a mountain of cabbage. 
 Yeah, sorry about the smell. 
 Yeah, you absolutely stink! 
 (Da Vinci laughs) 
 I'm glad to have you back, both of you. 
 It's good to be needed. 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (Horse whinnies) 
 One day, you will open your eyes, signora. 
 And what will I see? 
 That tyranny is brutal and lonely. 
 Especially for those who serve the tyrant. 
 (Tramp of horses' hooves)

 Lucrezia : 'Leonardo?' 
 'Leonardo?' 
 (He breathes heavily) 
 (Faint voice) Leonardo? 
 (Nearer voice) Leonardo? I'm here. 
 Leonardo? 
 (He breathes heavily) 
 (Lucrezia's voice echoes)  I'm here... I'm here... I'm here. 
 Leo. 
 (He gasps) 
 (Sound of bells tinkling) 
 Am I dreaming? 
 I was thinking the same thing. 
 (Breathes heavily) 
 How do I know this isn't a trick? 
 (Romantic music) 
 (Laughs softly) 
 Even if you're only  in my head, I don't care. (Giggling) 
 (Kissing sounds) 
 Leo. 
 I have a message... from your mother. 
 What? 
 Well... where is she? Are you with her? 
 I know you don't trust her. 
 But I do, so I need you to trust me. 
 Everything I'm about to tell you is the truth. 
 There's a girl...Sophia. 
 She has the Page, Leo. 
 The Pa... The Page? 
 (Whispering) Yes. 
 From the Book of Leaves? 
 Oh, I... (Sighs) 
 She's your sister. 
 She's in danger. 
 And so are you. 
 You need to find her before it's too late. 
 My mother told you this? 
 Yes. 
 I found it. 
 I found the Page for you. 
 Your mother said the Crusade would be hopeless without it. 
 Save Sophia. Get the Page. 
 You are the only one who can save us now. 
 (He breathes heavily) 
 (Footsteps approaching) 
 (Zoroaster exhales in his sleep) 
 Zo, Zo, Zo. It's me. 
 Look...I have to leave.

 Your brother will protect you. You will protect each other. 
 My brother? Leonardo? 
 Sophia, please. 
 You must... (Gasps)
