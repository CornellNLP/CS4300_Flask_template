 'The journey before you will be monumental.' 
 Leonardo. 
 It speaks with my mother's voice! 
 Leonardo, please! Please! Don't take the Book away from my people. 
 There was no Book. 
 Who are you? 
 Carlo de' Medici. 
 We are the Labyrinth. 
 The servants of the Horned God will seize their opportunity! 
 You're the Labyrinth? 
 Clarice. 
 Carlo? You took long enough. 
 500,000 florins was withdrawn from the bank. 
 Now Carlo has gone, someone will have to assume the blame. 
 b*st*rd! 
 Clarice has gone, which makes you, as his mother, the regent head of the House of Medici. 
 Girolamo, our suffering will not end until the day you die! 
 'Girolamo Riario, you were dead, now you're born again.' 
 What do you want from me? 
 For you to see what we see. 
 We are one, Girolamo. 
 The man you know as Pope Sixtus is not the true Pope but an imposter. 
 I shall assume the Papal throne at once. 
 Have the decency to spare my daughters. 
 Please, please! 
 From now on, God values what I value. 
 I intend to take my rightful place. 
 Your only mission was to get the son of the Sultan to Rome. 
 Once that was accomplished, the outcome was all but assured. 
 If Bayezid is killed, the result is war. 
 Dishonored and dismissed, retaliation will be required. 
 They will stop at nothing. 
 'In the Kingdom of Naples, a place called Otranto is where you will find what you seek.' 
 'The Ottomans just brought the next holy war to my doorstep.' 
 If the Turks are victorious, it gives them a stronghold to take all of Italy. 
 Unless you enlist a war engineer to help you mount an offensive. 
 We are outnumbered by thousands. 
 We've only got one shot at this. 
 (Panting and grunting) 
 f*ck! 
 (Sailors yell in unison) 
 (Bell rings) 
 Open up! They're coming! Open up! Open up! 
 Don't shoot! Don't shoot, don't! 
 I'm not a Turk, you stupid pricks! 
 (Grunts angrily) 
 Long live Naples! Long live Naples! 
 (Door opens) 
 Ah, thanks! 
 (Clamoring) 
 Man : To the walls! 
 Ready! 
 Hold till they fire! 
 Shoot straight! 
 Keep moving, men! 
 Get back. 
 I'm with Da Vinci. 
 Load the cannon. 
 Load the cannons! 
 (Horn blows) 
 Secure the barbican. Double archers on the south wall. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I can assure you, your precautions will not be necessary. 
 Perhaps. 
 Perhaps I'm unwilling to put all my faith and future in some tinkerer. 
 On my count. 
 (Speaking Arabic): Three... 
 It cannot be. 
 ..two... 
 Now! 
 Leonardo! 
 What is it? 
 The woman on the deck standing next to the Ottoman prince. 
 That is your mother. 
 You cannot fire. 
 I have to. 
 I have to. 
 (Screaming and panicked shouts) 
 Leo. 
 Is it true? 
 Your mother? 
 I had no choice. 
 ♪ DaVinci's Demons 3x01 ♪ 
Semper Infidelis 
Original Air Date on September 25, 2015 
 ♪  ♪ 
 Count Riario? 
 Cardinal Rodrigo. 
 Where is His Holiness? 
 His Holiness is... not himself. 
 Is he of ill humor? 
 Better that you should see for yourself. 
 Deeper, deeper. 
 It is said that devils despise the netherworld, which is why they so gleefully damn us mortals there. 
 He would never believe I would stoop so low, which is why I must. 
 To be free, I must go below. 
 Your Holiness. 
 I told you, leave me be! 
 It's Girolamo, Your Holiness. 
 It is you. 
 Leave us. 
 Enjoying the irony, are you? 
 The captor, now the captive. 
 I see the prisoner has escaped. 
 Aided by someone within my household. 
 My dear brother wants my head on a platter and his wearing the Papal crown. 
 And would endanger his very soul to do so, lying down with those damnable Turkish dogs. 
 And now, the Prodigal returns. 
 Planning your escape, Father? 
 How dare you call me that? 
 Holy Father... I am so very sorry. 
 I prostrate myself before you. 
 My dear boy. 
 What have you done to yourself? 
 Father, I... 
 I despised you so. 
 Because you despised yourself. 
 Oh, I have done monstrous things. 
 I've killed innocents. 
 I have scorned you, betrayed you. 
 I have sought false idols, worshiped false gods. 
 Ssh. 
 It was all at the behest of others. 
 At the behest of me. 
 Come. 
 Let us pray together. 
 (Prays in Latin) 
 (Continues in Latin) 
 Amen. 
 (Thunder crashes) 
 (Knocking at door) 
 Whoever you are looking for, lady, I can tell you now he's not here. 
 Signora de' Medici? 
 Please, come in. 
 Please, this way. 
 I am servant to the House of the Medici. 
 They call me Shbeeb. 
 I know who you are. 
 And I know the nature of the services you provided for my husband. 
 I would do anything for Lorenzo the Magnificent. 
 Indeed. Anything his heart - or other organs desired, I suppose. 
 My husband kept a suite here, I believe. 
 I-I don't know what you mean, signora. 
 A place of respite during those long banking excursions to Rome, Naples... 
 I swear to you... 
 A place where he could bring one of his whores for a good f*ck. 
 This way. 
 We haven't had the pleasure of his company for some time. 
 Neither have I. 
 Will he be joining you? 
 At present, Signor de' Medici is in Naples... killing Turks, I hope. 
 Unlikely he will walk through that door anytime soon. 
 Sit. 
 I need your help. 
 Anything for the House of the Medici. 
 Good. 
 I have reason to believe an enemy of Florence is here in Rome. 
 He must be found and brought to justice. 
 Anyone who aids me in this mission will be handsomely compensated. 
 Who is this man? 
 Lorenzo's uncle... 
 Carlo de' Medici. 
 (Cheering and laughter) 
 A toast to Leonardo Da Vinci, the Savior of Naples. 
 (Cheering) 
 The Savior of Italy. 
 A gold sovereign for every infidel you sent to a watery grave. 
 And more to come, as you ply your destructive trade for the Kingdom of Naples. 
 (Cheering) 
 A generous offer, no doubt, but I'm afraid too little too late. 
 Leonardo has been in my employ now for... considerable time. 
 And in many ways, he is more brother to me than aide. 
 (Laughs) 
 I will double whatever Lorenzo the Magnificent pays his "brother". 
 How dare you? 
 Hold, Alfonso. 
 You do not know how much Leonardo has lost. 
 We have all lost. 
 Yes. 
 But not something for which you have sought your entire life. 
 Leave him be. 
 Drink on, the day is ours. Drink on. 
 (Laughter) 
 Leo. 
 Leo. 
 Hey, come buy me a drink. 
 Hey. 
 You still don't know her fate. 
 You know...your mother may have survived. 
 So...you're saying to me... that my design failed? 
 That's not what I meant. 
 Well... then we do know her fate. 
 Leo... 
 I designed my weapon to destroy. Destroy. 
 That's exactly what it did. I mean in truth, in truth... the damn thing works even better than I could have hoped. 
 I mean, the cannons... they showed remarkable range. 
 The bombards, they kept their internal charge right up till the moment of impact. 
 Leo... 
 One minute, there's a flotilla, the next minute... just flotsam and jetsam. 
 Leo... 
 Come on, have a drink. 
 Have a drink. 
 No. 
 See you later. 
 I have done as asked... and have positioned myself in the Pontiff's good graces. 
 Has he agreed to lead the Crusade? 
 No, I have yet to broach the subject. 
 You must allow me to handle His Holiness in my own way. 
 His current state of agitation requires a certain delicacy. 
 Perhaps if I knew more of the Architect's plan... 
 Know your place, brother. 
 The Architect would never deign to meet a mere acolyte. 
 Is this indeed why you sought us out? 
 No. No, it is not. 
 Clarice Orsini is here in Rome... looking for you. 
 The Medici have their spies, as do we all. 
 Did you really think... you could wander Rome, spending her money... and she would not get wind of you? 
 I was ordered to plunder the coffers of Florence. 
 Plunder them I did. 
 I don't suppose you were ordered to plunder her body as well? 
 It is common knowledge you bedded the First Lady of Florence. 
 I can't imagine your orders entailed such a blunderous tactic. 
 My methods are my own. 
 You fool. 
 All that matters is we have the funds required. 
 I am a physician, a man of stature. 
 I have been seen with you in public. 
 If your spurned lover is hunting you, then she will find me. 
 I will resolve this. 
 Like you resolved Da Vinci? 
 You will remain here, keep to your duties. 
 I will resolve Signora de' Medici. 
 (Waves lapping on shore) 
 (Exhales) 
 (Distant explosions) 
 The remains of the Ottoman flagship have been smoldering for nearly 12 hours. 
 Just now, in a matter of minutes, the flames grew. 
 More significantly, the amount of smoke increased exponentially. 
 Perhaps you should get some sleep. 
 I have toyed with similar chemistry many times, haven't I? 
 Yes. 
 Different substances, when they're set ablaze, they can create a different class of smoke. 
 It can hug the ground, obscure the view for hours... sometimes days. 
 You give the Ottoman more credit than they deserve. 
 This chemistry sounds much too sophisticated for a horde of heathens. 
 These "heathens" defeated the Holy Roman Empire at Constantinople, the most heavily fortified city of its day. 
 I doubt that we have yet seen what they are truly capable of. 
 I do not much care whether they're praying to their gods or bedding their beasts of burden. 
 My fleet is due at sunrise. 
 They will all be cut to ribbons. 
 
 
 
 Daughter. 
 Come forth. 
 Sit. 
 You must be starved. 
 It's not poisoned, if that's what you fear. 
 Indeed. You prefer suicide missions to outright murder. 
 Ah, the dreaded time has come... when the dutiful child begets a defiant youth. 
 I haven't come here to defy you, Father. 
 I've come here for answers. 
 Daughter, please. 
 Sit. 
 Imprisoned for so many years, I do hate to waste a good meal. 
 So... 
 What news from Otranto? 
 You haven't heard? 
 I want to hear it from you. 
 Leonardo Da Vinci seems to have thwarted the invasion. 
 (He chuckles) 
 You're not perturbed by this? 
 The Ottoman Empire may have one or two surprises... for Signor Da Vinci. 
 How will their success bring you justice? 
 Justice, Daughter? 
 Your rightful place on the Papal throne. 
 The One True Pope - that's what you said. 
 You must understand, Daughter, the throne was always a means to an end. 
 The Sultan and his armies too - mere stepping stones. 
 Then why? Why is the invasion necessary? 
 We are like the farmer. 
 After harvesting the wheat, he uses fire to clear the field, burn the chaff. 
 Only then can a new crop take root. 
 And the Turks are your fire? 
 Soon the day will come... a world without popes... or sultans or kings. 
 Only the Sons of Mithras. 
 What are you saying? 
 The invasion is only the beginning. 
 Sadly, many must die. 
 Yet the Enlightened shall survive. 
 There is a place for you at my side, Daughter. 
 Rest by the fire. We shall speak more... upon the morning. 
 What is that? 
 Look, the smoke's clearing. 
 Look. 
 They've been busy. 
 They've built some form of wooden platform on the breakwater. 
 Yeah. 
 Block and tackle too. 
 Reminds me of the uh... thing in your studio. 
 That's for hauling marble statuary. 
 What would they be hauling? 
 I don't know. 
 Give me that. 
 Ah, Da Vinci. I'm pleased you will be here to bear witness. 
 Bear witness to what? 
 Our victory at Otranto. 
 On the horizon - the Grand Fleet of Naples. 
 Da Vinci : Some form of underwater explosive, tethered to the seabed. 
 (Explosions) 
 A detonation on impact. 
 How? 
 My God. 
 Sound the alarm! 
 The cannon, Da Vinci! 
 (Panicked shouts) 
 Get the muzzle! 
 You two, move! Turn it to the right! 
 Shoot now! 
 (Cannons boom) 
 Zo, Zo! 
 Light the balls. 
 Light it! 
 Bring it down! 
 Bring it down! Bring it down! 
 (Yells) 
 (Cannons firing) 
 Re-arm! 
 Re-arm! 
 How're they firing so fast? 
 I don't know. 
 (Indistinct shouting) 
 It's my cannon. 
 It's my cannon! It's the one I designed for you! 
 The city walls. 
 They're breaching the city walls! 
 Zo, Zo. Hey, hey, hey! 
 With me! 
 Soldier : Get inside now! 
 Come on! Come on! 
 (Coughs and splutters) 
 Ugh! 
 Swords! Swords! 
 I'll take two. 
 Long live Naples! 
 I can fix this. 
 (Grunts) 
 (Shell pounding) 
 (Shell pounding, soldiers roar) 
 (Roaring intensifies) 
 (Almighty roar) 
 Agh! 
 (Speaking foreign language) 
 Argh! 
 Fall back! 
 No. 
 Fall back! Fall back! 
 (Screaming) 
 (Screaming) 
 Urghh! 
 Agh! 
 Aargh! 
 (Yelling) 
 (Sobs) 
 So I have my answer. 
 I'm not betraying you, Father. 
 Indeed, you are not. 
 You are betraying her... your sister. 
 My dear, sweet Amelia... murdered by my monster of a brother. 
 That is what has made me what I am. 
 And you too, I can see. 
 I just need to go. 
 Before you depart, let me give you one more piece of fatherly wisdom. 
 Fatherly wisdom? 
 Beware the midway. 
 For that is the most dangerous path. 
 You would forsake your only daughter? 
 Give her time. 
 She will see the wisdom of her elders. 
 As will Da Vinci. 
 (Prays in Latin) 
 (Liquid dripping) 
 (Resumes praying) 
 (Dripping continues) 
 (Resumes praying) 
 (Dripping) 
 Deucalion : 'Cardinal Rodrigo?' 
 He was the Pontiff's right hand since the departure of Lupo Mercuri. 
 Who did this? 
 No one was seen or heard, yet I must concur with His Holiness. 
 The Prisoner wants his brother dead. 
 If he cannot get to him, he will get to those around him. 
 How could the Sons of Mithras infiltrate the Vatican? 
 I've doubled the guards on His Holiness - men I can trust. 
 Haven't you learned? 
 There are none we can truly trust. 
 I trust you, my brother. 
 How is the Pontiff taking this? 
 I've yet to tell him. 
 I fear his anxiety might overwhelm him. 
 Precisely his brother's plan, I presume. 
 Well, it's a chance we shall have to take. 
 Endanger the Pontiff? 
 Is that the plan? 
 The Cardinal's death provides an opportunity. 
 Sixtus will be frantic, terrified to the bone. 
 Now is your chance to embolden him. 
 He's right. No better time. 
 (Inhales sharply) 
 Are you... 
 Are you having doubts, Girolamo? 
 I confess I have suffered certain nightmares. 
 Remnants of the past. 
 Yeah. 
 You will learn, Girolamo. 
 On our great journey, our hardest-fought battles are with ourselves. 
 May I ask for more guidance? 
 (Grunts) 
 (Riario screams) 
 Aargh! 
 We're the horns of the increate. 
 We're the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth... 
 (Distant screams) 
 (Gasps) 
 (Zoroaster grunts and curses) 
 Zo, Zo! 
 (Zoroaster grunts and yells) 
 Zo... 
 Zo, it's over. It's over. It's over. 
 It's over. 
 (Sobs) 
 Shh, shh. 
 This is hell. 
 Shh, shh. 
 Otranto's fallen. 
 We have to get off the streets. 
 Yeah. 
 You alright? 
 I am. 
 (Grunts) 
 Psst! 
 Leonardo! In here! 
 Stand down. 
 This is Signor Da Vinci. 
 You're alive! 
 You could call it that. 
 (Da Vinci gasps and pants) 
 Water, rations. 
 Something stronger. 
 We must keep our wits about us if we are to survive. 
 That's a very large "if". 
 (Winces) 
 (Groans) 
 Father? 
 Leonardo, please. 
 Not now. 
 Lorenzo : I am a banker. 
 Money is my currency. 
 There is nothing that cannot be bought. 
 I say we make them an offer. 
 A ransom for the survivors, the remaining populace. 
 I mean... even godless infidels must have a price. 
 With all due respect, Lorenzo the Magnificent... you are in Naples now. 
 And in Naples, we do not stand idly by as our women are raped and murdered. 
 Or our men and boys sold into slavery, or our kings sent to an early grave. 
 You are out of your mind. 
 The only way to save lives is through negotiation. 
 I am truly sorry that you've lost your liege. 
 Sorry? 
 Alfonso the King of Naples is lying out there in pieces, being violated by all manner of infidel, I am sure. 
 Men of Naples... we must gather the troops and attack at first light. 
 I cannot allow this. 
 We must negotiate an acceptable peace. 
 Jesus Christ, you are both...f*cking insane. 
 (Grunts) 
 Seriously? 
 Did you not see what we saw? 
 Did you not just get the... sh1t, piss and f*cking tears... flogged out of you like we just did? 
 You can't stop them. 
 You can't pay them off. 
 We have to turn around, and we have to run. 
 No. Leonardo... 
 Leonardo, you can fix this. 
 No, listen. Leonardo... 
 Fix this? 
 I assure you, you... you would have more success asking the Turks to fix this than me. 
 Can't you see? 
 Can't you... (Winces) ..see... what it is that you are asking me to fix... who you are asking me to wage war against? 
 They have my cannons, they have my detonators, they have my explosives, they have my bombard fire. 
 I have no idea how... but somehow they have my weapons. 
 They have my work, they have my designs. 
 Holy hell. 
 What? 
 What's that? 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's that thing you designed, that monstrous armored cart. 
 (Soldiers yelling) 
 How... 
 We cannot stop that unholy thing. 
 We must retreat. 
 We can't just leave. 
 Watch us. 
 They're headed this way. 
 We cannot fight that monstrosity! 
 We must at least try. If we can stall its progress, then we could save hundreds of lives. 
 f*ck, they must have heard you. 
 (Man cries out) 
 That's good. 
 How the f*ck can that be good? 
 We can fight back. 
 I need liquor. 
 You and I both. 
 Barrels - barrels of liquor. Here, here, accelerant. 
 Stack them. Stack them up over here. 
 Now, angle the trajectory facing the Turks. 
 What the hell are you up to? 
 When they fire upon us, the impact- the impact from the bombard will ignite the contents of the barrels, which will create an intense backdraft that should stop them, stop them in their tracks. 
 Okay, here. 
 To me. To me. 
 Just get Leonardo whatever he needs. 
 Sshh. 
 (Grunting and straining) 
 Come on. On top of here. 
 That's it. 
 (Soldiers yelling) 
 Leo, time to go! 
 Everyone, take cover. 
 (Soldier shouts command) 
 You did it, Leonardo. 
 You did it! 
 (Coughs) 
 No. 
 We need to be sure. 
 Oh, my God. 
 (Rumbling and clanking) 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Leo! 
 Leo! 
 How can I fight... myself?
