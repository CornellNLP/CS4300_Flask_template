 Asterion : 'You have taken Da Vinci. Brother Carlo is making him one of us.' 
 You will become one, Da Vinci. 
 Da Vinci's death would not serve the Labyrinth. 
 His sacrifice would not be in vain. 
 At least the Sons of Mithras would not be able to use him against us. 
 'The invasion is only the beginning. Many must die.' 
 The Enlightened shall survive. 
 Da Vinci is a part of our wondrous vision. 
 I will design mechanisms of war, and you will pay me to construct. 
 We are still under the threat of an assassin in our midst. 
 Nico : 'The city is broke.' 
 The Council of One Hundred are my best customers. 
 Tell them. 
 You must take him back to Florence. He'll be safe there. 
 I will see you again. 
 But not before I have proved my worth.

 (Cart rattling) 
 Almost home. 
 Yes, Leo, you're right. 
 It is a beautiful day. Gorgeous, in fact. 
 The conversation, well, that's just...riveting. 
 Frankly, I don't know what I'd be doing if I wasn't saving your ass. 
 All right, Zo. I get it. 
 Thank you. 
 See? It wasn't so hard. 
 That's not wine. 
 No. 
 It's not even mead. 
 It's charcoal. 
 It's freshly crushed charcoal mixed with water. 
 I'm trying to flush the poisons from my body. 
 I should be able to perfect a serum once I have other... 
 What language is this? I've not seen it before. 
 It's cipher. 
 To stop your designs from being stolen. 
 The Labyrinth. Sons of Mithras. 
 (Sighs) They're everywhere. 
 I can't trust anyone. 
 Except me. 
 After days on the road... now there's a sight I didn't think I'd see again. 
 Whoa. 
 (Horse nickers) 
 (Low chatter) 
 Damn. 
 (Zoroaster sighs) 
 After everything that's happened, I'd forgotten how we left it. 
 (Door hinges creaking) 
 At least we've got enough kindling to last a while. 
 (Fluttering) 
 The supports will hold. 
 This is ridiculous. Leo. 
 You can't stay here. 
 I need to be in my studio. 
 (Sighs) 
 The city needs me. 
 This place is cursed, Leo. 
 Don't let it take you down with it. 
 After reinforcements arrive from Constantinople, my tanks will lead the invasion North. 
 The Janissary legions will follow close behind. 
 We move as one force through Naples, then into myriad elements, to surround Rome. 
 Italy will be under Ottoman rule before Rajab. 
 The end of your year. 
 You've not adjusted their pieces to counter your own. 
 The city states are too busy fighting amongst themselves to offer worthy opposition. 
 My brother...seeks to build alliances across Italy. 
 He's calling for a crusade. 
 Followers of the false prophet are no match for my Janissaries. 
 Or my arsenal. 
 You promised my father Da Vinci would join us. 
 He will. In time. 
 War waits for no man. 
 (Blade clinks) 
 He will die with the rest. 
 The fates will decide. Not you. 
 (Rattling) 
 (Clink) 
 Abandon your pledge, and it will be my steel that decides your fate. 
 Caterina the soothsayer. She speaks! 
 (Birds squawking) 
 (She groans) 
 Don't touch her! 
 We need privacy. Leave. At once! 
 (She moans) 
 Her skin is on fire. What do we do? 
 We wait. 
 (Panting) 
 (She gasps) 
 (Speaks demonic language) 
 The Page. 
 (Mutters and groans) 
 "She will find the Page from the Book of Leaves." 
 Who? 
 (Gasps) 
 The daughter. 
 (Thud) 
 Lucrezia. 
 We should have killed her when we had the chance. 
 (Rain pattering) 
 (Rattling as horse shakes head) 
 (Leaves crunching) 
 (Sighs) 
 Oh, Amelia. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I've wanted to come and see you so many times but... 
 (Sighs) 
 I'm here now. 
 (Whispers) I've been so frightened. 
 (Melancholy music) 
 But I owe you a great debt. 
 For even in my darkest hour, you... you've been there with me. 
 I heard your sweet laugh in the wind... and I smelt those flowers you loved to wear in your hair. 
 (Tearfully) And I felt your touch on my hand. 
 Then I... I've known that you're with me. 
 I won't leave you. 
 I'll stay with you. 
 Until night falls. 
 (Birdsong) 
 (Slow hoofbeats) 
 (Horse nickers) 
 (Horse whinnies) 
 Steady, boy. 
 (Knocking) 
 (Barking) 
 (She gasps) 
 Lucrezia. 
 (Dog growling) 
 Lupo Mercuri. 
 Your father... 
 Did he send you? 
 No. I came of my own volition. 
 I no longer serve any master. 
 Neither do I. 
 (Sighs) F... Forgive me. 
 My manners are an ill-effect of my solitude. 
 (He chuckles) 
 A butchered pig, if you'd care to join. 
 Come inside. You must be exhausted. 
 (Bell tolling) 
 Dragonetti : The rules have changed. 
 Zoroaster : Admit it. You've missed me. 
 Remain under my watch at all times within the Palace. 
 Understood? 
 Oh, that hurts, Captain. I thought we had something. 
 Never has this vaunted Palace been graced by such venal scum. 
 You're fortunate the Signorina has such questionable taste in her acquaintances. 
 Yes, I've heard you two had grown close. 
 (Sighs) 
 It's a desecration! 
 Stay. 
 A mockery. 
 I understand your concern. 
 If we allow Rome to parade around the Signora's remains, there will be no turning back. 
 Our citizens deserve to see what these monsters have done to the Mother of Florence. 
 And what about what she deserves? 
 Clarice Orsini will have a proper burial... after the Pageant of Arms has left Florence. 
 Allowing Rome to host the festivities here comes with a hefty deposit to our coffers. 
 Our morality is not for sale. 
 Without funds to feed our hungry, protect our children, pay our officers, chaos will rule the streets. 
 Then you and I will have a conversation about morality. 
 If your desire is for Florence to join the Crusade... 
 Aligning with Rome is not an option. 
 But profiting from them, that we must consider. 
 (Low chatter) 
 Man : Why are we even listening... 
 Going well, is it? 
 (Whispers) Zo! 
 I didn't think I'd see you again. 
 Oh, thank God you're home. 
 I can't imagine what you've been through. 
 You look... 
 Miserable. 
 Seasoned. 
 (Laughs) 
 The maestro is well? 
 In a manner of speaking. 
 (Debate continues in background) 
 Now, that is quite the sight. 
 (Laughs) 
 Our little Vanessa keeping those old f*cks in line. 
 She is amazing. 
 What are they debating? 
 Rome. 
 Always Rome. 
 Enough! 
 A decision has been made. 
 Continue your bickering elsewhere, if you must, but I am done listening. 
 (Murmuring) 
 You're a natural. 
 Zo. (Sighs) 
 (Zoroaster laughs) 
 By the skin of my teeth. 
 Where's Leo? 
 He's safe. 
 He's just... Everything that happened in Otranto, he blames himself, as though he personally carried out every atrocity in the city. 
 How could he possibly...? 
 'Cause he's Leonardo Da Vinci. 
 'Cause the world revolves around him. 
 Where is he? 
 Oh, he's in the ashes of his workshop, working on war machines for Sixtus. 
 Sixtus? The Leo I know would sooner sell his soul... 
 He's not the Leo we know. 
 It might be a while until we get him back. 
 (Crackling) 
 (Inhales) 
 The woman on the deck standing next to the Ottoman prince. 
 'That is your mother.' 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (Stifles a cough) 
 Woman : 'Think yourself a killer, Leonardo?' 
 (Whispering) 
 Think yourself a killer, Leonardo? 
 (Fading) 'Think yourself a killer, Leonardo?' 
 (Gasps) 
 But that is not what you are. 
 (Whispers) My son. 
 I thought...you were dead. 
 That's what they wanted you to believe. 
 They need you to hate them to wage this war. 
 You're not one of them? 
 (She exhales) 
 I was once. 
 (Softly) I'm sorry. This is all my fault. 
 I thought I was protecting you. 
 I wanted to believe him. I loved him. 
 I still do. 
 But I cannot abide by his methods. 
 Al-Rahim? 
 You and... You and he were together? 
 He is the reason I left your father. 
 (Distant tap) 
 (She gasps) 
 I will tell you everything. I promise. 
 But there's no time. 
 (Whispers) What? 
 They will be coming for her. The one you loved. 
 (Whispers) Lucrezia. 
 She seeks the missing Page from the Book of Leaves. 
 Oh. 
 The Book. 
 (Sighs) 
 I found the book, Leonardo. 
 And I saw what it was capable of. 
 You must not allow the Page to fall into the wrong hands. 
 Even a single page from the Book... holds potential for great destruction. 
 Oh, you... 
 You want me to... wield it? 
 (Sighs) 
 No. 
 No. 
 This is a trick. 
 Please. You must listen. 
 No. 
 There is a girl with Lucrezia. Sophia. 
 You must find the Page and protect them both from those that seek it. 
 No. 
 This is... 
 This is one of his... mind games. 
 Are you here to steal more of my designs, Al-Rahim? 
 Huh? 
 'Cause you are wasting your time! 
 Just get out of my f*cking head! 
 Get out! 
 My father, that we so willingly followed, is not the man that we thought he was. 
 Mm. 
 Both of us were manipulated. 
 Our loyalty exploited by those we trusted most. 
 That's why I came back here. 
 To seek answers of my own. 
 Tell me, why are you here? 
 I'm searching for something. 
 Something that can be of use to a friend of mine. 
 Something here? (Chuckles softly) 
 When you were steward at the Secret Archives... there was a page in the collection... from the Book of Leaves. Do you remember it? 
 Would you like some more pig? 
 And then, when you left for Rome, the Page went missing. 
 I assume that wasn't coincidence. 
 Why do you seek this page? 
 Because some believe it holds great power. 
 And if it does, then perhaps we can use it against the Ottoman invasion. 
 You wish to become Italy's protector? 
 (Laughs) 
 My father's lies brought the Turks to our shores. 
 And...I share in that responsibility. 
 So...I seek to make amends. 
 Hm. 
 You must be tired. You should get some sleep. 
 The Page? 
 Do you have it? 
 We'll discuss this more once you've rested. 
 I'll make up a bed for you. 
 (Paper rustling) 
 Hm. 
 Oh, what manner of beast are you? 
 (Gasps softly) 
 (He groans) 
 Yargh! 
 Leo. 
 I brought Nico. 
 Vanessa had the baby. 
 She wants to see you. 
 Yeah, he's fat and happy. 
 If I didn't know better, I'd say he was half Vespucci. 
 (Dramatic music) 
 Zoroaster : What's he doing with that torch? 
 No! 
 (Grunting) 
 What the...? 
 (Steam hissing) 
 What the f*ck did you do that for? 
 Now I have no idea how long it will last. 
 (Groans) 
 How long what will last? 
 The flame-retardant mud. 
 Another moment and you would have been roasted. 
 Look at your arm. 
 (Sighs) 
 sh1t. 
 If we're to reach the tanks, it has to last mu longer than this. 
 The tanks? 
 Mm. Armored gun carriage. 
 The Turks used them at Otranto. 
 Couldn't you design something similar? 
 I have a lot of work to do. 
 So...you should go. 
 What? So you can work on weapons for Sixtus? 
 How can you align with him after everything he's done? 
 There's more to it than you know. 
 Maybe tell us what's going on. We can help. 
 All right. 
 My designs... my plans, were ripped from my head. 
 They were used against me and those I love. 
 People died... because of what I know. 
 Leo. 
 So I can't share my intentions, less I endanger you as well. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's good to see you. 
 Truly it is. 
 But you must leave. 
 Just go! Go! 
 Pay Vanessa a visit. 
 Meet the heir. 
 Might do you some good. 
 (Woman shrieks and whimpers) 
 (Whimper in background) 
 (Insects buzzing) 
 (Woman shrieks) 
 (Fire crackling) 
 (Owl hoots) 
 (Horse neighs) 
 (Footsteps clomp on bridge) 
 (She breathes nervously) 
 (Woman muttering) 
 Hello? 
 (Gasps) 
 (Whispers) Oh, God. 
 Help us! 
 Please. 
 Please... Please don't... 
 Wait. 
 Hurry. 
 (Rattling) 
 (Gasps) 
 (Lucrezia groans) 
 (Grate thudding) 
 Please help us. 
 He'll be back soon! Please hurry! 
 Get us out of here! 
 Please! 
 He'll be back! Hurry! 
 (Whimpering) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Don't worry. I'll get you out of there. 
 (She gasps and body thuds) 
 (Lucrezia groaning) 
 You should not have come. 
 The Page is mine, Lucrezia. 
 (Birds chirping) 
 You are having second thoughts. 
 What if we've been too bold in our thinking? 
 If we're unable to sway Florence to our Holy Crusade... 
 We will turn the tide in our favor. 
 Of that I'm convinced. 
 If I didn't know better, I'd say you were humoring me. 
 How dare you accuse me, Signora, of such a peaceable disposition. 
 You're worried about Florence's new regime. 
 Florence is led by children. 
 Disciples of Da Vinci, no less. 
 He will do our convincing for us. 
 Without Florence by our side, the foundations of our Crusade could crumble. 
 And this trip will end in disaster. 
 Have a little faith, Signora. 
 
 
 
 (Bells ringing in distance) 
 (Horses whinnying and snorting) 
 (Low chatter) 
 Signora Moschella. 
 Lord Girolamo Riario, Count and Captain General of the Holy Roman Church. 
 And may I introduce Signora Cereta of Venice. 
 My partner in this endeavor. 
 It's an honor to meet the new Mother of Florence. 
 Albeit under such grim circumstances. 
 You're an emissary from Venice? 
 Do you not have a treaty with the Ottoman Empire? 
 One we are willing to dissolve in honor of our fallen countrymen. 
 One of the many things I wish to discuss with you. 
 May we walk for a moment? 
 Does this one always lurk over your shoulder? 
 Give us a moment, would you? I'll be fine. 
 Thank you, Captain. 
 You've done well for yourself. 
 Could say the same. 
 It is not as it appears. 
 She will not be easily swayed by arguments to join the Crusade. 
 Even if that argument comes from you? 
 Hosting your festival helps alleviate some financial burdens, but that is the extent of our interest. 
 Neither Vanessa nor I favor an alliance with Rome. 
 The incentives don't end with the festival. 
 The Crusade can save Florence. 
 In more ways than one. 
 All these men were executed? 
 Over 800. 
 Each beheaded in the name of our Lord and Savior because they would not convert to Islam, with not only Alfonso of Naples defending the city, but your own Lorenzo the Magnificent. 
 Rarely have two great warriors been overcome so severely. 
 I trust now you see how dire our situation is. 
 No doubt the threat is extreme. 
 But aligning with Sixtus is not something we can consider lightly. 
 My faith in the Holy Father has also been... slow to develop. 
 But we have a mutual enemy. 
 Our very existence is on the line. 
 Lorenzo... 
 He's really dead? 
 The bones are merely replicas. 
 I'm afraid we were unable to recover his body. 
 (Footsteps crunching) 
 (Angry muttering) 
 Filthy garbage! 
 (Man grunts) 
 There's another one over there. 
 (Muttering) 
 Man : Guards! Okay behind the rock! 
 (Panting) 
 Your daughter said that the true Pope was being held prisoner in the Vatican. 
 I assumed it was another of her lies. 
 Captivity was not my destiny. 
 Nor is it yours, Lorenzo de'Medici. 
 Your Ottoman allies appear to disagree. 
 Everything that has happened... everything that will happen, was foretold by a man we all once knew... and loved. 
 You must be Da Vinci's mysterious Turk. 
 And you are the grandson of Cosimo de'Medici. 
 This invasion was a part of his grand plan. 
 My grandfather never had a taste for such savagery. 
 Without this...sacrifice... there can be no enlightenment. 
 (Lorenzo scoffs) 
 What enlightenment? 
 I see only the dead, whom we burn to make room for more. 
 Perhaps you confuse the path with the destination. 
 Your place is with us, Lorenzo. 
 You were born to rule. 
 Be a king to these savages? 
 A ruler to murderers and rapists, is that what you suggest? 
 Cower with you behind these heathens... who execute pious men, and bathe in the blood of innocent children? 
 These savages are merely a tool we wield. 
 A blade to cut, a scythe to cull. 
 When a tool outlives its usefulness... it is discarded. 
 A second flood is coming. 
 All you love will be washed away, unless you open your eyes and allow yourself to be reborn as a true Son of Mithras. 
 (Dramatic music) 
 I would sooner drown. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 (Timber creaking) 
 (Bird fluttering) 
 (Blade clinks) 
 Afternoon. 
 What's this? 
 The last time we were together... I was attacked and tortured. 
 You don't remember? 
 We were tracking Carlo de'Medici and his Labyrinth brethren. 
 They must have laid a trap for us at the Medici Bathhouse. 
 I was struck from behind. 
 When I awoke, you were gone. 
 My men found you, days later, in the tunnels beneath Rome. 
 And I said nothing when I was found? 
 Frankly, I am surprised to see you in such robust form. 
 (Sighing) 
 The Labyrinth. 
 They were behind it all. 
 They killed Rodrigo, Clarice... tried to condition me. 
 We will avenge their deaths and make them pay for what they did to you. 
 Until then, I can only offer this as solace. 
 (Rattling) 
 Sixtus agreed. He's funding my work? 
 His Holiness understands that if the Crusade is to stand a chance against the infidels, he needs your help. 
 We've summoned the leaders of the city states to Florence. 
 We must convince them to put aside their differences and join the Crusade. 
 A demonstration from you could seal their allegiance. 
 Mm. 
 Well, then they shall have one. 
 (Birds squawking) 
 (Metallic scraping) 
 I told you he would not listen. 
 Lorenzo is a stubborn man. 
 But then...so was his grandfather. 
 (Sighs) 
 He'll come around. 
 If he doesn't, my men will flatten his city on our way to Rome. 
 Why do you fight for the Ottomans? 
 I know you were not born of their ranks. 
 Your deftness with language betrays you. 
 I was a prisoner, like your precious Il Magnifico. 
 My brother and I were taken as children. 
 You were slaves? 
 Until I found Allah. 
 He gave my life meaning when I had none. 
 And now you kill all those who refuse him. 
 As your people do in the name of their god. 
 Despite what you may think, we are not savages. 
 I was educated at... (Speaks Persian) ..as were most of my men. 
 We are philosophers and artisans who kill for the Sultan, not for glory... but because your Holy Father paraded his son around Rome like an animal. 
 To insult him, is to insult all of Islam. 
 (Ship's timbers creaking) 
 That is my purpose here. 
 Yours I've yet to grasp. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 (Bell tolling) 
 (Horse whinnying) 
 What grand mission of state are you on this fine day? 
 The Pleasure Palace. They're late on their taxes. 
 Oh, they're paying you in fellatio? 
 Zo, we're broke. 
 (Hushed conversation) 
 What, you and Vanessa? 
 Florence. 
 Carlo de'Medici stole 500,000 florins. There's nothing left. 
 Holy f*ck. 
 If I don't find a new source of income, we'll be forced to join the Crusade. 
 What? And taxing Singh's the answer? 
 Not just her. 
 Collecting restitution from all illegal activities in the city. 
 Well, if you think you can just walk into Singh's and rob her blind, you don't know who you're dealing with. 
 Oh, I'm well acquainted. 
 Sorry? You talked with Singh on your own? 
 I am the highest advisor to the Medici family in Florence. 
 What did she do to you? 
 Not the donkey kick. You can still walk. 
 It's not important. 
 The woman with the man parts? 
 Enough. 
 Ah, the golden shower. 
 (Laughs) Sorry, Nico, but you're going about this all wrong. 
 That f*ck palace is a bottomless treasure chest, but you have to work with her if you want a piece of it. 
 I tried. She refused. 
 Well, let me talk to her. We're old friends. 
 (Grunting) 
 (Groaning) 
 We have a proposition for you. 
 Yes, I'm sure you do. 
 Let go of him. 
 Now. 
 Well...if it isn't everyone's favorite piss pot. 
 Back for more? Or are you here to pay off his debt? 
 I'm here to collect yours. 
 And I've brought the Officers of the Night with me to ensure your cooperation. 
 Are you threatening me, boy? 
 It's no threat. 
 Signor Machiavelli has the one thing you lack. 
 Real power. 
 (Groans) 
 Thank you, darling. 
 Well? 
 I thought you had a proposition for me. 
 Yeah. Let him tax your establishment. Share in your profits. 
 And in return? 
 In return... he will share his power. 
 He'll give you a seat on the council. 
 And you'll be a true noblewoman. 
 (Owl hoots) 
 How long have you been here? 
 (Soft muttering) 
 I'm not sure. A fortnight? 
 It's hard to know. 
 (Groans) 
 The only way out is above us. 
 (Muttering continues) 
 You're not from the convent? 
 No. 
 San Cosimato. 
 How did you get here? 
 He came late at night. 
 Said we were in danger. 
 That we need to escape. 
 A cardinal from the Vatican. Of course we believed him. 
 There were four of us. 
 Lupo's gone mad. 
 You know him? 
 I used to. I... 
 It's... He wasn't this man. 
 What does he want from you? 
 Each night...at moonrise, he takes one of us. 
 If we refuse, he sets the dog on us. 
 She's not been the same since the first night. 
 He's insanely obsessed, but with what? 
 What does he think that you know? 
 He spoke of a book. 
 The pages change each time your eyes look upon it. 
 He says one of us can translate it. 
 The Book of Leaves. He thinks you can read from the Page. 
 There's a library... 
 (Squeak) 
 (She prays in Latin) 
 Lupo. 
 Lupo, you don't have to do this. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Let the girls go, and you and I... we can learn from the Page. 
 We cannot. 
 Only those born with the gift can read the Page. 
 And one of these girls has it. 
 How do you know? 
 The Page told me. 
 (Barking) 
 Put on the chains, or I'll send in the dog. 
 No! No, don't! No, don't do it! 
 Don't! You don't have to do this! 
 Put on the chains! 
 Lupo! 
 Lupo! 
 No! No! No! 
 (Sobbing) 
 I'm here. I'm here. 
 Shh. 
 (Grate squeaks and clangs) 
 (Low chatter) 
 This better be good.! 
 You'll need to hustle if you're to collect it all. 
 Man  (in background): I've seen better. 
 (Leo sighs) 
 You want to leave? Yes? 
 Here's your opportunity. 
 Take it. 
 (Rattling) 
 (Chatter in background) 
 What the hell are you making? 
 Keep your movements random. 
 Can't have anyone tracking the materials I'm using. 
 No. 
 Shall I wear a disguise? 
 Hm? 
 Little dress, perhaps? 
 Just hurry. 
 I need everything by tonight. 
 Is it true? 
 You uh... 
 You intend to stand against the Crusade? 
 We will not trade one invasion for another. 
 The Republic of Florence has been protecting itself without Rome's assistance for nearly 400 years, and I see no reason to change that policy. 
 Mm. Well, I think you underestimate the cost of outfitting an army... and the reality of the Ottoman threat. 
 Just as you underestimate me. 
 I may be new to my position, but I am not naive. 
 Your um... Your city is bankrupt, Signorina. 
 And I assure you the Turks will rain fire on Florence on their timetable, not yours. 
 Do not forget history's lessons, my dear. 
 The city of Bursa shared your pride and suffered greatly for it. 
 Florence is not Bursa. 
 Surely not. 
 Bursa had the strongest military, the highest walls. 
 They, too, went it alone against the infidel. 
 A hundred years ago. 
 Dragonetti. 
 They closed off every trade route, stopped supplies from entering the city, then simply waited. 
 The city starved, withered away. 
 And years later... when there was no-one left to fight, the enemy simply walked through their gates. 
 Nor can we simply let Rome walk through ours. 
 Exactly what will happen if we join their Crusade. 
 We will not hand over the keys to our kingdom. 
 Not to the Turks, not to Rome, not to anyone. 
 (Men muttering) 
 Our Republic has protected itself without the aid of Rome... 
 (Softly) There was a time... 
 I thought history would revere the name Machiavelli. 
 But now... now I see you have let beauty cloud all judgment with no less than the future of Italy at stake. 
 My influence is not as strong as you imagine. 
 Neither is your beloved Republic. 
 Are you blind? 
 You are only as strong as Da Vinci, and he is aligned with Rome. 
 Break it, you buy it. 
 (Birds chirping) 
 Not the best representation of a moving tank, is it? 
 It's not movement I'm worried about. That's simple geometry. 
 It's penetrating the armor. That's the real trick. 
 Now, their breastplates are made from the same impenetrable metal as their tanks. 
 Zo. 
 When I mix the catalyst and agent, we will only have seconds to load and shoot before the glass dissolves. 
 What happens when it dissolves? 
 Well, when the warhead shatters, contact with the air should ignite the mixture, which should disintegrate the armor, as though covered in molten rock. 
 (Exhales) You ready? 
 Mm. 
 Good. 
 (Bubbling and fizzing) 
 (Panting) 
 Load it! 
 Jesus. 
 The glass is melting. Hurry up. 
 Light it! 
 Quick! 
 Trying! (Groans) 
 (Fuse fizzing) 
 (Explosion) 
 (Birds chattering) 
 (Zoroaster laughs) 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Somebody tell Hades he's out of a job. 
 Mm. 
 It's not even dented. (Sighs) 
 How is that even possible? 
 Your rocket hit the target. Your explosives worked. 
 Clearly they didn't. Oh, f*ck it. 
 Wait. Wait. 
 There's something here. 
 (Whispers) Oh. Argh. f*ck. 
 What? 
 Here. Look. 
 (Sighs) What? 
 See it? 
 It's a maker's mark. 
 Some kind of emblem... just under the surface. 
 (Laughs) Oh, f*ck me. 
 What? 
 Don't tell me you don't remember our little jaunt to Wallachia. 
 The Order of the Dragon? 
 One... Turkish sultani gold coin. 
 Stamped on the back. 
 You stole this from Vlad the Impaler? (Laughs) 
 Maybe he has something to do with this indestructible armor. 
 (Metallic tapping) 
 Well, there's one way to find out. 
 We'll be in and out before he knows we're there. 
 What? No. No way. Absolutely not. 
 I'm not going back there, dead or not dead. 
 I need to examine this further. 
 Meet me in my workshop first thing in the morning. 
 I'm gonna need a raise. 
 Leo? 
 (Wood creaking) 
 (Groaning) 
 Oh! 
 (Whispers) Damn it. 
 What could he be doing to her? 
 Oh...I don't know. 
 The Cardinal that I knew, he would never do this. 
 His mind has been corrupted by this obsession. 
 You think the Book has driven him insane? 
 I can't see any other cause for it. 
 I will get you out of here. 
 (Whispers) I swear. 
 I will get us both out of here. 
 (Squeak and dull thud) 
 Lupo? 
 Lupo? 
 (Thud) 
 (Whimpering) 
 We should have sent for Da Vinci. 
 This is no way for the Regent of Florence to travel. 
 I've walked these streets a thousand times. 
 I refuse to let a title shackle me to the Palace. 
 (Knocking) 
 (Knocking continues) 
 Oh, f*ck's sake! 
 What? 
 What? 
 (Door hinges creaking) 
 Vanessa. 
 It's wonderful to see you. But now's not the time. 
 Your friends are scared. You haven't been yourself. 
 They don't know if they should trust you any more. 
 They don't trust me? 
 You're working for Sixtus. 
 Leo...he's using you. 
 No. 
 No. 
 I'm using him. 
 (He breathes heavily) 
 It's the only way that we can defeat the Turks. 
 Ah, and when you've won, Sixtus will turn those weapons on Florence. 
 No. I'll stop him. 
 How? 
 I don't know. I... I'll figure it out. 
 Leo, you can't do this on your own. 
 Stop pushing us away. 
 Everything I do... 
 Everything I've done... it's for Florence. 
 It's for you and... and Nico... and Zo and your baby. 
 You're all I have left of my family. 
 They've taken everyone else. 
 They've killed my father, imprisoned my mother. 
 I can't risk... any of you getting hurt. 
 I've lost so much. 
 I can't bear to lose you, too. 
 (Whispers) No. 
 No, you're not alone, Leo. 
 We can help. 
 Please let us help you. 
 What's his name? 
 The baby. 
 Giulio. 
 Giulio. 
 Oh... 
 (She whimpers) 
 (He sniffles) 
 (Door hinges creaking) 
 (Bell tolling in distance) 
 Dragonetti? 
 (Gasps) 
 (Blood pattering onto street) 
 (Vanessa shrieks) 
 Hey. 
 Hey, shh. Shh-shh. 
 (Clattering nearby) 
 He's here. 
 Get back inside, Vanessa! 
 (Tile clatters) 
 (Grunting) 
 Yargh! 
 (Groaning) 
 (Groaning) 
 (Instrumental music)
