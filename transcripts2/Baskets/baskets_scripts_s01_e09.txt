That's what you want: Play in his band. You a musician? I'm so sorry. I don't understand what you mean. I'm not my father. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know anything about your father. My father. You're holding his record. This your father? This guy? Yes. I don't know anything about that guy. Who cares about that guy? I came to talk to you.

 Right here, yep. You probably don't know who I am, huh? Uh, that's not true. You're the dad, right? I will tell you who I am. I am a man who had a talent, yes, and with that talent I was smart. I worked very hard. I made money with what I was good at for my children. Do you understand, Chip,  Le clown? You understand? Yes, sir, thank you. Yes. Nice. Now, uh, let me ask you this. My daughter... You think my daughter, she... she... she has talent? I think your daughter is the most talented person I've ever met. I agree with you. But the problem, she does nothing with it. Um, example. I make an appointment to have an arrangement and recording. No way. She does not show up. I offer her to sing with my band. Sorry. He is always to egotistic, you know? Heavy. Don't you feel nauseated by his discussion? My French is not as strong, so I didn't pick up on a lot of the last part of all that stuff. We were speaking English, but, uh... It's my fault. I should not have helped you. Now you never know what it means to work hard. You go around with your guitar, but you know that I pay for your house, for your clothing, and for your dinner. Huh? This is not real. You're not a bohemian. You're a  touriste. A  touriste de la ville. You're like a little lion raised in a... in a zoo. You can't go in the jungle. You have no idea what's out there. You will always run back to the zookeeper, to Dada. Non mais ... Ça va merde! C'est pas possible. C'est pas possible. Is this, uh, French roast? [Slurp] Good evening. Next. Yes, I'm looking for a French baguette. We don't do French baguettes. We do hoagies. Do you want a hoagie bread? Uh... 6-inch or foot-long? Which one is longer? Well, the 6-inch is like this, and the foot-long is like... Oh, yeah. Double in size. That makes sense. And then we have our 6-foot party hoagie. Oh. Okay, uh, can I get 2 feet of that, please? 2 feet? Yeah, 2 feet of the party hoagie, please. Uh, you have to get all 6 feet, sir. Well, maybe you just give me 2 feet of it, and you can have the rest of the 4 feet. I'm not allowed to take gifts from clients. [Sigh] And I already have two strikes. Okay, fine. Just give me the least complicated sub, a ham sub. 6-foot ham sandwich. Okay, that comes with a squirt. What do you mean, comes with a squirt? We have the Italian squirt, the jalapeño squirt, the Parmesan oregano squirt, the roasted garlic squirt, the limited time yellow squirt, limited time seasonal pumpkin squirt, lo-Cal squirt, soy squirt, or our secret surprise squirt. [Sigh] I'll try the limited time yellow squirt, please. That's nice. Can I get a pound and a half of that, please? Sir, can we give him a pound and a half of the yellow squirt? Oh, I thought that was going to be my third strike. Where's my food? I need a, uh, cheap... Ring for... Engagement to... Wedding. Sir, your carrot. Oh, thank you, yes. Wonderful. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something, and I think it's... [Sigh] Oh, no, no. No, Chips. Oh, please, no. Oh, it is so embarrassing. Will you marry me? Ohh. Just marry me, please. You and I can have a wonderful life. If you'll go back with me and marry me, you'll make me the happiest man in... in... Back where? Bakersfield, California. Okay. I'll marry you. Okay, look. You must understand I don't love you, but, uh, I want to get out. I want to go to America and get green card, you know? Are you okay with that? Then I come. Thank you. You've made me so happy. [Chuckling] Should we have a... Maybe a romantic kiss or anything like that? A what? A romantic kiss. No, maybe not. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just wait. Good idea. So thank you for the... For the ring. Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I wish I could kiss you, but we'll wait. You're so happy. [Chuckling] It's cute. Should we go get something to eat for you? You didn't have anything. I had a carrot. It's fine. Oh, I take you to a nice place, okay? Okay. Yes. This is a mistake, you know. What do you mean? It's just goat cheese and bread. It's good. No, the marriage is a bad mistake. Uh... What? I mean... I know why I'm doing this. Do you know? I want paper for America, you know? But you, uh, what exactly do you want? What do you mean? Because I love you. I know you're head over heel in love with me, but it's a bad beginning. And bad beginning always have bad ending. ♪♪ I know about bad beginnings. My brother, his umbilical cord was wrapped around my neck when we were born. You know what I mean? My dad... He slipped and fell off a bridge, and he died. It made my mom really sad. You know. It's probably why I became a clown. I was trying to cheer her up... Dancing around, you know, so she wouldn't cry all the time. I'm not worried about this bad beginning because this bad beginning, look at it. I'm sitting in Paris with the most beautiful woman in the world... Who just told me she would marry me. I'm going to disappoint you, Chips. This is good bread. This is really good bread. Martha : Hey, Chip. Are you hungry? I got some food: Nuggets and fries. Yeah, I'll have a fry. I asked for waffle fries, but they look like criss-cut. Probably the same thing, maybe. Well, not if you know fries. You know fries, huh? Room d's in v-tach. Um, page Dr. Rhines for me. Calling code. That's my mom's room. Code blue, ccud. I need a crash cart! Mom! [Nurse shouting] [Monitor beeps, flatlines]
