 Previously on Allegiance... 
 These are files that were on Mikhail's computer. 
 If it's real, then we need to take this to the FBI. 
 They have a mole inside the US government. 
 The Treasury maintains a database to track suspicious money transfers. 
 That's for law enforcement agencies only. 
 CIA doesn't have access. 
 But your task force is full of FBI agents. 
 I won't steal an FBI agent's access code. 
 Katya : Alex, stealing the code is what the operation requires. 
 Special Agent Faber. 
 Have you ever spied on your country, Alex? 
 No, never. 
 Mark : The money from Tolliver's bank is going to Rome in three days. 
 We needed to figure out a way to get you there. 
 Why are you looking at me like that? 
 [men grunt] 
 [gunshots] 
 Sam : The good news is, Intel is matching up to known SVR officers. 
 We seem to have a Russian Easter egg on our hands. 
 [retching] 
 Where is the Triggerman now? 
 He's on the move. 
 Now, Alex, this man is highly, highly trained. 
 You're not gonna be able to stand up in about ten minutes. 
 You got to let it go. 
 There's too much at stake. 
 Alex. Hey, did you make it back okay? 
 Michelle said you didn't answer her texts. 
 [gunshots] 
 Alex : He was escorting his own cutout. 
 I let him get away. Fadi's dead. 
 I screwed up everything. 
 [engine roaring] 
 What do you see? 
 Darkness. 
 I'm sorry, what exactly do have to be so melancholy about right now? 
 The operation was a success, and you got some. 
 Okay, wipe that grin off your face before James Bond back there catches on. 
 Sam : Just got off with Brock. 
 Going through the data on that drive is like drinking from a fire hose. 
 Did you find anything? 
 A few midlevel SVR assets. 
 Nothing on Black Dagger. 
 It'll take 1,000 man hours to sift through it all. 
 But we did well yesterday. 
 To small victories. 
 [glasses clink] 
 So what's your secret, Alex? 
 What do you mean? 
 Last night, you were puking out your lower intestine. 
 Today you look like you could go 12 rounds. 
 I... sleep, I guess. 
 Amazing, isn't it, what a good night's rest can do? 
 Well, the science backs it up. 
 Okay, you're weird. 
 That the science backs up that sleep helps... 
 No. 
 Then why? 
 Alex, I'm messing with you. 
 If the last thing I do, I'm going to teach you how to recognize when that is happening. 
 Speaking of sleep, I want to, so please shut up. 
 Princess needs her beauty rest. 
 Wrong finger. 
 You're blind. Your eyes are closed. 
 How is it that you're employed by the same organization that tracked down bin Laden? 
 Jealous? 
 I will pay you to let me sleep right now. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 You sink this, and I'll be quiet the entire rest of the trip. 
 I will hold you to that. 
 No, no, no, not that one. 
 That one. 
 All right, then you say out loud that the FBI is a superior organization to the CIA. 
 Done. 
 Wow. 
 Say it, and reflect on your sins in silence. 
 Is this what you meant when you said don't get into a game of quarters with her?

 Alex : Fadi took this picture before... before he was killed by this man. 
 Alex : Any of you recognize him? 
 No. 
 Alex : We have to assume this is the person that's gonna carry out Black Dagger. 
 I need to alert the task force. 
 And tell them what? 
 That you snuck away from a covert CIA operation to follow a suspected terrorist on your own? 
 And all you have is a blurry photo that could be anybody to show for it? 
 You can tell height, weight, skin tone, age within 20 years. 
 Alex : That's something. 
 The Rezident has a mole somewhere with exceptional access to CIA and FBI intelligence. 
 If you tell anyone even this, the SVR will find out and kill you. 
 He's right, Alex. 
 Natalie : We need a name. 
 We need something they can follow up on and verify. 
 There is an imminent attack. 
 We can't just stand around talking. 
 We won't. 
 We'll get a name. 
 How? 
 This man is a ghost. 
 That's why the SVR hired him. 
 Well, then the SVR knows who he is. 
 The Rezident knows. 
 Maybe if I ask him, he'll tell me. 
 Try that. See how it goes. 
 If we got listening devices in his office... 
 We? You mean me. 
 Of course. 
 Bugging an SVR rezident is out of reach for anyone but an insider. 
 We get a bug in the Rezident's office. 
 Then we lead him to believe the CIA caught on to Black Dagger in some way. 
 If we're lucky, he contacts the Triggerman. 
 You have to sign in at the guard desk to even get access to the area with the file vault and the Rezident's office. 
 They do an electronic sweep every other day. 
 If it gets discovered, I will be on a very short list of suspects. 
 The electronic sweep won't detect anything if there's no electronics to detect. 
 What? 
 I can modify the bug to experience a power surge 24 hours after you plant it. 
 The surge fries the electronics. Voila, undetectable. 
 MIT. 
 We'll need to bug his car as well. 
 Faber : Got your message. Come on, you're buying. 
 Rain check. Got to be back in four hours. 
 I remember the days we used to drink all night and still make the turnaround. 
 Remember that? 
 Yeah, long time ago. 
 Yeah, so what did you want to talk about? 
 This is off the record. 
 I'm just looking for some advice right now. 
 Okay. 
 Well, you know I spent most of my career looking outside the agency for bad guys, people who were dirty, weak, ripe to turn. 
 Objectively speaking, I'm good at spotting them. 
 Agreed. 
 Hate to admit it, but agreed. 
 But I've never had to look inside at my own people. 
 Never had a reason. 
 Theoretically speaking, what am I supposed to look for to spot someone who might be working for the other side? 
 Think of it like a cheating spouse. 
 It's the little things you can't put your finger on. 
 White lies, half truths, unexplained absences, an inflection in the voice, hyper-protest of innocence. 
 Human beings out to deceive have the same tells. 
 Who? 
 It's not important right now. 
 Yeah, so it's the boy genius you took under your wing. 
 Alex O'Connor. 
 Very nice, Faber. Very nice. 
 Objectively speaking, I'm pretty good at my job. 
 I got a weird feeling about this, Jason. 
 Feelings aren't facts, Sam. 
 You start pointing fingers. You get it wrong. 
 You might burn down a promising career before it gets off the ground. 
 All right, well, this is an off-the-record conversation. 
 What do you think? 
 Honestly, based on what I saw and what you told me about him, I don't think someone whose mind works as differently as O'Connor's could hold it together as a double agent. 
 Now, that said, you should keep an eye on him. 
 Does something else unexplained. 
 Maybe we get a surveillance order. 
 Dig deeper on him. 
 [sighs] 
 All right, thanks, Jay. 
 I owe you one. 
 Last one. 
 When we lost contact with you in Rome, as awful as the thought was of losing you, I felt something else. 
 Pride. 
 Going after that operative by yourself, that was brave, Alex. 
 I wish I could tell you this was all gonna be over soon, but bugging the Rezident is daunting. 
 We need a backup plan. 
 In case he kills us all? 
 Natalie. 
 It's the truth, Dad. 
 Alex is a part of all this now. 
 He needs to confront what it really is. 
 Somehow we need to alert the task force that the operative in charge of Black Dagger is on his way here. 
 It just can't come from you, not directly. 
 Victor is right. 
 The mole would come after you. 
 Natalie : Dad and I have an idea. 
 We plant a letter for the task force to find in the SVR cache that we created that you recovered in Italy. 
 A letter ordering the Rezident to help prepare for the arrival of the operative in New York to carry out Black Dagger. 
 In order to add to the cache, I'd need to have unfettered access to the FBI server. 
 You still have your partner Michelle's log-in codes, right? 
 All right. 
 It'll take me a day to create a document that will bed-in well enough with what we already created. 
 I'll text you. 
 Hey, do you know who those people are? 
 Michelle : Computer analysis response team. 
 They arrived overnight. 
 They've combed through 5% of the SVR cache so far. 
 Anything about Black Dagger? 
 Not yet. 
 Hey, I'm thinking I need a change of scenery. 
 Too long in one place, my mind shuts down. 
 What time did you get in this morning? 
 Half hour ago. 
 We can't do anything until the computer team finishes their search anyway. 
 Let's go work at my place. 
 We'll be more productive. 
 How would it be more productive? 
 Anything we can do there, we can do here. 
 Not everything, Alex. 
 Michelle : I told you we'd get more done here. 
 You're so beautiful. 
 We have a leak inside SVR. 
 I don't have all the details, but the Americans got their hands on a data cache... 
 [speaking indistinctly] 
 No. 
 Information stolen was only moderately sensitive, though the cover of several of our diplomatic officers was blown. 
 Oh. 
 No one important. 
 Here's the latest, but this feels like an overture from one of our operatives to the Americans. 
 The way of establishing he has real information in exchange for immunity. 
 Never mind. I will do it myself. 
 Tim... 
 That was a good night. 
 Grocery bags in our boots so the dogs lost our scent. 
 But you were the best in our class, Dmitri. 
 The big man. 
 Now I drive the big man. 
 And I admire your self-control. 
 If an idiot accidently shot me in the knee on the range... 
 Sometimes I think that bullet was the best thing to happen to me. 
 I need to use the facilities.

 Irrational, erratic, inconsistent.

 Never thought I'd be "dating" my partner, for example. 
 Are we dating? 
 That's a polite way to say it, yes. 
 That's what the air quotes were for. 
 What? 
 Never mind. 
 Yes, we're dating. 
 So no side projects from now on, okay? 
 Sure.

 Michelle : What's wrong? 
 Oh, uh, nothing. 
 I have to stop by my sister's apartment on the way to work. 
 Natalie : Meet Cindy Reynolds. 
 She's an SVR asset working for the New York Stock Exchange. 
 We're making it look like she's receiving secret orders from Moscow to arrange a drop for the operative who's gonna carry out Black Dagger. 
 Now I embed the file into a jpeg and plant it in the dot over the I in "Cindy" like so. 
 Alex : Steganography. 
 When the task force does a scan and finds this, they'll know the Triggerman is here along with his age, race, and body type. 
 Any questions? 
 What does it mean when a girl says, "No side projects"? 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 You have a girlfriend. 
 No, no, I just...

 Thanks. 
 So what does it mean, this no side projects thing?

 It means she doesn't want you sleeping with other people.

 Well, you wouldn't. 
 Is this someone from work? 
 Holy crap. Alex. 
 Can we not tell mom about this? 
 The last thing I want to talk to mom about is your love life. 
 Romance at work. Tricky.

 Yeah. 
 Is this the woman whose access codes you stole?

 Just remember, what you're doing is gonna keep a lot of people safe, including her. 
 Are you okay? 
 Fine. 
 My mom's all over me to fly home to San Antonio tonight. 
 You don't like seeing your mom? 
 Tomorrow's the anniversary of my sister's death. 
 Not sure getting together to cry over a slab of granite will make us feel better. 
 Maybe your mom needs you there.

 You save lives. 
 You saved mine in Brighton Park, and you'll save more when we stop Black Dagger.

 That we'll stop it. 
 Yes. 
 I never met anyone like you, Alex.

 There's more thumb than office in a lot of these. 
 You try taking covert photos in the middle of a meeting with a paranoid spymaster. 
 So from what you're describing, trying to go in at night would be riskier than going in during the day when the alarms are off. 
 Sure, I only have to know in advance when the Rezident won't be in the building, find a way to get into his office without being seen, and then plant a bug. 
 There has to be a time during the day where he leaves the office regularly. 
 He takes his dog for a walk around the block a couple of times a day. 
 Then there's your window. 
 And for the bug, I can put it in a decanter stopper like this one here. 
 You just have to get into the private office and switch it out.

 So did you find anything? 
 No. 
 Nothing that's odd? 
 I mean, we had solid Intel that the documents we were going for in Rome were Mikhail's documents, that it would be a treasure trove of information about the SVR. 
 The cache has yielded the identities of several undercover SVR officers. 
 Minnows. Paper pushers. 
 What if this whole thing was just a play to get us to spin our wheels? 
 Fly half way around the world chasing a false lead in Rome.
