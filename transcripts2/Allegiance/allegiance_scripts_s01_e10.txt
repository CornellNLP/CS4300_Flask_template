 Katya : Previously on Allegiance... 
 Somehow we need to alert the task force that the operative in charge of Black Dagger is on his way here. 
 We plant a letter for the task force to find. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Nothing. 
 It wasn't there, the file. I opened the JPEG. It was empty. 
 If it's gone, that's because someone went in and erased it. 
 We did an operation recently overseas. 
 There was a particular officer for a period of time who was unaccounted for. 
 So it's the boy genius you took under your wing. 
 Alex O'Connor. 
 Anything you move, put back exactly as it was. 
 He notices everything.

 I've been lying to you. 
 We need to talk.

 You should've tried to sleep. 
 Mm. 
 At least for a few hours. 
 Mark : I tried, but my mind won't shut off, you know. 
 I'll put on some tea. 
 Okay. 
 Things have been moving so fast. 
 I can't remember the last time I had a moment to stop. 
 I tried to lie down, but all I could do was think about the last 20 years, about the life that we made. 
 It all just seems so far away, like some... dream we sold ourselves, and now we are awake. 
 Well, maybe it was a fantasy, but we were happy. 
 We were selfish. 
 We brought Sarah into a world where she will never be safe. 
 Alex, we turned Alex into a criminal. 
 Natalie... at least Natalie had the sense to leave. 
 Do you know the first thought that came into my head when Victor showed up at our door? 
 "What took so long?" 
 I knew the SVR would come back someday.

 Hello? 
 I sent you an email. Check it. 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 Is that the man that you saw in Rome? 
 Yes. 
 Do you know the name Oscar Christoph? 
 We studied him at the Kent School. 
 Operative for hire, assassin. 
 Made his name during the '81 coup in Bangladesh. 
 Suspected of being involved in at least 70 acts of political violence and terrorism before his death in Myanmar in 1994. 
 He was one of the most wanted men in the world. 
 That's him. 
 Christoph. 
 He's dead. 
 He's not. 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 I got to call you back. 
 O'Connor. 
 man over the phone : Alex, this is Special Agent Faber. 
 Listen carefully. 
 You've been set up for murder. 
 Go to the window. 
 If you allow them to arrest you, you'll end up in a 7x10 foot prison cell at ADX supermax in Florence, Colorado. 
 You will spend 23 hours a day there every day for the rest of your life. 
 Alex : Why are you telling me this? 
 Faber : Because I think I know who the mole is in the task force. 
 What do I do? 
 Faber : Run. 
 [tense music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Mark : We got something. 
 Whoever killed Michelle dialed 911 across from her apartment on 156th street. 
 Natalie came through. 
 She hacked into Telecom's database. 
 We need to find surveillance cameras on this corner. 
 Not "we," you can't go anywhere near that crime scene, Alex. 
 You have to go about your daily routines and just act normal, okay? 
 I'm trying. 
 Sam, he... he knows something's wrong, that I lied, I can feel it. 
 Alex, until we know who this mole is, you have to try to stay strong and... 
 Hope I'm not arrested. 
 Yes. 
 Listen, why don't you go back to the hotel and try to get some sleep, okay? 
 Faber : A quantum implant? 
 How the hell did you get it on the computer? 
 You went into his hotel room? 
 All above board, sanctioned by headquarters and DOJ. 
 Why go around me on this? 
 I didn't. 
 Alex's laptop is CIA property. 
 Langley wanted to keep it inside until there was proof of wrongdoing. 
 So you found something? 
 Alex illegally accessed FinCEN using FBI credentials. 
 Michelle Prado's credentials. 
 Anything else? 
 No. 
 What if the evidence you found on his computer was planted? 
 Why would you think that? 
 Because it's the only thing you found. 
 If Alex was the leak, there'd be more. 
 There's always more. 
 He broke the law, Jason. 
 I suspect she discovered the deceit, she confronted him, and he killed her. 
 You know better than to act on suspicion alone. 
 This isn't suspicion. This is evidence of a crime. 
 It's FBI's territory. That's why I'm telling you. 
 But not evidence that Alex O'Connor is the mole. 
 You really think he's capable of pulling off deception at that level? 
 Of killing Michelle? 
 That's what I plan on asking him. 
 We're bringing him in tonight. 
 Not like you, rushing. 
 Why not leave him in play a little longer? 
 Because there is no more time. 
 Black Dagger could happen at any minute, and I think Alex O'Connor knows more about it than we do.

 So many places to hide. 
 Natalie : You're thinking about sight lines, aren't you? 
 I'm thinking about security. 
 We need multiple layers. 
 Motion detectors, infrared cameras, proximity alarms. 
 It would be wise to stash a weapon out there somewhere.

 Recently, I obtained authorization to put a surveillance device on Alex O'Connor's laptop. 
 Information gathered from that action reveals that Alex illegally accessed classified files from Special Agent Prado up until the night she disappeared. 
 We're bringing him in. 
 I know many of you were close with Michelle, so if any of you feel you cannot put aside personal feelings to execute this raid, I understand.

 My brother-in-law bought it in foreclosure. 
 He's turning it into luxury condos. 
 Brooklyn, right? 
 Come inside. It's a little warmer. 
 Oof. 
 Are you sure about Sam? 
 You're never sure. 
 But I've known the man 23 years. 
 His behavior is... off. 
 How? 
 Started when you came back from Rome. 
 He reached out to ask for my advice as a friend. 
 He implied you were dirty, but he was vague. 
 I think he was planting suspicion, softening me up, so I'd accept the narrative about you he was creating. 
 Negative one. 
 Michelle disappears, and Sam goes behind my back for a warrant to access your computer. 
 Why? 
 To plant evidence to lead the task force to conclude that you're the mole. 
 He was covering his tracks, Alex. 
 Alex, I need you to be completely honest with me about Michelle. 
 I-I didn't hurt her. 
 I-I never would. 
 I know you wouldn't. 
 I don't see it in you. 
 [sighs] 
 Here. Have a seat. 
 But you did use her login codes to access an FBI database. 
 Why? 
 Hmm? 
 Sam wouldn't murder a federal agent for no reason. 
 It's enormous exposure. 
 Had to be reason enough to justify the risk. 
 Here's my theory. 
 Whatever Michelle knew came from you, right? 
 You uncovered something, and it was big. 
 For some reason, you couldn't come directly into the task force with it, so you confided in Michelle. 
 You trusted her. 
 But the information made her nervous, uneasy. 
 So she turned to the one person inside the task force she could trust, Sam. 
 And it got her killed. 
 I'm sorry, Alex. 
 Oscar Christoph. 
 The man who helped mastermind the Beirut barracks bombing in '83? 
 And took down the President of Pakistan's jet in '88. 
 Yes. 
 Christoph is dead, Alex. 
 Died in an helicopter crash in Myanmar, what, 20 years ago. 
 This was taken two days ago. 
 Christoph's in New York. 
 He's the operative who's going to carry out Black Dagger. 
 That's what I told Michelle. 
 I told her about Christoph. 
 Why couldn't you walk it in? 
 'Cause there's a mole inside the task force and I didn't have that picture, solid evidence yet. 
 And you're protecting a source, hmm? 
 Send me the picture. 
 I'll put it through Homeland Security. 
 Oh, boy.

 You really think we can make up for all the things that we've done?

 We're going to get out with Sarah. We're going to run. 
 We tried that once. We didn't get very far. 
 We know so much more right now.

 You're protecting someone, maybe for good reason, but you're facing treason. 
 You're being set up for murder, and I'm putting my ass and career on the line to help you.

 I really do, but I...

 Stopping the attack was my sole focus, and we've done that by alerting the DHS.
