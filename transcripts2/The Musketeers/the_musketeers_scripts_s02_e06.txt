 (Horse whinnies) 
 Signore Galileo has proven the moon circles the Earth, as the Earth circles the sun. 
 As the new moon orbits the Earth, it moves in front of the sun, like so. 
 Milady de Winter, would you do us the honour of playing the moon? 
 But I am Venus, sire. 
 Well, for the purposes of the experiment, you shall be the moon and the Queen will be the Earth. 
 It sickens me to see the Queen humiliated like this. 
 I can't be here. I'm going back to the garrison. 
 The King will notice your absence. 
 I doubt it, he only seems to have eyes for one thing. 
 See how the moon blocks the light of the sun from the Earth? 
 For a moment, only darkness prevails. 
 But then, as the moon moves on... the light slowly returns to the Earth. 
 A brilliant explanation! 
 The great astronomer Marmion could not equal it. 
 They say he has transformed the old fort at Chatillon into a mysterious new world. 
 We shall see. 
 Yes, Marmion? 
 Is everything ready for our guests? 
 I've seen to it myself. 
 Good. 
 Call. 
 Heads. 
 So it begins. 
 Welcome, sire. The great Marmion is busy with his final preparations. 
 I am his servant, Robert. 
 The old fort is the perfect setting for your viewing of the eclipse and the camera obscura. 
 If you can see the rotating mirror on the roof, sire. 
 Now, stop there. Let me guess. 
 It reflects an image of the sun through a glass lens to a viewing surface inside the building. 
 With perfect clarity, Your Majesty. 
 They say an eclipse is like God putting his hand over the sun. 
 I can't help being nervous. 
 There's nothing to be scared of. 
 I know that. It's just... a feeling. 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 Protection for your eyes, Your Majesty. 
 Thank you very much. 
 How wonderful! 
 Now I can stare at you without being dazzled, sire. 
 Secure the house. No intrusions, no visitors. 
 Welcome, Your Majesty. 
 I am Marmion. 
 Follow me, Your Majesty. 
 The great astronomer! 
 All Paris is talking of the eclipse. 
 May I present the camera obscura? 
 My wonderful device will allow Your Majesties to witness every detail. 
 Porthos? 
 I'll check downstairs. 
 I'll check the other side. 
 Our forefathers regarded a solar eclipse as a sign the world was ending. 
 Luckily, we are all modern men now. 
 And yet, we must still allow God a place in the universe. 
 When the darkness comes, will we all feel His dread hand upon us? 
 Curb your taste for showmanship, Marmion. 
 The King has no time for nonsense. 
 At this fateful moment, we must consider our own place in the universe. 
 Do we control our fate, or are we merely the playthings of a power beyond understanding? 
 If I wanted a sermon, Marmion, I would have gone to church! 
 (Tittering) 
 Behold! The motion of the heavens! 
 You'll soon be wearing it again. 
 I was a damn fool. I should have taken that position on the Council when the King offered it. He has Rochefort now. He doesn't need me. 
 You're still a Musketeer. 
 No. 
 There'll be a new captain soon. 
 The eclipse. 
 Oh, no! 
 (Screaming) 
 Aramis? Porthos! 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Women scream) One more step, and the King dies. No! Porthos? Ugh! (She whimpers) (Baby cries) There is no escape. You should have gone to the old fort with the King. Your place is at his side. I had duties here. I don't need watching over, if that's what you're doing. The idea never crossed my mind. (Horse whinnies) This place has been my home for too long. It's time for a change. End this now and the King might yet grant you clemency. Will you, sire? If I say sorry, will all my sins be forgiven? Yes. I will consider it. We both know you would hang me from the nearest tree. The die is cast. There is no turning back. Show some compassion and at least let the women and the dauphin go. What did you say? Have compassion. Let the baby and the women go. Aramis! No! (Gunshot echoes) I'm going to kill you. I, too, have lost friends. I, too, know the anguish of bereavement. The powerlessness, the injustice. You talk too much. Take him to the cellar. (He grunts) You won't get away with this. You know the King's absence will be noted. You don't think someone will come looking? We have hours yet to entertain ourselves. I'll have your head for this. Take him with the other. That one can stay. The game must be witnessed. You cared enough to defend him. Why? Because I care about him, and because he's my friend. Then tie these friends together. They can bring each other comfort. (Baby mewls) We'll get out of here. All right? (They grunt and gasp) You think he means to kill the King? God knows. But whatever he wants, he's been planning this for a long time. Can you move? Argh! Stop! Argh! (He sighs) It's no good. Can't you Musketeers do anything useful? Of all the people in all the world, I've got to be chained to you! Your friend should have kept his mouth shut. We wouldn't be here and he might still be alive. Aramis will be all right. Are you mad? The fall will have broken his neck. You don't know Aramis. I admire your optimism, however deluded. If we're going to get out of this, we'll have to work together. Agreed? Agreed. The time has come to make choices. What kind of choices? Simple ones with simple outcomes. A fair likeness. Call. To what purpose? That is the fun of the game. You don't know. But you must call. Not unless you tell me why. Call correctly and you leave. But call wrong and you die. You don't mean it? (Shall we find out?) Call. Is there someone here braver than your King? Someone willing to gamble everything for freedom? I'll do it. Ah! You understand the rules? There can be no second chances, no pleading or negotiation. The immutable laws of chance must dictate the outcome. Frankly, I would rather be dead than listen to your endless babble for one more minute. Very well. Call your fate. Milady, don't do it. Don't play his game! I'm touched by your concern. I order you not to risk your life, Milady. Well, perhaps I can help. Heads. I call heads. You win. You may go. I forbid it! If the King cannot have his freedom, no-one can! The rules must be obeyed. I order you to stay, Milady! In this room, I am king. And I say she goes. If my men see the King's army approaching, everyone here will be dead by the time they dismount. Heads. I call heads, too! (Coin pings) No! No. Another chance. Give me another chance! (Gunshot) (Scream) Anyone else? Get me a horse. Fast! Well, don't just stand there! Hurry up! (Horse whinnies) (Crow caws) (Flapping and cawing) (Shards tinkle) (He sighs) (Cawing) If we could get one of those hooks, we can prise these locks off. And if we only had wings, we could fly out of the window(!) You think me cruel. But life is cruel. One person lives, another dies. There is no reason or rhyme to it. We make our choices and then fate intervenes. How would fate intervene? We all share the same fate, the same luck. There's nothing anyone can do about that. But some of us have the dice loaded in our favour by wealth and privilege. Some of you don't know what it is to make harsh choices. In your ease and comfort, you have never had to face them. Life is about choice, Marmion. It can't be avoided. And some choices are unpleasant and they have to be made. But there are always consequences. My point exactly! And a king's choices are the hardest of all. I am glad to see you engaging in the spirit of the game. Take them. No! NO! No, no! No! No! (Baby cries) No! No! Not my son! I beg you not to harm him! It is not up to me. It is you who must choose. Let me go with them. My duty is at the Queen's side. Take the others. It's all right. (Women gasp) What are you going to do with them? Only what fate decides. If you let us go, you will be well rewarded. You don't have to suffer for Marmion's crimes. Marmion is my brother. I'd follow him to Hell if he asked me. Hell is where you're going for this! I've been there already, my lady. It doesn't frighten me any more. No matter what you intend to do, please don't hurt my son. He's only an innocent baby. Innocent now. But what will he be when he's a king? (Baby mewls) (Baby cries) Get this stuff on the wagons. NOW! (He grunts) Let us go free and there will be another one of THESE for you. (He gasps) What will they do to us? Marguerite? SHE SOBS I'm so afraid. We're both afraid. But we must not show it. We have the Musketeers to protect us. Aramis. Aramis is dead. The fall... (Horse whinnies) (Horse snorts) Get out of my way! What are you doing here? We need to speak now! Get Athos. What? You never seen a woman before? From the look of you, probably not! Brother, a word. What have you done with the Queen and my son? Nothing... yet. The game is just beginning. (Sit down.) (Sorry I brought you into this.) (If I'd never spoken to the Queen, you wouldn't be here.) You only wanted the best for me. (You're the bravest woman I've ever known.) Did you really think we could do this without spilling a little blood? I didn't sign up for a mass slaughter. You said you wanted to teach them a lesson. If we kill these people, how are we better than them? I wish I'd never married. I wish I was free. I wish a lot of things. But we can't change how the world is made. We can do anything if we dare, Constance. Do you really believe that? Always. Robert. I love you. Because of this king we are the only family we have left. Do you trust me? Do you have faith? Remember the plague years. Trust me, Brother. Hm? Time to make a choice, Your Majesty. What choice? Shall I send this man into room one or room two? What do these rooms contain? In one of them is your queen, her servant and your son... in the other, three of your loyal courtiers. So, which room is it to be? What do you intend to do? Your Majesty, do not answer him. I will handle this. Do not answer him! Sadly, the King's answer is the only one that matters. She is a liar and a cheat. Why should we trust her? Aramis is dead. The King is in terrible danger. But by all means, let's discuss my moral character. We have all day. I'll gather the men. If they see a troop of Musketeers, he will kill the King. How many men does he have? Ten that I saw. Possibly more. We need to surprise them. "We"? I know the way in. I'll need you. All right. I'll keep them out of sight until I know the King is safe. Why do you keep staring at me? I'm surprised. For once, you actually seem to care about something other than yourself. If the King dies I lose my position in Court. It would be a catastrophe. Forgive me for being naive. Now, find me something to wear! Take that one. You can't mean it. You can't be so much of a monster. I wasn't once. But this world made me one. Now, choose. Which room? I don't know who is where. That's the beauty of it. A choice made blind. Hoping for the best. I don't know what you've done with my wife... and my son. My baby son. The dauphin is only a few months old. What harm can he have done to anyone? What harm has the Queen done? Or any of us? It is not me who would injure them. Fate will decide and the King is the vehicle of fate. How can I make such a choice when the stakes are so high? Now, you are learning the game. Choose, or I will send this man into both rooms. (He strains) Another few inches would do it. Save your strength. Survival is about being patient. I learnt that in a Spanish prison. Five years in gaol. That must have been tough. How did you get through it? You really want to know? I wouldn't be asking otherwise. There was a woman. The thought of her kept me alive. I never had you down as the romantic type. Because you know nothing about me. True. You and this... woman. Did you two, erm... get together when you got out? She's married. But her feelings for me haven't changed. Who is she? As if I would tell you. One day she will be mine. You'll have to sort her husband out first. A minor detail. Sounds like you've got it all planned out. We're done talking now. Suits me. You ready? Yes. The first room or the second? One or two? (he mouths) One. May God forgive me. What, Brother? You swore you would show mercy. What mercy was shown to our friends and family? Have you forgotten their suffering? You always intended it would end like this. (Slashing, terrified screams) (Screams echo) Who did you kill? Who did you kill?! Goddamn you! Don't torment him! The Queen and your son are alive. Did you kill the others? It was the King's choice that sealed their fate. It had nothing to do with fate. You murdered them. I take no pleasure in their deaths. What happened to you? What made you like this? I had to make choices once. Impossible choices. Life for one, death for another. Playing God with the lives of the people I loved. Now, you also know what it feels like - the gift of life and death. For the first time in your life, you understand what YOUR choices really mean. So, what did you think of the eclipse? Quite the spectacle! 
 
 (Door rattles) Your Majesty. We thought you were dead! Are you all unharmed? We are quite well. And the King? Alive when we left him. If I hadn't found you in time... Once again, you are my saviour. You still wear it. Always. Thank God. Thank God you're alive. Forgive me, Your Majesty. I'm forgetting myself. Your joy is understandable. I share it. My son is quite well, Aramis. And better for your protection. One day he will come to know the loyalty and bravery of his Musketeers as I do. We have to get you out of here. I cannot leave while the King is in danger. His first concern will be the safety of the dauphin. Make sure you stay close to me. So how does this end, Marmion? Hm? You kill us all and then what? What have you achieved? Balance. A harmony in nature. A shout of defiance in the face of an indifferent universe. If I'm going to die for a cause I'd like to know what it is. Does the name Gerberoy mean anything to you? Gerberoy? No. It is - or was - a village an hour or two east from here. The kind of humble place a gentleman rides through quickly. But it was home to a community of a hundred souls or more. It was our home. One day the plague struck without warning. People who were healthy at sunrise were dying by nightfall. How can you blame me for this? The King cannot contain the plague. The plague was harsh. But it was burning itself out. We even began to believe God had spared us the worst of it. Then orders came from the King. The village was to be blockaded to prevent the spread of infection. Anyone who tried to escape was shot. Plague villages have to be contained to save other lives. Food should have been left for us, but it never came. It wasn't infection that killed us. It was hunger. YOU starved us to death out of sheer indifference. I had to look at my family, my wife, our two boys. I had to choose who would get the scraps of food I scavenged. Choose who should live and die. My wife wouldn't touch a bite while her children were hungry. She withered away before my eyes. At the end, I only had enough food for one of my dying boys. I had to choose between them... but I loved them both too much. So I tossed a coin and let fate decide. My youngest was saved. But a week later, he died anyway. Now, you also know what it feels like to condemn one innocent to save another. I've a message for Marmion. The master isn't receiving guests. If you don't let me in, he's going to be very angry. Never keep a lady waiting! Try from your side. Ready? Yeah. (He strains) The plaster's old. If I could get a proper grip... Try again. Ready? Yeah. (He strains) OK. Go for it. And don't stop, no matter what. Are you sure? Just do it! (They shout) Couldn't get a glass of wine, could I? Bit parched. Can you walk? It's my shoulder that's dislocated, not my legs. You'll have to put it back in. I'm not a doctor. Brace yourself and pull as hard as you can. Any fool could do it. This will hurt. Just get on with it! It'll be my pleasure. (He cries out in pain) That was either a wounded bull... or Porthos. What was all that noise about? I hurt my shoulder. Is that all? I thought you'd been dismissed. Until the King says otherwise, I'm still a Musketeer. Then make yourself useful and give me a pistol. What's she doing here? She's... helping us. You'll have to explain that to me later. Do you really think that your family would want you to do this in revenge? To play God with other people's lives? How can I know what they would want? They're not here to tell me. We are all that's left of our village. We should have died, but we didn't. We were kept alive for a purpose. Gerberoy is gone but we shall see it is never forgotten. I heard you broke a window. Better that than my neck. Athos. Oh, Your Majesty. Thank God you're safe. It's good to see you, Captain. God was watching over you, Your Majesty. God and the Musketeers. How's the King? He's still with Marmion. I pray he hasn't been harmed. Next time try using the door, all right? This is all very moving, but can we get on with the business of saving the King? Get the Queen to safety. And come straight back. They'll know the King is missing by now. They'll have sent the guards. We need to get out while we still have a chance. Just a little longer. We'll leave now when there's still time to escape. We'll just melt back into the land. They'll never find us. No-one leaves until the King has suffered as we did. You have tormented him with the loss of his family. You've made him realise what he did to us. What more can you teach him? He can learn what it is to be dead inside, to spend every moment as a living corpse. You never intended for us to leave, did you? You mean for us to die here. You can still turn back from the brink. Look, it's not too late, Jacques. Jacques died in Gerberoy. I am Marmion. Untie her. No, you can't. Please do not harm her. Please don't harm her. I beg you, please. Time to make another choice, Your Majesty. Call correctly and the woman goes free. But get it wrong and she dies. No! Why? What has she ever done to you? Nothing. She is an innocent, as my children were. Why should she be spared and not them? Well? Are you ready? Of course, you can always refuse, but then I'll just kill her anyway. No, Your Majesty. I beg you, don't call. Don't make his call! Don't. Don't. Tails. No, Marmion. Wait! Wait! Please, wait! Please! Look me in the eyes before you kill me. Think of your wife and children and how they would judge you now. Do that, then shoot if you want. Do not talk of them to me. They'd be ashamed. She's right, Jacques. It's not my choice. The rules of the game must be observed. Then take me, then. Take me. My life for hers. You want a life? Take mine. No, d'Artagnan. You think I can just stand there and watch you die? I won't do it. I can't do it. Let us test your resolve. Untie him. You're free to go. Yes. I offer you your release. You can live the rest of your life in careless freedom. But she dies. Please, d'Artagnan. Go. Get help. Not a chance. There is no need for your sacrifice. You can live. I've made my offer. You would die for her? Why? Because I love her. Promise me you'll let her go. One life for another. Why not? The girl lives, you die. Please, Brother, don't do this. Please. The game must be played to the end. (Gunshot sounds) No! (She sobs) Why? It was my choice, Brother. There's two. Right. You two take this corridor, we'll take the lower. Attack on my command. Yes, Captain. Stay here... you'll be safe. You almost sound as though you care. I'm coming with you. Marmion, wait. Marmion, listen to me. What now? Another sacrifice? Your life for the King's? No, yours. Follow the rules of your own game. Either the King dies or you let us all go. Let the coin decide. D'Artagnan, have you gone mad? At least this way you get a chance. No, you're right. Fate must decide. I don't like this game. Call correctly and you all live. If you are wrong, you personally will execute the King. I forbid this! You make the call. If the King's head is face up, he dies. If it is tails, you all live. (He sobs) No! Please! Now! (Shouts and gunfire) You're welcome. Where's Marmion? Find him! I want his head! I want him dead! Stay there, sire. You're safe. The dauphin? The Queen? Safe and well, Your Majesty. Thank God! You'll soon be reunited. Go! Take this, you must go! MARMION! (Pistol clicks) Aren't you going to plead for your life? Why? Are you going to show mercy? No. You can't kill a man who's already dead. Mm, I've never much cared for riddles. (Gunshot sounds) The traitor Marmion is dead! Rochefort, you are a hero. Your prompt arrival saved me, while you encouraged that madman to gamble with my life. I had to stall him, sire. It's all I could think of. I admit you played a brave part, but it was a very dangerous game. Thank God you are well, sire. You deserted your king, madame. And you are dressed like a man. I risked my life to get help. Vacate your rooms in the Louvre immediately. Rochefort, come. We must discuss how I can be better protected. So, that is the reward for virtue. To be left with nothing. Not entirely. You have my respect. Once upon a time that might have been important to me. Thank God. Oh, thank God! You have suffered too much in my service, Constance. I am sorry for it. I'm only glad to see you and the dauphin safe and well. Why does everyone hate me? The people love you, sire. There will always be lunatics and malcontents. These days they seem to be hiding around every corner. Rochefort will keep them from me. I love you. I know. I don't care what people think. I don't care what they say. This is my life and I want to spend the rest of it with you. Do I get a say in this? Isn't that young woman married? Yes, sire. I believe she is. Bless this forthcoming marriage, O Lord. I pray my marriage will be happy. Get her behind cover! Inside! Aramis wears a jewelled crucifix. Bring it to me. You mean the Princess might still be in danger? There's no need for alarm. We're in Paris now. She'll be perfectly safe. D'Artagnan and I, we love each other. You think I'll accept your charity? If you have any sense. Put him on the table. Gently! Whoever did this to the Captain is going to answer to me personally.
