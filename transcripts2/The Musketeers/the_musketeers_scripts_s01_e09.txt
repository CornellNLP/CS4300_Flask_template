 Ha-hah! 
 Last time... Mind the uniform. 
 It doesn't look right on you. 
 Too shiny, too new. 
 It's like your mum's dressed you. 
 Exactly. Aramis, what do you think? 
 I think we've landed in paradise. 
 BIRDSONG 
 Listen to that. What? 
 BIRDSONG 
 ARAMIS WHISTLES 
 BIRDSONG 
 HE WHISTLES 
 Ugh! Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 That looks better. Much better. 
 Who knows, one day, he might even land a hit. 
 Never going to happen! 
 WOMAN GIGGLES 
 PEACOCK CRIES 
 Are all the Frenchmen as witty as you, Your Majesty? 
 Certainly not. 
 SHE GIGGLES I pray your daughter will accompany us to the country. 
 Mmm. She can enjoy the gardens while we hunt. 
 Or I could hunt with you. 
 Charlotte is quite the shot. 
 In Hamburg, ladies shoot? 
 CHARLOTTE LAUGHS 
 Ah, you are such a tease, Your Majesty! 
 What if I am? 
 Your daughter's an enchanting young lady, Count Mellendorf. 
 I am proud to say her two sisters have made excellent matches. 
 Blessed me with nine grandchildren, seven boys. 
 CHARLOTTE CONTINUES TO LAUGH 
 I'm sure you're determined that Charlotte will marry equally as well. 
 She does bring a very substantial dowry. 
 CHARLOTTE GASPS AND LAUGHS 
 Well, that's settled, then. 
 We're all going hunting. 
 Prepare the hounds, falcons and the full musketeer escort. 
 You can hold the fort in our absence, can't you, Cardinal? 
 Certainly, Your Majesty. 
 I'm sorry I can't accompany you, sire, but my men know what is expected of them. 
 Oh, you will be missed, Captain. 
 We will show our guests how the French hunt. 
 With style and panache, and a cold eye for the kill. 
 SHE LAUGHS 
 Cardinal? 
 If only Anne were more like Charlotte Mellendorf. 
 More engaged and interesting. 
 More interested in outdoor pursuits. 
 What is rare is wonderful. 
 You're not married to a woman who recoils from your touch. 
 The Queen has many remarkable qualities. 
 But bearing children isn't one of them. 
 She is young. There is still time. 
 Dispatches from Bourbon-les-eaux say she's in fine spirits. 
 The waters there are renowned for their powers of fertility. 
 Anne has been going there for years, and still, nothing. 
 If only I'd married a woman who can give me what I truly need most, a son and heir! If Charlotte Mellendorf was my Queen, I would fill this palace with children! 
 I suspect those are the opinions of the wine and not the King. 
 Her father's bank could finance all our wars. 
 She would make the perfect wife. 
 Except, Your Majesty is already married. 
 Better if Anne were dead. Better for me, better for the country. 
 All our problems would be solved. 
 I would have a wife who truly understands me, and France would have an heir. 
 A hopeless dream, Cardinal.

 WOMAN SCREAMS 
 Monsieur Gallagher? 
 How many are they? 
 Five. 
 Maybe more. Too many to count. 
 They're in the barn. 
 Gallagher. 
 I have a job for you. 
 Something more... befitting of your talents. 
 And who will I be working for? 
 Me, of course. 
 And the most powerful man in Paris. 
 BIRDSONG 
 Leave the birds alone. 
 I hate these birds and their... 
 HE WHISTLES 
 Agh! 
 I thought this was paradise. 
 That was two days ago. 
 Now...I'm bored. I miss Paris, the excitement, the noise. 
 BIRDSONG GUN COCKS 
 The danger. 
 Aramis! 
 That wasn't me. 
 Your Majesty! 
 Caroline? 
 She borrowed my robe. 
 Get her under cover! Your Majesty! 
 Stay down! 
 Stay with the Queen. 
 Get to the horses. 
 You and I have an assassin to catch. 
 GUNSHOT 
 Now! 
 Damn! 
 D'Artagnan, how are we doing? 
 Go! Right. 
 One man on his own. 
 Shouldn't be a problem. 
 On the other hand... 
 HORSES NEIGH 
 Shoot them! 
 We'll leave through the forest, lose them in the trees! 
 You should have killed at least one of them. 
 Yaah! Go! Yaah, yaah! 
 Yaah! 
 Yaah! Yaah! Come on! Yaah! 
 Cardinal? 
 Choosing a son-in-law is a father's greatest responsibility. 
 Charlotte's husband will be a fortunate man. 
 Perhaps even a fortunate Frenchman. 
 If you are asking if I am disposed to a French alliance, yes...with the right suitor. 
 DOG BARKS 
 But I value my darling Charlotte highly, Cardinal. 
 Very highly indeed. 
 I'm certain we can find someone worthy of her. 
 Charlotte... You and your father will ride with me. 
 SHE GIGGLES 
 Hyaah! 
 Hyup! Yaah! Hyup! 
 Hyup! Yes, come on! 
 It's all right. Hyah! Hyah! 
 Keep going. 
 They're still following us? 
 Yes, and they're not tiring. 
 Determined. 
 What if we can't lose them? We will. 
 What if we don't? 
 We've been in much worse situations than this and always prevailed. 
 You've nothing to fear. 
 This is a relatively quiet day for us! 
 Time to go. 
 HE CLICKS TONGUE 
 There's been no sign of them for an hour now. 
 We're safe for a while. 
 The Queen needs to rest. 
 Can I help? 
 I mean, not catching fish, of course, but...anything to help. 
 Rest while you can, Your Majesty. 
 Soon, we'll be riding again. 
 No, I'd like to be useful. 
 Really. 
 Well, in that case, can you gut a fish? 
 Porthos is preparing a fire. 
 I'm sure he'll appreciate help collecting sticks. Thank you. 
 And I'm sure I can cook a little. 
 Mmm... 
 Delicious, Your Majesty. Hmm. 
 HE GRUNTS 
 It's the first time I've ever cooked. 
 That's...hard to believe. 
 Would you like another? 
 Thank you, but...I'm full. 
 Ah... 
 HE CLEARS THROAT 
 HORSES' HOOVES POUNDING 
 Shh. 
 CLINKING HORSES' HOOVES POUNDING 
 D'Artagnan. Your Majesty. 
 I'm tired of running away. 
 Perhaps we should be the ones doing the chasing. 
 The Queen's safety is paramount. 
 We can't risk it by making a stand. 
 Nor can we outride them forever. 
 When we can't, then we'll fight. 
 Hyup, hyup! 
 Yaah! 
 Look. 
 You two ride to Paris and get reinforcements. 
 We'll hold up in there till you return. What, just you two? 
 Alone? Thank you for the vote of confidence(!) 
 We won't be back before tomorrow at the earliest. 
 There's at least a dozen of them. 
 In that case, you'd better hurry. 
 Good luck. Hyaah, hyaah, hyaah! 
 Hup! 
 These gates are never closed! 
 This is an emergency. 
 Everyone is welcome here at any time of night or day. 
 We are King's musketeers. 
 I answer to a higher power. 
 This is your Queen. 
 It is your duty to protect her. 
 Close the gate, sister! 
 Hyaah! Hyaah! 
 Come on! Hup! Yaah! 
 Hyaah! Hyaah! 
 Aramis : Athos! 
 You are welcome, Your Majesty. 
 Our humble convent is your sanctuary. 
 Do we talk or shoot? 
 If you've come to surrender, I accept. 
 I heard a sense of humour can be of comfort when facing death. 
 Then what do you want? 
 To offer you your freedom. 
 Hand over the Queen, I'll let everyone else live. 
 Or you could leave now and I won't kill you. 
 He had a chance to kill you and he wasted it. 
 If that's how I deal with my own men, imagine what I'll do with you. 
 In case you think there's anyone coming for you, there isn't. 
 My men will see to it your two friends don't make it to Paris. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 It's what I'm good at. 
 This is not how a soldier behaves. 
 A white flag. Officer's boots. 
 Your men holding line. 
 Whatever I once was... I'm not a soldier now. 
 You may not have the uniform, but once a soldier... 
 And soldiers don't kill women. 
 Just the one. 
 You've made an error in judgment. 
 I understand. 
 You can ride away and still have your honour. 
 I've given my word. 
 I cannot break it. 
 Without that, I have nothing. 
 You'd have your life. 
 Stay here and I will kill you. 
 One of us will die. 
 That's certain. 
 The nuns are free to leave without fear of harm, but anyone who chooses to remain in the convent...will be killed. 
 Aaah! 
 Ain't this better than trying to escape? 
 Ask me again in two minutes, if I'm still alive. 
 HE CHUCKLES 
 Hyah! Hyah! Hup! 
 Argh! 
 Come on! 
 Agh! 
 Porthos! 
 What's that? 
 Nothing I've seen before. 
 A promissory note, to be cashed at a moneylender's in the Rue de Bonnasse... in Paris. 
 I urge you to leave now. 
 You will not be harmed. 
 We could take the Queen with us, disguised as a sister. 
 If she's recognised outside, we can't protect her. 
 The Queen stays with us. 
 Anyone who wishes to leave may go now, with my blessing. 
 It seems we are all at your service. 
 Your loyalty will not be forgotten. 
 We need to barricade the gate... 
 You can use tables from the refectory. 
 ..and establish two lookout points, each with a clear sight of anyone approaching. 
 My bedroom and the sacristy are best. 
 You don't happen to have any weapons here? 
 One musket and some charges. 
 For shooting rabbits... and Protestants. 
 There is something else we could use. 
 I can show Aramis. 
 Come, dear. 
 Let me help you. 
 PANTING 
 You sell this? 
 Saving souls isn't cheap. 
 My father had a still just like this. 
 HE RAPS LID 
 He made grape and honey brandy all the time. 
 May I? Mm-hm. 
 HE SNIFFS 
 It's exactly like my father's. 
 Probably because I use his recipe. 
 You still don't recognise me, do you, Aramis? 
 Isabelle? 
 Isabelle is gone. 
 Now I am Sister Helene. 
 I thought you could light the bottles with cloth and throw them. 
 It'll be gruesome, but effective. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm a nun. This is a convent. 
 You know what I mean. 
 Aramis, Athos needs you. 
 You should go. 
 Thank you. 
 You stay in here. 
 I'll take the other room. 
 Do say if you're not happy. 
 No, no. I'm happy, or as happy as any man in our predicament can be. 
 If it's any consolation, Mother Superior is next door, praying for our immortal souls. 
 Right now, it's my mortal body I'm worried about. 
 Captain! 
 Where is everybody? 
 The regiment's gone off hunting with the King. 
 What? No-one else here but me, one-eyed Florian, and Jacques the stable boy. 
 Where are the others? 
 Where is the Queen? 
 FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING 
 It is done. 
 Don't tell me you have qualms, because in your line of work, conscience is no asset. 
 An ordinary death does not concern me, but this is no ordinary death. 
 I am aware of that. 
 There's been an attempt on the Queen's life. 
 She's safe, at least for the time being. 
 Here. Thank you. 
 That nun, the one you were with downstairs... 
 I'm sorry, my arrival was a disturbance. 
 You did not disturb anything. 
 I may be cosseted, but I'm not a fool. 
 I knew her...once. 
 We were to marry. 
 And you changed your mind? 
 She fell pregnant and the marriage was arranged. 
 I was happy. 
 I was in love, and so was she. 
 But then she lost the child and her father... took her away and put her in here. 
 I never saw her again, not until today. 
 I think they're about to... GUNSHOT ..attack. Come with me to the chapel. 
 Agh! 
 
 
 
 I've sent word to inform the King of the situation. 
 I'll have my musketeers return her to Paris immediately. 
 But that'd take about six, maybe seven hours. 
 Can your men hold the convent long enough for rescue to arrive? 
 As long as Athos and Aramis draw breath, they will do their duty. 
 I'm sure. These assassins, do we know anything about them? 
 Mercenaries. This promissory note was found on one of them. 
 Whoever hired them is in Paris. 
 May I see that? 
 When you find the person behind this, I will ensure that their punishment is exemplary. 
 HE GASPS You assured me... 
 Gallagher could do this. 
 Instead, I find... the Queen is still alive. 
 He will finish what he has begun. 
 And will he also steal back the promissory note he so carelessly mislaid? Well?! 
 I will see to it. 
 I hope so, because if this goes wrong... SHE SOBS ..you... will pay a very great price. 
 My parents always hoped I'd end up in a place like this. 
 They wanted you to become a nun? 
 Ha-ha! A priest. 
 Why didn't you? 
 Cos I found I was better at dispatching people to hell! 
 Hail, Mary, full of grace. 
 The Lord is with thee. 
 Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit...

 STREET CHATTER 
 Hello? 
 DOOR CREAKS 
 DISTANT DOG BARKING 
 Not like a moneylender to leave his rooms unattended. 
 Perhaps he's the trusting type. 
 DOOR CREAKS 
 Too trusting, apparently. 
 DOOR CREAKS 
 We need to find some record of the promissory note. 
 Can either of you smell jasmine? 
 Look for his accounts ledger. 
 HE SNIFFS 
 I've found it. 
 D'Artagnan! Porthos! 
 D'Artagnan! 
 This is his ledger. 
 The entry for the note says it was purchased in gold by the German Count Daniel Mellendorf. 
 Mellendorf and his daughter are hunting with the King. 
 The beneficiary of the note didn't sign his name, but he left a mark. 
 HE RAPS TABLE 
 We've seen that before. 
 Tattooed on the hand of one of the assassins. 
 It's the mark of Hugh O'Neill, a Catholic chieftain who was exiled from Ireland, had his land taken. 
 Men bearing this brand were O'Neill's private guard. 
 Soldiers? 
 Much more than just soldiers. 
 More like musketeers. 
 We need to get back to the convent as soon as possible. 
 We can't wait for the regiment. 
 STREET CHATTER 
 What is it? 
 Someone was there. 
 I smelled her scent. 
 Her? It was a woman. 
 I'm sure of it. 
 I didn't see anyone. 
 She was there. 
 We don't have time to search for her now. The Queen's life's at stake! 
 According to that, the mercenaries were hired by Count Mellendorf. 
 Makes no sense. 
 Mellendorf is here seeking a husband for his daughter. 
 If the Queen were out of the way, the King would be free to marry again. 
 Murdering the Queen? 
 Isn't that a bit extreme? 
 He's a very ambitious man. 
 HORSE WHINNIES 
 The moneylender's assassin was a woman. 
 A woman? 
 Send the regiment after us... the moment they return. Of course. 
 You were seen. 
 Yet again, you were careless! 
 They said a woman. 
 Paris is full of women. 
 The promissory note is dealt with. 
 They believe Mellendorf is behind all of this. 
 It cannot be traced back to you. 
 Mellendorf's rooms are in the east wing in the hunting lodge. 
 I believe this belongs to him. 
 It's very quiet. 
 Perhaps prayer has driven them away. 
 More likely, they're devising a new plan of attack. 
 One that won't cost them so many men. 
 These will help keep them at bay. 
 For months... 
 I never forgot you. 
 What we had together. 
 What did we have? 
 A life, waiting to be lived. 
 That isn't how I recall it. 
 I remember a young man being forced to marry a girl he'd seduced and made pregnant. 
 Not true. No doubt, a little part of him was relieved when the baby was gone and he didn't have to marry. 
 You were never meant for marriage, Aramis. 
 That was clear even then. 
 You wouldn't have been happy. 
 With you, I would. 
 You and I, somewhere in the country, children at our feet, without the excitement and adventure you crave? 
 I cannot see it. Can you? 
 Yes. 
 No, you can't. 
 Your father robbed us of a life together when he stole you away. 
 I begged him to tell me where you were, but he refused. 
 Because I asked him not to. 
 He didn't put me here. 
 It was my choice. 
 Why? It was the right thing to do. 
 Look at us now. 
 We've both found our true vocation. 
 Mine to God, and yours to the sword. 
 We would have made each other miserable. 
 Believe me... 
 I acted out of kindness. 
 Someone's coming. 
 MUFFLED CRIES 
 GUN COCKS 
 Where are the Musketeers? 
 SHE GASPS Speak, or you will never utter another word! 
 Aramis : Isabelle! 
 MUFFLED CRIES 
 Agh! Urgh! 
 Aramis! Isabelle! 
 Isabelle! Isabelle! 
 I'm sorry... I'm sorry. 
 We will see each other again in Heaven. Of that, I am certain. 
 But not too soon, I hope. No. No. No. 
 Isabelle... 
 Isabelle. 
 Oh, no. 
 Just two of them? 
 HE CLEARS THROAT 
 Yes. 
 We'd better block that up. 
 We'll take her to the small chapel. 
 Come, sisters. 
 SOBBING 
 You really think this will work? 
 All they'll see is the uniform, not who's wearing it. 
 Don't know what they'll do to the enemy. 
 They frighten the life out of me! 
 With respect, sir, are you sure you can ride with that shoulder? 
 Are you going to stop me? 
 Not needed. I'm bringing Cleopatra out of retirement. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Been responsible for more deaths than her namesake. 
 Looks just as ancient. Better take this, huh? Just in case.

 A few years after I married, I too fell pregnant. 
 It was perfect. 
 I could feel my child inside me... moving and kicking. 
 I had his whole life planned out, what he would do and... be like. 
 And then...I lost the baby. 
 Six years, and I've never forgotten that child, not for a single day. 
 I am certain that Sister Helene never forgot you... or your baby. 
 All these years, I believed Isabelle was the only woman who could make me happy. 
 But she was right. It was a lie. 
 You're grieving. 
 She knew me better than I know myself. 
 She was right to stay away from me. 
 No, Aramis. 
 You are brave and honourable... and kind. 
 Any woman would be fortunate to be loved by you.

 I still can't see what they're building. 
 They could be tunnelling. 
 About what you saw... 
 I didn't see anything, because I've been in here all morning, so I couldn't possibly have seen a thing, you understand? 
 These walls are too thick. 
 The garrison would be here by then. 
 I cannot believe you slept with the Queen! 
 I thought you didn't see anything. 
 They'll hang you. And then they'll hang me for letting it happen. 
 More chance we'll be killed here and take it with us to the grave. 
 That's a comfort(!) 
 So, you're good? Yeah. 
 I should get back. 
 Shout if you need me. 
 Why would I need you? 
 DOOR CREAKS 
 Your Majesty should probably wait with the nuns. 
 I want to stay here, help you. 
 Your Majesty, I don't think... 
 I am the Queen and this is my decision. 
 FAINT HAMMERING 
 Besides, surely I'm safer with you than in the care of unarmed nuns. 
 HAMMERING 
 Whenever I hear the sound of hammering, I always think of St Joseph the carpenter. 
 I doubt they're building anything a saint would approve of. 
 This is my convent, and I'm going to defend it. 
 So if there's anything more I can do to help, anything... 
 Can you load a pistol? 
 Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight... and my fingers to battle. 
 Psalms 144. 
 You load, I'll fire. 
 Simplicity, the essence of any good plan. 
 BIRDSONG 
 They WERE tunnelling. 
 Aramis! They're getting in below us! 
 We have to get the Queen somewhere we can defend her. 
 There's a storeroom in the cellar, only one way in. 
 Perfect. Quickly! 
 Wait. 
 You take the Queen. Which way? 
 That way. Go. Go, go, go. 
 I'll take care of this. 
 HE SHOUTS 
 What news of the Queen? 
 The last we heard, she was still under attack, sire. 
 Who would do this, dare to attack my Queen?! 
 A promissory note was found on one of the assassins. 
 Signed for by Count Mellendorf. 
 Search his luggage! 
 Why... Why would I want to kill the Queen?! 
 A note promising the leader of the assassins, Charles Gallagher, safe passage to Germany, on proof of the death of Queen Anne. 
 Charlotte : Father? 
 This is not mine! 
 It's... I did not write this! 
 I have never seen this before! 
 Agh! Your Majesty! 
 Your Majesty... 
 Throw them in the Bastille. 
 Mellendorf : Don't worry, my love. 
 All will be fine. 
 The Musketeers will protect Anne. 
 They will not allow any harm to come to her! 
 What would I do without her? 
 GUNFIRE PAUSES 
 I'm out. 
 How many shots do we have left? 
 HE SIGHS There's at least four of them still out there. 
 They've stopped shooting. 
 BLADE RATTLES Did I mention this has to count? 
 Thanks for the reminder. 
 Did you get him? Athos, please. 
 Our last shot. 
 If I ever complain about an assignment not being exciting enough... 
 I'll punch you so hard, you'll beg me to kick you. 
 I was going to say, "Remind me of this moment," but that works too.

 GALLAGHER GASPS AND WHEEZES 
 GROANING 
 Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. 
 GROANING 
 It seems Count Mellendorf hired them to kill the Queen, so his daughter could marry the King. 
 You have evidence of this? 
 His name is on the ledger. 
 And he was openly seeking a husband for his daughter. 
 This Gallagher is exiled from his country for being Catholic, his land stolen and given to followers of a rival faith. 
 You'd think after that, he'd have a healthy dislike of all things Protestant. 
 I know I would. Mmm. 
 Instead, he agrees to kill our Catholic Queen to allow a German Protestant to take her place on the throne. 
 It doesn't feel right. 
 He's a mercenary. 
 One with principles...of a kind. 
 Before he passed away, Monsieur Gallagher said there was money in his saddlebags to pay for the repair of the convent. 
 That's all there is. Nothing else? 
 Aramis is right, this isn't the work of Mellendorf. 
 It's something much bigger. 
 That flower is the signature of a woman who works for the Cardinal. 
 WAILING Please! Please! 
 I have done nothing wrong! 
 Nothing at all. 
 This is all some terrible misunderstanding. 
 The evidence says otherwise. 
 Forgeries. 
 I don't know any Gallagher. 
 When the Queen is attacked and almost killed, someone must answer for it. 
 Can't you help me? 
 Talk to the King! 
 It would do no good. 
 But perhaps...I could save your daughter from the rope. 
 Anne : Your Majesty. 
 I thought you were dead, and I could not countenance such a thing. 
 It's good to be home. 
 PEACOCK CRIES 
 We should confront him now. 
 Not here, and not until we are certain. 
 This woman you suspect, who is she? 
 She's the most dangerous person I've ever known. 
 She won't be easy to find. 
 Your Majesty's safe return is a cause of great rejoicing, and I have excellent news. 
 The man behind the attack on your life is in custody, pending execution. 
 Count Mellendorf signed a confession, accepting full responsibility for the attack. 
 Mellendorf... Who'd have thought it? 
 Well done, Cardinal. 
 APPLAUSE CONTINUES 
 That's it? 
 We know he's behind this and we let him stand there, the hero of the hour? 
 This isn't over yet. 
 Your Eminence, may I congratulate you on capturing the culprit? 
 I don't believe Mellendorf acted alone. 
 The assassins were hired by a woman, perhaps the woman who killed the moneylender. 
 Be assured, I will not rest until she's brought to justice. 
 Excellent. Forgive me, I'm late for Mass. 
 Her, and whoever she works for. 
 The last time I was in your bed, you murdered a man. 
 I promise I haven't murdered anyone yet...today. 
 How is Madame de la Chapelle? 
 Or is it Milady de Winter? 
 She was well last time I saw her, no thanks to her loving husband. 
 Can you kill them? 
 Musketeers don't die easily. 
 That's enough! I know what you did to your wife, Athos. 
 You've hardly changed at all, have you, Milady? 
 The question is, can I trust you? 
 D'Artagnan, help me! D'Artagnan!
