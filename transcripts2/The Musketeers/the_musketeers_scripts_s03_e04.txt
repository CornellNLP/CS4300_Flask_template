 (MOANING) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 d'Artagnan : Ahem. 
 Athos : Yes? 
 We need to, er... 
 We need to get to the Louvre. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Athos : I'm sorry. 
 What kind of a Godless brute robs the Queen of England? 
 He, he appeared from nowhere, Louis, masked and cloaked in black. 
 I tried to stop him. 
 But he showed no mercy. 
 (GROANING) 
 (SOBBING) He took everything, Louis. 
 Everything. 
 Caroline : Not everything. 
 I managed to save your most precious ring. 
 Right, mount your horses. 
 You have a thief to catch. 
 There are only four Musketeers? 
 He is fast, powerful and dangerous. 
 This is no ordinary man. 
 Why would the Queen of England travel without an escort? 
 And how are we supposed to catch this thief? 
 They didn't even give us a clear description. 
 We'll start the search in Saint Antoine. 
 The most likely place to sell stolen jewels. 
 Only an idiot would stay in Paris after robbing the king's sister. 
 Two words. Needle, haystack. 
 I've got two more. Move, now. 
 I've got two better ones. Coitus, interruptus. 
 (D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHS) 
 Athos : I heard that. 
 Athos : Porthos? 
 Porthos : I know that face. 
 Athos : Now is not the time. 
 No, no, no, no, I know it too. 
 Oh, that is not a good face. 
 That's Bonnaire. 
 Bonnaire! 
 Come here! 
 Bonnaire! 
 Come here! 
 Stop! Head him off! 
 (GEES HORSE) 
 Aramis : Other side! Other side! 
 Over there! 
 Come here! 
 Hey! 
 (SNIFFING) 
 (FLIES BUZZING) 
 Emile : Musketeers, how lovely to see you all again. 
 Emile Bonnaire, my friends, arisen from the dead. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (EMILE SCREAMING) 
 Diamonds? 
 (CHUCKLING) Me? 
 Why and how would I have come into diamonds? 
 You ran for a reason. 
 Emile : As any sane fellow would. 
 The last time our paths crossed, you threw me on a Spanish prison ship despite my having the Cardinal's blessings. 
 I will throw you off of this building! 
 Where are the diamonds? 
 I am sure that there is a better way to resolve this. 
 I say, let bygones be bygones. 
 Drop him. 
 (SCREAMS) Oh, the diamonds! You mean the diamonds? 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, now I recall, now I recall. 
 This weather is enough to freeze the blood. 
 Or perhaps it's just that basilisk stare of yours, Grimaud? 
 I have bad news. 
 (SIGHS) 
 The Cerberus is lost. 
 Your ship has sunk. 
 What? 
 Wrecked off Corsica. 
 (EXHALES ANGRILY) 
 My cargo? 
 You promised me a fortune, Grimaud. 
 I have nothing left. 
 Nothing! 
 There will be other ships. 
 It's too late! 
 (SHOUTING) I have invested everything I have in that cargo! 
 What is it? 
 What are you not telling me, Feron? 
 I have debts to settle. 
 Help me. 
 (PANTING) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Not now, Georges. 
 The Queen of England is at the Louvre. 
 She's been robbed of all her jewels. 
 London has fallen to that upstart Cromwell. 
 Troops loyal to my husband, the king, stand ready at Oxford. 
 We need help from France, Louis, from you. 
 We need weapons and supplies to begin the fight back. 
 I'm afraid, in France, we are far from immune. 
 We are protected by the love of our people. 
 Without question, Majesty. 
 Caroline : Your Majesty, the Dutch financier is on his way. 
 What are we to do? 
 We've nothing to sell him. The diamonds are all gone. 
 Feron : Perhaps I could intervene on your behalf with this financier? 
 Suggest Your Majesty has been delayed. 
 And who might you be, monsieur? 
 Henrietta Maria. Surely you recognise your own brother? 
 Half-brother. 
 It's true, I have greatly changed since last we met. 
 But Your Majesty is more beautiful now than she was on the day she left France. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 There. 
 France comes to England's aid. 
 Which is more than England has done against Spain. 
 You have my gratitude, Philippe. 
 You may meet the Dutch financier. 
 Your Majesty. 
 It must be all of six years since we last encountered one another. 
 I think we can safely say that we have all worn quite well. 
 The diamonds. 
 Yes, well, about that. 
 Look, can I have your word from one gentleman to another? (LAUGHING) 
 You, you're not a gentleman. 
 No. 
 But I am gentle. 
 So from this one gentle man to you four gentlemen, can we guarantee that upon receipt of the desired information, you're not going to toss me into the street? 
 (EXCLAIMS) 
 You sold them? Of course you did. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Man : Keep walking, Pauline. 
 Pauline? 
 Aramis? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Is that really you? 
 Pauline? 
 Aramis. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 One day, you will write your memoirs and there will be a woman's name on every page. 
 Athos : The money for the jewels. We'll take that. 
 I would love to give you the money, I would, but sadly, it is not on my person. 
 My partner, my partner has it, alas. 
 No, a dog like you has no friends. 
 Yes, but I didn't say "friends," did I? 
 Did I? I said "partner." 
 Yeah. You should, er... 
 Porthos? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Porthos. 
 We shouldn't upset this man, I'm disappointed in you. 
 Look at him, he is the equal of all four of us combined. 
 There just really is no telling what he could do. 
 Take us to the buyers, quickly. 
 The Queen of England demands it. 
 I beg your pardon? Who? 
 You robbed Louis' sister. 
 No. 
 They were royal gems? 
 Come on. Take us to the diamonds. 
 Emile : All right, all right. 
 So? 
 Come on, that woman. Who was she? 
 Someone from the first page. 
 You know a Musketeer. 
 We grew up together. 
 I haven't seen him for years. 
 And you never thought to tell me? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 A lady must always have secrets. 
 You'd grow bored of me if you knew everything. 
 That could never happen. 
 Man : Help for an old soldier? 
 Here. 
 Man : Thank you, my lady. 
 Pauline. 
 If we can, we must. 
 Athos : Much further to this buyer? 
 Emile : Not far now. 
 Anyway, as I was saying, do you know how long I was in prison for? 
 Porthos : Not long enough. 
 Emile : Five years. 
 I was tortured, they would tie my body to the rack, pull my poor limbs beyond the pale. 
 And yet, Bonnaire, you're still the same height. 
 It just pulls your bones out of your sockets, actually. 
 But, before I made my meticulously planned and daring escape, I suffered every day because you would not heed my pardon. 
 But I would like it to be known, and give me a moment because I am a touch emotional, I forgive you. 
 Yes, I do. Each and every one of you, I forgive you from the bottom of my heart. 
 Despite the many hardships I have had to endure, I find I bear you no ill will. 
 Marcheaux : Don't be alarmed, monsieur, you're quite safe. 
 Governor Feron will explain. 
 Come on. 
 Your transaction with the Queen of England is perfectly secure. 
 Her Majesty has merely been delayed by the storm. 
 She hasn't changed her mind? 
 Oh, far from it. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 You Dutch and your diamonds, hmm? 
 The crown jewels of England are a prize any merchant would covet. 
 They will be yours very soon. 
 While we await her arrival, the king has personally requested that I extend to you the very best hospitality our great city has to offer. 
 Feron : Hmm? 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Emile : That's Lady Francoise there. 
 The diamonds I sold to her were to be a gift for her darling Serena. 
 d'Artagnan : Right, so what's our plan? 
 Well, since you're the one who asked... 
 I am terribly sorry for intruding unannounced like this. 
 Oh, please, intrude. 
 Intrude. 
 Ah. 
 Good afternoon. I'm D'Artagnan. 
 Hello. 
 Lovely to meet you. Who's this? 
 Esmerelda. My youngest. 
 Esmerelda? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Right. 
 Oh. 
 Ah, of course. 
 Of course you have more than one daughter. 
 Christine. 
 Miss Christine. 
 She's not the one I... Ah. 
 Lady Francoise : Meet the feisty Rosalie. 
 Rosalie, she's not the... 
 Nice to meet you. 
 You don't happen to have any other daughters lying around in the oven... 
 Please, never mind them. 
 They are but girls. 
 Of course. I was actually looking to spend some time with Serena. 
 Hmm? 
 Serena? 
 d'Artagnan : That is Serena. 
 The diamonds have been woven into her tail. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Labourers toiling in that field and in this one, a horse wears diamonds. 
 And they wonder why civil war looms in England. 
 Stay here. 
 This won't take long. 
 (SERENA SNORTS) 
 (NEIGHING ANGRILY) 
 Ah, magnificent animal. 
 Rope. 
 Off, off, off! Go in there. 
 Go in there. Get the tail. Get the tail. 
 (HORSE NEIGHING) 
 Whoa! 
 Shh! Easy. 
 Easy. 
 Get back, get back, get back. 
 D'Artagnan, thanks for helping us out. 
 Athos : Go that way! 
 Oh, oh, oh. 
 All right, all right, all right! Oi! 
 (PANTING) Okay. 
 Let's do this. (MUTTERS) 
 Get his head that way, I'll get the tail. 
 Right. 
 I loathe this horse. 
 Aramis, shoot the horse. 
 Serena? 
 Yeah. 
 No. 
 Eh? I'm not shooting a horse. 
 (NEIGHING) 
 Athos? 
 d'Artagnan : Hey! 
 (NEIGHING) 
 d'Artagnan : Wait. 
 Give me the rope. 
 Shame on you. Shooting a horse, Athos? 
 Emile : Be careful, D'Artagnan. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 Trust me, I used to be a farmer. 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 (WHINNIES) 
 (LAUGHING) 
 You could have done that before. 
 Well, of course, but where's the fun in that? 
 Bonnaire. Grab the diamonds. 
 Me? Er... 
 Well, aren't you the fearless highwayman? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I suppose I am. 
 Pass me a blade, someone. 
 Yes, I suppose the horse's tail will just grow back, won't it? 
 But your head won't if you try anything. 
 Oh, God. Shh. 
 (GROANS) 
 (SERENA NEIGHS) 
 (LAUGHS) I thank you. 
 It's easy when you know how. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes. 
 A Musketeer's sword. 
 It's all coming back to me now. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Emile : Yeah, this is a fine piece of steel. 
 Come on, that's enough fun for one day, give it here. 
 Come on. 
 How long do you think I'd have to serve to buy Constance just one of these? 
 Well, there are other ways to keep a woman content. 
 Erm, Porthos? 
 They'll find that and put it to better use. 
 Athos : Bonnaire. 
 Bonnaire! 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Man : Come. 
 How many? 
 Rich or poor, we all deserve the same chances. 
 Liberty, equality aren't just words beloved of poets and dreamers, they should be the core of every man's life. 
 Why should a man born in a Paris backstreet not have the same chances as a man born into a palace? 
 (ALL AGREEING) 
 All : Yes! 
 Thank you. Thank you for coming. 
 Thank you. 
 You inspired me. 
 You know where to take these. 
 Yes. 
 Powerful words. 
 Oh. 
 I hope we'll see you again, monsieur? 
 What's this? 
 Assistance. 
 To use in whatever way you feel most... appropriate. 
 Thank you, but no. 
 I was like you. 
 Dragged from place to place as a child. 
 Nothing but darkness ahead. 
 And behind? (SCOFFS) 
 Chaos. 
 You fled the war? 
 Many wars. 
 My mother and I settled for a time in Eparcy, but it didn't last. 
 You fought alongside the Musketeers at the Tavern. 
 They care about the people of Paris. 
 And yet now they are chasing down diamonds for the king while you and your friends starve. 
 Yes, it made me stronger. 
 The torture, you understand, not weaker, stronger. 
 And, gentlemen, the evidence is in front of your very eyes because it takes a very strong man to realise and admit the error of his ways. 
 And lesson learned, you became a jewel thief. 
 Preying on the defenceless. 
 So no change there, then. 
 Ahem, mitigating circumstances, my friends, mitigating circumstances. 
 Some of the diamonds, take them to Treville, tell him there's more to come. 
 You'll have one of your own one day, I promise you. 
 In the meantime, go. 
 A-ha, you must be Madame D'Artagnan. 
 Which goes to show, that behind every great Musketeer, there is a beautiful and rather fabulous... 
 (GRUNTS) 
 That is for the woman you robbed. 
 And I accept your kind token with gratitude. 
 Now, pleasantries aside, I don't suppose there's anything to eat? I'm famished. 
 Get back on your horse. 
 Really rather hungry... 
 We need to find the other two buyers. 
 Erm, thank you. 
 (GRUNTS) Thank you, Porthos. 
 (STRAINING) Thank you so much. 
 Aramis! 
 Your friend looks distressed. 
 I'd feel less so if I could speak to Aramis. 
 Will it really take four Musketeers to retrieve a few diamonds? 
 Do what you have to do. 
 Fate has brought us back together. 
 Just when I need you the most. 
 (GIGGLING) 
 Majesty, the Musketeers have recovered some of your diamonds. 
 They caught the highwayman? 
 And got the better of him? 
 Treville : He isn't quite the formidable outlaw you imagined him to be. 
 This is a pitiable amount. 
 I shall need to borrow the money from you. 
 That is money for the Dauphin, have some faith. 
 Faith? England is set to burn, Louis! 
 France shall be next! 
 Settle, sister. 
 How long can the Governor distract Van Laar? 
 Feron has a talent for distraction. 
 (FERON CHUCKLING) 
 Welcome, my friend. 
 We have all evening. 
 Surely you have an appetite for food? 
 (WOMEN GIGGLING) 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 I need time to conduct my business with Van Laar, Georges. 
 Plenty of distractions, no interruptions? 
 And not the Queen of England. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Just look at us, Aramis, you, a Musketeer and I, a Lady. 
 (GIGGLING) 
 Look how far we have come, eh? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, look, you must see these gloves! 
 And this. 
 If I hold it to a candlelight. 
 There! You see? You see how it shimmers? 
 Oh, and the house, the house. You've got to see the house. 
 Well, I say house. It's more like a castle from a fairy tale. 
 Pauline. 
 You didn't come here to show me your gloves. 
 Now, they are beautiful and you have the brooch, the castle. But still... 
 Something's wrong. What is it? 
 Yes. 
 It does appear like I have everything, including a blackmailer. 
 (DOOR OPENING) 
 (GASPS) 
 Constance : I'm really sorry, I had no idea you'd still be here. 
 I needed somewhere quiet to work. 
 Constance is practically family. 
 You can speak freely. I... 
 I trust her with my life. 
 (SIGHS) 
 God, I'm in so much trouble. 
 Constance : Aramis, wine. 
 Tell me everything. 
 Well, these, er, these letters. 
 They started arriving just after my engagement to St Pierre. 
 I don't understand. What will they tell of you? 
 That I was a prostitute in the brothel that I grew up in. 
 That we grew up in. 
 My mother worked there, I lived with her till my father came to take me away. 
 I haven't seen Pauline since. 
 Your mother was... 
 Aramis : My mother. 
 She was a beautiful woman. 
 Her choices were always for the sake of her children. 
 Well, we all come from somewhere. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I fear that, for all his virtues, St Pierre may not take a similar view. 
 But won't your fiance love you regardless? 
 We can't change our pasts. 
 Yes, but I feel like my old life doesn't even exist. 
 I am... I'm a new lady. 
 I am who you see before you. 
 Do you promise you'll help me? 
 Of course he will. 
 
 
 
 Feron : Van Laar! 
 (GIRLS GIGGLE) 
 These Moroccan sweetmeats are particularly delightful. 
 No, thank you, Feron. I've had enough. 
 They are an acquired taste, I suppose. 
 What is that? 
 Want a try? 
 No? 
 Oh, come. 
 I thought you were a man of adventure? 
 Where is the queen? 
 Georges? 
 Still no news, Governor. 
 Alas. 
 There is a matter I would like to discuss with you. 
 My king is curious to know if you would consider making him a private loan. 
 Wars are expensive. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Wives are expensive. 
 (VAN LAAR CHUCKLES) 
 The queen has set her heart on a rare and exquisite necklace. 
 I'm sure you can appreciate the king cannot ask his ministers to finance such a gift at this difficult time. 
 You can be assured of my complete discretion, Governor. 
 But the rate of interest will be high. 
 Feron : Mmm. 
 d'Artagnan : Where are we going? 
 Emile : To see Monsieur Dube. 
 He is a tricky man with a short fuse. 
 Surely it would be prudent if I were to go in unaccompanied. 
 Then I can speak to him first myself, alone, make him see sense, pave the way. You understand? 
 Yes, well, we'll decide that, Bonnaire. 
 I have an idea. 
 Let us employ a code. 
 If things are going well, then I shall say nothing. 
 But if things go badly, then I shall signal to you with the words, "Well, I never did!" 
 What does that mean? 
 I've no idea. 
 The English say it all the time. 
 They don't know what it means either... 
 Oh, just get in there! 
 Trust me, my friends. 
 We're not your friends. 
 Comrades, surely? 
 Porthos : I hate him. 
 You do know he'll try to run. 
 Porthos : Good. Then we can kill him and be done with this. 
 (KNOCKS ON DOOR) 
 Hello? Ahem. 
 Hello, er, Monsieur Dube? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you, thank you so much, gentlemen. 
 Thank you. 
 Ah. 
 Dube. 
 Bonnaire? 
 Erm, the Musketeers and I... 
 We, the Musketeers, are here to take back the diamonds that I sold you. 
 And I am here to counsel you, that should you try to stand in our way, you will likely lose your head, monsieur. 
 But I... 
 I'm sorry, my hands are tied, metaphorically, tied. 
 Then I can only thank you for your warning, Emile. 
 Oh, that's ever so good of you, Dube! 
 Thank you, honour amongst thieves. 
 Not that we're thieves, erm, even... 
 Musketeers! 
 Wait there and I will give you what is rightfully yours. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Well, I never... 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Ah! 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (SHOUTING) 
 Let's see how many there are. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (FIGHTING IN THE DISTANCE) 
 Look at that. 
 There they are. 
 I paid good money for these. 
 Well, why don't you hand those over and not another word will be said. 
 Not from your lips, no. 
 Kill him, men! 
 The great D'Artagnan. 
 Killing you will greatly enhance my reputation. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (SWORD CLANKING ON FLOOR) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 All right. 
 (GASPS) 
 Fetch Aramis. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 I have seen him stitch men before. 
 Oh, it's all right, I've watched him many times. 
 You? 
 Please find me a needle. 
 Oh, for the love of God, I beseech you, I beg you. 
 No, not you, please, please. 
 Actually, I feel a lot better, I'm content to bleed. 
 As you were when you were being tortured, I imagine? 
 You will find this funny, my friends, but I... 
 Look, the fact is, as soon as you put me on that ship, I jumped overboard. 
 I have never been in Spain. 
 I have never been tortured. 
 I have been in England for five years trying not to get infested with lice. (SOBBING) 
 Please, please. 
 Go gentle with me, Porthos... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Oh, mother of God! 
 Shh, shh. 
 (SOBBING) 
 Hey, hey. 
 This is going to hurt me a lot more than it's going to hurt you, all right? 
 Really? 
 No. 
 Hold him down. 
 Good evening, Mademoiselle Boden. 
 There's a meeting later. 
 I thought you might like to come along. 
 Please? 
 You might even find the discussion interesting. 
 It would not be appropriate. 
 I can't think of anything more appropriate. 
 Show the people of Paris the Musketeers are their friends. 
 Come inside. 
 Let's drink some wine. 
 You're chasing diamonds, I heard. 
 I was chasing a thief. 
 The people I speak for don't care if some duchess loses her necklace. 
 They are having enough trouble trying to feed their children! 
 Sylvie? 
 I want to understand you, Athos. 
 I want to know who you are. 
 I can't do that if you're not willing to try and know me. 
 Or perhaps that's not what you want. 
 Perhaps. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Mademoiselle has company. 
 Yes, most enjoyable company, Corelle. 
 Pauline. 
 Ah! 
 You have brought your old friend. 
 Yes. 
 I am Aramis. 
 Pauline and I grew up together. 
 We... Our families were very close. 
 Welcome, Aramis. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm St Pierre. 
 Will you be staying for the wedding? 
 Yes, indeed. 
 Aramis has agreed to walk me down the aisle. 
 Father, brother, friend. 
 It seems you are all things to Pauline. 
 Woman : Stop! Stop her! 
 (GASPING) 
 Come back here! 
 Hey. 
 Thief! Thief! 
 That is for the wedding feast. 
 St Pierre : Give that to me. 
 (EXCLAIMS IN PAIN) 
 Come here. 
 (GASPING) 
 (WHISPERING) No. 
 Let her have what she likes. 
 Monsieur? 
 Feed her. 
 Do as monsieur says. Feed the girl! 
 Woman : Come on! 
 If we can, we must. 
 Yes. 
 Pauline : And that is why I'm marrying you today. 
 Come. 
 We need him awake. 
 Oh, perfect. Give me the water. 
 No! 
 Oh! 
 If you ever tire of being a Musketeer, Porthos, I'm sure the medical profession would welcome you with open arms. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 We only have one more diamond to find. 
 Yes, a blue one, worth a king's ransom. 
 So wake him up, or I will. 
 (SIGHS) 
 God forgive me. 
 (SCREAMS IN PAIN) 
 Porthos : The blue diamond? 
 Oh, God. 
 Aramis : I thought this was going to be difficult. 
 A mystery. 
 A game of cat and mouse. 
 But there you were. 
 Feel free to tell me I'm mistaken, but whoever sent these has a serious problem. 
 Namely me. 
 I don't hold with blackmail. 
 But, this could end here. 
 Peacefully, without recourse. 
 But I know of her past. 
 That was a different time, a different life. 
 I know that, and you know that, but do you really think others will be so liberally minded? 
 Let me worry about the others. 
 St Pierre is in love. 
 You have walked through palaces. 
 Pauline and St Pierre will be destroyed by it. 
 I have to protect him. 
 Pauline means more to me than you could possibly imagine. 
 I will protect her. 
 Then do so. 
 Oh, God. 
 You're not going to hit me again, are you? 
 You're in no danger, so long as you behave. 
 Though, I can't understand why they haven't just thrown you in prison. 
 Well, if I am to have a jailer, then you would be my preferred choice. 
 You would, because I like strong women. 
 Actually, you remind me very much of my first wife. 
 Maria, God rest her soul. 
 Yes, I, er, I keep her as close as I am able. 
 She is my charm, my luck, my protection. 
 I'm not really a thief. Not really. 
 Of course you're not. 
 No, no, I'm not. 
 I'm an apothecary. 
 Now, I was a gardener who happened to fall in love. 
 I vowed this time that I would keep my woman safe from harm. 
 By stealing the Queen of England's diamonds? 
 Which shows how madly in love I am. 
 Just as you must be with D'Artagnan. 
 You know, it's a shame you didn't use your charm and wit more wisely, Bonnaire. 
 You could have been somebody. 
 Oh, wait, wait, we were having a nice... 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (CHAIN BREAKING) 
 Hmm. 
 For me? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, could you imagine if they could see us now. 
 Those other girls, can you imagine the looks on their faces? 
 My mother on the other hand, she would have loved to be at your wedding. 
 She would have probably cried. 
 Definitely cried. 
 Definitely cried. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 You know she gave you up for a better life. 
 You must remember that. 
 No mother could do more for her son. 
 I thought of you often. 
 You have? 
 I should have taken you with me. 
 My father never told me she'd died until years later. 
 So many lies, Pauline. 
 Would it be so bad if you told St Pierre the truth? 
 Why build a wall of lies between you and those you love? 
 Apologies, Aramis, may I steal her away? 
 St Pierre : I have a wedding gift for you. 
 This will go on my finger. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 But... this... is to go on yours. 
 (GASPS) 
 Monsieur, a word please? 
 More Musketeers? 
 On royal business. 
 Yes, we need you to give up a certain blue diamond. 
 St Pierre : I will do nothing of the kind. 
 It won't be of any great loss to you financially. 
 Money is not the issue here. 
 Pauline : Aramis? 
 Do not despair, Pauline. They will not take it from you. 
 Rest assured we will. 
 Can you do something? 
 What is one more diamond? 
 Gentlemen, take your leave. 
 When we have what we came for. 
 I said take your leave. 
 Monsieur, we are not here to stop you getting married. 
 Trust me, nothing will stop that. 
 St Pierre! 
 There must be another solution here. 
 Monsieur, stand down. 
 Ah, really? 
 Really. 
 Aramis. 
 You know I hate following orders. 
 Then don't make me give you one. 
 Then lower your pistol! 
 I never ask three times. Not of anyone. 
 Fine. Here. 
 There. Take it, if it means that much to you. 
 That was enjoyable. 
 So, did you shoot him? 
 No. 
 No, Aramis is my penance. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Yeah, mine too. 
 I need your word you won't stop this wedding. 
 Corelle? 
 I have some thoughts that I'd like to share with you. 
 Well, Aramis has warned you, has he not? 
 Mademoiselle, some things are not changeable. 
 You have to leave. 
 Ah. 
 So you, you won't heed his caution then. 
 As you failed to heed mine. 
 I will saddle you a horse. 
 Corelle... 
 If you truly loved him, you will do this. 
 (GASPS) 
 Yes. 
 Well, the thing is... 
 I do love him. 
 I'm ready, I'm ready! 
 Ah, my dashing Aramis. 
 Are you ready to walk me down the aisle? 
 What? 
 (GASPS) 
 It's nothing, it's nothing. 
 Pauline... 
 Aramis, please. I'm different, please. 
 Look at me, I'm someone new. 
 I am wearing a silk dress! 
 Please, please, I want this life so much, please, I need this! 
 (SOBBING) St Pierre! 
 (LAUGHING) Marry me! 
 Will you marry me now? 
 Aramis? 
 (SOBBING) 
 I... I... 
 Pauline... 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Bonnaire has escaped! 
 Find him! Go! 
 I was growing so, so nervous with worry. 
 Dear friends, did you find the diamond? 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Thank... 
 Make one move! 
 (GROANS) 
 Your Majesty, your diamond and your thief. 
 My gardener? 
 Forgive me, ma'am. 
 I am a thief, but I am also the principal agent in the jewels' return. 
 Hang him! 
 I could double your money for you. 
 Hang him now! 
 Double your money. 
 Surely if he could accomplish that, ma'am. 
 Don't trust him, every breath is a lie. 
 He must have the money he made from the sales. 
 Yes, yes, I do! 
 Now you have the diamonds back, you might sell them... again. 
 Thereby all but doubling your money. 
 We'd better send for your partner then. 
 Partner? 
 He has a partner. 
 And the partner has the money. 
 Henrietta : There shall be no bargaining. 
 Give me your sword and I will execute him myself. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Double the money means double the arms for soldiers. 
 And I for one would like to see you win your war, Henrietta Maria. 
 He betrayed me. 
 Hmm. 
 And yet, he has the means to keep England safe. 
 Show me this partner. 
 (SOBBING) I fear that is something I cannot do. 
 Give me your sword! 
 Emile, you fool! 
 Caroline, it is you who are the fool, my love. 
 What have you done? 
 This was my plan, my idea. 
 I was only trying to make a better life for my wife. 
 Henrietta : You're married? 
 Without my permission? 
 Hang me twice over, but not Caroline. 
 (EMILE SNIFFLES) 
 Please, I beg of you. 
 She kept your favourite ring. 
 That was her idea, not mine. 
 Bonnaire, do you have the money? 
 I do. It lies hidden. 
 Musketeers, take him and retrieve it. 
 Louis! 
 Look. 
 Don't let your anger outwit your good sense. 
 (SOBBING) 
 I petition the queen! 
 I demand immunity from prosecution. 
 You demand? 
 Petition to demand. 
 Not a penny crosses anyone's palm till you let Caroline walk free and me with her. 
 Agreed. 
 But you shall never set foot in England again. 
 I can promise you, ma'am, that will never happen. 
 God save you! 
 God save you! 
 (SOBBING) 
 (FLIES BUZZING) 
 (COUGHING) 
 Down amongst the dead men. 
 d'Artagnan : Look at it all. 
 You could live like a king. 
 Caroline : What of us? 
 We have the Queen's pardon, Caroline. 
 But not theirs. 
 Who would know if we ended up in this grave? 
 Are we doing this? 
 Comrades? 
 Athos : Don't push it. 
 d'Artagnan : As much as it pains me to say, he did save my life. 
 Aramis : Assuming he wasn't aiming at you. 
 Athos : Porthos? 
 Emile : Well, that's settled then. 
 Wonderful. 
 Erm, gentlemen, it remains for me to say... 
 All for one... 
 Yeah, well... 
 Let's go. 
 Grimaud : You got your money then? 
 No one ever hears you coming, do they, Grimaud? 
 You're like a serpent in the night. 
 I have resolved my problem without your help this time. 
 Tell me what is going on, Feron. 
 The king is dying. 
 The white plague eating away at his lungs. 
 That is excellent news. 
 Hmm. Is it? 
 Erm, I find myself troubled. 
 You see, I know how it feels to be halfway in the grave, to almost taste the dirt in one's mouth. 
 The dirt will have to wait a long time for me. 
 Hmm. 
 I hope so for your sake. 
 God will certainly not look upon us with kindness. 
 I see no God in this cesspit of an earth. 
 The thought that Louis will leave this world before me is strange. 
 Very, very strange. 
 We will take advantage of this? 
 Oh, of course. 
 The game is everything and you and I must continue to play it. 
 Now is the time to bring Gaston and his allies to heel. 
 Mmm. 
 We need to pay for an army. 
 All that is in hand, Lucien. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Listen to this... 
 I have a very audacious plan to suggest to you...
