 Forward! 
 [SHOUTING] 
 [GUNFIRE] 
 Retreat! 
 Retreat! 
 Retreat! 
 Go! 
 Go, come on! 
 The artillery has no powder, no ammunition. 
 Second battalion is gone. 
 We've got nothing left to throw at them. 
 [HORSE WHINNIES] 
 Hold your position. 
 Where are you going? 
 Athos! 
 [GUNFIRE] 
 What the devil are you doing here? 
 Get back to your men. 
 My men have been butchered. 
 You're sending sword against cannon. 
 You will hold the line at all cost, Captain. 
 We have to take the field. 
 Our cannon are useless. 
 Where is the powder we were promised? 
 The supply wagon did not arrive. 
 You will have to advance without artillery support. 
 There won't be a man left alive. 
 You are soldiers, the king's own regiment. 
 Now, go out there and die for him. 
 That is your strategy? 
 To watch good men slaughtered? 
 Return to your men, Captain, or I will have you court-martialed. 
 [GASPS] 
 Grimaud. Impossible. You can't be here. 
 I will get you your money, I swear it! 
 You think you can hide from me? 
 Even on the battlefield, I will find you. 
 [SCREAMING] 
 The only way out of here is to take out that cannon. 
 We need a plan. 
 Attack. 
 What? 
 I hate it when he does that. 
 Attack! 
 ♪ 
 Powder! 
 Shoot the powder! 
 There. 
 You can see the troops moving. 
 The battle's over. 
 You see the banner there? 
 A French victory. 
 [CHEERING] 
 Who will you be, Marie? 
 Porthos. 
 Oh, I'll be D'Artagnan. 
 You won't kill me with my armour on. 
 I told you not to come this way. 
 We wanted to see the battle. 
 War is not a game. 
 Everyone, gather round. Come here. 
 Drop your stick, Marie. 
 Come here. We're leaving. 
 What's that? 
 It's my fleur-de-lis. I'm a musketeer. 
 When we get back, you're taking that off. 
 Don't talk to me like I'm a child. 
 Then don't behave like one. 
 Come, we're late for your lessons, come on. 
 How could you ever understand? You're only a monk. 
 [CROW CAWING] 
 What's wrong? 
 A man, a figure. 
 Only the crows have any business down there. 
 [CROWS CAWING] 
 I'd give anything to be back in Paris right now. 
 [GRUNTING] 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Ooh! 
 [SCREAMING] 
 Finish him! 
 You want to fight so badly, I can send you to the fronts. 
 Isn't there enough violence and brutality in the world without this? 
 Clairmont, why have you come here? 
 A little innocent amusement, Minister Treville, nothing more. 
 Feron. 
 I should have guessed you were behind this. 
 Come now, the Red Guard and the Musketeers have always maintained a healthy rivalry. 
 These are cadets, and you pit them against trained soldiers. 
 That one really does need a little more training. 
 Run along, boy! 
 Hide inside the skirts of Madam D'Artagnan. 
 Being governor of Paris does not give you the right to treat the Red Guard as your own personal thugs. 
 Terrorizing, persecuting the people. 
 We are at war, Treville. 
 This city breeds insurrection, revolution. 
 The Red Guard are all that stands between us and anarchy. 
 Now, why don't you take your infant Musketeer, go home and tuck him in nicely? 
 It must be near his bed time. 
 Come on. 
 [MEN JEERING] 
 What's next?! 
 General! 
 What do you want here? 
 Hey. 
 We just lost half our regiment because we didn't get the support that we were promised. 
 Good men wasted. Where's the general? 
 You don't understand. I don't know, sir. 
 He sent me for the maps so that we could trace the route of the artillery supplies, then he just rode off with someone. 
 A soldier? 
 No, he did not leave of his own volition. 
 Show us. 
 The weapons transport was last reported on the road from Douai. 
 The general rode in that direction. 
 Not all of him. 
 Find some horses. 
 Stop! No further! 
 General Lantier. What are you doing here, sir? 
 We have the powder consignment. We broke a wheel on the road. 
 General, you're injured. 
 Salute a superior officer! 
 And the rest of you! Do as I say! 
 [GUNFIRE] 
 Take cover! 
 Don't move. 
 There you are, Luc! 
 Excuse us, gentlemen. 
 I'm sorry if the children's play has disturbed you. 
 We must get back to the monastery. 
 Hold! 
 They're so young and excitable. 
 I found him, children! 
 Never pay attention to anything that goes on around them. 
 They see nothing. 
 Good day. 
 Look straight ahead. Don't run. 
 Slowly now. 
 For God's sake. 
 I've done what you wanted. 
 Take the weapons, sell them. 
 The monastery must be close. 
 We hide the powder there until I contact the Spanish buyers at the border. 
 We should leave the monastery immediately for the sake of the children. 
 The children, yes. 
 It is past the hour for their lessons, brother. 
 With the greatest of respect, Abbott, you do not realize the danger. 
 Those men were not soldiers. 
 What I saw on the road was cold-blooded murder. 
 We cannot protect ourselves here, not alone. 
 We are never alone, brother. 
 We have the best protection in the world. 
 God watches over us. 
 I have seen violent men like this before. 
 You live too much in the world and in your own past. 
 I have given my life to God. 
 Yet you tend your beard as another might a rose bush. 
 And here you are speaking like a soldier again. 
 Abbott, forgive me, but you do not understand. 
 I think I do. 
 I've become very fond of you over these past few years, Aramis. 
 Your company pleases me... but your soul is as restless and confused as it was on the day that you arrived here. 
 You've been looking for something you may never find in a life of contemplation. 
 If these men come here, then we shall welcome them with God's love. 
 His will be done. 
 Now, tend to your charges. 
 [BANGING] 
 Open the gates. 
 Come, brothers, open the gates. 
 We seek shelter, brother. 
 We were attacked on the road. 
 You are welcome. 
 Let them in, brothers. 
 I do not understand. 
 You said you were attacked. 
 Have you any wounded? 
 What is the meaning of this deception? 
 Open the gates! 
 [GUNS COCKING] 
 Stand aside. 
 I will do it myself. 
 Get back inside. 
 Detain the friars in the chapel. 
 If any resist, kill them. 
 Bring the general to me. 
 Push, push, push. 
 Good boy, there we are. 
 So, did we all understand? 
 Right, move, move, move. 
 Go, go. 
 Are we coming back? 
 Of course we will. 
 Come here, come here. Give me your hat. 
 Come here. 
 Give me your jacket. Come on. 
 There you are. 
 My favourite part of the battle is always its end. 
 When there's only the dead left... with their secrets. 
 [CUP CLATTERS] 
 That's when the real struggle starts. 
 Fight for the spoils. 
 Now, General... are you spoils, or just one of the dead? 
 I am not going to beg for mercy of you. 
 You are no more than Paris street trash. 
 [SCREAMING] 
 [SCREAMING ECHOING] 
 So, do we remember the games of hide and go seek we sometimes play? 
 We're going to play one of those games right now. 
 But we all have to be very, very quiet. Shh. 
 I don't got my shoes. 
 Don't worry about your shoes. I've got your shoes. Come on. 
 Everyone, this way. 
 See if there's any monks hiding in this upper rooms. 
 This way, go, go. 
 Get a move on! 
 Get every single one of them into the chapel. 
 Come on, move! 
 Where is Luc? 
 I don't know. 
 Take the children that way. 
 Here. Stop. 
 Adele, hide them behind the barrels. 
 Take them all. Take them. 
 This wasn't an ambush, it was an execution. 
 [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] 
 Sounds like trouble. 
 Hyah, hyah! 
 [TOLLING CONTINUES] 
 Get him! 
 Where is he? Search the place. Find him! 
 Get more men! Look in the cellars! 
 Pierre, get back! 
 Hey. 
 Try this. 
 Not bad, eh? 
 Good drop. 
 Come on. 
 
 
 
 Help! 
 Help us! Help! 
 Wait there! Halt! 
 Please, quickly. 
 Help. 
 Shh. 
 The men who killed the soldiers have taken the monastery. 
 The abbott's dead. 
 All right. 
 Can you show us the way? 
 Good boy. 
 Shouldn't we report back what we found here? 
 It's our duty as soldiers. 
 We're also Musketeers. 
 The bell. Who rang the bell? 
 The boy we saw on the road earlier. 
 He got away. Should have finished him then. 
 Put men outside the walls. 
 No one else escapes. 
 Bring my horse around. 
 I'll ride out to meet the Spanish buyers at the border. 
 Who's there? 
 Show yourself! 
 Stop! Stop! Not him! 
 This is... 
 Aramis. We know. 
 This is not possible. 
 You still have that knack of getting into trouble, brother. 
 Porthos. 
 Your name's Porthos? 
 After the hero in the stories? 
 Stories? 
 I was named after my mother's father. 
 You were 'the' Porthos? 
 The Porthos. 
 This is the the Athos... and the... D'Artagnan. 
 The stories were true? 
 Our reputation precedes us. 
 God moves in mysterious ways. 
 Not that mysterious. 
 We've been stationed in the valley below in a little thing called the war. 
 We know all about the war here. 
 Especially these little ones. 
 Children, come out. Meet my friends. 
 Now we just need to get them to safety. 
 Now, look ahead, keep looking ahead, that's it. 
 The Dauphine grows older and the king reverts to the nursery. 
 I sometimes wonder which Louis is the child. 
 Oh, damnation. 
 Can you help me? 
 Here you are. 
 You all right? 
 Thank you. 
 I'm afraid... 
 I have a touch of the family disease. 
 My crumbling Bourbon spine. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't worry. 
 Louis was blessed to escape your father's illness. 
 Louis was always blessed. 
 His mother was Marie de Medici. 
 My mother was a chamber maid. 
 Well, not exactly a chamber maid. 
 Lady in waiting, but you know what I mean. 
 The question of your birth never bothered the king. 
 He has a generous spirit. 
 More sober council has advised him to disown you. 
 But... he is very fond of you. 
 You know, sometimes you don't look Spanish at all. 
 Sometimes you don't look like a b*st*rd. 
 We must really do this more often. 
 So, that's what happened to our gun powder. 
 Open the gate. 
 That's the man I saw on the battlefield. 
 We need to get everyone out of here. 
 They might be going for reinforcements. 
 Keep watch outside the wall. Nobody leaves. 
 We wait until dark. 
 If we can keep the children hidden until then, we stand a chance. 
 Hello. Aramis! 
 What is it? 
 [WHISPERING] 
 Well, let's ask him. 
 She wants to know if you're a giant. 
 I won't eat you because I'm not hungry... yet. 
 Hey! 
 I think she likes you. 
 She's got a funny way of showing it. 
 It's good to see you again, my friend. 
 It's been too long. That wasn't my choice. 
 I could not go to war with you, Porthos. 
 We were comrades. 
 I never had to worry what was behind me because you... you had my back. 
 I made a promise to God... a vow to myself. 
 What about your vow to us? 
 One for all. What about that? 
 Four years is a long time. 
 We learned to live without you. 
 Constance, you asked for me? What's the urgency? 
 Well, I think you're going to be needing this. 
 What are you up to now? 
 Luc, children, we're leaving. 
 I'll go through first. 
 When I pull on the string, send the first one through. 
 Come on, look away. 
 Now. 
 Luc, you go first, help the children to the other side. 
 We're going one at a time. 
 Are we friends now? 
 Shh. 
 Marcheaux and the Red Guard regularly use the old bath house. 
 They can drink and gamble there all night, amongst other things. 
 Constance, I am a minister of the Crown. 
 Well, for one night you can be a Musketeer again. 
 We're going to show Feron and his Red Guards we're not to be humiliated. 
 [CHANTING] 
 We're moving. Up. Up. 
 This way. 
 You're next. 
 You will follow? 
 We have matters to attend to here. 
 The gun powder must not fall into the wrong hands. 
 Head for the mountains. We will find you. 
 Your brothers are waiting. 
 [MEN LAUGHING] 
 Fire! Fire! 
 Over here! This way! 
 This way! Quickly, quickly! 
 [MEN SHOUTING] 
 Not so cocky now, are we? 
 Minister Treville. 
 What's this about? 
 Captain, in the future, pick on somebody your own size. 
 Children, stay in line. 
 The path gets difficult here. 
 Why didn't you tell me the stories you told us were true? 
 And you were one of them, a Musketeer! 
 I renounced that life when I joined the monastery. 
 And now? 
 Pierre, don't throw things. Keep them quiet. 
 Don't do that. 
 They've escaped! 
 They can't have gone far. 
 Get the horses on the wagon. 
 The Spanish buyers are on their way. 
 Clean yourself up. 
 Treville is a disgrace to France. 
 What kind of soldier would put that woman in charge of the garrison mess? 
 Perhaps he is warming her bed while her idiot husband is away at war. 
 There is something unnatural about that bitch. 
 She has the cunning of the devil. 
 Come here. 
 And yet... you have let her turn the Red Guard... into a laughing stock. 
 That undermines my authority, George. 
 It cannot happen again. 
 Luc, Luc, hide the children in there. 
 Brothers, hide yourself. Keep moving. 
 Wherever you can. Quickly, go on. 
 Go, go, spread out. 
 You did very well. Now, shh, stay quiet, okay? 
 Go in there. Hide in there. 
 Stay with the children. 
 You're their protector now. 
 What are you going to do? 
 Come here! 
 Get away from the children! 
 Get off me! Get off me! Aramis! 
 Stay away from her! 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 Don't move. 
 I'll kill him. 
 So, the man of God was once a soldier. 
 You've been wearing a cassock too long. 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 Luc! 
 You really are a Musketeer. 
 A bit rusty right now. 
 I'm not so sure I want to be a soldier anymore. 
 Open the gates! The Spanish are here! 
 Musketeers! 
 [GUNFIRE] 
 Porthos, stop him! Take the wagon! 
 Spanish soldiers. 
 They cannot be allowed to get that gun powder. 
 Whoa! 
 Do you need help with that? 
 Just shoot straight. 
 [GUNFIRE] 
 It's about to get hot! 
 Are you going to try and tell me that you didn't enjoy that? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Thank you for all you've done. 
 You be good now, all right? 
 Look after the brothers. 
 Yes, I will. 
 So, you think we'll need three or four horses? 
 I thought I understood your plan. 
 Now you... seem to be showing me another path. 
 In the middle of all the danger and excitement today, you were closer to me than at any time in all my years here. 
 I've never felt so... alive. 
 This is what you made me. 
 A Musketeer. 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
 You are many things, Aramis... but a monk is not one of them. 
 You can't argue with God. 
 [SHUDDERING] 
 Lucien. 
 I have what you want. 
 Where have you been? We needed you. 
 Calm yourself. 
 The plans were ruined by interfering Musketeers. 
 Careful! Careful! 
 Drink it down and it'll all be better. 
 [SOBBING] 
 I can't live with the pain. 
 Let the medicine work. 
 There. 
 Better now? 
 You can never leave me again. 
 I have everything I need in Paris. 
 I need these ordinances sent over to the military supply depot at Bagneux immediately. 
 I'll need a fresh horse. 
 It was a very long ride. 
 Athos. 
 I had no idea. You should have sent word. 
 Porthos. Minister. 
 Aramis. You came back to us. 
 It seems I never really went away. 
 D'Artagnan? He's not...? 
 No, he, uh, had some important business to attend to at the garrison. 
 Who's that? The Marquis de Feron. 
 Governor of Paris, Commander of the Red Guard. 
 Ah, Treville. 
 I see you have found some grown-up Musketeers at last. 
 Governor, you haven't met Porthos... 
 Athos, Aramis. 
 Ah, the war heroes. 
 Not quite as impressive in the flesh. 
 But then, legends tend to exaggerate everything, even courage. 
 You will be seeing a great deal more of the captain and his men, Feron. 
 They are to be stationed here in Paris. 
 Effective immediately. 
 Not returning to the front? 
 Perhaps it's for the best. 
 We need men in their prime fighting for France, not worn-out dregs. 
 The world has changed since you've been away. 
 Paris is my city now. 
 Cross me and you'll live to regret it.
