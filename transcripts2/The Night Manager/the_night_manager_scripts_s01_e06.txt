 Permanent Secretary : Aside from the money wasted, and the embarrassment to our American friends, the debacle at the Turkish-Syrian border has put us back five years in terms of intelligence sourcing with Syria and the Middle East. 
 I'm extending the meeting so we can fully explore the reasons why the operation went ahead with such poor and corrupted intelligence, and what lessons can be learnt to ensure this never happens again. 
 What led you to believe that British arms were being exported under the counter through TradePass? 
 I was shown fake MOD end user certificates for seven different arms companies, UK and US. 
 Do you mean these? 
 Yes. 
 Those are genuine MOD export certificates for Bulgaria and Italy. 
 That's not true. 
 I have signed letters from both Italian and Bulgarian governments confirming the sales. 
 (CHUCKLES) This is a cover up. 
 Angela, are you accusing me of lying? 
 Permanent Secretary : I spoke to Rex Mayhew during his handover, before he joined the Royal Commission. 
 He said that you persuaded someone to leak information from the River House. 
 Someone you referred to as the Boatman? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 I've never heard of such a name. 
 Dromgoole : Then how did you get hold of those certificates? 
 They're classified documents. 
 An angel gave them to me. 
 With a halo. 
 You do understand the seriousness of this enquiry, Ms Burr? 
 Let us now move on to the arms swoop itself. 
 Based on what we now know to be flawed intelligence, you authorised, through an American Enforcement connection, and behind the FCO's back, a full US military raid on 20 aid trucks crossing the Turkish-Syrian border. 
 Rex Mayhew authorised it. Not me. 
 Permanent Secretary : On his last day. 
 And on your cast-iron guarantee that the intelligence was solid. 
 Where did you get this intelligence? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 A source close to TradePass and Richard Roper. 
 Can you be more specific? 
 (BURR CHUCKLES) 
 To do so would be to put lives at risk. No, I can't do that. 
 Mmm, this is a behind-closed-doors enquiry, Ms Burr. 
 Names will be redacted from the records. So, why can't you tell us? 
 You know why. 
 You all know why. 
 They pulled out this morning. 
 Order from the Ministry. 
 So it's just you and me again then, is it? 
 Not even that, I'm afraid. 
 Two weeks and they close the office. 
 The International Enforcement Agency is officially mothballed. 
 Go home, Angela. 
 Have your baby. 
 Be a teacher's wife. 
 You mean give up? What about Pine? 
 Pine gave you false intelligence. 
 I don't believe that. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 I went to him. I got him involved in this. I can't just leave him in there. 
 I don't see what choice you have. 
 Oh, didn't you hear? You don't work here any more. 
 I just wanted to say thank you. 
 (MOBILE RINGING) 
 And if you ever needed help in the future. 
 Ah, well, don't hold your breath. 
 Angela Burr. 
 Who is this? 
 Jonathan :  Yes, is Sophie there, please? 
 Sophie? No there isn't a... 
 Well, when she comes, could you tell her we're all here. At the same hotel. Tell her we're all here. 
 He's in Cairo. 
 (IN DISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Mr Roper, your courier has arrived. I'll send him up. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (KEYPAD BEEPING) 
 (MUEZZIN CALLING) 
 Roper : You ever been to Cairo before? 
 No, erm... 
 I've spent some time in Morocco and Tunisia, but this is my first time in Egypt. 
 Well, you should take advantage. 
 See the sights while we're off down the Nile. 
 Andrew isn't coming with us? 
 Absolutely not. 
 You and I are going to be very busy. 
 (SOFTLY) Why, Richard Roper, I do declare... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Speaking of true love... 
 What's she doing here? 
 Thought you might want some female company. 
 Jonathan : Caroline. 
 Look who's back. 
 Caro, lovely to see you. 
 Thank you. 
 Morning, Sandy. 
 Morning. 
 Hi, darling. 
 Great to see you. 
 Er, listen, I just need a few minutes with the young prince here, so why don't you girls go and lay waste to the local bazaar? 
 Fine, baby. 
 Tabby, would you? 
 Caroline : See you later. 
 Jonathan : See you later. 
 Coffee? 
 Thank you. 
 You know what this reminds me of? 
 Winston Churchill and TE Lawrence in a Cairo hotel dividing up the Middle East over champagne and a cigar. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Drew a map on a napkin and shook hands. 
 Kings of Arabia. 
 I'm guessing that you're Churchill in this scenario. 
 If you insist. 
 Damn shame about Corky, though. 
 I feel as if... 
 If I'd known, I could probably have talked him round. 
 Could have explained that even traitors can be forgiven. 
 Actually be pretty useful. 
 Keep tabs on the enemy. Blow smoke in their face. 
 But they have to commit, that's the thing. 
 Have to make a decision. 
 I don't know why I'm telling you this. 
 You've already made your decision, haven't you? 
 A long time ago. 
 Kings of Arabia. 
 Freddie Hamid, how are you? 
 Freddie : Hello, sir. 
 Roper : Good to see you. 
 May I introduce Andrew Birch, our director. 
 Pleasure to meet you, Freddie. Dickie's told me lots about you. 
 Welcome to Cairo. 
 Thank you. 
 It's going to be fun. 
 Oh, I can't wait. 
 Well. Shall we? 
 (CHATTER IN ARABIC) 
 Roper : Mr Kouyami. 
 East is East and West is West. 
 And never the twain shall meet. 
 Good to see you, Mr Roper. 
 Roper : After you. 
 So, spec list, not changed? 
 Jonathan : It's all there, sir. 
 The consignment's being held in a secure military zone on the outskirts of the city. 
 Ready for collection. 
 And the payment structure? 
 As discussed. Half now and half on exchange. 
 We'll meet again in 48 hours' time. 
 Sandy : Then, if all parties are satisfied, I suggest we sanction the first half of the payment to be made to the TradePass account. 
 Wait. 
 We had report of an incident involving US military at the Syrian border. 
 I want your reassurance that there is no risk attached to this transaction. 
 Can you give this assurance, Mr Roper? 
 We had a minor issue. 
 Internal. 
 It's been investigated and addressed. 
 You have my word. 
 Let us proceed. 
 (BEEPS) 
 (BEEPS) 
 It's done. 
 (SANDY CHUCKLING) 
 Thank you. 
 Congratulations. 
 Congratulations. 
 (SINGING IN ARABIC) 
 (IN DISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Who needs another drink? 
 Oh, not for me. 
 Smile at me. Laugh. 
 Tell me a joke then. 
 (BOTH CHUCKLING) 
 I can't do this any more, Jonathan. 
 I can't. I can't sleep with him another night. 
 You have to. 
 Why can't we go away? Just the two of us. Now. 
 It isn't just about you and me. 
 (CHUCKLES) Funny, funny joke. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 A courier came last night. 
 Delivered papers about the shipment. 
 They're in the safe. 
 Do you know the combination? 
 I'll get it for you. 
 Be careful. 
 Excuse me, sir, could I have a vodka martini, please? 
 (MUEZZIN CALLING) 
 (BREATHING DEEPLY) 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 You're up early. 
 We're going shopping. 
 You can't have too many rugs, apparently. 
 Right. 
 Look at you. 
 Quite the Roper acolyte. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 How things change. 
 Yes, they do, don't they? 
 Me? Oh, I'm the prodigal wife brought to heel. Didn't you hear? 
 Brought to heel by what? 
 Roper made me an offer. 
 Let bygones be bygones and return to the fold. 
 Very... Very decent of him. 
 That may be. 
 Or maybe he just wanted someone to spy on his girlfriend. 
 Careful, Caro. 
 Sun's hot out there. 
 Caro, is that true? 
 He said if I didn't agree, I'd never see the children again. 
 I hate him. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) Message from London. 
 (JONATHAN CHUCKLES) 
 I didn't expect you to come. 
 Burr : Oh, ye of little faith. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Actually, it was me that took some persuading. 
 I don't know who you are. 
 Burr : Oh, sorry. 
 Joel Steadman, American Enforcement Agency. 
 Pine. 
 And I think you might be playing both sides. 
 Wait. What are you talking about? What is this? 
 There was a leak. 
 The leak was at your end, not mine. 
 I killed a man to patch it. 
 Corkoran? 
 Jonathan, if you want to get out now, I can get you out. 
 No. 
 There is still time left... 
 You don't want that and nor do I. We're so close. 
 I don't have an organisation any more. 
 I've got no recourse to troops. 
 No international enforcement support. 
 Just a cowboy and a pregnant woman. That's your army. 
 Jonathan, if things go wrong, I can't guarantee I can get you out. 
 I was living half a life when you met me. 
 I've got nothing to lose. 
 But I will need your help. 
 OK. 
 What can we do? 
 (CHATTER IN ARABIC) 
 Yalla,  one mixed salad. 
 Erm, I'm looking for someone called Youssef. 
 That's me. 
 I hear you're a good man to speak to about a recipe for, um, tourli. 
 Tourli? 
 Tourli. 
 We can speak about that? 
 You want to speak about tourli? 
 Yes. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Wait. 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 How are you? 
 Jonathan, you look great. Look at you. 
 Oh, come on, look at you, Mr Head Chef. 
 You got the hat and everything. 
 Are you serious? Look at your watch. 
 Oh, come on... 
 How much is this, huh? 
 Come on, it's just a watch. 
 How are you? 
 What happened to you? You just disappeared. 
 I know. I know. 
 And how is your Arabic, eh? 
 You remember everything I taught you? 
 Ah, it's a little rusty. I am... I am practising. 
 Your brother, Akhmed. He's well? 
 Is he still active? 
 What do you mean, still active? 
 Come on, you know what I mean. 
 His people had their moment and they screwed it up. 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 I need to talk to him. 
 OK. 
 How was shopping? 
 Did you get me some of those curly slippers? 
 No, I tried. 
 Apparently, Egyptian men have tiny little feet. 
 Well, you know what they say? 
 Tiny feet, tiny shoes. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 It is good to have Caro back, though. She's fun. 
 Maybe she and Sandy should come to Luxor, too. 
 Oh, no. 
 (IN FRENCH ACCENT) That is for the lovers. 
 Baby, I got these new silver earrings at this souk. 
 Could you put them in the safe for me? 
 I don't feel comfortable leaving them out. 
 Not all Arabs are thieves, darling. 
 I didn't mean that. 
 We always use the safe when we're... 
 I'm joking. 
 They are all thieves. Give 'em here. 
 (SAFE WHIRRING AND BEEPING) 
 Anything unusual happen today? 
 Oh, yes. 
 What? 
 I've never been to Cairo, Sandy. 
 I've never been to Egypt. It's all unusual. 
 You know what I mean. 
 Ah, Andrew. 
 Feeling lucky? 
 Very. 
 Caro. 
 Dickie. 
 Right. Well, let's go and roll some dice. 
 (ROPER CLAPS) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Jed meet with anybody? 
 Make a phone call? 
 Nothing at all. 
 I don't know why he's so suspicious. She's just a silly girl. 
 Except if she isn't just a silly girl, that may be exactly how she wants to appear. 
 Did you think about that? 
 No. 
 I don't have to think like that. That's your world. 
 My world pays for your world. 
 Don't you forget it. 
 Sandy : You can keep Luxor, Dickie. 
 This is a temple. 
 Roper : You are an inspiration to us all, Sandy. 
 Sandy : I am. 
 (IN DISTINCT CHATTER) 
 You married? 
 Uh, no. 
 I am married. 
 Right. 
 You want me to sort out a girl for you? 
 Easily done. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 (CHUCKLES) Thank you. It's, er... 
 It's fine. Thank you for the offer. 
 I feel like we have met before. 
 Is that possible? 
 Erm... 
 I don't think so. Er, it's unlikely. 
 (ROULETTE WHEEL SPINNING) 
 Je suis un gagneur! 
 I'm gonna play some roulette. Anyone else? 
 Sure. 
 Good idea. 
 See which of us is the lucky one. 
 This one over here. 
 Madame. 
 Jonathan : Yes. 
 (CROUPIER SPEAKING FRENCH) 
 Good luck, darling. 
 Thank you. 
 Croupier :  Les jeux sont faits. Merci. 
 Thank you. No more bets. 
 Drink, Freddie? 
 Yes. Whisky. 
 Jonathan : Can I get a fresh whisky, please, sir? 
 He's got it. 2-4-7-6. 
 All right. Well, I'll go. 
 No. I'm a pregnant woman. Perfect cover. 
 Ange, that's not cover. You are a pregnant woman. 
 (SIGHS) All right. 
 Well, if you're gonna go, take this. 
 Bloody hell! 
 Don't be silly, Joel. I'm English. 
 If there's a problem, I'll call you. 
 Ange, I'm not letting you walk out that door without it. 
 Thank you. 
 You do know how to use that thing, right? 
 Oh... 
 Right. Now. How do I look? 
 "You look great, Angela." OK. 
 Look, if there's a problem, I'll call you. 
 You look great. 
 Oh, give over. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Croupier :  Merci. Rien ne va plus. 
 There you are, Freddie. 
 Ah. 
 How're you getting on? 
 (LIFT BELL DINGS) 
 (WHIRS AND BEEPS) 
 (PANTING) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (TV TURNS ON) 
 (TV TURNS OFF) 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Yeah? 
 Man :  Yeah, hi, I'm in reception. I have an international package for Mr Richard Roper. I need a signature for that. I'm sorry, sir, I can't drop it in the lobby. 
 I need a signature. Thank you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 (EXHALES) 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Jonathan : You should stop, Freddie. 
 Losing streak never ends until you cut it. 
 I'll stop when I want. 
 Ah, I am in this. 
 Losing in Daddy's casino, Freddie. 
 That's got to be a metaphor for something. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Let me get you a glass of champagne? 
 Yes. 
 (CHUCKLES) Everybody happy? 
 I never lose. 
 Up or down, Dickie? 
 Something's not right, Sandy. 
 She's trying too hard. 
 What did Caro say? 
 She hasn't seen anything. 
 He's watching me. 
 I can tell. 
 Just keep calm. 
 Could I have two glasses of champagne, please? 
 Thank you. 
 Freddie : I never lose. OK. No. 
 I never lose. (LAUGHING) 
 Jonathan : Freddie, you should stop. 
 Whoa... 
 Freddie : You're having fun? 
 Jonathan : I think it is time to go home now. 
 I don't want to go home. 
 I think it's time to go home. 
 I think so. I think it's probably best. 
 No. 
 We play over here. 
 Big day tomorrow. 
 Go to bed. 
 OK. It's all right. 
 Jonathan : (CHUCKLES) All right. 
 He's just had a bit too much to drink. 
 Don't you worry, he will be fine. 
 I like you. 
 Come with me. I like her. 
 Come on now. 
 Jonathan : Whoa... This way, this way. 
 Freddie : She can come with me. 
 Freddie : (MUMBLING) I drive. 
 Jonathan : OK. 
 I think Sandy should go instead, no? 
 Watch your step now. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa... 
 All right, I think I'll drive, eh? 
 In you get. 
 There we go. 
 (CAR ENGINE RUNNING) 
 (CAR DOOR OPENING) 
 Easy. Easy, Freddie. 
 Whoa, whoa, Freddie. 
 (FREDDIE CHUCKLING) 
 
 
 
 Jonathan : Now. 
 What do you say we sit down, huh? 
 Sit down. 
 Sit down? Just here? 
 Oh, OK. 
 A-ha. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Where is your family, Freddie? 
 This isn't the family house. This one is for business and pleasure. 
 No maid? 
 (SNIFFLES) No, they come in the day. 
 Jonathan : They come in the day. 
 Good. 
 What do you say to a drink, Freddie? 
 Yes. 
 Whisky? 
 Yes. 
 Splash of water OK? 
 Freddie : Yes. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 There you go. 
 (JONATHAN EXHALES) 
 You know, Freddie, there's, er, something I've been meaning to ask you. 
 Hmm? 
 It's been playing on my mind. 
 You had a girlfriend called Sophie Alekan in the Nefertiti Hotel. 
 Do you remember her? 
 How do you know about her? 
 Do you remember her? 
 Did you kill her? 
 My God. 
 I know you. 
 The night manager. 
 Did you kill her? 
 Why do you care? She was a whore. 
 (GROANS) 
 Did you kill her? 
 Argh. 
 No. 
 I was there, but I didn't do it. I swear. 
 Who did? 
 One of Roper's men. 
 Roper said he couldn't trust her to stay quiet. 
 Was Roper there? 
 Was Roper there? 
 He wanted her to tell us who had helped her. 
 But she wouldn't say. 
 She didn't say a word. 
 Should not have kept her mouth closed. Whore! 
 (GASPING) 
 (EXHALES) 
 Excuse me. 
 Andrew Birch. I believe you have an envelope for me. 
 Yes, sir. From the lady in Room 2104. 
 Thank you. 
 Could you arrange a car for me tonight, please? 
 (SPEAKING ARABIC) 
 Jonathan : Akhmed. 
 Assalam-alaikum. 
 Walaikum-assalam. Let's go. (LIFT BELL DINGS) Go on ahead. Go on. But when I went down to the foyer, there was no parcel. Check the hotel lists. Every guest. Get the names to me. OK. (GUARD SPEAKING ARABIC) Andrew Birch. TradePass Limited. I'd like to check the shipment that's leaving tomorrow, please. (VAN DOOR OPENING) (SPEAKING ARABIC) Shukraan. (PANTING) OK, now, guys. Go, quick. Go, go, go! OK. So you know what to do? This is the number. You must memorise it. And you press connect and it will start the party. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Thank you, Akhmed. Any time. My pleasure. (SPEAKING ARABIC) This is because of Miss Alekan, right? Yes. And no. I'll see you, brother. You take care, brother. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (UNLOCKING DOOR) Night manager : Breakfast, madam. Compliments of Mr Birch. (SOFTLY) Thank you. (SOFTLY) You're welcome. (DOOR CLOSES) (KEYPAD BEEPING) (ERROR BEEPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Roper : Oh, dear. It's hard keeping track of all those codes and PIN numbers, isn't it? Have you tried your birthday? I just found this... Oh, Jemima. You let someone break in here and steal from me. The question is, who? Please don't tell me it was Corky. Because I might not believe you. Morning, Frisky. Would you mind stepping in here for a moment? Yes, this is Andrew Birch. Of course, sir. (MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY) Come on, darling. (WATER SLOSHING) Be a good girl. (JED GAGGING) No point in thinking he's going to stop. Frisky never stops. (JED GASPING FOR BREATH) (JED STRUGGLING) (SOBBING) You know, I never really thought you had it in you. You know what I think? I think you must care very deeply about the person you're protecting. I saw you look at him. In the casino. How close you are. Dromgoole speaking. Did you get what I sent you? You know what I think, Geoffrey? When we open those crates tomorrow I don't think we're going to find farm machinery inside. Do you? (SCOFFS) It doesn't look good for you, Geoffrey. What do you want? Stay away from the Egyptian affairs. If Roper tries to get in contact, cut him off. No safety net. You don't even take his call. What do I get? You get to survive, Geoffrey. (CHUCKLES) Morning, Andrew. My, you look spiffy. Ready to go? When you are, sir. How was the casino? Very successful night. I am a winner. I can't get hold of Freddie. He should be here by now. You put him to bed, didn't you? Left him sleeping like a baby, sir. Never mind. His loss. (PANTING) Officer : Hello, Mr Roper. The trucks are loaded. Everything is waiting for you. Thank you. Dickie. I've just been through the hotel list of the medical delegation. All names check except two. They're in room 2104. All right. Call Frisky, get him to clean it up. Andrew! Let me show you the hospitality area. It's me. He's asked for room service in 2104. Yeah. OK. Understood. Ah, well. It seems that you and I are going for a little walk. When I tell you, you are going to get up, we'll wash your face and maybe get you dressed. But you are gonna be very quiet. Get up! (SHUDDERING) I'll take your phone if you don't mind. Sure. Ah! (GROANING) Search him for weapons, make sure he's not wearing a wire. It's a very rare thing, Jonathan Pine, for me to trust a person. But you were special. I knew it the first moment I saw you. Saved my son. Risked your life. Should have known something was wrong. I don't know what you're talking about. Corky knew it, of course. Tried to make me see. Poor old Corks. You killed him, I suppose. To save your own skin. Yes? He was a good man, Corks. Loyal man. Now he is lying in a ditch on a Turkish mountain because of you. Well, for his sake and for mine, I can promise you that your death is going to be a hundred times worse. Who are you working with? (EXHALES) No one. Well, that's not true. For starters, I know you're working with Jed. That's a mistake, by the way. Not the sort of thing a man does. (BREATHING RAPIDLY) You sick f*ck. (GRUNTING) Roper : Ah, ah, ah... We need that pretty face for the buyers. We can make sure that nothing else happens to her, if you cooperate. Did you kill Freddie? You would have killed me, obviously. (SIGHS) I got you so wrong. (CAR APPROACHING) Now, listen. Jed is in a very bad way. And I'm not feeling particularly sentimental about her welfare. Her life depends on the quality of your performance in the next half-hour. So smile. (FRISKY HUMMING) (RINGING) Joel? Where are you? I'm outside the loading area. (SHUTTER CLICKS) Oh, my God, Ange! Get out of there. Pine's blown. So you're blown. Get out! Can you see him? Is he all right? Ange, listen to me! Pine is blown! Get the hell out of there. (HUMMING) (SHUDDERING) Room service. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Room service. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (JED PANTING) (MOUTHS) (GUNSHOT) (FRISKY SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) Get out! Go on! Go! Argh! You bitch... Go. Get out. Get out. You bloody bitch! (GROANING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Roper : Mr Kouyami. Sorry to keep you. Are you well? How are you? Good, thank you. Today marks the beginning of a new trade route, Mr Roper. And the beginning of a beautiful friendship, to coin a phrase. Mr Birch. Mr Barghati. How are you? Very well, thank you. As you can see, the trucks are loaded with the spec as agreed. The drivers are ready to take them to the destination of your choosing. Er, Jasper. Yes, sir? Get them rolling, will you? Yes, sir. Let's go! Where is Mr Hamid? I'm afraid Freddie was a little bit of a bad boy last night. I think he might be paying the price this morning. (ALL CHUCKUNG) We can make a start without him if you are content. I suggest we process the second half of the payment. I am entirely content. Good. Mr Barghati, after you. Beautiful day for it. The best. Please check. Thank you. Yes, good morning. It's Sandy Langbourne here. TradePass. For authorisation. Mr Birch will now complete the transaction. Won't you, Mr Birch? Don't mess it up, Andrew. Lot of people depending on that beautiful little iris of yours. Come on, Andrew. We haven't got all day. (CHUCKLING) What's going on, Jasper? Why have they stopped? I don't know, sir. Roper : What? Jesus. I want my money back, Mr Roper. Mr Roper. You. Transfer my money right now. Dickie. Where's the first payment? There should be $300 million already in here. Oh, you beauty. Kouyami : Did you hear me, Mr Roper? I want my money. Now! We better leave. We mustn't be seen... I want the full amount returned to me. Do you understand? If you do not pay, there will be consequences. Don't you dare threaten me! Who do you think did this? Arab militia! Little brown rats like the rest of you! You'll get your money when I'm good and ready! Understand? We better leave. Yalla. Gentlemen. Let's go. Let us reconvene in the Nefertiti in one hour. Let's go. Our organisation is used to dealing with problems like this, we can deal with it. Dickie, we need to go. Pine! Jed. You let Jed go, you get the money. You'd buy that girl for $300 million? (EXHALES) Call the airfield. Tell them to have the jet ready in one hour. Boss, maybe the back entrance? Yes. Roper : They come to the room. You transfer the money. I let Jed go. Clear? We've not been introduced. My name's Angela Burr. Dickie Roper. Where's Jed, if you don't mind me asking? She's downstairs, Jonathan. All yours. Dickie. This is pathetic. Who the hell are you? I'm Angela... I know your name. I mean, who are you really, in the grand scheme of things? Oh, in the grand scheme of things? Don't know. I live in Bermondsey. Galt :  This is London... This is Dickie Roper. Get me Halo. There is no Halo at this number, sir. Don't be a tit. Geoffrey Dromgoole gave me this number personally. I'm afraid I'm unable to help you. (SCOFFS) Aw. No joy? Must be a peculiar feeling, is it? All those VIP rooms, five-star hotels. You're now on the wrong side of the velvet rope. Do you feel quite discombobulated? I suppose you've been preparing this for a while. Practising in front of the mirror, have we? Yeah. Since the sports day in Kurdistan. I always thought those kids could do with more protection. So that's what's happening now. Me and Jonathan. We're protecting them. Not the ones you've already killed, obviously, but the next ones. Protecting from what? From me? I never killed anyone. I never stole, never fiddled my taxes. All I did was work for a company. Owned and operated by your little Pinocchio. I might get a 50 quid fine. With a bit of luck, they'll let me pay in instalments. Yeah. You're probably right. Government lawyers, useless, aren't they? I was one once. Right. So... (noon OPENS) Mr Roper. Roper : The same. Not a painting. How can I help you? These gentlemen are here to place you under arrest. Really. For what? Uh, contravention of Egyptian import rules, conspiracy to murder. And do these clowns have names? Because I'm sure Mr Hamid, Sr would love to know what they are. Mr Hamid is a very good chum of mine. Chum? By this time tomorrow, I'm going to be back in my humble croft in Majorca, sipping a 30-year-old Scotch. It's a possibility. I hope not. By the way. Good luck with the baby. It's a wonderful thing, to bring a child into this world. (GRUNTING) Why did you do it, Jonathan? You have to commit. You have to make a decision. Couldn't just scratch my nose, could you? See you in a few days. (MEN CLAMOURING) (SPEAKING ARABIC) What the hell's going on here? I've got no idea. Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a second. He deserves it. No! No! No! No! No! What time do you land? 6:00 a.m. Bright and early. (CHUCKLES) There be someone there to meet you? (SHAKILY) I think they'll all be there. I keep thinking, what if he doesn't recognise me? A son always recognises his mother. And if he doesn't, I'll tell him. (CHUCKLING) Okay? You can come visit soon, though. I promise. Be good. You're a funny fish, Jonathan. (CHUCKLES) I know. Good. (EXHALES) Is there anything I can do for you, sir? (CHUCKLES) No, thank you. Nothing at all.
