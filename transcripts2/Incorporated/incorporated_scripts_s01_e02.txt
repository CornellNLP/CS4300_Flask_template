 [tense music] [computer chiming] Hey, Aaron. It's Ben. I'll call you Ben. As long as you don't forget Aaron. I don't. So you found her. If it is Elena. My sister. Where is she? That's a group of girls being escorted to Arcadia. She's a s*x slave. Can you get in here? Not till I get to the 40th floor. Laura. How is she? So now you're her errand boy? I'm your husband and her son-in-law. Just meet her... if she's gonna be a grandmother, she has a right to know. You did that? [both grunting] Not bad, kid. How'd you like to make some money? We were thinking about going out for drinks after work. So where is the fun gonna be? I think in Southgate. [whimpering] [cries] Did you invite him? Sure. You're working him, right? Ow! Are you okay? Excuse me a second, will you? [device chiming] [alarm blaring] That's not mine. That's not mine! Please! Chad got fired today. [emotional music] You know what the saddest part is? ♪ Knowing that you'll never see a world better than this one. ♪ Things weren't always like this. People had homes. Homes that my company insured. Homeowner's insurance. Can you believe that? System was rigged, though. But we called it an act of God. You know what an act of God is? It's all the big stuff; drought, hurricanes, floods. The entire city of Miami falling into the ocean and we didn't pay out a dime for any of it. We just cranked up the AC in our company car and we just kept on trucking. Dad, it's gonna be okay. Listen to me. I want you to remember something, all right? You're more than just a climate refugee looking for a handout. You're worth more than that. Understand? ♪ Good. ♪ I love you, Aaron. Dad? I'm so sorry. No, Dad! ♪ [crowd screaming] ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ [tense music] ♪ What's up, old man? ♪ Where did you get the gas? Anybody spare some food? Anything? ♪ f*ck off, kid. ♪ Hey, kid! Come here. [coins jingling] ♪ Nice catch, blind kid. Hey! Hey, wait! Hey, stop! ♪ 
♪ Move over. ♪ I just want to talk to ya! Kid! ♪ Kid! ♪ [sighs] Thanks. No problem. I'm Elena. Aaron. Why was that guy chasing you? Come on, I'll show you. Recognized: Camp Internal Compliance. I.D. number K504687. Dispensing rations. Those kapo assholes get extra rations. The rest of us don't get enough. You hungry or what? [dramatic music] ♪ We'll soon start evaluating candidates. We live in troubled, uncertain times, so the vetting process will be extremely thorough and rigorous. We will not let another traitor slip through. ♪ Not again. ♪ Rousing speech. Inspiration or intimidation... sometimes it's a fine line. Anything on Peterson? So far, not much. I do know what he was stealing: security protocols. Is it connected to the attack in Jakarta? Possibly, I don't know yet. It's your job to know. No, it's my job to find out. And that may take time. The Board is breathing down my neck. We need answers now. Then I suggest we amp up the pressure. How? You're already doing enhanced background checks on the candidates. Yes and maybe we can use that as an opportunity to dig into everyone in Counterintelligence Tech. Mr. Peterson may have had an accomplice. Or at least a witness. Fine. Do whatever it takes. I just want to remind you that your son-in-law works in that department. I said whatever it takes. ♪ [devices chimes] ♪ Aaron! [giggling] Stop! ♪ [groaning] [yelling] Ultrasonic waves heat human tissue as they pass through your body. That was 150 decibels. At 160, it will cause permanent damage. No, please. I swear I'll tell you anything you want to know. [cries] [pained groaning] ♪ [techno music] Good! Now push it. Last half mile. ♪ Stop program. Keep it up. [tense music] Let's go, move it. ♪ Let's go, let's go. ♪ Mrs. Larson? Are you okay? Oh, yeah, it's just, uh... must've scratched myself on a branch. I should be more careful. Uh, could you get... Oh, yes, of course. [aerosol spraying] Rachel, can I ask you something? You used to work for the Sharma family, didn't you? Before they got exiled. Yes, ma'am, I did. Why do you ask? It's just, there's, uh... another family that's being let go from the company and, um, I was wondering, do you see the Sharmas anymore? I mean, on the outside. Uh, no, ma'am. Mr. Sharma, he... There was an accident. I should get back to work. ♪ I have to hand it to you. You've hidden your tracks well. ♪ Trust me. I know everything. Every corner you've cut. Every subordinate whose work you took credit for. ♪ You're not an admirable man, Mr. Peterson. [whimpers] But when it comes to company security, there's nothing in your history that suggests anything out of the ordinary. Except that trip you took over the wall. To the Red Zone night before last. That was unusual for you. Which is why I can't quite let it go. [device chimes] ♪ Security check. Step away from the desk, please. Wait outside until we're done. ♪ Follow me. Stand over there, please. ♪ Security check. ♪ What I can't wrap my head around was why. Why that place? With underlings from your department, every one of whom despises you. Why did you go there? C-can't remember... Was it to meet with your contact? Was it someone from Inazagi? I wasn't meeting anyone! It wasn't even my idea to go to the Red Zone. Then whose idea was it? ♪ It was... it was Ben's idea. Ben? Ben Larson? Yes, he talked me into it. It was all Ben's idea. All Ben's idea. ♪ [tense music] ♪ Mr. Hendrick, right? Human resources. You're not usually up on this floor. Well, the sec team needed a stat check on some of the employees. Maybe you noticed, things are in a bit of an uproar. Yeah. Mr. Peterson. I heard he was caught with classified files. Was he? Oh, that's a terrible thing. Although, it would open up a path for some ambitious person to move up to the 40th floor. Lot of perks come with that. Access to the executive club, for one. ♪ [whispering] What did you do? What I had to. I need to move up the ladder to get to her. And then what? There's no way to get her out of there and nowhere to run... they'll hunt you down. I'm working on an exit strategy. But first I need the promotion. ♪ I hope you know what you're doing. Well, I should. You taught me. ♪ There you are. I was wondering where you got to. Eh, just fueling up. ♪ We need to talk. About? Chad. Our little trip to the Red Zone? 'Cause they'll be asking him about it right now. It's not illegal to go slumming. Yeah, unless it's with someone who gets taken in the next day for treason. ♪ What do you mean? Think about it. It's the perfect place to meet somebody from the competition. Those Inazagi guys at the bar... It looks bad. For both of us. Yeah, well, it was your idea to invite him. No. It was Chad's idea, remember? We weren't even going to Southgate until he suggested it. And when Chad says differently? It's our word against his. ♪ I mean, we both want that promotion, right? ♪ I may have underestimated you, Ben Larson. Yeah. Sometimes I even surprise myself. Hmm. ♪ Mr. Larson. Just the man I was looking for. ♪ Magna Cum Laude from MIT West. Brin Scholar. You have an impressive background. Thank you. It is interesting, though. Your hometown destroyed by a flood. Family dead. Even your college lost to the wildfires. It's almost like you're some kind of ghost. I'm hardly the only one. A lot of people's lives have been upended in the last couple of decades. Yes, I suppose they have. You spent the last four years under Mr. Peterson in counterintelligence tech. Yes, sir. His disloyalty was a shock to all of us. I'm sure it was. I'm just trying to piece together Mr. Peterson's movements over the past few days. His assistant said you came to see him yesterday. Uh, yes. Yeah, I did. So... did anything seem out of the ordinary to you? Oh. Well, I don't want to read too much into it, but... he did seem kind of anxious. He was sweating. You know, jittery. His assistant said he was feeling sick. Maybe he was nervous because he was stealing the files. Of, course, he could've been feeling the effects of a night out in the Red Zone with you. ♪ Southgate? Oh, right, uh... well, about that... Yes, about that. It was odd. Chad... Mr. Peterson, I mean... he never wants to come out, but this time, he said he'd love to come. He's the one who suggested going to Southgate. He even suggested the club we went to. You're saying it was his idea to go out there? Yeah. And like I said, it was... well, it was odd. [device chiming] ♪ What is it?  I'm sorry, sir. But Mrs. Krauss wants to see Mr. Larson right away. ♪ Fine. Tell her he's on his way up. We'll pick this up again later. Of course. Whatever you need. ♪ Sir. What is it? I just remembered something... something that might be important. When we got to the club, there were these, uh, Inazagi guys already there. Inazagi? Yeah. They were laughing about what happened in Jakarta. They even sent us over some Indonesian beer. And you didn't think to share this earlier? To be honest, I... I had a few drinks, myself, so things are kind of hazy. ♪ Anyway, I better get upstairs. [suspenseful music] ♪ [device chimes] _ ♪ Hey, Ant, food's here. Mmm, I'm starving. Even that synthetic sh1t is starting to smell good. They say it tastes like steak. [chuckles] Like we've ever tasted real steak. Aw, Jesus, Theo, look at you. Are you really serious about this fighting bullshit? I'm serious about not being dirt poor for the rest of our lives. I know, but there's other ways we can make some money. Stop worrying so much. Okay? We're gonna be fine. Now come on. Let's eat it while it's still hot. [knocking] [sighs] Nice place you got here, kid. Very charming. You mind if we come in? Oh, sh1t, that's cold! He can't fight again tonight! Look at him, he can barely see straight. That's what the cryotherapy's for. It's negative 240 degrees. Reduces the swelling. Oh, is that what it does? Man, get the f*ck off me! I'm sorry, kid, normally I would've given you a little more time to recover, but this is kind of a special situation. You ever heard of Billy Gavros? He's a scout, private league, in the Green Zones. They hold fights at, uh, parties, private events. Really good money. Green Zones? Yeah, you ever been on the other side? Oh, man, the food they put up, and the women... Hell, even the room you're in. The best part about it... is how clean it is. It's immaculate. ♪ They ever have, uh, fights in the executive clubs? Well, yeah, sometimes. [chuckles] They're not gonna let you sample the goods, though. But trust me, man, the bitches on the inside, they're gonna wet their panties when they see a slum dog like you. If you're not ready, you're not ready. I don't know when this guy's coming back, though. ♪ No. I'm in. ♪ Let's do this. ♪ 
 
 [buzzing] Mrs. Peterson, I'm Laura Larson. Uh, Ben's wife. From your husband's... I know who you are. If you're here to get the keys to the house, they took them. I'm sorry? Your husband is going after my husband's job, right? The house comes with it. But you know that. Uh, I don't want your house. I...I saw what happened this morning. I came to see if I could help. Why? You never seen this happen before? No, I have. Someone I knew and I didn't do anything. [chuckles] So now you've grown a conscience. That's sweet. Look, I understand you're upset. But there is a legal process. It's complicated, but you can appeal this... [laughs] You can't possibly be that naive. That appeal is a formality, Laura. It's a joke. Besides, they've frozen our accounts. I couldn't hire a lawyer right now if I wanted to. It's their insurance policy. I didn't know that. Aren't you Elizabeth Krauss's daughter? You mother is who put that policy in place. I am not my mother, Mrs. Peterson. That's a shame. 'Cause that's actually who I need right now. [emotional music] I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. Wait. Please. I'm sorry, I'm just... ♪ Do you really want to help me? If I can. Then there's only one thing that you can do. And you know what that is. Please. Talk to your mother. ♪ So, this promotion. It's gonna be a company-wide search. I won't be the only decision maker. Of course. Look, I'm flattered to be considered, but I want to earn it. Just like anyone else. I'm glad to hear that. Because everything that's going on downstairs right now, I'm afraid that's just the tip of the iceberg. Do you know that expression? It's from when I was a kid. It means it's gonna get tougher from here. I understand. Do you? The level of scrutiny... the higher up the food chain you go, the worse it gets. Everyone has secrets, Ben. Things they'd rather keep to themselves. Hmm? A trip to the Red Zones, for instance. Maybe an illicit substance was consumed. The point is, no one gets to senior management... without the company learning everything. So if you have something to hide, no matter how insignificant, you can always just drop out. ♪ Well, I promise you. You have nothing to worry about. Been looking for you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay! I don't care about the rations, okay? I just want to know how you did it. That's it. [tense music] ♪ They recycled an old machine. So I stole the biometric sensor, took it apart, and switched it around. A reverse retinal scanner. Just like that, huh? [chuckles] Oh, you got real talent, kid. You and me. We could make some money together. Aaron? Just think about it. He just wants you to steal for him. That's a good way to get killed. Got to eat somehow. My dad's trying to find my aunt in the city. If she sponsors us, we can get out of the camp. My dad's going to try and open a restaurant in the Red Zone. Hear it's pretty bad out there, too. Can't be as bad as Texas was. That's where you're from? Yeah. But my mom, she didn't make it here. [emotional music] This was hers. She gave it to me. ♪ Laura. What're you... This is all about Chad, isn't it? No, it's just a standard security thing. Have a seat. Did you need something? Uh, just moral support, I guess. Moral support? I'm here to see my mother. Oh. It's about Chad's family. They're being expelled from Stanford Mills. [sighs] No, I know. I should let it go, it's just I have seen this before and the truth is, it could be anyone, it could be us... No, that will never be us. You don't know that, though. I mean, the only thing that Fiona did was marry the wrong guy. Laura, you know that if anything ever happened to me, I'd protect you. What if you couldn't? I should get up there. No, Laura... Elizabeth doesn't respond to pleading. You know that. I know. I'll make her a deal, instead. I wish I could help. I do. But my hands are tied. But Chad's family has done nothing wrong. We don't know that. We have procedures, we have policies. Of course. Policies. [sighs] Laura... I didn't make the world the way it is. I know this is upsetting. But you have to concentrate on having your own family now. [scoffs] My own... When I see what that woman is facing with her kids... I don't know, Mom, I don't know how anyone brings a child into this world. [dramatic music] ♪ Did you just use my grandchild as a bargaining chip? Not everything is a negotiation. No, but this is. ♪ Laura. There might be one thing I could do. ♪ Inazagi? I...I can't remember. Let me give you a refresher. One of our people saw you go into the bathroom with Ben Larson. Did someone from Inazagi follow you there? Did you meet your contact in the bathroom? Contact? The person you were selling our security protocols to. I swear... I swear I don't remember. I swear, all I did was get drunk. That's all I did. [device chiming] Oh, please. [whispering] I'm sorry, sir, but we found something. Piece of unauthorized tech... I thought you'd want to see it. ♪ Escort Mr. Larson to his office. See that he doesn't leave until I come for him. ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ Did you speak with your mother? Yeah, she, um... she said that she can't do anything to help you. Can't or won't? The thing is, they... she can't do anything for you, but she might be able to help your kids. How? There's a Spiga couple, Tim and Rayna Shelby. They never had kids of their own. [dramatic music] ♪ Would, uh... would I ever see them again? The agreement says that the birth parents have to relinquish their right to visitation, otherwise... [inhales] You don't have to do it. They've lived on the inside their whole lives. Liam... Liam wants to be a doctor, like you. ♪ Hey, Sayeed. After you win the fight tonight, I'll be waiting. Kid, save it for the fight. Rubes don't get here for a couple hours yet. Suit yourself. You hungry? You ever have a real steak before? Knock yourself out. No pun intended. ♪ [chuckles] Easy, kid. You'll get a cramp. ♪ I remember being like you. But this game here? It's a marathon, not a sprint. You'll get your shot one of these days. But today? Today's mine. ♪ Thanks for the steak. ♪ So far, we can't conclusively establish Mr. Peterson's guilt. He had the files on him. Yes, which raises questions. He knew the scanners would detect them. Why take that risk? Either way, I need more time to get to the bottom of it. And I've told you, we don't have time. The stock is in freefall, I need to reassure the markets now. I know we need closure, but for an executive at Mr. Peterson's level, termination of contract requires a confession. Or proof of guilt. Then we revoke his security clearance, execute his nondisclosure agreement. He knows too much. Fair enough. When it's time. But we're missing something here. My team found something. Someone using unauthorized tech. Who? You told me to do whatever it takes. That's what I'm going to do. Fine, but either way, we're closing Mr. Peterson's file today. ♪ Are we clear? ♪ [bell dings] [cheering] [suspenseful music] ♪ [blows landing] [cheering] [blow landing] [cheers and applause] Yeah! Get up, kid. ♪ Have a seat. ♪ You're young. You've never known a world different than this one. There was a time when you called 911. The police showed up in five minutes. Then it became 30 minutes. Then three hours. Eventually, they stopped coming at all. And that's when those of us who were fortunate enough to have options had to choose... between going it alone out there, or being protected in here. Sir? ♪ This company offers many benefits. But the one thing it cannot abide from anyone is secrets. Now, given that, given what we've found, is there anything you'd like to admit to me? A piece of tech that you weren't authorized to have? [cheering] ♪ [blow landing] ♪ [blows landing] [cheering] ♪ I can explain. ♪ By all means. [device beeps] ♪ The whistle. Yes. Look, I... I signed it out to test it. And you knew very well, upon return, you needed to submit a report signed by your superior? That's the thing. Uh, it kept on frying the inhibitor and I couldn't re-calibrate the pitch. So Mr. Peterson, he... he told me just to forget it. He said he'd "figure out another way." ♪ Another way? To do what? I don't know. I thought it was strange, but he's the boss. It is interesting. ♪ Mr. Peterson was feeling sick. It could've been a hangover. Or it could've been nervousness. But it also could've been because someone used this device on him. But why would anyone do that? You tell me, Ben. Perhaps to download files from his terminal. ♪ [cheering] [blow landing] [cheers] ♪ [blow landing] ♪ Hey, Sayeed. [yells] ♪ [blow landing] [yells] ♪ These files... they have a digital timestamp, don't they? Well, it's just that I didn't come to see Mr. Peterson until 11:00 a.m. I'm sure his assistant can verify that. And before then, I was testing the device in the lab. I was logged in between 9:00 and 10:45. So depending on what time those files were downloaded... 10:23, according to the timestamp. Well, you know, like I said, I was in the lab. ♪ Well, there is another possibility, of course. That someone could've found a way to alter the timestamp. To do that, in a way that wouldn't be traceable, even by the best techs in this company... That would be almost impossible. ♪ I guess there's only one thing to do. Ask Mr. Peterson why he had you sign out the whistle. ♪ [cheering] [blow lands] [yells] [blows landing] [cheers] ♪ [yells] ♪ [blows landing] [cheers] [blows landing] ♪ [cheering] ♪ [cheers and applause] ♪ 
♪ What's going on? Turn that off! What're you doing? I got orders to execute his NDA. Scrub his memory. Whose orders? ♪ Gavros left. Green Zone league not gonna happen. So all that time, money, and effort, just pissed right down the drain. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened out there. Oh, I do. You f*cking lost. To him. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. You didn't want me to win? What, you think the scout came to see you? Who the f*ck are you? Well, then why did you come to my place? Because I wanted a good fight! You know I used to fight, too, right... you know that? Back then, we had regulated competitions. Weight classes. You're proud of what you did... you go out there, you put on a good show for the fans. There's honor in it. A little bit of money, too. This one here... second place. The guy who beat me, he went off to fight in the Green Zones. And now he's punched his own ticket and he's got himself a regular, permanent gig out there. [emotional music] Billy f*cking Gavros. [blow landing] [tense music] [blows landing] ♪ Whoo! Guess you're my ticket now, huh? ♪ Hope you're up to it, kid. ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ [cries] [tense music] ♪ 
♪ What the hell happened to you, man? ♪ Who are you? ♪ I don't know. ♪ [sizzling] ♪ Elena! I was afraid I missed you. You got sponsored. The pass just came through. That's great. My aunt found a place for us in the Red Zone. [car horn honks] Elena! I have to go. [dramatic music] Here, take this. I can't. Sell it for food if you have to. You're getting too big to hide in those old planes. ♪ Bye, Aaron. Good luck. I'll find you. Out there? I will. You'll see. ♪ Laura... Shh. [sighs] ♪ 
♪ [both moaning] ♪ 
♪ [both panting] ♪ I had the worst f*cking day ever. It's okay. It's over. I promise. ♪
