 Previously on "Incorporated"... 
 Hello, Aaron. 
 You're a skint from the fugee camp who assumed a Green Zone identity. 
 [both grunting] 
 [choking] 
 I can't let you hurt my family. 
 Where you gonna send him? 
 South. 
 Goran... 
 Who is this? 
 A doctor. 
 You know this is my block, right? 
 No, what're you doing? 
 [screaming] 
 I give you this space. 
 I help you set it up. You want me to open a clinic? 
 Want Gavros to come back? The Green Zone scout? 
 I can't win. 
 Of course you can. 
 What's this? 
 That's insurance. [yells] [screams] Stop it! Shh, sweet boy, let me help. [whimpering] It's a little gift for a good night's work. Your plan is to take birth control behind your wife's back? Forget about Elena. Have some kids. Sell some cookies. [grunts] I'm beginning to think it was an inside job. [groans] With your permission, I'd like to use Everclear on the entire department. Everything I'm doing is for Elena. Only one person benefits from all of this. Elizabeth's son-in-law. They're gonna use Everclear on me. The only way to get past it is to erase Aaron. What do you mean, "We're going to erase Aaron?" When they put me through Everclear, they'll find out about everyone. Roger, Elena, you. I need to map out my brain and lock all those memories away. Away? Away where? Here. This is an imprint of my current neural map. Once I pass Everclear, I need you to connect this to the base of my skull to bring me back. You'll only have a few days to do it or Aaron will be gone for good. If that thing doesn't lobotomize you completely first. I'm just temporarily disconnecting some circuits. Aaron isn't a circuit. It's who you are. But he's not who I need to be right now. This is gonna sting. [device beeping] Strap me in. [soft dramatic music] So now what? Just, uh, flip a switch and say, "Bye, bye, Aaron." Either that or this thing turns me into a vegetable. Relax. It knows exactly which memories to sever. Then my brain will fill the gaps with the cover story I'm using. The lie becomes the truth. At least that's the idea. ♪ Bite guard. So what if after all this, you still fail Everclear? ♪ Then you run. [exhales sharply] ♪ [device thrumming] [grunting and screaming] [electronic chime] You have arrived. [electronic chime] You have arrived. [electronic chime] You have arrived. Thank you. Off. [electronic beep] [high-pitch squealing] [soft music] ♪ [soft dramatic music] ♪ Morning health scan. [electronic chime] Heart rate, 55 beats per minute. Blood pressure, 120 over 80. LDL cholesterol, 170 milligrams. Sperm count, optimal. Yesterday we thought Roger Caplan was a traitor. Now we're saying one of us might have killed him? [speaker chimes] Retrieve the GPS data. ♪ Mr. Gates. To what do I owe the pleasure? I want you to report to me directly on this. There's a chain of command. You mean Elizabeth? She's the weak link in that chain. Do you really wanna be holding on to it when it breaks. If the outcome of this inquiry were to reflect poorly on her, a better position could come your way. You'd oversee security across all of North America. More power, more authority. You'd never have to set foot in the Quiet Room again. I have to get back to work, sir. ♪ [device beeps] [exhales] Jesus. You got a gut feeling about who did this? I have someone in mind. Hey, didn't hear you come home last night. I didn't. I fell asleep in my car. You what? [chuckles softly] You're working too hard. I know you want that promotion, but don't kill yourself for a swimming pool. You're right. I'm sorry, did Ben Larson just concede that his job isn't the be-all end-all of everything? Maybe it's time I put us first instead. Why don't you come home early tonight? I'll be here. Unless you want me to sleep in the car again. [chuckles softly] Um... Ben, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. What? [chuckles softly] What is it? Um... [high-pitch squeal] [groans] sh1t. Migraine? Hydrate, aspirin, and caffeine. Lots of caffeine. Yeah. What did you want to tell me? You know, it... It's just work. I should go. Big day today. Thanks for the coffee. Every time. Bring up retail. How may I assist you this morning, Mr. Larson? I wanna buy something for my wife. What's the occasion? Just because. May I suggest jewelry? I thought you might. How about a ring? A silver band. Lined with amethyst. Is amethyst your wife's favorite stone? I just think it would look nice. Hey, that one. It's perfect. [pop music playing] Pretty. Can I have it? No. Don't touch that. I got an idea. ♪ Don't move. I'm gonna smack that ball into Lake Michigan. [grunts] Ah. [breathing heavily] Morning, gorgeous. What're you doing? Hi. [laughs softly] You're gonna kill her. [both laugh] Get off me. Get off me. Hey, give me the bat. You're still high. Come here. I said "give me the bat." I think it's time for you to sober the hell up. Hell, no. We're just getting started. Now give me the bat. You're hurting me, all right? It's not hurting. This is fun. Let go! [grunts] sh1t! [dramatic music] I'm sorry! [grunts] Are you crazy? [breathing heavily] Give me the goddamn bat! Give me the bat. Come on. [both grunt] Ah, Jesus, Theo. [soft dramatic music] Thanks. f*ck you. [door slams] ♪ [footsteps approaching] Rachel. Why am I here? I wanted to offer you a job. I told you. I don't wanna work for you anymore. Would you work with me? I-I don't know the first thing about nursing. Well, maybe not, but you know more about these patients than I ever will, and there's so much to set up. We don't even have power yet. [pounding on door] [coughing and wheezing] We need help. What's wrong with him? He can't breathe. Come here. In here. [soft dramatic music] This way. Right here. Lay him down. Rachel, can you put the oxygen mask on? Thank you. What the hell is in his chest? His-his heart's off rhythm. ♪ Why does he have this? He had a congenital heart defect. An... an aortic valve stenosis. We... we took his real heart out when he was ten. When's the last time you updated the settings? We haven't. We... we can't. [gasping] Help him. Rachel, plug this into that generator. Can you lift his shirt up, please? ♪ You're gonna need to hold him down. Do we have power? [generator thrumming] We have power. [grunting] That'll keep his blood pumping, but the generator's not gonna run forever. [machine beeping] If we wanna save your son, we need to reset that heart. [high-pitch squeal] Mr. Larson, follow me, please. [dramatic music] ♪ Is there a problem? We're about to find out. Why aren't you taking me to school today? Her lunch is in the fridge. Something big is happening at work and I have to prepare for it. What about my dance class? Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Today's gonna be different. School and then home. I promise we'll talk about it later, okay? I love you. [soft dramatic music] ♪ Why are you doing this? Did I do something wrong? [device beeps] Can someone please talk to me? What is your name? Ben Larson. Louder, please. Ben Larson. ♪ Mr. Larson, where were you raised? What? Seattle. Why are you asking me this? What school did you attend? [high-pitch squeal]  <u>- [grunts]</u> M.I.T. West. ♪ Roger Caplan. What is the question? Is this about him defecting? ♪ Describe your relationship with Mr. Caplan. Mr. Larson. Roger's a friend. He can be a lot to handle, but we've been working together for a long time. Look, I had nothing to do with him defecting, if that's what you... When did you see him last? What's going on? Answer the question. Where did you see him last? I-I don't know. Work, I think. Is that Roger? [door closes] Did... did an Inazagi kill him? Why are you showing me this? Hey, did you hear me? What happened? Roger Caplan was murdered. Oh, God. Who would want to hurt him? [stammers] I don't know. Who would want to hurt Roger Caplan? I don't know. Did you ever hurt him? No. Never. How did he wind up dead in his car? I told you. I don't know. I can't look at these. Please, I wanna get out. Explain why your DNA and fingerprints are all over his car. I've been in his car lots of times. His heart rate's high. What about his brain activity? It's normal. Eye movement? Stress responses? He's just scared, but everything else is normal. He doesn't know a thing. [suspenseful music] ♪ Out. [quietly] Who framed Chad Peterson? Chad? What does he have to do with Roger? Who framed Chad Peterson? I don't know what you're talking about. ♪ [machinery humming] Please continue to hold. Your call is very important to us. [upbeat music playing over phone] Please continue to hold. Come on. Come on. Hello, thank you for calling Hema-Bionics. This is Dr. Larson at... I'll need the serial number of the device, please. 928-H4W. It's a bionic heart. I just need you to reset it. One moment. We don't have a record of purchase of this cardiac regulator. What difference does that make? If there's no record, it means that it was stolen from one of our facilities. It's company policy for us to permanently deactivate all stolen tech. Thank you for reporting this to us. Wait, you can't do that. You bought it black market? It was a family connection. He said it was legit. My patient needs that regulator. I'd be happy to connect you to sales. I need a fix now. We offer same day service at any one of our approved corporate medical facilities. No, they cannot go to a corporate... Please hold. [call beeps] [music resumes] We can't reset your sons heart remotely. [sighs] Look up schematics on cardiac regulator series VC02. [computer beeps] Display. [exhales] I'll have to do it myself. [soft dramatic music] ♪ [grunts]  [high-pitch squealing] Oh, sh1t. You okay? You seem upset. Hi. It's just a headache. That's it? Just a headache? Sorry, Mr... Hendrick. Human resources. We live in the same neighborhood. Right, I bought cookies from your daughter. Yes, Hazel can be very persuasive. Kids, man. That must be fun. My wife and I just got approved to have a baby. Oh, you... you want a family? Mm. What's it like? The truth? Uh... well, you become a supporting character in your own life. [both chuckle] Hey, can I ask you something? I, uh... I need an objective opinion. Sure. I have this friend, Aaron, I love him. We go way back, but I'm not sure if he's good to have around me and my family. What do you mean? Well, it's not that he's a bad guy, he's just, uh, misguided. I'm sorry. I'm not quite following. Wh... if you had to choose between a good friend and doing what's best for your daughter... you're gonna be a father, so what would you do? Well, family always comes first, right? ♪ You know, I couldn't agree more. Thanks for the coffee. [dramatic music] ♪ 
 
 [exhales] [case beeps] [lock clicks] Birth control? [soft dramatic music] ♪ Mr. Caplan? As you requested, sir. Thank you. ♪ Mr. Caplan? Ben Larson. I work with Roger. We were friends. Everyone here's devastated. I'm... I'm so sorry. I know how close you two were. If you were really my son's friend, you'd know that Roger hated me. I'm sure that's not true. Did Elizabeth send you here? Be nice to the old man so he doesn't start supplying the competition? This has nothing to do with Ms. Krauss. ♪ You weren't friends with Roger. There are no friends in this place. For all I know, you're the one that killed him. Mr. Caplan, Spiga's an honorable company. This isn't a job, it's a lifetime commitment... to the corporation and to each other. Nice speech. Does it come with a side of bullshit? I promise you, Mr. Caplan, I will do whatever I can to find out who did this. ♪ [sighs] Forgive me if I don't believe you. Now get the hell out of my face. ♪ How did Ben Larson beat Everclear? Was there any signs of tampering? Remote access? No, sir. We've looked three times. He developed this machine, it only stands to reason he knows it better than us. Sir, I viewed the schematics, the data, the results. I tested it on myself. From what I can tell, Larson had no knowledge of the murder. Keep looking. ♪ What if I'm losing it again? What happened today? I got an up-close look into the mind of a man I was convinced was a murderer, but all the evidence says otherwise. Every explanation comes up in his favor. Maybe he's innocent. Maybe. I've always been good at spotting guilt. Haven't always been good at spotting innocence. Hey, hey. You're not that guy. You're home with me, with your daughter. You're in a good place. But you don't know what goes on in that room. You don't know what goes on in here. Julian, you can't do this job alone. Find someone you can trust. [machinery puttering] We're almost out of power. All right, we need to move. Can you, please, clear the room? I'm gonna try to jump-start it. [flatlines] [high-pitch whirring] Clear. Clear. You're killing him. Have to reset it manually. What's happening? His heart's already stopped. She's just trying to reboot it. There. That's the manual override. Are you sure? Just hold the tablet still. [grunts] sh1t. [flatline continues] [machine beeping rhythmically] [exhales] Sir? I'm wondering who you have handling tech on Roger's murder investigation. That's above your paygrade. This isn't about Roger anymore. I spoke to his father; he thinks it's an inside job. If we lose that supplier, Spiga's current crop yield takes a hit, we can kiss our second-quarter projections good-bye. That's above your paygrade and mine. I meant what I said in there. Roger was my friend. An asshole, but... my friend. I know you need the help. You don't even have a crime scene location. How do you know that? You wouldn't still be here if you did. ♪ My men scoured that trash dump. There's not a trace of Roger Caplan or his assailant. How'd you determine the location? GPS from his car. Well, you can look there all day, I don't think you'll find anything. Whoever did this knew you'd look at the GPS. They must have covered their tracks by spoofing the data. If you wanna know where the crime really took place, you have to find the anomaly in the GPS data. ♪ This code repeats itself twice. ♪ The route here has been artificially extended, so the point where the code repeats is where the hack begins. This is where the GPS was spoofed. Everything that comes after this point is a fake trail. This is your crime scene location. [dramatic music] ♪ [indistinct chatter] Hey! Excuse me. Yeah. [soft dramatic music] ♪ Hey. This is where it happened. ♪ Breathing, circulation, BP, all normal. So I'm good? You're alive. [door opens] Nobody move! Get down now. [guns clicking, footsteps] Where's the doctor in charge. I'm Dr. Larson. You're in possession of illegally acquired tech, a cardiac regulator. Serial number, 928-H4W. It was reactivated against our consent. We're here to shut it down. You have no right to be here. Failure to comply will result in your arrest and prosecution. [suspenseful music] This is a clinic. Step aside. You need to leave now. Put your guns down. Put it down, asshole! Lower your gun now. We haven't met. I'm Goran. ♪ Well, that's okay. I already know Hema-Bionics. I provide security for your men when they come here to buy plasma from my people. It would be a shame if our partnership took a sudden turn. Think like a corporation. What holds more value? A mechanical trinket or the security of your workforce? Thank you. I'm just protecting my investment. No cameras, good luck finding witnesses, and in this smog, we won't get satellite imagery either. [metallic clicking] [soft dramatic music] ♪ Wind speed, direction, smog patterns. It's a weather monitoring system. What's tech like this doing out here? We can't get accurate weather readings in the Green Zone because of the ionized fields. Which means we can't monitor incoming tornadoes or dust storms. Gold star for the suit. Now why the hell are you on my roof? This yours? He's a weather wrangler. Collects data out here to sell to companies inside the wall. 'Cause none of you powderpuffs can handle it out here. Then you're the guy we wanna talk to. There's my girl. How was your day? Thank you. Good-bye. It was long, and I missed dance. Oh, well, I'm sorry, sweetie. I promise I'll make it up to you, okay? Now, who wants a snack? [communicator chimes] Me. ♪ Honey, why don't you, uh... why don't you finish off your... Your city diorama for school. You're acting weird today, Dad. Hazel, please. ♪ Hello, Reed. If you're getting this, it's because you haven't brought me back yet. Look, I get it. Your life is safer without Aaron, but if you wait too long, I don't get to reverse what I did and Elena never gets out. I hate to do this, but a certain hacker I used to run with taught me to always have a fail-safe. So here it is: You have 72 hours to bring me back or your real identity gets released to Spiga. Your cover will be blown. You know what you have to do, so do it. [communicator beeps] [rock music] ♪ [indistinct chatter] Whoo! Where the f*ck have you been? You're on tonight. I don't need a warmup. How much you drink today? I want to fight. That's who you're fighting. Cool. Terrence, you wanna get that fight, the kid should sit this one out. Kid, Gavros is coming tonight. I told him all about my thoroughbred, and he says he can get us a fight beyond the wall, if he likes how fast he runs. So... why am I looking at a mule. I want to fight. [soft dramatic music] The steaks better be good tonight. [suspenseful music] Rage me. Now? Yeah, now. [exhales, breathes shakily] Again. ♪ Do you remember seeing anything that day? Or do you know anyone who might? I don't socialize much. Tell your man to keep his finely manicured fingers off of my tech. Well, you monitor wind speed and direction, what about the sound the wind makes? Data equals cash, kid. How about heat signatures? [quietly] Yeah. [tense music] His readings could triangulate when wind and sound make contact with an object. How does that help us? If we can pinpoint the precise point of impact every time wind hits that object, I think I can build a 3D outline of what the crime scene looked like. You can get me a face? If his data's reliable, I'll be able to show you who killed Roger before you're done with dinner. You just signed your new client. Give him what he wants. [computer beeping] [footsteps approaching] Dad, what're you doing? I was thinking we might go camping. Like in the backyard? Uh, no, a little further than that. I thought we could head up north. Thought we could sleep under the stars just for a while. Doesn't that sound fun? We'd go outside the wall? Well, yes. Would we have to go through the Red Zone to get there? Since when have you been worried about the Red Zone? My Spiga Scout leader says bad people live there, and they hate us. That's why we have the wall. Hazel, your scout leader is a dummy. Now, come on. We'd be together the whole time. We'd share an adventure. You and me. I don't wanna go there, Dad. [exhales] My friends are here, school's here, the scout's are here. Hazel... It's scary. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. It was just a thought. [exhales] It was... it was... like make-believe. I'll never make you do that, sweetie. Take wind data and render it into 3D. [computer beeping] Add sound data and triangulate where each sound hits an object. Close-up on the lower frame in front of me. Am I interrupting? Or are you busy making private time with our home network? That minx. Power down. Mr. Larson, setting aside work for your wife? This is a first. I told you this morning. I wanna put us first. [soft music] [giggles] [breathing heavily] ♪ [soft dramatic music] I see you upgraded your gear. Well, you never know what kind of scumbag I might catch sneaking around my office. I'm not worried. You can't aim worth a sh1t. [both laugh] The last time I saw you was when? The general's funeral. Right after the D.O.D. closed up shop and sent us home with a $600 check and our dicks in our hands. You've come a long way. Ah. [chuckles] You remember the last thing you told me? When my uncle said he'd hook us up? That I was done hurting people. And you wanted a cozy corporate job. How's that working out for you? I'm not here to reminisce. Then why are you here, exactly? I need some information about a hit on a suit. A hit? Outside the wall. The man from Spiga's here to see me about a murder. I'm here to see if you'll help out a fellow soldier. Well, now you're just trying to take advantage of my soft heart. You really want my help? Then take my offer. It's still on the table. I'm happy with my job. I fund a clinic. I'm a man of the people. What do you do after you punch in? Brother, I just need information. Of course, Cap. I'll ask around. If I hear anything you'll know. Was that so hard? Now, why don't you tell me why you're really here. ♪ My wife says I'm supposed to trust someone. What's it say about me that you're the one I trust? ♪ [both breathing heavily] You seem different. Yeah, how so? You're just present. [chuckles] I didn't realize I was being so absent. What did you wanna tell me this morning? Something was on your mind? I wanna quit my job. What? [exhales] I started a clinic outside the wall. Laura... I just can't take it anymore. The tongue extensions, the belly button removals. I have a medical degree and I've never practiced real medicine until now. [exhales] You're worried. Yeah. I get it. It's reckless and it's dangerous. I know, but, Ben, I saved somebody's life today. I got to be a real doctor. We're trying to start a family. I know. You want me to stop? No. If this is what you need to do. You're facing down your biggest fear and telling it to go to hell. I think it's brave. I'll take precaution. Yeah, you'll need a tracker and maybe a bodyguard. Oh, my God, easy there. The mother of my children has gotta be safe. [grunts] I almost forgot. What? [soft music] Oh, my God. Ben, this is beautiful. ♪ You know you are so getting laid again. That was the hope. [giggles] [cheers and applause] [grunts] [grunting] [breathing heavily] [cheers and applause, blows landing] Come on, get up! Come on! Knock him out! Knock him out! Ah, come on, man! [coughs] Go to sleep, asshole. [choking] [dramatic music] ♪ Gavros. ♪ 
♪ He's dead. He's f*cking dead, you son of a bitch. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a code black. [crowd roars] [crowd chanting] Theo! Theo! Theo! ♪ [chanting continues] How did Ben do? He passed. Well, that's a relief for both of us, I'm sure. Keep me posted on progress. There is something. [soft dramatic music] David Gates is gunning for you. ♪ Time to extract Dr. Sanjay Maraj. Let's initiate Operation Persephone. If we secure his work, I can ask the board for anything. Including the head of David Gates. [keyboard keys clacking] We really need to stop meeting like this, Reed. I knew you'd try to retrieve the files I have on you, I'd do the same, but it's not gonna work, and by trying to hack me, all you've done is speed up the clock. Whatever time you had, my program just cut it in half. Bring me back. Or you know what happens. ♪ f*ck you. [keyboard keys clacking] [clatter] Resume. [power thrums] ♪ Continue sound rendering. [computer beeping] Add smog patterns. ♪ Isolate all wind data, isolate sound data, and map out all points of impact. ♪ Triangulate along the X-axis for depth. [suspenseful music] [phone chimes] Status update. Almost there. Triangulate along the Y-axis and Z-axis. Length and width. ♪ What do you see? ♪ Larson, what do you see?
