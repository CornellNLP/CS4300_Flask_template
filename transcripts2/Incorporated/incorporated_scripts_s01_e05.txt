 Take this. Bye, Aaron. 
 I'll find you. Aaron! Oh! Told you I'd find you. I just have so much riding on this scholarship. But what about you? You may not realize your dream of attending college. There could be a place for you in the Spiga family. Get away from my daughter. Okay. The guy who runs things around here is named Tino, and I work for him. Your guy shoots, you don't make it to the wall alive. What is this? $20,000. Where did you get this? [glass shatters] [fire whooshes] My sister, she's a s*x slave. Where is she? Arcadia. Can you get in here? Access is restricted to senior execs. I need a personnel file. This feels a little out of your purview, doesn't it? Hendrick, right? Roger Caplan came to my office. I just need a little more time. This guy is onto you. I need you to get me into Arcadia. Who is it you're gunning for? There's someone standing in my way. I have to go. Go? Wait... Presentation's at 1:00. I think he's connected to one of the companions. [dramatic music] _ [indistinct chatter] [sighs] Hey, buck up, kid. I'm leaving you the shadow. There's a contact on the ghost drive... A guy named Tino, who will set you up for work when you get out. I got you something too. It's a water key. Took me three days to get through the metal yard for parts. It'll get you into any FEMA water truck. Well, if things don't work out, I might need it. There won't be any water trucks where I'm going... No rationing either, but this is good. This is really good. Thank you. Must be some back door you found. Yeah. Unfortunately, it's about to close, so, uh... I gotta go now. Hey, uh... you're already better at this than I ever was. Keep your head in the game. You'll be fine. 'Kay? All visible religious iconography, clothing, or headgear is strictly prohibited in public spaces. Do me a favor? Check on Elena for me. Do yourself a favor. When you get out of here, don't look back. [light whooshes] _ [sirens blaring] Hurry, please! [siren quavers] [indistinct chatter] What the hell are you waiting for? Restaurant didn't pay their bills. We're here to make sure that the fire doesn't spread to the places that did. Are you f*cking kidding me? Hey! [grunts] Try that again, you get the other side of the axe. No, no... [distressed breathing] No! [indistinct chatter] You son of a bitch. You did this. [wallops] No-no-no-no-no! Aaron didn't do anything. He scammed the money exchange in broad daylight. You think I didn't hear about that? The whole neighborhood knows. We got caught in the crossfire, because you shorted Tino and his cut, didn't you? Didn't you? You think Tino did this? Everything we built... It's gone. It's all gone. [fire whooshes] _ [poignant strings] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] [elevator dings] As a reminder to our guests, air pollution levels are elevated today. Please use caution when exiting the hotel. [dynamic music] Target is on 24th floor. [device trills] [device chirping] 23. 23rd floor. George Caplan? I'm Anastasia. ♪ ♪ Thank you for meeting me here. I'm intrigued. You must be quite a powerful man to merit this. That's why I need you to keep it between us. Can you do that? Of course. That's what we do. As long as this stays in place, I'm yours completely. The three of us then? [sighs] Just... just me. Uh, please have a seat. Last words of advice. Do what you have to do to get what you need. She's just a piece of company property. [door closes] Anastasia was it? It's really nice to meet you. Likewise. It's real. Go ahead. Music. [computer chirps] [soft jazz plays] [laughs] Ah... [clears throat] So let me explain. That... that man is my father, and I have a... a problem. It's not physical. Dad thought that this might help. I understand. Just relax, and let me do everything. ♪ ♪ [exhales] [thumps] [toilet flushes] Ugh. Oh, jeez, sorry. I didn't think you'd get here so fast. Uh, can I have a few minutes? Oh, of course. Thank you. [chuckles] Uh... um, can you tell me about yourself first? It's a... it's a trust thing. What do you wanna know? Uh, where are you from? What are your passions? Let's see... My parents were diplomats, so I grew up all over the world. Attended a girls' school in Switzerland. The campus was way out in the country... No boys around for miles. Sometimes, when we got lonely, my roommate, Silvie, and I used to... Okay, look, I know this is a little weird, but if this is gonna work, I need the real you. Not that softcore bullshit they make you memorize. Please? If it helps, I guarantee that I will not keep you very long. [chuckles] Come on. Where... Where are you really from? [laughs] Mr. Caplan, you know I can't tell you that. Oh... Okay. Mr. Caplan. Message received. It must be exhausting. Losers like me blather on all day about our problems. Well... I can tell you my parents weren't diplomats. Oh, yeah? What did your dad really do? Nothing interesting. My dad negotiates grain contracts. It has to be more interesting than that. [laughs] [dynamic music] [device chirps] ♪ ♪ [device suctions] My father... He had a little restaurant in Franklin Heights. Had? It's gone now. I'm sorry. I just made you sad, didn't I? [soft jazz plays] I'm not sad. I'm very happy to be here with you. Separate building systems. Ben was right about you. Ben... Ben Larson. He's a... he's a friend from work. He said you were special. Ben Larson? Never heard of him. It's okay. We're alone. How did you two meet? What does this about? It's about Ben Larson. I told you. I don't know him. Well, I think you do. And you're gonna tell me the truth right now. The truth? [device blares alarm] Sure. The truth is that with your pants off, all you limp dicks look the same to me. No... Now I am going to ask you again, and if you don't answer... then I start carving. Maybe they fix ya, maybe they just let ya scar up. Do you know where Spiga sends girls like that? To the silos to service the grain crews. You can cut me. I've been cut many times before. A client used to hold my head under water... Said it helped him cope with the stress from the office. There is nothing you can dream up in your sick, twisted imagination that I have not endured in this job. Come on. So go ahead. Make me scream. But you'll get the same answer. I don't know Ben Larson. How deep do you want me to go? However deep you want. [groaning] [alarm pulses] [whimpering] [gas hisses] [inhales aggressively] [alarm droning] What the hell? There has been an atmospheric contamination. Please use the oxygen rebreather units provided in your room. Then exit the building in an orderly fashion. There has been an atmospheric contamination. Please use the oxygen rebreather units provided in your room. Then exit the building... [elevator dings] [indistinct chatter] Evacuation is in progress. Please stay calm.

The presentation. Right. I... Sorry, I'm... I had to take care of something. I'm on my way.

[both grunting] [whooshes] Come on, let's go again. Laura... No, I know. I get it. I dropped my guard. I tensed up. Let's just go again. The point of Past Trauma Re-experiential Therapy is not to pound your trauma into submission. It's to explore every facet of what's causing your emotional pain. Fine. Let's explore it. Go again. We need to talk about your feelings. Oh, my God. That's how this works? You want it to work, don't ya? Look, I have tried cognitive enhancement diversion, wearables, drugs, even a goddamn VR pet, and now this crap. It's all bullshit. Everyone things that they know what I went through, but they don't. I have to go. [elevator trills] [indistinct chatter] Where the hell were you? I got held up. The Deck isn't even finished yet. It's fine. I got this. [sighs] Mr. Larson, you're late. I know. I told you... I'm sorry. [device chirping] Ben... Uh, go. [device pings] Counterintelligence used to... [clears throat] Sorry. Counterintelligence used to be about breaking into security systems and databases, but now, thanks to Everclear, it's about breaking into the human mind. We no longer rely on outdated interrogation techniques. We can now literally turn people's brainwaves into usable images and actionable intelligence. [sighs] [door squeaks open] Boris... what the hell is wrong with you? Lack of good role models probably. Are you sure this is the place? Girl's a high-end spreader from Franklin Heights. This is where they got her. Of course, if you want some A-plus brainiac yum-yum... You're disgusting and I hate that I know you. Nice doing business. We're reopening a background check into one of your students. She was recruited into Arcadia a few years ago? Oh... Elena Marquez. That takes me back. We didn't have an empty seat in those days. You have one or two kids stroke out, and you're a pariah. Mm. Is Elena in trouble? No... no, nothing like that. A high-level Spiga executive is interested in acquiring her contract, but we're having trouble reaching her next of kin to update the payout agreements. Those sealed Arcadia personnel files are a real pain in the ass. [computer shuffles] Technically, my files should be locked just as tight. [snickers] [devices chirping] There's only one contact for her. How do you want it? Quietly. By isolating the neurons in sectors one-four-seven, in one-four-nine, and one-six-two, my team has had remarkable success in extracting actionable data. And best of all, we can remove the data with precision at the end of the employee's contract without causing permanent damage as we have in the past. Why erase everything when we can erase only our proprietary information? [device trills] We hope to have Everclear online within the next three months. Unless you have any questions, that's all I have. Uh, let me ask just one question. We're a bio-tech company, correct? Yes. And our firm focuses on the development of genetic strains, new agricultural products, and the production of food for the entire goddamn world? Yes. Then if you could explain to me what the hell we need a mind-reading device for. It's okay. I'll handle this. Expenditures for prevention of intellectual theft account or a full 40% of our security budget. Everclear allows us to apply those funds elsewhere. And what about the millions you've already spent? It will shore up the security gaps I've already flagged for you. Ah... the gaps that almost allowed Chad Peterson to steal our protocols. To the next of kin of Elena Marquez, we regret to inform you that your daughter's contract has been terminated prematurely. If you would like to receive the full death benefit payout, please meet our representative at the address on record tonight at... 5:30 p.m. Letterhead and send. David, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but if you are questioning my performance... What I am questioning are the time and resources you're continuing to spend on a white rhino chase. Everclear is not a white rhino, sir. It's going to be operational within the month actually. Oh, really? Then why does your presentation not reflect that? Because Ms. Krauss taught me to never over-promise. But it will be up and running by month's end. Thank you, Mr. Larson. We'll reconvene and hear the next candidate's presentation in one hour. [eerie music] Ben... I'm sorry. I overstepped my bounds. I appreciate your loyalty. Of course. Just be careful. You made some big claims in there. We all need to make sure we deliver. Yes, ma'am. ♪ ♪ 
 
 [door buzzes] [indistinct chatter] Please be advised. No communication devices are allowed inside the facility. Visiting time is limited to one hour. [conversing in Spanish] [coughing] [retching] [poignant music] ♪ ♪ I've done the math. With what they're charging for room and board, plus the interest, plus what we owe the bank, even with you and I working 80 hours a week each... We'll still be in debt for the next 138 years. When you're gone, they'll come for me, and then when I die, they'll take Theo. This is the first time I ever wished you weren't so smart. I should go. ♪ ♪ I promised Theo I'd make him dinner. You're a good girl, Elena. ♪ ♪ [sobbing] [door buzzes] [indistinct chatter] [car honking] You're Elena Marquez's next of kin? What happened to her? Sir, you know the contract she signed restricts any dissemination of details related to her employment. Are you gonna stand there and tell me nothing about my daughter? Sir, this is just procedure. Provide me with some information, and then we can discuss the employee's demise. How'd she... Did she suffer? No. Nothing like that. But I will need the information. Can you identify this man? [device pings] That's the piece of sh1t that ruined her life. You wanna help me ruin his? With the grain this time. Yes, Tino. If I wanna look like I was in a street fight, I'll get in a goddamn street fight. [upbeat music plays on speakers] Why did you do it? Aaron? [laughs] You got some balls, kid. You ruined her life for a $20,000 haul. What the hell are you talking about? The currency exchange thing? I heard all about that. I just figured you were gonna make it up to me. This little stunt I'm less happy about. You're telling me you didn't burn down our family's place. Why would I do that? I love the tacos. Besides, she just made a deal to settle up everything she owes me. She what? Yeah. Hey, where do you think she's gonna get that money from, huh? I mean... she could sell all her organs. f*ck! I'm gonna forgive this one time, because I can remember what it was like to be under the spell of some Grade A pussy. [groans] [device chirping] Dammit, Roger. Take me to the tracker point. Routing to El Gordo Gustavo. Location is currently out of business. [device chirping] [knock at door] [exhales] Thanks for coming. So I hear you caused a riot. [scoffs] I wouldn't say that... Though, maybe a small one. You doing okay? [sighs] Honestly, I've been better. Is it Ben? No... he's great. I mean, you know how work is, but... No, he's fine. It's just, um... I've been having the episodes again. Are you seeing your therapist? I just quit another one today. Look, I need to say something, and it's something that... [laughs] God, I feel ridiculous. Laura, whatever it is... Since... what happened, I, uh... I haven't been on the other side of the wall. Not once. In eight years? It's okay. Trust me, there's nothing out there. That doesn't make me feel like any less of a prisoner. It's fine, Laura. You are fine. You've seen a lot of things... In the war, your job... Sure. But you don't need therapy. Well, doing it and needing it are two different things. So you just deal with it. How? I don't... Not really. There was this guy under my command during the Oil Wars. Smart, fast. Understood strategy like nobody I've ever seen. I'm not a proud man. I know when someone's smarter than me, and this kid was, so I leaned on him more and more. The brass were planning a raid on a refinery outside of Cape Town. I was against it, so I asked this brilliant kid... My guy... He told me we could do it. He knew just where they'd be. So I caved. I trusted his judgment more than my own. We marched in... and then they hit us hard. I lost 2,000 men in three minutes. Jesus. Now as I lay there, bleeding out, I saw him... my guy... With the insurgents. He was sent to gain our trust and destroy us from within. And I let him do it. Hell, I helped him do it. It wasn't your fault. Neither was what happened to you. Doesn't feel like it. It never will. You have to make a decision. Are you gonna let one twist of fate decide who you are? Dad, I found something... Something... God, it'll end her. It'll end Elizabeth Krauss. I just need one last piece, and then... Then when we go to the board and tell them what I found. Call me as soon as you can.

Payout's 30% more for a virgin. Mr. Brownston! Negative for STis and parasites, and she's had all of her inoculations. Standard 20-year contract... The usual disclaimers. I can offer you this signing bonus today, and this payout at the conclusion of your contract. And my father will be released right away? We can have him out in an hour. All the money goes to him and my brother. Less your debt to the bank, yes. All you have to do is sign. Elena! Wait! Ah! Ah! Elena! Girls like us are the lucky ones, Elena. We have something to trade.

That you're a skint from a 'fugee camp who assumed a Green Zone identity? That you've lied to every person you've ever met? What part of what I just said is not true? I always knew the family man thing was bullshit, but growing up here... With all the dose-ers and the chicken necks? It's amazing you can eat with a knife and fork. I can give you what you want. Yeah? Yeah, I tell Elizabeth I'm out, and then I convince her to give you the promotion. You expect me to believe you've got the juice for that? She's my mother-in-law. Lauren and I are giving her her first grandchild. You look your wife in the face every goddamn day and lie to her, and I'm supposed to trust you? You know everything, Roger.

Where are you gonna send him? South. There'll be no cops once it reaches the dust-storm states. The car will get stripped, the body will get dumped. If the sun's shining, it should have enough power to make it to the Mexican wall. I cranked the heat up. He'll be unrecognizable by the time they find him. I saw her, Theo. What? Elena. You... you saw her? I was 20 feet away from her... at a hotel. I... Why the hell didn't you get her? I couldn't. Why not? You think I could just take her? If I get past her guards, then what? They'd hunt us down, Theo. There's nowhere for us to run... Nowhere to hide. We have to think long-term. And now, with the body, the watch... It's all going to help us. I have a plan, Theo.
