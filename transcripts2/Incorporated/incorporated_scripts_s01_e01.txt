 Suspected terrorist attack. 
 Local authorities blame the Sons of Tomorrow, but the radical Micronesian nationalist group has not yet claimed responsibility. 
 The device detonated in an R & D lab of the biochemical giant Spiga, causing at least a dozen fatalities and an immediate drop in the company's stock. 
 It had to happen, today of all days.

 I know, it's like calling yourself a New Yorker.

 Word is it was Inazagi agents. 
 Inazagi? You think they'd dare to?

 Um, no. No, we expect to lose ten points during R.E.M.

 And that warrants having their fields torched? 
 You could convince them to pay the royalties. 
 Our designs are giving these farmers the biggest harvest of their lives.

 Poverty and suffering... do you think you can create great art without them? 
 Oh, they're powerful motivators. 
 I guess they are. 
 Maybe if he'd sold a painting, he would have been a lesser artist and a happier man. 
 I wonder if he would have made that bargain. 
 So the Smithsonian caved? 
 Yep, just last week. 
 They fought and fought, ended up getting half of what we offered them last year.
