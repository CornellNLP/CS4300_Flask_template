 Previously on "Incorporated"... 
 I haven't been on the other side of the wall... 
 In eight years. 
 I've been having the episodes again. 
 You have to make a decision. 
 Are you gonna let one twist of fate decide who you are? 
 My neighbor Rosa... her daughter... there's something wrong with her belly. 
 I've been hearing her scream through the night. 
 Is the pain on her right side? 
 It could be appendicitis. 
 Your friend's daughter... bring her tonight. I'll examine her. 
 These people aren't authorized to be in the perimeter. 
 They're on the log. 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 You haven't told him about the riot you started? 
 What if she's pregnant? 
 Your plan is to take birth control behind your wife's back? 
 I don't want to hurt her. You know I miss your father as much as you do. We're not both equally responsible for his absence, are we? Hello, Aaron. Your skint from the 'fugee camp who assumed a Green Zone identity. I can give you what you want. Get me into Arcadia. I can't let her die in that place. [both grunting] You're gonna destroy everything. I can't let you hurt my family! What happened? He knew who I was. Everything I'm doing is for Elena. I have a plan, Theo. The body, the watch... it's all going to help us. You have to trust me. Are you ready, Mr. Larson? [eerie music] We're waiting. [clears throat] Of course. Uh... ♪ ♪ What's your success rate in extracting actionable information? The results are, uh... p-promising. We've achieved success across all data sets, but, uh... Ben?

Do you accept? Do you accept? Hell yes. Whoo! Ow ow! [giggling] Ugh, can you please put on some lipstick? I'm not sharing your lipstick. Yes. You probably caught something already. I probably did. Ew! Incoming call. Hold on a second. I can't believe you just said that... Hey, Mom. Our reservations are for 1:00 tomorrow at the club. Reservations? I swear I had orange. Who wants orange eyes? Guys. The Rezas are in town. We're meeting them for lunch, remember? Right. Yeah, it'll be good to see them. So what you doing this evening? Not much, just, um... we're gonna grab dinner.

Which is better, gold or purple? Purple. Purple. You don't like gold? It's okay. No. Are you actually updating your emergency contact? My dad is in Brazil this month. My God! You are so paranoid. Never hurts to be prepared. That mean you brought Spermishield? All : Ooohhh. No. You did. No! Amani! She definitely brought it. [Ladytron's "Seventeen"] ♪ ♪ ♪ They only want you when you're 17 ♪ Hey. Watch it. ♪ ♪ What is wrong with you? Trust me, this freak loves it. Give me a poke, sweetheart. [thwack] Ugh!

What is the point of coming all this way if we don't even talk to anyone who actually lives here? Tell that to Marisa. Nice. God, she's so concerned that we're gonna ruin her cover, and she's over there chatting up some Spiga D-bags. I guess she's all talk. ♪ ♪ ♪ So come on ♪

So now I just need one more thing from you... Your name. ♪ ♪ Amani. ♪ ♪ Amani Merced. ♪ ♪ Okay, Amani. ♪ ♪ There's one small problem, Deputy Morse. No one in the history of Spiga has ever requested a transfer from Milwaukee to Sioux Falls. It's about quality of life. It's jumping off the corporate ladder. Makes me think you're cracking up. And that... that'd be a big problem. My wife would prefer a smaller town. You just had a kid, right? Mine are almost grown. I remember when they were just little bundles of meat, screaming till I thought I'd go crazy. That's what kids do. You ever worry you just might snap? No. I heard that about you Oil War vets. You're brutal and efficient. But then you start to see threats where there aren't any. Is that what happened with Captain Berman? You got overzealous maintaining security in your unit, and you just snapped? I was cleared to return to my full duties. And no one has ever questioned my loyalty. Mm. [chuckles] Certainly not Elizabeth Krauss. You're one of the best interrogators I've ever seen. But there's no Quiet Room in Sioux Falls, is there? It'd be a waste of your talents, don't you think? I have other talents. Ah, what we do in this room, Julian... it's bloody, thankless. But we do it for the good of the company. All due respect, sir... I think I've done enough. [door hisses open] Chief Connor, there's a 12-01. You're both needed, now. This was your daughter ten minutes ago. Is she okay?  For now. For $50,000 blackcoin, she stays that way. We're lucky he asked for a ransom... pay it. We'll initiate containment-recovery protocol immediately. Whoa, wait. I'm sending an account number. We'll put a tracker on the transfer. When he opens the receipt, we'll have a location. This isn't a corporate abduction. A CNR isn't necessary. You have 20 minutes. This looks like a low-level grab-and-bag, sir. Can't take the risk. CNR is in effect now. Assemble the tactical team... immediately. We don't get the money, bad things start happening to Amani. Got it? Just authorize the transfer. Are you listening? Elizabeth. Hey. You can send the money, or we can escalate this thing. No. I'm not paying. She said no. What? She said no. Her mom said no? Goddamn suits... care more about money than their own kids. Get the kit. When a senior executive or their immediate family is abducted, the protocol's clear. You heard Julian. This is not a corporate kidnapping. You don't get to change the rules just because it's your daughter. He called her Amani. She lied to protect her identity. He did, sir. I don't care what he said. If you'd authorized payment, the TAC team would be en route. And Laura would end up dead. You don't know that. The priority for a CNR is to protect corporate intellectual property, not save the lives of kidnapping victims. We'll do our best to make sure she comes home safe. No. I will. I'm overriding you. You have a problem with that, take it up with the f*cking board. The board will side with Connor. Get me assigned to the team. I'll do everything in my power to keep her safe. That's not enough. Laura's watch was deactivated outside the Red Zone club. You have to find her before Spiga does. You're asking me to openly defy chain of command? When you helped me in the past, I made sure that you were rewarded. Connor doesn't want to grant your transfer. I can force his hand. Julian, I don't even want to imagine what they're doing to Laura right now. But it'll be worse if you don't get there before Connor. [suspenseful music] Stall him as long as you can. If the kidnappers don't realize who she is, we have a chance. What are you doing? What is that for? Just remember this is your mom's fault. No, no. My mom wouldn't do... Look, we have the money. There's been a mistake. Don't forget the camera. No, please, just... just let me talk to her. Just let me talk to her, please! Don't hurt me! No, please! Shh. [muffled screaming] [dark music] ♪ ♪ You hold her. What? No, I'll do it. I got it. You sure? Yes, Kim, I'm sure. [moaning] No! ♪ ♪ [whimpering] Shh, shh. ♪ ♪ [shrieking] What the f*ck? Jesus. This is why I usually do it. You have to keep it on the ear. I am. The hard part. [shrieking] [lights buzzing] You got to be kidding me. [sobbing, screaming] ♪ ♪ Oh, God. I need to stop the bleeding. ♪ ♪ Everything okay in there? Yeah. [moaning] Jesus. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I've got to transfer the video, and I'll call Jimmy. ♪ ♪ [wheezing] [exhales] Ma, go. ♪ ♪ sh1t. Shh... it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. [pulsing techno music] [indistinct police radio chatter] ♪ ♪ Guess the last beer's mine. ♪ ♪ 
 
 A girl was kidnapped from the Pocket Rocket about an hour ago. I don't know anything. We both know how this works. They nab somebody on your turf, you get a cut. Try a different answer. Locust Street. Big building on the corner of Edgecombe. Apartment number? There's, like, four different crews in there. I only know the building. ♪ ♪ Oh! ♪ ♪ There's some blood on the bear. I didn't want your son to see it. My son? I'm not any older than you. Do you have kids yet? Sorry, I just assumed. He's my nephew. His dad died working on a pipeline up north. Then my sister was killed by some... joyriding suit in a hit-and-run. Flatass didn't even stop. I'm sorry. My brother... doesn't know to stay on the cartilage. [sighs] My other ear gets cut off, it better be by you. You should think about nursing school. You'd be good. Really? Which corporate nursing school would you suggest I go to? No, I didn't mean it like that. This is probably six months' rent. This is how we get by. [door creaks open] Food's ready. Grab my paper for me. What is it? Jesus. [foreboding music] We hit the goddamn jackpot. Bradley, don't send that video yet. ♪ ♪ She wasn't kidnapped by Inazagi. They realize who she is, that's who they'll sell her to. She has no corporate I.P. But you do. And they could use her to get to you. [digital blip] Your daughter's ransom is now 5 million blackcoin, Mrs. Krauss. [muffled screaming] Could you turn that off, please? You have 20 minutes. If you don't pay, Inazagi will. [dark music] I'm sorry, Elizabeth. We'll do our best. ♪ ♪ Payment complete. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Hello. They know who Laura is. Has Connor deployed the team? Gates authorized the payments. They have her location. But I don't know where she is. I'm closing in on her now. [indistinct voices] [grunting] No! [muffled speech] You're never gonna believe it. The girl we nabbed... her mom is the CEO of Spiga. Don't want you to get dehydrated. Don't worry. Spiga paid. We got 5 million for it... Looks like you're going home soon. You did what? sh1t. We caught a break and we took it. [indistinct speech] You think this is a good thing? You're an idiot. Come on, Jimmy. You can't just grab someone that high up. [overlapping indistinct voices] This is huge. We took a risk, and it paid off. Reverse course. It's 5 million blackcoin, Jimmy. We can retire on this bitch. There you are. You think you're gonna retire? You're gonna get incinerated down at the Firemouth and end up in cut-rate cement. [indistinct voices] Understand the problem... Get the girl back, and we're all we're all rich. Spiga's coming, and they're gonna kill all of us! But we've got the girl. They don't give a sh1t if the girl dies too. It's a goddamn corporate policy! [tense music] It doesn't make any sense. Why would they pay... The money is here, Jimmy. If they were gonna kill us, they wouldn't have paid. ♪ ♪ All the corporations have bounty hunters out there... ♪ ♪ Spiga thinks she's been nabbed by a competitor. They'll pay ten times that! And still burn this place down. [groaning] Someone that big, they pay, and then they take out everyone just to protect their intellectual property. [grunting] Okay, so what do we do then, Jimmy? [indistinct] What do we do? Only thing that'll stop them is if they're sure the girl is dead. ♪ ♪ Get your things, kill the girl, and get the hell out. They said not to kill anyone. I'm telling you... ♪ ♪ No, no, Jimmy. This is our payday. Jimmy... Let's go. Now. I'll be back. ♪ ♪ What are we gonna do? ♪ ♪ Kim, get your stuff. You heard him. ♪ ♪ No, Ma, leave that. I'm not leaving this behind if we're not coming back. We're coming back, all right? [indistinct speech] But for now, we do what Jimmy says. Ugh! [gagging] [gasping] ♪ ♪ Shut up. [gagging] Shh, shh, shh, shh. Yeah, get all that... put it in here. ♪ ♪ All right. Kim? ♪ ♪ I'll take care of it, all right? Get him out of here first. ♪ ♪ Kim, let's go! Kim? Kim. ♪ ♪ [gun clicks] [silenced gunfire] [screams] ♪ ♪ Whoa. You're safe. No one's gonna hurt you. I'm Julian. Your mother sent me to bring you home. [somber music] ♪ ♪ Okay? We have to move quickly. Let's go. ♪ ♪ [door opens] [gun cocks] Hold your fire. ♪ ♪ The risk is contained. CNR is complete. Status of hostiles? [whimpering] ♪ ♪ I eliminated all the targets, sir. ♪ ♪ She needs medical attention. ♪ ♪ Come on. ♪ ♪ Hope your loyalty serves you well. Oh, Laura. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. It's okay. It's okay. The doctor will fix everything. It's gonna be okay. Tell me what really happened. You have to understand. If I had paid them, it would've made everything so much worse for you. No, not me. Dad. What happened to Dad? Sweetheart. You know what happened. No, no, I know what you told me... that you tried everything to save him, but the rescue team couldn't make it in time. That's right. [exhales] You are such a liar. Listen, you have had a very traumatizing experience. Even the kidnappers seemed to know how Spiga deals with abductions. Maybe the two of you should speak privately. Oh, why? So that she can sell me more of her bullshit? Laura... If the company saved people, then you wouldn't have had to send him to save me. [dramatic music] All these years, pretending you were so devastated they couldn't get to him in time. I was devastated. Did you really think that I would never find out? You were only a child... You owe me the truth! I owe you? I risked everything for you. Not just my career, but my life. And I did it to save you. Which proves you could've saved Dad if you wanted to. ♪ ♪ Uh, the doctor is waiting. ♪ ♪ Why don't we have her look at your ear? ♪ ♪ You could've told her the truth. ♪ ♪ She's safer this way. ♪ ♪ Besides, she adored Paul, and it's better that she hate me than hate him. I'm glad she's home. Thanks. And thank you for your help with the transfer. Oh, um... I did everything I could. Gates vetoed it. Connor's moving up the ladder, and when he goes, I'll make sure that you get his position. I never wanted his position. ♪ ♪ [sighs] You're the only one I can trust. ♪ ♪ Can you tell me where it hurts? My ear. My arm. [sobbing] It's okay. I'm sorry. No need to apologize. It's okay. Sorry, I'm sorry. This... is the best part of the job. [warm music] ♪ ♪ You can't convince me that I don't have the best job in the world. See? It's like it never happened. ♪ ♪ Warning: that address is located outside of a secure corporate area. Do you accept? Do you accept? Do you acce... Yes. [motor humming] An exit strategy? To get Elena out, I need to get Inazagi's attention. How? I'm planning an operation based on intel we got from a defector. This should help move up the timetable. You think this'll work? It has to. My dad was passed out in the hall when I came home the other night. You talk to him? I've got nothing to say to him. He thinks she's dead. Probably better that way. In 24 hours, the geolocation signal on Roger's watch will reactivate. It has to be in place before then so Spiga believes it's a natural defection. No problem. You have to get her out, Aaron. You do your part, and I will. [digital blip] Hey. Hey! How's your day going? I've been better. Just... tired. Well, you should go home and lay on the couch... watch some of those animal-clone mash-ups or something. [chuckles] You hate that stuff. I know, but I'm not there. Um, I have a patient. Your office is closed, isn't it? House call. I'll tell you about it later. All right. You okay? Yes. I am. Ha! Two more... on her. You owe me, mooch. Cash. [laughing] ♪ ♪ I'll have what they're having. ♪ ♪ Only take real coin, kid. Unload your stolen dat somewhere else. Come on, man. Belonged to a Spiga suit. I'll give you the watch... barter system. Psst... maybe we can help you out. With what? 50 for the watch. 200. No way. How do I even know it works? It's a gamble, I guess. ♪ ♪ 75. He was gonna trade it for two shots. Shut up. I bring them this, the entire Inazagi board will fellate my toes. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Hey, come on, guys, get back to work, 'kay? All right, man. Don't relax. Let's go. ♪ ♪ I don't work for you anymore. I know. Take me to the girl. ♪ ♪ All of this for that goddamn girl. First Peterson, now Roger Caplan. I'm beginning to think it was an inside job. Only one person benefits of all this. Idea? You said I should tell you everything, right?
