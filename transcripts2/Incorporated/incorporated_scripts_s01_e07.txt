 Previously on "Incorporated"... 
 Even though you may not realize your dream of attending college, there could be a place for you in the Spiga family. 
 Elena, if you sign this, you'll be giving up everything. 
 If you love me, forget about me. 
 Turn that off! 
 I got orders to execute his NDA. 
 Scrub his memory. 
 Everyone thinks that they know what I went through, but they don't. 
 I've been having the episodes again. 
 [gasping] 
 We no longer rely on outdated interrogation techniques. 
 We can now literally turn people's brainwaves into usable images and actionable intelligence. 
 It's going to be operational within the month. 
 What's this intel I've risked my career for? 
 There's this whiz kid. 
 Sanjay Maraj. 
 If you could make your crops salt-tolerant... 
 Then that's how you conquer the desert. 
 And Sanjay is about to. 
 I need you to get me into Arcadia. 
 What is this about? 
 It's about Ben Larson. 
 I don't know Ben Larson. 
 You're a skint from the 'fugee camp who assumed a Green Zone identity. 
 [gagging] 
 I can't let you hurt my family! 
 I have a plan, Theo. 
 You have to trust me. In 24 hours, the geolocation signal on Roger's watch will reactivate. It has to be in place before then, so Spiga believes it's an actual defection. Where are you gonna send him? South. You're a real piece of sh1t, Aaron. I know. [wind rustling] [electricity crackling] [high-pitched tone] Ooh. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Please don't be a fishhook. No fishhook, no fishhook. Please don't be a fishhook. No fishhook, no fishhook. [sighs] Cock and balls. We've scavenged this sh1t dry, man. We're never gonna hit quota. Yeah, you know how many fishhooks it takes to feed my family? You don't have a family. Hey, hey. Get the strip. Get the strip. Oh, yeah. [dramatic music] ♪ [tires popping] ♪ I'm supposed to be taking my kid to the Scott Walker exhibit at the state capitol today. I need your help with Everclear. You've got 35 coders downstairs. And I don't trust a single one of them with what's in my head. Oh, well, hooray for me. I'm stuck, okay? Everclear can read thoughts, but I don't need to see every single one. Fine. What do you want me to do? I need you to ask me about Roger Caplan. [instrumental music] ♪ All of this for that goddamn girl. [overlapping voices] Elena! You've got a family now. So do I, but you're risking both our lives. Enough. Forget about me. Aaron! Enough. Fine. Where is Roger Caplan? He knew who I was. [overlapping voices] ♪ Hello, Aaron. Pause it. Make an image loop. [overlapping voices] Reduce the speed. He knew who I was. Hello, Aaron. Stop it there. Isolate the nodes for that memory. What the... the brick? It's not just a brick. ♪ Okay, got it. Turn off everything else. ♪ Ask me again. ♪ You are giving them the technology to destroy us, Ben. Roger Caplan. Stubborn asshole. Where is Roger Caplan? [strained shouting] You're gonna destroy everything. I can't let you hurt my family. Hello, Aaron. He knew who I was. He knew who I was. He knew who I was. Jesus, what did you do? I had no choice. The body's gone, and everything is under control. ♪ Under control? Congratulations, Ben. You just solved Everclear. You'll probably get your promotion too. And all you had to do was kill some schmuck. ♪ [somber music] I remember sitting there, looking at my mom and saying, "Why?" Such a specific memory, you know? The world was a treacherous place. And the government... It was like they were powerless to do anything about it. ♪ We spent three days trapped in an old department store... Family of four, no food, no water, whole town burning down. And then they came. Not FEMA, not the National Guard... Spiga. They were there. They didn't even have an office in the Northeast, let alone Boston. Then they gave me a job. They saved our lives. [triumphant music] That's why I voted for the amendment. That's why I voted for the amendment. Today marks the anniversary of the ratification of the 29th Amendment,  granting corporations the sovereignty we needed and deserved, an act which freed us from the incompetence, regulations, and tyranny of the federal government. We make our own laws. We supply the security. We do the things which government is no longer able to do. That is why we mark this occasion by spending it with the people we love. God bless America. And God bless Spiga. [applause] To the company. To free beer. [upbeat music] Where the hell's Caplan? I haven't seen him. You know him. Probably blowing a senior VP. Getting ahead by giving head. What's happening with Everclear? Uh, done. Submitted this morning. Listen, when you get that promotion, do me a favor. Make sure I don't have to report to Roger. I'll see what I can do. Hey, where's your wife? Well, it was definitely infected. Guy at the chop shop said he knew what he was doing. No, it was done competently, but if you don't sterilize properly... Will you hand me the butterfly strips out of that bag? Yeah, those bandages there. Okay. So the anesthesia should keep her out for a few hours, and then after that she needs to take it easy. Got it. Okay. Oh, sh1t. I've got to get going. Okay, uh, these are the butterfly strips in case the wound opens up again. Oh, no, hold on. These are antibiotics. She needs to take these twice daily. You're not coming back. [exhales sharply] I'm sorry, Rachel. I just, I... I can't. [coughing] [sighs] [electronic blips] Hmm. Yolanda says we're gonna have a play date with Zoe. How's Wednesday for you? Oh, jeez, we have plans. I'm not sure. Maybe we could do a barbecue over the weekend, hmm? Wow, yeah. That'd be great. We'll be in touch. Jasmine? Why don't you get all of us some dessert? [chuckles] What was that about? Just another play date that'll never happen. They think their dumb kid is gonna say something that'll get them in trouble. I'm sorry. These people are scared of us, Julian. Well, my position... I know. And honestly, I don't care what they think. I just don't want it in my face. I understand. [electronic blip] I'm sorry, love. Make it up to me later? You bet. Roger Caplan's watch just came online at Inazagi Center. He defected? Or was kidnapped. Either way, our internal security is compromised. We have to assume that Inazagi knows that Diana Walters defected. It means they may know what we're planning to do. Which is? To extract Dr. Sanjay Maraj. He's a gene splicer at Inazagi. Maraj's location is classified, but we have access to a man who knows where he is for a short window. You want me to use Everclear. The doctor's handler is former black ops. So the Quiet Room will take too long. Are you confident in its abilities? Absolutely. [foreboding music] ♪ [breathing heavily] Here. Yeah. ♪ Yeah, get the door. Get the door. Okay. [grunts] Oh, God. sh1t. Ugh. [alarm blaring] Oh, sh1t. Emergency beacon. Strip and run. Let's go. I woke up in the hospital after my, uh... [chuckles] Third liver transplant. And my insurance company told me that would be the last one they'd cover. So, uh, I had no choice. My life had to change. And here I am. Can't even tell my employers I come here, but if it wasn't for the program, I would be roadkill. And that's why this chip means so much to me. Thanks for listening. Would've been two and a half years if it hadn't been for that slip. Philip, what do I always say? One foot in front of the other. Exactly. See you next week? Yeah, thanks. [men shouting] [muffled yell] [dark music] [grunting] [indistinct radio chatter] [grunts] [laughs softly] Julian Morse. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry for all this unpleasantness, Mr. Brill. Oh, please, call me Philip. We need Sanjay Maraj's location. Well, uh, the second I tell you that, you're gonna put a bullet in my head, so, uh, pass. Sorry, but I got time on my side. You don't check in, they move him, but that's okay. With any luck, I don't need you to talk. Do tell. This that, uh, mind-reading device you guys have been screwing with? 'Cause our intel said it wasn't anywhere near ready. So it's a pretty big throw, don't you think? Get to work. Here we go. ♪ Who are you? [exhales sharply] ♪ Looks like we're getting parity. Why the sudden leap in quality? Data overflow was making it useless. So we narrowed it down to the visual cortex. Closest thing to an unedited memory. Huh. Nice work. Sanjay Maraj. ♪ Give it a few seconds. ♪ That the guy? Indeed. Good. Where is Sanjay Maraj? You really think they'd tell me that? ♪ What the hell is that? I don't know. [chuckles] We don't have time for this, Ben. Fix it. ♪ Oh, yeah, that-a-boy. Keep up that pace, buddy. Oh, yeah. Go, hard! Hard! [grunting, blows falling] Yeah, that's it! Hey, there's my favorite suit. Lionel. Thanks for coming over the wall. Sure. I appreciate you letting my guy knock off some of the ring rust. He's a work of art. I paid his parents to mate. I adopted the best of the litter. Brought him home with me to the Green Zone. That yours? Yeah, he's green, but he's talented. Undefeated in seven. Not bad for a little man. He took out Sayeed. Guy's three times his size. [grunting, blows falling] Heavy hands. Mm. Yeah. Hasn't been at it long. Pure potential. I bet. Maybe you'd be interested in, uh, swapping stakes. I'll give you a percentage of my guy for a piece of yours. Nice work, boy. Nice work. Hey, kid. Come here. Get down here. Spit it out. Closer. Gums are kind of raw. Vitamin D deficiency. What's his diet? Uh, he eats well... Three squares a day. Right, kid? [laughs] Most days. Hmm. What about enhancements? Knucks, bone re-generators? Nah, he doesn't need 'em, man. Kid's a natural. See Yaroslav? We fluff his blood twice daily. We inject his muscles with pure growth hormone. He consumes 2,000 calories of pure protein per day. He is perfection. You want to swap stakes? 1% of my guy for 90% of yours. ♪ If you feel so strongly about him, why don't we put a wager on it? I thought they were just sparring. 15 large. Unless you want to make it 20. ♪ Well? ♪ We searched Caplan's office. This is all we found. It's a keyhole. Lets you access the datasphere without leaving any tracks. Black-market tech. How did he get this past the scanners? He didn't. It's made in-house. Spiga parts throughout. Any forensic evidence? The exterior's a hyper-polished alloy. No fingerprints. Caplan built this? He'd have to be a hell of an engineer. Caplan is a climber, not a code monkey. Take this up to the analysts. Use Weinstein. Diego. Need to know only. We usually treat congenital cataracts before they form. Uh, there's an old device I think might work. I'll see if I can get my hands on one. Yeah? How much is that gonna cost me? Don't worry about it. I'll make some calls. Move! I thought this was a one-time thing. sh1t. Goran. Who is this? A doctor. Goran, I can explain. You know this is my block, right? People do business here, and I get a cut. Well, no, she's not charging anything. I don't understand. What did I do? She's just trying to help. You're giving eyesight to the blind? It's just cataracts. She's genet... Goran... Shut up. [tense music] ♪ 
 
 No, what are you doing? [screams] Let... let go! [screaming] Help! Help! Rachel! Help! Let me go! Help! ♪ What's the matter, kid? Your magic helmet letting you down? Where is Sanjay Maraj? I guess you've never heard of a fail-safe. [dramatic music] [chuckles] ♪ Holy sh1t. ♪ Mr. Brill, I need your help. [scoffs] No sh1t. But hey, tick-tock, 'cause in a few more hours, they're gonna move the gene splicer, and then it won't matter. Oh, you mean Sanjay Maraj? He's at the Inazagi Cold-Storage Facility in White Horse on the banks of the Yukon River, correct? ♪ Why am I not dead? I need something else. Why the hell would I help you? Well, simple, Mr. Brill. Because I'm gonna save your life. How is this gonna save my life? I need you to stop resisting and show me what you're most ashamed of. Go to hell. Mr. Brill, please. You want to blackmail me. Unfortunately, it's the only way you'll believe me. Believe you about what? I need safe passage for me and a friend. You want to defect? No, I want out. And when I come to you, I'll need to prove Everclear works. Please, you've shown me that it works. If everything goes to plan, you won't remember. Your shame, Mr. Brill. Show me. Stop. Stop. Please stop. [baby murmuring] [crying] ♪ Pause. Make an image loop. [baby crying] ♪ Oh. [solemn music] ♪ Oh... ♪ He had hypoxia at birth. We didn't know how much damage there was. Right. Inazagi does medical testing on the so-called "inferior." ♪ [inhales sharply] ♪ He'd already suffered enough. ♪ I killed him to spare him. ♪ Stop. I'm sorry. ♪ You're a monster. No, I'm just a guy against a wall. What the hell are you doing now? Testing a theory. ♪ I will not help you. You won't have a choice. [electronic humming] [gasping, grunting] ♪ Mr. Caplan, I appreciate your making time. Humiliating me in front of my business associates is a funny way of showing it. I apologize. But I wanted to be the one to tell you about your son. Oh, yeah? What's he done now? We're not entirely sure. Mr. Morse, I'm a busy man. We have reason to believe he may have defected. You should know better than to throw around that word. I understand it's upsetting. It's not upsetting. It's absurd. This is about the promotion. How can you be so sure? He's a mid-level screen jockey. No one's buying whatever he may be selling. Roger's smart. He's a spoiled brat. And you, Mr. Morse, you know what you are? I'm the man trying to find your son. ♪ You spoke to the girl, right? Girl? The one from Arcadia? He asked me for an outcall with her. We found a device in Roger's office with a photo on it. This girl? That's the one. [dark music] [door slams] ♪ What do you think? About what? What do you want from me? What's your name, sweetheart? You're gonna regret this. ♪ This has been my block for how long, Wallace? Five years. And yet I have no infrastructure. ♪ What the hell are you talking about? Are you a fan of world history? You know how Hamas took over Egypt? With violence. Sure, that's how they took power. But do you know how they kept it? ♪ They fixed the roads. They gave people jobs. They took care of things. ♪ So you want good PR. Hearts and minds. Eyesight to the blind, all that sh1t. The offer is very simple. I give you this space. I help you set it up. And then you get to help people. I... I don't understand. You... you... you want me to open a clinic? I want you to open my clinic. I'm sorry. Look, I just came out here to help a friend. I can't do this. ♪ [electronic whirring] [grunts] What do you want? Mr. Brill, I need your help. Yeah, no sh1t. But hey, tick-tock, 'cause in a few more hours, they're gonna move the gene splicer, and it's not gonna matter anymore. Fantastic. Mr. Morse wants an update. Good. I've got one. Where is he? Upstairs, interrogating a witness. A witness? Some girl from Arcadia. ♪ How can I help you, Mr. Morse? Roger Caplan? . I remember him. How well? Enough to know I didn't like him. He knew you well enough. Aaron, stop. Roger Caplan thought you had information on someone who was in his way. Who was he asking about? [knocking at door] Not now. Sir, it's urgent. This can wait. It can't. The gene splicer. I think I know where he is. [tense music] Think hard about your answer. I'll be right back. ♪ I don't understand. He's never seen the location. He only knows the name. Everclear is accessing the memories of what the subject has seen. Brill doesn't know what it looks like. Exactly. It's a representational image, not a literal one. May I? If we run the information through the datasphere, there it is. White Horse is the name of the town. Can you get the team up to the Yukon Territory before they move Maraj? It'll take time to plan... Time we don't have. Well, actually, I think I can buy us some. Talk fast. We can erase Mr. Brill's memory and put him back before he has to check in. Returning him brain-damaged is not a solution. Well, technically brain-damaged, but with Everclear and the NDA procedure, I think I can erase just today. Otherwise, his mind would remain intact. Think or know? Know. Inazagi won't have any idea we took him. All right. Do it. [men shouting] [grunts] This guy's gonna kill me. You want Gavros to come back? The Green Zone scout? Listen, you fight, and you win. I can't win. Of course you can. Hey. What's this? It's insurance. [grunting] Yes! Oh, yeah! ♪ [breathing heavily] ♪ [gasping] ♪ I want to see Goran. Take me to him. ♪ I'm sorry for the interruption. It's fine. Where were we? Roger Caplan. He asked you about someone. I'm not sure I'm allowed to talk about this. My dear, I'm the head of security. I decide what you get to talk about. What did Caplan want? It wasn't a big deal. He was just looking for dirt on someone he works with. All those climbers do it. Who was he asking about? Was it Ben Larson? Who? No, his boss. Chad Petersen. No, everyone's boss. Elizabeth Krauss. What? He asked if I knew her. Spent time with her. I had. Of course, I didn't tell him anything about it, but I could tell you. You said I should tell you everything, right? ♪ That won't be necessary. If I have more questions, I know where to find you. ♪ [metal whirs, clicks] War wound. The injury was handled well. Corporate clinic do that? Military hospital. Before the privatization. Nice work, right? Sure. They've made progress on biological limb replacements. I like to remember what I gave. Your offer... I thought about it. I'm listening. There are gonna be things I need: supplies, equipment. If you're gonna do this, it can't be half-assed. So you're saying yes. I'm saying we'll see. [door opens] You keep taking that out of the hyperbaric sleeve, it'll rot. Why have it if I can't read it? That bad, huh? Just the usual. Beats the alternative. One of our executives defected. Or we think he did. But? Something's not right. You're gonna think I'm crazy. Try me. First, one of our execs, Peterson, gets caught stealing files. Except Peterson doesn't fit the profile. So we executed his non-disclosure agreement, and a job opens up on the 40th. Now this defection. Guy's one of our top candidates for the promotion, and he throws it all way. Only one person benefits from all of this. So who is this mastermind? Elizabeth's son-in-law. ♪ I've got no proof, no hard evidence, just my gut. Julian. I know. I know. Ah, the hell with it. They've taken up enough of our weekend. ♪ [electronic blip] Spiga is determined to keep us celibate. ♪ Hmm. What is it? The executive I told you about. They found him. He didn't defect. He's dead.

[screaming] Get him out! Get him out! [screaming] Stop it! Stop it! [yelling] [laughing] [groaning] I'll take 99% of your guy, you get 1% of mine. How's that for a swap? [groans] Take it easy, kid. Take... take it easy. Take... hey, take it easy, kid, no one's... no one's gonna hurt you. You just need to calm down. [hyperventilating] You got to calm down. She knows how. Shh, sweet boy. Let me help. It's a little gift for a good night's work. No, no, no. No, hey. Relax, kid. No, stop, stop. I'll handle everything. St... Mm. We're mongrels, kid. [groans] We're the same.

[clears throat] And, uh, I have been sober... For one day. Welcome back, Philip. Thank you. ♪ We've got drones circling at a safe distance and full communication surveillance at the White Horse facility. So far, no changes. So it worked? It appears so. There's another problem. Roger Caplan. His body was found in a dry lake bed somewhere in Missouri. Scavengers were stripping his car when our contractors got to him. Was it Inazagi? I'm beginning to think it was an inside job. With your permission, I'd like to use Everclear on the entire department. Fine. Julian? Let's keep it quiet. Yes, ma'am. [beeping] Never thought I'd see this place again. We don't have a lot of time. Pull up a console. What's this? Plans. Microscopic text. The scanners look for tech, not organics. [machine whirs] Come on, pull up Roger Caplan's personnel file. It's been locked and transferred to security. Check for recent activity. They've issued his death benefit. They found the body. That's why they locked me out of Everclear. ♪ Oh, what are you gonna do? You gonna sell this? They'll kill you and Laura. I'm not selling it. I'm building it. ♪ Look, they're gonna use Everclear on me. You son of a bitch, I told you this... Hendrick, I need you. ♪ This is a two-man job. What is? The only way to get past Everclear... Is to erase Aaron.
