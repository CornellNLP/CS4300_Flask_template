 Previously on Incorporated... 
 Aaron! 
 Told you I'd find you. 
 Even though you may not realize your dream of attending college, there could be a place for you in the Spiga family. 
 That's a group of girls being escorted to Arcadia. 
 We got the permit. We're gonna get pregnant. 
 Chad got fired today. 
 Then we revoke his security clearance. 
 Execute his nondisclosure agreement. [grunts] Who are you? I don't know. Your husband is going after my husband's job. The house comes with it. I made you something. It's a water key. This is good. You're a skint from a fugee camp who assumed a Green Zone identity. [both grunting] Everything I'm doing is for Elena. Look at you. Are you really serious about this fighting bullshit? Anthony, I'm serious about not being dirt poor for the rest of your lives. Gavros is coming tonight. He can get us a fight beyond the wall. [smacking, crowd cheering] He's dead. [crowd cheering] We need help. What's wrong with him? He can't breathe. In here. There's this whiz kid, Sanjay Maraj. If you could make your crops salt-tolerant... Then that's how you conquer the desert. If we secure his work, I can ask the board for anything. David Gates is gunning for you. You're a monster. [grunting] We can erase Mr. Brill's memory and put him back before he has to check in. Inazagi won't have any idea we took him. You got a gut feeling about who did this? I have someone in mind. When they put me through Everclear, they'll find out about everyone. I need to lock all those memories away. Connect this to the base of my skull to bring me back or Aaron will be gone for good. If you're getting this, it's because you haven't brought me back. You have 72 hours or you cover will be blown. I think I could build a 3-D outline of what the crime scene looked like. You can get me a face? Larson, what do you see? Larson, what do you see? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Uh, the file's still rendering. The data stream turned out to be more complicated than I thought. Then send it in. If we get more eyes on it... No, with your permission, I'd like to see this through. Uh, I don't have faces yet, but I can tell you that there are two figures carrying Roger's body. The killer had an accomplice. He must have. I should know more soon. Contact me as soon as you have something. [breathing shakily] [footsteps, device beeping] Hey. [sighs] There's an emergency at the clinic. I need to go in. [sighs] Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I, uh... I need to figure something out. [device chimes] Oh. I need to go. Get some rest, okay? Whatever it is, I'm sure you'll see it better with fresh eyes. [computer chimes] Figure C, facial render complete. [dramatic music] ♪ Run facial recognition. Facial recognition successful. 87% match. [crowd cheering, blows landing] [cheering continues] ♪ There he is. You need a new nickname, bro. How about "Malaria"? Small but deadly? Where you going? [indistinct chatter, engines rumbling] [hip-hop music playing] [indistinct chatter, steam hissing] Go grab the other unit. [monitors beeping] I just want to thank you both... If you want to thank us, clean up and get in there. Your heart took a beating, but your hands work just fine. [device whirring] [sighs] There are too many fragments. Her body is literally riddled with buckshot. Hoppers aren't the best shots. This way, their bosses make sure they hit something. She's losing too much blood. Get me nanosutures. Okay, take this. [suction machine whirring] I need more. That was the last one. We just got a new shipment yesterday. sh1t. [heart monitor beeps in steady tone] [machinery whirring] [suction machine whirring] [instruments clatter, steady tone stops abruptly] [sighs] [sighs] You did everything you could. Bullshit. I have a whole closet of nanosutures at my old clinic. [sighs] We use 'em in the Total Body Rejuvenation package. Hey, we got a sick kid here. Doc! There's something wrong with his stomach. The guy who dropped him off said he found him like this. [sighs] Oh. Hmm. Well, whatever's in there is definitely infected. I need to cut him open. [mellow lounge music] I'm so glad you were able to take the day off work. Oh, I've taken off more than just the day. I have booked us a week on the East Siberian Sea. Fine dining, scuba camp for the boys, you know, quality family time, just the four of us. Oh. Chad. Now, what do we have here? [laughs] Oh. [music distorts] Mmm! Delicious! Mmm. Corinne has just outdone herself. Mmm. [indistinct chatter] [low, suspenseful music] ♪ [footsteps tapping] [gasps] [both grunting] [panting] Jesus, Aaron. What are you doing sneaking up on me like that? Who the hell is Aaron? Worldwide, average yearly rainfall has decreased by over 70%. Almost 1/4 of the world's population is currently suffering from drought-induced starvation. But there is a solution... One that literally surrounds us. If we could harness the vast salt water reserves of our oceans for agriculture, well, we could feed the world. All we need is the will and the funding, of course. [crowd laughs and murmurs] Turn it off. "All we need is the funding." I was so naive. No, you were right. Salt content's 1.4% and holding. Almost halfway to being useful. And that's the excess adenosine and Melatonin talking. How about a pick-me-up? [injector hisses] [grunts] Let's, uh, get to work, then. Let's decrease the water temperature in tank four. If we continue to replicate post-arctic conditions... [electricity surging] [lights click, machinery whirs] What's happening? [device beeps] Coms are out. Must be a drill. [muffled gunfire] That's not a drill. [rapid beeping] [explosions] [door thuds] Targets acquired. Stay where you are. Nobody move. Don't move! [gunshots] No! On full screen. Let's move it. You're safe. Don't worry. The antibodies will disable the Kusari. Negative. No go. We're taking off. Dr. Maraj? [alarms blaring] That's quarantine right there. Dr. Maraj... We're gonna need you to come with us. If you want my research to continue on pace, I'm gonna need my drives and all the seeds in the refrigeration unit. I am trying to save half the world's population from starving. Which corporation profits from it makes no difference to me. [device hisses, alarms blaring] Materials secure. Let's move out. Head to the extraction point. On the double. Move, move, move, move, move. Jesus, what happened to them? Neurotoxic gas. They didn't feel a thing. Don't worry, Dr. Maraj, we're the good guys. Hands on the target. Good. Get him here alive, and there's a promotion in it for all of you. Aaron, I need you to listen. I'm not Aaron. You grew up in a refugee camp. I grew up in Seattle with my parents. We had a pool and a dog named Buster. A pool? You got your left arm broken stealing water rations. I broke my arm para-sailing on Lake Union. This is... I don't know what this is. But I'm not taking the fall for Roger's murder. You killed him. You did it for Elena. I told you I don't know her. You have loved her since you were kids. I love my wife. Your wife. Laura. You met her when she spilled punch on your suit at the company picnic. That's right. You reeled her in. Probably f*cked her that night, but it was all an act. And she was dumb enough to fall for it. [thudding, both grunting] [panting] I knew you were in there somewhere, Aaron. This is insane. [device chimes] Hey, Theo. It's me, your big sis. If you're watching this, that means Melissa's managed to escape and given you Mom's ring. That's her. That's Elena. We both were transferred from the executive club in Buenos Aires... I bought a ring for Laura that looks just like this. I don't give a sh1t about Laura. You  don't give a sh1t about Laura. This is your family. Wait. That guy in the background. He works in HR. He lives down the street. Hendrick. Jonathan Hendrick. That's Henry Reed. He's a reffo skint, just like us. Security is neutralized. We're heading for air transport now. Contact us when you're airborne. Copy. [door hisses] [wind roaring] Air transport is MIA. Standing by for command. Widen for the helicopter. There. Mohave 5-1-7, come in. Mohave 5-1-7, do you copy? Losing altitude. We've been hacked from the ground. Code looks like... Inazagi. Christ. The mission's burned. Ma'am, Mohave 5-1-7's on a collision course with the mountain. Mohave 5-1-7, can you hear us? Come on. Pull up. What's that? Inazagi troop carriers. If they get Maraj... I am aware of what happens if they get Maraj. We've got ground rescue on the way. Our best chance is to dig in, wait for reinforcements. This was supposed to be a covert mission. The second Inazagi sees Spiga ground support, you've started a war. [yelps] Oh, it's okay, Sam. My name's Dr. Larson. You've just come out of an emergency surgery. What happened? Do you remember having a surgery before this? This is an implant that ruptured in your body. It was releasing a medicine called Sub-Androgen into your blood. You took out my implant? I need that. It's a hormone inhibitor. It was stunting your growth. That's the point. Do you know how much tricks will pay to be with a little boy? I need you to listen to me, Sam. The things that happened to you, they're not your fault. You're a child, and you're not capable of consent. I'm 19, bitch. You don't know anything about me. I had it put in when I was 12 because I needed to keep my job. The woman I work for gives me enough money so my brothers and sisters won't have to do this sh1t. She makes sure the customers don't hurt me. I know it's hard to see, but you have other options. No, I don't. Safe in the brothel or dead on the street: those are my options. You have to put the implant back. [grunts] [sighs] [horn honks] Yeah, please have Mr. Hendrick call me when he gets in. Thank you. He's out of the office all day with a family emergency. He didn't pick up his personal. So find him. I don't even know where to look. Is this what you're like when you're Ben? 'Cause he's a whiny little bitch. [muttering indistinctly] And there's a big building and... and an elevator, and I have a meeting. I can't... can't be late. Mr. Peterson? Oh, it's me, Ben. Ben. Yeah, Ben Larson from Spiga. [distant hip-hop music playing] Ben Larson. Ben Larson from Spiga. I've never seen that before! It was all Ben's idea. [screams] You... You did this to me. I'm sorry? You! [both grunting] [smacks and thuds] [sobbing] What the hell was that about? I have no clue. So where does Hendrick go when he's not at home or work? I don't know. I don't even know where I've been in the past two days. [screen beeps] What are you doing? I may not know where I've been, but the GPS does. [screen beeps] Work. Home. [screen beeps] What about that? Where is that? It's a squat over in Franklin Heights. Why would I go there? I don't know. Aaron's not the best communicator. [sighs] [computer chiming] [sighing] [computer chimes] DNA verification required. Oh, f*ck me. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. f*ck! The rescue team hit severe weather en route. It'll be close, but they still should get there in time. When Laura was nine, we took her to the glaciers. She'd been asking to go for months. She'd seen an old nature documentary at school. I kept telling her that things had changed, that it wasn't gonna look like the movie. Then we got there, and I watched her face as she looked out over this vast expanse of barren slush. There was this gift shop in the middle that sold ice cream and... She went very quiet. I could feel how disappointed she was. Disappointed in us for letting it come to that. And then there's Maraj. Hmm. His research could change the world. God, if we could only leave one thing better than we found it. [computer chimes] The extraction team has an update. Commander says she needs to speak with you right away. [speaks Arabic] _ [speaks Arabic] _ What the f*ck was that? Uh, I don't know. [chair scrapes] Now what? I have no idea. Should I go ask them? [switch clicks, electronic chime] [switch clicks, electronic whirring] [switches clicking] [ticking] What are you doing? [switches clicking] [heavy thud, metallic clatter] Dumb luck? No. Muscle memory. [hinges creak] What did you do to me? [chuckles] What did  I  do to  you? [men shouting, muffled explosions] Dr. Maraj, stay inside. We're taking heavy fire. Bring up the satellite feed. They're surrounded. All we can do is fortify. Where is the rescue team? The storm is picking up. They won't make it in time. [distant explosions, gunfire] You need to surrender. You need to get back inside, Dr. Maraj. You can trade your lives for my research. They'll take the deal. [gunfire] [distant explosions, gunfire] [beeps] Move the standby drones into position. What are you doing? Our people are in there. Maraj is in there. His research is in there. If Inazagi gets his research, it will lower the price of Spiga's grain by 98%. Spiga will go out of business and hundreds of thousands of employees will be expelled into the Red Zone, if not NDA'd. Millions of people will starve to death without him. We're not accountable to them. We're accountable to our shareholders. The drones are in position, ma'am. Activate the strike. Activate the strike. That is an order. [explosions, alarm blaring] [beep] Activate. We erased Aaron? Must be nice, getting to press a button and forget what you've done. You want to know who you are, ask the system. Blood doesn't lie. Do it. [needle hisses] Identity accepted. Thank you, Aaron Sloane. Program H disabled. Blackmail... Outing me to everyone at Spiga if I didn't bring you back. If you want to be Aaron, here. Pop that in the back of your neck, and he gets restored. But just so you know, the man locked away on that thing, he's a monster. Aaron put my seven-year-old daughter's life at risk. He married his wife for a promotion. He's a lying, murdering piece of sh1t who lays waste to everything he touches, and we're all better off without him. Elena isn't better off without him. Elena chose to sign that contract. She was 17. You can't let her die out there. Ben, you worked hard to get where you are. You're happy. That's what you told me. It's a lie. You can build a wall around your bullshit Green Zone life, but Elena is still out there. Stop. I need to get out of here. Where the f*ck do you think you're going? If you come anywhere near me, I swear to God, I'll break this, and it'll all be over. [machinery hissing, beeping] [sighs] The chairman would like a word. [high-pitched beep] Chairman Fisher. Ms. Krauss. Mr. Gates, thank you for joining us. The board convened an emergency session to review your actions today. Your mission failed. You lost Dr. Maraj and our best extraction team. Your actions risked open warfare with Inazagi. However, the board recognizes the value of Dr. Maraj as an asset and the importance of keeping that asset out of Inazagi hands. In the face of extraordinary circumstances, your vision was clear and your loyalty to our shareholders unwavering. In light of all this, the board commends you on rising to the occasion. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Gates, thank you for representing the board in Milwaukee today. Of course, Chairman. [hologram hums] Your ego nearly started a war. The chairman doesn't seem to agree. She hasn't seen what I have. She'll come to her senses when she hears your daughter's running a clinic on the other side of the wall, like a walking security breach. Can't even keep track of your own family. How can you be expected to lead this office? [indistinct conversation] Oh, it's been a while... [indistinct conversation] How is he? Fine. Well, he's not fine, but the procedure was successful. I looked for the nanosutures. The lock on the cabinet wasn't broken. They had a key. Hmm. Who would steal nanosutures? Smugglers. Cartels pay people, they cut them open. They use the nanosutures to sew the stolen goods back inside. Jesus. What should we do about it? I don't know yet. [water trickling] Hey. How'd you know Bowie? You're a fighter too. Yeah. I'm sorry. I know it must be difficult for you knowing what happened to him. I'm glad he has friends here. I love my brother. But he was lost. Always after the next thing, needing the spoils of this life. I felt sorry for him. I know that's your world too. I have no choice. Everyone has a choice. Bowie and I grew up scrounging the same trash heaps for the same scraps of food. When we grew older, I chose the monastery. And he chose the money, the fame. That's what killed him: chasing the ephemeral. What was your name? I really should go. I'm sorry. You're the one who killed him. Come join us. I really shouldn't. Please. You're here. I forgive you. [sobbing] No. Don't... [sobbing] [men laughing and shouting in the distance] Ben Larson. [distorted noises] Who are you? Ben La... Ben Larson. [whispering] Wait. Ben Larson. Ben Larson. Ben. Ben Larson. You did this. You did this to me. [both grunting] [thudding, man groaning] [Chad whimpering] [Chad grunts] [panting] [grunts] Should I be worried? I need that fancy tequila that Mark and Dorie gave us at our wedding. 30-year-old tequila? Your day was that bad? I think it's in the back here. Okay. [grunts] Yeah. [grunts] [sighs] [sniffs] [groans] Smells pretty serious. [gulps] Come on. You used to be able to drink me under the table. I think I was a different person back then. [gulps] [sighs] So what's going on? Work thing? [sighs] I just... I keep thinking that I can help people or change something, but I'm not changing anything, not really. I'm just... I'm... patching holes. How many lives have you saved? What does it matter? I mean, what, if I save them, the f*ck are they going back to? [sighs] Would it make any difference at all if I just walked away? [sighs] You're amazing. [chuckles] Yeah, well, remember that tomorrow when we're both hung over and somebody has to make breakfast. [laughs] Yeah, I'll try. I'll always try. [sighs] But tomorrow, even if I forget to tell you, that won't make it any less true. I don't deserve you. ♪ [ominous music] ♪ [sighs] [dramatic music] ♪ I'm so sorry. No! Dad! [glass shatters] [screams] No. Do it first... Elena? Tell me! [dramatic music continues] ♪ [electronic whir] [dreamy music] ♪ [keys jingle] Hey, there, Champ. You're such hot sh1t you don't have to come to workouts anymore? Normally, that's the kind of thing that would burn me up. But that scout, Gavros, he liked the damage you did the other night. You got us a Green Zone fight, kid, just like I knew you would. The thing is, some guys lose their taste for the cage after they take it all the way. I'm fine. I know you are. You have to be. 'Cause tomorrow you're gonna step right back in the cage, and you're gonna show those arrogant f*cks the killer they paid for. You're gonna make me proud, aren't you, Theo? You wanted to see me? Yes. The suspects from the wind-contour model. I ran the data twice. I thought it had to be a mistake, but... Did facial recognition confirm? 87% match to Chad Peterson. And this is... The wind was at his back. I wasn't able to extract a face from the data. We executed Peterson's nondisclosure agreement. I'm sure you know what that means. Yes. And yet you think he had the presence of mind, the ability, to not only kill Roger Caplan but to manipulate the car's GPS and send it out of town? I don't think anything, sir. I just rendered the data. But one thing I've learned from Everclear is, you know, memory is tough. Sometimes it just won't stay buried. Mr. Larson, how are you? Feeling like my usual self again. That's just wonderful. I'm sorry, about everything. [scoffs] I can promise you, all of this will be over soon. Yeah, well, it probably will be. I got a request from one of the board members for personnel files of several of the companions at Arcadia, Elena included. The word is, they're cleaning house. You can understand why they're nervous, given all their recent security breaches. Why didn't you tell me? Well, I didn't think it would concern you, Ben. Look, I just need to... Yeah, I don't care what you need. You and I are done. [aerosol bottle hisses] [aerosol bottle hisses] Shouldn't we change the locks? Whoever it is, I want to catch them. Well, I see you took our conversation about undue risk to heart. I am a grown woman. I make my own decisions. You are the daughter of a high-level Spiga executive and the wife of a rising star at the company. Was one kidnapping not enough for you? Don't you dare. It's only a matter of time before one of these patients works that out, and then your husband and I are left to buy back whatever's left. Then don't pay. Let them kill me, like you did with Dad. Problem solved. You don't know the first thing about your father. I know that you could have saved him, and you chose to let him die. I couldn't save him, Laura... Because he was never kidnapped. He was defecting. He was selling proprietary seed lines to Inazagi. What happened to Chad Peterson's family, that would have been us. That would have been you. I did what I had to, as your mother, to keep you safe. So... You didn't let him die. You had him killed. The second he decided to defect, he sealed his fate. He almost destroyed us. I love you too much to let your idealism do the same. Close the clinic, or I will. Come in, Ben. Have a seat. Is everything all right? Before we can continue, I need to be sure that you are who you say you are. [machinery whirs] We need to verify your identity with a blood sample. [needle hisses] Identity confirmed. Ben Larson. Bureaucracy. You understand. I spoke with the board today. The promotion? It's yours, Ben. Congratulations. Welcome to the 40th floor.

I'm sure I don't have to tell you the talk there is looser than the talent. Mm. Now, before we go too far down this road, what do you want? I'm sorry? In exchange for your help.
