 Hi! Hey, hey, hey... 
 Hey! 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 We're taking you out, bro. 
 That's right. 
 Mm-mm. 
 You're gonna come out dancing... with us. 
 Both (in rhythm) : Come dancing, with us. 
 Hey, I'm not going dancing with you. 
 I'd-I'd-I'd feel like a third wheel. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Well, it's a couples thing. 
 It'd be super-awkward and weird. 
 No. What? that's insane. You're being insane. 
 Yeah. Okay... 
 You're not gonna spend another Saturday playing video games. 
 Hmm? 
 Yeah, okay, I'll... 
 (sighs) I'll come for a little bit. 
 Yes! 
 Yeah! All right, let's go. 
 Ding, ding, ding! 
 All right, let's go. 
 Uh, guys, when you said dancing, I really thought you meant, like, at a club or a bar. 
 No. We meant competitive ice dancing. 
 What? 
 Leo : Buckle up. 
 Bruce douglas :  Welcome back to the Couples Invitational. 
 Now on the ice, the lovely Liz and Leo. ♪ ♪ And... Josh. ♪ ♪ Is it just me, or does Josh seem like a third wheel? Oksana baiul :  Yes, this is couples thing. Josh being with them is super-awkward and weird. Douglas :  Now, why is he pointing and waving? What's that about? Baiul :  He's trying to make it seem like he sees friends. Like he is popular guy? Douglas :  That's not gonna fool the judges. ♪ ♪ Baiul :  Oh, Liz and Leo are a match made in heaven. Douglas :  Two bodies moving perfectly as one. Let's check back in with Josh. Oh, dear. Baiul :  Now he's doing that thing where you pretend to get a text. Douglas :  Yes, from this angle, you can see that his phone is clearly turned off. He's texting on a blank screen. (crowd booing)  And the crowd knows it. And they're not happy, quite frankly. Ooh! Baiul :  Hmm, he should've stayed home and masturbated himself. Douglas :  I would've. Man Seeking Woman - 01x07 Stain Man : Hey, Josh. Hey. Water. Oh. Okay. Oh, (bleep), (bleep). You got... you got water now. Ev-Everybody's got water. Okay, have a good one. Oh, you, too. Do you know when you might need me again? We'll let you know, Jeff. Oh, okay. Jeff? Bill, bill, junk mail, boring-ass letters. Dude, your mail sucks. Oh, I just got this. Ben and Becky's wedding invitation. You're going, right? Yeah, I don't know. Weddings... weddings kind of stress me out. What? Why? Because all our friends are, like, coupled up, and they have terrific jobs, and I'm single, and... oh, God, the sun. Uh, and I'm just a temp. Come on, dude, you got to go. It's Ben and Becky. Okay, what if Maggie's there? I'm serious, I don't think I could... I heard she's dating some... new banker guy. Don't worry, they're not gonna be there, okay? Come on. Just say you're in. I don't... Say you're in. I don't know. Who's in? Who's in? There's little Josh's smile. Okay, all right. There's that little smile. Okay, I'm in, I'm in. There you go. When is this thing? July 25, in hell. What? July 25, it's a Saturday. Yeah, no, the other thing. Oh, the wedding's in hell. See? It's a destination wedding. Yep, come on. Let's go shopping. Oh, my God. Can't believe I wasted all this money on a lightweight suit. Dude, we're going to hell in July. You're gonna want something that breathes. Okay, one more stop. What? Oh, come on. (bell dings) Do we really have to buy swords? Their wedding Web site said holy weaponry suggested. I read the Web site, I'm just saying I'm only gonna use it once. It's just gonna take up space in my closet. Going to hell? Oh, my God. You know it. Yeah, we're, uh, we're real excited about it. Do you have anything that is under $40? This one is $90. And it's our most basic model. Why's it so cheap? Well, the, uh, blade is unengraved, the handle is synthetic and it's cursed. It's cursed? Yes, everyone who's bought it has been murdered. You said $90? No sword for me. That's right. For $90... you ain't gonna do much better than that, bro. Okay, well, I'm not made of $90. Thank you. What about you, my friend? Uh, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba... Let's go pewter this time. Pewter. The man's metal. Good choice. Might I suggest a goatskin sheathe? Andros, you old b*st*rd, you know me better than I know myself. You got it. Mm. She's a beauty. Definitely put this on my tab. Will do. Ka! Whoa, Christ... Christ Almighty. Hey, how happy do you think Becky is right now? I-I don't know... Over the moon, right? Y... Uh... Is that what you were gonna say? N... Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. Okay. Hey, how you doing? Hey, you know how Ben proposed? No. Put it in a fortune cookie. Oh. And then he lost it. Oh. And then  she  found it. Okay. They're telling me the story...  I  lost it. (laughs) Oh, yeah. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, this wedding's gonna be the best. Dancing, open bar. Open bar, there's always a tip jar. So you end up paying anyway. Oh, wouldn't it be amazing if the ring was white gold? I, uh... No, not really. Ah. Becky's getting married in her grandma's wedding dress. Isn't that adorable? No, she's probably just trying to save money. Oh, man, I love it when they cut the cake and they wipe it all over each other's faces. You mean-You mean, like every single wedding? I hope they write their own vows. You know, to personalize 'em? Yeah, you're right. 'Cause getting married is so unique. ♪ Here comes the bride, do, do, do-do. ♪ Oh, for (bleep) sake. I smell wedding. Ugh. (rattling) Welcome, gentlemen.
