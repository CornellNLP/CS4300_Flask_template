 Previously on "Six"... 
 If we do not get $10 million in one week, I will cut his head off. 
 We identified an abandoned village, which we believe may be where the hostages are being held. 
 But I don't want this SEAL to distract you from our goal. 
 We can use him. For the cause. 
 The price is $10 million. 
 I will agree to your price if I see the SEAL first. 
 Man :  Be advised... four-vehicle package moving north on north-south dirt road. 
 Caulder : Or it could be a kill team coming in to take out the hostages. 
 We'd be going in blind. 
 It's day... zero tactical advantage. 
 This is what we came for... Rip and those girls. 
 Going in... now. 
 Chase : We got a man down behind the southwest building. 
 How bad? 
 He's urgent surgical. 
 Graves : This is Delta One. We need immediate CASEVAC. 
 Reaper Two-Two, this is Foxtrot Delta One. 
 CASEVAC outbound, break. 
 What does ISR have on vehicles egressing from the north? 
 Delta One, Reaper Three-Three. 
 They are under tree cover at this time. 
 Do not have visual. PJ said Buck was bleeding out. Just stay on task. Chase, Buddha, and I will recheck the huts. Caulder, Fish, check for bodies, gather intel... cellphones, whatever you can find. Bashir! [Speaking Chechen] _ Stay in the forest. The trees shield us. They were Americans. I know it. If any of our men survived, they will break them, Michael. We cannot stay in Africa. We take the hostages to the facility in Chad, as planned. Muttaqi will have us both shot. We are dead men. Is the stupid SEAL worth that? Yes. He is. Muttaqi will understand, even if you don't. [Helicopter blades whirring] Who are they? I don't know, but they know what they're doing. And that gunfire after, what was that? No talking! You ever see an AK rigged like this? Look at his kit. These shit-birds aren't BH. How many? Eight. These are soldiers... trained, geared up, armored. We got eight confirmed Kilos, at least one with comms, rail system on his gun, lasers. All right, bag him and take him to the safe house. Roger. Poor girls, man. Bag the bowl. We need to gather DNA evidence, see if Rip was here. Roger that. [Sighs] Delta One, this is Foxtrot Two-Two. ISR unable to locate vehicles departing the target area. Will notify if this changes. Roger that. Look at this. Rip was here. We just missed him. All stations, this is Delta One. We have confirmation that Taggart was just here. Over. Foxtrot Two-Two copies. Be advised... the Nigerian army is en route. You have 10 minutes. Roger that. All right, Delta, let's... let's wrap this up. We got to get out of here. Delta One, Delta Four. Found a fresh grave on east side of building one-one. Over. Over here! We need a shovel. We have to move, man. Give me a goddamn shovel. Come on, help me. It could be Rip. All right. I got him. Come on! Come on. It's not Rip. Neither is this one. Let's get 'em out! [Grunting] Foxtrot Two-Two, this is Delta One. Do we have sitrep on the CASEVAC? Over. Delta One, Foxtrot Two-Two. Your wounded is now KIA. Roger that. Buck didn't make it. Hey, boys! Damn. We beat the chaplain. I got this from here. Where's that asshole husband of mine? ♪ ♪ [Sobbing] No! No! No! Oh, my God. Here's his Texas flag, Tammi. No. No. No! [Door opens, closes] ♪ ♪ What's wrong? Nothing. Richard. Richard! [Gasps] [Door opens] You're up, Bear? We got your back. Gotcha. [Door opens] [Door closes] Joe, how you doing? Good to go, sir. Remember Captain Pearson? Wanted to talk to you about how things went down in Nigeria. Talk us through your decision-making up to Buckley's death. Yes, sir. ISR identified a group of vehicles heading toward the target compound. Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One. Roger that. I see them. I tracked them on the Rover. When we lost them in the trees, I made the call to move to site immediately and continue the rescue. The hostages could've been in danger. One of the hostages could've been at risk. While approaching the target, we encountered resistance from an organized force. We engaged, and at this point, Buckley was wounded. Could you have aborted the mission earlier when you were notified of unidentified vehicles on target? Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One. Do you still have them? Negative. We lost them when they reached the target area. Could be nothing. Or it could be a kill team coming in to take out the hostages. Fishbait : We'd be going in blind. It's clear you didn't have tactical advantage. Going in... now. Were you being too aggressive? Foxtrot Delta One. We have troops in contact. Were you being too aggressive? No, sir. No such thing. No such thing? This command relies on you exercising restraint when appropriate. Can you do that? Yes, sir. Man : Hey, look at me, pretty eyes. I made that call. How bad? He's urgent surgical. We had good intel that Rip and the hostages were in there. And you still think it was the right call to make? [Helicopter blades whirring] Yes, sir, I do. Daddy! Dad! Hey. Hey, hey! Oh, missed you guys. I told them about Buck. Are you okay, Dad? Sure. I'm fine. I don't want it to be you, Dad. It's never gonna be me. I'm bulletproof, buddy, remember? [Sighs] Why don't you guys go to the Dairy Queen and get yourself a treat, okay? Come on, RJ. [Grunting] Oh, Papi. Oh, yeah. Sí. What's the matter? ♪♪ What was he like... Buckley? Was an asshole who believed in aliens. Hmm. You don't? [Chuckles] What did I tell you about unpacking? It's okay to open up about what happened, you know. Shouldn't your mother be home soon? You know... my best friend, Trevor, committed suicide a year ago. Did it with a shotgun, so it was a closed casket. I didn't get to see his face, but... I needed to, you know? I made a video for him with pictures and music. I could do the same thing for your friend, maybe show it at the funeral or something? Maybe. I'm gonna need some pictures. You don't have very many. How you doing? I'm fine. The wives are coming over soon to prep for tomorrow. We could use a little help. I packed up most of his stuff from his cage. So much crap in here. Wonder why he kept it. You want me to take it to Tammi's? I'm supposed to take care of my men. I'm supposed to be the ...damn good shepherd. It's not your fault. You don't know that. It's not your fault, Joe. You don't know that! Buck wore this trident on his uniform. All SEALs do. For me, this trident... stands for what we're willing to pay, all of us... for each other. And today Buck picked up that tab. I... Vaya con Dios, amigo. [Speaking Arabic] _ I'll miss you, brother. Till Valhalla. Patch-wearers only. Got the rest of Buck's will here, and I'm, uh, gonna read it to you, and you can decide what you want to do about it. "I, Beauregard Jefferson Davis Buckley, being of sound mind and... superlative body, in the event of getting killed, likely in heroic fashion..." [Laughter] "...task my SEAL brothers with one final mission. They must shoot my bodily remains from a cannon at Malvern Hill Civil War battlefield." [Laughs] Freakin' Buckley. "And make sure my daddy comes, too, that son of a bitch." Well, hell, we're gonna need a map. And a cannon and, uh, tactical gear and NVGs. They have a cannon. They shoot one off every year. Yeah, right. Let's do it. Well, boys, you heard the man. All right, fellas. Any news on Rip and the girls? When there is, you'll be the first to know, Joe. And, uh, Captain Pearson, what did he say about me? The best thing that you can do right now is be there for your team, Joe. Yes, sir. [Television playing indistinctly] Look at this. Man :  Sources have confirmed this was indeed a failed U.S. Special Operations rescue of several Americans, including former Navy SEAL Richard Taggart, as well as the kidnapped schoolgirls... You shouldn't have brought them here. This is our training facility. Sources indicate scores were killed in the raid, including a U.S. Special Operations soldier. See, Akmal. Everything we've been working for. And it's only the beginning. [Sniffs] How's recruiting coming? You were right about the Oregon girl. Marissa. She's online. Keeps asking when she can talk to you again. Bring her up. There's my girl. How are you, Marissa? I can't see you. I want to see you. Not yet. Hey, that jersey looks great. You like it? Kashif tells me you're ready for some more responsibility. Are you studying the Hadith? Mashallah. I want to make you happy. Tell me about your day. Dude, where are the Jell-O shots when you need them? I don't know. Dharma : Hey, Alex. Did you bring a date to this? I mean, that is a new low... even for you. She looks like she's in high school. She is. So, there might be some more photos for the video? Bear, you remember Dharma. Mm! Dharma. Right. Yeah, I-I don't think I've seen you since, uh... Birth? I'm kidding. I'm really sorry about your friend. Yeah. Yeah, we're... We're firing him out of a cannon. Out of a cannon. That is dope! Yeah. Can I come? No way. No. No. She looks just like Alex, don't you think? Photos? Oh, yeah. Uh, the box of Buckley's stuff? Right this way. Thank you, Lena. Mm-hmm. [Cellphone clicks] Testing. I love you, Tammi. I do. I just... I don't know if I can trust you. Awkward. I just can't decide. Could you... Could you come and help? I'm sorry. Just... I can't be alone right now. What'd you find? Nothing. I'm... I think I have all the photos I need. Cool. We're starting up the grill. One thing I didn't know about Buckley was that he had this special affinity for something called NASCAR. [Chuckles] And, uh, that his hair was always perfect. What I do know is that he is my brother. Sir, ma'am... I am truly sorry for your loss. Thank you, son. Uh, Tammi. [Voice breaking] I don't know what to say. Honestly... I was always glad that I wasn't standing up here. But now I am. Dharma, let's play that video now. Right. 
 
 ♪ Oh, Lord, it's hard to be humble ♪ It's all about the hair. ♪ When you're perfect in every way ♪ 
♪ I can't wait to look in the mirror ♪ There we go. ♪ 'Cause I get better-lookin' each day ♪ 
♪ To know me is to love me ♪ 
♪ I must be one hell of a man ♪ 
♪ Oh, Lord, it's hard to be humble ♪ 
♪ But I'm doing the best that I can ♪ [Applause] To Buck! Buck. To Buck! Buck. [Sniffs] He's ready. What I want to know is how's a man who is in the best special-ops team in the world end up as a burned-out security guard in ass-nowhere Nigeria. Who are you? You don't recognize me? Should I? You famous on YouTube for sucking a camel's dick? [Chuckles] You know, comedians are dark, man. Inside, most of them are crying their eyes out. Those girls you kidnapped, they need water, they need food, and they need clean clothes. You think I kidnapped them. I think I saved them. It's all semantics, isn't it? But they're taken care of. We're not Boko Haram. We never really got around to introducing each other. I'm Michael. That's Akmal, ex-Spetsnaz, and straight-up OG. So that's us. Why don't you tell us something about you? No? You know, I remember you being this giant... helmet, goggles... this mythical monster. You get an idea about something in your head, thinking about it over and over, building it up, and then, well... now look at you. Got to say, it's... a disappointment. You got me mixed up with someone else. Oh? Okay. How about we play famous last words? I'll start. "What an artist dies in me." Anything? Anybody? The emperor Nero. How about this one? "He's just a raghead driver, doesn't speak any English." Anything? No. My brother... Omar. He was a good kid. From Detroit, remember? He loved the Lakers because of Kobe. That's what he told you... an unarmed kid who'd surrendered right before you murdered him. What did you do with the body? Did you even have the decency to bury him, or did you just throw him in the trash? I remember now. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't kill all of you M*therf*ckers. So you do whatever it is you got to do. Just spare me the moral justification. Good talk. We'll finish it later. [Door opens, closes] It was a one-in-a-million shot, Bear, an act of God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was an act of God. Hey. [Chuckles] The enemy gets a vote, too. Sometimes, it goes against us. Come on. We've got a mission to do. [Laughter] Here it is here. There's the field. The cannon is near the hills. Big boom. So why Malvern Hill? His great-great-granddaddy died there. Right. The, uh... The general. Yeah, he told me about it. That's right. Cullen? Yeah. He was a buck private. Private! He was a private. Oh! 19 years old. [Laughter] Having fun, boys? Yep. Gentlemen, I have something for you. It's my husband, good old Buck. Well, some of him, anyway. Fresh baked. Straight from the oven. We'll take care of him, Tammi. I promise. Like you did out there? Huh, Joe? Hey. Come on, let's get some fresh air. Don't touch me. I have every right to be shit-faced, same as all of you. Hey. This lady can do whatever she wants. Hey, this isn't any of your business, man. This makes it my business. A Glock? Really? Hey, Buddha, how many people did you kill the other day? Ortiz : Two. Fish, how about you? One. It was from 200 yards out. Hell of a shot. Me, I killed three for, what, Chase, 20 bucks an hour? Well, given the travel time, we're looking at $18. See, we don't do it for the money. Neither did our buddy. See, he didn't die for money or you or whatever it is you wannabe GI Joes do for a living or the flag or the stock market. He died for us, and we'd die for him. We'd kill for him, too. Don't worry about the beers. I got 'em. Graves : Light discipline, assholes. Tactical! Going tactical! ♪ ♪ Somebody responsible! Let's blow it! Yeah, yeah. But how? I got a video. Okay, give it to Bear. Here, press play. Number one man, Caulder, clears the barrel. Got it. The barrel... clear! Number two man, Chase. Yep. Add the gunpowder. Roger that. Little Fishy. Yeah? Number three man adds the pin. Set! Okay, number four man, Ortiz, add the shell. What? Add the shell. You got the shell. What shell? Nobody told me to bring nada. Where's the shell, Buddha? Hey, nobody... nobody told me I had to bring a shell. You got to be me, Buddha. Hey, hey. Aw, that's... Nah, that's not gonna work. Bag of Buck. Right here. Bag of Buck. Here we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice and gentle. Nice and gentle. To Buck. And every brother who never came home. To Buck! Buck! To Rip. Who's still out there. To Rip! To Rip! To Rip! Rip. Brothers. ♪ ♪ Maybe it was this... sh1t! [Laughter] ♪ ♪ [Man chanting in Arabic] [Door opens] Mr. Rip! Ah! Is everybody okay? Yes. Huh? You okay? Yes. We have beds and food. We have books, too. They've been nice. They asked me to keep teaching the girls. Girls, would you... Would you finish your coloring? Who are these people? Do you know? No. Mr. Rip. Look. It is all of us. There's you, teacher Na'omi. You think this looks like me? Of course it looks like you! Why wouldn't it? [Speaking indistinctly] I like it. [Laughter] 10-4! Play nice! [Indistinct shouting, laughter] My son would've loved this. Yes, he would. I've been running it over and over in my head if there was anything that I could've done to have saved him. I was in the 101st. Vietnam. Yeah. I lost seven men. That was 50 years ago. Not a day goes by I don't think about 'em. These decisions... most men never have to face. But if you do make them, you've got to make peace with them. Right here, right now. 'Cause if you hold on to 'em like... like I did, they're just gonna tear you apart... tear apart your family. [Door closes] After you do this, you let those girls go. That's all I ask. Do what? Oh, you think I'm gonna cut your head off and post it online? [Chuckles] Come on, dude. That's so cliché. I just need you to read this for the camera. Look it over and let me know when you're ready. I took a lot of time with that. You know, most of these things, you can tell they're coerced... you know, bad grammar, no sense of style or flow. They're just checking off boxes on the terrorist checklist. You know what's missing? Sincerity. Why'd you let your brother take that bullet? How does it feel knowing you stood by doing absolutely nothing? I will never forgive myself. Ever. Good. But I might forgive you. Just pick up the paper. You pick it up. Tell me, what do you call innocents that get caught up in our conflict... you know, women, children, civilians? Collateral damage, right? That's above my pay grade. Right. Collateral. I looked it up in the OED... parallel, side by side, related but different. The families on a boardwalk in Nice, the guests at a wedding in Afghanistan... a bomb strapped to a chest, a drone controlled from Nevada... Boom! Both dead and gone thanks to us. Is that a fancy way of saying that I'm like you? Well, I'm not. So you take your OED, and you shove it up your terrorist... [Cellphone beeps] Hey, Akmal. Show him. Hi, Esther. Say hello to Mr. Rip. Hi, Mr. Rip. Na'omi can't say hello. We had to gag her. Na'omi, you can nod. Akmal, show us what Esther and Na'omi are wearing. It's a bit dramatic, but that's the idea. Akmal has the detonator to these. You ready, Akmal? Akmal : Just give me the word. Hey! Hey. You want to treat me like the faceless bad guy without a conscience, ISIS, Bin Laden's bogeyman, go ahead. But I'm just a Muslim kid from Michigan who found out that the American dream was a lie for someone like me. America made us both. You know, actually, you could say we made each other. I never thought we'd have this opportunity, but here we are. And you were right. It is about us. I don't want them to be a part of it. I really don't. But sometimes, there's collateral damage. Right, Rip? Make me believe it. When you call up your witness, you want to swear them in first, like this. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I do. Be seated. Would the attorneys like to give their opening statements? Who's on trial? [Light laughter] Counselors, we'll take a five-minute recess. In the courtroom! Oh, hey, kids. [Both laugh] I'm sorry about the other night. Joseph Graves, we will talk about this when we get home. This is yours. Thank you. Good morning. They're late for school. Way late. Hey, Dad. Anabel! Hey, I'll take 'em. I'll take 'em. Mom's taking us. Anabel, you have two seconds. Say hello to your father. Hello to my father. Aww! Mwah! Okay, time's up. Let's go. Okay. Dad? Yes, darling. You smell really bad. I love you guys. [Door closes] Graves. Captain Pearson had a few questions about how things were handled. He recommended that you take a few weeks off, but I said no. Thank you, sir. Can I trust you to keep it together? Look me in the eye and tell me I can trust you. You can trust me. Good. Your team supports you, and so do I. Thank you, sir. [Claps] Yo! Swell's coming in. I got an extra board. Dharma? Dharma. Dharma, you can't sleep through the day. [Tablet beeps] Tammi :  I'm sorry. Just... I can't be alone right now. Hold me. Caulder :  Tammi, I can't... Please. ♪ ♪ Man : I can't believe this sh1t. [Television playing indistinctly] Man :  Why don't we go ahead and show the video. Rip :  My name is Richard Taggart, and I'm the face of America. Everything that I'm about to tell you comes from my heart. For 17 years, I was a soldier on SEAL Team Six, the most elite special-operations team in the world. On September 3rd, in Kunar, Afghanistan, 2014, I murdered an unarmed American who had surrender peacefully. I... I know now... Excuse me, this is very hard for me to admit... that I was nothing more than a hired assassin who committed war crimes. To the rest of the world, rise up and fight America's endless war against innocent Muslims. To America, take back your own soul, your dream of justice and freedom. To my brothers on SEAL Team Six... look inside your hearts. Let your better nature, let the truth... let it shine through. It's not too late. I am proof of that.
