♪ The omens, they never lie ♪ [Helicopter blades whirring] [Indistinct conversation] Woman :  I told Bob... you know, the youth minister... I told him to have the kids choir sing in the fellowship hall. We sold 150 cupcakes in an hour. What was the sermon about? "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends." John 15:13. Right. Those names we were talking about? Yeah? Well, meet Sarah. [Chuckles] [Laughs] Hey. Good job, Bear. Really happy for you, Bear. I'd give mine back if I could. You don't mean that. Children... It's what it's all about. No, I mean it. Wait, how long have you been over here? You sure she's yours? Very funny, Caulder. I-I-I got to go. I love you. I love you, too. We're naming her Sarah. Wait, from the Bible? Abraham's wife? Here it comes. Abraham was a player, dude. Dude had like five wives. My man Abe was all about hitting it. You're going to Hell. You know that, right? Yeah, I did know a Sarah from Coronado once. Best pole dancer I ever saw. Sarah's a fine name. Sarita. Sounds good in Spanish, too. Yes, man. You'll like being a father, Bear. Gives you ballast. Keeps you upright through the storm. Thank you, Buddha.

Looks like Muttaqi struck again. 43 casualties. We picked up SIGINT at a village up in Kunar. Full Taliban. He's surrounded by civilians, so drones and air strikes are out. We're working up a CONOPS. Command wants us to take a shot tonight. You know how many times we've rolled snake eyes with this guy? So, what do you think? You know what I think. All right, let's do this. Right, Amigo? Yeah. Why not? It's a nice night for a walk. Caulder? Yeah, sure. Okay. Hey, Rip. Bear's got news. It's a girl. Wow. [Chuckles] We're having a little girl. That's great news. Good for you, Bear. Good for you. Yeah. And we want you to be the godfather. I'm... I'm honored, but you know me. How can you say no? I don't... I don't... I don't know. I don't know... [Laughter] Let me see her one more time. Okay, yeah. I'm in. [Laughter] Congratulations. Thanks, brother. [Applause] [Indistinct conversations] Let's go get this asshole. Let's go to work.

No, no, he's just... He's just a rag-head driver. He doesn't even speak English. Where's Muttaqi? I don't know, man. They don't tell me anything. I swear to God. He was supposed to be here. Maybe... Maybe he heard you guys coming. You the one who killed those kids? No! No! It was Abdul! It was... It was something personal. You know how these hajis are, man. Please. My f'ing leg, man. Where's your medic? Why'd you run, then? I was scared. Your guys went all Geronimo in there. You saw what he did. Please, I... I-I want to go home. Please. [Gunshot] No... What the f*ck? He was a threat. He surrendered. He was an American. He's not a goddamn American. He was working for Muttaqi. Let's put this one on the bird. It's not gonna make a difference, Amigo. He'll be out in two weeks. Let's put this one on the bird. [Helicopter blades whirring in distance] This is so... up. You saw that, Bear. Rip was right. He was a threat. End of story, Caulder. Let's go. [Helicopter approaches] ♪ ♪ So, Buddha, this thing for Anabel... we got to dress up or what? Just don't wear your Jesus sandals, if that's what you're asking me. Hey, they're Birkies. But, hey, it's your party. 15, Buddha. Thank you. You believe Anabel is 15? Yeah. What are you even doing out here? You should be selling yerba mate at a beach somewhere. Your daughter's 17, in case you don't remember, bro. She is? I had her when I was 12, so what does that make you... 50? [Chuckles] We're all getting old, amigo. Ah, not me, man. I'm-a live hard, die young, leave a beautiful corpse. I can see two of three coming true. [Laughter] Who are you? That's Chase. Take the empty cage. Hey. Are you sure about that, Bear? It didn't end so good for the last guy. Or the one before. Something about a Claymore. And a dolphin. So, this is the new-guy scene where you give me sh1t, right? Hey, Chase, why don't you go and draw us some beers from the team room? Mugs are on the wall. Yeah. You do know our names, don't you? Part of the job, kid. Hey, new guy. Yeah? Other door.

 You look like sh1t. How we saving the world today? P.R. Do-gooder oil company breaks ground for a new girls' school. Put these plates in. I'm good. You're not a SEAL anymore, Taggart, so you follow orders. And orders say we're supposed to look like we know what we're doing. Put them in. What's the comm plan? The comm plan is, you charge your cellphone. [Scoffs] Ugh. Lose that. Jesus. Act professional. And here... have an Altoid. Take the whole can. When I was in the 1st of the 9th, we never put up with shitbirds like you. Yeah, I heard you guys really squared away. [Engine starts] Man : Open the gate! [Girls singing in native language] Na'omi : That was beautiful, girls. Thank you. Girls : Thank you, Teacher Na'omi. Let us begin with our daily reading. Esther, have you prepared? Yes, Teacher Na'omi. Excellent. We can't wait to hear. Please. "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom. It was the age of foolishness. It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of light." Priest : Loving God, we thank you for Anabel, who today celebrates her 15th birthday. May she grow in wisdom, knowledge, and grace. May she love her family and be faithful to her friends. Anabel, you wear these today to remind us all that you are a woman now. [Chuckles] But, to me, you are still my little girl. You will always be my baby. [Chuckles] Hold it together, Daddy. You can do it. [Inhales sharply] [Chuckles] Fiesta! [Cheers and applause] ♪ Today is gonna be a lovely day ♪ She's so beautiful. You guys should try again. I don't think Joe's ready. They never know what to do. You have to tell them. [Scoffs] Like Buck would listen. I've been telling Ricky for years that he had to get out. It finally sunk in. What finally sunk in? The job at GSS. You know. The interview's set up? Ricky didn't tell them? [Applause] Joe is gonna take that hard. Excuse me. [Dance music playing] [Indistinct conversations] [Music continues] Jack, congratulations. Feel 'em up. Yeah, Anabel turned out pretty good considering. Well, I'm just gonna say this, okay? I'm getting out. What are you talking about? Anabel... she got accepted at that dance school, and I can't float the tuition on my E-8 paycheck. Besides, I'm sick of you guys. It's mutual. You can't just quit on us. It's time, Bear. I'll make sure the new guy's ready to roll. But that's it. I'm gone. So... Hey, Buckley, let's get this party started. [Vehicle door opens] What is going on here? Nick : The groundbreaking for your new school. SymcoPetro wants to give back, not just with job-creating economic investments, but here, with the future. I was very clear when I accepted your offer, and I am grateful. Thank you. But there was to be no publicity. It is dangerous for you to be here. Can't you see the graffiti? It'll only take a few minutes. We'll be done. And one of my colleagues is here to discuss some security arrangements with you so you'll feel safer. Uh, Miss, if, uh, you give us a look around, we can suggest some precautions... I don't want you mercenaries anywhere near my students. Nick, can we get some more girls in the shot? Yeah, I'll get them. No. You all have to leave. Now. He's just trying to give your school some money. Don't be a problem. You  are the problem here, not the solution. You steal our oil and exploit our people and tell us it's for our own good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, you know what? You're giving me a goddamn headache. You are hung over. I should never have taken your bloody money. Why don't you look at me when I talk to you? Are you even listening to me? I won't be silenced. Not even by you. Get the girls inside. What? What? Take the girls inside. Now! [Machine-gun fire, girls screaming] Girls, run! [Indistinct shouting] [Gunfire continues] [Screaming] [Grunts] [Screaming] Stand by. Stand by. Ready. Ready. 3... 2... 1... execute. One minute till the next breach. You're a college boy. You know that to every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction, right? Yes. Newton's Third Law of Motion. That was way too much reaction. You're using an ax where you should be using a scalpel. Let's do another one. The new guy's not gonna cut it. A dozen oyster shooters says you're wrong. Stop. It's not all about the power. It's also about the placement. You have to think about the breaching problem. Read the door. Come on. Read the door, Chase. Well, how about you tell me exactly what I did wrong, Ortiz, and I'll fix it. You figure it out, smart guy. Smart, dead guy. Laying it on him kind of thick, don't you think, Buddha? The kid's good, way better than you. Of course, it wouldn't take much. [Sighs] Still got some habits from his old team. I have two more weeks. I'll have him ready to go. You're really going through with this. Yeah. Got some papers to sign, bro. So, sign them and get the hell out of here. [Scoffs] Yeah, whatever you say, boss. That was good, Bear, real motivational. You want Buddha to change his mind and stay, you might want to show the guy a little love. Got it. Buy him a beer, dude, take him out for dinner. The last hour, we've seen several apparently coordinated attacks... on a movie theater in Istanbul, on an Army training facility in Jakarta, and our embassy in Tanzania... small teams using state-of-the-art gear and highly organized command and control. These were like Paris 2.0. Could be an ISIS affiliate. Could be A.Q. Could be independent. Bottom line... these guys appear to be well-trained, with a degree of coordination we haven't seen before. All right, there's one more thing, apparently unrelated. 24 hours ago, armed men assaulted a girls' school 80 miles northwest of Benin City, Nigeria. Hostages were taken... a teacher, a couple dozen school girls. They killed an American security contractor and a videographer and posted some of his photos on their website. I got some bad news. They also captured Richard Taggart, former troop chief of this command, who apparently was working for the same private contractor. As of now, Rip has not been I.D.'d as a former member of SEAL Team Six. And I don't have to say how much personal danger that would put him in or how much of a security risk knowing what he knows he would be. Sir, who has him? Boko Haram. Right, Lieutenant? Kidnapping schoolchildren is one of their M.O.s. Boko Haram is Africa's largest terrorist organization. They don't mess around. They killed more people last year than ISIS did. We're tracking an HVT, a courier with intimate knowledge of Boko Haram's operations. He may know where Rip is. SIGINT has him headed to a meeting in Lagos Harbour. All right, White Squadron, we're on the hook for this. Sir, my team wants that mission. I already tasked you with it. You guys are on a short leash while we develop the target package. One hour recall till further notice. I didn't know Rip was in Africa, did you? Had no idea. Must be making a killing on his contracts. Hey, we should talk about this later. Hey, Bear, did you know he was in Africa? Let him go, Bear. This is on you. [Grunts] He was there because of you. Hey, Joe. Joe, let him go. Joe! Joe! [Gasping] [Breathing heavily] It's not his fault. It's not anybody's fault. It just is. Now, we're gonna fix this because that's what we do. We're gonna bring Rip back home. Hmm? You okay? Mm-hmm. What the hell was that about, Ortiz? We don't get to know, do we, Buddha? Know what? What really happened in Afghanistan, why Rip got out so fast. Rip got out because he had personal problems. His wife left him and cleaned out his bank account. There you go. Happy now? Joseph. Honey? Hey. [Hose shuts off] [Sighs] I'm gonna go inside and clean up. We'll eat in half an hour. All right. Dear God, bless this food to our use and us to Thy service. In Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You want to know what I was praying for? The bathroom door's sticking. I can re-hang it. Forget about fixing the house, Joe. It's been a year since Sarah died. Remember how many kids you told me you wanted? Four. And now we just want one. I need a baby. And so do you. And with how long it took before... I'm making an appointment with a specialist. Those doctors... we can't afford it. It's not about the money. It will be! It will be. Look, after dinner, go out to your workshop. Get out the plans for the crib you built Sarah. It's time to build a new one. Hey. It's Ricky. Any updates? Yeah, man, I'm sitting tight. That's all I'm doing. Okay. [Sighs] Go on in. Hey. Ricky. Why are you here? Hmm? Here, baby. Put this in your room. Okay. You said you wanted to be a part of things, right? Yeah. So? Anabel? Her dance class? Oh, oh. You said you'd pick her up! Yeah. [Speaking Spanish] Move, move, move. Let's go. Yeah. Let's go. You're gonna be late. No, I got it, got it, got it. Oh, man. [Indistinct conversations] [Up-tempo piano music playing] [Music stops] [Clears throat] [Indistinct conversations] Wow. That was amazing. You've gotten so good. You didn't even see me. Where's Mom? Uh, I-I thought I'd pick you up. Do you want to get some ice cream? I'm lactose intolerant. I have been for, like, forever. You're what? Come on, Daddy. Let's get sorbet. Yeah. Lena said you were out here. [Door closes] What are you building? Separation gift for Buddha. That's funny. Lena said you were making a new crib. What's on your mind? I'm just as mad about Rip as you are, so I'm not gonna take your sh1t personal. You should. Rip crossed the line. He lost his self-control. The only line that I care about is between good and evil, and Rip was on the side of good. You've seen everything we've seen, and you still think it's that simple? You betrayed your troop chief. You might as well have gut-shot him. I didn't tell Rip anything he didn't know himself. That's why he left. You lose it like he did, I'll do the same thing to you. Well, that's where you and I are different. That's one way. If Rip's alive, we'll get him. We got to work together, so we will. You got my back, I got yours. But... you come at me like that again, you better finish the job. [Door opens] Woman : Get off of me! [Groaning] No! Hey! Hey! Hey!! [Gasps] [Whimpers] [Speaking native language] [Speaking native language] What did he say to you? He's saving me for his boss. [Metal clanging] Get up! [Indistinct shouting] [Girls crying] [Girls screaming] No! Where are you taking them? Miss Na'omi! Wait! Where are you taking them? Pray. Be strong and pray. Pray. [Shouting continues] It won't close, okay? Okay. Let me see. Uh, leave it unbuttoned. The tie should cover it up. Too much Taco Bell. You won't laugh when I pawn your phone to pay your tuition. [Both chuckle, doorbell rings] Boy : I'll get it! Remember to ask about the tuition plan... does it cover Anabel and Ricky Jr.? You only told me, what, five times? [Sighs] At least six. Hey. Is this, uh... Is this a bad time? Is it, Ricky? Is it a bad time? It'll... It'll just take a... a minute. A minute. So, the... the necklace I got for Anabel... she like it? Yeah. Won't take it off. Picked her up at ballet today. Look, I got ask... you sign your separation papers yet? I was about to. We can't get Rip if you're not there. The new guy is not ready, okay? And I don't know if I can handle Caulder's bullshit without you. [Chuckles] Yeah? Bear... I don't have a choice, man. Anabel's school deposit is due next month. I have to take this job. I know this is a tough call for you, all right? One more time. That's all I'm asking. ♪ ♪ [Breathing heavily] [Cellphone ringing] Oh, man. [Tires screech] [Engine shuts off] Hey! Congratulations. You owe me more money. If you don't get current on your payments, it's called contempt of court. Dharma, this man's your father, in case you don't recognize him. I know it's been a while. Why didn't you wait for me? We'll just add it to everything else in her life that you missed. By the way, your lawyer quit. [Cellphone vibrating] Dharma, that's his dog whistle. It's time for your father to disappear. I'll take care of this! Sure you will, Alex. Global Structure Security is an international firm based in 52 countries. Uh, we run an elite service for our private security clients. As you know, our team is based in SEAL principles, but of course not with SEAL salaries. Now, you'll be very pleased with your take-home pay. Your clearance up to date? Yeah, of course. About the benefit package... I hear you have, uh, a tuition assistance plan? Correct... for approved educational institutions. Now, if you don't have any other questions for me, I have one for you. When can you start? [Grunts, pants] Goddamned media outing Rip like that. Who the hell told them? They were bound to find out. It doesn't change anything for us. It means we need to get our asses in gear, or pieces of Rip are gonna be hanging from a bridge somewhere. Chase, you got everything? Yeah. You got the initiators? Four kinds. What about the non-el? Hey, cut the kid some slack. It's not his first day of kindergarten. We got to go wheels up. Give the guys the word. Let it go, Bear. We're all on our own path. Buddha's path is just out of here. [Indistinct shouting] It's just till we get Rip back. I owe him, okay? You owe  us.  This school... Anabel's been dreaming about it since she was 6. I know. I know. It will all work out somehow. How? You gonna sell Ricky Jr.? You spent our savings on the quinceañera. And don't even say that you're gonna sell the house, because our mortgage is underwater. All right,  calmate, bonita. I will take care of it when I get back. That's what I do. That's what you're supposed to do... take care of us. But you're not even doing that. Tell the kids I'll be back in a week, maybe less. You tell them. Hey... I love you. Come home to me, Ricky. I always do. [Vehicle door closes] ♪ ♪ You're late. We gonna do this, or are we just gonna talk about it? Who's that? I want to go home, please.
