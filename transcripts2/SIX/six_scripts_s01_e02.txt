 Previously on "Six"... 
 The United States has been fighting a war against terror for 15 years. [Screams] [Gunfire] SEAL Team Six and other Special Operations forces have been deployed for 5,400 days. It is the longest war in American history. Knock it out! Terror attacks all over the world are at an all-time high. Muttaqi did this. He's hiding in a village in Kunar. Command wants us to take a shot tonight. Check this out. Goddamn savages. Wait! Wait! I'm American! I want to go home. No! [Silenced gunshot] He surrendered. He was an American. He was a threat. Been almost a year. We have to move on. If you don't get current on your payments, it's called contempt of court. This man's your father, in case you don't recognize him. I'm getting out. Can't just quit on us. I'll make sure the new guy's ready to roll. You do know our names, don't you? This is the new guy scene, where you guys give me sh1t, right? Take the girls inside... Now! [People screaming] 24 hours ago, armed men assaulted a girls school 80 miles northwest of Benin City, Nigeria. Hostages were taken. They also captured Richard Taggart, former troop chief at this command. Let him go, Bear. He's there because of you. Hey. We're gonna fix this, because that's what we do. It's just till we get Rip back. Come home to me, Ricky. I always do. Who's that? [Silenced gunshot] That's the man who killed my brother. [Tires screech] [Indistinct conversations] Hey, Delta Echo, bring it in. HVT is Ebo Buhari. Been running as a courier for Boko Haram and ISIL these past few months. He knows where Rip is. He's been operating out of a cargo ship in Lagos Harbor. He will have guards, and they will be armed. All right, ISR shows a periodic stationary sentry here, an irregular roving patrol here, so we board at the portside stern. Hook and climb two ladders, own a footprint, secure the deck. Point man. Fishbait. Your element secures the high ground and sets up an overwatch. I will take my element down one deck to this area over here, start knocking on doors, and hope that our guy's home. Breacher. Based on the sister ship study, we focus on the cabin doors, take a standard load-out for VBSS. We want to get through something, we'll get through it. Why is he talking? Chase is the lead breacher on this op. I'm just assist. No, he can learn on another op. You take it. Okay. What he said. [Clears throat] Once we have the HVT and the target is secure, we commence SSE. Bag everything for intel. New guy, that's your job. We have two minutes to get what we need. After that, Delta and Echo units link up here at the hook point. Then we call the extract birds. If everything goes as planned... Which, as we know, it always does. Now they know who Rip is, there's no telling what they might do, so it's up to us to get there before they do it. This guy gets us there. We get in, we get out, we ask for forgiveness later. We cannot and will not dick this up. [Breathing shakily] [Whimpering, crying] Special soldier! More of you come? Come for you? [Gun cocks] [Speaking native language] Recruiter  : Michael? Some assistance. Talk to me. Marissa Wyatt, Oregon, 17 years old, three months in development. Her grandmother's telling her to cut contact. Where are you in the script? The script isn't working. Well, you make it work. Give me a lead. She likes soccer, but she can't play. She's asthmatic. She wants to be part of a team. That's in the script. So? What do you sell? Camaraderie, purpose, opportunity for leadership. Family, dude. Always bring it back to family. What else? We set up her own Twitter account, make her feel important. [Knocks] We're ready. Muttaqi's on the game. [Chuckling] Look at all these selfies. Tell you what... send her an Alex Morgan jersey, a Nikon DSLR. And don't worry about Grandma. She's not gonna be an issue. [Beep] You've seen the news? Muttaqi: Of course. Everyone here is very pleased with the embassy. Are you prepared for the next phase? I'm talking about the American soldier... The one Boko Haram picked up. I want him. This will be bigger than that. [Beep] What did he say? He says we're on. Nick  : What's gonna happen to us? Somebody answer me. You're the security guy. You can do something, right? He's a drunk. He is no help to us. Tell it to us straight. What are we dealing with here? You don't want to know. Hakeem  : We will be dead in a week. Jesus Christ. The women and girls... They will wish they had never lived at all. Those men outside... They saw you on TV. They said you had special skills. You were right the first time. I can't help you. Okay, let's, uh... let's think about this. If he's on TV, then so are we. They're probably negotiating our release right now. They have a price they're asking, right? So my company will pay it. We just have to wait until they do. Who is going to pay for them? They'll pay for all of us. That's bullshit. They're on their own, and you know it. Is this true? No. It's not true. I need you to be more positive. I don't work for you anymore, so what you need isn't my problem. I'm not going to let anything else happen to my girls. And if any of you have a speck of humanity in your hearts, neither will you. Lady, heart ain't got anything to do with it. [Grunts] [Sighs] [Sighs] Graves  : That's it. What do you say, Team Leader? Let's take it down. Graves  : Delta 1 making entry. On the clock. [Man speaking native language in distance] [Door closes] [Indistinct conversations, laughter] [Silenced gunshots] Don't shoot! Don't shoot! It's him. Great. Let's pack it up and go. All stations, this is Delta 1. Jackpot. I say again... jackpot. Hey. Where's this man? It's been two minutes, Bear. Now let's get off the X. I'm gonna ask you again... Where's this man?! Let it go. They'll debrief him later. By the grace of Allah, in the ground. [Grunts] [Water running] [Water stops] [Grunting] Where is he? Where is he? I don't know! Bullshit! You know! [Screaming] Let's go! Where is he?! Bear, let's roll! [Screaming continues] I'm in! Grenade! Jesus! What the hell? Chase  : Are you hit? No, no. I'm good. I'm good! [Gunfire] Buhari  : Help! Help!! Shut up! Caulder, get us out of here. Oh, so now you're in a hurry. This way! Fishbait  :  That you guys? Roger that. We're engaging multiple targets. We're moving out. They heard the blast. Get up here... now! Working on it. On me! [Indistinct shouting in distance] Any stations on this net, this is Delta 1. Radio check. Foxtrot 2-2 copies. Be advised, helos are two minutes out. [Door handle rattles] What the hell, Caulder? It's cool. We go through it. Breacher. Got it. Going explosive. In here? Yeah. No. Chase, roll out. We're cutting through. Get the hoolie ready. [Shouting continues] Delta 1, Foxtrot 2-2, helos are on station. Anytime. You're up. [Gunfire] Move him! Move! Let's go, Chase. [Metal groaning] Ready? [Both grunting] Come on! Open! On me! We're at the portside aft ladders. Going external on the main deck. Move! Delta 1, Delta 4, we have your position. We have your egress covered. All right, come on, come on, come on. They're on the dock! One. Last man! Two. Three. Four. [Helicopter blades whirring] Five. Six. [Panting] Graves  : It was a judgment call. Yeah, a bad one. The risk-reward ratio was way off. The reward was on the ship. The guy might've told us where Rip was. By now, he's had a chance to clam up. Maybe yes, maybe no, but there's a right and a wrong way to do things. And you decide what's right and what's wrong? It's what you do? What I don't do is drag out a B.I., getting us into a gunfight that could have been avoided. Do you want to save Rip or don't you? All right, you can ask that once. But what I'm wondering... And, Buddha, you can let me know if I'm way off here... Is, maybe you want to save Rip too much. I asked that man to be the godfather to my daughter. Do you remember that? 'Cause you were there, and so were you. Okay, Bear... You better believe that it is personal. It is about as personal as it gets. You know... it must be great... Not feeling anything for anybody. Hey, Bear. Come on. [Door closes] I'm feeling something right now. You're awfully quiet. 'Course, I would be, too, if I had to go face Jackie. This is some deep sh1t for Bear. You know it. I know it is. But he pushed it too hard on that op. We lost the initiative. We got behind the eight-ball. We can't let that happen again. Better not. Hey, just so you know... Mm-hmm? In my family, I am el jefe, okay? Sure you are. [Both laugh] I don't even believe it when I say it. [Both laugh] [Sighs] Monita, I'm home. [Video-game gunfire] Hey, RJ. What's up, buddy? Hey. [Chuckles] [Gunfire continues] Uh, so, uh... did you pass that thing where the, um... Yep. Cool. Is Mom home? Think she went out. [Gunfire stops] It's Career Day at school tomorrow. Everybody's dad's gonna be there. Yeah. We can't talk about what I do. You know that, right? Maybe next year? Yeah, sure. Yeah. [Gunfire resumes] Hey, you know where Mom keeps the Advil? Bathroom, maybe? Good call. [Mid-tempo music plays] Anabel  : Don't be a brat, RJ. It's Papa. I'm home. Come back later. What?! I want to see you. Open up. Come on. Hey. How you doing? Homework. I mean, fine. Give me a hug. Come on. What's up? We weren't doing anything. Dad. I want you to know, Mr. Ortiz, that I respect your daughter as... as a woman. Oh, for Christ's sake. Come back in 10 years. I can't believe you just did that. Where's your mother? Working, okay? God, I hate you! You're ruining everything! No, no, no. Wait, you can't... [Door slams] [Children shouting playfully] How was it? Good. We all got back. You ready? Nice shot. Thank you. Hey, Beermeister. Thought you didn't drink. Yeah, well, you damn frogmen drove me to it. [Laughter] That happens. Skipper says the beer lamp is lit. Thank you. What do we got? A little Jose. Yeah, my middle name. There you go. Yeah, buddy. The fewer, the prouder, the braver. Salud. Mm. You want one, Buck? Nah, I'm good. Whoa, Buck, you don't want a shot? Come on, man. You need to stop doing this sh1t in the bar. [Chuckles] Jerk off in your cave. I think Babydoll might be cheating on me. Hope not. Are you kidding me? You're spying on your wife. Yeah, I am. You have heard of couples therapy, right? Ain't nobody got no time for that. [Chuckles] Hey, Buck, can you send me that link? Dick. [Laughs] No, I'm serious. Send me the link. What actually happened to Senior Chief Taggart? Above my pay grade, bro. 
 
 [Men speaking native language, laughter] [Rip sighs] What are you looking at? I'm counting the guards. There are five guards. Maybe 15 shooters. I heard them talking. They're afraid of you. When their leader comes, they will kill you. Yeah, well, sh1t happens. Do you know what Boko Haram does to girls? They will sell them as slaves, and they'll be raped by their so-called husbands, forced into motherhood before they can even be children themselves. Their own families will shun them. They will be turned away as outcasts, and they won't ever be able to go home again. Look at them. Can you imagine what that... Like I said, sh1t happens. Nothing anybody can do about it. Please. They don't have much, but I can put something together. We can pay you. You work for money, don't you? Mister? It's true what you say, isn't it? They won't pay for us. Bertina... That's my sister... She doesn't know how to feed my bird. If I am not there, who will feed him? Did you put her up to this? No. The seeds are in a tin under my bed. Can you tell her I said that? Esther. Her name is Esther. She's a Christian. Some of the others are Muslim. But neither God nor Allah [Sighs] will save them unless... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Okay. [Sighs] $25,000. Dr. Banerjee : For the first attempt, yes. If payment is a concern, we offer credit with excellent terms. That's IVF. We're gonna start smaller, right? Yes, we typically begin with Clomid to see if we can stimulate ovulation and go from there. And that's... Inexpensive... Maybe $50. Is there anything else that she can try, um, at home? You know, naturally? Well, given her age and past history, it's not surprising that your wife is having trouble conceiving. I'd like to do a physical exam to check for any cervical irregularities and draw blood for labs. We should also get a semen sample. Why? Joseph. The more information we have, the better. All right. Okay. Now? Fine. [Sexy music plays, woman giggles] Woman  : Ohh! [Chuckles] [Heavy breathing, moaning] [Sighs] [Clears throat] [Sighs] [Scoffs] Of course. [Volume increases] [Clatter] [Knock on door] I'm f... I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. Lena  : It's me. Did you already do it? Look, I-I think that we should just, you know, come back another day. Oh, my God. Is that a VCR? Yeah. Uh, no. Don't... [Sighs] Wow. Her boobs are so big. How does she even run? I don't think that's a big priority. Hmm. Mm. [Chuckles softly] The last time we watched an actual p0rn film was in high school. Remember that? On the church trip. Mm-hmm. Mm? Mm! [Zipper opens] [Chuckles] Mm! My big Bear. [Chuckles] [Moans] Lena, I just... What? Do you want me to stop? [Chuckles] Don't you dare. [Both laugh] Shh! You "Shh." [Gasps] Okay. Get the cup. Get the cup! [Laughing] Get the cup! [Both laugh] [Moans] Oh, Jesus Christ! What was that? Two essences melding together in a single fleeting moment. [Giggles] Don't ruin it, hon. I still get my French toast, right?

We got the target we wanted. Now let's see what he says. And the new guy? What's his name? Chase? Oh, he's getting there. Well, he's lucky to have you. You know, we should invite him over for dinner, like Rip did for you. Yeah, we should. Hey, where were you? I was working. You fill in somewhere, like a temp or something? No. Mi amor, uh... listen. The drug company that I used to work for before Anabel? They had a sales opening. If I work nights and weekends, it might be enough. Hey, hey, hey. Nights and weekends? What about the kids? They need you here. If we need the extra help, we can ask my mom. Your mother? Here? Why don't you kill me first? Hey, that contracting job... Once we have Rip, I'll take it, okay? It's all gonna be fine. Ricky. You're living in a dreamland. We need the deposit for Anabel now. If we want this for her, then this is how it's gonna be. You know what your daughter was doing while you were gone? She was in her room with a boy and the door was locked. Can we talk about this later? Give me that. Go brush your teeth. Hey, I think we should really ta... [Groans] What is it, baby? Nada, nada. Is it your knee? No. Let me see it. I'm fine. Let me see it. [Sighs] Whoa! Can you bend it? Yes, of course I can. Feels hot. That's because I ran out of peas. Anabel! Anabel  : What? Get the keys to the van. We're taking your dad to the hospital. Why? What happened? Nothing. I'm fine. Hey, you're overreacting. Can I drive? No. You can't drive. RJ, you stay here. No way! I'm coming, too! We're going to the hospital at Sandhill. Hey, hey! Stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey. I'm fine. I can go to our clinic tomorrow, okay? They'll give me a shot of cortisone or something. Please. Just... Just come and sit and we can spend some time together as a family, okay? [Sighs] Ricky. Get in the van. Shotgun! [Door opens] [Sighs] [Cellphone rings] [Cellphone beeps] Everybody in position? Make it happen. [Cellphone beeps] [Earpiece rings] [Beep] It's taken care of. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. I'm going to get the SEAL. Not without approval. He is a distraction from your mission. This is Boko Haram we're talking about. They're gonna wrap this guy in Goodyears and torch him. With all respect, he's important for our cause. Respect is real when given without hope for reward. Meet me in Qatar in two days. [Click] [Beep] How did you find out where I lived? Court records, Alex. They're public. Did you make this? Yes, I made it. Where is your mother? Like I would know. You could call Brad, but he says you're a war criminal. A what? He uses the N-word a lot. He does know I'm white? "Nazi." You know, you do atrocities like kill women and children. Is that what you think of me? No, I just don't think of you. Okay. Just because I'm your father doesn't... Look, you know this isn't cool, right? Showing up here unannounced in the middle of... What? This. Everything. Look, I just need a place to crash for a few days. Okay? No. No, not okay. Hey, don't unpack. Relax, Alex. It's only vapor. [Inhales deeply] Okay, it may not look like it, but everything in this house... Shack. ...has a purpose, a place. [Inhales deeply] Don't touch anything. Where are you going? Out. We've all been brought into this brotherhood. Okay, now the traditions in this room... They're not in any books. They're not in a manual. They got passed down from man to man. Our word is our bond. You never dishonor your country, you never dishonor this squadron. This is your family. All right? [Indistinct agreeing] Your replacement, Buddha. The wheel of time turning, the young rising up to devour the old, the snake eating its tail, Oedipus killing his father... I get it, bro. Oh, man. It's about that time. [All cheering] Drink! Yeah! Drink! [Watch beeps] Ready? Go! Go! This is a timed evolution, Chase. Put it down. All  : [Chanting] Drink! Drink! Drink! Come on! You got this! Make me proud, Chase! 1:21! Up! Get it in! Come on! Finish it! 1:27! [All cheering] Ohh! Hey! Good? Yeah. I'm good. Okay, you're not finished. No, come on, guys. No, you're not done. No. No, no, no. This... [Laughter] ...is a symbol of the brothers that you have sworn to protect. Uh-huh. Okay, so... you guard him with your life. [Laughter] Hey, Ghetto, if that needs some air, you know where to blow it, don't you? [Laughter] Oh, you can show him, Buck. You had him last. Yes, he can. [Laughter] And this... the weapon you will use to defend them. Keep it oiled and ready at all times. On your knees. Take a knee. Go down! On your knees! You keep this on you at all times. Man  : All times! I'm deathly serious. [Laughter] Welcome to White Squadron. Don't suck. Welcome, brother. [All cheering] Don't be afraid to live by your own rules. Hey, if you ever try to blow a hole in a steel ship with us in it again, I will take that away. Got it. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. [All cheering] Cheers, guys. Thank you. That was us not too long ago. Total noobs. Yeah, Rip yarded us in. You remember his speech? I know you don't. You were too busy running your mouth. Of course I do. You just said it word for word. All right. Don't look so surprised. I remember everything that man said. Just, you know, don't talk about him like he's dead. [Rock music plays] Now that kid is looking at us the same way we looked at Rip. You believe that? It's a good thing we got it all figured out. [Both laugh] [Pounding on door] All right, everyone out! Out! [Women gasping, whimpering] You too! [Shotguns cock] Na... vy... SEAL. No. Sir. Please. Whatever you want... [Women scream, gasp] I should be talking to you? [Clicks tongue] Terry McAlwain? Uh, yes. Yes. So, you've spoken to SymcoPetro. They'll pay you. Did they tell you that? Whatever it is you want, they'll give it to you. They will. But... we're not animals. Y-You can't keep us here like this. We're hungry, and... Let him see. See what? Your hands. Why? I want him to see how hard you work. Don't do it. Show him! Show him. [Speaking native language] [Laughter] He says your hands are soft, like a baby. [Women screaming] What do you do now? [Clicks tongue] [Clicks tongue] No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! You got to tie that down! Tie it down! Above the elbow! I give the orders! You are Navy SEAL. Special Forces. Na... vy... SEAL! [Coughs] Na... vy... SEAL. Hmm? Navy SEAL. [Clicks tongue] Navy... SEAL. Yeah. I'm a Navy motherfucking SEAL. [Chuckles]
