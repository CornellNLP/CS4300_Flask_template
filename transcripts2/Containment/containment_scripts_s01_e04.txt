 I've seen smallpox scares, SARS panic, but I've never seen anything like this virus before. 
 The agent has been identified as an avian influenza that until now has not been known to be transmitted between humans. 
 Clear! 
 [crowd gasps] 
 Lommers : Shipping containers were placed around the perimeter to secure the border. 
 It's bad, baby. 
 But your office is probably the safest place that you can be right now. 
 Store's closed, everybody. 
 Wait. Wait. You can't just... 
 Xander : What the hell was that? 
 I'm not letting you go through this alone. 
 Katie : Outside the walls of this hospital, and who's in charge? 
 Looks like I am. 
 I think you should stay in quarantine. You have been exposed. You've been outside. 
 Because we went to get you food. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Leo Greene, intheperimeter.com. 
 The fact that Lommers is trying to shut you down means you're doing something right. 
 Leo Greene just told the whole damn world there's a way to escape the cordon. 
 Th... this is the hottest story in the wo... 
 [coughing] 
 I don't want to spend another night away from you. 
 Me either. 
 [signal fails] 
 [tapping keys] 
 I just lost my Internet connection. 
 So did everyone in the cordon. 
 I asked you to stop Leo Greene, and you didn't. 
 So if you're looking for someone to blame, blame yourself. 
 [static] 
 [siren in distance] 
 Lex, voice-over : Our greatest threat in a time of crisis is panic. 
 Unfortunately, cell phones and social media can spread panic like fuel on a fire, inciting unrest and encouraging actions that put the public at risk. 
 These actions affect all of us and compose a greater threat than the horrible virus we face. 
 In the interest of public safety, precautionary measures have been taken to remove this threat from within the quarantined section of our city. 
 Those things give me the creeps. 
 Lex, voice-over : And, fortunately, just 36 hours after all communication within the cordon was shut down, panic has subsided. 
 And everyone inside the cordon is safer be... 
 Dennis : Your boyfriend should run for Mayor. 
 Tony : He is pretty. 
 Careful, or I might forget to let you out of there today. 
 The number of infected is dropping and the virus is under control. 
 Something doesn't feel right. 
 They're called hunger pains. 
 Ignore them. 
 Think how skinny we'll be. 
 Lex on TV : ...these rules laid out by the CDC. 
 This station will run continuously for those residents within the cordon. 
 Keep it on. Stay indoors. 
 And this will be over soon. 
 What's wrong? 
 What are you doing? 
 The infection rate is dropping? 
 It'll be over soon? 
 I know him, Suze. 
 He hasn't lied like that since my 30th. 
 Your "surprise" party? 
 He did his best, God bless him. 
 What are you doing? 
 I need to talk to him. 
 We need the truth, not a government script. 
 I'll be in a clean room. 
 I'm gonna build a phone with the power to call outside the dead zone. 
 You can do that? 
 We'll find out. 
 [door opens] 
 I got to talk to Lommers. 
 I didn't feel good about that. 
 Well, she's in Washington. Be back tomorrow. 
 But relax. You did great. 
 Fellas, give us a minute. 
 All right. 
 Look, the important thing is to keep everyone in there calm. 
 Keep everyone calm? 
 If you want to keep everyone calm, let them talk to their families. 
 We drew a line through the city, tore families apart: mothers from children, husbands from wives. 
 Girlfriends from boyfriends. 
 You're saying this is personal. 
 Fine. It is. 
 But it's not just because of Jana. 
 Those are all our people in there. 
 And they are safer now. You've seen the footage. 
 The streets are quiet. 
 So no one's rioting. 
 But do we really know what's going on? 
 Do they have enough food? 
 Do diabetics have insulin? 
 I got men working triple shifts guarding that perimeter, men with families inside, and they have no idea what's going on in there. 
 Give them an hour a day to talk to their loved ones. 
 That's not gonna happen, Lex. 
 These are the Feds we're talking about. 
 You don't reason with them. You just do what you're told. 
 I get that this is hard for you. 
 But we've got a job to do, a city to protect. 
 Don't screw it up by getting emotional. 
 [siren in distance] 
 [indistinct PA announcements] 
 [door hits heavy object] 
 [door hits object again] 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 Man : Close it up... 
 Cannerts : I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. 
 Lommers : I recommend we institute a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. 
 Lex : What I need is the truth... 
 Jake : Yeah, I'm in the middle of the damn hot zone, Lex. 
 Jana! 
 Lex : If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. 
 [coughing, labored breathing] 
 Sorry. 
 You OK? 
 The lobby. Have you seen the bodies in there? 
 I have, unfortunately. 
 We've converted the lobby to process incoming victims. 
 The hospital is now dedicated exclusively to combating the virus. 
 And I'm sorry you had to see that. 
 Walk with me? 
 Katie : There were so many. 
 I know. 
 We're trying to keep it discreet. 
 No point in spreading panic. 
 What took you up there? 
 I... I was looking for a pharmacy. 
 Something I can help you with? 
 I needed a prescription. 
 Texting it in isn't really an option. So... 
 Zenquell. It's, um... 
 I'm familiar with it. 
 How long have you been diagnosed? 
 It's not important. 
 I'll have a look, see what we have. 
 Thank you. 
 This is me. 
 I'm afraid the lobby isn't the only thing we've been forced to repurpose. 
 [mice squeaking] 
 Jake : Even on a good day, 8 men isn't enough. 
 But with our comms down... communications... we can't call each other, which makes police work tough 'cause you got no backup. 
 So how do you guys talk? 
 Oh, we meet up once a day, fill each other in. 
 It's not ideal, but we got to play the hand we're dealt, right? 
 Why can't they send in more cops? 
 That's a good question. 
 I guess they don't want to risk them getting sick. 
 You got anybody on the outside? 
 Yeah, yeah. I got... I got people. 
 No, I mean, like a girl. 
 [chuckles] 
 A girl? 
 No. Why? Do... do you? 
 No. 
 Yeah, you're right. Girls are gross. 
 Nice! Way to be a role model. 
 Ah. Hey. This is guy talk. 
 You're not supposed to be listening. 
 Yeah, Mom. It's guy talk. 
 Jake : Yeah. 
 Where'd you get that hat? 
 Jake : Oh, I grabbed it for him out of the old Lost and Found. 
 Looks good, right? Did you, uh... did you get what you need? 
 The pharmacy's shut down. 
 Guess I'll have to live without toothpaste. 
 Jake : You see? 
 Girls are gross. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 I need a signal booster. 
 You can't, like, link up our phones to make them stronger? 
 No, it doesn't work that way. 
 I need a directional signal with the power to reach a working cell tower. 
 Not that I don't think this is an awesome idea. 
 Like, it totally is, but what exactly are you hoping Lex will be able tell us if this works? 
 How to survive, how much food we'll need. 
 Is... Are we better off in here or on the move? 
 Or is the water safe? 
 How quickly is the virus spreading? 
 You and I have been through tough times, Suze. 
 But right now, we have no idea of what we're up against. 
 Tony : There. There it was again. 
 [helicopter passes] 
 [tapping on wall] 
 There's someone in the garage. 
 What are they doing? 
 We've only caught glimpses of them. 
 Dennis : How's the phone coming? 
 Slowly. I need to get on the roof. 
 You'll get it done. 
 No one's better at microelectronics than you. 
 Dennis, that sounded curiously like a compliment. 
 Nah, I've been in quarantine for 2 days. 
 I must be delirious. 
 I was just thinking, um, poor isolated Tony and I should, uh, get to make the first phone call. 
 You have an hour to go. Put a lid on the pity party. 
 [computer beep, door opens] 
 Greene : Quiet in here. 
 I guess it takes a lot of men to guard a big prison, huh? 
 So I have something to ask you. 
 First you slap a gag on my friends. 
 Now you won't talk to me. 
 Which friends? The ones that leaked that story about where to break through the barricades? 
 That little news piece of yours, that's half the reason communication got shut down. 
 And what's the other half? 
 Keep the virus from spreading or hide the secrets inside? 
 You... 
 You're right. 
 You're right. We're all just little pawns in this big evil plot to destroy Atlanta. 
 Or at least lie to it. 
 Well, it's sure lucky for Lommers she's found such an honest face to do it for her. 
 That picture you were looking at over there, is that your girl? 
 That's none of your business. 
 All right. Listen, my friends and contacts I have on the inside, I think they're sick. 
 And... and I... I need to know what's happening to them. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 I know how you feel, but my hands are tied. 
 Right, because you let Lommers tie them. 
 Get out. 
 I don't get why you're more loyal to some woman with a fancy title than to someone you claim to love. 
 Singer : ♪ I'm wide-eyed and it's midnight ♪ 
♪ And all I see is you ♪ 
♪ All the heads... ♪ 
 A little distance might be good for the two of you. 
 It'll help you see things more clearly. 
 We see things fine, Ma. 
 Well, when you're done reminiscing, I could use some help in the here and now. 
 We shouldn't even be open. We just had rednecks with guns helping themselves to inventory. 
 I built this store. 
 And it's paid for every privilege you've ever had. 
 So I won't be scared out of it. 
 Now, come help me restock the shelves. 
 Fine. 
 But when Xander comes, I'm moving to Grandma's. 
 What do you mean, "when Xander comes"? 
 He said he doesn't want me going through this alone. 
 He's gonna find his way in. 
 You really are delusional. 
 [clang] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 You shouldn't be alone up here. 
 I... I just need this dish. I don't want any trouble. 
 You're from the top floor. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm from Bitscan. 
 Why are you up here? 
 I know you. 
 I'm around a lot, except for your floor, of course. 
 Sam... 
 Head of Building Ops and Maintenance. 
 Jana. 
 S... sorry about that. 
 [drops pipe] I thought you were one of the tweakers from the garage. 
 Is that why you're up here? 
 High ground's the safest place in a storm, right, except for Bitscan, of course. 
 You got room for one more in there? 
 We agreed no one gets in. 
 I made the rule. Th... they'd never let me break it. 
 [siren in distance] 
 Sorry. 
 Get what you're after and get back to your safe little fort. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't find what you need. 
 I can look for something comparable, but finding the balance in medications like these can be complicated. 
 I'm all too familiar with that dance. 
 Jake : Hey. 
 Everything OK? 
 Yeah. Dr. Cannerts was looking for some allergy medicine for Britney. 
 I'm afraid our pharmaceutical supplies are rather low. 
 Jake : Hey. I'm, uh, I'm heading out on patrol. Have you seen my... my black T-shirt? 
 That one? 
 It was pretty ripe. 
 You actually touched that thing. 
 I wore gloves. 
 [Katie chuckles] 
 I'll trade you for that health hazard you've got on. 
 Jake : Oh, you don't want to touch this one. 
 It's toxic. 
 You really think you're gonna get all this overtime? 
 Hey. They owe, they pay. 
 Is that what your bookie likes to say? 
 Anybody up there hungry? 
 DD's Smokehouse, hot and ready. 
 Look at you springing for the good stuff. 
 You know how I do. 
 Hey, Walden, isn't it your daughter's birthday today? 
 Walden : Lorelai, eight years old today. 
 Why don't you take one of these bags and go share it with your family? 
 I'll take your post. Go. 
 And be thankful that you bought that place in Kirkwood last spring. 
 Thanks, Lex. 
 [squeaking] 
 You OK? 
 I spent my life hunting for a virus like this. 
 Perfect. 
 Now it's destroying us. 
 It won't respond to the drugs I have. 
 And the ones I need are tangled in a web of bureaucracy trying to find their way to me. 
 Nothing gets in or out. 
 Good patrol? 
 Found more bodies over at Renaissance Park. 
 It seems to be a popular place to drop them. 
 Did you burn them? 
 Good. 
 Hey, uh... earlier with Katie, I heard you saying you... you couldn't find something... a medication? 
 I doubt she would appreciate my discussing it with you. 
 I... I wasn't prying. 
 Just, there's a pharmacy across the park. 
 It's probably pretty looted, but I could check it out on my next patrol. 
 Maybe they have what she needs. 
 That's very kind of you. 
 I could use a few things myself. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll make a list. Thank you. 
 [sirens, police radio transmissions] 
 Lex... what are you doing out here? 
 I mean, don't they got you set up in some TV studio, with cute girls bringing you coffee? 
 It's not like that. 
 OK... that's exactly what it's like. 
 Ha ha. You want to trade? 
 Well, you convince Lommers and the gig's all yours. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You got anybody inside? 
 Nah. 
 I mean, I know some people. 
 But it's not like you. 
 Hey! This area's off-limits. 
 Turn around and move on! 
 Lex : Wait, wait, wait. I know that kid. 
 Hey! That fence is electrified. Stop! 
 Hey! No, no, no! 
 Hey! Don't do it, kid. We will shoot! 
 This is your final warning! 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 Xander : That cop shot me. 
 I was just trying to get to my girl, and he shot me. 
 With a beanbag. Quit your crying. 
 Leave him be. It's not his fault. 
 This city's going to hell. 
 [tap on glass] 
 I need to finish this. 
 Finish in the morning. You need sleep. 
 I'll be OK. 
 Hey. Where's your birth mother? 
 Do you remember the first time you asked me that? 
 You were 8. 
 You told me she was stuck in Cuba. 
 I said, "She sent me over on a life raft but got caught before she could climb in behind me." 
 And as soon as she could escape, she'd be coming for you. 
 I actually believed it. 
 Hmm, so did I. 
 I just... I wanted so bad to believe that there was someone out there who loved me. 
 And now someone actually does. 
 Oh, no, Jana. 
 And the only reason why I'm in here instead of asleep in his bed is because I was too damn afraid to let myself believe it. 
 I'm OK. 
 I just need to finish this. 
 
 
 
 We got to stop meeting like this. 
 You got a tracker on me or something? 
 If I said "yes," would you quit trying to break in to see your girlfriend? 
 I think this is the part where you apologize for shooting me in my back. 
 You're the one who broke the law. 
 It's a bad law. 
 And what do you care if I get in? 
 It sets a precedent. 
 When people stop believing in the quarantine, people like you trying to slip in, sick people trying to slip out. 
 O... OK, the thing is, the government says this is almost over. 
 And you're here talking about precedents, like... like it's something we might have to live with for a long time. 
 Which one is it? 
 Just trying to keep everyone safe. 
 My girl Teresa is 9 months' pregnant. 
 Are you saying she's safe in there without me? 
 Congratulations. 
 I'm not missing the birth of my daughter. 
 I'm sorry that you can't be... 
 I just told you. I will be. 
 Damn it, kid. 
 "Kid"? 
 No, the way I see it, I'm the only one of us man enough to do what's right. 
 [indistinct PA announcements] 
 Excuse me. Hi. 
 I'm looking for a patient on this floor... 
 Xander Paulson. 
 Lex : No way. 
 That young man has been through enough already. 
 You are not gonna use him to make headlines. 
 Oh, he's not the headline, actually. You are. 
 Hero cop shoots Romeo in back. 
 I just want to get his side of it. 
 You do not go near that kid. 
 Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? You gonna shoot me, too? 
 Oh, and deprive myself the pleasure of kicking your ass? 
 Ha ha. Is that a threat? 
 Are you physically threatening me? 
 I am ordering you to leave this hospital and offering to physically assist you if necessary. 
 You're going to be on the wrong side of history, Alex. 
 Is this really who you want to be? 
 [thunder] 
 [rumbling inside truck] 
 Atlanta PD. Anyone in there? 
 Hey! 
 [panting] 
 My point is it's easy to say, "Don't worry, girl. I'm gonna take care of you." 
 When that baby is crying and it's 2:00 in the morning, it's another story. 
 Xander is not like that. 
 [Leanne scoffs] 
 Right! No. Xander is responsible. 
 Why is that so hard to believe? 
 Leanne : You really want me to answer that? 
 I was there, too, you know? 
 This isn't all on him. 
 Exactly. 
 Neither one of you are ready to be a parent. 
 [sighs] 
 Who are you to judge? 
 I can't remember the last time you and Dad said something nice to each other. 
 Is that what you want from me? 
 You want me to end up like... 
 [vehicle rapidly approaching] 
 Mom. 
 Good afternoon, ladies. 
 Where's your cop friend now? 
 [Harley's friends chuckling] 
 Harley : Get to it, boys. I want to see if we can fit everything in here in the back of my truck. 
 [tap on glass] 
 How did it go? 
 I found everything, except for, uh, nuclovir and trivinquill. 
 That's wonderful news. 
 Do you think you'll be able to make some sort of vaccine out of this stuff? 
 I wish it were that simple. 
 Vaccines are very difficult. 
 If there were a gene known to be resistant or a subject who showed immunity, we'd have somewhere to start. 
 For now, we're flying blind. 
 What's all this stuff for, then? 
 My hope is to slow the virus down. 
 If I can find an effective antiviral agent, maybe we can keep people alive long enough to find a permanent solution. 
 Come back by in a few hours. 
 You can see how it's working. 
 Yeah. OK. 
 Hey. I'll bring Katie whatever she needs. 
 Which one's hers? 
 That's fine. You can leave it. 
 I'll make time. 
 You've got enough on your plate. 
 I won't ask any questions, I promise. 
 Man : All right. That's about it. 
 Well... 
 You know, we can make room for one more if we all squeeze together real tight. 
 [man laughing] 
 She's 9 months' pregnant, you sick son of a... 
 [gunshot, Leanne screaming] 
 [man speaking commands, indistinct] 
 Jo-jo, would you please assist this pervert with a tourniquet so he stops bleeding on the floor of my shop? 
 Gentlemen, if you could kindly return the merchandise to the shelves and remove your vehicle from the premises, we might just get through this without dropping any bodies. 
 Wouldn't that be nice? 
 Lex : I'd like to commend each of you inside the quarantine on your bravery. 
 I understand how difficult it is to accept circumstances which are beyond your control... to feel helpless. 
 Many of us are separated from our loved ones. 
 We're scared. We're frustrated. 
 And it takes strength to be able to set those emotions aside. 
 But if we can remain calm... 
 But if we can remain calm and do exactly what is asked of us... 
 But if we can remain calm and do exactly what is asked of us, everything will be f... 
 I can't do it. 
 What are you talking about? 
 "Everything will be fine"? 
 There's people dying in there left and right. 
 I understand why the cordon went up. I do. 
 And I will enforce every rule that the suits pass down, but I am not a politician. 
 What do you want to do? 
 You want to get up there and tell everyone how... how scared they should be, how we're not any closer to figuring this thing out? 
 Chief, I bean-bagged a kid for trying to make the birth of his daughter. 
 I nearly broke his ribs. 
 I'll live with that... because I was doing my job. 
 But when he wanted an apology, I couldn't give him one. 
 Because I was staying on message. 
 That ain't right. It's not me. 
 You do this, there will be consequences. 
 Lommers will cut you out... no access, no information. 
 You sure that's what you want? 
 That's her choice to make. 
 This is mine. 
 Mom, it goes Indiana, Illinois. 
 I'm pretty sure Illinois is first. 
 [knock on door] 
 Nice board. 
 [chuckles] 
 I got the idea from the map you made. 
 Smart kid. 
 [indistinct PA announcements] 
 Hey. I, uh, I hunted down that medication you were asking about. 
 How did you... 
 Did Cannerts tell you about that? 
 No. I... I just asked if I could help. 
 He didn't... he didn't say what it was for or anything. 
 OK. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, you got your railroads mixed up. 
 It's, uh, it's Reading, then Pennsylvania, then B&O and Short Line. 
 You know the whole board? 
 I mean, come on. Who are you talking to, huh? 
 Let me help. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 [device beeps] 
 Jana : Easy. Suzy, nice and slow. 
 Once we find a tower, we have to keep the calls short. 
 Our signal's hot. Anyone watching will catch it fast. 
 Wait. Stop. Keep it right there. 
 Dennis : Wait. Wait, wait. Hey. 
 I should go first. 
 I... I'm the only one with children. 
 Jana built the phone to call Lex. 
 He's the only one that can tell us what we need to know. 
 What is Lex going to do, negotiate our release? 
 I mean, my kids are probably out there... 
 Terrified. And you should be, too. 
 We need information. 
 Jana goes first. End of discussion. 
 Where's the kid? The kid. Where's the kid?! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Leo Greene came back with these lawyers and all these legal threats. 
 I need an APB on Xander Paulson, African American male, 5'11", 18, last seen with Leo Greene. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Dispatcher : Copy that. Will issue APB on one Xander Paulson, African American male, 5'11"... 
 [Lex's voice] Hi. This is Lex. 
 You know what to do. 
 ...4 to 6 feet at all times. 
 [continues indistinctly] 
 ...for your protection. 
 Meese : I have a blue Prius registered to Leonard Greene northbound on Randolph approaching cordon perimeter. 
 Copy. En route. 
 Wait. But we have a passenger exiting. 
 Black male fleeing on foot. 
 Vehicle is turning around. Please advise. 
 Pursue passenger, not vehicle. 
 Pursue passenger. 
 [police radio transmissions] 
 Roof. It was all set up. 
 Ladder bridging to container. 
 Rope. It was all waiting for him. 
 Sorry, Lex. 
 [panting] 
 [mice squeaking] 
 The rat on the right is the control rat. 
 It didn't receive any medication. 
 As you can see, it's already beginning to deteriorate. 
 It should start to crash very soon. 
 Poor little guy. 
 Now, if the rat on the left survives longer than the control rat, we may be on to something here. 
 Kind of exciting. 
 Hey, Doc... the rat on the left. 
 Jake : What now? 
 We keep trying. 
 That's science, I'm afraid... more failures than victories. 
 Working on "Chance" or "Community Chest"? 
 Either. 
 I can't remember anything beyond "Get Out of Jail" and "Bank Error in Your Favor." 
 Well, "Take a Walk on the Boardwalk"; "Second Prize in a Beauty Contest." 
 Here. Here. Give me one. 
 Where's Quentin? 
 He's playing with the rest. 
 Nurse Helen's looking after them. 
 This one... is only in the Special Quarantine Edition. 
 "You Win a Shopping Spree." 
 [telephone line connects] 
 This is Major Carnahan. 
 Lex! 
 Jana? 
 God. I can't believe I got through. 
 Is this really you? I mean, how... how... how are you... how are you calling? 
 God! It's so good to hear your voice. 
 'Cause, Lex, I saw you on TV. 
 You were holding back. 
 What's really going on out there, Lex? 
 [signal is lost] 
 Jana? 
 Lex? 
 [sighs] 
 Oh! Uh! 
 Jana? J... Jana? 
 Lex? 
 You OK, Boss? 
 Got a call? 
 [voice of Jana] Hi. It's me. 
 I miss you so much. I, uh... 
 God. I wish you'd answer your phone. 
 Um, I'll try you again as soon as I can. 
 I hope you pick up. 
 Jana on voicemail : Hi. 
 It's me. 
 I miss you so much. I, uh... 
 God. I wish you'd answer your phone. 
 Um, I'll try you again as soon as I can. 
 I hope you pick up. [hangs up] 
 Your girl got a phone? 
 That kid was going in with or without me. 
 I just made it safer for him. 
 In exchange for what? 
 A couple of favors. So what? 
 Greene : You know, we're all in the same boat here, man. 
 I am not the enemy. 
 You know I could lock you up? 
 If he dies in there, that's on you. 
 Oh, he's a smart kid. He's gonna be just fine. 
 I didn't come here to pick a fight with you. 
 No, you just... you just came to chase stories. 
 This is not about stories. 
 This is not about headlines. 
 This is about what's happening to the people we care about and who's responsible. 
 If you want to know what Xander's been up to, log on to the drone footage at sunset. 
 Maybe you'll rethink which side of this you want to be on. 
 [Jake laughing] 
 Wait. Ha ha! How does this even grab on? 
 Yes, yes, yes. 
 That is pure class right there. 
 [laughter] 
 Oh. This is... this is very much me. 
 Ooh. Ha ha! 
 Now you have to take up ceramics. 
 [laughs] 
 You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp. 
 You did? 
 I did. 
 I bet she still has it. 
 Ha ha. Yeah, she would. She, uh, she actually... she passed away when I was young. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 No. It was... It was a long time ago. 
 You know, I don't know why, but I kept the mug. 
 It's ugly, it leaks, and it mocks me from the cupboard when I'm home. 
 This could be the first time I've gone more than a day without checking my phone. 
 Like, ever. 
 Yeah. It's kind of nice, right? 
 It is. 
 [imitates British accent] Well, hello. 
 [chuckling] 
 And thank you. 
 You... you take care of everyone else. 
 You know, you deserve a shopping spree. 
 I mean for the other thing... the pills. 
 I always kind of had a hard time with my highs and lows. 
 It got pretty bad when I was with Quentin's dad. 
 We got into some stuff we shouldn't have. 
 I guess it messed with my chemistry. 
 I went clean. He didn't, which, of course, his parents blame me for. 
 Anyhow, the meds keep me in check. 
 So thank you. 
 Hey, we've all got our crosses. 
 That's it? It doesn't freak you out? 
 [chuckles] 
 What, that you're human? 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 [chuckles] 
 I guess I'm too used to being punished for it, you know? 
 We're all messed up, Katie. 
 Anyone who judges you for it is just... just hiding their own stuff. 
 Your mother-in-law, what's her name? 
 Grace. 
 Grace. 
 [Katie laughing] 
 I bet you Grace has some skeletons... closets full. 
 [laughing] 
 OK. Your turn. 
 My turn? 
 What's your cross? 
 [laughing] 
 Oh, gosh. 
 I don't actually think girls are gross. 
 That's not a cross. 
 It can be. 
 I've, uh, sort of been with a lot of them. 
 It's like, uh, it's like a crutch or a... or a coping m... 
 [chuckles] Whatever. 
 My childhood wasn't a picnic. 
 So I've always had a hard time letting people in. 
 As soon as I try to get close, I move on. 
 I don't know if that's a confession or a warning. 
 No. I... I just... 
 I know we don't know each other all that well or... or anything. 
 But circumstances are making it so we're all getting kind of close in here. 
 You know? So... 
 So don't let me run, OK? 
 OK.
