 What's going on? 
 Possible flu outbreak. 
 There is, currently,  no vaccine and it has thus far proven to have a mortality rate of 100%. 
 Dr. Lommers just called from Washington.  National Guard's on their way. 
 Captain Scott! 
 Carnahan, right? 
 You're walking on thin ice. 
 You like her. 
 Jake :  She's good, Lex. 
 In the kind of way that I feel like I have to do right by her. I think we're being lied to.  I saw two bodies. They were both dead before Patient Zero. From the very beginning, you believed that they were lying to us. What if we can prove that you were right? We just need to get the tape  of the hospital security feed. It's corrupted. Lex :  Get it to Jana. She's the only person I can trust with this. Jana :  Here. Recovered, decrypted... all the footage restored. This place isn't the ivory tower  you think it is. (grunts) Lex, help! Please! Jana! Freeze! Party's over. We have to find a way out of the Cordon. The sooner, the better. Thomas, no. Don't worry. I don't get sick. Cannerts : We are currently 47 hours post exposure. Subject Thomas Graham continues to show no signs of illness. I've inoculated several cohorts of sentinel rats with the subject's serum, sputum and saliva and tested their blood... (squeaking) Ow! Crap! It bit me. Let me see. Ah... Is that infected or control? Maybe it didn't go through the gloves. I'm infected, Doc. Larry... Larry, look at me. Now, check your gloves. (panting) Oh, no. No, no, no... Larry... No! Focus. The next glove. (sobs) (panting) Oh, no. Oh, no. Doc, please help me. Got any eights? Go fish. This way, man. (people gasping, coughing) (gasping for air) Right here. Sir... right in here. I'll check on you in a few hours. Quentin : Got any twos? Go fish! Besser :  Just couldn't toe the line,  could you? Did you think you'd actually be able to breach the Cordon? I don't even know if she's alive. Now, you can discipline me later, but please... help me find out. (sighs) Sorry, son, but you don't have access. That's on you. I heard Jana screaming. Being attacked, maybe even killed. I couldn't care less who I pissed off trying to get to her. Well, you should. Those are the people who could've helped you now. I don't trust any of those people! But you? I thought at least you would've had my back. I've had your back. I've vouched for you from day one. I said you wouldn't be anything like your father. You're suspended until further notice. I'm telling you, it's been two days and the kid's absolutely fine. You were one of my favorite students, Victor, and you know I've always admired your optimism... I've assayed his viral load every six hours and... nothing. I understand it must be difficult there and you want to believe that... If Thomas is resistant, that could be the key to a vaccine. Even if you're able to develop a vaccine, it could take... 12, 18 months? So? That's still hope. More than we've ever had before. Does the Cordon have that long? You should call your sister in Rockville. This line's for official use only. She's worried about you. Well, tell her I'm fine. I'll call when I've found a way to end this. (door opens) Hey. Hey. Well? I see you got in. Yeah. The password was "password." Nice work. Gotta hustle if I want to make detective before you. (laughs) Better keep hustling. Think I finally found the right footage. All right, what are we looking at here? Okay. So here's where it all started. Tuesday at 8:00 a.m. Here's Sanders with Sayid. So Cannerts insists that Sayid was Patient Zero, but we both know Sanders died before him, so if I'm right, Sanders is infecting Sayid here, not the other way around. We just need to prove it. What about the boyfriend? I mean, they-they died around the same time. I went back through the old sign-in ledgers to see if I could figure out who he was. A "Henry Burns" signed in almost every day at 5:00 a.m. 5:00 a.m.? Right there. Oh. Is that him? Jake : There's Sanders. That's our guy. Henry Burns. Where are you going? There's the quickie. Like clockwork. Just like Nurse Helen said. Jake : 5:15. That  was  a quickie. Katie : He stays inside until... 8:16. Wait... Jake : Where is he going now? (sneezes) Did you see that? He knows. He knows he's sick. Jake : He looks panicked. Katie : Who is he calling? Sanders? Jake : Makes sense, she's in the building. What are you doing? That explains why we couldn't find his personal effects, huh? Why wouldn't he want anyone to know who he is? What are you doing? "Closed for maintenance." Burns quarantined himself. We were right. He-He's the real Patient Zero. Cannerts :  I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. Lommers :  I recommend we institute  a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. Lex :  What I need is the truth. Jake :  We are in the middle of the damn hot zone.  (screams) Lex : Jana!  If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. Lommers :  The second Victor needs  a pat on the head, you come running. Oh, don't be reductive. (knocking at door) No, David, it really is that simple. No, it isn't, no, it... Impeccable timing. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Should I come back? No, Lex, it's fine. What do you need? Uh... I know we haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but I'm not coming to you as a cop. I'm coming to you as a person. You know I have someone on the inside. I just need to know she's okay. Will you help me? I appreciate you coming to me, Lex. And I will see about having your sluice access temporarily reinstated so you can get an update on Jana. Thank you. But since you're here... (clears throat) ...I'd like you to meet the Director of Infectious Diseases at Georgetown. This is Dr. David MacIntyre. It's good to meet you. My husband. (indistinct conversations) Two. Faith healer :  Should evil come upon us, the pestilence or the plague, we will stand before this house and cry out to him. And he will deliver us. Our days on Earth are like a shadow. But for those among the living, there is hope. For it is written: "A prayer offered in faith shall save the sick. (coughing) And the Lord will raise him up." He will sprinkle clean water on your head. And he will cleanse you of your impurities. Amen! Amen. He will send the angel of death... This place is as creepy as ever. Hmm. No, it's a little creepier. But when the destroyer sees the mark of the faithful, he will pass over your door... Okay, come on. Can't believe they used to bring us here every Sunday. Those nuns were sadists. Are we really risking losing our lives over this wild goose chase? We should go back to BitScan. Enough about BitScan, Dennis. We're getting out of here. Sam : You lost the vote, man. Take it with some grace. Come on, man. A Civil War tunnel leading out of the city? Are you even hearing this? Faith healer : And it will move. If you have faith, nothing is impossible. Let those without fear or doubt come forward and be healed. (coughing) As you have believed, so it will be done. Lex :  What happened? Jake :  She's fine, I promise. What happened? BitScan got overrun by tweakers. Little hairy for a minute, but we... we pulled through all right. It actually was... it was her plan that saved all of us. You'd be proud. That's good. I mean, she's smart, right? (laughs): Smart. She's a genius. Hey, that reminds me. Our elusive hospital surveillance. She fixed it? Yeah, like a charm. Hey, by the way, don't ever piss her off. Your woman is lethal with a blowtorch. (laughs) Hey, what's with the civvies? Chief suspended me. You're the best cop he's got. Being a good cop and being on Besser's good side... they seem to be two different ideas these days. (sighs) What'd you find? You take a look at time code 8:16, the day before the Cordon went up. That's our real Patient Zero. Name of Henry Burns. He made some mystery call and then ditched his I.D. after he realized he was sick. He went to an awful lot of trouble to hide his identity. You think you can find out who this guy is? I'm sure I can. Listen, this was a one-time deal. Since I got suspended... I won't have access to the sluice. I don't know when we'll see each other again. Maybe not until this is over. Just do what you got to do to blow this whole thing wide open. Will do. Got any queens? Hi, Nurse Helen. Hi, Katie. Come on, Quentin, time for lunch. I can't just leave Thomas. He'll still be here when you get back. Cannerts : Actually, he won't. What's happening? Sit tight. I'm gonna keep you in isolation for the standard 48 hours just as a precaution. But don't worry... the rat that bit you was inoculated with Thomas' blood. And since Thomas can't get sick, the rat can't be sick, either. Katie : How is that possible? We know Thomas was exposed over and over again. At first I thought Thomas didn't get infected because he was resistant to the virus, which would help us make a vaccine. But now I know we can do better than that. I've just discovered that Thomas has viral-specific antibodies, which means he  did  get infected. But everyone who gets the virus dies. Cannerts : Not Thomas. His body defeated the virus, and that will help us defeat it. Do you know what that means? (Thomas laughs) It means Thomas' cells contain the blueprint for a cure. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) Suzy : I'm telling you, it's real. The Confederates used it during Sherman's siege. Tell him, Jana. It's real. We've seen it. Half those people look sick. Faith healer : Whoever has faith has hope. I don't know. I don't get why you didn't tell us about this tunnel days ago. Drop it, Dennis. (faith healer continues indistinctly) It's because you didn't think Suzy could make it out with her claustrophobia. Uh, I can make it. I made it before. That Sunday when we tried to run away after Bible study, we almost made it. Right, Jana? You're right, Sooz. You'll be fine. (indistinct chatter) Sam : What really happened in that tunnel? (sighs) She had a meltdown 20 yards in. She wouldn't go further, and I couldn't get her to go back out. We were stuck there for hours. That's how I figured out she was claustrophobic. Faith healer : Believe... and be healed. Woman : Amen! Driven and tossed by the wind... Woman : Yeah, let him speak! (shuddering) Believe... and be healed! Don't be afraid! Woman : Amen! Let's get out of here. Where's this tunnel? Faith healer : If you believe, you will see... Behind that door is a brick wall. Behind that is our way out. How do we get through? We wait. Man : Preach, preach! Faith healer : Believe! I know you've not been cleaning the place. Oh. Thank you. What'd you find? Checked out that Burns guy. Get this. Got his PhD in microbiology. Suspicious. Did his postdoc in emerging infectious diseases at Emory from 2009 to 2013. And then what? And then nothing. No employment, no presence of any kind on the Internet. So what, he's a spy? See, that's the thing... spies always have convincing covers. You know what that tells me? He's been working off the books. Exactly. I'm gonna get my hacker friend on this. Burns' girlfriend was a doctor at the hospital... I'll see if my friend can track him through her e-mail. And what about Burns' phone records? Who'd he call  from  the hospital? I'd check the records myself, but, uh... I might have a way to get those, too. (beeping) I'm being summoned. I thought you were suspended. Yeah, me, too. (beeping) Yeah? (opens door) Cannerts :  ELISA plate reader, PCR thermocyclers,  cell culture incubator. All right. Tell Lommers we need more firepower. Right. As soon as we figure out how Thomas defeated the virus, we can develop a treatment. (sighs) And then this cordon comes down. Dr. Cannerts. I can't believe this could all be over soon. I know. This feels like it could actually happen. Hey, you know, for someone who's just heard they might not be spending life in prison, you don't seem that excited. Yeah, well, the real world's no picnic. Oh, God. (laughs) (laughing): That sounded terrible! No. Of course I'm excited. I'm just nervous, I guess. Afraid to get my hopes up. Yeah. What about you? No, I'm not afraid to get my hopes up. (laughs) Definitely gonna take a sick day or... or five. You know, hit some ball games, grab some beers. (takes deep breath) Just be nice to not have any responsibilities for a while, you know? Yeah. Sounds nice. (woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.) What is this, a bribe? It's an olive branch. I need you in uniform for this. There's a child under Cannerts' care who represents a chance for a cure. Hope. What do you want me to do? I need you to help me sneak him out of the Cordon. ♪ ♪ Lommers : Thanks to Dr. Cannerts' extraordinary efforts, we now have an unusual opportunity that may allow us to bring a swift end to this cordon. Although Dr. Cannerts has been working around the clock, there's only so much one man can do. It's imperative we get Thomas to the CDC for further study. Dr. Lommers, I must disagree with this course of action. You will field-test any promising drugs, but the actual research will be done here. If Thomas is coming out of the Cordon, I should come with him. Dr. Cannerts, you know that's not possible. Thomas is the only one who's immune to the virus. But I'm the only one who understands how this virus works. If I could... I'm aware that you've been in communication with my husband regarding Thomas. If it makes you feel better, I can have David take point on the research. Now, secrecy will be critical for a successful extraction. If anyone realizes we're letting Thomas out, there could be chaos. No one will see the hope for a cure, just the fact that someone got out that wasn't them. I've asked Major Carnahan to spearhead this operation. Lex? Wait. You're putting the guy who tried to break into the Cordon in charge? As Major Carnahan was instrumental in the construction and protection of the Cordon, no one is better suited to break someone out. He did almost make it past you, after all. Too many eyes on the primary sluice. I've determined that the best course of action is to create a makeshift sluice in an area with sufficient ground cover to obscure direct sight lines. Workmen will cut holes here and here, creating two new reinforced doors, making a new sluice to the Cordon. Scott : A new door is a new vulnerability. I'll need my men stationed above. Armed guards will be visible on top. They will draw eyes exactly where we don't want them... on that door. Maybe you just don't want my eyes on you. Lommers : Gentlemen, give it a rest. You can whip out the rulers later. Captain Scott will be in charge of security, but Major Carnahan will have final word on logistics. What he says goes. And, Dr. Cannerts, you will have that child to the wall at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. Are we all clear? Lommers : Then this is it. The beginning of the end. Jake :  It's the most exposed part of our route. We need to be at the extraction point at 7:00 a.m. And once we've delivered Thomas, we can head back to the hospital. And after that? (chuckles) After that, um... then eventually life... life goes back to normal. (sighs): Jake... After this is all over... if we don't end up seeing each other much, if... this is just a moment in time... I just want you to know I'm still glad I met you. Why wouldn't... why wouldn't we... Don't you want to see each other? (sighs): It's just... Back in the real world, I am going back to debt... and custody battles... and... keeping my chemistry in line, and God knows what else. (laughs) You shouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities in my crazy life. Yeah, okay, what if I want to? You won't. And that's okay. ...this get you down. Why, you're Donald Lockwood, aren't you? 
 
 (door opens) Woman : This is a Cordon emergency broadcast channel. (door closes) You'll never guess the news from the hospital. Dr. Cannerts, he had a breakthrough. Maybe even the key to a cure. Ah, I bet your rats helped. Well, I don't know. Let's celebrate. Take me dancing. (both chuckle) I'll put on our song. All right. (Leonard Cohen's "Anthem" plays) I'll just go find a pretty dress. You look perfect just like that. Prettier than the day I met you. And you're a better liar than you were the first time I met you. Well, just let me go get my pearls on. A girl can't dance without pearls. (both chuckle) Bert : It's still the best day of my life, day I first met you. I wanted to dance with you then, and I wanted to dance with you every day for the rest of my life. ♪ Ring the bells ♪ 
♪ That still ring ♪ (grunts) ♪ Forget... ♪ (clattering) (Micheline shouts) Michi?! It's all right, Bertie, I'm-I'm all right. ♪ A crack in everything. ♪ Lex :  I'll be there in five minutes. Nobody touches those containers until I get there. Your phone does work. Leo, I'm on the move, all right? I will come by your place tomorrow. I have a gift. From my hacker friend. A biohazard package was delivered to Burns from the CDC two days before the outbreak. From the CDC? Yes. You actually think they sent Burns the virus? Of course I do. And we are gonna nail them, man. But we got to have more proof. The delivery notice doesn't say what was inside the package, but the CDC should have a copy of it. So can we use your access to prove that's where the virus came from? Yes, yes, we can. Just not right now, Leo. Priorities, man. You said you wanted the truth. This is what it means to dig for it. I do want the truth. But I want to end this cordon, and... that has priority. What does Lommers got you doing now? I can't tell you. Leo : Ah... So we're hot on the trail of the people who put Jana in this prison, and you want to bail because you're right back in the pocket of its warden. Leo. Leo, you have to trust me. Leo : Trust you! I will get to this, just not right now. Trust you? You mean like the way you're trusting me right now? By telling me what Lommers is up to? Yeah, that's what I thought. Well... Congrats on getting your badge back, Major. (grunting) (indistinct chatter) You mind if I take a turn? Knock yourself out. Hey! Jana : Hey! Watch it, Dennis. Let him get out of the way first. Uh, yeah, I'm sorry. You good? Yeah, I'm good. (chiseling) And let me guess. Dennis suddenly remembered he's got a wife on the outside? Hey, where's your birth mom now? I don't want to play that stupid game right now, Jana. (chiseling continues) (cell phone rings) Major Carnahan. Thought you were busy being a minion. Yeah, so I found a record of that shipment at the CDC. Yeah? What happened to your other priorities? I said I'd get to it, and I got to it. Did you confirm it was the virus? No, it didn't say. But guess who paid for it. A Dr. Victor Cannerts. The Cordon's chief scientist sent hazardous material to Patient Zero? Oh, man, that is good. You really know the way to a journalist's heart. Yeah, well, I poked around Cannerts' office while at the CDC, and nothing. You think you can check his place? Yeah, I'll see what I can find. May need to dust off my B and E skills for it. I didn't hear that. Hey, now that you're back on the force, you think you can get those phone records? One thing at a time, Leo. Hey, look, I'm getting close to the Cordon, (connection breaking): so I might lose recep... Hello. Come on! You got to be kidding! What the hell is this?! I said no armed guards on the wall! You're logistics. I'm security. Came down here and found it unsecured. They will draw attention! You let me worry about that. Stop! Stop! (saw whirring) What is he doing? Your guy wasn't making progress. All right, if we can hear it, they can hear it. What you think they'd do if they knew we were letting just one person out? Let's go. (saw resumes whirring) Big day tomorrow. Can't sleep? Do I have to go? Who's your favorite superhero? Superman. Me, too. You know how he has superpowers? He's from Krypton. He can fly. And he has X-ray vision. Exactly. Did you know that you have a superpower, too? What? Your power is that you give people hope. I know it's scary to leave Quentin and-and Mary and Britney, but you are helping all of us. And we really appreciate it. Thanks, Miss Katie. Good night. (chuckles) Night, Superman. (sighs) You... You think I'll run. And maybe I would have once, okay? But I'm not that guy anymore. If you think that your crazy life is gonna scare me off, you are so wrong, okay? There's nothing out there or in here that scares me as much as the thought of losing you. There's no version of my life... that doesn't have you in it. You can't promise that. I just did. ♪ ♪ (dialing) (line ringing) Hey, sis, it's me. Uh, sorry it's late. Well, not exactly. Micheline : Oh. Don't fret, Bertie. Oh, things will be better in the morning. ♪ ♪

Hey, just... give us a sec, okay? You okay, Sooz? Does it matter? We're leaving. Dennis, man, come on. It's okay. Just go. We'll catch up. (sighs) Quentin :  You may have  beaten me this time, Superman, but my day will come. (cackles) Not on my watch, Lex Luthor. (laughter) Okay, it's time to go. Mary : Thanks for saving me, Thomas. (kisses) Katie : Okay, let's go. You be good. Sooz. I was wrong. I can't do it. You can. Come on. You almost made it before. Remember? We both know I won't make it. Just go without me. I'm not leaving you here. I'll hole up here. Wait till this is all over. Then I'll find you. You have a life waiting for you. Go. Be with Lex! Suzy. It's okay, Jana. I'll be okay without you. (sighs) Yeah, but I'm not gonna be okay without you, so let's just go back. No! I won't let you give up everything because of me. (panting) (sighs) (sighs) Okay, let's go. (sighs) Faster is better. (chuckles) Sooz. (panting) Come on. Careful. Okay. (panting) Bert : Ooh. That doesn't look good. I'm not sure that's gonna heal on its own. I'm fine, mother hen. Stop clucking. I'd say we should go to the hospital, but... I'll go ask Dr. Cannerts what we should do. No, do not bother that poor man about a nothing paper cut like this. I'm going. We'll have our dance when I get back home. All right? (panting) Where are we? I don't know. Where are the guys? (groans) This place is a graveyard. Oh, my God. There must be some sort of gas in here. Help me! Hurry. (groaning) Stand by! As soon as Thomas comes out, I want him on his way to the CDC before the morning rush hour. That's T-minus 15. Assume your positions. Officer : Yes, sir. Everything on schedule, then? I didn't think you were planning on coming down here. You never have before. This is a big day. (indistinct conversations) We're good. Close it. Change the dressing once a day using antiseptic and a new gauze. There are antibiotics in there. Start them now so the wound doesn't get infected. Oh, thank you, Doctor. Helen : That is quite the war room, Larry. Larry : And warm champagne never tasted so good. Sure you won't stay? We found some champagne in one of the surgeon's lockers. This is your accomplishment, too, after all. Thanks, but, uh, my Micheline is waiting. Give her my best. Stop by the cafeteria on your way out. Take a few more MREs home. Larry : To Thomas. Hey, Dr. Cannerts, you want a glass of bubbly? (sneezes) (groans) (retching) (Helen screaming) Go to my office, call Lommers, tell her to abort the transfer. Thomas is an asymptomatic carrier. He can still infect people even if he seems fine. If Thomas leaves the Cordon, the virus leaves with him. No one wants to say it, but... We have to go back to BitScan. It's familiar. We can refortify. Dennis? I'm not coming. No, Dennis. There must be another way out. Look, I just... I can't go back to square one. I can't do any of this. I need to get back to my family. Come back! Don't leave me. (door opens) Let him go. (door closes) (sobbing) How about bowling? Yeah, sweaty shoes. (laughs) Not romantic. You okay in there? Are we there yet? A bit more, kiddo. Lie still and quiet. Just like we practiced. Okay? There it is. Hey, put your mask up. Let's hurry, get this done. Jake : Get him out. Come on. Jump out. Hey. Remember your superpower, okay? Let's go. Hey, buddy. Now, I'm Lex. Thanks for helping us out. This is my friend, Dr. Lommers. Hello, Thomas. You're giving a lot of people hope. I know. That's my superpower. It sure is. We did it. Yeah. We did it. Oh, and I got it. What? Movie under the stars. (chuckles) Literally the perfect date. You in? You ready, pal? Okay. Step away from the boy. He needs to go back inside right now. Miss Katie! Miss Katie! Miss Katie! What's happening? You need to take him back. Woman : Hey, there's a door there! They're letting people out! (people clamoring) Lex : All right, you need to go back to Katie. Sorry, son. (muffled clamoring continues) Ma'am, stay where you are. You've both been exposed. It isn't right! Let us out! Stay there, Thomas, I'm coming! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let us out! Let us out! Cannerts : Don't touch him! Don't touch him. Let us out! Let us out! I was wrong. (panting) I was wrong. Let us out! Let us out! (people clamoring) Stay back. Stay back! Thomas is a carrier. You'll be quarantined here for 48 hours. (scoffs) Get out of my way. (gun cocks) Don't test these guys. I didn't even touch him. But I did. (beep) Max, we have to meet. I got into Cannerts' apartment, I found his lab notebook, and you're not gonna believe what I've got, man. I think Cannerts created the virus. Call me. (shouting, clamoring) (shouting) (pounding, clamoring continue) What the hell is going on out there? What always happens when people have no hope. They fight back.
