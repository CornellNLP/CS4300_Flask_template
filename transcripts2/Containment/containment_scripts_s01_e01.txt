 [soldier breathing, gun cocks] 
 [gun cocks] 
 [panting] 
 [flashlight clicks] 
 [door unlocks] 
 Get to the ground! 
 Run! 
 You two! 
 Get back! 
 [all shouting] 
 Man : You need to trust us. 
 Let us out! 
 We're trying to help. 
 [shouting continues] 
 [gasps] 
 Hey! 
 [motorcycle approaching] 
 Leave me alone! 
 [woman crying] 
 Oh, no! Help! 
 [crying continues] 
 Man : Step back! Get away from the girl! 
 Not a step further, sir! 
 Aah! 
 Woman : Help me, please, somebody. 
 I need help! 
 Woman : Why are you going inside? Please help! 
 Man : Good morning, Atlanta. 
 It is another beautiful day with temperatures expected to remain in the low 60s all week. 
 [jackhammer rattling] 
 Woman : Come on, guys. Settle. 
 Britney, uh-uh. 
 Yes, Miss Katie. 
 Hey, you, sit down. 
 All right. 
 Everybody remember, we're here to help sick people feel better, so behave yourselves. 
 Quentin, are you allowed to do that at home? 
 No. 
 OK, you guys. We're getting off here. 
 I want you all to stick together, please. 
 Let's go. Wait for me out there. Let's go. 
 [squeaking] 
 [children clamoring] 
 Katie : Guys, what did I say about waiting? 
 Why they bringing rats here? 
 They help doctors fight diseases. 
 Duh, Thomas. Lab rats. Hello? 
 Enough with the rats. Let's go. 
 Quentin, don't make me yell. 
 Sorry, Mom. 
 [siren approaching] 
 [coughs] 
 You understand the precautions we need to take, Dr. Sanders? 
 Yeah. I got it. 
 Tell me one more time. 
 Uh, I had just started rounds. 
 The first patient was moved to radiology before I saw her. 
 The second was asleep. We had no contact. 
 The third was the Syrian kid. 
 [inhaling deeply] 
 Sanders  (voice-over): There was no exposure to fluids, Dr. Cannerts, no high-risk contact. 
 Are you certain? 
 I think so, yes. Ah-choo! 
 [coughing] 
 When I went back to look in on him, he was gone. 
 I tracked him down, tried to convince him to stay for observation. 
 He didn't speak much English, but his friend said he wanted to go home. 
 The address is on the chart. 
 The chart. 
 [coughing] 
 [exhales] 
 Jana, hey, honey, I'm sorry. 
 Got held up with the coffee, and then there was this whole thing with the van we got. 
 Mm, thank you. 
 Hey, what, are you coming down with something? 
 Uh... 
 Not again. 
 I'm fine, Lex. 
 No, you're not fine. 
 You're having one of your things, your moments. 
 It is nothing to get worked up about. 
 I'm just a little overwhelmed, is all. 
 On the day you're supposed to move in with me... 
 I know. 
 After 3 years, I know, Lex. 
 Two failed attempts? 
 I know. It's just a lot... 
 You're not even done packing yet. 
 I have Jake outside waiting to help me move you. 
 Yeah. I'm sorry, hmm? 
 I was just having a moment, all right? 
 It was just a dumb moment of doubt. 
 You know what those are like. 
 No. I don't know what they're like because I don't have them. 
 Let's go. She's not coming. 
 Not coming? 
 No. She's not moving in, Jake. 
 Want me to go talk to her? 
 That is pretty much the last thing I want. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Carnahan. Yeah. 
 Yeah. OK. I'll be there. 
 [beep] 
 We got to go. I have a briefing. 
 For what? 
 Some Health Department thing. 
 I don't know. 
 [sighs] 
 Man : How you doing, Lex? 
 [door closes] 
 You're late. 
 I'm sorry, Chief. 
 I just got the call. I was... 
 Getting ditched by your girlfriend. 
 [snickers] 
 That's real nice, gentlemen. Thanks. 
 So what's going on? 
 Possible flu outbreak. 
 Man : State and local officials are present. 
 We're still waiting on federal. 
 Dr. Cannerts is here from the CDC. 
 That's a lot of important people just to talk about flu shots. 
 Cannerts : I've E-mailed you the security footage showing the young, Middle Eastern man in question. 
 We checked his registration forms. 
 His address and insurance information are fraudulent, which may mean he's illegal. 
 We know for a fact that he's contagious. 
 Chief Besser, we need local police to pick him up. 
 Besser : We're on it. This is Major Alex Carnahan, Zone 6. 
 He'll be running point. 
 Man : Well, then maybe he ought to get on it before some kid from the Middle East gives us all the plague. 
 Zone 6 will get it done, Billy. 
 We always do, just like last week's game against you fine fellas from Zone Two. 
 [laughter] 
 All day, Billy. 
 Glad we're all having such a good time. 
 Sabine Lommers, Health and Human Services. 
 Not gonna shake your hand. 
 Nothing personal. 
 The Feds are here. 
 Do we have GEMA present? 
 Here. 
 EIS? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 CDC. 
 Most of you don't know me, but the fact that I'm here should have you worried because I don't get called until things get bad, so let's get started. 
 Dr. Cannerts has identified a possible public health threat. 
 Cat Power : ♪ Hotel room and the street below ♪ 
♪ People come, and people go go ♪ 
 Woman : I'll be back in 10. 
 Man : Yeah. OK. 
 Power : ♪ All the friends that we used to know ♪

 [sighs] 
 Power : ♪ Ain't coming back... ♪ 
 [cash register rings] 
 Mom, I have to... take your 15. 
 You're making me take a break because I have to pee? 
 I'm making you take a break because that's how long it'll take you to mosey back up here after you send your 20 texts to your boyfriend. 
 Teresa, I'm gonna need you for inventory at 1:00, and you have your appointment at the adoption agency at 4:00. 
 No, Ma. I have your appointment. 
 [dog barking] 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 My mom's already in a mood. 
 I had to check on my girls. 
 Come here. 
 Look. We're all set for the 1:30 to North Springs. 
 My mom has a doctor she wants you to see tomorrow. 
 That's nice because mine's got adoption agencies on speed dial. 
 Can you push it to the 3:00? 
 I have to help my mom. She'll know if I bail. 
 We're running away together. 
 They're gonna notice eventually. 
 Yeah, but a head start wouldn't suck. 
 OK. 3:00. No problem. Heh. 
 Um... 
 Xander... 
 Yeah? 
 Are you sure this is what you want? 
 Of course it is. I love you. 
 But I need to know you're all in, that you're doing this because you want to be doing it. 
 Teresa, I love you, and I love our kid already. 
 What else is there? 
 OK. Good. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Look. We are gonna make this work, and we are gonna be happy. 
 Gonna see you at 3:00? 
 I'll see you at 3:00. 
 OK. 
 Cannerts : The patient was highly febrile and presented with pharyngitis, headaches, and swollen lymph nodes. 
 Dr. Rita Sanders was the attending on rounds. 
 Within 16 hours, Dr. Sanders became symptomatic, suggesting that the virus can replicate at an accelerated rate. 
 Sabine : Dr. Cannerts, is it your belief that he is patient zero? 
 Patient zero for a flu? 
 Cannerts : Since then, there are 3 more symptomatic patients... two nurses and Dr. Sanders' boyfriend. 
 Each can trace contact exposure to Dr. Sanders. 
 Besser : Why are we just hearing about this? 
 Local police are brought into the loop at such time as protocol dictates. 
 Dr. Cannerts, what do you advise? 
 We should lock down the hospital while we confirm that the Syrian man is, in fact, the initial carrier. 
 Now, the faster we can initiate contact tracing, the faster we can contain this outbreak. 
 Agreed. 
 What is it? 
 I didn't catch what the virus is we're talking about. 
 Sabine : Well, that's part of the problem, Major. 
 It's not currently presenting as anything we can identify.

 Beats me. 
 [panting] 
 [beep] 
 [telephone line rings] 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 [sighs] 
 What? 
 Don't "what" me. You know what. 
 I had a moment of indecision, OK? 
 The guys had an over/under on how long it would take before you freaked and pulled the plug. 
 Well, the guys need to mind their own business. 
 You can't string him along like you do. 
 I don't string. I had a panic attack. It happens. 
 I know relationship stuff isn't easy for you. 
 Oh, just because you dated me for 5 minutes does not make you an expert. 
 Ha! The fact that you dumped me after 5 minutes kind of makes my case for me, don't you think? 
 I'm at work. 
 You guys are it, Jana. 
 You two have that... that thing that we all want, and everyone seems to know it but you. 
 No. I know it, OK? Of course I know it. 
 Then do a better job of showing it. 
 [beep] 
 Man : Get in his face. 
 Lex, hey. 
 Who was that? 
 Jana. I was giving her grief. 
 Heh. 
 Listen. 
 There's a Syrian kid needs to be picked up for questioning. 
 I'll call you with the details. 
 Jake, you'll run point. 
 I thought I was running point. 
 I changed my mind. 
 What, is this because I took the under on Jana? 
 Shut it, Walden. 
 Who's sending us in, CIA, Homeland? 
 None of your business, much like my relationship. 
 Jake... it's the Health Department. 
 You know the drill. 
 EIS official will meet you there. 
 Please tell me this isn't some kind of Ebola thing. 
 They don't know what it is. 
 So what did she say earlier when she answered your call instead of all 10 of mine? 
 She's just being Jana, man. 
 She'll come around. 
 Yeah? Well, maybe this time, I won't. 
 Ha ha ha! 
 You want me to call bull on that, or you want... you want to call on yourself? 
 Look. I got to head downtown. 
 The Feds want to talk to me. 
 Guess no matter how many stripes you got on a sleeve, you still got to kiss the ring, huh, Major? 
 I guess I do, Officer. Ha! Guess I do. 
 All right. 
 Get it. 
 Katie : 12, 13, 14. OK. We're all here. 
 Ah-choo! 
 Uh-oh. 
 Man : That's her hay fever. 
 Hey! 
 Here. 
 Stop! Stop! 
 Here you go. 
 Stop! 
 [engine stops] 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm sorry, but I have to ask you guys to come back in. 
 We're already late. 
 Bobby : I know, but I can't let you go. 
 Bobby : Please. We'll explain once everyone gets back inside. 
 You heard the doctor. 
 Looks like our field trip has been extended. 
 Aww! 
 Aww! 
 Everyone off. 
 Hang on a minute, Britney. Wait. 
 You, too, sir. 
 Mom... 
 Quentin, stay with me. 
 Bobby : It's better if you don't touch. 
 While you move inside, you'll all need to keep 4 to 6 feet apart. 
 Thought you had the day off. 
 Fried server from Davidson International had other ideas. 
 Did the move go OK? 
 Aw, Jana, again? 
 I had a moment of doubt. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Oh, your cell phone. 
 Don't. 
 It's Lex. 
 I'm not kidding. 
 Poor Lex, just a guy that loves a girl who loves to leave. 
 Suzy, I swear to God... 
 [whoosh] 
 Suzy : You know they have therapy for this kind of stuff, right? 
 Who needs that when I got you, hmm? 
 Ew, germs, germs. Stop it! 
 Man : Hey, Jana, McKinley Research is sending over their CPU today, high priority. 
 Can't wait, Dennis. 
 Well, all right, then. 
 Major Carnahan, thank you for meeting me. 
 Oh, you can call me Lex. You seem important enough. 
 Ha ha! Certainly act like it, don't I? 
 Please. 
 Lex, I asked for you because you strike me as someone who could be a benefit in this situation. 
 People seem to like you, and situations like this are made or broken by the civilians' response to authority. 
 I need someone on the street who can keep people calm. 
 No offense, Ms. Lommers... 
 Sabine. 
 Sabine, but keeping people calm is my job, so I'm not so sure what you're asking here. 
 There are gonna be a lot of opinions flying around. 
 The CDC's credibility took a few hits during the Ebola crisis. 
 Social media is gonna break this before we do, and once the media gets hold of it, well, we're gonna need a face, a man of the people, someone they inherently want to trust. 
 This is in your zone. These people know you. 
 This kid, if he wasn't Middle Eastern, would we be taking all these precautions? 
 It is because he's Syrian that there is an elevated concern about bioterrorism, yes. 
 Lex, I recognize that there's a lot going on here behind closed doors. 
 If I can count on you, your access will grow in direct proportion to your level of cooperation. 
 Oh, I got to be honest, Ms. Lommers. That sounds like a bribe. 
 It's an incentive. 
 I've been doing this job for 12 years. 
 The reason people like me is because I'm fair, I'm honest, and I got a great jump shot. 
 I don't need access. 
 What I need is the truth, and I'm not convinced that's what I'm getting here. 
 [distant siren] 
 Major... 
 I've been doing my job as long as you've been doing yours. 
 I've seen small pox scares, SARS panic, West Nile. 
 Most are news for a day, a week maybe, until the people find a Kardashian to distract them, but I've never seen anything like this virus before. 
 How we handle it, how we handle ourselves will determine whether or not we survive it, so you want the truth? 
 If we blow this, it's not just a hospital in your little corner of Atlanta that's in jeopardy. 
 [cell phone vibrates] 
 [beep] 
 This is Lommers. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I just don't get why you'd let him go. 
 I'm not letting him go. 
 Yeah, right. 10 missed calls? 
 It was perfect the way it was. 
 Why mess it up by living together? 
 It's called commitment. 
 Oh, yeah. You should talk. 
 I see you flirting with Dennis. 
 You think his wife believes in commitment? 
 I didn't say you should be like me. 
 Why are you giving me a hard time? 
 Because I know your game. 
 It's just like in the group homes. 
 Don't let them get too close because they're either gonna give you the boot or you're gonna get taken away. 
 Our crap-ass childhoods play out in every relationship you've ever had. 
 Jake I got... he... well, he had his own stuff... but Lex, he's a good one. 
 [whoosh] 
 
 
 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 [tap tap tap tap] 
 Honestly, Suzy... 
 You want to make it 11? 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Jana, on phone : Hi. 
 Hey. 
 So I'm a jerk, huh? 
 No, no. I didn't mean to get so angry. I... 
 No. It's OK. 
 I would've, too, if I were in your shoes. 
 I just... I love you... [sighs] too much, I guess. 
 [chuckles] 
 There's no such thing. 
 I just need to learn how to let you, you know? 
 Listen. There's some stuff going on by your place, possible outbreak, and it's got everybody worried. 
 I think you should stay with me in Edgewood, just until this gets sorted out. 
 I haven't heard anything about it. 
 You will. 
 Did you unleash a virus to get me to move in with you? 
 Yeah. 
 Ha ha ha! 
 Yes. I did. 
 Clever b*st*rd. That's right. Ha ha! 
 Hmm. Yeah. I'll go to your place. 
 Just until this blows over. 
 No, Lex. 
 I mean, I'm in for good like I should've been this morning. 
 You are? 
 I am. 
 I love you. 
 I'll go. 
 Good. Good. 
 I'll see you tonight. 
 Katie : A potential exposure. That's all they said. 
 Britney had the sniffles, so they took her for more observation, but her mom's boyfriend... the bus driver, yeah... says she's got hay fever. 
 Hey, stop that. 
 Hey, you guys, no running, OK? 
 Hey, I'm talking to Principal Watkins. 
 Mary, no touching, either. 
 [cell phone chirps] _ 
 [beep] 
 I'll call you back. 
 [beep] 
 Grace, I can't talk right now. 
 I know. I'm as concerned as you are. 
 Man : It should be just a few more hours, but I won't be able to make your grandma her lunch. 
 Could you help? 
 Did you call my mom? 
 She's busy at the store, she said. 
 I'll handle it. 
 Thanks. 
 Bye. 
 [beep] 
 [sighs] 
 [telephone line rings] 
 Xander, on phone : Xander. Leave a message. 
 [beep] 
 Hey, I got held up. 
 I'll take the 5:30, but you go ahead, OK? 
 Love you. 
 [cellphone locks] 
 All right. Yeah. Copy that. 
 [beep] 
 All right. The doctors told Lex it only seems to be spread through fluids... blood, sweat, semen, urine. 
 There's 100% a joke there. 
 Yeah? Well, keep it to yourself. 
 Put gloves on and lower your visor. 
 Don't touch anything or anyone. 
 Officer Riley? 
 Yeah. 
 Jim banks, EIS. 
 You take the lead. 
 Not sure who these people trust less, doctors or cops. 
 [dog barking] 
 [knocks on door] 
 Atlanta PD. You speak English? 
 Yes. I do. 
 Great. You know this person? 
 I don't recognize him. 
 Sure that seems like a smart answer, except that a city traffic camera captured the tags on your car when it was used to pick him up from Atlanta Midtown Hospital on Tuesday. 
 Hey, look, sir. I'm not with Immigration. 
 We've been asked to bring him in as it pertains to a potential viral outbreak. 
 Your friend's health is at risk and maybe yours, too, and... and your family's. 
 Sir? 
 He's my nephew. 
 Good. Thank you. 
 You need to step back. 
 Step back, please, and stay 4 to 6 feet away at all times. 
 Thank you. 
 [woman speaks Arabic] 
 Hello. I'm with the Atlanta police. 
 I need to speak to Sayid. 
 [woman speaks Arabic] 
 [speaks Arabic] 
 When did he arrive in the country? 
 Monday. 
 How? 
 He flew in the hold of a cargo plane. 
 His father got him on the plane. 
 I got him off. 
 [woman speaking Arabic] 
 Lena... 
 [speaking Arabic] 
 Lena! 
 Yeah. All right. 
 Those militant groups, they tried to recruit him. 
 He wanted to come to America, to his family. 
 Yeah. Th... that's great, but we need to know who he's been in contact with. 
 He hasn't left the house except to go to the hospital. 
 That flight took a lot out of him. 
 He had a cold, nothing more. 
 What's in this? 
 His belongings. 
 Where's he at? 
 No. 
 In the bedroom. 
 [speaking Arabic] 
 Lena : Sayid... [Lena shouting in Arabic] 
 Jake : Hey, hey, hey, tell her she can't touch him. 
 He's infectious. 
 [man speaking Arabic] 
 Jim : We'll need to take him with us. 
 [woman speaking Arabic] 
 Jake : Just stay... just stay calm. 
 Stay calm. Just stay calm. 
 [coughing] 
 Jake : Damn it, I'm trying to help you. 
 Sayid. 
 Support. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 [coughing] 
 Stay there! Put your hands where I can see them! 
 Put your hands up! Don't move. Don't move. 
 [all panting] 
 Katie : No. Don't come here. They won't let you in. 
 They've sealed the whole place off for a few hours just to be safe. 
 Uh, we're in an old wing. It's all storage. We're fine. 
 What do you want me to do, Grace? 
 They won't let us go anywhere. I'm hanging up. 
 I'll keep you posted. 
 Miss Katie... 
 4 to 6 feet, Mary. 
 I want to see the rats, too. 
 No one's seeing the rats, Mary. 
 The rats are probably the last thing they want us to see right now. 
 Then why did Quentin and Thomas get to go on the tour? 
 Is that what they said? 
 Stay here. I mean it. 
 Everybody stay put. I'll be right back. 
 EIS is with the family initiating home quarantine procedure. 
 At least 3 of them have had direct contact. I think one is sick. 
 [coughing] 
 This is the stuff the guy carried with him. 
 I'm gonna head to the precinct. 
 Actually, I think it would be wise, considering the contact you had, if you stayed here a while. 
 No, no. I had my visor on, gloves. 
 No fluids got in there, man. 
 Just as a precaution. 
 I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. 
 Excuse me, miss. 
 This is a private ward. You can't be here. 
 Sorry. I'm looking for my son and his friend. 
 They went looking for the rats in the research labs. 
 [panting and coughing] 
 I'll help her. 
 Officer, 4 to 6 feet, both of you, gloves and masks, please. 
 Not a good time to let your kid go wandering off. 
 Where... where the hell are we? 
 That guy back there, is it bad? 
 I've got 14 kids here. 
 I feel like I should know if it's bad... 
 Hey, 4 to 6 feet, miss. 
 And my son Quentin, I didn't just let him run off. 
 He was obsessed with the rats. I was talking to parents. 
 Excuse me. We need to get in there. 
 It's restricted. 
 Uh, we're looking for a couple young kids. 
 They'd have been heading for the research labs. 
 Can we just take a quick look? 
 I can't let you in there. 
 Please, I just need to look. 
 Hey, 4 to 6 feet. 
 The officer and I were just in the same hallway as the infected man. 
 Better not get too close. 
 Hey, hey, you're... you're a cop, man. 
 What do you want me to do, shoot her? 
 Here. I ain't dying for this job. 
 [beep] 
 Jake : You're a piece of work. 
 4 to 6 feet, please. 
 Huh. 
 [gasps] 
 Here. Go. Go. 
 Hey. 
 Dr. Cannerts, do you have an update? 
 At 1500 hours, our patient zero took a turn for the worse. 
 The virus appeared to be causing acute encephalopathy in addition to severe hepatic injury. 
 His symptoms escalated to what can be best described in layman's terms as rabid. 
 [grunting] 
 Cannerts : At 1627, there was extreme hemoptysis and hemorrhaging. 
 [coughs] 
 Cannerts : This was followed by a series of seizures. 
 At 1629, patient zero was pronounced dead and his attending placed in isolation. 
 Soon after, Dr. Sanders succumbed. 
 Her boyfriend died shortly after that. 
 According to EIS, several inside the home of the man we now know as Sayid Nassir have begun to exhibit early symptoms. 
 He was fine. 
 He just had a bad cold. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 You did this. 
 This confirms our assessment that Sayid is indeed patient zero. 
 Given this information, I'm afraid I must declare the virus as extremely pathogenic, highly contagious, and fatal in 100% of its victims. 
 [crowd murmuring] 
 Man : My wife Micheline gives them names. 
 This is Liesl, Rolf, Justin Bieber. 
 Quentin : Ha ha ha! That's cool. 
 Quentin, what did I say about sticking close? 
 I'm sorry for the bother, sir. 
 Man : No bother. They were good, nice boys. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, young ones. Let's get you out of here. 
 Freaky mask, Mom. 
 [sighs] 
 Don't ever have kids... unless you do, in which case, sorry. 
 You seem kind of young to have a, uh... an 11-year-old. 
 Well, life is full of surprises, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm Katie. 
 Jake. 
 Ha ha! 
 Right. 
 Ha ha! Right. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 [beep] 
 Angry mother? 
 Something like that. 
 I, uh, share custody with his dad's parents. 
 Long story. Tonight's their night. 
 You're under lockdown. 
 You think that would make a difference, huh? 
 Yeah. I would. Ha ha! 
 Anyway, they live in fear that something will go wrong on my watch, and I live in fear of them being right, so... 
 Bobby : What are you doing down here? 
 My son Quentin... 
 They're officially putting the hospital on lockdown. 
 We're already on lockdown. 
 Well, they don't want anyone leaving for 48 hours. 
 48 hours? 
 Got to be kidding me. 
 Look. I'm not gonna lie to you. 
 This is a unique situation, but we're in good hands. 
 We just have to trust the system. 
 Follow the rules, and everything will be f... 
 Ah-choo! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. OK. Back up. Back up. 
 Katie, go get that other doctor, Cannerts, now. 
 Step aside. Sir, step aside! 
 Damn it! 
 Sabine : Dr. Cannerts has had a breakthrough in defining the virus. 
 Cannerts : According to the latest diagnostic information, the agent has been identified as influenza "A" with hemagglutinin 7 and neuraminidase 2, or H7N2, an avian influenza that, until now, has not been known to be transmitted between humans. 
 It appears the genome of this virus has been manipulated to give it higher pathogenicity and to make it capable of human-to-human transmission. 
 We discovered a vial in patient zero's belongings that had traces of a biological agent. 
 We must assume he brought it into the country and into the hospital, where he infected Dr. Sanders. 
 [murmuring] 
 Given the threat of bioterrorism, this is now a matter of national security. 
 As such, I recommend that we institute top-level containment measures to protect the citizens of this city from any further exposure. 
 What, exactly, are top-level containment measures? 
 Sabine : At this point, protocol demands that we release all nonessentials from the room while federal, state, and local health confer with the Governor's office and the chief of police. 
 Thank you. 
 Nonessentials. That would be you, Major. 
 Teresa : It's all good, Grandpa. I got to go. 
 I'm catching a train to North Springs to see Xander, our little secret, OK? 
 I will. I love you, too. 
 Man : Crazy. They'll back in. 
 What's the deal? Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Hey, what's up with this? 
 Man : This station is now closed. I need you to exit the platform. 
 Up the stairs. Let's go. 
 Different man : Let's go, folks. Up the stairs. 
 Miss, please. 
 Everyone. Let's go. 
 Jana, things have gotten a little crazier since we talked. 
 Don't go back to your place to pick up your stuff. 
 Go straight to mine. You'll be safe there. 
 Call me as soon as you get in OK. 
 [cell phone chirps] 
 Hey, man, where are you? 
 I'm at the hospital. I can't leave. I'm stuck. 
 Lex : You're part of the lockdown. 
 Yeah. I'm in the middle of the damn hot zone, Lex. 
 I mean, some guy just sneezed 4 feet from my face! 
 Listen to me. 
 I have an in with the Governor. 
 No, Lex. They're not gonna let me out. 
 I had contact with patient zero. 
 I mean, it's the freaking zombie apocalypse up there in Isolation Ward. 
 I'm not getting out. 
 Jake... 
 Screw you, Lex, all right? 
 You're the one who sent me in here. 
 Jake. Ja... 
 [beep] 
 Sabine : I really appreciate all of you coming. 
 Ms. Lommers, I asked you what your intentions are for our city. 
 It's Dr. Lommers, actually, since you're insisting on remaining formal, and you don't fall within protocol. 
 Screw protocol! 
 Now, you want me out there in Zone 6 representing your message, you want me on your side, fine. 
 I'm on your side. 
 Tell me what you're doing. 
 We're gonna institute a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. 
 What the hell is that? 
 It means we're placing your zone of the city under complete quarantine. 
 [sirens] 
 [all talking at once] 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Man : I got family over there. 
 Different man : Roadblock. 
 Different man : You can't keep us here. 
 Different man : Ladies and gentlemen, I need your cooperation, please. 
 Step back away from the fences. 
 Man : I have to get to my kids, man. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, please back up. 
 Back up now. Please stay away from the fence. 
 Lex : Coming through. Excuse me. Move back. 
 I need you to back up, sir. I need you to back up, please. 
 Keep this tight, all right? 
 Let us through. 
 Trust me, you don't want to be back on that side. 
 Trust me. 
 Sabine : It is an admittedly controversial action, but a cordon sanitaire has shown to be highly effective in Sierra Leone keeping Ebola under control. 
 With the Governor at the helm, local and state officials as well as law enforcement will outline the proper measures to ensure safety for all involved. 
 Where are you? 
 Xander : I was coming to meet you for the 5:30, but I couldn't get past 10th. 
 They shut down the trains. I don't understand what's going on. 
 Man on P.A. : Stay 4 to 6 feet away from each other. 
 It is imperative that you stay inside and remain in home quarantine. 
 Call the Georgia Department of Public Health or visit their website for further instructions. 
 Xander... 
 Xander : Go back to the store. I'm coming to get you. 
 Man on P.A. : Stay 4 to 6 feet away from each other. 
 Sabine : The Governor and the President are in full support. 
 It's only 48 hours, a minor inconvenience compared to what could happen if we do not take an aggressive stance containing this virus. 
 [Bobby coughs] 
 [cough cough] 
 [cough cough] 
 [squeaking] 
 [squeaking continues] 
 Yeah. No. Don't worry. 
 I'm telling you, honey, she's fine. 
 Her allergies cleared right up when they got her into isolation. 
 Sabine : Each access point to the exposure area will be cordoned off, the borders being North Avenue, the Northeast Beltline, Freedom Parkway, and Spring Street Northwest. 
 All mass transit will be shut down. 
 Roads will be closed, public gatherings cancelled. 
 Man on P.A. : Stay 4 to 6 feet away from each other. 
 It is imperative that you stay inside and remain in home quarantine. 
 Sabine : Given the data we've gathered, the incubation period is anywhere from 16 to 48 hours after exposure. 
 It can only be passed through fluids. 
 Quentin : 1, 2, 3. 
 1, 2, 3. 
 OK. 1, 2, 3. Ha ha! 
 1, 2, 3. 
 1, 2, 3. 
 Man : I know, my love. 
 I know, but it's only 48 hours. 
 1, 2, 3. 
 Do you have everything you need? 
 Yes. Teresa took good care of me. I'll be all right. 
 You just worry about yourself and stay safe, Bertie. 
 Bertie : I will. I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Sabine : Once we're 48 hours disease-free, our lives can go back to normal. 
 Until then, have faith in the authorities and please know that everyone is working to keep us all safe. 
 Lex : Look. We need you all to back up, please. 
 Ma'am, please, I need you to back... 
 This is just temporary. 
 People, trust me, you do not want back in that part of the city. 
 Now back up, please. 
 I need you to find somewhere to stay for the next 48 hours. 
 48 hours? 
 The City Crisis Center will help you make arrangements. 
 I know it's an inconvenience, but, trust me, it'll be worth it. 
 John, Allens, lock this up. 
 I'm going to my house! 
 Lex : Excuse me, please. 
 Nobody comes through here, all right? 
 Yep. 
 I want to go home! 
 I know. I know, and I'm just... 
 Jana? 
 Jana! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no! Jana! Jana! 
 Clear! 
 [all shouting] 
 Man : Get your hands off of me. You can't do this. 
 Just stay down. Stay down. 
 What are you doing? 
 Let me in. I'm just trying to get inside. 
 You can't go in there. 
 Hey! Hey! Hey. 
 Get off of me. 
 He's just a kid, Pete. Take a walk. 
 Hey, I can't let you through there. 
 I'm sorry, but it's for your own good. 
 My girl is in there waiting. 
 So is mine. 
 If I let you through that barrier, I'm risking your life, and if we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. 
 I can't be that person. 
 I can't let you be that person. 
 You understand me? 
 Come on. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Yes. 
 Now look. 
 We have to trust the doctors, all right? 
 They'll find a way to stop this. 
 Everything will be fine, all right? 
 All right? 
 OK. OK. 
 Hey, Alvin... 
 Yes, Major? 
 Take care of this young man for me. 
 [sirens] 
 Sabine : With communication, trust, and cooperation, this will be over before it begins. 
 Thank you. 
 [all shouting] 
 Teresa : Aah! 
 I need help!
