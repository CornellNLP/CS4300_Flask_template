 The eyes of the world are on us. 
 Once that virus is out, it is out. 
 There's a child. 
 I don't get sick. 
 Thomas's cells contain the blueprint for a cure. 
 Lommers :  I need you to help me sneak him out of the Cordon. 
 If this is just a moment in time, I just want you to know I'm still glad I met you. 
 Jake :  There's no version of my life that doesn't have you in it. 
 We have to find a way out of the Cordon. 
 I think we're being lied to. 
 I saw two bodies... they were both dead before Patient Zero. 
 Jake :  Surveillance footage from the day the outbreak started. 
 Henry Burns. 
 He's the real Patient Zero. A biohazard package was delivered to Burns from the CDC. Lex :  But guess who paid for it. Dr. Victor Cannerts. (screaming) (Cannerts shouts) I was wrong. Thomas is an asymptomatic carrier. If Thomas leaves the Cordon, the virus leaves with him! Thomas : Miss Katie! You need to take him back! They're letting people out! You'll be quarantined here for 48 hours. Get out of my way. (guns cock) I didn't even touch him. Lex : I did. (radio static) (radio static stops) _ (panicked shouting) Man : We know you're in there! This location was a bad idea! It would have been fine if things had gone to plan. Lose your gloves. You touched him, with your gloves. Thought this thing was only transmitted through fluids. Man : You cage us like animals and leave us out here to die! Woman : Open up! Today... We're getting out! Your job was to find a spot where they would not see us taking the child. And they didn't! We weren't supposed to send him back in there! Dr. Cannerts assured me that Thomas was not infectious, that his body had eradicated the virus, that he was the blueprint to the cure. (clamoring continues outside) The only mistake I made was trusting him. What's happening out there? They're leaving. Why? My guess is to get more people. Cannerts :  I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. Lommers :  I recommend we institute  a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. Lex :  What I need is the truth. Jake :  We are in the middle of the damn hot zone.- (screams) Lex : Jana! If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. Thomas :  Don't worry, Miss Katie. I'm okay. Now I get to stay with you. You're amazing, Thomas. Do you still think I have superpowers? People seem kind of... scared of me now. Are you kidding? Your powers just got stronger. Everyone here has more hope knowing you're with us. Thanks, Miss Katie. Do you think Quentin wants to play cards? I'm sure he does. I'll ask him. Hey. You're as tough as they come, bud. Huh? Oh, wow. Hey. You okay? I don't like this. Cannerts has been lying to us since day one. I don't like leaving Thomas in his care. That boy should be with me. Yeah, yeah, you're right. He should be, okay? But that is not an option. Look, Cannerts wants to see the antidote just as bad as the rest of us. So now you trust him all of a sudden? No, no, of course not. Okay, but right now, he's the best chance any of us have got. (door closes) Katie : Hi, Bert. Everything all right? Dr. Cannerts asked me to come by and check on Thomas for him. Why didn't he come himself? The doctor has quarantined himself in his lab, because of how close he worked with the boy. He'll be fine. We're still in good hands. Yeah, I'm sure you're right. You two need to smile more. You look good together. I met my Michi during dark times as well. But we made a point to try to change that. Spread a little sunshine. She sounds wonderful. And then some. I'll go check on the boy so I can get back to her. Got to get some medicine to her. She okay? Got a cut on her leg. I'll take good care of her. You two... spread that sunshine. Yeah, thanks. We will. (chuckles) (door beeps) (air hisses) Teresa? Xander? Maybe they got smart and got out of here. (air hisses) Awesome. Just the way we left it. Only now it smells like meth. If this is gonna be home, we better get cleaning. Ya think? Easy, Suzy. Maybe Dennis was right to ditch us. (exhales) I'm not sure I can make it. One step at a time. Our girl deserves a clean home to welcome her into this world. And your grandparents will be happy to see you. (groans) It's like a bowling ball in my spine. She's gonna be a tough one. Hardheaded, just like her daddy. More like thick-skulled. (glass shatters in distance) Right now this thick skull is set on getting you to your grandma's, so... keep those feet moving. I hate you so much. Yeah, I know you do. Come on. But he's not sick, right? No, Mary, Thomas is fine. He... he just needs to stay in his own room from now on. They've been yanking our chain this whole time. There's no reason these kids should be in here. If they're not sick, they should go home. Hey, Ray, will you try to stay positive on this? Hey, you know what I think Thomas would love, guys? His freedom? A game. Yeah? Oh, what a great idea. Why don't you guys go make him a new board game? He would definitely like that. Come on. Masks, please. Ray, could you keep an eye on them? Nice work. Well, just spreading sunshine. (laughs) Hey, uh... so I was thinking about that date we were planning. Seemed a lot more fun to talk about it when we thought we might be getting out of here. Yeah, I'm not sure I'm willing to wait for that. Normally, I'd push for, uh, you know, dinner, large amounts of alcohol, but you seem to be breaking all my rules, so how about lunch? Lunch? Yeah, isn't that something girls do for, like, a first date? To see if they're interested in a guy? Yeah. But that generally happens well before they shower together. Well, we can skip to that part again, if you want. I mean, it was... No, no, no, no. I like this new you. Very respectable. I could do lunch. Great. Lex (recorded) : Hi, this is Lex. You know what to do. (beep) Lex, this is not a good time to go radio-silent. This lab journal links Cannerts to the virus, but I can't do anything with it. What I need is proof that Patient Zero called Cannerts when he realized he was infected. I have got to have those phone records, man. They're gonna show that Cannerts knew exactly when and how this virus got out. All right? Don't make me do this without you. Lommers : There's still no sign of them. Oh, they're out there. Anger like that won't die down easy. A demonstration is the worst thing that could happen in there. We cut them off from the world. Told them things would get better when they were only getting worse. You can only lock people up and lie to them for so long before they revolt. And that would be suicide. We can't let that happen. So you got a plan to stop it? (door opens) Stand back, please. I need to speak to Captain Scott. Food and water for two days. Empty the bucket, use it for waste. There were people outside this container. We're aware. They've moved on. Moved on how? Have they dispersed? They're protesting in the street. We'll keep an eye on them. How many are there? Stay hydrated. I need a line to Captain Scott... his people are gathering close together, and any of them are infected, the virus will spread like wildfire. I'll relay the message. Woman : We want out! Man : Let us out of here! Crowd (chanting) : We want out! We want out! (chanting and clamoring continues) Come on! I'm not saying it's not a pretty name. It's just... You know what? Maybe it'll grow on me. (crowd clamoring nearby) Stay right here. Crowd (chanting) : We want out! We want out! (chanting continues) Those people are marching way too close together. (chanting continues) That's the way to my grandma's. Come on. We don't want to go anywhere near that madness. No, we'll wait it out. You know, let it die down. (sighs): Okay. Tell baby Caitlin to hang tough. Mm. Yeah, when I hear you say it, I kind of hate it, too. Yeah. We'll find her a name. I promise. (sighs) Mom, have you seen my cards? Check under your cot, baby. Thanks. I think it looks prettier down. Oh, do you? Who says I'm trying to look prettier? Maybe I want to look smart or kind or funny. You like him, don't you? (chuckles softly) Maybe. Do you? He says we're going to a Hawks game when we get out of here. Just the two of you, or... am I allowed to come? I guess you could come. We'll make it, like, a family thing almost. Let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Go have fun. Your hair is fine. Either way, you look pretty. No disinfectant, no bleach, no fresh gloves. How long does it take to hunt down a walkie? Maybe if you pace faster, it'll speed things up. What is your issue with me, Major? I have given you nothing but opportunities. To do what, exactly? Be your puppet? To smile and lie for you? Information needs to be managed in a crisis. I thought you understood that. Oh, I do. But you're managing what you tell me just as much. When have I ever been less than honest with you? You can start with the day you showed up here saying this would all be over before it began. Truth is, you knew better from day one. Did I? There is no way these shipping containers show up here so fast unless you ordered them before you even got on a plane. And what about the cell towers that were prepped to go dark on your command? Those are not steps you take in a crisis you plan to be over in 48 hours. You're right. I had the containers and the phone companies on hold from day one. What are you accusing me of, being prepared? I'm accusing you of knowing more than you let on. What really happened when that virus broke out? What is it that you don't want to tell me? The enemies I fight, Lex, don't give a rat's ass about humanity. A virus doesn't care about politics or race or emotion. The truth is, I had no idea where this outbreak was going. But I made damn sure I was prepared to stop it. Next time, that's what you say on day one. This would go a lot faster if there was three of us. She just needs space. She's pretty broken up about Dennis leaving. Yeah, I kind of picked up on that. I'll go talk to her. All right, I'll take this stuff down, hit the supply room for some disinfectant. (beep) Suze? Hey, Suzy? Suzy? Suzy? (knocking) Hey, you got a small cheese here? Yeah, just throw it on the table anywhere, please. Would you mind if I borrow your work phone? My work phone? Yeah, your boss gives you a phone so his business pops up on a customer's caller ID when you call. May I borrow it? What's wrong with yours? Oh, it died. It's a long story. No, no, no, you keep the change. Just let me use your phone. Just make it quick. (dialing) (line ringing) Woman : This is Nancy. Hi, Nancy, this is... Chip with Cheesy Pies. I have a delivery for 1132 Bay. Uh, no. I-I'm sorry. The wrong number. Uh, I don't think it is, Nancy. I have a custom pie here, which is not something you want to let go to waste. I didn't order a pizza and I don't want a pizza. Trust me, you want this one. 15 minutes. Thank you. Crowd (chanting) : We want out! We want out! (chanting continues, motorcycle revving) It's getting worse. We can either turn back or we can go for it right now. Teresa : I'm not turning back. All right, don't stop moving. Slow and steady. Come on. Okay. Mom? Mom! Easy, Tee, that wasn't your mom. Yes, it is! It's a long block. You probably didn't get a good look! That's my mom, Xander! All right! Teresa : I made her that jacket! Okay... Mom! All right! Can you stop her, please? Even if she's sick, I need to see her. Tee. Tee, it's been almost four days. You know what, all right. Here, hold this. Don't stop moving, all right? I'll find you. Just... keep your distance. Hello? Jake? (strums guitar) (laughs) ♪ Oh, Katie ♪

I could check in the lost and found, see if they've got another pair. Please do that. (laughs) So, what's on the menu? Oh, well, we have a, uh, a fine assortment of dehydrated meals. Um, I hear the vegetarian taco pasta is-is heavenly. Is that right? Yes, and we also have some dried fruit. Okay. And if you're lucky... there might be some astronaut ice cream. (gasps) There might be. You really spared no expense. (both laugh) You play? Hmm? A little. Hmm? I never play for anyone except Quentin. Please. Fine, but you cannot laugh. Wouldn't dream of it.

He said people are breaking out. Did you see where they went? No. Come on, bud. (people chattering) I swear you look more beautiful every time I see you. Can it. This better be end-of-days important, Leo. You know better than to call me at work. No, that was a legit pizza phone. You got nothing to worry about. So I assume you heard about Melinda and Allie. You posted images of their bodies on the Internet. And that's exactly what they would have wanted. You're probably right. Once again, I'm the minority voice. 
 
 Why am I here? Because I'm about to find out why they died. This virus was created by a doctor at the CDC. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. No, I have proof. I have hard, factual proof that this doctor was working with this virus... Leo... prior to the outbreak. I work for the NSA. Do you have any idea how many resources we have devoted to finding the cause of this? You're looking in the wrong places. But you've cracked it single-handed. Look, all I need is a phone record. Maybe the transcript of a call. Oh, is that all? So I just need to abuse my NSA access and commit a federal crime. Perfect. Just hear me out, please. The call was made by Patient Zero... The real Patient Zero... the moment he realized he was sick. Now, I have footage of all this. Whoever he spoke to made him dump his I.D., his phone, everything. Then he put himself in isolation and tried to remain anonymous. That's his name and the time he made the call from his phone. Why should I risk everything I have for this? It won't bring them back. Won't save any lives. No, it won't. But our friends died searching for the truth, and you're just a few keystrokes away from finding it. You really want to deny them that? Crowd (chanting) : We want out! We want out! (chanting continues) Xander : Leanne! Leanne! Hey, hey, help me, man. Please. Help... You're welcome. (chanting continues) (motorcycle approaching) Give me your stuff! (groaning): Oh. Oh. Lommers : You want to go find your girl? Now's your chance. No one in, no one out, Dr. Lommers. She must be very special. She is. Smart. Smart like you wouldn't believe. And driven. Beautiful. Met her at a bar, if you can believe that. My buddy Jake's birthday. She threw an elbow at this guy who tried to do a body shot off her neck. (laughing) b*st*rd tried to press charges. (laughs): Yeah. Well... my husband and I... met in graduate school. He was... (door opening) Captain Scott is on for you. Captain. We have a situation. The group of protestors is growing. We're concerned they may attack one of our sluices. If there's enough of them, they'll pull the doors right off. We can't allow that. Understood. We positioned a food supply in front of each sluice aimed to dissipate their intent. You need to be positioning snipers. It's not the National Guard's practice to fire upon unarmed Americans. Captain, if you let this virus out, there won't be any Americans left. Yeah, I'll take that under advisement. Over and out. Anything? I checked every floor; there's no sign of her. She wouldn't just run away, would she? Wouldn't be the first time. Where the hell were you? On the roof. Why? Is that a problem? When you don't tell anyone, yes. Well, you guys were busy playing house. I figured you wouldn't care. Wouldn't care? Suzy, I have been a wreck searching for you. Whatever! Okay, so there's a prison break going on out there. People are busting out. I say we join them. What are you talking about? Protestors, hundreds of them. I saw it from the roof. They're gonna break through the barricade. Suzy, that's insane. This whole thing is insane, Jana. Well, you guys can stay here and rot if you want, but I'm getting out. (crowd chanting, clamoring, saw whirring) Man : Hey, get me out of here! (woman shouting) Crowd (chanting) : We want out! We want out! This isn't good. I don't see them. (engine revving, chanting continues) Man : Let's get out of here! (tires screeching) Come on. What's wrong? My uniform. I'm a moving target in this thing. Here. I'll ditch the gear and circle back. Just tuck in here. I'll be right back. Remember when you were a kid, and you thought that the grown-ups knew everything, and the president was the smartest man on the planet? And you were going to be an astronaut. I was gonna be the president. (both chuckle) Yeah. And then the older you get, the more you realize how rare it is that someone who deserves to be making the important decisions is actually in power to do so. And that if you want to be one of them... you better be tough as nails. Oh, I'd say you got that covered. If that were true, I wouldn't be sitting in this box, terrified that we're both gonna die. (walkie-talkie chirps) This is Lommers. Scott : They're at the sluice. Food didn't work. They're prying at the hinges. Position snipers. Use tear gas and water cannons first, snipers if there's any risk of a breach. Negative. Captain, a breach cannot happen. And it won't. I'm sending in a unit to subdue the crowd. Negative. Captain, that is a negative. Under no circumstances are you to send in troops. We have no tear gas or water cannons on site, and I'm not using snipers. My men are going in. Captain, you will sentence your men to die in there. Do not do this. My men are not the APD, Major. They're trained for this. People need reassurance. They need to see boots on the ground. Trust me, this is what we do. Captain, this is a different situation. You are dealing with an active virus. Captain, I am forbidding you from sending in your men. I've got the governor's approval. I don't need your permission. (men chattering) Man : Keep it moving! I said, go! Keep it moving! Face masks down at all times! Avoid physical contact! Lex (over walkie-talkie) : Captain Scott... Man : Understood, sir. Do not fire unless in self-defense. Lex : Captain Scott. (walkie-talkie beeps) Let's move. He turned it off. (helicopter whirring in distance) I've managed more than 20 epidemics in my career. And this is the one I lose to? (siren wailing in distance) Do you know what happens to a virus when its host dies? The virus dies with it. Doesn't serve the virus to kill its host so quickly. It's suicide. A smart virus keeps its host alive. Hepatitis, polio, HIV. Beautiful, evolved viruses. This virus? It isn't smart or elegant. It's just brutal and short-sighted, and it doesn't deserve to win. And it won't. Sending those men in may be a mistake, but that's not on you. Sabine, whatever happens, you will fix it. No matter what we face, when we get out of here, this will still be your fight to fight. 'Cause those people inside the Cordon... They're gonna need you. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were finally on my side. (clamoring, chanting continues) Man : Up! Pull it hard! Open up and pull it hard! Meese? What the hell are you doing? Surviving. I need your help. I'm looking for a guy with two 11-year-old girls. Are you serious? What? You still playing cop? Come on, Meese, let's go! Yeah, I'm still playing cop. You're running with these guys now? Hey, don't guilt me. At the end of the day, I'm gonna live through this. You know what happens to heroes. They die, Jake! You're not going out there. Yeah, we'll see. Do you really think those people stand a chance? Huh? Do you think the government will actually let them break free? They'll kill every one of us before they let that happen. Gee, your boyfriend's really fighting for the good guys, isn't he? Don't you dare make this about Lex. Or me, or even about being locked up in here. This is about Dennis, nothing else. So whatever he did or said is not my fault. Now, I have seen you through a lot over the years, Suzy, but this Dennis thing... this is small-time. I'm sorry that he left, but that is what happens when you sleep with married men. They leave, and you knew that, so get over it. I think I'm pregnant. (scoffs) (sighs) (clamoring continues, glass breaking) Ray! Ray! Britney's under my care. If I decide to get out of here, we're gonna get a... Listen, no one's getting out. No one's getting out. (glass shattering) Where's Mary? What? We had to leave her. Leave her where? Why? She got sick. What, you mean like sick sick? (clamoring continues) Crowd (chanting) : We want out! We want out! (chanting, clamoring continue) Man : Beat him down! Come on! Mary? Mary! (engines revving) Mary! Mary. Mary, wake up. (groans) (grunting) (crowd clamoring) (loud thumping and shouting outside) (loud, overlapping shouting) Tee?! Tee?! Katie?! Scott : C Company, you have a confirmed go. Keep your visors down at all times. Go! Go! Go! Go! Man : We want out! We want out! Katie?! (screaming) (screams) (gasps, groans) (clamoring continues) You need to trust us. Let us out! We're trying to help! Help me! Give me that! I need help! (clamoring continues) Hey, it's me! Xander, thank God! Are you okay? I got knocked down. They weren't sick. I just can't get up. Help me. I can't, Tee. I bumped into someone. I might be infected. What did you...? Did you... did you touch them? I don't know. I mean, it's crazy. I found the one lady in the jacket; it wasn't your mom. Xander, that sick person... did you touched it? I don't know. (screaming) Guard : Get away from the girl! Not a step further, sir! Sir! Sir! (clamoring continues) (screaming) Don't! Back! Fall back! Woman : Get off me! (gunfire) (panicked shouting, screaming) Fall back! Fall back! Inside! Inside! Please, take me with you. I'm not sick. I'm sorry. We were only trying to help. The first crisis I worked was in Ghana. Some tropical bug was dotting the countryside with corpses. My mentor at the time was a British man, Dr. Hughes. Smart. Handsome. Nothing like that. He was much older than me. He knew everything. He was three steps ahead of the virus at every turn. I wanted to be like him. Then he got sick. He was dead within a week. Sorry to hear that. I knew in my line of work there were inherent risks, but somehow I thought that a man like that would be above them. Even the best cops get shot. Unfortunately, in this case, it was his own fault. He'd grown close to one of the patients, held the man's hand when he was dying. He was... lost in the moment, didn't see the tear in his glove. It was his compassion that killed him. (clamoring continues) Man : Somebody, please, help me! Help me! (shivering) (grunts) Katie! (quietly): Oh, God. I couldn't save her. No. I tried. I tried to save her. Put her down. Katie, put her down. She's dead. Put her down. Put her down. Please, just put her down. Was she...? A-Am I? I don't know. (gasping) I don't know. I don't know. Come on. _ How long have you known? (sighs) You took a test, right? My body's like clockwork. I don't need a test. (sighs) In case you hadn't noticed, there's been a lot going on. Yeah, exactly. Maybe it's just stress. You sound like Dennis now. You told him? Last night in the church. We were talking and... (sighs) Anyway, I said that I hadn't thought much about whether or not I would keep it or not, but that if we got stuck in here for much longer, then I wouldn't really have a choice. And he got upset that I hadn't told him sooner and... then we didn't really talk much after that. And you think that's why he left? Wow. I knew Dennis was a douche, but... wow. I know how to pick 'em, huh? Look, first things first. I'll go get a test. There's a shop around the corner. I mean, I'm sure it's been looted, but I'm guessing pregnancy tests aren't in high demand. No, I-I don't want you going out. The riot's over. Plus, maybe I can get a few extra supplies. What would I do without you, Jana? Lead a life of isolation and misery? (chuckles) Yes. (both laughing) Yeah. Hey, hey! Four to six feet. We're waiting on a casualty report. Estimates don't look good. Is there still the threat of a breach? No, ma'am, the crowd is subdued. How did you manage it? We put snipers on the containers. And the men you sent in? We have them in isolation. Hoping for the best. Notify their families. They deserve to see them before they die. (walkie-talkie beeps, static crackles) Lommers : What? I should've been more sensitive... to his feelings? Well, you said it, not me. Well, you know, two weeks ago, I was in a beach house in Nantucket on a vacation I planned with my husband for over a year, just to catch up. I love Nantucket. Coming here was the last thing I wanted to do, and now I'm stuck in this box wondering if this fight will be my last. This virus doesn't care. So neither can I. It doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry that the conspiracies in your head don't align with reality. You asked for Henry Burns's phone records... there they are. Nothing with Victor Cannerts? Not in the past six weeks. Not to his office, cell or home. Why would Burns call a burner phone? He didn't. That "Anonymous" you see instead of a number doesn't mean burner. We can pull the digits off a disposable, no problem. The phone your Patient Zero called was a protected line. Those are for, like, top level brass, right? Like, uh, situation room people. Almost no one has them. I was lucky to lock down its location at the time of the call. I am toast if I get caught for this. So, what do you think, maybe one of Cannerts' colleagues? Someone high up at the CDC? Who knows? But you're on your own now. I'm not pulling travel records for every official at the CDC just to see if any of them were in Nantucket two weeks ago. What's in Nantucket? I'm sure you'll figure it out. Hey. Thank you for this. I didn't do it for you. I did it for Mel and Allie. Good luck, Leo. Thanks. It'll be like a sled. I can pull you and sing Christmas songs. You can't sing. What? Oh, you don't know. You are getting caroled. All day. Xander! Jana. I thought you were breaking free. Yeah, that didn't work out so well. Wh... Are you okay? Uh, fine. It only hurts when I move. What are you doing out here? We're heading to her grandma's. And you've made it how far? Come on, you're gonna come back with me. I'm not leaving you out here. (sighs) Some first date, huh? We don't know she was sick. Ray's as paranoid as they come. I mean, I don't trust anything that guy says. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure you're right. ♪ Don't let me show cruelty... ♪ You want me to go get Quentin? You ready to see him? ♪ Don't let me show ugliness... ♪ (quietly): Yeah. ♪ Though I know I can hate ♪
