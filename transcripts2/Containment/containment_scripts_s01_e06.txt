 Cannerts : The virus can replicate at an accelerated rate. 
 Lommers : We're placing your zone of the city under complete quarantine. 
 Quentin. 
 Sorry, Mom. 
 When will our parents get here? 
 When the quarantine is over. 
 Then we'll all be sent home. 
 I've come to take my son. 
 But he's been exposed. You can't. 
 I said I've come to take him home. 
 Xander : I'm at your friends' house now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sam. Head of Building Ops and Maintenance. 
 [Men screaming] 
 Dennis : Well, he's not coming in when your 48-hour quarantine is over. 
 I want you in charge of a food drop. 
 We don't have the men or the resources to handle a drop of this magnitude. 
 Meese walked out on the pallet trying to be a hero. 
 Lex : Meese! 
 Meese : Get me out of here. 
 Lex : I can't. 
 Walden : You can't turn your back on a brother in blue. 
 I think we're being lied to. 
 I saw two bodies. 
 They were both dead before Patient Zero. 
 Did you check the security tapes? 
 Yeah, they tape over them every two days. 
 The hospital is state-run, so, there must be backup drives. 
 You gonna sell this back to the people you just stole it from? 
 You got a problem with capitalism? 
 [Ahchoo] 
 Man on radio : Good morning, good folks of Atlanta. 
 Brace yourselves for this one. 
 That sound you hear as you walk to work? 
 It's the sidewalk melting the soles of your shoes. 
 Highs up to 94 today and no wind to save you. 
 _ 
 Let's hope it cools off tonight in time for baseball's exciting return to the city. 
 I don't know about you folks, but I could use a little break from the doom and gloom. 
 And maybe some late-inning heroics is just what Atlanta needs. 
 [Knocking] 
 I should mention, of course, that they'll be playing in honor of those still stuck inside the cordon. 
 They're not gonna let us leave. 
 T, I know you don't want to give birth in a gang-run grocery store. 
 If it has air conditioning, and ice cream. 
 And someone who could get us sick? 
 [Sigh] You don't know Jojo's sick. 
 I know he sneezed, then went in that storeroom and didn't come out. 
 That's not a coincidence. 
 Then feel free to find your escape. 
 Until then, earn your keep. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Sneezes, coughs] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey. Cannerts didn't catch you snooping around, did he? 
 No. No, but you know that guy who died before Sayid? 
 The one with Dr. Sanders? 
 Her boyfriend. 
 Yeah, well, I figured I could go check the stuff I stored with his remains. 
 Katie, someone's here. Says they want to talk to you. 
 Just ashes. No personal effects. 
 His body came in at the same time as Sanders, but he didn't have any stuff on him. No wallet, no phone. 
 It's like they didn't want anyone to know who he was. 
 Well, that's not suspicious. 
 [Beep] 
 [Door opens] 
 [People coughing] 
 I asked Lex to find the hospital security video you wanted. 
 I'm hoping it'll show us if the guy was with Sanders that morning before she saw Sayid. 
 If that's the case, then one of them could be our real patient zero. 
 It's so gross they would pin it on a Middle Eastern guy. 
 Yeah, but also, but also, why pin it on him? 
 Why lie about patient zero at all? 
 Girl : Miss Katie? 
 Woman : She came in this morning. 
 Says you know her little brother Thomas. 
 Thomas? Yeah. He's my student. 
 Went home with his dad. 
 My dad's dead. 
 And I started coughing, so, I just... I ran. 
 I didn't want to get him sick. 
 But now, he's out there alone. 
 You can find him, right? 
 Of course. 
 [Coughs] 
 Of course. Yes. We'll find him. 
 You did the right thing, OK? 
 [Coughing] 
 Jake : I can head out in a few minutes. 
 I was going on patrol anyway. 
 Good. We can go together. 
 [Girl coughing] 
 Man : Gonna tell me why I'm printing you out a two-month-old warrant? 
 Something came up. 
 I just wanted to take a look at the security video. 
 Of some kid jacking a few candy bars from the hospital gift shop? 
 Is that a problem? 
 It's expired. 
 Yeah, well, it's two months old. 
 Thank you. 
 Major Carnahan. 
 Any chance you were at roll call this morning? 
 No, sir. I gave that to Walden. 
 Who wasn't there, either. In fact, most of your guys called in sick. 
 Think maybe it's just too hot outside? 
 I know they were mad about what happened to Meese... 
 You left one of their own to fend for himself inside the cordon. 
 I had to do that, sir. 
 I know you did. That was your job. 
 But now they're not doing theirs. 
 Sir, I'll find a way to cover. 
 We'll be lucky if we can cover our own asses now. 
 Dr. Lommers just called from Washington. 
 National Guard's on their way. 
 Food drop failed, so they're bringing in the big guns before they try another one. 
 But it failed because of her. 
 I mean, she rushed the timeline. 
 You really think that matters? 
 You really do. 
 This isn't about fairness, it's about playing the game. 
 Keep refusing, you're gonna lose a lot more than access to the cordon. 
 Sir, I have to meet with Jake later. 
 Why? 
 He's low on ammo. 
 Well, then you better get it done before they get here. 
 You ain't seen red tape until you've seen what it's like with the Guard in charge. 
 Man on TV : It's necessary. 
 Woman on TV : It's callous. 
 No, it's absolutely necessary when we are challenged as a nation, when we are potentially under attack, to maintain a sense of who we are. 
 And you think that the game of baseball... 
 No, no, no, not just a game. 
 A national pastime, a tradition that has remained the same for over a century. 
 And today, it can be our statement to the world that we are the same great nation that we were 9 days ago. 
 And for that, you'd shove 50,000 people into a tight space just steps away from a quarantine zone. 
 There is no danger outside the cordon, and frankly, it's criminal to suggest otherwise. 
 It's criminal to start selling hot dogs while 4,000 Americans can't leave their homes. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 It's now or never. 
 Teresa : Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 He's sick. 
 Your boy Jojo. 
 He's sick in that storeroom. 
 And I get why you're avoiding it, I do, but he's gonna die. 
 And the only question is how many of us he takes with him. 
 You gotta make him leave. 
 Or at least let me and my girl go stay somewhere else. 
 Please. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Problem solved. Now get back to work. 
 Cannerts : I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. 
 Lommers : I recommend we institute a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. 
 Lex : What I need is the truth. 
 Jake : Yeah, I'm in the middle of the damn hot zone, Lex. 
 Jana! 
 Lex : If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. 
 We think it's getting worse. 
 Imagine what it's like in this tiny sealed room. 
 I'd suggest strip poker if I didn't think Tony would lose. 
 Seriously, why is it so hot up here? 
 Should we be worried? 
 Yes. With the A/C shorting out, you could blow a fuse, lose power completely. 
 So, what do we do? 
 We shut off the air on the other floors. 
 Ours might kick back in. 
 No way. You want to leave again? 
 Jana just got attacked down there. 
 The utility room's in the basement. 
 There's direct access from the first floor. 
 OK. Good. 
 And I've been checking the monitors. 
 The crazy guys in the garage seem to have left for now. 
 Why, thank you, neighborhood watch, but I don't think it's worth the risk. 
 It is, actually. 
 It's OK. I'll go. 
 Suzy : Jana... 
 Jana : Safer if there's two of us. 
 No. 
 Buzz us out. 
 Sooz... 
 [Beep] 
 [Elevator dings] 
 My boyfriend's a cop. 
 You never leave a man behind. 
 Man on TV : In turbulent times, when tensions with the Middle East are at a peak... 
 [Knocking] 
 Leo : What? 
 Man on TV : Atlanta is making a case for baseball, and that... 
 Perfect timing. They're just about to discuss the baseball game for the 27th time this morning. 
 Listen, you said that I should come to you when I was ready for the truth. 
 So, I'm here and you're... hungover. 
 Strictly speaking, I would classify this as more drunk than hungover. 
 Man on TV : ...baseball going, and that's exactly what Atlanta... 
 Had a cop at the hospital who thinks that they've been lying to us about patient zero. 
 Might not be the Syrian. 
 Could be a cover-up. 
 Now, we just need to get the tape of the hospital's security feed... 
 Are you even listening? 
 I killed them. 
 What are you talking about? 
 My friends. 
 I asked them to explore the cordon, to get video for me. 
 "Feed the beast," I said. 
 I risked their lives so I could get a scoop. 
 I'm the beast. 
 Not if you make sure it wasn't for nothing. 
 There are some powerful people that control the fate of everyone inside the cordon. 
 Now, from the very beginning, you believed that they were lying to us. 
 What if we can prove that you were right? 
 Save innocent lives. 
 Fine. 
 At least change out of that bathrobe. 
 Making me sad. 
 What do you even need me for, anyway? 
 You're a cop who wants security video. 
 So, you just walk into that big data center off the highway, show them a warrant, and get whatever you want. 
 Yeah, if I want Lommers to know exactly what I'm into. 
 I thought about using this warrant for an old case at the hospital. 
 That would get me in with a legit reason. 
 Then I could watch the footage that I wanted. 
 But it's expired. 
 You gotta forge it, man. 
 You gotta change the date or the judge's signature, whatever. 
 That would be a felony. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 I want to know how you would do it. 
 You upload security video... 
 I see. OK, so, you come to me so I can get my hands dirty but you, Major Carnahan, you want to stay clean. 
 You want to play hero... 
 I want to find out the truth. 
 And that's what you do, right? 
 This could be the biggest story of your life, Leo. 
 So, you can stay on that couch, or you can take your head out your ass, honor your friends, and maybe get a Pulitzer. 
 It's your choice. 
 The second option does sound more appealing. 
 You got two minutes to change. 
 3 if you burn that bathrobe. 
 Hey. Hey. I talked to Ray, the bus driver. 
 He's gonna watch Quentin and I've got protective gear, so, we should be all set, right? 
 Yeah, sure, if you were going. 
 I am going. I'm an adult. 
 I can make that decision myself. 
 And I'm a cop. 
 This is my job, not yours. 
 He's my student, my responsibility. 
 And I already lost track of him once. 
 I owe it to his dad to... 
 It's been hard to keep up. 
 This is what it's like outside. 
 Then we're gonna need protection. 
 Hey. 
 Doesn't matter how hot it gets out there. 
 You keep this on. 
 Yeah, yeah. We'll be there. Mm-hmm. 
 My guy's at the data center now, but he's only gonna be there another 20 minutes. 
 He got tickets to the damn baseball game, if you can believe it. 
 And this guy just lets you in. 
 No badge, no warrant, nothing. 
 He's my guy. 
 Do you really want to know what that entails? 
 No. I don't. 
 Woman on police radio : Please respond. 
 [Static] 
 All units, we've got a Signal 7 at the corner of Courtland and Baker. 
 All units, please respond. 
 Don't even think about it. I just told you we've got 20 minutes. 
 I heard what you said, but I'm down on men. 
 We're only a block away. 
 Can't ignore this unless... 
 You have to ignore it or we miss our window. 
 No kidding. 
 Got the National Guard showing up tonight. 
 God knows what access I'm gonna lose. 
 Then let someone else handle the damn call. 
 Woman on police radio : All units, we've got a Signal 7 at the corner of Courtland and Baker. 
 All units, please respond. 
 This is Unit 16 responding. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Unbelievable. 
 [Scoffs] You have to be kidding me. 
 Lex : Shut up and let me do my job. 
 If we're not out of here in 10 minutes, my guy's gonna leave. Understand? 
 Morning, sir. 
 Man : Officer? 
 Lex : It's Major, actually. 
 And you got stuck with squatter duty? 
 The short version is, all the cops hate him. 
 Sir, could you tell me your name? 
 Figured the demo guys downstairs would've done all that. 
 Oh, they called you a name. Couple, actually. 
 Yeah. They were pretty pissed. 
 Sir. 
 Man : Hank. 
 Lex : Hank. 
 As you know, this building was set for demolition at 9 this morning, which means you're putting everyone behind schedule, including me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, you seem like a nice guy, so, I'm just gonna tell you right now. 
 I'm not leaving. 
 You are free to carry on with your day. 
 See, now my day involves arresting you, and that's not just because you're messing with me. 
 You're messing with public safety. 
 Oh, come on. 
 This building is unsafe. It was condemned weeks ago. 
 And yet at the moment, you'd think Atlanta might have more important issues to contend with. 
 The whole city can't stop running because of the cordon. 
 I've heard the talking points. 
 You and me both. 
 7 minutes. 
 [Cocks gun] 
 I said I wasn't leaving. 
 [Tape ripping] 
 You can't still think we're safe here. 
 I know you can't. 
 Man : Hey! 
 Just 'cause your hands are up don't mean I won't shoot. 
 You won't shoot because I'm not a cop. 
 I was, man, but not in here. 
 Trey : Maybe you should go not be a cop somewhere else. 
 Actually, I was thinking, uh, might join your operation. 
 I mean, I'm stuck in here, I might as well make a buck, right? 
 Why would we let you do that? 
 Because... 
 I've got the only open line of communication in the cordon. 
 How much would that be worth to you? 
 What's to keep me from killing you and just taking the phone? 
 My boss calls me to check in every day. 
 I don't answer, phone gets cut off. 
 It only works if I do. 
 [Laughs] 
 Welcome to the Old Fourth Lords. 
 [Trey laughs] 
 Jana : You think this was the guys in the garage? 
 Sam : Most likely. 
 Tweaked out, enjoying the chaos. 
 They're gone, though, remember? 
 [Exhales] 
 So, you do data recovery, right? 
 You been doing that for long? 
 How do you like it? 
 We have to almost be there, right? 
 Utility room is just down this way. 
 Andy Warhol, cordon style. 
 Maybe we should stock up on some food while we're here. 
 [Gasps, pants] 
 Ohh. 
 
 
 
 Jake : He's not in here. 
 He's dead, isn't he? 
 Thomas? You don't know that. 
 He did this, Jake. 
 He cared for his dad, he moved his body. 
 If he's not dead, he's somewhere dying. 
 Boy : Don't say that, Mom. 
 Quentin? 
 Lex : I know you think that we're at an impasse, but if I can... 
 No. I have the power and I am not leaving. 
 I was actually hoping to apologize. 
 Shouldn't have rushed you. That was my fault. 
 I wasn't having a great day, I had this guy rushing me, and I put it on you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 So, here is my gesture of good faith. 
 I'm still not leaving. 
 I know. 
 I just thought maybe you could tell me why. 
 Can you believe they're playing baseball today? 
 First game back since it happened. 
 I heard that. 
 The big return to normalcy. 
 Do things seem normal to you? 
 No. 
 They really don't. 
 Lex. 
 I take it you don't like baseball. 
 Slowest game on God's green Earth. 
 Lex. 
 Can you give me a... give me a second, please. 
 Ow. 
 I swear to God, Leo, if you so much as... 
 Are you threatening me again? 
 You know, I didn't ask you to come to my apartment this morning, but you did. 
 And you promised me the truth, or at least some attempt to find it, not whatever the hell this is. 
 This is somebody with a gun. 
 And as a cop, I take that pretty seriously. 
 It takes time. You can't rush a gun out of a man's hand. 
 So, give me a few more minutes... 
 No, see, no more minutes. 
 My guy's gone. 
 But otherwise, really top-notch police work. 
 It's been fun. 
 Let's never do it again. 
 I don't know how you... 
 God, I don't even want to think about how you got here on your own. 
 You shouldn't have done that. 
 He's my friend, Mom. And you said he was lost. 
 Katie : It doesn't matter. I tell you to do something, it is to keep you safe. You know our rules. 
 Our rules? We live in a hospital, and there's a dead guy on the floor in there. 
 [Sigh] 
 I'm still your mother, no matter where we are or what it looks like, and will always be you mother, OK? 
 You guys can head back to the hospital. 
 I promise I'll keep looking for Thomas. 
 Quentin : No. 
 Katie : Honey. 
 I know where he is. 
 What do you mean? 
 His batting helmet. That's where it goes. 
 So? 
 So, that means I know where he is. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Clatter] 
 Hey! 
 I'm telling you, that boy is nothing but trouble. 
 It's fine. I'll deal with it. 
 In two minutes, walk left down this aisle, hug the wall, and go out the back door. 
 I'll have everyone facing me. 
 Mom, I... 
 As many supplies as I could get. 
 You know where we're going? 
 I'll follow as soon as I can. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Leanne : So, go. 
 Come on. Come on, T. 
 OK. 
 When were you gonna tell me you live inside the cordon? 
 What? 
 You keep looking out the window at that apartment building across the way. 
 It's yours, isn't it? 
 When I'm standing up, if I turn my head just right, I can see right onto my terrace. 
 They're gonna tear down this building, Hank. 
 They won't do it with you in it, but they'll do it eventually. 
 You'll get tired, and hungry, and someone will arrest you. 
 And instead of being there for whoever's inside that apartment, you'll be in jail. 
 It's not much of a terrace. 
 It's really a... fire escape with some potted plants. 
 City life, right? 
 Right. 
 On days like this, we'd sit out there with some iced tea... just me and my daughter. 
 You got kids? 
 No. 
 I just got her, and she just got me. 
 And that's always been enough. 
 But now... now she's alone. 
 And we haven't been able to talk since you guys made everything go dark. 
 But at least up here, [Sniffles] 
 I can see her on that terrace. 
 She doesn't know it, of course. 
 But she still comes out and sits there every morning. 
 And I can see her. 
 I get it. I do. 
 I got someone in there, too. 
 When this is all over... 
 It's been two days. 
 What? 
 She hasn't been out in two days. 
 Well, with this heat, could you blame her? 
 Just because you haven't seen her, that doesn't mean... 
 You know exactly what that means. 
 I know you're probably gonna tell me that me being up here, being able to look in, has absolutely no effect on whether she's still alive. 
 No. It doesn't. But you know what? 
 If I had a window like that, I'd be up here, too. 
 [Whirring] 
 See? 
 Jake : Well, he was right. 
 God, it's miserable out here. [Sigh] 
 I like it. 
 Reminds me of the good, old days. 
 District champs. 
 Of course you were. 
 [Engine revving] 
 What? What is that? 
 Yeah-ha-ha-ha! 
 Katie : Quentin, run. 
 Quentin : What? 
 No, now. 
 Man : Yeah! Run, little [Indistinct]! 
 [Men whistling, cheering] 
 Man : Ha ha ha! [Indistinct]! Come on, guys! 
 Man : Whoo! How you doing'?! Ha ha! 
 Katie : [Screams] No! 
 Katie : Jake. 
 Man : Hey. 
 Katie : Oh! 
 Man : Go! 
 Uhh. 
 Man : Let's go, let's go! Run! 
 You shot him. 
 Not as many times as I wanted. 
 What do you think they wanted? 
 They're high off their asses. They don't know what they want. 
 Quentin. 
 Quentin? 
 [Phone chimes] 
 _ 
 [Beep] 
 You said you like iced tea, right? 
 What? 
 It'll be cold. That's all that matters. 
 And sandwiches. 
 God knows how long we've been up here. 
 Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm starving, actually. 
 OK, then. 
 I'll be right back. 
 So, you came back. 
 Yeah, I realized something. 
 You're a cop. 
 And you're slower than I thought. 
 No, you're a cop, which means you couldn't not come up here. 
 And I'm a journalist, and you gave me a story. 
 Now I can't shake it. 
 So, what's the new plan? 
 You're not gonna like it. 
 It's a fake. 
 You forged the warrant. 
 I said you wouldn't like it. 
 You were wrong. Let's go. 
 Are you serious? 
 I am tired of meeting people who are willing to fight harder than I am. 
 [Beeping] 
 Just tell me you're almost done. 
 Sam : HVAC motherboards require a little patience. 
 They're not coming back. 
 And they're not in the garage. We'd hear them. 
 They killed that guy. For what? 
 I think I knew him. I mean, I recognized him. 
 I'd always pass him in the lobby by the coffee stand. 
 Yeah. Chuck. 
 You knew him? 
 Just from the lobby like you. 
 He's got a couple kids. 
 I'm trying to remember his wife's name. 
 Mia, I think. Works at Emory. 
 When this is over, I should look her up. 
 I meant to tell her about her husband, not to, like, look her up. 
 Yeah, I know what you meant. 
 If for no other reason than my boyfriend wouldn't like it. 
 He's on the outside, like yours. 
 How do you do that? 
 What? 
 If all you ever did was see the guy in the lobby, how do you know all that stuff about him? 
 Um... I don't know exactly. 
 He was wearing a gym T-shirt one day of this band I liked, so, we just started talking about that. 
 He and his wife had been to the concert. 
 Just normal stuff. 
 Not for me. 
 What do you mean? 
 I'm just not any good at it. 
 Being that friendly with strangers. 
 Being open with anyone. 
 Why is that, do you think? 
 The answer probably involves the phrase "rough childhood." 
 And with your boyfriend? 
 With him, I'm... working on it. 
 That's all anyone can ask, right? 
 It's funny... the second we can't speak to each other, suddenly there's all this stuff I want to say. 
 It just takes practice. 
 With him, with strangers. 
 You put a little of yourself out there, you get a little back. 
 So, Jana, you do data recovery, right? 
 How do you like it? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Uhh. 
 [Whirring] 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. Quentin, where are you! 
 Where is he? 
 Quentin! 
 Jake, where is he? They must have got him. 
 Quentin! 
 Katie : Quentin? 
 Mom. 
 I'm not supposed to touch. 
 Katie. 
 If you were sick, I'd want to be sick, too. 
 Mom. 
 Thomas, no. 
 Don't worry. 
 I don't get sick. 
 Man on radio : Gordon from a stretch. 
 Looks to first and set. The 1-0 pitch from [Indistinct]... 
 Lex : How's the big game going? 
 Who cares? 
 Tell me you got the hospital footage. 
 Hot damn. 
 You know, whoever you got to forge that warrant, I should really arrest them. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [Beep] 
 It's corrupted. 
 That's convenient. 
 No kidding. 
 Whatever it is they're trying to hide, they're doing a pretty good job of it. 
 All right. 
 We'll find a guy to uncorrupt it. 
 Yeah. But it's not a guy. 
 I know the best in the business. 
 [Elevator dings] 
 [Sighs, laughs] 
 Was it foolish to think we'd be welcomed back as conquering heroes? 
 Cool air is its own reward. Guys? 
 We got visitors. 
 Sam : Crazy ones? 
 Dennis : Pregnant ones. 
 He's back. 
 Sam : You know them? 
 Yeah, the guy came by a few days ago. 
 Helped me get a message out to my boyfriend. 
 Sam : That was nice. 
 Jana : Yeah, it was. 
 Let them up. 
 You can't be serious. 
 Of course I am. The girl looks 10 months pregnant. 
 So? We can't just take in every pathetic straggler that shows up. 
 There's probably 100 pregnant girls out there right now. 
 But there's only one on our doorstep. 
 No. 
 Man : ♪ Every night... ♪ 
 I'm sorry. No. 
 Man : ♪ Let me come over, I can waste your time... ♪ 
 [Sam chuckles] 
 Man : ♪ Invite me to the war every night of the summer ♪ 
♪ And we'll play G.I. blood ♪ 
 This way, sir. 
 Man : ♪ G.I. blood ♪ 
 He sure looks healthy. 
 [Door closes] 
 You think he's gonna get sick. 
 I think he's a kid. He can't possibly know. 
 Yeah, but think about how many sick people he's touched. 
 His dad and the janitor before that. He should be dead, but look at him. 
 And... and Cannerts said when I asked him about a vaccine? 
 He said, until he finds someone who's immune, he's flying blind. 
 Maybe now he'll be able to cure this thing.
