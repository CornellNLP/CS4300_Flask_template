 It is nothing to get worked up about. 
 On the day you're supposed to move in with me? 
 I know. 
 You're not even done unpacking yet. 
 Teresa, you have your appointment at the adoption agency. 
 We are gonna make this work. 
 Katie : Everybody, remember. 
 We are here to help sick people feel better. 
 I was gonna meet Dr. Sanders. She was gonna take them on a tour. 
 You understand the precautions we need to take, Dr. Sanders? 
 I... I just started rounds. 
 The first patient was a Syrian kid. 
 Lex : So, what's going on? 
 Possible flu outbreak. 
 Sabine Lommers. Health and Human Services. 
 Dr. Cannerts has identified a possible public health threat. 
 And there's a Syrian kid who needs to be picked up for questioning. 
 Jake, you'll run point. 
 Think it would be wise if you stayed here a while. 
 They're officially putting the hospital on lockdown. 
 I've got 14 kids here. 
 I feel like I should know if it's bad. 
 At 1629, Patient Zero was pronounced dead. 
 And the faster we can initiate contact tracing, the faster we can contain this outbreak. 
 Lommers : This is now a matter of national security. 
 As such, I recommend that we institute top-level containment measures to protect the citizens of this city. 
 No, screw you, Lex. 
 You're the one who sent me in here. 
 Jake! 
 Lex : I can't let you through there. I'm sorry. 
 My girl is in there. 
 So is mine. 
 Lommers : Once we're 48 hours disease-free, our lives can go back to normal and this will be over before it begins. 
 Continuing the post mortem of Sayid Nassir, age 22. 
 Preliminary cause of death believed to be a result of infection by a genetically altered form of H7N2 influenza. 
 The virus has been engineered to express a filovirus protein, explaining its hemorrhagic presentation. 
 I'll begin the internal examination. 
 I've examined the organs in situ in the rib cage... 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 I understand your concerns, but if the professionals in this room are panicking, how am I supposed to get the rest of the country to stay calm? 
 Not to mention the citizens who have been quarantined within the boundaries of the cordon sanitaire? 
 Woman on TV : ...have been exposed and possibly infected by the deadly virus. 
 Lommers : The people will get their news from the press. 
 The press will get their news from us. 
 Right now, convincing the people inside the cordon to follow the rules is what's separating them from mass exposure to the virus. 
 Cannerts : Bile in the liver is to be expected. 
 Once I remove the stomach... 
 Lommers : We're less than an hour in, so, let me be clear. 
 There is currently no vaccine, there is no cure, and it has thus far proven to have a mortality rate of 100%. 
 The only thing keeping the rest of us safe is if we ensure that the virus stays within the boundaries of the cordon. 
 Man : Excuse me, ma'am. What will happen if the virus is found outside the cordon? 
 We believe that contact tracing has isolated all known carriers of the virus and thankfully, all those people have been contained. 
 OK. Let's continue with the round-up. Chief Besser? 
 Besser : Over here. 
 The electric fences are being activated around the perimeter. 
 Officers from all zones have been brought in for crowd control. 
 We've asked for additional support on the ground from outlying counties and people are asking me if there'll be any military involvement. 
 If we handle this properly, we won't need them. 
 Where's FEMA? 
 Cannerts : Pulmonary sac is filled with blood, likely leading to severe cardiogenic shock. 
 Complete necrosis of the kidney. 
 Eyes and skin are jaundiced. 
 The lungs indicate severe pulmonary congestion. 
 Bilaterally, pleurae has adhesions. 
 The condition of the liver suggests autolysis. 
 Indicators show blood clotting has been significantly inhibited. 
 Spleen is engorged. 
 [gasping] 
 All evidence indicates that the timeframe from exposure to expiration is under 48 hours. 
 Cannerts : I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. 
 Lommers : I recommend we institute a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. 
 Lex : What I need is the truth. 
 Jake : Yeah, I'm in the middle of the damn hot zone, Lex. 
 Jana! 
 Lex : If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. 
 Woman : The situation is chaotic at best, as thousands have been displaced from their homes and separated from loved ones. 
 I'm standing here in the 500 Block of Spring Street, at the outer edge of the cordon's perimeter. 
 We'll be reporting to you live as the situation develops. 
 I'm Lindsay Savage. 
 I understand your concerns about your pets, but is there anybody that you can call? 
 Any... Sir, I need you to back away from that fence. 
 It has an electrical... Sir! 
 Sir, the point of this fence is for your safety. 
 OK? Do not tempt fate. 
 ...please. Please. 
 Follow the rules, all right? 
 Keep 4 to 6 feet apart. 
 Stay inside. It's for your own good. 
 Man : You'll be all right, baby. 
 Hey, media stays behind the line. 
 Man : Officer, can I have your name, please? 
 It's Major. I'm a little busy here. 
 Leo Green. intheperimeter.com. 
 That's very nice, but as you can see, media relations is not my top priority at this exact moment. 
 ...I'm about to make you a national hero. 
 Shot this an hour ago. 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Cop saves black kid from white brutality. 
 That is good stuff. Care to comment? 
 I'm a little bit more concerned about the safety of all these people. 
 So, why don't you step back behind the media line before I'm forced to arrest you. 
 [telephone ringing] 
 [beep] 
 Hey. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm at my office. I got turned away at Spring. 
 What's going on? 
 It's bad, baby. 
 They've quarantined a 4-square-mile of the city. 
 Oh, my... Are you all right? 
 Wait, which section? Where are you? 
 I tried to call you to make sure that you got out in time. 
 Wait, Lex, I don't... 
 My section? 
 It's... it's gonna be OK. 
 They're saying it's just 48 hours. 
 Turn on the news. They're broadcasting all the rules that you need to follow. 
 It's not airborne. It can only be spread through bodily fluids. 
 Sweat, blood, stuff like that. 
 And Jake's in there, too, so if you need anything, you call him, OK? 
 But your office is probably the safest place that you can be right now. 
 Yeah, OK, I'll stay in the cleaning room. It's all sanitized. 
 I'll come to get you as soon as I can. 
 47 hours at the most. 
 Whatever you do, you stay safe, OK? 
 I love you. 
 Jana : I will. 
 Woman on TV : People are strongly encouraged... 
 I love you, too. 
 Woman on TV : ...And practice what they're calling Social Distance by remaining 4 to 6 feet apart. 
 Man on TV : The Atlanta Police Department and the City... 
 [telephone ringing] 
 [beeping] 
 [buzzing] 
 Whoever that is must've really done you wrong. 
 Why do you say that? 
 We're in the hot zone of an outbreak. 
 Most people would answer a phone call. 
 It was just work. 
 So you're dodging calls from the police? 
 I think I'm officially on holiday. 
 Quentin : Mom? 
 Yeah, sweetie? 
 Quentin : I can't sleep. 
 Let me see your hands. 
 That's not 4 to 6 feet. 
 We'll make an exception just this once. 
 What do we say when we're home? 
 There are no monsters under the bed. 
 No monsters in your head. 
 Tomorrow brings new day of light. 
 Sweet dreams, my prince. Good night. 
 Man on P.A. : 4 to 6 feet away from each other. 
 It is imperative that you stay inside and remain in full quarantine. 
 Woman on TV : The video posted earlier this evening on Leo Greene's blog in the perimeter shows... 
 You're famous. 
 I'd rather be inside with you. 
 Better you're not. It's like Black Friday in here. 
 My mom's being as classy as always. 
 She already jacked up the prices. 
 She give you any trouble for trying to run off with me? 
 I don't know if she noticed. 
 I walked right in earlier with my suitcase and she didn't say a word. 
 How's our baby? 
 Cool as a cucumber. 
 I wish I could say the same. 
 Little worried about giving birth in the middle of Contagion City. 
 It's only two days. 
 And we can talk every hour on the hour. 
 Sounds good. Mm. Gotta go. Aimee's calling. 
 Is she inside? 
 I'll have to find out. Love you. 
 Xander : Love you, too. 
 Teresa : Hi. 
 Teresa, oh, my God, where are you? 
 At the store. I didn't make it out. 
 [music playing behind Aimee] 
 Apparently, you did. 
 No, dude, I'm at Toby's. 
 His parents didn't make it through before the fences went up, so we're raiding the liquor stash. Get over here. 
 You do realize we're in the middle of a possible terrorist attack. 
 Live fast, die young. Come on over. Mwah! 
 Bye. 
 [beep] 
 [sigh] 
 [siren wailing] 
 [knocking on window] 
 Damn! Suzy, what the... 
 Sorry. Just let us in, OK? Dennis has to pee. 
 [beep] 
 [Suzy giggling] 
 Bathroom. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Why aren't you home, 10 miles away from all this mess? 
 I got stuck at happy hour with Dennis. 
 We left to get the MARTA home, but no MARTA, no home, so. 
 I guess now we're stuck in here with you. 
 I love you. I'm pissed you're here. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm following the rules and going to bed. 
 And so should you. 
 Alone. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Hard at work, gentlemen? Ladies. 
 Hey, hero. Boys, make way for our very own big hero Major Carnahan. 
 Lex : I don't need to remind you that that was you pinning that kid on the street. 
 It's not like I shot him. 
 You're a real gift to society. You know that, Walden? 
 Listen. That video is an example of what we're up against here. 
 The eyes of the world are on us. 
 Which means there is no room for error. 
 If the public don't trust us, they don't listen to us, and if they don't listen to us, people end up dead. 
 Now, there are 4,000 innocent lives being held inside those gates, and their one goal is to stay healthy. 
 Our one goal... make sure those gates hold. 
 Because if they don't, every person in this city is at risk of exposure. 
 And once that virus is out, it is out. 
 You hear me? 
 All : Yes, sir. 
 [gasping] 
 Quarantine. Does anyone know what this means? 
 It's like a snow day for sick people. 
 [laughter] 
 I can always count on you for answers, Thomas. Mary. 
 It's an isolation period for anyone who's been exposed to a disease. 
 Katie : Exactly. People in this hospital have been exposed to a flu that the doctors can't fix yet. 
 They don't want anyone to leave until they know we're not sick, either. 
 Is that why Britney went away? 
 Britney is fine, Quentin. 
 Her mom's boyfriend is with her. 
 When will our parents get here? 
 When the quarantine is over. 
 Then we'll all be sent home. 
 Katie : Yes, Bert. 
 My wife Micheline is home alone. 
 Who decides when we get to leave? 
 That's a good question. 
 I will have to get back to you on that. 
 Man on TV : Showing us that even as the city is torn apart by this volatile situation, there is always room for a hero. 
 Nice piece. 
 Just a hack blogger looking for an angle. 
 Still, it is why I hand-picked you to be the representative for the Atlanta P.D. 
 You're a good guy. A good face. 
 People need someone to believe in in times like this. 
 This is not a bad thing. 
 I am concerned, however, about your girlfriend. 
 What's her name? 
 It's Jana. 
 Jana's inside the cordon? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Your best friend on the force? 
 Officer Jake Riley? Also inside? 
 Is that going to be a problem? 
 In what way? 
 Upholding the boundaries of the cordon is paramount to containing this virus. 
 No one gets in, no one gets out. 
 So, if your personal attachments lead to any rules being compromised, any special treatment... 
 I know what my duty is to this city. 
 That's what I told the others. 
 Ahem. Dr. Cannerts. 
 I'd like you to meet Major Carnahan from Zone 6. 
 He's running point from the outside. 
 Major, Dr. Cannerts is from the CDC. 
 He's on the ground inside the cordon with the exposed patients at Atlanta Midtown Hospital. 
 I wish we were meeting under better circumstances. 
 How many patients do you have under lockdown? 
 The 5 family members of Patient Zero, two doctors, two nurses, and a currently asymptomatic 11-year-old who may have just had a bout with allergies. 
 Your friend Officer Riley, he was not among the sick. 
 I wasn't... 
 It's OK, Lex. 
 One of the benefits of having this kind of access is information. 
 Cannerts : He is here at the hospital. 
 We're holding civilians in an old storage wing. 
 He'll be safe. 
 I appreciate the update. Thank you. 
 [telephone buzzing] 
 [children chattering indistinctly] 
 Katie : Guys, seriously? I said walk. 
 No worries, just some innocent kids running around a creepy hospital. 
 I got this one. You seem super busy. 
 Need some help? 
 Too little, too late, Jake Riley. 
 Cannerts : Officer. 
 Your friend Major Carnahan said you might be of some assistance. 
 Oh, did he? 
 [bouncing ball] 
 Tony forgot to do the shopping. 
 Tony's an idiot. How much is there? 
 Less than we need, and more than you and I have had in the past. 
 Group home rations. 
 My childhood is flashing before my eyes. 
 Yeah. Tell me about it. 
 Where's Dennis? 
 On the phone with his wife. 
 So, what does Lex have to say about all this? 
 He says if we follow the rules and stay isolated, we'll be fine. 
 Did he remind you that if you'd just moved in with him yesterday like you were supposed to, you'd be safe on the outside with your man right now? 
 Hey, if you'd gone home after work like you were supposed to instead of to happy hour with a married man, you wouldn't be here for me to worry about, either. 
 Yeah, well, then I'd just be home worrying about you, so, who wins, huh? 
 [Dennis sighs] 
 My daughter's pissed for missing her soccer game. 
 How do you explain to a 9-year-old that you're trapped inside a city? 
 There are worse things to explain to a 9-year-old. 
 OK. I divided everything we have into 3, based on a balanced caloric intake. 
 We have 30 hours left. 
 We eat on a schedule. Only what's allotted. 
 [knocking on window] 
 Man : Hey, y'all. 
 Jana : Tony. 
 I slept in the car. 
 You got anything to eat? 
 [beeping] 
 Jake, finally. What the hell, man? 
 Jake : You're volunteering me? 
 First you get me trapped in here, and now I get to play evidence clerk for the doctors? 
 Did you call me to yell at me? 
 Yeah. You got a problem with that? 
 Yeah. A hello would be nice. 
 No, you don't get a hello, all right? 
 You're... you're safe and sound outside those fences, and I'm stuck in this... this hospital of death looking for ways to contact next of kin. 
 Lex : Jana's inside too, Jake. 
 Where? 
 Work. 
 They have sanitized rooms there for the computers they fix. 
 Yeah, lucky her. 
 Me, I'm in the running to be a baby-sitter for a bunch of fifth-graders. 
 What, do you have kids in there with you? 
 Yeah. Field trip. Hey, listen. 
 The guy I brought in... Patient Zero. 
 His whole family's in here dying. 
 Right? It kind of makes you wonder what type of person would infect their whole family just to kill a bunch of Americans. 
 Damn it. 
 Lex : What's wrong? 
 I'm-I'm looking at this kid's phone. 
 The... the teenage son. 
 He's got some photos from when Patient Zero came to town 3 days ago, nice pictures of the family reunion. 
 And then a new picture with some random white girl who's not here in isolation. 
 The doctors missed someone. 
 [coughing] 
 [gasping] 
 Man : What do we do when they find her? 
 We scan the boy's yearbook, Facebook, facial recognition, social media. 
 We're uploading video surveillance images from his high school. 
 I've got someone dialing every number in his phone. 
 Her T-shirt. That's a coffee house in Little Five Points. 
 Got someone en route. 
 That's outside the cordon. 
 That doesn't mean she is. 
 Well, if she is, then she's infected. This whole city... 
 Let's not jump to any dangerous conclusions. 
 Lex : Look, we don't know that she's outside the cordon. 
 Let me and my team do our job. 
 What's her name? 
 Look at me. Hey! [knocking] Kid. 
 Woman : Hold up. Leave him alone. 
 What's her name? 
 You FBI, you Homeland Security with all your questions. 
 You're not gonna have nothing. 
 My family is innocent. 
 [speaking Arabic] 
 No, no, don't start. 
 All right? Your nephew brought this into the country and your son is responsible for spreading it. 
 [speaking Arabic] 
 Just tell me who the girl is! 
 We don't know her! [coughing] 
 [woman speaking Arabic] 
 He didn't tell us about her. 
 We wouldn't have approved. 
 [banging] 
 Honey. 
 When I say come to a party, I mean come to a party. 
 We're not supposed to touch. 
 Ha ha! Tell that to Toby. 
 I came to kidnap you. 
 If you're not gonna run away with Xander, then you can run away to Toby's with me. 
 The party's still going? 
 Yeah. You're missing out. 
 My mom'll never go for it. 
 Your mom's got dollar signs growing out of her head like devil horns. 
 She's busy. We'll sneak out back. 
 All our friends are there. 
 In a month, you're gonna be a mom and your life will be over anyway. 
 Live a little while you still can. 
 [telephone ringing] 
 I'll catch up with you. 
 [sigh] 
 
 
 
 [telephone ringing] 
 Mm! You're so boring! 
 [sigh] 
 [beep] 
 Hi, Grandpa. 
 Lex : Let me know when you get something. 
 Yeah. Bye. 
 You're my new stalker, aren't you? 
 I hear you're looking for a girl. 
 No comment. 
 A lot of people in danger if she's sick outside the cordon. 
 A lot of people in danger if she's sick, period. 
 How'd you know? 
 I still have connections in a lot of places from the days when people actually liked me. 
 You're welcome, by the way. 
 For the piece. 
 Oh, you think I'm looking for validation? 
 I'm just doing my job. 
 You know, I asked Public Health PR for a one-on-one with you and they said no. 
 But I don't really care because you're clearly just part of their machine, aren't you? 
 You go wherever they want you to go. 
 You say exactly what they want you to say. 
 Maybe they respect your policing. 
 Maybe what they really like is having a black man as their mouthpiece while they lay the blame at the feet of the Middle East. 
 So, last night I'm a hero but today, I'm the enemy. 
 No, last night I thought maybe you were one of the good guys. 
 Good guys get a lot of clicks in these situations. 
 Villains, too, but no, I've decided that you're not really good or bad. 
 I think you're just theirs. 
 And in my experience, where there's a mouthpiece, there's a secret. 
 My guy at Homeland tells me that Syria has denied any awareness of Sayid nassir. 
 Even ISIS won't take credit. 
 It's kind of hard to call this bioterrorism without any terrorists, don't you think? 
 Did anyone bring you into the loop on that? 
 [scoffs] Major Mouthpiece. 
 Major. 
 We've got an address for the blonde girl. 
 It's outside the cordon. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Sir, I'm Major Carnahan with the Atlanta P.D., Zone 6. 
 Is your daughter Elizabeth on the premises? 
 You don't know where she is? 
 No, sir. I was hoping you would help me out with that. 
 Well, we've tried to get through to the police, but all the circuits are overloaded, and my... my wife has been waiting in line at Zone 5 all day. 
 Why? 
 Because our daughter didn't come home last night. 
 Lex : Elizabeth Franklin, 15. 
 We've tracked all calls and texts until approximately 5:00 yesterday, before the fences went up. 
 At which point we must assume either a dead battery or a power-down of the phone. 
 Video surveillance picked her up from her last known location. 
 We're in the process of tracing her steps from there. 
 As of now, her movements have remained within the boundaries of the cordon. 
 Our men have been given a special alert with instruction not to approach her without protection. 
 There. That car. 
 Man : White Honda Civic. Georgia plate Apple Victor Baker, 5964. 
 Lex : Wherever the driver is, they're at risk, too. 
 They stopped. 
 That building. 
 That's Midtown. 8:34, after the fences went up. She's still inside the cordon. 
 [crowd sighing] 
 Lex : Keep your relief to yourself. 
 If she's infected, things inside are about to take a very bad turn. 
 Meese, I need real-time images. 
 I'm on it, Major. 
 Big brother is watching. 
 Times like this, aren't you glad? 
 It's up, Major. 
 The car's still there. 
 Keep watching from last night. 
 Tell me if that girl leaves that building. 
 Sir, we need to get a team in there now. 
 Lommers : Not from outside. 
 No one in, no one out. 
 Send your men from inside. 
 You're determined to get me killed in here, aren't you? 
 Lex : I know, I know. Take medical assistance with you. 
 Protect yourself. And Jake, we need to know if she's symptomatic. 
 I'm real psyched about this. Truly. 
 [beep] 
 Savage on TV : At approximately 4:30 P.M. yesterday, Sayid Nassir, the man believed to be patient zero, died at Atlanta Midtown Hospital. 
 Tragically, the physician who initially treated Nassir died shortly after that, along with another man who was in the hospital as well. 
 Their names have yet to be released. 
 Health officials remain deeply concerned... 
 Miss Frank. They said you wanted to see me. 
 It's Katie, please. 
 Sorry, I'm not being nosy. They told me to wait in here. 
 No problem. 
 I needed an office, so, they put me in here. 
 My students and the rest of us in the old wing, we were wondering, when the 48 hours is up, who has the authority to release us? 
 If we believe the danger is over, my associates at the CDC and I will make that call. 
 "If"? 
 When. 
 Dr. Cannerts... on the TV, it said that the Syrian man died before the other victims, but I saw their bodies in the old wing while the other man was still alive. 
 Everyone's immune system is different. 
 Mr. Nassir's body simply fought a longer battle. 
 Hmm. 
 28 hours and counting. 
 Guess we could get some work done. 
 McKinley Corp's hard drives need some love. 
 Yeah, I'll get right on that, Dennis. 
 Suzy : What did Lex do to piss off Leo Greene? 
 Jana : National hero or government stooge? Ouch. 
 Suzy : Yeah. Check it out. Leo's got someone on the inside getting video for him.

 Bert : I'm doing OK so far. 
 I'm helping this nice teacher look after her kids. 
 So, how are you holding up? 
 Micheline : Oh, I'm perfectly fine. 
 Can't tear my eyes from the news, though. 
 Bert : Don't open the door to anyone. 
 My secret lover the mailman will be sorely disappointed to be turned away. [chuckles] 
 You just be safe, my love... 
 Woman on TV : The virus is spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva and mucus. 
 If you believe you've been exposed, it is imperative you do not... [thump] .. come into contact with anyone. 
 Our doctors and nurses are conducting preliminary screening and will be with you as soon as possible. 
 Please be patient. 
 [continues indistinctly] 
 [clatter] 
 Woman on TV : ...Flu outbreak, please visit your local urgent care center... [thump] .. located inside the cordon. 
 You can... 
 [clattering] 
 [both gasp] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Grandma, holy crap. You scared me. 
 Teresa, I thought you were a zombie. [giggles] 
 Grandpa caught me just in time. 
 Aimee was trying to get me to go to a party and Mom's so slammed at the store, you wouldn't have had anyone to bring you l... 
 Woman on TV : We've been told by authorities that several teens found partying... 
 Micheline : Are you all right? 
 Woman on TV : ...located within the cordon have been... 
 Yeah, sorry. It's just... 
 Woman on TV : ...infected by the deadly virus. 
 The news. 
 It's horrible, isn't it? 
 Endless talk about snot and mucus and terrorists. 
 I remember smallpox, of course. 
 That was the thing. 
 And tuberculosis. 
 Did you know your actual grandfather spent a whole year in the sanitarium when we were children? 
 A year. 
 Lucky he eventually passed before Bert walked into my life or I'd have left a sick man for my new husband. [chuckles] 
 Woman on TV : ...should immediately be taken... 
 I, um, messed up the sandwich order. 
 I'll send Mom back with the new ones. 
 Oh, no, no, no. It's all right, honey. 
 I don't mind. Love you, Grandma. 
 [door closes] 
 Katie : Is that your wife? 
 Yeah. 30 years next month. 
 You got anybody outside you're worried about? 
 Just people I'm happy to dodge. 
 [telephone ringing] 
 Speak of the devil. 
 Do you mind? 
 [mouthing] No. 
 Hi, Grace. 
 No, no word. 
 No, like I said, there's nothing I could... 
 Yes, of course. 
 Quentin. 
 Grandma! 
 Yeah. I'm good. 
 Jake : Count has the party as high as 30. 
 Lex, I mean, they'd been playing Spin the Bottle in there. 
 There's no telling where these kids went. 
 I mean, who they came into contact with. 
 There's 4,000 people locked in the cordon. 
 This thing is out there, Lex. It's out. 
 Look, you won't believe the kind of high-tech tracking stuff they've got in here. 
 EIS is on it. They're gonna find the kids, then they'll trace the exposures, which will shut down the spread of the virus. 
 Yeah, and what if they can't? 
 I can't think like that right now, Jake, and you damn sure can't think like that, either. 
 Lommers : Major. 
 Gotta go. 
 Damn it! Damn it! 
 Aah! 
 Hey! 
 I got 11-year-olds in there holding it together better than you. 
 Rein it in. 
 Cannerts : I'm afraid GDPH has had 4 new calls about potentially symptomatic patients. 
 3 are students who were at that party. 
 One the driver of the vehicle in question. 
 That's in addition to the 3 students already targeted for isolation. 
 Lommers : And the original exposed? 
 Cannerts : The Syrian family has lost two of the 5, and of the others, only the fifth-grade girl remains healthy. 
 Lommers : Was she exposed? 
 If she's immune, that's a breakthrough. 
 Cannerts : I'm afraid it was merely hay fever, as her guardian suspected. 
 We'll release her to his custody at the end of the isolation period. 
 It won't be long now for the rest. 
 Man : ♪ I'll boil easier than you ♪ 
♪ Crush my bones into glue ♪ 
♪ I'm a go-getter ♪ 
♪ The system's in red ♪ 
♪ The room is inbred ♪ 
 Man in HAZMAT suit : Ma'am, this way. 
 Man : ♪ I'm a go-getter ♪ 
♪ Don't hold no harm ♪ 
 Toby : Sorry. I'm sorry, Aimee. 
 Man : ♪ Don't hold ♪ 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Man : ♪ Don't hold ♪ 
 Man in HAZMAT suit : It's for your own safety, ma'am. 
 [gasping] 
 Man : ♪ Don't hold ♪ 
 [screaming] 
 Man : ♪ Don't hold ♪ 
 We can't trace all these people. 
 Until the virus dies out, we can't break the cordon. 
 Yeah. OK, fine. 
 But how do we get the healthy people out? 
 We don't. 
 [sirens wailing, horns honking] 
 Tomorrow you can alert the parents who live within the cordon to come for their kids. 
 The quarantine is over? 
 The hospital lockdown is over. 
 City quarantine has been extended. 
 With the virus confirmed beyond these walls, they can't tell when we can end the cordon. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Where will you go? 
 Zone 6 has a small satellite office inside the cordon. 
 I can stay there. 
 Oh. Good. 
 And you? 
 My place is outside. 
 Quentin's grandparents, too. Plus, I have other kids who may be stuck here, so... 
 I guess this is home for a while. 
 Cannerts has my number if you run into any trouble. 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. OK. 
 [sigh] 
 I'm sorry about earlier. 
 Sometimes when I'm, uh, upset, I let anger get the best of me. 
 I know the type. 
 I had a kid with one. 
 Those kids, they'll be looking to you, you know? 
 They want to believe you can protect them. 
 You sound like my buddy Lex. 
 Always trying to make me a good guy no matter what I did to convince him otherwise. 
 Well. You take care. 
 [sighs] 
 [exhales] 
 [rattling] 
 I can stay. 
 Do you need help with the kids? 
 I'll stay. 
 I'm staying. 
 It's all over the Internet. All those sick kids. 
 Lex : You need to stop reading that stuff. 
 It's a bunch of conspiracy theories and unconfirmed gossip. 
 How much longer are they gonna extend the quarantine? 
 I don't know. 
 Not long, just... they just need to know for sure. 
 I'm so stupid. Suzy was right. 
 If I had just told my head to stop spinning yesterday and packed up that moving van. 
 But your spinning head is one of the things that I love most about you. 
 Don't lie. 
 It's top 10 at least. 
 You're still lying. 
 Jana, you understand there's some things about the cordon I'm not gonna be able to tell you. 
 Like what? 
 That doesn't mean I don't love you. 
 I'm just doing my job. 
 Like what, Lex? 
 I'll call you later. 
 [beep] 
 She's not gonna like what's about to happen. 
 No one is. 
 Man on P.A. : Call the Georgia Department of Public Health. 
 Do you know where Aimee got infected? 
 [voice shaking] I don't know anything. 
 She kissed me. 
 Did you see the news? 
 They're sick, Xander. 
 My friends. They're all gonna die. 
 What if I'm... 
 T, listen to me. You are gonna be OK. 
 All right? You stay locked up and you don't let anyone near you. 
 A-and, baby, you gotta try to stop crying. 
 I-if you cry, we won't be able to tell if your nose is running from the tears or from the plague. 
 [laughs] 
 Xander, the baby. 
 I'm coming in. 
 Those fences can't hold me. 
 What? No. 
 I'm not letting you go through this alone. 
 [beeping] 
 Wait. 
 Suzy : Thanks for letting me into the queen's private quarters. 
 I didn't mean to shut you out. I just... 
 Lex has me scared, OK? 
 I promise not to breathe on you. 
 Sooz, I'm glad you're here. 
 I mean, I'd rather you be on the outside, but if we're gonna be stuck... 
 I'm glad we're together. 
 Hey, we've been through hell together once already. 
 Second time'll be a breeze, right? 
 [clattering] 
 Where do you think my birth mother is right now? 
 [chuckles] 
 Uh, she's... staring down at us from the International Space Station, where she was sent to teach astronauts geo-physics. 
 Nice. 
 She's a smart cookie, my mama. 
 [clattering] 
 Where's mine? 
 Hmm? 
 Well, she's patient zero. 
 [laughs] 
 [bang] 
 What was that? 
 [people shouting at once] 
 Man on P.A. : Ladies and gentlemen. 
 Please back away from the fences. 
 I need your cooperation, please. 
 [sirens wailing, indistinct shouting] 
 [helicopter flying overhead] 
 [motors outside] 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Man : It's for your own protection, OK? 
 [indistinct] 
 Man : How many of those things they bringing in? 
 Second man : Enough to seal off 4,000 people. 
 How long? 
 Indefinitely. 
 Man : Ma'am, please stay back. 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Man : Temporary measure. Please cooperate.
