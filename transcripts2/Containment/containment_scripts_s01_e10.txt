 Lommers :  I've never seen anything like this virus before. 
 Thomas' cells contain the blueprint for a cure. 
 I need you to help me sneak him out of the Cordon. 
 I was wrong! If Thomas leaves the Cordon, the virus leaves with him. 
 Miss Katie! 
 You need to take him back! 
 Thomas is a carrier. 
 You'll be quarantined here for 48 hours. 
 Get out of my way. 
 (gun cocks) 
 Yeah, I'm inside. 
 There's a lot riding on this. 
 Be safe in there. 
 I've got the only open line of communication in the Cordon. 
 How much would that be worth to you? 
 I need to get back to my family. 
 Jana :  I'm sorry that he left, but that is what happens when you sleep  with married men. They leave, and you knew that. 
 I think I'm pregnant. 
 We have a situation. 
 I'm sending in a unit to subdue the crowd. 
 Negative. Under no circumstances are you to send in troops. 
 I don't need your permission. 
 Go! Go! Go! Come on now! 
 Hey. (grunts) 
 Help me. 
 I can't, Tee. 
 I bumped into someone. I might be infected. 
 Mary. 
 (tires screech) 
 Mary! 
 Where's Mary? 
 We had to leave her. 
 Britney : She got sick. 
 What do you mean, like sick-sick? 
 Put her down. 
 Please. Just put her down. 
 (static crackling) 
 They're only five minutes late. 
 (men shouting in distance) 
 The National Guard is never late. 
 (creaking) 
 What's the latest on the riot aftermath and the guardsmen in isolation? 
 I can't say, ma'am. 
 You can't say or you don't know? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe he's too low down the chain to know much. 
 Exactly. Which means either the situation is so bad they have all hands on deck or... 
 We're no longer important enough to deserve anyone higher. 
 A lot can change in two days. 
 There was a riot. We weren't in charge. 
 We lost control. 
 So we get it back. We change the script. 
 Right after we go home and take a shower. 
 I'll meet you at Joint Ops in an hour. 
 And, Major, the press will be all over this. 
 We need to be a united front. 
 We are. 
 (phone chimes) 
 (beeping) 
 (door opens) 
 I'm way better at that. 
 (chuckles) 
 These are special circumstances. 
 Yeah. 
 The stakes are high. You're nervous. 
 It's called being clutch, Katie. 
 Okay, the true mark of a good ballplayer is if they're clutch. 
 You know a lot of ballplayers in isolation rooms? 
 Only eight hours left. 
 I should be sick, Jake. 
 Holding Mary like that, I broke every single rule. 
 You were brave. 
 (scoffs) 
 You think the virus cares about that? 
 Okay, fine. You're right. 
 If Mary had been sick, you'd be sick. 
 But she obviously wasn't. 
 (beeping) 
 (door opens) 
 You see? 
 I told you. 
 No sneezes? 
 No sneezes. 
 Can I go visit Thomas? 
 Yeah. 
 (chuckles) 
 That's rough. 
 You're not even the most popular person in isolation. 
 I'm a mom. 
 I'm not in it for the popularity. 
 Jana : Positive. 
 (sighs) 
 (Tee groaning) 
 Tee. 
 (groaning, panting) 
 I think my water just broke. 
 (panting) 
 Cannerts :  I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims. 
 Lommers :  I recommend we institute  a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus. 
 Lex :  What I need is the truth. 
 Jake :  We are in the middle of the damn hot zone. (screams) 
 Lex : Jana!  If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Hey. Took you long enough. 
 Did you get my messages? 
 "Hey, Lex. Yo, it's good to see you. 
 You know, I'm really glad that you didn't die in quarantine." 
 It's Lommers. 
 The whole damn thing. It's Lommers. 
 The real Patient Zero, Henry Burns, the second he got sick, he made a telephone call. 
 The number was blocked, but I happen to know it went to Nantucket. 
 Lommers has a house in... 
 In Nantucket, I know. 
 You're me two days ago. 
 She knew the Syrian kid was innocent, man, but she got Cannerts to make him the villain anyway. 
 And that delivery notice that I found, the one that made us think that Cannerts sent the virus to Burns, my hacker says it's got electronic fingerprints all over it. 
 Meaning it's fake. She planted it. 
 She probably planted all the evidence I found at his apartment, too. 
 And you have proof that it was her? 
 I'm working on that part. 
 That's the part we need. 
 And the why. 
 Why go on TV and blame Syria? 
 Why risk a global war? It doesn't track, Leo. 
 I just spent two days with the woman, and I really believed... 
 You were becoming BFFs? 
 She's playing you. 
 This is everything I've got on Burns. 
 I figure if we dig deep enough, we'll find something. 
 Wait, what's that? 
 Well, if you remember, I couldn't find any job history on him, but one company... 
 No, I've seen that before. 
 In one of your videos on your blog. 
 Maybe the one at your friends' apartment when... 
 When they were dead. 
 (beep) 
 Where? 
 There. 
 (trilling) 
 (typing) 
 They were onto the exact same thing. 
 Which means they could have exactly what we're looking for. 
 How could I have missed this? I've seen it 100 times. 
 You were focused on your friends. 
 But I'm supposed to meet Lommers soon. 
 We'll figure this out. 
 We owe them. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Let's make her pay. 
 We will. 
 Xander :  She's been having contractions. 
 I think they're getting closer. 
 Okay. So, Teresa, we need to get you settled somewhere. 
 I think Clean Room Three is probably best. 
 You mean the place we got attacked? 
 Thanks, but I'm good right here. 
 100 people have walked over that floor. It is really not the best place to give birth. 
 We're in the middle of a viral outbreak. 
 There's no best place to give birth. 
 Sooz. 
 Teresa : No, she's right. 
 If I have to do this, I'm doing it with Xander. 
 If he's stuck, I'm stuck. 
 Baby, listen. 
 I am so sorry that I'm in here. 
 But you and I, we've got a lifetime together. 
 I promise you. 
 But right now, I need you to be safe. 
 For our daughter. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Yeah? 
 All right. 
 Come on, sweetheart. 
 All right. 
 You're touching her? 
 We're about to deliver a baby. 
 (groans) 
 I think not touching is out the window. 
 Suzy : No. No, Jana, this is crazy. We can't do this here. 
 None of us have any idea what we're doing. 
 Suzy, stop talking. 
 Kitchen, laundry, now. 
 All right, Sam, I need you to help Teresa into the clean room, and then come back and get whatever sheets and pillows you can find, or anything that might resemble those things. 
 No problem. 
 Don't you get sick while I'm having your baby. 
 That would really suck. 
 Woman : You need to let 'em out. 
 You need to let people know what's going on. 
 Same way you did them, same way you did the people in the back. 
 You sent my son into that hell and then you lock him in a tent?! 
 Officer : Ma'am, let's move... 
 Woman : No! 
 Officer : Ma'am, I'm sorry for the situation. 
 We'll try to get some information on your son... 
 Didn't think you'd make it. 
 With all these family members here, it's a madhouse. 
 They have every right to be mad. 
 It's been two days. 
 We should have an update on the guardsmen's condition by now. 
 I agree, but I can't reach Captain Scott. 
 No one's cells work by the wall, and I've got conflicting reports from two different doctors. 
 So what's our play? 
 Go there ourselves... see it firsthand. 
 Give these people the truth they deserve. 
 You seem surprised. 
 I guess I wasn't expecting transparency. 
 Some things are more important, like honoring the men we've lost. 
 Chief, I'd like you to stay here and wait for my call. 
 I'll need a sat phone out there. 
 Absolutely. Come with me. 
 (beeping) 
 (knocks on glass) 
 Hey. You're not gonna believe this. 
 So Lex said that there are these journalists inside the Cordon who might've been onto a conspiracy. 
 That means there could be a whole apartment full of evidence. 
 Against Cannerts? 
 No, against Dr. Lommers. 
 Lex said she's the mastermind. 
 Okay, but... Cannerts still lied about the timeline of Patient Zero. 
 Yeah, well, he'll be out soon, and we can ask him why. 
 I can ask him. 
 You can go check on that apartment. 
 (laughs) 
 Uh, I'm not going anywhere. 
 Okay? Not for another... seven hours and four minutes. 
 Are you crazy? I'm fine. 
 This is what we've been waiting for. 
 No, I'm sorry, I've been waiting for cold beers and a night out. 
 Though I'd be willing to compromise for whiskey and a night in, if that's what... 
 Don't do that. 
 You're not that guy you were pretending to be two weeks ago. 
 This matters and you know it. 
 You  matter. 
 Then listen to what I'm saying. 
 You're a clutch player, Jake Riley. 
 Go act like it. 
 (breathing slowly) 
 (door opens) 
 Hey, Teresa? 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I was visualizing. 
 They taught us in this birthing class we went to. 
 I know it probably sounds dumb. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 What-what do you see? 
 Uh, well, that's kind of the problem. 
 When I imagined this, I was in a hospital, you know? 
 There were doctors and... a monitor to hear the baby's heartbeat. 
 Not to mention drugs. 
 I'm guessing you guys don't keep an epidural in the kitchen? 
 Hey, Teresa, you know, all that would be great. 
 But you know, women have been giving birth for thousands of years without any of it, so I'm guessing nature just takes over. 
 My great-grandmother gave birth in a field in Maine and went right back to picking blueberries. 
 See? Who needs an epidural when you got stories like that? 
 (sighs) 
 (coughing) 
 Patient Alan Rockwell. 
 Disease progression from onset of symptoms... highly accelerated. 
 Dr. Cannerts. 
 I see you made it out of isolation all right. 
 I did, yes. 
 Very happy to see how great you're doing. 
 How's Thomas? 
 Remarkably sanguine about being back here. 
 I just wish... 
 It was just wildly unlucky. 
 The tests I ran to make sure he wasn't contagious. 
 The virus happened to mutate exactly within the target sequence of my PCR primers, which produced a false negative. 
 At least now I can isolate his antibodies and perhaps... 
 Make a vaccine? 
 Not exactly. 
 It's called passive immunization. 
 And they've used it for Ebola and it could really be effective to help fight the symptoms, especially now that it's taking longer... 
 It's taking longer for people to get sick. 
 I pay attention. 
 Yes. 
 I've noticed. 
 How much longer? 
 Most people with the Thomas strain, they haven't shown symptoms until past 40 hours. 
 Uh, 42 hours, 41, 45. 
 So if I've made it through 42 hours that means nothing. 
 When you said I was doing great, you were lying. 
 Again. 
 (door beeps, opens) 
 Less than six hours. 
 Nothing to it. 
 _ 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 Lex :  Excuse me. 
 Woman :  Dr. Lommers. 
 Excuse me. 
 Over here. 
 Excuse me. Thank you. 
 Dr. Lommers. 
 Dr. Lommers, over here. Any word about what's going on inside the Cordon? Dr. Lommers. 
 Good morning. Morning. 
 Dr. Lommers. 
 Captain, tell me it's not as bad as we've heard. 
 11 of 12 are symptomatic. 
 And the one who isn't? 
 He will be soon. 
 You told me not to send them in. 
 Captain, you and I aren't so different. 
 We both have to make hard decisions with not enough information. 
 The only difference is I've been through this before. 
 You can trust me. 
 I will. 
 You have my word. 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 Man : Dr. Lommers. 
 Woman : Dr. Lommers, why can't people know the truth about what happened? 
 You're absolutely right. 
 If you'll follow me. 
 (clamoring continues) 
 Man : Mr. Carnahan, can you shed any light on this? 
 America deserves the truth. 
 If there are any parents with small children watching, you should please turn away now. 
 Man : I think we're gonna get a look inside. 
 (coughing) 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 That was hard to see, I know. 
 But it's critical we know what we're facing. 
 Many have questioned my methods. 
 This is why I do what I do. 
 This is what I've been protecting you from. 
 If we follow the rules, if we insist that the Cordon is never breached, then we can survive it. 
 We can save this city. 
 We can save America. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 This is Lindsay Savage reporting to you live from the Cordon wall, where we've just been able to speak live with Dr. Lommers.

 Jake :  It was bad, Lex. 
 And it wasn't looters. 
 And the TV was still there and the food. 
 The only thing gone was their computer. 
 All the papers... they were burned up. 
 And even the way the women's bodies were wrapped. 
 It looked like s-s... 
 Hey. 
 (bangs wall) 
 Are you even listening to me? 
 They didn't leave a trace in there, okay? 
 Whoever did this... 
 Lommers, Jake. 
 It was Lommers. 
 I mean, if you'd seen her this morning... the way she worked the press... 
 Lommers. 
 So she's got someone on the inside. 
 Or she sent someone in. 
 And who do we know that got sent in? 
 Who, Meese? 
 No, he fell in. He might be working with that-that gang, but he's not s... 
 They had an APD sat phone. 
 Oh, my... 
 The gang... they had an APD sat phone. 
 Meese just fell in? 
 With one of the department's only sat phones? 
 Chief. 
 Wait, what? 
 She's working with the chief. 
 (scoffs) What? No. 
 Yes. 
 No. That doesn't even... 
 Yes. He has the keys to the sat phones. 
 He's always telling me to get right with Lommers. 
 He's at that woman's beck and call. 
 There is no way that she would work with anyone like Meese, so she gets the chief to do her dirty work. 
 Jana :  I'm sure everything is fine. 
 No. It's been too long since my last contraction. 
 I don't think I can feel her moving anymore. 
 What if she... 
 No. I'm sure if you were hooked up to a monitor right now you would hear her heartbeat just fine, okay? 
 Just because we don't have that doesn't mean it's not happening. 
 Wait. 
 Why don't we have that? 
 Just... Just... 
 What? 
 .. give me a minute. 
 (whispering): Okay. 
 (door closes) 
 You guys have, uh, office birthdays, right? 
 Like, with balloons? 
 What could you possible want... 
 Suzy, I need a balloon. Please. 
 Go fish. 
 We're playing Crazy Eights. 
 You're so weird. 
 (chuckles) Guilty. 
 Wasn't Dad weird too? 
 What do you mean? 
 Like... didn't he eat two whole jars of peanut butter one time? 
 Where did you hear that? 
 Well, Grandma never has peanut butter at her house. 
 So I told her she should get some. 
 Then she got mad. 
 And then she felt bad and told me the story. 
 What exactly did she tell you? 
 She said that Dad was confused, and didn't know what he was doing. 
 I think that's weird, right? 
 Like, how could you not notice? 
 Unless... 
 Unless what? 
 Unless you're on drugs. 
 He was. 
 Yeah. 
 And so was I. 
 For a while. 
 But I'm guessing you already know that. 
 Grandma told me that part. 
 Look, honey, that was a mistake that I made a long, long time ago, and I would never, ever do it again. 
 I know. 
 And, anyway, Jake doesn't like peanut butter. 
 (chuckles) 
 You asked him? 
 He said he's more of a bratwurst guy. 
 Lots of mustard. 
 Sounds about right. 
 Leo : When this is all over, I think I'll move out to the burbs. 
 More space, less deadly virus. 
 Lex : That's really interesting, Leo. Can you focus? 
 There must be a money trail. 
 I know Meese... he wouldn't do anything for free. 
 I can't get a warrant for his accounts, and I can't go at the chief without some leverage. 
 Yeah, I'm working on it. 
 Here she is now. 
 Got to go.

 (knocking) 
 Hi. Sorry to bother you. Um, I've actually been interested in buying this house for some time, uh, but now it seems to be... 
 Out of foreclosure, yes. 
 Okay, would you mind, uh, if I asked you about it anyway? 
 I'm just... crazy for real estate, and yours is the nicest house on the block. 
 Oh. Sure. 
 How about this? 
 Will it work? 
 I don't know. I mean, I can't say most doctors use a party balloon to magnify sound, but... 
 Hey, we might as well find out, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 (panting) 
 (chuckles) 
 Sam : You try. 
 (heart beating) 
 (pounding on glass) 
 What was that?

 Dennis : Hey! 
 I'm-I'm back. 
 (pounding) Suzy? 
 Hey! Suzy! 
 Dennis? 
 Suzy. 
 Uh... 
 Hey. 
 Let-let me in. 
 Let's-let's-let's... let's talk. Um... 
 (distant chatter) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (gun cocks) 
 Uh-uh. 
 It's all right, it's all right. 
 Go on. 
 Trey : It's the food drop cowboy. 
 I just want to talk to Meese. 
 Is your gun gonna play a part in that conversation? 
 Man : Yeah, sure do. 
 Meese, you son of a bitch. 
 I know what you did in that apartment. 
 (sighs) 
 What apartment? 
 You know, the good news for you is I'm not here because you're a worthless traitor, okay? 
 I just want the research. 
 Why? 
 You know it won't change anything. 
 You'll still be stuck in here. 
 Might as well have a beer. 
 You know... 
 Those are hard to come by. 
 Yeah, and so's a conscience, apparently. 
 You want the research? 
 Yeah. 
 Fine. 
 Go back for the ashes. 
 I may be a traitor, but I'm not sloppy. 
 (laughs) Yeah, you know the, uh... 
 (sniffles) 
 ...the girl that ran the store... she had your phone. 
 You're sloppier than you think. 
 You saw Teresa? 
 Yeah. 
 I want the phone back. 
 And where the hell is Montana? 
 I gave your guy the phone, okay? He left. 
 If he didn't make it back... 
 And Teresa? 
 I don't know how she is, actually. 
 Don't move. 
 Make sure she stays strong for the baby. 
 I got kids, too. 
 Outside. 
 (yelling, pounding) 
 Dennis : Come on, let me in! 
 Come on! Hey! (pounding continues) 
 That one's 65 seconds, which is good. When contractions are longer than a minute, it means you're getting close. 
 Okay. How do you know that? 
 Uh, I-I don't. I watch... I watch a lot of television. 
 (pounding continues) 
 Should we...? 
 No, we'll be fine. Just... 
 Just sit there on the table. 
 (groans) 
 You're doing really great, okay? 
 Suzy, just let me in. 
 I-I just... I just want to talk. 
 Hey, no! You need to leave! 
 No! No, I... Listen, I want to... Suzy? 
 Please just listen. 
 I am, Dennis. 
 I am. You can talk from there, okay? 
 I'm gonna die, and I know that. 
 And it makes you think about things. 
 Suzy, we're... we're gonna have a baby. 
 So, if-if you... if you just let me in, we'll talk. I-I'll stay in my office. 
 I don't want to be alone. I want to be with you and our baby. 
 Actually, I took a pregnancy test this morning, and it's okay. 
 I'm not, so, you're off the hook. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 You should go. 
 You have to go. 
 Now. 
 Well, I-I guess this is... this is good-bye then, huh? 
 (gasping) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Yeah. 
 I'm actually looking at him right now. 
 Go on. I'll be right there. 
 Okay, I will. 
 Thanks, Leo. 
 I'm sorry about that, Chief. 
 My friend was just telling me how volatile the housing market is. 
 One day you have a home at foreclosure. 
 The next, you fall into the Cordon, and suddenly your house is safe. 
 And your wife's on a shopping spree. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm talking about the donation made to Abigail Meese from the APD with your signature on it. 
 That was standard. Her husband got hurt on the job. 
 I know, and quite frankly, it's a pretty paltry standard. 
 It makes me wonder how she managed to save her house with it, let alone clear 50 grand of her husband's gambling debts. 
 That's none of my business. 
 But Lommers made it your business. 
 I can probably track down the proof. 
 Or some fat deposit from a shell corporation? 
 But first, I need to know why. 
 Meese, I understand... he's weak... but you? 
 How the hell she get to you? 
 You know how? 
 She convinced me. 
 This is the way it has to be done. 
 You send in a cop to clear out evidence against a Syrian family, because the public doesn't need the details... especially when it might incite violence against Muslims in this country. Believe me. 
 It was the right thing to do. 
 That's what she told you. 
 What? 
 The evidence in that apartment would not have damned the Syrians. It would've damned her. 
 Sayid was not Patient Zero... he was just some kid. 
 The real guy is someone Lommers knew. 
 No, no, no, no. Why would she do that? 
 We don't know. 
 But you can help us get closer. 
 Chief, you can fix this. 
 But you have to tell me everything. 
 (gasping) 
 I think it's time. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, Teresa, does it feel like you want to start pushing now? 
 Can I just...? (stammers) 
 I-I need my mom here for this! 
 I need my mom, okay? 
 (groaning) 
 Jana : Okay, um... 
 I-I-I-I need her! 
 Teresa, your mom... 
 I need my mom! She promised me she'd be here! 
 I need to steal Jana for a sec. Sam? 
 You good? 
 Okay, I'm gonna be right back, okay? 
 Breathe, sweetie. 
 Sweetie... 
 (groaning loudly) 
 Breathe, Teresa. 
 Hey, slow down for a sec! 
 You're right. This was a terrible idea. 
 Okay. 
 We're not just pretending. We're lying to her! 
 Jana... 
 And now she's asking for her mother. 
 And what am I supposed to say... "Oh, hey, Teresa, your mother walked out of here with a giant zombie bite and she's definitely super dead"? 
 No, no, I'd temper that... 
 How am I supposed to help her? 
 I've never had a mom! 
 And-and Sam has got grandmothers with blueberries, and I don't even know where I was born or how or... 
 Jana? 
 Stop it, okay? 
 Listen to me. 
 Who cares how you were born? 
 Look at you now. 
 There's no one I'd rather have in a crisis and, well, I should know because that could be me in eight-months time. 
 With the pick of anyone in this world to have next to me? 
 I pick you. 
 Every time. 
 Okay. 
 (panting) 
 Teresa? 
 You got to breathe. You got to breathe. 
 Teresa? 
 Okay. 
 I need to tell you something, okay? 
 Your mom's not coming. 
 And you know what? 
 Xander's not gonna be by your side, either. 
 But it's okay. 
 'Cause you're not doing it for them. 
 You're doing it for yourself. 
 (panting) 
 (mumbling, groaning) 
 I think you were right before! 
 (muttering) 
 It's time to push! 
 Okay. Okay, so on three, we push. 
 Okay? Ready? 
 Both : One, two, three! 
 (screams) 
 You're back. 
 Katie, I know you're upset with me, but you don't know the whole story. 
 Try me. 
 What matters is that I'm working as hard as I can to save us. 
 What I was saying about Thomas' blood... 
 Stop. 
 You're doing it again. 
 What? 
 When you want to get me off track, you throw science at me. 
 You did the same thing every time I asked about when Sayid died. 
 You made me feel like I was an annoying girl asking stupid questions. 
 But turns out, not so stupid. 
 Because I figured it out. 
 Katie, I assure you there is nothing to figure out. 
 (chuckles) 
 You're right. 
 I'm sure that's why you ripped up a hospital logbook. 
 That's okay. 
 We were still able to find out who Henry Burns was. 
 Yes. 
 Well, I have, um... 
 Like I said, there's work to be done. 
 I should... 
 Hey, Dr. Cannerts? 
 You're a coward. 
 (screaming) 
 Let's just cool you down a little bit, huh? 
 She's gonna pass out soon. 
 What do we do then? 
 I promised Xander I'd tell him something, but I... 
 You can lie. 
 You can lie. 
 All right. 
 Just go. 
 You're doing great. 
 No, not again. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 (Teresa screaming) 
 Hey, is she...? 
 Yes. 
 Right now? 
 Yes! 
 Just tell me they train cops to... 
 Yes, they do. 
 I might be sick. I don't know. 
 Xander : Just please help her, please. 
 Last contractions were at about a minute. 
 Please! 
 Jake : Hey, Teresa, Teresa. 
 Hey. Remember me? 
 It looks like you might be having a baby, which is great news, because I actually know how to deliver babies, okay? 
 I've just been waiting for an opportunity. 
 It hurts. It hurts. 
 I know, I know. 
 Listen, first baby is supposed to be this hard, all right? 
 Now, from what Sam told me, it sounds like you are right on track. 
 Really? It's normal? 
 Yeah. 
 Totally normal. 
 Hey, hey. 
 I'm gonna check under the blanket now. Is that okay? 
 Yeah? 
 I can see her. 
 I can see her. 
 Is she (indistinct)? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Suzy, grab that pillow for me. 
 We're gonna sit you up a little, okay? 
 It's less pressure on your spine, a little easier for the baby to come out. 
 And I know your legs are tired, but I need you to put your knees up for me. 
 Okay, this is it. This is it, okay, Teresa? 
 On your next contraction, you're gonna push, okay? 
 (whimpering) 
 Hey. 
 Shh! 
 This is the best part. 
 ...confidence down there in Atlanta? 
 Dr. Lommers has more than that. 
 I've been getting calls and e-mails from people really impressed with what she did this morning. 
 They like that she was honest, and, frankly, they like her hard-line attitude. 
 They're scared, Bob. 
 Of course they are, Bob. 
 She scared them. 
 I think people are in. 
 Anchor : So would you say that the protests have quieted down... 
 She is good, man. 
 You have to admit it... she's very, very good. 
 It'll be nicer when my story blows hers out of the water. 
 You can't print this. 
 _ 
 Why not? 
 We're still working on it, and, uh, we don't have enough evidence to convict. 
 In court, maybe, but it doesn't mean we can't get it out there, convict her in the press. 
 In-in that press? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I mean, you print this now, and she'll just spin it. 
 Lex, this woman has to pay for what she's done. 
 Look, you want an exposé, but that's not gonna help the people on the inside. 
 Getting her out of power will. 
 Don't you want someone in charge whose first priority is protecting these people rather than covering her own ass? 
 You're damn right I do, but if you're gonna shoot at the king, you can't miss, and right now, with this circumstantial evidence, up against a king like that... 
 We'd miss. 
 We'd miss. 
 All right, what's your plan? 
 We need to change the script. 
 It worked for her, it can work for us, but I need you to trust me. 
 I don't. 
 But I can give you two hours, then I'm gonna press "send." 
 (screaming) 
 Hey, you're almost there. 
 No, no, no, you're almost there. 
 Teresa, hey, I just need one more push from you. 
 Just one more push. Just one more. 
 Jana : So close, Teresa. 
 Teresa : No, no, I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 And you're gonna surprise yourself, and I promise you that's gonna feel really good. 
 Okay, one more push, and you're gonna meet your baby girl, okay? 
 Come on. 
 Jake : Knees up, knees up. There you go. 
 There you go. Come on. 
 Jana : One more push. 
 (screaming continues) 
 (baby crying) 
 There-there's your baby. 
 There she is. 
 There she is. 
 Hey, you did it. 
 You did it.

 (sirens wailing) 
 You're late. 
 We've got a meeting. 
 This is the meeting. 
 Do you want to explain yourself? 
 I want you to resign. 
 That's a pretty bold request, Major. 
 Would you like to tell me why? 
 Or should I just read quietly? 
 Well, I see that you and your vlogger buddy have been rather busy. 
 (sighs) Not that you've found any actual evidence, I'm sure it felt like fun detective work at the time. 
 Do you think this is a joke? 
 That we wouldn't take this public? 
 I think you can take anything you want public. 
 I'd be happy to go a few rounds with you on national television. 
 If you've noticed, I do quite well there. 
 Come on, Lex. I see what you have here. 
 A phone call to an unregistered number on an island with 50,000 summer residents. 
 It's hardly damning. 
 This isn't a courtroom, this is just you and me, and I'm asking you why. 
 And I'm telling you that you're out of your depth here, Major. 
 And I think you should forget this, in the name of national security. 
 I have more than a phone call. 
 I have the chief. 
 Maybe I don't know why you did it, but I have a respected, decorated chief of police who can testify that you ordered him to destroy evidence of a colossal conspiracy you orchestrated. 
 Resign now. 
 You can spin it any way you like. 
 You need "more time with the family"... that's a classic. 
 "Gonna start a nonprofit in California," 
 I really don't care as long as you get out of my city and you never come back. 
 I'll call a press conference for tomorrow. 
 And you'll resign. 
 And I'll resign.

 Well, it's a long story, but it ends with all of us getting bratwursts. 
 (chuckles) 
 Perfect. 
 And I want to hear all about it, right after I tell you that I just delivered a baby. 
 What? 
 And I'm not gonna lie, it was crazy. 
 I mean, the mother, this, uh, this 18-year-old girl, she was amazing, I don't... I don't know how she did it. 
 I don't know how you did it. 
 By the way, good job. 
 Yeah, well, it's all kind of a blur. 
 Thankfully. 
 But I bet it would have been a lot easier if you had been there. 
 There's always next time. 
 (both laugh) 
 I was thinking I'd go grab us some dinner. 
 And then maybe you and I can sit down...
