 - Previously on  This Is Us... 
 - (whispering): Hello? 
 RON: Hey, Kevin, uh,it's Ron Howard calling. 
 Um, I'm prepping a movie right now that I'm gonna direct. 
 You would be perfect. 
 I would? 
 Can you do that? 
 - JACK:  What are you doing? 
 - RANDALL: If I can find people You know we have to tell the girls, right? We're gonna foster a kid, bring another child into the home. They need to know about it. What if we get a kid that has serious issues that we're not prepared for? I'm worried. I have been drunk for weeks. And I need to get a handle on it before I can walk back into that house. If you have a problem, we will fix it together. You know, you never really talk about your dad's death. (crying) KATE:  We-we have to find Kev. He needs to hear it from me. JACK: It's been three weeks now. And, um... I finally feel like I'm tackling this thing for real. So that's good. I know I'm supposed to talk more to you guys, um, really bare my soul. (laughs softly) Feels like you get extra credit around here for... for crying. (Chuckles) Um... I-I promised my wife that we would talk more, this time. But, um... I'm finding that harder to do. (insects chirping) Hmm. REBECCA: Hi. Are you coming up soon? Yeah, I'm... I'm almost done, just doing my steps. Okay. - Well, I'll see you up here. - Okay. JACK:  I know that men, we're supposed to talk   about their issues nowadays. You know, the strong silent type is out, and... and guys like that sensitive kid on  My So-Called Life  are in. (chuckles) At least, that's what my daughter taught me. Um... But I've gone this way for a very long time. REBECCA: Hey. Sleep, baby. You need to go to bed. I will. - Is everything okay? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Good night. JACK:  I've got two sons, though. (typing) Still young. So I-I hope they don't end up cavemen like me. You know, I hope that if something's-something's weighing them down, I hope that they don't keep it bottled up. (exhales) ♪ Mm. Something smells good. Marinara? It's been three weeks, Beth. Three weeks since we've been approved to foster. Oh, damn. Bolognese. I love it when you cook your feelings. I just don't understand what's taking so long. Right? We got a bedroom set up. Got the girls on board. Look at this place. There's two staircases, kitchen island the size of Maui. Yeah, 'cause kids in need love them some big old kitchen islands. - Don't... mm... - (phone ringing) - Mm. Do not get excited. - Hold on. Okay, the last time you got excited, it was  Vanity Fair  calling to see if we wanted to renew our subscription. - I know. I didn't... - And the time before that, it was the wrong number looking for "Johnny." I know. We should get rid of the landline. So I'm gonna answer this phone, okay? But I am sure it is not an agent calling with a kid for us. - (whispers): Oh, my God. - Answer the phone, woman. - (chuckles) Hello? Yeah, this is she. Okay. (drawer opens) (drawer closes, pen clicks) Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah. Great. (laughs) All right, I'll see you soon. Bye-bye. - (pen clatters) - Well? Her name is Deja. - As in "déjà..." - Vu, yeah. She's    years old, and she's been in and out of foster care a bunch of times, and her mom just got arrested, so they moved her out of her home. What about the dad? They said we'll get the case file in a couple days. - And? - And she's on her way over. Wow. This is it. It's happening, Beth. I know, baby. I really think that being a foster parent was my calling. Like that call was my calling calling. - Randall... - To honor my parents' legacy, to honor William's life! I know, it's very moving. - But I want you to breathe... - Mm-mm. Tess! Annie! - (claps hands) Family meeting! - ...breathe through it. - KATE:  This is so cool. - KEVIN: I know. KATE:  Everybody looks, like, busy and important. Everybody on  The Manny just looked pasty and sad. Well, that's comedy writers for you, you know? They don't get enough sun, so... Anyway, thank you so much for coming and hanging out with me today. You know it means a lot to me, right? Are you kidding? I can't believe Sylvester Stallone is in your movie. I can't believe it, either. I know. It's unbelievable. So, so first up today, we have this, like, super emotional scene, right? Right before we go into battle, where I deliver this epic monologue about how every single thing in my life has led up to this very moment. Which is crazy, because everything in your life  has  led you to this moment. I know. Right? And then, tonight, we have this, just, unbelievable action sequence, right, where I get to go in there and save Sylvester Stallone's life? Can you imagine? I'm on a movie set, saving Sylvester Stallone's life? (Sylvester Stallone impression): Every champion was once a contender who refused to give up. You... SYLVESTER STALLONE: Not so bad. - (laughs) - Oh. Oh, Lord. Ah, Mr. Stallone, how are you? - How are you? - Kevin Pearson here. Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - KEVIN: Uh, AKA Lieutenant Booker. - Mm. - Please don't kick me off your set for doing a horrendous Rocky impression. I think I'll let it slide. Anyway, it's good to meet you, Kevin. - Hey, good to meet you, too. I... oh! - Uh, my sister Kate. - Oh. - Yeah. - Pleasure. Pleasure to meet you. - She's happy to meet you, too. Say hi. - (chuckles) - Hi. - Hi. - Sylvester Stallone. - No. "Sly." Sly is good. - Okay. Sly. - Mm-hmm. - (Kate giggles) - Is... I'm starving. I'm gonna go check out the, uh, frittata situation so I'll catch up with you guys later. KEVIN: All right. - Nice to meet you, Kate. Okay. You, too. - Enjoy your frittata. - Bye. (Kevin chuckles) (laughs) - What just happened? - I don't know. Um, Sylvester Stallone knows my name. You name has never sounded cooler. Oh, my God, I wish Dad was here. Ugh! - Stallone was his hero. - I know. God, he would've been so proud of you, Kev. - Right. I mean, to see this set, and all you've accomplished. What you've gone through. Yeah, but I mean, he-he can't see it, though. Right? So, uh... Check that out. All right? You know what we should do? - Mm-mm. - We should take a selfie in the tank. Send it to Randall? He'll get a kick out of that. - Come on. - All right. KATE: He was like, "Oh, call me Sly." What? - Morning, everyone. - ALL: Morning. REBECCA: Can I make you some breakfast? No, I'm good. I'm gonna get something along the way. Okay. Bye. - KATE: Bye, Dad. - KEVIN: See you. Hmm. KEVIN: Hey, Randall. Who do you think's hotter, Brandy or Mariah Carey? They're both really hot. How are you playing "Who's Hotter" right now? Our family's falling apart. Mom and Dad are barely talking. Oh, my God, Kate. They're fine, okay? Hey, Randall. Come on. Would you tell her they're fine? They're fine. I got to run a... quick little errand. I'll-I'll see you guys after school. An errand? I'm sorry, are you Mom? (Kate chuckles) Uh, I put an ad in the paper looking for my birth parents. Yeah. This woman wrote back. She says she's my mom. Meeting her at Schenley Park. Give me that. KATE: Hi, Headless Soldier Number Two. Are you following me? - Mm-mm. - (laughs) Explain something to me. Why do they always have to put melon and fruit and things in the water like, you know, like, there's, like, swamp animals in there. I remember when water... ready for this? - Was just water. What happened? - (laughs) - I know, tell me about it. - (laughs): I know. - Anyway. - Yeah. Sylvester Stallone? I don't want to take up much of your time, I just want to tell you that... (exhales) ...you were our dad's favorite actor. - Oh, thank you. - I mean, we watched all your movies, like, a thousand times. - Really? I appreciate that. - Yeah. And seriously, I know  Rocky  by heart. So does Kevin. And we would watch it when we had a cold, when my dad had a cold, even... - Really? You know what? Why don't you bring your father down to the set sometime? Since he's such a fan and everything, we'll take a picture. It'd be my pleasure. Oh, no, um... Our dad actually died when we were in high school. - I'm s... - So. (exhales sharply) - I'm sorry. - Yeah, thanks. You know, you just made my dad feel good. You could help him forget a     degree fever, or a bad day at work. I just, you know, I just want to thank you for making my dad feel good. Thank you for telling me that. You're welcome. I really appreciate this. - Very sweet. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Ah. (chuckles) - Hey. - Hmm. You don't really know all of  Rocky  by heart, do you? - You questioning me? - (chuckles) (singing "Gonna Fly Now" by Bill Conti) "November   th,     , Philadelphia." - We pan down from the Jesus mural. - Oh, come on. - This is unbelievable. Yeah? - Right? When you're, when you're in the ring. - Yeah. I'm impressed. - Okay. - Okay. You're... - Don't question me. - "Yo, Adrian." You're the new Adrian. Oh, my God. So, now I have Amber Monday through Friday. Miguel has her on the weekends. And we bought Amber a car so she would hate us less. But, um, it's not working. (chuckles) I'm sure she's just adjusting, still. - Mm... So how have you and Jack been? I mean, since your fight. - We're fine. - Yeah? Yeah. I mean, we mumble "hello" to each other in the morning, and we, uh, kiss each other good night before bed. Mm. When was the last time you had s*x? It's been a while. - Becca... - What? - Have s*x with Jack. - (scoffs) - It's not that simple. - You're wrong. I am telling you, if you let so much time go by that the answer to that question is "It's been a while..." That was the beginning of the end for me and Miguel. (sighs) I mean, I guess I could plan... a night away from the kids. - Yeah. But the whole romantic date night thing, that's always been Jack's department. SHELLY:  So now it's your department. Come on, just think of something. Think of somewhere special to take him. Do something. Put on a pretty dress. Slap a big carefree smile on your face and just sweep your husband off his feet. What's all this? I'm Jack Pearsoning you. That's a term I made up for when you sweep someone off their feet. Come on, get in the car. That is so pretty, Annie. She's gonna love it. Okay, people, let's get our game faces on. Remember what we learned? When she gets here, we'll give her a tour of the house, repeat our names a lot so that she learns them, keep asking if she has any questions. It was on all the foster parents blogs. How do you spell "Deja"? D-E-J-A. I hope. - (doorbell rings) - RANDALL: Ah. - (exhales) Here we go. - Alright. Hey there. Come in, please. - LINDA: Hi, guys. - BETH: Hi. This is Deja. RANDALL: Hi, Deja. It's really nice to meet you. I'm Randall. I'm Beth. We're so happy to have you here. This is Tess and Annie. TESS: Hi. ANNIE: Hi. Hi. ANNIE: I made this for you. (audio drops very low): This is our snack drawer. You can help yourself to anything you want. And the white board over there is where we make our grocery lists. So if you ever have any special requests, just put 'em down right there. I want to go to bed. Bed. No, bed we can do. I'm gonna leave you guys to get to know each other. Bye, Deja. I'll walk you out. Sorry, Linda? Is that it? Are you just leaving? 'Cause I don't think she's okay. That is correct. - She is most definitely not okay. - Okay. She just got yanked out of her family, plopped down with a bunch of strangers. So, what do we do? In most of the blogs I read, the kids were a bit more responsive. Well, I'd tell you, the... the first night is the hardest part, but I'd be lying. You and your family, you're doing a great thing. Just be patient, have zero expectations and... don't try to predict how a single day will turn out. It's not exactly your temperament, huh? - I'm working on it. - (laughs) Okay, you've got my number if there's an emergency. I'll reach out tomorrow when we get her full file from Child Services. - Okay. Thank you. (exhales) (indistinct conversation) Whatever happens out there, I will fight like hell I will protect my men, and I guarantee you, by nightfall, I'll have you back in your bunk writing those dirty letters that your wife likes so much. You got my word on that. Boom! That's the one. KATE: You really don't think I'm too old? No way. I don't know if anyone believes I, you know, can make a living at being a singer, so... No, it really doesn't matter what other people think. Seriously. No. I'll tell you what people didn't think. They didn't think I could write  Rocky  in three days... it happened. I'll tell you something else, they didn't think I could act in it. Guess what, it happened. Sometimes, people can be real idiots. - Real idiots. Real. - I'm telling you, it's, like, contagious. - (laughs) - Yo, yo. Guys. - KATE: Hey. - How are we? - You got a great sister here. Yes, I do. Thank you for noticing. We like here a lot. We're gonna keep her. - KATE: Thank God. - All right, guys, we are lit and ready for you on set, gentlemen. KEVIN: All right. - Okay, great. - Knock 'em dead. - Will do. - See you around. - Okay. - Here we go. My sister didn't ask you to sign anything, did she? I had to beg her to leave her Rambo figurines at home. (chuckles) We were just talking about her singing. Yeah. Yeah, she mentioned your father a little bit. He'd be really proud of you. Look at this. I keep hearing that, yeah. Nah, it's got to be tough not having him here. - I get it. - Yeah. It was a long time ago, you know, for me, so... It's a funny thing, when you think about it... time. Your sister sings a couple of bars of  Rocky,  and for a split second I can smell the ring again. And then she tells me that when you were little kids, you watched a lot of my movies, and I'm thinking for a moment about my kids, when they were little... the messy hair, the matching pajamas and all that stuff... and I swear to you, I can see it all so very clearly I could just reach out... ...touch it. In my experience, Kevin, there's no such a thing as "a long time ago." There's only memories that mean something and memories that don't. Right. Let's do one for your father. - Okay? - Okay, you guys want to run the lines, or you want to just roll? - Let's roll. Good? - Yeah. - Okay. SLATE GUY: Scene   , take one. RON: And action. Sir, first of all, I want to thank you for everything. And I want you to know... I'm sorry, uh, I need a line, please. WOMAN: "I want to thank you for everything you've done for me. And, sir, whatever happens..." Got it. Okay. Thank you. - Could we... Sorry. - That's all right. KEVIN: Sorry, Ron. Could we get back into it? Yeah, yeah, no problem. Just keep going. RON: And action. First of all, thank you, sir, - Mm. - ...for everything. Uh... Guys, can we... It's not, uh... I can see all the, uh, the movement back there. - Sorry. - (sighs) - Nah, I heard it, too. - Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Just go from the top. - Thank you. - RON: Here we go... still rolling. What's the word? - The first word. - "I." "I wanted to thank you..." Just the first word's all I needed. Thank you, though, for all the rest of them. - All right. - Sorry, guys. I got you a new toothbrush. The bathroom's just down the hall to the left. - (whispering indistinctly) - Hi. How we doing in here? Can we give her back? No, baby, we can't give her back. Why would you want to do that? She didn't like my painting. (sighs) I don't think that's true. I think she's just shy. She barely talks. Tess, put yourself in Deja's shoes. - It's a brand-new house... DEJA (in distance): Hey. Hey! - ...brand-new family. DEJA: Why do you have these? - Those are mine. - ...putting away your clothes... You said this was my room. - It is your room... - No! - Give 'em back, you bitch! - Hey. Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, what's the matter? BETH: Hey... Hold on. We're okay. Right? We're okay. Everybody's okay. No, everything is... yeah. WOMAN: Is it you? Who posted the ad? I couldn't remember which park I said to meet at. I see how you're looking at me. Your dad just had really dark skin. You said in your ad that, um, you didn't need money, so I thought, "Well, my boy's doing well." Uh, if you don't need money, then you have money, right? You have money? Where you going? Wait. - Randall, what... - It's not her. Let's go. KATE: Randall, wha... Randall. I see what you're doing now. We came here for one of our first dates. REBECCA:  One of our best dates. JACK: So that explains the Chevelle, the burgers, but no concert tonight. No concert that night, either. Yeah, 'cause it got rained out. Uh-huh. So we stayed in the car. And we listened to Billy on the radio. - Yeah. - Yeah. ♪ I never asked for much before ♪ ♪ Not before ♪ ♪ Things are changed, I need more... ♪ So, should we eat our burgers? I was thinking that maybe we... we could eat our burgers later. Oh. Okay. Okay. (closing bag) Yeah, that's... that's good, too. ♪ I never thought that she would say ♪ ♪ Say good-bye ♪ ♪ But she did ♪ ♪ And now I want to die ♪ ♪ I want to die ♪ ♪ I never thought that I would need ♪ ♪ Need a friend ♪ ♪ Oh, but I did... ♪ 
 
 (whispering): Ba-Babe, babe, hey. Maybe we can just, we just wait. Just-just wait for just... just, ba-baby, just slow-slow down. - Maybe just... slow down a bit. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. I'm sorry. There's just been a lot going on lately, you know? - Okay, I'm sorry. - No, I... Yeah, this was a really, um... this was silly to plan our thing like this. - No, it... Oh, I... (Rebecca sighs) She calmed down. I told her we'd all talk about it in the morning after we got some rest. Tess and Annie are a little freaked out, so they're gonna sleep in the same room tonight, but I turned on the baby monitor so we can hear if anything is going on. Really? You didn't even get out the baby monitor the first night William was here. - Oh, I didn't? I can't believe I thought I was gonna win this girl over by repeating our names and giving her a tour. It's pretty stupid. Not stupid. Hopeful. Every time someone's told me something was gonna be really hard, it hasn't been that hard. SATs, biz school, New York City Marathon, I study or I train... (sucks teeth) ...it's not that hard. I think this might finally be the thing that's as hard as everyone says it is. It's only been three hours. Everybody said there's gonna be lots of high and lows. RANDALL: Right. Did you see the way she flinched, Beth? - I mean, somebody must've really... - Yeah. (quietly): Yeah. Hey. Oh, that was so good. Off to a rocky start, no pun intended, but gosh, once you got going, it was awesome. Kate, why would you tell Sylvester Stallone about our dad? I just wanted to thank him. Yeah, okay, because, you know what, him bringing up to me two seconds before the scene started really threw me. - Oh. - Yeah. Well, I... I'm sorry. It kind of seems that it throws you no matter who brings him up or when. What are you talking... that's not true. - That's not true at all. - Come on, Kev. - You-you never talk about it. - Well, you know what, so, 'cause I don't want to wallow in sadness about it, I have a problem? - Okay, there is a difference between wallowing and actually having a normal conversation about it. - Mm-hmm. - There is. - Okay. - And, you know what, when I went to my weight-loss camp and I, you know what, I saw a therapist... here's the thing about that, though, And she asked me about Dad's death... right now, I don't have time for that. I got an action scene that's coming up and I don't have time to talk about this right... And I couldn't talk about it. I couldn't talk about it. And you know what she told me? She told me that if I don't learn to face my grief, that it would be like taking in a deep breath and holding that breath for the rest of my life. That's great. No, that-that, I mean, that's-that's great. I just, I... (laughs) (exhales) There's nothing for me to let out, Kate. I don't... there's not. - I think that... - Our dad died and it's very sad, okay? - Mm-hmm. - It's very sad, but I don't need therapy because of it. - You might. - And I don't need to go to some-some exercise class and scream my head off about it. And here's what I really don't want. I don't need to be talking to Sylvester Stallone about it two seconds before the biggest scene of my entire career. I'm sorry... I am. Yeah, well, you know, I-I-I don't, I'm not like you. We're different people. I don't need to walk around and be sad and damaged just because you are. - Okay, wait. Hold on a sec... - (door slams) (sighs) Sorry. It's fine. You know, it's a lot harder than I thought. AA... talking to you. It's just all harder. Yeah. I can tell. Well... You know, my life before I met you, Bec...it wasn't great. I just kind of tried to get away, you know? Get away from my neighborhood. Get away from my father. Just get away from everything. But now they say that if I want to fix myself, I've got to sit in that. I've got, I've got to sit in all the ugly, horrible years. And they say that on the other side of it, there's relief. That's what they say. But I feel like I'm... holding on... by a thread. I love the night that you planned for us. But it's been awhile since we... And I didn't want the first time again to... I didn't want to feel like I was feeling. (Jack sighs) Baby, you are the strongest person I know. - I don't know. - But I do. I know. I know. I know. Okay. (sighs) Where are you going? I'm gonna get back in the car 'cause I miss talking to you... and I'm not ready to stop yet. (chuckles) What do you want? So, um, who's in charge here? Your mom and dad, like, who makes all the rules? They both do, but... - (both) Mom. - Okay. Um, what happens if you break the rules? She has us talk about it for, like, a million years and sometimes you might lose iPad privileges. What's losing iPad privileges? ANNIE: It means you can't use your iPad for a while. You guys have your own iPads? - Yeah. - Yeah. (scoffs) This house is crazy. ANNIE: If you open that door, the alarm will go off. Oh. Where are you going? Well, I'm having trouble sleeping. First night in a new place, I guess. Where I'm from, there's lots of noise in the streets. It's so quiet here. - You're scared? - No, I'm not scared. It's just... Do you know how to turn off the alarm so I can leave without waking everyone up? Yeah, the code is my birthday, but you should stay. Oh, I don't think so, sweetheart. I came by today to meet your mother and you kiddos and see your house. Your dad seems like the best... work friend a guy could ask for. But I been sleeping in my apartment, doing things my way for a long time. What if I'm bad at... I just don't want to let any one of you down. Once I went to sleep over at my friend Lucy's house, and I got scared and my parents had to pick me up. Later, I was sad I went home because I probably would've had fun if I had stayed. Is that right? So, maybe if you stay here, you'll have fun. And if you go home, you'll be sad. You think so? Okay, then. Hey, can you show me how to turn on the lights in the bathroom? Yeah. You just walk in and wave your hands. - (chuckles) - (giggles) This house is crazy. You can sleep in the reading chair if you're scared. - I'm not scared. ANNIE: Okay. Okay, fine. DEJA (over monitor): Just because the bed in my room sucks. It's too squishy. - (indistinct chatter) - KEVIN: Got it. MAN: Here we go. Start to roll. You like what you see? RON: Yeah, yeah. Sure. Okay, now, Sly's down there, pinned under that Jeep. You and your unit are gonna save him. Remember now, he's like a father to you. And he's gonna die on your watch if you don't save him. - Right. - Lot of pressure, Ron. - All right. - Get ready. - Thank you. All right. ♪ Covered in blood... ♪ RON: Pyro! - ♪ You had the sense ♪ - Action! ♪ To stay calm and contained ♪ ♪ There's no sense in crying my blues ♪ ♪ For my brain ♪ ♪ Leaving me standing outside ♪ ♪ Show me a sign ♪ ♪ Something that's shining ♪ ♪ Like the tears in your eyes ♪ ♪ You can surprise me ♪ ♪ Because I want to be ♪ ♪ The one the one you return to ♪ ♪ You just believe ♪ ♪ You're not alone in the world... ♪ (shouting) - RON: Cut! - Damn it. - Ah! - RON: Kevin, are you good? (Kevin groans) - MAN: Cut there, cut there. - RON: Stay put! - (laughs) - This is your wheelhouse. - No way. You let Shelly...? - (laughs) Advi... she gives horrible advice. Do you remember the time when-when she convinced you to get a crew cut? It was not a crew cut, it was a pixie cut, and I think I looked very chic, thank you. Well, I thought I was married to Peter Pan. (both laugh) That's true, Peter Pan... JACK: Yeah. (insects chirping) Becca, I... (sighs) I borrowed money from my dad to buy our house. (Jack sighs) I was embarrassed that-that I... couldn't provide for us without him. Oh, Jack. And there's... there's a lot of other stuff, too. Uh, that I buried away. And I'll tell you... eventually, just... I'm working on it. - Is that okay? - Yes. Yeah. Of course. I'm ready when you are. - RANDALL: Have a good day, man. - Thank you. (door closes) They just sent over Deja's file. BETH: And? Her mom's in big trouble. (exhales) - (knocking on door) - Hey. - Hey. - KEVIN: We, uh, just wanted to see how you were doing. Yeah, you didn't say much on the bus ride home. Oh, I'm fine. So, Deja. I'm sorry I called you a bitch. Thank you. And those are not my cigarettes. They're my mom's. I wanted to have them to give to her when she picks me up. - Deja... - Hey. (quietly): I got it. You know what I thought of, the first time I heard your name? I thought of the expression "déjà vu." Because you remind me a little of myself. When I was your age. KATE:  Can I ask you something? Why now? Why did you suddenly try to find them? RANDALL:  These are my parents. Jack and Rebecca. They adopted me the day I was born. This is my birth father. William. I met him for the first time last year. My whole childhood, I felt split inside. There are these people that I lived with, and then there were my birth parents, who I had never met. But I thought about them all the time. RANDALL:  It's like, a...  a-a ringing in my ears, and, uh... It quiets down sometimes, but... I-It can quiet down so much, I almost forget it's there, but then, there are some times where it's so loud, I just feel alone. But, I mean, that doesn't have anything to do with you guys. - We know. It's okay. But here's the thing. My life turned out pretty great. And it's not just my big house, or my super-fine wife, all right? I've got this big, amazing extended family. I've got this big, amazing, beautiful life. And if I'm seeing me in you, if seeing you is giving me that sweet, sweet déjà vu feeling, I think that means it's gonna happen for you, too. Okay? Okay.
