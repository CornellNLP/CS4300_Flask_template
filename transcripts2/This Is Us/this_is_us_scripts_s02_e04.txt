 Previously on  This Is Us... 
 Let's do one for your father. 
 (groans) 
 A handyman with triplets. 
 He's a construction foreman, and he does very well for himself. 
 Not well enough. 
 He cannot support three children. 
 What if we get a kid that has serious issues that we're not prepared for? 
 - Those are mine. 
 - I'm putting your clothes in this. 
 - Give them back, you bitch! 
 - Hey. 
 - RANDALL: Whoa, whoa. Beth? 
 - (Deja screams) 
 We're okay. Everybody's okay. 
 No, everything is... It... Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 JACK: Five minutes, people. 
 We still got to get to the grocery store before it really starts coming down. 
 (gasps) How about  Broadcast News? 
 You're always trying to get me to watch  Broadcast News. 
 Has it worked yet? 
 - Huh. 
 - (sighs) 
 - Road House? 
 - Ooh. I do like me some Patrick Swayze. And I'm vetoing  Road House. Hey, Randall. You find anything yet? No. If we really get snowed in, I'm gonna focus on my Rube Goldberg machine. The science fair is only three weeks away. Enough with the science fair, Randall! - Hey, Kev, cool it. - KATE: I picked mine. It's about a baby who can talk. John Travolta. Yes, please. - What is it with you today? - What? No! Someone already rented all three of  The Karate Kid! Oh, no. How is my boy gonna survive this tragedy of titanic proportions? (grunts) - Stop making fun of me. - What's up with you? I just want to go home. - Yeah. - There's no movies, and it's really hot in here. - What is wrong with you? Hey, Jack? He's burning up. Mom, I don't have time to talk about Mrs. Korzen's daughter's new Pontiac. I just need to know if I had chicken pox as a kid. - I'm so itchy, Dad. I'm gonna die. - I promise you, kiddo, in the history of chicken pox, no one's ever died. - Well, ac... - REBECCA: Okay. Yeah. I have sick kids. Mm-hmm. Mom, I got to go. Okay, bye. I had them when I was three. And my mother is exhausting. Good. Since you both had it, you don't need to worry about getting sick again. Which is a relief, because it's much worse as an adult. Now, Randall doesn't have a fever or any symptoms yet like Kevin and Kate. I have a pretty strong immune system. That's an excellent thing, sir. But I always recommend that siblings try and get it all together. One fell swoop and knock it out. Are you people insane? And then Grandpa Williams started flying the helicopter. Then we got cotton candy ice cream, and I woke up. - (chuckles) That is definitely a wild dream. What about you, Deja? Remember any of your dreams? Yeah, me neither, usually. Okay. You get to go,  mamacita. - Thank you. - You got it. Um... I could do your hair, too, Deja, if you want. Picked up some new barrettes. Fun jewel tones. The girls will vouch for me. I never pull too hard. - I'd give you a B-plus. - Yeah. (chuckles) No, I'm good. Okay. All right, little mamas, why don't you get your things ready for school? Here you go. See you in a bit. I don't know what to do. I've changed Annie's hairstyle four times this week just to make hair care look cool. As cute as those Afro puffs were, Deja's not taking the hint. It's been two weeks. She has to wash that hair. Well, she's testing her boundaries. Trying to push us away. We knew this might happen. - Scalp is stinking up the kitchen. - (sighs) I think we have to have a real sit-down talk about this. Look, she already doesn't like it here, Beth. You think telling her, "Hey, we all had a little chat and agreed your hair is funky," is gonna make her feel welcome? Yeah, 'cause that's the way I would say it. Come on, Randall. It's a hygiene issue. We have to address it. I know, but I... Look, for nine years, you got to be the lead parent... "Lead parent"? While I've been sitting in that office, talking about weather patterns. But now you're working full-time and looking damn fine in those suede heels, might I add. - I know. I know you do. Look, Annie scrapes her knee, and she still goes to you first for the boo-boo kiss. Are we seriously having a conversation right now about the order of Annie's boo-boo kisses? May I take the lead here? Please? I just want her to feel like she fits in first before we say something that may alienate her even more. And who knows? Maybe when she's more comfortable with us, she may want to wash it herself. All right. She better get comfortable quick, 'cause your girl is getting ripe. (Randall sighs) ♪ MAN (over TV): Let them burn. Keeping those abs nice and tight. TOBY: If you want to eat the muffin, kid, eat the muffin. - I don't want to. Well, I didn't make it to be a TV hood ornament. That right there is the healthiest poppy seed muffin you will ever eat. I made it with whole wheat, unsweetened almond milk and grape-seed oil. It is so healthy, in fact, it hardly qualifies as a muffin. Quit trying to get me to eat the muffin. All right. Well, then, stop staring at it for a second and look at me. You have been kicking toned ass the last couple weeks. - Thank you. - But it feels... obsessive. You've already thrown away half of the stuff in our kitchen. It wasn't organic. You go to weight group every single day. Last night, I think you were treadmilling in your sleep. And, you know, we haven't really been...  connecting. (sighs) - We had s*x two days ago. - I know, and you were checking your Fitbit calorie burn the whole time. All right. I'm sorry. (sighs) It's just that this is the first big event that I've been paid to sing at, and it needs to go amazing, and I got to fit in that dress. - I know, and you're gonna. And you're gonna look amazing in that dress. All the   -year-old boys at the bat mitzvah are gonna be  shvitzing for you in that dress. Cute. So, can you turn the video back on? - Uh... - I have    minutes left in the workout. - Okay. - Thank you. (clears throat) MAN (on TV): Work those heels, delts here. Hey-hey, Kevin. - Brian, hey. How are you? - Hey. Yeah, I'm good. Hey, can I see you a second? Yeah, you kidding me? I always have time for you, my all-time favorite producer. Just don't tell Dean I said that 'cause he gets a little... - jealous. - Yeah. Can I see your leg? Can you lift up your pant leg? (laughs) Uh, higher. - Really? - Higher. Usually you have to buy a guy dinner before you... - (laughs) Yeah. No. Seriously. All right. - Kevin. Oh, my God. - I know. Listen, it-it... This looks a lot worse than it actually is. You know, I got a little banged up in that scene I did with Stallone, but I'm-I'm fine. Why do you think we have a medic on the set? - No, I know. - I didn't want to slow down production. - There's a reason. - You know, 'cause... See? - Uh, hey. Can you find Delaney for me right away... - No. Brian. - So I can go over today's schedule? Brian, I'm the king of powering through things like this. K-Kevin, I wasn't asking. I wasn't asking. Ow. They really hurt, Dad. Yeah, I know you're suffering, pal,but your sister, she's got the same thing, and she's handling it like a champ. - So? - So, I-I'm thinking you'll feel better if you toughen up a bit. I'm gonna go ahead and run you guys an oatmeal bath here in a bit, all right? - Randall, what are you doing? Yeah, what are you wearing, bud? It's    degrees out. I'm exposing myself to chicken pox like Dr. Grader said. - I need to get it and get it over with - (doorbell rings) - before the science fair. - No, you're gonna get frostbite or pneumonia, all right? So just go upstairs and put your jams on. - (sighs) - Mom? Oh, you sounded so overwhelmed on the phone. - What? Hi. I thought, she needs an extra hand to help with those sick kids. Thank God I made it in before it started really coming down. - Aw, you poor things. - (sighs) - Hi, Jack. - Hi. Would you mind getting my stuff out of the car? - (Rebecca sighs) You know, and you might need to salt that walkway while you're out there, 'cause I almost slipped, broke my neck. - (mouthing) - Oh, for God's sakes. It's the middle of winter. Where are Randall's clothes? So, what are we looking at here, Dr Lo? You have a large tear in your meniscus. It's likely it was slightly damaged when you fractured your knee, which was... Uh, I fractured my knee about    years ago. It's been pretty fine since then. Until two weeks ago. I'm assuming you've been in quite a bit of pain since then. Yeah, I tried taking painkillers for a few days, but I didn't like the way it made me feel. And rather than coming to see me to get the knee looked at, you decided to... - Tough it out. Yeah. Uh, look, here's the thing. We're almost done with the movie, okay? So I really need to get back to work next week so that I can finish my last three scenes, so... ...how do I do that? How do we make that happen? Well, we can do a simple arthroscopic surgery to remove the tear. Three small incisions, in and out in an hour. Many patients walk the same day. ♪ KEVIN:  I itch everywhere, Grandma. I even have chicken pox in a place I can't talk about. (chuckles): Aw. You poor angel. Look at you. You must feel awful. Would presents from Grandma make everyone feel better? - Hmm. - (chuckles) Here we go. Hey, what is she doing here? Did you invite her? No, I'm not a masochist, Jack. I did not invite her. Two minutes in, and she's already commenting on what a mess the house is. I mean, we have ten-year-old triplets. I don't know what she was expecting. What are we gonna do? Well, we can't put her in a car and send her back to Connecticut. - It's... No. No. We can't. - Really? - It's snowing like crazy outside. - (sighs, groans) Look, we're-we're just gonna have to get through it. - (groans) - Just don't let her bait you. I don't let her bait me. - Well, I beg to differ, Bunny. - (exasperated grunt) I hate when she calls me Bunny. I don't even like bunnies. Where does that come from? Says the woman that cannot be baited. Ha. Okay, look, hey, hey. What if a third set of hands is actually gonna be helpful with the kids? (laughs) You're really cute when you're dumb. Yeah? - Don't leave me alone with her. - I know. - Come on. - Remember when you wanted to put that in the wedding vows? - Yeah. JANET: Here you go. Little Mermaid? - Thanks, Grandma! - Yeah. I think it's a little too small. You can use it as your goal dress. REBECCA: Mom. Sweetheart, no, no. We'll return it for the right size. 'Cause I'm sure that Grandma kept the receipt. (quietly): Yeah. And I think that you should try out for your school team; I think you'd be a natural. It's the third basketball that she's given him. - You realize that? - I know. I don't really play, Grandma, but... I guess I could try if you really want me to. Well, everyone should have something that they're really good at. RANDALL: You're gonna love bowling, Deja. Now, we are a family that falls on two sides of the lane bumper debate. I say, hey, they make us all better. Beth would disagree with that, but Beth ain't here, now, is she? - (laughs) Hey, let's take our shoes off so we'll be ready to give them to the cashier. I'm not giving somebody my shoes. But we have to rent bowling shoes, Deja. It's okay... They'll give you yours back as soon as we're done. Why would I want to wear somebody else's gross shoes? - No, no, don't worry. - Daddy, - I don't want to rent shoes, either. - Annie, please, not now. - Dad, come on, it's our turn to go. - Yeah, w... Okay, hey, uh... how about I ask them if you can bowl in your socks? - I'm not wearing socks. - You're not... GIRL: Bet her feet are nastier than her hair. What did you say? - Nothing. - No, I heard you. - I wasn't talking to you. - If you got something to say, you could say it to my face. Okay. Fine. Your hair's nasty. RANDALL: Whoa, hey. Deja. - Stop. - Hey, don't touch her. I'm sorry about that, man. She shouldn't have done that. - No, what the hell is your problem? - Come on, girls. - Let's go. - No, no, no, you don't just walk away. She needs to apologize. Excuse me, sir, would you back up, please? Are you all right, Maya? - Hmm? She hit you hard? - She didn't hit her. Okay? Your daughter was being a frickin' bully. Don't blame my daughter because you can't control yours. Bro, I think you need to watch your tone. - Did you not hear me? - No, brah, I heard you. You really need to back up right now. Look, if your daughter can't keep her hands to herself... I'm not his daughter. Come on, let's go. Let's go. ♪ SOPHIE (over phone): Honey, I'm so sorry I can't be there to help nurse you through your recovery. Yeah, no, you and me both; We could live out a very specific fantasy of mine. - Dude, she's a nurse. - You can live out that fantasy anytime. - Lucky me. Maybe I could get Brooks or Bishop to pick up my shifts this weekend. - No, it's okay. I've got my instructions from the doctor, Toby's here, Kate's here. They're gonna take care of me. I'm in good hands. (sighs): Okay. How's your pain? On a scale of one to ten. It's manageable, you know, but my needing to pee is about a    and a half right now, so I'm gonna let you go. - Okay? - Okay. If you need anything... I know, I know. You're here. I love you. I'll talk to you soon. - I love you, too. - Good-bye. - Oh, hey, Tobe? - Hmm? Will you be good with him for a while? I'm gonna try to make my yoga class. What? No. He literally just got out of surgery. You heard him, he's fine. Plus, I missed my workout this morning, 'cause we were at the hospital. Sorry. Are you kidding me? Go get the dress. Try it on. I swear it fits. - You know what, I'll go get the dress. - Tobe? - Yeah? - I'm not trying on the dress. - I'm going to yoga class. Kev? - KEVIN: Hmm? - I'll be back in an hour. - Okay. - Tobe's here. - Okay. - Love you. - KEVIN: You, too. Love you, Tobe. Love you. (door closes) Ah, maybe give her a break, you know? - She's got bat mitzvah jitters. - Yeah. Um... All right, it says you're supposed to... take these painkillers with food, so you want me to make you a quesadilla or something? - No, no, no, I'm good. I'm not taking those things. I took a couple of those when I first got injured, they made my mind all fuzzy, and I need to be sharp for this recovery. - Okay, um... - Oh, it's time. I'm gonna peel this sucker off right now. Uh, no, no. Don't. The nurse said that step one is RICE. - Yeah. All right? Rest, ice, compress, elevate. - In about... in a week's time, - (groans) I got to be parachuting down on a bunch of Nazis in Normandy, so this has to go quickly, you know? Don't worry. Trust me, Toby, I'm a champion when it comes to stuff like this. KEVIN:  Dad! Hey, Kev, you can't be scratching like that. - Wh-Where are your oven mitts? - They were too hot. Everything's too hot. You said the medicine would help. Yeah, well, it's only been seven minutes since you took it, pal. You got to give it time. It's gonna kick in and help, I promise. No, it won't! I feel worse than I did before. Kev, stop, stop. - Let go! I need to itch! - No. Look, being sick sucks. I know it, okay? I-I think you're making it worse on yourself by focusing on it so much. Hey, look, come here. Stand up. Come on, trust me. Stand up. (sighs) (roars) What are you doing?! Stop! You... are tougher than that itch. Look at me. You're stronger than that itch. You're not a mere mortal, son. You are a Pearson. Look at me. Now, let me hear your battle cry. - (roars) - (short roar) Do it like you mean it. From here. (roars) (roars loudly) (roars) - (roars) - There you go! Own that itch! Own that itch. Let me hear your roar one more time. (both roaring) Uh, please don't. Please don't. Grandma has a headache. Don't scratch that beautiful face of yours, Kevin. It's gonna take you far one day. Really? (crickets chirping) Baby, stop. - What? - Your internal meltdown is literally making the bed hot. Why did I think she'd like bowling? Well, who actually likes bowling? It was cool for a minute there when  The Big Lebowski  came out, but that was, like,    years ago, right? I meant go to sleep, but okay. I was so sure I had the right angle on this, Beth. We were gonna have fun, and then she would feel good, and we could talk. And instead I just made things a whole lot worse for her. Can't believe you were gonna throw down with some jackass in bowling shoes. - (sighs) I should've just listened to you in the first place. You knew. Of course you knew. You got the hygiene talk on lock. Right up there with... untangling necklaces and perfectly round scoops of ice cream. The trick is you just have to run the scooper under hot water first. - I know what the trick is, Beth. I'm just wallowing. Okay, I'm done. I'm sorry it didn't end up the way you wanted it. You should talk to her. I will. - In the morning. - Right. - Just let me hug you! - (Kate screams) - I need to get sick! - Leave me alone! Guys, enough! Guys! Stop! Hey, Randall, there are germs all over this house. You  will  get sick, you just have to be patient, okay? Why don't you go upstairs and finish your project before you get sick? - Good idea. - Whoa. Sorry, Grandma. - Okay. Wait, do you want to see my Rube Goldberg machine I'm building for the science fair? You knock over some dominoes,and then a race car goes down a slide and hits a marble. And then I haven't figured out the middle yet, but by the end, a marker draws a line on a piece of paper. Right. Well, why don't you show me when it works. Did you sauté the onions first? - I did. - How much thyme did you add? - 'Cause you don't need more than a... I did half a tablespoon. Well, you're gonna need more than that. Do you want to make the soup, Mom? - Sure. - Yeah? - I'm more than happy to help. - Thank you. Go for it. - I like your soup best, Mom. - Thank you. Well, your mother actually learned how to make this from me. I can teach you, too, if you want. A woman should know how to cook if she wants to have a husband and children of her own. - She's ten, Mom. - Well, Lord knows I wasn't the prettiest girl in Erie, Pennsylvania, but I somehow roped your father with the best pot roast and green bean casserole in town. - Did your mom teach you? - Yeah, she did. But this recipe right here actually comes from a maid that we had when your mother was a little girl. - You had a maid? Mm-hmm. A lovely black woman named Dora. Of course, I was always correcting her English, so that you girls didn't start speaking like street kids. - Jack? Where are you? - Dad's got a fever, too. - What? - Yeah, it-it... it just hit me. - JANET: Oh, God. - I thought you said you'd had the chickenpox before. (Groans) - No, I did. I did,  think. Probably measles. - Jack. - Oh, crap. Why don't you go upstairs and go to bed, Jack. We got everything under control here without you. Don't we, Bunny? ♪ You going somewhere? I pushed a girl, so you're kicking me out, right? You spent the whole night thinking that? We're not kicking you out, Deja. Honey, sit. Come on, Deja, bag down. - Please, sit. - (pats bed) You're right. We don't push other people in our house. You push somebody again, and you'll be grounded. But I hope it doesn't happen again. Is that it, then? Um... you know... I grew up with three very opinionated sisters and one  very  opinionated mother. Fights, arguments, cold shoulders, yelling matches... You name it, the Clarke women did not play. But no matter who wasn't talking to who, or who stole whose favorite tube of candy apple lipstick, we always came together to do each other's hair. Because my mom believed... Still believes... That... how you present yourself on the outside reflects how you feel on the inside. Look, I don't know why you're not washing your hair, Deja. But I do know we have to get it taken care of. So, if you don't want to do it yourself, I'm happy to take you to my salon. I love it there. It's really nice, and I spend way too much money there, and it's worth every damn penny. Let me know what you decide, okay? In the meantime, you can just go ahead and unpack. Will you do my hair? Brady, hey. What's up? Come on in. - Hey. Uh, it's from the producers. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just go ahead and, uh, put that on the counter there. Look at all that kiwi on a stick. You know I always say you can never have enough kiwi on a stick. (chuckles) They, uh, wanted to wish you a speedy recovery. - Well, that's nice. - I also have a hard copy of the revised script pages. Okay. Thank you. Cool. Well, I will, uh... I'll see you in a few days. - Yep. See ya. - All right. (paper rustling) ♪ Hey, Peter, it's Kate Pearson. Yeah, I'm excited about the gig tomorrow, too. Yeah. I-I just talked to Ms. Silver. She said we could set up at  :  . Yeah. Uh, and you're good for rehearsal tonight? Okay. Thanks. I'm just gonna comb you out a little bit before I wash it. Don't worry. I won't pull too hard. I promise. How long have you had these patches? You know, my sister Renee gets them, too. These areas where the hair doesn't grow. What she has is called alopecia. - Have you ever heard of that before? - No. It's not that uncommon in black hair. Some people are just born with it. It's not their fault. Oh. I didn't know that. Is it always like this? You know, it's okay to talk about it. It's just the two of us here. It gets worse when there's a lot going on. What do you mean? Like... Like, when bad stuff happens. When Mom gets in trouble. Or... when I have to move houses. That makes sense. Stress can make it flare up. My mom has really pretty hair. (clears throat) You know what? Over the years, I've gotten really good at braiding my sister's hair in a way that covers up her patches. After I wash you out, I think I can do the same thing with yours. Does that sound okay? JANET: Oh, I remember this trip. Your father took the twins and Randall out on the lake. - Remember? - No, Mom. It's not "the twins and Randall." It's "the kids." Or even just Kevin, Kate and Randall. Okay? - Are you okay, honey? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired. It's not just tonight. I mean, since I've been here, you haven't seemed like yourself. Is everything all right with you and Jack? Yeah. Never better, actually. Then what's going on? You don't call home much anymore, you stopped coming to see us for the holidays. 
 
 - (sighs) - You don't seem very happy. (chuckles): I am happy. - We're all very happy. - Okay. I'm sorry. I'm your mother, I'm allowed to worry. Who would've thought that Randall would be the one to get into private school. I'm sorry. What... what does that mean? What? Nothing. Okay. (sighs): All right. You want to talk about this? Um... Do you want to know why we don't come home for the holidays anymore? It's because of you. You constantly criticize my family. I am not a good enough cook. I don't clean well enough. Uh, Jack doesn't provide. You're gonna most certainly give Kate a complex about food. And Kevin is gonna think that his only value in life comes from how he looks. And all of that is fine. All of that I can sort of explain away to the kids, but... (sighs) But Randall... tries so hard to get you to like him. And, honestly, I've always wondered if the reason that you never bonded with him was because he was adopted. But you've made it alarmingly clear that it's because he's black. That is an appalling thing for you to say. You know, just 'cause he's black doesn't mean that he likes basketball. He likes football, like the rest of us, okay? And you got to stop constantly separating him from Kevin and Kate. They're all my kids, okay? I'm sorry, I call them "the twins." That's what they are. And Dora, our maid Dora, she wasn't just a child that you had to train how to speak, she wasn't. She was a   -year-old woman who had four kids of her own. I can't talk to you when you're being hysterical. And St. Mary's, right? We went to St. Mary's my whole life, and then suddenly at   , we switched churches because we got a pastor from Ghana. Oh, for God's sakes, I couldn't understand the man's accent, Rebecca. When the snow is gone, I want you gone, too. 'Cause I will not expose Randall to any more of this crap. What are you talking about? You're racist, Mom. You're a racist. Sweetheart. (sighs) Sweetheart, I thought that you were upstairs. I got my first chicken pock. Okay. All right. Um... (sniffles) Uh, let's take you back upstairs and I'll put some calamine lotion on, okay? TOBY: Hey, babe have you seen my... Holy hell of a hot fiancée. Wow. That looks great. I told you the dress would fit. Hmm? Yeah, you did. Hey. You set a goal and you made a goal, so now is the part where you get excited. What's going on with you? Nothing. Can you just unzip me? I have to meet my pianist for rehearsal. Yeah. How can Grandma be racist? She never says anything mean to me about being black. Yeah, that's-that's not always how racism works, kiddo. REBECCA: Yeah. Do you remember how we were talking about what Martin Luther King Day means? Someone shot him because he wanted to get black people equal rights. - Did Grandma shoot him?! - No, no, no, no, no. Grandma... mm. Look, you know how sometimes Mom gets really mad at me and she says some things that... aren't really nice but she makes it sound nice? Like, "Jack, I love when you leave your muddy boots in the middle of the living room." - Yeah. - Okay. So racism can sometimes be like that. You know, people don't actually say bad things to people that are different than them. - What they say sounds fine... - REBECCA: Mm. But there's this mean undertone to it, you know? I think I'm gonna go to bed now. (sighs) I mean, I said alopecia, and it was like no one had ever talked to her about it before. I honestly don't know what I would've done in that moment. They come to me for the boo-boo kiss, but they go to you for the Band-Aid and the boo-boo song. I don't know anyone else who has a three-verse song about how antibiotic ointment can help them heal faster. ♪ And prevent an infection disaster. ♪ That's the... They need the both of us. We make a good team. Nope. We were right the first time. (knock on door) Dang, girl. You look really cool. Alicia Keys cool. She's old. (laughs) Look, I... I just wanted to apologize for the way I acted at the bowling alley. I'm ashamed that I made a scene. I shouldn't have let things get so heated. Definitely not Alicia Keys cool. Still no love? All right. Anyway, um, I just wanted to say that... I've had two nervous breakdowns in my life. One right before Tess was born, and one just earlier this year. And they happen when I let myself get stressed out, and it just builds up inside, and then... (imitates explosion) But, uh, one of the things that helps me when I'm feeling stressed, though, is running. I run, like, every day. Just helps me clear my mind. So... if you ever feel like you want to, I would love to go running with you. She told you what I said? Oh. - Hey, Kev, do you... - (Kevin sighs) Dude, come on. - What are you doing? - What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm getting better. - No pain, no gain, right? - No. Actually, no pain, full recovery. Take your hand off that. No, no, no. Dude, come on. (chuckles) I hereby release you from all of your nursing duties. Okay? You can go back to your room and binge-watch The Handmaid's Tale  or whatever it was you were doing. - Handmaid's Tale? - What? Okay. Here. - (sighs) Come on, don't do that. Don't do that. You know what, I might not be your nurse, but I am your future brother-in-law, and I'm not gonna let you screw up your knee for the rest of your life. Well, that's really sweet of you. I appreciate it. But I'm not gonna let this stupid knee screw up the rest of my life. Not again. Again? What-what? Kev? Hey. Hey, just... - (sighs) - Would you just slow down? What's going on? Toby, I was three years old when I threw my first football. I made the varsity team when I was a sophomore. I wasn't good at football, Toby. I was great. My dad used to come to the games. He started taping them for a reel. Colleges were coming. They were scouting me. I-I had this whole future planned, you know. I... - And then the knee goes, and then bam, - (snaps) just like that, it's over in one second. Gone. (exhales) Wow. I mean, I knew you played high school football, but... Geez. So, what do you do, you know? I started acting, right? At first, I started doing it to, uh, sort of pass the time rather than just sit there and feel sorry for myself. But then, after a while, I-I started to... I started to get the same thrill from it that I did from football. And here we are, man. It's    years later. Right? I've been working my ass off, and I am finally on the brink of something special and real and fulfilling, and I will be damned if I let this stupid knee destroy another one of my dreams. And that is why you have to let it heal fully, all right? The... It's not that big a deal. The production said they would shift the schedule around for you. - They  did  shift the schedule. All right, apparently they can, they can shoot part of the Normandy scene without me... and Ron, Ron doesn't think it's a big deal if the other guy says, "I got you, Jimmy." Well, it's a big deal to me. And I-I appreciate all of your effort, all of your concern, but I'm not blowing this one. Okay, man? I'm not blowing it this time. I'm gonna do whatever it takes. - Hey. - Hi, Dad. - Hey. - Hi, Dad. When did you all get here? REBECCA: Kevin crawled in around  :  , and the others came not that long after. - Oh. - But you... you've been passed out with a fever for hours. I was getting worried about you. How are you feeling? Do you think you could itch my whole body? 'Cause I don't know that I have the strength. - I told you chicken pox is the worst. - Oh, yeah. Sure is, kiddo. Hey, babe, could you get me the Tylenol? I-I think I left it in the kitchen. (sniffs) Hmm. The kitchen, huh? That's downstairs. Uh, I have been avoiding going downstairs because my mother is down there. - Oh, babe. - But you are my husband, and I love you, and you're sick, so I will risk going downstairs and interacting with her. - Thank you, babe. - All right, guys. I'm gonna go downstairs. Uh, who wants something? This is your one and only shot. Hot cocoa. Cap'n Crunch. My Game Boy and some Cheetos. Wait, hold on a second. Has everyone been avoiding going downstairs? - Okay. I got this, Bec. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Lie down. I'm already going down. - Jack, you're sick. - No. We will not be held prisoner in our own home. I'm gonna get your mother out of here.

Thanks so much. - I will see you in there, all right? - Totally. Really appreciate it. Jack just finished digging out your car. So... I... You know, I didn't sleep at all last night. I was truly haunted by what you said to me. You have to understand, I grew up in a very different time. - In my day, people didn't... - Mom, I... Stop. (sighs) It's not because he's black. Or I don't know if it's adoption or it-it's just all of it. It just all feels really foreign to me, I guess. But I swear, Rebecca, I swear I try. You shouldn't have to try. (sighs) I know. But I do. REBECCA: Hey, sweetheart. Grandma wanted to say good-bye to you. It's nice to see you again, Randall. Okay. Wow. This looks impressive. I finally got it to work this morning when I switched this little marble for the heavier Super Ball. It's Newton's second law. You're a special young man, aren't you? Took you long enough. ♪ (sniffles) And me and Queen Latifah were looking everywhere for the puppies, but I woke up before we found them. RANDALL: Oh, that's too bad. I have to commend your commitment to your health. I can tell how seriously you're taking all this. Thank you. Oh, um... I bought the vitamins that you recommended. Are these the right ones? You know, it's just because... (sighs) my age and my weight, I want to follow the instructions. You're doing everything you can right now to stay healthy. Thanks. So, is it still there? It's still there. Your poppy seed is now the size of a lentil. Congratulations. You're officially six weeks along.
