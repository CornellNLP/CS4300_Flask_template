 Previously on This Is Us... 
 I love our life. I love it right now. 
 And I'm so scared of changing it. 
 I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us. 
 (crying): I don't want to be different from them. 
 Different from who? Who, the kids at school? 
 If I get an "A," I'll get ice cream, and Kate and Kevin won't, and then they'll hate me. 
 Kate : I can't fall for a fat person right now. 
 I guess I'll lose the weight then. 
 What did I do to deserve this? 
 You've done a lot of really nice things for me, so I wanted to return the favor. 
 By cutting up cardboard into little squares and putting it in a bowl? Yum. 
 Hey, so, Kevin, uh, it's been a few days now, you know, since you showed up. 
 Without calling. 
 Right. 
 I was just sort of wondering... 
 When you leaving? 
 Yeah.

 Jack : Ah, she's still got some life in her, at least six more cycles. 
 Rebecca : Jack, we have three infants. 
 We're gonna be doing six cycles by noon. 
 Jack? Yeah.

 What the hell, Kevin? 
 Turn the lights out, man, it's 2:00 a.m. 
 Damn it, Kevin, you ruined it. 
 It's all ruined. 
 Hey, man, I'm... 
 I'm sorry, dude. 
 Don't. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm trying to help you. 
 Look, I'm sorry I touched your precious woobie. 
 That thing reeks by the way. 
 It's the blanket I was left in, Kevin. 
 Well, it doesn't mean you can't wash it once in awhile. 
 What's your problem? 
 What's my problem? 
 Yes, what's your problem? 
 What's my problem? Dude, it's 2:00 a.m. and all the lights are still on! 
 Rebecca : Hey, guys. 
 What in the name of God could you possibly be fighting about right now? 
 He threw a football at my face. 
 He keeps waking me up. 
 Shh. 
 And I need to get sleep because I have a big game tomorrow. 
 Okay, Kevin, but Randall has a lot of homework, and now that he's on the football team, he has a lot less time do do it. 
 And why does he suddenly need to be on the football team? 
 What do I have to do with you guys? 
 Do I have to make you go sleep in separate rooms? 
 Yes, actually that'd be great. 
 No, Mom... 
 Okay, that won't work because the only empty room in the house is the basement. 
 I want it. 
 Kevin... 
 (sighs) 
 K... would you relax? 
 Hey. Dude, come on. 
 You don't have to go into the basement. 
 I'll turn off my light, and I'll do my homework in the kitchen. 
 That's a very nice offer. 
 Kevin, do you hear what your brother's saying? 
 Yeah, I heard him.

 Uh. 
 Morning, gentlemen. 
 Kevin : Hey. 
 Randall : Good morning. 
 Look at this, I got six miles. 
 Good for you, buddy. 
 Yup. 
 I did eight. 
 (Kevin chuckles) 
 Is William still asleep? 
 Yeah. 
 I feel like yesterday's chemo took a lot out of him. 
 Mm. Morning hugs! 
 Give me my morning hug. 
 No, gross! 
 Daddy, you're all sweaty. 
 Beth : All right, come on girls, backpacks, lunches, car. Let's go. I'll be right out. 
 Randall : Have a great day, beautifuls. 
 Daddy loves you. 
 Bye, Dad, love you. 
 Bye, kiddos. 
 Hey, Kevin. 
 Hmm? 
 Did you see a yellow legal pad in my office? 
 You mean my bedroom? 
 Do I though? 
 All right, I am gonna grab a shower. 
 Meet you at the office before dinner. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, he and I are having dinner tonight, so you have a Kevin-free evening. 
 Just the two of you? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Alone? 
 No, we're meeting our mother. 
 (chuckling): Oh, okay. 
 Why? 
 No, I just couldn't imagine you and Kevin hanging out. 
 What do you... Well, the guy lives in our house, Beth, we hang out all the time. 
 Yeah, but you guys are never in the same room alone together. 
 Uh, we just went for a run together.

 So, what this mean, "Really?"

 It didn't end well for Cain and Abel, baby, that's all I'm saying. 
 Well, we're not Cain and Abel. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, they were much less repressed. 
 But if we were Cain and Abel I'd be Cain, right?

 Toby : You just peed. 
 Every ounce counts. 
 That's true. 
 And I'm crushing this weigh-in. 
 Get it! 
 All right, Kate, are you ready? 
 I am. All right. Let's do this. 
 Oh, will you hold this for me? 
 Yeah. 
 (scale beeping) 
 All right. Congratulations, lady. 
 You are down a pound and a quarter. 
 A pound? 
 Yeah, and a... and a quarter. 
 And a quarter. 
 Okay, I kill myself for weeks, and I'm down a pound? 
 And a quarter. 
 Right. Yeah. 
 It's working, all right? 
 You got to keep going, though. 
 This is the tough part, but you got this. 
 Yeah. 
 Good job.

 Thanks. Nice work, nice work.

 Yup. 
 All right.

 Okay. Oh, wow. 
 You lost eight more pounds, mister. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 You know what that means? 
 Hey, guys, guess who just met their month goal? 
 This guy! 
 (laughs) 
 Nice. Hey, yeah, Toby, do you mind if we take a victory pic? 
 Oh, no, no, that's not necessary. 
 No, of course it is. 
 No, it's no biggie. 
 You hit your goal. 
 It's no biggie. 
 No. You are no biggie... anymore. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm proud of you, Toby. 
 Go, give 'em what they want. 
 Okay, all right. 
 Uh, I'll do the... I'll do the victory photo. 
 Woman : Yes, let's do it. All right, we're doing it. 
 Woman : All right, guys, let's get in here. 
 Toby : Victory photo. 
 Woman : Come on, circle it up. 
 All right, one, two, three. 
 Toby : Ah! 
 All : Cheese! 
 Toby : Cheese! 
 Woman : Super cute. Another one. Smile! 
 Yes! Beautiful! 
 Randall : I want to make a big push on rising temp futures. 
 Some of our clients don't currently believe in science, but we'll have 'em watch an Al Gore documentary once the cash starts rolling in. 
 Am I right, people? 
 Come on, guys, nothing? That was... 
 Is that the Manny? 
 Yup. That's the Manny. 
 I'm early! 
 Right. 
 I'll be right there. (clears his throat) 
 You guys look sharp. 
 (woman laughs) 
 I'll meet you in the... meet you in the office. 
 Okay. Cool. Just chill out in your office? 
 Yeah. 
 That is the Manny. It is. (laughing)

 Yeah, but it's my first rehearsal in ten years. 
 You're gonna do great, babe. 
 (clears throat) 
 Hey, uh, what are you planning on wearing to the boy's game tonight? 
 Because I know we usually wear Kevin's colors, but now that Randall's playing for another school... 
 The game. Crap. 
 Um, I'm meeting Bob Parrish tonight to close the Doylestown deal. 
 Doylestown? 
 Yeah. 
 Really? So you got it? 
 I-I told you last week. 
 Well, I'm sure I would have remembered if you said that. 
 Oh, I know that I did. 
 Okay, well, is there any way that you can move the meeting because that coach is coming to scout Kevin? 
 It's a really big game for him. 
 It's a big day for me, too, and a big day for you. 
 And a big day for Kevin, so... 
 (sighs) 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Jack? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 I'm all over the place. 
 Have a good day. 
 Have fun. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 Randall : No, of course. 
 Hey. 
 I totally understand. We can do dinner another time. 
 That was Mom? She's not coming? What'd she say? 
 Yeah. Well, tell Miguel I hope he feels better soon. 
 Let me talk to her. Is Miguel sick? 
 Let me just talk to her real quick. 
 Yeah, I'll tell Kevin. 
 Just give me the phone. 
 Just put her on speaker. 
 We can reschedule. 
 Just let me talk to her before you go. 
 Love you, too. Bye. 
 Before she... Let me talk to her for... 
 Oh. It's Miguel's gout. 
 Really? I didn't know they made gout anymore. 
 Yeah. 
 So she's not coming then? 
 No. 
 Not coming. Oh, okay. 
 (exhales) 
 It's the two of us. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, if you got work to do though, I... we don't have to go. 
 No! 
 I'm, I'm okay. 
 You're all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, if you've got lines to learn or something, then we can... 
 I'm good. I'm up to speed, so... 
 You and me. 
 You and I. 
 Beth : Hey, girls, wash up and come down. 
 So, Kevin and Randall are out tonight. 
 It'll just be you and us ladies. 
 Nothing for me, thanks. 
 (coughs) 
 You know, my dad had cancer. 
 Lung. 
 I didn't want to say anything 'cause, you know, it wasn't exactly a happy ending for him. 
 Endings rarely are. 
 Weed helped. 
 With the appetite, you know? But... 
 I just figured with your history, I didn't want to bring that up because of... 
 No... Marijuana doesn't have the same kind of trigger. 
 Even my doctor said. 
 Hmm. 
 Can't have you going out in the night scoring drugs on my account. 
 What... what if I was to tell you I had a little stash? 
 Then I'd say, woman, you surprise me. 
 And I'm not easily surprised. 
 How about I feed the girls, right? 
 Get their asses in bed, and bake us up some special brownies. 
 I like that plan. 
 You like that? 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah. 
 Right. 
 Hey! How are you? 
 (shouting): What do you think? This place is great, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. The last time I was here, I bro'ed out with Mario Lopez. 
 I don't know who that is. 
 Oh, okay. (laughs) 
 Oh, my God. We love you. 
 Yeah? All right, well, cool. Let's, uh... do a selfie. 
 Give it to me, I'll take it. 
 No, no, it's a selfie. 
 It's a thing. 
 Right. Got it. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Kevin : That's gonna turn out great. 
 Thank you. (giggles) 
 I'm suddenly getting why we came here. 
 What'd you say? 
 I said I'm su...

 So, he's got a piece of egg salad sandwich dangling from his mustache, riding me about how I don't take my job seriously. 
 Yeah. 
 Eventually, I just had to walk out while he was talking.

 All right, all right. 
 Hey! 
 Boys! 
 (whistle blowing) 
 ♪ Come talk to me... ♪ 
 Hey. Hey, come on, Kev. Would you stop? 
 No, it's all right, Randall. I'm just gonna go back to my hotel. 
 Leave me alone, all right? 
 Look, hey, I'll give you a thousand dollars right now if you can tell me what I do for a living. 
 Uh, you're a Wall Street guy, right? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Okay, but what does that mean? 
 Uh, you know, you do the-the... the... like, The Big Short. You do the Ponzu schemes. 
 Oh, dude, it's ponzu sauce, Ponzi schemes. 
 Whatever. 
 Look, the point is, you don't know what I do, and that's fine. 
 What difference does it make if I didn't watch The Manny? 
 You hated the show! You were so ashamed of it, you quit. 
 Not at first. At first, I was proud of that show, Randall. 
 And I invited every single one of you to tapings. Kate's the only one that came. 
 Well, she had to. You were paying her. 
 Come on, dude. That was funny. 
 What are you... ? 
 (Randall laughs) 
 Now that... that is funny. 
 That's great. 
 Replaced by another black man. 
 What the hell did you just say? 
 No. "Replaced by another black man." 
 Hey, you tell me what that means. 
 Don't worry about it, Randall. 
 No. Please, Kevin. Let's hear it, right? 
 What are you harboring? 'Cause God knows I would really love to hear this. 
 You always got special treatment. 
 Because I'm black? 
 No, because you're black and you're adopted. 
 Oh, yeah, hit the jackpot with that combination. 
 Couldn't have had it any easier. 
 In our house, you did. 
 With our mother, you did. 
 Oh, right. 
 Okay, here we go. 
 Why can't you just admit it, man? 
 Admit what? 
 Just admit that you were more important to her, and that she wanted to make sure that you felt special every single minute of every single day so that Yeah. 
 You wouldn't feel like the odd man out. 
 Well, gee, Kevin, I wonder why she was worried about me feeling that way? 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 Just go back to your hotel. 
 No. No, hold on. 
 Randall, hold... No. What does that mean? 
 It means you treated me like a dog. 
 And just like a dog, I kept coming back again and again, just hoping for a scrap from you, like a crumb of affection or kindness or respect. 
 Respect? You wanted my respect? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, okay. No, you wanted to show me up, Randall. 
 Which is what you did every single chance you got. 
 No, I did not. 
 You showed me up! 
 I'm done with this conversation. 
 Done with this conversation? 
 In any other family, I would have been the star! 
 Yeah, you know what, bro? 
 You're no star. That is a star. 
 Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me. 
 You don't push my body. 
 Don't touch me, okay? Don't touch me. 
 What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? 
 Oh, my God. Don't put your hands on my body. 
 (indistinct grunting and mumbling) 
 (groaning) 
 Is that... is that the Manny? 
 Ow! My face... 
 Kevin? Hey, Kevin? 
 You're all right, man? 
 Hey, Seth. 
 Do you... want me to call someone? 
 Oh. Oh, it's, uh... 
 (camera shutter clicks) 
 No. 
 This is my brother. 
 Oh. Hey, man. 
 Hey, Seth Meyers. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 (distant siren wailing) 
 No. You know what? Let's go. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm still black. Come on, let's go. Yup, yup. 
 (grunts) Let's get the hell out of here. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't help more with moving the heavy stuff. 
 That's okay. 
 Did you know I grew up in a house with 14 people in it? 
 Hmm. 
 My parents, four siblings, aunts, cousins, three bedrooms. 
 How many bathrooms? 
 One. 
 Oh, my gosh, when I was young, all I did was dream of living alone. 
 Like some hippie life, you know? 
 (chuckles) 
 Like in some artist loft downtown. 
 No husband. 
 Definitely no kids. 
 So what happened? 
 I met your damn son. 
 (laughs) One look in his eyes, he ruined everything. (laughs) 
 Me, I pretty much always lived alone. 
 Hmm. 
 Now I have Randall. 
 And you. 
 And the girls to fall asleep to, wake up to every day. 
 I hope that's a good thing. 
 Mostly. 
 Makes me feel sad to die. 
 I love it when there's a new moon like this. 
 "Splendid against the night, the searchlights... 
 Both : ... the tracers' arcs, and the red flare of bombs." 
 How do you know that? 
 It's in this book of poems that Randall's had since he was a baby. 
 (chuckling): Oh, yeah, that's right. 
 The one I gave Rebecca back in the day. 
 Oh. 
 What? 
 What'd you say? I'm feeling a little tired, Beth, I think I'll... 
 Oh, hell no, you ain't cancering your way out of this one, old man. 
 (William stammering) 
 You better talk. 
 (warning beeps) 
 (door chimes) 
 (alarm chirps) 
 (plastic bag rustling) 
 (rustling continues) 
 (sighs) 
 Get your asses in the car. 
 We're gonna talk big-time at home. 
 (engine starts) 
 You're right. 
 Mom did favor me. 
 She did. 
 Showered me with attention. 
 Took my side more often than not. 
 And I ate every bit of her love up. 
 Ate it up like Pac-Man. 
 (laughs softly) 
 You know why? 
 Because the one person I wanted it from the mo... 
 You know, back there with those people, it's the first time in 36 years you've said the words, "He's my brother." 
 Come on, Randall, that can't be... 
 Claiming me. 
 My brother. 
 Well, then, that really sucks. 
 Rebecca has known who you were for Randall's entire life? 
 Yes, that's right. 
 And she never told him? 
 I don't know, Beth. 
 Lied to him, when he asked. Huh. 
 I got to tell him. 
 No. No, no, no, no. 
 Beth, you can't do that. 
 Oh, "Beth you can't do that"? 
 This is my husband. 
 This is my marriage. 
 I know, but the closeness he has with his mom, you tell him this, it'll destroy it. 
 (door closes) 
 Whoa, someone's high. 
 Good night. 
 Night. 
 Good night. 
 Uh... 
 You and my wife got high together? 
 That's pretty cool. 
 (chuckles) Good for you. 
 All right, I'm gonna head up to bed. 
 Not that way; she moved you. 
 What do you mean, she moved me? She moved me where? 
 (sighs) (laughs) 
 Oh, back in the basement. 
 No, we'll move you back upstairs. 
 No, come... hey, listen. 
 I should be getting out of your hair soon anyway. 
 You know, until then, this is actually a pretty sweet set-up. 
 There's no bathroom down here. 
 I can walk a flight of stairs. 
 (sighs) Well, uh... (clicks tongue) 
 It's been a day. 
 Yeah. 
 Night. 
 Night. 
 Hey, uh, Randall. 
 Hmm? 
 Uh, do you want to... 
 Do you want to hang out down here for little bit with me? 
 We could, uh, turn the TV on or something. 
 Uh-huh. For a little while. 
 Yeah? 
 Why not? 
 Cool. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, Rebecca, this is Beth. 
 Yeah, um, so William just told me something really interesting about the two of you. 
 So, yeah, I'm gonna need you to call me back, okay? 
 Right away. 
 As soon as you get this message. 
 Okay, bye.
