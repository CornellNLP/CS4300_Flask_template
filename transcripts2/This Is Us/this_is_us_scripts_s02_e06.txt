 We lost the third baby, Jack. 
 I'm-I'm very sorry. 
 Previously on This Is Us... 
 BECCA: He pushed... a stranger on me. 
 And that stranger became my child. 
 And that child became my life. 
 He became you. 
 Eight years ago, I was pregnant for the first time, and Randall was vying for partner at his firm. 
 And he made sure I didn't lift a finger. 
 And then, one morning, I was in the bathroom, and he... called out to me. 
 He was confused, because he... couldn't see anything. 
 No, the kids are gonna be fine. 
 We're their parents, Bec. 
 We do the best we can. 
 But at the end of the day... what happens to them, how they turn out... that's bigger than us.

 RANDALL: Jimmy said that his mom's handing out pennies this year, so tomorrow we'll skip them and go straight to the Baileys. 
 They have full-size candy bars. 
 Okay, Mr. King of Pop. 
 - Can you try this on for me, please? 
 - Thank you. 
 We don't need a map. 
 We're not gonna get lost trick-or-treating in our own neighborhood. 
 It's not about getting lost, it's about maximizing our house-to-candy ratio. 
 - Mom. 
 - BECCA: You know what? 
 If he wants to use a map, he can use a map. 
 - Hey, Bug, here you go. 
 - RANDALL: What are you doing? 
 - Try that on, please. 
 - RANDALL: Stop. You can't draw on it. 
 And then, here is your stethoscope, 'cause I think vets use stethoscopes, right? 
 - I don't want to be a vet anymore. 
 - What? 
 - Why not? 
 - It's not pretty. 
 - I... 
 - JACK: Hey, hey, sorry I'm late. 
 - BECCA: Hi. 
 - Hey. 
 Who wants to carve some pumpkin corpses? 
 (evil laugh) Mwah. 
 - Daddy. 
 - JACK: Yeah? 
 Do I have to be a vet? 
 I want to be Sandy from Grease. 
 - Pretty Sandy, not tough Sandy. 
 - Okay. 
 Yeah, you can be pretty Sandy. 
 Mom can handle that, right? 
 Jack, I just finished her costume. 
 - Well, I... 
 - KATE: I can use my yellow sweater. 
 JACK: Hey. She can, she can use her yellow sweater. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 Oh, and Kevin's doing his cigar-smoking bum again. 
 Oh, yeah. That's his ultimate fantasy, no chores and nothing tucked in. Jack... 
 Oh, hey, Randall... yeah? 
 Check this out. 
 I've been working on something for you. 
 Ready? Here. 
 Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Whoo-hoo! Ooh! 
 - (laughter) - Really, Dad? 
 - JACK: Okay. Yes, really. 
 I'm gonna go change, and then we're gonna carve some pumpkins, okay? Get 'em ready. Line 'em up. 
 - Hey. 
 - Huh? 
 Jack. You... 
 You have to stop doing that, with Kate. 
 Doing what? 
 Saying yes to anything that she wants. 
 - Oh, come on. No, I don't. 
 - You do. 
 - It was a costume, Bec. 
 - Jack. 
 What-Whatever-whatever makes the kid happy. 
 You cannot bear to see her disappointed, can you? 
 (laughs, snorts) 
 - What was that? 
 - Nothing. 
 No, you made a... (snorts) 
 You made some sort of sound. 
 I just don't know what that's supposed to mean. 
 I just... 
 I find it funny that you're accusing me of being too easy on Kate when you treat Randall like a glass figurine. 
 Uh, I do not. 
 - Okay. 
 - No... 
 Mm. No, we're not... 
 I'm not letting you reroute the conversation, Jack. 
 You realize, that by saying yes to everything that Kate wants, it's not preparing her for the real world. 
 - Okay. 
 - No, no. High school and college and her   s? Oh, my God, her   s are gonna be nothing but noes. 
 Hang on. Didn't I say yes to you in your   s? 
 - Wait, you said yes to me in my   s? 
 - Yeah. Sure did. 
 - Are you kidding me right now? 
 - No, I... 
 - Yeah. 
 - (laughing): No way. 
 I don't think you're remembering your   s. 
 Oh, I remember my   s. 
 - You clearly don't, Jack. 
 - No. 
 I remember my   s. 
 - Yeah? 
 - Did a lot of this. 
 Uh-huh. 
 - All that, oh, my gosh. 
 - I do remember that. 
 There was so much of that going on in our   s. 
 JACK: People don't forget their   s.

 Uh-huh. 
 Flight    . 
 Okay, he'll be in baggage claim. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, Rebecca. 
 I'll see you in a couple of hours. 
 Oh, and thank you. 
 I'm so glad you're gonna be here. 
 Yeah, my mom is coming as soon as she gets over the flu. 
 It's been a rough couple months. 
 Um... 
 Better, I think. 
 You'll see when you get here. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 All right. Bye. 
 (exhales) 
 Okay, did you need anything else, or...? 
 - WOMAN: No. 
 - Uh... okay. 
 Just the check, please. 
 Your favorite customer is here. 
 Hey. Can I get you some coffee? 
 Uh, yeah, if it's hot. 
 Yeah, it was, it was just brewed. 
 - How's the pressure? 
 - Hmm? 
 Too hard, too soft? 
 - MATRON: No, you can go harder. 
 - Yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. You got a future here, Kevin. 
 You're gonna be cutting hair in no time. 
 Nah. Nah, nah, nah. 
 I'm just, uh, here till pilot season starts. 
 - Mm. 
 - Yeah. 
 I-I know what you're thinking. 
 You're thinking, "That's what he said last year," right? 
 About, you know, only being here till pilot season starts.

 Come on, damn it. 
 Nope. Not gonna get me. 
 Round six. 
 Here we go. 
 So, you're early, but it's Friday, so, uh, tuna melt? 
 Extra onions, well-done fries? 
 (laughs) You know me too well. 
 Stay. 
 Talk a while. 
 Okay. 
 So, what's new? 
 You trick-or-treating tonight, or...? 
 No. No, I'll be at the, uh, the South Hills Lounge, buying my guys some drinks. 
 What about you? Party on campus? 
 Uh, it's night school. 
 So, there'... there's no parties or a campus. 
 - (both laugh) 
 KEVIN: 'Cause everyone's like, "Hey, anyone ever tell you you look like Tom Cruise?" or, "Hey, you're like a young Tom Cruise." 
 "Oh, you're like a, you're like a young Tom Cruise, but tall." 
 You know what I mean? And then, all of a sudden, everything slows down, right? Because they're like, "Well, I don't know. He's a little too Tom Cruise." 
 Or, "He's like Tom Cruise, but he's too tall." 
 And I'm like "Guys, hello! 
 I can act shorter. 
 - But no one's got an imagination... 
 - Kevin. 
 - Too much pressure? 
 - Too much whining. 
 Okay. Sorry. 
 I broke the damn fan. 
 Oh. Baby, it's October. 
 We don't need a ceiling fan in the nursery. 
 No, no, we need air circulation, Beth. 
 That's what they say crib death is, you know, little pockets of trapped air that get stuck in the baby's throat, and they wake up in the night and... 
 You know what we don't need to talk about right now? 
 Crib death. 
 It's in none of the books under suggested topics for the day before delivery. 
 You're right. 
 - Sorry. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 Hey. Did you eat anything today? Hmm? 
 You know what the doctor said about blood sugar levels and mood... 
 Okay. 
 (candy clattering) 
 These are fun-size, Beth. 
 I wanted to be the house with the full-size candy. 
 And the wife who's not worried about her husband. 
 I'm not worried about you, baby. 
 You know, it was two months ago, okay? 
 You're good. We're good. 
 You know what, I just got to get this fan thing off my mind. Sorry. 
 (grunts) It's gonna be okay, sweetie. 
 Hmm? 
 He's gonna come through. 
 He always comes through.

 BECCA AND JACK: Ta-da! 
 RANDALL: I don't get it. 
 What?! We're Sonny and Cher. 
 Who are they? 
 You don't know who Sonny...? 
 ♪ I got you, babe ♪ 
 - ♪ Hey, I got you. ♪ 
 - Oof. 
 No, that was Cher 'cause 
 I think you sound great. 
 Great, it sounded like Rebecca. 
 Okay, guys, let's go. 
 This is stupid. 
 I don't want to use Randall's weird map. 
 I want to go to the Johnsons' haunted house first. 
 No, we have to use my map to get to the good candy first, then we go to the haunted house. 
 Okay, so how about we vote? 
 - Map or haunted house? 
 - No, no, no, no. 
 - Haunted house! 
 - No map! 
 RANDALL: No fair! Mom promised. 
 KEVIN: Aw, don't be a baby. We voted. 
 - RANDALL: No! 
 - Kev... 
 RANDALL: We'll spend too much time in the haunted house. 
 I planned everything so perfectly! 
 Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Randall, it's fine. 
 It's fine, okay? 
 We'll use the map. 
 - I did promise him, Jack. 
 - Okay. 
 Why don't you take them and I'll take him? 
 And we'll be done by... 
 Look,  :  , Eastern Standard Time, okay? 
 And then we'll meet back up with you guys. 
 Yep. Great. Okay. Uh, guys, get your pillow cases. 
 Go. Come on. Randall, get your pillow case. 
 BECCA: Okay. Go, go, go. 
 This is exactly what I was talking about earlier. 
 Jack... 
 No. He's too rigid and it's getting worse. 
 No, no. He's not rigid. He's anxious. 
 Mom, come on, come on, come on. 
 We're late. 
 - Look, Jack, I did promise him. 
 - Yeah. Go. 
 Okay, uh,  :  . 
 I'll be the one with the wig and the devoted fan base, okay? 
 - Mom, come on. 
 - I'm coming! 
 - JACK: Wait, wait a minute. 
 With-Without you, I... 
 What is my costume? 
 Great. So, I-I'm Rhoda. 
 I'm Rhoda with a mustache. 
 - Come on, Dad, haunted house! 
 - Yep. Haunted house! 
 Haunted house! Here we go. 
 (children laughing) 
 Perfect. 
 - Dude! 
 - Hey. 
 Dude, I booked the Christian Bale movie. 
 - What?! 
 - Yeah. 
 How did the... Wow. 
 That's... congratulations. 
 You know, that's-that's-that's just...good for you. 
 No, it's good for both of us, dude. 
 Don't even worry about paying me back for rent last month, okay? 
 Because this is all thanks to you for encouraging me and all. 
 Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I say nice things to you, you say them back to me. 
 That's the arrangement, right? 
 Yes. So, Brett, the director, invited me to a private party with the cast tonight and you got to come with. 
 Oh, no, dude, that's your fast lane now, man. 
 - That's-that's your thing, I'm... 
 - No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Come on, you are so talented. 
 This is gonna happen for you. It is. 
 You just need some introductions, okay? 
 Please. 
 You know what, the hell with it. 
 Let's go. 
 - Yes. 
 - Yeah. 
 Home, baby. 
 Hey. 
 (laughing): Hi, Rebecca! 
 - It's so good to see you. 
 - Oh, there she is. 
 Oh, it's good to see you, too, sweetheart. 
 BETH: Oh, how are you? 
 - BECCA: I'm hanging in there. 
 - BETH: Yeah? 
 Oh, you look wonderful. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 You're a good liar. 
 - Ah, not lying. 
 - (laughs) 
 Hey, babe, why don't you take her luggage up? 
 - On it. 
 - Thank you. 
 You're welcome, Ma. 
 - He looks good. 
 - Yeah? Really? 
 - You think so? 
 - Yeah. Yeah, I do. 
 I... I think he looks a little tired, but that's to be expected, right? 
 - I'm really glad you're here. 
 - Me, too. 
 It's been stressful with the baby due and-and, just in case... 
 - I know. 
 Yeah, I know. I know, I know. 
 Well, I'm glad to be here. 
 - Oh, my gosh, babe. 
 - Ah! 
 - Hey. 
 - I was just telling your mom how I haven't seen my feet in months. Yeah. 
 You know, you two are really loud whisperers. 
 You haven't quite got that down yet. 
 So, I'll tell you what. 
 Uh, I'm gonna leave. 
 I'm gonna take that fan back and get a new one, and you guys can talk about me as loud as you want, but when I come back... (sighs) 
 ...let's be normal. 
 All right? 
 - Baby. 
 - Hmm? 
 It's Halloween and it's getting dark. You really want... 
 I can drive three miles to the hardware store, Beth. 
 Oh. Yeah. Of course. Here. 
 - Let me move my stuff for you. 
 - BETH: Uh-huh. 
 Look, that way this fan thing won't be hanging over my head. 
 Or it will be hanging over my head. 
 See what I did there? Fan joke. 
 I'm gonna go. 
 - You see what I'm saying? 
 - Yeah, I do. 
 KEVIN: It's too crowded. 
 Let's come back later. 
 KATE: No, he said he'd be here. 
 Do you see any Ninja Turtles? 
 Wha... Wh-What do you mean, who? 
 - Who's he? 
 - Billy. 
 - Who's Billy? 
 - There's one! 
 Kev, wh-what's going on right now? 
 She's gonna ask Billy Palmer to go through the haunted house with her, and if it gets scary, he might hold her hand. 
 She has a crush on him. 
 Come on, that's ridiculous. She's ten. 
 It's ridiculous because he's Billy Palmer. 
 He's almost as popular as me, and no way is he gonna hold her hand. 
 Can I just go trick-or-treating on my own now? 
 Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. 
 Just, hey, houses I can see, Kev, and then you come right back. 
 - Okay! 
 (music playing faintly) 
 Hi. 
 Uh, they canceled class tonight, so I thought I would take my new costume for a spin. 
 It's "Nervous Girl Taking a Chance." 
 (both laugh) 
 Well, I'm glad you're here. 
 - You are? 
 - I am. 
 Can't you tell from my costume? 
 "Guy Who's Happy to See You." 
 (chuckles) 
 I was hoping it was "Guy Who Buys Me a Drink." 
 (chuckles) 
 Uh, I was actually leaving, so... 
 Oh. Yeah, that-that... cool. 
 Can we go someplace quieter? 
 Yeah, I live nearby. 
 Oh, okay. Look. 
 - There he is. There he is. 
 - Oh, yeah. Look at that. (chuckles) 
 You know what I love? 
 I love how everyone's just all of the sudden decided that he's the man, you know? 
 - Yeah. 
 KEVIN: He's, like, barely done anything. 
 ZEKE: Yeah. Totally. 
 You want to meet him? 
 - Hell yeah. Huge fan. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Brett. 
 - Oh, there he is. 
 - Here's our Jason. (laughs) 
 - How are you? 
 Hey, man. 
 Hey, this is my friend, Kevin Pearson. 
 - He's an actor, too. 
 - Hey. How are you? 
 It's an honor to meet you, sir. 
 You know what I loved... 
 BRETT: Hey, man, you killed it today. Come on. 
 - Laura wants to talk to you. 
 - Oh. 
 - She thought you were great. 
 - Oh. Oh, my God. 
 Great. 
 We've changed, you know? 
 - We're so polite. 
 - Hmm. 
 We tiptoe around each other like strangers. 
 And it's hard for me to tiptoe right now. 
 Then don't. 
 He's a lot stronger than he seems. 
 You didn't see him. 
 You did not see him that morning, Rebecca. 
 Just blind and weeping and a million miles away. 
 Hmm. 
 And has it happened since? 
 No, not so far. 
 He says it's fine, but I just... 
 I don't believe him anymore. 
 You should. 
 You know Randall. 
 When he gets knocked down, he gets right back... 
 - You weren't there. 
 You're right. 
 You're right, I-I wasn't there. 
 You know, my friends are telling me that I need to join something called Facebook? 
 To see, uh, all the-the baby pictures you're gonna post. 
 Oh, no, don't even bother. 
 I'm not gonna be one of those moms who posts a picture every time a baby burps, okay? 
 They say that it's-it's a good way to-to, um, stay connected and feel part of a community. I don't know. 
 I could help you set it up. 
 - Yeah? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, okay, I would like that. 
 I'll try it. 
 Cool. 
 - Hey, sweetheart? 
 - Hmm? 
 You're gonna believe him again. 
 RANDALL:  :  . 
 - Right on schedule. 
 - Yeah! That's great. 
 Hey, hey, hey, but let's, uh, let's go to to this house. 
 That's the Larsens. 
 Nah, they talk too much and they make you do tricks, like hopscotch. 
 Yeah, but it's gonna be really quick because there's no one waiting in line over there, so let's go. 
 Mom, it's because they always have licorice and-and... 
 Let's just stay on my map, okay? 
 Hey, hey, Randall. 
 The plan is not set in stone. 
 We can change it. We can... we can improvise. 
 - Do you know what that means? 
 - No. 
 It means when you make something up in the moment and it can be a lot of fun. 
 Can you try it for me? 
 Just take one minute. 
 Fine! 
 BECCA: Okay. 
 Can I help you, sir? 
 What? 
 Oh, yeah. Um... 
 I need, uh... 
 Sorry, uh, this doesn't work. 
 I can get you a new one. 
 It's for the baby. 
 I got a baby coming tomorrow. 
 Oh, congratulations. 
 Uh, okay, well, let me just see which... 
 I had a breakdown a couple of months ago. 
 You know, nervous, mental, whatever you want to call it. 
 And I'm not the same, you know? 
 Like I was. 
 And I know it. 
 And my wife knows it, too. 
 (Randall exhales) 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Thanks, man. 
 See, that morning, uh, the morning that I had the thing, I was on the Internet. 
 This site: "Where Your Baby Is Now." 
 And at six months along, they start dreaming. 
 You know that? 
 Before that, it's all cells and parts, you know, but then they actually start dreaming. 
 And that's a person, right? 
 A whole little universe of hopes and dreams and happiness and sadness, and I just thought, whoa, I... I can't be in charge of a universe. 
 I can't even hang a ceiling fan, turns out. 
 I don't have any answers, except at work, but at work if I'm wrong, it's just money. 
 But what if I'm wrong with a baby? 
 Why are you asking me? 
 That. 
 And if it's not racist, the turban. 
 Eastern wisdom is kind of a thing, right? 
 Oh, yeah, East Trenton. 
 (Randall chuckles) 
 I will tell you one thing. 
 I have five kids. 
 And before the first one was born, I was all questions, too. 
 Can I? Will I? 
 (exhales) 
 But what they don't tell you is that babies come with the answers. 
 They come out, they look up at you, and you at them, and... 
 ...they tell you who you are. 
 You'll see. 
 Tomorrow you'll have all the answers you need. 
 Huh. 
 That's pretty good for East Trenton, excuse me. 
 Oh, man. (sniffles) 
 What's the "G" stand for? 
 Garuda. 
 Damn. 
 Almost had a baby named after me until I said that, didn't I? 
 Best fan on the market. 
 Grab one. 
 I'll meet you at Returns.

 - Mm.

 What? 
 No, no. No, we're inducing tomorrow. 
 This isn't supposed to happen until tomorrow.

 I've called    , but the roads are blocked for Halloween. 
 So just get home as soon as you can.

 It's a great party, man. 
 This is awesome.

 (whistles) Blew me away. Awesome. 
 - Thank you very much. 
 - Yeah. 
 - All yours. 
 - Oh, thank you. That... 
 Are you, uh, are you casting any more projects at the moment or...? 
 No, I just like to cast one movie at a time. 
 - Funny that way. 
 - Right. 
 (chuckles) I-I get it. 
 Uh, that-that character Jason, I'm-I'm in love with him. 
 - I love it. 
 - Well, it's nothing on the page compared to what your friend does with it. 
 Yeah. Yeah, no, he's great... 
 I'm just, I'm... 
 Well, I was just curious, uh... 
 I mean, it's an interesting choice, you know, going with Zeke. 
 Well, because the character's described like this all-American, handsome guy, right? 
 And Zeke's more, uh, he's like... 
 I mean, come on, he's like a character guy, right? 
 Just, uh, I'm-I'm curious if you read any actors, you know, like the character was described? 
 You mean like you? 
 No, I... I'm-I'm just, 
 I'm-I'm, I mean I could... I could come in and I could, I could read it for you. 
 You know, just so you get an idea of what it feels like, you know, as it's... written. 
 Or not. 
 You know, I don't have to do any of that... 
 Look, Zeke's obviously the right choice. 
 He's-he's the right man for the job, and I-I just, uh... 
 - Congratulations on... 
 - Wow. (chuckles softly) 
 You know, I-I thought I had you pegged already. 
 - Uh-huh. 
 - You know, pretty boy, big deal in high school. 
 Actor, waiter, talent optional. 
 There's a thousand of you guys out here. 
 But what I never 
 figured you for was this. 
 A guy that would steal his friend's part. 
 I... I don't know... I wasn't... 
 You will never work for me, buddy. 
 Not in a movie. 
 Not even carrying a tray.

 JACK: Come on, Billy. Don't be a jerk. 
 Please don't break my little girl's heart. 
 (man cackles loudly) 
 (wolf howls over speakers) 
 - How'd it go? 
 - It was awesome! 
 He held my hand really tight when the goblin jumped out. 
 Well, of course he held your hand. 
 - (Kate giggling) 
 - I mean, this-this is the most adorable hand in Pittsburgh. 
 Next to your other equally adorable hand. 
 I mean, really it's a tie. (chuckles) 
 - I got to tell Molly. 
 - Yeah. Go... go tell Molly. 
 (sighs): Oh. 
 I'm gonna go with my friends. 
 JACK: Hey, Kev, come here. 
 Come here. 
 Did you just give Billy your candy so that he'd hold hands with your sister in there? 
 I can always get more candy, Dad. 
 It's easy. 
 Can I go with my friends? 
 - Yeah. Go ahead. 
 - Thank you. 
 Excuse me, have you guys seen Cher? 
 No? Cher? Okay, thanks. 
 Hey, Randall. 
 Randall. 
 Randall, stop! 
 What? I did the Larsens' house. 
 I improvised like you wanted without my map. 
 Now can I just go home? 
 No. No, come here. 
 I want you to sit down. 
 Please. I want to talk to you. 
 Hey. What is going on? 
 You always talk to me. 
 What's wrong? 
 Did you and Dad lose the baby and just couldn't find it? 
 What? 
 That's what the Larsens said. 
 They said I was a miracle. 
 Because you had three babies and you lost one and got me instead. 
 (sighs): Oh. 
 (whispers): Randall. 
 We-we didn't lose him. 
 Not like that. 
 He didn't... 
 He didn't live. 
 Sometimes that can happen. 
 Sometimes a baby dies... right in the beginning. 
 But your dad and I had all this room in our hearts for three babies. 
 And we saw you. 
 We met you. 
 So, yeah, you are a miracle. 
 But you're not "instead" of anything. 
 You are the way it was always supposed to be. 
 What was his name? 
 Kyle. 
 Kyle probably looked like you and Daddy. 
 And them. 
 Nobody looks like me. 
 I know. 
 Hey, this wasn't some big secret we were keeping from you. 
 We always, always planned on telling you. 
 We were just waiting until you were old enough.

 Yeah. He would have.

 Thanks.

 Married, huh? 
 Yeah. But he's nice, which makes it harder. 
 He asks questions. 
 - He knows my class schedule.

 You really haven't had an audition in six months? 
 No, it's been more like a year, actually.

 I mean, what are you... 
 You still sitting in your car, eating fast food, staring at where the house used to be? 
 He's gone. 
 Okay? And he's not coming back, and even if you sit there in the exact same spot that you were when he left, he's not...coming back. 
 I know.

 Not if there was nothing for you there. 
 You know what he'd want for you? 
 Hmm? 
 Everything. 
 Yeah, for you, too.
