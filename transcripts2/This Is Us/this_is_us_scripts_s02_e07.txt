 I haven't had a happy life. 
 Some would call it sad, but I don't. 
 Why did you choose to get drunk? 
 You embarrassed me in front of my friends. 
 Deja, your mom might not be coming back for a while. 
 What do you mean? Yes, she will. 
 I'm pregnant.

 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 - Nice to meet you. 
 - Hey. Come on in. 
 - How are you? 
 - Thank you. Very good. 
 Okay. Right here is where the babies sleep. 
 We got Randall right here, next to Kevin and Kate. 
 REBECCA: And we are absolutely getting a changing table in case you're wondering, which obviously, you are, coming to check on prospective adoptive parents. 
 - I'm gonna stop talking. 
 - Yeah. We're really excited.

 - So excited.

 Evening, Jack. Just wanted to stop in for a quick little checkup on Randall. 
 Come on in. 
 Kevin just about bit my freaking nipple off. 
 JACK: Hey, look, it's Paula. 
 - Hi, Paula. 
 - Hi.

 Oh, he's good. He's great. 
 Hi, Paula.

 This is leftover from yesterday. 
 Now, we don't usually give Randall too much sugar. 
 I just figured, for a first birthday... 
 Rebecca, your kids can have birthday cake. 
 I won't hold it against you. 
 - Okay, thanks. 
 - So, the judge, 
 he has all this paperwork? 
 Yes, along with my glowing recommendation. 
 Now, this next part is just a formality. 
 You'll go before Judge Bradley, and he'll ask you a few questions, like, "Do you wish to adopt this child?" 
 - And you'll say, "Yes, we do." 
 - (LAUGHS) 
 - We need to commemorate this moment. 
 - No, babe, 
 - I-I don't think we need anymore... 
 - We need pictures. 
 - We need new pictures.

 No, they're for our adoption notice for our son, Randall. 
 Bet you can't guess which one Randall is.

 - PHOTOGRAPHER: Sorry. 
 We don't get a lot of families that look like yours in here. 
 Either you're blown out, or Randall's a dark blob.

 JUDGE CROWDER:  The court accepts your guilty plea, Mr. Hill. 
 And since you are unable to post bail, you'll be remanded until your sentencing hearing. 
 Do you understand? 
 You have no record. 
 Not so much as a traffic violation. 
 So, I must admit, I find this arrest rather disappointing. 
 What would you have me do, Your Honor? 
 On every corner, there's someone selling, so I buy... and I use. 
 If you had my life, you'd probably use, too. 
 Just a year ago, my mother was alive, and my girl was alive, and we were having a son. 
 Now, they're gone. 
 - They're all gone. 
 - Mr. Hill... 
 So, I come here, and you tell me you're  disappointed? 
 Well, guess what? 
 I am more disappointed. 
 I am the most disappointed man you've ever met in your whole damn life. 
 So, if you want to lock me up, lock me up. 
 Put me inside, because there is nothing out here for me anymore.

 Because it's not fair, Beth. 
 I mean, Deja's    years old, and I got to take her to visit a woman who thinks it's perfectly fine to drive her daughter around with an unlicensed gun in the glove compartment.

 Do you even want to move out here? 
 What? Do I want to... of course I want to move out there.

 You wonder if... 
 Randall, last month we got a girl who had an ear infection when she was an infant. 
 - Just a minor little ear infection. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 Totally treatable... except her birth parents didn't treat it. 
 They ignored it for six months, and now she's four and she's deaf. 
 Do you know how hard it is to find someone who'll take in a deaf four-year-old? 
 Do you know how many times I have held up a photograph of her and shown prospective foster parents, and I've watched their faces light up? 
 And then I watched those smiles disappear when I tell them she's deaf. 
 Do you know how to say, "Sorry, sweetie, we still haven't found a family for you," in sign language? 
 Because I do. 
 So, please... don't tell me you wonder if anyone's out there looking out for these kids. 
 I'm sorry, Linda. 
 Did Shauna say why she didn't want to see her? 
 No.

 Um... could I go get my purse? 
 Yeah, we can get it on the way back. 
 No, I need it now.

 Yeah, we're going to. 
 No. Let's just go to the courthouse and get married. 
 Really? 
 Why not? 
 Nothing about our relationship has been traditional. 
 I proposed to you when I thought you were unconscious. 
 You know, we decided to have a nice, long engagement, to slow things down, and then boom! 
 You knocked me up, so... 
 Are you for real? 
 Let's get married. 
 JACK: Your Honor... 
 Randall has been with us for over a year... 
 Look, let me save you some time by being direct. 
 I don't believe that child belongs in your home. 
 - What? 
 - Excuse me? 
 That child belongs with a black family. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Pearson, how else... will he see himself, understand who he is? 
 (STAMMERS, EXHALES) 
 'Cause we will... teach him all of that. 
 JACK: Yeah. 
 - You will teach him? 
 - REBECCA: Yeah. 
 Mrs. Pearson, I was nine years old before I understood that I was black. 
 Now, I understood my skin color, the color of my friends and my parents, but I never really understood what my blackness meant until a white man called me a nigger. 
 And my father sat me down, and he explained to me what that word meant. 
 He didn't... sympathize or feel sorry for me, because he understood all the pain that that word elicits. 
 My father had been called that word more times in his life than he could count. 
 Now, you see, what you have in your possession is a black child who will grow up to become a black man, and my fear... is that he won't have the tools he needs in his life if he stays in your home. 
 I'm... I'm sorry, sir. 
 With all due respect... to your opinion, our son was left in a box outside of a fire station... 
 And there are places, and there are people who will care for him until he can be paired with a suitable family. 
 Now, that's my opinion. 
 It will not change. 
 Now, I said that this is... inappropriate. 
 I will see you at your next court date. 
 If you're going for a more vintage vibe, rose gold is very "right now."

 I'm a famous person, Roger. 
 Yeah, just, you know, show me the diamonds. 
 Let's see the goods. 
 Ooh, that's good. 
 This is... this is like something my dad would do after he messed up with my mom. 
 He would... do something big like this, something romantic. You know? 
 Well, proposing is definitely romantic. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, all our selections are conflict-free. 
 Well, uh, Sophie will love that. 
 That's good news. She hates conflict. 
 You know. Hates it. 
 I haven't exactly been the best boyfriend lately, but I think... 
 we're gonna be fine. 
 - I'm sure you will. 
 - Yeah. 
 I really love her. 
 I'm sure you do. 
 You know what? We're gonna do all three. 
 Okay? I'll just get these three; we'll let her decide. 
 I'll just wrap this up. 
 CLERK:  So, after I issue you  the marriage license, you come back here tomorrow for the ceremony, bring a witness, and whoosh, you're married. 
 "Whoosh"? What is that, the sound a marriage makes? 
 It is here. 
 TOBY: I never imagined getting married under so many fluorescent lights. 
 Yeah, but think of all the money that we're gonna be saving. 
 And all the other wedding crap that we get out of. 
 - Totally. 
 I don't have to go wedding dress shopping.

 We'll just be in and out in... 
 Your Honor, what is this meeting? 
 I didn't know we'd be having any kind... 
 I wanted a word with Mr. Hill, before his sentencing, in private. 
 Sir, I can't advise my client to waive his rights to speak to you or... 
 It's okay. 
 I'll be right outside. 
 I gave a young man ten years today. 
 Younger than you. 
 He stole a TV. 
 Ten years for stealing a TV. 
 It wasn't even a good TV. 
 I didn't want to do it, just like I didn't want to give five years to a different fella yesterday,    years to another guy the day before that. 
 I'm a judge, and the strange thing is... I don't make the rules. 
 So, round and round it goes. 
 I know the ending to each one of those stories. 
 And they haven't even been written yet. 
 I'm here, Mr. Hill, because you said something yesterday, and it stuck with me. 
 You said you were the most disappointed man in the world. 
 And I'm here to tell you, I fear I am a close second, Mr. Hill. 
 Because I'm the man who writes terrible stories day after day, and I can't change the endings. 
 And that, sir, is a horrible... disappointment. 
 So, I want to see if we can find you a different ending here. 
 I'm gonna take a chance on you, get you out, get you help. 
 I don't expect you to be perfect. 
 I know you'll make mistakes, just like the rest of us. 
 But I will ask one thing of you. 
 (QUIETLY): Yes, sir. 
 I want you to look at my face. 
 I want you to look at this too tired, too old, too fat face. 
 Lock it in your brain. 
 And if you ever start heading toward the ending I don't want to write, I want you to picture this ugly old mug. 
 You picture this face, and you make a different choice. 
 Can you do that? 
 Can you find me a different ending to your story? 
 (QUIETLY): Yes. 
 How is she? She say anything? 
 Not really. 
 She just wanted to go to sleep. 
 You should've seen her today, Beth, with that little purse. 
 I mean, when she handed over her allowance... 
 - This mother's a real piece of work. 
 - Right? 
 I mean, first she abandons her daughter. Right? 
 Then she lets her get tossed from group home to group home. 
 She's been abused, neglected, and who knows what else. 
 And then she doesn't even bother to show up for the visit? 
 - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
 - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
 We're not letting her go back over there. 
 Well, hold on, now. 
 These are court-ordered visits. 
 I don't give a damn about a court order, Randall. 
 I am done letting that woman hurt that child. 
 Okay, wait. 
 I thought I was gonna be the one bringing the heat here, and you were gonna calm me down, so we switching places? 
 Yeah, we switching, okay? 
 Because it's our job to protect that little girl, so we gonna do our job. So that means, as long as she's under this roof, she's not gonna have anything to do with that woman. 
 - You could've moved in with Natalie. 
 - WOMAN: No. 
 - JUDGE JUDY: In any event... 
 - TOBY: Mm-mm. 
 Nope. Not gonna do it. 
 I am not having a conversation about this with you, sir. 
 It's not happening. 
 It is weird enough that you live on the mantel. 
 Yeah, it would've been nice to get your permission or-or get your blessing, the right way. 
 FYI, I would have crushed proposing to your daughter, by the way. 
 I'm the king of romantic gestures. 
 I hear that we have that in common. 
 That and our insane good looks. 
 Okay, but here's... 
 See, here's the thing. 
 Kate loves weddings. 
 All right? She watches  Say Yes to the Dress  with her special  Say Yes to the Dress  notebook, like she's studying. 
 Yeah, my BS meter is going off, too, with this whole courthouse thing.

 Thank you for seeing me. 
 I'm... 
 I'm Deja's foster father. 
 I needed to explain... 
 I didn't want her to see my face like this. 
 I wanted to explain to you that what happened yesterday was very difficult for Deja. 
 She was disappointed. 
 She was really looking forward to seeing you. 
 When you make a commitment to a child, you got to stick to it. 
 Well, next time I'll reschedule getting jumped. 
 Well, obviously, I'm not familiar with... 
 No, no, please, continue. 
 You seem to know all about my situation. 
 Deja's doing well. 
 She gets along with my wife and my daughters. 
 They're close to her age. 
 We're thinking of enrolling her in Woodside Middle School. 
 Last foster parents let her stay at her old school. 
 She's got friends there. 
 She's on drill team. 
 Woodside's an excellent school. 
 I'm sure the cheerleading squad there is pretty great. 
 (CHUCKLES) You got a white wife? 
 Excuse me? 
 Cheerleading is not drill team. 
 I know the difference. Thank you. 
 And don't get it twisted, sis, I wake up every morning next to a head scarf and coconut oil. 
 I'm married to a black queen, not that it's any of your business. 
 You know what? You made the choices that got you in here, but your daughter is a child, and I don't think you know the half of what she's been through because of you. 
 So you don't need to be worried about me or my wife. 
 You need to be focused on what's best for Deja. 
 Oh, let me guess. That's you?

 You know, that's not the first time I've heard that. 
 "I'm on the other side of the glass." 
 My ex Lonzo said that same exact thing sitting right there where you are right now. 
 - Is he...? 
 - No. He's not Deja's father. 
 He took off when Deja was eight. 
 Mm-mm, Lonzo is the fool who got me in this mess. 
 Met him in rehab when I was trying to get right. 
 Ain't that something? 
 Trying to get right, and I get Lonzo. 
 That's unfortunate. 
 I wound up on this side of the glass, yeah. 
 And you wound up over there, no doubt 'cause things broke your way. 
 Don't you dare say I'm in here by choice. 
 People who have choices say that mess. 
 Deja's the one good thing I've done. 
 And I thank you for watching out for her, but make no mistake, all right, you can give her your money, and you can give her your cheerleading, but I gave her my blood. 
 And if you want to know what's best for her, it's me. 
 And the second I get out of here, I'm coming back for her. 
 You gonna have to go through me. 
 I've been through worse.

 REBECCA:  Dear Judge Bradley, I noticed you had some photographs of families on your wall, so I thought I'd send you ours. 
 Randall is my son, whether you approve or not, whether you sign a paper or not. 
 And, yes, certain things are harder for us. 
 Family portraits, for instance are... (LAUGHS) 
 ...not our strong suit. 
 Exposure is tricky for the Pearsons, so we make do. 
 But the thing you need to know about us is that the Pearsons keep at it. 
 We don't stop. 
 So, I suggest you put us up on your wall. 
 Maybe it will help you get used to our faces because we will keep coming until you do your job. 
 Sincerely, Rebecca Pearson, Randall's mother.
