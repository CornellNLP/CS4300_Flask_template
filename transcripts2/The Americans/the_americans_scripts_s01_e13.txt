 Previously on The Americans... 
 Zhukov is dead? Who did it? Grannie : The CIA Director of Planning for the Soviet Union, Richard Patterson. You gave me Richard Patterson's name. I let him go. You're not the only one who loved Zhukov. I don't believe you ever had a relationship with Zhukov. I can help you, and one day you will help me. Exfiltration. One step at a time. We're just starting out here. You don't want to be married to me? I don't think the Centre would even care. We know that we're looking for a Caucasian man and woman, a couple. I recruited somebody-- a colonel in Air Force Intelligence who works in the anti-ballistic missile program. This colonel is way up the food chain. A meeting has been set. A trap is always a possibility. But in this case, it's worth the risk. There's one move we could make. We put a bug in Gaad's office. Martha could do it. No knock on your charms there, Romeo, but there's no way she'll go for that. I pronounce you man and wife. Elizabeth : You and I were never really married. I know they're just words people say. Do you think things would've been different between us if we would've said them? [ Siren wails ] Grannie : Prince was arrested. Failure to pay child support. How many days before the feds start looking into an incarcerated Department Of Defense employee with a high-level security clearance and a felony charge hanging over his head? Even if the meeting wasn't a setup before, it's insane to go into it now with Prince in custody. He could be broken with a feather duster. I don't understand. It's just child support. Stan : I know. And, look, I'm new to Counterintelligence, but would you believe that they've actually had foreign intelligence services target people who are behind on child support? I mean, where these foreign countries even get that information, I have no idea. - Jesus. Anyway, that's how a guy like you ends up here. I'm not saying it's fair. Yeah. [ Sighs ] I'll probably lose my security clearance over this-- getting arrested. You don't have to worry about your security clearance, Sandford. I'm gonna get this all cleared up, have you out of here in an hour. Sound good? [ Indistinct conversations ] Something is wrong with that guy. I don't know what exactly, but he's holding back. You want to go back in, push harder? You know, I told him he'd be out of here in an hour. Let's just let him sit there. No one goes in. At some point, he's gonna start shouting at the glass that he wants to talk. [ Moaning, screaming ] Oh, I love you. Oh, I love you. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Both breathing heavily ] [ Chuckles ] Martha, I will never forget tonight. Me either. [ Sighs ] My husband. [ Sighs ] My Clark. [ Sighs ] Do you like wallpaper? Huh? Well, I know you won't be here seven nights a week, but you'll be here a lot, and we're making a home. I want it to feel like yours, too. So, I thought we might redecorate a bit. I think this place is perfect. Mm. Mm. [ Sighs ] I ordered you eggs florentine. Are you ready to meet with the colonel tomorrow? I'm ready. But when someone appears suddenly, promises big intel, and sets their own meeting, I worry about a setup. Do you have any new information on the Prince situation? Our contact in the DC Police says he's been moved into federal custody. You have a right to be worried, but this is what we're here for. I know what we're here for. Good. Another thing-- we had an intercept last night. There's going to be a meeting between Weinberger and James Baker at Weinberger's home office. It was set up in a hurry and flagged "Top Priority" by the White House. The Centre's worried that Reagan may be planning a covert strike against a Spetsnaz detachment in Nicaragua. They wouldn't discuss it on the record in the Pentagon, but they want Philip to pick up the recording of the bug and get it to them ASAP. I will let him know. They also informed me that you and Philip radioed a request for my reassignment. Well, that couldn't have come as a shock. I had to fill out an "officer in the field" special-request assessment form. It has 27 sections. Well, I guess your job can be dangerous, too. My point was, you've been in the field too long. You've lost touch with both your basic obligations and the central rules and regulations that make this organization function. It's happened before with officers in your position, and it can be remedied. I'm sure they'll send someone else to remedy it. Don't be sure. I've been serving faithfully much longer than you, my dear. I told them they're in danger of losing you. And whether you see it or not, I'm right. I'm surprised they gave you this job, when you have no understanding of people at all. I know you better than you know yourself. Mm. And you don't know  me  at all. Well, you should be heading home soon. I'd stay out of my way if I were you. [ Typewriter clacking ] [ Copy machine whirs ] The meeting tomorrow with the colonel is on. Prince is in federal custody. If it wasn't a setup in the first place, what are the odds of him keeping his mouth shut? [ Sighs ] I listened to the Gaad bug last night. And? Three times yesterday somebody knocked on Gaad's office door to say they had an update, and three times he said, "into the vault," and then footsteps as they walked out of the office. Could be them setting us up with the colonel. Or could be them running any one of their other operations. Yeah. If this goes bad, you need to be out of town somewhere with the kids. It goes like this-- they let the meeting run so they have tapes on me for my trial. Then they swoop in, arrest me. Maybe they rip the disguise off me then, maybe wait till the interrogation later. Normally, we'd have a couple of hours, maybe days, before they ID me. But now we have till Stan Beeman gets his first look at me. You have to be already gone. Get the kids to Canada. Contact the Rezidentura there. That's fine, but you have it backwards. I'll meet the colonel. You take the kids, get ready to move. You'll be doing something else. There's a meeting at Weinberger's tomorrow. The Centre needs the tape. Okay. So, you grab the tape, pick up the kids from school, wait someplace safe while I meet the colonel. [ Clatter ] [ Sighs ] I know what you're trying to do, but listen to me. If one of us is going down and one of us is staying with the kids, Philip, after everything... it should be you. That's not true. I  want  it to be you. You're the one they want. [ Sighs ] The one they understand. Don't argue with me. Just say yes. It's for all of us. No. The colonel is my mission, from  my  agent. It's what the Centre ordered. The bug's receiver is in that car. We think, in the trunk. How do we know it's that car? We turned the bug on for two minutes, traced its signal, and that's where it landed. How do they listen to it? They either sit in the car, or they pick up a recording and take it home with them. What, they just leave the car there? Probably switch it out from time to time. They turn it on remotely when they want to record something from the study, then come by and pick it up. Good. We've arranged for Weinberger and Baker to have an actual meeting in the Weinberger study tomorrow. We also made sure the KGB heard about it, along with the word "Spetsnaz," which is all it takes to drive them crazy. Given how important this bug must be to them, they would never risk exposing it by sending a Rezidentura officer to pick up a recording. They know that we follow them around day and night. That means they should be sending in a Directorate "S" illegal. We'll be waiting. [ Doorbell rings ] [ Sighs ] [ Indistinct talking on television ] Hey. Hey. I'm sorry I'm late. Henry doesn't want to go with you guys tonight. [ Sighs ] Why not? Hey, buddy. You don't want to come have dinner with us? No. It's game five of the Stanley Cup, and the Islanders  just  got a goal. Oh. I don't want to miss a thing. Hi, dad. Hi, honey. Hey. How are you? Good. Good. You know what? Why don't I stay here with you guys and watch the game? Really? Cool. Yeah. I'll make something to eat. Great. Scooch. [ Exhales sharply ] I think this is gonna work, sir. Gaad : I know. After we get the illegals, the Rezidentura is gonna go ape sh1t. We need to do right by our source. I'll talk to the Deputy AG... as soon as we pull this off. Oh, come on. Really? Announcer :  ...into the crowd. Face-off will be in the New York zone. You all done? Oh, I'll grab these. Jackson holds the... Thank you. [  Announcer speaking indistinctly  ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] Did you pick a hotel? Yeah. The Melton Inn, Tuscarora State Forest. I already packed their bags. They're in the garage if you have time to put them in the car tonight. If they freak out about the surprise family getaway, just say we all need a little spontaneity in our lives. Where are you dropping the tape? They're picking the car up from the usual garage. If I make it out of the meeting with the colonel, I'll be there by nightfall. We'll have a great weekend, back home by Monday. Yeah. If not, we're still on the same page? I take them to Ottawa and contact the Rezidentura. I know it's not what any of us think is ideal. But there aren't a lot of choices then, Philip. There's one other choice we can make right now because who cares what the Centre ordered? All they care about is that both missions get done. I will take the colonel. You pick up the tape... Philip-- ...because Paige and Henry need you. They love you. And I-I get it. I get it. You see us together, and you think, "it seems easy." That's not it. You're their mother. I know that. Right. [ Sighs ] We have to follow orders. No, we don't. Philip, please. Don't fight me on this. Okay, fine. I w-- I-I won't fight you. I'm headed home, guys. Aw! Henry : I love you, dad. I love you  more. I love you more. Got to dig a little deeper. Take a look at the last page. That  is our own private cabana. Eight days. Stan-- and your mother already said that she would stay with Matthew. I don't want to go on vacation. Sandra, look... you know, I've been working on this case, and it's been-- it's been terrible. But tomorrow it's gonna be over, behind me. I swear. And I know-- I know-- how many times do you have to hear this same old sh1t? I know that. Whatever has happened between us is my fault. But I want to make it better. I do. If you don't want to go to the beach, I understand. But sometimes, you know, a little bit of sun, a little bit of ocean... It looks nice. It is. Expensive. Philip got us a rate. [ Sighs ] I appreciate what you're trying to do. I do. But no. It's not gonna fix anything. [ Sighs ] Sorry. [ Dog barking in distance ] Man : Can I help you? Oh. I'm Lori's aunt, from 3d. And I'm staying with her, and I'm locked out. Um, Lori's on her way to her brother's, and I need to call and tell him to send her back so she can let me in. Could I possibly use your phone for a second? Uh, listen, uh, I've had some problems. Um, why don't you let me make the phone call for you? Of course. I'm so sorry to trouble you. Here's the number. Uh... thank you so very much. Sure. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. Of course. Hang on just a second. [ Clears throat ] Your nephew wants to speak to you. Oh? Oh. Oh, thank you. No, no, no. I'm so sorry to disturb you. It's right there, around the corner, to the left. Okay. Oh! R-Robbie? Oh, I feel so stupid. Yeah, I-I got them from her, but I-- I left them on the counter. I know. [ Laughs ] Ugh! [ Taser clicking ] [ Groaning ] You won't be able to move for 20 minutes... [ Groaning softly ] ...which is 10 minutes longer than you have left. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Groaning continues ] Viktor Zhukov was my friend. We met in Stalingrad in 1942. He was ragged, skin and bones, same as we all were. First time I saw him, he was standing over two dead Nazis. [ Groaning continues ] I was surprised, after the war, that he'd survived. We found ourselves working together in what was then called the NKGB. [ Groans lightly ] 
 
 Henry? Hmm? I had a nightmare. Paige, I'm sleeping. I'm gonna wake up mom. No. You're not allowed, and you know that. Mom? Mom. What are you doing? I, uh-- I couldn't sleep. What are  you  doing? Laundry. Why are you down here? I wanted to get a glass of water. Oh. You're doing laundry in the middle of the night? I don't hear the washing machine. I was folding. Why don't you go back up to bed, sweetheart? Baker leaves the White House in 90 minutes. His limo will pull up with two Secret Service cars trailing. The meeting with the Secretary of Defense should last approximately 45 minutes. Now, I think it's safe to assume that, given the level of security, they'll come pick up their recording afterwards. Okay, I want everyone in place starting right now. [ Sighs ] The Centre wants you in Moscow Tuesday. You're being reassigned. I'm sorry, Claudia. In my day, they didn't coddle you. You'll finish the assignment? Of course. Do you expect any problems? Not from them. But as I've been telling the Centre all along, every instinct I have is crying out that this is a setup. This is what you think? It is. But sometimes the Centre sees a pot of gold, and they can't keep their hands in their pockets. You should get Philip and Elizabeth out of this, Arkady. They just stabbed you in the back. You care so much about them? So long as I still have this job, I'm responsible for my officers. You're  responsible for them, too. This is happening in one hour, Claudia. It means I would have to abort the mission on my own. You have that authority. I do? When the Centre has been this clear and there is no new information? Besides, if you're wrong, we'd be giving up the greatest intelligence success since we got the atom bomb. That's what we always say right before our people die for nothing. The next thing we always say is, "It was  so  obvious." [ Telephone rings ] Mr. Philip, I have the singles resort itinerary up on the screen. It wants approval, hmm? All right. [ Keys clacking ] Big news? What big news? I want you to stay here for the next few hours, and then-- then I'll tell you everything. They expect me back. I can't stay. You're not going back. I can't tell you all the details right now, but in a few hours I'm going to have some very, very happy people at the FBI. And they're going to approve your exfiltration. Just like that? Just like that. It's time, Nina. My God. Aren't you happy? Of course. I-- I-I just... You didn't think I'd come through. I knew you would. Listen, Nina, they're gonna want to send you out west 'cause your people don't have any resources out there, but-- but there are different cities, different places you can choose. Mm. We won't see each other. Probably not for a long time. But you're gonna be okay, Nina. I told you I'd get you through to the other side of this. Where's Philip? Oh, he said he had to run. Uh, and he wanted me to give you this. Thank you. [ Door closes ] [ Door closes ] I have meetings. I'll call in later. Okay. See you tomorrow. [ Van door opens ] How we doing? Everyone's in position. Meeting's about to take place. Okay. I'll be on radio. By the way, Brenn called. That guy Prince-- he started shouting at the glass. And? He wants immunity and 500 grand. For what? We'll find out when he gets immunity and 500 grand. You sure he's not bluffing? The guy's a gambler, but I don't think he's a bluffer. We should make the deal. Okay. "Very, very happy people at the FBI"? Hold, everybody. Hold. She's a resident. She's a resident. Future's bright, don't you think? Good lord, is that  really what I asked you to say? Forgive me. I was in a hurry. Sit. So, I hope I don't seem rude. In fact, it's out of appreciation and gratitude that I'd like to keep our meeting short today-- safer, basically. Let me just say, our technical people said what you sent us was incredible. It  is  incredible-- from the Latin "incredibilis," "in" meaning "not," "credible" meaning-- well... Your message said you had something vital for us, something from the president's anti-ballistic-missile program. I'm giving it to you now, but you're not hearing me. The technology-- it's  incredibilis. [ Chuckles ] At best, it's 50 years from being remotely operational. The damn thing's a fantasy. Well, if that's true, why the commitment from the Reagan administration? The hell if I'm supposed to know that. Some people say the President only hears what he wants to hear. Some say it's all one big psyop, a way of getting the Soviets to spend themselves into oblivion, trying to keep up with a technology that will never pan out. And really, that's just what the world needs, isn't it? Another crazy arms race, but this time in space. [ Engine turns over, tires screech ] [ Tires screeching ] What the hell's going on? What are you doing? You got the emergency abort signal. It's a setup. It's not possible. Who did you tell? We didn't tell anyone. Calm down. I don't think you did, either. I saw the signal. They wouldn't send that out unless this was a setup. There's nobody here. This isn't the setup. Elizabeth. [ Tires screech ] [ Horn blares ] We got another woman approaching the car. We have another woman approaching the car. Everybody, hold. Wait for the moment. I don't want anybody moving until someone opens that trunk or gets into that car. This could be it. This could be it. What the hell? It's a couple. Phillip : Get in! Go! Go! [ Tires screech ] It's them. Take them. Take them! Get the backup moving. Hold on. [ Tires screeching ] [ Tires screech ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Tires screech ] God damn it! [ Tires screech ] [ Siren wailing ] Get in the cars! Get in the cars! Go! Go! [ Siren wailing ] [ Tires screech ] [ Horn blares ] [ Tires screeching ] Block off Moore at the 320 intersection. No, Hennig, go left on Lincoln from 320. [ Wailing continues ] [ Tires screeching ] Shut down Eastern Avenue at the Takoma Metro. [ Horn blaring ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Siren wailing ] Okay, Second Unit, Second Unit southeast on Fenton. Balducci, Balducci, 8th Street northeast. Check the north side of Van Buren. [ Siren wailing ] [ Engine shuts off ] You get the prints. I'll get the car. [ Thudding ] [ Engine sputters ] [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] [ Siren wailing ] [ Siren wailing ] We should still take the kids to that hotel tonight. Really? It'd be nice. What's wrong? Okay. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. It's okay. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! Nina? Nina? [ Keys clatter ] I took a bath... to start my new life. What? It didn't work out, Nina. It all fell apart. I can't. I can't go back there, Stan. I'm sorry. I don't know what I-- I thought it was... I'm gonna take care of this for you. I am. Just... not yet. Shh. It's okay. I know. I know. I know you will. I know. I know. You should go home to your children. I'm not leaving her. She's gonna have to stay here with us a very long time, Philip. I'm  not  leaving her. Her great aunt? Had she been ill? Uh, no. She fell down the stairs. W-we don't see her much, um, but Elizabeth's the only relative she's got. So we're driving up now, and I-I think Elizabeth may stay up for a while and take care of her. Okay, well, we'll watch the kids. Don't worry about it. I really, really appreciate your help. Anytime.
