 Previously on The Americans... 
 All you have to do is put the clock back. I don't have to listen to you. I listen to my lord. No! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm in love with you. And I would do anything for you. What was so urgent? Mom, daddy, I'd like you to meet Clark. Hi. Gaad : It's a studio. It's time you and your source started having your meetings in a safe house. You don't want to be married to me? I don't think the Centre would even care. Dad is going to be staying somewhere else for a little while. This is your fault! You're always giving dad a rough time! Who the hell are you? A friend of Adam Dorwin, who recruited you. I was very fond of Adam. I can't say the same about you, Sandford, since we've only just met. Who killed Vlad? I don't know. There's a team at Livermore Labs. They've had a breakthrough. It's only a matter of time. [ Mid-tempo rock music plays ] I don't like surprises, Sandford. Well, you'll like this one. Waitress : Hey. You want something? Guinness. Hm. I recruited somebody-- a colonel in Air Force Intelligence who works in the anti-ballistic missile program. You did what?! I did it the way Adam Dorwin recruited me. I spent a lot of time talking to the guy, built up a bond of trust, et cetera, et cetera. Dorwin did not recruit you on his own. He followed our instructions, every step of the way. Listen, listen, this colonel is way up the food chain. He's got incredible information. Did you see it? Some of it. Show it to me. I don't have it on me. It's for sale. By who? Well, it's his information, but I'm the vector. You want it, you got to go through me. How much? 50 grand. [ Scoffs ] We playing at the big-boy table now, Sandford? I swear this is great stuff. Here you go. How do you know we can trust this colonel? Prince : He's hit the wall. He's completely disillusioned with the chickenhawks in the Reagan administration. It's a gold mine, I'm telling you. We'll see. You want it or not? $50,000 buys a lot of poker chips. If your information's as good as you say it is, you'll get your money. But I need to know what I'm buying. Signal me once you load in what you've got at your dead drop site. Then we'll talk. Gamblers are unreliable. The Centre never should have okayed Prince's recruitment. True, but all his intelligence has been good. Yeah, so far. If Prince really did recruit an Air-Force colonel, it would be our highest-level source ever in Reagan's missile-defense program. Or he's setting us up. Did you talk to Paige? About what? Having dinner at my place. Um... Yeah, it's fine, of course. Great. She said you put some stuff up on the walls. Just a calendar. Oh, you need to make her another set of keys to your place. Why? Henry took the set you gave her and buried it in the backyard. Won't tell us where. [ Sighs ] Are you okay with this? With this? This arrangement-- the apartment. Absolutely. [ Birds chirping ] [ Clock ticking ] Reverend : Our savior illuminates the darkness. He shines his heavenly light-- his cleansing light-- on a righteous path, showing us the way. Now, Lucifer thrives in darkness. He places his stones, his lies, in dark places so that we will stumble and fall from grace into eternal damnation. You see, lies are the Devil's handmaidens. They are his sword and his shield. They weigh down our hearts with sorrow and corruption. They banish us from the kingdom yet to come. Now and forevermore. Amen. Amen. - Amen. Amen. - Amen. Amen. [ "Pac-Man" noises play ] [ Sounds continue ] [ Sighs ] You're good at games. I'll give you that. I enjoy the maze part, and the eating-without-eating part. Pac-dots are calorie-free. What's the verdict on the Prince intelligence? Science and technical officers at the Rezidentura made a cursory review. And? It's 10 years ahead of anything we have in the field. So you think the colonel's for real. US Intelligence would never give up anything this valuable as part of a trap. Philip and I both question Prince's motives. He says $50,000 is his motive. I think that's believable. Think how much Prince could get from the FBI for delivering a Directorate "S" officer to them. He'd be swimming in very deep water. He doesn't strike me as the type. The FBI could be behind it without Prince being aware. They could be controlling the source and waiting for a meeting to be set up with the colonel. A meeting has been set. The colonel put the time and location for us on a microdot. He also said the technical information he sent was just to prove he's for real. He says that he has something truly vital for us, but he can only give that to us in person. A trap is always a possibility. But in this case, it's worth the risk. That's easy to say from the sidelines. Don't get your panties in a bunch, Elizabeth. This isn't about you and me. The Centre wants the meeting with the colonel to proceed. I don't trust a word that bitch says. I mean, who knows what she could be up to? So, let's contact the Centre. Make sure her orders are real. Tell them to bring her back home. Assign us a new handler. I am done. We should've done this a long time ago. I've never liked her. There's one more move we could make to see if the meeting with the colonel is an FBI set-up. What? We put a bug in Gaad's office. [ Sighs ] Right. If the FBI are running an operation to trap KGB officers, chances are they're talking about it. Philip, there is no way we'll get a bug in Gaad's office. Martha could do it. No knock on your charms there, Romeo, but there's no way she'll go for that. She'll go for it. [ Sighs ] Ooh, gotcha. Pitch one in here, pitcher. [ Laughs ] Okay, go. Arc it. Ooh. Right on the teeth. [ Laughs ] Come on. Ooh! There we go! Now we're in the ballpark. Your turn. Heads up. All right. I'm ready. [ Laughs ] Ready? Oh! There it is! Oh! [ Knock on door ] Hi. I could hear you guys laughing out in the hall. Are you early? No, I-I'm right on time. I'll get your mac and cheese. All right. Um, do you have everything that you brought? Your homework and... Paige : I didn't really get to it. So, I don't have any tupperware yet. Just give me the bowl back when you're done. Okay. Three cheeses. Right? Bye, dad. Bye. Bye, sweetheart. Okay. sh1t. I mean, really, driving all the way to Leesburg? Isn't there such a thing as being too careful? No. Actually, there isn't. And if you ask me, our-- our secret makes it that much more romantic. I would love to share our relationship, Clark. I would like to shout it from the rooftops. One day, Martha, I-I promise-- just... not now. Waiter : Here you go, sir. What's this? I believe it's called champagne. Are we celebrating? I certainly hope so. [ Chuckles ] Thank you. Great. Thank you. Enjoy. Martha... I want you to close your eyes. And I want you to concentrate. But don't say anything until I'm done, okay? Okay. [ Laughs ] "M"... Shh. Shh. Shh. [ Whispering ] "A," "R"... "R"... "Y." [ Laughs ] Yes. Oh, yes! Yes, I will marry you, Clark. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. [ Laughs ] Wow. Thank you. Wow. [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] [ Door closes ] I was worried. I'm sorry. I was detained at work. I can't stay. Is everything all right? Nothing is ever all right. Arkady is expecting me. Something going on I need to know about? Sonya met a deputy chief of mission at the French embassy. They've had lunch twice. She developing him? Yes. Arkady thinks he's vulnerable. Is he intel or-- or legit diplomat? We don't know yet. She's meeting him again next week. Good. Are you okay? Now I am. You? I don't know. Come here. [ Chuckles ] I had a dream about you. Oh, you did? A good one, I hope. I was in a fire, a burning building-- the Rezidentura, maybe. I don't know. There was so much smoke I couldn't see anything. But then I saw you. You came through the fire and the smoke and everything. Did I save you? Who knows? I woke up. I was safe, but you were gone. It was you. Did you kill Vlad? I would never do anything to hurt you. You know that. Let me. I want to take your name. What? I know it's not what the modern woman does these days, but I want to be Mrs. Clark Westerfeld. Martha, you can't take my name. I know. I know. Mr. rules and regulations. Look... there is nothing I would like more than to be able to say, "this is my wife, Martha Westerfeld." But there's no need. You're already right here. Aww. Oh, you have the look on your face. [ Laughs ] You have the "Martha, I need to ask you something important" look. [ Laughs ] Wow. Am I that predictable? Mm-hmm. [ Laughs ] But I've dated nothing but unpredictable since I was 15 years old. So I'm ready for Steady Freddy. Wow. Okay. [ Zipper zips ] Uh, well, here's the thing, my wife-to-be. [ Breathes deeply ] Agent Gaad... Is my boss. Hm? Right, and the next time your boss is out of the office, I would like you to do me a favor. What kind of favor? I need you to place this in Agent Gaad's office. Somewhere where he won't notice it or pick it up. Keep this in your purse because I'll need to check it when we meet at night. Clark, you, uh... [Sighs] You came out of nowhere, like some sign from the universe that, after a lot of crappy years, things would be okay. Are things gonna be okay, Clark? I mean... just please tell me that they'll be okay. They will. I promise. I'm right here. There's-- I have a lot of good reasons for all of this, and I can go into them if you want, but look at me-- look me in the eyes. Do you want me to, or do you trust me? I trust you. I love you. 
 
 [ Clock ticking ] Could you make up the guest room, Viola? The Eppersons will be staying with us this weekend. Deborah loves lilacs and chocolate. Well, I'll leave her some by the bed. Thank you. Can I talk to you for a minute, Mrs. Weinberger? Uh... In the other room? [ Ticking continues ] Of course. I didn't want to do it. I swear. We know that. I was afraid. Not for myself-- for Grayson. They made him very sick. They said they could help him, that they were the  only  ones who could help him. But if I said anything, Grayson was gonna die. [ Voice breaking ] He put a pillow to his face and said he'd be dead in 15 seconds. I begged him-- I begged him to stop. So I said I'd do it. I put the clock... back into Mr. Weinberger's office. You're a very brave woman. I'm gonna call in a sketch artist. Would that be okay? [ Sniffles ] Yes. [ Indistinct conversations ] This is big. The CIA officer who was nabbed at the wheel house-- Richard Patterson. He was taken by a couple-- a man and a woman. That is no coincidence. No. [ "Mississippi Queen" plays ] ♪ Way down around Vicksburg ♪ 
♪ around Louisiana Way ♪ 
♪ there lived a cajun lady ♪ 
♪ aboard the Mississippi Queen ♪ [ Song ends ] Wow. I thought you guys sounded good. Thanks. Hey. Door was open. Oh, hey. Thanks for coming. Should I plug in, or...? We only have one amp. Hmm. Well, what are you guys playing? I could just come in on some vocals or whatever. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, you can play my guitar for now. Paige : They were doing "Mississippi Queen." I'm Paige. Sarah. Are you in the band? No. Yeah, she's just watching. So, should we? [ Plays "Mississippi Queen" ] [ Laughter ] Harry : Totally. Let's play again. [ Drumsticks clack rhythmically ] She sounds like Pat Benatar. And he called her "righteous." Feelings come and go, honey. It doesn't mean the battle is lost. I don't want to fight for his feelings, mom. Either he's into me or he's not. And he's not. [ Sighs ] How well do you even know Matthew? I mean, I know you like him, you think he's smart. Maybe you like the way he looks at you underneath all that hair of his. [ Sighs ] But the thing to understand is that... we see what we need to see in people-- things that aren't really there. Is that what happened with you and dad? Did you need to see something in him that wasn't really there? No. It was there. You should finish your French homework. [ Ticking ] It's off now. How do you know? I can read its signature. There's no signal at the moment, but it's fully functional. How long has it been here? A few months. It's extremely sensitive-- a Russian version of our 3VX. State-of-the-art. Built to filter out ambient sound. Okay, you can put it back together. You're just gonna leave it like that? Ma'am? The clock with the... thing in it. It's all right, Mrs. Weinberger. Your husband's been briefed. Now that we know they're listening, we'll know what to say. [ Ticking continues ] [ Telephone rings ] Martha. Ohh! Jumpy. Um... I was daydreaming. Thank you. These are the surveillance reports that you requested. Just put them on my desk. Okay. Um... Was there something or...? Yes. I need to re-schedule my 2:30 with Tennyson for 5:00. Okay. Martha. Yes? I'm sorry I startled you. Not to worry. [ Knock on door ] Clark, I'm sorry I woke you. Come on in. This couldn't wait. What is it? Um... [Sighs] I like to think that I'm a practical person. Yeah. I think that's what we like about-- that's what we love about each other. So I made a pro-and-con list. Um... I mean, look. I can't even tell my parents? Okay. All right. Martha, with my job and my security clearance, if my superiors were to find out I was even secretly dating, let alone married to someone I'm supposed to be overseeing in an investigation, I could go to jail. [ Sighs ] I bought rings, you know. [ Sighs ] Listen. I just want to be sure that you're going into this thing... Marriage. ...with both eyes open. Because we won't be able to live together. I'll stay when I can, of course, but, Martha, no one-- no one-- can know about this. Not for the foreseeable future, anyway. [ Sighs ] I have to come clean with you about something. I've been married before. A long time ago-- it didn't work out. Why not? It's funny. It's something I've been thinking a lot about lately, but I realized that... [ Sighs ] ...me and my ex-wife-- we-- we didn't care enough. What do you mean? What I mean is, we cared about each other, but [Sighs] we didn't know how to be married. Does that sound silly? No. It sounds sad. And I'm sorry, Clark, but I can't do this if we can't tell my parents. Because this kind of happiness, really, it's-- it's all they've ever wanted for me. But can we trust them? They live 2,000 miles away at the end of an old dirt road, and all they care about is me. Yes, we can trust them. Well, then, okay. Okay? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Clark, I don't want to wait. Let's just get married this weekend. Let's just find someone to marry us and let's do it. Let's just do it our way. Till death do us part. Gaad :  The budget is what the budget is. If that's a problem, we'll bring it up with the Deputy AG when we meet with him tomorrow. Yeah, that's it. Our first day live in Gaad's office. No mention of Prince or any meeting with the colonel. Which doesn't mean it's not a trap. Well, we have 72 hours to figure that out before we have to meet with him. When's the wedding? [ Inhales sharply ] Yeah. It's tomorrow. Not wasting any time. I wanted a longer engagement. Martha had other plans. Mm... I need you there. I need a family-- relatives. Okay. [ Clears throat ] [ Siren wails ] [ Car door opens ] Excuse me, sir. Can I see some ID? Yeah. Yeah. One second. Mr. Prince, turn around and put your hands on the roof of the car. Sure. Prince was arrested. sh1t. Any idea how the FBI got onto him? Not FBI-- local police. Failure to pay child support. [ Sighs ] Okay. [ Scoffs ] How many days before the feds start looking into an incarcerated Department Of Defense employee with a high-level security clearance and a felony charge hanging over his head? All we need is three days until you meet with the colonel. Even if the meeting wasn't a setup before, it's insane to go into it now with Prince in custody. He could be broken with a feather duster. I know you and Philip radioed the Centre to confirm the orders for the meeting. I also know they confirmed them for you. What confuses me is why you went around me. Do you really think I'd make something like this up, with the security of our nation at stake? Is that what you care about-- our nation? I hadn't figured that out. I do. And orders to meet with the colonel were confirmed, as you know. That was before Prince was arrested. I don't see Moscow changing their minds. Philip : Martha, Mr. and Mrs. Hanson, I'd like you to meet my mother, Alexandra, my sister, Jennifer. [ Laughs ] Is it okay if I hug you? Oh, welcome to the family, Martha. Thank you. You're exactly as Clark described. Aww. Hi, there. Hi. I'm Bill. Uh, this is my wife, Elaine. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. So nice to meet you both. I can see the family resemblance. [ Laughs ] That's what people say. Yeah. Yeah, they do. Clark Westerfeld and Martha Hanson? Yes. You ready? Of course. Officiant : An oath is both a statement for the present and a promise to the future. It is the means by which we humans tell each other, "I'm in this for the long haul." Martha Anne Hanson, do you take this man, Clark Herbert Westerfeld, to be your husband and partner, in good times and bad, till death do you part? Yes, I do. Clark Herbert Westerfeld, do you take this woman, Martha Anne Hanson, to be your wife and partner, in good times and bad, till death do you part? I do. Please place the ring on the other's finger. By the power vested in me by the State of Virginia, I pronounce you man and wife. [ Laughs ] Oh, mommy! Oh, daddy. It was beautiful. [ Indistinct conversations ] Welcome to the family. Oh, thank you. Thank you. [ Laughter ] Congratulations. It was touching. No. It was. I didn't expect it to be. You and I were never really married. No. It's funny-- I know they're just words people say. Do you think things would've been different between us if we would've said them? [ Sighs ] I don't know. [ Sighs ] Gaad : This is a composite of the woman based on Patterson's description. And this is one of the woman based on Viola Johnson's description. Different people. Not necessarily. Hair, eyebrows, and noses all completely different. The bone structures are similar. Both women have cheekbones, yeah. Noses, lips, ears. The differences are superficial, sir. So... this one is based on Viola Johnson's description of the man who poisoned her son. Deputy AG : What do we have from Patterson on this guy? Patterson never actually got a look at him. But we know that we're looking for a Caucasian man and woman, in their 30s, perhaps 40s. I'm not convinced the people who abducted Richard Patterson are the same people who poisoned Viola Johnson's son. I am. You say that based on these drawings? And my experience in the field. This is speculation. Call it what you may. These people are the illegals we've been chasing. [ Knock on door ] Da.
