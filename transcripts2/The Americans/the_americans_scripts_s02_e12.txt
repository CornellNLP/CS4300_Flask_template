 Previously on The Americans... 
 The FBI knows about Emmett and Leanne. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 And Stan Beeman paid their son a visit. 
 I'm not stupid. 
 I know you're not. 
 But I want to know what's going on. 
 There's a protest at an air-force base in Pennsylvania this weekend. 
 A group from church is going. 
 I want to go, too. 
 It's not you that I want. 
 It's the scumbags who killed my friends. 
 Where are they? 
 What will happen to me, Stan? 
 I will find a way out... for you  and  for me. 
 I can't go back. 
 What does it say? 
 "Get Jared out." 
 Kate's dead. 
 Probably. 
 I'm going down there. I'm gonna get Jared. 
 Whoever killed Emmett and Leanne probably killed Kate. 
 We need to have The Centre make sure that Larrick is still in Nicaragua. 
 I'll go signal. 
 Wait. 
 Just... until we know what's going on, I... 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. I'll stay. 
 Kids shouldn't be in the house alone. 
 Signal from here. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. 
 What are the odds the FBI's signal chasing in Falls Church right now? 
 Okay. Go. 
 I'll do it when the kids are in bed. 
 There was an emergency at work. 
 I'm gonna head into the office. 
 Did a plane full of your clients crash? 
 That's not funny. 
 Sorry. I... 
 Tell me, what exactly happened at work? 
 What is the matter with you, Paige? 
 We had an important client fly into Phoenix with his whole sales team and the reservations were canceled. 
 The hotel was overbooked, so now we have to find them other rooms. 
 And you can't do that from the phone here? 
 All of our contacts are at the office. 
 After your homework, don't forget to do the dishes. 
 I thought you were gonna help me pack for my trip. 
 Can we, um, can we do that tomorrow? 
 I-- I have to leave straight from school tomorrow. 
 I need to pack tonight. 
 Paige, I'm so sorry. 
 I really-- I wanted to help you, but I just... 
 The business. 
 I really can't tonight. 
 Yeah. 
 Fine. 
 Arnold :  But remember, I'm at your beck and call. 
 Computerized voice :  Four, three, five, one, eight. 
 I, uh, thought you were asleep. 
 I thought  you  were asleep. 
 No, I was just doing some housework. 
 Mom's not back? 
 No, still at work. 
 You know, it's two hours earlier in Arizona. 
 And it's a lot of work, this... hotel stuff. 
 Right. 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 Hello? 
 Elizabeth : Hey. 
 Hey, honey. Everything okay there? 
 House, neighborhood-- everything quiet. You? 
 I, uh, I asked about our friend. 
 No one knows where she is right now. 
 Also, we're not the only ones having trouble contacting our answering service. 
 They do want the boy to-- [ Line clicks ] 
 Paige? 
 Paige? 
 Paige, hang up the phone and let me and mom talk, please. 
 And if we catch you listening in again, we will take that phone out of your room. 
 The young man we were talking about, our client agrees we should get him a ticket out ASAP. 
 Also, he knows why his parents traveled so much. 
 What? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 W-why would they tell him that? 
 That's all I got. It was a short back-and-forth, obviously. 
 But listen, remember what we used a couple of years back to let that guy Andy know we were friends? 
 Yes. 
 They said it would work with the boy, too. 
 Okay. 
 No one's seen Kate? 
 No. George either. 
 Damn it. 
 Get home soon. 
 I will. 
 [ Dial tone ] 
 We'll take you to a big city, no Soviet consulate. 
 Somewhere you can blend in. 
 I'll visit every weekend I can. 
 What about you? 
 Oleg will find a way to let the FBI know about what you did with the surveillance reports. 
 You said you can go to jail. 
 He can't prove it. 
 There could be a mole in the FBI. 
 People leave that crap on top of the mail robot all the time. 
 It would seem like a hundred other provocations the KGB has made. 
 I'll be fine. 
 I'm gonna get you a car and some money. 
 You can leave tomorrow. 
 And what? 
 I'll just drive where you tell me? 
 You know what to do. 
 You know how to disappear if you have to. 
 I will visit you whenever I can. 
 For how long? 
 As long as we need. 
 Eventually we'll figure out something much better. 
 [ Dogs barking ] 
 Hi, Jared. 
 Hi. 
 I think the three things a person should focus on every day are health, growth, and community. 
 Don't you? 
 Please get in the car for a minute. 
 I want to talk to you. 
 I know this is surprising. I know it's hard. 
 But I have something I need to talk to you-- 
 So, you're not a social worker? 
 No. 
 I knew your parents very well. 
 I came before to check on you 'cause I knew they'd want me to. 
 You knew my parents? 
 Yeah. 
 I worked with them sometimes. 
 We had the same job. 
 You know about that, right? 
 We have to take a drive, talk about some important things. 
 Okay? 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Henry : It's coming out in June, but I just can't imagine it being any good. 
 I mean, the first one was terrible. 
 It was nothing like the TV show at all. 
 Although, Khan was on the show, so maybe it'll be better. 
 But I don't know. 
 I just don't have high expectations. 
 Well, another day, another no dollar. 
 So, be careful at the protest. 
 Don't get arrested. 
 Guess I'm not gonna see mom. 
 She said to tell you to have a good trip. 
 Did everyone get a room? 
 Yeah. 
 See you Sunday night. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Henry : If she gets arrested, are we gonna go to Pennsylvania to bail her out? 
 She's not gonna get arrested. 
 Yes, she is. 
 You're late, so go. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 You met with a woman from our organization. 
 She taught you that signal. 
 That if someone said it, that meant you could trust them. 
 Where is she? 
 I don't know where she is right now. 
 The reason I'm here-- and I'm gonna be completely honest with you, Jared... there are some problems, and you might be in some danger. 
 With what happened to your family, you can understand we want to be very careful. 
 We want to take the best possible care of you right now. 
 What problems? 
 And how do you not know where she is? 
 There are people out there who always want to hurt us, in this work that we do. 
 We're concerned there's a specific danger right now. 
 To me? 
 Yeah. 
 Jared, I made a promise to your mother to look out for you, and I'm going to do that. 
 I'm gonna get you somewhere safe. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I said I'd be honest with you, and I will be. 
 So, there's something hard you have to understand. 
 You're not gonna be able to go back to your old life. 
 What do you mean? 
 Ever? 
 I know it sounds awful right now, but the whole idea will get easier in a while, I promise you. 
 Knowing your mom and dad, who they were, the kind of people they were, I know you have the strength inside to get through this. 
 [ Steady beeping ] 
 Hey, honey. 
 I am so sorry I didn't make it back here last night, but I brought you your favorite danish. 
 Ooh, good. 
 Where did you get these? 
 People just leave them on top of the mail robot. 
 Completely unsecured. 
 I've made several complaints, and no one listens. 
 So I think your office should know about it. 
 You just took them? 
 I did. 
 You want proof Agent Gaad isn't running a secure facility. 
 You have it. 
 Um... 
 Martha, this is incredibly helpful, but you have to be careful. 
 Classified documents are carefully tracked. 
 No, they're not. That's the point. 
 You think security is bad there? You have no idea. 
 They're ordered up from Archives, read, and left on top of that robot for half the day while it goes around the Bureau. 
 Anyone could take them. 
 And when they're sent back, the clerks don't want to be bothered if it's after hours, so people leave them on the floor outside the door to the file room overnight. 
 Okay. 
 I-I just want to be sure you're being careful. 
 Clark, I love the way you love me. 
 You don't have to hide anything from me. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 I even love your toupee. 
 You know about that? 
 I can be a little bit late for work today. 
 Can you? 
 How long have you known? 
 Man : How are you today, sir? 
 Stan : Good. 
 You looking for something specific? 
 Just something reliable that won't crap out as soon as I drive it off the lot. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 For my niece. 
 No, thanks. 
 Yeah, filthy habit. 
 Always the hardest to kick. 
 I got a "niece" special right over here. 
 One owner. 
 Little old lady? 
 Drove it to church? 
 To Atlantic City, actually. 
 Back and forth a lot. 
 She had a gambling problem. 
 Another bad habit. 
 Had to sell it for beans. 
 It's clean as a whistle. 
 It's got a lot of miles on it, but, uh, it's a good deal. 
 Yeah, $3,400 is a little out of my price range. 
 What were you thinking? 
 More like the Maverick. 
 Maverick's a piece of sh1t. 
 I sell it to you, I got to go to confession. 
 Well, how about we meet in the middle? 
 I got a lot of vehicles in your price range, functional vehicles. 
 But if you want your niece to have a safe, comfortable ride, a ride that demonstrates how much she means to you, this will do the trick. 
 And what if I pay cash? 
 We accept cash. 
 I'd buy it myself if I had someone who meant a lot to me, because that's what this car says. 
 "You mean a lot to me." 
 But I am a sorry-assed son of a bitch. 
 I don't have a niece. I don't even have a cousin. 
 I can't fill out the registration right now. 
 I'm in a bit of a hurry. 
 Not a problem on my end. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 There's a restroom over there. You need to go in, you need to change... into these clothes. 
 Why? 
 It's something that we do. We clean ourselves. You don't get to take anything with you. When you're done, put everything, including your shoes, into your backpack and bring it back to me. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 [ Steady beeping ] 
 Oh. Mm. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Could you...? 
 Thanks. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Ah! 
 Well, I'm glad you came by. 
 Me too. 
 Clark. 
 Mm-hmm? 
 It's so nice, just the two of us. 
 But, well, when do you think it would be good to start thinking about the three or four of us? 
 Martha, that's not for me. 
 And I thought you understood that. 
 Well, what do you mean? 
 My life, my career-- I'm not around all the time. 
 You can't raise kids that way. 
 Well, I know, but this arrangement isn't forever. 
 At some point we'll-- 
 I'm sorry, Martha. 
 It's... 
 Children aren't in the cards for me. 
 [ Train bell dinging ] 
 [ Train whistle blows ] 
 So, where-- where are they taking me? 
 It's not settled yet. I'll come in a few days. 
 I'll let you know and help with everything. 
 But will it be in this country? 
 No. 
 Let's just get you where you need to go today. 
 Do you remember where you get off the train? 
 Yeah. 
 I put in some water and some sandwiches for you. 
 Your train leaves in 10 minutes. 
 You should probably go. 
 Wait. 
 This is the phone number you should call when you get there. 
 You can't lose this. 
 I won't. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Beeping rapidly ] 
 Nina, I've got everything ready. 
 I-- 
 You know who I am? 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 You can't do this. 
 Your lover has committed treason against us, and you have committed treason against your country. 
 That's a lie. 
 Tell him, Nina Sergeevna. 
 They will take me back for trial, Stan. 
 For what we did together. 
 They will execute me. 
 Let's not debate about the rest. 
 Let's talk about where to go from here. 
 There are alternatives that are better for me than to send this document to your superiors and her back to Moscow for trial and execution. 
 You could go off together, free and happy. 
 Does this interest you, Agent Beeman? 
 It's a simple transaction. 
 You have access to a computer program called Echo. 
 It's part of Stealth. 
 When you deliver the Echo program to me, I will let Nina Sergeevna go free. 
 And you two love birds can fly off together. 
 [ Speaking Russian ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Glad your parents let you come. 
 Yeah, I was surprised. 
 But, yeah... 
 What changed their minds? 
 I think they were afraid of what I'd do if they said no. 
 What were you gonna do? 
 Something. 
 Nothing. I dot know. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 They knew it was important to you. 
 I guess. 
 Is your dad hard on you? 
 Um... 
 I don't know. 
 It's-- it's usually more my mom. 
 I mean, I love them-- I do. 
 But it's like I don't even know who they are. 
 And sometimes I think he's having an affair, or she's having an affair, or both. 
 All I know is, I don't believe a word that comes out of their mouths anymore. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Being a parent's hard. 
 But so is having parents. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Oh, I know. [ Laughs ] 
 Where's Henry? 
 Peter's house. 
 Went straight from school. 
 Paige should be Pennsylvania by now. 
 And everyone-- 
 Everyone else is clean. 
 There's not a trace of surveillance on any of us. 
 And any word from The Centre about Kate or George? 
 [ Sighs ] They want us to move on something. 
 Now. 
 Paint samples they use on a Stealth aircraft. 
 Great. 
 I know. 
 How was he? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 He went. 
 Didn't fall apart. 
 Tough kid. 
 Like his parents. 
 Mm. 
 That's what I told him. 
 The only thing, why was Kate meeting him out of disguise? 
 And why would The Centre tell him about his parents? 
 They don't have to do that to give him money or to make sure he's okay. 
 I'm sure they know what they're doing. 
 They should keep us informed. 
 Well, they don't think it's any of our business. 
 If something else were going on, if they thought we were at risk, they'd tell us. 
 I know. 
 All right. 
 Are you going back to Fred on the Stealth paint? 
 Yeah, he's our way in. 
 And we need to move fast, but... 
 But what? 
 I-I haven't turned him over. 
 He's still Emmett's agent. 
 What is he like? 
 Loner, grandiose. 
 Tells himself he was doing it for the cause, but Emmett could have hi working for spacemen from Mars if it made him feel like he was better than everyone else. 
 No friends, no girlfriend. 
 Gutsy, smart, reliable. I kind of like him. 
 How did Emmett get through to him? 
 Family. Talked to him about his family. 
 Guy had a closet full of gifts for Jared. 
 [ Indistinct conversation, indistinct talking on PA ] 
 Excuse me, ma'am. 
 I'm Detective Korrigan, Petersburg County. 
 We are looking for a runaway boy, 16 years old, slight build, dark hair. 
 Might be traveling with a female, mid to late 30s. 
 We have reason to believe he departed from this station, with or without the woman, in the last hour or so. 
 There was a boy with brown hair. 
 He took the train alone about an hour ago. 
 Where was he going? 
 Upstate New York. 
 Let me look up the station for you. 
 [ Train bell dinging ] 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 You too. I've heard a lot about you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 All those years, I never met Emmett's wife. 
 Well, we're really not supposed to, but... 
 You can't always follow the rules. 
 Yeah. 
 How've you been? 
 Everyone back home is worried because we're behind in a lot of important ways. 
 I talked with Skeevers. 
 He told me about a faction called 237. 
 You know it? 
 I've heard of it. 
 Is there any way you could get in there? 
 For some kind of budget review, something like that? 
 Think I can. 
 They make radar-absorbent paint, and we need a sample but you would have to get on the shop floor. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 That's not the most natural place to go when you're doing a budget review. 
 It's a restricted area. 
 You would just need 45 seconds walking across the floor, that's it. 
 We have shoes with special soles that would pick up traces of what we need. 
 There's a lot of security. 
 Fred, I-I... 
 I can't tell you how important this is. 
 Of all the things going on right now, this is it-- the thing that'll make the difference. 
 I'll make some calls. 
 I'll let you know when I can get into the factory. 
 As for the floor, once I'm there, I might be able to wander on. 
 Say I'm lost. 
 Budget guys are always getting lost. 
 Stan : Yes, Emmett and Leanne Connors, the couple that was murdered with their daughter. 
 We're talking to anyone who worked with them in any capacity. 
 Right. 
 And before the field agent comes out to interview you, it would be helpful if you could make a list of anyone else you knew who did business with Mr. Connors. 
 Great. 
 Well, we'll be in touch, then. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Indistinct talking ] 
 Stan : Sir? 
 That's all. 
 Uh, in looking into Stealth, I discovered a computer program they use called Echo. 
 I think it's a real weak spot-- something the Soviets might try to go after. 
 So I'm gonna look into it, see if I can shore up their security. 
 Great. 
 Echo, it's called. 
 I don't really understand it. Computer stuff. 
 [ Scoffs ] Who does? 
 Come on. I have dinner for you. 
 [ Typewriter keys clacking ] 
 We've developed information suggesting active KGB threats against something called Echo. 
 Do you know what that is? 
 Of course. 
 I understand it's some sort of computer program, but that's all I know. 
 And the fact that the KGB wants to get their hands on it. 
 They wouldn't know what to do with it. 
 I'll need to do a full security review. 
 I'll need files on everyone who has access to the program, and locations and security procedures of every place that runs it. 
 There's only one place. 
 I can get you in to check it out tomorrow. 
 [ Tapping ] 
 Oleg... 
 Hey. 
 Oh, hey. Did you want something? 
 Oh, no thanks. I'm not hungry. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, I stole something for you. 
 Rocky Horror. 
 Got a whole evidence locker full of that stuff now. 
 Thanks. 
 Thought you could have some friends over to watch it. 
 I'm going to meet up with Kyle. 
 Oh, I-I-I'll give you a lift. 
 Oh, no, it's fine. I'm gonna walk. 
 I'm going. 
 Okay. See you later. 
 Bye. 
 All right. Have fun. 
 Do you want me to move out? 
 Uh... 
 No. 
 I'm gonna move in with him. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 He a good guy? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 He's... able to be in the flow of things. 
 Yeah. 
 He's a good guy. 
 He's at the cabin. 
 They're getting the passports and papers now. 
 Exfiltration team is on their way. 
 Good. 
 Did Paige call? 
 I spoke to the secretary at the church. 
 They're up there. They're fine. 
 What? What is it? 
 Where the hell are we sending him? 
 Switzerland? Hungary? 
 They might want to keep him close. 
 Or Australia. 
 Somewhere he can just get along in English. 
 Mm. 
 So, that kid who grew up in Virginia Beach, we'll just drop him off somewhere? 
 One of those places? 
 Doesn't know anyone. 
 Sounds like us. 
 We had each other. We were older. 
 Our parents hadn't just been killed. 
 I just mean he has no choice. 
 But he'll figure it out. 
 He'll make it. 
 If Paige and Henry were in his shoes, they wouldn't. 
 They'd be dead in an alley in a week. 
 Paige is smarter than anyone. 
 She can talk people in cir-- 
 She can think people in circles. 
 And Henry, yeah, he's a kid. 
 But in a couple of years, who knows? 
 One day, it's coming. 
 You know it is. 
 Take it easy, all right? 
 Because nobody knows anything, so just... just take it easy. 
 Larrick : We think he might have come in on the last train. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I saw him. 
 Great. Did somebody pick him up? 
 Yeah. A lady in a truck. 
 What kind of truck?
