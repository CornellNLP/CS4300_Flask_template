 Previously on "The Americans..." 
 Amador : Undercover agents supposedly hiding all over the U.S. 
 Super-secret identities... no one has any idea who they are. 
 How have you been, Martha? 
 Fine, Clark. 
 Big day at FBI counterintelligence? 
 Martha : They were in the secure vault all day. 
 Did you get a look inside this time? 
 They don't let me in there. 
 You're violating a shitload of Soviet laws, and you're looking at 10 years in a siberian labor camp. 
 You're gonna have to start working for me. 
 You can't call me at the embassy ever! 
 Are you trying to get me killed? 
 Grannie : The Americans are working on a new technology, one that could put our nuclear arsenal at risk. 
 Elizabeth : When we got here, I was 22 years old, living in a strange house, in a strange country, with a strange man. 
 It never really happened for us, but I feel like it's happening now. 
 [ Doorbell rings ] 
 Frances Raysens, Viseotech security. 
 Come in. 
 Can you check my credential fully, please, sir? 
 Of course. 
 Elizabeth : A few weeks ago, the department of defense mandated a top-to-bottom security review of all private company contractors in the ballistic missile defense program. 
 I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions, sir. 
 Um... 
 I waited as long as I possibly could out of respect. 
 I'm... Very sorry about your wife. 
 Thank you. 
 It was 35 years, right? 
 And eight months. 
 That's... that's really something. 
 Can you please state your name, position, and security level for the record? 
 Adam Dorwin, manager, Viseotech laser operations group, top-secret clearance, code word Barta. 
 This past January, your group expanded into the D.O.D Strategic Defense initiative program. 
 Have you received any communications from foreign agents or governments since that time? 
 I have not. 
 Do you believe in the American system of government? 
 I do. 
 Do you believe your contacts in the department of defense are trustworthy? 
 Trustworthy idiots. 
 In the past six months, have you been approached by women... younger women in particular... who have made sexual advances? 
 No. 
 Have you ever paid for s*x? 
 [ Chuckles ] No. 
 Since joining the laser operations group, have you had any sexual liaisons with any woman other than your wife? 
 No. 
 Did you ever talk to your wife about your classified work? 
 No. 
 She never asked any questions about what you did all day? 
 She knew enough not to. 
 So, in the 35 years and 8 months, not a single question? 
 That's right. 
 [ Thunder crashes ] 
 Well? 
 I could have cracked him in 30 seconds. 
 [ Sighs ] You sure? 
 He needs his handler now, face-to-face, or we're gonna lose him. 
 Yeah. He's left four signals for him in the last week. 
 So, why hasn't he met him? 
 Everyone's locked up in the Rezidentura. 
 The FBI surveillance teams are using new encryption technology on their radios. 
 We can't tell when they're following us anymore, so there's no way to meet an agent. 
 So, why don't I go in, talk to him, at least let him know that we haven't forgotten about him? 
 I can talk to him till his handler can get out. 
 You know, the CIA does it that way. 
 An agent can be run by different case workers, and their agents are never loyal to them. 
 There's no real bond. 
 I'm just saying, if we're desperate, I can at least go explain the situation to him. 
 I ran an agent in West Germany. 
 He was a loner... one of these oddballs who never really learned to make a friend. 
 So, I became his friend. 
 Many years later, I was leaving and we didn't really need him anymore. 
 I explained it all to him. 
 And he thanked me for... The chance to work together. 
 He killed himself shortly thereafter. 
 We didn't need him anymore, but he needed us. 
 Udacha, we need. 
 Without him, we'd have no antiballistic missile intelligence. 
 We'd have no decent network in the military high tech at all. 
 So, what do we do? 
 Find a way to get the FBI's encryption codes so he can meet with the one man he trusts. 
 I told you, you can't call here. 
 I'm hanging up now. No, please. I need... don't say names. 
 I lost her, and I'm alone. 
 No, no. You're not alone. 
 Listen to me. You'll be okay. 
 I don't think so. I don't... no, no. No. 
 Listen to me. Listen to me. 
 We'll meet soon, my friend. I can help you. 
 I promise. 
 [ Breathing shakily ] 
 [ Train whistle blows in distance ] 
 Hey. Good morning. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. How was the game? 
 Well, your husband is quite the hustler. 
 Hmm. 
 Even if he does play a little bit fast and loose with the rules. 
 [ Scoffs ] Well, what do you want? That was in. 
 I'm just saying it looked out to me. 
 Well, it was in. 
 I thought we were driving into work together today. 
 Yeah, Stan and I had to stop for breakfast. 
 I'm sorry if I kept him late, but we bet breakfast, so I had to buy him breakfast. 
 Even if it was out. 
 It was in. 
 So, are you gonna take the bus or, uh... 
 Yeah, I can take the bus. 
 I can give you a ride. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 That would be great. I got him. 
 Great. Good. See you later. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 [ Telephone ringing ] 
 Amador : Two months, we dated. All she wore was nurse's shoes. 
 You ask nice, maybe she'll give you another shot. 
 I asked nice. I asked twice. 
 Maybe the third time's the charm. Maybe. 
 Beeman, Amador, what would you make of it if I said to you, I feel like I'm standing at the edge of a diving board over a pool with no water in it? 
 You need a vacation? 
 The listening post just picked up this conversation between the Rezident and someone in a phone booth in Bethesda. 
 "I feel like I'm standing on a diving board at the edge"... so, what would you make of it? 
 Sounds to me like the guy could be an agent of theirs. 
 He's smart enough not to use his name on an open line. 
 And? Needs a vacation. 
 Sounds like he's spinning. I smell an opportunity. 
 Mr. Martin from the D.O.J is on the line for you, agent Gaad. 
 Those are nice shoes, Martha. 
 They flatter your calves. 
 That's actually a sexist comment, agent Amador. 
 Martha is right, agent Amador. 
 I expect everyone to speak respectfully to each other in this office at all times. 
 I'll be right there, Martha. 
 So, check with your source. 
 And where did you hear this? 
 Talks around the Rezidentura. 
 Do you have any idea who it could be who's calling him? 
 I don't know. 
 Somebody  knows. 
 Of course somebody knows. 
 Listen, Nina. I'm on your side, okay? 
 I am. 
 But you need to think of me as a... 
 As a wall that's protecting you, okay? 
 On the other side of that wall are some very decent and freedom-loving folks, but their love of freedom makes them impatient. 
 It makes them knock on the wall, and soon they're gonna start pounding on it. 
 You need to find out what's going on. 
 We don't have any leeway here. 
 You're a beautiful, intelligent, intuitive, and... Beautiful woman. 
 I have complete faith that you'll figure out a way to find out all you can. 
 "Da-verts men-ye." 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Davertyes Mnye. 
 Davertyes Mnye. But listen, that's not what you say when you want to say, "trust me." Why not? When you say it in that way, in those words, it's like,  "trust  me." It's like, "you don't have a choice." [ Soft music plays ] You seem distracted, Clark. Oh, I'm sorry. It's just, uh... It's been a rough day in the land of counterintelligence... rough week, actually. My... My boss is such a son of a gun, always breathing down my neck about... Are you feeling okay, Martha? I have been wanting to do that for a very long time. And if things were different with you and me, we could... we could absolutely... I...I have to protect our government's counterintelligence agencies, and you're rendering our nation a great service by helping me do that, but we can't trespass any boundaries... we can't. And I'm... Sorry. I like your shoes, by the way. [ Chuckles ] They're new. Oh. Well, I like your  new  shoes. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Sighs ] Earth to Clark. [ Chuckles ] It's... it's just, in the past three months, um, the surveillance systems of five of the seven C.I. Agencies that we oversee have been compromised, and I-I am worried about the bureau's surveillance technology, Martha. I mean, it keeps me up at night. Do you think agent Gaad's on top of it? Well, agent Gaad thinks the new surveillance contractor is great. You don't? No, I-I do. I do. It's just... I'm concerned the company wasn't properly vetted. You mean the guy? Right, you know, I think one of the other units was gonna hire, um... Schultz. Curt Schultz. Curt Schultz. You know what? He's supposed to be very good. I... you know what, I just... i worry. Well, that's your job. [ Groans ] My body is getting too old for racquetball. Maybe you're playing too much of it... you and your new best friend. I wouldn't call him my best friend. I am working him. Is that what you're doing? Look... [ Sighs ] There's a lot of good reasons to get close to this guy. He's already given us some useful information. Down the line, does he have vulnerabilities? Who knows what's possible? I think you should keep your distance. I  think you should stop worrying. So, what's your in with the encryption guy? Rival looking to buy. Oh. Competitor looking for a job. Inside info. I'd hire you in a heartbeat. Yeah? Yeah. [ Chuckles ] You and your socks. [ Laughs ] [ Both breathing heavily ] Does this mean I can tell my boss I've got a shot at buying your company? [ Chuckles ] Depends how the rest of the night goes. Then I guess we're in. [ Laughs ] Oh. Oh! [ Grunts ] Oh. [ Both grunting ] Oh, that was so nice, baby. I'm just getting started. Mm. That was such a strong finish, though. Turn over. Oh. Mm. You like that? Oh. Oh, yeah. [ Grunts ] Oh. [ Gasps ] What was that? Nice, right? Okay, that hurt! That hurt! It's supposed to hurt. [ Grunting ] You're gonna like this. Please! [ Crying ] Please, please! Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me. Shh. Shh. Stop making so much noise. Shh, shh. It's okay. Be quiet. Please, just be quiet. Shh. Shh. [ Sniffles ] If my boss knew what you were into, he probably wouldn't want to buy your company. Your boss isn't gonna buy my company... not for $3 million. I've seen the paperwork. I know what it's worth. There are things that aren't in the paperwork. Try 30. Things? You know we do classified work. They don't let us put everything down. I have a security clearance, and we already know you have encryption technology. Why do you think we wanted to buy you? Look, honey, the technology, I can't talk about. Anybody can cloak a signal, but I figured out how to make the system portable. Portable? Small enough to fit in the trunk of an FBI car. Wherever they go, it goes with them. $30 million. Not a penny less. [ Chuckles ] [ Breathing shakily ] [ Chuckles ] [ Laughs ] 
 
 How did it go? I got it. Great. We're gonna need cars, so I think maybe... what happened? Nothing. It's nothing. That... that's not nothing. It's fine. He was a little weird. Let me see. I said it was fine. How can you say that? It hap... it happens sometimes, Philip. Can I just... [ Gasps ] I'm gonna deal with it. You're gonna deal with it? Yeah. If I'd wanted to deal with him, you don't think he'd be dealt with? I wanted the intel, and I got it. Great. I'll be back in an hour. Philip, I don't need you to fight my battles for me. It's over. Let's just go to bed. Philip. [ Sighs ] What the hell is wrong with you? Somebody beat the sh1t out of my wife. I can handle it. It is my job. I know, but you don't deserve it. Philip, stop. You are not my daddy. No, I'm not your daddy. I'm your husband, Elizabeth. What do you think husbands do? I wouldn't know. Henry, where's your thermos? It's in the lunchbox, isn't it? No, it's not. I might have left it in the lunch room, then. Well, I told you before, you're not getting another one, so if this one's gone, get used to drinking out of the fountain. Henry, I'm sure you'll find your thermos. Let's all be ready to leave in five, okay? Okay. It's called responsibility. You sure he's planning to meet with the agent again? Yes. When? He didn't say. I didn't know you smoked. You don't know anything about me. Anything else? The guy's got jitters. The Rezident said that? Yes. So, he'll want to meet with him soon. How did you get him to talk? I sucked his cock, just like you told me to. I never said that. I-I never said that. Nina, Jesus... I-I-I wouldn't. [ Train passing ] [ Train whistle blows ] Okay. Listen... One day, you'll be living a different life, all right? You're gonna choose a new name for yourself, and I want you to choose carefully, Nina, the name of someone who sleeps very, very well at night. Exfiltration is coming soon, but we're not there yet. And in the meantime, we just have to keep working for the good of all concerned. We have to nail down when that meeting is happening, Nina. We? The good news is the encryption radios are kept in the trunks of cars. The bad news is the cars belong to the FBI, so we're gonna need intelligence on the cars, license plates, base locations. I'll check with Rezidentura. They keep careful logs on the cars that tail them. Elizabeth, is everything okay? Yes. I've been in this business a long time. Just been a rough couple of days. I won't say this job is twice as hard for women, but it's something close to that. I can handle it. I know you can. Have you been following the sad progress of this country's equal rights amendment? Honestly, it makes me chuckle. These women here need to learn what you and I have known forever... you can't wait for the laws to give you your rights. You have to take them, claim them, every second of every day of every year. [ Siren wails in distance ] I'll get you that information on the FBI cars, but they keep their vehicles under close guard. We'll figure it out. Phillip : You're sure that's the FBI two cars back? Elizabeth : Yes. I'm sure. Are you gonna stay mad forever? I'm not mad. At least I'm not tormenting little boys about lost thermoses. [ Tires squeal ] [ Tires screech ] [ Children playing in distance ] I'm so sorry, ma'am. Are you all right? Man : Nice going. Come on. Phillip : They have it up on the lift. Three employees... cashier, two mechanics. Two feds on the car. Let's get to work. I'll distract them. You'll have 45 seconds at most. So, I figured it was the oil. No, the oil's fine. The problem's with your drive shaft. Are you kidding me?! 'Cause this thing got a full tune-up like two weeks ago. Yeah, well, then, your mechanic's incompetent, because these u-joints are totally worn. So much for the reliable American automobile, huh? Yeah. So, your u-joints, we got to replace them, but, you know, it's your drive shaft, so it's up to you. Yeah, it's my drive shaft. You know, for what it's worth, when you, uh, pulled up, I thought, "this car's got drive-shaft issues written all over it." Really? Yeah. So, I guess my day just went from bad to expensive, huh? Yeah. So, um... I'm sorry. What... what do you call these things? These things? Those are tie rods. Right, and... and, uh... And that thing? That's the frame tunnel. Frame tunnel. You mind if I get by? I'm sorry. Do you smoke? Man : Yeah. So, uh, any idea how much this should cost me? Well, from what I've seen in this place, you're in for a gouging. Great. [ Whirring ] [ Laughs ] Man : Yo, almost dropped that. Man #2 : You're right. Yo, how many more of these we got? Hey, car's ready! We good? Where were you? Surveilling the grounds. While jerking off in the bathroom? I saw you with the motor-oil chicks calendar. Screw you. Yeah, screw you, too. Excuse me. Uh, is my car ready too? Oh, no. I got to keep it overnight. I had to order some needle bearings. You know what? Uh, forget it. I need it now. But I haven't replaced your u-joint, yet. Let me know what I owe you and give me my car. Oh, no question. By a decade. [ Tires squeal ] See ya. Have a good night. Good night. You okay? Fine. You didn't have to pick me up. I didn't have to bring you coffee, either. Or a vanilla-cream doughnut. [ Car door closes ] [ Sighs ] I'm sorry about before. You know, we have to do all sorts of things for our work, and it requires being a certain way. What exactly are you talking about? [ Chuckles ] You know what I wish as I fall asleep every night? That I'll wake up and not be worried. About what? [ Sighs ] Everything. You can't live like that. Show me another way. [ Engine turns over ] Woman :  Are you okay? Ty v poryadke? "Teve poor e-ad-ka?" "Teve poor e-ad-ka?" How is your mother? Kak tvaya mama? "Kak tavaya mama?" "Kak tavaya mama?" Hi.  Fine. And how are you? Hey. [ Click ] Coming to bed? Uh, I wish. This whole cyrillic alphabet thing is totally kicking my butt. Is that new? Mm-hmm. Oh, you're killing me. [ Click ] [  Speaks Russian  ] [ Click ] You know, a few years ago, before your long stint undercover, we used to go line dancing, you and I. [ Chuckles ] And we used to drink Chianti at the bar at the old spaghetti factory and host bridge nights once a month. And we used to have those family dubble bubble blowing contests. And you knew your son's three best friends' names. Life was really pretty freaking great, wasn't it? You remember? Yeah, I do. I won't be that long, all right? [ Scoffs ] Davertyes Mnye. Davertyes Mnye. [ Click ]  You have beautiful... [ Door opens ] [ Sighs ] The KGB's acquired the FBI's communication encryption code. The meeting with the Rezident's agent is happening. When? Today. 2:00. Thank you. [ Tires squeal ] Good going, Beeman. We're on it. Hey, Amador, the Rezident's meeting is happening today. We're gonna nail him with his agent. Get three teams together and catch up with your partner. Yes, sir. Lord, I have waited for this moment. I want you to track down that Carl Schultz guy. He needs to change the encryption codes in the trunk units. Those bastards think they can listen in on us, they got another thing coming. [ Sighs ] [ Birds chirping ] What's with you? Nothing. You've been moody all day. Like my ex-ex-girlfriend when she had her period. Look, what you don't know about marriage and family and responsibility and obligation and answering to people on a one-on-one, personal level for 23 years... I could fill a goddamn warehouse, Chris. See, that's what I'm talking about. Brown goose is 27 on foot, north on 36th street northwest. Man : Roger. Brown goose is 27 on foot, direction of the waterfront. We're on it, sir. Brown goose is continuing 27 towards the potomac. Roger. What's he doing? I don't know. Gazing. Brown goose is 36 at the potomac. Repeat... 36. Gazing? What would  you  call that? Did my friend send... man : Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Have a good night. You call a lot more than Gabriel ever did. We've got a problem. As soon as we got those encryption codes from you, the FBI changed them. Immediately? Within the day. Right when they were leaving for the meet, like they knew. You understand what that means? Somebody's talking. Somebody's talking. We have a mole. What did she say? Don't worry about it. I'll tell you in the morning.
