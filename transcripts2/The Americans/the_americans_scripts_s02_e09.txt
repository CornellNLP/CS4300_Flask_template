 Previously on The Americans... 
 What is it that you do there at the church? 
 We talk. 
 They get them when they're children. 
 They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs. 
 I really like the people at work. 
 I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore. 
 Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it. [ Button clicks ] 
 Gaad :  Oh, come on, guys. Martha's ugly. 
 [  Laughter  ] 
 We can expose US forces secretly training Contra commanders on American soil. 
 Elizabeth : It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic. 
 Which truck do you drive? 
 Number nine. 
 Where are the keys? 
 Inside the truck. 
 We can tie him up and gag him. 
 What if he gets loose? 
 He won't. 
 What if a hiker comes by and they call the police when we're in the camp? 
 No one hikes around here. 
 Phillip. 
 No. 
 [ Brakes hiss ] 
 Don't worry. 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 Shining city. 
 All right, Tom. 
 Step out of the truck for me, please. 
 Sure. 
 Open up the back for me, please. 
 Sure. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Sniffing ] 
 Heel, bud. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Dog whines ] 
 Jesus. 
 That smell is worse than the sh1t it covers up. 
 Yeah. 
 Have a good night. 
 You too. 
 Good boy. 
 [ Engine idling ] 
 [ In Spanish ] Ready! Ready! 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 [ Gunfire in distance ] 
 We're SEALS. We're supposed to know how to use a firearm. 
 Soldier #2: If you had taught him how to load that thing, there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge. 
 The guy nearly blew my foot off. 
 It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun. 
 No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these Contras. 
 We'd all be dead... 
 Five minutes. 
 Soldier : Shooters, you're gonna get a magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds. 
 A magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds. 
 All ready on the firing line! 
 All ready on the firing line! 
 Shooters, make ready! 
 [ In Spanish ] Shoot! 
 [ Gunfire ] 
 Cease fire! Cease fire! 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 Unload! It's all clear! 
 Shooters, with a magazine of 20 rounds, as you were, and a magazine with 30 rounds! 
 [ Camera shutter clicking ] Ho! 
 Shooters, you may commence fire when you see your target! 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 [ Silenced gunshot, thud ] 
 [ Silenced gunshot ] 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 What are you doing here? 
 Uh, just, uh, checking for drainage problems. 
 Out here? 
 Uh, you know what? 
 It's okay, 'cause, uh, I'm with septic. 
 Hey, hey! He's got a ca... 
 [ Muffled screaming ] 
 Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. 
 Quiet. 
 Quiet. 
 Shh. 
 [ Muffled screaming ] 
 [ Panting ] 
 Soldier : Is somebody out there? 
 [ Silenced gunshots ] 
 [ Gunfire in distance ] 
 [ Panting ] 
 Go. Go, go. 
 Give me your jacket. 
 Go, go. Come here, come here. 
 Okay. Go. 
 [ Vehicle door closes ] 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Radio chatter ] 
 [ Brakes squeak ] 
 [ Engine idling ] 
 [ Engine shuts off, vehicle doors open ] 
 [ Vehicle doors close ] 
 Security officer : You are being read into the Have Blue Program. 
 This is a top-secret US government project administered by the Department Of Defense. 
 You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday. 
 To get us here at all. 
 We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone. 
 Aaron : Not even our wives. 
 They have people watching our wives. You know that? 
 Making sure we haven't blabbed to them. 
 Well, I'm the guy that's gonna make sure that you don't. 
 Well, what do you know? 
 Not enough. 
 It sounds like science fiction, but you make planes invisible. 
 Project Harvey. 
 Which is...? 
 Stealth. 
 We can bring our planes and submarines right into Soviet territory without any detection. 
 The KGB kidnapped this man, Anton Baklanov, and took him back to the Soviet Union. 
 Was he the key to Stealth? 
 We don't know that man. 
 But he wasn't the key to it. 
 No one person has the key to anything. 
 Information is spread out through multiple departments and highly compartmented. 
 Classic definition of the left hand not knowing the right. 
 Soviets would have to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to put it all together. 
 And get through a hell of a lot of security. 
 The last meeting where all of the different groups actually met, each of us had two of our security guys watching our every move. 
 What meeting was that? 
 What meeting was that? 
 He is probably being tortured right now. 
 And once they realize he doesn't have everything they need, they will find out who  does. 
 You said that they would need to kidnap a hell of a lot of people to get to Stealth? 
 Well, that's exactly what they'll do. 
 They got to  him... 
 Circumvented dozens of FBI agents looking for him and sent him out of the country. 
 You think two DOD security guards can protect you or anybody else? 
 Think again. 
 Alexandria, Virginia... two months ago. 
 Who was there? 
 Uh, reps from Lockheed and Northrop. 
 They're competing against each other for the DOD contract. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Henry : Are we gonna start going to church  every  Sunday now? 
 Today's a special service. 
 It's... Teenage Sunday. 
 Youth Day. 
 Youth Day. 
 So we're  not  going every Sunday, then? 
 Oh! Dad! 
 I learned a new new trick. 
 Here... pick a card. 
 Not today. 
 [ Liquid pours ] Paige! 
 Here, pick a card. Any card. 
 Okay. 
 Put it in anywhere. 
 Paige : Well, you can't do it so that I can't see it. 
 Just a sec. 
 Here, just... 
 They're upside down. 
 No, they're not. 
 I can see it. You're cheating. 
 It's not cheating. It's called magic. 
 That's enough, Henry. 
 You know what? 
 We're gonna be late. 
 Yeah, let's go. 
 [ Dishes clatter ] 
 Tim : In John 10:10, Jesus tells us, "I came so that everyone would have life and have it in its fullest." 
 So, since God planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now, why are so many of us hurting and angry inside? 
 It's because we refuse to believe in God's unconditional love for us. 
 God created us in his image for one reason only... so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life. 
 That's it. 
 There's no catch. There's no hidden agenda. 
 The Lord sacrificed his only son for us, paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment. 
 Sounds too good to be true, but it isn't. 
 God's provided the way. 
 We must make the choice. 
 [ Indistinct talking ] 
 Excuse me. Paige! 
 Hi, sweetheart. 
 Wow. You look so beautiful. 
 You must be Paige's parents. 
 Such an honor to meet you. 
 Your daughter has been such a blessing to us. 
 She's a blessing to us, too. 
 Paige says you work in travel. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, we take a mission trip every year. We should talk. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah, we... yeah, we should. 
 We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips... see all the good her generous donations are doing. 
 We'll definitely talk about  that. 
 [ Elevator bell dings ] 
 Martha. 
 I was just about to ruin your Sunday and call you in to help me. 
 Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it. 
 What do you need? 
 There was a meeting between the DOD and Lockheed in Alexandria, Virginia on January 23rd. 
 There are surveillance reports on everyone who was at that meeting. 
 Anything relevant they have from that date, I want. 
 Tell them it's for Stan Beeman, and I have code-word clearance for the project. 
 I'll get right on it after I finish helping Agent Gaad pack. 
 Gaad : Thank you, Martha. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 Getting ready to answer questions in front of the Committee. 
 They told me to expect the call next week... after I testify. 
 [ Plaque thuds ] 
 I feel responsible, sir. 
 You  are  responsible, Agent Beeman. 
 So am I. 
 How can they come here, kill my partner, whoever they want, and you wind up... 
 Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence. 
 They  don't. 
 They're better at it than we are. 
 Patterson... kidnapped by the KGB right here in our capital city. 
 We have his sworn testimony... before he disappeared into thin air. 
 Elizabeth : $600?! That was all you had! 
 Who told you to do it? The pastor? His wife? 
 No one. 
 Stop protecting them. 
 I'm not protecting anybody! 
 Why do you think I can't make my own decisions? 
 You know why? 
 Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige. 
 You were saving that money to go to Europe. 
 Well, it's going to better use there. 
 What use? Do you know what they're using that money for? 
 They're feeding refugees, building houses. 
 You guys don't help  anyone! 
 We help  you. 
 W-we help you, and we helped you save that money. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Please do not roll your eyes at me. 
 You can show me some respect. 
 Paige, you started lying to us... 
 I didn't lie. 
 Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference. 
 Do  you? 
 You lie to us. You lie. 
 Dad! Stop! What are you doing?! 
 You go behind our backs. 
 Stop it! 
 Why?! Does this book tell you to do that?! 
 Phillip. 
 Does it?! 
 [ Thud ] 
 You respect Jesus, but not  us?! 
 [ Sniffling ] 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Emergency signal from Fred. 
 What happened last night... you didn't have a choice, Phillip. 
 This is war. 
 You think they would've done anything less to  us? 
 Reagan... 
 I don't need the speech. 
 I know it's war. 
 This is easier for  you. 
 You think it's easy for me, what I do? 
 [ Seagulls crying ] 
 The FBI called me this morning. 
 They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon. 
 Well, could this be a routine security check? 
 No one goes to DC for a  routine  security check. 
 Do you know if anyone else was called? 
 Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria. 
 I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there. 
 No. No. That would be suspicious. 
 All right. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 I'll just go in, then. 
 Look, you don't have to worry about me. 
 I'll be fine. 
 Paul... [ Clears throat ] 
 Emmett... Emmett taught me how to handle this situation. 
 Yeah, he was one of the best. 
 Yes, he was... 
 I miss him, too. 
 But  we're  working together now. 
 And you need to trust me. 
 You give me orders. I'll follow them. 
 But you inherited me. 
 You didn't... see something in me. 
 Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day. 
 And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal... they were fake. 
 Fake? 
 160 Soviet seamen died. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Oh, God. 
 They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one. 
 I keep thinking about all the planning it took. 
 And I wondered... did they even care how many people die? 
 This administration... the stuff they get away with makes me sick. 
 Yeah. 
 Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow. 
 Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those... kids that died. 
 [ Footsteps ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Elizabeth : Paige. 
 Go away. 
 Turn it off! 
 Get up. 
 Why? 
 Because I said so. 
 [ Cabinet door slams ] 
 Clean the refrigerator. 
 What? 
 You woke me up to clean the refrigerator? 
 Yes. 
 And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement. 
 I have school tomorrow. Why are you doing this? 
 You want to be a grown-up? 
 You want to spend money the way you want? 
 Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do... all the time. 
 It means working when you are exhausted and almost never getting what you want when you want it. 
 Your father and I never had a childhood. 
 Nothing came easy for us... ever. 
 You're so lucky, Paige. 
 Mop and bucket are in the basement. 
 You know who I am? 
 I do. 
 Then we can forgo the pleasantries. 
 This war has gotten very personal for me. 
 And I need you to listen carefully, because it affects you, too. 
 I'm listening. 
 I'm in a lot of trouble because your Soviet Foreign Minister won't accept that Vlad Kosygin was the tragic victim of a mugging gone wrong. 
 I could lose my job or even go to jail because of it. 
 If either of those things happens, I'll make sure you go down with me. 
 Uh, nothing. Thank you. 
 Before he disappeared, Richard Patterson gave a very detailed testimony about his kidnapping and torture by two KGB illegals. 
 The second my punishment is handed down, I'll release his classified testimony to the press. 
 Now, think of what that will mean for you and your people at the Rezidentura... all those deportations. 
 Moscow will not be pleased when they have to rebuild their US operation from scratch. 
 As we like to say in America, "Heads will roll"... your  head  being at the top of the list. 
 So... you see,  my  problem is now  your  problem. 
 I heard so much about you, Mr. Gaad. 
 I hoped that one day, we would have the chance to meet face-to-face. 
 I just wish it was under less trying circumstances. 
 Good day. 
 
 
 
 [ Seagulls crying ] 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You are here because the KGB is targeting you, your family, everyone and anyone you care about. 
 They won't get anything from  me. 
 They are masters at exploiting weakness. 
 We all have weaknesses. 
 We  all  do. 
 And they will find yours. 
 What do you need me to do? 
 We're gonna go through your file and go over all the parts of your life that make you the most vulnerable to them... financially, emotionally, sexually. 
 No, no, no. I-I'm not at all comfortable with this. 
 Well, it's not  my  first choice, either, but I'm going to need you to tell me things... secrets that you might not have told anyone else. 
 Because that is where their power lies... in secrets. 
 If they can keep you afraid and ashamed, then they can keep you silent. 
 And if they can keep you silent, they can control you. 
 Have you ever been engaged to be married? 
 No. 
 And how many close friends would you say you have? 
 Few. Not many. 
 Could you be more specific? 
 Uh, two, I think. 
 Um, you never really know enough about people, though. 
 So, are you... are you gonna say that because I'm a loner, I'm more vulnerable? 
 Look, I'm not sure how they will approach you, but I am sure that they  will. 
 All right. 
 But let me assure you, Agent Beeman... 
 I would never betray my country. 
 No one ever imagines they will. 
 Larrick : Riggs and Dubrow... What happened? 
 Official story... truck flipped in training. 
 But nobody can know about that base, so who knows what really happened? 
 Maybe some Contra went nuts. 
 [ People speaking Spanish in distance ] 
 Lisa : Today was a shitty day, with my shitty kids and my shitty husband. 
 I love them. I do, but damn, they get on my nerves. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 I wanted to... 
 Everyone knows what I want to do... what I want to do every second of every day. 
 I don't even have to say it. 
 But... then I remember the last drink that got me here 2 years, 1 month, 10 days ago. 
 And I didn't, and... 
 I'm just grateful, I guess... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 ...to have this place. 
 And that's all. 
 [ Applause ] 
 Um, the surveillance reports that you requested... 
 Alexandria, Virginia, the week of January 23rd. 
 There's a list of every person at the meeting and the names of all of their security personnel. 
 Thank you, Martha. 
 I included the local police reports from that area, as well, as the DOD meeting was on the same day as that horrible murder. 
 There was a ton of extra police around, so maybe someone saw something useful to you. 
 You mean that... couple and their... and their daughter? 
 That scared the hell out of me. 
 I thought it was a Charles Manson thing, but I think they've ruled that out. 
 You know what? 
 Get me all the files and physical evidence connected to those murders also. 
 Sure thing. 
 You think they're related? 
 I think I can't rule anything out. 
 [ Music plays ] 
 I thought we were through the hard times, you know? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'd been sick for about three months, uh, and he was just so amazing. 
 He took such great care of me and the kids, and... this is gonna sound weird. 
 Please.  My  life? No judgment. 
 It-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I... I wanted... the opportunity to show him that I could be there for  him,  you know? 
 I haven't always been. 
 [ Chuckling ] I've been going on and on. 
 You haven't. 
 This is what... recovery is all about... you know, opening up, being honest. 
 Okay. So, tell me about  you. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Uh, recovering drunk. 
 Wife, sister, mother. 
 Two kids... boy, 10, girl, 8. 
 Uh... I don't know. 
 Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking. 
 What kind of work do you do? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Assembly line... boring. 
 Come on. I told  you. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Went on and on and on. 
 Well, okay, okay. 
 Uh, it  is  boring. 
 Um, but it's super-high-security. 
 'Cause you mostly do government work. 
 It's a company called Northrop. 
 [ Doorknob turns ] 
 Hi. 
 Hey, handsome. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I just, um... 
 I wanted to see you. 
 I didn't want to go home. 
 Clark. 
 Uh, yeah, I know, I know. 
 This... [ Sighs ] 
 This  is  my home. [ Sighs ] 
 It is! 
 Rough day? 
 Y-yeah. 
 Were you... were you saving this? 
 No, no. It's fine. 
 But you don't usually drink, Clark. 
 What's wrong? 
 Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you? 
 Of course. 
 But with this job... 
 I can't always be as... honest as I would like. 
 Well, I know that. 
 Thing is, you  don't  know. 
 You don't know, so stop saying that you know. 
 Okay. 
 [ Cracks knuckles ] 
 It's okay that you have moods, Clark. 
 I'm not afraid of the different sides of you. 
 I love  all  of you. 
 The world is an ugly place, Martha. 
 And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Is he in more trouble? 
 He's probably gonna lose his pension... maybe even go to jail. 
 You shouldn't feel sorry for him. 
 Well, how can I not? 
 Martha. 
 This is tearing him apart. 
 Martha... 
 Gaad is not your friend. 
 [ Button clicks ] 
 Gaad :  Oh, come on, guys. Martha's ugly. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her. Samuels :  Ew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head. [ Chuckles ] [ Button clicks ] Bastards. I know. I know. [ Crying ] [ Sighs ] Do they always talk about me that way? Oh, my God. I shouldn't have played it. No, it's-it's better that I know... who they really are. Martha, I-I've never been any good at seduction or romance. But I love the way you look. I love every part of you. And if I could, I would go in there, and I would... [ Sighs ] [ Sniffles ] I know you would, Clark. [ Sniffles ] But I have a job. [ Sighs ] A very important job. [ Sighs deeply ] And things are a lot worse than you know. What? Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth? No. It's a huge, complex military project. I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out... we think... of your office. We've found it very difficult to find a source. What do you need? [ Sighs ] I so appreciate that. I really do. Let me help you, Clark. No, it's dangerous. I'm not afraid. Do I love you? [ Gasps ] You know you're everything to me. And you to me. [ Sniffles ] You are. [ Sniffles ] Oh. [ Both moaning ] [ Both breathing heavily ] What? Do you want me to use my mouth? No. What? What's wrong? I've... I'm... I'm just too upset. And I've had too much to drink. I have to go. Well, Clark, you don't have to leave. Yes, I do. [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] Dr. Ruth:  If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the v*g1n* and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier, the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem. What you also can do is actually help him insert the pen1s into the v*g1n*, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go... Mind if I turn it off? No. Go ahead. I'll tell you what... if the two of you love each other... [ Button clicks ] You going somewhere? Uh, my mom's. Oh. Did you mention that? I-I don't remember. She's not feeling that well. Aw, no. I'm sorry. No, it's nothing serious. I just haven't seen her in a while, so... I thought that... [ Sighs ] My mom is not sick. [ Sighs ] She's not sick. [ Sighs ] Okay. Where you going? Away. With a man I met from EST. What do you mean, "Away"? Away. I don't know. Uh, for a few days. We've, um... [ Sighs ] had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there. You're telling me you're going to have an affair? Sandra? I might. I don't know. At least I'm being honest. Go ahead. Tell me that you're  not  having an affair. I'm... You know what kills me about the whole thing? Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on... you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius. You just didn't see it? So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention. Who is he? Oh, it doesn't matter, really. Who is he, Sandra? Who is he? It doesn't matter who he is. What are you gonna do... go arrest him? [ Crying ] [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] Sandra. [ Voice breaking ] Sandra. Are you leaving me? [ Chuckles ] That would be easy for you, wouldn't it? You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at EST. [ Sighs ] No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan, but I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave  me. Mr. Jennings. Can I help you? As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can. [ Door closes ] Have a seat, please. I won't be staying long. What is it you want? I want you to stay away from my daughter. You want her to stop coming to church? That's right. That's between you and Paige. Well, I... I think you can help with that, and I think you  will  help with that. I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings. It's a sanctuary. I can't turn  anyone  away. [ Chuckling ] That's the whole point of this place. Is something wrong? You took $600 from her. I thought you knew about that. We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve. I-I'll write you a check right now if you want, but... that's not why you're here. No, it's not. Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings? For $600? For your daughter? I would do anything for my daughter. I would do  anything  for my daughter. The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger. I'm not here to be saved... not by you, Tim... or your god. I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings. There  is  grace and forgiveness for you. For everyone. Do you believe that? [ Sighs ] I do. [ Door closes ]
