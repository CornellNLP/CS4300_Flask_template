 Previously on The Americans... 
 Amador : Directorate S undercover agents supposedly hiding all over the US. 
 Super-secret identities... no one has any idea who they are. 
 [ Doorbell rings ] 
 Oh, hi. You came! 
 Just for a second, to bring over brownies and welcome you to the neighborhood. 
 What do you do, Stan? 
 I'm an FBI agent. 
 Elizabeth : When we got here, I was 22 years old. 
 Living in a strange house in a strange country with a strange man. 
 It never really happened for us. 
 You're separating? 
 Gaad : It's time you and your source started having your meetings in a safe house. 
 That is our own private cabana. 
 I appreciate what you're trying to do. 
 It's not gonna fix anything. 
 Big day at FBI Counterintelligence? 
 Martha : They were in the secure vault all day. 
 Did you get a look inside this time? 
 There's one move we could make. 
 We put a bug in Gaad's office. 
 Martha could do it. 
 No knock on your charms there, Romeo, but there's no way she'll go for that. 
 I pronounce you man and wife. 
 I'm in love with you, and I would do anything for you. 
 Mom. 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 Laundry. You're doing laundry in the middle of the night? We know that we're looking for a Caucasian man and woman. It's a couple. Take them! [ Tires screeching ] It's okay. Look at me. Look at me! Her great-aunt? She fell down the stairs. Elizabeth may stay up for a while and take care of her. [ Insects chirping ] I wish they'd listen to me. I'll be all right. Hey... if you ever need me again... [ Engine turns over ] [ Gasps ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Middle Eastern music plays ] We let them have Kabul for now, attack their supply routes using small units, always moving fast. Right. [ Southern accent ] Well, I told the coordinating committee what you asked for, and the response was very positive. Of course, they need to clear about 15 other committees every time we go over a million dollars. Look, boys, we know you're good in Herat. The question is, how do we help you out in Panjshir? [ Speaking native language ] [ Speaking native language ] We have a route on the Rukha... on the Saricha road. [ Speaking native language ] You get the weapons to us from across the border, we do the rest. Right. [ Speaking native language ] We love America. With your guidance and with the help of Allah, we will drive the godless Soviets from Afghanistan. And we are gonna be there for you every step of the way. Money, guns... America is gonna get you whatever you need, Salar. [ Speaking native language ] [ Speaking native language ] It's good to have the same enemy. Yes, it is. This blade is my gift to you. I killed a Russian soldier with it. It was the first man I ever killed. It was hard, but it has gotten easier. We'll kill every heathen come to humiliate us on our own land. Really? [ Muffled gunshots ] Aah! [ Glass shatters ] You tell your brothers back in Afghanistan there is a message for them. [ Muffled gunshot ] America can't protect you, Allah can't protect you, and the KGB is everywhere. [ Both grunting ] [ Screams ] [ Screams ] You Russians have no idea who you're... It's okay. [ Muffled gunshot ] Aah! [ Engine turns over, revs ] ♪ just how you broke my heart, oh, so many times ♪ [ Radio clicks off ] [ Sighs ] You ready? [ Horn honks ] [ Horn honks ] Mom! Happy birthday, Henry! Don't jump on your mother! You're getting too big now. I miss being jumped on. Mwah! You look older to me. I am. Does our house look the same? Yeah. We painted the living room black. [ Laughs ] Stop it. You did not. Yeah, we did. Happy birthday! I'm just saying you have to eat something substantial, something like real food before cake. Okay, okay. What do you want? Hot dog? I'll have a hot dog, yeah. Okay. One hot dog, please. Thanks. For the birthday boy. Man : Okay, here you go. Well, maybe next year, you know? Hopefully you can afford it, because this is your 100% refund. Wow. I really wasn't expecting anything back. Definitely not all of it. Well, I'm just sorry it took so long, but the airline has this whole voucher BS, so it takes forever, but that's no reason to pay for a trip you're not gonna go on. [ Party horn blows ] Thanks. I definitely owe you one. It's great she's back, huh? You have no idea. It's good to see you guys together again. Just give it time. I'm sure you'll get there. Yeah. Philip : It's 12 times more powerful than your old one. Oh! [ Hesitantly ] It's great. Well, that didn't sound very convincing. No. No, no, it is, it is. Thank you. It's just not Intellivision. Hey! Wait. What are you talking about? Henry keeps begging dad for this video game. Yeah, which rots your brain, turns it into this. Hmph. And you wanted a new telescope. I know. Let's go set it up in my room. Oh, you know what? Uh, maybe tomorrow night? Abby's gonna be here in 15 minutes. Why? I'm gonna take your mom out on a date. Tonight? It's my birthday. I know. - We're gonna do a whole Henry weekend, sweetheart. Yeah. It will be really fun. Promise. We just need a little time. Don't you want mom and dad to go out on a date? Yeah. I missed her, too, pal. I did. Oh, gross. Come on, Paige. [ Both breathing heavily ] Air Force Security. Don't move. Nice and slow, nice and slow, nice and slow, now. What?! Get your clothes. - Move. Nice and slow. Easy, easy. Come on. This way. Move, move. Back it up. Roy Oatway, Roy Oatway, Air Force Security. Come on. Take a breath. You're fine. Calm down. Roy, you're fine. Look at me. Look at me. Take 'em to lockup. Nobody interrogate 'em till we get back. [ Breathes heavily ] I haven't done anything. Let me ask you a question, Roy. When you were in high school, in Topeka, did two cheerleaders ever ask you to go at it with them under the bleachers? When you were at MIT, did two gorgeous women ever pick you up at a bar, take you home, and screw your brains out? It's a question, Roy. It's a real question. No. What about when you were chief budget officer for Bendix Corporation, overseeing antilock-brake technology? How many babes were you banging then, Roy? Um... not a lot. What do you think's so different about tonight, Roy? New cologne? Or is it just since you started working for Lockheed? Do you think it could have some connection to your security clearance and the skunk works project they're working on for the DOD? I-I didn't tell them anything. You're lucky we got here. Am I under arrest? No, Roy, you're not under arrest. We're not here to arrest you. We're here to protect you and your company and the interests of the United States military, but you're gonna have to be more careful from now on. So this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna take apart, we're gonna reconstruct every step of your security protocol, starting right here, right now. You are gonna be scrupulous about your phone logs, report every new suspicious social encounter, especially when you're traveling. And you're gonna switch out the codes on your office safe and briefcase to a rotating-number system we give you that's gonna change every six weeks. Okay? You're fine. Put your clothes on. Well, you'd never know it. John... Don't worry about it. You're certainly never gonna be replaced by a syndicated show. You are el numero one. Now, haven't I always said that? Every time you want something, yes. Ha! What do you want, Herb? Just the use of that oh, so persuasive voice of yours for just 3 little 60-second spots. Eh, forget it, pal. I'm out of here. The guy asked for you, John. Well, I'm sorry, Herb. Just tell him the doctor is not for sale. Almost forgot... there's a talent fee... $35 a spot. Sold. [ Henry screams ] [ Laughs ] What the hell?! What are you doing? I'm checking mom's laundry. You're checking her laundry? [ Sighs ] Doing it. I'm doing mom's laundry for her. Why? As a surprise. Whatever. Weirdo... [ Sighs ] That's a long time to be away. Yeah. Well, I mean, I was pretty torn up. How are the kids doing? Um, you know, we talked every week. They wondered why I wasn't coming home on weekends, but I just told them my aunt was too sick, I couldn't leave. Must have been strange not seeing them. It was hard, but everyone's okay. And you and Philip? We're better. Yeah. Good? Yeah. When do you guys head back? Uh, I pick up my guy's drop on Saturday, then the Air and Space Museum, then drive late Sunday night for school Monday. Jared's a senior? He's going to Carnegie Mellon next year... engineering. Philip : Oh, wow. I mean, the last time we saw you guys, you were worried he was spending too much time building model airplanes. I guess he was an engineer after all. Mechanical, like his dad. And Amelia? Ninth-grade, cheerleading. Oh, my God, no. Yes! So most of our mother/daughter time is spent cooking for the bake sales. And then there's boys, boys, boys. Nothing much else to worry about, these kids. Nothing prepares you for them growing up... here. You guys are staying in Alexandria, right? You know, uh, we're taking the kids to the rides at the park on Saturday. I'd love to get a look at Paige and Henry. Well, then, we'll see you there. We'll be there all day. Listen, Claudia sends her regards. She's glad you're okay. She told us about what happened between you. She's still here? You know those old war-horses. They don't get pushed around so easily. [ Engine turns over ] You okay? At least you got to be here for Henry's birthday. Yeah. That worked out. Yeah. You okay? Yeah. I had a... thing last night. Finished up an operation with some Afghans. Went bad. Henry? Henry, I don't think mom and dad came home. I don't care. [ Gasps ] Oh, my God. Get back in your room, Henry. [ Doors slam ] Henry : So, he got the whole apple in his mouth, but it got stuck, and Lewis and Jeremy started tickling him, and I got worried he might choke. I mean, you can choke on an apple, and he was laughing really hard. So I made them stop, and we had to cut the apple out of his mouth in pieces. He said the next night, his jaw really still hurt. I bet. Yeah. Oh, Paige, we got to go. Oh, uh, sweetheart, hang on a second. Um... privacy and respect... this is why we have those rules. I know. Why would you open a closed door? 'Cause I missed you, mom, and I'm sorry. Well, I missed you, too, honey. And... and things are gonna get back to normal now. They are. Yeah. But we have to be able to trust each other, okay? I know. I'm sorry. It's okay. It is okay. Go get your things for school. Thank you for doing my laundry. Henry : Let's go, Paige. [ Door opens, closes ] Come on! [ Sighs ] What do you think? Who knows what's going on in that little head? It will probably be a while before she walks in on us again. Based on what she saw last night, I'm surprised she even came downstairs this morning. Yeah. [ Sighs ] Do we even know if this is the first time she's checked on us? Do you need to switch seats? I'm okay. Trails grow cold, Stan, especially when the people you're chasing are dead or gone. I don't know. Do you trust your source? Yes. So... she died, and he's been exfiltrated. It's just been a couple of months. We have to wait for the next break. I've never been very good at waiting, sir. [ Buzzer ] He's here again. Said he wouldn't leave until he talked to you. I had them send him up. You want me to have security throw him out? Uh... no. I'll meet him by the elevators. I'll be right back. 
 
 [ Beeping ] [ Sighs ] You promised me! We had a deal! It was signed! Shut up, shut up. I'm not gonna shut up! $500,000. I did my part. I want my money. The thing is, you didn't do your part, Sandford. Not one of your leads panned out. We got nothing from you. I g... I gave you the illegal. I gave you Colonel Rennhull. I gave you everything. Listen to me... your illegal with the Morticia Addams hair and the hot skirts is a fantasy you've been jerking off to as far as we can tell. She doesn't exist. No, she's real! And Colonel Rennhull reported your approach to Air Force Security the following day. He said a creepy guy from the Pentagon asked him if he'd be interested in meeting with the KGB. That's bullshit. He described you to a T. That's bullshit. He was covering his tracks. He went for it! Well, maybe, but you're a compulsive gambler with a very dubious record at DOD, and he is clean as a whistle. So read the agreement. It's contingent on us getting something for our money. I gave you everything I had. You people betrayed me. [ Elevator bell dings ] Don't come back here, Sandford, unless it's to thank me for keeping your ass out of lockup. Every word I said to you was the truth! Stan : I believe him. Military intelligence doesn't agree. Well, that's because he's a scumbag traitor whose personal life is a mess. But that doesn't mean... Let it go, Stan. If the Colonel stays there in his office with his clearance, it's gonna come back on us... bad. The Colonel is off-limits. My rope is more than used up. This is how it works when they want you to do something,  but they can't ask you to do it. It goes wrong, they start investigating you. Soviet Foreign Minister wasn't pleased that one of his diplomats got shot in the back of the head. Sir, his body was found in a dumpster. DC is a dangerous place. The state keeps asking questions, I can't really give any answers. Someone might have to take the fall for this. Someone always takes the fall. [ Telephone rings ] Agent Gaad's office. For now, be smart with the Colonel. The less attention we attract, the better. Yes, sir. I don't suppose that's ready, is it? Mm-hmm. It is? Philip, you want to take this home for the kids? Uh, can you just wrap two slices? And then, uh, you and Barb can split the rest. Uh, my roommate is on a diet. He'd kill me if I bring home cake. You had a good couple of months. Yeah, we did. This is Stan here, right? This one? Yeah. I thought we got him a refund. No. I got him the voucher. Traded it in for 40%. We paid the difference. I figured in the long run... Good. Yeah. Agent Beeman, what I'm showing you, not a lot of people know about. If word gets out... You can trust me. It's evidence. I-I-I understand. So, these guys are pirating new stuff out in the theaters now? Yep. We already had three raids on them. Expecting another shipment next week. What's this one? Uh, guys on motorcycles after the world's destroyed. Pretty good, but if you want to make her cry, show her this. It'll bore you to tears, but your wife will love it. I have set myself beyond the pale. I am nothing. I am hardly human anymore. I am the French Lieutenant's... whore. You don't like it? No. I think it's good. You believe her? The woman? The actress. Well, that's Meryl Streep. What? You think she's too what? I think she's too much of what a man thinks a woman is, what he wants her to be. Well, if she loves him, does it make her a whore? Was Anna Karenina a whore because she gave her heart, her life to Vronsky? "Anna Karenina"... you heard of this book? Yeah, I heard of it. I never had the pleasure. Is that how you see me, what I am to you? A whore? No, it's a movie, Nina. I th... I thought you'd like it. You thought it would make me cry. No. I... I thought it would move you. [ Voice breaking ] Well, you see I'm very moved. Are you happy now? Nina... We have a new arrival at the Rezidentura. Really? Oleg Igorevich Burov. First-tour officer, but in charge of Line X... science and technology. What do you think of him? [ Speaks Russian ] He's a bad mattress. Too soft. [ Chuckles ] You think you can find out his specific target? I can listen, maybe ask a few questions. Be careful. [ Creatures wailing, growling ] [ Both scream ] [ Laughs ] Oh, my God. [ Screams ] [ Laughing ] Stop! Oh, my God. Come on. Let's get, um... [ All screaming ] [ Laughs ] Make him stop! Go! Come on! Woman : Go, Jared, go, Jared, go, Jared, go, Jared. [ Grunts ] You're there! You're still winning! Go. [ Laughs ] Do you like this side? I got, like, flowers. Oh! Do you like it? The butterfly. I love it, I love it. I just had it done. [ Bell ringing ] Ah! [ Laughing ] Jared. Hey, dad, you want this? Oh, sure. It's gonna look great in our bedroom. Uh, can... can we go back to the hotel so I can go swimming? We'll head back in a little while. Come on, guys, I want to go on the bumper cars. [ Sighs ] Oleg Igorevich. Beeman! We need to take a drive. Drive? To the Colonel's house. Clear. Colonel Rennhull. Agent Gaad. Agent Beeman. Thank you both for coming. Are you all right? [ Sighs ] I guess. He just showed up and started screaming, "I'm gonna kill you, you ruined my life," something about $500,000. He was crazy. My wife's inside. He just started coming at me. You had the weapon on you? I got it when I saw him pull in the drive. I mean, he's the guy. He's the one who approached me that I reported. Yes, he is. I really should get back inside. My wife is not good. Of course. You take care. Give me a minute, guys. Yes, sir. You'd think one in the head would have been enough. Yeah. Oh, my God, mom. It's like she knows you. Henry : Yeah. Can she do me next? I'll read your palm, Henry. Ah. Short, dweeb-like. I'll, uh, see you at the balloon dart. I'm just gonna grab some water. My agent called the service. The surveillance is tight, and you can't do a dead drop. I had to change things up. I've got him coming here to do a pass, and it can't be me. I've been on him for the last two days. His tails might have seen me. When? About three minutes. He's in gray pants, gray blazer, green tie with white pattern. He's gonna be looking for a blue hat and an 11-year-old boy. We don't use our kids. It's just a brush pass. He's got two tails on his surveillance team about five feet behind him. They won't look twice at a father with his child, but you alone they might notice. You need the cover. We have to move. Leanne will block for you. After you get it, do 45 minutes of clearing on your own, then bring the package to my hotel, room 1123. I may have to run the kids somewhere, so wait for me if I'm not back there. His operational report sounds bad. I'm gonna need you guys' help to take out his surveillance team so I can get him out. Take out? We have our children here. So do we. Two minutes. [ Cheering ] Henry! [ Laughs ] Hey, you try. You know what? Let's get some ice cream for the girls. All right. I want the duck! Hey, where'd you get the hat? Like it? Yeah. We should get Capitals hats. [ Balloon pops ] You promised you were gonna take me to get ice cream. I am. Neil's father's a lawyer. He has season tickets. You should make friends with him. You should make friends with Neil. [ Laughs ] Oh! There you are. Listen, last ride, then back to the hotel, okay? What the hell was that about? I'll tell you on the way. Let's go. I'll give the kids money for more rides. Great. [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Knock on door ] [ Knocking continues ] Emmett. [ Elizabeth gasping ] Paige and Henry... go. [ Gasps ] [ Whistling ] Jared : [ Screaming ] No, no! No! Oh, my God! [ Sobbing ] Elizabeth : Henry?! Henry?! Hen? What? Wait. Where's Paige? Um, she just took off. Uh, okay. Come with me. Um, but, mom, I wanted to ride again. I know, I'm sorry. It's time to go. We just have to find your sister. [ Riders screaming ] Paige! Hi, mom. [ Gasps ] Why didn't you stay with your brother? I just wanted to get my face painted. Guys! Come on. It's getting late. Sorry. Let's go. Are you guys okay? Yeah, yeah. Just... just been looking for you, that's all. [ Cap clatters ] [ Pills rattle ] [ Dead bolt clicks ] [ Window locks click ] There's nothing in the operational report, just routine surveillance, but there's an address in Virginia two hours south of the naval base and these sketches. Looks like a propeller, machine tool, something. Well, whatever it is, Emmett and Leanne were in a hell of a hurry to get it. I know. I'll go... I'll go signal now. No, no. You, uh... you rest up. I'll do it. [ Sighs ] I should have done it without Henry, even if I was more exposed. You didn't have time to think. You're supposed to be with Martha tonight. No, no. I'm gonna make an excuse. No. If the FBI were part of this, if they know about this, we need to find out. You need to go. I'll stay up. Who would do this? You want the list? [ Dog barking ] Someone who knows us, every single one of us, someone who was on to the operation, in which case they may or may not have caught us at the end of it, someone who had surveillance on the operation that we missed. That's half the list. You want me to finish it? Not really. Elizabeth... I'll be back as soon as I can. I know. Somewhere along the line, encounter yourself, shake hands and say, "Hi, where the hell have you been all these years?!" Well, now that we're together... Stan? Hey. What are you doing here? Uh, I had to talk to somebody in Arlington. Wasn't worth driving back to the office. Where's Matthew? Uh, he's having dinner at Craig's. I didn't know you'd be home. I made plans to see a movie with Trish and Marie. It's okay. I can heat up leftovers before I go, or there's French-bread pizza in the freezer. That's all right. I'm... not really hungry. Look like you've never looked before. Hear like you've never heard before. Feel like you've never felt before! Who is that? Leo Buscaglia. He's... Well, they call him the "Love Doctor." He says you can change the whole world with a hug. Really? Mm-hmm. Looks like he's trying to change his world with a pledge drive. It's for PBS, not him. Mm. You know, he says that the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. Okay. He says that love is always open arms, that if you close your arms to love that... you'll find you're left just holding only yourself. Anyway, that's what he's famous for. Do you want to come with us... to the movies? Uh... sure. I knew it was ordained that I should never marry an equal, so... I married shame. It is my shame that has kept me alive, my knowing that I am truly not like other women, why I shall never, like them, have children, a husband, and the pleasures of a home. Sometimes I pity them. I have a freedom they cannot understand. No insult, no blame can touch me. Philip : It's just hard... this job, this life. It gets to you in ways you didn't think it would. And it isn't easy for me to talk about this, but I sometimes wonder if I'm cut out for this. I don't know. I can't get into it. It was just, um... it was a hard day. It was a bad day. It's okay, sweetie. Just relax. Relax. Hmm? You're home now. [ Sighs ]
