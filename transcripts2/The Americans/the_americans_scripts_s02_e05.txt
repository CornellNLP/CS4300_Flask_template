 [ Knock on door ] 
 Emmett? 
 Claudia : You have to help me find Emmett and Leanne's killer. 
 Andrew Larrick... Emmett and Leanne were blackmailing him. 
 He's homosexual. 
 To get to Larrick, you'll need an airtight cover. 
 Brad Mullin... Seaman Recruit working out of Dam Neck in Virginia Beach. 
 Paige, what is this? 
 I'm reading the Bible. 
 What is the Reed Street Church? 
 I'm allowed to have my own life! 
 And we are allowed to know about it! 
 I'm filling out this application, and there's this line here, and they want my marital status and my husband's name. 
 I'm putting your name down, Clark. 
 You're my husband, and it's the truth. 
 He is a brilliant physicist and an eloquent advocate for those Jewish Refuseniks still trapped in the Soviet Union. 
 We're taking the scientist.

 Hanson : Well, I filled it out, Clark, and I'm assuming that since you didn't call me back, this is okay with you. 
 Anyway, you know what time I leave for work in the morning. 
 So call me. 
 [ Click ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Paige : Come in. 
 Hey. What's up? 
 Homework. What do you think? 
 What are you reading? 
 Don't worry. It's not the Bible. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I don't care what you're reading. 
 I just... I don't want you hiding things. 
 [ Telephone ringing ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Footsteps depart ] 
 [ Ringing continues ] 
 Hello? 
 George : May I speak with Miss Jennings? 
 This is  Mrs.  Jennings. 
 This is Allan Petrie with Columbia House Record Club. 
 I'm calling to discuss your husband's account, which is now three months overdue. 
 [ Rustling ] 
 Philip : So, you'd rather be here with me... than arrested by the Washington police. 
 That's an interesting choice. 
 Anton's mistress was well-trained. 
 Ohh! Ugh! 
 Is that where it hurts? 
 [ Grunts, breathing heavily ] 
 So, what... Anton wants a... 
 [ Grunts ] 
 ...a playmate, you get him a playmate? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Throw some shekels his way, too, hmm? 
 He couldn't have been too hard to turn. 
 I mean, he loves America, but he  loves  you, too. 
 [ Tape tearing ] 
 [ Siren wails in distance ]

 [ Groans ] 
 You're almost done.

 [ Normal voice ] What are you... the Kenny Rogers of Tel Aviv? 
 [ Thud ] 
 Haifa. 
 [ Sighs ] I'm cold. 
 Yeah, you're in shock. 
 You took my jacket. 
 It's cold in here. You see? 
 Icicles. 
 So, is this what you Jews do... you spy on your friends? 
 America isn't our friend. America is our father... who thinks we're not ready to drive his fast car. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 So, sometimes when he's not looking, we get behind the wheel, and we take it for a spin. 
 [ Footsteps approach ] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. [ Door closes ] 
 [ Dog barking in distance ] 
 That's pretty good. 
 Well, they say that drawing helps you find the parts of yourself that you've lost. 
 [ Pencil scratching ] 
 Is that an EST thing? 
 No... soul retrieval. 
 Soul... retrieval? 
 Yeah, a friend of mine told me about it from EST. 
 You're making new friends. 
 [ Telephone ringing ] 
 Hello? 
 Halliwell : It's Jim Halliwell. 
 Sir. 
 Got a call from campus security at GW. 
 One of their scientists... his wife says he hasn't come home tonight. 
 There's a note in his file that says to call us if anything suspicious happens with him. 
 What field's he in? 
 Physics. [ Sighs ] 
 Look, I hate to ruin your night, but, uh, with what happened last year, I hear "scientist," and I figure... 
 You're absolutely right. On my way in. 
 Very good. 
 It's... 
 [ Rhythmic knocking on door ] 
 [ Rhythmic knocking on door ] 
 [ Door opens ] 
 I came as soon as I got word. 
 I'm Kate, Claudia's replacement. 
 What do you have? 
 Food. Medical supplies. 
 Put them here. 
 I'm honored to work with you. 
 Keep your voice down. 
 I will do my best to assist you. 
 Your best? 
 What is this... your first assignment? 
 Claudia was the most experienced handler in Directorate S, and you found her unacceptable. 
 The Centre wants you happy. 
 I  want you happy. 
 We're one block from where we took him,  and  we've been seen by the police. 
 I have a Mossad agent in the other room. 
 I'm not interested in "your best." 
 I need results, so start by getting me a new safe house. - Okay. 
 And tell the Centre if they want Baklanov, Moscow will have to make a deal with the Israelis. 
 I'll let them know right away. 
 Good. 
 Go. [ Door opens ] 
 Joyce :  I'm so tired of being jerked around by that murdering savage. 
 Frank :  - Joyce. 
 I have to be honest about it, Frank. 
 I want to see Harmon punished to the absolute limit of the law. 
 I want revenge for Pamela. [ Knock on door ] Frank, I don't know if I want to do my job any... [ TV shuts off ] Hmm. Jennifer, hi! Is he here? Who... Clark? He's not, is he? [ Sighs ] I can't believe him. I mean... it's just... it's so rude. Um... would you like to come in? I hate barging in on you like this. No, no! Please, please come in. I was just, um... Would you like a glass of wine? Oh. Sure. Yes? I have white... and... and white. That sounds great. Okay. [ Chuckles ] You know, I should have called. I really should have, but I realized it's crazy. I do not have your phone number, and you're not listed. Well, it's still under my maiden name. Oh. Luckily, I had your address. But, um, you know, it's just so typical Clark. So, he didn't mention... Did you even know I was in town? No. Thank you. I guess it was a little bit last-minute. I got in yesterday. I'm staying at his apartment. - Oh. And he mentioned that we would all get together tonight, the three of us... and then he goes and pulls a Clark. What... Didn't show up or... Didn't even call. [ Scoffs ] So, I'm there. I'm waiting. Thank you... I'm waiting, and then I hear your phone messages. Oh. And I just felt awful. You're very sweet. No, I couldn't stand another second of it, so... Is it okay that I'm here? You would tell me, right? You know, I'm glad that you came. I think... I think was getting a little crazy, so... Oh, Clark can do that... make a person crazy. I mean, I love him to death, but, my lord. [ Chuckles ] Is he like that with you, too? Oh, he's like that with everybody! I mean, he's such a great, great guy, but... he's just missing that one little thing. You know what I mean? I do. I do. Yeah. It's just those few missing notes when it comes to social graces. Yeah. He's always been that way. If I'm saying too much, you're gonna stop me, right? [ Chuckling ] No, no, no. Believe me, I'm  dying  to know... dying. [ Chuckles ] According to Mrs. Baklanov, the guy doesn't have much of a social life. Family, temple, bathhouse... that's about it. Who doesn't love a good shvitz? She's not too clear on the details of his work but says he claims to be a real-life David Copperfield. What the hell's that supposed to mean? Makes things invisible. That's all I got. Where do you want us to start? Phone records. Already got the last week's worth from his office. Need them from anyplace he might have been the last few days. [ Beeping ] His wife gave me a list. Man : We don't have those. [ Sighs ] Icicles. Never saw them till I was posted here. After an ice storm, you see them in the trees, hanging. You probably had that back home, didn't you, Mr. KGB man? I don't remember. Even so... I'd rather die with a view of the Mediterranean. [ Chuckles, inhales deeply ] Not that we get to pick and choose. Was supposed to be an easy posting, America. [ Scraping ] Nothing's easy. Very true. [ Chuckles ] My mother, she... She survived the pogroms. Her tough-guy son from the kibbutz can't even survive Washington. You're not dead yet. Ah, I've got a fever. I can feel it. I'm... I'm talking like I have a fever. Anyway [Sighs] a few hours from now, you'll put a bullet in my head. They'll make a deal. I can't tell if you're being kind or naive. We get what we want. We want Anton. So if we can't find him, we'll trade you for him. Would your government make that trade for  you? I don't know. Me, I know. I'm not being modest. I'm worth something. But I'm bronze, not platinum, not like you. I go home for Passover. [ Chuckles ] I sing country-western with an accent. I hide what I do. I don't hide who I am. [ Hands scrape ] Oops! Empty. [ Slurring ] Now, should I open another? Why not? Yeah, why not? [ Sighs ] So, did Clark tell you about the job application? Um... no, but, um... I heard your messages. And I know he's pretty serious about that stuff. He sure is. You know, that's what I'm gonna do. What? I'm gonna hand it in "Married"... check! Where is the corkscrew? Ah. "Husband, Clark Westerfeld"... double check. [ Chuckles ] Husband's occupation? Hall monitor for the goddamn FBI! [ Both laugh ] Martha... can I be a little bit of a Betty Butt-insky? Yes, Jennifer, you're family. I just... I know Clark, and I know how much his job means to him. But I'm his wife! I should mean more to him than some dumb job! And you do. I know you do, but... [ Sighs ] It's none of my business. Mm. No, you know what? Okay. Go ahead. It's just not some dumb job. You know that. Probably more than I do. And if you check "Married," then they'll do a background on Clark. [ Sighs ] And he's not allowed to be married to anyone inside the department. I know. I suppose it's not like me lying on the form would get  me  thrown in jail... or anything. Martha... he loves you so much. He does, doesn't he? Hmm. And you love him. I do. I really do. It's just, he's so... Exasperating. Yes! God, you're easy to talk to, you know? I'm really surprised. [ Laughing ] Hey! [ Laughing ] Oh, no! I'm sorry! It's just, I mean, Clark's so uptight, you know, like, fuss-fuss-fussy! [ Laughing ] Fussy! Well, you know, except when we're... you know. Oh, no! How would you know? Of course you don't know. [ Laughs ] Oh, you mean... Oh! Oh. You know what? I'm gonna... I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about your very big brother. Oh. Okay? He's an animal. Oh. Really? Really. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Jennifer. Oh, my God. But, it's... uh, I mean, it's not like I've been with a thousand guys or anything, right? But I've been with enough to compare him to. And let me tell you, he's wild. Wow. Yeah. Hmm. I don't even know where it comes from, the... some of the things that he does? Mm. [ Cackling ] What, um... [ Sighs ] What does he do? [ Slurring ] Well, um... you know, your brother... he's a gentleman. He's a gentleman. It's just not in the sack. In the sack, he... [ Sighs ] he just makes me his. Hmm. Mm. I got a "Shots fired" in Shaw. Anybody have any calls that aren't on the board yet? Brooks? Nope. Loeb? Nothing. Agent Gaad. What brings you here? I heard a physicist with a clearance went missing. Thought I could help. I called him, sir. All right. [ Sighs ] Beeman, why don't you give him a stack? What have you got? Anton Baklanov. Told his wife he'd be home by 7:30. Signed out of his office at 5:00. No one's heard from him? No, sir. These are records from any phone he might have used in the last few days. Number shows up on more than one phone or more than one day, that's a blue pin. Red are disturbance calls to MPDC after 5:00 PM tonight. Blue and red show up on the same place... Got it. I'd forgotten the heart-stopping thrills. Plus, we've got the vending machines. Mm. [ Snores, sighs ] 
 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] Hey. Halliwell wasn't too happy I came around. He just didn't expect you. I know the look. I've used it myself. "Make yourself at home. Just stay out of my way." So, I talked to the chairman of Baklanov's department at GW. He said he was working on some kind of government contracts, but he didn't know anything about it. Let me put on my "big surprise" face. So, I asked our guys downstairs where the notification order on Baklanov came from. Took 'em two hours to dig up an answer. Came from DOD. I called over there, but, I mean, how long do you think it's gonna take 'em to get back to me? So I'm  not  here to help you go through crime reports and phone records? Hardly, sir. Let me see what I can find out. Man : Mr. KGB man. I need to sh1t. [ Sighing ] [ Grunts, scoffs ] Uh, some help. [ Sighs ] [ Zipper opens ] [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] Do you think you could leave me alone for a minute? Is that what  you'd  do? [ Chuckles ] [ Urinating ] [ Grunting ] [ Grunts, sighs ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Clears throat ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Sighs ] [ Both grunting ] [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] [ Grunts ] [ Both breathing heavily ] Sorry. You know I had to try. Yeah. [ Screams ] Oleg Igorevich. Oleg Igorevich... Stan! I called DOD Security. Then I went over there. Talked to the duty officer, made him wake up the lieutenant in charge. He got some colonel somewhere to pull the file. And? Stonewalled. It's like  I'm  the KGB. He said it's code-word clearance, and I don't have it. Whatever he's working on, they sure don't want to talk about it. Well, he's been missing for over 12 hours now, so I'm guessing somebody talked about it. [ Sea gulls crying ] [ Wing blowing ] Hey. I got them. I copied every single file on the b*st*rd. Thank you. [ Chuckles ] Stop. [ Sighs ] You know, after it happened, I just, um... It's taken me a while to start... feeling things again. It's the most natural thing in the world, right? Feeling things. I don't know why it's so hard. But it's something that I need to... learn all over again. I'm just too old. [ Chuckles ] You're not too old. [ Chuckles ] I'm not gonna see you again... am I? I don't have anything to give you. I wish that I did. I hope you get what you need. Thank you. [ Sighs ] [ Keys jingle ] I missed you. Nina. Mm, mm. Nina. What is it? What's... what's happening there today? Have you noticed anything? Arkady's sending many cables. There's lots of closed doors. Did you hear anything about an operation to grab somebody, maybe a scientist? Oleg and Arkady were fighting. Oleg is Line X, science and technology. I heard him say to another officer, um... "We let him go, we can take him back." I don't know what they're talking about. It could be about a scientist. But if Arkady doesn't want to take him, you don't take him. Oleg is impatient. He has a lot of important people in Moscow. Well, is Arkady running the Rezidentura, or isn't he? Oleg says Arkady thinks like a bureaucrat. He told me you can't beat the Americans thinking that way. [ Coughing ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Weakly ] Water. [ Coughs ] Water. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Coughing ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Bottle thuds ] [ Sighs ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Sighs ] Back home, we live on a kibbutz. My kids eat in the communal hall. My wife works in the fields with other wives. You like Communism? Come to Israel. It works much better there. [ Coughing ] [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] A very cold place, the Soviet Union. I like the cold. Ha. You miss it. You really miss it. [ Chuckles ] Unbelievable. [ Rhythmic knocking on door ] Did you get me a new safe house? You don't need one. [ Elevator bell dings ] Stan : Here's what I found out. This guy Oleg Burov... he runs Line X, the tech line at the Rezidentura. He's having a brouhaha with Arkady. You think they've got Baklanov? I think they're gonna try and exfiltrate him against his will. But this Oleg might just be cocky enough to lead us right where we want to go. [ Siren wailing ] [ Footsteps ] Your government made a deal. There's a car outside. [ Sighs ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Target headed north on Wisconsin. Two, pick up. Two approaching Wisconsin. [ Engine turns over ] Three going north on Fort Hunt. Two... north on Arlington. Stan : Picking up, Two. Man : Four cutting east to Leland. Three, pick him up on 43rd. Four, try Massachusetts. Anything alerting? Not really. [ Shouting in Hebrew ] What's going on? What's happening? Etai? Everything will be all right. He's on 295, heading north. I'll take him back at Colesville. Three, stay on surface roads. Four, where are you? Man : 1, heading north. Stay till Laurel, then 216. [ Sighs ] I'm a Jew. I can't help lingering on ironies. Here is a man you're sending home to Russia. Funny... I don't think he very much wants to go. And you... after you put him on the slow boat to hell... He'll be well-treated. ...you'll go home to your family. Is "home" the right word? Enough. Was that your wife I met earlier... the one who delighted in beating the crap out of me? What a nice bed you must have to sleep in at night. It's not too late for me to kill you. Where am I going? You said I would be safe. We spent the night together. We don't even know each other's name. But your name isn't your name, is it? Is your face your face? Are your children your children? Whoa, hey. Why? Why?! No, you can't do this! Oh, where are you taking me?! Help me! Quiet. Quiet. [ Handcuffs clicking ] You'll be home for Passover after all. No. Etai... Etai, you promised! You promised me! You gonna kill me? I have a right to know. We're not gonna kill you. [ Sighs ] You want me to work for you? Not for me. Oh, no, of course. Y-you're just obeying orders... [ Chuckles ] ...like Eichmann. You're gonna send me back to Russia? Is that it? Listen, I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll be of no use there. I'll, uh... [ Chuckles ] How can I work in a place I've spent my life trying to escape? Huh? My... my wife, my son... do you think I am going to work 5,000 miles away from my family? You're adaptable. You've proven that much. Let me work for you from here, huh? I have my lab, my resources. I'll give you things your government hasn't even dreamed of... ECM. You know what that means? Electronic countermeasures. Uh, radar, infrared, lasers... they can all be deceived. I can give this to you. I'll put you on the Arpanet. This you don't have in the Soviet Union. Please. Don't send me back there. Please don't send me back. Please. I don't want to go back! Please! [ Crying ] Please don't send me back! Please! [ Sobbing ] Got him... exited 295 on bypass road outside of Baltimore, headed north on Keith Avenue. Y-you have a family? My son's Bar Mitzvah is in three months. Give me that... three months. Let his father stand with him for his coming of age. [ Crying ] Please! They'll think I died! They'll never know! [ Sobbing ] At least look at me! [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] Oh, please! You're a monster! You're not a man! Whatever you once were, whoever you were, they trained it out of you! No feeling, no humanity! You may as well be dead! [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] Oh, please! Oh, please! [ Sobbing ] [ Door opens ] _ You okay? [ Sighs ] It's not all you. Why I'm reading the Bible, going to the youth group... it's not you. It's me. [ Sighs ] My life... my... crazy life... [ Sighs ] I don't know where to put everything. What do you mean? I... Uh, forget it. [ Sighs ] It's just... it's not your fault. That's all. Target entered Port of Baltimore. Two, take Dundalk. Four, Amports. Three, Fairfield. I've got Seagirt. [ Machinery whirring ] [ Machinery whirring ] Burov : Agent Beeman! You must know who I am, as well. Oleg Igorevich Burov. I noticed you on my tail an hour ago. Did you think I would lead you somewhere interesting? Where are your colleagues? I saw them, too. Where is Anton Baklanov? Who? Are you going to shoot me? I'm a diplomat, a guest in your country. Turn around. I'm here to talk about Nina Sergeevna. This is a unique opportunity for us. I've been hoping... we might find a good time. Here we are. Put the gun away. Nina's at such grave risk. What are you talking about? Please. No one else knows that you're running her. Not yet. I'm the only one. That's what matters. No, I didn't tell anybody at the Rezidentura what I've figured out. I'm a... a budding student of Capitalism. Everything has a value. Everything can be traded, yes? So... let's make a deal. What can  you  give  me...  in exchange for Nina's safety? We'll talk again. [ Clinking ] [ Footsteps ] Man :  Weinberger informed Congress that the Administration plans to ask for appropriations in the 1983 budget...  [ Volume increases ]  totaling nearly $260 billion. And in a development that seems to have taken American officials by surprise, the Soviet Union has granted the request of 1,500 Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. No official word yet on what led to the release of the so-called "Refuseniks," but a spokesman for the Israeli embassy called it "A welcomed development". [ Chuckles ] And some government leaders expressed hope that this might be a sign that the Soviet Union is changing its stance on human rights. [ Door opens ] [ Keys jingling ] [ Zipper opens ] Is he gone? Yeah. [ Sighs ] I spent the evening with your wife. Clark has some explaining to do. [ Sighs ] I'll let him know. [ Sighs ] [ Sighing ] Were there icicles in Smolensk in the winter? Yeah. What? Uh... [ Inhales deeply ] we used to have sword fights with them. [ Sighs ] When our train was pulling away from Moscow... there were icicles... on the trees. [ Sighs ] [ Sighing ] I remember. [ Alarm clock beeping ] [ Sighs ] [ Beeping stops ] They're up. Another day. [ Sighs ] Paige : Mom! What did you do with my green, striped top? [ Sighs ] Mom? Dad?
