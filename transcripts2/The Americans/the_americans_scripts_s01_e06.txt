 Male Announcer : Previously on The Americans... 
 Elizabeth : When we got here, I was 22 years old, It never really happened for us, but I feel like it's happening now. You're violating a shitload of Soviet laws, and you're looking at 10 years in a Siberian labor camp. You're gonna have to start working for me. [ Speaking Russian ] How did you get him to talk? I sucked his cock, just like you told me to. I never said that. I-I never said that. Nina, Jesus... Mr. Martin from the DOJ is on the line for you, Agent Gaad. Big day at FBI Counterintelligence? They were in the secure vault all day. Did you get a look inside this time? They don't let me in there. As soon as we got those encryption codes from you, the FBI changed them. Immediately? Within the day. Right when they were leaving for the meet, like they knew. You understand what that means? Somebody's talking. Somebody's talking. We have a mole. Man :  Leonard winds up to pitch. - How does this happen? High and outside. It's one of the things that happens when people are involved. And they're sure it's someone in the Rezidentura? It couldn't be a leak in Moscow? She seemed to know. Paige : Mom, you ready? I'll be right there. Next pitch on the way. I assume the FBI are running the mole, so I need to press Martha hard. A high fly ball to center. Henry's waiting in the car. Can we go, please? Yes. He got under that one. Still up there. Settles under it and makes the catch. And that is one down here in the third. [ Fanfare plays ] The O's kicked off the season Friday night with a 5-3 win against Kansas City. I just got out of a... an important meeting. Martha : Really? What about? I-- [ Sighs ] I can't really say. Top secret? Actually, I can't say because I didn't hear a word that was said. Why is that? I was thinking about you, to tell the truth. Oh? Look, even if we can't have anything more than a professional relationship, I would still like to see you sometime socially. I would like that. Well, I could be at your apartment in 20 minutes, if you want a cup of coffee or something. I would like that, but I have to work. [ Laughs ] It's Sunday. It's my new boss. He's showing me how important he is by wrecking my filing system. And my weekend. Well, you could be a half-hour late. I'll put a pot on. See you soon. Great. [ Gasps ] [ Grunting ] Come on! Get in there! [ Muffled screaming ] [ Tires screech ] [ Breathing heavily ] What-- what-- what am I doing here? Who-- who are you? [ Lighter clicks ] Who are you?! What... what do you want? You, Mr. Jennings. We want you. My name's not Jennings. Philip Jennings, 39. Wife-- Elizabeth. Children-- Paige and Henry. Runs Dupont Circle Travel. Seems to be out late at night quite a bit. Lives across the street from an FBI agent. Also, the details of his life before 1963 seem to be a bit... hazy. We know who you are and what you are, Mr. Jennings. You Commie prick. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] [ Horn honks ] [ Knock on door ] You wanted to see me, sir? I wanted your take on something. Sorry to call you in on a Sunday. Oh, that's okay. I was-- I was headed into town, anyway. [ Chuckles ] All those years undercover, Beeman-- I had you pegged for a better liar than that. How did you keep those white supremacists from making you? Well, I didn't work for them, sir. Entirely different dynamic. Take a look at this. Tell me what you think. What have we got? [ Sighs ] Adam Dorwin. Single gunshot wound. Nothing stolen, no criminal history. He was shot two miles from where we were surveilling the Rezident. Looks like... right around the same time. Should I get my "Carmac the Magnificent" turban? Are you gonna tell me the rest? The government has a secret defense program-- something about missiles. I-- I don't have more detail than that. But Dorwin was project manager for a company called Viseotech. They were working on the missile technology? About a month ago, some blueprints disappeared. That's all they told me-- "Top-secret blueprints, Defense Department, very unhappy." A Viseotech employee just happens to get shot at the exact same time that we're... tracking the KGB Rezident. That's a hell of a coincidence. [ Chuckles ] My mother always said coincidence was God's way of winking at you. That doesn't exactly feel like a friendly wink, does it? [ Groans ] [ Footsteps ] [ Floorboard creaks ] [ Door creaking ] [ Floorboard creaks ] [ Floorboard creaks ] [ Both grunting ] [ Clattering, glass breaks ] [ Thud ] Woman : Let's put these bags in the truck. [ Indistinct conversations ] What time is mom supposed to get here? About an hour ago. You have any change? For what? To call home, doofus. Yeah, but you owe me. [ Sighs ] [ Coin drops ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Telephones ringing ] [ Sighs ] Come on. Where are we going? Do you want to get home or not? Henry : Slow down! Mom's not gonna see us from here. Mom's not here. We're not supposed to hitch, Paige. We're not supposed to be left at the mall. [ Scoffs ] Are you scared? No. This is stupid. We should just go back and wait. You can wait. I'm going home. [ Sighs ] [ Footsteps ] [ Engine idling ] Stan : Hey. I'm done. You have to exfiltrate me. The Rezidentura is on the hunt for a mole. I've been of help to you. I have fulfilled my obligation. It's your turn now. Look, you're gonna have your chance to leave. I promise. You don't understand. I have to leave now. You need to stay calm. "Calm"? They're going to put a bullet in my head. I will not let that happen. You know what they do to people suspected of treason? They put them on a plane back to Russia, no discussions, no questions. They get them a trial and a lawyer, and they find them guilty. And I  am  guilty. You have to get me out now. You have to trust me, Nina... okay? Trust me. [ Philip grunting ] I want a list of every KGB agent you know of-- the ones you're running, other Directorate "S" illegals. [ Breathing heavily ] Too much to ask? How about we start with all dead-drop sites. KGB communication protocols. We both know where this is gonna go, Mr. Jennings. It's up to you how long we do this. There will be no spy trades under this president. [ Breathes heavily ] I'm not a spy. [ Book thuds ] [ Click ] Philip :  Big day at FBI Counterintelligence? Martha :  Yes, it was. Obviously, we know most of it, but I just want to hear the details from you because a crisis can provide an opportunity to uncover the leaks that we have been looking for in your office. So just tell me what you saw. Well... I-I know that a man was kidnapped. [ Click ] Lots of passports, multiple identities. There's been some interesting debate about your children. They were born here, so technically, they're American citizens. Can that be revoked? Can they be sent back to Russia? Oh, they don't speak Russian, do they? [ Taps passport ] Maybe they become wards of the United States government. [ Breathing heavily ] Go to hell. Bring her in! Let's go! [ Door opens ] Man : Go. Hey, where you headed? Falls Church Commons. Well, hop in. Well, listen, I-I don't have a whole lot of time, folks. I got to be to work in.. well, less than an hour. You know, it's not that far. We'll just walk. Thanks anyway. I mean, it's 10 miles. It's right on my way, but, okay, sure. Wait! Hey, wait! [ Tires screech ] It's 10 miles. Sorry. My brother's a little... Hey, not a problem. Thanks. Get in. I'm Nick. Paige. Thanks for stopping. We were stranded at the mall. Y'all hitchhike before? Yeah. Sure. [ Chuckles ] How old are you? 13. Hey, chief. That's Henry. Sorry he's so rude. He's chill. [ Grunts ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Telephone ringing ] It turns out our dead guy had access-- SCI clearance. And he was familiar with the genesis of the technology. You think he was leaking information to the Russians? Like I said, I believe in God but not coincidence. Did  we  take him out? Not as far as I know. My CIA sources say he wasn't even on their radar till his body turned up. What did your friend say about him? My friend has a big problem. Rezidentura knows there's a leak. These are dangerous operations. [ Sighs ] You know those Africans the criminal-investigation guys busted a few months ago with the diamonds in their asses? Ohh. I almost felt sorry for the CID guys on that one. Yeah, I'd like to request some of the jewels. I don't think your wife's gonna appreciate it if she ever finds out where they came from. [ Chuckles ] [ Elevator bell dings ] So, chief, you play any sports? I played football in high school, free safety. Loved to hit. Free safeties are usually the hardest hitter on "D." Henry. Oh, that's okay. Little man doesn't want to talk, he doesn't have to. Hey, cool with you guys if I make a quick stop? I thought you had somewhere to be. Ho-ho, little man  can  talk. Bread? For the ducks. I always feed them on my way to work. [ Water bubbling ] [ Gasping ] And? [ Coughs, gasping ] Get up. [ Grunting ] Come on. We have to get home kind of soon. It'll only take a minute. You don't want the ducks to starve, do you? Come on, chief. I'll introduce you to Donald. [ Ducks quacking ] That's nice. [ Sniffs ] [ Bottles clink ] [ Sighs, sniffs ] [ Inhales deeply ] [ Bottle opens ] Try it. It's Dutch. [ Groans ] You don't like it? No, it's-- it's good. [ Chuckles ] Hey. Make some new friends, chief. You know... [ Chuckles ] you're definitely gonna be a knockout in a couple of years. I'm not hitting on you or anything, but... you can expect to break some hearts. Thanks. You guys know how dangerous it is to hitchhike? I mean... you're lucky you ran into me and not some lunatic. [ Bird chirping ] Um... You know, I-- I think we can walk the rest of the way. Right, Henry? Yeah. Thanks for taking us this far. Come on. [ Bag thuds ] Hey! Somebody paid for that beer-- me. Not a lot of ducks, huh, chief? Must be a duck holiday. [ Sighs ] See, the thing is... I've done a lot of stupid stuff in my life. [ Chuckles ] Things someone should have talked me out of... before I messed up. Grab me another beer, will you, chief? [ Sniffs ] See, that's the thing. We all need somebody to keep us on the straight and narrow, someone who will call us on our sh1t... who ain't afraid to put the fear of God in us. You believe in God, chief? Yeah. Good. Because the society is lost if people lose faith. I mean, seriously... Without a higher power, we're no better than wild dogs. [ Grunts ] Aah! Run, Paige! Run! [ Groans ] Aah! 
 
 [ Discordant music plays ] [ Film projector clicking ] [ Sighs ] This is a camera. I need you to photograph documents at the Rezidentura. Doesn't matter which ones as long as they're highly classified. You said I could trust you. You said that you have it figured out-- that you would have a plan. This is the plan. It's suicide. If somebody catches me... Listen to me, Nina. I've been where you are. I've lived it. I know what it is to feel fear in every fiber of your being and not be able to show it. I've been there. Now, I can get you out. But... you have to stay with me. Okay? What if I'm caught? You won't be. You can do this, Nina. We can do this. Even if I can take the pictures... there's no way I can sneak them out. The security is very tight. You won't have to. [ Grunts ] There are no happy endings here. You can help her, you know? Talk now. Save her a lot of pain. [ Sighs ] Up to you. What do you think you're gonna get from us? Why don't you tell me? Fine, I will tell you. Nothing. You get nothing from us. She's trained for this. So am I. We'll die before we'll talk. We know how to do that. [ Groans ] Grannie : That's enough. [ Footsteps ] I'm sorry. We had to know if you were the mole, if we could... trust you. Untie him. If you could trust us? Yes. Very few of us knew about the FBI's encryption codes. You were the first two. And within a day, the FBI knew. What were we supposed to think? We should be the last people you suspect. This wasn't done lightly. You understand what's at stake. If there was the slightest possibility that you were betraying us, that would be a blow we would be unable to sustain. We  had  to know. Did you have permission for this? Did Zhukov approve this? This decision was made far above Zhukov's head. [ Groans ] [ Water splashes ] [ Screaming ] Philip : That's enough. That's enough! [ Gasps ] I'm gonna kill you, you stupid bitch! Tell whoever approved this that your face is a present from me to them! Show them your face! Show it to them! Where's my car? Where's my car?! [ Breathing heavily ] Sit down. Go. [ Groaning ] [ Panting ] [ Panting ] Okay. [ Sighs ] Grannie knew everything-- everything we knew about those encryption keys. What were they gonna do, string her up, too? I was this close to killing her. Are you okay? Yeah, you? Yeah. How could they do that to us? What did they do to you? Psychological pressure-- pictures of the kids. They didn't question you? No. They stopped? Yeah. You told them. What? What are you talking about? You told them I considered defecting. That's why this is happening. I didn't. What did you tell them? Nothing. You're lying. I can see it. What did you tell them? [ Sighs ] Philip. Philip... we are supposed to tell them things. That is part of this job. I... if I said  anything that made them think--  if I said anything that would... it would have been so long ago. What did you tell them? I told them that you liked it here too much. Philip. Philip. Don't touch me. Don't act like I made something up! They asked me, and I answered! You loved it here! You started loving it more and more! Now look what finally happened! I fit in!! I fit in, like I was supposed to! And, yes, I liked it. So what? I was supposed to be able to trust you, and I did. And I shouldn't have. I never should have. That's not true. [ Sighs ] [ Keys clatter ] You okay? [ Sighs ] What if he wasn't gonna do anything bad to us? He was a creep, Henry. What you did today... took courage. But I was scared. I know. [ Sighs ] What happened today... has to be our secret, okay? O-okay. [ Sighs ] What? What's wrong? I had an accident. [ Sighs ] All right. Come on. Let's go downstairs. I'll wash them for you. Okay. [ Typewriter clacking ] [ Indistinct conversation in distance ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Drawer closes ] [ Camera shutter clicking ] [ Door opens ] [ Indistinct conversation in distance ] [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Nina? [ Chuckles ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Sighs ] [ Buckle clicks ] [ Engine revving ] [ Sighs ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Piano music plays ] [ Sighs ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Sighs ] Thank you. $3.49. There's a sale on the Earl Grey. This is fine. [ Sniffs ] Now, that's good stuff. You want to use the water before it boils. I know how to brew tea. Thank you. [ Coins clink ] Oh. [ Sighs ] Sorry about that. [ Sighs ] Enjoy. [ Dialing ] [ Telephone rings ] It's done. [ Sighs ] [ Ringing ] Woman : Switchboard. Yeah, route me through the phone booth on Pennsylvania and 11th. [ Clears throat ] Cultural desk. How may I help you? Yes, could I speak to Vasili Nikolaevich? Uh, one moment. Uh, he's unavailable. May I take a message? Yes, tell him there's a tea shop in Piccadilly Circus that I know he'll enjoy when he's not under the gun. May I tell him who's calling? Tell him it's Theo. "Theo" who? He'll know. [ Sighs ] Guys? [ Rapid footsteps ] [ Sighs ] Oh, my God. What happened? - I was changing the station while we were driving, which is a stupid thing to do and-- We hit some ice, and it's okay. And we're okay. And everything is okay. [ Sighs ] Does it hurt? Uh... a little, yes. I'm-- I'm so sorry I wasn't there to pick you guys up. It's okay. How did you get home? Shelly's mom drove us home. Oh. Okay. Good. Good. Look, it has been a very, very long day, so what do you say we all get ready for bed? Okay. I'll beat you upstairs! No racing. [ Zipper closes ] I'm, uh, gonna go and see Martha. I never made it there this morning. Okay. I want to take her some jewelry. [ Sighs ] Make up for missing the date. Do you have anything? Do you have anything? [ Drawer opens ] [ Sighs ] [ Scoffs ] I'm sure she'll love it. [ Zipper closes ] [ Dialing ] [ Telephone rings ] Cultural desk. How may I help you? Is Vasili there? [ Grunting ] Not yet. Tell Vasili it's urgent. Sir, unless you tell me what this is about, I can't help. [ Receiver slams ] [ Dial tone ] [ Sighs ] [ Grunts, sighs ] [ Sighing ] [ Grunts ] When a lady calls, I oblige. That's what the lady counts on. [ Sighs ] What happened? Can I have one of those? I thought you stopped. Old habits are hard to break. [ Sighs ] So, where do you want my eyes? My children. And Philip. I'd rather keep them on you. On me, too, then. What's going on, Elizabeth? There's a mole. I need to know if I'm being watched. No one knows you exist. Someone knows. I'll be your eyes. [ Siren wails in distance ] Gregory. [ Door opens ] [ Keys jingle ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Sighs ] I got it. Beeman. Gaad : It's Gaad. I just got word-- the Rezident jumped ship without giving any notice to the State Department. You're sure it's him? I'm staring at a photo of him getting on a plane as we speak. He's on his way back to Russia right now. Just him? Just him. [ Sighs ] I appreciate the call. I thought you might. [ Receiver hangs up ] Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's good. [ Sighs ] Listen. [ Sighs ] I get that you can't... tell me things-- the secrets and stuff, but... [ Sighs ] I mean, there has to be something that you can share with me from work. I-I mean-- I don't know. Your boss gets on your nerves, or... um... you partner thinks he's funny, and he's not funny. I don't know. Something? You're right. Anything? [ Chuckles ] I don't know. You know, sometimes... sometimes what I do... gets scary. Not for me, you know? I don't have to worry about that anymore, but... but I have to worry about people. And today, it got pretty scary. But it worked out. [ Sighs ] It was a tough day. But it was a good day. That's good. I'm glad. Me, too. [ Sighs ] A car accident? Yeah. Oh, my God. I jumped a light. I thought you stood me up. [ Chuckles ] Are you kidding me? I think I was just excited to see you. [ Groans ] Ooh. Wh-- are you okay? Yeah. Did you see a doctor? Yeah-- well, a paramedic. He said I was fine. Clark, um... I know that we're not supposed to, but maybe they could assign someone different from your office to work with me. I can't. [ Sighs ] I just can't. And I'm-- I'm sorry, but... there's something I would like you to have so you understand how I feel. [ Sighs ] How did it go? She got over it. [ Sighs ] Philip. What do you want from me? It doesn't matter. You already did it. There's no undoing it. [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] You're not the only one who got hurt today, okay? I was ripped from my house. I was attacked by the people I believed in, the people I trusted most my whole life. Yeah, I think that says it all. [ Door slams ]
