 [ Knock on door ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Peter. Hey. 
 Mm. 
 It's late. Yeah. 
 That's not supposed to be one of Monet's lost frames? 
 No, just trying to clear my head. 
 Good. About that. 
 Vincent Adler... 
 Seven years ago, he ran a huge Ponzi scheme and disappeared with a billion dollars. 
 You knew him? 
 He's the man who made me who I am today. 
 Mm-hmm. He's rained hell down on both our lives. 
 You knew. You knew, and you didn't say anything? 
 I just figured it out myself, okay? 
 I'm trying to reconcile the Adler I knew with the man responsible for... 
 For Kate? For Mozzie? 
 Yeah. 
 So let's get him. 
 Come on. 
 Start talking. 
 Yeah, I'm not much of a beer drinker, so... I know. 
 That's why I brought you this. 
 Oh. I don't recognize the bottle. 
 That's because it cost as much as the beer. 
 Wow. I don't even need a corkscrew. 
 Nope. 
 Okay. 
 Now... 
 How do you know Adler? 
 It's a long story. 
 If we are gonna catch this guy, just like I caught you, I need to know everything. 
 There's too much to tell. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You're gonna plead the Fifth? 
 A few secrets are good, Peter... 
 Keeps the mystery alive. I get it. 
 This story includes some stuff about crimes I don't know about. 
 Yeah. 
 No. You're not holding back on me. 
 We've got all night. I'll make you a deal. 
 Full immunity for anything you say from this moment until the sun rises over that balcony. 
 Full immunity? 
 Did you kill anybody? 
 No. Then full immunity. 
 Hmm. 
 All right. Let's start with this. 
 Mozzie decoded the music box. 
 It's an equation. 
 This is what it built. 
 It's a fractal. 
 Very good. I've seen one like it before. 
 Where? - In Vincent Adler's office when I worked for him. 
 How did you meet him? 
 If you want to know about Adler, we got to start with Mozzie. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 It was eight years ago. 
 I was new to the city, didn't know the East Village from the West. 
 All right, follow the lady. 
 All you got to do is follow the lady. 
 I mix them fast, but if your eyes are faster, you win... 
 Simple as that. 
 Lady's in the middle. 
 You got good peepers, pal. Want to double up, buddy? 
 Sure. Toss them. 
 Okay. You think you can follow them, but I'm saying that you can't. 
 It's all a game of you vs. me. 
 All right, here we go, here we go. 
 Where is she? 
 Where is she? 
 Watch her. Watch her. 
 She's a sneaky lady, but I think she likes you. 
 She's on the right. 
 No, she's back in the middle. 
 Are you crazy? 
 She's definitely on the right. 
 Hey. It's his money, kid. 
 Crap. 
 Ah, she's sneaking around on you, boss. 
 Lucky guess. 
 You're so good at this, why don't you put your own money down? 
 You gonna bet or walk away. You! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 What you got? 
 All right. 
 $50? Come on, really take this guy. 
 Time to put up or shut up, kid. 
 It's up to you. 
 All right. 
 Let's go $500. 
 [ Crowd murmuring ] 
 Now we're talking. All right. 
 [ Laughter and applause ] 
 All right, looks like I hooked me a whale here. 
 Yeah. 
 Looky, looky, looky, hey, diddle, diddle, the queen's in the middle. 
 Follow her fast. Follow her slow. 
 My hands are fast. Your eyes are slow. 
 See her? Huh? See her? 
 Pick that little lady and you win, my man. 
 All you got to do is show me the smile on the lady's face, and you walk away with it all. 
 Ah! You sure? 
 Yeah. He's sure. 
 I'm sure. 
 [ Crowd murmuring ] 
 Fun game, man. 
 Thank you. You toss the broads really well. 
 [ Indistinct talking ] 
 Damn it! 
 Cado, you want to earn 10 bucks? 
 $20. 
 Seriously? 
 You gonna stiff me this time? 
 [ Sighs ] Go, you little weasel. Follow that guy. 
 He's in my training program. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 I'm the guy from the park. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Hey, I'm not here to give you hospital time, kid. 
 Good, 'cause I'm not giving you your money back. 
 Ah, keep it. 
 What's your angle? 
 Look, I been running find-the-lady for years, and even I didn't catch that swap. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Where's your partner? 
 I left him. Why? 
 I need an upgrade. 
 Mozzie had a goatee? 
 Well, only to distract from his toupee. 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, we talked. 
 Moz told me about his Detroit days. 
 He'd been running street cons since he was a kid. 
 Mm. Notice my lack of surprise. 
 What does any of this have to do with Adler? 
 Well, he's the reason Mozzie found me. 
 Mozzie : These forgeries are exquisite. 
 Who says it's a forgery? 
 Uh, given your living conditions,  I  do. 
 How did you match the tricolor seal? 
 Just eyeballed it. 
 By eye? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Huh. You are very talented, kid. 
 With you as my partner, we could move way beyond the street hustle. 
 What did you have in mind? 
 A long con, which, if executed properly, would enable us to purchase and retire on neighboring temperate-zone islands in a mere six months. 
 I just got to this city, and I'm too young to retire. 
 I'm talking about summiting the Everest of swindles. 
 Who's the mark? 
 Peter : Vincent Adler? 
 Yeah. Oh. 
 Now this is getting good. 
 [ Chuckles softly ] 
 It was the first time I heard Adler's name. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What? 
 Mm. 
 Those bonds... that's the first time I'd come across you. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Tell me. 
 You're stalling. 
 No, I'm not. Come on. 
 We got... we got a long time until sunrise. 
 We got plenty of beer and...this. So tell me. 
 Did you have to fight to take my case? 
 Yeah. It was a real tug-of-war. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Here's another one for you, Peter. 
 Stop hoarding all the new cases, Burke. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Bond forgery sent over from NYPD. 
 Two phony Atlantic incorporated bonds in six months. 
 What? You want it? 
 Two in half a year? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Atlantics have never been forged. 
 I'll pass. 
 All right. 
 Wow. This is quality work. 
 Mm, so is my kid's drawing on the fridge. 
 He's all yours. 
 Okay. 
 I think this guy has a future. 
 What was my nickname? 
 What? 
 Come on. Every case gets a nickname. 
 Hagen was the Dutchman before you I.D.'d him. 
 What was my nickname? 
 Oh, don't recall. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 Well, the sooner you remember, the sooner we can move on. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 James Bonds. 
 Bonds. 
 James Bonds. James Bonds. 
 Yes, yes. 
 Would you like another beer? 
 Yeah. 
 [ English accent ] 
 Shaken, not stirred? 
 Oh, see, I knew it was a mistake telling you. 
 Believe me, yours was just one file in a giant stack of cases. 
 [ Normal voice ] 
 Yeah. 
 But it was on top. 
 You weren't that good. 
 This guy's good. 
 Elizabeth : Honey, come on... Are we gonna put this away, or is that our new coffee table? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 What about this one is getting under your skin? 
 You really want to hear about this? 
 Well, of course, always. All right. 
 Satchmo! 
 He's tampering with federal evidence. 
 [ Chuckles ] Wow. That's a forgery? 
 The seal, the signature, the security strip. 
 See, most forgers are only experts at one aspect. 
 The man who forged this bond is capable of bigger things. 
 He can do it all. 
 Well, so can you. 
 Mm. Mm. 
 Mnh. 
 Lose the 'stache? 
 Yeah, sorry, Magnum. I still love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Satchmo... Elizabeth named him? 
 How do you know I didn't? 
 Well, Elizabeth likes old jazz. You don't. 
 Don't forget I knew a fair amount about you before it was over. 
 Hmm. Know thine enemy. 
 Know thyself, and you will win a hundred battles. 
 Mozzie's influence? 
 Big student of history. Uh-huh. 
 Tell me how you went after Adler. 
 He was a big fish. 
 There he is, our white whale. 
 What did you find out about him? 
 Well, he's the C.E.O. of Adler Financial Management, and he runs their top hedge fund. 
 Good. What'd he bring in? 
 I don't know. 
 Never say that. Know everything. 
 Adler made $150 million last year, up 8% from the prior year. 
 Know thine enemy, and you will win... Sun Tzu. 
 All right. What's the con? 
 Well, Adler routes a hefty percentage of his profits into an account in the Caymans every six months. 
 Tax-free? 
 Exactly. 
 All we need to reroute his next wire transfer is two pieces of information... 
 Account number and password. 
 That's where you come in. 
 Where does he keep it... 
 Personal safe, deposit box? 
 In his head. He's too smart to keep it anywhere else. 
 I can't just walk up and ask him for it. That's impossible. 
 A wise man once said it's fun to do the impossible. 
 Bertrand Russell? 
 Walt Disney. 
 You should read more. 
 Our clock is five months. 
 You'll ingratiate yourself, become a trusted friend, then convince him to tell you. 
 Why don't you do it? 
 I'm more the behind-the-scenes guy. 
 All right, look at me, and then look in the mirror. 
 Who has a better chance of charming Adler at the charity dinner on Friday? 
 The antiquities recovery project? 
 It's five grand a plate. I can't afford that. 
 Well, you can if you cash in a few more of your bonds. 
 Peter : Big mistake. 
 Cashing those bonds was a calculated risk. 
 But it was worth it for the con we were about to run on Adler. 
 Yeah, but bankrolling them got us our first visual on you. 
 If I recall, I wasn't the only one who made a mistake that day. 
 No, hang on, hang on. Yeah. 
 Yeah, it was that bank in Midtown. 
 Hey. 
 Did you get it? 
 Yep. 
 The teller was a sweetheart. 
 Oh, she gave you a sucker. 
 You know, the irony of that would not be lost on Alanis Morissette. 
 Peter : This guy's a forger. He's good. 
 What? 
 Shh. Brooks Brothers suit. 
 Yes, I understand. So? 
 So that means fed... Talking to the bank manager. 
 We got to go. 
 ...These bonds, I want you to call me immediately. 
 Never met a fed before. 
 Let's keep it that way. 
 Detain him if possible. 
 Absolutely. Good. 
 Excuse me. 
 Sorry, I-I couldn't help but overhear. Are you with the FBI? 
 Special agent Peter Burke. 
 Wow. 
 I-I just took some money out of the bank, and I heard you talking about counterfeiting. 
 Your money's safe. I'm looking after counterfeit bonds. 
 Well, I have some bonds at home. 
 How would I know if they're not real? 
 I'm sure they're fine. 
 Well, thanks again for all the hard work you're doing, agent Burke. 
 That's for you. Have a good day. 
 He's not a nanny goat in a petting zoo. 
 He's a fed. 
 Within minutes, he could have set up a five-block perimeter... 
 Hundreds of trench-coated G-men. 
 It was worth it. We now know two things. 
 We got to move off bonds, and his name is Peter Burke. 
 Know thy enemy, right? 
 Fine. 
 Now you've got the money to pay for the invitation. 
 What name you gonna use? 
 I don't know. 
 Halden. 
 Nicholas Halden. 
 Quaint. 
 Get yourself a few aliases. You're gonna need them. 
 Oh, pop quiz, hot shot... 
 Adler's market strategy pre-crash? 
 Short derivatives, bullish on commodities. 
 Mm. You have learned much, grasshopper. 
 Why are you filling that bottle with bargain red? 
 Have you studied Adler's wine list? 
 Is that the '91 Bordeaux? 
 The one year it was corked in the wrong bottle. 
 $800 a pop. 
 [ Whistles ] 
 I, of course, got this bottle empty. 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 Best served when the guests are drunk. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 And I asked my cleaner to keep an eye out for something in your size. 
 Yeah, I don't know if I'm a suit guy. 
 Ah, you'll be fine. 
 Adler : Well, I really appreciate you coming. Thanks. 
 Mr. Adler? 
 Nick Halden. Nice to meet you. 
 I brought this from my collection. 
 That's very generous. Thanks for coming. 
 Hey, nice play on the emerging markets last quarter. 
 You really called Russia. 
 Well, it all came down to grains, didn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 Where do you think they're going? 
 Bull market. 
 For us, not Europe. 
 I'd say their imports are up 20%. 
 Interesting. Enjoy the party. 
 Raphael's  Saint George and the Dragon... 
 It's a powerful piece. 
 Commodities  and  art? 
 You've got diverse interests. 
 Like you, art is my passion. 
 Then you should talk to my assistant. 
 Nick Halden. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Kate Moreau. 
 Hi. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You like it? 
 What? What? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 No, it's, uh... 
 It's breathtaking. 
 It's my favorite one. 
 Raphael was a master of balance... thick brush strokes for the landscape, but the skin tones are almost...translucent. 
 Are you an artist? 
 I dabble. 
 I tried, but the romance of being a starving artist wore off very fast. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Well, you won't find any original Nick Haldens at a gallery downtown. 
 What do you do? 
 I'm looking for new opportunities. 
 Excuse me, sir. May I take that? 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 You're here to cozy up to my boss. 
 If I work for Adler, I can go anywhere. 
 Any advice? 
 I've seen the seating chart, and you're nowhere near him. 
 That's your first challenge. 
 Hi. 
 I like a challenge. 
 Good luck, Nick. 
 Thanks. 
 It seems my date has been relegated to the Buenos Aires table. 
 You have until the salad course arrives to tell me what you want. 
 Go. 
 I want to work for you. 
 In what capacity, other than your enthusiasm for grains and paint? 
 Acquisitions. 
 My team is full. 
 Cameron Singer... You're about to buy his firm. 
 Speculation's been front page of the  Journal  all week. 
 Pass the bread. 
 Well, he's been avoiding that woman. 
 Hannah Fields? 
 Next week, Hannah Fields will announce her new investment branch. 
 She's buying out Singer. 
 He's gonna back out of your deal, and the media will eat it up. 
 Your company will appear unstable. 
 That could spook investors. 
 I'm gonna continue my meal now with someone who looks better in an cocktail dress than you. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Well, look into Singer. 
 If it turns out I'm right, call me. 
 The Singer deal... was it true? 
 Absolutely. Mozzie and I had been spying on them for weeks. 
 Adler ditched Singer and brought me in a month later. 
 He hired you to find things for him to buy. 
 Well, part of my job was knowing everything about everyone Adler dealt with. 
 He had a lot of holdings and a lot of enemies. 
 Turns out I had a knack for rooting them out. 
 And Kate was there the whole time. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Is that when you guys got together? 
 No, no. She had a boyfriend. 
 Neal : Hmm. Oh. 
 It's not there. 
 All right, we'll just have to try again. 
 Remind me again why I let you make my favorite necklace disappear. 
 Because...You like magic. 
 [ Both chuckle ] 
 Someday you're going to tell me all of your secrets. 
 I mean it. 
 May I? 
 Maybe someday. 
 Come out with me on Friday. 
 I, um... I have your assignment from Adler. 
 He wants you to look into this. 
 Right. 
 Looks like someone's been looking into his recent art acquisitions. 
 Nick? 
 Michael asked me to move to Chicago with him. 
 Chicago? 
 Are you gonna go? 
 Um, I-I am, in a month. 
 It's a big step. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 Well, you'll like Chicago. 
 They, uh... They have a great art museum, and decent pizza. 
 Little windy. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Yeah, I've heard that. 
 I should just get this... I need to get back to work. 
 What is this? 
 It's a fractal... a mathematical curiosity. 
 Peter : That was the first time you'd seen one? 
 Yeah. You know, he was obsessed with them. 
 His were similar to that one, but none was an exact match. 
 Okay, so, Kate was going to Chicago with another guy, and you were trying to root out whoever was looking into Adler's stuff. 
 Keep talking. 
 You found the culprit. 
 She talked her way in. 
 She seems mostly interested in your South American acquisitions. 
 And you got her to come here in person? 
 I had the foundation feed her a story that they were impressed with her research. 
 She thinks she's here for a job interview. 
 Bring her in. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Miss Hunter. 
 Alex Hunter. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. Have a seat. 
 Miss Hunter... 
 Your passion for antiquities is unusual for such a young woman. 
 Well, every object has a story to tell. 
 I find those stories fascinating. 
 That was almost convincing. 
 Who are you working for? 
 I don't work for anyone...yet. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 You can drop the act. 
 Someone is paying you to get into my records. 
 Now, who is that? 
 Why don't you tell me? 
 Sir, maybe it would be best if we... What are you looking for? 
 There were rumors you made some big discoveries. 
 I got curious. 
 I thought you wanted to share your art with the world. 
 That's for me to decide. 
 You accessed my private database. 
 You made copies of my records. 
 I should bring charges. 
 Everybody gets one big mistake in life and one opportunity to fix it. 
 I believe in second chances, miss Hunter. 
 I think you're clever enough to know what I mean. 
 Thanks, Nick. 
 Grateful to be here, Mr. Adler. 
 Vincent. 
 Your hard work deserves a reward. 
 Thank you. 
 I know I don't meet the buy-in, but... 
 Nick, come on, now. We've talked about this. 
 You know I don't like my people to invest in the fund. 
 You've made exceptions. 
 For you. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Peter : You invested your money with him. 
 Mm. All of it. 
 We all did. He was making us 14%. 
 You didn't know it was a scam? 
 No. 
 My goal at the time was to prove my loyalty to Adler. 
 The job became my life. 
 Then what happened to Alex? 
 I know there's more to that story. 
 [ Kate laughing ] 
 You're sweet. 
 Nice trick. 
 You got me. 
 You got off easy. 
 Too late to apologize. 
 I'm not gonna apologize. It's my job to catch you. 
 It's your job to not get caught. 
 Fair enough. 
 What do you want? 
 Buy me a drink, and we'll talk. 
 Let's go. 
 
 
 
 [ Both sigh ] 
 Nick Halden... That's a good name. 
 Not your real one, but I like it. 
 I recognize a fellow grifter when I see one, Nick. 
 All right. 
 Humor me, Alex. 
 What were you really looking for? 
 Something Adler doesn't have. 
 He has everything. 
 He doesn't have this. 
 It's a music box. 
 Quite the Holy Grail. 
 It's worth about as much. 
 So Alex turned you on to the music box. 
 Yeah, she'd been chasing it for years. 
 She heard Adler had information on it. 
 Did he? 
 He had a rumor that it was at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen. 
 Said she'd send me a message if she ever needed my help getting it. 
 What kind of message? 
 A flower. 
 Did she ever send it? 
 Yeah, but that's another part of the story. 
 Alex disappeared, and Kate... 
 Well, things changed. 
 Mozzie : You're taking a sick day? 
 I'm not allowed to feel lousy? 
 Every day with Adler counts. 
 I've already got the siphon in place. 
 All we need is the password. 
 I'll get the password. 
 You know, I'm sensing your heart isn't totally into this. 
 My heart is fine. 
 Ah. This is about the girl. 
 I thought she left for Chicago. 
 She left today. 
 You know, it's probably for the best. 
 Now you can focus. 
 [ Knocking on door ] 
 I got to go, okay? 
 [ Cellphone beeps ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Kate? 
 You're supposed to be in Chicago. 
 It's a big step... 
 In the wrong direction. 
 Why? 
 Because you're here. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You and Adler developed a connection and you and Kate were finally together. 
 You had it all. 
 Yeah, I was eating the best food, wearing the best suits, drinking the best wine... the kind that has corks. 
 It was the perfect life. 
 And it was also the perfect lie. 
 You and Mozzie were still working the long con. 
 Trying to make the lie real. 
 But every con has an expiration date. 
 Adler makes the transfer on Friday, and you still haven't gotten the password yet. 
 I said I'll get it, I'll get it. 
 Oh, good, because I thought you were having second thoughts about abandoning your new town-and-country lifestyle. 
 Don't kid yourself. 
 Kate doesn't even know your real name. None of them do. 
 They care about me, okay? 
 She cares about me. 
 Um, no. 
 She cares about Nick Halden, and he doesn't exist. 
 I hear the suit's been asking around about you. 
 He has a sketch. 
 Where'd he get a sketch? 
 Oh, they always have a sketch or a print or something. 
 Look, it's time to finish this job and move on. 
 Let's have a look at you. 
 Never worn a custom suit before. 
 The fit is perfect... 
 Except for the cuff. 
 The break should be an eighth of an inch above the shoe. 
 Nelson. 
 Good eye, sir. 
 I can't accept. This is a $10,000 suit. 
 You can and you will. 
 Some people say dress for the job you want. 
 I say dress as the man you want to be. 
 Nick, men like you and I... We have an obligation to assault the commonplace every chance we get, from the clothes we wear to the art we collect to the women in our lives. 
 You and Kate have gotten close. 
 Yeah. 
 You look good together. 
 How does she feel about it? 
 There are things about me that I haven't told her. 
 I wouldn't worry. 
 Oftentimes, the things we try and hide are the most obvious to the people around us. 
 Everything all right? 
 Nelson, would you excuse us for a moment? 
 Of course. [ Clears throat ] 
 Thanks. 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 There's something you should know. 
 What's wrong? 
 I flagged a small irregularity in your account in the Caymans. 
 Trace-analysis reports were inconclusive. 
 What kind of irregularity? 
 Blips from a random I.P. address. 
 Hacker? 
 It's probably someone from the bank, confirming. 
 But I'd have to look into the account details to be sure. 
 You'd need the password. 
 I'll arrange a time for us to go to the bank so you can access it yourself. 
 No, no. 
 I trust you. 
 Bank closes at 6:00. Burn this when you're done. 
 Don't sell yourself short. 
 Kate'll love you for who you really are... 
 As will others. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You like the hat? 
 I could get used to it. 
 Are you all dressed up with somewhere else to go? 
 No, I just have to be somewhere by 6:00. 
 It's a commitment I made a long time ago. 
 I think that you should blow off said commitment. 
 Yeah? 
 Look. Our violinist agrees. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You are staying here with me. 
 I promised a friend. I can't... I can't back out of it. 
 Kate, I'm... 
 What's wrong, Nick? 
 I just feel like... you and me and all this... I don't know. 
 I feel like I could blink, and it'd all be gone. 
 You just blinked. 
 I'm still here. 
 Then nothing else matters. 
 You didn't get the password. 
 You said it yourself. This is a long con. 
 You stepped on the brakes when you should have leaned in. 
 It's Kate, isn't it? 
 I'm in love with her. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Every con man gets his heart broken  once. 
 She's not gonna break my heart. 
 Well... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 ...We'll get them next time. 
 Love is a temporary madness. 
 It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides. 
 St. Augustine. 
 Good. You've been reading. 
 A smart guy told me to. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Both sigh ] 
 Oh, my God. 
 I want more. 
 What? 
 You're insatiable. 
 Pizza. 
 What? 
 We have half a marguerita left over from last night. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Ah. 
 Wait, hold on. Whoa... Who said you get the sheet? 
 No, no, no, no, no. Yes, I get it. 
 All right. 
 Mine. All right. 
 Oh. 
 Whew. Wow. 
 Nick. What? 
 The neighbors can see you. 
 Oh. Hi, neighbors. 
 Should I give them a little show? 
 No. Here. 
 Look. There. Ooh, I got a hat, too. 
 Now you're presentable. 
 All right. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You like that? 
 [ Laughs ] Put some pants on. 
 [ Television clicks on ] 
 Reporter :  ...Floors of Wall Street. You got the sheet. 
 You don't get the last slice. 
 It's only fair. 
 Vincent Adler has disappeared, and with him hundreds of millions of dollars of his clients' money. 
 A preliminary investigation indicates his investment firm may have been built on a giant house of cards. 
 Securities regulators now claim Adler never traded any shares for client accounts. 
 If true, Adler's disappearance could prove to be the brilliant exit strategy for one of the greatest financial frauds of our time. Holy cow. Can you believe it? Who'd have figured? Nobody saw this coming? Huh. This guy took thousands of people for their life savings, including charities. Clinton Jones. Word around here is that you're putting together a special white-collar task force. I am. Well, I've only been here a few months. But I was wondering, if there were some spots open, if I could get a shot. Are you the one who put the Dutchman on our radar? Yes, sir. I studied a profile like his at Quantico. Hmm. Well, I can't promise anything. It is a long list, agents with more seniority... You know how it is. That's not the same sucker you got from James Bonds last year, is it? People talk. Yeah. Well, nobody gets why I'm still holding on to this. Unfinished business. I get it. So, Adler disappeared, but what about his account? There was only a dollar left in it. The password was an anagram for "nice try Neal." Then what happened with Kate? No money, no jobs. It's all gone. I know. I know. Hey, hey. We're gonna be okay. It's just you and me now, right? That's all that matters. Come here. We're gonna get it all back, okay? Okay. How? Okay, if we're gonna do this, I need to tell you something about me. What? I'm not Nick Halden. My name's Neal Caffrey. You and Kate lost everything. Yeah. Adler paid well. We put it right back into the company. And why not? Everything he touched turned to gold. He conned us. He conned everybody... And then disappeared. What happened after you told Kate the truth? I thought this was about Adler. Well, I just got a few beers left, and I'm curious. I taught her to survive. Hey, you, stop! Someone stop that guy! [ Siren wails ] Freeze! Put your hands up! Hey. Get up. Officer, this man stole my package. I did no such thing. Whoa, whoa, be careful with that. It's the Falconer manuscript from the 16th century. Hey, I recognize this guy. Oh. How you doing, Smedley? This guy's got warrants out in three different states. Thanks to you, we can get him off the streets. Write him a receipt. You can't take that. It's worth a fortune. We'll look after you, okay? Bring this to the 23rd Precinct. Pick it up from evidence in a few days. Days?! 23rd. [ Scoffs ] I'm a little sick of being scalped every time we pull one of these. You know, Moz, you look better without the hairpiece. Very handsome. Hale takes a cut. We split the rest three ways. I don't know. It's not bad. [ Sighs ] To all this. To the best of times. And to... Our villa on the Côte d'Azur, the sun setting over the Mediterranean. The olive trees whispering in the hills. Let's do it. Let's go. Now? You want to go to France now? Yeah. Look, that FBI agent... Burke. He's been asking around about the British pounds. Maybe... I don't know. Maybe we should take some time away, outside the FBI's range. We can start in Cap d'Antibes while it's still warm, work our way up to Paris, over to Amsterdam, then Copenhagen. I'm not going to Copenhagen. Okay, I should've mentioned Alex. This isn't about Alex, Neal. You can't just say, "Hey, Kate, let's go to Copenhagen for this opportunity Alex told me about." You just tried to con me. I made a mistake, okay? I'm doing this for us. That music box is worth a fortune. It can give us the life we want. You went to Copenhagen without her. Yeah. The box was there. But it was a three-person job. Without Kate, it fell apart. Alex ended up in a French hospital, and I barely escaped. But someone at the palace pointed the finger at you. Everyone thought you had the box. I didn't correct them. Sure. It gave you great street cred. I came back to New York. Kate was gone. Well, she learned something from me, 'cause she disappeared. I started running big cons. Guess I was trying to get her attention. [ Chuckles ] Well, you certainly got ours, Steve Tabernackle. You knew about Steve? We knew a lot of things. Before returning to New York, Caffrey popped up in Denmark and France. He's not afraid to cross borders. He definitely does his homework. We flagged his aliases at all ports of entry. I mean, when we get a hit, we throw up roadblocks. No, he'll never use the same I.D. twice. Tell me something I haven't heard. What about you? Agent... Berrigan. You're on the run. How do I catch you? Stake out my girlfriend? Well, Caffrey has one, right? We think they split up. Well, but we know where she is. Does she know we're onto her? No. We've never had enough on her to bring her in. And he hasn't gone anywhere near her. Hang on. It took us months to catch her, and she never stays in the same place for more than a week. She's hiding from him. He doesn't know where she is. [ Knock on door ] Neal : Hey, Ruby's in Burma. I'm gonna need a bush plane to get... Oh, no. Did your pigeon die? No, Estelle's fine... best homer in the city. Then what? I received some news. Some...information has surfaced on the street. Kate? Y-you have to understand. It comes from a highly unreliable source. Where is she? His name is Jimmy the Snitch. I need a location. [ Sighs ] Neal, this smells like a trap. I don't care. I need to see her. [ Sighs ] It's a storage facility. She'll be there this afternoon. All right. Thanks. Neal. Be careful. Forging Raphael. You've gotten good. I heard the real painting was stolen. I hoped it would get your attention. It did. I missed you. I lied to you about a lot of things, Kate, but I never lied about loving you. I believe you. I love you, too. [ Both chuckle ] How did you find me? Well, Moz heard you were fencing Mauritian penny stamps. I quit dealing in stamps. It's okay. FBI! Hands on your head! Agent Burke. Neal Caffrey. You're under arrest. I know. [ Guns cock ] Thank you. I never would have found her without you. It's my pleasure. So you guys were all in that municipal van out front? That's got to be uncomfortable. Doesn't smell too good, either. Neal : And you know the rest. [ Sighs ] All right, so what do we do next? We find Adler. He's the key to this whole damn thing. Well, I've looked. His trail didn't go cold, Peter. There  is  no trail. I caught you when I found out what you wanted most. We know what he wants most. The fractal. Yeah. What is this? You have any ideas? It must mean something, must point somewhere. Are you telling me the truth, Neal? Why do you ask? I only know one of your friends who's into origami. Alex has been here. And this receipt is from today. What does she think it is? It's a fractal antenna. They're in everything now. There's one in your cellphone. And this shape corresponds to a specific frequency for an emergency beacon. Emergency beacon? Mm-hmm. You're telling me that if we build a real one of these and we hook that up to a radio... It's gonna lead us to a boat or a plane or something that disappeared in the 1940s. Something worth killing two people, something worth all this? It's worth it to Adler. Then I guess we have to find it first.
