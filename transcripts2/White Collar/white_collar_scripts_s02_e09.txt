 Who is that? 
 Peter : Agent Garrett Fowler. 
 I gave you the box, Kate, and I never hear from you again. 
 Alex! 
 Here. I don't need all the heat this is gonna bring. 
 Moz : I deciphered the phone number that Kate dialed from the plane. 
 I traced it to a store-bought burner phone. 
 So no names associated with it. Not yet. 
 Whatever this thing's hiding, it's not the music. 
 Peter : I think it's a keyhole. 
 A key to  what? 
 That's the last piece of the music box. 
 I'm giving up my obsession. 
 Are you suggesting I give up mine? 
 Diana : Marshals monitor the anklet. 
 [ beep ] 
 Yes, one of these keys goes to your anklet. 
 I know who Kate called from the plane. 
 It was the FBI agent who set up the deal between you and Kate. 
 Garrett Fowler. 
 Now I need to find him. 
 Is this a good idea? 
 You have a better one? 
 No. 
 You think Mozzie can do this? 
 Oh, he is a savant when it comes to things like this. 
 Rain man. I get it. 
 You should see him with a Rubik's cube. 
 Probably can do it with his feet, right? 
 30 seconds, socks on or off. 
 Ohh. This is the single greatest day of his life. Yep. 
 All the conspiracy theories have come true. 
 We've been so close, and now we finally meet. 
 I told you. I agreed with you. 
 Shush! 
 No, there's no shushing. 
 No shushing for you. 
 You ready to record this? 
 Yes, but... 
 First walk me through it. 
 All right. Pay attention. 
 This is where it gets good. 
 We noticed this broken piece... 
 Wasn't broken. 
 It's a keyhole. 
 Yep. 
 And  this  is the key. 
 [ Click ] 
 [ Clicking ] 
 There's a second comb. 
 Yep. We snap it into place. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. 
 [ Mozart's Piano Sonata #2 in "F" plays ] 
 Any idea what kind of code it is? 
 [ click, music stops ] 
 Sounds could correspond to numbers, wavelengths. 
 Pala's discovery of hidden music in "The Last Supper." 
 Runescape's encoded flute solo! 
 Don't forget "Close Encounters." 
 Geographical coordinates encoded... 
 Both : ...In five tones. 
 Very good, suit. 
 Clearly we're in good hands. 
 Yeah. 
 [ loud click ] 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm getting this out of harm's way. 
 And  I  am keeping this. 
 That's a good idea. 
 If we defang the box, we can use it to lure out Fowler. 
 No way. 
 Tomorrow, you and me. 
 It's back to business as usual. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. Business as usual. 
 Us without the box. 
 Down. 
 How old is this code? 
 Hard to say. 
 The last credible report has the box disappearing from Konigsberg Castle in '45. 
 Now, assuming no one has reunited the cherub and the box since then... 
 Wait, wait. 
 The box and the key were together the day we stole it. 
 Alex. 
 She had them both before she brought the box back to me. 
 Well, she obviously inserted the key and found the comb. 
 So why'd she give it back? 
 Couldn't solve it herself? 
 Or she took something out of it. 
 Or she knows something we don't. 
 She could be a step ahead of us. 
 Yeah. 
 We really should talk to her. 
 It's too bad she disappeared to Italy. 
 Mm, maybe. 
 Hey. You know where Alex is, don't you? 
 I have an idea. 
 How did Mozzie do? 
 Better than I expected. 
 [ sighs ] 
 I'm convinced. He's the cherub for the job. 
 [ chuckles ] 
 And what about Neal? 
 How's he doing with all this? 
 I don't know if he's interested in the music box. 
 I think he just wants to find Fowler. 
 See what he knows about Kate's death. 
 Well, speaking of Fowler, we got a blip on the radar. 
 An old bank account. 
 Someone checked the balance. 
 Can you trace it? 
 No. It was done remotely. 
 200 bucks in the account? 
 Yeah, he emptied his accounts when he went underground, but he didn't get much. 
 Maybe he's desperate for cash. 
 What are you thinking? 
 Do you know about his wife's death? 
 She was killed during a robbery a few years ago. 
 Back when he was working violent crimes for the bureau. 
 Suspicious circumstances surrounded her murder. 
 That kept the insurance company from finalizing their claim. 
 We could make it look like the claim finally came through. 
 Put a stack of cash in the account. 
 If he bites, we can track the withdrawal. 
 In the meantime, make sure that stays safe. 
 Mm. 
 What bushes did you rustle to uncover Alex's trail? 
 Remember that silver collection she fenced a few years ago? 
 The Spanish pieces from the  Almiranta  shipwreck? 
 They're popping up again, one at a time. Ugh. 
 Hale. 
 I don't like loitering. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Neal! 
 I really appreciate this. 
 So, what happened to your goatee? 
 You know I liked it. 
 We all grow up. 
 All children... 
 Except one. 
 Did you bring it? 
 It's from the  Almiranta. 
 Who's the fence? 
 Anonymous. 
 The thief? 
 It's the third piece of shipwreck silver I've had come through this month. 
 Someone's been busy. 
 Too  busy. 
 I like that "someone." 
 So you should warn her the NYPD is on the trail. 
 If they make the  Almiranta  connection... 
 Understood. 
 What do I owe you for this? 
 We all go way back. 
 Just remember me fondly when you pull the next job. 
 Well, that might be a while. 
 Or it might  not. 
 He thinks it's Alex... 
 She knows how valuable this stuff is, and she knows  where  it is. 
 She's stealing back her own stuff. 
 When the NYPD realizes it's all from the same collection... 
 They'll set a trap. 
 Unless we get to her first. 
 Oh, that would take FBI resources we don't have access to. 
 I can get those. 
 How? 
 I con the FBI. 
 Following standard Peter protocol, that means he'll try to pull from the reserve of active case files, which I am allowed to take home and peruse. 
 Exhibits "a," I presume? 
 Yes. 
 They range from mortgage fraud to copyright infringement back to mortgage fraud. 
 Sorry, I just dozed off. I know. 
 But Peter always tries to find a diamond in the rough. 
 So you want to create a diamond for him to find. 
 Exactly. 
 If we can forge a case file linking the silver thefts, he won't be able to resist it. 
 And then he'll think he found the case himself. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 It's brilliant! 
 Hello, hello. 
 Neal : June. 
 Sorry to interrupt your project, but I will be leaving town for a few days, so, as per our agreement... 
 Oh, you want me to walk Bugsy. 
 Please. He loves your company. 
 You got it. 
 [ chuckling ] Okay. 
 Thank you. Bye-bye, you two. 
 Uh, so she has you dog whispering? 
 Small price to pay. Where were we? 
 Hale told us when the silver pieces started coming in, we know Alex's M.O.,  and  I created this. 
 You named Alex "the silver burglar"? 
 All right, I admit it lacks a certain flair. 
 But it makes the point. 
 It includes the police reports for the stolen items, and I've added just enough FBI research to connect the dots. 
 Uh, your file's a tad too nice to have been floating around the bureau. 
 So we age it. Just like a painting. 
 Get in the mind of the file. 
 Live the life of the file. 
 Hear the pulse of the file! 
 Can we do this? 
 Please. 
 Step one... the case file is assembled by our clerk, Janice. 
 She merges all the various reports... 
 Oh. Probably over lunch. 
 She logs in the police reports and staples them together. 
 Oh. Looks like she forgot a page. 
 Nice. 
 Now, our probee usually brings her coffee. 
 It's an excuse to flirt. 
 Oh, he's left-handed. 
 Then it goes to Susan, who highlights the pertinents. 
 Oh, she's the eau de parfum? 
 She is. 
 [ Sprays ] 
 [ Sprays ] 
 [ Humming "Batman" tv show theme ] 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh. This is the first burglary victim. 
 Susan sees the name and then starts humming. 
 Mr. Gordon? 
 He was a county commissioner. 
 Commissioner Gordon. 
 ♪ Batman ♪ 
 No one will know what song you hummed when we did this. 
 Live  the file. 
 Next. 
 Then it gets approved by Hughes. 
 Now, his signature is tricky. 
 He has his assistant sign for him... 
 So... 
 Oh. Forging the forger. 
 Nicely done. 
 Now it gets passed around the office a few times. 
 Nice one. 
 Now I slip it in with the rest of the files. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Oh. Hey, honey. 
 Hey, hon. 
 Hey, buddy. How you doing? Good. 
 He's in trouble. 
 Uh-oh. Mm-hmm. 
 Ooh, Chinese. 
 Yeah. Satchmo got into the quiche I made. 
 Uh-oh. 
 [ smooches ] 
 Bad dog. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, so the reserve box, huh? 
 Looking for your next case? 
 Yeah, it's time for Neal and me to get back to basics. 
 [ Sighs ] Want to help? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 [ chuckles ] 
 All right, what do we got? 
 Antitrust lawsuit. 
 Yeah. Does that sound interesting? 
 No, actually, boring. 
 Mm. 
 All right. Let's see... 
 Medicare scam. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Okay, well, you sighed, so we're gonna pass on  that  one. 
 Oh, look at  this  one. 
 Cat burglar. That's kind of sexy. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Someone  smells good. 
 That would be Susan. Let me see that. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Look good? 
 This should do the trick. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, I know  that  look. 
 You got your eye on a new bad guy. 
 Ah, got our next case. 
 What do you know about stolen Spanish silver? 
 Do you even have to ask? 
 Oh, just once I wish I did. 
 A silver thief. 
 I've heard good things. 
 Thought you might like this. 
 Cat burglary. Love it. 
 [ Humming "Batman" tv show theme ] 
 Why are you humming? 
 Something in the file. 
 Popped into my head. 
 Peter : All right, settle down, kids. 
 NYPD has been investigating a series of silver heists. 
 The thief breaks through the window and then cleans out the place. 
 But here's what NYPD missed. 
 All the thefts included at least one piece from a 17th-century shipwreck, the  Almiranta. 
 If we can figure out who else owns pieces from that shipwreck... 
 We can predict who's gonna be hit next. 
 Now, insurance policies are giving us three potential targets. 
 We're gonna stake out all of them. 
 This couple called in a vacation watch to their alarm company. 
 They'll be gone for a week starting tomorrow. 
 That's a lot of lonely silver. 
 Then that's the address we'll take. 
 This should be fun. 
 ♪ Batman ♪ 
 [ knock on door ] 
 Yeah. 
 You were right. We got a hit. 
 Fowler's insurance settlement. 
 Deposited yesterday. 
 A portion was withdrawn within 40 minutes. 
 ATM? 
 On 32nd street. 
 I did a radius check, pulled traffic cams near the area... got these. 
 Hello, Garrett. 
 Yep. I'm heading out to take a look. 
 Diana, last time Fowler... 
 Tried to shoot me? 
 Yeah, I'm not gonna give him another chance. 
 [ Mozart's Piano Sonata #2 in "F" plays ] 
 [ Music continues ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Repeats melody ] 
 [ Plays sour notes ] 
 Easy! Amadeus. 
 Additive code... 
 Morse, Baudot... 
 Set theory, logarithmic,  and  geographic... every kind of cipher. 
 Unless, um... 
 "Glarvendkkgll"... 
 Means something to you, then it's still just noise. 
 Is there anyone who can help you with this? 
 There's  one  guy. 
 He works at an antique store in the west 30s. 
 Oh. Code breaker? 
 Code  maker. 
 Has a rep for hiding codes in gadgets. 
 Government job? 
 Yes. Just not  our  government. 
 And you trust him? 
 Well, I trust him enough to play him a partial piece of it and not tell him where it came from. 
 Maybe Alex will have our answers. 
 Oh, sure. 
 Perhaps she decoded it already using a stolen silver tea set. 
 How are you gonna talk to Alex, anyway? 
 The FBI's staking out a penthouse. 
 She always does rooftop recon one block away. 
 Oh. Tell her I said "ciao." 
 Will do. 
 Where's Caffrey? 
 Oh his way. 
 Fowler? 
 He was staying in short-term housing a block from that atm. 
 The clerk I.D.'d him off the pictures. 
 He's going by the name Aaron Burgis. 
 He left two days ago. 
 Uhhh. 
 Any hits on that alias? 
 Yeah. And it's a big one. 
 You sure it's Fowler? 
 Are you gonna tell Neal? 
 I don't know if he can handle it. 
 Neal : They're on vacation in Miami. 
 Look down. 
 To the right. 
 The municipal utility van. 
 Caffrey. 
 You're looking very "to catch a thief" tonight. 
 I hope you don't think I'm the little French girl and you're Cary Grant in this scenario. 
 I'd like to think there are similarities. 
 But I'm not here to turn you in. 
 Right. You were just in the neighborhood. 
 If I could reach you like a regular person, maybe it wouldn't have to be this way. 
 Sorry. It's kind of hard to keep in touch with this bull's-eye on my back. 
 So you come out at night to steal the things you fenced, then fence them again? 
 I don't have the luxury to be creative. 
 Who else knows I'm here? 
 Just me and Moz. 
 Oh, and the NYPD if you keep going. 
 They're close to linking the thefts, Alex. 
 I used my friends in the van to get to you first. 
 Why? 
 The music box. 
 You found the code. 
 Tell me you cracked it. 
 I'm lurking on a rooftop, spying into people's windows. 
 Do you think I cracked it?   [ chuckles ] 
 I can get that target off your back once and for all. 
 How? 
 Hit somewhere else tonight. 
 What's my take? 
 The music box. 
 Deja vu, Neal. We've done this. 
 Third time's a charm. 
 The box is sitting in a safe in Diana Barrigan's apartment. 
 Who is she? 
 FBI agent. 
 You want me to break into a fed's apartment? 
 Yeah. She's sitting down in that van right now. 
 And her girlfriend works the night shift. 
 Girlfriend? 
 That must kill you. 
 So what do I do with it once I get it? 
 Return it to the rightful owners. 
 Give it to the Russian museum. 
 The person who wants it will take his eye off you and put it on them. 
 What do you say? 
 You're already dressed for it. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Fowler just became the priority. 
 I need you to look into everything Fowler did with this alias, leading up to the explosion and after. 
 Off the normal channels? 
 Stay away from the office. Can you work from home? 
 I prefer it. 
 Good. 
 Hey. Where are you going? 
 I'm headed home. 
 Why? Why? I thought we were all surveilling tonight. 
 You guys are fine without me. 
 Oh, come on. But it's the van. 
 The van's fun. 
 You hate the van. 
 I like the van when Diana's in it. 
 You're the only thing that smells good in here. 
 Diana : Then take your last whiff, because I'm leaving. 
 All right, Diana has more important things to do than be your potpourri. 
 Besides... 
 I have something important I need to tell you. 
 What's up? 
 You won't admit it, you won't show it, but I know how difficult these last few months have been to you. 
 I'm glad that you trusted me. 
 Of course. 
 I'm returning the favor. 
 This is a receipt for parts used in making the bomb on Kate's plane. 
 It says the buyer's name is Aaron Burgis. 
 Do you know who that is? 
 It's Fowler's alias. 
 [ Beeping ] 
 [ High-pitched beeping ] 
 Diana tracked his purchases and found that. 
 Made one week before the explosion. 
 Fowler bought the explosives and put them on the plane. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 We're closing in on Fowler. 
 Diana has a lead. 
 Good. 
 Neal. Good. 
 
 
 
 [ Beeping ] 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Keys thud ] 
 Christie? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Peter : Are you okay? 
 [ Chuckles ] Yeah. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 Part of me knew it had to be Fowler. 
 If we get him now, we can put him away. 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 [ Beep ] 
 Diana. 
 Is Neal with you? 
 Yes. 
 What's going on? 
 Someone just broke into my house. 
 The music box is gone. 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 [ Sets phone down ] 
 What? 
 Don't do this, Neal. 
 Tell me you didn't do this. 
 Do what? 
 Tell me you didn't steal the music box. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm right here. 
 It's been safe in Diana's apartment for months, and the minute I tell you about it, it disappears. 
 I didn't take it. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You're not gonna get away with this. 
 You're  not. 
 Russian heritage museum received an anonymous gift. 
 Seems an antique music box was left in their delivery drop. 
 They're doing a public showing Sunday? 
 By invitation only, before they ship it back to St. Petersburg. 
 [ Exhales ] 
 Thanks. 
 Neal. 
 Get up here. 
 Wish me luck. 
 You knew the Russians would want to show this off. 
 You're trying to lure Fowler out. 
 Someone  is. 
 Oh, would you stop? 
 You can skip the viewing. 
 Oh, no. I'll be there, but you won't. 
 You can't pull me off this, Peter. 
 I can do whatever I want with you. 
 You're lucky that I don't put you in lockdown. 
 Get out. 
 [ Bell dings ] 
 Oh! Mozzie Mozzie! 
 Konnichiwa, my friend. 
 I have something very intriguing for you. 
 [ Speaking Japanese ] 
 [ Laughs ] 
 [ Laughs ] Oh, yes. 
 It is. 
 Um, can you make a copy? 
 Oh. Of course. 
 [ Speaks Japanese ] 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Got my eyes on you. 
 Oh. This is a surprise. Mm. 
 You come here to add to your stuffed-squirrel collection? 
 Oh. Well, let's just say my day opened up. 
 Oh! How did your black-on-black affair go? 
 I found Alex. That's good. 
 She has no idea how to solve the code. That's bad. 
 And I got benched by Peter. 
 What happened? 
 I had Alex steal the box from Diana and donate it to the Russians. Oh, God. 
 You're trying to draw him out. Mm-hmm. 
 Fowler bought the explosives that blew up Kate's plane. 
 Oh, Neal... 
 Akihiro : Oh. 
 [ Speaks Japanese ] 
 Very interesting. 
 [ laughs ] 
 Oh, excellent. He can help us. 
 Two-parter. 
 Two-part code. Interesting idea. 
 We can each take half. 
 As they say, divide and conquer. 
 [ Speaks Japanese ] 
 Brilliant mind. 
 Akihiro, you flatter me. 
 What he said was... 
 Yeah. Yeah, I-I heard him. 
 [ Speaks Japanese ] 
 Oh, yeah. Okay. Sure. 
 Um, a-are you okay? 
 Yeah. Moz, I'm fine. I'm gonna head home. 
 Ja ne. 
 Ja ne. 
 Work before play, my friend. 
 Two parts. 
 [ Moz and Akihiro conversing indistinctly ] 
 [ Exhales ] 
 Russian heritage museum is invitation only, and they're sticking to that. 
 I pulled this from municipal archives. 
 We can stake out the building. 
 If Fowler shows up, we grab him outside. 
 All right, listen. 
 I want Neal's anklet monitored continuously. 
 You think he'll try something? 
 Neal wants Fowler more than I do, and I can't let that happen. 
 Are you in place? 
 I've got eyes on the front entrance. 
 Where's Caffrey? 
 [ Beep ] 
 He's at home. 
 Let's hope the little guy's there to keep an eye on him. 
 How do I look? 
 Don't answer that. 
 You're inscrutable. 
 You know that, Bugsy? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 They say accessories make the outfit. 
 You buy it? 
 [ Beeps ] 
 Peter, I see Fowler. 
 He's coming your way. 
 Hello. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Invitation, please? 
 Fowler just entered the building. 
 I'm going after him. 
 Stay on the entrance. 
 Invitation, please. 
 FBI. 
 I'm investigating that man you just let in  without  one. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Peter : Fowler! 
 Sir... You can't go up there. 
 I am a federal agent. Where do these stairs lead? 
 The modernist gallery. It's closed for renovations. 
 [ Key jingles ] 
 Ugh. 
 It's locked. Do you have a key? 
 Fowler, open up! 
 You don't know what you're messing with! 
 Let me try this key. 
 Surrender, Fowler, right now! 
 Let it go, Burke! 
 Get that thing open. 
 Neal, we've had a breakthrough of unforeseen magnitude. 
 Akihiro's run-on haiku paired with my rejection of predetermined... 
 Neal? 
 Neal? 
 Oh. 
 Does June know you're up here? 
 Oh, Benjamin Siegelbaum. 
 What has he done?

 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 [ Beep ] 
 Hello. 
 Moz : Suit, we have a code red. 
 Now is not the time, Mozzie. 
 It's a dark day when I turn towards the system instead of recoiling. Just spit it out! 
 Remember when you asked me to tell you if Neal was gonna do something stupid? 
 Well, I regretfully report... 
 That he's out of his anklet. 
 Damn it. But that's not the "stupid" part. 
 He's got a gun. 
 [ Exhales sharply ] [ beep ] 
 [ Ringing, click ] 
 Neal is manipulating his tracking signal. 
 I'm sure he's close. He's armed. 
 If you see him, pursue. 
 Diana : Got it. 
 [ Beep ] 
 Neal, what are you doing? 
 Thank you. 
 You got a party crasher out front. 
 [ Cellphone rings ]

 He's with Fowler. 
 I have five shots left. That's the only warning you get. 
 Whatever you think happ... Tell me why you killed Kate! 
 You blew up the plane to get rid of us! 
 No. 
 What was in it for you? 
 Jesus, Caffrey, you think you're the only one that lost something? 
 Don't play with me, Fowler. 
 You think I wanted to spend the last year of my life chasing you and a stupid box? 
 It cost me everything! 
 My career is over. 
 My wife is gone. 
 [ Thud ] 
 [ Peter grunts ] 
 Stay out of this, Peter! 
 Neal, put the gun down! 
 Neal, don't do this! You  know  he killed Kate. 
 I didn't kill her. 
 Who did? 
 I'm... 
 What do you know? 
 Tell me what you know! 
 You want to kill me, Neal? 
 Go ahead and pull the trigger. 
 Jesus, Fowler, you're not helping this. 
 Neal, do  not  do this. 
 I know you killed her. 
 You killed Kate. 
 Peter : Listen to me. 
 If you pull that trigger, you will regret it for the rest of your life, Neal. 
 You're not a killer. 
 I want him to know how it felt. 
 How  she  felt. 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me, Neal. 
 Neal. 
 Look at me, Neal. Come on. 
 This isn't who you are. 
 Cuff him. 
 How are we gonna handle this? 
 [ handcuffs click ] 
 Call Jones. 
 You two can handle the official bureau response. 
 Take him back to the office, then I'll figure out what to do next. 
 Did you kill her? 
 No. 
 You're gonna tell me who did. 
 I was just like you, Burke. 
 Moving up in the bureau. 
 Beautiful wife. 
 Things were good then. 
 Your wife was murdered. 
 Yeah. 
 Did my best to put the pieces back together, but all I could think about was vengeance. 
 Then out of the blue one day, I get a phone call, anonymous voice, pointing me right to her killer. 
 So I tracked him down. 
 And you killed him. 
 A few days later, I get a package in the mail. 
 It's a video. 
 Of what you had done. 
 Followed by another phone call. 
 Man tells me he can arrange it for me to be transferred into OPR. 
 OPR? 
 Yeah. 
 He had enough clout to make that happen? 
 Yeah. 
 Is he with the bureau? 
 I don't know. 
 After that, he told me if I could get him the music box, the video would disappear. 
 Mm. 
 Give it to your mystery blackmailer... 
 Get your life back. 
 That was our deal. 
 So I traced the box to Caffrey. 
 But he didn't have it. 
 Well, everyone thought he did. 
 But he was in prison. 
 So you went after Kate. 
 I figured she'd know where you kept it. 
 You're the man with the ring. 
 She was signaling you with her ATM card that day, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 It worked. 
 Why'd you buy the explosives? 
 Oh, that was Kate's idea. 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 Look, I set up your getaway... 
 As part of mentor. 
 Oh, mentor was  real? 
 Yeah. 
 Kate felt that no matter how far away you two got, you would never be safe. 
 And I don't think she was wrong. 
 Hey, look... 
 I don't know who the guy is pulling these strings, but I have never seen anyone with the kind of juice he has. 
 So it was her idea to blow up the plane? 
 Yeah. You two bail out over the water. 
 Boom. 
 Fake our death and live happily ever after. 
 The bomb exploded early. Why? 
 I don't know. 
 She called you from the plane. 
 We heard it on the cockpit recording. 
 Kate never called me. 
 Your name was listed on the phone. 
 I'm not that stupid. 
 Boss? 
 Peter : Yeah? 
 The marshals reset the key. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Put it on him. Take him home. 
 Peter, not right now. 
 Go home. 
 [ Rock music plays ] 
 So, what's gonna happen to me? 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 I haven't decided. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You want to help me? 
 The flash drive I got from you the day that I... 
 The day you shot me? 
 Yeah. 
 It contained the date, time, and place of a meeting. 
 Who were you meeting? 
 I had been trying forever to get to the guy pulling the strings. 
 I had finally gotten a meeting with the intermediary. 
 What was the name of the guy you were meeting? 
 I don't know. I was gonna find out that day. 
 You didn't know it? 
 No. 
 I was there. 
 What? 
 [ Men talking indistinctly ] 
 Did you see him? 
 No. He was good. 
 He dodged my cameras. 
 I never got a clear look at him, but... 
 I got this. 
 You know him? 
 Yeah. 
 Julian Larssen. 
 We trained together in special forces. 
 You didn't know he was involved in this? 
 No, I haven't seen him in years. 
 That's our patchwork man. 
 [ Keys clacking ] 
 Excuse me. 
 What's going on? 
 NYPD just called in a homicide in an antique shop downtown. 
 The same antique shop where Neal got his gun. 
 [ Siren wails ] 
 Rule out a snatch and grab? 
 Two shots to the chest. 
 As far as we can tell, nothing was taken. 
 [ Mozart's Piano Sonata #2 in "F" plays ] 
 That was playing when we came in. 
 I'll check it out. 
 [ Music continues ] 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Shop owner was working on the codes. 
 Turn that off. 
 [ Click, music stops ] 
 Let me see that. 
 Diana : "Eureka!" 
 He must have figured  something  out. 
 When you're done with this, it comes to me. 
 How about surveillance tapes? 
 The gunman was smart. Knew to avoid the cameras. 
 But this is interesting. 
 Surveillance tape was cued up to some earlier footage. 
 Neal. 
 He's the next target. 
 What the hell's going on?! 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Hi, Neal. 
 Can I come in? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Sure. 
 Come on in. 
 Neal, pick up! 
 Keep trying. 
 [ Dialing ] 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 Are you gonna answer that? 
 No. 
 [ Ringing stops ] 
 Is the target officially off my back? 
 Whoever wants the box knows you don't have it now. 
 Well, it'll be nice to stop prowling around rooftops for a paycheck. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What about you? 
 Did you get what you need? 
 I found Fowler. 
 But I still don't know who killed Kate. 
 And the code? 
 Moz will crack it. 
 I chased that music box for a long time, Neal. 
 I almost feel guilty I brought you in. 
 Oh, come on. I forced my way in. 
 True, but that's just... what we do. 
 It's kind of sad. 
 It's all coming to an end. 
 Freeze! 
 Hands where I can see them! 
 May I? 
 My number. 
 From now on, I'll answer it. 
 See you around, Neal. 
 I thought we sent you to Italy, Alex. 
 Snuck back in. 
 You are quick on your feet. 
 Like a cat. 
 That silver around your neck... 
 Spanish, by chance? 
 Don't know. 
 See you around. 
 You want to explain the guns? 
 Someone killed Akihiro Tanaka. 
 We thought they were headed here next. 
 Why? 
 Surveillance tapes at the antique shop... 
 Paused on your image. 
 Well, I wasn't there alone. 
 [ Slurping ] 
 Sir? 
 Are you okay? 
 What happened? 
 Have a great day.
