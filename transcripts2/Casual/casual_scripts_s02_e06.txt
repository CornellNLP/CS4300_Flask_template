 Alex : Previously on "Casual"... 
 He brought a date. 
 Jack : This must be so awkward for you. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Jack Briggs. 
 I spent the break in recovery. 
 I'm feeling better. 
 I'm excited to hang out with you guys again. 
 Morning, Alexis. 
 My name's Fallon. 
 Alex, whatever you're thinking, just stop. 
 Valerie : Nothing good happens in Burbank. 
 Alex : What'd you say to Sarah Finn? 
 You were unfaithful to her. 
 Why would you tell her that? 
 I loved her and Dad drove her away. 
 [gasps] Jesus. 
 You look like Clockwork Orange. 
 What do you want? 
 Best wedding gift you and Drew got? 
 I don't know. Cash? 
 Alex : Nothing more memorable? 
 Valerie : Who's it for? 
 Sarah Finn. 
 Why? 
 She's marrying my business partner. 
 It would be rude not to send a gift. 
 I very strongly disagree. 
 Oh, come on. 
 One small gift? 
 Mmmm. 
 It's a wedding! 
 It-it's a cause for celebration. 
 Okay. Okay. Fine. 
 But you're gonna stick to the registry. 
 Get him a potato ricer. 
 Or cups. 
 Cups? 
 No wonder you never get invited out.

 Hey. 
 Quick question: how many cows would it take to really make a statement? 
 50? 100? 
 What? 
 Alex : If you were Sarah. 
 It's for her wedding. 
 Oh, like a dowry? 
 No, less contractual. More emotionally manipulative. 
 Leon : It's 7:30 in the morning. 
 Leon! Come on. 
 What's an undeniable amount of cows? 
 [coughing] 
 Are you okay? 
 Leon : [groans] I'm sick. 
 sh1t. I'm sorry.

 I have two different shoes on. 
 Please. I do that all the time. 
 You do? 
 Yeah. 
 I had a red one and a green one the other day. 
 Oh, Christmasy. 
 You got plans this weekend? 
 Nothin' really. 
 No? 
 Mm-mm. 
 Oh. 
 You should call Harry. Wink, wink. 
 Yeah, I... I guess I should. 
 The title of my future autobiography. 
 [laughs] 
 Um, Jack also asked for your number. 
 Game night Jack? 
 Mm. 
 I didn't give it to him. He's not housebroken. 
 What do you mean, like, he'll pee on my rug or something? 
 Among other places. 
 Well, that sounds messy. 
 It is and not in a good way. 
 Call Harry. 
 Hi, Leia. 
 Hi. 
 Um, I'm doing a juice cleanse today, so I might be a little weird. 
 Just FYI. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Because I'm doing a juice cleanse. 
 Oh, okay. Great. Thanks. 
 Leia : And your 9:00 is here.

 What's up with you? 
 Same sh1t. Different day. 
 We're cool, right? 
 Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? 
 Cool. Thanks. 
 Plane leveled out. 
 Made an emergency landing. 
 Everyone on the plane starts cheering and crying, but I didn't. 
 I realized my life was nothing. 
 I didn't care if the plane crashed. 
 Called Camille, told her it was over. 
 Called my boss, told him pretty much the same thing. 
 Three minutes, I had canceled my entire life. 
 One giant f*ck you to New York. 
 Never even went back for my dry cleaning. 
 Mm. 
 Now I'm happy. 
 Mm. 
 Make my own hours, travel. 
 I own a yurt. 
 Are you finished? 
 [sighs] Yeah, pretty much. 
 [laughs] Okay. 
 Well, I think you have a fear of intimacy, which is not uncommon in adult children of alcoholics. 
 You struggle with commitment and fear of abandonment, but... the fact that you needed a life-threatening plane ride to create agency in your life and the fact that you never went back to New York to face the choices that you've made in your life... 
 I'd say your real issue is with avoidance. 
 When can we do this again? 
 You can do this again, just not with me. 
 Leia will validate your parking. 
 Kicking me out? 
 Well, time's up. 
 All right. 
 So how much do I owe you? 
 Uh, don't take his money. 
 Jack : No, no. I insist. 
 Uh, it's fine. 
 Then I'll buy you dinner to make up for it. 
 Really, it's not necessary.

 Yes.

 Seriously? 
 I mean, it sucks he has a problem, but... since when do people in rehab get care packages?

 Asshole.

 Valerie : So the strangest thing happened to me at work. 
 Anorexic girl try to eat your Kleenex again? 
 No. 
 This man that I met at Jennifer's game night just showed up at my office. 
 Yikes. 
 Yeah, but not for therapy. 
 I mean, kind of for therapy, but I think just to flirt. 
 Oh. 
 That's both creepy and well played. 
 The point is, we're going out to dinner one night this week. 
 Wait. 
 One night this week? 
 Or did he pick an actual day? 
 One night this week. 
 [laughs] 
 Nope. 
 What? 
 Until he picks an actual day, you don't have a date. 
 "One night this week" could just as easily mean literally never again. 
 So should I call him and firm things up? 
 No! 
 It's a waiting game now. A battle of wills. 
 So I'm supposed to keep every night open until he calls? 
 Val, just double-book and go to the more fun thing. 
 Have you never used a calendar? 
 [phone chimes] 
 It's not him. 
 [phone chiming] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Yes? 
 Sorry. Um, are you around tomorrow? 
 I'm around right now. 
 Can I stop by after work tomorrow? 
 Sure, Drew. 
 Drew : Thank you, Valerie. 
 Hey, man. 
 Thanks for the cow. 
 Very, very kind of you. 
 You mean cows, right? 
 I donated 100. 
 Oh, well, they don't show us the number.

 Of course. 
 Anything for a good cause.

 Hey, Fallon. 
 He's busy, Alex. What do you want? 
 Uh, I'm here for you, actually. 
 I wanted to pick your brain about something. 
 Okay. 
 I need a wedding gift for the happy couple. 
 Something really special. 
 How about a livestock donation? 
 I was hoping for something more Sarah-specific. 
 Maybe something that's not on the registry. 
 What about something from her store? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, good idea. 
 I'll get some chairs. 
 I can help you pick them out, if you want. 
 No, that's okay. Thanks, though. 
 Fallon : Seriously. 
 I just want to be helpful. 
 Yeah? 
 Absolutely. 
 Give me your credit card number and I'll take the order. 
 How many do you want? Four? Six? 
 Eh. 
 Let's do eight. 
 Eight? 
 Yeah. 
 Look at you. 
 I'm a partner. 
 If you were Spencer, what would you want in a care package? 
 Like, don't think about it. 
 Just, you get the package, you open it up. 
 What's in it? 
 Not cancer? 
 Ha-ha. 
 I don't know. 
 This all feels sad. 
 Books and movies? 
 It's basically a collection of other people's stories because yours is ending. 
 Make sure you write that on his card. 
 Hey, what are you up to on Friday? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 I may have stuff. 
 Okay. 
 Well, if you decide to stop being weird, you should come with me to a party at USC. 
 The guy who's hosting it's a PoliSci major with an eight-inch cock. 
 PoliSci? 
 I know, right? 
 Might as well be ceramics. 
 Yeah, I guess that could be fun. 
 Aubrey : Cool. 
 You know, I think that's what Spencer would want. 
 He would want us to drink and dance and listen to music. 
 He'd want us to live. 
 Yeah. You're right. 
 I don't believe this. 
 I don't know why JoAnne would lie. 
 Because she's crazy? She walks her cats. 
 She said she saw two teenage girls hanging around outside my garage on the night my bikes were stolen. 
 Or you left the garage door open again, like you always do. 
 No. 
 Mae-Yi has a very sweet, very gentle way of reminding me to keep it locked. 
 Okay. [laughs] 
 Oh. Okay. 
 You don't think there's any possibility that Laura could have done it? 
 She doesn't seem angry or frustrated? 
 I don't know. She's a teenager. 
 Okay? 
 It doesn't mean she's out committing grand larceny. 
 There it is. The denial. 
 Like an old sweater that you put on at first chill of reality. 
 Oh, you're wearing a f*cking tech vest!

 Laura. 
 Hi, Dad. 
 Valerie : You know what? You're her father. 
 You talk to her. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm not your go-between. 
 What's up? 
 You didn't, uh, borrow me and Mae-Yi's road bikes last Saturday, did you? 
 No. Why? 
 Because they've gone missing from the locked garage. 
 Look, I just found out that my friend has cancer and it's a little hard for me to think about bikes right now.
