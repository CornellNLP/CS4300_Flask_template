 Laura : Previously on "Casual"... 
 So I've been thinking, what if I bought out your half of the house? 
 Why? 
 Mae-yi and I are thinking ahead. 
 Drew : To the future. 
 Why didn't you say anything real? 
 Aubrey : Look, you don't have to front. 
 We just want to get to know you. 
 Laura : Someone has a friend crush. 
 Valerie : She's just effortless. 
 Laura : I'm sure she likes you too. 
 Alex : Why don't I cook you up a proper feast? 
 Alex. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. I want you to meet my fiancée, Sarah. 
 Alex Cole. 
 Jordan : You two know each other? 
 Why is your ex-girlfriend at the house? 
 Alex : I don't know. The last time I saw her, she broke into my apartment and stole all my lightbulbs. 
 Even the one in the fridge!

 Good morning, Mr. Cole. 
 Alexis. 
 Mr. Cole? 
 Uh-huh. 
 That sounds weird. 
 It's growing on me. 
 Alex : So this is the bullpen. 
 Paul's right here. 
 Jordan's next door, if we need him. 
 Love the space. 
 Right? 
 Yeah, great fêng shui. 
 You must be so productive. 
 Really turning a corner. 
 I kind of want to work here. 
 Maybe after graduation. 
 Good morning, Mr. Cole. 
 Alexis. 
 And I'm right here. 
 Alex, hi. 
 Why are you in my office? 
 Did Jordan not talk to you? 
 No, I just got in. 
 Sarah : sh1t. 
 This is awkward. 
 What's going on? 
 I'm overseeing the restructuring and Jordan thought since you're never here, it would be all right if I'd use this as my home base. 
 My office? No, that's not all right. 
 We should go. 
 No, stay here. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Uh... 
 I'm gonna go talk to Jordan. 
 You might want to put on some clothes first.

 They're fine. 
 Alex is better. 
 Alex is unstable. 
 Totally. 
 And now he's off his meds. 
 I'm kidding. He's been off for years. 
 Good to know you're not lacking for male role models. 
 Aww. 
 Are you afraid I'm gonna become a stripper? 
 The thought had crossed my mind. 
 Well, relax. 
 I won't be desperate to pay off student loans for at least four years. 
 Good. 
 With any luck, I'll be dead by then. 
 What did you want to talk about, anyway? 
 Mae-yi, actually. 
 Oh. 
 Um, she's finishing medical school next year. 
 Graduation. 
 Are you gonna get her a gift, or just tuck a check into her card? 
 Can you be serious for just one second? 
 This conversation is so absurd. 
 [clears throat] 
 She, uh, wants to time it out so that she can have a baby before she begins her residency, if possible. 
 Oh. 
 It's just, you know, something she cares about. 
 So I wanted to... let you know that there's a chance. 
 That I could have a new baby brother? 
 Or sister. 
 Aww. 
 That's great. 
 I-I hope it happens for you. 
 Thank you.

 He knows. 
 Valerie : What? 
 Jordan. He knows about me and Sarah. 
 Didn't you sort of expect this? 
 Okay, yeah, maybe. 
 But not that he'd punish me. 
 He's created a hostile working environment. 
 Valerie : What's he doing? 
 Reminding me about meetings and calendar invites, telling me when to get to work. 
 That's pretty standard office stuff. 
 Alex : No, Val, this is a power play. 
 He's trying to steal my company. 
 Okay, Alex. 
 Also, his wedding registry has a link for donating cows. 
 I mean, that's manipulative, right? 
 Look at me. I don't need gifts. 
 Just charity. It's totally self-serving. 
 Valerie : Okay, I'm hanging up now. 
 Wait. 
 [sighs] 
 No phones in the examination room. 
 I know. 
 What if I needed it for moral support? 
 Well, I see you changed your home address and emergency contact into. 
 Yeah, Drew and I are no longer living together, but it's fine. It's better, actually. 
 More time for me, you know? 
 You know. 
 Scoot down, please. 
 Any recent sexual activity? 
 Uh, nothing regular. 
 Just a few things here and there. 
 Dr. Desai : Still on the Ocella? 
 And condoms. 
 It's all very impersonal and exciting. 
 Dr. Desai : Hmm. 
 Have you considered something more permanent? 
 Uh, like what? 
 Well, there are a couple options. 
 Tubal ligation is the most popular. 
 You mean sterilization? 
 I assume you've finished having children. 
 It would be a lot easier than taking a daily pill. 
 I think I'd like to keep my options open. 
 At your age there aren't that many options.

 Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. 
 My husband rented the "Minions" movie. 
 Have you seen it? 
 What? 
 It's so funny. 
 They don't even talk, but they make these cute little noises.

 Oh, goodness. 
 Okay. 
 Everything looks good here.

 Fourth page. 
 Jordan : Nice. 
 I like the tagline. 
 I thought we were moving away from this.

 This looks like an eHarmony ad. 
 Kiel : eHarmony's the benchmark. 
 They fully monetized desperation. 
 Okay, fine, but we're selling something different, right? 
 The anti-partnership. 
 The... the fun of the chase. 
 Our customers don't need to know that. 
 Oh, they don't? 
 So long as they're satisfied with the experience, what does it matter, right? 
 I think I'd want to know. 
 Okay. Well, uh... ownership is all accounted for. 
 Let's put it to a vote. 
 Paul, what do you think of this direction?

 Would you ever think about freezing your eggs? 
 I already did. 
 Graduation present from the parents. 
 Wow. Smart. 
 I wanted a car. 
 I thought you didn't want kids. 
 Well, not now. 
 But I mean, I'll cave eventually. 
 You read that "New York Times" article, right? 
 W-which one? 
 You know, the one about the people who die alone in their apartments? 
 And how it takes, like, months to find them. 
 And their bodies are all withered and gross. 
 Basically, dying alone is the ultimate indignity. 
 Worse than spending your life with someone you don't love? 
 I don't know. 
 But what's really the worst is if you just have a cat. 
 Because when it runs out of food, it will literally eat your face. 
 Got it. 
 No cat. 
 Alex : Those are expired. 
 Have you seen your mom? 
 Nope. 
 My ex-girlfriend is marrying my new business partner. 
 Okay. 
 That's f*cked up, right? 
 Did he know you dated her? 
 I don't know. 
 Did she tell him to buy your company? 
 No idea. 
 Look, I haven't seen her in, like, 10 years. 
 I thought she was in a mental institution in Oklahoma. 
 Oklahoma? 
 Or Arkansas. I don't know. 
 Some state where they don't let you out. 
 You can go talk to her. 
 Grow down, will you? 
 
 
 
 Alex : [sighs] 
 What'd you tell him? 
 Huh? 
 Jordan. 
 What'd you say about us? 
 Uh, I didn't say anything to Jordan. 
 Sure you didn't. 
 Well, I thought I'd spare him the gory details. 
 You mean your descent into madness? 
 Yes, Alex, sure. 
 I mean, stealing lightbulbs? 
 That's some Van Gogh level stuff. 
 I'm surprised you didn't send me an ear. 
 You used to appreciate originality. 
 It's a fine line. 
 Let's not do this, okay? 
 I'm with someone I love. 
 The person you love is trying to take over my company. 
 No, he's not. 
 You would say that. 
 Listen, whatever it is you told him... 
 I only told him what he needed to know, okay? 
 Will you just buy a chair or something? 
 I'll sell it to you at cost. 
 I don't need a chair. 
 Okay. 
 What, you don't like my furniture? 
 It's a little unfocused. 
 No, it isn't.

 It's 11:30. 
 Jesus, man. 
 Maybe I don't like coming in at 9:00, okay? 
 Maybe I think it's a holdover from when children worked 16 hours a day at the smelting mill. 
 Okay, man, what's going on with you? 
 You've been on my ass all week and it's getting really f*cking tired. 
 Seriously? 
 Yeah, seriously. 
 And I know Sarah told you some big f*cking story about us, but it doesn't mean you have to treat me like a leper. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 Sarah told me you dated and all she said was that you had a nice relationship until some stuff went down with your family. 
 Wait, what? 
 But you know what, Alex? I don't care. 
 Okay? I knew your reputation before I came on board and it didn't stop me. 
 What reputation? 
 [chuckles] Come on, man. 
 You can't be that naive. 
 Are we cool? 
 We're business partners. 
 Let's just shoot for, uh, civil. 
 We still on for later?

 I could probably steal a bottle from my mom. 
 She won't miss it.

 You're a traveling pharmacy. 
 Yeah, one-stop shop. 
 So if I wanted to turn my brain off and just feel warm? 
 You would eat half of this.

 Now, you are currently without a partner? 
 Yes. It's just me. 
 California Cryo Preserve has a list of potential donors online. 
 You can read personal essays, see childhood photographs... 
 Right, and if I want to just freeze eggs? 
 You could try. 
 The technology has improved, but it's certainly nowhere near the success rate for fertilized embryos. 
 Also, embryos are less expensive. 
 So I'm penalized for being single?

 She knew? 
 Yes, of course, she knew. 
 I told her. 
 What? 
 Why? 
 Why would you tell her that? 
 Well, she had a right to know. 
 But you just didn't tell me? 
 You let me believe, for all these years, she just lost her mind? 
 You were emotionally unprepared for that relationship.

 Sure. 
 To Cupid, god of relationships, accept our humble tribute. 
 May the twisted spokes and broken handlebars satisfy your thirst for blood. 
 Thirst for blood? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Cupid loves blood.
