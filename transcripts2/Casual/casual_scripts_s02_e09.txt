 Laura : Previously on "Casual"... 
 Now you know that if you marry Jordan, you will spend every day thinking about me. 
 You want to ruin my life again? 
 Ruin it for yourself. 
 Valerie : Why was she here, Alex? 
 Why was she in your house? 
 You take care of your relationships, I'll take care of mine. 
 I'm gonna burn your company to the ground. 
 Sarah told you, huh? 
 Jennifer : Jack mentioned that he had a really good time with you. 
 Valerie : He did? I mean, yeah. We did. I had fun. 
 I went back and he was gone. 
 Just checked out of the hotel. 
 I... I have the wrong room. 
 Shouldn't have gone over there. 
 I mean, one conversation on a roof. 
 Probably a normal Thursday for him. 
 Text me. Call me. But don't disappear. 
 Okay. 
 Laura : I mean, all I wanted was a friend. 
 Is that so unreasonable? 
 Valerie : The more you're dishonest with her, the worse it's gonna get. 
 I thought it would be easier with a girl. 
 Why would you ever think that? 
 [birds chirping] 
 Hey. 
 Spencer : Mm? 
 Get up. 
 Spencer : Let me sleep. 
 I heard Alex in the garage. 
 I think he got the shotgun. 
 You don't have a shotgun. 
 Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't. 
 I guess you just got to ask yourself one question. 
 [chuckles] Do I feel lucky? 
 Can you dodge buckshot in your weakened state? 
 f*cking nuthouse. 
 You love it. 
 Whatever. 
 Good luck today. 
 Thanks. 
 Don't eat or drink anything beforehand. 
 Okay, Mom. 
 What? 
 I thought I'd just skip right to the nagging stage of our relationship. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I'll bring you dinner later? 
 No. 
 Yes.

I got all day. Cancel your afternoon. No. No. Why? Becau... Patients cancel on you, right? How many appointments do you have? I have one. Uh, is it a suicidal situation?

Did I not tell you that this would happen? Did I not tell you that this would totally blow up in your face? [sighs] We'll take care of it. Who? You and Leon? Yeah. Me and Leon. He's a sound tech. Composer. He's a composer. Supposed to be at the lake. I'm supposed to be eating a sandwich, but no, I don't get to. Val... ...deal with this. Val, give me that. Give it to me.

Deadlines. You play darts? The Grawmeyer Prize? Yeah. It's a long shot, but why not? What's that? Good on you. Fingers crossed. Cheers, mate. Alex : Okay. Can we get back to this? Oh, yeah, um, morality clauses, they're almost impossible to uphold. So it's an empty threat? Well, is your other partner on board with this? Who? Paul? I don't know. Well, if he's not, then it's just an inconvenience. We should all play darts sometime. It'd be fun. [keyboard clicking on phone] [light music playing] ♪ ♪

Like Bob from "What About Bob?" You don't know "What About Bob?" I... I... yeah, I know it's a movie. I... that I haven't seen. Really? Bill Murray, he plays, like, a crazy person who invades his therapist's life. He marries his daughter and has to move in. And then Richard Dreyfuss plays the therapist and he has a stroke or something and has to silently watch as his life crashes in. It's dark as sh1t. Um, do you mind if we make a pit stop? Sure.

Oh, they're coming. Once he's bled me dry, he'll turn on you. What, you don't believe me? You're not the most reliable narrator. Remember when we started? When I first decided to strike out on my own? They said, "You don't want Paul. "You want Auggie Bremmer. "He's the guy that can launch a product. He's triple A rated." Alex. And what'd I say? What'd I say, Paul? You said Auggie Bremmer was a weasel and you wanted me to steer the ship. Yes, and I need you back behind that wheel. Come on. What do you want me to do? We sit him down and say we will not be intimidated. You and I will not be pushed around. We started this f*cking company. We are Snooger. It's not even a real word. No, it's not. We made it up.

Oh, I'm just waiting for you to leave so I can look for pain pills. Mm-hmm. I don't like her. Mm. Me neither. Call me if she gets out of hand. Awfully territorial. Mm, ah, I'm her favorite. Yeah, I bet. I feel for her though. It's a tough beat. Cancer ward? Yeah, a lot of turnover. Yeah. So what is that stuff? Chemical cocktail. It's a new batch of poison. Is it any good? Doubt it. It's worth a shot though. Yeah, it's not my first trial. You know, at some point, you got to stop pretending. There are worse things. Hi, kids. Oh, sh1t. Two for the price of one? Leave no man behind. Right? [birds chirping] Is that the same patient? Uh, yeah. It's... it's a full-time job. Must be hard to be so invested in other people. I like to think I help them. Or you enable them. Can we put the phone away and enjoy me here? Look at this, there's trees, there's the sun shining. This is a beautiful day. ♪ Fishing, floating ♪ 
♪ Making memories and sh1t at High Trail Lake ♪ Or whatever it goes. I don't know. Come on, this is your spot. This is great. Actually, I'm... I've, um, I've never been here before.

Cash. You don't think there's a hypersexualized quality to Selena Gomez? Oh, of course I do. It's just not new. Like Britney, Christina, Shakira... their empires are built on the bones of 12-years-olds. [clicks tongue] I love Shakira. Mm. Shocker. I also love Ciara and she's a born-again now. Ah, tapping into a whole new market of confused sexuality. Whatever gets you radio play. Laura : You still listen. Spencer : Of course I listen. Who doesn't listen? I listen. I do too. Hey, when did you guys start f*cking behind my back? Uh, behind your back? Oh, so you... you weren't trying to keep it a secret? Why would we do that? No reason. Just... I mean, we had a thing. Is that what you thought? I mean, it felt pretty clear when we were making out on the street or having s*x in that guy's dorm room. Well, I, uh, I guess we just feel differently. sh1t. You're cold. I'm sorry. I... Jesus Christ, just f*cking feel something. Are you afraid to admit that you like a girl? Are you worried that this identity might stick? I guess I just like him better. [laughs] Okay. [sighs] Hey. Stop. Leave me alone. Why can't we just be friends? It doesn't work that way. I can't just turn it off. I shouldn't have done it. Then why did you, if you don't even like me? I thought it was what you wanted. So it was a pity f*ck? God, that's even worse. I'm sorry. It's not that. It's... It was fun and then... I don't know. [scoffs] Good luck with Spencer. Hope he dies before you get bored with him too. ♪ ♪ All you had to do was nothing. Sit back and collect a paycheck. You had the American dream and you forced yourself awake. Alex : I don't want your blood money. You want to run this company? You do it with me in tow. Fine. You can hang around, watch me fire your employees. Watch me blackball them in the industry. You know they'll blame you, the founder. The guy who started it all. Or you can sign. They all get to keep their jobs and Snooger becomes a line item on a spreadsheet I glance at every other quarter. $65,000. One year's salary for my personal assistant. Oh, by the way, tell Sarah I say hello. You two deserve each other. [soft music] ♪ ♪ Valerie : It should be here. Jack : I'm pretty sure we'd notice a lake. Valerie : No, but it should be here. I mean, where the f*ck is it? Right? Hey, excuse me! Hi. Hi. We're looking for High Trail Lake. Oh, you're... you're standing in it. Drought dried it up. Jack : [laughs] Valerie : Wow. The drought dried it up. Of course. [laughter] Of course there's no lake. [sighs] Why would there be a lake? It's not like it formed millions of years ago and sat, slowly evaporating into goddamn, f*cking nothing. Why would there be a lake? [laughing] Okay. Well, let's... I mean, I fell for it this time. I really... I really did. I thought, "It's gonna be different this time. It's... it's gonna happen." Okay, let's take some deep breaths, we'll regroup... Okay, you know what? Just f*ck off. I'm sorry. I... It's just, you live in a f*cking hotel room. And that's great. That's your life. But I have people who need me. Like, need me, and when I go looking for the lake, I leave them behind. Who? Who are you talking about here? Your brother? Um, he cannot take care of himself, so if I don't do it... Then what? If he needs your help, then why hasn't he called you? Do you need an excuse?
