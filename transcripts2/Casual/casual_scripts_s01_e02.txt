 He was so blessed to have kids like you. 
 You use your own dating site? 
 I wrote the matching algorithm. 
 Are you his date? 
 Yeah. 
 Hayden : Okay, that's his sister, and they were shit-talking us back here. 
 I want full custody. 
 Where are you two going to live? 
 Valerie : With Alex. 
 Emile : It's just weird, you all living in this house together. 
 Do you want to have s*x or not? 
 Uh, we're heading out. 
 Okay. 
 You ever online date? 
 To the men of Snooger.com, you are the ideal 36-year-old woman. 
 You want to stop thinking about Drew, go be with somebody. 
 I'm Valerie.

 Morning! Breakfast is almost up. 
 [Alex murmuring] 
 Alex : All right. 
 We're out of buttermilk. 
 Also, one of these got stuck in the griddle, but that's fine. I can eat it. 
 They're just better with buttermilk, which is surprising 'cause buttermilk's disgusting. 
 But when it comes to batter, there's just no substitute. 
 So you're over in Silver Lake, right, Leon? 
 Uh, how'd you know that? 
 You left your wallet on the counter. 
 Also, your AAA card is expired. 
 Oh. 
 I've thought about moving east, but traffic's such a pain. 
 Alex : Morning, Val. Just in time. 
 Get 'em while they're hot. 
 Alex : Mmm, mmm. 
 Oh, my God. That is good. 
 Alex, can I talk to you for a second? 
 I like him. 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
 Um, lots of things. 
 You invited him to breakfast? 
 Yeah, I wanted to make waffles. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Don't you think you should have asked me first? 
 Oh, my God. It's fine. He's cool. 
 He's a one-night stand. 
 Good review for King Lear at The Broad. 
 You, uh, like theater? 
 No. 
 You just seem uncomfortable. 
 I thought I should say something. 
 So your, um, mom and your uncle... 
 Yeah, regular Bonnie and Clyde. 
 They're... close? 
 Yeah. 
 It's actually pretty normal. 
 Except when they shower together. 
 Leon, I'm f*cking with you. 
 Hey, come on, Laura. Let's go. 
 We're always late for school. 
 Uh, no, don't get up. 
 Just... finish your waffle. 
 Alex can see you out. 
 Okay, um, I'll, um... call you? 
 Uh, uh... okay, great. 
 [door closes] 
 Well, she's in a mood. Can you pass the syrup? 
 [soft music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I'm sorry you had to see that. 
 What? The strange man at the breakfast table? 
 It was a lapse in judgment, and I reacted poorly. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm okay if you're okay. 
 Okay. 
 So how was he? 
 Hmm? 
 First times can be awkward. 
 He seemed awkward. 
 Uh, does that seem like an appropriate question for me? 
 You asked me after Emile and my first time. 
 Yeah, that's different. 
 If you say so. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Seemed like he was holding something back. 
 Like he was unable to engage, which can happen sometimes with new partners. 
 You psychoanalyzed him like he was one of your patients? 
 I did not. 
 Sounds like attachment issues. 
 Well, that's your words, not mine. 
 Definitely attachment issues. 
 [sighs] 
 Hey, I'm getting a latte. You want anything? 
 My brother made breakfast for my one-night stand. 
 Oh. 
 You should be upset. 
 I-I-I am. 
 Anyway, I-I'm fine. 
 I'm fine. It's fine. 
 I'm just gonna... I just need to distract myself and go for a jog or something. 
 Jogging is sad. 
 Go spinning. 
 Spinning? 
 [scoffs] It's the best. 
 One girl I ride with, Rachel, she got divorced, started spinning, and now she's gonna ride up Mount Everest. 
 I think that's impossible. 
 Right? 
 It totally changes your mind-set. 
 Also, after I ride, I can drink guilt-free with my friends... who you should totally come meet tonight. 
 Oh, that's very, very sweet but unnecessary. 
 No, I'm serious. They've been asking about you. 
 They have? 
 Duh! 
 You're, like, this woman who knows things. 
 I talk about you all the time. 
 Come on. It'll be fun. 
 Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. 
 Great.

 I'm sure he means well. 
 I'm not sure what he means.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Uh, can I ask you something... about your sister? 
 Sorry if that's inappropriate. 
 It is, but I don't care. 
 Uh, should I call her? 
 Yeah, so the thing with Val is, her ex-husband is a colossal douche wagon and she's just now getting back into the dating scene. 
 Douche wagon? 
 Yeah, like a douche canoe but worse. 
 Right. 
 Anyway. 
 It's great that she's dating 'cause she's great, but it's also kind of tough because she's not looking for anything serious. 
 I see. 
 Yeah. 
 You gotta differentiate between the one-night stands and the relationships, Leon. That's key. 
 And what if I don't want a one-night stand? 
 Uh... okay. 
 Um, well, you find the middle ground. 
 Hookups without emotional investment. 
 You actually do that? 
 I invented a website for its express purpose. 
 So if I call Val... 
 She'll shut you out, make you a one-off. 
 But if I don't, then... 
 She'll get lonely, have a few drinks, text you. 
 Once you get that second night, the doors are open. 
 And in the meantime? 
 Meet some other girls, date around. 
 [scoffs] 
 [sighs] 
 What? 
 Ah, no, nothing. 
 Talk to me, Leon. 
 [chuckles] I barely know you. 
 You had s*x with my sister. I made you breakfast. 
 Okay, uh... the thing is, uh... 
 [sighs] 
 That I've been in a kind of a dry spell. 
 Mm-hmm. Define dry. 
 Ten months. 
 Wow. Post breakup? 
 Uh, dated for three years, engaged for another. 
 A month before the wedding, I found tapes. 
 Tapes? Like VHS? 
 Yup. 
 A collection of all the men and women she'd ever been with up to and including the time that we were together. 
 Whoa.

 Couldn't sleep. Couldn't move. 
 Huh.
