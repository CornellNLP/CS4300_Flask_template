 Previously on "Casual"... 
 Hi, Grandma. 
 Why are you at Alex's house? 
 My mom and I are staying here since the divorce. 
 Valerie got divorced? 
 Valerie : Laura and I have to go look at houses later this afternoon. 
 What's wrong with my house? 
 You knew we weren't gonna live here forever. 
 I do now. 
 You fat-shamed a journalist. 
 The bartender that wrote a blog post that got picked up by Jezebel. 
 Alex : I've just never slept with someone for their personality. 
 Thank you. I learned a lot. 
 We should go shooting sometime. 
 Yeah, that would be fun. 
 I've been going through sort of a hard time lately, and I'm... I'm gonna try some new things. 
 Laura : "Hi, Valerie. I'm a 47-year-old DILF looking for my MILF. Kisses and bites, Marky." 
 DILF? 
 Marky? 
 Ooh. 
 Okay, "I regret to report that you are above the maximum standard of attraction. Please delete your account immediately. JK, coffee?" 
 Oof. Next. 
 [sighs] Okay. 
 Too sweaty. 
 Too smiley. 
 Too goatee-y. 
 [phone dings] 
 Whoa! There you go. 
 Oh, oh, come on! 
 Don't look at that. Don't look at that. 
 Please stop pretending that I haven't seen a dick before. 
 Okay, fine, but seriously. 
 Looks pretty serious to me. 
 You know what, that's harassment. 
 No, it's the new "hello." 
 [phone dings] 
 Oh, Dad's texting you. 
 He says he wants you to call him. 
 Ugh. 
 I mean, your father and I respect each other very much, and I will call him back later. 
 Nice. 
 [phone dings] 
 Ugh, I mean, it's inappropriate and sleazy. 
 It can't possibly work. 
 And yet it somehow does. 
 sh1t. 
 Laura : What? 
 Valerie. 
 Couldn't just let me have my divorce on my own, huh? 
 Everyone needs their mother at a time like this. 
 So you've come for... dinner? 
 I'm here as long as you need me. 
 Hey, Grandma. 
 Call me Dawn. 
 Call her Grandma. 
 It makes me so happy to see you all living together. 
 Well, we did it for 18 years back at the house, which you would have noticed if you'd been around. 
 [laughs] I miss your sense of humor. 
 So Alex tells me you're dating? 
 [grunts] 
 Hmm? 
 What are you looking at? 
 Comments about how I'm unlovable and my website's a scam. 
 Unlovable? 
 That sounds self-destructive. 
 It is. 
 Then maybe you should stop. 
 It serves a purpose. 
 It's good to get out there. 
 The world is calling. You should answer. 
 Well, it's only been a few months, Mom. 
 Well, at your age, every month counts. 
 I smell something like smoke. 
 I don't smell any... oh, yeah. 
 Why aren't you stepping in? 
 It's kind of fun to watch. 
 Do you hear her? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you hear how overjoyed about my divorce she is? 
 Of course she is, Val. She gets to act like an expert. 
 Oh, my God, I want to murder her. 
 I do, I want to twist her f*cking neck until her smug face pops off. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop. 
 You want her gone? 
 Yes. 
 Then just let her be right. 
 Whatever she says, you nod and agree. 
 That's idiotic. 
 It's effective. 
 You and Grandpa... I mean Charles... 
 You were never married? 
 Not officially. 
 We never wanted to contractually own one another. 
 So you were, like, sleeping with other people? 
 Naturally. 
 Let's practice. Okay? 
 Alex... 
 So, Valerie... 
 Global warming is a total hoax, am I right? 
 Alex, stop. 
 Am I right? 
 Yeah, that sounds right. 
 Very good. 
 Best Clint Eastwood movie, it's got to be Trouble with the Curve, don't you think? 
 Such a good movie. 
 [sighs] It was a revelation. 
 See? You got it. 
 But you were together? 
 Until we split up, yes. 
 And how did Mom and Alex feel about that? 
 I never really asked. 
 But we needed to. It was time. 
 It was organic. We never rushed into things. 
 It was like I always told you. 
 You were so young when you got married... too young. 
 This divorce is giving you a tremendous gift. 
 Thanks, divorce. 
 [sighs] I need to vent. 
 Do you have a sec? 
 Mm... 
 'Cause I need... 
 Um... 
 What? 
 Sorry. 
 Okay, you can't just show up here. 
 You won't return my texts. 
 If you want to meet, you have to go through the lawyers. 
 Is that really where we are? 
 What do you need now? 
 It's time to sell the house. 
 Not yet. 
 Drew : When? 
 When I'm ready. 
 You don't get to control everything. 
 You left. 
 [scoffs] 
 You're the one who said, "I never want to step foot in that house again," remember? 
 [cell phone chiming] 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I remember. I remember. 
 Doesn't mean I'm ready to sell it, though. 
 I can box things up for you. 
 The leather bar stools, the doorknobs that you got in Big Sur. 
 Ugh. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 You know what? 
 Until we reach an agreement, that house... it's 50% mine, and you are not to put it on the market.

 Are you sneaking in? 
 Are you hiding behind a plant? 
 Who are those people? 
 She got us a throuple's massage. 
 Valerie : A what? 
 [cell phone chimes] 
 Oh, Jesus. That's three. 
 Three what? 
 pen1s pictures. 
 They're called dick pics. 
 Whatever. 
 Same photo? 
 No... see, first one's an aerial shot, and the second one's next to a remote. 
 Uh-huh, for perspective. 
 Yeah, but every remote is different, so. 
 Yeah, a soda can would be a better barometer. 
 Probably. 
 Hm. 
 Oh, sh1t. Uh, here she comes. 
 I'm gonna... 
 Wait, wait... wait. 
 Where are you going? 
 Um, anywhere but here. 
 No, no, no. 
 Wait... hey, what happened to saying yes and, you know, nodding and agreeing? 
 Yeah, with words. You don't do stuff with her. 
 Oh, good, you're here. We can start. 
 Oh, I just got called into the office. 
 So it looks like it's just you gals. 
 I understand. 
 And don't worry about that blogger. 
 Just because no one has loved you yet doesn't mean you're unlovable. 
 [therapeutic music] 
 I'm sensing tension in her back. 
 Work her shoulders. 
 I think she knows what she's doing. 
 She doesn't know what you've been through. 
 It's a divorce. 
 Oh, that's right. 
 That's what it is. It's a divorce. 
 You can't be so hard on yourself, dear. 
 We all make mistakes. 
 Is it better if we just don't talk, maybe? 
 Have you met Drew's new partner? 
 [sighs] I have not. 
 You should, so you can unburden yourself. 
 Start fresh. 
 How did he meet her? 
 [sighs] 
 Can we just... can we change the music? 
 Is that...? 
 But it's so soothing. 
 The thing that really gets me down is we had chemistry. 
 We connected. 
 I mean, she was a four. Maybe five, tops. 
 I could throw a shoe down Sunset, hit 50 better looking girls. 
 Not that I'm perfect, but I was definitely out of her league. 
 Is it wrong that I expected gratitude? 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe that's too much, but I certainly did not expect to be treated like a f*cking monster. 
 Where's Carl? 
 Who? 
 Your dog. 
 Mm. 
 Carl. You were right. 
 He deserved better. I had to give him back. 
 I thought you said this was an emergency. 
 Huh? It is. My mom's in town. 
 You know how that goes. 
 I never met my mother. 
 You're adopted? 
 No. 
 She just left when I was young. 
 Lucky you. 
 You ready? 
 Let's do it.

 She was pre-med and just looking for some nice people outside of school. 
 He wasn't even attracted to her at first. 
 You... talked to Drew? 
 Her car had trouble starting one afternoon, and he bought her a coffee and offered to wait with her.

 Oh, my God.

 Do women actually respond? 
 I mean, you're here. 
 I am literally on the verge of getting a restraining order. 
 Take it easy. 
 No, Randy. 
 I have seen more angles of your pen1s than I have of my ex-husband's. 
 Why didn't you look at your husband's pen1s more? 
 Because he's too busy plunging it into a 22 year-old grad student who he... apparently is also his cycling buddy. 
 Oh, how did I know that? 
 Because my mother called him and asked him. 
 Oh, no. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You didn't want to know. 
 No, I did not want to know. 
 No. No, and now I do.

 I've never heard of a marriage fixing itself. 
 Oh, and now he wants to sell the house. 
 The house that I paid for and filled with all the pieces of our lives. 
 And then when it sells, then that's the end, right? 
 Then... that's it. 
 The end. 
 God, we might not have ever been... right together, but... 
 I'm just not ready for that. 
 But, I mean, if you were never right together, then why are you still, like, holding on? 
 [poignant string music] 
 Because then my mother will be right. 
 She said it would never last. 
 [sighs] And it didn't. 
 And if you keep the house, then she'll be what?

 Imprint?

 That's not a real thing. 
 Actually, there's 50 years of research to support it. 
 So I've heard. 
 So, what happens to that kid when they grow up? 
 If they don't bond? 
 They have attachment issues, and it's basically impossible for them to sustain relationships.
