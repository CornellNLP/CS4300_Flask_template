 Alex : Previously on "Casual"... 
 My ex-girlfriend is marrying my new business partner. 
 Okay. 
 I thought she was in a mental institution in Oklahoma. 
 I'm with someone I love. 
 The person you love is trying to take over my company. 
 This man that I met at Jennifer's game night just showed up at my office. 
 Yikes. 
 Valerie : But not for therapy. 
 I think just to flirt. 
 Come in. 
 Paz : Spencer's gone back into treatment. 
 It would be nice if some of you could put together a care package for him. 
 Laura and I can do it. 
 Spencer's care package. 
 Laura : A bra shot? 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 Jennifer : You have plans this weekend? 
 Nothin' really. 
 No? 
 Jennifer : You should call Harry. 
 [phone chimes] 
 Jennifer? 
 You too? 
 What is this? 
 Our Relationship Disclosure form. 
 We f*cked once. 
 I've already informed Jordan. 
 Jordan knows about this? 
 Stop trying to make me jealous. 
 I'm not that girl anymore and nothing you do is gonna bring her back. 
 Holy sh1t. It worked. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [laughs] 
 Not bad. 
 Waze or unnecessary eye contact? 
 Ah, the Walter White joke. 
 Yeah, there was a... there was a fly in my office. 
 Little dated, but it plays. 
 Good pacing, though. Solid banter. 
 And no emojis. 
 You're off emojis? 
 They're so desperately cutesy. 
 Oh. 
 The girls I date don't complain. 
 You date children. 
 Oh, right. 
 Have you made plans with him? 
 Nope. Just playing it by ear. 
 You've come so far. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I have my phone back, please? 
 Laura : How's Harry? 
 Uh, I'm sure he's fine. 
 Who's Harry? 
 Some doctor my mom slept with. 
 Laura... 
 And this is... 
 Jack. They haven't slept together. 
 Okay. Thanks. That's enough. 
 Well, we should go anyway. 
 Thanks for breakfast. 
 Sure. 
 [sighs] 
 How about that? 
 What? 
 She made a friend. 
 [phone buzzes] 
 [light music] 
 I got to be honest with you, I'm a little confused here. 
 About what? 
 Your relationship with Fallon. 
 Millennials, right? 
 So quick to make it HR official. 
 Uh, you're a partner in this company. 
 Guy who started it all. 
 And you don't find this behavior at all... 
 I don't know... inappropriate? 
 I'm not following. 
 She's your subordinate. 
 And my assistant. 
 Come on, you can... you can understand why people might be concerned. 
 I think people who know me and Fallon will understand. 
 Mm. 
 So there's... there's nothing else behind this, then? 
 Just want us all to be happy.

 [chuckles] That's a fun word to say. 
 Fetching. 
 Hey, I was thinking, there's this restaurant I've been dying to try.

 Aw, that's... that's really nice. 
 Not necessarily. 
 My sister dated a plastic surgeon who sent her flowers and then two weeks later, he died. 
 Hi. [gasps] 
 Wow. Look at those. 
 Yeah. 
 Am I ungrateful? 
 Possibly. 
 Well, I haven't had the most discerning taste since Drew. 
 Harry is great. 
 He's stable and loyal and reliable. 
 Yeah, those are all good qualities. 
 But? 
 So, um, Jack came by the office. 
 For a session? 
 More like a date under the guise of a session. 
 Oh. 
 He always loves a grand gesture. 
 It was... charming. 
 Sure, it was. 
 But you know that he can sustain a relationship about as long as he can probably hold a boombox over his head. 
 Yeah, but everyone remembers the boombox. 
 He told you his near-plane-crash story? 
 Yeah, among other things. 
 Yeah. 
 But... 
 I'm not gonna tell you what to do. 
 I get it. 
 I just don't want to see you get hurt. 
 I mean, Harry is great, and I'm really grateful that you set me up with him. 
 You know, um, Harry's giving a lecture on autism tomorrow night. 
 We're all gonna go, take him out for drinks, celebrate him and his colleagues afterwards. 
 You should come. 
 Well, I don't want to intrude. 
 You wouldn't be. Not at all, trust me. 
 No, he would love it.

 Oh, look at that. 
 It's like a toboggan full of kimchi. 
 Mm. 
 Lot of Koreans in here, huh? 
 Yeah. That means it's authentic. 
 Korean to white ratio is very promising. 
 Yeah, just saying, lot of Koreans. 
 There's no need for that. 
 For what? 
 Whatever that was. 
 Racism? Is that what you're saying? 
 Because it's actually more racist to think that's racist. 
 Oh. How do you figure? 
 It's like how Americans think it's insulting to call Mexicans "Mexican." 
 As if it's an insult to actually be from Mexico. 
 It's just their ingrained sense of superiority shabbily masked behind political correctness that really highlights our latent racist views. 
 Maybe it was just your tone of voice. 
 Yeah, we should get some drinks. 
 Hey, can I get a whiskey? Neat. 
 Double, please.

 Can you name the happiest minute of your life? 
 Um, I don't know. My wedding day. 
 No. Too obvious. 
 Too obvious. Okay. 
 Um... 
 When Laura was a baby, she cried all the time, and we were living in this shithole apartment in Encino and... and it was... it was the kind of cry where you didn't think there was any possible way she could be okay, or that anything would ever be okay ever again. 
 And one morning, Drew took her out just to give me a break and... before I knew it, I... 
 I don't even know. 
 I don't think I knew what I was doing. 
 I had packed a bag and I got in the car and I just started driving north. 
 Wow.

 32 miles. 14 miles. 
 And you stopped? 
 Of course. I mean... 
 I told myself that everything would be okay if I could just make it to the soup. 
 How was it? 
 It was terrible. 
 No. [laughs] 
 It was just covered in toppings... bacon, cheddar, sour cream, it was... 
 Oh, f*ck. Like a baked potato? 
 Exactly. 
 It's like they spend 50 miles advertising this one f*cking thing and then you get there and it's like they're doing everything they can to try to cover it up.

 What'd you do? 
 Uh... 
 I ate the soup and then I turned the car around, drove home.
