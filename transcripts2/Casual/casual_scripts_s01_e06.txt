 Hm. 
 What are you looking at? 
 Comments about how I'm unlovable, and my website's a scam. 
 You can't just ignore me. 
 Actually, that's exactly what I'm doing. 
 Why aren't there any photos of you and me when I was a baby? 
 I think I'm going to give you and Valerie some space. 
 Where you gonna go? 
 Don't worry about me, dear. 
 We'll be talking. 
 Why are you still holding on? 
 Because then my mother will be right. 
 And if you keep the house, then... she'll be less right? 
 I'll look into appraisers this week, find out what it's worth.

 Do you think this about the divorce? 
 How? 
 I don't know, like, she feels like her tank is empty, or... there's a gaping hole in the side of her that needs to be filled. 
 A gaping hole inside her? 
 Stop it. 
 It'd look good in the kitchen. 
 I agree. 
 My breakfast nook looks out over the mountains, this would fit perfectly. 
 Mom, what are you doing here? 
 Laura invited me, and I love art. 
 You talked to her? 
 You flew back from Sedona? 
 She wanted me to come, and I never left. 
 You still seem a little tense, dear. 
 Maybe you should look into having another massage. 
 I don't understand, a Chevron? 
 Are we still talking about this? 
 Like, what was his big move? 
 Did he let you wash his windshields? 
 Stop, you're making me wet.

 Oh, hey. 
 Everything okay? 
 My mother's here. 
 Oh. 
 Actually, can you talk to me, so she doesn't? 
 Just about anything. 
 Um, do you know that game "Best/Worst?" 
 Explain it to me, very slowly. 
 [laughs] 
 Um, who's the best person you look like and who's the worst? 
 Like people have said that my best is Armie Hammer. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Who's your worst? 
 Buzz Lightyear. 
 Right. 
 [chuckles] 
 Um, so Laura, she's doing well. 
 Do you, do you really think so? 
 Yeah, with the year you guys are having, she's pretty resilient. 
 She is, isn't she? 
 How are things with her father? 
 Uh, we are fighting a war of attrition. 
 You know, whoever starts dating first usually gets the upper hand. 
 Does f*cking your mistress in our bed count as dating? 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, uh, uh, Katherine Keener or Julia Louis-Dreyfus. 
 Oh. Yes. 
 I will take it. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. Who's my worst? 
 I'll let you know.

 So... 
 What do you think of my piece? 
 It's a box, in the shape of a heart. 
 It's kinda like a heart-shaped box. 
 It's inspired by Nirvana, I know it's one of their lesser known tracks. 
 That was a #1 single. 
 Can I ask you something, bro to bro? 
 Excuse me? 
 Can you tell Laura that I didn't cheat on her? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Tell her yourself. 
 Please don't outbid me, she's my daughter. 
 And my granddaughter. 
 Mother, I am not doing this with you. 
 It's a shame Laura didn't feel comfortable asking Drew to come. 
 Is that what she told you? 
 I intuited. 
 She sees how callously you're treating him. 
 It's natural. 
 Children are very impressionable. 
 Mother, stop driving the price up. 
 Don't fight it. She always wins. 
 You ready to go? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Really, really proud of her and you guys should be too. 
 She's, uh, special considering... 
 I just want him to notice me. 
 Like really notice me. 
 I mean, we went out. 
 I thought it was a date, but... 
 I don't know, I guess I just thought something would have happened by now. 
 Maybe he's waiting for you to make a move. 
 I don't think that's it. 
 Are you sexually active? 
 I was. 
 A sexually active woman is a powerful force. 
 She exudes the scent. 
 The scent? 
 Pheromones. 
 The scent lets him know you're ready to engage. 
 Like a wolf. 
 But what if I don't have a scent? 
 You do. 
 You just need to meet another wolf to bring it out.

 Cause you're talking in your creepy high voice. 
 No, this is my motivated voice. 
 Is that the new dishwasher? 
 No, I didn't get it yet. 
 I had that ride to Santa Barbara on Sunday. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 It's just, we can't sell the house with the broken one. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 Did you get the garage motor? 
 I figured I would do that when I get the dishwasher. 
 Did you do anything that's on the realtor's list? 
 You don't have to micromanage me. 
 I'm not micromanaging you, because to do that, you would have had to have done something.

 Home Depot.

 I mean, I wanted Pinkberry, but there wasn't time to get both, and Fountain was terrible, with the street closures cause Biden's in town, and... 
 Are you having a mini stroke? 
 Just forget it. 
 Are you mad? 
 You're mad. 
 I said forget it. 
 Well because you decided to go to Starbucks? 
 Because I expect just a little bit of gratitude when I go out of my way for someone. 
 Well I said "Thanks". 
 And I didn't ask for Starbucks. 
 But I went anyway! 
 Jesus. Just get a f*cking Pinkberry next time. 
 Who's the worst person I look like? 
 Does it have to be an actual person? 
 How about an upside down mop? 
 You asked. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 I thought you were happy Mom left. 
 Maybe I'm not supposed to be happy. 
 What does that mean? 
 I don't know. 
 Like, I've done more bad than good, and the universe is punishing me. 
 What about all the good that you've done for me?

 Floor model, 200 bucks off. 
 Ok, but, you know, it was supposed to be the same as the one that we had.

 Well, sure, yeah I mean, there's... there's probably something comforting about a flat plate of nachos.

 Nachos for equality. 
 Exactly. 
 Flat nachos are great, but they're a fantasy. 
 I mean, life doesn't hand out toppings evenly. 
 If it did, everything would taste the same.
