 Previously on "Casual"... 
 I thought your sister didn't want us hanging out. 
 She didn't say that. Specifically. 
 I feel like I hardly even got to know him. 
 You had him for a day. 
 You don't belong here. 
 The desire for love is a powerful thing. 
 If you force him to choose, he may not choose you. 
 Well, she obviously does not want me here. 
 It's her first wedding since the divorce, and it's our parents, so she'll be better. 
 Yeah, or she'll get blackout drunk and cause a ridiculous scene. 
 Oh. We can only hope. 
 While most of us drift away from the one's we love, they came back together, and that's something worth celebrating. 
 That is MDMA. 
 That's happiness in 100 milligrams. 
 It's been so long. 
 Since you did ecstasy? 
 Since I was happy.

 We'll talk about it in the morning. 
 I love you.

 I was gonna make waffles, but... 
 Belgium can go f*ck itself. 
 Um... 
 Are you, uh... are you all right? 
 No, Leon. I don't think I am. 
 Well, we can... go to a strip club. 
 Those girls are sad enough.

 Alex! 
 You can't just waltz in here. 
 To my boyfriend's house? 
 You're not welcome here. 
 You are really gonna try to put this on me? 
 Well, your drugs, your lack of boundaries. 
 And you're selective memory. 
 I'm his sister. You're you. 
 Right. 
 I'm me. 
 When I first moved to this city, I came here all the time. 
 Just me and the birds. 
 There's no birds here. I don't see a single bird. 
 Yes, there are. 
 There... there are a few over there. 
 Anyway, uh, forget about the birds. 
 The point is... 
 I went a long time without... speaking to people. 
 Even in a place like this. All you have to do is... look down and they'll walk right past. 
 So, what changed? 
 I...I met my fiancé. 
 The one who cheated on you? With the VHS tapes? 
 You would have been better off with the birds. 
 Then I wouldn't have met your sister, and I wouldn't have let her take me home, and I wouldn't have gotten the chance to know you. 
 You don't know me, Leon. 
 Of... of course I do. 
 Where did I go to college? 
 What's me favorite movie? My favorite band? 
 I...get the sense you don't have a favorite movie or band. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm just the asshole who shows up when he needs something. 
 And you're too nice to tell me to leave.

 Just... come on.

 Who? 
 I don't remember his name, but he's black and he's British, and he...

 You. 
 Where's Carl? 
 sh1t. 
 You get off on coercing people into getting what you want? 
 Coercing? I didn't coerce him. 
 And I didn't coerce you. It was... it was just s*x. 
 Consensual s*x. 
 We didn't have s*x. 
 Okay. 
 We didn't. 
 Oh, no, no, no, I said okay. 
 We slept in the same bed. 
 We slept together, okay? We didn't sleep together. 
 What? We kissed. 
 Oh. Touched, fine. 
 We had, um... foreplay. 
 That's what it's called. We had foreplay. 
 But you came twice. 
 People come during foreplay. 
 Uh-huh. 
 It doesn't count, okay? 
 Nothing was, um... you know, inserted. 
 That's a very hetero-normative way of looking at it. 
 I know what it is! 
 How much do you actually remember? 
 I remember you taking advantage of me when I was very emotionally compromised. 
 You kissed me. 
 Wow. 
 I just got the weirdest sense of deja vu. 
 Laura... 
 So you guys had s*x at Dawn and Charles's wedding? 
 No, at rehearsal dinner. 
 Absolutely not. 
 So this is like a thing for you now? 
 I like someone, you f*ck him. 
 Alex likes someone, you f*ck her. 
 No. 
 You just can't help yourself, can you? 
 You just have to f*ck everyone for yourself. 
 [scoffs] I feel sorry for you. 
 Laura, this was... a mistake. 
 This was a... this was a very, very big mistake. 
 You f*ck her by mistake? Really, like an accident? 
 You're a therapist. 
 Do you even believe in accidental f*cks? 
 Can you stop saying f*ck? 
 I don't even know why I came back here.

 Or like a farm? Maybe he's a sheepdog now. 
 That's the highest class of dog, you know? 
 Mm. Canine nobility. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Do you think he's happy? 
 I hope he's happy. I do. 
 But then the selfish part of me kind of hopes he's in this really dirty puppy gulag, and we have to break in and rescue him. 
 Well, we'll do whatever it takes. 
 Yeah, we will. 
 Take a right. 
 Ah, it should be right up here.

 I'm a bad person, aren't I? 
 I mean, yeah, I'm a bad person. 
 Good people don't... [scoffs] 
 Good people do not do what I did. 
 You did a bad thing, but that doesn't make you a bad person... necessarily. 
 He's got this online profile, and she is the only one who matched it, the only one. 
 I know that sounds really f*cking stupid, but... it was him, I mean, it was like the real Alex. 
 The real Alex. It sounded like him. 
 He was so happy. 
 Oh, so happy... and I ruined it. 
 Do you not want him to be happy? 
 Of course I want him to be happy.
