 [exhales] Man, sorry, I was so rough. 
 I ate vegetables the other day that really amped me up. 
 Devin brought home this like green leafy thing, and I was just like, "Uh-huh, never again." 
 That's the great thing about being an adult. 
 You can do whatever you want. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 If you come over tomorrow, can you bring some ketchup? 
 Mwah. 
 No, sorry. 
 Devin and I are throwing this like '90's party. 
 Everyone's coming as like a '90's character. 
 Veronica's gonna be Rachel from "Friends." 
 Mm, maybe I'll come by or whatever. 
 Did you just say you wanted to come? 
 Yeah. It sounds dope. 
 Oh, wow, really? 
 Cool. Oh, that's really cool. [laughs] 
 I guess I could just, you know, text you my address or like whatever. 
 Now is it cool if I like don't wear a costume? 
 I mean, everyone else will be wearing one... 
 Thanks, babe.

 Ooh, check out this cute guy I matched with on Tinder. 
 Let me see. 
 Eeeeeh, uh, no, no, no way. 
 Why not? 
 I mean, look, it says he's a 29-year-old promoter who likes snowboarding. 
 Yeah, so? 
 Yeah, well, on Tinder, 29 means 40. 
 Promoter means unemployed. 
 And snowboarder? 
 That means he's gonna try to put in your butt. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because I once had a snowboarder say, "Yo, what up, girl?" 
 And, see, just slide right on in. 
 I just got off the phone with my therapist, Dr. Sheila. 
 Hi, Devin. 
 Hi. 
 Shut up. I have to do this. 
 Nicole, you owe me $150 for the electric bill. 
 And I've asked you four times. 
 I need you to pay me. 
 Oh no, how'd that happen? 
 That's a lot. 
 Listen, I got you tomorrow, Boo-boo. 
 Come on, we should... No, Nicole. 
 Not today, you've been telling me, "Oh, I'll get you tomorrow," for over 300 days. 
 And it's starting to make me feel less than. 
 Okay, all right, Devin. 
 I just gotta say, this new confrontational you is so powerful and skinny. 
 No, not today, Nicole. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, your waist so small. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You're right, I feel it. 
 It's like a little straw. 
 Ooh, suck me up, I'm so tiny. 
 [in baby voice] Oh my goodness, you so tiny. 
 Oh no, where do you go? 
 Devin : I could just slip into a crack. 
 Oh, you just went through a crack. 
 Ooh, where did I go? 
 Where am I? 
 No, no, Devin, don't fall for this. 
 If anything, you're getting bigger. 
 You're getting like lady hips. 
 My dad was very hippy, okay? 
 Nicole, I need that 150. 
 I can't keep covering for you. 
 I don't have any money. 
 I literally have five dollars to my name. 
 Didn't you just spend like $1,200 on a wig at Ebony Crowns last week? 
 Yes! 
 That's why I don't have any money. 
 But I will pay you back. 
 Listen, this is all a part of the journey. 
 We're all out here in these streets struggling for my dream. 
 Fine. 
 I guess I'll cover for you yet again. 
 Thank you. 
 Honestly, this has been a very stressful morning for me. 
 And I think I have more than earned some fro-yo. 
 You did. 
 I'm gonna get an [unintelligible]. 
 Oh, dang, girl, get them berries. 
 Bye. 
 Nicole : Bye. 
 Man, I was really looking forward to going to my first African hair salon. 
 Oh, no, we are going. 
 I'm getting my hair braided. 
 I'm going as Janet Jackson from "Poetic Justice." 
 Yeah, but you don't have any money. 
 I have hair-braiding money. 
 I don't have bill-paying money. 
 This isn't complicated. 
 Didn't you go to college? 
 Yeah, but we didn't study nonsense economics. 
 Hey now. 
 [phone dings] 
 Oh, yeah. 
 He asked if I would put it in my butt. 
 You should do it. 
 Listen, Oprah says, "You gotta open yourself to new experiences." 
 I know she wasn't specifically talking about buttholes, but like... get in there. 
 Again, from the top. 
 Welcome to the Hollywood Shame Bus. 
 I'm your guide, Chace. 
 To your left, you'll see the lot where a bald Britney Spears attacked her car with an umbrella. 
 Okay. We're getting somewhere, I guess. Yeah. 
 Imagine you're one of our clients, Chace. 
 You're from some Midwestern hellhole. 
 Where are you from again? 
 Royal Okay, Michigan. 
 Yes, that's perfect. 
 That hellhole. 
 Okay, so you're on this bus. 
 This is your one chance to feel better than a rich celebrity who got caught slippin'. 
 This is very important work, Chace. 
 Wow, that's so deep. 
 And very seasoned. 
 What's the name of the hooker Hugh Grant picked up? 
 Dawn Brown? 
 [sighs] It's Divine Brown, you maroon. 
 And I honestly don't have the time or the energy to deal with you right now. 
 Are you okay? 
 No, I'm not! 
 I'm planning a '90's party all by myself. 
 And my plantar fasciitis is flaring up! 
 Wow, your life is like a movie. 
 Think I could come to your party? 
 I don't know many people in L.A. yet, and this could be like a great opportunity... 
 Ssssh, stop, no. 
 You know Professional Devin. 
 You're not ready to meet Party Devin. 
 It's too much. 
 That's too much for you. 
 Honestly, sometimes, it's too much for me. 
 So I can't come? 
 It's probably best that you don't. 
 Hollywood Shame Bus. 
 See? 
 Very seasoned. 
 That was amazing. 
 Derrick's coming to the party? 
 Dressed as what? 
 A short text message? 
 Be happy for me.

 Is this it? 
 One hundred perfect human hair. 
 Where do they get it? 
 We don't ask. 
 Oh. 
 All right, so when we get in there, you watch, no talking. 
 Why? 
 Because this isn't the kind of place that puts the prices on the wall. 
 They charge you based on how much money they think you have, which is why I try to look as poor as possible to get a good deal. 
 But you are poor. 
 Yeah, but I don't present as poor. 
 Hold this. 
 Okay, you're not gonna be proud of what happens next. 
 I know I'm setting my people back. 
 Just know it kills me inside, but it is necessary. 
 Okay.

 Oooh, yes. 
 Devin : That little bitch. 
 Hey, I think you're ready to handle the tour on your own. 
 What? 
 Yeah, I'm throwing the baby into the deep end. 
 It's the best way to learn.

 You are all right, sista? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. 
 Just give us a second. That's my baby daddy.

 Outside of here, it's 100% for sure not okay. 
 Okay. 
 Man, you're gonna be the perfect "Poetic Justice," and I'm gonna look like crap. 
 Why? 
 Well, I tried on my Rachel wig, and all my hair stuffed underneath makes this like weird lump. 
 The Rachel from "Friends"? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Ah, the sister can do for you. 
 No, I don't wanna cut my hair. 
 It took me like two months to grow out. 
 Simple. We can do without cutting your hair. 
 Black hair magic is real. 
 Come, I give you for 100. 
 Fifty.

 A hundred, yes, I'm so sorry. 
 Yes, a hundred, let's do it. 
 Um, what are you doing here, Chace? 
 I punched you out, nobody noticed. 
 I thought you'd wanna know.

 No, that's stupid, of course there's not.

 How?

 No! 
 You stay where you are. 
 Devin, you tell me which wig you took and where you took it? 
 Well, it wasn't Rhi-yonce, if that's what you're worried about, because I'm not a monster. 
 It was Sea-lange.

 But it's clearly honey brown, because I dyed it. 
 I would like my wig back. 
 That's not your wig. 
 It's a brand-new wig from New Zealand. 
 Okay, if you could just take it out of the case, I can show you where I wrote my name on the tag. 
 I will take it out of the case if you buy it. 
 Fine. I'll call the police.

 Veronica, everybody knows you can't negotiate with a wig lady.

 Thank you.

 Okay, is this glass reinforced? 
 Because in my head, I thought I was lady who would jump over a counter. 
 But now that I'm trying to do it, I don't think that I am. You know what? 
 Mmm. 
 I'm gonna leave here with some dignity. 
 You don't by any chance have like a men's toupee that could...

 Come on, napkins in a pile, Chace? 
 Unbelievable. 
 Look, you wanna fan them out, okay? 
 Whoo. 
 This is Van Nuys, not Panorama City. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 It's okay. Just go set up Cranium. 
 Mm. Let me guess. 
 They didn't give you your wig back. 
 No, but it was my fault. 
 Look, I'm just happy you realized what I did was very harsh but also very necessary. 
 I see that now. 
 My actions have consequences. 
 I've been irresponsible. 
 And I've taken advantage of our friendship. 
 I welcome you back into my life. 
 Oh. [laughing] 
 Mm. 
 Mm. 
 Man, I was really hoping this was gonna destroy your relationship. 
 Veronica? 
 Veronica : I was.

 Yeah, we could use some more ice. 
 Do you want some money? 
 No, Veronica will pay. 
 What? 
 You're the one with a job. 
 Ooh, can I borrow your car? My trunk won't open. 
 Devin : Oh, yeah. 
 Here you go. 
 Nicole : And here you go.

 Yes, God! 
 Sorry. Just usually when you say baby, you're talking about your vibrator.

 Done. 
 Okay. I guess that's perfect. 
 Now go rub yourself down with some canola oil before the party starts. 
 We're back. 
 S-s-s-she's back! 
 Where did you get that? 
 I sold your car. 
 Veronica : But we also got ice. 
 I should have known that no amount of punishing you would have ever helped. 
 You're toxic. 
 I'm toxic? 
 You sold one of my wigs. 
 You know how much they mean to me. 
 That's like basically selling one of my kids. 
 I had to pay the electric bill. 
 Somebody here needs to be responsible. 
 Oh, we were fine. 
 They give you like three warnings before they shut it off. 
 Okay. You know what? I'm done. 
 You're done? I'm done. 
 This whole roommate thing, it's not working out. 
 I just let you move in, 'cause I felt bad for you. 
 Oh, you felt bad for me? 
 I felt bad for you. 
 Oooh. 
 You felt bad for me? 
 Well, fine, move out! 
 I got my wig back. 
 Here's the rest of your money. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Oh my God. 
 This is like a thousand bones. 
 My car was only worth like $478. 
 How did you do this? 
 I mean, once you've negotiated with Senegalese braiders, old white men are cake. 
 This is enough money for me to lease that Hyundai Sonata. 
 You beautiful psychopath. 
 Mm, I can't live without you, my beautiful mess of a human being. 
 Both : Ahh! 
 Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah. 
 Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.
