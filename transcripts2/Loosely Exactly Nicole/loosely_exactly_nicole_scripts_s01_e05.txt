 [phone ringing] 
 Oh God, who the hell's calling me at... oooh... 10 a.m...? 
 Uhhh. 
 Uh, hi, Avi, is that you? 
 How's my favorite client? 
 Am I really your favorite client? 
 Sure. 
 Anyway, I have good news. 
 [gasps] I booked that restless leg thing. 
 No, Jenny Stein got that one. 
 You booked a national commercial for Swedish Slumber Pillows. 
 Yes! I'm going to Sweden! 
 No, they're shooting it on a soundstage. 
 Yes, I'm going to a soundstage. 
 I just wanted to give you a heads up about the director. 
 Her name's Nora McNab. 
 She's great. 
 She's done a bunch of commercials, a few features. 
 You're gonna love her. 
 There's just a few things. 
 Ooh, what things? 
 Nothing huge. 
 Just follow her rules. 
 She's big-time. 
 She directed "Resurrection Day." 
 I love that movie. 
 Liam Neeson's all like, "What it's gonna take for you understand that my daughter belongs to me?" 
 And then he jumps out of that window to save her when she falls out of that helicopter. 
 Uh, classic Liam Neeson. 
 Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 So, yeah, just follow her orders, and you'll be $6,000 richer in four days. 
 Six thousand dollars! 
 Oh my God, oh my God! 
 What do rich people do with $6,000? 
 Save it. 
 I'm gonna buy shoes! 
 Okay, but after taxes and my commission, it's really not $6,000. 
 Lots of 'em. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm an actress. 
 ♪ 
 Ooh, thank you. 
 Is this for free? 
 Yes. 
 Excuse me. 
 What is this? 
 Uh, it's a call sheet. 
 And that is? 
 It's a sheet of paper that lists everyone's names, jobs, what we're shooting today. 
 Okay. 
 Let me guess, you're Mohammed? 
 [laughs] 
 No, he's our key grip. 
 I'm Danny. 
 See, I'm right here under boom operator. 
 Ah. 
 What is a boom operator? 
 I hold the microphone while we shoot. 
 [laughs] I knew that. 
 I didn't think you worked in explosives. 
 I mean, that would be... that would be crazy. 
 Um, I don't see my name on here. 
 You're Nicole, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So you have your own little section right here under talent. 
 I'll see you on set. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Oh my God, every single person here knows I am talented. [laughs] 
 Is that Nicole Byer? 
 Nora McNab, director. 
 Glad to have you. 
 I'm so happy to be... 
 This is gonna be a fun four days. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Have some melon. 
 It's fantastic, good for the eyelashes. 
 Okay. 
 Did you know 400 people auditioned for this commercial? 
 Oh, really? 
 Welcome to the majors. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, hair and makeup is outside in that trailer. 
 Meet you in 20 on the set. 
 Okay. Twenty.

 Oh.

 When you lay your head down on a Swedish Slumber Pillow, you can count on a visit from me! 
 And cut! 
 [bell rings] 
 That's a wrap on day one. 
 Big hand for Nicole, everybody! 
 [applause] 
 Ooh, stop! 
 Stop it. 
 Also, is someone recording this? 
 If so, can you please send it to me? 
 You crushed it today. 
 Oh, really? 
 How many actresses have you worked with? 
 Probably like a couple of hundred. 
 Oooh, am I the best? 
 Uh, top five, for sure. 
 But like top of the five, right? 
 Yeah, but you're gonna have to tell Demi Lovato she's number two. 
 I don't know who that is. 
 Mm. 
 Wait until I leave to read this. 
 Also, don't read it out loud. 
 It's very sexual in nature. 
 [laughs] Bye. 
 "Dear Danny, I know we've only just met. But I could feel a strong connection growing between us... as two people who work together, but also in a sexual nature. Since you pointed out my name on the call sheet, mm, I can't stop thinking about you. And how when we were shooting, people would yell at you, 'Boom in the frame!' Because I want you to get your boom in my frame. Okay, so if you feel the same way, check the box below that says I like you and return it to me tomorrow, or just talk to me. Whatever's easier. Sincerely, Nicole." 
 [laughs] 
 Crazy. 
 Hi, hi, hi. 
 Hey, how was your first day? 
 Ooh, so good. 
 Devin, I talked to the director. 
 And she said I can't have an assistant, even if he works for free. 
 [sighs] 
 But I'm not gonna give up. 
 I made a very valuable discovery. 
 I think you should have a seat. 
 Okay. Well, let me get some wine. 
 Nope. 
 But let me get a glass. 
 Okay. 
 So, I was doing my normal Internet perusing, pipping to that site, popping to this site. 
 And I pipped across this. 
 [laughs] What? Bone Bus? 
 You just discovered that? 
 No, I've known about Bone Bus since I was 13, okay? 
 It's Raymond. 
 Raymond as in Veronica's boyfriend Raymond. 
 I know who Raymond is! 
 Oh my God, who's the girl? 
 Becca Boston. 
 Nicole : No way. 
 Devin : Mm-hmm. 
 That must have been before the implants. 
 Yeah, They're so, so small. 
 They're very small. 
 I feel like mine are bigger than hers. 
 Yeah, yours are definitely bigger than hers. 
 What about mine? 
 Definitely bigger. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Definitely bigger. 
 Anyways, I've been dying to watch this. 
 Shall we get to business? 
 Yes. 
 ♪ 
 That was... 
 Let us never speak of this again. 
 Oh. 
 Devin : Where are you going? 
 I gotta tell Veronica. 
 She's gotta know. 
 It's too much to text. 
 Wait... would you take a picture of her face when you tell her? 
 Maybe. 
 Don't drink my wine. 
 [knocking at door] 
 Uh, I was dead asleep. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This is just too important. 
 Where's your laptop? 
 What's going on? 
 Raymond is in a p0rn. 
 Raymond is not in a p0rn. 
 Check it out. 
 Veronica : Oh my God, that's him. 
 Nicole : Yeah, it sure is. 
 I can't watch this. 
 Nicole : Yeah, but... 
 No, I said I'm not watching it. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, can we just drop this? 
 Let's just not talk about this. 
 But I know... 
 Look, Nicole, I'm trying to be the cool girlfriend who doesn't care about his past, okay? 
 I haven't asked about his ex-girlfriends or when he lost his virginity, because I'm cool with that stuff. 
 Are you? 
 I'm cool! 
 With everything! 
 Besides, we all do dumb things when we're younger. 
 Oooh, yeah. 
 Like when you hooked up with that guy Aaron. 
 When he [bleep], he was just like, "Ooooooh, booooy!" 
 Yeah, that was a stupid thing that I did. 
 That's a stupid thing that Raymond did. 
 Doesn't change who he is now. 
 Listen, I just think you need to see the end of it. 
 No, Nicole, please don't bring this up again. 
 I'm just gonna leave you my password just in case you change your mind. 
 [sighs] Veronica! 
 You can use that password for all of the p0rn on that site.

 Director : And cut!

 Do you wanna go to George's Taco? 
 I went a while ago, it was pretty good. 
 You went and you didn't tell me? 
 It was before we started going out. 
 Yeah, but why wouldn't you tell me? 
 Did you not think I'd be cool with it? 
 Do you ever see me as someone who's not cool with that? 
 No.
