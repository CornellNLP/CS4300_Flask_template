 [continuous honk] 
 [phone buzzes] 
 Ohh. Ohh. 
 Ohh! 
 [honking stops] 
 Off. 
 [phone buzzing continues] 
 Uhh! 
 [buzz] 
 [beep] 
 Otto. 
 Otto. 
 Audrey. Thank God. 
 Are you all right? 
 No. 
 I'm in trouble. 
 [speaking Asian language] 
 What? 
 This employment agency. 
 What job you looking for? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't understand what you're saying. 
 Ha ha ha ha. I'm f*cking with you, man. 
 [speaking Asian language] 
 [speaking Asian language] 
 Wow. Heh. You... 
 You really like to cut it close, don't you? 
 I assume you have something for me. 
 Jesus Christ, what happened to you? 
 You look like sh1t. 
 It's all there. 
 Oh, I don't doubt it's all there. 
 Richie. 
 Yeah, Richie, grab the money. 
 So tell me, Marius... what's it feel like, right now, seeing her again? 
 Is that why you brought her here? 
 To rub it in? 
 Yeah. 
 No. 
 Well, maybe a little. 
 Because if you don't mind, I'd like to get Eddie and get the f*ck out of here, all right? 
 Yeah, well, about that, listen. 
 About what? About... About what? 
 About nothing. 
 Eddie is free to come and go as he pleases. 
 I'm a man of my word. 
 You, however, is a different story. 
 Look, I need to keep you here until Winslow shows up. 
 So that's it? 
 I'm dead? 
 There's no Door Number 2? 
 What do you think? 
 Hmm. 
 Do you want to tell him my idea? 
 Sure. 
 Tell him. 
 Vince has a big player who's cheating. 
 And what does that have to do with me? 
 Well, he can't spot it, and he thinks you can. 
 So kick him out of your game. 
 Can't do that unless I catch him in the act. 
 So play him yourself. 
 He already did. 
 And he beat you? 
 Yeah. 
 He beat me 'cause he cheats. 
 Do you get the point? 
 Yeah. 
 So what do you want to do, huh? 
 You in, or you out? 
 What's in it for me? 
 What's in it for you? 
 How about this? 
 I tell Winslow to stand down so that you can keep on breathing. 
 How about that? 
 So you just want to catch him cheating, or do you want to take him down?

 Ah, Mr. Joseph. 
 Karolina, look at you, girl. 
 You've put on a little weight, a little heft there. 
 I don't think so. 
 Yeah, you did. It looks good. 
 These New York girls are too skinny. 
 Come here, girl. Mm. Mm. Yes. 
 Who is this gentleman? 
 That's, uh, Marty Joseph. 
 He's a card dealer from Ohio. 
 Vinnie. 
 Hey. 
 How you doing, buddy? 
 Marty Joseph. Long time. 
 Yeah, I've been playing out on the Left Coast. 
 I'm not too crazy about their politics, but I like the color of their money. 
 Last month I took 10 grand off of Matt Damon. 
 I kicked Jason Bourne's ass. 
 [laughing] 
 Funny. 
 [laughing] 
 I don't believe I've had the pleasure. 
 Marty Joseph, this is Raj Kumar Mukherjee. 
 Ah, I know that name. 
 Yeah, I hear you're a real hitter. 
 And I understand you sell cars. 
 Well, if you call 10,000 units of E selling cars, then sure. 
 Mind if I, uh, join in? 
 I have no objection. 
 Vince : Good. 
 Who's the dealer? 
 Eddie. 
 How you doing? 
 All right. 
 Good. 
 [grunting] 
 How deep? 
 Deep enough for one, maybe two bodies. 
 Dig. 
 Otto : We gone past it? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 We must have. Turn it around. 
 For God... Oh, sh... 
 Jesus! 
 Audrey! 
 Audrey! 
 Oh, thank Jesus. 
 You're alive. 
 Oh! 
 Why did you bring Taylor? 
 I didn't give him a choice. 
 You have to get out of here. 
 Grandma. 
 You have to get out of here! 
 Just tell me what happened. 
 Taylor! 
 Tell me what happened. 
 Taylor! 
 She's right! You can't be a part of this! 
 I already am! 
 Ohh! 
 I already am. 
 To you. 
 Those in play. 
 I cut. 
 To you. 
 Mm, call. 
 Here's 5,000. 
 45 to you. 
 Why not? Call. 
 Fold. 
 Folds. 
 Costs 10 to play. 
 Call. 
 That's good. 
 What is that? 
 A Rolex. 
 That's nice. 
 I know. 
 Sir, it's to you. 
 Check to the raise. 
 Check. Raise 5,000. 
 Kings or aces. Kings or aces. 
 I'll raise you... 5,000. 
 [sniff] 
 So I do this... [sniff]. 
 That means I'm talking to you. 
 You look at my hand. 
 My left pinkie means Mukherjee is palming. 
 My left ring finger means he's daubing, which is marking. 
 I know what daubing is. 
 Okay. My left thumb is, uh, fold. 
 I'm out. 
 Folds. 
 Mr. Mukherjee. 
 All in. 
 Call. 
 Gentlemen, show your cards. 
 Go over. 
 Ace king, suited. 
 [whistle] 
 Set of 9s. 
 Flush gets it. 
 Ha ha. 
 Oh! Not flush! 
 Oh! 
 Flush takes it. 
 I... I thought that was a high pair. 
 Sorry to disappoint you. 
 Ah, it's better to be disappointed in cards than in love. 
 I am seldom disappointed in either. 
 What? 
 Surprise. 
 Jesus, Julia, what are you doing here? 
 Hello, Chayton. 
 Used to come here with Audrey when you were younger. 
 Still remembered how to get here. 
 I want to talk. 
 Unless you have my money, there's nothing to talk about. 
 We can talk about the money later. 
 I'm here to talk about this one. 
 Julia... 
 Shut up. 
 He's no use to you. 
 I'd argue he's no use to anybody, but he's still the father of my son, so... 
 I need him alive. 
 Well, if he'd stayed out of it, my money would still be in that safe. 
 He didn't take the money out of the safe. Audrey did. 
 This is between our two families. 
 Julia, there's a door behind you. Run. 
 Lance, put that f*cking thing down... 
 Go! 
 ... or I'll punch you in the dick. 
 Put it down. 
 Okay, there's a real simple way out of this. 
 Not now. 
 The farm's worth a lot of money. 
 They just found out it's sitting on top of a massive uranium deposit. 
 Lance, you idiot, there's no uranium. 
 Yes, there is. I took a Geiger counter out there... 
 We conned you! 
 Pete, his mother, the old man... it was all a con to get the money back. 
 The farm's not worth sh1t. 
 Now beat it. I need to talk to Chayton. 
 So talk. 
 Audrey : He slammed on the brakes and grabbed my arm to take the gun. 
 That's all I remember. 
 When you woke up, you still had the gun in your hand. 
 Yeah. 
 How could Pete just have left you here? 
 How can he have taken that money that we needed... 
 Forget about the money, Otto. 
 We have a dead cop here, and I was holding the gun. 
 You understand what that means? 
 I got a guy killed today, too. 
 You what? 
 [gunshot] 
 Oh! 
 He was a dirty cop. 
 I had a falling out with the guy who was paying him. 
 They drove him off the road, put two in his chest, one in his head, like the pros do. 
 What about the tire tracks? 
 We'll just have to hope that CSI's as shitty out here as it is in Bridgeport. 
 Yeah. No, no, no. That s... 
 That sounds right. 
 Okay. Uh, I owe you, Lenny. 
 Time to sleep. 
 Word is Winslow was moonlighting, doing dirty work for an old buddy... retired NYPD hard-ass named Vince Lonigan. 
 Vince? 
 Yeah. 
 When we were at Pinetop, Pete was scared shitless of some guy named Vince. 
 Well, Lenny says this guy has a... has a poker room in the city, in Chinatown. 
 You get an address? 
 Let's go. 
 So that's it? 
 Yes. 
 What did you guys talk about? 
 None of your f*cking business. 
 20,000. 
 Raise to 40,000. 
 I'm out. 
 Folds.

 You need a tissue? 
 It's your action, boss. 
 Put the deck on the table. 
 Take your hands away from your cards. 
 Call. 
 Nobody touches the cards. 
 Nobody. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, with my apologies... 
 I need to ask you to leave at this time. 
 Dennis, Richie, would you escort everybody out who's not at this table? 
 Wally, you can stay and Karolina, of course. 
 [clapping hands] All right, come on, folks. 
 You heard the man. It's time to get out of here. 
 You got to go home or, you know. 
 Come on. Put a fire under it. 
 Let's go. 
 [murmuring] 
 Hey, I left my, uh... 
 Get the f*ck out, Tate. 
 Get out. 
 You, too. 
 Vince, what are you doing? 
 How long... did you think I would ride that? 
 Ride what? 
 Marius, did you really think I wouldn't snap to a play like this? 
 Giving me the "all in" signal at that very moment? 
 Wait. He signaled you? 
 Were you cheating me? 
 No, you miserable prick. 
 You were cheating me... you and Marius and Eddie... and you. 
 Vince, I... I swear I... 
 Just don't. Just sit down. 
 Sit down. 
 My friend, whatever you think I've done, you're mistaken. 
 I'm not your f*cking friend. 
 And we'll find out if I'm mistaken, right? 
 My guess is that... your pockets are pretty strong. 
 Shall we take a look at what you got? Hmm? 
 Keep your hands away from the cards. 
 Jacks. 
 Jacks and 10s. Nice hand. 
 But I've got queens and 10s, and I'm on a flush draw, so right now I'm feeling pretty good. 
 I'm about to take you down for a lot of money. 
 Huh? And just then I get the "all in" signal from Marius, and I'm just about to do it. 
 And then... everything just... slows down for me. 
 You ever get that feeling where you think you've been here before? 
 You know, déjÃ  vu, where everything you said and did... everything was like before? 
 The hairs on the back of your neck stand up, but you can't quite put your finger on where or when. 
 But for me, right now, I can. 
 I remember exactly where I was and when it was... and who I was with. 
 Isn't that right, Marius? 
 Vince. 
 Yeah. A little over three years ago. 
 Oh, the room was different, and the whale was different. 
 But it was the same young lady... leading me to my doom. 
 Baby, that isn't true. 
 No, I know. That was the reaction that I had, too, at first. 
 I thought, No, this can't be because I've given her everything... food and clothing, shelter. 
 And I shared with her my most intimate thoughts. 
 This girl... uh, really cares for me, maybe even loves me. 
 So no. 
 It can't be. She wouldn't... wouldn't do this to me. 
 But then... then I just... I just... 
 [sigh]... run it back through my mind. 
 Right? 
 And I realize... that all this week... you were guiding me to this moment. 
 No. 
 No. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Ever so gently, but you were. 
 You've been leading me right here... where I play in my own game in my own poker room. 
 And once again... 
 I find my fate in the hands of Marius. 
 All the elements of a classic con. 
 Eddie's the mechanic. 
 Mukherjee's the whale. 
 Marius, the captain, and you, sweetheart... you're the rope. 
 [gasping] 
 Vince. 
 And I have the mark. 
 Vince. 
 Vince! 
 Vince! 
 [coughing] 
 Ohh! 
 I would love to be wrong. 
 [cough] 
 But I don't think that I am. 
 There's one way to find out for sure. 
 So... 
 I had this game. 
 It's mine... tight. 
 [Karolina gasping] 
 You had no chance of winning this hand, no chance... well, one. 
 You had one chance, one out the jack of spades. 
 What's it, about 2%, Eddie? 
 That's it. 
 So if this next card's a jack of spades, you all were trying to f*ck me. 
 Why don't you tell me what it is, honey? 
 Hmm? 
 If I'd have listened to you, Marius, I'd have lost all my money, hmm? 
 But of course that was the plan, wasn't it? 
 Feeding me the cards. Wasn't it? 
 Hmm? 
 What I want from you now is to finally drop the con and admit... that I f*cking got you. 
 Maybe this will help. 
 [whimper] 
 You got three seconds before I put a bullet in your f*cking head. 
 1, 2... 
 Don't... Don't... Don't... 
 Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, okay? 
 I'll tell you. Okay, yes. 
 Yeah, everything... everything you said was right. 
 Okay? Karolina told me that Marius and her were working again, and they hired this guy right here to be the whale. 
 This isn't true. He's lying. 
 Shut up! 
 Richie, find his phone on him. 
 [beep] 
 All right, what's your password, asshole? 
 B-O-L-L-Y... 
 924. 
 Bolly? 
 f*ck me. 
 Let's go to recent calls, shall we? 
 Uh... uh... you got a call from someone with the initials M.J. 
 Who do you think that could be? 
 Hmm? 
 We should try it. 
 [beep] 
 [phone rings] 
 [ring] 
 Marius, aren't you going to pick that up? 
 [ring] 
 Might be important. 
 [ring] 
 Hmm? 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 [ring... beep off] 
 
 
 
 Well? 
 What's there left to say, huh, Marius? 
 I'm tired. 
 Of course you are. 
 I should have killed you three years ago. 
 All of you. 
 Would have made my life a lot easier. 
 Well, you live and learn. 
 [whisper] I'm going to kill you last so you can watch your brother die. 
 But first, I'm going to deal with that asshole. 
 Oh, I've been waiting to put a bullet in your f*cking head for a long time. 
 Vince, I swear to God. 
 I don't... I swear... 
 Put the gun down! 
 Hey! I'm... I'm FBI. 
 Okay? This man is a federal witness under my protection. 
 I just sent a distress code to the FBI field office. 
 f*ck me. My head is spinning right now. 
 Marius, is this... is this part of the plan, or are you just making this sh1t up as you go along? 
 Call the FBI... special agent in charge Michael Dumbrovski. 
 He'll confirm everything I'm telling you. 
 My God, you're good. 
 You're the fixer, right? Of course. 
 You never drop the con, even when you're blown. 
 You're a pro. 
 [all shouting] 
 Vince, I swear... 
 Mukherjee... 
 Please... 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 Please don't! Please! 
 Hey! 
 Drop to the ground! 
 We... We... 
 Now! Do it! 
 We're just licensed bodyguards. 
 All right. G-Gun on the floor. 
 Unarmed. 
 [grunting] 
 [police sirens in distance] 
 It's over. 
 Let's go. Let's go! 
 Took you long enough. 
 Let's go! 
 [sirens blaring] 
 Let's go, go, go, go! 
 Are we good? 
 Yeah, we're good. 
 How the f*ck are we good? 
 Vince caught on to us before we even got started. 
 "Good." f*ck, is it me? Did I f*ck up? 
 Eddie. Eddie, I got a confession to make. 
 What? 
 We didn't tell you everything. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Mukherjee wasn't somebody that we hired, okay? 
 He didn't even know he was part of it. 
 Who the f*ck is he? 
 He's a tech billionaire from Mumbai. 
 What? 
 We needed a handle, someone who'd get under Vince's skin. 
 We had an inside guy scout the players. 
 Tate. 
 Tate's job was to get into Vince's room and find the handle. 
 Mukherjee was more than worth the wait. 
 The real kicker was Joseph discovering that Mukherjee was a federal informant and his bodyguard is FBI. 
 [siren] 
 [police radio chatter] 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Otto : It's too late. 
 The money's gone. 
 I'll take you home. 
 You're late. 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
 I thought maybe you got somebody else killed. 
 Took the long way in case we were followed. 
 Come on. We got to keep moving. 
 Where's our nurse? 
 He's not a nurse, and he couldn't go until we left. 
 Wait a second. Wait. 
 If Mukherjee wasn't involved, Marius, how the f*ck did he have your number? 
 Uh, that was me. 
 I didn't have time to set up anything fancy. 
 So the fool got an idea he had a shot at Karolina. 
 Wasn't thinking about anything else. 
 So I got the smack pit out without having to kiss the dog. 
 Handed her off to Joseph, and before I had time to wash my hands, it was done. 
 The phone was back in Mukherjee's pocket before he knew it was gone. 
 [chuckling] 
 What if Vince shot him? 
 You ever think about that? 
 Of course we thought about that. 
 Look, whenever there's a threat against a federal witness, the FBI takes special precautions for several days, so I've been calling in anonymous tips for the past six months, the last one just a couple days ago. 
 [whisper] Face the entrance. 
 And last night I checked them both for their vests and Wally for his ankle gun. 
 And if anything was missing, I was going to pull the plug. 
 Are you kidding me? That was a huge f*cking risk. 
 Yeah. There's always a risk. 
 Yeah, but it didn't work. 
 Vince shot a federal agent in the chest. 
 He's going to do what, 20 years? It worked. 
 Yeah, but the money. 
 This wasn't about money, Eddie. 
 This was about Charlie. 
 For all the fucked-up things I've done in my life, whoo! That takes the cake. 
 Nurse is here. 
 Marjorie : He's not a nurse. 
 I'm not lying. This was about revenge. 
 Ah. But revenge... revenge is so much sweeter with this. 
 Wow. 
 It was a barometric safe. 
 I know. They're a bitch. 
 Looked into freezing it with liquid nitrogen. 
 I looked into drilling and filling it with water, doing a concussion. 
 Ah, I had a hard time finding this place. 
 You need to go down and show everyone how to get up here. 
 Come on. I got this. 
 I even went down a crazy DARPA rabbit hole of the haptic gloves with the fingerprint interface. 
 But in the end, I realized I didn't have to crack the safe. 
 I just had to crack Vince. 
 Aah! 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Who's handling Joseph's cut? 
 Uh, he asked me to. 
 Oh, sh1t. Sorry, Marius. 
 You heard about Winslow? 
 Found dead in the Connecticut woods. 
 Police chatter says it looks like a professional hit. 
 You got lucky. 
 Ahem. 
 To be honest, he was a so-so husband. 
 But he was a good friend. 
 He was a great dancer, and he was an excellent con. 
 And he was the brother that you never had. 
 So to Charlie. 
 Charlie. 
 Charlie. 
 Charlie. 
 Charlie. 
 Charlie. 
 No, you don't have to do that. 
 Charlie. 
 What? I didn't know the guy. 
 All right, man. Take it easy. 
 All right, go ahead, say it. 
 That wasn't a Turk. 
 There were moving parts. 
 Well, it was pretty close. 
 That wasn't The Turk. 
 It was a damn sweet con. 
 Ha ha ha ha! 
 We'll get it right next time, all right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll see you around. 
 [laughing] 
 Later, Porter. 
 Keep out of trouble, Eddie! 
 [car engine starts] 
 So where are we going? 
 How about to Vegas with me? 
 Vegas? 
 I'm buying a stake in a little casino. 
 You can deal or, I don't know, security. You choose. 
 You always wanted to deal in Vegas. 
 Yeah, but you hate Vegas. 
 I do. 
 I'm not going with you. 
 No, seriously. 
 Eddie, I got a parole officer I got to worry about. 
 Uh... 
 Then no. Then f*ck it. 
 I'm not going. I'll stay here with you. 
 Eddie. Eddie. 
 What... 
 It's time we went our separate ways, Eddie. 
 What? 
 [taxi door opens] 
 No. No. 
 It's always been me and you our whole lives. 
 And look where that's gotten you. 
 Look, I don't blame you for any of this... 
 But you should. I'm the one who got you into it. 
 That's not true. 
 I always get you into it. 
 Eddie. 
 Eddie, why do you think you weren't kissed in all of this? 
 Because you figured you couldn't trust me. 
 I get it. 
 I do trust you. 
 Eddie, I trust you. 
 I knew, when Vince put a gun to my head, you'd cough it up just to save me. 
 You can't help it, Eddie. You're a good guy. 
 You're not cut out for the life. 
 Am I right? 
 No, it's not true. 
 Am I right? 
 I'm right. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Come here. 
 We should get going, Eddie. 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 You take care of my brother, all right? 
 You take care of yourself, all right? 
 m*therf*cker. 
 [engine starts] 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I get a panic call from Carly in the middle of the night. 
 She's worried about you guys. 
 I told her I'd come check. 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 I'm gonna go make some calls. 
 See what I can find out. 
 Sam. 
 You didn't need to come here. 
 Jesus, Audrey. 
 You all right? 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 It's none of your f*cking business. 
 Whatever happened, we're still friends. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, so... we're here. We're fine. 
 You can go now. 
 Otto. 
 I need a word. 
 All right. 
 I'm listening. 
 I want to clear the air about something. 
 You know, when you were sick, Audrey and I... were alone in the office... a lot. 
 And I... 
 I hit on her. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 You know what she did? 
 She punched me in the nose. 
 And I had it coming. 
 That's why I left for A&B. 
 It was just going to be too weird. 
 She's devoted to you, Otto. 
 Don't be stupid. 
 Tell her. 
 Tell her what? 
 The house painter. 
 You didn't hire him to hit Dockery, did you? 
 He gone? 
 Yeah. 
 We have to talk before Taylor comes in. 
 He said you got a man killed. 
 Uh, I... I don't know his name. 
 He came in the office, and Dockery's guy thought it was a robbery. 
 Stuck a knife in him. 
 Dockery took the body. 
 What happens if somebody comes looking for him? 
 They won't. 
 We can't be sure. 
 Audrey... he was a hit man. 
 How do you know? 
 Because I hired him. 
 I don't understand. 
 Who were you going to kill? 
 He was supposed to cut me and make it look like a robbery. 
 To get the insurance. 
 It's the only way I could... 
 God damn it, Otto! 
 That hurt! 
 Don't you know how much I need you? 
 I don't... 
 [door opens] 
 I don't think I know that's true anymore. 
 [door closes] 
 Nobody's saying anything. 
 The FBI dropped a cone of silence of the... 
 Should I come back later? 
 No. 
 No. 
 So they give you anything? 
 There was one arrest. It wasn't Pete. 
 So where is he? 
 Judge dropped the case against Dockery. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 No, it's all right. 
 Audrey : It's not all right. 
 Pete's got Dockery's money... all of it. 
 I worked something out with Dockery. 
 I took care of it. 
 Took care of it how? 
 That's not your concern. 
 I took care of it. 
 [truck approaching] 
 I guess we need to talk. 
 Before you start making up some bullshit story, we know. 
 You know what? 
 We know you took Dockery's money from your grandmother to gamble in a poker room in Chinatown. 
 Betrayed your own family. 
 You're right. 
 And, uh, this doesn't make it okay... but I was in hock to some really bad people. 
 You mean Vince? 
 What do you know about Vince? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 How much did you lose? 
 Some of it? 
 All of it? 
 Lose? 
 I'm sorry it took me so long to get back. 
 I, uh... 
 I just needed to tie up some loose ends. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, you smell amazing. 
 Don't you have to get the guy started? 
 You know what? 
 He can wait his turn. 
 Yeah? 
 Mm. 
 [phone ringtone] 
 Oh, that's Amelia. 
 [ring] 
 It's Marius. 
 Marius can go f*ck himself. 
 [laughing] 
 [ring] 
 [ring] 
 He says we don't have to worry about Winslow anymore. 
 Since when? 
 Since he got himself killed. 
 [ring] 
 Uh, he says "Check the Mets score." 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Oh, God damn it, Marius. 
 What's the matter? 
 Nothing. I just... 
 Oh, God damn it, Marius. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm taking the money back to Dockery. 
 I thought you worked something out. 
 Maybe there's still time to unring that bell. 
 [door opens, closes] 
 Why did you have to lie about everything? 
 Audrey : Why do you think? 
 He's one of us. 
 I guess you're right. 
 Well, I... I guess it's best if I just move on. 
 Okay. I'm here. 
 Your collateral, all of it. 
 Thought we had a deal. 
 We did. But... there's your money. 
 I don't need the money. 
 I need someone to launder it. 
 You said bail bond's a cash business, so it'll be easy. 
 Let's start with that. 
 [engine starts] 
 [knock on door] 
 Hey. 
 I was asleep. 
 Right. 
 You, uh... 
 You asked me to trust you. 
 I didn't. 
 I should have. 
 Well, I didn't really give you any reason to. 
 Don't wait another 20 years. 
 I won't. 
 And thank you for saving my life. 
 I was going to say the same thing to you. 
 You're leaving. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Lucky. 
 I don't know about that. 
 I'll miss you, Cousin Pete. 
 Okay. 
 Sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, wait. Y-You got a... 
 What? 
 ... sticker right there. 
 Where? Huh? 
 [chuckle] It was a mark on your jacket. 
 Never mind. 
 [honk] 
 There's my... That's my ride right there. 
 All right. 
 See ya. 
 That was better. 
 What? 
 You know, this is... this is not a life. 
 That's a life. 
 Let's go. 
 So what about that family back there? 
 ♪ I'm so tired of being alone ♪ 
 What do you mean? 
 How much did you take them for? 
 Oh, it was a wash. 
 What happened? 
 You get attached or something? 
 I don't get attached. 
 It's the first rule of the life. 
 Don't get attached. 
 ♪ Inside my silent asylum ♪ 
 So long, kid. 
 That's it? 
 ♪ Oh-oh  ♪ 
♪  Oh, don't leave me on my own ♪ 
 Here. 
 The Amazing Gowango? 
 Is this a joke? 
 No, he does, uh, retirement homes and kids' parties. 
 I think you two would hit it off. 
 ♪ Left me standing all alone  ♪ 
♪  Cut me down to size  ♪ 
♪  So I, oh, I can fit inside  ♪ 
♪  Lies that will divide us both in time ♪ 
 [muffled shout] 
 Taylor! 
 Taylor! 
 Oof! 
 What the f*ck! 
 I can't f*cking... This is... Taylor! 
 Hey, Pete. 
 Do I know you guys? 
 No. 
 It wasn't easy arranging to introduce ourselves, either. 
 Gina. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 You don't know us. 
 But we know a lot about you. 
 Big fans, as a matter of fact. 
 Listen, listen, I'm not Pete. 
 [laughing] 
 Yo, you're f*cking funny. 
 He is f*cking funny, right? 
 He's kind of funny. 
 Yeah. 
 Got a copy of your f*cking driver's license, right? 
 Huh? It's not you, though. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, uh... that's a fake I had made. 
 Hilarious. 
 Also got a printout of your prison release. 
 It took us a while to figure out why you robbed that gun range. 
 But figure it out we did. 
 So if you don't do what we want, we'll burn down that farm and kill everyone inside. 
 Huh? 
 What do you want me to do? 
 We want you to take us to your mother and the $11 million.
