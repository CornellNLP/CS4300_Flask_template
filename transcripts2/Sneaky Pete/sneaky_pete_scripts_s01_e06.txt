 Otto, what are you doing? 
 I know you took the money. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Chayton Dockery's collateral: 150,000 in cash. 
 Trial starts today. 
 It's in the safe. 
 Audrey, I looked. Okay? 
 What I don't understand is why you lied to me, made me think you changed the combination because I'm addle-brained. 
 I never said that. 
 You did. 
 Know where my mind went? 
 You and Sam. 
 I actually thought that you took the money and ran off together. 
 How could you ever think that? 
 Pieces seemed to fit. 
 Sam jumped ship same time you changed the combination. 
 So you figured, since you cheated, I did, too? 
 I suppose that was part of it. 
 We've been married a long time. 
 [sigh] 
 I can tell you're in a jam. 
 I don't want to have you lie to me again, but I just want to ask one question. 
 Dockery's trial lasts a couple of weeks. 
 Can you get the money back by then? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Otto, where are you going? 
 I'm not going to let you go to jail or worse, depending on how Dockery takes the news. 
 Otto. 
 Wait.

 Oh, my God. 
 What a cute little boy. 
 I got a thing Thursday. How's Friday? 
 Seriously, you should put him in a commercial. 
 Really? You think so? 
 Oh, for sure. 
 Hi. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 I'm so sorry to bother you. 
 I'm trying to find the Housatonic Museum of Art, and I'm looking for the right bus line. I can't find it. 
 I was wondering if you could help me out. 
 Yeah. Let's see the schedule. 
 Okay. 
 She's good with this stuff. 
 Oh, good. Yeah. Look. 
 It looks like an abstract painting or something like that. 
 Maybe if you take the 3 to the 5? 
 No, no, no. 
 You walk two blocks south. You take the 1. 
 Easy-peasy. 
 Easy-peasy. There it is. 
 If you want, we can show you. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no. That's fine. 
 I think I can manage by myself. Thank you. 
 You know, I have to say, uh, last night, I didn't think that much of Bridgeport, but after meeting you two, uh, all that's turned around. 
 So thank you so much. 
 Oh, you're welcome. 
 You're beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Look at you. Yeah. 
 You're lucky. 
 Thank you. 
 [laughing] 
 Lucky guy. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 What? 
 I think that asshole took us. 
 Baby. 
 Sit down, you beautiful people. 
 That's not cool, man. 
 Isn't there a code? 
 Honor among thieves? 
 You stole from me first. 
 Yeah. Well, we didn't know you were in the game. 
 Give us back our sh1t. 
 No, that's not enough. 
 I want to know how you pulled this off. 
 Honestly, you were just overconfident. 
 I wrapped myself up like a candy bar. 
 You two were so hungry, you bit. 
 Here. Here's your stuff. 
 Well, not technically yours because you stole it like a bunch of hooligans. 
 Okay. It's been fun. Let's go. 
 Your timing is good on the lifts. 
 You know how to take a wallet out of bed and put it on its feet. 
 You, it's like all you know how to do is spank down time. 
 You just want to take advantage of opportunity. 
 Not for nothing, but it would take somebody like you years to become a single-o. 
 You're a single-o? 
 You get good enough after a while, another person just becomes dead weight. 
 Okay, you lifted a couple of wallets and a cell from a backpack. 
 Not exactly Houdini. 
 You know what Houdini said about pickpockets? 
 He said the best pickpockets are women. 
 Why? Because they're patient. 
 He got you? 
 What the f*ck. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Hey, you're not just a single-o. 
 You're a goddamn cannon. 
 You got to pass the bone, man, lay out how you do that. 
 I need a favor from you guys. 
 What kind of favor? 
 Do you guys have a car you can get around in? 
 What if we do? 
 Have you ever tailed anybody? 
 Yeah, if the vic has got enough. 
 Haven't been caught, either. 
 Good. So I need you to tail somebody for me. 
 Why do you do it? 
 Why do you ask so many questions? 
 It's $300. 
 $300. Are you in or you out? 
 Out. 
 Hold on. 
 If we do this, you teach us some sh1t. 
 Okay. 
 In. 
 f*ck it. In, I guess. 
 [phone rings] 
 [whistles] 
 Oh, God, you saved my life. 
 f*cking I'm starving. 
 Mm. You want to eat? 
 Coffee's fine. 
 Something wrong? 
 No. All good. 
 We're still on for the 3rd, right? 
 Huh? 
 Fishing? Dressel Lake? 
 Jimmy's already booked the cabin and the boat, and he needs everybody to pay up. 
 Completely slipped my mind. 
 Gonna have to pass this year. 
 What? No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 I'm gonna drag Pete along. You can't miss that. 
 It's nice to see you guys close again. 
 It's been a long time. 
 Hey. Uh, something I want to ask you. 
 You remember Chayton Dockery? 
 Yeah. Charged with possession of a methamphetamine precursor, right Yeah. Your grandmother posted bond for him when I was laid up, so I wasn't tracking it. 
 I just realized the trial starts today. 
 Lance is defending him. 
 Wondering what the good word was on the case. 
 From what I hear, it's a pretty solid case. 
 Second bust. Got caught with a sh1t ton of pseudo-ephedrine, and there's no reason you would have all that unless you were making meth. 
 Still circumstantial. 
 Until one of his guys rolled on him as a witness. 
 He's going away for a long time unless Lance can pull a rabbit out of his ass. 
 But... if anybody could. 
 [chuckle] 
 Oh, excuse me. Uh, may I? 
 I... I was hoping you could help me with a little information. 
 Depends what it is. 
 Well, Ida... what a lovely name. You see, I bought some investment property recently. 
 I just had a fire at my home. 
 Lost all my family heirlooms, photos of my kids and grandkids. 
 It was absolutely awful. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 Why, thank you. 
 And I managed to lose all the paperwork on the investment property, too. 
 I can get you a copy of the deed. 
 That would just be so wonderful. 
 But I need to track down the original owner. 
 I found something on the property I'd like to return. 
 You can search that information online. 
 I did. The thing is it's listed as a shell company. 
 I need the name and the home address of the owner. 
 I seem to recall that her first name was, uh, Victoria. 
 I can't give out personal information. 
 Are you sure? It was a lovely gold tennis bracelet. 
 It had her name engraved on it. 
 Looked to be quite valuable. 
 If it were me, I'd certainly want it back. 
 Sorry, but I can't. 
 May I just say that's a lovely sweater? 
 Is that a brioche stitch? 
 You know, I have tried and tried brioche, but I always manage to drop a stitch halfway through. 
 Last time it happened, I actually cried. 
 The key is to drop the stitch all the way down to where you made the mistake and just pop that one out. 
 Just like that? 
 Just like that. 
 Well, your handiwork certainly speaks for itself. 
 Tell me, do you ever sell your work? 
 I'd love a sweater like that. 
 Niece just made it for me. 
 Wanted me to wear it to work. 
 The only reason I'm wearing this thing. 
 Well, we all do things for family, don't we? 
 Tell you what. 
 Why don't you go ahead and order a sweater for me from your niece? 
 It's always good to help young people starting out. 
 For a sweater like this one. 
 Of course. 
 What else would it be for? 
 You have an address on that investment property? 
 [beep] 
 Otto, God damn it, I've left ten messages. 
 Call me back. 
 I'm handling things. 
 Just don't do anything foolish. 
 I... 
 [click, dial tone] 
 Just checking to see if you're set for today. 
 You need a ride to the court later or anything? 
 No, I'm set. 
 Ah. 
 Come in, Otto. 
 Come in. 
 Ah, Kwahu! Ha. 
 For you and Audrey. 
 Oh. 
 I know how much she loves venison. 
 Ohh, my Lord, she'll be thrilled. 
 Thank her for posting Chayton's bond. 
 Not everyone would have. 
 Well, we go back a long way, Kwahu. 
 Happy to be of any help. 
 I'm worried, Otto. 
 Dad, there's no reason to worry. 
 I've been in prison. 
 Got the longest sentence they could give. 
 I don't want that for you. 
 Second bust. 
 He's facing ten years, and that's a best case. 
 Dad. 
 Listen to your son, Kwahu. 
 It's no good thinking the worst. 
 Doesn't help anything. 
 Uh... walk me to the truck. 
 I didn't want to say anything in front of your father, but, um... 
 I understand his concern. 
 I lost my kids. 
 And I would do anything to protect my grandkids. 
 [sigh] Chayton, I've heard from, um... a reliable source that the case against you is strong. 
 You may be having to spend some time in jail. 
 When I think of Kwahu and what that might do to him... 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 I know some people... for a small price, could safely get you to a reserve in Canada and then get you overseas. 
 So you think I should run. 
 I'm just trying to be straight with you here, son. 
 If you do this, this won't be easy, but, uh, you'll have your freedom, and your father won't have to look at your face behind bars for years. 
 But you'd have to decide fast. 
 You know, I appreciate your honesty. 
 Very few people would have been so forthright. 
 But I'm gonna take my chances with the judge. 
 Thanks for thinking of me. 
 You're a good man. 
 [door closes] 
 What does he want with me? 
 No idea. 
 Dude, I can't take this, man. Just tell me. 
 He didn't say. 
 [muttering] 
 sh1t. Let me go, man! 
 Listen! Chill! 
 I got to get out! 
 You run on that foot, you're gonna f*ck it up worse. 
 f*ck you. 
 Move.

 What is this? 
 What the f*ck is this? 
 Hey. There he is. 
 Thought we'd have a little lunch together. 
 Got your favorites: peking duck and chow mein, that shitty tofu dish you like. 
 You're joking, right? 
 No. No. Hey. Come on. 
 Here. Take a seat. 
 Eat. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 Ah, come on, Richard. 
 If he wants to stand, it's okay. 
 I just thought, you know, considering your... condition now, maybe the equilibrium's a little off or something. 
 Look, I don't mean to make fun of you. 
 What happened was regrettable, but I didn't create the problem. Your brother did. 
 We're just stuck in the middle of it, you and me. 
 It doesn't mean we can't help each other, right? 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 You want me to help you? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Mm. Oh, my God. It's fantastic. 
 Thank you, honey. Come on, Eddie. 
 Sit down, will you? Let me fix a plate for you here. 
 Look at this. 
 It's your tofu. 
 I don't know why or how you eat that, but... 
 Oh, look. There's some rice. 
 Look, I have a little problem with one of my games, one that I think you can help me with. 
 I see. 
 You have a problem with a game, and you need me to help, so it must be Mukherjee. 
 The f*ck is cheating. 
 I know it, but I can't catch it. 
 So I need you to spot it so I can make him into one of the sorriest M*therf*ckers this side of Mumbai. 
 Okay. 
 If you have a time machine or a toe. 
 Otherwise, f*ck you. 
 You think it's smart to talk to me like that? 
 Look, you need me all happy and smiling to deal with Mukherjee, right? 
 So then what do I get out of it besides frickin' Chinese food? 
 What do you want? 
 What do you think? 
 I want you to forget Marius' debt and let me go. 
 No. 
 That's between Marius and me. 
 I can't give you that. 
 So what? If Marius doesn't get you your money, you're just going to cut off my damn finger? 
 Why don't you just do it now, then? 
 Hmm. 
 All right. 
 Richie. [clicks tongue] 
 Listen, you f*cking sh1t, you want to f*ck with me? 
 Okay. 
 Do it right now. Come on. 
 Sit down, Vince. 
 Let's see what you got, f*ck head. 
 Let's see what you f*cking got! 
 Please, honey, come on. 
 Vince. 
 Okay. 
 Get the sh1t out of here, pussy. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 You want to get Mukherjee. 
 Yeah, but there's only so much I can take, all right? 
 This little punk telling me to f*ck off right to my face. 
 I know. 
 Just... just give me some time with him, okay? 
 I have to fix him up anyway. 
 We don't want Mukherjee. See his favorite dealer all busted up, right? 
 Okay. 
 But Eddie is going to deal that game, or I'm going to take more than one little f*cking toe. 
 Yeah, you will. 
 You will. 
 How do you do that?

 I can explain, but it would be a lot easier if I didn't have a shotgun pointed at me. 
 Nah.

 Can I reach into my right pocket?

 Now get back. 
 [door buzzes] 
 No, no. No. Please don't do that. 
 Please. Just let me explain. 
 30 seconds. 
 Yesterday when I came in here and I told you about that nurse who was stealing from my grandma... 
 I lied. 
 That woman was my grandma. 
 She has dementia. 
 She's been going around pawning the family valuables. 
 I've been all over town trying to track down what she sold. 
 Most of it was worthless, like... like that clock there, but then my father's Rolex went missing, which belonged to his father before him. 
 It's the only memento I have left. 
 So when I came in here and I saw the watch... something came over me. 
 Well, if you ask instead of take, I would have told you that Grandma didn't bring in the watch. 
 Bank manager with gambling problem did. 
 I know that now. 
 We found my father's watch in the back of a drawer, and I wanted to come here and apologize and make it right. 
 Okay. 
 I let you walk. 
 Okay. 
 Under one condition: you never step foot in this store again. 
 Thank you. Okay. 
 Now go. 
 I know I have no right to ask this, but I'm still tracking down everything that my grandmother pawned. 
 You don't have a list of some of the things she brought in here? 
 Come on. You haven't let me open my eyes since we left. 
 If you're gonna whack me, just get it over with. 
 Just a few more steps. 
 Whoo! 
 Okay. Hold on. 
 Open them. 
 What is that? 
 It's a boat I'm negotiating to buy. 
 You're... you're buying that? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Seriously, I can barely keep my head above water with the kids, and you're buying a boat. 
 Are you out of your f*cking mind? 
 That's not fair. 
 I've been trying to help. 
 Every time I think we turned a corner, you just shut me out again. 
 I wonder why. 
 Yeah, that's what it always comes back to. 
 Well, yeah. 
 Okay. I know I f*cked up. 
 How am I supposed to make it up to you when you won't let me? 
 Great. Now we're just f*cking fighting again. 
 This is not how this was supposed to go. 
 Look, you remember, just after Jacob was born, we rented that boat? 
 We took it out to Pleasure Beach? 
 Yeah. I remember. It was the last time I had anything close to a vacation. 
 When we were leaving Bridgeport behind... [sighs] it was like a weight lifted off you. 
 You said, "I wish we owned this boat." 
 We could sail away from here, just you, me, and the kids. 
 Look, what I did... was stupid and really selfish, and I've regretted it ever since. 
 And I'd sor... I'm sorry that you had to find out from someone else... 
 Don't use Audrey as an excuse. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Look, okay. I was the asshole, and I deserved you... kicking me out. 
 You know she didn't tell you that to protect you. Sorry. f*ck. 
 We can go. 
 We can go. 
 No, you're right. 
 I am? 
 She really does think she's protecting me. 
 She just doesn't understand how it feels when someone questions your judgment all the time. 
 And can we please stop talking about Audrey? 
 Sorry I brought it up. 
 All I'm asking for is another chance. 
 I won't push. It's up to you. 
 What's is look like on the inside? 
 [buzz] 
 Ohh. 
 
 
 
 [speed dial] 
 Miss Jemmett, Audrey Bernhardt again. 
 We need to talk. It's important. 
 Yeah. 
 Please get back to me. 
 Ow. What the f*ck, man? It hurts. 
 I'm sorry. I need to make sure you can look presentable for tomorrow. 
 And it'll go faster if you hold still. 
 Yeah, is that what Vince says to you every night? 
 You want me to shut his mouth? 
 We don't need to add any more bruises. 
 I can hit where it won't show. 
 All right. 
 You know, I don't get you. 
 How can you stay with a man like Vince after everything he's done, huh? 
 You can't even go anywhere without this knuckle-dragger behind you. 
 One kidney shot. That's... 
 Stay away from me, man. 
 All right. 
 Stay away from me. 
 Do you trust me? 
 Trust you? 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 I think Eddie's scared and angry, and if I just could have a few minutes alone with him, I can talk him into dealing. 
 Look, ahem, Vince gave me a job, and that job is you. 
 Of course. 
 Hey. 
 Good to see you, huh? 
 Hi. 
 I took the liberty of ordering the Heart Attack Special for you. 
 You know, kid, you're the only one in your family I always am happy to see. 
 I've missed you, Sam. 
 So, uh, you been staying out of trouble? 
 Do I have to bail you out or anything? 
 Nope. Keeping my nose clean. 
 Ha. Now I know you're lying. 
 But at least you haven't been caught. 
 So, my lady, so what do I owe the pleasure of this breakfast invite? 
 For your glaucoma. 
 Now I know you want something. 
 As a matter of fact... 
 That's my girl. 
 Never give something for nothing. 
 So what does old Sam have to do to earn his chronic? 
 Oh, it's about Cousin Pete. 
 You know he just showed up here after 20 years. 
 Well, everyone else is thrilled he's back, but I don't know. Something just doesn't sit right. 
 Like what? 
 I don't think he's Pete. 
 Mind me asking you what makes you think that? 
 I set him up. 
 I found out he had this awful thing happen on his eleventh birthday, something he wouldn't forget. 
 So I fed him this fake story to see if he'd trip up, and he did. 
 Oh, sweetheart. 
 11 years old? 
 Who remembers that? 
 Jesus, I don't even remember what I just ate. 
 Sam, I'm telling you something is off about this guy. 
 Okay. 
 Look, I'm not saying you're wrong, but I mean this in the nicest possible way. 
 Why would anyone lie their way into your family? 
 Here's what I know about Cousin Pete. 
 I tried to tell your grandma... 
 You talked to Grandma about Pete? 
 Oh, now look, forget I ever said... 
 Sam, come on. 
 Uh... 
 Okay. 
 I shouldn't be telling you this. 
 Your grandma had me tail him when he first got here. 
 He's a criminal. 
 He's got connections in New York. 
 If he's as bent as I think he is, it'll all come out. 
 But don't you get involved. 
 You do nothing. 
 [cough] 
 [Julia laughing] 
 I can't believe we just did that. 
 [laughing] 
 You got to admit that was pretty good. 
 It's always good. 
 It's everything else that's the problem. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, you're really very beautiful. 
 Knock it off. 
 You still get embarrassed when somebody gives you a compliment? 
 Well, I don't. I... no. 
 Yeah, you do. [chuckling] 
 Fine. Thank you for the compliment. 
 I really should get out of here. 
 Look, I, uh... 
 I need to say something, and it might freak you out at first, so just bear with me. 
 Okay. 
 I said I don't want to push. 
 But I don't want to wait, either. 
 I just want us to be a family. 
 You, me, Ellen, Jacob. 
 I want to show you that I've changed. 
 And if I say I'm not... ready for that yet? 
 Then I'll respect that. 
 I just want you to know where I stand. 
 Okay. 
 I know where you stand. 
 Okay. 
 We have the Dockery case this afternoon. 
 I really need a shower anyway. 
 [shower runs] 
 [phone buzzes] 
 Well, where is he, Ms. Crew? 
 Your Honor, the witness was properly subpoenaed and had every intention of testifying. 
 Mr. Clark went hunting on Wednesday and hasn't come back. 
 I request a continuance until we're able to locate him. 
 Your Honor, as the prosecution's case hinges on this witness' testimony, move for an immediate mistrial. 
 I wouldn't go that far, Mr. Lord. 
 Ms. Crew, this being Friday, I'll give you till Monday to produce your witness. 
 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 Next case. 
 Why haven't you returned my calls? 
 Oh, God. Jesus Christ, Audrey. 
 Why haven't you returned my calls? 
 I was going to right after I got out of court. 
 You've been in court for three days. 
 Yeah, I have something of a life, too, still. 
 I need my money back now. 
 You need to have a little patience. 
 You told me they were going to make the announcement last week, that we'd be able to sell our properties in seconds. 
 Yeah, okay. It's just taking a little more time... 
 I don't have any more time. 
 If you're in some kind of a jam, I can help. 
 The jam I'm in you can't help.

 Last stop was the courthouse.

 You're meant for this. He's not. 
 Lose the boyfriend, then we'll talk. 
 Can I just sit here for a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 Is something wrong? 
 I just don't know what to say without sounding stupid. 
 That's never stopped you before. 
 Ha ha ha ha ha. 
 Ellen and Jacob are the most important people in my life. 
 I would do anything for them. 
 Sure. 
 But it... it just... it gets hard doing it alone. 
 No, I know. Yeah. I grew up with a single mom. 
 Okay. So the thing is Lance and I have been getting close again. 
 It was all going really well... 
 I mean, not just the s*x, which was always good. 
 Okay. 
 Um, so anyway, uh, a while back, I had this dumb dream of having a boat. 
 I never thought in a million years he'd remember something like that, but he did. 
 And so now he wants to buy one for me and the kids. 
 He wants to buy you a boat? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. That's great. 
 That's great. 
 You know what else is great is rent and groceries and... 
 Oh, yeah. He's always offered to help, but I always push him away. 
 I mean, you know, I could be a little bit proud and, uh... 
 Sure. stubborn. I wonder where I get that from. 
 So it sounds like, uh, ahem, sounds like you guys are working things out. 
 That's great. 
 Well, uh, no. 
 Uh, remember how I told you that he cheated on me? 
 It was with a law clerk from the courthouse. 
 Tricia. She was his liaison, and I guess they liaised in the biblical sense. 
 Word got back to Audrey... 
 I just don't know how she finds everything out. 
 Anyway, she told me, which I'm sure she enjoyed, and I kicked him out. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. With the suits and all that. 
 I might have neglected to mention I was chasing him with a baseball bat. 
 So you think he's doing it again? 
 Uh, well, uh, uh... 
 Oh, God. 
 I saw this thing on his phone... telling him to pay... pay Victoria's rent. 
 Why would he p-pay... pay somebody's rent unless he was f*cking her? 
 You know? It's like am I overreacting here? 
 No, I... 
 Am I freaking out for no reason? 
 I think you should follow your instincts on that... 
 Oh, yeah! What are those, right? 
 Ha ha ha! 
 Whoo. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. This is so stupid. 
 It's okay. 
 Why don't I just ask him, for f*ck's sake? I mean... that... that message can mean anything. 
 Right? 
 It's like I immediately just let myself, like, spin out into the dark. 
 Oh, my God. Thank you so much for listening, Pete. 
 I really just needed to talk to somebody who wouldn't judge me. 
 Thank you. 
 I can't even believe they're taking this case seriously. 
 The guy threatened me, he attacked my car, and he knew I was a cop. 
 Look, I told you they were able to get the surveillance camera. 
 Yeah. After I located it. 
 And the footage covered your car. 
 So there's no proof he did anything. 
 All they've got right now is your word and your cousin's against him. 
 Look, you got a visitor. 
 We'll talk about this later. 
 Hi, Carly. 
 What did you hear? 
 Nothing. 
 Yeah, well, whatever you heard, keep it to yourself, okay? 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 It's not like you haven't kept a secret or two for me. 
 Hey, I have something to show you. 
 Something about Pete. 
 Look, Carly, I've had a hell of a day, so whatever it is, it's just going to have to wait, okay? 
 Uh... 
 Come on. Just put it on. 
 Vince wants you in uniform. 
 I just need to see how it fits. Come on. 
 If you want him in the suit, I'll put him in the f*cking suit. 
 Thank you. That won't be necessary. 
 All Eddie needs is a drink to calm his ass down. 
 Eddie doesn't need a drink. 
 Okay, then. Karolina needs a drink. 
 God damn it! 
 What? 
 sh1t. I nearly cut my finger off is what. 
 What should I do? 
 Can you just get me a Band-aid? 
 Where? 
 From the bathroom? 
 Please just hurry? 
 Okay. 
 I just bought us 30 seconds. 
 How should we spend it? 
 Marius was here last night. 
 Bullshit. 
 He had a gun, and he was going to kill anyone who came between you and him. 
 Why didn't he? 
 I made him back down. 
 What? Why? 
 Why? Because he would have been killed, and so would you. 
 And I already have Charlie's death on my hands. 
 We all do. 
 Now listen, I'm working with Marius. 
 We're going to take Vince down. 
 You okay? How's your hand? 
 It's still bleeding. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. Well, the good news is Eddie says he's ready to deal. 
 Right, Eddie? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Sorry. You are? 
 The manager. And you are? 
 Oh, yeah. Hi. Uh, Keith Conway. 
 I'm, uh, in town for the, uh, for the [mumble] Museum. 
 I rented this place online. 
 There was supposed to be a key under the mat for me, but I couldn't find it. 
 Rented it from who? 
 From, uh, uh, Victoria... uh, Victoria Jama... Janet... Jemmett. Jemmett. 
 Did you ever meet her? 
 No. 
 That makes two of us. 
 What do you mean? 
 Never laid eyes on her. 
 There's no furniture in the place. 
 Doesn't look like she ever moved in. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 What, do you think she ripped me off? 
 That's between you and her. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Is there any contact information you could give me so I could track her down? 
 Look, she pays on time every month, cash, through the mail slot. 
 As long as that happens, owners don't care about much else. 
 Okay. Thank you, you f*cking asshole. 
 Whew. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I need to talk to you about something. 
 Whatever it is, it can wait. 
 I'm in a very bad mood. 
 I think your mood's going to get worse. 
 Can we talk about it later? 
 Pete's a criminal. 
 [door closes] 
 I know who has the money. 
 Who? 
 Julia's ex. 
 The lawyer. 
 He's got Audrey on the hook for 175 grand. 
 [scoff] 
 You have any idea what kind of con he's running? 
 From what I can see, I think it's the Spanish prisoner. 
 And you want to do what? 
 I want to do a rollover. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Joseph, it's Marjorie. Listen, Marius is here. 
 We need your help... 
 We could run a badger game. 
 Now, we worked a great one in Philly about ten years ago. 
 No, the timing's wrong. 
 He's making a play for Julia. 
 I don't think he's stupid enough to f*ck that up with another woman. 
 Well, we can't count on it anyway. 
 No. 
 I keep thinking another land con. 
 But maybe he smells that? 
 Yeah, or maybe he's so sure of himself, he wouldn't see it coming. 
 Yeah. 
 Hubris. Nothing lays a man lower. 
 Almost nothing. 
 What if we salt it? 
 Uh, salting could work. 
 Um, hard to pull off, giving he knows you. 
 Yeah, or maybe that's why it works... because he wouldn't suspect me of trying to con him if he's busy suspecting me of trying to f*ck my cousin. 
 Are you? 
 I don't have a cousin. 
 Joseph : If she's hot, then why not, right? 
 It's not like she's really your cousin. 
 All right, stay on topic. 
 If you're going to put together a salt con this fast, you're gonna need someone who's done it before. 
 Porter. 
 No, he thinks I got his brother killed. 
 Well, he's wrong. 
 I'm not so sure about that. 
 Well, I am. 
 Hey, look, if Marjorie can get past it, then... 
 Past it? 
 I'm saving up all my anger for the man who pulled the trigger. 
 I'm going to make coffee. 
 Anyway, from what I heard, Porter isn't doing so great. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [laughing] 
 You scared the sh1t out of me. 
 Something wrong? 
 We know you're a criminal, Pete. 
 Is that you? 
 Is it true, Pete? 
 Did you do time? 
 Yes. 
 And that's exactly why you need me.
