 Original Air Date on August 9, 2012 
 [Car horn blares] 
 You're late. 
 Nope. 30 seconds early. 
 Good. Learning to tell time. 
 Ha ha ha. 
 I won't be in today. 
 What? Does Jessica know? 
 I don't tell Jessica everything. 
 Oh, it's like a "Harvey Specter's day off" kind of a thing? Should I call Ed Rooney, see if we can get Sloane out of school? 
 Not in the mood today. 
 Life moves pretty fast if you don't stop and look around once in a while. 
 What do you think about Hardman running for managing partner? 
 Think he's going to win. 
 Why? 
 Because you don't call for a vote unless you have the votes. 
 Good. 
 We need to tip the scales in her favor. 
 Okay. What do you need me to do? 
 I need you to step up. 
 You're not going to like it. 
 And Jessica can't know it came from me. 
 I gave Hardman the road map to settling with Tanner. 
 You voted for it. 
 Haven't we done enough to Jessica? 
 We're not doing this to Jessica, we're doing this  for  Jessica. 
 We gonna cross the line with this? 
 We've been crossing lines long before we even ever met. 
 How do I know the Patriots aren't going 19-0? 
 Because no team from Boston is going undefeated when the road goes through New York. 
 You got that right. 
 Goddamn Patriots. 
 Your dad called. 
 I'll call him later. 
 He always asks why the idiots in charge He's right. 
 You have that look on your face. 
 Louis is getting a secretary. 
 Her name... is Norma. 
 What is she, 100 years old? 
 She won't last a week. 
 You heard it here first. 
 Oh, and Jessica's on her way down. 
 So, you buried the Jessica news to lead with the Louis news. 
 I'm not apologizing for who I am. 
 [Knocking, door squeaking open] 
 Hi, is this the location of the douchebag convention? 
 It is now. 
 I thought you went to work. 
 I had to get this. 
 Whoa. 
 Look at that. The world's smallest burrito. 
 Which is why I got more. 
 Whoa. Breakfast of champions. 
 Trevor, I can't. 
 I'm a bike messenger. 
 I deliver packages, or people die. 
 Am I gonna have to give you a code red? 
 Both: Mm... 
 Okay. 
 Ohh. 
 All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. 
 Well, what can I say? 
 Really? Okay. 
 I gotta go to work. 
 Thank you. 
 Remember, we're going out tonight, so... you know, don't be you. 
 Oh, wait a minute. I still owe you from last week. 
 No, no, no, you get the dickhead discount. 
 Oh, is that 30%? Or is that the shitface coupon? 
 Same thing, because you're a shitface and a dickhead. 
 Right, got it. Have a great day! 
 Later, asshole. 
 Later. 
 [Door closes] 
 sh1t. 
 I need your help on something. 
 Show me the skulls, I'll crack 'em. 
 Not for this. For this, I need your discretion. 
 I also need to know you'll take it seriously. 
 I haven't worked in the mail room in a long time, Jessica. 
 Someone's stealing from our clients' escrow accounts. 
 Why isn't Daniel here? 
 Daniel's managing partner. 
 Isn't that why Daniel should be here? 
 And I'm in charge of the money. 
 Oh, you want to go to him with a solution, not a problem. 
 You don't always have to let your superiors know what you're up to. I'll try to remember that. 
 Really? I thought you were under the impression you had invented it. 
 What do you need me to do? 
 I need you to step up. 
 Do whatever you have to do to find out who did it, and do it quietly. I will. 
 And when I do, I want you to step up for me. 
 What do you want, Harvey? 
 I'm an associate who kicks more ass than any partner in this goddamn firm. 
 I want a seat at the table. 
 ♪ See the money, wanna stay for your meal ♪ 
♪ get another piece of pie for your wife ♪

 There's so many partners, it could be anyone of them. 
 Watson scares the kids, but I don't make him for the embezzler. 
 The embezzler? He's not a Batman villain. 
 And it's just that kind of thinking that has led you to not catching him. 
 I was just assigned this 15 minutes ago. 
 Have you ever looked into Dortch's eyes? 
 Yeah, he's cross-eyed. 
 Or is he? 
 What does that even mean? 
 Is there a reward for this? 
 Yes. I make Jessica happy, I make partner. 
 Ooh, then we get a bigger office. 
 Then I get a bigger office. 
 Hey, I'm helping you out here. 
 Are you? 
 What do you think about Ginsberg? 
 We need to follow the money. 
 Which will lead straight to Rutherford. 
 This would be so much more fun with margaritas. 
 Okay, that's it. I need facts, and I need them right now. Well then, why did you ask me to guess who did it? 
 I didn't. 
 Then why am I here? 
 I need you to tell me who handles these five escrow accounts. 
 Oh. Well, that's easy. 
 Zoe. 
 God, why didn't you just say so in the first place? 
 Get out. 
 If you want to talk to Monica Eton, call her yourself. 
 I called her, but she hung up the minute I said Pearson Hardman. 
 Of course she did. She hates everybody here. 
 She doesn't hate you. 
 Well, no, but that's because I'm adorable. 
 See, I can't help you with that. 
 So why don't you try using your powers of adorability for good? Not a word. 
 And that is not being adorable. 
 Mike, seriously, this is not a small thing. 
 Look, the last time you asked me to help you it was about Donna, and look at how that turned out. 
 Okay, that wasn't me, and this isn't that-- 
 Monica Eton is not Donna. 
 Maybe not, but she still means something to me. 
 So tell me why I should convince her to talk to someone who works at a firm that she hates. 
 Because... 
 You don't know the real reason why she left. 
 Monica. 
 Hey, it's so funny running into you. 
 Louis, we both work here. 
 Yeah. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I joined the Hudson Racquet Club. 
 You know, I just figured I'd treat myself for making junior partner. 
 Good for you. 
 Yeah, I'd love to get you out on the court. 
 Maybe like, if you're available Saturday? 
 I can't. 
 I can't Saturday, but-- 
 Monica, Louis. 
 Harvey. 
 H-dog. 
 No. 
 What? 
 No, listen. I wanted to talk to you about-- 
 Cashing and burning with Monica? 
 I didn't crash and burn with her. 
 So why don't you stop quoting whatever "B" movie that came from, and call me when you finally see  Amadeus. 
 Salieri, Mozart. 
 Are you wearing braces? 
 Proudly. 
 Walk me through that. 
 I will walk you through it. 
 Uh, for starters, it costs $15,000-- 
 Okay, I don't have time for this. 
 I heard you had a closed-door meeting with Jessica. 
 I did. Or I didn't. 
 Either way, it's none of your business. 
 I just think it's weird when, you know, you have a one-on-one with her, when you're an associate and I'm a junior partner. 
 Proudly wearing braces. 
 You mi--for your information, it is a very small step from junior to senior partner when you have straight teeth. 
 Just know that people take you very seriously. 
 [Snapping fingers] 
 That tie. I have the same one. 
 I don't want to see it again. 
 What would he have said if you weren't wearing braces? 
 What a dick. 
 Mark my words, if I am ever in charge of anyone, I am going to be the most beloved leader that those lucky bastards have ever seen. 
 You know what I'd do, I'd be-- 
 H-dog? H-dog? 
 Zoe Lawford. 
 I'm sorry, you are? 
 The only man here who could beat you at pool. 
 Uh, head-to-head is even. 
 I'm up by one. 
 Well, I thought you'd given up altogether. 
 You don't call, you don't write. 
 I was just trying to give it a little time. 
 You know, letting mystery build back up. 
 You mean you didn't know I transferred to beautiful escrow. 
 Hey, I have my finger on the pulse. 
 [Laughing] Really? 
 Name three associates in tax law. 
 Boring, more boring, and boring in a skirt. 
 Oh! August 3rd. 
 Date of my transfer. 
 I did know. 
 We miss you up there. 
 We miss me, or you miss me? 
 We miss you. 
 I need you. 
 You're here to look at my files, aren't you? 
 I need you to type in your password and leave for five minutes. 
 You're doing something wrong. 
 No, I'm fixing something wrong. 
 Fixing what? 
 That, I can't tell you. 
 Why? Don't trust me? 
 I do. But if I tell you, then I'm breaking someone's trust in me. 
 Okay, let me just get this straight. 
 You're asking me to risk my job to help you solve a mysterious problem for an unknown person, based on nothing but your word? 
 That's exactly what I'm asking. 
 Ahh. 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 Oh my God, there's an emergency in wills and trusts. 
 Thank you. Cheers. 
 [Bottles clinking] 
 You ready? I am. Hit me, hit me. 
 All right, um... All right. 
 This guy. Favorite movie. 
 Grease. 
 Both:  2. 
 Yes, I agree with you. Oh. What about this, Rico Suave over here, what are you thinking? Shaves his chest. No. No, no, man, that's a thing that like, real men do now. Oh, I don't think so. Yeah-- I'm sorry, did you just say real men shave their chests? Oh, um, not... not real men. Just me. That's all. I like him. He's funny. And hairless. Oh, I'm Jenny. Mike. And just so you guys know, uh, he shaves his chest because he is, I'm very proud of him, an Olympic swimmer. I am. Is that right? So that's what you do when you meet girls, you lie? Totally. If they're hot. We also buy them drinks, I'm not sure if-- Oh, we drink. Uh, yeah. Bartender? Yeah? No, go for it. Wait, no way a girl thought you were a point guard for the Knicks. Well, you've never seen me dribble. Uh, I would like to know something about you that's not a lie. Ooh. Um... I love my grandmother. Well, now we know why he's single. Come on, it's kind of sweet. Look, I... I'm not usually in it for him, but I really gotta step in here. Um... Dude's a genius. Trevor, stop. No, no, no-- What do you mean, genius? All right. It's not a thing, it's just-- No, no, no, here we go. Ask him a math question. Hard as you want. Trevor. Hard as you want! Anything. What's 75 times 863, minus 10? 64,715. Bang. How do we know that's right? Uh, it's right. It's right. All right, think of a book you read in high school, he will recite the first page... I don't want to do this, Verbatim. I don't want to do it. Come on, come on, come on, just do it--do it for me. Moby Dick. "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago, "never mind how long ago precisely, "having little or no money--" Old Man and the Sea. "The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff "along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish--" I know that one, that's not right. Oh, no, no, no. I got bored, I did page seven. Curious George. I can't. I can't do that. What? Come on, you can do the other ones, you don't know  Curious George? I never read  Curious George. You never read  Curious George? Monkeys freak me out. My girlfriend and I have to go to the bathroom. Mmhmm. I have to go to the bathroom. And when we come back, these drinkies-- Will be filled. Absolutely, 100%. [Sighs heavily] Dude, what are you doing? Are you trying to blow this? What are you talking about? I know that you have  Curious George,  I've seen it on your bookshelf. For once, we don't have to lie. My mom gave me that book. She read it to me every night. I'm not going to use it to just pick up some girl. You don't have to do anything. Let me tell them. Okay? You'll probably go home with both of them. Trevor. Stop. Fine. I hate your guts. I followed the money. Let's hear it. Louis Litt is the man we're looking for. Are you sure? I told you I followed the money. Which, by the way, he's been spending left and right. You're talking about the braces. $15,000. Not to mention the Hudson Racquet Club. Who knows what else? That club costs $60,000 a year. What are you going to do? I'm gonna break him down, and I'm gonna crack him open. [Knocking on glass door ] You wanted to see me? I did. Well, if this is about Norma? Truth be told, we can do a lot better. This isn't about Norma. Pray tell. How can your your newest junior partner be of service to thee? Pray tell? You can pray tell me how the hell you got the nerve to stand in front of my face after what you did. I couldn't help it. All those late nights. Your fibers are so tantalizing. What? I fell asleep on your couch, just once, because it's so damn soft. Not the topic of this conversation. Is this about the MySpace profile? Because I can take that down. Okay, fine. You got me. I've copied the complete works of Shakespeare and I've charged it to those bastards at C.M., I regularly raid Harvey's liquor, and I've taken every raspberry-bran bar from the kitchen that we've ever bought... Louis- I need to know where Stanley gets them, do you? Enough! Well, should I just... what, pack my things? Not necessary. Thank you, Jessica. Thank you for your mercy. Louis. Yeah. You will replace every one of those goddamn bran bars. Yes. And, I promise not to walk barefoot in the library ever again. Out. Okay. Next time you bring me a name, make goddamn sure it's the right one. I followed the money. You got lost on the way. You saying Louis was framed? I'm saying you sh1t the bed. I gave you a job to do, and you promptly asked for a seat at the table. You want to sit with the grown-ups? Do your job like a man. Ouch. What? You need me to remove Jessica's foot from your ass? You heard all that? Intercom was on. Couldn't help myself. Has it ever been on before? Has it ever been off? Wait, what? I listen to your private conversations? Gotta go. Wait. What? I don't like to be wrong. It made sense, Harvey. Louis is the firm's financial wizard. Look. Louis might not have done it, but he can help me figure out who did. You're going to ask Louis for help on something this big? When a dog smells a bone, he digs. Doesn't mean you have to tell him what kind of bone he's digging for. Just so we're clear, I'm gonna keep listening to your private conversations. Pickles. Peppers. Here you go. Here you go. That's fine. Oh yeah, that girl Nikki called me. Oh, that's awesome. I don't even know how she got my number, it's weird. I do. I asked her out. She wanted your number instead. I didn't tell her about the  Curious George  thing. What? I don't know, it's-- I just felt like I kind of hit it off more with that Jenny girl, that's all. The blonde? She's not even as hot. I liked her better. Well, you can't do anything now. Girls have rules about that kind of sh1t. Wait a minute. Are you... is this a snake? Are you snaking my girl right now? No, I already did. You called her? Of course I did. What a dick. [Laughing] What? Son of a bitch. I--I don't have rules against that sh1t. Okay. Aw, whatever. That Nikki girl's pretty hot too. Yeah. Look at this clown. He walks like he's got a rod up his ass. Nice haircut, guy. Man, if I ever look like that, shoot me. Monica, you work late all the time. I'm not 22. You are. All I'm saying is, you work 80 hours a week while studying for the LSATs every night. Well right, but that's because this time next year I want to be in law school, and five years from now I want to be a lawyer. Five years from now, you're gonna be a kick-ass lawyer at Pearson Hardman. How often does Louis ask you out? Every single day. There are laws to protect you from sexual harassment, you know. Believe me, the day I need a law to protect me from Louis is the day I stop being a lawyer. Busy? Very funny, Harvey, let's get to it, okay? Because you happen to be interrupting my lunchtime sanctuary. You think I don't know lunchtime sanctuary means staring at Monica? First of all, I'll have you know that I have been coming here way before her. And I will be coming here every Thursday at 1:00 p.m. till the day I die. Now let me see your friend's financials. Why are the names all blacked out? Because of how sensitive it is. How sensitive is it? He works at a powerful firm. I can't tell you which one. They have an embezzler. Ahh, so that's what your closed-door meeting with Jessica was about. We're being hired by another firm. I'm sworn to secrecy. If we can figure out who this is, a very big head will roll. Where? Hufton and Wood? Bagwell and Rose? Oh, come on. Those assholes at Jacobson and Kearney? [Whispering] Look, I told you, I was sworn to secrecy. My God, this is just like a maze of raw data. Can you make any sense of it? Yeah, I already have. Look at this. See? He's setting up this patsy to take the fall. He's not even gonna see it coming, what a "smuck." I'm sorry, did... did you just say, what a "smuck?" No, I said what a "smuck." You mean schmuck. Huh? You know a schmuck, right? "Smuck." 
 
 Monica? Mike Ross. Can I join you? Chair's empty. I appreciate it. Rachel said this was about one of my old cases? This is a lawsuit that we just drew up in your name, seeking $10 million in damages from Pearson Hardman. Should have seen this coming. Five years ago you got screwed. One way to put it. You had options you didn't explore. And you're exploring them for me. I can make what stopped you before go away, yes. Harvey will back your claim. What about Jessica? You don't need Jessica. Why are you doing this? Does it matter? No. It doesn't. I don't want anything to do with this. Last five years haven't been easy for you, have they? You don't know anything about me. I know you've been working retail. It's a boutique on Park Avenue, right? It's a good job, you're making what, maybe 40 grand a year? This is Manhattan. What, are you covering rent with that? So you're the new attack dog. Well, Spot, I'm not revisiting a story I spent the last five years trying to forget. Just take it with you. You may change your mind. And if you call me, I'll come fetch. It's Daniel Hardman. What? He's been playing a shell game. He's moving money out of one account and into another. For an entire year. Your partner sold you out. Daniel has never done anything unethical. And the fact that you don't like him-- I know, isn't reason to falsely accuse him. I'm not. You falsely accused Louis. I stake my career on this. You are. He did it. sh1t. He did. You have to go to the D.A. I'm going to Daniel. Who's not doing their job like a man now? I'm giving him the courtesy of explaining himself. You shouldn't. What you do if it were me? [Knocking door ] Hi. Hey. Come in. Oh. Thanks. Oh... Are those for me, probably? Yeah. That's a thing, right? Uh, bringing flowers for the roommate of the girl you're taking... you're just gonna take one of those, okay. Who's gonna tell her? You? Lieutenant Weinberg? That's from A Few Good Men. Yeah. Yeah. I get HBO. [Mouthing words] I love you! Uh, Nikki is gonna be out any minute, so-- Am I dressed okay, for her? [mouthing words] Yeah, uh, you look fine. Good? Yeah. Would--can you me the truth? You don't want the truth. "'Cause deep down in places you don't [together] "talk about at parties, you want me "on that wall, you  need  me on that wall--" Hey, Nikki. Hi. Uh, wow. Those look beautiful. Ohuh, yeah--um, so--so, do you. So they- I'm gonna go put these in water. Okay. [Whispering] You liar. Look at her. You did want to look perfect on your first date. Yeah, I do. Ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Are... are you ready? Yeah. Then we, ready. For dinner. Everyone's ready, isn't that great? - Good Night. That great? Something I can help you with? Yon help me understand why you've been stealing from our clients. Jessica, I can-- Oh, God damn Daniel. It was for Alicia. She's dying. What? Breast cancer. Stage four. Why didn't you say anything? She found a lump a year ago. It was the worst day of our lives. I have no words. I thought I could handle it myself. And the money? Treatments. Not covered by insurance. Why not? They're not in the books. But I don't care. She's not dying because I didn't spend the money. You stole $1/2 million. I don't expect you to forgive me. What do you expect? I honestly don't know. Wild Maine salmon, braised fennel mushroom polenta, arugula salad, and do you really need to keep doing this? U really are a genius. Sexy, right? What'd you get on your SATs? Ooh, 1590. Yeah, it was an ambiguous question, I don't know. I really don't like to talk about it. Oh, no, no, no. Here, let me get that, c'mon. Parents' plastic. They're cool. Cool. Listen, um... Why don't we go back to your place, cause I'm live in Brooklyn, and I kinda in a strange roommate situation-- I want to pay you $1000 to take the LSATs for me. Oh. What? That's why you snaked me from Jenny. I don't know what you're talking about. Unbelievable. We're not all born geniuses. And I need your help. Yeah, you might not be a genius, but you know exactly what you're doing. And you're not getting my help. Come on. What do you want? Oh, I don't want anything. Because I'm not your trained monkey. Tell your mommy thanks for dinner. Grammy! Oh my God, what's the matter? Bob, what happened? Relax, Mike. Edith's fine, I'm just gonna go get her a glass of water. Grammy, here, look at me. What happened? I don't know. I think the floor was wet. The floor was wet, how did the floor get wet? Well, it happened fast. But I'm okay. But, what are you doing here? I thought you had a date. Uh, it di... no, it didn't work out. So, you came to see your grandmother. That's not normal, Michael. Rea--are we gonna do this, right now? Hey. Thank you, Bob, I really appreciate it. That's what neighbors are for. Here, you drink that, and we'll be right back. Okay? For what it's worth... Uh-huh. [Whispering] The floor wasn't wet. You know, if I were you, I'd get full-time care for Edith. Are you crazy? Did you hear me? His wife's dying of cancer. So you're going to let him walk? No, nobody's walking. The firm's taking out a loan against its assets. Daniel will pay it back. Great. My dad has gout, can I have $1 million? Coldhearted son of a bitch. You know those Tuesday lunches at the Harvard Club? He's taking Alicia to chemo. He stole from our clients, which means he's stealing from us. When it was Louis, you were ready to break him down and crack him open. Daniel is the reason why I'm here. He plucked me from the bullpen when I didn't know my ass from my elbow. He saw a star to hitch his wagon to. This is Manhattan, Harvey. How many black women do you see with their name on the door? You know what, he was smart to put your name first. That way you might not notice that you'd always be number two. Careful, Harvey. Then again, maybe you're okay staying number two--Scottie Pippen... Don't pull that sh1t on me. We made a deal, and I honored it. It's time for you to honor it. Wow, a man's wife's dying, and the first words out of your mouth are "you owe me." Who's the bad guy now? [Clears throat] You asked me what it's gonna take. It's gonna take $5,000. Keep your voice down. Why, am I making you nervous? Yes. Good. Now you know how I'm gonna feel. You're asking me to expose myself so that you can go make a fortune. So either you figure out how to pay me, or you roll the dice on your own. But trust me when I tell you, these tests aren't easy. Well, they are for me. Okay. Good. What made you change your mind? None of your business. You're not Monica. Oh, no, I'm-- Rachel Zane. How did you know that? I'm Donna. I know everything. Everything? You started three months ago, you have a peach yogurt every morning, you've got a cute pair of suede pumps I totally plan on stealing, and your father's Robert Zane, name partner at Rand, Kaldor, and Zane. And, apparently, you don't like people knowing who your dad is. Well, they just... they treat you differently. Your secret's safe with me. No, it doesn't really matter. I won't be here that long. It is the cafeteria? Because it is  way  better than it used to be. Nope. I live for foie gras Fridays. They don't have that. Don't they? You're weird. We'll be friends. Anyway, I should go. I'm just gonna leave this stuff here for Monica. She should be back pretty soon. She just has Tuesday pilates at Chelsea Pier. Every Tuesday? Now, I thought you knew everything. I do. What are you so bouncy about? You're gonna be so happy that I listen to your intercom. [Doorbell rings] Who is it? Room service. What are you doing here? Delivering champagne. I see you can afford it since the money you've been stealing from our clients hasn't been going to your wife's cancer treatments. Hey, Monica, how's it going? Harvey. Daniel and I need a minute. Letter of resignation. You're gonna sign it, and then name Jessica as your successor. I don't think so. Unflinching in the face of defeat. It's not defeat. You come after me for embezzlement, every Pearson Hardman client you've got is gone. Which is why Jessica won't let me do that. Then why are you here? Waiting for your wife. What are you talking about? She's invited to a fund raiser. She'll be at the front desk in three minutes. You don't sign, they'll send her up to this room. You do sign, they'll send her to another room. You dragged a woman racked with cancer here to blackmail me? You think it's me she's gonna have issue with? You goddamn b*st*rd. Says the man cheating on his dying wife. You don't know anything. I do. I've seen you with her, and I know you love her. And this has nothing to do with that. I also know that you don't want the rest of Alicia's life spent picturing this. If she wasn't sick, she could probably get over it. She's not getting any better, Daniel. You have two minutes. It's your call. [Knock on door] There's something I think you should know. Please. Mike Ross had lunch with Monica Eton today. I saw him hand her a filing. And why do you think this concerns me? I just think that their meeting on the eve of the firm's vote suggests that Jessica's making a move. You've been good to me since you've been back. She hasn't. Do what you will. About time. I wasn't sure you'd make it. Especially since you didn't give me a reason. I've got about 5,000 reasons. We'll be fine. Oh, my God, you're high. I'm fine. Are you crazy? I'm about to do something illegal, okay? It helps calm me down. Great, you'll be calm. How the hell are you gonna handle the test? I don't know, maybe the same way I handled your little quiz the other night. You were high. And drunk. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a test to take. And I've gotta miss a couple of questions on purpose. It's done. Hardman's gone. Harvey... What is it? I don't know how to say this. Just say it, Donna. What? Your dad... he had a heart attack. Harvey, I'm so sorry. It's okay. [Quietly, voice quivering] Oh, my God. Good morning, Monica. Jessica. You look tired. Did you get much rest last night? I want to explain. I'm not here for excuses. Then why are you here? To see you off. My relationship with Daniel has nothing to do with my work here. I need to know I can trust my people. You're not my people. You can't fire me. I'll sue for wrongful termination. Which will lead me to implicate you in Daniel's crimes. I had nothing to do with that. Didn't you? Diamond earrings, diamond bracelet, and trips to, let's see now... Mexico...France... Hong Kong. Hope you liked that one. I didn't know. I don't care. You are a Harvard-educated lawyer. Do you think that a jury will believe you had no idea where that money came from? Don't do this. Louis will accept your resignation, and I will never see you here again. I expected a fight, but not a dirty one. I don't know what you're talking about. Mike Ross met with Monica Eton. And what does that have to do with me? I am disappointed that you felt the need to go there. I'm disappointed you think I did. You really expect me to believe that you didn't-- Stop right there! You know, you might fight dirty, and Harvey might fight dirty, but I don't. What the hell are you doing? Trying to get Monica Eton to file a sexual harassment suit against Daniel Hardman? Okay she left because of their affair, which he paid for with embezzled money. That was five years ago. And her life fell apart! I know you think you're trying to help me, but drop it, immediately. Wow. That's what all this was about? Nice performance. I'm trying to help Jessica. Mike, you cannot keep me in the dark. Not when you're the one asking me for help. Couldn't take the chance that you wouldn't help. You told me it was about one of Monica's old cases. You lied like it's second nature. Our backs are against the wall. I did what I had to do. And you're proud of that? Rachel, sometimes you have to cross a line to do the right thing. Wow... Harvey has really rubbed off on you. I didn't learn that from Harvey. Heh. Holy sh1t, dude. Pays to be a nerd. Yeah, but you still don't get the girls. I don't know, I guess I'm gonna use this to get my grandma some help. Too bad it was a one-time-only deal. Actually, she has three friends who want to use my services, so... Oh, good. We're in business. 'Cause you're gonna need to start paying all the rent around here. What? Oh, did you think you were the only one stepping up his game? Meaning? [Chuckles] What? Trevor, no, no, no. Not a good idea. No. Which is why I'm moving out. Unless you want in, in which case, you know, I'm still moving out. But we could go together... move into a much, much nicer apartment. [Knock on door] That's Jenny. First date. Could you not tell her about this? Go get the door. Unbelievable. [Sighs] Jenny. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. Daniel came in last night to pick up his things. Threw a phone at my head. You duck, or is his aim that bad? He throws like a girl. I'm not surprised. You needed me? I wanted you to be the first to know. We have a new partner. Andrew McCutcheon. Solid candidate. A simple thank you would suffice. Me thank you? Never. Well, I have a partners meeting in five minutes. I'm gonna break the news that I'm taking Daniel's office. Who's taking yours? I'm looking at him. Jessica... Thank you. One last tip. Don't let Louis in here after hours. Finally an office big enough for your balls. Okay, I am not touching that one. You would if you had bigger balls. Hold on a sec, did you listen on Jessica's intercom? No. She told me. Before me? Well, I was the one to figure it out about Daniel. Oh, and how did she know that? Let's just focus on what's important. You just made partner. We just made partner. I'll grab the can opener. Whoa, whoa, that's pre-trial ritual. We're making an exception. I'll get the thumbtacks. Two dozen? Three dozen. Ooh, going for the record! Zoe. Harvey. Is word out already? Word about what? Oh, don't be coy. I just made partner. You're here to congratulate me. I knew it. It was Hardman, wasn't it? What do you want me to say? Nothing. I know how it is around here. Secrets and lies... standard procedure. I didn't build the sandbox, Zoe. No, you just like to play in it. And you don't? No. And I don't like watching what it's doing to a man I care about. Zoe-- I'm leaving. Today's my last day. Because of this? Look, I did what I did for the good of the firm. You think that's what I'm talking about? Do you know what this is? It's my condolences, which I expected to leave on your desk, because I thought you'd be out mourning your father. I had-- What, bigger fish to fry? Don't you see? That's what this place does. There's always bigger fish. I am dealing how I deal. Harvey, you've lost your way. How'd it go yesterday? Fine. Mike pull it off? Yep. He suspect you were in on it? Nope. Well, now they know. Gonna swing us some votes. We threw Daniel's ass out once, we'll do it again. Damn right. One more thing. I'm getting Donna back.
