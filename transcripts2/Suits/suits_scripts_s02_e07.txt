 So you did have the document from Coastal Motors? 
 Objection. 
 Harvey, you're the defendant. 
 I wasn't objecting to his question. 
 Just his tie. 
 I do have to look at it, you know. 
 This is fun, isn't it, Harv? 
 Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud. 
 I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud. 
 There was no fraud. What? 
 You just said, you had the document. 
 Yes. We went back through the case files. 
 Found the report. Whoops. 
 That's it. "Whoops"? 
 [Laughs] 
 Hope, you got that. "Whoops"? Your defense is "whoops"? 
 All right, you've made your point. 
 You made us a settlement offer that we would never take. 
 Let's talk about one that we would. 
 This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting. 
 Every meeting is a settlement meeting. 
 Fine. 
 The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred. 
 How about $100 million? 
 And Harvey gets disbarred. 
 Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead. 
 I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway. 
 You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you? 
 You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle. 
 If that's a sticking point, I might be able to go to 0 million. 
 But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred. 
 I think I'm doing you a favor. 
 And what does he... cause a headache like this once, twice a month? 
 Doesn't matter, into my case last year, and he beat you. 
 Crushed him. 
 Then he took his ball and went home. 
 Should've stayed there. 
 Look at that. 
 Finishing each other's sentences. 
 How cute. 
 No wonder you won't throw him under the bus. 
 Good for you, Harvey. 
 I mean, you're throwing her under the bus. 
 Watch yourself, Tanner. 
 Oh, what's the matter, Harv? 
 Did I offend your delicate sensibilities? 
 You want to take your ball and go home? 
 I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your... Harvey. 
 Of course. 
 Your coifed hair, your pretty nails. 
 See? She's the man, and you're the girl. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 You know, it's funny. 
 I would have thought she'd prefer someone like-- 
 This deposition is over. 
 Now what? Is mommy gonna take you home now? 
 Wait. That's it. 
 You got a thing for mommy. 
 And now it all makes sense. 
 Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging-- 
 [Blow thuds] 
 [Groans] 
 [People murmuring] 
 Point, Tanner. 
 I'll see you in court, Harv. 
 So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face? 
 He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other. 
 [Blows] 
 That's funny. 
 But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial. 
 It won't. 
 Not if you're prepared. 
 Are you suggesting a trial run? 
 I don't want a trial at all but-- 
 We already know your position is to cut me loose. 
 Not you. No. 
 I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think. 
 And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel? 
 You're betting everything on this trial. 
 Better make damn sure you can win. 
 He's an asshole. 
 He's right. 
 All right, what? 
 If we're gonna do this, I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner. 
 Are you saying I'm rusty? 
 When was the last time you were in the ring? 
 We don't need a good Tanner. 
 We need a nasty Tanner. 
 Someone who will do anything to beat me. 
 Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face. 
 [Giggling] 
 Oh, you want me to do what? 
 I just told you four times. 
 I want you to play Tanner. No, no, no. 
 I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading. 
 Can you just repeat it one more time? 
 Look, Louis, you've had your fun. 
 When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game, I was talking about the trial. 
 I know what you're talking about. 
 You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot. 
 No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one. 
 I'm the man for the job, and you know it. 
 Actually, I had you at number five on my list. 
 And what did Jessica have me at? 
 Six. 
 Okay. I get it. I get it. 
 You're trying to make me mad. 
 No, I'm trying to make you good. 
 You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me. 
 That is true. 
 But what you don't have are his skills. 
 But that's okay. I'll go to somebody else. 
 Wait, Harvey. Stop. 
 You don't think I can win? 
 I know you can't. 
 This isn't some bank loan, junior. 
 Get out. 
 I've got a trial to prepare for. 
 And you know what? 
 When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground. 
 Good. 
 Because those are the real ground rules. 
 Oh, I see. 
 Now, you're asking to get lit up.

 Has Donna called back? 
 She would be red, so... 
 No. 
 Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit. 
 Call her again. Yes. 
 So? 
 How was it? 
 How was what? 
 Punching Tanner. 
 It was awesome, wasn't it? Tell me it was awesome. 
 What are you, in middle school? 
 I'm in the middle of a trial. A mock trial. 
 Mock trials are for children. 
 The adults are doing an in-house trial run. 
 [Chuckles] Okay. Mock trial, trial run. 
 Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato. 
 What do you need me to do? 
 What he needs you to do is help me. 
 What's this? 
 You've been drafted. 
 Okay, what round? 
 Excuse me? 
 Sports metaphor. 
 Oh, it's not tennis. Sports. 
 You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial. 
 Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Wait, what judge? 
 His honor, Daniel Hardman. 
 I'll see you in court, sweet tits. 
 No, no. He can't. 
 He can. 
 I'm not-- 
 You are. 
 Harvey-- 
 Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent. 
 You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful. 
 Now is not the time to quote  The Breakfast Club. 
 Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn. 
 Stop it. This trial is no joke. 
 Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali. 
 She better be able to beat Joe Frazier. 
 Louis is no Joe Frazier. Okay. I get it. 
 You want me to help Louis think outside the box. 
 Exactly. Now, how would you come after me? 
 Well, first of all-- 
 Don't tell me, tell Louis. 
 Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial. 
 Oh, and you were right. 
 I know. About what? 
 Tanner. It was awesome. 
 Guess you're not going to let me win. 
 Have I ever? 
 Would I know? 
 Doubtful. 
 Have you ever? I am right now. 
 Rule number 27: 
 Never beat the person you're trying to close. 
 I always hated rule number 27. 
 You couldn't close me five years ago. 
 What makes you think you've got a shot tonight? 
 Didn't. 
 Not couldn't. 
 And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services I was interested in. 
 How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult? 
 She's onboard. 
 Do you mean I have to convince her? 
 See that? 
 That's why I want you. 
 You could've told me all this on the phone. 
 Well, I wanted to see you first. 
 Make sure things weren't... awkward. 
 You know, because-- 
 "I didn't call you back five years ago"? 
 Oops. 
 You think you didn't call me back five years ago? 
 Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago. 
 Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory. 
 I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. 
 Because you know I'm right. 
 Because I'm a bigger person. 
 Which is why I'm gonna come in. 
 But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips? 
 Why do you think? 
 They had the document. 
 They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it. 
 These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed. 
 [Sighs] 
 Aren't you supposed to be over there? 
 You know, I'm just working on something for work. Yeah. 
 And just quoting  A Few Good Men. 
 For work. 
 I know. 
 Look, I, um... 
 I have to ask you. 
 Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it? 
 No, I don't. 
 How do you know? 
 Because I know Harvey. 
 I mean, how could you think he could do it? 
 Because I don't know Harvey. 
 All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win. 
 Yeah, but that doesn't mean... you don't think he has integrity. 
 Ah. Sorry, I have to go. 
 Oh, Mike. 
 What happens to you if Harvey loses? 
 I don't know. 
 But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing. 
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray. 
 You either are or you aren't. 
 And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document. 
 It's a good opening. It's not good enough. 
 Says his lap dog. 
 Says the guy who knows how to beat him. 
 [Exhales] 
 I'm listening. 
 How? 
 Don't play the odds. Play the man. 
 Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner? 
 No. 
 He threatened to commit perjury to win. 
 Of course, it's classic Harvey. 
 He was bluffing. 
 But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him. 
 What's your point? 
 My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity. 
 Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity. 
 So then use that against him. 
 Easier said than done. Thanks. 
 Yeah. No, you're right. 
 Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone. 
 Then use that to get ahead. 
 I did not use it for that reason. 
 Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch. 
 How dare you-- 
 Shut up. You know it. 
 I know it. Everybody knows it. 
 I did what I did for the integrity of the firm. 
 Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm? 
 Daniel had a right to know. 
 And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him. 
 You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you. 
 He was there when I heard it. 
 He asked, I told him. 
 Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret? 
 No, he didn't. 
 So then you volunteered it. 
 Which is as good as seeking it out. 
 Devious. You weren't there. 
 You don't know. You're twisting what happened. 
 Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey. 
 [Distant siren wailing] 
 How long have you been waiting? 
 How long were you gonna ignore my calls? 
 Last I checked, you haven't called. 
 I've left you ten voicemails in the last week. 
 Huh, that's so weird. 
 I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails. 
 You know I don't know how to dial out. 
 Is it eight? Is it nine? 
 Do you know how to use your cell phone? 
 Because if I were your assistant, I would have totally programmed my phone number into it. 
 Oh, wait. 
 [Snaps fingers] 
 I did. When I was your assistant. 
 Okay, look. I'm an asshole. 
 Did you come here to tell me things I already know? 
 No, I came here to see how you're doing. 
 You came to get me to do the trial run. 
 Donna, it's important. 
 Yeah, important for me to get up there and say I screwed up trying to protect you? 
 You did screw up. 
 Yes. To protect you. 
 Which I never asked you to do. 
 No, you just expected me to do it. 
 Like I expected you to fight for me. 
 I did. 
 Really? 
 Like you fought for Mike? 
 Because that fight, you somehow managed to win. 
 Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself. 
 Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go. 
 And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too? 
 Donna, I need you there. 
 I need you to tell them that I didn't do this. 
 I'm sorry, I can't. 
 I've hired an attorney. 
 If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth. 
 So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer," because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway. 
 Donna. 
 I decline to answer. 
 Really? Really? 
 You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people. 
 She's the me of jury consulting. 
 Don't sell me short, Harvey. I'm trying to close a deal here. 
 What kind of jury would you pick? 
 I already did. You need men. 
 That's a mistake. Women love me. 
 Really? 
 Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky... 
 Oh, and arrogant again. 
 What about handsome? 
 Did I not mention arrogant? 
 It's not bragging if it's true. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Zoe, I'm still not convinced I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips. 
 After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips. 
 Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips? 
 I can do what Ted can't. 
 Hardman came back. You're in his chair. 
 He doesn't like that. You told her? 
 I didn't have to. 
 The partners don't know what to think. 
 We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent. 
 We need to convince them I'm innocent. 
 Because if they don't trust Harvey... 
 They don't trust me. 
 And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win. 
 She's worked here. She knows the other partners. 
 She can read them. 
 And I also know Hardman. 
 I never liked him. 
 I won't tell Hardman what I tell you. 
 Welcome back, Zoe. 
 Please state your name. 
 Harvey Specter. 
 Your full name. 
 Harvey Reginald Specter. 
 [Silently] 
 Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter? 
 Of course not. 
 Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a... ooh, what was his name? 
 Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt. 
 That was a prank. 
 It was a one-time thing. 
 So you didn't do anything wrong? 
 I don't think so. 
 And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it? Yes. 
 Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 What was done was done. "What was done was done." 
 And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right? 
 Yes. 
 Ah. Was it? 
 Because I think maybe this is a pattern. 
 Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong. 
 Your Honor, he's testifying. 
 Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today. 
 Except there's one big difference. 
 Your Honor-- 
 This time... 
 A man was killed. 
 No further questions, Your Honor. 
 What's done is done, right? 
 [Laughs] 
 The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen. 
 Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document? 
 I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights. 
 So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence? 
 Objection. 
 You can't object. 
 Jessica will. 
 Could you just... 
 Sorry. Yeah. 
 Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job? 
 I do. 
 Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city? 
 Mike, you can't. 
 Donna, I can. 
 Yes. 
 Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding. 
 Was it yours? I decline to answer. 
 Did it look like your date stamp? 
 I decline to answer. 
 Okay. Then let me ask you this. 
 Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it? 
 I decline to answer. 
 And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss? 
 This is gonna be bad, isn't it? 
 Donna's gonna be great. Just follow the script. 
 Well, Rachel's not Donna. 
 She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled. 
 You see how I rattled Harvey? 
 The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear. 
 And we don't have that... 
 Yet. 
 What's this? 
 Subpoena. 
 You want to depose me? 
 Okay, let's stop playing  tiptoe through the tulips 
 around the elephant in the room. 
 That's not a thing. 
 You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too. 
 You yourself said go after the man. 
 What better way to go after the man than to question the boy? 
 But I don't know anything about this case. 
 That's an evasive answer, Mike. 
 You're hiding something, and I smell fear. 
 I have to go to the restroom. 
 Wait a minute. How bad is it? 
 Is it uncomfortable? Well, now it is. 
 Good. 
 What. Whoa, whoa. 
 Is that a polygraph? 
 Yes. 
 Nope. 
 You are under oath. 
 And I'll tell the truth. 
 You bet your ass you will, or I'll know. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 We'll start with an easy one. 
 What's your name? 
 Mike Ross. 
 Where do you work? 
 Pearson Hardman. 
 What do you do for a living? 
 I practice law. 
 And where did you attend law school? 
 What? What's the matter? 
 Nothing. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You're lying. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I beg to differ. 
 Listen to me. 
 I know why the machine says you're lying. 
 You're nervous. 
 You don't want to rat out Harvey. 
 I get that. 
 But it's time you accept the situation. 
 This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey. 
 I accept that. 
 Then answer the goddamn question. 
 I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law. 
 Now it's time that you accept the situation. 
 I'm not afraid of you. 
 I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case. 
 Do you want fear? 
 I'll get you Donna. 
 The answer's no. 
 I didn't even ask a question yet. 
 Yeah, well you were going to. 
 Yeah. 
 And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes. 
 Oh. That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey. 
 And you, my dear, are not... Are not Harvey. 
 No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't. 
 You know that I... 
 Broke your promise. 
 Well, then I guess I just suck. 
 Because I'm breaking another one right now. 
 I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over. 
 You hired an attorney? 
 Yeah. 
 I'd rather not go to jail. 
 I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange. 
 Nobody's going to jail, Donna. 
 You can't guarantee that. 
 You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you scold me about how much he loves his job. 
 Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again. 
 That is not fair. 
 No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake. 
 You know what, do whatever your attorney wants. 
 Come in. Don't come in. Go to the movies. 
 Take pilates. I don't give a sh1t. 
 Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
 Complainant would like to call Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand. 
 
 
 
 Sidebar? 
 This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury. 
 What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good? 
 You're a named defendant. 
 He has a right to call you. 
 Louis, will you excuse us for a moment? 
 You think I don't see what you're trying to do? 
 You want him to undermine me in front of the partners. 
 I'm acting in an unbiased manner. 
 It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here. 
 Oh, wait, you never jumped in. 
 Jessica, you chose to try this case. 
 You could have been up here. Instead, you're down there. 
 Either take a knee or take that stand. 
 Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman? 
 You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing. 
 What about Mr. Specter? How's his track record? 
 Exceptional. He almost always wins. 
 Almost always. 
 Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history? 
 It's a factor. 
 And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win? 
 I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures. 
 And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young? 
 No. 
 Mm. 
 No, he wouldn't have. 
 How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner? 
 Oh, it's too soon to say. 
 He hasn't received his first bonus yet. 
 Ballpark. 
 No. 
 Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him? 
 No. 
 Well, then answer the question. 
 Millions. 
 And a junior partner makes? 
 Much less. 
 So win, and you're rewarded millions. 
 Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing. 
 Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win. 
 I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company. 
 Don't be too hard on yourself. You're not mediocre. 
 See, that's funny, because you were talking about me. 
 There it is, the Specter smile. 
 What can I say? It came with the name. 
 And you're never fully dressed without a smile. 
 Being fully dressed is overrated. 
 It is when you look like me. 
 Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me? 
 Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson? 
 Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft. 
 Anne Bancroft was hot. 
 Which brings me to second of all. 
 I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft. 
 I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman. 
 Not in  Tootsie. 
 [Laughs] [Laughs] Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing? No. You should be. Why, because Louis had one good direct? You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you. I don't always walk. Sometimes I drive fast. And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass. Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud. If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do? Well, why don't you tell me? You're the expert on warm and fuzzies. You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back? Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back. Let me guess... you didn't like me. No, I did. But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability. I told you how I felt about you. But you never showed me. So I had no way of knowing it's the truth. And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either. What do you want me to do? Manufacture a few tears? Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you. There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you. The plaintiff would like to call Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand. You got her to come in? Just stick to the script. Harvey won't know what hit him. Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document? I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights. Did you put your date stamp on that document? I decline to answer. Um... I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so... Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you? He wouldn't ask me to do that. That's not what I asked. If he did, would you do it? Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something. No, I'm not. See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why. Is there a question? Do you love Harvey Specter? What? Do you love him? That has nothing to do with-- It has everything to do with. Why did your last boyfriend break up with you? Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you? He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship. Your work? He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he? Yes. Who did you choose? Harvey. Because you love him? Louis, stop. It is not that simple. Do you love him, yes or no? Answer the question. Louis. You're with him all the time. Your work revolves around him. Your life revolves around him. Objection, badgering. You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him. Your Honor! Please, I just need a-- Do you love Harvey Specter? Do you love Harvey Specter? That's enough! Donna. You crossed the line. Do not do this to me right now. You humiliated Donna. You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun? What, you think I enjoyed that? That made me sick. You could have stopped. You think Tanner would have stopped? Travis Tanner does not give a sh1t about Donna Paulsen. You are not Travis Tanner. I don't-- You did not have to do that. I did my job. You really want to beat me that badly, huh? You think this is about beating you? This whole thing is about saving you. Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up. This is all your fault. And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there... that's on you... not me. Are you kidding me? Go home. Shoo! Go the hell home. Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that. And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently? I am so sorry. Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. Okay. Donna, I'm not... Harvey. I know. But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are. [Chuckles] And I do not mean that as a compliment. Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all. Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey. We had a script. Wait, you trusted Louis? You trusted Louis? Yeah, I thought he would stick to it. Yes. Well, he didn't. And you should have known that, because that is just who he is. I am sorry. But I'm-- [chuckles] People are who they are. Thank you. Okay. I can fix this! What's all this? It wouldn't concern you. Why is that? Because you want to settle even if it means Harvey getting disbarred. If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway. My concern is for the firm. It's not a personal attack against Harvey. This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey. And you're gonna do something about it? Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions. I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am. What are you planning on doing with it? Leveraging that for a settlement? I'm not against settling. I'm against Harvey getting disbarred. You really admire him. I do. Loyalty. You can't buy that. No. You can't. What are you doing? We worked together all night once. Let's do it again. I hope this time turns out better than the last time. Now we have them right where we want them. Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey. Why? Because he protected Donna. He was also protecting himself. [Scoffs] Yes. But they didn't see that. They saw a man who cared about someone else. His softer side. And we need to give them more. He won't want to. And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do. Everybody knows that. So what do we do? Permission to treat the witness as hostile. Permission granted. He's hostile. The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm. I don't recall that day. Well, let me refresh your memory. An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage. You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A. I don't like fraud. It's no secret. But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me. Why? I didn't want to get in trouble. No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension. And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared. Whatever you say. You pretend like you don't care, but you do. You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients. But you refuse to let people know. Is there a question? I just want to know why. No answer? Are you embarrassed? Nope. Afraid? No. Then why? Just let it go. You are under oath. Then hold me in contempt. For God sakes, what the hell happened to you? What kind of damage was done to you? Caring only makes you... Weak. They think you care, they'll walk all over you. You weren't weak the day you walked into my office. You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win. And you still are. And I've never seen anyone walk all over you. Is there a question here, Your Honor? No, there isn't. That whole thing your idea? I didn't know that story. I asked you a question. Don't give me that coy bullshit. Excuse me? You said you wanted to see through me, you did. The least you can do is give me an honest answer. Yes, it was my idea. Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there. You're gonna win. Bravo. A tour de force. I mean, that story? It was so great. But there isn't one shred of proof it's true. Hostile witness, my ass. I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it. And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook? That's my close. We have one more witness to call. Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter? It's complicated. No, it's simple. Do you resent him for being better than you? He's not better than me. I understand. It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings. Shortcomings? Mm. My billables are higher than his. My client list is better than his. Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things. What are you asking, Ms. Pearson? Does the witness resent my client? Yes. Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner? Yes or no? Yes. Do you think he's an excellent attorney? Yes. And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud? No. Defense rests. Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat. You really are like Harvey. I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Well, who would you rather be? Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win. Like I said, Harvey. Yeah. Not in this case. You both cheated. Excuse me? Louis's testimony pushed it over the top. But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence... they saw Travis Tanner. And that is never gonna happen in court. You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner. [Sighs] With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred. We'll find a way to win. You should be finding a way to settle. There isn't an acceptable offer. Yet. Not just a pretty face. I hope you brought a baseball bat. You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it. It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway. Boohoo. You baited me. You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it. That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it. You want to settle? Let me save you some time. We pass. You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting. This gets me off the hook. Nice try. You think I don't know this was your doing? Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy. Errand boy? You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb. Daniel Hardman doesn't work you. You work him. What the hell did you do? This is a good deal. A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000. Including me. We share the profits; We share the losses. There won't be a loss when I win this at trial. The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment. That's gone. And I want to know how you made it go away. I found dirt on Tanner. What dirt? You blackmailed him into a settlement. I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm. I said, "what dirt?" Not your concern. It's my concern. I don't want what you did biting me in the ass. You were already bitten. And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass. You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm. We both know that's what you wanted. Time to move on. Let's let the partners put this to a vote. Hardman got Tanner to settle. Are you kidding? [Laughs] It worked? So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal. No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner. Box. Me. [Laughs] You're welcome. I didn't thank you. It's okay. You don't have to. And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal. Because you don't trust Daniel. This isn't just about me. Every partner is... everybody is paying now. Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify? Because I convinced her to. What? Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted. I did what you do. And look where that's gotten us, you, me, Jessica, Louis, everybody. Take the deal, Harvey. What did Hardman find in those files? I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook. He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now. No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money. [Scoffs] And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you. This is your decision. So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling? Thank you. Now all those in favor of going to trial. Split vote. And it appears we have a holdout. I vote we settle. Let the record show we have settled. Thank you for your time. In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise. This lawsuit has caused some of you to question Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership. Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm. Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote: Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
