 IRIS: We don't know what happened.   
 It had to have been someone else.   
 Silas isn't a murderer.   
 FELIX: Iris...   
 It's not possible.   
 HUCK: We've seen him lose it before.   
 He was drunk. Blacked out.    
 He woke up covered in blood.    
 Their blood...    
 He could've stumbled on them just like us.    
 He told us that he doesn't remember, and I believe him.    
 All right? I do.    
 But we have to look at the hard facts.    
 He was angry. He didn't like Percy...    
 [BREATHING SHAKILY]    
 ♪♪    
 Tony and Percy were grifters.    
 They must've had enemies.    
 What if someone that they ripped off came back for revenge?    
 HUCK: Turned this whole place upside down.    
 There's no evidence anybody else was in here.    
 Strangers would've taken their sh1t.    
 He was passed out at the scene, his wrench covered in Tony's blood.    
 HOPE: I don't wanna believe it, either.    
 All right? It's the last thing I wanna believe.    
 But Huck said it.    
 We have seen Silas lose it before.    
 Hope, come on.    
 We've heard the stories about his dad.    
 You're all acting like 
we don't know him.    
 Silas is our friend. 
He has earned our trust.    
 There has to be some other explanation.    
 Wild animals. Marauders, even. I...    
 What about Percy?    
 We never found his body.    
 What if he's alive and he needs our help?    
 Yes, yes. He could tell us what really happened.    
 We searched, okay? We did.    
 For hours.    
 We found a trail of blood that stopped at the river.    
 I mean, even if he was still alive... there's no way he could fight that current.    
 But why would Silas attack the people who were trying to help us?    
 I don't know.    
 I think I know why.

 This is so messed up.     
 It's just a couple drawings.     
 Iris, you threw these away.     
 He dug through our trash...     
 He was a janitor. It was his job.     
 Exactly.     
 It doesn't have to mean anything.     
 It doesn't, but it might.     
 He likes you, Iris.     
 He was different with you.     
 We all saw that.     
 Maybe he saw that you were different with Percy.     
 No, I wasn't. He wasn't...     
 They were in his bag. 
We should put them back.     
 Why?     
 Iris may not have wanted those drawings, but Silas did.     
 All we have is what we carry on our backs.     
 Obviously, Silas thought Iris's work was important enough to bring with him.     
 We have no right to take that away.

 Empty stars.     
 Their light carrying on across millions of miles of space after they're gone.     
 It's a graveyard up there.

 We'd be able to tell if they were in the early stages of death.

 How are you doing with everything?     
 Oh.     
 I've been thinking, too.     
 I've been operating under a false assumption.     
 I mean, there are no laws out here, and as such, nothing specifically empowers the adults to decide Silas's fate.

 HOPE: Are we leaving already?     
 I have come to a very difficult decision.     
 I'm leaving to join Silas.     
 His odds of survival increase dramatically with supplies and somebody watching his back.     
 You can't. That's crazy.     
 If I don't go after him,     
 Silas will spend the rest of his life thinking that nobody believes in him.     
 He'll spend the rest of his life believing a lie.     
 I just...     
 I can't let that happen.     
 You'll give my best to the others?     
 It's going to be too hard to say goodbye, so...     
 I-I'd rather not.     
 You're serious.     
 You're really leaving.     
 We could never see you again.     
 What about our family?     
 Silas is family, too.     
 Everything happens the way it's supposed to.     
 And I think I'm supposed to find him.     
 And then I think I'm supposed to find my mother and my sister, too.     
 - Elton... 
- Look, I-I thought it was crazy, but you were right.     
 They could still be out there.     
 It's just like my father's triceratops horn.     
 - If I could... 
- But what if they're not?     
 Not what?     
 [SNIFFLES]     
 I lied to you, Elton.     
 I thought I was protecting you from the truth,     
 - but I made it worse. 
- I don't understand.     
 You can't keep looking for someone that's not there.

 The Night the Sky Fell, I was with my mom.     
 There was a woman with a gun.     
 [SNIFFLES] I didn't know it until I saw the picture in the book, but... it was your mom.     
 And she was scared.     
 My mom tried to calm her down, and I jumped between them, and the gun went off and my mom...  she died.     
 I don't know if your mom meant to do it, but she dropped the gun, and I picked it up.     
 I didn't know what to do, so I pointed it at her and it went off in my hand.

 MAN: Lieutenant Colonel, we have eyes.     
 Good. Bring her in.     
 She's late, but she made it.     
 She did.     
 This far at least.     
 It'll only get harder on this side of the Mississippi River.     
 She's aware. So am I.     
 With respect, I just wonder     
 - if there isn't an easier way to... 
- There isn't.     
 We know there isn't because she's the one who was on the ground, watching and listening and doing the very hard thing of becoming someone else to find out there isn't.     
 She knows it's dangerous.     
 She knows she could die. They both could.     
 She's out here risking everything because there's no easier way.
