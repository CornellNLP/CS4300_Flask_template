 When did that happen?    
 Couple days ago.    
 We'd gone to this settlement we heard was friendly to newcomers.    
 We heard wrong.    
 Maybe they just didn't like you.    
 Left in a hurry, found a place to camp down, fell asleep.    
 When I woke up, they were gone, and so was my stuff.    
 Guess they finally agreed on something.    
 That's why I'm here.

 I'm just praying for some sort of shelter so I can wait out the storm.     
 That's when I hear 'em.     
 Moans so load you could feel the vibrations in the show.

 So, what did you do?

 Nothin'.     
 I opened my eyes.     
 It's a herd of bison.

 It was the most beautiful thing I ever seen.

 Geez! That's wild.

 Wait.     
 You saw the bison that winter?     
 How'd you get from Wyoming to Florida in a couple months?

 'Bout a year ago, I saw a truck that had skidded onto the ice.     
 Must've just happened, because the engine was still running, and the... the driver was going from, you know,     
 "once was" to has-been.     
 SILAS: Why'd you lie?     
 Coulda just told us they stole your car.

 That's kinda cynical. I don't take you for a cynic.     
 No, you take me for everything I'm worth.     
 Know what the worst part is?     
 I really thought I had good instincts.     
 You do.     
 You came back up those stairs to help me.     
 See, I... I've probably run this grift a dozen times, and people always take the keys and run.     
 But you didn't.

 If you'd let me.     
 You would?     
 Yeah, absolutely.     
 I might be the only person left in the world who saw her, who knew her. But... at least now someone else will know her, too.

 We need to talk.     
 As we say in my business, we got ourselves a setup, but no punch line.     
 We both want the truck, but only I know where to get more fuel.     
 This isn't as much of a conversation as it is, what?

 My nephew promised you a ride, and I intend to make good on that. But first,

 Found something that pointed us to a refueling station nearby.     
 Now we got a routine down on how to get what we need and avoid these assholes.     
 You didn't avoid us.     
 You're not them.     
 They're armed to the hilt in all-black uniforms.
