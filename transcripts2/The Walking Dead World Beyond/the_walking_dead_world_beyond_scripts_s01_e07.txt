 Either you joined me back here for my conversational skills or you really don't like that kid. 
 I don't. I don't know why anybody else does. 
 You conned us. 
 Tony: We saved all your asses! 
 My nephew promised you a ride, and I intend to make good on that. 
 But first I want to know about that fetching insignia you got there. 
 If we get into a bind, can that get us out? 
 Then tomorrow, we pick up your friend... 
 I'll spend the next day or two scouting ahead. 
 I'll be back... and we ride.
