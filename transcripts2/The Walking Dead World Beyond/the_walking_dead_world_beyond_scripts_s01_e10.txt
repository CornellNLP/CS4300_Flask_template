 Sometimes it's easier. 
 Hope wasn't acting like herself yesterday. 
 She was so pissed off trying to pick a fight. 
 Any idea why? 
 I told her something she didn't want to hear. 
 Yeah? 
 I told her I thought something was off with Huck. 
 That I didn't trust her. 
 [Chuckles] 
 And why would you say something like that, hmm? 
 Because it's true. 
I don't. 
 Huck has her own gun, plenty of bullets. 
 Why take yours? 
 Something is off with her. 
 Look... just because Silas isn't who we thought he was doesn't mean Huck isn't Huck. 
 I know this isn't what you want to hear, but...

 Huck didn't want us to. 
 This doesn't make any sense. 
 Then why would she leave with Hope? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, my God. 
 But when we catch up to them, you can ask her yourself. 
 She just shot him. 
 I just ran, thinking I was next. 
 Thinking I couldn't yell for help 'cause maybe you were all in on it.

 They weren't from him.

 They were from me. 
 What? 
 ♪♪ 
 I thought it was the easiest way to get you to leave the University. 
 The CR found out about the messages and intercepted the rest. 
 So we took advantage of that. 
 I wanted you to want to go. 
 To see if you would. 
 I thought you were strong enough. 
 I was right. 
 Figured your sister'd try and talk you out of it, so you'd come to me. 
 And the two of us would go. 
 Just the two of us. 
 Why? 
 [Sniffles, sighs] 
 You were convinced the world was gonna end. 
 So I taught you how to fight. 
 I needed you to see what was worth fighting for. 
 So, what's worth fighting for?

 Civilization. 
 A future. 
 The same future the Civic Republic is fighting for.

They take their sh1t seriously. 
 They have to. 
 The world's future is at stake. 
 Having other people trying to find out where they are, getting in the way of you seeing what we have to do to save it? 
 That wasn't gonna work. 
 That's why the others were expendable.

 One of the few left from before. 
 Mmm. 
 I think Hope might want to be a vintner. 
 With that mind? 
 Maybe. 
 I found a few books on winemaking in her room before I left, which... come to think of it, could just be her wanting to drink booze. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Soft piano music playing]

 She was all of 6 years old. 
 And I walk into the study to find processor chips and circuitry everywhere.

 What do they want from me? 
And where are we going? 
 Hope, you cracked a CRM cypher.

 It takes a special kind of smarts to pull that off. 
 You're idiots. 
I am not worth all this. 
 It's not just about you. 
 It's about people like you. 
 Making sure their gifts aren't being wasted. 
 It's gonna take a lot to bring this world back. 
 People like you need to be a big part of that. 
 I radioed the CR this morning after we left. 
 A chopper's meeting us 15 miles up to take you to your dad. 
 I-If things didn't go the way they did, if we had just made it there... 
 It would have been easier. 
 You would've been happy your dad's okay.

The future. 
 In 24 hours, you're going to be reunited with Hope. 
 She's on her way here. 
 Don't say anything. 
 Just take a moment to process it, okay? 
 All those months ago, when you told me about her gifts, about her genius, when you haven't even told her, you trusted me. 
 But I told them. 
 I had to. 
 We need generations of great minds. 
 You were frustrated with her. 
 She was frustrated with herself. 
 But she is safe, and she's seen the world now. 
 And because of that, she is ready. 
 To... bring back the world, it's going to take the brightest minds working together.

 Well, I've got something on mine. 
 [Glass thuds] 
 Something that's been eating at me, something sensitive. 
 What is it? 
 You can tell me anything. 
 This place is important to you. 
 It is to me, too. 
 The civilian government is doing great things. 
 You should know that's not what I'm questioning here. 
 But I do have my suspicions about your military.

 Well, things happen. 
 I-I-I mean, I'm sure they're f-fine, but... 
 Dr. Abbott? 
 How can you be certain he went to visit a sister? 
 I just...

 I have an idea, though. 
 How we can know for certain. 
 But I'll need your help.

 Huck: We're here. 
 You can put that away now. 
 [Sighs] 
 Gotta admit. 
 Considering how this all went down, I was afraid you'd fight this harder. 
 It's not about the now. 
 It's about the future. 
 Greater good. 
 Thinking about the big picture.

 It's good to see you again, 
Hope. 
 You've had quite the adventure. 
 Would you please relieve Miss Bennett of her belongings? 
 Well-done. 
 Seems we need a bit more work with her, but she's not fighting it. 
 She won't. 
 She knows what's at stake. 
 And I assume you were gonna tell me about the loose ends? 
 That truck, the others still out there. 
 We heard the transmission. 
 Makes me wonder what they know. 
 The ones that are still out there... 
 They're not a threat. 
 I'm taking care of them. 
We've found one. 
 We'll get the rest. 
 You should've let me handle this. 
 I was gonna make sure they get back to the Campus Colony. 
 I didn't want to have to step in, but that incident back home before you left for Omaha put your judgment in question. 
 At least in the eyes of others. 
 I had to see to it that your bringing us the asset was an unmitigated success, no loose ends, so I did. 
 I am. 
 And as far as the Campus Colony... we'll talk. 
 A lot's happened since you left.

 Because I'm not the real asset. 
 We are. 
 The two of us together. 
 We have spent our whole lives making each other better. 
 Stronger. 
 Your smarts. 
 Your instincts. 
 What if we can't trust her? 
 Hope: Your bravery. 
 Your fight. 
 They have no clue what you can do. 
 That's how we're gonna beat them. 
 They think they need me to save the world, but you... 
 You are gonna save the world from them. 
 We will. 
 We got this. 
 So grin, girl.
