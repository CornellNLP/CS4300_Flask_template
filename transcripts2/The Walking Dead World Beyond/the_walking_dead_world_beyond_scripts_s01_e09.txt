 If we could just crack this, it could tell us more about the CRM, help our chances of saving Dad. 
 Silas isn't a murderer.

 Elton: I'm leaving to join Silas. 
 I lied to you, Elton. 
 I didn't know it until I saw the picture in the book. 
 Clean up, we'll debrief. 
And take this. 
 Is this Dad's?
