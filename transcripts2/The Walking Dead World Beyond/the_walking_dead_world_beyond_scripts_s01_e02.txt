 Well... us being at the conclusion of the Holocene extinction, the sixth extinction event on the planet.     
 We were already killing ourselves directly and indirectly, but nature made a shortcut.     
 You know, it took the dinosaurs possibly   ,    years to die after     million of living, so...

 IRIS: The B.O.G.     
 People have been talking about it since everything fell apart.     
 It's this everlasting fire of totally Old Testament proportions.     
 The predominant theory is that it's tires.     
 A  lot  of tires.     
 Left unattended, they can burn for years, even decades.     
 It's just a fire, though.     
 No, no, it's much more than that.     
 The smoke plume and the firelight after dark have been attracting empties to it for years and years, like moths to a flame.     
 And the more that come, the louder it gets, which attracts more.     
 Thus explaining why we haven't seen too many around here.     
 So, can we get through it?
