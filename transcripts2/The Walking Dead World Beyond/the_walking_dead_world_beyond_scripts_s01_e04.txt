 Previously on "The Walking Dead: World Beyond"...   
 HOPE: The pregnant lady we saw that night that Mom died,   
 I scared her, and she shot Mom.   
 I knew there was something you didn't tell me.   
 SILAS: I don't wanna be who everybody thinks I am here.   
 In case we have to kill any, do you think you can do it?   
 HOPE: I told him not to go.   
 I screamed at him not to go.    
 If you want to keep your promise to our dad,    
 - then you'll help us find him. 
- Great.    
 ELTON: So, we know based on the code and map we were given that the Civic Republic's research facility is somewhere in New York state.    
 IRIS: But we don't know where exactly. Not yet.    
 As is all the more reason to turn around.    
 Just saying.    
 Nice try.    
 We might have taken a wrong turn back there,but this should still lead to the interstate.    
 Yeah, well, bad news. 
We're almost out of supplies, and it looks like rain's coming, so...    
 HUCK: If the way station Will mentioned had panned out, that'd be one thing, but...    
 It's cool.    
 We'll figure it out.    
 How come he's smiling?    
 [CHUCKLES]    
 Hey, how come you're smiling?    
 ELTON: Where do you think the Civic Republic is?    
 It's called "The Hidden City" for a reason.    
 When people first started talking about an alliance with this "hidden city,"    
 I pictured it underground.    
 - Me too. 
- Hmm.    
 I mean, but they refine their own fuel.    
 They fly helicopters. 
They grow their own crops.    
 - Hmm. 
- Can't do that underground.    
 Well, their research place, where our dad is, that's not actually where they are.    
 Maybe they do all that other stuff somewhere else, too.    
 Regardless, their high resource output would indicate they have a large population.    
 So if that were the case, their security approach... you know, not saying where they are... would be understandable.    
 That sounds like some shady sh1t to me.    
 - Hmm. 
- It does.    
 And those messages from your father are certainly cause for concern, but if they have technology and agriculture and sophisticated governmental systems, it'd be smart to stay hidden, even if it makes others question their motives.    
 I guess what I'm saying is we should feel lucky that they haven't taken over, you know,    
 - taken things. 
- We don't know they haven't.    
 Yeah, we know that because we trade with them.    
 Portland does, too.    
 We have joint protection agreements.    
 Well, they took our dad, so...    
 Bottom line is we don't know anything.    
 Ergo the long walk, Champ.    
 Look, we got just enough food and water to get us to Omaha.    
 That's it.    
 Except Omaha's north, and they're headed east.    
 Yeah.    
 From the looks of it, they're not changing their minds.    
 - At least not Iris. 
- Yeah.    
 Silas, neither.    
 [SIGHS]    
 Any idea why Corduroy decided to play tag-along?    
 I didn't really think he knew the girls that well.    
 The kid may be the wedge.    
 Hey, why don't you talk to him, convince him to change his mind?    
 - I'll handle Hope.

 FELIX: This place is huge.     
 No sign of empties, but that does not mean that they're not around.     
 Priorities are food, clothes for Hope, and anything we can use to collect water.     
 Might as well take advantage of the downpour outside.

 I'm so embarrassed for you right now.     
 I would laugh if I wasn't so hungry.     
 [THUNDER RUMBLING]     
 So, uh, what happened?     
 Last we talked, you thought the world was ending and people were sh1t.     
 Now you're walking through a thousand miles of empties on a hunch.     
 You think it's too late to reinvent myself?     
 Check it out. The options are endless.     
 You led me and Felix right to you.     
 You get roped into this, or did you have second thoughts?     
 I did.     
 But then I got second thoughts on my second thoughts.     
 You gonna be straight with me or what?     
 Yeah.     
 Once you're straight with me about where Cool Huck went.     
 'Cause right now you're starting to sound a lot like my dad.     
 You never showed up.     
 Principal Kallenbach's office?     
 Ring any bells?     
 I sat there and waited for you all day, and you never showed.     
 Right.     
 That.     
 So, you forgot?     
 Well, I was gonna go between classes, but then I came up with the exact right phrase for the start of the Advanced Immunology Textbook preface, the one giving me all the trouble, remember?     
 That's when I forgot.     
 And by that point, I had another class.     
 And... And then I decided that if you sat there all day, maybe you'd think twice before setting off stink bombs to try to get a day off of school.     
 Then I wondered if all that transpired was just a product of the background processes of my brain, which made me forget again until right now.     
 So... you want to tell me what's going on with you?     
 This is getting to be a regular thing.     
 They weren't just stink bombs.     
 They were time-release stink bombs.     
 They took two weeks to perfect.     
 Never mind.     
 Picking a dud like me, you probably kick yourself some days.

 Least you did good with Iris.     
 ♪     
 The agency told me and your mother you shared a crib.     
 You two were inseparable.     
 You were bonded before we ever met you.     
 From the moment we laid eyes on you both, we just wanted to protect you.     
 We knew that even if we couldn't, you'd protect each other.     
 You did good with Iris.     
 And she did good with you.     
 I've never wished for another Iris.     
 I love you unconditionally.     
 I just hate that you don't see yourself the way I do because you are exceptional.     
 I got to go help Iris before she burns dinner again.

 You think it's defending its young?     
 If I'm right, I think I know how we can get around it.

- Mm.     
 Is there another way out?     
 Uh, there's a back way. Leads to the basement.     
 But there's an empty there.     
 Alright, we'll go down, and we'll come back up.     
 I'll take care of the empty.     
 I need you two to stay here until then, alright?     
 There's something else roaming these hallways, and I don't think it's friendly.

 So, that whole defending its young thing?     
 Something I picked up being out there as long as I was.     
 See, it's easy to think you're reading a situation the right way.     
 Sometimes, though, there's a whole other thing going on you had no idea about.     
 Like, how you're trying to get me to turn back?     
 That's what that was, right?     
 I mean, all those questions?     
 You should.     
 A few days ago, I would've, alright, but now I know I can't.     
 Dads have a weird way of showing they give a sh1t.     
 And maybe I had my dad's sh1t all wrong.     
 What do you mean?     
 Before my dad left, he told me that it wasn't my fault that I was so frustrated.     
 I thought he was just saying sh1t to try and make me feel better, but maybe...     
 Maybe he was trying to protect me, like that wolf.     
 Protect you from what?     
 I don't know.     
 Something.     
 When I find him, I'll ask him.
