 Previously on Underground This rescue gonna be the toughest thing you ever done. 
  (shouts) 
  - Where's Noah?! 
  - They took him. 
  PEARLY MAE: You sad, pretty little thing. 
  This your life now? 
  Just kill yourself. 
  Welcome to the sewing circle. 
  We aim to incite good people to action. 
  There is an open seat on the Court of Commons. 
  We put my name on the ballot, and then I can start making rulings that'll help the cause. 
  John Hawkes! 
  (Bette humming) 
  (humming continues) 
  - (door opens) 
  - (babbling) 
  What you doin' back here so early? 
  I want to show you somethin'. 
  (babbling) 
  No matter how sweet Did you just I been teachin' myself to read. 
  And writin', it's just drawin' the sounds that the words make. 
  What it say? 
  It say how I feel about you. 
  It say why I taught myself to do this. 
  It say "love. 
  " Could ever help Relieve this pain It's amazing. 
  I want to keep it forever. 
  But this could get us killed. 
  (ears ringing) 
  Where is everybody?! 
  (ringing continues) 
  Somebody help! 
  (ringing continues) 
  (sniffling) 
  The wagon's ready. 
  You gonna need a teaspoon of this twice a day. 
  Keep that infection off. 
  His bandage fresh, but he gonna need a change once you gets to Ripley. 
  It's right there. 
  I put some jewelweed in here, too. 
  I know a doctor there who's a friend of the cause. 
  - Valentine will be in good hands. 
  - We gonna have to get movin'. 
  Whoever done this to John might know this house is a station. 
  If they're brazen enough to target John in broad daylight, - they'd have already stormed the house. 
  - We got to notify - them other stations. 
  - Wires went out this morning. 
  There's a hold on all cargo for the next two days. 
  Well, then that mean Moses gonna be stuck in Ripley. 
  Ain't no way she gonna make the train by the week's end. 
  Moses will find a way. 
  Rosalee, right now you got to focus on your family. 
  Elizabeth is going to need you. 
  HARRIET: It's not a plan yet, not by a long shot, but it's got the makings of one. 
  The furrier's boat leavin' in three days' time, but it's a four-day journey. 
  We gonna have to push. 
  We told Grant and the other stations we would lay low. 
  Well, if there's any trouble to be had, I'd rather face it on the road. 
  ROSALEE: So we take the Cuyahoga up and catch the train. 
  What's the route to the river? 
  You ain't traveled it. 
  That stretch of woods is tough. 
  Only use it when we ain't got another choice. 
  - GEORGIA: Perhaps we to - Excuse me, ma'am. 
  Is lunch ready? 
  No, it is not. 
  (footsteps departing) 
  (door closes, lock clicks) 
  Tell us about the furrier. 
  HARRIET: Met him through a bondsman who was workin' for him. 
  Barely makin' ends meet. 
  Already smugglin'. 
  Mean he don't care for authority. 
  It's gonna take all of that. 
  It's a dry route. 
  I'll send word to a woman I know that'll be able to help with Harriet? 
  I got her! 
  I've heard rumors about her spells. 
  I just thought it was part of her mystique. 
  I suppose it is, but it ain't rumors. 
  I heard that's also where she gets her visions from. 
  She'll come around soon. 
  (sighs) 
  I meant to thank you earlier. 
  For helpin' with Noah's escape. 
  Of course. 
  The sewing circle is always there for a member in need. 
  (sighs) 
  How's Elizabeth doing? 
  Best she can, considerin'. 
  And when is the funeral going to be? 
  I'll send Elizabeth a wire. 
  I'll let her know that you got off safely. 
  Can you tell her I'm sorry? 
  The plan has changed. 
  (exhales) 
  (sighs) 
  HARRIET: You didn't get your man. 
  And it got you doubtin' everything. 
  He was supposed to be here. 
  John was supposed to be here. 
  But ain't nothin' the way it's supposed to be. 
  And now you is leavin' me, too. 
  You got time to figure things out. 
  No, I don't. 
  Christmas comin' soon. 
  It's my only shot of stealin' my mother and brother. 
  Look at me. 
  I ain't ready. 
  You will be. 
  Everything you learn moving this cargo gonna help you rescue your kin. 
  And ain't nothing more for you to do about Noah. 
  (sighs) 
  Focus on what you got to do now. 
  Tell me the plan. 
  We go north along the river. 
  Find the notches in the trees. 
  Then what? 
  Then we travel by day, stickin' to the back roads, till we make a break for the water. 
  And if we make it in good time, it's a straight shot to the river. 
  And if you come across any danger, you remember what I told you about the instinct. 
  What if I ain't able to do it alone? 
  You know what I saw when I had my spell? 
  You. 
  (sighs) 
  On the riverbank. 
  Boat in the distance. 
  You had this look on your face. 
  It was one of accomplishment. 
  And you know who ain't there with you? 
  Now, these turkey feathers will protect you from the buckshot. 
  And you trust Him to protect you from the rest. 
  (exhales) 
  POE: Seem to me they keep movin' the line. 
  First it's the River Jordan. 
  Now it's Canada. 
  Who know what it be once we get up there? 
  They always say "the promise of freedom. 
  " Maybe that's all it is, a promise that ain't gonna never be kept. 
  MICAH: Remember what Moses said about St. 
  Catherine? 
  About it being God's country. 
  You ever been, Ms. 
  Rose? 
  - Only a few times. 
  - And? 
  What it like? 
  - (Micah coughing) 
  - Still work yet to be done, but seem like a place you could stop lookin' over your shoulder. 
  And families ain't like they are down in the South. 
  They seem whole. 
  And your children, you raise 'em without having to worry about ever having to run. 
  Miss Rose? 
  Somethin' wrong? 
  It's Rosalee! 
  We lost, ain't we? 
  Nah. 
  ELIJAH: It do seem like we goin' in circles. 
  We ain't lost! 
  Then why's you cryin'? 
  (Micah coughing) 
  (sniffles) 
  I seen a markin' half a mile down. 
  POE: She gonna get us caught out here. 
  - Don't know where she goin'. 
  - (coughing): She she brought us out here, didn't she? 
  POE: She ain't done nothin' but listen to Moses like the rest of us. 
  We ain't gonna make it out here. 
  Listen to that cough of yours. 
  HARRIET: Find the notches on the trees. 
  We-we here! 
  We's here. 
  We here. 
  (panting) 
  (horse neighs) 
  We-we rest the night, travel by day. 
  (birds chirping) 
  (exhales) 
  (door creaks) 
  A friend of a friend sent me. 
  Reverend Josiah Henson, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Arthur Tappan. 
  Moses usually the one that comes. 
  Plan done changed, but the cargo still the same. 
  They need to drink, and you need to eat. 
  Well's around back. 
  I'll bring the cargo through. 
  HARRIET: Listen to your instincts. 
  Easy, now. 
  We gonna want her to bring that cargo back to us. 
  PATTY: Something's off. 
  (clock ticking) 
  You should keep that. 
  John would want you to have it. 
  ROSALEE: He needs to take Valentine now. 
  (sighs) 
  I keep (sniffles) 
  thinking about children. 
  Come on, now. 
  You-you need your rest. 
  For so long, not being able to have any was like like an open wound. 
  A pain in my entire body. 
  This work we do I thought it helped close it. 
  But now I can't help but think that if we'd had a child, I would have something left of him. 
  It was foolish of me to think that there's such a thing as closing wounds. 
  They bleed and bleed. 
  And this one I mean, my my dress it's so it's so clean. 
  I didn't even I didn't even touch him after. 
  And now he he's gone. 
  (sobbing) 
  (sniffling) 
  GEORGIA: It lets out at the river's edge, and you can make a quick escape to the tunnel from any floor of the house. 
  The stairs go to the second and third. 
  The ladder all the way to the attic. 
  This station can house up to eight comfortably, more if the need arises. 
  Valentine is the only occupant at the moment. 
  The chill down here in the winter is insufferable, which is why we thought it best to use the attic as the primary hiding spot. 
  Primary? 
  There's more? 
  Oh, hiding places, compartments for guns, as you know, and a few hidden passageways. 
  It's an ingenious design of which I can take no credit. 
  Carpentry was a hobby of my late husband's. 
  If the cargo is staying for more than a night or two, I try to familiarize them with everything so that they feel comfortable moving through the common spaces. 
  After all, they didn't brave the dangers of the journey north to be imprisoned in an attic. 
  You're not worried about your boarders seeing them and giving you up to the authorities? 
  Most are friends of the cause, like you. 
  I'd like to show you the rest of the rooms in the house, but there's no rush. 
  If you'll be staying for a while? 
  There's so much to do for John's funeral, but I just had to get out of that house. 
  Richard had been sick for a long time before he passed. 
  I thought I was prepared. 
  I cannot imagine what you're going through, having lost John so suddenly. 
  I don't think it matters the time. 
  The quiet after they're gone is still deafening. 
  Staying busy and being around a lot of people helps. 
  Rosalee left last night. 
  She was torn about going, but Harriet needed her. 
  She said as much in the wire. 
  She's not going to make the funeral. 
  She's the only family that John has left. 
  I know that she wanted to be there. 
  I think it was just too much. 
  Everybody grieves in their own way. 
  (footsteps approaching) 
  I used to lay awake at night thinkin' on the number 39. 
  That was the number of lashes the overseer was allowed by Massa Slattery to give us. 
  Not 40, not 35, but 39. 
  Why 39? 
  I used to lay awake and thinkin' on all the sufferin' massa gave out. 
  Then I start thinkin' on all the other plantations, what they going through, what they sufferin', how many lashes they got. 
  Countless sleepless nights. 
  Got so bad, I start started tradin' anything I could to get my hands on some laudanum, just so I could get a little piece of sleep. 
  But you know what I realized? 
  Ain't no sense to this world. 
  There be the bad, but there be the good, too. 
  And look at me. 
  I'm almost to freedom wearin' a good man's suit. 
  You just got to have a little faith that things'll be all right. 
  You get you some sleep. 
  (ears ringing) 
  (ears continue ringing) 
  (voice fading in): They were serene, elegant, and nothing like my scatterbrained husband. 
  Gerber daisies that's what they should have been. 
  I put them on his grave from time to time. 
  The florist came by looking for you. 
  Even left a few flowers for you to see. 
  He'll need a decision on the arrangements for John's service by 5:00 if they are to be ready for tomorrow. 
  That gives us a little over an hour. 
  Plenty of time. 
  And then there is the matter of choosing the plot and the Psalm to be read. 
  And John's suit will need to be pressed, as well. 
  I'd be happy to do it. 
  I know it's a lot. 
  But I promise we can conquer it all together. 
  If we leave now. 
  I have sat on this bench waiting for John to get out of court a thousand times. 
  When he had a case, he would throw himself into it so completely that he practically lived here. 
  It's what I loved about him. 
  He really believed he could make a difference. 
  He devoted his life to this place, and not one goddamn person cares about getting justice for his murder. 
  A good man, the best man, was shot in broad daylight, and everybody's calling it a senseless act. 
  That's just that's just an excuse. 
  So nobody has to take responsibility for allowing this world to be senseless. 
  So what? 
  You take my gun from your purse and you make someone take responsibility? 
  A judge? 
  A deputy? 
  You said it. 
  We have to disrupt their happy little lives. 
  That is not what I meant. 
  This is not justice. 
  It won't make anything good and fair. 
  John would have stopped You wouldn't be doing it for John, you'd be doing it for yourself. 
  Leave me alone. 
  Please. 
  I am not going anywhere. 
  No matter how Sweet the salt We push So hard we finally broke Treasured moments become lost treasures when you Can't recollect Everyone keeps asking are we okay The truth is we're not But I don't know what to say Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh-oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
  (birds chirping) 
  (bottles clinking gently) 
  TABLE-TAPPER: This here sacred tree been here since before we was stole from across the sea. 
  Been here long before the great house was built. 
  And gonna be here long after the field dry up. 
  And just like this here tree, nourished by the blood of we ancestors, we too will thrive. 
  (humming) 
  HICKS: What that you singin'? 
  I don't know. 
  (chuckles) 
  (resumes humming) 
  Them spirits got ahold of that pretty voice of yours, huh? 
  - Let's see. 
  - (banjo tuning) 
  TABLE-TAPPER: There's a poison making it way through we people. 
  (women grunting in agreement) 
  Making we spirit weak. 
  Some amongst we, the evil done take over. 
  WOMAN: Yeah, yeah, Lord. 
  They done forgot what we ancestors taught we. 
  (crowd murmurs in agreement) 
  We hang the bottles for trap the evil spirit that threaten us. 
  Daughter, please. 
  To keep we people strong. 
  This here who we be. 
  (crowd murmurs, light applause) 
  (inhales deeply) 
  This sacred tree can protect we if we protect one another. 
  WOMAN: Yes, sir. 
  TABLE-TAPPER: It be the ancestor way, it be we way, it gon' be the children way. 
  (crowd murmurs in agreement, applause) 
  I ain't mean to hurt you. 
  You know that, right? 
  Them pretty eyes that low honey voice. 
  I would do anything for you. 
  And I know you feel the same. 
  There's a girl that's gonna need your help. 
  You gonna help her for me? 
  (grunts softly) 
  (man humming) 
  (humming continues) 
  HICKS: Storm coming. 
  About two days out. 
  I'm gonna walk on over to the east plantation, get some trading done before the flood cut 'em off. 
  (humming continues) 
  (birds chirping) 
  Hicks say you's could help me. 
  Drink all of it. 
  It hurt? 
  You'll have some pain, pass the baby sometime later. 
  It's gonna be bloody. 
  Ain't like I never bled before. 
  You gonna stand there, you got to work. 
  You know who the father is? 
  I only laid with your man one time. 
  He don't want it. 
  And even if he did, he ain't the fathering type no way. 
  What everybody gonna say when they find out? 
  They gonna shame meself. 
  Shame me father. 
  Some of 'em good people, but some of 'em they just, they wait for something to bring the table-tapper low with. 
  Everybody gonna help raise him. 
  That's how they be. 
  Talk bad about you, then help. 
  And ain't no man gonna want me. 
  Not for marry, nohow. 
  I have this baby, maybe this baby all me gonna have. 
  You got chillun? 
  Yes. 
  And? 
  And they were the best thing in my life. 
  GULLAH: Me can't remember the last time we big house been open like this yonder. 
  Mimba say they sending them girls from the great house to get 'em ready. 
  For who? 
  Not Massa Rowe. 
  - How you know? 
  - Shh! 
  How you know ain't massa? 
  Honey, ever lay a eye on Massa Rowe round these parts? 
  Hell, ever lay eyes on Massa Rowe at all? 
  Could've been that white man just passed us now, eh? 
  (inhales) 
  (sniffles) 
  FRENCH: I used to love the taste of them berries on your lips, back when you was carrying Sam. 
  (chuckles softly) 
  Funny how a memory can take hold of the senses. 
  The smell, the taste. 
  Make 'em mean something. 
  What them berries taste like to you? 
  Happiness. 
  (chuckles) 
  We was happy then. 
  Sam warm in your belly, life full of possibilities. 
  Mm. 
  Then he was born, and all that changed. 
  The fear creeped in stole everything. 
  That's not true. 
  We was happy until Until I died. 
  That was when your eyes fell on the big house. 
  Wasn't gonna love no more unless you got something from it, other than heartbreak. 
  That ain't true. 
  I couldn't let what happened to you happen to Sam. 
  You let your heart go cold. 
  He felt it. 
  Rosalee, too. 
  That's why she ran. 
  No. 
  My chillun knew how much I loved them. 
  That's right. 
  You loved them so much that you opened your legs whenever the massa called to protect 'em. 
  Killed for 'em. 
  You loved your chillun so much that, after James, you made sure that you couldn't have no more. 
  Your chillun is the worst thing that ever happened to you. 
  And here you are, picking raspberry leaves for that that girl and her baby. 
  (thunder rumbling) 
  (rain falling) 
  CLARA: No, no, please. 
  - HICKS: Come here! 
  - Please, please! 
  - Shut up! 
  - Please, don't do this! 
  Please, don't do this! 
  - Shut your goddamn mouth! 
  - No! 
  No! 
  I want the baby. 
  - Please! 
  - Shh! 
  I ain't never gonna tell nobody. 
  Shut your mouth, woman, 'fore somebody hear you! 
  Shut up! 
  Where it at? 
  (whimpering) 
  Where it at?! 
  (muffled screaming) 
  (Clara coughing) 
  HICKS: Swallow it. 
  Swallow it. 
  Swallow it! 
  (Clara groaning, gasping) 
  (sobbing) 
  No matter how sweet the salt (sobbing) 
  We pushed so hard We finally broke (banjo tuning) 
  Oh, no more apologies Need be exchanged Oh, no words could ever help Relieve this pain (Hicks humming) 
  (bottles clinking gently) 
  (humming continues) 
  French? 
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (wagon rumbling) 
  (men speaking foreign language) 
  (grunting) 
  I can't see. 
  (shouts in foreign language) 
  Piss and shite! 
  (speaking foreign language) 
  (men speaking foreign language) 
  (speaking foreign language) 
  (wagon rumbling) 
  (pained grunt) 
 
 
 
  (pained grunting) 
  (strains) 
  (metal snaps) 
  (grunts) 
  (grunts) 
  (metal creaks) 
  (bolt snaps) 
  (panting) 
  (chassis creaking) 
  (wood crackling) 
  (horse neighs) 
  - (man shouts) 
  - Hear the sound of the bells when the law gone And the boys will leash hell when the war's on Bloodthirsty when the dogs put the gloves on You gon' tell the medic "put a little bit of gauze on" Put 'em on the battlefield where they click And ignorant niggas are tryin' to miss what I say, uh Your man's a bitch, you put a purse on him Get them wild niggas throwin' red deaths on him Put a little dirt on 'em. 
  (horse neighs) 
  Hey, guys. 
  Sorry, the wagon was a little cramped, so I just thought I'd stretch my legs. 
  (laughs) 
  (grunting) 
  FRANCIS: Enough. 
  NOAH: You're doin' it wrong. 
  (tool cranks) 
  I could've fixed it a couple hours ago. 
  Been back on the road to wherever y'all takin' me by now, but that's all right. 
  Got myself a nice bit of sleep in. 
  Just lovely. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  (Noah laughs) 
  You still doin' it wrong. 
  Y'all think y'all too good to talk to me? 
  You ain't. 
  You out here, handlin' the cattle with your rundown wagon. 
  Trudging through the mud and the heat. 
  Seem to me that make you the slave. 
  And that man in the fancy carriage oh, he the massa. 
  Oh, so you can speak English. 
  Clever. 
  You've been watching us. 
  Enough to know if anyone was gonna slip up, it'd be this arse. 
  But you're not the only one who knows how to read a man. 
  You're keeping something from us. 
  At least, you think you are. 
  What's this? 
  (chuckles) 
  Oh, this means something to you, doesn't it? 
  Looks a little wee bit small for you. 
  But I got a real sweet lass back in Edinburgh who'll love it. 
  (grunts) 
  It's no lass I know want something that ugly. 
  (Roderick chuckles) 
  Five months you spent in that jail, making this, instead of trying to escape. 
  You know what that tells me? 
  You're an idiot. 
  What it should tell you is that I'm a patient man. 
  The type that'd spend three days and three nights destroying the wagon you can't seem to fix. 
  It should tell you that I care enough about somebody that I'm gonna get back to 'em. 
  No matter what. 
  (chuckles) 
  But you didn't go anywhere. 
  You're right back here in chains. 
  I won't always be. 
  And when I ain't first thing I'm-a do is get that ring. 
  (Roderick laughs) 
  Put a little dirt on 'em Everybody back up. 
  Back up. 
  You. 
  You remember what I told you? 
  First thing. 
  FRANCIS: Give him the ring. 
  Do it. 
  NOAH: Anyone moves, anyone tries to follow me out, your massa gets it. 
  (Cato laughing) 
  Problem is he's not the massa. 
  I am. 
  (grunts) 
  PATTY: Yes! 
  Oh! 
  Lift my left leg. 
  Lift up the left leg. 
  - (moans) 
  Yeah, oh, a little higher. 
  - (bed creaking) 
  Little higher. 
  Don't stop! 
  Don't stop! 
  Yes! 
  Oh! 
  - (gasps) 
  - Oh mmm. 
  (knock at door) 
  Get out. 
  Go. 
  Mr. 
  Donahue. 
  Oh, Miss Cannon. 
  - Please, come in. 
  - Thank you. 
  Call me Elden. 
  I was just now reading your latest, The Fuller. 
  - Oh. 
  - It's good. 
  Without trying too hard. 
  I appreciate the compliment. 
  That's exactly how I want my legacy to be recorded. 
  Please. 
  Thank you. 
  (clears throat) 
  I have to admit, Miss Cannon, your story is compelling. 
  From the start the daughter of an English nobleman and the American whore he laid with. 
  (chuckles softly) 
  Love is the great equalizer, isn't it? 
  And slave catching. 
  I'm taken in by it. 
  In a country that celebrates both its freedom and its commerce, it's in the context of your occupation where the two meet to do battle. 
  I have never thought of it that way. 
  I've done my research. 
  And you are one of the most notorious slave catchers out there. 
  Well, I am excited for people to hear my story. 
  Perhaps. 
  If I may, there is one question I've been dying to ask you. 
  (chuckles softly) 
  That's why we're here. 
  To be the most notorious slave catcher one would think you'd have caught the most notorious runaway. 
  Harriet Tubman. 
  That's right. 
  (scoffs) 
  That's not a question. 
  Fair enough. 
  I suppose my question is well why shouldn't I be writing the book about her? 
  (thunder rumbling) 
  PATTY: This is how my system works. 
  My guys come in and they bring me the money from the successful capture of a runaway. 
  And then I assign them the next one. 
  In the event that we ever work together, Miss Cannon, you don't have to provide all the details. 
  I'll simply write down what I see, as I see it. 
  (thunder rumbling) 
  You're light again, Jack. 
  One of 'em slipped away. 
  Let me guess: Pete? 
  Five-foot-two, 110 pounds? 
  I don't appreciate your taking stabs at my manhood, Patty. 
  Nigger Pete seems to be stabbing your manhood good enough for everyone. 
  Here's the thing, Jack. 
  I'm handing you five dollars. 
  Five dollars, and I certainly ain't gonna waste any kind of good lead on you. 
  Figured as much. 
  Well, then why show your face, take this kind of embarrassment? 
  For five dollars? 
  Is it really worth it? 
  I showed up because I got word on where this Harriet Tubman you've been asking about may be. 
  I was playing draw with this fella, spends nights with a lonely piece. 
  Up by the Cuyahoga. 
  Says Tubman pass through. 
  Pays her for water. 
  Smoke get the horses. 
  And my long-range. 
  And you know what? 
  Get Jack a ten-dollar advance for the trip north he's gonna be taking with us. 
  Come on. 
  We're on the hunt, boys! 
  (men shouting) 
  So who was she? 
  I'm sure I don't know. 
  Please. 
  Look, I did what you asked. 
  PATTY: I'd hate for my lead on Harriet to go dead here. 
  And that girl seemed to know Harriet. 
  So I could ask her. 
  Or I can keep asking you. 
  All I know is they call her the Black Rose. 
  (Micah coughing) 
  POE: Shut your mouth! 
  - You're gonna bring 'em right to us. 
  - Shh! 
  You yellin' ain't helpin'. 
  (Micah coughing) 
  Chew on this. 
  You said it was gon' be a straight shot to the river. 
  It is. 
  Then we should've rode hard for it. 
  No sense in us leaving that wagon. 
  There be too much mud around. 
  We leave tracks, they know we goin' straight for the boat. 
  Who'd know? 
  You said you ain't seen nobody. 
  Somethin' ain't feel right. 
  They out there, don't know how many. 
  But we ain't takin' no chances. 
  ELIJAH: What we's gon' do if we miss that boat? 
  Ain't no missin' it. 
  We gonna wait till it's right on that shore. 
  And run when the time is right. 
  And when's that gonna be? 
  Put a little dirt on 'em. 
  Wait. 
  (Micah coughing) 
  What is it? 
  Shh. 
  What you hear? 
  (quietly): Move! 
  Through them trees! 
  Go, go, go. 
  - Get on, now. 
  - (coughs) 
  Come on. 
  We almost there. 
  - I can't. 
  - Yes, you can. 
  Yes, you can. 
  (grunts) 
  Now, listen to me. 
  You got two choices: you got life, you got death. 
  You got to trust your instincts right now. 
  That animal, that animal inside of you, that fear he bring, it be powerful. 
  It gonna make your eyes blink wider, make your heart beat faster. 
  You gots to use it right now. 
  This is the only thing that's gonna save your life. 
  (gasps) 
  - (coughs) 
  - Run! 
  HARRIET: Know what I saw when I had my spell? 
  You, on the riverbank, boat in the distance. 
  You had this look on your face. 
  It was one of accomplishment. 
  (gunshot) 
  Go retrieve my Black Rose. 
  (water burbling) 
  (gasps) 
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh Spent your life collecting so you can never forget. 
  (heart beating faintly)
