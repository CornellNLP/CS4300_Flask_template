 (quietly) Hey.    
 (chuckles)    
 Mr. McBride.    
 Hey.    
 I sincerely apologize for hitting you earlier.    
 (chuckles)    
 Who the hell are you?    
 Oh. I'm, uh...    
 I'm Anton Jones, the Enrichment Center Manager of Operations.    
 And I checked your head, and I didn't break the skin.    
 It just seems like a small bump.    
 Where am I?    
 You're in the Blackwood Almond Enrichment Center.    
 My mother's Diana Blackwood, and the Blackwood Almond Enrichment Center is her creation.    
 And my uncle is Wade, who you've met.    
 Yeah.    
 Let me ask you something there, Anton.    
 Mm-hmm.    
 Exactly how come you'd have hit me like that?    
 Um, we just, uh...    
 I-I didn't know who you were, and we've had a fair share of transients on the property.    
 Well, listen, I'm gonna need to get back to the hotel and get my car.    
 You know anything about how I'd do that?    
 Mm-hmm. Totally understand.    
 And we've arranged for a shuttle to pick you up right now.    
 Oh, and, uh, how could I forget?    
 I hung on to your personal belongings for safekeeping.    
 The owl's yours, right?    
 The Blackwood Almond Company is committed to happiness and harmony, one snack at a time.    
 But that doesn't even begin to crack what's going on on the inside. (chuckles)    
 My mother, Diana, is launching her very own almond-based lifestyle brand, starting off with a line of all-natural, chemical-free, happiness-inducing skincare and clean beauty products, expanding the Blackwood Almond Company brand.    
 - Go, Mom, right? 
- Yeah.    
 But, you know, Diana herself has battled anxiety and depression and swears by the mood-boosting wonders of Blackwood Almonds.    
 BILLY: Looks like the nut business is swinging.    
 Mm-hmm. We've done very well.    
 Must take a lot of water.    
 Oh, water's above my pay grade.    
 - (laughter) 
- BILLY: What do you do here at the wonderful world of almonds?    
 Mm, as I mentioned earlier, I run the Enrichment Center, which is solely focused on taking Blackwood Almonds, happiness from the ground up,    
 one snack at a time, and optimizing one's well-being, mind, body and spirit.    
 Well, I'm pretty sure you're anxious to get back home and see your daughter off to college.    
 I'm a Trojan man myself, but no judgment.    
 BILLY: Oh, yeah? How do you know where she goes to school?    
 ANTON: Eh, just be careful what you say to Rita.    
 Nothing she loves more than a little bit of keno, whiskey and some idle gossip.    
 I'll keep that in mind.    
 All right.    
 These... are for your daughter.     
 And if she's interested, she could become a brand ambassador on campus.     
 It's a paid position, promoting Blackwood Almond products at various venues.     
 It's not too time-consuming, and the application is online.     
 Excellent. Well, I'll make sure and tell her.     
 - Yeah. 
- Have a good day.     
 Yeah, you, too. Yeah, yeah.     
 - Thanks for the lift. 
- Anytime!     
 (quietly) Don't know why the f*ck you gave it to me if I got to put it back in here.     
 Hey, listen, uh, let me ask you a question.     
 Uh, you know any dirt roads around here with, like, a wooden gate?     
 There's all kinds of dirt roads. 
What are you looking for?     
 Well, last night, I was walking around.     
 I saw lights and heard some drilling going on.     
 - There's a lot of drilling around here. 
- Oh.     
 Everyone's trying to dig the deeper well.     
 Yeah, I hear you.     
 Back to the casino?     
 Yes, sir.

 There's a sensor attached to the bottom of the tape measure.     
 It'll beep when we hit water.     
 So, tell me something, can you tell how much water a specific farmer's well     
 - has dug out of the ground? 
- I might be able to come up with a rough estimate.     
 But it would just be a guess.     
 (beeping)     
 Ah. Here we go.     
 (exhales)     
 We're down eight feet since last month.     
 How bad is that?     
 Bad-bad.     
 Historic low.     
 I know what you need.     
 But I can't assign an exact number to a specific farmer's well.     
 I'm just trying to find out if somebody stole my client's water.     
 Mm. Water underneath the land doesn't belong to anyone.     
 If you can get a drill down to it, it's yours.     
 Guess my only other shot is... try to prove unreasonable use.     
 Let me put it to you this way: the corporate farmers in this area use more water than the entire city of L.A., which is f*cked up and entirely unreasonable, in my opinion.     
 Okay. I appreciate it.     
 Thanks.     
 (insects trilling)     
 Hey. I'm almost there. What's up?     
 BILLY: So, I talked to Dr. Mindy from the U.S.     
 Geological Survey, and I don't think we can pin the water problem on any of Gene's neighbors.     
 Okay, so we... so we don't have a wrongful death case.     
 Well, we could build a case around reasonable use.     
 You know, corporate farming at this scale during a drought is unreasonable.     
 That's... No. That's a trash box idea.     
 - No. 
- Yeah.     
 We'll know more once you get the information     
 - from the water board. 
- (sighs) All right.     
 So, uh, what do we need? We need drilling permits, board meeting minutes, uh, distribution docs. 
What else? What else?     
 And whatever you can get.     
 Also, thank you for sending me to such a lush, uh, and vibrant landscape.     
 I am literally surrounded by culture.     
 So, you're the f*cking best.     
 So, thank you.     
 f*ck am I?

 And it has nothing to do with Gene, or even Gene's case.     
 - I don't give a sh1t. 
- It's okay.     
 I've never liked this plan.     
 Your sister is drilling on federal f*cking land.     
 She's still got to move the water under my property.     
 With lawyers poking around...     
 He asks the right questions, this is gonna be a big f*cking problem.     
 The big f*cking problem is making you a shitload of money.     
 Yeah. Your sister's ambition's gonna be our downfall.     
 No, it's not. It's not gonna come to that.     
 You know, my property is all I have to leave Stephanie.     
 It's where her mother and I were the happiest.     
 - I know. I know. 
- So let's pump the brakes on this sh1t until this Gene thing blows over.

 (chuckles) It's the hostess's problem.     
 I'm so sorry about my son.     
 He's, uh... he's very enthusiastic.     
 - Mm, that's an understatement. 
- Oh...     
 Well, I'm, uh, I'm glad you were able to come and that there was no permanent damage.     
 Well, I've been hit in the head quite a number of times.     
 - (laughs) Oh, no. 
- So I think the damage     
 - has already been done. 
- I'm sure that's not true.     
 - Oh, it's true. 
- Hey, Roy.     
 I'd like to talk to you for a minute.     
 Oh.     
 - (chuckles) I'm in trouble now. 
- Oh, just excuse us.     
 It's just a business thing.     
 - Oh, yeah. 
- But, uh, please, enjoy yourself, and, uh, it was nice to officially meet you.     
 - Yeah, you, too. 
- Billy.     
 (whispering) Why are you talking to him?     
 - Huh? Oh, f*ck. 
- Why are you talking to him at a party?     
 - At a party in my house. 
- Don't get your panties in an uproar.     
 You are talking...     
 Did you have fun tonight?     
 Well, I wasn't really here for fun, but, uh, I was here.     
 Hi.     
 Hey.     
 - (sighs) 
- So, uh... where's your fella?     
 We drove separately.     
 Why's that?     
 A little spat?     
 - (sighs) 
- Well, I guess I have to ask.     
 Are you or aren't you?     
 What are you talking about?     
 Are you engaged?     
 That's the big breaking news, you know.     
 - Yeah. 
- (vehicle approaching)     
 It's good to see you, Billy.     
 Yeah, good to see you.

 - Top of the morning to you, Wade. 
- Hey. Well, it's the afternoon.     
 - You just get up? 
- Yeah, I kind of slept in     
 - a little bit. 
- Mm.     
 Well, have some breakfast, man.     
 Oh, God, no, I don't... I can't eat before, like,  :   in the...     
 Oh, come on, it's the most important meal of the day.     
 (chuckles) Yeah, for some people, not me.     
 (snorts)     
 So, uh...     
 You want to talk about water?     
 Absolutely. Yeah.     
 Um... so, your buddy, Wheeler, he, uh, he said something to me last night.     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Kind of struck me as odd.     
 Uh, he said I was wasting my time with the water board.     
 It's pretty standard stuff.     
 Well, where else should I be looking?     
 For Gene?     
 Mother Nature's to blame.     
 So that's it, then? Just the drought.     
 Mm-hmm.     
 (quietly) Huh.     
 It's not the drilling that's going on around here at night?     
 That's the way we beat the heat around here, that drilling.     
 I don't want my workers dropping dead from heatstroke.     
 No, no. I certainly understand that.     
 But, now, Wheeler, he's... he's on the water board, right?     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Wonder why he'd say something like that. Oh, hang on a sec.     
 (phone vibrating)     
 Oh, Wade, this is my daughter. I got to take it.     
 Family first.     
 Hey, honey.     
 Jesus, Dad, I thought you were dead.     
 What?     
 You left me a voice mail at  :   a.m.     
 Something about... writing on the walls and... how you thought you were gonna die and how you wanted me to know that you loved me.     
 Do you not remember calling me?     
 I-I don't know, honey.     
 - Maybe I was just tired. 
- All right, well,     
 I'm gonna send you the message 'cause it scared the sh1t out of me.     
 (sniffs) Are you okay?     
 Yeah, I-I'm fine.     
 I'm sorry I scared you, honey.     
 Please don't do it again.     
 Okay.     
 How about you? Is everything okay?     
 My roommate snores.     
 Look, I... I got to get to class, so just...     
 I'm glad you're not dead.     
 You just don't worry. Go on to class.     
 Check in with me later.     
 - WOMAN (laughs):   ! 
- What?     
 I...     
 I played your number,   , and I won!     
 Oh, good. Good.     
 That's great. I'm gonna get back in this meeting, but you have a fun day today, will you?     
 - Okay. 
- Okay.     
 (woman speaking over radio indistinctly)     
 (knocking)     
 Hey.     
 I'm so happy you came.     
 - (sighs) 
- (chuckles) Come in, come in.     
 I was just making a cup of tea.     
 Would you like some?     
 DELORES: Okay.     
 JT: Okay.     
 - I'm glad you're here. 
- I'll be in so much trouble if they know I took this out of the office.     
 Delores, I promise you, nobody's gonna find out.     
 You don't understand. (chuckles softly)     
 Someone, somewhere is always watching.     
 Then we're gonna have to be extra careful.     
 May I?     
 Thank you.     
 (takes deep breath)     
 I'm gonna take this one file out of the binder.     
 Are you okay with that?     
 You take nothing for granted.     
 I feel terrible about what happened to Bobbi Bennett.     
 - Yeah. 
- She was so nice.     
 Well... this is really gonna help her case.     
 - (loud bang) 
- (gasps) What was that?     
 - (teakettle whistling) 
- I don't know.     
 - Oh! Jesus! 
- Oh! (gasps)     
 (cawing)     
 Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!     
 Get!     
 - Get out! 
- (Delores whimpers)     
 Get out!     
 - (teakettle continues whistling) 
- It's okay. It's gone.     
 - No. No, it's a sign. 
- No, no, it's...     
 I knew this was bad. I shouldn't have done this.     
 No, no, you-you... you're overreacting.     
 (chuckles) It's a bird.     
 A bird that flew into the...     
 It's...     
 Delores, it's okay!     
 (teakettle continues whistling)     
 (whistling slowly stops)     
 (exhales)     
 JT: Billy, you remember     
 - the late '  s? 
- I sure do.     
 Patty, you may be too young for this.     
 I absolutely am, yep.     
 We had a six-year drought in California.     
 BILLY: Yeah, they told us to take a shower     
 - with a friend. Remember that? 
- Come on.     
 - And we did. 
- Why?     
 Because it was fun.     
 It was... fun.     
 Anyway, because of the drought, the Department of Water Resources decided to cut back... on the ranchers' water, giving preference to the residential use.     
 PATTY: That makes sense.     
 Yeah.     
 Only when it happened again, the ranchers threatened to sue the state.     
 Only instead of going to court, they arranged for a secret, closed-door meeting with the Department of Water Resources and L.A.'s Metropolitan Water District...     
 - in Big Sur. 
- BILLY: Big Sur.     
 Yes, sir.     
 Yes, sir. Big Sur.     
 Because of this secret Big Sur agreement, in exchange for cutting the ranchers' water during the drought, these sneaky sh1ts, these little douchebag ranchers managed to get the state to give them total control of the state's water bank.     
 What's a water bank?     
 BILLY: It's an underground reservoir.     
 The state uses it to store surplus water when it actually f*cking rains.     
 - How do you know that? 
- I read Delores's pamphlet.     
 Very cool.     
 Delores. Delores.     
 She's a really sweet lady.     
 Billy, I promised to protect her.     
 I get it.     
 WOMAN: Freshen those up?     
 Yeah.     
 So you're the lawyers who are gonna help us, uh, with this water situation.     
 PATTY: Yeah.     
 Oh. Violet mentioned you.     
 I'm, uh, Gloria, her girlfriend.     
 I just want to say that I'm glad someone's looking out for us.     
 That's nice.     
 (sighs) So, essentially, this Big Sur agreement just gives the ranchers the ability to use a public resource to fill their own pockets.     
 While everyone in town doesn't have water.     
 - Yeah. 
- Well, if we can prove that they're distributing water unfairly, we can turn Gene's case into a class action suit.     
 Yeah.     
 Well, I got to get these papers back to Delores, but, uh... you know, I'll-I'll put together a list of what companies are getting the water.     
 There's-there's a lot to dig through here, but...     
 GENE: What?     
 Yeah, I know. I kn...     
 Oh, you know who called the other day?     
 Tim Kovac. Remember him? UT Austin?     
 You know, he's still pitching that goddamn rhetoric manuscript of his.     
 It's... Well, now he's got a new title.     
 Wait. Wait for it.     
 It's called, um... Oh, God.     
 That's So Punny:     
 Turgidity in Romance Languages.     
 Hmm? (laughs softly)     
 No, I said I would read it.     
 I mean, that's professional courtesy.     
 Yeah. Why, he reads my stuff,     
 - I read his stuff, you know. 
- (knocking)     
 - Gene? 
- What?     
 I...     
 I don't... I don't understand.     
 Well, this way, we take your case, and we roll it into a class action lawsuit.     
 We have a hell of a lot better chance this way.     
 PATTY: It's power in numbers.     
 But what about Bobbi?     
 PATTY: Well, there'd be no separate wrongful death claim.     
 Your pain and suffering would be part of the class action lawsuit.     
 My pain and suffering isn't like everyone else's, 'cause my wife is dead.     
 - BILLY: Yeah. 
- My wife is dead, you got that?     
 - PATTY: Yeah. 
- Well, see, doing it like this, we can get you compensation, and you can have some closure on Bobbi's death.     
 Right. (stammers)     
 If you want to hit them where it hurts, then this is absolutely the way to do it.     
 We really need you on board here, Gene.     
 As a matter of fact, uh, I think we may be able to shut 'em down altogether.     
 Well, that's what Bobbi really wanted.     
 PATTY: Thank you.     
 - Arm? 
- (sighs)     
 (gasps) Jesus Christ.     
 - Sorry, honey. 
- (sighs)     
 So are you... are you heading back, or you staying here?     
 - What are you doing? 
- Well, to tell you the truth,     
 I'm kind of used to the casino at this point.     
 Why don't you want to go back to L.A.?     
 I don't know. You know, Denise is settled in at college, and... I don't really need that f*cking place in Venice.     
 You gonna sell it?     
 - I've been thinking about it. 
- You know I can move that.     
 - You know I can move that. 
- (laughing) I know.     
 I am very expensive, however.     
 - I can pay. 
- I know.     
 (insects trilling)     
 Do I need to be worried about you?     
 You get home safe, honey.     
 Hey.

 Wade.     
 You were a little loose with your facts.     
 Really? How's that?     
 Well, you're the president of the water board.     
 Mm-hmm.     
 Responsible for distribution of water in the county, and you rigged the system.     
 - I did? 
- Yes, sir.     
 How's that?     
 Well, on paper, it looks like you get   %.     
 But in reality, through a bunch of shell corporations, you get   .     
 Ah, shoot. You caught me.     
 And I wasn't even hiding.     
 I asked you about the water board.     
 Yeah, but you didn't ask me about my business, and those are two different hats.     
 Well, if you weren't hiding, why the shell corporations?     
 (sighs)     
 I told you that I would tell you everything you wanted to know about the water board, as long as it wasn't covered by the NDA.     
 So ask me.     
 You don't give a damn about the people in town who don't have a drop of water?     
 We take very good care of our employees.     
 We give them everything that they need.     
 But if we don't have water, we don't have crops, and they don't have jobs.     
 - And you don't have millions. 
- (sighs)     
 Everything we do here is perfectly legal.     
 You want to argue about the ethics, go ahead.     
 It won't win you a case in court.     
 Yeah. Unless maybe the jurors don't have any water.     
 Tell you one thing.     
 I'm sure as sh1t gonna sue you in Blackwood County.     
 You can bet your ass on that.     
 Oh. Oh, man.     
 Oh, man! That is such a bummer.     
 And I was just getting to like you, Billy.     
 Yeah, back at you, Wade.     
 Let me ask you something.     
 If everything you're doing is perfectly legal, then, why the NDA?     
 I can't say. That's the point.     
 - Yeah. 
- (sighs)     
 Well, I think you just made mine, too.
