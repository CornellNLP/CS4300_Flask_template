 sh1t. 
  How is it not "eve"? 
  I don't understand that. 
  Wow. 
  Hmm. 
  - Knock, knock. 
  - Who's there? 
  Boo. 
  - Boo, who? 
  - Aw. 
  Why you crying? 
  Can I get you something? 
  Oh, yeah, um Cup of coffee, please. 
  - Sure. 
  - Thank you. 
  - You look great. 
  - Hmm. 
  You still taking cases? 
  The subsidence of our property wasn't a surprise. 
  I mean it's standard for the Central Valley, we were told. 
  - Right. 
  - And I-I wasn't worried. 
  I mean, the neighboring farms, they were doing great. 
  So slam dunk retirement plan, right? 
  Hmm. 
  I always dreamed of moving to California. 
  Make some wine, impress my friends in New York. 
  It was the dream. 
  Hmm. 
  Like back in Constitutional Law? 
  - Mm. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  - You remember? 
  You and me. 
  Dreaming about starting our firm together, remember? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  So, McBride & Turowski. 
  I bet we would have worked out of a funky motel. 
  Keep the overhead low to cut the bullshit. 
  Been spying on me, haven't you? 
  You're living the dream, pal. 
  Yeah, is that what this is? 
  Well, I didn't say it was your dream. 
  Still Turowski? 
  No. 
  It's Bennett. 
  - Bobbi Bennett. 
  - Bobbi Bennett, that's got a ring to it. 
  It's bouncy. 
  What about you? 
  Uh, McBride. 
  Yeah. 
  Mm. 
  - You're a hell of a lawyer. 
  - Oh Yeah, right. 
  You know, the reason I ever learned anything in law school was 'cause I was trying - to impress a girl in class. 
  - Oh, yeah? 
  Can't remember her name. 
  - Are you open for lunch? 
  - Yeah, grab a table. 
  Somebody won a championship, I don't know. 
  Do you want to go outside? 
  Lot of creepy lawyers - you could have called. 
  - Ha. 
  Look, I know enough about law to know that we might not have much of a case, but something's not right. 
  I mean, we're in a drought, but we're the only brown farm for miles, it's You're the only lawyer I know that might be able to figure the whole thing out. 
  I don't know about that. 
  Look, I'm in trouble, Billy. 
  - Why's that? 
  - 'Cause we're bleeding money. 
  Our retirement's almost gone. 
  My husband doesn't know how bad it is. 
  I do the books, I know the numbers. 
  I lie to him, he believes me. 
  I f*cking hate myself for lying to him. 
  I-I don't know what to do; I mean, Gene would've been perfectly happy retiring in Connecticut, but I pushed him for the vineyard. 
  I wanted it. 
  I think I'm gonna die soon. 
  I'm not sick, not like that. 
  But it's something. 
  A premonition. 
  I don't know. 
  Jesus. 
  - I sound like a crazy person. 
  - No, you don't. 
  I get it, believe me. 
  Just something feels unsettled. 
  And I'm I'm walking, and it's dark. 
  There's dirt under my feet. 
  'Cause I don't have shoes on, but I don't know why, and And then there's this, this glowing on the horizon. 
  And that's that's the last thing I see before I-I'm I'm gone. 
  Just devoured. 
  By what? 
  I don't know. 
  I don't know what Gene's gonna do without me. 
  Let's go back, okay? 
  Come on. 
  You won't take my case? 
  Well - why not? 
  - Well, honestly, I'm-I'm not that experienced with property and water rights. 
  You need somebody who is. 
  I can recommend a couple of guys. 
  No. 
  That's bullshit. 
  Look, I just got off a case that nearly killed me. 
  - Okay? 
  - Okay, I know that. 
  - I do follow the news. 
  - Okay, so you get it. 
  No, I don't. 
  I don't get it. 
  You're a lawyer. 
  You're good at it. 
  It's what you do. 
  I'm not your guy, honey. 
  You're mad at me, aren't you? 
  Of course not. 
  You are. 
  - No. 
  - Oh, goddamn it. 
  You know, this would've been so much easier if you just told me to piss off the second you saw me. 
  - You knew how I felt about you. 
  - I mean, I You gave me the key to your apartment. 
  Said if I meet you there that night, then we'll just take off together. 
  Well It was too much. 
  I co I couldn't do it. 
  You could've said goodbye. 
  - I thought I did. 
  - Well, you didn't. 
  Look, I don't remember. 
  Um I'm sorry. 
  You still have my apartment key? 
  Thanks for listening to me today. 
  Sure. 
  You're wrong, Billy. 
  I didn't know how you felt about me. 
  You never said it. 
  Your advisor filled me in. 
  Said you're thinking about applying to law school after you've finished your degree. 
  Been working for a lawyer. 
  Yeah, doing paralegal work. 
  You seem nice. 
  Transcript looks great. 
  But here's the short of it. 
  Passing the bar is one thing. 
  Being admitted to the bar requires good moral character. 
  Your past drug use is an issue, but it's not disqualifying. 
  Okay. 
  However your admission to blackmail and your court testimony for the Borns Tech case? 
  Borns Tech? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Great. 
  It would be unethical for us to admit a student who couldn't be admitted to the bar. 
  So there's no chance of me getting into law school. 
  Look, you work for Billy McBride. 
  And while Billy McBride has had his own run-ins with the bar, his name still carries some weight in this town. 
  Having him testify on your behalf would really be your only shot. 
  Okay. 
  sh1t. 
  Come on. 
  What are you doing? 
  What are you doing? 
  Hi. 
  What are you doing? 
  I saw you here yesterday, too. 
  - You're Patty, right? 
  - No, I'm not. 
  I ran your plates. 
  Lot of moving violations. 
  - That's - Jeff's out of town, so don't waste your day sitting here waiting for him. 
  I'm not. 
  Okay, look, I don't know what happened between you two, or why he won't return your calls. 
  None of my business. 
  But I think moving on is a good idea. 
  - Don't you? 
  - I just want I wanted to apologize. 
  - I'll tell him. 
  - Okay. 
  Thank you. 
  Hey, handsome. 
  Hey. 
  What's up? 
  How are you? 
  Doing all right. 
  Hey, um Hey, is it cool if I just work part-time from now on? 
  Yeah, whatever you need. 
  You get another gig? 
  No, I just don't feel like working anymore. 
  No, I, um, I'm going back to school. 
  - No sh1t? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Good. 
  - Thinking of going to law school. 
  Really? 
  - Following in your footsteps. 
  - Don't do that. 
  So I need you to vouch for me in front of the bar association. 
  Why is that? 
  There's some question about my moral character. 
  - Oh. 
  - Not surprised? 
  I didn't mean it that way. 
  No, it's-it's not about the drug stuff. 
  Mm. 
  Borns Tech? 
  Yeah. 
  My my testimony. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  I'm sure you don't want to get into it right now. 
  No, I want to help you. 
  I'll do it. 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah, of course. 
  - When is it? 
  - A couple weeks. 
  I'll text you the details. 
  All right. 
  Be happy to. 
  So how you doing? 
  Everything good? 
  - I'm all right. 
  - Mm-hmm? 
  Saw an old friend of mine. 
  - Was it a good visit? 
  - Kind of. 
  A lot of memories. 
  You know how that goes. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  - That's nice. 
  - Yeah. 
  What the hell are you doing here? 
  You said your name was Billy McBride and you lived in Santa Monica. 
  Yeah, that's-that's right. 
  But that's too You were making those weird noises again that you make when you sleep. 
  And then you would totally just stop breathing - for, like, a minute. 
  - Yeah. 
  And then you would start breathing again Well, see, I-I know. 
  Sometimes, I forget to wear my thing. 
  So how the hell did you get in here, anyway? 
  - Oh, Art. 
  From downstairs? 
  - Oh, great. 
  He have you ever seen those dreamcatchers he makes? 
  They're, they're so colorful, and I, I wonder where he gets those feathers from. 
  - Do you have any? 
  - I-I don't, I don't know. 
  Anyway, I-I told him that you saved my life. 
  And, um And then he walked me upstairs and, you know, let me in. 
  But your door wasn't locked, so I don't know if I really needed to talk to Art. 
  Though, I didn't know which room was yours, so Yeah. 
  No, I get it. 
  - So I guessed it was - I get the whole picture. 
  It's fine. 
  Yeah. 
  Janet. 
  Yes! 
  Yes! 
  Oh, my God! 
  - You remember! 
  - Yeah. 
  Memory like a steel trap. 
  - Mexico. 
  - Yeah, Mexico. 
  That's right. 
  How could you forget? 
  Yes. 
  Yes! 
  That's right. 
  Yeah, we, um What brings you to Santa Monica? 
  Oh, I-I need a ride. 
  You need a ride? 
  Lemmy is my mom's sister's only son, I think. 
  They don't talk, my mom and my aunt. 
  When's the last time you saw Lemmy? 
  Uh, let me think, um So he was just out of jail Something minor like jaywalking or breaking and entering. 
  Right. 
  And I remember he needed a new engine for his motorcycle. 
  So maybe six years ago? 
  You've owed him he's owed you money for six years? 
  My, my husband had just gotten his settlement check, so we had extra. 
  - Does he know you're coming? 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  I left him a message. 
  He's always home. 
  Well, if he's always home, why didn't he pick up? 
  He screens his calls. 
  He doesn't trust the government. 
  Oh. 
  - Hey, there. 
  - Hey. 
  Why are you here? 
  It's Saturday. 
  Ah, just straightening up. 
  Had some paperwork to do. 
  You know Billy, he's a mess. 
  Yeah. 
  - Ah, what are you up to? 
  - Nothing. 
  Where's Billy? 
  He's not downstairs? 
  - Nope. 
  - Oh. 
  I'm not sure where he is. 
  Do you want me to tell him you were looking for him? 
  Uh, no, it's not important. 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay. 
  Um, okay. 
  You know, uh, I was gonna go see a movie. 
  No, I don't want to see a movie. 
  Okay. 
  Then I'll I'll see you on Monday? 
  - I will see you on Monday. 
  Bye. 
  - Okay. 
  Bye. 
  f*ck. 
  This is quite a shithole. 
  You sure we're in the right place? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  I was here, like, two years ago. 
  I thought you said it had been six years. 
  Oh, Lemmy wasn't here. 
  My mom and I were getting her TV back. 
  Ooh, look, he's fixed the place up. 
  - Huh. 
  - Ooh, this is new. 
  Listen, why don't you just let me give you 2,000 bucks and forget this sh1t, all right? 
  No, I don't want to put you out.
