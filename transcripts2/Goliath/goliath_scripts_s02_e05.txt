 Many years ago there was a little girl and a little boy. 
  They lived in a small village in Mexico and they were best friends. 
  One day the little girl's parents were killed in a terrible accident. 
  - (GUNFIRE) 
  - Pop. 
  Pop, pop, pop. 
  Without her parents, the little girl didn't have anywhere to live. 
  (CRYING) 
  So the little boy's parents took her in to live with them in their castle high on a hill. 
  Every night before they went to sleep, the little girl and the little boy prayed together. 
  But the little girl was still very sad about her parents, and scared to live in the big castle with her new family. 
  So the little boy gave her one of his favorite toys to make her feel better. 
  This made the little girl feel much better. 
  But one day, a very mean boy stole the toy from her and laughed at her when she got upset. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  So the little boy sneaked up on the mean boy and snatched the toy from him and returned the toy to the little girl. 
  She felt safe and protected by the little boy. 
  When the little girl was older, she decided it was time to leave the big castle and move to the United States. 
  And she brought the toy with her so she would always remember the little boy. 
  To this day, the toy still comforts her every night before she sleeps. 
  (PHONE CLICKING) 
  (PHONE WHOOSHING) 
  (QUIETLY): Okay. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Jesus f*ck. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I thought you might need a towel or something. 
  For what, my ankles? 
  What are you still (CHUCKLES) 
  Are you (LAUGHS) 
  Are you expecting a tip? 
  Is that what's happening here? 
  You want a because you Okay. 
  Well, man, you got balls, I'll tell you that. 
  I'm sure I got something in here for you. 
  Oh, shoot, I left all my cash in my other pants. 
  Well, this is a complete waste of my time. 
  Just give it five minutes. 
  I think you're trying to play me. 
  (LAUGHS SOFTLY) 
  Goddamn it. 
  He-He's gonna be here. 
  Just give him five minutes, all right? 
  Same old McBride bullshit. 
  Same old bullshit. 
  BILLY: Look, this cat's gonna tell you Julio's not the killer. 
  HAKEEM: You know this case is over, so you're saying you're desperate. 
  (PHONE VIBRATES) 
  (CAR BEEPS) 
  (TIRES SCREECHING) 
  There's got to be something we can do. 
  I mean, if we lose our witness, you're all we got. 
  It's complicated. 
  Okay? 
  The Tito Garcia thing is part of a much bigger investigation that I can't talk about. 
  - Oh, come on, Jeff, don't spin this. 
  - Look, there are a lot of players involved now. 
  The La Mano Cartel? 
  You know I can't say that. 
  I know this is not your top priority, but it is ours. 
  I guarantee you, our witness is part of your bigger investigation. 
  Okay, look, we're investigating Tito's deportation. 
  All right? 
  If I come across something that can help you PATTY: Then help us. 
  I'll see what I can do. 
  I'm not making any promises. 
  All right. 
  Appreciate it. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  Fine. 
  Fine. 
  You coming? 
  Yeah, I'm coming. 
  Thank you. 
  ELENA: We get a lot of weird stuff in the mail. 
  People send baked goods, but trust me, don't eat anything that comes in the mail. 
  Don't eat the mail, got it. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Can you work a phone? 
  Is that a trick question? 
  A lot of volunteers your age have never used a landline. 
  If you have any questions, I'm right over there. 
  Great, thank you. 
  You're welcome. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  Hi. 
  - May I help you? 
  - I'm here to see Marisol Silva? 
  DENISE: Yes, um, of course. 
  D-Do you have an appointment? 
  Do I need an appointment? 
  I think so. 
  Yes, um What's your name? 
  Miguel Torres, from the - DENISE: Miguel - Disabled Veterans Association. 
  Um Just okay, yeah, l-let me One second. 
  Sorry. 
  (TYPING) 
  MARISOL: No. 
  You need to make an appointment. 
  I-I'm here to speak with you. 
  The only way you're gonna speak with me is through the proper channels. 
  MIGUEL: My boss says I'm to speak to you today. 
  Yeah, that's not gonna happen. 
  Make an appointment next time. 
  Sorry about that. 
  No, I'm so sorry. 
  Did I handle that wrong, or? 
  No, that was perfect. 
  Thank you, Denise. 
  Okay. 
  ELENA: Who was that guy? 
  Uh, he said he was from the Disabled Veterans Association. 
  Are you sure? 
  That's what he said. 
  MARY (DISTANT): It was so embarrassing. 
  Oh BILLY: So, what do you even say to a kid who tells you something like that? 
  MARY: I know, I know. 
  I just sort of didn't. 
  (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
  BILLY: Yeah, I hear you. 
  Unless you got kids, you just can't know, - (FUSSING) 
  - you know what I mean? 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  No, I know. 
  - ROMAN: Hey. 
  - I know hi. 
  - Hey. 
  What's going on? 
  I told Mary you were running late, so we've just been having a little chat here, and ROMAN: Yeah. 
  Sorry, I-I should've called. 
  It's okay. 
  BILLY: Well, Keith and I are on working this case. 
  I-Innocent kid, wrong place, wrong time, and all that, and we got a guy. 
  If he'd come forward, he could prove the kid's innocent, but Come on, Billy. 
  Don't need to bother Mary with all that. 
  - I'm just curious what she thinks. 
  - She probably - doesn't care. 
  - (SCOFFS) 
  BILLY: I'm sure she's got an opinion. 
  I mean, what do you think? 
  Honestly, I mean, should the guy come forward, and even though he'd have to admit  
  - that he did something wrong? 
  - Kid's innocent? 
  Yeah, I mean, that seems like what a decent person should do. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Problem is, we're not sure he's a decent person. 
  He may just be a scumbag, so What do you think, Keith? 
  I think we should talk outside. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, we don't want to bore Mary with all this. 
  We'll see you later, honey. 
  MARY: Okay. 
  Oh I hope that guy does the right thing. 
  Yeah, me, too. 
  Say bye. 
  - Bye. 
  Bye. 
  - Bye. 
  (LAUGHS)

  Just trying to give you one more chance Just stay the f*ck away from me. 
  Okay? 
  Stay the f*ck away from my family. 
  You know what I could do to you. 
  Whatever it is, it ain't gonna make your problem go away. 
  I'm trying to help you and your family. 
  f*ck you. 
  You don't give a f*ck about me. 
  Let's say that's true. 
  It ain't your wife's fault, and it ain't your kids' fault. 
  Do not use my family to get to me, okay? 
  I know that f*cking trick. 
  This ain't a trick. 
  Listen, all this is gonna come back on you.

  So let's go get in the car and see Hakeem,

  HAKEEM: The f*ck is this? 
  He'll tell you. 
  I need a guarantee. 
  Witness protection. 
  Immunity. 
  You're the guy? 
  I need your word or I'm not saying sh1t. 
  BILLY: Look, he's not gonna do anything for you, Roman, unless you tell him what you told me. 
  I, uh Julio Suarez did not kill Hunter Friedman and Marcos PeÃ±a. 
  Tito Garcia was my C. I. 
  He killed those boys. 
  Tito told you that? 
  - No. 
  - Then how do you know? 
  That's all I'm telling you till my family is safe and I have immunity. 
  - What'd you do? 
  - I'm not telling you a thing. 
  - What the f*ck did you do? 
  - No, that-that's all I'm saying now. 
  - You plant that f*ckin' gun? 
  - That's all BILLY: No, no.

  Hakeem, buddy, come on, come on, come on. 
  - He set the kid up. 
  - I know, I know, I know. 
  I prosecuted an innocent f*cking kid. 
  - Yes, I know that. 
  - Not to mention every case - that we worked on can be thrown out. 
  - He's helping us now, - okay? 
  - What the f*ck were you thinking? 
  BILLY: Please. 
  No, I'm not giving him any f*cking help. 
  Need you to tell me everything I need to f*cking know. 
  ROMAN: No f*cking way. 
  - No? 
  - No. 
  Oh, you think you're calling the shots right now? 
  There's more to it.

  We know what we need to know. 
  But you're gonna have to get his family witness protection. 
  Okay? 
  And immunity. 
  You need to tell me every goddamn thing I need to know. 
  Everything. 
  Okay.

  - I'm not gonna put my family at risk. 
  - I - I'm gonna put a cop on you. 
  You got me, man.

  Hey, Hakeem. 
  He's your boy now, give him a ride home. 
  HAKEEM: Get in the f*cking car. 
  (ENGINE STARTS) 
  Good luck, Detective. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  So, it all started, uh, with my sister. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  When she was 12, she lost her leg. 
  And, uh it was like a staph infection. 
  And, um Sorry, I feel like  
  (LAUGHS) 
  - Huh? 
  - I feel like I'm gonna throw up. 
  Really? 
  It's okay. 
  - (EXHALES) 
  - Hey, it's okay. 
  Keep going. 
  Anyway, um the the first morning that my sister was home from the hospital, at breakfast, my mom was trying to, you know, just keep it light with cartoons and cereal. 
  You know, like we're It's a normal normal morning, normal kitchen. 
  (KEYPAD BEEPING) 
  This is the table. 
  Um I My sister sat in her wheelchair. 
  She had her prosthetic on. 
  But it was bothering her, so my mother helped her take it off here at the table. 
  And I was nine, and I sat right here watching it all. 
  And, uh her knee was, uh I just couldn't take my eyes off of it. 
  It was red, and it's where her leg was cut off. 
  BRITTANY: Oh. 
  Anyway, it was sore, so my mother was rubbing it to soothe her. 
  And I realized that she was going to exclusively have my mother's love from that point, um which, strangely I mean, I don't know, I was a f*cking kid. 
  I didn't know what a hard-on was, but that's what happened. 
  Um, and my therapist later reduced it to something called eroticized childhood trauma, which, uh, is just like, uh Well I'm so f*cked up. 
  You know? 
  And, uh But it happened. 
  I don't know what I'm So, you built this? 
  That therapist said I really needed to imagine myself in my childhood kitchen, really put myself here. 
  I guess if you have the money, right? 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  - Why not, huh? 
  Yeah. 
  I don't know. 
  It's-it's over the top. 
  It's a lot. 
  I don't Can I? 
  Come on, I don't want you to You  
  - I want to. 
  - Don't-don't make fun of me. 
  I want to. 
  Okay.

  Like that? 
  Yeah. 
  WYATT: I've never been intimate with anyone before. 
  I've been in relationships and had s*x and But never Is it weird that I'm thinking about us being together? 
  No. 
  I like helping you. 
  - You do? 
  - Yeah. 
  Why? 
  Because I understand you. 
  Do you understand me? 
  I think I do.

  I got to go back to the office. 
  Prep some final paperwork for Billy. 
  Yeah? 
  What's final? 
  What's going on? 
  I don't know, I guess he thinks Julio's gonna get out next week? 
  - (SIGHS) 
  - Wha-What happened? 
  Uh, Billy found a guy who's willing to testify about the murders. 
  So, he's-he's got somebody who's gonna flip? 
  It always happens on cases like this with Billy. 
  He just digs and digs and digs and keeps, I don't know, asking people questions. 
  And (SIGHS) 
  eventually someone comes forward and tells the truth. 
  Well, that's-that's awesome. 
  Yeah, but it's a mess of paperwork. 
  Did I bring a purse? 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  (GASPS) 
  Billy. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hey. 
  How's it going? 
  It's good. 
  Good. 
  I I was worried about you. 
  Well, you shouldn't be worried about my ass. 
  I mean, I should've called you, and I I'm a f*cking idiot. 
  I'm really sorry. 
  I was just thinking you didn't trust me enough  
  - to talk to me. 
  - No, I do trust you. 
  - Really. 
  I wanted to also  
  - Well, maybe you shouldn't. 
  apologize, you know You don't need to apologize to any Forget it. 
  You didn't say anything, it was me. 
  The whole f*cking thing was me. 
  I was an asshole. 
  And the fact that you came down here surprises me. 
  Why are you not mad at me? 
  I don't understand. 
  Well, I was worried. 
  I wasn't mad. 
  (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey.

  I think I'm coming down with it. 
  Oh. 
  Anything I can do? 
  No. 
  You'd tell me if there was, right? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I'm sure I'll be fine in a couple days. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  - All right, be better, man. 
  - Okay. 
  ("MM-HMM" BY THE JAMES HUNTER SIX PLAYING) 
  - Hey. 
  You-you look beautiful. 
  - No. 
  Sit down. 
  Sit down. 
  This is gonna take a second. 
  I'm gonna try to break this down for you. 
  Okay. 
  First of all, I want to preface this by saying that I-I really do think you're a very brave man. 
  - Thank you. 
  - That being said, uh, hypothetically, this is gonna go great. 
  All right? 
  You're tall and you're nice, and you can't figure me out, which you find interesting for now. 
  So, so we go out a couple times, right? 
  And that goes well. 
  It goes so well, in fact, that we sleep together. 
  That goes extremely well because you are, in fact, tall and nice and I am extraordinary in bed. 
  I'm very serious. 
  I'm extraordinary. 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  So we do that a couple of times, and you're still interested, I start getting comfortable, so I give you a set of keys. 
  Right? 
  You leave a toothbrush at my place. 
  And then we start getting into a routine. 
  All right? 
  And this is what that clown show is gonna look like, okay? 
  I'm gonna come home from work, late. 
  So you've already eaten. 
  So I have a quick salad and I jump in the shower. 
  I double cleanse my face. 
  I do my business in there, then I hop out, and then it's, uh, toner, serum, oil, eye cream, and I coat it all with hyaluronic acid. 
  Then I put eyelash grower on my eyebrows because I was starting to look like a chola, and I was trying to fill them in, but you can't really tell 'cause I have blonde tips, but it's happening. 
  I'm terrified of getting old. 
  Then I put on my self-tanner. 
  Okay? 
  Then I put on my jam-jams. 
  Very important because, at first, I'll only wear my jam-jams. 
  Okay? 
  It's a comfort thing. 
  Then I'm gonna start wearing your shorts. 
  - I'm gonna wear your shorts. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - That's not funny. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  I'm gonna put on my humidifier, my air purifier, and the television. 
  It's gonna be set to a channel that you f*cking hate. 
  Then I'm gonna hop into bed, all right? 
  Now, this is where, this is where the real fun begins, all right? 
  This is when the Vicks comes out. 
  I put that sh1t on my feet. 
  I put it on my chest. 
  I put it under my nose and I put it on my sinuses. 
  All right? 
  I guarantee you, I guarantee you, that if you stick around you're gonna smell like Vicks for the rest of your life. 
  - Mm. 
  - For the rest of your life. 
  Okay? 
  It will never get out of your clothes. 
  It will never leave you. 
  Hmm. 
  How do I know this? 
  Because I have been married twice, and they both stink. 
  Okay? 
  So that's that's pr Oh, sh1t, last thing: Invisalign. 
  Oh, for my f*cked up teeth. 
  Is it genetic? 
  Who knows? 
  My birth parents gave me up and I grew up in foster care. 
  Um so that's another bag of trash that I carry around with me that will eventually become your problem. 
  Hey, you want to dance? 
  I Absolutely not. 
  Come on, just one dance. 
  Just one. 
  If I do it, will you leave me alone? 
  - Yes. 
  - Yes, what? 
  Yes, okay. 
  You will leave me alone if I dance with you? 
  One dance, please. 
  A lovestruck Romeo - Sang the streets of serenade - Fine. 
  Laying everybody low with a love song That he made Finds a streetlight Steps out of the shade Says something like, You and me, babe No.

  WALLACE: So no question about credibility? 
  No. 
  WALLACE: Well, Mr. McBride, it looks like you have all the evidence you need. 
  I have to draft the immunity letter and, uh, get the witness' statement on record. 
  We have a motion to dismiss the charges here. 
  Can you get that through today, you think? 
  Mr. 
  Rashad, are you prepared? 
  - No, I'm sorry, I'm not. 
  - PATTY: Well, we'd like to tell him, so when do you think you will be? 
 
 
 
  Well, as long as everything checks out with the witnesses, I should be done by, I don't know, Monday. 
  Okay, well, let's have the motion to dismiss on the books by Monday morning. 
  Can we at least get him in protective custody over the weekend? 
  - That works for me. 
  - Cool. 
  - Mr. McBride. 
  - Yeah? 
  Mr. 
  Rashad and I are going to take care of everything, but, uh I just want you to know that you've really done your job and your client is going home and I want to thank you for not letting this court send an innocent kid to prison. 
  Thank you. 
  (LOCK BUZZES, LATCH CLICKS) 
  - PATTY: Hey. 
  - BILLY: What's up, bud? 
  PATTY: How you doing? 
  They put me in a P. 
  C. 
  unit. 
  - They said you ordered it. 
  - Yeah. 
  - That's right. 
  - Why do I have to be in there? 
  It's like solitary confinement. 
  It's only for a couple of days, and there's good reason for it. 
  So then I can get out of there? 
  I can go back to my old cell? 
  No, then you get to leave. 
  What do you, what do you mean? 
  They're dropping the charges against you. 
  Are you serious? 
  Come Monday, you're gonna be a happy boy. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - Thank you. 
  Thank you so much. 
  - Oh. 
  No, I'd hug you, I just don't like doing that. 
  (LAUGHTER) 
  Oh, my I'm open! 
  Oh!

  Can't believe I made that. 
  I suck at basketball. 
  Oh, sh1t.

  - I don't want you  
  - I (LAUGHING) 
 : I don't know what you're talking about, man. 
  - Do you really not know? 
  - I really don't know. 
  Billy McBride has someone who's going to flip. 
  Wait, what? 
  Wh Where'd you hear that? 
  Danny, how do you not know this? 
  I-I-I haven't, I haven't heard that, I mean O-Okay, well, now you know. 
  So, who do you think it is? 
  I-I don't know. 
  Uh Marisol? 
  Mar Why Marisol? 
  Well I mean, isn't she's - been hanging out? 
  - She's not making those kind of moves without us. 
  Right? 
  I'm thinking about, you know, maybe one of your friends, some people you've been trying to stay close to. 
  One of my friends? 
  What, like Roman? 
  No. 
  - It is, it is not Keith Roman. 
  - But how do you know? 
  - I mean, look, he's your friend  
  - I'm just you're close with him, but you said he's been stressed out, maybe there's a Yeah, yeah, ab-about his wife and his kids, but, I mean, not about this sh1t. 
  This is getting serious. 
  Do you understand? 
  - Yeah, I understand. 
  - But do you really? 
  - Yes, I understand. 
  - Okay. 
  - So, if it's not Roman - Yeah. 
  then who is it? 
  I mean, is is it me? 
  - Okay, that's funny. 
  - It is funny. 
  And maybe it's you. 
  Yeah, it's me. 
  It's me. 
  I'm sorry. 
  That's not funny. 
  Wh-Wh-Whoa! 
  I'm kidding. 
  I'm not gonna do that to you anymore. 
  - Let's figure it out, okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  I've made it a priority as mayor and will continue to push policies that will address the opioid crisis. 
  (APPLAUSE) 
  I'm Joe from Hacienda Heights, and my question is for Councilwoman Silva. 
  You've talked a lot about building an inclusive community through your outreach programs. 
  Even with your poll numbers dropping, you are very public in supporting a murderer from one of those programs. 
  Are you concerned that may undermine even your base this close to the election? 
  Joe, thank you for your question, and, um, just to clarify, Julio Suarez has been accused of murder. 
  I stand by his innocence because in this country you're innocent until proven otherwise. 
  (APPLAUSE) 
  But, Joe, I don't blame you for your choice of words. 
  Mayor Anderson also neglects to include the word "accused" when it comes to my support of Julio. 
  You know, Julio grew up in tough circumstances. 
  He could have just easily slipped through the cracks and become a victim of the system. 
  Instead, he's an honor student and a talented musician. 
  As many of you know, I was born in a small village in Mexico. 
  And my parents died when I was very young. 
  And though I was fortunate to come to this country, I was poor and I didn't speak the language. 
  So I, too, could have just easily slipped through cracks. 
  As mayor, I want to become the voice that unites all of us, no matter what the circumstances. 
  This is the Los Angeles I know and love. 
  And this is the Los Angeles I will proudly represent as your mayor. 
  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) 
  Oh, thank you. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  - How do you know this? 
  - Well, I followed your lead, I inserted myself into Billy's camp, I got to know one of his employees. 
  I'm not sure who's flipping, but I think we're extremely close to being exposed. 
  - Jesus - I just want you to have the information, but I would still love to support you standing by Julio, but our options are limited. 
  - Tom, what if I just quit? 
  - Marisol. 
  It's time. 
  (PHONE VIBRATING) 
  Hello? 
  GABRIEL (OVER PHONE): Who's this? 
  Elena Morales. 
  Marisol Silva's campaign manager. 
  Who's this? 
  Oh, it's very nice to meet you, Elena. 
  I'm Gabriel. 
  Would you mind giving Marisol a message from me? 
  Okay. 
  Ask her when's the last time she prayed? 
  Can you remember that? 
  I'm sorry. 
  Who is this? 
  - Hello? 
  - (BEEPS) 
  MARISOL: Hey. 
  Do we have any new numbers yet? 
  Everyone has you winning the debate by a landslide. 
  Instant polls already have you up by ten. 
  Fantastic. 
  I'm exhausted. 
  Who's Gabriel? 
  Uh He wanted me to give you a message. 
  Uh, "When's the last time you prayed?" What does that mean? 
  You ask a lot of questions, Elena. 
  I'm just trying to keep you safe. 
  You're very good at your job, but I think it's time for you to move on. 
  You're firing me? 
  No. 
  Never. 
  I'm giving you the freedom to explore a new opportunity. 
  Elena, the campaign is over. 
  Senator Briggs from your hometown inquired about your service a while ago, but at the time, I didn't want to let you go because you're such a valuable asset. 
  But he's very impressed with what you've done for me so far. 
  I don't want to go back to Sacramento. 
  I'm calling him and giving you my highest recommendations. 
  This is best for both of us. 
  Good luck. 
  I wish you the best. 
  DENISE: Anyways, Marisol's really brave, you know? 
  I mean, this guy came in today who had a hook for a hand. 
  No sh1t. 
  - Yeah, it's crazy, right? 
  - Yeah. 
  It was pretty weird. 
  Marisol just walked right up to him and told him he needed to make an appointment, but he kept insisting and being really pushy with her and she stood her ground, though. 
  Sent him on his way. 
  Did you ever find out what he wanted or who he was? 
  - Uh-uh. 
  - Like a street person or something? 
  - He said he was a disabled veteran. 
  - Oh. 
  Those guys go through a lot of sh1t, you know. 
  He could've had you know, some kind of PTSD or whatever. 
  Marisol was brave, though. 
  If it were me, I probably would have just hidden in my office. 
  I really like her. 
  You do? 
  - I think you made that clear. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - About 300 times. 
  - Okay. 
  You just seem really happy is all. 
  I'm all right, I guess. 
  (LOCK BUZZES, LATCH CLICKS) 
  Thank you, Luis. 
  Of course, Ms. 
  Silva, any time. 
  Did Mr. 
  McBride tell you? 
  Yes. 
  They're dropping the charges. 
  I'm so happy. 
  My girlfriend's gonna throw this really big party. 
  And I'd really like you to come. 
  Of course, of course. 
  I'll be there. 
  You didn't deserve any you didn't deserve any of this. 
  Well, it's all going to be over soon. 
  Look, thank you so much for believing in me. 
  I'll never forget it. 
  I love you. 
  I love you, too. 
  - (KNOCKS) 
  - (LOCK BUZZES, LATCH CLICKS) 
  MARY: Okay, Keith. 
  Tell me. 
  I can't. 
  You owe me an explanation. 
  I-I don't want you to get involved. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  I am f*cking involved. 
  We're all f*cking involved. 
  Look, all I can say is, Danny came to me  
  - Yeah? 
  - with this thing. 
  - What thing? 
  - Okay? 
  - And-and-and it got out of hand. 
  - What? 
  Do not touch me! 
  - I could kill him. 
  - No. 
  Where is he? 
  I'll kill him. 
  I need to own it. 
  I did not sign up for this, Keith. 
  I don't deserve this. 
  Your kids don't deserve this. 
  I know. 
  (MARY SNIFFLES) 
  (SOBS) 
  What's gonna happen to Danny? 
  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  (LINE DIALING) 
  WYATT (OVER PHONE) 
 : Danny? 
  It's him. 
  It's f*cking him. 
  Well, Danny, you better take care of it. 
  Wait, what? 
  He's my-my f*cking best friend, man. 
  What are you talking about? 
  And I'm very sorry about that. 
  - No, Tom, no  
  - (PHONE BEEPS) 
  f*ck. 
  f*ck! 
  (SEABIRD SQUAWKS) 
  I have a surprise for you. 
  I don't like surprises. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I don't like them either, but this is a good one. 
  Yeah? 
  Okay. 
  What you got? 
  I want you to come away with me. 
  What do you mean? 
  Right now. 
  You're not too busy running for mayor? 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Just one night, and, you know, my numbers are up. 
  I think it would be good just to get away from all this. 
  Yeah. 
  Sounds good to me. 
  - Good. 
  - Yeah. 
  So, where-where are we going? 
  Really? 
  It's a surprise. 
  Okay. 
  I'm intrigued. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Good. 
  I think it's gonna be good. 
  Would you go to the beach? 
  Right now. 
  Well just go stand on the beach and wait for you? 
  Yes. 
  Okay. 
  You're gonna leave and go home, aren't you? 
  (MARISOL LAUGHS) 
  Well, should I just leave a credit card, - and they can bring? 
  - No, everything's taken care of. 
  - Really? 
  - Of course. 
  No sh1t. 
  (LAUGHING): I'll see you in a little bit. 
  Yeah.
