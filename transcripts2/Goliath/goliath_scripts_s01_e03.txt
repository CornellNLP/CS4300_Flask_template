 Excuse me, Mr. McBride? 
 Yes, sir. 
 May I talk to you one second? 
 Yeah, what's up? 
 This is a bit delicate, but I've been advised by the family, they'd prefer you not be here. 
 I don't think she had any family. 
 Well, her sister-in-law. 
 Well, listen, we were really close friends with her, so... 
 I'm very sorry. 
 Well, we just... 
 We just want to pay our respect. 
 I've asked you both to leave. 
 But, you know, I mean, we were every bit as close... 
 Probably closer than her sister there. 
 I'd be happy to escort you off personally. 
 Please don't be fooled by the collar. 
 The problem is you're asking too nicely. 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 You make a practice out of threatening people at your funerals? 
 Hang on a second. 
 You come see me sometime. 
 It's my card. It's a bar. 
 A lot better place to whip my ass than here, okay? 
 I want to talk to you. 
 Hey. Your Aunt Rachel was a great person, and I'm sure your dad was, too. 
 I didn't know him, but I just want to say I'm sorry. 
 Please. 
 Yeah, I get it. Okay? 
 He got held in contempt on purpose. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm assuming after what happened, that the contempt thing will go away. 
 Uh, don't count on it. 
 The gnome is vindictive. 
 And if Donald wants to twist the knife into Billy... 
 And believe me, he wants to twist the knife hard... 
 Then the gnome will let him. 
 But if Mr. Cooperman twists the knife, it's at his own peril, because the case isn't quashed until the contempt is vacated. 
 Maybe I could, um... 
 I could walk Mr. Cooperman through the risks. 
 If that would help. 
 Ambitious girl. 
 Good for you. 
 Careful what you wish for. 
 No, I enjoyed my time as chief judge. 
 It was no picnic, believe me. 
 You're in a good place. Don't worry. 
 You're still young. You've got time. 
 I don't feel it most mornings. 
 It's the state court. Has some advantages. 
 They assigned me a beautiful, beautiful renovated courtroom. 
 [clears throat] 
 Donald. 
 Judge Kozinski. 
 How are you? 
 Always a pleasure. 
 Do you know my former law clerk, Judge Keller? 
 Hello, Rosten. 
 Your name came up the other day. 
 Let me think, let me think. 
 The Borns Tech case perhaps? 
 No, it wasn't that. 
 Let's see. 
 It was the Senator Judiciary Nomination Committee. 
 Federal bench. 
 So many positions. 
 Shame congress won't fill them. 
 One day. [chuckling] 
 Good to see you, Alex. 
 Always a pleasure. 
 Judge Keller. 
 Sir. 
 Not very subtle. 
 You think I should tell someone about that? 
 Lawyers run into judges all the time. 
 It's not that unusual. 
 But I heard he never left his office. 
 Rumors. 
 Brilliant lawyer, that one. 
 Odd man. 
 Good one to know, though, if you want to move up in the world. 
 Hm. 
 Woman : All rise. 
 The Honorable Rosten Keller presiding. 
 [clears throat] 
 Good morning, counsel. 
 Good morning. 
 Here we are again to determine if Mr. McBride's behavior toward this court, and specifically toward me, rises to the level of criminal contempt. 
 Mr. McBride, please rise. 
 To sentencing? That's efficient. 
 The court is aware of the tragedy that occurred after our last proceeding. 
 My sincere condolences to both you and your client's family. 
 Thank you so much. 
 The court is also mindful of the fact that Mr. McBride faces charges of drunk driving, and resisting arrest in another courtroom. 
 Yeah, good news travels fast. 
 Would you like to contribute to my defense fund? 
 In light of the circumstances, I've decided to vacate my contempt finding. 
 Well, that's very compassionate of you, your honor, but I'd like to have my hearing just the same. 
 I'd like to call Donald Cooperman to the stand, please. 
 Hm. 
 The contempt order is vacated. 
 Any hearing would therefore would be moot. 
 Sorry, Mr. McBride. 
 We're not playing any games today. 
 I don't have time. 
 I-I think you should make time. 
 I'd like to redeem my good name in the same forum where is was so radically impugned. 
 That's very clever. 
 Seeking to use this proceeding as a means to dig up evidence in support of a baseless claim. 
 The matter is adjourned. 
 Don't be an asshole. 
 The case is dismissed. 
 I do wish you health, and happiness. 
 I hope your nuts fall off, you prick. 
 What's up, Jason? 
 Hey, I called your office after the funeral. 
 And the lady said that you'd be here, or at the bar. 
 Yeah. What's up, man? 
 Well, my dad didn't kill himself. 
 And my Aunt Rachel said that you knew that. 
 Yeah, well, I'm... I'm not for sure, but I got my suspicions. 
 Your Aunt Rachel was pretty convinced he wouldn't kill himself, either. 
 What did... What did your mom tell you? 
 She won't talk about it. 
 And if he was planning on killing himself, he would have said goodbye. 
 Or something. 
 Is there any way that we could talk to you sometime, and your mother wouldn't know about it? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, that's my card. 
 There's a number on there. 
 It's my number, it's in handwriting. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Don't show that card to anybody. 
 What are you doing? 
 You cannot talk to a child without his mother present. 
 No, you were talking to him. I wasn't talking to him. 
 And if anybody asks you, that's the deal, okay? 
 What? 
 Trust me, it's a good thing. Come on. 
 Patty : He's a kid. He doesn't even have capacity to bring a lawsuit. 
 Billy : We'll file an application for appointment as guardian ad litem. 
 You can be his lawyer and get appointed by the court. 
 Oh, right, the mother's gonna let that happen. 
 It's not up to her. 
 The court is never gonna appoint me guardian, I have a conflict of interest. 
 No, I have a conflict of interest. You don't. 
 And remember, we're not a firm. 
 Yeah, but it doesn't matter if we're... 
 You know what? You want to keep arguing with me all f*ckin' day long, because I can do it. 
 Whoa. 
 I am so goddamn tired of you yappin', and f*ckin' openin' your trap every f*ckin' time I have anything to say. 
 Take it easy. 
 I'm not gonna take it easy. 
 I actually know what I'm doing. 
 When are you gonna realize that? 
 I'm gonna find out what kind of dark ass sh1t's goin' on here. 
 We do have a dead friend. Remember that? 
 So you in or out? 
 Hey, asshole. 
 Remember me? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Why don't you take a swing at me? 
 I'd love to sue you for something. 
 You're lucky I didn't shoot you and your f*ckin' daughter. 
 Hey, watch your goddamn mouth about my daughter. 
 Who put you up to that sh1t? 
 Take a walk. 
 You may be a f*ckin' tough guy, but I'm a crazy guy. 
 The difference is crazy guys don't give up. 
 Is that right? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 So keep that in mind. 
 I'll be waiting. 
 I don't give up. 
 [water running] 
 Esperanza? 
 Esperanza? 
 What the hell? 
 How'd you get in here? 
 I told her I had permission. Don't be mad at her. 
 You look like sh1t. What's goin' on? 
 I went to a party, um, in Vegas. 
 Private jet. 
 I just got back. 
 I did too much... too much sh1t. 
 [groans] 
 Sit down, sit down. 
 I don't feel good. 
 Yeah, I guess not. 
 [sighs] Goddamnit. 
 Brittany, get up. Come on, let's get up. 
 Brittany. 
 Get off me. 
 Don't be goin' to sleep, okay? 
 I'm not sleeping. 
 Well, get up. Here, we're gonna walk around a little bit. 
 Billy, get off of me. 
 Come here, sweetie. 
 Get up. Goddamnit, get up. 
 Get off. Stop yelling at me. 
 [sighs] 
 Just walk around a minute, okay? 
 Okay, okay. 
 Okay. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Are you mad at me? 
 No, I'm not mad at you, sweetie, I'm tryin' to help you, this... 
 Please don't be mad at me. 
 Just eat it all. It'll help you. 
 [sighs] 
 [belching] 
 Uh... 
 Well, we almost got married. 
 [chuckling] 
 You what? 
 You got married? 
 Forget it. 
 Oh, sh1t. Where's my purse? 
 It's at the motel. 
 Oh, God, I have, like, $10,000 in there. 
 Got it right here. 
 You have the rest of my stuff? 
 Your stuff? 
 The... 
 With the rest of my stuff? 
 What, your lipstick? 
 Yeah, I know what you're talkin' about. 
 There's not very much of that left. 
 That's why you're in this shape. Remember? 
 Like you're so perfect. 
 You have a drink at this bar three times a day. 
 Well, how many times have you had to f*ckin', you know, walk me over here to eat a loaf of bread? 
 I mean, I remember that. 
 I can take care of myself. 
 I'm just trying to make it work. 
 All right, like everybody does. All right? 
 Yeah, look, I can maybe get some money, you know, start someplace fresh, maybe. 
 Why do you care anyway? 
 I'm doing my job, right? 
 Yeah, you're doin' your job. 
 I'm not worried about your work, your work's fine. 
 It's your personal life I'm worried about, 'cause I actually do care, just so you know. 
 I don't have a personal life, Billy. 
 I can't afford one.

 Callie : Jason Larsen individually and as successor and heir of Ryan Larsen versus Borns Technology complaint for damage... 
 Okay, we can make this go away for low six figures, but you won't do it. 
 Do you and I have an issue? 
 I'm not aware of one. 
 Then what is it going to take for you to do your job, and do what I say about this case? 
 [clicker clicking] 
 Don't click at me! 
 Continue, please. 
 Jason Larsen, a minor, herein alleges the wrongful death of the decedent, Ryan Larsen, his father, as previously alleged... 
 [clicker clicking] 
 Blah, blah. After that, it's basically the same complaint. 
 Old wine in a new bottle. 
 The guy just keeps coming. 
 You gotta admire his balls. 
 Maybe you can do that. 
 After hours. 
 Enough of this bullshit. 
 Where we are is... and correct me if I'm wrong... 
 We do not have to settle, because the statute of limitations has expired. 
 McBride is barred from re-filing this at court. 
 Correct? 
 [clicker clicking] 
 [sighs] Tell him. 
 Statute of limitations wouldn't apply to a minor. 
 f*ck! 
 ♪♪ 
 Behind you. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Mr. McBride. 
 You said I could beat the sh1t out of you here without breaking decorum. 
 This seems like an orderly establishment. 
 Sometimes. 
 You complained to the bishop about me. 
 You said I was preaching against the virgin birth, that I called for a crusade against Islam. 
 Was that supposed to be funny? 
 No. 
 Got your attention, though. 
 You know, that wasn't cool of you to kick us out of the funeral like that. 
 I have a pretty good idea as to what you're about. 
 [chuckles] Is that right? 
 Well, I'm a far cry from you, that's for sure. 
 You're not just a priest. You're one of the strict kind. 
 At least that's what Rachel said. 
 She said her brother went to your church because you're as religious as it comes. 
 Did he come to you to confess his sins? 
 That would be none of your business. 
 No priest would give a Catholic burial to someone who'd taken his own life. 
 And the word is that you've turned down parishioners before. 
 That you've denied funeral rites to people who have committed suicide. 
 But you buried Ryan Larsen. 
 You gave him the whole big show. 
 Would a good priest do that? 
 A good priest would never break the confessional seal. 
 So he did come to you to confess. 
 Have a good evening. 
 Listen, Father, I don't mean to be an asshole, but it's part of my business. 
 I'll sue you and the Catholic Church tomorrow. 
 On what grounds? 
 On the grounds that I'm an asshole. 
 And I'll depose your bishop, too. 
 As a matter of fact, I'll track his girlfriend down, and f*ck her if I have to. 
 And I saw her picture on Facebook, it's not good. 
 Please don't make me f*ck the bishop's girlfriend. 
 You are a despicable human being. 
 [chuckles] Oh, given that, don't make me stoop to what I'm capable of. 
 None of this has to happen if you just give me an honest and humble opinion. Is that too much to ask? 
 Can we not rely on our priests to be honest anymore? 
 You are what's wrong with the world. 
 You are greed and cynicism, and the mocking of all that is good and just. 
 I pity you. 
 Man : What?! California's bullshit. 
 The only good thing about California is that sh1t. 
 I'll put it to you this way. 
 I always knew I was comin' here, and you know why? 
 Because you see that sh1t right there? 
 Yeah, I get that. 
 That's the last f*ckin' frontier, dude.

 That's good. That's good. 
 If a cat... if a cat don't know ya, you throw a sinker on the first pitch, f*ckin' thing's comin' right down the f*ckin' gut. 
 Yep. 
 It'll dip, but you throw it for a strike, see. 
 You got the m*therf*cker, okay? 
 You know what Bob Gibson said? 
 Bob Gibson, the greatest f*ckin' pitcher in history, you know what he said? 
 He said, "You know what my most important pitch is?" 
 "Strike one." 
 [laughing] 
 Strike one. 
 [laughing] 
 Right? 
 Anyway, that's what I do, I hide the ball pretty well. 
 I look over at this m*therf*cker again, I come up... 
 Yep. 
 Right? 
 Yep. 
 Hell, yeah! 
 f*ck, yes! 
 Did you see that catch, fucker? 
 Hell, yeah, man. 
 You saw that, didn't ya? 
 Goddamn right. 
 Goddamn right.

 I don't know if your... if your daddy, uh, told you about it, but we have a very big court day tomorrow, in which I have to talk. [chuckles] 
 Uh, so, I... I'm not... Two seconds.

 No, he... 
 He did, he mentioned you. 
 Oh, great. 
 He said you were great. 
 Actually, he said you were a natural. 
 And that you were gonna kill it tomorrow. 
 Kill it in a bad... Kill it in a bad way or kill it in a good way? 
 No, he just said kill it. 
 Right. 
 Which is a good thing. 
 Swear to God. 
 I'm gonna... I'm gonna be great. 
 Tomorrow. 
 It was a pleasure to meet you. 
 You, too. 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Take care. 
 You take care. 
 You take care twice, because you made my night. 
 ♪♪ 
 You know what? 
 I'm really proud of you. 
 Standing up for what you believe in. 
 No matter what. 
 Dad didn't kill himself. 
 I wish he hadn't. 
 But he did. 
 And I would not lie to you about that. 
 He was so sad for so long, and... just hated what he did. 
 Hated what he was. 
 And he didn't want to get help. 
 If I ask you to drop this case, would you? 
 Would you, for me? 
 No. 
 It's repulsive, your honor, for Mr. McBride to be saddling up a child for the purpose of end-running standing, it's... 
 Oh, bullshit, the child came to us. 
 And that makes it okay? 
 Uh, no, but it makes it legal because the child has standing to sue, and that's the law. I didn't make that up. 
 The California Supreme Court has expressly held that parental choice is the foundation of family law, and that parents have the right to protect their children from the unscrupulous behavior of predatory attorneys. 
 Oh, objection. Come on. 
 I mean, it ain't ironclad, and there are plenty of exceptions. 
 Yes, if the child is being abused or neglected, and this is not that. 
 No, this involves a conflict of interest between a mother and her child. 
 The mother has made a settlement and doesn't want to sue, and the child wants to find out the truth about what happened to his father. 
 Now, the court has said that in a case like this, a guardian ad litem lawyer has to be appointed to represent the best interest of the child, and again, not making this up. 
 Ms. Papalian, have you ever served as a guardian ad litem before? 
 Papagian. Uh, no, your honor, but code section 3-7-2 is pretty clear that if appointed, I would hire Mr. McBride to pursue the case which he's already started. 
 Your honor, if I may. 
 Ms. Papagian is a recent graduate of LaVerne Law School evening track, and a friend of the late Rachel Kennedy, and I believe she introduced the initial case to Mr. McBride. 
 The conflict of interest is astonishing. 
 Your honor, if she says my name, may I respond, please? 
 No. 
 Okay. I see. 
 Young man, please rise. 
 You met Ms. Papagian... [clears throat] 
 And it is your wish that she be appointed as your guardian? 
 Yes, your honor. 
 What grade are you in? 
 Ninth. 
 Ninth. 
 You a good student? Get good report cards? 
 Yeah. Straight A's. 
 My dad was an engineer, and I do really well in math. 
 Who do you want for president? 
 Well, who do you want for president? 
 'Cause I think they all suck. 
 Ms. Papagian is appointed guardian. 
 A guardian may choose the lawyer she believes has the best interest of the child in mind, therefore, Mr. McBride is appointed to handle Jason's lawsuit. 
 And we are adjourned. 
 I'll see counsel in chambers, please. 
 I'm assuming we are all here. 
 First of all, well done, Mr. McBride. 
 Thank you, your honor. 
 You're nothing if not dogged. 
 I'm hereby designating this matter as complex. 
 So, we will be dispensing with conventional rules of discovery. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The complex case program. 
 It's been around since 1996. 
 When a case is considered too complicated for a lay jury to understand, it is deferred to a complex litigation manager, which I happen to be. 
 Oh. 
 The matter is expedited, and you won't have to wait the five plus years to see this through. 
 Well, the fact that they're not objecting kind of gives me pause. 
 Streamlined. It doesn't appeal to you? 
 Oh, yeah, streamline appeals to me. 
 Uh, ramrodded, not so much. 
 Give me your bottom line figure. 
 What will it take to make it go away? 
 And, look, don't be stupid. 
 Okay. $5 million. 
 Miss Senate. I'll chip that to 1.2. What say you? 
 We're not settling. Borns Tech neither caused Mr. Larsen's death, nor lied about it so... 
 That is really terrific news. 
 If this thing goes the trial route, you're looking at defense costs in excess of $3 million, why not be done today for half the price? 
 We offer nothing. 
 Nothing. Really? 
 How do you feel about that, Mr. Letts? 
 Listen, I'd imagine you enjoy being general counsel at Borns Tech. 
 Mm-hm. 
 You make, what, with stock options, $2 million? 
 You might consider doing your job should you be inclined to keep it. 
 He has a dead man and his son. 
 300,000. 
 Your honor, can I have a moment to speak to my client, please? 
 Payable today. Waivers on all claims. 
 Confidentiality agreement with penalties. 
 Leonard. 
 Nah. 
 Wait, no, no. 
 No, don't talk. 
 Okay, I'll up it to 500. 
 Five's acceptable. I can do five. 
 So you can make that decision? 
 You can go up that high without running it past anybody or anything? 
 Yes. 
 Wow. 
 Well, that's a whole different kettle of fish there. 
 f*ck no. 
 Your honor, I'm sorry, can I have a moment with my colleague? 
 Please. 
 Thank you. Thank you so much. 
 [whispering] Um, take the motherfucking deal. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 So you're working freelance now? 
 Because Wendell Corey and Cooperman made it very clear that we're not settling. 
 I'm the f*cking general counsel. 
 The offer's 500,000. 
 And the offer is rejected. 
 I am offering both sides the opportunity to blink. 
 Okay. 
 Here's how it's gonna go from here. 
 We'll reconvene tomorrow. 
 Yet again. 
 You make me an offer of proof that rises considerably above this piece of sh1t complaint or I dismiss your cause of action altogether. 
 Now, I suppose you think I can't do that. 
 Jesus, you blew off half a million dollars. 
 A half a million dollars... 
 I mean, do you know how f*cked up that is? 
 That's not sh1t to these guys. Do you understand that? 
 They're flippin' us a nickel. 
 God. 
 There's a hell of a lot more to it than a half million dollars. 
 They're hiding something big here. 
 There's no f*cking question about it. 
 Don't you want to do this for Rachel and the kid? 
 You want to find out the truth? 
 Oh, like you're so f*cking principled.

 The ones that'll come up if I tell the police that Gabriel's blowing seals up again. 
 Man. I ain't sayin' sh1t 'cause I don't know sh1t. 
 All I know is what I saw. 
 [explosions] 
 sh1t. He took that with his phone? 
 Yeah, from a distance. 
 Are they terrorists? 
 I read once they clamped down on the Somali pirates, a lot of them ended up here as fishermen. 
 Marva, could you give us a minute, please? 
 Certainly. 
 The Marquez boys told me that this rained down on them after the explosion, but, uh, it's not the same kind of plastic you'd get from a boat. 
 Where's it from? 
 I don't know. We're gonna have to hire an explosives expert. 
 Who pays for that? 
 How's that list of ex Borns Tech employees going? 
 Here is a list of former Borns Tech engineers, who are registered for the job expo. 
 What job expo is that? 
 Oh, the one I advertised online. 
 It's totally free. You just say that you're a start up sub contractor interested in hiring somebody who has a background in aerospace or military projects, preferably somebody with experience at Borns Tech, and they send you a list of names. 
 Oh, I highlighted the ones there that left under questionable circumstances. 
 You know how grumpy former employees tend to be Chatty Cathys. 
 And you came up with this. 
 I did. 
 That's pretty impressive. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. So, Brittany, get an IT guy to blow these images up, and then all three of you go through this list, and find somebody that knows what this sh1t is. 
 You don't think the video would be enough? 
 With this judge? No, I don't. 
 Letts : Look, I did what any good lawyer would do. 
 We can afford to settle this. 
 No, Leonard, we cannot. 
 You know what the biggest lie in American history is? 
 That if Richard Nixon had just admitted what he did, he wouldn't have had to resign. 
 That's bullshit. 
 If he'd told the truth about Watergate, they'd have just kept on digging. 
 He'd have gone to prison or worse. 
 What are you not telling me, Wendell? 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 Now, I took this job on the promise that there were no issues here. 
 I moved my family here. Now you're telling me there are issues. 
 Leonard, there are always issues. 
 And I've been trying to protect you from them, but you won't let me. 
 And there's not enough money in the world to settle this case. 
 So just make sure it goes the hell away. 
 Hey. Case over? 
 No. 
 Judge designated it complex. 
 [chuckles] Billy needs to make a compelling offer of proof by tomorrow, which should be difficult. 
 It'll probably go away. 
 Although, clearly, your ex husband is not about to. 
 I tried to tell you that. 
 Listen, if this case survives tomorrow, and it shouldn't, but if it does, my marching orders are not gonna be to merely argue the case. 
 They are going to be to destroy the man bringing it. 
 And I... 
 I don't want to pretend to you that it's not gonna get ugly. 
 I hear ya, but has it not gotten ugly already? 
 The last plaintiff is dead. 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 That was an accident. 
 I know. I checked with the LAPD, they said they had a couple of tips, but no real leads. 
 You checked? 
 I was curious. 
 Billy's making you crazy again. 
 Come on. 
 This is what happens. 
 Whenever you spend any length of time with him, you catch his crazy. 
 It's true. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Why do you think that you were selected for this case? 
 You'd have to ask Cooperman. 
 No, I'm asking you. 
 Donald clearly thinks you match up well against Billy. 
 Do you two match up well? 
 What? 
 Well, I didn't f*ck him, if that's what you mean. 
 No, that's not... What? 
 Jesus Christ. 
 You know, after all these years, after everything he put you through, you are still obsessed with him. 
 Hey... 
 It's just sad. 
 I did not mean to offend you. 
 [sighs] 
 Callie... 
 You know, not everyone who meets him wants to f*ck him. 
 That's your problem, Michelle. 
 And I tell you this as your friend. 
 Get over it. 
 We're... we're seeking out Borns Tech personnel, because they pre-qualify for, uh... for security clearances. 
 Yes, we manufacture components for small private weapons companies. 
 Uh, lasers. Directional components. 
 It is for a management position. 
 It's for a senior management mid level. 
 Well, I know it's a big company, but, uh, the older white engineers tend to stick together in cliques, right? 
 We're looking for people specialized in flight based classified patents. 
 Yes, health insurance is included. 
 Yep, we have dental. 
 You want to bring your pet, you can bring your pet. 
 Oh, I love a missile man. [chuckles] 
 ♪♪[rock] 
 Hey, guess what. 
 What's up? What? 
 I think we found our guy. 
 Really? 
 Yep. 
 He lives out in Reseda, and he sounds really good on the phone. 
 Well, let's go. 
 Now? 
 Of course now. You heard the judge. 
 If we don't have something tomorrow, we're f*cked, so let's go. Come on. 
 Man. 
 I inherited the place from my folks, so there's no mortgage, but there's upkeep, so there's cost. Kind of a money pit. 
 Did you want ice? I don't have any. 
 No, I'm good. 
 Thank you. 
 So, I'm getting that this isn't really about a job interview. 
 I'm an intuitive person. 
 You're not really here to hire me, are you? 
 Well... 
 No. 
 Uh, we're liars by trade, we practice law. 
 This about Borns Tech? 
 Billy : Yes, sir. 
 Patty : Which... which I said over the phone. 
 Remember, I wanted to talk to you about your employment? 
 Yes, for the purposes of hiring me. 
 Yeah, and also to identify some plastic materials. 
 Why'd you leave there? 
 Partly downsizing. 
 Military cuts, fewer weapons development, and then I had some issues with management. 
 What kind of issues? 
 Psychiatric, caused by them. 
 I am not a crazy person. That is a stressful place. 
 They induce things. 
 Right. 
 I hear ya. 
 Why don't you just show me this plastic. 
 Yeah. 
 I saw your kiddie pool out front there. 
 Do you got some children around here? 
 No. Mine from when I was a kid. 
 Now I just use it to catch rain water. 
 You know, there's a drought. 
 Right. 
 I know what this is. 
 What is it? 
 I can't tell you. 
 Patty : Why not? 
 This is part of a classified project. 
 You shouldn't have it. 
 It is a crime for you to have this. 
 Well, we didn't steal it or anything, we found it in the ocean. 
 Well, if that's the case, somebody at Borns Tech is in a lot of trouble. 
 You see, that plastic's part of a program to test something that isn't supposed to be near anyplace where there are people or really any living thing. 
 Okay? 
 I know. I worked on that project. 
 What project? 
 I can't tell you that. 
 Right, you keep saying that. 
 You know, Ned, we can pay you as an expert witness, and maybe help you defray some of these upkeep costs you were talking about. 
 How much? 
 We'll talk about that later. 
 Why don't you just tell us exactly what this stuff is. 
 It's casing. 
 For ignition housing. 
 Ignition housing. 
 Bombs. 
 Very big bombs. 
 Rocket fueled, laser guided badass bombs. 
 That sh1t should never have been near any fishing boat. 
 Can I get you to say that in affidavit form? 
 Absolutely not. This is a very big company. 
 They can hurt people. 
 We have legal mechanisms to conceal your identity. 
 If you're worried about your personal safety, don't worry about that. 
 [groans] 
 [stammering] 
 Could you stop that, please? 
 I'm... I'm sorry, what did... what did I do? 
 You know what you're doing. I want you to stop. 
 What did she do? 
 She's putting thoughts into my head. 
 She's sending them through her eyes. 
 And I want you to stop. 
 Stop it, Patty, okay? 
 She won't do it again, Ned, don't worry. 
 So, what's the plan? 
 Is there a plan? What are we going to do? 
 'Cause if the case goes on... 
 Judge Keller is sympathetic to us. 
 He will close them down for good. 
 Trust me. 
 Is it so difficult to trust me, Leonard? 
 [clicker clicking] 
 [sighs] Whether or not I trust you, letting Billy McBride rattle cages is... is like giving a lunatic a hammer, and letting him run through Tiffany's. 
 That man is dangerous. 
 But I'm more so. 
 [clicker clicking] 
 You asleep? 
 Not even close. 
 Nervous? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm nervous. 
 Hey. 
 It's like riding a bike. 
 You walk into that judge's chamber, you become Billy McBride again. 
 You wait and see. 
 How about I relax you? 
 No. 
 You sure? 
 One of these days. 
 [chuckles] 
 Come here. 
 [sighs] 
 [seagulls squawking] 
 [traffic noise] 
 Jeez. Join the crowd, honey. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm going to court, sweetie. 
 It's no place you want to be. 
 No place you want to be. I'll see you later. Okay? 
 What's wrong, Billy? 
 You look nervous. 
 Oh, I'm not nervous, I'm just tired. 
 I was up all night preparing to whip your ass. 
 [door opens] 
 Okay, Mr. McBride. This is your show. 
 What have you got? 
 No idle chitchat first? 
 You have 20 minutes, sir. 
 Okay. I'll try to do it in about five. 
 This is the affidavit of Ryan Larsen's son, declaring his opinion that this was no suicide. 
 This is my personal affidavit of conversations I had with eyewitnesses who say that this explosion was a helluva lot bigger, and a helluva lot worse than what would happen if you dropped a match into a fuel tank of a boat. 
 Now, this one right here contains all of the anecdotal physical and testimonial evidence introduced or alleged by anyone who supports the notion that Ryan Larsen was suicidal. 
 And as you can see, it's blank. 
 Because there ain't nobody. 
 This is the video footage of the actual explosion. 
 [explosions] 
 Match in a fuel tank. 
 This is the declaration of one Alejandro Marquez authenticating that he captured this video footage, and that it's a fair and accurate representation of what happened the night that Ryan Larsen was killed. 
 These are remnants of the debris that rained down on the Marquez boat immediately following the explosion. 
 They can be confirmed in his declaration there. 
 And this is the affidavit of John Doe, an ex-employee of Borns Tech. 
 He has conducted a preliminary analysis of this debris here, and he's determined that it's plastic shell casing material, material that's used in the weaponry of Borns Tech. 
 More specifically, ignition housing used only on weapons that are inherently dangerous. 
 And not allowed outside a war zone. 
 Or a weapons testing facility. 
 I think if you examine this evidence, you could safely make a finding. 
 I rest my case. 
 This would be a good time for one of you to talk. 
 Uh, first of all, all any of this, uh, shows is that a boat blew up. 
 None of it unearths any new evidence of wrongdoing or confirms it. 
 Nothing new was unearthed. 
 Is... Is that what you mean to tell me, Miss Senate? 
 This is smoke and mirrors, your honor. 
 I'd also ask you to take judicial note of Mr. McBride's reputation for truthfulness. 
 Well. 
 Well, well, well, folks. 
 We have ourselves a lawsuit. 
 ♪♪ 
 [elevator dings] 
 I got a question. 
 What the f*ck happened on the boat?
