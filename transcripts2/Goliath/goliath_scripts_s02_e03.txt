 (PIANO PLAYING ON VIDEO) 
  YOUNG WOMAN: Where'd you film this? 
  Union Station, Saturday. 
  Who is she? 
  I don't know. 
  They just had a sign on the piano that said anybody can play. 
  She sat down. 
  She started playing. 
  She's so talented. 
  Wish I had the money to travel. 
  Play music anywhere. 
  I want to go to Paris. 
  Someday I'll have the money to take you to Paris.

  (TIRES SQUEALING) 
  (WOMAN SCREAMING) 
  Stay here. 
  (WOMAN SCREAMING) 
  (ECHOING): No! 
  Pedro! 
  Martin! 
  Talk to me, mijo. 
  Hey. 
  It's Papa, huh? 
  It's Papa. 
  I'm here. 
  (SOBBING): No. 
  No No. 
  (ECHOING): Somebody help! 
  (SOBBING) 
  Goddamn it. 
  Pathetic. 
  f*cking asshole. 
  I could've cut you six ways from Sunday with that noisy machine going. 
  They wouldn't even hear you scream. 
  - (MACHINE BEEPS OFF) 
  - (GROANS) 
  What time is it? 
  It's late. 
  It's late. 
  I got a name for your little brown guy. 
  Tito Garcia. 
  That is everything you need to find him. 
  All right. 
  I owe you one, man. 
  No, you don't. 
  I'll be in hock up to my ears for years with you. 
  Well, let me know when we're even, okay? 
  Yeah. 
  - You got Wallace on the bench. 
  - Yeah. 
  And Hakeem Rashad on my right. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  '27 Yankees. 
  Yeah, well, I like to think that we're the Gashouse Gang, - so f*ck the Yankees. 
  - f*ck the Yankees, yeah. 
  You know, uh you may have to tell Wallace where you got that. 
  You sure? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Got to run. 
  Don't want to lose my parking spot. 
  There's street cleaning, I don't want Darryl to grab it. 
  I hear you. 
  And certainly, you ought to do something about this lock. 
  I mean, a goddamn monkey with a credit card could get past it. 
  - It did. 
  - Yeah. 
  Be careful, Billy. 
  This Tito Garcia's a slippery little sh1t and I don't I don't like him. 
  Appreciate it, JT. 
  - See you. 
  - Yeah. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  (SIGHS) 
  JT: (SCOFFS) 
  f*ck. 
  This is the real shooter, Tito Garcia. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  So, what, this just fell out of the sky or something? 
  I have a source. 
  Your Honor, this is some bullshit, okay? 
  And he even knows this is bullshit. 
  I have it on very good authority that this is the shooter. 
  I'd like his trial testimony taken now before the trial even starts. 
  Okay, and then you're gonna do what? 
  Accuse him of murdering PeÃ±a and Friedman? 
  BILLY: That's exactly what I'm gonna do. 
  Look, Your Honor, a conditional exam is highly unusual. 
  He's just creating a distraction. 
  Why don't you just subpoena him for the trial, Mr. 
  McBride? 
  - Thank you. 
  - Your Honor, we believe that he's a flight risk. 
  He's an illegal immigrant and we don't want to wait for him to end up in Mexico. 
  HAKEEM: Okay, so where is the proof, any proof whatsoever, that Garcia is connected to the crime? 
  Where's the proof? 
  That's something I can't reveal in open court. 
  We do know that this is not the kind of guy who respects a subpoena. 
  So I want to get his testimony on the record so as I don't lose another witness. 
  I'm sorry, Your Honor, I-I really hate to bog you down with meaningless things such as proof. 
  But we still have no proof and this is still a court of law, is it not? 
  I know this is a court of law, Mr. 
  Rashad. 
  Mr. 
  McBride, we do need to know that your information is credible. 
  I can tell you who, but if I tell you anything more, then I would have to do it with, uh, an emptier room. 
  WALLACE: (SIGHS) 
  Okay, fine. 
  Well, who's your source? 
  - James T. 
  Reginald. 
  - James James T. 
  Reginald. 
  Wow, that's He had a nervous breakdown. 
  The guy had a breakdown. 
  - He's not reliable whatsoever. 
  - Yeah, so you're a f*cking - psychiatrist now or something? 
  - James T. 
  , that's all you got? 
  Clear the room. 
  I need to speak to Mr. 
  McBride ex parte. 
  Ex parte? 
  You - Really? 
  - WALLACE: I don't want him to have to reveal any of his attorney work product about his source. 
  Yeah. 
  - BILLY: Patty. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, it's kind of just Yes. 
  Yep. 
  Yep. 
  Open or closed? 
  - WALLACE: Close the door, please. 
  - Sure. 
  How is he? 
  He's better. 
  WALLACE: Hmm. 
  I haven't seen him since that night, you know. 
  Yeah. 
  I can tell you where to find him. 
  I know where to find him. 
  Poor f*cking guy. 
  God, he was he was a brilliant lawyer. 
  Yeah, he was. 
  But, man, the system just broke him. 
  Okay. 
  Let me just think for a minute. 
  (PEN CLICKING LOUDLY) 
  You want to cool it with the pen, Rain Man? 
  I know JT and Billy go way back, but JT's a fricking lunatic. 
  Yes, and I'm very comfortable with that. 
  Did Billy take my plea deal to your client? 
  Lawyers are required to do so. 
  You didn't answer the question. 
  Mmm. 
  I think I did. 
  What do you think? 
  She's not here to think, she's here to listen. 
  (LAUGHING): Oh, man. 
  Are you okay with that? 
  Mr. 
  Rashad, I've decided to grant Mr. 
  McBride's request. 
  - (SIGHS) 
  Ex parte, Your Honor? 
  - WALLACE: We've discussed it. 
  You've made your points; I've listened. 
  And now I've made my decision. 
  Well played. 
  BILLY: Thank you. 
  What did you say in there? 
  The judge and JT have history. 
  So we used it. 
  I went here. 
  Why would you go low - when I put my hand up to go high? 
  - Because you do it weird, and I always end up hitting you with my fingertips. 
  - No, that's not how it works. 
  - And it's stupid, that's why. 
  And I look like an idiot. 
  ELENA: Pay special attention to Ms. 
  Vogel. 
  She's head of the school board and she's not a big fan. 
  But I thought today was the MTA meeting. 
  That's tomorrow. 
  - MARISOL: Oh, sh1t. 
  - (DOOR CLOSES) 
  ELENA: Are you okay? 
  Yeah, just give me one second. 
  I called you ten times. 
  - It was actually 13. 
  - I've never called anybody - ten times before. 
  - 13. 
  Whatever. 
  Can we have a conversation, please? 
  No. 
  You're gonna have to make an appointment to see me. 
  Talk to Elena. 
  Elena. 
  (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) 
  - MARISOL: Hi! 
  - Hello, my friend. 
  Looks like it's just you and me. 
  Yeah, I'm so excited. 
  What days are you free? 
  WYATT: I'm free right now. 
  ELENA: Right now does not work. 
  Could you maybe do Thursday? 
  No, thanks. 
  Hakeem's not doing us any favors - offering this plea deal, you know. 
  - Really. 
  Look, I don't want to plea-out either, but I also don't want to keep tap-dancing like an asshole, pretending it's not on the table. 
  Excuse me. 
  We need to see a Detective Roman, Keith Roman. 
  OFFICER: Yes, sir. 
  Let me, uh, just get him on the line. 
  - Hey. 
  - Roman! 
  Oh, hey, man. 
  - Hey, bud. 
  - Uh, I was just on my way out. 
  Well, listen. 
  We got a guy we need you to find and bring him in; we got to depose him right away. 
  Sorry, man, I don't have time. 
  You'll, uh, have to fill out the paperwork, okay? 
  - No. 
  We got to get this done today. 
  - Well, I'm late for a family obligation, so you'll have to fill out the paperwork like every other f*cking attorney. 
  All right? 
  Have a good day. 
  Thanks, Roman. 
  - What a dick. 
  - Yeah, he's an asshole. 
  Look, I think I'm gonna go over to Garcia's last known address. 
  - You got that, uh - Yeah. 
  - Where is it? 
  - Borrow your pen? 
  - Yep. 
  There. 
  - All right. 
  954 How's the food? 
  JULIO: It's bad. 
  All I want is a cheeseburger. 
  I wish I could bring you one. 
  I'm-I'm kind of scared having - that thing you - Don't. 
  - What? 
  - Shh. 
  They record these conversations here. 
  My parents might find it. 
  What should I do? 
  Don't do anything, okay? 
  (SIGHS) 
  Okay. 
  Don't-don't be scared. 
  Okay. 
  I love you. 
  I love you, too.

  - Sorry, who is? 
  - Uh, sorry. 
  I'll be right back. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Thank you. 
  (ROMAN SIGHS) 
  You know this is totally inappropriate, right? 
  Sorry, but you ran away before we could tell you - that we found the shooter. 
  - That's funny, 'cause we have the shooter sitting in jail right now. 
  Right, but the court just ordered this guy to testify. 
  Do you know him? 
  Do you know where I could find him? 
  You're crazy, you know that? 
  What do you mean? 
  What I'm here with my family right now, and you come here with this horseshit. 
  Yeah, well, our client is (GASPS) 
  I swear to God, if you come at me again Let go of me. 
  - I'm a cop. 
  - Let go of me. 
  Think I don't know where you live? 
  - Let go of my arm. 
  - Think I can't do things to you? 
  Jesus Christ. 
  Jesus, man, what just happened? 
  f*ck. 
  Who'd you tell about Tito Garcia, huh? 
  What? 
  I didn't tell anyone. 
  Then how the f*ck did she get his name? 
  Wh-Who the f*ck is she? 
  She works with Billy McBride. 
  I am not going down over this sh1t, man.

  Because - that's a big ask. 
  - Yeah, I know it is. 
  He may be connected to a big cartel. 
  You guys would be pretty interested in that, wouldn't you? 
  Yeah. 
  All right. 
  Let me see what I can do.

  Oh. 
  I think there's something bigger behind it. 
  I mean, not that it's not big already. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - There's a lot more to it than you meets the eye, I guess you'd say. 
  And, uh, there's something creeping me out about it. 
  I don't know what it is yet, but something's creeping me out. 
  Do you know Tom Wyatt? 
  Yeah, I know who he is. 
  I don't know him, but the real estate guy, right? 
  Yeah.

  That is a restraining order, for your information. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  Okay. 
  - It states that you will stay 100 feet away from me - at all times. 
  - It does? 
  Yeah, is that right? 
  - That's right. 
  - Okay. 
  Well, see, it's normally 50 to 100 yards. 
  But here's the thing this is not a restraining order, honey. 
  - Oh, no, it is. 
  - It's written in f*ckin' pencil on a notebook page. 
  - You made this up, okay? 
  - It's real. 
  - You understand? 
  - It's here. 
  It's real. 
  - I know you're not well, - Yeah, it's here, but - and you don't understand things. 
  - And you don't just bring it over yourself with some f*ckin' guy. 
  The authorities have to serve it. 
  So why don't you and meathead get away - from my f*ckin' door, okay? 
  - Oh, my God.

  - No, I didn't jerk off into anything. 
  - Come with me, and Misty will take care of you, and will shield you - and will bring you someplace safe. 
  - Okay, you know what? 
  You know what? 
  Consider me served! 
  All right? 
  This is a restraining order. 
  I accept it! 
  Okay.

  How's that? 
  Well, I live in Santa Monica. 
  Come on, Misty. 
  I (CLEARS THROAT SOFTY) 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Sorry about that, honey. 
  It's just she's a f*cking nutjob. 
  That was embarrassing. 
  Like I said, I'm sorry about that. 
  Sometimes when I drink too much, I, um well, I kind of black out. 
  Not exactly black out, but I I lose sense the sense of time and place and people and lunatics. 
  And this one here, she was a real tilt-a-whirl, she's Are you kidding me?

  I go right to them every time. 
  Oh, you'd be surprised. 
  Let's have a competition. 
  - I guarantee you I'll win. 
  - Okay.

  I'm I'm so sorry. 
  That was weird.

  Pleasure to meet you. 
  Good to see you. 
  - Good to see you. 
  - Good to see you. 
  Okay. 
  What are you talking about? 
  Marisol Silva? 
  Are you freaking kidding me? 
  I told you before, we're friends. 
  And we've got work together. 
  I told you. 
  (SIGHS) 
  You know, you should invite her over for dinner. 
  I'll cook. 
  Okay. 
  Nothing wrong with that, I guess. 
  Oh, my God, Dad. 
  - (LAUGHS SOFTLY) 
  - (SIGHS HEAVILY) 
  You know what? 
  I am so happy that you I am so happy that you like somebody like her. 
  I mean, she's so cool and she's smart, and we're gonna be best friends. 
  - You need to calm down. 
  - I knew that you were acting differently, I just couldn't put my finger on it. 
  I haven't been acting differently. 
  And this explains so much. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Just try not to scare her off, all right? 
  What am I, some kind of monster? 
  I scare people off? 
  I didn't say you were a monster, but you know. 
  You know how you can be. 
  Marisol Silva. 
  (LOUD EXHALE) 
  WYATT: You know, we should put one of your Carl's Jr. 
  s in there. 
  At least I know you'd show up for work every day. 
  - It'd be great. 
  - I don't eat that every day. 
  - LOOMIS: Once a week, tops. 
  - Oh, three times this week, that I know of, minimum. 
  Hey. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Does the name Tito Garcia mean anything to you? 
  Uh, should it? 
  What Uh, what-what about Tito? 
  Well, Danny, you might be interested to know Billy McBride has the FBI bringing him back from Mexico. 
  What the f*ck? 
  Wha-What is this, Danny? 
  - I'll take care of it. 
  - Who the f*ck is Tito? 
  What - He's, uh, Roman's guy. 
  - Danny, this is the sh1t that - I don't want to know about. 
  - I know, I know. 
  No, you say you know, but then I keep finding out about this sh1t - 'cause it keeps coming up. 
  - Okay, we can't afford any more of your f*cking mistakes, so - we're gonna do this my way. 
  - Marisol Tom without me as mayor, all of this is f*cked, - and so are you. 
  - Hey, you got to win first. 
  I will win but I'm also gonna keep my eye on Billy McBride. 
  Yeah, is that what you call it, keeping an eye on him? 
  Yeah. 
  Whatever it takes to keep Billy McBride away from your business. 
  And I'm also gonna make sure Julio stays out of prison. 
  You know, I just don't trust that you can do both. 
  Well, you don't have a choice. 
  You need me as your f*cking mayor. 
  (CAR DOOR OPENS) 
  (CAR DOOR CLOSES) 
  WYATT: Now I get pulled into this f*ckin' clusterfuck? 
  - (STAMMERS) 
  - She's forcing my hand now I got to f*ckin' - f*ckin' - Okay, okay. 
  - You do Tito. 
  Tito first. 
  - I yes, I got it, I got it. 
  Then you find out all the people that work for McBride, - and you f*ckin' handle it this time. 
  - Geez. 
  I - (LINE RINGING) 
  - (WHISPERS): f*ck. 
  - (LINE CONNECTS) 
  - MAN: Yep? 
  Uh, we got a problem. 
  This one Gabriel might like. 
  Federales picked up a guy, uh, Tito Garcia, who needs to keep his mouth shut. 
  Tom thought Gabriel would enjoy shutting it for him. 
  So whatever you want to do. 
  Be creative. 
  - MAN: Okay. 
  - (SIGHS) 
  (LINE DISCONNECTS) 
  - (PHONE BEEPS) 
  - (WHISPERS) 
 : f*ck. 
  BILLY: Little tiny yard like this, all your guys looking for it, and you didn't find it the first time? 
  Where was the gun? 
  It was in the fence behind the trash cans. 
  Original search warrant didn't cover the common areas of the property. 
  Yeah, it's never stopped you before. 
  ROMAN: We go by the letter of the law, McBride. 
  This new search comes off of any anonymous tip. 
  Of course it was anonymous. 
  You want to cause trouble? 
  - Is that it? 
  Yeah? 
  - Yes. 
  - Keep talking, okay? 
  - Come on, Roman. 
  Come on, dude. 
  HAKEEM: Once we test the ballistics and the prints, it's gonna be a slam dunk for us. 
  Same model, same caliber as the murder weapon. 
  It's a good thing your client knows about my plea deal. 
  Yeah, we're not taking it. 
  (PHONE RINGING) 
  Hang on, guys. 
  Excuse me for a minute. 
  Hello. 
  Hey, we, uh we lost Tito. 
  BILLY: What? 
  How the hell did that happen? 
  JEFF: Ah, the federales had him, and then disappeared, I guess. 
  Ambushed or something. 
  Look, I'm sorry about the bad news, but we're gonna keep trying, okay? 
  BILLY: Well, update me, all right? 
  Thanks, Jeff. 
  What's wrong? 
  That was Jeff. 
  They lost Garcia. 
  sh1t. 
  Okay, here we go. 
  I want the Cobb salad, right? 
  Instead of iceberg, I want romaine. 
  Instead of blue cheese, I want Parmesan, okay? 
  - Does it come with bacon? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Absolutely no bacon. 
  - This ain't the Four Seasons. 
  They bring it how they bring it, all right? 
  I like it how I like it, and I want the vinaigrette instead of the whatever dressing, okay? 
  Thank you. 
  - Coffee. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  So you don't understand because you don't even like food. 
  - Yeah, I do. 
  - Anyway And I-I know that you don't want to talk about this, but the plea deal's gonna bite us in the ass. 
  I'm not letting the kid plea out. 
  You do understand that if we don't present it, we're gonna get disbarred, right? 
  This kid's been through hell and back, okay? 
  I'm not gonna look him in the eye and say, "I know you didn't do it, but go to jail for 11 years anyway. 
  " Well, we don't even know if he's innocent. 
  - I won't do it. 
  - Why? 
  I told you why. 
  (SIGHS) 
  All right, so do you know what it means to plea to voluntary manslaughter? 
  - No, not really. 
  - Okay. 
  So what it is is that you'd be agreeing to say that you killed Marcos and Hunter, but that you didn't plan it. 
  Right? 
  That it was in the heat of the moment. 
  Um, so with that deal, you're looking at 11 years. 
  Uh, with good behavior, you could be out in seven. 
  Is that clear? 
  So you you think I should take the deal? 
  Uh, well (UNDER BREATH): Do we want to take it? 
  - Um - (SLAPS HAND ON TABLE) 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, if you did it, I think it's the best-case scenario. 
  - Yes. 
  - But I didn't kill them. 
  Right, you didn't kill them. 
  - Okay. 
  Yeah. 
  - I didn't. 
  Okay, so you tell me why the cops just found the murder weapon at your house. 
  I don't know anything about that. 
  That's the truth. 
  Right. 
  And you had the gun in the video why? 
  That's not the gun from the video. 
  It can't be. 
  What are you talking about? 
  I lied to you about something else. 
  Okay. 
  Sorry. 
  I just thought you and Mr. 
  McBride were gonna get I don't care. 
  The gun I had, - the one that was in the video - Mm-hmm. 
  I didn't throw it in the ocean like I said. 
  I gave it to my girlfriend to hold onto. 
  Why wouldn't you just give it to us? 
  I-I don't understand that. 
  Because it was my brother's. 
  I don't know what he used it for, but I was just worried that it was gonna get me into even more trouble. 
  Where's Mr. 
  McBride? 
  Yeah, he couldn't make it. 
  BRITTANY: Can I just be honest with you guys? 
  Like, there is no silver lining for me. 
  Like, I-I wake up, and every day is so goddamn hard. 
  Man, I wish that I could go back in time and live my life over again. 
  Minus all the stupid f*cking choices I made. 
  But I can't, right? 
  I can just be here now. 
  Anyway Yeah, that's it. 
  Thanks. 
  (APPLAUSE) 
  MAN: Think I really needed to hear that tonight. 
  Thanks, Brittany. 
  Yeah.

  He delivered you some fresh flowers to show his appreciation.

  Pufnstuff Can't do a little 'cause he can't do enough - It's time for breakfast. 
  - Once upon a summertime Just a dream from yesterday A boy and his magic golden flute Heard a boat from off the bay "Come and play with me, Jimmy, come and play with me "And I will take you on a trip - (CEREAL POURING) 
  - Far across the sea. 
  " But the boat belonged to a kooky old witch Time for healing, no more peeling. 
  From her Vroom Broom in the sky She watched her plans materialize She waved her wand The beautiful boat was gone The skies grew dark, the sea grew rough And the boat sailed on and on And on and on and on and on But Pufnstuff was watching, too And knew exactly what to do He saw the witch's bold attack And as the boy was fighting back He called his rescue racer crew As often they'd rehearsed And off to save the boy they flew (SPOKEN): But who would get there first? 
  But now the boy had washed ashore Puf arrived to save the day Which made the witch so mad and sore She shook her fist and screamed away - (SCREAMING IN SONG)
