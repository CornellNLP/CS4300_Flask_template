 [classical] 
 Does this hurt? I'd never want to hurt you. 
 The first few years, I couldn't bear to be touched. 
 Talking was torture because of the burns. 
 But I adapted, learned to communicate with the tools at hand. 
 [clicker clicks] 
 Kept me distracted. 
 Kept me from scratching my scars open. 
 [woman singing opera] 
 Ahem. 
 That was my father's. 
 Second War, paratrooper. 
 Dropped men behind the lines at night. 
 Can't talk. Snipers. 
 So... 
 [clicking] 
 Crickets. 
 Wow. 
 [chuckle] 
 I just want you to know that working on this case has been a gift. 
 Yes. 
 I know that I stumbled at first, but I've grown. 
 I saw the video. 
 You surpassed all my expectations. 
 Thank you. 
 That' all I've ever wanted. 
 To stand in front of a jury, wow them with my eloquence, and... it's all thanks to you. 
 No. 
 And I want you to know that, no matter what happens in this case, it's not going to affect our feelings, is it? 
 No. 
 W-Why do you keep shoving these f*cking pictures at me? 
 I mean, they do get a closer look. 
 You got to be really strong to do that. 
 I don't even know what that means. 
 When do I get my car back? 
 That's it? 
 That's all you got to say to me? 
 He already told you he doesn't know anything. 
 No. You're the one that said that. 
 He hasn't asked a damn question. 
 Look, I know it doesn't look good, but there's not a law against having a dead snitch in your trunk. 
 So that's why you killed him? Because he was a snitch? 
 Yeah, that's it. Yeah. 
 Yeah, I killed him, I threw him in my trunk, and then I called you guys. 
 God damn. Be real, man. 
 Look, he has an alibi. 
 All right? All you have to do is call Donald Cooperman. That's it. 
 We called, and his assistant says he doesn't want to get involved. 
 Great, but you still have the photos that show that he was serving Cooperman a subpoena at the exact time that this guy was getting stabbed and put in my client's trunk. 
 This guy. 
 That's right. 
 What time was that? 
 Uh... 
 You said you knew the exact time. 
 Did I? 
 We don't know the exact time that this guy was stabbed. 
 Cool. Neither do I. 
 But I would like to know why are there people sticking dead bodies in your client's trunk. 
 To frame him, obviously. 
 We have motive. 
 Karl Stoltz was investigating two of your clients on a drug deal. 
 You want me to give you some more motive? 
 He killed my client and tried to kill me, so there you go. 
 Yeah, there's all kind of f*cking motive. 
 I get it. But you got no prints, no blood, no weapon, none of that sh1t. 
 So unless you're going to arrest me, I think we're done here. 
 Patty : No, so I thought I had more time this morning. 
 Man : Sorry. 
 Patty : Excuse me. 
 So I decided to make breakfast like an adult, And everyone saying "Avocado toast, avocado toast," so I'm there with an avocado in this hand and trying to get the pit out. 
 You call. The f*cking knife slips, right? 
 And it slices me right f*cking there on my middle finger, mind you, which I f*cking need. 
 And it's like four stitches, they're saying. 
 And I think there's, like, seven to ten days, and then it's going to be fine. 
 [cough cough] 
 But I've never had to deal with that before. 
 Talk to me. 
 Look, I'm... I'm telling you, it's... What's going on? 
 [muttering] 
 Oh, my God, what's going on? 
 What's going on? 
 Just talk to me. 
 Um... um... okay. 
 Uh, I don't... I don't know. Um... do you... How about a story? 
 Yeah? 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Um, so... 
 Uh, I f*cking do remember one. 
 Uh, there one... there once was an oyster whose story I tell that found that some sand had gotten into his shell. 
 It was only a grain, but it gave him great glee for oysters have feelings... 
 Just tell me it's going to be okay. 
 It's going to be okay. 
 You're fine. You're okay. 
 You're okay. 
 You're okay. 
 You're okay. 
 So you admit that you are a liar. 
 I lied about Ryan Larson, but that does not make me a liar. 
 To lie is to be a liar be definition. 
 Anan : If I may explain... 
 The question is not if you're a liar because you are. The question is, were you lying when you said he was suicidal or are you lying now? 
 Or when you broke your oath to the Church not to reveal the secrets of the confessional. 
 I would like to explain. 
 You have already tried. 
 You can try again with the jury. 
 Let's just hope none of them are Catholics or people who care about the truth. 
 Clearly Mr. McBride has bigger legal problems than our case. 
 Why hasn't he been charged yet? 
 Do you really think he killed someone? Come on. 
 I mean, I know you hate the guy, but... but murder? 
 He's killed others... not directly, but by his actions as a defense lawyer releasing killers. 
 This is a huge break for us, whether McBride gets charged or not. 
 It's a distraction for him. 
 Can you imagine the pressure that he's under? 
 Plus, it means that Patty... whatever her name is is going to have to bear more of the burden, which is great. She's never tried a case. 
 You've never tried a case. 
 I didn't go to Laverne Law School. 
 Wow. Look at you, so confident. 
 [click] 
 Lucy : Thank you. 
 So McBride is going to file for a continuance. 
 It would be malpractice not to. 
 And I say that we oppose it strongly. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Absolutely. 
 Every single day that this case drags on, Borns Tech is vulnerable to a decline in stock value, and that makes America vulnerable. 
 I mean, letting a nobody like Billy McBride hold up a great corporation with a frivolous and ridiculous lawsuit? 
 It's not just wrong, it endangers everything that matters to our c-c... c-c-c... c-c... 
 [deep inhale] 
 Country. 
 [exhale] 
 Ahem. 
 Lucy, do you need me to fill a prescription for you? 
 F... 
 [chuckle] 
 I'm fine. 
 Yeah. 
 You seem... fine. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm fine. 
 I swear. 
 I'm fine. 
 Man : So Rothenberg clearly feels that greed is ruining our society, but is that greed systemic or a result of individual choices? 
 Hello. Can I help you? 
 Hi. 
 Uh, yeah, Denise McBride, please. 
 Denise? 
 Denise McBride. 
 And who are you? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Come on. 
 Denise : Sorry. 
 It's okay. Go ahead. 
 Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 Boy, am I. 
 What is going on? 
 What happened to your hand? Is my dad okay? 
 It's avocado... 
 Did something happen? 
 Was there an accident? Why are you here? 
 Your dad's fine. Your dad's fine, okay? 
 He had a little bit of a panic attack. 
 Panic attack? Like a heart attack? 
 Is he in the hospital? 
 Like an anxiety attack. 
 He's fine, though. He wouldn't go to the hospital. 
 Of course he wouldn't. 
 It's like an anxiety thing, you know. 
 He's okay. 
 He's fine, okay? 
 I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to scare you. 
 Jesus, Patty. 
 I'm sorry. Look. 
 Uh, the reason... the reason why I'm... I'm here is, um... you seem to be the only person who knows how to ground him. 
 And he could really use that right now. 
 So if there's anything that you can do, I just... I'd really appreciate it. Okay? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 What do you mean? 
 This case. Why are any of you doing it? 
 It's destroying him. 
 It looks like it's destroying you. 
 My mom is acting like a complete crazy person. 
 Okay, with all due respect, your mother's not my f*cking problem. 
 Okay? And, uh, no one's getting paid for this. 
 So I don't know why the f*ck we're doing this. 
 But... everyone needs a reason to wake up in the morning, and it's a pretty good f*cking reason. 
 I'm having a day, okay? 
 Okay. 
 So... are you in? 
 Of course. 
 Great. 
 Go learn something. 
 His tongue and his dick were cut off. 
 LAPD didn't mention it? 
 No. 
 They didn't find his tongue, but his dick was in his mouth. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What the hell's happening here, man? 
 We honestly don't know. 
 But, obviously, someone's mad enough to send you a message, and he was the message. 
 But we don't know. 
 Here you go. 
 All records of foreign sales by Borns Tech of cluster bombs. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I asked Borns Tech. They just say they don't make them. 
 We're asking for all of Karl Stoltz' military records, too. 
 We need to tie him to Borns Tech and prove that they hired him to kill Rachel Kennedy. 
 That guy doesn't have any records. 
 Go serve the State Department, the Pentagon. DOD. 
 Oh, believe me, I'm gonna serve all of them. 
 I'm just starting with you. 
 I told you what I told you as a favor. 
 I understand that. 
 Sorry to be such an asshole, man, but I got to do what I got to do. 
 f*cking with the FBI over one case. 
 Sure you want to do that? 
 Yeah, pretty sure. 
 What's up, bud? What are you doing? 
 I'm drawing your picture. 
 Why would you be doing that? 
 You got a really good face. 
 Bullshit. Don't give me that. 
 No, no, really. You got some great character... 
 Who are you doing this for? Seriously. 
 Just for practice, just for the heck of it. 
 This is what I do. I sit here all day, and I draw... 
 You've been here all day? 
 ...people as they come by. 
 All day, yeah. 
 And you draw other people, too. 
 Yeah, plenty of them. 
 Let me see. 
 I can't because actually I gave them the pictures. 
 Would you like your picture? 
 You'll give it to me? 
 Absolutely. 
 Here we go. 
 All yours. 
 Enjoy. 
 Okay. 
 Sorry about that, man. You just never know. 
 You know what I mean? 
 It's not a problem. 
 Enjoy it. 
 Okay, buddy. 
 I haven't stuttered once in over six weeks. 
 But you stuttered yesterday and the day before. 
 It was on one word. 
 It was on one stupid little word. 
 And you know what the word was? 
 Country. 
 Country. And you know why I probably hit that word? 
 It was because I was in the presence of Callie, who's a card-carrying c-c-cunt. 
 [chuckle] 
 Good for you. 
 You no longer have a speaking part in the trial. 
 Okay, first of all, if I were to stutter in court, which I won't, but if I were, that would only serve to humanize me in front of the jury, which could run to the benefit of our very inhuman- and monstrous-seeming client. 
 You put me on this case because I'm smart and I'm talented, and I have done great work, thanks to you. 
 I've done it... behind the scenes, maybe, but I... I deserve to be seen doing it. 
 Shaken confidence does not serve the client or the firm. 
 My confidence is not shaken. 
 Mine is. 
 Come on. 
 I'm ready for this. 
 Let me do it. 
 Please. 
 You'll still be a valuable member of the team. 
 And a dear friend. 
 Are you breaking up with me? 
 [click] 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 Callie. 
 I hear you're back on top with Borns Tech. 
 Not surprising. You always seem to get what you want in the end. 
 The only thing I want in the world is you. 
 That's why... why I texted Denise: because I want to be a part of your life, all parts of your life. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Well, your methodology is disqualifying. 
 I'm so... I'm s... 
 I'm sorry... 
 You traumatized my daughter. 
 You traumatized me in the process. 
 We have no future together. 
 If you never believe anything I say again, believe that. 
 Hey. 
 If you care anything about what's left of your little family unit, you might want to tell your ex-husband to cry uncle because when I get done with him... 
 It's just difficult to destroy dads without daughters becoming collateral damage. 
 Sometimes ex-wives, too. 
 f*ck you. 
 Finally. You get stuck in the stairwell? 
 Move. 
 Let's look at the arrest report. 
 [chatter] 
 Man : Yeah. I'm on it. 
 You did all this? 
 It's impressive. 
 I hope my daughters grow up to be this capable. 
 You're a great lawyer, Lucy, with a great future. 
 But not everybody is cut out for trial work. 
 Woman : Are you done with that? 
 He did not! 
 Hey. 
 What do you want from me? 
 Dad, it's me. 
 I stuck out my neck for you. 
 Now you live up... [sigh] All right. What took you so long? They had to make the sh1t. Okay, so I got yours with no onions. How you like it. Dad, you at least have to take a bite of it. I will. You should call a doctor. I told you, it's just a panic attack. You sure your mom's okay with you staying here? Yeah, she seemed fine. Did you ask her? No. That's what I thought. Well, she's been really busy lately. She's on the phone more than usual. How's your mom and, uh, and your aunt Callie? How are they doing? Gross. I don't know. Okay? I don't ask. I don't blame you. Can you watch anything else? Yeah. Rudy or High Noon. [sigh] You sure you're okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Well, you look good. So... Yeah, okay. Thanks. And for what it's worth, I'm proud of you.

Parties are present, Your Honor. Be seated. Ahem. This matter is here for a status hearing. I'm looking at the file, but I see very little progress. I don't like that. Well, Your Honor, we've been conducting depositions and taking testimony... No. They've been doing depositions. In fact, from where I sit, you've done next to nothing since we last convened other than show up at my house uninvited. Your Honor, it would take two years to go through all the discovery they dumped on us, Plus, I'm dealing with this police matter right now. It is not my concern. My concern is this case. You're not getting two years to try this case. I'm not asking for that, Your Honor. Listen, this case either moves forward, or it stops. It's time to either put up or shut up, counsel. What's it going to be? Did you hear me, sir? Yes, sir, I heard you. Put up or shut up. The plaintiff chooses put up. I beg your pardon? [click] We call ready for trial. [whisper] What are you doing? [whispering] We're not ready for trial, Your Honor. Why not? You've got about a million lawyers working on this. [scoff] I call ready for trial. This is a dangerous game you're playing, Mr. McBride. You haven't gone through the discoveries. You haven't deposed their witnesses. Well, I have a pretty good idea what they're gonna all say. Judge : Do I understand this correctly? You're ready to proceed to trial now, today. Yes, sir, that's correct. Miss Senate? This is ridiculous. If he says he's ready for trial, the court takes him at his word. Callie : This is a stunt. Leonard : Your Honor, he is alleging negligence, which necessitates more discovery with respect to duty of care. This will take time. Okay, let's forget negligence. We'll just go with wrongful act and fraud. Excuse me? You're willing to waive the claims of negligence against Borns Tech? That's correct. That's your strongest cause of action. You open yourself up to malpractice. Well, instead of going with an innocent mistake, we're going to go with a conspiracy. You're willing to waive the negligence claim? I just did waive it. They say he killed himself. We say he didn't. We say Borns Tech had him working on an illegal weapon that blew him up. It's very simple. Your Honor, could I have a moment to, uh... Please. ...speak with my... people? Okay, thoughts? Nope, I don't like it. What are you talking about? There is no evidence of any intentional acts or of a cover-up. If he's willing to go with wrongful acts and fraud, we win. Mm-mm. Ahem. Counsel? Your Honor, we call ready for trial. [ Click] Well, isn't this interesting? Call down the voir dire panel. We're gonna pick us a jury. What I don't understand is how you don't warn me. Well, you haven't been listening to me. I wasn't sure I was going to do it when we went in. I had to see if they were ready. We're not ready! We're not ready. They're not, either. If they were ready, they would have brought a whole crew and a bunch of video equipment, a bunch more files, all kind of sh1t. So you in no way feel that this is rushed. We have no choice. I mean, I could get arrested any time. Oh, stop. Or maybe killed. Jesus Christ. Time's not exactly on our side here. Tomorrow? Hmm. The partners aren't happy, Donald. I wouldn't call it exactly a revolt, but there's definite rumbling... mostly about the Borns Tech case and your relationship with Lucy. That's over, and the partners' doubts will pass. Well... if... we win the Borns case, maybe. Or what? They'll replace me? I'd like to meet the man they have in mind. Or the woman. Listen. Please listen to me, Donald. People are concerned. You have been a rock... stable, rational. This case has tripped a wire somewhere. Ahem. Oh, my God. You are more like Billy than you realize. You both need someone to fight and to hate and to destroy. You can't just be. I loved Billy. I truly did. Once. We were quite a team. You couldn't stand him, Donald. Eventually no, but in the beginning I loved him. Until you didn't. Until I didn't because he was weak, because he drank, because he never really stood for anything. That's what you do. People fall, and you just let them keep falling. Oh, come on. Are you going to help Lucy? I know that you care about her. She just might be the one thing to make you happy. She made me happy. But she was weak. Ahem. Lawyers are reminded... opening statements are not arguments. They're road maps to let the juries know what evidence they can expect to hear. Plaintiff has the burden of proof and delivers the first opening statement. Billy : Cool. Um... okay, let's do this. 
 
 How are you guys doing? Sorry. I had a little bit of a kitchen accident. I was trying to get an avocado pit out, and I did the stab method instead of the chop. Took off like half my... Ahem! ...but I'm good to go. I know. I'm here. I'm here, you're here. Let's do this, right? So I am Patty Solis-Papagian. I represent Jason Larson. So two years ago, Ryan Larson, father of Jason, employee of Borns Tech, blew up on a boat owned by the defendant. What was he doing on the boat? Well, he was dumping explosives into the ocean. Completely illegal. Now, what were these explosives that he was dumping? Well, they were parts of an illegal weapon that was being made by Borns Tech. Get this: we have video of the explosion. Not only do we have video, we have the blueprints and the model of the weapon. We found them buried in his backyard. Guy had them buried in his backyard. At the end of the day, Borns Tech is no good. [clicking] They're just no good because they do dangerous things with hazardous materials, and they don't care who it affects. They could care less. And this is a trend that happens with big corporations all the time. Your Honor? Ford with the Pinto, Big Tobacco, NFL with the... Those cases have nothing to do with this case. The jury will disregard. Please disregard it. Please disregard it because that's exactly what they do to people like you and me. We are disregarded because, unless we make them money, unless you're putting cash in their pocket... Objection. Ms. Papagian... ...no value to them at all. Sustained. Uh, really, one more time, and you're done. All right. Well, I am done. Here's the thing. They're going to tell you that Ryan Larson was suicidal. Absolutely a lie. In no way was Ryan Larson suicidal. Thank you for your time. Hi. That was interesting. It's very impassioned. The evidence will show that Ryan Larson left a suicide note. Look, Borns Tech is in the business of protecting America from terrorism. That's what we do. Let me take this opportunity to introduce you to Leonard Letts, my co-counsel, and Lucy Kittridge. Lucy's brother died in the war effort. He went overseas, and he lost his life to enemy fire protecting this country and all the principles that we hold dear. Lucy's brother... Objection. ...wasn't a war profiteer. [whispering] He was a patriot. And so is Borns Tech. Look, we know that having a deep pocket means that sometimes you get subjected to extortion. It happens. But for them to saddle up a child... the child of a suicide victim... Where does it stop? Well, at the end of this case, I hope it stops there. You can go... prop. Ryan never talked about what he was working on, but I knew it made him very unhappy. He was very stressed. Now, did he ever talk about killing himself? No. Never. After he died, that's what Borns Tech told me happened, and I believed them. Why did you believe them? Shock, anger. I wasn't thinking clearly. It was easier to blame Ryan somehow, and I regret that. Right. You weren't thinking clearly. Hmm. But clearly well enough to take an enormous settlement from Borns Tech. I had my son to consider. You told us that Ryan was unhappy and stressed. At work. Not at home. I mean, everything okay with you two at home. Yes. Pretty much. Was he unhappy or stressed about anything between the two of you? No. It's your last chance to come clean. I had an affair. And how did that make him feel? Sad, maybe? The reason they're so powerful is because they got the resources, you know? They got investigators and a sh1t load of money, 200 or 300 little creeps running around there that can search the internet or research whatever they need, you know. Big operation. They got everything on everybody. Well... Sorry I'm late. Didn't you even know I was late? We started the trial. I'm sorry... I know. I was there for some of it. It's not going so good for your team. I don't know where this came from or what it means, so don't ask. That right there is the last favor I do for you. Hi. How's it going? Oh, no. What happened to your hand? Please go away. No? Mm-mm. Okay. Okay. Um... what? Oh. We got a couple of creeps, too. Right. Okay. So... these are Stoltz' military records from the Marines. Defense contractors hire ex-military. We may be able to connect him to Borns Tech that way. Yeah, but Stoltz was never mentioned in any of the Borns Tech files. Oh. We haven't gone through all of them yet. Besides, that's not going to be there. [cough] They'd never admit that he's theirs. What is this? That's part of a Borns Tech cluster bomb that just wiped out all those people you saw in the other images, all those women, children, civilians. Okay, we move to suppress this. Yeah, no sh1t. I'm sure you do. Our witness, who happens to be their ex-employee, will testify that this is the finished product of the model that we found buried in Ryan's backyard. Now, they're saying that they don't make cluster bombs, and this proves that they're lying. Ms. Senate? Obviously, these images are irrelevant. There are no markings that identify it as a Borns Tech product. There's no reason to think that our client had anything to do with making or selling that. Our witness will testify that this was built to Borns Tech blueprints and of the Borns Tech model. Okay, this is trial by surprise bullshit, Your Honor. We don't know what that is or where it came from... Your Honor. ...even if it's real. You sure it didn't look familiar to you, Leonard? Its probative value is substantially outweighed by their prejudicial impact on the jury, and we've had no time to review them. The images are disallowed. Oh, come on. Why? Are you kidding me? It lacks foundation and is unduly prejudicial. The images are disallowed. Judge, are you going to let me put on a case here or not? Mr. McBride... Mr. McBride, call your next witness or rest. Based on your professional knowledge and experience, what do you think happened to Ryan Larson? Based on the size of the explosion taken from the video by the fishermen, it was caused by a large amount of the napalm-based fuel and something else, too: munitions. What do you mean? Do you mean bombs? We don't like to use the term "bombs," but yes, bombs. Did Ryan Larson ever work on cluster bombs? Officially? Mm-hmm. Nobody worked on cluster bombs at Borns Tech. Officially, we didn't make them. They're banned, indiscriminate devices that killed way too many civilian women and kids. So earlier, Gina Larson testified that this was found buried in her backyard. Can you tell us what this is? Well, that right there is a model of a banned weapon using illegal fuel and cluster bombs which Borns Tech developed. Okay. And with this model we found these guys. Can you tell us what these are? Those are blueprints for what appears to be a cluster bomb system. Thank you. Nothing further. Thank you. Mr. Berring, you were fired from Borns Tech because of mental health issues relating to fantasy and occasionally hearing voices. Okay, but that... that's... it's... Yes, amongst other things. Including anger. Anger's a big one for you, isn't it? You sought revenge against an ex-girlfriend for breaking up with you by posting a video of the two of you having s*x on the internet without her consent. Isn't that true? Yes, it's... it's correct, but I... I'm deeply... ashamed. So you get angry, and you take revenge. That's what you do. You did it to a woman that you loved, and now you're doing it to the company that fired you. That's not a question. No. Here's the question. Yes or no, the model on the blueprints that you were just talking about, did any of them have the Borns Tech name or any identifying markings on them? Not that I know of, no. They could have been made by anybody. I mean, for all we know, they could be Ryan Larson's design. I mean, yes, but that... that wouldn't be feasible. Yes. I suppose so. Nothing further. [street noises] [footsteps] Hi. I went by your office. I saw your stuff was still there, so I figured you might have come up here. Clever of me. Here. It's liberating to do the wrong thing sometimes. Most of the time. What generation of feminism are we up to now? Fifth wave? Or sixth? I don't... I've lost count. I do know that it is still... really hard. It takes grit, resolve. When I look at you, Lucy, I see how smart you are and how hard you work. I see how much you want it. But you don't have it. You don't even begin to have it, and you never, ever will. [feet shuffling] He sent me to tell you you're fired. Well, not fired. If anyone asks, we'll say you left of your own accord. We wish you well. Why do you hate me so much? I don't hate you, Lucy. After tonight, I won't even remember you were here. [sobbing] Uh, there were two big booms. Um, that's the second one. You can see the fire. Mm-hmm. All the burning plastic coming down. Uh, then came the wave. The wave that sank your boat. Yeah. Now, after the first time we spoke, what happened? This guy came to us... uh, Karl Stoltz... and he said that there was a shipment... Objection. Hearsay. Sustained. The jury will disregard. Why are you dressed like that, Gabriel? Uh, after we first talked to you about the boat, this guy Stoltz showed up to set us up on a drug deal. Your Honor. He framed us. Why would he do that? Objection. Speculation. Sustained. Mr. McBride, do you have any other questions for the witness? Yes, sir. I have plenty more... about Karl Stoltz, but you won't let me ask them. That line of questioning has been shut down. Please move on, sir. Gabriel... um... Well, Your Honor, I'm a little stuck here. Ms. Senate. You have no idea what made that boat blow up, do you, Mr. Marquez? Not really. Thank you. Officer, Mr. Marquez is done. Mr. McBride, call your next witness. Mr. McBride. Mr. McBride! I... Do you have another witness? Yes, your Honor. The plaintiff would like to call Wendell Corey to the stand. He's not on the witness list. He's not even here. He doesn't have to be on the list. He's a party to the action. Mr. Corey has no information about what transpired on that boat. Oh, that's great. Let him testify to that. Your Honor, this is unfair surprise. We have the right to call him. If you disagree, I'll file an emergency appeal. We'll drag this thing out forever. We can talk about it all day if you want. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Get Mr. Corey in here. Your Honor... we respectfully ask for time to consider filing a motion to preclude this testimony. I respectfully deny your request. Get Mr. Corey in here. Now! So I got to put my ass in the hot seat now? He has nothing. [click] Really? You sure of that, huh, Donald? I am. What if he does have something? [click] Huh? You know what I suggest? I'd suggest we give these fuckers $10 million and get this over with now. Try not to be stupid, Wendell. Lord knows you're capable of it. And don't go weak on me after all I've done for you. [scoff] Donald... After all you've done for me. [clicking] You condescending asshole. How about the nearly billion dollars in fees we've paid you over the years? When you illegally tested and developed items to get a jump on the market, I protected you from clear and massive violations of Federal rules and regulations! You know what? Whatever you did, you got paid for it, didn't you? [click] We made mistakes. Okay? But I'll tell you what we didn't do. We didn't kill anyone. How about you, Donald? Did you kill anyone? No. Don't tell me... Hey. You f*cking asshole. Wendell. You know what? You're out of your f*cking mind, Donald. I'm going to shove that riding crop up your ass. How about that? f*ck you, Donald! I know who you are. Remember that. I know who you are. Hey. Hey. I forgot my charger in there. Oh, okay. Yeah, and I brought you something. Really? Yeah. For me, huh? Uh-huh. For you. Drum roll... Da da da Nice. [chuckle] With real cane sugar. It's your favorite. Yeah, it's the real thing. It's warm, but it's still good. That's all right. I'll put it in the fridge in a little bit. Thank you. Yeah. I thought today went pretty good. Right? Anything I can do to help? Uh... shoot me. Come on. You're okay, right? Uh... I don't even know anymore. You're really good at this, Billy. You're going to be great. Okay. well, if you don't need me, then I got a date. So see you tomorrow. Okay? Yeah. Good luck, baby. I thought you forgot your charger. Oh. Yeah. [chuckle] I'm such an idiot, right? It's been a really long day. Yeah. God. I hear you. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Corey. Wendell's fine. As I understand it, you make a lot of money by killing people. We're defense contractors. We employ Americans that build the tools to defend the country. Hmm. And you also sell these tools to Russia and China and Saudi Arabia and Yemen, places like that. If the price is right. The United States government authorized those sales. A couple of those countries are partners of ours in the war on terror. Now, part of this money you made came from the sale of napalm, am I right? Napalm's not a banned weapon. If you use it against civilians it is. We don't use it against civilians. So you sell it to a bunch of countries who do use it against civilians. Callie : Objection. May I? Billy : This is all on public record. My aunt could find it. There's been another partners meeting. Sustained. Sustained? W-We were just talking about this two minutes ago. Those countries are not relevant to this case, Mr. McBride. I was getting to something. Objection sustained. So, banned or not, would you agree that it's illegal to test napalm off the coast of Santa Monica? We don't do that. But you've done it in the past. You know what? A lot of defense contractors tested various toxic materials in the past. We don't do it now. Do you make cluster bombs? We're not licensed to, no. Okay. So in other words, if you got caught making them or testing them, then you'd be fined or go to prison or both. Objection. Argumentative. You know what? I already told you this. We never tested or made them. Okay? Then why did Ryan Larson have a model of a cluster bomb buried in his backyard? Objection, Your Honor. Lacks foundation. Sustained. Mr. Corey, all the rules about what fuel and weapons can be made or tested are waived during wartime, right? So our troops get all the weapons they need to fight the bad guys. No. No. I mean, a lot of them. Congress can pass what's called a Wartime Suspension Act and give us room to make what we need, regardless of the legal ramifications, yeah. So hypothetically, you could get a waiver to test napalm in the ocean or to build cluster bombs, even though that's against the law. Hypothetically, I suppose we could, yes. Who would apply for those waivers? You and who else? Our lawyers. Hmm. So Mr. Letts right here, Mr. Leonard Letts? Actually, no, not Mr. Letts. Well, he's your general counsel, so if it's not him, who is it? Donald Cooperman. Donald Cooperman? Yeah. So if you wanted to get one of these waivers to test napalm or build a cluster bomb, who would you ask? Donald Cooperman. Did he ever allow Ryan Larson or anyone else at Borns Tech to design or make cluster bombs? I have no idea. Who would know? Donald Cooperman. Did a man named Karl Stoltz ever work for Borns Tech or any of its subsidiaries? No. I mean, not that I recall. Which one is it, no or you don't recall? You know what? A lot of people work for Borns Tech. Thousands. I can't keep track of all of them, and I don't recognize that name. Hmm. Recognize that guy? No. Huh-uh. You're not looking at it, sir. How would you know? Sure I am. Do you think it's possible that he was a former Marine who worked for your subsidiary in Dubai? Employee ID number 32823? Handled security over there, and then he came back to the States to work for you here? I don't have any idea. Who would know for sure? Main counsel for personnel matters. Donald Cooperman. Once again, Donald Cooperman. Mr. McBride, do you have any more questions for this witness? Oh, no, Your Honor, I don't. I'm sorry. I... I think he's said all he's going to say. We just have one more witness to call. We'd like to call Donald Cooperman to the stand. [laughing] f*ck. [beep] Jesus. [snickering] Billy can't make you testify. The attorney-client privilege absolutely prevents it. Well, Callie must have showed him how, but Wendell opened the door. To what? He claims that I advised them that they could break the law. Did you? No. [laughing] [scoff] Doesn't matter. Does not matter. They cannot make you get on that stand. [laughing] Make me? Try to stop me. Me versus Billy. Once and for all. Oh, where have you been Billy boy, Billy boy? Oh, where have you been... Charming Billy? I have been to seek a wife. She's the joy of my life. She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother... [knock on door] Who is it? It's Callie. Hi, Billy. Hey. What's up? Am I interrupting? No. I was just playing cards by myself here. Nothing too exciting. What, you're not going to invite me in? Yeah, sure. Come on in. So this is the infamous Ocean Lodge. Yeah, infamous is a pretty good way to put it, I'll say. Have a seat. No, I'm all right. I'm not staying. I just came to drop this off. Thought I would do it in person. Professional courtesy. Not anthrax, is it? It's our witness list. Good luck, Billy. Yeah, you, too. [exhale]
