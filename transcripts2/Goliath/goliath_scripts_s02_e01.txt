 Hey, hi. 
  Mr. 
  McBride. 
  Right? 
  Are you by chance Billy McBride? 
  - Huh? 
  The Billy McBride. 
  - Goddamn it. 
  I got a civil case. 
  A friend of mine, her brother worked for Borns Technology and he died on one of their boats. 
  Your old firm's big kahuna client, they told her that her brother killed himself, but she's convinced he didn't. 
  Okay. 
  Come on. 
  Here. 
  I Googled you, you know. 
  Did Google happen to say what became of me? 
  You drink too much. 
  That's not accurate. 
  I drink just the right amount. 
  He was already drunk. 
  And this isn't me just ripping on my ex. 
  This was one of the best trial lawyers ever. 
  Juries used to love you. 
  At one point, they loved me so much, I could do anything I wanted, just about. 
  But that can be dangerous. 
  The idea of you and my f*cked up sister-in-law tearing open wounds to chase some big pot of gold I'm chasing the truth, Ms. 
  Larson. 
  That's all I'm doing. 
  - Bullshit. 
  - Aren't you interested in the truth? 
  A Gina Larson called. 
  Billy McBride visited her. 
  I went and saw the dead guy's wife. 
  She's hiding something. 
  I think there's a bigger picture here. 
  All I know is what I saw. 
  The Marquez boys told me that this rained down on them after the explosion. 
  - Where is it from? 
  - I don't know. 
  We're gonna have to hire an explosives expert. 
  Yes. 
  It's a war crime. 
  And if Borns Tech really did work on this, then Borns Tech are f*cking monsters and they will kill you before they let you prove it. 
  Did that dude just take a picture of us? 
  This boyfriend of yours, what does he look like? 
  It's not him, Dad. 
  Ever since I took this case, weird sh1t is happening to me, okay? 
  People are following me. 
  I'm getting pulled over by the cops, having my ass beat. 
  At the end of the day, they're big and we're little, and they're gonna kill us and I am terrified. 
  We're still in the game. 
  That's the good news. 
  Think about what's going down in this case, then ask yourself how much more of it you can take, how many more people are going to get hurt. 
  Consider one dead client. 
  It's terrible. 
  We just have one more witness to call. 
  We'd like to call Donald Cooperman to the stand. 
  Miss Kittridge is going to say that Mr. 
  Stoltz had a conversation with you. 
  - Oh. 
  - Mr. 
  Cooperman! 
  Good luck, Billy. 
  It's our witness list. 
  What did you expect me to do? 
  I expect you to be my f*cking friend! 
  You were never my friend because I f*ck guys for a living and you thought that I'd be handy for you! 
  - What? 
  - That was it! 
  The jury awards the Larson family damages in the amount of $162 million. 
  Burns you up to think I beat you. 
  Oh, your friend, Rachel Kennedy, she wasn't the one we were trying to get. 
  You were supposed to get it. 
  She took yours. 
  DEA, search warrant! 
  DEA, search warrant! 
  Down on the ground now! 
  Two left, two left! 
  Get your ass on the ground! 
  Two right! 
  Don't do it! 
  Suspect down! 
  Move! 
  Move! 
  Right clear! 
  Keep moving. 
  Rest of the house is clear. 
  All clear. 
  Last room. 
  That's a lot of f*cking money. 
  f*ckin' "A. 
  " A joint task force headed by the LAPD and the DEA are zeroing in on the La Mano Cartel's opioid distribution ring operating in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. 
  Over $25 million in drugs and cash have been seized so far. 
  City councilwoman and mayoral candidate Marisol Silva has been spearheading the political pressure to eradicate drugs in her district. 
  That's why we're working hand in hand with the DEA, to stop these drug distribution networks. 
  And as your next mayor of Los Angeles, it will be my priority to provide treatment for those who are affected by opioid addiction. 
  In other news, officers responded to a report of a fight in progress at a 7-Eleven in the 600 block of Wilshire and Santa Monica. 
  When they arrived You gonna take him home? 
  Yeah. 
  I got him. 
  Be right back. 
  Take your time. 
  I'm gonna be here late. 
  You want me to send the guys home? 
  No, tell them to wait for me. 
  I don't want you here alone. 
  Bus stop will be lonely without them, anyways. 
  Could you grab my hoodie - for me, please? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Hey, Billy. 
  - Mm? 
  Billy, come on. 
  Let's go home.

  It don't feel like me or look like me. 
  But the salesman, this cat gave me a pitch. 
  He said his wife was sick, and I'm saving the planet and all this sh1t, you know, so Yeah.

  I'm embarrassed, I-I guess. 
  Um not embarrassed, but I-I don't know the words for it. 
  Uh It's okay, Oscar. 
  What is it? 
  You know my, uh my sons my two older boys. 
  Yeah, yeah, I know them. 
  They're not in some gang sh1t again, are they?

  How you doing? 
  Same old sh1t, you know. 
  - Yeah, I hear you. 
  - Yeah. 
  Okay, um Uh, I've been going to these-these meetings, and, um I just came to apologize to you. 
  I mean, I've been apologizing to a lot of people lately, and, um you're at the top of my list. 
  So I'm sorry for everything I put you through. 
  'Cause the thing is, like, I know what I did was wrong, but I don't even know why I did it. 
  I just I was just mixed up in my own sh1t, and, uh and I took it out on you. 
  And I betrayed you. 
  I guess I didn't deserve your friendship. 
  And I'm sorry. 
  Okay. 
  Okay, um Well, in case I never see you again just know that I love you. 
  Okay, bye. 
  Hey, Brittany. 
  Hang on a second. 
  Got something for you. 
  It's for the Borns Tech case. 
  It's what I owe you. 
  Are you serious? 
  But I stabbed you in the back. 
  Well, it's for your work, it's not a humanitarian award, okay. 
  Thank you. 
  You're welcome. 
  Hey, Brittany. 
  Thanks for coming over. 
  It was big of you to say all that. 
  What's up, Oscar? 
  How you holding up, buddy? 
  I didn't tell you everything about my sons. 
  All right. 
  Well, my youngest son got arrested. 
  Your younger son? 
  You talking about the fiddle player? 
  Cello. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, Julio. 
  The hell for? 
  The cops are saying that he killed somebody. 
  That it's gang retaliation for my other sons, but it don't make any sense. 
  - Well, no. 
  - I mean, no, they were in the gang. 
  Julio's not. 
  He's a good kid. 
  Yeah. 
  I don't have any money for a good lawyer. 
  I mean, I-I can give you some money. 
  I mean, I-I'll help you any way I can like that, but, I mean, if you're talking about me, I I kind of gave up murder cases and cocaine right around the same time. 
  Don't really do that anymore, so Yeah, I-I I don't know what lawyer does what. 
  He's got a public defender, right? 
  Yeah. 
  It just looks like he's going down. 
  Public defender just means you're f*cked, doesn't it? 
  Well, not necessarily. 
  I mean, they handle those cases all the time. 
  They know the ins and outs, you know. 
  I mean, I-I can go down and check on him for you and talk to the lawyer, see that everything's square, you know. 
  Thank you, Billy. 
  No sweat, man. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - Oh, don't be. 
  I'm happy to. 
  You sure you don't need any money? 
  Thank you. 
  Damn it. 
  Yeah, I don't know. 
  I just don't drive hardly at all now. 
  Too much traffic? 
  Well, all kind of f*cking reasons. 
  You ever wonder where the hell people are going? 
  - No. 
  - I do. 
  I just assume they're going nowhere in a hurry. 
  Yeah. 
  Thanks, man. 
  Hey, Julio. 
  You remember me? 
  Billy McBride, buddy of your dad's from Chez Jay. 
  I remember you. 
  I met you before. 
  Yeah, a couple times. 
  So I just, uh wanted to come by and check on you, see if they're treating you okay. 
  And if they're not, you can tell me, okay? 
  I didn't kill anybody. 
  I don't figure you did. 
  I went by and saw your public defender, Ms. 
  Blanchard. 
  - The blonde lady? 
  - Yeah, she seems like a pretty capable gal, you know. 
  Yeah, so, I just want to make sure you had somebody, you know, to take care of you. 
  I think you're in good hands with her. 
  But I do have to ask you, um, where were you that night of those murders? 
  I was home, just doing schoolwork and practicing for the orchestra. 
  That's what your dad said, too. 
  When will I be able to talk to my dad and my girlfriend? 
  You can talk to them pretty soon. 
  Can I ask you a question? 
  Sure. 
  You're a lawyer, right? 
  Yeah, I am. 
  Why can't you help me? 
  I didn't do this. 
  I-I I understand that. 
  I really believe you. 
  But I don't do capital cases, that's what your case is. 
  It's not really my bag right now. 
  Okay. 
  You're probably real scared. 
  That's natural. 
  Anybody would be. 
  Just keep your head down, do what your lawyer tells you, and she'll sort it all out. 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  I'll come back and check on you again. 
  Yeah. 
  I'll tell your dad I saw you. 
  Give him a hug for you. 
  - Thank you. 
  - You got it. 
  How's your mom? 
  She's good. 
  We actually got along. 
  Well, that's good. 
  Is she okay? 
  Yeah, she wants me to come back to London to visit over winter break. 
  She's dating a woman whose family owns a castle. 
  What, is she some kind of princess or something? 
  No, I just, I think they just own a castle. 
  There you go, bud. 
  Appreciate it. 
  Whoa. 
  Thanks a lot, brother. 
  All right, honey. 
  Did you just give that guy a $200 tip? 
  - Yeah, I'm sure he can use it. 
  - That's very nice of you. 
  Well Oh, my gosh, I haven't seen a blue sky in so long. 
  Yeah, I bet. 
  I've missed it. 
  The palm trees and kale salads. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  Standard thing for people to say is, "You know, the food's gotten a lot better in London. 
  " - Mm. 
  - They've been saying that for 30 f*cking years. 
  There it is, honey. 
  - Holy crap. 
  - Yeah. 
  - This one? 
  - Yeah. 
  - This is our house? 
  - Yeah. 
  You freaking kidding me? 
  Dad, it's gorgeous. 
  How much did it cost? 
  More than it would if it were in Pacoima. 
  Hmm. 
  I'll Zillow it. 
  Hurry up, hurry up. 
  God, I'm starving. 
  Do we have anything to eat? 
  Yeah, there-there's Don't even bother. 
  I forgot to go to the grocery store, honey. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - Wow. 
  You can just fill it up with whatever you want to. 
  - Dad. 
  - I know. 
  I-I know, I know. 
  Are you still living at the Ocean Lodge? 
  Well, I figured I'd wait till you got back, you know, before I moved in here. 
  What the hell am I gonna do with this place by myself? 
  - So, work's been keeping you busy? 
  - Oh, yeah, yeah. 
  - You working? 
  - Yeah, off and on, you know. 
  Bits and pieces here and there. 
  So what do you, like, do all day? 
  Different stuff, you know. 
  What do you do all day? 
  How's the drinking? 
  It's great. 
  Going great. 
  Come on. 
  You just got here, let's not start that sh1t, okay, please? 
  You're not eating. 
  You're drinking more. 
  You're pissing away all your money, and you're still living at the motel, - and I'm worried about you. 
  - What-what are you? 
  Sam Spade or something? 
  How do you know what I'm doing? 
  Dad I know because Marva told me. 
  - But you can't tell her - You sneaky little sh1t. 
  that I told you. 
  I promised I wouldn't say anythihng. 
  - W-What the f*ck is this? 
  - You're really making a big deal out of nothing. 
  - Uh, you barely said - And not you. 
  Anything about the house. 
  - I mean, it's great, Dad. 
  - Look. 
  Yeah, exactly. 
  It's great, I said that. 
  I said it was great. 
  I mean, it's a fake orange. 
  What does that have to do with anything? 
  What do you want me to say? 
  It's-it's beautiful. 
  It looks very clean. 
  Okay. 
  I'm sorry, it's-it's really nice. 
  - I love it. 
  - Yeah, well, good. 
  Anyway, welcome home, honey. 
  What's up, Marva? 
  - Oh! 
  You're up. 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh. 
  I brought you some chicken salad. 
  Well, I appreciate that, honey, but you don't have to keep - doing this, all right? 
  - Oh, I just want to make sure that you're eating. 
  Okay, so "frequentation of daze," D-A-Z-E? 
  Frequentation? 
  Seven letters. 
  Um "Tripping"? 
  No. 
  - One-one letter too many. 
  Yeah. 
  - Oh. 
  Maybe "triping. 
  " Don't want that, do we? 
  So how does, uh how's Denise like the new house? 
  You should know, since you guys are big pen pals now, huh? 
  - Busted. 
  - Yeah. 
  She just worries about you. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  Well, I will let you be. 
  Um Just let me know if you need anything, okay? 
  Okay, I will. 
  Thanks, honey. 
  Okay, good. 
  Oh, and, Marva, you know, Denise doesn't need to know everything about me. 
  You got that, right? 
  I'm good at keeping secrets. 
  Not so far. 
  I'll be better. 
  Okay. 
  Bye-bye. 
  Bye. 
  f*ck is 67? 
  Mr. 
  McBride? 
  Yeah. 
  Hi, I'm Marisol Silva. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  - Yeah, you, too. 
  The manager at the motel said I'd find you here. 
  Yeah, he'd know. 
  Um, I'm a friend of the Suarez family, and I reached out to Oscar, and he he said you visited Julio. 
  Yeah. 
  Are you taking his case? 
  - No. 
  - Oh, I, uh I got the impression from Oscar that you were taking his case. 
  Nah, that was a misunderstanding. 
  I visited Julio, but I just went to check in on him, see if he had good representation and all. 
  So does he? 
  - Yeah, I think so. 
  - Good. 
  Good, good, good. 
  He's very special to me. 
  I-I watched him grow up, and he's very talented, and he has a good heart. 
  Yeah, he seems like an okay kid. 
  I hope he's doing all right. 
  I guess he's as all right as an innocent kid in jail can be, you know? 
  Would you visit him again? 
  Uh it will make me feel better if you do. 
  I'm sure I will. 
  Thank you. 
  I don't know when I can get in and see him. 
  I'm sure running for mayor takes up a lot of time, huh? 
  See, I I couldn't tell if you recognized me or not. 
  Some people don't follow politics. 
  Yeah, I keep up a little. 
  Um, well, I know you're not his lawyer, but if there's anything I can do to help in his case, call me, please. 
  All right. 
  Here. 
  This is my card. 
  You know what? 
  I'm gonna give you my personal phone. 
  Okay. 
  So, uh have a good night. 
  Yeah, you, too. 
  Oh, hang on a second. 
  Why don't you stick around and have one with me? 
  Have one what? 
  Oh, you know, have a little drink. 
  - Oh, uh - You know, a drink. 
  It wouldn't look good for a mayoral candidate to be-be drinking out of a bottle on the pier. 
  There's eyes everywhere, and social media's a bitch. 
  Yeah, I guess so. 
  There's really hardly anybody out here, though. 
  There's not a f*cking soul down there. 
  Pardon my French. 
  No, well, you never know. 
  But thank you so much for the offer. 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  - Maybe another time. 
  - Yeah. 
  - You know, with glasses, and everything. 
  - Cool. 
  - Okay. 
  Oh, let me ask you a question. 
  Uh-huh? 
  Do I look depressed to you? 
  Depressed? 
  Uh - Well, my daughter says I'm depressed. 
  - Oh. 
  Oh, I see. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I'm-I'm sorry. 
  - I should I'm sorry. 
  No, I shouldn't be telling you personal things like that, - you know? 
  I'm sorry, we just met. 
  - No, it's okay. 
  Really. 
  You know? 
  I mean, it's kind of stupid. 
  I tend to think about the past a lot, instead of the future, so maybe that's part of it, I know. 
  See, there I go again saying personal sh1t to you. 
  - It's okay. 
  It's fine. 
  - Sorry about that. 
  Uh, I better go now. 
  - Yeah. 
  - But thank you for the offer. 
  You need me to walk you to your car or anything? 
  No, it's fine. 
  - You sure? 
  - Yes. 
  Hey, you're pretty cool - for a mayor. 
  - Thank you. 
  But I'm not a mayor yet. 
  It was up to me, you would be. 
  What's up, Roman? 
  - Hey, man. 
  - Hey. 
  Appreciate you coming out. 
  Yeah, I didn't know this was your case. 
  No, it's not. 
  Uh, I'm doing it for a friend. 
  Another lawyer? 
  Nah, I know the suspect's dad. 
  - Huh. 
  - Rough deal. 
  Yeah, well, it's-it's too bad 'cause, uh, this one's pretty cut and dried. 
  You mind showing me through? 
  I owe you one, by the way. 
  No. 
  No, you don't, 'cause this never happened. 
  I hear you. 
  - How's the family? 
  - Okay. 
  - I got a new one. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Keeping you up nights? 
 
 
 
  Oh, absolutely. 
  f*cking crazy. 
  Yeah, I'll bet. 
  So the first victim is Marcos PeÃ±a. 
  He was shot from the doorway. 
  Had a 9mm on him. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Not fired. 
  Victim number two is Hunter Friedman. 
  Tried to run. 
  Hunter was unarmed. 
  Huh. 
  That's interesting. 
  So what's the white kid's deal, anyway? 
  He's a rich kid from Brentwood. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Goes to a private school. 
  His parents are hotshots in entertainment law. 
  - Was he here buying? 
  - That's what we're thinking. 
  There's almost 40 grand in cash, and a shit-ton of pills. 
  You don't leave that behind if it's a straight-up robbery. 
  Uh, our theory is that your friend's son took out Marcos, someone we were circling for the murder of his own brothers, and the Friedman kid was collateral damage. 
  Well, that's the obvious theory. 
  Well, nine times out of ten, obvious is right. 
  Occam's razor? 
  You know, the kid's got an alibi, Keith. 
  Who's that? 
  Your buddy? 
  His dad? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  We've got an eyewitness, says the Suarez kid was here, Billy. 
  - Who's the eyewitness? 
  - Guy across the street. 
  He was out walking his dog under the overpass. 
  - By a dirty couch? 
  - By a dirty couch. 
  He said he heard gunshots, and then he saw somebody matching the Suarez kid's description come running out of the house, go up the hill, past the chain-link fence. 
  Huh. 
  Okay. 
  - Okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  I should get you out of here, Billy. 
  All right. 
  I appreciate it. 
  Good to see you. 
  You, too, man. 
  Hey, buddy! 
  Come here a minute. 
  What do you want? 
  Just come here! 
  Can you help me do something? 
  No. 
  All right, I was gonna give you a hundred bucks, but if you don't want it, I'll just get some other little sh1t to do it. 
  f*ck you, man. 
  That's not very good language, is it? 
  To do what? 
  See that little blue house down there? 
  I want you to stand at the door, and then I want you to run around the side, and up by that chain-link fence up to the next street there. 
  That's it. 
  Is this some bullshit so you can just steal my bike? 
  The hell would I want with your bike? 
  It's not even big enough for you. 
  Give me the money first. 
  Little businessman, aren't you? 
  All right. 
  There you go. 
  Give me the bike. 
  I'll give it to you after, okay? 
  - Okay, man. 
  - All right. 
  You ready? 
  Yeah! 
  Go for it. 
  Shot! 
  Good. 
  Every time. 
  - Come on. 
  - You like that, Romie? 
  - Back, back, back. 
  - You like that? 
  You gonna bring it? 
  - Come on. 
  - You gonna bring it? 
  - Ball, ball, ball! 
  - Take me! 
  Ah, f*ck! 
  Goddamn it! 
  Told you. 
  - The f*ck, dude? 
  - I told him to stay out. 
  I f*cking pull up with a hamstring, and you f*cking tackle me. 
  - You serious? 
  - Yes. 
  What, I'm supposed to know that? 
  Jesus Christ, Danny. 
  Uncle Creaky. 
  Dude, I'm sorry, brother, but you know you can't take me off - the dribble. 
  - This is f*cking ridiculous, man. 
  I was so far past you when you tackled me, it's f*cking ridiculous. 
  Aw, you're gonna cry about it? 
  f*ck you. 
  Dude. 
  Just get a massage, put it on me. 
  - I'm-a take you up on that. 
  - That's why I offered. 
  Seriously, go to Koreatown. 
  Get yourself a handy. 
  Yeah, that's just what I need. 
  - f*cking STD from Koreatown. 
  - Yeah. 
  So listen, we're still in good shape, right? 
  They still got that kid in custody. 
  Yeah. 
  You're a lucky prick. 
  I'd say we're both pretty lucky. 
  Well, my luck better not run out, 'cause I had somebody primed and ready to take the fall for this. 
  Use him on the next one. 
  I'm not doing this again. 
  My stomach is in f*cking knots. 
  Well, get over your f*cking stomach. 
  Take some f*cking Pepto-Bismol. 
  You're serious? 
  Dude, you don't f*cking get this. 
  I got a call. 
  Billy McBride is sniffing around this case. 
  - Who the f*ck is Billy McBride? 
  - He's a f*cking lawyer who just won $50 million in a wrongful death suit, okay. 
  - I've known him for years. 
  - Never heard of him. 
  - He's a bulldog, all right? 
  - I don't give a f*ck what he is. 
  - If he latches onto this - I'm not scared, dude. 
  he's not letting go. 
  I'm not f*cking scared. 
  We're so lucky right now, we should be out playing the f*cking lottery, okay? 
  I don't need to play the lottery, right? 
  You're gonna send me a text, right? 
  Yeah. 
  That's how we do it, right? 
  Did you check your phone? 
  - Did you? 
  - I'll check it. 
  You'll check it. 
  Check your f*cking texts. 
  Look, dude, I got to go. 
  Give my love to Mary. 
  Ice that thing down, okay? 
  - Headed out, Mr. 
  Roman? 
  - Yeah. 
  Roberto, I, uh if I can make it to my car. 
  I pulled my hamstring playing hoops. 
  Can use the employee entrance if you want. 
  It's quicker. 
  I'll be okay. 
  Thanks. 
  Just don't ever get old. 
  I'm not planning on it. 
  Thanks. 
  Have a good day. 
  Motherfucking f*ck! 
  Danny, I can hear you stress-eating. 
  Okay, what do we got here? 
  We got Carl's Jr. 
  or Panda Express. 
  What is it? 
  It's a Famous Star with Cheese. 
  Why do you f*cking care what I'm eating? 
  Oh, God. 
  But a diet soda, right? 
  Yeah, look, did you see the f*cking picture? 
 ! 
  Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. 
  And are you sure that's the same kid? 
  Yeah, I'm f*cking positive, man! 
  It's a huge f*cking billboard. 
  It's one of those kids from her-her community center project or whatever. 
  Okay, all right, I can see how this could be a huge problem. 
  So, I will talk to her, but don't panic, okay? 
  Relax. 
  You can see where it's a huge problem? 
  Tom, listen to me, you need to be very f*cking clear with her, okay? 
  Danny, Danny, I'm going to be very me with her, which is how we got this far in the first place. 
  - No, being you is not a good - Bye-bye. 
  So, the whole time Marisol's talking to him, all I can focus on is this piece of banana stuck in his beard. 
  Yes, the banana in the beard. 
  I love that story, uh, but I do think it's time to be done with the small talk. 
  Love small talk, but how's Mr. 
  Vargas doing? 
  Uh, we're not quite there yet, but I'm-I'm working on him. 
  Okay, well, I have the investors excited, the time to strike is now. 
  - I need to get that property rezoned. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  So, what can we do to get Vargas's vote? 
  I think a soccer field for his youth program will probably lock it in. 
  Done. 
  E-mail Loomis. 
  What else? 
  Wait, you don't even want to know how much it costs? 
  No, I do not. 
  I already know it's a drop in the bucket compared to the big picture. 
  What else does he need? 
  I think a soccer field will be fine for now. 
  If he needs anything else, I'll let you know. 
  Good. 
  Well, I think that makes us done here. 
  Um, we should talk about Julio Suarez. 
  - Tom - Marisol - Okay, ju-just listen to me. 
  - I'm listening. 
  I've known him since he was eight. 
  - I know. 
  I know. 
  - He's one of my kids. 
  A success story for the community center, which is the foundation of my campaign. 
  - Listen, I understand. 
  - Yeah. 
  Now I'm gonna tell you something insensitive, shitty, but true. 
  You need to distance yourself from this kid. 
  Okay, we're gonna have to reimagine your billboard campaigns around town, because you're standing right next to him. 
  So it doesn't matter that I believe he's innocent? 
  We have to think about the bigger picture. 
  You're just worried about the election. 
  - I am worried about the election. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  She's worried about the election, and you should be worried about the election, too, because the election is right around the corner. 
  And remember, when you're mayor, you're gonna be in a much better position to help this kid. 
  - That could be too late. 
  - No, it won't be too late. 
  This is a double murder case. 
  They take months, sometimes years to sort out. 
  Okay? 
  She knows I'm right. 
  Distance yourself from the kid. 
  Focus on the campaign. 
  Then we can do so much more. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  For Julio or for you? 
  For all three of us. 
  Even Dr. 
  Small Talk over here. 
  She's my favorite. 
  She loves me, by the way. 
  How was everything? 
  Ryan, that wine was f*cking divine. 
  What was that again? 
  The Sancerre Clos la Neore, 2005. 
  The Sance-hulu-what? 
  Come here, come here. 
  Um, would you do me a favor and, like, sneak a case of that for me? 
  I'll pay for it, you hide it away teamwork. 
  - Sounds good. 
  - Thank you, my friend. 
  Let me get these plates out of your way. 
  I love this guy. 
  Ryan, I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry, but I've never noticed before how did you lose your finger? 
  No, no, no, don't be embarrassed, no, no. 
  Imperfections are what make us beautiful. 
  - We need to run. 
  Yeah. 
  - Ah, yes. 
  They're busy, busy. 
  She's gonna be the next mayor of Los Angeles, Marisol Silva. 
  I'm very aware, Mr. 
  Wyatt. 
  I'm a big fan. 
  Hey, hey, cut the "Mr. 
  Wyatt" sh1t, please. 
  Sorry. 
  Tom. 
  And you have my vote, Ms. 
  Silva. 
  Thank you, Ryan. 
  Thank you again, Tom. 
  Hey, I'm always here for you guys. 
  It is always a pleasure. 
  And I'm always here for you, too, Ryan. 
  Thanks, Mr. 
  Wyatt. 
  Tom. 
  SÃ­. 
  Excuse me, sir. 
  You said you wanted to know right away. 
  I talked to Tom Wyatt. 
  He said everything is under control. 
  I get nervous with speaking in front of people. 
  Oh, hell, don't worry about it. 
  Everybody gets nervous doing this mess. 
  You're not alone. 
  Public defender's just gonna ask you some questions. 
  Just remember what we went over. 
  You're good. 
  I was at home. 
  Uh, Julio was doing his homework in his room. 
  I heard him practicing cello. 
  Yeah, all that stuff. 
  Like, is there gonna be an audience? 
  No, this is just a preliminary hearing, so there'll be a judge and a court reporter, bailiff, that's it. 
  It's easy as pie, man. 
  You look very handsome. 
  Been a while since I had a real suit. 
  Just tell the truth as you know it, that's all. 
  And remember, you're doing this for your kids, so you'll be focused. 
  Don't worry. 
  You're a good man. 
  Ah, back at you, buddy. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Anytime. 
  I want to show the guys this. 
  They've never seen me in a suit. 
  You ought to go over there and bus a few tables in front of them in that. 
  See you later. 
  You know, I think I'm just gonna type up his statement, just so we have a record of it. 
  Yeah, well, that's a good idea. 
  Hey! 
  Call somebody! 
  Oscar? 
  Oscar, stay with me, buddy. 
  Okay? 
  They're on the way. 
  Got people on the way. 
  Just keep looking at me. 
  Look at me, Oscar, look at me. 
  Stay with me. 
  Stay with me. 
  It's okay. 
  It's all right, buddy. 
  Look me in the eye, okay? 
  Just keep looking me in the eye. 
  Stay with me. 
  They're on the way. 
  - It's all right. 
  Come on. 
  - Billy. 
  Billy! 
  - Stay back, now. 
  - Billy, what happened? 
  - Stay with me. 
  - No Look at me. 
  Look at me. 
  No. 
  It's okay, it's okay. 
  No
