  She literally takes the whole f*cking pan every day. 
  My arteries would literally explode. 
  Yeah, well, that's one way to go. 
  - Yeah. 
  - So, what's up? 
  These, uh, these NDAs,  
  - it-it's gonna be hard to get ahold  
  - Hey, McBride. 
  - How's it hanging? 
  - (CHUCKLES) Not bad, Rita. 
  - What, you having a little bacon? 
  - Yeah. 
  It's nice and hot. 
  Ha. 
  Only live once. 
  - BILLY: That's right. 
  - It's gonna be tough to get ahold of these NDAs, you know that? 
  That's why I got the best guy on the job. 
  Well, e-even if I do get my hands on the nondisclosures, uh, i-it's gonna be even tougher to break them. 
  - All I need to know is who. 
  - Well, a lot of tight-lipped, tight-ass cowboys here. 
  None of these ranchers are gonna talk. 
  Well, there's got to be at least a state water guy and an L. A. 
  water guy in the room. 
  Depends on who they are. 
  And what they have to lose. 
  - Yeah. 
  - So Well, I will give it my best shot. 
  I know you will. 
  Hey, listen, tell your friend Delores that she'll remain anonymous, all right? 
  Thank you. 
  I-I will. 
  - That's nice. 
  That's nice. 
  - Yeah, just tell her not to sweat it. 
  - Always good to see you, JT. 
  - Likewise, likewise. 
  Bye, Rita. 
  Hey, McBride.

  Yeah.

  (DOOR CHIMES) DIANA: There she is. 
  Patty? 
  Hi. 
  - It's Diana Blackwood. 
  - Hey. 
  Remember I said I could spot your car anywhere? 
  (CHUCKLES) Spotted your car. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - DIANA: I see you've already met - my son Anton. 
  - Right. 
  You looked great on the news this morning. 
  - Sorry? 
  - You-you looked (CLEARS THROAT) Sorry. 
  You-you looked great on the news this morning. 
  - Oh. 
  - Do you do a lot of on-camera work? 
  - I do not. 
  - Oh, well, you should. 
  - It suits you. 
  - I'm good. 
  Well I know you're going after my brother. 
  And even though it seems the two of us are very intertwined, I just thought it was important for you to know that I'm not Wade. 
  I, I'm more on the creative side of the business. 
  - Mm - And, honestly, I don't know the ins and outs of what he's done to survive this drought. 
  Well, Diana, Wade has done some pretty bad things. 
  Mm. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Regardless of my brother, I care about these people. 
  Uh, so do I. 
  Oh. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  You're gonna be an excellent mother. 
  I can tell. 
  You (EXHALES) 
  What? 
  You're a very, very compassionate person. 
  (LAUGHS) Um, so, anyway, I-I, um, I want to help you and the others as much as I can, so, um, feel free to come by the Blackwood Almond Company whenever you wish. 
  Any time, please. 
  Door's always open, okay? 
  Okay. 
  DIANA: It was a pleasure to meet you, Patty. 
  ANTON: Watch your toes. 
  - DIANA: Remember to eat healthy. 
  - No, this is not for me. 
  DIANA (SQUEALS): I'm so excited. 
  (HORN HONKS) 
  (COW MOOS) 
  (BIRD CAWING)  
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  
  - 17. 
  - No more bets. 
  Stephanie. 
  - Joe. 
  - (CHUCKLES) What are you doing in town? 
  Um, just here for a couple days. 
  - Hmm Oh - Mm - No broken bones? 
  - Oh, it was a sprain. 
  I'm fine. 
  Mm. 
  What are you up to? 
  Well, you know, work. 
  Keeping busy? 
  24/7. 
  Come to the house for dinner? 
  You know, I'd really like it if you did. 
  I know. 
  I'll text you. 
  I'm making your favorite. 
  Head cheese sandwiches. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  RITA: sh1t. 
  He knows we're talking about him. 
  What do you think he's afraid you'll tell me? 
  Come here. 
  Come here. 
  - He's a warlock. 
  - Oh, come on, Rita. 
  I'm serious. 
  It freaks me the f*ck out. 
  When he comes around, if I'm playing the slots, right? 
  I just gather up my change and I just move. 
  I get the f*ck out of there. 
  Yeah, he's pretty creepy, all right. 
  So Wait, are Come here. 
  Come here. 
  Somebody told me, and I can't tell you who, but somebody told me that Littlecrow he's an actual f*cking crow. 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  At night. 
  He flies around, watches everybody as they sleep, and in the morning, poof, turns himself back into a casino manager. 
  Like nothing even happened. 
  That's quite a trick. 
  (CHUCKLES): Dude, it's no trick. 
  You should steer clear of him. 
  All right? 
  You look into a mirror darkly, you will see dark, shadowy figures. 
  You'll end up like Alice in Wonderland, you know? 
  Nightmare of your own making. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  Excuse me, uh, is it unusual for Delores to be a no-show for lunch? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Uh, maybe she's sick? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, maybe. 
  MAN: Tall Grass Farms. 
  Yes, is Delores there, please? 
  Delores no longer works here. 
  Oh. 
  Do you know where she went? 
  I don't. 
  Was she fired? 
  Who is this? 
  Sir? 
  (ENGINE APPROACHING) 
  (DOOR OPENS)  
  Hey. 
  Hi. 
  You were right. 
  Oh. 
  How did you know today would be the day? 
  (EXHALES)  
  Just had a feeling. 
  I don't understand what those numbers mean. 
  You're not supposed to. 
  And, frankly, it's better if you don't. 
  Is my pops doing something wrong? 
  He's just doing what he's told. 
  I know he's a sneaky f*ck. 
  It's not about him. 
  And stop asking me about it. 
  (LAUGHS) Okay. 
  - (CLEARS THROAT)  
  - Well, how are you doing, then? 
  Stop worrying about me. 
  I'm the one who's supposed to be worried about you. 
  I promised your mother. 
  Right. 
  I know. 
  (EXHALES)  
  - (CHUCKLES)  
  - (STEPHANIE CLEARS THROAT)  
  Hey, you sticking around? 
  I'm headed back to L. 
  A. 
  Okay. 
  Well (CHUCKLES) 
  Don't be a stranger. 
  (DOOR CLOSES) 
  (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Son of a bitch. 
  f*ck! 
  (WATER RUNNING) Bobbi? 
  Diana. 
  Gene. 
  Hi. 
  Your front door was unlocked, so, I, um I broke into your house. 
  (CHUCKLING): Sorry. 
  Okay, no, that's fine. 
  I'm just I'm I was surprised. 
  Can we talk? 
  Sure. 
  To Bobbi. 
  To Bobbi. 
  Mmm I didn't see any of your Scribner wines over in your racks. 
  Do you not know what this past year has been like for some of us? 
  Yes, I I understand. 
  Do you? 
  'Cause I don't think you understand what your brother has done to me. 
  Uh I I don't, I don't know, Gene. 
  - Maybe I don't understand. 
  - No, you don't. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I know that nothing will ever compensate for your loss. 
  And this class action lawsuit you're pursuing, I get it. 
  But all your grief all your pain will be diffused into a faceless crowd. 
  They just want the money. 
  That's what it's about for them, money. 
  And they'll get a few bucks. 
  And you'll get a few bucks, and your lawyers will get the most bucks of all. 
  And when it's all over, when they have finished up, packed up, gone home, you will still be sitting here. 
  Living with her memory. 
  I just don't know what to do. 
  Oh, honey. 
  Bobbi wants you to find a way to move forward with your life. 
  And sometimes moving forward means leaving things behind. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) When are we starting, do you know? 
  Oh, just a few minutes. 
  I promise it's about to start. 
  Come on. 
  Where's Gene? 
  He's not here yet. 
  MAN: I'm out of here. 
  BILLY: Just give him a few more minutes. 
  PATTY: Well, we have to start. 
  I mean, look, see? 
  Look. 
  That fucker just left. 
  We have to get this going. 
  Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  (SIGHS) I'll just do it. 
  All right. 
  Let's do it. 
  We're doing it. 
  Could I have your attention, please? 
  First of all, we'd like to thank you guys for coming tonight. 
  Um, my name's Billy McBride. 
  This is my associate,  
  - Patty Solis-Papagian. 
  - Hi. 
  This is Brittany Gold. 
  Marva Jefferson. 
  Part of our team. 
  We're attorneys, and we're organizing the class action for the citizens of Blackwood County who don't have any water. 
  MAN: Um, yeah, when is our water coming back? 
  Well, we don't have that answer yet, sir. 
  - You don't know? 
  - Uh, not yet. 
  It's kind of early in the process. 
  But, uh, let me explain to you what's happening, okay? 
  The Blackwood County Water Board controls your water, right? 
  Well, during this drought, they've decided to give all your water to the farmers, so they can keep their businesses open. 
  - (ANGRY CHATTER) - This is bullshit. 
  That's what the class action is all about. 
  But, uh, we're very hopeful that, uh, we can win this thing and, uh, get your water back as soon as possible. 
  Um, water's great, but I'm a hundred grand in debt. 
  I-I'm putting in a new well, I'm upside down on my house, and I think my wife's leaving me, so I'm sorry to hear that. 
  I understand, sir. 
  I-I know it's tough. 
  But like I said, we're hopeful that we could get you guys a really good settlement, possibly in the millions, so  
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  
  Yes, ma'am? 
  Is it true you're suing Wade Blackwood? 
  Well, we're suing the Blackwood County Water Board. 
  Yeah, but Wade Blackwood is the president of the water board, so you'd be suing Wade Blackwood and each individual board member. 
  Roy Wheeler. 
  Warren Hebb. 
  Gerry Kernen. 
  - I'm sorry, who are you? 
  - Someone who knows most of the people here are employed by the Blackwood Almond Company and Tallgrass Farms, both owned by Wade Blackwood. 
  I'm just wondering if anybody's concerned about getting fired for suing their boss. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) A-Are we gonna have to sign our name to something? 
  I can't lose my job over this. 
  BILLY: I understand, I really do, but, uh, I mean, I-I can't speak to that-that kind of speculation. 
  But, uh, yes, if you're part of the suit, you would have to sign, yes. 
  So everyone here will be suing their boss unless they specifically drop out of the lawsuit? 
  (QUIET CHATTER)  
  - (CAMERA CLICKING)  
  - Hey, don't take my picture. 
  - You don't know me. 
  - Hold on. 
  Guys. 
  - Hold on. 
  Please? 
  - Excuse me. 
  - Please stay and hear the facts. 
  - Excuse me. 
  All right? 
  There's a whole presentation. 
  You're a lawyer, right? 
  Counsel for the Blackwood County Water Board. 
  Ah. 
  Okay. 
  I thought something was coming back to me. 
  PATTY: If you're a lawyer, then you know that this is a privileged attorney-client meeting, right? 
  You're saying all those people are your clients? 
  Yes. 
  No. 
  You know better. 
  No class action has been filed or certified, and I have every right to be here. 
  It's good to see you, Billy. 
  Yeah, you, too. 
  See you around. 
  Well, how did it go? 
  Just like you said it would. 
  Good night. 
  See? 
  You're a man of your word, I'll give you that. 
  Billy McBride is a drunken cockroach. 
  He's a bug to be smashed, and I have a shoe. 
  It just happens to be the perfect size to crush him to smithereens. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  We only need to win. 
  It's the only way to win. 
  Well, I'll leave that in your capable hands. 
  Thank you. 
  Let's get out of this shithole. 
  What is Soop, anyway? 
  It's an all-natural, nontoxic lifestyle brand. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  So expensive bullshit. 
  (CHUCKLES) What can I do for you? 
  I'm officially threatening you. 
  Jesus, Uncle Roy. 
  Here it is. 
  I know your dirty water-tunneling project has reached my f*cking property. 
  - It has? 
  - Oh, cut the sh1t. 
  If you don't stop I'm going to Billy McBride. 
  Simple as that. 
  Is that it? 
  That's it. 
  Okay. 
  Well, I hear you. 
  We have to be smart about how we do this. 
  So (SNIFFS) 
  Mm. 
  So I will talk to Littlecrow about stopping the tunneling project. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  We're on the same team, Uncle Roy. 
  Mm, we're not. 
  But I appreciate you patronizing me. 
  It's always been what you do best. 
  Ooh, take this one. 
  It's made with CBD oil. 
  Helps with stress. 
  Mm, no, thank you. 
  (SIGHS) Where is he? 
  In the tunnel. 
  Take me down, honey. 
  LITTLECROW: That looks good. 
  Keep it up. 
  DIANA: We need to clear out of here. 
  Aw, come on, we just hit water. 
  We're only as far as Wheeler's property. 
  Now, give us a couple weeks, and we'll be at your property. 
  Not for good. 
  Just for now. 
  Wheeler's become a bit of a problem. 
  Listen, you told me that everybody was on board. 
  Everybody was on board, but he got cold feet. 
  But it's nothing that a little black crow  
  - couldn't straighten out. 
  - (SIGHS) Just a touch. 
  All right, all right. 
  Listen, Wheeler and your brother have a game scheduled tonight. 
  Why the f*ck do you think I'm down here, Joe? 
  (CHUCKLES) Clear this out tonight. 
  (ENGINE TURNS OFF)  
  - Hey, Gene. 
  - Billy. 
  Thought I'd check on you. 
  We didn't see you at the meeting. 
  I don't want to be a part of this class action suit. 
  What do you mean? 
  Why not? 
  I just don't want to. 
  Well, you know, it's the best option we got. 
  Um I-I just don't think we can prove wrongful death, so Well, I don't want to do anything. 
  I want to just just let it go. 
  - You want to let it go? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Well, it's like you said, I mean, we got to think about what Bobbi would want. 
  What Bobbi would have wanted is if you just took this f*cking case in the first place before she died. 
  That's what she wanted. 
  She came to you as a friend! 
  Her dear friend, Billy, and you f*cking walked away! 
  Hang on a goddamn minute, okay? 
  I'm not a f*cking psychic, Gene. 
  - She trusted you! 
  - Okay? 
  I don't take every case  
  - that comes along. 
  - I trusted you. 
  I don't know a f*cking thing about water rights. 
  You're just after the f*cking money,  
  - this class action. 
  - It's the best I can do, Gene. 
  Tell yourself whatever you want. 
  The thing is, if you just, just took the f*cking case in the first place, she would still be alive! 
  (PANTING)

  He just doesn't want to go through with it. 
  f*ck! 
  All right, we're gonna have to find somebody to replace him. 
  Yeah, of course. 
  You got anybody on deck? 
  Maybe Violet, the chick who delivers water. 
  She might be up for it. 
  I don't know.

  Billy McBride? 
  What, are you following me? 
  Yeah. 
  You're looking into things involving the Blackwoods and Roy Wheeler, is that right? 
  Yeah, that's right. 
  I'm Stephanie Littlecrow, a friend of Roy Wheeler's. 
  He died last night. 
  Heart attack. 
  You serious? 
  I just saw him last night. 
  Roy was having me keep track of some numbers being delivered to Joe Littlecrow through roulette table bets at the casino. 
  What for? 
  He wouldn't tell me what the numbers meant, but Joe's my stepdad, and he's always up to some shady sh1t with Wade Blackwood. 
  So you close to Roy? 
  I'm sorry. 
  What are you doing out here? 
  Oh, uh, I ran into some drilling the other night, (LAUGHING): and I can't remember where it was, so I'm trying to find it again. 
  Drilling at night. 
  You should be looking at night. 
  (BILLY CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  Yeah, well, I got a lot of sh1t going on, you know? 
  Yeah, I know. 
  Oh, yeah, this map is bullshit. 
  Really? 
  But, um  
  - I'd look around there. 
  - Yeah? 
  Okay. 
  Appreciate that. 
  Sure. 
  What was your first name again? 
  Stephanie. 
  (ENGINE STARTS) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Uh, you can't park here. 
  I didn't see any signs. 
  Yeah, there's no signs posted. 
  And trust me, you can't park here. 
  I'll, uh, I'll move down the road a bit? 
  You actually can't park anywhere here in Blackwood County, any time, ever. 
  - Yeah. 
  Got you. 
  - Excellent. 
  (CHUCKLES) Have a great day. 
  - Yeah, you as well. 
  - (SNIFFS) I don't know if I want to do this. 
  Well, listen, if it helps, the lead plaintiff does get a larger share of the settlement if we win. 
  And obviously I'm not making any promises, but So I sue the Blackwoods and get more money? 
  Wait, you can't sue the Blackwoods. 
  Why not? 
  Diana Blackwood owns my restaurant. 
  So? 
  How do you think that looks? 
  My girlfriend suing my employer. 
  Diana will fire me. 
  - Come on, you don't know that. 
  - I have a kid. 
  - I can't afford to lose my job. 
  - Yeah, and I have a house I can't sell 'cause no water. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - We win some money, we can finally move to Fresno. 
  - It'll be good for both of us. 
  - If. 
  If we win. 
  You can't guarantee that, can you? 
  No, but I can guarantee we'll do our best. 
  Hey. 
  Gloria. 
  Look, I totally understand how you feel, okay? 
  But if you ever want to talk things through, just call the office. 
  That blond lawyer's not gonna tell me anything  
  - I don't already know. 
  - Then give me a call. 
  Right? 
  We can talk. 
  What're you thinking? 
  I don't know. 
  You love this town, right? 
  There is nobody who could represent the problem here better than you. 
  Okay. 
  I'll be your whatever you called it. 
  Lead plaintiff. 
  She'll come around. 
  Good. 
  (WIND WHISTLING) Hey! 
  Can I help you find something? 
  I don't know what I'm looking for. 
  Huh. 
  Well, you're here for something. 
  Oh, I just can't quit thinking about Roy saying I'm looking in the wrong direction, I guess. 
  What, you think his ghost is gonna point you in the right one? 
  - I don't believe in ghosts. 
  - Well, I sure do. 
  Maybe that's just the guilt talking. 
  I got generations of guilt on my shoulders. 
  Is that why you're sitting here? 
  I'm sitting here because I lost my best friend. 
  He had a bad ticker. 
  And I can't a remember a time that he wasn't here. 
  Sorry about that. 
  Well, I appreciate that. 
  (SIGHS) Well, Billy, since you're here, look If I was to offer you a certain sum to settle this whole damn thing right now, do you think you'd take it? 
  Is that what Cooperman told you to do? 
  Nice move, by the way. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I have my moments. 
  (LAUGHING) 
  Cooperman. 
  Cooperman, ooh. 
  Wow. 
  That guy. 
  He really, really wants to nail your ass. 
  I don't know what you did to piss him off. 
  Yeah, you do. 
  (SIGHS) I'm tired. 
  How old are you, Billy? 
  - Younger than you. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  I mean, I could just have Cooperman's firm  
  - just reach out to you. 
  - There's no need to. 
  I mean, what's the point? 
  Why drag this all out? 
  We're both tired. 
  Oh, I can go all night. 
  Well if you feel that way about it, I guess I'm just gonna have to saddle up. 
  So go ahead and take a look around. 
  Don't you take nothing. 
  (COINS JANGLING)  
  Billy. 
  What's up? 
  I'm gonna take off for a while. 
  Say adios for now. 
  Why's that? 
  I think I screwed up, Billy. 
  I mean, I screwed up big time. 
  You know that really nice lady that got us the information  
  - from the water board? 
  - Yeah, Delores. 
  Yeah. 
  She's gone. 
  What do you mean gone? 
  She disappeared. 
  She f*cking vanished and, uh I think I'm responsible. 
  We're getting really close to something dangerous here. 
  Just be careful. 
  Yeah. 
  Nothing here is what it seems. 
  BLACKWOOD: I know that it would never be your intention to hurt anybody. 
  But if Roy died Wade, Wade, Wade, stop. 
  I loved Roy. 
  Mm. 
  Roy never understood us. 
  (DIANA CHUCKLES) 
  Nobody understands us. 
  Except us. 
  - If you did anything  
  - I didn't. 
  I didn't. 
  I didn't. 
  I didn't. 
  I wouldn't. 
  Roy was like my dad. 
  I know, hon. 
  I know. 
  And I don't want to lose you again. 
  No, no. 
  Never. 
  But I'm not afraid to. 
  So, this discussion, it ends right here. 
  We're gonna close the door on it. 
  Maybe you'd feel better after you take a bath. 
  Not tonight. 
  No. 
  (SIGHS) Hey. 
  Hey, hey. 
  Hey. 
  You want to go for a walk? 
  (COYOTE HOWLS)  
  (COYOTES BARKING AND HOWLING)  
  JANET: Can I have the, um, filet mignon a-and a and a chocolate milkshake? 
  Oh. 
  Okay. 
  Thank you. 
  Billy! 
  (CHUCKLES)  
  Hi. 
  What's going on? 
  What are you doing up here? 
  Oh, I-I'm just watching TV. 
  Bianca let me in. 
  Who's Bianca? 
  You know, Bianca from housekeeping. 
  So, anyway, um (CHUCKLES) Drumroll, please. 
  I wanted to show you that my check finally came from the IRS. 
  I bet you didn't know you could get a refund for burnt money. 
  No. 
  No, I didn't know that. 
  Well, that-that's great. 
  - Congratulations. 
  - Thanks. 
  This means I won't be hanging around the Ocean Lodge anymore,  
  - and-and I just came  
  - Oh, it's nothing. 
  To say thank you for being nice and giving me a place to stay. 
  (CHUCKLES) You're a good guy. 
  Sure, no sweat. 
  My pleasure. 
  Unless you want to go double or nothing  
  - on the roulette table. 
  - No, no. 
  Don't-don't go down that road. 
  You don't want to do that. 
  Just k-keep that and get back on your feet, okay? 
  Take care of yourself, will you? 
  Okay. 
  Pragmatic. 
  (CHUCKLES) Okay, so, then, I guess, um, I'll be Wait, I heard you ordering some food there,  
  - so, uh, maybe you can box it up. 
  - Oh, yeah, I did. 
  - Or you can wait for it. 
  - Oh, no, no, no, let's not box it. 
  Let's-let's stay and eat it. 
  - We'll-we'll share it. 
  - No, I don't, I don't really want anything. 
  (CHUCKLES): Okay. 
  So, how come you didn't, um, splurge for the suite again? 
  Well, they put me up here. 
  I didn't pick the room. 
  Well, they gave you the suite last time. 
  What last time? 
  You don't remember you and me were in this hotel before? 
  No, 'cause we weren't. 
  Billy, we've been here before. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  (ECHOING): We were in this room. 
  There was a party. 
  It was filled up with people. 
  (FADING): There were people making out
