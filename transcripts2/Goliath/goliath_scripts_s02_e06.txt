  She did everything by the book. 
  She was, she was clean.

  Is there anything I can do? 
  No. 
  No, I'm, uh I'm gonna Look, I'm, uh, just sit here for a while.

  So what kind of work do you do, Billy? 
  I'm a lawyer. 
  Oh, a lawyer. 
  That makes perfect sense. 
  How's that? 
  Well, troublemaker like Marisol could always use a good lawyer. 
  - Huh? 
  - Stop it. 
  Ah, she hates it when I tease her. 
  You should have told me you were having a party. 
  (SPEAKS SPANISH) 
  Are you thirsty, Billy? 
  - Yeah, I could use a drink. 
  - Yeah, please, this way. 
  - (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) 
  - (GABRIEL CHUCKLES) 
  Here in Mexico, we have a tradition of quinceaÃ±era, when a girl becomes a woman. 
  Do you have any children, Billy? 
  Yeah, I got a daughter. 
  She's amazing. 
  She's volunteering for my campaign. 
  If Marisol likes her, she must be very special. 
  Yeah, she's the center of my universe, all right. 
  - Gracias. 
  - Gracias. 
  Â¿Salud? 
  - (SPEAKS SPANISH) 
  - Okay. 
  - Oh, yeah, sorry about that. 
  - Mm. 
  - Here's to you. 
  Yeah.

  What's up, party people? 
  How is everyone? 
  - (CROWD CHEERING) 
  - Welcome! 
  How lovely that we are all here on this beautiful day because we are celebrating a very important day in the life of a woman. 
  Or in this case, women. 
  Because today we celebrate The QuinceaÃ±era. 
  Of Paz and Mercedes! 
  (CROWD CHEERING) 
  I speak for your parents, for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, And for myself,

  And now, Our gracious host and patron, Paz and Mercedes' esteemed godfather, Mr. Gabriel Ortega, will you do the honors? 
  (CROWD CHEERING) 
  Welcome to my home, everyone. 
  For me it is an honor to be the host of this great event and to be the godfather of these two beautiful princesses. 
  Today we recognize these girls as they become women. 
  If they are good women, their lives will be blessed by God. 
  Congratulations.

  (EXCITED CHATTER) 
  (LAUGHTER) 
  MARISOL (CHUCKLES): You're very stiff. 
  Well, of course I'm stiff. 
  I told you, I can't f*cking dance. 
  - Just-just go left and right. 
  - Yeah, okay. 
  - Like that? 
  - Yes, exactly. 
  - Okay, great. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  So was your childhood like this? 
  I mean, this is pretty ritzy, you know. 
  I thought you had humble beginnings. 
  I never had a quinceaÃ±era. 
  Yeah. 
  Why's that? 
  Because I went to the States before I turned 15. 
  Hmm. 
  Maybe they'll give you some kind of honorary  
  - diploma or something. 
  - No, thank you. 
  - Or whatever. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  I think it's a ridiculous tradition. 
  You know, girls dressed up like dolls because they became women. 
  I don't know. 
  They should want something better than that. 
  BILLY: Yeah, they'll figure it out. 
  - Just give them time. 
  - Ugh. 
  I don't want to be 15 again. 
  - Ugh. 
  I know that. 
  - Yeah, me either. 
  Wouldn't mind being 19 again, though. 
  You know? 
  (WOMAN SINGING IN SPANISH) 
  See, that's better than dancing, isn't it? 
  A little better. 
  So, I'm feeling kind of like I need to check in with Denise, but my cell phone won't work up here. 
  - Is there anyplace you can go that? 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  Yeah, we're in a very remote place, but there's a satellite phone in the billiard room. 
  - Yeah? 
  Yeah? 
  - Yeah, you can go if you want. 
  - They won't mind me using it? 
  - Mm-mm. 
  Yeah. 
  Oh. 
  Lipstick? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  You sure? 
  - Yeah, it's fine. 
  - Okay. 
  I'll be back in a minute. 
  (TRAFFIC PASSING) 
  ROMAN: How many cards do we have? 
  MARY: Okay, so you should have five cards. 
  And you want to keep anything that's a pair. 
  Or anything that's, like, really exciting. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - All right, I want four back, please. 
  Oh. 
  GIRL: Now I'm gonna put the top one that I had on top. 
  BOY: Four. 
  Uh, you guys Ooh, you're gonna kill me. 
  You're gonna kill me. 
  No. 
  - Did you beat that? 
  - (PHONE RINGING) 
  And I beat an eight. 
  You got to beat a queen. 
  You got to still beat a queen. 
  You still got to beat a queen. 
  - He's got to  
  - (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) 
  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  Hey. 
  LOOMIS: You somewhere you can talk? 
  Yeah. 
  What's up? 
  Think we're f*cked, Keith. 
  How do you mean? 
  Just heard someone's flipping. 
  Can't get ahold of Tom. 
  And what do you think we should do? 
  - You think it's Tom? 
  - It's got to be. 
  It's not you. 
  It's not me. 
  Not like Tom not to return my calls. 
  He's gonna f*ck us to save his own ass. 
  Yeah. 
  Sounds like something he'd do. 
  Look, um I can't do this over the phone. 
  Can we meet somewhere? 
  Just-just come up with a plan? 
  (MARY TALKING QUIETLY) 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it's a good idea. 
  We got to get out of this. 
  I'll text you where. 
  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  WYATT: What a f*cking prick. 
  Sounds like something I'd do? 
  f*ck that guy. 
  - I think he's onto us. 
  - (MUTTERS) 
 : He's onto us. 
  Yeah, I bet he knew I was listening. 
  He knew. 
  Is that really what's f*cking important right now? 
  Danny, I can tell you're stressed out, so I'm gonna let this one slide. 
  Do what you need to do. 
  Be a big boy about it. 
  (PHONE RINGING) 
  Hello. 
  BILLY: Hey, honey. 
  Oh, hey, Dad. 
  I'm not offended at all that you thought I needed a babysitter all weekend. 
  - BILLY: Yeah, whatever. 
  - Hi, Billy. 
  - Tell Brittany hey. 
  - He says hi. 
  - So how's your romantic getaway? 
  - Oh, it's all right so far. 
  - Wear a condom! 
  - Ew. 
  BILLY: Tell her, "Why start now? 
  Ruin my record " - Gross. 
  - Anyway, I don't have cell service down here, so I'm on this satellite phone. 
  Just in case you need something, I want to give you the number, all right? 
  - Now, you got a pen? 
  - Yeah, go ahead. 
  Okay. 
  Hang on. 
  - (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) 
  - (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  (CAMERA CLICKING) 
  (SHOUTING EXCITEDLY IN SPANISH) 
  (MAN SINGING IN SPANISH) 
  Are you enjoying your romantic getaway? 
  Why did you make me bring him here? 
  We needed to keep him away from Julio. 
  If that's your reason, I could have taken him anywhere. 
  Also, given his reputation, I wanted to meet him. 
  I expected someone with a little more with more personality, no? 
  I've made peace with Julio. 
  That was your choice. 
  But I care about Billy. 
  Give me your word that you will treat him well. 
  I don't appreciate how you flaunt him in front of me. 
  He's a good man, Gabriel. 
  And I need him. 
  For what? 
  For your campaign? 
  For many things. 
  Are you in love with him? 
  (GABRIEL SCOFFS) 
  You're a fool. 
  In love with a fantasy. 
  Do you think he would love you if he knew who you really are? 
  - Be nice. 
  - Or what? 
  Or I won't give you my city. 
  You've been away so long, you've turned into a gringa. 
  You forget who I am, Claudia. 
  Don't call me that. 
  f*ck did you find this place? 
  (LAUGHS) 
  (EXHALES) 
  So No one else is here. 
  I don't have my gun. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Okay. 
  Let's just get this over with. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  What are you talking about, man? 
  I know you know. 
  That's why I chose this spot. 
  Make it easier on you. 
  You won't get caught. 
  Mary gets a bigger payout if I'm dead. 
  Why the f*ck would you do this, man? 
  Oh, come on. 
  f*ck you, Danny. 
  - You put me in this position. 
  - No, no, no! 
  Don't give me  
  - that f*cking sh1t! 
  No, no, no! 
  - I had no choice. 
  You're a grown f*cking man! 
  You made your own f*cking decisions! 
  Do not pin this on me. 
  Why you? 
  Huh? 
  Why'd he send you? 
  I volunteered, you f*cking prick. 
  The f*ck you did. 
  You're too weak. 
  - Tom owns you. 
  - f*ck you. 
  - Tom didn't f*cking turn on me. 
  - Not yet. 
  You better hope you can pull that trigger. 
  You think I'm a pussy? 
  Huh? 
  - You don't think I can do it? 
  - I wish. 
  I want you to. 
  That way, Mary never finds out what the f*ck we've done. 
  And I don't have to rat out my best friend. 
  Just make sure nothing happens to her and the kids. 
  Okay? 
  That's the least you can do. 
  (PANTING) 
  I'm gonna turn around. 
  LOOMIS (WHISPERS): f*ck. 
  You help us both out. 
  (LOOMIS PANTING) 
  - (DOOR CLOSES) 
  - (ENGINE STARTS) 
  (VEHICLE DRIVES OFF) 
  Hey. 
  - Hey, you found me. 
  - Yeah, finally. 
  It's a big f*cking joint. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  My God, this bathrobe, I It was so big for me when I was little, but I loved it. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I loved feeling cozy in it. 
  BILLY: What's wrong? 
  Is that your diary? 
  You don't want me to see your baby diary, do you? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  No, it's just, uh It's a book my brother did for me. 
  Nice. 
  - It's our story. 
  - Really? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Oh, that's cool. 
  Hmm. 
  Well, looks like a pretty good little artist when he was a kid. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  Well, she fell down. 
  The hell is that? 
  That's a little dark for a kid to be drawing, isn't it? 
  My parents were murdered. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I, uh I was very little. 
  And I came here and lived with Gabriel's family. 
  They adopted me. 
  He became my brother and protected me. 
  I see. 
  Sorry, I didn't mean to make light of that. 
  I didn't, I didn't know. 
  - No. 
  - You know, you never said anything. 
  Just don't love to talk about it. 
  Yeah, I don't blame you. 
  Sorry. 
  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) 
  Hey. 
  Oh, you found the book. 
  You know, I made that for her before she left to America. 
  Yeah, she said. 
  She left it behind. 
  - I didn't leave it behind. 
  - You "forgot" it. 
  You forgot who you are. 
  No, I haven't forgotten. 
  Why do you care if it's here? 
  You know, Billy, um, Marisol and I, we used to share this bed as children. 
  She used to be scared of the dark. 
  - Yeah, I still am. 
  - GABRIEL: Mm. 
  We shared this bed you're gonna hate me for telling this story we shared this bed until the night Marisol got her first period. 
  - Okay. 
  We are done. 
  - She was freaking out because she thought she was dying, of course. 
  (LAUGHS): The blood coming out of her. 
  And then I was just in-in shock - because I didn't know what to do. 
  - MARISOL: Mm-hmm. 
  You were gonna show me the town, right? 
  Yes, let's go. 
  Let's go. 
  (MARISOL AND GABRIEL CONVERSING IN SPANISH) 
  Billy's a grown man, right? 
  Your brother's an interesting character. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Yeah, you are being polite. 
  No, it's just being home. 
  BILLY: Yeah. 
  I haven't been back to my home in Oh, God. 
  That was when I'll probably never go back. 
  You see the lazo? 
  That represents their everlasting union. 
  They're bound forever. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - Yup. 
  BILLY: Hey, buddy. 
  I'll distract her. 
  You-you make a run for it, all right? 
  - Gracias, gracias. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  - Billy. 
  Don't ruin their wedding day. 
  - What? 
  Well, he didn't know what I was talking about, anyway. 
  (MARISOL LAUGHS) 
  (GRUNTS SOFTLY) 
  (PANTING) 
  (GRUNTING) 
  (PHONE BEEPS) 
  It's taken care of. 
  All of them. 
  No, I did it. 
  (BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE) 
  Hey, you know the sister over there? 
  I think so. 
  Do you pray? 
  Oh, God, no. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  No, I-I wish. 
  I don't pray. 
  So Why don't I just wait outside for you, okay? 
  - (SOFTLY): Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Take your time. 
  It's good to see you, Sister. 
  You are not welcome in the house of God. 
  Get out of here! 
  You disgrace me! 
  Get out! 
  See? 
  That's what I'm saying. 
  They're trying to f*ck me up with a confidential warrant for some weed? 
  M*therf*ckers are getting licenses to sell this sh1t. 
  - I've got a weed card. 
  - Dude, you asked me to get JT here, and he's here, so chill. 
  Let him do - his work, okay? 
  - Yeah, I wanted him because he helped my cousin and he knows what the f*ck he's doing. 
  - I don't know you. 
  - All right, if you don't need me here, - then whatever. 
  - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
  I apologize, okay? 
  I respect you. 
  Give him the f*cking phone. 
  I'm listening. 
  How does this snitch sh1t work? 
  'Cause I heard about some sh1t that's going down. 
  Not here, but I know where. 
  Some kid. 
  Could I get a deal for that? 
  That depends. 
  Let's hear what you got. 
  - BILLY: A plantano? 
  - MARISOL: A plÃ¡tano. 
  - That's a banana, isn't it? 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - Yeah? 
  - You're picking up a lot of Spanish here very quickly. 
  BILLY: Well, now, that one I heard before. 
  We used to make jokes about that one. 
  - MARISOL: About plÃ¡tanos? 
  (LAUGHS) 
  - Yeah. 
  I-I had a friend from - SeÃ±ora Silva. 
  - Yes? 
  (CONVERSING IN SPANISH) 
  - The campaign. 
  - Oh. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - I hope it's good news. 
  I hope so. 
  It might take a while. 
  - That's all right. 
  Take your time. 
  - Good. 
  (DOOR CLOSES) 
  - Hey, Billy. 
  - Hey, what's up? 
  - You like the town? 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  I didn't get to see much, but yeah, sure. 
  - Yeah, it's a nice town. 
  - Yeah. 
  They're very poor, but, um good people. 
  Yeah, I'm sure. 
  Do you know what I do, Billy? 
  To tell you the truth, she didn't tell me about you. 
  Really? 
  Oh, that's strange. 
  We're very close, you know. 
  Well, she's, uh, she's a little secretive. 
  She tends to keep things under her hat, you know? 
  Mm. 
  Would you like me to show you around the property? 
  Yeah, sure. 
  Ah, let's go. 
  Please, after you. 
  Thanks. 
  GABRIEL: Ah, look at this. 
  Very bad year for the Cabernet grapes. 
  You know much about wine, Billy? 
  No, I don't know sh1t about wine. 
  Ah, you're more of a bourbon man, huh? 
  - Yeah, exactly. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
 
 
 
  - I respect that. 
  Oh, please, don't-don't mind them. 
  So, look, I got a question about Marisol. 
  Okay. 
  What happened to her parents? 
  Ah, it's very sad. 
  Her parents owed money to the cartel, and they couldn't pay, so they paid with their lives. 
  - Which cartel? 
  - Oh, they're long gone. 
  It's a very peaceful town now. 
  (CHUCKLES): Yeah, I can see. 
  Pretty good at keeping the peace there. 
  - Well, some people want what I have. 
  - Yeah. 
  (CONVERSING IN SPANISH) 
  Billy. 
  Billy, Eduardo. 
  - How you doing? 
  - Hola. 
  Eduardo's been working for the family for a very long time. 
  - SÃ­, sÃ­. 
  - Uh, he's a very loyal man. 
  (CONVERSING IN SPANISH) 
  I'm also a surgeon, Billy. 
  (SPEAKS SPANISH) 
  No. 
  No. 
  No, no, no. 
  (CONVERSING IN SPANISH) 
  Yeah, nice to meet you. 
  You're the first hobby surgeon I ever met. 
  Ah, it's a poor town. 
  I'm the only surgeon around. 
  Feel like, uh, like it's my duty, you know? 
  - Hmm. 
  - Would you like to see my operation room? 
  It's, uh, very state-of-the-art. 
  Uh - things like that kind of creep me out. 
  - Hmm. 
  I probably better get back to the gal. 
  - She's a complicated woman. 
  - (VEHICLE APPROACHES) 
  Yeah. 
  She ain't your average bear. 
  I think, Billy, you're in a honeymoon phase with her. 
  She's not a woman who can be controlled, you know. 
  You ever met one that could be? 
  What exactly are your intentions with my sister? 
  My intentions? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Well, not that it's anybody's business, but I don't have any specific intentions. 
  I just kind of watch and wait. 
  She's grown. 
  So am I. 
  Thanks for the tour. 
  Of course. 
  They're not gonna shoot me, are they? 
  (CHUCKLES): No. 
  No. 
  Please. 
  - All right. 
  - I'm not a monster. 
  (BILLY CHUCKLES) 
  (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER) 
  - Step. 
  - Yeah, watch out. 
  All right. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  All right, I'll be there in a second. 
  - Give me a minute. 
  - PATTY: Hey.

  What about the kids? 
  Jesus Christ. 
  Wha What about the cop that was watching him? 
  They got to him, too. 
  I mean, how does this f*cking happen? 
  Someone knew what they were doing. 
  That's how this f*cking happens. 
  So what does this mean for Julio now? 
  HAKEEM: I'm gonna run it by the D. A. 
  No promises, but I'm gonna recommend we drop the charges. 
  Yeah, but we don't have Roman's testimony Yes, I heard enough to know that the kid didn't kill anyone. 
  But whatever this is, it's beyond Julio. 
  Excuse me. 
  Yeah? 
  Hey. 
  Just tell me, was this the cartel? 
  We don't know for sure. 
  But if it is the cartel and I'm speculating but if What do you mean you're speculating?

  And my life is not perfect.
