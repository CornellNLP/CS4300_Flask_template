 Joy! 
 ‐ How long have they been going out? 
 Long enough for Lexie to have their wedding planned. 
 ‐ I'm going to Yale. ‐ Congratulations. 
 ‐ She hasn't even applied yet. 
 ‐ Oh, so you want to change your math class. 
 They try to discourage minorities from taking advanced courses. 
 I think I figured out what I'm gonna do for my Yale essay. 
 ‐ If you don't stand up for yourself, who will? 
 I'd like to help you in your household if the offer still stands. 
 ‐ Sure. 
 ‐ Hon, look, you're allowed to change your mind if you don't want her there. 
 ‐ I did lie. I put down a fake reference. 
 But I'm not a criminal. 
 ‐ Why don't we have a glass of wine? 
 ‐ What's going on with her? 
 I had a daughter. 
 ‐ What was her name? 
 ‐ May Ling. 
 ‐ You're 70 cents short. 
 ‐ Please, she not eat for days. I not eat for week. 
 ‐ Then try breastfeeding. It's free. 
 ‐ Please. ‐ Get the f*ck out of my store! 
 ‐ We're closed. 
 ‐ Is, uh...is Scott around? 
 I'm...here to hit the slopes. 
 Try the kitchen. 
 ‐ How can he not get caught? ‐ God only knows. 
 ‐ Maybe because his face. He's dumb but cute. 
 ‐ More dumb than cute. 
 Beef and broccoli and fried rice. 
 And you take the egg rolls because I took them all for Pearl last night. 
 ‐ Pearl? Is that your daughter's name? 
 It's beautiful. ‐ Thank you. 
 So is May Ling. 
 ‐ Sometimes...I still hear her cry. 
 ‐ Of course you do. Because you're her mother. 
 ‐ She gone. 
 I'm not her mother anymore. 
 ‐ Bebe, a mother is a mother, and you will always be hers. 
 ‐ I leave her. I do that. 
 It doesn't matter what I want. ‐ No, it does. 
 It matters. May Ling is out there. 
 And if you want her, you have to find her. Whatever it takes. 
 ‐ Find her? You think it's so easy? 
 You think I'm not trying my best to find her? 
 I'm illegal. 
 If I go to police station, they'll send me back. 
 ‐ Hey, hey. Uh, I didn't finish A Separate Peace. 
 What happens? 
 ‐ Um, Finny's in the tree, and Gene shakes the branch. 
 What do you think? 
 ‐ Decent penmanship. 
 Is it still penmanship when it's done with a paintbrush? 
 ‐ Uh‐‐ ‐ Paintbrushmanship? 
 ‐ I meant about going. 
 ‐ I think I would rather finally watch Before Sunrise like we planned. 
 It's been weeks. 
 So, uh, what happens next? 
 ‐ Um, Finny falls and breaks his leg. 
 When that counselor discouraged me from taking a harder math class, I found myself angry and confused. 
 Our conversation took less than a minute, the same amount of time it took for that metaphorical glass ceiling to form right above my head. 
 ‐ Mm. ‐ His sexism was telling me loud and clear. 
 That I would never go as far as my male classmates. 
 Sexist discrimination is more than a hardship. 
 It's the pervasive reality of being a woman. 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ And it's a reality I'm striving to change as we move into the twenty‐first century. 
 ‐ Mm. ‐ As our first lady said, we as women can do more than sit home and bake cookies. 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ Glass ceilings are glass because they are made to be shattered. 
 Well? What do you think? 
 ‐ Um, yeah, it was‐it was good. 
 I, I didn't know that happened to you, so... 
 Are, are we, are we still doing... 
 ‐ Okay, well, why would I have written it if it didn't happen? 
 ‐ Guess not. 
 I don't know, I guess I just figured you would have...said something. 
 ‐ What, to get second guessed for my experience? 
 ‐ Why are you getting so mad? ‐ Is this even about my essay? 
 Is this about s*x? 
 ‐ What are you...no. 
 No. 
 But prom and Homecoming are basically the same thing, so... 
 ‐ Okay, they are completely different. When did Brenda and Dylan have s*x? 
 It was prom night, Brian. 
 ‐ Um, no, actually, it wasn't. It was the spring dance. 
 ‐ The spring dance and prom are the same thing. 
 They just couldn't say that because they were juniors twice. 
 ‐ Which is exactly why we shouldn't use them as our sexual touchstone. 
 That show is stupid, anyway. It doesn't make any sense. 
 Where's your faceplate? 
 I was very clear when I ordered these cookies, 27 days ago, that I needed them Friday and tomorrow is Friday. 
 Trip, get off the line. I'm on the phone. 
 Sorry, Mom. You could try a different kind of cookie. 
 ‐ No, a different kind of cookie is not gonna work. 
 You can't put a tiny message in a different cookie. 
 Bev. Can you hang on a sec? 
 ‐ Okay, yes, fine, I'll hold. ‐ I'm home. 
 ‐ Hi, honey. 
 There's a problem with the cookies. 
 ‐ What cookies? ‐ The ones I've been talking about for literally a month. 
 The ones for Mirabelle's birthday party. Dinner, everybody. 
 ‐ We got a fine at Windsor. ‐ What? 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. She let the grass grow over six inches. 
 ‐ Uh, is it all right if Pearl stays for dinner? 
 Yes, of course, as long as it's okay with her mother. 
 Is it fine with your mom? ‐ I'm sure it's fine, yeah. 
 ‐ Okay, great. Can we talk about this later? 
 Uh, Moody, will you take the rolls and put them on the table and also set? 
 Are you still there? ‐ Yes, I'm still holding Bev. 
 Mm‐hmm. ‐ Okay, yeah. 
 Hi. ‐ Mm‐hmm. 
 ‐ She agreed to follow the ordinances when she moved in. 
 ‐ Oh, great. That's so great to hear that. 
 You're a lifesaver. All right, thank you, honey. Bye. 
 Moody, don't forget the cloth napkins. 
 ‐ Hon. ‐ Yes, it's my fault. 
 She asked for gas for the mower and I just completely forgot. 
 ‐ Okay, but you're normally the one who's out there with a ruler. 
 ‐ I know, but she works three jobs and she made our dinner. 
 How about you mow the lawn? 
 Moody, don't forget the forks are on the left. 
 ‐ I don't feel like you're really hearing me here. 
 ‐ ‐ Look who's here, finally. 
 Oh, my goodness, Brian! 
 How are you? It has been so long. 
 Why is it so hard to get you to this house? 
 ‐ Thanks for having me, Mrs. Richardson. 
 ‐ Always. Okay, Moody, make sure everybody has a drink. 
 We have strawberry, kiwi, and diet peach Snapple. 
 And Lexie, get your brother and sister. I don't know what's taking them so long. 
 Yo, dinner. 
 ‐ Uh, hey. ‐ Hi, I'm Pearl. 
 ‐ Oh, you two don't know each other? No. 
 ‐ Oh, you're gonna love each other. I'm sure you have so much in common. 
 ‐ No way. You must like rap and basketball too, huh? 
 It's called the Million Woman March. 
 I just think that that should be for all women. 
 Like the Million Man March. 
 ‐ Yeah, but that was actually just black men. 
 Yo, can I get a roll? 
 Dude, don't be a little bitch, bro. ‐ Hey, Trip. 
 Give me the rolls. ‐ He just said bitch. 
 ‐ Moody, I don't like that language. I just think that there should be a march for everyone. 
 Otherwise, it's outdated and sexist. 
 ‐ Mm, sexist. Your favorite word. 
 ‐ Like the March on Washington. Right, Mom? 
 You said that was for everyone. ‐ It was amazing. 
 Young, old, white, African‐American. 
 Religious leaders, activists, union members. 
 Just a beautiful blend of people. Including Dr. King, of course. 
 I remember being a child and even at that moment, I knew it was monumental. 
 It really was a dream. It was. 
 It's like the Minority Achievement Committee. 
 Right, like, I of course support minorities achieving, and yet, I can't go to any of those meetings. 
 ‐ Well, the group is kind of about, you know, black students supporting each other, so... 
 ‐ You think? ‐ You know, no one's talking to you, Izzy. 
 ‐ Yeah, no one wants to hear you talk, Lexie. 
 ‐ Okay, you two, please don't start. Brian, I noticed a real need for that at the school when I was dealing with Pearl and her counselor. 
 ‐ Wait, what, what happened with the counselor? 
 ‐ He was a jerk. ‐ Yeah. 
 Mr. Bowers wouldn't let Pearl switch to Algebra 2. 
 But Elaine helped. She fixed it, so I'm really grateful for that. 
 ‐ What about Lilith Fair? Is that sexist? 
 ‐ What is Lilith Fair? ‐ It's your worst nightmare. 
 Trip. ‐ No wonder they call you "Ellen." 
 Trip Richardson! I said enough! 
 ‐ I'm sorry, why do they call your sister "Ellen"? 
 ‐ Like DeGeneres, Mom. 
 ‐ Because she's funny? 
 ‐ No. 
 Um, it was last winter. Um, she was a young mother. 
 The baby was‐‐ is Chinese. Just a couple months old. 
 She has a tiny red dot on her scalp. 
 ‐ It wasn't this station, but yeah, I heard about it. 
 ‐ So if I wanted to know where the baby ended up... 
 ‐ I'd try the police. 
 ‐ Right. If, um, is there anybody else I, I could also talk to? 
 Just to be vigilant. ‐ Only the police. 
 They're your best bet if you want to find that baby. 
 ‐ Okay, thanks. ‐ Good luck. 
 ‐ Uh‐huh. 
 ‐ You didn't have to drive me. ‐ Oh, no, it was easy. 
 I was running errands on this side of town anyway. 
 But I don't know how I'm gonna get it all done before Saturday. 
 ‐ Right. It's essential a one‐year‐old have a night to not remember. 
 ‐ You could help me if you're available. I, I could use the extra set of hands. 
 Although, maybe you're going to Homecoming or‐‐ 
 ‐ I'm not, Mom. 
 ‐ You know, you don't have to go with a date. 
 You could go with a group of girlfriends. 
 What about April? ‐ Mom. 
 ‐ What, I... 
 Is she the one calling you names at school? 
 I remember when I was in 7th grade and Linda got boobs. 
 And I was concave. 
 And all the boys were flirting with her and snapping her bra, and I didn't have boobs, so... you know what I did? 
 ‐ You walked the halls without being harassed and groped? 
 ‐ I padded my bra, little by little, until my boobs came in. 
 ‐ So you overcame your shame of being flat by living a lie? 
 ‐ Well, no, I shaped the story that I wanted to tell, literally. 
 Come to think of it, it was probably my, my first experience as a journalist. 
 ‐ This is the worst story I've ever heard. 
 ‐ Everybody's telling a story, Isabelle. Whether they admit it or not. 
 You shouldn't let those girls write a story for you. 
 If they're saying something untrue, then you should change the story. 
 Are they saying something untrue? 
 ‐ Of course it's untrue. ‐ Okay. 
 Well then, then you should change the story. 
 How you doing out there, Cardinals? 
 Brian, I 911'd you and I 143'd last night. 
 Where were you? 
 Is this still about the stupid essay? 
 Okay, why do you care so much about some girl that you met once? 
 ‐ I don't. ‐ You don't. 
 ‐ No, it's not about Pearl. 
 What you did, that, that's f*cked up, Lexie. 
 And if you can't see that, then... 
 ‐ Then what? 
 ‐ I don't know. 
 Whoo, looking good, ladies. Real good. 
 Give it up for our cheer squad! 
 ‐ We're like trained seals. ‐ Who? 
 ‐ Mankind. Some so‐called authority says clap, and we clap. 
 The moment you've all been waiting for... 
 Our 1997‐‐ ‐ I was thinking about going. 
 To Homecoming. 
 ‐ With who? ‐ I don't know. 
 Friends? You guys, maybe? 
 Erin Flood and William Richardson! 
 ‐ Yeah. Yeah, I mean, if you, if you need people to go with, we could, like, all go together. 
 And we don't really have to be into it. It can be more of like a... like a social experiment. We could be like anthropologists. 
 ‐ High school dances don't need anthropologists. 
 They're their own genre. 
 You've seen Sixteen Candles and Carrie, right? 
 ‐ Yeah. ‐ And trust me. 
 Before Sunrise, way better. 
 ‐ What if you guys do both? The dance and then the movie? 
 ‐ Yeah. Yeah, I mean, we could. 
 And if you're still up to it, we could all go together. 
 ‐ Fine, I'll go. 
 But if they play that f*cking Sugar Ray song, I'm out. 
 Kristen Braun and Jamie Sheridan! ‐ Then I'm in. 
 ‐ And finally, she has a perfect 4.0 and came in third in the Ohio state monologue competition for her moving rendition of Butterflies Are Free, and he is a three‐sport athlete and our quarterback, our king and queen, Alexandra Richardson and Brian Harlins! 
 ‐ Hey. ‐ Hey. 
 ‐ So, your lawn's done, and I filled up the mower. so the tank is ready to go for next time. 
 ‐ Thanks. 
 ‐ Who shot that? 
 ‐ I did. ‐ Really? 
 That's, uh... 
 huh. 
 ‐ You're a lawyer. 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. 
 ‐ Are there any immigration lawyers at your firm? 
 ‐ No, not at my firm. But I know some good guys downtown. 
 Why? ‐ Do you know anyone who would work pro bono? 
 ‐ No. The guys I know are pretty pricey, and they definitely don't work for free, sorry. 
 ‐ Okay. 
 ‐ What do you think today? Springer or Ricki? 
 ‐ We could do something crazy and watch Oprah. 
 ‐ I would love to, but I kind of got to go find a dress for Homecoming. 
 ‐ You can borrow something. Do you know how much frilly sh1t I have in my closet I've never worn? 
 ‐ Okay. ‐ Wait, so you need a dress? 
 We should go shopping. Oh, um, yeah, we should. 
 Oh, wait, you meant like, right now? ‐ Yeah. 
 ‐ Oh, uh, Moody, is that okay with you? 
 ‐ Yeah, sure. 
 ‐ All right. ‐ I'm parked in the Oval. Let's go. 
 ‐ Oh, um, well, bye, guys. 
 ‐ See you. 
 ‐ So the balloons, we’re gonna pick them up tomorrow. 
 The catering is set. 
 Oh, you did a great job on the centerpieces. Thank you. 
 ‐ Oh, thank you. ‐ Thank you. 
 I wish I could steal you tomorrow night. 
 ‐ Well, takeout duty calls. 
 ‐ Uh, did you see the fortune cookie party favors? 
 ‐ Yeah. ‐ You should take some for Pearl. 
 ‐ Oh, no, thank you. We, we have plenty. 
 It's a perk of the job. ‐ Oh, of course. 
 Now, your paper roses look perfect and mine look like wadded up pieces of trash. 
 ‐ If this is what happens when she turns one, what are you gonna do at 16? 
 ‐ Well, this isn't a typical one‐year‐old birthday party with other one‐year‐olds. 
 I mean, it's sort of been a process for Linda and Mark. 
 They tried for so long to get pregnant. Decades, even. 
 And all of their friends had kids in their 20's like me and it was just heartbreak after heartbreak for her. 
 She always showed up for me. When Lexie was born, she was there. 
 When Trip was born, she was there. 
 At every birthday party. She threw me four baby showers. 
 She even watched them when I couldn't. 
 So all of this is really just a celebration for her and‐and Mark as parents. 
 You know, because Mirabelle, that all happened so quickly, and you know, there was no time to plan a shower. 
 Obviously, they weren't there at the birth, so... 
 ‐ What‐what do you mean? 
 ‐ Oh, haven't you met Mirabelle? ‐ No. 
 ‐ Oh, I just assumed. Um, the McCulloughs adopted her. 
 ‐ Ah, I had no idea. 
 ‐ Oh, it's actually an incredible story. I thought about pitching it to People. 
 So Linda and Mark had all but given up hope. 
 And then, they got a call that there was a two‐month‐old baby girl found starving, just left out, in the dead of winter, alone, outside a fire station in... it was Cleveland, I think. 
 It was Cleveland. ‐ Um, um, what? 
 ‐ A fire station. 
 I know. Who does that? 
 I mean, if you can't handle being a mom, then don't get pregnant. 
 ‐ Hey. ‐ You know? 
 Hey, honey. ‐ Hey. 
 Um, so the, the fortune cookies. Are those because she is... 
 ‐ Chinese. It's clever, isn't it? 
 ‐ Oh, I'm going to Homecoming. ‐ What? With who? 
 ‐ Friends. 
 ‐ We had a conversation and she actually listened to me. 
 One for the books. 
 ‐ Um, Elena, I just‐I just noticed the‐ the time. 
 And I have to get home to Pearl, so... 
 ‐ Well, thank you for everything. ‐ Yeah. 
 ‐ Uh, are you okay? 
 ‐ Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm fine. 
 So this is fun. Us hanging out. 
 ‐ Yeah, totally. 
 ‐ We haven't really done anything outside of Ricki Lake and Real World, you know? 
 But I guess that's kind of the cool thing about the Shaker Heights kids. 
 You know, we all hang out with everyone. 
 It's not as clique‐y as some of the other schools, you know? 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. 
 ‐ Which is why the, um... the math class thing was so f*cked up. 
 ‐ It was no big deal. 
 Really. ‐ But hard, you know? 
 Like a hardship. 
 Um, you know, your story actually inspired the essay I wrote for Yale. 
 ‐ It did? ‐ Totally. 
 I mean, whether you're black or a girl, or, like, both, when something like that happens to one of us, it's like it happens to all of us, you know? 
 Oh, my God. Pearl, you're getting it. 
 ‐ I can't. It's way too much. 
 ‐ Uh, you can, because I'm paying for it. 
 ‐ No, Lexie, I can't let you do that. ‐ Uh, yes. 
 You would look way better in this than I ever would. 
 Doesn't surprise me. You are so pretty. 
 ‐ Thank you. ‐ So is your mom. 
 She's got, like, this Denise from Cosby vibe. 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. 
 ‐ And your dad. Is he, is he mixed? 
 Because you look so mixed to me. 
 ‐ Um...maybe. I don't really know. I've never met him. 
 ‐ But you've seen, like, a photo of him, right? 
 ‐ No. I, um...I should probably... 
 Well, you know, I once told Brian that I was sure someone in his family was white, because of his mom's hair, you know? 
 And then he got super offended. 
 But it turns out that his grandma’s actually half‐Italian, so he had to apologize because I was totally right. 
 So, I'm telling you, you're‐you’re mixed with something. Ask your mom. 
 ‐ Hey, baby. 
 ‐ Are you okay? What happened? 
 What happened? 
 ‐ What's that? 
 ‐ Oh, I, um...I'm going to Homecoming with Moody and some friends. 
 ‐ What's in the bag? ‐ A dress. 
 ‐ Can I see it? 
 ‐ I mean, it's nothing. It was on sale. 
 And I didn't even buy it. The store was, like, practically giving them away. 
 ‐ This is your thing now? Lying to me? 
 Who bought this for you? 
 ‐ Lexie. 
 As a thank you for something that I helped her with. 
 Mom, it's not even a big deal. ‐ No, you're gonna return it to her. 
 We'll find you something at Goodwill. ‐ What, no. 
 If I buy something from Goodwill, I might as well just wear a paper bag from Weinen's. 
 I'm not taking that back. 
 ‐ You're letting some rich spoiled white girl turn you into her dress up doll. ‐ No, I'm not. 
 ‐ She doesn't own you. You don't belong to Lexie Richardson. 
 ‐ Why are you working in their house? 
 ‐ You know why. 
 For some extra spending money. 
 ‐ No, see, Mom, you could have worked anywhere. 
 You want me to be honest? You be. 
 I want to know about where I came from. Like about your parents. 
 ‐ You know about my parents. ‐ Besides the fact that you don't speak. 
 And what about my dad? 
 Huh? 
 Can I at least know about him? 
 ‐ I told you, he is the person who gave me you. 
 ‐ That's not an answer. 
 What does he look like? Is he black? 
 Is he white? Is he dead? Is he an alien? 
 ‐ Where is this coming from? ‐ I don't even know what my own father looks like, Mom. ‐ Why does it matter? He's... 
 I'm black. You're black. 
 You're mine. You came from me. 
 ‐ Why won't you tell me? 
 Why can't I know? ‐ Because it doesn't matter. 
 ‐ No, but it does matter. ‐ It does not matter. 
 ‐ It matters to me. ‐ Pearl, it doesn't matter! 
 ‐ What if he could help us? 
 ‐ Do what? ‐ I don't know. 
 Buy a house. 
 Not have to shop at Goodwill. 
 Have a better life. 
 ‐ You wanted a bike. ‐ Mom. 
 ‐ I made you a bike. ‐ Mom, I don't‐‐ 
 ‐ You wanted more than one wall. I gave you four walls. 
 ‐ Mom, I didn't mean it like that. ‐ You know what, Pearl? Just wear the damn dress. 
 ‐ No, he’s not gonna wear f*cking Tevas to Homecoming. He’s got a hook toe. 
 Will you call Jim? He's being a total douchebag to Serena. 
 ‐ Jim is a douchebag. He makes f*cking dad jokes. 
 ‐ Okay. Look I'm handling it. I'm just going to... 
 ‐ Dude, how many times are you gonna rent that movie? 
 I didn't know Carl liked roses. ‐ They're not for Carl, dick. 
 Calm down. It'll all be okay. 
 It's Mirabelle Rose. Do they even look like roses? 
 Nope. ‐ They're not even pink. They're beige. 
 Who doesn't know to make the stems green? They look like body parts. 
 I'm having book club flashbacks. 
 Oh, my goodness, Pearl. You look so pretty. 
 Moody's inside, so go on in. ‐ Thanks, Elena. 
 ‐ Mrs. Richardson. ‐ Oh, Mrs. Richardson is my mother‐in‐law. 
 ‐ Oh. Well, I just want her to be respectful. 
 Of course. ‐ Yeah. 
 Bill, will you let Mia help you, please? 
 ‐ What? No, no, I'm good. I got it, I got it. 
 Okay. ‐ Okay. 
 Uh, hey, is anybody taking pictures? 
 Of the kids? ‐ No, of the party. 
 Because I can. Oh, um... no, I mean, I bought these disposable cameras. 
 I thought you were working tonight. ‐ I don't have to anymore. 
 ‐ Well, Linda would be thrilled. I‐I could pay you, of course. 
 No, please. ‐ Are you sure? 
 ‐ Yes, I'm, I am sure. 
 ‐ Mom, I need your help. 
 ‐ Oh, my God, honey. 
 You look so beautiful. Bill, doesn't she look beautiful? 
 ‐ You look great, hon. ‐ Izzy, you're bleeding. 
 Oh. 
 ‐ I was shaving, and it caught... 
 ‐ Do you mind? ‐ No, go ahead. Go in. 
 ‐ Okay, come on, honey. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 So the shins and the knees are always so hard. 
 You can't push too hard. 
 I used to push too hard. 
 All right. There we go. 
 All right, let me fix your cut there. 
 There we go. ‐ Thanks, Mom. 
 ‐ You're welcome. 
 Perfect. 
 Except one thing. 
 Come here, honey. 
 Let's see. 
 
 
 
 Ah. This is, yes. Okay. 
 Okay. Mm. 
 Okay, let's see. 
 Now it's perfect. 
 ‐ Oh, Mia, I'm so glad you found it. ‐ Hi. 
 Yeah. ‐ You remember Linda from book club. 
 ‐ Of course. ‐ Yes. 
 ‐ Who could forget book club? 
 Thank you so much for doing this. That is so sweet. 
 It is above and beyond. ‐ It's not a problem. 
 ‐ Wait, I'm sorry, did...is Liz coming? ‐ Oh, no, she said she had a work thing. 
 Although it sounds like an excuse. She's allergic to children. 
 She tries to persuade anyone who will listen not to have them. 
 ‐ Maybe it's better off. She doesn't know how empty her life is. 
 ‐ Ele‐Elena told me your story. 
 ‐ It's a miracle, right? I mean, you hope, you pray. 
 Then you give up hoping and praying. And then... you know, there's losses. And then, you, uh... 
 I don't know. They say that, you know, your children find you and I think it's true. 
 ‐ And where is she now? ‐ Upstairs napping, thankfully. 
 We were able to put her down late so she makes it to cake. 
 Oh, that's so smart. ‐ And I completely forgot to tell you. 
 Debbie Jarvis is coming. ‐ But she didn't RSVP. 
 ‐ She did. She said she wasn't coming. 
 Oh, my God. Who does that? 
 ‐ Debbie Jarvis, apparently. ‐ What a piece of work. 
 ‐ You really outdid yourself. 
 God, I mean, Tevas? You're really f*cking doing this? 
 He's really f*cking doing this. Oh, my God. What about the pictures? 
 ‐ Wait, wait, wait, babe. We got to make an entrance. 
 ‐ All right, whatever. 
 ‐ Okay, are you really still mad about the stupid essay? 
 ‐ It's not stupid. 
 ‐ Okay, you know I talked to Pearl, right? 
 She said it was no big deal. That's a literal quote. 
 Why are you still making a federal case about this? 
 ‐ Because you don't get it. 
 ‐ Well, I get that it's our last Homecoming. 
 And we're king and queen. 
 And you look totally hot. 
 Like Tyson Beckford hot. 
 Mm. 
 ‐ Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon? 
 ‐ It's like a movie. ‐ Yeah. 
 Hopefully we don't get drenched in pig's blood. 
 ‐ Want to dance? ‐ If there was actual music. 
 Not this sh1t. 
 Oh, hey, Pearl. ‐ Hi, Lexie. 
 You look pretty. ‐ Thank you. 
 See? We're cool. 
 ‐ Yo, I thought you said high school dances were all hype, sweat, and handjobs. 
 ‐ No. ‐ Oh, but then again, you'd‐you'd only know about the hype and the sweat, huh? 
 Okay, dumbass, isn't there a Jen somewhere you need to manhandle? 
 ‐ Wow. 
 ‐ What? 
 ‐ Nothing, you just, you just look different. 
 ‐ Oh, my God, Cusano and Totts just got busted, like, doing it in the cage. 
 Her boob was, like, totally out. 
 Oh, my God, oh, my God, I love this song. Come dance. 
 Cheers, good to see you, too. 
 I, would you do Paula Jones? 
 I mean, sh1t, you've seen her. ‐ Uh, I'm good. Slippery slope. 
 ‐ Oh, hi, how are you? Oh, hi. 
 ‐ I love your dress. 
 ‐ Babe, babe, I'm gonna turn the game on in the other room, all right? 
 It's the playoffs. ‐ Okay. 
 And it's gonna go off as soon as she wakes up. 
 Hi. ‐ Yes, ma'am, hi. 
 ‐ Jeez. 
 That is the woman that's in your house every day, and Elena's okay with it? 
 ‐ It was Elena's idea. 
 ‐ You got to be kidding me. I want your life. 
 Debbie. 
 ‐ Elena. ‐ Hey, it's so good to see you. 
 I guess your RSVP got lost in the mail. 
 We missed you at book club a couple of weeks ago. 
 ‐ Well, I decided to sit it out given everything. 
 The subject matter seemed a little close to home. 
 ‐ I'm sorry, I don't follow. 
 ‐ Well, it's not really the place to get into it. 
 I think it's good the girls are taking some space. 
 ‐ Are you aware your daughter's been bullying my Isabelle? 
 ‐ Okay, Elena. ‐ Spreading rumors about her and calling her names. Did you know that? 
 ‐ Whatever April's done or hasn't done, it pales in comparison to your daughter's disgusting actions. 
 ‐ I'm sorry. What are you talking about? 
 ‐ Do you not know what your daughter did? 
 ‐ Not so bad, right? ‐ Yeah. 
 You make it better. 
 You make everything better. 
 ‐ Oh, my God. Izzy. 
 ‐ Would you let go of me? ‐ What are you doing? 
 ‐ Dancing. ‐ With Carl's hand on your ass? 
 ‐ Like you're not trying to touch Pearl's? 
 ‐ You know you don't need to prove anything, right? 
 ‐ You don't get it, okay? ‐ I get it. 
 You are someone that isn't afraid of anyone or anything. 
 Not Mom, not f*cking April. Look, I know you! 
 And you don't give a sh1t about what anybody thinks. 
 And I love that about you. 
 December! 
 December! 
 ‐ See you around. Hey, uh... 
 ‐ Bye. ‐ Rap. Our favorite. 
 ‐ Look, I know Shaker's not the easiest place to fit in, so if you ever need anything, hit me up. 
 ‐ Okay, thanks. 
 ‐ And um, with Lexie. 
 You know you don't have to be cool with things if you're not, right? 
 ‐ Why wouldn't I be cool? 
 ‐ I mean, she took your counselor story and wrote it as if it happened to her, so. 
 ‐ Wait, you mean the one I inspired? 
 ‐ Wow. Is that what she told you? 
 ‐ All right, movers and shakers, it's tiggity time for the court to come to the flizzor for their dance. 
 Where our king and queen at? Come on. 
 ‐ You‐you get that's, like, bad, right? 
 ‐ Bri. Brian, we're supposed to be out there like, right now. 
 ‐ I don't, I don't know what happened. 
 Wait, Lexie. 
 Bill. ‐ Yep. 
 ‐ I need to talk to you. ‐ Oh, it's a tie game, babe. 
 ‐ Debbie Jarvis just told me something very upsetting. 
 She said that Isabelle sexually accosted April this, this summer at a party. 
 ‐ Okay. ‐ No, it's not okay. 
 She's making up rumors about our daughter and saying them out loud. 
 ‐ Debbie Jarvis sells tacky jewelry out of her car and calls herself an entrepreneur. 
 So can we talk about this later? ‐ No. 
 You need to say something. You're the expert at defending Isabelle. 
 You need to defend her. 
 You think it's true. 
 ‐ Hon... 
 I think whatever's happening between April and Izzy, it's complicated. 
 ‐ Well, of course it's complicated. They're... they're teenage girls. 
 Did she say something to you? 
 I'm her mother. If she has told you something, I need to know what it is. ‐ I know. 
 And this is not the place‐‐ Hey, Bill. 
 ‐ Yo. ‐ Top of the 9th, two outs, bases loaded. 
 Hey, is that my beer? ‐ Yes, sir. 
 ‐ Hey, Elena. Great party, thank you. 
 Everything. 
 ‐ I'm gonna... let's talk about this later, okay? 
 ‐ Hey. 
 Hi there. 
 Hey, shh. 
 Okay. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 I just need a second. I just need a second. 
 I just need a second, okay? Shh. 
 I know it's you. 
 It's okay, shh, it's okay. 
 I'm just gonna move you over, okay? Just for a second. 
 Just for a second. 
 ‐ Baby May Ling. Hi, sweet girl. 
 Hi, May Ling. I know where your mommy is. 
 I know where your mommy is. I do. 
 Yeah. ‐ There you are. 
 ‐ Hey. ‐ I've been looking for you everywhere. 
 ‐ I'm‐I'm so sorry. I‐I... ‐ Have you been up here the whole time? 
 ‐ Yeah, well, I wanted to get some pictures of her when she was sleeping. 
 But then she woke up and she started to cry and... but now, she's great. 
 Mm. ‐ Yeah. 
 ‐ We should probably get her downstairs. 
 ‐ Oh, um, yeah, yeah. 
 You don't want to miss your party, May Bell. 
 ‐ What'd you say? 
 ‐ Um, she‐you don't... she doesn't want to miss her party. Mirabelle can't miss her party. 
 I'll see you in a few minutes. 
 ‐ Linda's gonna be so excited to have these pictures. 
 ‐ Of course. What mother wouldn't? 
 You should have worn Tevas. What's up, dude? 
 Hey, what's up, man? ‐ How are you? 
 Hey, party at Dano's. ‐ Party at Dano's. 
 Yeah, of course, of course. Yo, guys. 
 Hey, there's a bonfire at Dano's if you guys want to come. 
 He's got like, a Saturn full of pony kegs and sh1t to burn so... 
 ‐ We're good. ‐ Sure. 
 Yo, Trip, do you know how to get there? 
 Oh, yeah, man. 
 ‐ I thought we were gonna watch Before Sunrise. 
 ‐ Yeah, yeah, no, we are. 
 ‐ If you want to go, go. Uh, it's fine. 
 ‐ Oh, no, I mean… it was nice of Trip to ask, and I thought that maybe Lexie would be there, so… 
 ‐ You want to go because Trip and Lexie are going? 
 Then you should. 
 ‐ You know what? Um, let's just watch the movie, okay? 
 Why would you ruin Homecoming? ‐ That's what you're worried about? 
 f*cking Homecoming? ‐ God, Bri. 
 What f*cking hardship was I supposed to write about? 
 That I have to share a bathroom with my sister? 
 That my mom won't let me get my belly button pierced? 
 This is Yale. People write about living under Saddam Hussein or winning a gold medal in Atlanta, and the best thing that I could come up with was Pearl's math class, and it's honestly not even that f*cking great! 
 Look... 
 a year from now, I'll be at Yale and you'll be at Princeton. 
 And yeah, we'll be together and stuff, but it won’t be the same. 
 And I just…I wanted tonight to be special. 
 ‐ What are you doing? 
 Stop, you don't have to do this, okay? 
 What about Brenda and Dylan? ‐ f*ck 'em, you're right. 
 Andrea's like, 30. That show doesn't make any sense. 
 She's not here. ‐ Did you check the bathroom? 
 ‐ I checked everywhere. I can't find her. But I've got Mark's camcorder and still a couple of these little disposables you brought. 
 ‐ It just doesn't make any sense. Where did she go? 
 ‐ I'm so sure. You're sure? 
 ‐ Yes, because she has the red dot. 
 I'm going to call a lawyer first thing tomorrow‐‐ 
 ‐ No, no, you drive me to the house right now. 
 ‐ No. ‐ Please? I can drive myself. 
 Give me the key. ‐ No, no, no, no, hold on. 
 We have to find the best way‐‐ ‐ There is no best way! 
 It's the only way. I haven't seen my baby in a year. 
 I need to see her. What if they had Pearl? 
 ‐ Thanks again. ‐ Look. 
 I know I barely know you, but, uh... you seem upset. 
 And if there's anything I can do to help or just get your mind off sh1t... 
 ‐ Okay, we're recording. 
 ‐ Cake time, everyone! 
 Everyone come to the dining room. We're gonna sing "Happy Birthday." 
 ‐ That's my baby! 
 What are you doing? That's my baby! 
 You took my baby! 
 Get her out of here! 
 ‐ That's my baby! 
 ‐ Are you okay? Oh, my God. 
 May Ling, Mommy's here! 
 That's my baby! 
 ‐ You should go. 
 ‐ I'm 70 cents short. 
 ‐ Don't worry about it, hon. 
 What if she comes back? What if it's true? 
 ‐ This is your baby, Linda. No one's gonna take her from you. 
 No one. ‐ Well, how did she even find us? 
 ‐ I don't know. ‐ She just showed up here. 
 ‐ I don't know. 
 ‐ ‐ But I'm gonna find out. 
 ‐ Where's Pearl?
