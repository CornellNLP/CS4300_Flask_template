 Previously, on "11.22.63"... 
 I have something to say! I'll f*cking kill you. 
 On November 12th, I delivered to you a document of the utmost importance for Agent Hosty. 
 Jake : I remembered everything. This is dangerous, what I'm going to do. 
 Sadie : What are you gonna do? 
 Jake : I'm going to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. 
 It might be better if you guys go. 
 Why did you do this to me? 
 Sadie : Bill!  (Gasps) 
 President's gonna drive right by. 
 Jake : We gotta go. 
 (Engine grinding) 
 Jake : The past is pushing back. I'm gonna jumpstart it. 
 (Engine turning over) 
 (Dramatic music)

 Jake : No, no, no! This road is not closed. It's supposed to be clear. 
 (Police officer shouting) 
 Sadie : We can't turn around. 
 Jake : Oh, you gotta be kidding me. 
 Sadie : Oh, my God. 
 Jake : All right, come on. We can't stop. 
 Sadie : How do you know he's in the building? 
 Jake : 'Cause Lee goes to the Texas School Book Depository with a rifle under his arm. A guy that works there, named Bonnie Ray, saw him. He's gonna set up a shooter's nest on the sixth floor. The first shot goes off at 12:30. It misses. The next two don't. 
 Sadie : Can we get there by 12:30? 
 Jake : Come on. We have to get there by 12:30. Excuse us. Stay with me no matter what. 
 (Crowds cheering) 
 Jake : Sorry, sorry. Excuse me. 
 Kennedy! 
 Hey, watch it. 
 (Cheering and honking) 
 Jake : Oh, sorry. Sorry.

 Jake : Come on. 
 (Cheers and applause) 
 Jake : Wait, wait, Bonnie Ray! Wait. Wait, Bon... 
 How do you know my name? 
 Jake : We just... we need a minute, okay? Mr. Maynard, uh, is in there. We need to get inside. 
 I don't know you, sir. Mr. Maynard told me to close the building up at lunch. 
 Jake : No, no, no, no, you're not supposed to close. You're supposed to stay open today. That's what's supposed to happen. 
 Sorry, sir, I need to go. 
 Jake : Look, did Lee Harvey Oswald come to work today? 
 Yes, but I don... 
 Jake : Okay, is he in there on the sixth floor? 
 I don't know. 
 Jake : You do know. 
 Sadie : Jake... 
 Jake : You do know... you testified for the Warren Commission. You know! 
 Testified? Let me go. I haven't done anything. 
 Jake : Sadie, something's wrong. 
 Sadie : Jake! 
 Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! 
 Jake : Shh, shh, shh. Something's wrong. He's supposed to know about this, okay? The past is changing things, and anything can happen.

 Jake :  (Whispers)  They got away. 
 Why? What are you doing here, God damn it? 
 (Tense music) 
 Jake : Sadie... I need you to stay here, okay? Please, just stay here. Don't move. Okay? 
 (Tense music) 
 Jake : Lee, put your gun down. I don't wanna hurt you. 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Rifle reloads) 
 (Rifle reloads) 
 f*ck you!  (Gunshot)  f*ck you! 
 (Panting) 
 I came here to do something! Something important! You know what kind of potential I have? I can do anything that I set my mind to. 
 Jake : I know, Lee. 
 (Rifle reloads) 
 Jake : You don't have to shoot anyone. You don't have to do this. 
 (Tense music) 
 You don't know that. You don't know me. I'm gonna make my mark on this world. 
 (Tense music)

 Sadie : Is the president safe? 
 Jake : Yeah. 
 Sadie : So we did it? 
 Jake : Mm-hmm. Now, listen, you just hold right there, and I'm gonna go get some help. 
 Sadie : No. No. 
 Jake : Yes, please, let me go get some help. 
 Sadie : Don't leave me. Don't leave me.  (Sighs)  Can you just hold my hand? 
 Jake : Okay. Okay, I'm right here. 
 Sadie : Are you holding my hand? 
 Jake : I'm holding your hand. I'm not gonna go anywhere. 
 (Breathing heavily) 
 Jake : I'm staying right here, and you stay right here, too, okay? 
 Sadie : I told you we could do it. 
 Jake : Sadie... Sadie... Sadie, I'm supposed to be with you. That's why I'm here. Sadie, that's why I'm here. That's why I came back. Sadie, please. 
 (Sirens approaching) 
 Sadie : I know. 
 Jake : Sadie, please. Sadie! Sadie! 
 (Door bangs) 
 This is the police. 
 Jake : Sadie, please! 
 We have a body over here. 
 (Gun cocks) 
 Put up your hands! 
 Put up your hands! Put up your hands! 
 I wanna see your goddamn hands, boy! 
 Go on, now. Cuff him. 
 Jake : Can you help her? Please? Please! Please! 
 (Poignant music) 
 Jake : Help her! 
 Come on, now. 
 Jake : Goddammit, will you just help her? 
 
 You're going away for a long time, boy. 
 Long time? Old Sparky waiting for you. 
 Jake : Can you both please shut up?  (Grunts)  Ow. Ow. 
 It's too bad you banged your head on that door frame, son. 
 (Elevator bell dings) 
 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (All speaking at once) 
 Whoa, whoa, wait! Boys... boys come on now. 
 Both : Back it up. Back it up. 
 Back it way up. 
 Come on. 
 There's no room here, boys. Come on, now. 
 Back it up. Stand back, now. 
 (Crowd shouting) 
 (Dramatic music) 
 Do you know he's the shooter? 
 Come on, everybody, get back. 
 Are you a member of the Communist Party? 
 Did you kill the girl? 
 (All speaking at once) 
 Out of the way here. Come on, now, fellas. 
 (Tense music) 
 
 Take off your shirt. 
 Jake : Why? 
 Need to check the blood type for evidence. 
 (Tense music) 
 (Door opens) 
 (Reporters all shouting) 
 I'm Captain Fritz. This is Agent Hosty. What's your name, son? 
 Jake : You know my name. 
 Why don't you tell us yourself, just for the record? 
 Jake : Jake Amberson. You know, these are pretty uncomfortable. 
 We can put those in front. 
 Mr. Amberson, can you explain what you were doing at the Texas School Book Depository today? 
 And don't leave out the part about the dead girl and the dead fella. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Sighs) 
 Jake : Lee Harvey Oswald, the man whose body you found on the sixth floor, was attempting to kill President Kennedy. 
 How'd you know that? 
 Jake : He told me. Lee lived in the apartment above mine. Two days ago, I heard him yelling, "The FBI isn't gonna mess with me. I'm gonna show them," and then he came downstairs. He hammered on my door, and he said, "I'm gonna show everyone what I can do. I'm going to kill the president." 
 What did you say? 
 Jake : I said, "You're drunk." I didn't believe he was serious, and then, when I woke up this morning, I couldn't get it out of my head. I knew that Kennedy was in town, and I had this bad feeling, so... I went to where I knew Lee worked. I guess I... I hoped that I could talk him out of doing something stupid. 
 Mm, let me see if I got this right. Your neighbor told you he was gonna kill the President. You and your girl follow him to work to talk him out of it, and now he's dead. 
 Jake : I realize it sounds crazy. 
 It sounds more like horseshit. Your fingerprints are all over that rifle. We know that Oswald ordered that rifle under the name Alek Hidell. Now, that's your real name, isn't it? 
 Jake : No, and you're not gonna railroad me into some bullshit confession. 
 Son, I'm Dallas police. I don't have to railroad anybody. 
 Jake : Why didn't you stop Oswald? That was your job. 
 Excuse us. 
 Hosty, this is my jurisdiction. 
 I'm gonna need the room. Now. 
 All right. 
 (Reporters shouting) 
 Is there anything that you'd like to tell me, Mr. Amberson... Or is it Mr. Epping? 
 (Lighter clicks) 
 Jake : I went there to stop Oswald because he was attempting... 
 No, no, no, no. I heard that. We can speak freely now. 
 Jake : What does that mean? 
 I want the name of your handler. Give up the man who put you in play and I can get you out of the spot you're in. 
 Jake : I don't have a handler. I'm not a spy. 
 Jake, false identity, two houses in different cities minutes apart, a partner who you call your brother, who isn't, who committed suicide after you put him away under a false name, a murder in Jodie... This girl's husband... 
 Jake : Her name was Sadie. 
 Right. Should I, uh, proceed to the part where you have no identity at all prior to 1960? 
 Jake : Should I proceed to the part where your superior's gonna come in here and tell you to burn that letter that Oswald wrote to you two days ago? And what did it say? That he was gonna do something to change the world? 
 The FBI gets crazy letters every day. 
 Jake : No, you're covering your ass because Kennedy was almost shot in the street on Hoover's watch, and you should've known about it. Or did you know about it, and you just didn't take it seriously? Is that what happened? 
 That's a nice theory. Try this one on. Jake Amberson, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Sadie Dunhill. Three Russian-sponsored assassins living in the same Dallas apartment building are called to action the day Kennedy's motorcade route is announced. An FBI sharpshooter stops the attack. In the ensuing confusion, two of the Russian spies are killed, but one remains to stand trial. That's you, Mr. Amberson... Epping. 
 Jake : Doesn't even make sense. Oswald was killed with his own rifle. 
 Oh, I'm not gonna let a little thing like ballistics get in the way of the truth. 
 (Tense music) 
 People love JFK. The American people need to know who to blame. It's an easy conviction. 
 Jake : Mm. Talk about blame... You put me on the stand, I'm gonna talk about Oswald and the FBI. I'll give 'em some details about Hoover's surveillance of JFK and his mob mistress. Then we could go on to Marilyn Monroe and Bobby. I mean, you are spying on Robert Kennedy, right? 
 You are not making this any easier. 
 Jake : Look at me. I didn't try to kill the President. 
 I know. I don't care. 
 (Door opens) 
 Agent Hosty. 
 Sir... 
 Jake : Is that your superior? Right on time. 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (Whispering)  Under no circumstance is that letter to ever see daylight. You understand? You burn it. 
 (Tense music) 
 Are you clear on how you are to proceed? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Good. 
 (Reporters shouting) 
 Who are you? And what do you want? 
 Jake : All I wanted to do was save Kennedy. 
 (Door opens) 
 Y'all fall back. 
 Mr. Amberson has no comment. 
 Hosty, this is my jurisdiction. 
 Not anymore. 
 You think the feds are gonna tell me how to direct due process? Get the hell out of here! 
 Captain... sir, there's a telephone call for Mr. Amberson. 
 I don't give a good goddamn about a phone call for Mr. Amberson. I don't care if it's the President of the United States. 
 
 
 
 
 Shut those goddamn blinds. 
 Jake : Hello? 
 Hold for the President. 
 Mr. Amberson, Jack Kennedy here. The Secret Service tells me that, uh, my wife and I, uh, owe you our lives. Thank you. 
 Jake : You're welcome, sir. 
 The First Lady would like to speak with you. 
 Jake : All right. 
 Mr. Amberson? 
 Jake : Yes, ma'am. 
 I don't know how to say this, but I had a feeling that something terrible could've happened today. Thanks to you, it didn't. 
 Jake : Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. 
 I know that you lost your fiancée. I'm so sorry. 
 Jake : Thank you. 
 God bless you. 
 (Stirring music) 
 
 Lee Harvey Oswald's plans were interrupted by the selfless... 
 (Man shouting) 
 I can see the headlines now. "Teacher Kills Spy, Saves Kennedy." 
 American hero has requested to remain anonymous. In the resulting altercation, Oswald was killed by his own... 
 (Sighs)  So... Why do you think Oswald wanted to kill JFK? He loved Castro or he was working for the Russians? 
 Jake : No one will ever know, I don't think. 
 How'd you know about the letter? 
 Jake : Did you burn it? 
 I'll tell you if you tell me.  (Scoffs)  Something off about you, Amberson. You save the President's life and...  (Whispers)  Poof... You walk into that bus station and disappear. 
 Jake : I like privacy. 
 Mm. Far be it for me to pull the thread on the story of a hero. If I did, the whole thing would unravel. God knows this country wants a hero. An American hero who saved the President's life and values his privacy. That's how our story's gonna go. Amberson... sorry about your girl. 
 
 (Indistinct P.A. announcement) 
 Chaos reigned in Dallas today when a man aimed and shot at President Kennedy during a motorcade through Dealey Plaza. 
 (Gunshot, screaming on TV) 
 Shots fired! 
 The assassination attempt was recorded by a local citizen, who at this time has been unidentified. The suspected assassin is one Lee Harvey Oswald. Reporters spoke to his mother, Marguerite Oswald, at her home in Dallas. 
 Lee Harvey Oswald, my son, even after his death, has done more for his country than any other living human being. 
 Mrs. Oswald, was your son a Communist? 
 Crazy day, huh? Where y'all headed? 
 Jake : Lisbon, Maine. 
 Five bucks. 
 (Poignant music) 
 
 (Poignant music) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Jake : I'll fix this, Sadie. I'll be right back. 
 
 Jake : What happened to the f*cking diner? 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 (Woman coughing) 
 Jake : Excuse me. Uh, sorry to bother you, but what... what year is it? 
 2016. 
 Jake : And... and what happened to Al's Diner? It... it used to be right there. 
 I don't know. 
 (Coughing) 
 (Coughing) 
 (Man speaking gibberish) 
 (All grunting) 
 Hey, don't mess with me, you little f*cks. 
 (All fighting) 
 (Grunts) 
 (Grunts) 
 (Coughing) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Come on. 
 (Dark music) 
 
 Jake : Is this where you live? 
 Yeah. 
 Jake : Does anyone else live here? 
 Nope. 
 (Dark music) 
 Where'd you come from? 
 Jake : Texas. 
 Want a drink, Texas? 
 Jake : Sure. Oh...  (Clears throat)  Whoo. Strong. That your family? 
 I think you know. 
 Jake : What do you mean? 
 You came back. It was you who saved me and my family in 1960. You killed my dad. I remember you. I knew I'd see you again. I thought you'd be f*cking old. You an angel? 
 Jake : No. No. I just... when did... When did everything change?  (Sighs)  Just answer me... answer me one thing. What... Was John F. Kennedy reelected in 1964? 
 What the f*ck you want to know about Kennedy for? 
 Jake : I just do. 
 He was president two times before Wallace. 
 Jake : Wallace? George Wallace was President? What... what about Vietnam? Was there a Vietnam War? 
 No. 
 Jake : And Robert Kennedy, was he... was he killed in 1968? 
 I don't think so. 
 Jake : 9/11. Does that mean anything to you? What did Kennedy do when he was president? Anything good? 
 Oh, you talking about the camps? 
 Jake : The camps? 
 I took my mama and my brother and sister to a Kennedy refugee camp back in '75. After the first bombings, we didn't have no place else to go. The camps were bad places. Bad things happened there. Ellen got taken away, and Tugga joined the militia when he was 15. I never seen him again. When Mama died of the flu, I just ran away. 
 Jake : Why were... why were they called "Kennedy camps"? 
 'Cause he founded 'em when he wasn't President anymore after the riots and the... and the bombs. 
 Jake : Uh, I don't understand. I thought JFK would've made things better. 
 You don't understand this world. 
 Jake : I wanted to make a difference. That's why I did all this. 
 My mother, my...  (Melancholy music)  My whole family...  (Sighs) 
 (Melancholy music) 
 Why'd you save us? 
 Jake : I wanted to help you. Yo... your father... 
 I wish... He wasn't a... he was my dad. 
 (Melancholy music) 
 Jake : Yeah. Yeah. I never thought that everything would get so screwed up. I have to reset it. 
 Reset what? 
 Jake : Everything. I have to go. Bye, Harry. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 
 (Chuckling) 
 Jake : I don't want any trouble. Just passing through, okay? 
 "I don't want trouble." 
 Jake : I don't want any trouble. 
 "Don't want any trouble." 
 "I'm just passing through." 
 Jake : Get off me! 
 "Get off me." 
 Jake : Get off! 
 "Get off me." 
 (Laughs)  "Get off!"

 Sadie : Well, we never know which lives we influence or... Or when or why, but I am so very grateful to be part of yours. 
 (Applause) 
 Sadie : You older Jodie grads...  (Clears throat)  Who are here tonight... 
 (Crowd chuckles) 
 Sadie : You might remember Deke Simmons, and some of you may recall that little poem that he... That he loved... That he kept on copies on his desk so that he could hand them out to troublesome students... or students that were troubled. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sadie : Well, this was the poem. "We did not ask for this room or this music. We were invited in. Therefore, because the dark surrounds us, let us turn our faces to the light. Let us endure hardship to be grateful for plenty. 
 (Stirring music) 
 Sadie : "We have been given pain to be astounded by joy. We have been given life to deny death. We did not ask for this room or this music. But because we are here, let us dance."
