 Narrator : Previously on "11.22.63"... 
 Al, why did you show this to me? 
 I need you to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. 
 I wanna save him too. I wanna help. 
 We need to find out when Oswald starts talking about General Walker and who he starts talking about him to. 
 Lee is back. 
 That's George de Mohrenschildt. He's CIA. 
 This might be the start of the whole thing. 
 General Walker. 
 I have something to say! 
 Why come to a little place like Jodie when there's plenty of teaching jobs in Dallas? 
 I didn't really take to the city. 
 Call me Deke. All my faculty does. 
 Mr. Amberson, this is Miss Dunhill. 
 Yeah, we've... we met before. 
 People in Texas, they're not exactly welcoming to a divorcée. 
 To starting over. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 [clock ticking] 
 [muttering] sh1t. 
 [muttering indistinctly] 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 Whoo! All right, let's show 'em. 
 You are in the Marines now, son. 
 Let's see it. 
 Sharp shooter! [bell dings] 
 [heavy breathing] 
 Again. 
 [baby crying] 
 Marina? 
 [baby crying] 
 Marina! 
 [baby crying] 
 Oh-ho, Juney, it's... 
 [baby continues crying] 
 [speaking foreign language] 
 [laughs] Oh, baby, it's okay. 
 I'm... Daddy's coming, I'm... 
 It's okay. [crying continues] 
 Hmm. 
 [laughs] 
 [speaking Russian] 
 Mm. English. You are American now. 
 Marina. 
 Stand here. 
 Okay. 
 Why the papers? 
 'Cause people will want to know. 
 That I stand for something. 
 [laughs] You look ridiculous. 
 Lee, what's a man like you going to do with a rifle like that? 
 I am going to hunt fascists. 
 Ready? 
 Now. 
 Hey, Bill. I want you to watch them closely today. 
 I wanna know everything that goes on between George and Lee, okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, no problem. 
 I like being in this new apartment, right underneath them. Makes things a lot easier. 
 Hey. They still have no idea who we are. 
 Let's keep it that way. 
 All right. 
 Get me? 
 Yeah. 
 See you later. 
 See you later. 
 [door slams] 
 [playing "Gymnopedie no. 1"] 
 Howdy, stranger. 
 [continues playing piano] 
 You know, they say, "Smart is the new sexy." 
 I don't know anyone who says that. 
 Oh. Well... I say it. 
 Don't worry. Everyone's gone. 
 Do you know anything... more uplifting? 
 Not really, I'm just learning. 
 Oh. How about this? [clears throat] 
 [singing] How could I dance with another... 
 Ooh [Sadie laughs] 
 When I saw you standing there? 
 That's catchy. 
 Yeah. 
 You make that up? 
 Oh, yeah. Just me and my mates, John, Paul, George, and Ringo. 
 Your mates? 
 [laughs] Umm, yeah, my imaginary friends. 
 [both laugh] 
 You're so odd. 
 Just crazy... about you. 
 [throat clearing] 
 Mr. Amberson. 
 Yeah. 
 You have a moment? 
 When you take on a responsibility to teach, you also take on a responsibility to set an example. 
 An example? 
 Hell, it's harder for girls. 
 Different rules, you know? 
 I mean, just take a look around here. 
 Every pair of eyes you see, there's two pairs you can't see. 
 And they're all watching you, judging you, deciding if you're good or bad. 
 Girls here, they all wanna grow up to be just like Miss Dunhill, and that's a good thing, 'cause she's important. 
 She's a new kind of woman. 
 You care about her? 
 Yeah. 
 Then put her first. 
 Protect what's important in this life. 
 Discretion is the better part of valor, young man. 
 Right. 
 Jimla-doo. 
 I need to talk to you about your defense this year, son. 
 I'm gonna do something, I swear. 
 Someone has to. 
 [door slams] 
 Make... 
 Jake, drop that. Listen. 
 You gotta listen to this. 
 Here. Listen. 
 The... the fabric of society is being torn apart by people like General Walker. 
 We have seen before, haven't we? 
 Men of power, grabbing whatever they want. 
 Thank God they're speaking English. 
 I'm gonna do something, I swear. 
 Someone has to. 
 Make... make a-a statement. 
 You got a new rifle. 
 [both laughing] 
 Send a message. 
 An action that cannot be ignored. 
 I'm gonna. I tell ya, I've got it in me. 
 You have courage. 
 And I have some friends. 
 Powerful friends who can... help you be the great man you... you want to be. 
 I'm happy to introduce you. 
 [door slamming] 
 Marina, don't slam... 
 This... this changes everything. 
 What do you mean? 
 George just told Lee to assassinate General Walker. 
 And he said he'd introduce him to his friends... at the CIA. 
 George is a handler for Lee. 
 George is the gun. Lee's the bullet. 
 CIA's pulling the trigger. 
 And Walker is a test run for Kennedy. 
 But you said he misses Walker. 
 Then why would the CIA stick with the shooter that misses the target? 
 I don't know, I don't know. 
 Maybe Lee's part of the conspiracy right now, and he messes up, they cut him loose, but he goes rogue on Kennedy. I don't know. 
 So... What do we do now? 
 We got to follow them both, okay? 
 You take Lee. I'll cover George. 
 No, you take Lee. 
 No, no, no. 
 I'll take George. 
 No, you take Lee. 
 I don't want Lee. All he ever does is read books. 
 Then he'll be easy. 
 [knocking on door] 
 Close it up, close it up, close it up. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Close it up! Come on! 
 Oh, Miss Mimi. 
 How long did you think you'd get away with it, Mr. Amberson? 
 Or should I call you Mr. Epping? 
 [coughs] 
 Thank you. 
 Oh. 
 Bill, I respect your interest in my visit, but I think this matter is best handled privately between myself and your brother. 
 So, um, how did you find me in Dallas? 
 You're not hard to follow. 
 We never received your immunization records. 
 State school board requires those for employment. 
 Yours don't exist. 
 I investigated your degree and found out it was issued by what generously might be referred to as a "mill," and a call to your last known address in Kentucky revealed that you use the name Epping when it suits you. 
 Okay, all right, I got it. 
 I haven't taken this to Mr. Simmons. 
 I came to you because I believe in trust. 
 You wouldn't break our trust, would you? 
 No. 
 I wouldn't. 
 You're right, I haven't been telling the truth. 
 Well, not all of it. 
 My real name is Jake Epping. 
 I was given the name Amberson by the FBI when I went into witness protection. 
 Witness protection? 
 Yes, in 1959, I turned over state's evidence for a case against the Mafia. 
 What is the Mafia? 
 The Mafia. 
 Italian-American organized crime syndicate. 
 What did you witness? 
 Well... 
 I had this friend, Fredo, and his brother Michael had him killed on a fishing trip in Lake Tahoe. 
 In return for my testimony, the FBI gave me a new identity. 
 They set me up in Jodie, a place nobody would ever look for me. 
 And Bill and I just keep this place as a backup. 
 You know, just in case they try to pull me back in. 
 I see. 
 If you were revealed to be an imposter in the school, it would devastate this community. 
 Yeah. 
 I won't say anything about it. 
 Thank you. 
 It's wrong to conceal things from those you care for. 
 What... what are you saying? I-I should tell Sadie? 
 If I discovered this about you, anyone can. 
 When you refuse to tell people the truth, Mr. Amberson, you deny them their dignity. 
 And for some of us, dignity matters. 
 [bell rings] 
 ["Then He Kissed Me" by The Crystals plays] 
 ["Nothing Can Change This Love" by Sam Cooke plays] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Wanna dance? 
 What's the occasion? 
 It's Friday. 
 Yeah, I saw that in the calendar. 
 I don't wanna move too fast. 
 Oh, no. [laughs] 
 I know, I-I... 
 Maybe I overdid it, but, um, I've just been thinking... 
 I care about you. 
 Care about you too. 
 And I realized that being with me may be costing you something more than it should. 
 People talk. 
 So I thought, if we could just have a place, just a moment, where... we could be our real selves. 
 How's that sound? 
 A bit dramatic. 
 Yeah. 
 All I really want is just to be right here with you. 
 But if this is all, you know, too much, I-I, um, I-I totally understand. 
 I did bring that record player all the way from home, and it's really heavy. 
 And that is one of my favorite songs. 
 I guess I just, um... 
 I don't... know a lot about you. 
 I just wanna get to know you. 
 Like, what's your middle name? 
 Laurel. 
 Laurel. 
 My middle name's George. 
 Hey. 
 Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. 
 I just... I found this. 
 I seen your baby girl with it a couple times. 
 Thought she might be missing it. 
 I'm Bill. From downstairs. 
 Yes. Bill. 
 I'm Marina. 
 [laughs nervously] Real nice to meet you, Marina. 
 Thank you, Bill. For doll. 
 June, she has... not so many. 
 Hey. 
 You look different when you sleep. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothin'. 
 Tell me. 
 How come you never tell stories about your life? 
 About your family, about you and Bill growing up. 
 You want family stories, I can give you family stories. 
 That's not my point. 
 You got something to hide? 
 I don't wanna hide anything from you. 
 Good. 
 I want us to be honest with each other. 
 I just don't know if I can be. 
 Sometimes people hide things inside because they're afraid... that if they share them with others... 
 It's gonna ruin everything? 
 Is that what you're afraid of? 
 I feel like I'm an imposter in my own life. 
 Everyone thinks I'm one thing, but I'm something else. 
 I don't wanna be that way. 
 I wanna... wanna start things over right now. 
 Here, with you, in this room. 
 This is what I wanna build on. 
 Never look back. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right, I'm gonna tell you something that's gonna sound really crazy. 
 What? 
 Was that envelope there when we got here? 
 I don't know. 
 What's the matter? 
 It's just the hotel bill. 
 You know what, I... forgot I have to do something with Bill. 
 We... we'd have to go. 
 We're leaving? 
 I'm really sorry. 
 I'm sorry. We... we've just gotta go. 
 The CIA? 
 Yes. 
 We're getting close. 
 This is them telling us to back off. 
 If the CIA are worried about us, why don't they just kill us with a blow dart or rat poison or something? 
 This is a specific message. 
 They're saying not only they're gonna ruin me, they're gonna ruin Sadie too. 
 It's collateral damage. 
 So break up with Sadie. 
 What? 
 Break up with Sadie. 
 Leave... leave Sadie out of this. 
 I didn't get Sadie into this. 
 All I'm saying is we gotta double down, all right? 
 We need to clear up all this sh1t with Lee and George. Now. 
 You wanna solve it? 
 Yeah. 
 Shoot Lee. 
 I'm not convinced that it's Lee alone. 
 But this says we're getting close. 
 We're getting close to them, and they don't like it. 
 Just need to get a little bit more. 
 George, I don't wanna do this. Okay, let's just go home. 
 Be quiet. If they sense something's up, they won't let us in. 
 Yes? 
 Candy bar. 
 Come on in. 
 Voilà. 
 All right, look. 
 George said that he was gonna introduce Lee to his powerful friends. 
 This might be the meet. 
 I don't like this. 
 Just come on. 
 At all! 
 Come on, Bill. 
 We've gotta get close enough to hear them without them seeing us. 
 Gotta hear the plan go from the CIA to Lee. 
 Yes? 
 Candy bar. 
 [buzzer sounds] 
 Come on in. 
 All right. 
 This isn't gonna work. 
 Well, if you're staying out here, then you wait in the car, with the other babies. 
 
 
 
 ["Boys" by The Shirelles plays] 
 Wow. 
 All right, come on, we've gotta find Lee. 
 Come on, Bill. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Bill, Bill, Bill. 
 He's out cattin' around. 
 I know, calm down, just... 
 Welcome to the Shamrock Hotel. 
 Oh, hi. Hello. 
 Let me get y'all a drink and introduce you to the finer things in life. What do you say? 
 That sounds great. 
 Oh, attaboy. 
 Now, this is a high-class place. Don't you worry. 
 We even got them Michelobs in the fancy little bottles. 
 Great, we'll take two of those please, thank you. 
 Oh, I like you, son. What's your name? 
 I'm George. 
 And your friend? 
 Uh, this here's Wayne. 
 Bill. 
 Billy Wayne. 
 [laughing] 
 Hey, I really appreciate the hospitality, but, uh, not to be rude... I'm ready to go, if you know what I'm saying! 
 Ha-ha! All right. 
 Oh, believe me, I understand. Time is money. 
 Yeah. 
 Y'all see anything you like? 
 Um, well, uh, yeah. Uh... she looks great. 
 Dawn, got a live one. 
 Hi, hi. 
 Hello, mister. 
 Howdy. 
 [laughs] 
 And what about you? 
 Uh, he's broke. 
 What? No, that's not true. 
 Yeah, he's broke; he's gonna wait for me right there. 
 Come on, baby. 
 Bye! 
 I'm not broke. 
 I can do it. 
 Okay, hurry, I'm ready. 
 Okay, we're hustling. 
 Tell you what, Thursday night's a full moon. 
 It's like crocodiles eatin' chickens around here, all feathers and bones and sh1t. 
 Hey, Sally, fix your lipstick. 
 Just so's you know, it's 15 dollars for 15 minutes. 
 Half an hour's gonna run you at 25. 
 And you don't look like you've got an hour in you, so I won't bother. 
 And I don't do nothin' standing up, account of my bad leg. 
 You comin'? 
 Um, you know, I'm not gonna... 
 You're not gonna what? 
 Not gonna... I don't need you. 
 Mm, nah, nah, nah, nah, you ain't one of those. 
 We don't allow that. 
 It's okay. 
 No no, that ain't your party. 
 I know, I know, that's not what I mean. 
 That... that... no! Agh! 
 You okay? 
 You sorry sons-a-bitch! 
 What? Quiet! 
 [screaming] 
 Shh! Shh! Quiet! 
 Shh, shh! 
 [screaming] 
 Police! Freeze, this is a raid. 
 f*ck! f*ck! 
 [indistinct yelling] 
 Whoa, boy. Where you going in such a hurry? 
 sh1t. 
 I didn't see Lee or George in there. 
 Yeah, well, George knows people. 
 There's no way he ends up in a goddamn drunk tank. 
 Solicitation of a prostitute? 
 Maybe I had you figured wrong, Jake. 
 Bill, I can understand, but you... 
 What? 
 Deke. 
 Don't bother, son. 
 I don't wanna hear it. 
 I know it's a lot to ask, but maybe we could keep this between us? 
 You understand what I mean? 
 All right. 
 Hold on a minute. You're not going anywhere. 
 What do you mean? 
 You've got a class in 30 minutes, and I don't have a sub. 
 Can I change my shirt? 
 Nope. 
 Deke. 
 You about to get a lesson in reaping what you sow. 
 Close the door, Bill. 
 Good morning, Miss Mimi. 
 Good morning, Mr. Simmons, sir. 
 Well, I believe it might be time for us to look at that summer school schedule. 
 [coughing] 
 Morning, Miss Mimi. 
 Mr. Amberson. 
 Perhaps you'd like to review the dress code in the teachers' manual. 
 No, I just... 
 You just what? 
 I just need a tie and a belt. Can you help me? I... 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Thank you. 
 Coffee. 
 Miss Mimi, who is that? 
 That is Mr. Clayton. 
 Sadie's ex? 
 What's he doing here? 
 Mr. Amberson, that is none of your business. 
 Sadie? Sadie! 
 It's from the leather shop. You'll have to do without a tie. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 I can't do this right now. 
 Sadie. 
 No, I-I don't wanna do this right now. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 What? Just talk to me. 
 He's not gonna give me the divorce. 
 All right. 
 I thought it was gonna be different here. 
 But he found me. 
 So he's not gonna let it happen. 
 How did he find you? 
 My mother told him. 
 Why are you so upset? 
 Well, you remember... when you said everyone has something they're afraid to share? 
 Yeah, but there's nothing that you could share... 
 You don't understand. 
 Then tell me. 
 It will be okay. 
 I promise. It'll be fine. 
 When I met Johnny, I thought he was the most charming man I'd ever met. 
 We'd never done much... physically. 
 I just thought he was old-fashioned. 
 On our wedding night, he, uh... he got real tense. 
 Didn't wanna kiss me. 
 He just asked me to close my eyes. 
 So I did. 
 And then he took my hand, and he put it on himself. 
 And I screamed. 
 Why? 
 'Cause he had a clothespin on him. 
 What? 
 I didn't know what to say, so I laughed. 
 And then he hit me. 
 So I started crying, and he hit me again. 
 And then he put his hand over my mouth and he got on top of me. 
 When he was done, he said, "Go wash your wormy hole. You're dirty." 
 Why didn't you leave him? 
 Well, I tried to tell my mother, but she said it's a wife's duty to take care of her husband. 
 And so I did. 
 I never should have told you. 
 You think I'm disgusting. 
 What? No. No. 
 Sadie, no. 
 I ruined it. 
 No. 
 Sadie! God... 
 I ruin everything... 
 [bell rings] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Bill? What are you doing here? 
 George came by the house. 
 Keep your voice down. 
 He wanted Lee to come with him at 4:00. 
 He said his two friends wanted to meet today. 
 Had to meet today. 
 Lee wasn't having any of it. 
 He was still pissed off about last night. 
 He said he's got something he has to do. 
 Why aren't you with him right now? 
 'Cause he went to sleep. He works the swing shift, later. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. 
 You follow Lee. I'll follow George. 
 sh1t. 
 Come on, lady. 
 sh1t. 
 Hiding in plain sight. Typical CIA front. 
 Come on. 
 Where are you? 
 [footsteps on stairs] 
 [door closes] 
 I don't wanna fight, baby. 
 Look, I got you something. 
 Wait... 
 It's the only photo of the three of us together. 
 It's just, you know, I-I had it framed for you. 
 [speaks Russian] 
 If something happens to me, I want Juney to have it. 
 To remember her papa by. 
 What do you mean, if something happens? 
 There is something important that I have to do. 
 I can't tell you what it is, but it's a good thing. 
 [speaks Russian] 
 It's okay. 
 It'll be okay. Shh. 
 [both speaking Russian] 
 [heavy breathing] 
 [speaking Russian, moaning] 
 [whispering] f*cking hell, Jesus Christ. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [metal scraping] 
 [engine revving] 
 You said he'd be here. 
 I know. 
 Well, where is he then? 
 [engine rumbling] 
 He's hard to handle. I'm doing my best. 
 General Walker, as we discussed. 
 [dog barking] 
 Shh. 
 [barking] 
 They are filthy animals, aren't they? 
 Now, I don't think that we have been formally introduced. 
 Johnny Clayton. 
 I'm Sadie's husband. 
 Did you follow me? 
 Well, I wanted to talk. 
 Make sure that you got my message. 
 What message? 
 The photographs... of you and my wife. 
 That was you? 
 Mr. Amberson, you've been bad. 
 And you need to... you need to understand what's at stake. 
 You have no f*cking idea. 
 Oh... [laughs] 
 Let's try to handle this without profanity. 
 f*ck you. 
 Oh. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 You ever talk to Sadie, or go near her again, I will kick the sh1t out of you and leave you in a ditch. 
 You get my message? 
 Sadie is my wife. 
 She belongs to me. 
 Now, if you try to breach that bond, then... 
 Then there will be consequences. 
 For the both of you. 
 How's your clothespin? 
 What, are you wearing it right now? 
 You live in a small town. 
 People love to talk. 
 Now what do you think they'll say once they learn your sad little secrets? 
 Did your daddy put that on you? 
 Oh, no, that was your mommy. 
 No. 
 [stammers] 
 She... she shouldn't have... 
 Shouldn't have told you that. 
 Give her the divorce, and then crawl back under your rock, you sorry sack of sh1t. 
 You two deserve each other. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 These are for you. 
 People... people wanna think that that's what life is like, that it's flowers and hearts. 
 But it's not. 
 It's messy. 
 Things get broken. 
 I don't want you here 'cause you feel sorry for me. 
 That's not why I'm here. 
 I'm here because I love everything about you. 
 No matter what happened to you, or what will happen to you, it's not all bad. 
 Because the person standing in front of me is a wonder. 
 You are a wonder. 
 [indistinct muffled yelling] 
 Bill? 
 What going on? 
 [yelling] 
 There's two hours of Russian bullshit on that tape if you wanna catch up. 
 Me, I'm done. 
 [slap] 
 [screaming] 
 [thump] [screaming] 
 Lee, stop! 
 All right, that's it. 
 That son of a bitch. 
 Please stop! 
 You can't, no, no, no. 
 I swear to God, I'm gonna punch you in the f*cking throat. 
 You can't get involved in their lives. 
 You can't interfere. 
 Listen to what he's doing to her. 
 He's hurting her. 
 She lives! 
 It's all about you. 
 Get the f*ck out of my way. 
 You can't! You can't. I'm sorry. 
 Okay? I'm sorry. 
 Listen. Listen, listen. 
 It stopped. It stopped. 
 You're a f*cking asshole. 
 [door opening] 
 Hey. 
 Smoke? 
 Lee not like. 
 I won't tell. 
 [sniffles] 
 Morning, Deke. 
 I'll be back in 15 minutes. 
 Hey, where's Mimi? 
 Out sick. 
 And watch yourself. It's Miz Mimi. 
 What's wrong with him? 
 I don't know. 
 What is it? 
 He did it. 
 I don't know why, but he did. 
 That's great. 
 We should go celebrate. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Sadie? 
 Hmm? 
 [mouthing] 
 Me too. 
 See you later. 
 Okay. 
 [indistinct race announcements on the radio] 
 That's it. That's it. 
 Go! Gah, yeah! Come on! 
 Agh! Whoo! 
 Hey. 
 Did you win? 
 Yeah. 
 I used Al's book. 
 It's all right. It's for both of us. 
 Look, the thing with Marina... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mm. 
 What we're doing is a crazy, crazy thing. 
 And I can see there is no way I would ever be able to do it without you. 
 We're a team. 
 Yeah. 
 We're a team. 
 Okay? 
 All right. 
 I got to get back to Jodie. You gonna be all right? 
 Sure, I got some plans for the winnings. 
 Yeah? Hope you're not going back to the Shamrock Hotel. 
 [laughs] 
 No! 
 Okay.
