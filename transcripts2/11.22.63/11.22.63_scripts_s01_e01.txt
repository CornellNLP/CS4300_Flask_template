 The day that changed my life. 
 The day that changed my life wasn't a day but a night. 
 It was Halloween night. 
 I was Buffalo Bob, and I had the real cowhide vest. 
 It was 1960, and I lived in Holden, Kentucky. 
 I loved Zagnut bars, and my sister Ellen loved Baby Ruth bars. 
 My brother Tuggah loved everything. 
 I don't love Halloween anymore. 
 It was the night my mom, my brother, and my sister was murdered... 
 [screams] 
 With a hammer. 
 [woman screams] 
 I remember the blood smelled like pennies. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 My father killed everyone but me. 
 I don't like to remember it, but I can't forget it. 
 The end. 
 I know it isn't very... long. 
 Harry, that... that's a powerful story. 
 Thank you for sharing that with us. 
 Now, why was this good? 
 Because when we heard it, we knew him. 
 It was honest. 
 What Harry wrote was very painful. 
 The truths probably made us all feel a little uncomfortable. 
 Because of that, it was... It was very powerful. 
 Let me see that. 
 Boom. 
 [applause] 
 Good job. 
 Good job. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Thanks. 
 Bye. 
 See you. 
 Harry, hey, that was... That was something. 
 I never got an A+ before. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm going for a promotion. 
 Can you write a letter to the principal? 
 Only if you promise to give me a raise as soon as you're running this place. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, see you.

 I do make a diet burger. 
 It's called a salad. 
 Right.

 Did you get a chance to talk to him before? 
 He died when I was on the plane to see him. 
 I'm sorry. 
 There's three sets to sign. 
 One for you, one for me, and one for the lawyer. 
 Need a pen? 
 I signed already. 
 Right. Always prepared.

 Nope.

 You shouldn't be here. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 Do you hear me? Huh? 
 You shouldn't be here! 
 What the f*ck was that? 
 That was October 21, 1960. 
 No, it wasn't. 
 Now you understand why I needed you to go in there. 
 What are you saying? What are you saying, this is a... 
 Hard to find the right words, I know. 
 But you go through there, and it's 1960. 
 You're saying this is a time portal? 
 I call it a rabbit hole. 
 How long has it been there? 
 Since I had the diner. 
 Who else knows about it? 
 Just you. 
 If I told anyone else about it, they might try to stop me. 
 They'd try to stop you? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Al, why did you show this to me? 
 I need you to do what I couldn't. 
 I need you to go back there to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. 
 You heard about the butterfly effect? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Do you think that if JFK lived, Robert Kennedy would've run for president, seriously? 
 It's doubtful. 
 So, if Bobby doesn't run, that means no Sirhan Sirhan at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968. 
 Save JFK, save his brother. 
 And that's what I mean about the butterfly effect. 
 Then there's Vietnam. 
 Uh, okay, so if you save JFK, then there's no Vietnam? 
 Johnson was the one who escalated everything in Nam. 
 If Kennedy had survived, no way does that escalation continue. 
 Those boys... would've lived. 
 Al, I get it, but changing the past to make it how you think it should be just seems... 
 You think Vietnam unfolded exactly as it should have, that recent American history was just hunky-dory? 
 Saving JFK is a theory. 
 You don't know what it's gonna change! 
 You know what I know? 
 You save Kennedy's life, you make the world a better place. 
 God damn it! 
 Al. 
 Don't you want to do any f*cking thing that matters? 
 I'm just saying you don't have any proof. 
 You don't know that what you do in the past is gonna change anything here. 
 Go see. 
 You check for yourself.

 Yeah. 
 No matter how long you stay... 
 Three weeks, three years... 
 When you come back, only two minutes will have passed here. 
 Two minutes? Who makes up these rules? 
 I'm just explaining that, if you want to change something forever, you can't ever go back. 
 Going back erases what you did before. 
 All right, who's the guy with the hat and the yellow card? 
 He's some bum. 
 Well, he got up in my face. 
 I mean, he seemed to be the only one that noticed me come and go. 
 Just forget the yellow card man. 
 He's not important. 
 What's important is that we have a chance here. 
 A chance to change people's lives. 
 I saw you sitting there with Christy, and I knew you could do this.

 [chuckles] Come here. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 I thought you didn't have any hobbies. 
 Who do you think killed Kennedy? 
 People seem to think it was Lee Harvey Oswald. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, in a conspiracy with the mafia, CIA, FBI, the Russians, babushka lady on the grassy knoll. 
 Lot of books written about it. 
 Most of them written about Lee Harvey Oswald. 
 Guy doesn't make sense. 
 U.S. Marine, defected to Russia, came back, but everyone who wrote about Oswald studied him after the assassination. 
 I saw him before. 
 I saw him when he came back from Russia. 
 In 1962. 
 What the hell are you staring at? 
 Nothing. 
 Yeah, well, mind your own. 
 Why didn't you shoot him right there? 
 I don't know whether Oswald was the man who did it, and I still don't know. 
 Not gonna shoot someone because of maybe. 
 There are hundreds of questions that haven't been answered concerning Oswald and that day. 
 This is a... this is a big one. 
 Who's this? 
 Walker. 
 Ran for Texas governor. 
 You know that in 1963, six months before Kennedy was shot, there was an assassination attempt on this man? 
 Okay. 
 Bullet came from a 6.5 caliber Carcano rifle. 
 Same exact make of gun that killed Kennedy. 
 Well, did you go back and see Oswald shoot at Walker? 
 That's what I want you to do. 
 How? 
 I want you to make it to April 10th, 1963. 
 And if Oswald fires that gun alone, you got to take him out. 
 Hold on, what are we even talking about here? 
 We're talking about seeing if Oswald took a shot at Walker. 
 I go back through the rabbit hole, I come out in 1960. 
 You want me to hang out for three years? 
 Two minutes here. 
 What am I gonna do in 1960?

 Yeah, baseball and boxing mostly. 
 This is how you survived? 
 You spent all your time back there gambling? 
 That, and there was a butcher I liked on Main Street.

 Oswald doesn't get back from Russia for two years. 
 And in 1963, somebody shoots at General Walker. 
 In the meantime, there are plenty of other leads to follow. 
 On October 26th, follow George. 
 Just go where he goes, then you'll understand. 
 Who the hell is George? 
 That tastes like snot. 
 Yeah. 
 George de Mohrenschildt, Russian expat. 
 He's educated, charming, rich, belongs to the Dallas Petroleum Club, and in 1962, he becomes Lee's best friend. 
 We heard there was a couple, moved here from... Russia, and they were having a very bad time, financially, and so I went to see them. 
 Tell me, Jake, why is this guy hanging out in Lee's shitty apartment? 
 They're swingers? 
 [laughs] 
 Lee had taken the cigarette from her and had put it out on her shoulder. 
 If Oswald had a handler, it was him. 
 All right, hold on. You lost me. 
 A handler? What... what does that mean? 
 George told Oswald to shoot Kennedy? 
 If Lee was set up, then George was the only guy who could've done it.

 So George de Mohrenschildt might be an informant, might work for Russia. 
 He's got interests in Haiti, pals around with Duvalier; who knows what else. 
 He told a reporter in 1977 that it was the CIA who gave him Oswald's address. 
 And then he was asked to testify in front of the House Committee on Assassinations. 
 Next day? 
 He committed suicide. 
 Supposedly. 
 I followed him while I could in 1960.
