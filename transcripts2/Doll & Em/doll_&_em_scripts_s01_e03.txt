 And let's go for it. 
 Number two. 
 Okay, look over here. 
 Over here. 
 And... good. 
 And... 
 Great, on a bell. 
 [Bell rings] 
 Picture's up. 
 Let's go for it. 
 Em, take a look to John, please. There? And action. [Music playing] Do I look good like that? I can't tell. Yes. Do I look much younger? Do I? You look completely mad. Do I? That's perfect. Oh, yes. Thank you so much, Barbara. They're beautiful. Now they are perfect, but before? What? Awful. [Both laugh] Oh, my God. Really? Mm. What do you mean? You British people have awful feet. I thought that was British teeth. Teeth and feet. Are you serious? Mm-hmm, very. Well, why don't you have a go at Doll's feet? Okay, I got time. No, no, I'm fine. Go on, Doll. It'll be nice. Go on. [Laughing] Go on. Um... Yes. Oh. Which are worse, hers or mine? No comment. [Em laughs] Morning. Morning. Does he even know what tomato sauce is? [Hand brake ratchets] Well, you tell him I love him and I miss him. They're testing you on the whole thing today? Oh, my goodness. You poor girl. How are you feeling about it? Thanks, Kevin. Thank you so much. Well, it's gonna be completely fine. Hey, Jim. Hey, Marissa. How are you guys? Hey, Dolly. Hi. No, the elevens are a doddle. Yes, they are. It's just 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, blah-Dee-blah all the way up. Oh, I know it's horrible, but you're gonna be brilliant. Can you just wait a minute? Em's 10-1. Sorry? She's taking a wee. Ah, right, sorry. She keeps going every couple of minutes. I think it's just 'cause she's nervous. Mm. Stand by. I have Dolly. Copy that. The director would like to see you on set. Oh, okay. Can we make sure no one disturbs her until I get back? Of course. Great. Thanks so much. Hey, Stacy. Hi. Morning, John. Look at Paula running. Run, run, run. Hi, Georgiana. Hi. You need to think about getting it lasered. Really? Mm-hmm, it'll definitely help. I don't know why, it scares me for some reason. But you just need, like, a week off of work. Oh, God, really? Sorry, that really tickles. 'Cause it will go brown. It's a fan brush for mascara. Then it'll peel off. This'll be good. Are all these brushes... everything... All the brushes, all the makeup... Hey, Emily. Hey. How are you? I'm good. How are you today? Just, uh... I heard you were a little nervous and I wanted... What? No, I'm excited. I'm not nervous, I don't think. Okay, is there anything you need for the scene? No, I... what do you mean? Just motivation-wise, I want to make sure you feel completely comfortable. We have to dig deep today. No, I... I... I'm fine, I think. Basically your father's just died. You inherit the family, so... Whether you like it or not. Just think of al Pacino in "The Godfather." No. Don't think of al Pacino in "The Godfather." Please, it's nothing like that. Like "The Godmother"? [Doll laughs] I... I've got it, I think, Mike. Thank you, I'm pretty sure I get it. And, Mike, just for me, you know, what's the motivation for mourner number two? What's she feeling? [Both laugh] Sorry. Uh... You're awesome. Just take... take care of her out there, okay? Yeah, yeah, I will. Thank you. Bye, thanks. Oh, my God. What is all that? Are they all like that? No. Well, I don't know. I mean, he's sweet. He's only trying his best, but... [Groans] Oh, um... No, I'm... I'm not sure about the hat. I'm sorry, sweetie. I don't think it's negotiable. I just think it's mean to insist on something when, you know, the actor is obviously feeling uncomfortable. Especially when it's such a big scene. Yeah, no, I do understand. Why is he walking like that? I don't know. He's from Cape COD. Perhaps that's how they walk there. Where am I from? [Laughs] Is It East Chiltington? Yes. Where am I from? I don't know. Somewhere very sexy. Not really sexy. 'Cause I broke up with my boyfriend about a month ago and then I've been staying with Em... That's my best friend, Em. And she got me a business class ticket... I'm a bit anxious about this one. Why? I don't know. I've got to emote. How are you feeling about getting in there? Why is she wearing the hat? Oh, God, do I not have to? No, she wouldn't wear the hat in the funeral home. Oh, that's such a relief. Oh, please, don't take the hat off. I did her hair around the hat. I don't think Em's really feeling the hat. No, I'm not. It's from the wrong era, isn't it? I don't know. To me, it looks like it's from the 1930s. Look, it doesn't matter. It just doesn't suit her. It makes her nose look big. Am I right, Larry? Well, I've been doing this since I was 14. I've found there is no right or wrong, Mike. Okay, then let's lose the hat. Oh, thank God. Thank you so much. What? Oh, you've got, like, a red line where the hat was. It's fine. We'll just go with the hat. And we're going with the hat. Told you so. What? The hat is appropriate for a funeral. But it doesn't look good. It does, too. I think you're telling yourself you're not gonna cry. Yeah. I just think it's very emotional... Yeah. And it's... You're saying good-bye. Mm-hmm. You're assuming power, whether you like it or not. Mm-hmm. Like "the godfather." No, it's not like that. No? Well, it is sad. This is our last scene together, isn't it? It is? Yes, I think so. No, we... They cut that one in the hospital, right? No. Yes. Oh. Nobody told me. Oh. I'm gonna miss you, daddy. What about that scene? Okay, I guess we're good. All right, let's fly in the mourners. Well, what about that scene? And we are set. And action. [Sighs] Sorry. Mmm, sorry. Okay, back to one. Ready, Em? Yeah. And action. sh1t. Makeup, can we get the tear stick? No, I don't need it. I can do it on my own. Can you just give me one more chance to get it? Sure thing. Didn't your father die in real life? Can't you just use that? Okay, one more time. All right, resetting. And action. [Sobbing] Keep going, keep going. Push in on her. Tear stick, tear stick. [Sobbing continues] Cut, perfect. Wow. That was amazing, Dolly. [Scattered applause] Print that. Let's move on. Oh, very happy. A scene-stealer. 
 
 Oh, God, I can't believe you were in there. No, it was great. Really? Yeah, yeah, really, truly. Oh, I felt so awkward. Why? I don't know. No, it was simple, it was elegant. You missed all the cliches. You just let it be. It was awesome. It's so fun to see you again. And you. I'm so psyched you're here. [Quietly] You were great. [Quietly] Thank you. [Lock turns] Hey. Hey. [Laughs] Waterworks. Very impressive. Thank you. So I was standing behind Em and I'm supposed to be the second mourner. Second mourner? Yeah, mourner number two. Chief f*cking mourner, if you ask me. Well, I don't know... Number one mourner on the call sheet. Thank you so much. So they asked me to... Where did that come from? Um, I don't know. I don't even know. How did you do that? I don't know, but something happened. I really did feel it, and then the weirdest bit was that I couldn't stop crying. And then I could hear everyone clapping and clapping. Yeah, clapping for you. And they were clapping for me. Yeah, yeah. Not for her. Well... [Faint laughter, conversation] Well, I'll wait the first couple weeks. You always think it's garbage. She knows. And so what happens then? Then you start thinking it's brilliant, do you, after the first couple weeks? No, there's usually three processes in movies here. You're sort of overvalued or you're overhyped. You overhype yourself, everybody's brilliant. And then you get used, and then you get discarded. It's always in that sequence. Overvalued. Overvalued. Used, discarded. Overvalued, used, and then abandoned. Yeah. Okay. [Knock on door] Yeah, come in. [Laughs] I do. Hey, Em! Em! Hey, Dolly. Actors eat first. Come up front. Thank you. Can I get a broccoli? Can I get some rice? Acting's been my career for the last few hundred years, but photography's my passion. Acting's like this... you show up, you have a terrific audition, they love you, they say, "we want older, younger, thinner, fatter, blonder..." Pick a parameter and he picks a dozen. But photography, i can see a scene, So, do you have a viewfinder? Hey, Doll, you want to eat with us? Jacob, get her a chair. Why do we always go out to set? Really, yeah, yeah. [Chatter continues] As a matter of fact, I saw it at staples the other... If there's a staples near you on your way home, staples has them also, this camera. [Laughing, chattering] Some of the staples have them, yeah. [Chatter continues] It's really adorable. I had it in Portofino... When I was in Portofino... We're back from lunch. And good luck with everything. Thank you. Good luck with your wedding. Thank you, thank you. We'll stay in touch. Will you email me? [Chattering] It was absurd. They were... Both? - They were... Yeah, they were... yeah. You didn't eat your pudding. Didn't like it. It looks pretty nasty. Yeah. Do you want to get a coffee? Yeah. Sorry, Doll. [In American accent] Who am I? You really don't... You really... you really, really... you really, really... [Vocalizes] Who am I? Who am I? You really don't remember me? [In American accent] I don't recall being introduced, no. Wow, it's really weird speaking like this. I don't know who I am, suddenly. Do you feel like that when you talk like this? I'm Valerie Lee. [Laughs] Wait. I'm Valerie Lee, the head of the McDonnell clan. A ballbreaker in a good... [laughs] I'm Valerie Lee, the head of the McDonnell clan. A ball-breaker in a good suit. Wow. So are you just doing the accent, or are you thinking that you're the daughter of an infamous gang leader? Mm. [Knock on door] Come in? [Door opens] Carla! Oh, my goodness. I am so pleased you're doing the piece. Me, too. Thank you so much. Such an exciting project, honey. I know, I know, I'm thrilled. Oh, good, and Mike is a genius. Yes, I'm so psyched to be doing it. Yay. You're welcome. Thank you, thanks a million. This is my friend Dolly. My assistant. Hi. Well, she's more my friend than my assistant. She's my best friend. We've known each other all our lives. Aw. Carla is the best casting agent in America. Stop it. She's the whole reason I'm doing this job. Oh, really? No, not true. It's really nice to meet you, and you did beautiful work out there. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. I know, she's amazing at crying. Carla, would you like something? Would you like a coffee or something? I would love a coffee, yes. Thank you. A latte? Yes, that's great. Doll, do you mind getting us a couple? No, 'course not. No, no. And get one for you, too. But not from here. Get some good ones. Okay. Okay. Carla, come on, sit down. Tell me everything. How have you been? I'm good. I'm really good. How's everything with John? Are you having fun with him? I am, actually. It's been kind of... it's been fine. It's been sweet. He's a sweetheart. You know, he's just... Yeah, he is. Is everything okay? Yeah, um, I haven't got any money. Sorry? I forgot you haven't given me my wages. I haven't got any money on me. Oh, my... Doll, I'm so embarrassed. No, it's fine. It's not, it's awful. I keep forgetting to pay you. I can't believe it. Just give me money for the coffee and then... No, I've got... look, I've just been given all this cash. It's totally perfect. I can pay you now. [Quietly] One, two, three, four, five. Thank you. And here's one for the coffee. Why don't you see if Mike and the camera crew want some? Okay. Is that all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, brilliant. Love you, Doll. Bye. Bye. [Door closes] Okay, so, I want to talk to you about another project. You do? I do. It's a big film. I mean, she's British, she's posh, she's tall. I mean, you're the perfect prototype. I know, and so I'm gonna call ICM, have them set up an appointment to put you on tape, yes? Okay. Okay. Go, Emily. [Both laugh] Carla, I really... Whatever happens with this, I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for everything, and you just... It's all you, and I'm so thrilled to be part of it. No. Oh, thank you. [Knock on door] Yeah, I'm just thrilled. Yes? Hey. Hey. Is Doll around? Yes, she... she just popped out for a minute. Okay. Aw, that was weird. Excuse me? Excuse me. Hey, how can I help you? Your car. Why are you parked there? You're not supposed to. Why am I parked there? Are you disabled? You have no sign. Yes, I'm handicapped. You are? Yes, I am. See? [Computer beeps, clicks] [Beeping] [Clicks] [Sighs] [Beeps, clicks] [Doll laughing] [Voices chattering] [Laughing] That's what she said. Yeah, I know. Where should we deposit this package? I got this. Oh, look at my pedicure. It's ruined. Oh, God. Look at that. It's so sad. Here we are. Look, your little bed. You're more than amazing. Okay. Let me just put this down. [Grunts] There we go. Hang on, let me just get... Ooh... wait. There. Okay, okay. Okay? Yep. Careful, sweetheart. There you go. Okay, can I touch this? Yeah, it's fine. Should I just swing it round? Yeah. There we go. Ooh. Oh, look at your little toes. It did get ruinned. I know, my first ever pedicure. Yeah. sh1t. What? That MasterCard i washed in my jeans. I forgot to order a new one. Oh, don't worry. Go to sleep. I can do it. I'm awake anyway. You're an angel. I love you. Yes, hi. I wanted to cancel and reorder my MasterCard, please. Can I have your number? 2732. Yes, that's right. Emily. That's her. I mean, me. Oh, thank you. Oh, God, you know, that was a good one, wasn't it? Thank you so much. Well, I've got an audition for this big romantic comedy, which is quite exciting. Um, my process? Um, well, you know, I just try and just really imagine myself in that position, you know? I mean, when I do an accent or something, I don't think I'm someone else. I'm still me, I'm just doing that accent. So I suppose I'd say I just try and put myself into the body of a mafia boss or a s*x bomb or, you know? Yeah, it can be quite tough. I mean, at the moment, I'm finding it really hard to get there emotionally. I just did a scene the other day and I just couldn't cry. Oh, yeah, no, in real life I cry all the time. [Music playing]
