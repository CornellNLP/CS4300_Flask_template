 Previously on 12 Monkeys... 
 You're walking through a Red Forest. 
 There's a house in the distance. 
 Cedar and Pine. You've been there before. 
 Messengers went back in time. Paradox Primaries. 
 [grunts] Just one more we don't know. 
 1957. 
 Upstate New York, a paradox so powerful,  destroys the fabric of time. 
 [thunder] 
 Spit in the face of death and leave your daughters to face off against the Army of the 12 Monkeys. 
 Ladies, mount up. 
 We're taking them to Titan. 
 We don't have a machine to bring you back. 
 [dramatic music] 
 ♪ [thunder] ♪ I don't want to be afraid anymore. [When We Get Together by Bob Kelly and the Pikes playing] Right now, it's January. Paradox happens November 7th at that factory. That gives us 11 months to find the Primary before the Messengers do. ♪ Primary's gotta be one of the employees. There over 200 people who work there. How are we going to figure out which one is the Primary? ♪ When we get together, we'll rock ♪ 
♪ Take off your hat, and let's rock, rock, rock ♪ 
♪ Take off your hat, and let's rock, rock, rock ♪ 
♪ Take off your hat, and let's rock, rock, rock ♪ 
♪ Take off your hat, and let's rock, rock, rock ♪ 
♪ Take off your hat, if you're gonna be in town ♪ 
♪ Take off your hat, and let's rock, rock, rock ♪ 
♪ When we get together, let's rock ♪ Cole : We'll have to get jobs there. Get to know people. Make friends. Blend in. Ok. Then what? Look out for the strange ones. Being Primary is like being schizophrenic. Look for people who twitch, talk to themselves, don't fit in with others, people who stand out. ♪ Take off your coat and let's rock ♪ 
♪ Take off your coat and let's rock ♪ And what if the Primary isn't unstable? What if... they seem normal? Then we have to check everyone... no matter what. No exceptions. Remember, the link between Jennifer, Tommy, and Kyle is that they each saw and drew the same thing... A face, a screaming monkey. Oh, hey, Cole. How are you, pal? Hey. Come on! Jeez Louise. What's the problem, Cole? Don't be such a pansy. [man laughs] Do you have any idea what a paradox is? I sure do. ♪ When we get together, let's rock ♪ 
♪ When we get together, gonna rock ♪ Hey, what... Give me... I... ♪ When we get together, we'll feel light as a feather ♪ Get your hand off of me. ♪ When we get together, gonna rock ♪ What? I like butts, okay? What's the big deal? [whispering] Thanks for the drink. Jesus, Railly, you are a piece of work. ["When We Get Together" ends] [tense music] That's it. We've been through everyone. We only have two days left to stop a paradox that will destroy the world, and we don't have a single lead. [dramatic music] ♪ You sure about this one? He's not Primary. Did you look at all the drawings? Maybe there was some kind of a code or a pattern. Did you go through every single page? Yeah, the ones that weren't stuck together. Trust me, it's not him. Sometimes you miss things. Really? Does that make me stupid or a liar? Neither one changes the fact the guy's not Primary. Look, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with these two. Are you sure that none of these people look like the Messengers you saw in 2043? I only got a good look at a few of them, not all. What about Sully O'Dare or Andrew Peterson? One of them... No and no. I checked, I told you. Check again. Peterson got fired for boozing on the job. He's not even gonna be there on the 7th. And O'Dare, I tried so hard to get to know O'Dare he thinks I'm trying to get into his pants. That's what you're worried about? None of these people are Primary. We got two days left. We need to focus. Maybe you've been wrong. Maybe the Tall Man lied to you. We haven't even seen any sign of a Messenger. We know there's gonna be a paradox. [sighs] Okay, what about you? What about me? Maybe you missed something. Hmm? All these, uh, supervisors and supply salesmen. Maybe you've been enjoying your job a little too much. I would be very careful about what you say to me next, Cole. Where are you going? Out. So I don't have to say it. [tense music] [sighs] [mellow rock and roll plays] Whisky sour. Thanks. Hey. Hey. Charlie. What are you doing here? It's, uh, my night out. I don't get it. Melinda says that I can't be home tonight. Says I can't just sit around and watch her be sick all the time. How is she doing? She has that beautiful, dark hair. Started falling out last week. It's that chemotherapy. You know, the same chemical that they put in her body is what they use in mustard gas? The same sh1t that killed people in that war... it's in her veins. I'm sorry. So what are you doing here? I'm just clearing my head. Let me guess, uh... she's getting tired of you being paranoid about people. [chuckles] I got my reasons. Commies? Yeah. [chuckles] I swear you see more red than goddamn Joe McCarthy did. Instead, you could go upstairs and put your arms around that pretty lady and make nice for once. It's not like that. Sure, it is. It's not. [music continues in background] Yeah. You're probably right. You're better off. I heard that she's been on more "dates" than that "Playboy" with Jayne Mansfield in it. Whoa, hey. See? You do care. And whatever is stopping you two, it isn't worth it. This whole world could eat sh1t and die. It wouldn't matter if you were together. ♪ You know... Melinda's doctor told me that I should think about buying her a nice gift for Christmas. Something special. Because he doesn't think that she will... ♪ It's just so cruel. So when I say what I say, you know I know. Because when it comes down to it, the only thing you'll be wishing for is more time. Trust me. [song end notes] [upbeat song begins] Speaking of, I'm gonna take my own advice and I'm gonna go home. ♪ See you at work, Cole. See you, Charlie. ♪ [door opens] [keys clatter] [suspenseful music] ♪ [silent] Shh. ♪ [sighs] It's over? Yes. I asked the operator to switch me into the one of the party lines near the factory. I heard people talking about a job. You know the drainage system they're always complaining about on the factory's roof? Yeah. They're hiring day laborers to fix it. One of them... Could be our Primary. That would explain why we haven't found them yet. Cole... [somber music] ♪ I know these months here have been hard. We haven't been very good to each other. The stress and... Yeah, there's never enough time, is there? ♪ I had... hoped that Ramse could find Titan and... and if the Witness were there, they could kill him, and undo all this somehow. But it's getting too late to rely on that. This is our last chance. ♪ [gunshots and screams] [bullets ricocheting] [overlapping yelling] [bullets ricocheting] Aah! [thud] Mother... for you. I'm sorry. I didn't know it would be like this. [ricochet] [sharp gasp] [gunfire continues] Aah! [gasps] [gunfire continues] [dramatic music] ♪ [overlapping yelling] Uhh! [somber music] [glass shatters] [flames roar] [loud thunder] [thunder rumbling] [somber music] ♪ Measure your life by counting precious moments. You... will conquer all obstacles. Your smile is a treasure to all who know you. Oh, please. [sobbing] Are you hurt? She was trying to protect me. [melancholy music] [sniffles] [thunder rumbles] [crying] [somber music] [thunder rumbles] Go see if they have any food... that ain't hanging from a rope. [thunder rumbling] [tense music] ♪ Call yourself "Bleeders"? Kill everybody that passes? You eat 'em too, huh? Headed to a place about 30 miles west from here. It's called Titan. You know what I'm talking about? Do you? I don't know what it's called, but there's a place with lights and sounds. What else? Some went in to see if there was anything to take. Didn't come back. We've been staying east ever since. All right. [eerie music] ♪ [thunder rumbles] It's coming. We have maybe a day or two, but that's it. People are tired, need rest. No stopping. Everybody, get your sh1t together! [water splashes] Let's go. Hey, hey. Hey! You don't order me around. I'm the Mother, not you. Wise are those who know that they are not wise. Your wisdom used to have meaning, and now it's just... Sorry to interrupt, ma'am. But the storms are moving. We should hurry up. Stop that. He killed you. Look at him. He knows it. And I decide what happens to him. Not you. Got it? We vowed to protect Mother. You are not her. [tense music] ♪ Well, we found their base camp. There's no food. These people were starving. [exhales] Like us. We should get the bodies down and burn them before we go. Yeah. [horse whinnies] [tense music] ♪ How far did you get? How far did you... It's not there! ♪ I used the tracker and the coordinates. Nothing is there. I scouted the entire area. You're wrong, Ramse. Titan doesn't exist. [tense music] ♪ 
♪ Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist. [metallic click] It does. She's wrong. No, I think you're wrong, old man. If you're willing to bet your life on this, that's fine. But we've already lost two sisters today. We're not losing any more. It's over. ♪ What are you going to do? You gonna take your girls? Huh? Where are you going to go? Huh?! [thunder rumbles] Take a look at those skies. Cole didn't stop anything. The only way we survive is if we find Titan and we kill the Witness. We're done here. Jennifer! You want to set your people straight?! ♪ Ramse. It's better to have a hen today than an egg tomorrow. Your present plans... Our... Mother... is... dead! ♪ We're done following this girl. [dramatic music] Then do as I say. [thunder rumbles] ♪ Oh-oh. Try not to die. Oh, come on. Don't. ♪ [grunts] [thud] Ooh! [grunts] [both grunting] [thwack] Uhh! Uh... ah! [suspenseful music] [grunts] Oh! [knife slices] No! [suspenseful music] Stop! [triggers cock] Don't! [thunder rumbles] No more killing! ♪ Stop. ♪ Weapons down. Our sister chose this for herself. [dramatic music] ♪ Please, Ramse. ♪ [knife thuds softly] Jeb Donaldson. Rory McEntire. Reginald Depuy. All right, gents, we're heading up on the roof to work on the drains. I'll be supervising you, because the last time we did this job, some nimrod fell off and busted his head clean open. Had to shovel him off the pavement. So watch yourselves, because I don't want to be dealing with that sh1t again. The system is gonna need cleaning, fixing, and we got three days to do it. Let's go. 
 
 Hey, Roger. Yeah. You going up to the roof with those guys? I don't got much of a choice now, do I? Hey, hey, why don't you let me supervise instead? I could use the overtime. It's gonna be freezing up there. You want to spend the next three days shivering your ass off, baby-sitting a bunch of mooks? Clear your shift. Meet me up there in 20. All right. Why on earth would you sign up for such a sh1t detail? You see that guy? The squirrelly one on the end. Yeah, what about him? Few years ago, I did some time. For what? Bar fight. Doesn't matter. Anyway, he was in there with me. Did something to a lady. Used to draw dirty pictures. If you get my drift. I just want to keep an eye on him. Yeah. [tense music] ♪ [softly] I found a way in. One of the guys on the crew, he had that... twitchy quality to him. Did you talk to him? I'm heading up there right now. Listen, the guy's name is Reginald Dupuy. See if you can find any hiring paperwork, maybe with an address on or something. Dupuy, I'll see what I can find. Cole, if it's him... I'll do what I have to. [suspenseful music] Hey, man, watch what you're doing. These are my good shoes. ♪ Hey, your name is Reginald, right? Yes, sir. Why don't you come with me? [tense music] ♪ Hey, there, Rocky Marciano. You know, you're not supposed to be going through those hiring files. [whispering] Those are confidential. I was looking for paper. Here. You from around here? You serve in the war? No? [suspenseful music] [background chatter] [phone ringing] ♪ Spend any time in the hospital? Draw things you see in your head? Monkeys? ♪ Hear voices? Talking about things that haven't happened yet? Red Forests? Green to Red? Time, uh... ♪ Time... Time to go. Back to work. ♪ Where have you been? Tried to follow him, but I lost him at the train tracks. Cass, I think it's him. Cole... It is him. [dramatic music] Those coordinates say Titan should be right here. I told you it wasn't. The tracker you were using was hooked up to the transponder in the Humvee that burned down. It sent you in the wrong direction. No. There's hills and valleys here. You could've been close and you missed it. So this is the route we should take, but we don't know what's out there. There's less than 20 of us now. Well, we do what we can with what we have. I'm not stopping. They're not going with you. I can't make them. We have to go with them. The time-storms will kill us if we stay. Convince them... They need your wisdom. My wisdom? You want my wisdom? [thunder rumbling] "Measure your life by counting the precious moments." "Your smile is a treasure to all who know you." "Your lucky numbers are 10, 42, 75, and 3." What is this? This is how you lead? Uh, spoiler alert: I'm not wise old me, am I? And if I'm being frank, my daughters are assholes! Knife fights, ridiculous eye shadow and serious, serious Mommy issues. And the worst part is, you're all I have to look forward to in my retirement. So much for backgammon and Palm Springs. Ramse, wait! Where are you going? You taught us to be willing to give our lives for each other. If you won't be a part of saving theirs, at least give them yours. [thunder rumbles] I'm coming with you. [dramatic music] There he is. Hey, hey. What are you doing? I'm going with you. No, no, if he sees us together, he's gonna know something's up. I can handle this on my own. You don't need to be here. Cole. Trust me. If something goes wrong, I'll meet you back at the hotel. Go! [suspenseful music] Reggie, hey. New drill today. I got to take you in the back. Yeah, come on. This way. ♪ What is this? Just keep walking. What'd I do, huh? ♪ [commotion] She's got a gun! What is this? You telling me you don't have any idea? Where are we going? ♪ [cocks trigger] Turn around. I'm s... You know why this has to happen. ♪ [indistinct excited chatter] Get out of here. ♪ Oh, my God! There's a woman here with a gun. [voices rising, indistinct chatter] ♪ [metal clattering] [men exclaiming] ♪ Where's my husband? Who's your husband? ♪ Put it down. You're Primary. You know what happens to you. I'm... I'm so... Turn around. [suspenseful music] I'm sorry. What? I took the money. What money? What are you talking about? The money he gave me, to act like I was afraid of you. But he drew the picture. Who is your husband? Charlie. ♪ [coughs] Baby, put that down. It's time. Take it. It hurts to hold it like this. [Cole breathing hard] You know what you're supposed to do with this. I've known my whole life. I knew it would be you from the moment I saw you. ♪ It's time. I'm ready. [breathing heavily] ♪ You're one of the 12. You're a Messenger. I was. But I won't be. Not to her. I can't hurt her. I don't want to hurt her either. Charlie. Today is the day I die. She's Primary. If you paradox her, you'll destroy everyone. Everything. Where's the other Messenger? He's dead. I'm not like them. Not everything the Witness said was true. Because when I saw you, I just... I couldn't do it. Do this... and we can live forever in the Red Forest like you said. Charlie! I'm sorry, Cole. But you of all people should understand this. [grunt and shotgun] [dramatic music] ♪ 
♪ Do you see that? [thunder rumbling] I swear to you... this wasn't here before. My God. ♪ How many days has the patient been in coma? 19. I can't believe she's still with us. Much luckier than the others. [indistinct P.A. announcement] [soft music] ♪ [whispers] Cass. I know you can't hear me. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I couldn't stop it. [exhales] The best thing that can happen now... is for you to wake up... and forget you ever knew me. ♪ [suspenseful music] Olivia : You're walking through a Red Forest. The grass is tall. It's just rained. [thunder rumbles] Most of the blood has washed away. There's a house in the distance. Cedar and pine. You've been there before. You're not alone. [dramatic music] [gasps] [clipboard clatters] We weren't sure if you'd ever wake up. You sustained quite a few injuries. The trauma to your head was... What happened? The factory. Some kind of explosion. Cole. Where's Cole? We haven't had any patients from the explosion besides you for six months. It's a miracle you're still alive. Six months? You were out for quite some time. The explosion happened in 1957. It's now 1958. [dramatic music] ♪ [background chatter] Nurse? Nurse. Sorry. You know I don't like calling you that, but until you finish those courses, I don't know what else to call you. What is it, Dr. Ed? The kid with the bug bite and the rash. I told you, it's Lyme... Look, I went through this whole book. I've called every colleague I have. Not one of them has ever heard of anything called Lyme disease or watermelon disease or potato disease either. Look, I got really good marks in Med School. The patient needs Penicillin V or he'll die. Trust me. Have I been wrong yet? ♪ Where are you right now? Someplace warm? Safe? Next to someone you love? I'll have a whisky sour. ♪ [knock on the door] Good afternoon, ma'am. The American Union representative dropped this off for you. Said to say they found an address for that name you were looking for. And who are you? Morris. Morrison. [solemn music] [grunts] Ah! Damn it! [hisses] [groans] Ah... [soft music] ♪ What are you doing here? What are you doing here? The house? It's mine. I bought it. Why this house? I was driving by, saw the "for sale" sign. It needs a lot of work. The hospital. They weren't sure if you were ever gonna wake up. But I knew you would. Why did you go? I couldn't do it. Not after. So you ran? I did what I always told you I was gonna do. I found a place for you to be happy. I mean, look around. There's no plague here. There's no Red Forest. You're safe. You can live a life. So that's it? After all of that, we just forget about the future? I don't know what else to do. I'm done trying to figure out the answer to everything. [sighs] We failed. For some reason we're still here. You being... here, doesn't make sense. I'm also done trying to make sense of everything. You should be too. You can hate me for leaving. But I did it for you. No, you didn't. You did it for you because you're afraid. [thunder rumbles] You're bleeding. It's nothing. Do you have running water at least? [chuckles] Yeah. Easy. We have to wash it first. It's not as bad as it looked. Just bled a lot. [echoing] Most of the blood has washed away. [loud thunder] What is it? [tense music] ♪ I know this room. How?

[eerie music] Olivia : There's a house in the distance. Cedar and pine. You've been there before. I've been here before. Olivia: You're not alone. There is a man. You see him. Go to him. Know him. [moving music] Olivia and Railly : Like a memory of tomorrow. They knew this place. This moment. You. What are you talking about? ♪ [metal groans] [metallic squeak] Shh! [distant '20s music] ♪ Why would you walk towards the weird music? Ramse, nothing about this place says "good idea." He's here. Keep moving. [thunder rumbles] [distant '20s music continues] ♪ Turn around! [echoing] Turn around... around... ['20s music continues] [intense musical build-up] Look outside. Time hasn't collapsed. Go. Live. For once, there's time. This isn't permanent. I still die at the CDC in 2018. You don't know that. To hell with causality. You don't have to be afraid anymore! Go live a life that's not full of fear and death. But the world will still end. I know Ramse. He wouldn't give up. He found Titan. He found the Witness. Take off the mask! [echoing] Take off the mask... mask... Take off the mask! The mask... mask... Until the world comes crashing down around our heads, we have to believe it's over. All of it. [thunder claps] ♪ I guess you really know what you're doing here. I'll leave you to it. Cassie! What? I'm leaving you alone. That's what you want. That's not why I left. Then what was it? I wanted you to be free... of me. I never asked to be free of you. You coward, you know that's not why you left me. You left me because you're in love with me. [dramatic music] I've always known, Cole. ♪ And you kept pushing me away... so that in the end you wouldn't have anything to lose. And now... you don't. [mystical music] ♪
