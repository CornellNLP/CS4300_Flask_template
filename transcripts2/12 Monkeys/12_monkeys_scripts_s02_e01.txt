 I want to tell you a story... 
 [echoing] Story... story... 
 About how the world ends... 
 [echoing] Ends... ends... 
 And the man from the future sent back through time to stop it. 
 [dramatic notes] 
 Here, in the present day, he uncovered a conspiracy: men in the shadows who sought to release a plague upon the world. 
 They call themselves the Army of the 12 Monkeys. 
 [roar] 
 But in the darkness, the man found hope: a woman, a partner. 
 Together they fought to stop the plague, but fate was not on their side... for, you see, the man also forged a bond with another, someone he considered a brother. 
 If the man were to succeed and change the future, the brother's son would never be born, so the brother turned his back on the man and joined the enemy. 
 [gunshots] 
 The woman was wounded, dying in her time, so to save her, the man sent her to his. 
 And in the end, because the woman had taught him to love, the man could not let his brother die. 
 Even though it was written, the man broke that fate and changed time. 
 Now, the time of the plague is upon us, and the man and woman are separated by oceans of time, destined to never see one another again. 
 I told you, this is the story of how the world ends, one that begins at the end and ends at the beginning... a story that, like time itself, can be changed.

 Hello, Traveler. 
 [panting] 
 You almost had me in Shanghai. 
 London too. 
 You cannot run from fate. 
 Fortunately for us, you kept poking your head aboveground. 
 [electronic beeping] 
 Let me ask you, why is the Army of the 12 Monkeys trying to kill me? 
 Because your death is preordained. 
 You served your purpose. 
 Now the plague is imminent. 
 It was your guidance that led us to the virus, and for this we're grateful. 
 But now your cycle is complete. 
 So long, Traveler.

 It's been three months.

 Or the present, depending on your point of view. 
 How long? 
 Four days.

 You... 
 Yes, crudely. 
 I'm afraid surgery is not my strong suit. 
 Well, I'm here. 
 That's something. 
 Yes, but why are you here, Dr. Railly? 
 We tracked Ramse to Project Splinter. 
 Mr. Ramse? 
 He was working for the Army of the 12 Monkeys as their advisor for decades. 
 You stopped him? 
 Cole wouldn't do it. 
 When it comes to Mr. Ramse, his judgment has always been... unreliable. 
 I shot Ramse. 
 I imagine that was quite difficult for you, being a doctor. 
 It wasn't. 
 That's good. 
 Grieving over who we were only gets in the way of who we need to become.

 They call themselves the Messengers. 
 The Twelve.

 They're part of the same organization that you have been fighting in the past. 
 They also exist here in my time. 
 What do they want? 
 My machine. 
 They want to travel through time? 
 For what, I don't know. 
 Alter history, ensure the plague... or maybe they just want to hear Hendrix at Woodstock. 
 But if they somehow manage to change something in the past, then I want to know what it is. 
 This will make it... 
 So time moves around you.

 But you walked away. 
 Just became a different man. 
 Better. 
 Sometimes that's all it takes. 
 Ramse taught me that. 
 Yeah, well, now he needs your help. 
 The 12 Monkeys... they put something in him, something that helps them find him. 
 A tracker device. Sounds like them. 
 We need you to cut it out. 
 I don't want to get involved. 
 But you will. 
 And why is that? 
 Because you owe him. 
 We owe something to the people who make us better. 
 I can treat him at my office. 
 No, he's safer underground. 
 You have to come to us. 
 Can you do it? 
 It won't be pretty.
