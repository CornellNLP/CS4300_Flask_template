 Previously on "12 Monkeys"... 
 She said I was Primary. 
 You are Primary. 
 Locked up for delusions and voices in the head. 
 That sound like anybody we know? 
 Jennifer Goines... Yes, she's crazy too. 
 She's not just crazy. She's... 
 She's what? Special? 
 We help it think Primaries. 
 Living and breathing gears in time's wristwatch. 
 Tick, tock. 
 I know why the Messengers went back in time. 
 They're destroying Primaries. 
 Collapsing time by creating paradoxes. No beginning. No end. All of humanity destroyed. We know one of the Messengers' targets. A Primary named Kyle Slade. New York City, 1970s. It's 1975 to be precise. We sent two of our Messengers there after us. Something else happen? You're walking through a red forest. We're going on another trip to see The Witness? I can't wait to tell him about how I've been taking out your Messengers. [screams] Eight down, four to go. Who are you? Aaron? You know, the skeptic in me finds it hard to believe that all this is the result of the murder of a few crazy people back in time. It's not just murder. They're paradoxing a Primary, removing a vital string in the fabric of time. It's unwinding before our eyes. This is causality driven insane. Won't be long before it will devour past, present, and future, destroying all of mankind. Hell on Earth? You're not going all Biblical on me now are you, Kat? We need to find the next Primary and stop the Messengers from destroying them. Well then, feast those beautiful eyes on this. [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ De-con chamber. You sure? ♪ ♪ Cover me. Hold it. Hold it. This is your problem. You got no plan. You rush on that hallway, naked... he's gonna get you. God damn it! [thuds] [yelling] ♪ ♪ [clicks] Got you. You're both dead. Nice job, buddy. You're supposed to be watching my back, man. You're high-fiving the enemy? Dead means no talking. Oh, man, I think I got a flesh wound. Avenge me, brother. [growling] [laughing] ♪ ♪ What? He can't play outside. We know where to find the Primary in 1975. ♪ ♪ Game over. [rubber band snaps] Is Cole going back in time again? Probably. You going with him? No. I got a more important job. You could've stopped a lot of people from dying before. And you didn't. I know you love me, but it's not just about my future. It's about everyone's. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Thanks to Dr. Railly and Ms. Goines, we have the name of another of the Messengers' victims. Kyle Slade. Died July the 2nd, 1975. Slade was a drifter. No permanent address. Believed to reside near Greenwich Village. Do we know how many Messengers were sent back to kill this guy? There are four unaccounted for and, if they are consistent, at least two assassins were sent after Mr. Slade. We believe it's these two men. Unfortunately, there's no security footage of the others. But there is something that you should know. This man, Kyle Slade, was believed to be The Immortal, a serial killer responsible for the murder and dismemberment of at least 12 people between 1974 and '75. What? Staff Sergeant Slade was dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Army after allegedly butchering several Viet Cong soldiers. I'm supposed to protect this guy? How you prevent him from being paradoxed... that's up to you. How do I find him? Victoria Mason, The Immortal's 12th and final victim... The only one police could identify. The rest were indigents. Murdered July 2nd, 1975. Oof! Same day Slade's body was found. In other words, paradoxed. So I splinter in before he finds Victoria? You follow her to Slade, wait till the Messengers come, and we take him out. We? You're all leap, no look, little brother. You're gonna get yourself killed. My hero. It's either that or Jonesey sends me back in time to save your ass again. You're crazy about me. Just admit it. What about the girl? I strongly recommend not getting involved. You mean let her die? I mean don't alter time any more than we already have. ♪ ♪ The temporal scanners have been recalibrated. I can put you at the proper coordinates within seconds of each other. July 1st, 1975. With that hair, you're gonna fit right in. Just try and stay out of traffic this time. You got to be kidding me. Initiate splinter sequence. [Foghat's "Slow Ride" playing] ♪ Slow ride ♪ 
♪ Take it easy ♪

♪ ♪ You are a real pain in the ass. Ow! Sedatives for a concussion? My malpractice case against you is growing by leaps and bounds. You need to rest so you can recover. Ooh, so warm. Nope, not sleepy. You know, as a former CEO of a major biotech company, I'm used to certain amenities. This place is old, and it smells. It smells like old. Probably haunted. ♪ ♪ It's definitely haunted. You know, some people think that ghosts are just replays. Traumatic events recorded into their surroundings... [grunts] [crunch] Into time. And there are the sedatives. You don't believe in ghosts, do you? [dramatic music] I don't. You got to open your mind, Doc, before someone opens it for you. ♪ ♪ [chattering] Coffee's not bad.

It's New York City, man. Everything's fun if you're doing it right. [scoffs] I know that look. What look? The look that says you're about to father another child and change the course of history.

[Screaming] Oh, sh1t. That's our Primary. Jesus Christ, that's the guy we're supposed to protect? This is me looking and not leaping. This sitting right with you? I don't like it any more than you do. It's how it has to be. We go changing things now, we're gonna make it worse. We don't want to be here any longer than we have to. We or you?

So you guys came here from the future to stop some guy from killing me in order to stop the guys who are trying to kill him? Okay, that is some "Twilight Zone" sh1t right there. Maybe honesty's not the best policy here. What about my son? Safer with your mother. You're safer here. At least until we find the Messengers. What are you doing? You're a mother. Stay off of this sh1t. Yeah? Look who's talking. It's a side effect from changing time. [scoffs] Why, because you saved me? You just got a second chance. Try not to waste it. All the cocaine she's been doing... She's gonna be dead in a month. Little kid is better off. The last person who should be passing judgment on parenting is you. You better watch your mouth. [funk music playing in distance] What happened, happened. Kyle's still out there somewhere. We got to get to him before they do. All we got is his name, and we know what he looks like. That's it. Cops. We give them the name. Let them find him. Piggy-back off them. I mean they have to look into it. They're the cops. Not in this time period... Too much corruption. Then we'll have to blend in. Thank you. Not a problem. You're the guys from the "Times"? That's right. Detective Damato. This is Franklin. Bill Margolis. This is my associate, Ethan Seki. Why don't you step into our office? [sighs] So? You said you had some information on The Immortal. We know who he is. That so? And how exactly do a couple of newshounds come upon this information? Can't tell you. Have to protect our sources. So who is he? Kyle Slade. Vietnam vet. Did three tours. Came home last year. Two weeks before you found your first victim. All right, pallies. We'll look into it. We want a ride-along. Be there when you grab him. That way we get our exclusive. No way. Can't have a couple of ink-stained dipshits tagging along on a serial murder collar. Thanks for the tip. Oh, and you guys have yourselves a beautiful day, huh? How about a peek at the future? Got an article here I wrote. Goes to press in an hour. "NYPD Bungles Serial Homicide Case." Our names are all over this. What, are you assholes trying to blackmail us? Just trying to help you catch a killer. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ All right, if we give you this exclusive, this gets spiked, or you do. ♪ ♪ DOD just sent this over.

He slaughtered his captors using a machete to hack off their limbs. ♪ ♪ According to his psychologist, Slade said that voices in the jungle told him to do it. Declared Section 8.

All available units report to the scene. [sirens blaring] [indistinct radio chatter] [indistinct commands] Officer Rollins? I spotted your suspect moving west on Lincoln. When I approached he ran into this store. Took the cashier hostage. Anyone else in there? Don't think so. He's threatening to kill her if we don't leave the scene. Call HNT. We need a negotiator. And get ESU down here. Better reach out to the Mayor's office too. We don't need any more blow-back. Hey, Cole! Hey, get back here! God damn it! Hey! ♪ ♪ [bell dings] Take one more step! Easy. [woman whimpering] I'm here to help you, Kyle. How do you know my name? I know all about you. I know you're Primary... and I know last night a man from the future tried to kill you. The Messenger? ♪ ♪ It's you. James Cole. ♪ ♪ Why don't you put that gun down so we can talk, all right? [woman whimpering] ♪ ♪ [bell dings] [whimpering] Go! Go! Back it up! Got to keep the whole street clear! We're coming out. You'll be safe in jail, Kyle. They can't get to you. I've been waiting for you, Cole. I can take you to The Witness now. The Witness? The one who gave birth to The Army of the 12 Monkeys. You want him, I've got him. Go! Go! Move! Where is he? I can take you right now, but we don't have time. Where is he, Kyle... Hey! We don't have time for this! Kyle, tell me where he is! Kyle! sh1t heel, hey, back off. I need to talk to him. Put him in our car. Thanks for the tip, Serpico, but your exclusive ends here. Hey, asshole, we need to speak to him. I've got the itching for a real nice obstruction charge for you two. I'll see you soon. He knows where The Witness is. What are you talking about? Cole? Don't do that. Don't do that! Get in. That's a cop car. [engine turns over] Oh, I'm an idiot. Oh, I'm an idiot. [dramatic music] 
 
 How is this possible? They rescued me from the fire. Nursed me back to health. Don't worry, she's safe. I'm not the enemy, Cass, and neither are they. Aaron? We're all fighting the same war, just on different fronts. These people, they have powers beyond our understanding. Without them, I'd be dead. Without them... none of this would have happened. Not the plague, not the fire. Not Cole. You betrayed us. Everything I did was... You did for me, I know. I know. I wish to God that you'd stayed out of it. I thought I was gonna die in that fire. I was just waiting for the pain to stop. ♪ ♪ In those final moments, the only thing I saw was you, Cass. You were the only thing that kept me going and the worst part was thinking that I was gonna die without ever getting the chance to tell you... That I'm sorry. ♪ ♪ [sirens wailing] [tires squealing] Sons of bitches! Guns down! On the ground, now! You want to tell me what the hell you're doing? Get in the car. You too. You're in some real sh1t, paperboy. Shut up. Don't look at me. Get in the car. [dramatic music] Cole, our mission... is to protect the Primary. What are you doing? Kyle, you take me to him? Bronx River Avenue. I can show you. Hold on... Hold on? It's The Witness, the guy behind the apocalypse, the anomalies. If he's here, we have to find him. Cole, this guy... he jerks off in his basement and he thinks about hacking off limbs. You want to trust him now? If there's even a chance we can find The Witness I have to take it. We could end this thing right now. Not by going off half-cocked! I got a kid. Really? I haven't heard that before. You're just as crazy as this piece of sh1t. Idiot, you don't listen. You never listen! You're all leap, no look. You remember? This was always my mission, not yours. Cole! [sirens wailing] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Who did this? Him! Traveler. How'd you find us? Your friend left something at the cafe. He's with the Primary now? Yeah, your boss... he's in deep sh1t. The Witness? Mm-hmm. If that's true you were wise not to follow him, Traveler. [grunting] ♪ ♪ 1975 is as good a year as any to die, Traveler. ♪ ♪ [grunting] [clanks] Aah! ♪ ♪ [groans] [panting] All right, you okay? Yeah. I need to borrow your car keys. You need to get the hell out of here. Look at me. You go home, you take care of your boy. Your life ain't about you anymore. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Let's go. They said I was crazy in 'Nam. Said that's what the jungle does to a man. I knew. The war wasn't over there, it was here. That how you justify butchering innocent people? I didn't have a choice. Those people were just like me. They could hear the voices. [suspenseful music] You saying they were Primary? The Witness wants to take them out, bring down this whole house of cards. You can't paradox them if they're already dead. What about the waitress, Victoria? She wasn't Primary. It was a means to an end. I didn't want to hurt her, but a soldier's got to make tough choices, you know. You've heard of Cyrus the Great, King of Persia? No. He had an army. "The Immortals." Warriors willing to do whatever it took no matter how brutal. It meant no attachments. No wives, no kids, nothing. Just the battle. Like us. What battle? There's only one true enemy in this world: time itself. I know you feel it, too, Cass. Hanging over you like a shadow. All those years as a doctor, how much suffering have you witnessed? How many people have you seen slip away before their time? What do you want from me, Aaron? I want you to understand. It doesn't have to be that way anymore. There's only one way to undo the clock, Cass. The Witness is destroying people like me, the ones that keep time from falling in on itself, but we can't hold it up forever. Someday Atlas is gonna shrug. And when that day comes, this whole city is gonna turn into a ghost town. I've seen it. Seen what? The forest of blood. It was like hell on Earth. It's beautiful. A place where time no longer exists. A place where you can be with the one you love forever. What could be more important than that? No. No, it can't be that way. It's the only way. Don't you understand? The Red Forest is the only way to beat death. The Witness wants to be immortal in his timeless forest, but can you imagine destroying time itself, so everything that's left is living and dying in the same moment? An eternal now? Everything you've ever known, anyone that you've ever loved. There's no future, no past. Forever red. ♪ ♪ The Witness is here. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Careful. For any curious cats. Come on. ♪ ♪ What'd I tell you? The Witness in the flesh. ♪ ♪ He came for me, but I was smarter. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [clangs] Careful. Careful! This has to be done right.

[siren wailing] ♪ ♪ He's from there too, you know. The future. The Witness is a Traveler just like you. He's been doing it far, far longer. He's got abilities. Technology way beyond yours. He can get inside your head... But he's just a man. And a man can be killed. [tires screech] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [electricity crackling, whirring] [grunts] You see this? He came here to kill me with this. His dagger made of bone. It's my bone that they dig up in the future. ♪ ♪ Cole, you have to kill The Witness with this. Time wants you to do it. It needs you to do it. It has to be you. I've seen you before. You're not The Witness. ♪ ♪ Ow. ♪ ♪ You're not Aaron. No. You're The Witness. Perhaps I have chosen the wrong way to convince you. ♪ ♪ This? This is the face you prefer? ♪ ♪ [whirring] [panting] [chattering] There you are, birthday girl. One too many Bombay Breezes for this one. Okay, let's get you back to the room before you ralph all over the marble. You okay? Sleepwalk much? I found you down here going full Nell. What's going on? The Witness was here. He's a Messenger. The other one. They come in pairs. They're like hit men sent through time to take out people like you. You're wrong. I'm too important. The Witness wanted to do me personally, but I saw him coming, just like I knew that you would come here. Do it! ♪ ♪ Do it! God! Come on! ♪ ♪ Take the dagger, and kill The Witness. It is why I brought you here. It is your fate to do this! [gun cocks] [whistles] [whimpers] Hey, Cole, let's do both of these guys, get the hell out of here. What's he doing here? Easy, we're all on the same side. Are we? 'Cause I am seriously starting to doubt your commitment, man. ♪ ♪ Put your gun down. You first. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[electricity buzzes] [all scream] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [coughs] [groans] [both grunting] You're not worthy. [gagging] [dramatic music] [gunshot] ♪ ♪ [rifle cocking] ♪ ♪ You're not worthy. You're just like the others. You were meant to protect me. Only from a paradox. I'm The Immortal. I'm not supposed to die. Everybody dies. You're not safe here anymore, especially around me. You need to find someplace else to stay for a while. Someplace I don't know about. If The Witness can find me, he can find you too. Okay, please know that I appreciate the irony of what I'm about to say, but what if it was all in your head? We can't take that chance. It felt real. Then if it was real... that means he's scared, right? Of us! I mean, whatever we're doing is working, right? We have to go monkey hunting. Okay, what's the natural predator of the monkey?

He told me he wants to destroy time... So there'd be no more death. He made it sound almost beautiful. ♪ ♪ Well, it's not. Death is like... everything. It's a time clock that makes us better. Makes us love harder. I don't know, I think it's, like, maybe... what makes us human. ♪ ♪ Preventing the paradox has caused the temporal storms to recede. You reversed some of the damage. What's that mean? It means you did good, son. I was out for blood back there. I know I almost got you killed. I just thought we could get him, so... I did what I always do, rush in. Anyway, I'm sorry. It's all right. ♪ ♪ I used to think you were insane. I realized it's something else, right? Something in here. Never gonna change and it shouldn't. I think one of these days, it's gonna help us out of this mess. Until then, somebody's got to have your back. [rock music] Listen, man, you know I love you. Oh, what are you doing? What? You don't say that. Say what? You never say that. No, I was gonna say I love whisky, and we should go find some and drink it. No you weren't... You were gonna declare your undying love for me, brother. Don't flatter yourself, okay? I heard you. You're emotional right now. I heard that happens to new parents. Listen, I'm not being emotional. You're being an asshole, okay? ♪ ♪ Me too. Jennifer? ♪ ♪ [electricity buzzes]  [clock chimes out of tune] ♪ ♪ [thunder rumbles] [gasps] [gasps]
