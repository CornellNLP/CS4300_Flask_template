 Cole : Previously on  12 Monkeys... 
 Daughters shall make from 12... an army! 
 12 is not primary. 
 Cole : All this traveling through time, it's killing me, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 How many jumps have I got left? 
 Not as many as I'd like. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 'Cause you're important. 
 He has plans for you. 
 Jose, this is Sam, your son. 
 Hello. 
 You got to stop. 
 I watched her die. 
 The mission is all that matters now. 
 You're not erasing my son. 
 Get it through your head. There is no future. 
 Your son's already dead. 
 Dr. Adler : It's been 72 hours since we got the new core from Spearhead. 
 Splinter sequence 44 Alpha was successful. 
 Mr. Cole is now in 2015. 
 The new core is functioning at maximum capacity. 
 Recalibrating tracer scan for return.

 [clattering, thunking] 
 What are you doing with those? 
 Jones needs it. 
 She sent you? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you lying to me, Mr. Ramse? 
 Yeah. 
 [rain falling, thunder rumbles] 
 I got it. Skydiving. 
 I don't know. It's kind of played. 
 Are you serious? Have you ever jumped out of a plane? 
 They strap you to instructors. 
 I don't like it. 
 Okay. 
 Rock climbing? 
 Mm. 
 Hang off a 500-foot cliff by ropes and those little metal key chains? 
 Okay, they're called carabiners, first of all. 
 You know that. 
 When did we become such adrenaline junkies? 
 Filling the void. 
 Here we go. 
 What do you think? 
 Perfect.

 [door closes] 
 No, no, no. 
 No, you can't be here. 
 Nice to see you too. 
 It's not over? 
 No, it's not. 
 You're alive. 
 So are you. 
 The virus is still out there. 
 12 Monkeys got their hands on it somehow. 
 But we destroyed M5-10 in Chechnya. 
 We burned it, all of it. 
 The CIA has satellite photos that prove that. 
 The Night Room is destroyed. The Remains, the origin is gone. 
 Leland is dead. 
 We missed something. 
 We? No, you. 
 You missed something. 
 Aaron : How is this still happening? 
 Because it was never just Leland. 
 There's Oliver Peters. 
 He was at the CIA during Operation Troy. 
 He gave them the virus. 
 We need to find him. 
 Langley barely let us off the hook last time. 
 We can't open that up again. 
 Aaron, we have to. 
 Why? 
 Look, I know this is hard for you to understand... 
 No, I get it. The world is ending. 
 You're a time traveler who doesn't know what he's doing. 
 Back off. 
 You got her killed. 
 And then I got her back. 
 Yeah, how many times are you gonna be able to do that? 
 How many times does she have to die before you figure your sh1t out? 
 Cole. 
 You don't know, do you? 
 Stop it. 
 You're right about one thing. 
 The future's pretty bleak if you're all they got. 
 The fact that he's here again... 
 You have no idea how to stop this. 
 [coughing] 
 This is the last address the CDC has on Peters. 
 It's not a Markridge property. 
 Cassie : Checked. 
 So... what happens now? 
 I don't know. 
 At least before, I had hope that we could beat this. 
 Yeah, well, nothing stays the same. 
 I went looking for you in Chechnya. 
 I know you did. 
 What happened? 
 I ever tell you about Ramse? 
 You grew up together on the outside. 
 You're like brothers. 
 You look worried. 
 I am. 
 [sighs] 
 [sniffs] Whoa. 
 [groans] 
 No, it's okay. I know what that is. 
 The petals... that's how I found Jeremy. 
 What's with our Tall Man and flowers? 
 He uses them to mask the smell of death. 
 Cassie : It's an old plague trick. 
 [flies buzzing] 
 That's not Peters. 
 It's his husband. 
 Peters is gone. 
 They must've gotten to him first. 
 And his hard drive. 
 We destroyed the virus, but not the man who made it. 
 [sighs] We haven't changed anything. 
 [groans] 
 Are you okay? 
 [sniffs] Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Proust...  Remembrance of Things Past. 
 He had this with him at the CIA. 
 If you have something that you know other people want, what do you do? 
 Hide it. 
 Peters' private journal. 
 What is all that? 
 Recipe for a plague.

 [Blue Oyster Cult's  Don't Fear the Reaper] 
 ♪ 
 It's that thing from the Night Room. 
 The "Annapurna Remains." 
 His notes say it was excavated from the Himalayas in the '80s. 
 That's where the virus was born thousands of years ago. 
 What's this? 
 It's Japanese. 
 Tokyo. White Dragon. 
 Wexler told me about this place. 
 He knew about the 12 Monkeys. 
 They're connected to this place somehow. 
 1987... that's the date Leland Goines said he met me before. 
 But that hasn't happened for you yet. 
 No, but it will. 
 [scoffs] 
 I think this is it. This is where it all started. 
 We found it. 
 Good for us. 
 Listen, this is the only connection we have to Peters. 
 I need you to help me find him, Cassie. 
 [chuckles] 
 It'll be my pleasure. 
 I don't think that's helping you. 
 If Peters is recreating M5-10 for the 12 Monkeys, he'll need animals to test it on. 
 CDC can get a list of suppliers, and then I'll be able to track him down. 
 Just like the Big Burn and the Night Room. 
 Then splinter, apocalypse, rinse, repeat. 
 Hey, what is this? 
 What are you doing? 
 You're not supposed to be here. 
 You think I want to be? 
 Go. I'll find Peters. 
 See you soon. 
 Maybe. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Do you think I haven't noticed the nosebleeds, the headaches? 
 All this splintering is killing you, isn't it? 
 I'm gonna be fine, okay? 
 [rumbling] 
 [machine whirring] 
 [power up whine] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 I know where Leland Goines got the origin of the virus... 
 Tokyo... 
 November 21, 1987, a nightclub called the White Dragon. 
 What is it? 
 How could he do this? 
 [groaning] 
 Ugh... [thud] 
 James. 
 Were you followed? 
 A couple of scavs a mile back. 
 Where are they now? 
 Okay... 
 Glad you're back. 
 Elena was worried. 
 Where is she? 
 Thank God. 
 Hey, you. 
 When Cole gets back, they're finished. 
 They're not going to be splintering anymore. 
 I wrecked the place pretty good. 
 And I got this. 
 What is that? 
 They put it in his blood before he goes in the machine. 
 Without it, he can't go back. 
 They're gonna come for that. 
 If they find us, we have insurance. 
 But if they get that back, they'll just try again. 
 They'll stop the plague, make it so that we never meet. 
 Sam is never born. 
 Hey... we're gonna be long gone. 
 They ain't gonna find us. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 You have to trust me. 
 I'm gonna fix it. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 man : Incoming! Southeast corner! 
 Scavs. 
 We got a caravan coming! 
 Stay here. 
 Be careful. 
 [man shouting orders] 
 That didn't take them long. 
 It's not them. 
 The Daughters. 
 At least that's what they call themselves. 
 Nomads. All women. 
 Blame men for the apocalypse. 
 Hard to argue there. 
 [horse whinnies] 
 Tough crew... surviving out in the open all this time. 
 Well, it seems like they don't know we're here. 
 Let's keep it that way. 
 Costa : What is it? 
 Nothing. 
 sh1t. 
 Dr. Railly with the D.C. office. 
 I'm looking for a list of test-animal suppliers, but my expertise is in clinical virology, not zoonosis. 
 Right, so the best test subjects? 
 Macaques. 
 [chuckles] 
 Monkeys... of course. 
 Your condition is worsening. 
 The splinter process has deteriorated your body further than I anticipated. 
 What is that thing? 
 It's a reconditioning system for molecular stabilization. 
 It won't reverse the damage, but it will keep you together a while longer. 
 I don't need it. 
 Come on, let's fire up the Beast one last time. 
 1987, the White Dragon. 
 You will die trying. 
 [groans] 
 You find Ramse? 
 Do you know where he might be? 
 Maybe. 
 Tell me. 
 I'll send Mr. Whitley. 
 It should be me. 
 You have to take this treatment now. 
 We'll take care of Mr. Ramse. 
 He's just trying to protect Elena and his kid. 
 At this point, we cannot let your friendship stand in the way of this mission. 
 Where's Ramse? 
 Tell me he won't get hurt. 
 Why would that matter if you are successful? 
 Because getting Ramse killed can't be the last thing I do here. 
 You have my word. 
 Ramse is likely at the old park, out west. 
 Half a mile north of the highway. 
 I know the place. 
 Those injections... it's our last supply. 
 We don't have any material to make more. 
 But we also need Cole's continued cooperation. 
 So that means Ramse... stays alive. 
 That might not be so easy. 
 I didn't say it was easy. 
 You know, anything we do, even if we undo it, it happened nonetheless... in God's eyes. 
 That sounds like Foster. 
 You getting superstitious on me? 
 I don't think that God's wrath requires my belief. 
 What if I have to choose? Injections or Ramse? 
 We need those injections. 
 [glass clatters] 
 [guns cocking] 
 I don't want any trouble. 
 I just have a few questions. 
 That symbol. 
 The face. 
 I know it. 
 It's from before. 
 Army of the 12 Monkeys? 
 Is that you? 
 
 
 
 [footsteps, wood creaking] 
 [woman chuckles] 
 12's not primary. 
 You feeling okay? 
 Well, it turns out Scotch doesn't stop the apocalypse. 
 Why am I here, Cass? 
 I didn't know he was coming back, Aaron. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 Not follow him blindly. 
 I'm not following him blindly. 
 Cass, after everything that's happened to you... kidnapped. Killed. Unkilled... 
 That's not gonna happen again. 
 It is gonna happen again. 
 It's gonna happen over and over again. 
 Listen to me. 
 If Cole is right... you and I don't have a future. 
 Cass. 
 I can do this alone, but I don't want to.

 Don't make them like you anymore.

 Pictures in your head you can't erase. 
 Hmm. 
 They don't work unless the leaves are red. 
 And they're not red unless he's been there. 
 Why don't you tell me about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? 
 Monkeys? [chuckles] 
 No. 
 No monkeys here. 
 Who are you? 
 old Jennifer : We're the Daughters... of mothers and midnight. 
 And fathers. 
 It's all out of order. 
 But there's still time for you and me. 
 We have work to finish. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What work? 
 All kinds. 
 Undo what I've done. You've done. 
 What Cole's done. 
 You know Cole? 
 Cole. 
 Cole. 
 Eyes that see. 
 Poor Otter Eyes. Can't stop the plague. 
 No. Can't undo that. 
 You know who started it? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 There's only one who truly knows. 
 Sees. 
 Did see. Will see. 
 The Witness. 
 How do I find him? 
 Tell me where Cole is and I'll give you what you need. 
 Cole's gone. I don't know where. 
 How do you know what I need? 
 [giggles] 
 Take it. 
 It's yours. 
 You're gonna need it later. 
 You're a good friend. 
 Not yet. But you will be. 
 Wait. There's something you need to know. 
 Open up. 
 Today... something happens that will change things for you... 
 man : Where's Ramse's bag? Where does he keep his stuff? 
 old Jennifer : Not everything is preordained... no matter how it may seem. 
 Hey. 
 sh1t! 
 You can't be here. 
 These people have done nothing. 
 old Jennifer : They say things happen for a reason... [scoffs] that is a lie. 
 Stop. Stop it! 
 [overlapping shouting] 
 [gunshot] 
 Oh! 
 old Jennifer : Death can be both cause and effect. 
 That's how it works. 
 No straight lines.

 Always. 
 I gotta do something. 
 And I gotta go away for a little bit. 
 Okay? 
 But I promise you, I'm gonna come back. 
 Promise. 
 Take care of him. 
 [low pulsating synthesized strings] 
 ♪ 
 It was an accident! 
 I made it right! 
 Really? 
 Is she alive again? 
 Those injections are essential for this mission! 
 They may be essential. But I'm not going after Ramse. 
 With whatever time is left, he should be a father to that boy. 
 You know, you're right about one thing. 
 Someone... someday... will judge us for what we've done. 
 Cassie : All right, so the trail of 25 Pagai Island macaques that I tracked from Sumatra to Guam to Panama goes cold right here. 
 And that matters why? 
 Because these particular monkeys are perfect for viral cloning. 
 And it's the only shipment of its kind for the last two months, Could be a coincidence, but I doubt it. 
 We're looking for one of these numbers. 
 [rain pattering on car roof] 
 Ready? 
 Okay. 
 You check out that row of containers. 
 I'll start on that side, and we'll meet in the middle. 
 Hey, be careful.

 The virus. Where is it? 
 [laughs] 
 It's done. It's gone. 
 It... it's... it's completed. 
 How? 
 It wasn't hard. 
 A simple matter of reconstituting from the DNA I sequenced at Markridge. 
 Why would you do this? 
 For Jason. 
 They said if I didn't finish the job, that they would... 
 Where are they taking the virus? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. They wouldn't say. 
 They just kept... they kept talking about the... the Messengers. 
 The 12. 
 It's part of their plan. 
 The 12. 
 Who are they, Oliver? Tell me. 
 Jason's dead, isn't he? 
 Jason's dead. 
 What I know... even if you stopped them, I could just make it again. 
 I'm too dangerous alive. 
 Please. 
 Please.

 Stay off main roads. 
 Do not try to leave the country.

 Aaron : Who are you? 
 We haven't met. 
 You're one of them. 
 I want you to listen to me.

 Down to the gate! Double quick! 
 Adler, we have to revive him. 
 I'm going to start the splinter process. 
 We have to send him back to 1987 now. 
 Do not let him get involved. 
 Max, what's going on? 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 Mr. Cole, the effects have not worn off yet. 
 Cole, I will go check it out. 
 Bring the core to full power. 
 We'll have to augment every conduit for a jump this far. 
 Input coordinates. 
 Double check. There's no margin for error here.

 Huh? 
 This is all over. 
 It ends today.

 Move. 
 Ramse, it's me. 
 Leave! 
 Now! 
 I can't do that. 
 What do you mean you can't? 
 Ramse, I want the same thing you do. 
 A better life, okay? 
 For all of us. 
 She took Elena from me. 
 I'm not gonna let you take my son. 
 She succeeds in this mission, he's gone. 
 Maybe he'll have a better future. 
 I'm his father. 
 "Maybe"... not good enough! 
 Tell me, Mr. Ramse. 
 The love that you feel for your son, can you imagine that a thousand fold? 
 A billion. 
 Just think of the loss across the world that hit parent after parent. 
 Hannah. 
 That's your little girl. 
 The plague took her from you. 
 That's what this is for you. 
 The plague happened. 
 My son is the future. 
 Your daughter, she's the past. 
 Do it. 
 Do it.

 I can't do it now. 
 I'll do it then.

 Don't let him go. 
 Hey.

 Send me back. 
 Jones : No! Don't! 
 Ramse! 
 [groans] Uhh... 
 [music] 
 You really think Peters will be able to outrun the 12 Monkeys? 
 He's a genius. He'll figure it out. 
 Maybe you should have left the gun with him. 
 Let him do it. 
 It's too late to stop him from making the virus. 
 That damage is done. 
 I think that's enough. 
 Okay. 
 But he's not innocent. 
 He thought he was saving his husband. 
 But he still made a choice. 
 And I get it. 
 You do? 
 Helping to destroy the world to save just one person? 
 One person that you love. 
 In the end, isn't that all that matters? 
 No. 
 Where is he? 
 Your jump to 1987 was pre-programmed. 
 But with the serum so freshly administered, it's very difficult to say where he might've landed. 
 Why can't you just bring him back? 
 He was never synchronized. We have no tracer signal. 
 His trip was one way. 
 [teeth chattering] 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 This treatment was a temporary solution for your condition. 
 It just gives us one more jump. 
 James... we are out of time. 
 1987 is the endgame. 
 You must find the source of the plague and you must eliminate it. 
 James... if Mr. Ramse survives the jump, he's going to try and stop you. 
 And when he does, I'm gonna kill him. 
 [rumbling] 
 Ah!
