 Previously on "12 Monkeys"... 
 You sore about us? I trained her to survive. 
 Dr. Eckland, you were not a part of my original reality. 
 Well, that's gonna make it awkward when you come to bed. 
 You like that I wasn't intimidated by you. 
 The Witness is a traveler. He's got abilities. 
 Technology beyond yours. 
 We're going on another trip to see The Witness? 
 You're walking through a red forest. You're The Witness. Perhaps this is the face you prefer? [suspenseful music] [gasps] ♪ ♪ [upbeat music] Open the gate! ♪ ♪ 
♪ I go with you to the moon ♪ 
♪ And back, but, darling, that's a long ♪ 
♪ Way to fly ♪ Hey, what's with the dogs? Oh, they're tripling everything up. Testing that new experimental equipment. What is it supposed to do? It's a blender. How the hell am I supposed to know? I got the same clearance as you, asshole. All right, y'all gonna love this. Jacks... read them and weep, you schmucks. Queens. sh1t. You know, you keep this up I'm gonna win that brand-new Chevy you keep bragging about. Whatever, man, you... [static on radio] [electricity buzzing] [bangs] What the hell was that? [dogs barking] Why's there no alarm? What happened to the generator? ♪ Baby, I'll crash my daddy's car ♪ [electronic whirring] ♪ Just to kill ♪ ♪ Your sweet ♪ 
♪ Heart ♪ [ominous tones] ♪ ♪ [traffic noises] [clock ticking] [ghostly whispering] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] ♪ ♪ [electricity crackles] [soothing piano music] Only the Germans would invent a card game where the rules change halfway through. Where I come, we just call it cheating. That's because you're losing. So, I'm a loser? Yes. [laughs] You're a loser. You say the sweetest things. Not on purpose. I'd hate to give you the wrong idea. Oh, that must happen to you a lot. People mistaking your overwhelming warmth and affection for romantic intent. Explains the way Dr. Adler looks at you. What? Dr. Adler? [both laugh] Do you think you would have married again? If the world hadn't gone to sh1t? I prefer to correct my mistakes, not repeat them. Hey, where's the fun in that? Where would we be if we were scared away by a little failure? Not in my bed, that's for certain. [alarm ringing] The machine's powering up. Who's coming through? Doctor Railly. [dramatic music] [yells] [electronic fizzling] Doctor Railly. Doctor Railly, can you hear me? [suspenseful music] [muffled] Dr. Railly. Damn. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [muffled] Cassie. Cassie, you all right? Cassie. I saw him. You saw who? ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ It took me forever, but it's the entire facility. Dr. Eckland found me the blueprints. See they put the Time Machine and the Core at opposite ends so if one explodes, it won't destroy the other. And check this out. When the army build this place in the 1950s, they put this part over the underground river. We use it to cool the Core conduits. And you built this whole thing yourself? That is impressive. I got you some guys. Where do you want to put them? The Splinter Chamber. [sentimental music] ♪ ♪ [imitating Jones] Initiate Splinter Sequence. You sound exactly like her. [whooshes] Where'd he go? Nobody knows. [laughter] Cassie's back. You should hear this. I'll be back. It was The Witness. I'm sure of it. How do you know for sure? I could feel it. Hold up... "The Witness?" He appeared in the form of Aaron Marker, your ex. So are you sure you didn't just imagine... It wasn't a hallucination. He chose to appear as Aaron, and no, I'm not crazy. It happened. Does this sound even remotely possible? Yeah, there's some pretty trippy sh1t going on with that tea. They would, uh, drink it, and they would see him in their heads. I never tried it. Wasn't what I was there for. If it's the same hallucinogenic Ms. Goines consumes, it is possible. Could be a method of communication. It's properties allow your consciousness to drift outside time. Mental time-travel. Sign me up. I told you it wasn't a hallucination. It was real. He touched my hands. I could feel it. He was there and then he... he... he splintered. He splintered? The Witness has always been one step ahead of us. It's possible he could move through time. He doesn't have a time machine. If he did, he wouldn't need Elliot Jones to build him that one. He could have easily just sent the Messengers back in time himself. But time is broken. Causality's in flux. It's possible that what I've always feared is true. His capabilities are equal to our own. We made progress against them. We stopped the paradox in '75, slowed the red anomalies outside. Temporarily. Yeah, but I bet it pissed him off too. We should be ready for a counter move. Agreed. Dr. Railly? [suspenseful music] [clears throat] To what purpose do you believe The Witness contacted  you? ♪ ♪ I think... I think... that he... All right, I think the good doctor here could probably use some rest. ♪ ♪ The blood is washed away. [sinister music] Go to him. A memory of tomorrow. ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [whispers] ♪ ♪ Hello? ♪ ♪ [clattering] Hey, what are you doing? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [screams] [pants] ♪ ♪ Thought you were getting some rest. So did I. Yeah, it's always tough to sleep after a splinter. Kind of messes with your clock. That's a joke. [laughs softly] You ever see weird things when you splinter? Yeah, all the time. Colors, lights, memories. You ever see a person? Person? No. Who did you see? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Listen, this, uh, thing with you and Deacon... I get it. What? I know you guys went through a lot when you first came here, and, uh, I don't have to like the guy to see that he cares about you. I just want you to know doesn't bother me. I didn't think it did. Right, I... I don't even know why I said that. [whispers] It's okay. I guess we don't really know each other like we used to. ♪ ♪ [thunder rumbles] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I want to check the time-stream data... ♪ ♪ For when Dr. Railly was in the hotel in 2016. ♪ ♪ [grunting] Do you believe what she says? Look for bursts of radiation... ♪ ♪ Splinter signatures... ♪ ♪ Anything that might indicate there was another time traveler ♪ ♪ The blood has washed away. Go to him. The memory of tomorrow. ♪ ♪ [breathing unsteady] [sinister music] ♪ ♪ [screeching] ♪ ♪ [whirring] [dramatic music] We found something. What is it? Some sort of pentaquark signature. Another tether? Anchored where? Here, to this facility, now. Impossible. Recalibrate the machine and run a test sequence. [dramatic music] [whirring] ♪ ♪ This phantom tether is still here. It's almost as if... As if what, Dr. Adler? [electronic whining] Shut it down! I can't. What do you mean? It's overloading. Too much power. Why? [whooshing] The machines are overloading splinter radiation. Disengage from the Core! I can't. Not responding. Power down, now. All emergency protocols. ♪ ♪ They've been disabled. There is no way to stop... [crashing and whirring] [dramatic music] [whirring] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Sam! ♪ ♪ [sinister moaning] [alarm blaring] [dramatic music] Jones, what's happening? Get back. The machine is overloading. Some pull the lens array. I'm on it. [on loudspeaker] Evacuate the chamber. Come on. Go, go. [on loudspeaker] The machine is unstable. [alarm blaring] Shut off that damn alarm! Hey, you okay? I need you to follow me close, okay? Come on. This was no accident. The fail safes were disabled. This was deliberate. The lens array is totally fried. Someone put it in backwards. Instead of focusing the temporal stream, it dispersed it. [rumbling] [dramatic music] Without the lens array to focus the accelerator beam, the machine is going to continue to bleed splinter radiation throughout the facility. The machine is locked into random sequences. The mainframe's Core is frozen. I can't access it from here. [groans] Doctor... [dramatic music] [grunts] Jones. Doctor... you did this to me. [gasping for air] The machine... you... you put me in there. ♪ ♪ [gurgling] Oh! [struggling] [gunshot] [grunts] What the hell is that thing? An early volunteer. He called himself Marshal. Volunteer? A scavenger we put in the machine. A test subject before you. That was five years ago. The machine did that to him? Before we perfected our tether. He was lost in the time-stream. How is he here? This explosion of temporal energy from the machine must have splintered him here. Well, if that's the case, what else from the time-stream might be in here with us? [dramatic music] [whispers] Hold on. [suspenseful music] What is that? [growling] I don't know. If I say run... You be ready. [eerie music] It was sabotage. Someone with intimate knowledge of how our machine works is trying to create a temporal meltdown. Meltdown? Why? It would destroy the facility and create a chain reaction which would be catastrophic to the time-stream. The Witness. That's what he told me he wanted to do... to destroy time itself. This is his counterstrike. The Witness is here. [dramatic music] I thought it was in my head, but it... What did you see? In the corridor, I saw a man in a kind of plague doctor mask. It was him. I know it. That could explain the phantom tether that Dr. Adler discovered. All right, first thing's first. We need to stop the meltdown. I'm gonna go shut down the Core manually. I'm going with you. Hey, hey, hey. Maybe you should stay here. It's safer. I'll be fine. We can replace the lens array. Our old one is in the east warehouse. The one that burned out our first Core? But that's all we've got right now. I'll go with Mr. Deacon. That's not happening. I'll go. Dr. Eckland, your chivalry... Chivalry my ass, Kat. If anything happens to you, we're all screwed. [dramatic music] I'm a pacifist. You're sh1tting me. ♪ ♪ How do you know it was The Witness? Because I've seen him before. After the Night Room, when they were holding me captive, they had me drink that red tea, and he was there. Cass, that stuff's dangerous. What else haven't you told me? When I saw The Witness in the hotel room... Yeah, when he looked like Aaron? And then he changed his appearance to you. To me, why? He was trying to get through to me. Talking about how they could stop death if they destroyed time. And he thought your face would have more of an impact on me. [sinister echoes] You hear that? [ominous music] [moaning] ♪ ♪ [moaning] Cass. [growling] Cassie? [dramatic music] [moaning] I'm sorry. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ This way. You can't get through that way. We can. I know the way. You sure? Dad... Lead the way. Stop. Shh. Go. Go. [suspenseful music] [dog panting] [barking and growling] Dad! [struggling] [dog snarling] Dad! Please, somebody help! Dad, get him off! Stop! Please! Dad! [grunts] Dad! [grunting] Please! [groaning] Get him off! [dog barks] Stop! Dad! [gunshots] [dog whimpering] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Sam, you okay? [ominous music] Sam! Sam! Sam! [footsteps approaching] [gasps] Ramse, you all right? Sam's gone. I lost him. Goddamn dog attacked me. Come on. I lost Cassie too. All kinds of sh1t roaming the hallways. Where'd they all come from? I don't know. The time-stream must have pulled them in. What are you talking about? The machine's melting down. We got to make it to the Core, kill the power. Oh, I got to go find Sam. Yeah, we're gonna find him. We don't kill the power, this whole place goes up. Him with it. Cassie. [static] Deacon, anybody, over. [static] All right, it's useless. All the temporal bullshit. It's cutting off the signal. Come on. [dramatic music] [static] Ahh... we got to hurry. We still have to haul ass back to the machine. Well then help me look. Uh-uh, I'm on watch. You are Jones's errand boy. Don't knock it. The job has good benefits. No details. Whoo-hoo. Beautiful. Oh. So that piece of sh1t is gonna stop this freak show? [sinister moaning] Let's go. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Stop right there! Hey, it's Deacon. Who's there? How'd you get in here? This is a restricted facility. Army personnel only. Army. What? Hey, friend, um, this sounds like a weird question. What year do you think it is? It's 1959, shithead. So, uh, fella, we've had a little bit of a time-travel snafu here, and... brace yourself... you're in the future... 2044 to be exact. So if you want to drop your weapon, we can catch up on the last... 85? 85 years. [gunshots] Take. Take it. Dies a pacifist or lives a man. Violence doesn't make a man. No, but it's a good way to unmake one. Point and pull and watch for the kick. Don't worry, I'll tell all your hippie friends that you fought them off with flowers and rainbows. Cover me, now! [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Come on. Okay. ♪ ♪ Oh! [moaning] Grenade! Jesus Christ. Ahh! [explosion] ♪ ♪ Oh. [struggling] Come on. [moaning] Nice throw, Gramps. Gramps? I'll kick your goddamn ass. [laughs] [suspenseful music] Oh, dear God. ♪ ♪ This place was an army base for 60 years. The machine must have splintered them from the past, but they don't seem fully present, so if we're lucky replacing the array and stopping the dispersment might return them to their time. I'm adjusting it to fit the energy conduits. Just a few minutes. It'll be ready. [groaning] It's getting worse out there. Just shut down the machine, and whatever stowaways are brought through, we take out one by one. It is not that simple, Mr. Deacon. The machine is in perpetual splinter sequence. Now that we have the array, we can stop the machine from dispersing more temporal energy. [sighs] If we can not shut down the Core, that machine is going to turn this entire place into a crater a mile wide. Crater I understand. Listen, Mr. Deacon, you have to see that they shut it down. There is no telling what they may have already encountered out there. [sighs] Okay. The rest of you get to the barracks. You too, Dr. Adler. I'm almost there. Please. [dramatic music] [electronic sputtering and whirring] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Sam! Dad! ♪ ♪ [sinister music] ♪ ♪ [beeping] Dad! ♪ ♪ [grandfather clock chiming] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Cassie! Open the door! Sam, you okay? Dad! She's trying to stop us from shutting down the Core. What the hell is wrong with her? I don't know. I don't know. Jones said something about another tether coming into the facility... another... another time-traveler. Where? I think we're looking at him. [sinister music] ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ [Ramse hitting the door] Dad. Sam? Dad! [sinister music] She's got a gun on my son. It's not her. Someone else is in control. It's that other tether. There's someone else in her head. Damn it. ♪ ♪ Sam? Sam, can you hear me? Everything's gonna be fine. I'm gonna get you out of there. You hear me? Cassie, listen to me. You need to open this door. That thing melts down, this whole place is gonna go up. Please. [dramatic music] What are you doing? Hey, he's trying to tell us something. What's he saying? ♪ ♪ He's looking at the floor. You're right. The river, good boy. Cole, there's a river beneath us. That's how we can get in. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [rumbling] [alarm blaring] No. What happened? The Hydronic chamber has blown open. What does that mean? There's no way anyone can replace the array. Not without being exposed to temporal radiation. [dramatic music] [grunts] ♪ ♪ [water running] sh1t. ♪ ♪ What do you see? Straight down, 50, 60 feet to the river. Still got to figure another way back up. Has to be me. That's my son. I got a better chance of getting through to her. You know that. You stay here with him where he can see you. Keep him calm. Trust me. [suspenseful music] All right. ♪ ♪ The Core is still active. Clearly whatever splintered here is stopping Cole from shutting it down. We have to replace the array regardless. There's no choice, Kat. [radio feedback] The radio. Is that them? James? [echoes] ♪ ♪ James, is that you? [echoes] [door slams shut] [alarm blares] David! David! David... [speaker beeps] David, what are you doing? [electricity cracking] Idiot. David, this will kill you! ♪ ♪ But it might save you. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Talk to me, Cole. Getting close. Jesus. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [wind howling] I'm gonna have to cross. Roger that. [footsteps approaching] Ramse, what the hell are you doing? Cole's down there. Cassie? [suspenseful music] [grandfather clock ticking] Where are you? Hang in there, buddy. We're coming. [clock chiming] Let me out! [screams] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] ♪ ♪ Get your hands up. Up now. Hold on. Easy. What'd you do to this place? What'd you do to us? We got a man down there, you understand me? Well, pull him up now! [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Ah! Whoa, whoa! What are you doing? [crackling] David! Get back here! Please. Oh, it's not so bad. I dig it actually. Going out in a wild, romantic gesture to a beautiful woman all in the name of love. ♪ ♪ I don't love you. You did once, and that can't be erased.

She's not gonna hurt you. Are you, Cass? [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Why don't you put that gun down? Whatever it is they did to you, that's what's causing this. If you can hear me in there, you need to fight. You need to let him go and let me shut down the Core. If you don't, everybody dies. Come on, Cass. I know you're in there. [clock ticking] You need to fight, Cassie. You're strong. You can beat this. [dramatic music] [clock ticking] Come on, Cassie. I know you're in there. What are you doing? Backup plan. You got to get in there and do what needs to be done. 'Cause Cole does not have it in him to stop her. And neither do I. ♪ ♪ [sinister muttering] Who are you?

[electric fizzling] Running out of time. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Cassie, look at me. Come on. Look at me, Cassie! Remember when you said we didn't really know each other anymore?

I know you. ♪ ♪ And I know... ♪ ♪ Ramse, shoot me. ♪ ♪ Shoot me! Come on, shoot me. Do it, now! [gunshot] [thuds] [gunshot] [dramatic music] Cole? Cole! [groaning] Hey, you okay?

With his ability to heal, he should be fine. [sighs] Katarina, what happened to me? [sighs] The tether we detected was not connected to another time-traveler physically but instead to a consciousness. It was a signal from somewhere in time. And your mind... Was the receiver. This is what The Witness did to you. He used you against us. He took control of you to sabotage the machine. [sinister music] ♪ ♪ I've prepared a series of injections that will purge whatever the 12 Monkeys left in your blood. He won't be able to do this to you again. How can you be sure?
