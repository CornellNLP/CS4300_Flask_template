 Previously on 12 Monkeys... 
 Murder the Witness? 
 Oh, that's before September 2044. 
 I saw a place called Titan. 
 We can go there together. 
 Then what? 
 We kill the Witness. 
 The search for Titan only leads to death. 
 We choose the wrong mission now, we don't get a second chance. 
 We're going back to '57. 
 Thank you both for being here. 
 What year is this? 
 I'm sorry, Cole. 
 What did you do to me? 
 Now we're out of time. The Red Forest is at our door. 
 We found Titan. 
 Lock them up. 
 But we can still do this. 
 There is no "we." Not anymore.

[fire crackling] Mother, please. We are running out... Out of time. ♪ ♪ Today's the day. One that ends at the beginning, and begins at the end. [fire crackling] Resurrection. [thunder crashes] We need to leave. What are we waiting for? James Cole? Mother, we will all die here. There are many endings. Today is one of them. [thunder crashes] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [thunder crashing and wind howling] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [thunder crashing and wind howling] ♪ ♪ How long do we got? Not long. Six hours, maybe seven. [thunderclap and lightning crackles] [rumbling] [thunder crashing] [muffled grunt] [door clangs open] [muffled thunderclaps] You ready? So how soon can I splinter back to '57? We need to hurry. We are working on it, but the massive paradox there makes programming your jump extraordinarily difficult. One wrong calculation and you could splinter inside a brick wall or to the middle of the ocean. Then our only hope stopping this storm... you... Would be gone forever. You're sure this will work, right? We stop the paradox, we fix time? It's more a hope than... certainty. You all right? [sighs] It's come down to this. If only the world had a better physicist to save it. I'm just here by default. You know I never would've done any of this if I didn't believe in you. I'd temper that faith until you see on whom we are depending. Dr. Lasky? ♪ ♪ Thomas. What? Uh, at least another six hours. I'm going as fast as I can. ♪ ♪ That's cutting it close. The storm will be right on top of us. There's no other option. I'm afraid the calculations are Dr. Adler's expertise. ♪ ♪ Cole : Can't trust Adler. Jones : That's why he remains under house arrest... along with Dr. Railly and Mr. Ramse. [muffled gunshot] The worst thing about betrayal is... [door clangs open] It never comes from one's enemies. ♪ ♪ I thought you were locked up too. We are... uh, were. Who is that? Hey. We've recruited others. We're not the only ones that have given up on Jones. She has no idea how to stop this. Neither does Cole. We're gonna do this our way. You're taking the facility. We found Titan. Tell her. Um, Titan appears to be in Colorado, across the continent. Far too dangerous for an overland trek. Suicide, really. So... I can splinter us there. Time travel, without the time. [snaps fingers] Instantly. Straight to the Witness. We find him. We kill him. How are we gonna stop the storms out there? After what he's done, he has to have another way to time travel, right? We use his way, his intel, to go back and stop it, undo everything he's ever done. But I have to start programming the jump. It'll take hours. What about Cole? What about him? We're not asking for permission. A coup. Ramse, you were at Spearhead. You know how dangerous... Hey. Look at me. Is the Witness in Titan? ♪ ♪ [clock ticking] Hey. Is he? Yes. You willing to bet your life on it? Yes. ♪ ♪ I want you to stay here. You get yourself ready. When the time comes... ♪ ♪ I don't want you to think twice. ♪ ♪ [door clangs open] ♪ ♪ Did you start the evacuation? Transports are loading up. What about Cassie and Ramse? I figured you'd want them out last, just in case they try anything. Yeah. That's what I thought. [thunder booms, light crackles] What the hell was that? [alarm blaring] [electricity crackling] What the hell happened? Lightning hit one of the transformers. And we can't slow down the evac. Have everyone take the west corridor to the Vehicle Bay. How many wounded? Two, one critical. She's gonna need a doctor. [muffled thunderclap] [machinery beeping] [muffled thunderclap] Need any help? I got it. Although I wonder if everything I'm doing is just prolonging the inevitable. You should come with me. To 1957? You don't even know who the Primary is back there. We'll find them. "There is no we." Remember? The fight is here, Cole. I'm not running away with you. Is that what you think I'm doing? Running away? I am trying... Don't try to save me. I'd rather take my chances in Titan. Will you bandage her up, please? What you're doing right now... Shutting down, locking everyone else out so you don't have to feel the pain... That's running away. [muffled thunderclap] Cole... we could go to Titan, find the Witness together. We'd never make it there alive. Even if the anomalies didn't kill us, there's scavs, militias... What if there were another way? ♪ ♪ [muffled thunderclap] [light bulb buzzing] [gunshots] [dramatic music] Donnelly, Lawson, go check it out. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Was that gunfire? [handcuffs clicking] What are you doing? This new way to Titan, does it involve the Machine? Secure the room. Don't take your eyes off her. Cole. Cole! [muffled thunderclap] [gunfire] Cole : Ramse, God damn it! What are you doing? Hold your fire! You all right? Yeah. I just got shot at. I'm great. We got to talk. [metallic clanging in distance] Don't shoot. [muffled thunder rumbling] Coming out. [dramatic stinger] So it's come to this, huh? [metallic clanging in distance] Doesn't have to. You can just walk away. Let us use the Machine. Not gonna happen. There's no time. There's plenty of time. Enough time to program one last jump. You don't know what you're walking into. Jennifer told me there's nothing but death at Titan. You won't find him. You'll kill yourself trying. I'm already dead. You can't know. You've never had a family. You've never been a father. [low rumbling in distance] I always thought you were my family. [tense music] I love you too. ♪ ♪ Both of us are not gonna end up on the same side of this. You know that, right? Can't let you take the Machine. You come for it, I ain't gonna stop them next time. ♪ ♪ [gun clicks] You really want it to end like this? Don't do it, Cole. You might get me, but then they'll get you. Then neither of us gets a chance. Yeah, sometimes you got to lose to win. [muffled thunderclap] ♪ ♪ Well, one of us is gonna win. ♪ ♪ Good luck. ♪ ♪ [muffled thunderclap] Jones, we got trouble. Ramse's with Adler and Harris. They're coming for the Machine. Door secure. How did they escape? Marcus shut the blast doors. We are secure. But when the calculations are finished, you must splinter immediately. We're running out of time. I'll be there. Just need to even the odds a bit first. Deacon: ♪ Don't you forget about me ♪ ♪ I'll be alone dancing you know it baby ♪ 
♪ Tell me your troubles and doubts ♪ Deacon. [muffled thunderclap] What the hell are you doing? [knife clangs] Consider this a little end-of-the-line party. [muffled thunderclap] Go out the way I came in. What do you say? [cork pops] You want to sword fight? Relax. You couldn't take me. Jesus Christ. Put your goddamn clothes on. I need your help. Oh, you need my help? Everybody needs my help until they don't. My boys, Cassie. [electricity crackles] Doesn't matter now. My God. Of all the things, I never thought it would be Cassie who would take you down. Oh... contrary to popular belief and my sociopathic tendencies, a heart beats in this chest. Jesus, man. [thunderclap and deep rumbling] [scoffs] You know, I knew my days with her were numbered when you came back. Never been like that. But Ramse? Who would've thought he'd put a flag in her? Ugh, it's not like that either. I got an idea. Why don't we... Why don't we have a drink and talk about killing Ramse? Just like the old days. ♪ Don't you forget about me ♪ All right, pity party's over. It is over when I say it's over. The world is gonna end before you finish that bottle. Ahh! Works for me. [thunderclap] All the sh1t that you have lived through... The virus, scavs, the Foreman, your father... You really want to go out like this? Jesus. You even talk like him. Like who? My baby brother. ♪ ♪ You are a survivor. That is what you do. Now, we are out of time here. I need your help so we can survive. Will you help me? ♪ ♪ All right, Cole. [glass shatters] Let's go save the worl... [vomiting] That's right. Get it all up. [thunderclap] Agh! Good? 100%. The Machine Room is secure. You need to get to the Core. If I know Ramse, he's gonna try to take it and... [explosion booms] [elecricity powering down] [lights thudding] sh1t. [metallic creaking] [bangs on door] sh1t. [muffled thunderclap] [metallic creaking] Hold on a minute... we can't just walk straight in there. Shh! [knocks rhythmically on door] [door creaks] Whitley? What took you so long? [tense music] No. ♪ ♪ Marcus. Sorry, Jones. I know you tried to fix all this, but we can't chase our tails forever. We have to stop playing defense. Adler, you don't have a lot of time to program the Machine. Nor the power if you have disabled the Core. Just a temporary suspension. [power whirs on] Who did this to you? Cole? Where is he? [muffled thunderclap] Ramse, where is he? You think I'd kill him in cold blood? I don't know anymore. Hey, Lasky, you know what's good for you, get away from those controls now. Jones : No. You're gonna get a lot of people hurt, lady. You fool. We are all dead if Cole doesn't go to 1957. All your theories... You don't... All your missions... Bullshit. Adler, get to it! Julian, you are a scientist. You know we have a chance. What'd I say? The paradox in '57... Mr. Cole can stop it. We haven't been able to stop a goddamn thing, Katarina. Not the plague, not the Messengers, and not this bloody storm. You've had your chance. Now it's our turn. This last splinter is for us. We are going to Titan. The hell you are. Drop it, Cole. Put it down. Nobody here wants to hurt you. But you will if you have to, right? Long as you get your revenge. Look around you, Cole. You're outnumbered. ♪ ♪ You're right. I can't stop all of you. Thing is, I don't have to. ♪ ♪ [gunshot] [screams] [both grunting] Harris! Come on! Move! Cassie! [both grunt] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Kill me. Kill the Witness. It won't matter. You'll still be afraid... of yourself. Because you're the one who let him in. ♪ ♪ [muffled thunderclap] ♪ ♪ [doors whir shut] ♪ ♪ The bullet went through, missed the artery. This should slow down the bleeding. Hey, Cass. You all right? I don't like it any more than you do, but it's what we have to do. Adler? I just need time to calculate the trajectory and program the coordinates. Marcus, after all you gave up for our mission, your father... It was your mission. Always has been. Now it's ours. Hey, that's enough from you. Let go of me. ♪ ♪ You're not in charge anymore, lady. This is the second time you've pointed a gun at me, Mr. Ramse. I assure you there won't be a third. [both grunt] Ramse. [radio static crackles] Harris: Whitley, it's Harris. Over. [muffled thunderclap] Go ahead. [winds howling] One of our Humvees just took off from the Vehicle Bay. Where's it heading? Looks like north. Over. Copy that. Sit tight and keep me updated. It's Cole. Running? The Daughters. Their camp is north. I want you to take your guys, you seal up all the access points... Gates, tunnels, vents, everything. You be careful. Everything is already sealed. Except everything Cole just unsealed before he left. Cole's not crazy enough... It's not Cole's brand of crazy I'm worried about. Get your ass up there. ♪ ♪ Anything happens to Jones, you'll find out just how fast I change my mind about backing your plan. ♪ ♪ Doc? You better hurry up. ♪ ♪ Let's go.

Mother won't leave. There's something wrong with her. She's been saying a lot of strange things lately. Sounds like regular Jennifer to me. No, she won't listen to us. You have to convince her to go. [thunderclap] Jennifer. I need your help. Mayday, mayday! Terrorists have taken over the Nakatomi Building, Century City! I don't know what that means. It means, McClane, that I know why you're here. They've got your Machine, and you want me and my Daughters to be the cavalry. Will you help? Have I ever said no to you? Self preservation was never my thing. ♪ ♪ But there's something you've got now. I've seen it in all the adventures we've shared, even the ones we haven't yet. You're changing. Into what? A leader. Takes one to know one. And the one thing I've learned is that a leader needs to make sacrifices. It's the price of taking people on. Are you willing to let someone you love die for your mission? For the good of the world? [somber music] Say it. I am. And when you do, never look back. [ominous music] [thunder rumbles] Okay, campers! Get your horses, blades, and boom-sticks ready! We're moving out! Where are we going? Into the storm. [gun clicks] All right, ladies! You heard her! Saddle up! We're moving out! ♪ ♪ [thunderclap] [thunder rumbling] [door creaks] [thunder rumbles] Adler better hurry. It's bad out here. As soon as we splinter out for Titan,  you need to evacuate the scientists and the rest of your men. Copy that. Any sign of Cole? Negative... if he has any sense, he's gone for good. Cole's not finished yet. Trust me. We've got eyes on the north. He's not coming back. Oh, no, no, no, look to the south. [wind howls and electricity crackles] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ sh1t. That's what I thought. It's Cole. He alone? No, he's got the Daughters with him. They're heading down to the south loading dock. How much longer? Minutes. Whit, listen to me. All we have to do is keep them out of the Machine Room  for another... Ten. Ten minutes, and then we're set. You get back down here and guard the corridor. See you in five. Harris, let's get down to the basement. [gunshot] Come on down. [wind howls and thunder crashes] On your knees. ♪ ♪ Make a wish.
