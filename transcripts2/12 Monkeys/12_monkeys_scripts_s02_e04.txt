 Previously, on "12 Monkeys"... 
 1944, that's what the Messengers wanted. 
 Monkeys are coming for me. 
 The Messengers, they need me dead. 
 Primary. 
 Why? 
 Both : We are time. 
 My herb, they don't work unless the leaves are red. 
 Gives you pictures in your head you can't erase. No! They're gonna kill him there. Not before he tells us everything he knows. Looks like Crawford was murdered in his office. His killers, a man and a woman, were never found. We shall meet again in the Red Forest. We have to go back, we were there. The structure of space-time is collapsing. Data showed these anomalies multiplying in the time stream. Paradox? We've lost their connection. Those temporal anomalies. This is their origin. Move! Mr. Ramse. Katarina Jones. You spared Mr. Deacon's life yesterday. Yeah, I did. How long's it gonna be before he tries to execute me again? Mr. Ramse, we need your help. Well, why didn't you say so? What do you need me to do? You need me to beg for mercy while you break my fingers? That's not what... How about electrocution? You could tie a wire around my one nut! Mr. Cole is in jeopardy, and so is Dr. Railly. What are you talking about? What did you do now? They're both stuck in the past. Their tethers are broken, and we have no way of bringing them back. We need you to go back to 1944, find them, and bring them home safely. You trust me now? I trust your relationship with Mr. Cole enough to know that you will help him. And you are the only traveler we have now. [scoffs] It will be dangerous. This is a much different time, and we're all at war. I know the 12 Monkeys are there as well and no doubt have something to do with the massive temporal disturbance. Paradox. See, I can send you back before that event. Mr. Ramse, you can find them, you can save their lives, and you can bring them back home. And when you do... When I do? I will guarantee your freedom. You'll be free to walk out of here with your son. New formula. Hurts a bit more. Sorry, but it won't kill you. Let's say I find them. How do all three of us get back here? Jones is working on that. You're only sending him back two days before the paradox. Is that enough time? I don't want to give him the opportunity to simmer back there. No telling what he could do. Why are you sending him back if you don't trust him? Because at the moment I'm lacking of a great many things, and options are among them. So, let me get this straight, you want me to place a classified ad in the paper? Do it every day, and we'll find it. Assuming, of course, that some aspect of causality still works. That's gonna help you snatch us back home, right? Yeah. That's not convincing. It is a theory at the moment, but it's a good theory. Still not convincing. You're afraid about what I saw out there. What tore that guy apart. You have any answers as to why that's happening? All right. I can only fix one of your mistakes at a time. Let's get on with it. 1944, here I come. The target is the Mission Cross Mental Asylum. We'll put you as close as we can to the 600 block of Oak Ridge Terrace, Jersey City. That's where we lost the tether. It's up to you, Mr. Ramse. Initiate Spencer sequence. [groans] [car horn honking] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [thunder rumbling] You can take off the masks. No virus did this. Then what did? Time, Mr. Whitley. Some catastrophic event in 1944 disrupted the fabric of space-time, causing temporal anomalies in the here and now. Anomalies? Pockets of unstable time. Deadly. Expanding. If we don't find a solution, at this term of acceleration, this will consume the world in a matter of months. We'll all end up like these men, ravaged by time. They left the facility this morning, and here they are, aged hundreds of years. Why here? Why now, at this time? Is this what broke Cole and Dr. Railly's tether in 1944? I don't know. Einstein, Hawking, Godel, in all their theories about time and causality, they never spoke of anything like this. We are in uncharted territory. Take a look. The Daughters. Maybe they know what's happening. [thunder rumbles] Possibly. But I believe the answer lies with Mr. Cole and Dr. Railly in 1944. [gentle jazz music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ I should not be ♪ 
♪ Seeing you ♪ Miss, The Emerson has a strict dress code. It's all right. [groaning] Morning, sunshine. You're finally awake. What's your name? José. José Ramse. Well, Mr. Ramse, you're one lucky man. Not many people get hit by a car and live to tell the tale. You have osteoporosis in your arm, which is kind of strange for someone so young. And you heal fast. Like, unusually fast. What's today's date? It's Friday, September 1st. Hold on, buster, where do you think you're going? It's happening tomorrow. You have had a serious accident. The doctor's scheduled surgery to set that bone. No surgery. You have to stay in bed. You'll have plenty of time to recover. After surgery, okay? A few days, at least. I need to speak to James Cole. He's a guest there. Mr. Cole? Yes? Telephone. For me? He asked for James Cole. Hello? Nothing. Mr. Ramse, you cannot use this phone. It's for nurses only. My apologies, sir. There was a man on the line. It sounded urgent. All right, thanks, Dan. Frankie? Wait. Okay, bedtime. Wait, wait, no. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. You need to rest up for your surgery, Mr. Ramse. [exhales] Where you going? To get ready. We have work to finish. Cole. This is madness. It's growing closer. We're still at a loss. A lifetime of study, and I'm reduced to fumbling around in the dark. Well, you're still being watched. Where you going? I need to see her. Fraulein Jones. Miss Goines, I've noticed you have taken an interest in what's happening out there. Kat, strange things are afoot at the Circle K. No... Sit. I prefer to stand. I'm not sure why I'm here other than the fact that Mr. Cole... Otter Eyes. Mr. Cole believes that you are special somehow, connected to time. And, well, these days I'm not. Do you know what caused these anomalies out there? Caused? That's your problem. Cause or effect, chicken, egg, beginning, ends. Not so simple. No straight lines. Do you have more to offer than riddles? The Monkeys made it, but the who is not important. It's the how, it's the why. I know how. They used my machine. Says the ant. Excuse me? A colony of ants all in a line. Hundreds, thousands. But one ant only knows of three. The one in front, the one behind, and itself. Until... It steps out of line, then it sees everything. You're looking wrong. Looking at what wrong? Time. You don't know how it works. [scoffs] But I can show you. What's that? This is an answer from the Red Forest. These leaves have been altered by disruption of space and time. I have no doubt they bring you visions, Miss Goines, but they'll also bring you death. Hmm, have a little faith. Mr. Cole and Dr. Railly are lost in time. This anomaly is threatening to kill us all. I don't have the time to break on through to the other side with you. Jim Morrison, primary. Good day. [swing music] Uncle Sam rationing razor blades now? I'm going some place cold. Like the North Pole? Who we fighting there, Shirley? I found one of the Messengers. She's with Crawford. [grunts] sh1t. We're too late. Well, the doctor's on his way for your procedure. The Messengers made a mistake. They killed the wrong Crawford. Tommy and his father have the same name. When they figure this out, they're gonna go after him. Where is he now? Mission Cross Mental Asylum. Cole? [footsteps approaching] The Traveler. You shouldn't be here. Your cycle is complete. You know, the cycle's changed. Right? I'm looking for James Cole. Where is he? Hmm? You know, things haven't gone according to plan. The plan does not alter. When you left the facility in 2043, we had some problems. Some of the others got killed. Cole and Dr. Railly, they pursued you here. I could stop them. I infiltrated the enemy. Help me. Help me stop them. So that you can save your son? Yes. I have known of your cycle my whole life. Your love for your son is long and storied by The Witness. A child is something I cannot have. My cycle ends here. You have to let me go. The Witness asked me personally. Lies. The Witness does not ask. The Traveler? I found them. They're on the second floor. sh1t! 
 
 [thunder rumbles, lightning cracks] Dr. Adler, the newspaper from 1944. Hmm? Have you checked it? There was nothing this morning. Nothing has changed. Uh, I can check again, but, uh, you're assuming causality... Dr. Adler, this is the most important information we could possibly receive. So what more reason do you need to check? Huh? And keep checking it until you find it! Am I the only one who's realizing what's happening here? Move. The very fabric of our existence is unraveling. [grunts, gunshot fires] Our best hope and our worst hope  is lost in the past, and I have no idea what to do. No! We know nothing! [gunshot, gasping] You see? Nothing! What on God's green Earth happened here? [indistinct chatter] Keep the hallway clear. [indistinct chatter] Clear. Put them in our car. I need to talk to them. Knock him out, he's not gonna tell you anything. He goes out, that wakes him up. Something's wrong. We should've splintered by now. See, right there. You "should've splintered." What does that mean? [spits] Okay, look. The reason we brought you here is we're in a huge sh1t storm because of you two. So before things get all complicated with lawyers and judges, we gotta get this right. [sighs] Let's have it, honey. I'm honey. She's babycakes. [chuckling] You got tangled up with the wrong guy. It happens, but he's put you in a situation here. A real bad situation. We were trying to save those people. We failed. I, uh, made you for Krauts when you killed the professor. He's heavy with the War Department, all top secret, but then you went and killed his son, blowing up his loony bin in the process. We got your, uh, picture at the party. Lab boys worked overtime on that, and we found you at the center of that blast. Truth is, locking you up would be easy. But I don't think this is about the war. Truth is, the first time I saw this guy, I knew there was something out of place. [knocking on door] NYPD, open up! Hey, brother. Ramse. How are you here? Get me out of these. Jones sent me. Something wrong with the tether. Thought you guys were in trouble. The paradox. Let's go home, guys. Not yet. What are you talking about? I need to find the woman who killed Crawford's son. Cole, it's over. We gotta get back to 2044. 2044? Your country thanks you for your service, Shirley. So what's Jones' plan for getting us back without a tether? I have to place a classified ad in the paper, give her an exact time, specific location. She then reads it in 2044. She thinks that she could lock onto us that way. From a 100-year-old newspaper? It's her plan, not mine, brother. What's in this for you? Just the pure pleasure of saving your life. Oh. So now you're saving people? All right. We're not leaving. Not till we figure out what the 12 Monkeys are doing here. We have nothing to go on. That woman was either killed in the paradox or is long gone. We will never find her. You want to give up? [sighs] Your little friend, she's got a severe attitude problem. But she's right this time. It's time to go. There's some weird sh1t happening in 2044. Where the hell are you going? Do you want to get home? I gotta place an ad. Then I'm going with you. I was just starting to like it here. [thunder rumbling] Why are you being such an asshole? How dare you? I'm trying to solve the problem. No, you're not. You're trying to be right, so let's try this instead. Just... just shut up and listen. Open your mind. You are not just a scientist. You are an explorer. You're pushing boundaries. Inventing the new. You're not just analyzing the old. That's what makes you you, Katarina. Oh, time is cruel. Because of that, you don't know me. But, boy, I know you, and you are lost, and you're scared. But what does the explorer do when they're lost? They go full speed ahead into the unknown. [chuckles] You taught me that. Now what are you doing? Ad's already been sent. Jones should be able to find us. Pickup's not till tomorrow morning. I'm gonna have myself a fresh, cold, 1944 beer. Beer and whiskey, please? If you want to partake. You can hate me. That's fine. What about Cole? I, uh... I'm alive because of him. You know what, Cassie? I could say one thing with absolute certainty. And what's that, Ramse? James Cole is loyal. To a fault. That's a rare thing. He beats himself up for what he turned you into, and you want to hate him for it. I don't hate him. Forgive him. Like he did me. Like he would for you. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Wait, wait! I don't think you killed the Crawfords. And you had a chance to take me out before, you didn't. What do you want? Cole, right? James Cole, that's your name? Right there. My guy had evidence, he did some digging. That necklace you gave Ms. Thompson? That design doesn't even come out until early next year. And your friend from the motel, Ramse? Doctors here have a lot of questions about his medical conditions. Like why, uh, parts of his body seem to have aged unevenly. Yeah, there's that. And there's that bizarre explosion at the asylum. Where the hell are you from, Cole? Well, I could answer that. Say it out loud, you'll think I'm crazy, or that you're crazy. But we don't have time for that. I think you're a guy who wants to do the right thing. There was a woman brought in here today. She wants to destroy the world. One day, the people she works for will do that. If I don't find out why, I can't stop them. Let me talk to her. [chuckles] Right now, I don't know if you're telling the truth, or I've just read one too many H.G. Wells stories. Well, what's your gut tell you? James Cole. What I was sent to do is done. They never imagined I'd survive the paradox, but The Father, he made us too well. I spent my whole life preparing to die in 1944. I never thought I'd want to stay, to have a life and a child. Why did you kill the Crawfords? You won't understand. But he will. Crawford was primary. Why paradox him? What are you trying to do? Stop time's cruel destruction. Unlock the infinite. You'll try and stop it, but you can't. I cannot kill James Cole. The Witness has spoken. The world is ending out there. I need an answer. Something. A guess at least. [mystical music] ♪ ♪ [soft whispers] Stay with me. Where are we? Not where, when. Listen. [animalistic utterances] This is the day we woke up. And that smart little monkey wasn't just a monkey anymore. It was human. That's not how it works. It didn't happen just in one day. We evolved because we were given time. Then what happens to time, given time? Evolution. Time and man, we grew up together. We depend on each other. Impossible. Time is older than man, and infinite. But in the here and now, we help it think. Time needs us. Some of us more than others. Primaries. Primaries... living, breathing gears in time's wristwatch. We keep it moving, steady, in sync. Tick, tock, past, present, future. But now, if someone were to destroy us... Paradox. Gears break. Time stops working. Collapses. No past. No present. No future. Only now. An infinite now of death and life together. No beginning. No end. All of humanity unborn and destroyed. A memory of tomorrow. I'm not sure there's anything I can say to convince my bosses you two didn't kill all those people. That's all right. I'll take the rap for it. Be careful. The Bureau has a long memory. No FBI where we're from. Yeah, so, look, I want to help. Maybe, one day. Almost time. You're gonna want to see this. Katarina, Katarina! It worked, he did it. Mr. Ramse placed the ad and gave us the encrypted coordinates. Lock into these. Let's bring them home. Yeah, you won't forget it. H.G. Wells. [chuckles] Holy sh1t. [triumphant music] ♪ ♪ Jones. We know what the 12 Monkeys are doing. They're trying to destroy time. Didn't just kill Crawford son, they brought part of him back with them. A knife made from his bones to create a massive paradox. They're using time against itself. They're destroying these primaries like critical points on a structure, bringing it to a collapse. This doesn't exactly sound like Stephen Hawking. Because there is nothing in the world of scientific theory to support this. However, the natural world is full of firsts. That's what Jennifer wanted to show me. So what now? There is no way of knowing how many primaries must be destroyed to collapse time. But if they succeed, all of history, all of humanity, will collapse into itself. The Red Forest, a temporal hell on Earth. What are we gonna do now? I'm pretty sure your part in this is over. I don't think you have any say in that, darling. Doc? Mr. Ramse helped us today. Thank you. Don't... thank me. Don't thank you? You know what? You can go live in hell for all I care. Your mission caused all of this. Your mistakes. And you were one of them. I can't believe you trusted him in 1944. You shut up... The damage that he could... I was desperate to save your life, Dr. Railly. I didn't want to go back in the first place. To chase the only lead we had? Awfully small-minded of you. You have a problem with me? Yes, Ramse. I have a problem with you. If it wasn't for him... Are you seriously asking me... You'd be dead. What my problem... If it wasn't for him, you wouldn't be here. Enough, enough. You wouldn't be alive! [all arguing] Enough, enough! Look outside, they already won. We need to come together. The Messengers are destroying time. We need to figure out a way to track them down. But there's no way to tell where or when... We find a way. Just like we always do. Piece by piece. Now, look, not all of us chose to be here. But we're here now. We need to bury the past. It's the only way to save the future. Thanks. [labored breathing] It is time, my son. My journey ends, but yours begins. The Army of the 12 Monkeys will show you your path. Have faith that The Witness has spoken, and that one day you, my son, will set things right. [sinister music] ♪ ♪ Tick tock, witness blood on snow, 1944, the doctor heals... The voices will stop... Stop... Witness blood... Hi, um, I'm ready. I'm ready for them to stop now. The voices. For real this time. Please, I need them to stop, okay? Please. Okay, what's your name? Jennifer. Jennifer Goines. Okay, Jennifer. Wait right there. [chaotic whispering resumes] [whistling]
