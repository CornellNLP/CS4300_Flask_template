 Previously on 12 Monkeys... 
 Four years from now, most of the human race is gonna be wiped out by a plague. 
 Many became scavengers, raiding whatever they could get their hands on. 
 Leland Goines had a secret lab. His daughter knows where it is. 
 They want what's inside. 
 Tell me the location of the Night Room. 
 Their specialized equipment... you find it, you find the Night Room. 
 If he finds out about the facility, the West 7 will pick us clean. 
 It's gonna be a problem. 
 I found shelter, and you won't believe what else. 
 I found Cole. 
 So what am I looking at here? 
 Possible sites of the Night Room, arranged in varying degrees of probability. 
 I had to cross-reference suppliers with shipping data, decipher a lot of technical jargon. 
 You got all this from the CDC? 
 Yeah. 
 And some cold calls. 
 My bullshitting skills are getting a workout. 
 There's still too many possible sites. 
 And the 12 Monkeys already have Jennifer Goines. 
 Well, they're going to have to break through a lot of crazy before she leads them anywhere. 
 And if they find it first? 
 We stop them. 
 Kill them? 
 If that's what it takes, yeah. 
 Look, Cassie, these guys... 
 Are worth 7 billion. 
 I know how it works now. 
 The math is easy. 
 Never said it was easy. 
 Look, if you knew what it was like back there, what I've seen, you'd understand. 
 Then tell me. 
 You know all about me... 
 Where I'm from. 
 You know where I'm going to die. 
 I don't know anything about you. 
 What is there to know? 
 Well... well, let's start with where you're from. 
 Look, if we stay focused on the mission, none of that's gonna matter. 
 Look, there's nothing to tell. 
 I don't know what it is about you that you don't want me to know. 
 Cass. 
 It's got to be here somewhere. 
 If this is a bust, we head out at first light. 
 Might be too hungry to move anywhere, man. 
 We're down to scraps. 
 [Distant clatter] 
 [Dog whimpering] 
 Ramse. 
 Take the shot. 
 I'm taking it. I'm taking it, man. 
 Relax. 
 [Dog whimpering] 
 Come on, take the shot. 
 Hey, why don't you take the shot? 
 You saw it, you kill it. That's the rules. 
 Since when has that been a rule, man? 
 That was never a rule. 
 [Dog whimpering] 
 I'm starving. 
 [Dog whimpering] 
 We're gonna die. You know that? 
 We'll find something. 
 Always do. 
 No. 
 We're in atari. 
 Atari? What's that? 
 It's a game called Go. 
 Game I used to play when I was a little kid. 
 It means you're out of moves. 
 Got one move left, whether you like it or not. 
 So atari's bad? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Stay out of atari, brother. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Distant clatter] 
 [Dog growling] 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Grunting] 
 What's going on? Why am I back here? 
 We brought you back before your scheduled return. 
 This shot will help with the pain. 
 Careful. Here... let me orient you. 
 I am Thomas Lasky. Your name is Cole. 
 It is 2043, the afternoon on a Wednesday. 
 All right. All right, it's Wednesday. 
 I got it. [Coughing] 
 What's going on? 
 We got a problem. 
 Took down two scavs on the perimeter this morning. 
 They're marked... like this. 
 West 7. 
 That didn't take long. 
 Max lied. 
 She's still with them. 
 If Deacon's on to this place, it's a mother lode. 
 Welcome back, Mr. Cole. 
 We're tracking the Night Room. 
 Cassie's getting close. 
 You should still be there. 
 Yes, but Mr. Ramse believes we are under imminent threat of attack. 
 By scavengers. 
 We don't know how many are out there. 
 They're going to hit us hard, though. 
 It's irrelevant. 
 With our defenses, we can take a few dozen scavs. 
 Yeah. 
 They're West 7. 
 This is our old crew, okay? 
 Now, Deacon, the guy that runs them... 
 Got it. The Scav King. 
 Very scary. 
 He's got twice our number. 
 Don't underestimate him. 
 Take Mr. Cole and Mr. Ramse with you up top. 
 I don't need them. 
 They have experience with these people. You don't. 
 If this facility were to fall, all would be lost. 
 The mission's everything. 
 How's Cassie? 
 Right before I splintered, she was asking me all kinds of questions... where I was born, what my life's like back here, that kind of thing. 
 What did you tell her? 
 What is there to tell? 
 Come on. 
 Are you gonna tell her about your best friend? 
 Guy who devours blondes for dinner? 
 Elena wasn't blonde. 
 Elena was a whole different thing, man. 
 I know. 
 I think you'd like Cassie, though. 
 She reminds me of you... always waving her moral compass around. 
 She waving yours? 
 [Chuckles] No. Thanks for asking. 
 [Over radio] Copy that. 
 Perimeter guards spotted a vehicle headed this way... couple of miles out, said it was packing some armor. 
 Sounds like them. 
 Secure the doors. 
 Got your boogie shoes on? 
 Size 11s. 
 Let's bring back some memories. 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Gunshot] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Ramse. Put it down. 
 Put it down. Put it down, come on. 
 I would listen to your friend, son. 
 These are two of my meanest. 
 Do you know who we are? 
 West 7. 
 You slaughtered everybody at the Western 7 Quarantine Zone... doctors, soldiers. You killed kids. 
 Quarantine? 
 [All chuckling] 
 Please. 
 Do you want to live the rest of your life behind plastic? 
 Hell, those survivors never stood a chance, son. 
 Their DNA sealed their fate years ago. 
 The world belongs to the immune, to us. 
 200 strong, and not one starving. 
 You look tired... tired of running, tired of looking over your shoulder. 
 Am I right? 
 Hmm? 
 And it appears we have a couple of openings. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're real survivors. 
 You made it this far. That is good. 
 Don't you want a warm place to sleep tonight... full bellies? 
 It sure as hell beats the alternative. 
 I don't think so. 
 We're listening. 
 We're listening. 
 My name's Cole. 
 This is Ramse. 
 I am Deacon. 
 [Man shouting] 
 Light 'em up. 
 Twelve o'clock. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Got more over here! 
 To the right! 
 [Man shouts] 
 Target hit! 
 Get down! 
 [Grunting] 
 Cole! Cover me! 
 Hey. 
 Ugh! 
 Whitley? 
 We're clear down here. What do you got? 
 Nothing up top. That wasn't much of an assault. 
 This ain't it, man. 
 It was a diversion. 
 Yeah, Deacon's putting on a show. 
 They found another way in. 
 Whitley? You got men stationed at the exhaust tunnels? 
 I put a two-man team on it, but no way then can know about those tunnels. 
 Don't be so sure. 
 Cole! 
 They're inside! Scavs are coming through the tunnels! 
 I'm headed down. 
 Spread out. 
 Find the choke points, the usual. 
 We are moving in. 
 And I don't feel like sharing. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Food, water, booze, women... hell of a lot better than you're used to. 
 This is you. 
 Why the tents? 
 We are expanding, growing in numbers, gathering supplies. 
 Raiding survivors. 
 Oh, did you boys find a way to survive without doing the same? 
 We've been on our own for a long time. 
 He'll be okay. 
 Max. 
 Max, this is Cole. 
 I have high hopes for Cole. 
 Cole could use a new friend, couldn't you, Cole? 
 So be his friend and show him around. 
 She doesn't have to. It's okay. 
 Why? You got something better to do? 
 I'll go slow. 
 You just try and keep up. 
 Welcome home, Cole. 
 How'd they find out about the tunnels? 
 No idea. 
 [Gunfire] 
 [Man shouting] 
 [Gunshots] 
 Got two on your right! 
 Easy. 
 It's us. 
 Blue Team, to the right tunnel! 
 How many inside? 
 No idea. 
 They knew about the exhaust tunnels. 
 Any of your guys go missing? 
 No. 
 We have to secure the machine. 
 Nothing else matters now. 
 Not just the machine. 
 They see these lights. 
 They know we got a hell of a power source. 
 Ramse stays with me. We'll secure the core. 
 You take Jones to the machine. 
 We'll seal it off. Keep them out. 
 Eyes open. 
 Always. 
 Come on. 
 Cole? 
 Go! 
 [Man shouts indistinctly] 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 Open this door. 
 Ramse, you at the core yet? 
 I'm here. 
 We're sealed inside the splinter chamber. 
 Deacon's right outside the door. 
 Sorry, buddy. 
 You're on your own from here on out. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm in atari. 
 What? 
 [Gunfire] 
 Ramse? 
 Ramse? 
 Get out of my way. 
 Is that really what you want? 
 Move! 
 You'll never make it! 
 You'll kill one, maybe two, and you'll be dead. 
 And Ramse will have died for nothing. 
 [Beeping] 
 I can send you back. 
 We still have power. 
 Back to Dr. Railly for good. 
 You will not have my support, but you'll have hers. 
 Come on. 
 [Explosion] 
 You're out of time. 
 Come on! 
 I'm sending you as close as I can to when you left Dr. Railly. 
 Most likely we'll never see each other again. 
 [Explosion] 
 Good-bye, Mr. Cole. 
 It's James. 
 Katarina. 
 [Machine powering up] 
 [Gunfire] 
 Run, you bastards! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 We're right behind you! 
 I'm sick of this, man. 
 I'm sick of hearing you whine about it. 
 We got a job to do. 
 Robbing sad sacks for dog food? 
 We're part of a tribe now, brother. 
 That's what this is? It's a tribe? 
 Best we ever had it. 
 You're serious? 
 Are you ladies ready? 
 Let's do this. 
 Hey. 
 Go. Go! 
 [Gun clicks] 
 Stop! 
 It's over. 
 We already took their sh1t. 
 Let's move on. 
 Careful, Ramse. 
 We got everything we need. 
 Let them live, create an enemy. 
 They're weak. 
 They got nothing. 
 We're not creating anything. 
 Yes... we are. 
 And it's ours, not theirs. 
 Shame about the meek. 
 They don't inherit sh1t. 
 Cole! 
 Aah! 
 [Winces] Ah! 
 I said stay still. 
 I'm trying to. 
 Yeah? Try harder. 
 Ah! 
 What a baby. [Chuckles] 
 Ah, what would you do without me, huh? 
 I don't... I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. I don't think it cut too deep. 
 I'm not talking about that. 
 You know, I've been with the 7 for a long time... since I was 13. 
 A lot of days like today, and, um... that sort of thing, it can get to you... after a while. 
 13, huh? 
 Mm. 
 Isn't that when your dad... 
 Yeah. 
 When he was killed. 
 By scavs. 
 Why'd you join up? 
 You never told me. 
 Because I had no choice. 
 Ah! 
 There. 
 You're all done. 
 So what if you did have a choice, then, huh? 
 Mm. 
 Where would you be? 
 That depends. 
 Where are you? 
 Jeez. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. 
 See you later. 
 See you later. 
 
 
 
 Couldn't wait? 
 Do you know why I'm here? 
 Look, uh... Ramse's got his own way of looking at things. 
 I'm sure he wasn't trying to challenge your authority or... 
 [Glasses clink] 
 Do you like it here? 
 What do you want me to do? 
 See, that's what I like about you, Cole. 
 I don't have to sugarcoat things. 
 You are welcome here. 
 But Ramse has to go. 
 You let him live, create an enemy. 
 Now, I could do it. 
 But it would be worse. 
 I would have to... 
 I'd have to make an example out of him... take my time. 
 I understand. 
 Men like us... understand what the world is now... what it takes... to survive. 
 And there ain't a lot of us left. 
 But at least you're not alone anymore. 
 By sunup. 
 [Coughing] 
 Ah. 
 Oh, no. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Hey. 
 I thought that was you. 
 What did you do? 
 You killed him! 
 [Grunting] 
 What are you talking about? 
 What about Jones, the woman? You kill her too? 
 Cole, you're not making any sense. 
 You led them right to us. 
 Ramse trusted you. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Salutations, my friend Cole. 
 Look at you. 
 Years haven't changed you a bit. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Wait... wait a minute, wait a minute. 
 What... what day is it? 
 Is it Wednesday? 
 Damn. How hard did you hit him? 
 It's Monday. 
 It's good to know the day. 
 It's the first day of the rest of your life. 
 Don't worry. 
 It won't be long. 
 I don't know how much more sh1t I can take from that guy. 
 Trust me. 
 He feels the same. 
 You talked to him already? 
 Yeah, I talked to him. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Here... take it. 
 Hey. 
 Okay. 
 I mean, it's what you came here to do, but I don't... I don't even know why we're wasting time. 
 I don't even know who you are, man. 
 I'm a survivor, and I'm doing it a hell of a lot better than you or I ever did on our own. 
 Okay, you don't get it, man. 
 Deacon understands what the world is. 
 Deacon? Deacon's a cult. 
 His followers... his followers are murderers. 
 You got a short memory, man. 
 You and I did plenty before the 7. 
 When we had to. 
 It's the same thing. 
 When we had to! 
 Deacon's taking... for power. 
 Okay? He's murdering... 
 'cause he likes it. 
 Whatever this world is now... it shouldn't be this, man. 
 It shouldn't be this. 
 What are you waiting for? 
 [Shivers] 
 Man, I got to get out of here tonight. 
 We go together, man. 
 Deacon's gonna try to hunt us down. 
 We should take care of him first. 
 You want to take on the whole crew? 
 That's suicide, man. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Gasps, spits] 
 [Grunts] 
 How you doing? 
 It's Tuesday, by the way. 
 I know you're having trouble keeping track. 
 This girl has some unresolved issues where you're concerned. 
 You... you have been living the good life... clean water, lights, chocolates on your pillow. Hmm? 
 Got your own little piece of civilization. 
 So why don't you tell us how to get in the compound? 
 [Spits] 
 Oh. 
 Mm. 
 Now, beating on you, that's really... that's really just for me. 
 It's very therapeutic. 
 But I am a busy man, so... 
 I know, I know. 
 [Screams] 
 Oh. 
 I know. 
 You know this... this we picked up from the daughters. 
 Oh, wow. 
 This stuff will get you talking. 
 [Grunting] 
 And after, you are going to beg me to beat you again. 
 Have a nice trip, Cole. 
 So long, Cole. 
 Just keep him alive. 
 I'm not through with him yet. 
 Max! Max. 
 Max, you have to help me. 
 Or I need to just leave... without another word. 
 You'd understand that, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Deacon's just gonna wear you down. 
 You might as well tell him how to get into that place so he'll kill you faster. 
 No, I can't. 
 I can't do that. No, they're... they're gonna kill Ramse. 
 There's nothing you can do. 
 You can't change fate. 
 I need to save him. 
 Not theirs, not Ramse's. 
 Can't change... 
 The future's set. 
 Sorry, buddy. I'm in atari. 
 Ramse died for nothing. 
 The future's set. 
 I need to save him. 
 You might as well tell him how to get into that place. 
 They're gonna kill Ramse. 
 Everybody. 
 Ramse died for nothing. 
 No! 
 [Screaming] 
 You need to save him. 
 Everybody. 
 No! Max! 
 I'm sorry! 
 I'm sorry, Max. Please. 
 Please, I'm sorry. Please, help me. 
 Please, Max. Please, help me. 
 Even if I wanted to help you, Cole, how can I possibly do that? 
 Tell me. 
 You can help me. You can help me, just... there's another entrance to the compound. 
 Where? 
 It's outside of the building. 
 It's a tunnel system. 
 Okay. 
 Overgrown. You have to go there. 
 You have to warn them. Ask to speak to Ramse. 
 He'll believe you. 
 He'll believe you. 
 See? 
 Was that so hard? 
 Tell the men to get ready. 
 You got it. 
 We're moving out before dawn. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Where's Deacon? 
 Just rolled out with the rest of them. 
 Now, he said that he wanted you alive. 
 But, you know, he didn't say that you had to be all shiny and new. 
 So... oh, this is going to be good. 
 You stupid bitch! Oh! 
 What are you doing? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 You know, maybe... 
 I just want to kill you myself. 
 You gonna? 
 Maybe... because I am West 7. 
 No, you're not. 
 You never were. 
 Get me out of here. There's still time. 
 No, see, I don't owe you a damn thing. 
 No, you don't. 
 I left you here. 
 But if I'd taken you with me, I would've made you a target. 
 I never expected us to make it as far as we did. 
 Deacon wanted Ramse dead. 
 He wanted me to do it. 
 Put a bullet in my brother. 
 Oh, but you didn't. 
 No. 
 But I walked up to him, gun in hand, so what does that make me? 
 Max. 
 It doesn't have to be like this. 
 Help me take Deacon down. 
 [Groans] 
 Where's the facility? 
 This way. 
 We're gonna have to run. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Truck's just a distraction. 
 We still have time. 
 How do you know? 
 I know. 
 This ain't it. This is a diversion. 
 All right, Deacon's putting on a show. 
 Found another way in. 
 Whitley, you got men stationed at the exhaust tunnels? 
 Hey, you okay? 
 Nothing up top. 
 That wasn't much of an assault. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm okay. 
 Cole! 
 Breaching the tunnels. 
 You go that way, we don't make it in time, trust me. 
 This way. 
 Deacon's making his way to the machine. 
 What? 
 Uh, go down this hallway. 
 There's gonna be a door there. 
 Deacon will be there trying to get inside, okay? 
 There's a woman inside, a scientist. 
 You need to save her. 
 Where are you going? 
 Trust me! 
 Cole! 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 Open this door. 
 We're sealed inside the splinter chamber. 
 Deacon's right outside the door. 
 Sorry, buddy. 
 You're on your own from here on out. 
 I'm in atari. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Ramse! You all right? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 Oh, man. 
 Ramse? 
 Ramse? 
 Ramse? 
 What is this? 
 I'll explain it to you later. 
 Look, if we don't move right now, Jones is gonna die. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 [Explosion] 
 [Gunfire] 
 Come on, get up. Let's go, let's go. 
 Let's go! 
 [Chuckles] 
 West 7 are retreating. 
 Deacon's men just bailed out the sector five exit. 
 Any word on Deacon? 
 Another sweep came back... no sign of him. 
 And if he's smart, he's miles away. 
 His camp's with him. 
 But I'm sure he's going to take another shot. 
 He knows what's down there. 
 I should have let you kill him... the night we left. 
 What's done is done. 
 Not anymore. 
 We got that machine. 
 We do it right this time. 
 No. 
 Jones says the only reason that happened was the damage to the machine. 
 Short jump like that, she couldn't do it again if she wanted to. 
 Who knows? 
 Maybe things happen the way they do for a reason. 
 If that's true, then why undo it at all? 
 Jones letting Max stay? 
 Yeah. We owe her. 
 If it wasn't for her, Deacon would be king of the castle. 
 You guys gonna pick up where you left off? 
 No. No, it's not like that. 
 Right, right. 
 Cassie. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 Listen, you need help. I want you to talk to her. 
 And I want you... to bring up your friend. 
 The one who eats blondes for breakfast? 
 Yes, him. 
 Seriously... take a shot. 
 Worth the risk. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Cassie. 
 Where have you been? 
 I mean, I know where... when. 
 What took you so long? 
 It's a long story. 
 Okay, well, listen, I have been all over this. 
 And it took me a little bit longer than I would have liked because I did it by myself. 
 I know. I know. I keep doing this... coming and going. 
 Look, what you said before I left, you're right. 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 I've never really been very good at talking. 
 Cole... So if you want to know about me, I'll tell you. 
 There's a little town just outside Philadelphia. It's not that far away from here. That's where I was born. 
 Cole... I found it. I found it. I found the Night Room.
