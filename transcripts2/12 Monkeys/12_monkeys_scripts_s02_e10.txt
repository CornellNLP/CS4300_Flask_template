 Previously on "12 Monkeys"... 
 My father had plans for me. 
 I was a thing in a box. 
 The Witness in my head? 
 I saw a place called Titan. Titan only leads to death. Your friends, their rage is blinding. It's a CIA intelligence report, the only record of a place called Titan. East Germany, 1961, and a doctor named Kirschner. James Cole is loyal to a fault. You and Deacon? I don't have to like the guy  to see that he cares about you. Paradox Primaries... There's one more we don't know. 1957, Upstate New York,  a paradox so powerful, it destroys the fabric of time. [airplane engine roaring] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ It took us some time to find it. No one in our organization has set foot in here in over 50 years. I had no idea it was so important to our history. To our future. ♪ ♪ [echoing] The Witness has spoken... Madam? What happened here? Betrayal. ♪ ♪ [thunder crashes] Christ, Whitley. What are we doing out here? Jones needs more data. Yeah. You really think that more data's gonna stop that? [thunder crashing] Your silence is deafening. No one's forcing you to stay, Deacon. You could always join the rest of your men. How many was it went AWOL this week? I'd ask what's keeping you here, but we both know, don't we? Does she? [thunder crashing] Let's hurry this up. [thunder crashes] Easy! Easy! It's just a kid. Hey. You came from the camp near here? They're all gone. Your parents, they get caught in it? [thunder crashing and wind whistling] sh1t. We've got to move. Come on, kid. Hey! Whitley! [people shouting indistinctly] [wind whooshing and thunder crashing] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Mr. Whitley's team encountered another temporal storm. At this rate, these anomalies will consume this facility in just five days, if we're lucky. So what are our options? We must prevent this last paradox. Primary in '57. Are we sure that'll stop all this? These paradoxes, they're like gunshot wounds in time. We can survive the one from 1944, but this last paradox will bleed us out. Everything we know about '57 comes from the enemy. But we've picked up an enormous amount of temporal fallout between 1956 and 1958. The highest readings coincide with a single event... An explosion at the factory in New York on November 7, 1957. Hundreds of people were killed. The temporal signature indicates a massive paradox. We'd have a full year to complete the mission. We go back, do whatever we can to locate the Primary before the remaining Messengers can paradox. But if the facility's going to be destroyed in days, our real-time tethers will break, and everyone will die here. But if you succeed and stop the paradox, time will shift and undo all the destruction that has occurred here. Won't work. Nothing ever does when she plays God. We got something better. What's that? A CIA document. Most of this is redacted. Read what's not. Dr. Albert Kirschner, a war criminal captured in East Berlin on August 13, 1961, by Mossad. Mossad? Israeli Intelligence. They were hunting down former Nazis in '61. The report mentions a place called Titan and a man called The Witness. This is it. We go back to 1961, we find Kirschner before the Mossad does, we find Titan, we find The Witness, we cut the head off of the snake. That's not gonna stop the storms out there. We save the world by killing the one who destroys it. Yeah, or we die trying. We choose the wrong mission now, we don't get a second chance. We're going back to '57. You gonna make that call now? You know, we're always a step behind. For once, why don't we take the fight to them? Look who's all leap and no look now. You know what the difference is, brother? I earned it. So has she. [tense music] If I may interject, the Core has enough power for both jumps. We don't have the time, Dr. Adler. Look, I need you, both of you. I can't do this alone. One last mission to stop the paradox. After that, we will come back, find The Witness, and make him pay. I promise. Jones. You're willing to die here on the chance that maybe we can undo it? If I were being forced to bet my life on a mission, I'd prefer it would be one of hope rather than revenge. [suspenseful music] Are you with Mr. Cole or are you not? ♪ ♪ Yeah. [pensive music] We'll go. Good. Dr. Adler, splinter calculation for January 1957 will take several hours. Let's go. ♪ ♪ Ramse. You sure caved quickly. Adler, what do you think? Ha, since when did that matter to you? You know what The Witness did to her, to my son. Don't patronize me like I'm some fool, Mr. Ramse. I lost my son as well in the plague. I, too, know what it's like to be denied retribution every single day. So help me. Help me right that wrong. Well, I'm sorry to inform you, but I'm not in charge of these missions. I only program them. [knock at door] Cassie? Hey. Hi. I, uh... I heard you're taking a trip to 1957? I just wanted to say good-bye, I guess. Um... Um, there's something I never told you. I remember you, from before, when I was a kid. Dr. Cassandra Railly from the CDC. When the plague hit, you were... You were on the TV 24-7, and... [sighs] Many lonely nights were spent watching those emerald greens. [melancholy music] It was enough to make you forget that the whole planet was going to sh1t. So I just wanted to say... that I, um... that, uh... you mean a lot... Deacon. [whispers] Stop. It was just one night. You came to me. Because we were trapped out there, surrounded by scavs. My respirator had a hole in it, and... Oh. Look, that part of me is long gone. It has to be. That's the only way I can do this. Got it. I will say this: you finally fit in around this place. [door clicks open and closed] Coordinates are set. Emerson Hotel, New York City, January 3, 1957. One year, James. One year. I... Don't worry. We got this. [pensive music] ♪ ♪ [stirring orchestral music] [machine whirring] Initiate splinter sequence. [whirring and beeping] [whooshing and whirring] ♪ ♪ [sighs] We need new clothes. We're getting looks. [exhales] Want a drink? Why not? [man singing indistinctly] Hey, listen, uh... I'm sorry about before. I know... I made the call, but... thank you both for being here. Yeah, no worries. Of course. I know we've had our differences in the past, but, uh, having you two here at the end of all this... means a lot to me. I'll drink to that. Cheers, buddy. Cheers. ♪ Up till dawn when things... ♪ Whoa. [laughs] Didn't know it was that kind of party. Bottoms up, Cole. ♪ People think I'm... [sighs] That's smooth. It's good, huh? Mmm. Yeah. Beats what we used to drink with the West 7. That's for sure. Ah. Pruno. Pruno. Booze made from prunes, right? It was, like, 180 proof. [all laughing] [clears throat] Without economic, political, or police pressure... Is it hot in here? To make their own choice... You all right? I don't know. And live their own lives. The people of West Berlin today have that freedom. The general problem that the United States faces in the security field in the summer of 1961... [foreboding music] What year is this? [grunts] Hey, hey, it's okay. Ugh. You're okay. That they will continue to enjoy it. What did you do to me? I'm sorry, Cole. Come on. [echoing] We had to. [winces] [foreboding music] [groans] ♪ ♪ [groans lightly] ♪ ♪ [sighs] sh1t. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [clattering] ♪ ♪ Operator. How can I direct your call? FBI, please, New York office. One moment, please. Christ. Look at you. You haven't aged a goddamn day. I wish I could say the same. [both chuckle] [indistinct chatter] Okay. That, uh, woman from '44, the genetically enhanced Messenger, I got a lead on her a couple years ago, but I lost the trail somewhere in Europe. And, yeah, I... I took it hard. Wife left. I got a grandkid I don't see. She's probably better off. Knowing the world's gonna end makes a man, uh, gloomy. Yeah. [light jazz music] Well, listen. My friends... Yeah, uh, ran a trace on passports out of Idlewild. Two came up phony. They touched down at Berlin Tempelhof Airport an hour ago. Can you spot me a ticket and a passport? Not enough to drug me. They had to rob me too. Nefarious characters seem to coalesce around you like bum hairs in a drain. That's colorful. Look, Cole, these, uh, so-called friends of yours are running headlong into a bad situation. This doctor they're after, Kirschner, the former Nazi, he's been on the run since Nuremberg. Mossad wants him to pay badly for his war crimes. They got a bead on him last month in East Berlin. They pull the trigger on him, he's headed back to Israel for trial, but now that the wall's going up, it's not gonna be so easy. What do you mean? The East Germans are building a wall straight through the middle of the city. If they can't get him out, capture may turn to kill for Mossad, and if your friends get between the Israelis and this asshole... We better hurry. [chuckles] You know, Cole, I've known you a long time now. What do you mean? We met once in '44, right? Right. M-my p... My point is, I'm afraid your loyalty is gonna bite you in the ass one of these days. Sometimes you got to go it alone. You might be right. But right now, I'm broke, and I don't speak German. Will you help me? Wo ist die Toilette? [chuckles] Let's go get these sons of bitches. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [man singing operatically] Keep your eyes open. They could be anywhere. Here. You want to wake up? We did what we did. [indistinct chatter] [sighs] Yeah. The report says Mossad grabs Kirschner when the show lets out. We need to get to him before they do. Here. [singing continues] Uh, excuse me. [speaking indistinctly] [singing continues] [dramatic orchestral music] ♪ ♪ [man singing operatically] Herr Doktor Voland. [singing continues] [racing string music] ♪ ♪ [sprightly orchestral music] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ See? It worked. Those two aren't a happy couple. Mossad. ♪ ♪ Stay here. What are you doing? Buying you time to grab Kirschner. No wonder they get along. ♪ ♪ Excuse me. Do you speak English? Nein. Tut mir leid. Entschuldigen Sie. I'm sorry. It's just... I'm terribly confused. I don't speak any German. Keep moving, asshole. Keep moving. Is this the "Staatsoper Unter den Linden"? Move. We don't have time. Stop! ♪ ♪ [tires screeching] [guns clicking] Put it down! ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] Ramse. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ [thud] Ah! [grunts] ♪ ♪ We have to do something. They're gonna kill him. Shut up. [grunts] Sit. [sighs] [sniffs] [whimpering] [grunts] [thudding] Ah! Ah! [whimpering] [gun clicks] [whimpers] English? Ja. [whimpers] Anything but German. I despise it. I don't know those people! You've made a mistake. My name is Dr. Steffen Voland. I work at a clinic. [growling] I help children. What about the children at Mauthausen? [thudding] Auschwitz? [Kirschner whimpering] We don't want Kirschner. You can have him. Just want to ask him a question. He knows about a place called Titan and a man who calls himself The Witness. You just let us talk to him, and then you can do whatever you want. You... are... Kirschner. [grunting and gagging] You're not CIA. We put in a call. They never heard of you. So now what we will find out is, who do you work for, and how did you find the doctor? [grunting and gagging] There are two types of trial. Ones that take place in a court of law... [grunts] [groans] [gurgling] And ones that take place... [both grunt] [heavy smack] In rooms like this. [gasping and gagging] [suspenseful music] 
 
 [engine revving, indistinct chatter] [airplane engine roaring] [sighs] My contact says your friends stumbled onto a Mossad surveillance op in East Berlin. They've been detained. sh1t. Mossad and the CIA station chief have been going back and forth all day. They've got your friends pegged as Nazi sympathizers. What's gonna happen to 'em? Mossad's gonna make Kirschner disappear. My guess is your friends disappear with him. Can you get me across the border? I've got visas for you and me, but getting your friends out isn't gonna be so easy. I have to try. 1961? What have you done? I've encrypted their return sequence. They'll be back in four days. But then we are out of time! Our best option is to find and kill The Witness. So you will just have to wait as I've waited for ten years for what you promised! To save my son, save all of us, not kill us first. [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ Lock Dr. Adler in his quarters. [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ [both grunting] [both panting] [footsteps tap] [grunts] [tense music] ♪ ♪ You kill him? Not yet. He is resting. ♪ ♪ We asked the CIA about this Titan. They have never heard of it. So what is it? Code? Buenos Aires? Sao Paulo? Bogotá? Locations for his Nazi friends? We don't have anything to do with them. Hmm. [squishing] ♪ ♪ [squishing] [clicks tongue] [grunts] [chuckles] You have a high tolerance for pain. What about your partner? There's something about men and women in fieldwork... The closeness, the danger... [whispers] Gets their blood up. [sighs] You get attached. She is very beautiful. No one would fault you. You hurt her, I kill you. [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ Who are you working for? No one. [groans] Where were you taking Dr. Kirschner? We're hunting someone, same as you. [grunts] Hey! [groans] [coughs] [spits] Someone who's killed a lot of people, and that man in there can tell us where to find him. [coughing] I'm gonna hurt you real bad. [chuckles] [glass shatters] [both grunting] [door bangs] [dramatic music] [all grunting] [grunts] Ah! [all grunting] [sighs] Cole. Save it. We have to go. We found Kirschner. He's here. Good. He can stay. We're leaving. We got to find Titan first. He doesn't know. You got to get out of my way. Hey. I saw the report, unredacted. The only reason it mentions Titan is because you two said it. You created your own clue, genius. You're chasing your own tail. Titan. Hey. Hey, look at me! Titan. Where is it? I don't know what it is. Please. Hey. Hey. Come on. Cassie. What's wrong with you? Huh? Okay, I get it. The Witness got in your head. He used you. You're out for blood, but you're blind. You can't even see this guy doesn't know anything. He has to. Hey! Oh. [light metallic clinking] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Who's blind now? [sighs] It's the mark of The Witness. Almost a lifetime ago, I was a student. A man who witnessed the future came to me,  urged me to continue my work in eugenics,  promised me insights to further my research. And then... He warned me of the war, of the things I would be asked to do in the camps. [sobs] Horrible. Didn't stop you. It was my purpose, a means to an end, for the good of the world. Doesn't sound like Nazi doctrine to me. You see, there is a great plague coming. [chuckles] So I've heard. In this next century, the survival of mankind will depend on immunity. Immunity is random. There's no genetic marker. Hmm. For most in the natural world, perhaps. But for those who are bred, created, they would be stronger, faster, immune to all disease... Aging, the effects of time itself. "Created"? You made a human being? [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ H.G. Wells. Or Mary Shelley. You remember in '44, the Messenger, she mentioned someone called The Father? [echoing] He made us too well. "He made us." [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Your work creates the Messengers. And the Messengers destroy the world. ♪ ♪ No, please. Oh. Hey. He can lead us to The Witness. No. Please. The Witness... He lied to you. No. You're wrong. He wouldn't. Cole... James Cole? You know my name? The Witness spoke of you a great deal. Where is your research now? In my lab in West Berlin. The sample is there, unfinished but safe. If we could destroy it... We could keep the Messengers from ever existing in the first place, stop the paradoxes, all of it. If you spare me, I will take you to it. But we must hurry. The Witness has people, people who watch me. To them, my work is everything. If they think I am missing... they will come. Got to figure out a way to cross the wall. There's a way. [indistinct chatter, dogs barking] [man yelling indistinctly] sh1t. [men speaking in German] They must have just posted these assholes. They're still building the wall here. We can get through. Just stay low. [whispers] Follow me. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [whispering] Okay, somebody's got to go in first, pry it open. You'll be exposed. [whispers] I'll go. I'll do it. I said I got it. Jesus Christ, you two swingin' dicks, enough with the bravado. Here. Don't make a goddamn sound.

I got a granddaughter. Two years old. You know what I see when I look at her? I see a little girl who's already dead. Her world dies, and there's not a goddamn thing I can do about it. But you can, Cole. [men shouting in German] Sometimes you just have to go it alone. Gale. Gale! [gunshots] [dramatic music] [gunfire] Ah! [gunshots] [man shouts indistinctly] [gunfire] ♪ ♪ [distorted gunshot] ♪ ♪ How long? Minutes now. It's rebooting. Prepare for splinter retrieval. [indistinct chatter] [whirring] [man shouting indistinctly] Where is Gale? [grunts and sighs] You can still get what you want, Cole. We put a bullet in Kirschner, we destroy all his research, we all win here. Yeah. Why don't I go back and tell Gale how lucky we are? [somber music] ♪ ♪ My lab is through here. [panting] What you're about to see... if what you say is true... Do not be weakened by sympathy. [exhales] [switch clicks, lights click] [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ What is this? My work. ♪ ♪ The sample. This child? Why is she in a box? This is no mere child. No child should have strength like this. ♪ ♪ We needed to teach her discipline, control through confinement. You made her? My research was just theory. Then The Witness sent me a woman. She was different. Perfect. I used her eggs as research. There is something else you need to see. [ominous musical flourish] ♪ ♪ What is that? [dramatic music] The written word of The Witness. ♪ ♪ If there's anything about your Titan, it would be here. Ja. [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [grunts] [gunshots] [screams] [gunshots] The Witness will be disappointed by your betrayal, Father. [gunshots] [groans] [gunshots] My love, some people want to hurt you, but I won't let them. Where's Father? Mother is here now. You have a purpose, dear, a very special one. [muffled gunshots] [somber music] ♪ ♪ [gunshots] [glass shattering] [gunshots] I can't stop the bleeding. We can't let them take her. We need that! The girl is everything. [gunshots] [indistinct chatter, electronic beep] Back online. Initiate return sequence. [whirring] [gunshots, glass shattering] It's happening. [warbling tone] [groans] [gunshots] We're out of time, Ramse. I need your help. [dramatic music] [gunshots] [grunting] Car's out back! Get the girl out now! [echoing metallic clinking] [gunshots] She's getting away. ♪ ♪ [gunshots] What are you doing? ♪ ♪ What are you doing? ♪ ♪ [warbling tone] God damn it, Ramse! [gunshots] [warbling tone] [foreboding music] This will be your home now. What do you think? Where's Father? His cycle has ended, sweetling. But he wanted you to have this. Mother will take care of you now, and you'll have a big brother to look after you too. How does that sound? Don't fret, my love. We're in his hands now. Who? The Witness. He will show you a world without pain, without death, no beginning, no end. Doesn't that sound beautiful? He will take care of you, and he will never, ever leave you. I don't understand. Mm. Hmm. You will. Your father did many important things, but you know what his greatest accomplishment was? Mm. Why, it's you, Olivia. ♪ ♪ [echoing] You have a purpose, Olivia. You're special.

This isn't right. Do it! Cole... Your mission is over. Hey, you can't make that call. You made the call, in '61. You're done, both of you. Whitley, do your job.
