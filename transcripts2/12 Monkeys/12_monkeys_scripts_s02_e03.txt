 Previously on 12 Monkeys... 
 She said I was Primary. 
 You are Primary. 
 Things I see... 
 Changes made in time. 
 Primary. 
 I see everything. 
 We destroyed the virus. 
 I apologize, Dr. Eckland. 
 You were not part of my original reality. 
 What are you doing? Deacon's gonna kill him there! 
 Not before he tells us everything he knows. 
 Those Messengers out there in the hoods... what do they want? 
 The machine. 
 We don't know where they went or when. 1944... that's where I think the Messengers went. [Bing Crosby's "Pistol Packin' Mama"] ♪ Lay that pistol down, babe ♪

♪ To come with me and take a ride ♪ In the last eight months, ever since the Messengers used our machine, we've had tremendous spikes across the temporal spectrum. Yeah, I'm aware. But last night's data showed these anomalies multiplying in the time-stream... an increase of 80%. These levels are unprecedented. It's almost as if the structure of space-time is collapsing somehow... It's what? Collapsing onto itself. Dr. Eckland! Dr. Eckland! If you please... ♪ ♪ [music stops] Forgive me for asking, but I understand Dr. Eckland has moved out of your quarters. As far as the time-stream goes, I don't know what is causing those anomalies. Everything seems to be increasingly unpredictable. My suggestion is we all just get used to the new normal. Oh! Come on, get up! Yeah! Yes! Oh! Get up! What are you... Cole! Yeah! Get up. Yes! Yeah! Kick him. Hey! What the hell is this? What the hell is this? Jones promised me this bullshit was over! You raise your voice to her again, and I will chew your goddamn face off. It's all right. It's all right. Yeah, it's all right. Go nurse your wounds, Teddy. Stop it, both of you. We're trying to figure out where the Messengers went in the machine. And your boyfriend is holding out on us. They didn't fill me in on a whole lot, including the part where they tried to kill me. He's the asshole that brought them here in the first place. Mea culpa. We stopped their plan to release the virus. Whatever's going on now, he's got nothing to do with. And what about 1944? What about it? Nice tux. This is a relationship I will never understand. You should hear what you just said. Oh, you sore about us? Hey, guys. I trained her to survive, just like I trained you. I'll tell you something... she's got a lot of talent. Except for that blind spot when it comes to pieces of sh1t like you. What is that supposed to mean? Hey! I know what this is. Professor Thomas H. Crawford, molecular biologist... during the Second World War, he was one of a small number of American scientists who belonged to something called the War Bureau of Consultants. The group was charged with investigating the feasibility of a U.S. bio-weapons program. Looks like Crawford was murdered in his office at Columbia University on the evening of September 1, 1944. His killers... a man and a woman... were never found. What does this have to do with the 12 Monkeys or the plague? I remember there was a time that they were looking for the grave of Thomas Crawford. I thought about digging him up. Exhume his remains? For what purpose? I don't know. Test for DNA. Maybe use it to track Crawford to a specific time and place. Yeah. September 1, 1944. We have to go back. We were there. You were also there in 1987. But that little trip didn't work out like anyone hoped. Look, they went back and killed Crawford. We have to stop them and find out what they were up to. Could be his research. It might be their plan B for the virus. They might know something. Crawford lived decades before anyone understood the basics of RNA propagation. His work would have been useless to the Monkeys. Maybe he was ahead of his time, and they killed him before he got a chance to prove it. [exhales deeply] We should go. To 1944? You want to just travel back through time 100 years to a world at war where people were paranoid and archaic? Cole can barely navigate 2016. I'm standing right here. That's why I'd like you to accompany him. You've seen the Messengers, seen their faces. You can identify them before they strike. The fight against the plague starts in 2016. The first battle may very well have been in 1944. I'm not a time traveler. Dr. Railly, I understand this is quite a change in dynamic... but he needs you to guide him through that world. Katarina... If Mr. Cole fails... we all fail. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Our reports show that Professor Crawford was murdered in his office while a military ceremony was taking place on campus. The Secretary of War was handing out medals to war heroes. Well, if the Messengers found a way in, so can we. We've done it before. This will require a plan. On the ground. No, not on the ground, Johnny Night Room. We need a plan now. Are we sneaking in, going undercover? Bribe... we need money. Money won't be a problem. Here they're worthless. In 1944, their street value will be substantial. Trade it. Pawn it. Wear it, if you like. You've never splintered one person, let alone two, this far back. No, and with the increase of temporal anomalies, the science has become even more inexact. The two of you could arrive hours apart, maybe days. So I'd suggest a rendezvous point. Emerson Hotel... West 43rd. Okay. [scoffs] He's done a number on her, huh? You sure it's not the other way around? Mr. Deacon is a necessary evil. Security of this facility is paramount. What about Ramse? I'll have a word with Mr. Deacon. Mr. Ramse was helpful today. Then show him that matters. Let him see his son. [device beeping] Coordinates are set for Manhattan, 1944. The window is holding. Core is at maximum and steady. Give the word. Initiate splinter sequence. It's been a while since I heard that. [alarm blaring] [machine whirring loudly] You're up. Be careful. Behave. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Match coordinates. Follow sequence. [machine whirring loudly] [alarm blaring] You all right, miss? Miss? Did you hit your head? [air-raid siren wails] Quickly, inside. What's happening? Air raid. Probably just a drill, but one can never be sure. This way, into the theater. No, I can't. I have to meet someone. I'll be all right. Find shelter as soon as you can. [siren continues wailing] [indistinct chatter] [horn honks] [indistinct chatter] [telephone ringing] Miss... the Emerson has a strict dress code. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. It's all right. The lady's with me. Mr. Cole. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize she was your, uh... Wife. Mrs. Cassandra Cole. Thanks. Nice suit. They don't give rooms to couples unless they're married. You had me worried. The party's tonight. I thought you might not make it. How long have you been here? Two months. It's all right. It gave me a chance to get things ready. I sold off a bunch of that jewelry. Money's not a problem. Good. I need clothes. I'm drawing attention. I took care of that too. The salesgirl figured your size when I showed her this. I got a couple other dresses for you upstairs too. Hey, you want to sit down, grab a drink or something? I've been drinking whiskey sours. You ever have one of those? Oh, my God. You like it here. [scoffs] What's not to like? [whispering] We need a plan to get into a secure military function during wartime. And I got us on the guest list with a generous donation to the Columbia Alumni Society. I'm on top of it. Just relax. Try to have some fun. [normal voice] This isn't a vacation. [scoffs] Mr. Cole? Yes. Telephone. For me? He asked for James Cole. Hello? [static whirring] Hello? [receiver clicks] Nothing. My apologies, sir. There was a man on the line. It sounded urgent. All right, thanks, Dan. What are you doing? This picture's gonna be taken tonight. It could risk causing a paradox if there are two of them. You should burn those. Where are you going? To get ready. We have work to finish. [scoffs] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [John Philip Sousa's "The Liberty Bell"] ♪ ♪ Recognize anyone? James. I'm so delighted you made it. I am so delighted you could squeeze us in. This is Cassandra Cole, my, uh... Sister. Janice Thompson with the Alumni Society. We are so grateful for your brother's generous donation. That's a lovely necklace. Thank you. Don't you just love it? A gift from your brother. He is such a catch. We had to get on the list. [camera shutter clicks] Hey, folks, how about a big smile, huh? Could get you in "Stars and Stripes." Oh, come on, sweetheart. You can do better than that. [camera shutter clicks] Perfect. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Guess that's out of the way. ♪ ♪ Where are you going? Drink. Keep your eyes open. I don't think Director Hoover would approve of you drinking while we're on a detail. Take a look around. More Gis here than the whole European Theater. Jerry's not dumb enough to crash this party. No reason not to keep our wits. One of these eggheads might just help us win the war. ♪ ♪ Ahh. I got to hit the john. Whiskey sour. Uncle Sam rationing razor blades now? Huh? The beard. This is New York City, not the Appalachians. You walk two blocks, you'll run into at least three barbershops. I'm going someplace cold. Someplace cold? Like the North Pole? Who we fighting there, Shirley? Excuse me? I'm just busting your balls. You just getting back? From where? Over there. You got the look... man who's seen things. Yeah, I've seen a few things. So who are you with... Army, Marines? The Seventh. Seventh Infantry? No sh1t. North Africa. ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 The ashes of yesterday, washed away. You are prepared. Your mission is clear. Listen, I really don't want to talk about it. As former Gis, we have an obligation to share our stories here. Listen, asshole, I'm just trying to have a drink. There you are, James. Is my brother troubling you? Not at all. I just want to hear about this Seventh he was stationed with, what with him being a war hero and all. My brother was in the Philippines in '42. Bataan? He fought the Japanese for three months straight before he was taken prisoner and forced to march 60 miles from Mariveles to San Fernando. When he finally escaped, he was shot twice, including... down there. So you will forgive him if he doesn't want to share his stories. I'm sorry, kid. Goddamn Japs. No hard feelings? No hard feelings. Why did it have to be down there? I found one of the Messengers. She's with Crawford. There. [keys jingling] ♪ ♪ [lock clicks] Oh, sh1t. It's locked. Come on. What's wrong? I have a wife, a son. I won't tell if you won't. 414. [faintly] Flowers have the most beautiful of cycles... seed, rebirth... [normal voice] Flowers have the most beautiful of cycles... seed, rebirth, seed, rebirth. No beginning, no end, no death, no blood to wash away. Both : Destruction, decomposition, chaos, order, growth, life eternal. This is not death. There is no death. It is only the passing of time that fools us into believing that we are not forever. [muffled whimpering] Shh. We shall meet again in the red forest. [muffled screaming] Why didn't it happen? He isn't the primary. We have the right name, but the wrong man. ♪ ♪ sh1t. We're too late. Jasmine, lavender... look familiar? This is some kind of ritual. Cole, we got to get out of here. Why him? What's the connection? Cassie. What the hell is this doing here? Are you kidding me? You got good at this. You win fair and square. All right, I want round two. I'm gonna teach you a lesson. Where did you go... after Mom...? I went away. Did you do something bad? Is that why they have you in here? Somebody tell you that? I had to do something. I had to do something for you. What? [door opens] Samuel. [door closes] [whispering] Did you tell him? No. Children shouldn't be burdened with the business of adults. Your presence is affecting the balance of power in this facility. You're telling me that you can't stop Deacon from killing me. That's bullshit. I've loved very few in my life... My father, a husband briefly, and my daughter... all three murdered by a disease in which you had a part. Why? To save the life of your child whom your barely knew? You created time travel. Save your daughter. You of all people should understand. Understanding does not lessen my contempt for you. My selfishness was in line with saving billions of lives. Yours was bent to destroy them. I cannot protect you here. If this mission's to continue, balance has to be restored. Well, since I'm gonna be dying soon, you gonna tell Cole what you did to me? There is a difference between what I'm choosing to do and what I'm unable to prevent. Mr. Cole will have to accept that it was the latter. My son? Samuel will always have a place with us. I want to see him one last time. [cell door closes] You just did. [door opens] Yes, sir. Sir, we believe the suspects may have my badge. Yes, sir. U-understood. [slams phone] NYPD just found two more bodies... Glennis and Russell Applebaum. Goddamn war hero and his wife... they were supposed to be there last night. The shitheel with the blonde and the pecker sob story are unaccounted for, so it's got to be them. So then what's with the flowers... some kind of ritual? Yeah, or a couple of Axis spies trying to make killing one of our scientists look like something else. You do realize how bad this is for us if we don't find these two? Really bad? Yeah. Christ. Come on. It's over. We failed. They killed Crawford. We have no leads. We have to just wait for Jones to splinter us back to 2044 and regroup. Wait a minute. What's this? Psych evaluations... for Thomas Crawford, Junior. Crawford's son. These go back to the 1930s. Why would he want to hide his son's medical records? Maybe he didn't want people knowing his son was mentally ill. Like Leland with Jennifer. This kid had a lot of problems in school. He heard voices, suffered from delusions... diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic. Where is he now? Mission Cross Mental Asylum... outside Newark. [sighs] He drew this when he was just a little kid. This isn't a coincidence. He's connected to all this somehow. The Messengers made a mistake. They killed the wrong Crawford. Tommy and his father have the same name. When they figure this out, they're gonna go after him. Cole. Locked up for delusions and voices in the head... that sound like anybody we know? Jennifer Goines. Yes, she's crazy too. How is this news? She's not just crazy. She's... She's what? Special? Yeah. She is. Maybe Tommy is too. Look, you might not like Jennifer... I might not like her? You think that's my problem? I don't know. What is your problem? I can't trust you. Simple as that. I don't have time for this. Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to go back and finish the mission? Because hate to break it to you, but that's not really your strong suit. You can't do what needs to be done. Oh, this again? I can't get the job done... just kill everybody? That doesn't work, Cassie. What about Aaron? It worked for him. That's not fair. Aaron died... Aaron died protecting me... from you. You think I don't know what I cost you? Look, there's every reason to think that the Messengers are gonna go after this kid. They find him, they're gonna kill him. Now, you and me together can stop them. So what do you want to do? Titan... everyone dies. Everyone lives. Everyone dies. Primaries see. Monkeys don't. Green to red. Everything changes. Primaries see. Mother becomes a daughter. The Witness sees all. Melting down. Everything changes. The boy is gone. Is he? The boy is gone. The Monkeys are coming for the Witness. [distant gunshots] The Monkeys are coming for me. The Monkeys are coming. They're finally coming. They're finally here. [bird squawking] [instrumental music playing] ♪ ♪ Hello? Cole. This just happened. He's in room 313. [intense music] ♪ ♪ [groaning] Go back to sleep, princess. Late again. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ He knew they were coming. He picked the lock. [sighs] What the hell is that? A red forest. How is any of this possible? How can he know? Jennifer calls it... being primary. Primary? They're connected to time somehow. They're not just crazy. The delusions, voices in their head... they're real. What does all this have to do with a plague that ends the world? Maybe the plague's only part of their plan. [distant gunshots] Cassie, no. [gunshots] Your weapons. You don't belong here. Neither of you do. Where is the boy? They don't know. Move. ♪ ♪ [gun cocks] Take the shot. She won't. She can't. [elevator bell dings] sh1t! Cassandra. Cassandra hates to travel. How do you know my name? James Cole. This was not meant to be. You shouldn't be here. Don't worry. Cassandra won't forsake you. [grunts] Do you know how important you are? No, not yet. How could you? [chuckles] Hmm. [grunting] [muffled] What are you doing? [machine humming] [siren wailing] Listen to me. You're gonna walk out that front door with your hands over your head and give yourself up. No, no. Tommy, the police will protect you. I had to protect you. That woman kills me today, not you... with her dagger made of bone... this bone, mine. It's your grave they dig up in the future, not your father's. Yes! The Witness has spoken. I can hear him. I die today, and his world of chaos and his forest of red will come to be. The Messengers... they need me dead. Why? Because of what's in here. I help it think, just like your friend Jennifer. Poor Jennifer. We keep the lines straight, the circles circling. We're the synapses in its noggin, its mind, interconnecting. Tommy, I don't understand. Cassandra...  listen. [electricity zapping] [muffled screaming] Fourth floor, east wing. Bring the boy. [electricity zapping] [muffled screaming] You're gonna save him. I'll help you. I'm not turning you over to that woman. She'll kill you. It can't be stopped. Tommy, there's no such thing as fate. ♪ ♪ Let's go. [thunder rumbles] We are here. [thunder rumbles] Let's go. [somber music] ♪ ♪ [eerie rattling] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ All clear. Send the boy. Cole first. Don't do it, Cass. The boy. It's all right. I'll go.

[thunder rumbles] [eerie rattling] [eerie rattling] They're gonna kill him. It was his grave they dug up. She has a knife made from his bone. They're creating a paradox. [clanging] Flowers have the most beautiful of cycles... seed, rebirth, seed, rebirth. No beginning, no end, no death, no blood to wash away. That's far enough. Destruction, decomposition, chaos, order, growth, life eternal. You know the drill. We shall meet again, in the red forest. This is not death. There is no death. It is only the passing of time that fools us into believing we are not forever. ♪ ♪ [gasps] [eerie humming] [breathing heavily] [alarm beeping rapidly] Real-time tachyon readings just shot off the scale! A paradox. Larger than anything we've seen. We're losing their tethers! Both of them? [machine beeps] We've lost their connection. Oh, James, Cassie. Those temporal anomalies that we've been tracking... this is it. This is their origin. [eerie rattling] What the hell? Aah! Aah! Aah! [rattling continues] Aah! Aah! What the hell is happening here? I don't know. Move! ♪ ♪ What on God's green Earth happened here? [thunder rumbles]
