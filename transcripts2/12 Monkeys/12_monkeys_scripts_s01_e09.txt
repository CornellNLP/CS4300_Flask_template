 Cole : Previously on  12 Monkeys... 
 The core is dead. 
 It can't be repaired. 
 There's only one place we can find one. 
 If I go now, I'll be there by morning. 
 If we hit resistance, it'll come from Foster's head of security... my father. 
 I require your entire core. 
 We need the core. 
 This cure is not a memory. 
 There is no cure. 
 Elena? What are you doing here? 
 The 7 were hunting you. It wasn't safe. 
 I would have protected you. 
 It wasn't me I was worried about. 
 Jose, this is Sam, your son. 
 What year is this? 
 2017. 
 Excuse me? 
 Excuse me, can you tell me how all this started? 
 Can you tell me how people got sick? 
 [woman shouts] 
 man : This is an international multi-cast from the American CDC. 
 Cassie : The death toll stands at 31 million in the U.S. 
 Worldwide causalities are unknown. 
 There's still hope. 
 As you can see, doctors at the Baltimore CDC are working day and night to develop a vaccine. 
 Cassie. 
 We won't stop until we have one. 
 But we can't do it alone. 
 If you're one of the immune, you're vital to our research. 
 Do not go to the Atlanta CDC, please. 
 It's no longer operational. 
 Come to Baltimore. 
 We need your help. 
 I'm aware of a dangerous rumor that is spreading through this facility. 
 Contrary to what you may've heard, Colonel Foster did not find a cure to the plague. 
 This is the 2033 mutation of the virus... a second iteration of the original plague. 
 Foster's basing his research on the first mutation, not the current one. 
 But the virus has mutated twice more since 2033. 
 Now it is an entirely unique microorganism... something quite alien... something we'll probably never fully understand. 
 His vaccine won't work. 
 Jones : Foster lied. 
 Why? 
 Because it gives his people hope... just as it gave you. 
 So that his obsession to find a cure, his work, can continue. 
 Our mission is paramount. 
 Mr. Cole is lost in time, and he will remain there unless we can power our machine. 
 And for that, we need Spearhead's core. 
 How do you want to do this? 
 Elena : Now what are you gonna do? 
 Sam : I keep taking... 
 He said he needed to see you. 
 Look at this. 
 Hey, buddy, I'm gonna borrow your mom for a second. 
 I'm gonna bring her back. I promise. 
 All right? Thanks, partner. 
 I got to get you out of here. 
 I'm gonna set you up at the facility. 
 We got to leave now. 
 What? 
 Foster lied to you. 
 Jones said that it's all bullshit. 
 He cured the wrong virus. 
 No. 
 I saw it. I was in the lab when he did it. 
 I don't know what you saw. 
 Jose... this is our home. 
 This is a cult. 
 His sermons, they're all false hope. 
 It's Deacon all over again. 
 Let me take care of you. Let me take care of our son. 
 You are wrong about Foster. 
 I'm going to prove it to you. 
 I'm not going to have time. 
 Cole's stuck back there. I got to do something. 
 I'm gonna lose him. 
 Cole : We're lost, Ramse. 
 I don't even know why we're running. 
 We haven't seen Deacon or the 7 in years. 
 Ramse : We always got to run, brother. 
 My hands are numb. 
 [exhaling sharply] 
 [groans] 
 Here. 
 [groans] Thanks. 
 Find you another pair before winter. 
 Frostbite's a bitch. 
 Yeah, I'm not worried about it. 
 We're going to starve to death first, anyway. 
 We'll find something. We always do. 
 Jose Ramse... master of bullshit. 
 What's your deal now? 
 What's my deal? 
 My balls are like ice. 
 We're starving. 
 We got no food. We got no winter gear. 
 We got no ammo. 
 Well, if you stop bitching... just one minute... [chuckles] maybe I could think of something. 
 Maybe you could think of something? 
 Yeah. 
 [chuckles] That's good. 
 Look... we're screwed. 
 Simple as that. 
 You been to Florida? 
 No. 
 Florida, that's... that's the place for us, brother. 
 Next winter we're gonna be on a beach. 
 Only thing hotter than the sun are the girls. 
 [chuckles] 
 The Florida Keys, huh? 
 Saw a picture of that once. 
 Looked nice. 
 [gunshot] 
 [distant chatter] 
 I think we can take them. 
 There's six of them. 
 I can count. 
 We're not gonna make it to Florida. 
 You know that, right? 
 Yeah, we are. 
 No, we're not. 
 I'm done. I'm tired. 
 [sighs] 
 We gonna do this or what? 
 Yeah. 
 man : Let's go. Come on. 
 Great idea. 
 Hey, if you had a better one, you could've spoken up. 
 You must be the stupidest sons of bitches I've ever seen. 
 General and lieutenant of a two-man army. 
 Where are we? 
 Where the hell is this place? 
 Wouldn't you like to know, shithead? 
 That's "General" to you, dickhead. 
 Hey! 
 Cole! Cole! 
 man : Dr. Railly, can you talk about the quarantine zones the CDC's set up? 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 If you're not showing symptoms of the Kala-virus... these zones are sealed... [shouting in background] so the uninfected can take shelter. 
 You will need to undergo a series of tests. 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 [crying, shouting in native language] 
 [shouting in native language] 
 Cole : Let me through. Let me through. 
 Hey! I need to get through, I'm immune. I'm immune! 
 So am I! I have it... 
 Hey! I need to get to the U.S.! 
 I'm an American! 
 Only immune allowed. 
 I'm not sick! Hey, I'm not sick! 
 What are you doing? 
 [speaking native language] 
 Mr. Cole. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 U.S. Army. 
 We have a chopper to take you to the airport. 
 How do you know my name? 
 I'm not authorized to explain that to you. 
 What the hell? 
 You want to get to the U.S. or not? 
 [soldiers marching, shouting in distance] 
 Dad? 
 We need to talk. 
 We don't have time for this. We got to go. 
 I need to find something. 
 Make it quick. 
 [beeping, door opens] 
 Elena. 
 Mr. Ramse. 
 You looking for something? 
 I'm sorry, Dad, but it's true. 
 And why should I believe you? 
 I'm your son. 
 You haven't been, not for 10 years. 
 Now, why should things be different? 
 'Cause I saw the people you killed for Foster, and it took me 10 years to understand why. 
 That faith you have in him? 
 Look, maybe I don't deserve that faith... but neither does Foster. 
 This isn't necessary. 
 Colonel, we were just looking for Samuel's stuffed rabbit. 
 Yeah, I'm familiar with it, huh? 
 I'm the one that gave it to him, right? 
 Along with a home. 
 And now you're here with him? 
 What did she offer you? You working for her? 
 We're not working for anyone. 
 And you... the only reason I allowed you to return was for them. 
 Maybe Katarina anticipated that. 
 Jones didn't send me. 
 Then what were you looking for? 
 [beeping, door opens] 
 man : Colonel. 
 There's someone at the gate. 
 [sighs] 
 All right, you guys come with me. 
 [beeping, door opens] 
 Jose, what is going on? 
 We got to get out of here. Remember how to pick a lock? 
 Well, it's been a while, but... 
 None of this would've happened if your people hadn't come here. 
 We had to. 
 Okay. You're gonna be okay, little guy, all right? 
 [people shouting] 
 What's going on out there? 
 Everyone just wants a cure. 
 There won't be one. 
 You're immune too. 
 Guess we're the lucky ones. 
 You ever wonder why? Why us? 
 They'll find a cure. 
 They have to. 
 Sorry about your husband. 
 man : This is an international multi-cast from the American CDC. 
 This is Dr. Cassandra Railly of the Baltimore CDC. 
 A seventh quarantine zone has been established in West Manhattan. 
 If you're within this area, you may go to the Western 7 zone for safety. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 I have him. 
 Jonathan. 
 What are you doing here, Kat? 
 Sit. 
 Let's not waste each other's time. 
 Unless you accept my offer for the core, my guards will show you out. 
 I'm not here to bargain with you. 
 I'm here to give you one last chance. 
 I caught one of your men in my lab. 
 Jose Ramse? 
 To what end did you send him? 
 Jones : I sent no one. 
 Jonathan, let me show you the machine, and then you will see... 
 Seeing a machine is not going to make me believe in blasphemy. 
 Time has not changed you. 
 Go home, Kat. 
 Consider my offer. 
 But don't ask again for my core. 
 I'm not here to ask. 
 I will have your core. 
 The only thing undecided is whether you will give it to me or if I must take it. 
 We've created a world here. 
 There are families now, children, a whole generation. 
 And if I succeed... they will never have been born. 
 I, too, wish that the plague had never happened. 
 The great minds lost... your daughter, my wife. 
 But equally, I mourn the loss of who you might've been. 
 I would so have loved to have seen her, instead of this. 
 And very soon... you will. 
 man : I'm gonna keep asking. 
 How'd you find this place? 
 How many more of you Scavs know about this place, huh? 
 I could do this all day. 
 Can you? 
 Had enough? 
 [groans] 
 Hey. 
 Ramse : Cole! 
 [grunts] Cole! 
 I'm right here, man! 
 Hey! Listen to me! 
 Listen to me! 
 Okay? Remember Donovan! 
 Who the hell's Donovan? 
 [chuckles] 
 Who's Donovan? 
 [laughs] 
 Donovan. [chuckles] 
 He was a buddy of ours. 
 He wasn't a buddy. 
 He was just a guy we ran with. The guy was an asshole. 
 He got caught by militia. 
 They interrogated him. 
 They tried to. [laughs] 
 Ramse : He was so scared... 
 He sh1t his pants. [laughs] 
 And they let him go. 
 You don't want to be Donovan, Cole! 
 [laughing] 
 Ramse : Cole. 
 Jones : Stop. 
 You. 
 Your name is Cole? 
 I've been waiting for you. 
 [people shouting] 
 woman : Where's the cure? 
 Give us the cure! Why are you hiding it? 
 You cowards! Help us, God damn it! 
 Come on. 
 
 
 
 Jennifer : Look. 
 Look before you. 
 Listen! Listen! Listen. 
 The thunder of fallen men! 
 Great men, our fathers, forfeiting their world, their legacy, but not for their sons... for their wives, for their mothers, for their daughters! 
 Disappearing men die on their sword. 
 We daughters shall make from 12 what men could not. 
 Yes... 
 An army! 
 You... 
 You see it. 
 12's not primary. 
 No, but 13. 
 You're a bright little monkey. [screams] 
 [laughing] Yes! 
 I like you. 
 Cassie. 
 Welcome back. 
 Do you remember the first year underground? 
 No windows, no sunshine. 
 I lost all sense of time. 
 I felt as... as though I was choking. 
 It was a coffin. 
 Yes, exactly. 
 And we would sneak upstairs and look at the stars. 
 Cassiopeia. Andromeda. 
 Whole constellations, untouched by disease, oblivious to our suffering. 
 And I told Hannah, no matter what will happen to us... the stars will remain. 
 And I promised her... 
 "Yet, do thy worst, old Time, despite thy wrong." 
 "My love shall in my verse ever live young." 
 Shakespeare. 
 You see, Kat, it's not gone. 
 It doesn't die. 
 Those days we spent trapped underground surrounded by all those books, human beings, gone. 
 But their voices were still with us, thriving. 
 We had hope. 
 They were better times. 
 Yes, they were. 
 You and I were better too. 
 We were. 
 You were the most brilliant woman I had ever known. 
 But I was also something else. 
 Yes? 
 And what's that? 
 A mother. 
 [grunting] 
 [gasps] 
 Ka... 
 Oh! [grunting] 
 Good-bye, Jonathan... for now. 
 You two, by the gates. 
 Eyes open, boys. 
 [silenced gunshots] 
 [whistles] 
 [engine turning over] 
 [grunts] Still got it. 
 Okay. Got it. 
 [gunshot] 
 Ramse : Down. Down! 
 You okay? You're okay. 
 Cassie, on recording : The plague starts with Leland Frost. 
 The true architects of the plague... 
 They're watching me. 
 I'm running out of time here. 
 ...is among you. Please, Cole. 
 [recording cuts off] 
 So what? 
 So what? 
 So what, some chick said my name. 
 There's a million Coles. 
 How do you know she's talking about me? 
 I know. 
 How? 
 Just know I do... as I knew that someday I would find you. 
 This mission is preordained, Mr. Cole. 
 Fraulein,  he ain't interested. 
 Does your friend speak for you? 
 Look, not that this mission doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but I'm just not sure I'm the right guy for the job. 
 You know, as a matter of fact, my buddy Ramse here has a hole opening up in his schedule. 
 Oh, no, it's all you, brother. 
 He might be able to help you out. 
 Fate has chosen you, Mr. Cole. 
 Let me show you. 
 Let her show you. 
 What the hell is that thing? 
 That is our salvation. 
 The virus is not yet done with us, Mr. Cole. 
 It will mutate again and again until not even the immune are left standing. 
 There's only one way to end it. 
 And you are the key. 
 I want to send you back to stop the plague before it ever happens. 
 That's impossible. 
 Nothing is impossible. 
 [gunfire] 
 Jones : Difficult, yes. 
 Dangerous. 
 Not impossible. 
 But there will be a price. 
 If we are to reset time, all this before you will vanish. 
 This world will cease to exist. 
 This dark time must be sacrificed to restore a brighter one. 
 We have no other choice. 
 And if all this disappears... so, too, shall we. 
 And you and I... we will start anew. 
 All humanity depends on us. 
 But they will never know what we have done. 
 I'm grateful for that. 
 So tell me, Mr. Cole... will you help me? 
 Go to hell. 
 [distant siren wailing] 
 What the hell happened? 
 The virus... how'd the 12 Monkeys get it? 
 I thought we stopped them in Chechnya. 
 Chechnya? 
 That feels like a million years ago. 
 After the bombing, I splintered back to 2017 by accident. 
 I know. I remember. 
 I thought it was over... and that you were erased. 
 The machine never pulled me back. 
 Something must be wrong. 
 Oh... 
 Here we are. 
 And it's just like you said it would be. 
 All those years you and I fought, and we couldn't stop it. 
 [swallows hard] 
 You always said a cure was impossible. 
 I had to try. 
 I know. 
 [coughing] 
 You all right? 
 [wheezing] 
 The soldier you sent, how did you know where I was? 
 You told me. 
 You don't remember because you haven't done it yet. 
 I see you again? 
 Yes. 
 It's been two years since we bombed the compound. 
 A lot has happened since then... with you and me. 
 Tell me. I need to know everything. 
 How did they get the virus, the witness... 
 Cass? 
 Oh, hey! 
 Cassie! 
 Cass? 
 Hey! Hey, I need a doctor in here! 
 Help! 
 Dr. Adler... start preparations. 
 We have the core. 
 [whirring] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Jones : Careful. 
 [thud, whirring stops] 
 Marcus. 
 Your father... his sacrifice was not for nothing. 
 Promise me this'll work. 
 It will. 
 Now it has to. 
 I always thought, whoever found the cure, it would have to be Foster. 
 No one was more driven. 
 If he couldn't, perhaps no one can. 
 Now all that remains is our work. 
 We must press on. 
 Ramse : This place isn't much, but it's safe. 
 Me and Cole used to stay here back in the day. 
 Hey. 
 You're okay... safe. 
 They were my family. 
 How could she do this? 
 Jones... she's trying to save the world. 
 She doesn't have to. 
 Foster already did. 
 Foster cured the first mutation. 
 That's it. 
 That's not what happened. 
 Jose, I was there. I saw it. 
 Why won't you believe me? 
 He was obsessed. 
 He would do anything... 
 What about Jones? 
 What would she do for her mission? 
 Anything. 
 Have you considered that maybe... she lied... to all of you? 
 Maybe she's only out for herself. 
 [indistinct chatter, tools clanking] 
 [clang, device whirring] 
 [excited chatter] 
 Cassie. 
 Cass! 
 Cassie, wake up. 
 Come on. 
 Cassie, hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, there you are. Huh? 
 It's you. 
 Yeah. 
 James. 
 [chuckles] 
 The Red Forest, did you find it? 
 I don't... 
 Oh, no, no, you don't... you don't know yet. 
 [gasping] 
 Tell me. Tell me, please. 
 I want to. 
 I want to tell you everything. 
 But I can't change the path you're on. 
 [wheezing] 
 Hey, hey. 
 Take this. 
 Keep it to yourself... and with you at all times. 
 What is it? 
 An address. 
 It's why I brought you here. 
 Your life depends on it. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 James? 
 I don't want to be alone when I... 
 You're not. You're not alone. 
 You're not alone. I'm right here with you. 
 James. 
 Yeah? 
 You're gonna find the answers you're looking for. 
 Keep going. 
 I don't know if I can. 
 You can. 
 You will. 
 No matter what I do, you always die. 
 See you soon. 
 [gasps] 
 Cassie? 
 [switch clicks] 
 [pounding switchboard] 
 [click, device whirring] 
 [groans] 
 James. 
 I thought you were gone forever. 
 I watched it happen all over again... 
 2017... the plague. 
 I lost her. 
 Ramse : Cole, what are you doing? 
 Pack your bags, man. We're leaving. 
 Here. 
 What if she's telling the truth? 
 Are you kidding? That's crazy, man. 
 What if she's not? 
 Come on, let's get out of here. 
 We got no gear. Winter's coming. 
 Just sack up. We'll be fine. 
 Listen, West 7's not going to find us. 
 We're safe. We have food. 
 Cole : Jackpot. 
 Hey... 
 What are you doing? 
 Me and you... 
 We've done things, okay? 
 I made my peace with it. 
 Have you? 
 Ramse, don't... 
 Florida is not going to fix this. 
 It's not. 
 What are you doing, man? 
 Hear me out. I know she's got a screw loose. 
 She's a nut job. 
 But what if she's telling the truth? 
 What if it works? 
 You got to take that shot. 
 You need this. 
 You're insane. 
 I'm leaving with or without you. 
 [gunshot] 
 What are you doing? 
 Stop! Put down your weapon. 
 Saving your soul, brother. 
 Saving your soul. 
 Ramse : Hell of lot's happened since you've been gone, brother. 
 I know. 
 I heard everything. 
 Then you know what she did, right? 
 She did what she had to. 
 She murdered half of Spearhead. 
 They had a cure. 
 She lied to us, man. 
 You with her on this? 
 The mission's all that matters now. 
 Where you going? 
 Where do you think I'm going? 
 I won't let you hurt her. 
 You won't let me? 
 What are you gonna do? 
 What are you gonna do, Cole? 
 I found Elena. 
 She was living there... 
 Spearhead. 
 She's got a kid... my kid. 
 Jesus, man, I'm sorry. 
 Oh, you're... you're sorry? 
 That's nice. 
 This ain't working. 
 It's not working. 
 You got to stop. 
 I can't. 
 I won't. 
 I watched the world die, Ramse... everyone. 
 I watched her die. 
 It's meant to happen, brother. 
 She's always gonna die. 
 Hey, don't... 
 Don't say that. 
 Don't say that. 
 You think you're saving people? 
 Hmm? 
 You do, don't you? 
 You're not erasing anyone. 
 This has got to stop. I mean... we're done. 
 You don't get to make that call. 
 Oh? 
 West 7 all over again, huh? 
 You're willing to do anything? 
 I'm not going to let her die, Ramse. 
 There he is. That's the Cole I know. 
 You're blind, and you're selfish. 
 What about me? 
 What about you, Ramse? 
 What about you? 
 My son. 
 Your son's already dead. 
 There is no future. 
 Get it through your head.
