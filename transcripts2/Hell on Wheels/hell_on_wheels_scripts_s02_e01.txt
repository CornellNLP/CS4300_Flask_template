 [Train whistle blows] 
 Brake! Brake! 
 Man: What's going on? 
 Keep your yankee hands where we can see 'em [fires] and no one will get shot! 
 [Shouting] 
 We want your valuables. 
 Give me your money, let's go. 
 Let's go. Empty those pockets. Let's go. 
 Come on there. Don't you hold out on me, now. 
 [Shouting] 
 Take this. 
 Damn it, give me that gun! 
 Damn-- give me that! 
 What have you got? Get back there! 
 Blow the lock! 
 All right. 
 Don't shoot me. 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 Whoo! 
 What you think about that, huh? 
 Bring that sack in here! 
 Let's get moving. 
 Come on! 
 You'll be all right! Let's go! 
 Can you ride? 
 Yeah. 
 You on? Yeah. 
 All right, go, go, let's go. 
 Come on, Mississippi! 
 Come on! 
 Come on, boys! 
 [Shouting and whooping] 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 One more man on the front line. Let's go! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 [Woman screams] 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 [Whistle blows] 
 Hey! 
 [Shouting] 
 Why don't you kill the b*st*rd? 
 All right, get back to work! 
 Go to hell, Schmidt! 
 Get back to work, you bastards! 
 [Shouting] 
 Ain't you gonna do something? 
 Not my job. 
 [Shouting] 
 [Groaning] 
 What exactly is your job? 
 You'll see. 
 [Thunder] 
 Graders are averaging less than 2,000 feet per day. 
 And last week only 1,200 rails were spiked. 
 1,800 ties laid. 
 [Sighs] It's simply not acceptable. 
 Have you talked to Mr. Schmidt about all this? 
 Yes. He tipped his hat at me and looked coy. 
 I considered wiping the grin off his face with the back of my hand. 
 But I thought better of it. 
 Good. 
 [Sighs] 
 Lily, you must remember we males have very fragile egos. 
 Especially when it comes to dealing with a strong woman. 
 [Sighs] Hmm. You poor things. 
 Mm. 
 Well, today is payday. 
 Tomorrow will be better. 
 Wouldn't hold my breath, Mr. Durant. 
 Payroll train's been robbed again. 
 Damn it! 
 Thom, now is the time. Send word to Fort Kearny. 
 We need protection. 
 We can't. If our enemies in Washington knew we can't protect our own payroll... 
 Mr. Ferguson. 
 It seems we'll be needing your services again. 
 Happy to oblige, sir. 
 What in the hell is that? 
 This here? 
 200s worth of Yankee bank notes. 
 That's your cut, Bohannon. 
 I thought the idea was... 
 We save our take for the colony for Mexico. 
 General Shelby and Magruder's already down there. 
 We're going to Mexico, I assure you. 
 I told you, these boys, they don't get it. 
 We're gonna need this money for... 
 Buying land, putting in crops, cattle, I don't know. 
 Look, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right. 
 I call the shots here, not you. 
 I'm just asking for... 
 A little contribution. 
 Then you can keep calling the shots. How about that? 
 [Groans] 
 You worry too much, Bohannon. 
 Heh heh heh heh. 
 Man: More coffee? We won last night. 
 We deserve a chance to whoop it up a little, right, boys? 
 Man: That's right! 
 Viva LA Mexico. Viva LA Mexico. 
 Viva LA Mexico. 
 Here you go, doc. 
 Put that in the kitty. 
 Another contribution, Cullen? 
 Yeah. 
 How's Tommy doing? 
 He's dead. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's take a look at that shoulder. 
 Come on. 
 I seem to remember pulling buckshot out of your rear end once before. 
 I must have patched you up more than any other kid in meridian. 
 [Groans] 
 Seems like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? 
 Well, it was. 
 Hey, you know, Cullen, I had mixed feelings about you joining up with us when we ran into you down in meridian. 
 Doc... 
 You don't need to worry about me, all right? 
 I knew what I was getting into. 
 [Sniffles] 
Hey. 
 To a new start down in old Mexico. 
 Amen to that. 
 And all them pretty senoritas. 
 I'd like to talk to you about the love of Christ. 
 Brothers and sisters... 
 [Man shouting] 
 Be firm. 
 Be watchful. 
 Stand firm in your faith. 
 Act like men. 
 Be strong. 
 As Jesus turned, and seeing her, he said, "Take heart, daughter, our faith has made you well." 
 And the woman was made well. 
 Buy some property in the fastest-growing town in the territory. 
 Right, chief. 
 Start a business. 
 Build a homestead. 
 The finest tent... 
 Right here, sir. 
 Consider yourself the proud owner of a prime piece of railroad real estate. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 Step right up! 
 Fine property, waiting to be had. 
 Lots for sale! Lots for sale! 
 What? Mick. 
 Shouldn't you be getting on with that other business of yours? 
 What other business? 
 I don't much care, brother, as long as you get on with it. 
 Right. 
 Miss Ruth. 
 What can I do for you today? 
 It's about the rent, I'm afraid. 
 Late again? 
 It's father. He's not well. 
 And if he's not well, he can't preach. 
 And if he can't preach, there's no collection money coming in. 
 I'm sympathetic to your plight, miss Ruth, but, uh, there's only so much I can do. 
 I'm but a humble employee of the railroad. 
 I'm afraid I don't know what to do. 
 Maybe we could discuss this at dinner. 
 With my father there, of course. 
 I was thinking maybe just the two of us. 
 Mr. McGinnes, what sort of girl do you think I am? 
 I'll do my best to have you the rent soon. 
 You have my word. 
 Yes. 
 Mr. Gundersen. 
 Ah. Mit Herredomme... 
 What happened to him? 
 Ah, stabbed in the eye it would appear. 
 Another victim of the chaos that presides here. 
 Bandits rob your trains, murderers run your streets, work has slowed to a-- to a crawl. 
 You needn't remind me of my own business, Gundersen. 
 Sir, I have worked for you since before New York. 
 I've always been faithful and diligent, hmm? 
 Let me help you. 
 I appreciate it. 
 But since those Irish boys tarred and feathered you and ran you out of town on a rail... 
 Embrace this new job, Gundersen. 
 Lowly and noisome though it may be, you provide an invaluable service to the community. 
 Community. 
 [Thunder] 
 Community. 
 ♪ Hurrah, hurrah 
 ♪ for southern rights, hurrah 
 ♪ hurrah for the Bonnie blue flag ♪ 
♪ that bears a single star 
 [laughing] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Think they would have learned their damn lesson. 
 Especially after general Sherman had that little barbecue of his. 
 Just ignore 'em, Cullen. 
 I can't. 
 How you boys don'? 
 Ohh! 
 Aah! 
 [Grunting] 
 Come here, boy. 
 You gonna feel that tomorrow. 
 Them Yankee farm boys are gonna feel it a whole lot worse. 
 Ahh. 
 Your father had a penchant for spirits and a good fight. 
 Like father like son, huh? 
 I said a good fight. 
 Tell me, Cullen, what did you gain in there? 
 You teach those Yankee boys a lesson, did you? 
 Something like that, yeah. 
 It's you who needs the lesson. 
 You are better than them damn fools in there. 
 If they's fools, what you don' ridin' with 'em? 
 Well, sad as it is, right now, those boys are the closest thing to family I got. 
 They dug up my family, doc. 
 Carpetbaggers, they tore up plenty of graves in our hometowns looking for loot. 
 They dug up my boy. 
 My Mary. 
 What kind of man does that? 
 [Ticking] 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 [Whistle blows] 
 [Children playing] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Elam? 
 In the flesh. 
 Why are you here? 
 Just passing through. 
 You still working for Mr. Durant? 
 I'm on the job right now. 
 I guess you got what you wanted, then. 
 Hello, Mr. Ferguson. 
 It's a surprise to see you again, sir. 
 What brings you to our fair town? 
 He's on railroad business for Mr. Durant. 
 Ah. I, too, work for Mr. Durant. 
 He appointed me station agent here. 
 Congratulations. 
 To both of you. 
 Would you like to join us for supper? 
 Well, maybe some other time, then. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe some other time. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 Wake up! 
 Get up! 
 Supply train leavin' in 5 minutes! 
 Ain't all of you ain't got a job. 
 Get up, you bastards! 
 [Woman screaming] 
 Penny is dead! 
 Ginny? What is it? 
 Get back to work. There's men waitin'. 
 [Murmuring] 
 Ohh... 
 Such a terrible thing. 
 Truly it is, brother. 
 Tragic. 
 But this could be the opportunity we've been looking for. 
 You ain't gonna believe this, boys. 
 There's a nigger guard in the payroll car. 
 Let me take point, captain. Shoot that buck dead. 
 Let me see him. 
 I've been the first man through the door all along. 
 I think I've earned the right to take him down. 
 All right, Bohannon, you got it. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Patrons chattering] 
 No, don't. 
 I don't know why they bother me with these things. 
 Thomas, what is it? 
 [Sighs] It seems a woman has been murdered. 
 A first for our little community. 
 She was just a whore, but still... 
 Do they know who killed her? 
 Certainly one of our employees. 
 Lily, you don't have to concern yourself with this. 
 Thomas, this man needs to be found. 
 He will be punished. 
 I'm afraid nobody's going to care very much about the killing of a prostitute. 
 Thomas, you hang horse thieves here. 
 Are you saying horses are more valuable than these women? 
 Sad to say, but yes. Yes, they are. 
 You don't mean that. 
 Lily, she chose a dangerous profession. 
 With choices come consequences. 
 Let's eat our breakfast, shall we? 
 
 
 
 Now! 
 Hyah! 
 [Shouting] 
 [Hoofbeats] 
 Hyah! 
 Hyah! 
[Gasping] 
 All right, this here's a stickup! 
 All right, everybody, wallet, watch, jewelry, put it in the bag right now. 
 Come on, now. Don't be foolish. 
 Open up! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Open the damn door! 
 Bohannon? 
 Damn right. Open up. 
 [Overlapping shouting] 
 Son, you want to sit down? 
 What the hell you don' here? 
 Trying to keep you from getting yourself killed. 
 Get that gun out of my face and give me the payroll. 
 You hand that money over I can't. 
 Or I'll kill you my damn self. 
 Go on, then. 
 Pull the trigger. 
 [Pounding on door] 
What the hell's going on in there? 
 You stupid son of a... 
 [Shouting] 
 Aim high. 
 Keep shooting. 
[Woman screams] 
 Right now! Put it in the bag. 
 He's got the drop on me! 
 Come on! We gotta get off this train! 
 Come on. 
 Uhh! 
 Let's get outta here! 
 Come on, boys. Let's ride! 
 Hyah! Hyah! 
 [Knock on door] 
 Come in. 
 Eh...Tor Gundersen, ma'am. 
 Here to empty your Jerry pot. 
 Thank you, Mr. Gundersen. 
 Not necessary, ma'am. 
 It's my job. We all must do our jobs, huh? 
 Yes, but... I imagine it's hard with... 
 Considering-- how far I've fallen. 
 Look h...how far you rose up. 
 Hmm? Mm. 
 Aye. 
 We all do what we must to carry on. 
 Hmm. 
 Mr. Gundersen. The woman, um... 
 The one they killed... 
 The whore? 
 What--what will happen to her? 
 She'll have a whore's grave. 
 See that she gets a proper burial. 
 Ah... 
 The reverend and I will-- will bury her 6 feet down, eh? 
 Like a proper lady. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm. 
 Have a good day. 
 Good morning, father. 
 I'm preparing-- 
 [clears throat] 
 For Sunday's sermon. 
 Matthew 7:13. 
 You sure you're up to it? 
 I am, Ruth. 
 Then I suppose you won't be wanting this today. 
 I know what you're doing. 
 And what is that? 
 You--heh heh-- you don't believe in me anymore. 
 Of course I do. 
 [Grunts] 
 Then we--we don't need-- we don't need this. 
 Praise Jesus. 
 It's wonderful. 
 I'll pour it out, then. 
 Y-you can't. 
 I--I'll have one last drink. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Ahh... 
 [Sighs] 
 Let's go to Mexico, boys. 
 Right now. Whoa. 
 Slow down there, son. 
 We'll take a paddle steamer to Louisiana. 
 Texas-New Orleans railroad from there to Galveston. 
 Hell, it ain't but a 300-mile ride to Mexico from there. 
 That's a good idea. 
 Right after we take down another train. 
 We got enough money. 
 Besides, they're expecting us. 
 The guard on that last train was waiting for us. 
 You scared, Bohannon? 
 Is that it? 
 You're treading on some skinny ice, son. 
 You want to do this, Mississippi? 
 Why didn't you draw down on that darkie? 
 Just the way it played out, I guess. 
 All right. 
 One more train. 
 Then we go to Mexico. 
 Cullen Bohannon is robbing my trains and you didn't kill him? 
 You hired me to protect your payroll and that's what I done. 
 Yes, you did at that. 
 Maybe I could do more for you, Mr. Durant. 
 More? 
 This town's goin' to hell in a handbasket. 
 Your point is? 
 I'm the man that could fix things. 
 I have no doubt you are up to the job, Mr. Ferguson. 
 But it's not as simple as all that. 
 Maybe if I was a few shades lighter? 
 I won't lie to you--yes. 
 I can do it. 
 All I need is a chance. 
 Let me think about it. 
 Appreciate that. 
 Bohannon. 
 I should have known. 
 Another brick on his road to hell. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 The man did this would be dead already if the Swede was still running things. 
 I miss him. 
 The Swede put a thumpin' on you, Nell. 
 Hell, that was just business. 
 You think I don't beat on my girls when they hold out on me? 
 That man ran this shithole of a town like a fine watch. 
 Well, it's your lucky day, Nell. 
 'Cause that's why me and Mickey are here. 
 How the hell are you two skinny chaps gonna protect my knocking shop? 
 Give us a chance. 
 What have you got to lose? 
 We're in, boyo. 
 Same deal as the Swede-- 
10% of the take, after expenses. 
 That's great. 
 There's one small catch. 
 You have to kill that man that did her dollymop. 
 What? 
 I ain't no killer. 
 Mick, that's what you said in Boston. 
 But that was different. 
 Things...got out of hand. 
 I ain't a killer. 
 Cullen, you need to get on this horse and ride away from here as fast as you can. 
 Them Alabama boys are none too happy with you right about now. 
 Doc... 
 If you'll excuse me, I got a train to rob. 
 Cullen, this ain't gonna end well. 
 It rarely does.

 Ma'am, I need you to put that purse in this bag. 
 Take the ring off your finger! 
 Hurry up! 
 I'm gonna put a hole in your boy's head if you don't give me that ring. 
 Hurry up! 
 Hurry up! Try harder! 
 You want a dead child in your lap? 
 I will kill this Yankee spawn. 
 Take that ring off your finger! 
 Get that ring off your finger! 
 Do you want this boy to die?! 
 You better stand down, son. 
 Last chance. 
 No. It's yours. 
 [Cocks pistol] 
 Hey. 
 sh1t. 
 Lily: They're watching us. 
 I can feel it. 
 After what happened to you and Robert, I can understand your unease. 
 We surveyed this area. 
 The Sioux believe the land across that river is sacred... 
 Where the earth touches heaven. 
 Robert wanted to avoid it. 
 What do you think? 
 My husband was rarely wrong on these matters. 
 I know they're over there waiting for us. 
 We can't ignore them. 
 But they will be the least of our troubles if we don't get this railroad under control. 
 [Humming] 
 Unless you got a bee in your throat, best cease that hum sound. 
 A happy man's got a right to hum, all right? 
 Son, you're getting set to be hanged. 
 Nah, they won't hang me. 
 Shoot me, most likely.

 Well, it was a whore who... 
 Bathed the feet of Jesus with--with her hair. 
 Yeah. Amen. 
 Huh? 
 Yah. 
 Uh... 
 Father, accept this whore into the ground so that her corruption may be completed. 
 May her soul be eternally forgotten. 
 May we be cleansed of her memory. 
 We ask... these things in your name. Humbly. 
 Amen.

 Amen.

 Many new graves.
