 Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels... 
 Guilty of armed robbery and sedition. 
 This town's goin' to hell in a handbasket. 
 It'll be difficult to do the right thing. 
 Because she was a whore? 
 Another victim of the chaos. 
 You two gotta protect my shop. 
 What have you got to lose? 
 This is a pardon. 
 Don't judge or you too will be judged! 
 I want him punished. 
 I can't oblige you on that, ma'am. 
 Fine, I'll tell Eva what you said. 
 You have your work cut out for you, Bohannon. 
 Get this railroad under control. 
 [Birds singing] 
 [Grunting] 
 The Swede: In the beginning, there was blood. 
 The land demands it. 
 Every new land demands blood, and we relent. 
 It is our nature. 
 [Pig squealing] 
 We are, after all, animals. 
 In our arrogance, we forget this, but... In the end, we rise from the land, only to return. 
 You're very skilled with a blade. 
 Mr. Bauer. 
 Very efficient. 
 There's no pride in wastefulness, herr Swede. 
 Only sin. We must use all. 
 Even this. 
 [Fly buzzing] 
 Mm. Jah. Hmm! 
 A good butcher does not waste lives. 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 It's a shame, what happened to your friend, dieter schmidt. 
 We work hard. 
 And his life is taken for no reason, just some filthy whore. 
 Yeah, I agree. 
 A useless end. 
 A needless, sinful squandering of a productive life. 
 Yeah. 
 The Swede: Nothing wasted in this wasteland. 
 Nothing. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Horse nickers] 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 [Indistinct chatter and yelling] 
 [Sighs] 
 Our foreman's been killed. 
 I saw him out in front of the whorehouse. He didn't look too good. 
 Ahem. You'll have to ride out to rail's end. 
 The men are waiting for orders. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Mr. Bohannon, you may have heard that-- 
 You're working for durant now? 
 For the railroad, yes. 
 He's been very kind to me. 
 Actually respects my opinion. 
 Sounds good. 
 Yes, well... 
 You know how people talk-- 
 To hell with people. 
 I'm glad for you, Lily. 
 Thank you. 
 Good day, Mr. Bohannon. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Gasping] 
 You told me you weren't much of a drinking man. 
 Seems to me like you've taken to the bottle like a babe to the breast. 
 What is it? 
 A woman? 
 I thought so. 
 Ahh. 
 I have another assignment for you, Mr. ferguson. 
 I would like you to keep an eye on Mr. Bohannon. 
 This about a woman, Mr. durant? 
 I took a risk bringing him here, and I just want to make sure that risk does not backfire on me. 
 Now, can you put your friendship with him aside and do that for me? 
 Yes, sir. I can do this job. 
 Good. 
 I could have did his job, too. 
 [Both grunting and moaning] 
 Sweet Jesus. 
 [Laughs] 
 Mmm. Mmm. Ooh. 
 Are you all right? 
 Bloody gobsmacked... 
[Laughs] 
 Is what I am. 
 You're a miracle, you are although me langer is chafed something fierce. 
 Ohh! [Scoffs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, where are you off to? 
 I've got customers waiting. 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm scared, Mickey. 
 That business with penny has all the girls spooked. 
 Come here to me. 
 [Sighs] 
 You and the other girls needn't worry no more. 
 Sean and me are running protection on this place now. 
 Any one of them brutes so much as lays a finger on you, you come to ol' Mick, and he'll get done like schmidt. 
 Mick... 
 You done schmidt? 
 Um... 
 What did you think? 
 [Whistle blows] 
 [Indistinct chatter and yelling] 
 What'd you spend it on? 
 We got a problem here, psalms? 
 Working under the man that stole our money. 
 Bet your ass I got a problem. 
 The payroll was insured by the United States government. 
 You got your money. Late. 
 I got it late. 
 When you're living payroll to payroll, that mean you go hungry. 
 [Indistinct murmuring] 
 Look here... 
 It wasn't personal, all right? 
 You stole my money. 
 I take that sh1t personal. 
 This man's right. 
 I stoled y'all's payroll. 
 [All murmuring] 
 And Mr. durant saved my hide from hanging so I could ride out here and whip your sorry asses into shape. 
 It ain't fair, but there it is. 
 [Horse neighing] 
 Anybody else got a problem with that? 
 Mr. Toole? You got a problem with me? 
 I haven't, sure. 
 Wasn't my payroll you took. 
 Gentlemen, meet your new foreman. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Did you do it? 
 Do what? 
 Elam ferguson, you tell me plain. 
 You the fool gutted that whore-killer? 
 Who you calling "fool"? 
 Oh, damn. 
 You did do it. 
 [Exhales] 
 No one's ever... 
 Gutted a man for me before. 
 I ain't never said I did such a thing. 
 Well, it sure as hell wasn't Mr. Toole that did it. 
 You sure about that? 
 He tried to hang a man once. I remember. 
 Mr. Toole's my husband, and I got no complaints. 
 He's put food in my belly and a roof over my head ever since we hopped the twig. 
 And he never raised a hand to me but twice, and both times, he had liquor on him, and he done it all with charitable words and a lovesick smile. 
 Charitable words while he beating on you? 
 Truth be told, I probably deserved it. 
 He better hope I never see him raise a hand to you. 
 You are a fool. 
 You're a fool that would rather have a... 
 Pocket full of gold eagles than a strong backed, sweet-mouthed woman willing to... 
 Wash your drawers and warm your bed, and all for nothing but a kiss... 
 And a promise. 
 Stop that. 
 I'm married! 
 I just came to thank you for what you did. 
 [Train whistle] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Sniffs] 
 Whoa. 
 Another wretched soul for you to commend to heaven, Reverend. 
 Ahh. 
 I don't remember seeing you at the pulpit of late. 
 Come to think of it, I... 
 Can't recall you preaching at all since we arrived here at our new home. 
 Yeah, well, I have nothing to say. 
 No one wants to hear. 
 You know, they've taken away my church. 
 A den of thieves. 
 They've also taken my caboose. 
 You know, my very own daughter took it from me. 
 And I believe she's-- 
 She's trying to corrupt my son. 
 Shame. 
 Our lord rode into Jerusalem on the back of an ass. 
 And one of the first thing he done when got there was cleanse the temple. 
 Herd the money lenders out on their avaricious rumps. 
 It's time we overturn the tables, Reverend. 
 We must cast them out. 
 Durant: If we can cross this, we have a clear path to the Colorado territory. 
 If we fail, or if we're delayed, I lose my race with the central pacific and this railroad is a failure. 
 Men don't want me here. 
 They won't work hard. 
 Then make them! It ain't that easy. 
 I bought your life back. 
 And you made a bad purchase. 
 That's my business. 
 Yours is to get me to the rockies. 
 Sooner you do that, sooner you'll be free. 
 We are not here to cast stones or talk about the circumstances of Mr. Schmidt's death. 
 The time for judgment is not now. 
 This is a time to reflect. 
 Look around. 
 This is the world that Mr. schmidt built. 
 You. 
 These friendships. 
 Just as all of you have joined him in the building of this railroad. 
 After all... 
 Was Jesus not a carpenter? 
 A builder? 
 For this, we are all blessed. 
 Reverend Cole: Fornicator! 
 [All murmuring] 
 Reverend, please. 
 Now this is not a time to cast judgment or speak about the sins of the dead-- 
 I'm not speaking about the dead. 
 I'm speaking about you. 
 She has lain with a man from the camp, and the blood of her sin has stained our altar! 
 How dare you come in here! 
 You won't take my church. Your church?! 
 You gave this church up for a bottle of whisky. 
 Fornicator! Reverend! 
 [All murmuring] 
 Reverend! 
 Show respect! This is a funeral! 
 Out, out! Gentlemen! 
 This man of God is not your enemy. 
 Everyone is upset. We have all lost a brother. 
 You, uh... 
 Poor Mr. schmidt. 
 You tr-- you traveled from Germany together. 
 Eh? Is it not true? 
 Jah. 
 How did your friend brave those seas to be gutted and displayed in the street, like a pig in your butcher shop? 
 He was a good man. 
 Yeah, he was. 
 And he was murdered by whoremongers. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Now we all know the truth. 
 Your anger is not at Reverend Cole. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 It is at a world where your friend is dead and, uh, Irish brothers who butchered him are allowed to walk free and... Boast of their crime. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Where's McGinnes? 
 Mr. McGinnes! Mr. McGinnes! 
 Mr. McGinnes! 
 What is it? They've got him! 
 Mr. McGinnes. 
 These men would like a word with you. 
 [Indistinct yelling] 
 What-- what are you doing? No, no! 
 Good day. 
 No! 
 Bohannon: So, what's your opinion on that gorge, Ms. Bell? 
 She thinks we should avoid it. 
 Thomas, please. 
 I believe it to be too dangerous. 
 We've never built a bridge of that size and scope before. 
 And the sioux will harass us every step of the way. 
 And that's where I come in, I suppose, huh? 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 Thought you should know that you got a mob of Germans out there dragging them McGinnes boys into the slaughterhouse. 
 I'll take the front, you take the back. 
 Ain't none of my business. 
 That's your job. 
 This... 
 Is railroad business, Mr. ferguson. 
 Get this boy, will you? 
 [Indistinct yelling] 
 [Groaning] 
 I didn't do anything, please, please. 
 [Groaning] 
 Please tell me what's going on. 
 Please, please! 
 Get up! 
 [Groaning] 
 We didn't do anything! 
 [All groaning] 
 [Indistinct yelling and groaning] 
 Now not to worry. I don't know what this is about. 
 If you want money, we've got money. 
 Money is no object to us, all right? 
 So just talk to us. 
 I'll kill you! 
 Where the hell you think you're going? 
 I'm taking the front. 
 [Groaning] 
 [Punching] 
 [Gagging] 
 Mess them up. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 I know what you want! 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Shut them up. 
 [Indistinct yelling] 
 You don't have to shut-- 
 [Muffled yelling and shrieking] 
 You need to let them boys down. 
 
 
 
 Don't look at him. 
 He ain't the one talking. 
 This is not your business, Schwartze. 
 They killed our friend. 
 Your friend killed a woman. 
 You should not listen to the talk of whores. 
 Step back. 
 Real easy. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I've been gone that long? 
 Mr. ferguson, tell them who I am. 
 Tell 'em yourself. 
 I answer directly to Thomas durant. 
 We both do. 
 There's only two of you. 
 [Groaning] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 No, no. 
 We didn't do it, Mr. Bohannon! 
 You know me! 
 Did you take credit for it? 
 Well, yeah. But I was just running me mouth. 
 You run your mouth, you take the consequences. 
 They all think you did it. 
 So congratulations, dumbass. Get in there. 
 [Indistinct muttering] 
 I told your black friend. 
 I will tell you. 
 Either you kill these men or I will. 
 You hear that, Irish?! 
 Either way, you're going to die. 
 All right, the whole damn town heard you. 
 You proved you're a man. 
 Get your ass on out of here before I show them otherwise. 
 [Train whistle] 
 Why the long face? 
 Your father's right. 
 We are fornicators. 
 Please, Joseph! 
 We preach against sin, but in God's eyes, we are sinners. 
 This injun bothering you, miss? 
 No. Thank you. 
 Ruth! 
 Ruth, I love you. 
 I want to marry you. 
 Joseph, think about what you're saying. 
 We will never be accepted as man and wife. 
 Then let's leave this place. 
 Our church is here, Joseph. 
 If I leave it with father, it will die. 
 You've got to get us out of here. 
 Sean. 
 I'll write ma a proper letter about your hanging. 
 I won't mention the whores. 
 My hanging? 
 Wake up, brother, they're hanging you, too. 
 I never laid a hand on him! Neither did I. 
 Then why did you go around blabbing to everyone that you had? 
 I-- I was with my girl! 
 Your girl. You mean the whore. 
 Watch your mouth. 
 She's a whore, Mickey. 
 By definition, she screws men for money. 
 And you want to impress her. 
 Ginny believed it, and then the other girls did, too, and-- I liked 'em believing it. 
 And you let me believe it, too, wouldn't you? 
 I wanted you to think that I could do something on me own for once. 
 Well, surely Mr. Bohannon wouldn't let us hang. 
 Will he? 
 Even if, somehow, we slipped the noose, that Kraut b*st*rd will butcher us soon enough. 
 Right? 
 You and me both know Mickey McgGinnes didn't de-bowel schmidt. 
 He was just flapping his gums to impress some girls. 
 Well, he confessed. 
 That's good enough for me. 
 What about his brother? 
 Well, they're obviously in it together. 
 So hang 'em both, huh? 
 [Sighs] Well... 
 Sean, uh, works for me. He can be valuable. 
 Perhaps we should spare him. 
 [Exhales] 
 But we cannot be seen to be weak on the killing of a foreman. 
 All right, then. 
 Sunrise, we string 'em up. 
 Perhaps we should investigate further. 
 What's to investigate? He's a confessed killer, end of story. He might be innocent. 
 You know... 
 I'm going to leave you two to debate that. 
 [Woman laughs] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 We have to stop Mr. Bohannon from hanging Mickey McGinnes. 
 We ain't got to do nothin' about it. 
 The man is innocent. 
 So what? 
 They hang, we scot free. 
 I'm going to tell Mr. Durant what we've done. 
 Hold on now. 
 You confess, you'll be watching me hang instead of him. 
 [Sighs] But you were operating under my orders. 
 Don't matter. Durant sure as hell ain't going to noose your neck. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'll keep your name out of it. 
 I know you will. 
 Welcome, brother. Thank you for joining us. 
 Our God's love for us is the reason he gave us his laws. 
 [Spits] 
 And our love of our God is the reason we obey his laws. 
 What's the law about an injun fornicating with a white woman? 
 This is a house of God! 
 [Laughs] 
 You done made it your own personal cathouse. 
 [All grunting] 
 Ahhh! 
 [All grunting] 
 Let the high praise of God be in their mouth and a two inches sword in their hand. 
 [Groaning and gasping] 
 You ok, son? 
 [Spits] 
 Thank you. 
 Miss Ruth. 
 It's only some fried pork and beans. 
 Well, at this moment, it's a feast fit for a king. 
 Mick. 
 Food. 
 Have you made peace with your maker, Sean? 
 Need a priest for that, Ruth. 
 To hear our sins. 
 All that really matters is that you have peace in your heart. 
 Don't you think? 
 I don't want to hear that right now. 
 All right. 
 I'll go. 
 No. 
 Stay with me. 
 Your face. 
 Your voice. 
 They bring me peace. 
 [Insects buzzing] 
 It was me. 
 I killed the foreman. 
 Yes, of course you did. 
 With your bare hands, hmm. 
 I paid a man $20 to kill him. 
 You're serious. 
 I didn't know he was your foreman. 
 But I wouldn't have acted differently had I known. 
 Thomas, he was a murderer. 
 Under whose authority did you take this action, Mrs. Bell? 
 It was justice. 
 So... You became judge, jury and executioner. 
 As you are doing with Mr. McGinnes. 
 After all I've done for you. 
 [Chuckles] You... 
 Usurped my authority, put my railroad at risk, killed one of my most valuable employees, and you dare to claim that it was justice! 
 It was justice! An innocent man is going to hang! 
 Someone has to hang! 
 Perhaps you would like to take their place in the interests of justice. 
 You lookin' for this? 
 She's an old piece. 
 But she still shoots true, huh? 
 Very flattering. 
 It was you agitating the Germans to hang the McGinnes boys. 
 Payback for the tar and feathers, I guess? 
 No, no, not true. 
 Any dispute between the celts and my nordic brethren, I must side with my brethren. 
 And like them, I-- 
 I despise the Irish. 
 See... 
 I got this idea. 
 You hate pretty much everybody. 
 Especially yourself. 
 Yes, that is where we are similar, Mr. Bohannon. 
 But I hate you more than you hate yourself. 
 You keep agitating trouble on this railroad... 
 You're going to a deep sleep at the bottom of your muck pile. 
 There won't be nobody to mourn or miss you, either. 
 You will miss me, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Yeah. 
 Will you so kind as to replace my weapon? 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 Fa! 
 You should leave this place. 
 Return to your people. 
 I don't have any people anymore. 
 Thanks to you. 
 I know. 
 I know it's-- 
It's all my fault. 
 But that's why you can't stay here. 
 You can't tell me what I can and can't do anymore. 
 I believed in you. 
 And everything you told me was a lie. 
 Jesus can't bring peace to these people! 
 And all they want to do is kill. 
 Kill my people, kill each other, ah, kill everything! 
 But that's-- that's why you can't stay here. 
 I love your daughter. 
 I'm not going to abandon her. 
 I'm not like you. 
 [Train whistle] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Train whistle] 
 [Glass breaks] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Pig squealing in distance] 
 [Rooster crowing] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Sighs] 
 Go ahead. 
 [Indistinct chatter and yelling] 
 Mr. Bohannon. 
 Mr. durant just decided to let the brothers go. 
 All by his self he decided that? 
 Yes. 
 Why did he send you to tell me, then? 
 He didn't. I volunteered. 
 Really? What's your stake in this? 
 I think they're innocent. 
 Think they're innocent? 
 [Train whistle] 
 Mr. Bohannon, go and set them free. 
 All right, then. 
 But hanging might have been merciful compared to what that Kraut butcher is going to do to them. 
 And you'll protect them, won't you? 
 It ain't my job to protect 'em. 
 I know what you did. 
 What's that? 
 [Sighs] 
 What was you and Mrs. Bell talking about in the saloon the other night? 
 What we did together. 
 Yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Keep a keen edge on that thing, huh? 
 Got to. 
 Yeah. 
 You come a long way since you used it on Johnson, didn't you? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Just be careful. 
 Next time a noose goes around your neck, it might not slip off so easy. 
 Thanks for the warning. 
 Guten tag, herr Bohannon. 
 I'm turning the McGinnes brothers loose. 
 Mr. Durant's order. 
 That is unfortunate. 
 But soon justice does have a knack of finding a way. 
 Like a pig to the trough, no? 
 You need to leave town. 
 What was that? 
 There's a train leaving in about an hour. You need to be on it. 
 [Chopping] 
 Or what? 
 [Grunts] 
 This is a free country, by God! 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 That was about the funniest damn thing I ever heard. 
 [Train whistle blowing in distance] 
 Was ist loss? 
 [Train passing] 
 [Grunting] 
 Gott im Himmel! 
 [Screaming] 
 [Groaning] 
 Sean! 
 Some help here, please! 
 [Screaming and groaning] 
 [Pigs squealing]
