 I'm so sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you renounce the spiritual forces of wickedness? 
 Reject the evil powers of this world, and repent of your sin? 
 I do. 
 Do you accept the freedom and power God gives you... to resist evil... and oppression in whatever forms they present themselves? 
 I do. 
 Do you confess Jesus Christ as your saviour and promise to serve him as your Lord? 
 I do. 
 Wherever Mr. Gregory Toole is... I'm sure he wishes he hadn't... he hadn't done what he did. 
 It's the nature of this place. 
 Isn't it? 
 Goes and makes you do things that... can't be undone. 
 He gave every man a square deal. 
 He always bought us... a fair share of rounds. 
 He liked to drink. 
 He loved his wife. 
 Today... 
 Today, we bury a brother. 
 May there be a generation of children... on the children... of your children. 
 Amen. 
 Jesus... accept this humble servant... into your heart. 
 Be reborn in the glory of Christ. 
 You alright? 
 Brother Sean, your sins are washed away. 
 I thought the Lord was gonna send the angel Gabriel himself to strike me blind. 
 Well, thankfully, that didn't happen. 
 Oh. 
 Sean. 
 Sean, stop! 
 Good day, Mr. Durant. 
 I thought we had an agreement, Mr. Ferguson. 
 This job you need doin'... 
 Cold feet. 
 Hmm? 
 I would've thought... that you would want to keep your... land, your house... your future. 
 You said after the bridge... 
 The bridge... is complete. 
 It's time, Mr. Ferguson. 
 Good boy. Good boy. 
 "From Major Joshua Short, U.S. Army. Dear Thomas... I received your request for military support. Though I wish I could accommodate all similar requests, unless your scout can provide better intelligence... I'm afraid we can't accommodate you at this time." 
 This is some bullshit! 
 This is the world we live in. 
 We cannot panic every time somebody sees an Indian and bring the work to a halt. 
 Well, guess what? The men are already spooked. 
 Dammit! 
 Thomas. 
 What will you need... to keep them working? 
 Cullen? 
 Mr. Ferguson. 
 Sit down. 
 Did you change your mind about sending it? 
 In case something happen to ya? 
 Mr. Durant have it his way, I'm gonna be shipping it in the morning. 
 You're here to kill me. 
 Mr. Durant promised me my land and my house down on the river. 
 My life is worth... only a few acres of river bottom. 
 It's a nice spot. 
 How are you going to do it? 
 Strangle or cut. 
 Probably cut. 
 You got a reason for me not to? 
 I don't think you're the person the Durants think you are. 
 I done my share of killin'. 
 Not like this. 
 How would you like to be chief of security operations on this railroad? 
 Cullen Bohannon already that. 
 Upon the arrest of the Durants, Mr. Bohannon and I will be his natural replacements. 
 How the Durants arrested? 
 Once that package reaches its destination... 
 ...there'll be a warrant issued for Mr. Durant. 
 For you, a permanent position of respect on this railroad. 
 Do we have a deal? 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 I'll get him. I got him. I'll get him. 
 What is it? 
 Is it Indian? 
 No, ma'am. 
 Mr. Gundersen! 
 Mr. Ferguson came to see me last night. 
 Ah. 
 Well, you... had your chance, Lily. 
 We asked you to leave town nicely. 
 I've told you already, Thomas. I won't be pushed out. 
 You betrayed me to Bohannon... over pillow talk. 
 So you decided to have me killed. 
 It's vulgar, Thomas. Sordid. 
 The railroad is at stake. 
 The railroad. 
 The railroad? 
 I have borne every privation for this railroad! 
 I lost my husband, killed another human being, suffered humiliation at the hands of your wife! 
 I've even endured your bed. 
 That, Lily, makes you a whore. 
 Know, then, that when your precious railroad is ripped from your thick and grasping fingers, that you've been undone by a whore. 
 Why? 
 What have you done? 
 I'll leave you to your... work. 
 When I try... to convince them I was... their White Spirit... they... stretched me on the ground and... they built small fires... upon my body. 
 Oh, God! 
 The pain must be awful. 
 No! 
 I should never have turned to the... the heathens. 
 You should never have lost your place in this town. 
 I have... I have... missed you... seeing you... by your husband's side, eh? 
 Shhh... 
 I'm here now. 
 You must leave this place. 
 Wait! Why? 
 Why must I leave, Mr. Gundersen? 
 The... Sioux... 
 ...are attacking... on the blood moon! 
 Yeah. When's that gonna be? 
 Tomorrow night! 
 Oh, God!! 
 There's no need for that, Mr. Bohannon. Look at him. 
 I doubt he's even gonna make it through the night. 
 Well, friend of yours or not, he's gonna hang for sabotaging the railroad. 
 I'm puttin' a guard on him. 
 Hey, you! 
 Stop! This is not the way! 
 Sonofabitch tried to kill you? 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 You will not kill another man in a rage. I won't have Durant's blood on my hands. 
 Then why the hell d'you tell me? 
 To prove to you, finally, that he has to go. 
 But not this way. 
 You and I can build this railroad together. 
 I've already shipped the ledger. 
 But the board won't take a woman seriously. 
 I can't do this without you. 
 And you're... 
 You're better with me. 
 Aren't you? 
 Yeah... 
 I am. 
 I want you on the first railcar outta here. 
 You ain't gonna be on it, is ya? 
 No. 
 Thought so. 
 Protect our bridge. 
 I'll be here waiting for you when you get back. 
 Y'know how to work a cannon? 
 Cannon? 
 I seen plenty cannon work. 
 You really got one? 
 Mount up. This ain't no place to die. 
 Thanks for not killin' my lady friend. 
 You welcome. 
 Gotta ask you, though. 
 D'you ever gonna do it? 
 You know your Bible? 
 Some. 
 You know when the angel came down, grab a hold of Abraham's arm right before he cut Isaac's neck? 
 Yeah? 
 It wasn't like that. 
 Almost got my ass shot. 
 She ain't a woman to be messed with. 
 True. True, she ain't. 
 Mm. Let's do it. 
 Ahem. 
 If I could have a... quiet word, please. 
 My personal ledgers... 
 ...how damning are they? 
 You ask because you have... lost them, huh? 
 How damning? 
 How far... you are falling... 
 You may fall through the floor... into hell itself. 
 At least a... a prison... in upstate New York. 
 What am I going to do?! 
 You're suffering. 
 That is good. 
 Suffering... builds character. 
 And you will need that... during your incarceration. 
 I will die in prison. 
 That is not true. 
 Come. 
 Come. 
 The truth is... you will not die in prison... but here. 
 Soon... in the streets of Hell on Wheels. 
 Come. 
 Let me kiss you farewell! 
 Get your filthy hands off me!!! 
 
 
 
 Was Durant aware of the impending attack? 
 We did... what we could. 
 Evacuated the women and children, and we armed the rest. 
 Did Mr. Durant attempt to flee? 
 At least not with the women and children. Where is Durant? 
 In custody. 
 God will be with you. And with you. 
 Alright, here we go. 
 Excuse me. 
 There'll be another train in the... in the evening. 
 Please, everybody, stand back. 
 There's room for everyone. Be careful. You alright? 
 Alright, form a single line. One at a time. 
 Give me your bag. 
 Let me help you. 
 Are you leaving? Heading for Council Bluffs? 
 Don't tell me you can't recognize your own travel case, Ruth. 
 You packed my things? 
 Why? 
 As you said... 
 ...I'm going to Council Bluffs. 
 You're coming with me. 
 My place is here. 
 My church. 
 I've taken the liberty... of wiring the mission. 
 We can be wed... tomorrow... noon. 
 Sean, I can't. 
 I have removed every obstacle. 
 I've done everything you've wanted. 
 And I've already given you my answer. 
 I'm not ready, Sean. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This here our ordnance? 
 Can you tell me who's in charge? 
 Lookin' at him. 
 Let's see what you got. 
 Whoo-whoo! 
 Now, that's the kinda sugar Papa like. Mm-hmm. 
 Why ain't you on that damn train? 
 I ain't runnin'. 
 If Bohannon can't hold 'em... 
 I'm goin' to your house. 
 My house? 
 This ain't about you and me. I... 
 It's the safest place to wait out the Sioux. 
 What about after the Sioux? 
 I dunno. 
 Now I got... 
 I got blood on my hands, Elam. 
 It's bad magic and you don't need to be a part of it. 
 Listen here. Mr. Toole ain't on you. He took the coward way out. 
 No, he didn't. 
 No, every man's got his limits, Elam, and... 
 ...he didn't deserve what he got. 
 Don't none of us deserve that. 
 You deserve the hardships you got? 
 You ever think to do like he did? 
 No. 
 No. 'Cause you strong. 
 And that baby gonna be strong. 
 Let's get to that house. 
 Yeah, I know the way. 
 And there weren't no room on the train for the whores. 
 I'd be obliged if you kept 'em safe. 
 Finish our game? 
 Rest... 
 I... 
 ...must have rest. 
 Rest. 
 You okay? 
 Rest!! 
 Shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh. 
 Shhh... 
 Here we go! 
 Make ready! 
 Alright, lads, everybody down. Your guns up. 
 Make sure you see 'em. 
 Take cover! 
 Get down! Get down! 
 Ah!! 
 Positions! 
 Aim... 
 Fire! 
 Now, Psalms, now! 
 Dammit! Where the hell is the runner?! 
 Go find him right now! 
 Over there. Look! 
 They're flanking us, Mickey! 
 Here they come. 
 Here we go. 
 Gilbert, the right flank. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Ready! 
 Prepare to fire! 
 Fire! 
 Give 'em hell! 
 Thomas? Thomas!!! 
 Thomas! Thomas, they're coming!! 
 They're co... 
 They're coming!! 
 You're gonna be alright, Hannah! We are gonna be alright. 
 Now, take this. Take it. It's loaded. 
 Hide in here. 
 Go. 
 And shoot anyone who comes through this door. 
 My brother... The town. 
 Go on back if you have to. I ain't abandoning this bridge. 
 I... 
 Go on! 
 Jesus! 
 Sonofabitch! 
 Stop it! Help me! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Get the hell outta here! 
 Get outta here! It's gonna blow! 
 Get outta here! 
 Rifle! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Elam? 
 Where's Bohannon?! 
 He is where he needs to be. Elam! 
 I'm out. 
 Oh, Ginny! Oh, Ginny, no!! 
 Move her to the bed. 
 Help her. 
 Help her! 
 Ladies, get the hell outta here. 
 We need to help her. 
 Can't nobody help her now. Go! 
 Let's go! Get outta here! 
 Eva. 
 C'mon. C'mon. 
 I'll shoot you. 
 Yes. 
 Fate has taken its hand. 
 No! 
 No!!! 
 Ah!! Ah! 
 No! 
 No!!! 
 No! Please! 
 Please! No!! 
 Shhh. 
 I will be quick. 
 I was kind to you. 
 Yes, you was. 
 I thank you. 
 Cullen will kill you. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, this is all for him. 
 No! 
 No!! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 How is it you decided... to defend the bridge and not the town? 
 I learned in the war to protect strategic assets. 
 The town. 
 The town ain't nothing but wood and canvas. Replaceable. 
 And its inhabitants? 
 Replaceable.

 Ah... beautiful bridge, Mr. Bohannon. 
 An enduring monument to the vision of Mrs. Lily Bell. 
 And your own myopic single-mindedness. 
 I was surprised... that you made it... so easy... to take her from you. 
 Thank you. 
 It was, uh... inexplicably pleasurable. 
 Not as much as it'll be to see you swing. 
 You evil sumbitch. 
 Regrettably not, Mr. Bohannon. 
 For you and I are now... consummated. 
 Are we not? 
 I bid you good day. 
 No! 
 Mr. Bohannon... 
 It's going to take some time to sort this all out. 
 In the meanwhile, the president of the United States has ordered the construction of the railroad to continue. 
 Would you entertain in assuming Mr. Durant's role in leading us westward? 
 Mr. Bohannon... will you finish this road?
