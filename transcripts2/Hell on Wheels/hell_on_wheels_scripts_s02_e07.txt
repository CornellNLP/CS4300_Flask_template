 [Speaks in Sioux language] 
 [Chanting in Sioux language continues] 
 Is he alive, Ma'am? 
 Excuse me. 
 Mr. Toole. Gentlemen. 
 Mr. Durant is currently seeking medical treatment in Chicago. 
 So you don't really know. 
 No. I've not had word yet. 
 What if he dies? Where's that leave us? 
 Well, if... 
 I heard he was already dead when his train pulled out. 
 Look, work will not be interrupted. 
 Progress will continue. 
 Can we count on the wages? 
 Yes. Yes. You'll all be paid on time and in full. 
 And how will you pay us if the old man dies? 
 Mr. Toole... All due respect, Ma'am, but you don't have that kind of power. 
 Y'all shut up and get back to work. 
 Mr. Toole, get these men out to the depot. 
 We got lumber to load this morning. Let's get to it. 
 Right. Let's go, fellas. 
 [Indistinct murmuring] 
 Are you looking for someone? 
 What? 
 You've been staring out that window. 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry about your friend. 
 Dr. Whitehead. 
 [Sighs] 
 We got a bridge to build. 
 Yes. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Indistinct shouting in background] 
 Thank you for coming, Mr. Bohannon. 
 No one else did. 
 My father was very fond of you. 
 He said you and he were kindred spirits. 
 I guess you could say that. 
 We both saw more than our share of bloodshed. 
 I'm the one who put the knife in Joseph's hand. 
 [Grunts] 
 It doesn't matter, Mr. Bohannon. 
 My father got what he wanted. 
 Once, he wanted to be a Christian. 
 In the end, what he really wanted was to be a martyr. 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Sniffles] 
 You didn't kill my father, Mr. Bohannon. 
 And you didn't kill your friend, the doctor. 
 They chose their deaths. 
 You believe, uh... 
 The soul can find peace after all he done? 
 I want to believe he was redeemable. 
 I thought we was all supposed to be redeemable. 
 The truth is, I think some people are beyond redemption. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 Toole: Get that lumber loaded onto that car! 
 You want spuds, you got to work for 'em. 
 Daylight's a-wasting. 
 Mr. Toole. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 I'm working. 
 You got any word from Eva yet? 
 I might've, and mightn't've. 
 Either way, I don't think it's any of your concern. 
 Like it or not, you know exactly why it's my concern. 
 You come here to throw that in me face? 
 I come here 'cause I care about her. 
 Same as you do. 
 Jesus, am I supposed to stand here and take this? 
 I'm her husband, for God's sake. 
 Ain't many husbands would have stood this the way you have. 
 It can't be easy. 
 So, you've come to thank me, then, Mr. Ferguson? 
 Don't push your luck. 
 You sent for me, Mrs. Lily Bell? 
 [Sighs] I did. Thank you for coming so quickly. 
 Mr. Gunderson, I need your help during Mr. Durant's absence. 
 It may only be temporary, but a welcome change, I'm sure. 
 Jah. I'm sorry for what has befallen Mr. Durant. 
 I am happy to help any way I can, Ma'am. 
 Great. 
 Oh! Uh, so, tell me, Jah, what is this problem? 
 These are the problems. 
[Grunts] 
 I was hoping you could help me... 
 Whoa. 
 Can you make sense of these books? 
 Yes. [Chuckles] 
 [Bell ringing] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 What, you're giving it away, Sean? 
 It's a good deed for the Church, Mick. 
 More like for miss Ruth, I'd say. 
 She is the Church in this godforsaken pit, protestant or not. 
 She's got your head all twisted about... 
 Her father was just killed. 
 Where's your sense of charity? 
 I have a sense of charity, but you didn't ask me about it first. 
 We're supposed to be partners, Sean, you and me. 
 You didn't even ask. 
 Can we help you with something? 
 I don't know. Maybe. 
 Heard y'all killers want to take that starlight saloon for yourselves. 
 And why should you care? 
 'Cause I can help. 
 Carl's not keen to sell. 
 He's locked up with a couple of them krauts as well for protection. 
 Since when y'all become scared of a couple of Germans? 
 Got me a plan that will make him sell. 
 And what will you be wanting in return for your help? 
 Nothing. I don't want nothing. 
 'cept a cut of them profits. 
 Piece of land free and clear down by the river. 
 Right. Look... 
 You got yourself a deal, Mr. Ferguson. 
 Well done. All right, then. 
 Got us a deal. 
 All right, then. 
 Have us a lot of drinks. 
 Psalms: Now, hazel, she was a beautiful woman, hear me? 
 She used to come over from marshal's farm to help out with the sewing. 
 Couldn't help but stare, you know what I mean? [Laughs] 
 She was so fine, I was going to make her mine, one way or another. 
 Shoot, I was a lady's man back then, fellas. 
 When there's ladies around, you understand... 
 Psalms, see you're feeling better. Yeah. 
 Good. Then shut up, keep your eye on them hills. 
 You're neglecting your work. 
 I ain't neglected nothing. 
 Work and talk at the same time. 
 Apparently, you can't, 'cause you ain't doing it. 
 So you keep your mouth shut and do what you're paid to do. 
 You understand me, son? 
 I understand you real good. 
 Mr. Bohannon. Pardon me, sir. 
 The darkies talking seems to help them work. 
 Mr. Toole, if I gave a sh1t what you thought, I'd give you a bottle and ask. 
 Enough noise, lads. 
 We got a bridge to build. 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 [Door opens and bell rings] 
 [Whistle blows] 
 Ahh. Good day. 
 I see you let the fox in the henhouse. 
 Mr. Gunderson is helping me. 
 Like hell he is. 
 He was Thomas' bookkeeper for years. 
 I need him here while Thomas is away. 
 Mr. Bohannon, may I have your reports for review? 
 He ain't talking to me, is he? 
 I need to review your work. Please. 
 This right here? This ain't right. 
 Ah. Is that a new rifle, Mr. Bohannon? 
 Matter of fact... It is. 
 Ahh. 
 Took it off one of them dead Sioux that raided the train. 
 [Weapon clicks] 
 Where do you think he got it from, huh? 
 I don't know. 
 Perhaps you should have asked him before you killed him. 
 Really? 
 Mmm. Mr. Bohannon. 
 Put down your rifle and leave. 
 [Exhales] 
 Good day. 
 [Grunts] 
 You look like you're thirsty. 
 [Laughs] 
 Maybe you need a drink tonight. 
 Amen. Thirsty ain't a big enough word for what I'm going to be. 
 How about a barrel? 
 That big enough for you? 
 Heh. What did you mean, barrel? 
 Might be able to help you find one. 
 Hmm. 
 What kind of help we talking about here? 
 [Both chuckle] 
 
 
 
 [Chains rattle and clank] 
 Ahh. 
 See, now, I'm thinking... 
 It was the Sioux made you cut that hair real close. 
 Are you one of the tribe now? 
 No, I cut my hair to avoid those nasty lice, Mr. Bohannon. 
 I do not fraternize with heathens. 
 I know it was you that armed the Indians. 
 And you took a harmless drunk, and you lit a fuse. 
 It's you that's responsible for that massacre out there, and you're going to confess to it. 
 It was wonderful, wasn't it. 
 Jah. Bloodthirsty heathens with modern weapons, led by a drunken white man of God. 
 [Laughing] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Mr. Swede? Yeah? 
 You're out your damn mind. 
 Death is like a balm to men like you and me. 
 We are very much alike, in that way. 
 No. We ain't alike at all. 
 [Grunts] 
 You... Try to tell yourself that you do not like the killing, but you just can't stop, because death is coming for all of us. 
 And in that intimate moment, when the person who is dying is not me... 
 It is invigorating. 
 You must have felt something similar when you choked the life out of Harper. 
 You set me up on that account. That's on you. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Mr. Bohannon, Harper was a terrified, innocent man. 
 You must have felt some doubt as to his guilt. 
 But that doubt... 
[Chuckles] 
 It did not stop your fingers from wrapping 'round his throat. 
 Of course, you also executed your... 
 Your own good friend, the doctor. 
 Hey! 
 He asked me to do that. 
 [Laughs] 
 He asked you to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out, and you agreed? 
 But deep down, you must have felt that certain thrill, Jah? 
 Enjoyed it, even. 
 Right there, your desire to kill me, it brings a familiar... Satisfaction, huh? 
 Right? 
 You're going to confess. 
 [Chains rattle] 
 Confess to what, Mr. Bohannon? Our nature? 
 You don't need my confession. 
 Confession. 
 You only need that to appease Mrs. Lily Bell. 
 [Scoffs] Isn't that right? 
 [Whistle blows] 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 Good job, fellas. Mr. McGinnes! 
 I thought you granted me an extension on the rent. 
 Oh. I wanted to surprise you. 
 It's a land deed. 
 Aye. 
 I secured you a prime plot smack in the center of town. 
 Mr. McGinnes, the Church can't afford to relocate. 
 We won't be able to pay what's due. 
 Ruth, you came to me in my hour of need. 
 I simply want to repay your gesture of kindness. 
 Can I do that? 
 [Door shuts] 
 [Footsteps] 
 Did he confess? 
 Not yet. 
 And you've no other evidence of the crime? 
 [Sighs] 
 Then you'll have to set him free, Mr. Bohannon. 
 Can't do that. 
 Look... 
 I can't keep my promise to pay the men on time if I can't decipher the accounts. 
 I need Mr. Gunderson's help. 
 He's a dangerous man. 
 He's more valuable to me than dangerous to you. 
 We cannot keep him on suspicion alone. 
 Do you understand? You've got to let him out. 
 [Clears throat] 
 On whose authority? 
 You know for whom I'm speaking. 
 All right. 
 Let him out yourself, then. 
 Thank you. 
 [Door shuts] 
 Psalms: Never robbed no train. 
 Elam: This ain't robbing. 
 We're just setting things right. 
 Yeah. Doubt the fat man will see it like that. 
 Fat man got one foot in the grave. 
 What's going on back here? 
 This ain't your business. 
 Oh, now, I don't want no trouble from you Negroes. 
 Well, hell, I just drive the train. 
 Get your ass back in that cab, then. 
 Hurry up. 
 Whoo-ooh! What? 
 Fear of God in that cracker. 
 [Laughter] 
 Ooh-wee! 
 Whoo! Sweet baby Jesus! 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Laughter] 
 I would like to tell you about my imprisonment in Andersonville. 
 I know you will not refuse free whiskey. 
 I hear your... Your Southern prison exposed the bone... 
 The marrow truth of who we are. 
 We? 
 You got a rat in your pocket? 
 Heh. In Andersonville, cold rat meat was a delicacy. 
 And then, of course, human flesh. 
 They watched as we, uh, fought over scraps and they... they laughed. 
 Yeah? 
 We lived in, uh, putrid holes we scratched out of the ground, drinking and defecating in the same water. 
 There's disease, vermin, starvation, and cold, a cold death. 
 All the while, you were watching. 
 When I see you, I see them. 
 I hated you even before we met. 
 [Laughs] 
 But now, you know why you hate me. 
 Huh? 
 You're one insane, evil son of a bitch. 
 Not insane. 
 One day very soon, you will understand that. 
 The reason you hate me is that I am a constant reminder of the capacity for evil that resides... 
 Within you. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, Mr. Swede. 
 [Grunts] 
 That ain't gonna be a problem for either of us anymore. 
 I'm riding out of this mule piss town, and I ain't looking back. 
 Slow. 
 Heh. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Speaks Norwegian] 
 No. 
 You enjoy your new job, Mr. Swede. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Woman laughs] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Man: He's inside, Ma'am. 
 Where are you going? 
 My obligation is to Durant. 
 He's probably dead by now. 
 So much for your honor. 
 No. You don't know nothing about it. 
 I know that when things get hard, you run. 
 You got me all figured out now, huh? 
 You shot and buried your friend. 
 Running away won't change that. 
 [Grunts] 
 Ahh! 
 Give me my bottle. 
 You know I waited for you? 
 At the dance. 
 [Groans] 
 You sure as hell found quick comfort, didn't you? 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 You ran away. 
 You can disagree with my decisions all you'd like. 
 But judging my choices won't change yours. 
 I'm done trying. 
 There. Go. 
 Ahh. 
 Damn it. 
 What the hell? 
 [Horse neighs] 
 [Groans] 
 [Man whistles] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Mr. Ferguson. 
 I sent for you. 
 I ain't your carriage pony. 
 Carl came to see me this morning. 
 Apparently, his whiskey met some saboteurs last night. 
 Dangerous times. 
 Mm-hmm. Yes, sir. 
 Sound like you need to speak to your head of security. 
 I'm speaking with you. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Excuse me. 
 You need somebody killed, then? 
 [Laughter] 
 Carl knows you were behind the sabotage. 
 The engineer said he saw two Negroes... 
 You mean niggers. 
 Look around here, Ms. Bell. 
 There's a lot of us out here. 
 You reckon that engineer could pick out the two he saw? 
 Beg your pardon, Mr. Ferguson, but I'm neither a bigot nor a fool. 
 Kindly speak to me with some respect. 
 I'm good enough for your dirty work, but I ain't good enough for you to trust with security. 
 You're right. 
 When Mr. Durant returns, why don't we renegotiate your position? 
 We don't know if he gonna make it. 
 I'm done negotiating. 
 I quit. 
 You best go. 
 Psalms: Mm-hmm. 
 Get on out of here. 
 [Laughter] 
 Good whiskey, too. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Grunts] 
 Lily. 
 Ahh. 
 You haven't left yet. 
 Yeah. 
 Listen, what you said was true. 
 First thing I did after I buried doc was pack my saddlebags. 
 I was just looking for a reason. 
 Then you let Swede out of the pig car, and just... 
 I was gonna up and run. 
 Just like I always do. 
 You didn't. 
 No. 
 I didn't. 
 My saddlebags are still packed and... 
 Look... 
 Durant's half dead. 
 You know that. 
 He ain't holding me here no more, and neither is that Swedish son of a bitch. 
 Nothing is. 
 Nothing. 
 Why are you still here? 
 I could leave... 
 But... 
 I'm glad that you stayed. 
 [Horse nickers] 
 I believe I have deciphered the books, Ma'am. 
 The mileage numbers from the reports are listed here. 
 But here... huh? 
 The numbers are inflated. 
 Little bit here, little bit there. 
 Difficult to notice unless you're looking, but, well, they add up. 
 The railroad is paid by the mile. 
 It is fraud, Ma'am. 
 [Horse nickers] 
 Heard you quit the railroad. 
 Gonna build me a house. 
 A house? 
 You ever build one? 
 No. 
 How hard can it be? 
 Well, what you gonna do to live? 
 Never figured you for the farming type. 
 I got my ways. 
 Them Sioux ever manage to get organized, I'm gonna need as many guns as I can get. 
 You get tired of homesteadin', come and see me, all right? 
 Then what? 
 Kill the Sioux, finish the road, then what? 
 Ain't no place for me on this railroad. 
 Might want to build that house a little further from the river. 
 Less likely it'll flood and easier to defend. 
 Them Sioux will eventually get organized, and they won't care if you work for the railroad or not. 
 [Clicks tongue] Come on. 
 Ahh! 
 Carl, we have an offer for you. 
 Your niggers destroyed my shipment of whiskey, and you come here wanting to do business? 
 You're mistaken, Carl. 
 We're mates, sure. 
 Ahh, don't insult the man's intelligence, Sean. 
 Let me do the talking, Mick. 
 We had the darkies smash up your whiskey barrels. 
 And if you order another shipment, we'll have them smashed, too. 
 And then, your bar, and then, your tent, and then, I personally will bust your bones to bits and feed your greasy carcass to the pigs outside. 
 If you come anywhere near me or my place, I'll call Hahn and his crew. 
 Hahn? 
[Chuckles] 
 Tell him to bring his friend the butcher, if he can find him. 
 I thought we were mates. 
 We are. 
 Carl, we are. 
 We're mates. 
 This is just business. 
 Sell us the bar, Carl. 
 We'll give you a good price.

 Guess I... better get out to the bridge site. 
 All right.
