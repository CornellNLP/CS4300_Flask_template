 You new in town? 
 Yeah. 
 You lookin' for work? 
 I'm lookin' to do a job on the railroad. 
 [Chatter in background] 
 We'll ride in ones and twos, Morgan here, Burtee here, you got the sawmill, you watch the saloon and the whorehouse. 
 [Coin clinks] 
 You wanna have another go? 
 And, Dennis, you take care of the boxcar guard. 
 Jimmy, you watch from the restaurant. 
 Me, Fitz, and Louie, we'll take the office. 
 Ma'am. 
 Ma'am. 
 Just a blonde girl and a pencil dick with 50,000 in the safe. 
 When them Yankee bastards is out, we slip in and take their payroll. 
 Easier'n butter's greasy, boys. 
 The one guard all we got to worry about? 
 You remember that nigger guard on the train with the gun? 
 The one that buffaloed Bohannon? 
 Strutting around like a big old black rooster. 
 I knew somethin' weren't right with him and Bohannon. 
 And get this, Bohannon himself is working on the railroad. 
 Druther not run into no Bohannon. 
 sh1t, I ain't worried. 
 Besides, he'll be miles away when we take that 50,000. 
 Cullen's alive? 
 Y'all secure them brakes this time. 
 He's walkin' the streets like the risen Christ. 
 Together, Mr. Toole... And heave! 
 All: Pull! 
 Heave... 
 All: Pull! 
 Heave... Pull! 
 Heave... Pull! 
 One more time, we'll have this son of a whore in the air, heave! 
 All: Pull! 
 [Cheering and yelling] 
 That a way, lads! 
 We got her done! 
 Good job! 
 Good work, Mr. Toole. 
 You as well, Mr. Bohannon. 
 All right. Let's shore her up and raise her sister by the end of the day, all right? 
 A huntin' dog looked at me just like that one time. 
 It can be done, Mr. Toole. 
 All right, enough of the peckerplay! 
 We got another one to raise! 
 All right, sir! 
 [Horse nickers] 
 Leave off wearing any rebel garb, boys. 
 Let's not draw eyes on ourselves. 
 Doc, come here. 
 [Thunder] 
 Where you think you're going? 
 It's the last job, right? 
 Well, I need you here to patch up anybody that might need patching up. 
 I'd just as soon ride along on this one if it's all the same to you. 
 You got notions of riding in and warnin' your Mississippi friend, that ain't going to end well for him or you. 
 I wish you'd tell me what's on your mind. 
 I've been thinking about... 
 What I'll do with myself once we reach the Pacific. 
 The Pacific? 
[Chuckles] 
 I've hardly thought past the gorge. 
 Knowing you, you've already written your victory speech. 
 Yes, there will be speeches and deals to be made. 
 And then you'll return to New York. 
 Well, New York is my home. 
 [Sighs] 
 I was just wondering... What will become of me. 
 See you later. 
 Good morning, Reverend. 
 I have made us some strong coffee... 
 Uhh! And a nice hardtack biscuit! Uhh! 
 I trust you slept well, huh? 
 Just... just one drink. 
 Oh, you are like the duck in the song the Negroes sing. 
 If the river were whiskey, you would dive in and never come up, huh? 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 I don't want to do this any longer. 
 Good! You made me promise to keep you locked up, especially when you made such declarations. 
 But I mean it now. As I meant it then! 
 Sit. 
 I can't go on. 
 Ohh. 
 When you have taken strength from your breakfast, huh? 
 Perhaps you can finish your manifesto. Huh? 
 No one... No one cares about that. 
 You were finishing point five of the white man's predilection for racial eradication. 
 Lovely writing, I must say. 
 Passionate without unnecessary histrionics. 
 Though I believe there is an "a" in vengeance. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 You all right, ma'am? 
 I'm fine. Thanks for asking. 
 My pleasure. 
 A bottle. 
 You gonna pay for that? 
 Put it on my tab. 
 Ain't no more room on your tab. 
 [Scoffs] 
You best find some room. 
 Yeah. I-I-I... 
 Rye. Be right there. 
 Ahem. 
 I said rye. 
 All right. Here. 
 So you let niggers drink in here? 
 What you looking at, boy? 
 Trash got a name? 
 Or you just go by "Trash?" 
 Now, Mr. Ferguson, I don't want no more shooting from you. 
 Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson? 
 Now, that's pretty funny. 
 Where you get that pistol, Mr. Trash? 
 This one here? 
 Touch it and I'll blow your head off. 
 Cease fire, gents! 
 [Door closes] 
 My friend here, he gets his neck up when he's drinkin', I apologize. 
 Perhaps you'll allow me to buy this negro gentleman a drink. 
 He usually drinks a bottle. 
 A bottle it is, then. 
 We are leaving and want no trouble. 
 Yeah. 
 [Door opens] 
 Good day to ya. 
 [Door closes] 
 Well, there's two more customers you've done me out of, Mr. Ferguson. 
 You're breaking me! 
 And don't come back! 
 The last time I saw that Griswold Cullen Bohannon was pointing it in my face. 
 It's a common sidearm among the Southerners. 
 It might be the Southerners that's robbing your trains. 
 You recognize them from the robbery? 
 No, sir. But I got a feeling something's up. 
 How so? 
 Payroll come same day they show up? 
 Two white rebels buying a black man a drink? 
 That ain't right. 
 Arm whoever's in town and post them by the railroad office. 
 Nobody in town 'cept shopkeepers and sick list. 
 Well, arm them. 
 Yes, sir! 
 Oh, and send a fast rider to fetch Bohannon. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I understand that, but it's got to be... 
 You two. Come with me. 
 Mr. Ferguson... 
 What can we do for you? 
 You need rifles. Come on. 
 Rifles? 
 It's the Germans. 
 Nah. There's gonna be some trouble. 
 I need men who will kill. 
 Stop! 
 Then why you comin' to us? We're not riflemen. 
 Yeah, we're businessmen, we're not killers. 
 Today you be what I say you be. 
 Come on. 
 Damn. 
 Carl's got guns under the bar. Go get 'em. 
 Right. Go get 'em! 
 Go get 'em now! 
 [Cough] 
 I see you on the sick list again. 
 I'll be back out there tomorrow. 
 I need you help today though. 
 You don't need me. 
 Look, them Johnny Rebs been robbin' the train. 
 They in town. 
 Might be here to steal the payroll. 
 I need your help. 
 [Grunting] 
 [Groans] 
 I don't think I'm up for it. 
 Can you just cover the West road? 
 In case they make a run for it? 
 No! 
 [Bell rings] 
 Lily! 
 I think you should go back to your car. 
 What has happened? 
 Aah! This here is happening. 
 All right, blondie, get over here and open up that safe. 
 Don't do it, lily. 
 And who are you? 
 Thomas Durant. 
 This is my railroad, and that is my payroll. 
 Well, not much longer it ain't. 
 Go on. Get over here. 
 Aah! Stop it! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! No! Thomas! 
 Ah! 
 Get over here and open that damn safe! 
 Please! Please! 
 Open it! 
 [Crying] 
 I heard gunshots. 
 I know. 
 Use Durant's telegraph, tell the fort we being robbed by rebels. 
 The fort's too far away to help. 
 Whatever happens, somebody need to know who done it. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gunshots] 
Whoa. 
 [Neighing] 
 [Women screaming] 
 You ladies get back inside! You wanna die? 
 Get your ass back inside that tent! 
 You move now! Get inside! 
 [Gunfire and screaming in background] 
 [Crying] 
 Woman, if you don't open this safe, we will finish off the old man, do you understand me? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Open the safe! 
 I can't think with that! 
 Ooh! 
 Oh! 
 [Gunshots] 
 Come on now. 
 Take a deep breath. 
 Ahh. Aah! 
 Come on, get out of the way. Go on! 
 Bring that bag! 
 Come on, fill it up. Get them coins, too! 
 Come on, hurry now! 
 Unh! 
 [Laughter] 
 You are a felon! 
 Let's go. 
 [Laughs] 
 Aah! 
 Oh! Damn it, it's Bohannon! 
 Son of a bitch, grab that money! 
 Come on! 
 Hey, Dennis! 
 Here we go. 
 You got you some nice friends. 
 Ain't much fun killin' 'em, but they seem to need it. 
 True words. 
 Let's do it. 
 
 
 
 [Woman screams] 
 Reverend! 
 Listen... 
 Do you hear that? 
 [Gunfire] 
 It's thunder. 
 No, no, no, much sweeter sound. 
 Trumpets. 
 Damn it. 
[Groans] 
 Trumpets announcing the breaking of the seals. 
 Your prophecy. 
 Hyah! Hyah! 
 Ohh! 
 Unh! 
 [Horse neighing] 
 Ahh. 
 Ooh! 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 [Women screaming] 
 No! No! Get back! 
 [Yells] 
Oh! 
 [Women screaming] 
 [Groaning] 
 Uh! 
 Uh! 
 Uh! 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Groaning] 
 Aah! 
 [Groaning] 
 Come on. 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 I got you now, boy. 
 I got you now! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Thomas. 
 Thomas! 
 [Groaning] 
 Hey, hey! Yeah. 
 You wouldn't kill one of your own, unarmed and injured, now, would you? 
 Heh! 
 Someone help! 
 Mr. Durant is dying! 
 Where's doc? 
 [Chuckling] 
 Uh. Aah! 
 Help! 
 Aah! 
 Tell me where is he, you son of a bitch. 
 Hellfire, Bohannon. 
 River camp, two miles East. 
 Lock his ass in the pig car, I'll be back. 
 [Groans] 
 Get your ass up, boy. 
 Get up! 
 Let's use this. 
 What is it? 
 Rag of Clay and black mustard. 
 Indian trick. 
 I done my share of midwife-ing, first thing, we gotta stop the bleeding. 
 [Groaning] 
 Thank you. 
 I need water. 
 Get on up in there. 
 Maybe I get you some. 
 [Screaming] 
 OK. OK, OK. Come on. 
 Water. 
 Water. I need some water. 
 Damn it. Water. 
 Please. 
 [Grunting] 
 Ohh. 
 Here. 
 Fresh and still cool from the rain. 
 [Snorts] 
 Ha. 
 [Grunting] 
 Damn, Cullen. I can't believe... 
 There's people hurt. Grab your bags. Mount up. 
 Well, where's... 
 All of 'em's dead, except Hawkins. 
 Let's go! 
 [Thunder] 
 No. 
 Uh... hands up like that. 
 Angels looking to heaven. 
 Just get going a little bit more for the picture. 
 Oh, sir, may I photograph you looking sorrowfully at this dead whore? 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 Get back to work! 
 [Chatter] 
 Move it! 
 [Chatter] 
 Move the hell out the way. 
 Clear that table. 
 Do it. 
 Cullen, help me get him up there. 
 1, 2, 3. 
 Who is this? 
 He's a doctor. That's all you need to know. 
 Are we too late? 
 [Grunting] 
 [Screaming] 
 Hold him down, for Christ sakes. 
 [Muffled screaming] 
 Shh, shh. 
 [Screaming and crying] 
 I feel ashamed. 
 You done everything you could. 
 For a moment, I felt... 
 Relief that he might not live. 
 You yourself would be free... 
 From your debt to the railroad. 
 Ohh. 
 He ain't dead yet. 
 I should telegraph his wife. 
 She should know. 
 He needs a more qualified surgeon, ma'am, not some battlefield sawbones like me. 
 If I'd run across him like this in the war, I would have moved on to the next man. 
 You best do everything in your power to keep him alive. 
 He needs to be opened up, Cullen. 
 That bullet ripped up his insides, it's lodged against his spine. 
 I don't have the tools or the expertise. 
 Can we take him to Chicago? 
 The ride will probably kill him. 
 I'm doing all I can. 
 Ya couldn't have just ridden on to Mexico, could you? 
 I tried to tell you, Cullen, a hundred times... 
 Uh-uh, no. Uh-uh. 
 'cause there never was any Mexico, was there? 
 Was there, doc? 
 Look what I found. 
 Good. 
 Put 'em on. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, where are we going? 
 You'll find out soon. 
 [Grunting] 
 [All yelling] 
 This ain't right. This ain't right. 
 This ain't fair. 
 I ain't done nothin' you ain't done, Bohannon! 
 Nothin'! You hear me talkin' to you, boy? 
 [Grunting] 
 I get a trial. 
 You can't execute a man without trying him first. 
 That's the law. 
 We still got laws! 
 The president of the United States has spoke. 
 We still got laws! 
 [Thunder] 
 [Grunts] 
 Ah! 
 You was with that railroad the whole time, wasn't ya? 
 Look at me, damn ya. 
 How'd you end up with these Yankee bastards, anyhow? 
 Why you here? 
 You want to say your last words? 
 Yeah. 
 I do. 
 You're a coward, Bohannon. 
 You're yella and I always knowed it. 
 You betrayed your country, son, and everyone in it. 
 Heh. 
 I know something was squirrelly when you let this here nigger get the drop on you. 
 But...[Laughing] 
 I ain't never figured you for no nigger lover. 
 [Laughing] 
[Gunshot] 
 Damn it, Elam, the man wasn't done... 
 You're awake. 
 How's the pain? 
 [Groans] 
 I've got some tincture of opium if you'd like. 
 N-no. 
 It would help you sleep. 
 Uh... no. No. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Can you feel your leg? 
 No. 
 [Grunting] 
 Mr. Durant, I know you're a doctor, so I'm gonna give it to you straight. 
 The bullet, it ruptured your spleen, is probably lodged against your spine. 
 I think it nicked the lineal artery, but I'm sorry, sir, I don't have the means to get in there and fix it. 
 Lily: What do we do? 
 The bleeding's slowing down. 
 He's got a stout heart. 
 I'd risk a train ride. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Ah. 
 Storslatte. 
 You're handsome. 
 Thank you, Thor. 
 Hmm. 
 But... why? 
 Why? 
 Why did you save me? 
 Come and see. 
 Come. Come. Come, come, come, come, come. 
 Come, come, come, come. 
 The lord, holy and true, has saved you, Reverend, not me. 
 To judge and avenge in the name of the dissipated, a great sword is given unto you. 
 Surely now, she pulled our peckers when they needed pulling... 
 [Laughter] 
 Let the twins out to play when they needed some company... 
 Bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh. 
 [Laughing] 
 She petted your head, made you change your drawers. 
 She was the one to say, "it's all right, Mickey, it's all right." 
 [Crying] 
 To Nell, boys! 
 All: To Nell! 
 And to Mr. Bohannon! 
 [All cheering] 
 He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch! 
 [All cheering] 
 Mr. Ferguson, it'd be best if you drink elsewhere tonight. 
 I'm drinking here tonight. 
 Well, you were seen hiding around a boxcar during the robbery. 
 I was in the thick of it. 
 Yeah, from which Mr. Bohannon saved your black bottom. 
 [All cheering] 
 Johnny Reb come flying right at me like a bat out of hell, huh? Eyes wild, horse snortin'... 
 Ha ha! It's him or me... 
 That's right. And I lay him low! 
 Ha ha! Lay him low. That's right. 
 Hold up, y'all. Hold up. 
 You in the wrong place, ain't ya, son? 
 The white folk bar over yonder. 
 Come to drink with y'all. 
 Hmm? 
 All right. 
 See what you got here. 
 Hmm. Tennessee. 
 That there the good stuff. 
 Not that rot gut y'all drink. 
 Hmm. Well, y'all, go on and break that open. Hmm? 
 Enjoy yourself. 
 Guess me and you down to the rot gut. Hmm. 
 Good stuff. 
 [Coughing] 
 sh1t'll make you blind. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Make you see the good lord first though. 
 You ever wonder what'll happen to y'all if old man Durant die? 
 Reckon we be on the first train smokin' back to Georgia. 
 How about you? 
 What about me? 
 How long you think you gonna last in this town... 
 Without him to protect you? 
 Hmm? 
 Just be another nigger in the white man world. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Laughing] 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
 Is he dead? 
 No. 
 No. I already buried Hawkins. 
 It says "all those aiding and abetting." 
 But doc... doc just held the horses. 
 I'm sorry, Cullen.
