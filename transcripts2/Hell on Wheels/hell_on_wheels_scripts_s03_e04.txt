 Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels... 
 Tell me about Moretti... 
 How do you know about Moretti? 
 She's beautiful. 
 It's our custom to marry your brother's widow, become a father to his child. 
 You stay away from my family! 
 Chief of Police, Union Pacific Railroad. 
 Did you kill our man, son? 
 Tell me the truth! 
 History always sides with the winner. 
 This ain't over. 
 Indeed, it is not. 
 [Mule brays]

 Squaws! 
 Jimmy Two Squaws? 
 Jimmy Two Squaws?

 [Horse whinnies, mule brays] 
 Holster your hardware and declare your intentions.

 'Twould behoove you to oblige. 
 [Pistol safety clicks] 
 We're with the railroad. 
 Looking for a guide to take us through Indian territory. 
 Haden send you? 
 He's my surveyor. 
 Says you speak Kiowa. 
 Now what do you want with the Kiowa? 
 Just trade. 
 Haden says the Kiowa got a copse of spruce. 
 Well, the Indians around these parts say that you took heads off of peaceful women and children. 
 Thems was Bluecoats. That wasn't me. 
 And they was acting on behalf of the railroad. 
 And they ain't here right now. I don't want no bloodshed. 
 Where you from, boy? 
 Union Pacific Railroad. 
 No. 
 No, no, no. I mean where was you borned at? 
 sh1t. 
 Meridian, Mississippi. 
 I knew it. 
 [Women shouting indistinctly] 
 Yes, sir, you got Mississippi river water on your tongue. 
 Me, I'm from Louisiana. 
 My daddy was a fur trader. 
 My mama was a slaver's daughter in New Orleans. 
 I used to go to New Orleans once a year before the war. 
 Cotton farmer? 
 No, failed tobacco. 
 I used to stay at the St. Charles Hotel right there on the avenue. 
 Well. Huh. 
 I went through there once myself. 
 Had me a sazerac. 
 Hey, how 'bout you lower that rifle? 
 You know, your surveyor Haden, he ain't half-bad for a mud chicken. 
 And the Kiowa got spruce. 
 But now, Chief Red Bear, he ain't an easy man to bargain with. 
 I need you to translate for me. 
 Pay is in gold eagles. 
 Hmm. 
 The last man that paid me in coin gave me pesos back in Santa Fe. 
 The Kiowa scalped him, and they rolled his people back to Chihuahua. 
 You can keep your gold eagles. 
 But now, I can't leave my Squaws here empty-handed. 
 Well, what would appease? 
 Well, I reckon that they would be happy with your mule here and the contents of its pack. 
 Red Bear ain't got no use for no white man groceries. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
Come on. 
 [Mule brays] 
 All right, then. 
 What? 
 He--he ain't right in the head. 
 We need him. 
 What you need me for? 
 You got someplace else you'd rather be? 
 Mm-hmm, I could think of a few place. 
 [Women shouting indistinctly] 
 Let's ride. 
 I got business with Red Bear. 
 [Shouting continues] 
 Go, go. 
[Shouting continues] 
 He gonna get us killed. 
 Well, that's why you're here. 
 So he don't.

 Yeah, I got me a young Squaw and an old Squaw. 
 And the young Squaw is lazy. 
 But the problem is is that the old Squaw used to be the young Squaw, and she's lazy too. 
 And now, all they do is fight about who's doing what. 
 And neither one of them is doing anything but fightin'. 
 And that's why I sleep on the roof. 
 Oh, now, I might go down there if I want a little jackrabbit stew or-- or if I feel my sap a-rising. 
 How about you back there? 
 You got you a woman there, sourpuss? 
 And a baby girl. 
 Then what the hell are you doing out here for? 
 Putting food in they mouth, roof over they head. 
 Mm. 
 You know what the Kiowa do to strangers? 
 They like to set fires. 
 Fires to your hands, fires to your face, fire to your chest. 
 Hell, I seen a Texan one time stark naked, tied to a post. 
 And they had relieved him of his scalp, his fingers, and his plums. 
 But then, they shoved hot coals under his skin. 
 They watched him slow roast. 
 Good thing you ain't a stranger, then. 
 No, no, I am not. 
 I'm family. 
 Red Bear is my father-in-law.

 [Wheels screech] 
 Put the big bells on the bottom of that fork, will ya? 
 [Steam whistle blows] 
 Big ones over there. 
 [Steam whistle blows] 
 For Christ's sake, McGinnes, I didn't die. 
 You were locked up in the clink last I heard. 
 I wintered on Hudson. 
 Surely, no one will begrudge a man his past in this citadel of freethinkers. 
 Mr. Durant. 
 What brings you to Hell on Wheels? 
 [Wheels screech] 
 Engine fire? 
 A spark ignited the hay car and the blaze spread. 
 We lost an entire shipment of ties. 
 Kinda interesting, you showing up here, what with Mr. Bohannon gone and all. 
 Relax, Mickey. 
 I am just a stockholder checking in on his investment. 
 [Bell ringing] 
 "Hotel." 
 [Rings bell forcefully] 
 The New York  Tribune. 
 Hmm. 
 Madam, I once had the displeasure of meeting its editor, Horace Greeley. 
 Utopian, whig, vegetarian. 
 I hear he has Karl Marx writing for him now. 
 Have you read  Das Kapital? 
 [Scoffs] 
 The ignorant ravings of an overeducated gasbag. 
 I would like a room, your largest suite. 
 The suite's taken. 
 By whom? 
 Her. 
 Miss Ellison. 
 Miss Louise Ellison of the New York  Tribune. 
 Uh... 
[Clears throat] 
 Thomas C. Durant of Credit Mobilier. 
 I know who you are, Mr. Durant. 
 Oh, perhaps, um, I could compose a statement for you. 
 I'd be happy to read it. 
 You can usually find me here when I'm not at the end of the hall... in the suite. 
 [Knock at door] 
 The man of the house is out. 
 The man of the house is dead. 
 I just wanna see the child. 
 You have my word. 
 No harm'll come to either of you. 
 All right. You can see her. 
 But then you gotta leave. 
 Just say the word. 
 Hey. 
 [Baby fussing] 
 Oh, come here now. 
 [Laughs] 
 Isn't she gorgeous? 
 Spit of her father. 
 Puts me in mind of my son. 
 You have a son? 
 Patrick. 
 He and his mother were taken by the influenza. 
 I know a little about what you've been through. 
 Hey. 
 Elam wouldn't want you here long. 
 [Baby fussing] 
 Elam's a decent fella, Eva, a testament to his race. 
 But that child doesn't belong to him. 
 She deserves better. 
 As do you. 
 You don't know what I deserve. 
 I know your past. 
 And I don't judge it. 
 [Baby crying fitfully] 
 Everyone deserves a fresh start. 
 Come away with me to New York. 
 We'll get married. 
 This wee one will be raised a clean catholic instead of some black b*st*rd's b*st*rd child. 
 I asked you to leave. 
 [Sighs] 
Your heart knows what's right. 
 I can wait.

Oh! 
 This is Red Bear. He wants your horse. 
 I need my horse. 
 Well, the trouble is I owe him a horse. 
 Well, give him your horse. 
 He likes yours better. 
 This buckskin that he wears, it holds the ashes of his eldest son who was killed by the cavalry. 
 You tell him I lost a son to the Bluecoats too. 
 Tell him. 
 [Speaking Kiowa] 
 He can have the horse. 
 [Speaking Kiowa] 
 What about the trees? 
 [Both speaking Kiowa] 
 [Pistol clicks] 
 [Speaking Kiowa] 
 Well, he says you can take the one-leggeds, but only if you can beat his son and braves at a game of stickball. 
 Stickball? 
 Red Bear learned it off of some Choctaw. 
 He's made it an initiation rite for his fiercest braves. 
 Look, Jimmy looking out for Jimmy. 
 We don't know what he telling them, getting us into. 
 Railroad needs them trees. I gotta play. 
 You do what you want. 
 It ain't what I want. 
 But I'll do it. 
 Tell him we'll play for the trees.

 Papa says I'm the best at finding nests. 
 Ah. 
 I have a sharp eye, he says, as good as any eagle's. 
 Don't fall and crack your head, for an eagle is a noble bird, an excellent predator and one who is not above eating carrion when he must. 
 Papa's very wise. 
 That's why we're moving to Fort Smith. 
 I can't reach it. 
 [Groans] 
 All right, closer to the edge we go. 
 [Chuckles] 
 And what is the wisdom of moving to Fort Smith? 
 We were called there by Brigham Young. 
 Their bishop was killed when one of the gentiles tried to steal his youngest wife. 
 And now, they are a flock without a shepherd. 
 Huh, will your father be that shepherd? 
 Papa's gonna be a bishop. 
 A bishop? 
 He'll be the most powerful man in all of Fort Smith. 
 Hmm. 
 [Sighs] 
I got the eggs. 
 Ha! 
 Should we go back? 
 Nah. 
 Let us find another nest, huh, eagle eye? 
 You can tell me more about your Papa, hmm? 
 [Rhythmic drumbeats] 
 Oh. Here come your opponents. 
 [Snorts] 
 Their mamas know they're out here? 
 That scarred-up one is Red Bear's son. 
 They have raided and killed red and white alike. 
 It'd be a mistake to underestimate him. 
 [Speaking Kiowa] 
 He's gonna give you another player to even the odds. 
 He's a captive from another tribe. 
 [Speaking Kiowa] 
 This is little raven. He's gonna play with you. 
 He's a good warrior.

 Get out there. Go on out there.

 Lose or quit, you die. Told you before. 
 Didn't I? 
 Come on now. 
 Jimmy fixed this up to settle his gambling debts.

 Yes, sir. 
 Mattress, sheets, the lot, burn it. 
 Mickey. 
 Why are you throwing her out?

 I can't have her dying here. 
 I gave her train fare to Omaha. She can see a doctor. 
 No, a doctor ain't gonna do nothin' for her. 
 Take everything, boys. 
 She's gonna die bad, Mickey. 
 I know. 
 Thank God for Mr. Toole, aye? 
 Mr. Toole? 
 Mm. 
 If he hadn't married you, it might be you on your way to Omaha for some sick bed. 
 You think I don't know that? 
 You might wanna keep it in mind.

 A Madonna and child for the new world. 
 I've just been reading about you. 
 Sorry? 
 Hmm. 
 Is that-- is that supposed to be me? 
 Well, the sketch is not very good. 
 But the--the article's not bad. 
 Take it home. 
 Eva, what is it? 
 Mr. Toole's brother is in Hell on Wheels and he wants this child. 
 And sometimes... 
 I'm not a very good woman, Mr. Durant. 
 That is rubbish. 
 I will never forget you holding my hand as I lay bleeding out on my desk, through pain, laudanum, every accompanying indignity. 
 You are an exceptional woman who is in a vexing situation. 
 What should I do? 
 I have something for you. 
 A baby gift.
