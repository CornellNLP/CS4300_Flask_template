 Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels. 
 Payroll train's been robbed again. 
 Seems we'll be needing your services. 
 You ain't gonna believe this boy. 
 What are you doin' here? 
 Tryin' to keep you from gettin' yourself killed. 
 You don't believe in me anymore. 
 Nobody's gonna care about the killing of a prostitute. 
 Would you like to join us for supper? 
 Look how far I've fallen. 
 The Sioux believe this land is scared. 
 I call the shots here, not you. 
 Wake up cause you're next. 
 Here, Jenny. 
 Got some feed. 
 Bessie. 
 Mr. Toole! 
 Rise and shine! 
 Morning, Samuel. 
 Ehh. 
 Samuel! 
 Samuel, did you hear that? 
 I don't want to. Put me down! 
 Aaigh! 
 Now, Mr. Bohannon, you are guilty of armed robbery and sedition, a capital offense. 
 I may be able to get that commuted to life if you give me the names of your cohorts. 
 Yeah. I might just fly my ass out of here if I sprout me some wings. Heh heh. 
 Now, let's try this again. 
 The names of the confederates you rode with. 
 You think they wouldn't give you up in a heartbeat if they were in your spot? 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. 
 I'll tell you. I'll tell you their names, all right? 
 Wise decision. 
 Their... their names were... 
 Robert... 
 Jeb Stuart, Nathan Bedford forr... leave him! 
 Mitt herredømme? 
 What in God's name is... sorry to disturb your slumber, mitt herredømme, but I was passing the railroad office. 
 An important, urgent message has arrived. 
 You may retrieve my chamber pot at a more reasonable hour, Gundersen. 
 Of course. 
 Good day. 
 Thomas, what is it? 
 Indians. Attacked Durant. 
 Apparently burned the place to the ground. 
 Let's go! We got to get moving! 
 Everybody! 
 Mr. Ferguson! 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Thought you might need my help, sir. 
 No, I need you here to protect my railroad. 
 Yes, sir, Mr. Durant, sir. 
 Potatoes, meat, what's left of the cheese. 
 This blanket is thin, so keep your coat buttoned tight. 
 Ruth, I'm only gonna be gone a day. 
 To keep you safe. 
 Child. 
 You have forsaken me. 
 Father! 
 Why did you not come to me when you heard? 
 Because we have no use for you. 
 But I... I can help stop the bloodshed. 
 Jesus... Jesus said... that Bible means nothing to them, reverend. 
 I know you view our relations with these savages as some kind of divine mission. 
 Trust me, God has forsaken all of us. 
 Your services are not necessary. 
 Father, sorry. 
 I'll be home soon. 
 Sit down. 
 What happened, Mr. Toole? 
 A band of braves rode in from the west, attacked at daybreak, scorched the very earth. 
 Ying did they damage the track? 
 Not as I can tell, sir. 
 Steal anything? 
 No, sir. 
 How many killed? 
 7 men and 2 women. 
 Bleedin' savages. 
 What tribe? 
 You even know how to tell? 
 Sorry. I was too busy saving me lily-white arse, if you know what I mean. 
 They didn't look like Cheyenne to me, if that's what you're wondering. 
 There they are! 
 They're Santee Sioux. 
 Sioux? 
 But this is Cheyenne territory. 
 Why are they attacking so far from home? 
 This was a murder raid. 
 They're sending you a message. 
 What message? 
 That you're now at war with the Sioux nation. 
 Ying ying you got a visitor. 
 Visitor? 
 Make it fast. 
 What in the hell are you doing here? 
 Don't worry. Paid them guards a nice stack of yankee bills. 
 Stupid ass. 
 They, uh... 
 They tell you when yet? 
 It's bound to be soon. 
 They're running out of people to shoot. 
 I'm sorry, Cullen. 
 Don't start, doc. 
 I got you caught up in this nonsense to begin with. 
 I, uh... 
 I should have never dragged you into it. 
 You and me's square. 
 Now get the hell on out of here. 
 You make your peace yet, son? 
 What you suppose the lord's gonna think about a man like me, huh? 
 He knows what's in your heart. 
 I murdered a man. 
 He was innocent. 
 I wrapped my hands around his throat, and I looked him in the eyes, and I choked the life right out of him. 
 I know you must feel... you must feel bad about that, son. 
 That's just the thing. 
 I don't feel nothing about that. 
 Not a damn thing. 
 It's time. Come on, now. 
 I'll pray for you, son. 
 If you're gonna pray, pray for me to die well, doc. 
 That's all I got left. 
 A small deposit will secure a lot fit for tent accommodations. 
 However, the tents themselves are for sale, not rent, but for a slightly larger deposit, you can pitch your flag closer to town. 
 Mr. McGinnes. Yeah? 
 These people lost everything. 
 They need shelter. 
 What size lot can they afford? 
 Really, Mr. McGinnes. We'll not profit or further people's misery. 
 Bloody good that, coming from an englishwoman. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 Ah, you people built an empire of misery on the backs of the Irish and everyone else, haven't you? 
 The point is, Mr. McGinnes, that these people need a place to live, and we have land here, for everyone. 
 Mr. Durant, with whom I have an agreement, has land. 
 Do you speak for him? 
 As a matter of fact, I do. 
 My agreement with Mr. Durant states my percentage for brokering his land, plus a stake in all tents I provide. 
 Then we'll negotiate a settlement. 
 How's that, Mr. McGinnes? 
 And my brokerage fee. 
 Of course. 
 After all, this is not England or Ireland, is it? 
 It is, in fact, America, Mrs. Bell. 
 Yes, and welcome to it. 
 Good day, Mr. McGinnes. 
 As I was saying... 
 Ready... 
 Fire! 
 Afternoon, boys. 
 Going out to play in the water again? 
 Hold him tight. I got to get the... hang on. 
 Take him out. 
 Thought you liked me, boys. 
 Give it a go. 
 Hold him! 
 Come on. It takes 3 of y'all to kill one confederate? 
 You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. 
 Keep moving. 
 You sons of bitches gonna answer me? 
 Just do it. Get it over with. 
 You still there? 
 Where the hell did y'all go? 
 I was ready. 
 Get back in here. 
 I'll skin your asses alive and run you back across the bull run! 
 Come on and finish this job right now! 
 What's the rush, Mr. Bohannon? 
 I just heard about, um... 
 The girl who died here a few days ago. 
 Yes. Um, the whore who was murdered. 
 She was my friend. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You should know, Eva, I... I did secure her a proper burial. 
 Yeah. All due respect, a burial don't do nothing for the girls still there, and I want the man responsible to pay for what he did. 
 Eva, the situation... 
 It would be difficult to convince people to do the right thing. 
 Because she was as whore? 
 No. I didn't say that. 
 She didn't deserve what she got. 
 I understand. 
 What the hell you doing here, anyway? 
 This is a warrant for your execution. 
 Yeah. No sh1t. 
 And this... Is a pardon... Signed by my friend Edwin Stanton, secretary of war. 
 Playing God comes natural to you, don't it? 
 Well, yes, it does. 
 But like any benevolent God... I'm here to help you. 
 I'm supposed to believe you don't want nothing out of this? 
 On the contrary. 
 My motives are purely selfish. 
 But that is not to say that you can't benefit as well. 
 You have a lot of unfinished business on this earth, Mr. Bohannon. 
 What will it be... life... 
 Or death? 
 I hope it's first-class. 
 All right. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 You sure you got to do that? 
 That's for robbing my railroad. 
 It takes a tragedy to fill our church. 
 God is at work. 
 His ways are mysterious. 
 Maybe your God works too hard. 
 He is our God, Joseph. 
 Father. You should be in bed. 
 How sharper than a serpent's tooth. 
 And he maketh... 
 His angels to the wind and his minister into the flame of fire. 
 Father, stop. 
 These people have lost their homes. 
 This isn't the time. 
 Go... 
 Please? 
 Don't judge, or you, too, will be judged. 
 You, too. 
 Reverend... 
 Please, father. 
 No. 
 This is my church. 
 It's best you go. 
 Welcome back. 
 Well, if it ain't Mr. Ferguson. 
 Sad state of affairs right here. 
 You come here to gloat? 
 No. No, no. 
 I come to give you this. 
 Something to see you through till you get back on your feet. 
 I don't think so. 
 Your husband ain't gonna approve? 
 No. I don't approve. 
 And why don't you save that money for one of them fancy suits? 
 I was just trying to help. 
 A whole race of people will be wiped off the face of the earth by this iron beast. 
 Perhaps. 
 Then again... 
 Maybe the sioux have a beast of their own. 
 Have you heard of the white spirit, reverend Cole? 
 It's an old Indian legend. 
 Aye. Oh, it's more than a legend. 
 Now is his season... 
 For the white spirit comes with the cold, feasting on blood and human flesh, leaving nothing but famine and pestilence for his enemies. 
 And I look... 
 And behold the pale horse. 
 Nej. 
 Whose name... 
 It's his name that sat on him was death. 
 And hell will follow with him. 
 "Revelation"? 
 Yeah. 
 Yes... 
 It will be apocalyptic. 
 Yeah. 
 Where a tide of blood will be unleashed. 
 Indian blood, no doubt. 
 Nej, nej, nej. 
 The white spirit will prevail. 
 I don't believe such things, Swede. 
 Ahh. All right. 
 May I show you something, then? 
 Heh. 
 What the... 
 I dug this up by the river side. 
 What in... what in God's name is this? 
 There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy, reverend Cole.

 I ain't drunk out of it if that's what you're wondering. 
 What can I do for you? 
 I want you to... 
 Deal with the man who killed the prostitute. 
 What you mean, "deal with"? 
 I want to be sure he never does it again. 
 Oh. You want me to give him a good talking to. 
 You know that's not what I mean. 
 Then say it. 
 Mr. Ferguson. 
 Say it. 
 I want him punished. 
 I'm afraid I can't oblige you on that, ma'am. 
 Fine. 
 I'll tell Eva that's what you said.

 I can't help wondering... 
 I haven't made a grave mistake. 
 I'm beginning to come around to the same conclusion. 
 I think you should thank me. 
 I tell you what... 
 I'll say you're welcome. 
 I could always make you. 
 Nah, I don't think so. 
 You don't know a thing about me, Bohannon. 
 Well, I know... 
 I know you're the type of man that likes to do his dirty work from a distance. 
 Not up close like this. 
 Who's the executioner now, huh? 
 Why don't you ask me for a stay, huh? 
 No. 
 Sometimes it seems... 
 One has to make a deal with the devil. 
 Who's the devil in this deal, huh? 
 Oh. 
 Here you go. 
 Mornin'. 
 Something I can do for you? 
 Don't know. 
 Is there? 
 Maybe there is something you can do for me. 
 And what would that be? 
 I got me a whore that needs killing. 
 I can't help you. 
 I heard you can. 
 Heard you the last customer that poor girl had the night before she got beat to death. 
 You better watch yourself, boy. 
 The only thing worth less in this town than a dead whore, a nigger don't know his place. 
 So will you do it for me? 
 You know who I am? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Mr. schmidt, foreman of the railroad... 
 And whore killer. 
 I just need you to tell me you did it before I shoot you in the gut. 
 You're not gonna shoot me. 
 Everybody would hear. 
 Yes, I killed the bitch. 
 You right. 
 I ain't gonna shoot you right now. 
 I like what you done with the place. 
 Like I said, you have your work cut out for you, Bohannon. 
 What's to keep me from lighting out of here first chance I get, huh? 
 For a man like you, his word is stronger than any set of shackles. 
 But if I'm wrong, I could always get him to shoot you.
