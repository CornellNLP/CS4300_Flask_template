 (phone ringing) 
 Man (over phone) : Where are you? 
 I'm at the hospital with the asset. 
 Someone's coming. You need to get him out of there now. 
 Hurry. You don't have much time. 
 Sir, this floor is off-limits to visitors. 
 Hospital's been compromised. 
 Request immediate exfil to Edwards. 
 Man : Already on my way. I'll pick you and the asset up in ten. 
 Hurry. 
 Where are we going? 
 Somewhere safe. 
 And, Sarah, remember, from here on out, stay in legend. 
 Copy that. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm your wife. 
 (rhythmic beeping) 
 Hi. 
 Thank you. 
 Hi. 
 Is Mom gonna be okay? 
 Uh, she's... 
 She-she's gonna be all right. 
 Sit down. 
 How are you doing? 
 I'm okay. 
 You're a brave boy. 
 You know that? 
 I'm proud of you. 
 Proud of you for staying strong. 
 Dad? 
 Catch them. 
 The guys who did this. 
 I will. 
 I love you, son. 
 I love you, too. 
 (door opens) 
 Hi. Well, thank your wife for taking Aiden tonight. 
 It's no problem. 
 Hey, are you hungry? All right. 
 Hey, I'll see you first thing tomorrow morning, promise. 
 Crystal : How's Sonya doing? 
 She's lucky is what she is. 
 We're gonna keep her safe. 
 She's under another name. We have agents all over this hospital. 
 I'm sorry that your family had to go through this. 
 I spoke to my dad. 
 Ah. Did hell freeze over? 
 (laughs) 
 And what did the vice admiral have to say? 
 Operation Raining Fire. 
 It was a cover-up. 
 It was one of worst friendly fire incidents during the Iraq War. 
 We bombed our own position at an oil rig in Basra in 2004. 
 Almost 400 people died, including a full platoon of Marines. 
 Why would we bomb our own soldiers? 
 I don't know. The rig was overseen by Verax. 
 They're trying to hide the details. 
 Okay. 
 It's your turn. No more putting me off. 
 There was no car accident. 
 I was there. 
 I was in Iraq. 
 That's where I was injured. 
 I don't remember much, just pieces, but... it was bad. 
 So, Verax is worried because they think that you're gonna expose their involvement in Raining Fire? 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe there's something more. 
 Martin Odum is a legend. 
 My true identity's classified. 
 I don't know my own name. 
 My God, Martin. 
 You've been living a legend for almost ten years. 
 I'm the man who knows too much. 
 Except I forgot. 
 Spiller :  This briefing is to be kept strictly confidential. 
 No one is to share any details of this investigation with anyone outside DCO. 
 From now on, anything Verax stays inside this room, and you should all be deeply concerned that Verax was able to find the safe house. 
 Rice : You're saying Verax has agents within the FBI. 
 No one outside the agency could have known where Martin was, so, we have to assume that the Bureau has been compromised. 
 Spiller : We can confirm that Verax is planning some kind of operation inside the U.S. 
 Our suspicions are based on communications intercepts centered on this man. 
 John Cameron. 
 He was part of Verax's operation during the Iraq War. 
 Personally, I think he orchestrated the assault on the safe house, and on Martin specifically. 
 Other than that, we don't know much about him. 
 Now we believe he's plotting an attack on American soil. 
 We have got to find this guy, people. 
 I spoke with the prime asset. 
 The plan continues apace. 
 You seem troubled, Tomlin. 
 We're targeting an American on American soil. 
 It's crossing the line. 
 There's no line. 
 The world is changing. 
 Borders don't matter. 
 States, governments don't matter. 
 Sovereignty is reserved for those with the means to dictate outcomes. 
 That's us. 
 Fortune favors the bold. 
 We're moving forward with the plan. 
 It's time for a change in leadership. 
 But the risk profile is not insignificant. 
 The only risk is doing nothing. 
 Our asset will take over the one federal agency posing a threat to us. 
 John Cameron will take care of Martin Odum. 
 And Odum takes the fall. 
 Verax didn't know who they were messing with when they sent these guys after you at that safe house. 
 (camera shutter clicking) 
 Maggie, you seeing this? 
 Yeah, I got it. 
 I'm running facial recognition now. 
 It's not bringing anything up on face rec. 
 That's weird. 
 (clicks) 
 Rice : Operation Enduring Freedom. 
 He was a Ranger. 
 Okay, I'm pulling up 82nd's personnel list from '04, '06. 
 Servicemen should be in the system. 
 Wait a minute. 
 There's a reason you can't find him. 
 He's had plastic surgery. 
 Yeah? Didn't want anyone to know who he was. 
 Maggie : Hey, guys, wait a minute. Go back to his arm. 
 There's some kind of rectangular shadow below his tattoo. 
 Do you see it? 
 Rice : You sure? There's nothing there. 
 Hey, I know this sounds crazy, but put the infrared filter on your camera. 
 (beeping) 
 Oh, nice get, Mags. 
 Very impressed. 
 Any idea what the code means? 
 Somehow, I don't think it's his meth dealer's cell phone. 
 Martin :  Martin Odum is a legend... Odum is a legend. 
 Did I work for Verax...  Verax? 
 Yes. 
 I'm the man who knows too much. 
 Except I forgot...  except I forgot. 
 Verax does know. They were in Iraq,  2004... 2004. 
 Let me see your phone. 
 (beeping) 
 Looks like he went to the same ink joints as me. 
 I've been trying for hours, and I still can't make heads or tails of these tattoos. 
 They're not socials, they're not cells. 
 They aren't anything. They're just a jumble of numbers and letters. 
 They're employee identification codes for Verax. I had friends at the NSA check the codes. 
 I hope they didn't send up any red flags. 
 They covered their inquiries. 
 There are a lot of people out there who share our concerns about Verax. You can trust the information. 
 What about Martin's tattoo? Anything come up? 
 They looked at a few files, but... 
 Let me guess, no trace. 
 They were redacted. 
 The merc's name is Trent McFadyen. 
 He's a Green Beret. Three tours in Afghanistan. 
 Suspected of war crimes atrocities while working for Verax in 2007. 
 His last known address is in Echo Park on Alvarado. 
 Oh, forget it. 
 Crystal : Looks like we got the right place. 
 Martin : Yeah, they're not plotting some random attack. 
 It's an assassination. 
 This baby's got a range of 1,500 meters. 
 Yeah, so who's the target? 
 (beep) 
 Found a burner phone and some cash. 
 I'm going to run the serial numbers off this money. 
 We need to get Forensics in here. 
 Forensics won't find anything. 
 This guy doesn't make mistakes. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hello? 
 Man : I hear you've been looking for me. 
 Who is this? 
 Real proud of yourself, putting my guys in the morgue. 
 Cameron. 
 (quietly): Maggie, trace the incoming call on Martin's phone right now. 
 Okay, Crystal. Give me a second. It's encrypted. 
 I'm on it just as long as it's not a 2048-bit algorithm. 
 Man : Good bit of work finding my apartment. 
 That's a nice rifle you got here. 
 I've got others. 
 And now I know you're looking for me, my timetable just moved up. 
 Yeah? Who's the target? 
 Always asking questions. 
 Good to see you haven't changed since we last saw each other. 
 Yeah. Is this back in Iraq? 
 So it's true then. 
 You don't remember what happened. 
 When the bombs fell. 
 I know who you are. 
 Cameron. 
 I don't think you do. 
 And I don't think you know what I'm capable of. 
 But you'll see. 
 The blood will be on your hands. 
 (line clicks, dial tone drones) 
 Martin :  Martin Odum is a legend. 
 I'm not who I think I am. McCombs :  There is no Martin Odum. He doesn't exist. Martin :  I want the truth, damn it! You said it was all in my head, but it's not, is it? You've been lying to me. Rice : Okay? Not until we find this guy. I reached out to a friend of mine at the Treasury. I gave him the serial numbers of some of the cash we found. Yeah? He did a trace. These bills were part of a cash shipment to Iraq. Pacification funds. Paying off the enemy. How'd they get here? My buddy says it's the... dirty little secret of the war. Over a billion dollars went missing. (indistinct shouting) Rice :  First they thought the Iraqis were hijacking the trucks. Then they started thinking that it was an inside job. And guess where the trail led back to. Verax. Rice :  Nobody wants to say it but, yeah, Verax. (indistinct shouting) (gunshots) They killed American soldiers, man. Executed 'em. And guess who the prime suspect was. Cameron. Rice :  Then all of a sudden the money just disappears, just like that. Were you there, Martin? Were you there with Verax? In Iraq? Were you there? McCombs and Evans, they were. Were you there when they stole that cash? Is that what this is about? Were you part of the heist? Still nothing on the burner phone, but Maggie traced the call that Martin got to a motel off Route 14. Let's get Cameron. Let's go. Maggie says the call definitely came from there. No activity. Let me take a look. I'll be right back. You doing okay? Do you think I'm a good man? What do you mean? Just after what happened to Sonya and Aiden. You know I had to do things in legend, hmm? Violence. You were sanctioned, Martin. It's not the FBI sanction I'm worried about. (laughs) You worry you're gonna have to answer for what you did undercover. I don't know who I am. Don't know what my soul looks like. I think you're a good man. (car door opens) All right, place looks deserted. There's a car down there that's missing a front tire. And some truck that looks like it hasn't been moved in years. Wouldn't mind a closer look at that. All these room's are padlocked. (grunts) No one's been here in a while. He was here. Cameron. He wanted me to find this. It's Iraq. I don't like this. We better get out of here. I agree. Let's go. (door closes) Come on, let's go! Let's go! (tires squealing) It's got to be Verax. No doubt. Move it, Rice! Rice : We got more company! sh1t! They have Martin! They have Martin! Martin! Gates : Where are they? Maggie : I'm trying all three lines, sir. Nobody is responding. Keep trying. Maggie : They wouldn't go dark without telling us. Contact local PD. Get somebody out there fast. (computer dinging) Sir, county sheriff is already responding. There's reports of shots fired at that location. Send tactical backup as well. Whoa, Nelson, this operation is supposed to be... Off the books. I know. Keep it undercover. Call it a drug investigation. Actually, sir, I have Crystal on the line. Crystal, go ahead. They took him, sir. They took Martin. Gates : What happened? There was nothing at the motel. No, no. This was a setup, chief. 100% this was a setup. These guys came ready to rock and roll. This was all about grabbing Martin. What's their lead time? Crystal : Ten minutes, easy. And we're no closer to finding Cameron. This is messed up. This is seriously messed up. We need to get a ride. Tactical is on their way. Hold tight, Crystal. Copy that. Can I speak to you for a minute? (elevator bell dings) Sir, we need to issue a priority terror alert. Not yet. You're putting my agents in the line of fire without any support. I'll notify DHS. They can raise the national threat level. With all due, respect, sir... that's not good enough. We've lost Martin Odum. This is still a covert action. John Cameron remains our suspect. They need to find him and do it now. I need McGuire and Rice looking for Martin, not chasing some vague Intel. Not your call, Nelson. I will go to Director Bennett if I have to. We're too exposed here. Let's head back to the motel. That's the second time they tried grabbing him. Why is that? I don't know. This guy's been one fun-house mirror after another and you don't know? That's funny. He takes off to Houston, blows the place up. Then he comes back... and everybody just shrugs. Yeah, okay. Okay, well, I'll tell you what. I am done with this team-playing sh1t. Almost got killed, okay? I need to know what's going on. No more secrets. Who the hell is Martin Odum? (men shouting) (tires squealing) Martin : Who are you? Who are you? Verax. Where are you taking me? (helicopter blades whirring) (door squeaks shut) (helicopter blade whirring) (chains clinking) (gasps) Thirsty? (panting) 
 
 FBI did a hell of a job hiding you. I've been looking for you for ten years. We almost caught up with you in the hospital in Germany, but you slipped out. I'm guessing you had help. Who are you? I'm your wife. Your medical file said,  traumatic brain injury, severe memory loss. Some kind of dissociative fugue. Hell, there was so much chemical in the air, I'm not surprised. You probably don't remember me. Oh, yeah. I know who you are. Jason Shaw. Verax. I used to work for you in Iraq. Yes, you did. Till I found out you were a spy for MI6. Then I almost put a bullet in your head. Oh, you want another bite of the apple? Is that why I'm here? If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead. Where's Cameron? Where's the target? Let's go, fellas. Stay the hell away from me. Stay the hell away from me! (grunting) (Martin groaning) (groaning) What did you give me? (echoing): Huh? (sighs) Sodium thiopental. I need you to cooperate. This is about Iraq. You stole money. You covered it up. You killed American soldiers. Centcomm was pissing it away. Pacification funds, my ass. That money was funding the insurgency. (indistinct chatter) We made a calculated decision to repurpose those funds. The subterfuge wouldn't hold... (gunshot) ...if the soldiers had lived. Martin :  You murdered those soldiers. They were casualties of war. And they died with honor. Not like you. End of day, we took home almost a billion dollars in cash. You were there, too, Martin. You could have stopped it, but you didn't. You watched them die. I could tell it bothered you. Later, we caught you taking photos of the money. (groaning)  So, we beat the truth out of you. Tell me who you're working for. I work for you. For Verax. (grunting) Who are you? CIA, MI6? (panting) Defense intelligence? You're insane. (laughs) I've been helping you steal American dollars. (laughs) (grunting) (groaning) Go to hell. Shaw :  We finally broke you. You admitted  that you were MI6. And you were about to expose our biggest score. That we had Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. We found the WMD outside of Basra in a village that had been abandoned. Found more in the bunkers around the village. Sarin, anthrax, about 20 tons of weaponized agent. Yellow cake uranium. It was all there. Saddam's WMD. The ones that didn't exist. Yeah. And we had planned to keep it that way. What value was the WMD to you? Insurance, leverage. A means to check power. Or escalate the war? Isn't that what you wanted? War means profit. Chaos means profit. But it wasn't just about the money. Then what? This country's falling apart, Martin. Who's gonna save it? You? Power isn't free. It comes at a price. What about Operation Raining Fire? I actually have you to thank for that. We were getting ready to move it all when the bombs hit. Your pal Evans from the oil rig got you out. Man, they put a beat down on you, huh? What are you doing? Roughnecks got to watch out for each other. Come on, before they come back. You get out of here. As far as you can go. Shaw :  The night we were planning to move the weapons, you escaped. (touch tones beeping) Any allied air patrol, this is a priority fire mission. Please respond. Request immediate air strike. Eastern perimeter all clear. Perimeter all clear. We think he's still in camp. Heading westward now. Man : Unidentified operator, this is Echo One Actual. Please identify. Authorization Tango niner five zero. I repeat, Tango niner five zero. What is your position, Tango? (speaking indistinctly) Coordinates... 30.21 by 19.7. Tango, that's a friendly position. Request immediate air strike! I need everything you've got. Broken Arrow! Broken Arrow? Say again. That's a friendly position. If you don't listen to me, there's gonna be a hell of a lot more people dead! Kill the satcom. No communications outside of camp. I said again, a Broken Arrow. (grunts) (grunting) (grunts, panting) You're just a bunch of thieves. If you're gonna do it, do it. (gun chamber cocks) (airplane soaring) (explosions) (explosions) I called in the air-strike. (garbled radio transmission) (keyboard keys clacking) Operation Raining Fire was meant for an Iraqi military site 40 klicks north of us. You called Broken Arrow, brought them to us instead. Took courage to do what you did. You knew you'd probably die. I respect that sense of sacrifice. You killed a lot of my men that night. Came up one short. The bomb burned the shirt off my back. Most of my skin, too. Shock wave collapsed my left lung. You were safe in the hole. Getting blown off that hill saved my ass. I was one of the lucky ones. I guess Cameron got lucky, too. Man : Sir, we're ready. (beeping and trilling) Martin : What are you doing? Scanning a high-res image of your face. (beeping and chirping) Martin : You still haven't answered my question. Why am I here? (recording): You still haven't answered my question. Why am I here? The future of war is psyops. Strength through intelligence, out thinking your enemy. Controlling belief. (phone ringing) Man : Are we a go? Affirmative. I want sniper in position. Who's the target? Someone who can't seem to get with the program. Unfortunately, we have to deal with the situation. With an assassination? They'll catch you. Not if they're looking for John Cameron. You think John Cameron is some elusive operative? He's been in the shadows all this years because he  is  a shadow. I talked to him. You talked to me. It's the only way I could bring you in. You want to know who you are? (grunting) What's your name? Go to hell. Martin Odum? What's your name? Dante Auerbach? Try again. What's your name? I've told you. Len Barlow. (grunts) Cameron. John Cameron. Cameron was your legend in Iraq. You left it behind when the bombs fell. That's not possible. (gunshot) Shaw :  As far as the FBI's concerned, Cameron killed those soldiers after we took that cash. Martin :  That's not true. You did it. (clicks, gunshot) You murdered them. Man (over radio) : Adjusting the... 15 mile per hour crosswind. Target is in sight. I make the truth. I define belief. And moments from now, the Bureau is gonna believe you pulled the trigger  and killed Dayle Bennett, Director of the FBI. This is your homecoming. Welcome back, John. Take the shot. No! (grunts) Sir, Martin's cell phone has come back online. I'm sending his location to Rice and Crystal now. (distant siren wailing) Rice :  On our way. Eta : five minutes. (distant siren wailing) (metallic banging) Oh, my God. Sir, LAPD is responding to a shooting at the Federal Building in Westwood... that's right across the street from Martin's location. Alert Crystal and Rice. (distant siren wailing) (panting) It says Director Bennett's been shot. What? A sniper shot him through the window. (distant siren wailing) Put the gun down, Martin. I didn't fire it. Then who did? Shaw was here. How'd you find me? Your phone got turned on. We traced it. Of course. Just like he wanted you to. They set me up. Martin, put the gun down. You need to get out of here. Get Deputy Spiller on the line. (static crackling) Yes, sir. Gates : What's happening? I don't know. They're attacking our servers. (over speakers): My name is Martin Odum. My name used to be John Cameron. I'm a covert operative in the FBI. Tonight I claim responsibility for the killing of FBI Director Dayle Bennett. He was an enemy to his country. You'll call me crazy. You'll try to discredit me. But you'll not silence me. I pulled the trigger knowing what I was doing. I did it to stop us all from going over the cliff. Martin : Director Bennett was a traitor, a man bent on desecrating the Constitution. A man who ran a secret police, a political police, no different from the Stasi or the Cheka. A hypocrite who violated our liberty while hiding behind the flag and the Patriot Act. America must wake up. We now live... (knocking) in a Fascist state. Nelson. Gates : This video, I find it hard to believe. Fortunately, it was only sent to about a hundred senior Bureau personnel. That passes as good news? Well, the video was immediately classified. The situation is contained. I'm sure you'd agree the Bureau doesn't need a scandal compounding this tragedy. I'm sorry, who is that? I'm Conrad Tomlin. National Security Council. He's here to help us manage the crisis, Nelson. Meaning what? Coordinate the investigation. Help transition the leadership of the Bureau. Didn't realize the president already had someone in mind. Deputy Spiller's going to be the Acting Director. It's about stability. I have to know if I can count on you to bring Odum to justice. Martin Odum is not responsible for killing Director Bennett. That is not our position, Nelson. But it is mine. Tomlin : Well, perhaps you can explain to us how Odum escaped custody. If this turns into a scandal, someone is going to have to take the responsibility. Meaning me? I would see this as an opportunity to step up. Otherwise... ...you'll be stepping down. Crystal :  As explained in my report, Senator,  we have found no evidence directly linking Special Agent Odum to the assassination. Except for the, uh, videotaped confession he sent to his own superiors at the FBI 11 days ago. What else do you need, Agent McGuire? We believe the video has been coerced, if not a complete fabrication. That's, uh... that's bold conjecture. This-this was in your report. Yes, sir. So you're saying that the video's a fake. You think it was made without his cooperation? I, uh... (chuckles) I find that terribly hard to believe. We believe the technology has been developed... Special Agent McGuire, I'm gonna say this right now: I admire your loyalty to a fellow agent, but I need to remind you that you're under oath, sitting here. The fact remains that Martin Odum is troubled. He, uh... He failed five psych evaluations. He was deemed unstable, antagonistic and evasive. And yet, he was repeatedly put into the field as a deep cover operative. His own psychiatrist says, uh... Agent Odum may not be able to... "tell his legends from his own life." I think a more likely scenario is, uh... is that he snapped. The person in that video is not the agent that I knew and served with in the field, sir. I'm highly skeptical of that. Verax has employed robust  psyops operations since the Iraq War. I mean, they've invested My report includes detailed evidence of Verax's suspected involvement in Operation Raining Fire... Gorman : I don't see how a classified friendly fire report is any indication of a smoking gun. Verax and the U.S. military have tried to cover up the incident... And that sounds like a lot of conspiracy nonsense to me, Agent. I only wish it was. The Verax Corporation has served this country with honor and distinction. Jason Shaw is a patriot and a personal friend of mine. I'm not going to sit here and listen to you slander his good name in a weak attempt to exculpate Martin Odum, a man who has betrayed this country time and time again. I can only hope the FBI brings this fugitive  to justice. Didn't know if you could make it. Can't be too careful these days. How you doing? I'm all right. Just keeping my head down. Check the seat pocket. Did you reach out to MI6? (sniffs) My contact told me that they have no official knowledge of an agent named John Cameron. Unofficially, he told me "John Cameron" was a legend and that you've been disavowed. Fear of associating with a suspected terrorist. By now they've probably erased every trace of your time at MI6. But... we'll find another way. (chuckles darkly) Strange thing, not knowing your own name. Hey. Thanks for these. You see who they're going to make acting director? Spiller. Mm. I should've seen it coming. He served me up. He's an old pro. He had a price; we paid for it. DCO is officially closed. Does that mean you're out? Nah, I'm still in. They put me at a desk. Keeping me close, making sure I keep my mouth shut. Looks like I'm undercover now, too. Watch your step, Nelson. Martin... I'm here. When you need me, I'm here. Keep an eye on my family. I'll be in touch. Spiller :  I, Nicholas B. Spiller, do solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies, both foreign and domestic, and that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. I take this obligation freely, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter. So help me God. (applause) Crystal :  Sir, I took an oath to defend this country. I believe in the mission of the FBI. Today, that mission is being compromised due to certain elements within the Bureau that are more loyal to private interests than to public good. I stand by my statements. Gorman : Well, that's fine, Agent. I'd also like to go on record myself by stating that I fully support the closure of the Division of Covert Operations. Sir, the DCO has been instrumental in stopping dozens of attacks against this country. Except for the assassination of your own FBI's director. I would call that a notable failure, wouldn't you, Agent McGuire? This nation is faced by myriad threats, both from foreign agents and from evil traitors hiding within. As Acting Director of the FBI, my greatest responsibility to the American people is for their safety and security. And so my first and foremost priority will be to bring the assassin of my predecessor swiftly to justice. ♪ Grab your gloves ♪
