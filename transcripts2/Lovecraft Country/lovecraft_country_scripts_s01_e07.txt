 No, they were already dead. 
 I just... transformed their blood into a potion.

 - Ruby, it's okay. 
 You have been lying to me this entire time. 
 Nothing that has happened since I met William... sh1t, you... has been real. 
 What you know of William is true. 
 Captain Lancaster did try to kill him, and in fact he succeeded. 
 So this has... 
 this has been about revenge for your dead lover? 
 Yes. 
 I want revenge for William. 
 But I want so many other things too.

 Please. 
 My father was a leader in the Order of Ancient Dawn. 
 What the hell is that? 
 It's a group of powerful men who wield magic. 
 They don't allow women to join. 
 I begged my father to teach me anyway, but he refused. 
 I sought William out to seduce him into being my teacher, to prove I could be better than the son my father wished he had, but the more William taught me, the more I realized how silly it was to limit my pursuit of magic around impressing my father. 
 William's spell, which I completed, was the beginning of bigger ambitions. 
 I could be so much more. 
 Do things most people couldn't even imagine. 
 Like f*ck me. 
 As a man. 
 I never lied to you. 
 The words may have come out of William's mouth, but they were mine. 
 I wanna know everything. 
 Right now. 
 No more secrets, no more half-truths. 
 Every f*cking thing. 
 The whole truth involves lost pages from the Book of Names and your family.

 You been up here all night? 
 I translated about half the pages. 
 The ceremony at Ardham was complicated. 
 They had this symbol, written in chalk all over the lab, which makes me think it's important. 
 And then they had all these weird mechanical elements I-I've never seen before. 
 It's not as simple as just saying the words. 
 Titus and Samuel and that entire lodge spent decades studying this stuff, and they all died in failed attempts at casting these spells. 
 Not you. 
 Not Hanna. 
 She managed to escape the fire, ran right out the front door.

 Even though the house is burning around me. 
 How are we having the same dream? 
 I think Hanna might be trying to tell us something. 
 Warn us maybe. 
 But I can never hear her. 
 Could you? 
 She doesn't say anything in mine. 
 She's just standing in a doorway smiling with that book. 
 What book? 
 All the things to take when you're pregnant and running out of your master's burning house, and you stop to grab a... 
 The Book of Names. 
 No, it can't be. 
 If Hanna escaped with the book, wouldn't there be magic in your family? 
 I barely know anything about my mama's side. 
 She's the only one who survived the riots in Tulsa.

 Not long after Sherman went on to glory, Ethel's husband passed too. 
 It was hard, and we just didn't want to be two lonely widows anymore. 
 So one day Ethel said to me, "Bertie..." that's what she always called me... 
 said, "Hey, Bertie, I don't know what's left for two old gals like us, but this sure ain't it".

 Oh, wait.

 I've been trying to track it down. 
 I was wondering, did she tell you anything about it?
