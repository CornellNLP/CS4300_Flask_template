 MONTROSE FREEMAN: You wanna run chest first into some magical treasure hunt.   
 We already got one large gun ambush.   
 You won't tell them nothing, boy.   
 How you know there's    lodges?   
 LETI LEWIS: You really gonna let him chase his tale, looking for answers you already have?   
 ATTICUS FREEMAN: Leti's inheritance didn't come from her mother.   
 It came from you.    
 So, you want something in this house?    
 I just want Hiram's orrery.    
 [tires screeching]    
 LETI: The police captain was asking all these questions about the Winthrop Palace, like he had some sorta connection to it.    
 You come here and try and take my lodge's rightful property.    
 Forgive me. Did I miss your official initiation into the order?    
 WOMAN: Titus locked his pages in a booby-trap vault.    
 Imagine the possibilities if the pages were to be found?    
 I'm sorry.    
 HIPPOLYTA FREEMAN: For us, it's a rat race to the finish line.    
 And it's winner takes it all.    
 What if I told you that I could change your life, forever?
