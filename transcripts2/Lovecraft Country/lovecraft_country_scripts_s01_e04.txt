 Don't let the men fool you into thinking it's always about them.    
 His blood may have power in it, but that's only because Titus spelled it that way.    
 It doesn't make Tic special.    
 Not really.    
 Certainly not enough to get away with murder.

 And I don't want that.     
 Or this house.     
 I just want Hiram's orrery.     
 What the f*ck is an orrery?     
 It's a model of the solar system.     
 I believe Hiram's ghost kept it locked away somewhere inside.     
 Listen, you may have paid for this house, but my name is on the deed, so you can get the f*ck off my porch.     
 Call me if you find Hiram's orrery.     
 What galaxy could sustain two suns?     
 The Virgo Cluster?

 No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't pull the trigger.     
 The invulnerability, it's some spell her father cooked up.     
 So does that mean that he's still alive?     
 The rest of the Sons of Adam too?     
 No, he had to remove his invulnerability to cast the spell that ended up crumbling the lodge.

- [CHAIR SCRAPES]     
 What does this have to do with her?     
 She told me there's two sets of deciphered pages from the lost Book of Names still in existence.     
 Hiram kept his hidden from beyond the grave.     
 That's why she was asking me about his orrery.     
 Must be the key to finding his pages.     
 It's not in the house. I looked.

 You have his blood.
