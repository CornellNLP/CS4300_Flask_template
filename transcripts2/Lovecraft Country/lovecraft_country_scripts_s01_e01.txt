Starts with him running from Apaches and hiding in this magical cave, which transports him to the Red Planet. That's when it starts to get good. Hold on. You said the hero was a Confederate officer. Ex-Confederate. He fought for slavery. You don't get to put an "ex" in front of that. Stories are like people. Loving them doesn't make them perfect. You just try and cherish 'em,    overlook their flaws. Yeah, but the flaws are still there. Yeah, they are. But I love pulp stories. [chuckles] I love that the heroes get to go on adventures in other worlds, defy insurmountable odds, defeat the monster, save the day. Little Negro boy from the southside of Chicago don't notoriously to get to do that.  Unless they join the army.  - I didn't join for adventure. - Hmm.  I joined to get away from my father.

If he's watching, I think we should give him a show.  What has gotten into you?  You're only gonna be gone for a few days.  Used to be you couldn't wait to go on some grand adventure.

Arguably, the best ones.  - The best ones. - Mm-hmm.  And all of them based on your notes.  - Oh. [chuckles] - Now...  imagine how good they could get if I could take notes on my own.  Hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You know the road is a dangerous place for a woman traveling alone.  You know the sh1t I deal with out there.  It's dangerous out there, Hippolyta.  Where you going?

Something like that.  I'm surprised that one caught your interest.  Horror is usually my thing.  "On the Creation of Niggers." Now that's one of Lovecraft's we don't hear mentioned often.  Pops made me memorize that poem word for word after he caught me reading this.  Mm.  Thought it might turn me from the pulp trash I borrow from here to respectable literature.  He's been missing about two weeks.  About? You're not sure.  You know how he can get on the sauce.  I... I didn't think anything of it until his landlord dropped by when he didn't pay rent.  I don't know where he could've gone.  I might have an idea.  He wrote me.  About my mama.  [suspenseful music]  What, uh... wh... wh-what'd he say?  Said he found out where her family came from.  Wanted me to come home so I could go there with him.  He's still obsessing over her ancestry?  I thought he'd given all that up when she passed.  "I know that, like your mother, "you think that you can forget the past.  "You can't.  "The past is a living thing.  "You own it... owe it.  "Now I have found something "about your mother's forebearers.  "You have a sacred...  secret legacy, a birthright that's been kept from you." That's strange; that doesn't really even sound like your father.  I haven't even gotten to the strange part.  The place he wants me to go with him...  it's in Lovecraft Country.  Letter says Mom's ancestors are from Arkham, Massachusetts.  Home of the corpse reanimator and...  And Herbert West.  Lovecraft based it on Salem, but that's not real.  You sure?  Let me see the letter.  That's a "D." It's not Arkham with a "K." It's Ardham with a "D". That's a "D." ♪ ♪ You know, for someone who talked so much about the importance of being educated, you'd think Pop would learn how to write clearly.

I remember plenty of nights you dragging him off one of my barstools.  He hasn't been perched on one in weeks.  When's the last time you saw him?  'Bout two weeks ago.  Left here with some white man.  - Was he a cop? - Doubt it.  Looked like one of Bill Haley's Comets.  Can't get the clothes he was wearing on a pig's salary.  My guess, he's a lawyer.

Well, considering you were the only female member of the Southside Futurists Science Fiction Club.  I was. [laughs] I was.  I heard you were down in Florida hiding out.  How was it?  Segregated.  - Mm. - And you, where you been?  Mm, I've been a little bit everywhere.  Doing?  Everything.  Y'all ready to go?  - Wait, you coming with us? - Part way.  Marvin's working for the Springfield African American these days.  He's gonna look into that mysterious town of Ardham for us.  Why, thank you, baby. Are we checklist-ready?  Yep.

Good evening.   [laughter]   I, um... I find myself not for the first time   in, um...   the position of a kind of Jeremiah.   For example, I don't disagree with Mr. Burford   that the, um...   The inequality suffered by the American Negro   population of the United States   has hindered the American dream.   Indeed, it has.   I quarrel with some other things he has to say.   The other, deeper element   of a certain awkwardness I feel   has to do with, um...   it has to one's point of view; I had to put it that way.   One's, uh, one's sense, one's system of reality.   It would seem to me the proposition   before the House, when I put it that way,   is the American dream   at the expense of the American Negro,   or the American dream is at the expense   of the American Negro...   is a question hideously loaded,   and that one's response to that question   or one's reaction to that question,   has to depend on, in effect,   on where you find yourself in the world,   what your sense of reality is,   what your system of reality is.   That is, it depends on assumptions   which we hold so deeply   as to be scarcely aware of them.   A white South African or a Mississippi sharecropper   or a Mississippi sheriff   or a Frenchman driven out of Algeria,   all have, at bottom,   a system of reality which compels them to, for example,   in the case of the French exile from Algeria,   to defend French reasons from having ruled Algeria.   The Mississippi or the Alabama sheriff,   who really does believe, when he's facing   a Negro boy or girl, that this woman, this man,   this child must be insane to attack the system   to which he owes his entire identity.   And on the other hand...  There's a diner called Lydia's I got a tip on near here.  Won't take us too far off course to have lunch there.  What do you say to a detour?  - Where is it? - Simmonsville.  You know what that area be populated by on Diana's atlas?  - What? - Buncha trolls who pick their teeth with unwary motorists.  Funny. I need to add some entries to the guide.  I'm on a deadline.  Aren't you the publisher?  Exactly, which is why I know how much of a hard-ass I can be.

We'll seat ourselves, then.  [grunts]  Yes, that's what we'll do. Thank you.  Menu, please?  - What's good here? - Uh... uh...  Why don't we just start with some coffees?  Looks like the Simmonsville Dinette isn't making the guide.  Yeah, okay, but we're here now.  Doesn't mean we have to stay.  Get back in the car, we're, what, two, three hours from Marvin's?  We're here, damnit. We have every right to be.  We're citizens.  You're a veteran for God's sake.  Our money spends just as good as everyone else's.

Letitia f*cking Lewis.  [laughs]  It's getting late, Marvin.  Why don't you tell us what you discovered about our next stop?  Well, I heard a few tales about Devon County before, but once I started really digging in, it just kept getting stranger and stranger.  You see, the county seat, Bideford, is named after a town in England where they had one of the last witch trials.  They hung a woman for fornicating with the devil who appeared to her as a Negro man.  Y-you're saying that Bideford was founded by witches?  No, the witch hunters, and they don't like outsiders at all.  I found more than a few stories in our morgue about travelers being attacked in the surrounding woods.  - By what? - Grizzles, wolves.  Who knows?  There's been a bunch of missing person stories, too, some of which might be due to the current sheriff.  Eustice Hunt.  Ex-Marine.  This is his NAACP complaint file.  It's only a third of it.  Between the wild animals and this guy, I don't know who I'd rather run into.  Hmm.  What about Ardham?  It was settled around the same time as Bideford.  Local histories don't say by who.  That's what you dug up?  Yeah, I even tried calling the county record of deeds to get the property records.  No one answered.  But from what I could pull together...  Should be somewhere right around here.  That right there is the middle of nowhere with no guide stops.  What do you want to do?  We need to go to the registry.  Maps of the property line should clearly delineate a route in Ardham.  [ominous music]   Now, this is just the first issue,   but the plan is she'll be called to repair   faulty telescopes   or malfunctioning computers on different planets.  And guess what.

I can understand     you wanting to think that about her because you didn't have to live with her!  Hey, I went to Chicago every summer.  Oh, every summer! You got to come down here...  [sighs]  Ruby and I didn't have that option.  Well, you say that like it was my fault.  It's not sounding good.  Don't give me a f*cking lecture about Mama.  I've heard worse.  [arguing continues]  Been a part of worse.  - We're impossible? - Yes.  Pops tell you what happened last time I was home?  No.  Reporter came by.  Wanted to interview me on what it was like to be a Negro soldier.  Pops lost it.  Said it was bad enough I was throwing my life away for a country that hates me.  Now, I was gonna go inspire others to make the same stupid mistake.  I decided to give as good as I got for once.  Still see the cracks in the plaster where we slammed into the wall.

He'd stay till   :  ,   :  , midnight, if that's what it took, waiting for me to bring up the subject of you.  Drove Hippolyta crazy.  Course it did.  Just another example of how hardheaded he was.  Montrose has done the best he can.  He didn't have it easy with our father.  Why are you always defending him?  You grew up in the same house. You came out just fine.  Your pops was...  Was what?  What?  He was younger.  He was smaller. He took the brunt of it.  I should've protected him more. I always regret that.  I was younger and smaller, too.  You ain't do sh1t to protect me. You regret that?  [glass breaks]  God damn it! Look at what you made me do!  Atticus.  - It's family business. - Let go of my arm.  - You're hurting me. - It's not ours.  Go!

There's no damn road.  Letitia, you done seen something?  - Nah, I ain't seen... - Stop the car.  Stop the car. I'll get out and look.
