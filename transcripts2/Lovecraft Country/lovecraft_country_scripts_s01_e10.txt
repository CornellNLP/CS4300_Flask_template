 I ran from Master's house until I couldn't run no more, but I knew there was nowhere I could go where we'd be safe.    
 My child would have Master's blood and would always be seen as a source of power to those in the Order.

 Hanna unknowingly birthed this ancestral space the night she first opened the Book of Names.    
 There was so much she didn't understand about magic then.    
 She believed that this was hell; she was being punished for using the devil's tools.    
 Every night, when I closed my eyes,  I found myself back here, burning over and over again.    
 The pain was unbearable.    
 I had to make it stop, but the flames I ran through to escape followed me, even in death.    
 Before Hanna took her own life,  she dared to open the book once more...    
 To find the spell that would bind it shut forever so that the suffering it caused would not be visited on those who came after.     
 Took a long time to understand the fire was my rage made manifest, that it could be tamed.     
 Once I did, once I made this a safe place for our ancestors...     
 I realized this magic was not something to be feared... but a gift to pass on.
