 Woman : Every day you do nothing but make choices. 
 Is the person you say you want to be the person you're choosing to be? 
 Letty : If you saw somebody on the side of the road, would you pull over and help? 
 Christian : Did you see somebody who needed help? 
 Maybe. 
 Did you help them? 
 I'm Letty. 
 Javier. 
 Cheers. 
 There's a man coming here to kill you. 
 You're not an English teacher. 
 Hey, Christian, don't get mad, but I'm about to do a swan dive off the back of a wagon. 
 How much of my money did you destroy yourself with, huh? 
 I am sorry, Letty... but you work for me now. 
 [Birdsong, distorted voices] 
 [Thumping] 
 Woman :  Hey, you. Today is the day. Let's say these words together... I am aware, I am alive, I am a... 
 [Thumping] 
 No, please. What's happening? 
 Just tell me what's happening. 
 Get something nice to wear from your sh1t in the back, hmm? 
 What sh1t? 
 Everything you own is right behind you in the trunk. 
 How did you... 
 Where are we? 
 You can change in the bathroom, hmm? 
 How long was I out? 
 Almost two days. 
 Are we back in North Carolina? 
 Get changed. 
 I need to be in North Carolina. 
 Get changed. 
 Oh, I feel like sh1t. 
 You look like sh1t. 
 [Urinating] 
 [Grunts] 
 You're wearing the same clothes. 
 I told you to change.

 Drinks. 
 Nurse Javier. 
 You need to replenish your system. 
 I need to smoke a bowl. 
 Put some more makeup on. 
 Not until you tell me why. 
 If this is rehab, I'm gonna kill myself. 
 Javier : It's not rehab. Just play along. 
 Man : Mr. and Mrs. Diaz, welcome to The Inn at Trousdale Farm. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Sir. 
 Breathtaking. 
 I have several regular guests who request it every year. 
 May I offer you a morning newspaper? 
 The New York Times. 
 Thank you. 
 Hi, Thomas. 
 I'm Jacqueline. 
 Hi. 
 And I'd like that, too... 
 The New York Times  in my own room, please. 
 Forgive me. 
 I assumed you were Mrs. Diaz. 
 Oh, I'm Mrs. Diaz, all right. 
 But Mrs. Diaz and Mr. Diaz had a little argument in the car. 
 I won't bore you with the details. 
 Um... 
 I'm so sorry, but, uh, we only have 18 rooms, and we are fully booked for the duration of your stay. 
 Which is how long, exactly? 
 Two nights. 
 Two nights too long, right? 
 Well, the, um, Terrace Suite is very spacious. 
 Well, I hope so. 
 Only the best for Mrs. Diaz. 
 Here you are, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Enjoy your stay. 
 [Chimes play, safe lock engages] 
 Is the minibar in there? 
 No. 
 Then there's no minibar. 
 I know. I told them to remove it. 
 So this is rehab. 
 If you say so. 
 I'm not your f*cking prisoner! 
 You will get us kicked out. 
 Oh, you're quick. 
 I don't care what you remember and what got flushed down the toilet with the rest of your junkie sh1t. 
 You took $50,000 from me, so, yes, you are my prisoner. 
 There's still the $18,000 in my bag. 
 Why don't you just take it and let me go? 
 Because you're obviously worth more to me than $18,000. 
 Why? 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 That's mine. Can I answer it? 
 No. 
 You will do only what I tell you to do, nothing more. 
 What do you need me for? 
 I need you to be my wife. 
 Oh, I thought you'd never ask. 
 ...for as long as we're in this hotel. 
 And you can't just sit in this room and do nothing. 
 You have to make some friends. 
 Do I tell them about my abusive husband? 
 Where are you going? 
 Outside. 
 I have to return this call. 
 Who? 
 My French lover. Huge cock. 
 Who? 
 My parole officer, okay? 
 I missed a check-in. 
 I don't know what we're doing here, but I assume you don't want anyone to come looking for me. 
 No one will find you here. 
 Well, I'll just make sure of that. 
 If someone does find you here, you will be very f*cking sorry, hmm? 
 As sorry as you will be if I find you somewhere else. 
 You'll cover for me, right? 
 Christian :  Absolutely not. You already missed one check-in. 
 Did you report me? Yes. No, you didn't. No, I didn't, 'cause I thought you might be dead. Remember the message you left me? Yes. So, you can understand how I could think you might be dead. Yes. I'm very glad that you're not. I need to see you in person. You know that. Where are you? Look, I really don't know. Letty, you'd better be in this state. Where are you? I'm fine. You're not fine. You're in trouble. You know, this does not point you  in the direction of getting your son back. I know. You need to come see me, or I need to come see you. I know, and I'm sorry, but neither of those things can happen right now. I'm begging for you to cover for me. And I am begging you to show up for your next check-in... Monday at 11:30 a.m. You have two days. My next check-in isn't until Wednesday. I just moved it up. I'll try. No, you'll just be here. Woman : They did such a good job on your hair. Woman #2 : Thank you. You are so sweet. I'm actually kind of surprised. I know. I know. She's my new go-to. So, have you decided on the trip? Yes. So, you know how we were going back and forth between Bora Bora and Fiji? Yeah. So, finally I was just like, "Bora Bora's closer." The Four Seasons? Yes. Ah, it is the best. I know. Oh, I forgot you went. Yeah. Just don't take the kids 'cause it's two flights and a boat. I know, but, you know, they didn't go on this trip, and then it'll be Christmas. Okay, so take the kids. I mean, you can afford it. Well, Barrett got in to Dalton! Ahh! Oh, my God! Oh, sh1t! Good Lord! Are you okay? Let me get you a towel. Let me look. Is it wet? It's, like, wet. Oh, my gosh, it looks so... I can't even see. Are you... It's fine. Are you Robin? Yeah. I'm sorry. I found your wallet on the ground, and I must have spilled the drink when I leaned down to pick it up. Oh, I didn't even realize I had dropped it. Thank you. Of course. Just when you think everyone's out to rip you off, right? Thank you. You're an angel. I ruined your dress. Oh, no, no, no, it's fine. It's vodka. And a spritz of olive juice. That's how I order mine. It's the only way. Oh, my... Can you get her another one, please? Oh, no, I really shouldn't be drinking. Oh, are you maybe pregnant? No. I'm just... Oh, then bring her another one. Us too. Sure. Yeah. Bartender : Right away. This is Heidi. Hi. And I'm... Robin. Oh, right, of course. You knew that. What's your name? Jacqueline Diaz. Is that your husband? Uh-huh. Oh, sh1t, he is gorgeous. Ooh. He's actually talking to my husband. He's the fat one with bad posture on the left. He is not fat, Robin. Whatever. You know what? We'll go talk to them in a minute, but not yet. I think we're more interesting. I am so glad you spilled your drink on us. Me too. Here's to new friends. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. So, um, do you have kids or do you work? I'm a writer. Oh. No way. Really? Novels or...? Yeah. Oh, w... That is... Wow. I am so jealous. So, would maybe we have read anything you've written or... Um, maybe. Have you read "The Girl on the Train"? Seriously? I-I thought the author was Paula. Oh... Yeah. Paula Hawkins. Is that your pen name? Oh, my God. No, no, no. I'm the ghostwriter. You see, Paula wrote the first half of the book and sent it straight to the publishers. Oh, no, I think I read something about that. Yeah. It's not a secret. Mm-hmm. But sending half a book when you're pretty much unknown is a risky move. Mm. But there was this huge bidding war, and Paula sold it for a ton of money. But then she couldn't figure out the rest of the story, so I did. Holy... Oh, my God. ...sh1t. ♪ Is someone listening? ♪

♪ But I'm gonna leave you far behind ♪ Got to admit, that was kind of fun. Javier : Vacation is supposed to be fun. "Do you have kids? Do you work?" You worked your ass off. You wrote "The Girl on the Train." Only the second half. Can you believe they believed that? I believed your Ryan Gosling bullshit. You totally did. You're very good. Yeah, well, this is my present to myself. You can't keep that. It's mine now. You know, you could be someone who owns that necklace. What? You could be one of those women down there. Why aren't you? I don't want to be one of those women. I just want this necklace. Anyway, there's a five-star hotel with 18 rooms. If one necklace is stolen, the whole place becomes a crime scene, so... They'll blame the maid. Just take it to the front desk. Say you found it. I already  found  a wallet. What? Robin... Bill's wife. I took it for fun so I wouldn't drink. For five seconds. She ordered me a martini as a thank you. Why give the wallet back? It was ugly. This is really pretty. And I look so much more like Mrs. Diaz. Isn't that who you want me to be? I promise I won't wear it outside the bedroom. Well, you do look beautiful. Thank you. Even more beautiful than the day we met. I can't believe it's been 10 years. Mm-hmm. Madrid. The Palace Hotel. Can you remember what I was wearing? Uh... I remember everything about your face. I was there with that prince. No. I was the prince. Right. I was there with that blond boy... Uh-huh. The heir to the cruise line. Uh-huh. He was convinced he would marry me, but he spent the whole night talking to some Romanian slut with four names. So I spent the whole night at the champagne fountain. I was there so long, somebody asked if I worked there, and... And it was me. You were in that tuxedo, and you said... "Do you work here?" "Do I look like I work here?" "I can't imagine someone so beautiful could be here all alone." And I said... You said... "I'm alone," and you said... "So am I." Happy anniversary, baby. I need you to spend more time with Robin tomorrow, away from her husband. Why? Because I said so. What are you doing with her husband? What do you think? Oh, my God. No. No. No, don't stop. Don't stop. I'm not killing anybody. I'm not asking you to. Take it to the front desk. Lost and found. It's not lost. It's mine. Take it the front desk. Now. Thomas : Looking for your car, Mrs. Diaz? Anything I can do for you? I, uh, found this on the floor upstairs. I don't know who it belongs to. Oh, my. Right? I almost thought about stealing it. [Chuckles] We'll find the rightful owner. Thank you, Thomas. Good night. Good night, Mrs. Diaz. Oh! I scared you? No, I just... I wasn't sure if you were in the room. I am in the room. [Chimes playing] I gave the necklace to Thomas. Who? The manager. Oh. The handsome one. Of course you did. He says to say hi. No, he didn't say that. Yes. Yes, he did. Okay. Hi, Thomas. [Water running] [Indistinct conversation and laughter] Jacqueline! Hey. Heidi has a prescription. Come and have a hit. Please. Come on. Yeah, just take it from... You know what? You just hold that in. That's what you do. Just... Oh. Oh, respect. Ooh. It's called "satina." Sativa. What? No. Heidi, I don't think that's it. That sounds weird to me. No. Okay. Shut up. It's sativa and indica. Isn't that what Heidi Klum named her baby? Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh. Thanks, guys. Thanks. No, no, no. Where are you going? You can't go. My husband and I had a fight. It's fine. Oh, no! I'm so sorry. Aw, that's terrible. Are you okay? Yeah. I just really have to leave. No, no, no, you shouldn't have to leave. You should stay. I know. Bill, could she stay with us in our room? Wouldn't that be so fun? I don't know that she would want... Oh, I know. Heidi has two queen beds. You could stay in her... We could do like a girls' night. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! I mean... No, I really have to go. Well, you're not gonna drive after smoking weed. I'm fine. I'm fine. No, no, look, I really don't think that's a good idea. I really don't think you're the one that should be telling her that, Bill, do you? There you are. Oh. Oh. I'm so glad you didn't leave. 
 
 Hey, Alejandro. Hi. Hey. We were just saying that Jacqueline could stay with Heidi if she needed to. I didn't agree to that. Well... Well, thank you, but I don't really think that will be necessary. At least, I hope not? It's not necessary. It's not necessary. Oh, okay. Good. Good! I'm so glad you're staying. I would be so sad if you left. Look, we're gonna go up to bed, but we should still do that girls thing, the three of us. Ooh, yeah. Tomorrow? I heard about this amazing hike, like, through, what, a meadow or something? What did I read? Or maybe we'll just drink. Yes. Yes. No boys allowed? Come on. That's why it's called a girls thing, Bill. Hey, Bill, do you play golf? Uh, yeah, I'm not bad. Whatever. He's really good, actually. Why don't we play nine holes tomorrow, huh? Mm. If we can get a tee time, that would be great. For $1,200 a night, I think anything is possible. Yeah! I like you. Okay. Mm. Here. Take a hit. I'm good. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Bye. Night. Night-night. Letty : You're on your own. You should chew your food before you swallow. I got a tee time at 4:05. That's pretty late. You won't have time to play the whole course before the sun goes down. Right. You don't have to kill him. I do. It's my job. Uh-huh. That's it? It's your job? To kill people? You don't care? I care. Oh. Good. That's a relief. I guess he deserves it then. If it wasn't me, it would be someone else. Wouldn't be me. I'm not killing anyone. Ever. Ever, ever, ever. Didn't say you were. I just need you to keep his wife occupied while we're out. That's all you have to do. What would you do if I wasn't here? Jerk off. Oh, I'm not having s*x with you again. Ever. I don't understand this. You'd have killed this guy with or without me, so... You are here because it would be very strange for me to be at this hotel without my wife. So, you'd have had some other wife? Or a husband. Are you really from Madrid? Buenos Aires. Trash bags, gloves... the kind that... I know which kind you like. More Pedialyte. I'm fine. Gummy bears.

Change? [Sighs] Well, thank you, honey. I bet you've never said that to a woman and meant it. Javier : I'll be back in a couple of hours, and it will be done. Letty, if you try to leave... I will find you. Yeah, I get it. You know how to train a dog. [Door opens, closes] [Exhales heavily] Ugh, f*ck it. Whoa. Hell of a swing. Yeah. I used to be better before I popped my shoulder out a couple years ago. Mm-hmm. I won't tell you how. Okay. Way too embarrassing. Okay. Tubing. You know tubing? It's like water-skiing, but you're in a big float. I know what it is. I swear, this loser kid running the boat was trying to kill me or something. I mean, I'm there holding on, gripped tight as sh1t, but he guns that boat and whips to the left and... wham! And my shoulder's like... bam! I'll tell you what... that was the worst pain I have experienced in my life. Really? And I'll tell you what else... I have never been so glad to be wearing a life vest. [Whistles] Wow. That right there might be the new worst pain of my life. You've had a pretty lucky life, Bill. You met Alejandro in a palace? In Madrid, yeah. Total fairy tale. Of course, I didn't know it then. I was so drunk on champagne. Oh, my God, I cannot do champagne. I had one crazy night in college, and now the smell of it just... That's Jack Daniel's for me. That's tequila for me. Uh, yeah, I know. Okay, you don't have to act like it was yesterday. It was 15 years ago. Exactly. I was 23, so... Uh, you were 25, so... It was... It was at my wedding, and Heidi had, like, 87 shots of tequila... Oh, please don't tell the story. It's not exciting. It's about a girl who gets drunk at a wedding. Uh, it's a little bit more than that. Okay, you know what? I'm out. Heidi, it's funny! It's fine. I'm tired, and I don't want to sit here while you guys talk about your husbands and your drunk, single friend Heidi. Heidi, no, it's not like that. I'm gonna go watch "The Bachelor." Mnh. She's so lucky. What do you mean? Nothing. Never mind. You know, she can... walk away whenever she wants to. There's nothing stopping her. She could just leave this hotel if she felt like it. Why can't you? Same reason you can't... because we are trapped with our husbands. Wow. They have more. [Both laugh] Please, two more. Server : You got it. Quickly. [Both laugh] You know, I don't think it went in the water. I heard the splash. Well, you'd have to have very good ears to hear that from the tee box. I have very good ears. All right, I-I'll hit a provisional, but this is bullshit. You will catch up. Yeah. [Laughing] I'm not counting. Thank you. Great! Whoo-hoo! Oh, trade you. Yeah. Trade you. [Laughs] But... I was just saying, I don't want to rain on your parade, Jacqueline. No. 10 years is amazing. It is. So, happy anniversary. You win with 15. Well, 14. If we make it to 15, I'll let you know. [Band playing light jazz] Oh, my God, I love this song. You know it? "Blue Skies"? Mnh-mnh. ♪ Blue skies, smilin' at me ♪ You have a great voice. I know, right? Yeah. ♪ Blue skies do I see ♪ Whoo! f*ck it, I'm getting up there. And after that double-bogey shitshow on 4, I'm gonna need at least two more holes to catch up. No one will know the score. What do you mean? I mean, you and I... we can keep a secret, right? You're a funny guy. Thank you. No, I... I don't mean funny in a "ha-ha" way. In a sort of a... Anyway. Do you know what today is? Yeah. It's Sunday. And? And... nothing. Come on, let's go, please. You know what today is, Bill. Who are you? I know you remember a boy named Charlie. I am... I don't know what you're talking about. I'll remind you. He was 8 years old. It was a Saturday afternoon, half a mile from their house in St. Louis. Mom and Dad took Charlie to Forest Park for a picnic, and they walked to Charlie's favorite ice cream place... Homer's. Charlie got his favorite... a bubblegum milkshake. I'm not listening to this. You  are  listening to this. Charlie's parents instructed me to say these words to you. As they crossed Lindell Boulevard, Mom and Dad didn't notice that Charlie had stopped to pet a dog. The dog was also named Charlie. Actually, that's a nice touch, but... When they noticed that Charlie... their Charlie... wasn't with them, their heart stopped. The light had just changed, and cars were about to zoom through the crosswalk. But when they turned around, Charlie was patiently waiting at the other side... because he knew the rules. Red hand... stop. Man walking... go. I don't want to hear anymore. They want you to hear everything. The signal changed, "Go," said the walking man. So Charlie ran to his parents. And you gunned it through that red light... at 70 miles an hour to go wherever the hell you were going. And you killed Charlie. No. It was an accident. Yeah. Accidents happen. But this was different. No, it wasn't. This was different. In an accident, the right thing for a person to do is to stop and take responsibility for what they did, especially if they killed another human being, especially if they killed a child. I want to talk to a lawyer. I want to talk... You should've done that a long time ago, Bill. So now you're talking to me. ♪ Blue days, all of them gone ♪ Not for her! ♪ Nothing but blue skies from now on ♪ [Laughter] Charlie's parents looked for this monster who took their child from them, who ruined their lives eight years ago today. And they don't want to endure the thought of you living one day longer than their son was on this earth. I'm really sorry. I really am. That's what people always say in these moments. But it isn't true, Bill. What you really are is scared. Don't be. It will be quick. What? You're gonna have a heart attack. Shh, shh, shh, shh. So no one will ever know the truth. You don't get the dignity of the truth. Only Charlie's parents will know. And me. And you. Don't try to run. Can we go a little faster? [Band increases tempo] Yes. ♪ Blue skies smilin' at me ♪

The first words you used to describe him were "fat" and "uninteresting." You have some dude's number in your wallet. That is this college kid from the car wash. I've kept it for three years. sh1t. I know. I know. I know. I'm ridiculous. Completely. You're fantasizing about walking out of the hotel, running away, instead of just doing it. I can't. Listen, don't cry. I-I'm just... No. I mean, you're right, obviously, but... I can't. Why not? I can't talk about it. Yes, you can. You're just choosing not to. I mean I'm not  allowed  to talk about it. Says who? Says Bill. Eight years ago, he ran over a little boy and he killed him. What? And... And I was in the passenger seat. Bill made me swear that I would never tell anyone, and I haven't. I'm horrible. So, every year, on the anniversary, we take a trip, you know, just pretend like it didn't happen. And I just thought it would eventually go away, but it just doesn't. We just get more and more... horrible to each other. I hate him. That's marriage, right? That's two people who make each other their ugliest selves. We deserve it. Why am I telling you this? Because you're finally done. What? Let's go. What? Right now. Let's get out of here. Well, we can't just leave. That's exactly what we need to do. We might be trapped, but we're not handcuffed. Let's go. Oh, my God. Can we? They'll be back soon, and we'll be gone. Okay. Holy sh1t. Do you have a car? Yes. Go upstairs to your room, grab only what you absolutely need, and meet me where we smoked last night, okay? Okay. Don't run. Okay. [Rattling] Oh, my God, Robin. What? You said grab... Come on. Let's go. Do you have your own key to the car? I can't believe we're doing this. Do you have your own key? Yes. It's in my purse. It's right this way. It's the... It's the Tesla. Unlock it. Unlock it! No. It opens automatically when you walk up to it, it just knows. How does it know to pop the trunk? I think you have to press a button on the key. Then pull out the key. sh1t. Oh, all this stupid sh1t in here! I can't see! Ha! Found it! Keep your voice down. What is it? Who is that? Wait, Robin. Who is that? Bill? Robin, wait. Bill? Wait. Robin. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ahh! [Sobs, gags] Do not throw up. Do not put your DNA all over the parking lot. I didn't see anything! I won't tell anyone! Stop! Stop! I promise! No! Just let me go! Shh. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I told you not to run, okay? Don't answer me. Don't cry. Don't shout. Don't scream, okay? Okay. I am not going to kill you, okay? Okay. Okay. I didn't tell anyone. You still haven't, okay? Okay. Okay? Is she dead? Yes, she is dead. Stay... Don't you move. We have to put the bodies in the trunk, okay? I'm... We're taking their car? They're no longer staying at this hotel. Let's go back inside. What? We have to get our things. I have my things. I have to get my things. And we have to check out like normal people in the morning. What? No. I can't stay there. I can't. I'm telling you what to do if you don't want to go back to prison for the rest of your life. Okay? Okay. When the police start asking questions, they will have a very clear timeline of when Robin and Bill were last seen, which cannot be the same time you and I were last seen. Do you understand? Yeah. Okay. We put them out of their misery. Don't you think? Who puts us out of our misery? Would you like something to help you sleep? Yes. [Safe chiming] You're all set, sir. Thank you, sir. [Engine starts] We're just gonna leave them in the parking lot? No. Javier : They're over there. Letty : You walked all the way back to the hotel from here? Yeah. It was an hour, maybe a little more. Now what? We have two cars. This one is due back to the airport in Knoxville, hmm? I'll take this one. No, no, no, no. I'll drive this one. You drive that one. Follow me.
