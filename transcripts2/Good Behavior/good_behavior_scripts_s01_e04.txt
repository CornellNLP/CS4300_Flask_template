 I'm Letty. 
 Javier. 
 Cheers. 
 [Moans] 
 There's a man coming here to kill you. 
 You have a shotgun pointed at your back. 
 I want to see Jacob. 
 You're violating your restraining order just standing there. 
 What are you doing? 
 Call it an advance. 
 No! 
 You work for me now. 
 I saved your life! 
 Thank you, my prince. 
 I'm so glad to be alive right now with a murderer, two dead bodies, and no way out. 
 I can't thank you enough for rescuing me. 
 Javier : He looks like you. 
 I want to get him back. 
 I think you can. 
 If you stop screwing up. 
 I'm trying. 
 Try harder. 
 You really are a stalker. You know that. 
 Now I've covered for you twice. 
 [Through cellphone] I don't know where you are, but you will be in my office tomorrow. 
 I don't have your phone number. 
 I'm not giving you my phone number. 
 [Doorbells jingle] 
 [Country music playing softly through speaker] 
 [Plates rattling] 
 [Plate scraping] 
 Javier : I can drive you to Asheville. 
 Letty : I know you can. 
 I'll... I'll just put it in your phone, okay? 
 So if you get into trouble... 
 You're not touching my phone. 
 You can write it down. 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't... I don't have any paper. 
 [Insects chirping] 
 Do I have to keep worrying? 
 About our road trip? 
 About  you. 
 I told you. We're good. 
 Good.

 Really? 
 Thought I'd try. 
 Don't try. 
 I'm gonna make a suggestion. 
 Okay. 
 How about you stop being such an asshole? 
 Sure. 
 I'll put it on my to-do list right under "join the gym." 
 Don't do that. 
 Don't pretend like you don't care. 
 You're so used to disappointing people, it doesn't affect you anymore, but disappointing people and being an asshole are two different things. 
 So uplifting, always. 
 Thank you. I get that a lot. 
 I'm fine. 
 I didn't do anything wrong. 
 I'm sorry for being an asshole. 
 I'm trying to do better. 
 I got stuck in a bad situation and I got myself out of it. 
 A situation with a guy who didn't let you use, you said. 
 I did. 
 Sounds like a really bad situation. 
 It was. We're no good for each other. 
 Letty. 
 Christian. 
 Being connected to other human beings is important. 
 You need people in your life who care about you, who you care about. 
 I'm going to my high-school reunion. 
 You didn't graduate high school. 
 And I got the Facebook invitation anyway. 
 This wouldn't happen to be about your son, would it? 
 No. 
 You know you can't go anywhere near him, Letty. 
 I'm not going near him. 
 I'm going to my high-school reunion Saturday night to make some human connections. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What about getting a job? 
 Yes, I want to get a job, a normal place to live... all the things. 
 Good. 
 That's what everybody keeps telling me. 
 And, uh... you went to high school where, exactly? 
 Danville High. 
 It's within state lines, but it's kind of far away. 
 So, I guess that means that you'll be missing your check-in on Saturday. 
 I can do Monday or Tuesday. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I want photographic evidence of you at this high-school reunion. 
 Oh, I will selfie up a storm.

 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Well, well. Freedom looks good on you. 
 Did you put your face all over the car before or after you got it bulletproofed? 
 Nice bag. 
 Wait, don't tell me... Chinatown. 
 Did you get your tramp stamp removed, or is that J.Crew number just thick enough to cover it up? 
 It's cashmere. 
 It's nice. 
 Get in. 
 It is so good to see you. It really is. 
 It is good to see  you. 
 The real-estate thing seems like it's working out. 
 God, it's booming. 
 I've already sold three houses so far this month. 
 Don't tell him I told you, but I'm making more than Kyle now. 
 Work! [Laughs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Exhales] Let's go get a drink. 
 I want to hear everything. 
 I don't drink. 
 What? 
 On weekdays. I don't drink on weekdays. 
 Right, me neither. 
 Anyway, we're having a barbecue at the house later tonight for the reunion-planning committee. 
 It's a stupid final-meeting thing. 
 It's at 6:00. 
 I love that you're on the planning committee. 
 I love that you're coming to the reunion. 
 How many points do I get for using a high-school reunion as an alibi? 
 10. [Chuckles] 
 10? At least 100. 
 10 out of 10. 
 10 is... ultimately, 10 is a low number. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, aren't you supposed to, like, never drink? 
 Yeah. 
 So boring. 
 Yeah, but I mean, if you're really gonna try to come back here and start over, try to get Jacob, which I think is a great plan, by the way... 
 And Kyle is totally down to help you with all the legal stuff. 
 But, I mean, you know, you probably should never drink. 
 Probably not. 
 So, how's it work with Jacob, exactly? 
 You can't come within how far of him? 
 1,000 feet. 
 How are you supposed to know how far 1,000 feet is? 
 I don't know. 
 How is that different from 500 feet? 
 I mean, you're not even really near the child at 100 feet. 
 Some people can't help but do damage, even at 100 feet. 
 What damage are you gonna do at 100 feet? 
 [Scoffs] I don't know. 
 Well, I think 1,000 feet is excessive, but you probably should wait in the car. 
 For what? 
 We're picking up Autumn and Dax. 
 Jacob goes to the same school. 
 Just got to run in and sign this stupid permission-slip thing for Dax. 
 Woman : What the hell? 
 1,000 feet. I'm just here with Tiffany. 
 She's picking up her kids. 
 As soon as the bell rings, I'll get in the car. 
 The windows are tinted. Jacob won't even see me. 
 You're just here with Tiffany Dash Real Estate? 
 I'm staying with her. 
 Why? 
 Our class reunion is this weekend. 
 [Laughing] Oh, my God. 
 Truth. 
 Trying to make a normal life, Mom. 
 Get a job, get my own place. 
 Tiffany's gonna help me look for something. 
 Happy house hunt. 
 Are you gonna say anything about the money I left? 
 What money? 
 In the mailbox. 
 What? 
 I left $20,000 in the mailbox. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 For Jacob. Are you serious? 
 Why would you leave that much money in a mailbox, Letty? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, you're such a bitch. 
 It was very generous of you. 
 Jacob has a new wardrobe and $19,000 in a college fund. 
 He has a college fund? 
 Yeah, he does now. 
 [School bell rings] 
 Why don't you just get back in Tiffany's limo or whatever that is?

 Hey, Tiffany said you might be able to help me out with Jacob. 
 Yeah. I'll do everything I can, obviously. 
 You need to be able to show that you have a job. 
 I know that for sure. 
 I have an interview at a temp agency tomorrow.

 Would you describe yourself as a self-starter? 
 Definitely. 
 I, uh, worked in a library for six months. 
 They have this old-school card-catalogue situation, and it was always impossible to find books, so I invented a better system. 
 No one even asked me to. 
 And where was this library? 
 Virginia. 
 In prison? 
 You had to know I'd run a background check. 
 I mean, I hoped you would. 
 What kind of temp agency would you be running if you didn't? 
 Well, you are obviously very qualified to be a waitress.

 Thank you. 
 The hell have you been? 
 Oh. Hey. [Chuckles] 
 I was, um... working late. 
 Yeah. I used to use that line, too. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Tiffany found your fine china. 
 Don't worry. I pretended it was mine. 
 I don't know what the hell you're talking about. 
 Okay. Here's what's going to happen. 
 You're gonna follow me, and we'll find a place and have a little chat. 
 If you don't follow me, I will get on the deejay mike and tell this entire room just how fine your china is. 
 You know I will.

 Thanks for that. 
 I'm giving you the chance, dude, to not mess it up like I did. 
 I care about you, but I care about Tiffany more. 
 And I swear to God, if you don't get help immediately, I will tell her everything. 
 I will not let you destroy her life. 
 But you threw it out. You... you covered for me. 
 Because I don't want to watch her world fall to pieces. 
 My God, do you even see how good she is? 
 Everything she's done for you? 
 It happens so fast, Kyle. 
 I am living, breathing proof... barely breathing proof. 
 One minute, you're working late, the next minute, your kid is taken away from you. 
 Yeah, your case. 
 What? 
 Um... my friend, he... 
 What did he say? 
 He said you're f*cked...

 Whore. 
 Tiffany, I am so sorry. 
 It is not my fault that you turned out this way. 
 I never said it was. 
 I tried to help you, you f*cking ungrateful bitch. 
 All I did was introduce you to Sean 'cause you like black guys. 
 How was I supposed to know that he was gonna turn out to be some meth-head porn-star freak who was... 
 You don't need to... 
 I don't feel guilty for anything! 
 Tiff, calm down. 
 You stay out of this! 
 All I asked you to do was one thing. 
 I asked you for one thing. 
 I didn't ask you for anything more because I know better. 
 All I asked you to do was not f*ck my husband. 
 I didn't f*ck your husband. 
 Why? Why her? 
 Why him? 
 Tiff, what you saw was not... 
 I am not an idiot! 
 All you do is hurt people. 
 That is all that you are capable of. 
 You don't belong in the world of normal people.

 I hope that you never get Jacob back. 
 I hope that you O.D. somewhere and die. 
 Why don't you just kill yourself?

 Well, try harder. Nobody likes a quitter.
