 I want to see Jacob. 
 You're violating your restraining order just standing there. 
 I have this thing going with my mom. 
 I give her $1,000, and she lets me spend a day with him. 
 This isn't my dad. I know he didn't die in the war. 
 How'd you know that? 
 You're not sad about him. 
 Letty-Betty-bo-Betty! Mm! 
 Rob McDaniels? He's  my  age. 
 When I want to get high, the only thing to replace that need is doing other crazy sh1t. 
 So like an hour ago, I stole a $20,000 ring. 
 All I asked you to do was not f*ck my husband. 
 [Moaning] 
 Jesus. Letty. Wait. 
 If you don't tell her, I will. 
 Letty, I would love you to join us for a family dinner we're having next week. 
 I'd love to. Great. 
 Your beloved son is a contract killer. 
 You were a killer at 16, and you're a killer now. 
 You're evil. 
 [Speaking Spanish] _ 
 Go. Take the car. I don't need it. 
 I will. 
 And I'll take you.

Guess my invitation got lost in the mail. Well, there's the restraining order. A-And, also, I don't feel you've been very supportive of my relationship with Rob. Where's Jacob? Tiffany's. Why is he at Tiffany's? I am not bailing you out until you tell me exactly what happened. Seriously? You're holding me hostage? Now you know how it feels. I was getting dressed to go to The Happy Cue for the wedding... [Chuckling] Isn't that where you got married last time? Yeah. You weren't there. In fact, I think you were right over there. Or was it  that  one? Are you done? 'Cause I am seriously not moving until you tell me what happened. Rob proposed last week. It was all very last-minute. I was a little nervous, so I pre-gamed it with a few glasses of Korbel, and Rob couldn't drive because he was still drunk from his bachelor party. So, we're halfway to the Cue, and we get pulled over by that idiot Samuelson. Remember him? Yeah, I remember. So you got a D.U.I.? I got somewhat of a D.U.I. Where was Jacob? What was I supposed to do, leave him home alone? Jacob was in the car? Jesus. Which one of us should have the restraining order? Look how much you love saying that. I do. Well, Jacob is just fine. Can we go now? [Buzzer] You take good care now, Estelle. Thanks, Joyce. Tell Roger I said hey. Will do. Bye, Letty. Bye, Joyce. Baby. Baby, I'm so sorry, baby. I should've been the one driving, but the boys got me doing shots, and you know I'm... You f*cked up. [Sighs] I f*cked up. Completely ruined our wedding day. Look at me. Look at me. Hey. We are still getting married, all right? You are still gonna be Mrs. Robert Jake McDaniels Jr. Your middle name is Jake? Yeah. Oh, hey, Letty. Thanks for bailing us out. Oh, my God. I just realized you're gonna be my stepdaughter. [Chuckles softly] Get me out of this dress. Don't have to ask me twice. Rob. What? I meant like I want to go home and get out of this dress. That was the meaning of that sentence. We're going to Tiffany's first to pick up Jacob. No, we're not. I need to get out of this dress, and I obviously need to remind you of the thousand feet. I just bailed your ass out of jail, so today we're going to f*ck the thousand feet. Javier! Hi, Rob. Love the Range Rover Sport. I been thinking about getting one for Rob's Grasshoppers, for like, the VIP-service aspect. Do you like it? That is one sad sight. I know. Look, I'm sorry about all this. You're still with the hottie? Yeah, I'm kind of in a rush, Tiff. Can you go get Jacob? Look, I'm not trying to be a judgy bitch... Then don't be. I love you, you know that, but this is the second time in two weeks I've had to pick up Jacob from the authorities. I know, and I appreciate your help. I'm always here to help you, but... maybe I could use some help, too. You ever stop to think about that? Yeah... I tried to help you with Kyle. I... What do you need? I'm right here. No, you're not. You keep leaving. But I'm here now. What's wrong? [Chuckles] Everything. Everything's f*cking wrong. Look around at the house. Might be the last time that you see it. What, like mortgage sh1t? Yeah. How is Kyle? Living in his office, probably shooting up heroin. He doesn't shoot up. What? He snorts it, which is actually a good thing. [Chuckles ruefully] Or  better  anyway. There's a silver goddamn linin'. How in the hell did we get here? I don't know. Can you go get Jacob? He's at the movies with Autumn and Dax and the babysitter. Tiffany! What? You could've told me that five minutes ago. Look, he's had a rough couple days. I think he should stay here again tonight. You can pick him up in the morning. Okay. Fine. I'm sorry about Kyle. Yeah. Rob : Hey, are you a Washington Nationals fan, Jav? Because Atlanta can suck my dick, and if we're gonna hang out, you got to love the Nationals. What sport are they? Get the f*ck out. Baseball. [Chuckles] I was hoping Jacob would take to it, but he's not really the sports type. Maybe he just doesn't like baseball. Estelle : Hey, it's back on! Danny says we can have the Cue tomorrow from 6:00 until whenever. Ow-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! All your wedding guests who showed up yesterday are also free tomorrow? Yeah, that's why they're called friends. They will drop whatever they are doing to see you get married. Hey, you know what this means... Bachelor party 2.0! And this time, Javier can come. Hey! I tried to invite you to the first one, but I couldn't find you on Facebook. When? Now! The Happy Cue! Great. Let's go. Is it really the best idea for you to be going out right now? Don't be such a whore, Letty. Let Javier off his leash. There's no leash involved. He does whatever he wants. Well, good. Baby, I'm going. Mm! [Smooches] Come on, Javier. Let's go. Yeah. [Sniffs, sighs] Hey, hey. Who are you right now? I don't know. Just don't... Just be careful. Estelle : Mm! Oh, my God! [Moaning] Ahh! Mmm! That was amazing! Yeah, just make sure that your PayPal account is up to date. Okay. Bye-bye. What's with the red wine? I cut down to two glasses a day. Well,  there's  an AA rule I haven't heard. How does phone s*x still even exist? Well, not everyone has a computer. Yeah, they do. Well, people still call. Besides, it pays well, and I get to give back, it being a mostly geriatric clientele. You're a true Samaritan. Hey! I make my own hours, and I'm there to pick up Jacob after school, so... Does Rob know what you do for a living? Yes, he knows what I do for a living. Because when that third guy you married... What was his name... Joe? Jeb. When he found out, he smacked you around pretty good... broke your arm, as I recall. Rob is different. He likes what I do. Says it's a turn-on. Sometimes he calls and pretends to be somebody else. Okay. I know you think I'm insane for getting married again, but he's good to me. And he doesn't try to control me. He is the first guy I have been with who just totally gets me and lets me be me. Mm! Wait. You're gonna ruin your pedicure. Here, let me put some... You need to shave your legs. Remember when you told me in sixth grade I was too young to shave? And of course you did anyway. And you took off like 10 layers of skin. And you still wouldn't let me drive you to the emergency room. You weren't home. I did the best I could. I know. I mean, I guess I could've done better. We all make our choices. See, it wasn't my fault that you dropped out in 10th grade. I never said it was. I tried to get you to go back. I know. You were just such a goddamn handful. So were you. Yeah. I guess I was. You never visited me in prison. You told me not to. You should've anyway. I'm trying to do better. So am I. I know you are. [Sighs] Have you ever thought about lifting the restraining order? Yeah, of course I have. [Voice breaking] I'm not giving you any more money. I gave you over $100,000. Baby girl. Your money is not gonna get me to lift that restraining order. I sat in some kind of homeless cum pool in that cell, and it won't come out. Now I'm gonna have to get married in sweatpants. You must have another dress. No, I've lost so much weight nothing fits. Come upstairs. It's too tight. It'll zip. It'll break the zipper. It'll zip. Fine. Do the breathing thing. [Breathes deeply] Exhale more, more. Blow out every breath in your body. [Both grunt] Both : Told ya. [Sighs] It's perfect. Fine. It's perfect. I'm keeping custody of Jacob. But I lifted the restraining order. When? Couple days ago. But I just asked you to lift it, and you... I said that your money would not be the thing to get me to lift it. Oh, my God. You got big-time issues, baby girl, but I know you love that boy, so maybe he'll be the incentive for you to get things right. [Voice breaking] Thank you. [Engine revving]

♪ Until the day I die ♪ I had a job at a sh1t bar in Georgia... doorman. Bouncer stuff. I had nothing in my life, no family... only Ava, but she was busy raising two girls. One night at the bar, the boss wanted me to throw out this drunk asshole. But the guy put up a fight... good one. I ended up hitting him one too many times with a pool cue. And he died. I felt very bad. It made me... sad. But because of what happened, my boss asked me to go see this other guy who owed him money. He said he would pay me, so I did. It was easy money, and this time I didn't feel bad. I felt... in control. No one died. This went on for awhile until one day the boss says he knows a guy who wants to hire me. He says his sister was murdered by her husband just because he didn't want to lose money in a divorce. The brother found his sister in a barrel of acid. She was still alive when her husband put her in there. But he had a good lawyer, so he got off, and the brother says he wants justice. So I think about it. And I decide this man should be dead. If the law did its job, he  would  be dead. So I did it. I killed this man who put his wife in a barrel of acid. And I was okay with it. That was the first time. And for a long time after that, I took jobs to end people who should be dead. But after awhile, I stopped always asking what their story was. 'Cause it doesn't really matter. These people are going to die one way or another. I'm just a bullet. Someone else pulls the trigger. I don't... I don't believe I am evil. But I believed it when my father told me I was... when I was 16. And so it began. It makes sense. [Sighs] Rob : Believe me, I have seen some crazy-ass sh1t in my life, some crazy-ass sh1t. But what you did last night... Where'd that Harley come from? That was insane! I have no idea. You guys won't even believe what happened last night. It was completely insane! So, we're down at The Happy Cue, and my boy Zeke is completely hammered... These spics keep bringin' their sh1t into this country. ...saying spic this and spic that. All I'm sayin' is  your  people keep comin' to this country and takin'  our  jobs. Rob : And then, Javier gets more pissed off than I've ever seen anyone get pissed off in my life. And he tells Zeke... If you say one more word, I will end you. So then Zeke, who's the stupidest f*ck I've ever met, starts talking about building borders with Mexico to keep out spics like "Frito Bandito." I think it's a good idea to build a wall. And then the sh1t went down. I mean, you knew he was really gonna kill that boy... [Grunts] .. but instead... he gets all quiet and calm as a cucumber. And he tells Zeke that, if he wants to live, to give him his Harley. [Chuckles] So then Zeke... who by now realizes, uh, he should've kept his frickin' fat trap clapped... knows he's in a world of sh1t. I mean, he's scared, and he should be. So Zeke just nods like the dumb sh1t he is and hands the keys to his bike over to Javier! But wait! That's not even the best part. 'Cause then Javier makes Zeke drive over to his house, get the title to the Harley, and sign it over to Javier. So there's no question Javier now owns Zeke's bike! The whole thing was completely... insane! Respect, man. You're [sighs] insane. Hee-hee! Did anybody get hurt? Uh, Zeke Hansen's reputation for not being a big pussy. That's what got hurt. Let's get this sh1t show on the road. Hey, you can take my Jeep to pick up Jacob. I'll take Javier's. He obviously has a new ride. Uh, yeah, he does. Hey, baby, I got something in the truck. Forgot. Hey, Letty. Um... Hey, I wanted to show you something. I-I need your opinion. What do you think? It's really nice, Rob. Whew. [Sighs] All right, 'cause... 'cause if you like it, it's definitely nice. She'll love it. Were you scared when the cops pulled Nana over? No. It was just one cop. [Chuckles] It was funny. Rob started laughing, so the cop arrested him, too. [Chuckles] I'm sorry you had to stay at Tiffany's. It's okay. I played with Autumn. Oh! Not like that. Oh. Okay. So, I have some good news. And bad news? No, just good news. We can see each other whenever we want to now. Did Nana say it was okay? It was her decision. How cool is that? Yeah. Yeah! Why is Nana getting married again? Um... I guess because Nana and Rob love each other. Did she love all her other husbands? She thought she did. Sometimes people keep trying until they get it right. Sometimes it takes a person some extra time to get things right. Why didn't you marry my dad? Because we... It wasn't like that. Like what? You don't have to be married to have a baby... you know that, right? I'm 10. Well, that's what happened. But did you love him before that? I can't talk about it. I just want to know. I don't want to talk about it. Why not? Jacob! It's a simple question. No, it's not! No more questions. [Nelson's "Love and Affection" plays] [Indistinct conversations] ♪ Here she comes ♪

Rob : Hey, everybody. Thanks for coming. We already got the license, so we decided we'd just marry each other ourselves. [Laughter] I'm a little nervous. Me too. Uh, I'll go first. Okay. [Paper rustles] [Clears throat] "The first time I-I saw you walk through that door right over there, I said, 'Damn, who's that fine-looking woman? She must be new in town.'

My friend Amber's mom took us downtown to go shopping at Christmastime, and we were in this crappy little store when I saw that rhinestone brooch. I just had to get it for my mom. I really thought it would make her happy. The part she's not telling that lady is that the brooch cost $16 and I didn't have enough money. So when nobody was looking, I put it in my pocket. My heart was pounding right out of my chest as I walked out the door. But it was the most excited I had ever felt in my life. Any other kid would've gotten out of there as fast as they could, but not me. I wanted to keep feeling that feeling... forever. The minute I realized I'd gotten away with it, I went right back in and stole a box of Mike and Ikes. Who? It's candy. It's kind of like jelly beans. And who are Mike and Ike? I don't know. Nobody.

Look, you might be able to fool Jacob, but I know you're the same evil f*ck who got me hooked on meth. You ruined me! I've changed, Letty. I got a good job. I go to church. You... Really? Hey. You're the Myrtle Beach Hardbodies guy. [Chuckles] See? Yeah, I saw that commercial. It's ridiculous. I've done six more regional commercials this year. I'm starring in an all-black production of "Our Town." I've changed, Letty. But you haven't. I don't think this place is healthy for Jacob. Leave. He told me he's the only black kid in his school. Don't  ever  try to contact him again. I didn't contact him. What? He found me. Been FaceTiming for like two weeks. Last night, he told me he was at Tiffany's because your mother was in jail with a D.U.I.? That sounds... unfit to me. Get out! Get out of here! Oh, I will leave, but I  will  get my son. And I  will  take him out of this place. No, that is never going to happen. It's not just what I want. This is what my son wants. Don't ask me. Ask Jacob. Said you weren't a "normal mother." Pretty sure the judge will agree. My attorney will be in touch. ♪ ♪ Tell me he's lying, Jacob. What? Tell me you did not go looking for that man. He's my dad. He's  not  your dad, not in the way that matters. That person cannot be in your life. Why don't I take you two home so you can talk? You stay out of this! Do not do this here. [Breathing heavily] I need to know how you found him. Autumn told me she saw my dad on TV. What? She was watching TV with her mom, and his commercial came on. So Tiffany told you who he is? No, Autumn said her mom just kind of blurted it out to her. Autumn wasn't supposed to tell me, but she did because she likes me. Then I kept on watching his commercials when they came on. Then I searched online, and it took a couple of days, but I found his e-mail address. Okay, okay. I'm not mad at you, Jacob. Why would you be mad? Because you went behind my back! You lied! You lied! You said  this  was my dad. My real dad didn't even know I existed. You said he didn't want to know me, but he does. I was trying to protect you. Why? He's nice. You said he was dead. You don't understand, Jacob. He's a very bad man who has done terrible things to me and to other people. He told me he  used  to do bad things but now he goes to church and doesn't drink or do drugs. Well, that doesn't necessarily make someone a good person. You can't believe everything people say. No sh1t. Okay, that's enough! You don't like him because he's black. What?! Did he tell you that? You're just like everybody else in this town. You pretend I'm not different, but I am. Baby, I-I don't pretend anything. I look at you for all the things that make you unique, all the things that make you exactly who you are. If you're not happy in this town, y-you don't have to live here. We can go someplace else. What if I want to move to Myrtle Beach with him? He's said there's more black people there. No, you're not... You're 10. You don't get to make those decisions! [Cries] I don't know what to do. Well, why don't we just take Jacob with us tonight? Aren't you going on your honeymoon? Yeah, we're just taking the boat up to the lake for tonight and tomorrow. I think it's the best thing in case Sean comes back. That piece of sh1t is lying. He hasn't changed. Church? Please. You can't be totally sure of that. He can't take him. [Sobbing] He can't. Mom! [Sobs] No. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Come with me. [Suspenseful music plays] Put this on. Where are we going? Does it matter? ♪ Wild horses ♪
