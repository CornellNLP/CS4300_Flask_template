 Javier : Where are you going? 
 Home. 
 You don't have a home. 
 A girl can dream. 
 I want to get a job, normal place to live, all the things. 
 You come by the house with $1,000 in cash, and I will let you spend the day with Jacob. 
 I'll do it. 
 Smile. 
 [Cellphone camera clicks] 
 I got a call from your brother last week. 
 All he said was he was returning your call. 
 I called him five years ago. 
 What's this? 
 Heroin. 
 You're getting help. 
 All you do is hurt people. 
 That is all that you are capable of. 
 You can't stay here. You know that. 
 But I have nowhere to go. 
 You're leaving? 
 I'll be back for you, Jacob. You hear me? 
 You came. 
 You called.

 [Muffled rain falling] 
 I can't live in that town ever again. 
 So, one day you  will  get Jacob and live somewhere else. 
 At least he knows you love him, that you want him back. 
 He might not want  me  back. 
 Of course he does. 
 Every child wants their parents. 
 Not every parent wants their child. 
 I know. 
 Me, too. 
 My father doesn't speak to me. 
 My mother doesn't speak to me. 
 No one in my family speaks to me. 
 Aren't we on the way to see your sister? 
 She's the only one who speaks to me.

 Gary. 
 Cockfighting is animal abuse. 
 You understand that, right? 
 But Ma-ghellan... 
 But Magellan? 
 He invented it. And he's Ma-ghellan. 
 Cockfighting has been around 6,000 years, Gary. 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 Magellan started his voyage in 1519. 
 He did witness a cockfight in 1521 in the Philippines, where it's still legal. 
 So maybe you should move there. 
 But it's not legal in any of the 50 states, which is where  you  are. 
 North Carolina. 
 [Sighs] 
 Bye, Gary. 
 Letty : This looks nothing like me. 
 I look like Ginger Spice. 
 Who? 
 From the Spice Girls. 
 Oh, yeah, the, uh, red one. 
 The hair color is priceless. 
 Yeah, still, you can't wear that wig again. 
 Bullshit I can't. 
 I'm not throwing away an $8,000 wig. 
 You spent $8,000 on a wig? 
 No. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 Are you judging me for stealing a wig? 
 I guess so. 
 Amazing, considering what  you  do for a living, which we're not doing anymore. 
 I'm sorry? 
 No more dead bodies. 
 You know this is what I do. 
 If you don't want to be around it, why did you call me to pick you up? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 [Sighs] 
 It actually kind of looks like you. 
 Kind of. 
 But it could also be Mandy Patinkin in "The Princess Bride." 
 Who? 
 Nice work. 
 What do you mean? 
 With Gary. 
 What a piece of sh1t. 
 He definitely should be in prison, if that's what you mean. 
 Yep, right next to your Letty woman. 
 I'm not so sure about that. 
 What makes you not sure? 
 You know... [Sighs] 
 I've been doing this a long time, Todd... 
 Lot longer than you. 
 And yet I'm your boss. [Chuckles] 
 Why are you so obsessed with her? 
 Why am  I  so obsessed with her? 
 She hasn't shown up to a check-in in weeks, yet you keep giving her a free pass. 
 Oh, that's not true. 
 I saw her last week, then I rescheduled Saturday. 
 Rescheduling is not a thing. 
 It's a thing. 
 I rescheduled Letty for this morning. 
 Uh, she hasn't shown up yet. 
 Uh, I was just about to call her. 
 That's why I have a phone in my hand. 
 But now I'm talking to you instead. 
 If you don't find her and send her back to jail in the next 24 hours, you're fired. 
 You can't do that. 
 I can definitely do that. 
 Such a prick! 
 [Receiver slams] 
 Excuse me? 
 Nothing. 
 Great. 
 Again, awesome work with Gary. 
 You are really good when you want to be. 
 [Door closes] 
 Woman : [Through cellphone]  Even when I take a wrong turn, 
 I will find another path. 
 [Horn honks] 
 I live by my positive choices. 
 [Brake engages] 
 Letty : This is that same funeral home. 
 Yes. 
 Your sister lives here. 
 No. She used to. 
 Today, I feel good. 
 So, what are...? 
 No. No. I told you, I am not... 
 I'm glad to be alive. 
 Is there a dead body in this car? 
 No. 
 And you never have to kill anyone as long as I never have to listen to this ridiculous app woman ever again. 
 She has nothing to do with who you are. 
 [Car door closes] 
 Thanks for doing this. 
 I'm driving down to Ava's anyway. 
 Oh, it's a huge help. 
 It's fine. 
 Did my brother call again? 
 Since yesterday? No. 
 So he's called three times? 
 Yeah. 
 You think Ava knows what's up? 
 She does. 
 She says she needs to talk to me in person. 
 Think they found out? 
 I don't know. 
 Jesus. 
 Yeah. 
 [Whirring] 
 Who's that? 
 [Whirring] 
 A friend. 
 You've been single as long as I've known you. 
 I am still single. 
 Bullshit. 
 Not bullshit. 
 I want to meet her. 
 You're not meeting her. 
 Why? 
 Because... she's a hooker. 
 Are you sh1tting me? 
 No. 
 You're about to drive my daughters two hours with a... 
 Silk. She's not a hooker. 
 Your daughters are safe, okay? 
 But you're not meeting her. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hey! 
 Hey, Uncle! 
 You guys ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay. Awesome. 
 Bye, Dad. 
 All right, bye. 
 [Seatbelt slides] 
 Daniela : So, how long have you guys been dating? 
 We're not dating. 
 Then what  are  you doing? 
 Of course we're dating. 
 Your uncle's just afraid of commitment. 
 [Chuckles] That's what Mom says. 
 Dani, wait. We need to take another one. 
 [Cellphone camera clicking] 
 Better. 
 Now she's using another app to make us look skinnier, smoother, and whiter. 
 Not whiter. 
 Jesus, Dani, I'm not racist against us. 
 Has he cooked for you? 
 Not yet. 
 You're a private chef, Uncle Jav. 
 You should make her dinner. 
 A private chef? 
 What did you guys talk about on your first date if you didn't talk about all of this stuff? 
 Letty's a... high-school English teacher. 
 No, I'm not. I'm a writer. 
 Yeah, but you teach to make money. 
 No, I used to teach. Not anymore. 
 So, what do you do for money? 
 I work for Instagram. 
 Seriously? 
 I delete all the nude selfies. 
 Wait, did you see mine? 
 I did.

 Almost!

 Anyway, it's printing out, and while it's doing that, here's your room key.

In the sky... ...In the sky make all my decisions for me? Well, your best thinking got you here. [Laughter] I saw you spilled. Freshie on the house. Christian : Oh, thank you. Mm-hmm. FYI? The "here" your best thinking got you to is this bar, richer than you were a few hours ago by $100,000. Man : Excuse me. [Sighs] I'm gonna buy that bottle. Don't buy it. If you really want it, we can steal it. [Cellphone vibrates] It seems like it would be cleaner just to buy it. I mean, that's the point of having money, right? No. Then what's the point? Getting things you really want but you can't steal. Like my son. For good. You can't buy your son from your mom. Oh. I guess you can. I know what you should buy. You d-yeah? Your freedom. My freedom. You really think I'm that miserable. Kinda. Yeah. You never have to go back to your stupid job with stupid Gary... Not ever again. You don't have to try to get losers to stop being losers anymore. You calling yourself a loser? I'm not a loser. I'm awesome. You are. [Sighs] What the hell would I do? Whatever you want. I just hope I don't have to take a fearless moral inventory of myself. I really don't want to do that. That's the addict talking. You're a good guy. Even if you are a stalker. [Laughs] Javier : Letty. Look who's breaking the rules. Hey. As long as you know the rules, you can break them every once in a while. Hmm. Sit down. Sit down. Is this... This is the guy I've been, you know, whatever. How are you? Christian. I've heard a lot abo... I... actually, I haven't heard a lot abo... It's all been very nebulous. Probably a good thing. Letty : Definitely a good thing. Christian's my parole officer, so... Christian :  Was  her parole officer. I quit. I'm quitting. You are? Either that or I'm going to get fired. Whatever comes first. [Laughs] Hey, I might be here a little longer than I thought. Can you go back to the house and check on the girls? Javier : Yes. Of course I can. You must be Ava. Letty. Right? Yeah. Without a wig. Yeah. Obviously the girls told you everything. Of course they did. Good. I knew he wouldn't. [Laughs] Okay. I hope I'm not overstepping, but, Letty, I'd love you to join us for a family dinner we're having next week. Umm. Yeah. I'd love to. Great. Great. Javier has all the details. I'm so sorry, but I... I have to run. I had a bit of a security issue today. Oh. Oh sh1t, yeah. Go. Go. See you soon. See you. Don't forget the girls. Do you want to come with me to the house? I should probably stay with Christian. Uh, n-o, no, no. Please, go. I'm good. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I'm great. I'm celebrating. Never stop. And never stop stalking me. Don't worry. Thank you. Thank you. What was the security issue? Someone stole $200,000. No sh1t. $211,000, to be exact. [Exhales sharply]
