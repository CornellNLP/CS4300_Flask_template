 Oh, I'm Mrs. Diaz, all right. 
 Only the best for Mrs. Diaz. 
 Trash bags, gloves... the kind that... 
 I know which kind you like. 
 Gummy bears. 
 Jacob. 
 Hi, Dad. 
 Get out! Get out of here! 
 I  will  get my son. 
 Mr. Barron may be the more natural parent in this case. 
 Don't worry. Custody almost always goes to the mother. 
 Unless the mother is me and the father is a manipulative psycho. 
 I am here for you. 
 I don't want you here for me. 
 We are separate people. 
 Rhonda Lashever. 
 Your former parole officer said that you, Ms. Raines, might be willing to help me locate this man. 
 They will guarantee you get custody of Jacob. 
 All you have to do is give us his handle. 
 You're not saying goodbye. 
 I am. 
 [Glass shatters] 
 Are you the philanthropist? 
 Don't say that out loud. 
 Oh, um, sorry. 
 Don't be sorry. Just don't do it. 
 I won't. 
 You did. 
 Oh, right. 
 Um, I just mean I won't do it again. 
 I think this is everything you asked for. 
 Why are you sliding that under the bar? 
 I don't know. I-I thought... 
 It's an envelope. 
 There is nothing wrong with an envelope. 
 No one will arrest you for giving me an envelope. 
 No one will arrest me for holding an envelope. 
 The police won't suspect I did this? 
 Of course they will. 
 I-I-I don't want that. 
 Then don't have your wife killed. 
 After I walk out that door, there's no turning back. 
 She will be dead tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 Um... that's what I want. 
 Are you sure you will be happier without her? 
 I'm sure. 
 I wouldn't make any more trouble for yourself. 
 You're burning the eggs. 
 What? 
 Jacob : You're burning the eggs. 
 What? 
 Thanks. Sorry. 
 I was just thinking. 
 Me too. 
 Will you be mad if the judge says I should go live with my dad? 
 I mean... I wouldn't be happy. 
 Would you come live in Myrtle Beach, too? 
 No. 
 If the judge says I should go with you, where would we live? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 In a car? 
 No. 
 Then where? 
 It won't be in a car. 
 It'll be someplace nice and safe. 
 What will we do when we get there?

 [Metal detector beeping] 
 Can you take your belt off, please, ma'am? 
 Really? We know it's a belt, so... 
 Yeah, you're fine. 
 Have a good day. 
 You, too. 
 I'll make sure Jacob calls you every week. 
 That's sweet. Very generous. 
 Very confident. 
 Well, way things went down last week, I mean, yeah, I feel confident. 
 Good. You should. 
 I'm sure you'll get him. 
 But if I get him, I'll also make sure he calls you every week. 
 Serious? 
 As long as you promise to pick up. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Feeling good? 
 No. 
 How you feeling? 
 Medium. 
 Huh. 
 [Door opens] 
 Holy sh1t. 
 I'm done. 
 What? Why? 
 Bailiff : All rise. 
 Judge Myers : Okay. We are on record in 16CV1164, Barron vs. Raines. 
 You may be seated. 
 Ms. Raines. Welcome back. 
 So, you do juvie and family court? 
 This is Danville. I do all the courts. 
 How long has it been? At least five years. 
 At least 15. 
 Well, you look good. 
 You, too. 
 Okay, I have reviewed the recommendations of the court-appointed mediator. 
 I understand Mr. Barron is gainfully employed and wishes to assume full custody of his son. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, Your Honor. 
 And I'm sure you know this, but my client wasn't aware he even had a son until just a few weeks ago. 
 And why was he not aware? 
 Because Ms. Raines did not make him aware, nor did her mother, Estelle Raines, who has had custody of Jacob for the last few years after she got a restraining order to make sure that her daughter couldn't come within 1,000 feet of him. 
 Why did you keep the truth from his father? 
 Sean Barron has a history of drug use, dealing, and drug-related violence. 
 Ms. Raines is and always has been concerned for the child's welfare. 
 Ms. Raines has a page-turning history of her own. 
 And she has shown great reform. 
 As has Mr. Barron. 
 All right. 
 I do hereby grant full custody of Jacob Michael Raines to his mother, Leticia Raines, effective immediately. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I commend your reform and your commitment to your son, Mr. Barron. 
 You will have two weeks visitation every summer as well as every other national holiday until Jacob is 18. 
 That's all. 
 I don't know what I did right in there, but I am not gonna question it. 
 Don't. I couldn't have gotten him without you. Thank you. 
 I got to go, but, uh, congrats again. 
 Letty... good luck. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 Hi. 
 I'm so nervous I'm doing a cake mix. 
 Is it done? 
 Yeah, it's done. 
 What happened? 
 He's mine. 
 What? 
 I got him. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 I know. 
 I worked hard on that kid. 
 I know. 
 I'm gonna work hard, too. 
 Good. 
 Um... so, should I pick him up from school? 
 What time does he get out? 
 I can pick him up. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 I'll see you later. 
 We're sorry. 
 You have reached a number that is no longer in service. How the hell did that happen? I'm sorry? Yeah, you're sorry. You want to tell me what the f*ck I missed in there? I don't think you missed it, Sean. The judge gave me custody. Why? I don't know. Go ask him. No. Something's wrong here. Something has always been wrong here. I did what I was supposed to do. What people like you and me are supposed to do. I changed. Really? Because you have that same look in your eye you always had when you were about to hit me. You want to hit me? Go for it. [Sighs] We're sorry. You have reached a number that is no long... We're sorry. You have reached... Jesus Christ. [Cellphone rings] Letty. Been on pins and f*cking needles. I got Jacob. Oh, thank God. But I need your help with something else. Okay, good timing. What's up? Did they contact Javier yet? Who? The FBI. I have no idea. Where's that woman? That Lashever beast. I have no idea where. But, I mean, she's based in Asheville, right? Yeah. They arrested you at your old office. Yes. Are you in Asheville now? Yeah. I'm not sure how long, but I doubt I'll be back tonight. Can you put Jacob on? Are you kidding me with this? Can you please put him on? It's your mother. Hello. Hey, baby. It's all over. I know. So, where are you? I'm not there. I know that and I'm sorry, but I have to talk to Javier. So, where is he? I don't know, but I'll be back tomorrow. How do you know you'll be back tomorrow if you don't know where he is? That's fair. But I think you and I will be... I think it'll be better if he's with us. I agree. You should find him. Here's Nana. ♪ I'll miss them for all the tears they shed ♪

He obviously burned his phone. He does that a lot. I don't have to f*ck her, do I? No, you just have to get a drink with her and distract her so I can grab her phone. How do you know she'll say yes? Because she had a clear boner for you. She did not. Christian, she thumb... your mouth. She spread that mayo around your face like somebody yelled "money shot" on a p0rn set. That was a s*x thing? Jesus, yes. It was a s*x thing. And she gave you her cell. You're already, like, three dick pics behind. She's probably waiting. Just call her. [Sighs] How are you gonna get her phone? You ask more questions than a 10-year-old. Hit speaker. [Cellphone rings] Lashever : Hello? Hi, it's Christian. Woodhill. Hi. Christian Woodhill. From the thing. I know who you are, idiot. I arrested you. Oh, right. So, I was wondering if you wanted to, uh... follow up. On what? Hello? I'd like to... take you for a drink. Are you in Asheville? Yes. You know Hooper and Charlie's? Uh, all too well. Can you get here soon? I'm already a couple of drinks in. See you in a few. God, she's already at a bar. Girl after our own hearts. Can you text me her contact card? W-Wait. You're gonna call her now? Oh, my God, can you please just do what I say? And hurry up and get changed. I can't wear this? [Groans] So... I'm... That's a very nice pantsuit. Nordstrom Rack. You like Nordstrom Rack? I think I probably do. You do. Now, listen. I want to be clear with you about something. Okay. This is not a date. Okay. This is work-related. Absolutely. But if we do sleep together, that's also work-related. [Laughs] [Chuckles] Oh. So, uh... was it a store-wide sale? What? Your pantsuit at Nordstrom? Nordstrom Rack. [Cellphone vibrates] Want to go on a cruise? Uh, sure. No, that was a test and the answer was, "No, Rhonda, cruises are giant floating petri dishes," so [imitates buzzer] Fail. [Cellphone vibrates] Come here. Where? Toward my face. Really? That's what you got? Uh, I'm sorry. I'm bad at... This is hard. What is? Uh, finally sitting across from you after all that buildup. It's hard. It is? Very. Hard. Well, what are we gonna do about it? I'm not sure this is a problem we can fix. Think you might have to do it. What do you want me to do about it exactly? Whatever I tell you? Ahh. Can I have a preview? First you're gonna get on your knees. Do you have carpeting or do I need kneepads? I'm kidding with you, Woodhill. [Laughs] Oh. Ahh. BRB. Potty break. Nice work. Let's go. I got what I needed. I-I think I-I actually might stay. Yeah? I mean, I'm gonna get laid. Where are you going? Probably better you don't know. Are you gonna tell Javier the truth? Are you kidding? He'll never speak to me again. So, how you gonna stop him? I don't know. I'll figure it out when I get there. You always do.

I can look that up for you. What name is the reservation under? Pereira. Do you mind spelling that? P-e-r... e... r-i-a. Hmm. I don't have anyone here by that name. Are you sure that's how you spell it? We just got married. I'm still learning it. Do you know what? Try Santino. Santino Pereira, or is this a new last name? Can you... can you try it as a first name and a last name? I'm confused. Don't be. Just type it in. There are no first or last name Santinos or Pereiras. If you'll excuse me, I have to check in the next guests. Look, I'm sorry. Here's the deal. My husband and I have this thing where every year on our anniversary, he checks into a hotel under a different name, and then I knock on his door and pretend like I'm another guest staying at the hotel who's been locked out of her room. Why? You know, like role playing. Oh. Fun. [Chuckles] Very. Only this year, I've clearly forgotten the name. Well, uh, shoot some more names at me. Let's see if we can find a match. Amazing. Thank you. Uh, try Diaz. I have a Mr. Diaz in room 434. Great. Can you make me a key? A key? I thought the fantasy was that you're a guest in some other room? That's right. Thank you for reminding me. Room 434? 434. [Elevator dings] 
 
 [Doorbell rings] Diaz : Can I help you? I'm sorry. I must have the wrong room. Well, who are you looking for? Mr. Diaz. Well, that's me. I-I'm Mr. Diaz. I'm sorry.

I'm just standing here. Okay. Full custody? Yes. Sean has some visitation. That's good. How did this happen? I guess custody usually goes to the mother, so... Even you? I know. [Chuckles] Congratulations. Come with me. No. We're a good team. We are not a good team. New car? Yeah. It's... It's the same, but black. Like my hair. What? This is the red wig. The one you told me never to wear again. I dyed it black. I told you I wouldn't throw away an $8,000 wig. You did. [Sighs] Where are you going? Somewhere you're not going. Look, I didn't mean to say we're separate people. We're not. I need you. No, you don't. Yes, I do, and Jacob needs you and you need us. I'm happy for you. Then... Please. Go and be happy. Can I get my car, please? [Door opens] I thought you were done killing people. I told you to go. I thought you were done with this. When did I say that? I never said that. Whoever this person is, maybe they don't deserve to die. They do deserve to die. How do you know that? You don't ask for their stories anymore. They... they volunteer their information. Now, Letty...

Go kill that person and live with yourself by yourself. [Door slams] [Knock on door] Hi, Estelle. [Knock on door] Estelle. Estelle. Come on. Don't be that way. [Knocking on door] What are you doing here, Sean? I want you to tell me what kind of fucked-up sh1t went down at the courtroom. I have no idea what you're talking about. And I'd like you to get off my porch. Letty pulled something. Sean, you need to get off my porch. Fine. Just let me see Jacob. [Chuckling] Absolutely not. He's my son. Just get Jacob. You're not supposed to be here. I am supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be right here. I'm his father. I'm calling the cops. Put that phone down, you bitch. Shut your goddamn mouth! Or I'll shut it for you. He's my boy. I know. And I'm sorry. But that is my wife and that is my grandson inside, and you will treat them with respect. I just want to see him. Is it summer? What? Is it a holiday? No. Then you don't get to see him. So you can leave right now, or we can wait for the cops. Where's Letty? She ain't here. Yeah, figures. Whenever she does get here, you tell her I was here for my son. I'll be back for him. It better be... Christmas. [Car door closes, engine starts] ♪♪ What would you like? Everything. Hmm. Will this work? It's a start. Rough day? Well... I tried to stop my hit man boyfriend from getting caught at a hotel down the street in a sting I helped set up after cutting a deal with the FBI so I could get my kid back. [Rewinds] Will this work? It's a start. [Chuckles] Rough day? Yeah. Wish I could tell you about it. Well, it's kind of my job for you to tell me about it. Not this. Okay. You strike me as someone who does just fine on their own. Maybe. Should I be okay with just fine? My experience? When you're with someone, they always try to change you. And who wants to change, really? I do. We're all just who we are, I think. [Chuckles] But if there was some magical person who could make us better, I mean, they would've already done it, right? No, no. Not here. Sorry. Don't be. Happens all the time. Now what happens? We go upstairs. Three minutes, then pay the bill. Then come to room 917. Room 917, three minutes. No. Three minutes, then pay the bill. Then room 917. What the hell are you doing? I have to stop you. You don't have to do anything. [Elevator buzzes] Please! There's something I have to tell you. I sold you out. To the FBI. The man you just met is an undercover FBI agent, and there are at least two more down there watching you. If you get out of this elevator and go to that room, they will bust in two seconds later and you'll be done. [Scoffs] What? Letty, I know you now. I know your lies. The FBI? You're right, I'm an amazing liar, but right now, I am telling you the truth! Listen to me... we're over, done. You need to leave me alone. How else do you think I got Jacob? It was never gonna happen in a million years, and now he's mine. I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do? So, let's just go. No. We are not good for each other. I know. You and Jacob are good for each other. Maybe. [Voice breaking] But I can't do it alone. You will have to. What are you doing?

I didn't want to risk Sean finding it after he showed up yesterday. What? What did he want? What do you think? Jacob. So you better take that boy and disappear. But he can't just show up. When that man wants something, he always gets it eventually. So do I. Hey, baby. Hi, mom. I'm sorry I had to leave. It's okay. I'm used to it. Sean came here, and he was really mad. Yeah. I'm sure he was. But when I see him, I want it to be fun, okay? For summer and the holidays. Every other holiday. Should we make a list of all the holidays and choose which ones? Sure. But... otherwise, you're gonna be with me. Where are we going? Are you sure you want to take Jacob? No. Yes. I don't know. If you're gonna raise a kid, you have to be totally selfless and that would be a good thing for you to try on. He doesn't want to go with me. He doesn't know what he wants. Last week he wanted to be a product tester at Piggly Wiggly. [Chuckles] It's your job to not care if what's right for him isn't what he wants. I don't even know how to start. You just start. He wakes up. He can be a straight-up little sh1t in the morning. It takes the will of the wolf to get that boy out of his bed. He's had all the vaccines. He's always coming home with only one sock. Don't know how, but just always make sure you buy the exact same one so you can match different pairs together because it's f*cking annoying. He'll want different colors. Don't do it. It's a trick. He gives his lunch away if another kid is hungry, so always make sure you pack him extra. He thinks he likes sushi, but he doesn't know what it is. [Voice breaking] He needs time alone. Like you. So if you take him to a party or whatever, just make sure you plan on that or else he just shuts down. Oh. He wet the bed until two years ago. There haven't been any relapses, but don't let your guard down just yet. That should be enough to get started. [Sighs heavily] Oh, my God. The rest is a lot harder than that.
