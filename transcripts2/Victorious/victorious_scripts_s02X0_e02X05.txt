 Hi. 
 Shh, not now. Look. 
 Whoa, daddy. 
 Andre has been working on his new little girlfriend over there for, like, 10 minutes. 
 So, after school, I was thinking we could maybe... 
 Yeah, that sounds great. 
 Okay, is Andre trying to swallow that girl? 
 No, I think they're just kissing. 
 Here he comes. Here he comes. 
 Don't let him know we were watching him. 
 What's up? 
 Nothing. 
 Just hanging, you know. 
 We were not watching you kiss that girl. 
 Cat. 
 It's all right. 
 I hope you all enjoyed the show. 
 Oh, it's my brother. 
 Did he get me the stuff? 
 Yeah. 
 He says he got you the clown costume, the power drill and 12 gallons of blood. 
 Wow. Where'd he find 12 
gallons of fake blood? 
 You wanted fake blood? 
 I'll go call my brother. 
 So, should I ask why you want blood, a drill and a clown suit? 
 It's for a live performance I'm doing. 
 Ah. 
 What's it about? 
 A clown and a parachute that doesn't open. 
 What's it called? 
 "clowns don't bounce." 
 they don't. 
 No. 
 They don't do that. 
 Come to the show and you'll see why. 
 Well, it's your fault for partying too hard. 
 Ohh. 
 What's up, Rob? 
 Oh, hey. 
 Ohh. 
 What's wrong with Rex? 
 We went to the northridge prom this weekend. 
 Ohh, those northridge girls. 
 I feel like a prom bomb went off in my head. 
 Ohh. Ohh. 
 And I have a stomach virus. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Hey, when is our prom? 
 We don't have a prom. 
 What? 
 Proms are stupid. 
 I love proms. 
 Which makes sense, 'cause you're you and proms are stupid.

 wait, what do you mean there's no prom at Hollywood arts? 
 There isn't. 
 There's never been one. 
 You're sure there's never been a prom here with coyotes and a big pile of burning tires? 
 This doesn't ring a bell? 
 No. 
 I don't think that stuff happens at proms. 
 Hmm. 
 Wait, why are we talking about proms? 
 'cause I wanna have one, here. 
 Oh. 
 Well, you need to talk with the head of student activities. 
 I am, right now. 
 Sikowitz, you're the head of student activities. 
 Really? 
 Yes. So can we have a prom? 
 Yes. 
 Yay. Thank you. 
 But... aww. 
 It's got to either be this Saturday or last Tuesday. 
 This Saturday? 
 But that only gives us, like, five days to get everything ready. 
 Then you best hurry. 
 This is an oven mitt. 
 Okay. Okay, okay. 
 I can do this. 
 Just a couple of questions... please, later. 
 I really need to take my grandmother to the hospital. 
 Oh, sure. Okay. 
 Oh. Ohh. 
 Oh my God. 
 I didn't know she was here. 
 It's okay. Neither does she. 
 All right. 
 I created this little computer model of the asphalt cafe. 
 That's where we have lunch. 
 Yes, it sure is. 
 Are we gonna talk about this prom or what? 
 Okay. 
 Since you mentioned prom, a lot of people have told me they don't want Hollywood arts to have a normal prom. 
 So the first idea I came up with is we call it a prome. 
 Right? 
 It's innovative. I like it. 
 It's really stupid. 
 Yeah, prome. You're a genius. 
 Now, get on with it. 
 I had a burrito for lunch. 
 Thank you, Rex. 
 Now, decorations. 
 Any ideas for a prome theme? 
 Okay, okay. What if... okay. 
 What if the theme was like, space pirates, you know, from outer space? 
 Oh, and there could also be kangaroo babies. 
 Yeah? Yes? 
 Look, we only have a few days to put this prome together, so we need a simple theme. 
 Balloons are fun. 
 My father owns a rubber factory. 
 And they have balloons? 
 Oh, yes. 
 All right. Good. 
 Now, Andre, you and I will book the band, which will play up here. 
 And... andre! 
 Mm. Yeah, yeah. 
 Rubber band sounds good. 
 Okay. 
 Now, next, we should probably talk about... oh. 
 Hey, Jade. 
 Did you wanna join the... you just had to have your stupid prom this Saturday night? 
 We're calling it a prome... I was supposed to do my performance this Saturday night. 
 Now, sikowitz says I can't 'cause you booked the asphalt cafe for your stupid prom. 
 Prome. 
 Cancel it. 
 No. 
 No? 
 No. 
 No? 
 No. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Have your prome. 
 But know this... you're gonna wish you didn't. 
 Andre, did you hear what she said? 
 No. What'd she say? 
 Cat? Cat? 
 Oh, hey. 
 I don't know if you have a... 
 Did you hear what my giraffe just said? 
 He's so inappropriate. 
 I... I don't know if maybe, you know, maybe you wanna go to the prome with me? 
 Ehhh. 
 Would ya? 
 Oh, Robbie. 
 I'd love to go to the prome with you, but another boy already asked me. 
 Really? Who? 
 Tug. 
 Tug? 
 Yeah. 
 He goes to burbank high. 
 He's a football player. 
 You've never mentioned tug before. 
 I know. 
 I just met him at the mall. 
 He works at bed bath and yonder. 
 Thanks for asking me, though. 
 Thanks for responding. 
 I wish I'd asked her before tug did. 
 Dude, you've been lied to. 
 Cat doesn't have a date to the prome. 
 She said she does. 
 Man, no one's named tug. 
 And what football player works at bed bath and yonder selling pillow cases and fruit soap? 
 She lied to me. 
 That little... say it. 
 That little... say it. 
 ...fibber. 
 Ooh. That is some manly rage. 
 Hey, sinjin. 
 Oh, hey. 
 So, listen. 
 I totally deserve to be prome queen, right? 
 Um, okay. 
 And I'm sure I'm gonna win. 
 But since people are voting online, I was thinking that you could help, you know, make sure I win? 
 What are you saying? 
 I want you to hack into the slap and rig the voting. 
 I'll do it, if you'll be my prome date. 
 Gross. 
 I know. 
 But at least you'll definitely get to be the queen. 
 All right. 
 But I want the full experience. 
 You have to stay near me and talk to me and maybe share a laugh. 
 Deal. 
 Eww. What is this? 
 It was meatloaf. 
 Okay. Lights? Done. 
 Band? On the way. 
 Decorations... sinjin, do not lick the balloons! 
 Be free. 
 Hey, Andre. 
 Will you go check the... andre! 
 Ooh, sorry. 
 Why don't you go get us some punch? 
 No, no, baby. Punch first. 
 Please. 
 Okay. Keep those lips warm. 
 Oh, I will. 
 I'm gonna do that. 
 I'm getting sick of that girl. 
 Then why are you always kissing her? 
 She won't stop. 
 I keep trying to talk, listen to music, get to know each other better, but to her, I'm just a pair of sweet, buttery lips. 
 Aww. 
 
 
 
 Hey, who's your date? 
 Ohh, I knew I forgot something. 
 Well, maybe I can just dance with you and... yup. 
 ...Robbie and... well, hey there, promers. 
 Uh, what are you doing here? 
 Well, I didn't have anything else to do. 
 Beck's in Canada, and you got my performance canceled. 
 So here I am at your prome. 
 Bye, have fun. 
 See you later. 
 Well, hey there, Cat. 
 Hi. 
 Where's your date? Tug? 
 Oh. Well. 
 See, he wore this cool hat that spins and lights up, but the batteries died, so he went across the street to get new ones. 
 Of course. 
 What? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 I'm sure that's true. 
 It is true. 
 Come on, Rob. 
 Let's move along. 
 Yeah. 
 It's getting a little too fibby around here. 
 Okay, everyone. 
 Gather around. 
 Tori. 
 Welcome to the first ever Hollywood arts prome. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, okay, the band will be here soon. 
 But until then, if you haven't voted for prome queen and king, you still have time. 
 Yes. 
 Remember to vote 'cause anyone can win. 
 Just use your phones to go to The Slap and remember, you can only vote for one queen and one king, so... 
 What's going on? 
 Okay, guys. It's okay. 
 It looks like the electricity went out, so just relax until I... 
 What? What? 
 Oh my God. 
 Hey, hey, what is that? 
 It's freaking everybody out. 
 I don't know. 
 Guys, guys, give me five minutes to work this out. 
 I am so sorry... hey, Tori. 
 How's your prome going? 
 Turn on the power. 
 Turn off that freakish video, and then go home. 
 And miss the rest of this prome? 
 No. 
 I think the fun's just begun. 
 Yeah, well think again, 'cause there's not gonna be any more of your stupid little pranks. 
 Oh. 
 Then you better tell that shrimp in your bra. 
 Shrimp in my bra? 
 How did she do it? horrible. 
 Turn it off. 
 Jade, are you done with your little sabotage game? 
 Done with what little sabotage game? 
 Hey. Sinjin found the projector and killed the crazy video. 
 Oh, good, good. 
 Now we just gotta... - yeah. 
 Yeah. yeah! 
 Right! 
 Take that, you freakdemon. 
 Okay, people, this prome is back in action so... oh, hey. 
 Did you call the band and find out why they're late? 
 Yeah. 
 Their manager said you called and canceled them. 
 What? 
 No, I didn't cancel the band. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Looks like Tori Vega's prom has turned into one big boobity-boo. 
 Prome. 
 Here's your punch. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 That's enough. 
 I'm uncomfortable. 
 Hey. Are you gonna stop? 
 Nah, I'm still pretty thirsty. 
 Give it back. 
 Sure. Yeah. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 You just leave my prom alone. 
 Maybe now you know what it feels like to plan something and then have it ruined by someone else. 
 Aw, you're such a big baby. 
 Weird you just said that. 
 Doug, over here. 
 Oh my God. 
 You Tori Vega? 
 She sure is. 
 What is that? 
 I'm Doug, the diaper guy. 
 Yeah, and? 
 I do parties? 
 I was hired to come here and do my thang. 
 Hired? 
 Yeah. 
 And what is your thing? 
 Well, I sing, I dance, I'll pee my pants.

 oh, no. 
 He's like a man-baby. 
 Who changes him? 
 Well, hiya, Cat. Weird. 
 I still don't see your "date" 
 anywhere. 
 Where is tug? 
 Well, he was standing next to a candle and his jacket caught on fire. 
 Yeah. 
 You see how one lie leads to another? 
 I'm not lying. 
 Look, if you didn't wanna go to this prome with me, you could have just said so. 
 It's not that I didn't wanna go... you didn't have to make up lies about some fake football player named tug with a spinning hat and a jacket that caught on fire. 
 But I'm not lying. 
 Good night. 
 Robbie, I... I said good night. 
 I think I put my jacket out. 
 Oh, tug, it's all burned. 
 It's okay. 
 If anybody looks at my jacket, I'll just do this. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, hey. 
 What now? 
 Lots of people are startin' to leave. 
 Why? It's not even 10:00. 
 They're mad 'cause there's no band. 
 There was a freaky video. 
 And Doug's diaper doesn't really fit him too well. 
 Whoo. 
 Okay, fine. Whatever. 
 Everyone could just go. 
 Jade wins. 
 Oh. Excuse me. 
 This prome isn't over until you announce prome king and queen. 
 You guys wait here. 
 Yay, Doug. 
 He's so naked. 
 Bye. 
 Sorry the prome was so lame. 
 We can only blame Tori. 
 Drive safe. 
 You guys, everybody, please wait. 
 Don't leave. 
 Look, I'm sorry that the prome hasn't gone so great. 
 Yeah, you failed. 
 But before you all leave, I'd like to announce our prome king and queen, who you all voted for on The Slap. 
 Yeah. 
 Yes. 
 Let's hear those winners. 
 You sure I'm gonna win, right? 
 It hurts that you doubt me. 
 Okay. 
 And Hollywood arts' 
 first ever prome queen is... Jade West. 
 What? 
 What? 
 What? 
 That's right. 
 Congratulations, Jade. 
 No. Stop congratulating me. 
 I'm not your stupid prome queen. 
 Don't touch me. Don't touch me. 
 And Hollywood arts' 
 first ever prome king... Doug the diaper guy. 
 What? What? 
 Are you kidding? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, yeah. oh. 
 No!
