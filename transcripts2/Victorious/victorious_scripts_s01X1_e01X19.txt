 Listen. 
 Ms. Travis, listen to me. 
 What? 
 This is a simple surgery. 
 I've done this operation hundreds of times. 
 You'll be fine. 
 But what if I'm not fine? 
 What if I die on that operating table? 
 I have three... 
 Uh-huh. 
 I have three... 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
 I have three children. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, kids. 
 Excuse me. 
 I don't mean to interrupt the scene, but Tori, look at the red dot I drew on this index card. 
 Boo! 
 Sikowitz! 
 You scared the Fudge outta me. 
 Why did you stop crying? 
 What?! 
 You were playing the role of a crying woman who's just been told she's going to have surgery. 
 Why did you break character? 
 'Cuz you interrupted our scene and screamed boo in my face! 
 Tori and Andre, take your seats. 
 I'm trying to teach you kids about method acting, and that means whatever character you're playing, you must stay in that character, the entire time, no matter what happens. 
 Whether on camera or off camera, on stage or off stage, you've got to understand that... 
 Until tomorrow. 
 Look, I'm sorry we disappointed you. 
 Yeah, it's just that we think that method acting is kinda dumb. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, of course you think method acting is dumb. 
 It's too challenging for you. 
 Yeah, I really don't think that's the issue here. 
 Staying in character no matter what happens is something only true, professional actors can pull off. 
 Sometimes I forget you're all just children, you know, amateurs. 
 He called us amateurs. 
 Your whack-job teacher just called all y'all out! 
 I love it. 
 Aw, I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to hurt your little amateur feelings. 
 He did it again. 
 I really don't think method acting is all that hard. 
 Then I issue a challenge. 
 What kinda challenge? 
 Who wants to have a sleepover at my house? 
 I do. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You guys don't wanna see where this lunatic lives? 
 No offense. 
 It's all right, Jade. 
 I savor your bitterness like a sweet, rancid cream sauce. 
 So what's the plan? 
 All of you will show up at my house on Friday night at 7 P.M. 
 Each of you will be playing a distinct character, and you must stay in your character until Saturday morning. 
 And what happens if we break? 
 You'll be immediately banished from my home. 
 So who picks the characters we play? 
 Beck, you'll choose for Cat. 
 Cat will choose for Robbie. 
 Robbie will choose for Beck. 
 Andre will choose for Tori. 
 Tori will choose for Jade. 
 Jade, you'll choose for Andre. 
 I think that deserves some applause. 
 We'll meet in the black box theater after school to hear who's playing what. 
 Hey, Tori. 
 Maybe you should play a woman who loves to make out with two-foot tall guys who happen to be me. 
 Is that what you wanted? 
 Rex?

 Okay, Beck. 
 What role will Cat be playing at the great sikowitz sleepover? 
 Cat will play a 1980s standup comedian who's very annoying. 
 I wanna be a unicorn. 
 You can't. 
 Phooey. 
 Now, Cat, who will Robbie be playing? 
 Well, I've decided Robbie's role should be a motivational speaker... Ooh, I can do that. 
 ...Who just drank some weird beverage that makes his legs weak and wobbly. 
 Okay. 
 So I'm a motivational speaker with jelly legs. 
 Yeah. I'm creative. 
 Wonderful. 
 Robbie, tell us the character you've chosen for Beck. 
 Sure, one sec. 
 Okay. 
 Beck will be playing a guy from england whose accent is really hard to understand, and he's always invading people's personal space. 
 No problem. 
 Andre, what do you have in store for Toro? 
 Did you just call meToro? 
 Maybe. 
 It's Tori. 
 I know. 
 But I do love that fatty tuna. 
 Should I be offended? 
 Okay. 
 Tori's character will be a cop who wears way too much red lipstick and is obsessed with raisin bran. 
 Where did you come up with that? 
 Well, see, I had this dream last night, and this lady cop was all, like... she was all like... 
 And then I was like... I just thought of it. 
 All right, Tori, tell us what Jade will be. 
 Love to. 
 Jade will be an innocent farm girl from Alabama who's always super sweet and nice and never gets upset about anything. 
 I'd rather slam my tongue in a car door. 
 Now tell us who andrere will be playing. 
 Ulch. Fine. 
 You're gonna be a guy who's just finished running a marathon... 
 Okay. 
 ...Who also happens to be nine months pregnant. 
 Who's the daddy? 
 Got cop costume + red lips... going to sikowitz's house! Yes! 
 Feeling: Creative. 
 Oh! 
 Drinks, chips, dip, nuts and liquid soap. 
 Party time! 
 Well, I wonder who will be arriving first. 
 Well, hello there. 
 I am a police officer. 
 Would you like some raisin bran? 
 Ah, no, thank you, but please come in. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 And your name is? 
 Officer p'desko. 
 Do you have anything sharp and/or pointy in your pockets that could injure me? 
 I certainly hope not. 
 Doorbell! 
 I'll answer it. 
 M'kay. 
 Ah, good evening. Come in. 
 Thanks, thank you. Hoooo. 
 Yes, thanks for welcoming us into your fine home! 
 But don't forget to thank yourself! 
 Because if you just believe in yourself, there's nothin' 
that you can't do! 
 Hey, I'm pregnant and I just ran 26 miles. 
 Can I please get some water? 
 Of course. 
 It's right over there. 
 Okay. 
 Ah, I didn't catch your name. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I was, uh, just admiring ur fine animal statuettes. 
 I'm Kevin cornbloom, motivational speaker! 
 I've devoted my life to helping teens... oh, there go the legs. 
 Are you all right? 
 I'm right as rain, thank you for asking. 
 10-21, we got a man down! 
 Caucasian male, glasses, afro, possibly Jewish. 
 Can I offer you some raisin bran? 
 No, thank you, officer. 
 Man, I'm so tired and pregnant. 
 I gotta sit down. 
 Please, take any seat. 
 Thanks. Hooooo. 
 Yes, just believe in your dreams, and you can sit in any chair, anywhere! 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 
 
 
 Hoooo. 
 Doorbell! 
 I'll get it. 
 What I wanna know is what part of the chicken do the nuggets come from? 
 Can someone tell me this, please? 
 I mean, where's the wacky farm that raises nugget chickens? 
 Hilarious observations. 
 Please come in. 
 And don't get me started on airplane food. 
 I notice that you're a standup comedienne. 
 Where's the beef? 
 I am a police officer. 
 Would you like to join me in a handful of raisin bran? 
 What's the deal with raisin bran? 
 Is it raisins? Is it bran? 
 I wanna know. 
 Ladies, please. 
 It's not about the raisins, or the bran. 
 It's about the future, and living your dreams, and there go the legs. 
 Oh! 
 I think I'm gonna have a baby! 
 Why did I just run that marathon? 
 You all mingle. 
 I'll get the door. 
 Well, hello. 
 I don't believe we've met. 
 You are? 
 Oh, yes. 
 M'name is Malcolm Winchester fizzenworth. 
 It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. 
 It's a lovely home ya have here. 
 Let's step over in that direction, that way there, very good then. 
 Sure. 
 He got very soft lobes, doesn't he? 
 Thank you. Don't pull. 
 Hey. You. 
 Why, hello, officer. 
 Isn't this just a lovely shin-dig? 
 I can see your belly button. 
 Why, yes, that is my belly button. 
 Have you ever considered filling it with raisin bran? 
 Well, no. 
 My name is betty-sue golden-heart. 
 I live on a farm in Alabama, just north of a little... 
 Now you're eating raisin bran. 
 Mmmm. 
 I just love eating cereal that's been manhandled by your filthy hands. 
 Uh-oh. 
 I spy a fly with my little thigh. 
 Thigh? 
 Come here, you winged nuisance. 
 Where'd it go? 
 Well, I believe the fly in question went this way and then that way, and then over there, and then round-about, and every way except for that way and over yonder. 
 There he is! 
 Oh! C'mere! Time to die! 
 Sikowitz! 
 Are you okay? 
 Who... Who's there? 
 It's Robbie. 
 Ah! You broke character! 
 You're out! 
 You tricked me! 
 Precisely! Now go home. 
 Awww. 
 It was so wonderful to meet you. 
 Take care of yourself, mate, you seem like an effervescent bloke. 
 Beck, stop it! 
 At least you're not pregnant and exhausted from runnin' 
a marathon. 
 Enjoy the raisin bran! 
 9:26 P.M. 
 So far, only Robbie Shapiro has broken character, and was promptly banished. 
 That leaves five of my students still in character. 
 Why don't they make the plane outta the same stuff they make the black box out of? 
 Um, hellloooo?! 
 That was quite an amusing commentary. 
 I'll need to see your license and registration. 
 Oh. Sorry there, constable. 
 I don't own a motorcar and therefore have no such documents in me trouser pockets. 
 Why don't you stop invading my personal space and have a little of this raisin bran? 
 I'm game, so why don't you pop a dabble in me mouth? 
 Well! 
 Aren't you two havin' a fun time eatin' raisin bran together? 
 Well, it's... just be careful now, mister british man, 'cuz who knows what terrible things might happen to you if that continues? 
 Hello? Oooh. 
 Andre! It's grandma! 
 Uh, I'm sorry, this isn't Andre. 
 I'm a pregnant marathon runner. 
 Hooo. 
 Andre, don't you play games with me! 
 Oh my goodness. 
 I think I'm gonna have a baby! 
 Baby?! 
 Oh! 
 Why did I run that marathon while I was pregnant? 
 What the g are you talkin' about?! 
 Andre! 
 Who is that handsome young man over there? 
 This is my nephew, Jason. 
 He's staying with me while his parents are in Bangkok. 
 Does he have a girlfriend? 
 Because as a police officer, I need to know that information. 
 No, I'm not dating anyone. 
 Oh, then we have much to discuss. 
 Where ya headed? 
 I'm goin' with some guys to see the wall dogs play at the moxy. 
 I'll go with you to see the wall dogs play at the moxy, I'll go right now. 
 Bahhhhhnnn! 
 Cat, you just broke character. 
 Yay! Bye, everyone. 
 I'll be at the moxy. 
 And to think I was gonna let that boy eat my raisin bran. 
 More creme brulee? 
 Hurry. 
 Who's that? 
 No idea. 
 Hi. 
 Tori's not here. 
 Oh, I know. 
 Trina's not here either. 
 Well, good, 'cuz she doesn't like me anyway, so... wait, aren you supposed to be at some method acting thing at your teacher's house? 
 I was. 
 But I broke character and got eliminated. 
 So sikowitz banished me. 
 Hi, Robbie. 
 Hi, Mrs. Vega. 
 That sweater looks fantastic on you. 
 Thank you. 
 Listen, um, it's our anniversary tonight, and we're watching a movie together... Oh. What movie? 
 Uh, it's an old one called terms of endearment. 
 Oops, I've never seen that one. 
 Robbie. 
 11:14 P.M. 
 Only four of my students remain in character. 
 I have prepared some piping hot quesadillas from a recipe I got from crispin glover, back when we... well... 
 Hello. May I help... I don't know you! Ahhh!! 
 Who's at the door? 
 I'm not sure. She was... 
 Where's Andre?! 
 Well... that's a dilly of a Pickle. 
 I don't eat pickles! 
 Uh, no, you see... 
 Andre... Per se...Isn't here. 
 I see him right there. 
 'Ello love. Y'look a bit chaffed. 
 Could I interest you in a tiddly-doinks? 
 Maybe a couple of... 
 No! 
 Andre! 
 Why'd you play games with me over the telephone? 
 Ugh, ma'am. I'm not Andre. 
 I'm a male farmer who also happens to be... 
 Oh my God, who did that? 
 Grandma, listen. 
 I'm doing a method acting exercise. 
 I need you to leave... 
 Andre... 
 You broke character. 
 Come on! It's not my fault she came in here... 
 Come with me. 
 Please stop! 
 You are in trouble! 
 Not in front of my friends. 
 You are in so much trouble. 
 You're always interrupting stuff. 
 We're down to three. 
 I am infatuated with raisin bran. 
 I'm feelin' a wee bit hungry me-self. 
 Um, sweet farm girl... 
 Would you mind... 
 Getting that tray of quesadillas from the kitchen? 
 Why? I wouldn't mind at all. 
 Oh wait! That tray just came out of... 
 ...The oven. 
 My goodness that tray was hot. 
 Well, lookie there. 
 My skin's startin' to blister. 
 And I do believe that's the sweet smell of my burnin' flesh. 
 Jade, perhaps I should drive you... who's Jade? 
 My name is betty-sue golden-heart, a happy farm girl who's experiencing extreme pain right now. 
 And yet she never broke character. 
 Move this car! 
 You broke character! 
 And your neighbor's car window. 
 Go inside. Go inside. 
 Who laughs at terms of endearment? 
 It's not a comedy. 
 Hi, Tori's dad. 
 Hi. 
 This is Jason. 
 And? 
 Robbie texted me and said you guys were watching a funny movie. 
 It's not a comedy! 
 Hey! You guys, come on in. 
 Oh, popcorn! 
 Is that Debra winger? 
 Yeah, she's hilarious. 
 She's dying! 
 I am a police officer with very red lips and I love raisin bran!!! 
 Feeling: Munchy. 
 Ah, kids, it's getting late. 
 I'll never forget the time I was havin' kippers for breakfast and a musty old burger flew right above my head. 
 This method acting exercise is becoming tedious. 
 Raisin bran was invented by Kevin mcraisinberg and Jack mcbran. 
 I beg you to go home. 
 You're reminiscent of a flibbity-jibber with a nosh of kiwi and a noddy bit for the squabble. 
 I can't take it anymore. 
 All right! 
 Since it's obvious neither one of you are going to be breaking character anytime soon, and I can't stand being here with either one of you anymore, I'm going to bed. 
 You can help yourself to anything in the refrigerator, but please do not look in the cabinet under the sink in my bathroom. 
 Please. 
 Good night. 
 Have you ever seen a carnivorous wildebeast ruminate about Dan Schneider while cavorting with... 
 I am a police officer! 
 Iggafiff. 
 How is that funny?! 
 Does she ever quit cryin'? 
 Aw, she'll be dead in minutes. 
 Hey. What time is it? 
 You broke character! 
 You lost! 
 I am a police officer. And I am victorious! 
 Enjoy some raisin bran, ya freakish brit! 
 This is officer p'desko! 
 Code three! 
 Wooo-wooo-wooowooo-wooowooo-wooo-wooo-wooo-wooo.
