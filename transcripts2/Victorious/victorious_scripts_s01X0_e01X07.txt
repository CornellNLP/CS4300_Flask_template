 You know, You don't always have to be Mean to everyone. 
 See, Tori's interested In my device. 
 I'm really not. 
 Aw, c'mon little Red, Tell us about your doo-Hickey. 
 Okay, it's called: The snowbee. 
 Watch. 
 It makes pretend snow. 
 I see that. 
 It's all over my tostada. 
 And my pizza. 
 Well, do not eat it. 
 Why? 
 'Cause it says The fake snow is toxic And can cause Abdominal bleeding. 
 So what made you Buy a machine That poisons people's lunches? 
 This catalog. 
 Sky store? 
 Yeah. 
 I went to visit my uncle And uncle this weekend In San Francisco, And they had these on the plane. 
 It's like filled with all kinds Of cool stuff you can buy. 
 Oh, like this: A tree face. 
 You put it on your tree To give it a face.

 It also works on bushes. 
 Unbelievable. 
 You guys have no idea How upset I am about... 
 It snowed? 
 In los angeles? 
 I told you Global warming was bogus. 
 Stop watching fox news. 
 No, it's fair and balanced.
