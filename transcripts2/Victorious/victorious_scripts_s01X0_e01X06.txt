 Ready? 
 Action. 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, come on! 
 Why can't you admit That you're in love with me? 
 Why are you in love with me? 
 Because you're beautiful. 
 Look at your face In the moonlight. 
 I can't. 
 You can. 
 No, a person can't look At their own face, It's impossible. 
 Then marry me, And I'll buy you A thousand mirrors. 
 But that's so many. 
 My father's a billionaire. 
 I can give you Everything you've ever wanted, And I'm very good looking. 
 Um, yeah. 
 Think. 
 And lights go. 
 It's okay That you don't know. 
 But you deserve an answer. 
 I can wait, For you, I would wait a thousand years. 
 I know I'm poor. 
 I know I don't have much To offer, But I do love you. 
 Because I'm beautiful? 
 I don't love you, You're beautiful, Because I love you. 
 What up with the disco?! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I hit the wrong thing. 
 No, 15 years ago, Your mother gave birth To the wrong thing! 
 All right, Why don't we take a break? 
 Tori, Beck, you guys were great, Really nice stuff. 
 Thanks. 
 How was I? 
 I've seen worse.

 An e-mail From principal eikner. 
 That says?

 That's amazing. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Who's Sofia Michelle? 
 Oh, no, no, no! 
 What? 
 She gets to be the lead And she doesn't even know Who Sofia Michelle is. 
 Wait, is she the lady Who does those infomercials With the vibrating hairbrush? 
 I love that hairbrush. 
 Look at the cover Of your script. 
 Oh, Sofia Michelle Wrote the play we're doing. 
 She's like the biggest Playwright on broadway. 
 All right, you guys, We knew we had to be great. 
 Now, we have to be perfect. 
 We are not gonna disappoint Sofia Michelle. 
 And you're sure you want Robbie in this play? 
 I'm good. 
 At what? 
 I have to go take another Nerve pill. 
 Will you kill the disco?! 
 No one can kill disco!

 Oh, well, that is special, And I have been effected. 
 Yo, Cat.

 Aww, that bites. 
 Let's go get an "A" in lunch. 
 Wait. 
 No. 
 I just need... 
 I'm not gonna be your Monster makeup model. 
 But if I don't transform Someone's face Into a hideous monster By Monday, I'm gonna fail this class. 
 And if I don't cram A turkey sandwich Down my throat, I'm gonna fail Not starving to death. 
 Oh, come on. 
 We can do it tonight, Tomorrow night, Whenever you want. 
 I'm in a huge play. 
 I have to learn all my lines And five songs.

 I don't want to. 
 All right, I'll do it.

 Give me that. 
 For industrial use only. 
 Caution: Avoid contact With skin.

 You don't need to explain. 
 I totally got it. 
 You did? 
 You do? 
 She got it. 
 What did you get? 
 The whole commentary On what's really beautiful. 
 Having these two young men Feel true love for a girl With a hideous face, Really emphasized The whole point of the play, Which is substance over beauty, The beauty within. 
 Right. 
 Well, we're really glad You liked it. 
 Yeah, and did you enjoy My performance, Miss Michelle? 
 Wow, I am late For my plane.
