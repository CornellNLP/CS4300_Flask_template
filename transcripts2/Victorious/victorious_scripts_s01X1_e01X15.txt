 All right. Nice work, everyone. 
 Wait. Tori, Andre, Beck, Jade, Cat, Robbie. 
 Stay for a moment. 
 Um... Why do you have a woman purse? 
 I don't have a pur... Good God, where's this come from? 
 And where's my dozen bagels? 
 Can I leave? 
 Wait. 
 How would you teenagers Like to do something for money? 
 Can we have Some details first? 
 Well, I assume You're all familiar With Kevin Chase. 
 The guy who owns Like half the hotels in Vegas? 
 I'm telling the story! 
 Sorry. 
 Kevin was my roommate In college, And now he's extremely wealthy, And his little boy Is turning 
4 years old This week. 
 The big o four. 
 What do you want, man? 
 Kevin hired the waggafuffles To perform a song. 
 At his son's birthday party. 
 Oh, I love the waggafuffles. 
 ♪ wagga wagga wagga wag ♪ 
♪ your fuffle left and right ♪ 
♪ wagga wagga wagga wag ♪ 
♪ your fuffle day and night ♪ 
 shut up. 
 Rex told me to shut up. 
 Yes, thank you, Rex. 
 I'll give you this dollar To get to the point. 
 I couldn't possibly Take your money. 
 Apparently, the waggafuffles'. 
 Private jet... Crashed. 
 And so, now, Kevin needs A new musical group to perform. 
 At his son's birthday party. 
 So, you want us to form A kiddie musical group? 
 For just one performance. 
 No. 
 He'll pay you $1,000. 
 A thousand? 
 Shall I tell my friend You're all in? 
 Oh, where would we do this? 
 I'll set up the party Here at school In the black box theater. 
 You can perform on stage After the kids have their cake. 
 And ice cream, It'll be fantastic. 
 There you are. 
 Ah, my bagels. 
 Sorry about the mix-up there. 
 Pull your head Outta your pants. 
 Bye, mom. 
 That was your mom?

 Yeah. 
 Hey, you guys, guess what? 
 I got us another gig. 
 Ha-ha. 
 What kinda gig?

 I got us booked At the green meadow mall, Friday, after school. 
 Why? 
 'cause little kids love us. 
 And I thought we all liked Being the diddly-bops. 
 No, we hate it. 
 It ruined my life. 
 But they're gonna pay us, And I promised we'd be there. 
 We are never performing As the diddly-bops ever again. 
 Aw, phooey. 
 Why don't you Rip her arm off? 
 I'll be a diddly-bop. 
 You will? 
 Why? 
 'cause I'll be On stage performing And getting paid to sing. 
 In front of people who adore me. 
 You'll be dressed As a hamburger. 
 Singing to 4-year-olds. 
 Don't you have any respect For yourself? 
 Take me to the hamburger.

 Andre - Where are you ?!?!?! 
 Feeling: Searchy hey, what are you doing? 
 You missed two classes. 
 I'm just sitting here. 
 What, pouting? 
 No. 
 Listen, I know you're upset, But you're not making. 
 Things better by ditching class And sitting here by yourself. 
 Drinking a gallon Of... Chocolate beverage. 
 Do you understand that For me, being taken seriously As a singer. 
 And a songwriter is everything. 
 People do take you seriously. 
 They did, until...
