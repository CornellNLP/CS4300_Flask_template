 Traduction : Oschey I thought it was toe fingers. 
 Whatcha want for lunch? 
 I'm not sure. Hey, Festus. 
 Hello, buddy. Welcome to lunch. 
 What you got today? 
 Let's see. 
 I have the spaghetti... 
 Oh. 
 ... The ravioli. I love ravioli. 
 You let me finish! 
 Okay. Sorry. Go ahead. Finish. 
 That's all we got, the spaghetti and the ravioli. 
 I'll have the ravioli. 
 Me too. 
 I will get your foods. 
 Hi. What's for lunch? 
 Oh. He's got the spaghetti, the ravioli. 
 Ravioli? 
 You let her finish! 
 Oh, hey, I just wanted to remind you guys that I'm going away to cancun with Beck's family for semester break, and you guys have nothing fun to do. 
 So you got nothing to do for semester break? 
 No. 
 Come to the back of my truck. 
 He wants you to go behind his truck. 
 I know. 
 Hi-hi. 
 Ravioli? 
 Like pasta pillows. 
 You got a nice truck. 
 Don't lie to me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Listen. 
 How would you and your friends like to take a trip to my home country, Yerba? 
 Yerba? 
 It's very exotic island. 
 Like Hawaii? 
 Sure. Yeah, like that. 
 My brother, he's in charge of best hotel in Yerba. 
 And my people, they love to see american-style entertainment with the singing, the dancing. 
 So if you and your friends will sing and dance at the hotel, my brother will make your whole trip for free. 
 That sounds amazing. 
 So you take down my brother's phone number in Yerba. 
 Okay. 
 You reach him by dialing... 
 05... 
 05... 
 ... 631... -... 771... 
 ... 81... -... 365... -... 752...... 
 ... 836... -... 67... -... 7434...

  So I called his brother as soon as I got home, and it's true. 
 They'll pay for our plane fares, our hotel rooms, our food. 
 And all we have to do is one performance a night. 
 That sounds so fun. 
 And this island, uh... 
 Yerba. 
 Yerba, it's a cool place? 
 Yeah. Festus said it's kind of like Hawaii. 
 Oh, and I went to the official Yerba website and look. 
 Oh. Look at that! 
 Oh, white sand beach. 
 Computer. 
 Okay. So if your parents say it's cool, do you guys wanna do it? 
 Sure. 
 Absolutely. 
 Awesome. 
 Here, check out some more pics of the resort. 
 All right, cool. 
 I'm never playing mini golf with you guys again. 
 Promise? 
 What happened? 
 Trina missed a putt, so she got upset and threw a golf club at her father. 
 No. I threw my golf club, and dad just stood there and let it hit him. 
 Well, that was fun. 
 Aw, honey, it's throbbing. 
 Trina, get an ice pack. 
 No. I have to go paint my nails. 
 But... 
 Aw, it is throbbing. 
 Yes. Yes. Thank you, baby. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. Hey, did you talk to your friends about Yerba? 
 Yeah. I think we're all going. 
 Good. You're taking trina. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 You are taking trina. 
 Not happening. 
 We'll buy you a car. 
 Any car you want. 
 You don't even have to bring her back. 
 My mom says Rex and I can go to Yerba, but there has to be an adult chaperone. 
 I thought your mom moved out. 
 She's giving me one more chance. 
 Of course, you have to have an adult chaperone. 
 Why? I'm 16. 
 Adult chaperone or no trip. 
 Dad. 
 Please don't argue with me while my nose is throbbing. 
 Could I feel your throbbing nose? 
 Walk away. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yerba? 
 Yeah, it's a small island just off the coast of... 
 Oh, I know where it is. 
 I spent 2 weeks in Yerba when I was 23. 
 Cool. So what's it like? 
 I remember nothing of that trip. 
 Well, do you wanna be our chaperone? 
 To what? 
 Our trip to Yerba. 
 Yerba? 
 I spent 2 weeks there when I was 23. 
 Will you just be our chaperone? 
 Of course. 
 Yay! 
 So who all's coming? 
 Okay. It's gonna beme, Andre, c... 
 No. 
 Cat... 
 No. 
 Come on. 
 No. I don't wanna ask her. 
 No. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 No. 
 We'll both ask her. 
 What's going on? 
 My aunt says we can't go to cancun. 
 Aw, how come? 
 She found out I was bringing Jade. 
 Ha. 
 So we hear some of you guys are going to Yerba? 
 Yes. Yes, we are. 
 Would you like to come to Yerba with us, Beck? 
 Oh, that'd be great. Thanks. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, that'd be great. Thanks. 
 Hmm. 
 Jade, do you have a question for me? 
 Can I come to Yerba? 
 Hmm, maybe. 
 But first, you gotta gimme a hug. 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 Come on. 
 I don't want to. 
 Come on. 
 No. 
 Just do it. 
 Aw, see? 
 Givin' Tori a big old hug isn't such a bad thing... okay. 
 That's really tight. 
 Oh, God. Help me. 
 Aah! Somebody, help us up. 
  Feeling: Sore! 
 So I was dialing one of those things where... 
 This dump is our hotel? 
 Yeah. 
 Gross. 
 Now I'm kinda glad I don't remember this place. 
 Hello. Hello to you, buddies. 
 Which is Tori Vega? 
 Oh. That's me. 
 Are you Festus' brother? 
 Yes, buddy. I am Sgrodis. 
 It's happy to meet you. 
 Why? 
 It's a Yerbanian custom. 
 See? 
 It says, "in Yerba, "when people greet each other, "they will often sniff "each other's hands as a sign of friendship." 
 Oh. 
 Oh, that's okay. 
 So how you all like the hotel? 
 Well, um, uh... 
 It's disgusting. 
 She said what? 
 Uh, this hotel, it doesn't really look like the picture we saw online. 
 Oh, the picture. 
 Yes, there she is. 
 It is beautiful, isn't it? 
 So where's that hotel? 
 I don't know. Maybe cancun? 
 I will go get someone to help you with your bags. 
 I don't like this place at all. 
 Festus said this hotel was nice? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, this isn't my fault. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 How was I supposed to know? 
 Hey, buddies, this is Kreploch. 
 He will take your luggages. 
 That's nice. 
 Hello. We're so happy to be in your country. 
 Please! Help! 
 Let go, let go, let go! 
 Please, please... 
 Is there another bellman that can help us? 
 And here you go. 
 Well... 
 Here are the keys to your rooms. 
 Those are screwdrivers. 
 I know. 
 He said to stick it in the keyhole and jiggle it. 
 What did he say about the indoor swimming pool? 
 Well, um, apparently, this country is sort of "at war," 
 so the swimming pool here is currently filled with ammunition. 
 And where's the white sand beach? 
 Yeah, where's the beach? 
 It's, uh, it's been taken over by rebels. 
 Okay. 
 So before you booked our trip here, you forgot to find out that this is the worst country on earth? 
 Yeah. 
 Jade, don't be such a crabby cathy. 
 I have every right to be a crabby cathy... 
 All right, if you could stop it... that's... 
 Okay, I got it, custom. 
 Ah, crabby cathy is about to get a little bit crabbier. 
 I think those girls like Beck's Fluffy American hair. 
 Clearly. 
 Hey! Get your hands off my boyfriend's head. 
 Ssss! 
 Ssss! 
 Ohh! 
 Okay, Robbie and I just looked at our rooms, and there's no way I'm staying here. 
 Me neither. 
 What's so bad about your rooms? 
 Well, we can start with the foreign man I found in my closet. 
 And there was a grenade in my toilet. 
 There's nicer hotels in northridge. 
 Aah! Aah! 
 What happened? 
 Somethin' bit my neck! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looked like a moth. 
 Are you... 
 A moth? 
 Moth. 
 What happened? 
 A moth bit our friend's neck. 
 A moth? 
 Was it about this big and black like the night? 
 Yeah. 
 Ah, that was a vampire moth. 
 Well, is he gonna be okay? 
 Of course. 
 Being bitten by a vampire moth is very good luck. 
 Hah. 
 Wait, but it says here that a bite from a vampire moth could kill you. 
 Yes, but if you live, you are very lucky. 
 How can she sleep in the middle of a war? 
 I don't like this hotel. 
 Oh, come on, guys. 
 They're just bombs. 
 You know, I'm sure that... 
 Dude. 
 Robbie. 
 Hi. 
 Get out of our room. 
 No, I'm afraid to sleep alone. 
 What about Andre and Beck? 
 They made me sleep in the bathtub, and I saw a lizard in there. 
 A lizard? 
 Oh my God. 
 You guys are such babies. 
 Just because this place isn't quite as cushy as America, you make it seem like we're in the middle of... 
 Hide me, hide me! 
 Let go, let go, let go! 
 We are getting out of this country. 
 Yeah! 
 Hey. 
 Hello, buddies. Who wants mushroom? 
 No one! 
 I love mushrooms. 
 Cat! 
 I hate mushrooms? 
 We are leaving this... 
 We are leaving this country. 
 Right now. 
 Oh, buddies. 
 There they are. 
 Okay, what's all the fissy fuss? 
 We wanna go... oh my God, look at Andre! 
 What's on his neck? 
 It's from his moth bite. It won't stop growing. 
 Umm. No, no. Ooohh-eee-aaahh. 
 Oh, what's he saying? 
 I think it was ooohh-eee-aaahh. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Here. 
 It says, "a person who has been bitten "by a vampire moth will often "experience hallucinations or bizarre speech patterns." 
 Ooohh-eee-aaahh. 
 Okay. 
 I just woke up and found this sitting on my chest. 
 Ewww. 
 A dead lizard? 
 It's dead now. 
 Whoa, Andre, who's your friend? 
 Give us our plane tickets home right now! 
 Why you want to leave Yerba? 
 We hate it here. 
 Our friend is hallucinating! 
 An escaped prisoner crashed through our window and was dragged out by yerbanian soldiers! 
 And our bed is lumpy. 
 Okay. I'm very sorry about the troubles. 
 Here. 
 Everyone, please enjoy a free can of yerbanian gravy. 
 Yerbanian gravy? 
 Made in prison? 
 We don't want to eat your prison gravy. 
 We wanna go home! 
 Wait. 
 Shouldn't we at least try the gravy? 
 We are leaving this country now! 
 You kids promised to make singso here for seven nights. 
 Well, I'm afraid that's a promise they're going to have to break. 
 Are they? 
 So what song should we do tomorrow night? 
 Hey, you know what, yerbanian gravy, not so bad. 
 Let's wat the sun come up. 
 Nyaaaaaa! 
 You're really gonna let your screech box of a sister sing with us? 
 The guys are gonna keep her mic turned off. 
 Oh, that's swell news. 
 I don't talk like that. 
 Whatever. 
 Don't talk like that. 
 Do I talk like that? No, I don't talk like that. 
 Hey. Hey, Sikowitz. 
 Hey, Vega. 
 How are we gonna do this performance if Andre's sick? 
 Relax. 
 He's with a yerbanian doctor right behind that stained sheet. 
 Come, let's check on him. 
 Hello. I don't like that. 
 Okay, where is the doctor? 
 That's him there. 
 What... the boy? He's like 11. 
 Almost 12. 
 How is he, doc? 
 Eh. 
 That boy is not a doctor. 
 No, but he is the doctor's son. 
 Where is the doctor? 
 His boy is the best we could find. 
 Is Andre going to be okay? 
 Maybe. I gave him shot. 
 Now I give him lu-lu pop. 
 Vetch-goof oz. 
 Vetch-goof oz. 
 Andre? 
 You think you can perform tonight? 
 Yeah. I think so. 
 I had a dream that a little foreign boy gave me a shot. 
 Yeah, well... 
 Tori. Tori. Tori. 
 Tori. Tori. 
 Guess what. 
 The chancellor of Yerba is coming to see us perform tonight. 
 Good Gandhi! 
 Who is the chancellor of Yerba? 
 Yes, who is that? 
 Our chancellor... he like your president. 
 And look, he only has one eye. 
 What happened to his other eye? 
 It stopped working after he was bitten by vampire moth. 
 What? 
 Nothing, buddy. Forget about that. 
 Eat your lu-lu pop. 
 Good evening. 
 We're from Hollywood arts High School in America. 
 We'd like to welcome a most special guest, the chancellor of this fine country. 
 Don't do that. 
 And now we present Trina Vega. 
 Andre Harris. 
 Jade West. 
 Cat Valentine. 
 And Tori Vega.

 Aah! 
 Shvog-ha-la! Shvog-ha-la! 
 Stop the music! 
 Your shoe hit the chancellor. 
 In his last good eye. 
 I'm so sorry. My shoe justlelew off and... what are they doing? 
 Let her go. 
 She's my big sister. 
 Wait. 
 Where are they taking her? 
 To the prison. 
 Prison? 
 I got away. I got away. 
 I got away. They got me again. 
  The two of you stay quiet and don't cause trouble, buddy. 
 Where is Tori? 
 I wanna see my sister. 
 They bring her... 
 Shnitz! 
 Doctor, how is his eye? 
 Eh. 
 Vetch-goof oz. 
 Vetch-goof oz. 
 Vetch-goof oz. 
 Bok-n'voosh! 
 Let me go! 
 All I want is to take a shower! Just one shower! 
 Tori Vega, you stand accused of assaulting our esteemed chancellor of Yerba. 
 This trial will determine if you are innocent or... 
 Guilty! 
 Which way? 
 Over there. 
 This way? 
 To the right. 
 Right there? 
 This way. 
 Okay. Guilty! 
 Wait. 
 Now wait a minute. 
 This girl is entitled to legal counsel. 
 Very well. 
 Ik-boosh-veen! 
 This is my lawyer? 
 Yes! Yorvis. 
 Eh. 
 The chancellor of Yerba has deemed that that female guilty of assault upon his eyeball. 
 Do you think the chancellor is wrong? 
 No. No, no, no. She is guilty. Guilty. 
 Can I have a different lawyer? 
 Admit you did this to me on porpoise. 
 No, it was just a shoe malfunction. 
 Admit you did this on porpoise, and your punishment will be not as bad. 
 But I didn't do it on porpoise. 
 Your shoe entered my eye! 
 I know, but... 
 You are guilty! 
 Guilty as charged! 
 Four years in yerbanian prison. 
 Four years? 
 Come on. 
 This isn't fair. 
 My lawyer crawled away. 
 Remove her! 
 Wait a minute! 
 Wait! 
 It was just a shoe malfunction! 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Oh my God. 
 I've got to get a soda. 
 A soda? 
 Uhhh. Go fish. 
 Okay, that is not how we play go fish in America. 
 Careful. 
 She's the one who stabbed the chancellor's eyeball. 
 Uhhh, I am so sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Yeah, run faster. Uh-huh. Owwwie. 
 Pssst. Tori. 
 Tori. 
 Oh my God. You guys. 
 Hey, Tori. 
 Awww. 
 You've looked better. 
 Where's Sikowitz? 
 He's with Beck and Robbie. 
 They're on the phone calling mom and dad, our American ambassador, some lawyers. 
 Well, why wouldn't they call... Andre, what are you eating? 
 Salt. 
 Why would you... 
 One of the signs of getting over the moth poison is an extreme craving for salt. 
 I hate the taste, but I can't stop. 
 So, has anyone tried to beat you up? 
 No. 
 I've got some street cred in here. 
 'Cause they think I'm the psycho girl who stabbed the chancellor in his eye. 
 You are. 
 Wait. 
 Are those dudes over there? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Oh my God, this prison is for women and men? 
 Yeah, but there's a big fence separating the guys from the girls. 
 Right. 
 So you're tellin' me that freak show is a girl? 
 What are you looking at? 
 I'm lookin' at a big stupid lady in prison. 
 What are you looking at? 
 Oh, me make big man-lady mad. 
 Oh, good one. 
 Hey, call me. We'll go skirt shopping. 
 Must you aggravate my fellow prisoners? 
 Yes, I must. 
 Man, eating salt is gross. 
 Not as gross as the prison food they make us eat in here. 
 One time, when my brother was in prison, he told the people in charge that he was a vegetarian, so they gave him special meals. 
 Oh, wait, that was on an airplane. 
 Will you guys just please get me out of here? 
 We're trying. 
 Everybody's doin' everything they can. 
 Hey, Vega. 
 You wanna play rocks? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 How do you play rocks? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh. 
 Chancellor, the American entertainers are here to see you, buddy. 
 Bring them. 
 Mish-kobba! 
 Hi. 
 Chancellor, we're here to beseech you to let Tori Vega out of your filthy prison. 
 No. 
 Well, we tried. 
 Sir, hi, I'm Tori's sister. 
 And I can promise you she is a good girl. 
 I mean, is she a perfect sister? 
 No. 
 Is she the prettiest or most talented girl in the world? 
 Not by a long shot. 
 Is she... 
 How is this helping anything? 
 Look, Tori didn't mean to kick her shoe off and have it enter your eye. 
 It was an accident. 
 Hey, is that a squid in your fish tank? 
 Squid? What squid? 
 He is admiring your okkatapus. 
 Oh, this is an octopus. 
 It was given to the chancellor by the prince of gooshtavia. 
 Ahh. 
 When I was 19, I spent a whole month in gooshtavia. 
 It is beautiful country. 
 Is it? 
 'Cause I don't remember one minute of that trip. 
 Hey, come on now. Can we all get back to Tori? 
 Please let Tori go. 
 We promise you, we'll take her and leave. 
 Very well. I will free Tori Vega. 
 But you must promise to never return to my country ever again. 
 It's okay. 
 No big deal. 
 No arguments here. 
 That's cool. 
 I'll sign something. 
 Way to go, urkel. 
 What? What's happening? What's going on? 
 Nothing. 
 Chancellor, your, your okkatapus... 
 Tell me fast! 
 She is dead, buddy. 
 Bring her to me. 
 So should we go get Tori, or is there like a shuttle bus that'll bring her... 
 Aga-yoon-virma-quaz! 
 No. I don't wanna... I don't wanna go. Oh, my God. 
 You murdered the man's octopus? 
 Beck. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm kinda scared. 
 We'll be okay. 
 Yeah, but what if we don't get outta here? 
 How are we supposed to... what are those guys about to do? 
 I think they're gonna throw rocks at us. 
 Hey! 
 We told y'all we didn't wanna play rocks. 
 Excuse me, sir? Office sir? 
 What you want? 
 Why have I been put on t the girls' side of this prison? 
 I'm clearly a boy. 
 Prove it. 
 I'll stay on the girls' side. 
 I will stay on the girls' side. 
 Large, scary lady coming. Large, scary lady coming. 
 Great. 
 It's the one you called big and stupid the other day. 
 Whatever. I'm not scared of this chick. 
 So do I still look big and stupid? 
 All right. 
 Listen, hot stuff. 
 You better just turn yourself around and walk away from me 
 'cause I'm gonna... 
 I like it on the ground. 
 Tori, Tori. 
 Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey. 
 F'zock m'tog. 
 Ah-bocka-vool. 
 She's my friend. 
 Yeah. We're super close. 
 You are lucky, American. 
 I didn't need your help. 
 She would've eaten you. 
 She wouldn't have liked it. 
 Hi. Ew. Jade, your outfit's all dirty. 
 Oh, no. Now I'll never win the prison beauty pageant. 
 Wait. They have that? 
 Where've you been? 
 I joined a prison gang. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, this group of really mean, tough prison ladies said I'm cute and funny, so they invited me to join their prison gang. 
 And you said, yes? 
 Uh-huh. 
 I told the gang ladies I'm gonna make us all special t-shirts. 
 You. You, people. 
 What? 
 Who misses their favorite teacher? 
 Sikowitz. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Shhh. 
 You have to act like I'm a yerbanian prison guard. 
 Right. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Where did you get that outfit? 
 They sell these at the hotel gift shop. 
 How stupid is that? 
 Would you just get us outta this prison? 
 I'm working on that. 
 You have a plan? 
 Sort of. 
 I've got a duck truck. 
 A duck truck? 
 Yes. 
 I met a farmer and offered him a hundred svarkles to let me borrow it. 
 I joined a prison gang. 
 Oh, Cat. 
 You are delightfully filled with joy and stupidity. 
 Why are they talking to that prison guard? 
 I don't know. Maybe they... 
 Hey! 
 We're gonna die. 
 Don't act scared. 
 I'm not acting. 
 You. 
 Me? 
 How you make your hair so fluffy? 
 Tell us! 
 Tell 'em, man. 
 Just tell them what they wanna know. 
 Okay. 
 Well, it all starts with a quality shampoo and conditioner. 
 Oh, conditioner. 
 Shampoo. 
 So I'll have the truck tomorrow night. 
 Now, there's an access road right behind this building. 
 I'll be there waiting after dark in the truck. 
 When you kids jump in the back, I'll drive us across the border and right out of this poop shack of a country. 
 But how do we get out of this prison? 
 Oh, come on. 
 I'm supposed to think of everything? I got the duck truck. 
 Look, it's my prison gang friends. 
 Wait up, girls. 
 I'll be waiting in the duck truck behind there tomorrow night after dark. 
 See you! 
 Wait! 
 Sikowitz, wait! 
 Bring Rex. Oh, he left us. 
 How are we supposed to break out of this prison? 
 Hey. Hey, what's Cat doing? 
 Hips, hips, wiggle your fists. Hips, hips, wiggle your fists. 
 Heeps, heeps, wiggle our feests. Heeps, heeps, wiggle our feests. 
 There you go. You're getting it. 
 Heeps, heeps wiggle our feests. 
 I think I know how we can break out of this place. 
 How? 
 Be right back. 
 Hey, Sheema. 
 F'goosh. 
 All these prisoners, they listen to you, right? 
 G'noov. 
 You wanna get out of here? 
 Hey, hey. 
 What, buddy? 
 I wanna see the chancellor. I am ready to confess the truth. 
 Very well. We will take you to the chancellor. 
 Can you take me now? 
 Oh, now. Yeah, sure. Okay. 
 Gimme key. Gimme key. 
 So you admit you attacked my eye on porpoise. 
 Yes, I did it on porpoise. 
 I told you this! 
 I told you all she did this to me on porpoise! 
 And to apologize... 
 Yes? Yes? 
 ...Me and my friends and the other prisoners, we'd like to perform a song tomorrow night for you, your family and any other yerbanians that you'd like to invite.
