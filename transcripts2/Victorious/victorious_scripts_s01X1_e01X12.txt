 How'd you get your foot to feel like that? 
 Fish. - Fish? 
 Tiny, little fish. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa!

 Ok, these are pooka fish from puerto iguazu, and they love the taste of dead human skin. 
 Man, get me outta this house. 
 How'd you get these? 
 I know a guy. 
 Who deals in foot fish? - Yes. now, when you put your feet in the tank, the fish will nibble off all the dead foot skin and calluses, leaving your feet insanely soft and supple. 
 Soft and supple. 
 Fifty bucks. 
 Seems expensive. - You want gross, crunchy feet? Cuz girls don't dig that. 
 Feels good right? - Yeah. It's like a million tiny kisses, on my feet! hey, can you pass the salt? 
 Why should I? 
 'Cuz my french fries aren't salty enough?

 Daniel. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I had a half day. Thought I'd come visit you for lunch. 
 Well, this is so nice. Daniel gets to have lunch with his new girlfriend and his used girlfriend. 
 You know, you can try to make this awkward, but it's not gonna work, because unlike you, everyone at this table is mature. 
 And by the way, I dumped him, so hah! 
 Soooo, did you invite daniel to the kick-back? 
 Oh, my god, I forgot. - Kickback?

 That's a nice foot. - Right? I know. 
 Hey, Tori. 
 Hey, pretty thang. - Oh hush, Rex. 
 Uh, have you tried the hot cheese fountain? 
 No. 
 They have a hot cheese fountain. 
 Ok. 
 What the hairballs? 
 You got cheese in our hair! 
 Tori. 
 Why did you do that? 
 I, I, I don't know. I, I just... 
 You see. 
 This is what happens when you mix teenagers and hot cheese. 
 I warned you. 
 Tori. 
 Yo Tori. 
 We saw you run in here. 
 What's with all that stuff? 
 Sinjin and his friends are doing some play about a camping trip gone wrong. 
 Gone wrong? - They end up eating each other, I don't know Tori. 
 Tori. 
 Yo Tori. 
 Oww. 
 Tori. 
 Come out to play. 
 Leave me alone. 
 What up with the hot cheese attack on cat? 
 And her boyfriend, Daniel. 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, I'm so not the jealous type. I've never ever done anything like that before. 
 But seeing my ex-boyfriend making out with cat, I guess I just-- 
 I just lost it for a second and the next thing I knew, my hand was on the cheese-valve. 
 Oh. 
 I have to go apologize to them. 
 You wanna go feel Andre's foot some more? 
 Yeah. 
 Danny. 
 Hi. - Where's Cat? 
 Oh, she's still trying to get cheese out of her ear. 
 Oh... 
 All right, listen. 
 I have no idea why I did that. 
 Were you jealous? 
 No. - 'Cuz it doesn't make sense for you to be jealous. You broke up with me. 
 I know. 
 It makes zero sense. 
 Guess it's just a dumb girl thing. 
 Like... wearing a skirt over jeans? - Yeah, what's up with that? 
 I mean, are you maybe still into me? 
 No. 
 Not at all. And I love cat. She's like the sweetest thing ever and... 
 ...I'm psyched you guys are going out. 
 I guess it's , it's just... 
 No. 
 Cat. - Oh my god. Cat! 
 Hey, do either of you guys know what kind of meat sikowitz uses in this sausuage? 
 I asked him and he just started laughing like... 
 Bye. 
 You sure this is safe? 
 We all did it. 
 Does it hurt? - Nope. 
 Oww. 
 C'mon, if you want your feet to feel all baby soft. 
 Ok. 
 I have left her 5 Voicemails and sent her 12 text messages. 
 Why won't cat talk to me? 
 'Cuz you squirted hot cheese in her ear. 
 And played smushy-face with her boyfriend. 
 Those things upset some girls. 
 You wanna try the pooka fish? 
 Ya got rice and soy sauce? 
 No. - Then no. okay, guys. do it. 
 Do it. 
 Doooo iiiit. 
 See? 
 It feels good, right? 
 Yeah, it feels... - It's kind of like... 
 Like a million tiny fish kisses Yeeaaahhhh. 
 Cat. 
 I just wanna talk to you! 
 No! No! Get away from me! No! 
 Whoa, stop it! no! 
 Got you. - Let go. 
 No! We have to go talk! - I don't wanna talk to you! 
 Cat! - I don't wanna get up! 
 C'mon cat! - Help, I need a teacher. 
 Please, teacher... 
 Hello, girls. Can you believe I scored tickets to hall and oates? 
 All right. 
 Here we go. - Oh, god. Tori. 
 This way. Almost there. 
 Will you stop this from happening? 
 Oh, it's okay. She enjoys this. 
 Let me out! - Cat. 
 This is kidnapping. 
 Or cat-napping. 
 Open the door. 
 I'm sorry. 
 And I'm not just saying I'm sorry, I'm really, really, seriously sorry. 
 You sprayed cheese on me and then kissed my boyfriend. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah I did. 
 Why would you be mean to me? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe I did still have a few tiny little feelings left for danny and maybe that's why I went a little crazy seeing you two being all mushy together. 
 You coulda just talked to me about it. 
 I know. 
 What I did was terrible and awful and immature and you have every right to be furious with me. 
 I swear, cat, if I were you, I'd just punch me right in the face Ow. 
 Cat! 
 What? 
 You just punch me in the face. 
 You said to. 
 I know, but that's just something people say...Oww! 
 Does it hurt? 
 A lot! 
 I think my nose may be broken. 
 Well, now I feel all bad. 
 Don't. I deserved it! 
 Feel better? 
 I think so. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Will you take me to a hospital now? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 Was it broken? 
 Don't think so. Just bruised. 
 How this happened? 
 I..um..fell On what? 
 Something...hard. 
 Like a rock. 
 Wow. 
 We should get you x-rayed. 
 Take a seat over there. - Thank you. 
 What? 
 Oh my god! - What? 
 Wow, you all look awful. 
 What happened? 
 Ask your sister. 
 Eww. 
 It seems they all have myroleticulitis, an infectious attack on the central nervous system that can be very dangerous Unless treated immediately. 
 How'd they get it? 
 I have no idea. It's very rare in America. 
 Have any of you recently gone swimming in the zingu river near puerto iguazu? 
 Trina. 
 What? - Tell him. 
 Ok, I bought some illegal pooka fish from a guy in a van. 
 Pooka fish? 
 For feet smoothening? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you know how dangerous that is? 
 The saliva of the pooka fish is riddled with toxins and bacteria. 
 But feel our feet. 
 Yes, I realize that they can nibble away all of the Wow, they are very soft. 
 Nurses, feel these kids' feet. 
 Everyone. 
 Oh. ow, wow. that's nice. - That's like a baby's bottom.
