 Francis as an adult : My mother had rarefied tastes in poetry. 
 Though she had a biding fondness for Tennyson, she read Auden to us, and Yeats, and Eliot. 
 My father liked his poetry simpler, rousing stuff with a simple moral at its core. 
 He recited Dangerous Dan McGrew to us. 
 And Gunga Din, and If, but his special favourite was a poem by J Milton Hayes. 
 I'm on my way! 
 A story of a stolen talisman, and the curse that came with it; The Green Eye Of The Little Yellow God. 
 [VIOLIN MUSIC] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Halloween, ladies and gentlemen. 
 A time of ghouls and ghosts, of spooks and spectres, of whispers in empty rooms, of menace and mayhem. 
 SINISTER LAUGH Listen as if your life depended upon it. 
 Because, tonight... it might. 
 There's a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu. 
 There's a little marble cross below the town. 
 There's a broken-hearted woman tends the grave of Mad Carew, and the Yellow God forever gazes down. 
 He was known as "Mad Carew" by the subs at Kathmandu, he was hotter than they felt inclined to tell. 
 But for all his foolish pranks, he was worshipped in the ranks, and the colonel's daughter smiled on him as well. 
 He wrote and asked what present she would like from Mad Carew. 
 They met next day, as he dismissed a squad, and jestingly she told him then, that nothing else would do, but the green eye of the little Yellow God. 
 Wait till you hear the next bit. "He returned before the dawn..." 
 He returned before the dawn, with his shirt and tunic torn, a gash across his temple dripping red. 
 He was patched up right away, and he slept through all the day, and the colonel's daughter watched beside his bed. 
 He woke at last and asked if they could send his tunic through. 
 She brought it, and he thanked her with a nod. 
 He bade her search the pockets, saying, "That's from Mad Carew," 
 And she found the little green eye of the god. 
 Oh, what's that? 
 Oh, it's Yellow Man. 
 I bought some for Kate, from the hideous child. 
 She wasn't hideous, poor little thing. 
 She was plucky. The way she worked that hall. 
 Yuck, though. 
 Who killed him, Dad? Who killed Mad Carew? 
 Well, that has me beat, Francis. And do you know what? 
 I'm not even sure you're meant to know. 
 Why not? 
 Well, that's the mystery. That's what keeps people guessing. 
 You know, was it the men who believed in the god, or was it the god himself? 
 It was the men. 
 Maybe. 
 Or maybe it was the god's vengeance. 
 What it tells us is that there's a price to be paid for everything taken from its rightful owner. 
 Or even from the place it's meant to be. 
 What? 
 Amen to that. Come on, let's get these hungry children home. 
 How do you feel now, Maisie? 
 Burning up, Mammy. 
 I sent in to Newtown for Dr. Black. 
 He said he'll come if he has time. 
 She brought home them things yesterday. 
 From thon dump on the 'drome. Never off it. 
 I'm scared she's after picking up some disease at the same time. 
 Did they see us? 
 There's only one of them. And he didn't. 
 Come on. 
 Ah, come on, Francis. Don't be a feardy cat. 
 I'm not afraid. 
 Mum told me not to go. 
 Sure, she has to say that. 
 She's the mistress, but that doesn't mean you have to listen. 
 Come on. 
 Show us that. 
 Och. Why is it always you? That's the best yet. 
 I'll swap you. 
 Seamie... 
 Shh. 
 Wait till we see here. 
 What do you like best of my stuff? 
 I don't want to swap. Really, I... 
 [WHISTLE BLASTS] 
 Run. It's Stagger. 
 Stagger? 
 He's a Yankee peeler. Quick! 
 [WHISTLE BLASTS] 
 Come on, you eejit. Do you want to get catched? 
 You two! 
 Singsong : Stagger, Stagger, can't catch us. 
 [WHISTLE BLASTS] 
 Hey! 
 Come on! 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Well, I'll not keep you, Mrs. Coyne. 
 I've been down in one of the cottages. 
 A girl there is ill. Really quite ill. 
 Maisie Quinn? 
 Oh. 
 She may have Scarlet Fever. 
 I believe her sister works here as a maid. 
 Sally. Yes, her brother works on the farm, as well. 
 Well, they'll both have to stay away from this house, Mrs. Coyne, I'm afraid. 
 Scarlet Fever is highly infectious to young children. 
 We can't take any chances. 
 Dr. Black says you're both to stay away from Quinn's house. 
 Maisie Quinn is not very well. Keep Kate away from there. 
 Emma, that's your job. 
 Francis, don't pick up things you find on the road. 
 Wash your hands, and don't go near the dump. 
 Not that you ever would. All right? 
 Shouldn't Maisie be in hospital? 
 Well, I can't get her into Magherafelt at the present time. 
 Why not? 
 Her condition isn't sufficiently critical or, to be blunt, she's not sick enough. 
 However, if it develops into Scarlet Fever, then they will admit her. 
 So you'll monitor her condition? 
 Mrs. Coyne, I'm a doctor, not a nurse. 
 I've an outbreak of measles in Newtown, and a great many house calls to make to people who pay me and expect me to turn up. 
 Dr. Black... 
 Mrs. Coyne, I will do what I can. 
 I'm sending Sally home until her sister gets better. 
 IF she gets better. Maisie Quinn is sickly. Always has been. 
 She should be in hospital. 
 That is exactly what I said. 
 Apparently, if she gets really, really sick, they'll deign to admit her. 
 How will they know, huh? 
 I asked Bloody Burgess Black if he would monitor her condition, and he said, "Mrs. Coyne, I'm not a nurse but I shall do what I can". 
 Some nurse! 
 Come here. 
 I'm being hard on old Burgess. 
 He says he'll try his best, and I know he does it pro bono. 
 They can't pay him, Rose. It's as simple as that. 
 I couldn't pay him, either, to come out every day. 
 And he might come out for you, because you're English, but he's not going to work for free for a wee know-nothing girl on a boggy shore. 
 Rose? 
 What? 
 Pen. 
 OK, what are you doing? 
 Writing a request. 
 For a nurse, to monitor Maisie. 
 To Santa Claus? 
 To there. 
 I'm certain that place up there is full of nurses. 
 We have quite a sick girl in the village. 
 Her parents cannot afford to have the doctor call out routinely, but if a nurse were to check up on her each day, I believe there are a number up here on the aerodrome, it might save her life. 
 And it would be a huge gesture to the local people. 
 The Quinns are pillars of our little community. 
 I've written it all down, logically and sensibly, so you can show it to whomever. 
 I will speak to Colonel Cresswell, and then to Tillie. 
 Tillie? 
 Lieutenant Zeigler. From the Nurse Corps. 
 She would nominate a nurse if this plan were agreeable to the Colonel. 
 As I'm sure it will be. 
 Rose. 
 Thank you. Thank you so much. 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 [HE CLEARS HIS THROAT] 
 What I have to tell you is a tad awkward. 
 Oh? 
 I thought I should perhaps revert to formality. 
 Gosh, formality? 
 It's OK, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Erm, a quantity of paint has gone missing from stores. 
 The military police are going to be searching local land and buildings, including your husband's. 
 They're friendly, despite their fearsome white helmets. 
 They'll be accompanied by your local constabulary. 
 And, of course, you have nothing to fear, Mrs. Coyne. 
 No, of course not. 
 And I'm going to talk to Colonel Cresswell right now and get permission to talk to Lieutenant Zeigler about your request for a nurse officer. 
 Tillie. 
 Yes. Short for Matilda, I believe. 
 You can call me Rose again, now that you're not warning me. 
 Short for... 
 Rose. 
 Goodbye, Captain Dreyfuss. 
 Rose. 
 Kettie. 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 I was just passing. 
 I seen you. 
 Well, I thought I'd... 
 Call in? 
 See how the baby was. 
 [BABY CRIES] 
 Aye, that's her. Betty. She has a cold. 
 Oh, no... 
 Poor thing. 
 Is she getting enough, erm...? 
 No. Likely not. 
 I have some things of Kate's. 
 They're warm, and I can't use them. 
 [BABY CRIES] 
 I thought I might drop in with them. 
 Aye. Surely. 
 Next time I'm by, then. 
 [BABY CRIES] 
 Mammy, where's Sally? 
 We won't be seeing her for a little while. 
 She went home last night to look after Maisie. So... 
 I'll be cooking. 
 And if things are different to what you're used to with Sally, no complaints. 
 Even about the tea? 
 I admit, I cannot compete there. 
 She is the Wizard of a Quarter Oz. Ta-da! 
 Did you make that up yourself? 
 Of course. 
 Smart girl. 
 I married a smart girl, children. 
 [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 Who's calling at this hour? 
 I'll get it. 
 Mrs. Coyne? 
 Yes. 
 You're the nurse! 
 Lieutenant Zeigler. Tillie. 
 Rose. Rose Coyne. 
 Captain Dreyfuss said I should call by. 
 That is so quick. I have tea on the table. Would you like a cup? 
 Thanks. I'd better get going. 
 I can't be off base for too long. 
 Which house is it? 
 It's the cottage. I'll show you. 
 Do you want me to walk down with you? 
 I have a Jeep. 
 Of course. Gosh! 
 But, I mean, you don't need to walk, it's just the one at the end. 
 You're so good to come. 
 Thank Ron Dreyfuss. He's a tough guy to say no to. 
 Captain Dreyfuss. Do you like him? 
 I mean, as a superior officer? 
 Well, he's not technically my superior. I'm in the Nurse Corps. 
 But do I like him? 
 You bet. 
 He's kind of cute. 
 The cottage? 
 Yes. 
 "You bet. He's kind of cute." 
 Rose Coyne, you're a fool. 
 Want a drop, young Coyne? 
 I'll try a drop. 
 [HE CHUCKLES] 
 I'd say you would, Kettie Brady's cub, if you're anything like your da. 
 Voice on radio : 'Germany calling. German calling. Germany calling.' 
 What's Germany calling about, the night? 
 'You are about to hear our news link. To say the British Empire is in danger today...' 
 Turn thon oul blirt off. 
 '..would be a very feeble understatement.' 
 The Germans are bait, no matter what he says. 
 Give us Athlone. 
 [MUSIC PLAYS] 
 Aye. That'll do. 
 Did you see thon nurse the day? 
 The one that's looking after Maisie Quinn? 
 I seen her. Driving a Jeep. 
 She'd make a great wife that one, huh? Drive you everywhere, huh? 
 Drive you astray in the head, I'd say. She's a yank. 
 Do you know what she's called? 
 No. 
 Same name as that lamp there. 
 Hurricane? 
 [HE LAUGHS] 
 Tilley, you ganch! Nurse Tillie! 
 [THEY SHOUT INDISTINCTLY] 
 Enough! 
 The pair of yous. 
 You wouldn't need a nurse if it wasn't for thon place up there. 
 First they drive us off our land, and then they infect us with disease and pestilence. 
 What? 
 Maisie Quinn. 
 Sure, everyone knows she caught that Scarlet Fever from the dump. 
 I never heard that. 
 I never heard that either. 
 Sure, she was never off it. 
 Morning, noon and night, hunting for bangles and musk. 
 I tell you one thing... 
 Scarlet Fever's not the worst thing you could catch up there. 
 Excuse me, please. I have to go. 
 Francis! 
 And what's wrong with him? 
 It's order, that cub's getting. 
 Bed. 
 Is that Dettol? 
 Yes. 
 I, uh, washed my hands specially, like you told us, with the... 
 Maisie being sick and everything. 
 Good. 
 Now, wash your teeth, just as carefully, though not with Dettol. 
 [HE IMITATES PLANE ENGINE AND GUNSHOTS] 
 [ENGINES APPROACH] 
 All right, let us do this, gentlemen. 
 And let courtesy be our watchword. 
 Sergeant. 
 Sergeant Steiger. 
 [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 Oh. 
 I'll get... I'll go and get Michael. 
 With you now, gentlemen. 
 If you could show us the sheds, Mr. Coyne. 
 I'll just get my keys. 
 Well, Michael... 
 Make sure you check at the back of the house. 
 Why are you hiding? 
 I'm not hiding. 
 I think he's after me. And Seamie. 
 Both of you, I should think. But why? 
 Seamie shouted at him. The big one. 
 "Stagger", he called him. 
 Seamie's a cretin. 
 I don't think he recognised me, but if he gives Dad a description... 
 Calm down, small boy. 
 They're not after you, or Seamie. 
 Then why are they here? 
 They're searching. 
 For a plane? 
 Yes, a plane(!) 
 Dad's gone and hid a bomber down in the duckhouse(!) 
 Didn't you notice it last time you were down there? 
 Yeah, that'd be silly. 
 So what are they searching for? 
 Stuff that got stolen. Mum told me. 
 She's very cross about it. 
 Says it's "Draconian", which she hopes I'll have to look up, as usual. 
 I'm going to snoop. Are you coming? 
 What kind of stuff? 
 That's for me to know and you to find out. 
 I'm sorry about this, Michael. I... I know you're not involved. 
 There's nothing in here. 
 Except for us chickens! 
 Cheers. To the US Air Force. 
 Apologise for any inconvenience caused to you, Mr. Coyne. 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 Why were they searching here? 
 What Dreyfuss said. White paint. 
 I know what they were looking FOR, Michael. 
 I want to know why they were looking for it here. 
 Well, I suppose they're searching every place. 
 They're not searching Rosie's, or Tommy John's - or even the Hanlons', and they're as shady as you could wish. 
 Any chance of two bottles of stout, Michael, for the way home? 
 With you now, Failey! 
 I'll see to him. It's OK, I'm... 
 Give me your keys. 
 I'll get you your drink, Failey. 
 Straight to Magherafelt. The fever ward. 
 Can I go with her? 
 Sorry, kid. Army personnel only. Right, Lieutenant? 
 I'm saying nothing. 
 OK. This one time. 
 
 
 
 Heard it coming. 
 Maisie's away, then? 
 She'll be fine. 
 Little you care, Failey. 
 You couldn't even be there for us this one time. 
 Mrs. Coyle? 
 It's Coyne. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Sean Hamill said to call around. 
 I don't know anyone called Sean Hamill. 
 Well, Mr. Coyle does. 
 Does he? 
 And is Sean Hamill one of his suppliers? 
 Oh, he'd be that, OK. 
 Look, Hamill said Mr. Coyle would be interested in some cigarettes. 
 What kind of cigarettes? 
 Ah, look, do you want me to spell it out? 
 Free State cigarettes. Sweet Afton, Players. 
 Hamill said you'd be interested. If you're not... 
 My husband may be. I'm not. 
 Suit yourself. 
 And tell Mr. Hamill, if you see him, not to call by here any more, either. 
 Maisie off safe? 
 You know, all the time she was over there, God forgive me, I couldn't help thinking that one of ours might catch it. 
 Sean Hamill? 
 Was he here? 
 Someone was here who Hamill sent round. 
 So Coyne's shop is obviously on the map as far as the profiteers are concerned. 
 Rose, "profiteers"? That's Pathe News stuff. 
 Now everyone, every wee shop between here and Magherafelt, is on the map. 
 And lucky to get on it. 
 We're off it. 
 Rose, what are you after doing? 
 I told him, whoever he was, not to call by here any more, and to tell his friend Hamill to do the same. 
 If we can't do this honestly, then we shouldn't do it at all. 
 You'd think I was a... I don't know what. 
 Murderer, or something. 
 Why is nobody talking? 
 What do you mean? 
 You and Dad. 
 I can tell when you're not talking. 
 I'm talking. 
 If anybody would talk to me. 
 Why don't you tell the children why we're not talking, Michael? 
 So they can see the rights and wrongs. 
 So it's not just two stupid adults, rowing about something that's not important. 
 Go on. Explain to them. 
 Rose, a word. 
 Excuse me, children. 
 Don't do that to me, Rose. 
 Do what? 
 Make you confront your actions? 
 Worry the children with some sort of mystery about right and wrong. 
 It isn't a mystery, Rose. 
 And the rights and wrongs aren't as right and wrong as you're making them out to be. 
 Now, I'm trying to keep us afloat here, Rose. 
 Is that what you want me to confront? 
 It's a stout there, Michael. 
 Freezing on the lough the day. 
 Slack evening without the pilots, huh? 
 Your doing, Davey. 
 [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 It's a little bit late, I know. 
 Hard day up on the base. Erm... 
 I was just on my way to Quinn's cottage, and I thought I should call by to tell you that Lieutenant Zeigler managed to get the girl into the hospital. 
 I know. We saw the ambulance. 
 Thank you. 
 You may have saved Maisie's life, and the community will be grateful. 
 Won't you step in? 
 Your husband? 
 My husband is working... but he'd want me to invite you in. 
 I'm afraid we don't... A cup of coffee would... 
 [THEY LAUGH] 
 Plan B. I know Americans don't much like tea. 
 We have some whiskey. 
 Tea's fine. I would love a cup of tea. 
 Then I must go. 
 I'm glad you called by, about Maisie, although we already knew. We saw the ambulance. 
 Clang, clang, clang. 
 It formed a suitable backdrop to our own little... drama. 
 You don't want to hear about domestic ups and downs. 
 Well... maybe not the downs... though I guess they come with the territory. 
 Come to think of it, I'm not that familiar with "domestic" either. 
 You don't walk any more. 
 Don't I? 
 Not at the Far Rock, where we met that day. 
 I walk there occasionally. 
 I didn't want to scare the natives. Plus it's getting really chilly. 
 I'm not a native. 
 A stranger, like you, and this can be a very strange... 
 [SHE SOBS] 
 I'm sorry. It's been a trying day. 
 You're upset. I should go. 
 Oh, God. Sorry. 
 It's Maisie, and... just a lot of things, ordinary stuff I ought to be able to cope with. 
 Sorry. I don't know what came over me. 
 I feel like I should be able to make you stop being sad. 
 No, you can't do that. 
 You've done enough for the strange inhabitants of Moybeg. 
 For one day, at least. 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 Your man called late. 
 What was his errand? 
 He called by to tell us about Maisie. 
 I hope he got better manners than me. 
 [PIGS OINK] 
 Oh, piggy! 
 Oh, you're such fat boys, piggies! 
 And you smell horrible. 
 Oh, I feel sick. 
 Me, too. They stink. 
 Are you all right, Katie? No? Come on, let's go. 
 Mum! Mum! 
 Mum! Kate vomited. 
 I think it was that pig of hers. 
 Oh, poor thing. Let's bring her to the table. 
 Get that dress off her, Emma. 
 What happened, Katie? 
 The pigs smelt so bad, I almost vomited myself. 
 Emma... 
 I need you to get to the post office and call Dr. Black. 
 His number. 
 Newtown 28. Can you remember that? 
 Ask him to come out as quickly as he can. 
 Here. Pennies. Here, for the phone. 
 Go on. Quick. 
 And ask your father to come over as soon as he can. 
 OK. 
 Good girl. 
 Do you want to lie down on the table for me, Katie? 
 Now I need you to let me see under your arm. 
 [ROSE GASPS] 
 Now, I know you're very cold. We need to keep you warm. 
 Need to keep you warm. 
 Mrs. Coyne. Michael. 
 Well, she has Scarlet Fever, and she needs to go to the hospital, now. 
 I'll bring her. Would you carry her out to the car, please, Mrs. Coyne? 
 Mum? 
 Dr. Black is taking Kate to the hospital. 
 Oh, God, Mum. Is it...? 
 Ssh. 
 It's going to be fine. 
 Seamie! 
 You have to stay away from the people. 
 I am away. Further. 
 Listen, my sister's got Scarlet Fever. It's our fault. 
 It may be your fault... but it's not my fault. 
 How's it my fault? 
 Maisie got it from the dump, so Kate must have got it from the dump. 
 Aye. And who brought home thon plane from the dump? 
 I did. 
 So, whose fault is it, then? 
 Who's that you're talking to? 
 Francis Coyne. 
 Francis, you know you're supposed to stay away from Seamie till this clears up, don't you? 
 Well, go on home, then. 
 Tell the mistress I'm sorry about the wee girl. 
 Well, they think they've identified the source of Maisie Quinn's infection, and Kate's. 
 Oh. 
 A child was admitted to the infirmary in Londonderry, Tuesday last. 
 She was the daughter of an actor from a travelling players company. 
 Marsden's? 
 That's the name. And, of course, the company had visited Moybeg. 
 That's the girl, Michael. The little one with the tray. 
 She sold that awful yellow sweet to Kate. 
 Well, the child's infection had a very long incubation, but they got her to hospital as soon as it was clear that she had Scarlet Fever. 
 And... Well, how is she? 
 I'm afraid she died. 
 Oh, poor, plucky, little thing. 
 Yes. 
 So, the next two days are going to be the big hurdle for Kate. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Little pale fellow. 
 How do you feel? 
 I'm all right, Mammy. 
 What about Kate? 
 Kate is going to be fine. 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 I brought you some gas. 
 Gas? 
 Petrol. I keep forgetting we're in England. 
 Ireland! 
 Michael! Come and see... 
 It's about four gallons. 
 It should be enough to get you to the hospital a few times, to see your daughter. 
 Captain Dreyfuss has brought us petrol, so we can get to Magherafelt. I don't know what to say. 
 Thank you, Captain Dreyfuss. 
 We're very grateful. 
 Let me help you. 
 I'll put it in the barn loft. 
 I won't forget this. 
 Mum! 
 Mum! Mum! I found... 
 Where's Mum? 
 Upstairs. 
 I'm glad YOU'RE happy. 
 I wasn't happy. I was excited. 
 Mum! 
 Francis. 
 Can I tell you something? 
 Why is this happening to us? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe, just maybe, we could start with those tins in the cupboard... 
 Och... 
 And the men I don't know who come calling with stuff I don't know about. 
 And the paint... 
 I have no paint. They searched. You saw. 
 They didn't search the lint hole. 
 Francis found them. 
 He doesn't know YOU hid them. 
 You have to stop, Michael. 
 I'll lose my customers. 
 Then lose them! 
 And you won't, as it happens. 
 It's their ration books that tie them to you, not stolen goods, for God's sake. 
 You have to stop. 
 All I know is that we're paying the price for something right now, whatever it is. 
 "Whatever it is." 
 I'll tell you what it's not. 
 It's not a few fags and some corned beef. 
 And half a dozen tins of paint that I didn't even want, that Podalski - or whatever his name is - left down instead of bloody paying me. 
 [KATE MURMURS] 
 And how is it always me that's doing the wrong thing? 
 Why is it never you? 
 There's a nice head on that stout, Michael. 
 It's too fizzy sometimes. 
 You heard about young Maisie Quinn? 
 What? 
 Did you not hear? 
 She died today. 
 [BELLS TOLL] 
 What? 
 I'm stopping, OK? 
 Me too. 
 Sure, what have you to stop? 
 Bless me, father, for I have sinned. 
 Three months since my last confession. 
 I dealt in stolen goods. 
 Stolen goods. What do you mean, cigarettes? 
 Meat. And paint. 
 Paint? Stolen from where? 
 The 'drome. 
 How many tins? 
 Five, six. Six tins. Cans. 
 And what colour? 
 Huh? 
 Material attribute of the sin. What colour was the paint? 
 White. 
 White. 
 Anything else? 
 Cursed a number of times. 
 Lost my temper. 
 Three Hail Marys. 
 Oh, have you made restitution? 
 Restitution? 
 Have you given the paint back yet? 
 Not yet. 
 But I will. 
 Good. 
 All in good time. 
 Nightmare? 
 Oh, Mum. 
 Poor man. What's happened? 
 It's all my fault. Kate being sick. 
 I went to the dump with Seamie, and I brought back a thing, and now Kate's caught Scarlet Fever from it, the way Maisie did. 
 Listen... 
 Now she's going to die. 
 Francis, listen. 
 You were told not to go to the dump, and you went, and you have paid a price, and the price is fear and pain, but not Scarlet Fever. 
 Not your sister's illness. They are not the price of going to the dump. 
 We know where the Scarlet Fever came from, and it did not come from the dump. All right? 
 Promise? 
 Promise. 
 Think you'll be able to sleep now? 
 Off to bed. 
 What was the thing you brought back? 
 A toy plane. But I washed it. I promise. 
 [ROSE SIGHS] 
 With Dettol! 
 That was the smell. 
 You can show it to me tomorrow. 
 We'll make sure it's clean. 
 Now, bed. 
 I'll be in in a minute. 
 [ROSE TAKES A DEEP BREATH, SIGHS] 
 Francis, Emma, I'm better! 
 All right, you two, don't smother her... 
 [MICHAEL CHUCKLES] 
 Michael! 
 Father. 
 You know, I've been thinking, Michael. 
 The, er... 
 The church could do with a coat of paint. 
 It's got rather shabby in recent years, do you not think? 
 I couldn't afford to paint the church, Father. 
 I could make a donation, but the whole church - that's a lot of paint. 
 I know, Michael. 
 I know that. 
 I recognised your voice, Michael. 
 What about the confidentiality of the confession box? 
 Well, this is confidential, Michael. 
 This is between you and me... and God. 
 And his rundown chapel. 
 I'm taking the paint back. Making restitution, like you said. 
 Michael, restitution is going to be difficult. 
 Smuggling tins of paint back onto a heavily guarded base... 
 I wouldn't like to try it. 
 But, er, theologically speaking, I think I can help you here. 
 You see, when you make restitution, it means you have to remove yourself from benefitting from your actions. 
 It doesn't necessarily mean you have to give it back to where it came from. 
 As such. 
 So... 
 Tomorrow? 
 Early. 
 Say, before you open? 
 Aye. 
 It's just a little treacherous here, Michael. 
 Aye. 
 They're in here. Let's have a look. 
 Well, they WERE in here. 
 Somebody's after lifting them. 
 You're not, er, not playing a trick here, Michael? 
 Not, er, jesting? 
 They were in there. Half a dozen of them. 
 Ah, this parish is full of thieves. Do you know that? 
 Full of thieves. 
 Aye. 
 Francis as an adult : My mother never told me who had put the tins of paint in the lint hole, though I worked it out myself many years later, only that we were going to do the right thing and put them back. 
 And so we brought them, that evening, to the perimeter fence by the Bombstore Road, to the hole where Seamie and I used to wriggle through, and we stacked them there, knowing that the military police patrolled that area every day, and would find them. 
 And then we went home together in the twilight, my mother and I. 
 Auntie Vera! 
 You know, I was thinking, you're even improved since the last visit. 
 Look, I'm very fond of her. Why wouldn't I? 
 She's Rose's sister, but she's a loose cannon. 
 Her and drink don't mix. 
 Good morning. Oh, my gosh! 
 He is so gorgeous! 
 Rose! 
 You're married. 
 To a man who does not entirely fill your inner space. 
 I made a promise to get over you, and then I broke it. 
 And then I thought I'd been saved despite myself and now... now I'm lost again.
