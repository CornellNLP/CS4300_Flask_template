 Francis as an adult : Rooting through books in my attic the other day, in yet another attempt at a lasting cull, I came across a school prize of my mother's, an Everyman edition of Wuthering Heights. 
 As I opened it, a photo fell out, an artless box Brownie picture of two giggling girls in their school uniforms - my mother and her two-years-younger sister, Vera. 
 Why that picture was in the book, I cannot tell, but the photo brought me back to the Winter of '43 in Moybeg, when Europe was aflame and when, had I but known it, different fires were close to consuming my own settled life. 
 Rose! Oh, my sweet sister. 
 Oh, I've missed you so much. 
 Look at you. All brown and freckled. 
 Welcome back, Vera. 
 Oh, my gorgeous Kate. 
 Oh, you're well again. I'm so relieved. 
 Francis. Or should I call you Frank, now that you're so husky? 
 I mean, he's almost a man. 
 I have presents for you two, later on. 
 Oh, Sally. Sally. 
 Oh, what a terrible, terrible thing. 
 Oh! Och, Mrs. Curtis. 
 Oh, poor Sally. 
 But we're forgetting! Where is she? 
 My own special girl. 
 Married and flitted, I'm sure. 
 Emma! 
 Emma Mary Coyne. 
 Auntie Vera. 
 Look at you! 
 Completely grown up and as pretty as a picture. 
 Come. We younger girls need to talk at once. 
 Oh, I can't believe how much you've grown up in a year. 
 I mean, is it a year since I was here last? It has to be more. 
 Last November. Remember it well. 
 A year, Auntie Vera. 
 Stop! 
 "Auntie Vera"? It's Vera, right? 
 Your ally. Your sister! Your rival. 
 I bet you have the heads of all the young men in Moybeg turned right around. 
 We are going to do so many wonderful things. 
 You're going to be my co-adventurer. Not like your staid mother. 
 Mum, Mum, can we see the presents? 
 Just wait a moment, Kate. 
 But Francis and I... 
 Is a certain small person wondering what's in the suitcase? 
 Kate... 
 Well, it would be wicked to keep that person waiting a second longer. 
 It's up in Francis' bedroom. 
 Here, I'll show you. 
 I'll head for the bar, get it ready. 
 Oh, I can't wait to come out and help. 
 All those glorious men to look after. 
 Better not pick the one Mum tried to shoot. 
 Emma! 
 What? 
 No idea. Come on, let's show you your bedroom. 
 Come on! 
 She's back. 
 And I won't have an easy moment till she goes. 
 Dad, don't give her a hard time. She's had a hard time. 
 Yeah, I know that, Emma. But listen to her. 
 Young men. Your rival? 
 Turning heads? 
 This is Moybeg, not Piccadilly. 
 Full of peepers and gropers and Hanlons. 
 Dad. Dad, it's Auntie Vera, not Cleopatra. 
 OK. Maybe that was a rant. 
 But I dread her in the pub. 
 Look, I'm very fond of her. Why wouldn't I? She's Rose's sister. 
 But she's a loose cannon. Her and drink don't mix. 
 Boy, does she makes me nervous. 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 Wish I had an auntie that gave me stuff. 
 Maybe your daddy will, when he comes. 
 Here. 
 I'll swap you these. 
 I opened one of them. 
 They're balloons. 
 I wouldn't swap my tank for some balloons. 
 Show them to Davey Hanlon. 
 He might want some balloons. 
 Och, Davey Hanlon would burst them. 
 Or rob them. 
 He robbed half a dozen bullets off me last week. 
 Bullets? Real bullets? 
 Aye. 
 And when I told him to give them back, Mickey Joe said, "Give what back?" 
 And they were all laughing and all this. 
 Snotters. 
 So I'm not showing it to them. 
 Could I have my tank back? 
 What tank? 
 [HE WHOOPS IN DISTANCE] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Come in. 
 Bought you a present as well. 
 Really hard to get hold of these days, I can tell you. 
 Let me. 
 Now... 
 All the boys will be amazed. 
 Do you have a boyfriend? 
 You do! 
 Is he from Moybeg? A local? 
 He is not! The boys here are terrible. He's from Newtown. 
 Gosh. Cosmopolitan! And what does he do? 
 He's a doctor. He will be doctor very soon. 
 Well, look at you. 
 This is a real boyfriend, to be taken seriously. 
 Does Rose know? 
 Yes. No. She's met him. 
 But she doesn't know you're, you know...? 
 And have you... 
 ..you know? 
 Kissed him? 
 [WHISPERS] Lots. 
 I bet he's a good kisser. 
 So, Emma has a boyfriend. 
 What? 
 The doctor's son, Andrew. 
 That's in Emma's head, Vera. 
 She doesn't think so. 
 She's really set on him and I think he sounds... 
 Entirely unsuitable and inappropriate. 
 He's 21 for starters. She's 16. 
 Emma doesn't really know her own mind. 
 She was a very bookish child until a month ago. 
 Suddenly she's a... 
 ..a red-hot momma, which would be funny except she's naive, despite the world-weary pose. 
 And I want her to have her childhood. 
 Rose, her childhood is over. She's 16. 
 Don't remind me. 
 But she's a very young 16, and he's a pretty smooth character. 
 I'm scared she's going to get hurt... 
 ..or worse. 
 Gosh! 
 Ladies. Good morning. 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 Guilty as charged. 
 Good luck. This is my sister, Vera. 
 How do you do? 
 Delighted. 
 Now, here's the thing, Vera. 
 I was on my way to ask Mrs. Coyne's husband how things are progressing in the bar since our ban on servicemen drinking has been lifted. 
 Oh. And, y'know, I thought, "I bet Mrs. Coyne can tell me just as well as he." 
 So I stopped to ask. 
 All good so far with our boys in the bar? 
 All good, Captain. 
 Michael is very happy. Relieved. 
 And the pub is so much cheerier with all those young men in there. 
 Michael isn't the only one who's happy about that. 
 Good. Good. 
 There's something else I wanted to talk to you about, Mrs. Coyne. 
 About the schoolchildren. 
 Not now, of course, I won't interrupt your sisterly walk but... perhaps we could meet. 
 Er, of course. Where? 
 The school? It is about the schoolchildren. 
 I have a key so, yes. 
 Tomorrow morning? Say ten? 
 That would be... Er, that suits rather well. 
 Well, goodbye, Mrs. Coyne. See you tomorrow. 
 Goodbye, Vera. 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 My gosh! 
 He is so gorgeous. 
 He's married, isn't he? 
 Not as far as I know. 
 Oh, well, that's your ugly sister sorted. 
 Vera! 
 Oh, stop, Rose. I'm not going to embarrass you. 
 But he is fabulous, isn't he? 
 You agree he's fabulous? 
 Go on, if you weren't married you'd have your little beady eyes on him. 
 I defy you to deny it. 
 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] 
 ..of course. I'm quite fond of the old dear. 
 Well, I think he'll be pleased at that. 
 How will you know? 
 How can I know? 
 Oh, come on, Dad's not that bad, is he? Is he? 
 [THEY GIGGLE] 
 Come on, let's go inside. 
 Oh, delicious stew! You have everything here, potatoes... 
 We're Irish, Vera. Potatoes don't count. 
 Where's Emma? 
 Sally? 
 Er, she's upstairs, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Francis, will you go and fetch her? 
 Tell her her lunch is getting cold. 
 No, let me. Vera knows what's going on. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 I'm guessing you cycled to Newtown, to the sophisticated Andrew... and it didn't go too well. 
 Oh, Emma. 
 Don't take on so. 
 Let him know there's more fish in the sea. 
 I don't want any of the other fish. 
 Oh, Emma. That's the whole point. 
 If you curl up, men just walk all over you. 
 If you let them know you don't care a bit, they come running back. 
 OK? 
 Come on, I think you have to come downstairs for lunch. 
 Vera! You're back! 
 You girl, you. 
 I thought I might take a turn behind the bar. 
 Help you deal with this thriving hostelry you've got here. 
 Well, my God! 
 You know, I think you're even improved since the last visit. 
 And my only charge... a gin and tonic. 
 Hallelujah! A barmaid! 
 And a pretty damn cute one at that. 
 Er, sure, why don't we give it 15 minutes, hey, Vera? 
 Stout's fippence, half 'un's sixpence. 
 There's the price list for the rest. I'll have a half 'un. 
 No, no, let Vera Lynn pour it there for me. 
 Tastes better when you pour it, Vera. 
 [FIRE CRACKLES] 
 Why were you sad... at lunch? 
 It was nothing, Mum. 
 Bet Vera knows what it is. 
 Is my little girl telling secrets to her aunt and not her mum? 
 I have no secrets, Mum... and I'm not little. 
 ]SHE SIGHS] 
 Are you gonna sing us a song, Vera? 
 The old guy says you got a voice like a skylark. 
 Gentlemen, please. I'm working. 
 The landlord wouldn't approve of me deserting my post. 
 Ah, go on, Vera. 
 Sing us the one you sang last time you were here. 
 The Old Bull And Bush. Huh? 
 ♪ Come, come, come ♪ 
♪ And lay eyes on me down by the Old Bull and Bush... ♪ 
 You rascal, you'll get me into trouble. 
 Michael Coyne'll not get near you if you sing on my knee. 
 And you can be practising for the ceilidh while you're at it. 
 Vera, maybe the children might like their aunt to kiss them goodnight? 
 Oh? 
 I know Rose would love that. 
 Tuck them in, eh? 
 [MEN GROAN] 
 [FOLK MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 So how did it go? 
 How do you think it went? 
 It went the same way it always goes, Rose. 
 Your sister got drunk. 
 And I know she's got problems, and I'm happy to help, but the pub is not the place for her to exorcise her demons. 
 There's fellas in there who haven't seen a woman in months. 
 So... where is Vera? 
 Huh? 
 Is she not here? 
 Oh, gosh. 
 No, she came back an hour ago and left again. 
 She said you asked her to come back out. 
 Would I, Rose? 
 She seemed normal-ish. What was I to say? 
 "Go to bed, my drunk sister, while there's still time," 
 "before you make a show of yourself and ruin my husband's night again." 
 That? 
 I've got a bad feeling about this. 
 Ned was egging her on about going to the ceilidh. Christ! 
 [SHE SIGHS] 
 [FOLK MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [MUSIC FADES] 
 [MUFFLED SOUND] 
 [SHE LAUGHS] 
 Aye, Michael Coyne, you might come down off your high horse. 
 Michael. 
 Right then, Vera, time to go home. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 [KNOCKING AT DOOR] 
 Mrs. Coyne? 
 So this is the kingdom? 
 Did you teach the girl who died? 
 Maisie. Yes, poor thing. 
 So sad. 
 It's heartbreaking. 
 Devastated everyone. 
 I saw you comfort Nurse Zeigler. 
 Tillie was very saddened. 
 Tillie... 
 Nurse Zeigler was a great help. 
 She almost saved poor Maisie's life. 
 Yes. 
 I thought about you, a lot, since then. 
 About your daughter and her own brush with... 
 Yes. Kate is quite well again. Thank the Lord. 
 And about you, the teacher, here in your school. 
 And it came to me, what I should do, but I needed to talk to you first. 
 First? 
 A party. 
 Of course, a party. 
 A Christmas party, for the schoolchildren, in one of the hangars, to raise spirits in Moybeg. 
 What do you think? 
 I think it's a really, really good idea. 
 And would Nurse Zeigler help you to organise it or...? 
 Yes, but it's the teachers' cooperation and help that I need. 
 Your help, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Rose. 
 Oh? 
 I saw the door open. 
 I should go. I promised Tillie I'd meet her at 11:30. 
 Captain Dreyfuss is just leaving, Jemmy. 
 Thank you for checking. 
 Mistress. 
 Mistress... 
 I doubt Mrs. Curtis isn't too well today. She's after bokin'. 
 I'm sorry, Sally, I didn't realise. I'd have... 
 Och, sure. 
 Maybe something she ate didn't agree with her. 
 Yes, that's probably it. 
 There's a smell of Jeyes Fluid. 
 There's a smell of fried eggs in the kitchen. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 [VERA STIRS] 
 What is that smell? It's like... 
 Oh, it is. It's Jeyes Fluid, isn't it? 
 What possessed you to go? 
 I was helping Michael. I think they liked me in there. 
 I got the prices right, mostly. 
 In fact, I think I probably overcharged. 
 Then I got sent away on a feeble excuse. 
 The truth is, I... 
 I was hoping Dreyfuss might be there. 
 Dreyfuss. 
 Don't look at me like that. 
 I wasn't. 
 Yes, you were. You were judging. You were saying, "Oh, God, Vera, why can't you just leave men alone?" 
 Vera! I... 
 Don't, don't "Vera" me with that pained older sister tone. Don't! 
 Why can't I look at men? Why? 
 You know nothing. 
 You have everything you need here. 
 You have a husband, you have three children. 
 Look. Look. 
 What was the harm? 
 Why did that one solarised moment of happiness offend God or the devil or the universe so much? 
 Vera... 
 ..I wasn't judging you. 
 And I would love it if you found someone you would start a family with but Dreyfuss... 
 Oh, Rose. "Start a family"? I've only just STOPPED one, or did you forget?! 
 I just... want someone to kiss me... and not know I'm lost and lonely... and a wretched drunk. 
 Vera... stop. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm really sad. 
 And I have the sorest head. 
 I can get you some aspirin or... 
 I got some gin on the mail boat. 
 I'm sorry we've got no tonic in the house. 
 That's fine. Neat gin is fine. 
 [CORK UNPLUGS] 
 So...? 
 You've got that look on your face. 
 What look? 
 One I remember from when we were little. 
 Your greedy, needy face... "Rose, can I have your necklace?" 
 "Rose, can I have your book?" 
 "Rose, can I fancy Dreyfuss?" 
 Well, can I? 
 I mean, he's probably got loads of girlfriends and I... 
 Oh, my God. Bucket! Bucket! 
 [SHE RETCHES] 
 Davey Hanlon's after giving me half a crown for six balloons, Francis. 
 I could buy ten tanks for that. I'm going lookin' again. 
 Can I come? 
 No, you can't. Find your own balloons. 
 [CAR ENGINE APPROACHING] 
 Captain Dreyfuss! 
 Oh! 
 Hello. 
 Erm, sloes. 
 For making sloe gin. 
 Why, thank you. Vera. 
 Rose Coyne's sister Oh, yes, of course, I remember, Vera. 
 I take it you know how to make sloe gin? 
 You need gin and sloes, and that's pretty much it. 
 Well, erm, erm... every day is a school day, Vera. Thank you for these. 
 Give my best to Mrs. Coyne and Mr. Coyne. 
 And thank you again. I should get on with the day. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Bye. 
 Would you like to come to lunch this Tuesday? 
 Lunch? 
 Yes. 
 In the house? Mr. and Mrs. Coyne's house? 
 And Mrs. Coyne's sister Vera's. 
 [SHE GIGGLES] 
 Yes, that house. 
 Well, let's see here. Tuesday. 
 Or Wednesday or Thursday or Saturday. 
 If you're not slipping away. 
 Of course. Well, that's a very kind invitation from Mrs. Coyne. 
 It's from me but I feel sure Rose will be delighted. 
 You haven't cleared it yet? 
 Cleared it? 
 We're not in the Air Force now, Captain Dreyfuss. 
 It doesn't need signing off by a superior officer. Just me. 
 And I think it's a very fine idea. 
 And I rather hope you do too. 
 Of course. Of course. 
 Your sister, I'm just... 
 I guess I'm factoring in here that she has a lot on her plate without entertaining random US Air Force officers. 
 Oh, I don't think anyone would describe you as random, Captain Dreyfuss. 
 And as for the stuff on my sister's plate, I'm giving the maid the day off, so you can enjoy some proper English cooking. 
 
 
 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 Want to come for a ride, Barney? 
 I'm a wee bit busy. 
 Please come for a ride, Barney. 
 Come in. 
 Come in! 
 Well, young Coyne? 
 I have balloons. 
 Have you, by Hector, hmm? 
 I've got two. 
 Show us them then. 
 Holy mokers. 
 Party balloons. 
 Are they the wrong colour? 
 [THEY STIFLE LAUGHTER] 
 Oh, aye. The wrong colour. 
 Not near the right colour, huh? 
 Look, three pence for the two. 
 You can't say much fairer than that. 
 You can have them, if they're the wrong colour? 
 Deal, young Coyne. Now, away on with you. 
 [MEN LAUGH] 
 [BELL RINGS] 
 Emma! 
 That's the doctor's son. He's waving at us. 
 He's waving at me. Keep riding. Don't look. 
 Hey! Er, Emma? 
 Emma?! Er... 
 Eh? 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 I have been thinking about your kind invitation. 
 Oh, no. You're going to say you can't come, aren't you? 
 Far from it. 
 I only wondered if I could bring another officer along? 
 Oh, of course. 
 Er, Mrs. Coyne... 
 Mrs. Coyne wouldn't object? 
 No, it's my party. 
 And another officer, no, I'm sure she'd be delighted. 
 That's great. The lieutenant will be thrilled. 
 Thrilled. 
 No. No, no, no, no, Vera! 
 Oh, all right. 
 This is called a torpedo. 
 The real recipe makes you go blind so I replaced ethyl alcohol with vodka. 
 Vodka Mm-hm. 
 We don't have vodka. 
 You have the Hanlons. 
 That stuff they make is effectively vodka and it makes a fine base for a cocktail. 
 You should really know more about the natural resources of Moybeg, Rose. Now... 
 I intend to serve torpedoes to Dreyfuss and his lieutenant chum when they come for lunch, get it going with a real bang. 
 Why do you think he's bringing him along? 
 Protection? 
 From me? 
 Or me? 
 Rose! 
 You're married. 
 Happily, it says here. 
 I am too. 
 I don't want Dreyfuss, if that's what you're suggesting, at least not in that way. 
 God! Is there any other way to want him? 
 I just want... the bit of Michael I thought I was getting when I married him. 
 You're losing me a bit here, Rose. 
 I saw Michael as Heathcliff, romantic that I was. 
 And then, what I had taken to be brooding and enigmatic turned out to be quiet and stolid. 
 And that was all right. 
 I love my quiet, stolid, reliable, farmer. 
 I got used to it and I've been doing just fine and then... the waters of the lake parted and out stepped Heathcliff. 
 Which is when you spotted his literary leanings? 
 It's a metaphor, Vera. Don't be mean. 
 He seemed to offer all the things I was missing in Michael. 
 All the... danger, all the broodingness, all the enigma... and he quoted Tennyson to me in the shop. 
 Gosh. 
 He looked me in the eye and he said, "I am half sick of shadows." 
 And are you? 
 Sometimes I am, Vera. 
 Sick enough to consider adultery? 
 No! No! 
 I don't want to sleep with him. 
 I just want the bit of Michael I thought I was getting in Michael. 
 And that's all you want? 
 Yes! 
 For sure? 
 So if Captain Dreyfuss walked in wearing only a brocade dressing gown and flung himself on the bed, you'd talk to him about literature? 
 Don't tease. 
 I know I can't have that one bit of him and still say I love Michael, I know that. 
 I'm a fool, not an idiot. 
 But if you take it away from me, if you take away the chance that, in a different universe in a different set of circumstances, we could have swapped souls. 
 Always stay with me, take any shape... 
 Oh, I used to remember every word of this. 
 Where is it? 
 Oh, here. 
 "Be with me always, take any form, drive me mad." 
 "Only do not leave me in this abyss where I cannot find you!" 
 "Oh, God! It is unutterable! I cannot live without my life!" 
 "I cannot live without my soul!" 
 If you take it away... and I believe you could, Vera. 
 You're prettier and vivacious and funny and single and... 
 Oh, God. I'm asking you not to, aren't I? 
 It's all right. 
 It's not. 
 It's mean and selfish and entirely wrong but if you do that for me... 
 "The curse has come upon me", cried the Lady of Shallot. 
 [SHE CHUCKLES] 
 You're the quare smart fella, Michael Coyne. 
 The word has spread through ten townlands that the blondie is back in the bar. 
 She's my wife's sister, Mickey Joe, if it's any odds. 
 I missed her yesterday. 
 And I'm not leavin' till I get a kiss off her. 
 Hey, barmaid. This guy, his aim is true. 
 Is it now? 
 Oh, you best believe me, sister. 
 Bombing practice yesterday over the lake, he sank the damn target. 
 I did! Right on the button. 
 I could see the splashes and then - boom! 
 The last bomb in the stick. 
 Down she goes. 
 [HE CHUCKLES] 
 Robert! 
 [WOMAN SCREAMS] 
 Robert! 
 What the hell? 
 I'll get it. Poor thing. 
 Wait, Robert! 
 Robert! Robert! 
 [SHE PANTS] 
 Again? 
 Yes, it's always the same. 
 The same dark room with... choking dust billowing around me and I can see Robert's face and the baby's and I'm running to try to get to them. 
 Running like the wind, Rose, and I'm getting no closer. 
 Oh, God. 
 The last bomb. 
 The last in the stick. 
 Another ten yards, a gust of wind, the flick of a wing, Rose... and I would still have them. I would... my man and my little boy. 
 I... 
 Here. 
 [VERA SOBS] 
 "You will look for my power in the helping hour" 
 "and then you will forget." 
 Remember? 
 Wind In The Willows. 
 The otter baby, Portly? 
 Portly. 
 [THEY CHUCKLE] 
 Please... 
 God or Pan or whoever, bring me something to make me forget. 
 [COCK CROWS] 
 Last evening... that was so dog in the manger of me. 
 Well, maybe I'll like the other one. 
 No. You're to have Dreyfuss. 
 What? 
 Save me from myself, Vera. 
 Go for him, flirt outrageously. 
 You'll be doing me a favour, doing this family a favour. 
 Mr. Coyne. She didn't stop again, did she? 
 No, she's, er, running like a clock since you cleaned her, Malachy. 
 No, I'm here on a different errand entirely. 
 [CAR APPROACHES] 
 Punctual as well. 
 Go on, then. Flirt. 
 Gosh. 
 Vera. There you are. 
 Thank you for having us. 
 This is Lieutenant Zeigler. 
 Oh, Tillie, please. 
 I hope you've brought a handsome lieutenant. 
 Oh! 
 I think you two have already met but, Lieutenant Zeigler, Mrs. Coyne. 
 And I brought some flowers. 
 Oh, Lieutenant... 
 Lieutenant... 
 Oh, Tillie, please. 
 Thank you for inviting me. 
 I've always wanted to visit since I called by, since that poor girl was taken ill. 
 Let me take your coats. 
 No, of course, you were so helpful with poor Maisie. 
 I'm delighted to have you here. 
 Captain Dreyfuss. Ron. 
 Thank you. 
 So, do you flirt with her or do I? 
 That one. 
 You've a good eye, Mr. Coyne. That's a lovely ring. 
 Maybe the nicest ring in the shop. 
 Those are diamonds, mind. 
 And it's an engagement ring. You know that? 
 You wouldn't know the size of her finger by any chance? 
 Well, I have a ring of hers here. 
 It's a size too big, Michael. 
 You're going to have to come back. 
 I never bought Rose an engagement ring. 
 When she said yes, I was broke and, er, surprised, to tell you the truth. 
 Engagement rings is powerful important, Michael. 
 Some might say better late than never. 
 The ladies might be more inclined to take them for granted the first time, eh? 
 I hope Mrs. Coyne appreciates the man she's got. 
 Aye. Good luck. 
 I saw the piano. Do you play? 
 I fumble. 
 She's very good. Proper. 
 Do you still play your Mendelssohn? 
 That is all I play. 
 My Grade 5 piece, Song Without Words. 
 Do you know it? 
 Oh, all the songs I know have words, like jive and jitterbug. 
 [THEY CHUCKLE] 
 Is it just me or are the local guys kind of short... and perhaps a tad homely? 
 Michael is anything but homely. 
 Oh, your husband? 
 And he's tall. Tall, dark and handsome and enigmatic. 
 Vera, don't tease. 
 You know, you talk so different from the other Irish folks I've met. 
 Well, I'm English. We both are. 
 Oh, my gosh! 
 How did you fetch up here? 
 In the back of beyond? 
 [HE CHUCKLES QUIETLY] 
 Rose met Michael in Shoreham while he was recuperating from an operation. 
 He was sitting on a bench quietly, spotting a good thing, she pounced on him. 
 Oh, wow. 
 That's kind of what it's like for Ron. 
 There's a line. 
 Not that he notices. 
 Collateral damage. 
 Huh? 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, that wasn't meant to be out loud. 
 Sorry, I was... 
 Go on. We girls are interested. 
 It's when you're aiming your bombs at a target and instead of hitting the target, you hit something that you were really trying to preserve. 
 Hey, we know the phrase, we just want to know why it came into your head. 
 Dessert. I have some poached pears and cream. 
 What a pair of idiots we are. 
 [THEY CHUCKLE] 
 Oh, gosh, what can I say? He is beautiful. 
 And I'm sorry you can't have him. 
 You can't. 
 [ROSE SOBS] 
 Stop. I know. 
 I'm a selfish harpy who's been saved from her own worst impulses. 
 No, you should get on your knees and give thanks every night for your deliverance from evil, Rose, that the curse has been broken. 
 Restroom? 
 Upstairs on the left. 
 Rose. 
 I've wanted to tell you all through lunch. 
 I was ambushed by your sister. That's why I brought Tillie along. 
 I didn't want Vera to get the wrong idea and instead... 
 Stop! 
 Please, please don't tell me that. 
 I thought I was over you. 
 I made a promise to get over you and then I broke it and then I thought I'd been saved despite myself and now... now I'm lost again. 
 Oh, excuse me. I just thought I'd help... bring in the desserts for you. 
 Thank you, Tillie. That's... 
 [MICHAEL CHUCKLES] 
 Poor old Vera. 
 Her eye set on him and it turns out he's got a girlfriend. 
 She must have got in a right gunk. 
 That's not like you, Michael. 
 What? 
 What did I do now? 
 To be callous. She's entitled to look for male company. 
 Did I say she wasn't? 
 I think of it every time I look at her. 
 How will you ever get over what happened to Robert and the babby, Vera, huh? 
 Why did you ask me? 
 What? 
 In Shoreham... on the seafront, that day. 
 I thought you looked like a question that needed to be asked. 
 And no answer, so far, mind. 
 Why did you say yes? 
 I mean you must look around you now and wonder, were you half-sensible? 
 You know, I look at Vera and I see the kind of exotic creature you might have been... at home on the Orient Express or in Italy or any amount of mysterious places with interesting people. 
 Instead you're here... in Moybeg. 
 And I know your heart must often ache for those places and faces. 
 But you've never, not once Rose, tried to make our children disloyal to the raggedy little place they grew up in. 
 Michael... 
 Or to me, a man who does not entirely fill your inner space. 
 I'm not unaware of it. 
 That's why I followed you, Michael. 
 Because you are so much more than "not unaware". 
 You are so clever. 
 So observant, so much better than I deserve. 
 [PLANES OVERHEAD] 
 Thank you, Mrs. Maguire. Thank you very much. 
 Oh? 
 I called to the house. 
 Ration day - this is where I spend it. 
 I just wanted to give you these... 
 Oh! 
 .. for that lovely lunch. 
 They're from Ron as well, of course. 
 Er, Ron. Oh? 
 I forget he's Captain Dreyfuss to you. 
 Yes, of course. 
 That's what he is to me. 
 And how is Captain Dreyfuss? 
 Ron is fine, but busy, busy, busy. 
 Yeah. Colonel Creswell could not run the base without him. Oops. 
 It's classified. 
 [THEY GIGGLE] 
 Will you thank him for the chocolates, from me and Vera, of course? 
 Of course. 
 And, er, I think he may have a plan. 
 Gosh. 
 For a Christmas party with ice cream and sweets and Kris Kringle. 
 Ron might even put on a beard! 
 [THEY LAUGH] 
 I just wanted you to know what was on his mind. 
 If you would like to help me plan things, I think he'd like that. 
 He trusts your judgment, Mrs. Coyne, to a very large degree. 
 Well, I gotta go. 
 [CAR APPROACHES MUSIC STOPS] 
 [MUSIC CONTINUES] 
 Francis, it's Dr Black. 
 Go and tell him Mum's at the shop. 
 I just came to tell you that I'm home. 
 Oh. 
 Gosh. 
 You know, I thought you might call by but then you did, and I was really pleased to see you, but then you just rode straight past me. 
 Well, why would I want to stop, pray tell? 
 Well, erm, I... 
 I thought you might like to help out with the boat. 
 You know, varnishing the... 
 And haven't you a girl to do your varnishing? 
 Eh? 
 Last Friday, the girl who was in the garden with you. 
 Last Friday? 
 [PIANO PLAYS] 
 Are you talking about Beryl? 
 If that's her name, yes. 
 It's a pretty stupid one. 
 [HE LAUGHS] 
 Stop laughing at me. 
 I'm sorry, Emma. 
 Beryl... is my cousin. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, gosh. Really? 
 Yes, gosh, really. 
 Were you checking me out? I... 
 Yes, you were! You were casing the joint. 
 Well, Miss Sleuth, would you like to come to a party tomorrow? 
 Oh. Yes. 
 That's so mean! I've already told Andrew I'll come to the party. 
 I made a promise. 
 You wouldn't make me break a promise, would you? 
 Michael, tell her. 
 Your mother doesn't think it's a good idea... 
 Please make it more convincing! 
 You heard your mother, Emma. 
 Let that be an end of it. 
 Blast. 
 [EMMA SIGHS] 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Auntie Vera. 
 I was packing and I wanted you to have this. 
 It's Penhaligon's Eau de Portugal. 
 Oh, gosh. 
 Lipstick and now this. 
 Do you like it? 
 I bet it's really hard to get. 
 Yes. 
 The shop got bombed. 
 Fortunately, Robert had bought some for me. 
 Don't tell Rose. She'll be jealous. 
 I... 
 I couldn't help but hear what went on tonight, Emma. 
 You're clever so you know what "carpe diem" means, yes? 
 Well, Vera's advice is carpe, Emma, carpe like mad. 
 But, at the same time, try to be... 
 I'd say "be good" except I'm not sure quite what good is any more but it probably includes hurting your parents as little as possible... in this time when everybody is getting hurt. 
 Right, bye, you lot. 
 Emma, the heartbreaker. 
 Francis. 
 [VERA CHUCKLES] 
 There's a big hole in the road at Gourley's corner. 
 The bread man near broke a wheel. I'll be careful. 
 Vera, look after yourself. Till next year, hey? 
 Yeah, till next year. Bye, gorgeous Kate! 
 You can always come and stay for longer if things get too much. 
 Thank you, Rose. 
 I'm not sure how you define too much. 
 Thank you for saving me from myself. 
 Only you know if I did. 
 Be careful, eh? 
 I looked on the dump all day yesterday, till Stagger run me. 
 There's no more of them balloons. 
 Do you think the Hanlons would buy toothpaste? 
 Francis as an adult : So Vera went home and my father breathed a sigh of relief, happy that he'd got the less wild and wayward of the Moorshead girls. 
 In fact, as I now realise, my mother was about to show him that he'd got that wrong. 
 Entirely, hopelessly, disastrously wrong. 
 You have all been invited to a Christmas party. 
 What do you think's up there? 
 There's everything, Francis. 
 Everything. 
 Decency? He's trying to take my livelihood away. 
 See if I can save your pub! 
 Where is he? Why doesn't he love me any more? 
 This is family! This is trust! 
 This is everything I believe in... and it's been thrown in my face.
