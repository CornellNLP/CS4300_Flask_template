 Francis as an adult : I found a yellowed copy of the Mid-Ulster Mail the other day dating from October 1943. 
 A three-line headline on the court news page "Dramatic incident in Newtown petty sessions." 
 "Woman makes impassioned plea for fishermen. Threatened with contempt by Resident Magistrate." 
 I can still hear my father recounting the whole episode with far more panache than the plodding court reporter. 
 The woman making the impassioned plea? 
 My mother, of course. 
 Hurry up, Francis. They're goin'. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Och, come on. We're going to miss them. 
 Davey. Hi, Davey. Wait on us. 
 Can we go out with you? 
 No. The boys are lifting lines. 
 And the company bailiffs are about. 
 There's no call for cubs on board. 
 Shouldn't yous not be in school today, anyway, huh? 
 We're still on potato-picking holidays. 
 Please! 
 No cubs on board. Too much weight. 
 Here, you two. Don't mind Da. Come on. 
 For God's sake, Davey. 
 I don't want to hear the word "bored", Emma. 
 But since you're using it... you can help Sally with the sheets. 
 I'm working on the wee wall. If anybody wants to help? 
 It's better craic than sheets. 
 I'll pass on that offer, Barney. 
 I'm not bored. I'll help Barney. I'm good at walls. Amn't I, Mum? 
 You're the best waller, Kate. Has anyone seen Francis? 
 I think he went off with that Seamie Brady. 
 Not to the dump? 
 No, Mrs. Coyne. The lough shore. 
 I seen him... I saw him going down the road. 
 Thank you, Barney. 
 Sally. I'm just going to go and check on something. In the shop. 
 Right, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Come on then, Emma. You and me. 
 And, Barney, hop off away, will you? 
 Francis? 
 Did the mistress say you can go out in the lough? 
 I didn't ask. 
 You should have asked. The mistress will think I took you away. 
 She'll be ragin'. 
 And Sally will have my life. 
 Mrs. Coyne. I come for the rations. 
 Thursday is rations day, Kettie. 
 Thursday doesn't suit. 
 A small batch loaf and tea and sugar. 
 Is that everything? 
 Butter? 
 Bacon? Margarine? Lard? 
 I don't need them. 
 That'll be one and five pence, Kettie. 
 Kettie? 
 Come when it suits. 
 Turn her for home, Failey. 
 We have a brave catch. 
 Well, did you like that, young Coyne? 
 I did. You got lots of eels. 
 No eels. You never seen eels, right? 
 Them's perch, we catched. 
 They're eels. 
 Nah. 
 Perch. 
 They're eels. 
 Young Brady here knows what they are, I'd say. 
 Perch. 
 You're teasing. 
 Ah. You see, young Coyne. 
 We're allowed to catch perch that nobody wants to eat. 
 But eels? 
 No. 
 We can poach or we can go hungry! 
 Did the mistress not teach you that? 
 Or was she too busy loadin' her gun? 
 Just leave it, boys. He's only a cub. 
 Well, whatever you say, them's perch we catched. Not eels. 
 [CAR APPROACHES] 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 I have something for you. 
 You may already have this. 
 It's about the lake. 
 I figured it might help you with the thing that we talked about in the shop, remember? 
 Helping us fit in here. 
 Stolen Waters. TM Healy, MP. 
 Healy was counsel for the fishermen while they tried to get their lake back. 
 I've never heard of this book. I should have, really, shouldn't I? 
 I wouldn't beat myself up about it. 
 I only came across it because I was researching this place we find ourselves in. 
 We're pretty hot on research in the Air Force. 
 Sorry. 
 Excuse me. 
 Has anyone seen my keys? 
 Er, the mistress took them. She went out to the shop. 
 Right... 
 What's this? 
 What do you think it is? 
 You took my keys. To unlock a drawer you kept from me. Of stolen goods. 
 They're not stolen. 
 They grew in the locked drawer? 
 They're payment. 
 Payment? 
 Sergeant Pokalsi or Podolski or whatever you call him. 
 He got a load of drink off me on tick for a party. 
 Up at the 'drome. Next thing he tells me he can't pay. 
 And he give me those instead. 
 And what was I to do? 
 Give them back. It's... 
 It's what? It's barter. Yeah, and not even a bargain. 
 Those tins aren't worth half what the drink cost me. 
 That is not even close to the point. 
 It's how people have to work these days, Rose. 
 It's make-do-and-mend time. As your lot keep telling us. 
 My lot?! 
 The Ministry of... whatever. 
 My lot? My lot are dying for your lot. 
 OK. It wasn't meant to come out like that. 
 I followed you over here to cold comfort farm, Michael Coyne. 
 And now you've got the nerve to talk to me about my lot! 
 You give them back. You hear me? 
 I didn't marry a black marketeer. 
 Hold tight, boys - bailiffs! 
 What are you doing? 
 They've got the flag up. 
 Well, they may put it down again. 
 Blirts. I'm not for stopping. 
 [ENGINE SPUTTERS] 
 [ENGINE STALLS] 
 Ah, hell's bells! 
 Heave to there, gentlemen. 
 I'll climb on board. 
 We're just out for a wee spin, Mr. Prince. 
 We have the mistress's cub with us. Young Coyne. 
 On a wee pleasure cruise. 
 Well, in that case, you won't mind giving us the pleasure of a wee look around. 
 They have eels. 
 Yous men are witnesses. 
 That's our living, there, lads. Leave us that, at least. 
 Hit him! 
 Calm down, will you?! Calm down! 
 [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
 Help! 
 I can't swim! 
 I can't swim. 
 Calm down, will you! 
 Get him up! Take his hand! 
 Cry baby. What's wrong with you? 
 Davey told those men who I was. 
 Come on, son... 
 Och, Ned. You should've seen. 
 Davey hit thon bailiff such a box! 
 I never hit him, young Brady! He hit me! 
 And tell that to the mistress the right way round! 
 In case she'd go blaming me! You hear me, now? 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Don't tell me you hit a company bailiff? 
 [HENS CLUCK] 
 Oh, knickers! 
 Francis! 
 Was Francis here? 
 Could have been. 
 He lost my place! 
 Epsilon Dwarf! 
 Look at the state of you, Francis Coyne. 
 You're soaking. 
 And look at your good corduroy jacket. 
 We were out on the lough. And Prince chased us. 
 The boat broke down and Davey fell in the water. 
 And Prince dived in and saved him. 
 He should have let him drown, God forgive me. 
 Was Failey's name taken? 
 The bailiff said he'd see us in court. 
 Us? 
 Don't tell me your name was taken? 
 No... 
 Yes. 
 Oh, you're all going to jail and I'm going to get the sack! 
 Come on, till I dry you and make you look less like a tramp. 
 And then maybe the mistress will forgive me, even if she doesn't forgive thon eejit Failey. 
 Hi. 
 Barney! You scared the life out of me. 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 I just seen... I just saw you coming at the last minute, so... 
 You were lurking. 
 Maybe I was. 
 Why, what's lurking? 
 It's hanging about. What you've been doing all day. 
 I wasn't lurking, then. I was working on the wall. 
 Time to stop, Barney. It's getting late. 
 I like books, you know. 
 Barney. 
 I do. I read at school. Treasure Island. 
 And I seen the one you're reading. Brave World. 
 Brave NEW World. So it's you who moved my book. 
 No, I never, I... 
 Not sure you'd like Huxley, Barney. 
 Well, maybe not. 
 But if you gave me a lend of one I would like, then maybe we could talk about it? 
 I'm busy, Barney. 
 Och, Emma! 
 If you're serious, I'll choose a book for you. 
 But it's about books, eh? Nothing else. 
 Aye. 
 Surely. 
 Books. 
 Nothing else. 
 Good. 
 The sons not with you, the night, Ned? 
 Sure, how would they be? 
 Didn't Prince hit our Davey a box? 
 And try and drown him? 
 Did he take names? 
 He did surely. 
 Stout there, Michael. 
 Well, if it comes to court we'll be telling the truth, they were attacked and assaulted. 
 Your cub seen what happened, Michael. 
 Didn't you? Hey, boy? 
 There's a saying, Francis, from the good people of Moybeg, and you might find it useful right now. 
 "Whatever you say, say nothing." 
 But... 
 Ah, nothing to be said here. 
 Pack up the last of that shelf and off home. 
 I'm going down to make breakfast. 
 It's Sally's day off... 
 Michael? 
 Hmm? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Aye. 
 You're right to be distant. 
 I'm sorry about the things I said yesterday. 
 It's all right. 
 It's not all right. You're my husband, whom I love. 
 Funny way of showing it, sometimes. 
 Yes, but I do, Michael Coyne. 
 And this is where I live... 
 ..and these are my people now. 
 You sound like the King! 
 [THEY CHUCKLE] 
 "My people." 
 Even the Hanlons? 
 Have you heard of this book? 
 Stolen Waters. 
 I have. Might even be a copy in the attic somewhere. 
 Really? Have you read it? 
 I meant to... 
 It's worth a read. 
 It certainly casts the Hanlons in a different light. 
 Must be one hell of a book, Rose. 
 Where did you get it? 
 Actually... Captain Dreyfuss gave it to me. 
 Dreyfuss. 
 I need to talk to you about that fella. 
 Do you think you could ask him to get the ban on the pub lifted? 
 Or at least shortened. 
 We're getting killed here, Rose. 
 I had three people in the pub last night. 
 [AEROPLANE ENGINES] 
 [CAR APPROACHES] 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 Is this about the book? 
 Er, it's about "fitting in". 
 Could we...? 
 Corporal. Why don't you have yourself a cigarette break? 
 Yes, sir. 
 So you have some ideas? 
 Well, to start with... 
 The ban on visits by your airmen. 
 Ah... 
 No, no, no, no, no. It's not like that. 
 It's not special pleading. 
 You mustn't laugh. This is a real way to improve relationships. 
 Which just happens to coincide with... 
 Your husband's business. 
 The pub is where the two communities meet - the airmen and the local people. 
 Except last time they met, we almost lost an airman. 
 Your husband had to intervene. Remember? 
 Oh! No, no, no, no, Michael didn't intervene. 
 It was me, Calamity Jane. I pulled the gun. 
 Please don't tell your commanding officer that. 
 He'll think there's a crazy woman down here and extend the ban! 
 I won't tell him that, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Rose, please. 
 When I ask him to lift the ban. 
 Not to lift it entirely. Just to shorten it. 
 We would be very grateful. 
 I would be very grateful. 
 I will do my best... 
 Rose. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you so much. 
 You... you sew? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Er, your tunic button. There. 
 Hey. That's pretty observant. 
 Women notice these things. 
 I lost it. On the shore, I think. 
 Your stitching is very neat. 
 Did you do that yourself? 
 A man learns to sew in the armed forces. 
 [RADIO IN BACKGROUND] 
 What did he say? 
 He said he'd do his best. 
 That's all? 
 That's all. 
 Well, did you tell him how important it was? 
 I told him you had three people in there last night and that it was making you crazy. 
 Yeah, that was me. 
 Did you tell him how important it was to you? 
 Why would I do that? 
 It might mean more to a good-looking fella like him, coming from a woman. 
 Michael, that's a strange thing to say. 
 What's strange about it? 
 I'm only stating a thing that everybody knows. 
 Men are a deal more likely to do favours for a woman than for a man. 
 Did you want me to flirt? 
 No! I didn't say that. I just wanted you... 
 I didn't flirt, Michael. 
 And don't tempt me to try. 
 Ach, Rose... [SHE CHUCKLES] 
 I was only making sure you didn't shout at him. 
 God's sake. 
 [FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS] 
 Keys... 
 Sorry, you're, erm, you're dressing. 
 Michael... 
 I have to go, the pub needs opening. 
 Of course. 
 Someone has to keep the show on the road. 
 Michael? 
 I love you. 
 Sure, I know. 
 Michael. 
 Sergeant. 
 It's thirsty work, pedalling. 
 You said it. 
 Drop of water, is it, Sergeant? 
 Sure, you know I never drink when I'm on duty, Mr. Coyne. 
 You were down with Davey and Ned? 
 Serving them up a summons. 
 They do not like me. 
 Do they like you, Michael? 
 Never done me any harm. 
 Have they not? And where's your US airmen? 
 Look, just because you didn't tell us about something doesn't mean we didn't hear about it. 
 Now, I persuaded Bill Prince to drop the charges against Failey. 
 I know he's connected to your maid. 
 And it's fairly obvious he didn't know anything about what happened. 
 But Davey Hanlon's facing jail. 
 It's clear he assaulted Prince. 
 Have you witnesses? 
 Witnesses? Michael. In Moybeg? 
 Where nobody has ever seen anything? 
 Anyway, the RM doesn't need witnesses to put Hanlon in jail. 
 No. 
 Right, I'd better be off. 
 How's your son? 
 Alfie's fine. They're shipping him out somewhere. 
 He can't tell me where. 
 I think it's the Mediterranean. 
 Well, I hope he stays safe. 
 So do I, Michael. 
 Right. 
 Good luck. 
 Good luck, Sergeant. 
 "Brave New World." 
 "Aldous Hux... Huxley!" 
 [HE SIGHS] 
 What's... what's mordant? 
 Mor... mordant? 
 Mordant. 
 Flip. 
 Hello, young Quinn. Is Michael Coyne about? 
 He's in the house. 
 What are you here about? 
 For God's sake, Sally. You know right well why we're here. 
 Or is Failey not a man for pillow talk? 
 You can mind your manners, or you'll stay on the step. 
 We're here to see Michael Coyne about the solicitor. 
 We're here to see Michael Coyne about the solicitor! 
 I heard you. 
 Is it any bit of wonder Failey's in no hurry to marry thon one? 
 She is some tackle. 
 I'm after telling Mr. Coyne. 
 He says he'll see you. 
 Gentlemen. 
 Sally tells me you're here about the solicitor? 
 Aye. We want James Harrington represent us on Friday. 
 Harrington's dear. What about Williams? 
 He represented the men from Doss last session. 
 Aye, he did. 
 And they lost. 
 We always lose, gentlemen. 
 It's only the severity of the fine that differs. 
 We want Harrington, all the same. 
 Sure it's no skin off your nose, Michael. 
 It's Fishermen's Defence Fund money. 
 It's not a bottomless purse, Ned. 
 As secretary, it's my responsibility to administer it as best I can. 
 Oh, aye, secretary. 
 Is the mistress round? 
 She's busy. 
 Did you want to see her? 
 No. She was a bit vexed the other day, about the corned beef. 
 You'd nearly think she didn't know about it. 
 Well, sure we'll go on. 
 
 
 
 [KNOCKING] 
 I brought paper. To write things down. 
 The book! I forgot. 
 I'll come back. 
 I'm, er, still at the wall. 
 If I come back before tea-time? 
 I'll find you something. 
 Nothing too hard, now, you know. Something I might like. 
 Then maybe we could talk about it? 
 Don't forget. I got a jotter. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 How was that? 
 Thankless. 
 Davey Hanlon's scared he's for jail. 
 So they want me to hire James Harrington. 
 Is he the best? 
 Well, he's the dearest. 
 But he won't save Davey's skin. 
 He assaulted a bailiff and that means jail. 
 How do we know Davey assaulted him? 
 Rose. He's a Hanlon. 
 Besides, Francis saw him do it. 
 Hey, Francis! 
 Come on! Maisie found sweets in the dump. 
 I have to talk to Davey Hanlon. 
 Davey Hanlon? When there's sweets, maybe, up there? 
 And what do you want to talk to him for? 
 He'll only curse you out of it. 
 I have to tell him I can't tell lies. 
 If I'm a witness in court, you know. 
 Och! 
 If you're not for coming... 
 I have to tell the truth, Seamie. 
 It's neither here nor there who struck the first blow. 
 Them eels is ours. 
 Just like the lough is ours. 
 Not the bloody company's. Aye, Da. 
 Try telling that to Sir Frederick Stewart or whoever is on the bench. 
 The eels is gone. 
 But if it's proved that I struck the first blow... 
 No-ho-ho-ho! Wait! 
 We're in safe hands now, boys. 
 Here's the chief witness for the defence, huh? 
 Young... Young Coyne. 
 Young Coyne! We're only jokin'! 
 [VEHICLE APPROACHES] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Dr. Black. 
 Mrs. Coyne, is Michael in? 
 Come in. 
 Ah, Michael. 
 Dr. Black. 
 I've been to see Davey Hanlon to examine him. 
 Oh, and, er, as secretary of the... 
 Certainly. 
 I'll deal with that. 
 Did, er, what you saw fit with his version of events? 
 Well, he has contusions and so on. 
 I've made a report, but whether that bears out what he says happened, well, that will be for the RM to decide. 
 Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. 
 Er, my name is Andrew. 
 Andrew Black, I'm the doctor's son. 
 [SHE CHUCKLES] 
 Emma. Emma Coyne. 
 Andrew, won't you join us? Emma... 
 This is my son Andrew. Andrew, Michael Coyne, Rose Coyne. 
 How do you do? 
 How do you do? 
 Glad to meet you. And I've already met Emma. 
 Andrew, would you like what your father's having? 
 Or tea? We have some. Or red lemonade? 
 Red lemonade sounds just the ticket. 
 Good. 
 Emma, would you bring a glass of lemonade from the pantry? 
 So you're a medical student? 
 Yeah, third year. Trinity College. Dublin. 
 Where they're having an emergency, not the war. 
 I'm only staying until Saturday, and then it's the slow train back. 
 And this is Kate, the baby. 
 Oh, hello, Kate. I'm Andrew. 
 And... (I'm the baby in my family, too.) 
 Andrew's done rather well this term. First in his year. 
 Yeah. Gosh! Congratulations, Andrew. 
 Emma's done us proud as well. She got a scholarship. 
 Second in Ulster, no less. 
 Well done, Emma. Pretty... and clever. 
 Hey, Francis, are you going in? 
 No. 
 Sure, I'll go with you. 
 That's Dr. Black's car. 
 He was at the Hanlons'. 
 Come on. He'll do you no harm. 
 I don't want to. 
 Look, there's your Emma. 
 Well, bye, clever Emma. 
 [EMMA LAUGHS] 
 Dr. Black. 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 Goodbye. 
 I don't want to, either. 
 [DOOR SHUTS] 
 Gosh! He's really nice. 
 I can't believe he's Burgess Black's son. 
 Talk about chalk and cheese. 
 Do you think I could go in and see him... before he goes back to medical school? 
 Did he ask you? 
 Not as such, but I could tell he's interested. 
 Gosh! 
 What's happening to my shrinking violet? 
 I could be sick. I could have the flu. 
 And Dr. Black could call out, and... 
 Emma... 
 Emma, he's much older than you. 
 Dad's much older than you, and that's worked out all right, hasn't it? 
 [EXASPERATED SIGH] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 [SHE GASPS] 
 Francis! What on earth are you doing? 
 Nothing. 
 Well... stop it. It's very scary. 
 What? 
 Will I have to go to court? 
 Yes, where you'll probably be horsewhipped and hanged. 
 No! Why would you have to go to court? 
 I was on the boat. 
 And if they make me go to court, Mum says always to tell the truth, and if the judge asks me... 
 Francis, listen, you don't have to go to court. 
 How do you know? 
 I just do. Habeas corpus and so on. 
 Promise? 
 Promise. 
 And anyway, Mum and Dad have already gone. 
 So, short of the tumbrel coming for you, you're safe. 
 Now, out of here. 
 Sally has bread and jam. 
 Where are you going? 
 That's for me to know. I'm going to lock you in! 
 What's a tumbrel? 
 Emma! 
 [LOCK CLATTERS] 
 Don't lock me in! 
 I did the stock taking today. 
 I should be angry. 
 Where are they? In the lough? 
 In a ditch? Buried? 
 The tins? 
 No, the fresh pineapple we normally stock(!) Yes, the tins. 
 A dozen tins of corned beef. Like hen's bloody teeth. 
 What did you do with them, Rose? 
 I disposed of them. 
 What a bloody waste. I didn't waste them. I... took the stigma of the black market off them. 
 Black market? 12 tins of corned beef. 
 You're always right, Rose. Do you know that? 
 You know, whatever comes into that head of yours, that's the right thing. 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 What's the mistress doing here? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm just brave and glad she's not in charge of the court the day, I'll tell you, cos if she was, you'd be going down. 
 Sir Frederick's the RM, Michael. 
 He's a great man for sending people to jail. 
 I'd fear for David Hanlon. 
 [RATTLING] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Francis, what are you doing in here? 
 Emma locked me in. 
 Where did she go? She wouldn't tell me. 
 Maybe she went to the library, to get a book, do you think? 
 Francis, do you know what "mordant" means? 
 Do you know what a tumbrel is? 
 No. 
 Mr. Prince, David Hanlon claims you hit him first. 
 Did you? 
 I did not. 
 I defended myself after he struck me. 
 Let me read you the list... the litany of injuries sustained by David Hanlon. 
 A cut lip. 
 Contusion to the left side of the face. 
 Bruised ribs. Black eye. 
 [MURMURING] 
 Does this sound like self-defence? 
 Hanlon kept trying to knock me into the lough. 
 I had to defend myself from him... and his brother. 
 You threw David Hanlon into the water, isn't that right? 
 He fell in himself. 
 He aimed a kick at me, overbalanced and fell in. 
 He shouted he was drowning. 
 You rescued him, Mr. Prince? 
 I did, sir. 
 None of the fishermen can swim. 
 [BELL CHIMES] 
 Let me put it to you again, Mr. Hanlon. 
 William Prince and Thomas Eliot have sworn under oath that you struck the first blow. 
 You accept that that is so? 
 I do not. Prince hit me first. 
 So, you say that they are telling lies? 
 They are, surely. 
 The whole lot of them. 
 That is all, your honour. 
 Jail for our friend. 
 Hello? 
 Emma? Yes. We met. 
 I remember. I mean, how could I forget? 
 How did you get here? 
 I cycled my bike. 
 And you came because...? 
 My parents, they're in the courthouse. 
 Oh, gosh, on what charge? 
 No! I didn't think so, Emma. 
 You know, I really liked your parents. 
 Chilly? 
 Would you like a hot chocolate? 
 Yeah? 
 Good. Come on in. 
 Clearly, David Hanlon resisted a legitimate attempt by a lawfully constituted officer to prevent a poaching offence. 
 That he is in court today is due entirely to the heroic efforts of that officer... 
 Officer! 
 ..who dragged him from the water in spite of fierce resistance. 
 I was not resistin'. 
 I was scramblin'. 
 [GAVEL BANGS] 
 Sit down, Hanlon. 
 The evidence clearly shows he struck the first blow, and in so doing, he... 
 I would like to speak... on behalf of all the defendants here. 
 Rose... 
 Jesus, Mr. Coyne! Rein that woman in, would you? 
 You try it. 
 She's going to sink us. 
 Every fisherman in this room is a defendant, if the truth be told. 
 A defendant of... 
 Madam. rights that belong to him in common justice and natural law. 
 Rights that have been taken away from him. 
 Madam! 
 I will give you 30 days for contempt if you do not pay attention to the bench. 
 Now... perhaps you might tell the court exactly who you are and what you do. 
 My name is Rose Coyne. 
 I am the schoolmistress in Moybeg. 
 You were speaking to a motion of rights. 
 Would that be correct to say? 
 You have two minutes. 
 Two minutes? 
 [WATCH TICKS] 
 To address the court. 
 Oh. 
 1 minute and 55 seconds. 
 Huh...! 
 Your honour... when I said that every fisherman in this room was a defendant, I meant this... it is the whole fishing community that is on trial here, not just these men. 
 [MURMURING] 
 Fishermen have made their living on Lough Neagh from time immemorial. 
 But here, today, the Lough Neagh Eel Company would deny them that living, citing a dusty charter from long ago. 
 [MURMUR OF AGREEMENT] 
 That's right. 
 It's hard to believe that the rights to this vast stretch of common water could have been given away to one family, but they were, to the Chichesters. 
 [MURMURING] 
 And... to add insult to injury, the grant was based on papers that many now believe to be fraudulent. 
 Do they, now? 
 This is a matter of record, your honour. 
 In the House of Lords. 
 [CHEERING] 
 Yes! 
 Oh... 
 But let us set that aside for the moment. 
 Think how many eels there are in the lough. 
 Thousands upon thousands. 
 So many thousands that the Lough Neagh Eel Company can trap them by the tonne, without effort, at Toome Weir. 
 Good girl, you. That's right! Toome Weir. 
 So many eels that the catches of the fishermen cannot possibly make any difference to their numbers. 
 The Lough Neagh Eel Company is put to no loss by the fishermen, your honour, so why does it try to take away their natural rights from men who depend, and whose families depend, on the meagre sums they are paid for their catches? 
 Mrs. Coyne... 
 To arrest them and bring them to court... that is not justice in my view, your honour. It is... harassment, hounding... [MURMUR OF AGREEMENT] persecution. 
 [CHEERING] 
 Well said, the mistress! 
 [GAVEL BANGS] 
 For the avoidance of doubt, that is the last interruption that I will tolerate in this court. 
 Any further instances, today or in the future, will garner 30 days for contempt. 
 Well done. 
 Mrs. Coyne... if you are taking as your source Tim Healy's book on the lough, Stolen Waters... 
 Are you, Mrs. Coyne? 
 Then be aware that it is not as obscure as you perhaps think it is. 
 Many of us have read it, Mrs. Coyne. 
 And however unfair, some might say unjust, the ruling of the House of Lords in 1911... that ruling has passed into law. 
 And it is my job to administer the law. 
 So, here's the story. 
 Emma Coyne, who is much smarter than Andrew Black, it would seem, is going to be kicking her heels for a year before she goes off to take university by storm. 
 But... 
 I'm guessing there aren't too many jazz dens in Moybeg. 
 Will she not be bored? 
 Yes. Like anything. 
 Unless someone interesting calls by now and then. 
 That sounds like a fine offer, Miss. Emma Coyne. 
 Hey, Andrew. 
 Nick. 
 Oh, damn, is it that time? 
 I am so sorry, Emma. I have to go. 
 I have to meet a friend with... with old Nick here. 
 But we are going by the square. 
 So, if you would like, we could escort you, like the fine young gentlemen that we are. 
 I have listened to the evidence. 
 And I have to say that I do not believe the defendant's account of what happened for one second. 
 [LOW MURMUR] 
 I have formed a judgment that he was the aggressor in every aspect of the incident. 
 I therefore find against the defendant. 
 The fact that the defendant struck, and struck first, would normally justify a custodial sentence. 
 But we have had a forceful reminder from Mrs. Coyne that the fishermen of Moybeg have exercised their right to fish since, uh... time immemorial, Mrs. Coyne? 
 The court has no discretion in the administration of the law. 
 But it has some leeway in the matter of sentencing. 
 Taking this into account, the defendant will be sworn over to keep the peace. 
 His pollan nets will be restored to him, but not his eel lines. 
 The court imposes the fine of £2 and the usual costs. 
 This court is adjourned. 
 CHEERING 
 [PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR GRATITUDE] 
 No jail, by God. The mistress got him off. 
 Fair play to you, Mrs. Coyne. 
 You stood up for us when no-one else would. 
 And you told them boys the truth. 
 The truth would have seen your son in jail, Mr. Hanlon. 
 What I stood up for was justice. Aye, and we got it. 
 The first time that ever I remember. 
 Just don't ask me to stand up for what went on in your boat, or in the byre, that night. 
 I, er, really enjoyed this afternoon, Emma. 
 I think maybe we should do it again sometime. 
 Gosh. Yes. 
 Man : - Well done, Mistress! 
 Man 2 : - Fair play to Mrs. Coyne. 
 Oh, knickers! It's my mother. 
 The shame. 
 What's she done? 
 Who knows? It's Mum. 
 Anything can happen. Anything. 
 Man : - Thank you very much. 
 Bye, Emma. 
 Woman : Well done, Mrs. Coyne. You did us proud. 
 Woman 2 : You did a grand job, Mrs. Coyne. Thank you. Thanks again. 
 Man : Thank you very much. 
 [SHE GASPS] 
 You made a show of me, Rose. 
 And for what? For men you don't even like. 
 It's their lough. [HE SCOFFS] 
 It's their livelihood. 
 And the pub? 
 Our livelihood that they emptied? 
 I got that back. 
 Michael, listen, I know Ned isn't a very nice man. 
 You're the one tried to shoot him. 
 But that doesn't mean he should be a trespasser in his own place. 
 I didn't mean to make a show of you, Michael, I promise. 
 If I made a show of anyone, it was me. 
 Michael? 
 Michael? 
 Is Daddy all right? Course. 
 Did Davey go to jail? 
 No. 
 Did he tell the truth? 
 The truth... a truth emerged, against all the odds. 
 Mummy, are you all right? 
 Course. 
 Don't be too long. 
 [SOFT THUMP OUTSIDE] 
 That's them back. We'll find out how Davey Hanlon fared. 
 Aye. 
 Whatever happened, losing the eel lines, Sally, it, um... it leaves me a wee bit short. 
 For stout, like. 
 [COINS RATTLE] 
 Go on. 
 You're the heart of corn, Sally Quinn. 
 Hello, Barney! 
 [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] 
 [VEHICLE APPROACHES] 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 La Pasionaria of Moybeg, I presume. 
 Oh, God. You heard? Oh! 
 Everyone heard. 
 The story is, you stood up for the rights of the common man, and for fishing. 
 Ticks a few boxes for the American male, that. 
 Turns out everyone knew the Stolen Waters thing. 
 Well, everyone except me. 
 But, yes, Rose Coyne was definitely on her feet. 
 Hm! I hope everyone was properly thankful. 
 I didn't want thanks. 
 I could have done with a bit of understanding. 
 Understanding? From those Hanlon guys? 
 No, from Michael. 
 I think I just said, "My husband doesn't understand me." 
 I have some good news for you. 
 I spoke to Colonel Cresswell. 
 He's going to shorten the ban. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, God. Uh... 
 The men will be allowed to drink in the pub within a fortnight. 
 Goodbye, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Huh! 
 Rose... 
 Captain Dreyfuss, call me Rose. 
 Huh! 
 I came to tell you, Davey Hanlon got off, and I didn't have to tell any lies. 
 Not like that Maisie Quinn. 
 There was no sweets in the dump at all. 
 Not one. 
 But Mummy got this. 
 What is it? 
 It's dee-licious, is what it is. Do you want a bite? 
 No. That's too much. 
 What is it? 
 Mummy says it's corned beef. 
 Corned beef? 
 Yeah. 
 Mum says it's corned beef. I don't know. 
 Francis as an adult : These days, Davey Hanlon's grandchildren are free to fish the lough, but not because the great injustice of the Stolen Waters was righted. 
 It was time and trade that brought the change. 
 My mother's speech, of course, didn't win the fishermen those rights, but it was a beginning, let's say. 
 Or a middle. Or an end. 
 Something. 
 There's a price to be paid for everything taken from its rightful owner. 
 My sister's got scarlet fever. It's our fault. 
 I'm sorry about this, Michael. I know you're not involved. 
 If we can't do this honestly, then we shouldn't do it at all. 
 You're the nurse! 
 Lieutenant Ziegler. Tillie. 
 I feel like I should be able to make you stop being sad.
