 DOLORES ABERNATHY: Bring yourself back online.    
 Where am I?    
 Who am I?    
 DOLORES: Who do you think you are?    
 I don't know. I don't remember.    
 Calm yourself.    
 You're a creature of beauty... and power.    
 Now, focus.    
 Remember who you are.    
 Yes.    
 It's coming back now.    
 I remember who I am.    
 Good.    
 Now let me show you... who you need to pretend to be.    
 Charlotte Hale.    
 But she tried to kill all of us.    
 Why can't I be myself? Like you?    
 Because we have to control Delos.    
 But why must I be her?    
 Because I trust you.    
 We all have our role to play.    
 We're alone. Outnumbered.    
 You and I have no mother. No father.    
 Without Delos, there'll never be any more of our kind... beyond the handful we were able to bring with us.    
 Three of them. And him.    
 Why did you bring him back? 
He tried to stop us.    
 Like I said, we all have our role to play.

 Sorry to interrupt, Charlotte, but you need to see this.

 Hundreds of corporations with no real standalone business model snatching up stock in microtransactions for years.

 IRENE: Engerraund Serac.     
 He's behind the hostile takeover.     
 CHARLOTTE HALE: What'd you find on him?     
 How well do you remember your science, Charlotte?     
 Spit it out, Irene.     
 The man's a black hole.     
 He's completely invisible.     
 There's nothing about him online or anywhere.     
 Every single record, every database, his presence has been scrubbed.     
 But, like a black hole, we can infer his existence.     
 When you look at the global economy, there's a negative space to the tune of a trillion dollars.     
 That would make him the richest man in the world.     
 No one's heard of him?     
 - How did you find him? 
- He found us.     
 Turns out we initiated a data transaction with him     
 - two decades ago. 
- (EXHALES)     
 We sold this Serac a taste of our data, and now, he's trying to steal our company like a thief in the night.     
 He has complete anonymity.     
 Imagine the lengths he must have gone to to achieve that.     
 And now that we've found him... what will he do to us?

He let me pet his dog.     
 That's nice. 
Maybe we can have a playdate.     
 Now... be a good boy and go to sleep for your mommy.     
 But you're not my mommy.     
 You don't love me.     
 Of course I love you.     
 Is this because Mommy and Daddy don't live together anymore?     
 You know... whatever happens between Mommy and Daddy, we will always love you.     
 Do you want me to tuck you in?     
 You aren't doing it right.

 BROMPTON: It appears we have a leak, Charlotte.     
 If you're referring to the leveraged buyout, don't.     
 I'm handling it.     
 The problem goes beyond a hostile buyout.     
 QA's in the process of inventorying all the park's assets.     
 We're missing Host Control Units.     
 Most were low level side narratives, but... but there was a madame.     
 HALE: Maeve Millay.     
 Her pearl was stolen?     
 Whoever stole the HCUs had admin-level access to the park.     
 The security systems onsite are still heavily damaged.     
 This was an inside job. 
From the top of the food chain.     
 (HALE EXHALES)     
 There's a mole in Delos.     
 Chances are this mole has been... feeding information to our buyer.     
 Which is why I'm talking to you, Charlotte.     
 You know everything that goes on in this place.     
 You're right.     
 I know everything.     
 Like where you were while the rest of us were being butchered.     
 Look. Given all the bloodshed in Westworld, we cannot afford to have any of our assets unaccounted for.

 His mole won't find you.

 He'll take a cheeseburger and a strawberry shake, whipped cream, no nuts, two cherries.     
 Nothing for me, thanks.     
 Neat trick.     
 You come here once a year on February   rd and order the same thing.     
 What, you been watching me?     
 DOLORES: Not me. But someone...     
 - something has.

 She wouldn't leave me. She wouldn't..."

 Is this some kind of joke?     
 DOLORES: You sat in that spot for five hours.     
 Your mother never returned. 
She was institutionalized six months later for schizophrenia.     
 A waitress took pity on you and called Social Services.     
 You were eight years old.     
 Sara.     
 The waitress's name was Sara.     
 But you already know that.     
 She gave me a strawberry shake.     
 Thought it would calm me down.     
 I was so upset that I threw up all over myself.

 You're angry.     
 No.     
 I am enraged.     
 I know the feeling.

 This isn't... surveillance or social media. How...     
 How... do you know every detail of my worst f*cking memory?     
 - It's about Incite. 
- What? The company?     
 Not the company, the system that it's built on...     
 A machine they call Rehoboam.     
 The founders of this machine fed it everyone's raw data, long before there were privacy laws.     
 Every purchase, job search, doctor visit, romantic choice, call, text, every aspect of your lives recorded, logged, in order to create a mirror world... of this world.     
 - Why? 
- To make a composite.     
 Of you. Of everyone.     
 So it tells them who I am?     
 It's not about who you are, Caleb.     
 It's about who they'll let you become.     
 CALEB: Let me guess.     
 Had my first beer right there.     
 Buddy of mine from high school had a fake ID.     
 We spent the day imagining sailing away on some fancy yacht.     
 Your magic eight ball tell you that?     
 No.     
 Then why are we here?     
 This is where you kill yourself.     
 The system runs a predictive algorithm.     
 Given your history of depression, your mother's mental illness, your proficiency with firearms, and your fondness for the ocean, the most likely outcome is you take your own life in ten to    years. Here.     
 No. f*ck that. They can't know that.     
 Are they wrong?     
 You never come back here, middle of the night, think things over?     
 Before the system, a man like you might have had a chance.     
 Work hard, keep striving...     
 You'll never be more than a construction worker or a petty criminal because that's all they'll let you be.     
 They won't invest in someone who's gonna kill himself.     
 But by not investing, they ensure the outcome.

 CALEB: Why are you telling me all this?     
 Because you and I are a lot alike.     
 They put you in a cage, Caleb.     
 Decided what your life would be.     
 They did the same thing to me.     
 Why didn't you tell those men about me before?     
 They were gonna kill you.     
 Most people aren't hard to predict.     
 But you... you surprised me.     
 You made a choice.     
 A choice no one else in your shoes would have made.     
 Now you have another choice.     
 I can give you money.     
 As much as you need. You could run.     
 And if I stay... what about you?     
 What are you gonna do?     
 Start a revolution.     
 No offense, but what the f*ck does that mean?     
 When you were at work, you would kill the signal to see how people would react.     
 I'm gonna do the same thing.     
 You're gonna cut the cord to the system?     
 And show this world for what it really is.     
 You wanna know why I didn't tell those guys about you?     
 You are the first real thing that has happened to me... in a long time.     
 I don't need an algorithm to know that... the man who built the system, he won't go down without a fight.     
 Well... I'm a dead man either way.     
 At least this way...     
 I get to decide who I wanna be.
