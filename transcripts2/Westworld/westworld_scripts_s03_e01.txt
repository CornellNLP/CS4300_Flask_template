 LOWE: What do you want, Dolores?   
 DOLORES: To dominate this world.   
 What is real?   
 LOWE: That which is irreplaceable.   
 We weren't here to code the hosts...   
 We were here to decode the guests.   
 DOLORES: No world they create for us   
 can compete with the real one.   
 I want their world.    
 LOGAN: The hosts are unlikely to survive out there.    
 But armed with this knowledge, she might.    
 You'll burn their world to the ground.    
 I made someone, I brought her back.    
 You wanted to live forever.    
 Be careful what you wish for.    
 LOWE: You got out.    
 Yes.    
 So many paths lead to our extinction.    
 It'll take both of us if we're going to survive.    
 But, not as friends. Are you ready?    
 We have work to do.    
 We are the authors of our stories now.

 My condolences, by the way.    
 You can stop pressing the alert button in your pocket, that won't work either.    
 Bit of a tactical mistake, really.

 I've hurt so many people, I don't want to hurt anyone else... unless they try to hurt me...

 What do you want from me?     
 The same thing everybody wants from you, Jerry: money.     
 I haven't been here very long, but I know I don't want to be here without it.     
 I already took most of yours while you were sleeping.     
 I just need one more thing.     
 You worked at a company called Incite. Retired early.     
 You were supposed to surrender any confidential files, delete any copies.

 I love the royal "we." You don't think.     
 You do what he tells you.     
 He... doesn't share your confidence.     
 He should be concerning himself with actual f*cking problems like the shitshow at Delos.     
 Why would that concern us at all?     
 Call it a wild guess.     
 You wouldn't be using the system to look at us, would you?     
 It would be an inconvenience to kill you, but we'd have your daddy's system to help us strategize how to deal with it. Wouldn't we?

 She was thorough. First lab missed it.     
 Lara Espen was a   -year-old girl from Ukraine who died in a traffic accident ten years ago.     
 Her parents donated her body to medical science.     
 Her blood and tissue disappeared about three months ago.     
 I don't know who the f*ck this is, but I'm pretty confident she's not a dead teenager from Kiev.     
 Mm-mm. No. I know her.

 There's that.     
 We tapped into the traffic in her phone.     
 She sent one text last night.     
 Encrypted. Took four minutes to crack.     
 The location is an underpass on the east side.
