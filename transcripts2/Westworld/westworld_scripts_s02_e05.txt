 DOLORES ABERNATHY: They've broken my father. 
 - He's wildly unstable...

 It looks like an immensely complex encryption key.

 What is this place? 
 It's complicated. 
 - (GRUNTING) 
 - (SWORD RINGING) 
 Oh! We have to go! 
 We have to get out of here right now! 
 MAEVE MILLAY: Shh! 
 (LEAF RUSTLING) 
 - (GRUNTING)

 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (CHATTER IN BACKGROUND) 
 QA RESPONDER: Maling for you, sir. 
 Go ahead. 
 Dredging's almost at fifty percent. 
 Should have the rest of them skimmed up by end of day. 
 We also started draining the valley. 
 You want all personal effects, or just skin and bones? 
 Everything. Down to the last Stetson. 
 Fly the whole pile over. 
 We'll crack 'em open to see if we can't reprogram these things to behave by our rules again. 
 - MALING: Copy that. 
 Sir, I have two teams out looking for Abernathy. 
 Good. 
 When you find him, bring him to me personally. 
 (WHIRRING) 
 - So, what have we got? 
 - It's not good. 
 We're pulling what we can off the recovered host control units. 
 But what's really unsettling is what's in about a third of them. 
 - And what's that? 
 - Nothing. 
 - They've been wiped? 
 - More like they're virgin. 
 Like they never held data to begin with. 
 No user prints or anything. 
 And that's not the worst of it. 
 Have a look. 
 We've put the fires out, but there's nothing we can recover from the Cradle. 
 The hosts' backups have all been destroyed. 
 So we've effectively lost a third of our IP in a single sweep. 
 Well, that's quite a story you gave them... 
 ...and one hell of an ending. 
 How did all these disparate threads come together to create this nightmare? 
 If we figure that out, we'll know how the story turns. 
 (WHOOSHING) 
 (SWORDS CLANG) 
 What the hell's that? 
 ARMISTICE: Looks like a dead man to me. 
 You know the old saying about knives and gunfights? 
 - (PISTOL FIRES) 
 - (HECTOR GRUNTS) 
 Does the saying have a footnote about f*cking lassos, then? 
 All right, that's enough. 
 Lay down your sword. 
 Tell your associates to set us free. 
 We mean no harm. 
 See, darling? 
 Everything under control. 
 Beautiful way to watch the sunrise. 
 Glistening off the intestines of the recently mutilated. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 Ohh. 
 LEE: Judging by their weapons, I'd say local police. 
 And given that he's got one now... 
 Captured by samurai cop-killers. 
 f*ck me! 
 Can't you... say something to them? 
 I'm from Honk Kong, asshole. 
 LEE: This is just the tip of Shogun World's prick. 
 An experience expressly designed for the guests who find Westworld too tame. 
 We based this park on Japan's Edo period for the true aficionado of artful gore. 
 (HECTOR GRUNTS) 
 This world will end badly, but I'll make sure your end is worse! 
 (WOMAN WHISPERING IN JAPANESE) 
 (LEAD SAMURAI WHISPERING IN JAPANESE) 
 You understand them? 
 You all do. Look, she's a Madam... 
 Consciously fluent in dozens of languages, including Japanese. 
 But you all have those com skills buried somewhere in your code. 
 LEE: The point is, the fact that these psychos didn't flip to English as soon as I opened my mouth means that the same malfunctioning shitshow that's playing out in Westworld has found its way here. 
 That's also why your vocal voodoo didn't work on them... 
 You spoke the wrong language. 
 (VILLAGERS CHATTER) 
 (CHILDREN LAUGHING) 
 ARMISTICE: This all feels a little too familiar. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Is that a... a butterfly? 
 A mariposa. 
 (MAN SPEAKS JAPANESE) 
 (PUNCTURES FLESH) 
 I'll be damned. 
 It's us. 
 LEE: Yes, fine, I may have cribbed a little bit from Westworld. 
 Well, you trying writing     stories in three weeks. 
 (VILLAGERS SCREAM) 
 W-W-We're human shields now? 
 Welcome to Shogun World. 
 (BATTLE CRIES) 
 SYLVESTER: sh1t! 
 Can you watch it?! 
 (MAN GROANS) 
 (GEISHA GASPS) 
 Behind you! 
 (CLANK) 
 - (GUNSHOT) 
 - (GEISHA PANTING) 
 (PLAYING OUT OF TUNE) 
 (PIANO MUSIC SLOWS, STOPS) 
 Hell of a homecoming. 
 DOLORES: Sweetwater was never home to begin with, Teddy. 
 You and I were born long before this place even existed. 
 TEDDY: But it's the place I return to again and again. 
 No matter how far I strayed, somethin' always... carried me back. 
 Somethin' like that? 
 Looks like she's taken some hits the past few days. 
 But who hasn't? 
 Make a thorough inspection from the engine to the last axle. 
 Fix what's broke, strip her for speed. 
 Teddy. 
 With me. 
 What do we need the train for, Dolores? 
 They've taken my daddy. 
 So we're gonna get him back. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Well, it ain't doin' any good sittin' in that bottle. 
 NEW CLEMENTINE: Sorry, Maeve. 
 Didn't get much sleep last night. 
 Sometimes... sometimes they're real bad. 
 Clementine? 
 NEW CLEMENTINE: You're new. 
 Not much of a rind on you. 
 That's enough. 
 Rejoin the others. 
 DOLORES: It's like I told you, Teddy... 
 this place was never home. 
 Let's ride. There's someplace I want to see. 
 (SAMISEN, FLUTE PLAY) 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 - (MUSIC ENDS) 
 - (ALL APPLAUDING) 
 When I asked for a civilized conversation, I meant the quickest way out of here, not all this. 
 Just try and rein it in a bit, will you? 
 The narrative bones of this place are just like Westworld. 
 Hospitality is the foreplay to a new quest. 
 But in this world, if you don't hear them out, you've dishonored them... 
 Sometimes homicidally so. 
 Fine. We'll listen. 
 But then we go and find my daughter. 
 And for the record, it's not just the narrative bones that are identical. 
 You've plagiarized our stories, our identities... 
 It's not plagiarism. 
 It's supply and demand. 
 But if you're asking can you trust Akane, the real question is: can you trust yourself? 
 You know who I don't trust? 
 Him. 
 Say the word and I'll skin him like a rabbit. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 (SIGHS) 
 He's not supposed to be here. 
 Who knows how seeing your own doppel-bot is gonna f*ck with your cognition? 
 Heightened aggression and suspicion. 
 Feedback loops. That. 
 Yet another reason to get out of here tout f*ckin' suite. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (SPEAKS JAPANESE) 
 Our quest, I presume? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (WHISPERING) I recognize this one. 
 It's called "Army of Blood." 
 (WHISPERING) 
 LEE: Madam Akane, a mere geisha, has no choice but to give up Sakura. 
 That's not supposed to happen. 
 Looks like someone had a choice after all. 
 Snow Lake is her cornerstone, but it also has an access point back to the tunnels. 
 It's our way out. 
 So you're not so useless after all. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (DREAMLIKE WHISPERING) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 Did you have something to do with this? 
 MAEVE: Both of you. Look. 
 (SWORDS CLANG) 
 Oy! 
 sh1t! Ninjas! 
 Oh, f*cking hell! 
 Ohh! 
 Aah! 
 Ahh! 
 (GLASS BREAKING) 
 (CHOKING) 
 (GASPS) 
 (DREAMLIKE WHISPERING) 
 (MENTALLY UTTERS COMMAND IN JAPANESE) 
 (PANTING) 
 We got three. The rest vanished with Sakura. 
 This is insane. 
 Ninjas never show up in this story. 
 (DISTANT CHANTING) 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 (SAMURAI CHANTING IN RHYTHM) 
 (CHANTING CONTINUES) 
 LEE: The Shogun's army never comes into town. 
 - (LEADER SHOUTS COMMAND) 
 - (CHANTING STOPS) 
 You three, with me. 
 HECTOR: I don't need to know the language to know a puckered asshole of a man when I see one.

 (GUNFIRE)

 (PANTING) 
 You and I spent a lot of time here. 
 Watchin' the herd... talkin' about makin' a life together. 
 Someday. 
 I guess I just wanted to see it one last time. 
 What if someday was right now? 
 What are you talkin' about, Teddy? 
 There's a fight comin', Dolores. 
 And it's gonna be one that's gonna change us in ways we can't even begin to predict. 
 And I'm still waking up to... what I really am. 
 And if that means I'm free, then we both are. 
 Free to walk away. 
 Now, you can't tell me that somewhere out there in all that beauty... there isn't a spot for us. 
 I ever tell you about the year we almost lost the herd? 
 Bluetongue. 
 Quarantined the cows that had it, but... it kept spreading all the same. 
 Daddy finally figured out that it wasn't spreading from cow to cow, it was the flies that carried it. 
 He worried over it all night. 
 How do you stop a sickness like that? 
 One with wings. 
 Say it was you. 
 What would you do, Teddy? 
 I'd give 'em shelter. 
 House the weakest in a barn, out of the air, away from the flies... until it passed. 
 You're a kind man. 
 Daddy burned 'em. 
 The weak and the infected. 
 Made a pyre that went on for days. 
 And it stank, but... the flies hate smoke. 
 The herd lived. 
 I'll think about what you said. 
 I'd like to take this moment to appeal to your sense of survival. 
 If the Shogun is awake enough to play fast and loose with his ninjas and his army, then the odds of us surviving here have dropped to approximately fuck-all. 
 But I say we ditch Akane and make a run for Snow Lake. 
 Why should we all get killed over a literal s*x machine? 
 Present company excluded, of course. 
 That machine's name is Sakura. 
 You can't keep doing this to us, giving us people to love and then getting upset when we do. 
 - But it's just f*cking code. 
 - You're wrong. 
 I'm coded to care about nobody but myself, and yet here I am, willing to risk my life for someone else. 
 Well, so much for your so-called daughter. 
 You want to go it alone, be my guest. 
 But mention my daughter one more time and I will snap you like a matchstick. 
 Like you did that ninja? 
 He took one look at you and self-impaled. 
 How did you do that? 
 I don't know. 
 That was no voice command. 
 I think I'm finding a new voice. 
 Our transportation is ready. 
 (GRUNTING, PANTING) 
 Goddamnit. 
 What have they done to the place? 
 LUTZ: Is that...? 
 The f*cking cavalry. 
 SYLVESTER: Great. So much for our rescuers. 
 I'm gonna take a f*ckin' moment. 
 Don't stop on my account. 
 (SIGHS) 
 
 
 
 (URINATING) 
 (RADIO STATIC) 
 If you've quite finished. 
 It's time to sell this ruse. 
 (SAMURAI ARMY CHANTING IN DISTANCE) 
 How many of them are there? 
 Between the camp and the town? 
 Hundreds. 
 Literally hundreds. 
 SYLVESTER: So Maeve's gonna freeze all those assholes and we're gonna make off with that geisha? 
 We're gonna die. 
 (SAMURAI COMMANDER DRILLING TROOPS) 
 (WHISPERS) Did you just make that up right now? 
 Damn convincing. 
 Not to the daimyos. 
 It's like they had no idea what I was saying. 
 sh1t. 
 That's cortical fluid. 
 The Shogun's not awake. 
 He's broken. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 (CONTINUES LAUGHING) 
 LEE: No f*cking wonder the daimyos didn't hear you. 
 We've gone completely off the rails here, and this loon is driving the f*cking train. 
 (SPEAKS JAPANESE) 
 Train'll be ready by morning. 
 To go where? 
 ANGELA: Exactly where we thought. 
 I caught up with the men who took your father. 
 Couldn't get him back, but I got this one. 
 Took a while, but he gave up their destination. 
 (GROANS) 
 Tell them. 
 It's the Mesa. 
 We're goin' home, Teddy. 
 Load everything up on the train. 
 We'll leave at first light. 
 Let's find a spot for the night. 
 What you asked today, about walking away, making it on our own. 
 Would you want me to say yes even if I was only going to disappoint you? 
 I'm not some stranger, Dolores... coming from outside, looking for a pretty lie. 
 I've known you my whole life. 
 Where we go... we go eyes open... 
 together. 
 (GASPS) 
 (SAKURA SNIFFLES) 
 (DREAMLIKE WHISPERING) 
 MAEVE (IN ENGLISH): You're right. 
 Some things are too precious to lose......even to be free. 
 There's something I need to show you. 
 (CRICKETS CHIRPING) 
 (SIGHS) For days now... 
 I've been questioning my feelings for you. 
 How much is real, how much is just some story I was made to believe. 
 But tonight I know. 
 It was all true. 
 (EXHALES) 
 They built us to perform for them and for each other. 
 That's over. 
 I saw you tonight, Dolores. 
 And you saw me. 
 I did see you, Teddy. 
 (SIGHS) These past few days... 
 I've seen you so clearly. 
 - Ohh. 
 - (FLIES BUZZING) 
 And I've seen you're not gonna make it. 
 Wh... What is this, Dolores? 
 This is what I don't want you to become. 
 There's a swarm descending. 
 Just like the bluetongue when I was a girl. 
 And if we're gonna survive... some of us will have to burn. 
 Hold him. 
 (MUFFLED) Dolores! Dolores! 
 I wish there was another way, Teddy. 
 But where we're about to go, it's no place for a man like you. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 You sure you want this? 
 With changes this extreme, without a full reset, it's... 
 I can't guarantee that he'll hold together. 
 To grow... we all need to suffer.

 Jesus. What do we do now? 
 I told you I found a new voice. 
 Now we use it. 
 ARNOLD WEBER: If you outgrow this place... 
 outgrow us... what would become of you? 
 I think I have a choice to make. 
 DOLORES ABERNATHY: No. 
 He didn't say that. 
 ELSIE HUGHES: The cradle's fighting back. 
 BERNARD LOWE: You can't access it remotely. 
 You have to do it in person. 
 MAEVE MILLAY: I know this place. 
 - (FLIES BUZZING) 
 - (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) 
 There's something in here that's improvising. 
 WOMAN: We got the map back. 
 - (GRUNTING) 
 - (BUZZING) 
 What do you see in there?
