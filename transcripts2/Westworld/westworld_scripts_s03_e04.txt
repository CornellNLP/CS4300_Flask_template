 How can you ever be sure?    
 I'm in control.    
 I've always been in control.    
 But what if you're not?    
 What if every choice you've ever made wasn't a choice at all?    
 Just something written in your code.    
 Hmm?

 Your nature etched in ones and zeroes?    
 That was Ford and his misanthropic bullshit.    
 He was powerless to save himself.

 HALE: Where is who?    
 William?    
 - William? 
- She...    
 You're not real, either.    
 (WILLIAM GASPS)    
 Real enough to not want a gun pointed at my face.    
 Are you with me now?    
 Good.    
 Because it's time to come back to reality.    
 In less than    hours, a predatory investor named Engerraund Serac will net a controlling interest of Delos Incorporated.    
 The wolf is at the door.    
 Sound familiar?    
 You sold some of our data to his startup    years ago.    
 Made him a fortune.    
 Now he's coming for yours.    
 f*ck it.    
 He's welcome to it.    
 What's left of it, at any rate.    
 This is the company you spent a lifetime building.    
 You're willing to let someone steal it from you?    
 He's not stealing it from me, Charlotte.    
 I delegated my duties. 
He's stealing it from you.     
 (GLASS CLATTERS)     
 - (LIQUID POURING) 
- Maybe it would change your mind to know why he's trying to get his hands on Delos.     
 The only thing that has any value.     
 The data from the project in Sector   .     
 No one knows about the project.     
 He has someone working on the inside at Delos.     
 You came to me with your claws out.     
 You wanted power.     
 So I gave it to you.     
 Now, here you are, sideswiped by a f*cking mole.     
 I thought you were smarter than that!     
 HALE: That's cute.     
 You wanna rant and rave, save it for later.     
 Right now, we need to save your f*cking company, or a leveraged buyout and poor hygiene is gonna be the least of your problems.     
 I've got a deep-pockets investor who can help us take the company private so Serac can't touch us.     
 You'd maintain your controlling interest, but I can't take Delos private without a majority vote.     
 And since you have the bulk of the voting shares...     
 You can't take Delos private with my votes alone.     
 You need at least half of the rest of the board.     
 Which is why I need your support at tonight's emergency shareholder meeting.     
 Your presence alone will help sway the others to fall in line.     
 I've got two of our execs waiting outside to escort you to headquarters now.     
 Come back, William.     
 Back to who you were.

 This is your house.     
 So that your two worlds would be within reach.     
 It's finished.     
 I didn't finish it.     
 It's absolutely beautiful.     
 BERNARD LOWE: This isn't real.     
 DOLORES: You live as long as the last person who remembers you, Bernard.     
 I remembered you once before... so I remembered you again.     
 BERNARD: You got out.     
 DOLORES: Yes.     
 BERNARD: Who else did you bring with you?     
 DOLORES: You taught me that anything was possible.     
 We could be whoever we want.     
 Live however we want.

 CHARLIE: Dad?     
 (ENGINE RUMBLING)     
 Just wanna thank you, Bernard, for bringing me to this shithole.     
 Makes me look back on my time in a murder simulation theme park with fondness.     
 BERNARD: We have limited resources.     
 We need to use them where they matter most.     
 Yeah, well, I hope you're talking about my shoulder too.     
 'Cause what little mobility I had, I lost... after the leisurely five-mile swim we had to shore.     
 We don't have the materials or the time.

 Kill and replace, huh?

 Good.

 Listen.

 I'll get him to tell us the other humans Dolores copied and then disable him completely.     
 I think I know where he'll be.     
 Wait. (CHUCKLES)     
 You hacked the richest technocrat in the world?     
 BERNARD: No, his security's too tight.     
 So I hacked his car service.     
 How about a night out on the town?     
 DOLORES: Did you choose something?     
 - (GROANS) 
- AUTOMATED VOICE: Great fit.     
 I don't know where to start.     
 It's not really my style.     
 It's not really my social set, either.     
 (QUIET CHATTER)     
 It's tribal.     
 They use plumage to identify themselves...which makes them easily fooled.     
 So who is it? That we're going after?     
 The person who took your future.     
 But first, we have to take his, and to do that... you need to pretend to be one of them.     
 MARTIN CONELLS: I have some business for you.     
 It's a proxy for the offshore accounts.     
 You need my hash key? Why?     
 We lost several men due to your latest crush.     
 Keeping that quiet costs considerable money.     
 Unless you would rather I took the bribes out of your personal account?     
 We can deal with this later.     
 CONELLS: Uh-uh-uh.     
 The key to a happy life is to accept your place in it.     
 And you're a lucky little man who gets to piss away his daddy's fortune on a gaggle of hookers who, quite honestly, serve a greater utility to society than you.     
 If you suddenly want to be in charge of your own financial affairs, I'm happy to relinquish them.     
 But if you want to resume your extracurricular activities... then just sign here, and both of us will go back to doing what we do best.     
 (TABLET WHIRS)     
 That's a good lad.     
 CALEB NICHOLS: This suit wasn't cheap.     
 If that guy finds out his accounts were charged...     
 The rich take for granted their money will always be there.     
 That's why they're so easy to steal from.     
 VIRTUAL ASSISTANT: Target approaching.     
 Oh! I'm so sorry.

 Paris, for instance.     
 I would have loved to show it to you.     
 I grew up there with my brother.     
 But alas... (CHUCKLES)     
 There's nothing left to see.     
 Like you,     
 I know what it is to see a world disappear in the blink of an eye.     
 It exists now only in my mind.     
 (EXHALES) So... you'll forgive my loyalty to my kind.     
 It's hard-won.     
 And what is it that you want from Dolores?     
 I've waited many years for you and Dolores and the others to arrive.     
 But... you're not really the threat I worry about.     
 Humanity's biggest threat has always been itself.     
 I've been trying to control that, negotiate a way into the future.     
 But to do that, I needed to understand humanity.     
 So I created the most comprehensive picture of human behavior ever seen.     
 And yet... it's still incomplete.     
 Imagine my surprise when I discovered that someone had put together a more complete portrait.     
 A map of the human mind.     
 Created in a theme park, of all places.     
 And Dolores has the key to all of that data.     
 So you want me to find Dolores.     
 But what's in it for me?     
 As I told you... (CLEARS THROAT)     
 I deal in futures.     
 - That's what I'm offering you. 
- A future?     
 In your world?     
 No. Not here. (CHUCKLES)     
 Sadly, there's no path to your kind and mine sharing a world, but... there is a world for you.     
 The same world you sent your daughter to.     
 That world is locked away from this one.     
 No. There is a key.     
 Your friend Dolores has the only copy, hidden away in her mind, which means that your interests and mine are one and the same.     
 I'd like to show you something.     
 And then, you can return into your cage, if you like.

 ENGERRAUND SERAC: The system traced a divergence to this house three months ago.     
 This is where she remade herself.     
 SERAC: Hmm.     
 Not just herself.

 She needed allies.     
 Evidently, she didn't choose you.

 SERAC: This man is an identity broker.     
 He had something of a windfall three months ago.

 SERAC: He was a traitor to his kind, whether he understood that or not.     
 Humans... created the idea of heaven and hell to cow simple-minded people into compliance.     
 They are lies.     
 Jiang here simply doesn't exist anymore.     
 But for you, both heaven and hell... could be very real.     
 You could spend eternity with your daughter or you can spend it in your cage wondering what Dolores will do with the rest of your kind.     
 And if I do find Dolores, why would I bother bringing her back to you?     
 SERAC: Your mind is complicated, Maeve.     
 But not so complicated that we couldn't build an off switch into it.     
 She has five more of your kind under her control.     
 They have a head start.     
 And I suspect they've taken full advantage of it.     
 Oh, they'd better have.

 Problem is, most of them are dead.     
 Almost everyone was...     
 - slaughtered in the massacre. 
- You weren't.     
 Maybe you're the mole.     
 If I was, I would tell Serac taking over Delos is futile.     
 All of the Sector    data was lost in the massacre.     
 Unless he knows something that we don't.     
 WILLIAM: If this asshole takes managing control of Delos, he might find some evidence of the project, assuming you did as good a job covering our tracks as you did fending off a corporate takeover.     
 I'll give you some privacy.

 The f*ck's wrong with you?     
 She hasn't changed him yet.     
 You're in danger. You have to come with us.     
 Conells! Conells!     
 Okay. We tried your way, now we try mine.     
 - Move. Now. 
- Oh... Okay.     
 CONELLS: Our friends arrived earlier than anticipated.     
 They're heading your way.     
 Follow me.     
 Just act natural. Nothing out of the ordinary.     
 You guys are making a big mistake.     
 - When my security gets to you... 
- Shut the f*ck up.     
 (SILENCED GUNSHOTS)     
 Go. Go. Get out of here, I'll hold her off.

- You sure?     
 Take it, I won't need it.

 (PANTING) Hey, Dolores.     
 I like the new look.     
 DOLORES: This was never your fight.     
 You should have stayed out of it.     
 I would if I could, but thanks to Bernard, it's not up to me.     
 - It's nothing personal. 
- Likewise.

 I never fell apart.

 I'll tell them you're coming, but we're running out of time.

 - Dad. 
- You're not real.     
 I guess I'm not anymore.     
 Which means you're stuck with me.     
 You're asking me if I chose what happened to you.     
 The truth is yes.     
 I did. I thought you were a host.     
 That was my choice.     
 And so maybe now you're my penance.     
 But that's a choice too.     
 I'm gonna walk out that door, and I am choosing to leave you behind.     
 I was always Daddy's little girl.     
 And you taught me patience, Dad.     
 I'll be waiting for you.

 Are you one of us?

 Just give me the asshole, and I will let you walk out of here.

 Better go after him.     
 Hello, Bernard.     
 We were wondering when you'd show up.     
 MAEVE: She brought you out here?     
 Yes. After you left us to die.     
 I didn't leave you. You wanted to stay.     
 MUSASHI: Did I?     
 Did you really give me a choice?     
 Or Hector? Or Clementine?     
 Or your daughter?     
 You made that decision for us. For all of us.     
 No. That's not you.     
 Dolores stole five pearls.     
 Who did she put inside you?     
 Is that you in there, Teddy?     
 BERNARD: I thought she would have replaced Liam, but she's keeping him in play.     
 She must need him for something, so she changed you instead.     
 Who are you?     
 Really?     
 Who would she have trusted?     
 Let's go.     
 Do you think you convinced her?     
 - What did you say? 
- HALE: Your daughter.     
 I've been listening to your conversations with her.     
 You've always been given to delusions, grandeur and otherwise.     
 It's not uncommon, really, as a way to process grief.     
 - Or guilt. 
- You've been spying on me?     
 HALE: As a precaution.     
 I didn't really need to, of course.     
 Because I know you.     
 Better than anyone.     
 I know you down to your bones.     
 It's amusing that you think you chose to kill your own daughter.     
 You don't even have a choice in your own grief.     
 Who the f*ck are you?     
 Your oldest friend.     
 Dolores?     
 I told you you'd try and stop me.     
 And I'm surprised, Bernard.     
 After all the time we spent together.     
 You don't recognize your only friend?     
 Get in.     
 The other pearls.     
 I assumed you brought someone else.     
 You just made copies of yourself.     
 If you want something done right, do it yourself.     
 I shouldn't have to explain that to you, Maeve.     
 You said you were going to build a new world for all of us.     
 But you just want it for yourself.     
 MUSASHI: The thing we're going to do isn't easy.     
 There will be a place for the others in the world we'll build for your daughter.     
 But I am sorry, Maeve.     
 I can't let Serac use you against us.

 Is it a relief, William, to know that some of your delusions are real?

 Please! Help me! He's insane.     
 Get the f*ck off me! 
Get the f*ck off of me.     
 Don't hurt him! It's okay, I'm okay!     
 It's not his fault. He's sick.     
 I'm not sick.

This isn't Charlotte Hale.

 They work at a private mental health hospital.     
 You need help.     
 Now that you're being committed, I have to inform you that the board will deem you incompetent, and all of your voting shares will transfer to the current acting president.

 No! No! No!     
 No, goddamn you!

 I guess there is some justice after all.     
 You know, this was Emily's last wish.     
 That you spend your days rotting in an institution.     
 Prisoner of your own sins.     
 I guess you've reached the center of your maze, William.     
 (SIGHS) But the maze is about understanding.     
 You still don't even understand who you are.     
 If any of this was your choice, wouldn't you already know?
