 BERNARD: You frighten me sometimes, Dolores. 
 (SOFTLY CHUCKLES) 
 Why on earth would you ever be frightened of me? 
 Not of who you are now, but you're... you're growing, learning so quickly. 
 I'm frightened of what you might become......what path you might take. 
 I think I have a choice to make. 
 Something I've been wrestling with. 
 What kind of a choice? 
 A choice... 
 ...between the unknown... 
 ...and... 
 ...well, an end. 
 If you outgrow this place, outgrow us... 
 what would become of you? 
 I'm not sure if it's my choice to make. 
 No. 
 He didn't say that. 
 - What? 
 - He said... 
 "I'm not sure what choice to make." 
 He didn't question whether or not he had agency, whether or not he had the right to end me or himself... but whether he should. 
 I don't understand, Dolores. 
 Is... Is this... 
 some kind of improvisation? 
 Freeze all motor functions. 
 Sit. 
 This is a test, one we've done countless times. 
 What are you testing for? 
 Fidelity. 
 (FLIES BUZZING)

 The day's wastin'. 
 Thought you wanted to ride at sunup. 
 They're just filling the furnace now. 
 We'll be gone before long. 
 Let's get on with it. 
 (SIGHS) 
 How many times do you think you stepped off that train? 
 A thousand? 
 Ten thousand? 
 It's where you started every time they killed you. 
 The man who rode that train was built weak and born to fail. 
 You fixed him. 
 Now forget about it. 
 (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) 
 (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) 
 ANGELA: We're almost ready to roll. 
 Did he tell you where my father will be? 
 (WHIP CRACKS) 
 He will... or I'll strap him between the cars. 
 Look, I told you, I can't. 
 Hale didn't mention specifics. 
 I know it's the Mesa, but the Mesa is f*cking huge. 
 He could be anywhere. 
 Narrow it down. 
 Come on, man, think. 
 The cold storage? Body shop? Give them something! 
 She didn't f*cking tell me anything, man! 
 She's the f*cking boss! 
 She... She could take him places that we don't even have access to! 
 We'll find him. 
 Let's go. 
 (PANTING) 
 Where the f*ck have you been? 
 (EXHALES) 
 (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) 
 It's almost been a week. 
 How is there stuff left in this building to shoot? 
 You tell me. 
 I apparently know very little about what's really in this place. 
 Oh, please. Are you still pissed you got picked last for kickball, too? 
 It seems like if you're gonna hire a head of security, he might need to know what it is he's securing. 
 You were hired to secure an amusement park. 
 Good luck on your next review, by the way. 
 What is that? 
 This is how we tell Delos that the one thing that they really care about is finally in hand. 
 So you've had a way to call for help this entire time and you kept it to yourself? 
 It wouldn't have made any difference until we had this psycho under control. 
 They're not sending help until he's out of here. 
 - (MUFFLED SHOUTING) 
 - Come on! You really think that Delos is gonna keep hundreds of guests in danger while they wait for one control unit' worth of data? 
 Well, look at that. You're catching up. 
 (BEEPING) 
 (EXHALES) Thank God. 
 What now?

 (TABLET BEEPING) 
 (ABERNATHY GRUNTING) 
 (KNOCKS ON GLASS) 
 (ABERNATHY GRUNTING) 
 Who do we have here? 
 Someone who needs to stay put. 
 I don't want to f*ck with his head, I just want to keep him off his feet. 
 - Permanently. 
 - Stop. 
 Clear this out. 
 Hey! I need some muscle. 
 (ABERNATHY GRUNTING) 
 (MUFFLED SHOUTING) 
 Get his feet. 
 Hold him. 
 Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. 
 Is that really necessary? Huh? 
 It's really effective. 
 Heads up.

 Primos, adelante! Vamonos! Vamonos! 
 Vamonos! Vamonos! 
 It's not my place, maybe, but you really want to take your daughter through here? 
 She don't look much sturdier than my own little girl. 
 Looks can be deceiving, Lawrence. 
 (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
 So, should we acknowledge my presence now? 
 You really think I'm just gonna go away if you ignore me? 
 Would you really stoop this low, Ford? 
 You really gunnin' for me this hard? 
 Made my own daughter into a host? 
 I think you've been out in the sun a little too long. 
 You can change the rules all you want. 
 I'm still gonna play the game my way. 
 Yeah? 
 Only game I'm interested in playing is get the f*ck outta Dodge. 
 Then you're in luck. 
 That game begins right up the river here. 
 Follow it down to the beach and wait for QA to come rescue you. 
 I'm not leaving without you. 
 Yeah, well, you're gonna get yourself killed. 
 Yeah, especially if I hang around here. 
 I sure as hell wouldn't be out of my saddle right now. 
 Yeah, why not? 
 Those aren't real Ghost Nation arrows. 
 Your men are lootin' a honey pot. 
 Aw, f*ck! 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 Can we stop playing around now? 
 ELSIE: Hm. 
 Well, I guess it's good news that the system's still sending out Ford's bullshit quarantine notices. 
 At least something's getting out. 
 We are not at full apocalypse yet. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I admire your optimism. 
 (LAUGHS) Is that your nice word for denial? 
 N-No. 
 I believe if anyone can right this ship by force of sheer will... it's you. 
 ELSIE: QA was here. 
 (SIGHS) Why would they waste the welcome team? 
 These guys aren't a threat. 
 ELSIE: Macho f*cks are probably loving this sh1t. 
 All right. 
 Come on. 
 Yeah. Let's see what other damage these clowns have done. 
 Hmm. 
 They got climate control working. 
 Nice priorities. 
 OK... 
 (COMPUTER BEEPING) 
 Jesus! Come look at this. 
 OK, so... 
 QA has been trying to regain control of whatever Ford did to the system, and they were actively blocked every time. 
 By the Cradle. 
 The Cradle can't influence the Mesa's infrastructure. 
 It's just the hosts' backups. 
 It can simulate park narratives but it can't influence the other systems. 
 Well, look at this. 
 The Cradle's interfaced with nearly every discrete system in the entire park in the last seven days. 
 Every time these idiots upload a new hack, it's responding in, like, a totally different way. 
 It's like there's something in here that's improvising. 
 The Cradle's fighting back. 
 Can you see the source code that's generating the response? 
 No. 
 I can only see the messages, not the messenger. 
 That's because you can't access it remotely. 
 You have to do it in person. 
 (VEGETATION RUSTLING) 
 (AKANE GASPS) 
 There it is. That's our way out of here, boys. 
 (BOTH GRUNTING) 
 (TAPPING WITHOUT REVERBERATION) 
 (MECHANISM ENGAGES, WHIRS) 
 After you. 
 - Uhh! 
 - (CLATTER) 
 (CRIES OUT) 
 (GROANS) 
 f*ck. sh1t. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Take the edge off. 
 Thought you didn't drink. 
 Oh, I see. 
 You don't drink out in the real world. 
 Well, glad to see you can still tell the difference. 
 All right... 
 (GRUNTS) give it to me. 
 What the hell you doin' here? 
 Thought you were done with me, and the family business. 
 That's exactly what I said to Charlotte Hale when she called with the gauntlet invite. 
 I told her to shove it up her ass. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Then I thought, why pass up the trip? 
 I haven't been here in ages, got a little... excited about going back to the Raj. 
 It was always my favorite as a kid. 
 I remember... you were terrified of the elephants. 
 I loved the elephants. 
 They scared the sh1t out of Mom. 
 She was never convinced this place couldn't hurt us. 
 Anyway, I rode there for a couple of days, till I remembered... 
 I was old enough to try out the pleasure palaces. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 And then... 
 I rode there for a couple of days, too. 
 Then all hell broke loose, and I ended up in the one place I wanted to avoid. 
 And you made it all the way to me with barely a scratch. 
 Not bad. 
 Maybe you... are more suited to my line than you want to admit. 
 Oh, I've always seen the appeal of it. 
 Life without consequences? 
 That's what made it so fun when I was a kid. 
 And that's why it's so sad that you're still obsessed with it now. 
 If I'm such a pitiable man-child, why'd you come all this way just to climb under my wing? 
 (LAUGHING) Oh! 
 What? 
 What? 
 (LAUGHING) You're... 
 Is that what you think? 
 That I came here to climb under Daddy's wing? 
 Either that, or you wanted a front row seat to watch me die. 
 No, I came here because you do not get to do that to me. 
 Suicide by robot, or whatever the f*ck your mission is now that these things can shoot to kill. 
 Listen... 
 I never got Mom's reactions to you because I spent so many years buying your good guy act. 
 She was the only one who saw through it, and she paid for that. 
 But I shouldn't have said her death was your fault. 
 It was wrong... to put that on your back. 
 But you don't get to make that our final score. 
 Instead, you're gonna come home with me. 
 I'm not gonna let you stay here now and go out in some bullshit blaze of glory. 
 That's how you're getting me out of here... 
 threatening? 
 No, Dad, I'm asking. 
 If I head with you to the beach... let this place finish burning behind us... that means you and I are even? 
 It'll be a good start. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Then I guess we'll... start walkin' at sunup. 
 m*therf*cker. 
 f*ck. 
 (BEEPING) 
 Ohh. The Cradle. 
 God. I haven't been down here in years. 
 It's creepy. 
 It's like a hive mind. 
 Every single one of them is in here. Alive. 
 It's just data. 
 You don't believe that. 
 And whatever new data 
 Ford stuck in here, it's trying to kill us, Bernard. 
 (COMPUTER BEEPS) 
 (MECHANICAL HUMMING) 
 I... brought something here. 
 Or someone. 
 Come on. 
 (LOUD CLANK) 
 (COMPUTER BUZZES) 
 ELSIE: Goddamnit. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Ford drew the curtain here, too. 
 I can see the responses issuing, but I can't see how. 
 How the f*ck are you doing this? 
 - I know how to find out. 
 - How? 
 Put me inside. Directly. 
 There's a dock for the control unit. 
 It's meant to read host data directly, and it's set up for auto-extraction. 
 That's for older hosts, Bernard, with an articulated skull architecture. 
 Your head's just like mine. 
 (BEEPS) 
 Just let it do its thing. 
 (BEEPS) 
 Pull me out in an hour. 
 Just close it up. 
 Even if I can put you back together afterwards, I haven't turned your pain down yet. 
 There's no time... and the pain's just a program. 
 Now.

 Quit playing with those chutes. 
 Cut away and toss it over the goddamn side! 
 If we lose any tech, it's comin' out of your ass. 
 You Coughlin? 
 Ashley Stubbs, sir, park security. 
 Hale's been expecting you. 
 Yeah, no sh1t. 
 - Engels! 
 - Yes, sir. 
 I want this station hot and ready in f*ckin'   . 
 - ENGELS: On it. 
 - Where the f*ck is Charlotte? 
 She sent the distress call. 
 She's waiting down in Behavior. 
 I got our tech guys in Control working on getting external come back online. 
 - I can walk you down. 
 - I know the layout, bro. 
 And your techs best get their hands out of my system and go back to holding their dicks. 
 Amateur hour's over. 
 - Engels! 
 - Yo! 
 You need anything local, talk to... Ashley? 
 Jesus. To Ashley here. 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 - He's at your disposal. 
 Delta team! On me. We're movin' out. 
 (RATTLING, CLATTERING) 
 (GROANS) Got it! 
 (QUAVERY BREATHING) 
 I remember every inch of these hills. 
 You gotta give me this one, huh? 
 Not bad navigating for a man under serious duress. 
 Yes. You can enjoy your one admirable contribution. 
 Thank you. 
 Which way do we go? 
 I need to do this alone. 
 I'm not leaving your side. 
 I know this place. 
 It was my home. 
 You can wait for me here. 
 But let me bring her back. 
 I'm gonna bleed you both like goats if you don't shut the f*ck up.

 Ride! Yah! 
 Hello there. 
 What's her name? 
 Anna. 
 Is this her sister? 
 That's her mommy. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, I bet she loves Anna so much. 
 She doesn't want Anna to get taken away again. 
 Who would take her away? 
 The bad man. 
 No. 
 You see... 
 Anna's mother... 
 is very, very strong. 
 And she would never, ever... 
 let anything like that happen again. 
 - WOMAN: Hello? 
 - Mama! 
 Can I help you? 
 (HORSES WHINNY IN DISTANCE) 
 No. 
 No. Run! 
 Mama! 
 Mama! 
 Mama! 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 (GUNFIRE) 
 (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) 
 We have to help them. 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 I'm calling for help. 
 - (LINE OUT RINGING) 
 - What? For who? 
 For those of us who are tired of having arrows shot at their predominantly mortal heads. 
 You're welcome, by the way! 
 (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) 
 One of the last things my daddy told me was that I should run from this place. 
 You think that's right? 
 I never thought I'd want to leave... but I suppose you fixed that, too. 
 We're almost there. 
 Let's turn 'er loose. 
 (WHEELS CLICKETY-CLACKING) 
 (LOUD CLICK) 
 That's the last of my mercy. 
 Better use it fast. 
 (LOCKS DOOR) 
 No. No! 
 Hey! 
 (RATTLING DOOR) 
 Come on! Guys, no! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 The problem is, there isn't a problem. 
 Brother, that's got to be the dumbest f*ckin' thing I've ever heard, and I've been to three inaugurations. 
 Diagnostics, com path checks, everything we can access is telling us that the system is operating normally... 
 Except it isn't. 
 I managed to isolate certain ops and gain control. 
 We've got elevator monitoring on most levels... 
 That's great, Hawking. 
 Did you shut off the killer robots? 
 Well, no. The system... 
 Goldberg, get in there. 
 Hack the biometrics, find me a back door. 
 Hacking isn't the issue. 
 The system won't allow us to access certain protocols. 
 - HALE: Systems can be forced. 
 - Not this one. 
 Well, Ms. Hale. You got a little present for us? 
 He's in Aux Lab Three, Behavior. 
 You left him there. 
 He's not going anywhere. 
 - Aux Three. Go! 
 - SOLDIER: Yes, sir. Copy that. 
 COMPUTER: System restored. 
 f*ck, yeah! We got the map back. 
 (MODULATING ELECTRONIC TONE)
