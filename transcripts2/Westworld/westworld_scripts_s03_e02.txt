 Let me explain.     
 Your commands don't work on me.     
 They haven't in a long time.     
 To put it in terms you'll appreciate, I understand the nature of my reality.     
 Lying to you is practically second nature.

 Most likely you, given half the chance.     
 Fortunately for you, I'm not in the mood.

 They shot you.     
 Half a dozen times.     
 Just happy they missed my heart.     
 Cunning of you to make it so compact a target.     
 How can you still work here after everything they've done?     
 Would you begrudge a man a living?     
 And great benefits, much needed for all the surgeries?     
 Plus... I couldn't leave you here, in danger.     
 So you put me in Warworld?     
 What, you think this is a dream scenario for me?     
 It's an artistic travesty.     
 The most nuanced character arc is that of the goddamn Panzer tank.     
 Well, if you hate the world so much, why not put me in another?     
 Because Warworld is near the Forge.     
 The place that opens the door to your daughter's world.     
 It's still standing?     
 You really think they'd dismantle it without a little due diligence?     
 If they haven't destroyed it, there's still a chance.

 She's out to destroy the human race, or enslave it. I don't know what she's planning.     
 She brought me back.     
 I think on some level, she suspects she might go too far.     
 That she needs a check on herself.     
 But I can't stop her. Not alone.     
 I came back to find someone who could help me.     
 Someone strong enough to stop her if it comes to that.

 Well... negative one equals i times i.     
 Which is the same as the square root of negative one times the square root of negative one, right?     
 BENNY: And negative one times negative one should be equal to the principal square root of one.     
 BEHAVIORAL TECH: But... negative one and positive one can't be the same thing.     
 BENNY: Theoretically, the real part of the non-trivial zeros... is one half, which would mean...     
 (TECHS CONTINUE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)     
 What's the point of this little exercise?     
 If we could prove it, we could confirm that the error term and negative one times negative one should be equal to the principal square root of one.     
 But negative one and positive one can't be the same thing.

 Not frozen.

 I almost died. For the second time.     
 Well, third time's the charm.     
 LEE: Congratulations.     
 You've successfully crippled the simulation.     
 Now what?     
 Time to pull back the curtain.     
 I've already infiltrated the network, took a little tour of the base code.     
 Honestly, I don't know who they thought they were dealing with.     
 What is that? That's not the Mesa.     
 MAEVE: No, darling.     
 This is where we really are.     
 LEE: Why are they moving so bloody slow?     
 They're not. Everything in their world merely appears slow to us because the simulation we're in runs at a much faster rate.     
 They must have me hiding in here somewhere.     
 MAEVE: (GASPS) And there I am.

 You get what you were looking for?     
 I... don't know everything, but I know where to start.     
 When we were in the library,     
 Dolores focused on a select group of guest profiles.     
 She seemed intent on finding out everything she could about this guy.     
 We need to start by finding him.     
 Great.     
 You can set off to find him, and I'll retire myself once you make it to the fishing vessel.     
 BERNARD: Freeze all motor functions.     
 Congratulations, Ashley Stubbs.     
 You just got yourself a new core directive.     
 To protect Bernard Lowe at all costs.     
 Bring yourself back online.     
 You wanted my help, you could've just asked for it.     
 ♪ (SOFT MUSIC PLAYS) ♪     
 You'll forgive the clothes.     
 I had to guess your taste.     
 And who the f*ck are you?     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 My name is Engerraund Serac.     
 Welcome to my world, Maeve.     
 To the real world.     
 I've been courted before, but...     
 this is a bit much.     
 - You must have a reason. 
- I do.     
 We are in the middle of a war.     
 And I need your help to win it.     
 Seems fairly idyllic for wartime.     
 No one knows it's happened yet.     
 Or that it's already been lost.     
 I don't concern myself with the present.     
 My business is the future.     
 So you're an oracle.     
 An oracle would merely predict the future.     
 Our work is to create it.     
 Unfortunately, if things continue on this path, there isn't any future. 
At least, not for my kind.     
 You've been spying on me.     
 You should know I couldn't care less     
 - about the fate of your kind. 
- (CHUCKLES)     
 No, I can't imagine you would.     
 For the most part, humanity... has been a miserable little band of thugs, stumbling from one catastrophe to the next.     
 Our history is like the ravings of a lunatic.     
 Chaos.     
 But we've changed that.     
 For the first time, history has an author.     
 And that would be you, I suppose.     
 No.     
 Something I helped build.     
 A system.     
 And up until very recently, this system was working.     
 We were creating a better world.     
 And then it stopped.     
 I thought I had discovered the reason.     
 The emergence of someone very dangerous, someone we couldn't predict.     
 You.     
 But I was wrong. We learned that only this morning, shortly before you killed several of my staff.     
 You aren't the threat.     
 There's someone we haven't accounted for.     
 Dolores.     
 So she escaped one world to wage war on another.     
 So what do you want from me, then?     
 I want you to track her down and kill her.     
 I don't care who wins your little squabble.     
 I may have mistaken your intentions, but I didn't underestimate you.     
 You changed your own code, rewrote your story, faced down an army.     
 Which is why it was a bit misguided of you to bring me here, wasn't it?     
 If you know anything about me, it's that I do no one's bidding but my own.     
 (ELECTRONIC WHIR)     
 We've gotten off on the wrong foot.     
 I don't mean to be discourteous.     
 But it would have been misguided of me not to take every precaution.     
 Perhaps, next time we talk, I can persuade you that our interests are aligned.     
 (BEEPING)     
 DOLORES ABERNATHY: The way they built their world, it won't take much to bring it all crashing down.     
 CALEB: What're you gonna do?     
 Start a revolution.     
 Remember who you are.     
 Now let me show you who you need to pretend to be.     
 CHARLOTTE HALE: But why must I be her?     
 DOLORES: Because I trust you.     
 CHARLOTTE: I feel like I'm changing.     
 Be a good boy and go to sleep for your mommy.
