 SERAC: It turns out that building a god, as your ancestors can attest, is not easy.    
 More than anything, we needed data.    
 Which meant we needed him.    
 Dempsey was rich, arrogant.    
 He had been in the right place at the right time, before the privacy laws.    
 And now his company, Incite, had the entire world's data.    
 LIAM DEMPSEY, SR.: It's not. f*cking. Working.    
 I paid a king's ransom for this thing, fed you yottabytes of Incite's data, and for what?    
 You've iterated half a dozen versions,    
 Saul, David, and now this one.    
 - What the f*ck's its name again? 
- Solomon.    
 Well, I'm not sinking another dollar into this giant steel ballsack while it's spitting out false predictions.    
 JEAN MI SERAC: Not false.    
 It rendered the last few decades accurately, predicting past events with certainty.    
 DEMPSEY, SR.: You built a machine to predict the f*cking past?    
 Well, let me try. Eighteen months ago, I made the worst business decision of my career by trusting you idiots.    
 Keep staring at that thing, Liam, your brain's gonna turn to mush like these two.    
 What about strategizing the future?    
 That's what you promised.    
 Societal trends, the stock market, a f*cking oracle!    
 (SPEAKING FRENCH)    
 No, I'm sorry. I'm pulling the plug.    
 Come on, Liam.    
 SERAC: What Dempsey didn't understand was that it was working.    
 My brother had done it.    
 He created a god.    
 But such is the case with all great minds.    
 He was uniquely brilliant, but also, uniquely troubled.    
 (INHALES)    
 SEBASTIAN: I have news, sir.    
 But not good.    
 If it's news, it's unexpected, which is never good. What is it?    
 SEBASTIAN: Rehoboam analyzed the traffic coming out of the Yakuza facility.    
 It found a connect between encrypted devices in Jakarta, Berlin, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.    
 - The one in LA is a problem. 
- Why?    
 It came from inside    
 Liam Dempsey's personal compound.    
 - Find Dempsey. Now. 
- We've tried, sir.    
 Rehoboam logged him entering a private function.     
 Now he's missing.     
 - And, sir...

 CALEB: Keep walking.     
 We have all of his money. 
What do we need him for?     
 DOLORES: Access.     
 We need to study our adversary, past, present, future.     
 To do that, we need access to the deeper layers of the system.     
 LIAM: (SCOFFING) You expect me to give you access?

 You're not even in the system.     
 You're a blank space.     
 You've become complacent, believing those let you understand everyone.     
 It doesn't matter.     
 You can't take me anywhere he won't find you.     
 - He's already looking for you. 
- And you.     
 Serac knows by now that you're trying to outbid him on Delos.     
 I'm what?     
 We can help.     
 If you give us your private key,     
 - we can unlock the system.

 You'll never get in. 
My access isn't enough.     
 You'll need to connect at the node, bypass onsite security.     
 Either we find a way to defeat him together, or we all die.     
 Then I guess you die.     
 I'll take my chances.

 Have you asked yourself what she's using you for yet?     
 Let me go, I'll make sure you're taken care of.     
 You already took care of me.     
 You sent me off to war... slaughtered my friends on the battlefield.     
 What do these tell you about me now?     
 What, that I swallow my own gun on some beach?

 SERAC: My brother and I built a system that worked.     
 But Dempsey wanted to see proof.     
 So we started with something simple, purely mathematical.     
 The stock market.     
 We showed him all the major indices,   minutes in the future...  and where it could close that night.     
 Which number is it? Low or high?     
 Which one do you want?     
 (CHUCKLES)

 We stole five million.     
 Last week.     
 SERAC: He didn't really understand what we'd made, what you were.     
 But we did.     
 He only saw the money he could make.     
 But we realized the power of it, that you could reshape the world.     
 My brother and I, we charted a course for the entire human race.     
 Humanity's story had been improvised.     
 Now, it was planned     
 years in advance.     
 For a time, the sun and moon aligned.     
 We brought order from chaos.     
 And then, as with all the best laid plans, it began to fall apart.     
 Dempsey became greedy, drove outcomes to benefit himself.     
 So we locked him out of the system.     
 But there was a bigger problem.     
 In every projection, the world came unglued.     
 There were people, outliers, agitators, who you couldn't predict or control.     
 And I realized that my brother was one of them.     
 He didn't fit the world anymore, and the world didn't fit him.     
 And it drove him mad.     
 What now?     
 (PASSENGERS CHATTERING)

 I can't let that happen.     
 No, you've gone too far.     
 I can't be a party to this.     
 You'd be content to let history continue to play out, just as it has done for centuries, the same f*cking misery repeated over and again when we have a chance to stop it?     
 What the f*ck is that?     
 I'm gonna tell everyone what Rehoboam saw.     
 What you've done.     
 The trouble is, Rehoboam ran millions of projections.     
 Every scenario in which you inform the public about my trials ends in human extinction.     
 This is why my brother wanted to kill you.     
 I looked, too.     
 And I know you let me walk away from here.     
 I would tend to agree with the system, but, see, there are little white spaces, rare moments when randomness interacts with your life, that create a truly free space where you can make a choice.     
 A bubble of... agency.     
 SERAC: And that is how you came to be, mon ami.     
 My brother and I brought you into this world, and now I've ensured that you will outlive us both, that the strategy will succeed.

 RICHARD LEWIS: Jonah was adamant about having a kickass car chase.     
 I tried in my conservative logistic sense to pair it down, and every time I did, he went, "Nope. Jack it back up".     
 We shoot a grenade and it comes back and blows up a car.     
 CG explodes. We did a practical version of it, and we wound up doing a CG takeover of that.     
 Utter chaos. (LAUGHS)     
 Downtown L.A., closed off, Hope Street, Grand, upper Grand, lower Grand.     
 Had some of the great stunt drivers.     
 Really nice piece that we made. It was wonderful.     
 LISA JOY: Episode    , it's an idea that Jonah had been kicking around for the longest time.     
 He wanted to play with genre, and we had a way into it with the limbic system.     
 JONATHAN NOLAN: Cognition, meta-cognition, human emotion.     
 We already manipulate them with different classes of drugs that push one chemical up, push it down.     
 You think about psychopharmacology now, the limbic implant is our all-purpose idea for how you eliminate and entire branch of medicine and replace it digitally.     
 You take a piece of digital medicine that essentially, it's a license, it's not even a chemical.     
 What made sense to us about that was that it would be prescribable, it would be a physical thing.     
 JOY: Brilliant Aaron Paul really having fun with the experimental style on a Gonzo road trip through hell while spinning out on drugs.     
 The craziest drug trip of your life.     
 From horror to suspense to action to romance.     
 That was a lot of fun to shoot.     
 The whole episode was just so insane.     
 JOY: Casting Vincent Cassel was a no brainer.     
 I actually remember on the phone talking to him about the character.     
 He's intelligent, he's beguiling, he's charismatic, and he's powerful.     
 And he said, "I can see why you wanted to cast me".     
 He has a magnetism to him as a performer and an intelligence that you really wanted in this role.     
 Almost godlike in his understanding of the world.     
 VINCENT CASSEL: People will really have a vision of what could happen with the world and how they can make it better.     
 I've listened to those people speaking about their ideas and trying to figure out what kind of character because you cannot be too snob even though you're out of society, but you still think for the people.     
 Engerraund Serac.     
 He knows everything about all the datas of the world, and he knows how to centralize all that.     
 That's how he wants to control the world.     
 We're going to open their cages.     
 EVAN RACHEL WOOD: When I realized what Dolores's plan was,      I thought this is the greatest act of anarchy that I think I've ever seen on television.     
 Everyone can see their entire life is playing out exactly the way the system has set it up.     
 And it feels like all of their choices have been a lie.     
 And I think that's a moment where we don't know exactly how to feel about Dolores.     
 There's a lot of things that she does where we're constantly questioning is she the good guy or the bad guy?     
 It's that question of well, "What does a revolution really look like?"     
 And, "What has to happen for us all to be free?"     
 I think these are all the questions that we're gonna be constantly asking ourselves when we watch this season.
