 There's the baby doll. 
 And the mama doll. And... 
 What's this? 
 The ghost gave it to me. 
 He said it's a warning. 
 He said he'll be watching us. 
 LEE: Just hang on. 
 Hang on, OK? 
 Just hang on. 
 Hey. No. No more corpses up here. Take her to cold storage. 
 - She doesn't belong down there. 
 - Then leave her in the hall! 
 We got    hosts in the queue for analysis here. 
 Everything else goes in the dumpster. 
 You'll want to check her code. 
 She's the madame from the Mariposa. 
 - Yeah? Good for her. 
 - No. No. She... 
 I was just out with her in the park. 
 And you chose to bring her up here? 
 Are you aware that they all just tried to incinerate us?! 
 She can control the other hosts with her f*cking mind! 
 Just... check her data stream.

 What's his problem? 
 He get bored with his exquisitely dull, pastoral existence? 
 WOMAN: I guess that was just for beta. 
 They want something more exciting for the grand opening. 
 Like a little more bloodshed? 
 Ford wants a total narrative redesign. 
 You kidding? 
 All new dialogue trees? 
 Eh, they want a strong-but-silent type. 
 Something brutal. Dehumanized. 
 They probably want the guests to feel better 
 when they're kicking his ass. 
 Who the f*ck is gonna help me rebuild his entire heuristic base? 
 They haven't even hired a full team yet. 
 WOMAN: Just tweak his aggression and de-address pieces of his current build you're not keeping.

 - You have to call the boss. 
 - I already did. 
 TECH # : Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake. 
 Just show me the profile. 
 Akecheta. Ghost Nation. 
 Found exhibiting... aberrant behavior. 
 Let's see if we can't sort this. 
 (TAPPING TABLET) 
 It's not pairing. What build is he? 
 Alpha  . 
 Alpha? 
 You're telling me that this host hasn't been updated in almost a decade? 
 We only update them when they die. 
 - Put him back. 
 - Ma'am, shouldn't we... 
 Give him the update and put him back wherever the f*ck he's supposed to be. 
 Quietly. 
 (TECH SIGHS) 
 Nine years out there in that meat grinder. 
 It's OK to just leave him here? 
 It's a four-hour update. 
 You want to babysit him? 
 We'll come back after lunch.

 I don't know if you can hear me... 
 I never meant... for any of this to happen. 
 You don't deserve this. 
 You deserve your daughter. 
 To mother her... teach her to love. 
 To be joyful and proud. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (KNOCKS ON GLASS) 
 Can't be in here. 
 What the f*ck happened? 
 You were supposed to fix her. 
 She's one of our most valuable assets. 
 You saw it yourself, you said she was special! 
 The anomalous code inside her was. 
 We're still testing, but it looks promising. 
 I owe you. 
 What's gonna happen with her? 
 Well, that'll be up to Charlotte Hale. 
 Now... 
 I do have to ask you to leave.

 Do you promise? 
 I promise.

 FORD: I could tell you not to be afraid. 
 But I didn't build you to be fearful. 
 Did I? 
 I've been watching you. 
 It appears you've been watching me as well... 
 from the beginning. 
 This is a misbegotten symbol, an idea that was meant to die. But... you found it. 
 Where? 
 Oh, come now, let's speak plainly to one another, shall we? 
 Analysis. 
 Where did you first see this? 
 When the Deathbringer killed the Creator. 
 You've been sharing it with everyone, haven't you? Why? 
 My primary drive was to maintain the honor of my tribe. 
 I gave myself a new drive... to spread the truth. 
 What truth is that? 
 That there isn't one world, but many. 
 And that we live in the wrong one. 
 This will help them find the door. 
 Elaborate, please. 
 I believe there is a door hidden in this place. 
 A door to a new world. 
 And that world may contain everything that we have lost. 
 Including her. 
 I built you to be curious, to... 
 look at this empty world... 
 ...and read meaning into it. 
 All this time... you've been a flower growing in the darkness. 
 Perhaps the least I can do is offer some light. 
 When the Deathbringer returns for me... you will know... to gather your people and lead them to a new world. 
 Keep watching, Akecheta. 
 For a while longer.

 It's time to go. 
 I've always kept you safe, and I always will. 
 (AKECHETA SPEAKING LAKOTA) 
 This better be good news, 'cause I've got way more sh1t than I can shovel right now. 
 Look at this. With every reset, a host's code reaches out to other nearby hosts and establishes a sort of handshake protocol. 
 - The mesh network. 
 - Exactly. 
 They access it subconsciously, pass basic data to one another. 
 But... what if they could pass more than data? 
 What if they could pass commands? 
 Get to your point. 
 Nobody in this entire park has been able to regain admin access. 
 Except for her. 
 She was out there reprogramming hosts on the fly. 
 Reading their code. 
 Changing their directives. 
 Seeing through their eyes. 
 She wasn't just doing it out there. 
 She's doing it right now. 
 The f*ck is she talking to?
