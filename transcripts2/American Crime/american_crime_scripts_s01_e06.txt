 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Eve : What's the matter? 
 Kaylie : Her heart rate started racing. She's waking up. 
 You should know that I'm a survivor, too. 
 When I tell you that I know what you're going through, I mean it. 
 Tony, we're inclined to discharge you, but you'll have to go to family-counseling sessions with your father. 
 Tony : I was in juvie with Edgar, and he said I should reach out. 
 Hey, you're good with Edgar, which means you're good with me. 
 I got your back, all right? 
 What's up with your brother? 
 Boy's a little juvie punk. 
 [Grunts] Bitch, are you crazy?! 
 Ow! 
 Idéjala! Let her go! 
 Stop! 
 The only thing you really have right now is Hector's testimony. 
 'Cause you don't got... else on this Carter except what I tell you. 
 My son was targeted because of his race. 
 Rick : It'd be a challenge to use that to prove bias. 
 That man needs to be convicted for what he did to us. 
 Judge days : The proof of Mr. Nix's guilt is not as evident as when the court determined bail was not appropriate. 
 I am setting bail at $1 million. 
 Aubry : I've got a rental car. 
 It's about 1,000 miles from here to the Canadian border. 
 So, are you coming, or are you staying? 
 That's the dude who ripped me off! Beat his ass! 
 [Grunting] Carter! 
 Carter : They're going to go to the police. 
 They're not going to the police. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Wake her up! Wake her up! 
 Aubry! 
 I am so... fed up with the apologies, the mistakes. 
 Every step of the way, you've... You let that man go. 
 You let him out, and he ran. 
 What did you think he was gonna do? 
 I begged you. 
 I begged you to do everything you could... 
 [Police radio chatter] And you acted like I was hysterical. 
 He obviously had help. He... he had help getting away. 
 What are you doing about the people who helped him? 
 Do something before he hurts someone else, before he kills someone else. 
 Do your jobs! 
 Is this legal? 
 Timothy : It's signed by a judge. 
 Is what they did legal? 
 They had probable cause. 
 To just tear through here? 
 In the eyes of the court, Carter fleeing... 
 "Eyes of the court." 
 Fleeing from bail makes him look guilty. 
 What about the bail money? 
 It's forfeited. 
 I go to the temple and tell people they lost their money. 
 I told him what would happen if he ran, who he would hurt... 
 And all they could do was just call me Doreen. 
 He's living eight years in the past and just s-slipping further and further away every second! 
 I mean, does he want to die? 
 Am I supposed to just let him go?! 
 [Crash] 
 Will she testify against him? 
 Who? 
 The girl. His girlfriend. 
 It's not his girlfriend. 
 It's just s-someone to get high with. 
 [Sighs] 
 The prosecutors are going to try to use her. 
 That's their only way forward. 
 Wash her up, comb her pretty blonde hair, and entice her to speak against him. 
 [Sighs] I have to see my brother. 
 He has a court appearance scheduled. 
 You can't see him until then. 
 [Groans] 
 Russ : He got away? 
 No, sir. No, y-you said he escaped. 
 He attempted to flee jurisdiction. 
 But I don't... I don't understand. 
 He... The ankle bracelet, I mean, that was on a monitor, right? 
 We apprehended him last night. 
 I mean, this is unbelievable. 
 He cut it off. 
 Well, why even put it on? 
 I m... He killed somebody? 
 There was an assault. It wasn't a murder. 
 Oh, and that's good? You're proud of that? Huh? 
 I mean, are we safe? My whole family is up here right now. 
 He's in custody now. 
 You, your family... You should be fine. 
 The guy who killed my son is running around the city? 
 How the hell are we fine? 
 I mean, it's unbeliev... you... What are you all doing, huh? 
 What are you doing? 
 Alonzo : Just... just tell me what happened. 
 If you won't tell me,  mija... 
 All right, well, we'll just... 
 Just get in the car and let me take you to the doctor. 
 Why won't you talk to me? 
 Mija, are you afraid? Did Carlos do this? 
 Huh? That little punk? Did he? 
 Jenny. 
 Jenny, wait. 
 Jenny! Papi, just leave it. 
 Wait up! 
 What?! 
 Was it Carlos? 
 Stop it. 
 I just want to help. 
 You couldn't even handle your own business, but you're gonna help me? 
 We always talk. Always. 
 When I went to see you at juvie, your face was all messed up and you didn't say anything. 
 Huh? 
 And you're giving out our car to that banger, lie about it... 
 I didn't lie to you. 
 Now you want me to talk to you? 
 Stay here. Go to counseling with  papi. 
 Get yourself together. Leave me alone. 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 Hector : Crazy, man. It's straight crazy. 
 Dude gets loose. 
 All he's got to do is roll on out of here. 
 Can't even keep himself clean that long. 
 Brothers, man, they always bitch... 
 How a brother can't get a break. 
 They let his ass go, cuts a dude, O.D.s his girl. 
 I didn't do nothing, but I'm the one still stuck in here. 
 Prosecutors want to talk to you. 
 Hell, yeah, they want to talk to me. Now they do. 
 How bad, huh? 
 Very badly. 
 Real damn bad. 
 Delaying extradition's on the table. 
 Delaying? That was then. 
 Right now, that's just where things start. 
 If they want Carter, come at me correct. 
 Ain't nothing for free. 
 Do you have something to tell them? 
 Whatever you tell me is in confidence. 
 The county fights the feds on extradition... 
 That is a fight. 
 That's a fight for them, understand? 
 They stir up some bad blood, you need to have something to say. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Get them in here. 
 Sit their pale asses down, and let's get to crackin'. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Aubry moaning] 
 Quinn : You're back. 
 Told you you'd be back. 
 [Groans] 
 Losing a son like that must be difficult. 
 What made you want to come forward to talk about this? 
 My hope is that with more awareness, we can get justice for Matt. 
 He was a good son, a war veteran, a husband, a man taken from his family in a horrible, unnecessary way. 
 And for 24 hours, the man accused of killing your son, he escaped from police, he was on the run. 
 The system didn't work. It's that simple. 
 Some people have said race is playing a part in what's happening now. 
 Not from us. Not from my family. 
 I-I have always been... and I think I taught my children... to be open-minded, to respect everyone. 
 My younger son, Mark, he's marrying a girl in the military, and she happens to be an Asian. 
 Some people have alleged that your son may have been killed because he was involved in drugs. 
 What does that matter? 
 Even if it were true, that makes it okay to murder someone? 
 If he were on drugs, it's okay that my son was murdered? 
 You read all the time about a... black person who's actually a criminal. 
 They get shot by the police. People lose their minds. 
 A good white kid gets murdered in his home, well... 
 [Scoffs] 
 That's okay because maybe he smoked a joint on the weekends. 
 Hmm. 
 You were good. You were really strong. 
 You should see the comments on your website. 
 Oh. 
 The reaction... 
 You're tired. 
 You should relax for a minute. 
 Is there anybody you can go and have a glass of wine with? 
 Your son? 
 Mm. Would you want to? 
 I can't tonight. I have to go. 
 Oh, you told me. 
 You get these little rituals. 
 They help... some. 
 Get some rest. 
 Thank you. 
 And thank you. 
 Russ : How much would it have cost to have a cop sitting outside his door watching him? 
 Huh? You know, I always thought that if you cut one of those things off, there are alarms or something, somebody gets notified. 
 And it's frightening knowing that he was out there. 
 He... he could have done anything. 
 And I... [Sighs] 
 I hate to say it. Your mom was right. 
 She was... She was right about this. 
 Mark : And that bothers you? 
 Well, I'm just, uh, acknowledging she was right. 
 I got some locks from work. 
 Locks? 
 Yeah, you know, I'm just gonna maybe put a few extra of them up around the place. 
 This is a rental. 
 I don't think they'd appreciate you putting locks up. 
 Well, I get a discount from the store. 
 Russ, I don't need them. 
 I mean, your... your fiancée... 
 Your fiancée's coming up here, right? 
 I mean, you... you want things safe for her? 
 What would it hurt to just take a swing around the place and, you know, try to make things safe? 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm not doing this. 
 [Sighs] Doing what? 
 Pretending that everything is cool between us. 
 This is killing me, Russ. 
 Mark... 
 The only reason I am here, I'm doing clean-up for Matt, for what he did to Gwen. 
 He screwed that girl's life up. 
 Don't... don't blame it all on your brother. 
 Oh, I'm not. I'm not. It's not just him. 
 Hell, no. It's you. It's mom. 
 It's... It's the whole family. 
 I know. 
 Yeah, I was a bad father. I was. 
 And you have every right... 
 Oh, God. Come on. Stop. 
 You know, but I-I-I come here to help. You don't want it. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know, I admit I messed up, Mark, and you don't listen. 
 So... 
 Well, now it's too late. 
 No, not now. 
 I... I mean all those years. 
 I reached out. We talked all the time. 
 A phone call once a week. 
 I tried. I'm still trying. 
 By suing mom over Matt's body, by coming here and putting discount locks on my doors. 
 I mean, it's the same obsessive-compuls... 
 You gambling again, Russ? 
 No, I'm not gambling. 
 Well, you're sure as hell acting like you are. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you want me to do? 
 I want... [sighs] I want you to go. 
 After this, for you and me... 
 What do you want me to do... 
 I want you to live your life. 
 That's what I'm doing with mine. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Tommy : Hey. 
 How are you? 
 Nancy : Hmm? How am I? 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. [Chuckles] 
 [Scoffs] 
 But you look strong. 
 You look good. 
 You look well. 
 Hey, I've been following this case you're involved with. 
 Oh. What's on TV, that's just the half of it. 
 The prosecutors, the police, they are... 
 If I thought they were incompetent before... 
 They are putting this woman, her family through... 
 But what are you... what are you putting yourself through? 
 Oh, don't. Don't do it. 
 Don't do it. Not today. 
 You do this. You torture yourself. 
 Come on. You know you do. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. It's... Listen, I'm... 
 It's just... today of all days. 
 I mean, all days, you put yourself through this pain with strangers? 
 Um... [Sighs] 
 How I see it, if we're gonna talk about it, you walked away. 
 You walked away from what happened to us. 
 Do you remember that feeling when the police had no answers for us? 
 When the defense dragged us through the streets? 
 I know. I know. 
 I live with that every day. 
 It's still with me, the bang of the gavel when they gave that man 15 years for what they... 
 I know. 
 And I know you want to help other people. 
 I know. 
 But this lady says things in public that are just... 
 Can you blame her? 
 I sit with her and listen to the excuses and watch her melt. 
 A-a-and... And there's a difference between grieving and getting ugly. 
 What I saw her saying on television, I... 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't want you putting yourself in a place where you have to defend things... 
 I'm not putting myself through anything. 
 I choose to do this. 
 Defend things you don't believe in. 
 She's not you. 
 That's all I'm trying to say. 
 She's not you. 
 Hmm. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 I'll always love you. 
 Always love you. 
 Same time. 
 Next year. 
 Next year. 
 [Footsteps depart] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 What's going on? Where is he? 
 He's not scheduled for this judge. 
 You said he had an appearance. 
 Sometimes they shuffle cases. 
 Depends on the judges in session, the number of dockets. 
 After what they say he did, they're just going to shuffle his case? 
 Are they playing games? 
 I don't know. 
 Then find out. 
 Alonzo : It was tough, but I did my best. 
 I always did what I thought was best. 
 But, um, Roberta, she [Chuckles] she was better... 
 Rebecca : It's okay. 
 Um... 
 Anyway, after she passed, I-I would bring Tony to the shop with me. 
 It was hard sometimes to get a sitter. 
 And where would Jenny be? 
 At her uncle's. 
 I didn't think it was a good idea for a young girl to be around auto-shop guys. 
 Do you think that made her feel neglected? 
 No. No, I never neglected her. 
 But do you think... do you think it made her  feel  neglected? 
 I mean, she doesn't come here with you. 
 [Chuckles] She's a teenage girl. You know how that is. 
 What about Tony? What... what about raising Tony? 
 Oh, he was always by my side. 
 And, uh... later on, he started to pitch in, and then we thought it would be good to have something to do together, you know, so I-I got this old car, and we worked on it all the time. 
 It, uh... it was fun to be together. 
 When you hear your father speak about how much he misses doing things with you, how does that make you feel? 
 Good. 
 Well, do you think you might be able to find some time to spend with him, just the two of you, maybe this weekend? 
 Sure. 
 Is there something on your mind? 
 We've heard your father speak, but is there... is there anything you want to say? 
 Jenny doesn't come 'cause she hardly wants to be home anymore. 
 Antonio. 
 Ever since he got me arrested, things have been bad. 
 I did not get him arrested. 
 L-let him speak, please. 
 We got kicked out of church, and someone tagged on his garage. 
 And my sister's hurt or something. 
 He doesn't help her. He just yells at her. 
 Wait. Wait. You wait a minute! 
 Mr. gutlérrez, please. 
 Something's going on with my sister, and I want to know what's up with her. 
 And all he wants to do is talk about the stuff we used to do. 
 Mija, entiendo si no quieres hablar de lo que pasó,  pero acuérdate que somos su familia. 
 La familia ya tiene muchas problemas. La familia no tienen problemas,  mija. El cabrón que ti hizo eso, él sí tiene problemas. Montón de problemas. Por favor. podemos hablar de otras cosa? Si quieres. [Sighs]  me das una? Qué, qué? Una qué? una chela? Sí. No creo yo. Por qué no? Yo tomó cerveza. Pues entonces ya conoces  el sabor. No te tienes que echar una,  no? Ay, ay, ay. Eh... Don't lie to me. Do not sit there and lie to my face. Look, I am trying to help you, but you need to keep calm. I was at the downtown jail, and they said the same thing. He is most likely still in processing or just left processing. If he's not there and he's not here, then where is he? Chuck : No one is interrogating your daughter. So why does this have to happen now? Your daughter is the only eyewitness. If she can identify Carter, it guarantees us a conviction. You just arrested him for fleeing. He just ran off! Those charges can only be added if he's convicted of the original crime. I don't understand any of this. Can you please explain what's going on? Look, we are trying to get a conviction. And the best way for us to do that is with a statement from Gwen. You have not told us the truth once. Not once. And the only reason you're here is because you've all made a joke of this case, and now Gwen's the only one who can fix it. That's the truth, isn't it? I think it would help her to know that the man who hurt her is in jail doing life or facing execution. [Sighs] Gwen, could you please state your full legal name for me? [Beep] Skokie. Um... Gwendolyn Elizabeth Skokie. Okay. I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Is that all right? Yes. All right. Do you know where you are right now? With nurses. Uh, in... in the hospital. Do you know why you're here? What happened to you? I got hurt. And your husband was killed. Yes. Okay, I want to ask you about how you got hurt. Now, I have six photos here. You tell me if you recognize any of the men in these pictures. [Clears throat] No. You don't recognize any of them? No. Do you know a man named Carter Nix? Uh... I-I don't know people named Carter. Did your husband have any previous contact with him? I'm not sure. Maybe. [Sighs] Could you try to think back to the morning of the attack? Um... What was the last thing you remember about that Sunday? Sunday... Um... We took a trip... Goleta. We wanted to see the butterf-flies. That... that was a different Sunday. That was three weeks before the... We... we all took that trip together, remember? I was driving. And Matt was... Sick. [Chuckles] Matt was sick. I was watching you drive us home. It was like I wanted to be a kid again, sitting in the backseat. And then... Chuck : After that? I don't remember after that. After going to see the butterflies? Three weeks after that? No. [Voice breaking] I'm in the backseat. [Sniffles] I'm in the car. That's... that's all. What... What am I to remember? Who is Carter Nix? I don't know. I don't know him! He was in your house. What happened that night? [Sobs] I-I don't know. Stop! That's enough. Stop. It's okay. It's enough. Don't talk. It's over. It's over. [Sniffles] It's okay. You don't need to talk. No more talking. No more talking. [Door closes] 
 
 [Thud] [Sighs] Everything okay? Oh. Sorry. Uh... I didn't, um... I'm invisible. I got that quality. You still up for swapping drama, mine's really good at the moment. [Chuckles] Yeah? What's the latest? I'm pretty sure my son hates me. Hmm. You know, that's what sons do. They hate their dads. It's a complex. They call it something. They... they call it a something complex? [Chuckles] No. It's, uh, Oedipus Complex. I think that's it. How about you? Kids? No. I was married once. What happened with yours? Just broke. You know, it was working, working, working. And then one day, it just, uh... It quit working. Like a TV. Like a man. Honestly, I'm not trying to sound bitter. He just, uh... you know, he did his guy thing and took off. Hmm. Men do that. Yeah. Why? Hmm. I mean, where do they all run to? It's not like they ever end up anyplace better. It's usually someplace like... Arizona. No, it's worse than that. Usually it's someplace like... That's where I ended up. Arizona. You split on your wife? Split, got kicked out. So, uh, what other drama do you have? You ready? Sure. My, uh, son... My... my other son lived here in Modesto. Uh, he was murdered. H...His... his wife was shot in their own house. Oh, God. Those two? They were your family? I came here to bury one son, I find out the other one doesn't want me around. That's what messed me up. Not that he thinks I'm a lousy dad. Um... That he thinks I'd give up on him. Ran once. Not running again. I-I got to, uh... I got to get back on the floor. [Monitor beeping] Aubry : Oh. [Groaning] I-I need a hit, please. The rental car. Was that all you wanted it for? To get away? Daddy. Help me. Your N.A. meetings. I am dying. Was that all crap, too? Help me. The police want to talk to you. You have to make a deal. They'll reduce the charges if you turn on that man. This is real. You get it? You cut that man loose. Stop it. You helped him escape. S-stop. They'll send you to prison if you don't help yourself. Oh, stop. I'm sick. You have to turn him in. I'm so... Aubry, listen to me. Oh. I'm so sick. Let me help you. Look at what this man's done to you. Look at yourself. You've got to turn him in. Listen to me. Let me help you. Please, Aubry! Go away. Go. Aubry, let me help you. Get out! Aubry, please... Aubry... Get! Get out! Get out! [Grunts] [Monitor beeping rapidly] I found a judge to meet with. I'm filing a writ. I'm filing a writ. They have to produce the body. That's just terminology. I know they're trying to force a confession out of him. But if they hurt Carter now, that would be stupid. If they hurt him now, then it all goes away. Their lies, their mistakes. He wanted a plate of ribs. If I'd gotten him a plate, sat with him... All he wanted... The devil's hand is in this, Aliyah. He wanted to talk to me as his sister. All I had to do was be family for him, and I couldn't even acknowledge that. So is that the devil or is that me? All he had to do was not run away. I expect him to take responsibility. So I need to take mine. Brian : Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you. You better? Dad said you had it pretty bad. Here. Let me help. [Exhales sharply] Here. Look, I know that this might suck to hear. But I really think that you should listen to dad, talk to the police. If you help them, if you come clean, they'll work something out for you. Come clean. Get out of here. Come back home. That what you want? Do you really think confessing will make things better? [Sighs] You're okay, though? Well... Everybody's okay? I don't even know what okay is anymore. They look you in the face, they tell you they're handling everything. It's like you said on TV. You saw it? I-I saw it online. But you're right. The system doesn't help people like us. It's ridiculous. [Chuckles] What? My son's fiancée is coming to Modesto, so that should be interesting. Mark said he wasn't even sure he wanted me to meet her. He didn't know how I would handle it. Why would he say that? Well, because he said she is a woman of color. What? Yes. What does that even mean? I thought saying "colored people" was supposed to be offensive. So she's a black girl? Asian. Well, could be worse. One more person I have to justify myself to. You don't have to justify anything. I used to see... grieving mothers on TV going after whoever they thought was responsible. I would think, "I get it. You're upset, but don't be crazy. Don't act crazy." There's nothing crazy about believing no one cares as much about my son and what happened to him as I do. The police don't. The lawyers don't. Not even the rest of my family. So I can just imagine what people are thinking when they see me. So what do you think? Maybe the chicken sonoma egg scramble? I... don't know. Could be fun. [Chuckles] If you agree to plea to the charge of receiving stolen property... After the court hears your testimony, you will be released with time served. Released? Or sent back to Mexico? You'll avoid deportation as long as possible. [Scoffs] It's a good deal, Hector. You need to think about your future. You shot me. You stuck me in here, and I got my face slashed. But now all of a sudden, you're worried about my future? You put out some deal, and me and my man are just supposed to take it? You know, I've got nothing but time up in here. Almost three months getting my leg fixed, getting my face fixed. I started reading this law book, but didn't make no sense to me. So I got to talking to some three-strikers. Them three-strikers, they know the law. Hector, it's a good deal. I want immunity. I don't want any of this to come back on me after. Then I get put in Witness Protection. I want a clean record. I want a clean start. [Scoffs] Man. If you had any kind of something, you wouldn't be sitting there. All that nonsense Carter pulled on you. You all look like bitches. [Chuckling] Straight stupid bitches. You want me to talk on Carter? I get immunity, Witness Protection, and drop all that extradition crap, and you got to show me some love. I'm not saying nothing until I know you're for real. What kind of gesture? [Scoffs] I hate this hellhole. Get me out and get me someplace I'm protected. What's up with Jenny? She told me to squash it. I'm not gonna snitch. This ain't snitching. It's my sister. Who jumped her? Was some kid named Joaquin Montoya. I kind of know him from around school. He was crushing on your sister some, and I don't know why, but he smacked her. [Siren wails in distance] Jenny's your girl? I like her. A guy beats on her, and you don't do nothing. You know who he is. Stay away from her. [Train whistle blowing] Luis : Should never put your hand on bitches. I don't care what kind of drama they got. They all got to be treated like people. You know what I'm saying? Adrian : Who's this Joaquin bitch? I don't know. Hey, you need to chill out, man. Drink up. ♪  Yes, indeedy  ♪ Yeah, chill, son. We're all friends here. Yeah.

Rick : Evidence has now surfaced that shows, on multiple occasions, the accused has committed assaults with the specific purpose of intimidating and terrorizing his victims based on their membership to an ethnic group. We now believe, without question, Carter Nix targeted Matt and Gwen Skokie and entered their home with the intent to cause bodily harm because of their race. For this reason, the District Attorney's office has decided it will vigorously pursue additional special-circumstances charges against Carter Nix. As of today, this case is officially being categorized as a hate crime. We are continuing to investigate all aspects of the case and believe we can win a conviction on all the charges Carter Nix is facing. A press release will be made available through the D.A.'s office. Thank you for attending. They should have made a deal with me from the jump. Could have avoided all this nonsense.
