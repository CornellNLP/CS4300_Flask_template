 You lied, Russ. You're a felon. 
 We have to let you go. 
 He said he'd been "made aware" of my problem. 
 That you were a convict. 
 Somebody leaked information about me. 
 Barb's out there on TV saying the things she says. 
 She's attracting the wrong kind of attention. 
 Why are you hounding my son, huh? 
 We're not targeting Tony. 
 You yank my boy off the street again, and that's not "targeting"? 
 We have a recording of Tony assaulting another young man with a pipe. 
 They're letting me go home? 
 After you give the testimony in court... that's the deal. 
 So, what's the situation down in Sinaloa? 
 Man : Hello? 
 Sibila es allí? 
 Hector? 
 He'd get me wasted, and I would get passed around. 
 Man : He and his friends sexually abused you? 
 That's how it happened, right, Brian? 
 You know she's lying. She's a drug addict! 
 A good white kid gets murdered in his home, well... 
 That's okay because maybe he smoked a joint on the weekends. 
 The victim... people are calling him a 9/11 hero, not the anti-government drug dealer he was. 
 All I'm asking is to open an investigation into how this entire case has been handled. 
 Please help me. I need you. 
 For my brother, I ask for people to honor our right to assemble and call attention to his situation. 
 If they let us do that peacefully, then it's all good. 
 If we're greeted any other way... 
 Then what happens isn't on us. 
 It's on them. 
 Narasaki : Test, test, test. 
 We rolling? 
 [Beep] 
 It's been 3 1/2 months since you were first arrested. 
 Why are so many people suddenly taking an interest in your case? 
 Why now? 
 My sister. 
 Without her, I'd be just another black man thrown in prison and forgotten. 
 She got  you to come here, right? 
 Kind of blows my mind what she and the people she's working with are doing for me. 
 Your sister plans to hold a march in downtown Modesto tomorrow, just ahead of your preliminary examination, which will determine whether or not your case goes to trial. 
 Is your sister trying to sway opinion? 
 She's just showing support. 
 She claims city leaders are conspiring to prevent the rally. 
 Why would they do that? 
 I don't know. 
 If hundreds of African-American protestors get arrested, it's news, and that's good for you. 
 How is that good? 
 Doesn't that take attention away from your crime? 
 We've seen this in other situations recently... 
 Outside agitators being brought in to start violence. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know... 
 This isn't working for me. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Is this what we can expect tomorrow? 
 Is your sister agitating for violence? 
 Is that what she wants? 
 Malik : Yes! 
 The social-media response has been more than we could've hoped for. 
 Two buses from stockton, another group coming from Oakland. 
 Where do you expect to park these buses? 
 Aliyah : We'll find a lot. 
 And we need facilities for these folks... 
 Someplace for them to use the bathroom. 
 Portable toilets. 
 They're not free. 
 We'll do some fundraising. 
 In the next 24 hours? 
 That's how much time we have. 
 We have to talk about food. 
 How are we gonna feed all these people? 
 They're soldiers. They can handle it. 
 They're not soldiers. They're supporters. 
 What are the numbers? 
 We're near 200 marchers. 
 Look... I know you want to make a statement, but I think we may be getting too big. 
 Luis :  Handle this fool. Come on! 
 Go! Go! Hayes : It's not good news. The D.A.'s planning on charging your son as an adult. What are you gonna do to stop him? I really don't know what I can tell you. You can tell me how you're gonna help my son. You seen the video? It's self-incriminating. It makes things difficult. And it makes it very difficult that it's playing everywhere. Well, Tony was defending himself. The other kid's bigger than Tony. H-he's a thug. He was being held by one of Tony's accomplices while Tony beat him with a pipe. The best way I can help your son is if you can help  me. He needs to take a plea deal. No. He beat this young man for a reason. No plea deal! He beat this young man for a reason. You know what? Give me some kind of defense. Give me something I can take to the prosecutors. [Indistinct talking] Man : Shoot it! Aw, that's a foul, man! That's a foul! Edgar : Tony, Tony, Tony. Ah, what's up, son? What's up, boy? Trying to charge me as an adult. I can't go to prison. They give you maybe three years. You do half of that. Hey. You did right by your sister. You think anyone's gonna mess with her again? And you kept your mouth shut about my cuz. Yeah. You go in, you do some time, for real, you come out, you gonna be ferocious. Like I told you the first time, you ain't a bitch no more. I'm not a bitch. Hell no, you ain't. I seen that video. Man, you laid that boy out. How'd that feel? Yeah, man, that feel good, yo. Hey, don't sweat it. A year inside, all that's gonna do is grow you up some more. Come on. Come on. [Engine turns over, tone ringing] [Gearshift clicks] Aah! [Breathing shakily] [Crying] [Slow-tempo music playing] Any idea when I could expect to hear from someone? Doris : Um, we'll call if we have anything. [Sighs] Jackson : Sibila Nuñez. What a... What about her, man? She wants to visit you. S-she wants to come up from Mexico? No. She's here. She's in Modesto. She wants to see you as soon as possible. She... she wants... she wants to see me why? I don't even know who she is. [Sighs] She's my girlfriend. She said you called her. No, no, no. See, I called her father. Well, she's come a long way to see you. That means something. Hector? Yeah. Well, yeah. O-okay. "Okay," you want to see her? I'll... I'll see her, yeah. I-I want to see her. All right. I'll get her on the list. [Door buzzes, opens] Officer Rodriguez : Can you identify the person who threw the projectile? Barb : You think I waited around to see if anyone else wanted to attack me? Were there any witnesses? There was a parking lot full of people. Anyone we can contact? I... I don't know. No. Well, most likely, it was just some rowdy kids. It was not kids. The problem is bigger than that. They want to hurt me. Who's "they"? You should see the things. That's the thing, ma'am. That they're writing about me online. I see how upset you are. But I got to tell you, without an I.D., there's not a lot we can do here. [Cellphone rings] Are you gonna be this casual when you're writing about how I was killed? [Cellphone beeps] Yes? Ms. Hanlon, this is Al Sanchez in the district attorney's office. This is a courtesy call to inform the families that the office will be offering a plea deal to Carter Nix as a resolution to your son's case. What... are you saying? Plea deal? This is a courtesy call to inform the families. But what deal? I'm not signing off on any deal. That's all the information I have. As I mentioned, this is just a courtesy call. Thank you. But I... [click] Uh... Barb : What is this about a plea deal? Rick : We're not offering him forgiveness. The plea agreement we're putting in front of Carter Nix is 25 years to life. It's a serious sentence. He'll be eligible for parole in half that time. My son was 32. He took away 40 years of his life, 50 years? That... that man who killed him deserves to die. I understand your feelings, Ms. Hanlon. You offer up this... deal, and you understand how I feel? In the time since your son was killed, we've had eight more murders in the county. Are you too busy to prosecute the case? We prosecute cases we can win. What we have against Nix is circumstantial. No! No, it's not. If we can get a deal instead of a jury trial, It's the same case you've always had. Always. We'll all be better for it. You have the gun now. What we have is one witness you didn't have the gun before. That can tie the gun to Carter Nix. Having the gun gives us leverage in reaching an agreement. It doesn't guarantee anything. I would think it puts you in the position of being able to take the case to trial. Could you explain to Ms. Hanlon that the majority of cases, no matter how severe, never get to trial? Never. If we go to the preliminary examination and the judge tosses this case, if you think 25 years to life is nothing, how are you going to feel if the case is dismissed? You're caving. This march, all these people coming to Modesto... You're afraid of them. I'm not. I'm not agreeing to any plea offer. We don't need your permission. To be frank, the coverage of your family's less-than-ideal behavior has put added pressure on my office to make this deal. Damn you. Seriously... damn you. [Door opens] He's gutless. I've known it from the beginning. He's right. Most cases don't make it to trial. He's afraid of that march. He needs to be afraid of  us. Not afraid. He needs to support us. He wouldn't have called this a hate crime if we hadn't gone public, so we have to... We have to organize like they are. We should... Organize how? We should have our own demonstration... Same place at the same time. No, they have had weeks to get ready. To do what? To bus in a lot of people? To wear head scarves and act scary? We're in the right. I'm not gonna let people forget that. Little : 25 to life with the possibility of parole if you plead guilty to second-degree murder/manslaughter. Parole after how many years? Maybe 15. If convicted, you face the death penalty. They have a witness testimony. They have the gun. You think I should take it? I'm telling you what you're looking at. This is the best deal you're gonna get... Safer than the jury. I'm tired. I just want it to be over. Y-y-you've done everything that you could. But you show up with your people, it's gonna be bad out there. They're gonna put everything I deserve on  you. 15 years? I can handle that. No. Just end it. No! [Sighs] Look, you're my lawyer. Take the deal. Carter, you've already tried to kill yourself once. What... two years, five years in prison before you try to do it again? You're not well. You don't understand, okay? You either walk out of here free or you're dead. Because if you're convicted, that victim's mother, she's gonna do whatever she can to make sure you're executed. Aliyah, I can't take it anymore. No, no, no. Don't give up. Don't give up. I can't take it. Don't take the plea deal. Okay. Al hum du illah. [Sighs] [Breathes shakily] Lisa! Hey! Hi. [Chuckling] Hi. [Car alarm chirps] So, um, sorry to hear about you losing your job. Misunderstanding. Nobody's fault. You look good. Oh. That color... that color looks pretty on you. Thanks. Yeah. I... I was wondering if, after work, maybe we could get... No. You know, I just wanted to talk, you know, like we did before... Swap drama. I got some pretty good drama I need... No. It's not true... That garbage they're saying about my family, uh, in the news. It's... Okay. Hey. I just want to talk. You ran out on your family, and you lied about being in jail. Let's just... let's just leave it at that, okay? Therapist : Get that right foot. There we go. Now, s... Pushing through it. You're doing good. You're strong. There we go. [Gwen grunts] Don't let this hold you back. Keep going. Right foot. Right. There we go. Make it solid. Now get that left foot up. There we go. Good. Good. Take a deep breath. [Breathes deeply] All right, there we go. Let's keep going. Walker. Now the left. Oh! You got it. You got it. Barb : It's about Gwen. I want this to be about Gwen. People have written about her. They've talked about her every possible way. Yes. But since this has happened, she hasn't had a chance to speak for herself. She can't really speak for herself. She has aphasia. Then for someone to speak for her properly. This is your chance to have a march in Gwen's name. She can't walk. To have an  event  for her. I don't... Please don't be literal. We're doing everything we can to keep Gwen from knowing what's being said about her. We're not letting our daughter get dragged around in public. We're not gonna make some kind of exhibition out of her. If you don't, the man who killed my son is gonna walk out of jail. Or they'll give him a deal. Tom and I, we have prayed on this. Or they're going to... to let him off. God! Why is it so wrong to ask for guidance? You want us to put our daughter on display just to fix what you've wrecked? You have your daughter. My son is dead. We're not letting Gwen get dragged out like some sad, pathetic victim. If people could see Gwen, they'll see the truth. She's Miss Modesto, for God's sake. If Matt had lived and Gwen had died, would you do this to him? I made a bad mistake with Gwen before. I'm not gonna make another one. Can... Can we talk to Tom about this? I said no, and that's how it's going to be. Richelle : Have you been avoiding me? Russ : Uh, Mark made it pretty clear he didn't want me around right now. I left you messages. I invited you out to lunch. Congratulations, though. Mark's... I'm sure you're gonna do real well together. I think so. I hope so. He's a good kid. You're not answering my question. Have you been avoiding me? Hm. When Mark's brother got married, he... he went through the trouble of inviting me. And that's how it was, too... trouble. Barb didn't want me around. Gwen's parents tolerated me. Not a lot more important than seeing your own boy give his vows. I really wanted to be there. But I knew better. It's the same way now. I mean, I... I know better than to come around. Yeah, but you did get invited. You could've gone. Let me ask you something. When you skipped the wedding, you think you were trying to make more of a statement by  not  being there than by showing up? I, uh... [Lock beeps, clicks] [Clears throat] Hey. Russ came to see you. You guys want to talk alone? No. You're fine. Um, we don't need to talk. Russ, would you like a minute with your son? Thank you. Okay. [Smooches] What do you need? Okay, well, um... I've come to ask a favor. I lost my job. You know, there's a smear campaign against all of us... Mainly against Matt and Gwen, but... Yeah, you can't stay here. No, no, no. I-I wouldn't ask that. I-I'm not... That's not what I'm asking. I don't want to intrude. I was hoping that... I was thinking that, you know, maybe I, you know, could help fix up Matt and Gwen's place in exchange for staying there. You want to sleep in the house where Matt was killed? You know, i-it's funny. I was just... I was thinking that, you know, maybe it would... It would make me... Help me feel, you know, closer to him. I don't know. Is that weird? I don't know. I... You know, maybe this is a way I can help. Well, it's not up to me. You're gonna have to ask Tom and Eve. Yeah, we're not on real good terms. I was... I was hoping you could ask  for  me. [Sighs] [Chuckles] You know what? [Sighs] Just let it go. Okay? It's over for you here. I'm not leaving again. You don't know. [Sighs] You don't. When you're a father, you're a father the rest of your life. All right? And if you're gonna start a family, that's something... Hey, don't talk to me about family. That's something that you need to learn. You have no idea what family means. It doesn't go away, all right? You don't even... And... and... and... And making that house nice for Gwen is something. Yes, staying there for free. It's something. And right now, where I am... I need something. If you can find more people to make more posters. Thank you. [Siren wailing] Little : They don't get in without a warrant. They don't get  in. We have to go. Go where? Everybody needs to leave the building right now. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Aliyah. What's going on? [Siren wailing in distance] There's no bomb. There's no bomb in there. Somebody just wants to scare us. Or disrupt us. Barb : If you know people... if... If there are people you could reach out to... It's for tomorrow? Yes. That's really fast. There's going to be reporters. I can't let those people be the only ones on the news. Anyone... Anyone who can come out... My husband and I are members of a group. Okay. I'm pretty sure we can get people to come out. That's great. The Central Valley Rainbow Works. This is wonderful. Thank you. We're not that big, but we do have association with a lot of other like-minded organizations. "Rainbow Works." God keeps all the colors of the rainbow separate, just like we need to keep our races separate. W-what do you mean separate? They have their areas, and we have ours. Segregation? Separation. [Sighing] I don't believe in that. Of all the times we've spent and the way you've talked, I-I thought you had the right idea about how... What right idea? That man killed my son. He should die. That's not racist. With separation, that wouldn't be a problem. Do you want our help or not? Alonzo : They're desperate right now. We have to use that. Tony : "Use that" how? They want to convict the black guy, Nix. They want him badly. But, oh, the other guy, the illegal you gave our car to, they let him off. Now, they would do the same for  you,  but you have to give them something they can use. I don't know anything. You have to know something,  mijo.  You... I didn't do anything. I know. I know you didn't do anything. But you were hanging around the illegal. Maybe he said something. No. Something about Nix, a-about killing the veteran and the wife. He didn't say anything. He didn't say anything about it. But... There has to be something that you can tell them. Just... Tell them that you know the black guy killed the war vet. How would I know that? From the guy you gave our car to. You want me to lie? They've  all  lied. All of them have lied. You told me to tell the truth. The police have lied. You told me... The other families have lied. Now I'm telling you  this. We have to do this now... Today. They're scared right now because of the protest march. Okay? And they're ready to settle. If they do that, we lose our chance. We only have one chance, mijo. Tony. So we have to come up with a plan... our story. Okay? So, he comes back to the shop... If the police need somebody to lie so bad, maybe the guy didn't do anything... like me. Have you thought about that? You can't help me. I got to take care of  myself. 
 
 [Door buzzes] Hector... mentiroso. Te... otra vez. ÿVienes todo este camino para...? Otra vez. Sí. No tengo que hablar contigo. Me puedo ir a mi quarto. Mmhmm. Esta tranquilo ahi,  no hay mujeres... Mm-hmm. Why you even come? It's the only way I can lay eyes on you... When you're locked down in jail. What the... is wrong with you, Hector? You lie and lie. Cincos años and nothing from you. Well, I don't... I don't have no money. No quiero dinero. Look, I tried. You know, I try over and over. I don't want money. I couldn't give you anything else. I couldn't try. You got a picture of her? Say her name. [Chuckles softly] Adela. They wouldn't let me bring in my phone. That's who you ran from. I-I-I didn't run. They were gonna put a murder on me. You said you'd send for us. I would've. I come up here, my English isn't good, I got these tats. People see me how they see me, and that's all they see. I can't get a job. So you start thieving? I can't get a... I can't even get a chance. You start thieving? You start hustling? Hmm? You're too busy banging to be there for me, for your own daughter? [Voice breaking] You hurt me, Hector. [Sniffles] I believed you. ÿPor qué me mentiste? Respect me. I was... Be a man. I was ashamed. I tried to do right in méjico, I tried to do right over here, but every time I try to do right, it goes bad. You want to be ashamed of something? Be ashamed you left your little girl. When... When all this is over, they're gonna put me in Witness Protection. Here? In America? Yeah. You... You can come with me. And... and... and... and Adela. They won't let me in. They  would. They would if we're married. [Door buzzes, opens] [Door closes] [Door slams, locks] Nancy : I'm - I'm not having much luck. A dozen people have responded... A-a couple of groups that I don't want to have anything to do with. They flooded my e-mail with... the most horrible things. Let me see. God. We'll either look ridiculously weak or be overrun by thugs. Neither of those help your cause. I can't even get 100 decent people to support my son. I'm not giving up. You want to be around those people? Everybody else can cave in. It's... It's getting ugly. It can't keep going the way things are going. You out there alone means more than you standing with 100 bigots. I'll stay. I'll support... Even if we're the only ones. But I'm not gonna do it if you're inviting those other people in. Am I a racist? Oh, my God. Geez. [Train horn blowing] [Bell clanging] [Train horn blowing in distance] Must be pretty hard up if he wants to stay in that place. He's  always  hard up. But at least he's not asking for money or to stay with any of us. He  is  kind of a sad sack, your dad. Let's just call him Russ, okay? [Inhales deeply] Still, he  is  good with his hands. Russ works at a garden store. Worked at a garden store. Yeah. I'm just passing on the message. However you want to handle it... I got no issues. If he wants to fix that place up, he's doing us all a favor. Sooner we sell that graveyard, the better. [Door closes] Hello, mom. "Mom." It's "mom" now, hmm? One of my therapy classes is all about forgiveness. It's not really your fault you let Brian do that to me. [Scoffs] I can understand why you hate  me. Your father... God bless him... is an enabler, and I'm not. I never tolerated the things that you did. But why Brian? Brian's an idiot. He wasn't passing you off to his friends or using you as a s*x object. You don't know that. You don't care. [Sighs] What's going to happen to him? Oh, it's still happening. The police are going through his whole life... Cellphones, e-mails... He's being violated, you mean. He's humiliated. You've  done that to him. Why? Can you just tell me... Are you recording this? Oh, God. For real. [Scoffs] I've got nothing against any of you all. But you wanted me to flip on Carter, and I will sell  you  all down the river before that happens. Why that man? Why are you so beholden to someone who's going to get you killed? No, we have saved each other more times than I can count, and even if... even if it's as bad as you think, I... He's violent! You think that... that this is... is some kind of a joke. Or it's fun or it's cool. Just for one time in your life, couldn't you see yourself so in love with somebody... Aubry! Aubry, listen to me! It's not real! So tied to them, He's a criminal... That if you couldn't live with them, and you're an addict! You couldn't live at all? [Sighs] I love how that feels. There's just us or there's absolutely nothing. And the only time I feel that way is when I'm with  him. [Smacks lips, sighs] You can't save him anymore. They have the gun. They can't prove Carter ever touched that gun. 'Cause he didn't. They're going to convict him. Mnh-mnh. His sister's gonna flood this town with people. They aren't gonna kill Carter. They can't kill him. Sherrod : The city is willing to allow for a legally permitted free-speech rally in Gallo Park for up to 150 people. Gallo Park? That's  outside  the city. It's a well-known area, easily accessible, lots of parking for the press and for participants. You would have full use of city and county facilities. Less work for you, lower cost, safer, and you could avoid arrests. From the beginning, we've asked for the same thing... A review of how the case against my brother has been handled. The prosecutor making this a hate crime was punitive, not real. My brother doesn't hate whites. He has a Caucasian girlfriend. What does that mean? "Some of his best friends..." The D.A. has overreached. We want a fair examination. You want confrontation. I want what's right for my brother. The only reason you invited me here is because you're  afraid of confrontation. Do you... expect more than 150 people? I'm sure I can up it to 200. Look, we're just trying to avoid things getting out of hand. We've had bomb threats directed at us, death threats, and you're concerned about  us  getting out of hand? My concern is for how these things always end. With violence. These "things" always  begin with violence... Violence against innocent black men. That does not include your brother. Then review the case and prove it. Darrel : Should be ready in a couple hours. Barb : Is there a coffee shop or something around here I could walk to? Not really. [Blues music plays] Hi. Come on in. Hello. Can I help you? Oh, no. You want to look around? Uh, wouldn't even know what I'm looking at. Just looking for a spot to rest while your car's getting fixed? We don't get a lot of foot traffic in here. People come in, either know what they want or waiting on car repair. I think I want a gun. You think? I think I  need  one. For what purpose? [Sighs] Self-protection. There are people who would like to kill me, and the police don't seem interested in stopping it. Are you that woman whose son was murdered? You know what? I'm gonna go wait for my car... I'm so sorry for what happened to you. I can't even imagine. N-not a lot of people have said that to me. Thank you. Somehow, me and my family have been turned into the bad guys. I've noticed that on the news. All right. You do have options. [Shelf slides] A lot of women like the derringer types because they're small. This is a .38 revolver. [Gun clicking] Has a rounded hammer. Won't catch on things in your purse if you choose to carry it there. Packs a little more punch. Then, there are the semiautomatics... [Gun cocks] Like this .45 caliber. Can I... see what it feels like to pull the trigger? Of course. [Trigger clicks] Once the safety is released, the weapon is ready for firing. There is no magazine in it, so it's safe. But it's a good idea to keep it pointed away from people. That's just a good habit to develop. [Trigger clicks] Wow. That's really easy.  Too  easy, maybe. I don't want to shoot by accident. That's why you need the safety. Try this one. [Gun clicks] It's a revolver. [Trigger clicks] That's better. That's nice. I can carry this in my purse? Law says you have to have a concealed carry permit. Otherwise, you have to keep it unloaded in a lockbox in your trunk or in the home. What good will that do if some maniac's coming after me? That's right. And if you're in danger, the time it would take to locate and load could make the difference between life and death. I don't get it. What am I supposed to do? Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6. I'll take it. In the name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful... Malik : Everyone needs to fill out a form. We need your full name and an emergency contact. Praise be to the lord of the universe who created us... Rally marshals are wearing red armbands. If you have any questions, ask  them. Listen to their instructions. And made us into tribes and nations... [Train horn blows] Lieutenant Wilson, Modesto S.W.A.T. What do we got? We've got an un-permitted assembly. Yousef : That we may know each other... We've got marked units out here. We've got our mounted patrol. Not despise each other. Separation is equal! Separation is beautiful! We want what  you  want... To live our lives. If the enemy inclines toward peace, do thou also incline towards peace... Officer : Remember, lowest force possible today. We don't want any mess. We want to go home. And trust in God, for the Lord is one who hears and knows all things. Malik : Troublemaking and property damage will not be tolerated. And the servants of God most gracious are those who walk the earth in humility. Not to calm down! [Speaking indistinctly] Let's go. Get him out of here! And when we address them...
