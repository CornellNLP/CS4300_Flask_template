 [Breathing deeply] 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 [Groans] 
 [Grunts] 
 Russ :  This is Russ. You caught me away from the phone. 
 Please leave a message. [ Beep ] Chuck :  Mr. Skokie, this is Chuck Palmer with the City of Modesto robbery/homicide division. I'm going to leave you a number, and if you could please give me a call back as soon as you can. [Grunts]  It's very important that I speak with you. [Sighs] Yes, this is Russ. Yes. W-wait. What does that... What does that... mean? Y-you... you... you think he's been... I-I'm s... w... Yeah, uh, I-I would have to fly. I don't know how soon I-I... Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, I'll let you know. [Beep] Stu :  Good morning. I'm meteorologist Stu Haines in the Kyww Weather Center. Our five-day forecast... Woman :  People filled the Modesto city council meeting, many carrying signs... [Radio chatter] Man :  You can feel the excitement all over the city... [Airplane engines roar] Woman over P.A. :  Welcome to Modesto Airport. Please do not leave baggage unattended for the safety of yourself and all airport passengers. Mr. Skokie. Chuck Palmer, Modesto P.D. It's the last room over here. Mr. Skokie, someone inside the room is going to pull the blind back. You're going to see a table with a body on it. I need you to tell me if the body you see is your son. Let me know when you're ready. Mr. Skokie. Mm. Go ahead. [Gulps] That's Matt. That's him. Why don't we, uh, go sit down somewhere... Can I, um... [Voice breaking] Is there a bathroom I could use? [Sobbing] [Coughs] [Groans] [Inhales deeply, continues sobbing] We took a call from one of your son's neighbors. Officers responded to your son's home, where they found two victims. Gwen? Is Gwen dead? Gwen's at the hospital. She's in critical condition. I have to be honest, Mr. Skokie. It doesn't look very hopeful. We're still investigating what happened, but we haven't been able to locate a wallet, credit cards, I.D. for your son at the scene. It's possible the motivation was robbery, but we're not ruling anything out. Mr. Skokie, I can't go into specifics, but your son's wife... There are indications she was sexually assaulted. [Laughter] Oh, God. [Indistinct conversations] Now, we have a few leads that we're following. Oh, God. We have a very strong description of a vehicle of interest that was in the vicinity during the shooting. The driver we're looking for is a young hispanic male. Is Gwen all right? Is she gonna... Is she gonna be all right? She's in critical condition, Mr. Skokie. I'd like to... I think I would like to see her... I honestly don't know right now. And go where she is. We want to catch the person who did this, and if there's anything you can do to help us... Did your son ever mention anyone that he had any problems with, anyone who might... No. Matt, he... I-I don't... h-he's not... When was the last time that you talked to him, Mr. Skokie? Sunday. W-we talked every... That's when it happened, isn't it? Have you called his mother yet? No, sir. We had your number. We contacted you for a positive I.D. Would you like to call his mother? Would you like to call her, Mr. Skokie? [Rock music plays] Derrick : This it for you? Hector : That's it. [Cash register beeping] Yeah, these are sick, man. Trying to get me a pair. Yeah. [Sighs] It's gonna be $235.35. [Beeping] [Printer whirs] All right, Mr. Skokie. You enjoy those. All right.

'Cause if you're done, he can go. Carlos : Hey, um, see you at school, all right? [Sighs] Why do you have to be so rude? [Door closes] Jenny, you know you're not supposed to have anyone over during the week. We were doing homework. Homework? Yes. Really? No books? We finished. Oh, you finished. No, you didn't finish,  mija,  so don't tell me that. All right. Now everything's a mess. You got boys coming over. It's not a mess! I was doing my nails! Jenny, if you can't follow the rules, then I guess you don't get to go to your little party over the weekend or anything else you had planned. Jenny. Jenny. [Sighs] Papi. Mijo. How was your day? Good. So, the, uh... the starter came in. Come by the garage tomorrow. We'll put it in. Okay. So, you know this boy from school? Mm, not really. Well, does he get in trouble a lot? I don't know him. What were they doing? Homework. And then you came in. That's it. I'm gonna watch TV. [Brakes squeak] [Indistinct conversations] I couldn't hardly recognize him. The detective said that the... t-the gun must have been right in the front of his face. Well, what are the police doing? Well, they... they... they have a description of a car. A... when was Matt killed, Sunday? It's Tuesday. All they have is a description of a car? And, uh, they said that, uh, they think it might be an hispanic kid. Some illegal? I... just "hispanic." Why did they call you? And, uh... and they said that they... They think that maybe G-Gwen was raped. I don't understand why they called you. I'm his father. [Sighs] No, I-I don't understand why they called you  first. You know, they just, uh... T-they found my number, and they called me. What about Mark? Yeah, I wanted to, uh, you know, talk to you first. Oh. You haven't called Mark yet? Oh, my God, Russ. No, no, I thought we should call him together. I'll call him. Well, he's my son, too. I'll call him. We need to be a family now. For both our boys right now, we need to be a family. [Taps table] I need to talk to the police. I need to find out why they're not doing anything.

I know that there's a hit in my bag. [Groans] Okay. Did you smoke it?! Why would you say something like that? Why did you let those bitches jump you? What? Now we've got nothing. Why did you let them jump you? [Radio chatter] Why did  you  let them jump me? Huh? Why did you let them jump me? That wasn't me. I was never gonna let that happen to me again. I was never gonna let that happen to me again. I was never gonna let someone make me their bitch. Okay. Do you realize... All right. Do you... Shh. I understand. I hear you, okay? Do you? Yes. I'm sorry, okay? I should have been there. [Sighs] I'm gonna do better. Help out more. Get us paid. Eve : [Voice breaking] I didn't think I could do it. I didn't think I could take seeing her like that. [Sniffles] But I just prayed, "God..." Hi, sweetheart. "...give me strength to walk into that room." It's mommy and daddy. "That's your baby girl..." We need to discuss your daughter having been sexually assaulted. Eve : "...And she needs you." [Inhales sharply] Her hand was so warm. There's still life in her. She's gonna survive. She's gonna get through this. I know there's still life in her. There is a reporter who would like to do a story on us. I think it's very important for people to know who our children were and what happened to them. And we have to keep what happened present. That's just... that's... that's a reality. If we don't keep talking about it, in a week o-or two, people will have moved on. [Sniffles] That's not something we're comfortable with. All you have to do is talk about her. Eve... Just say what you said about holding her hand. I see no reason to talk to people about our daughter being violated. None. [Sighs] I'm trying to help. [Engine revving] Roll me up. Turn it off. Turn it off. [Metal clangs] [Grunts] All right, go ahead and close it up. Tomorrow, I need you to take this out and blow out the soot, okay? Okay. You should let Jenny go to the party this weekend. If she wants to go to parties, she need to follow the rules. Yeah, but you always freak out about everything. I freak out? Mijo,  I walked through the door, and she's sitting on the sofa with some boy. And don't tell me they're doing homework. You know, I know you don't believe this... I know you don't... but I used to be a teenager, too. I know how you think. [Knocking] You know,  mijo,  one day... One day, you're gonna have a little girl of your own. And trust me... You're gonna be the same way. No, 'cause when I have my kids, I'm not gonna freak out about everything all the time. Miguel. Hey. What's up, man? Hey, tell your boss the next time he sends me a car not to send it with chunts. I don't want gang tattoos around here. You kidding me, man? Those aren't gang tats. I don't want that around my business. [Chuckles] You want to know what? [Speaks Spanish] You know that? Just tell him. Come on, man. Let's get this out of here, man. ♪  B. Swagg, I'm cutting up  ♪

Why else you got to sneak across the border if you ain't gonna be somebody? Be somebody. Be like you. Living in a rat hole. Rolling some other people's weed... [Sighs] ...And buying some stolen crap 'cause you too lazy to steal yourself. [Smooches] See this one? My weed. This is my joint. And if you don't watch your mouth,  baboso, I'll own your ass, too. Entiendes? Yeah. Yeah. $50 for the headphones. You want cash or weed? Money. Step. Don't forget your phone,  perra. [Vacuum whirring] I-I haven't seen the body yet. I...I don't want to see it. I'm... I'm not gonna remember him like that. Mark : Remember him how you have to. I'm not... [Chuckles] I'm not gonna be one of those... "Sit and look through scrapbooks crying." Now is when Matt needs me, and I have always been there for you two when you needed me. How's dad taking it? And the police are doing nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Oh, Russ said they're... looking for some Mexican. I just, uh... I really need you here. I need you to get here, Mark. I'll fly back as soon as I can. I need somebody else here. Okay, mom. I love you. Oh, honey, I love you, too. [Crickets chirping] [Keys jingle] [Keys jingle, engine turns over] This your car? It's my dad... Well, his garage... Can I get your license and registration? I don't have registration, but my dad told me to take this for... Is this your current address? Yes, sir. Copy that description. All right, stay in your car, please. [Horn honks] [Helicopter blades whirring in distance] [Police radio chatter] [Engine revving] [Siren chirps] [Tires screech] [Police radio chatter] Tony Gutiérrez? Yes, sir? I have some other officers that would like to speak with you. Can I get you to come down and talk to them? Go where? They would like you to come down to the P.D. and speak with them. What for? They just want to ask you a few questions. You can leave your car here. That officer will take care of it. Can I get you to step out of your car, sir? [Police radio chatter] Sir? [Footsteps approach] [Door opens] Tony? I'm Chuck Palmer with the Modesto Police Department. This is John Sanderson. [Door closes] He works with me. Tony, I want you to know your father's already been contacted, and he's on his way down here. While we're waiting, I was hoping we could ask you a couple questions. There's a few things we were hoping you could help us with. What things? Is it okay if we ask you a few questions? Yes, sir. Okay, good. So, the car you were driving when the police pulled you over, that's in possession of your father's garage? Well, me and my dad, we work on it. It's just a hobby. But it's not currently registered for street-legal use? I mean, I was just supposed to blow out the soot. I know I'm not supposed to be on the road with it. Are you and your fa... Am I in trouble? Besides the two of you, does anyone else have access to the vehicle? No. Nobody over the last few days? No. What about Sunday night? Nobody drove it Sunday. What did you do Sunday night? I was at home. Did you watch football? Was it a good game? Did you watch it with your family? It's just my sister and my dad. That's it. So, you watched the game with them. I was in the garage, so I didn't get to watch the game. You were at the garage? Okay, from when to when? I'm not sure. About when to when?

 Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Oh, my God. He was gonna pay. Who cares? What do you mean, "who cares?" I don't care. I don't care. Listen. I don't care. Listen. Whatever I got to do... I'll handle it. Okay? I'm not letting you do that. All right? Barb : It's not real to me yet. The phone rings. I expect it to be Matt. It's people giving me condolences, but I can't take them. [Sighs] He's not... it doesn't... feel like he's gone, so I... I don't know how to take other people's grief? Mr. Skokie, when you got the call from the police, what was your first reaction? Well, they weren't even sure it was him. Uh, so, I had to, uh, fly out. So I was just... I was hopeful, you know? The whole... whole trip over, I was... it was a mistake. You know, I kept telling myself that it was, um... The things I was able to find out about your son... It seems like he was a really good young man. Yeah. [Sighs] Oh, yeah. He was in the military. Is that right? Yeah, he... yes, h-he enlisted right after 9/11. He wanted to do his service. He was in Iraq, and h-he did what was right for people. Married a beautiful young girl... Married his sweetheart. She was a beauty queen, right? She was literally... Y... Gwen, uh, was Miss... She was the runner-up for Miss, uh, Modesto six or seven years ago after Matt's service, right when they moved out here. Perfect couple. He cared. And he was happy. Never mind that he did not have it easy growing up. You and your husband are separated? We're divorced. Me and the boys did not have a lot of money. We didn't have any money. It was hard for me to provide, but Matt, his brother... Um, Matt's brother, Mark, he's in the military, too. H-he's serving right now. They both grew up knowing that they had to be responsible. A-and for s-something like this to happen to Matt... What are the police telling you? Nothing. And they're not doing much of anything. I know the one person they're looking for is an illegal... or something. It just f-figures... M-my son goes off to another country to fight, then he comes home to America, and he gets killed by somebody from another country. Gwen :  I love you. Russ : You don't have to say things like that. You know... you didn't have to tell him we're divorced or that you didn't have money when the boys were young. Say something that wasn't true? It's not what you say, Barb. It's how you say things. It's just... [Sighs] I really don't care. You say it with happiness. I am proud that I was able to take care of my children... Our  children. That I was able to take care of them when you  couldn't... Our Or when you  wouldn't. I'm trying to get people to find out who killed our son. And you sit there, and you... You worry about you. Stop the car. I what? What are you... Stop the car. I'm getting out. I'm gonna get out of the damn car unless... Stop the car. Stop it! [Brakes squeal] [Belt clicks] Stop the car. Barb. Don't you walk away from me. That was 20 years ago. I am not that same person. I am not here for you. Listen, I admit I had some problems. "Problems"? S-s-say what you did! Say what you did! Say what you did! You gambled away everything we had. Then you went and stole so you could gamble some more. Yeah, it was... You were off in Vegas... It was... It was an illness, Barb. Or Reno... It was an illness. It was an addiction... Throwing away all our money. And I got myself help. We had nothing. And now I am recovered! We had nothing, raising those boys by myself in public housing. Do you have any idea what that was like? Huh? [Sighs] A-a white mother and her two white kids... Do you know what those people did to us day after day? Barb. Barb. Do you know how those people treated my boys? Barb. I am here trying to do what I can for Matt! Yeah. And your feelings are hurt over what I say to a reporter? Barb, Barb, come on. Stop saying my name!! Now is easy to be a father, Russ, when all you have to do is stand in front of people and be sad. You think... you think this is easy for me? Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to earn back the love and the trust of our boys... Our  boys! Now get in! [Scoffs] It must have been so hard. Just stay out of my way! Or walk if you want. Honest to God, I don't care. [Door opens] Got Mr. Gutiérrez. Mr. Gutiérrez. Chuck Palmer. Have a seat, please. Mr. Gutiérrez, we appreciate you coming in. Now, your son is not under arrest. Tony agreed to come in and speak with us, and he agreed to answer some questions outside of your presence, okay? Yes. All right. Now, there are a few more questions that we have. Can we get you to help answer a few questions for us? Yes, sir. Okay. Now, your son was stopped driving this car. Is that car in the possession of your garage? [Sighs] I tell him to drive it around the block when he has to, but he knows he's not supposed to be on the street with that. And do you recall personally operating that vehicle outside of your property this past Sunday? Sunday? No. Would anyone else have had access to the vehicle? We have the keys... Nobody else. Well, Mr. Gutiérrez, your son told us that he wasn't at home on Sunday night. Do you recall if Tony was home with you? No, he wasn't at home. Mr. Gutiérrez, do you know where your son was? Well, he told me he was working on the car. Tony, were you working on the car, or were you out riding around in it? Tony was telling us that it's just you at home. Is that right? Yes. My wife and I, we recently separated, so I know how hard it is... No, no, it's, uh, different. We didn't... My wife, Roberta, had a heart... thing. I'm very sorry about that. Mr. Gutiérrez, we need your son to tell us what's going on. If he tells us what happened, if he tells us the truth, then that's that. But if he lies to us, that's going to be a problem. Papi, yo no he hecho nada. Unh-unh. Not like that. If you have something to say, you say it. Are you lying to them? Are you lying? No. So that wasn't our car? I don't know. Everything he's saying... That wasn't our car? Ino hice nada! Stop it! Stop lying! Do you want to go to jail? Huh? Do you want to be another cholo in jail? I want to go home. Then tell the truth. Tell them what happened. I don't know. What did you do? Nothing! You never let us do nothing! I just wanted to make some money for myself! You're gonna blame me? [Slams table] Antonio, was that our car?! Yes. We... we always told him... him and his sister... We always told them, "stay away from gangs. Stay away from drugs." Roberta and I, we came to this country the right way... the right way. And we always told him, "do things the right way." Yes, sir. So, he'll tell you whatever. Whatever it is, he's gonna tell you. [Banging on door] What? Hey, it's Carter. Uh... You don't remember? Sean brought us around, me and my girl aubry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's she at? She wants to come party some. Later, though. Not now. She's not feeling it right now, you know, needs a little helping out. Nah, man, I got nothing. Hey, listen. Hey, oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I, loo... I-I-, uh... Look, I-I don't want nothing for nothing, all right? All right? I just, uh... I want to buy a little now. Then... then Aubry wants to come back and get serious. Yeah? You want something to eat? I got some Chinese in the kitchen. Carter : Nah, man. Just... Just want to do business. That's all. Yeah, yeah. Just hang out a sec. All right. I'll be right here. [Dog barking in distance] [Airplane engine roars in distance] This is all I got right now. That's cool. And, uh, Aubry, she's gonna come by later? Yeah, you know... If she's feeling it. Cool. All right. It's gonna be $40. I'm gonna bring Aubry back. Yeah, she wants to party with you. Yeah, yeah. It's still $40, man. [Sighs] Man, why you come over here wasting my time, man? Go. Come back when you got the money, man, all right? Just... Damn, man. Seriously? [Sighs] Look, man... Just give it to me, okay? Man, please, don't. Please, don't do... [Screams] [Groaning] [Both grunting] Bitch! Give it... to... me! You... white... bitch! Give it! [Groans] [Sighs] [Breathing heavily] I got something for us. What? I told you I was gonna do it, right? Hmm? Mm-hmm. [Sighs] I want to show you something. You know what I got? Open it up. [Laughs] We could put it up with your the collection. Tony : Adam was the first one. Chuck : Adam is...? He's this kid at school. I was showing him the car one day, and... he starts going off. "That's bad. That's sick. I want to drive that." And, you know, I told him, "no, you can't drive it." But then he pulls out $20. I mean, $20 just to take it out riding? I'm cool with that. I mean, a week later, a couple weeks later, h-he comes back around. Another 20 bucks just to take it out riding. So it just got to be a thing. I mean, he had friends and stuff, so I just started... You were renting our car? Let's... talk about Sunday night. Adam, he knows this guy that's looking for a car for the night. And he's wanting to front me $50. I mean, $50. W-what do you need that you don't have? I want to know about this other guy. He shows up. He's for real. You know what I'm saying? He was in a gang? H-he was scary. That's all I know. I mean, he gave me the money. He took the car. I thought he was gonna steal it, but he came back. I mean, after that, he started texting me sometimes... looking for a car. Every time, it was $50. You have the phone were texting him from? I erased them. I still need the phone. Could you wait here, please? [Door opens] Jay : The computer should be back up in a minute. Uh, you mind, uh, just waiting for a little bit more? That's fine. Hey, um, I'm gonna use my phone real quick. All right. [Bell jingles] That's him! [Tires screech] Man : No, I didn't tell you. I had to go to my kid's open house last night. Get some suction in here, please. No, no, it was, like, hours of us sitting on those little stools, you know? [Bullet clinks] [Indistinct talking over P.A.] Chuck : Hector. You hear me? Let me tell you where we are. We've got a witness who can put a car on the scene of a homicide, and we've got somebody who can put you in that car. We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession. I didn't kill nobody. Who did? Why they got to shoot me? Who did? We're pulling your jacket. What are we gonna find? Robbery, assault? I don't do nothing violent. Then there's no problem. [Sighs] What's this car thing about? I just needed wheels, needed to be mobile. What for? Do some hustling, deal some drugs? Look, Hector, it's on somebody else, or it's on you. [Scoffs] There's this black dude. Him and his girl are a couple of meth heads. He's a regular cust. He's always looking to buy. He comes to me Sunday. I get him some. He starts rolling. He wants more, but he's broke. And I tell this fool I can't do nothing for him. And he starts getting puffed up, hyped up, talking about how he's owed, how he needs to settle up a score. Says there's this white guy that owes him. He tells me he can get me paid after. After what? After... that don't matter to me. So, I don't know nothing about it. All I had to do was run him over to Slauson. Tell me... Why they got to shoot me?! [Grunts] What address? I ain't going anywhere with no meth head. I take him over to the mini-mall and hang out. He goes off. Dude comes back. Cash, cards... I don't know how he got it. I didn't ask. You know how to find this guy? You know why you shot me? 'Cause you don't give a damn about me. Yeah. I know where he's at. [Razor buzzing] ♪  You can't fight a war with nobody to fight back  ♪

♪  no one will remember  ♪ Alonzo : And why did you erase those texts, huh? The one's from your phone? 'Cause you knew you were doing something wrong. You knew it. No, I always erase my texts. I know you go through my phone. I'm your father. I want to know what's going on in your life. You treat us like babies. You don't tell me what's going on. You're always checking up on us! You never tell me anything. Chuck : Tony. Could I get you to stand up for me, please? Why? Stand up and put your hands behind your back. W-w-what's going on? You're under arrest for murder. I didn't kill nobody. Man : You have the right to remain silent. W-what? No. No. No, no. He was driving. I didn't kill anybody. No, he was driving the car! That's all he was doing! You never said the words! Papi! He just took the car! Anything you say may be used as evidence against you in a court of law. I didn't kill...   Papi! No, no, no, no. No! Aah! Help me! [Indistinct shouting] Help me! [Ringing] Tanea : Hi, Aubry. My name is Tanea, and I'm gonna be taking care of you today. You look like you're pretty beat up. Can you tell me how this happened to you? Okay, I'm gonna feel your nose and around the front part of your face next, okay? Again, any tenderness? Quinn : You could talk to us. You doing okay? You can help us. Does that hurt at all? Did he do that to you? I'm gonna feel your neck now. You don't have to protect him anymore. You got to start thinking about yourself, not him. Any tenderness through here? [Scoffs] Got some pretty mean scratches here. Chuck : We have four suspects in custody... Two who facilitated and one who we believe is the shooter. We're going to be transferring them to the jail for booking. Did he say why h-he did it? He won't talk. But he did it? Well, a gun was recovered, so we're confident we can make the case. I read where, uh, with the appeals and everything, it can take 12 years maybe to execute somebody. Is that true? We have a long way to go before we even get there. I want to see him. I want to see him. Man : Chuck. Chris Thompson just brought this in. You need to go talk to her. You handle her. I got to get Skokie to talk to Chris. [Buzzer, door opens] [Chains jingling] [Buzzer] [Chains jingle] [Van doors close] Mr. Skokie, this is Chris Thompson, one of our investigators. She has a couple of things she'd like to ask you, if that's okay. Okay. Mr. Skokie, you had a good relationship with your son. You talked to him regularly. Did he ever discuss aspects of his lifestyle with you, or did you ever feel like he wasn't forthcoming with you, that he was hiding something from you? N-no. No, Matt never hid anything with me. We talked all the time. We talked about... We talked about his job, and, uh, you know, I know he was happy with Gwen. Did you ever get the sense that he was involved in drugs? No. No, no. No, no, no, no. I... I would know if he were on drugs. [Scoffs] Mr. Skokie... I mean, you know, t-that's... That's just not... I would know. I would know if my son was having problems. Chuck : We don't know that your son was having personal problems with drugs. What was found... In our search of his property, we recovered a large quantity of crystallized methamphetamine and cannabis. The amount and the way it was packaged and the fact that it was securely hidden indicates that it was not all for his own use. Do you understand what I'm saying? M-m-Matt... Matt and I were close. I mean, I w... I would know something like that. M-Matt would have... would have told me. Would your son have told you if he was a drug dealer? ♪
