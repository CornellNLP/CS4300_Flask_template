 Pastor Bennett : What is the nature of forgiveness? 
 What's the disposition of mercy? 
 It has no weight. It's not coarse, but fine. 
 It's as precious as it is limitless. 
 Daily, for transgressions large and small, we must ask and we must give pardon. 
 Our hearts cannot be sealed, and our empathy cannot be limited. 
 [Father Peña speaking Spanish] 
 True forgiveness is a phenomenal act, but one we each have the capacity to perform. 
 For if we as a people cannot forgive, then we as a people are cursed to hate. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 Hector! 
 [Bangs on door] 
 [Phone rings] 
 Woman :  You have reached the voicemail box for... 
 Mark :  Mark Skokie. 
 Woman :  Please leave a message. 
 [Beep] 
 Mark, now, we need to get together and deal with this... 
 This nonsense. 
 This is not about me. 
 This is... this is not about your brother. 
 Now, you said you were going to be here for Gwen. 
 So think about how she's gonna feel knowing that... 
 That the prosecutors are letting off this... 
 Man :  If you're happy with your message and want to send it normal delivery, press one. 
 [Ringing]  If you want to deliv... 
 Barb :  This is Barb. 
 I can't come to the phone. Leave a message. [ Beep ] Barb, I really, really need to talk to you about what's going on. They called to tell me that they're actually letting that man off. But they're not explaining anything to me, and... Well, [Sighs] They talk to you, Barb. And you damn sure know how to handle them. And so I'm asking you  to please not give up on this. This is important, Barb. Please call me back. Aliyah : Bitch. Filthy bitch. Filthy black bitch. You damn filthy black bitch. What else did they say about me? Hm? Basilah : Terrorist? Oh! [Laughter] I got that at the airport. Mm. [Sighs] I heard things I cannot repeat in a place of worship. What they said, and the arrogance they had when they would say it... The entitlement. They think that they are... You know what? It's all right. [Congregation murmurs agreement] They can talk how they talk. Yeah. Mmhmm. They're not talking that loudly anymore, are they? [Congregation murmurs] Lies come back on the liars. Deceptions come back on the deceivers. Good comes to the righteous. [Congregation murmurs] My brother is a good man. I heard him trashed. I heard him demonized. I heard people saying... [Breathes deeply] Those people saying, "your brother's gonna get exactly what he deserves." He got what he deserves. He walked free. That's right. Yes. [Breathes shakily] You've given me my family back. And I've never been more thankful than I am today. I-i don't know what to say. I-i don't even know what happened. One minute, they got me in a cell, talking about how they going to execute me... The next, I'm standing here. I'm just, uh... Man : Take your time, my brother. Take your time. It's... it's... it's been hard... Carrying other people's Faith. Not used to it. Parts of my life, the past few years, uh, I don't even... I don't even remember all the bad... [Congregation murmurs] [Stammers] Sorry. [Breathes deeply] Sorry. It's just, um... I feel... It's how Aliyah said... Deserving things. [Indistinct conversations] What happened? It's by the grace of Allah you were able to... Man, what the hell happened?! Nobody tells me anything. Nobody  says  anything. They didn't just let me out. What are you  not  telling me? Your girlfriend confessed to the crime. [Indistinct conversations continue] Why would she do that? They let me go just because she said she did it? She didn't just say she did it. She offered up evidence only the killer would know. And she claimed to be the only one there when it happened. Lies come back on the liars. Deceptions come back on... [Indistinct conversations continue] [Breathes shakily] What up, boy? How was juvie? What'd you say? [Chuckles] Yeah, i seen your little video. Think you a badass? [Locker door slams] Oh, you think you a little badass, huh? Come on, man. Let me see what kind of badass you are. Hegera : Words were exchanged. The confrontation between the two students continued to escalate, at which point one of our teachers... What did my son do? It wasn't  what  he did... Did Tony hit this other kid? Did he attack him? [Sighs] Tony didn't do anything. So you're calling me in from my job to tell me that my son didn't do anything? Considering your son's past history... I'm talking about right now. Or every time I hear from you, it's gonna be about this "past history" bull... Tony, let's go. [Footsteps] Aubrey : You came. Yeah. Your sister did it. She got you off. I hope you learn to appreciate her, everything she's done for you. Why'd you confess? Why do you think? I'm not gonna let them kill you. So I got to live to watch you die? They're not gonna kill me. I'm mental. Haven't you heard of all the horrible things my family's done to me? They're not gonna let you out. You do have problems. [Sighs] I don't think they're ever gonna let you out. Even if they give me 15 years, I wouldn't be that old. We'd have a lot of time to be together. Somewhere warm. On a beach. Like in the magazine ad. The one you tore up. You make it sound  so  real. It is. It's what I always loved about you. You could take dreams and make them feel  so  real. When I was a kid, I was kind of a loser. I wasn't cool enough for the other black kids. Too black to hang around the white kids. Never got dates. Never. So I made myself up a girlfriend. And Elaine became... [Chuckles] Elaine? [Laughs] First she was just some bull... in my head, you know? Mm-hmm. Somebody who answered whenever I'd talk to myself. But she got more and more real. Really specific... How she looked, the kind of stuff she was into. She read Chandler and loved Hendrix. And her favorite sport was sleeping. She was as perfect as a girl was ever going to get... Right up until I saw you working a beer at the end of a bar. You and me are beautiful. The drugs made us beautiful. We beat them. The liquor made us feel good. All of them... The racists and the haters. We  are beautiful. A-and we deserve to live like that. It's not real! You can't be the girl in my head, and I can't be the guy you're walking on a beach with in a magazine ad. So you're just gonna run off and find yourself another girl? Never. Never. I think the only other girl I could ever be with is Elaine. You know what? ... that. Your little pretend girlfriend when I'm here trying to give myself to you. You think people got to pay for their sins? We're not done. You know that. Part of me being here, part of me getting healthy is they think I need to have contact with the outside world. So... you can call here and they'll put you through to me. I'm not calling. Yes, you will. You're going to call. You're going to come back to me. Jensen : No touching. And we are going to be phenomenal. I said no touching! Alonzo : Come here, mijo. I want to show you this. Where is it? Outside San Jose. It needs work. [Chuckling] It needs a lot of work. And a lot of money. We'd have to put our savings into it... And sell the house. [Sighs] We'd live in an apartment for a while, just until business picked up. But it will pick up. San Jose, man, that city's growing. You plan on driving to San Jose every day? We'd get an apartment there. You want to move? I want us to get a fresh start. You want to move. The job I have now, working for other people, it's killing me. And I can't keep taking you out of school for something that's not your fault. But everything just got fixed. It didn't get fixed. It's not gonna get fixed. The people here are always gonna be thinking about us different now. Always. I can't have you guys living like... You  can't? You  can't. Can... can we at least just talk about it? I'm not putting us through this anymore. It's a good place. For all of us. It's got three bays. It needs some paint. Plenty of parking. [Knock on door] Where have you been? I've been here. I-I've been calling and calling and c-can I c... Yeah. Just... I meant I'm trying to get you engaged in this thing. I don't care. I saw that son-of-a-bitch prosecutor, and y-you better believe I told him what the hell I thought. I don't care, Russ. You don't care about what happened to Matt? Nothing changes. Matt's still gone. We're losing Mark. What? N... but, no, it doesn't have to be like that. I mean, that's the thing. There's an... there's an answer. I mean, what happened here was horrible, but something can still come out of this. We can start putting our lives back together. I want you to stay in Modesto. Why would I stay? You and me, we've never been closer. That's the truth. We can be here with... With Mark and Richelle. Mark and Richelle are going back to Germany. They don't want anything to do with us. Oh, Mark. You know, I mean, he's just... he's... He's going through a... No, it's not a stage. We got it wrong with him. Mark wanted to help Gwen. That, he would do. So, they... They can stay in the house. Russ... And you should see it. Barb, it's beautiful. I mean, I really just put everything... Matt was killed there. Well, you can't tell. I mean, it's new floors, new paint. I mean, it's a  real  home. Gwen is going back to Oakland with Tom and Eve. They're selling the house. Well, no, they can't do that. I'm going back to Simi Valley. Mark and Richelle are going to Germany. The only thing that was keeping us here was something brutal. It's behind us, and we're scattering. We need to. We need to be away from each other. You need to be away from Mark? You... you believe that? It's how it is. "It's how it -" I accept it. Whwhat is that? You don't have to accept it. Y-you... we can... we can be however we want to be. Uh, I mean, I'm not kidding myself that it's gonna be easy or perfect, and I know the past isn't just done. But we've... we've got to fight for this family. Let go. No, but, uh, we need to be together. I mean, I just... I feel that... Whatever you think is back there, stop trying to hold onto it. Well, this isn't about the past. I'm not trying to make up for anything or re-live anything. I've been sitting in his room. It's empty and it's lonely and it hurts. But... this is... Don't be lonely. It's the  truth,  Russ. No. No. No. No. Don't be lonely, Barb. Don't be. There... there's something... There's something else for us. There is. [Smooches] Let go. [Sniffles] 
 
 [Buzzer] [Man speaking Spanish] [Gavel bangs] [Whispers indistinctly] [Indistinct conversations] Hector. [Phone ringing] [Answering machine beeps] Russ :  Tom, it's Russ. I wanted to let you know I heard you might be selling the house. Well, you should look at it. You can't even tell something bad happened here. Look, I put a lot of work into it. I wish somebody was just willing to try as hard for this family as I am. Yeah, and I just... I feel like I'm all alone out here. [Sighs] Oh, geez. [Sighs] [Voice breaking] Take care of your family, Tom. All the best with Gwen. I like when dad drives. Feels safe. ♪ I lost all of my innocence ♪ 
♪ when I fell in love in with you ♪ Can I get a pbr? ♪ I never knew a man fall so far until I landed here ♪

♪ Hannah, won't you come home to me ♪

Patient's name? Hello? Yeah. Hello? Aub... Aubry Taylor. One moment. I'll ring you through. [Ringing] Aubrey : Hello? Yeah, Au... [Gunshot] Hello? Hello? Carter? [Eerie ringing] [Sirens wail in distance] [Tires screech] [Officer speaking indistinctly] [Muffled] Drop your weapon! Put the gun down now! I'm not gonna ask you again! Drop the weapon! [Normal voice] Drop your weapon! Woman : Wyatt, have you seen where Dr. Rose is? Man : All right, this guy's bleeding. We got to get started. Yeah, I'm ready to go. Gunshot wound is through... [Overlapping chatter] That's good, guys. Oh, my god, his blood pressure's dropping. Okay. Get the pressure up. He's not looking good. The patient's flatlining. Hey, Jim? We got no pulse. We got nothing. We got three doses of epi. What time is it? 6:30. Yeah, why don't we call it now. There's nothing else we can do. Yes, sir. We did our best, guys. [Monitor flatlining] Woman : Liz, you want to call security to meet us in the morgue? [Beep] What? What? Something happened to your boyfriend. Something? He was shot. Can I see him? He didn't make it. Tell the doctors to do something. There's nothing to do. They worked on him. Well, go t-tell them to do something else. Doctors say people are dead all the time, and they're not. Go tell them to do something! Didn't matter what I confessed to. You wanted him. You happy now? I'm sorry for you. Oh, no, you're not. You come around here and make me think you give a... about me. Nobody ever wanted us to be together! Nobody ever wanted it! [Sobbing] This whole thing happened because nobody wanted us to be together! Nobody wants us to be together. Alonzo : Okay, what's here? What's here that you want to stay in Modesto over someplace else? I don't want to keep running away from things all the time. That's what this family does. Run away from Modesto, run away from Mexico. We didn't run away from Mexico. Well, you went somewhere else 'cause you wanted something else. You stay here, then what? You know Carlos. You're staying here for Carlos? I'm not staying for Carlos. His family has a restaurant. They have a restaurant? Really? [Laughs] You don't know that? They said I can work there, make money, pay for school. Well, that's why I'm trying to start a new business, mija. I can make good money. I'll pay for your school. You don't have to. I  want  to. [Chuckles] But I don't have to. [Dog barking in distance] Maybe I would stay a little bit for Carlos. You guys are so young. How old were you when you married mom? When you left Mexico? [Laughs] You did all of that, and you guys turned out good. [Sighs] All I want to do... I want to stay in Modesto. What are you thinking? I don't even know. I'm feeling, uh... You should feel happy. You raised us to take care of ourselves. I got this. [Laughs] Ay. You know, not too long from now, your little girl is gonna be sitting here and telling you, "you should be happy," because she... She's going away. I'm not going away. [Chuckles] [Sighs] Your mom would be proud. [Sighs] [Door opens] [Babies crying] [Breathing shakily] [Sobbing] [Gasps] Ah! I-i-i... I need help. I-i need help. I-i need help! I need... I need help! Get a doctor! I need help. I need help. He's breathing. I need a doctor in here! I need help. I need a doctor in here! I need a doctor in here! Do something! Sir! Do something! Do something! Sir, if you can hear me, nod your head. Good, good, good. Stay with me. Keep breathing. Okay, i need a doctor in here! Sir, stay with me. Stay with me. Keep breathing. Keep breathing. I need a doctor in here now! Stay with me. Stay with me. I need a doctor in here! Get a doctor in here now! Sir, stay with me. That's it. Come on. Stay with me. Stay with me. Keep breathing. Keep breathing. Stay with me. Come on. Come on, keep breathing. Sir... I need a doctor in here! I need a doctor in here now! I need a doctor in here! Someone get a doctor in here! I need a doctor now! Somebody get a doctor in here! I need the crash cart! She doesn't have a pulse! I need a crash cart now! Get a doctor! [Police radio chatter] [Sobs] [Breathing shakily] Innaa lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji'oon. [Crying] [Sobs] Palmer : Someone inside the room is going to pull back the blind, and you're going to see a table with a body on it. I need you to tell me if the body you see is your husband. Let me know when you're ready. You know that's him. I still need you to identify the body. That's... Russ. What happened? It was self-inflicted. Mark : What are you gonna do with the body? What am I gonna do with your father? I suppose... Oakland. With your brother. Eve was saying I should go back to Oakland. Okay. Well, I guess, uh [Sighs] We should call the funeral home there and... "We"? We can help you make plans. You know, I can talk to our C.E.O. and... Weren't you very desirous of being done with your father and your racist mother? It's all been... It's a... show. Let's just... It's over now. Okay. Okay, if this is what you want. [Scoffs] This is what I want. [Sighs] [Keys clink] [Sighs] [Running footsteps] Richelle : Mrs. Hanlon! Mom! I-i dropped... my... Barb. [Breathing heavily] It's got to stop. We can't keep burying this family. You still got a son. We're gonna have children. And you deserve to be in their lives. And they deserve to be better than we've been. Y-you got to decide what you want from this life. If you want to hate, you're gonna hate alone. [Speaking indistinctly] [Indistinct conversations, phones ringing] [Speaking Spanish] [Man speaks Spanish] Sí. [Speaks Spanish] [Conversing in Spanish] Sí. So, we are opening a new call center, and we are looking to expand our business further into north America... The United States, Canada. Sure. Being bilingual is important for this job, but you are also going to be the primary contact between the customer and the business. Right. So it is also important that the people we bring on are not only versed in answering the customer's questions, but representing the company in the best way. I-i think I can do that. See, one of the reasons I really want this job, i-i know your company is growing, and i-i know there would be an opportunity to... You were previously arrested? Yes. And have you ever been involved in cartels, gangs? I mean, not... not anymore. Not anymore? So, your last full-time job, you...? Never. But you're not part of gangs anymore? Wow. My girlfriend, right? See, she asked me if I was tired of my life. Getting cut up, getting shot. I tell you for real... [Voice breaking] I'm not tired of my life. I'm... I'm worn out. See, I know people come in here all the time, ask you to take a chance on them. Tell you how they changed. See, I don't know from other people, what makes them do how they do. But I'm 26 years old, and all I got to show for my life is a limp and a scar, and a 5-year-old girl who needs her daddy to live straight. I'm part of nothing anymore. I'm just trying to get a job. [Sighs] What's the most education you've had? Man, I had a little bit of high school. But... but I like to read a lot. What do you read? [Car door opens] [Engine turns over] [Seatbelt clicks] [Speaks Spanish] We have to keep talking English now. I need to keep practicing. [Speaks Spanish] What'd I say? In English. You got it! Aah! Mwah! It's good! Yeah. I mean, the best part is, right, like, every month, they have, like, a, like a review. So, like, every month, you... You could get a promotion. [Chuckles] Wow. That's good. [Both sigh] You know what? We should go to the store. I mean, I need a new shirt. I want to look good on the first day of work. [Chuckles] You're gonna be on the phone. You don't need a new shirt. I mean, I know, but, uh... But I feel like a new shirt. You know, I feel, uh... How do you feel? Hm? I feel...
