 This is Chuck Palmer with the city of modesto robbery/homicide division. 
 You're going to see a table with a body on it. 
 I need you to tell me if the body you see is your son. 
 That's Matt. 
 Is Gwen dead? 
 Gwen's at the hospital. 
 There are indications she was sexually assaulted. 
 Have you called his mother yet? 
 Well, what are the police doing? 
 Chuck : We have four suspects in custody... 
 Two who facilitated and one who we believe is the shooter. 
 Mr. Nix, you are charged with first-degree felony murder. 
 Bail is denied, and you are remanded to the custody of the sheriff. 
 Quinn : We want your testimony. 
 Aubry : Screw that. 
 They're cutting me loose. 
 The judge gave you probation, and when you break it, you're gonna be right back here. 
 I need money. 
 Michael : If I send you money, will you call and tell me where you are? 
 [Voice breaking] I'll call. 
 We'd like Matt to be buried close. 
 Where? 
 In Oakland. 
 And you have just as much a claim on your son's body as Barb does. 
 Gwen's rape kit came back negative. 
 She wasn't assaulted? 
 No, they don't think it was rape anymore. 
 A warrant's come up for you in Mexico. 
 You're wanted for murder. They're sending you back. 
 You got to do something to fight that. 
 I can't. 
 Hayes : Tony's gonna be charged with murder. 
 Alonzo : He didn't do anything. 
 He made voluntary statements. 
 No, but the police lied to me. 
 Why didn't you tell Tony to ask for a lawyer? 
 I didn't know. 
 Laura :  Thank you so much for waking up with us. 
 I'm Laura. Ryan :  This is Ryan. Right now, we're tweeting with all of you, and, uh, we've got to respond to a few tweets. Yes, we do. It's been... it's been a little while. [Chuckles] Yes, it has. We invite you to join the conversation using our hashtag, and we look forward to chatting with you guys this morning, as always. Yeah, and, uh, we started this morning out kind of warm today. Yeah, we are. There's a lot of sports events going on this weekend. Uh, let's check on the forecast with Nathan. How are we looking out there? Woman :  Doctors at Valley Hospital reported no improvement in the condition of Gwen Skokie, the wife of murder victim Matt Skokie, nearly a month after the two were attacked in a home-invasion-style robbery. Two men and a juvenile offender remain in custody awaiting trial. Community leaders have asked police to re-evaluate... [Radio turns off] [Muffled music playing] Jenny! ♪  In every part of the country  ♪ [Muffled music continues] Jenny, I got to head out! ♪  It was me, it was me,   it was me  ♪ Jenny! [Birds chirping] [Dog barking] [Indistinct shouting] [Man speaks Spanish] [Shouting continues] Man : Get your man, get your man. Let's go, baby. [Indistinct conversations] Man, get off me, man. Man 2 : Nice, nice! Right here, right here. I'm open. Right here, baby. Hustle. Okay, you got it. Aah! Silk : Yo, Tina! Come play some ball. You can be on my team. Tina! Take your shirt off. We're skins. Take your shirt off. We're skins. Look at them te-tahs, boys. [Laughter] Yeah. You ready? Let's play. Right here. Ball in. [Groans] [Distorted] Damn, bro, you got to have better hands. You got to be able to catch. Come on, girl. Get up. Let me play some. Let me throw  you  the ball. No, I'm cool. You don't want me to throw you one? Yeah, hell, yeah, you don't. Man : You soft, man. [Breathing heavily] Come on. Get up. Get up. Yo, stop crying. Don't be a bitch. Rick : For everyone in this office, your son's case is a priority. From the district attorney himself to all his deputies... Thank you. Our only goal is a conviction. Thank you. This is about more than a murder conviction to me. Ms. Hanlon asked our organization to help her advocate for her son and his wife. We believe special circumstances need to be added to the charge. Well, special circumstances are automatic... Murder in the course of a robbery. No, no, no. My son's murder wasn't just about a robbery. My son was targeted because of his race. Okay, that's... This is from the arrest report. "One of the coconspirators made a statement that the killer said, 'I have a score to settle with a white dude.'" that's an identifier. It'd, uh... it'd be a challenge to use that to prove bias. Well, the shooter was arrested for assault a year ago... a fight in a bar. The victim was white. In the altercation, he's quoted as saying to the victim, "you white..." I'm not gonna use the word. "You white 'b, ' I'm going to kill you." Uh, he also screamed in the bar "all you white MFs need to go." And that's more than an identifier. What he said are provocative statements, absolutely. But they don't rise to the level of a bias-motivated crime. He said he hates white people, he said whites need to die, then he killed a white person. What else does he have to do? The connection's circumstantial. If a white person said he hated blacks, then shot a black, you know you would charge him with a hate crime. You know it. So one rule for them, one rule for us? We don't deserve to be treated equal? In terms of strategy, we want to be careful not to appear overzealous. Overzealous to who? I haven't buried my son yet. His wife's still in the hospital. So I don't see how you could be zealous  enough. When we said we were ready to advocate, we meant it publicly. That's crap. If you're threatening to start banging the drum because we don't fall into line... Rick, I've been in this office a dozen times. I'm not pushing for anything that I haven't before. A biased, motivated crime is a crime against the community. Nancy, I know how the law reads. That man needs to be convicted for what he did to us. That's  the message you need to send. Anything you want to tell me about yourself? Not a lot to tell. I'm not married. I ha... I have a son, Mark. He's overseas in the military. So, you have retail experience? Yeah, I had about six years at my last job... Hardware, home improvement. Three years ago, I started working in the garden center there. And, boy, uh, you know, growing things, seeing them, you know... I mean, I... that I love. I really got into that. So, you're from Arizona? I live there. Do you plan on moving to Modesto? I, uh... well, I had some, uh... I had some family issues here, and I, um... I couldn't get back to work, and they... well, I got laid off. So, are you, uh, going back to Arizona, or are you moving to Modesto? I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's gonna happen in a month, in a couple of months, and I just know I... I need to be here now, and to be here, I need a job. I... I could really use a job. Well, we have a lot of applications. Oh, r-right, sure. But we'll be making a decision soon. Sure. Thanks for your time. Yep, yep, sure. Appreciate it. Uh, thanks... thanks for your time. [Birds chirping] [Banging in distance] Hector : [Grunting] [Screams] Dr. Jones : The wound is healing really well, but the muscle graft is gonna reduce your mobility. Once the damaged bone in the femur fuses, you're not gonna have any issues supporting your own weight, but the healed leg is going to be about one to two millimeters shorter than the other leg, and that's gonna give you a limp... A noticeable one. When are they gonna sign me out of here? I don't think you're gonna need any more surgeries... Probably five weeks, six at most. When my leg's good, they're deporting me. Can you do anything? I could make you better in four weeks. I could do that. Go talk to the other punk. He's in gangs. He's in drugs. He's illegal. You see, those are the ones... Always make the rest of us look bad. [Rewinding] He's illegal. You see, those are the ones... Always make the rest of us look bad. That's good. Go with that. [Rewinding] He's illegal. You see, those are the ones... Always make the rest of us look bad. [Sniffs] Say... You run with los cuetes? That's old news. "Old news"? Bro, that ain't old news. Heard the doc say you gonna be up in here six weeks. Maybe. Yeah. You're gonna be in here six weeks, you need to be productive. See all these meds they got? Get busy with those, yo. [Scoffs] Busy how? By not being a dumb-ass. By figuring some stuff out and getting at 'em. That's money, player. You get at 'em, send somebody around you can slip 'em to. Entiendes? Yeah. Yeah. You cuetes, boy. Be productive. [Sighs] Diane : Okay, how's that? [Soft music plays] [Sighs] It's... Do you want to see the back? I can show you the back. Unh-unh. Can you take it down? Take it down? Yeah. Do you want it shorter? No, just take it... C-calm it... calm it down. It's too... it's just too fluffy. It's... it's not  too  fluffy. It... Well, I just said it was. I come to the one in Simi Valley all the time. It's the same place. It's the same company. How come you can't cut and do my hair the same way? Okay, okay, I-I-I'll fix it. It's no... it's no problem. I can fix it. I'll fix it for you. It's not a big deal. No, it's... Now, it's all ri... it's... It's oka... it's all right. Simms : That a new haircut? 'Cause it completely changes your look, Ms. Hanlon. Is that your name... Barbra Hanlon? Okay, look, I'm serving you with a notice of petition to take possession of the remains of Matthew Skokie. What? What?! You're not... you're not... No... no, you're not. You're not taking my... You're not taking my son anywhere. Russ Skokie's doing it. I'm just serving papers. Uh... he... You're served, okay? [Papers clatter] I'm not taking that! You didn't serve me! Did you tell anybody what happened? You have to tell somebody. They don't care. Stuff happens all the time. They don't care. I'm supposed to see your parole officer, or whatever. Don't tell him. Why not? I don't need help, all right? I got somebody looking out for me. Got  who  looking out for you? Somebody who's looking out for me. You know what? That's what got you in trouble in the first place. Papi  got me in trouble. You got  yourself  in trouble. You got in trouble 'cause you're dumb. You're dumb,  papi's  dumb... I do dumb stuff? I know about what you do with Carlos when papi's not around. Shut up. You're nosy. Then don't be out in public. Shut up. You're like a freak. Punk. [Both laugh] [Snorts] Papi  wants to visit. No. Then you call him. You tell him you... You tell him. Why you got to let me deal with everything? Don't deal with it. Don't deal with  papi. I don't. Don't worry none about me. I don't need you worrying about me. Aubry : I see a better life. You know? That's it. That's why I do it. When you get high, you look out a window, or in the mirror, or look at a magazine ad, life looks better... Or... slower, or has more color. Something. It's just not... regular. I can't be regular. And I don't get down on people who want to live regular. That's their thing. So I don't know why people get down on me for being how I am. I just want to live how I live. But, uh, live this life, sometimes bad things come your way. That's when you get a little desperate. [Voice breaking] That's when you could use some helping out, so, you know... That's how it is right now. I could use some helping out. What happened? Got arrested. [Sighs] For what? For nothing. They put me on probation. For  what? The guy I'm with, he got busted for murder. They said he raped a girl and shot her. Oh, God. Well, let's go. Get your things, and let's go. I can't go anywhere. I'm on probation. If I leave, they'll put me in jail. Don't. I hate it when you do that. I just... I can't understand why you want to be around people like that, why you choose people like that over your own family! You're not my family. No. No, you're the one. You always push against us. I need a lawyer. You said you were on probation. Yeah, so they won't let me see Carter, and I need a lawyer to work something out. Your mother and your brother are coming. I don't want to see them. They want to see you. They  care  about you a hell of a lot more than some... some thug... Would you quit your job for me? What?! Would you split on the girl you were gonna marry? Would you take a knife to the ribs trying to protect me from some coked-up ass-wipe who wanted to use me for a joy...? No, all you want... You want to put me on meds, want me to smile like a... zombie so people don't think you brought home some crazy, little bitch from foster care. Your boyfriend killed someone. He didn't do anything. How do you know? I know. Right. All right. You're gonna get counseling, and you are going to engage your mother and your brother when they get here. You want help, you want to take things  from  me, you're gonna do things  for  me. And... You're gonna get rid of those clothes. I could smell you from the hallway. [Laughs] [Speaks Spanish] It's a selfie! Ohh! [Speaking Spanish] Let... let's take one. Let's take one. All right. [Speaking Spanish] [Laughs] No! Not that way! This way. Like that. Extend your arm. [Both laugh] Try it. So, you weren't gonna call or anything? There's no reason. Tony's in jail. He's not in jail. He's in trouble. And that's something I have to deal with. But not by yourself,  carnale. Jenny said that the police got Tony to say a bunch of stuff... And that you were there when they did it. See, that's the reason I didn't call you. What? I'm not accusing you. I'm just asking. The hell you aren't. Jenny stands in there. She's screaming at me, telling me that I act all white, that I want to be white. Where does she get that crap, huh? She doesn't get that from you? Oh, and what color were the cops? [Sighs] Were they white? So you got some white cops questioning your brown boy, and you don't do anything about it? You don't say anything? I don't teach my kids to hate. I'm not talking about hate. I don't teach my kids to hate the police But you'd better teach them that they're Mexicans... or anybody else... because they have different-color skin. They're mexicanos, to a whole lot of people, and that's all they're ever gonna be. Ah, but you don't have kids. How would you know what to teach them? [Scoffs]  Vato,  I know about that SB 1070 down in Arizona. I know that. I know about stop and frisk. I know that if you're some kid who comes here from Central America, they'd rather ship you out than show you compassion. [Scoffs] And when I saw you on TV, blaming illegals... Really,  vato?  [Scoffs] Why buy that kind of trouble for yourself? The raza don't forget that kind of talk,  carnale. That punk who got Tony in trouble... Is he legal or no, huh? And I'm supposed to forget that because we have the same color skin? No. I'm Mexican-American. He's just Mexican. That's the difference between me and him... And me and you. I-I'm not trying to fight. I'm trying to help. Tony's in trouble, and I'm telling you this as your brother-in-law. I'm telling you this as  familia. You need to wake up. Don't come around here drinking beers in front of my daughter again. [Door opens, closes] Gwen never signed a consent form, so... So we can't legally look at her e-mails. What, uh... What do you expect to find in the e-mails? The truth. I mean, the police insinuating that Gwen was with other men... [Sighs] Matt never said anything to you, did he? I mean, you were asking me the other day if they were happy together. He nev... Uh, no, he never said anything. If we can all come together before a judge, and if we can show a common cause... It's not a good time for me right now. I, uh... I've got to get a job, and you already got me fighting with Barb over Matt's body. We're all in on that. Yeah, I'm the one who has to sit down with her. It's time for you to be the father. Okay, stop it. I know. Stop. That's enough. We're gonna... I-I-I-I'm not... No, you've gone... I'm not meaning that as an insult. It's... Russ has admitted he wasn't there for his kids. That's too far. I mean, y-you said that. I'm gonna wait in the car. You weren't there for your kids, but you're here now. Now, you bet I'm gonna do what I got to do. 
 
 Eve : You don't have to speed. Tom, you don't have to speed! He told us to be there by 3:00. Got to get the paperwork filed this afternoon. I'm not waiting around till next week to file some forms. I don't like what's going on. Well, I don't like it either. It's ridiculous. Having to go through a court to get in our daughter's e-mail. No, that's not what I meant. Yeah, I suppose if it was regular mail just lying around our house, we'd have to have some judge... I don't like what's going on with you. Gwen's still in the hospital. Can we please just focus on her? They say she was raped. They say she wasn't raped. That's for the police to find out. I don't like Barb. She's putting us through hell about Matt's burial, but she came here with the right attitude. [Sighs] Fierro : As Tony's probation officer, I need to ask you some questions about the case. How do you feel about your father, Jenny? What does that mean, "how do I feel about him"? Well, with everything that's happened, how do you feel about your home situation? It's okay. Who do you blame for what happened? Thought you were supposed to ask me about Tony. What's going on at home has a whole lot to do with Tony. So how's the situation? It's cool. Everything's cool. You should send Tony on home. It's good. Tony had it good. Only thing  papi  did wrong... Did Tony tell you? Mami  died. And  papi...  You know, you lose somebody, you don't want to lose anyone else. Tony was the baby. Papi  treated him like a baby, like he never wanted Tony to grow up. But that doesn't play with a boy who's about to be 16, so... that's how that went. Is it going that way with you? I had to grow up quick... Taking care of Tony, taking care of the house, always taking care of everything. Now with all this sh... [Horn honks] Stuff, I got to take care of everything else. Probably didn't leave a lot of time for you to be you. Does how I grew up... Is that gonna make a difference about Tony coming home? No. Then you should ask me something else. Michael : You got very lucky... very lucky. I know. And I don't just mean this time, with this guy, you not ending up in jail. I know. You've been lucky in life. The reason your mother and I took you... She's not my mother. The reason we took you in was to give you a chance. You had one a lot of kids never get. This time can't be like every other time. Well... I disappoint. It's what I do. I'm not asking for my sake. I'm not asking for me. Do good for yourself. It takes time. I'm trying, okay? I called you because I want to try. Debbie : I am not seeing anything under, uh... That is my first name. It would be under my last name. Last name, Sh... Shadeed, yes. [Chains clanging] [Buzzer] [Door opens] As-salaam alaikum. [Buzzer] Hey. [Door closes] How are you doing? Happy Birthday. Forgot about that. No one forgets their birthday. I'm not trying to remember mine. Same thing. How did you find out about me? Celeste. She e-mailed me. What did they charge you with? A bunch of stuff. For murder. I'm gonna get you a lawyer. I got a lawyer. No, I'm gonna get you a lawyer that's working for a cause, not a dollar. I'm willing to do that for you. I'm willing to fight for you, Carter. But I won't do it for nothing. You have to do some things. You can't keep living like this. You have to change, and change begins when you humble yourself, when you beg forgiveness. I'm not begging you for nothing. I'm not the one. Only Allah forgive... Seriously?! Kill that. Why is that wrong? Why is it wrong to believe in something that's bigger than yourself? 'Cause I don't believe in that crap, and I don't need that stuff to get by. Then what do you need, drugs? You need s*x with little white girls? And you wonder why you're accused. You take their drugs, you sleep with their women, and then they put you in their cage. Don't come in here with your fake-ass religion nonsense. What I believe is real. Real? [Sighs] Real? [Chuckles] Are you for real, Doreen? That's your name. That's your  real  name. Not Aisha, Ashante... Aliyah. Whoever you pretend to be. Doreen Nix, the name that mommy and daddy gave you. Aliyah is who I've become, and there is nothing fake about it. I embrace who I am. You can't even celebrate your birthday. The candles on your cake are like a light shining on all the years you've wasted, everything you've walked away from, Carter... A good woman of color who could have become your wife, a good job. A good job? Adding up numbers for the department of water and power. A civil servant, man? You lived all right. It was like a collar on my throat. It wouldn't choke me to death, wouldn't let me breathe right, neither. So you left Celeste and quit your job so you can get high and screw? And where is she? Where's your little girl, Carter? You're in here, and they let her go. And who else is fighting for you? 'Cause all I see is a whole lot of people trying to kill you. Confess your sins, beg for forgiveness, and then I can help you. [Chair creaks] I need you to find Aubry and tell her to stay cool until I get back with her. But I'm not gonna beg you to do it, but I'll ask you. No. You don't know the crap they do to me just so I can come in here and see you. So don't come around anymore! [Chair thuds] Come get me out of here! Come get me! [Buzzer] [Door opens] [Buzzer] [Door closes] [Sighs] [Sighs] Ms. Hanlon, we appreciate you meeting with us. We appreciate your willingness to come discuss the situation. Uh, we really hope that we can all just work together to come to a resolution that's agreeable to everyone. What would be agreeable is that we plan for Matt and Gwen to be together. They deserve it. Tom and Eve want it. And you're the only one against it. We're asking you, all of us are asking you, to please just let it go. And I-if you can't, then... Then we're gonna fight you on this. Barb : I'm here, Russ. You got me to come and sit across from you. Doesn't that mean anything? That's a good g-gesture. "Gesture"? Good gesture, but it means something if you're willing to do what's right. So if you're really ready to discuss... There's no discussion if you've already decided what's right. Matt's not going back to Simi Alley with you. You're really gonna drag our son's dead body around just so you can feel good about yourself? [Sighs] Is there anything... is, uh... Is there any way we can begin to start to come to some sort of resolution about this? Uh, could you accept, uh, that until your son's wife is able to make a decision, uh, that your son's body be kept in storage, uh, in... in a... Storage? In... in a neutral location. Seriously? [Sighs] I... thought when you got arrested at the house, back when we still had a house, that that was the worst thing you could do to us. They took him away right in front of the children... For petty theft. You couldn't even steal right. There are four of us on one side. Four? What four? Gwen... Gwen would want this. [Laughs] You don't know your own kids, but you know what a woman in a coma wants? There's us, Barb, and then there's you. How do you think that's gonna look to people? How do you think it's gonna look? People are already trying to blame the victim, blame our son. Do you care about that? Do you... do you care about that? No, of course you don't, b-because you never did. I care. I care enough to want to know what was going on with our son. If he were using drugs... If... If he were selling drugs... If Matt were using drugs, where did he get that from? Who brought that into our family? Who brought addiction into our family? You're awfully quiet. Mark told me you lost your job. I know you don't have any money. You were never good about money. How long can you afford to stay here? How long can you afford a lawyer? You can't, so you'll run off. [Sighs] You used to scare me, Barb. That's the only good trick you had. Carlos : What are you doing? You want to hang out? Jenny : I got homework. Well, not right now. There's a party tonight. What party? It's a block party. It's cool. School night. Just come for a while. Nena can come. Nena : [Laughing] I don't want to go to some block party. Just shut up and come. Bring Jenny. Maybe. Just come. Maybe. Go away. I'm gonna see you tonight. [Both laughing] Tom : Yes, absolutely. Never let it be said prayers aren't answered. That was our lawyer. We got to be in his office early in the morning. It seems that he knows somebody. He's a judge or something. But this guy can help us get the paperwork signed off on. So prayers answered. [Sighs] If you... Found things in Gwen's e-mails... If you knew she was seeing other men... Could you deal with it? Well, was she having an affair? It wasn't really an affair. You're gonna have to be a little more clear than that. Gwen said she needed to be with other men. How long? She felt very lonely. How long have you known? Things got worse when Matt got into drugs. Drugs? [Breathing shakily] How long have you known these things? I've been helping her through this. Helping her? Our daughter is sleeping with other men, our son-in-law's high on drugs... You're helping? You let me think that she was raped. I didn't know until the test came back! You still didn't say anything! So you could do what you're doing, so you could go insane?! I am desperate to find out what went wrong with our daughter. I'm desperate. Now, since you seem to have knowledge, who exactly were these other men? Were they random? Were they strangers? Just guys she picked up? Did she know them at least? Please tell me that she knew them. One of them was someone from work. And the other one? I don't know who the other one was. She just said she wanted gratification, that she wanted to be with somebody! She couldn't be with her husband? Things were not working for them. Matt had problems. He was doing things. He was around people that scared Gwen! [Inhales sharply] I talked with Russ. We... We sat, and we talked about our children. He never said anything about Matt, never said anything about problems. Gwen wanted out of the marriage. I told her to stay. She was getting him help. She was trying to help Matt. You told her to stay? She took a vow, "for better or for worse." Vows are sacred, Tom! Then why didn't you tell me any of these things? She came to me as a woman, as a wife. She begged for confidence. It's what Gwen wanted. You don't give children what they want. You give children what they need. [Clatter, keys jingle] [Indistinct conversations] [Dance music playing] Woman : Come over here. Hey! [Indistinct conversations continue] [Cheering] Woman : Hey. What's going on? [Laughter] [Indistinct conversations] Nena : Ah. Look who it is. [Laughter] Hey, what's up? What's going on? Hey. What's up, man? How's it going? Nice ride. I know. [Indistinct conversation] Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no. No. You need to... you need to dance. All right, dance to this song. Dance to this song right now. [Siren chirps] [Door opens, closes] [Music plays in distance] Barris : What are y'all doing? Marco : Hanging out. Hanging out, huh? You drinking? I'm 21. Need to see some I.D. All of you, let's see some I.D.s. We weren't drinking, just him. Still need to see some I.D. [Indistinct conversations in distance] [Police radio chatter] You got I.D.? Yes. Let me have it. No. What? I wasn't doing anything. I didn't ask you what you were doing. I asked to see some I.D. What was I doing wrong? Tell me, what was I d... You looking for a problem?! Are we gonna have a problem here? [Police radio chatter] Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time, and then I'm not asking anymore. Let me see your I.D.  Now. Nena : Jenny. Just give him your license. Let me see your I.D.  Now. Just give it to him. Jenny. Five-five-Charlie to dispatch. I need you to run a DMV check on, uh, Jennifer Gutiérrez. Keal : Keep your hands down. [Beep] Man: Dispatch to five-five-Charlie. No wants, no warrants. Five-five Charlie, copy. That was a lot of crap for nothing. Next time you give me a lot of crap for nothing, there's gonna be something, understand? Yeah. Hey, understand? Yes. You might want to get off the streets. [Doors open, close] Woman : Whoo-hoo! [Engine turns over] [Vehicle departs] [Breathes deeply] [Sighs] Alonzo : Jenny. Yeah? Where were you? With friends. Well, if you're gonna be out this late, I need you to... My phone died. Look, I don't care that you were out with friends. I just... I-I want to make sure you're safe. I can take care of myself! I know you can. I can, so I don't need you telling me what boy I can hang out with, and not to drink, and what to wear, and... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did something happen? [Sighs] Jenny? No matter what I say or... Or what I do, it just sets you off. I walk around the house, and I'm afraid to say anything to you,  mija. Do you know how hard it is for me not... [Sniffles] Mija.  Oh. [Sobbing] We're gonna get through this, okay? Tony's gonna come home, and we're gonna be good. I promise. I promise. [Sniffling] [Birds chirping] [Cellphone rings] [Beep] Hello. Hello? Barb. Barb, it's Nancy. Yes. Yes. I-I talked to the deputy district attorney. He's not gonna pursue special circumstances. Barb? Yes. I'm sorry. This should have been a victory for your son. Thank you. Thank you for calling. [Beep] Alonzo : I-I want the same as everybody else... What's best for my child. That's all I care about... What's best for Tony. Mr. Gutiérrez... No, let me... let me say this. You don't know how hard this is has been. I haven't been away from my kids, not one day, since they lost their mother... Nine years... Raising two kids alone, and running the shop alone... No breaks, no time away. And to have him away from me, for the first time, like this... Mr. Gutiérrez, the police, they believe Tony had no direct knowledge of the murder. As for me, I... I have no intention to refer your son's case to the district attorney. But, sir, you have to understand that Tony knew that what he was doing was most likely illegal. He enjoyed doing something that he knew would agitate or aggravate you. There's something going on with Tony, and right now I don't believe that home is the best environment for him. No, it's our home. How can our home not be the... Tony needs counseling, sir. He needs interdiction. I-I can do that. I can get him counseling. Mr. Gutiérrez... I can get him help. Your son doesn't even want to visit with you, okay? How are you going to help him if he doesn't want to talk to you? What's best for Tony, for your son, is an environment where he can be observed by trained professionals. I promised Jenny that he was gonna come home. This isn't a matter of choice, Mr. Gutiérrez. It's what's being prescribed. We're not releasing your son to you. [Birds chirping] Rence : Excuse me. Do you work here? Yes. What do you need? I'm looking for sprinkler heads. Sure. I can help you with that. Great.
