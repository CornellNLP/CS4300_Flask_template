♪ Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go. ♪ I know, and she's so adorable. I mean, I love her. She is beautiful. And I gotta tell you, it is a very generous bond, Mrs. Lowenstein. Your granddaughter is a very lucky little lady. I still wonder why the Dolphins ever let you go. You should have retired here in Miami. Well, everyone else does. (laughs) Although you lost a few steps at the end. Couldn't get the edge anymore. And we picked up two stud corners by moving you to New Orleans. Yep, that's right. One of them made the Pro Bowl if I remember correctly. As an alternate. Really no big deal. Good morning, Joe. Morning, Spencer. And good morning, Mrs. Lowenstein. Good morning. I love those earrings. What are those, little dolphins? And diamonds. Dolphins and diamonds. My favorite. Thank you. So good to see you. Thank you. You smell great, by the way. What are you doing? (laughs) See you in my office right now. Yep, I'll be right there. Let me walk you out. He's very strange. He's bipolar. See Ricky Jerret's YouTube clip? Man's got a future in MMA. Yeah, I've watched that 50 times. Still makes me cringe. What about that piece of ass he was nailing in the toilet? Oh, that's Ricky. He's a hopeless romantic. (laughs) Listen... I want you to stop playing small ball. Small ball? Yeah. I didn't get you certified and show you all the angles so you can open up short change bonds for the f*cking bridge club. Our clients deserve our full attention, Spencer. Those are your words. Well, yeah, that was a year ago, Spence. I mean, Anderson didn't even want you here. It's not like we can just sit around and-- What do you mean Anderson didn't even want me here? Yeah. He calls you a football guy. I thought I told you that. No, no, you didn't tell me that. Well, I didn't want to mess with your head, you know? Way to execute on that, Joe. The point is, it took work to convince the old man that you're not just some jock in a tailored suit. This is custom-made. Tell me you love it. It's very nice. It is. But unless Frau Lowenstein put up 4,000 yards and 50 touchdowns last season, it doesn't count for sh1t. Lowenstein claims to have blown the entire '72 Dolphins front four. And that's impressive and disgusting. And also not the marquee client we covet. We gotta think a little bit bigger than that, right? Right. Think bigger. Bigger like Vernon Littlefield bigger? (sighs) Don't you dare f*cking tease me. These pants are fresh. You better get a new pair. I just signed him a few days ago. What?! (laughing) Vernon Littlefield's one of the best players in the league. Both : Mwah! Get in there. Soon to be one of the richest, too. It's a lot of wealth to manage. A lot of friends he can refer to Anderson Financial. Between Littlefield and Jarret, we are making big headway. Oh, man. Get the word out and sign even more athletes. Exactly my thought. Hey, would you mind if I took you in my mouth right now? The whole thing? The whole shebang. Make it quick. (laughs) God, man! You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this. I mean, Vernon f*cking Littlefield. Cheers, brother. Mm! Let me see the paperwork. We're working on it. You don't have it? It's not a problem. He's checking it with his guy. His-- you just said you're his guy. I am almost his guy. Listen, Vernon and I have an understanding. It's all good. You have an understanding with a 24-year-old defensive lineman, Spence. That's not something we can bank on. If we're gonna bring this to Anderson and prove to him that you belong here, he needs to see a f*cking authorization form. Now go get it. Go. And thank you for the blue balls. Why the f*ck are you yelling? Just talk to me. f*ck. No kiss good-bye? I got you a little something for your first day. What did you-- I know how much this number means to you. It means the world, baby. I mean, almost as much as you. Aw, that's sweet. Listen, this is a fresh start for us, huh? I'll never let you down again. I know you won't. Because if you do, that's the end of it. No more free passes. Do you hear me? Loud and clear. I'm f*cking serious, Ricky. So am I. No more f*cking around, okay? Babe, I promise. Good, and now you have this to remind you what an amazing and forgiving woman I am. That I do, okay? I'll cherish this. This thing must have cost you a fortune. Oh, no, baby, when it comes to our love, money is no object. And I used your Black Card to buy it. Have a great day. You did...? ♪ Don't wanna be ♪ 
♪ Cheers... ♪ Let's go, push. Pick it up. Pick it up. Come on, you got it. Push! Push! You wanna go home? You got this, baby. You wanna drop that 10 pounds? Push! Yes, push! Man : Push! Ah, yeah. Man #2 : Come on, baby. Bend it up. Drop those 10 pounds. (shouting continues) Hey, Spencey. Going someplace? Good to see you, Reg. I know you don't mean that. Any friend of Vernon's a friend of mine. Yo, man, so what can I do for you? I need to talk to Vernon for a minute. He don't want no interruptions. But I hear you've been poaching. Spencer, baby. Miss Littlefield. How you doing? Never better. You look beautiful as always. Oh, these old rags. (both laugh) Miss Littlefield, I need to bend your son's ear for a minute. He's a little caught up at the moment. I see that. He's working hard. Mm-hmm. Baby boo needs to drop a dime. Get faster off the ball. Amen. Let's meet for brunch at the Biltmore tomorrow. His day off. Just us. Biltmore? Yeah. Sounds good. Perfect. Okay. Have a great day. Thank you, baby. You, too. Thank you. See you all later. Hey, Jason get Vernon's new deal done yet? Call him yourself. He'd love to hear from you. Best hope he does. Only way you're gonna get your 300 back. It ain't about the money, Reg. I'm just trying to do what's right for Vern. Look out for his best interests. By lining your pockets up with his cash. What cash? You made damn sure he doesn't have any left. (scoffs) f*ck you, man. Hey, Reg, it doesn't have to be this way. You made damn sure it does by going behind my back. Now why don't you go on over there, man, and step the f*ck off before I make a scene? (chuckles) Looking good, Reg. Keep keeping it real. Brunch at the Biltmore? I thought you said he was broke. Well, Reggie has clearly redefined what that means. Buddy, it won't be easy driving a wedge between those two. I'll give you 300,000 reasons why it should be. I warned you not to give him that money. It was a loan. Oh, yeah? You set up a plan for him to repay that loan? Yeah, he'll square it. I told him he was a client. Fantastic. What'd he say to that? He asked me if I wanted to hang out. (laughing) Spence, you gave him a check. You know, all that does is enable him to spend even more. I know, man. But, look, if Reggie would just shut the f*ck up and get out of the way, Vernon wouldn't have this problem. You know that. And plus, he should know better. Yeah, but most guys don't. I mean, think of all the stupid sh1t you used to spend your money on. What? Oh, the 10,000-gallon aquarium I put in my house? Is that what you're talking to? That's one thing. Sharks need space. That they do. That they do. Look, you know that I hate to fly, but I'm gonna make a special trip to Dallas, sit down with Hal at OTAs and get Vernon his new contract and make sure he can pay his debts. Wow, just like that? You want to question my mojo now? I need you thinking happy, pleasant thoughts while I try to pull two misguided friends out of the poorhouse. I am nowhere near that neighborhood. The way you look, I almost believe it. You're gorgeous. You're the second guy who's hit on me today. Is it the Axe Body Spray? Tell me. I'll call you tomorrow. What, no kiss good-bye? ♪ Talkin' to the kids and the bicycle riders ♪

♪ Sock it to your whistle, now blow ♪ 
♪ Better get diploma from the hippest school, y'all... ♪ Five minutes early. You are truly born again, Ricky. Whatever it takes, Mr. Siefert. A little mix-up with the equipment manager, but we'll work that out. Good, we won't tolerate any "me first" bullshit in this outfit. It won't happen, sir. On or off the field. I hear you, sir. Good. We're glad you're here, Ricky. Alonzo : What up, Mr. Siefert? Yeah. I'm so ready. You good? What up, though, boy? You're too tall. Stop getting tall. You're growing too much. Stop it. Yes, how are you, man? Chillin'? Come on, low. We take it low. What up, though? Dude's wearing my digits. Man : And go. Man #2 : Go, go. Man : And go. ♪ Silly with your ice grilly, what the dealy, yo? ♪ 
♪ When I be on the mic, yes, I do my duty, yo ♪ 
♪ Wild up in the club... Too easy out here, Coach. It's too easy, man. Coach : Ricky. Alonzo : I need something else to do, man. Coach : Ricky, let's go. I need to go bowling or something. Coach : Focus! ♪ X that, look at shorty, she's a little cutie, yo ♪

(groans) We've got to get you a bus like mine. Madden turned me on to it. Nah, it's too slow. I'd rather suffer at 35,000 feet. Everything good with Vern? Never better. He had a pretty good season. He had a great season. That's why I want to talk about extending. Now you're gonna drag my ass into the goddamn office. Come on, we both know the office is wherever we are. Except the shitter. I never do business on the can. Yeah, I feel more comfortable knowing that. Thank you for sharing. Chelsea, bring a couple more. He's still got a year left. You want him to stay, right? What do you think? I think an early reward shows a lot of love. He's only owed two million for this coming season. A crisp new contract with a hefty guarantee, that takes free agency out of the picture, right? He's allowed to play freely. No distractions. No awkward questions from the press. It's a win-win. Jason, look, you know I love Vernon. He's a beast. He's a decent player. Come on, Hal, he's the best DT in the league. Well, all right, let's not... Look, I know you don't have to do this, Hal, but trust me, you want to, all right? Vernon's got a big whisper crew. They're good people, just bad ideas. We get the deal done now, he goes to camp, he's happy, he's secure feeling that Dallas Cowboy love. We don't get it done, you could find yourself negotiating with somebody else next spring. I doubt he's gonna be the kind of guy you want to tip beers with, you know what I mean? I hate you. 
 
 (phone ringing) Hello? Mr. Strasmore, it's Karen Rossi from Citibank. Karen, right. I've been meaning to get back to you. Just a courtesy call. Your primary account is overdrawn, so I thought you might want to transfer some funds from your other account. I have another account? You do. How much is in it? Um, $3,052. Well, we may as well move it all over, Karen. I'll get right on it. Thank you. No, thank you. Oh, Karen, by the way-- just a shot in the dark here. By chance, do I have a third account? Hey! Hey, hands off, fellas. This one a stick? You asked me that yesterday. Come on, I just want to take a test drive. How about you get a driver's license first and then a job? I knew you'd be back. Trying to squeeze in one last fishing trip before training camp. This 1500 should do the trick. Yeah, that 1500 is solid. If you're going for small game. But a big game fisherman like yourself needs a big game truck. The 3500HD 2015 edition. 6.6 liter V8 turbo-diesel six-speed tranny. Boy, this bad boy got swagger. Well, you got the sales rap down. It ain't a rap if it's true. Don't try to tell me you gave up two good years on the field so you could pack on an extra 30 and hustle trucks. You retired too soon, Charles. (scoffs) What, you disagree? At the risk of blowing this sale, yes, sir, I do. Big bodies aren't hard to come by. Easy enough to get back in shape, even for you. But a mind like yours on the O line, now that's a rare thing. A faster game requires quick thinking. I don't know. Civilian life suits me just fine, you know? No more pit piles and head slaps for me. I'ma just kick back, soak up the AC, read something other than a playbook. Start a family. You know, be a dad. Okay, you sold me. On retirement? Not a chance. On the 3500. (laughs) Let's do some paperwork. (whistle blowing) Ah, thanks. Hey, I love your YouTube clip. Oh, yeah? Thank you. Which one? The one that got you sent here. Divine intervention, my friend. Chip, refreshments and a towel. Oh, yeah. Good looking, baby. Appreciate it. Hands look good out there, 'Zo. Finding your wind? Look, man, I know what it is, all right? But you don't need to look over your shoulder. We're teammates now and winning is all that matters. You been wearing that number a while? The f*ck you care, man? Just wondering if you're attached to it. But what is it to you? Look, I know I'm the new guy in town. I get that. But I've been wearing 18 since day one. It ain't day one for you no more, is it? No, it isn't. Hmm. How much you want for it? What I want for what? Number 18, it got sentimental value to me. Oh, sh1t. Sentimental. That's cute. 40 large. Hear me out. $40,000 in cash for a pair of digits you don't even care about. Hear me out. No sale. How about this? Lucky charm from my girl. All right? At least another 20,000. What the hell I want that for if I got to change my number? You could sell this, man. Or better yet-- better yet, you could take the number 81. Flip the digits. My jeweler is accommodating, all right? He's got mad skills. And he gonna need them skills. No sale, new guy. Cute chain, though. Man : f*ckin' hood ornament. He like that with everyone? Just you.

Does that light a fire in your belly or what? It does. Easy on the sauce, Joe. Hmm? Last time we had a meeting outside the office, you downed a whole bottle of Pinot and hit on a client's wife. She was begging for it. Well, she was 72 years old. Well, I don't discriminate because that would be ageism. Ahem, let's go talk some sense to Vern and get that signature, huh? Let's do it. Mr. Strasmore, your group's on the patio. I'll show you the way. Okay. Group? (music playing) Wow. Yo, what up, Spence? What's up, Vernon? Hey, come on, man. I saved you a seat. Hey, who's your friend? This is my boss Joe. Joe Krutel. Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Littlefield. Vern, big fan. Mama : Pull up a chair, Joseph. The more the merrier. Joe : All right. Spencer, you have your seat. Hey, hey, hey, can somebody pour my man some Cristal? It's Eugene's birthday. (cheering) You missing Green Bay yet, Rick? I miss the Lambeau Leap, but they can keep their cold weather. Yeah. What happened to you and Spence? I thought y'all two clicked. Yeah, you're a good judge of relationships. Tell me, Bella slapped that chastity belt on you yet? Oh, all right, watch it. Low blow. Okay, you love it. You ready? Always. What's my hair doing? You don't want to know. This is Tracy LeGette reporting from day one of OTAs with Miami's new slot receiver, Ricky Jarret. Now, tell us, how did things feel out there for you today, Ricky? Oh, they felt fantastic. You know, it's great to be on the field, you know, and meet my new teammates, get the much needed reps in. Mmm. And I'm truly, truly touched that God, Jesus, Mr. Ross, and the entire Miami organization have bestowed upon me this opportunity. I thank them with all my heart. Wow, watch out, Antonio Brown. - (music playing) (chatter) No one's even touched that trout. Hey, Vernon. Eventually we gonna talk a little business, brother. Hey, let's crank this music up, muchacho. Come on, baby. You gotta give something Eugene can dance to. Yeah. Okay. - (band playing) (crowd cheering) (Vernon laughs) Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Yeah? Did you just say you're in five fantasy leagues? That's right. I can barely keep up with two. I know. Man : That's hard. He used to be in six. Yeah, I got tossed from one. Why don't you tell everybody why you got tossed? Vernon : Yeah. Come on, Joe. Come on. I don't think that's relevant. Oh, you're being coy. He's being coy. No, tell everybody why. I made an unsportsmanlike post to my nemesis. What was the comment? You posted it, right? I don't want to offend Mama by repeating it. Oh, don't put me in this. Okay, all right. Okay, okay. Let's just say that if I had known Jumbotron was my brother's 14-year-old daughter, I would not have called her that. (laughing) It was c**t. (phone ringing) Mama : To Jumbotron! Man : To Jumbotron! (cheering) What's up, Jay? Yeah. Hold on one second. That's Jason? Good. What happened to your mojo, big man? What do you want me to say? Dallas had some trouble this off season But don't worry, I'm gonna loosen them up. It's just gonna take a little bit more time. You are killing me. The clock is ticking. Plus I'm about to throw Reggie face-first through a f*cking wall. Jason : Check that temper, Strasmore. The only person you're gonna be hurting is yourself. Send Reggie my love. Yeah, he wouldn't know what to do with it. TV announcer : Four games to love and... another drop shot. (door opens) Julie : I'm home. Hey. Hey, in here. In the living room. Hey, baby. What you doing? Oh, hey, just brushing up on the new playbook. Look at you. Moved a top-of-the-line truck today. Baby, that is great. Congratulations. All in a day's work at Tropical Chevrolet. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm good. You gonna lie to Mama like that? What's wrong? Hey, you think I'm too heavy? No, Charles. I think you're burly. Robust. Fancy-ass words for fat. Baby, I think you're perfect. You know I love that sexy body. Oh, you do, do you? - Mm-hmm. You love that body? I love all that body. Okay.

It's between me and Vernon. Yo, wait, between you and Vernon? Hey, listen, man, this sh1t ain't cool, man. Reggie, calm down. Yo, what this little worm-faced f*ck say to you? I didn't say anything. Reginald, mind your words. All I'm saying, man, is you gonna let him  do us like this after all we've been through? It's cool, man. Look, we're just talking. I'm gonna get the car. I'm gonna see you all back at the crib. You're picking up the check, worm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, my pleasure. Vernon, it's not personal. Spence, I leave it all on the field every time I strap in. And Dallas knows that. Things like this take time. Look, I got bills stacked up and mad overhead. I need a new contract now. Jason is handling that. I promise you. But in the meantime, you can't keep letting your crew spill what's left of your cash all over town. What am I supposed to do? Get it under control. Hey, I know they're your boys, but when you left Crenshaw, this was the exact thing you were looking to escape-- trouble, distractions. You got drafted, got paid, and then you flew them all the f*ck out here. (sighs) Man, I would never turn my back, Spence. Vernon, they are bleeding you dry. When I signed my first contract, I was the pride of Bethlehem. The very next day, half of Pennsylvania had their hands out and anybody who did anything nice for me expected that they were gonna get a piece of what I got. What I earned. And you know what I did? I hooked up every last one of them until I was damn near broke. There are never enough pieces to go around, okay? And no matter how much you give them, they're always gonna want more. You want to take care of people who are closest to you? Then take care of you first. That's what I'm gonna help you do. Man, Spence, you already have. You're like a big brother to me, man. Vernon, I'm not your big brother. I'm your financial manager and I will put your money to work. And I promise you this, your family and your friends will have everything you want them to have... within reason and on a budget. What about Reggie? We're gonna find a place for Reggie. I hear Tahiti's very nice. Come on, Spence. That's not funny, man. I'm kidding. Let me show you something. This is an authorization form. This allows Anderson Financial access to your assets and your investments. Sign it or you keep rolling the dice. But what I won't do, I won't stand around and watch you make the same mistakes I made. (sighs) Vernon : It's just business, right? With Dallas it's business. With me it's much more. Hey, look, man, I'll sign, but Reg, man, he got my back. And he got a say in every move we make. That's cool with you, Reg? Cool. So how about it, Spence? Just business? Okay. Hey, you got a pen? sh1t. Hey, kid, you got a pen? Oh, of course. All right. Keep it. Thanks, man. All right, Spence. Let me get your back real quick, Reg. All right, man. Family. Thank you, man. All right, thank you. I'll call you later. All right. Come on, Reg, let's go. You got the new McLaren? Looks hot, right? Hey, don't sweat it too hard, Spencer. We leased it. (laughs) He ain't never seen nothing like this. Look at that. Bam. (laughs) (engine roars) (tires squeal) Vernon got the new McLaren? Yep. (laughs) I never doubted you for a second. Thanks for the assist in there. Yeah. Everything good? Well, corporate's gonna sh1t when they see the bill. Eh, f*ck 'em. We got bigger plans. Great work. Thank you. Let's keep it rolling. All right. Time for an upgrade, Joe. What do you mean? This is good enough for Peyton Manning, right? That's a commercial. ♪ We're gonna make it, baby...♪ He drives a Mercedes. (sighs)
