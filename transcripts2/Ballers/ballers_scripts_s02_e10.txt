(EXHALES) Thank you. You know, I could give you my tailor's number. He can redo your whole closet. Anderson : Can he design me a new ass? 'Cause this one is definitely past its prime. (SIGHS) $11 million to go along with the one million I gave you in cash. Now let's go on and make that deal. Have a seat. (DOOR CLOSES) I've given this a lot of thought and I've changed my mind. About what? The sale. I no longer want to part ways with ASM. Are you f*cking with me right now? Now, just hear me out. We had a deal. No, we had an understanding. It's f*cking bullshit. I thought you were a man of your word. I never gave you my word. Give me back my million in cash. Just settle down. And I'm gonna open up my own f*cking shop and bury you next to f*cking Andre 'cause you both f*cking deserve each other. Okay, you feel better you got a little venom out of your system? I love your passion, I really do,  but I'm not gonna let you make that deal. Why? Because you can't afford it on so many levels. So, here's how it's gonna go down. You're gonna figure out a way to get that registration, you're gonna come back here, and I'm gonna let you purchase a piece of ASM. And then you won't be so financially stretched,  you can actually do your job. How's that? (EXHALES) 50/50 proposition. Absolutely. 60/40. 50/50 proposition. 51/49. Do I have your word on this? Well, we both know my word ain't worth sh1t. God damn. Yes, yes, of course you've got my word on it. You can have a whole paragraph. And I'm sorry about firing you. It's just that sometimes you have to act harshly to create a teachable moment. Next time, you could do it the Obama way. Just have me over for a beer. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Thank you. All right. What's happening? Don't do that. Come on, get in here. Go, go, go. Get that registration. And do me a favor, try not to kill anyone in the process, especially yourself. Oh, can't make you any promises, though. Do the best you can, will ya? All right. (MUSIC PLAYING) You don't scrub it like that, man. You gotta use a circular motion. How about you f*cking do it, then, Dennis? Why are we doing this sh1t in the first place, man? To remember what it's like to feel an ounce of satisfaction. There you go. Jason :  Draft and develop is a noble idea,  but Aaron and Jordy, they need help now and it's not like your draft did them any favors, so give me a call back, shithead. Thanks. I left word with Carolina, the Packers, and New England. They must be creaming in their jeans to sign our boy. Christmas come early in the form of Ricky Jerret. Merry Christmas. Who wants me more? They all said that they will get back to us. What the f*ck does that mean? I'm putting myself out there for pennies on the damn dollar. Belichick was intrigued. What did he say? Five words. Which were? I'll get back to you. You told them I'll work on a one-year deal? I told them that you were only interested in Super Bowl LI. If that number pops up on your phone, you drop whatever it is you're doing and you take the call. Great, now I'm just down to hoping a GM drunk dials me. Hey, man, a booty call from Belichick is a badass thing. A booty call is a booty call. A booty call is a booty call. ♪ So I shot him in the ass on the downstroke ♪ 
♪ Yeah, I shot him in the ass on the downstroke... ♪ I can't see sh1t. Let me drive. Nah, I got the wheel, Reg. You get the tunes. Yo, you sure you wanna expose yourself to the team so early? It ain't too late. We could turn back. Gotta be there before the competition shows up. Vern, they know when you're healthy, you're the best DT on the team, if not in the league. I'm healthy enough. Wait till OTAs. You'll be farther along. Impress the sh1t out of them. I'm going now. Plant my flag. They can judge all they want. Are you in or not? Yo, man, I ain't dig up our mixtapes from middle school for my health, man. Come on, man! What you got in there, Reg? It's gotta be something good. Boom. Boom. ♪ Hey, yo, Queen's get the money, long time no cash ♪ 
♪ I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast ♪ 
♪ The fool retaliated, so I had to think fast ♪ 
♪ Pull out my heat first... ♪ Man :  Been a while, Spence. Looks like you've been taking good care. Yeah, I've been of sound mind and body, Michael. Spiritually, I've been f*cked, though. Okay, so where do you need it this time? Shoulder again? No, let me show you. (CLEARS THROAT) Holy f*ck, man. That looks really bad. Don't worry. You sure you want me to put a needle in that? I took an oath, Spence. Listen, it's okay. I've been getting all my treatment done at the med center and, uh, just had a lot on my plate lately. The f*cking Vikes ain't doing anything, Michael. So I'd just appreciate it... just give me a quick poke and I'll get back out there. All right. (PHONE CHIMING) You know what? I've been expecting that. Well, take it. Yeah? Okay, good. I'll be right back. Clyde "The Glide." What's good? Up to my nuts in rookies at the symposium. I swear, these M*therf*ckers get bigger and dumber every year. Yeah, I appreciate you getting back to me. I was sorry to hear they bounced your registration, Spence. Lawyers got spooked about the loss. And you lying about it didn't help your cause. Yeah, listen, I wanna get a couple of minutes with D. Smith, okay? Plead my case in person. Yeah, well, the head of the union doesn't have time for appeals  and I doubt you could change his mind. At least give me a chance. Well, there's nothing I can do. I could've said the exact same thing when you got caught getting blown by a f*cking stripper in the back of your car, but I came through for you, right? Don't even go there. A grievance was filed. What are you talking about? Like you don't know. Andre filed  a grievance against me? Who the f*ck is Andre? Hey, stop playing these mind games with me. I ain't saying sh1t else. Clyde, you gotta tell me. That would be a violation of union rules  and a total breach of privacy. You know what, a total breach of privacy would be me texting your boss the pictures of when you were passed out with a f*cking pink thong on. It was Eddie George, okay? Eddie? We found his name  in your financial file. We looked him up. He told us the whole story, Spence. It wasn't pretty. Where can I find him? Spencer, I can't tell you that. Clyde, listen, please. If our friendship means anything to you, you will do me this solid, please. He's here, okay? At the symposium. You're serious? (GROANS) D. Felt bad about how f*cked up Ed got  and offered him a gig greeting the rookies. All right. Clyde, listen, I appreciate you, okay? You didn't hear it from me. Now delete those pictures, you dirty m*therf*cker. (LINE RINGING) Joe's voice :  You got Joe. Leave a message. Hey, Joe. It's Spencer. I'm going to the rookie symposium in Canton. I'll see you when I get back. Wish me luck. (DOOR CLOSES) All right, Spence. Let's do this. All right. I'm good to go. You ready? Oh, yeah. Here we go. ♪ Yeah, yeah... ♪ Ready! Set! (BLOWS WHISTLE) Bring those elbows in. Tighten your elbows. Yes! Yes! Huh? Yes! Did you get much time in as a rook? No. I mean, I sat behind Roman Oben. He had 12 years in the league. And you can, too, if you keep this up. Now run it back. Let's go. Again. Yes, sir. Line up! Remember,  heels in, toes out,  feet shoulder width apart, eyes on the target. Yes, sir! Set. (BLOWS WHISTLE) Go! Tighten your elbows,  tighten your elbows! Low! Stay low! You got a real gem, I'll tell ya. And he's a good kid, too. Yeah. Yeah, he's gonna need some help with some NFL pass rush moves, but you'll get him all coached up on that. Anthony, hit the showers and then meet me in the film room. Yes, sir. (PHONE RINGING) All right. What's up, baby? Hey, baby. I got your note. It was very sweet. I've been missing my girls. We miss you, too. Look, I'ma bounce out of here early tonight, cook y'all dinner. Lasagna? That is my specialty. All right. Love you, baby. I love you, too, babe. (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ 2-17 on the chair, man ♪

I don't need Virginia, okay? I've had access to your schedule since the day you started at Anderson. Ah. You ready for this? One last shot at registration, huh? Do or die. Come on. Yep. I mean, either way, I'm not letting you go at this alone. I appreciate that, brother. So, we have an appointment with D. Smith? Not exactly. Nah. It's crazy how big Texas is. You straight, man? You look tired. We should just pull over for the night and find a B&B. Nah, everybody know B&Bs is haunted. (LITTLE PLUG WHIMPERS) I'll take the wheel at the next pee break so you could sleep. I want you looking fresh when Dallas lays eyes on you. Hey, I've been thinking. I'm putting you on payroll. What? For real. You deserve it. Nah, that... that salary sh1t just f*cked things up between us. I'm happy just grinding pro bono. I just wanna be a good friend. But for 3K a week you can be an even better friend.

♪ So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence... ♪ Joe :  Uh, don't do drugs. Thank you. I hope your wife is feeling better and your kid gets out of jail. Thank you. Jim, well, good luck to you and the whole fam. Oh, hey, we should check out the Hall of Fame tomorrow. I've always wanted to see the bust room. You know that room is filled with bronze heads, right, not bronze tits? (LAUGHS) It would be crazy if it was both, huh? You all right? Yeah, I just haven't seen Ed in 10 years. Hey, you're doing the right thing here. Okay? You'll turn him around. Gentlemen, welcome to the Bertram Inn, a destination like no other. I'll say. I have a reservation under Krutel. Ah, yes. You got our last room. Now, I see it's a queen. Would you guys like a cot brought in? Both : Yes. There you go. All right, you're in room 253. Enjoy your stay, gentlemen. Uh, one more thing. Could you tell me what room Eddie George is in, please? I played with him. I just wanna go say hey. Room 308. (ELEVATOR DINGS) (DOOR OPENS) Strasmore? Hey, Ed. What the hell are you doing in Ohio? Well, I thought maybe we could talk. My number hasn't changed, but maybe you lost that, too. Ed, it'll only take a minute, please. Maybe some other time, Spence. Ah! God damn it, the door's on my foot! Take it out, then. You gotta let go of it first! f*ck that, man! (GRUNTING) God damn it! f*ck! Are you f*cking nuts? 
 
 Hey, listen. I know you filed a grievance against me. You're lucky I didn't file a f*cking lawsuit. I nearly lost it when I heard that you of all people are trying to be a financial advisor. Do you even have an MBA? It's not like that at this place. Oh, really? These guys are bringing me along and they're showing me the ropes. 'Cause I was told these fools made you the boss. So tell me, how does passing an accounting exam qualify you to handle these boys' money? Because I wanna look out for them. Really? Yes. I wanna be an astronaut. Does that qualify me to walk on the moon? I didn't try to lose your money. Mm. I f*cking lost everything, too. Did you live out your f*cking car? No, but I still... Did you live out your car for a year, Spence? Work in a coffee shop? Did you think of throwing yourself off the side of a bridge? 'Cause I've been up on a few. And I'm so grateful that I didn't jump because now I have the chance to say f*ck you, Spencer. You have no right managing anybody's money. Get the f*ck out. (DOOR OPENS) Uh-oh. That doesn't look like a "we're going to Disney World" face. It's over, man. Eddie's never gonna withdraw the grievance and I'm never gonna get registered. My f*cking career is over for the second time in three years. (SIGHS) Hey. You gave it your best shot. I got no f*cking clue what to do next. Oh, you wanna know what to do next? I'll tell you what to do next. (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Bend over, make your knees touch your elbows... ♪ Ha! Hey! Yeah! f*ck it! f*ck it! ♪ Bend over, make your knees touch your elbows... ♪ Whoo!

I didn't need to know that. (DENNIS LAUGHS) Hey, one of these teams is gonna step up, son. Just gotta keep your mind on the big picture. I had a $36 million picture before you planted that Hall of Fame sh1t in my head. Oh, I still can't believe you turned down spending half the year in LA with the hottest bitches on Earth all while playing at the Coliseum. Man, the only reason you wanna go to LA is 'cause you think you gonna be the next Spike Lee. Keep smoking that reefer, you pinhead. Nigga, the only reason you want him in Canton  is so people might remember your old ass played, too. It's better than listening to you, you homeless-looking m*therf*cker. I'm his best friend, you fat f*ck! I'm his father, you fool! You better back the f*ck up. Get that thing out my face! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dennis... (PHONE CHIMING) (ELEVATOR DINGS) f*cking phone is gone. You dropped it in the urinal last night. How the f*ck did that happen? Uh, you said "f*ck this phone" and then you dropped it in the urinal, and then you took a piss on it. It was a pretty powerful gesture. One of many I'm sure we'll regret in the years to come. Ah, regret's for pussies. Yeah. Might wanna second-guess that nipple ring, though. What? Oh, f*ck me. How did that happen? Doesn't f*cking matter. The only thing that matters is we're going out the way we came in with a big f*cking bang. Unfortunately, that f*cking bang keeps exploding in my head over and over and over again. Let's get the f*ck out of here before I puke all over this lobby. f*ck me. Checking out so soon? We sure are, Julian. Did you enjoy your stay? Oh, yeah. Good. Ahem, I'm gonna go get a bottle of water. Be right back. Now, did you purchase anything from the minibar? All of it. Mm. Man :  Congrats. Man #2 :  Yeah, yeah. Man :  This obviously helps your game in football and everything else,  so you just continue on and so forth, right? Well, good seeing you guys, man. Yeah. Eddie, hey. Uh, do you mind if we have a word? Go in, guys. Uh, you a new rookie? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's me. Joe Krutel, all-American left tackle at Alabama. Roll Tide! Roll Tide! How can I help you, man? Well, not me, actually. It's my friend. Real or imaginary? Real. Yeah. Ah. I got a real friend. Um, it's Spencer. I'm the guy that hired him at ASM. So, you're the m*therf*cker that got him to this point. I'm that m*therf*cker. Mm. But Spencer and I finally got our sh1t together. Edward! What's up, Jay? What's up, bawg? Joe! How's that nipple ring feeling today? Ah! You f*ck! (SIGHS) Okay, we're in the process of getting our sh1t together. But I really wanted you to know that Spencer's not the same guy he was when he walked into my office. You used him to get access to the players. Yeah, of course I did. At first. But then it turned into something different, something pure. Hmm. I watched him work his way up from a cubicle to a corner office. He had the whole staff believing in something besides numbers for once. And most importantly... most importantly, that's a guy who's learned from his mistakes. I'm glad to hear that he's learned from his mistakes, but every man needs to be held accountable for his actions. Then hold him accountable. Anthony's got outstanding foot quickness, good balance and technique. Yeah, he's a little undersized and needs to improve as a drive blocker, but I think he's a natural. Definitely ain't scared to put in the hard work. Same thing could be said for you. I've seen you in the building at 5:00 AM all week. How you know that? I'm here at 4:30. And if you start coming at 4:30, I'll come at 4:15. (CHUCKLES) You know, I've been doing research on edge rushers. If a guy can't run a 10-yard dash in 1.6 seconds or less,  his chances of becoming an effective pass rusher in this league drops severely. Meanwhile, maybe two players run that split the entire draft. Thank you. And the coaching staff is up my ass to pick linebackers. Anthony could become an All-Pro and the coaches will bitch that we didn't find twof ho. Another losing season has only dialed up the dysfunction around here. I need someone I can trust. I wanna promote you, Charles. Make you my number two. First order of business will be to get you out on the road. Scarlet and Gray game at Ohio State. I've never been to the Horseshoe. From there, you hit all the big-time programs. Get an early look at the 2017 draft class. You know, you could tell as much about a player's character in a May scrimmage as you can from playing in a Bowl game. You'll be on the road for the next couple of months. That's gonna be all right? Yes, sir. No problem at all. Good. Jay :  It's not your right to play in this league, it's your privilege. I'll tell you right now, there's a ton of guys out there It's actually not hard to succeed in this league, guys. All you gotta really do... don't screw up off the field and outwork everybody else on it. I talked about privilege earlier. It's my privilege right now to bring somebody on  who wasn't scheduled to speak, but wants a couple minutes of your time. Listen to what this man has to say. He's been around the block. Everybody, Spencer Strasmore. (APPLAUSE) (MICROPHONE FEEDBACK RINGS) Hello, rookies. Some of you out there may know me,  some of you have seen me play,  and I'm sure just as many of you have no idea who the f*ck I even am. (LAUGHTER) That's okay, 'cause most days I wake up and I got no f*cking clue either. (LAUGHTER) I guess I should've retired when the Dolphins traded me to New Orleans. But, you know, this is a cruel game we play. You get so hooked on it, they gotta put you in a straitjacket and drag your ass off the field because when you're playing, as you guys know, you're all king sh1t. Right? You're the masters of the universe. Young, tough, good-looking, rich, getting all kinds of pussy. (CHEERING) Man :  Whoo! Yeah, you think you're indestructible. You feel like you can do anything you set your mind to. Well, a lot of... a lot of you are gonna soon find out that you can't. You see that man right there? That's Eddie George, Heisman Trophy winner, Rookie of the Year, four-time Pro Bowler,  over 10,000 yards rushing,  and at one time my very close friend. I thought I could make him a rich man and I convinced him to go in on a real estate deal... and give me his money. Not just a little bit. All of it. And I lost it. I lost every f*cking cent. And I lost a friend. But the truth is I don't even deserve to be that man's friend. I don't even deserve to be up here talking to any of you. I deserve exactly what I got...  nothing. And if some of you assholes out there don't smarten up, that's exactly what you're gonna wind up with. And it won't be some shark  in a $5,000 suit who takes you. It's gonna be your brother, your sister, your parents, it's gonna be your friend. It's gonna be someone like me  who everyone says, "He's a good guy" when beneath it all is a selfish, dishonest, untrustworthy... piece of sh1t. I'm sorry, Ed. I should've never done what I did to you. You don't need to forgive me. You just need to know that I'm sorry. f*cking be smart. Yeah, f*ck, yeah, that's some truth right there! I can respect that. Y'all respect that? I respect that. Yeah! Work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work, whoa! Watch that Achilles. We're not doing foot work yet. All right, let's go. You'll get there. Come on. Work, work, work, work, work. Owner :  Vernon! I'd like you to meet Dexter Baines, your new teammate. He came in early to work out, too. That's the kind of fire I like to see from my men. Got here after me, but it's cool. Let Dex step in. All right. Okay, go! Work! Down grab, up grab! (BOTH GRUNTING) Work, work. Up the line. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, boys, easy. Good job. Okay, go! Work, work, work. Work. There you go! So, what is this? What's good? You want access to the kingdom, right? First, you gotta get past the guards. (RICKY CHUCKLES) What's up, Ricky? Glad you could make it. Yeah, y'all had me worried. Worried, man? Yeah. sh1t, man, I was buried on the depth chart for years. Your boy gets a call in the middle of the night. Brady says, "Foxboro, 30 minutes." Roll up, he's in the bubble training in March. No sh1t? That's how we roll, man. Why don't you line up at the X? I'ma hit the slot. What you mean? Like... what? Let's go get some. Right now? Right now. We brought gloves. We're prepared for everything, man. Yeah, but I ain't got... Welcome to New England, boss. Let's go. Get to work. Let's go, let's go.
