I got tired of my eggs getting cold while I signed autographs. Oh, my God. I know what you mean. That's so annoying, right? (laughs) Joe, why don't you share the good news with the boys? Yeah? All right. I worked a little magic with Maximo and got him down to 150 grand. Spencer : The man has delivered. 500 to 150? That's... damn, worm. Jason :  It's a good deal, Vernon. Ah, there you are, J. We thought we lost you. I'm everywhere I need to be at all times. Including the golf course. Listen, I got a family emergency that couldn't be helped. But I'm telling you to give her the money. It's a no-brainer. Hey, listen, Vern, look. We don't like this either, okay? But the pictures she has can hurt you. And all things considered, $150,000 is a f*cking fire sale. It's a gift from God. And Joe Krutel. (sighs) But I'm the one giving my hard-earned cash away. This sh1t ain't right. You just got your roster bonus in. Let's pretend it never happened. I was gonna use that to square things with you. You can pay him back when Jason closes your contract extension. Jason :  Buddy, it's only days away if you pay. But if I pay her, where the f*ck does it end? Tell you what. I'll pay her. Huh? Wha... what? You pay me what you owe me out of your roster bonus and I'll take it from there. That works for me. I'm sure it does, Reg. (sighs) Vernon, come here. Let me talk to you a second. Come on. All right, look, here's the deal. It was our party. I invited you. I let things get out of control. Okay? I'm gonna pay Maximo the money, I'm gonna get back our photo files, and then it's done. No hard feelings, no debt owed. You sure about this, Spence? 1,000% sure. If they had Snapchat and Instagram back when I was your age, sh1t, I would have been put on a lifetime ban. (both laugh) I had to start paying attention. That's the thing I want from you, Vern. From now on, I want you to start paying attention. Here, look at me. Look at me. So let's learn from this, let's be smart, let's move on, the both of us. Hey, man, you keep preaching, I'll keep learning. Come on. Thanks, man. You got it. Hey, so you going to see Maximo now? No, I'm gonna drop by Tina's. I gotta take care of some Roddney business first. Okay. How is Rod? He's still dead, man. Oh, sh1t. My bad. Take it easy, Spencey. That's big of you, man, picking up the kid's tab, but 150K is a lot of money. Let me split it with you, all right? No. No, no, no. 50-50. Come on. No, no. Thank you, though. I know Angie. I'll take care of it. You get the next one. Assuming there is a next one. Oh, you bet your ass there will be. (groans) No doubt about it. God damn, you got the i8. Yeah, is this enough of an upgrade for you or what? (laughs) All right, so I'll  Max, set up the meeting, meet you there after Tae Bo. Oh, listen to this thing purr, all right? Hold on. You got to put your foot on the brake... I know, I know. Wow, I don't know why I said it. (car chiming) Still getting a feel for it, that's all. Have fun at Tae Bo. (music playing) Don't do it. Don't do it. Just be cool. You... you f*cked up. You f*cked up and now you gotta give her her space. She'll be divine and forgive. You just gotta be cool. Just gotta be cool. sh1t. (rings) Hi, this is Annabella Ruiz. Be nice. Be nice. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. [i] (beeps) You must be crazy leaving me. Word? You gonna leave Ricky Jarret? You must be f*cking insane! f*cking insane! (phone clatters) (exhales) Why'd I do that? Why'd I do that? All right, so what you want to do... you want to broil this at about 450 degrees...  Okay. ... so the top stays nice and crunchy, the inside stays nice and moist. Now, that right there, Tina, is Grandma's recipe. You're gonna love it. Mm, nice to see you wearing your chef's hat again. Well, it's therapeutic. Where's Junior at? Is he around? Football practice. This early in the summer? Yeah, had him playing 7-on-7 over at Central High. Same place Rod set all those state records, but for Junior, it's AAU. Pretty much a year-round thing now. Do you have any concern about him playing? No, I grill the coaches out proper techniques so he knows how to protect himself. Stays out every night till the lights go out. Still the best way for him to connect with his father, you know? Yeah. Far better than this. Wow. Roddney always knew how to make an entrance. (chuckles) What are you gonna do with him? I just did it. No. No, no no. Roddney needs to be at home with you and RJ. The gardener spent more time here than Roddney did. Road trips, charity events, camps. Other extracurricular activities. Spencer, please. You'll figure out what to do with him. No, no. I don't even know what to do with myself. If anyone can find a final resting place for him, it's you. Where do I start? I don't know where to start with this. It's not about where you start, it's where you finish. There you are. I was getting worried. Was the traffic bad? No, but I did consider driving off the bridge a couple times on the way down here. You look skinny. I'm too busy to eat, Ma. Come on, where's this guy. He's in the kitchen. Juicing. PEDs? No. Kale, lemon, ginger, cayenne pepper. It tastes like ass, but it's supposed to be good for you. Now, I want you to be nice to David. He's been very kind and it's been a while since your father left me. He didn't leave you, Ma. He died. I don't know where this is going, but David wants to get serious. Like how serious? Well, exclusive. No more s*x outside the relationship. (sighs) I'm gonna throw up. Don't. Listen to me. I want your opinion before fully committing. I love you, Ma. All right? So if you're happy, I'm happy. (chuckles) Good. Now let's meet David. Okay. David. Yeah? (knife chopping) Look who's here. Oh, hey, dude. You must be Jason. Oh, sh1t. You must be young. It's great the way Ricky opened up the way he did. And on national TV. sh1t, shocked the hell out of me. Talking about his dad like that took some balls. Textbook Ricky. Digs himself a hole and then he charms his way out of it. Well, I sure hate to throw that brother a shovel, but he is out of control, Bella. All right? That's what I came here to tell you. Do you want me to pretend to be shocked? You know, so you don't feel like you wasted your time? (laughs) He's got another house. He calls it the Funhouse. I had to pull Charles's big behind out of there the other day. Girl, he was high as a giraffe's ass. They have a s*x room and a love pond, a whole bunch of nasty skanks roaming the halls. Just disgusting. I kicked one of his housemates in the dick if that makes you feel any better. You knew about this Funhouse? I heard about it a couple times. The girls, they talk about it. They don't talk to me. Nobody wanted to embarrass you. And what do you think I am right now? I would say embarrassed, ashamed, furious, mortified... Over it. I'm just over it. Can we go get a real drink? Hell, yeah, we can go get a real drink, girl. We can get a whole bunch of real drinks. Girl, you deserve it. Charles : So what don't you understand? All of it. Now, what's that "gun trips right" "Z short 75 max combo fade" sh1t? What the f*ck am I running? Ah. This route's easy, Rick. You're on the front side. The combo speaks of the strength of the formation. You run a quick out and the fade is for the X on the back side. See? You see what I'm talking about? Now, you might as well be speaking Swahili right now. You need to sit still for a few minutes and focus. sh1t, I am focused, man. That sh1t's f*cked. The system's f*cked. This ain't got nothing to do with the system. This is all about Annabella, ain't it? Yeah, your girl left you again, and this time it's driving you crazy because you know you really messed things up. No, I'm not thinking about what's-her-name at all. Oh, no? No. Well, why you been banging out on the leg press for 20 minutes straight, then? Somebody going at it that hard might be trying to blow off some steam. Some steam created by his girl leaving him. You know what? Fine, all right? You're right. You happy? Man, I hate this sh1t, man. What the f*ck she leave me for? She reached her breaking point. That surprises you? Hell, yeah. How was I supposed to see that coming? You weren't. You were supposed to be better to her so it never came. I just want her to call me back, man. Is that so much to ask for? Let me ask you something. Do you love Annabella or do you just hate being alone? I don't know. What's the difference? I'll ask you another way. Do you want her or do you need her? I need her. Well, I mean, I want her. I don't know man, I want her and need her. What the f*ck are you throwing these trick questions at me for? All right, listen. Quit calling. Go see your girl. 
 
 (music playing) Thanks for coming. I feel boxed in at the office. Prefer to do business in the field. Something we have in common. Bang that waitress from the track yet or what? Not yet, but she makes a hell of an intern. (laughs) Don't mind if I do. No, I'm good. Maximo, listen, man. I'm glad we can finally agree on a price. And I hope your other buyers weren't too devastated. Nah. Is there a problem? A slight change of plans. Maximo, we had a agreement, okay? 150,000. We shook hands. It's not my call. Miss Lee wants a cherry on top. Does she also want a pint of Vernon's blood? How about his firstborn child? Would she like that? She simply wants a sit-down. No. No, we're not gonna do that. We're not gonna put Vernon in that situation. No sit-down. It's not Vernon she wants to sit down with. It's you, Spencer. She wants to see your face when you hand her the check. Maybe catch up on old times. He'll do it. No, I won't do it. No, he will not do it. No, I'm not gonna f*cking do it. It was $150,000, no sit-down. What's next? She has more pictures? She wants more money? It's 150, a sit-down, or there's no deal. There's no f*cking sit-down. You call us all the way down here when you knew the f*cking deal wasn't square? There is no f*cking sit-down. Here's her goddamn check. She cashes it when I get my pictures. Good luck f*cking your intern. You need all the luck you can get. Look at that. Got an autograph after all. Sell it. Buy better cigars. (sighs) Dick. (music playing on radio) ♪ Born in the projects, then to the field ♪

Not here. Well, where she at? I don't know, Ricky. Are you conspiring? Conspiring to what? To make me miserable, that's what. No, I'm not conspiring to make you miserable. Although I am enjoying it. Yeah, right, I bet you are. Excuse me. What are you doing? Looking for Bella. Bella! Bella, where you at? Baby! Baby! I told you, she's not here. Bella! You're lying. You're lying. Annabella! Annabella! Uh, what the hell do you think you're doing? I'm gonna wait till she gets back. , you're not waiting here, Ricky. Yes, I am. Unless you want to tell me where she is. Wait, let me get this straight. You try and f*ck me behind Annabella's back and now you want me to help you find her? That was a mistake and it was a long time ago. It's never gonna happen again. And I'm not just saying that 'cause of the way you look with that goop on your face. Ricky, you're an asshole. Yeah, I'm working on that. Well, work on it elsewhere. I'm calling the cops. Call the cops. Let's have a party. Give me the TV remote. Get some popcorn and some liquor. I ain't going nowhere until I talk to Annabella. f*ck. Fine. She said she's going to Hoy Como Ayer with a friend tonight. Hoy Como what? What friend? Who? Julie. They're meeting some people there. Julie Greane? Yes. I was lying. You do look like sh1t. You look terrible. You smell, too. Whatever. I look hot as f*ck. Oh, you're missing a piece. Oh. That's a good one. There you go. Mmm. Oh. (Laughs) Oh. No, it's okay, baby. I got it. (chuckles) Was she like this with you? Not exactly. So how long you been teaching at the club, David? He doesn't just teach golf. He's trying to qualify for his tour card. Oh, you want to go pro? That's my dream. I'm number one at the Hooters Tour. You didn't make the Victoria's Secret Tour? Oh... there isn't a Victoria's Secret Tour. I'm aware of that, David. Hey, maybe you could rep me. (chuckles) Yeah, maybe. How long have you been playing? Since I was a child. It's kind of like banging my head into a brick wall over and over again, but I'm not giving up. I love the game. I hated it. It seemed so stupid and boring. And then Jason talked me into taking lessons and then, pow, no more moping around for me. You know, Ma, yoga is also another great way to take your mind off things. Hey, we should all go play a round sometime. Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah. You love the course here. And I've still got Lou's clubs in the closet. You know, they're old, but they're still... you know, they're so pure. I shot a hell of a round with them the other day. You used my father's clubs? Yeah, mine were being regripped. You remember that beautiful bag you got Dad for Father's Day? Hey, we could tee off before my lesson tomorrow. You know, the season's about to start. I'm swamped at the office. Oh, what office? He's got a hundred clients and doesn't even have an assistant. I used to be like that, too. You know, so independent. And then I met your mother and, well, everything's really changed for me. (chuckles) (cracking) (moaning) (clatters loudly) (music playing) (people chatting) You know, Sun Life Stadium would be a good place to spread Roddney. Since you guys both played for the U and then the Fins. Mm-hmm. Lot of good times on that field. And off it. No? What's the problem? I don't know. I think in a way, that's kind of what killed him. All the good times. Has a way of making a man feel invincible. You know, my favorite times of playing were Pop Warner and high school. (chuckles) When things were a lot simpler. You really break it down, we were playing for the love. School pride. Come on. Family. Community. Pussy. Always balling for the pussy. (both laugh) (phone vibrating) What's up, Rick? Having a drink with Spence and Rod. No, I don't know nothing about it. Do not go over there, Ricky. No, it's not a goo... Ricky! We got to roll, man. Ricky's on the warpath again. God. (music playing) There we go, all done. Yep. I'm gonna go watch David Feherty for a bit. The man's a genius. Okay, sweetie. I'll be there in a minute. Jason, nice to meet you. (laughs) All right, dude. If you need me, you know where to find me. Take it easy, bro. He kind of grows on you, right? The only thing growing on me, Ma, is a brain tumor. I remember a few gems you paraded in front of me. And most of them were half your age. That's totally different. Really? How so? They weren't using me to get to you. You really think that that's what he's after? An agent? That's all he talked about all night. Well, he's passionate about his dream. And me. Look, Ma, you don't want to lock it down with this guy, all right? Trust me. There's plenty of guys around here your age that would be lucky to have a woman like you. You're beautiful, you're smart. You're the best. You're my mom. All right. I guess you're right. Of course I'm right. I'll go talk to him. It's gonna be okay. Let him down easy. (music playing) You see him? Ricky :  f*ck you! Excuse me. Excuse me. Coming through. Bella, how you gonna do me like that? Are you crazy, Ricky? Go home. What, so you can get with Jolly Green Giant over here? You better chill out there, Jarret. Are you serious? You're gonna have enough problems dealing with her. Bird. Bird, we're good. Come on, Rick. Everybody just calm the f*ck down. Hey, your boy's nuts, Spencer. He gonna come over here acting all crazy. I'm in the middle of a conversation with Bella. I'm gonna f*ck him up. We got him, Bird. Bella, just come home, baby. If you're so lonely, go back to your Funhouse. I'm sure you can find some company there. Wait, you told... you told her? She had a right to know. I should have never let you into the Funhouse. Don't blame Charles. See, that's your problem, Ricky. It's always somebody did you wrong. Well, I'm done being your cheerleader and your doormat. Fine. Fine. You know what? Have it your own way. If you're gonna get under someone to get over someone, I'm gonna do the same thing. And you, LeBron did the right thing by going back to Cleveland. f*ck you! (overlapping shouting) I'm right here. What do you want to do? I can't stand this sh1t, man. What the f*ck are you doing? You acting out again? You know what the f*ck we were gonna do tonight before we got here? We were gonna go spread Rod's ashes. Now, you remember Rod, right? Got swept up in life and then died doing this sh1t. Acting out just like you're f*cking acting out right now. Think about that sh1t for a second. A second? Man, I think about that sh1t all the time, man. And I know you do, too. I do. I do. So f*ck this. Come with me and Charles and we'll go put him to rest together. Let's do it together. Man, we did that weeks ago, man. All right? I hate to break it to you, but that's just dust in a jar. All right? He is gone and so am I. (TV playing) Man on TV :  ... 72-67, I think, is the first one. And a lot of these holes carry over water. (moaning) So you need bombers who can put the ball high in the air, hit the ball and not get it to roll off these very, very tapered and measured embankments. (TV fades) This is my first time being on the field since I hung up my spikes. How's it feel? Good as hell. Sounds like you want to lace 'em up again. What makes you say that? The look in your eye. Hear it in your voice. I rewrote my unretirement speech at least 15 times. I can't stop missing it, Spence. (laughs) You never will, man. The guys, the routine, the competition. Mm-hmm. Man, I even miss the f*cking jock itch. Yeah, but you got out in one piece. I ain't in one piece, though, Spence. Football made me whole. I know you can't argue that. I can't argue with that. You should do it. You should come back and you should leave it all out on the field. So you never give yourself a reason to ever look back. (whacks ball) Long Island, New York. Jason Antolotti.
