 Is your mom flying in for tonight? 
 No, she's got an early day tomorrow. 
 Doesn't want to red-eye back. She sent me a check. 
 Well, then after the ceremony, let's you and I go out and celebrate. 
 Depends on how late it is. 
 Reese, it's your graduation. 
 You've earned it. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, well, I'll be the guy clapping the loudest. 
 Please don't. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Morning. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, no, don't tell me you lost it again. 
 What? 
 Your wedding ring. 
 Oh, uh... no. 
 I decided it was time to take it off. 
 Can't get used to it not being there, though.

 Abused? 
 Certainly neglected. 
 Yelled at a lot. 
 Look, I don't know what to do. I tried to give him away, but nobody'll take him. 
 How's he feel about you? 
 How should I know? He's a bird. 
 Will you do me a favor, and before you try and give him away again, can I come by and meet him? 
 You wanna meet the parrot? 
 Very much so. 
 How about lunch today? I'll bring sandwiches. 
 Okay. 
 What's wrong with our baby? 
 He's probably just weak, right? 
 From the diarrhea? 
 We've given him fluids, so he's not dehydrated. 
 Was he born prematurely? 
 No. 
 His liver's enlarged. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Was he exposed to any toxins in the house? 
 No, we're careful about that.

 How's the renovation going? Bert's "man cave." 
 You know, I thought it would cheer him up, but he's not showing any interest at all. 
 I feel like I'm being punished for not retiring with him. 
 Rough at home, huh? 
 That's an understatement.

 All right, let's go over here. 
 Cardiomegaly. 
 What? 
 Michael's heart is enlarged. 
 What would cause that? 
 Given everything else, I'd say we're looking at a genetic disease. 
 How can that be? We're both fine. 
 You could each be carrying one faulty recessive gene which, when paired together, can express in Michael. 
 Dr. Manning, BP and sats are dropping.

 He's been off the lorazepam for two hours, and he still hasn't woken up, and he's still completely reliant on the vent. 
 [sighs] So you needed me to tell you he should have come to by now? 
 No, I needed you to tell me why he hasn't. 
 Could it just be that his poor liver function is preventing him from metabolizing the lorazepam? 
 Dr. Rhodes, you called a neurosurgeon in to consult. 
 Obviously, you suspect something else. 
 I'm afraid he might have stroked on the table. 
 And you were hoping I'd tell you otherwise.

 Eh, take care of him. 
 Talk to him. Hang out with him. 
 For starters, teach him something else to say. 
 [laughs] 
 Don't touch that. 
 We've extracted DNA from the baby and both parents, and the DNA samples have been prepared, so that we can load it into the sequencer, which will give us the genetic code of each. 
 Once we have that, we can target specific parts of the baby's genome, based on the baby's symptoms, and give a gene-based diagnosis.

 I've got TB? 
 [solemn music] 
 Yeah, I'm afraid so.
