 See? Taking a header at your first marathon is nothing. 
 Now, taking a header into a pool in your wedding dress?

 No, that would be taking 20 minutes to put on a Band-Aid. 
 Sorry. Totally my fault. 
 No, no, not at all.

 No. Maybe a bedroom activity. 
 Or kitchen table.

 Marathon traffic and power outages from the heat have paramedics backed up. 
 We're on our own for a while. 
 Well, he doesn't have a while. He needs a chest tube now. 
 Not from you. You've never put one in.

 I understand Phoebe's experiencing some hearing loss?

 Sort of. 
 A little. 
 Okay, her hearing is diminished on the right side and nearly absent on the left. 
 Does she have any prior history of head trauma or hearing loss? 
 No. Not that I can think of. 
 I mean, there have been a few times where I've had to call her more than once within these last few months, but nothing like this. 
 Okay, well, I'd like to order a head CT just so we can figure out what's going on, okay? 
 Okay.

 Yeah, it might... there's no guarantee I could even find it.

 Well, last night cured me of that. 
 The hospital is over-scheduling, Ms. Goodwin. 
 Well, maybe someone thought we needed the revenue. 
 I'll look into it.

 You know that. 
 I want to go home. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Phoebe, I promise the CT is not gonna hurt, okay? 
 It's just like getting your picture taken, but in the meantime, will you do me a favor? 
 Can you color a picture for the doctors' lounge? 
 Yeah? 
 Because of the marathon, the hospital's way busier than usual, but it shouldn't be too much longer. 
 Okay. 
 And do you mind if we speak for a moment? 
 Sure. 
 Great. 
 Hey. I'll be right outside, okay, sweetie? 
 So you indicated in Phoebe's chart that her father was deceased. 
 I'm wondering why she would want to call him? 
 David had a massive coronary and died a few months ago. 
 I haven't had the heart to tell her. 
 I am so sorry. 
 He was away on business. 
 I feel awful for lying, but I just know that she'll be crushed, and I don't know how to break it to her. 
 Yeah, well, you know, we have a really great doctor that may be able to help with that. 
 But in the meantime, just hang in there. 
 We'll get Phoebe up to CT soon, okay? 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Rhodes? 
 Dr. Halstead has a patient in the field with a torn aorta. 
 He's putting him on a portable bypass. 
 Seriously? A portable bypass? 
 You can't regulate blood flow to the brain. 
 Well, you can debate the medicine with Dr. Halstead when he gets here. 
 Believe me, I will. 
 [tense music] 
 There's blood in the tube. 
 [crowd cheering] 
 Saturation's 75%. 
 Must be a pulmonary laceration. 
 We got to pack his lung and get the blood out of that tube before he drowns. 
 You want to pack the chest, and I'll suction the tube? 
 With what free hand? 
 I'll suction the tube. 
 I'll pack the chest. 
 Give me the suction. 
 Noah, grab both sides, and try to keep 'em open.

 It's closing on my wrist. I can't hold this. 
 Don't let go. 
 Come on, Noah, pull! 
 Don't let go! [grunting] 
 All right. I got most of the blood. 
 Sat's at 95%. 
 Ribs, ribs, grab the ribs. 
 Got it.

 Mrs. Barlow? 
 You gave us a scare. How are you feeling? 
 Oh, I'm... I'm much better, Doctor, thank you. 
 Your reaction to the pain medication surprised us, because that dose shouldn't have been an issue for you. 
 Have you been taking everything as prescribed? 
 I didn't mention it before, because it's... 
 It's so embarrassing, but I accidentally spilled some pills into the toilet, so I haven't taken everything I was supposed to. 
 Mrs. Barlow, skipping doses is very dangerous. 
 You should have called your doctor. 
 Well, I certainly know better now. 
 I won't let it happen again. 
 There's one other thing. 
 I was reviewing your labs, and some of the numbers indicate that you haven't been eating as well as you should. 
 No one, except my late husband, has ever accused me of being a good cook. 
 Well, wait till you taste the hospital food. 
 [chuckles] 
 Excuse me. 
 Dr. Charles, I have a patient I'd like you to evaluate. 
 She's 74, lives alone, and for some reason hasn't been taking her meds.

 It might be dementia or depression. 
 I'm just not sure. 
 I'll have a little chat.

 Mrs. Barlow? I'm Dr. Charles. 
 How are we doing today? 
 Pleased to meet you, Dr. Charles. 
 Dr. Choi mentioned that you were having some trouble with your medication, and he asked me to look in on you. 
 Of course, but this is all just a big mistake. 
 Tell me, how did you end up here today? 
 I spilled some pills and didn't take all my medication. 
 It's so boring. 
 Huh. 
 Charles. That's an English name isn't it? 
 Yes, it is. 
 Mm. 
 My late husband Robert was English. 
 He had a Charles on his mother's side. 
 Have you been? 
 Not for a while. 
 Mm. 
 Well, when I was quite a bit younger, Robert and I took the final voyage on the RMS "Queen Elizabeth" across the pond from New York. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 That sounds like quite a trip. 
 Oh, it was. 
 1968. 
 There was a sense of design back then that you just don't see today. 
 Now it's... it's all screens, and technology, and people have forgotten the importance of style, haven't they? 
 Boy, you can say that again. 
 [gasps softly] 
 I'm sorry for running on like that. 
 Was there something else you wanted to ask me? 
 You know, I think that I'm all set. 
 Thank you. It was so nice to meet you. 
 It was really nice to meet you, Dr. Charles. 
 So in my opinion, Mrs. Barlow is competent and definitely a bit of a charmer. 
 One who's not taking her meds or eating properly. 
 Not suicidal. 
 Not depressed as far as I can tell. 
 I mean, what she is, is she's nostalgic for a more refined culture... which is a far cry from eating cat food. 
 She told you she was eating cat food? 
 Look at her blood work. 
 Raised taurine level. That's the telltale sign. 
 I thought she was lying about eating regularly, but cat food? 
 Mm-hmm, this happens when money's tight. 
 You know, elderly woman. Fixed income. 
 She'd be way too embarrassed to say anything. 
 What about dropping her pills in the toilet? 
 You think that's a lie too? 
 Oxycodone, sildenafil, benzos all have a very high street value, buddy. 
 You think this sweet old lady's selling them to get money? 
 Sweet old lady in need, man. 
 I've seen it before. 
 You know, and the sad part is, is, even selling her meds, she doesn't seem to be making ends meet.

 Wonderful to meet you. 
 Sorry it's under such difficult circumstances.

 It's a busy day for us. 
 I understand. 
 Now, would you prefer that I call you Ms. Goodwin or Sharon? 
 Oh, Sharon is fine. 
 Sharon, before we go any further, are you sure that you don't want to try to reconcile? 
 While legal separation is not a divorce, it is a big step down that road. 
 We're past trying to reconcile. 
 I know we talked a little bit about this on the phone, but pending court approval, you and your spouse are agreeing to live independent of each other, both financially and physically. 
 Which we have been for months. 
 Illinois law allows a spouse who is without fault to receive reasonable support and maintenance while parties are living apart. 
 We would need to ask the court to determine that amount. 
 I don't want anything from him. 
 In that case, when you're ready, I just need you to sign at the bottom of both copies. 
 Ms. Kastpen? 
 Yes? 
 I'm Dr. Charles, and this is Dr. Reese. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Dr. Manning mentioned that you were struggling with how to break the news of your husband's death to your daughter. 
 Oh, yes. 
 We were thinking that if we all sat down, we might be able to help you come up with a plan to... how to best discuss this with Phoebe. 
 [clears throat] 
 You know, I really appreciate you're trying to help, but the timing is just all wrong. 
 Phoebe is scared enough just being here. 
 I can't add stress to her right now. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 I think she's lying to us. 
 The pause before answering, throat clearing, and hand-to-face activity all point to her not being truthful. 
 Just so you know, all that behavioral cue stuff about how to spot liars: bunch of hooey. 
 Having said that...

 I am. 
 Good. 
 I'm glad to hear that, because sometimes people skip meals when they're finding it hard to get by. 
 Get by?

 Hi. 
 So after I observed the weakness in Phoebe's hand, I ran some tests on the blood work we took, and the results showed an explanation for her hearing loss. 
 She has a genetic condition called osteopetrosis. 
 What? 
 It's a bone disease that can cause progressive hearing loss. 
 It also explains the carpal tunnel that's causing weakness in her wrists. 
 But I don't have it, and neither does her father. 
 It just means that you and her father are both genetic carriers. 
 Is she gonna be deaf? 
 Not necessarily. 
 We've had some success in treating the condition with bone marrow transplants. 
 Okay. 
 What aren't you telling me? 
 Osteopetrosis makes bones abnormally dense and prone to breakage, which explains her skull fractures. 
 What I'm trying to say is, I don't think she was ever abused. 
 Oh, my God. 
 He didn't hurt her?

 She thought she was doing the right thing. 
 She risked everything and lost everything to get her daughter out of harm's way, and we're sending her to jail. 
 I understand why she did it, but couldn't she have had a doctor evaluate Phoebe before going on the run? 
 She messed up so many lives. 
 Yeah, but... it still feels wrong.
