 [bird squawks] 
 Have you seen my coat? 
 It's right here. 
 Don't touch that. Get away, get away. 
 [laughs softly] 
 It's really taking to you. 
 Ha, funny. 
 No, he really has. 
 It's because I'm the one with the food. 
 That's why I took to you. 
 Really? 
 That mean if I feed you some seeds you'll forget about teaching this course? 
 And miss two months in Bethesda? 
 It's the vacation capital of Montgomery County. 
 [squawks] Get away, get away. 
 [laughs softly] 
 Don't touch that. Get away. 
 [laughter] 
 [bird squawks] 
 Hmm. 
 They charge you twice for your cable again? 
 No, I got offered a job. 
 Yeah? That's great. 
 I guess. 
 It's in California. 
 Oh. 
 But I mean, that's okay, right? 
 It's nice out there. 
 Yeah, definitely. 
 It's just... just far. 
 Have you heard from Rush yet? 
 Northwestern? 
 Uh, still waiting. 
 Course, there's always a chance things could work out here. 
 Very slim chance. 
 Hey, you two. 
 Patients incoming. 
 You're going to Treatment 6. 
 April, you got this? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Right here. 
 What do we got? 
 Chuck Gleason, 42-year-old male. 
 Found at the bottom of some stairs on Lower Wacker with a fractured left tibia. 
 Okay, on my count. 
 One, two, three. 
 Oh. 
 He looks dehydrated. 
 Let's call ortho and start some fluids. 
 Oh. 
 On it. 
 Starter 1, let's get him set up. 
 Let's pull the board out. 
 You got a drink, April? 
 Could really use a drink. 
 Are you guys friends? 
 Frequent flier. 
 Alcohol. 
 And everything that goes with it. 
 How 'bout you, buddy? 
 You got a drink? 
 Unfortunately, this is a hospital, not a bar. 
 When did this happen? 
 Yesterday. 
 Oh. 
 101. 
 All right, let's get a chest X-ray and a UA. 
 Okay. 
 [groans] 
 Okay, Mr. Gleason, you broke your leg pretty bad. 
 We're gonna have to evaluate this and... 
 He's seizing. 
 Mr. Gleason? 
 All right, milligram of Ativan. 
 On it. 
 It's a grand mal seizure. 
 He ever had this before? 
 Not that I've seen. 
 Milligram of Ativan. 
 He's withdrawing. 
 He's going into delirium tremens. 
 You know. 
 Never seen him get DTs before. 
 It's gonna be bad, isn't it? 
 Is it ever good? 
 [dramatic music] 
 [sighs] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Hey. Thanks for the bird. 
 Kids are gonna love it. 
 Definitely. Glad he'll have a nice home. 
 Yeah. Anything I need to know? 
 Nope. 
 Just enjoy. 
 All right, you're a good man, Doc. 
 [chuckles] 
 [siren wails in distance] 
 Cirrhosis, hepatitis, cardiomyopathy, renal failure. 
 Reads like the index of "Harrison's Guide to Internal Medicine." 
 [retches] 
 [panting] 
 Ah. 
 Ah! 
 Mr. Gleason, when was your last drink? 
 Two nights ago, which is why I need to get the hell out of here. 
 Afraid I can't do that. 
 Talk to this guy, will you please? 
 I'm sorry, Chuck, the doctor's in charge. 
 No, I'm in charge, okay? 
 I'm in charge. I know my rights. 
 I don't have to stay here if I don't want to stay here. 
 That's very true, but you're not going to get far on that leg without ortho taking care of it. 
 Okay, fine, man. 
 It's cool. 
 W-w-what are we talking about here, two hours? 
 Mr. Gleason, you're going through delirium tremens. 
 Your body is so used to the presence of alcohol that it's reacting violently to its absence. 
 Blah, blah, blah! 
 We need to keep you here a day or so till you get through it. 
 Ain't gonna happen, man. 
 Okay? 
 I seen what happens with the DTs. 
 I can't go through that, please. 
 We can't stop them, but we have given you a sedative to make it easier. 
 I'm sorry, but at this point, it's no longer safe for you to leave. 
 [whimpers] 
 [vomits] 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [retches] 
 Hey, Maggie, can you call ortho and see what's taking so long? 
 Sure can. 
 Hey. 
 Where's your wedding ring? 
 I-I don't know. 
 Um... I had it on when I got here. 
 You didn't put it in your locker? 
 No, I never take it off. 
 Well, where else have you been? 
 Re-trace your steps. 
 I've been in and out of five rooms, washing my hands. 
 I mean, who knows how many gloves I've taken on and off? 
 [tense music] 
 Maggie. 
 All right, all right, I got this. 
 Everyone, listen up. 
 We're missing a gold wedding band, so take a room and search every inch of it. 
 From now on, nothing leaves the ED. 
 Every sheet, every gown, every piece of trash gets bagged and stored until I search it. 
 Got that? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Hey, we're gonna find it, okay? 
 I'm gonna check in the lounge. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So this is Rose Wechsler, 83. 
 Arrived from her nursing facility confused and agitated. 
 Ms. Wechsler, good morning. 
 Baloney. 
 Are you here for the sink? 
 You know, I'm not. 
 But it would help me out a great deal if you would tell me what year it was. 
 Check your damn calendar. 
 No wonder you people never show up on time. 
 That's completely my fault. 
 Do you mind if I just shine... 
 What are you, some kind of a maniac? 
 Get the hell out of here! 
 Thank you. 
 Out! 
 Lovely to meet you. 
 What do you think? 
 [sighs] Nursing home delirium. 
 Acute cognitive dysfunction from some combination of dehydration, stasis, over-medication, and a lack of human engagement. 
 Could be. 
 She's neurologically intact but her mucous membranes are dry. 
 If you're right, fluids will perk her up. 
 Mm, yeah, for now. 
 What? 
 Well, I'm sorry, it's just that her records indicate she led a remarkable life. 
 Was one of the first female test pilots, trained at NASA. 
 Even if fluids work, it's sad seeing someone like that wind up like this. 
 Well... 
 Incoming! Dr. Choi. 
 We're going to Baghdad. 
 [alarm beeps] 
 [indistinct P.A. announcement] 
 On it. 
 Talk to me. 
 Frank McCormick. Here's his EKG. 
 42, lost his rhythm again in the van. 
 Shocked from v-fib in the field. 
 Hang in there, Frank, it's going to be okay. 
 Excuse us, ma'am. 
 Let's rotate. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 All right, let's transfer him on my count. 
 One, two, three. 
 Transfer. 
 Dr. Choi, what have you got? 
 STEMI. A big one.

 Yes. 
 He had a heart attack.

 [machine beeping] 
 Heart rate's back to 65. 
 Pressure's 115 over 60. 
 All right, let's get him up to the cath lab. 
 Based on his EKG, he's gonna need a bypass. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Watch the lines. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Wait. 
 Did you say he needs a bypass? Yes, ma'am. 
 We got your husband's rhythm back, but he's still not out of the woods. 
 We need to find the blockage that caused his heart attack and most likely, we will graft new vessels on around it. 
 But that means going on a heart-lung machine, right? 
 Yes, it does. 
 Then I'll have to refuse. 
 Refuse? What? 
 My husband can't have any surgery that involves the administration of blood. 
 We're Jehovah's Witnesses. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Stop! 
 Stop it! Get it off of me. 
 They're inside of this thing now. 
 Chuck, you're hallucinating again. 
 It's part of the DTs. 
 We're gonna increase your sedatives. 
 I don't want a sedative. 
 How many times do I got to tell you that? 
 I don't need a sedative. I don't need a sedative. 
 I need a drink. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 Then get the hell out of here! 
 Hey, how long have I known you? 
 Years. 
 Every time you come in here, you are sicker. 
 One of these times you're going to be too far gone. 
 Chuck, listen to me. 
 You're never gonna beat this if you give in now. 
 [crying] I'm never gonna beat this. 
 I ain't beating nothing. 
 Please help. Make it stop. 
 Please, please, make it stop. 
 I'm trying to help you. 
 [vomits] 
 [clears throat] 
 [gags] 
 I told you... I told you how to help me, but you don't listen. 
 Going to increase your sedatives, and I'm going to get you a clean blanket. 
 I don't need a clean blanket. 
 I need a drink. 
 Youse are killing me with all your help! 
 [dark music] 
 Frank, we respect your beliefs, we do. 
 But the fact is, you're going to have another heart attack. 
 The only question is when. 
 You page me? 
 This is Dr. Downey, our top cardiothoracic surgeon. 
 I was just explaining to the McCormicks that unfortunately surgery is the only option that we have left. 
 And I was explaining that we need an alternative that doesn't involve the administration of blood. 
 It is his own blood. 
 It's re-circulated. 
 Blood contains the gift of life. 
 Once it leaves the body, it's contaminated forever. 
 I know you think we're being difficult, but this isn't just about the danger that Frank's body is in right now. 
 It's about he and I being able to spend eternity together. 
 We understand, but you have to... 
 What about bloodless surgery? 
 What's that? 
 It's where we do it off-pump. 
 Operate on the heart while it's still beating. 
 [tense music] 
 You can do that? 
 Yes. 
 Though it comes with significant risks. 
 For the McCormicks, the heart-lung machine is a risk. 
 Stopping the heart, removing the blood to oxygenate it, then putting it back violates their faith, so let's do it without the machine. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Excuse us for a moment. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 He's got bad three vessel disease. 
 He's a terrible candidate. 
 It's too high of a risk. 
 Higher than not doing anything at all? 
 Let's at least give them some time to see if they want to choose the safer option. 
 We don't want to wait. 
 We want to do the bloodless surgery. 
 Okay. 
 I'll inform the OR. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Please, it's a lot... 
 Please. 
 You need to up his benzos. 
 I already did, twice. 
 Then give him a milligram of Haldol, too. 
 [sighs] 
 I'll tell you, when I was a clinical nurse I used to dread DT patients. 
 I know, such misery. 
 And most of the time they're back in two months to do it all over again. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I lost my wedding ring recently, didn't find it for three days. 
 What did Bert say? 
 You know, he didn't say anything, which was weird because he's usually so observant. 
 Huh. 
 Oh, excuse me. Daniel. 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 Mm, working, why? 
 Well, an old friend of Bert's and mine has moved to town and I thought we could all go to dinner. 
 You know, sounds like a blast but I really am slammed. 
 Come on, Daniel. 
 Bert's been so grumpy lately, and he always cheers up when he talks to you. 
 What's going on? 
 It's a long story, but you'd really be helping me out. 
 Besides, Maribel loves Scotch and ballroom dancing. 
 You haven't been out in a while. 
 You know, there's a reason for that. 
 There's this new study out, says dating can lead to marriage. 
 It's just a friendly dinner. 
 Yeah, and I'm still paying two and a half alimonies. 
 Those friendly dinners can get expensive. 
 Ooh, Ms. Reese, any word on that nursing home patient? 
 Actually, there is. 
 Daniel. 
 I got to go. 
 Thank you so much for the invite. 
 Best to Bert. 
 We'll do it next time. 
 So the good news is, Ms. Wechsler's doing much better after some fluids. 
 She's awake and alert. 
 That is good news. 
 Yes, though she does still have a fever and is reporting lower abdominal pain. 
 Fluids and scans? 
 All negative except for a slightly elevated white count, but I'm already doing an infectious workup now. 
 Sounds like a great plan. 
 What's the bad news? 
 This is Wanda Stern. 
 In from the same nursing home. 
 She has a 101 fever and feels Nixon is just what this country needs to run out the commies. 
 Fluids and labs? 
 Fluids and labs. 
 Hey. 
 Sorry about your ring. 
 It's so stupid. 
 I can't believe I lost it. 
 No, no, no. Come on. 
 These things, they happen. 
 No, illnesses happen. 
 Bad weather happens. 
 This is on me. 
 Look, I'm on all your patients, so don't worry, okay? 
 Just... try to take it easy. 
 I feel so terrible. 
 Like, like I betrayed Jeff, like I didn't care enough.

 Nothing, it's a personal item. 
 Is that a bottle of booze?

I care about getting our patient through this. Does he look like he's getting through this? He needs a drink. I didn't say it would be easy, but that? That's just a Band-Aid. I come in here every day and I put Band-Aids on patients and most of them thank me for it. And he may thank you, but you're not helping him. And you are? Standing around while he dies in front of us? This man has a chance to get past his problem and make a new start. He's telling us that he doesn't want that, and it's up to us to listen. No, no, no, no. It's not my job to listen. I'm a doctor. It's my job to decide what is best for him. That is exactly why I'm a nurse. ♪ ♪

You guys are just being overly cautious because it's me. Nat, that's darn right that's what we're doing. Stop being stubborn and listen to the man, please? Let's go. Ugh. On Wednesdays, I go downstairs to the beauty shop. My neighbor Sheila always does my hair. Okay. How about the card room? I play a lot of canasta. In the south lobby? No, darling. Uh, in the north. Oh. How we doing, ladies? Any luck? Wanda here is lovely, and though I appreciate your theory that our conditions may arise from the same source, I'm afraid the only thing we have in common is Sinai Gardens. Ah. Ms. Reese, could I, um... could I talk to you for a moment? Mm-hmm. Keep at it. [sighs] Their labs are all negative, but both are febrile with leukocytosis, and infections in the elderly can present quite differently than normal. I think we need to start looking for zebras. Rickettsia, leptospirosis... Ms. Stern had some redness in her left eye. You notice that? Probably from the chlorine in the pool. She likes to do water aerobics. But consider the symptoms. Acute delirium, severe dehydration, lower abdominal pain, one itchy red eye. Like I said, in an 85-year-old, it could be anything. If these women were closer to you in age, what might you suspect? [gasps] [tense music] No. No, no, no, no, no. Why not? No. Because they're old ladies. They can't have gonorrhea.
