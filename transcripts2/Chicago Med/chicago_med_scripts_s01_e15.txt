 [laughter] 
 Isn't it finally time you admitted I'm quicker? 
 Old man. 
 All : Ooh! 
 These young boys always come out the side of they mouth. 
 Uh, what you run the 40 in at the Combine? 
 Um, 4.46. 
 That's good, that's fast. 4.42. 
 Ooh! 
 Oh. 
 If you even, I'm leaving, baby. 
 You got to keep up, know what I'm saying? 
 You got it. 
 Come on. 
 [both laughing] 
 I literally have no idea what just happen. 
 Baby, now you know how I feel when I come pick you up from work. 
 Everybody run around, talking about, "Let me get 50ccs of epi, STAT," or something. I'm like... 
 [laughter] 
 50ccs of epi? You trying to kill my patient? 
 Baby, mm. 
 [laughs] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Doc in the house. 
 [laughs] What's good? 
 What's going on, man? 
 Good, man. 
 Hey, let me set you up with a beverage. 
 Yeah, sure, sure. 
 Noah? 
 Hey. 
 What's up, man? 
 What's happening, brother? 
 What's up? 
 Got to get these fellas ready for morning practice. 
 Gonna get your fast break on point tomorrow, I'm telling you. 
 Sounds good. Come on. 
 All right. I'll be right back. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What's he doing here? 
 I... 
 He said he wanted to meet some players. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So what's all this, man? 
 All right, so this is my recovery ultra, okay? 
 It's filled with electrolytes and antioxidants. 
 Yeah, that sounds real good. 
 But first, I want to get you guys started with some B-12, okay? 
 [solemn music] 
 Babe? 
 [sighs] 
 I got to go home. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing, I just have an early shift in the morning. 
 Okay, I'll drive you. 
 No, no, no. 
 Stay with your friends. I-I just texted for a ride. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Honeymooners with food poisoning, take 'em to four. 
 You can say it. 
 What? 
 You were right about athletes. 
 Ah, what happened? 
 Help! 
 [groans] 
 Get me a gurney. 
 Dr. Manning, we're going to six. 
 Oh, my stomach is on fire! 
 What's your name, sweetheart? 
 Ellie Newman. 
 [groans] 
 It's okay, we're gonna take good care of you, all right? 
 Get me a gurney. 
 I'm on it, Maggie. 
 Get ready to raise the head. 
 [gags] 
 Let's start an IV. 
 On it. 
 [coughs] 
 Are you her father? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 She eat anything that could have made her sick? 
 No-she ate what I ate. 
 How old is your daughter? 
 She's 16. 
 She on any medications? 
 Any medical issues we should know about? 
 I-I don't think so. I don't know. 
 When did this start? 
 Uh, last night. 
 [moaning] 
 Did you take any drugs? 
 Alcohol? Were you at a party? 
 No, I was just trying on my prom dress. 
 Oh, baby. 
 BP is 138/88. Heart rate 112, stats 99%. 
 Give her 0.2 of hydromorphone. 
 No, no drugs! 
 Sweetie, you are in pain. Let us help you. 
 No, I don't want any drugs! 
 She doesn't want to end up like me. 
 [dramatic music] 
 ♪ ♪ FAST is negative, I-STAT labs are normal. So it's probably not a surgical issue? I'd like to put a scope in her just to make sure we're not missing anything. Without pain meds? We could try a non-narcotic. Maybe she'll go for that. [sighs] Hi, Ellie, Mr. Newman, this is Dr. Rhodes, our trauma surgeon. I've asked him to consult. [groans] Has Ellie ever experienced this before? Um... A year ago. A year ago. How long did it last? Maybe, like, three weeks. Your daughter was sick like this for three weeks, and you didn't know? I was... Strung out? Yeah. [sighs] Ellie, we're gonna give you a painkiller that's non-narcotic. I don't want anything. The girl won't even take two aspirin. [dark music] Did you see a doctor for your last attack? But he couldn't find anything. He sent me to a psychologist. But I'm not making this up. Don't worry, Ellie, we're gonna get to the bottom of this. [sighs] ♪ ♪ I don't know, she's in a lot of pain. Maybe it is psychological. I'll page Dr. Charles. Dr. Rhodes? Yep. Your sister's on line two. Uh, right, tell her I need to reschedule. Like you did last week? Yes, Maggie, like I did last week. Ms. Rhodes, he's with a patient. He said he won't be able to make lunch today, but he'll call you back to reschedule. Okay. Hey, Maggie. Do you by any chance know of a good contractor? For what? I'm thinking about turning the basement into a man cave for Bert. Oh, trying to buy him off so he'll stop bugging you about retiring. Something like that. Yeah, I got a cousin, not too big a crook. Text me his number. I will. Dr. Halstead. Maggie. I got a patient in two that's from your old hood, Canaryville. Thought you might be interested. Sure. Vitals? BP 164/90, heart rate 92, Sat 99%. Okay, Mr... .Tucker. You got to be kidding me. [laughs] Ginger Spice is our doctor. No way. Ginger Spice? Ah, what they called me back at De La Salle. How about we get a real doctor? Dr. Halstead is a real doctor, an excellent doctor. It's okay Reese, this is how we gentlemen relate in Canaryville. Andrew, what's going on with that leg? Swelled up during my truck route. Pain won't let up. Push on my hand, like you're stepping on the gas. Come on. [exhales] All right, how long ago did the pain start? About 12 hours. Why didn't you say something? I would've had Pete take over your deliveries. Wasn't this bad at first. You on any medication? No. Still smoke? Been cutting back. Alcohol? Not much since this one bumped me up to transpo coordinator. Gotta be ready to cover any driver who calls out. Hey, you should ask Ginger about the fight we had in high school. Caught him staring at my girl. How many times I knock you on your ass? A hundred? Sounds about right. Ever had any pain or swelling like this before? Any shortness of breath? No. Okay, well, we're gonna start with some basic labs and get a duplex scan of your legs and we'll take it from there. So, where you living now, Ginger? Gold Coast? Not quite. I'll get those orders started. Were they always like that? The Tucker brothers were very popular, and they loved sticking it to us lesser mortals. Go ahead and order an ultrasound of Mr. Tucker's leg. April. Hi. How's my guy? Better. Much better. Coming in for Eric's check-up upstairs. Cool. Hold on, hold on. You got little hands. See if you can untangle these. I can do it. All right. Please? Just wanted to make sure you're okay. You left in a bit of a hurry. Look, um... I don't know if this was such a good idea. Wait, what do you mean? Last night, just not my scene. It's not mine either. I'm... okay, it used to be, but I got Eric now. Things are different. Just wanted you to meet some old friends, that's all. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't know. I have to get back to work. Daddy, I did it! [chuckles] Good job. Bye. [whimpering] It's a tough situation, man. 16 years old, taking care of herself and her heroin-addicted father, doing it for years. She said she was trying on her prom dress, I mean, could that have been some kind of trigger, and maybe the pain is psychosomatic? Possibly, I don't really know enough to make that call. We have to figure out what's going on. The only way we're gonna do that is if we scope her. We can't, unless we get her to accept pain meds or an anesthetic. Uhhuh. Given her family history, we have to take her concern for addiction very seriously. Okay, so what do we do? Well, how about a good, old-fashioned topical numbing agent? You know, worth a shot. [whimpering] That's okay, sweetie, we will take care of them. Dr. Choi, April. Doris, open that door. Neela Desai, 32 weeks pregnant and contracting. Got it. Let's rotate the chair. Mommy. Go with the nurse, okay? Let's take them to the break room to get a snack, okay? [breathing heavily] Okay, Mama. We're going to take care of your mommy, and then we're gonna come and get you, okay? [groans] Okay, let's go. Go ahead, love, take them to the break room. Lie back so the doctor can examine you. There you go. [groaning] Take this out, please. Okay. Okay, you're in good hands, love. [breathing heavily] Okay. I can't have this baby. It's not due for another two months. Page O.B. BP 142/90. That's high, probably due to anxiety or the pain. Just to be safe, I'm gonna order some labs, okay? [moans] [dramatic music] You're gonna feel a little pressure. She's bleeding from the cervix. Grab six gram mag bolus, and call O.B., tell 'em we're coming up. Wait, what's going on? Ms. Desai, you may be experiencing an abruption. Your placenta is separating from the wall of your uterus. The overall picture suggests something called pre-eclampsia with HELLP syndrome. What... what does that mean? It means we need to deliver this baby now. No, no, no, no, no. I know. 32 weeks is more premature than we like, but right now, your baby's safer outside of your body than inside. Yeah, I can't deliver this baby premature, this is not my baby. ♪ ♪ I'm a surrogate. I'm carrying this baby for someone else. I need to carry it to term or I don't get paid. If we don't deliver now, this condition could be fatal for both you and the baby. Yeah, I need the money. Ms. Desai, I don't... No! No, we just got out of the shelter, okay? I'm not putting my boys through another Chicago winter in one, so please, help me. ♪ ♪ It was nice talking to you. How'd she do on the psych eval? In my opinion, Ms. Desai is competent, capable of making her own decisions. Mentally, she's stable. How can she be stable? She's risking her life and the baby's. She has no genetic connection to that baby, Ethan. Another couple's fertilized egg is implanted in her womb. For her, it's about making enough money to take care of her kids. Then that's it, then. We have to respect the patient's wishes. We can't force her to deliver. You expect me to just wait for her to die? Well, I'll call her surrogacy agency, see if they can help us find a solution. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Trucks are on their way, just running a little late. We're backed up with me out of the office today. Let me call you back. You finally figured out what's going on? Duplex scan shows that the swelling of your leg is being caused by a DVT. Deep vein thrombosis. A what? Okay, English, Halstead. You've got a blood clot in your leg. So how do you fix it? Blood thinners. Enoxaparin is where I'd start. Hold on. Most of the time, administering blood thinner like enoxaparin would be the right answer, but given Andrew's history, I'm leery of doing that. It could cause intra-cranial hemorrhaging. Bleeding? Yes, in the brain. I remember you getting into your fair share of scuffles back in high school. Is that still the case? Only when the Packers are in town. When you've experienced trauma to the head, blood thinners are more likely to make your brain bleed, cause you to stroke...  possibly die. Whoa. I'm gonna make sure that doesn't happen. For now, I'd like to get a CT scan of your head to establish a baseline, then we'll wait and see. Wait, that's your plan? Wait and see? A nurse will be by to take you for that scan. Well, I hope you know what you're doing, Ginger. Connor? Hey. Hey. Looks like I need to check into the ER to spend any time with you. Claire, I'm sorry, it's just been really busy around here. You're avoiding me. I'm not avoiding you. It's because of Dad, isn't it? You hate that I don't hate him. You're not being fair. Listen, Mom's suicide, I know you blame him, but... But Mom had real problems. That's not exactly how I remember it. That's because, believe it or not, Dad tried to shield us. He kept us away when Mom spiraled into a black hole. You don't remember, but I do. Call me, Connor...  when you're ready. [dark music] ♪ ♪ Noah? Hey. What were you doing last night? Just a little entrepreneurship. Big market for banana bags... Noah. What? It's a legitimate business. You're not a doctor yet, you're not supposed to be sticking needles in people. Yeah, but I'm gonna be. This is why we all worked so hard to send you to medical school? So you could keep a bunch of party animals from getting hangovers? I'm just trying to earn a few extra bucks, only way I can pay you back. I never asked you to pay me back. I want to. And what about Mom and Dad? Oh, so you're just doing this to help the family? April, let me do my thing. You are so full of it. And you're mad at me? All right, this is gonna numb your mouth and throat. You're still gonna feel some pressure in your esophagus. It's the best we can do without anesthetic. Hopefully you'll be able to tolerate the scope. Mm-hmm. Okay. Here's this. [sighs] Okay, here we go. [tense music] [gags] [groaning] You okay? ♪ ♪ [gagging] Slow, deep breaths through your nose, okay? Here, squeeze my hand. Ellie, I'm gonna do this as fast as I can. I'm sorry. [gagging] ♪ ♪ [coughs] It's okay. [panting] It's okay. [groans] I'm sorry. It's okay. Nurse Doris is gonna stay with you. Just give us a second. [whimpers] Thank you. I have got to talk to her father. [whimpering] ♪ ♪ Mr. Newman, I can't stand to see your daughter in this much pain. I need your permission to give Ellie pain medication. I don't tell Ellie what to do. It's sort of a deal we have with each other. I understand, but we just need to sedate her this once, so we can perform the endoscopy. This will not turn her into an addict. Your daughter is overwhelmed with pain and depleted from vomiting. She cannot make the best decision in this state. But Ellie's a minor. You are her father. You can make this decision. I don't know. I don't...  I don't know. Ellie needs you to step up, Mr. Newman, to be her father. ♪ ♪ [sighs] Um... [sniffs] ♪ ♪ Okay. Uh, do it. Do what you have to do, I guess. Okay, thank you. Yeah. ♪ ♪ 
 
 [gasping] Okay, he can't breathe! Help him, Halstead, help him! Sinus tach? 133. Sat? 86. He threw a pulmonary embolism. Embolism? What is that? Get oxygen on him. Okay, what is going on? Need some help in here! You should have given him the blood thinners! Hey, you need to step out of the room, now. My brother, you are killing... Reese! Hey! Hey! Get a crash cart in here! Give me the bag. He's turning blue! [groans] He's too big to lift. I'm intubating here. Come on, hey, breathe. 20 of etomidate and 100 of sux, now! Yes, Doctor. All right. Breathe, Andy. Come on, Andy. What's he doing? Okay, I'm in. Call the MICU and the pulmonary team, get 'em down here immediately. What is happening? Why isn't he breathing? Clot moved from his leg to his lung. What did you do to my brother? [dramatic music] Heart rate's up to 130. BP's rising. [groans] I'm afraid she'll have a dysrhythmia. [groaning] Push 50 of fentanyl. No! What's that? No, what's that? It's gonna help you. [groans] No! Ellie? Wait, no! Ellie, we have to do this. It'll help us figure out what's going on with you. No! It's okay. It'll only help. [whimpers] [cries] It's okay. [groans] It's okay. [groaning] Nothing? No. [sighs] Maybe her condition is psychological. Dr. Manning, a quick word? Yeah. I understand that you gave Ellie a narcotic. The numbing spray wouldn't work. Sedating her was the only way we could perform the endoscopy. Was it worth it? The endoscopy was inconclusive. Mm-hmm. I thought that we concluded that staying away from narcotics was this Ellie's top priority. Yes, but she's a minor. She wasn't in any condition to make decisions. And what condition was her father in, hmm? Was he sober when you asked his consent? She was in so much pain. It was the right call to make. I think it might have felt like the right call for you, Doctor. For Ellie, gonna have to wait and see. Our clients are people who are desperate to have children. Ms. Desai is helping a couple realize that dream. But her life is in jeopardy. We... we'd like to understand the arrangement your clients have with our patient. Well, she has graciously allowed our clients' baby to develop in her womb. In turn, they give her a living stipend for every week she nurtures that child. She specifically said she needs the payout. What's that? In the spirit of inspiring a healthy baby, our clients have promised a bonus should Ms. Desai carry to term. That's what she's killing herself for. Ms. Allen, this contract seems to be incentivizing our patient to put her health at risk. Is there any way to alter this? How so? Well, perhaps she would deliver the baby now if she knew she was still eligible for at least a part of that bonus. Unfortunately, our clients have stipulated that they do not wish to adopt a premature baby. It's their baby. According to the law, my clients are under no obligation to adopt this child. Wait. Then who's responsible for this baby? If the bio parents choose not to adopt, Ms. Desai is welcome to keep the child or surrender it to the state. Welcome to keep it? Ms. Allen, this contract seems to protect everyone but Ms. Desai and that baby. I'm sorry, but that is the arrangement she willingly agreed to. If you have any further questions, please feel free to call my office. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Uh... ♪ ♪ This embolism, it happened 'cause of you. She said you were supposed to give him something, but you didn't. I'm telling you, I know your brother. I saw Jimmy Doyle knock him out cold. I'm sure that happened more than once. Andy's too high a risk for blood thinners. You made the wrong call, and now Andy's got this clot in his lungs. You're an uppity b*st*rd, you don't give a rat's ass about us. Back off, Brian. Back off. Hey, I want a doctor who knows what he's doing. You want a new doctor, is that it? Yeah. A good one. Okay. I'm done. ♪ ♪ Noah showed me some selfies he took with Tate's friends. I want to strangle him. [chuckles] Noah or Tate? Noah. He's hooking these ballers up with banana bags. Oh, very enterprising. [sighs] Tate's idea? No, he thought he was doing Noah a favor, giving out his card. Still, what'd I tell you about athletes? Hey, Noah is what he is. It's not Tate's fault. Then what're you mad at him for? I don't know... Oh, God, I'm not. Tate? Uh... how was his check-up? Wasn't too bad. I mean, he cried twice, but... Did not. I'm just playing. Of course not. You're too brave for that. Hey, Eric, you mind if I have a really quick word with your dad? Take a seat for a second right over there, hun. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have made this about you when it wasn't. It's my brother. I really did not like what he was doing at that party. I get you. I really like being with you. [laughs softly] I don't want that to stop. Me either. Look, I was just helping Noah out because, hey, that's your little brother. But I'll let my guys know, no more. Uh, no, that's sweet, but if they want to hire him, they can go right ahead. Noah is making his own way, and I'm done fighting it. Okay. [moving music] Hey, Eric? How about an ice cream sandwich? If it's okay with your dad. I want an ice cream sandwich. Let's get you an ice cream sandwich. Yay. Under flouro we'll get a precise picture of the clot burden, then we can lyse it. Let's get him into the elevator. What's happening? Dr. Perrington is taking him to the cath lab for a clot buster. If you're right about Andrew's head traumas, giving him a clot buster is worse than giving him blood thinners. I gave my medical opinion. The patient and his brother did not want to listen. Perrington's an attending. It's out of my hands now. Rough day? Yeah. I just... What? [sighs] I just... I can't believe what I just did. I have this teenage patient who adamantly refused drugs of any kind because addiction runs in her family, and I just convinced her heroin-addict father to let me give her pain meds anyway. What was I thinking? [sighs] What? Well, I hate to say it, but going against a patient's wishes because you think you know better sounds like something you'd bust my balls for. [groans] What's wrong with this kid anyway? I wish I knew. [phone vibrates, rings] [screaming in the distance] Get away! That's her. [screams] Dr. Manning! Need some help over here. I don't want the spiders on me. It's okay, relax. Ellie, what's happening? Please, get the spiders off of me! Get me five of Haldol. Get them off of me! Page Doctor Charles. Got you. Ellie, there's nothing there. No, no, no! Ellie! Get them off! No, there's nothing there. What's going on? Hey! Shh, shh, shh, shh. Dr. Manning. What's going on? I don't know. [whimpering] Okay, okay. It's okay. It's okay. [sobbing] It's okay. [dramatic music] Acute stomach pain and vomiting, but the endoscopy comes back clean. Then she has a psychotic episode? [sighs] You were right. Never should have given her the narcotic. Although that could not have caused the hallucinations. [sighs] I'm at a loss. I guess this is in your court. Whatever she's suffering from must be psychological. You know, I'm not sure that I agree. When you scoped her, you gave her a benzo or an opiate? Fentanyl. Huh. An opiate. Was it effective? Very. Why? I got a hunch that the stomach pain and the psychotic episode might be related, and if that's the case, whole thing would in fact be entirely physiological. Will you excuse me for a second? Sure. Say, you mind if I ask you a couple personal questions? No. When did you, um, start using drugs? Wow, um... Just so you know, only asking 'cause it might help us figure out what's wrong with Ellie. Near as you can remember, when did you start using? Uh... I'd say high school. And you experiment with various things, or go straight to heroin, or? Oh. Oh. Nat? Yeah. I could use your help with a patient. What is it? I can't get through to her. I thought maybe you could talk to her... as a mother. Dr. Choi. Ms. Desai, we can't delay this delivery any longer. No, please. Ms. Desai, I'm Dr. Manning. I'm sorry you're going through such a rough time right now. I know when my water broke, I was a mess. I wasn't ready to deliver either. I told Dr. Choi, I can't have this baby now. My boys are counting on me to keep a roof over their heads. I understand. I have a son. I would do anything for him, but do you understand what's happening in your body right now? The proteins from your placenta are poisoning your blood, and at any moment you could have an eclamptic seizure that could kill you and this baby. Ms. Desai, your boys would rather spend 100 Chicago winters in a shelter than a lifetime without their mother. Don't orphan them for this money. Neela, look at me. Look at me, Neela. Dr. Choi is gonna take you up to OB, and you are going to deliver this baby. For your boys. [rousing music] ♪ ♪ Okay. [sobs] Call OB, tell them we're on our way. [sobbing] ♪ ♪ [sobbing] Halstead! Why'd you dump us? Dump you? You dumped me, said you wanted another doctor. So? So. Do I look like a doctor? Who cares what I think? You're the smartest guy I know. Listen, I don't know what it is you want, but Andy's in good hands with Dr. Perrington. She knows what she's doing. Hey. What happened to that stand-up kid from high school? What? We respected you. Funny way of showing it. Hey, no matter how many times we knocked you on your ass, you always got back up. Ginger never stayed down. I don't care about this other doctor. I care about my brother. You know him. God sakes, you even remembered the fight with Jimmy Doyle. You said he could get a... A brain bleed? And that could kill him, right? That's right. Then shouldn't you stop this? Oxygen looks good. Let's turn up the propofol. Let's administer the tPA. Wait! What's going on? I want to make sure we're giving Mr. Tucker the proper treatment. He's no longer your patient, Dr. Halstead. He thinks what you're doing could make his brain bleed. Excuse me. Your brother's CT was clean except for old hygromas. That means the risk is very low. I grew up with this patient and seen him take a lot of hits to the head over the years. Those hygromas are indicative of old subdurals. He's at a much higher risk than his CT shows. We need to implant an IVC filter to prevent future clots, but as far as the current clot's concerned, I think we should hold off and let him ride it out. Dr. Halstead is a resident... A doctor in training. I am an attending physician and a Board Certified Critical Care Specialist. I'm telling you, your brother is perfectly able to handle this treatment. He's not. ♪ ♪ We're going with Dr. Halstead, what he says. All right. ♪ ♪ How're you feeling, Ellie? You gave me drugs. I'm sorry, I didn't feel like we had a choice. And what're these? You had what we call a delusional episode. So I'm going crazy? No, we actually think that it might be related to your stomach pain. Did you change your diet at all in anticipation of wearing your prom dress? Yeah, a little. I... I just started eating salads at lunch. Can you remember, your last attack... a year ago... Had you also changed your diet then? I guess, I... I was going to a volleyball tournament in Florida, and I wanted to, you know, wear a bathing suit. Why? We believe you may have a disease called AIP, Acute Intermittent Porphyria. It's a genetic condition that causes severe stomach pain along with episodes of psychosis. Carbohydrates actually help control it, and we think that your latest flare-up was probably helped along by your recent change in diet. That's what's making me feel like this? We think so. Long term, AIP can be treated and managed. In the short term, an opiate will help to ease your pain. An opiate? You don't have to worry. We will carefully manage your dosage. As long as I don't turn out like my dad. Ellie, your father helped lead us to this diagnosis. Again, it's a genetic condition. He probably has it and has very likely been self-medicating all these years. You mean that that's why he's an addict? Well, more like a contributing factor. He probably experienced the same pain that you did when he was your age, and without proper help or diagnosis, came up with his own way to treat it. Baby's in distress. [tense music] ♪ ♪ We've got fetal bradycardia. It's not getting oxygen. Almost there. Baby's apneaic. Suction. ♪ ♪ Come on, come on. ♪ ♪ She looks good. Premature but healthy.

Not as bad as we thought. Maybe we don't need to push the clot busters. You were right. Just glad he's okay. Excuse me. Doctor Halstead. Just curious, you planning on applying for a job here when your residency is complete? First choice. I'm on the hiring committee, and if I were you, I'd be looking for other hospitals. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ What's going on in there? They look like they're celebrating. Yeah. We ran a PBG test on Ellie and confirmed the diagnosis. We also did one on her father, and it turns out he has it too, but he never knew it. All her life she just thought he was an addict who didn't care. Now she sees it was just his way of coping. Any issues? She was born shy of four pounds and her lungs are underdeveloped, but I think two months in the NICU will plump her up and get her breathing properly. That's good to hear. I'm sorry, but I have some unfortunate news. Our clients have pulled out. What? They don't feel equipped to deal with the complications that come with a premature baby. This is a healthy baby. She just needs some extra attention. I understand. You know, my heart goes out to Neela... All she's been through. But I'm not giving up. I'm sure we can find an adventurous couple willing to take on that little bundle of joy. And maybe we can get a little something for Neela too. Of course, you'll get a fee as well.
