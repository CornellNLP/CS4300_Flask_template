 Previously on Faking It... 
 It must have taken you forever to get these. 
 Promise to always wear mine. 
 Don't eat that homophobic sandwich! 
 I'm expecting a text... 
 Begging to get back together. 
 Any minute. 
 Have either of you seen Karma? She knows about me and Liam. 
 Why does it always feel like you're pulling away? 
 Meet me in the courtyard after school. 
 I'll explain everything. 
 You forgive us both, or you hate us both. 
 Then I hate you both! 
 Mom? 
 (Humming) 
 Who died? 
 Darling, whatever do you mean? 
 Whenever something terrible happens, you make French toast and talk like you're in Gone with the Wind. 
 Nobody died, but Karma was here. 
 What did she say? 
 She didn't say much of anything. 
 She just dropped off that box. 
 Please tell me it doesn't have a head in it. 
 You two have more fights than Madison Square Garden. 
 It'll blow over. 
 Oh, what is it? 
 What happened? 
 You know that guy you saw sneak out of my window? 
 Of course. 
 He was Karma's boyfriend. 
 Oh. 
 Well, you can always make a new best friend. 
 No, don't say that. We're gonna get past this. 
 Baby, I'm sorry, but you broke the cardinal rule of the girl code: "Thou shalt not sleep with the best friend's boyfriend". 
 You never taught me that, and Karma and I are more than just best friends. 
 We're soul mates. The normal rules don't apply to us. 
 We're spending the rest of our lives together, as soon as I get her to speak to me. 
 Oh, and I hope you're right. 
 Oh... Oh, oh. 
 Mr. Booker, why do you deserve The Jackson Lee Youth Art fellowship? 
 Well, my girlfriend dumped me. 
 She hates me so much, she metaphorically killed me, and things are unbearable at home since I told everything that my sister is my mother. 
 So I think I deserve to get the hell out of town next semester. 
 Okay, I think the one I wrote for you is better. 
 All that crap about learning and growing? It sounds like bull(bleep). 
 Yeah, well, people who give out fellowships, love bull(bleep). 
 (Phone beeps) 
 Skwerkel alert. 
 "Duke and his new girlfriend spotted at church." 
 Seriously, he's taking her to the House of God? 
 He wouldn't even take me to the House of Pancakes. 
 Sorry, man. 
 It must be hard for you to see him with someone else. 
 Yeah, but not as hard as it would be, if someone sent his Stubbl account to TMZ and outed him as a big fake. 
 You didn't do that, did you? 
 No. 
 No more outing people, remember? 
 Being a good person sucks. 
 Just throw yourself into something else, like I am with this fellowship. 
 Leila, Lisbeth, listen up. 
 I'm running for class president, and you two are my campaign managers. 
 I've been distracted lately from my goal of turning Hester into a school I'd want to go to, but I'm back on track now, and I need 100 signatures to qualify, so chop, chop. 
 Remember when you tried this with Homecoming Queen? 
 It only made everyone hate you more. 
 And you're only social chair because you blackmailed the principal. 
 Now I know how things work around here. 
 I just need some stupid touchy-feely issue to get votes. 
 Then after I win, I'll go back to my true self. 
 So what do I care about? 
 Lately, all you care about is Theo. 
 Cared about, Lisbeth. Past tense. 
 That ass(bleep) is dead to me. 
 He and that slutty bitch Brandi are perfect for each other. 
 That was quite a night, huh? 
 How you doing? 
 Let me go. 
 I will once you tell me where you got this pot brownie. 
 Faking It - 2x10 - "Busted" 
 Don't worry. I forgive you. 
 I feel awful. 
 I know how much you love chocolate chip. 
 Karma, can we please just talk. 
 I'll just have a peanut butter. 
 But Amy's allergic. 
 Good point. 
 Thank you, Irma, for being a true friend. 
 Don't worry. I'm on it. 
 Just need to figure out a plan. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Sorry. 
 8 minutes, 29 seconds. 
 That's how long it takes for me to set up our tent. 
 I've been practicing. 
 Reagan, about camping. 
 Why does your voice sound like that? 
 Like what? 
 Like you're gonna back out of this trip. 
 Am I moving too fast? 
 Camping is one step away from a u-haul. 
 No, and I'm still gonna be there. 
 It's just... I got in a fight with Karma. 
 You two are always getting into fights. 
 Can't this wait until we get back? 
 No, it can't. 
 I need a little bit of time to smooth things over. 
 Please? 
 You have until 6:00. 
 After that, I'm leaving with or without you. 
 It would be an honor to learn from such a talented and prolific Hester alum. 
 I know I would grow as an artist. 
 Don't suck up, kid. I hate bull(bleep). 
 Now, tell me, what were you trying to say with this piece? 
 Well, it's art. 
 It means whatever you think it means. 
 Hello? Is anybody home? 
 You're making your audience do most of the work here, man. 
 What's the point of hammering (bleep) to other (bleep) if it doesn't mean anything? 
 A true artist has intention, so tell me what you are trying to say with this piece. 
 Don't tell me that it represents your journey or some of the bs you think I want to hear. 
 Tell me something real. 
 I don't have intention, okay? 
 I've been through a lot of crap, and making art is the only thing that makes me feel okay for one second. 
 Is that real enough for you? 
 That hit me right here. Right here. 
 Too bad your piece doesn't. 
 Lauren for president. 
 Vote for Lauren. 
 Lauren for president. 
 And that's why I feel so strongly about my campaign platform: Abolishing the grade system. 
 Because how are we supposed to truly learn if we're learning against each other? 
 How do you respond to those who are saying you're just pretending to care about these issues, so you can win? 
 It hurts my heart, but as far as I know, I'm running unopposed. 
 Thanks, guys. Yeah, vote for me. 
 Here, vote for Shane. Vote for me. 
 Hey, ladies. Button? 
 What the (bleep) is this? 
 Inspiring, right? 
 The public beckoned me, and I was hesitant at first. 
 Campaigns really consume your life, but my schedule has cleared up as of late, and I'm ready to eat, sleep, and breathe this election. 
 How are the signatures going, Wen? 
 We're six away. 
 And I just got our first polling data. 
 You have almost Universal Brand Awareness, and your likability is through the roof. 
 People want to be your best friend. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Wendy, stop. You're making me blush. 
 She's the best in the business. Such a get. 
 Speaking of, let's go get those last signatures. 
 Toodles. 
 I have to go where the story is. 
 Take it easy on the free samples, guys. 
 I'm gonna have to start charging soon. 
 Just kidding. 
 I don't understand. 
 If you need to talk to Karma, can't you just say, "Karma, I need to talk to you"? 
 I can't; she hates me, which is why I need your help. 
 Oh, whatever's going on, I don't think she'd want me involved. 
 Mother? 
 Can you please remind this customer that we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone? 
 What happened between you two? 
 (Tires squeal, sirens wail) 
 Are you the proprietors of the Good Karma Juice truck? 
 I have a warrant for your arrest for the sale and distribution of illegal drugs. 
 What? 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything say can and will be used against you you in a court of law... 
 This is gonna get cleared up, right? 
 I mean, you guys aren't drug dealers, are you? 
 Technically, yes. 
 What do you think made the special brownies special? 
 Love? 
 Your mom and I don't view weed as a drug. 
 I mean, to us, it's medicine. 
 And we only provide it to those in need. 
 We sell mostly to nursing homes. 
 Wait, doesn't Phyllis Finnegan's grandson go here? 
 I knew 20 brownies a week was a lot to treat glaucoma. 
 Wait, no, I didn't do anything. 
 Till this is sorted out, everyone who sold goods from the truck is a suspect. 
 That includes you. 
 Hey, let her go. 
 I-I vouch for her. She can stay here with me. 
 Never mind. Take me away. 
 (Engine turns over) 
 You've been lying to us the whole time? 
 I thought we were friends, and friends don't arrest friends' girlfriends. 
 Ex-girlfriends... but, yeah, I knew you were bad news, Theo. 
 Look, guys, it's not personal. 
 That juice truck was a drug front. 
 The Ashcrofts are criminals. Karma might be too. 
 Hey, hey, hey. It's not worth it. 
 You want to end up in jail with the rest of them? 
 Hey, Theo. 
 (Bleep). 
 Oh, that hurts.

 Lauren. 
 I have to say, I saw a lot of amateur art today, and yours was the most amateur. 
 There's something really important I have to do, so could you reject me another time? 
 You got the fellowship. 
 Are you messing with me? 
 I see potential in you. You're angsty and emotional, and you can use it in your art. 
 Fellowship's yours if you still want to spend the semester away. 
 I absolutely still want to get away. 
 Great. 
 So who'd you bribe to get all those signatures? 
 Shane, you're obviously going to beat me in this election, which I'm only doing to stop thinking about my boyfriend, who apparently is a narc, which means our whole relationship was a lie. 
 I'm humiliated and confused. 
 And not in the mood for your crap. 
 Lauren, wait. 
 Would it make you feel any better to know I've been humiliated too? 
 Yeah. 
 Duke and I broke up because he wouldn't come out, and the next day, he's out with his beard. 
 Is that Taffie from Biggest Loser? 
 Yup. 
 If you're gonna date reality, at least go with a winner. 
 Taffie came in third. 
 That poor girl. 
 That poor girl? What about me? 
 You always knew who Duke was. 
 That poor girl has no idea who she's dating. 
 He's been lying to her about everything. 
 Is Duke even his real name? 
 Actually, it's Shannon. 
 She has no idea that he is a big liar and a fake. 
 Taffie deserves to know the truth, and so do I. 
 She's right. 
 Taffie does deserve to know the truth. 
 Karma, I got arrested so we could talk. 
 Just hear me out. 
 Come on, mom, it smells like traitor over here. 
 It's just the toilet. 
 What'd you do to your hand? 
 Punched a cop in the face. 
 Attagirl. 
 Let me see it. My cousin's a doctor. 
 Honey, don't you think you're being a little harsh. 
 "A little harsh"... "A little harsh"? 
 I just think you should give her a chance to explain. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Amy, please explain to me how you could have s*x with my boyfriend. 
 And then lie to my face about it for weeks. 
 Amy, you had s*x with a boy? 
 Focus on the crushing betrayal. 
 You did the one thing you knew I could never forgive. 
 You left me no choice but to hate you, and I hate you for that. 
 Karma, I'm so sorry. I... 
 Okay, you don't have to hate me. It's not as bad as it sounds. 
 Like she's gonna believe anything that comes out of your slutty mouth. 
 No. 
 I want to hear how sleeping with the boyfriend of your best friend in the entire world is not as bad as it sounds. 
 But when you're done, if I'm not convinced, you have to transfer schools, because I never want to see your (bleep) face ever again. 
 You have 60 seconds. 
 You're on. 
 Just to be clear, I'm not interested in Liam. 
 I only slept with him because I wanted to hurt you in the worst way possible. 
 Not a great opening. 
 Hope you're not representing yourself in court. 
 (Sighs) 
 Remember when you saved up all your money to buy that Cinderella dress and you kept it in my room. 
 So that your mom wouldn't see it? 
 Karma. 
 Wow, I'm really screwing this up. 
 My point is, you were always fantasizing about meeting your prince charming. 
 I was happy just to share a cardboard castle with you, and it wasn't until we kissed in the gym that I realized why. 
 I've been in love with you since the day we met, and suddenly we were pretending to be a couple, and there was hand-holding and kissing and threesomes. 
 I started to have hope, hope that you were realizing your prince charming was princess sarcasm. 
 But when that hope died, my heart broke, and I was hurt and angry, and I just wanted to cause you pain. 
 And then I got drunk, and Liam was there like a human sledgehammer. 
 And then I sobered up, and I knew I made the biggest mistake of my life. 
 And I knew that if you found out, this would happen. 
 Not the jail part, the you-hating-me part. 
 Time's up. 
 Screw the time. 
 You said that we can get through anything. 
 Please just give me a chance to earn your trust back. 
 This is it. 
 This is where you decide whether or not I'll be in your life anymore. 
 Wait. 
 That's a big thing you're asking for. 
 I'll need something in return. 
 Of course you do. 
 After this, you're done with the art nonsense. 
 You'll start an internship at Skwerkel instead. 
 Once you get your MBA, you'll take a management position in the company. 
 You may even take over one day. 
 If you back out, you're cut off for good. 
 I can't believe they dropped the charges. 
 Now, this just goes to show you the power of positive thinking. 
 The guard said that someone we know called in a favor to the attorney general. 
 But he's a Republican. 
 We don't know any Republicans. 
 We'll go get the juice truck. 
 You know Liam did this, right? 
 I know. 
 Do you want this back? 
 But I'm not ready to wear it yet. 
 Oh. 
 It's Friday night. 
 Don't you have plans with Reagan? 
 We were gonna go camping. 
 Go. 
 You're more important. 
 I know. 
 But I'll be here when you get back. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 You did well your first case. 
 Now that we know you can handle it, we'll send you to tougher schools. 
 You start Baldwin High on Monday. 
 Gonna find a girlfriend there too? 
 Young lady, I need you to step back. 
 What's your real name? 
 Anthony. 
 How old are you really, Anthony? 
 20. 
 Was any of it real? 
 No. 
 Why did you do this? 
 Why did you make me fall for you? 
 Why me? 
 Lauren, I... 
 No, I opened my heart to you! I don't open my heart to anyone! 
 I trusted you! I told you I was intersex!

 Well, it's about to get crazier. 
 Duke's about to give a press conference. 
 Apparently someone sent a link of his Stubbl account to TMZ. 
 I thought someone was done outing people. 
 I was. 
 But hasn't Theo being a narc taught us you can only hide who you are for so long? 
 Now, let's see him try to lie his way out of this one. 
 Thank you, everyone, for being here today. 
 I'd like to address the recent rumors that have been going around about my sexuality. 
 They're true.
