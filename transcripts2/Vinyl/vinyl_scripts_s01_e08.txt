This f*cking nut,  he does a solo of the "Tiger Rag." I mean, on the tuba. (LAUGHING) Zak :  Who pulls a stunt like that? You know, people think it's easy, but to march and to carry that thing... No, no, no, the physicality, right? I mean, you got to be in shape, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, after high school, what then? Uh, CCA. California College of the Arts. Good school. Oh, yeah... That's a good school. Nice campus. Yeah, you know, it's in Oakland. Oakland. KEWB, channel 91. K.O. Beachin. Great DJ. My son just graduated from there, so he's a legacy. Your son a Grand Funk fan? Uh, yeah. He likes all the bands. We'll set him up with some tickets. And you, your wife. Sounds great. That sounds great. Yeah. So, the loan? Yeah, yeah. This isn't good. Well, I mean, now it's filled out properly, but your account balance is precipitously low. Yeah, no, that's why we need to borrow some money. Yeah, I understand, but the loan-to-value ratio, it skews negatively  and you have, well, no meaningful collateral  and minimal revenue coming in. Our sales figures were up. Yeah, we got a hit climbing the charts right now. "Hocus Pocus." Right, yeah, it's a song by Focus. It's all over the radio. Focus. Maybe my son knows it. I've... Allen, there's nothing you can do? Old times' sake? Wish I could help. I really do. But there's too many imponderables. You really had to stamp it? Yeah. This is a friend? Once a putz, always a putz. I'd like to stick that tuba up his ass. You lose 90 grand of our money up some broad's snatch... You never f*cked up? No, not like that! Really? How about we poll your three ex-wives? Basta, both of you. He feels bad enough. Yeah, and how do you feel? Do you even give a sh1t anymore? f*ck you. Hey! Hey! It's our sixth f*cking bank. We shouldn't even be in this position. What the hell's wrong with you? Either of you guys carrying? Really? What? We're standing on the brink, you're gonna do coke? I need to focus. On what, our impending doom? On straightening sh1t out. I built this company using drugs. When I got sober, that's when everything got f*cked up. That's a convenient interpretation. Drug use, okay. Drug use, not abuse. I need it to focus. Keeps me on top of my game. And besides, Sigmund Freud, Thomas Edison, Sherlock Holmes, they all thrived using cocaine. Sherlock Holmes is not a real person. Give me the f*cking coke! All right, all right! Take it. Take it, it's light. Hey, can I get a ride to 49th? I need privacy. I've got to call Devon. How much of this sh1t are we gonna take? (MUSIC PLAYING) Fine. What? A dick. Two dicks. The map of Italy. And finally, the actual logo for Volkswagen. This is a boomerang. I know a dick when I see one, Hal. Yes, I'm sure you've seen plenty. Excuse me?  I said I'd have them tweaked, okay? What did Richie think of my launch proposal? I didn't give it to him. What? Why? Are you kidding me? Am I smiling? Look, I am trying to stay professional here. Then do professional work. This is a solid proposal. It's gonna be a hell of a party. If you want to change your image, you don't just get a new shirt, honey. We must be an assault on the past. It's like you purposely made a list of every shitty idea. Balloons? Snacks? Cakes in the shape of records? Guess what, Hal. Cakes are already in the shape of records. They do sound, we do picture. And the picture has got to be like nothing anyone has ever seen before. Fashion models, drag queens, midgets. I know it's hard to understand a hip party if you've never been invited to one, but Jesus. I have been doing this job since you were picking out your prom dress! Yes, it's the Peter principle. You've risen to the level of your incompetence. Who the hell do you think you are? I'm done talking about this. Well, I'm not. You're a sweet guy, Hal, which is why you've hung on this long. But with me here, you're a redundancy. (LAUGHS) I think you're confused. I'd only be a true redundancy if I used to f*ck Richie, too. Two weeks' severance with a recommendation. What? Penny, where's Richie? In the studio with the Bits. You think you can actually fire me? Where are we on Veiniacs? You can't fire me. They're in Boston till the weekend. Call their manager. Tell him all new acts are playing the launch party. No exceptions. Richie loves me. Not as much as me. Now clean out your desk before I call security. (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Poor baby Sara ♪

(TAPE REWINDING) What do you think? It's a sea shanty. Makes me want to eat a can of spinach. (IMITATES POPEYE'S LAUGH) It's not that bad. You set the bar high, do you? Lay it down. One take, move on. That's all the songs they got. That's it? I can't even hum that one and half the words were "hey." This is the band gonna lead us into the future? You were never on board with these guys. Keep this sh1t out of here, okay? Sure, let me break out my pom-poms. Hey, Richie. Man, you've had, like, 15 hours on credit, you know? I got Paul Leka and Harry Chapin waiting. Cash in hand. Here's most of it. Lester :  ...see what's chicken scratch and what's a song. That black guy's their manager? What's the story there? Ask him. f*ck do I know? It ain't something to get all worked up about. (BUTTON CLICKS) No food in the studio! (BAND LAUGHS) (SIGHS) They finish here, I'm pulling the plug. Ah. (MUSIC PLAYING) Crack, snap. It should pop. Okay, listen up. You guys are opening for the New York Dolls in less than a month. Do you have any idea how f*cking huge that is? They're not ready, Richie.  Well, then they need to get ready. You know, The Stooges wrote "Real Cool Time," "Not Right," and "Little Doll" all in one day. You need to reach up your asses  and find another song. Well, if you're spending so much time up there, why don't you just take a peek? Good one. Now write me a lyric half as clever as that one with the music to go with it. When I heard your demo, it stopped me in my tracks. It was raw, hard,  it connected me to your world, your experiences, f*cked up as they are. Crime, relationships, drugs, s*x, all the madness of this city. It was like a f*cking soundtrack. Like it or not, you're the face of the new label. And if you don't deliver, there won't be a new label. I don't need a hit, guys. I need a Nasty Bits song. Now. So let me guess, you sang in a choir. I didn't sing until Victor asked me to join Karisma. That thing's not trained? Anyone can sing. Well, well, I work in the record business, yeah, so I'm not so sure of that. Well, everyone should sing. Again, I work in the business. When I close my eyes, belt out a song... (BREATHES DEEPLY) I mean, I know it sounds silly, but there's an energy there.  A connection with the crowd. Yeah. It's like this flow. Electricity or something. This psychic high that courses through my body. We're like this giant organism. Me and them, connected through the music. It's me alone onstage and the audience,  this massive, worshipful entity. I sing and they belong to me. Where'd you come from? (CHUCKLES) Where'd you come from? Massapequa. Gary, Scott Levitt. He's the counsel for American Century Records. How you doing? Absolute pleasure. How are you? Did you bring the contract? What? Yes, I do. Okay, Gary, here's the short of it. I've been in this business longer than you've been alive. (LAUGHS) What I heard at Karen's bat mitzvah, that's the real thing. Gary Giombetta, you're gonna remember that...  that cheese melon thing as the first meal you ate as an American Century artist. My album, would it open like a, you know... Like a gatefold, sure. Yeah. But first we're gonna develop you. Change your name, maybe. Work on the look. I love what you got here. Great stuff. But we're gonna maybe lean into Ziggy a little. Great, yeah. Not a knockoff, but dress for the job you want, right? I am gonna personally oversee the creation, distribution, and promotion of all your work. You wanted one of these? Yes. This is perfect. You want one, too? Oh, sure, why not? For the file. I dreamt of this meeting all night.

(SCOTT LAUGHING) Heather :  American Century. How may I direct your call? I'm sorry, Hannibal is no longer an American Century artist. Yes, I believe he is married. I can't help what journalists ask about. American Century. How may I direct your call? Cece :  You're out of Tanqueray, so I had it restocked. And your meeting with Skip is in an hour. Why isn't there any music playing? Stylus broke. But Casper went out to Colony... Tell them to put the radio on. And find Clark. Devon call? No, but you do have a visit... I left three goddamn messages... There he is! Find Clark. Oh, the Focus song picked up spins, so thank you for that. That ain't why I'm here. I know why you're here. Listen, she needs a little work, but I'm setting her up with Shadow Morton. You know, produced the Shangri-Las, Janis Ian.  Doing a girl group right now. What the f*ck are you talking about? Nora. Your girlfriend. f*ck Nora. What? What do you mean? She's ancient history. I tossed her like a f*cking bowling ball. She had a horrible voice. What, are you f*cking deaf? Hey, cops came to see me. Two dicks from the NYPD. About Buck Rogers. When was this? They know that the three of us were at the Oasis. They talk to you? What? No. No, I mean, somebody dropped off a business card, but that's it. I got them at bay. I lawyered up. I advise you to do the same. But doesn't that make you look guilty? Me? Us, Richie. Us. You f*cking killed him. You smashed his f*cking head in. What are you talking about? They know that you were at Buck's house the night he was f*cking murdered. Yeah, I have an alibi. Good for you. But if I go down, I am not gonna drown by myself. Listen to me, the only reason I was at Buck's was because you demanded that I be there. I saved your f*cking life, now they think I did it. But you did. You killed him. You don't remember smashing his face in? I had to pull you off his back. I was defending myself. Like a f*cking enraged animal. Are you out of your mind? Oh, you don't f*cking knock? I did. I thought you said to come in. Use your head. That's all I'm gonna tell you, Richie. Give it. What do you... Drop the f*cking Eddie Haskell routine and give it up. More. Come on. f*cking more. I'm replenishing tomorrow. Seeing our connection. Jamie introduced me. By the way, I'm still keeping my ears open for bands,  going out every night. I'm leaving.

(MUSIC PLAYING) Skip :  So LaMonte will give us a deal, but it sucks. What? LaMonte, House of Sounds, he'll buy some of our old inventory, but he's lowballing us. Savoy Brown, Lemon Pipers, Status Quo. Plus I'm throwing in some sweeteners to boost the sale. Grand Funk, Slade, Donny Osmond. "Alone Together" is still charting. It's a sweetener, all right? We're lucky to unload this sh1t. Okay, but that kid's one of the only things keeping us in cornflakes right now. Donny's not selling anymore. We got 10,000 copies of his record in mothballs, man. He's old news. What the f*ck are you talking about? I pay you to fudge sales numbers so that they work in our favor. Now that we're out of money, you want to send a top 20 record as a cutout? All I know, you know, is somewhere someone or other is skimming from something. (SCOFFS) The one who smelt it dealt it. What? Right, 'cause I'm a f*cking idiot all of a sudden. Hey, look, man, whatever you're implying... I don't give a f*ck. Truly, I don't. Okay? Whatever scam you got going... dumping albums into the ocean, selling them off a truck,  cutting deals with jobbers to keep your bookies at bay... Where the f*ck do you get the balls, man? My balls? We're literally on the verge of bankruptcy and you're accusing me? We signed him! Done. Whoo! Great, let's have a party. Kid's incredible. What kid? Gary. The kid I told you about from the bat mitzvah. He's a beautiful man. I mean, he's amazing. The kid. Gary is. Does he have a demo? No, we're gonna cut him one. How we paying for this? I'm gonna mortgage the house. That's it. I'm just gonna cover his advance, pay for the studio time. It's gonna keep us afloat. Zak, you can't. f*cking house? Hey, listen. I'm trying to make things right here, okay? The 90 grand, I feel terrible, so... Listen to me. You have a family you have to think about... No, no, no, Richie. Remember that night at the Mercer? You felt something. You had a vision. Okay, this kid, it's the same thing. His voice. He's in a wedding band. Beatles played at a titty bar. You got to trust me on this, Richie, huh? Like I trusted you. Okay, fine. Just check with me before you do anything... (CLATTERING) 
 
 Cece :  Richie! Where is he? (PEOPLE MURMURING) Man :  Whoa, take it easy! Woman :  Hal! Get the f*ck out here, Finestra! Cece : Richie? Hal, my brother, calm down, man. Come on, we're all in the same boat here. The whole company might be going under, you know. The f*ck are you doing? Keep the f*ck away from me! Okay, okay, okay. He's shit-faced, man. Whoa, you're drunk? So what? All the pills you pop, the f*cking downers, and you're gonna judge? Listen to me, Hal. Come on, let's go in the office, okay? So you can sell me some more of your bullshit? You said, Richie, I was okay. I wouldn't be let go. What the f*ck are you talking about? You fired him? That cayenne pepper c**t did! Oh! The Bread albums. Hmm? "On the Waters." That was me. I'm the one made it a hit. I'm sure David Gates would beg to differ. Hey, hey, relax, man! You have any idea how hard I pushed that album? That's why "Make It With You" was a hit, but you don't even understand what I do. Richie, you don't even know anything about me. I understand that you're upset, okay, but this isn't the real Hal. You're right. It's not. You're Jewish? It's a pentagram. Spirits forgive me for what I'm about to do. Oh, God, he's a warlock. It's Satanism. I saw it on David Susskind. Hass and Zorn. Anger reborn.

Rondelay and American Century, you're gonna share office space. (COUGHS) Why? There's a f*cking genius idea. Plenty extra room, right? You're laying people off. Why should he pay rent when youse can split it? This way, he'll be there to look after my investment. We'll keep the names, run the companies individually. All we're sharing is an address.

Those are my brands. Then I quit. For a month. You ever hear of SmokEnders? Oh, God, here we go. It's a seven-week program. They wean you off. You should look into it. Why am I here, guys? Why is he here? I thought you knew. No. What do you think? You got a lawyer, Mr. Finestra? Do I need one? Only if you did something. Did you do something, Mr. Finestra? Like kill Buck Rogers, maybe? No. No, I f*cking told you already that I was with my father. He told you, too. The movies, right? "Enter the Dragon." I loved it myself. He was on the fence. It was okay. Back to Buck Rogers. I want to call my lawyer. So you did do something. No, you're putting words in my mouth now. He wants to talk to his lawyer. Mmm. The phones still down? Phones are still down. So might take a while. (PHONE RINGING) The Knapp Commission? It's cops like you guys, right? (CHUCKLES) Let me guess, you read "The New York Times." Look, whatever you guys think I did, I didn't do it. Well, we think you killed Buck Rogers. But you're saying that somebody else did. So who might that be? I have no idea. Who you trying to protect? Nobody. I just... I respect that, Richie. I do. You're a stand-up guy. You think Joe Corso would do the same for you? What? You think he'd cover your ass? I'm just curious. I don't know, okay? You know where he is right now... Corso? I mean, not literally. Just for example while you're sitting in here. While you're sitting in here, Joe Corso's out on the town. It's Friday night. He's got some whore on his arm, vodka rocks in his hand. And he don't give a f*ck. That much I can promise you. Listen to me, the only reason I was at Buck's was because you demanded that I be there. Joe :  I saved your f*cking life, now they think I did it. Richie :  But you did. You killed him. Joe :  You don't remember smashing his face in? I had to pull you off his back. Richie :  I was defending myself. Joe :  Like a f*cking enraged animal. Richie :  What, are you out of your mind? We picked up an interesting conversation between you and your dad, too. We bugged your office. You had a painting crew in there recently? I want my lawyer. (MUSIC PLAYING) (SHOUTING) ♪ Go around the world with a woman like you ♪
