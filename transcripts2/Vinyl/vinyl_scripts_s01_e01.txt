♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, personal... ♪ Richie's voice :  When I started in this business, rock and roll was defined like this... Two Jews and a guinea recording four schvartzes on a single track. Now it's changed so much, it's not even recognizable as the thing people used to be so afraid of. Now, that's not a judgment. I mean, I always tried to give the audience what they wanted and in return they made me ridiculously stinking f*cking rich. Now, you might want to hate me for that, but before you do, remember this, you jealous prick. I earned my right to be hated. Richie's voice :  I started at the bottom working every club in New York. I mopped floors, swabbed ashtrays, hauled kegs. You think you work hard? Try scraping Chubby Checker's vomit off the inside of a toilet stall. By the time it's the early '60s, I get to start my own record company. Then I built that company into a record label. And then that label ate up other people's labels. Devoured them. I had a golden ear, a silver tongue, and a pair of brass balls. But the problem became my nose and everything I put up it. Add to that a couple of disastrous artists' signings and by 1972 the label was bleeding. f*cking hemorrhaging money. But f*ck it, that's what partners are for. Zak Yankovich, my right-hand man and head of payola. I mean, promotions. Mitch, my man. Oh! Zakovich. How are you, buddy? Hey. Good to see you. You, too. Got a little something for you here. Oh, don't you always? Richie's voice :  Hyman Weiss invented the 100-dollar handshake back in the '50s. But by 1971... I don't know why this is in there. Sorry. ...Zak had raised it to 5,000 and a gram of Bolivian dancing dust. Hello. Richie says hello. So thoughtful. What happened to the girl out front?  The one with that sexy lip. Oh! All right. You know what? f*ck this.  (music stops) Yeah, f*ck it. (music continues) Take care of us now. Always a pleasure. Richie's voice :  What, you thought songs only got played 'cause they're good? Zak. You heard of the wolf in sheep's clothing? Zak goes to the same tailor. Skip Fontaine, head of sales with his magic mustache. I hate that f*cking thing. All those unsold records the stores send back to us for a full f*cking refund, Skip made them disappear. (grunts) Something about the 90-day grace period for receivables, materials lost in transit. Some sh1t like that. Here you go. Point is, suddenly a disaster becomes a profit. (men speaking German) Richie's voice :  But still, it's clear all the book-cooking in the world ain't gonna save the company. Time to dump and run. So this is my story clouded by lost brain cells, self-aggrandizement, and maybe a little bullshit, but how could it not be, this f*cking life? Hey, you know what? Let me just shut up, put the record on for you, drop the needle, and crank up the f*cking volume. Man :  Mr. Finestra. All is in order? Mr. Finestra? Is there a problem with the document? American. I beg your pardon? My company's name is American Century. You dropped the American. PolyGram is an international conglomerate. For us, dropping the word American makes logical sense. (speaks German) The money they're paying, call it Nazi World. Who gives a f*ck? No, yeah. Hey, you're buying it, right? Richie's just a little sentimental, that's all. Well, it was my father's band. American Century? Jazz ensemble. Played horn. Ah, American big band. Does he still play, your father? Perhaps we should sign him to a record deal,  ja? Richie :  He died in the war. Okinawa. Pearl Harbor... despicable. Yeah. Yeah. It was awful. In any event, looks like you are all soon to be very wealthy men. And how is the Led Zeppelin deal coming, hmm? Better than the Hindenburg. (music playing) (men laugh) Our guy in the States, he's closing Zeppelin now. Right now as we speak. It's a done deal. Excellent. In the meantime, Mr. Finestra,  we and our Dutch partners hope you are seriously considering  our offer to join our corporate strategy division in New York. I am definitely mulling it. Man #2 :  A final formality, if you please. Our attorney would like to review the balance sheets one last time. Perhaps next week in New York is convenient, hmm? Yeah, sure. We can do that. No problem. Absolutely. Meine Herren. ♪ Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh... ♪ (German accent) We have ways of making you sign the papers! (all laughing) We are so f*cking close, I can smell it, man. Smell it? It's that German pussy you had last night. You know I hate that f*cking mustache. Let me shave it into a Hitler mustache. Come on, just for when the Krauts come. Come on. Get rid of it. (German accent) Ja, they will elect me the führer, not you. I will be elected the führer, ja? I can't wait. I can't wait. Just to stick it in their Nazi f*cking asses, you know? (normal accent) Yeah, but more lawyers, man. How many f*cking times their lawyer got to look at this? I don't like that, Rich. I don't like that, Richie. It's due diligence. That's all. Diligent Germans. Okay, I'm supposed to sleep better now? I'm a Jew. You tell me Germans are being diligent, we go to the attic and start a f*cking diary. What kind of joke is that? Skip :  What a bummer, man. Too soon. Not too soon. What do you mean? We've been up the air for an hour and a half. Look, just take it easy, okay? Relax. All right? Everything's gonna be fine. I hope so. Before we got to cut a check to Zeppelin. Yeah, not even I could bury a check that big. These classical music guys, they don't understand the rock business, okay? A signed contract with Zeppelin, f*cking catnip. Can't wait. Can't wait. Oh! I'm gonna miss the f*ck out of this plane. It's one of the reasons we're in this f*cking mess. Okay, let's do some coke. Yeah, line it up. Zak :  Let's go. Boom. We're gonna join the Mile High Club tonight. Last night on the plane. I am a card-carrying member. Are you? I'm not. You are. Doesn't seem right to me. Big surprise that, actually, he before you. No, doesn't seem right to me. I got a blowjob on a bus once. That's it. I'm in the Four Foot High Club. (laughs) Woman :  Anton Chekhov. "Uncle Vanya." I don't know... "Cherry Orchard." Okay, what the f*ck are they talking about? Something about her uncle. Ladies, ladies, here. Come, come, come, come, come. Come on, sit down. We were talking about Chekhov. Zak :  The what? Jerk off first, then Chekhov later. Sit down. No, no, Chekhov. You know, "The Seagull." You have to know something, guys. I am a seagull. I have inside of me the spirit of great Alexander, of Napoleon, of Caesar, of all these great people who live inside of me. I am a universal soul. I got a hard-on. (Skip laughs) I got a big crooked hard-on right now. Hey, listen, can I ask you a question? Yeah, sure. Do you speak English? (laughs) You're German, right? No, guys, I'm Russian. Zak :  Russian, okay. That's one dictator over. I'm good. Aren't you gonna play with me? Come on, buddy, take a hit. Come on, take a f*cking hit. I'm good. No, no, no, no, no. Richie's okay. He don't need to do any blow 'cause he already did all of it. That's right. You know what? I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna go in the front. When you're done with these clowns, you come and meet me up there, we'll do a little "Three Sisters." (squeals) You see? You see? He's intelligent. He knows. He knows. You see? Zak :  He does. He knows a lot, Richie. You see? Yes, I do. Here, what about you? What about me? Tell it to me. Of course I believe. No, I want to hear. I want to hear. Say "I believe in Chekhov." Zak :  I'm a jack... I believe in Chekhov. You're scaring me and I f*cking love it. ♪ Because this life I lead ♪

He used us for leverage. PolyGram is gonna be here on Thursday. Yeah, we're totally f*cking f*cked. f*ck! I'm not telling him. There's more. Uh, Buck Rogers, Ellerbee Broadcasting. Announcer :  For his distinguished service to the radio community. The radio guy. Richie :  I know who the f*ck he is. I know you do. Yeah, well, apparently Donny Osmond stiffed him on some promotion thing. He's threatening not to play the new album. Fine, I guess I'll go talk to him. He's talking a boycott, label-wide. Over Donny f*cking Osmond? He's a f*cking maniac. You know that guy. He thinks we favor his competitors now and... Look, I want to bring in Joe Corso. Corso's a thug. You don't know that. You don't know that. He's good. He's good at what he does. You shouldn't say things about people that you don't know. You know, he's... he's the best promotion man in the business. 14 radio stations across every major market not willing to play any of our albums. It'll spread like f*cking leukemia. It's no joke, Richie. We're gonna be bankrupt in a month. Fine, bring in Corso. Meantime, PolyGram is watching us, so buy us some charts. Paper ads on "Cash Box." A single on Billboard's top 20 if you can. And you, I don't care if you've got to ship  crates of Captain Beefheart's catalog to an empty f*cking warehouse in Poughkeepsie, inflate the f*ck out of the sales numbers. Meanwhile, I'll go lean on f*cking A&R. What about me? You? You go to the emergency room. Oh, my God. For what? See if they can get your head out of your f*cking ass. No, yeah, that's a good plan. Some of these are okay still. Let's pick these up, give them to the assistants. The sesames landed face up. Julie : Who knew Vikings could sing?  (laughter) These are the original white people, folks. Hey, is this Swedish? Look at you, little Miss Woman of the World. Whoever knew you went north of Queens Boulevard, right? We can't all be jet-setters. Who had the turkey provolone? Oh, Clark, how was that trip to the Norwegian s*x change clinic you went to? Pow! Right in the kisser. Wow, okay. The roast beef is mine. Let me get some of the Thai stick you're holding, all right? f*cking barkeep at Small's shooting me down Wallbangers all f*cking night. Oh, good. Marvin has a hangover. Least I know one of you has been doing your homework on a school night. Julie :  Hey, Rich. I left that Aerosmith bootleg with Cece. Mm-hmm. What is this? I think it's a Swedish girl group. They just charted in Europe. We passed on 'em months ago. Atlantic UK just signed them. ABBA. Music's garbage, but I'd f*ck the blonde. Would the blonde f*ck you? That's what we want to know. Can you beg in Swedish? Oi! Oi! Is that... Clark :  What was Atlantic thinking? This is crazy. Jamie :  But it's catchy, right? You can dance to it. Hey, don't you have letters to type? Just saying. Marvin :  This is Alvin and the Chipmunks, baby. Please make this sh1t stop, man. I'm throbbing right now. You don't like Alvin and the Chipmunks? (music stops) You're all hearing this the same way? Yeah. No. Of course. Three bars. Three bars, I can tell they'll be filling football stadiums. Come on, Richie. Where are we with the Good Rats? Eventually you're gonna have to swallow. And when you do, I want to hear some good news. Oh... okay. They... (coughs) They went with Warners. And you're here eating lunch? He needs sustenance, doesn't he? What he needs is to sign the next Good Rats like I'm f*cking paying him to. You're completely right. I will go. I will... Sit down. Eat your f*cking liverwurst or whatever it is. Anybody? Anything? Come on, people! Our goddamn roster is like a Chinese menu. It's all over the f*cking place. Grand Funk and Donny Osmond, Savoy Brown, f*cking Robert Goulet. Who's next, huh? Topo Gigio? Is he in play? The guy who does the voice, I mean. Look, Richie, I've been going all around the city. There's nothing good out there.  Then get out of the city. Ahmet Ertegun walked through a f*cking swamp to sign... Professor Longhair, yeah, we all know that story. You're a wiseass now? No, no, no. Just, I hear you, man. Oh, you hear me? Yeah. You hear me? Because I hear nothing. You know what they call this label out there in the world? American Cemetery. Where artists go to die. Maybe we could get hipper offices. Move out of the Brill Building. I like it here, asshole. Bars, dance clubs, f*cking high school talent shows. Wherever people sing. Public restrooms, boss. That's honestly the place I've been lately. Groups go in there to rehearse for the harmonies. There you go. They go in there and they're singing all the time. Nine months. Nine months I sat in the dark to sign Jose Feliciano. Okay? He's blind. He doesn't need lamps. I want what's next! Richie, I have something. The Nasty Bits. I mean, they're raw, but I think they're pretty good. Nasty Bits. Richie, it's four chimps with Telecasters. You lost speaking privileges. They're playing the Coventry tonight. I'm gonna go check them out. Where'd you find them? I saw the singer on the subway and I liked his look. That's what I'm talking about. From the f*cking sandwich girl. Gold star for Jamie. That's right. That's right, skinny. You know what? Since you're such a f*cking stud, you can get on a plane right now, go to LA... Coach... and deliver a check to David Geffen. I was supposed to cover the session with England Dan & John Ford Coley. No, no, no. You were supposed to sign the Good Rats. I don't have a f*cking thing to add to that. Hey, thanks for the sandwich. Of course. (music playing) ♪ Mama ♪

Technically, yes. But in reality, they only look like flops. Please, explain. Our artists aren't tuxedo-clad maestros  with degrees in music theory. We got credibility in the business. No Leonard Bernsteins. No Herbert von Karajans. We're talking about pop singers here. You like the tea? Richie :  Generally speaking, not your most sophisticated individuals. On one side, you've got us, the record execs. On the other side are the artists' lawyers who all want to be record execs, so they don't want to piss us off too much by being too good at their job. No offense. Next, you have the contract itself. Now, assume an artist gets paid a dollar for every record sold, less recoupable expenses. So, sell a million records, that's a million bucks. Not bad, right? But there's that word... Recoupable. First gold record. First gold record. Richie :  That means that no matter how many records they sell, the actual cost of producing that record  always comes out of the artist's end. Physically manufacturing the record,  touring costs, studio space, marketing, packaging. If a drummer drinks a Pepsi in the middle of recording that album, believe me, he's paying for it at a 700% markup. We really don't have any downside. No, no, we practically break even on all the flops. But the hits, that's where we cash in big. But your biggest hit maker would have been the Led Zeppelins, no? Richie :  Maybe. Maybe. But I got to tell you... (sighs) I can't do business with them. Their manager, Peter Grant, well, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he hates Germans. I mean, the man is a serious racist. It's true. I've never seen anything like it. I mean... they almost made my stomach turn. Horrible. I don't like when we talk about competitors like this because that's not the way we do business. But let me just say, you're Germans, we're Americans, but we're people. We're people. But this man... We're all... ... that man is hate. That's all he is. Right, and no one knows more about hate than you. I mean, not you specifically. You know, just persons like you. Zak :  We've learned. We've learned.
