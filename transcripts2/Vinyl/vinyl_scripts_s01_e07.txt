 (distant) Richie. Richie. You want me to get rid of all of this? Yeah. Marvin :  sh1t, maybe boss is on the wagon. It look like Christmas up in here. Come on. Hey, guys, which one? The Allmans. Skip :  Spare me the Russian novel. We'll live. Scott :  What if we put a moratorium on appetizers or set some parameters? Zak :  No, the bleeding stops now. Skip :  Your Diners Club card, let's go. Ante up, boss. No one's exempt. What are you telling me? It was my idea. All right, take it easy. Scott :  Richie, artists,  program directors expect some... some wining and dining. Guys, the job is still the job. Okay, except now we submit receipts which will be vetted. So, before Julie sends a third bottle of Dom to Jose f*cking Feliciano, you ask yourself if you'd be okay paying out of pocket. Act British, spend Yiddish. Good news is, thanks to some difficult cuts, payroll's down to 33,000 a month, which we're still not gonna make. Uh, no, wait. No, definitely won't. f*ck! Losing Hannibal f*cked us. Put down your pearls, for Christ's sake. Hey, we're about to turn a corner. That's exactly what the Nazis told my Uncle Isaac. Showers right around the corner. f*ck Hannibal. He's next year's Stan Free. We're running lean, guys, hungry. That's what we want to be. Mission accomplished. Okay, let's figure out how to pay our serfs. Richie's apartment. Now he's got a f*cking abacus. Okay, first of all, it's a company apartment. That's funny. I never get to stay there. I'm out six nights a week, all hours. How much is it? 1,100 a month. If that breaks us, we deserve to break. The plane. Lou Meshejian. Skip : Newville Records? Yeah, wants to buy. 470,000. He assumes the payments on the loan, we net 90 grand. That's three months' payroll. Yep, just about. Cash, too. What's the catch? Got to be now. As in? As in today. Skip :  How long have you known about this? He's looking at other options. At least there's no rush. Okay, great, listen, I'll draw up a contract. Don't want to be liable if the plane crashes or blows up. What the f*ck you saying? What is wrong with you? All right, relax. Just draw up a simple bill of sale, okay? Jesus Christ. I'll go, make the deal face to face. You're gonna go? What, you got nothing better to do around here? Lou knows me. If he balks, I can close him. Oh, yeah. Look, I want to clear my head. Is that okay? Six-hour plane ride. No phone calls. You can't live without me for a day? I'm... (knocks) Yikes, did I miss anything? How could you miss anything at a partners meeting? Aw, Skip. What's the buy-in? I'll go get my change purse. (laughs) Focus is playing Wollman next week. Yodeling fans rejoice. Their "Hocus Pocus" is hanging by bloody fingernails to just south of 40. That's pretty good for us. Get a pop on it. Let me write that down. "Get a pop on it." (laughing) Who still talks like that? Scott :  This f*cking guy. Somebody drank their Tang this morning. Can I sic Corso on ABC? Use somebody else. Corso's on another thing. What? We don't got bread to spread around. Corso's perfect. He goes in, he does the Magilla Gorilla thing. It's top 40, done. You know what? Fine. Whatever. So let it be written, so let it be done. As you were, gentlemen. Hey, the whole gorilla thing, that just stays with us, right? I'll make a note of it on the way to pick up your panty shields. Oh! She's a regular Phyllis Diller, that one. I'm coming with you. You hate LA. I hate everywhere. Scott :  Where's breakfast? Where the f*ck is Clark with the donuts? Or did we cut those, too? Skip :  Wouldn't surprise me.

Zak :  Pretend I'm a pole. See what happens. Vivian :  Like that? Zak :  You're Vivian, right? It's supposed to be a party, right? Vivian :  How could you forget? Zak :  Yes. I knew that. Don't say anything. You're my favorite. Vivian :  Oh, you promise? Zak :  Of the two of you, you're first. Yeah, she's close. Richie. Wonder where the peasants are, huh? They're not here. Girls, hold on. You guys are friends, aren't you? Come on. That's not how you treat your friend. All alone here. You're friends, right? Come on. No, you're better friends than that. Aren't you better friends than that? (women laugh) Whoo! Jackpot. We're all friends tonight. I never doubted your existence. Ever. I know. I know. ♪ Who's that lady? ♪ 
♪ Real, real fine lady ♪ 
♪ Who's that lady? ♪ 
♪ I would love to take her home ♪ 
♪ But her heart is made of stone ♪ 
♪ Got to keep on keeping on ♪ 
♪ If I don't, she'll do me wrong... ♪ Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. God, if you made better tits than these right here,  you're leaving them all to yourself. I'm gonna go get some more Dom. All right, Richie. We're gonna... go. Get in there. All right, come here, you. (squeals) Okay, and away we go. Save some for me. Zak :  Look out. (laughing) Zak :  Uh-oh, sorry. You all right? Patty :  I'm okay. Zak :  Whoo! (Patty laughs) (music playing) Elvis :  That one's real, man. Are you a narc? (laughs) No, but it is serious, the drugs thing. Yeah, no doubt. A scourge. I... I don't know where the colonel is. He told me to come up after the show. Huh. You loved it. I did. We get to cooking up there, man, look out. You leave it all on the stage. That's showmanship. Breaking up instruments, lighting things on fire. Man, I don't know. Noise. I just... I just want people to... I want them to feel the music, you know? I... I want them to live in the music. That's where I live, in the music, man. Nobody sh1ts out a meat ass can do what you do, Elvis. (chuckles) Come on. Yeah, I don't truck with the business end of it too much. I'm about actualization, you know, of the self. What... you don't by any chance dig Abraham Maslow? You kidding? "Hierarchy of Needs." Out of sight! Listen, look, I'm not gonna try to sell you on anything because what you have sells itself. You... you don't belong here. Look, "Aloha from Hawaii" was watched by half the planet. You got enough money to eat? Yeah, we're doing okay. No, you're not. Okay, you're gonna die a rich man 50 years from now. But are you gonna die king? You had 20 people onstage with you tonight. You, Scotty, D.J., Bill. That's the band. Yeah, we made a racket, boy. That '68 special, that wasn't a comeback. That was you. Had to sit through half of it. Guitar strap came off. We were going for it, though. Goddamn right. Hey, I've got a band, the Nasty Bits. Three guitars, backbeat like a jackhammer. They're raw, okay? Everything these kids are doing now is because of what you did. (chuckles) So let's get you and a gut bucket band together and then show people how rock and roll is supposed to make you feel. You got some cats want to play with an old boy like me? Where's your phone? Where's your phone? Hey, we get you guys down to Muscle Shoals, a washboard, a snare. Yeah. Yeah, old Bill Black, man, he used to get a hold of that bass, that dog house, get on that one string, boy, he'd lay on it. (imitating bass) There it is. Man. (chuckles) I don't know, man. RCA, they want me to do two Christmas records this year. Hey, listen to me. Christmas is where artists bury their careers. You know John Simon? Produced Janis. The Band. ♪ Take a load off, Fanny ♪ 
♪ Take a load for free ♪ ♪ Take a load off, Fanny... ♪ That's it. (chuckles) Yeah. Man, look at this. Kissing them old ladies, I got a sore. You don't kiss the King. Right. You don't touch the King. Right. It's part of being the King. (sighs) Man, what about my spirituals? Spirit... okay. Hand to God. Ask my wife. I want "Crying in the Chapel" playing at my funeral. A whole album. From the field stuff. You need Sweet Inspirations, man. Yeah, bring them. (snaps fingers) Pops Staples producing. You get it. Man, you get it. You... you get it, man. I wanted to do Woodstock. There'll be others. Hey, American Century is gonna be the kingdom of rock and roll. You on the throne. Man, I can't wait to see old Kenny Glancy's face. You won't have to. My lawyer Scott, he's a junkyard dog, man. We can get this done by the morning. I'll have him draw up the contracts. We'll notify RCA. (door opens, slams) A little late for entertaining, ain't it? Colonel, I... Why don't you tell the colonel what you told me, Richie? Elvis and you deserve to be at a place where you're respected, where your legacy will be protected. I spend sun to sun ensuring that. The problem is RCA. I don't belong here, Colonel. The capes, the old ladies. I can still fit in that jacket. You remember that jacket. The one I wore for the special. I was the devil in that jacket. Well... we haven't made up our minds on anything yet. Usually Elvis likes to stay out of the paper pushing. I'm gonna go call Scotty and them right now. If you'd just listen to what Elvis and I have to say, I think you'll... Elvis. Why don't you show Richie that move? The one you taught Nixon's Secret Service fellas. Now you got it. What move? Whoa! Hey, man, here. Point her at me. Is this thing even loaded? Whoa! Ah! Ah! (grunts) You see that? That's using an opponent's motion against them. It's called chi. Praying mantis style. Colonel :  El, why don't you get some sleep? Big show tomorrow. One must be like water. One must be like water. Son... see yourself out. (music playing) (TV playing) Oh! Get up. (groans) (snorts) f*ck happened here? Uh... Oh. Oh. (groans) What happened? I just asked you that. (groans) Is... where are they? Where'd the girls go? They did this? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. What? No! What? No! You m*therf*cker. Richie, Richie, they robbed us. You m*therf*cker. I will f*cking... They robbed us! Get the guy! Get the f*cking... What? Get the hotel dick up here. And tell them what? That you had a three-way that went south and you got robbed? We're in Vegas. This whole f*cking town is corrupt. Those girls were probably pros. They'll have us arrested. Get your f*cking hand... I f*cked us. I... I f*cked us. I f*cked us. I f*cked us. f*ck! (breathing heavily) (grunts) (groans) (groans) I want to die. I want to... I want to die, Richie. Oh, f*ck. (sniffling) Everyone f*cks up, okay? I mean, sh1t... we'll make it back, okay? (crying) sh1t. Not like you lost 10 million, right? Hey. That's why they call it rock and roll, right? Come on. One leg at a time. Come on. Like the rest of us. Okay, buddy. The other one. Yeah, that's it. I got you. I got you. Take it easy. f*ck, stay back. I got you. I got you. It's okay. (baby crying) Woman :  It's okay. Shh. Honey, okay. Would you like a beverage? Gin and tonic. Sure. (toilet flushes) Thank you. Sure. (crying) You're okay. Shh. Attendant :  Would you like a beverage? All right, doll. You... I just want to... You really looked after me last night.
