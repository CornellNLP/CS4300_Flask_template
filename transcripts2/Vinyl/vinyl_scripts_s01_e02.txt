 (scratching, squeaking) Man on screen :  You must attend the morning ritual in uniform. Outside. (breathing heavily) (shouting) Hiyah! Yah! (grunting) Man :  Sit down, man. Gentlemen... Richie :  Gentlemen. ...it seems that one of you was not content last night  with the hospitality of the palace and sought diversion elsewhere. (snorts) Fucking-A right I did. Man :  Would you shut up?! You shut up. (man #2 shouting indistinctly) Man on screen :  ...worthy to remain among us. (shouting) Usher :  Hey, hey. The f*ck you doing? Watching the movie. This ain't a hotel. You've been here all goddamn day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shh, shh. Hey, you're disturbing the other patrons. Teacher. Teacher. I see your talents have gone beyond the mere physical level. Your skills are now at the point of spiritual insight. You hear that? You f*cking hear that? Listen, pal, sit down and shut your trap or go back to the f*cking shelter. Hey, I'm no bum, mister. Oh, yeah? Then who the f*ck are you? Zak :  I think it was '68 or...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was '68. Scott :  Was it? Yeah. It's me, Daltrey, Keith Moon, and the manager. Townshend, he's already at the arena  doing the sound check. And we get in the car, we start heading out and Moon says, "Hey, stop, stop. I forgot something." He runs back in the hotel. Five seconds later, a TV set comes crashing down to the pavement. (laughing) He jumps back in the car. He says, "Well, Jesus, that was close. It nearly slipped my mind." (laughing) He said... Only in rock and roll. Where the hell is this guy, right? That's our Richie. Loves to make an entrance. Oh, you seeing any shows while you're here, huh? A little Broadway? We took the wives to the opera. Ja. "Dir Fledermaus" at the Met. "Grease" is good. You might like that. You know what? "Pippin," that's another one with... oh, what the hell is his name? The black guy. Ben Vereen. That's not it. No answer at the apartment or on the car phone. The house number has been busy for an hour. Hmm. Richie's stuck in traffic. Oh, that guy. I knew it. He's gonna be here shortly. Oh, my apologies. I'm gonna hit the head. There's more coffee, croissants if you want. Yeah. Yeah. Soon. The black guy in "Pippin." What's his name? I'm sorry, I don't know. Because she's black she knows who's in "Pippin"? (phone ringing) (music playing) (ringing continues) (children shouting) Devon :  Hello? Dev, hey. Zak. How you doing, hon? Did Richie ask you to call? What? No. No. He's not there? No. Okay. Okay. Uh, everything all right? He went on a bender. What do you mean? When? Last night. What? Coke, booze, what? He drank half a quart of whiskey and trashed the f*cking den. Did he hit you? No, of course not. Why would you even ask me that? You seem upset. I don't know, I just thought... well, when's the last time that you saw him? 9:30, 10:00 last night. He just drove off. Well, I'm sure he's fine. Yeah, of course he's fine. He's always fine. It's everyone around him gets f*cked. Can you make me Lucky Charms? Oh, no, come on. Let's go out. How about pancakes, yeah? Hello, hello. What's going on, my man? What's going on here, brother? You know. Chicago's number one again? Who the hell's buying this sh1t? (elevator bell dings) ♪ Oh, Jean Genie lives on his back... ♪ Heather :  Richie, what happened to you? Morning. Love that blouse. You okay, boss? Fit as a fiddle, ready for love. Oh, my God. They in there? Yeah, but... Coffee, please. Wait, make it a Sanka. Zak :  John Denver, he's another one. His real name... Deutschendorf. Oh, yeah, a lot of Germans. Hey, here he is. Finally. Yeah. f*ck happened to you? Were you mugged? Yes. By God. But I took his wallet instead. (laughs) Mr. Finestra, you are bleeding. We're all bleeding on the inside. All right, then. Terrific. We got the contracts right here. You hear what I just said? I did. I did. That's very thought-provoking. What do you say later we'll have a rap session? You don't get it, man. That building fell down and I walked away. What building? The Mercer? It's been all over the news. I was there, man. This is true? I'll tell you what. Our guests, they've been here for quite a while. So why don't we just sign the contracts? It's gonna take you five seconds. Then we're gonna get you cleaned up. I'm not signing anything. Legally it's fine, Richie. Here we go, right here. You know what? One of these days I'm gonna grab you by those muttonchops and I'm gonna turn your head like a f*cking steering wheel. We're not selling the company. Richie. We have a binding verbal agreement. Yes! Yes, we do. And the party of the third part is ipso facto e pluribus unum. This is outrageous! Unum, M*therf*ckers. Unum. That's Latin. What are you doing? What are you doing? I just f*cking got here. This is nothing. This is nothing. This is all personal. I got some champagne. Have some mimosas. It's gonna be two minutes. What are you doing? Zak! Zak! He's coming. He's coming. Right here. Right here. Last night I saw the Dolls. The music, man. The crowd. It was electric. Everything's good. Keep doing... it's good, it's good, it's good.

♪ Breathless. ♪ Relax. Relax. (breathing heavily) (murmuring) Okay. Okay, Richie. What the f*ck's going on? I had a vision. A sign. Call it what you want. An epiphany. New York Dolls are a band, Richie, not an epiphany. It's a band we passed on over a year ago. I'm not talking about the Dolls, per se. Rock and roll. That f*cking energy, man. Forget Yes, f*cking Emerson Lake and Palmer. Rock and roll, man. Like the first time you heard it. It's fast, it's dirty, it smashes you over the head. You've already been smashed over the head. That's the problem here. My skills... my skills, they've transcended into the spiritual level, man. You don't understand. Okay, here's what I do understand, Richie. I understand you're high. I am. I was. So what? So what? You want to go down that road again? I saw the future. The future of this company. I f*cking heard it. We made a deal with these people, Richie. This is an agreement negotiated in good faith to sell. Shut up, Scott. Just stop f*cking talking. Hey, I am a junior partner here. Guys, we started this company, the three of us, from nothing. Right, and now we're selling it.  No, we're not. I made commitments, Richie. Financial commitments with serious ramifications for my whole family. I'm talking about our dreams and you're worried about your mortgage? Yes, I am. I am because Chase Manhattan  doesn't give a f*ck about dreams. Well, I do, okay? Since when? Since last night? Huh? Since you Hoovered a gram of coke up your nose? You're a selfish prick, you know that? And you're a hack. Go sell Buicks or aluminum siding. What's the f*cking difference? Zak, we'll cut costs. We'll tighten our belts. It'll be okay. Richie, this deal, it's not just about you, okay? You tank this, you f*ck all of us. You understand me? Please, just sign the thing. Let us cash out on this albatross and then go. Go do whatever the f*ck you want. Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap! That's you, man. You talk, I do. Okay, all right, listen to me, f*ck head. Oh, f*ck head? Oh, listen to him. Listen to him! Listen to him! You're gonna go sign the contract and then go home to your wife. What's my wife got to do with it? I talked to her before, okay? She's worried sick about you. Go home. You called Devon? Okay, get your hand off me. Hey, Richie. Or what? Or what? I said f*cking stop it. Why, what are you gonna do about it? (shouts) m*therf*cker! (screams) Scott :  Motherfucking ass... You m*therf*cker. You fucker! (shouts) ♪ Etty in the room a cry ♪

So... so... so is there anything that I should know? About what? What... what was that? Oh, that? (shouts) Just me exercising my rights as principal shareholder. Oh, okay. So... so... so we're not selling the company? Was that not clear? No. Oh, yeah, yeah. No problems. It was very clear. So we're doing this again? Yep. (snorts) Hey-oh! (laughs) Huh? Oh, no, no, no.

And I'm a little bit biased. She and Nico did a play together downtown. Can you introduce me to Andy? Griffith? Yeah. I mean, if Barney Fife isn't available. You know, this whole show is Andy's idea.

We'll be trimming our roster. And less artists means less need to kiss the asses of those artists. So 40% of our support staff will be let go. That's right. What about us? Who us? A&R. You're all fired, effective immediately. But the good news is you have two weeks to earn your jobs back. Bring me a solo artist or a band that this label can market. I want new, fresh, fast, exciting. In two weeks? I mean, like, how can you put a time frame on talent? You're right, Mitch. You can go. What? Get out. You're fired. Richie, I was just... Whoa!

Will you remember it tomorrow? Does it make you want to call the radio station and find out who the band they just played was? Think back.

That band, I gave you their tape. The Nasty Bits. Right. What did you think? There's something there. Really? Mix was for sh1t. They got some balls in their sound. MC5ish. Wow. Far out. So what's the next step? Have someone from A&R check them out. I was hoping that could be me. You're a secretary. And you're a girl. I found these guys. I brought them to you. You snatched a tape before it got to my in-box, sweetie. Would you have listened to it if it had gotten there? Probably not. So don't I get points for initiative? Fellatio Alger. You want me to suck your dick? Well, I'd be lying if I said the thought hadn't crossed my mind, but no. Then how the f*ck do I get ahead? Work with Julie. Get the band ready. Set up a showcase sometime next week. How many songs? Talk to Julie. Thank you, Richie. Thank you. I promise you won't be sorry. There is one thing you can do for me.

For what? (mock British accent) To play it for Richie Finestra. (regular accent) You'll do that plus two originals. Do the bloody Kinks? Why that song? Because the vocals are in a range he can handle and it's got a chord structure a monkey could play. F-G, G-F, F-B-flat, G. (sighs) I mean, The Kinks are all right, but that's just not who we are. No sh1t. But who you are ain't getting signed. f*ck. So what do you think? Man :  I don't know, man. Man #2 :  Come on, man, who are you kidding? Do it. Just do it. All right, fine. (breathing loudly) You all right? I can't breathe through my nose. Well, prop up a pillow or something. This idiot who rear-ended you, did he have insurance? Yeah, he did. We exchanged information, so... Was he a colored? What? No. Why? 'Cause most of them are uninsured. He was white. He was... I don't know. He had a German-sounding name. And the doctor bill, he'll take care of that? I mean, it's got to be a pretty penny. I went to Merv's, honey. (groans) He's not gonna charge me. Wonderful. Now I can hear from your sister all through Rosh Hashanah what a prince her husband is. Okay, and then if he would have charged me, you'd be complaining about that. Who's complaining? (scoffs) I mean, you do realize the rates will go up, right? With the insurance. What? The car. Doesn't matter if he hit you. They'll raise the rates just the same. Okay, all right. I'll call the broker in the morning. What's he gonna do? The broker doesn't make the rules. Then I won't call him. (groans) What do you want me to say? Who asked you to say anything? (sighs) (passing car radio playing) You're peeing again? I can't sleep. Well, don't make a racket. David's playing Nathan Detroit in the camp sing-along tomorrow. I swear...

Ingrid : She can't. Devon : Aw! Why? The baby. You know why. She's right. I'll get you a drink. Oh, Dubonnet if we're not out. Yeah. (laughs) Ernst : You will move somewhere with rolling hills and ponds. What do you need a pond for? So the child may fish. (laughs) Yeah. Yeah, listen to me, Ernst. I didn't fish. My kid's not gonna fish. Devon :  I fish. You're sh1tting me. What do you think one does growing up in rural Virginia? I don't know, I just figured you went to, like, cotillions or something. You are not going back to Virginia. Oh. I'll die here without you. What? I don't know. It's just now when I walk down the street, I feel like I'm gonna get stabbed or something. Richie :  Dev. I know it's irrational. Ernst :  It is not irrational. The city is a hostile environment. I can see it makes you feel vulnerable. Before, you were invincible. Stop speaking. If you're worried about it, we can move to the Upper East Side. You hate it up there. Long Island, Westchester. He's right. We should get a house with a f*cking pond. (laughs) And fish. What about her work? It's not Mars. I mean, I can take the train in for auditions. That's it. I'm gonna get you the biggest f*cking house with a pond in America. (laughing) Huh? Look what you've done. I'm gonna bake bread. I'm gonna braid my armpit hair. You're turning me on. Give me a hit of that armpit. (laughing) Come on. No...
