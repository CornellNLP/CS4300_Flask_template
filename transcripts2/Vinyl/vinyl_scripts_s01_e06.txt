We should consider bathing at some point. This is why Warhol told her not to marry you. He knew it would come to this. f*ck that f*cking freak. What day is it today? It's, uh... I mean, it's like forever, right? Like days. She's your wife, but she's a spoiled little bitch. Right?! Leaving me here with the house and the kids. Who gives a sh1t? Let's party. You think she's with Ingrid? Yeah, she is. I f*cking know she is. Our maid said that she said that she was with a friend in New York. I mean, who else could it be, right? They could be rubbing their pussies together. (laughs) Drink. Devon prefers dick, believe me. Then a man. Perhaps a nigger. My mother was half black, okay? The other children would tease you? I should freeze my accounts. You should f*ck. The little blonde from the office. Uh-uh. Or the receptionist. Why haven't you poked her yet? It's your turn now. You're free. Right, man. Right, man. f*ck Devon, right? Yeah. (both laughing) Richie :  Whoo! Come in, it's open. Mr. Richie, we are going now for lunch at the park. Yeah, fine, fine, fine, fine. Put some clothes out for me. I'm going to the office. (gasps) Why? How my babies doing, huh? Come here, come here, come here, come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, you know you're my perfect girl. You know that. Who's Daddy's angel? You? You're my angel. And where's that handsome prince, huh? (gasps) There he is! There's the Romeo. Come on, my little Romeo. Come here. Come here. Give me a hug. I love you guys so much. Could they be any more beautiful, these two? I do not see how. Okay, okay, we let Daddy work now, sí? Come on.  Vamos. Come on, baby. Come with me. Daddy's gonna be right here, okay? Daddy's got to work. (Jenna speaks Spanish) (Estella speaks Spanish) (Jenna speaks Spanish) You hear that sh1t, man? f*cking  leche? Do they think that's their mother, man? That is not cool. She cannot do that to my kids. You should find her. Drag her back by the hair if you have to. (music playing) (phone rings) Chelsea Hotel. How can I help you? Look at this. He tore it. You were pulling off my skin. Where is she? We need to start over before we lose the whole day. I'm here. I've got it. I've got it. He's not going to do it again. He has to. It should be a woman anyway. I told you that. The piece is already sold. He's expecting what we discussed. Since when do you give a sh1t about the patron? It's a dialog with George Segal. If I don't evolve the conversation... A woman halts the evolution of the art form? Then she's the subject of the piece. Is that the worst thing in the world? Once. Fine, you sit in. I almost passed out the last time you put me in that sh1t. If you breathe slowly... Stop it. Get a man from the lobby. Make it another Paul Bezak piece about men and men and men. (distant siren wailing) You sure it's okay? Feels like old times. Give me a minute to work with her. You handed me the cream. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's give him some space, everybody. (chatter) Move down a foot. Turn away. She seems happy. Ingrid? She isn't. Why? She wants to be conventional in an unconventional paradigm. You think she wants to marry you? That's one way to look at it. She says you shared all the boys when you were young and wild. We had a good time. You share the boys with her now? (horns honking outside) Who do you think will hurt her more, you or me? (door opens) Ingrid :  That's beautiful. Can you admit for a single moment that it's moving? No. (both laugh) Skip, Scott, Zak, all they talk about is percentages and ratios and nickels and f*cking dimes as if any of that matters if the music we're making is f*cking sh1t. Tell you what, I dodged a bullet. That f*cking building, man. Ernst :  That's the one I was thinking of. God saved me. He wants me to make a mark. I'm gonna do it, too. We're gonna make music, change the f*cking world. Thank me for it later. What? What? What are we thanking you for? I wasn't talking to you. Does surrounding yourself with idiots make you feel superior? How will you break new ground if this is who executes your vision? f*cking recipe for failure. You can't rest now. The process has just begun. Two coffees. He likes his black, black, black. Whoo! (music playing) ♪ Keep on knocking, but you can't come in ♪ 
♪ Keep on knocking, but you can't come in... ♪ Okay, I'll stay here, put the dodos in a row. You go downtown, find out where the f*ck she is. Reconnaissance. Don't freak her out. I shouldn't spank her for her behavior? Just locate her. Come back here, we move into phase two. Right? Of course, right. You got ketchup on your pants. Right there. f*cking slob. I wanted to get a hot dog from Nathan's, but some asshole wouldn't let me. (both laughing) You're never gonna let that go, are you? Cece! Coffee's brewing. Call Leo. Tell him to bring the car around. Ernst is coming down. I want him to give him a ride to the Village. ♪ You can't come in ♪ 
♪ Come back tomorrow night and try it again... ♪ (chuckles) I want legal pads with the white if they have, not the yellow, and some Flair pens. Then I want manila folders and labels and large envelopes. Andy? Holy sh1t. What a trip. (laughs) Look at you. You look great. And you called a meeting already. There's the bull by the horns. Yeah, you know, I figured I'd get all the names down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I usually run the Friday, but good to have someone else take the wheel. You sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Come on. It's a relief. My kid's bat mitzvah is tomorrow, so my mind's not even here. Is this Karen? Yeah. No, she's a baby. You were a baby. Huh? Look at you. Jesus, it's good to see you. All right, come on. It's gonna be here. Andrea :  All right, what do I need to know before I walk in there? (snorts)  ♪ Ah! ♪ (music playing) Whoa! Look at that. Hey! The prodigal daughter. What, nobody feeds you? You're all hair and mustache. Zito! Ah, you! I hear you finally passed the bar exam. Scott :  Twelfth time's the charm. ♪ Well, my heart went boom ♪ 
♪ When I crossed that room ♪ 
♪ And I held her hand in mine! ♪ 
♪ ...ine! ♪ Somewhere Paul McCartney is cringing. (laughs) Where you been all week? You still work here? See, that's the difference between you and me, okay? Is that I don't consider this work. Oh, someone tell accounting to freeze his paycheck. Andy Z, huh? Come on. Jackie Jervis is gonna slit his wrists without her. Christ, get him a Valium. Okay, that's it. That's it. I got my coffee. Take it away. I'm done. I really just want to say hi and I'm excited as sh1t to be here. I feel like I'm home. I love you guys. Tell them... tell them what you're gonna do. Come on, on a Friday? Go ahead. Guys, guys, she's gonna modernize us, okay? Reduce redundancies and sh1t. You... go ahead. It's nothing, really.  Gonna spruce up the offices a little. Spruce it up. Give the place a shot in the ass. Zak :  Decorating. Okay, here we go. Andrea :  The space has a classic feel that was really cool when you guys first started out, but now... Yeah, well, we got a budget situation, so decorating... Artists come in here, they think you're square. That and the logo. Uh, what's wrong with the logo? The toilet thing, enough already. I can't be the first person ever mention it to your face. The logo looks like a toilet. Penny :  Holy sh1t, it looks like a toilet. Skip :  With a turd? Casper :  Just a bowl. Scott :  f*ck, now it's like the duck and the rabbit. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. Maybe it's not a priority right now, but we are in the image business. We look like a toilet, it's a f*cking priority. Hal, you never saw this? Nobody saw it. Apparently everybody but us saw it. Look, easy to fix. Get a little color in here, new shape, put the sublabel front and center, have your college reps plug it. Yeah, we don't have college reps. We'll get that going. You working with Corso? What?!  Joe Corso. We got to get him to start talking up Grand Funk. I think we're leaving spins on the table. Tell Heather I want to see her. Where's Julie? We got a new band. He's helping them replace their lead guitar. You one of his guys? I'm one of his guys. Oh. Fantastic. You know about the Biafra Benefit? What, is that a disease? It's a country. Biafrica? It's in Africa. Biafra. What did I just say?  Biafrica. f*ck you. 14 artists will be performing. Jackie landed the soundtrack, but he did the whole thing on a handshake, and a handshake's not a deal, turns out. We could lock down Melanie for a set. Yeah. That's great. I was gonna talk to David Bowie. He doesn't like Jackie, so if it's not him, he might jump in. I met him, David Bowie, at Leon Schneider's thing last year. I could probably get a phone call in to his manager. Oh, David's in town tonight. I was just gonna stop by his rehearsal, take him out for a bite before the show. Oh, yeah, that'll work. You want to come? He'd love you. Look at this f*cking chick. Ain't she a kick in the ass? Zito! (music playing) There's so many things I want to do to you. Yeah. Now. There's so many... oh, yeah. Oh, that feels good. Yeah, play with it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, God. (muffled) I like that, too. (moaning) I'm so ready for you. Yeah? Are you ready for me? Oh, yeah, yeah. ♪ Yes, she's straight ♪ 
♪ Just won't wait ♪ 
♪ Everybody likes my Rocket 88 ♪  ♪ Baby, we'll ride in style... ♪ Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me some of that, yeah. Give it to me, yeah. Oh, tear me open. Are you okay? Can I suck on you? You know what? I got to go. No. What? Work. We'll try again another time, okay? You're f*cking beautiful. You just storm out? What the f*ck was that? I do what I want. Anyway, I already heard Andrea's spiel. That was for you. For me?  (snorting) We're paying through the nose for her. All her ideas are gonna cost us an arm and a leg. You remember math? I mean, I love Andrea, but... I know you do. You're a lover. (snorts) Ah! How about she steals back Hannibal, she's so valuable?  No. Why not? Because he tried to shove his dick inside my wife. Any other questions? (snorts) Oh! Whoo! I came up with that college idea months ago. Said we didn't have the money. Put on a dress next time. Maybe I'll listen better. f*ck. Coke dick. Didn't happen. Yeah. I don't even know where Devon is. She f*cking left. (knocks on door) Julie in the studio. You look like sh1t. Thank you. (Snorts) Speak. I need you to make an appearance. What? Why? 12 guys. Mr. Nasty sh1ts doesn't like anybody. I was gonna close my eyes for a minute. You kissed this frog, not me. Fine, fine, fine. I'll be right there.

♪ And I know it's got me reeling... ♪ Where is he? There he is. f*cking tidal wave. This kid's gonna blow the house down. You fall in love yet? I said no hippies. See all the hairballs out there holding up the wall? Lester wrote it on the ad. It said "No f*cking hippies." This is who showed up. Julie :  You want guitar players or you want people who look like you? Look's part of the act. Don't pretend it ain't. Go get me a pair of scissors. Hey, you pick the guy, I'll chop his f*cking hair off. They're all flat. They're bland toast. I can't carry the whole thing myself and I'm not gonna. Otto :  Oh, so we're just window dressing? Oh, don't f*cking start. I liked the guy with the hat. Why don't you ask him for a pint? Maybe he'll let you tap his winkie. (laughs) Hey, none of these guys had any energy? It's about him feeling it. Some guys got hands, but I ain't got to play with them. Yeah, he don't and I won't. So maybe we're done. Okay, look at me. I love you. Nonetheless, you don't pick a guy in the next five minutes, I'm gonna rip your head off your neck and put my own f*cking guitarist on top of it. Get the f*ck off, you c**t. (growls) Otto :  Whoa. That's f*cking perfect. Muscle the artist. Don't know why I didn't think of that. I don't know why either, frankly. You can't blow him off. It's lead guitar. The whole act is about raw emotion. If there's no chemistry, how's it gonna work? Who's this? Duck may have been bland onstage, but he made Kip feel like something special. These guys come in, they got fancy licks, they're showing him up. Maybe we pick a simpler song. Chuck Berry or something. Not f*cking Buddy Holly. What? Let me deal with this guy. Did you find them? Yes, but you should just forget it. What? She's letting off a little steam. What's that supposed to mean? What is this shithole? You don't have enough money to... f*ck that, man. Tell me what she's doing. They're downtown. Really high. Some guys were with them. I think they were f*cking. What? Why didn't you stop her? Because if she wants to f*ck another man, who am I to interfere? Just because you never managed to get yourself laid doesn't mean... f*ck you, man. Richie. No, shut up! (distant rattling) (distant people screaming) I heard them say they'd be at Max's tonight. We can retrieve her. Let's go. I need a drink first. And a toot. That's a good idea. If you could just sit and talk to him calmly... what are you doing? How about you just ask? She's wonderful. She sure is. Careful with this one. You f*ck her, she'll show up pregnant asking you to buy her a cottage by the sea. (laughs) I'm gonna need more cash if you're taking everything I have. (snorts) See? That's how it starts.

Men are horrible to her. That Jackie Jervis. I moved to American Century. What? Why? We'll talk about it later. Hey, baby. Mick, hey. So is this a Ziggy tour or just you? "Just you." Sounds disappointing. No, no, no, no. I'm a "Hunky Dory" fan. Don't get me wrong, I like a Spider from Mars as much as the next guy, but I feel like you let us in the door with "Hunky Dory." Intimate. Ziggy's retiring. Moving back to Mars? (chuckles) Something like that. Well, we got a benefit thing we want to pitch you and if Ziggy can't make it, maybe you come in his place. I don't think we... Is he not your boyfriend? This is Zak Yankovich from American Century. Should we get a bite to eat? Or maybe we could bring something in. I should have a nap before the show. Maybe dinner. Just the two of us. Perfect. Great meeting you. Yeah, yeah. See you later. Did I ruin that? I brought it up kind of early. Not at all. (music playing) (laughing) Where the f*ck did you go, man? I turn around, you disappear. I went to Nathan's to get a hot dog. (laughs) Hey, man. Who's in there? Iggy. Richie Finestra, American Century. Really? Cool, man. We're full. Let me see what I can do. Dynamite. Me and my friend. Excuse us. Shift thyselves. It's fantastic. So great. Andy! Richie, hi. Where is she? Uh, what? She must be inside. Are you f*cking hiding her from me? This is very exciting. Who are we talking about? f*cking smart-ass. Told you, this is why I don't really want to come here. Don't f*cking touch me. Let go of me! Man : What are you doing? f*ck you, man! Get the f*ck off me, man! Get the f*ck out of here! (horn honks) What the f*ck? Call the cops. Richie :  You sh1t! f*cking animal. I told you this was a bad idea. Come on, come on. (Ernst laughing) This f*cking place is beat, man. Max's. It's f*cking over! f*cking hear me? Christ. Let's take a walk. Get the f*ck off me. Let's take a walk. Better not f*cking call the cops. They're not. The f*cking... f*cking cops are after me. Agh. f*cking cops showing up everywhere I turn. You're freaking out. Get hold of yourself. You'll end up bashing someone's head in again. Like Buck Rogers. Who told you that? You did. It's why you're running amok. You feel guilty. What am I guilty about? The last honest man. This is the car. Firebird. Shall we? Are you f*cking nuts? Rave on, daddy-o. (laughs) Yeah. Act casual. Maybe this isn't such a great idea. Let's call your chauffeur. (engine starts) (radio blaring) Hop in. Whoo! (tires squeal) When I first met Paul, he was blowing men in... (music playing) (distant siren wailing) ...the bus terminal, what's it called? Port Authority?  Port Authority. (laughs) So he could buy a piece of marble. I told him plaster would be cheaper. (Devon laughs) And less labor-intensive. (laughs) I hope I'm not getting in your hair, you two. Please. This place, it's like a youth hostel.  (distant laughter, chatter) Yeah. I deserve a guest of my own now and again. Is he, um... I was gonna say he seems like a handful, but you love that, so... Do I love it? I don't know anymore. Is that Ernst? You took it. Did I? We should sell it. It's probably worth something. Yeah, he was more of a handful than this one. Really? Absolutely. Paul peacocks about, but he's very loving. Cries when I go out alone. (laughs) Ernst could be so merciless. Richie softened him. Mmm. We were all better together than separately. That's probably true. Richie's a good man. Don't make me burn you with this perfectly good joint. One bender. He'll stop like he did before. You shouldn't go down this road. Unless it's not him. Unless you've fallen out of love with the pastoral f*cking idyll. Day after day in that house, I hear this creaking back and forth. It's the sound of me hanging myself from the rafters. I don't want you going back there. (Devon laughs) I mean it. Go to the f*cking innkeeper, Stanley. Convince him you're an artist. He'll give you a place. I'm not an artist. Here we go again. You are an artist when you say you're an artist. sh1t on a canvas. Sing that song you did with Nico. The one that sounded like a cow giving birth. (laughs) (crying) Oh, my love. I wish I could. Your children can grow up here. Yeah, they'll wander the halls. They'll learn German from the balalaika player upstairs. (laughs) (distant chattering) (door slams) I'm so lonely. It's pathetic.
