 Previously, on "The Path": 
 I have decided to leave the gates open so that anyone can enter as they please. 
 Since when does an IS know more than we do? 
 This doesn't feel like change. 
 It feels like it's the beginning of the end. 
 You're Hawk Lane, huh? 
 I was just expecting some bearded old hippie dude. 
 You saved me. 
 You did that. 
 Say it. 
 I did that. 
 Here, in case you want to talk some more. 
 Yeah, I don't. 
 No, about... your religion. 
 It's easy to be punished. 
 It's harder to forgive yourself. 
 Meyerism... doesn't work for me anymore. 
 I think something bad happened to me when I was a child. 
 The son is here. 
 It begins. 
 Is anybody out here? 
 ♪ 
 ♪ 
 ♪ Uh, I'm Sarah Lane. 
 So tell me what brought you in here today. 
 I'm scared. 
 Feels like we're headed towards World War III. 
 What brought you here today? 
 I have to lose a hundred pounds. 
 What brought you here today? 
 I have a drinking problem. 
 I broke up with my girlfriend. 
 If it wasn't for my kids, I wouldn't even get out of bed in the morning anymore. 
 Nuclear war, the environment... 
 World's falling apart. 
 What have you tried? 
 Weight Watchers, paleo, no carbs, gastric bypass... 
 I had to explain to my kindergartener what a school shooter is. 
 We can help you. 
 Everyone looks so happy here. 
 Hypnotism, aversion therapy... 
 We can help you. 
 I can't watch the news anymore. 
 I feel like I'm wasting my life. 
 We can help you. 
 What are you looking for? 
 Love. 
 Community. 
 Guidance. 
 Safety. 
 Peace. 
 How did you get here? 
 Where are you from? 
 What's your name? 
 Look, kid... 
 I really want to help you out, but you got to give me something. 
 Logan. 
 All right. 
 Where are you supposed to be right now? 
 School? 
 Where are your parents? 
 Dead. 
 Okay, where do you stay when you're not hiding out in our woods? 
 My brother's place. 
 Who beat you up? 
 Couple of his friends. 
 What's the deal with that? 
 My brother gave it to me. 
 Helped me get by in juvie. 
 So you've been to juvie? 
 Twice. 
 Do you believe in it? 
 The tattoo? - Yeah. 
 Doesn't mean anything. 
 Listen, Logan, this is a community full of love and acceptance. 
 We do not tolerate hate. 
 I don't hate anybody. 
 What? 
 I don't hate anybody. 
 Why did you kill those rabbits? 
 ♪ Because I hadn't eaten anything in four days, and I was f*cking hungry. 
 ♪ 
 It's so pretty here. 
 Yep. 
 Uh, I have to get out of here. 
 What do you mean? 
 I just can't be here. Just, um... we have to go. 
 Where? - I don't know. 
 We don't have much money saved. 
 We need a place to stay, money for diapers... 
 Mary, you don't understand. I'm suffocating. 
 I can't be this person anymore. 
 I... this-this servant. 
 Okay. Yeah, of course. 
 Wait, you mean... you mean leave right now? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna talk to Harold, we'll get our things together... 
 Is he gonna let us? 
 We're not prisoners. 
 Why don't we sneak out when he's asleep? 
 God, no, no, this is exactly why we have to go, because I can't be somewhere where... where we're trapped. 
 And what about the contract? 
 I'll talk to him. 
 All right? 
 Uh, he can't force us to stay. 
 ♪ 
 American religion is a private, personal experience. 
 Bloom argues that almost all American religious groups... 
 Uh, Seventh-Day Adventism, Mormonism, Southern Baptists, Pentecostalism... 
 Believe that salvation cannot be achieved by engaging with a community, but rather by an intense inward solitude, that you must experience some kind of direct confrontation with God in order to be saved. 
 Now, since we have our friendly resident fringe movement representative here with us, Sarah... 
 Tell us. 
 Is that how you understand Meyerism? 
 No. 
 I mean, confrontation is such a negative... word. 
 Experiencing The Light is a... positive, profound experience. 
 Has it always been that way? 
 I mean, Steve Meyer, didn't he... find darkness and destruction at the top of that Ladder? 
 I mean, he only saw that so he could lead the rest of us to The Light. 
 To the Truth. 
 Sorry, I have to go. 
 Tell you what, guys: class dismissed. 
 sh1t. 
 At least you weren't towed. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Was I pissing you off back there? 
 Uh, no, not at all. 
 I'm just, um, late for a meeting. Right. And if, uh, you're late, then they make you scrub the bathroom floors with a toothbrush. 
 What if they found out you were here? 
 They'd be fine. 
 Yeah. 
 You have this narrative in your head about Meyerism, and it's... 
 It's not like that. 
 We have free will. 
 Good, because I wanted to ask you a question. 
 Uh, would you like to have dinner with me? 
 No. 
 That's not... No. 
 Because you're not... allowed, or because you don't want to? 
 Whatever makes you feel better about yourself. 
 This kid was me, 20 years ago. 
 You didn't have a swastika tattooed to your arm. 
 No, but I had other sh1t. 
 We all did. 
 That is how we got here. 
 Okay? He is just a kid. 
 We can help him. 
 He's not a kid. 
 He had a knife. We're open, but we can't be fools about it. 
 Look, in our community, we accept people for who they are. 
 Without judgement. 
 That's always been the way. 
 These are different times. 
 We can't afford to be naive. 
 Religious communities are targets. 
 We're getting more... More Possibles than ever. 
 I'm doing a dozen intake sessions a day. 
 People don't feel safe in their communities, and they are coming to us. 
 Does this boy want to live in The Light, or does he want free room and board? 
 Look, it is our job to show him The Light and hope that he makes that choice for himself. 
 Vera can help communicate what we're doing to the community. - Vera... isn't one of us. 
 She has no part in this conversation. 
 We need to assess the boy's Damage. 
 Assess the boy's Damage. 
 What, by doing the ODE? 
 We don't do that anymore. 
 Because we haven't had to. 
 We haven't had anyone like him come through. 
 The ODE is the only way to determine whether or not he can truly receive The Light. 
 Sarah, will you administer? 
 I'll set it up. 
 If he fails, he has to go. 
 Are we in agreement? 
 ♪ Yeah. 
 Let's do the test. 
 ♪ 
 Wow. This is an embarrassment. 
 Okay, Mom, please, breathe. 
 So, what do you think? 
 What the hell have you been doing the last two weeks? 
 Uh, we made a lot of progress. 
 Sorry, I'm Tom. 
 Vera. - Wow, I've heard so much about you... No, no, okay, don't shake his hand. You should kiss her feet. 
 Do you understand what he's been doing for us? 
 We need Meyerism to spread to all four corners of the Earth, and it's well on its way because of her. 
 New members every day, college kids drinking that dumbass juice, and their leader can't take a piss without asking her first, but meanwhile, you can't even install a fan. 
 Lilith, this type of work takes time. I had to design... 
 It's not a f*cking tea party. 
 It has to be finished. 
 You can't be setting the table when the end comes. 
 Work faster. 
 Do you realize how little time we have? 
 Dear, can you tell him what happens if they don't finish in time? 
 Yeah. You'll die like the rest of them. 
 ♪ 
 Nobody has anything to unburden? 
 ♪ 
 Then let me offer strength and community to us all as we continue our journey to enlightenment in climbing... 
 The Ladder of Truth. 
 Joy... Yeah? 
 What was that? 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Yeah, I know. Nobody did. 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 Honestly, a lot of people are really freaked out by that Nazi kid. 
 He's not a Nazi. It goes against everything we believe, not to mention it puts us at risk every time we step on the compound. 
 Okay, well, why didn't anybody say anything? 
 That's the entire point of unburdening. 
 Because it's your dad's decision, and you're like your dad's good little foot soldier. 
 Okay, that is not true at all. 
 Okay, so if people had said something, you what? 
 Go and ask your dad, and he... No, I... 
 Kicks the kid out? 
 I would sit with him and I would ask... - Okay, Hawk. 
 You're white. 
 Maybe you can afford to assume that you're safe, but some of us can't. 
 Anyway, whatever. I need your help with something. 
 Okay. - I need you to go bowling with me. 
 Okay, what? 
 Caleb and some of the Musa kids are going and he asked us if we could go. 
 Well, why... why c... Why do I have to go? 
 Why can't you just go with Caleb? 
 Because, I'm pretty sure they can't date outside their religion, so it's probably, like, a group date thing. 
 I have a girlfriend... 
 Yeah, who's doing 2R in Haiti. 
 Hawk, come on. 
 You've had a little bit of a stick up your ass since your dad became leader. 
 You don't have to be the son of God all the time. 
 Bowling might be good for you.

 Are you ready to begin? 
 ♪ 
 Where am I? 
 You're in an evaluation room. 
 We're getting ready to start Observable Damage Evaluation. 
 How did you get me here? 
 We moved you. 
 You drugged me. 
 No, we gave you a safe herbal sleep aid so we can start with your mind perfectly clear.

 Do you feel sorry for others who have less than you? 
 Yes. 
 Do you feel sorry for yourself? 
 No. 
 In general, do you believe bad things that happen are your fault? 
 No. 
 Have other done bad things to you? 
 Yes. 
 What would you change about yourself? 
 I wish I could change what other people see about me. 
 Are your harder on yourself or on others? 
 I don't know. - Go deeper. 
 Other people are harder on me. 
 What do you mean? 
 I don't know. Nothing. 
 Nobody gives me a chance. 
 Everybody just assumes I'm a piece of sh1t. 
 Why is that? 
 Probably 'cause my parents are both pieces of sh1t, and my brother's a piece of sh1t. 
 Usually runs in the family, I guess. 
 You told Eddie that your parents were dead. 
 My dad is. 
 And your mom? 
 Didn't want me. 
 Who are you closest to? 
 In the world, right now? 
 Who are you closest to? 
 Nobody. 
 Do you remember the last time you felt joy? 
 I don't know. 
 Go deeper. 
 When I was 12, my brother got me a pet chicken. 
 What did you name it? 
 Captain. 
 He was really smart. 
 He was my best friend for, like, two years. 
 What happened? 
 ♪ Cockfight. 
 My brother made me do it. 
 Captain was really sweet. He didn't stand a chance.

 He scored a 28. 
 All right. 
 Well, give him another shot. 
 Okay, maybe he was nervous. 
 No, that's not how it works. Steve was a psychiatrist. 
 He worked with a lot of people that had Damage. 
 He knew how to find darkness. 
 All right, well, let me work with him for a couple of weeks. 
 Okay? I mean, he's so young. 
 And he didn't have a choice. I mean... 
 Dead dad, his mom... 
 Look, maybe I can get to him. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 It does matter. 
 I refuse to believe that some people are beyond help. 
 You promised the Council. 
 What if you guys turned your backs on me? 
 You scored a 97 on the ODE. 
 How do you know that? Because people talked about it. You were... 
 Damaged, but you were full of Light. 
 This kid is beyond the capacity to help. 
 Where is he supposed to go? 
 His brother is his legal guardian. 
 He's not going back there. 
 Well, then, I'll make some calls. 
 I'll connect with child services. 
 I am not sending him to child services. 
 They can help him. 
 We can't. 
 And if you can't do it, I will. 
 No. 
 I brought him in. I'll do it. 
 Been two days. 
 I still feel like sh1t. 
 Thanks, boss. 
 Pickled ume. It'll, uh, replace your electrolytes. 
 Here. Under your tongue. 
 Um... 
 Harold, I need to apologize. 
 Um... The other night, I... I let you down. 
 We both f*cked up. Yeah, but I'm supposed to be stronger, and I let my own Damage get in the way of our progress together. 
 It's okay. - No, it's not, which is why I need to go away and do some work on myself. 
 Yeah, because I'm not in the condition, right now, to help someone else. 
 What? - I... I can't afford to inflict any more harm onto you. 
 Mary and I need to leave. 
 You can't. No, well, I understand we had an agreement. We signed a contract. 
 We can't stay here anymore. 
 That's not how it works. You don't break contracts. 
 That's the point of a f*cking contract. 
 Look it up. Look it up on your phone. 
 No, I'm not going to do that. 
 Saul! 
 "A written or spoken agreement, enforceable by law." 
 "By law." You're breaking the law! 
 You can't do this.

 I don't. I need you! 
 No, you are all you need.

 So, are you guys allowed to date outside the religion, or are you, like, breaking the rules? 
 I mean, it's not rules that we have, but, yes, technically, we're supposed to date other Christians. 
 'Cause we'll corrupt you or something? 
 No, no.
