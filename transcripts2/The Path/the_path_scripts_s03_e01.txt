 Previously on "The Path"... 
 Any sign of Eddie? His house is full of deniers. What are they doing there? 
 They want to reform the movement. 
 Is it true, what they're all saying about you? 
 Steve asked me to guide the movement. 
 I'm climbing the rungs with Richard and Felicia, and when I am ready, I am going to replace Cal. 
 Eddie, I've done things. 
 I've been with someone else. 
 Go home and deal with it. 
 Our daughter... I want to see her. 
 You have your own son now. 
 We have a son, and you should let him and everyone know. 
 Forest. 
 Forest Roberts. 
 Richard, what are you doing? Sarah, run! 
 Sarah blackmailed the people who came to her for help. 
 It was my crime, and if I wanted to pay for it, I should have been able to. 
 If you want to be punished, you don't have to out searching for it. 
 Your life will be hell.

 Hello? 
 Hello. - Vera Stephens. 
 I'm here about the position. 
 Oh, uh... what position? 
 The one I wrote to you about. 
 Oh, right. Vera. 
 You are the... the publicist, right? 
 Oxford educated... you worked for Greenpeace... and Breitbart. 
 I think they both needed a facelift. 
 Yeah, no, they, uh... they look great. 
 Is there somewhere we can maybe sit down? 
 Uh, actually, no, there's not a chair in the building... just a big, empty space. 
 The new New York City Meyerist Center. 
 Yeah, um, I hope so. 
 You know, the truth is a lot of publicists have thrown their... their hats in the ring, and if I felt like I needed one, you'd be the first person I would call, truly. 
 But I just don't think I need one. 
 I don't want to be your publicist. 
 But I do think you're gonna need someone to help you manage the influx of money, members, and all the general mess that has arisen now that you've trended on YouTube... 
 And become... 
 A religious figure/legend. Right. 
 And not to mention handle the media. 
 I'm sure you've already been inundated with offers for interviews... 
 Not sure which one to take? 
 Yeah, "Spirituality Today" offered me their cover. 
 Don't take it. 
 They got readership all over the world. 
 Only premium, mainstream publications. 
 I see you on the cover of "The Sunday Times Magazine"... 
 "The New Face of Faith" or something like that, you know? 
 No fringe. Nothing that puts you over there with them. 
 This is about where Meyerism is going, not where it has been. 
 First of all, I, uh... I just want to say thank you for coming out to... 
 To celebrate our new home in New York City. 
 You know, we've grown a lot over the past six months, but the work has just begun. 
 These are tough times. 
 Our towns are being ravaged by substance abuse. 
 Hate groups are springing up in our neighborhoods. 
 We are living within a politically divided nation where marginalized groups are feeling more and more marginalized. 
 But you are welcome here. 
 See, I... I've been to The Garden. 
 I've seen that it's not just for a chosen few... but for everyone... 
 Anyone who walks this path. 
 And that is why I have decided to take down the guard booth and leave the gates to The Garden open so that anyone can enter as they please. 
 He's gonna get us all killed. 
 ♪ I mean, it seems crazy to remove security in times like these, but I'm... I'm not gonna say anything. 
 You should. You should say something. 
 You're the one that's being realistic. 
 No, I've completely extricated myself from making any of those kinds of decisions. 
 Maybe you should go see a therapist... 
 A real one, not a Meyerist. 
 Look, obviously, I'm just getting to know you again, but you just seem like you're suffering. 
 And what that man did to you in your house... 
 What I did to that man was horrible. 
 Right, and that's what therapy is for. 
 Do you think I'd be able to sit with you here right now if I hadn't been talking to a professional three times a week? 
 I'm doing extra sessions just so I can make it to the big dinner on Friday.

 But it's not my fault. The economy is sh1t.

 Why apply to use our interfaith space? 
 Why not just use your dad's church? 
 Our interfaith space is reserved for groups in need. 
 Well, first of all, like you said, my dad's church is in Westchester. 
 And I think that our youth group would have a wider reach here in the city. 
 You know, can I just be honest with you? 
 We are all about honesty here. 
 I'm looking to kind of individuate from my dad and his word... 
 Find my own word. 
 Or... I don't know. How can I say this better? 
 Uh...

 Hey, uh, Uncle Eddie, did you hear that Hawk made a decision to loan the interfaith space to a born-again mega-church group? 
 I felt their need was sincere, so... 
 Their beliefs couldn't be more diametrically opposed to ours, so... 
 Well, that's what the interfaith space is for... 
 To expose different faiths to each other. 
 Helps us keep an open mind. 
 Speaking of open minds, how about that press conference, huh? 
 Taking down walls when the whole world is building them up. 
 Sarah told me about that. 
 I think it's a little nuts, with all the violence against others right now. 
 And you guys are others. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Well, it just means you're a cult, and people still think of you as a cult. 
 Okay, I really resent that. 
 Not now. Tessa, we are not a cult. 
 And people are gonna stop seeing us that way. 
 Okay, then, why don't we put the food on the table? 
 Yeah, that's a good idea. All right. 
 You all right? - Great. 
 That's a nice shirt.

 Look, we just work together. That is all. 
 Anyway, let's not get into that right now. 
 Here's something interesting. 
 I had a Meyerist today that, uh, really got to me. 
 He wants to be punished. 
 But now that you've gotten rid of all the White Rooms, how do we help people who are really struggling with that? 
 It's easy to be punished. 
 It's harder to forgive yourself. 
 Maybe. 
 But I was reading Steve's early writings on penance, and it seems that before he came to realignment, he was experimenting with... more severe forms. 
 The HC. 
 Do you know what that is? 
 Are you sure you're asking for someone else... and not for yourself? 
 Why don't you put the eggplant on the table? 
 Hey. Sarah, you can talk to me. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, before we start dinner, I think you should see... this. 
 Vera is going to slap him with a cease and desist. 
 He can't use Meyerism like this. 
 Well, I mean, you said The Light is for everyone. 
 This isn't The Light. 
 This is Cal exploiting the message for his own personal gain. 
 Anyways, I just thought that you... should know, in case he... 
 In case we're still talking?
