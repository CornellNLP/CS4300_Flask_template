 Previously, on "The Path"... 
 Will you come to my house? 
 I'm not really supposed to hang out with girls like you. 
 I just really need someone to see what's happening there. 
 Hawk : I just couldn't let you live without light. 
 Thank you. 
 Why haven't I received a report on Miranda Frank's status? 
 She's denying everything. 
 I asked them to bring her here. 
 It's our son... we want him to do your rehab program. 
 Cal : I promise we will get him off drugs. 
 Steve let me know about the final rungs that he's receiving. 
 It's telling him that it is time to put a new leader in his place. 
 It's you. It's always been you. 
 What about the guy who did this to me? 
 Sean : We're doing everything we can to gather information on him, Mr. Cox. 
 f*cking animal has got my daughter. 
 I will bring your daughter back. 
 You're doing to me what you have done to my family. 
 You will stay here and complete the program. 
 Miranda Frank is here. 
 What is she doing here? 
 She wouldn't unburden, Eddie. 
 Hey, hey, hey, Miranda! What happened? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [ominous music] 
 ♪ ♪ [sighs] ♪ ♪ [phone chimes] It's not him. Well, I think we should just try him again. It's been at least two hours since they took her to the hospital. Cal said he'd let us know as soon as the doctor had news. Ugh. Oh, God. Eddie, I need to unburden. I did this, whatever happened to Miranda. Passing out... No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. If it was anyone's fault, it was mine. Listen to me. Stop. I lost my head. Is she in love with you? What? No. No. Sarah, I promise. 'Cause it just doesn't make any sense. Is she trying to protect you? No, she is not in love with me. Okay? She's not. Why were you going to see her? Honestly, I... I just wanted to say that I was sorry. [phone chimes] Bill and Felicia are coming. ♪ ♪ Those of you who climb the rungs will not perish. You will live in The Garden forever. What happens to the rest of us? I don't know. Either we burn in the fire, drown in the flood, or... get eaten by that. What is that? I don't know. You really think these people are criminals? Ah, all I know is I have a father from Rindge who wants to get his daughter back. I'm gonna make sure she gets out of there. Something dark going on. How do you know? Instinct, baby. [baby crying] Instinct. [laughs] [baby cries louder] There's something wrong with her. Yeah, well, she's a baby. Babies cry. Not like this. Doctor said it was colic. Look, I am telling you, there's something wrong. That's my f*cking instinct. [baby screaming, crying] ♪  ♪ I can't believe this place. 
The colors... When was the last time you were here? Must be about ten years. Ah... you were pregnant with Summer. So, just about. You look great, Eddie. I appreciate that. It's been a rough couple weeks. We heard. [laughing] Hey! Here they are! Aw. Oh, my God. You never age. Oh, look at you. So happy to see you. Muah. All this time. Oh! [laughs] Pretty good, huh? Ah, the smell is so clean. San Diego is already burning. This is the place. Do you really think? Why don't I show you to your bungalow? Yeah. What made you decide to come? To join the Ascension Day festivities. Why wouldn't we come? ♪ ♪ Cal : How are you feeling? Miranda : Tired. Cal : Oh, they have you on painkillers. Miranda : Why am I here? Cal : The doctor said you passed out, low blood sugar. You broke your arm when you fell. Miranda : Yeah, no, I know why I'm in the hospital. What I don't understand is why Eddie's telling these crazy lies about me. ♪ ♪ Why is this happening to me? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, I just... ♪ ♪ Can you think of anything that happened between you and Eddie that may have led him to believe you were having an affair? Something he misconstrued? No. Because... Steve once said to me, "Sometimes a thought can be so powerful it transcends thought." You mean, if I thought about Eddie in a way that was... Maybe... That thought took on a life of its own, yes. Maybe... Tell me. You know I don't judge. So, Miranda and I, we had a long talk. What did she say? He was crying, and... What is it, Miranda? Unburden, and you shall be free of that weight. She unburdened. Miranda : He took the medicine. 
He said he saw his brother. She did? Miranda : Then he went off somewhere, and when he came back, something was wrong. Transgress 4, on the retreat. He kept saying, "There is no Light. There is no Light. There is no Light." And he was crying, and... What? What? What is it, Miranda? And she said that she and Eddie... Everything that happened in Peru. I hugged him. I wanted to take care of him, but he just cried, and then Silas took him away, and we never spoke again. Do you think I... Ugh. [crying] Shh. It's over. You can start to heal. ♪ ♪ With this current, we stimulate our neo-self... the self we were before the damage came. Are any of you able to find it? Yes. I found it. Great. Okay, let's all breathe in. [all inhale] Breathe the damage out. [all exhale forcefully] Today, I choose to live in The Light. All : Today, I choose to live in The Light. Great work, everyone. Okay, you can remove your machines and put them back in the basket. Thanks, Sarah. Hi! Hi. How are you feeling? Really good. Yeah? Yeah. And I wanted to say... I'm sorry. These last two weeks have made me realize how much I've hurt you. I'm so sorry for what I've put you through, and myself through. I-I hit my bottom. Right? I know I did, but I'm not gonna do it anymore. Okay. All right? I can't do it anymore. I'm sorry, Dad. Hey. Um, could you tell me where Miranda Frank's room is, please? Oh, she's no longer here. She's gone? Yep. Checked out this morning. [sighs] Look, I'm sorry, I was told that she was gonna be here for a few more days. Nope. Could you tell me if she left with someone, or... That kind of information's confidential. [sighs] All right, I should've told you this before, but I'm... I'm her brother, okay? And I just need to know where she went. I'm sorry. I can't help you. God. You see, I think that you can help me. I just need you to tell me if you know where she went or who she went with or what the f*ck is going on with her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just... look. This is very important, okay? I'm gonna ask you once to leave, and then I'm gonna call security. Oh, my God. All right. You know what? Forget it. He's from that cult, right? It's not a f*cking cult! What happened with Eddie Lane, Silas? On the 6R retreat? We took the medicine. We saw Light. We climbed The Ladder. You're gonna have to give me a little more than that. What happens on a retreat is private. It's between the Ascender and The Light. Why are Bill and Felicia here? Why do you think Bill and Felicia are there? Because they think I'm f*cking up with running things, this whole... this whole thing with Miranda Frank. Well, there you go. Everything you need to know, you know. You're 10R, after all. Well, I don't know what Eddie's hiding. Huh. Don't you? I intend to find out. I heard Bill and Felicia can take one look at you and see your entire life. I heard we're gonna get to see Felicia's hands. What about her hands? My dad said they've come to check on things because this is the place. What place? Where The Garden will be. When The Future comes. It's coming? When? Nobody knows when. Hawk, your family knows everything. Hawk? Hawk! What? Is The Future coming? Yes. [bell rings] I don't want it to come. [indistinct chatter] Do you think that he'll be ready to come home soon? I think your son has gotten very good at knowing what you want to hear. I know my son. Well, I know Truth. And he's lying. What can we do? We believe that people with serious addictions like Freddie are using drugs to... to bury some deep pain. We use a special medicinal compound to help find that wound. And once they do, they begin to start to heal. What kind of medicinal compound? It's a special brew of dimethyltryptamine. It's a new approach to medicine. They've been using it the last few years on cancer patients at Sloan Kettering Ayahuasca? It's Ayahuasca. It does have some of the same properties. This is bullshit. I knew it was bullshit, and I let you convince me, but now I've had enough. We're going. Get Freddie. You take Freddie out of here, and he will have a needle in his arm within 24 hours. Honey? Can we just... We're going. You reached out like the first of us to reach out for that rung. But every single one of you has known the courage that he show... Eddie. Where is she? Where is Miranda? I went to the hospital, Cal. Well, she's being taken care of, Eddie. What does that mean? She's resting peacefully. She didn't want to be in a hospital anymore. [sighs] All right, well, look. She deserves an apology, okay? I'm afraid that's not gonna happen. Why not? Because maybe she'd prefer not to see you. And I'll tell you someone else who'd probably prefer you didn't see her is your wife. Ugh. So let it go, Eddie. Miranda understands you're sorry for everything that happened between the two of you. Unless... there's more to the story. You don't trust me. You used to. We were close. What happened? I guess people change, Cal. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ You should do 7R, Eddie. What? Get back on The Ladder. I'll be your guide. I just finished 6. No, it's the most thrilling rung of The Ladder. It... it... you and your guide, you... become one. Together, you break down each other's delusions, the lies we tell ourselves, the lies that we tell others. I-I think we... we can really learn a lot from each other. ♪ ♪ Of course. No, I understand that. I understand why you're angry. I will fix this for you, John. John, if you bring Freddie back in, I promise... [groans] Sarah! When were you gonna tell me what happened with John Ridge? Well, sorry, I'm not gonna tell him his son is cured just because he said he was gonna give us a million dollars. You shouldn't have recommended the medicine. Why? It's one of our most successful methods of treatment. Besides, Freddie Ridge is not gonna get better without it. Well, we're not gonna be using the medicine anymore. The medicine is one of the foundations of our movement. It's dangerous, and we're trying to reach more people. We just had a member wind up in the hospital, and we need to start being more careful. John Ridge is a powerful man. 
If something happened to his kid, it would be all over the news, and we would be shut down. We would never survive that, all right? So if his kid comes back here, you are not to give him the medicine. Am I clear? ♪ ♪ Um, can you please eat some? I'm eating, like, all of them. You should. You didn't even eat lunch. How'd you know? I saw. So are you allowed to go to parties? Yeah. We have one tomorrow afternoon for Ascension Day. No, I mean like real parties. Like, at night. There's one tomorrow in Magic Meadow. So do you want to go? Um... I don't think I'm allowed. Okay, just don't tell your parents. We're not supposed to lie to our parents. Okay, this sounds like the worst religion ever. [laughs] Do you like Arcade Fire? We're not allowed to play video games. Uh, it is a band, not a video game. Are you even allowed to listen to music, or... No, yeah, we... we are. We just... a lot of contemporary music brings darkness into the world, so we listen to stuff from the '60s and '70s. More hopeful. So old people music is what you're saying. [both laugh] Um, you should borrow this. It'll change the way you look at the world. [pensive music] ♪ ♪ [no audible dialogue] ♪ ♪ [no audible dialogue] ♪ ♪ Thought I might find you here. In your contemplation spot. Wow. So what are you contemplating this evening? The longest 48 hours. Mm. [sighs] And Cal's giving me sh1t about Freddie Ridge, and... this Miranda thing. Hopefully, we can all get past this now. Really? Yeah. I want to. Hey, so, um... Cal... he asked me to move up to 7R. Really? I know, it's really quick, but... he thinks I'm ready. Silas is an amazing guide. You know, when he led me, he saw things in me, and I in him. Actually, Cal would be my guide. What? Nothing. I think it's great. And, you know, at 7R, you'd only be one rung below me. Hm. Well, that's because I'm coming after you. [laughs] Oh, really? Yeah. You're coming after me? Yeah, I'm coming straight for you, actually. Oh, well then. Yeah. Come and get me. [laughs] So, are we... are we good? You know what might make us good is you jumping in this lake. [laughs] Oh, yeah? Yeah. You want me to jump in the lake? Yeah, I kind of do. Okay. And that'll make us good? I think that'll make us good. [water ripples] Oh, no, no, no. [laughs] Is it cold? Oh, my God. Oh, I definitely want you to jump in. Well, I want us to be good, so... I'll go in. But you have to come with me. Oh, my God. There's no way. Yeah. No, come on. No, there's... no! Come on. Don't! Don't! No! Don't you dare. Don't, Eddie! Ah! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't believe we just did that. [laughs] We are definitely not good. Oh, we're not good? Definitely not. Okay, that's fine. Oh, my God. It's really cold. Stop... I'm freezing! [both laugh] [panting] Brr, it's so cold! It's so f*cking cold. Oh, my God. Did you drive? Yeah. Okay. We should maybe go. Okay, on the count of three, we're gonna run for it, okay? Yeah. One... both : Two. Three! Go! Oh, my God. Oh! Oh! Oh, my God. Hurry! Hurry! This is colder-running! 
 
 Hey. Hey, Felicia. I was just about to leave. I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to catch up properly. I've been so busy getting ready for tomorrow. Let me take something off your plate. No, no, no. No need. I think we're all set now. Well, thank you for putting everything together. Of course. Now you get to sit back and enjoy the day tomorrow. [laughs] Well... Bill and I will take things from here. Well, I've prepared the Ascension Day oration. Oh, I'll do it. I was there, after all, the day it happened. True. [both laugh] Okay. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. [knocking at door] Come in. Hi. Sorry to come by so late. It's okay. I wanted to ask you a favor. Anything. Ascension Day, tomorrow... I want you to speak. Me? Mm-hm. You've been doing so well here. I'm very impressed with you. I've been hanging out a lot with Sean. Oh. Yeah, yeah. [chuckles] How's that going? It's good. Fun, I think... I don't know, but I think he likes me. Well, of course he likes you. 
You're beautiful. Not... not just outside. Inside. You're bursting with Light, Mary. Well, we haven't had s*x yet. Oh, no? Mm-mm. But... he kisses me a lot. [breathing heavily] Hm. Where? First, my neck. [shaky breathing] No, no. [zipper rasps] [grunts] My mouth. My lips. And what else? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Over my chest. ♪ ♪ Then... ♪ ♪ [heavy breathing] Right... here. But I was pretending it was you. [stifled panting] Is that bad? [heavy breathing, grunting] ♪ ♪ Thank you, Mary. Now get some rest. Have a big day tomorrow. On October 28, 1974, we watched Steve climb The Ladder. Me, my husband William, and Silas. I tried to climb after him, but when I went to touch The Ladder, it was burning hot. [crowd gasps in awe] Oh, my God. Steve was allowed to climb so he could deliver the message. And you,  you...  all of you heard the word. And now the word is in you. The message: there is work to do. Oh, yeah. [quiet clapping] We must refuse Ignorance. We must refuse Damage. We must save the world from The Future. Yes. [applause] Today, we celebrate that the message came to us, that The Light lives inside us. And we renew our promise to keep it alive. [cheers and applause] Whoo! [cheers and applause continue] Whoo! So everyone in here is on a different rung of The Ladder. And what am I? Well, you're not on The Ladder yet. You are what we call a Possible. If you want to climb to 10, you have to devote your life to service of The Movement. Ah, lovely day, huh? Every day here is. Yeah. That's what I hear. How did you find this place? This place found me. Almost. Not really. It's better than it was before. Ugh! So who was that girl? 'Cause you can go so far. Hey, Summer. They're doing face painting by the musicians. [gasps] Can I go? Yeah. Nobody. What, is she, like, a cheerleader? She's not a cheerleader. She plays softball. [laughs] You're totally in love with her. I'm not in love with her. I just said she plays softball. She's probably just trying to see if she can corrupt you. She's not gonna corrupt me. She's gonna try. Did she try to kiss you? No. What you're feeling is just hormones, Hawk. I have sexual feelings too. It's natural. But it's not real. You have to unburden to your parents. I don't have anything to unburden. ♪ ♪ Family and honesty is the cornerstone of The Movement. You could lose all of us. I mean, you do want to be with us, don't you? When The Future comes? ♪ ♪ [laughter] And then... and then the phone rang. And... oh, I forget what we were doing. We were smoking. What else would we be doing? Oh, I was pregnant. I was not smoking. And you said, "Gaby, get Hank on the phone. "We've just had the most incredible experience. I burned my hands." You shouted, "Felicia just burned her hands! Get on the other line!" Yeah, and you picked up the phone, and you said... "Toothpaste. Toothpaste works for a burn." [laughter] You guys were high. I said, "Oh, no." I said, "No. We found it. Get on a plane and get down here. We found The Light." And we did. And that's when we met Doc. And I remember thinking, "Today's the day. It is the first day of my life." Great marijuana down there, too. I wish I'd never left. [laughter] [children laugh and shout] It was great to see you. See you real soon. Bye. Bye-bye. Great day. Yeah. My favorite day of the year. You haven't gotten anything to eat. I don't like to let the members see me eat. It shows weakness. It also shows community. Ah, there you are. Eh, hey. Yeah, I just... I just wanted to get away for a minute. Me too. It's exhausting. Yeah. How you doing? Uh, good. Good. You know, I think Sarah and I are gonna be okay. So that's what matters. Yes, it is. Can I ask you a question? Mm-hm. Have you talked to Miranda since she left the hospital? She left the hospital? I wasn't aware. Cal said that she just didn't want to be there anymore, said she's resting someplace. ♪ ♪ I hear he asked you to climb 7R. Yeah. It'll be good for us to have someone close to him. We'd ask Sarah to keep an eye out, but she doesn't always see clearly when it comes to Cal. ♪ ♪ I came here from Rindge, New Hampshire. My mom died when I was little, so my dad raised me. When I was 11, my dad told me that his friend was coming over, and I should do what he said, otherwise I'd get hit. So his friend came over... and afterwards, I saw him give my dad some money.

You've gotten a little too big for your britches, son. I'm not your son. A 6R from the Midwest was forcibly removed from her home and brought here. You're trying to get rid of the medicine. Steve put me in charge. And asked us to watch over you. We don't like the job you're doing. This Movement needs a leader, or it will fall apart. The Movement has a leader. A leader who's dying. There will be a miracle. Well, great, great. You go down to Peru, wait for the miracle. I'll take care of things up here. Meyerism is in all of us. That's when there were six members. Now there are 6,000. The last three rungs will tell us what to do. He'll die before they're done, and there is no plan in place. There's nothing. So... I'm writing the last three rungs. That is not your place. Why was it Steve's place in Cusco in 1974? Because The Light came to him. And now it's come to me. That is not the way it works. My hands didn't burn on a story. They burned on a blazing hot Ladder of Truth. I know... no, I know. I know. You're right. Something happened... a miracle that made all this possible, and it is beautiful. It truly is, and it is saving lives. But it has also bought you a very nice five-bedroom house in San Diego. It pays the bills for your four kids, your seven grandkids. No, no. Wait, wait.
