 Previously on "The Path"... 
 We can't move forward until you reveal everything because you're still protecting Miranda Frank. 
 It is not Miranda Frank. 
 I'm gonna recommend 14 days in house, Eddie. 
 They killed my husband when he tried to leave. 
 Okay. 
 They are trying to kill me, and they will kill you. 
 Meyerism people? 
 I'm putting them on cult watch. 
 Aren't they just a bunch of deadheads? 
 I don't think so, sir. 
 Steve has always said that media attention will only bring controversy. 
 You think I'm seizing an opportunity? 
 Are you? 
 [whispering] 
 I'm gonna do the program, Sarah. 
 The 14 days. 
 I just want to set the record straight: 
 Meyerism is not a cult. 
 Oh, no? No, we're a movement. If you follow this way, the path of Meyerism,  someone will reach out to you or you'll reach out to them. One soul at a time... we transform... our broken world... [screaming] Into a place that is whole again. [crying] ♪ ♪ [machines beeping and whirring] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ The scans confirmed what our original blood tests indicated. The tumor just hasn't responded... and whatever optimism we did have... I know Steven doesn't have any next of kin, so we need to find a... ♪ ♪ Power of attorney... Any sign of a will? Now we pray. We summon the healing Light. Don't you think we need to consider a plan in case... If you're not going to pray with us you're of no use here. ♪ ♪ all : Source of Light within us, we pray that you bring healing energy to these vessels, our bodies. Together : That you banish all suffering, and restore us to wholeness. Bringing strength of spirit into our hearts. So that we may ascend The Ladder of Enlightenment together. [door buzzes, opens] ♪ ♪ The truth is, we're all idiots. I mean, we're all... We're all fuck-ups. We hurt people. Even people we... deeply... love. But that is what is so incredible about... this place. There's no shaming here,  You stumble out there and everyone just walks all over you,  but here,  we just simply take your hand and lift you up  because our fuck-ups are just a reminder that we're all human. All right, we're connected. That we are walking together. [applause] Thank you, Eddie. Before we finish, if I could just share one little thing from my time in Peru with Steve. [chuckles] When I told him about the work that you are doing, you should have seen The Light dancing in his eyes. The love and the pride that he feels for you... that's what it's all about. The climb continues, ever closer to The Garden. Soon we will be more than reflections of Light. We will be The Light. [applause] I understand there was a little bump with the inspector, but it sounds like we're back on track. You think we'll get the roofing up before the rains come? I didn't come here to talk about the dorm project. Why haven't I received a report on Miranda Frank's status? Well, if there was anything you needed to know... No, I called Midwest and I was completely stonewalled. Something is going on with her and no one is telling us. She wouldn't unburden. Why? I got the report this morning. There's not much to it. She's denying everything. So... I asked them to bring her here. That's not protocol. If we have a resister, we tell them to go. We don't... Yeah, this isn't about protocol. This is you. I want to give this everything we have. If we just send her off without unburdening that... that could impede your clarity. [cell phone ringing] Uh, one sec. Cal Roberts. Yeah. [door slides open] Yeah. Yeah, I appreciate you letting me know. All right. Thank you very much. Everything okay? Mm-hmm... mm, 10R business. I'm gonna need to take off for the rest of the day. Wait, you're leaving? I have to face her alone? There are other things in this organization that don't involve you. What are non-verbal expressions of power and dominance? Well, in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding so you make yourself big. You stretch out. You take up space. You're basically opening up. It's about opening up, and this is true across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates. Humans do the same thing. So, they do this both when they have power, sort of chronically, and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment, and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are. In primate hierarchies, if an individual needs to take over an alpha role, sort of suddenly, within a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly. So we have this evidence... [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hi, Mom. [soft music] ♪ ♪ [faucet running] [faucet stops] [door opens] Nobody. Thank you. I'm really sorry about all this. Oh, it's fine. I'm up early anyway. I know, but, like, if anyone else knew I was doing this I'd... die, so... Your mom got behind on the power bill. That's not your fault. Why are you so nice to me? [bell rings] I... Yeah, meet me tomorrow after eighth period. I can't. Asher's Field. [indistinct chatter] Welcome. Come right in. Thank you. [gate opens] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ What's your name? Sam. Sam Field. Welcome, Sam Field. Where'd you grow up? All over. Um, military brat. Any previous religious affiliation? Standard issue Christian. [chuckles] I guess, you know, nothing ever really sunk in. Married? Mind saying it out loud for me? [tape recorder clicking] Yeah... yeah. Uh, 15 years. Why the recorder? [chuckles] It has a better memory than I do. Ah. Now, I'm gonna ask you the most important question we have and I want you to try to answer it honestly. In three words. Take all the time you need. Why are you here, Sam? [soft music] ♪ ♪ Curiosity. Pain. Hope. Hey. Thank you so much for meeting up with me. I'm just... I'm hitting dead end after dead end here, and I... when I didn't hear from you for two weeks I... My mind went to the worst, you know, and so... [scoffs] sh1t. What? They got you back, didn't they? Nobody got me anything. This is who I am. I had a momentary slip. You were supposed to get me answers, not drink their f*cking juice! Look, I'm just trying to be a gentleman here. I came here to say that I am committed to my family, okay? To putting my life back together, and I looked up what happened to Jason and he took his own life and I am so sorry. I know the pain that Th... Lies. They tell you a bunch of f*cking lies and you just eat... Stop, stop, stop. It right out of their hands. Okay, I am living The Truth again. Oh, The Truth, really? Yeah. Does your wife know you're here? We're done here. Don't call me again. How do you explain what you saw? How do I explain what I saw? Yes! It was the medicine! Which showed you the truth. Which is why you contacted me. No, no, see, it was the dark... Oh, my God! Tempting me away. There is no dark! No dark! No light! There is only us. There is no us! Okay? Don't... No us! This is over. [tense music] I know you now. You can't hide from that. ♪ ♪ [door buzzes] Finally. I have been asking and asking if I could just talk to you and clear this whole thing up. This is nuts. I didn't do anything and I don't understand... Miranda, if I may. Here in the Meyerist Movement, we don't build cathedrals, because our great edifice, the roof under which we stand, is family. So when someone threatens that with infidelity... This is so weird. It is the ultimate threat to who we are. Denying something over and over. You start to sound guilty... Even feel it. That is why it is so important... No one will believe me, right? Because you're Sarah Lane and I'm just some nobody out of Midwest. No one will believe you because you're not telling the truth. Your family are like the f*cking Kennedys around here. You can do whatever you want. Just let me talk to Eddie. If I could just talk to him. That's fresh juice. You want to drink it before it goes bad. It's the only way it works. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Me... I mean... Well, then talk to her. Oh... [audience rumbles] How long are you gonna keep doing that? When's the last time anyone picked up a broom in this place? When was the last time you were here? Ten years ago? Three, Mom. No, feels a lot longer than that. Five years. Really? I was here for Dad's service. Oh, yeah. I always knew you'd come back. I have an extra room, you know. It's a short visit. Doesn't have to be. So, the building called about the grease fire. No, why don't you have a little drink with me before you start all that, huh? I don't drink. [laughs] You drink. You're just not drinking right now. Mom, you're safety, it's a real... Come here. Come here. Come here. Just... I want to see something. Yeah, just for a moment. He came back to me. You can too. [brushing teeth] [sighs] So, I felt good about today and everything. What about you? I was thinking, uh... maybe we could... connect. Yeah. Yeah, of course. I thought it might help. Oh, that's, uh... always does. All right. [both breathing heavy] Can you feel my energy? Yes. May it flow through us and connect us. May our energy be more powerful than our past because it is our essence, what we feel in this moment, that matters. Eddie... hey, I'm trying to feel something. Oh, I know. It's just... Oh... I miss this. I'm not there yet. Oh, and you see these big containers? Yeah. That is part of our rainwater harvesting system. It's all about capturing natural resources. Caring for the planet. That is a major priority over here. That's great. What's so great is we're training a whole new work force, and new generation, in sustainable technology. So, these kids... the work force... Mm-hmm. Are they the ones from the tornado that I saw on TV? Some of them. We're preparing for when The Future comes. The Future? You have a copy of The Ladder. It explains it all in there. Wow, so do you guys always do that? You know, go in after a disaster? You know, we do what we can, and hope to do more as we grow. Here, I want to show you something. [door opens, toilet flushes] You're up early. How long has your refrigerator been broken? I tried calling. They never came. Oh, so you haven't had any fresh food in what... I'm fine. I eat. What is that? I found a 24-hour vegetarian place nearby. South Indian... You eat that for breakfast? Not much else was open. I had to... Doesn't look too bad, actually. Looks like dog food. It's lentils and rice. You could at least have some plain rice to... To soak things up. [grunts] A little early? Late somewhere. I have no idea how you trick people into joining you. I mean, you live in tents. You eat that... Tents? That was... that was one summer, years ago. We have a beautiful campus now. Mm... your father had you in a tent in the middle of winter... [chuckles] And I was the unfit parent. You know, we're even expanding. I was on the news the other day about... Oh, that's right. Some of our new programs. You're a big shot. No, I'm just saying... I'm just saying I draw a salary. A decent one. Enough to afford a nice place for you. Old folks home. Assisted living. What if I say no? They're gonna kick you out of this place. All right, you want to show me a nice place... Fine. Really? That's great, Mom. One condition: Have a drink with me. I can't do that, and it is horrible that you would ask me to. [scoffs] Fine. I'm not going. I'll stay here. You wanna die on the street? I wanna die here in my own home. [dark music] ♪ ♪ Do you promise you'll go? On your father's grave. ♪ ♪ 
 
 [bourbon pouring] [scoffs] So what happens if you do something that you're, like, not supposed to do, like hanging out with me? Do you get punished? Or is there some sort of public flogging or something? [laughs] No. It's not like that. Nobody whips you. It's more like... I'd whip myself. [laughs] Wait, that's really weird. Literally? No, not literally. Um... I'd just feel really bad. Like... lost and... It's hard to explain to someone outside. Try. Okay, this is gonna sound preachy, but you're asking me, so... Yeah, I want to know. Dr. Steven Meyer, he says the adolescent brain is HS. Hypersensitized. It means vulnerable to... you know. Bad influences. You're not bad. You're just... ignorant. Ignorant? Of the right way to live your life. That's sort of offensive. It's not meant to be. Wait, so when you guys do that weird praying thing... I don't think it's weird. Are you... no, but are you, like, fending off the ignorance? You're, like, protecting yourself from me? I bet you pray too. No, I don't, actually. Really? Even before a test? Or when you're really stressed out about something? You don't go, "Please, please, let this be okay"? Yeah. Or when your dad died. Sorry. That's okay. People just don't really talk about it. That's all. But yeah, I mean, I guess I do that. That's not really praying though. Why not? Because I don't believe in God. Then who are you talking to? The library's only open for a couple more hours. Right, and you still can't. No, um, but hey, if you could, like, pray to get my power turned back on then... I mean, if you could do that, who knows, right? After lunch, our residents turn this into a game room, and after dinner, Alice, our occupational therapist, teaches moonlight Tai Chi. Tai Chi, Ma, that sounds lovely. What about her? She ain't doing any Tai Chi. Mother. She ain't buying any green bananas either. [laughs] Would you be interested in a semi-private apartment or private? Private, definitely. Excellent. I'll just go ahead and get started on the paperwork. Oh, nothing but the best for my son. He runs a cult. No, it's not a cult. Ah, it's okay. They say things. Oh, I'm not demented. If anyone's demented, it's my son. The cult leader. I need you to stop, Ma. Maybe I should just... We're a spiritual movement. That kidnapped a five-year-old boy. No. No one was kidnapped. My dad took me away... And had the sense to leave. He came back to me. And drank himself to death. You were the stubborn one. You stuck with that quack. Please don't call him that. All right, he's the only real parent I ever had. A quack for a quack. Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Make that noise one more time I will let you die like a f*cking dog on the street because that's what you deserve! Mr. Roberts, please! [gasps] [sighs] Why won't she unburden? It makes no sense. Half the world is in denial, Sarah. More than half. Denial is a comfy house, but it's made of glass, and when it shatters... I need to talk to Eddie about it. He's not 7R. Well, neither are you, and neither is Nicole. You know, it really upsets me. Am I the only one that adheres to the system? Hey. [groans] Oh, can I just get a little bit of that? Not with my grandbaby in there. Mom, it's not 1950. It's not gonna kill the baby. No, you're right, Gab, I shouldn't. I've got your casserole dish over there, by the way. Thanks for that. Oh, honey, it was my pleasure. Whatever I can do to help. I can't imagine what you were going through while Eddie was away... I wouldn't have been able to cook. Thanks. If there's anything else that we can do... oh, crap. Those two are always fighting. You two, cut it out! She... [both laugh] She is loving it. Like bringing over those passive-agressive pot pies. She means well, and come on, you've always been the perfect one. [clears throat] How are you guys doing? Eddie's speech yesterday was beautiful. Mm. You still have the walls up. With time you'll feel safer. They'll come down again. You know, catching Daddy was the best thing that ever happened to us. Yeah, I transgressed once. You know that? Yeah, yeah, I know. Marriage is, um... what have you guys been together? Long time... you were kids. Same as with me and Gab. It's hard not to be tempted. New flesh. That's not exactly what, uh... But I get what you're saying. But you feel differently when it happens to your kid, your daughter. Less compassionate. You get it? I mean, you know what it's like when you see pain in your kids' eyes. You'd go to lengths to take that pain away. I do know, Hank. Good. All right, here it comes. I would like to lead the prayer tonight. I think it would be good for me, for my family. I don't have a problem with it. All right. I think we are good here. Let's eat.
