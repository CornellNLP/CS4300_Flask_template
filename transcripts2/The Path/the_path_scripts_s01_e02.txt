 Cal's in charge. 
 He's watching over us while our founder, the Guardian of The Light, Dr. Steven Meyer, he's in Peru transcribing the last three rungs of The Ladder. Everyone has pain, Mary. We just try not to carry it with us. My dad started selling me to his friends when I was 11. Where the f*ck have you been? That's my dad. Ooh! Ever since he got back from Peru, he's been distant. Hello? No, you don't need to know my name. What's your name? You tell me something so I know that this isn't a trap. [cell phone buzzing] Do you have to get that? You having an affair, Eddie? No. Look, this whole thing is just a big mix-up. Who'd you meet at the motel last night? Was the vision of my brother... was it real? I mean, am I going to blow up my life  because of something I don't even know if I really saw? I guess so. [suspenseful music] Do you see The Light? Yes. Is Eddie with you? No. Yes, I am. I'm with you. I am. I see you. Take his hand. Now, I want you to lead him. Lead him to The Truth. Where are you taking me? Back in time. Here. This is where I want to take you. [tranquil music] ♪ ♪ I lost something. I admit it. I stopped wanting you like that. I take responsibility. I do. That's good, Sarah. Sarah accepts her responsibility. It's your turn. Okay. I take responsibility too, but it's over. It is done. I regret it. I just want to move forward. We can't move forward until you reveal everything, because you're still protecting Miranda Frank. It is not Miranda Frank. The Eye sees. The Eye knows. Infidelity is a great affront to The Truth, Eddie. I made a mistake. A horrible, terrible mistake, but people make mistakes. I don't. I'm going to recommend 14 days in-house, Eddie. Why wasn't I enough? You were. Are. Enough. I just want our life back. Then do the 14 days. If you really love us, you will. I love you. I love the kids more than anything, but I won't do 14 days in here. I won't. Stay true to your message. Be positive. Relate to your audience. Now, let's talk about non-verbal techniques we can use to further enhance this connection. Did you know you can use your eyes to speak volumes? Try it. Use your eyes to convey that you are serious. Entertained. Use your eyes to communicate a sea of empathy. And don't forget to smile. However, studies show that people don't react well to men who smile too much. But a well-placed smile can be just what you need to seal the deal. Now, let's talk about... [turns off recording] [calm music] ♪ ♪ [doorbell rings] Cal Roberts. Thank so much for coming. Glad I can be of service. I have lunch on the veranda. You eat lobster? No. Well, there are other options. Is that what I think it is? It is. What is it you do exactly? I operate a hedge fund. Wow, Modigliani. You like art? No. There was a time I used art to deepen my understanding of the human condition, so Francis Bacon revealed a depth of suffering that I couldn't comprehend, or a Dylan ballad helped me get inside what it meant to live as so many of my fellow citizens do: in an existential drift. Now that's the only art I need. The rest is a distraction. [laughs] My wife insisted we hang that thing there. I tell the guests it's a Dali. ♪ ♪ Please, have a seat. Kerry? Split step... Excuse me. I'm starving. Hi. Thank you so much for coming. You know, I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am for the movement. It got me through so much. Sit down, please. How long have you been a follower, Mrs. Ridge? Oh, Kerry, please. Ten years, right, babe? Wouldn't you say? Your mom died in '04, so yeah. Yeah, about ten years. It's been hell. Not my mother. That was hard, but nothing like this. It's our son. He's been in five rehabs. He's not our son anymore. Don't say that. He's lied to us. Stolen from us. And it's not like we did anything wrong. He had everything. Everything. We want him to do your rehab program. I met a woman in a Toward the Light workshop, and she said it changed her life. It's... It's really our last hope. We can definitely help your son. I just want to be discreet. Let's be honest. It's a little cultish for me to be associated with. I'm prepared to make a very large donation for your help in this matter. Hey, again. Hi. What are you studying? I have a calc exam fifth period. Oh, sorry. Am I bothering you? It's okay. My mom and I were at the supermarket this morning, and we heard someone say that you guys, like, brought people into your house from the tornado to, like, help them. Is that true? Yeah. I think it's really great that you did that. Cool. Will you come to my house? What? I want to show you something. I'm not really supposed to hang out with girls like you, like, alone. Right, you can only hang out with girls in your cult? We're not a cult. Yeah, religion. Whatever. It's-movement, yeah, no. Like, how we are right now is fine, but at your house... not really. I just really need someone to see what's happening there, and I don't really know who else to go to, so... All : We express deepest gratitude for this day and every day, for the gift of this passage, and that we have found The Ladder. There is one Spirit whose name is Truth. Come on! Oh, the squash looks so amazing. It's from my garden. You are amazing. I wish I could manage my own garden. You're so busy with more important things. I'm a gardener. It's just who I am. That's why we work. He's a flower. Aw. [laughter] My mother used to say the best relationships have a gardener and a flower. I'm definitely the gardener. What? No, you're not. I'm the gardener. What about you guys? I don't know. A flower. You guys really think I'm a flower? I'm the gardener? Yeah, you're the gardener. I'm more of a weed. You're not a weed. Not a flower. You're a cactus. While you garden me and stuff. Yes, you are. Can I ask a real question? Please. This is the dumbest conversation. Uh, this girl from school asked if I could come to her house. An IS? What does she want? She said there's a problem, and she needs my help. Well, you can't. I also can't refuse someone who asks for help. Okay, Dr. Meyer says tween years are the most vulnerable. I wouldn't be in this situation if my dad would let me leave school, like I want to. It can be a dangerous time, Eddie. But isn't that the point? For him to get through it, so he can learn the skills he needs to deal with the IS? I mean that's what I was taught. He's got everything he needs to start the climb. The Ladder provides the rest. Look how great Sarah and I turned out. Oh, I know, but he'll follow the rules. He'll leave school when he's 16. But Doc would bend the rules for our family. Eddie and I will talk about it later, Dad. And why shouldn't Hawk help this girl? I mean, isn't that the whole point? Help when help is asked for. Bring people to The Light? Okay. You hear Snyder got moved to terrorism? Snyder? There's no way. I swear to you. Snyder's useless. Snyder's a jackass. Hey, Abe, do you hear that? What's that? Snyder got moved to terrorism. Did you guys hear about this tornado that hit New Hampshire? Apparently some religious group showed up in vans two hours before FEMA. I heard FEMA came through this time. Not according to AOL. Hey, is that coffee ready yet? What group was it? Scientologists? No. Didn't say much. You know, some small hippie commune. Meyerist movement. [sirens wail] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Sounds like this boy is going to need months of realignment. He started using when he was 12? Can I just unburden for a second? I know I'm supposed to be above these kind of feelings, but I... I can't stand these hypocritical, fake followers. John Ridge wants us to help his son, but he's ashamed to be associated with us. It's a challenge to put aside our feelings, but it's for the greater good. Yeah, and a big donation. Donation or no donation, you tell this John Ridge I'm going to fix his child. That's how you get someone to believe. What? What, Cal? How's IRP? I don't know. Eddie won't reveal anything. Richard wants him to do the 14 days in-house, and he won't. I'm sorry, Sarah. I know I joke and flirt with you, and I know you have your whole family, but... you know I'm here if you ever... Thank you. It'll all work itself out. We have the tools. Mm-hmm. I have a session. Oh. One more thing. Local news station asked for an interview. Human interest story about us, 'cause we took in the refugees from the tornado. Anyway, wanted to talk to you about it. Oh, you're not thinking about doing it? Yeah. I am. What would Steve say? I think he'd say, "Do it." I doubt that. Hi, Mary. Why don't we talk about it later? I'll leave you to your meeting. How are you, Mary? I'm so good. You heading out with the novices later? Yeah. I want to join or whatever. I like your passion, Mary. It's a little more complicated than that. To start, you'll have to commit to 500 hours community service, first run workshops, and then you can take your vows. Okay. Or you can choose to incorporate our practices into your daily life in the regular world. Study your texts. Go to the workshops. You just have to really believe this is your path, to take your vows. This is my path. That's great to hear, Mary. Okay, why don't we go into my office, and we can talk about it? Yeah? Hey, so these Meyerism people. Meyerism people? Yes, sir. The ones that got to Rindge after the tornado, before FEMA. No one got to Rindge before FEMA. Okay, so the Meyerism people that got there after FEMA and took some of the storm refugees back to their camp in upstate New York. What about 'em? Some of the refugees aren't responding to messages from their families. I'm concerned, and I'm putting them on cult watch. Aren't they just a bunch of Dead Heads? I don't think so, sir. We can see the ones in need. The lost ones, the ones in so much pain they wear it on their faces. The ones who long for truth, How do we get her to come over here? Maybe you have to go to her. Come with me? Okay. Beautiful kids. Hi. Sorry to bother you. We saw that you were sitting by yourself. I'm not interested. Okay, well, if you change your mind... Sean. Sean Egan. I won't. Mary Cox from New Hampshire. Just saying I'm not, like, a city person or anything. Oh, no. Me neither. Washington state. Where in Washington? I'm from outside Olympia. Marysville. Where the shooting... My sister. Was killed? My twin. I didn't know that. I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. It's good to say out loud. My twin sister Sheila was killed by our classmate at school. I'm so sorry. My parents can't say it. How do you keep on going after that? Well, my parents don't. They're like zombies. Meyerism helped me. It helped me take all of the anger and the sadness and put it behind me so that I can do good in the world. [quiet music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Hey. You scared the sh1t out of me. Sorry. You look like sh1t. My... my wife. She followed me to the hotel the other night. She thinks I'm having an affair. f*ck. Yeah, I'm in the IRP, Infidelity Rehab Program. Yeah, I know what it is. They want me to do 14 days in-house. Are you f*cking kidding me? Sorry, man. It's not funny. I mean when you're in it, it makes so much sense, but once you're out it's like... pow. How the hell am I going to do 14 days? I'll go insane. I mean, I'll give up names that don't even exist or worse I'll tell the truth. Look. I don't think I can do this anymore. What? Maybe it doesn't matter if it's real or not. So what if there's no Light, you know? Are you f*cking kidding me? Of course it matters. The truth has to matter. That's why you joined the movement in the first place. That's why you're here right now, because it f*cking matters. Yeah, but my wife. My family. I would die without them. Yeah, but you can live in a faith you know is a lie? First of all, I don't... I don't know that it's a lie. And second, isn't that what the whole f*cking rest of the world does? They killed my husband when he tried to leave! They are trying to kill me, and they will kill you. There is no room for doubt. What are you talking about? Nobody has killed anyone. Yeah, well, if you really believe that, then why are you so afraid? Six months ago, they killed my husband in Peru when he said he was done. I have spent the last three months scraping together $400 to escape San Diego. I bought a crap car. Managed to get it across the country. I just wanted to go home. I wanted to see my grandparents. I haven't seen them in 16 years, but when I got there they were waiting for me. They knew where to find me. I've got nothing. I've got no home. No bank account. I'm living like a fugitive. My only hope is to find others. Others like me. Ones like you. Hey, no, no, no. I'm not like you. I'm not. I don't know about this. Jason Kemp. My husband's name was Jason Kemp. Please. Please! Please listen to me! [tense music] ♪ ♪ Try it. We don't really eat meat. Who is "we"? My parents. Oh. What are they, hippies or something? Sort of. Well, Ashley should have told me she was bringing a friend home for dinner. I would have cooked something different. No, thank you. It's fine. I like the vegetables. Where's your dad? Oh, he died, hon. Last year. I'm sorry. How did he die? Okay, just take, like, one bite. You're so bad, Ash. He doesn't eat meat. You shouldn't force him. Yeah, but you have to, like, try steak at least once in your life. Yeah, it's really good. It is really good. I'm a great cook. If you're going to eat it this is the way to go, right? Organic grass-fed. Okay. I'll try some. No pressure, though. Yeah. What do you think? It's good. Really? You like it? Mm-hmm. You want more? No. [laughter] 
 
 Well, I got to clean up and get this one started on his homework. Oh, can... What? The door. Could we open it? One sec. Did your dad die in a bad way? What's wrong with you? What? You ask, like, really personal questions. Oh, sorry. We're taught to just say what we think. Otherwise we get burdened. Like, weighted down. It was drunk driving. Oh. Yeah, my mom doesn't really like people to know. Talk about weighted down. My mom doesn't like anyone to know anything, and now we're screwed. Found all these in the trash. She hasn't paid the mortgage in, like, four months. Now they're going to take our house away, and I tried to talk to her about it too. I, like, brought these to her, and she completely freaked out and started, like, yelling at me. She was like, "This isn't any of your business." Like, refused to hear me. Sorry. You helped all those people in the tornado. Sorry. It's stupid. [sniffling] We shouldn't still be doing this. What's that? My father had me out there when I was five years old handing out fliers. Well, your dad was a good man. You ever talk to your mom? Uhuh. People used to spit at me. Someone even called Child Services. Terrible. You want some? No? Things need to change. The pot? Yeah, that too. The pot. The medicine, the flyers. The media blackout. That was the '70s. This is a new time. People need us. Look! Look at all the need out there, and we can reach them. But those who need The Ladder find The Ladder. Not with us on the street corners like Jews for Jesus. We have to be realistic. If the people could hear what we're about, they would flock to us. Can you imagine? The whole world lived as we do? We could achieve world peace. Yeah. Yeah, I think we're done for the day. Hi. You're late. Yeah. Sorry. It's just a rough day, and I got behind. Is Summer asleep? Where's Hawk? You told him he could go to a girl's house. I guess he's still at a girl's house. Sarah. How are we going to get through this? The program. That's how. It's 14 days. It's there for a reason... So I do it, and you suddenly forgive me? Yes. I don't get how me sitting in a cell, getting my bio realigned, telling the nitty-gritty of my life is going to make it better. Because it's designed to make it better. And your pain will just go away? We have to try. You know, you said you never made a mistake, but maybe you did. Me. Come on. No. Everyone knew it. That's not true. I was a wild card. You have no idea what you're talking about. Hey. No. Why? Why did you, perfect Sarah, want me? Huh? You knew that this would happen somewhere along the way. I would f*ck up. Let me go. No. I want to know. I want to know what I am fighting for. That is why. That is why I fell in love with you. What? Because I'm a f*ck up? No. Because we're all the same. Me and my family. All of us. But you, I don't know. You're different, like a window, and I saw the world differently through you. Stop. No. No! [whimpers] Let's go to the bedroom. [both whimpering and moaning] I am so mad at you. [both gasping and grunting] Mom, Dad? You guys up here? Need to talk to you guys. [gasping and whimpering] How could you do this with someone else?

What'd she need help with? Nothing. Nothing? It was dumb. I'm going to walk to school. Are you sure? Everything okay? Hawk? [door slamming] It's a ten-minute human interest piece that the 15 people who watch the local news will see. Steve has always said that media attention will only bring controversy and ire to the purity of our movement. I was with him right before he went into lockdown writing, and he said to me, "The time has come when the message will bring us love." Like, he literally said that to me, Sarah. I need to hear it from him directly. Unfortunately that isn't possible. Sarah, Cal just opened his heart to you, and I feel like you didn't open yours. Now, I know things are rough at home, but... What does this have to do with my marriage, Dad? Come on, honey. Mom and I talk. We talk to Richard. Oh, great. You talk to my guide. All of these burdens on you guys... I think it's closing you off from your work. That is absolutely not true. Hank, Hank, please. Look, Sarah, I know you know me. Yes. I do know you, Cal. You think I'm seizing an opportunity? Are you? Yes. Yes. That's why Steve wanted me here, 'cause he saw this coming, the need to reach people. And what we did in Rindge... It did that. It moved people. [sighs] It's time, it's time for us to step out of the shadows. Come on. We all want that. I'm not as high up on The Ladder as you guys, but when I look to the light, I just... I feel it. It's time. Let the people know who we are finally. Let 'em know. Hey. Don't, like, tell anyone about what I told you, okay? I'm just, like, really freaked out about the whole situation, and they could, like, take our house away any day now, so... Isn't there someone you can talk to? Yeah, I'm talking to you. I can't... What's going on? I heard you had Jim Jones over at your house last night. Who told you that? Carrie Adams. Bitch. Hey, don't you walk away, coward. Hey, leave him alone. Bev, just let him go. Hey, hey. You keep your Kool-Aid away from my girlfriend, freak. Oh, my God. [students reacting] Oh, my gosh. Oh! Guys, stop it! [all cheering] [all cheering] Hey, Gav. Hey, Eddie. How's it going? It's good. It's good. I was just wondering if I could look someone up in the system. Oh, sure. Who's that? You mind if I do it? It's just someone who used to be one of us that isn't anymore. I can do it for you. Okay. Great. Thank you. His name is Jason. Jason Kemp. Oh. What? The poor thing. It's awful. He killed himself. [cell phone ringing] Does it say how? Hello? Yeah, this is him.

It is bad, 'cause you do one thing, and you think it's just a little thing, and it's not that bad. And the next thing you know everything's out of control, and I just want the world back in control. Okay, hey, Hawk, slow down. What happened, Dad? What? You were going to let me leave this stupid place until you went on your retreat. I think you did something there. Something bad with someone. Someone who wasn't Mom. Who told you that? Nobody. Nobody had to tell me. I listen. I can hear the truth. Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I love you guys, and I would never do anything to hurt you. Well, you did hurt us. I know you hurt Mom, and you really hurt me, and now, God, everything's just messed up and confusing, and I just want everything back the way it used to be. And you should let me leave school. You shouldn't make me stay here because of your mistake. [quiet music] ♪ ♪ Hello? Mary? What are you doing here? Looking for you. Oh. Hope you're not mad. No. What are you doing here? Thinking.

Is that right? Our founder is The Guardian. You can just call me... Responsible for East Coast. All right. Take it back. Today I'm talking to Calvin Roberts, responsible for the East Coast Meyerist movement, a little-known cult whose headquarters are situated in upstate New York. Excuse me. If I can just interrupt. First, I want to thank you so much for having me, and second, I just want to set the record straight. Meyerism is not a cult. Oh, no? No, we're a movement. A movement of people with a very simple vision to be everything God intended when He created us in His image, so we believe that by achieving personal enlightenment, or Truth, we can achieve universal enlightenment, universal Truth. I know, I know. It sounds a little idealistic, but the great triumphs of the centuries were achieved by the idealism of individuals, so we aim to be Light and eradicate the world's suffering. That's a tall order. The world is full of suffering. I mean, I wouldn't even know where to begin to do... Well, no. No, that's why so many don't begin, because you're right. It's just... It's too overwhelming, and that's why we train ourselves to listen... Because if you listen very closely, you will hear the souls calling out for help. And you will find that some of them are in your backyard,  and maybe if you listen even more closely you'll find that the soul in need of care is your own. And then if you follow this way, the path of Meyerism, someone'll reach out to you, or you'll reach out to them, and you will have started. One soul at a time, and then who knows? But perhaps one soul at a time we transform our broken, broken world into a place that is whole again. Well, that sounds... Sign me up. [quiet piano music] ♪ ♪ Cal. Wow. Amazing interview.
