 Eddie : Previously on "The Path"... 
 Eddie Lane? 
 Chloe. It's Chloe Jones. 
 Hey, it was great to see you the other day. 
 Bidding will begin on the building at 899 Bradbush. 
 Do I hear 3.5 million? 
 4.8, I have 4.8. 
 No, okay, just leave it at that, please. 
 You're not gonna believe this. 
 What did he buy it for? 
 Five. 
 How could you let this happen? 
 Mary : I'm not a good person. 
 Cal : You're pregnant. How far along? 
 About five months. 
 I have learned to live with most of your lies, but I won't accept your story about Silas. 
 [screams] 
 You, you're the son. 
 Man : Who was this? 
 Eddie : The man who killed Steve. 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 [shower running] 
 Richard : What do you see? 
 Sarah : A body. 
 [ominous music] 
 Mangled. 
 Innocent. 
 Richard : What are you feeling now? 
 Sarah : Cold. 
 Frightened. 
 Richard : Can you tell me where that lives, in your body? 
 Sarah : In my hands. 
 They're shaking so bad, and I don't know what to do. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Richard : Stay with that. 
 Your hands. 
 Sarah : I bury it. 
 I put its body in the hole. 
 Head pointing east to receive the sunrise, as is our custom. 
 It's the only way. 
 But the weight of it. 
 Richard : Can you locate that? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Sarah : In my chest. 
 My heart. 
 Are you available for me to share an opinion now? 
 Yes. 
 Your empathy for the animal is real. 
 But I'm intuiting some leakage from the damage of your break-up. 
 Not everything has to do with my split from Eddie. 
 And what about his trip to Peru? 
 After your split? 
 That must have stirred things up. 
 Were you aware of his trip to Peru? 
 Eddie didn't go to Peru. 
 Maybe I'm mistaken. It was something I heard. 
 I don't understand. 
 Who would say that? 
 One of the locals described seeing someone. 
 I thought it might be him. 
 It wasn't. 
 If Eddie went to Peru, I would know about it. 
 Are you speaking with him? 
 Of course not. 
 Eddie's a Denier. 
 Deniers are shunned. 
 That's our way. 
 We can get ice cream? 
 You just had a snow cone. 
 It's hot. 
 You want to be as pumped full of sugar and chemicals as the rest of these I. S. kids? 
 Hey, maybe later, sweetie, all right? 
 [kiss] 
 Maybe you should have an ice cream. 
 You haven't eaten anything all day. 
 I'm fasting. My AL retreat's this week. 
 Wow. 
 You're moving along. 
 It's not a competition, Dad. 
 We all walk together. 
 [sighs] 
 They won't tell us what happens on it. 
 Yeah, how it works. 
 Dad. 
 Dad, come here. 
 Eddie : Yeah? 
 Please? 
 Oh, you want that? 
 Oh, all right. 
 Um. 
 But you got to promise you're not gonna ask me for anything else for the rest of the day, okay? 
 I promise. 
 Okay. 
 You're the best dad in the whole world. 
 You're the best. 
 All right, here you go. Thank you. 
 Summer. 
 Here you go. 
 [ominous music] 
 Oh, you know what? Uh... 
 We should actually probably get going. 
 I didn't realize how late it was. 
 We don't want to miss the train, come on. 
 Come on, kid. 
 Abe : They're increasing their presence in the city. 
 Not just with bodies, but with real estate. 
 They're buying property in the city? 
 They grabbed a building in Canarsie at an auction through a holding company that we were able to link to Cal Roberts. 
 This is the new leader? 
 Yes. 
 He's become the focus of my investigation. 
 It's not a federal crime to buy real estate. 
 It's just smart. 
 We know that this man is capable of violent assault. 
 We suspect he's capable of murder, but we can't get him on any of that. 
 Right, so we'll go after him on the financial side. 
 Easier to track. 
 He just filed an application for tax-exempt status with the IRS. 
 Of course. As a religion. 
 Right. 
 Well, if that goes through, he'll be hard to stop. 
 But if it doesn't, we put him up against a wall, we force him into financial impropriety. 
 And with his ego, with his arrogance... 
 Oh, but we can't let it go through, can we? 
 I'll contact our friends over in Internal Revenue. 
 I appreciate that. 
 You can count on the full support of the US Attorney's Office. 
 And me, personally, I consider this a huge priority. 
 You're a sharp guy. 
 It's a shame you let the Bureau keep you in the basement for so long. 
 Yes, it is. 
 I love you so much, kiddo. 
 You too, Dad. 
 Fiercely and forever. 
 Fiercely and forever. 
 Eddie : Hey, uh, thank you for, uh... 
 Hey. 
 Are you, uh... 
 Is everything all right? 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. I'm fine. 
 You don't look fine. 
 Sarah, come on. 
 What's going on? 
 Just, um... 
 Had a session with Richard, so. 
 You know, it stirred things up. 
 Okay. 
 What... what things? 
 What is it? 
 [somber music] 
 I can't. 
 Eddie. 
 Yes, you can. Come on. 
 What? Hey, what? 
 No, this. 
 This is. 
 Okay? We're standing in the middle of a f*cking park, exchanging our kids like it's a drug deal. 
 And I am supposed to be running things. 
 I am a Guardian of The Light, but instead this is happening. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Isn't this enough? 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey, Sarah. 
 [stifled cry] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Lisa : Good morning, Cal. 
 It's Lisa Jackson. 
 I'm so sorry to be calling with, uh, not-so-good news. 
 But I'll go ahead and just rip off the Band-Aid. 
 Uh, I'm afraid your application for tax-exempt status has hit a bump, well, uh, more than a bump. 
 It's going to be, uh... more complicated than I thought. 
 I'm sorry if I overpromised, but they're telling me it's a no-go. 
 Okay. Uh, hope you're great. 
 Um, bye then. 
 [line hangs up] 
 Aren't you busy in the city? 
 I... yeah, I needed to see you. 
 Um... 
 How are you? 
 I don't know. 
 I had an unburdening session with Richard. 
 And of course, it was incomplete. 
 I wanted to tell him everything. 
 Well, yes. That... that impulse is... it's understandable, but to act on it would be catastrophic. 
 You know that. 
 Every time I close my eyes, I relive it. 
 Our tax-exempt status was denied. 
 You said that you were sure, that it was all but approved. 
 No, it... it was... it was supposed to be. 
 Um, it's religious discrimination is what it is. Jesus Christ. 
 And we will fight... 
 This is why Steven said never to get involved with the government. 
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
 I told you this. 
 Steve may have been right, and... and you may have been right. 
 But in the meantime, the... the money situation, uh... is critical. 
 How critical? 
 Um... 
 Kerry Ridge is throwing together a fundraiser in the city. 
 A flashy thing. 
 You know, all her rich friends. 
 Uh... 
 We need it. 
 And I need you there. 
 No. 
 I am not good at these things, and especially not now. 
 I know you are suffering. 
 But we... we have to put the needs of The Movement above our needs. 
 We... we... we have a responsibility. 
 You're talking to me about responsibility? 
 They will turn the lights off. 
 They will take the compound. 
 That is... that... that is how critical it is. 
 [dark music] 
 Please. 
 I can't. 
 Please.

 [startles] 
 [dark music] 
 ♪ ♪ [inhales] Once you decide on a size, then we, uh, got to start looking at 4K, HDR, Rec 2020... [TV chatter blends] [voice distorting] If you're going for that cinematic experience, I suggest the one that's in front of you, sir. 1216... [voices dull, blur] Smart TV. So it has a 4K resolution... [extremely slow-motion] Totally sharp... [indistinct voices] [speaking Spanish] [slow-motion] Or playing games with it... [dull electronic feedback] [aggressive whistling] [white noise builds] Stop! [sound normalizes] I'm sorry, I... sorry. Just trying to get a TV for my kids, and I... just been away for so long, and... there are so many choices. I didn't realize that, uh... You were... you were locked up? Uh... No, it wasn't, wasn't... My uncle was locked up for 30 years. Well, actually, yeah. Kinda, I guess. That's pretty much it. [inhales] Are you sure about this? No problem. Are you kidding? Take them off my hands, please. I'm not doing this anymore. Oh, I love you, but Mommy is done. I only need one. Nothing fits me anymore. Oh, that's nice on you. I like it. Yeah. I just don't know if it's appropriate. Never been to a fancy fundraiser before. What are you wearing? Uh, we're not going. I'm in charge of the AL retreat tonight, so... [clicks tongue] No can do. Yeah, also, we weren't invited. So Russel is stuck babysitting the 1Rs on their camp-out, and I'm stuck babysitting everybody else. It's not babysitting, it's awesome. You'll get just as much out of it as the 1Rs do. All right, sweetheart. I know, I know. I know, buddy. There you go. Sorry. It's just, that's the craziest thing. I know. When you haven't done it before, it's like magic what the body can do. You forget. Can I ask you something? Sure. Your kids, you're... you're a mixed race. Um... Do the kids look... I don't know how to say it. Um... Asian? You can say it. Now, just don't say "oriental" 'cause that's for rugs, not people. I know they... they all have a different mix of us. And this one, she's all Russel. [dark music] Hank : Holy cow. You look like a movie star. It's just a dress. Has anybody seen my daughter? I swear she went upstairs a few minutes ago and then this femme fatale appeared. You're embarrassing me. Is it too much? I was wondering about the hair. I love the hair. You look gorgeous. Don't sweat it. I just want to feel like myself. You always look gorgeous to me, honey. No matter what you're wearing. [phone ringing] Um... I'm gonna take this outside. ♪ ♪ What are you doing? My parents are just inside. Are you... you going somewhere? It's work. There's a fundraiser in the city. Uh-huh. You going with Cal? What do you want, Eddie? Look, I was worried about you. You seemed off to me. But clearly, you are fine. Right? I mean, you're more than fine. I am sorry. In my session with Richard... What? What are you saying to him about us? Did you go to Peru? What? Richard said that there's talk that you were there. Richard is a goddamn liar. I shouldn't have come here. Have a good night. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [engine turns over] ♪ ♪ Russel : You've heard a lot about light in The Movement. The Light is what we strive for, what we aspire to bring to the world. Light's pretty much our favorite metaphor around here. [chuckles] But light isn't just a figure of speech we Meyerists happen to like. It's a material thing. A necessity, light is what we rely upon to move through the world. Without it, we lose our bearings. And we can even lose our minds. The truth is, we can't always count on light to be there for us, to soften the corners of our dangerous world. But tonight, the big secret of the AL is finally out. Tonight, on the darkest night of the year, the dead moon, I will need your matches, your flashlights, your lanterns, your candles, anything you might have brought with you to give you warmth or light, to ease your journey. Tonight, you'll have to find the light inside of you. Good luck. And I'll see you on the other side. [douses fire] Kerry : These are the people who saved my son's life. They are angels on Earth. [polite chuckle] Our practices are very effective in combating addiction. Mm. Mary here was heavily addicted when she joined us. Exploited and abused, now she's clean and stable thanks to our program. And the love of my husband. Still a struggle though. Ah, it's a one-day-at-a-time thing. Mm. Well, we're also, uh, heavily involved in social justice issues. Uh, right here in the city, we have an epidemic of homelessness. Now, some of that is connected to mental illness, but an awful lot of it is simply lack of access to things the rest of us take for granted. Oh. Thank God. I was dying for a drink. Oh, me too. No, thank you. I'll have one, thank you. If you don't mind. Yes, as I was saying, uh... Chloe : I'm so happy you finally called me, eventually. Eddie : Yeah, you know, it's just, uh... it's pretty busy, and... and with the kids, it's just... Yeah. Well, I was starting to think that maybe I was coming on a little too strong. Oh, no, no, no, no. Something like, I was too forward or something. No. It wasn't that. Good. And then I thought you, maybe, uh... you thought it would be a little weird because I was with your brother, and... I mean, we were so young, you know, we were just kids, but I wasn't sure if you... I mean... hone... Honestly, everything feels a little weird. Um... But it's nice to do something that feels right. And calling you up felt right. Yeah? [laughs softly] [elegant music playing] You know, imagine not being able to drink water from your own tap, you know, not being able to bathe your children in it. It's terrible. Just terrible. I can't imagine. I don't want to. We were able to bring safe water directly to the residents of Clarksville, but hopefully that's just the beginning. We want to be advocates for a long-term solution. But that's gonna require more resources. Suzanne, Matthew, I'm so glad you could come. Sarah. Listen, I have a question for you. You are exquisite. How is it we've never met before? Been to a lot of these functions. I've already told you, it's a no. And it will be all night. [breathing] 
 
 [music and chatter] Excuse me. Hi. Hi, it seems to be getting pretty late. Yeah. Yeah, I'm wondering, when we should get to the ask. I'm sorry? Asking for contributions. Everyone seems to be gathered... Oh, no, we weren't going to do an ask tonight. This is more of, um... more of a friend-raiser than a fundraiser. I'm sorry? Trust me, you don't want to seem desperate with this crowd. It'll only scare them off. [both chuckle] [music and chatter continue] ♪ ♪ Noa : Where are we? Hawk : We're not that far. It's just like... steps. Noa : But how do you know that? We can't see sh1t. We could be anywhere. This is a nightmare. [dog howls distantly] What was that? Hawk : Nothing. A... far away... a... a dog? Noa : That's not a dog. [shrieks] It's a f*cking spider... get it off me! Hawk : No, it's not... it's not... it's not a spider. It's not a spider. We have to use our other senses, like... like touch. It's just a branch, see? Noa : I can't f*cking see anything. Hawk : I meant feel. [Zippo flicks] What are you doing? That... that's cheating. I can't do the dark. [sighs] That's... that's why... [dog howls distantly] We do this. Darkness is the scariest thing. That's no reason to give up on ourselves. I'm not like you, Hawk. What does that mean? You were brought up here, in this loving circle of paradise. When I was eight years old, my mom used to leave me with a German Shepherd as a babysitter for days. She would say, "If something happens, you know where I keep the gun." That's really horrible. It was fine in the day, but at night... So I'm sorry, but I'm terrified. I'm... I'm... terrified too. No, you're not. This is like your DNA. [laughs] No. No, I'm completely freaked out. I mean, nothing in my life makes sense anymore. My parents are a mess. Everything's just ripped apart. I...found someone that I loved and I lost her. And I just thought that this night would... I don't know, being out here in the dark...

You know, I get to... I get to work with my hands. It's simple work. Mm. I... uh, watch something go up. Yeah, Johnny did construction, didn't he? Yeah, our old man taught us. Yeah, he could build a house from studs. He could put in everything from electrical to plumbing. You know, until the... the drinking got bad, but... um, yeah, you know. Still getting back into the swing of it, but, yeah, it's nice. Right. There's a couple things that I'm dying to ask you. Go ahead. What? Okay, um... In your, like, movement, the thing... Mmhmm. Did you have any, like, rituals that you had to do, like, any, like, s*x stuff or anything? I mean, it was a religious, uh, community. It wasn't... wasn't that weird. Hm. Well, the girls at the salon told me that there was this group that if you disobeyed their leader, he'd make you lick the floor with your tongue. So, I mean, it's no wonder you'd get a little...

Is that what this is? You... Are you trying to find dirt on me so you can trade it at the salon? I mean... No. What? Absolutely not, Eddie, no. What is it then? No, I... [sighs] I just... I want to know what you've gone through, you know? [sighs] Yeah. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. No, it's... [unfolds cash] What are you doing? I'm not gonna be your sideshow.

Listen, I can't explain the world I was in, okay? I know it's different. It always will be. You don't have to explain it to me, okay? Look, after Johnny died... No, can we please not do this? I don't want to do this. Listen to me. Eddie, listen to me, please. When Johnny died, I had nothing. I had no answers as to why it happened. I had no one, I just... I had nowhere to go. And you? You found somewhere to go. I mean, you... you found a place that has the answers that you need, you know? It probably saved your life. [somber music] Yeah. It did. Yeah. Who's gonna judge you for that, huh? Not me. It... they, uh... did save me. And it was beautiful for so long to have a story that just contained it. You know, it just held it all.

[clears throat] Ladies and gentlemen, please. [chuckles] Now, don't worry, you can all go back to drinking and complaining about the commute to your summer homes in just a second. [forced chuckle] I want to talk to you for just a moment about the purpose of this evening, why you're here, other than the fact that someone you consider socially desirable invited you. Half a mile from here in Canarsie, there are 30 young Novices sleeping on a concrete floor, dedicating themselves to the social mission of our movement. They are sacrificing and slaving to make a haven for the homeless of this city, the sick, the disabled, the forgotten, uh... people you walk past every day in the street and avert your eyes. We are intervening, making a difference, uh, saving lives. It takes conscience. It takes commitment. An unwillingness to turn away. That's why I'm asking you right now, all of you, to reach into your pockets and give. Give deeply. Um... Consider... consider how little that money means to you. It's another status handbag, some obscenely expensive bottle of wine you buy and show off at a dinner party. To the people we're helping, it could mean the difference between life and death.
