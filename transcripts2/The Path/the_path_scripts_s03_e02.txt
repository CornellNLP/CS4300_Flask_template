 Previously, on "The Path"... 
 Why did you leave right after the explosion? 
 Eddie wasn't gonna kick you out. 
 ‐ I couldn't stick around and play second fiddle to God. 
 ‐ That workshop, if I didn't take it in, I'd be so f*cked. ‐ Well, you did take it and you have me now, 24 hours service. 
 ‐ Saul, book his ticket for the graduation. 
 ‐ It says here your father is the pastor of the biggest church in Westchester. 
 ‐ Yeah. ‐ Why apply to use our interfaith space? ‐ I'm looking to kind of individuate from my dad and his word. ‐ Vera Stephens. 
 ‐ The publicist. ‐ I see you on the cover of "The Sunday Times Magazine." 
 The new face of faith. 
 ‐ I have decided to take down the guard booth. ‐ Something tried to break in last night. ‐ What are you gonna do about whatever it is that did this? 
 Every morning I wake up, the first thing that I see is Mark Fuller taking his life in my foyer. 
 Do you know anything about the HC? 
 ‐ Hello? Hey, who's out there? 
 Just come out. 
 Source of light. 
 I need your strength. 
 Righteous and good. 
 Shine through me. 
 Make me a vessel. 
 So that I may bring strength, hope and guidance to all of those in your embrace. 
 If darkness falls, make me a light. 
 When darkness falls, make me a light. 
 There's something special about Eddie. 
 There's a real confidence in him without arrogance. 
 It's a humble, sincere kind of leadership and people really respond to it. 
 I think he has tremendous potential. 
 ‐ And he's still married, right? 
 ‐ Separated, but technically. 
 ‐ What about you and Julian? 
 ‐ What about us? 
 ‐ Are you still intimate with each other? 
 ‐ Mom, does this have to be the conversation we have right now? ‐ There is no judgment. 
 Expend that s*x drive... ‐ Oh! Okay. 
 ‐ While you still have it. ‐ Thank you, Mom. 
 ‐ But, I mean, we have worked hard for our autonomy. 
 ‐ I know. ‐ Emotional attachments, they don't go well for you, do they? 
 ‐ Did you ever call Dr. Michaels for that eye pain? 
 ‐ I don't need Dr. Michaels with his arrogance and his chemicals. 
 I've got my own methods. 
 ‐ Do you still see the spots? 
 ‐ Rarely. Almost never. 
 ‐ That is not good enough. 
 I've looked this up and it could be very serious and I've told you that. ‐ And I know when it's time to worry. ‐ Ma, there are limits. 
 There are limits even to autonomy. 
 There has to be. ‐ Shh. 
 Oh. Poor little thing. 
 May your pain and suffering be transcended. 
 ‐ Transcended, becoming life and strength for another. 
 For many, we are one. 
 ‐ Morning, Mom. 
 ‐ Morning. 
 ‐ You slept in. ‐ I did. 
 I guess I needed it, huh? 
 ‐ Mom? 
 What are you doing? 
 ‐ I think it's time for someone to come fix this. 
 ‐ But this is where the man came and spread his damage. 
 I thought it was important to keep as a reminder. 
 ‐ Yeah, but it's been offset, now. 
 ‐ How? 
 ‐ Through prayer and ritual, as we always do. 
 We can make this space whole again. 
 ‐ You all right there, buddy? 
 ‐ Oh, yeah, fine. 
 ‐ Can't thank you enough, man. 
 If I hadn't shown up for that graduation, my kids would've hated me. 
 And I would've hated myself. 
 ‐ It's all right. It's my job. 
 ‐ But you saved me. 
 ‐ You did that. 
 Say it. 
 ‐ I did that. 
 ‐ Good. 
 Go get some rest and I'll see you at the big opening, all right? 
 ‐ Hey. How was the trip? 
 Did you meet the ex‐wife? ‐ What about the twins? 
 Did you meet them? I'm dying to know. 
 ‐ Yeah, yeah. They were fine, um... 
 Yeah, it was all fine. 
 ‐ Right. 
 Are you okay? 
 Did something happen on the trip? 
 Was Harold drinking again? I mean, did he get violent? 
 ‐ No. Uh, no, no, no. 
 He was a... he was a good boy. 
 Did as he was told. 
 ‐ Well, then what is it, 'cause, um... 
 I don't know, you're being... weird. 
 ‐ Um... 
 I just, um... 
 I just missed you. 
 ‐ You did? 
 ‐ 
 Uh! 
 ‐ 
 ‐ So the woman turns to me and said, "You saw The Lights. 
 Can you make me see it?" 
 And I said, "No, I can't. I can't make you see it. 
 I can't make anyone see The Light." 
 I can't make anyone believe. 
 Maybe not the best thing for someone who's running a religious movement to say. 
 I mean, right? Definitely not what priests I grew up with said. 
 I'm here to share with you my experience. 
 Help guide you on your own journey to Light, to transcendence. 
 Get off me! 
 I'm not going anywhere with you! 
 ‐ Excuse me a sec. 
 ‐ You're going... ‐ Stop it. Just leave me alone. 
 You can't do this. You can't come and yank me out of here. 
 ‐ You don't tell us what to do. ‐ You have no right! 
 ‐ Hey, hey, hey, hey. ‐ We say you're leaving now! 
 ‐ Sweetheart, please. Mommy and Daddy love you. 
 Come home. ‐ Sir, ma'am, can we help you? 
 ‐ We won't let you waste your life here. 
 ‐ What life? I didn't have a life before. 
 Those were your dreams. I was dying! 
 ‐ Sweetheart, please. I'm so sorry. 
 We'll do anything, just come back home. 
 ‐ Stop begging her! She is our child. 
 ‐ I'm 19! I'm a grown woman! 
 ‐ Sir... sir, I need you to calm down. 
 All right? This is a peaceful place. 
 ‐ Get the f*ck out of my way! 
 ‐ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop, stop, stop. 
 No need to hurt anyone, all right? 
 Let him go. It's fine, it's fine. 
 My name is Eddie Lane, and I'm in charge here. 
 Okay? I think we just need to take a deep breath, find a quiet place to talk. 
 I think cooler heads are in order. All right? 
 ‐ So you're the leader, huh? 
 What do you do? 
 Do you drug them? 
 Do you rape them? ‐ Daddy, stop! 
 ‐ None of that is happening here. 
 ‐ Do you use them for your child s*x slaves? 
 ‐ Sir? ‐ No one is hurting your daughter, I promise. 
 ‐ You lying piece of sh1t! ‐ Hey, sir! 
 ‐ Get him out of here. Get him out of here. 
 ‐ Monica! Come on, Monica! ‐ Please, come home! 
 ‐ Let me go! ‐ 
 ‐ 
 ‐ The show's over, okay? 
 Have some respect. 
 ‐ Hey. 
 ‐ Hey, what are you doing down here? 
 ‐ I have a meeting with Vera. 
 ‐ Oh. 
 ‐ Yeah, it's nice to see you too. 
 ‐ I'm sorry, it's just... a lot going on today. 
 It's good to see you here. Really. 
 ‐ Do you still plan on going to Summer's parent‐teacher night? ‐ Yeah, of course. 
 Should we just meet there, or? ‐ No, no, no. 
 Meet... meet us at my place. 
 We'll go together. 
 I think it'll be better for Summer. 
 ‐ Okay. 
 ‐ As you know, things are changing around here under Eddie's leadership. 
 New projects, new approaches. 
 ‐ Change is always a good thing. 
 You know, ever evolving. 
 ‐ Well, I'm glad you think so because there's one project in particular that I'd love for you to be involved in. 
 That... that is if you're feeling up to it. 
 I know things haven't been easy for you since the tragedy. 
 ‐ I... I'm feeling much better, actually. 
 ‐ Great. 
 So as you know, I've been tasked with outreach. 
 And one group we're particularly interested in is millennials. ‐ Okay. 
 ‐ Yeah, our research shows they respond really well to messaging around wellness. 
 So we're sending out groups of Novices out to several college campuses with these. 
 ‐ I'm sorry. What are those? 
 ‐ These are wellness packs. 
 Well, think of it as Meyerism‐to‐go. 
 ‐ Are you kidding me with that? 
 ‐ I'm sorry. ‐ Those juices are part of a sacred ritual. 
 I mean, what now? We're pushing them as some sort of diet trend? 
 ‐ It's just a way in, you know? 
 Foot in the door for potentials. 
 ‐ Possibles. 
 Does Eddie know about this? 'Cause I find it very hard to believe that he would sign off on something so... 
 Unconventional. 
 ‐ Look, I... I understand this is different for you. 
 You know, taking orders instead of giving them. 
 But that didn't go very well for you, did it, Sarah? 
 ‐ Hey. ‐ Hi. 
 Sweetie. ‐ Hi, Mom. 
 Sorry, I just need to tell Vera that Dad... Eddie... when you have a minute, there's a situation. ‐ What situation? 
 Okay. 
 Well, I'll let you handle the situation. 
 And I will handle the juice. 
 ‐ Forest is a sweetheart. 
 He shouldn't give you any trouble. 
 ‐ Forest is such a cute name. 
 Totally putting it on my list. 
 ‐ Just out of curiosity, how old are you? ‐ 16. 
 But I have, like, eight younger siblings. 
 Half and step and stuff, so, I'm super experienced with babies. 
 ‐ Okay, well, um, we won't be too long. 
 ‐ Oh, no. Take your time. 
 You guys have wireless in here, right? 
 ‐ Yeah. 
 It's over there. 
 Cal? 
 We should go. 
 Honey? 
 Cal. 
 Cal? 
 Get out of here. 
 Cal, what are you doing in there? 
 I'm sorry if I hurt you. 
 Come out, now, please. 
 Cal? 
 ‐ What happened in Boston? 
 You're gonna have to tell me what's going on. 
 ‐ What? No. Nothing happened. I just... 
 I... um... 
 I didn't... I didn't hear you, you just, uh... 
 You scared me so I just need... 
 I need a minute to get ready. ‐ Okay, well, if you can't do it today... ‐ No! No! 
 I... I can do it. I am doing it. 
 Okay. 
 ‐ We need to get out ahead of this. 
 They may seem like some nice immigrant family caring about their own, but you never know what people are capable of. ‐ Oh, they are hurt. 
 They're just concerned for their child. 
 ‐ We need to make sure the Rodrigo family know who they're dealing with. ‐ You sound like a gangster. 
 ‐ Well, don't let the nice clothes or the good manners fool you. 
 I can play dirty if I want to. ‐ 
 ‐ I was raised by a single mom who fought tooth and nail to give me the best possible education from nothing. 
 I saw that sometimes you have to let people know what you're made of. ‐ Look, you don't need to give me the tough times speech, okay? 
 I appreciate that you had to struggle, but I will deal with this the way I see fit. 
 Look, it is one thing to be accused of being a cult leader. 
 It is another thing to act like one. 
 ‐ You've barely recovered from pulling down security and the slaughtered rabbits. ‐ The community has been restored. 
 Okay? People are feeling safe. 
 Sleeping soundly. 
 ‐ Are you? 
 'Cause to me, it doesn't look like you've slept in days. 
 And I know that you're out at night, pacing the compound like your own private watch dog. 
 Okay, I... I don't fault you for wanting to be the good cop. 
 As long as you let me be the bad cop because that's what I'm here for. 
 ‐ I need to do this my way. 
 ‐ I'm so sorry about my parents. 
 They are just clueless and thoughtless. 
 They have no respect. ‐ Look, Monica, I... 
 I didn't come here for an apology. 
 ‐ Oh, my God. You're not kicking me out for this, are you? 
 Please don't. ‐ That's not the way to look at it. ‐ You are. 
 You're kicking me out. 
 ‐ Under my leadership, it is a priority that no one loses connection with their families. 
 That no one feels isolated. 
 That no one feels trapped. 
 ‐ They are the ones who trapped me in their prison of a house. 
 They made me quit anything I ever cared about. 
 They're just all just chasing money and success. 
 My dad's stupid fantasy of the American dream. 
 ‐ Look, you can't be here just to spite your father. 
 You will never find peace in your life until you find peace with him. 
 ‐ But he is not my father anymore. 
 You are. 
 You are the only father I want. 
 You are the only father I need. 
 ‐ Look, get up. 
 Get up! 
 You have to pack your bags and you have to go. 
 All right. Hello. 
 Now, listen, I could quote you lots of facts about exercise and its, uh, life‐lengthening, spine‐strengthening, mood‐stabilizing benefits. 
 But what's the point? 
 But really... 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, uh... 
 Um, I... no... I... 
 "I do not know why yet I live to say," 
 "'This thing's to do.'" 
 "Sith, I have cause and will and strength" 
 "and means to do it." 
 Uh, yeah. That's Shakespeare. 
 Um, that's Hamlet, actually. 
 He's... yeah, he's talking about why he can't get off his ass and murder his traitorous uncle, not about blasting his core, but, uh... 
 I think the quote applies. 
 Um... 
 I don't want you to think about what Cross Blast can do for your body. 
 I want you to think about what it can symbolize. 
 Okay? 
 If you can get here consistently, if you can set a goal and stick to it... yeah, that is the point. 
 The point is to say, I did this thing. 
 All right? I lifted that massive weight. 
 I... I held that excruciating plank longer than I thought I could bear it. 
 So now, what else can I do? 
 Right? Maybe I can... I can ask for that raise. 
 Or... or tell that asshole on the bus to close his legs so I can have a seat. 
 Or maybe I can finally tell that beautiful girl how I really feel about her. 
 This gym isn't the destination. 
 It is a stop on the road to your real challenges. 
 Your real goals. 
 Thank you. Please, please, please, please. 
 Monica chose The Light. 
 You can't just throw her out on the street because Vera thinks she's a liability, or whatever. ‐ This is my decision and my decision alone. ‐ Well, Monica is devastated. 
 She is in her room, sobbing, saying how she can't believe she has to leave. 
 ‐ Look, it is a complicated situation. 
 Unfortunately, it is best for us not to put ourselves in the middle of it. 
 ‐ Do you have any idea how much the Novices believe in you? 
 ‐ You made magic happen. 
 A miracle before their eyes and now because of one angry father you're just gonna back down. 
 ‐ Look, it is not that simple. 
 You cannot imagine the pressure that I am under, being in charge of all of these young people. 
 ‐ I am one of them! 
 I am their youth leader. 
 I understand how they feel. 
 You can't just kick people out 'cause they... 
 ‐ How about how I felt when you shunned me? 
 Hm? 
 I'm not doing that to another family. 
 Never. 
 ‐ That's not your choice to make for other people. 
 You made a commitment to be our father. 
 That means you listen to what we need. 
 ‐ Okay. ‐ God, you are so busy trying not to be a cult leader, you're not being a leader at all. ‐ Hey! Knock it off. 
 Okay? You don't get a free pass around here because you're my kid. 
 Show some f*cking respect. 
 Hawk, I'm not done with you. 
 Hawk! 
 ‐ Blink twice if they're holding you against your will. 
 ‐ I'm sorry? ‐ I was just checking. 
 You never know with these cults. 
 ‐ We're not a cult. 
 We're a religious movement. 
 ‐ Oh, I see. 
 Limited time offer on classes, recruitment of young adults and adolescents, throw in a charismatic father‐figure. 
 I'd say we've got the cult trifectas. 
 ‐ What makes you such an expert? 
 ‐ My doctorate in new American religions, for one thing. 
 Look, I haven't actually studied this, uh... 
 ‐ Meyerist Movement. ‐ Right, uh, specifically. 
 But I'm well aware of how these types of fringe faiths work. 
 You don't have to give me the whole spiel. 
 ‐ Oh, well, don't let the actual facts get in the way of a good snap judgment. 
 ‐ It's not a snap... it... 
 I've spent years studying... 
 ‐ Other faiths. You know nothing about ours. 
 ‐ So what's with the juice? 
 'Cause I mean, you gotta admit, this is pretty culty. 
 ‐ It's part of our sacred tradition. 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ And it's, you know, delicious. 
 And mostly cyanide free. ‐ 
 I have to admit that most of the devout people I meet don't really have a... ‐ What? A sense of humor? 
 ‐ I wasn't gonna put it that way, but yeah. 
 Here. In case you wanna talk some more. 
 ‐ Yeah, I don't. ‐ No, about your religion. 
 My life's work is studying new American faiths. 
 I could really use a fresh perspective. 
 Here, in case you... 
 ‐ 
 ‐ Is that Monica? 
 ‐ I'm so happy you're back. 
 ‐ Hey, Dad. ‐ Hey, there's my big girl. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 I am sorry to keep you waiting. 
 I'm so pumped to meet your teachers. 
 They're gonna say such amazing things. 
 ‐ Yeah, if you talk to my English teacher. 
 Math, kind of a different story. 
 ‐ We should get going. You're, uh... 
 ‐ I know, I'm sorry. 
 ‐ We said 5:00. ‐ Look, work is just a little crazy at the moment. 
 ‐ Dad's here now. That's what matters. 
 ‐ Yeah. ‐ You guys are gonna love my social studies classroom. 
 We have this awesome smart board. 
 ‐ Oh. All right. Put on your seatbelt. 
 All right, come on, guys. 
 ‐ Mr. Lane, can we speak to you for a minute? 
 ‐ Actually, we're running a little behind, so... 
 ‐ Yeah, we need to speak to you now. 
 We're really sorry, but we have the other families to think about. 
 We think that it would be best if your whole family would stay away at this time. 
 ‐ 
 ‐ It's okay. 
 ‐ She gonna fall asleep okay? ‐ Mm, yeah, she was sad to miss it. 
 You know, they had this music presentation prepared. 
 I mean, she'd practiced all week. 
 ‐ It's just so infuriating. 
 Makes me sick. ‐ I know, but she gets that it's the outside world targeting us. 
 She's been there before, you know? 
 She's an amazing kid. ‐ No, it's one thing to target us. 
 But to go after our daughter? 
 ‐ Hey, isn't that what they think we did? 
 I mean, their daughter dropped out of NYU business school. 
 They probably saved every penny to get her there. 
 And then she joins... 
 God knows what we look like to them. 
 They probably think they're never gonna see her again. ‐ I asked her to leave. 
 And then I said she could stay. 
 I mean, this would not have happened... 
 ‐ No, it would've happened eventually. 
 I mean, Novices don't wanna be half in. 
 They want to be all in. 
 Remember? That's how we were. 
 Devoted to the light with every fiber of our beings. 
 And we just have to hope it doesn't get uglier with her parents and their campaign against you. 
 ‐ Hey, I will talk to Vera about this. 
 What? 
 ‐ Nothing. 
 ‐ Say it. 
 Sarah, what? 
 ‐ You know, it just... it feels like you're putting an awful lot of faith in Vera to help you. 
 I mean, since when does an IS know more than we do? 
 ‐ Well, we don't use the term IS anymore. 
 It's Future Possible. 
 And things are changing and Vera is a part of that. 
 Look, she understands the mindset of the outside world. 
 Okay, and she uses that to help us communicate. 
 To grow. ‐ She's marketing our sacred cleanse, Eddie. 
 I'm... I am sorry, but you know what needs marketing? 
 Snake oil. 
 The truth shouldn't need spin. 
 And this doesn't feel just like change. 
 It feels like it's the beginning of the end. 
 
 
 
 ‐ Look, if you are threatened by Vera, you really shouldn't be. 
 ‐ Is that what you think this is? 
 Is that I'm jealous? ‐ She may not be a believer in the faith, but she is a believer in me. 
 ‐ I want you to succeed. 
 I really, really do. ‐ And I will. 
 Look, Vera doesn't make decisions. 
 I do because I was chosen to. 
 ‐ Yes, you were. 
 Good night. 
 I will have Summer call you in the morning. 
 ‐ I see you got the window fixed. 
 ‐ I guess I'm ready for some change too. 
 Bye.

 Mm. 
 ‐ Cheers. ‐ My agent's got me opening up big and tall men's clothing stores. 
 It's God damn humiliating. 
 I need to get into that gym thing, bro. 
 It's just way classier. ‐ It's just the beginning. 
 We're opening all these branches. 
 Miami, Palm Beach. 
 And I get a percent just for letting them use my name. 
 ‐You broke out the rings? 
 ‐ Thanks to Cal, here, I lost enough weight in my fingers I can finally get the damn things on again. 
 ‐ Courtesy of some fans of yours. 
 ‐ Oh. 
 Oh, mm.

 It's clearly intended for me. ‐ Thank you.

 It's the sugar that kills you. 
 ‐ Yeah, yeah. I'm not a trainer. 
 I'm a wellness consultant. 
 ‐ What the f*ck is that? 
 ‐ ‐ I think he puts crystals up his ass.

 ‐ Not too long. ‐ I know. I'll be right back.

 ‐ What is that about? ‐ Yo, what's up with your boy? 
 ‐ New man. 
 ‐ Hello? 
 ‐ I'm... I'm sorry to... 
 I needed to talk to you. 
 I don't want to bother you. 
 It's just that I don't have anyone else who I can... who I can really tell the truth to. 
 About how I'm feeling, about how f*cked up everything is here under Eddie's watch. 
 ‐ Eddie's the savior. 
 He's the man with the magic touch. 
 ‐ He's selling our juices as fasts, like, as if they're diet cleanses, you know? 
 And people are loving it. 
 But is this what it's all for? 
 Everything that we have sacrificed for some shallow, easy, self‐help crap. 
 He... 
 We're going in the wrong direction. 
 And I'm afraid... if we don't stop, we're gonna lose it all. 
 Yeah, the meaningful life and our connection to the eternal and I feel it all slipping away. 
 When you bound me and you took away my breath, I felt it. 
 What Steve meant when he talked about contact with the Infinite Spirit. 
 And I want to feel that again. 
 Make me feel that again. 
 You're the only one who can. 
 ‐ No, no. I... I... 
 I can never do that again, Sarah.

 ‐ It would be a little tacky of me to say I told you so. 
 ‐ Ah, Jesus. 
 They're putting up billboards now. 
 How many? ‐ Two downtown at the center and one by the subway station. 
 These are not cheap ad buys. 
 This family means business. 
 I have contacts at City Hall that will take these billboards down right away, but I don't think the family's gonna stop here. 
 ‐ I mean, they are not rich people. 
 ‐ Exactly. 
 Which makes you wonder what else they'll do... how far they'll go to hurt the Movement, even your family. 
 And they know where Summer goes to school.

 Hawk, God, you scared me. 
 ‐ Sorry. ‐ What are you doing here? 
 ‐ I needed to talk to you. 
 ‐ What's going on? 
 Were you drinking? 
 ‐ I didn't drive, all right? I took the bus, I walked. 
 I needed to see you. 
 This... this whole situation with Monica and her family and all the awful things that they said about you and us and... ‐ Hawk, hey. 
 It comes with the territory. It's okay 
 ‐ I know, but I can't help but think that it was my fault. 
 I mean, I'm the one who told you... 
 ‐ I don't want you to worry about that. 
 Okay? It's not your job. 
 We're handling it. ‐ All right. 
 But... how... are we handling it? 
 I mean... 
 What are you going to do to her family? 
 ‐ Vera is having a lawyer write a letter. 
 That's all. Okay? We don't bully or hurt anyone. 
 ‐ Oh, good, yeah. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I just needed to hear it. 
 You're... you're a good dad. 
 To all of us. 
 You are. I mean... 
 ‐ You're pretty drunk, huh? 
 ‐ The... the Christians. ‐ Mm, the Christians, yeah. 
 ‐ They had... they had a party. 
 It's called fellowship, uh... 
 It's pretty much just beer. 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. 
 ‐ I, um... 
 I'm sorry. I should've known better. 
 I'm supposed to be responsible now, ‐ Stop. Hey. 
 You're doing great work at the center. 
 But you're still a kid. 
 It's fine. 
 All right. I was just about to do my nightly prayer. 
 ‐ Right. 
 ‐ No, no. 
 You wanna join me? 
 Source of light, we need your strength, righteous and good. 
 Shine through us. 
 Make us a vessel so that we may bring hope, strength and comfort to all of those in your embrace. 
 If darkness falls... 
 ‐ Make me a light. 
 ‐ When darkness falls. 
 ‐ Make me a light. 
 ‐ Coming! 
 ‐ Are you Bonoy Garica? 
 ‐ Who the hell are you? 
 ‐ Okay, I'll ask you again. 
 Are you Bonoy Garica? 
 ‐ No. 
 ‐ Good. 
 Because Bonoy Garcia has an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court on a suspended license charge. 
 Oh, and he also doesn't have a green card. 
 So if you happen to know him you might wanna give him a message. 
 ‐ He is my brother. 
 ‐ Ah, that's right. I see the resemblance. 
 I have friends who work at ICE and these days, deporting undocumented people with criminal records is... it's a big priority. 
 ‐ What do you want? 
 ‐ End your campaign against the Meyerist Movement. 
 Or I'll get very loud. 
 Your daughter wants her freedom. 
 And as a natural‐born American citizen, she's entitled to it. 
 As painful as it is, we have to let our children go. 
 ‐ 
 ‐ Is something like Southern Baptism a fundamentalist kind of cult and... hey. 
 ‐ I didn't know you were... ‐ Hey, hello there. 
 ‐ In class here. I should just come back. 
 ‐ No, no, no. Please, don't be shy. 
 Come in, come in. This is... my upper‐level seminar meeting in the office. ‐ I didn't mean to barge in. 
 ‐ Not at all. No, introduce yourself, please. 
 ‐ Hi. 
 Uh, I'm Sarah Lane. 
 I'm with the Meyerist Movement. 
 Your teacher... professor asked me to come in here and discuss my beliefs. 
 But I didn't expect a crowd, so... 
 ‐ Don't... it's not a problem. Please, stay. 
 Can you give her... thank you. 
 Please, have a seat. The class is called The American Religion: cults and fringe faiths since the turn of the century. 
 So we've had the opportunity to speak to some former Haredim, some former Seventh‐Day Adventists, former Scientologists. ‐ Mm‐hmm, well, I'm a Meyerist. 
 An active one... devout, even. 
 ‐ Well, okay. 
 That's a new one. 
 ‐ You're saying everyone that you've talked to has left their faith? ‐ Yep, pretty much. 
 Most people do. 
 Once they put it to some scrutiny. 
 ‐ Okay, then. 
 Well, I'm here. 
 Ask me anything. 
 Rake me over the coals. 
 ‐ Anybody? 
 ‐ Are you an apocalyptic faith? 
 Do you believe the end of the world is coming? 
 ‐ Well, it is. 
 We all know that, right? 
 I mean, we acknowledge that the actions of man... global warming, the pollution of air and water... it's all bringing on environmental destruction. 
 I mean, every sane person knows that, right? 
 ‐ But you believe that your faith will save you. 
 Isn't that right? ‐ Well, yes. 
 ‐ So where do you go? When the rest of us perish in pollution, flooding, fire. 
 Is it an ark? A cloud? 
 ‐ A Garden. ‐ Oh, a garden. 
 That make sense. ‐ Simon, come on. 
 All right, I want everybody to remember how lucky we are to have such a courageous individual here with us today. 
 Please respect that in your questions. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Where have you been? 
 Harold kept calling last night. 
 And then he, um... he came back drunk and was banging on the door. 
 I had to tell him that you weren't feeling well. 
 He was, uh... 
 I've never seen him like that before. 
 Are you gonna say something, Cal? 
 ‐ Um... 
 Mm... 
 I... I think something bad happened to me. 
 ‐ What? When? 
 Last night? ‐ No, no. 
 A long time ago, when I was a child. 
 ‐ Hey. 
 ‐ All right, I'm sorry. 
 Sorry I was out. 
 Did Forest go down okay? 
 Truth is only possible when silence is broken. 
 We're reading from chapter 28, paragraph 13. 
 ‐ It brought me to tears... thinking of the abuse that I had as a child and the silence that I kept. 
 ‐ Yes. 
 Yes, when we speak out as women, as oppressed... when we speak out, against injustice and poison and greed, we narrow the channel between the darkness and the light. 
 ‐ And they want us in the dark. 
 I mean, they collect more and more information on us. 
 They feed on our ignorance. 
 ‐ But the son is here and he is spreading the word. 
 And he is summoning the most powerful light... the cleansing fire of destruction that will take away the damage and the pain so we, the truly chosen... we will inherit The Garden whose name is Truth. 
 ‐ Hello? 
 Is anybody out here? 
 Hey, look, if anyone's here, it's time to come out. 
 All right? 
 ‐ Ahh! 
 ‐ Uh!
