 Previously on "The Path"... 
 Do you recognize that... that place? 
 Is it on our campus? 
 What is this about, Sarah? 
 He had inappropriate... urges. 
 What if all of this was built on the cravings of a very sick man? 
 I took the medicine last night. 
 I was on one path and you were on a different one. 
 Best and final. 
 You're accusing Stephen Meyer of molesting you? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Cal blackmailed me. 
 I help Eddie accept him into the fold, and he doesn't say a word. 
 What do you want? 
 I want what I had. 
 I want to be out in front, speaking for The Movement. 
 ♪ 
 We all know Eddie Lane's story. 
 Okay. We're going on the road, visiting veteran centers in Minneapolis and San Diego, and, uh, also consecrating a new one, in Memphis, and the apex, Philadelphia. 
 What do you need me to do? You will be the opening act, warming up the crowds for Eddie. 
 Oh, we all know Eddie Lane's story. 
 The struggles, the loss, doubts. 
 Most of us can relate. 
 Drew us to him from the very beginning. 
 You said you wanted to speak for The Movement, right? 
 We both know this isn't what I had in mind. 
 That's what drew us to him from the very beginning. 
 Eddie Lane's come a long way. 
 And now, by virtue of The Light's... grace, we get to be a part of his every triumph. 
 I see we're also hawking juice and, uh, glorified dirt now. 
 We are helping nourish hearts and minds from the inside out. 
 I think you should try them. 
 You've given up all of your other clients for this. 
 The Movement is the only client I need. 
 The most devout are usually those with the most Damage. 
 ♪ What? 
 Sometimes you seem, uh... familiar. 
 ♪ 
 "Eddie Lane's come a long way." 
 This is for you. 
 ♪ You can't get enough Eddie Lane's come a long way. 
 And now, by virtue of The Light's grace... we all get to be a part of his... every triumph. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Eddie Lane. 
 ♪ Can't get enough God, it kills me that I'm going to miss it. 
 You know how much it breaks my heart that I'm not going to see you in that play, right? 
 I know. 
 But Mom is going to tape it and I'm going to watch it a hundred times. 
 Okay? 
 Hey, is your mom around? 
 Yeah, hold on. 
 Mom, Daddy wants to talk to you. 
 You know I love you the most. 
 I know, I know. Fiercely and forever. 
 Um, now's not really a good time. 
 That's all right. 
 Well, tell me more about the play's rehearsals. 
 Is anyone messing up on their lines? 
 Yes. Rose is. 
 Are you? - No. 
 No? 
 All right, okay. I know, little guy. 
 Almost there. 
 Almost where? 
 Could you grab his Sophie? 
 This is never gonna end. 
 I don't understand why you weren't just honest with me the first time. 
 You looked so cute in that little apron. 
 You were so excited about cooking me dinner, I couldn't just spit it out, right then and there. 
 Could you please keep it a bit quiet? 
 Please? Thank you. - Sorry. 
 Aah! - Ah, right, good. 
 Are you okay? 
 It's not burning him. 
 He's climbing. He's climbing. 
 Good job! Good job. 
 I'm in love. That's beautiful. 
 Good getting burned. 
 So, let's get the kinks out of the anointment next. 
 What do you say? 
 Places! 
 I want my Eddie on the top of the stairs. 
 Beautiful. Wind! 
 Rain! 
 Lightning! 
 Aah! 
 Eddie, it's you. 
 I don't understand. 
 What's happening to me? 
 The Light chose you, Eddie. 
 You are the chosen son. 
 You must keep The Light inside of everyone alive. 
 Wait, don't go! 
 Lead them to The Garden when the time comes. 
 I'll be waiting. 
 Okay, and the light gets brighter and brighter here, enveloping Steve, our Eddie walks downstairs, and... - What's going on? 
 What's happening? 
 Where's Steve? - It's Eddie. 
 Summer? 
 Summer, we have to go. 
 Why? What's going on? 
 Did something happen? 
 I'm sorry, but she's... she's not doing the play. 
 She's not doing... - What? 
 We have to go. 
 Now. 
 Sarah... 
 I don't understand - Sorry, she's not doing this. 
 Let's go. 
 I'm rehearsing h... Put your hands down. 
 No Christ, no Light! 
 No Christ, no Light! You're gonna burn in Hell! 
 No Christ, no Light! 
 Get out of Memphis! 
 And take your goddamn religion with you! 
 Now, we all know Eddie Lane's story. 
 Right? The struggles, the loss, the doubts... 
 Most of us can relate. 
 It's what drew us to him from the very beginning. 
 That Light-infused face mask is really good. 
 You should get it. 
 And now, by virtue of The Light's grace, we get to be a part of his every triumph. 
 No Christ, no Light! We get to be part of... 
 Of each other's triumph. 
 You know, because... when this... when this community is united, nothing can stand in our way. Right? 
 As... as pioneers of a righteous cause... 
 Because we are the righteous. 
 We have The Light. 
 We are The Light. 
 Let me hear it. We are Light! 
 We are The Light! 
 This isn't part of the script. 
 We are Light! 
 They love it. 
 And that strength... 
 That strength is a reflection of who we follow, and who we follow is Eddie Lane! 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Um, I want to, first off, thank all of you for coming out today, and every other day, when no one's taking attendance. 
 Your efforts are inspiring. They really, really are. 
 Um, I'm supposed to shepherd the ones who are lost. 
 Restore their faith. 
 Ensure their place in The Garden. 
 That all sounds a little crazy, right? I mean, hey, it did to me. 
 But I am here to tell you... 
 That it is true. 
 The Light... The Light chose me. 
 To lead you. 
 And doing so is the greatest joy of my life. 
 ♪ 
 I can't sit here any longer and pretend that everything's all right. Everything's not all right. 
 Mom, I explained. Please. 
 You know, I just don't think it's right for... 
 For kids to enact something that they don't understand. 
 But I do understand, Mom. 
 Look, the play, it's not accurate. 
 You've rewritten everything that happened. 
 I've done no such thing! 
 Felicia getting burned first, Eddie's doubts, his time away from here... 
 Okay, I may have taken some creative liberties, but I hardly think... 
 No, no. People are more complicated than you're portraying them, Mom. 
 I did the play. 
 Seven times. It's the best part about summer. Bonding with these kids... 
 They're a part of your community, your family... 
 She has to complete the play to be able to take her vows. 
 What? 
 Is that true? - Yes. 
 Every child has to complete the story in order to take their vows at 16. 
 Great. She can do it next year. 
 Wait. Okay. 
 I'm just... I'm trying to understand. 
 Are you really concerned that she isn't ready to handle the material? 
 Because I've been working with her very closely. 
 She isn't simply saying the words. 
 She knows their importance. She's living them. 
 This is just exactly... And no offense, Hawk, but she's the best Steve we ever had. 
 Mom, please, can you please just trust my instincts as a parent? 
 But it's not fair. 
 Honey, I know it's not fair, honey. 
 Sometimes life isn't fair, and I'm... 
 Listen, Summer, I'm not trying to be... 
 I'm not trying to hurt her. I don't get it. 
 At all. 
 I'm worried, sweetie. Help me understand. 
 Mom, there is nothing to be worried about. 
 I know you experienced something very traumatic some months ago. 
 Maybe the violence in the play is servicing your Damage, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
 No, it has nothing to do with that. 
 Then what is it, Mom? What's going on? 
 Please, what the hell is... 
 I don't want her idolizing Steve! 
 I don't want her idolizing anyone. 
 We're done here. 
 ♪ 
 Hey, Cal, can I borrow you a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 Um, listen... I know that this may be a humbling experience for you... 
 No, no, it's, uh... glad to be of help. 
 Any way you see fit. 
 That's good, and I... 
 I appreciate that, but this tour is just a little different than what you are used to, so there's... 
 No, there's no need for... 
 For grandstanding. 
 I'm not following. 
 "The righteous cause?" 
 The call-and-response? 
 Oh. This isn't a fascist rally. 
 I know, I just thought that people needed a little, uh, buoying after braving protesters and... 
 Yeah, no, I-I see that, but, um... that's just not how we do things now, so ease up, you know. 
 Stay on book. 
 Sure thing. - All right. 
 Shall we get our room? 
 Oh, what, we get our own? We don't have to sleep at Eddie's feet? 
 You know, you killed it in there. 
 He should be thanking you. 
 I'm going to take a walk. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. Got your room key. 
 Mm. The old traditional kind. 
 36, it's upstairs. 
 Great. Thank you. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Listen, I know this tour wasn't the best timing for you, family-wise, you know, with your daughter's play. 
 Yeah, well, what can you do? 
 You know? 
 Yeah, Cal... Cal was great. 
 He was... he was good. 
 Yeah, Cal. You know. 
 It's not going to happen again. He was just... a little over the top. 
 I had a talk with him. It's gonna be fine. 
 Okay. You know, best to get the kinks out of the way before Philadelphia. 
 We want the message to be yours. 
 Mm. Hey, um... thank you, for... keeping me sane through all of this, or at least trying to. 
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
 Really appreciate it. 
 Ah. It's your mom. 
 Don't want to ignore mom. 
 Hey, thank you. 
 This is Vera Stephens. 
 Leave a message, and I'll return your call. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You're still seeing spots, shadows. 
 It's time. We tried it your way, but now... 
 I can't even be in a doctor's office. 
 There's no way I'm having surgery. 
 If we don't remove the eye, the melanoma will spread, and it will kill you. 
 Have you talked to Vera? 
 She'll talk some sense into you. 
 She's not here. 
 She's on the road with the son, spreading the word. 
 You haven't told her. 
 We can't afford distractions. 
 Please know that we are beholden to you and to her for all you do. 
 You won't go through this alone. 
 We will be there. 
 I will be there. 
 As much as you'll let me. 
 We need you with us on the other side of this. 
 We can't start over without you.

 Yeah. You got to hit 'em just right. 
 Well, well, well. Um, thank you. 
 Very much. 
 I appreciate it, my friend. 
 So, I saw you speak back in Memphis. 
 What you said about The Light. 
 It really got to me. 
 That's good to hear. 
 I wanted to tell you so, but... y'all cut out before I had the chance. 
 Eddie Lane. 
 Daniel Givens. 
 Nice to meet you, Daniel. 
 So, uh, what brought you to the new center? 
 Uh, it's my kid, actually. 
 She's not doing so great. 
 I want to make it all better for her all the time, but... 
 I can't seem to be able to do anything right. 
 I got two myself. 
 I know the territory. 
 Her mom left us. 
 She woke up one morning, said she couldn't stay, had to go, had to live her life. 
 Turned around and never looked back. 
 Poor kid just couldn't get over it. 
 That's terrible. 
 I'm really sorry to hear about... 
 Oh, God, you know, I hate... I hate to do this to you, Daniel, right now, but I got to take this. 
 You know, I can get someone to talk to you. 
 If you'd just talk to my little girl, I think it'd do a lot of good. I would like to do that, but in the meantime, Sharon would love to help you. Okay? 
 Hopefully, you and I will run into each other again. 
 All right? 
 Hi. Sharon Walker. 
 I'd love to sit down with you. 
 I'll wait. 
 Well, he might be a while. 
 Come on. 
 We're all family here. 
 I'll bet you are. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 She's... she's not engaging with us at all. 
 Just put your mom on the phone. 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 Something else is going on. 
 Completely unreasonable. 
 Hawk, just hand her the phone, please. 
 Oh, Eddie asked me to help. 
 Okay, well, what can we do for you? 
 No, I don't... no, no, no, no. 
 I'm... I'm fine. - What...? 
 Dad wants to talk to you. 
 Maybe we can... we can help you. 
 No... no, if... No, I'm fine. 
 I see you're... you're uncomfortable. 
 Just let us talk to you... No, it's all right. 
 Sir, all we want to do is... 
 I don't want your help! 
 Okay, okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Hey, I guess Hawk's gotten you up to speed. 
 Not in any way that explains why you would pull Summer from The Awakening. 
 You know, the play is supposed to be our story, our truth, but it's never really been that, has it? 
 It's taken me a while to figure that out. 
 The whole thing's a farce, and I don't want our daughter to... Wait, wait, wait. 
 Is that what you believe? 
 That the play is a joke, that all of this is... what? No, of course not. 
 It's not... it's not a joke. 
 You know what? It doesn't... it doesn't matter. 
 Of course it matters what you think, Sarah. 
 It matters to me. What is it? 
 You know, if you want to have a say in our daughter's extracurricular activities, then you should come home. 
 Oh, my... I would love nothing more, and you know that. But this isn't an extracurricular activity, Sarah. 
 You know what? I'm not going to go another round tonight. 
 If you want a say, come home. 
 Look, I don't know what the hell is going on with you, and obviously, you're not going to tell me, but how dare you pull Summer into it? 
 Put her back in the f*cking play. 
 No. 
 Sarah... ♪ 
 Yeah? Okay, we'll take those. 
 Right? 
 Oh, that's not in your future. 
 Take it off. 
 How about this? 
 Oh, well, you'll grow into it. 
 You know, we deserve some treats, putting up with all that crazy, right? 
 Right? 
 Okay, we'll take these... and that. 
 There you go. 
 Okay. 
 Dad... Hello, baby girl.

 Hey. 
 Hey. We've been looking for you. 
 Um, yeah, I just... want some, um, alone time.

 Uh-oh. 
 I've lost Eddie. 
 Oh. Sorry. 
 It's just, uh, family stuff. 
 Do you want to talk about it? 
 No, not really. 
 I just... God, I'm so frustrated. 
 My wife... ex... 
 Sarah is going through something right now, and I just don't know what to do, and it's affecting our kids, and... uh...

 How? 
 What, just cancel the tour, cancel Philadelphia? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 You don't have to... 
 Well, not... not entirely. 
 Oh. We'll have Cal do it. 
 Oh, he would love that. 
 Get behind the wheel. 
 Eddie, Eddie, I'll make sure he stays on message. 
 Look, people will be disappointed, but Cal will give a good speech, and they'll have a good time, and he'll never be you. 
 Look, if I bail, there's gonna be something else. 
 There's always something else. 
 Someone else, you know, someone will get let down. 
 Yeah. I guess you have to choose who you want to let down, then. 
 Okay. 
 Whatever you decide, we'll... we'll make do with it. 
 Okay. Just let me know. 
 But why didn't you tell me when you first saw him? I could've easily... 
 Because I wasn't sure if he was real, and I kept hoping that he wasn't and that I was just losing it because I've been so tired. 
 But why are you meeting with him? 
 Like, what are you hoping to gain from this? 
 He won't stop following me until I hear him out. 
 You know, if you don't want to come, you don't have to. 
 No, I just... I don't want to see you get hurt. 
 I won't. 
 This is a chance for my dad to see me, really see me. 
 Sober, with Forest, doing so well. 
 And... what if it doesn't go the way you plan? 
 Well, um... I guess I'm used to it. 
 Nothing goes as planned with you, Cal. 
 It's gonna take time. Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, there is no plan, is there? 
 You could try having a little faith. 
 I believe in you, baby. 
 I mean, I loved watching Eddie Embrace our son, and I-I love watching you fluff him out there every night. 
 I've always been here for you. 
 I'm just... now, I'm not sure if you're trying to convince me that things will be different, or yourself. 
 ♪ Mom must be so pissed. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 You know, when I was a kid, the play meant everything to me. 
 I knew every single word of it, and now Summer does, and she's being taught to revere a man that... 
 Might have made the whole thing up? 
 Yeah. 
 Sarah? Are you having doubts? 
 You know, maybe you were the lucky one. 
 Leaving when you did? - No. 
 I gave up a lot when I left. 
 I'm still paying for it. I-I am never going to have a real relationship with my mom, and my children barely even know what their grandmother looks like.
