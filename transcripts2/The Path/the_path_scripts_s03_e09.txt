 Previously on "The Path"... 
 I'm here to talk to you about my son Caleb and your son Hawk. 
 It's been brought to my attention that their friendship is inappropriate. 
 If I ever softened the truth, it was only to protect you. 
 And the scar on my back? 
 The one you burned into me. 
 Was that to protect me, too? 
 I want to become a Meyerist. 
 I just saw JP. He wants me to help him. 
 The answer is to find more JPs. Make them my followers. 
 I think that this is the cause of a celebration. 
 Is Lilith alive? She's alive. 
 But if you contact her, she might tell you things, Sarah, that make it impossible for you to go back. 
 Do you know where she is? 
 She's a veterinarian on Riverside and 72nd Street. 
 You found me. 
 ♪ 
 The first vision came to me when I was seven. 
 I was in my room trying to sleep. 
 My parents were fighting very badly again, so... 
 I lay there sad and afraid, when suddenly I... 
 I saw light in my window, and it wasn't the moon because there wasn't a moon that night. 
 And I stood up to see what it was, and as I pulled myself toward it, the light just burst through and wrapped itself around me like a warm blanket. 
 How did you know what it was? 
 I didn't. Not at first, but I... 
 I felt comforted, understood, like I was no longer alone. 
 The Light continued to visit me regularly over the next 15 years until the message was revealed. 
 How was the message revealed? Did The Light speak to you? 
 There was no voice or words. 
 But sometimes it showed me things. 
 And every time I felt its presence, I had the need directly after to write. 
 There was a message I was compelled to put down. 
 Was the message much different than Meyerism? 
 Different to what Steve... 
 I was 13 when my parents brought me to Steve. 
 I saw the journals... at least the ones that you and Steve worked on together. 
 He kept them? 
 My parents didn't understand my writings and obsessions, writing visions of the end of the world, so they sought out a psychiatrist for me. 
 I thought he worked for the military? 
 Yes, but he took on private patients that interested him. 
 Did he... steal your visions? 
 He believed in me. 
 He helped me make sense of the visions, The Ladders, these rungs. 
 It's like we worked on it together. 
 What is it? 
 I don't believe in you. 
 I was hoping that I was gonna come here and you were gonna answer all the questions about the religion I have been... devoted to my whole life. 
 And you were gonna help me believe again. 
 ♪ I wish I could be the answer for you, but I can only tell you about my experiences. 
 ♪ Take this. 
 It's what The Light revealed to me... 
 The Truth. 
 ♪ 
 So, after a lot of thought and careful consideration, Sarah and I've decided that, uh... she will no longer be a part of The Movement. 
 Mom wants to leave The Movement? 
 Listen, kid, she has been struggling with her faith for a while. 
 And we realized that she just doesn't want to be here. 
 Why didn't she say anything to me? 
 Look, I am sure that she will reach out to you today. 
 We made the decision late last night. 
 Look, as you know, Sarah is deeply loved here. 
 I think we can help the membership see that her departure is a personal choice. 
 Nothing to do with you or your leadership. 
 I appreciate that. 
 I don't want there to be gossip where there doesn't need to be. 
 Neither does your mother. 
 Hey, Cal, if you have a second, I'd like to... 
 Yeah. 
 See you, kid. 
 You know, uh, it seems, with every new member, we have ten new problems. 
 How can I help? 
 Well, city inspector came through, said our nursery is over capacity, said that we need to refile as a school-age child care educational center, but there's a 14-month application backlog. 
 Right. I'm guessing we won't be allowed to operate in the meantime. 
 Only... the inspector literally said maybe there's a way to move our application to the top of the pile. 
 He wants to... - Yeah, then... there's this idiot. 
 Rufus Mott? - Yeah. 
 Rufus is suing us for $2 million. 
 He voluntarily ended his 1R training. 
 Right. 
 Then the next day he slipped and fell on some wet stairs. 
 What does Carla say? 
 Thinks that we should settle out of court. 
 Seems like a dangerous precedent, especially the way we're growing. 
 Exactly. I don't know. 
 I mean... this is all bullshit. 
 He doesn't deserve anything. 
 It's just... Vera always dealt with this. 
 How? 
 Where is she? 
 State your name, please. 
 Vera Stephens. 
 All right, Vera. 
 The first question we always ask, and I want you to think carefully before you answer... 
 Why are you here? 
 To be free, to be in control of my life, for my life to be my own. 
 Do you currently feel like you're not in control of your own life? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Is there anything else? 
 I want to be good. 
 Once you start this work, you won't question your goodness. 
 Hey, Rita. Oh, Cal, Eddie, hi. 
 We were just having a really great intake session. 
 Oh, great. Well, uh, we'll let you get back to it. 
 We just need to speak with Vera for a minute. 
 Oh, of course. 
 Thank you. - Thank you. 
 Look, I, um... 
 I hate to do this to you, but... 
 We need help to pick up where you left off. 
 You got a knack with these sort of situations. 
 Um... 
 I don't want to be that person anymore. 
 No, no, no, now. We're not looking for you to do anything. 
 Just, uh... just help us mimic your unique brand of personal efficiency. 
 High-powered lawyers, bribes, and blackmail. 
 Am I just wasting my time here? I mean... 
 Can't someone like me become a great Meyerist? 
 Yes. 
 Of course. 
 Okay, we've all done things. 
 Um, I want to take the ODE, you know, the one that... that the boy took... Logan. 
 The one with the swastika. Yeah, yeah. 
 No, but why? - The ODE is for... 
 "Especially damaged Possibles." 
 I know. I remember. 
 It scores your potential for The Light. 
 Yeah, I mean, it's supposed to. 
 But that test is outdated... I want to take it. 
 You don't know the things I've done and the people I come from. 
 Hey, stop. 
 Look, I know you. 
 Okay? You are full of Light. 
 I don't need the ODE to tell me that. 
 Well, I do. 
 ♪ 
 What's going on? 
 I could ask the same of you. 
 Look, I'm sorry about my behavior at Dad's offering night. 
 You left The Movement. 
 So it's out? You're Sarah Lane, okay? 
 Of course it's out. Look, I'm sorry. I've been... 
 What am I supposed to tell my kids about their aunt? 
 Tell them whatever you need to, Russel. 
 Okay, look, if you are suffering... 
 There's something going on. 
 We're all here for you. 
 Thank you. I-I appreciate that. I... 
 Yeah. 
 What's that? 
 What's going on? 
 Russel? 
 There you are. Hey. 
 Mom, what are you doing? 
 We're gonna get through this. 
 Mm. - Are you moving in? 
 I'm just providing support in this time... 
 Temporary support. 
 That's the last of it. Oh, thank you, darling. 
 Mwah. 
 Let me know if you need anything. 
 Uh, Russel... We're all good. 
 We're all good. - Wait. 
 I'll stay in Hawk's room. Mom, this is so unnecessary. 
 Oh, but it is so necessary. 
 It is absolutely, 100% necessary. 
 I know this is difficult. No. 
 I talked to your dad about it, and we're in agreement. 
 You talked to Dad? Every day. 
 And I promised him. 
 I will not let you leave The Movement. 
 ♪ 
 We're usually drinking... a group of us powerful men. 
 There's champagne and cigars, oysters. 
 Girls inevitably join. They want to be with us. 
 Women. - Huh? 
 They're women, Congressman. 
 I know. 
 Jesus, I know, but see, the thing is... 
 Sexual harassment. 
 What isn't these days? 
 Three women are accusing you of groping them in the ladies' room on three separate occasions. 
 That's bullshit, okay? 
 These girls drink so much, they can hardly even walk. 
 I'm helping them get to the toilet. 
 What is the harm in that? 
 There could be lots of harm, but the harm I care about... 
 Jesus. You sound like the lawyers. 
 But the harm I care about, the harm I know you care about, is the harm you're doing to yourself. 
 Plenty of politicians have kept their seats after doing something like this. 
 I don't give a f*ck about you keeping your seat. Reassuring. 
 You pay other people to do that. 
 I care about you. 
 I care about you... harming yourself psychically, emotionally. 
 Look at her. 
 Now, when you see a woman like Mary, what do you need from her? 
 No, look at me, Buck. Me only. 
 What do you need from a woman... when you sexualize her immediately? 
 Uh, I need... 
 What do you need from that woman? 
 Tell me right now. 
 To tell me something. - What? 
 That they notice me. 
 What do you want them to notice about you? 
 That I'm a man. 
 That's what I thought. 
 Please stand up, Buck. 
 Right, stand up, please, now. 
 ♪ What's going on? 
 Unbuckle your pants and pull down your underwear, please. 
 f*ck you, buddy. 
 Look, I'm not one of your little followers. 
 Listen to me. 
 Stand up, unbuckle your pants, pull down your underwear, now, please. 
 What is this? 
 Some kind of joke or something? 
 You some kind of pervert? No... 
 And it's not. 
 But you will lose everything if you piss away this opportunity. 
 I know... you're scared and vulnerable. 
 This is not a joke or a-a humiliation. 
 Go on. 
 ♪ 
 This is insane. 
 ♪ Take a look down. 
 Go ahead. 
 What's down there? 
 Never mind. 
 You know what it is. - I do.

 Say it.

 You can pull your pants up. 
 ♪ So wait, let me get this straight. 
 Caleb's father visits your dad, tells him he doesn't want you two together, and that's the last you hear from him? 
 He texted me saying that he needed to take care of some stuff. 
 I really don't want to talk about this right now. 
 Oh, that's awful. Horrible. 
 I hope he's okay. 
 Caleb could come live with us. 
 He could because we are part of a faith that is so loving and compassionate and accepting. 
 Uh... it wasn't always so accepting. 
 That is debatable. 
 You're open to the possibility. 
 That's new. 
 Look where we are now. That's what matters. 
 I'm sorry you're going through this. 
 It sounds like Caleb has some tough choices to make right now. 
 Is that what you're doing? 
 Making choices? - I guess it is. 
 Um, I don't like... 
 The direction The Movement is heading. 
 But it's temporary. 
 So why not fight it? 
 I mean, nothing changes if you... if you don't push back. 
 Or did Dad really bully you into leaving? 
 It was a mutual decision. 
 Well, I really wish you'd told me were discussing this. 
 It's hard being at the mercy of everyone else's choices when it doesn't always feel like I have one of my own. 
 Oh, sh1t. - Hey. 
 Look, it's not like that. 
 Okay? I just... I just want to talk. 
 Please. 
 You never finished your 1R training. 
 It says in your intake folder that you didn't finish college either... at three different places. 
 Computer school, music school... So what? 
 I mean, you came to us in search of something. 
 What are you looking for, Rufus? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know? Come on, take a guess. 
 Look, I'm not supposed to... Take a guess. 
 Somewhere I belong... I guess. 
 See, I hear that. 
 What made you feel like you didn't belong with us? 
 I-I don't know, man. Are you sure? 
 All the personal questions. 
 I was down with it at first, but then it got, like... too personal... - Huh. Like, invasive. 
 Listen, what if we were able to create a program where you were able to have some more private space? 
 Could we convince you to come back? 
 Drop the lawsuit, give us another try? 
 I knew you were going to try some Jedi mind trick bullshit. 
 No, hey, I'm just trying to help you out, okay? 
 You're trying to get out of paying me. 
 You guys have money. 
 Yeah, money to help people... 
 People in need, people with addiction, homeless families, victims of disasters. 
 Yeah. 
 I really can't do this. 
 You got to go. My manager's gonna flip. 
 Look, I understand... that space is very important to you, that you must had a lot of it growing up as a kid... 
 Only child in that big house of your parents on Bay Street. 
 Till they split. That's none of your business. 
 Then you two were forced to move around... 
 You and your mom... a lot less space. 
 They told me you wouldn't read all that. 
 But your dad was able to stay put in that big house of his on Bay Street... now with his new family... even after your mom tried to sue him over and over again, but your dad didn't care. 
 He would rather spend every dollar he made on a lawyer so he wouldn't have to give your mom the money that she deserved. 
 Look, you can just keep looking, or you can come back... somewhere you belong. 
 It's your decision.
