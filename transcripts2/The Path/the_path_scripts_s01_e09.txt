 Eddie : Previously on "The Path"... 
 I don't even know what's real anymore, and what is... 
 We'll just figure it out, because you're real to me. 
 You know, if there's anything I can do to help... 
 Cal came and got me. 
 You're here. 
 He said this is where I'm supposed to be. 
 They are trying to kill me, and they will kill you. 
 [panting] 
 Come on, Alison. Come back with me. 
 [grunts] 
 Go! 
 I want you to take the walk. 
 Steve's walk? 
 If you don't do the walk, I will tell Sarah everything. 
 I'll tell her you don't believe. 
 Hawk : When did you know about... you always hear the elders talking about the moment when they felt it, The Light. 
 Closest thing to it, when I met your mom. 
 Stop. 
 You know, she can just... 
 What's going on? 
 Lift all my doubts. 
 And he's lying to you.

 Your words... 
 [sighs] 
 And you said to me often when I was growing up... you said it again the day of your... your diagnosis. 
 [church bell rings] 
 "Don't let The Movement die. 
 You're the only one I can trust to keep it alive." 
 I've tried to fulfill your wishes. 
 I'm trying to be your son. 
 [bell rings] 
 I wrote the rungs. 
 I tried to channel you. 
 But if... if you're unhappy with me, please tell me, 'cause there won't be another chance. 
 [church bell ringing] 
 I'm sorry for everything... 
 [sniffles] 
 I have done that is wrong and everything wrong... 
 [sighs] 
 I do next.

 I don't know what you're thinking, but we're not having an affair. 
 Why did he call you 22 times in the last three months? 
 It's not my place to say. 
 Your husband left a journal. 
 What? 
 I took his file, and the journal was in it. 
 Where is it? 
 They found it in the room that he was staying at in Peru. 
 Why wasn't it given to the police?

Steve understood the challenges of bringing together a community of people with deep wounds. That's why we have to forgive. That's the only way to heal. Why don't you take a week in rehab, Betsy? It'll do you good. I'll talk to Richard. [sighs] I know how hard this must be for you. I know you came to us full of heartbreak. But perhaps this is what The Light is giving in return. Steve believes that committing to another human being's wounds, past, present, and future, is a great challenge but also the most rewarding experience one can have in this life. That's why marriage is a cornerstone of The Movement. If you forgive me, I want that... that challenge. With you. I kept thinking when I was walking, we know nothing. Nothing of suffering. You know, we may walk 250 miles with no money and, yeah, our feet hurt and we see poverty and pain, but nothing compared to how people in other countries live. We're in our own backyard. I mean, for us, it'll end. We will finish the walk and end up in our comfy beds. What about you, Hawk? Um... [clears throat] I-I don't know. You don't know? What did you miss? Probably my comfy bed. Uncle Cal kept it warm for you. What? He was sick... body sick, so he slept in Hawk's bed. Really? Yes. What was he sick with? Uh, guys... And he's not your uncle. Eddie.
