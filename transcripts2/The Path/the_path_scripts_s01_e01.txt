I shouldn't have gotten so angry. I'm sorry too. [ominous music] [applause] Hello, everybody. Welcome to our service. It's beautiful to see you all here today. This morning, I'm gonna tell you the story of Plato's Cave. Plato asks you to imagine this cave that people are born into, chained, so they can only see in one direction... At the wall in front of them. Everybody got that? [laughter] On this wall in front of them, they see figures, shapes. And they have names for the things that they see. Their work, their jobs, their towns, their friends, their lovers, their gods. And of course the prisoners believe everything they see is real, true. Why wouldn't they? It's what they see every day. It's all they know. Now, Plato says, "Imagine one of these prisoners is able to get free." He doesn't say how, but this prisoner gets free, and for the first time, he's able to see behind him, and he sees that there's a fire. And between the fire and the prisoners there is a bridge, and across the bridge, figures walk. And suddenly the free man realizes that what he and his fellow prisoners have been seeing all this time are the shadows of the real things that walk over the bridge. All : Oh! [laughter] Shadows of reality. Now, the man understands that everything he thought was real, isn't. So now he wonders, "Well, what else don't I know?" [laughter] And he scrapes and he crawls his way up out of the cave, until finally he pulls himself out panting, breathless. And that's when he sees the sky, the sun, the moon, the... the things that make the seasons. And the free man realizes that there is a real, true world out there that his fellow prisoners, his friends, they don't know. So now he's got to tell them. [laughter] So he comes back ranting and raving. "What you think is real, isn't. You're a prisoner. Your life isn't real. You're just looking at shadows." Then, Plato asks, "What would the prisoners do?" Would they, if they could, stone this man? Kill him rather than have their reality destroyed? What would you do? Would you choose to remain in your shackles? No. Would you choose  to hold on to your pain and your suffering? All : No. Or would you dare to break free? Break free. Would you dare to let me unchain you and lead you up? All : Yes! Up out of the cave? All : Yes! Hi, Daddy. ♪ ♪ Where the f*ck have you been? That's my dad. ♪ ♪ I want you to get on your knees, and I want you to beg your daughter's forgiveness. You will beg. You will grovel at her feet for what you've done to this innocent soul. ♪ ♪ Ugh! Oh! [grunting] [grunting] ♪ ♪ Would you dare to let me unchain you...  Yes! And lead you up, up? Yes! Out of the cave? All : Yes! Would you let me lead you up out of the world of shadows? All : Yes! Will you? Whoo! ♪ ♪ Will you let me lead you into The Light? All : Yes! [cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ [grunting] You wanted to see me? Yeah. You know I love you like a brother, Eddie. Yeah. So I'll get right to it. You having an affair, Eddie? No. No, Sarah just... look. This whole thing is just a big mix-up. Who'd you meet at the motel last night? ♪ ♪ So what did you see, anyway, when you opened the door? ♪ ♪ There is no Light.
