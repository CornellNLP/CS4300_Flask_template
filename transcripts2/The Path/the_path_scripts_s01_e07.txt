 Cal : Previously on "The Path"... 
 I need a good man on the ground in Milton. 
 It's in Delaware. 
 Oh, okay. 
 He's been seeing an IS girl. 
 I'm sorry. I'll offset. 
 Does this mean you've been seeing her and lying to us the whole time? 
 They need our help. 
 They'll find someplace else to go, but it might take a couple days. 
 Okay. 
 I spoke with my dentist, and he needs a receptionist. 
 I could do that. I could be a receptionist. 
 Jason called me. 
 He was inquiring about a clinical test we're running here for fourth stage pancreatic cancer. 
 He wanted to buy the drug. 
 Well, did he say who it was for? 
 No, but it must have been for a person with means. 
 How long has Steve been away righting those wrongs? 
 Months. 
 What are we doing here? 
 Looking for something. 
 You check the balcony. 
 [mouths word] 
 Nothing. 
 Steve would be incredibly excited about some special guests that will be staying here. 
 The sisters couldn't take the risk, but I told them, we will. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 Richard : Where there is transgression, there is also transformation. 
 That's why we offset... to right the wrong. 
 And through this physical act of transforming our Earth, we heal the thing in us that is broken. 
 I stepped out of gathering to follow a girl... 
 An IS girl. 
 Go ahead and plant it. 
 It's freezing. Isn't it gonna die? 
 Winter's the best time to plant a tree. 
 Roots grow strong during the dormant months. 
 [helicopter rumbles] 
 When spring arrives, your tree will be... 
 [rumbling grows louder] 
 Is this it? 
 Is The Future here? 
 That's the compound. 
 [tense piano music] 
 ♪ ♪ I'm standing outside The Meyerist Movement's compound, the extremist religious sect that is harboring six illegal immigrants from Honduras. We're still gathering information, but there appears to be a standoff between the United States government and the members of what many in this community are fearing is a cult. [helicopter drones] ♪ ♪ Excuse me. Have the Hondurans been indoctrinated into the cult? This is not a cult. It's a movement. Any further comments, miss? No. ♪ ♪ [children shouting happily, laughing] Ashley : Okay, I'm going to school. Wait. No, I don't want you going out there. It is not safe. Well, a Novice is dropping me at school, so I'm gonna be fine. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I just... It's just this place. Everyone is so strange here. You didn't want to stay at Hawk's anymore. I know. So... This is temporary. I'm gonna get this job. And we are gonna get out of here. Come here. [children shouting] [door opens] [door closes] Clarissa : Mommy? Are they coming for us? [helicopter whirring] I don't know. [knock at door] Hello? You in there? Holy... Oh, my God! sh1t. Sorry. Nope. That's... I tried knocking. No, no, it's okay. [laughing] I wasn't expecting you. Um... How's it going over at the compound? It sounds terrible. Yeah, I, uh, haven't made it there yet. Listen, I didn't think I'd make it back for a while, so I brought supplies. Oh, my God. Thank you. Salami? Yeah, I wasn't sure if you stayed vegetarian. Are you kidding? Meat is awesome. I haven't been within a mile of bean curd since the day I left. Anyway, um... Look, just don't go outside the cottage. Okay, stay inside, and I will, uh, come and check in on you in a couple days. Um... thank you, Eddie. Yeah. [door closes] They're calling us a controversial fringe movement. Do you know what they do to controversial fringe movements? They set fire to their buildings and stand around and watch them burn. Cal : This is about human beings. Where were you? Long story. Cal : For us to be seen in the world as a Movement with heart, soul, and vision. If we call the government's bluff, we will be seen as a sensitive space. Or another Wako. You acted on your own without support from us. You didn't even discuss it with your fellow URs here. And they all support me 100%. I'm sorry, Cal. It's too dangerous. I agree with Bill and Felicia. We have kids. What about their kids? Back me up here, Eddie. This is a shitshow, Cal. I have to agree with Eddie. I'm sorry. No. [somber music] Felicia and I will watch over New York until this situation is resolved. And who's supposed to tell these innocent people that we're sending them back to endemic poverty and horrific violence? I think it would be appropriate for you to do that. ♪ ♪ [helicopter droning] [indistinct conversations] You nervous about the helicopters? No. Sad about Sean? Look, only the strongest Novices go into the field. He's... he's gonna do great work in Delaware. Yeah, I'm really proud of him. Anyway, you know, if there's anything I can do to help... Man : Panting, breathless. And that's when he sees the spy and he realizes that there is a real true world out there. So he comes back, ranting and raving. "What you think is real isn't! You're a prisoner! Your life isn't real! You're just looking at shadows." Mcclusky : Agent Gaines? Agent Gaines? Man : Would they if they could. Yes, sir. Um... I'm sorry... Did... did you need me? I was... Doing good work. Suddenly, Washington's very interested in these wackos. First Rindge, now this Honduran fiasco. I want to put you on this full-time. Report back to me on a daily basis. That's... that's great. That's great. Thanks, sir. [Bob Dylan's "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"] ♪ ♪ ♪ Temptation's page flies out the door ♪

♪ It's life and life only ♪ ♪ ♪ Your heart is racing. Put that back. I'll get in trouble. [faint indistinct conversations] Thank you. For what? Being a friend. I've been feeling really alone. You don't ever have to feel alone again. You have a good heart. So do you. Maybe. I definitely have a headache. I can get you an Advil. Actually, you know what would really help me? Those have to be authorized. It's okay. They give 'em to me all the time. This would just save me the red tape of setting up a meeting with Richard. But if it's not okay with you... No. It's o... it's okay. Please don't tell anyone. It'll be our little secret. You're awesome. [indistinct conversations] Kids, put that away. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Keep playing. We definitely didn't want to put you to work. You're our guests. Well, um... There's been some concern in the... the upper rungs of our organization that... In doing what I thought was right for you and your children, uh, it would... make our movement too vulnerable. We're not a political movement. We don't follow government or leaders. We follow the Light. The Light directs us. And the Light... The Light... tells me... that I... I have to fight for you. [exhales deeply] Your fate is my fate. But don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you, okay? All right, I'm the leader here. So... [laughs] All right. [inhales deeply] [groans] What's going on? Why were you late to the meeting yesterday morning? I, uh, had a field meeting with a Possible. While there were helicopters hovering over the compound? I didn't think I'd be needed. Well, I did need you. [sighs] For a lot of things. But also, I can't stop thinking about Evelyn and her kids. What if they were our children? Look, Cal f*cked up, okay? It was not the way to help. Everything feels so difficult now. I just can't help but think if you and I were on the same page... [door opens, closes] Okay, you are now officially a Receptive. What size T-shirt? Usually a large. So your initiation fee gives you membership for the year and one free 1R or 2R class. But if you want a 2R class before you've received 1R certification, you'll need approval from the teacher. Personally, I never recommend jumping rungs. Well, then I won't. I'm sorry it's been so crazy around here. Hopefully it will all be over soon. Well, I'm sure the Upper Rungs are taking care of things. They always do. I'm so glad you've decided to spend more time with us. Yeah, I want to spend a lot more time. You know, I'm thinking about living The Ladder. We would love to have you. Mind if I christen this? Oh, we don't christen anything. [laughs] Right. My bad. [chuckles nervously] Seems like a fit to me. We've been in communication with ICE. We all agree the best way to do this is to quietly get the Hondurans to the city to turn themselves in. Bill : Can we arrange to move them tonight? We'll get into it. Has anyone told the refugees they're being moved? Cal : I've spoken to them. And, uh... I told them that they're staying, that we intend to protect them. We need to speak privately. No, no, no, that's actually the opposite of what we need to do. [helicopter droning] What is this? What's going on? The Meyerist Movement was never intended to be three people at the highest rungs duking it out. It was meant to be a circle. Shouldn't we know what our youngest members think? They're closer than anybody else here to being one of those refugees. Okay. Point taken. Thank you all so much. You can leave now. Not yet. I think we need to take a vote that includes all rungs. We'd like to call for a vote. [helicopter droning] Richard. I don't agree with what you're doing. I understand that. It's not a good idea. I believe that this is the right thing for us to do. Excuse me. Just listen to me... May I speak to you privately for a second? We'll talk later. Yes. How could you do this without telling anyone? Bill and Felicia didn't tell me they were coming here to take away my authority. I'm talking about me. Well, I tried talking to you, Sarah. Oh, because I didn't support you, you decided to rogue? So support me now, all right? Do this with me. You know it's the right thing to do. That is all I ever do, is support you here. You seem to be so progressive, but when it comes to the sexes, it's like we're in the 1950s. Woman in the shadows while we're still supporting the men. If you're in the shadows, it's because you put yourself there. You want to be a leader? Be one. Russel : Hey, Dad. Got a strange call. Someone staying up at your cabin? This time of year? No, sir. Cal : What's going on? Someone just saw some blonde woman outside Hank's cabin. I haven't stashed blondes up there since the '70s. Who told you this, Russ? We have a few members who keep an eye on the place. Cal : Uh-huh. Russel : It's probably a mistake. I'll check it out. Cal : Russ... [indistinct conversation] [tense music] ♪ ♪ [helicopter droning] ♪ ♪ [line trilling] Eddie : Hey, it's me. If you get this, get out of there now, okay? Leave! Get someplace safe. Go, go, go! [engine turning over, tires squealing] 
 
 [rock music playing over headphones] ♪ ♪ [tires screeching] Alison! Alison! You have got to get out of here right now. They know you're here. How? Did you go outside? No. I just... Maybe for five minutes to get some fresh air, but nobody saw me. Come on. Wait, wait, wait! Come on! I can explain. I'll talk to you later. Come on, Alison. Come back with me. You can unburden. We'll talk this through. No big deal. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [screaming] Go! [intense music] ♪ ♪ [engine sputtering] [engine turning over] Can we have a real conversation, Eddie? Because I think that you haven't been honest... Not for a long time. I know that you never had an affair with Miranda Frank. I know something else happened to you in Peru. Miranda told me what you said... that there was no Light. When I was in Peru, I had a vision of Steve dying. But it was more than that. I just had a feeling that... this was all bullshit... that there was no Ladder, that there was no Light. Is that true? No. All right. So what happens now? You, uh... you tell Sarah about all this? Huh? I mean, that's what you want, right? Destroy our marriage so you can finally have her? I don't have to destroy your marriage. You're just doing just fine with that on your own. [both breathing heavily] I want you to take The Walk. Steve's Walk? You can't live among us, call yourself a follower, and not believe. You can't have it both ways. It's f*cking December, Cal. You'll do The Walk. And if... if you find after 250 miles that you are still faithless... Keep walking. Don't come back. Don't bring us any more darkness. And if you don't do The Walk, I will tell Sarah everything... about Miranda, about Alison. I'll tell her you don't believe. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Dr. Gottlieb is wonderful. A brilliant dentist and the kindest man you'll ever meet. And this is where you would sit. Looks like home. Doesn't it? So do you have any experience in the dental field? Oh, no. I don't. They said that wasn't a requirement. Oh, that's okay. Tell me about your most recent work experience. Well, actually, I've been a stay-at-home mom for a really long time. And I'm just getting back into the work force. When I did work, it was mostly in the restaurant industry... waiting tables. I know that's not really similar to this. Oh, sweetie, don't worry about it. Sarah Lane sent you. You're hired. Oh, and I forgot tell you the best part of the job. This is where we find the Light when we need it. Woman : These people have been a plague to our God-fearing community. They're bringing looting and theft to our town. Looting? f*ck you, lady. Woman : They're praying in the cafeteria, protesting class teachings, refusing to pledge allegiance to our nation... [door opens] They take in drug addicts and mental patients... Hey. Woman : These people... No teaching is getting done in my daughter's school. They're praying in the cafeteria, protesting class teachings... What happened to you? Oh, um... 7R with Cal. I fell. It's nothing. [liquid pouring] So Cal wants me to do The Walk. What? Why? No one ever gets sent out in the middle of winter. Yeah, well, he wants me to leave soon... like, right away. Why don't you tell me what's really going on? Look, things have been revealed to both of us during 7R which makes it relevant that I do it now. [door closes] Where have you been? Out. With Ashley? Whatever. Hey, don't you talk to your mother with that tone, Hawk. Hey, did you hear me? Yes, sir. Sorry. Don't you dare treat her that way. That is not how our family operates. That is not our path. Maybe your path isn't my path. Hawk. I'll talk to him in the morning. All : You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! [tense music] ♪ ♪ You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! You're not welcome here! Sarah : Evelyn? I'm sorry that the vote will determine whether or not we can harbor you. I sent my children to the U.S. so that they would be safe. Two years we were apart. And they were in the hands of the coyotes. I guess I'm used to not having my fate in my own hands. Joy : I heard your IS girl is gone. What? She and her mom took off in the middle of the night. Disappeared. Who told you that? Like, every single Novice. I told you the IS can never be trusted. They're probably the ones who broke into the infirmary and stole the drugs. [sniffs, sighs] [door opens] Mary. Why'd you send Sean away? Um... Mary, uh... can we talk about this later? We have the vote... No, I want to know now. Why? Um... he was needed in Delaware. I thought you didn't lie here. I thought Truth was the path to The Light. I understand you're upset... What do you want from me, Cal? Who am I to you? You're someone I care about... deeply and, um... and feel for. But I can't... It... it's not right for us to be together the way we have. Then why send Sean away? You told me to be with him. I did it  for  you. And then I started to like him, want to see him, hear his voice, f*ck him. Are you okay, Mary? You're not answering the question. Answer the f*cking question. Why did you send him away? I'm leaving. You have to find someone else you can f*ck with. I'm sure you got plenty of options. Hello, old friend. Silas. What... what are you doing here? I've come to talk to you. Well, I can't. I can't now, 'cause we're gathering. I've traveled a long way, Calvin. Sit with me. Reflect. Let's commune. Bill and Felicia sent you? No. They want me here less than you do. Steve sent me. He isn't happy with you. Steve is half dead. I communicate with him all the time. Well, then he would remind you that he wanted me to lead. There's nothing more to lead. That's what I've come to tell you... and Bill and Felicia. It's over. It was over when Steve could not accept his mortality. I couldn't see it then. I was like you. I wanted to hold on. But it was over. The Movement is dead. [tense music] ♪ ♪ No, no. Um... you don't understand. Um... they're waiting for me, Silas, the next generation. They... they want me. They believe in me. Not after I tell them the truth. No, Steve foretold a miracle to come, a new leader. If there is one, he is not you. I see you, Calvin. ♪ ♪ I always have. ♪ ♪ You're a fraud. ♪ ♪ You can go out there and smile... But you're an alcoholic salesman... just like your father. [dramatic music] [choking and gasping] ♪ ♪ Aah! I spent last night praying to The Light for insight. My prayers led me to The Ladder. "As an outlier in a Judeo-Christian society, we must not risk the perception of extremism and give the government, the church, and the media any excuse to demonize us or destroy us. We must remain invisible heroes to the needy, the poor, the unenlightened, but we must fiercely avoid getting embroiled in political battles with the powers that be, as it will, most certainly, rapidly, and unceremoniously, destroy all that we have built." We are at... a critical and dangerous moment in our history. At such a moment, we must follow the guidance and infinite wisdom of our founder, who has advised that we honor and protect all that we have built. [applause] [indistinct murmuring] Where's Cal? [tense music] I don't know. ♪ ♪ If no one else wishes to speak, it's time to vote. I'd like to speak. Wonderful. [knobs squeaking] ♪ ♪ Thank you, Bill, for sharing... those wise words with us. You're a great inspiration to all of us. But I need to present a different perspective. This is Evelyn Hernandez. She needs our help. And so do her kids. We who follow this path, whether we are a Novice or we have reached the tenth rung, we struggle with our relationship with the outside world. Every time we open our hearts, every time we open our gates, we take a risk. 17 years ago, Steve took a risk on a young man with so much pain and so much anger in his heart that he was willing to kill anything in his path. ♪ If Steve hadn't opened our gates, hadn't taken a chance on him, I wouldn't have found the love of my life. I wouldn't have had my beautiful children. And I wouldn't be me. So I ask when you cast your vote today, you remember that we are all here because someone took a risk on us. Eddie : Let us stay strong for the weak. Be a beacon for the undirected. In times of struggle... We are one. In times of strife... All : We are strong. Sarah : In time of change... All : We remain. Sarah : If darkness falls... All : We are Light. If darkness falls... All : We are Light. ♪ ♪ Sarah : When darkness falls... All : We are light! [applause] [indistinct shouting] ♪ ♪ All : Out! Out! Out! Out! ♪ ♪ Wes : Mary... Mary! Hey, hey, that is my daughter. Mary, you need to come home! Mary! You guys okay? Yep. We're gonna make it work. It's gonna be fine. Okay? Everything's gonna be great. Go inside, and we're gonna... I'll be right back. Ashley. I just need a minute. [sighs] Hi. Hey. Um... What's going on? Why'd you leave? I had to. My... My mom freaked out. Why? 'Cause she said it's a cult and that we had to get out of here. We're helping your family. Yeah, I know you were, but... But what? I can't see you anymore. What? My mom doesn't want me to. Um, so my mom doesn't want me to see you. Yeah, but it's different. Like, look what's happening to my family. I really need to be there for my mom right now. Ashley, you're the only thing that makes any sense to me. Everything is so messed up. Meg : Ashley! I really just need things to be normal. I have to go. Ashley. Ash... Ashley! [somber music] ♪ ♪ You were amazing today. When you were speaking, I could finally see what you could be here. Hopefully they won't set fire to the compound tonight. Well, if they do, it will have been for all of the right reasons. So how'd it feel, inspiring all those people? Good. Really good. [sighs] I'm gonna miss you. Miss you so much. It's gonna be long and hard. But it will end, and you will come back. Take comfort in knowing that. [knock at door] Hawk. Honey, what's wrong? [inhales deeply] I want to come with you. What? I want to Walk. I want to Walk with you. Son, you, uh... you do this alone. Please. I need to. I'm lost. I'm so lost. ♪ ♪ [phone beeping] [line trilling] ♪ ♪ It's Cal. Leave a message. Cal, where the f*ck have you been? I need you to tell me. I need you to tell me why you're sending Eddie on The Walk. ♪ ♪ [coughs] [groans, coughs]
