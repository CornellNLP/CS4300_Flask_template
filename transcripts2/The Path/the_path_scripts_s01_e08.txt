 Previously on "The Path"... 
 They're calling us a controversial fringe movement. 
 This is Evelyn Hernandez, and these are her kids. 
 She needs our help. 
 Sarah : If darkness falls... 
 All : We are Light. 
 I was looking for Sean. 
 I need a good man on the ground in Milton. 
 Why did you send him away? 
 [vase shatters] 
 You work in the infirmary, right? 
 Uh-huh. 
 You know what would really help me? 
 Cal : You haven't been honest. 
 You said there was no Light. 
 I want you to take the Walk. 
 And if you find that you are still faithless, don't come back. 
 I can't see you anymore. 
 I want to walk with you. 
 Son, you, uh... 
 Please. 
 I need to. 
 Silas, what are you doing here? 
 It's over. The Movement is dead. 
 You're an alcoholic salesman. 
 [gagging] 
 Argh! 
 No, no, no!

They got buses that go back all the time. I'm sure. Well, this is it. This is where it all began. You know, Steve was doing top secret psychological warfare in there... experimenting on soldiers, Vietnam vets. And one day it hits him. This is messed up. And he just walks out through those gates, leaving his life in the Army behind. Well, leaving everything else as well. No idea what was ahead of him. Just knew he couldn't do what he was doing anymore. Can I assist you gentlemen? Uh, no thank you, sir. We're just... You mind taking your hands out of the bags, please? Yeah, we're just on a walk.

[laughter] All right, I'm gonna go put these in some water. Thank you. Felicia : Sarah, Sarah... I'd love to have a little private chat with you later, woman to woman.

Felicia : Cal is reckless, and he will bring The Movement down. His demons will get the better of him. No one has seen him since last night. And this is not the first time he's been unpredictable recently. Isn't that so? It's been a challenging time. I know you and Cal have a special relationship. But this is bigger than that. Change is coming, as Steve prophesied, at the highest levels of our Movement. I just want you to breathe a little on the possibility of taking a bigger leadership role when that change comes. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Silas... That does resemble one of his... ♪ ♪ One of his Pachamama idols. But what is it doing here? ♪ ♪ Abe : Look at these whackos. This is ridiculous. Yeah, you can imagine what it's costing the taxpayers. I can't believe we're wasting our resources on this. Carter : It's bullshit. Come on, turn that sh1t off. Carter : Why are you so upset? Because it's nonsense. It's just a bunch of political theater. I thought you were against deporting the aliens. First of all, it's undocumented. No one says aliens anymore. Jesus. You know, nothing's getting solved here. It's just Uncle Sam kicking a can down the road as per usual. When you have a murderous cult doing more good than they are, then you know we got problems. You don't have a murder case yet, do you? I'm working on it. Yeah, I sent out to get Jason Kemp's police report, but it's... you know, getting paperwork out of Peru is worse than FEMA. Agent Gaines, mind if I have a word? Uh, yeah. Of course. I was wondering if you could find the time to have a meal with me... a thank you for all your hard work. Wow, boss wants to take me to lunch. You know I have no problem with that. Well, I was thinking dinner. You and your wife join me and the missus at a club, say, tomorrow night? Of course, of course. You know, I just, uh, need to check the calendar, but, um... Well, let me know. Mm-hmm. Well, you know... well, you know, you know, I... I... I'll check... check the calendar. Carter : My, my, my. Someone's moving up in the world. It's just a thank you dinner. At his private club? No way. This is a promotion, you piece of sh1t. You bring in one big case... It's just a dinner. Fredericks : All I'm saying is, I've never been invited to his private club. Of course not. I mean, man, look at you. How long have you had that jacket? [laughter] It's not vegetarian. No, it is not. Just 'cause we're hungry doesn't mean we should eat... We take what we are given. Come on. [sighs] [dramatic music] Nice boots. Better keep those on tonight. Easy, friend. I ain't your friend.

But for some of us, it's a nourishing way to start the day. So join in if you know it. Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive, it is pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is dying that we are born to eternal life. How about a "thank you, Mommy"? Daddy's are a lot fluffier. You haven't even tried it. Just taste it. And he makes banana eyes and a blueberry mouth. Hey, I invented the blueberry mouth. What, you don't believe me? Watch this. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Cal? Where have you been? I need help. Okay. Come on. Let's go straight upstairs, okay? You can take a shower; you can put on something of Eddie's. Sarah... Let's just get you cleaned up, all right? Come with me. You're here. Cal came and got me. He did? Why? He said this was where I'm supposed to be. [uplifting music] ♪ ♪ [smooth jazz music playing] ♪ ♪ Mcclusky : Thank you, William. Jocelyn : This is so nice. Mrs. McClusky : Thanks for coming here. It's just easier. We never go to restaurants anymore. You can't hear yourself talk. Abe : We don't go anywhere anymore, period. Jocelyn : Kids. Mcclusky : We'll all do the pot pie, William. Thanks. It's Thursday. ♪ ♪ Thank you. Well, Abe. I want to thank you for your outstanding service to the department. Your hard work and your excellent instincts have done us proud. Thank you. And your family has made sacrifices. And I want to thank you both personally for that... and to give you some news. We are officially done with the Meyerist case. Excuse me, I'm... I'm not following. Well, with all the press around the immigrant standoff, State Senator De Graw took an interest. He got Homeland Security involved. So they'll be taking over from here. Um... No, this is a good thing. Our department did the leg work. We get the credit for that, and now DHS handles it. What's this State Senator De Graw? Isn't that the guy that's making a play for Attorney General? [chuckling] Well, I try to stay out of that. No, but you and I know what that is. Honey, I don't think... It's politics. This is not about enforcing the law. It's just some idiot politician decides... Abe... No. You know what? I'm sorry. But do you know what's gonna happen? Nothing. This case gets kicked over to the IRS... for years. We're talking about a potential murder that these people have committed. I mean, at least one. Maybe more. It's typical government bullshit. Agent Gaines, I'm gonna have to ask you to watch your language. The only thing more f*cked up than DHS is FEMA. So maybe they can bring those guys in and get my f*cking house fixed! Abe, if you can't get a hold of yourself- You know what? I f*cking hate pot pie! [napkin smacks table] ♪ ♪ One tea, two mugs. Anything else? Eddie : That is it. Thank you. [easy listening music] ♪ ♪ We could split one piece. We have enough. Uh, for now. But we don't know what's coming. So I think that we can probably make it to the next shelter tonight. But if not, I think we should probably stay here until it warms up a little. ♪ ♪ [sighs] Did you stop loving Mom? Buddy... When you had your thing with... I know what you're gonna say. ♪ ♪ 
 
 My... Transgress in Peru had nothing to do with the love I have for your mother. Come on. I-I tell you stuff... real stuff, and you talk to me like that... like we're in session. Hey, that's the truth. Come on. What... what happened? I mean, if I can't even have pie, just... Look, I was just going through something where I was trying to find where I really belong... if that makes any sense. Did you? Did you find... [sighs] What you were looking for? ♪ ♪ Where are you boys headed? Excuse me? We saw you outside in the freezing cold. Surely you're headed somewhere. Thought it would be Christian thing to do to offer you ride. Oh. Wow, well, that is very kind of you, but, uh, we are actually on a walk, so... Woman : In the middle of winter? We are headed to Brighton Beach, so if you are going anywhere in that direction... Brighton Beach? My dad grew up there. Man : No kidding. Well, not really. We used to go to Coney Island as a kid, you know, summers. Get into trouble. Is that where you are going now? We have a couple of, uh, warm spots in the back seat for you. ♪ ♪ It's fate, Dad. Come on. ♪ ♪ [sighs] [panting] [sniffs] [rasping] [vomiting] [toilet flushing] Mom, is Uncle Cal gonna be okay? Go back to bed, honey. It's late. What's wrong with him? Did he transgress? Not every illness is of spirit. Some are just of body. How you doing? Uh, better, yeah. Sorry if I, uh, disturbed you. No, I was up. Nicole's been texting me. It sounds like she's in early labor. I might head over there soon. All right. You woke me up. You sound awful. It's... it's all right. It's just leaving your system. I'll get you some more water. Good night, honey. Are you gonna stay with us until Daddy gets back? He's gonna stay with us until he gets feeling better. We help people who need us, right? Like the immigrants. Like the immigrants. [rasping] I'm not... I'm not all right. Come here. I want to show you something. What am I looking at? Donations... from the website. This is how much came in from the beginning of the year. This is how much came in today. It's staggering. [sighs] It's money. I know it's just money, but each of these comes from a person... an eager new soul ready to believe because of you. Now, I know this weakness you have for alcohol is the rock that you carry. We all have them. But I just want you to know... that every period of transition... [foreboding music] Every change is difficult, sometimes even painful, but you were right. They saw us as a "sensitive place." We're legitimate, and everything you ever hoped for for The Movement, we're on the verge of. We're going to be a powerful force in the world. ♪ ♪ It's all coming true. ♪ ♪ [horn honks] Eddie : I have not been here in so long. Nobody here. Yeah. Freak show? They don't still have that, do they? Tattooed lady? I think it's just some old signs. What's a funnel cake? [laughs] You've never been to any place like this, have you? [laughing] Should we put a rock down? Uh... it's not one of the sacred sites. I mean, but it kind of is... for you. You worried? We're too far off track. You're worried. No, it's, um... it's gonna be fine. [sighs] [dark music] We can just walk faster. You know? I mean, you said it. When Doc did this, he didn't know what was next. He just knew he couldn't stay where he was. Did I say that? Yeah. ♪ ♪ Whoa, Dad. ♪ ♪ There's just a lot of memories here. But, um... good ones though, right? ♪ ♪ With my brother, yeah. ♪ ♪ Are you gonna be okay? ♪ ♪ Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh... it's good. Come on. ♪ ♪ Eddie : Oh, the Wonder Wheel. There's this Russian deli that Johnny used to steal beer from. And we'd get the perfect buzz on and ride that thing all day long, until we were sick. That doesn't sound at all smart. Nah, it wasn't. [chuckles] Oh, my God. This game here? Mmhmm? Johnny figured out if you put just the perfect spin on the ball... hit the back rim... it goes in every time. Isn't that cheating? No. Well... [laughing] Yeah, maybe. It's just gaming the system. But you'd get the big teddy bears. The teddy bears would get the girls. And you'd take the girls down to the beach, and... you know, I shouldn't be telling you any of this. Ha! [smacks counter] [laughing] Sorry, had to. Um... I'm, uh... I love this stuff. Like, what... you never tell me these stories. You don't ask. I did when I was a kid. But it always seemed to bum you out. Ah. Oh, no way. I totally forgot about those. What are they? Clam rolls. Only the greatest thing you can eat on this planet, bar none. Aw, $11! That's highway robbery. They were four bucks when I was a kid... five with a Coke. Well, we should get some. Nah, that's practically all we have left. Aw... I mean, if they're the best thing you've ever had... [sighs] Nah, it's all right. Hawk... Hawk! Two clam rolls, please. You buying? He's buying. Oh, yes. Yes, I am. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [children chattering] [ball thumps] [children laughing] You come back up... Nico, I'm gonna get you. Come back upstairs, you're... she's trying to have a baby! No running! Can somebody get them to stop acting like animals? I dove on top of Summer just in time... Oh, how frightening. But when I look up, it's not Summer. It's the Pachamama idol. Like that one that showed up in your office? Exactly. Okay, major wave coming. Have you thought about what it means? I think it's pretty clear. You know? I've been anxious about Hawk being away and his safety... That's too literal. I mean, you're not just you in your dreams. You're everything, including that Pachamama. Maybe you're the one holding yourself back, afraid to embrace your true power. Can it not be about Sarah for a second? I'm trying to have a f*cking baby here! I'm so sorry, sweetie. Let's move you... Here, here, here. Into a more comfortable position. Russel : Come on, guys. No tag in the birth environment. The baby needs to enter a peaceful space, not a... sorry, babe. What is wrong with this one? Oh, none of mine have taken this long. She should be popping out by now. Every baby has its own journey. [sighs] Gaby : Hey, Cal. You're already here for the ceremony. We have no soul to induct yet, I'm afraid. Anything I can do? You can get my kids to shut the f*ck up. Russel doesn't seem too capable. Honey... It's okay. Anger can be a good engine sometimes, all right? We need to channel whatever energy we have right now. Nicole : [sighs] We can call you when the baby comes. No, I want to stay. I want to... want to be of help. [sighs] Ohhh... Remember, the pain is not bigger than you. It is you. [moaning] Sarah : Let it go. You're good. Nicole : [moaning] Eddie : Mmm. You know... part of me thought that these cannot be that good. You know, it's probably just the memory. No, they're awesome. Right? Oh. The greasy, crunchy bit... I mean, it's so... so terrible, but it's perfect. Thank you! [laughing] When did you know? About... You always hear the Elders talking about the moment when they felt it. Like, the Light just coming through them. I'll have to think about that one. Was it when you took your vows? Everyone says when it happens, you just know. Like, all their questions are just gone. There's this clarity. I mean, no more questions, no more pain, just... Joy said... she could feel her body lifting off the ground. Like, she could feel it. I don't think I've ever had that feeling, actually. Well, at least not in The Movement. Closest thing to it was probably when I met your mom. [chuckles] You know, she can just lift all my doubts and pain just by looking at me. Hm. [melancholy music] Hey, hey, don't. Don't do that. I love her. I know you just think it's a Transgress, but I love Ashley. She makes me feel like that... like it might all be okay. And when she's not here, I just feel so empty and awful, and...
