Don't. Nicky : Diego? My mom says that israel's an. Outdated concept. Rob : Thank you for watching. These two episodes of "childrens hospital." A lot of people ask me where I got the idea for "childrens hospital," and. It's a funny story, actually. Uh, my daughter -- my 2-year-old. Daughter dislocated her. Shoulder, and we had to bring. Her to a children's hospital. And I just remember, like, the. Waiting room was terrifying. It was, uh, full of nervous. Parents, most of them crying, You know, and, uh... All pale. This isn't the funny part. But, um, this gurney -- this. Tiny little gurney comes. Crashing through the door, and. It's surrounded by doctors and. Nurses, and they're yelling, and. They look really scared, and. There's this...Tiny body on. The gurney. The funny part's coming. And, uh, and there's this. Life flight pilot, this. Helicopter pilot behind the. Gurney. And, uh, and he looks at me, And he goes, "mondays, right?" [ laughs ] He didn't actually say that. So, then I made a tv show about it.
