 [ Inhales sharply, grunts ] 
 Ohh. 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Smart you didn't run. 
 Kopus : No uniform today? 
 Oh, uh, I'm not a cop today. 
 Junior told us what really happened with Mac. 
 Said he caught you trying to flee the scene. 
 Junior : We're not letting outsiders handle our business. 
 We're here to make you confess. 
 Yeah? 
 And then what? You gonna hang me? 
 Stanley : That's not a bad idea. 
 Tell the truth, and take what comes. 
 sh1t, Junior. 
 You rounded up yourself a hell of a posse, here. 
 I hope you brought something to do it with 'cause I really don't like your odds. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Coughs ] 
 Oh, hell. A bat? 
 Come on, Frank. You're gonna give the kid nightmares. 
 Give him a gun. 
 [ Coughs ] 
 Frank : Hit him, Junior. 
 I won't hurt you if you just confess. 
 If I confess, then I'd be lying. 
 I can't lie to you, Junior. 
 Come on, Junior. You can do better than that. 
 Give me that. 
 Aah! Ohh. 
 Ohh. Ohh. 
 Ooh! 
 Aah! [ Grunts ] 
 [ Taser crackling ] 
 Kopus : Aah! 
 You don't have to do that. 
 Back off, Junior. 
 Last chance. 
 I didn't kill him. 
 Oh. 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Coughs ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Aschell. Jensen. 
 FBI wants us to help them find Junior Van Der Veen. 
 Nobody up there will talk to 'em. 
 And what are we supposed to do? 
 'Cause they don't talk to us, either. 
 What do they want him for? 
 They want us to make him reconfirm his statement. 
 Just something to put the pressure on. 
 Get him a little closer to turning on his scumbag brother. 
 Didn't you say you were going to the Chief's wake? 
 I know the family a little bit. 
 Kid might be there. 
 Well, I'm not gonna grab him at a wake. 
 I can. 
 What, and start a riot? 
 Be happy to do that for you, Captain. 
 If you can do it discreetly-- 
 No, I got it. 
 I got it. 
 Okay. Thanks, guys. 
 Harold. 
 You bring this kid in, it's gonna look real good. 
 You read me? 
 I'll find him. 
 [ Baby crying ] 
 Good afternoon, Mrs. Jensen. 
 Hello. It's been eight weeks. 
 You can check, but it's been eight weeks. 
 Eight weeks and three days. You're slacking. 
 Kopus : I need to see a doctor. 
 Fill out both pages, both sides. But it'll be a while. 
 Any way to move this along? 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Like I said... it'll be a while. 
 [ Baby crying ] 
 [ Person coughs ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Coughs ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Sniffles, coughs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Coughing continues ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Woman over PA ] 
 [ Indistinct chatter ] 
 [ Person coughs ] 
 Hey. 
 Oh, well... Had a little run-in with a half-assed lynch mob. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm donating blood. Is that tar? 
 Smells, don't it? 
 I shouldn't have left you in the woods that time. 
 I wouldn't have done it if I'd known you were sick. 
 Really, I didn't know. 
 No, it's okay. It's my fault. I should have told you. 
 They let you give blood? 
 Don't they have you taking drugs? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Antipsychotics. 
 Sounds like something  I  need, not you. 
 Don't tell them, because if you tell them, they might not let me give. 
 It doesn't taint the blood, but they still don't let you. 
 Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody. 
 It's our secret. 
 I don't know. 
 You sure those doctors didn't make a mistake? 
 No, no mistake. There's plenty wrong with me. 
 If you say so. 
 You were in prison? 
 Yeah, just for a year. 
 Oh, well, that's nothing, so... 
 [ Indistinct conversations continue ] 
 Why you giving blood, anyways? 
 I'm trying to feel useful. 
 They don't trust me to do much these days. 
 Can't say I blame them, but... 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I wouldn't trust me, either. 
 Yeah, I know the feeling. 
 [ Smacks lips, sighs ] 
 I have to go meet Harold. 
 I hope things get better for you. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 [ Baby fussing ] 
 [ Man chanting ] 
 [ Men chanting ] 
 Medicine woman : My father, your kingdom is the earth and sky. 
 He journeys west through all seasons to know your great power. 
 Amay. 
 All : Amay. 
 [ Drums beating rapidly ] 
 [ Men chanting ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 I hope you don't mind us being here. 
 We just wanted to offer our support. 
 Appreciate you coming. 
 I'm sorry. I lost my brother, too. 
 I know how hard it is. 
 Thank you. 
 Is Junior here? 
 Haven't seen him since the night it happened. 
 He's like Mac-- prefers to go through things alone. 
 Somebody from the FBI came by looking for Junior. 
 Is that why you're here? 
 I'm just paying my respects. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 - Kii ha koolamalsi. - Hmm. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Are they speaking to you now? 
 Who? 
 The ones who live in your head. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 Word went around after your settlement with the Morgans. 
 I-I'm sorry. I knew I shouldn't have come. 
 It was-- it's insulting for me to be here. 
 You shouldn't be so angry with yourself. 
 I have a cousin with schizophrenia. 
 He's been asked to endure so much. 
 Tried a lot of traditional and Native treatments. 
 Really? W-what kind of Native treatments? 
 Can we go home? 
 I think I just ate squirrel. 
 [ Chuckles ] I think it might be venison, dear. 
 [ Chuckles lightly ] 
 Marie? 
 Marie. 
 My condolences. 
 Mac was one of a kind. 
 Yes. 
 I've heard you're to be named interim chief. 
 I've been asked. Hasn't been decided. 
 I've been busy... burying my brother. 
 Mac and I had our differences in the past. 
 No use denying it. 
 On that, we can agree. 
 We had moved on. 
 We recently had good talks about building a casino here. 
 Mac was coming around. 
 Knew I had access to architects, builders, casino management. 
 I could help get everything off the ground. 
 Mac would never agree to a casino. 
 Neither will I if I'm chief. 
 Never say never, Marie. People change. 
 Not so sure about that. 
 Is-is Junior here? 
 You dare show up here? Get your sorry ass out. 
 I didn't kill him. 
 [ Dog barking in distance ] 
 [ Car door closes ] 
 [ Car door closes, engine turns over ] 
 [ Car door slams ] 
 [ Footsteps approaching ] 
 I heard you were the victim of vigilante justice. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 You recognize any of the guys that did it? 
 A couple of them seemed kind of familiar. 
 Well, you should tell Frank. 
 He's heading up the Tribal Police force. 
 Maybe I will. Thank you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Well, I can't be seen talking to you now, or ever, really. 
 Understood. 
 Well, sorry he died. 
 Sorry for you, I mean. 
 I did respect him, though. 
 Maybe even liked him a little. 
 You're starting to sound a little guilty. 
 Oh, maybe I need a lawyer. 
 Oh, no "maybe" about it. 
 I wouldn't have killed a guy just for kicking me off of his damn tribe. 
 That's not why you would do it, though. 
 You're working for those guys in Atlantic City, right? 
 Mac said they were friends of your father's? 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 You think someone's gonna hire me to kill somebody with this thing on? 
 What did Mac have going on with Atlantic City? 
 Come on. 
 I'd like to go back to the time when only half the people on this mountain wanted me dead. 
 They thought he might be interested in gaming. 
 They were trying to bribe him, get him to withdraw our recognition bid. 
 And then what are they afraid of us for? 
 We're 26 miles from Manhattan. 
 If we build a casino, we're gonna siphon off a good chunk of their customers. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Chains clinking ] 
 Guard : All right, you got five minutes. 
 [ Handcuffs click ] 
 [ Chuckling ] Christ, it's good to see you. 
 So good. 
 This a blessed day. 
 It's a  blessed  day. 
 They told me I wasn't allowed no visitors. 
 You're not. 
 Oh. 
 I know a guy in the Walpole PD. 
 He got the warden to make an exception. 
 That's good. 
 I knew you'd find a way. 
 I'm not here to talk. 
 I just want to ask you a question, and then you can go back to dying in a box. 
 I love you. 
 No, you're a good boy, Phillip. 
 I want you to know that. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 The Chief was murdered. 
 Marie's brother? 
 Yes. 
 That's a shame. 
 It's a shame when people die, even people as dumb as him. 
 The tribe's been recognized, and I heard your buddies in Atlantic City were worried about competition. 
 Oh. Maybe they are. 
 So, do you know anything about that? 
 [ Sighs ] You got to pay. 
 Come on. 
 If you want to know, you got to pay. 
 One year inside, and you're already cracking up. 
 If you don't, somebody else will. 
 Sounds like something's happening out there. 
 And you ain't the only one with a pal in the Walpole PD. 
 I'll tell you one thing, though, nobody's building sh1t on that mountain. 
 Why's that? 
 'Cause it's a burial ground. Ghosts get angry. 
 Hey, your old man is in-- in chains... like a slave. 
 And that doesn't bother you? 
 This is your last stop. You're gonna die in this place. 
 That makes me happy. 
 Hmm. 
 If a man die, shall he live again? 
 Right. 
 That's all you got to do now-- read the Bible. 
 It's a good book. You should, too. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You know you was conceived in the back of a truck between a church and a graveyard? 
 I'd tell you to go kill yourself, but I know you don't have the balls. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 If you're here, then you're desperate, so come back with some money. 
 [ Clicks tongue ] 
 I'm not coming back. 
 Oh, yes you are. 
 Maybe not on purpose, but you will. 
 I pray every night that you end up in here with me, and I know God's listening. 
 Hey. What happened with Mike? 
 How'd you kill him? You bury him up there, too? 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 
 
 
 [ Laughs ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Car console dinging ] 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Man coughing ] 
 [ Man groans ] 
 Hmm. 
 Bitterroot. 
 Just tuck it between your gum and cheek. 
 It will help ease your arthritis pain. 
 Okay. 
 [ Speaks Native language ] 
 Hmm. All right. 
 Matthew will help you now. 
 Thank you. 
 It's a beautiful day out, Mr. De Freese. 
 Let's go outside. 
 Kii ha koolamalsi. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I realize I probably should have called. 
 Oh. I was wondering if you were gonna look me up. 
 Hmm. 
 You had mentioned Native treatments that helped your cousin-- the one who's like me? 
 Yes. 
 He tried a lot of different things before he finally found something that worked. 
 [ Cup thuds ] 
 So, it was medicine that helped him? 
 Not medicine. 
 He let the voices in. 
 I'm not sure I understand. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 For one hour a day, you find somewhere that's private, and you stop fighting. 
 You welcome in whatever comes-- voices, visions. 
 Turn nothing away, no matter how much it scares you. 
 No, if I welcome them, they'll just keep coming. 
 They'll think I want them to stay, and my head will explode. 
 Hmm. 
 What if I lose control? 
 Maybe it's not for you. 
 Like I said, Matthew tried many things. 
 You'll find your own path. 
 Matthew, that young man, is your cousin? 
 Yes. 
 He works as my aide now. 
 He's a big help. 
 But more importantly, his spirit is happy. 
 Warren : So, how you doing on tracking down that kid? 
 Well, he wasn't at the wake, but I got a good lead. 
 Good. 
 So, I, uh, spoke to the Mayor. 
 Talked up you helping the feds out on this. 
 Appreciate that. 
 I mean, you supporting me, that means a lot. 
 I guess the fact that you and I are once again having lunch together means that you making friends at the department was a bust. 
 I just want to do my job, you know? 
 They don't have to like me. 
 You don't want to be captain ahab. 
 Wait until you get the job first. 
 [ Cup thuds ] 
 Hmm. 
 What the hell are you gonna do when you retire, anyway, besides driving Dorothy nuts? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Well, I've been driving Dorothy nuts since the fourth grade. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Now I guess it'll just be my full-time gig. 
 Doctor says she's almost well enough to travel. 
 I want to take her somewhere nice. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. [ Clears throat ] 
 Better get to it. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Engine turns off ] 
 Marie around? 
 Eddie : - Nope. 
 I need to borrow that dog. 
 Who borrows a dog? 
 A dog molester. 
 Yeah, very funny. 
 That right? 
 You some kind of weirdo dog pervert? 
 It's for the investigation. 
 My department's assisting the FBI. 
 What's to investigate? Kopus is right up the road. 
 Well, the dog was all over the crime scene. 
 He may have gotten DNA evidence on him. 
 Come on. 
 [ Dog panting ] 
 Attaboy. 
 [ Metal clanking ] 
 [ Dog barking ] 
 Junior : What are you doing with Mac's dog? 
 He was the only one willing to help me find you. 
 You been camping out here? 
 Living, not camping. 
 The FBI needs to talk to you. 
 I need you to come with me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 No, thanks. 
 Are you afraid of Kopus? You don't need to be. 
 I'll make sure he stays far away from you. 
 I'm not afraid of him. 
 Then come with me. 
 I don't trust the FBI any more than I trust cops. 
 This is not just gonna go away. 
 I  found you. 
 Eventually, they're gonna find you, too. 
 Oh, here we go. 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Cup thuds ] 
 [ Door slams ] 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 I heard you agreed to be interim chief. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Tell them you changed your mind. 
 There's people in Atlantic City who think you're gonna put a casino up here, put them out of business. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Which means they're gonna lean on you. 
 I think they killed Mac. 
 My brother wasn't involved with the mob, Phillip. 
 Do you have a gun in the house? 
 Eddie : We can take care of Marie just fine. 
 Nobody needs you. 
 You're the one we need to protect her from. 
 You need to learn how to shut your mouth, Eddie. 
 Oh, you interested in teaching me? 
 Oka-- okay, stop. 
 Yeah, I have a gun. 
 And I'm a good shot, as you well know. 
 I'm gonna watch the house as much as I can, but if they want to get to you, they're gonna get to you. 
 You can't be doing this, anyways. 
 You're sick. 
 I'm in remission, Phillip. I'm fine. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 [ Light switch clicks ] 
 [ Timer ticking ] 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 Woman :  There's only one soul between you. 
 Black eggs grow inside you. [ Exhales sharply ] Man :  Listen to them. There are twins inside. You can hear one eating the other. If I took out your eyes, could you still see? You grew together, but you will die alone. Can she hear us? [ Animal snarls ] You can hear him? Jean, you aren't listening to us, are you? [  Overlapping voices  ] [ Voices stop ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Okay, thanks. We'll take it from here. Yeah, I'm good. Suit yourself. Okay. Junior. The FBI asked us to review your statement with you. All you have to do is answer yes or no. You understand? Just ask me what you're gonna ask me. I don't want to be here any longer than I have to. I'll bet you're getting pretty used to police stations by now. You were in juvi, right? That zoo up in Trenton-- I heard it's pretty rough. I guess. Well, watch out. You're almost 18. Pretty soon, we can start caging you with the big dogs. Just ask him the questions. You stated a few minutes after you found the Chief's body, a truck pulled up driven by your brother, Phillip Kopus. He is not my brother. We got different blood. But you are still saying that you were the first to arrive on the scene. You're still saying that's true. Yes or no. Yes. And you stated this happened around 8:00? Yeah. Now, the Chief disenrolled Phillip after he was arrested last year. Were you aware of that? You have to say it, Junior. No. Has Phillip Kopus ever threatened you? No. Are you aware that he's been connected to three unsolved murders in the state of Florida? You guys-- you always connect us to whatever the hell you don't have an answer for. So then why bother telling us the truth? I mean, that's what you're saying, right? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Can I talk to you for a second? No. So, which part of this statement is false-- all of it or just half of it? Junior, get up. Sit down. You're free to go. If the FBI want to interview you, make sure you have a lawyer with you. What the hell are you doing? Rachel : I-I don't kno-- I'm-- I'm worried, dad. I don't know. No, her car's still here, so maybe she's... [ Sighs ] Harold, you don't have to worry about me. I'm fine. I just went for a walk. Okay. Bye. [ Telephone beeps ] You cut yourself? I know. It's okay. I want to finish your financial-aid forms today. [ Smooches ] [ Doorbell rings ] Don't let that get infected. Would you like some toast? I can make you some. No. No, ma'am. Are you sure? It'll take two seconds. Mom. He said he's good. Thank you... though. Well, if nobody wants anything, I'll just be in the other room. Those are new. You like 'em? Yeah. Cool. You look-- you look pretty. I, um, tried calling you while you were in juvi. But you were always being punished or something. It was just for smoking. I missed you. [ Glass thuds ] Yeah? [ Clears throat ] Um... I'm sorry. Um, are you back at your mom's? No. [ Scoffs ] I'm living outside now, the way my people used to... before, you know, this world turned ugly. You're not living back then, Junior. [ Chuckles ] Yeah, I am. This world-- it's not real. It's just a shadow of the real one. I like that. [ Chuckles ] Did you make it up? No. Listen, why don't you, uh-- why don't you come out, see where I'm living? Okay. I'll call you. I don't have a phone anymore. Mac didn't like them. He said that they're worse than cigarettes. [ Chuckles ] What? Yeah, he gave me this, though. I drew a path for you. [ Knock on door ] [ Harold sighs ] [ Door closes ] Come on, Captain. I'll take you home. Dorothy's probably wondering where you are. Aschell told me that kid was ready to roll on his brother, and you put the goddamn brakes on. Well, Aschell was out of line. I thought you wanted my job. I do. Well, then you find a way to pin it on this kid's brother who we both know belongs in prison. Yeah, I wouldn't do that even if I did think he did it. You willing to throw away your promotion on it? It's not about him. It  is  about him. It's about him and you and that weird connection you two have. I need you to listen to me. I need  you  to take over for me, not Aschell. Why? Because I care about this town. Because I care about the people that live here. So do I. Well, good. Then trust me! Trust me and do what I'm telling you to do. And when the day comes for you to take over for me, then maybe you'll understand. Maybe you'll understand why I needed it to be you. [ Mug clatters ] Why don't you sleep it off in here? Don't let Dorothy see you like this. Don't worry. She won't. [ Door opens ] Hey! [ Scoffs ] What are you-- Kopus : Mike was a friend of mine. It's no big deal. Don't worry. There's no strings attached. I just owed Mike. [ Car door opens, closes ] [ Telephone ringing ] Hello? Woman : Is Harold Jensen there? No, I'm sorry. He's not here right now. I'm not sure if you remember me. This is Dorothy Warren's niece. Yes. Of course I remember you. We met at Dorothy's birthday party. How are-- I'm calling because Aunt Dorothy passed away today. [ Sighs ] I don't believe it. Dorothy seemed to be doing so much better lately. I know. But my aunt was a pretty private person. I think she may have known the end was coming but didn't want to burden anyone. He's in shock, I think. Thank you again for relieving me so I can put my little ones to bed. I'll be back first thing in the morning. [ Door opens, closes ] Can I get you some food? I could heat you up some soup, or there's some nice banana bread. Warren : I-I don't need you to worry about me. Want to make sure Dorothy is gonna be okay. Promise me everything will be nice for Dorothy-- top-notch. Of course. I promise. They, uh... [Clears throat] .. want me to bring something for her to wear. Could you pick out something nice for me? I'm not good at that kind of stuff. I'll take-- I'll take care of it. [ Bird cawing ] [ Sighs ] sh1t. [ Vehicle approaches ] What did your father say? Not much. Hey, I stuck my neck out to get you in there 'cause you said he had information. He told me it was probably the mob. Probably? Yeah. He says he knows something about the mountain-- something big. I don't think he's bluffing, but he ain't gonna give it up unless he's getting paid. [ Chuckles ] Really? He doesn't know sh1t. Now, I need you to listen to me. There's a train that's about to run your ass over, and I'm done standing in front of it. You think I don't know when I'm being played? Hey, man, you can't search my house. You don't have jurisdiction. Yeah, you're right. Too bad this isn't your house. Some kids got in there and made a mess. That's all. Hmm. Looks like somebody tossed the place. Kids, huh? They tore it up pretty good. Some big-ass kids. What do you think they were looking for? Drugs, probably. I don't know. You know, Junior is this close to getting sent back to juvi for you. Like you haven't done enough to screw his life up already. Oh, yeah, that's something coming from you, Lieutenant. [ Coat hangers clacking ] [ Sighs ] I know Dorothy liked these, especially the yellow one. Yeah, she called it her daffodil dress. Well, I can bring it to the dry-cleaners and get it pressed first thing in the morning and then bring it over to the funeral home. Whenever Dorothy would wear that yellow dress, she'd, uh, make me wear my gray suit. I guess they were a match. Could you... take the suit in, as well? Of course. Yes. Do you need me to do anything else for you? Yeah. Hand me that-- that blanket there in the basket. Thank you. Thank you, sweet Jean, for everything. Well... I argued with Harold earlier. I'm sorry. It's not important. Harold will understand. That's okay. That's okay. Y-you can leave those. Leave those. [ Voice breaking ] Bill, I'm-- I'm so sorry about Dorothy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I killed my wife. You don't have to stay. It's over. Dorothy's at peace. [ Coat hangers clack ] No, I want to stay. I'll just call Harold to tell him where I am. No. A lo-- a lot of people coming over in the morning. I want to be by myself. Please. [ Car door closes, engine turns over ] [  The Zombies' "Hung Up On A Dream"  ] ♪  well, I remember yesterday  ♪
