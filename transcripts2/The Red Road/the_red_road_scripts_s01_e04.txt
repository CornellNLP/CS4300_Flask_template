 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 [Sighs] 
 What? 
 You look good. 
 How do you feel? 
 Different. 
 Better. 
 I don't know-- it's hard to explain. 
 But, better? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Good. 
 You look tired. 
 I am tired. 
 [Sighs] 
 You look old, Harold. 
 I am old-- so are you. 
 Yeah, but you look old. 
 I'll try leaving you home alone with the kids for two weeks-- see how you turn out. 
 Are they killing you? 
 They are staying with your parents for a bit. 
 Rachel's on lock-down. 
 Katie's an angel. 
 Yeah, where did she come from? 
 Got me. 
 Everything's okay for you at work? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, there's a lot goin' on. 
 Everybody's puttin' in a lot of over-time. 
 Still nothing about the college kid? 
 No. 
 His poor parents. 
 I love looking at your face. 
 I missed you. 
 Me, too. 
 I want you to look at this. 
 These are the dump areas I've identified myself. 
 I talked to Sky last week. 
 She said the next step is to get statements from every person in the tribe who's gotten sick. 
 This is a waste of your efforts, Marie. 
 How's that? 
 You don't have what it takes right now to force anybody to clean this up. 
 Which is why we need to document what we know and file a lawsuit. 
 The tribe gets recognition, then maybe we got a chance. 
 Without it, we're spinnin' our wheels. 
 The driver was making a delivery, when two armed men stole the truck at gunpoint. 
 Authorities have no comment on any possible connection between this hijacking and the robbery at Hudson River Nursing Home last week. 
 The MediScripts truck, which was delivering more than 50 cases of pharmaceuticals, has not been located. 
 Good? 
 Let's go. 
 How come you didn't want the kid in on this one? 
 I didn't need him. 
 Surprised. 
 It seems like he's everywhere, these days. 
 Well, the kid's smart. 
 I'm smart, too. 
 No, you're not. 
 [Collective chatter] 
 Hey, can you talk to me for a second? 
 I thought I was a spoiled, little, white girl. 
 I'm sorry-- look at me. 
 What do you want me to say? 
 Say you love me. 
 Junior. 
 I love you, all right? 
 I'm worried about you. 
 Why don't you answer my texts? 
 Are you still hanging around with him? 
 That doesn't matter. 
 Yeah, it does. 
 I know I acted like it didn't before, but it does. 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I never should've taken you with me to, uh, buy the-- you know, I'd never let anything bad happen to you. 
 I told you how I was listening to those tapes... the one from my mom's brother, the one who died. 
 Yeah. 
 I think he knew Kopus. 
 So? 
 So, it's just... 
 I don't wanna do anything to hurt my mom. 
 So, I'm the reason why your mom's all messed up? 
 No. 
 No. 
 I am. 
 If it was just you and me, there wouldn't be any problems. 
 But, it's not. 
 It'll never just be us. 
 You like somebody else? 
 I don't wanna be with anybody, Junior. 
 Right, right-- I don't blame you. 
 I'm never gonna be anything, anyway. 
 I'm not gonna graduate, and I'm not gonna get a good job. 
 You know I don't think that. 
 I gotta go. 
 [Sighs] 
 Junior. 
 Hello? 
 Daniel, thanks for callin' back. 
 Look, I got a favor to ask, and you owe me about 50. 
 You got a nephew that, uh, works with the DEA, right? 
 Good. 
 I want you to put the two of us in touch. 
 I got a tip for him. 
 Could be mutually beneficial. 
 And don't make me wait too long. 
 Today. 
 [Siren blares] 
 No helmet. 
 You afraid of messing up your hair? 
 If you need to give me a ticket, go ahead. 
 Thanks. 
 Rachel and me broke up, if that's what this is about. 
 It's not. 
 You've been hanging around with Phillip Kopus? 
 So, is this, like, an official interrogation? 
 You're a rider without a helmet. 
 I stopped you-- yeah, it's official. 
 Now, I'll ask you again. 
 Have you been spending time with Phillip Kopus? 
 No. 
 There was a robbery last week... a nursing home. 
 You hear anything about that? 
 No. 
 You're not much of a liar, kid. 
 I'm not lying. 
 I wanna believe you're not stupid. 
 A guy like that doesn't take you under his wing 'cause he gives a sh1t. 
 He's using you-- you get that, right? 
 So, you care? 
 That's why you pulled me over? 
 I matter? 
 I want you to hear me. 
 If there's ever anything that you wanna get off your chest... 
 What, are you here for me? 
 You're getting in over your head, son. 
 He's not one of the good guys. 
 Wear a helmet. 
 I might not like you. 
 That doesn't mean I wanna be cleaning your brains off the road. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 What was your brother like? 
 You don't talk about him. 
 If you don't want to, it's okay. 
 No, it's okay. 
 Oh... 
 I guess he was like me a little bit... or, I was like him. 
 We always got colds at the same time. 
 I found a bunch of old tapes that he recorded stuff on. 
 Yeah, he didn't trust his own memory. 
 Your voice was on there. 
 It was? 
 He recorded you when you were sleeping, and then, you woke up and got annoyed. 
 Yeah, he was a funny guy. 
 Did you date other guys in high school? 
 Did I date other guys in high school? 
 Sometimes, on the tape, Brian would talk about you and a guy, and I kinda wondered if it was dad. 
 I did see someone else for a little while, but there was only ever your father for me. 
 Was dad friends with Brian? 
 Brian was quirky, and Harold was such a guy-guy. 
 You miss him? 
 Yeah. 
 The thing about being a twin is that you never feel alone, even when you are. 
 I miss that. 
 It was really hard for me to find out you were hanging out with that Lenape boy. 
 It felt like it was happening all over again. 
 What was? 
 My brother was in danger-- I didn't know it. 
 I should have. 
 How? 
 He was hanging around with the wrong people. 
 I'm not seeing Junior, anymore. 
 Okay. 
 Well, he knew about the old folks' home, and he asked me if I knew where you were. 
 What did you tell him? 
 Nothin'. 
 Nothin' nothin'? 
 I told him I didn't know what he was talkin' about. 
 That's not nothin', Junior. 
 Don't worry about that guy-- I'll take care of him. 
 Come on-- help me sort through these. 
 What's all that? 
 Stuff that doesn't get ya high. 
 Here... that's what we're lookin' for. 
 Toss the rest. 
 You sick? 
 I'm just lookin'. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Stopping kids without helmets. 
 You've been busy, huh? 
 Playing at being a cop, all of a sudden? 
 I thought you understood to stay out of my way. 
 You know, you did a number on that security guard last week. 
 I'm impressed, Harold. 
 You broke a couple ribs. 
 I forgot how much you like to hurt people. 
 I don't really care how you like to spend your days. 
 I just wanna remind you that, if anything happens to me or any of my friends, your wife goes to jail. 
 And after what you've been doing comes out, you'll be going away, too. 
 Are your kids ready to fend for themselves? 
 [Microwave beeping] 
 Captain, what's goin' on? 
 DA got a tip about the guys connected with those pharmaceutical robberies. 
 No big surprise-- it's up in the mountains. 
 It's that squatter house at the end of Lupine Road. 
 The squatter house? 
 They needed back-up. 
 I told 'em I'd send all available personnel. 
 I'm on it. 
 Come on! 
 I'm sorry. 
 The person you-- 
 Damn it! 
 Mike, you moron. 
 Kopus! 
 Kopus! 
 Kopus! 
 Hey! 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-- you need to get outta here! 
 The DEA's on its way. 
 sh1t! 
 Someone called in a tip. 
 Get outta my way. 
 Wait-wait-wait-- hit me. 
 Ugh! 
 [Groaning] 
 Show me your hands! 
 Hey-hey-hey! 
 I'm a-- I'm a cop-- I'm a cop. 
 Go, go, go. 
 Guys, circle back, circle back! 
 See-- through there. 
 [Screaming in pain] 
 I got him-- Go, go, go! 
 You go! 
 Hey, it's all right-- all right, hold on. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 [Groaning] 
 I hopped on one of the forest service roads. 
 I thought I could cover the back of the house, in case anyone tried to get out that way. 
 I would've kept my distance, but I left after you, so I just figured you would've gotten here before me. 
 And, when I entered the property over here, I thought I heard someone around the back so I went over to investigate, attempted to apprehend. 
 You know, we got into it, and he struck me. 
 You got a good look at him, though. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 He was, um, my height, dark-skinned, had a shaved head. 
 Age? 
 Twenty, 25, I'd say-- somewhere around there. 
 You said you didn't recognize him. 
 No, I've never seem him before in my life. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Oh, hey, Agent Greenwood. 
 Any word on how your guy's doin'? 
 He'll be working a desk job for a good, long while. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Where you been? 
 Out. 
 That's not an answer, Junior. 
 I don't wanna keep doin' this. 
 What's goin' on with you? 
 What's that? 
 Medicine for cancer. 
 This is your prescription. 
 You didn't fill it-- I looked it up. 
 You need this. 
 Where'd you get this? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Where'd you get it? 
 Who cares where I got it? 
 You need it. 
 This is stolen? 
 Look, you're sick. 
 Why aren't you doin' anything about it? 
 We don't steal. 
 That's not how I raised you. 
 Are you listenin' to me? 
 You're being so stupid. 
 What? 
 You're sick. 
 You need to get better. 
 And this'll help you. 
 Do you get that I wanna help you? 
 Look, I need you to get better, all right? 
 So, just-- just take it, please. 
 Junior. 
 June. 
 Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 [Sighs] 
 I've collected enough data that I think I can make an accurate diagnosis. 
 There's little doubt in my mind that you're suffering from schizophrenia. 
 That you've had symptoms since your first daughter was born. 
 No, no, no. 
 I understand how difficult this is to accept. 
 Since Rachel was born, 16 years ago? 
 Yes. 
 That's impossible. 
 How could she have had it that long, with nobody knowing? 
 Well, her drinking masked the symptoms. 
 She's not crazy. 
 You're not. 
 Harold. 
 I understand that this is hard to hear. 
 What about bipolar? 
 They get confused. I read on the internet that they get confused. 
 We've ruled that out. 
 Well, then, do more tests. 
 She's not schizophrenic-- she's normal. 
 Mr. Jensen, schizophrenics can live normal lives. 
 We're gonna get a second opinion. 
 You're welcome to do that. 
 We don't need a second opinion. 
 I can think better. 
 It's quieter. 
 The pills are working. 
 These are the pills you give to people who have schizophrenia? 
 You don't have that. 
 You don't have that. 
 She's just stressed out, okay? 
 She needs to come home, soon. 
 Well, she can go home tonight, if she wants to. 
 Tonight? 
 If you feel up to it. 
 You just have to be vigilant about taking your medication. 
 I can go over the schedule with both of you before you leave. 
 
 
 
 Junior? 
 June? 
 Hey, June? 
 Hi. 
 Jesus. 
 You scared me-- What are you doin' here? 
 I needed to take a shower-- do you mind? 
 You can't just come in my house when you want to. 
 Used to be my house, too, remember? 
 That was a long time ago. 
 Don't worry-- I'll be out in a second. 
 What are those? 
 Where did Junior get those? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't believe you. 
 He's a good kid, Phillip-- he stands a chance. 
 He doesn't have to turn into you. 
 I guess I lacked a role model. 
 You know what? 
 I wanna know somethin'. 
 How come you never showed up? 
 You never came and saw me once. 
 I didn't know where you were. 
 I asked Jack-- he said he didn't know. 
 When I finally found out it was prison, I was too mad to come. 
 That's probably for the best. 
 I'm good. 
 I don't believe you. 
 I'm here. 
 Are you here to stay? 
 Yeah, I am. 
 You mad about that, too? 
 Are you sick? 
 That's none of your business. 
 I don't want your stolen pills. 
 You're such a martyr. 
 I didn't get those. 
 Take 'em, don't take 'em-- I don't care. 
 How do we know for sure it's mom's brother? 
 I found this stuff in their house, in mom's old closet. 
 Who else would it be? 
 He talked about grandpa and grandma. 
 He talks about his twin sister. 
 It's him. 
 What does he sound like? 
 Lonely. 
 And he talks about dad. 
 About dad? 
 What does he say? 
 I think dad teased him or something. 
 He says, "Harold doesn't talk to me, anymore." 
 Well, that doesn't mean dad teased him or anything, right? 
 He ignored him. 
 That's worse. 
 Did you play these for Junior? 
 I told you, we broke up. 
 [Door closing] Dad's home. 
 Hi, guys. 
 Mom! 
 Hey, mom. 
 Hi. 
 How are you? 
 I'm okay. 
 I'm home now, so everything's gonna be okay. 
 [Collective chatter, music blaring] 
 Man, put that away-- Jesus. 
 I thought college girls were supposed to be smart. 
 The one with the shaved head gave me this for two pills. 
 Those are real diamonds, right? 
 Maybe. 
 How much you sell? 
 About half of mine. 
 How about you? 
 All of it. 
 Kopus will be happy. 
 He'll probably ask you to step up a bit. 
 You ready for that? 
 I guess, yeah. 
 Hope so. 
 You ever carry a gun? 
 Better wrap your head around that. 
 Right. 
 I'm serious. 
 It's part of the job. 
 What are you talkin' about? 
 I'm just sayin', if you wanna be involved, you need to be prepared. 
 Whatever Kopus says, you gotta do it. 
 No questions asked. 
 Just wanna make sure you're down with that. 
 I'm not gonna shoot anybody. 
 You messin' with me? 
 Who do you think did that NYU kid? 
 [Knock at door] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hello? 
 Are you Deputy Jensen? 
 Harold? 
 Yeah, what's goin' on? 
 I'm Detective Alcala-- this is Detective Patten. 
 We're, uh, from NYPD, workin' on the Dennis Bradley case. 
 Can we talk to you for a few minutes? 
 Yeah, all right-- come on in. 
 We're sorry to bother you so late. 
 This Dennis Bradley case has been a bitch right from the start. 
 But we had a development, and, uh, we need to ask you a few questions. 
 Right-- so, you want somethin' to drink? 
 No, thank you. 
 So, what's goin' on? 
 A friend of Dennis Bradley's told us that Dennis used to come out here to score meth from a guy named Mike. 
 Does that name ring a bell to you? 
 Who, Mike? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah, I know a lot of Mikes. 
 Do you know a lot of Mike Parkers? 
 Do I have it right that you picked up a guy named Mike Parker last week for smokin' pot? 
 Mike Park-- Yeah, yeah. 
 No, I pulled him over. 
 Did you book him? 
 What, for havin' a roach in his ashtray? 
 No, I let him off with a warning. 
 You let a lot of people off with warnings? 
 You see, it turns out that this Mike Parker has been busted a couple of times for possession with intent. 
 Did you-- did you run him before you cut him loose? 
 Yeah, yeah-- I still thought it was a waste of time. 
 Jesus. 
 You see, the thing is, Harold, if you had busted him, like you were supposed to, we'd at least have an address to work with here. 
 That's why my partner is a little out of sorts. 
 But you let him go, a guy with priors. 
 You see, I don't quite understand that. 
 I mean, is that, uh, some kinda small-town logic, or are you just tired of doing your job? 
 Okay, what is this? 
 Are you guys looking for a scapegoat? 
 Huh? 
 You wanna talk to me, you come to the station. 
 Otherwise, I'm goin' back to bed. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Fine. 
 Do appreciate your time. 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry I couldn't be more help. 
 You had a lot of pills in that stash, you know. 
 Yeah, I got somethin' in the works. 
 For what? 
 I'll tell you when it's time. 
 You need me to go to another dorm this weekend? 
 Nah. 
 If it's another pharmacy or whatever, I can help out. 
 Not this time. 
 Is this 'cause of what I said to Mike? 
 What? 
 About not wanting to kill anybody? 
 Why would you think you had to kill somebody? 
 Well, Mike said-- he-- he told me about the NYU guy. 
 Told you what about him? 
 That he, uh-- you know. 
 No, I don't know. 
 Explain it to me, and don't leave anything out. 
 Mike said that he killed him. 
 I'm-- I'm not up for that, but I can do other stuff. 
 What else did Mike say? 
 That was it. 
 And where were you when he was runnin' his mouth? 
 At the dorms. 
 Mike's an idiot. He wants people to think he's tough, so he says stupid sh1t. 
 Keep that in mind. 
 Now, why don't you head back? 
 Okay. 
 Junior. 
 Don't talk about this with anyone. 
 [Collective chatter] 
 You know, we gotta carry all this crap back to the city, eventually. 
 You think maybe you could organize it in some manner, so we know what the hell we're lookin' at? 
 Jesus-- what a couple of assholes. 
 Hey, uh, listen... uh, first day we started searchin', something came in. 
 It was, uh, it was somethin' that belonged to my wife's twin brother, who passed away. 
 The Captain said I could take it. 
 Give it to his parents. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 No, it was a long time ago. 
 No, I mean, I'm sorry. 
 Those detectives haven't released any of this. 
 I can't purge anything until they sign off. 
 Right. 
 So, there's no delivery on our end. 
 I just pick it up, pay us, and we're done. 
 That's way more money than I thought we were gettin'. 
 I don't wanna see you spendin' it right after. 
 I know-- probably save it, anyway. 
 Yeah, for what? 
 I don't know-- a house or somethin'. 
 Another round? 
 Yeah, keep 'em comin', hun? 
 A house, huh? 
 You mean, meth? 
 Me and my girl wanna get our own place. 
 We're gonna have a kid soon. 
 It's supposed to be born on Christmas. 
 Indian Jesus. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I didn't want you to think I was distracted. 
 I love this lobster, man. 
 When we get through with this haul, I'm gonna eat one every day for a month. 
 You know, I always knew, long as I followed you, good things would come. 
 You're like those guys from the war movies. 
 You know, the ones that are never gonna die. 
 I'm gonna die, Mikey. 
 Yeah, but you're gonna die last. 
 Never seen you drinkin' before. 
 You worried about the buy? 
 I just like to flush my mind out every once in a while. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 Good things ahead. 
 I gotta take a leak. 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 What the hell is that? 
 I know what's goin' on. 
 I know what we're doin' out here. 
 I don't know what you're doin' out here. 
 I'm pissin'. 
 Jesus-- you're drunk. 
 Yeah, so are you. 
 Think it'd make it easier that way? 
 Mike. 
 Been your friend since we were kids. 
 Everybody else in this town cut you off a long time ago, but I've always had your back. 
 Put the gun down. 
 Even your dad. 
 What? 
 Your dad had you set up down in Florida. 
 Yeah, he's the one who got you busted. 
 He bragged about it. 
 He said, "That's how you take care of a problem." 
 But when you came back, I was loyal. 
 I stood by, you know? 
 You should trust me, man. 
 That's the same gun you used to kill Dennis Bradley, isn't it? 
 Isn't it? 
 I told you to get rid of that. 
 Let me have it. 
 No. 
 Mike, give me the gun. 
 If you're so worried, then take the bullets out. 
 Give me the gun. 
 I'm your friend. 
 Relax. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 [Gasps] 
 I'm sorry, Mike. 
 [Groans] 
 ♪ 
 We start out the way we're supposed to be. 
 Then, our parents make us into something else. 
 We try and try to change ourselves back, but we can't, 'cause we're like a tape you can only record on once. 
 I wish me and my sister didn't have parents... so we could grow up pure. 
 I'm gonna record the same thing on both sides of this tape, so-- so it's like a strange loop. 
 'Cause that's what everything is... it's just a strange loop. 
 It all goes in the same circle, over and over. 
 It just keeps getting faster. 
 That's why I like running track. 
 'Cause if you run against the loop, it slows things down. 
 [Groans] 
 Some people are on side A, and other people are on side B. 
 Sometimes, when side A gets quiet, you can hear side B whispering underneath. 
 They can both get erased just as easy.
