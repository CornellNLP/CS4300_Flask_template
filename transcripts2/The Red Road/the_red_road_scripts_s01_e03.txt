 Dad? 
 Dad! 
 Hey, Katie. 
 [Panting] 
 What are you doing? 
 I don't know. 
 When is mom coming home? 
 Soon. 
 You know, mom usually wakes up Rachel. 
 She won't get up unless somebody makes her. 
 Well, maybe today, that somebody can be you. 
 Like she'll listen to me. 
 Katie... 
 I'm just asking for some help here, okay? 
 Go get ready for school. 
 [Collective chatter] 
 The driver left the scene. 
 Left this child there to die! 
 Hey, Harold. 
 Captain. 
 It's been nine days! 
 Catch this sh1t show out there? 
 Nine days since the accident and no arrests have been made. 
 So, here's the question-- do the police value the lives of our children? 
 [All] No! 
 Chief Mac is going to town with this. 
 How's Jean? 
 She's, um, you know, we thought she'd recover better in a hospital. 
 So, that's where she is. 
 Well, did she say anything more about the night of the accident? 
 No. 
 Hmm... steer clear of the protesters. 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 We no longer will tolerate the legacy of disenfranchisement! 
 [Collective shouting] 
 How do you know you're not gonna get caught? 
 'Cause Kopus is smart. 
 Mmm. 
 Robbing an old folks' home is smart how? 
 It's not that big a deal-- it's insured. 
 Nobody got hurt. 
 Were you scared? 
 A little, at first. 
 Then it's like, I got super focused. 
 Should've taken the SATs right after. 
 Oh, my God. 
 If my dad ever found out-- 
 He won't. 
 I'm so glad you're back in school. 
 Me, too. 
 What? 
 This is wrong. 
 It isn't working. 
 I don't feel like myself-- nothing's working! 
 Well, that's the anti-psychotics. 
 Why are you givin' her pills that don't make her feel better? 
 They will-- we just have to find the right dosage. 
 Well, how long is that gonna take? 
 Well, brain chemistry is a tricky thing. 
 [Indistinct] _ 
 Why can't you just put her on something that's worked for other people? 
 I don't understand-- she's saying-she's saying she's worse than when she came here. 
 But it's a process to find the right dosage. 
 I mean, she's sitting here like a guinea pig. 
 I mean, can't you just give her something you know is gonna make her feel good, at least? 
 Well, this-this drug we know will work, but it's a process. 
 And, in the meantime, she gets to feel like sh1t. 
 This is a process-- give it time. 
 I wish you were dead. 
 Jean? 
 Jean? 
 Sorry. 
 What did you just say? 
 It's a process, but we'll get there. 
 I promise. 
 Okay, guys, I need you to focus here. 
 So, we know he was wearing a light blue jacket. 
 Spector, I need you to hit this area, again. 
 Already checked it. 
 Yeah, well, you blew through it too fast, okay? 
 This is only a quarter mile from the point he was last seen. 
 If we can find something he might've dropped, get an LKP, this is a whole new ball game, all right?

 I need a gun to make the money. 
 Hey, guess what I found out last night? 
 My girl's pregnant. 
 And I'm gonna do it right this time-- I am. 
 I'm gonna raise that baby right. 
 I never told you this, but your, you know, your mother, Marie, she wanted to have you aborted, but I said, "No, Marie-- come on, honey, baby. 
 Maybe you'll have a beautiful baby girl." 
 But, uh... then she had you. 
 Come back with some money, I'll give ya a gun, okay? 
 Where ya goin'?

 Screw you. 
 Awesome-- grandma and grandpa's house. 
 You're sending us to prison. 
 Well, good-- I'm glad you see it that way. 
 I'm sorry about this, honey. 
 Why do we have to stay here? 
 'Cause your grandparents can keep a better eye on you than I can right now. 
 Look, I have to go to work. 
 You girls can't just be home alone. 
 Why can't you just take the day off? 
 Because I can't. 
 I mean, you can't just take days off. 
 This isn't what I want to do, okay? 
 It's what I have to do. 
 I'm just trying to keep this family afloat. 
 I'm not worth anything, if I can't do that.

 Sky Van Der Veen. 
 Phillip Kopus. 
 Yeah, I know who you are. 
 Do you mind if I sit down? 
 Wow. 
 You're a lawyer. 
 I thought lawyers were supposed to argue all the time. 
 You were the quiet one-- you never said anything at all. 
 You don't remember me. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Big eyes, big ears. 
 You were shy. 
 Your dad died when you were real little. 
 I remember that. 
 Yeah. 
 You know how I know you? 
 No. 
 I was seven. 
 I used to stare out my window... watching the high school kids wait for the bus. 
 All the boys would shove each other, showin' off, but not you. 
 Even if someone tried to start something with you, you'd just watch. 
 The old bus stop off Route 27? 
 Mmm-hmm-- lived in the green house. 
 You live there now? 
 Brooklyn. 
 City mouse?

 Uh, "that." 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Yeah-- Um, can you excuse me? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Sorry. 
 Uh, don't be pissed, but that guy wants a bigger cut. 
 Which guy? 
 The guy that tipped us off. 
 Says he wants more pills, or he's gonna call the cops. 
 I guess he's got a cousin on the force, in Riley. 
 Tell him no. 
 Takin' off? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Uh, my gram lives up Deer Hill Road. 
 She falls asleep every night on the couch, watching reruns on TV. 
 Wanna come up tomorrow? 
 Cook us dinner. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 We'll catch up. 
 Somethin' like that-- yeah. 
 So, why do you say that your medications aren't working? 
 Because I feel like sh1t. 
 You know, it's-it's not uncommon for people to self-medicate with alcohol, in order to disguise their symptoms. 
 I don't understand-- what does that mean? 
 Jean? 
 Hmm? 
 How long have you been hearing voices? 
 It's been months? 
 Years? 
 You can talk to me. 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you afraid, if you admit you hear them, then they'll have more power? 
 No. 
 Well, the sooner you talk to me, the sooner you can go home. 
 When did it start? 
 [Sighs] 
 It wasn't like it is now. 
 It was just a fuzziness, just a random thought. 
 It didn't feel like it came from me. 
 It felt like... someone else put it in my head, and I don't know-- 
 I just assumed it was... part of being pregnant. 
 Pregnant? 
 With our first-- with Rachel.
