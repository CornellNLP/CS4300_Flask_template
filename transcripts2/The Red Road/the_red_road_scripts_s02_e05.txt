 (Narrator) Previously on The Red Road... 
 Harold Jensen : Captain said they pumped paint sludge into the iron mines. 
 I never heard anything like that. 
 Jack Kopus : You put enough poison in a mountain eventually, its going to slide down, into the valley. 
 I'm starting a different therapy. 
 I'm really trying to understand what the voices want. 
 [Low ominous voices] 
 You can't let them build casinos here! 
 You don't know the whole story. 
 Phillip Kopus : I found that money next to Mac's body, your father is trying to bribe him. 
 He's the reason Mac is dead. 
 Chief Levi Gall : That one still even shoot? 
 Yeah... it still shoots.

 [ Ticking continues ] 
 I'm-- I'm fine. I'm not hurt. 
 Good. Uh, look, I should have brought this over sooner. 
 Got delivered to our house by mistake. 
 My daughter opened it. [ Chuckles ] Sorry. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Oh, I think it's for your father.

 Thank you.

 I want you and the girls to only drink bottled water, and maybe don't shower right now. 
 What are you talking about? What's wrong with the water? 
 A long time ago, somebody dumped toxic paint sludge into the old mine shafts in the mountain, and it's gotten into Walpole's water supply. 
 I think it's why Dorothy got sick. 
 How long has the water been-- 
 I don't know. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I think your father might have known about this, and I think he might have even had something to do with the dumping. 
 He could have been trying to keep the owners of the auto plant happy. 
 Half the town used to work there. 
 He was probably desperate to keep it open. 
 Are you talking about the stuff you tracked across our carpet the other night? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? Do you remember your father talking about it? 
 No, he never talked about it. 
 I recognized the way it smelled. 
 It reminded me of something. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 It's silly. It wasn't real. 
 When I was a girl, I imagined a man my father worked with came to our door, and he gave me a box to give to my father. 
 And it had that same smell. 
 What was in the box? 
 A bird's nest. 
 The sticks all had paint on them. 
 And the baby birds were all dead, and there was one egg that hadn't hatched yet, and it was... all black. 
 So I left the box on my father's desk, and I... 
 I hid the black egg in my room. 
 And later on, when I asked my father about it, he said... there wasn't any box. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 But the black egg was still in my drawer. 
 And then, a few weeks later, that was gone, too. 
 Do you think that was... real? 
 We have an emergency situation. Nobody drink the water. 
 The reservoir's been poisoned with lead. 
 We need to get the word out. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 The old mines are filled with paint sludge. 
 Okay? It's leeching into our water supply. 
 I'm gonna call the Mayor and  The Record. 
 We're activating all shifts, may need to go door-to-door. 
 Call the schools, all right? 
 Make sure the kids don't drink any city water. 
 And somebody call the Road-Maintenance Department. 
 Help them put up signs all over town. 
 And, Aschell, I need you to coordinate with the Mayor's office, see what the state or the feds can do to get potable emergency water in here. 
 Let's go! 
 Captain, Captain. 
 I got kids. How much lead are we talking about? 
 I don't know. I mean, I took samples to the lab. 
 Waiting on the results. 
 The water hasn't been tested yet? What if you're wrong? 
 Well, then I'll take the heat for it. 
 We got to do something. I got kids, too. 
 I'd rather look stupid than take chances. 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 You here to help put up signs? 
 Junior went to Connecticut with his father. 
 He knows about Mac. 
 How the hell did he find out? 
 I was trying to stop him from going. 
 That worked out well, didn't it? 
 I need you to go get him. 
 I don't know if you can tell or not-- 
 I'm a little busy right now. 
 Yeah, well, I can't leave the state. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 I think he's gonna do something. 
 He was pretty revved up when he left. 
 What do you mean, "Do something"? 
 I think he might try and kill his old man. 
 [ Scoffs ] Junior? Junior's not gonna kill anybody. 
 Yeah, I used to think that, but now I'm not so sure. 
 Well, why don't you call the Tribal Police? 
 Levi's their Chief. You can't trust them. 
 You made this kid into a mad dog. 
 And now he's on the loose, you want to try to pass the buck. 
 I can't fix this for you. 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Children playing in distance ] 
 [ TV chatter ] 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 [ Click ] 
 Hello? 
 Hey. It's me. What are you doing? 
 Can you come over? I want to talk to you. 
 No, I can't. I'm too far away. 
 What's going on? Where are you? 
 Connecticut. 
 Why are you in Connecticut? 
 There's just something I have to do. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Just say you love me? 
 No, wait, what are you talking about? 
 I know what I'm doing. 
 I do. 
 I'm not confused, and if anybody says that to you, just don't believe them, okay? 
 Junior, you're scaring me. 
 Please just come home, okay? 
 I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you. 
 Don't hate me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Beep ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Both giggling ] 
 Woman : Girls, come downstairs. 
 Leave your brother alone. 
 Make sure you double-check those numbers, okay, before we publish. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 This is just unbelievable. 
 Harold, I owe you an apology for not believing you last night. 
 Not now, David, okay? 
 From what I've been able to find out, the mob paid the Lenape to dump that stuff up there. 
 The Lenape are the ones that put it in the mines. 
 You are so full of sh1t. 
 You're just trying to cover your own ass. 
 Y-y-you think  I  knew about this? 
 Oh, I know when I'm being lied to, David. 
 You worked in the Mayor's office. 
 There's no way you didn't know about this. 
 Bill knew, and he was supposedly your friend. 
 Is that why he was so afraid to talk about it? 
 You putting pressure on him to keep quiet? 
 You want to make accusations, you'd better have something to back it up. 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Rachel : - Dad? 
 Honey, I'm busy right now. 
 [ Voice breaking ] I'm-- I'm afraid Junior's gonna do something. 
 [ Crying ] He called me from Connecticut, and... 
 I think he's gonna try and kill himself. 
 Please help. Please help me. 
 I don't know what to do. Dad? 
 Uh, why don't you take a break? 
 Sure. 
 See, I know you're not interested in museums, but I thought you might like this. 
 We dug these up less than half a mile from my house. 
 They tell me it's a real treasure trove. 
 Ironically, the reason we found them was because we were digging a foundation for a new wing of our resort. 
 And you're still gonna build there? 
 We only have so much land. 
 To not use every inch of it would be wasteful. 
 When you're Chief, your responsibility's to the people, not the land. 
 You talk a lot. 
 Hazard of the profession. 
 If you dig up the mountain where the Lenape are, you wouldn't find any of this. 
 They have no real Indian ancestry. 
 Yes, they do. 
 They're mixed, a little bit of everything. 
 But they still prefer to call themselves Indians. 
 Because that's what they are. 
 No, son. 
 That's the name that benefits them the most. 
 And I don't blame them for it. 
 But the reality is, you don't get to choose what you are. 
 It's in your blood. 
 Kate : Mom, please. They're obviously not home. 
 I know. 
 Why did you have to drag  me  here? 
 You know I have enough to worry about with Junior. 
 I can't handle you freaking out right now. 
 I'm not freaking out. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Mom, let's go home. 
 Mom, you're making a mess! 
 Did you take your meds today? 
 You thought you were getting better. 
 It made you sick, just like my brother. 
 What are you talking about? I'm gonna call dad. 
 Just take your pills, mom. 
 Damn it. Why won't that open? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 This is your fault. 
 You took those pills to get attention, and you just made it worse. 
 Shut up, Katie! 
 Mom? 
 What? 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 What is it? 
 [ Scoffs, sighs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Your mother's an idiot. 
 I guess grandpa's been reading up on me. 
 I thought I had it all figured out. 
 What do you mean? 
 You don't know, do you? 
 You know why? 'Cause you're not sick. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It makes you think you know things, important things no one else can see. 
 [ Pipes clanging softly ] 
 What's wrong? 
 [ Furnace whirs ] 
 [ Knocking on wall ] 
 [ Hollow knocking ] 
 Mom! 
 Mom! Mom, stop! 
 Stop it! 
 [ Metal clangs ] 
 [ Gasping ] 
 Do you s-- do you see that, too? 
 It's real? 
 Yeah. 
 [ Air rushes ] 
 [ Rock music plays ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Can I have another one? 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 Keep the change. Just make sure you keep 'em coming. 
 Mmm. 
 You all right? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hey, this is a nice tip, but still gonna have to cut you off soon. 
 Saw the thing on your ankle. 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 That... is all for you. 
 You just got to make sure I drink until I pass out. 
 Trying to put myself to sleep, keep myself out of trouble. 
 You understand? 
 I only got three days left on my parole. 
 What kind of trouble you trying to keep yourself out of? 
 The kind that comes when you help people. 
 Sometimes it's best to let people help themselves. 
 That's the spirit. 
 Let's switch to something stronger, shall we? 
 Now, this came from a museum that's since been closed. 
 I used to go there as a boy. 
 I was always so afraid of this damn thing. 
 It gave me nightmares. 
 But I still loved looking at it. 
 Mac once told me you'd never step foot on my Reservation. 
 I've changed my mind. 
 What changed it? 
 You did. 
 Huh. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 Stop! 
 [ All grunting ] 
 They brainwashed you, kid. 
 Man : Call an ambulance! 
 Don't take him to the Detention Center. 
 Take him to the cabin. 
 Get! 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Sighs ] Ohh. 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Doorbell rings ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Can I help you? 
 Is this the Chief's residence? 
 You a cop? 
 Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm Captain of the Walpole Police Department. 
 The what police department? 
 Walpole. 
 It's a town in New Jersey. 
 You know you're not in New Jersey, right? 
 This is Tribal land. You don't have jurisdiction here. 
 Yeah, I-I understand that. Yeah, I'm here as a civilian. 
 I'm a friend of Marie Van Der Veen, Junior's guardian. 
 Look, I was hoping I could speak with him. 
 It's an urgent family matter. 
 He went back to Jersey. 
 Already? He just got here this morning. 
 [ Door thuds ] 
 Yeah, I'm not leaving here until I talk to the Chief. 
 He's not here. 
 Then I'll wait. 
 Please move your foot or I'm gonna break it. 
 Thanks! Thank you! 
 Been very helpful! 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hello. Can you hear me? 
 Rachel : I can hear you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Kate : - Mom? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Are you okay? 
 It's all real. 
 Sylvia : Look at this mess. 
 David : What the hell is she doing in here? 
 Jean! David, look. 
 She's out of control. 
 [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 Jean, put that down. 
 Girls, why don't you come downstairs with me? 
 [ Distorted ] You should stab me, Jeanie, but you won't. 
 You won't do anything but listen. 
 [ Distorted ] I can't control what your father does, Jeanie, any more than you can control your brother. 
 I can either fix him or send him away to one of those institutions. 
 You don't want me to send him away, do you? 
 He does the best that he can. 
 [ Distortion fading ] But it's not easy raising children. 
 They're you. 
 [ Breathes shakily ] 
 They're you. 
 Oh. Come on. We got to go, girls. 
 Come on! Let's go! 
 You girls go downstairs. I want to talk to your mother. 
 Jean : No! We're leaving! 
 Come on. 
 Jean! 
 Man :  44, one thousand, 45, one thousand, 46, one thousand, 47, one thousand, 48, one thousand, 49, one thousand, 50. 
 
 
 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 Sir, you've been asked to leave the area. 
 Yeah, I need to talk to the Chief first. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 Don't be so sure. 
 Step out of the car, sir. 
 Excuse me? 
 Step out of the car, sir. You're under arrest. 
 Good one. 
 Please hand over your firearm. 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 If you offer any resistance, my partner's going to shoot you. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 You guys are making a big mistake. 
 You're trespassing on private property. 
 You've got no jurisdiction here. 
 Why don't you give me my gun back and I'll just head on home? 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 Come on. Get out. 
 What are we doing here? 
 Move. 
 This is the Captain's wife again. 
 No, I did, but he's not answering his phone. 
 So why can't someone help me find him? 
 What do you mean, you don't know where he is? 
 Well, I realize that, but can't you find him? 
 You're the police! 
 Well, that's not good enough, and I-- 
 No,  you  calm down! You calm down! 
 I'm the Captain's wife! Why isn't anybody helping me?! 
 [ Beep ] 
 It's all right. Everything's fine. 
 Everything's fine. 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 I've got to piss. 
 Go for it. 
 How much longer is it gonna be? 
 Just until your father gets here. 
 Well, can I wait outside? 
 You know, there's no point in asking me for things. 
 I don't make decisions. 
 What's gonna happen to me? 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 [ Vehicle approaches ] 
 Is it him? 
 [ Radio chatter ] 
 [ Lock turns ] 
 [ Door rattles ] 
 [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 He still alive? 
 Yeah, he is. 
 Cody : I didn't-- I didn't mean to do any... 
 Go park it behind the shed, then come on this side. 
 Come on. Let me-- 
 Go. 
 All right. 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Car door closes ] 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 [ Wind chimes ringing ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Jean : - Hello? 
 Phillip? 
 Wake up. 
 Wake up, Phil. Wake up. 
 Wake up. Wake up! 
 What the hell? 
 Harold's-- Harold's not answering his phone. 
 He went to get Junior, and now he's not answering his phone. 
 So I called the station, and no one's helping me, so get up. 
 Ohh. What do you mean? He said he wasn't going. 
 Well, he did, and now I need you to go find him. 
 Please, come on. Just go. 
 I can't. 
 He's in Connecticut. I can't leave the state. 
 What? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't go back to prison. 
 [ Sighs ] Your husband's the hero, not me. 
 Oh, you care about people. I know you, Phillip. 
 I know you. 
 No, you don't. 
 I know you. I know you. I know you care about people. 
 No, you don't! 
 I've killed people. You understand? 
 You don't know me. 
 You know what else? 
 I blackmailed Harold after you hit that kid. 
 I don't care. 
 I know you're sorry. 
 I'm not. I used you, and I'd do it again. 
 There's no one else to go to. Please help me. 
 Get out of my house. 
 I'm not leaving. Please. 
 Get out of my house. 
 You're a good person. 
 You have to help. - The only reason that you think that I'm a good person-- look at me-- is because you are crazy. 
 That is it. That is the only reason. 
 That's not the only reason. 
 Get out. 
 That's not the only reason! 
 Get out. 
 [ Door slams ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [  Woman screams  ]

 Man :  The Tempter came to him and said...

 [ TV chatter continues ]

 [ Window rattling ] 
 [ Glass shatters ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Cody : [ Muffled ] Hello? 
 I-I'm-- I'm bleeding bad! Please! Let me go! 
 I-I won't tell anybody. 
 Why are you in there? What did you do? 
 I'm bleeding, and I'm running out of air, man! 
 T-they're gonna kill me! 
 Answer the question. 
 Jesus. The Chief, okay? I'm in here 'cause of the Chief. 
 I messed up a job, all right? 
 Shut up, man. All right? Shut up. 
 I'm gonna let you out. 
 I can't breathe! I'm dying! Hurry up! 
 Shh! Shut up! 
 [ Gasps ] 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 Oh, come on. 
 [ Both grunt ] 
 Tell me you got a car or something, man. 
 No. You know these woods at all? 
 All right. Come on. Let's go. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 I don't understand. I told you to watch him. 
 Hey, Chief! 
 Can I talk to you for a second? 
 Remember me? I'm looking for my little brother. 
 You were gonna pay me to move my house. Remember? 
 I imagine with all that sludge in the mines, building a casino out there might be a bit of a problem. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Did you hurt yourself? 
 I want you off my Reservation. 
 This is the one and only warning I'm going to afford you. 
 Make sure he doesn't get lost on his way out. 
 Where's your car? 
 You mess with me, I'll break your arm. 
 Yeah, it's a truck. It's right over here. 
 Harold : I'm gonna lodge a formal complaint against you assholes. 
 You don't keep a police captain in a holding cell. 
 We're still in America. 
 Phillip : - No, you're not. 
 The hell are you doing here? What about your parole? 
 I broke it. 
 Well, if you were gonna do that, why in the hell did you ask me to come up here? 
 I just spent the last 10 hours in a drunk tank. 
 They confiscated my gun, my phone. 
 'Cause getting Junior's gonna be a two-man job. 
 You can't go. 
 Look. For all we know, he's back at home. 
 I just called my mom to check. Nobody there has seen him. 
 I think he's still here. 
 Why would Levi risk locking you up unless he was scared you were gonna find something? 
 I think Junior already made his move. 
 Levi's hand was bandaged. 
 Okay. Let's suppose he did do something. 
 We have no idea where to look for him. 
 I do. 
 How? 
 Don't worry about it. We'll take my truck. 
 Yours is gonna attract too much attention. 
 [ Truck door opens ] 
 All right. Give me your phone. 
 [ Beep ] 
 [ Truck door closes ] 
 [ Dialing ] 
 Jean : Hello? 
 Hey, I'm sorry I didn't call. Trying to track down Junior. 
 He's got himself in a little trouble with the authorities up here. Everything okay? 
 Yes. Everything's fine. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. Do what you need to do for Junior. 
 Everything's fine here. 
 Okay, well, good. I'll be back as soon as I can. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 [ Click ] 
 All right. Where are we going? 
 [ Thudding ] 
 What the hell have you goin' there? 
 I told you to be quiet. 
 Now I'm an accomplice to that! 
 You just made me an accomplice to kidnapping! 
 Does that look like a kid? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Grunts, coughs ] 
 I want you to know I had nothing to do with this. 
 Then untie me, asshole. 
 We're going to. 
 Just as soon as we find Junior. 
 I can't feel my arms. 
 Hey, don't worry. I see them. They're still there. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 So, you gonna untie me? 
 Or are you waiting for your boyfriend to say it's okay? 
 You know, we're outside my jurisdiction. 
 You're gonna have to wait for Tribal Police to come and untie you. 
 I don't want to step on anybody's toes. 
 You're both gonna die. 
 Oh, yeah. Hey, hey, hey. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Muffled grunting ] 
 Let's go. 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 Here. 
 You're a better shot anyways. 
 You know, I was about to say the same thing. 
 [ Grunting continues ] 
 That's a lot of blood. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Phillip : There's a trail. 
 I don't see this ending well. 
 You should probably head on back. 
 I don't want to be responsible for making Jean a widow. 
 Well, I'm not gonna go home and tell Rachel I left her boyfriend to die in the woods? 
 He's not gonna die. 
 Cody : [ Groaning ] 
 They still back there? 
 Junior : No. I think we're good. 
 How far to the Reservation line? 
 It's a couple miles southwest. 
 Well, we're gonna make it. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 You might make it. 
 I won't. 
 No. 
 [ Groans ] 
 I'm gonna get you there. 
 This is gonna hurt, probably. 
 [ Groans ] 
 Sorry. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 You got to take it off every 15, okay? 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Both breathing heavily ] 
 So, what did you do? 
 I tried to kill the Chief. 
 No sh1t? Wish you had. 
 Me too. 
 He's my father. 
 That's pretty messed up, trying to kill your father. 
 What about you? 
 How did you end up in the trunk? 
 Me and my uncle, we screwed up a job. 
 We were supposed to deliver some money to another tribe. 
 It was a payoff. 
 Where's your uncle? 
 Dead. 
 Some cop shot him in the back. 
 It's better than what I'm gonna get if Levi ever catches me. 
 I tried to tell my uncle that we should have just gone back after it happened, beg Levi for mercy, but he-- he said Levi would kill us. 
 And we hid out down there a couple of days, tried to steal the money back so we could run off somewhere. 
 Who were you supposed to give the money to? 
 The Lenape Chief. 
 Levi was trying to convince him to sign up with him, build a casino. 
 So, we were down there to give him the money. 
 He said-- said something about getting his glasses so he could count it. 
 Then he went back into his house, and I-- I saw these fireworks going off over the trees. 
 I was watching them. 
 Then I heard this shot go off behind me. 
 And I turned around and saw my uncle on my ground. 
 The Chief was standing there with a rifle. 
 And... I shot him. 
 I look over, and I see my uncle getting up. 
 He doesn't have a scratch on him. 
 And I guess the Chief was just firing a warning shot and my uncle tripped. 
 And then somebody else was rolling up on the house. 
 So, we booked it out of there, left the money. 
 The whole thing was a total mess. 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 [ Sniffs, grunts ] 
 What's the matter? 
 What's wrong? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Indistinct shouting in distance ] 
 Hey. Come on. Help me up. 
 They're coming. 
 I knew that Chief that you killed. 
 And I loved him. 
 And I promised myself that whoever murdered him would pay for it. 
 [ Breathes shakily ] 
 Here. Take it. 
 Give you a fighting chance. 
 No, no, no, no, no. Wait. I didn't mean to kill him! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! It was an accident! It was an-- 
 Don't. Don't le-- Don't leave me here. 
 They're gonna kill me! 
 Please! 
 [ Grunts ] 
 You hurt? 
 Yeah. Girl shot me. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. I imagine 'cause she wanted me to die. 
 And why's that? 
 I might have misled her about some things. 
 Well, listen. If we meet any resistance, nobody can die. 
 All right? You plan on killing people, I'm heading back right now. 
 Nobody's gonna die. Unless they start-- 
 No "Unless." Just tell me nobody's gonna die and put a goddamn period at the end of it! 
 It's up to them, not us. 
 I just lost the blood trail. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 H-he ran off up there. 
 [ Gasps ]
