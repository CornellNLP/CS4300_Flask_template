 Previously on The Red Road... 
 I know you're the reason I got sent up. 
 We're done. Last thing I ever give ya. 
 They found the college kid's body. 
 Someone shot him... dumped him in the lake. 
 Look, if you just sign it, it'll all be over. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 Harold told me nothing happened. 
 You're a liar. 
 You're dirty! You're a dirty cop! 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Open this door! 
 [Gunshots] 
 Get on your knees. 
 You do understand we're not very nice people, huh? 
 Lie to me, Harold... 
 Tell me I imagined the whole thing. 
 Where's your sister? 
 Jean! 
 You said Kopus brought Jean here. 
 Well, I guess they left. 
 Well, you're her twin, Brian. 
 I thought you guys knew everything about each other. 
 She's with him... I know it. 
 How long have you known that she was banging him? 
 And why didn't you tell me? 
 When would I tell you? 
 You pretend you don't know me when my sister's not around. 
 Dude, can I have one of those? 
 [Distant train whistle] 
 What is wrong with you? 
 My head hurts, all right? 
 Before you showed up at my house, I... took some acid. 
 Dude... dude, Kopus sold it to you, huh? 
 No, Kopus did not sell it to me. 
 He gave it to me. 
 What are you doing with that, man? 
 Are you recording me? 
 What... no. 
 Turn that off. 
 Hey, you think the water's cold? 
 Harold? 
 Harold, do you hear me? 
 This message is for Jean. 
 Anyone else listening is an asshole. 
 You should go screw yourself. 
 So, uh, so, Jeannie, this is something that has to happen, you know? 
 I'm not... I'm not sad about it. 
 I just, uh... 
 I wanna be somewhere else. 
 I wanna be gone and not have to think anymore. 
 I wish we could've stayed little kids. 
 Bye.

 My dad's gonna kill me, isn't he? 
 I spoke to him. 
 He is gonna kill you, but not until after the game. 
 You gonna be all right to play tonight? 
 Hey, you don't happen to know where Jean's brother is, do you? 
 Parents are lookin' for him. 
 They think he was hanging out with Phillip Kopus last night. 
 That sound right to you? 
 I thought that Jean was with Kopus last night. 
 No, she was at a friend's house. 
 She don't know where Brian is, either. 
 You sure you don't know where he is?

 They're helping the cops search the woods. 
 What? 
 Lookin' for Brian Rodgers. 
 Guess he didn't come home last night.

 I was tryin' to find you. 
 I went to your house... you weren't there. 
 Brian told me that he could help me find you. 
 You let me think Phillip was there. 
 That he let him drown. 
 You knew all this time... and you never told me. 
 Your father, the police, everybody said that's what happened. 
 I should've told you I knew different, but I didn't... I'm sorry. 
 I didn't know what I was doing, and by the time I did, it was too late. 
 You're right... it's too late. 
 I can fix this. 
 Leave, Harold.

 I'd do anything for you... anything. 
 All you had to do, was tell me the truth. 
 Please go.

 I'm sorry, man... I didn't know. 
 Oh, no. 
 The cave was busted... everything's gone. 
 We're not gonna be able to deliver. 
 After 3 o'clock, they're gonna come lookin' for me.

 These guys don't make threats... they take people apart. 
 This is serious. 
 You don't know me... you never met me.

 You don't know me... you don't know my name! 
 [Knock at door] 
 Is Phillip here? 
 Um-um. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I heard about the settlement. 
 I don't know what to say about that. 
 Nothin' you can say. 
 Just somethin' you have to live with. 
 It'll fade, but not all the way. 
 Take my word for it. 
 You know, my son's in love with your daughter. 
 I don't know if it's a good thing, but I just thought you should know, he'd do anything for that girl. 
 Tell him to take care of her. 
 Phillip's stayin' at the Camford Inn, on route 17. 
 You need to sit down for a minute? 
 Thank you... I appreciate that, but... I can't stay. 
 What's goin' on? 
 Found these under some debris when they were pullin' the drugs from the mine. 
 Some idiot put it in his report. 
 I want you to head over to the station and amend it... 
 Strike any and all mention of these barrels. 
 No paint sludge... got it? 
 Why? 
 You don't get to ask why. 
 If I amend that report, I gotta put my name on it. 
 Your name? 
 It ain't worth much right now, anyway. 
 Maybe you wanna talk about that gun you found... those two dead detectives? 
 You better make yourself worth all this trouble you're causin' me. 
 I'm not doctoring any reports, Captain. 
 What... what... what'd ya say? 
 I said, "I'm not doctoring any reports, Captain." 
 If that means I'm not worth keeping around... then, don't keep me around. 
 You comin' with us tonight? 
 Yeah. 
 Casey's brother's gonna buy us beer. 
 Can he get me vodka or somethin'? 
 I hate beer. 
 Yeah, whatever you want. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doin'? 
 Whatever she wants to... leave her alone. 
 Shut up. 
 Hey, what's goin' on? 
 Nothin'. 
 I know you... something's wrong. 
 You're just snapping back into your old life, huh? 
 That didn't take long. 
 What did you expect me to do? 
 Well, it doesn't matter. 
 You're not gonna see me, anymore. 
 I'm all done with school. 
 You can't drop out just because of me. 
 Yeah... yeah, it's all because of you. 
 No, that's fine. 
 I'm unsafe to be around, anyway. 
 Stop being so dramatic. 
 If you're in trouble, it's only cause you wanna be. 
 Yeah, whatever... you go back to your boyfriend! 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Hello? 
 Yeah, it's good. 
 It's cold, though. 
 I was thinkin' about headin' back down to your neck of the woods. 
 You think you could set me up with somethin'? 
 I'm kinda runnin' low on funds.

 I always think about this place. 
 Yeah? 
 You took me here for Halloween. 
 I know.

 It was cold. 
 Yeah. 
 You let me wear your jacket. 
 You smoked menthol cigarettes, and you drank... 
 I don't-I don't remember what it was, but it tasted horrible.

 Oh!

 I'm goin' away. 
 No kiddin'? 
 I'm goin' away, too. 
 Where ya headin'? 
 I don't know. 
 You ever get married? 
 Have any kids? 
 [Scoffs] 
 No. 
 Remember what you told me about havin' kids? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I guess you changed your mind. 
 I always... I always thought you'd move away... live in the city.

 I'm not sure I should love anything. 
 I wasn't with your brother that night. 
 I need you to believe me. 
 I know. 
 What do you mean? 
 If you knew, then, why'd you let 'em run me out of town? 
 Harold only told me today. 
 He was with him... they were looking for me. 
 Brian did it to his damn self. 
 That's why I wanted to come see you and... to tell you how sorry I am. 
 You're sorry. 
 You're sorry?
