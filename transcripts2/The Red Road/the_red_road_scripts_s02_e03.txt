 David : I-I don't know why I didn't pick up on it. 
 I talked to him on the phone the day before. 
 He seemed... sad, but-- but... rational, calm. 
 He said he was gonna go to mass with us on Sunday. 
 I had told him... how much it helped us when Brian died. 
 Sylvia : We wouldn't have gotten through it otherwise. 
 Jean : Hmm, well, according to the Bible, he's in Hell right now, isn't that right? And Brian, too? 
 No, sweetie, that's a myth. The Bible doesn't say that. 
 There's-- there's forgiveness for every sin.

 I wanted to see if I could pick up some money dealing for you. 
 I know Mike made pretty good money doing it. 
 You're a drug dealer? 
 No. 
 [ Baby sneezes ] 
 But I think I'd be good at it. 
 I'm out of the drug business. 
 What  are you doing today? 
 What, are you writing a book? I don't know yet. 
 You know, it's been a long time since somebody did something nice for me. 
 I'm sorry to hear that, but I-- 
 I know you did it for the baby and not for me. 
 I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate it. 
 [ Baby coos ] 
 I'm sorry to bother you. 
 I'll let you get back... to whatever. 
 ♪  I ask of Heaven  ♪ 
 You can come in if you want. 
 But it's the maid's day off, so... 
 It's okay.

 Marie : When can we expect this federal aid? 
 Sky : It won't be quick. 
 And if we sue the car company and we win, how long? 
 [ Chuckles ] They'll drag it out as long as they can. 
 Five, six years, maybe more. 
 Got a lot of sick people who can't wait that long. 
 We need money today. 
 We'll have to raise it ourselves. 
 Charlie : Chief, we've been working on a few things we can raise money with now that we're sovereign. 
 The museum for one. 
 And Larry's got some good ideas for the craft shop. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 We can't raise the kind of money we need with museums and craft shops. 
 No offense, Larry. You do some fine things. 
 But we need real money. 
 Eddie : I don't know why we can't talk about gaming. 
 I was out to Pennsylvania last week to see my cousin. 
 They've got a little casino-- nothing crazy-- and they're living like damn kings. 
 Let other tribes chase that crap. 
 We are trying to preserve what we are, not become something else. 
 That's right. 
 If we have the means to help the sick and we don't, we better have a damn good reason. 
 And I'm not sure I'm really hearing one. 
 That's because you're not listening, Chief. 
 Your brother wanted us to set ourselves apart from other tribes, to reclaim the old ways. 
 I know that, but Mac liked books more than he liked people. 
 He thought he could bend reality to his will. 
 And sometimes he did, but mostly he didn't. 
 He was patient. 
 But, as most of you know, I'm surely not. 
 I need to think on this. 
 Council wants us to drive you. 
 Just to make sure you're protected. 
 I got a can of Mace in my glove box. 
 It's only a couple weeks, Chief. 
 You guys aren't Secret Service. 
 You got better things to do than protect me. 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Metal creaks ] 
 Let me fix this before you go. 
 Thing's barely hanging on. 
 It's fine. You don't owe me anything. 
 I get that. But I can't have Mike's kid riding around in a death trap. 
 Why don't you hang here for a half-hour? 
 I'll take this over to my mom's house. 
 Got all my tools over there. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Don't thank me. 
 Thank me again, I'm gonna change my mind. 
 Sorry. 
 No apologies, no thank-yous. 
 Just nothing. 
 It's all I'm looking for-- just nothing. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Okay. 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 I wouldn't have supported you if I knew you were gonna do this. 
 You're not a council member, Sky. 
 You're an adviser, and you advised me. 
 You're in Brooklyn. Talk to me when you get an address on the mountain. 
 All right, you are scared, and I understand this is an overwhelming thing to take on when your brother has just died. 
 Your job is to advise me, not steer me. 
 Look, casinos make sense for us. 
 I get you don't like them. 
 I don't like them, either. 
 [ Door slams open ] 
 Tell us where the money is! 
 Get out of my house! 
 Now! 
 What money?! 
 Did you see this house before you decided to rob it? 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 Okay, okay, okay, don't-- I'll get it. 
 Don't hurt us. I'll get it. 
 Show me. 
 It's in the bedroom. Okay, okay. 
 Let's go. Show me. 
 Just don't hurt us. 
 Sit! 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 [ Gasps ] 
 I'm sorry! I'm sorry. 
 Is this loaded? 
 Uh... no. 
 [ Gun clicks ] 
 Aah! 
 The money! 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Here. 
 That's all there is, I swear. 
 Your son stole 150 grand from us. 
 If you don't tell me where the money is and I end up finding it in this house, I swear to God... the two of you are gonna be begging me to shoot you. 
 Do you understand me?! Do you?! 
 I don't know what you're talking about, I swear. 
 Bring her in here. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Come on! Let's go! Go! Come on! 
 Get in the closet. 
 Get in there! Get in the closet! 
 In the closet! 
 [ Gasps ] 
 I'm sorry. 
 David : We spent last week in upstate New York-- Millerton. 
 It's like Mayberry. 
 Like stepping back into the past. 
 Jean : You've been going up there a lot. 
 Oh, it's beautiful-- the lake, the foliage. 
 We're really falling in love with it. 
 So much so that we bought a house. 
 You're leaving? 
 What? 
 We've been thinking about it for a while, but wanted to keep it a secret until we were sure I was gonna retire. 
 Sylvia : We want you all to come with us. 
 Look, this town will never be the same once the Lenape put up their casino. 
 And you'll love this place. 
 It has a great, little police department, a wonderful school system, and one of the best psychiatric facilities in the country. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 [ Doorbell rings ] 
 We're not leaving, David. 
 Harold, I-I know it's a lot, but please give it some thought. 
 Afternoon, Lieutenant. Um, my condolences. 
 I-I didn't know the Captain personally, but he seemed like a great man. 
 The psychologist from the State Police is at the station all day meeting with officers for mandatory grief counseling. 
 Aschell having a good time running the show over there? 
 Uh, I don't know, sir. 
 I'm just supposed to let you know that grief counseling is mandatory to resume active duty. 
 Woman : 76, you copy? 
 Go ahead. 
 We have a distress call from the Tribal Police at their new Chief's residence. 
 Armed robbery in progress. Lieutenant wants you to respond. 
 Only call for backup if required. 
 Over. 
 Copy that. 
 This is Lieutenant Jensen. 
 You should be sending backup now, over. 
 Following procedure, Lieutenant. 
 Bullshit. 
 Jean : - I don't really want strange people living in my old house. 
 They're gonna change everything. 
 I got to go to work. We'll talk later. 
 You can follow me. 
 You're not on duty, Lieutenant. 
 You don't get to tell me if I'm on duty or not, Reed. 
 Just follow me. We're gonna do something for a change. 
 Yes, sir.

 [ Grunts ] 
 You all right?! 
 [ Dog barking in distance ] 
 Oh, you're welcome, dickhead. 
 Thank you. 
 It's all right. I'm gonna find them. 
 You should let the police handle this. 
 Yeah, because they've been doing such a good job so far. 
 You all right? 
 [ Groans ] 
 Did you hide money in my house? 
 No! 
 No, I said! 
 But you know who they are! 
 No, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out. 
 Where are you going? 
 Huntin'.

 Junior!

 [ Engine idling ] 
 [ Radio chatter ] 
 I got orders from BIA to partner up with one of your guys, search the mountain. 
 I'm gonna need one of you to partner up with Travel. 
 Aschell wants us in town in case they end up there. 
 They're on foot. There's no way they're gonna get as far as town. 
 Got my orders, Lieutenant. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Looks like you're partnering up with me. 
 Think that's about the worst idea I ever heard. 
 How much training have you had? 
 I did two tours in Afghanistan. 
 I'm the one who should be worried, not you. 
 All right, we'll start on Deer Hill and we'll work our way back. 
 No, they're gonna come out on Maris, probably, so we should start there. 
 Fine. We'll take my truck. 
 I don't want to ride in your truck. 
 You can sit in the back if you think it'll be more comfortable. 
 Sylvia : We started in here since-- 
 Jean : You're taking Brian's stuff with you? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 No, actually, we were planning on throwing it out, but if there's something you want, just... 
 Hello? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Hello? 
 We used to listen to my father talking in his office. 
 I think you're remembering wrong, dear. 
 Hmm, no I'm not. 
 Kate, go downstairs into grandpa's office and talk into the vent. 
 What are you doing, sweetie? 
 [ Sighs ] Looking for a vent. 
 You'll be looking for a long time. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Are you playing a joke on me? 
 I thought you said it didn't start until after you were pregnant with Rachel. 
 What? 
 The voices. 
 Mom, you don't have to whisper. She knows. 
 You know she knows. 
 The house must have been different then because I know we could hear you. 
 This is so cool. Can I have this? 
 Brian loved that thing. 
 I always used to imagine that he'd become a doctor or a surgeon or something. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Can you take that out to the car? 
 Yeah. 
 Harold : Yeah, this is Lieutenant Jensen. 
 We're on Deer Hill Road. 
 Can you please run a plate for me? 
 We have a Jersey D3X 846. Over. 
 Man : Running the plates now. Stand by. 
 If it's theirs, maybe they'll try to come back for it. 
 This the first time you ever traveled around here on foot? 
 Don't you guys have a standing order to not get out of your car when dealing with us mountain folk? 
 Well, I can't speak for the rest of our department, but I've done more than my share of walking around up here, yeah. 
 [ Chuckles ] Brave man. 
 Risking your life on this war zone of a mountain. 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 I was stationed in the Helmand Province in Afghanistan. 
 That's what bad looks like. 
 This right here-- this is the safest place in the world. 
 Oh, except for our two armed assailants. 
 Outsiders. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Anytime anything happens over here, it's outsiders. 
 Like your wife, for instance. 
 Hey, that was an accident. 
 You want to hate somebody for it, hate me. 
 You got it. 
 [ Beep ] 
 Go ahead. 
 Those plates belong to a resident. Over. 
 All right, copy that. 
 I just want to hear you admit that you lied about it. 
 I mean, come on. 
 Legally, I can't do anything now if you tell me, so just admit it. 
 My wife's not well. 
 It wasn't her fault. 
 It was mine. 
 Would you like to go sit under the twins for old time's sake? 
 If you sit under the twins, you have to tell the truth. 
 [ Grunting ] Oh, God. 
 Sitting down is getting to be more trouble than it's worth. 
 Stop acting so old. You're not that old. 
 I'm glad  you  think so. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You know, at first, I didn't, uh, like the idea of moving out of this house. 
 This is the place where all my favorite memories were made. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 But, uh, the minute I started packing things up, I felt like a weight was lifting off of me. 
 But what's the point of anything if you don't keep anything, if you don't remember things? 
 The stuff in those boxes is important to me. 
 It's proof that my twin existed. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I love your mind, Jeannie. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 But the only thing that's real is what's happening right now-- you, me sitting under this tree. 
 We... we all lost a piece of ourselves when Brian died. 
 But if I hadn't let certain things go... 
 I... might have ended up like Bill. 
 I never hear them when you're talking. 
 Who? 
 The voices. They're always quiet when you talk. 
 I'm starting a different therapy. 
 I'm trying to really understand what they want. 
 I'm writing things down. 
 And I think they're saying the same thing you are-- that I have to get rid of something. 
 Try starting with one of those boxes and see if you feel any better once you've done it. 
 I don't know. 
 That feels like... murder almost. 
 You're strong enough to try, Jeannie. 
 Will you do me a favor? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Give moving with us some thought. 
 I-I know Harold's against it. 
 But given what happened with Bill, I don't think he's got the best perspective right now. 
 
 
 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 To the Creator, I thank you for my brother. 
 [ Speaks Native language ] 
 Hey! 
 Which way to the Interstate? 
 Half a mile northeast. 
 [ Muffled music playing ] 
 Junior! 
 Where's your boyfriend? 
 He's not my boyfriend. 
 Come on. We got to go. It's not safe up here. 
 I'm waiting for him. I'm not leaving until he gets here. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Why isn't it safe? 
 There's some dangerous men on the loose. 
 More dangerous than you? 
 What if they got Junior? 
 He'll be all right. I taught that kid a thing or two before he wrote me off. 
 The things you taught him just about ruined his life. 
 Stop acting like you were some kind of mentor. 
 Seems like you picked up more from your father than your mother, which is a damn shame. 
 Don't talk about my mother. 
 How's she feeling these days? 
 I told you not to talk about her. 
 Is she gonna get better? 
 [ Scoffs ] What do you care? 
 How is it a guy your age is still obsessed with his high-school girlfriend? 
 It's sad. 
 Just curious. 
 No, she's not gonna get better. 
 She'll have it for the rest of her life. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 She wants to see them crushed. 
 Knock yourselves out. 
 [ Engine idling ] 
 You don't have to do this. 
 [ Box thuds ] 
 [ Whirring ] 
 Man :  [ Distorted ] One, one thousand. 
 Two, one thousand. 
 Three, one thousand. [  Indistinct whispering  ] Four, one thousand. 44, one thousand. 45, one thousand. 46, one thousand. 47, one thousand. 48, one thousand. 49, one thousand. 50, one thousand. Mom. Mom! [ Voices stop ] [ Breathing heavily ] It's okay. I'm okay. Here, you try one. It's fun. Okay. [ Whirring ] Frank : Keep that close. Let me know if you see anything. Appreciate you coming by. Yeah. Gordy, feel better, huh? They haven't seen anything. Oh, and they don't like you, by the way. Yeah. Well, just wait until you've been doing this a couple months. They ain't gonna like you, either. I ain't doing this to be liked. Well, why are you doing it, then, Frank? Huh, well, I actually give a sh1t about this place. I want my son to be safe. I know I can't count on you guys to do that. Oh, right, right. He's, like, the third person I've seen on oxygen. It's lung cancer from the sludge. Well, how can you be sure it's from the sludge? Oh, you think it's from all the fresh air? Well, why don't you move? Well, I'd rather die at home than live in exile. Yeah, but you got a kid. [ Groans ] That's the way, Frank! You feel better now? You finished, or you want to go? I'm good. Listen, Frank. [ Groans ] You gonna let him get away with that? Come on, Frank, you big pussy! Shut up, Gordy. Come on, asshole. We got a lot of ground to cover. [ Crickets chirping ] Junior : What the hell are you doing here? Hey, you need to wake up your girlfriend and come with me. Two guys robbed Marie and Sky earlier. What? Is Marie okay? She's fine, but those two guys are running around out here, so... I think I saw them. I saw them, and I let them go. Where? About a half mile from the Interstate. Well, if you tried to stop them, you'd probably be dead. I think they're the same guys who took out Mac. Just come on. We'll take your girl back, and we'll try and track them down. Do you have any proof? I mean, proof that it was them and not you? Not yet. You got to take it on faith, Junior. The last time I did that, I ended up in juvie. [ Sighs ] That place toughened you up, huh? I didn't like hitting you with a bat, if that's what you mean. You take a lot of beatings in there? Nope. Does that gun actually work? Yeah. You make sure you keep an eye out. Don't go sleeping. Tell mom you're still alive. I can't believe you really came. I'm only here because I was getting worried you were starving to death. I brought some food. You didn't have to. I'm eating fine. And it's all free. It's getting colder out. Freezing outdoors is a stupid way to die, Junior. And you're gonna have all these people going on the news, talking about what an idiot you were. [ Chuckles ] I'm serious! Is Kopus still here? No. I kicked his ass out. He said it wasn't safe. Well, I've got lots of ammo. Don't worry. I set up a couple alarms, too, so I'll know if anybody comes up on us. You're acting crazy. You know that, right? Why's this crazy? I can count on things out here. You better not be talking about me. I tried visiting you, but they wouldn't let me because I'm not family. Well, I'm glad. I wouldn't want you in that place, anyway. I would have, though. [ Chuckles ] I thought about trying to sneak in there once. You can't get into trouble. You're gonna be a big college girl soon. I guess. What did you say you were going for, philosophy? Psychiatry. [ Sighs ] 'Cause of your mom? You think you're gonna fix her or something? What's the matter? [ Police radio chatter ] You staying awake over there? Yep. Good 'cause we might be going all night. If you're trying to say you're tired, I'd be happy to drive. I-I'd prefer it, actually. You're not driving my truck. My son still has one of the things your wife left him. I saw him wearing it this morning. Tried to get him to give it up, but he wasn't having it. What was it? Necklace-- one of those little medals. Guy in my regiment had one. Some saint. White guy with a beard carrying a baby. Yeah, St. Christopher-- patron saint of travelers. Well, see, don't tell me that. Now I got to let him keep wearing it. Hey, here's something. [ Siren chirping ] Harold : Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where you going? Who you giving orders to? You're assisting my ass. Dispatch, can you run a Jersey plate for me, please? Uniform-Juliet-Whiskey, 792. Woman : - Copy that. Stand by. Ahh. Busted my tire on a-a log, some jackass dropped in the road back there. Where you coming from? Newark. What brings you out here? Going down to Airmont to see my parents. We're looking for two men involved in a botched robbery, shot a federal officer. Well, you're... the first car I've seen. [ Metal clanks ] Hey, why don't you take a break? Leave it! Mind getting your license and registration? Pop the trunk for me? Yeah. Yeah, sure thing. Frank. These aren't his plates. [ Gunfire ] [ Groans ] [ Tires screech ] Hey! Stay right there! Stop! Stop! [ Groans ] Okay, go! Go! Get him! [ Breathing heavily ] Hey, this is 994. I need immediate backup. We're on Deer Hill Road. Suspect has been shot. I need an ambulance. [ Police radio chatter ] You're okay. Come on. You're all right. [ Breathing stops ] He lost me on the Interstate. You guys need faster trucks. Hey. We would have had those guys at the house if you hadn't have given the distress call to the rookie. It wasn't my call. I know Captain Warren's policy is to send all mountain calls to the bottom of the responder cue. But he's gone now. We got to use our heads. If you have a problem with it, call the Mayor. What? The orders came down yesterday. They don't want us backing Tribal up at all. Screw the Mayor. We have orders from the feds to assist. Listen. The more it looks like things are going to hell up there, the better the chance the State Gaming Commission will reject their application. Well, they haven't submitted a gaming application. But we both know that they will. [ Chuckles ] One of us is gonna be captain, Harold. And they want somebody who knows what the job is. [ Baby crying ] Fixed the door. Where the hell have you been? I've been stuck in that house all day. There are no diapers for the baby, nothing to eat. Chemical fumes in that house are making me sick. Listen, I think it's best if we steer clear of each other from now on. I don't think it's right. You don't think it's right? That's what I said. Because of Mike? You know what's not right? Leaving town while his pregnant girlfriend has to fend for herself. Mike's an asshole. He's the one who should feel guilty, not you. I don't feel guilty about anything. But I can't be banging my buddy's girl unless he says it's okay. It's late. Where are you? [ TV chatter ] I don't know why you think that's an option. Well, you're lucky your father has something going on at work, otherwise I'd be sending him right now to come and get you. Mm, don't tell your father, okay? And you call me first thing. You're letting her stay there? Quiet. I don't think you should keep those. They're old and dirty. [ Chuckles ] They aren't dirty. Just throw them away for me, okay? Thank you. And I killed him. I just watched the life go out of him. We didn't catch the other guy. What am I doing? What the hell am I doing? You're doing your job. I don't even know what my job is anymore. It's all bullshit. [ Sighs ] Do you want to leave? Do you want to take your dad up on his offer? Only if you do. [ Chuckles ] That's not an answer. For a minute, I thought moving would be good. Leave it all behind. But we just need to let go of the past, and we don't have to move to do that. Okay. But I don't know what's gonna happen. I blew the promotion. I wanted to do right. I wanted you to see me the way you used to see me. I do. No, you don't. And why the hell would you? I mean, I lied to you for so long. Probably made you sicker. You have nothing to do with what's wrong with me. Just get that out of your head. You're a good father. And you stuck with me through everything, when you could have just picked up and left. [ Sighs ] I got this on the way home. I thought it might calm me down. It's not working. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] I'm already turning into Bill. Don't say that. [ Sighs ] What the hell was he thinking making you go over there? It's okay. He was scared. I think he liked that I was there. And I feel good about it. Being there for someone made me feel useful. What is it? Something he said. I could have imagined it, I guess, but the more I think about it... Well, what did he say? He said he killed his wife. And I believed him, even though I know full well she died of lung cancer.
