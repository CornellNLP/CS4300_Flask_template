 [Collective chanting] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Dude, come on-- look out. 
 You playin' war-- cowboys and Indians? 
 You pretend to be the Indians, huh? 
 I ain't pretendin'-- I am an Indian. 
 That's just what the old people around here say make themselves feel important. 
 So wipe that stupid paint off your face. 
 [Chatter] 
 Howdy, ma'am. 
 We're just asking, uh, some of the local residents if they have any information or if they may have heard anything about this kid-- he's from New York City. 
 Went missing up this way about six days ago. 
 He was last seen on Deer Hill Road. NYU student. 
 I called the police last year about a break-in. 
 Took two days for them to send somebody. 
 But some rich kid goes missing, y'all don't waste a damn second. 
 You have a good evening. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Gasps] 
 Get out. 
 Where is he? 
 "Where is he," I said? 
 I sunk him in the lake, all right? 
 No one will find him. 
 They ain't even lookin' over there. 
 They didn't even know my name. 
 The cops been here? 
 No. 
 Did you kill him in the house? 
 It was an accident. 
 I don't care what it was. 
 Did you do it here, in the house? 
 Yeah. 
 Go to the store and buy some bleach, and you scrub this place down, Mike, okay? 
 My dad sent me. 
 I'm gonna be stayin' here awhile. 
 ♪ 
 Why are you doing this? 
 You can't talk to me that way! 
 Go get in the car, right now! 
 Now! 
 What's goin' on? 
 Found that in Rachel's pocket. 
 Okay, I find out that you're still seeing that Indian kid, we're gonna have a problem. 
 We'll have a little talk, later, you and me, okay? 
 [Car engine starting] 
 What-- does she even hear me? 
 Hello-- hello? 
 Junior, you want a sandwich? 
 You can make it yourself. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 It's not a vacation, you know. 
 You're supposed to be on punishment. 
 Yeah, well, the guy I fought didn't get suspended. 
 Yeah, well... and you know why. 
 You really like this girl? 
 Yeah. 
 Ugh! 
 Now, who's this? 
 [Sighs] 
 Your Uncle Mac told me he saw you at the Pow-Wow. 
 I didn't believe him. 
 Can I hug you? 
 Uh, this is Junior. 
 Junior, this is Phillip Kopus. 
 He's one of my boys. 
 Hey. 
 I'm not one of her boys. 
 I'm her son-- the only son. 
 Really? 
 You can't stay here. 
 I'm not looking to. 
 I used to live in this house. 
 No kiddin'? 
 Yeah. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 I gotta go. 
 Bye. 
 [Car engine starting] 
 Mommy! 
 Mommy, where are you? 
 Today, police and volunteers began to search the woods for Denis Bradley, the NYU freshman who was reported missing six days ago. 
 A New York cab-driver came forward this morning and claimed he drove Bradley to a stretch of road in the Lenape mountains. 
 Now, local police are asking, if you have any information at all on Bradley, please call right away. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Hey, buddy, what ya doin'? 
 Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey, stay down. 
 Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey, cut that out-- come on. 
 Don't eat that. 
 Do you really think the sludge is bad for the baby? 
 Billy said he can clean it out of the backyard. 
 Yeah, well, Billy's an idiot, and he can kiss my ass. 
 Here, move that stuff. 
 Congressional recognition has been frozen for too long. 
 My brother's not the best chief we ever had, but he's good on TV. 
 He is. 
 You think he'll ever get them to recognize the tribe? 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Hello-- hello? 
 "Hello," I said. 
 Tell your son, or whatever he is, to leave my daughter alone. 
 You hear me? 
 Who is this-- hello? 
 Do you understand that, or do I need to put it simpler? 
 He's gonna be in trouble. 
 My husband is a police officer, and he's not gonna let that happen. 
 I'm sorry-- I'm-I'm sorry. 
 I don't know who you are, or what you're talk-- 
 Don't-- don't talk. 
 Don't you talk. 
 ♪ 
 I liked it better when my mom was drinking. 
 At least I could do what I wanted. 
 Now that she's cured, she's... obsessed with me. 
 You ever worry about turning into your parents? 
 Me-- no, I never met my parents. 
 So I wouldn't know it, if I did. 
 ♪ 
 My dad once carried my mom all the way home from school. 
 Why? 
 Shut up-- I don't know-- 'cause it's romantic. 
 I suppose. 
 You think you could carry me that far? 
 Hmm? 
 I don't know-- what about that? 
 Oh, I like that. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Harold! 
 Yeah? 
 Come here for a second. 
 What's up? 
 The searchers found these in the woods. 
 That's Jean's brother's, isn't it? 
 I told the detectives it's 20-years-old. 
 It's got nothin' to do with the missing college kid. 
 They still wanna keep it in evidence. 
 Jean doesn't have to know about this. 
 Don't worry, kid-- I got your back. 
 ♪ 
 Dad? 
 Hey. 
 Can I come in? 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah. 
 You don't have to ask-- come on in. 
 Well, are you busy? 
 Do you want me to come back later? 
 I'm your father, all right? 
 Stop being so courteous-- you make me crazy. 
 Come on. 
 I made another one for you. 
 Oh. 
 Is that me? 
 Yeah. 
 Standing guard? 
 I like it. 
 Good. 
 What's up? 
 So, is-is this your room now? 
 I mean, you've been in here for, like, three weeks. 
 Mom said it's still the guest room. 
 Yeah, yeah, well, she's right. 
 It is the guest room. 
 We explained this to you. 
 Your mother was havin' trouble sleeping with me in there, while she's gettin' sober. 
 So I'll be back in there soon. 
 Okay, so, uh, so, you guys aren't getting divorced? 
 No... no. 
 That's never gonna happen. 
 All right? 
 Okay. 
 Don't worry. 
 All right, move your head. 
 Why do you watch this? 
 I like it. 
 Even though it broke your back? 
 Especially 'cause it broke my back. 
 [Car alarm blaring] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Knocking on door] 
 He's down there. 
 Hey, what happened, buddy? 
 Hey, what's happened? 
 Hey. 
 How many dogs you murder, and the one you decide to keep can't see? 
 It's not my dog. 
 I'm watchin' him for somebody, okay? 
 Hey, come on outta here, all right? 
 You don't get the run of my house-- let's go. 
 Come on-- man. 
 You look good-- you look good. 
 Mike sunk the body in the lake. 
 They ain't lookin' over there. 
 It's like you said, he ain't got sh1t. 
 That's all he had. 
 You'll turn it around. 
 Yeah, I told you I would. 
 What about Mike? 
 What about Mike? 
 What about him? 
 I'm not killin' Mike. 
 That's funny, how your mind jumps right to killin'. 
 I didn't say that-- I meant, uh, you know... keep him in line. 
 That's what I'm doing. 
 As soon as the cops stop lookin' for the kid, I'll have you back in business, yeah? 
 Damn... that cologne. 
 You're not supposed to put so much on. 
 Did nobody tell you that? 
 [Chuckles] Um, no. 
 You know, you could be a little more gracious. 
 Hey, you remember the last time they were lookin' for somebody in those woods? 
 Whole city of Walpole wanted to string you the hell up. 
 Who helped you out? 
 And here I am again, with ways for you to make some money, while the rest of the world is tryin' to flush your ex-con ass down the toilet. 
 You should be kissin' my feet. 
 You don't like my cologne, too damn bad. 
 You wanna suck my titty, you're gonna smell my cologne. 
 And I ain't sayin' nothin' about the amount. 
 Now, you try passin' a wad this light off again... 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm gonna have to find somebody else... son or no son, ya know. 
 Get outta here. 
 [Glass breaking] 
 I can't handle it when you talk to me like that! 
 Answer the question-- I called Jenny's house! 
 She said you weren't there! 
 Hey-hey-hey-hey! 
 I don't wanna hear it! 
 What the hell is goin' on? 
 Hey. 
 What's goin' on? 
 Go back to bed. 
 Honey, why don't we talk to her in the morning? 
 I'm talking to her now-- it's okay, Harold. I'm handling it. 
 It's okay. 
 All right. 
 [Sighs] 
 I want you to listen to me. 
 Okay, I need you to understand something. 
 Kate, I know you're awake-- you need to hear this, too. 
 You know my brother drowned... but he didn't need to. 
 A Lenape boy I used to know got him messed up on drugs... and made him go swimming in the lake, and just watched... watched him drown. 
 Let him die. 
 I want you to think about that. 
 [Sighs] 
 You been here before? 
 No. 
 He told me to stop by. 
 Hey, uh, what's up? 
 I know this is a lot to ask, but we need a place to stay for a couple of days. 
 Honey, you look all kinds of familiar to me. 
 Who do you look like? 
 Don't look like anybody famous. 
 Yeah, you can stay here. 
 My room is off-limits, though. 
 Oh, me and my buddy, Mike, are gonna go on a hike. 
 You wanna come along, Junior? 
 Show your girlfriend some trails? 
 Hey, do you wanna? 
 Yeah. 
 Stop trying to act like I'm scared. 
 Don't embarrass me in front of your uncle. 
 Oh, I'm his brother. 
 Come on in. 
 Come on in. 
 It's pretty here. 
 I'm used to it. 
 So, it's not pretty, 'cause you're used to it? 
 Pretty much. 
 You know where we're going, right? 
 Didn't that guy get lost out here? 
 
 
 
 ♪ 
 What do ya think? 
 Wow! 
 Pretty cool, huh? 
 Don't scream-- roof might cave in. 
 Come on. 
 This is where we're gonna keep it all. 
 You can get back here without me? 
 I'll pay attention on the way out. 
 Pay attention now, Mike-- I want you to live. 
 I used to come here when I was in high school. 
 This was kind of, uh... my place. 
 Had a lot of parties here. 
 Mike, you got a light? 
 Yeah... a lot of parties. 
 Here it is. 
 Here you go-- have a merry Christmas, Junior. 
 Oh, nice. 
 [Indistinct] 
 [Rachel screams] 
 [Philip laughing] Knock it off. 
 It's just an air-gun, Mikey. 
 Come on-- get off me, get off me, man. 
 Y'all must think I'm a killer. 
 Think I'd just turn and give it to ol' Mikey here. 
 Can I try it? 
 You wanna try it? 
 Yeah? 
 Come on over here and get comfortable. 
 Okay, I wanna go now.
