 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 Detective : You and your father were a team. 
 That a fair statement? 
 [ Chuckles ] No. 
 He killed four cops. 
 Yeah, I heard you the first time. I wasn't there, so-- 
 Your face already looked like hamburger when they brought you in, so we can beat on you all night. 
 Nobody's gonna know the difference. 
 I told you-- I wasn't working with my father. 
 I was driving the prisoner to the station. 
 We were stopped at a red light. 
 Car pulls up alongside. 
 Three guys inside. 
 Two have automatic weapons aimed at my vehicle. 
 They told me to pull over or they'd start shooting. 
 I pulled into an abandoned lot. 
 I wanted to lead them as far away from civilian traffic as possible before I stopped the truck. 
 Aschell : We don't have any witnesses who say they saw these guys pull up on you. 
 Yeah, well, that's what happened. 
 Detective #2 : Keep going. 
 They followed us into the lot. 
 The officer got out of the truck, and he started trying to talk to them. 
 And you're claiming you've never met these men before? 
 That's right. 
 Probably some guys my old man screwed over. 
 That's 'cause you two are a team, right? 
 No, but, unfortunately, I'm his son, so smart people like you and these Albanians usually end up thinking we work together. 
 You never asked if he's alive. 
 You're right-- I haven't. 
 He's still holding on. 
 If there's a God, your dad will be dead by morning. 
 Then I guess he'll probably live, won't he? 
 So, the officer tries talking to these guys. Then what? 
 They tell him to drop his gun and get back in the truck. 
 So, you surrendered your weapon  and  your prisoner? 
 Well, I guess you would have done something different? 
 Nobody's making any judgments. 
 We just want to make sure you're protected. 
 Go ahead. 
 After I got in the truck, they started beating on him, so, you know, it looked like they had intent to kill. 
 So I grabbed a pistol from the glove box that I'd confiscated earlier and fired several shots out the windshield. 
 I hit one of them, and they returned fire as I got out, and while using the truck as cover, I managed to take out the second. 
 What about the one with the broken neck? 
 Well, that was an accident. 
 I was just trying to keep him from shooting the cop. 
 See, it's like I said-- my dad is a cop  killer. 
 I'm a cop  saver. 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 Can you confirm, for the record, that after the shootout, while you and the prisoner were waiting for help to arrive, there was no discussion whatsoever between the two of you? 
 That's correct. 
 So, what's gonna happen to him? 
 Well... he's a repeat offender, assaulted two of our guys. 
 He'll do some time. 
 I want it noted in the report that he saved my life. 
 You saved  his  first. 
 Just make sure it's in there, all right? 
 Well, that's your call. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 So, am I gonna lose my job over this? 
 Well, you did your duty, put your life on the line. 
 And one of those dirtbags you killed is wanted for killing a DEA agent in the Bronx. 
 Lose your job? 
 sh1t, Harold, you'll probably be promoted. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Bernard : That's infected, buddy. 
 Melvin : How'd you get that? 
 All I can say is, when it comes to improvising a prison weapon, you can't beat the Albanians. 
 Don't get these two talking. 
 I want to finish this stretch before lunch. 
 [ Indistinct shouting, horn honking ] 
 You'd think it was the 4th of July or something. 
 They know it's their last weekend to use the mountain before it's ours. 
 No doubt they'll do their damndest to leave it a holy mess. 
 Man : Oww! Whoo! 
 [ Shouting continues ] 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Hip-hop music plays ] 
 [ Motor revs ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Hey! 
 You gonna pick that up? 
 Indians can pick it up. 
 You're, what, 16? 
 Pour all that out-- every can. 
 If I find any empties laying around, I'll come find you. 
 Reed : Look, guys, it's not open for debate. 
 Reed. 
 Guys, you know damn well you can't hunt black bear up here till December. 
 It won't be our mountain in December. 
 There's a lot of mountains in the world. 
 Go find another one. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hey, Dispatch, can you please relay this message to all units? 
 This is Lieutenant Jensen reminding you all that until Monday, our department is still solely responsible for public safety on this mountain. 
 So I recommend you all get off your asses, get the hell up here, and do your jobs. 
 Dispatcher : 10-4. Will notify. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Whoo! 
 [ Dog barks ] 
 We ought to be hunting  them. 
 Told you not to talk like that. 
 Your friends in juvie talk like that. 
 I don't  have  any friends in juvie. 
 So you probably don't want to go back, do you? 
 I heard your friend Kopus just got out of big-boy prison. 
 He almost made a murderer out of me. 
 I don't trust that guy no more. 
 Wish Marie would follow your lead. 
 Did you go see her yesterday? 
 She's your mother. 
 She's not my mother. 
 My mother's dead. 
 She raised you. 
 I know. 
 I love her for it, but she's not my mother. 
 I want to wait till Monday to go hunting. 
 We'll have the whole place to ourselves. 
 I feel like hunting  today. 
 So we're gonna hunt. 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 I've never seen this place before. 
 Yeah, I'm probably one of the last ones to know how to find it. 
 Now  you  know how to find it. 
 Man who owned the mines lived here. 
 My dad worked for him. 
 He crawled in tunnels, digging iron out of the earth-- iron the country used for cannonballs, chain link. 
 He mounted that in there. 
 Made this rifle a lot heavier-- a pain to carry. 
 Not lightweight, like that nice one you've got there. 
 It looks brand-new. 
 Yeah. Like it? 
 Who'd you buy that off? 
 Came in the mail. 
 I've never kept anything he sent me. 
 It doesn't mean anything if I keep it. 
 Marie told you that he abandoned your mother after you were born. 
 He knew she was having problems with drugs, but he didn't raise a hand to help her. 
 Or  you,  for that matter. 
 He did some things worth admiring in his time. 
 But it's all changed now. 
 You want to trade? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 This here's a fine rifle. 
 'Course, on the other hand, you could say it's a piece of crap, not worthy of hunting squirrels, let alone a deer. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 We'll see. 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Parking brake engages ] 
 [ Dog barking ] 
 [  Indistinct talking on TV  ] 
 Hey, my parole officer call? 
 Marie : No. 
 [ Baby fusses ] 
 You mind sharing Junior's room? 
 Thought he was staying with Mac. 
 He is. 
 I meant with our  new  guests. 
 The Hendriks are here, the Dekkers. 
 Whole lot of people coming back. 
 Right. Government's gonna tell us we're a real tribe. 
 Here I thought we already were. 
 Listen to you. Don't have a clue what you're talking about. 
 You know how much federal aid we're gonna be getting? 
 Guarantee it won't be much, so let's stop taking in people you're gonna have to share it with. 
 You mean people like  you? 
 [ Baby crying ] 
 Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. 
 Okeydoke. Here we go. 
 Oh, I got you. 
 Look at that big boy. 
 Look at those eyes. 
 Can't believe he'd just run off and leave this baby. 
 Who you talking about? 
 Mike. 
 Hmm? 
 Sonya : He's hungry. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 There you go. 
 Oopsy-daisy. 
 Okay. 
 I think I'm gonna find someplace else to stay. 
 Oh, don't sleep in your truck. 
 More room in there than there is in here. 
 Why don't you go to Mrs. Spronk's house? 
 I haven't seen her since I was a kid. 
 She didn't like me much  then. 
 She passed away about a month ago. 
 Cancer came back. 
 That doesn't mean  yours  will. 
 Point is, her place is sitting empty. 
 Yeah. All right. 
 Hold on a second. 
 You're gonna need some light. 
 [ Fire crackling ] 
 Where you been at? 
 I hope you got some decent firewood. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 One of those jackasses left it to rot. 
 Those jackasses... had nothing to do with the death of  that  deer. 
 That's paint sludge. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 We're gonna sue that car company, right? 
 Damn right we are. 
 We got to get her in the ground. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Speaking native language ] 
 Sometimes I don't like this world too much. 
 Remember what I told you? 
 This world isn't real. 
 It's just a shadow of the real one. 
 [ Speaks native language ] 
 [ Speaks native language ]

 You're not sleeping enough. 
 It helps. 
 All the books say it helps. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What are you doing? 
 Filling out your financial-aid form. 
 We need to get it in before Monday. 
 Can you print me up another one? 
 What? I was gonna throw it away for you. 
 I'll  throw it away. 
 Why can't I see it? 
 Because I'm your mother, not your test subject. 
 I want to switch to the generic clozapine. 
 Well, they told us the one you're on now is better. 
 Look, don't worry about the money, okay? 
 I'm gonna get this promotion, and we're gonna be fine. 
 Just concentrate on yourself. 
 I'm tired of concentrating on myself, Harold. 
 I want to do something useful around here. 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 You moving up in the world? 
 Yeah. I've seen your house. 
 Ain't nothing to write home about, either. 
 How'd you find me? 
 I asked your mother. 
 Just want to talk, find out what your plans are. 
 Other than burning this garbage, I  got  no plans. 
 Well, take it to the dump. 
 We got a local ordinance against burning trash. 
 Or what? You're gonna write me a ticket? 
 No, I'm warning you so I don't have to. 
 Yeah, I'll write you a ticket. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Jesus. You're as fun as ever. 
 I'm gonna miss you when the Tribal Police take over. 
 Well, the feds are having us back them up while the BIA trains them, so don't get too excited. 
 What is that? 
 Lieutenant. 
 So we lie, we cheat, you get a promotion, and I get prison. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 God bless America. 
 Amen. 
 Oh, and they're making me captain before long, so... 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 ...don't go making any trouble for me. 
 Hear what I'm saying? 
 Yeah. 
 Now, are you here because you think casinos are coming? 
 See that? 
 That's the only reason I'm here. 
 Soon as it's off, I'll be somewhere else. 
 All right. 
 Well, you just stay far away from me and my family, obey the law, and we'll be fine. 
 You don't owe me. I don't owe you. 
 Have a nice life. 
 I will. Thank you. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Sorry to make you come over here, Harold, but I can't lift him. 
 He's been hitting it pretty hard since we found out I have cancer. 
 I'm more worried about  you than him. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'll get him some water. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 What are you doing here? 
 We should get you in the shower, Captain. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Here we go. All right? 
 
 
 
 [ Dishes clanking ] 
 I didn't mean to get that drunk. 
 You don't have to say anything, Captain. 
 I  am  gonna talk to the Mayor for you-- tell him I want you to take over for me when I retire next year. 
 I told you-- you don't have to do that. 
 If you want the job, I do. 
 It's not gonna be enough. 
 You know they like Lieutenant Aschell better. 
 Who does? 
 The guys you're gunning to lead. 
 You keep to yourself too much. 
 So serious all the time. 
 Aschell's out at the bar with them almost every week. 
 You got to lighten up a bit, learn to be more social. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Schneider : The worst game I ever saw. 
 I fell asleep before the end of the first quarter. 
 Olson : Had nothing to do with the game. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Hey. 
 Listen, uh, I'm sorry if... you know, I got a little heated on the radio the other day. 
 What are you guys doing tonight? 
 Thought we weren't allowed any more overtime. 
 No, not work. I mean, you guys want to come over? 
 I'll grab some beers. We'll play cards. 
 What do you like? Texas hold 'em? 
 We play deuce-to-seven triple draw. 
 Deuce-to-seven triple draw it is, then. 
 What do you say? 7:00? 
 Hey. 
 Tell your wife to stop leaving things on our doorstep. 
 She's scaring my son. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 My son found another one yesterday. 
 They're shooting anything and everything, just leaving them to rot. 
 People from Walpole, they still using that same access road? 
 [ Scoffs ] All the time. They all know it's sacred land. 
 Well, there are probably things we could do to discourage them. 
 Only problem is, I'm on parole, and I can't afford to get my hands dirty with anything. 
 But... maybe I could supervise. 
 Now we're talking. 
 ♪  got 13 months of bad luck  ♪ 
 Kopus : [ Laughs ] Whoo-hoo! 
 See some bumps coming up. Make sure you secure that load. 
 You got it, boss. 
 Yeah! 
 Whoo! 
 [ Laughs ] 
 ♪  stretchin' across my path  ♪ 
 Whoo! 
 You want a beer? 
 Nah. Only drink when I'm not having fun. 
 ♪  ooh, there's a shadow on my back  ♪ 
 I feel so ridiculous. 
 Why did I do that? 
 I'm getting better. I really am. 
 I know you don't believe me. 
 Of course I believe you. 
 Look, you're still willing to trust me after everything I did. 
 Okay? 
 I know how hard you're trying. 
 I don't think I can even return any of this stuff. 
 I mean, we need the money, and I'm just throwing it away. 
 It doesn't-- it doesn't matter. 
 This boy, a-- he's always thinking about what a horrible person I am, and I just want him to stop. 
 Okay, no, he's not thinking that. 
 Honey, he's not thinking about you. 
 Hey. 
 He's okay. 
 He's a happy, healthy kid now. 
 Hey. 
 But you're still getting better. 
 It's okay. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 It's okay. 
 [ Both chuckle ] 
 Really. 
 Come here. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Didn't you say you had something to do tonight? 
 I was thinking of having the guys over for a poker night. 
 I'll tell them we'll do it next week. 
 What? Why? No. They should come. 
 I'll make something. 
 No. 
 You said that these guys need to like you. I want to help. 
 That was a stupid idea anyway. 
 I-I don't even know how to play the kind of poker they're into. 
 Look it up on the computer. 
 I'll make something nice. 
 I'm not going to embarrass you. You don't have to worry. 
 I'm not worried. 
 So, how about, uh... how about that? 
 Probably should have folded, Lieutenant. 
 All right. 
 I guess it's been a while. 
 Okay, this is spicy. No wimps need apply. 
 Ooh. 
 Hey. You want to play? 
 I don't know how. 
 Oh, that's all right. Neither does your husband. 
 Ha. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You boys have fun. 
 [ Scoffs ] Look at you. 
 You trying out for a job at the Lenape Casino? 
 Haven't you heard? They're not building any casinos. 
 Hey, do we really have to work with their rent-a-cops? 
 Only if they need us-- and they will. 
 They're only gonna have  one  patrol car. 
 BIA sent a fed to train them. 
 Schneider : I think my radio's gonna go out when I get  that  call. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Excuse me. Our daughters are hungry. 
 You know he's out now-- the Lenape whose ass you saved last year. 
 Mm. And? 
 He ever thank you for doing that for him? 
 No. 
 Olson : [ Scoffs ] 'Course he didn't. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, I'm off duty. 
 He's where? 
 Well, if nobody's available, he'll just have to wait. 
 Tell him to stay in his car. 
 All right. 
 The rookie blew the axle on his cruiser. 
 He's stuck on the mountain. 
 [ All chuckle ] 
 Let's go have some fun with this kid. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Yeah. 
 All right, we'll take my truck. 
 Grab the beer. Let's do it. 
 All right. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ Dog barking in distance ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Scattered chuckling ] 
 Sorry, Lieutenant. I-I-I didn't even see those things. 
 Schneider : Didn't they teach you how to drive in the academy? 
 Myers : Look at him. Kid's ready to piss his pants. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Don't give him a hard time. 
 He's not used to being out without his mommy. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 What the hell did you run over? 
 Schneider : Look at that. 
 They put them there on purpose. 
 What? 
 [ Twig snaps ] 
 Hey, put that away. Believe it or not, kids play out here. 
 Kids play in Iraq, too. 
 [ Twig snaps ] 
 You hold it right there. 
 Sounded like you guys needed some help. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You trying to tell us you were out there waiting to help somebody? 
 My home's just 100 yards away. 
 You got my dog barking. 
 Yeah, w-we're good. 
 Thanks. 
 He's the Chief. Just... put your guns away. 
 Schneider : Be happy to as soon as the Chief here drops that rifle. 
 Hey, don't make me ask you again. 
 He's got a gun. 
 All right, lower your weapons. That's an order! 
 Him first. We're the cops, Lieutenant. 
 Olson : Bet he's the one who dumped those logs on the road. 
 [ Twig snaps ] 
 sh1t! 
 [ Dog barking ] 
 [ Panting ] 
 All right, give me your gun. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Give me your gun, go wait in the car, and don't get out until the tow truck gets here. 
 Schneider : Harold, you know they put that on the road-- 
 Let's go. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Thanks for sitting down with me. 
 I'm sure you're busy getting ready for your big celebration. 
 He doesn't want it. 
 Fair enough. 
 But that's not what I came to talk about. 
 You know... 
 I think I'm probably the only chief in the Northeast who hasn't spent the last 15 years trying to kill your recognition bid. 
 That's true. 
 But not trying to kill us doesn't make you a friend. 
 Well, as long as my son is a member of  your  tribe, I'm a friend. 
 But tomorrow, when you're officially recognized, you're going to wake up to a thousand enemies. 
 You've accomplished something here, Mac. 
 You should be proud of that. 
 But your problems are just beginning. 
 We went through it ourselves. 
 Other tribes, the mob, your own people-- they'll all be coming after you looking to wipe you out or exploit you. 
 It's a gold rush. 
 And you can tell them that you don't plan on building casinos, but they'll never believe you. 
 We survive. 
 There's so much more to life than just surviving. 
 So, if you should come around to wanting to build something here-- and you will-- 
 I can help make that happen. 
 Money's a white man's weapon. 
 If I fight the way they do, I'm not really fighting. 
 I'm disappearing. 
 I bet my son just loves to hear you talk like that. 
 It's inspiring stuff, Mac. 
 So, congratulations on your accomplishment. 
 And give my regards to your sister. 
 All right, I've heard enough. 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 Hey. 
 Need to talk to you. 
 What'd you end up doing with all that old fence lumber we pulled up? 
 Sell it for salvage, like I asked you? 
 Don't bother making up a story. 
 Melvin and Bernard already confessed. 
 We're just trying to keep those idiots off the mountain. 
 Figured being a member of the tribe, you'd appreciate that. 
 It's funny you bring that up. 
 'Cause I called the Chief this morning and asked him what your deal was. 
 He told me he disenrolled you after you got arrested last year. 
 Disenrolled? What the hell does that mean? 
 Means he kicked you out. 
 Sorry, but I can't have you work for me anymore. 
 The only reason I hired you was 'cause I thought I was helping out a fellow Lenape. 
 God made me Lenape, asshole-- not Mac. 
 [ Drumming, bells jingling, man chanting ] 
 Maria : Be careful with those fireworks. 
 They won't be blowing up my boy. 
 This ain't the first time I've done this. 
 Remember, when Mac gets back, I want a picture of you and him. 
 You and me, too. 
 And I want smiles. 
 I  always  smile. 
 No, you and Mac always have that same stupid expression. 
 So damn serious. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Drumming, jingling, chanting continue ] 
 Where's Mac? I need to talk to him. 
 Some manners on you. 
 They're getting a lot worse the longer you keep me standing here. 
 Where is he? 
 Went home. Wanted to be alone for a bit. 
 Said he'd be back before the fireworks. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Fireworks popping ] 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 Mac! 
 You up there? 
 I want to talk to you. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 [ Tires squeal ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Footsteps approaching ] 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Junior. Listen, hold up. 
 Get off me. 
 Get off me! 
 Don't go up there. 
 Don't go up there. 
 Junior. 
 Mac. 
 Oh, no. 
 I didn't do that, Junior. 
 [ Crying ] 
 It wasn't me, man. 
 [ Dialing ] 
 [ Ringing ] 
 Dispatcher : 911. What's your emergency? 
 Yeah. Someone was shot. 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 Tribal Police want to take you in. 
 They think you were looking for payback because he disenrolled you from the tribe. 
 Yeah, I shot him when I was on parole, then I called the cops to come and arrest me afterwards. 
 Hey, Junior. Hey, hold up. 
 I got here first. Did he tell you that? 
 Hey, you're in shock, Junior. 
 You don't have to say anything right now. 
 I got here first, then he drove up afterwards. 
 Is he pressuring you to say that? 
 Nobody's pressuring me. 
 Okay, well, you can tell that to the feds when they get here in the morning. 
 Feds? 
 Yeah, this mountain's sovereign land now. 
 Our department's only allowed to offer support. 
 The FBI handles homicides. 
 You make sure you stay local. 
 I'm gonna call your parole officer, make sure he checks the GPS on that thing. 
 Hey. 
 You didn't have to do that. 
 But I appreciate it. 
 I promise you we're gonna find out who did this, okay? 
 I  already  found him. 
 And I'm gonna kill him myself.
