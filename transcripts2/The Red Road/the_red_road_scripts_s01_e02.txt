 ♪ 
 Harold Jensen : Ow! 
 Come on. [ Grunts ] 
 ♪ ♪ ♪ 
 Kate Jensen : Hey. What's going on? 
 Nothin'. You and your sister can stay home from school today. 
 Stay here with your mom, okay? 
 Uh, but what's happening? 
 Nothin'-- it's okay. 
 [ Telephone ringing ] 
 Hello? Hello? 
 Jean Jensen : I think I killed it. 
 Rachel said it was a dog or a deer. 
 You talked to Rachel about what happened? 
 When? 
 I'm not gonna drink anymore. 
 Never again-- I promise. 
 What were you drinking? I didn't smell any booze on you. 
 Didn't seem like you were drunk. 
 It's all gone. 
 Well, what was it? Where'd it come from? 
 What difference does it make? 
 You're sayin' you were drunk, and you weren't! Look, what were you-- what were you gonna do? What were you gonna do with my gun? Is something going on I don't know about? 
 Harold, you said you understood. We talked about this already. 
 About what? 
 Last night, when you came in here, I told you. 
 Rachel told me. Rachel told me to take the gun. 
 Sylvia, it's Harold. 
 Uh, no-- Jean, um... she fell off the wagon last night. It was pretty bad. 
 I know-- I know. 
 Um, I gotta get to work. 
 I don't think she should be alone. 
 Could you-- Thanks. 
 [ Door creaking ] 
 Phillip Kopus : Sounds the same as it used to. 
 You know, I can fix this up, if you want me to. 
 Marie : I'm on my way out. I'm going to see the police. 
 Yeah-- what about? 
 That woman hittin' my car. 
 Paige : You ready? 
 We gotta go. 
 I need to talk to you about what happened last night. 
 Go warm up the car. 
 I'll be right out. 
 You're gonna make this lady look guilty. 
 Okay by me. That boy could die. 
 They had to put him out this morning to keep his brain from swelling. Frank and Iana are a mess! 
 Yeah, but Jean didn't do it. I ran into her, right after I left here. We were catching up. 
 We used to see each other a little bit in high school, remember? She's married to a cop, so you know I'd be the first to say so if I thought she did it, but she didn't. 
 She's got kids. She would've stopped. 
 All right, forget it. You go talk to the police. 
 They'll fix it up. They always do, right? 
 Damn it! 
 Okay, so, we know that this college kid was last seen on Deer Hill Road. 
 So, we'll move along the same perimeter. 
 Okay, and then, Vic-- ic, you wanna come here? 
 Vic's gonna help us with the search today. 
 He's gonna lead us through all the old mining areas. 
 Make sure that we stay safe. Now, if this kid is out there, chances are, he's hurt. Okay, he's gonna be caught up in something, and it will get cold tonight. 
 [ Telephone ringing ] 
 So, uh, just make sure you guys dress accordingly. Sorry-- you wanna, uh, just show 'em those areas. Yeah? 
 Harold, how's sh1t town? 
 Same as you left it. 
 Are you playing detective over there? 
 Somethin' like that. You find anything on him? 
 Well, nothing in Jersey, but I went the extra mile for ya-- called around. Found a Phillip Kopus, who did six years down in Florida. 
 Got out last month. Convicted of engaging in a criminal enterprise. 
 Criminal enterprise? 
 Part of a larger drug trafficking case. 
 That's all I could find out. 
 Captain Warren : - Harold? 
 Got a second? 
 Hey, you there? 
 Uh, thanks, Martin. I owe you one. 
 Yeah, you bet. 
 There was a hit and run up in the mountains last night. Victim's still in the hospital. 
 Lenape kid named Paul Morgan. 
 That was the lawyer for the victim's family. 
 She says she's got witnesses saying Jean was the driver. 
 Jean? 
 Yeah. 
 My Jean? 
 Yeah, your Jean. 
 And you believe it? 
 I'm just telling you what she said. Well, Harold, whatever this is, I want you to know I take care of my men. 
 But I can't do that, if you're not bein' straight with me. So, if there's anything you wanna tell me, now would be the time, and I'll protect ya. God as my witness. 
 I told you about the trouble we've been havin' with Rachel. 
 Jean, uh... I guess she drove up there. 
 Jesus, Harold. 
 She got into it with the boy's mother. 
 She was really driving around up there? 
 Yeah, I mean, she might've made some enemies, but she sure as hell didn't hit anybody, Captain. 
 All right, okay. 
 But this lawyer's startin' to make some noise. 
 The whole tribe's up in arms. You know, they love playin' the victim. 
 Okay. 
 Harold. Mind if I send somebody to take some photos of the car? Wanna nip this thing in the bud. 
 Yeah. 
 Sylvia : I called the store for you. 
 I told them you were sick. You're gonna have to start thinking about how this is affecting the rest of us, Jeanie. Kate and Rachel especially. 
 It's not just you. And your father has an election coming up, and all the incumbent state senators are gonna be fighting to keep their seats, with this redistricting thing. Your father's gonna want you back in AA, immediately. 
 Did you put something in this-- it tastes old. 
 You want me to make a fresh pot? 
 I wanna be home. 
 You are home. 
 No, I wanna be in our house, where Brian was. [ Doorbell rings ] 
 Yeah? 
 Good afternoon, Mrs. Jensen. 
 Oh, my God. 
 No-no-no-no, he's fine. 
 He's fine. Um, I'm sorry. 
 We-- He didn't tell you? 
 No. 
 We're supposed to come by and take some pictures of the vehicle. 
 Pictures-- what do you mean? 
 Jean? 
 Hey, guys. You're early. 
 Harold, what's going on? 
 Nothing-- it's, uh, we'll-we'll talk in a minute. 
 Come on. 
 Hey, I'm real sorry about this, Harold. 
 Yeah. Just following orders. 
 Yeah, I get it, I get it. You wanna just make it fast, okay? 
 Yeah-- come on. 
 There you go. 
 ♪ 
 Hey, Harold, can we get some more light in here? 
 Harold? 
 Sorry-- what? 
 Can we get this door open? Need some more light. 
 Thanks. 
 What is that? Is that a Savage 310? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 I think we got what we need. 
 Great. Thanks, Harold. 
 Take care. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 [ Garage door closing ] 
 Why are they looking at my car? 
 I called David. He's coming over with a lawyer. 
 No-no-no-no. That's not necessary. 
 I have this under control. 
 What do you have under control? 
 Come here. 
 Some people are saying that-that you hit somebody, but it's-it's fine. The car is fine-- it wasn't you. 
 It wasn't fine, Harold. When I hit the dog, I felt it. 
 No, no, baby. You're tired, okay? 
 You're under stre-- ou're just tired. 
 You're not thinkin' straight. Hello? 
 Damn! Come here. 
 All right, I gotta get to work. Okay? 
 Okay, yeah. 
 Mommy? [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 Mommy? 
 Mommy? Mommy? 
 Mommy, it's almost time. 
 [ Dial tone ] 
 Come on, man. What was that? 
 Phillip : Hey, little cowboys. Wanna try a real gun? 
 Look at that. 
 [ Chuckling ] 
 Whoa! 
 There you go. 
 Whoa-- almost. You ever been to juvie? 
 My brother went. He said it sucks. 
 Well, he wasn't lyin'. I was in there when I was a little bit older than you. I met some guys worse than anybody I ever met in state prison. 
 And your guards, they're all pervs. 
 [ Gunshot firing ] You almost had that one. 
 I heard y'all saw who hit your buddy. 
 Yeah. You tell the police? 
 Uh, I told my dad, and he called the police. 
 Did you give a statement? 
 Not yet. 
 Well, be careful, if you do. 
 They love twistin' things. Hey, how old do you gotta be to ride on public lands? Used to be 16. 
 What is it now? 
 Still 16? 
 That's what I thought. Watch this. 
 [ Gunshots firing ] 
 I'm glad Sylvia called me. 
 Harold : - I don't even know why we're doing this. She's been shaky all morning. 
 The longer she waits, the guiltier she's gonna look. 
 This is necessary. Irv knows what he's doing. 
 About what time? 
 Jean : - Five-- five or six. 
 And you said it was dark? 
 Yes. 
 Sun goes down about a quarter to 7. 
 You sure it was between 5 and 6? 
 Maybe it was later. 
 Hey, it's okay. 
 It's not a test. I just want you to be as specific as possible. Um, what was your purpose for driving out there? 
 I was looking for Brian. 
 And who's Brian? 
 He's my twin. 
 Irv Nesbitt : I, um, I think my client misspoke. 
 Her-her brother's deceased. 
 Sorry. It's hard to think. 
 It's okay. 
 I was looking for Rachel. 
 My daughter, Rachel. I could hear her calling for me... screaming. 
 She can't hold her breath as long as Brian can. 
 She's a little girl. She can talk without opening her mouth. 
 Let-let's stop. 
 Uh, my client's understandably under a lot of stress. 
 I-I think that we need to postpone. 
 Hey. 
 I wanna go to our house. 
 Uh, honey, are you-you sure? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 O-okay. Uh, why don't you head out to the car with Harold, and I just have to talk to Bill for a minute. It's okay. 
 Thanks-- come on. Irv, come with me. 
 It's okay. 
 Party for Rooster Garret, in 110. 
 Excuse me. Who are you here to see? 
 Mike : Party for my Uncle Rooster, in 110. 
 I set up a big buy. We need a lot of product. 
 You trust the guard? 
 Yeah, I used to sell him meth. He just wants a piece of whatever we get. 
 You go scope out where they keep the pills. 
 The Lenape community is up in arms. 
 Police have not made any comment, have not identified any suspects, as of yet, but they do have both sides of the road blocked off right now... 
 You get that scrip? 
 Yeah-- boy charged me two hundred bucks for it. 
 You gotta take it to Campbell's Drugstore, in Airmont. The pharmacist there is in on it. Your dad know about this? 
 Once Jack finds out about how much money we're makin', he ain't gonna care how we made it. 
 I ran this game before, down in Florida-- it works. 
 Marie : Junior, don't forget-- the one on top is special for Paul's mom and dad. And, um, put these cookies on top, so they don't get crushed, okay? 
 Junior : Uh, you're not comin' with us? 
 Uh, no, I can't. 
 I got petitions to organize, and they have to be in by the end of the day. So, just, um, tell Frank and Iana I'm thinkin' about 'em, and I'll definitely come by tomorrow. 
 Hey, so, how come you never told me about your son? 
 Never came up. Wasn't a secret. 
 I had him when I was young. 
 Were you scared of him? 
 I'm not scared of anybody. 
 Was he like me? 
 Nobody's like you, June. I guess you both had some bad luck early on. Don't have much in common, besides that. 
 Get that engine warmed up, so she don't stall up on the hill! 
 And don't touch the radio. 
 Yes, sir. 
 He come to see you? 
 He didn't ask for anything. 
 Of course he didn't. He'll wait a few days 'til you offer it to him. If he had any love for ya, he'd leave ya alone. 
 [ Car engine starting ] 
 Hey. Um, our credit card machine is down. So, if, uh, you have cash, we can fill it for you now. Um, your co-pay is $200. 
 That's a nice racket you got goin' here. 
 Sir? 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 See ya soon. 
 
 
 
 I don't need checkin' up on. Why don't you head back to Brooklyn and tell 'em that for me? 
 Here for my annual flu shot. 
 Never seen her so happy to be here. 
 She's probably not anxious to face the girls, after last night. 
 Bill said there were witnesses. 
 It's all smoke. Nobody's come forward. 
 I guarantee it was a Lenape that ran that kid over. 
 I know how they feel about the police, but accusing her, that's disgusting. 
 I'll do 'em one better. I'll make sure that federal recognition bid ends up right in the toilet. 
 Evening. 
 What do you want? 
 I need to know where your son lives. 
 Junior lives with me. 
 No, your son, Phillip Kopus. 
 Why is it okay for you to show up at my house in the middle of the night? What's wrong with you? 
 I understand how you must feel. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, I am on your side. 
 Okay, I think we want the same-- 
 I doubt that. 
 Hey, ma'am-- ma'am? Ma'am? 
 You sure you're all right? You should probably see a doctor. 
 If you think you're gonna keep me quiet about the way your wife was actin', you're wasting your time. I'm still thinking about givin' a statement. 
 Okay. Well, I'm happy to put you in touch with the detective who's heading up the investigation. 
 But, if I'm not mistaken... you didn't actually see her hit anybody. And they're gonna wanna know why you took so long to come in. 
 You don't scare me. 
 I'm not trying to. 
 I'm just trying to keep you informed. 
 Please leave. 
 Funny-- I don't see Phillip up there. 
 Get out! Get out of my house! 
 What were you dreamin' about? 
 My wallet's on the dresser. There's no pills in the house. 
 [ Pills rattling ] I brought my own. 
 You're gonna need somethin' for the pain. 
 Open up. Open up. 
 Open up. Good boy. 
 Good boy-- swallow. [ Spitting ] 
 "Crooked Pharmacist OD's"... You like that headline? 
 Uh-uh. 
 So, you're gonna do exactly what I say? Good. 
 Here's what I say. Every Friday, I'm gonna send someone to your place. And every Friday, you're gonna give him 1,000 pills. 
 I'm only skimming half that. 
 Bullshit! You're skimming twice that, at least. And if you call the police... if you do anything but what I just said, I will come back and I will cut your head off while you sleep. You don't want that, do you? 
 [ Crying ] 
 [ Indistinct chatter on TV ] 
 Harold : - Hey. 
 Kate : - Hey. 
 She's sleeping. 
 Rachel : - Some kids at school are saying she hit that boy. 
 Lenape kids? 
 Yeah, their parents are going after your mother to get to me. They hate cops, okay? 
 Just ignore them. [ Text message alert ] 
 This is all gonna be over soon, okay? 
 Give me your phone. 
 What-- why? 
 What do you mean, "Why?" You know why. 
 Give me the phone or I'm gonna smash it into a million pieces! Give me the-- 
 Hey, hey! Rachel! 
 You okay, dad? 
 Phillip : Have some fries. 
 Let's get a few things clear. 
 Has anybody come in to make an official statement yet? 
 Long as we have an understanding, nobody ever will. 
 What do you want from me? 
 You're gonna have to take it as it comes. 
 Well, you want me to... look the other way? 
 While you do what, exactly? 
 You don't get to know that. 
 You're sacrificing for your wife, Harold. 
 Sacrifice hurts. 
 You try contacting my wife, or any member of my family-- 
 I don't have the slightest interest in your family. 
 So, where'd you find my gun the other night? 
 Jean gave it to me. 
 Well, I got it back now, don't I? 
 [ Distant laughter ] 
 You think Jean did it, don't you? 
 Wait... nah, you know she did. I can see it. 
 I didn't think so, at first. But I guess, after marrying you, havin' those kids, she's changed. 
 She's innocent. 
 You're gonna have to get better at that. 
 At what? 
 Lying. She's guilty. 
 You wouldn't be sittin' here, if she wasn't. 
 I gotta tell ya... has me feeling a little torn, because I knew that kid that got hit. 
 No. You don't feel sh1t. 
 You don't care about anybody. You need somethin'. 
 That's all. And you don't care how you get it. 
 I could say the same about you. 
 Phillip : Frank. 
 Frank Morgan : - Hey, Mike. 
 Mike : - Hey, Frank. 
 Hey, I need you to help me out with somethin'. 
 Yeah, whatever you need. 
 I wanna get a look at that lady's car, all right? 
 I drove by there. I'm pretty sure they got it in the garage. 
 Oh, all right. 
 You wanna go? 
 That lady's husband's a cop. 
 I don't think gettin' locked up's gonna help your son, Frank. 
 My son-- my son might die, and that lady's gonna get off scot-free? 
 Jesus, you changed, man. So, you gonna help me or what? 
 I'm sorry, man. I can't be messin' with the cops, bro. 
 I'll find somebody else, then! 
 Walpole Police Station. 
 Uh, can you connect me with Officer Harold Jensen, please? 
 Who can I say is calling? 
 Yeah, it's a friend. 
 [ Chuckling ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Rachel : - If you get caught inside the school, is it a big deal? 
 Junior : So, why haven't you been texting me back? 
 Oh, my father took my phone. 
 What? 
 I've been texting your dad all day? 
 [ Laughing ] 
 Oh, I hate the world! 
 I don't care about anything but you. 
 I wanna do it. 
 Are you sure? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 [ Tires squealing ] Come on-- go, go! 
 Harold : What the hell are you doin'? 
 Don't you touch me. Don't you touch me. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 Okay, who are you? 
 What's your name? 
 Frank Morgan. 
 Kate : - Dad? 
 Katie, get inside. 
 Get in the house, now! Go. 
 I'm not movin'. I'm in the right. 
 I wanna see the car. 
 You wanna see it? 
 [ Garage door opening ] Here. 
 You satisfied? 
 I catch you anywhere near my house again, you better believe I'm taking you in. 
 You're goin' to hell. So is your wife. 
 Come on, baby. Come here, come here, come here. 
 I'm sorry. It's okay-- it's okay. 
 I got this, okay? He's just confused right now. 
 He's upset. Everything's under control, okay? I need you to believe that. 
 All right? You need to stay strong for your mother. I-- Just don't be walkin' home alone right now, on your own, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Can you do that for me? 
 Okay, I got this, though. Okay, everything's okay. 
 I need you to know that, all right? 
 'Kay. 
 Yeah, I got ya. 
 Now, come on, let's, um... let's go upstairs. 
 Sylvia : You want tea? 
 Can you find me? 
 Irv, yes. 
 Jean : - Rachel? 
 Really? 
 Yes-- No, I just wanna-- ow-how'd it go? 
 Well, how bad was it? I don't know why she said that. 
 No. No, no, she's here. 
 Y-yes. All I wanna know is, how you're gonna fix it. 
 I'm waiting for you. 
 Irv, I'll, uh, I'll get, uh, back to you. 
 Do you know where I am? 
 Jean? 
 Come back downstairs. Jean? 
 Jean? Jean, open the door! 
 David. 
 David. 
 Mommy, open the window. 
 Help me. 
 Come outside. 
 [ Birds squawking ] You won't fall. 
 You won't fall-- I promise. 
 You won't fall-- I promise. 
 Jeanie, Jeanie! 
 Sweetie, sweetie. Come here. 
 Honey? Honey, you have to be careful. 
 You have to be careful. Are you all right? 
 Dr. Beilke : Your father-in-law agreed to pay out of pocket. 
 So, you should say goodbye. You're gonna upset her if you prolong things. All right, she'll be safe here. 
 Harold : They're kicking me out. 
 So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna come back first thing in the morning, before work. We can have breakfast together, okay? Hey. 
 Jean : Can't you just take me home? 
 Well, you're not gonna get better at home. 
 There is no better. This is me. 
 This is the only me there is. I don't wanna be away from the girls. 
 [ Harold sighs ] 
 I don't belong here. 
 I know you don't. 
 I know you don't. But it's gonna be for a little while. It's not gonna be long. 
 You promised me you wouldn't leave me. 
 I'm not leaving you. 
 Yes, you are. 
 I'm not leaving you. 
 You are leaving me, because you're gonna go home, and I'm just gonna be gone, and the girls are gonna hate me. 
 No, they're not. 
 They love you. Okay, I love you. 
 Then, why is this happening? 
 I'm sorry-- I'm sorry. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Crickets chirping ] 
 Phillip : I wanted to see my old alma mater. 
 A lot smaller than I remember. 
 I got in my first big fight over there. 
 The fights were bigger than the games. 
 [ Sighs ] You know, I knew this kid who went here. I used to love gettin' him stoned, just to hear the crazy sh1t he'd say. 
 [ Chuckling ] 
 During the games, he used to sit on the visiting side, cheer his ass off for 'em. 
 He'd get beat up every week during football season. 
 Couldn't fight to save his life. 
 He was probably the toughest guy I ever met, though. 
 I used to love fightin' for him. 
 So, how long you been seein' her-- cop's daughter? 
 Junior : - A couple months. 
 You guys havin' fun yet? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know? 
 How do you not know? You forget? 
 You have blackouts? [ Chuckling ] 
 No. 
 That's what I thought. 
 What are you bein' all shy about? 
 You should be shoutin' that from the mountain tops. 
 I like her. I don't talk about her like that. 
 That's good. 
 Good man. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 [ Car engine starting ] 
 [ Tires squealing ] 
 [ Grunting ] 
 I told you I don't need checkin' up on. 
 Ah! 
 Wanna get some drive-thru?
