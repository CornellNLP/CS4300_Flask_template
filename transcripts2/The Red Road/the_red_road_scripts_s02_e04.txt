 [ Gunshot ] 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 Where did you get this? 
 Oh, I stole it out of my dad's closet. 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 For when it gets cold out. 
 What did you say? 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Yes, you did. [ Chuckles ] 
 Watch. I'm gonna make a smiley face. 
 That's an eye. 
 That's another eye. 
 Now I'm gonna make him smile. 
 Man : Whoa, oh! Hey! 
 What are you doing?! 
 Hey, this is sovereign land. You're trespassing. 
 Hey. 
 You a-- you a member of the Lenape Tribe? 
 Yeah, y-your Chief knows we're here. 
 We got permission. 
 Permission for what? 
 We're just surveying the area for construction. 
 For your casino? 
 No, you're not. 
 What's-- what's going on? 
 Hey, uh... 
 Look, you guys just better clear out of here. 
 If you don't, I swear I'll start shooting. 
 Look, you, uh-- you should go talk to your Chief, kid. 
 I meant what I said. Get off my land. 
 [ Vehicle approaches ] 
 [ Car door opens ] 
 Phillip : Who are you? 
 Chief Levi Gall of the Algonquian Tribe. 
 I run the Wolf's Head Casino Resort in Connecticut. 
 Never been. 
 We're partnering with your tribe for a new casino. 
 We're gonna build it right here on the mountain. 
 Is this house in your way? 
 You want to pay me to move? 
 I might consider, but I paid good money for it, so-- 
 Oh, we got a site staked out just about a mile from here. 
 Actually, I'm looking for my son. 
 Was told you might know where he is. 
 Junior Van Der Veen? 
 No sh1t? 
 Thought he was an orphan. 
 Kind of late to the game, aren't you? Kid's 17. 
 Well, your former Chief didn't like me much. 
 Made it hard for me to see him. 
 One man standing in your way? 
 If it was my son, I'd find a way around him. 
 You have children. 
 Not that I know of. [ Chuckles ] 
 Oh. Can you help me find Junior? 
 I'm busy. 
 I'll pay you. 
 I bet you would. 
 You're a confident man, but not too smart. 
 Well, I just wasted two minutes talking to you, so maybe you're right. 
 I employ a lot of guys just like you-- easy to come by and easy to lose. 
 I'm starting to understand why Mac didn't like you. 
 Maybe this house is in my way after all. 
 [ Indistinct conversation ] 
 I'm telling you-- 
 [ Door slams ] 
 Hey, look who returned from the woods. 
 What the hell did you do? 
 Can't talk to your mother like that. 
 I'll talk to her however I want to. 
 Maybe you two should get going. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 I wanted to tell you. 
 But you're not so easy to find these days. 
 You can't let them build casinos here. 
 This wasn't easy for me, Jun. 
 This was the hardest thing I had to do, but I think I did right. 
 We need money. 
 And we're always gonna need money. 
 No. Not after this. 
 No one here's gonna want for anything. 
 They're erasing us. 
 Mac told me that's what this is. 
 We give up this land, and we're done. 
 We're not giving it up. 
 That's what they want you to think. 
 You're well aware that half the tribe is dying of cancer. 
 This is the only way we can get them the help they need. 
 I'm Chief now. 
 I have to do what's right for everyone. 
 Except for your family. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Oh, and I'd love a cup of coffee, but not out of one of those trendy little capsule things. 
 I'd like a cup of regular brewed coffee. 
 That still exists, right? 
 Yes. 
 This is a police station, for Christ's sake. 
 [ Chuckles ] Jensen. 
 You wanted to see me, Mayor? 
 Yes. Wanted to talk to you about the shooting. 
 All right, look, I realize I wasn't on active duty. 
 I shouldn't have been out patrolling, but I just want to say I think this department has got its priorities way out of whack, and I didn't sign up for sitting around while the Lenape have to fend for them-- 
 Jensen. Relax. 
 Have a seat. 
 Ballistics report is in on the guy you shot. 
 Turns out his gun is an exact match for the one that killed the Chief. 
 What? 
 Fine work. 
 To my thinking, this puts us in a best-case scenario. 
 An outsider killed the Chief. 
 Helps us avoid a lot of potential tribal/town chaos. 
 Listen, this is awkward for everyone, but you were on a short list for when Captain Warren retired at the end of this year. 
 And we all know those plans have changed. 
 Oh, hell. You're Captain. Congratulations. 
 Man : Well deserved, Captain. 
 Okay. 
 Jensen, the way you handled that made my job a whole lot easier... so please continue to do that in the future, and you and I are gonna get along just fine. 
 Mayor? 
 Yes, Captain. 
 Well, I was hoping we could discuss our policy regarding distress calls from the Tribal Police. 
 Looking forward to it. 
 [ Dog barking in distance ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Edna : Captain? 
 [ Thud ] 
 Uh, I'm so sorry. 
 Uh, the Captain left this on my desk for you. 
 Phylis was covering for me while I was out, and, uh, she should have given that to you. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Uh, uh, Edna? 
 Yeah? 
 Hey. 
 Can you get me Warden Carrington at NJCI? 
 Sure. 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 [ Sighs ] Yeah, this is Lieutenant-- uh, Captain... Jensen of the Walpole Police Department. 
 Is the Warden available? 
 Woman : One moment, Captain. 
 Carrington : This is Warden Carrington. 
 Yeah, I, um-- y-you don't know me. 
 This is Harold Jensen. 
 Did Bill Warren happen to give you a message for me? 
 Oh, yeah. What a shock, huh? 
 Yeah. Yeah, it was. 
 Well, look, if you want to come by today, I can arrange a visit for you. 
 Uh, a visit with who? 
 One of our inmates. 
 Bill said you'd want to talk to him off the record. 
 Look, I'm, uh-- I'm sorry. 
 Who-- who are we talking about? 
 Cop killer. Name's Kopus. 
 What? 
 Jack Kopus-- our star attraction. 
 I know you? 
 No. 
 Huh. 
 I'm the Captain of the Walpole Police Department. 
 Unh-unh-unh-unh, last I checked, Bill Warren was the Captain of the Walpole Police Department. Come on. 
 How do you know the Captain? 
 [ Scoffs ] Where is he? 
 You got my 20 grand? 
 That's what I told him it'd cost for me to keep my mouth shut. 
 b*st*rd tried to play it off like he didn't care. 
 I'm glad to see he has come to his senses. 
 What are you gonna do with 20 grand in here? 
 Spend it. Money will buy you a lot in here. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I got seven bucks. 
 I'll give you two. 
 [ Chuckles ] That's all right. 
 You cops don't make all that much. 
 That's why you're all so pissed off. [ Chuckles ] 
 And you can stop trying to blackmail him. He's dead. 
 He shot himself. 
 Shot himself? What a pussy. 
 What did you have on him? 
 You want to know? 
 Mm-hmm. I do. 
 20 grand. 
 You're not gonna get anything from me. 
 All right. Forget the 20 grand, then. 
 But I'm not giving it away for nothing. 
 I want pictures for my wall-- photos, old ones. 
 I need to look at something. Do you understand? 
 Well, how do I know it'll be worth the trouble? 
 It was worth him eating a bullet for. 
 No, his wife died. It had nothing to do with whatever you're talking about. 
 Wasn't his wife. He was part of something. Not just him, either. 
 This something to do with the water? 
 I'm not telling you unless you bring me some photos of my boy and my wife. 
 I need to prove that was real. 
 My mind's getting tricky. 
 Starting to feel like I was born in this place. 
 You've only been here a year. 
 Every day, my shadow declineth, and I'm withered like grass. 
 That's great. You a priest? 
 More or less. 
 Now, look, there's this one picture I remember of Phillip. 
 He's about 6 years old. He's holding his trophy. 
 Don't remember what for. I got to have that one. 
 D-- Oh, do you know my son? 
 Well-- well, if you don't, let me tell you something. 
 He's a strange creation, and I made him. 
 I'm Dr. Frankenstein. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Come on, man. 
 Just bring me some pictures. That's all I want. 
 Pictures? 
 Yeah. 
 If I get them for you and you don't have anything, I'm gonna ask the Warden to transfer you into General Population. 
 I hear you got a lot of old friends there who want to catch up with you. 
 I'm not worried. 
 What I got is real. You'll see. 
 Just bring me my family, and you'll know why he did it. 
 But you ain't gonna like it. 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 Hey. 
 I don't know what I'm gonna wear to the PBA dance. 
 I don't have any nice clothes. 
 It's been so long since I've been out. 
 They all look old. 
 Well, you look nice in that one. 
 Well, you wouldn't tell me if I didn't. 
 I need Rachel. 
 I think I spilled vodka cranberry on that one. 
 Do you remember? 
 Hmm. 
 Do you still see a stain? 
 Nope. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You happy? 
 [ Chuckles ] It's okay. 
 No. 
 No, I mean you. 
 [ Zipper closes ] 
 You seem happy. 
 I do? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Oh. [ Knocks on dresser ] 
 Two days, no symptoms. 
 It's a little scary, actually. 
 [ Chuckles ] That's amazing. 
 Yeah, I guess we both have something to be happy about. 
 Yeah. 
 I know it's not how you wanted it, but you're Captain. 
 You worked your ass off for this. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Everything's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Grandma, you remember Phillip, don't you? 
 How you doing? You mind if I see that? 
 I don't see my name in there. 
 I never said you did it. 
 No, but you thought it. 
 I don't believe you're privy to my thoughts. 
 Can I talk to you for a minute? 
 Your mama send you? 
 I just wanted to stop by and see, uh, if you knew anything about this Levi guy. 
 I know you represent a lot of tribes, so... 
 I know him a little bit. Not 'cause of that. 
 He met with Mac a few times. 
 Tried to pressure him to partner on a casino. 
 Is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 I heard he used to be an activist back in the '70s. 
 Now he's just a greedy asshole. 
 So, I'm organizing people who don't want the casino on the mountain. 
 I moved back here full time. 
 I realized I couldn't pull this place back from the brink if I'm living in Brooklyn. 
 We're gonna try and have your mother impeached, so you need to convince her to step down. 
 I'd rather this not get ugly. 
 I ain't helping you go after my mother. 
 You want a casino here? 
 I don't really give a sh1t. 
 [ Scoffs ] You know, for a minute there, I thought you moving back might mean we could... get to know each other a little better. 
 I appreciate what you did for me. 
 But you're a drug dealer and I don't know what else. 
 I grew up around all that. 
 I'm not looking to get back to it. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 So, who you trying to get made Chief this time? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You want something done right... 
 Oh, I couldn't agree more. 
 Only what I think you're doing is kind of wrong. 
 I don't think you're qualified to judge. 
 Yeah, that makes two of us. 
 Aschell : Answer some basic questions, I'll go easy on you on the report, okay? 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 Don't worry, Captain. 
 We're protecting the Little Prince's rights. 
 I got a lawyer here for him. I called his mother. 
 I even offered him a soda. 
 What happened? 
 I pulled him over driving a stolen survey truck through downtown Walpole. 
 Okay, well, let me know when his mother gets here. 
 I want to talk to her. 
 Uh, gentlemen? 
 Levi Gall, and this is my attorney, Donald Baker. 
 I'm the owner of the survey truck in question and Junior's father. 
 This is all my fault. 
 I told Junior he could drive the truck. 
 It's not stolen. 
 That true? 
 Yeah. 
 You shouldn't have got me out. 
 I'm just gonna do it again. I don't want a casino down here. 
 And why's that? 
 It's not right. 
 It's a sacred place. It should be respected. 
 God, I love hearing you talk like that. 
 That's passion. 
 It's what's right. 
 It's a complicated thing. 
 You led the occupation of the BIA headquarters. 
 A Federal Marshal shot you. 
 That's right. 
 Now you run casinos? 
 I don't understand how you could just turn your back on everything. 
 But I realized that without the money and the power that comes with it, we'll never survive. 
 Uh, listen. 
 You growing up down here-- you don't know the whole story. 
 You should come up to Connecticut where you were born, where your ancestors are, learn about the Algonquian. 
 Tell you what. You come up, I'll show you everything we have up there-- what the casinos have given us-- and then we'll talk. 
 
 
 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm here to see your husband. 
 About what? 
 Police business. 
 He's not here. 
 You know he's not here. 
 His truck isn't in the driveway. 
 I know. I did notice that. 
 But, you know, drove all the way down here, so... figured at least I'd check and make sure. 
 You're really here to see Harold? 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 Yeah. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Sorry. I lost your number. 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. He just got here. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 You can't come here. 
 Settle down, Captain. 
 I just solved a case for the FBI. 
 Since I don't know any FBI agents, I figured I might as well tell you. 
 I think that Indian that you shot was from a tribe in Connecticut. 
 Their Chief was trying real hard to get Mac to build a casino with him. 
 Now that he's gone, guess what's happening. 
 You mean Junior's dad? I just met him. 
 Junior was arrested for stealing one of his trucks. 
 He came and picked him up, didn't press charges. 
 And the guy I shot didn't have any ID on him, and his fingerprints aren't in the system. 
 The FBI's calling it a robbery gone bad, so do you have any evidence? 
 What I just told you is evidence, if you're not an idiot. 
 All right, I'll let the feds know, see if they can trace the gunman to this guy's tribe. 
 All right, well, don't look so put out. 
 I just gave you a present. 
 Just stay away from my wife, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Hey, we're not square yet. 
 I need to ask you for something. 
 What are you doing? 
 Just... taking some photos. 
 For what? 
 Just to look at. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Your football trophy. I still have that. 
 You and Mikey. Hmm. 
 I met Junior's dad. 
 He's looking for him, you know? 
 I know. 
 Junior's almost 18. 
 I can't keep him from his father anymore. 
 Um, why are you trying to get into business with him when you don't want Junior to talk to him? 
 Is he, uh, threatening you or something? 
 No. 
 He's, uh... 
 He's just someone I know can get the job done. 
 I'm not in the position to pick my allies, Phillip. 
 This is the guy, isn't it? 
 He's the guy you ran off to be with when you left me with goddamn Jack. 
 I left to be part of the Movement. 
 I was fed up with the way our people were being treated. 
 I honestly thought you would be okay. 
 Look, I'm sorry that I didn't believe you, all right? 
 You gonna kick my ass now? 
 That stuff makes you paranoid, huh? 
 You can have it if you want. 
 Where did you get it? 
 I don't know. 
 Did your old man give it to you? 
 [ Chuckles ] Yeah. 
 Yeah, I was thinking about going up there, maybe. 
 See what else I can get out of him. 
 I was gonna head into town, pick some things up. 
 Want to come along? 
 Sure. 
 Junior : I thought you said that you were gonna take off after your parole was up. 
 Why are you buying stuff for the house? 
 You know, if you're not gonna move back in with mom, I think you should stay here. 
 There's a lot of room. It's not bad. 
 It's a little haunted, but not bad. 
 Look who it is. 
 You got my pictures? 
 You got to give us a hand first. 
 [ Strained ] What good is a refrigerator if you don't have electricity? 
 Oh, I got a generator. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Ah. 
 Fits perfect. 
 That's a damn nice refrigerator you got there. 
 Nicer than mine. 
 Must have cost you. 
 It was on sale. 
 Hold on a second. I'll go get the pictures. 
 You sure you want to be hanging around with him? 
 It didn't work out so well for you last time. 
 Now we're square. 
 Where  did  you get the money to buy this stuff? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Mm. 
 I was a white man living among Indians. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 They go away unless you start talking. 
 Huh? 
 Okay. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Okay. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 Captain Warren... 
 Um, y-you remember when the auto plant in Walpole was going under? 
 What was it, about 25, 30 years ago? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Um... They needed a cheap way to get-- to get rid of their paint sludge. 
 The Marchetti family had a big waste contract back then, so they started hauling it up the mountain and putting it in the iron mines. 
 Paid Warren and a couple other cops. 
 [ Whistles ] Looked the other way. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 And how is it you know this? 
 I drove one of the trucks. 
 You'd drive up there at night with a couple tons of paint sludge-- 
 Burmese blue, racetrack red-- and you'd pump it into the mine shaft. 
 I did it for almost four years. 
 Yeah. 
 Which mine shaft? 
 All of them. Whole mountain. 
 Almost 60,000 tons, if I can recall. 
 I go home with coughing, feeling like crap. 
 Started coughing up blood after a while, so I stopped, but they kept going with it. 
 So... they didn't dump it on the surface? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 It's under the ground. 
 All the mine shafts? 
 Every one. 
 The only reason they stopped was they run out of room. 
 They filled up the whole damn mountain. 
 [ Chuckles ] So, yeah. 
 It's probably in the water. 
 It's probably in, uh, everything. 
 I had myself a life once. 
 He said he killed his wife. 
 He-- he wasn't talking about Walpole, was he? 
 What? 
 The water-- he didn't mean the water in Walpole? 
 I don't know.

 Well, let's not make a big deal out of it, okay? 
 I don't want to put too much pressure on her. 
 No big deal, Harold. 
 I'm just happy for my daughter.

 The Captain said something to me. 
 I wanted to... ask you about it. 
 Okay. 
 He said that the mob had a big waste contract with the city back in the early '90s. 
 [ Chuckling ] The mob? I don't think so. 
 He said they pumped the auto plant's paint sludge into the iron mines. 
 Those iron mines were sealed up in the '50s. 
 Well, maybe somebody unsealed them. 
 I mean, they're all over the mountain. 
 It would explain why everybody up there is getting cancer. 
 I never heard anything like that. 
 Well, I've seen sludge all over the place up there. 
 I've seen it in places you can't even drive to, so where's it coming from?

 He said something to Jean, too. 
 He told her that he killed Dorothy. 
 You mean that's what she thinks he said. 
 No. She's sure. 
 My daughter's not capable of being sure, Harold. 
 Did the Captain think he had something to do with Dorothy getting sick? 
 Listen, Bill said a lot of strange things to me, too, but the man was half out of his mind with grief.

 Are you okay? 
 Hey, are you all right in there? 
 Do you need me to get someone? 
 Oh, my God. Rachel. 
 [ Gasps ] Oh, my God! Help! 
 Help me! 
 [ Crying ] It's okay, honey. 
 Are you on any prescribed medication? 
 Have you taken any drugs? 
 They're gonna run a blood test at the hospital anyway, so-- 
 I took some pills. 
 Rachel. 
 What is she talking about? 
 What pills did you take, Rachel? 
 [ Crying ] My mother's. 
 Antipsychotics. 
 I'm on-- I'm... I'm a schizophrenic. 
 [ Insects chirping ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hey. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 How you feeling, baby? 
 Okay. 
 Honey, medicine is for sick people. 
 You're not sick. 
 I need to keep taking them. 
 I need to stop it from happening. 
 Well, you can talk to somebody. 
 You don't need pills. 
 What's there to talk about? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 All I want to do is be with Junior. 
 But I-- Now I know I can't. 
 After watching what you put dad through, I can't. 
 I read the things you wrote. 
 You can't let that happen to me.

 Junior : I followed you last night. 
 You desecrated a scared site, you son of a bitch. 
 So you could hide some money? 
 What the hell is wrong with you?! Why would you do that?! 
 I'm not here to defend myself, Junior. 
 Then why are you here? 
 I found that money next to Mac's body. 
 Your father was trying to bribe him. 
 You understand? He's the reason Mac's dead. 
 Mac was standing in the way of a casino and you, and now Levi's got both. 
 And those two assholes were working for him. 
 Harold's telling the feds. 
 And they're gonna take him down for it. 
 And I know you're done with me. I know that. 
 And you should be. 
 Just stay away from him. 
 Promise me. 
 I'm not leaving until you promise me. 
 All right. I won't see him anymore. 
 Now leave me the hell alone. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 [ Baby babbling ] 
 Come on, sweetie. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 There we are. 
 I got you. 
 I got you. 
 Sir. 
 It's all right. 
 You travel light, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 I got you something to celebrate your homecoming. 
 What's that? 
 It's yours. 
 Come on. I'll ride with you. 
 It's got a police scanner in it. 
 We can race these guys up on the highway. 
 We got plenty of guns up in Connecticut. 
 Does that one still even shoot? 
 Yeah, it still shoots. 
 All right. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Let's go.
