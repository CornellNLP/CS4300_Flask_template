 Previously on "Shut Eye"... 
 You ever use, um... scopolamine? 
 What is that, like mouthwash? 
 It's a hypnotic drug. 
 I blow it in your face, you empty your bank account. 
 Don't remember you did it. It's amazing stuff, really. 
 You just got to be careful. 
 The Drums. 
 I f*cking love The Drums. 
 Yeah? 
 There's this girl at my school, and... and I kind of like her. 
 Like, a lot. 
 I got something for you. 
 You found something. 
 Nadine Davies does not have kids. 
 No. 
 Then why is she shopping at toy stores, going to Little League fields, and taking school tours? 
 That is so sad. 
 Tragic. 
 Potentially. 
 Everything has to be in its right place. 
 Look around. 
 Anything look like it might scare Nadine off? 
 You're fine. 
 Mm. 
 These crystals. We're gonna move those. 
 A little too New Age-y. 
 That doesn't feel right. 
 Don't push. 
 I know. 
 Vicki's doing the research. She's on her way. 
 You got the money? 
 Mmhmm. 
 [Raps table, sighs] Look, I know what I'm doing. 
 If the husband comes home, we risk losing her, and I don't know how long I can hold on to her. 
 The drawer for this, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 Two weeks' worth of pickups. 
 This is an investment in our future. 
 It's worth it. 
 [Knock on door] 
 It's ready. Come check it out. 
 Hey! 
 Ha ha! 
 Ah, Nick's gonna love this. 
 Yeah. 
 And if he doesn't, let me know. 
 I got a half a dozen folks will give you more than what you can get on eBay. 
 Yeah, we're gonna need a new sign. 
 You want to go with another classic neon. 
 The new LEDs are cheaper and more reliable, but, to me, they just don't say "psychic." 
 Just get us something we can put in the window. 
 I'm on it. 
 And, uh, let me know what Nick says about this beauty. 
 Maybe an open palm, some stars, and a moon? 
 Yeah, sounds good. 
 sh1t! 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 [Sighs] Excuse me. 
 The whole bottle? 
 I can save 'em. 
 The whole bottle? 
 I can save 'em. 
 I'll call Dr. Pearlman. 
 Just be more careful, honey. 
 This won't go on the insurance. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be sorry. 
 Be careful. 
 Go look in your bedroom. 
 All right. 
 I f*ckin' love you, dude. 
 That is so awesome.

 Hey, Dad. 
 That Gandalf thing is so sick. 
 Uh, it's supposed to be Merlin, Nick. 
 Oh, well same difference. Deep wizard sh1t. 
 Nick. 
 I'm late for school. 
 Yeah, I'll take you. We need to talk. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 I'm sorry to be so early, but there wasn't any traffic. 
 Actually, I'm always early. 
 That's all right. Come on in. 
 Nadine Davies, this is my daughter, Vicki. 
 Yeah, I introduced myself. Um, if I could just talk to you for five minutes before I go to work... 
 Oh, of course. As, I said, I'm always early. 
 Hey, what's up? I'm just gonna catch the bus. 
 Okay. 
 We'll talk when you get home. 
 Would you mind if I talk to my daughter for 10 minutes or so? 
 My children... I always indulge them. 
 I think that's lovely. 
 Nadine, come in. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Let me get you a cup of coffee or some tea? 
 Ah, great. 
 That's quite a setup. 
 Charlie's not a snob about most things, but when it comes to coffee, God help me, he is a nightmare. 
 Well, I have nothing against a good cup of coffee. 
 How old's your daughter? 
 She's Charlie's daughter from his first marriage. 
 Afraid I'm the other woman. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 It's... It's healing fine. No damage. 
 Well, not that. You just seem... 
 I'm good. Let's go, let's go. 
 Okay, well, this is what I got so far. 
 You want more, I can "drone" her backyard. 
 Drone? 
 Yeah, it's no big thing. 
 Uh, bank accounts... joint with her husband. 
 Investment portfolio... impressive, well-managed. 
 And then there's this one Citibank account. 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 [Whispering] Um, she opened it 33 years ago, put $50,000 a year in for the next 12 years. 
 Since then, it remained untouched, accruing away... $1,773, 480.18 as of last quarter. 
 You smelled it. 
 She had a kid when she was 17. 
 Put him up for adoption. 
 And her search history? 
 Been lookin' at a lot of middle schools. 
 For a kid who's 30? 
 Bingo. 
 See, here she is sitting quietly, listening to people talk in a survivor-guilt chat room. 
 So, I come in, talk about a kid I had that I put up for adoption and found out he died and I was devastated. 
 And there she is. 
 He died when he was 13? 
 12. 
 You want to see a picture? 
 You get a name? 
 I got two. 
 You know why Charlie wanted to see me? 
 Oh, when it comes to the business, it is all him. 
 I mean, like I said when we first met, I'm really just a housewife. 
 Mm. 
 Linda giving you Dad's coffee rap? 
 Water just below boiling, coffee weighed. 
 Hey. 
 I like a ritual. 
 And I like good coffee. 
 Any left? 
 Yeah, I'll make you a cup. 
 Do you want to come into the office? 
 You can bring your coffee if you like. 
 Would it be insulting to ask for sugar? 
 Ooh. 
 A little bit. 
 But I'm handling it. 
 All I ask is that you try it first, and then, if you still want to sweeten it up... 
 I don't want to be disturbed under any circumstances. 
 I hope you weren't expecting a crystal ball or anything like that. 
 Tell you the truth, I don't know what I was expecting. 
 I do use tarot cards from time to time, not because I honestly believe that the order in which you turn over the cards can reveal anything about your future or your spiritual life, because I do believe that they can be powerful symbols in unlocking certain characteristics in both participants in a reading. 
 Is what this is going to be, a reading? I mean, I thought... 
 Well, you called and said it was important, and, well, I imagined it was about the Gypsies. 
 That's for you. It's $5,000. 
 I don't understand. 
 Well, I told you I knew a cop. 
 The Roma... They tend to have big, extended families. 
 He dug something up... well, a few things about your psychic's cousins and what they were involved in. 
 Guys drive around supermarkets telling people they can repair the dents in their cars. 
 Sometimes they steal their money, and sometimes they steal their cars. 
 Anyway, we convinced her to take $15,000 and go back to Ohio with her cousins and never come back. 
 You're never gonna be bothered again. 
 I-I can't thank you enough. 
 It was my pleasure, believe me. 
 You know, I'm sorry that someone as obviously open and curious as you are had the experience you had. 
 Sorry. Oop. 
 I'm actually, as a rule, not all that gullible. 
 But you don't seem to automatically expect the worst in others. 
 Uh, that sounds like a line from a reading. 
 That is a Barnum statement. 
 It's a broad statement that can be true of anybody. 
 Thanks. 
 It's a popular tool in mentalism, that sort of magic. 
 Linda said that you were a magician. 
 How did you, um, switch teams? 
 Oh, that's a bit of a story. 
 I'm curious. 
 My dad died when I was five. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 For me, it was what it was. 
 But it broke my mother's heart. 
 She visited a-a woman who claimed to be a psychic. 
 She told her my father was nearby, trying to warn her that she was in danger, and she was in danger, all right. 
 The psychic took her for everything... all her savings, the deed to our trailer. 
 I mean, we lived on the street for almost a year. 
 That's terrible. 
 Oh, it got worse. 
 She dove headfirst into a vodka bottle and never came out. 
 I was 14, and my sister was 10 when she died. 
 So, Dad said to mention, in case it comes up, he's going with the, uh... the "trailer park/bad psychic" story, not the one where his mom has lymphoma. 
 Yeah, I-I figured. 
 Trailer park's a little more real. 
 You ever notice how, in both stories, Grandpa dies? 
 I think that's called wish fulfillment. 
 Did you want more? I can make more. 
 No, I got to go to work. 
 Can't start doggin' it until they realize I'm invaluable. 
 Good luck with that. [Both chuckle] 
 Linda told me that you actually were, well, psychic. 
 Sometimes, I have intuitions that are helpful. 
 Sometimes, the cards can be helpful. 
 But I don't know. 
 I mean, maybe it's just a question of focus. 
 You must be the world's most self-deprecating psychic. 
 Well, I'm just glad that you're safe, Nadine, and that we were able to get you some of your money back. 
 Uh, the other day, when you were at my house, you stopped and said that you had, um... a feeling. Was that this intuition? 
 Just for a moment, I-I felt a presence. 
 It could've been that, or maybe it's just the situation you're in with the Gypsies. 
 There's that self-deprecation. 
 Could you... 
 Do you think that you could, um... find it again? 
 Find it? 
 The presence you felt. 
 I mean, you said sometimes the cards... 
 Oh. 
 You want me to give you a reading. 
 Well, no surprise here. 
 This card represents strife, competition, feeling beat up, under attack... you know, like when someone pulls down a tree and leaves a rooster with a crown on its head in your bedroom to scare you. 
 Mm. 
 The three of cups. 
 Abundant life, long term, surrounded by good food and wine, good friends. 
 Sometimes, as I said, the tarot just tells us what we already know. 
 I'm actually more of a beer person. 
 To be honest, so am I. 
 When these things were made, they were probably talking mead. 
 Mm. 
 What? 
 This, uh... 
 This is the cheaters card. 
 Someone is taking something, being sneaky, unfaithful, acting without integrity. 
 Your husband's business trips... 
 Didn't take a psychic. 
 Well, as I said, sometimes the cards just tell you what you already know. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Surprise. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I got you something. Charlie's not home? 
 Charlie's with a client. He's not to be disturbed. 
 One time, in high school, I went home with this guy. 
 I mean, he took me to his place. It was his parents' place. 
 They were out of town. 
 So, we're doing it in his parents' bedroom. 
 I mean, we're trying. He's a kid. 
 You know how boys get. 
 So I whisper in his ear, "This is your parents' bed. We're doing it in your parents' bed." 
 He gets rock hard, and we f*ck for hours. 
 Sometimes, if there was a lull, I just had to remind him where we were. 
 Good to know. 
 Take me to your room. 
 You said he's with a client. 
 You may find this hard to believe... 
 I have boundaries. You just crossed one. 
 It'd be hot. 
 No doubt. 
 You said you had something for me? 
 Scopolamine. 
 That drug I told you about. 
 I think it could be really helpful in your work. 
 You're a pushy person. 
 Anyone ever tell you that? 
 Who, me? 
 I'm all sweetness, all the time. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Try that on one of your "valued customers." 
 It works. 
 Maybe you'll realize how invaluable I can be. 
 Oh, and I would divvy it up if I were you. 
 Like I said, too much... not a good thing. 
 You said you wanted to go to my room? 
 Yeah. You changing your mind? 
 Well, I was just wondering. 
 You've got this stuff, you know how well it works. 
 Why not just dose me? 
 We'd be in there right now, under my sheets. 
 The thought crossed my mind. 
 Seriously, it did. 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's gonna sound like a Hallmark card, but... 
 I wanted it to mean something. 
 Try that sh1t out on someone. 
 It's f*cking amazing. 
 And come see me... soon. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Excuse me, ma'am. I think these are yours. 
 Charlie said you like my car, so you know what? 
 It's yours. 
 Eduardo, I don't... I mean... 
 You have no idea how easy it is for me to do this and how much Charlie has helped my family and me. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm just a little tired. 
 Nothing a new car can't fix. 
 [Laughs] I mean... 
 This is unbelievable. 
 Drive it around the block. You'll believe it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Where's my boy? I want him to see this. 
 Oh, he's with a client. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Let me see if I can interrupt. 
 No, no. If, uh... 
 If he's helping someone, God bless him. 
 How's he doing? 
 You know, his head... everything else? 
 He's good. 
 Okay. 
 He's fine actually. 
 All right, well, you let me know what he says when he comes out and sees this puppy. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Look, all you got to say is, "You're welcome." The thank you is all me. 
 Oh, uh... don't get pulled over. 
 The pink slip, chain of title... questionable at best. 
 Oh. Uh... 
 This is a serious card. 
 What does that mean? 
 Uh, this card speaks of willing victimhood to something that you're not looking at. 
 To be honest, I-I don't see this card often, and it worries me a little. 
 Worries you? 
 Well, you seem to have come to terms with your husband's infidelity. 
 But I'm wondering if there's something else in your life you haven't come to terms with. 
 Turn the next card. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, this is the card of motherhood. 
 Motherhood. 
 Uh, the Empress... She sits in a garden with ultimate compassion and unconditional love. 
 It's a very powerful card. 
 Ca-Can you help me understand what this means? 
 This, um... 
 I can't go down another psychic rabbit hole. 
 I appreciate what you've done with the... with the Gypsies and all of that, but I've done enough of this. 
 Uh, that's fine. 
 We don't... We don't have to continue. 
 I mean, what is a pack of cards gonna tell me about my life, anyway? 
 Well, I-I think the better question would be, what can you learn from the answer? 
 What if it's something I don't want to know? 
 Well, you can't... I mean, I can put these cards back into the deck, but you can't just walk away from what they're saying. 
 I mean, they'll always haunt you. 
 What did you see in these last two cards? 
 Okay, I'll tell you what. 
 What I'm gonna do is I will put these last three cards in an envelope here in my desk, and they'll be here if you change your mind. 
 No. 
 Turn it over. 
 Are you sure, Nadine? 
 I am. 
 The mother and now the child in a garden. 
 Abandoned. 
 Left alone. 
 Keep going. 
 Justice reversed. 
 Something very unfair happened, something that was not right. 
 Tower reversed. 
 [Fire crackling] 
 Something tore your world apart. 
 [Wind whistling] 
 F-for no good reason. 
 [Fire crackling] 
 What happened to that child, Nadine? 
 Oh, God. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Oh, God. 
 [Sobbing] 
 ...and then if you're gonna be like that, he can't surprised when somebody, like, turns around and kicks your ass, you know? 
 Seriously. 
 You know, is that... 
 
 
 
 Oh. Oh. Hey, Mom. I thought you were going out. 
 I thought you were in school. 
 We just got sent home. 
 Mr. Jacobson... uh, he got the flu or something, so it's terrible. 
 Emma. 
 Hi. 
 My mom. 
 Nice to meet you, Mrs. Haverford. 
 Mrs. Haverford's my husband's mother. 
 I'm Linda. 
 Is he bullshitting me about the half day? 
 Well, I mean, there was an assembly that we were supposed to go to if we didn't have class. 
 Uh, I'm a sophomore, though, so, honestly, I'm... I'm in more trouble than he is. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Do you mind if I talk to Nick for a minute? 
 Mm? Mm-hmm. 
 Just wait in the second. 
 Oh, sure, Mrs... uh, Linda. 
 Dude, Gandalf is so dope. 
 Nice. Sophomore? 
 I really like her. 
 You messing anything up in school, missing a day? 
 I know I keep saying this, but this is when your grades start to count for college. 
 Mom, I got this, really. 
 What's the story here? 
 Oh, it's not weed, if that's what you think. 
 I know what oregano smells like. 
 Weed, too. 
 I got it from Fonso. 
 Fonso? 
 Yeah, he... he said, um, it was some kind of love potion or something. 
 You really do like this girl. 
 A lot, yeah. 
 She ditched school with you. Maybe this stuff's working. 
 Tonight, we're gonna talk about your little Adderall scam. 
 You're gonna explain to me why you ground up Vitamin C and what you do with your pills. 
 I'll send your girlfriend in. 
 I hope you don't mind me coming over. 
 I, uh... I just remember when I was a freshman, it was all kind of scary, and Nick is so sweet and shy, and I just... 
 I'm just happy he's making friends. 
 He said that your husband's a psychic. 
 That's so awesome. 
 All my dad is is just a lawyer... my mom, too. 
 Sometimes, a lawyer's exactly what you need. 
 Honestly, it's like a bad '90s sitcom at my house. 
 Nick's in his bedroom. 
 You can help yourself to anything in the fridge. 
 My husband's in with a client, so if you guys can just watch the noise. 
 Yeah, sure. Um, thanks. 
 And don't worry about his schoolwork. 
 Nothing happens freshman year anyways. 
 I was 17. 
 My family is Catholic. 
 Abortion was not an option. 
 And the father? 
 Oh, he was at SC in his freshman year. 
 I honestly didn't like him enough to drag him back into it, so I told my family I didn't know who the father was. 
 How'd that go? 
 Ugh. 
 It was all very old school. 
 My mother arranged a trip to Europe. 
 And I went to a private facility in Ojai. 
 The baby was put up for adoption. 
 My father didn't speak to me for the rest of high school. 
 I went back East to college, and he died, uh, my junior year. 
 But you've never stopped thinking about your child. 
 No. No. 
 Your mom seems chill. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, so if... 
 Oh, right. 
 Sorry. Uh, this is 70. 
 I told my mom I got the whole thing wet, showed her some goo. 
 She called me in a refill, so 90 more by next week, hopefully. 
 That's genius. 
 Can we, uh, play some music or something if we keep it super-soft? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Uh, can I see your... 
 Oh, yeah. Sure. Sorry. 
 Uh, here you go. 
 Dude, have you heard Gods Wisdom? 
 Uh, there's, like, a ton of really weird rap, like, coming out of Western Massachusetts. 
 I'm, uh... I'm just gonna lie down. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, we'll be quiet. 
 Thanks, honey. 
 Yeah, uh, if she's lying down, that means we got to be extra quiet. 
 Do you think it's just that growing up sucks? 
 That's kind of my theory. 
 When you're a kid, everyone tells you what to do, right? 
 Like, somebody's always flying the plane. 
 Growing up is you walk up to the cockpit and there's no pilot. 
 That sounds about right. 
 Because what your dad does, that's really what it's all about, right? 
 I mean, like, people are looking for a pilot. 
 Absolutely. 
 I don't know. 
 I-I used to really resent my parents for that, like, them telling me what to do. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Um... and then, last year, school sucked, like, super-hard, and I was getting kind of too heavy into benzos, and I ran away twice... like, once to Santa Barbara, and then another time to Riverside, which is really not where anybody wants to wind up. 
 Um, but... 
 But you came back. 
 Well, I got brought back. 
 Oh. 
 But, um, I don't know. 
 Something happened the second time... and this is gonna sound super-corny... it was the way my dad said my name when he saw me, like he thought he was never gonna see me again. 
 And then there I was, and I was like, "These are people who love me, no matter what else they are, no matter what else I do." 
 I get that. 
 And then I was like, "I've got, what, four, three more years now? What's bad about being a kid a little longer?" 
 So you're not... you're not thinking about running away anytime soon. 
 I'm here for the duration. 
 That's cool. 
 We can hook up if you want. 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Okay. 
 Do you have anything? 
 Um... 
 Just the Adderall. 
 No, I meant protection. 
 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 Uh... 
 Uh... No. 
 I ran out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You are so cute. I mean, like, really. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I mentioned that I had this dream the other night... very fragmented. 
 You were in it. 
 There was bleachers and sounds of children playing baseball, the smell of candy. 
 Jelly beans, I think. 
 Horrible, senseless loss. 
 And I-I heard a name. 
 It was a Mark or Mike, uh, Miles. 
 Miles. 
 But then I heard Dylan. 
 No. 
 I named him Miles... my baby. 
 [Muffled] Mom, I'm going out. I'll be right back.

 [Grunts] 
 [Music continues] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Okay. [Breathing shakily] 
 [Pounding on door] 
 sh1t. [Pounding continues] 
 [Pounds on door] 
 I was beginning to think you guys were shining me on. 
 Was just doing some cleaning. 
 Ah. 
 You never struck me as the domestic type. 
 Hmm. 
 Charlie around? 
 He's with a client. 
 Yeah, judging by the car in the driveway, a rich client. 
 All-day session. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, can I come in? 
 No. You can't. 
 [Scoffs] Where's the hospitality? 
 I am f*cking furious at you. 
 What? About Sylvia? 
 No. 
 You gave my son a candle and a baggie full of oregano and told him it was a f*ckin' love spell. 
 Hey, what was I supposed to do, huh? 
 Kid comes over all lovelorn. 
 [Thudding] 
 I was doing my "Uncle Fonso" best. 
 Yeah, well, the last thing I need he starts believing in this crap, Uncle Fonso. 
 Thudding] 
 We got people here. 
 They're just doing the repairs after the shooting. 
 You got damage in the kitchen? 
 They're here. 
 Might as well just get what I can out of 'em. 
 I don't see any trucks or anything. 
 It's just one guy. He's doing some cabinets. 
 I think his kid dropped him off. 
 Hi, there. 
 Hope this isn't a bad time. 
 I, uh, brought a peace offering. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I brought a... 
 No, I'm, uh - 
 I'm just in the middle of something. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, well, I saw that, uh, your window was being repaired and all that, and I thought it'd look pretty nice under it. 
 Hmm. 
 That's a good-looking rose. 
 Well, it is now, but you got to deadhead it. 
 Deadhead? 
 What's that mean again? 
 Well, you got to cut it way back till it looks dead. 
 That's how you get the real good blossoms. 
 Sacrifice. 
 Now, that's something I can understand. 
 You know a lot about roses? 
 Oh, yeah. It's like a passion of mine. 
 [Thudding continues] 
 I could come back sometime, show you how to do it... the deadheading, I mean. 
 That'd be great. Really. 
 And thank you. 
 Gary. 
 [Laughs] Right. Gary. Right. 
 Yes. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Um... okay. 
 So, you had any repercussions? 
 What do you mean? 
 This drive-by. 
 I'm having a little trouble with those douchebags... 
 Pardon me... in the South Bay. 
 You think that's who it was? 
 That's why I came by, make sure you guys hadn't had any more trouble. 
 We're fine. 
 Well, I'll keep an eye on out. 
 And, uh... sorry about the love-charm thing. 
 I didn't know what else to do. 
 [Thudding continues, moaning] 
 Hard to get good help these days, huh? 
 Mm. 
 Why don't you go see how badly this guy's f*cked up your cabinets, tell Charlie that I came by, and that I hope everything works out with Nick and that girl. 
 He seemed real crazy about her. 
 [Muffled music plays] 
 God. 
 f*ck. 
 I watched him grow up from a distance. 
 His first day of preschool, I was across the street... watched him walk in, carry his little lunchbox. 
 Grammar school, birthday parties in the park. 
 You said bleachers. He played Little League. 
 I would go to the games. 
 I'd buy him presents... toys, video games. 
 I saw him eat jelly beans, so I would get those. 
 I-I never spoke with him or anything. 
 I just left the presents on the seats. 
 And your husband... 
 Oh, he never knew anything about it. 
 There's more. 
 He was 12. 
 And I knew he hadn't been to school for a while, wasn't playing ball. 
 I was parked across the street from his home, and he came out with his parents. 
 He was very thin. 
 And he'd lost all his hair. 
 [Voice breaking] That was the last time I saw him. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh. I am so sorry. 
 I have taken up your whole day. 
 I don't even know how that happened. 
 Please, stop. It's what I do. 
 And if you ever want to come back for cards or anything... just to talk... I'm here for you. 
 Well, thank you. 
 And thank you for helping me with my... my problem and all that. 
 I mean, you can see now why I was such easy pickings. 
 Well, y-you're an open and a caring person, and there's nothing to be ashamed of. 
 I really appreciate you doing this, Charlie. 
 And thank you for listening. 
 Like I said, it's what I do. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, yourself. 
 Uh, Mrs. Davies, this is my son, Nick. 
 Nick, this is Mrs. Davies. 
 Hey, great Dad you've got here, Nick. 
 Yeah. 
 I thought you said you were gonna be busy for a little while. 
 Yeah, I'm just finishing up. 
 Uh, hey, I'm gonna go to the market. 
 Do you want pork chops? 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, I think we might have company. 
 Weston? 
 No, Emma... my friend. 
 I think she might be a vegan. 
 Well, then I'll make a big salad. 
 I'll walk you out. 
 Oh. 
 Nice meeting you, Nick. 
 Yeah. 
 You, too. 
 Emma, sh1t. I'm so sorry about... 
 Emma? 
 Just a normal deck of cards. 
 Put it in the wine glass. 
 And I will take the top card off. 
 What is that, six of diamonds? 
 Magically, it disappears. 
 It's good, right? 
 Yeah, it's good, yeah. 
 You want to see how it's done? 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, hon. We're in here. 
 All right. 
 There's a pork chop on the stove if you're hungry. 
 Great. Thanks. 
 Hey, did you see Emma before she left? 
 No, honey. 
 I think, uh, she has cold feet. 
 Cold feet? 
 Well, he comes racing into the house with a bag from the drugstore... a little bag. 
 Ah. 
 Hey, guys, th-this is so wrong. 
 You want to see something else wrong? 
 While you were in with Nadine, Eduardo stopped by. 
 Left a little something. 
 Someone gave you a BMW? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Satisfied client of your father's. 
 We're gonna have to do a little explaining to Fonso. 
 He stopped by to see how you were doing. 
 I kind of let him think that the car belonged to your client. 
 We'll tell them that, uh, we took over her lease. 
 How did it go with Nadine? 
 I think I may be of great help to her. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Why do we have to lie to Uncle Fonso about where you got a car? 
 Fonso has some Old World ideas about some things. 
 Gypsy sh1t? 
 Mm. 
 You sure Emma didn't say anything? 
 Because I've been texting her since I got home, and I get nothing. She's not on Facebook. 
 Well, maybe that, uh, love charm didn't work. 
 Love charm? 
 Our son went over to Fonso for a little help. 
 Like most Gypsy sh1t, it didn't work. 
 Cut it out. 
 I'm gonna be in my room. 
 Let's get back to the fact that we have a new BMW. 
 [Laughs] Guess you want to take a ride, huh? 
 I do. 
 What? 
 Nothing. I'm... 
 I was just thinking we really should redo these cabinets.
