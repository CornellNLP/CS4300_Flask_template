 This is the card of motherhood. 
 Baby was put up for adoption. 
 He died when he was 13? 
 12. 
 And then, there's this one Citibank account... 
 $1,773, 480.18. 
 How are you, darling? 
 Want to give Fonso and me a minute here, babe? 
 Sure. 
 My girls got a good education. 
 They teach the girls how to give a sweet blow job? 
 I got you something. 
 Scopolamine... that drug I told you about? 
 Oh, and I would divvy it up if I were you. 
 I got it from Fonso. 
 It was some kind of love potion or something. 
 You really do like this girl. 
 We can hook up if you want. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Do you have anything? 
 Just the Adderall. 
 I meant protection. 
 I ran out.

 The girl died because of crap you brought into my house. 
 It could've been my son.

 All right? You know we did. 
 You're a f*cking cancer. 
 Go back to Vegas or wherever it is your friend is... f*cking Puerto Rico.

 I told you that I didn't do that "talk to the dead" stuff, what used to be called séances. 
 Frankly, I always thought it was kind of woo-woo. 
 [Laughs] Yeah. 
 Over the years, I've seen my share of fakes and frauds, people who con you into thinking they can connect with the spirit world.

 [Grunts] Oh, God. 
 You ever think about using a lightweight alloy, like a titanium composite? 
 It's too expensive. 
 But if you want to get into it over extruded aluminum versus cast iron, I'm all for it. 
 Titanium composite. Where'd you get that? 
 Some DIY show. Apple TV, huh? 
 6 million channels, and, sh1t, the only thing I can find to watch is some asshole fixing his garage. 
 Idiots! Now you have to move the couch! 
 Turn it down a notch, Fab. We can hear you just fine. 
 It's a $4,000 ball. 
 It needs to be placed perfectly so when my customer is sitting, what is he f*cking looking at? 
 We don't know, Fab. What is he f*cking looking at? 
 He is f*cking looking at the f*cking mysteries of life is what he's f*cking looking at.

 Okay. Thanks. 
 Hey. 
 Come here.

 If you had walked in here this morning and told me that Nick Haverford was part of the Adderall abuse problem on campus, I think I would have tossed a matcha latte at you. 
 I am really, terribly sorry about this, as is Nick. 
 Right? 
 I am. I'm really, really sorry. 
 Well, first year of high school is a mine field. 
 Everyone makes mistakes... acting out, testing boundaries, trying to fit in. 
 This will be the last time Nick does anything like this. 
 He's not a dealer. 
 The Adderall is from his prescription. 
 We filled out the medical file at the start of the year. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And are you still seeing your therapist for ADHD? 
 Yes. 
 Well, most kids who are on medication don't abuse it. 
 In fact, the responsible use of drugs is often a good deterrent to abuse. 
 So, consequences... one week suspension, zero-tolerance next time, immediate expulsion if you are discovered with any drug-related activities again. 
 Understood? 
 Yes. 
 And thank you so much. Honestly...

 Get the crystals out of the garage and sort them. 
 A week at home on suspension. 
 You're not gonna spend it on your computer. 
 Go. 
 With any sort of coffee brewing, you have to consider the same three stages... wetting, dissolution, diffusion. 
 And you also have to keep in mind how each stage affects what comes next. 
 What's she doing here? 
 I guided Nadine to the realization that a séance might help her escape her cycle of grief, so she's coming here tomorrow. 
 I think he knows how to run a séance. 
 Nadine saw Vicki here, so she's out, and I remember Gina when she was trying to put the whammy on me. 
 Said she'd worked as a medium, so here we are. 
 [Chuckles] Charlie was so sweet. 
 He was apologizing for how you guys, um, overreacted.

 It's from Ethiopia. You want one? 
 No. Thanks. 
 A séance is the right call.

 I think you're stereotyping. 
 Yep. You sound like your cousin.

 Oklahoma. Yeah, he did. 
 Funny thing about that night. 
 My cousin, Cousin Lou, he gets up to use the toilet, doesn't come back. 
 [Laughs] What? Fell in? 
 Yeah, you can laugh, but the thing is, his wife, she's in a panic, the kind where she comes over to the house and starts talking sh1t about how I must know who he's shacked up with on account that I no doubt have somebody on the side. 
 This is in front of Simza and all. 
 [Inhales sharply] What'd you do? 
 I go to see his kamardi. Both of them. 
 Neither one of them has seen him. 
 You know what it might have been? 
 No, I don't. I have no idea. 
 Alien abduction. 
 He's up there right now... flying saucer, little gray guys sticking sh1t right up his ass. 
 [Laughs] 
 See, the thing of it is, while it might be aliens, last anybody saw of him, he was going in the can. 
 So were you.

 What are you accusing me of, huh? 
 I went in the bathroom, I killed him, and I came back and listened to the band?

You just need to sharpen the skill set that came with it a little bit. Hold on. The lady's cat. I-I went in there and pulled it out. I couldn't stand the thought of this little guy in there. [Cat purring] He's a girl. Minerva. Yeah, well, she's yours now. Like I said, you have the gift, my friend. Figure out how to use it. I had this vision of burning flesh, and then this woman who works for me was severely burned in a fire... Hmm. ...just a few hours later. Sounds crazy, doesn't it? No. Like I said, I have no issue believing that you can see the future. I mean, I suppose a skeptic might argue for coincidence, but in my opinion, there is no such thing as coincidence. Is this one of your mushroom insights? I like to think of coincidence as random cosmic enlightenment. From God? Have you told your wife about any of this? Not yet. You're all done. You're a new man. So, what? I'm supposed to just wait until God tells me whatever's supposed to happen next? Okay, you know, before we go with the whole message from on high, there's a less-exotic possibility that I'd like to rule out. What's that? Well, like, there could be delayed swelling in your brain, and you're gonna stroke out from an embolism. Swelling? That's what's causing the visions? Possibly. No God. Well, you know what they say... "The kingdom of heaven is within you." You're not claustrophobic, are you? If you have any problems, you just let us know, and we'll slide you on out, okay? Yeah. I'm good to go.
