 Previously on "Shut Eye"... 
 My cousin, cousin Lou, he gets up to use the toilet, doesn't come back. 
 They teach the girls how to give a sweet blow job at the same time they teach 'em to read, or is that a separate class? 
 I had nothing to do with cousin Lou. 
 You said you had something for me? 
 Scopolamine. Too much, not a good thing. 
 [Sniffs] 
 That girl died because of crap you brought into my house. 
 It could have been my son. 
 [Grunting] 
 Get the f*ck away from me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hey, did you see Emma before she left? 
 No, honey. 
 Your perp alibi'd out. 
 So we're here to ask, again. 
 You have anything you want to tell us? 
 $1.7 million? 
 Closer to $1.8 million. 
 That is get out of town money. 
 Love is stronger than death. 
 [Glass shatters] 
 It's a sign. He's sending us a message. 
 Miles. 
 Fancy lady. You tell Fonso? 
 That I have a rich client? I have a few of 'em. 
 You're working her long. 
 What do you want? 
 Give me my piece, or I tell Fonso. 
 Charlie sent you? 
 You really need to stop being a pain in the ass to him. 
 [Grunts] [Screaming] 
 I'm supposed to just wait for God to tell me what horrible thing is supposed to happen next? 
 There's a less exotic possibility that I'd like to rule out. 
 You're not claustrophobic, are you? 
 [Static crackling, alarm buzzing] 
 [Machine buzzing] 
 [Alarm buzzing] 
 [Gasping] 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 Your MRI showed no swelling, no increased activity in your pineal gland, which means we have ruled out the physical. 
 So what are we back to? Messages from up high? 
 Demonic possession? 
 What happened? 
 I was underwater and I-I couldn't breathe. 
 That's... awful. 
 You gave me mushrooms. 
 No, I want Big Pharma! Pills! 
 Real  pills from  real  chemists, the kind that will turn this sh1t off. 
 Listen, these messages from your unconscious, from your soul... I mean, call it whatever you will... 
 I think that there's a way to clarify them, a way to read them, a way to... 
 And I, they're very readable. 
 I had a vision of burning flesh, and guess what? A woman burned. 
 People die every day. 
 I just don't wanna know about it. [Sniffs] 
 I want... just want this sh1t to stop. 
 If you're asking me, I don't think it will.

 No. 
 So, Nick, what was Emma doing at your house? 
 We were going to do homework. 
 You said "going to." 
 What did you guys do instead? 
 We listened to music, then she left. 
 Did she say anything about where she was going? 
 Was she planning on running away? 
 No, no, no, no, no. Um... the opposite of that, actually. 
 How do you mean? 
 [Sighs deeply] She said that she had run away before, but when she did, she missed her family. 
 We found Emma's phone. It died on a bus in Bakersfield. 
 But we got Emma's text log in, and you sent her a message. 
 "Sorry." 
 The weird thing is, no one's heard from her after that.

 They're starting a task force now, coming after the families. 
 Hmm. Too bad we can't just let the chips fall.

 He said that it... it was like time is out of joint. 
 I mean, isn't that beautiful? Sounds schizophrenic to me. 
 No, but there's no physical source. 
 I ran all the tests, Denny. 
 I mean, he saw something, and then it actually happened. 
 Okay, so is this a "high on your own supply" situation? 
 You know, like you started hitting the mushrooms. 
 No, this is a real world real, not altered state real.

 I saw him have a vision. 
 I-I'm sorry, but how do you... how do you see someone have a vision? 
 I don't know, but I just know it's true. 
 And if he really is seeing something, I mean... and just give me that. 
 Just give me that for a second, okay? 
 If he is, then the only other obvious question is, "Why?"
