 This card suggests that he's cheating on you. 
 [Both grunting] 
 You're a magician? 
 I'm a housewife. 
 My husband, though, he's a psychic. 
 Oh. 
 You had a bad experience. 
 God gave the gypsies the right to steal. 
 Stealing from gypsies, however, will f*ck you inside and out. 
 Sylvia made a mistake. 
 We are the Marks family. 
 Charlie! 
 We don't want you to forget who we are.

 Look, I'm gonna give you the name of a neurologist. 
 She's a bit unorthodox, but head trauma's her specialty.

 Your son doesn't have Asperger's. 
 I won't forget this. 
 He used to be another man, my Charlie.

 Cocksucker. 
 Motherfucking cocksucker. 
 He f*cking rats out your sister and stands there singing while that c**t Rita scars her for life? 
 And now he's outside of our house. 
 He's sending a message. 
 Even by Roma standards, they're being pretty f*cked up. 
 Imagine how f*cked up they  would  be if they ever find out we're not listening to that message. 
 You're not having second thoughts, are you? 
 No. 
 They deserve this, and so do we. 
 So, the other day, I'm walking down the street and I'm multitasking, which is a physical impossibility, by the way. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm texting and I'm walking, and I step in it. 
 Big, runny dog turd. 
 And from what my wife tells me, you've stepped in it with one of these assholes, and that is a profession full of turds. 
 There's no denying it. 
 L-Linda told me that you were in the business. 
 I'm intuitive. 
 People tell me that my intuitions sometimes help. 
 And sometimes my intuitions are not all that helpful. 
 [All chuckle] 
 I don't do hocus-pocus, no past lives, no messages from Grandma. 
 Oh, grandmothers. 
 [Sighs] 
 Mine on both sides were, well, awful, frankly. 
 See, that... these phonies, they'll use that. 
 They'll register that you had two grandmothers that were bitches. 
 The implications... that one or both of your grandfathers had mistresses. 
 One, I think. 
 Your father's father. Swedish. 
 Amazing. 
 Her name was Helga. 
 The housekeeper. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're giving away the tricks of the trade here, honey. 
 I just want Nadine to see how easy it is to fool you. 
 It's called a cold reading. 
 There's nothing supernatural to it. 
 Your house in this neighborhood... old money. 
 That's easy. 
 Bitchy women are often bitchy because they're smart and neglected. 
 Old money means Scandinavian help. 
 Well, at least it did back in the 1950s. 
 And, uh, if you had balked at Swedish, I would have done some sort of double-talk and backtracked around, uh, Chinese. 
 Wonderful. 
 Well, it is until they get you to the ATM to take the curse off your money. 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 Oh. 
 How much did you give them? 
 Almost $78,000. 
 I went at first, I... 
 Oh, no, no. 
 I'd... I'd rather not know anything about your past. 
 Not yet. 
 It's your pride even more than the money. 
 You open up, you trust. 
 And step in dog... poop. 
 [Door opens] 
 I hope you can forgive my husband's frankness. 
 I wish we could have been more helpful. 
 Um, I don't know what I expected, really. It's just... 
 Your husband... Did you tell him all of this? 
 Adam? Oh, gosh, no. 
 Not the supportive type? 
 He's a real-estate developer. 
 So no. 
 And he's out of town. 
 How do you know that? 
 Two cars in the driveway middle of day, no one's home. 
 He's a real-estate developer. He must travel. 
 Yeah. 
 He's, uh, looking at a shopping mall in, um... 
 Albuquerque. 
 Then one in El Paso, and somewhere in Oklahoma after that. 
 He'll be back in two weeks. 
 Honey? 
 I'm sorry. Was I being weird? 
 You were being a little bit weird. 
 [Laughing] I'm sorry. 
 Uh, you were seeing this, uh, "psychic," and, uh, was it on a regular basis? 
 Yeah. Uh, two appointments a week, like a therapist. 
 She came here to your house? 
 Uh, not at first, but then... 
 You broke it off. 
 About a month ago. 
 She got angry. 
 Very. 
 You think  amraya? 
 If she was Roma. 
 They did tell her there was a curse on her money. 
 A curse. 
 Mm. 
 Is... Is that what you sensed? 
 My advice... you look like you can afford it... cut your losses. 
 The Roma people, uh, gypsies... though they don't prefer that term... if you're not one of them, you are fair game. 
 [Sighs] 
 You have a good security system, right? 
 Oh, state of the art. 
 My husband's a stickler for that. 
 You'll be fine. But just don't forget to set it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Take care of yourself. 
 Oh. Thanks. 
 Mm.

 So, you think the husband's got something going on in Albuquerque? 
 Or El Paso or wherever he goes on his real-estate trips. 
 You heard the tone. 
 No kids? 
 No. 
 Makes it easier. 
 "I'd rather you didn't tell me." 
 Just put the card back in the deck. 
 Don't let me see it. 
 [Chuckles] You are a master. 
 We crossed a serious line back there. 
 You think? 
 [Brakes creak] 
 [ Music playing indistinctly over radio ] 
 We could still turn it over to Rita and Fonso, tell them we primed the pump. 
 Charlie. 
 I just want us both to say it out loud. 
 We crossed a serious line. 
 We did. 
 [Laughs] 
 There's something else, I think. 
 There's a ruin there.

 Well, you know, your brain can only access the sh1t that you memorize when it's in the same state as you were when you were learning it, right?

 Here for a reading? 
 Your perp alibied out.

 We had probable cause. 
 Got him on misdemeanor steroids. 
 But he was at the gym spotting the guy he sells steroids to, even as your house was getting shot up. 
 So, we're here to ask again. 
 You have anything you want to tell us? 
 My life is an open book. 
 Mm. 
 Well, how about we take a look at that open book? 
 Client list. 
 Anything you'd like to share. 
 This was a drive-by. 
 Why assume it has anything to do with us? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're scam artists. 
 Criminals, in my opinion. 
 A shooting in the vicinity of criminal activity? 
 Math is easy. 
 If it wasn't the angry boyfriend, then we were just, like Linda said, collateral damage. 
 Yeah, be nice to substantiate that. 
 With, for example, a client list. 
 Make sure you don't have any more angry customers. 
 I'm sorry, You have to understand, what I do, it's like I'm a doctor or a priest. 
 I can't. 
 Are you actually trying to claim the sanctity of the psychic couch? 
 [Laughs] 
 That's f*cking awesome. 
 Bullshit, but awesome. 
 Well, I appreciate you... 
 Hey, whoa. 
 Honey? 
 You all right? 
 I just, uh, got dizzy. 
 Charlie needs his rest, if you don't mind. 
 Listen, if, uh, he's gonna get all wobbly and sh1t every time we ask a tough question, you might want to invest in a fainting couch. 
 Play nice.

 Oh, you  were  faking. 
 Whatever works, right?

 I parked a few blocks away when I saw the cops. 
 You need to get a better lock on your back door.

 She's a total mess. 
 That house was sick, bro. 
 How'd you get in? 
 Knocked on the front door. [Chuckles]

 I, uh, had to fake a call to AAA, but she totally bought it. 
 She stepped away, I started snapping. 
 Home brewing? What's that about?

 Six. 
 Every time you do an automatic writing with invisible ink, you use 1.6 ounces. 
 So if I come over and I check the ink supply, I'll find 9.6 ounces gone, not 11.5 or 12.8, and I won't find the ink supply watered down? 
 It won't happen again. 
 It will, and I'll know when it does.

 Are you gonna tell Fonso?

 Depends. 
 I might need your help with something Linda and I are working on. 
 But I need to know I can trust you, that you'll keep it between us. 
 Of course. 
 I'm not f*cking around, Ted. 
 You tell anyone what's going on, and Fonso will pay both of us a visit, and it'll be much worse than what happened to my sister.

 Absolutely. Whatever you need.

 Uh, I... I think we're getting off on the wrong foot. 
 Yeah. That already happened. 
 I know who you are. 
 I got your note... I mean three notes... about the sign being too bright. 
 Well, I... I was hoping to talk, now that... that you got a replacement sign, about something a little less ostentatious. 
 A man died, Gary. 
 I just thought maybe you'd want to be part of the neighborhood and not just an eyesore. 
 Hey. 
 Here's the thing, Gary. 
 You want to be a part of the neighborhood, maybe come over, plate of cookies or something, ask us nicely about the sign instead of your squirrelly-ass little notes printed in, what, four different fonts and slipped in our mailbox when no one's home.

He wouldn't take a sh1t in his own house without asking for my permission. The other day before the council, he came to me to ask for mercy for his sister. Were you aware of this? No. Well... then he doesn't tell you everything. [Keys jingle] [Birds chirping] ♪♪ [Cellphone chirps] What about his wife? Did you ever ask her something? I mean, she...

I just find you interesting. What kind of counseling? I'm more of an administrator. I own several clinics. You know, I'm an ordinary guy and I don't do drugs and my best drinking days are behind me. What happened to me, this kind of brain injury, could it... could it change the way I see things? Bad fish can change the way you see things. Can you be more specific? I'm hearing things. Colors are too bright. Time is out of joint. What does that mean? What does that mean, "time is out of joint"? [Sighs softly] You say you don't do drugs. Back in the day, you ever take acid?

Well, it's not dissimilar to the aura that prefaces a migraine. Usually it goes away. Then the headaches begin? Or the acid trip. [Scoffs] I'm not reassuring you, am I? Not so much. Huh. Well, there's no such thing as sudden onset insanity, if that helps. [Chuckles dryly] I mean, sometimes there are instances of depression or schizophrenia after a blow like yours, but those are things you have to look forward to.

You're suggesting that I faked all of this to get away from my baseball wife? Well, a Freudian might offer that you went out looking for that blow to the head, but I am not a Freudian by any stretch. No, I'm suggesting that something in your basic nature is rebelling against what you've become and is using your injury as an excuse to try other... options. You know what, f*ck this.
