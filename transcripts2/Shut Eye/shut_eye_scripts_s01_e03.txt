 Previously on "Shut Eye"... 
 If you can't produce... 
 I can. 
 I got plenty others. 
 What's this? 
 Nadine Davies. 
 We have a very big whale on our hands. 
 What about Fonso? 
 I'm done being someone's bitch. 
 You think Amraya? 
 They did tell her there was a curse on her money. 
 The Roma people... if you're not one of them, they will happily trick you out of every cent you have. 
 We've seen some very nasty tricks. 
 Aah! 
 You know, I'm an ordinary guy and I don't do drugs. 
 What happened to me, this kind of brain injury, could it change the way I see things? 
 Colors are too bright. 
 Give me that pencil! 
 I'm hearing things. 
 No, you don't! 
 With head injuries, there's just no rule book. 
 Glad you didn't bring your husband this time. 
 f*ckin' Gina. 
 Yeah, Fonso. 
 You're not gonna believe this. 
 I needed to know. 
 Was I ever gonna find my one true love? 
 Asshole put himself in the commercial. 
 Make fun, but White Tony is raking it in down there in South Bay. 
 The guy frying, and he's gonna tell me that he had nothing to do with any drive by. 
 He's lying. 
 Who the f*ck are you, I'm lying? 
 [Screams] 
 Hey. 
 I didn't hear you come in last night. 
 Yeah, it was pretty late. I didn't want to wake you, so I slept on the couch. 
 This cereal tastes strange. 
 Like, metallic. 
 Tastes like ball bearings. 
 How'd it go with Eduardo? 
 The kid was lying. 
 Who was? 
 I don't even know his name. 
 But he was making way too much eye contact. 
 He pulled on his earlobe and he put a sack of flour in between him and Eduardo. 
 It was obvious. 
 I was trying to just keep my client on the hook. 
 And all I said was, "He's lying." 
 Eduardo killed him. 
 Honey, that's not your fault. 
 You didn't know that was gonna happen. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're right. 
 Hey. 
 We knew Eduardo was into some bad sh1t. 
 Put it out of your head. 
 He's the kind of man who knows how to cover his tracks. 
 You remember the first time we ever had a real conversation? 
 I think it was the third time I had come into the club. 
 You told me you could make an elephant disappear. 
 Then you asked me if I believed that. 
 And you said you didn't believe in anything. 
 And it was that moment I knew I would fall in love with you. 
 You didn't say, "Bullshit." 
 You didn't say, "Wow, how do you do that?" 
 You said, "I don't believe." 
 And I did fall in love with you. 
 I love you, Linda. 
 And every choice I make, everything I do, it's all for you. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hello? 
 Hi, Nadine. 
 How are you? 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 So sorry to hear that. 
 Of course. 
 Let me just wake Charlie. 
 We'll be right over. 
 Okay. 
 Bye-bye. 
 ♪♪ 
 We have to get dressed. 
 What did the police say? 
 That the tree hadn't been tampered with and there was no sign of a break-in. 
 Tie this around a branch, attach a chain to a bumper, and you could pull that tree down without a mark. 
 Did you set the alarm before you went to bed? 
 W-Well, of course. 
 Your alarm code is 72856. 
 How do you know? 
 I Googled your husband's birthday. 
 I had a feeling he was kind of vain. 
 These bastards are serious. 
 When you broke it off with this woman, the fortune teller, did she ask for more money? 
 $10,000. 
 She said it was severance pay. 
 Give her $20,000. 
 What? 
 You give them the $10,000, they'll be back in a month for more. 
 We've seen that happen. 
 More than once, I'm afraid. 
 What I can make sure of is this is a one-time situation, that they don't keep coming back. 
 How do you do that? 
 I know a cop. We go together, offer a deal. 
 We won't press charges, double the offer they ask for. 
 But they can never come back. They'll believe that? 
 They'll believe $20,000 no-risk dollars and a visit from a cop. 
 I'm sure you want this over before you husband gets back. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'll write you a check. 
 I just can't believe how stupid I was, how gullible. I... 
 Don't be too hard on yourself. It happens. 
 It's not gonna happen again. 
 The drawbridge is up. No one gets in. 
 We can take care of the rooster, too. 
 It could have been worse. 
 Could have been a real curse.

 For Dixie and Gaya, I was thinking maybe some New Age-y things, Noho being what it is. 
 I Ching coins, Books of Shadows, incense. 
 And then there's a masonry supplies guy out in Simi Valley who can do bulk crystals for half the price of Bourget Brothers. 
 [Crackling] 
 Did you hear that? 
 Hear what? 
 It's like mice in the walls. 
 It's like a crackling. 
 You ought to go see that Dr. White, 'cause that sound... I'm not hearing it. 
 Really, honey. 
 You better get yourself checked out. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 "And in the last sip, she turns the mug upside-down, coffee grounds streak the saucer, finding future fortunes in what others call a stain." 
 [Applause] 
 [Laughs] 
 Beautiful, Jasmine. 
 I am reminded of my own grandmother's journey from the Craica in Baia Mare to the streets of Marseille, and finally, to her family waiting here in America. 
 Where dreams come true. 
 But for us, the promises have been slow in coming. 
 Stereotypes die hard, and as long as there are Italian criminals, African-American crack dealers, Jewish pawnbrokers, those stereotypes will continue. 
 Maybe they all change jobs for a while. 
 Jewish crack dealers, black gangsters, Italian pawnbrokers. 
 We would start to see things differently. 
 [Light laughter] 
 And who are we? 
 The people who fix your roof so badly, it leaks worse in the next rain than it did before you fixed it. 
 The "tramps and thieves"... the fortune tellers. 
 Those of you here who don't know our culture have most likely come today because you suspect there's more to it than that, and you're right. 
 Ours is a rich and deep heritage. 
 A heritage of persecution and pride and poetry. 
 [Applause] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Look, I didn't know who else to call. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Dolce & Gabbana? 
 What's that, $2,500 for a f*cking dress? 
 I wanted to look nice for you. 
 You wanted the $2,500. 
 Please. I would have been lucky to get $500. 
 I'm... Well, I was kind of counting on getting the job with you guys. 
 I'm not exactly well-heeled. 
 Hand to mouth in Vegas, I have been there. 
 Look, shoplifting is not a long-term solution. 
 Look, I was thinking. 
 If I can stay here, I could be an asset in the business. 
 We don't need a shoplifter. 
 Well, I can't go back. 
 Greg recommended me to you so he could get rid of me without any trouble. 
 What kind of trouble? 
 Wife trouble. 
 Ah. 
 You ever use, um... scopolamine? 
 What is that, like mouthwash? 
 [Chuckles] It's a hypnotic drug. 
 I blow it in your face, you empty your bank account. 
 Don't remember you did it. 
 It's amazing stuff, really. 
 You just got to be careful. 
 I mean, I could show you. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 You're hustling me? 
 That's why you find me so irresistible, right? 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 What the f*ck? No rabbit stew? 
 Mm. 
 I like that commercial you did, huh? 
 You're a young Robert De Niro. 
 Very intense. 
 Oh. 
 How are you, darling, hmm? 
 Your mom didn't come? 
 Uh, she doesn't approve of my cousin's cultural efforts. 
 Ah. Well, I think it's important... get out there, build bridges. 
 Want to give Fonso and me a minute here, babe? 
 Sure. 
 I'll go talk to the girls about shoes. 
 Ooh. 
 See, that's the downside to all this modernization. 
 Now we get attitude. 
 Ah, it's a modern world. 
 I think we should talk a little bit about Koreatown. 
 I just want to make sure we don't have a problem here. 
 Okay. 
 I understand that you, uh, you want to expand. 
 You know, it's only natural. 
 I understand. 
 And I'm glad you can appreciate that. 
 I do. I really do. 
 Here's what works for me. 
 I stay north of Olympic, you take it south. 
 You get the larger area. 
 Only downside is, you got a lot of Central American trade. 
 Those curanderos can get pretty intense. 
 I hate going into those places. 
 Now, the Koreans... they read your fortune from your facial expressions. 
 Fuckers don't even invest in a deck of cards. 
 So, are they gonna be a problem? 
 We got a guy in the Businessmen's Association. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, we're good? 
 Yeah, we're good. 
 It wouldn't be a pachiv without music. 
 Please welcome The Lemon Bucket Orchestra!

 Support. 
 What it is. 
 Michael's my cousin. 
 Can't you just write a check? 
 I wish. 
 What's your excuse? 
 White T says it's good for the image. 
 I hear Bibi talking to some of the other wives about the girls going to school. 
 It's the 21st century, Lou. 
 Some fancy-ass Harvard or something. 
 All the movie stars' kids and all? 
 Well, it's a good school. 
 My girls will get a good education. 
 Right. 
 So let me ask you. 
 At this "good school" they go to... they teach the girls how to give a sweet blow job at the same time they teach them to read, or is that a separate class?

 La de da. 
 [Singing continues] 
 Clean up in the bathroom. 
 In other words, an auditory reversal in which the subject believes that they are hearing voices from the future, from events that haven't yet transpired. 
 So, you got a second opinion from a podcast. 
 That's [clears throat] a little insulting. 
 But, I mean, what's next, a f*cking TED Talk? 
 What's this guy talking about? Sounds a lot like me. 
 Yeah. In med school, we used to call it Intern's Disease. 
 The interns would get the symptoms of every disease they read about. 
 What you would have is called WebMD Syndrome. 
 Did you get as far as Othello? 
 There's an Othello Syndrome related to certain kinds of head trauma. 
 It's also called morbid jealousy. 
 So in the last few days, are you getting the suspicion that your wife's being unfaithful? 
 Why would anyone want to cheat on me? 
 Maybe you're not everything she dreamed of. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You should know delusions that follow organic insult are often empty of psychological significance. 
 Ideation is not necessarily a direct result. 
 Although, there is an argument to be made for the epistemic nature of some delusion. 
 Is that high-tone enough for you? 
 I'm having these symptoms. 
 Colors are too bright. 
 Food tastes wrong. 
 I am hearing conversations before they happen. 
 You said on the phone you had an alternative treatment. 
 First of all, I want you to know that I believe you completely. 
 You're getting glimpses into the future. 
 Time is out of joint, as you put it. 
 It's a lovely turn of phrase. 
 The other day, I asked you if you'd ever taken LSD. 
 Your medical advice is for me to drop acid. 
 I am a big believer in locus. In the Terminal Points... the Omega Point in Quantum Physics, for example. 
 It's where different dimensions intersect. 
 So, the things I'm experiencing... they're coming from another dimension. 
 The things you are describing are symptoms, as you learned from the Internet, of mild traumatic brain injury. 
 The question is not what they are or even if they're real. 
 The question is how to make them stop. 
 Do you want them to stop? And you're suggesting LSD. 
 No. My own research has been with psilocybin. 
 I am already hearing things. 
 I'm already seeing things. 
 Isn't this putting gas on a fire? 
 I want to take you back to where things got f*cked up and un-fuck them. 
 I have seen marvelous results with psilocybin in terms of shaking up the head. 
 I would really love the chance to rock your world. 
 Mm. 
 You asked me if I ever did acid when I was a kid. 
 Did it a dozen times, and I liked it. 
 Gods were making love in the clouds. 
 The universe seemed to make sense. 
 Then one day, I had this bad trip. 
 I wanted to listen to some music, and so I pulled out Prince's "Parade." 
 "Sometimes It Snows in April," right? 
 And then I thought if I listened to Prince, what about Simple Minds? 
 What about the "Amadeus" soundtrack? 
 "Concerto in C with Flute and Harp"? 
 What about Van Halen? "1984?" 
 I just stared at those records. 
 I couldn't decide. 
 I couldn't decide. 
 For four hours, I sat on the floor crying. 
 Well, like all great teachers, psychedelics inform by metaphor. 
 I was 17. 
 My decisions were Prince or Van Halen. 
 Now my life is a little more complicated. 
 I understand that, but look, I really have seen this work. 
 I think it could be really helpful. 
 I think what would be helpful is if I found another doctor. 
 It's been a trip. 
 You ready to order? 
 I'm not hungry. 
 But I'll take a refill. 
 Okay. 
 Is this Hawaiian Kona Reserve made from a French press? 
 I'm pretty sure it's just Folgers or whatever it is we usually have. 
 Interesting. 
 [Laughing] I like it. 
 Are you okay? 
 To be honest, I don't think so. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I get it. 
 Sometimes the best place to be alone is in a crowd. 
 Stay as long as you want. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Go. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So, do you still have that Adderall? 
 Oh, the Adderall. Uh, yeah, I do. At home, yeah. 
 I think, if you want, I could get rid of some of it for you. 
 Um... Those jocks... they think... 
 They think it's performance-enhancing. 
 We could probably get like 10 bucks a pill. 
 That is, if you don't need it for your focus. 
 Oh, I don't have a focus problem. 
 I have a boredom problem. 
 [Laughs] That's pretty tight. 
 You should post that. 
 The Drums. I f*cking love The Drums. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Um, they chill me out a lot when I have, like, work to do or something. [Chuckles]

 It was a good event. 
 I could have done with less of the poetry bullshit, but whatever. 
 I got a busy day today, so just tell me what you want. 
 I'm following up on our conversation yesterday. 
 When you were leaving. 
 Enlighten me. 
 I was kind of in a state. 
 You said, "If there's anything I can do to help..." 
 So I was just...

 He thinks he's superior. 
 That's not true.

 I was just... I was wondering... 
 Um, could I talk to just... 
 Have a second with you? 
 Just me and you. 
 Man to man. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 So, what's going on with you, hm? 
 Well, you know, I was just wondering, um... 
 What... What I was gonna ask Mrs. Marks was that there's this... there's this girl at my school, and... 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 We don't arrange for any, uh, operations, anything like that. 
 No. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 That's... That's not what I meant. 
 It's... It's just that I kind of like her, you know? 
 Like, a lot. And, um... 
 I'm not really sure. You know, sometimes it seems like she... she kind of likes me back a little bit. 
 Just the tiniest bit. But I want to... 
 I don't know how to find out if... 
 Love's a bitch. 
 Come on. I got something for you. 
 Last night at 4:00 in the morning, I moved the furniture in my office and tore up the floor looking for a sound that wasn't there. 
 You said you wanted a chance to rock my world? 
 Well, I would say my world has already been rocked. 
 You had mentioned looking for a second opinion. 
 Maybe we should just do this. 
 Okay. 
 There's something I find both more... 
 I don't know... therapeutic and, uh, I don't know... organic about the traditional method of ingestion. 
 Uh, I'm afraid there might be some vomiting involved. 
 I always had a tough time with that part. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You might want to call your wife, let her know that you will be here overnight. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You do not want to trip without the warmth of vinyl. 
 Dual moving coil cartridge. 
 Decent speakers. 
 I have got that Mozart "Concerto in C" and I've got Miles, of course. 
 And I've got Ornette Coleman for the patients that piss me off. 
 But given your history with choice, I think we should just stick with Mozart. 
 Okay, it takes about 45 minutes to kick in. 
 I remember. 
 Um, you're gonna be fine, okay? 
 So just stay here and relax. 
 The record will just keep going. 
 Unless you actually stop it, the arm lifts up and goes back to the beginning and the concerto just starts again. 
 It's a miracle of 1950s technology. 
 Uh, so, I will be back before you can say Jerry Garcia, okay? 
 So just sit.

 I'm all about the brighter bloom. 
 So, what are you looking for? 
 A brighter bloom. 
 How many mushrooms? 
 A lot. 
 And you saw something. 
 A ring of fire. 
 [Deep voice] "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash." 
 Cards on the table? 
 I'm a carny. 
 I'm bullshit. 
 So far, we're in complete agreement. 
 Something's happening to me. 
 You're on mushrooms. What'd you expect? 
 I'm hearing things. 
 Getting glimpses. 
 Stuff that's about to happen. 
 [Chuckles] A fake psychic, real visions. 
 That'd be a cosmic joke on God's part. 
 Man, for you, that would be serious world-view f*ck. 
 Cosmic joke or karma... either way, you're in trouble. 
 Reminds me of those cartoons. 
 Sylvester the Cat... he's got an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, and one's telling him to kill Tweety and the other one's telling him to love all the animals. 
 It's in a cat's nature to kill a bird. 
 Doesn't make it right. 
 What should I do? 
 You got to decide, man. 
 Decide? 
 Who you're gonna listen to. 
 Angels or the devils. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 Jesus, Charlie. I've been looking for your everywhere. 
 Wow. Okay. You are high as f*ck. 
 How many did you take? 
 All of them. 
 Okay. I need you to come inside. I need to run an I. V. 
 I can't have one of my patients wandering around out here while he's still tripping. 
 I really don't care about your problems right now. 
 What happened? 
 I made a decision. 
 What? To pull the fire alarm? 
 No, that was f*cked up. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know what to do now. 
 I know things about people. 
 Uncomfortable truths. 
 And I'm tired of holding back. 
 Wait, where are you going? 
 I'm hungry. 
 This really is good. 
 As far as I'm concerned, you can take all the hipsters from Brooklyn to Echo Park and throw them out there in the ocean. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'd pay good money to watch them drown. 
 Uh, just one thing... Can we keep the food? 
 There's hipsters in Vegas, too, now. 
 Curated slots? 
 Retro roulette? 
 Crafted craps? 
 Sadly, it's more generic than that. 
 It's beards, tats, Thai street cuisine. 
 Ah. Like I said. 
 Can we keep the food? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Did you grow up there? 
 In Vegas? 
 No one did. 
 My husband. 
 He was born and bred. 
 Well, that explains some things. 
 Such as? 
 Hmm, why you eat pussy. 
 Why he is one. 
 You said I wasn't your first anything. 
 You've f*cked other hypnotists? 
 f*cked other hustlers. 
 You know The Sapphire on Industrial Road? 
 Only to drive by. 
 I did nine years. 
 Oh, yeah.

 Excuse me, miss. 
 Can I have just a little more? 
 You're basically a very sensitive person, aren't you? 
 And sometimes people in your life don't see that. 
 That makes you sad, doesn't it? 
 I It's all right. 
 I'm sorry. I just, uh... 
 I sometimes get feelings about people. 
 It's all right. 
 And sometimes I get a name. 
 I'm getting a name. 
 It starts with the letter "J." 
 Um... John? 
 Jack. 
 My grandfather's name was James. 
 He's passed, hasn't he? 
 Almost three years. 
 Next month. 
 You were close. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just that I got such a strong sense of sadness, and then I heard Jimmy's voice. 
 We called him Jimmy. 
 I know. 
 He wants you to know it wasn't meant to be. 
 Marriages end. 
 Jimmy wants you to know that. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Mm. 
 There's more. 
 Yeah? 
 He wants you to know it's all right to be alone. 
 Sometimes people... they're made to live quiet lives with no one else with them. 
 H-He what? 
 He says he's always there with you, watching. 
 But you need to stop wasting your time trying to find someone. 
 Because it's never gonna happen. 
 But I'm... 
 I'm only 34. 
 He says you'll always be alone. 
 He says... you should get used to it.
