 Previously on "Shut Eye"... 
 These allegations... murder... 
 [Grunting] 
 ...police raid... 
 We have a warrant to search the premises. 
 ...these are serious charges, yet, I know from where the poison springs. 
 These families will be joined in marriage between Fonso's eldest, Drina, and White Tony's son, Little Tony. 
 Let the peace begin. 
 You can't make me marry that little creep. 
 You do what we tell you. 
 This is so wrong. 
 God damn it! 
 [Gags] 
 I know you're hurting. 
 Emma's dead, and people think I did it. 
 And now  you're  gonna protect  me? 
 Yes. I will. 
 We can take this money and that pink gypsy dick of yours, and hop a flight to Vegas. 
 I love Vegas. 
 On the night before the crucifixion, a gypsy boy stole the golden nail. 
 To repay him, God gave the gypsies the right to steal. 
 Stealing from gypsies, however, will f*ck you inside and out. 
 Hello? 
 White Tony sent us to do the install. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 Security cameras in your office. 
 You work for White Tony now! 
 I'm not doing this! 
 It's sweet that you think you got a choice in the matter! 
 You want us to earn, we're no good to you dead. 
 You ever steal from me or think about laying a finger on me personally, you'll wish you were dead. 
 Didn't I show you loyalty? 
 I woke up today $1 million poorer. 
 Now you're gonna make things right financially by kicking back to me whatever it is you paid the gypsies. 
 What was your plan exactly? 
 You're go after Nadine, and then what? 
 You and little Miss Sunshine would sail off to a tropical paradise? 
 Leave me holding the bag with Fonso. 
 But you got played. 
 You let somebody else handle the money. 
 f*ck! 
 White Tony... he's our master, we're his property. 
 f*cking Fonso wants to kill us, and we are going to lose Nick. 
 We need to go after all of them. 
 I know I haven't been producing up to my potential. 
 I'd like to offer you, out of a sign of respect to your son's wedding, a magic trick. 
 How much is it gonna cost me? 
 My gift to you. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 This better be about my money, Charlie. 
 Have you ever been to a gypsy wedding? 
 What? 
 The main entrance is here. 
 This hallway leads to some back offices in the kitchen. 
 But this is where the guests will be. 
 How many people we talking about? 
 I don't know. It's a big room, so expect a lot. 
 These people, they come covered in bling... gold, rings, jewelry. 
 That's just the men. 
 There's a gypsy tradition, they give cash money to the bride, so they'll be flashing a roll. 
 Sounds like a target-rich environment. 
 That's not even including the wedding gifts, parents on both sides will spend a fortune. 
 What about security? 
 Once you're in the room, you should be fine. 
 They leave their weapons here at the door out of respect for the occasion. 
 I'll let you know when the time is right, but how you get in, that is up to you. 
 You do your thing and get out fast. 
 I got to say, Charlie, you're really kicking the hornet's nest here. 
 I want to make things right, Eduardo, the money, everything. 
 Yeah. It's gonna be a room full of pissed off gypsies, who you work for. 
 My old boss wants me dead, my new one makes me wish I was. 
 I'm sure I'll be fine. 
 [Ringtone plays] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Sylvia, what the f*ck? 
 Wow. Morning to you, too. 
 Where are you? 
 In Vegas. With Terry. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Calm down. 
 We're just blowing off a little steam. 
 This guy is the luckiest f*ck I have ever seen. 
 I think we're up, like, $12,000. 
 Sylvia, get away from him right now. 
 Here we go. You gonna lecture me again about my choices in men? 
 No, it's not that. I don't work for Fonso anymore. 
 He wants me dead, so that pretty much puts you in the same category. 
 I can handle myself. 
 Listen to me, Terry is Fonso's hatchet man. 
 If he finds out... 
 Would you calm down? 
 The guy is harmless. 
 He's on a two-day bender. He can barely find the bathroom. 
 Plus, he told me something I think you should hear. 
 Last night, pai gow table, 4:00 A. M., the guy's coked out of his mind, pounding vodka tonics, and he starts running his mouth about Fonso. 
 How he treats him like sh1t, he's tired of cleaning up his messes, blah-blah. 
 That's when he brings up this storage shed. 
 Storage shed? 
 Yeah. 
 Some place Fonso keeps in Covina. 
 All kinds of sh1t in there, apparently. 
 I don't know. I just... I have a feeling there's something in there worth seeing. 
 I was supposed to be impressed. 
 Can you get me an address? 
 Probably. 
 Assuming he's not passed out at the blackjack table. 
 All right, do it and be careful. 
 Don't worry. I'll call you in a bit. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 We knew you didn't do this, honey. 
 Why would she want to kill Emma? 
 I don't know. 
 Police didn't say. 
 I'm sorry I let her into our home. 
 What you said yesterday was true. 
 I let something happen to you. 
 I have to live with that. 
 I won't let it happen again. 
 Your dad and I have a gig today. It's probably gonna go late. 
 I know. Dad told me. 
 I love you, Nick. 
 I know, Mom. 
 ♫♫ 
 My great-grandmother made this tazo. 
 The red symbolizes not only good fortune, but the pain and the blood and the suffering of our people. 
 Appropriate for the occasion. 
 What the f*ck is this? 
 Magic. 
 A little razzle-dazzle for our guests. 
 I had Charlie put it together for me. 
 Charlie? 
 What, is he here? 
 Not yet. 
 You invited gadje to my kid's wedding? 
 No. I hired him and his wife to be the entertainment. 
 And that's my right as father of the groom. 
 They don't belong. 
 Relax! 
 He knows the rules. 
 Okay, they're going to stay out of sight, they're not gonna mingle with the guests. 
 Nobody's even gonna know that they're here. 
 Am I right? 
 Absolutely. 
 f*ck the gadje, and f*ck this. 
 You know what? I'm not gonna let you do this. 
 This is a good day. 
 It's a joyful day. 
 And I'm gonna enjoy myself, whether you like it or not. 
 Lighten the f*ck up, man. 
 Fonso? 
 Fonso? 
 Not now, Ma. 
 The photographer is here. I want you to meet him. 
 Not now. 
 ♫♫ 
 [Thud] 
 [Hinges creak] 
 ♫ She said careful ♫ 
 ♫ Always careful ♫ 
 ♫ Stay close and stay prepared ♫ 
 ♫ One slip and you are theirs ♫ 
 ♫ You gotta walk ♫ 
 ♫ Walk on well-lighted streets ♫ 
 ♫ Walk on well-lighted streets ♫ 
 ♫ Walk on well-lighted streets ♫ 
 ♫ Look twice at everyone I meet ♫ 
 ♫♫ 
 Change of plans. 
 Ted, give us a minute. 
 We're not using the wedding cake as a second reveal anymore. 
 Why not? 
 I've got something better. 
 An insurance policy. 
 Something that puts Fonso right where we want him. 
 Jesus! 
 You want to get us killed? 
 Listen to me, all the problems we've had, all the sh1t we have been through, none of that matters right now. 
 This... this is our chance to get out. 
 You think you can do this? 
 I can. 
 I'm gonna change the rigging, and Ted's gonna help me. 
 What do you need from me? 
 Nothing changes. 
 Just be you. 
 ♫♫ 
 I don't need it to revolve, I just need it to have enough vibration to tip over once. 
 What's in the box? 
 Don't worry about it. How long? 
 Couple minutes. 
 You seen Fonso? 
 Not yet. 
 Poor kid. 
 He's as nervous as a gypsy boy on his wedding day. 
 [Chuckles] That's an expression, huh? 
 It is now. 
 What is he, like 12? 
 Give or take. 
 What the hell is wrong with you people?! 
 On behalf of the hotel, we are so sorry. 
 I specifically said rose! Not pink! 
 These are the rose ones. 
 Oh, are they?! 
 This looks like rose to you?! 
 Huh?! 
 No. 
 Change it. 
 Change it all! 
 [Speaking native language] 
 f*cking caterers. 
 And, of course, my husband had to go and add your little performance. 
 This thing gonna work? 
 I really hope so. 
 My husband's the best in the business. 
 He'd better be. 
 And remember, this is our wedding. 
 You're the help. So if you want to... eat or something, we'll set some plates up in the kitchen. 
 Paper? 
 No. 
 I'll bring out my good china for you. 
 All set. 
 You ready for the next part? 
 Got it right here. 
 Shall we? 
 Oh, I'm... I'm sorry to bother you. 
 It's happening again. 
 What... what is? 
 The lights, they... they keep clipping in and out. 
 I think it's an overload issue. Can you show me your subpanel? 
 The subpanel... it's the breaker box. 
 Oh, right, right, right. It's in the basement. 
 The keys are here somewhere. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 It's okay. 
 You need the lights right for the trick to work? 
 We sure do. It's gonna be a great show. 
 Oh, great. 
 Arranged marriages are the normal way in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Japan, and India, Bangladesh, among other places. 
 They're also called pragmatic marriages. 
 Up to 80% of them in Afghanistan are forced. 
 Even so, most of them are successful long-term relationships. 
 Statistically, they are more happy couples in arranged marriages than the free choice marriages we're more familiar with here in the United States. 
 You see? 
 Do you want to marry him, then? 
 No. That stuff he puts in his hair is gross. 
 I know you think that all these ways are wrong, they are archaic, but see, they can be happy marriages. 
 Mine was, mine was. 
 Your grandfather's hammer? 
 Oh, yes. 
 When I was little, it was on your nightstand. 
 I used to look at it, pretend I could hear horses. 
 Oh, you could hear horses. 
 My mother kept this hammer under pillow when her father died in a concentration camp. 
 And at night, sometimes she could hear horses. 
 You see, these archaic traditions, these superstitions, they are powerful and scary. 
 But they can also protect you. 
 Great. 
 There's no one here yet. 
 When has a gypsy ever been on time? 
 What if no one comes? 
 I sent the word out, they'll come. 
 But what if they don't? I'll look like an idiot. 
 More  of. You'll look like more of an idiot. 
 Really. What if no one comes? 
 Name me one person on your father's side who would turn down a free meal? Huh? 
 I don't know why they wouldn't just send out invitations like normal people. 
 Because we are better than normal people. 
 We're Roma. 
 Oh. 
 So handsome. 
 Hmm. 
 Is this your only breaker box? 
 Far as I know. 
 Yeah. That's weird. 
 None of them are tripped. 
 Kurt, you there? 
 Caterers need you in the kitchen. 
 Copy. 
 You good down here? 
 Yeah, go ahead. I got this. 
 [Pounding] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Pounding continues] 
 [Pounding intensifies] 
 Fonso's here. He's looking for you. 
 All right. Time to go see White Tony. 
 
 
 
 [Knock on door] 
 Come in! 
 May I? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I know this is a big day for your family, but I'm worried it's about to get ruined. 
 What's wrong? The trick? 
 Fonso... he's looking for Charlie. 
 I'm afraid he's gonna kill him. 
 Well, what else is new? 
 What's wrong with you? Come on? 
 I got 200 guests coming! 
 You're right. 
 We were running our own game. 
 I know that. I got eyes on you. 
 And I don't care about any of this old stuff. 
 Do you care about $1.7 million? 
 $1.7 million? 
 That's what we got, that's what Fonso took. 
 I want my husband protected. 
 What's this got to do with me? 
 Technically, that's your money. 
 Would you like me to explain? 
 Yeah, I'd like you to f*cking explain. 
 You didn't earn sh1t, you stole it from me! 
 From my gadjes, from my employees! 
 They stole it from me, you cocksucker! 
 Oh, I'm a cocksucker now?! 
 Yeah! 
 You fat f*cking clown! Meet me outside! 
 Meet me outside... 
 Bring it on, bitch! 
 Oh, here comes your mama. 
 Shh! 
 It's bad luck to fight... 
 Why don't you stay the f*ck out of this?! 
 Don't you speak to my mother like that, you piece of sh1t! 
 You want to screw with me, Fonso? 
 You want to screw with me? How about this? 
 You no longer have the honor of binding their wrists or doing the veil at the wedding. 
 Oh! It's ridiculous! 
 It is my right as father! 
 It's my right as father to decide who gets that honor and you no longer do it! 
 You humiliate my mother at our own wedding?! 
 Give me back my money, and maybe I'll reconsider. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Alfonso. 
 Yes, Ma? 
 We need to fix this. 
 ♫♫ 
 Josip, how are you? 
 Good baro, Peter. 
 How's your mother, feeling better? 
 She thanks you for the flowers. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Sasti masa. 
 Sasti masa. 
 You put that money into White Tony's head, didn't you? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 What are you really doing here? 
 Nothing. 
 You do one thing to ruin this day for me or my family, and you'll regret it. 
 Do you understand? 
 Rita! We need you! 
 Not right now. 
 Yes, now! They're having an emergency kris. 
 Where? 
 In the ballroom with Josip. 
 Bring the gadje, they're witnesses. 
 Come! 
 The gadje hatched a plan while they were in my employ, so that money is mine. 
 I swear on Saint Sarah these statements are true! 
 They hatched it in your employ, but then they called it off and they came up with a new plan! 
 They did not call it off! 
 They called it off, they came up with a new plan when they were working with me! 
 She told me! She told me! You want to ask her?! 
 When? When? 
 Just now! 
 She told me now in my f*cking dressing room! 
 Ask her, please. 
 This thing you did, would you say that it was consummated during the time you were in Fonso's employ? 
 Yes, it's true. I found the mark and did most of the legwork while working for Fonso. 
 But in the end, I didn't take her money. 
 sh1t. 
 Huh? I told you, man. 
 Why? 
 I didn't think it was right. 
 Give me a f*cking break. 
 I'm the one who came up with the plan after we were working for White Tony. 
 See, "working for White Tony"! 
 Okay, let's make this simple. 
 The kris was on a Monday night. 
 Yes, it was. 
 I awarded the gadje to you then. 
 Yes. 
 Exactly when did you obtain the money? 
 The next day. 
 Simple. 
 The money belongs to White Tony. 
 With Roma unity as my guiding principle, that is my decree. 
 And you must turn the money over now. 
 All debts must be settled before the wedding can occur. 
 You're taking the word of a gadji over me? 
 This is bullshit. 
 Fonso, we have to abide by the law, pay all debts. 
 We have no choice. 
 Okay, Mom. 
 I'll do it for you. 
 And for my family. 
 Do we need to count it? 
 Uh, no. No, I don't think so. 
 I mean, after all, we're almost family. 
 Right? 
 In fact, why don't you keep this? 
 To cover your share of the dargo. 
 It's a gesture of goodwill. 
 Whatever. 
 Let's do this. 
 Sir, I'm gonna need you to put in your code. 
 Don't pick your birthday. 
 My birthday? What do I look like, a f*cking idiot? 
 It's got an electronic lock, six digits. 
 Only you can open it after it's programmed. 
 [Groans] 
 [Safe door closes] 
 [Lock clicks] 
 Let the wedding begin. 
 ♫♫ 
 What the f*ck? 
 Simza's did the binding? 
 Yeah. And the veiling, too. 
 T, that's supposed to be Rita's honor. 
 Shut up and mind your own business. 
 Music! 
 ♫♫ 
 I remember when I wore my second dress. 
 The symbolism of belonging to a new family. 
 You're ours now. 
 Oh, Drina, would it kill you to just smile? 
 Be happy. 
 It's... it's romantic, like "Romeo and Juliet." 
 You know how that ends, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 ♫♫ 
 Charlie? 
 Charlie? 
 ♫♫ 
 You ready to do this? 
 Yeah. 
 Charlie? 
 I'm fine. 
 ♫♫ 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? 
 Come on, everybody. 
 Come on down to the stage, huh? 
 [Speaking native language] Come on. 
 You know, it wouldn't be a White Tony occasion if something special wasn't gonna happen. 
 Tony. 
 Thank you, Josip. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Now, to commemorate the union of these two very beautiful families, I have commissioned a magic trick that I know you're all gonna love. 
 So, without further ado, here we go! 
 [Applause] 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom! 
 [Applause] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Laughs] 
 How about that?! 
 That's unbelievable! 
 [Applause] 
 Hey, the best part's coming up. 
 I wonder where they went. 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 What the f*ck's this? 
 It's... it's a magic trick. 
 You said it was going to be a wedding cake. 
 What the f*ck's this? 
 I know. Just watch. 
 [Screaming, gasping] 
 Jesus Christ! 
 911. What is your emergency? 
 [Gasping] 
 Is that Cousin Lou? 
 Who the f*ck did this?! 
 Who the f*ck did this?! 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Screaming] 
 Greetings to all. 
 This ain't no magic trick. 
 This sh1t right here is f*cking real. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 You sure you know what you're doing? 
 What I'm doing? Yeah. I'm taking your f*cking watch. 
 Everybody, take off your sh1t! 
 Your jewelry, everything! 
 What's this here? Huh? 
 All right. Let's go, everybody, come on. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 I'm guessing that's not a compliment. 
 You ruined my son's wedding. I curse you and your family. 
 Yeah, well, I don't believe in curses anymore or Santa Claus or the moon landing. 
 Let's go! Take everything off. 
 Watch. Wallet. Put it in the bag. 
 Take off all your sh1t. 
 Let's go, come on, people. 
 That's a beautiful dress. 
 Give me the watch. 
 No. 
 Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. 
 Give me your watch. 
 Come and get it. 
 All right, tough guy. 
 I'm gonna ask you one more time. 
 Do I know you? 
 If we'd met, you'd remember. 
 Now, give me your motherfucking watch. 
 Thank you. 
 All right, everybody, thank you for your cooperation. 
 And to the bride, may it all be uphill from here. 
 Let's go. 
 ♫♫ 
 [Speaking native language] 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 Gadje. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Thud] 
 ♫♫ 
 [Siren continues] 
 Fonso?! 
 Drina?! 
 Fonso?! 
 Drina?! 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Singing in native language] 
 Ma'am? 
 Hands where I can see them. 
 Ma'am, I need to see your hands now! 
 Your grandmother did a bad, bad, bad thing. 
 Do I still have to get married? 
 Not today. 
 And when either of you do want to get hitched, it'll be your choice, on your terms, okay? 
 Because we are the Marks family. 
 We are [Speaking native language] 
 Nobody tells us what to do. 
 Not anymore. 
 The hammer belonged to her grandfather. 
 It was supposed to be gift for the bride. 
 Did she know the victim? 
 Yes. Very well. 
 I... I knew there was bad blood. 
 I didn't think it would come to this. 
 What kind of bad blood? 
 Family politics, financial issues. 
 She's a very proud woman, Rita, and she was humiliated earlier. 
 I suppose she snapped. 
 Everything's working out wonderfully. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Oh. Oh, yeah. 
 Yes, merry Christmas. Thanks again for the present. 
 Good night, Mr. Henderson, and merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Well? Nick? [Sighs] Check his room. Shall we? We did it. We f*cking did it. A car for you. A house for you. Oh, thank you. New life! New life! [Both laughing] Oh, my God! Oh. We f*cking did it. We did it, baby. Charlie? Charlie? Fonso. You took your time. I was cleaning my house. So what now? ♫♫
