 DUCKY: He's not an American Naval Officer? 
 GERALD: They said he was a Royal Navy Commander. 
 DUCKY: Well, which Royal Navy, Gerald? There are several of them. 
 GERALD: I assume British, Doc. 
 DUCKY: The Swedes, the Norwegians, Aussies, Kiwis, Saudis... they all have Royal Navies. 
 GERALD: Well, the EMT only said that the Embassy told them to bring him to NCIS for autopsy. 
 DUCKY: Which Embassy? 
 GERALD: Israeli. 
 DUCKY: Israeli? 
 GERALD: That's what they said. 
 DUCKY: Hmm. Why on earth would the Israeli Embassy send us a foreign naval officer? 
 GERALD: Well that's what I asked the EMT that delivered the body, but they didn't know either. 
 DUCKY: He calls me down here in the middle of the night, doesn't know which Navy. Gerald, what does this look like? 
 GERALD: Uh... one of my gloves. 
 DUCKY: What's it doing in my drawer? 
 GERALD: I'm sorry, Doc, I must have put your gloves in my drawer. I'll get it. 
 DUCKY: No, I'll do it. Ah, Gerald, unzip that body bag and find out with which Navy our guest sailed. 
 (GERALD UNZIPS THE BAG) 
 DUCKY: Don't recognize the uniform. I'm not surprised. The Royal Navies of the world wear almost identical uniforms. In fact, during World War Two, British Naval Officers whose ships went down in the channel, passed themselves off in Antwerp as German submariners who... good god.

 (SFX: GUNSHOT /GLASS BREAKS 
 GERALD: Sorry, Doc. 
 DUCKY: That's all right, Gerald. I looked at it too. 
 ARI: How do you alert visitors when conducting infectious autopsy? 
 DUCKY: We hang a decomposing body in the corridor. 
 ARI: A sense of humor under duress - that's an admirable quality, Doctor. However, when I ask a question, I want a truthful and immediate answer. So each time you lie, or I suspect you lie, I will put a nine millimeter, hollow point slug into one of your assistant's ball and socket joints. If you doubt me, I can demonstrate. 
 DUCKY: That won't be necessary. May I make a request? 
 ARI: You would rather I put the slug in you? 
 DUCKY: Yes. 
 ARI: I can't oblige. How do you alert people to infectious autopsies? 
 DUCKY: A lit red sign in the corridor. 
 ARI: Gerald, the sign, please. Just a moment. Also lock the doors and bring me a set of greens and breathing gear. 
 DUCKY: What is it you want? 
 ARI: In due time, Doctor...? 
 DUCKY: Mallard. 
 ARI: Like the famous English A-Four steam locomotive. 
 DUCKY: Most people think of waterfowl. 
 ARI: Ah, the Mallard ran from London to Edinburgh for decades. In nineteen thirty eight it attained a speed of over two hundred kilometers an hour. 
 DUCKY: Two hundred and two. 
 ARI: A world record. Although the Germans claimed it was set on a slight downgrade. Typical.

 TONY: You never had a nightmare? 
 KATE: Uh-uh. 
 TONY: Not even as a kid? 
 KATE: Nope. No fear of the dark or a boogie man in my closet. 
 TONY: Me either. But the vampire on the canopy of my bed freaked me. 
 KATE: You had a canopy bed? 
 TONY: I was five. My mother was into Louis the Fifteenth. It wasn't my call, Kate. 
 KATE: Does she still frighten you? 
 TONY: My mother? 
 KATE: The vampire. 
 TONY: What makes you think it was a "she?" 
 KATE: Vampires are seducers. Knowing you, Tony, it had to be female. 
 TONY: Well, she was after my blood, not the pride of my childhood. 
 KATE: You were proud at five? 
 (ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE CLOSED) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 TONY: She finished the story, tucked me in, blew out the candles. My mother thought that candlelight enhanced the trompe l'oieil. 
 KATE: Canopy beds, trompe l'oieil, flickering candles. No wonder your bete noir was a vampire. 
 TONY: Bete noir. Cute. 
 KATE: It goes with the Louis the Fifteenth bedroom. So... what would happen? 
 TONY: Forget it. 
 GIBBS: Forget what? 
 KATE: Oh, Tony's bete noir. 
 TONY: Ah, it's French for um... 
 GIBBS: Nightmare? I do crossword puzzles too, DiNozzo. 
 TONY: Actually my mother taught me nightmare in French... 
 GIBBS: Did your father teach you how to report? 
 TONY: Oh, yeah. During cocktail hour, while I was pouring his Macallan eighteen - three fingers, one ice cube - you know, I had to report in about my day at school and just give him sort of a... (BEAT) We bagged and tagged everything in Qassam's room. There wasn't much there. Koran. Prayer rug. Fast food wrappers. This guy took home from work and didn't empty his trash. He had sinus problems. Bad breath. 
 KATE: Yeah, probably because he didn't brush his teeth. There was no brush or toothpaste in his bathroom. 
 TONY: Just aspirin, sinus spray and breath freshener. 
 GIBBS: Did you swab for explosives. 
 TONY: Yeah. Top to bottom. Found minute traces of nitrate in the dresser table. Probably where he kept his Baretta. 
 GIBBS: Computer? 
 TONY: Not even a Gameboy, boss. 
 KATE: He didn't have a TV, Tony. 
 TONY: Gameboy is handheld, Kate. You're thinking about X-Boxes, PS Twos, GameCubes... 
 GIBBS: I'm thinking of kicking some ass. Gitmo intel said Qassam was to execute a terrorist attack on the Naval base at Norfolk. He's in no shape to tell us how or when... his computer might. 
 KATE: No computer. 
 GIBBS: What about the food court where he worked? 
 TONY: Ah, just a keyboard with pictures. Burgers, malts, fries. Not exactly cyberspace friendly, boss. 
 KATE: Hey, he could have used an internet café. I'll check Little Creek and his neighborhood. 
 GIBBS: I should have thought of that. 
 TONY: Well, you're more - you know, smurf than alpha geek. So am I, according to Agent McGee. 
 GIBBS: You're right, DiNozzo. 
 TONY: I am? 
 GIBBS: Hell, I still use a notebook and a pencil instead of a P-D-Q. 
 TONY: It's P-D-A. You can call it Palm Pilot. 
 GIBBS: It doesn't matter what I call it if I can't use it. 
 TONY: I'll teach you. 
 GIBBS: You'll teach me? McGee teaches you, you teach me. It's backwards! God, I need coffee. 
 KATE: What was that all about? 
 TONY: Gibbs bete noir.

 ARI: Right ventricle, left atria. You haven't done the autopsy. 
 DUCKY: It was late. I was due to autopsy today. 
 ARI: Then you best place him on the table. Did you draw blood last night? 
 DUCKY: Yes. 
 ARI: Is it refrigerated here? 
 DUCKY: No. 
 ARI: You sent it with his clothing to forensics? 
 DUCKY: Yes. Are you a pathologist? 
 ARI: Where is the lab? 
 GERALD: One floor up. Directly above us. 
 DUCKY: There's a stairwell outside to the left you can use. 
 ARI: Not the elevator? 
 DUCKY: I assumed you'd think that too risky. 
 ARI: Is it an emergency stairwell? 
 DUCKY: No. That would be alarmed. 
 ARI: Surveillance camera? 
 DUCKY: (BEAT) Yes. I answered promptly and I haven't lied! 
 ARI: You tried to trick me, Doctor Mallard. 
 DUCKY: That wasn't a condition.

 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Ducky, you're such a purist! 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (V.O.) What's up? 
 DUCKY: I need the evidence Gerald delivered last night. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Oh, good luck. I haven't even had my morning sprinkles yet. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: I didn't ask for the results. I need it all back, including the blood. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) What are you going to do with the blood? 
 DUCKY: (V.O.) Abby, just get it down here! 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Wow. Did you get up on the wrong side of the autopsy table? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: Sorry. I have a theory to test. 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) Want to share? 
 DUCKY: Not quite yet. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Okay. Send Gerald up. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: He's busy. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: (V.O.) You'll have to bring it down here. 
 (INTERCUT AUTOPSY SCENE) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Ducky, you know I can't do that. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: Abby, I don't have time to deal with your necrophobia. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) I am not necrophobic. Dead bodies don't freak me out. Autopsy does. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (V.O.) Ducky, please don't ask me to do this. 
 DUCKY: You won't have to enter Autopsy. In fact, you can't. We've opened an infectious body. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: (V.O.) Leave it at the door. 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) I can't even press the down button on the elevator any more! 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: Get Gibbs to do it. STAT!(END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 ARI: Am I to believe that? 
 DUCKY: Well Abby, who is unfazed by the most gruesome of forensics, recently had a nightmare. Since then, she has not set foot in autopsy. 
 ARI: Gerald, is that true? 
 GERALD: She hasn't been down for quite a while. 
 ARI: A code word could have triggered that absurd conversation. 
 DUCKY: Abby and I are not special agents. We're forensic scientists. We do not use code words. Surely you understand the power of phobias? 
 ARI: Butterflies. 
 DUCKY: Sorry. 
 ARI: I fear butterflies. 
 DUCKY: Good. Well, not good that you have a phobia, but good that you understand that not a word I said was coded to alert Abby. 
 ARI: Who is Gibbs? 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 FADE IN: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: Gibbs is the only other person Abby has told of her phobia. He's also the one person she'd turn to for help. 
 ARI: Is he a special agent? 
 DUCKY: Yes, but does that matter? Look, all I'm trying to do is to give you the evidence so you can do what you came here to do and leave.

 ARI: (V.O.) Have you worked with Doctor Mallard long, Gerald? 
 GERALD: A bit over two years. 
 ARI: Quick on his feet? 
 GERALD: He was a miler at Eton. Still recalls all of his races in great detail. 
 ARI: Your sense of humor seems to be contagious, Doctor Mallard. 
 DUCKY: No, I'm afraid Gerald took you literally. I have a way of going on about my salad days. He associates "quick on my feet" with my stories of the playing fields of Eton. 
 ARI: Do you believe Wellington actually said that? 
 DUCKY: Probably not. But most Etonians love to think he did. 
 ARI: Are you lost, Gerald? 
 GERALD: "The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton." 
 ARI: Very good. 
 GERALD: Stick around the Doc long enough and you pick up a lot of trivia. 
 ARI: Trivia? 
 GERALD: Much as I'd enjoy that, I have to decline. So you believe this... Abby was it? 
 GERALD: Abby Sciuto. 
 ARI: Abby Sciuto has really developed an autopsy phobia? 
 GERALD: Truthfully... 
 ARI: I think your shoulder would prefer that. 
 GERALD: I never figured anyone who slept in a coffin could have a phobia, but it's the kind of kinky thing Abby would get. 
 ARI: She slept in a coffin?

 ABBY: Where's Tony? 
 KATE: The head. What's wrong, Abby? 
 ABBY: Ducky needs all this evidence back in autopsy. 
 KATE: Before you've tested it? 
 ABBY: Yeah. 
 KATE: That's strange. 
 ABBY: Yeah. I can't go down to autopsy. 
 KATE: Why? 
 ABBY: I had this dream like a month ago and ever since then autopsy scares the hell out of me. 
 (KATE CHUCKLES) 
 ABBY: Why are you laughing? 
 KATE: Sorry. Sorry. I was um...I was just thinking of Tony. 
 ABBY: Tony's afraid of autopsy too? 
 KATE: No, he dreams of vampires. 
 ABBY: Oh. I dig vampire dreams. 
 KATE: Oh. Tony sure doesn't. 
 ABBY: Well that's silly. 
 KATE: But fear of going into autopsy which you've done your entire career isn't? 
 ABBY: Of course it is. It doesn't change anything. I can't even take the elevator to the basement anymore. 
 KATE: Wow! 
 ABBY: Yeah. 
 KATE: So do you want me to take this evidence down to Ducky? 
 ABBY: Would you? 
 KATE: Yeah, of course. 
 ABBY: Okay. You have to sign to maintain the chain of evidence. 
 KATE: Right. 
 ABBY: Oh, and um... Ducky's doing an infectious autopsy. 
 KATE: On who? The terrorist? 
 ABBY: I don't know. He just said to leave everything outside the door. 
 KATE: Well, Qassam is the only body in autopsy. Why would Ducky think he was infectious if you hadn't done a blood test?

 DUCKY: Oh, sorry! I didn't think. I always pick up my phone. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
 GIBBS: I thought the safest way to apprehend him was a routine trunk check at the Little Creek gate. The security guard opening his trunk had his weapon pulled. Qassam saw it in the side view mirror, realized the check was anything but routine... and when he-- 
 MORROW: Pulled his weapon, you had to take him down. 
 GIBBS: Yes, Sir. I gave him every chance.(ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN) 
 (MORROW AND GIBBS WALK DOWN THE STAIRS) 
 MORROW: I'll read all about it in your incident report, Jethro. What I'm interested in at the moment is how a terrorist got a job on the base? 
 GIBBS: Fast food workers are vetted by their employers. 
 MORROW: Unbelievable. What was he planning on doing, besides serving burgers and fries? 
 GIBBS: I have no idea, Sir. I was hoping to get some help from Gitmo or Bahrain on that.

 CASSIDY: (V.O.) Qassam's passport, student visa and social security card were all forged in Mexico. (ON SCREEN) Same errors as papers on an Al Qaeda we caught at the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CONFERENCE CALL) 
 SNYDER: (ON SCREEN) Getting forged documents in Mexico doesn't make him Al Qaeda. 
 CASSIDY: (ON SCREEN) I got the lead on Qassam from an Al Qaeda detainee. 
 MORROW: Why don't you think he's Al Qaeda, Agent Snyder? 
 SNYDER: 
 SNYDER: 
 (ON SCREEN) Yasir Qassam was born in the Gaza Strip. (V.O.) His parents were killed during the Second Intifada when their home was shelled. (ON SCREEN) His brother Saleem was recruited by Hamas as a shahid - a suicide bomber. (V.O.) This tape aired on Al Jazeera after Saleem blew himself up along with nine Israeli civilians on a bus in Jerusalem. (ON SCREEN) Saleem's reciting the usual martyr rhetoric, but he dedicates (V.O.) his death to avenge the blood of his father and mother. 
 (CONT.) I believe Yasir used his real name on forged documents (ON SCREEN) because he was a Hamas shahida like his brother. 
 SNYDER: (ON SCREEN) Maybe he wanted to make sure that he got the seventy virgins instead of some Muslim with an alias he used. 
 GIBBS: Shahidas are like our sport stars to Palestinian kids. Qassam could have used his real name to be famous in Gaza. 
 SNYDER: (ON SCREEN) Exactly. It doesn't make sense that he would die on an Al Qaeda mission in the States. He'd want to kill Israelis. 
 MORROW: Hamas or Al Qaeda, what was he trying to do? 
 CASSIDY: (ON SCREEN) All I know is that Qassam was key to a planned suicide mission at Norfolk. 
 SNYDER: (ON SCREEN) I've nothing to add, Director. 
 MORROW: Think of` something.(END VIDEO CONFERENCE CALL) 
 MORROW: Well? 
 GIBBS: Daniel Snyder's a good agent, sir. I'd trust his instincts. 
 MORROW: Hamas has never attacked targets on U.S. soil for fear of losing financial support from pro-Arab Americans. 
 GIBBS: How can you support any group that lets their children blow themselves up? 
 MORROW: Their leaders say that the suicide bomb is all they have to fight with. 
 GIBBS: Sir, when Hamas leaders start blowing themselves up, I'll consider it. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 ABBY: There's a way to overcome this. Really? How? Group therapy. Oh, how many people have a fear of autopsy? You're going to be a group of one! Lots of people wouldn't be caught dead in an autopsy room. Very funny. Maybe hypnotism. Ooh, remember Doctor Wertzer's class? You still don't know what he made you do when you were under hypnosis. Whatever it was, I woke up feeling refreshed...in his office a day later. 
 GIBBS: Abby? 
 ABBY: Yes? 
 GIBBS: What are you doing? 
 ABBY: I was having an internal debate. 
 GIBBS: Mmm. Who's winning? 
 ABBY: I'm not sure. Oh, hell. The phobic side. 
 GIBBS: Still can't enter autopsy? 
 ABBY: No. 
 GIBBS: Did you find any tag traces of explosives on the terrorist's clothes? 
 ABBY: Ducky took everything back before I had a chance to test it. 
 GIBBS: What? 
 ABBY: Don't look at me! He wouldn't say why. He just wanted everything back including the blood. 
 GIBBS: Including the blood? 
 ABBY: Yeah, it was a bit weird. There's no way to do a blood test in autopsy. 
 GIBBS: Did Gerald pick it up? 
 ABBY: Gerald was busy. Ducky just wanted me down there STAT. 
 GIBBS: STAT? 
 ABBY: Yeah. And I wouldn't go so Kate took it down. 
 TONY: Hey boss. What's up, Abs? 
 ABBY: Something's... 
 TONY: Hinky? 
 GIBBS: Tony, get autopsy on the plasma. 
 TONY: Huh? 
 GIBBS: Autopsy. TV. Now! Why would Ducky say STAT? 
 ABBY: Because he's a doctor? And because STAT means fast and a medical emergency? 
 GIBBS: (OVERLAP) Medical emergency. But what is a medical emergency in autopsy?

 KATE: How's he doing? 
 GERALD: I'm fine. 
 KATE: The bleeding stopped. That's good. 
 ARI: Yes, and no. Correct, Doctor Mallard? 
 DUCKY: I had to clamp his axillary artery to stop it. 
 ARI: Which means Gerald will lose his arm if the artery isn't repaired and the blood flow restored soon. 
 KATE: Ducky, can't you do that? 
 DUCKY: This is an autopsy room, not an ER. No, I can't. I'm sorry. He's going to need a fully equipped room and staff. 
 ARI: Which he will get as soon as I'm out of here. So where is the evidence collected in Qassam's room? 
 KATE: The lock-up. 
 ARI: Which is? 
 KATE: In the garage, one floor up. 
 ARI: The same way I came in. 
 KATE: I don't know how you came in. 
 ARI: In a body bag. 
 KATE: Same way you're going out. 
 ARI: Is it the same garage? 
 DUCKY: No. The evidence locker is in the garage next to forensics. Above us.

 (SFX: WARNING BUZZER IN CORRIDOR) 
 ARI: Now, please. Soon they'll be calling to negotiate your release. 
 KATE: We don't negotiate with terrorists. 
 ARI: Caitlin, when you get to know me better, you won't call me that. 
 KATE: I have no intention of getting to know you better. 
 ARI: Are you sure?

 (SFX: WARNING BUZZER B.G.) 
 GIBBS: Special Agent Gibbs. 
 HOROWITZ: H-R-T Leader Horowitz. What do you got, Gibbs? 
 GIBBS: A terrorist is holding three of our people hostage in autopsy. One of the hostages is wounded. We're here. This is autopsy. There are three exits: elevator, staircase, receiving. I have special agents at all three and they're on TAC-one. 
 HOROWITZ: Team one - elevator. Team two - stairway. Three - receiving. 
 GIBBS: (INTO RADIO/OVERLAP) Balboa, bring the elevator to level three for H-R-T. Pacci, DiNozzo, replacements are on the way. Stairwell and elevators on the other side of the staircase. Your Team Three will have to access receiving from the alley. 
 HOROWITZ: Okay, let's hit it, gentlemen! Let's move! 
 GIBBS: Hang on a second. Those hostages are our people. I'm in charge here. Understood? 
 HOROWITZ: Understood. Let's move out!

 MORROW: This is a video frame of the man holding our people hostage.(BEGIN VIDEO CONFERENCE CALL) 
 CASSIDY: (ON SCREEN) Nice smile. 
 MORROW: I'm sure. Do you recognize him? 
 CASSIDY: (ON SCREEN) I just meant that I would remember it, Sir, and I don't. The detainee who gave up Qassam may be able to identify him. 
 SNYDER: (ON SCREEN) I'm sorry, Director, I was on with Tel Aviv. Did Qassam work at Little Creek? 
 MORROW: He did. 
 SNYDER: (ON SCREEN) There's our Hamas connection. The Israelis are training at Little Creek on Hurricane boats. 
 GIBBS: I should have known that, Sir. 
 MORROW: See if Tel Aviv can identify him. Apparently our hostage taker is Hamas, but what's he after? 
 ARKIN: Negotiator Arkin, Director. If you'll open up a phone line to him, I'll find out. 
 GIBBS: I already know, Sir. He's here to retrieve Qassam's body and blood. 
 MORROW: Blood? 
 GIBBS: Hamas doesn't want us to know they had an infected terrorist serving burgers and fries to American and Israeli sailors. 
 MORROW: Get me CDC. Infected with what?

 INT. NCIS GARAGE - DAY 
 (ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE OPEN) 
 ABBY: Typhoid, anthrax, small pox - it could be any number of diseases with high morbidity. 
 TONY: (OVERLAP) Kate and I have been exposed. 
 GIBBS: Maybe not. 
 TONY: I need all the evidence I signed in this morning, Charlie. 
 CHARLIE: What? 
 TONY: (LOUDLY) The evidence I signed in now! (TO GIBBS) Why haven't we been exposed? 
 GIBBS: If Qassam was infectious, the attack would have been successful. No need to send a cleaner to keep us from finding out. 
 TONY: Maybe they wanted to delay our isolating exposed sailors to induce an epidemic. 
 ABBY: So sick. Well it is! 
 CHARLIE: One of you has to sign for that! 
 TONY: Don't wash. 
 GIBBS: Sorry. There's two more. Qassam would not have infected himself until he got a job on base. He would have carried the virus in something that's here. 
 ABBY: How long was Qassam slinging burgers? 
 TONY: Eight days. 
 ABBY: That's good news. Usually it takes longer than that to become infectious. 
 TONY: Usually? 
 ABBY: Okay, I'm going to start testing. 
 GIBBS: Not until we get duplicates to give him. I'm not giving him the virus back. 
 ABBY: Well, the pharmacy will have the aspirin, and nasal spray, the breath freshener, and the nearest place to get the tea... would be... The Tea Peddler. Two seven eight eight Connecticut Avenue. Now can I get started? 
 (ABBY WALKS O.S.) 
 GIBBS: How long do you think it would have taken me to find the nearest tea shop? 
 TONY: An hour sooner than me.

 DUCKY: (WHISPERS) Kate, no! He wants you to try. 
 KATE: Doctor Mallard thinks you were daring me to pick up this knife. 
 ARI: The proper term is a dissecting tool. 
 KATE: You didn't answer my question! You just wanted another excuse to shoot Gerald, didn't you! 
 (ARI HITS KATE) 
 ARI: (laughs) I have no intention of shooting Gerald again, Caitlin. I did, however, want to see if I was right about you. 
 KATE: Next time I'll be quicker. 
 ARI: Oh, don't you wonder why you weren't now? 
 DUCKY: Uh, could you give me a go? 
 ARI: I think not, Doctor. You would kill me without hesitation. I do, however, think you would regret it. Now, we have work to do if we're all to survive this day.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 (DOORS SLIDE OPEN) 
 TONY: Got it all bagged and tagged, boss. Aspirin, breath freshener, nasal spray, and tea. Qassam drank a wimpy Darjeeling from northwestern Kashmir. I prefer the darker, more robust flavor of tea from the brahmaputra area in northeast India where they actually take the leaf and they rake it... 
 GIBBS: Tony. 
 TONY: Yeah, boss? 
 GIBBS: You nervous? 
 TONY: Yeah. I don't like you going down there unarmed and solo. 
 GIBBS: No choice. Besides, I need you outside receiving. Team one. Gibbs. Elevator to level three. 
 TONY: By the time we get down from receiving, it'll be over. 
 GIBBS: This guy's not a suicide bomber. He has an escape plan. Maybe to get out the same way he came in. I want someone I know there. 
 TONY: That's the same as saying someone you trust. Someone you can depend on. 
 (ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE OPEN) 
 ABBY: I tested everything. The nasal spray was the only viral container. 
 GIBBS: Thanks, Abs. 
 TONY: Your best man!? 
 (ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE SHUT) 
 TONY: I don't think best man was the right thing to say to someone who has been married thrice.

 GIBBS: Where are the other hostages? 
 ARI: Box on the floor. Hands on top of your head, turn around, and walk back to the door. 
 GIBBS: Not without Gerald. 
 ARI: He won't leave here at all unless you put the box on the floor, your hands on your head, turn around. 
 GIBBS: (OVERLAP) Turn around and walk back to the door. Older doesn't mean deaf. You want out of here alive? 
 ARI: I'm sure Gerald does. 
 GIBBS: I think you do, too. That's why very slowly now I'm going to reach into this box and take out of here with two fingers exactly what you want.

 GIBBS: Oh, I don't know. 
 ARI: You measured it for your incident report. 
 GIBBS: Thirty seven feet and a few inches, give or take. 
 ARI: Oh, you're a very good shot. 
 GIBBS: I would love to demonstrate. 
 ARI: Funny. Special Agent Todd said the same thing. 
 GIBBS: Where is she? And the doctor? 
 ARI: Would you truly like to demonstrate? 
 GIBBS: Yep. 
 ARI: Agent Todd's Sig Sauer is in the box to your left. The clip is from the Sig Sauer. Untampered. All live rounds. (PAUSE) Pick it up.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 TONY: Well, you were right, boss. He had an accomplice in H.R.T gear inside the receiving elevator. Shot both the H.R.T guys before I nailed him. One of them's dead. The other's going to make it. 
 GIBBS: Where are Kate and Ducky? 
 TONY: Right here. He had them in the body drawer. 
 HOROWITZ: How'd you get him, Gibbs? 
 (GIBBS TURNS OVER THE BODY) 
 GIBBS: I didn't. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 TONY: The way he escaped was always his back up plan. He just needed someone he could count on to shoot him in the chest to trigger the assault. Gibbs figures he was wearing a bullet proof vest all along. 
 KATE: He was. I felt it. 
 TONY: You felt it? Well, how close did you get to feel it? Close enough to touch him. With your hands or did you touch him with...? 
 KATE: Close enough to stab him with the knife in my hand. 
 TONY: And you didn't. 
 KATE: No. 
 TONY: Stockholm Syndrome? 
 KATE: You can't identify with your captor in an hour. 
 TONY: Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's like falling in love. That can happen... like that.
