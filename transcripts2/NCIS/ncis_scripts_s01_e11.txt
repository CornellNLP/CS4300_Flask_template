 BEN: I've got ten minutes before Ainsley comes looking for me, so what's the big emergency? 
 JEREMY: No one can know about this. 
 BEN: Okay. 
 JEREMY: We haven't got much time. I was repositioning from Cuba up towards Quebec, guess it hit a glitch over Virginia - Little Creek Naval Base... 
 BEN: (SIGHS) God bless America. 
 JEREMY: She's really cold. 
 BENJAMIN: Really. Cold. 
 JEREMY: Better than monitoring ship movements in the Atlantic. 
 BEN: As long as we don't get caught. 
 JEREMY: Uh-oh. A problem. 
 BEN: Someone else must be there. Damn. Oh, no no no, sweetie. Nobody's looking. All right. All right. Where'd she go?

 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 "EYE SPY"(ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE OPEN) 
 TONY: (MUMBLES) Good morning, Kate. 
 KATE: I assume that was good morning. 
 TONY: (MUMBLES re DOUGHNUT) Want one? 
 KATE: No. Thanks. 
 TONY: (MUMBLES) Really good. 
 KATE: Not worth the price. I like keeping my belt notched exactly where it is. 
 TONY: What's that supposed to mean? 
 KATE: What mean? 
 TONY: The whole sort of raised eyebrows winky thing. 
 KATE: Nothing, really. Just a...a nervous tic. 
 TONY: I've weighed exactly the same since the day I graduated from college. Never up, never down. 
 KATE: Certainly you would know. Do you weigh yourself a lot? 
 TONY: I never weigh myself. 
 KATE: I see. Huh. I don't pay that close attention to your body, Tony. 
 TONY: Really? 
 KATE: But Tony, If you're happy with the way you are, that's all that counts. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Gibbs. Mm-hmm. 
 (GIBBS HANGS UP THE PHONE) 
 GIBBS: We've got a murder at Little Creek. Get Ducky.(GIBBS WALKS O.S.) 
 KATE: Are you all right? 
 TONY: Couldn't be better. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. BEACH - DAY 
 GIBBS: Who found the body? 
 ROE: I did. An anonymous tip was called into Base Security saying someone was stabbed here. 
 GIBBS: Victim been ID'd? 
 ROE: Yes, Sir. Lieutenant Commander Thomas Egan. His wallet was found in the S-U-V. 
 GIBBS: Kate, photos. 
 KATE: Got it. 
 TONY: Tag Heuer. You don't leave one of those around if you're robbing a guy. 
 GIBBS: You know the Lieutenant Commander's assignment? 
 ROE: Yes, Sir. He's attached as a technical advisor to Side-Scan, a civilian contractor on the base. Don't know any more. Their work's classified. 
 GIBBS: Keep this under wraps, Master Chief. 
 ROE: Yes, Sir. 
 (SFX: WAVES B.G.) 
 DUCKY: We have a rising tide. 
 GIBBS: Okay. DiNozzo? 
 TONY: Yo! 
 GIBBS: You and me take measurements. We'll rebuild them later in the lab. Kate, more photos! 
 KATE: Gotcha. 
 GIBBS: Gerald, take notes. 
 GERALD: I'm on it. 
 GIBBS: Come on, move it! 
 DUCKY: We've got to keep him dry. 
 GIBBS: I've got the sign. 
 TONY: I've got the farthest boulder. 
 GIBBS: Head and feet! 
 TONY: Fifteen point seven one. 
 GIBBS: Eleven point three six meters. 
 GERALD: Fifteen point seven one. Eleven point three six. Got them. 
 KATE: His dive knife is missing. 
 DUCKY: Yeah, you didn't see this coming, did you, my friend? 
 (SFX: WAVE B.G.) 
 GIBBS: Hey, watch out! Tide! 
 (TONY DIVES ONTO THE SAND) 
 DUCKY: (CHUCKLES) Well done, Tony. 
 GIBBS: Bag him. 
 DUCKY: I've got a spare suit in the van. 
 KATE: Are you okay? What is it? 
 GIBBS: Shrinkage.(KATE LAUGHS) 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. BUILDING - DAY 
 TYLER: I just can't believe Tom Egan is dead. 
 GIBBS: When did you see him last? 
 OVERMEYER: Early this morning. 
 GIBBS: Where was the Commander going? 
 TYLER: To conduct underwater tests on a piece of equipment. 
 OVERMEYER: Did you find a device with his body? 
 KATE: What kind of a device? 
 OVERMEYER: It's a handheld sonar gun. I've got a wooden mockup of the prototype that we're missing. It uses sound echoes to create visual images. 
 KATE: Like a sonogram. 
 OVERMEYER: Yeah. 
 TYLER: Not dissimilar. Earlier types are larger, have to be towed behind water craft. 
 OVERMEYER: And our version can be carried by a diver. My company developed the concept; we brought it to the Navy. Commander Tyler was assigned as my liaison. 
 TYLER: I brought in Tom. He was a sound-surveillance expert. We were evaluating it. 
 GIBBS: For use in harbor surveillance. 
 OVERMEYER: Yes. It's the only working prototype that we have. Its loss is just devastating to the military. 
 GIBBS: And I bet to your company. Where's the Commander's desk? 
 TYLER: There. 
 GIBBS: We're seizing his computer, and anything else we find we need. You understand. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. QUARTER DECK - DAY 
 SPARKS: (INTO PHONE) Little Creek Quarter Deck. This is Seaman Apprentice Sparks speaking. How may I help you, Sir, Ma'am? Yes, Sir. 
 TONY: Special Agent DiNozzo. 
 SPARKS: They just can't stop messing with the uniforms, can they, Sir? 
 TONY: You on duty this morning? 
 SPARKS: Yes, Sir. 
 TONY: You take the call about the attack on the beach? 
 SPARKS: Yes, Sir. Call came in at zero nine thirty two. 
 TONY: Get a name? 
 SPARKS: No, Sir. But the voice was male. Sounded real nervous. And when I started asking questions, he just hung up. 
 TONY: You have caller I.D. 
 SPARKS: Yes, Sir. But the call that came in this morning was blocked. 
 TONY: Well, it shouldn't be too hard for NCIS to trace that. 
 SPARKS: I'd write a letter, Sir. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. OFFICE - DAY 
 TONY: Come on! Come on, Magee! You said you could do this. 
 MAGEE: I didn't say it was going to be easy. 
 TONY: Actually, that's exactly what you said only on the phone you ended it with a Sir. 
 MAGEE: Well, that's when I thought you were talking about going through the proper channels. 
 TONY: Proper channels have too many bags. 
 MAGEE: Well, lucky for you Little Creek has its own central exchange. Otherwise the proper channels would be our only option. 
 TONY: If I'm so lucky, then why haven't you given me the number yet? 
 MAGEE: The exchange handles all incoming calls to the base. Do you have any idea how many calls came into Little Creek at zero nine thirty two? 
 TONY: You know what my dad always said about excuses? 
 MAGEE: Yeah, they're like armpits. Everyone has them and they all stink. 
 TONY: Actually, he used a different part of the anatomy, but you got the main idea. So whatever happened between you and Abby? 
 MAGEE: Our paths still cross on occasion. 
 TONY: Really? I guess the tat on the old caboose did the trick. 
 MAGEE: Among other things. 
 TONY: You don't say. Did you see any art on her caboose? 
 MAGEE: You're right, I don't say. 
 TONY: I'll take that as a no. 
 MAGEE: Ah, found it. You see, the new S-S-seven data circuits - they block display of the number. But the calling party number message is still carried on the line. 
 TONY: I don't know what you just said. I don't care what you just said. Just give me the number. Why is there an asterisk? 
 MAGEE: I'm not sure. (BEAT) Sir? 
 TONY: That wasn't an "at it, Sir," look. That was a "you'd better find out why," look. 
 MAGEE: Oh. Sorry. 
 TONY: Rookie mistakes. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. EGAN RESIDENCE - DAY 
 (CAR BRAKES TO A STOP) 
 KATE: Egan and his wife have been married for nine years. They met when they were stationed in San Diego. 
 GIBBS: Any kids? 
 KATE: No. Oh, my god! It's their anniversary next week. It looks like the Navy was pretty good about stationing them at the same bases. 
 GIBBS: How long have they been here in Little Creek? 
 KATE: Egan was transferred here in March and his wife had to finish assignment in Panama City, Florida. Then followed four months later. 
 GIBBS: No matter how many times I do this, it never gets any easier. 
 KATE: We should have had DiNozzo handle this interview. 
 (SFX: DOOR BELL RINGS) 
 KATE: Just kidding! 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 GIBBS: Lieutenant Egan? NCIS. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
 GIBBS: I'm aware there's probably a better time to be doing all this. 
 KATE: Where were you coming home from, Lieutenant? 
 EGAN: Camp Lejeune for the weekend. It was a human resources seminar. When I got home the Base Commander and the Chaplain were here and I knew... 
 GIBBS: When was the last time you spoke to your husband? 
 EGAN: Last night. 
 GIBBS: What time? 
 EGAN: (SOBS) I don't know. 
 GIBBS: Yeah, but if you could try to remember. 
 EGAN: (CRIES) I don't know! 
 GIBBS: Lieutenant, I know this is hard. 
 EGAN: (CRIES) Sorry! Around ten...before I went to bed. 
 KATE: Did you know that he was going diving today? 
 EGAN: But he went diving many times during the week. He was a SEAL. He was decorated. 
 GIBBS: Did he tell you what he was working on? 
 EGAN: No, Tom was very strict about need-to-know. He didn't discuss his work with anyone. Not even me. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: Would you do the honors, please, Gerald? 
 GERALD: Sure thing. 
 DUCKY: (BEAT) What? 
 GERALD: It moved. 
 DUCKY: (CHUCKLES) I don't think so. 
 GERALD: It moved, Doc. 
 DUCKY: Remind me to check our inventory of alcohol swab. (LONG BEAT) He certainly was dead on the beach. 
 (DUCKY UNZIPS THE BODY BAG) 
 DUCKY: Ooh! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. BASE DOCK - DAY 
 GIBBS: What do you think, Kate? Espionage?(TRUCK DOOR CLOSES) 
 KATE: A Navy specialist is murdered and the classified device he has with him is missing. It looks that way. 
 GIBBS: Yeah. 
 KATE: Oh, my god. 
 TONY: Don't even, okay? 
 KATE: Did I say anything? 
 TONY: You were. I know you were. 
 KATE: It's a touch small, but other than that it's fine. And the bonus, no belt. 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo. The anonymous tip? 
 TONY: It came from a restricted phone. Area code seven zero three. 
 KATE: Langley, Virginia. 
 GIBBS: CIA. 
 TONY: Wow, huh? 
 GIBBS: Yeah. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 MUSIC IN: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: It's okay. I got it, Tony. Don't you worry. Wouldn't want to disturb your lunch. 
 TONY: You got me thinking, Kate. Maybe I should improve my diet. 
 KATE: When are you going to start? 
 TONY: What do you call this? 
 KATE: Bad things masquerading as something good for you? 
 TONY: This is a nutrition bar. It says so on the label. 
 KATE: Did you read the label? The little one with the ingredients not just the big one with the pretty colors? 
 TONY: Oh, sarcasm is so not healthy, Kate. 
 KATE: Neither is that. Let's see... we've got here, (READS) High fructose corn syrup - basically sugar; uh... high maltose corn syrup - another sugar; sugar - sugar; fractionated palm kernel oil. That sounds yummy! And contains less than two percent natural flavor. That would make it ninety eight percent artificial flavor. 
 TONY: What are you saying? 
 ABBY: So I hear Egan's computer is waiting to get up close and personal with me. 
 KATE: Be gentle. I'm sure Tony will be more than happy to lug this downstairs for you. He's feeling healthy today. 
 TONY: No problem. 
 ABBY: Thanks, Tony. Where's Gibbs? 
 KATE: With Director Morrow. He's trying to get a meeting with the CIA. 
 ABBY: Ooh. Why? 
 KATE: That's where the anonymous phone call came from. 
 ABBY: Langley is like two hundred miles from Little Creek. Doesn't make any sense. 
 TONY: Especially considering Ducky established time of death as approximately nine thirty. And the tip was phoned in at nine thirty two. 
 ABBY: It's impossible. 
 GIBBS: It isn't if someone from the CIA was watching on a high-def satellite. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. ROBER'S OFFICE - DAY 
 ROBER: (V.O.) You're accusing the Agency of spying on a U.S. Naval Station. 
 GIBBS: Do you have a better explanation? 
 ROBER: It didn't happen, Agent Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: I have a dead Lieutenant Commander and missing classified hardware and a phone call that originated from this building right after the murder. 
 ROBER: I'm not denying we have the capability. But you know as well as I do that it would be a violation of CIA mandate to operate domestically. 
 GIBBS: Right. You never do anything illegal? We have the same Uncle writing our paychecks. We do what we do to get the job done. 
 ROBER: I appreciate the sentiment, Agent Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: I don't have a need-to-know to know why you have a satellite pointed at Little Creek. I have a murder to solve. I could use your help. 
 ROBER: There's nothing I can do to help you, Agent Gibbs. If you'll excuse me.

 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) You're on the air! 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) Hey, Ab. 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Gibbs, how did we do with the moles?(BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS)

 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Spooks, Abby. Spooks.

 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) I can never get that straight. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Are you still in touch with the old NASA boyfriend? 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) He wasn't a boyfriend. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) He was a boy-toy. And yes, we I-M almost every day. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) You do? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Oh yeah. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) That's good, right? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) It's very good. Why? 
 (END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. MTAC ROOM - DAY 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Greetings from NASA, NCIS. 
 ABBY: Whoa, Ashton, that was so Star Trek. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Sorry I'm late. I had a cluster of frozen reactor coolant heading for the flight path of an Atlas lift-off. I had to delay the launch. They were not happy about it. I am, however, very happy to see you, Abby, and to help your NCIS crime-fighting colleagues. 
 ABBY: Ah, you're the best, Ashton! 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Oh, you are, Ab. 
 ABBY: Thank you. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) We really should talk. 
 ABBY: We really should talk. 
 GIBBS: Special Agent Gibbs here. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Of course. 
 GIBBS: I appreciate your help. We're looking for SAT activity yesterday about zero nine thirty Eastern Standard. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Roger that. Geostationary? 
 ABBY: Asynchronous. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Multi-positional. 
 ABBY: Very. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Landstat seven? 
 ABBY: Think CIA. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Ah, K-H-twelve. 
 ABBY: Improved crystals. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Thermal infrared. 
 ABBY: It gets hot down here. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Target area? 
 ABBY: Virginia Coast. 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) We have entry. 
 ABBY: Oh, you're so good, Ashton. 
 GIBBS: Any idea what department it came from? 
 ASHTON KUGEL: Oh, pretty sophisticated blocking system on the K-H-twelve. I'm afraid that task is a bit more complicated. Complicated, but not impossible. They overlooked the same technology on the Milstar satellite relays and...that particular satellite is controlled from building thirty-five-C, office four-oh-nine. 
 ABBY: Bravo, Ashton!(END TELEPHONE CONVERSATION) 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS SEDAN - NIGHT 
 KATE: We're lucky Abby could get in the system and pull his name off the office number. There's not much on him. 
 GIBBS: CIA's not big on bios. 
 KATE: Jeremy Wirth....twenty-three... current address, thirty-five B Maple, Georgetown. Graduated M-I-T at twenty. 
 GIBBS: I'm impressed. 
 KATE: Been with the Agency six months... working as a satellite analyst. That's all we got. 
 GIBBS: Why would they use someone so green on such a covert assignment? 
 KATE: Too bad we don't have a photo. 
 GIBBS: Don't need one. He'll fit the profile. 
 KATE: I think geeky, right? 
 GIBBS: Well yeah, Kate, something like that. 
 KATE: Ha! Have you ever seen Robert Redford in Three Days of the Condor? 
 GIBBS: Yes. 
 KATE: That's a geek I could get covert with. 
 GIBBS: Kate, I would not get my hopes up. Check it out. (CHUCKLES) 
 (CAR DOOR OPENS/CLOSES) 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
 KATE: Jeremy? 
 JEREMY: Do I know you? 
 KATE: My name's Kate. Kate Todd. Can I talk to you? 
 JEREMY: About what? What's NCIS? 
 KATE: Naval Criminal Investigative Service. 
 JEREMY: I've got nothing to talk to you about. 
 GIBBS: I'm Special Agent Gibbs. Same agency you haven't heard of before. Only I don't take it personally anymore. 
 JEREMY: I've got to go inside. 
 KATE: We know where you work, Jeremy. We suspect you're the one that called Little Creek about the stabbing. You need to tell us what you saw. 
 JEREMY: I can't say anything. 
 GIBBS: Did the Assistant Director Rober have a little chat with you? 
 JEREMY: He put me on administrative leave. I'm under investigation. 
 KATE: Rober didn't know. 
 GIBBS: No. (TO JEREMY) You were using the satellite without their knowledge. Why were you watching Lieutenant Commander Egan? 
 JEREMY: Who? 
 KATE: The Naval officer who was murdered. 
 GIBBS: You play ball with me, I can square it with Rober. 
 JEREMY: You can do that? 
 KATE: With the exception of finding a decent barber, Gibbs can do pretty much anything he says he can. 
 JEREMY: I was watching...not watching... I wasn't watching the guy in the wetsuit. I was watching something else and happened to notice activity at the edge of the screen. 
 GIBBS: What kind of something else would this be? 
 JEREMY: A person. 
 GIBBS: Female person? 
 JEREMY: Yeah. 
 GIBBS: Kind of a babe female person? 
 JEREMY: Really hot. I stumbled across her by accident. She was polar tanning. 
 KATE: Nude winter sunbathing. 
 GIBBS: Must get cold. 
 JEREMY: Oh, she was Sir. 
 KATE: And you think that's an appropriate use for a billion dollar satellite, Jeremy? 
 JEREMY: I got a little off track with my priorities. 
 GIBBS: That happens with hot babes sometimes. So you didn't see who attacked Commander Egan? 
 JEREMY: When I tried to go close, the image pixilated. All I saw was him go down. Whoever it was ran off before I could adjust the picture. 
 GIBBS: And that's it? 
 JEREMY: If I had access to the Agency's computer, I could show you exactly what I saw. All satellite transmissions are recorded on a hard drive at Langley.

 ROBER: (INTO PHONE) I don't know what you're talking about. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Well, let me put Mister Wirth on. He can explain it to you. 
 JEREMY: (WHISPERS) Oh no, no! No! 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Your analyst... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) ....was spying on a U.S. Naval base. 
 ROBER: (INTO PHONE) You have Wirth? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) I'm not sure what Congressional oversight committee he's going to be spilling his guts to. I mean, there are so many... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED)....to choose from these days. 
 ROBER: (INTO PHONE) How do we handle this?

 (END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: Commander, based on the width and the jagged lower edge of the entry wound... it appears you were stabbed with your own knife. The wound is consistent with a serrated, titanium beta alloy knife missing from your sheath. Let's see what we've got here. Oh, seven inches. Well, Gerald, what have we learned form this? 
 GERALD: Seven inches. It was a deep thrust. Most of the blade. 
 DUCKY: And? 
 GERALD: And from the left to right angle. The assailant was most likely left handed. 
 DUCKY: So we've vastly limited the potential number of suspects. Only nine percent of the world's population is left-handed. Interestingly, that percentage has remained the same since prehistoric times. Archaeologists have been able to determine this by examining cave paintings more than ten thousand years old. 
 GERALD: Don't you think we should notify Gibbs? 
 DUCKY: In due time. Curiously enough, the Yanomami tribe in the Amazon are twenty three percent left-handed.

 ABBY: What, are you getting in shape? 
 TONY: Yeah, want to feel how hard my forearm is? 
 ABBY: No, thanks. Hey, Gibbs. You want to feel Tony's forearm? 
 GIBBS: I'll pass. Copy of the CIA satellite transmission. I want to see if you can enhance the image. 
 KATE: Find anything in Egan's computer? 
 ABBY: He seems hinky about the sonar device's reliability. His notes suggest that tests may have been altered. 
 TONY: Think Egan was killed because he was going to blow the whistle on the project? 
 GIBBS: Maybe.

 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 ABBY: This is the only time the assailant is on the screen. Now watch what happens when I try to go in. The closer I get to the figure, the more the image distorts. 
 GIBBS: That's it? 
 ABBY: Sorry, Gibbs. 
 KATE: We can't make an I.D. out of that. 
 TONY: Maybe we can find the polar chick. 
 KATE: Tony's right. The beach is on a Naval base. It's a restricted area. Odds are she works at Little Creek. 
 TONY: Do you want me to track her down, boss? 
 KATE: Why am I not surprised? Want me to handle it? At least I won't drool. 
 GIBBS: No. No, DiNozzo took a wave for the team. 
 TONY: Thanks, boss. Hmm... look at the muscle tone, would you? Definition on those abs. The lady definitely works out a lot. 
 ABBY: Maybe at the base gym? 
 TONY: Ah, that makes sense. 
 KATE: Don't hurt yourself. There's going to be a lot of dangerous equipment you're not familiar with. 
 TONY: That's cute, Kate. Print me a copy, Abs? 
 GIBBS: Face only, Abby. Kate, you stay with her. Go over everything in Egan's files. Find out everything you can about this device. 
 DUCKY: Oh, Jethro! Jethro, while I was examining our victim, I was telling Gerald about the Yanomami tribe. He found it fascinating. 
 GIBBS: This would affect our case somehow? 
 DUCKY: Of course! They were twenty three percent left handed. Lieutenant Commander Egan's killer was left handed. 
 GIBBS: Anything else? 
 DUCKY: He never made it into the ocean. That good fortune allowed me to find traces of someone else's DNA on his body. The DNA of a female. 
 GIBBS: That mean what I think it means, Duck? (SFX: DOOR BELL RINGS)

 EGAN: Uh, no. This is fine. 
 (PASSAGE OF TIME) 
 GIBBS: Did your husband have doubts about the project he was working on? 
 EGAN: I don't know. He was pretty distant recently. 
 GIBBS: Anything else bothering him? 
 EGAN: Not that I know of. He hated paying bills. Always gave him a stomach ache 
 GIBBS: Do you know much about the people at Side-Scan? 
 EGAN: Met them at a Christmas party. Couple of other times. He kept it pretty separate. 
 GIBBS: Because of the confidential nature of the project? 
 EGAN: I guess. 
 GIBBS: He spent a lot of time at work, didn't he? 
 EGAN: Not in the beginning. 
 GIBBS: But that changed. 
 EGAN: In the last few months. He always said all he wanted was a simple pine box. But I can't do that.

 GYM MANAGER: Gym's for base personnel only. 
 TONY: Well, I wasn't really planning on working out. 
 GYM MANAGER: Obviously.

 GIBBS: Meaning? 
 TYLER: We seeded the ocean floor with targets. 
 GIBBS: Dummy bombs. 
 TYLER: He was going out to locate them. 
 GIBBS: He had reservations about the project, didn't he? 
 TYLER: Not that I know of. Is something wrong, Agent Gibbs? 
 GIBBS: I don't know. Sometimes you think you have a bead on someone. It turns out bogus. It's upsetting. 
 TYLER: The point is? 
 GIBBS: I didn't take you for a party line type, Commander. 
 TYLER: Commander Egan wasn't sure the range was as good as promised. 
 GIBBS: What if Commander Egan's test turned up negative? 
 TYLER: The Navy wouldn't pick up Side-Scan's contract. 
 GIBBS: And Overmeyer? 
 TYLER: He'd lose a fortune. 
 GIBBS: I'm gonna press my luck here. 
 TYLER: Okay. 
 GIBBS: What if the prototype isn't found? 
 TYLER: Side-Scan will probably be granted an extension, which would buy time to correct any problems. But there aren't any serious flaws, Agent Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: Would you submit to a voluntary DNA swab? I'd like to eliminate you as Lieutenant Commander Egan's lover. 
 TYLER: There wouldn't be much point. Tom and I had been seeing each other for months. Anything else you want to press? 
 GIBBS: No. 
 TYLER: I gotta get back.

 (TONY LIFTS WEIGHTS B.G.) 
 TONY: Gina? 
 GINA: Yes? 
 TONY: Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS. 
 GINA: What do you want? 
 TONY: Ah I just want to ask you a few questions. 
 GINA: I'm busy. 
 TONY: Were you sunbathing yesterday on the base beach? 
 GINA: You were watching me? 
 TONY: No. 
 GINA: Then how did you know I was there? 
 TONY: I'm not at liberty to discuss the actual surveillance activity. 
 GINA: Please leave me alone. 
 TONY: Let me get my I.D. I can appreciate how it must look. 
 GINA: Okay, tell me. 
 KATE: (V.O.) I still can't believe Lauren Tyler admitted... 
 
 
 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BUILDING - DAY 
 KATE: ...to having an affair with Egan. 
 GIBBS: She's smart. When I asked her for a DNA sample, she knew I had her. Always better to volunteer information than cover it up. 
 OVERMEYER: What are your people doing?! 
 GIBBS: Seizing your files. 
 KATE: It's part of our investigation into Commander Egan's death. 
 OVERMEYER: You think he was killed for the prototype? 
 GIBBS: I think he had concerns about performance. 
 OVERMEYER: Well, you're wrong. 
 GIBBS: I try so hard not to be wrong, don't I, Kate? 
 KATE: You're very conscientious in that regard, Gibbs. 
 OVERMEYER: All right, we might have had a glitch or two, but nothing that wouldn't have been corrected before production. 
 GIBBS: See, you I did figure for the party line guy. 
 OVERMEYER: What's that supposed to mean? 
 GIBBS: Why was only one prototype made? 
 OVERMEYER: I funded all the R and D personally. I don't have pockets that deep. This loss is just devastating. 
 GIBBS: It also buys you time. 
 OVERMEYER: Are you insinuating I had something to do with Tom Egan's death? 
 GIBBS: I try so hard not to insinuate, don't I, Kate. 
 KATE: You rarely insinuate, Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: Yeah. All I'm doing now is taking your records. 
 OVERMEYER: I'm calling my legal counsel. 
 GIBBS: I would bet that he will insinuate plenty. Here. Sign this. 
 OVERMEYER: What's that for? 
 GIBBS: It's a receipt for your files. All of your files. 
 (HELICOPTER FX B.G.) 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. SIDE-SCAN BUILDING - DAY 
 KATE: We know the killer is left handed. (V.O.) Jonathan Overmeyer is left handed. (ON CAMERA) What about Commander Tyler?(INTERCUT FLASHBACK SCENE) 
 GIBBS: She wears her watch on her left hand like most right-handed people do. Service file will verify.(INTERCUT FLASHBACK SCENE) 
 KATE: They could be in it together. 
 GIBBS: They could. 
 (SFX: CELL PHONE RINGS) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Gibbs. 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) I found her, boss... 
 (GIBBS HANGS UP 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo found our polar bear. PHONE) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. GYM - DAY 
 GIBBS: You were on the beach yesterday? 
 GINA: Yes, Sir. I know it's against regs to sunbathe naked, but I never thought I'd be caught in winter. I don't know what came over me. I just really hate tan lines. Don't you? 
 GIBBS: Sometimes I lay awake at night thinking about that. Did you see anybody else there? 
 GINA: Well, that's why I left. I heard a vehicle. Saw this guy getting out in a wetsuit. I covered up and left. 
 KATE: Was he alone? 
 GINA: I thought so at first. But as I was walking back to my car, I heard voices and glanced back. He was arguing with someone else. 
 GIBBS: Can you describe him? 
 GINA: Her. All I can tell you is that she was military. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 FADE IN: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: We know the killer was left-handed which eliminates Commander Tyler. Her service file confirms she's a righty. 
 TONY: We also know the killer is a woman. Unless Overmeyer went "Norman Bates" on the guy. Actually, when you think about it, the M.O.'s match. 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo. 
 KATE: What did you do? 
 TONY: So basically we eliminated our two best suspects. Neither is a left-handed woman in the military. 
 GIBBS: It appears so, yeah. 
 KATE: Damn! And they were good suspects. 
 GIBBS: Yeah, maybe too good. 
 KATE: What do you mean? 
 GIBBS: We got carried away with the missing prototype. Espionage and whistle blowing is a lot more intriguing than someone who's just really pissed off. 
 KATE: Egan's wife? 
 TONY: Her husband was diving on someone else's reef. Dipping the fin in the company pool. Pinging the wrong pong. 
 KATE: Egan's wife didn't get back from the seminar until after the murder. 
 GIBBS: That's what she said. 
 KATE: (V.O.) She's a military officer.(INTERCUT FLASHBACK SCENE) 
 GIBBS: Yes, she is. And she plays golf. (V.O.) Left-handed.(INTERCUT FLASHBACK SCENE) 
 KATE: W-Wait. You could see that the clubs were left-handed with just a passing glance? 
 GIBBS: My second wife played golf left-handed. 
 KATE: So? 
 TONY: When someone tries to split your skull open with a seven iron, it's not a club you soon forget. 
 GIBBS: There was an edge in the Lieutenant's voice when she said things had changed the last few months. 
 TONY: If she knew she was cheating on her... 
 KATE: Wait, just because she golfs left-handed doesn't mean she actually is left-handed. I golf left-handed but I bat and I throw right-handed. 
 TONY: So you go both ways? 
 KATE: All I'm saying is that we don't actually have anything on her. We don't even know if she knew that her husband was having an affair. 
 GIBBS: Sure. 
 KATE: So it's just a hunch. 
 TONY: Yeah. 
 KATE: There's no proof. 
 GIBBS: No.(SFX: DOOR BELL RINGS B.G.)

 INT. EGAN LIVING ROOM 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 EGAN: Hello. 
 GIBBS: Lieutenant Egan. 
 EGAN: Please come on in. 
 GIBBS: Thank you. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 GIBBS: We have a dilemma to share with you. 
 EGAN: Dilemma. What's the problem? 
 GIBBS: We think that your husband was killed because he was about to expose flaws in the Side-Scan prototype he was developing. 
 EGAN: I see. 
 KATE: But we can't prove it. 
 GIBBS: There was only one prototype made and that was taken from the crime scene. 
 KATE: We've conducted a search, but so far no luck. We'll have to find it to have a chance of building a case against the suspect. 
 EGAN: You have a suspect? 
 KATE: A witness saw a woman arguing with your husband on the beach, just before he was stabbed. 
 GIBBS: We think it was the commanding officer, Lauren Tyler. 
 KATE: There's no easy way to ask this, but did you know your husband was having an affair with her? 
 EGAN: He was having an affair? 
 KATE: It looks that way. 
 GIBBS: Can you confirm our suspicion that your husband was having doubts about this project? 
 EGAN: I'm afraid not. He never mentioned it. 
 GIBBS: Okay. Thank you for your time. Sorry to have to drag you through this. 
 EGAN: What do you think happened to him? Why was he killed? 
 GIBBS: We think that he told Commander Tyler. And that when they both confronted Jonathan Overmeyer, he offered them money to keep them silent. 
 EGAN: And Tom refused. 
 KATE: Yes. 
 EGAN: He would never take money. 
 KATE: But Tyler went along. We believe they killed him, and had to hide the prototype fast. 
 GIBBS: We need to find it. If we don't, we don't have much of a case. It's the only conclusive proof we have of defects. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 KATE: You think she took the bait? 
 GIBBS: Pretty hard to pass up getting away with murder and framing your husband's lover. 
 KATE: Well, if she's guilty, she's a pretty good actress. 
 GIBBS: Hey, what about yourself, kid? 
 KATE: This thing is so creepy. 
 GIBBS: Why? You still don't believe she knew about her husband's affair? 
 KATE: The wife's always the last one to know, Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: Don't believe it. 
 KATE: I hope you're right. Otherwise we were pretty cold to a woman who just lost her husband. 
 GIBBS: Well, let's find out.(SFX: TELEPHONE BEEP TONES)

 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Don't worry, Abs. I'm borrowing it from G-Nex Corp and they owe me big time. It's asynchronous, multi-positional and has thermal infrared. It's perfect for your purpose. 
 ABBY: And they just let you have it? 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Technically, it's down for maintenance.

 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) Lost the signal. Give me a second. 
 (INTERCUT DRIVING SCENES) 
 ASHTON KUGEL: (ON MONITOR) The low-gain antenna has been intermittent. (V.O.) That's why it's off-line for maintenance.

 TONY: Sorry, I was at the dry cleaners. 
 GIBBS: So? 
 TONY: For Ducky. 
 GIBBS: So? 
 TONY: It was work related. 
 KATE: Your phone has been ringing off the hook. It's driving him crazy. 
 TONY: Well, she is driving me crazy. 
 KATE: She? 
 TONY: Apparently Miss "I Don't Like Tan Lines" has found something she does like. Me. 
 KATE: And why is that a problem? 
 TONY: Well, let's just say that she's a lot more appealing from a distance. A geosynchronist distance. 
 KATE: She didn't look so bad to me. 
 TONY: It's not that. She's just not my type. 
 GIBBS: Really? Female hard body likes to take her clothes off not your type? 
 TONY: I guess not. 
 KATE: Well why don't you just tell her that, then? 
 TONY: I am. 
 KATE: By not answering her calls? 
 TONY: She'll get the message. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 KATE: Apparently not. 
 GIBBS: Well, she'd better get the message soon or you're going to be getting one on a pink slip. 
 TONY: You can't fire me for something I have no control over! 
 KATE: Talk to her. 
 TONY: She'll get the message! 
 KATE: You know, I'll bet this is why number two came after you with a nine iron, wasn't it? You just refused to sit down and talk things through. 
 GIBBS: Actually, that wasn't it at all. 
 KATE: Oh. So what was it then? 
 GIBBS: Seven iron.
