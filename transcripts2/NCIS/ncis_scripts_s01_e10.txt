 INT. BASEMENT - DAY 
 "LEFT FOR DEAD" 
 VOICE ON TV: U.S. farm report. America's longest running agri-business news program.(SFX: PHONE RINGS B.G.) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Gibbs. 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) Hey, boss. Rise and shine. 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Oh. Zero five twenty. That's all I get. I'm up. Are you at the office?(BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, the boiler blew in my apartment so... it knocked out the power. I won't have any heat or electricity for a month. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) Fall asleep working on your boat again? 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Why do you say that....? 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) Boss, I know the Farm Report when I hear it. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) You only have one TV and it's in your basement. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) What do you got, DiNozzo? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) A motorist picked up a Jane Doe in Rock Creek Park. Claimed she dug herself out of a grave. No ID. And guess what? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) She can't remember her name? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, how'd you know that? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Well, uh... she's alive and you're calling her Jane Doe. What was my first clue? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Oh, yeah. That's right. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Well, it's also obvious that she has no I.D. so she was probably wearing a uniform. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Ah ha ha! She wasn't! So why did the cops call NCIS? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) Now tell me that. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) She told them there's a bomb on a Navy ship. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Hospital? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Georgetown University. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Get Kate over there. I'll call Ducky and meet you outside the office in twenty. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Hey listen, since um, you know... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) ...you're always up all night working on your boat downstairs... 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) No, you cannot stay at my place. Remember last time?

 GIBBS: Oh... 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. PARK WOODS - DAY 
 DUCKY: It's not very deep. 
 GIBBS: Hastily dug graves rarely are. 
 DUCKY: Do you know why graves are six feet deep, Gibbs? 
 GIBBS: I do. 
 DUCKY: Six feet is the minimum depth at which the smell of a decomposing corpse cannot attract wild animals. Of course, there are exceptions. A polar bear can smell... 
 GIBBS: Duck, I said I knew. 
 DUCKY: Sorry. 
 TONY: No tracks. Whoever buried her may have parked on the street and used the hiking trail. The park rangers circle hourly at night, so he'd have to move pretty fast to be parked on the road. 
 GIBBS: Well, that goes with the shallow grave. Our digger was in a hurry. Okay, let's get to work. 
 DUCKY: I don't have a body. 
 GIBBS: Go find one, Duck. 
 DUCKY: Here? 
 GIBBS: Sure. How many times have we had multiple victims? 
 DUCKY: Quite right, Jethro. 
 (DUCKY WALKS O.S.) 
 TONY: (CHUCKLES) That's slick, Boss. 
 GIBBS: What's that? 
 TONY: Getting Ducky off so he wouldn't bug us with one of those stories about... (BEAT)..we'd better get back to work. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
 SANDERSON: Her amnesia can be rooted in a number of causes. She suffered blunt force trauma to the cranium. There was some petechial hemorrhaging which is-- 
 KATE: Whoa. Petechial? 
 SANDERSON: I'm sorry. Um... pinpoint hemorrhaging on her eyelids. It's from a lack of oxygen. 
 KATE: She came close to suffocating in that grave? 
 SANDERSON: Very close. And as if the physical traumas weren't enough, one has to consider the emotional trauma of being buried alive. 
 KATE: That would shake me up. 
 SANDERSON: It's one of our oldest fears, next to being eaten by a wild animal. 
 KATE: I hadn't considered that one. 
 SANDERSON: Well, perhaps not consciously. Um... Jung postulated that we genetically inherited our primordial fears which can be triggered by smells or sounds. Oh! I'll never forget my first trip to Africa. There was a moment where... 
 KATE: (OVERLAP) Are you by any chance related to a Doctor Mallard? 
 SANDERSON: Mallard? No, I don't think so. 
 KATE: Just wondering. When will she regain her memory? 
 SANDERSON: Well, it could happen in a flash or slowing over a period of days, weeks, even months. Now her memory of being buried may never return. 
 KATE: Where are they taking her? 
 SANDERSON: For a CT scan and a neurological consult. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. WOODS - DAY 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) No, you will not put her picture on TV. 
 KATE: (V.O./FILTERED) I really... 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) I want whoever did this to think she's still dead. No, Kate. No. Our priority is finding the bomb. (TO TONY) She's bonded. 
 TONY: Kate and Jane Doe? 
 GIBBS: Oh, yeah. She hasn't even questioned her yet. (IMITATING KATE) Her eyes... they just pleaded for help. 
 TONY: I love that look in a woman. 
 DUCKY: (V.O.) I couldn't find a body. 
 TONY: Sorry. 
 DUCKY: How did you two do? 
 GIBBS: I found a couple of arrowheads. 
 DUCKY: Ah! Yeah - this one's an arrowhead, but this one's a shark's tooth. And oh... not more than a few thousand years old. 
 TONY: That recent? 
 DUCKY: Oh yes. Any older and it would be blackened and fossilized. 
 TONY: How'd it get into Rock Creek Park? 
 DUCKY: Oh, Pre-Colombian Indians - they either found a dead shark on the shore or procured it from a Casimoroid tribe. We have to notify ARPA. 
 GIBBS: After we're done here. 
 DUCKY: Come on, Gibbs. It's a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine for disturbing an archeological site. 
 GIBBS: Crime site first, Duck. 
 TONY: You know, I was just thinking. Since the arrowhead and shark's tooth were here before Jane Doe was buried....never mind. 
 DUCKY: Wouldn't it be fascinating if our Jane Doe was unknowingly interred atop a prehistoric burial? It's happened to me once before you know. In sixty eight.... Or was it sixty seven? No matter. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: I appreciate your letting me do this. 
 WOMAN: I'd like to know who I am, too. 
 KATE: I'll need your clothes. 
 WOMAN: My clothes? 
 KATE: If you handled explosives, our forensic people will find particles on your clothing. 
 WOMAN: Of course. 
 KATE: Can I have your right hand please? 
 WOMAN: I think I've done this before. 
 KATE: If so, that's good news. You'll be on somebody's database. 
 WOMAN: The FBI's terrorist list? 
 KATE: You have to stop thinking like that. 
 WOMAN: How am I to think? I know there's a bomb on a Navy ship and I put it here! 
 KATE: Do you remember placing it? 
 WOMAN: No. But I know it's there. 
 KATE: Well, knowing it's there doesn't mean you placed it. Does it? 
 WOMAN: No. I suppose not. 
 (VOICE OVER P.A. B.G.) 
 (INTERCUT FLASHBACK SCENES OF INSIDE THE CHURCH) 
 KATE: What is it? 
 WOMAN: I remember being in a church. 
 KATE: Which church? 
 WOMAN: I... don't know. 
 KATE: You will. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. PARK WOODS - DAY 
 DUCKY: We found a forty seventy caliber bullet lodged in the Comanche's femur. Now since the forty seventy cavalry carbine was introduced in eighteen seventy three we have an approximate date to work with. 
 TONY: Speaking of dates to work from. We've worked together for two years and you know, I have no idea where you live. 
 DUCKY: Well, I'd just as well we kept it that way, Tony. 
 TONY: Right. 
 GIBBS: Well, hello. 
 DUCKY: Ah, another artifact? 
 GIBBS: Only if your Pre-Colombians used keys. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS 
 ABBY: I suppose you want me to find out what chastity belt this opens. 
 GIBBS: Do I look like DiNozzo? 
 TONY: Not funny, Boss. Besides, I could open a chastity belt. 
 ABBY: Did you ever see one? Mine's awesome. It's eighteenth century French. 
 TONY: You have a chastity belt? 
 GIBBS: So much more information than I need to know about Abby, and not enough about this key. 
 ABBY: The key opens a magnetized lock. Instead of serrations, magnets repel magnetized pins. 
 GIBBS: Hotel room? 
 ABBY: Possibly. But it could be any high security lock. There's no logos or serial numbers. But a magnetic code is like a fingerprint. So it'll lead me back to whatever system made the code on the key. 
 KATE: Hospital called. The rape kit's negative. Anything on her prints or clothing? 
 ABBY: Nothing on the fingerprints yet, but the gas chromatograph should be giving me something on her clothes soon. 
 GIBBS: Hey, how was your interview? 
 KATE: It's sad, Gibbs. She's trying so hard. She desperately wants to help. 
 GIBBS: I'm glad. But did she remember anything? 
 KATE: She did. She thinks that she's been fingerprinted before. 
 TONY: Terrorist. 
 KATE: And she remembers praying in church. She's not the terrorist type, Tony. 
 TONY: Oh, so you're thinking more Emma Thompson than Angelina Jolie? 
 (SFX: BEEP TONES B.G.) 
 ABBY: Got a whup! 
 GIBBS: What kind of whup, Abby? Abby? 
 ABBY: Okay, um... this hit is erythritol. It's used in low-carb sweeteners. And this spike is trimethylene. It's found in polyester fibers. Dinitrate is a common angina medication. And this is glycol, and glycol is antifreeze. 
 TONY: So Jane Doe uses low-carb sweetener, wears polyester, puts her own anti-freeze in her car and has a heart condition. 
 ABBY: Or she's mixing up a brew to go boom! Big time. All these chemicals are used in high grade explosives. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 FADE IN: 
 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
 WOMAN: I don't know which is worse. Not knowing who you are... or knowing you're a terrorist. 
 KATE: The chemicals on your clothing do not make you a terrorist. I told you they have other uses. 
 WOMAN: My heart's fine. I hate polyester. I don't like artificial sweetener. 
 KATE: How do you know? 
 WOMAN: I just know. Like... I know I don't like strawberries, but I love blueberries. I know what I like and what I don't like, Agent Todd. I just don't know who I am, what I do or where I live. 
 KATE: Okay, let's say the residue was from the explosives. It could have come from a...a legitimate occupation. 
 WOMAN: What? I'm an explosiver hersteller? Explosiver hersteller. That means explosive maker in German! How do I know that? 
 KATE: Maybe it's your job title? Sprechen sie Deutsch? 
 WOMAN: No. 
 KATE: Okay, maybe it's a German firm here. If you worked in Germany you would know the language. You realize what this can mean? 
 WOMAN: Yeah. It means that I could have put a bomb on a Navy ship. 
 KATE: Or... you know who did and they tried to kill you. 
 WOMAN: You think? 
 KATE: I do. 
 WOMAN: Why do you believe in me? 
 KATE: Why do you like blueberries? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
 SANDERSON: I can't release a woman who doesn't know her name, Agent Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: What's the neurological consult say? 
 SANDERSON: She's in no medical danger, but she doesn't know who she is, where she lives, her phone number, anything! I can't release her! 
 KATE: Yes, you can, Doctor. Tell them, Maureen. 
 WOMAN: My name's Maureen Ingalls. I live at six twenty Niagara Street in Alexandria. I don't think I ever remembered my phone number. 
 GIBBS: You remember who buried you? 
 KATE: She may always block that memory. Isn't that right, Doctor? 
 SANDERSON: Yes. Most traumatic amnesiacs never recall the event which triggered the memory loss. In fact, I have a case where there were three accident victims who... 
 TONY: (OVERLAP) What if her attacker returns? 
 KATE: She'll be in protective custody at my place. 
 SANDERSON: So you'll assume responsibility for signing her out? 
 KATE: Of course. 
 SANDERSON: I still suggest she stays for another twenty four hours, but since she's recovered her memory, I... 
 KATE: Thank you, Doctor. Oh, and Ms. Ingalls has no clothes. So can she borrow a set of greens? 
 SANDERSON: No problem. Follow me, please. 
 KATE: I'll join you in a minute. 
 (SANDERSON AND WOMAN WALK O.S.) 
 GIBBS: Okay, who's Maureen Ingalls? 
 KATE: How do you know she isn't? (BEAT) My cousin. 
 TONY: That was a quick fold. 
 GIBBS: Kate, do you realize the laws you're violating by signing her out when you know she's lying? 
 KATE: Her memory is already coming back, Gibbs. She remembered the German word for "explosive fabricator." 
 TONY: She speaks German? 
 KATE: No, but I think she makes explosives for a German firm here. 
 TONY: Or a German terrorist cell with ties to Al Qaeda. 
 KATE: Well, since Al Qaeda is not listed in the Yellow Pages, let's start checking German munition makers first. 
 TONY: Whoa. What's with you and Jane Doe? 
 KATE: She'll be occupying my spare bedroom so I don't have to say no to you. 
 TONY: Oh, did I ask? Did I? 
 GIBBS: Why are you doing this, Kate? 
 KATE: She's terrified, Gibbs. I should think my place would be more conducive to her recovering her memory than a hospital. And we need to find that bomb. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 (MUSIC PLAYS B.G.) 
 ABBY: Gotcha! 
 GIBBS: Love to hear that word out of your dark lips, Abby. 
 ABBY: Hey guys. What did you find? 
 TONY: Kate willing to give her bedroom to Jane Doe and not me. 
 ABBY: Shocking. 
 GIBBS: The gotcha? 
 ABBY: You were right, Gibbs. I matched the magnetic code to a system made by MagSecure. It's a hotel key. 
 GIBBS: You got a list of the hotels? 
 ABBY: MagSecure's faxing it over. It'll be here shortly. 
 TONY: What's that on the top? 
 ABBY: A scratch. 
 TONY: Mm, that's more than a scratch. 
 ABBY: You might actually be right. 
 TONY: Want to know what my vision is? 
 GIBBS: No. 
 TONY: Twenty ten. Same as Ted Williams. He could see the seams on a fastball coming at him. 
 GIBBS: How about knuckles? 
 (SFX: BEEP TONES) 
 ABBY: Whoa. 
 GIBBS: Whoa. How did someone etch letters that small? 
 ABBY: Micro-laser. It was developed to put serial numbers on diamonds. The numbers are invisible to the naked eye... 
 TONY: Not mine. 
 ABBY: .... so the thieves think their heist is fence-able and then wham - they get five to ten. 
 GIBBS: Why use them on a room key? 
 ABBY: Maybe somebody was playing with the hotel's new toy. Like when photocopiers first came out and people were copying everything from C-notes to their butts. 
 TONY: You sat your naked butt on a photocopier, didn't you, Abby. 
 ABBY: Yep. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
 WOMAN: (V.O.) This is you with the President. 
 KATE: I used to be with the Secret Service on Air Force One. 
 WOMAN: Why'd you leave? 
 KATE: Work at NCIS is more interesting. 
 WOMAN: Than flying around the country with the President? 
 KATE: Well, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Constantly on edge. Worried that some nut is going to take a shot at him. 
 WOMAN: Or blow him up. 
 KATE: Try this sweater and pants. They should fit all right. 
 WOMAN: I've been trying to recall that ship. I know it's not a carrier. 
 KATE: Submarine? 
 WOMAN: No. 
 KATE: There are no active battleships so it would have to be a cruiser or a destroyer. 
 (SFX: COMPUTER BEEP TONES B.G.) 
 WOMAN: They look the same. 
 KATE: Not to the Navy. 
 WOMAN: No, it's one of them I'm sure of it. Can't you just search them? 
 KATE: Well, these aren't two ships. They're two classes of ships. There are eighteen destroyers and seven cruisers in Norfolk alone. 
 WOMAN: Oh. I wish I could give you a name. 
 KATE: Maybe you can. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 (MUSIC B.G.) 
 ABBY: It looks like they're only three hotels in the D.C. area that use MagSecure keys. 
 TONY: And the phone number for the Jackson is five five five... 
 GIBBS: (OVERLAP) Triple five zero one hundred. 
 TONY: Do you got contact lenses? 
 GIBBS: Nope. (INTO PHONE) Can I talk to your manager, please? 
 TONY: Laser surgery? 
 GIBBS: No. DiNozzo, put a sock in it. Contact the rest of these hotels. (INTO PHONE) Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS. Navy Criminal Investigative Service. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. KATE'S HOUSE - DAY 
 WOMAN: I never knew the Navy had so many ships. 
 KATE: Yeah, these are just the cruisers and destroyers. 
 WOMAN: Some of the names sound familiar. 
 KATE: The cruisers are named after battles and the destroyers are named after Naval heroes. 
 WOMAN: None of them ring a bell, so to speak. 
 KATE: It was worth a shot. 
 (WOMAN SIGHS) 
 KATE: What's wrong? 
 WOMAN: I just feel a little dizzy. 
 KATE: Maybe I should take you back to the hospital. 
 WOMAN: No! No. I think... I'm just weak from hunger. I don't remember the last time I ate. 
 KATE: Well we'd better get you some food then. 
 (KATE OPENS THE CLOSET DOOR) 
 WOMAN: I think I have a coat like this. 
 KATE: Are you sure? 
 WOMAN: The texture...and these buttons. Yeah. I'm positive. 
 KATE: It's a Michael B. There's only a few stores that carry his line. 
 WOMAN: Let's go. 
 KATE: First we eat. 
 WOMAN: Food can wait. Finding the bomb is more important. 
 KATE: You never know when you get to eat on my job. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 TONY: None of the hotels micro-etch their keys. 
 ABBY: Well, somebody etched "The Apartment" on that key. 
 GIBBS: Maybe a permanent resident. What hotels besides the Jackson take permanent residents? 
 TONY: Neither of them. 
 GIBBS: We'll need a search authorization. 
 TONY: How'd you know that Jackson had permanent residents? 
 GIBBS: I just did. 
 TONY: Did you used to live there once, Boss? Or... 
 GIBBS: No. 
 TONY: Did you know someone who lives there... 
 GIBBS: My ex-wife lives there. 
 TONY: Oh. Oh. So you didn't read the phone number, you knew it. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. MICHAEL'S DESIGN SHOP 
 KATE: Anything familiar? The sound of the traffic outside, the smell of the clothing ...anything? 
 SALESWOMAN: It's been a while, hasn't it? 
 WOMAN: You remember me? 
 SALESWOMAN: Oh, no. Your coat's about three years old. Still looks great, though. You know, you should check out his new line. It's really fantastic. 
 WOMAN: I prefer black. 
 SALESWOMAN: Oh, of course. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 KATE: Do you recognize him? 
 WOMAN: He reminds me of the man that attacked me.

 TONY: Very expensive-looking, Boss. I hope she's not sticking you with the... 
 GIBBS: (OVERLAP) Has Mister Richter had a suite here for long? 
 MANAGER: Over two years. 
 GIBBS: Then you know him well? 
 MANAGER: Well, not really. If the residents don't call us with a problem, we respect their privacy. Here we are, suite eighty seven hundred. Oh, my.

 INT. DESIGNER SHOP - DAY 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) Gibbs. She just remembered the man who attacked her. 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) Okay. Did she give you a name?

 INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
 KOCHIFIS: You're telling me the suits from Hoover didn't save the man? 
 TONY: Hell, no. It was N-C-I-us. 
 KOCHIFIS: Not according to the TV reports. 
 TONY: Yeah, well when do they get it right? (TO GIBBS) Boss, this is Detective Andy Kochifis, Homicide - cut me some slack on the Major Kerry investigation. 
 GIBBS: Maybe he'll do it again. 
 KOCHIFIS: What? I do it once and I'm a whore? 
 GIBBS: A courtesan, maybe. Richter had a year's lease, it's not the home address on his driver's license. 
 TONY: There's no clothes in the closet. No photos. Just hotel amenities. 
 GIBBS: Check the booze. 
 TONY: Oh, yeah. That's not hotel stock. Macallan Eighteen, Belvedere and Bombay Sapphire. 
 KOCHIFIS: Could be a beltway bandit who leased this suite for company entertainment. 
 GIBBS: In his own name? 
 KOCHIFIS: Tony said an amnesia case led you here. 
 GIBBS: Yeah, found a key to this place in Jane Doe's grave. 
 KOCHIFIS: I thought she was alive. 
 TONY: Yeah, she woke up taking a dirt nap in Rock Creek Park and did a Dracula. 
 KOCHIFIS: That's a new one. 
 GIBBS: Whoever buried her thinks she's dead. I'd like to keep it that way. 
 KOCHIFIS: Okay. But why do you want the lead on the investigation? 
 GIBBS: There may be a Navy terrorist attack in the mix. We'd just like to keep it all in one ball of wax. 
 TONY: Yeah, look how well we did last time, huh... 
 KOCHIFIS: Not according to-- 
 TONY: To the TV, yeah. I know, don't rub it in. 
 KOCHIFIS: All right, look. If our M.E.'s cool, so am I. 
 DIGGER: Ducky, I should do this autopsy. 
 DUCKY: Now Digger, I can cite you a dozen cases where the local authority was usurped by an ongoing Federal investigation. Look at Lincoln's assignation. He was shot at the Ford Theater only a few blocks from here. Now that is an autopsy I would-- 
 (SFX: RAPID BEEP TONES) 
 DUCKY: Seventy one point nine. 
 DIGGER: (OVERLAP) Seventy two point three. 
 DUCKY: My god, Digger. When did your department last update its field kits? Your probe is so old it could've been used on Typhoid Mary. Were you as amazed by her story as I was Digger? A healthy woman making all those people sick and not having a clue. Can you imagine not having a clue, Digger? 
 DIGGER: You know, you're right. Our equipment is outdated. We're backed up at the lab anyway. He's all yours, Ducky. (TO KOCHIFIS) NCIS will handle the autopsy. 
 KOCHIFIS: Okay, Aldridge. 
 GIBBS: What'd he die from, Duck? 
 GIBBS: A blunt object to the back of the head. Yes, I believe we'll find blood in hair. Well, blood on an object here. One of the bookends, the obelisk. The crystal ashtray. I hope he didn't suffer the indignity of being whacked by this tawdry bust of President Kennedy. 
 GIBBS: Tony. 
 TONY: I'm on it. 
 GIBBS: Was he murdered before our Jane Doe was buried? 
 DUCKY: Liver temperature was close to room temperature. So he deceased at least eighteen hours ago. 
 GIBBS: You didn't answer my question. 
 DUCKY: Jethro, I don't answer forensic questions I don't know the answers to. You know that. Why do you keep asking me? 
 GIBBS: Force of habit. 
 TONY: Bad news, Ducky. It looks like blood on the Kennedy bust. 
 DUCKY: Oh, you poor man!

 EXT. CAFé - NIGHT 
 WOMAN: What kind of person am I to be involved in this? 
 KATE: Well, we don't know what the "this" is yet or how you're involved. And bad things happen to good people all the time. I sound like a self-help book. 
 WOMAN: No, you've been wonderful to me. And I deeply appreciate it, Kate. I just wish I could remember more. 
 KATE: So the name Walter Richter means nothing to you? 
 WOMAN: Nothing. Will I have to look at his body? 
 KATE: Maybe not. We're running a background check and we'll find out how he's connected to you - if he's connected to you at all. 
 WAITRESS: Here you are. 
 KATE: I'm starving. How about you? 
 WOMAN: Famished.

 ABBY: Guys, this is weird. 
 TONY: Ducky didn't like it either. Said it was tawdry. 
 ABBY: Oh, no no. The bust is cool. It's what I found that's weird. There's a partial palm print on this bust of Kennedy. And if you remember your history, there was a partial palm print on the Mannlicher rifle used to assassinate Kennedy. 
 TONY: Don't tell me that you tried to match them? 
 ABBY: No, there's not enough of a print there to match. But I just thought it'd be cool to try. 
 GIBBS: Are you saying that our palm print may be useless for identification? 
 ABBY: Yes. But don't you think that's weird? That the Kennedy bust and the Kennedy murder weapon both have partial palm prints. 
 GIBBS: That's not what I think is weird, Ab. What about the latents you found at the hotel room? 
 ABBY: Um... there were some unknowns and some matches. The ones on the crystal tumbler and the Macallan belong to the victim. But what's going to make your day is the latent you lifted off the desk. The one on the left side Kate took off Jane Doe in the hospital. On the right side... is your print from the desk. 
 TONY: Oh, they match. 
 ABBY: Fourteen Galton points. 
 GIBBS: Jane Doe was in that hotel suite. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY LAB - DAY 
 DUCKY: Our victim died from a subdural hematoma caused by a skull fracture. I believe we'll find that this impression in the parietal lobe will match that on the gaudy bust of President Kennedy. 
 GIBBS: Got a time of death yet? 
 DUCKY: Well, due to the fixed lividity, the degree of putrefaction, the level of Escherichia coli in the stomach and digestive tract... 
 GIBBS: Ducky! 
 DUCKY: At least forty four hours ago. That's the best I can do with any certainly. 
 GIBBS: Our Jane Doe was found at zero three fifty, Monday. Less than two days ago. 
 DUCKY: It's safe to say our guest didn't put her in the ground. 
 GIBBS: None of this is getting us to a bomb on a ship, Duck. 
 TONY: Ah, but it is, Boss. Background on Richter. He was head of Security for a German firm. B-B-B. What is with the Germans and the alphabet thing? B-M-W, B-M-G, B-A-S-F. And they're all B's. 
 GIBBS: I'm resisting the urge to say cut the B.S. 
 TONY: B-F-F stands for Bombe Fermentdeckung Fabrik. 
 GIBBS: Tell me that bombe means the same in German as it does in English. 
 TONY: (IN GERMAN) Jawohl mein Kapitan. (IN ENGLISH) B-F-F makes bomb detecting devices for the U.S. Navy. 
 GIBBS: Yeah. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OFFICE - DAY 
 BRAUER: In a hotel? 
 GIBBS: The Jackson. 
 BRAUER: (IN GERMAN) Mein Gott! (IN ENGLISH) Suite eighty seven hundred? I was there Friday. 
 TONY: To kill Richter? 
 BRAUER: No. How could you ask such a question? 
 TONY: It's my job. 
 BRAUER: I take it you don't have the murderer, Agent Gibbs. 
 TONY: What were you doing at The Jackson Friday? 
 BRAUER: We maintain a suite there. Two of our senior engineers were over from Berlin. We had drinks before dinner. 
 GIBBS: Why is the room leased in Richter's name? 
 BRAUER: Ours is a very competitive business. We don't want our arrivals knowing where our firm puts our people. Maids have been bribed. Phones bugged. 
 TONY: People murdered. 
 BRAUER: That's a first for us. 
 GIBBS: It may not be the last. 
 TONY: Who's your explosiver hersteller? 
 BRAUER: Suzanne McNeil. Is she dead, too? 
 GIBBS: Do you have a photo of her? 
 BRAUER: Yes, in our personnel records. 
 GIBBS: What kind of work does she do for you? 
 BRAUER: She formulates explosives for our testing aids. Please tell me Suzanne is not dead. 
 TONY: Suzanne is not dead. 
 (BRAUER STOPS TYPING) 
 GIBBS: Whoops. 
 TONY: Big whoops. 
 GIBBS: You looked kind of surprised to find out she is alive, Brauer. 
 BRAUER: Yeah. You tell me Walter has been murdered. You say he may not be the only one. Then you ask me about Suzanne. Of course I assume that she is dead, too. 
 (SFX: COMPUTER BEEP TONES) 
 BRAUER: This is Suzanne McNeil. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
 KATE: Are you sure you're ready to do this? 
 WOMAN: I don't know. But if it can help me regain my memory, I guess I have no choice, right? 
 KATE: Come on. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS AUTOPSY ROOM 
 KATE: Doctor Mallard, this is Jane Doe. 
 DUCKY: Hello. 
 WOMAN: Doctor. 
 (SFX: DOOR OPENS/BODY SLIDES OUT) 
 DUCKY: Ready? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. HOTEL ROOM - FLASHBACK 
 RIVERS: There is six months of severance here. I advise you take it and look for new worlds to conquer.

 KATE: Anything? 
 WOMAN: Nothing. Poor man. 
 DUCKY: Yes.

 FADE IN: 
 INT. ATRIUM - DAY 
 (VOICES IN GERMAN B.G.) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Her name's Suzanne McNeil. (BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) She formulates explosives for B.F.F. 
 KATE: Well if she put a bomb on a ship it could be for a test. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) I've e-mailed her personnel file to you. She's got a Top Security clearance. It'll be like telling her life story. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) She didn't recognize Richter? 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) No. No. All she felt was sympathy for him. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) She got all teary eyed over a body she didn't know? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) She's a nice lady, Gibbs. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Oh, yeah. So you keep telling me. 
 (CAMERA ANGLE ON TONY AND WOMAN) 
 KATE: (V.O./FILTERED) Does Brauer know that she lost her memory? 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Maybe. He knows she's alive. He's not in cuffs. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) He probably thinks she's unconscious or too traumatized to remember. 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) Are you sure he buried her? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Oh, yeah. 
 KATE: (V.O./FILTERED) Why did he want her dead? 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) I've got a couple of ideas. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) Want to share? 
 (GIBBS HANGS UP THE PHONE/END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 KATE: I guess not. (TO WOMAN) Suzanne! 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. ATRIUM - DAY 
 (ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE OPEN) 
 BRAUER: I'll be with you in a moment. 
 TONY: You see, you told that to Gibbs a half hour ago. Look at the expression on his face. Not good. Make this one a quickie. 
 BRAUER: (IN GERMAN) Ich weiss... 
 (TONY WALKS TO GIBBS) 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo.... 
 TONY: Sorry, Boss. This guy's Webster's definition of a micro-manager. People need his permission to take a whiz. 
 GIBBS: I could have gone for coffee. What'd you pick up? Anything? 
 TONY: No. Give me a few minutes with his girl and... 
 (GIBBS HITS DINOZZO) 
 TONY: (BEAT) ...from the little English I heard, the new "Bombe Snuffler" isn't snuffling so good. Brauer's worried it won't pass Navy acceptance trials Thursday. 
 GIBBS: Test? On a Navy ship? 
 TONY: If I heard there were going to be tests on a Navy ship, do you think we'd still be standing here, Boss? 
 GIBBS: Oh, sorry. Forgot your minds work concurrently. Where is this test taking place? 
 TONY: In some lab here. 
 BRAUER: I apologize for the delay, Agent Gibbs. What would you like to see first? 
 GIBBS: The lab where you're conducting the Navy test on Thursday. 
 BRAUER: Why do you want to go there? 
 GIBBS: Your Security of Security is dead. NCIS is tasked with protecting Navy brass. 
 BRAUER: You think terrorists killed him? 
 GIBBS: These days I look for terrorists behind most everything. 
 BRAUER: Of course. Ja. This way, please. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: Suzanne McNeil... this is your life. 
 SUZANNE: Hmm. You read it? 
 KATE: Yes. 
 SUZANNE: Is there anything I wouldn't want to know? 
 KATE: The sad and lonely woman? There's plenty of time for a husband and kids, Suzanne. 
 SUZANNE: The good ones are all married. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
 GIBBS: How well did you know Suzanne McNeil? 
 BRAUER: Oh, didn't she tell you? 
 GIBBS: I'd like your opinion on her relationship. 
 BRAUER: Well, I know Suzanne quite well professionally. She is one of my key employees. 
 TONY: Kind of sexy, too. 
 BRAUER: Oh, I think you find all women that way, Agent DiNozzo. 
 TONY: Oh, come on. You've got to admit she's pretty sexy. 
 BRAUER: I'm happily married. 
 TONY: Yeah? 
 GIBBS: Do you have micro-etching equipment here? 
 BRAUER: Yeah. Richter uses... used it for security purposes. 
 GIBBS: Did you ever see this old film "The Apartment" with Jack Lemmon? 
 BRAUER: No, I don't believe so. 
 TONY: Richter did. 
 BRAUER: Probably. He loved those movies. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
 BRAUER: But what does this have to do with... 
 GIBBS: I assume the photo in your office is your wife. 
 BRAUER: (IN GERMAN) Ja. 
 GIBBS: Lovely woman 
 BRAUER: (IN GERMAN) Dahnke. 
 TONY: Older than Suzanne, of course. 
 BRAUER: Are you implying that I had an affair with Ms. McNeil? 
 GIBBS: Did you? 
 BRAUER: No, Agent Gibbs, I did not. A man in my position cannot afford to risk losing everything in one of your ridiculous sexual harassment suits. 
 GIBBS: There is a motive. 
 TONY: Sure is. 
 BRAUER: Yeah, I suppose someone in your profession would look at it that way. But why would I murder Walter Richter who wasn't only a close associate, but my friend? 
 GIBBS: I don't know. 
 BRAUER: I wouldn't. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. TEST FACILITY - DAY 
 (SFX: DOOR BUZZER) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 RUTGER: (IN GERMAN) Who are these people, Stephen? 
 BRAUER: (IN GERMAN) It's okay. 
 TONY: Is that a bomb sniffer? 
 BRAUER: We don't breed dogs. It's a Fernschaltung Sprengstoff Spuren Einheitour. 
 TONY: It'll never take first in show at Westminster. 
 GIBBS: Where is that ship? 
 BRAUER: In here, Agent Gibbs.(DOOR OPENS) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. CORRIDOR 
 GIBBS: Is this where you use the explosives Suzanne makes? 
 BRAUER: Ja. She makes exotic bombs to test our detecting devices. 
 KATE: (V.O.) You did put a bomb on a Navy ship. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: Only the ship was a mock-up. You make bombs for tests. Didn't I tell you it was going to be something like this? 
 SUZANNE: Yes, you did. Oh... but this is like reading someone else's life. Not mine. I don't remember any of it. 
 KATE: You've got to give it time, Suzanne. 
 SUZANNE: How much time do I have, Kate? Someone tried to kill me. Someone bashed in that poor man's head. Maybe if I go there... where I work... this B-F-F...it'll come back to me. 
 KATE: I think you've been through enough for one day. 
 SUZANNE: No! Please, Kate! If I can just sit at my desk and meet other people... living people. I just... I think I'll remember. Please? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. TEST FACILITY 
 (SFX: ROBOT MOVES B.G.) 
 TONY: What's that? 
 RUTGER: Chemical signatures we are detecting. Nitrates, mercury, glycols, cyclotrimethylenes. Object Four B contains a compound of cyclonite and penaerythrite tetranitrate. 
 BRAUER: Terrorist grade Semtex. 
 TONY: Our NCIS explosive sniffer would tag that. 
 BRAUER: Well, this test is just beginning. There are more sophisticated explosives that your equipment could not detect. 
 TONY: What makes your sniffer better? 
 RUTGER: Our software. Chemical signatures are compared to a databank of all known explosive compounds. When a critical composition is detected, it sets off an alarm. 
 GIBBS: It's only as good as the software. 
 BRAUER: Which is very good, very good. 
 GIBBS: Then why are you worried about the Navy trials? 
 BRAUER: Is that what Suzanne said? 
 RUTGER: She would be pleased to see us fail. 
 GIBBS: Why? 
 RUTGER: She would win, of course. And Suzanna likes to win. 
 BRAUER: It's her job to create explosives we cannot detect. 
 GIBBS: So she held a few surprises back because she likes to win. 
 BRAUER: In the beginning she had some limited successes, but Doctor Rutger has re-written the software to... 
 (SFX: EXPLOSION B.G.) 
 GIBBS: I had a hunting dog like that once. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. ATRIUM - DAY 
 GIBBS: Hey. Well? 
 KATE: Reading her file didn't work. She thought being up in her office might help her remember. 
 TONY: How'd she know where her office was? 
 KATE: It's called a directory, Tony. 
 BRAUER: Are you speaking of Ms. McNeil? 
 GIBBS: Yeah, we are. Kate Todd, B-F-F CEO Stephen Brauer. 
 KATE: Mister Brauer. 
 BRAUER: What doesn't she remember? 
 GIBBS: Well, why don't you ask her yourself?

 INT. ATRIUM - DAY 
 KATE: Anything? 
 SUZANNE: No. 
 BRAUER: Suzanne? 
 SUZANNE: We know each other? 
 BRAUER: Ja. I'm Stephen. Stephen. 
 SUZANNE: I'm sorry, Mister Stephen. I... I don't remember you. 
 BRAUER: Brauer. Stephen is my given name. 
 SUZANNE: Sorry, Mister Brauer. 
 GIBBS: Well, that's both good news and bad news. She can't tell you the formula to her explosive... but then again, she can't remember who buried her in Rock Creek Park. 
 BRAUER: Were you buried? 
 SUZANNE: Yes. 
 BRAUER: And you don't remember anything? 
 SUZANNE: Only that I like blueberries. 
 BRAUER: Come, Suzanne. Sit with me. Perhaps if we talk.... 
 (SUZANNE AND BRAUER WALK TO THE COUCHES) 
 GIBBS: That son of a bitch is guilty as hell. 
 (CAMERA ANGLE ON SUZANNE AND BRAUER) 
 SUZANNE: You didn't have the guts to leave her but you buried me. 
 BRAUER: You don't have amnesia. 
 SUZANNE: Stephen, you'd better be careful. You don't want those agents to see you scared. 
 (CAMERA ANGLE ON TONY) 
 TONY: You remember when I stayed with you that time, when it didn't really go so well? 
 GIBBS: Yeah, I remember, DiNozzo. 
 TONY: Well, listen. I was younger then. Immature. A little unfocused. 
 GIBBS: That was six months ago, Tony. 
 (CAMERA ANGLE ON BRAUER) 
 BRAUER: What happened in the office was an accident and you know that. You were... out of control. 
 SUZANNE: I'm not now. 
 BRAUER: No. You are quite calm. Suzanne, we can work this out. I'll give you anything. Anything. 
 SUZANNE: A wedding ring? 
 BRAUER: Ja. I'll divorce Brigitte. 
 SUZANNE: The hell you will. You don't have the guts. You couldn't even come to the apartment to dump me. You sent Walther. 
 BRAUER: You murdered Walther? 
 (CAMERA ANGLE ON KATE) 
 KATE: She said someone bashed the poor man's head in. How did she know that Richter's head was bashed in? I couldn't see his wound. Nobody told her how he died. She remembered. 
 (CAMERA ANGLE ON SUZANNE) 
 SUZANNE: No one dumps me, Stephen. My latest compound. It's so volatile; all you have to do is drop it. 
 BRAUER: Then you'll die, too. 
 SUZANNE: I've already been buried. 
 BRAUER: (IN GERMAN) Sie hat eine bombe! 
 KATE: Suzanne! Don't! 
 SUZANNE: Sorry, Kate.

 GIBBS: Could anyone make you feel better? 
 TONY: No. 
 GIBBS: My door's unlocked.
