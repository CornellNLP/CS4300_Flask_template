 SHREWE: Nice accent. 
 NILES: Works for her. 
 SHREWE: With the Sangria she's downed, Swahili would work for her. 
 NILES: Where'd Wilkes go? 
 SHREWE: Ah...I don't know. He just kind of wandered off.

 "HIGH SEAS"(SFX: GAME ON TV B.G.) 
 (SFX: GIBBS WORKS ON THE BOAT B.G.) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 GIBBS: (ON TAPE) Gibbs. Talk. 
 BURLEY: (V.O./FILTERED) Gibbs, Stan Burley. Put down whatever the hell you're doing with that stupid boat and pick up! I'm working a case on the Enterprise. I sure could use some help on this one. Really could use your help, boss. 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Okay, you got my interest. What's going on, Stan? 
 BURLEY: (V.O./FILTERED) Two days ago an Arresting Gear... (BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 BURLEY: (V.O.) ... Operator went wacko on Liberty in Roda. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 BURLEY: (INTO PHONE) His crewmates found him naked in a restaurant freezer. His body temperature was one oh six. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) What kind of drugs? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 BURLEY: (INTO PHONE) Well, I'm thinking amphetamines. Still waiting for the tox report. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Well, to trigger the seizure you're describing, chances are he's a chronic drug user. 
 BURLEY: (V.O./FILTERED) You'd think. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 BURLEY: (INTO PHONE) Only his last random piss test was negative. That was less than three weeks ago. I'm in a squeeze, Gibbs. (V.O./FILTERED) I don't have enough (INTO PHONE) time to work on this one by myself. 
 (JET LANDS B.G.) 
 (END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 KATE: (V.O.) How long did Burley work here? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 ABBY: Five years. 
 TONY: Five years with Gibbs? Amazing the guy didn't end up in a straight jacket. 
 GIBBS: What was that? 
 TONY: Oh, nothing, boss. Just praising your communication skills. 
 ABBY: I really miss Burley. He was cool, you know. 
 DUCKY: Listen, when you see Agent Burley, would one of you mind giving him this? 
 KATE: No problem. 
 DUCKY: Cricket ball. Well, he was not only an amazing agent; he was also an incredible athlete. And cricket was one of the few games he wasn't an expert in. 
 TONY: Ah, shame. 
 DUCKY: Yeah, I think he'll get a kick out of it. 
 ABBY: Of course he will. He gets a kick out of everything. I love that guy! 
 GIBBS: Okay. The COD's waiting for us. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK 
 TONY: Just accept the fact that you're going to get lost. 
 KATE: Why do you assume I'm going to? 
 TONY: Because everyone does. A carrier is a big and confusing place first time on board. 
 KATE: Duly noted. 
 GIBBS: The numbers are stenciled on the bulkheads. First one tells you the deck level. They're called bull's-eyes. 
 KATE: Deck level. 
 GIBBS: The second one the frame number. Third tells you the compartment's position in relation to the ship's centerline. The last letter tells you what the space is used for. 
 TONY: Crossing from port to starboard or starboard to port isn't as simple as going straight across. 
 GIBBS: Sometimes you've got to go up one deck and down another. 
 TONY: Or down one deck and up another. 
 GIBBS: Sometimes two. 
 TONY: It's frustrating. 
 GIBBS: Not to mention confusing. But you'll get the hang of it. 
 TONY: After you get lost a few times.

 CREW CHIEF: (V.O.) Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds till trap. 
 GIBBS: You okay? Good. Just so you know, this isn't like landing in a seven forty seven. 
 KATE: I sort of assumed. 
 GIBBS: Dropping from a hundred and twenty knots to zero in one second can take it out of you. Just try to... 
 (SFX: COD LANDS) 
 GIBBS: ....breathe normally. 
 KATE: (BREATHES OUT) Whew 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) Tox report come back yet, Stan? 
 BURLEY: Just like we thought. Traces of meth in the bloodstream. 
 GIBBS: His urine was negative just twenty seven days ago? 
 BURLEY: According to the Urinalysis Coordinator, clean as a whistle. 
 TONY: Where's this Petty Officer Wilkes now? 
 BURLEY: Still in sick bay. You the one at my desk now? 
 TONY: That's right. Gibb's must have told you about me. 
 BURLEY: Actually no. Abby mentioned it in passing. Just assigned? 
 TONY: Two years. 
 BURLEY: Really? Huh. 
 (VOICE OVER P.A. B.G.) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. PASSAGE WAY - DAY 
 GIBBS: You said he was an Arresting Gear Operator? 
 BURLEY: Yes, boss. 
 GIBBS: The same crewmen with him in Rota work the flight deck here? 
 BURLEY: All of them are on Chief Petty Officer Reyes' crew. 
 GIBBS: Anyone else suspected of using, Stan? 
 BURLEY: Not so far. 
 GIBBS: Good. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BURLEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
 KATE: What buddies were with him that night? 
 BURLEY: Petty Officers Niles and Shrewe. They berth on deck five. designator five, fifty-six, two, L. 
 KATE: I'll be fine. Oh, and this is for you from Ducky.(KATE WALKS O.S.) 
 TONY: If Wilkes was tweaking, Reyes would have noticed. 
 BURLEY: I didn't get much out of Reyes in my interview. You're welcome to try. 
 GIBBS: You're looking good, Stan. 
 BURLEY: I appreciate you coming, boss. 
 GIBBS: (TO TONY) You waiting on something? 
 TONY: Oh no. I'm gone. 
 (TONY WALKS O.S.) 
 GIBBS: I'd like to see Wilkes in action. Can you get me deck tapes of him during flight ops? 
 BURLEY: Only about a hundred hours. 
 GIBBS: Is that all?

 INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
 SEAMAN: Excuse me, Ma'am.(VOICE OVER P.A. B.G.) 
 SEAMAN ONE: Uh...can I help you, Ma'am? 
 KATE: This isn't the deck five berthing compartment, is it? 
 SEAMAN ONE: This is the men's head on deck six, Ma'am. 
 KATE: Uh, sorry. How do I get to deck five? 
 SEAMAN ONE: You go aft, past bulkhead one twenty six, down the starboard ladder, through the hatch. 
 KATE: Thanks. 
 SEAMAN ONE: Ma'am? Ma'am? Aft. 
 (SFX: SEAMAN URINATES) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SICK BAY - DAY 
 WILKES: That's impossible. I don't use drugs. 
 GIBBS: Your blood test says otherwise. 
 WILKES: Then it must be a false positive. 
 GIBBS: Before you joined up, you were an emergency medical tech. You tell me how often that usually happens. Maybe it's just a whim. Or maybe you like hanging out in walk-in freezers in your birthday suit. 
 WILKES: I don't know what happened, Sir. I was feeling light headed and hot. Really hot. 
 GIBBS: Well your body temperature was a hundred and six. That's high enough to kill most men, unless their cardiovascular system was being boosted by some sort of synthetic stimulant. 
 WILKES: Somebody must have slipped something into my drink. 
 GIBBS: Any idea who that someone might have been? 
 WILKES: No, Sir. 
 GIBBS: Any idea who provided the meth? 
 WILKES: No, Sir! 
 GIBBS: You know what, I'm trying to help you out here, Petty Officer. If you try to float this story at your court martial hearing, they will laugh your ass all the way to Leavenworth. Where did you get it? Shrewe? 
 WILKES: No! 
 GIBBS: From Niles? 
 WILKES: I don't do drugs! And no one else on my crew does either! 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BERTHING COMPARTMENT - DAY 
 KATE: Deck five berthing? 
 CREWMAN: Yes, ma'am. 
 KATE: Thank god. 
 CREWMAN: Ma'am, it's S.O.P women are supposed to announce themselves in designated male quarters of the ship. 
 KATE: NCIS Special Agent Kate Todd. I'm announced. Can you tell me where I can find Petty Officers Niles and Shrewe? 
 CREWMAN: I haven't seen Shrew lately, but Niles just went up to work out in the hangar bay. 
 KATE: Hangar bay? 
 CREWMAN: Deck one, frame number one fifty, the compartment next to usage Q. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. HANGAR BAY - DAY 
 (SFX: WEIGHTS CLANG B.G.) 
 NILES: I'll be honest with you, Ma'am. I did my fair share of partying when I was in high school, experimented with pot and all that. 
 KATE: You still experimenting? 
 NILES: Absolutely not, Ma'am. Wildest I get now is a pitcher of sangria and a couple of beers. I'd never even consider something like meth. 
 KATE: What about Petty Officer Wilkes? 
 NILES: Solid as they come, Ma'am. Fourth generation Navy. His grandfather was a gunner's mate on the Arizona. Wilkes would never disgrace the uniform. 
 KATE: Well, I've got news for you, Petty Officer Niles. He did. 
 NILES: I can't explain it, Ma'am. 
 KATE: Can't or won't? 
 NILES: Code of silence stuff doesn't fly too well on the Flight Deck, Ma'am. There's no room for screw ups. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BRIDGE - DAY 
 ARBRING: We're being temporarily rerouted to assist in a search and rescue. A private yacht has gone missing. We are closest to the area so the Coast Guard has requested our help. It's a shame really. So close to home and these men now have to turn around and go back. 
 GIBBS: That's why you're resuming flight ops. 
 ARBRING: If there's a drug problem, I need it stopped. I need to know who it is and why testing procedures haven't picked it up. 
 GIBBS: We'll do the best we can, Skipper. 
 ARBRING: I'm sure you will. Lives depend on it.

 FADE IN: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
 CHIEF REYES: (SHOUTS) That wire's looking tired, gentlemen! Strip wire! Move! Move! Double time! let's go! Today, gentlemen! Hurry up! Thirty seconds and the next landing's on top of you! We're not sunbathing, Hancock! Let's go! Let's go! Not up to speed. Two seconds slower than the last time. All right. Stand by. We've got an E-two landing in five minutes. (TO TONY) I heard NCIS was bringing in the cavalry.(DIALOGUE OVER ACTION/MEN RACE TO THE DECK TO PREPARE FOR TAKEOFF) 
 TONY: Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. You're pushing your guys pretty hard, Chief, considering it's just a search and rescue run. 
 CHIEF REYES: I always push my men hard, Sir. They've got to be ready. Tomorrow it might not be search and rescue. We might be back in the soup in Iraq. 
 TONY: Still, don't you ever lay off, give your men a break? 
 CHIEF REYES: My philosophy is if you got to do a job, you got to do it right one hundred and ten percent. That's why my men are the best, Sir. 
 TONY: How did Petty Officer Wilkes handle being pushed? 
 CHIEF REYES: He does okay. 
 TONY: Ever show any signs of stress? 
 CHIEF REYES: Fourteen hours a day on a flight deck during combat Ops, everyone shows signs of stress, Sir. 
 TONY: You ever notice anything unusual in his behavior? Anxiety attacks? Irritability? Mood swings? 
 CHIEF REYES: Not that I ever saw, Sir. If there's nothing else, I've got to prepare for the next aircraft, Sir. 
 AIR BOSS: (V.O.) Ready Decky Two. Call the ball. 
 PILOT: (V.O.) Roger. One ball two point five. 
 SHREWE: (SHOUTS) The ball! Did he call the ball!? Did the flier call the meatball?

 (DOOR OPENS/ CLOSES) 
 CORPSMAN: You don't know for certain, but I don't think he's in any real danger now. I've got him pretty heavily sedated. 
 GIBBS: What does it look like? 
 CORPSMAN: I really won't know until the tox report comes through. 
 GIBBS: I appreciate that, Doc, but I don't have time to wait for a tox report. In your considerable experience, what's your best guess? 
 CORPSMAN: It looks like the same situation we have with Petty Officer Wilkes. 
 KATE: Methamphetamines? 
 CORPSMAN: Most likely. 
 GIBBS: Chronic, long term use? 
 CORPSMAN: With his symptoms, it would have to be. 
 TONY: Yet his last random piss test was negative, just like Petty Officer Wilkes. 
 CORPSMAN: Well, it doesn't make much sense. 
 GIBBS: No, it doesn't. When can I talk with him? 
 CORPSMAN: Well, that's hard for me to say, Agent Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: Well, let me make it easier for you, Doc. Fifteen hundred. Consciousness will make the interview go much smoother. 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) Toss Shrewe's rack. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. HANGAR BAY - DAY 
 TONY: Got it. 
 GIBBS: Go over everything, and I mean everything. Above his mattress, below his mattress, inside his mattress. If there's such a thing as a fourth mattress dimension, go over that, too. Find out where the Urinalysis Coordinator likes to let it all hang out. 
 KATE: Okay. 
 GIBBS: I want to find out about this testing procedure. How it all works. See if there's any way that anyone can beat it. You and me, we're gonna have a flight deck film festival. See if you can arrange some place we can watch those tapes. 
 BURLEY: I have one of the ready rooms on hold, boss. 
 GIBBS: Always anticipating, Stan. Some things never change. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. BERTHING AREA - DAY 
 TONY: Can I help you, Petty Officer? 
 NILES: Lot of messy racks around here lately. 
 TONY: Gonna be a lot more 'till we find what we're looking for. 
 NILES: No disrespect, Sir, but like I told your partner, none of the guys on my crew.... 
 TONY: (OVERLAP)...on my crew use drugs. I've heard the party line so many times it's like a bad song I can't get out of my head. 
 NILES: You don't understand, Sir! 
 TONY: I do understand! Two of your guys are in sick bay with enough meth in their bloodstreams to kill a herd of Navy goats. For a crew that doesn't do drugs, you guys sure do a lot of drugs. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. READY ROOM - DAY 
 BURLEY: (V.O.) Got ants in his pants? 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) Question is, who's putting them there? 
 BURLEY: Rota was our last liberty port after we left the Gulf. 
 GIBBS: This tape was done before they hit Rota. 
 BURLEY: Well, maybe he stocked up at Naples or Nice. 
 GIBBS: Is that the best you can do, Stan, after working under me five years? 
 BURLEY: Well, at least I don't taint evidence when I bag and tag. 
 GIBBS: I tripped. One time. 
 BURLEY: As I remember, it was because your eyes were glued to some little... 
 GIBBS: Do you mind if we get back to tape now? 
 BURLEY: Sure, boss. 
 GIBBS: We have a job to do, remember? 
 BURLEY: I do, boss. 
 GIBBS: Good. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
 KATE: Petty Officer. 
 GOMEZ: Ma'am? 
 KATE: You just came out of the Urinalysis Coordinator's office. 
 GOMEZ: I hope not, ma'am. I just got a hair cut in there. 
 KATE: Go ahead. Tell me how many bulkheads, hatches and passageways I have to traverse to get there. 
 GOMEZ: It's right next door. 
 KATE: Of course it is. Thank you, Petty Officer. 
 GOMEZ: No problem, Ma'am. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NORSKI'S OFFICE - DAY 
 NORSKI: We don't do the actual testing on board. What we do is we collect the samples and record the data and ship them off to a land-based lab. 
 KATE: Obviously with such a large crew, you test them in batches. 
 NORSKI: The computer generates a random list - about twenty five or thirty a day. 
 KATE: Do you....watch? 
 NORSKI: Of course we watch. Someone from security accompanies them to the head and observes casually by mirror. 
 KATE: And if someone wanted to beat it? 
 NORSKI: Ma'am? 
 KATE: (BEAT) The system. 
 NORSKI: Oh. They try. Detox drinks, herbal tea, vinegar. Some try slipping bleach crystals in. Or even passing off a shipmate's clean sample as their own. 
 KATE: How do they do that if they're being watched? 
 NORSKI: You fill it up with someone else's urine, slip the balloon in your underwear and tape the tube to the underside of you... 
 KATE: Ah, I get the picture. Obviously it didn't work. 
 NORSKI: Well, balloons aren't the sturdiest of containers. If you want to examine it... 
 KATE: That won't be necessary. How about the other methods that you mentioned? 
 NORSKI: Most of them don't fly. But every once in a while one does slip through. No system's perfect. 
 KATE: How about twice within six weeks? 
 NORSKI: Unlikely, but like I said, anything's possible. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
 TONY: Lost?(DOOR CLOSES) 
 KATE: No. 
 TONY: How's it going? 
 KATE: What do you mean? 
 TONY: You know what I mean. Finding your way around the ship and all. 
 KATE: It's going fine. 
 TONY: Good, I'm glad. Really glad. 
 KATE: I admit, it was a little confusing at first. I had a few... you know... 
 TONY: False starts. 
 KATE: Complete disasters. But I think I've got a pretty good handle on it now. 
 TONY: Good. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SICKBAY - DAY 
 GIBBS: This is the second time I have had to come down here to talk to a member of your crew. 
 SHREWE: I don't know what to tell you, Sir. 
 GIBBS: Why don't you tell me how two members of the same crew who work the same team flip out on meth within a few days of each other? 
 SHREWE: Meth? 
 GIBBS: Yeah. It's a fine white powder cooked up in trailer parks. Makes people do funny things, like freak out on a flight deck with a plane on final approach. 
 SHREWE: Sir, there's gotta be a mistake. I've never done drugs. 
 GIBBS: Never? 
 SHREWE: Not once in my life, Sir. It's against my morals. I feel the same way about alcohol and tobacco. 
 GIBBS: Is that so? 
 SHREWE: Yes, Sir. I even reported a guy for smoking some pot on my last cruise. 
 GIBBS: Well, it makes a nice story to cover your own ass in case they catch you with the real deal. 
 SHREWE: I'm telling the truth, Sir.

 MUSIC IN: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
 VOICE OVER P.A.: (V.O.) ...Gentlemen. Keep your eyes peeled. Don't miss a thing. 
 GIBBS: Wilkes was killed, probably because he was going to give up the supplier. 
 TONY: Makes sense. 
 KATE: Yeah, well what makes no sense is that these boys are involved at all. Now Wilkes was a proud Navy legacy, and Shrewe was a Boy Scout. 
 GIBBS: That's what they want you to think. Drugs addicts learn the art of the con fast. 
 KATE: Well, I had the lab that tested the urine samples send them to Abby for retesting. 
 GIBBS: Good. 
 TONY: Where's Burley? 
 GIBBS: Watching more flight deck footage. 
 TONY: Still? 
 GIBBS: Yeah, he's been at it almost eighteen hours now. He's always been this way. I'll see how he's doing. 
 (GIBBS WALKS O.S.) 
 KATE: It's not the same thing you know. 
 TONY: What? 
 KATE: Well, you and Gibbs, Burley and Gibbs. 
 TONY: What are you talking about? 
 KATE: It was a different dynamic, you know, a different time. You can't compare the relationships. 
 TONY: Who's comparing? 
 KATE: All I'm saying is that things on the surface are not always the same as when you put them in context with the way they actually developed, you know, under the surface... kind of. 
 TONY: I have no idea what you said. 
 KATE: Neither do I. But the intent was sincere. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: Petty Officer Robert Wilkes. You are a bit of a puzzle, aren't you, my lad? A secured room, no sign of trauma. 
 JACKSON: No bruising or ligature marks. 
 DUCKY: Let's rule out strangulation; if that's okay by you. 
 JACKSON: Color's good. No cyanosis. 
 DUCKY: You weren't suffocated by a pillow. Poisoned, perhaps? Well, we'll soon see. You'll tell Ducky everything eventually. They all do, you know.

 GIBBS: You want to fill me in here? 
 BURLEY: This is interesting. 
 (BURLEY AND GIBBS WATCH THE MONITOR) 
 GIBBS: What is Chief Petty Officer Reyes handing them? 
 BURLEY: It's hard to tell from this distance. 
 GIBBS: Can you get closer? 
 BURLEY: We'll have to enhance the tape.

 KATE: He runs his crew hard. 
 AIR BOSS: And they appreciate him for it. 
 TONY: Aside from the two incidents, have you noticed anything out of the ordinary the past few weeks? 
 AIR BOSS: Not unless you consider a fifty percent above average performance out of the ordinary. 
 KATE: That's quite a record. 
 AIR BOSS: With two new guys, he's falling behind a little but that's expected. He'll get them up to speed. He always does. 
 (CAMERA ANGLE CLOSE ON CHIEF REYES) 
 CHIEF REYES: Come on! Let's go! Work it! Work it!(CHIEF REYES CONTINUES B.G.) 
 KATE: Why get them up to speed at all? It's only a rescue mission after which they're going home. 
 AIR BOSS: Because that's Chief Reyes, Ma'am. 
 CHIEF REYES: (SHOUTS/V.O.) Work it out! Work it out!

Think this wasn't a race, huh? You just thought it was an exercise! Well, well. We finally found something you're good at, Hatcher. Lying down! What are you looking at, Stewart? Did I say stop? Give me twenty five more! Let's go! Let's go! 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: Well here is Petty Officer Wilkes with an I.V. drip going into his arm. (ON MONITOR) Please, Gerald, this is not dinner theater. Suppose someone (ON CAMERA) disconnected his I.V. tube at both ends and blew (V.O.) all the liquid out of the tube, leaving (ON MONITOR) nothing but air. Suppose they emptied the (ON CAMERA) saline bag half way... that should be about it. The I.V. tube is attached. This blue balloon taped to Gerald's arm represents his vein. (V.O.) And the valve is inserted (ON MONITOR) into the bag. Air (ON CAMERA) is blown into the tube using this one way valve. The air is trapped. When I open the flow rate valve, and squeeze, air is pushed down the tube and into the vein and death occurs....oh, within sixty seconds.

 DUCKY: (ON MONITOR) I do apologize. 
 TONY: So that's what killed Wilkes? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: I'm pretty certain. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: Any way the air could have gotten into the line accidentally? 
 DUCKY: (ON MONITOR) Normal air is less than one percent carbon dioxide. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: The gas bubble in Wilkes' heart was six percent c-oh-two. 
 GERALD: That's not air, that was breath. It was deliberate. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: So Duck, this would have had to have been done by someone with medical knowledge? 
 GERALD: (ON MONITOR) Most certainly. 
 DUCKY: (ON MONITOR) You're supposed to be dead. 
 KATE: I'll see what I can find. 
 GIBBS: I'll have Burley meet me in sickbay.(KATE AND GIBBS WALK O.S.)

 GIBBS: Not unless you were supplying him methamphetamines and you were afraid he would talk. 
 MILANO: I wasn't. 
 GIBBS: Your prints were all over that saline bag. 
 MILANO: Sir, I was the attending corpsman. My prints are supposed to be on that bag. Petty Officer Wilkes was alive when I went to change that bag out. When I came back he was dead. That's the truth, Sir. Give me a polygraph, anything! But that is the truth.

 BURLEY: Yes, boss. 
 GIBBS: I mean, that is why you called me, right? 
 BURLEY: Gee, it's funny how it's all starting to come back to me now. 
 GIBBS: What's that? 
 BURLEY: The tightness in my chest, the upset stomach. All the pleasantries that come with working for you. 
 GIBBS: Your breathing's not labored. You're fine. What have you got? 
 BURLEY: There were a second set of prints on the saline bag. 
 GIBBS: Wilkes. 
 BURLEY: You knew he used to be an EMT. 
 GIBBS: You think he killed himself? 
 BURLEY: One of the doctors bent a few rules, let Wilkes take a call from his father. His very proud... retired Chief Petty Officer father. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. READY ROOM 
 ABBY: (ON MONITOR) So Wilkes' urine was clean. No nasty metabolites, no additives. (BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: There's just one tiny problem. Look at this. (V.O.) It's the exact (ON CAMERA) same urine as Petty Officer Shrewe.(SFX: BEEP TONES) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: Someone's replacing their samples. 
 TONY: The Urinalysis Coordinator? 
 KATE: Maybe. Or maybe one of the twenty five Masters at Arms he uses to monitor. (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: We need to look at the records of all the people on pee patrol. 
 ABBY: (ON MONITOR) So is anybody happy about this? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: Is anybody freaked out? It would be nice to have somebody here. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: Sorry, Abby. It's just that we've both really got to go. 
 ABBY: (ON MONITOR) What do you want me to do with all this pee? 
 (END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
 TONY: No, it's three seventy six nine A. We're at five forty five seven E. We need to go up two levels, over to port and then three bulkheads aft. 
 KATE: No, which is why we need to up one level so we can traverse port before heading out. 
 TONY: The ladder two bulkheads down takes us up and across. Is this going to turn into one of those guy/girl things where you insist we stop and ask for directions? 
 KATE: Oh, no. Because unlike you, I know where I'm going. 
 TONY: Then be my guest. I'll be in Admin! 
 (MUSIC OVER ACTION/KATE AND TONY WALK IN THE CORRIDORS) 
 (VOICE OVER P.A. B.G.) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 CLERK: Can I help you? 
 KATE: Special Agent Kate Todd, NCIS. I need to see some record books, please.

 SEAMAN: (V.O.) Excuse me, Sir. 
 ABBY: (V.O.) I was able to bring it way up. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 ABBY: Take a look at this.(BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 BURLEY: Much better. 
 GIBBS: Right there! Abby, can you get us in closer? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: Patience, Gibbs. You can't rush art. (V.O.) Smart money says (ON CAMERA) that that is not a Tic Tac. 
 (END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
 (SFX: JET LANDS B.G.) 
 CHIEF REYES: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
 GIBBS: Chief Reyes? 
 CHIEF REYES: Yes. 
 GIBBS: We haven't been introduced. Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS. You already know Special Agent Burley. 
 CHIEF REYES: What can I do for you, Sir? 
 GIBBS: You can give me one of those capsules you gave Petty Officer Wilkes during Flight Ops. 
 CHIEF REYES: Sir? 
 BURLEY: We have it all on a flight deck tape, Chief. 
 CHIEF REYES: You can see a capsule from that camera up there? 
 GIBBS: We had it digitally enhanced. I can see the hairs standing up on the back of your neck. 
 CHIEF REYES: What do you think those are, Sir? 
 BURLEY: Meth, Chief. 
 CHIEF REYES: Meth? That's ninety eight percent caffeine. Available over the counter at any pharmacy in Norfolk. Coffee's not allowed on the deck so I give it to my men to keep them going. I would never do anything to jeopardize these men, Sir. I love these men....and I would die for these men. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 FADE IN: 
 INT. BURLEY'S OFFICE 
 BURLEY: Standard test pouches. Just like I used in Baltimore. 
 GIBBS: Yeah, DiNozzo was a Baltimore cop before coming to us. 
 BURLEY: Is that right? How long? 
 TONY: Almost two years. 
 BURLEY: And before that? 
 TONY: Philly P.D. 
 KATE: Eighteen months, right? 
 TONY: There were extenuating circumstances. 
 KATE: And what was before Philly, I forgot. Pittsburgh? 
 TONY: Peoria. 
 KATE: Right. 
 TONY: And it doesn't matter how long. All that matters now is that I'm here at NCIS. 
 KATE: Oh, and you've been here for um... refresh my memory... 
 TONY: Two years. What did you do before NCIS, Burley? 
 BURLEY: Ah, just pushing papers around in Washington. 
 TONY: Well, I'm sure it wasn't so bad. 
 GIBBS: How bad can being a Senator's Aide be? 
 BURLEY: It wasn't me. 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo, the kit. 
 TONY: Yeah. The way it works? Simple. Place a small sample of the suspected substance inside the pouch. Seal it. Break the ampoule inside the pouch which releases the test chemicals. If the clear liquid turns a color, we have drugs. (BEAT) Not meth. 
 GIBBS: Well, that pouch might be clear, but my gut's still in living color. All right, get a search authorization. Sweep Chief Petty Officer Reyes' rack. Wait until he's occupied with Flight Ops in the morning. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
 (SFX: JET LANDS B.G.) 
 CHIEF REYES: (SHOUTS) Now! Now! Now! Now! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! 
 AIR BOSS: (V.O./FILTERED) Bridge. Air Boss. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BRIDGE - DAY 
 ARBRING: (INTO RADIO) Go Boss. 
 AIR BOSS: (OVER P.A.) Skipper, Mauler Two has located the yacht. There are survivors in the water. One hundred and fifty three miles out on two six zero. 
 ARBRING: (INTO RADIO) Launch the rescue bird. 
 AIR BOSS: (V.O./FILTERED) Aye aye, Sir. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. REYES' QUARTERS 
 BURLEY: There's nothing here. 
 KATE: Nothing that's obvious anyway. 
 TONY: I say it's time we turn off the lights and play in the dark. 
 (PASSAGE OF TIME) 
 TONY: Anywhere Chief Petty Officer Reyes touches can leave residue. 
 KATE: I might have something here. 
 BURLEY: Could be toothpaste. 
 TONY: Could be meth. Bag it. 
 KATE: Hold it. Tony? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BURLEY'S OFFICE 
 (TONY TESTS THE SUBSTANCE) 
 TONY: No, it looks the same as the Alert capsule we tested. 
 KATE: You think we're barking up the wrong tree? 
 GIBBS: Actually, I was thinking just the opposite. Why have the contents of an Alert capsule loose on your locker shelf? 
 BURLEY: Unless you emptied it so you can fill it up with something else. 
 KATE: Then why didn't we find traces of speed? 
 TONY: Because you can be sure Reyes is taking extra precautions with a substance that can put him away. 
 KATE: Okay. Then how do we link Reyes to the meth? 
 GIBBS: By going to the one guy from the original crew who still might be holding some. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. HANGAR BAY - DAY 
 (NILES WORKS OUT ON THE BAG B.G.) 
 GIBBS: Whoa, a little jumpy today, Petty Officer. 
 NILES: Nah, you know, I just get a little nervous when it gets close to duty time. 
 GIBBS: Reyes works you hard on that flight deck. 
 NILES: Yes, Sir. You've got to keep on top of it. 
 GIBBS: Sounds exhausting to me. 
 NILES: Nothing I can't handle, Sir. 
 GIBBS: Especially when you have yourself a little pick me up. 
 NILES: Sir, I don't know how many times we gotta go over this, but I... 
 GIBBS: (OVERLAP) This is the last time, I promise. My crew is tossing your rack as we speak. 
 NILES: They're not going to find anything. 
 GIBBS: Maybe that's because you have it on you. 
 NILES: You want to search me? Go ahead. But I'm telling you the only pick me up I use is a cup of coffee before I go on duty and a couple of these when I'm on deck! 
 GIBBS: Mind if I hang onto these? 
 NILES: No, Sir! 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. BURLEY'S OFFICE 
 BURLEY: Meth disguised as caffeine capsules. 
 GIBBS: I'm assuming you didn't find anything in Petty Officer Niles' rack. 
 TONY: Clean as a whistle. 
 KATE: They've been telling the truth all along. They were getting hooked and they didn't even know they were using. 
 BURLEY: How in the hell could a Chief feed his own guys speed? 
 KATE: Are we going to bring him in now? 
 GIBBS: Not yet. All we have is a Petty Officer in possession who claims his highly regarded superior gave it to him without his knowledge. 
 BURLEY: Won't fly well with JAG. 
 GIBBS: We want to get him with the evidence in hand. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. PRI-FLY - DAY 
 (SFX: JET LANDS B.G.) 
 AIR BOSS: I'm a little worried about your crew, Chief. They're not where they should be. 
 CHIEF REYES: I'm pushing them, Sir, but I've got two new guys. 
 AIR BOSS: Then push them harder. Your boys have to be sharp. 
 CHIEF REYES: They will be, Sir. 
 AIR BOSS: I hope so, Chief. This will be our last Ops before we head back home. I'd sure hate to go out on a low note, not after what we've all accomplished. 
 CHIEF REYES: I won't let you down, Sir. 
 AIR BOSS: I know you won't. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. BRIDGE - DAY 
 XO: The Air Boss, Sir. 
 AIR BOSS: (V.O./FILTERED) I didn't like it, Skipper, but I did it.

 (BURLEY/TONY AND KATE WALK INTO THE ROOM) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NORSKI'S OFFICE 
 TONY: As you have probably already guessed, we're not here to make a deposit. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 KATE: More like a withdrawal, actually. 
 NORSKI: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. 
 BURLEY: Oh, I think you do, Lieutenant. Your service record indicates you and Chief Reyes have served on three different ships together. 
 KATE: On each one, the Chief's crew had the distinction of maintaining the highest performance rating. 
 TONY: Thanks, of course, to his capsules and your help in covering up the urine tests. 
 BURLEY: It's over, Lieutenant. Before you pee in your pants, why don't you show us where he keeps his stash. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
 (MUSIC OVER ACTION/HELO LANDS AND UNLOADS PASSENGERS)

 INT. HANGAR BAY - DAY 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 CHIEF REYES: Why the hell aren't you on the flight deck, Niles? 
 NILES: I don't know, Chief. I ain't felling so hot right now. 
 CHIEF REYES: What do you mean you don't know? We've got aircraft coming in! 
 NILES: I'm beat, man. I don't know what's wrong with me. 
 CHIEF REYES: You've got to get it together, Petty Officer. You've got to suck it up! 
 NILES: I don't think I can, Chief. 
 CHIEF REYES: Come here. This should help you out. 
 NILES: Just one, Chief? 
 CHIEF REYES: Now get the hell on the deck. 
 (MUSIC OVER ACTION/NILES LOOKS AT CHIEF REYES) 
 CHIEF REYES: That's okay, son. You followed orders. That's what a good sailor does. Go on, now. 
 GIBBS: Thanks. 
 CHIEF REYES: These men spent ten months in the Gulf, combat conditions. Twelve hours a day, one hundred and ten degrees on the deck. 
 GIBBS: With you in their face, pumping them up with meth. 
 CHIEF REYES: I gave my men something to help them do their jobs better, and it worked. 
 GIBBS: Explain that to Wilkes's family. 
 CHIEF REYES: I'm sorry about what happened, but I'm not going to make excuses. We got our planes on the deck and out of harms way faster than any other crew. Wilkes was a casualty of war, Agent Gibbs. A hero. 
 GIBBS: Yes, he was, Chief. He was also a victim of a leader who betrayed his trust. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
 BURLEY: I have to say it was like déja vu working with you again, boss. 
 GIBBS: Good déja vu or bad? 
 BURLEY: Good. 
 GIBBS AND BURLEY: (IN UNISON) And bad. 
 BURLEY: You know, boss, in all seriousness, you know how much it means to me that... 
 GIBBS: Ah hell, Stan, you're gonna get all huggy on me? 
 BURLEY: I guess I'm not. 
 GIBBS: I didn't think so. 'Bye. 
 BURLEY: 'Bye. 
 KATE: See you, Stan. Thanks. 
 (GIBBS AND KATE WALK O.S.) 
 TONY: You know, in the two years I've worked for Gibbs, he's never shaken my hand once. Never. 
 BURLEY: I was in the office two years before he even looked me in the eye. 
 TONY: Really? 
 BURLEY: And three weeks before he called me by name. Four 'till he got it right. By then I'd actually gotten used to Steve. He must really like you. 
 TONY: Thanks. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. COD - DAY 
 GIBBS: The CAT launch is like the wire landing, only in reverse. We go from zero to a hundred and forty knots in a second and a half. 
 TONY: It's kind of like s*x without all that work. 
 KATE: Everything is like s*x to you, Tony. 
 GIBBS: Cross your arms, chin to your chest. Lean forward as far as you can. 
 KATE: And breathe normally. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
 (MUSIC OVER ACTION/COD LAUNCHES) 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) How are you doing, Kate? Kate? DiNozzo, how's she doing?
