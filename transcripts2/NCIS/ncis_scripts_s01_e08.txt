 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 
 BIKER CHICK: You promised I'd be back by now. 
 BIKER: Don't get your thong in a knot. 
 BIKER CHICK: Yeah, well if my old man finds out I've been biking with you, he'll kill us both. 
 BIKER: If your man was a man, I might be worried. 
 BIKER CHICK: Wayne, you've got to get me back. I'm serious. 
 BIKER: I'll get you a ride.(CAMERA ANGLE ON CAR AS THE CAR DRIVES CLOSER) 
 BIKER CHICK: What if he doesn't stop? 
 BIKER: Oh he'll stop. (SHOUTS) Hey! Stop!

 FADE IN: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 "MINIMUM SECURITY" 
 DUCKY: Massive internal bleeding in the abdominal cavity, Gerald. That's enough. My young friend, you must have been in acute pain...for many hours. What kept you from seeking help, I wonder? Run the gut for me, would you please, Gerald? 
 GERALD: Not a problem. 
 DUCKY: It was definitely a blockage. It's strange, though. It seems to consist of a cluster of objects. 
 GERALD: Gall stones? 
 DUCKY: Oh, my no. Gallstones that large could never pass through the cystic duct. And even if they did, they wouldn't all be expelled at the same time. Although I did find a gall bladder once with almost a kilo of large stones. Of course the victim was a sumo wrestler who weighed over two hundred kilos. He was in the middle of a bout - he just went... 
 (DUCKY MAKES DEATH F/X) 
 GERALD: They're stones, Doc. 
 DUCKY: Not gall stones. 
 (PASSAGE OF TIME) 
 DUCKY: (V.O.) Emeralds. It was lodged in his gastrointestinal tract causing perforation of the peritoneum, internal bleeding, infection and death. 
 GIBBS: He swallowed emeralds. 
 DUCKY: He did indeed. 
 GIBBS: I'm going to take a wild guess here, Doc. He smuggled them into the country. 
 DUCKY: It's from where he smuggled them in, Jethro. Our sailor had just arrived from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he was a translator. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: Petty Officer Second Class Kahlil Sa'id. Naturalized American citizen, born in Egypt. Worked as a translator at Camp Delta. Fluent in Arabic, Uyghur and Pashto. Died in his car on Route Five Twenty Two near Fredericksburg. Almost killed a pair of bikers. 
 TONY: Vroom vroom bikers or pedal bikers? 
 KATE: I said bikers, Tony. Not cyclists. 
 TONY: Bikers is a term that refers to all cyclists.... 
 GIBBS: Next of kin? 
 KATE: None in the States. No US address either. And apparently he rotated from our Naval Station in Bahrain to Gitmo five months ago. 
 GIBBS: Where did he get those emeralds? 
 TONY: Gitmo Exchange. Sorry. 
 GIBBS: Get your gear. We're going to Gitmo. 
 TONY: Ha. Ha. That's a good one, boss. He was kidding, right? 
 KATE: I don't think so. 
 TONY: We're going to Cuba?!(TONY LAUGHS) 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 ABBY: Hey, Gibbs. I've got a gemologist coming over to look at the rocks. It's my mother's friend's sister's son. 
 GIBBS: Does he know his stuff? 
 ABBY: I went out with him like once. Didn't get very far. 
 GIBBS: Is this all from the car? 
 ABBY: Yeah. It was a rental. 
 GIBBS: Any classified material? 
 ABBY: Not in the suitcases. 
 GIBBS: He would've swapped his hard drive before he left. Check it anyway. 
 ABBY: These were in the suitcase. Stamped, no postmark. All the same return address. 
 GIBBS: NCIS Special Agent Paula Cassidy. 
 ABBY: You know her? 
 GIBBS: No. But I will. 
 ABBY: Okay, smell this. 
 GIBBS: Does this turn you on, Abby? 
 ABBY: It turned somebody on. Box of condoms, half empty. The price tag says they're from the Gitmo Exchange. Maybe... maybe it was a package deal. 
 GIBBS: See if you can brand the cologne. 
 ABBY: You want some? 
 GIBBS: Nope, don't use cologne. Women I date think the smell of saw dust is sexy. That's why I don't date very many women.

 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
 (SFX: ELEVATOR DINGS) 
 TONY: Oh! Sorry. 
 GIBBS: You had better have a good reason for spilling my coffee. 
 TONY: I do. I booked us on the first A-M-C flight to Gitmo tomorrow. 
 GIBBS: Un-book it. 
 TONY: Ha ha! I knew it! I told her you were pulling my leg. 
 GIBBS: Navy's giving us a priority ride today. 
 TONY: You mean it? You do mean it.(ELEVATOR DINGS) 
 (ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE SHUT) 
 TONY: Normally I hate priority rides, but who cares if it's going... 
 GIBBS: What's wrong with priority rides? 
 TONY: Come on, boss. You tell me you like sitting on canvas seats slung between cargo pallets? 
 GIBBS: Yeah, it makes me feel like I'm back in the Corps. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY 
 (ACTION CONTINUES/JET TAKES OFF) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. JET - FLYING 
 TONY: Oh, I love priority rides! Boss this is the best! 
 GIBBS: I miss canvas seats. 
 TONY: Check this out. What do you want? 
 GIBBS: Get to work. 
 TONY: I already started. (READS) "Guantanamo enjoys a year round tropical climate cooled by the breezes from the Windward Passage. Some of the more popular pastimes include skin diving, sunbathing and horseback riding." 
 KATE: I would be the last one to rain on your parade, Fidel, but you're logged onto an official Navy website. It's P.R. 
 GIBBS: This isn't. It's the NCIS file on Special Agent Paul Cassidy. She's an interrogator at Camp Delta. Special Agent Cassidy is not to know that Sa'id is dead. 
 KATE: We're not working with her? 
 GIBBS: Sa'id was carrying five unmailed letters of hers. Until we find out how she was involved with him, she's out of the loop. 
 TONY: I can't believe we're in a forty million dollar Gulfstream. I mean, it's got to be C.N.O.'s or SECNAV's. You know, Tiger Woods has one of these. Tom Cruise - all the big movie stars. This is their ride. 
 GIBBS: Tony? 
 TONY: Yeah, boss? 
 GIBBS: Can we get to work? 
 TONY: Sure thing. Just check this out. (LAUGHS) It's a Gulfstream. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY 
 KATE: So much for the element of surprise. 
 CASSIDY: Welcome to Gitmo. I'm Special Agent Paula Cassidy. 
 GIBBS: Special Agent Jethro Gibbs. Special Agent Kate Todd. 
 KATE: Hi. 
 CASSIDY: How are you? 
 GIBBS: Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. 
 TONY: Hey. 
 CASSIDY: Hello. I heard you all were coming. Nice ride. 
 TONY: You are so right there. 
 CASSIDY: This is yours. There's a map in it. They put you up in one of the nicest houses on the base. 
 GIBBS: I appreciate that Special Agent Cassidy. 
 CASSIDY: So is there something going down that I should know about? 
 GIBBS: No. 
 CASSIDY: It's just that all my transcripts have been pulled, my interrogations have been cancelled, and then you all arrive on the Navy Gulfstream. How would you connect the dots?(CAR DOORS OPEN/CLOSE) 
 GIBBS: I wouldn't. 
 (SFX: CAR STARTS)

 INT. BEDROOM 
 TONY: No way! 
 KATE: It's the only bedroom with a bath. 
 TONY: I know. And I picked it first. 
 KATE: Women take baths. Men take showers, Tony. 
 TONY: Why does the woman thing come up when a ship is sinking or when there's only one bedroom with a bath?

 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) In the morning. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) My mother's very excited. 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Find anything else? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, I picked up another scent on his shorts and his t-shirts. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) What did Sa'id do, bathe in the stuff? 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) No, it's not his. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) It's uh... peach and musk with vanilla as a top note. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) It's definitely feminine. 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Well, tag it. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Perfume is expensive, Gibbs. I can't just hang out at... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) ...the Macy's tester tray with my lab kit. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) They frown on that sort of behavior.

 GIBBS: I appreciate that. I'm going to bed. Talk to you manana. 
 (GIBBS WALKS INTO THE BEDROOM/TOSSES THE LUGGAGE INTO THE HALLWAY)

 BENJAMIN: Where'd you get this, Abby? 
 ABBY: If I told you I'd have to kill you, Benjamin. This is very sweet, but you did not have to bring me a gift. 
 BENJAMIN: Oh, I wanted to. Your mother said it was something you could use. 
 ABBY: Oh, right on. Thanks! Benjamin, this is...this is great. (BEAT) So the emerald. Is it real? 
 BENJAMIN: Oh, it's very real. Color grade two point five, tone one to two, clarity I-one. It's at least worth twenty thousand. And the color is quite distinct. It's bluish apple green. And the fluid inclusions are quite different from Colombian stones. This emerald was mined in the Panjshir Valley. 
 ABBY: Where's that? 
 BENJAMIN: Afghanistan.

 GIBBS: William Gamal. 
 GAMAL: It's Bill. Senior translator, Camp Delta. 
 GIBBS: We've been expecting you. Special Agent Gibbs, Special Agent DiNozzo and Todd. 
 TONY: When the FBI relaxes the dress code, they sure go for it. 
 GAMAL: These are the transcripts of the interrogations of Nasir Al Jazair you requested. 
 GIBBS: The translator was Sa'id? 
 GAMAL: That's right. Apparently there's a problem? 
 GIBBS: Did you know him? 
 GAMAL: Only to say hello. He worked with the interrogator Paula Cassidy. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. TRACT HOME - DAY 
 GAMAL: You might want to think about keeping that door shut. Iguanas have been known to wander inside. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 GIBBS: Nasir arrived in June from Afghanistan. 
 GAMAL: Yes. Insists he was picked up by mistake. 
 TONY: Ha. Weren't they all? 
 GAMAL: Agent Cassidy did especially well with the subject. Younger detainees feel more comfortable with female interrogators. Once rapport has been established, the prisoner is only interrogated by that team. I understand Agent Cassidy is not in the loop on this? 
 GIBBS: Correct. 
 GAMAL: I'll put you in an interrogation room for this afternoon. 
 GIBBS: Well, we better get started. 
 (GAMAL WALKS O.S.) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 GIBBS: Okay, I want to know more about Agent Cassidy. Who her friends are in Gitmo. How she spends her free time. Where she hangs out. Was she involved with Sa'id. 
 TONY AND KATE: Sure. No problem. 
 GIBBS: Did I say both of you? 
 KATE: Well, you didn't not say both of us, Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: Yes, she's kind of got a point there, boss. 
 KATE: Yeah, well I'm saying it now. DiNozzo, you go. Kate stay here and help me with this. 
 TONY: Got it. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 KATE: Do you mind telling me why he-- 
 GIBBS: Yeah. 
 (PASSAGE OF TIME) 
 TONY: Agent Cassidy has a lot of friends, I'll say that. Mostly male friends and mostly either interrogators or translators. 
 GIBBS: Where's she hang? 
 TONY: A club on Base called El Foridita. 
 GIBBS: Check it out. Observe her if she's there. 
 TONY: Can I drink? 
 GIBBS: Sure. Sarsaparilla. 
 TONY: Sarsaparilla? Who drinks sarsaparilla? 
 GIBBS: Shane. 
 TONY: Who's Shane. 
 KATE: Alan Ladd. 
 TONY: Who's Alan Ladd? 
 GIBBS: Maybe you should check her out, Kate.

 BARTENDER: Have you ever seen the "Maltese Falcon"? 
 TONY: Nope. 
 BARTENDER: You young people don't know what good movies are. All this violence, today. It's so sad. 
 TONY: Splat isn't violent? 
 CASSIDY: What're you drinking? 
 TONY: Sarsaparilla. 
 BARTENDER: Root beer. 
 CASSIDY: So you're on duty? 
 TONY: Maybe I just like sarsaparilla. 
 CASSIDY: Cosmo, Jimmy. 
 BARTENDER: Coming up. 
 TONY: It's funny. I knew you were going to order a Cosmo. 
 CASSIDY: Are you here to check me out? 
 TONY: Define "checking out." 
 CASSIDY: Come on. What are you doing here? 
 TONY: Straight up? 
 CASSIDY: No. I want you to lie to me.

 TONY: Absolutely. If you don't like me, then why did you come over here for refills? 
 CASSIDY: Jimmy? (TO TONY) I like the game. 
 TONY: Me, too. 
 CASSIDY: Your move. 
 TONY: You've been here eight months and you haven't hooked up. 
 CASSIDY: How do you know? 
 TONY: You've danced with five different guys. Nothing going on with any of them. 
 CASSIDY: You're counting the men that I'm dancing with? 
 TONY: I'm the jealous type. 
 CASSIDY: Oh. Jimmy, does he look like the jealous type? 
 JIMMY: I thought so. 
 TONY: See? 
 JIMMY: He flashed his badge when I wouldn't answer any questions about you. 
 TONY: More info than she needed, Jimmy. 
 CASSIDY: Oh, I'm disappointed. 
 TONY: What if I told you I was checking out the competition? 
 CASSIDY: I'd say you were lying. 
 TONY: No, it's true. I am checking out the competition. 
 CASSIDY: For your investigation. 
 TONY: And for me. 
 CASSIDY: So what are you going to write in your report? 
 TONY: That you have rules about hooking up with men you work with. Accurate? 
 CASSIDY: Incomplete. I have rules about guys that investigate me, too. 
 TONY: Never broken a rule? 
 CASSIDY: Have you? 
 TONY: If the risk is worth it. Jimmy, un tequila y una cerveza, por favor. 
 JIMMY: Si, senor. 
 TONY: Let's dance.

 GIBBS: Tell him he's not going back to his cell. He's being transferred to isolation.

 FADE IN: 
 INT. LIVING ROOM 
 GIBBS: Why did you recommend transferring Nasir to minimum security? 
 CASSIDY: Reward for cooperation. That's the idea around here. 
 GIBBS: We've read the transcripts. He didn't tell us anything we didn't know. 
 CASSIDY: Well, that's not the point. He told us all that he knows. 
 GIBBS: Are you sure? 
 CASSIDY: It's a judgment call. But we get a lot of flak around here for holding people too long. Are you going to tell me what's going on? 
 GIBBS: Are you going to tell us what was going on between you and Sa'id? 
 CASSIDY: We worked together. That's all. 
 GIBBS: These were found in Sa'id's luggage. 
 CASSIDY: Well he was going to put them in the mail for me. 
 GIBBS: You couldn't find the post office? 
 CASSIDY: Mail is slow out of Gitmo. Sa'id was on his way to the States and I asked him to throw them in the mail for me. 
 GIBBS: Do you mind if we open them? 
 CASSIDY: Yes, I mind. They're private. 
 GIBBS: We'll get a court order. 
 CASSIDY: What the hell is this about? Why do you have these letters? Something happened to Sa'id? 
 GIBBS: He's dead. 
 CASSIDY: Oh, my god. How? What happened? (BEAT) Tell me how he died! 
 GIBBS: Internal bleeding from a perforated bowel caused by the presence of hard objects in his intestines. 
 CASSIDY: Hard objects? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Look, I have been a damn good NCIS Agent for over six years now. I really don't deserve to be treated like this. 
 GIBBS: All we asked is can we open these letters. 
 CASSIDY: Sure. Go head. Open the damn things. 
 GIBBS: Thank you. 
 CASSIDY: They're to my family. Would you like to search my apartment while you're at it?

 KATE: Violated beyond belief. You know why you're attracted to her, don't you? 
 TONY: Who said I was? 
 KATE: It's endorphins. 
 TONY: Thank you, Abby. 
 KATE: Oh, you were so excited about going to Cuba and riding in the jet. It stimulated the hell out of your endorphins. The first woman you saw was like honey to a bear. 
 TONY: You were the first woman I saw on my endorphin high. 
 KATE: Yeah, well we work together, Tony. It's like a brother sister thing. 
 TONY: I never had a sister. 
 KATE: That's probably a good thing. 
 TONY: You just passed Sa'id's room, sis.

 TONY: Well she doesn't have a key to his. 
 KATE: Women like making love in their own bed. 
 TONY: (LAUGHS) Now, wait a minute. Just because you're woman and you enjoy doing it.... 
 KATE: You're right. I misspoke.

 CASSIDY: Gladly. Just treat me as a member of the team. 
 GIBBS: We're in the same agency, not on the same team.

 GIBBS: Yeah. Yeah, almost. Uh... why is Special Agent DiNozzo sorry?

 DUCKY: I don't see Channel Number Five. 
 ABBY: Does anyone wear that anymore? 
 DUCKY: My mother does. 
 ABBY: Really? 
 DUCKY: Ever since Marilyn Monroe confessed that Channel Number Five was all she wore to bed. 
 ABBY: So... does your mother...? 
 DUCKY: Unfortunately yes. Makes for terribly awkward slumber parties. 
 GAMAL: (V.O.) Nasir is extremely upset. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 
 GAMAL: He feels he's been cooperative and now he's in a cell with no windows. 
 GIBBS: Well maybe after losing all this luxury will make him more cooperative. 
 GAMAL: Well, a psychiatrist examined him and is worried for his mental health. 
 GIBBS: I'm not all that interested in the mental health of people who want to kill me. 
 GAMAL: You're certain Nasir is a terrorist? Isn't it possible he is what he says he is, a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time? 
 GIBBS: Yes. It's also possible that he's the man who gave Sa'id those emeralds. 
 GAMAL: Why would he do that? 
 GIBBS: Are you that naive or did Nasir pass some of those emeralds on to you?

 ABBY: Perfume is the most powerful accessory a woman can wear.

 GIBBS: Yeah, well how much has all this power cost us? 
 ABBY: (FILTERED/ON MONITOR) Around fifteen hundred. 
 GIBBS: Fifteen hundred dollars?!

 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) Do you want to hear about his hard drive? 
 GIBBS: What's it going to cost me? 
 ABBY: (ON MONITOR/FILTERED) It's pretty much synonymous with his s*x drive. (V.O./FILTERED) Our boy deleted twenty gigs of p0rn before he turned his drive in. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: He was trading with a p0rn pal on a Hot Mail account... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (FILTERED/ON MONITOR) ...that doesn't exist anymore. 
 GIBBS: Anything good on it? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: Nothing with sawdust, yet. 
 (END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
 GIBBS: Agent Cassidy's? 
 TONY: Yeah. Uh... and nothing else of interest in her apartment, except... 
 GIBBS: What? 
 TONY: She had a bottle of Escada on her dresser. And Sa'id had a key to her apartment, but she did not have a key to his. 
 GIBBS: Most women prefer their own beds. So she and Sa'id were doing a horizontal salsa. 
 TONY: Not according to the bartender at El Floridito. 
 GIBBS: What? Lovers register with him at Gitmo first? 
 TONY: Bartenders know this kind of stuff, boss. He said she went there most nights, danced with a lot of guys, but always went home alone. 
 GIBBS: What'd you find out, Kate? 
 KATE: Sa'id's place wasn't just clean. It was sterilized. There was some towels, soap and a half a roll of toilet paper. 
 TONY: I think Sa'id copied Paula's key without her knowing it. 
 GIBBS: Now which brain is thinking that, DiNozzo? 
 TONY: I'm hitting the rack. 
 (DOOR CLOSES O.S.) 
 GIBBS: Get this off to Abby first thing in the morning. 
 KATE: You know, Gibbs, sometimes you can be a real... 
 GIBBS: b*st*rd? 
 KATE: Yes. 
 GIBBS: Yeah, well my gut is telling me Agent Cassidy is telling the truth. 
 KATE: So then what's the problem? 
 GIBBS: Romance between agents, Kate... it never works. 
 KATE: Are you speaking from experience? 
 CASSIDY: (V.O.) Sa'id and I were not lovers. 
 
 
 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CLUB PATIO - DAY 
 CASSIDY: Who told you that? 
 GIBBS: A room key. Had yours on his key chain. 
 CASSIDY: That's not possible. How would he get my room key? 
 GIBBS: You gave it to him. 
 CASSIDY: No I didn't! I lost a key. Had to replace one. Sa'id could have stolen it. 
 GIBBS: Are you just remembering now that you lost a key? 
 CASSIDY: I was just told that somebody else had it. 
 GIBBS: Okay. Okay, let's say that I buy that. Why would he want a key to your room? 
 CASSIDY: To get to my computer. But how does he get my password? 
 GIBBS: If you don't keep your doors shut, the iquanas get in. 
 CASSIDY: We did so many interrogations together, he could have watched me type it in. 
 GIBBS: Why would Sa'id want to get into your computer? 
 CASSIDY: To read my interrogation reports. I don't know. Lately I noticed that his conversations with Nasir seemed longer than his translations. I even noted that in my computer. Sa'id took leave and left the next day for the States... right after I wrote that. 
 GIBBS: His room was empty. He wasn't intending to come back. 
 CASSIDY: I should have had Ben come in and sit in on one of the interrogations and check my suspicions. I blew it. 
 GIBBS: These are the hard objects that Sa'id had in his stomach when he died. 
 CASSIDY: Emeralds? 
 GIBBS: Yeah. I think he got them from Nasir. 
 CASSIDY: How did Nasir get them past our body search? (BEAT) Nasir complained of constipation when he arrived and they gave him a laxative. 
 GIBBS: He got them in the same way Sa'id got them out.` 
 DUCKY: (V.O.) What are you looking at, Abby? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB 
 ABBY: It's just s*x, Ducky.(MUSIC B.G.) 
 DUCKY: Just s*x? 
 ABBY: Yeah. You know, the biological act between creatures within a species in response to neurological and physiological stimuli. 
 DUCKY: Between creatures within a species? 
 ABBY: Usually. 
 DUCKY: This isn't yours, I hope. 
 ABBY: No! It's off Sa'id's hard drive. Something's wrong. The files are too big. 
 DUCKY: (GIGGLES) Not just the files. 
 ABBY: Easter eggs. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. LIVING ROOM 
 GIBBS: What the hell are Easter eggs?(BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 ABBY: (ON MONITOR/FILTERED) Easter eggs are hidden messages within a computer program. If you don't know where to look, you don't know they're there. 
 GIBBS: They were hidden in the p0rn? 
 ABBY: (ON MONITOR/FILTERED) My cursor has moved across places that would make Tony blush. 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) What kind of messages? 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) There's a... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: ...diagram of the camp and a bunch of stuff in Arabic. It's coming to you now. Something tells me it's not a greeting from the bunny. 
 (END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 (PASSAGE OF TIME) 
 GAMAL: Sa'id arrived Gitmo April twenty third. April twenty eighth he writes "son-in-law located." May eleventh "son-in-law moved to minimum security." May twenty third he gets a response. "Leader disavows son in law. He will be eliminated by the one who is victorious." 
 TONY: Leader? 
 GIBBS: Bin Laden. 
 KATE: My god. We've got one of Bin Laden's son in laws here and didn't know it. 
 GIBBS: The one who is victorious? Why does he start talking in riddles all of a sudden? 
 GAMAL: I don't think he is. I may not be translating that accurately. 
 (SFX: COMPUTER BEEP TONES B.G.) 
 GAMAL: Nasir is old Arabic for "the one who is victorious." I owe you an apology, Gibbs. If I'd transferred Nasir into minimum security... 
 GIBBS: You didn't. Don't worry about it. 
 TONY: How do we find this son-in-law? 
 GIBBS: Easy. We transfer Nasir to minimum security so he can kill him. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 FADE IN: 
 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
 MC CLARFFERTY: At Camp Delta the security buck stops with me. If Nasir kills a detainee, it'll be my ass. 
 GIBBS: Yeah. But once the son-in-law learns that Bin Laden ordered him murdered, he's going to sing like a bird in Islamic paradise and maybe that prevents another Nine Eleven. 
 MC CLARFFERTY: What's your plan, Gibbs? 
 GIBBS: We transfer Nasir to minimum security. 
 GAMAL: From isolation to minimum security? He's bound to be suspicious. 
 TONY: A new interrogator will have to deliver the news convincingly. 
 KATE: Since we know he trusts women, that's me. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 CASSIDY: No, that's me. I'm the one he trusts. 
 GIBBS: You promised him minimum security. He got isolation. He won't believe you have the authority to move him. 
 CASSIDY: He will when I order the guards to remove the shackles. 
 TONY: That's too risky. 
 KATE: Tony's right. 
 CASSIDY: Nasir and Sa'id did this right in front of me. 
 KATE: You're an interrogator, not a translator. You couldn't have known. 
 CASSIDY: But I did. I had suspicions about Sa'id and I let them slide. It's inexcusable. 
 GIBBS: Yep. 
 CASSIDY: Let me make up for it. 
 GIBBS: How good an actress are you, Agent Cassidy? 
 CASSIDY: Ask Tony. He bought my act. 
 TONY: Icing me was an act? 
 CASSIDY: No. Letting you think I was melting was.

 (MUSIC OVER ACTION/CART DRIVES THROUGH THE COMPOUND) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OBSERVATION ROOM 
 KATE: Tony, she'd say anything to get in that room.

 GIBBS: Yeah? Who won? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 CASSIDY: Hello, Nasir. 
 NASIR: I did not expect we'd meet again. 
 CASSIDY: Neither did I. (TO THE GUARD) Remove the shackles. (BEAT) Now please. 
 NASIR: Where is Gibbs? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OBSERVATION ROOM 
 CASSIDY: Recalled to Washington. His superiors determined that his concerns were unfounded. 
 GAMAL: (IN ARABIC) Agent Gibbs was recalled to Washington. It was determined by his superiors that his concerns were unfounded. 
 KATE: He's not buying it. 
 TONY: He will. 
 CASSIDY: Agent Gibbs has had... 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 
 CASSIDY: ...problems in the past. 
 GAMAL: Agent Cassidy, this is inappropriate. 
 CASSIDY: He deserves to know. He has a history of building cases at the expense of the facts. (TO GAMAL) Tell him. 
 GAMAL: (IN ARABIC) Gibbs has a history of building cases at the expense of the facts. 
 GIBBS: (OVERLAP) She's good. 
 NASIR: I was locked up like a dog. 
 CASSIDY: It was out of my hands, Nasir. I'm sorry. I've arranged to have you returned to your cell. Just answer one question. Do you have a conscience? 
 GAMAL: (IN ARABIC) Do you have a conscience? 
 NASIR: I have a moral awareness of my actions. 
 CASSIDY: Good. Because I've trusted you, Nasir. 
 NASIR: I am glad you are back. 
 CASSIDY: So am I. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OBSERVATION ROOM 
 KATE: She's ending the session. What is she doing? 
 TONY: Playing him. 
 CUT TO:

 GAMAL: He's asking about the transfer to minimum security you promised him. 
 CASSIDY: I'll try.

 MC CLARFFERTY: (V.O.) We have a hundred and twenty detainees in minimum... 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMAND VEHICLE - DAY 
 MC CLARFFERTY: ...security at present. Twenty to a unit. Barracks twenty is the one Nasir is assigned to. And this... that's the inside surveillance cam. 
 GIBBS: How many guards inside the barracks? 
 MC CLARFFERTY: Two. One at each exit. Front and rear. 
 TONY: Odds are six to one against his target being billeted in the same barracks as him. 
 GIBBS: That means Nasir is going to have to kill his target in the exercise yard. What does Secret Service think? 
 KATE: Three sharpshooters. There, there and one in the watch tower. I have an idea. 
 GIBBS: It's about time. 
 KATE: Nasir has to change his jumpsuit when he transfers, right? 
 GIBBS: Spankin' brand new white one. So? 
 KATE: So I want to add a little trim. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NASIR'S CELL - DAY 
 CASSIDY: You're being transferred to minimum security, Nasir. 
 NASIR: You have kept your word. 
 CASSIDY: Does that surprise you? 
 NASIR: No. 
 CASSIDY: Don't betray my trust, Nasir. 
 NASIR: I will not. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. COMMAND VEHICLE - DAY 
 MC CLARFFERTY: There. Right there. They're bringing him out now. 
 TONY: Talk about your own personal webcam. 
 MC CLARFFERTY: We only did enough of a search to keep it legitimate. 
 TONY: You think he already has a weapon? 
 GIBBS: Oh yeah, I do. Probably a shiv. 
 MC CLARFFERTY: That makes sense. Easy to conceal. 
 KATE: How does he make a shiv in max security? 
 MC CLARFFERTY: A comb, a toothbrush, something innocuous ground to a point.

 GIBBS: Oh, yeah.
