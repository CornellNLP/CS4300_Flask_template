 MUSIC IN: 
 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
 (SFX: PIANO B.G.) 
 JILL: We're running late. Let's get a move on, little lady. 
 SANDY: There's someone at the front door, Mom. 
 (DOOR BELL RINGS) 
 JILL: Show off. Let's go. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 POLICE OFFICER: Mrs. Watson? 
 JILL: Yes? 
 POLICE OFFICER: There's been an accident, Ma'am. Your husband... he's been injured. I'm to transport you and your daughter to the hospital. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OFFICE - DAY 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 WIFE: Good morning, Captain Watson. 
 WATSON: Good morning, Shirley. 
 SHIRLEY: How'd the recital go last night? 
 WATSON: Well, would it be wrong for me to say that I'm the father of the most talented little girl in the entire world? 
 SHIRLEY: It'd be wrong if you didn't. Still on a diet, or should I put cream in your coffee? 
 WATSON: I ran ten miles yesterday. 
 SHIRLEY: Cream coming right up. 
 (SHIRLEY WALKS O.S.) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 COMPUTER VOICE: (MORPHED) Captain Watson. 
 WATSON: Who's there? 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Before Shirley returns with your coffee... know that we have your wife and daughter. If you want to see them alive again, you will do exactly as I say. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 (THEME MUSIC UP OVER OPENING TITLE/SCENES/ CREDITS AND OUT) 
 MUSIC IN: 
 INT. OFFICE - DAY 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Look in your briefcase's back compartment. 
 WATSON: Who are you? 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Now, Captain Watson. Plug it in and place it on top of your computer screen. You will go about your day in the usual way. Only you will not leave your office. You will make no attempt to contact anyone. 
 WATSON: Who are you? What do you want!? 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Two million dollars from the Special Operations fund. 
 WATSON: Are you crazy? I can't transfer two million dollars. The system won't allow me to! 
 COMPUTER VOICE: You'll find a way, Captain. Or would you rather I shoot them both right now? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 "SEE NO EVIL" 
 TONY: Anyone? And I mean anyone know when the air conditioner's getting fixed? Huh? What about the name of the genius who invented windows that don't open? And what are we on? A space ship? Windows should open... 
 KATE: Have you been working out? 
 TONY: All summer long. Thanks for finally noticing. 
 KATE: No, I mean right now, because you're sweating like a pig and it's not very attractive. 
 (SFX: KATE SHRIEKS) 
 MCGEE: Uh... morning, Agent Todd. 
 KATE: McGee, 
 MCGEE: Yeah? 
 KATE: You have two seconds to tell me what you're doing down there. 
 MCGEE: I'm... I'm upgrading the computer network and uh... 
 KATE: Time's up. 
 MCGEE: No, I wasn't looking. I swear. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! I wasn't looking.... I wasn't looking... ow! 
 GIBBS: Tony. 
 TONY: Yes, Sir? 
 GIBBS: Did I just see what I thought I saw? 
 TONY: Out of respect for my co-workers, boss, I'd have to say... yes, you did. And it's very disturbing. 
 GIBBS: I agree. Put your damn shirt back on. This is a Federal office building, not a gym. Damn, McGee. Why are you still here? 
 MCGEE: Uh... the contractors - they won't wire the network until the air conditioning's fixed. It's a union thing so... 
 GIBBS: So you decided it's more important for an NCIS Special Agent to crawl around all day by yourself? 
 TONY: Man asked you a question. 
 MCGEE: I just wanted it fixed before I returned to Norfolk. 
 GIBBS: Yeah? You have any idea where thinking like this is gonna lead you? 
 TONY: Yeah, do you, McGee? 
 GIBBS: Promotion. You need any help, you ask Tony here. Looks like he can use the workout. 
 MCGEE: It's not that difficult. So I guess I could do it myself. 
 TONY: Good answer. 
 KATE: Don't let him intimidate you, McGee. That's my job today. (INTO PHONE) Agent Todd? 
 MCGEE: I didn't look. 
 TONY: Oh, no. I believe you. I just have a little question that I want to ask you. Is she a panty hose or a thong girl because I'm thinking thong. 
 (KATE PUNCHES TONY) 
 (TONY GRUNTS) 
 KATE: We've got a problem, Gibbs. 
 (GIBBS BANGS HIS PDA ON THE TABLE) 
 GIBBS: I hate this thing. Crap! 
 KATE: There's a secretary from the Pentagon downstairs and she claims that her boss is being held hostage by his computer. 
 GIBBS: See? There is a reason I didn't trust these things. Here. Reboot that or something. (TO KATE) Send her up. 
 MCGEE: Reboot it? 
 KATE: Or you can do what we always do. 
 TONY: It's his third one this month. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 
 SHIRLEY: When I brought him his coffee I heard the computer talking to him. 
 KATE: "You've got mail?" 
 SHIRLEY: No, it was this weird electronic voice, and then it cut off the second I entered the room. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but I can't tell you the rest until you promise that you won't try to contact him. 
 GIBBS: Whatever you're afraid of, Miss Wilkes, we can handle it. 
 SHIRLEY: He slipped this into a stack of folders and he told me to take the rest of the day off. 
 GIBBS: Forget your glasses, boss? 
 KATE: (READS) Office under electronic surveillance. Can't leave! Jill and Sandy kidnapped. Must transfer two mil to overseas account by eighteen hundred or they die. Contact NCIS. No one else. 
 TONY: Finally someone appreciates us. 
 SHIRLEY: If anything should happen to them... I mean, she's just a little girl, Agent Gibbs. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: The Watson's live in McLean. There's no answer at home and their daughter Sandy didn't show up to school this morning. It says here she's blind. 
 GIBBS: Tony? 
 TONY: I can confirm he's the comptroller for J-SOC. Office is in the A-ring of the Pentagon. I'm pulling up a schematic now. 
 KATE: J-SOC? 
 TONY: Joint Special Operations Command. They fund S.M.U. S.M.U. stands for... 
 KATE: Special Military Units. I worked with a few of them when I was Secret Service. So he can really transfer this kind of money overseas? 
 GIBBS: More if he needs to. 
 TONY: Our bad buy would have to pass through five security checkpoints to get to Watson's office. 
 KATE: Well, the Pentagon records all access. 
 GIBBS: There's twenty five thousand people working there, Kate. 
 TONY: By the time we're done downloading that list, the Government's out two million dollars. 
 GIBBS: Or Watson's family's dead. 
 KATE: Well, it has to be somebody on the inside. The Pentagon is the most secure building in the world. 
 MCGEE: They could be using a Trojan. She said that they were using his computer. A Trojan would give them back door access. 
 TONY: You kiss your mother with that mouth, McGee? 
 MCGEE: No, Tony. A Trojan is a program. It's like a virus that establishes a gateway into a computer and allows a hacker to control the system. 
 KATE: It still doesn't explain how it got into his machine. 
 MCGEE: Well, if they're good they could have done it from anywhere. They wouldn't even have to set foot in the building. 
 TONY: How are they watching him then? 
 MCGEE: Could be using a web cam. 
 GIBBS: Or they're lying. Kate, take McGee and search the Watson's house. DiNozzo, I want everything there is on Watson and his family by the time I get back. 
 TONY: Where are you going, boss? 
 GIBBS: To talk to Captain Watson. 
 KATE: Wait, Gibbs, if they're watching him and you show up... 
 GIBBS: I'd better make sure they don't notice me. 
 (GIBBS WALKS O.S.) 
 KATE: That is not a good call. 
 GIBBS: Relax. You think Gibbs keeps that haircut to save on shampoo? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. PENTAGON HALLWAY - DAY 
 SERGEANT: (V.O.) Morning, Gunny. 
 GIBBS: Good morning, Staff Sergeant. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WATSON'S OFFICE - DAY 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Moving those dollars around, Captain? 
 WATSON: I'm trying. The only way I can stay under the radar is to not make a withdrawal that exceeds ten thousand dollars from any single operational budget. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 COMPUTER VOICE: What's that? 
 WATSON: Oh, this is an office. People are going to be dropping by request forms all day long. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Not today. Send them away. 
 WATSON: If I keep doing that, they're going to get suspicious. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Okay, but just don't forget what's at stake here, Captain. 
 WATSON: I won't... you b*st*rd. Enter. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 GIBBS: Sorry to have missed the budget meeting yesterday, Sir. You know how the Colonel gets when he's sick. 
 WATSON: How's he doing, Gunny? 
 GIBBS: Better, Sir. Thank you. He wanted me to check with you, see if you needed any extra help down here. 
 WATSON: Tell him I appreciate it, but we've got things covered. 
 GIBBS: Roger that, Sir. The latest batch of requests for you. The most immediate priorities on top. This must be that daughter you're always talking about. She is a beauty, Sir. 
 WATSON: She is that, Gunny. She is that. 
 GIBBS: If you change your mind, Sir, all you have to do is call. We have plenty of people willing to help you, Sir. 
 WATSON: I will Gunny, thank you. 
 GIBBS: You have a nice day, Sir. 
 (DOOR OPENS/ CLOSES) 
 WATSON: He's gone. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: He was right about one thing. She is a little beauty. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. DARK ROOM - ON MONITOR 
 SANDY: Who... who's there? 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Shhhh. 
 (SFX: SANDY SHOUTS) 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 MUSIC IN: 
 INT. CAR - PARKED 
 MCGEE: Well no signs of anyone observing the place. 
 KATE: Let's roll. 
 (CAR DOOR OPENS/CLOSES) 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
 KATE: She either left in a hurry or was forced to. 
 MCGEE: What makes you think she didn't just leave it there? 
 KATE: Because she's a little girl, McGee. They're not typically slobs. 
 MCGEE: Remind me to introduce you to my little sister. 
 KATE: What was that?! 
 MCGEE: Nothing, Agent Todd. 
 (SFX: DOOR BELL RINGS) 
 KATE: Are you still pushing to be a full-time field agent? 
 MCGEE: Very much so. 
 KATE: Well, we need to get in. Suggestions? 
 MCGEE: Uh... last time I encountered a situation like this... Tony threw a rock through the window. 
 KATE: Yet another glaring difference between boys and girls. Follow me. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 COMPUTER VOICE: He was right about one thing. She is a little beauty. 
 ABBY: Okay, Gibbs. Your mike is coming in loud and clear. Who's in the office with him? The devil? 
 TONY: Hey. You know, considering that no one in this room is actually deaf, that is really annoying. 
 (GIBBS AND ABBY SIGN) 
 TONY: Hey, that was about me, wasn't it? 
 GIBBS: Patch in the video, Abs. 
 (SFX: KEYBOARDING) 
 ABBY: It's not a very flattering angle. 
 GIBBS: Well, it's the best I could do. What can you tell me about the voice? 
 ABBY: It sounds like this particle physicist I used to date. He had these tiny little Chiclet-like teeth and an Eiffel tower tat on his... 
 GIBBS: You want this, Abby, or not? 
 ABBY: Okay, obviously it's being disguised. I think I can filter it back to its original state. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: (FAST FORWARD) She is a little beauty. She is a little beauty. 
 TONY: Yeah, okay. I'll get that A.P.B. out on the Lollipop Guild right away. 
 ABBY: Patience, Tony. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: (SLOW MOTION) Little beauty. A little beauty. (UNFILTERED) He was right about one thing. She is a little beauty. 
 ABBY: Pretty cool, huh? 
 GIBBS: Not bad. 
 ABBY: Thank you. 
 GIBBS: Next thing I want you to do is hack into Watson's computer. It's the only link we have to the kidnapper. 
 ABBY: Gibbs, we are talking about the Pentagon here. Even their encryptions have encryptions. 
 GIBBS: Yeah? That dirt bag sure managed it. 
 ABBY: It probably took him months! Our best bet is to ask the D.O.D. for access to their system. 
 GIBBS: First thing they'll do is disconnect the connection. If that happens we'll end up with two dead dependents. 
 ABBY: I don't know if I can do it. 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo, get McGee on the hook. 
 ABBY: No! I'll get in. 
 GIBBS: Yeah. 
 ABBY: Yeah. 
 GIBBS: I believe you. 
 (GIBBS WALKS O.S.) 
 TONY: Relax. When's the last time Gibbs was wrong? Discounting the whole marriage thing, of course. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. WATSON'S HOUSE - DAY 
 KATE: Okay. McGee, hold me steady! 
 MCGEE: All right. 
 KATE: Okay, go left. No, my left. Your right! McGee, what are you doing? 
 MCGEE: I'm doing what you're telling me to do. 
 KATE: Are your eyes closed? 
 MCGEE: Yes! 
 KATE: Well then open them before you kill us! 
 MCGEE: But this morning you... 
 KATE: McGee, can't you tell when somebody's kidding with you? 
 MCGEE: I used to and then I met you guys. 
 KATE: Do you want to work with Gibbs? Then you're going to have to get over that. Trust me, I know. 
 MCGEE: Eyes open it is. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo, I need a way to communicate with Captain Watson. 
 TONY: Communication part's solved, boss. Earwig radio receiver. Used 'em all the time for undercover work back in Baltimore. 
 GIBBS: How do we get it in his ear? 
 TONY: Did I also mention there's one tiny flaw in my plan? 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo, I show back up there as a Gunny, our guy's going to get suspicious. 
 TONY: Well, you think I can pass for a Marine? 
 GIBBS: I don't know. Let's shave your head and find out. 
 TONY: Actually, I was leaning more towards Merchant Marine kind of thing. 
 GIBBS: I've got a better idea. Don't eat that. No, no! 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
 (SFX: KATE PLAYS PIANO KEYS) 
 MCGEE: Well, no signs of forced entry or a struggle. 
 KATE: They could have been taken at gunpoint. 
 MCGEE: Well, it's possible but I don't think so. 
 KATE: Why is that? 
 MCGEE: Well, why go to the trouble of locking the front door behind you? 
 KATE: Not bad, McGee. Tony hasn't completely ruined you yet. Their daughter must be quite the pianist. Beautiful, too. There's nothing here. We're wasting our time. Let's go. Uh uh. I use the door. You lock it and go back out the window. 
 MCGEE: I get it, you're kidding, right? 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY 
 (SFX: MCGEE SLIPS ON THE ROOF TILES AND SLIDES) 
 MCGEE: Whoa! 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WATSON'S OFFICE 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Five hours left, Captain. Ring the tote. 
 WATSON: I've managed to isolate nine hundred thousand. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: I'd move faster if I was you. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 COMPUTER VOICE: You're learning. You may answer. 
 WATSON: Enter! 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 TONY: Hey, Captain. You got your sweet and sour with extra pineapple. I figured you might want to change your order tomorrow. I hear we're getting in some fresh duck.(DOOR CLOSES) 
 WATSON: I'll just stick with the usual. 
 TONY: All right. Eight seventy five today. How's the family doing? 
 WATSON: Fine. You? 
 TONY: Still having trouble communicating with the girlfriend. I talk... she doesn't listen. What are you going to do? 
 (SFX: TONY GRUNTS) 
 WATSON: Oh, yeah. Sure. For you. 
 GIBBS: Thanks, Captain. See you tomorrow. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Freeze! Open your lunch. Show it to the camera. Now! (CHUCKLES) Enjoy.

 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
 TONY: Delivery complete. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. LAB - DAY 
 GIBBS: That's good work, Tony. 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) Thanks, Boss. That means a lot. 
 GIBBS: If NCIS doesn't work out, I hear General Lee's Chinese Restaurant is hiring. (TO ABBY) Abs, get the Captain up on the feed. 
 ABBY: All right. You're in. 
 GIBBS: This is Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS. If you can hear me cough once, Captain. 
 (SFX: WATSON COUGHS B.G.) 
 GIBBS: We are changing the game plan, Skipper. When he contacts you again, tell him you want a good faith gesture on his part. Tell him that you want your daughter returned now. Tell him if you don't get her back you're going to take your chances with the FBI. He'll try to intimidate you, we have to call his bluff. Rub your brow if you have the courage to go this route. You are not alone, Captain. We're going to get through this together. I will be in touch. Okay, I want these feeds hardwired into M-TAC. 
 (SFX: COMPUTER BEEP TONES) 
 ABBY: Done. 
 GIBBS: We inside his computer yet? 
 ABBY: Oh, um... I think I'm... 
 GIBBS: Need help? 
 ABBY: Yeah. 
 GIBBS: All you had to do was ask. One of the smartest people I know told me that once. 
 ABBY: Who? 
 GIBBS: You. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: The car is still in the driveway. No signs of a struggle inside. I think they may have known their kidnapper. 
 GIBBS: Or been duped. 
 KATE: Well, it looks like you and Tony have been making some progress. 
 GIBBS: Not enough. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Time to update, Captain. 
 WATSON: I'm doing my best. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Just make your deadline. 
 (HANGS UP PHONE) 
 GIBBS: McGee, help Abby get into Watson's computer. (TO TONY) Hey, come one. Let's go. 
 KATE: A little short on deodorant today, Tony? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WATSON'S OFFICE - DAY 
 WATSON: (ON TV) I've isolated nearly one point three million. (ON CAMERA) Now I want a gesture of good faith from you. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: What kind of gesture, Captain? 
 WATSON: I want you to release my daughter immediately. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Not going to happen. 
 WATSON: Why? Because they're already dead? How do I know that's not just a tape!? You listen to me. You let Sandy go right now or it's over. I'm going to the FBI. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: You'd never forgive yourself, you know. 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) This is the hard part, Captain. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. MTAC ROOM - DAY 
 GIBBS: Don't back down. Tell him you want to talk to your daughter. 
 WATSON: (V.O./FILTERED) I want to speak to her! 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WATSON'S OFFICE - DAY 
 WATSON: Right now! (HOODED MAN AND SANDY APPEAR ON MONITOR) 
 COMPUTER VOICE: (ON MONITOR) Plays the piano. Gifted, I hear. You don't need eyes to play the piano.... but you sure as hell need ears! 
 (SANDY SCREAMS) 
 WATSON: (SHOUTS) Sandy! 
 COMPUTER VOICE: (ON MONITOR) One little tap. Monaural. Then the other ear, pop! Total silence and darkness forever.(SANDY CRIES B.G.) 
 KATE: We can't risk that. 
 GIBBS: He's bluffing. Stand your ground. Tell him if he does, that he'll never see a penny. 
 KATE: Gibbs... 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WATSON'S OFFICE 
 WATSON: Let her go unharmed or I swear you'll never see a dime.

 KYLE GRAYSON: You know, I never was any good at taking orders, Captain. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. MTAC ROOM - DAY 
 WATSON: (ON MONITOR) I screwed up. I screwed it all up. 
 GIBBS: It's only been forty minutes, Captain. He will contact you soon. Until then you have to stay strong. It's our best chance of getting your family back. (TO KATE) You got something to say? 
 KATE: We're taking a really big risk here, Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: Yeah, Kate? What happens to the little girl and her mother once this dirt bag gets the money? 
 KATE: What, you think he'll kill them? 
 GIBBS: You're the profiler. You tell me. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WATSON'S OFFICE - DAY 
 (SFX: PHONE RINGS) 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Answer your phone, Captain. 
 WATSON: Where is she? Where's my daughter!

 SANDY: (V.O./FILTERED) Daddy?! 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. MTAC ROOM - DAY 
 WATSON: (ON MONITOR) Sandy! (V.O.) Sweetheart, where are you? 
 SANDY: (V.O.) I don't know. He let me go, but he said, he said he'll kill Mom if I tell anyone what happened! 
 WATSON: (ON MONITOR) Tell me where she is. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Lorton Amtrak station. You got your good faith gesture. Now get back to work. 
 GIBBS: My people are on the way, Captain. Tell her to stay where she is. (TO TONY AND KATE) Go get her. 
 WATSON: (ON MONITOR) Sandy, sweetheart, just stay right there. Don't... don't go anywhere. And Daddy... Daddy will be there to get you in just a little while.(SFX: SANDY CRIES B.G.)

 INT. WATSON'S OFFICE - DAY 
 COMPUTER VOICE: Hang up the phone now, Captain! And believe me when I say your wife's life depends on it. 
 WATSON: I have to hang up now, baby. And listen... I want you to be brave for me, okay? This will be over before you know it.

 ABBY: Face it, McGee. We are doomed. 
 MCGEE: Okay, we can try random password gener-- 
 ABBY: Did it. 
 MCGEE: How about an open port scan? 
 ABBY: Done it. 
 MCGEE: Oh, there's undocumented hole in the latest I.S.I-- 
 ABBY: Tried it. 
 MCGEE: Gibbs can't honestly expect us to hack into the Pentagon in a single afternoon? 
 ABBY: Yeah. 
 MCGEE: You're right. We are doomed. 
 ABBY: We have to call D.O.D. and hope they'll let us in without severing the connection. 
 MCGEE: Unless... what if the Trojan isn't system wide? If it was, our bad guy...: 
 ABBY: Could just steal the money himself. He wouldn't need... 
 MCGEE: Watson to do it for him. That means that he can't access the rest of the network. 
 ABBY: We've been trying to hack the wrong place! 
 MCGEE: Yeah. 
 (SFX: KEYBOARDING) 
 MCGEE: All right, scan for an open U-D-P and T-C-P connections on the J-SOC V-P-N. Yes! Yes! Got multiple incoming packets. Ports one-three-nine, four-four-five. Looks like a variant of the doomsday Trojan. 
 (SFX: COMPUTER BEEP TONE) 
 ABBY: I love it when you talk geek. 
 MCGEE: I love it that you love it. 
 GIBBS: I'll be sure to mention that to Captain Watson right after we're done burying his family. 
 ABBY: I would hold off on those funeral arrangements, Gibbs. The reason we're so excited... 
 GIBBS: We just hacked Captain Watson's computer. 
 ABBY: And we should be able to back trace the connection... 
 (SFX: SPARKS B.G.) 
 ABBY: No! No! No! No! No! Ah!(SFX: RAPID COMPUTER BEEP TONES) 
 ABBY: My baby just french fried. 
 MCGEE: The system's overheated. 
 GIBBS: So? Reboot it. 
 ABBY: Believe it or not, Gibbs, not all computer problems can be solved by rebooting. 
 GIBBS: Works for me. 
 ABBY: Even if it does, it's going to take at least an hour for mine to cool down. 
 MCGEE: And without air conditioning, it'll happen again. 
 GIBBS: So take it someplace cooler. 
 ABBY: Where? This whole building is like an illegal sweatshop. 
 GIBBS: Not the whole building, Abs.

 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: May I trouble you for the left ear, Mister Palmer? 
 PALMER: Ah, one left ear coming right up. 
 DUCKY: When is the DNA analysis coming back on the right toe grouping? 
 PALMER: Oh, should be ten - twelve days. 
 DUCKY: Well, that's interesting. 
 PALMER: What's that, Doctor? 
 DUCKY: Oh, dear. 
 PALMER: It's not the life ear? 
 DUCKY: It's the left! It's just not the right left. So to speak. 
 PALMER: Well that would mean that uh... 
 DUCKY: Three bodies. Time to start another table. 
 (SFX: DOORS SLIDE OPEN) 
 ABBY: Hey, Ducky. My computer died. We need some place cooler to set up shop. 
 DUCKY: Well, we're a bit tight on space at the moment, but you could use one oh seven. 
 (SFX: DRAWER SLIDES OPEN) 
 (SFX: MCGEE GASPS) 
 DUCKY: Definitely not one oh seven. 
 (SFX: DRAWER SLIDES SHUT) 
 (SFX: DRAWER SLIDES OPEN) 
 DUCKY: His family was supposed to make arrangements to pick him up last week. Ah, there we are. How's that? 
 ABBY: Perfect. Thank you. 
 DUCKY: Fascinating, isn't it? Parts of three separate bodies carved up with almost surgical precision. 
 MCGEE: Why? 
 DUCKY: I haven't a clue. Now we found them in a fifty five gallon drum of alcohol behind Bethesda Naval Hospital last month. 
 ABBY: McGee. 
 MCGEE: Yeah? 
 ABBY: We're kind of running short on time. 
 PALMER: Oh, can I give you a hand? 
 GIBBS: No, I'm all right.

 EXT. AMTRAK STATION - DAY 
 KATE: When I'm a mother, I'm never letting my kids out of my sight. 
 TONY: Yeah, how do you plan on doing that? 
 KATE: G-P-S locater strapped to the ankle. Audio and video surveillance built into their clothes. 
 TONY: No, I mean the part about becoming a mother. 
 KATE: Funny. The area looks clear to me. 
 TONY: Me, too. Let's go get that kid. 
 (SFX: SANDY CRIES B.G.) 
 KATE: Sandy? My name's Kate. 
 TONY: And I'm Tony. We're NCIS agents. That stands for... 
 SANDY: I know what it stands for. They spoke at my school. 
 KATE: Well, then you know that we're here to help you. Your daddy sent us. 
 TONY: We know what happened to you and your mom, but you're safe now. Okay? 
 SANDY: I heard him. 
 KATE: Heard who, honey? 
 SANDY: He didn't know it, but I heard him. He told my mom... he... he ... he's going to make my dad suffer. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 MCGEE: What the hell is it? 
 ABBY: It's probably just some leftover bodily fluid. 
 MCGEE: Oh, is that all. 
 ABBY: Yeah. 
 MCGEE: Disgusting. 
 DUCKY: If you want to be a fulltime field agent, Timothy, you're going to have to get used to sights like that. 
 MCGEE: Is it a common occurrence, Ducky, dismembered bodies in barrels of alcohol? 
 DUCKY: Well, now that you mention it, I did have a great uncle who drowned in a vat of alcohol. 
 MCGEE: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 DUCKY: Of course he reportedly climbed out three times to go to the bathroom. 
 GIBBS: Hey, what's the hold up? 
 ABBY: We are almost set here. 
 GIBBS: McGee, if I were you... I would spend more time working and less time cleaning. 
 MCGEE: Yes. Yes, Sir. Sorry, boss. 
 GIBBS: Duck, I got a patient upstairs for you. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: There you go. Feel better now? 
 SANDY: Yes. Thank you. 
 DUCKY: You've been a very brave patient, so I think you deserve a surprise. 
 SANDY: A Hershey bar? 
 DUCKY: Yes. Are you sure you're blind? 
 SANDY: I can smell it. 
 DUCKY: Oh, I'll be right back then. I need a few moments to talk to my friends. 
 (CAMERA ANGLE ON GIBB'S DESK) 
 TONY: It took him forty five minutes to drop her off. You figure twenty two minutes out, same back. That leaves a fifteen mile radius where he could be located. 
 KATE: Hundreds of square miles and what? We have two hours left. 
 TONY: We also pulled tapes from the train station. We might catch a shot of him dropping the kid off. 
 KATE: Gibbs, it's like a hundred degrees in here. How can you drink that stuff? 
 GIBBS: It keeps me cool. How's she doing, Duck? 
 DUCKY: Remarkably well, considering the circumstances. 
 GIBBS: What does she remember? 
 DUCKY: Unfortunately everything. 
 TONY: Except for where she was. 
 DUCKY: Maybe you haven't asked the right questions. 
 TONY: Well, she's eight and blind, Ducky. I mean, it's not a great help in a situation like... 
 DUCKY: Sandy, are you thirsty? 
 WATSON: A little bit. Can I have some water?

 ABBY: It's commercial grade, so consider it cracked... right... now! 
 MCGEE: Yes, team McGee does it again. 
 ABBY: Why team McGee? 
 MCGEE: No offense, I am the Special Agent. He must have switched off the audio. 
 ABBY: Team Abby. I'm the smart one.

 GIBBS: Sandy, this is really important. Can you tell us anything about the car you were driven in? 
 SANDY: Well, it was a man and there were no windows in back. 
 KATE: How could you tell? 
 SANDY: Because I couldn't feel the sun on my face. 
 GIBBS: What about the place he was keeping you and your mom? Anything unusual about it? 
 SANDY: (CRIES) I don't know. I was real scared. But I could hear him talking to my mom and she was crying and... and he kept on pulling my hair. 
 (SFX: PHONE RINGS B.G.) 
 KATE: It's okay, Sandy. Just tell us what you remember. 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, Gibbs. All right. We're on our way. (TO SANDY) Sandy, I want you to stay here with Doctor Mallard. We have to check-- 
 SANDY: I heard! You can see my mom on your computer now. I hear lots of things other kids can't. Can I help you?

 CUT TO: 
 INT. MTAC ROOM - DAY 
 COMPUTER VOICE: You want me to keep an arm or a leg? 
 GIBBS: Captain, we need more time. You have to stall him. 
 WATSON: (ON MONITOR) It's getting harder to find open accounts. You're going to have to give me more time. 
 COMPUTER VOICE: You have ninety minutes. Make it, your wife lives. If you don't, she dies. It's your call, Captain. 
 GIBBS: Negotiate, Captain. Tell him you need at least three more hours. I repeat, tell him you need another three hours. 
 WATSON: (ON MONITOR) I'll meet your deadline. 
 GIBBS: Oh, damn! 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 TONY: Good news, boss! I found a shot of our bad guy's vehicle on the train station tapes. The little girl was right. It's a white van with no windows. 
 GIBBS: Did you run the plates? 
 TONY: They came back stolen. 
 GIBBS: And this helps me because, DiNozzo? 
 TONY: I also I.D.ed our dirt bag. I pulled his prints from Sandy's hair thingies. 
 GIBBS: Berets. 
 TONY: Right. He's a former Petty Officer. Name's Kyle Grayson. Did six years in Leavenworth for embezzling government funds. And Captain Watson was responsible for putting him there. 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) Good job. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: We're going to play some sounds from the room that you were in, Sandy. I think it might help you remember better. 
 SANDY: Can you just play certain Hertz if I want you to? 
 ABBY: Sure, how did you know that? 
 SANDY: From the piano. I know the number of vibrations of every key. Like key number forty-four, E-four, that's three hundred and twenty nine point six-three Hertz. A-five is eight hundred and eighty. My mom says I'm half bat. 
 ABBY: Well, that's cool. I love bats. 
 SANDY: Me, too. I like your voice, Abby. It's kind of gravelly. 
 ABBY: Thank you. All right, are you ready to show off for us? 
 (SFX: KEYBOARDING) 
 KYLE GRAYSON: (ON TAPE) Lorton Amtrak Station. You've got your good faith gesture. Now get back to work. 
 SANDY: There are birds up kind of high. Try a G-seven. The eighty-third key. That's three thousand one hundred and thirty six Hertz. 
 KATE: That is amazing, Sandy. I'll be right back. (TO GIBBS) Gibbs, she's incredible. You've got to see her. 
 GIBBS: I want her listening to the live feed. 
 KATE: Gibbs, she's been traumatized enough. 
 GIBBS: Yeah? How about growing up without a mother, Kate? (TO SANDY) Hey, Sandy. I need you to... 
 SANDY: Listen to the live feed? I want to help my mommy, Agent Gibbs. I can take it. 
 GIBBS: Here. 
 SANDY: What's this? 
 GIBBS: Your very own NCIS badge. You ready? 
 SANDY: Yes. 
 GIBBS: McGee, bring the live feed up on the speakers. (TO SANDY) Sandy, we need to know anything you can tell us about where he is keeping your mom. 
 KYLE GRAYSON: (ON TAPE) When I took this job, I was instructed not to hurt you or the little princess, but your husband cost me six years! 
 JILL: (ON TAPE) Who hired you? 
 KYLE GRAYSON: (ON TAPE) I don't really care. The point is I've decided your husband has to pay for that. 
 JILL: (ON TAPE/CRYING) Why? 
 KYLE GRAYSON: (ON TAPE) No more questions.(SFX: SLAP/ CRYING) 
 SANDY: Go to the area of A-seven. I mean four thousand Hertz. Bring it two keys down. I mean three thousand eight hundred. 
 TONY: Sounds like a train. 
 SANDY: It's getting closer. It's passing right... now. 
 GIBBS: Seventeen-oh-six. What time's the next train scheduled to arrive in Lorton? 
 TONY: I'm on it, boss. 
 GIBBS: Can you remember anything else about the train sounds? 
 SANDY: We drove over a lot of tracks. My mom...she... she squeezed my hand every time. 
 GIBBS: How many times? 
 KYLE GRAYSON: (ON TAPE) Look at me! 
 SANDY: I don't know. A lot. (CRYING) What is he doing to her!? Why is she crying!? 
 GIBBS: You did great. 
 SANDY: Are you going to save my mom now? 
 GIBBS: Oh, yeah. You can count on that. Let's roll. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 TONY: Hey, the only train in the area is an Amtrak. It left D.C. at sixteen twenty, arrived Lorton seventeen thirty, average speed of sixty five miles an hour. Now, we know it passed our dirt bag at seventeen oh-six, right? So... damn it! I owe Mrs. Powers an apology. 
 MCGEE: Who? 
 TONY: My tenth grade math teacher. I told her I'd never be able to use anything she taught us in real life. 
 MCGEE: It's here. Seven miles outside of Lorton. 
 TONY: There's an abandoned train maintenance yard about a half mile north-- 
 GIBBS: That's the place. McGee, you tell Watson to delay sending the money.
