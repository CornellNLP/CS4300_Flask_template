 EXT. LOADING DOCK - DAY 
 (JEB LAUGHS B.G.) 
 HOBIE: I cannot believe they lost. 
 JEB: I can't believe you gave me six points. So what have you got for me today? 
 HOBIE: Just these drums here. 
 JEB: All righty, sweet cheeks. 
 (MUSIC OVER ACTION/HOBIE LOADS THE DRUMS ONTO THE TRUCK) 
 JEB: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (MUSIC OVER ACTION/DRUM FALLS FROM THE TRUCK) 
 (JEB COUGHS B.G.) 
 HOBIE: Oh, man. I'm going to be cleaning up this mess for days! 
 JEB: What the hell is that?

 FADE IN: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 "SUB ROSA" 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) No, the best thing is for you to do nothing. Okay, Agent McGee? Just secure the area and wait for us to get there. Okay. (TO KATE) Case Agent at Norfolk sounds pretty green. You look like hell. 
 KATE: A woman loves to hear that, Tony. 
 TONY: If you're coming down with something, don't sit next to me in the truck. 
 KATE: Oh, there's an upside to having a cold. 
 TONY: You want to tell the doctor about it? 
 GIBBS: Are you guys ready to go? 
 KATE: Uh... all set. Uh, yeah. And Ducky and Jackson are already on their way. 
 (SFX: COFFEE SPILLS) 
 KATE: Oh, God! Oh, god, I'm sorry. Uh... what do you put in your coffee? 
 GIBBS: Coffee. 
 KATE: Okay, I'll just go down the hall and get you another cup. 
 GIBBS: That's not coffee. I'll meet you in the truck. 
 (GIBBS WALKS O.S.) 
 TONY: I've never experienced Gibbs without his morning coffee. We're in uncharted waters here, Kate. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. DOCK - DAY 
 DUCKY: Yeah, there are multiple purposes for hydrofluoric acid on a Naval Base. It's most commonly used to surface clean metal. It's highly corrosive, readily penetrates human skin, destroying soft tissue and decalcifying bone. And from the look of this fellow, I'd say he wasn't in that drum very long. I'd venture less than twenty four hours. 
 TONY: Worst case of acid indigestion I've ever seen. 
 GIBBS: Hey. Better get Michael Jackson out of here before he ralphs. 
 TONY: Come on, McGee. Help me take measurements for the sketches. 
 GIBBS: Was he wearing Cracker Jacks, Duck? 
 DUCKY: Yeah. Definitely enlisted. We're not going to get fingerprints, but on the left forearm - a bit of skin attached and some discoloration. 
 KATE: A birthmark? 
 DUCKY: Possibly. I'll be able to tell more when I get him home. 
 KATE: The Armed Forces DNA registry can get us a match. 
 GIBBS: They're backlogged. I wouldn't count on anything for at least forty eight hours. 
 (GIBBS WALKS TO MCGEE AND PICKS UP HIS BRIEFCASE/ WALKS O.S.) 
 MCGEE: I've heard stories about Special Agent Gibbs. 
 TONY: Only half of them are true. The trick is figuring out which half. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. MAIN GATE - DAY 
 GIBBS: With inspection procedures as tight as they are, he was probably murdered on base.(PROTESTERS B.G.) 
 PEREZ: They didn't get him past us in the trunk of a car. 
 GIBBS: That means he had to be murdered by someone with clearance. 
 PEREZ: Yes, Sir. 
 GIBBS: Anyone reported missing? 
 PEREZ: We had a U.A. Seaman last week, but he was picked up at his home. 
 GIBBS: Whale huggers? 
 PEREZ: Yes, sir. They've been bugging us for weeks. 
 GIBBS: Why don't you just shoot them? 
 PEREZ: I've been tempted. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT 
 GIBBS: We have to keep the crime scene under guard until it's released by Gibbs. 
 MCGEE: I'll let security know. 
 TONY: Gibbs wants NCIS to remain in control. 
 MCGEE: So I should stay here? 
 TONY: We'll get you relieved as soon as we can. 
 MCGEE: Okay.(DOOR OPENS/ CLOSES) 
 KATE: Why are you making him stay here? 
 TONY: Because I can. 
 KATE: That is a complete abuse of authority. 
 TONY: Lighten up. He's new. He expects to be abused. It goes with the territory. 
 KATE: This isn't pledge week at Sigma Chi, Tony. 
 TONY: I'll bet you were a lot of fun in college. 
 KATE: I was a lot of fun in college. 
 TONY: Really?

 INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY 
 DUCKY: Fortunately, your facial bone structure is intact. With these photos, Abby will be able to build a computer model. Not a model you'd want on your mantle piece, but she'll do the best she can. 
 (DOORS OPEN) 
 JACKSON: Abby is getting Gibbs on the line. 
 DUCKY: Ah. Would you? 
 JACKSON: Sure.

 INT. MCGEE'S OFFICE - DAY 
 ABBY: (ON MONITOR) Good morning, guys.(BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Where's Ducky? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: (INTO PHONE) Right here, Jethro. 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED) Have you got a name? 
 DUCKY: (INTO PHONE) Ah, we're good but we're not that good. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Well, what do you got that's good, Duck. 
 DUCKY: (FILTERED/ON MONITOR) Ah, death was from blunt force injury. (V.O.) There's a fracture to the rear of the skull. 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) That's it? 
 DUCKY: (V.O./FILTERED) No. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: (INTO PHONE) You remember that discoloration on the forearm we thought might be a... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: (ON MONITOR)...birthmark? Well, it wasn't. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) I digitally enhanced it. Watch.(SFX: COMPUTER BEEP TONES B.G.) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) It looks like a Rorschach test. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (V.O.) It's part of a tattoo that was blurred by the acid. 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) What is that? 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) That is the tail of a dolphin. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Our victim was a submariner. 
 DUCKY: (V.O./FILTERED) Well, that would be a good guess. You know, the history of... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 DUCKY: (INTO PHONE) ...of tattooing is fascinating. Egyptian...(CONTINUES B.G.).... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: How many subs in port?(DUCKY CONTINUES B.G.) 
 MCGEE: Um... I'm copied on the daily movement report. 
 DUCKY: (V.O./FILTERED) ... preserved mummy. A woman of thieves, yes, whose tomb indicates that she was... 
 TONY: Interesting filing system, McGee.(DUCKY CONTINUES B.G.) 
 MCGEE: Um... three Los Angeles class attack subs in port at the moment. Another in dry dock. There were five, but the Philadelphia left at zero six hundred. 
 GIBBS: Get me copies of the ship's alpha rosters. 
 MCGEE: I'm on it. 
 GIBBS: (V.O./FILTERED)...around the pelvic region below the naval. Now this non-representational geometric style of tattooing... 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. DOCK - DAY 
 GIBBS: What if the body was put into acid not only to dispose of it, but... 
 KATE: But to make certain that it couldn't be identified. 
 TONY: Maybe the murderer didn't want us to know the submariner was dead. 
 GIBBS: Maybe. 
 MCGEE: Agent Gibbs! The alpha rosters. Everyone on the sub crews is accounted for. 
 GIBBS: Including the Philadelphia? 
 MCGEE: Yes, Sir. 
 GIBBS: A submariner's dead, but none are missing. And the dead man's identity was removed. Someone took his place on one of those subs. 
 KATE: An imposter? 
 GIBBS: Let's pay a visit to the Submarine Squadron Commander. 
 MCGEE: You want to avoid Captain Veitch. 
 GIBBS: What? 
 MCGEE: Um... well, I met him once before. Um... and he can be very difficult. 
 GIBBS: And you don't think that I can be difficult? 
 MCGEE: Um... I'm sure you can, Sir. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. VEITCH'S OFFICE - DAY 
 VEITCH: You're telling me somebody killed one of my sub crew members to take his place? 
 GIBBS: I think it's a very real possibility. 
 VEITCH: Not on my watch, Agent Gibbs. 
 GIBBS: Can you take that chance, Captain? It would have to be someone new. Humor me. 
 VEITCH: All right. I'll beef up security around the boats in port. Have every new crew members I.D. card checked against their service record. 
 GIBBS: What about the Philadelphia? 
 VEITCH: She's a day out. 
 GIBBS: Maybe you should call her back. 
 VEITCH: Agent Gibbs, the Philadelphia is about to join a NATO exercise in the Atlantic. And your theory is highly speculative if not preposterous. I'm not about to bring her back. 
 GIBBS: Then send Special Agent Todd and me to rendezvous with her and interview the new crew members. 
 VEITCH: Well, the presence of a woman on board a submarine is a tremendous inconvenience. You know that. 
 GIBBS: I do. 
 VEITCH: Don't you have another agent that you can take with you? 
 GIBBS: I do. Kate, step out. 
 (KATE WALKS O.S.) 
 (DOOR OPENS/ CLOSES) 
 VEITCH: Glad you understand. 
 GIBBS: I don't. 
 VEITCH: Excuse me? 
 GIBBS: Don't tell me how to run an investigation. Yeah, I've got other agents who can do the job but none as well as Special Agent Todd. Formerly she was attached to the President's Secret Service detail. Trained as a profiler. 
 VEITCH: I don't care what she was trained for. She's a woman! And females cannot be deployed on a submarine! 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
 KATE: What is this, Victorian England? The men with their cigars and brandy, while the ladies sip tea in another room? I'm more qualified for this investigation than Tony. To replace me because I shave my legs and not my face is unconscionable and certainly not in the best interest of the case. 
 GIBBS: Are you claustrophobic? 
 KATE: No. 
 GIBBS: Good! 
 KATE: I'm going? 
 TONY: Don't forget to wax. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 MUSIC IN: 
 INT. COD - DAY 
 KATE: I think I'm more excited to dive on a nuclear sub than I was flying Air Force One. 
 GIBBS: See if you're still as excited by the time we get there. 
 (INTERCUT SCENE/ COD LANDS ON THE CARRIER) 
 AIR OFFICER: Special Agent Gibbs. Special Agent Todd. Welcome to the Enterprise. Sorry your stay's so short. Your helo's standing by. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
 KATE: How do we get from the frigate to the submarine? Swim? 
 GIBBS: Close. 
 (INTERCUT SCENE/ HELICOPTER LANDS B.G.) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WHALE BOAT - DAY 
 KATE: I don't see a submarine. 
 (SUBMARINE BURSTS THROUGH THE WATER) 
 GIBBS: You see it now? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
 X.O.: (INTO MIC) Deck is clear. Hatch secured. 
 SKIPPER: Submerge the boat. Make depth two five zero feet. 
 X.O.: Submerge the boat. Make our depth two five zero feet. Chief of the Watch on the One M C. Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive! 
 (WARNING HORN B.G.) 
 (INTERCUT SCENE OF SUBMARINE SUBMERGING) 
 COB: (V.O.) ...five zero feet and passing. 
 SKIPPER: Welcome aboard the Philadelphia. I'm Commander Peters. This is my X.O., Lieutenant Commander Akron. 
 AKRON: Sir. 
 GIBBS: Special Agent Gibbs. Special Agent Todd. 
 AKRON: (V.O.) Can I help you with that, Ma'am? 
 KATE: No, I'm good. 
 SKIPPER: Why don't we go to the wardroom? X.O., take the Con. 
 X.O.: Aye aye, Skipper. COB, I have the Con. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WARDROOM - DAY 
 SKIPPER: I've quarantined the five men as requested. They said you'd fill me in. Fill me in, Special Agent Gibbs.(DOOR OPENS) 
 GIBBS: One of those men may not be who he says he is. 
 SKIPPER: I find that hard to believe. 
 GIBBS: A body was found at Norfolk. It was made unidentifiable, possibly on purpose. We have good reason to believe that he was a submariner. 
 KATE: Fifteen of your crew are new. Four have been eliminated by dental x-rays. Six can be ruled out because of ethnic origin or body type. 
 SKIPPER: So that's it? Your conclusions are based on suppositions? 
 GIBBS: Strong suppositions. 
 SKIPPER: I interviewed every one of those men when they boarded and examined their personnel files before they ever set foot on this boat. 
 GIBBS: We'd like that same opportunity, Skipper. 
 SKIPPER: You'll get your interviews, Agent Gibbs, but you need to understand this boat's about to commence an A-S-W exercise. 
 GIBBS: Anti-Submarine Warfare. An enemy sub tries to infiltrate the carrier battle group. 
 SKIPPER: We're tasked with intercepting and destroying it... theoretically, anyway. 
 KATE: One of our subs plays the enemy? 
 SKIPPER: The Augusta. Her Skipper and I have a bottle of Stoli riding on who wins. So you can see why I want those five men back at their duty stations, A-SAP. 
 GIBBS: Well, we have a better reason keeping one of those men out of their duty stations, Skipper. I'd like the COB for security purposes to keep the men from talking to each other. 
 SKIPPER: That's affirmative. 
 (DOOR OPENS/ CLOSES) 
 GIBBS: COB. Chief of the Boat. 
 KATE: Thank you. 
 GIBBS: You're welcome. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 (SFX: MUSIC PLAYS B.G.) 
 DUCKY: Ah, it's coming along. 
 ABBY: Yeah. It looks like he's going to be kind of a hunk. He's got a good strong chin. 
 DUCKY: I agree. Sort of Cary Grant-ish. 
 ABBY: I was thinking more Hugh Grant-ish. 
 DUCKY: Any luck with his stomach contents? 
 ABBY: Well, there's good news and bad news. 
 DUCKY: I hate it when you play this game, Abby. All right, let's get it over with. 
 ABBY: His last meal was a Big Mac and fries. 
 DUCKY: Probably half the base had that for lunch. I was hoping you'd come up with something a little more exotic. Tandoori, perhaps. And the good news? 
 ABBY: I know what's in the Special Sauce. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WARDROOM - DAY 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 GIBBS: Enter. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 GIBBS: Petty Officer Drew. 
 DREW: Yes, Sir. 
 GIBBS: Have a seat. 
 DREW: Yes, Sir. 
 KATE: Would you give us your right thumb print, please? 
 GIBBS: That would be your other right thumb, Petty Officer. 
 DREW: Oh. Sorry, Sir. I'm a little nervous. 
 GIBBS: It says here you're from Boston. 
 DREW: South Boston actually, Sir. 
 GIBBS: There is a difference? 
 DREW: Well, if you're from Boston there is. 
 GIBBS: You just joined the ship from the... 
 DREW: The Topeka, Sir. S-S-N Seven Fifty Four out of San Diego. 
 KATE: Did you request sonar? 
 DREW: Yes, Ma'am. I talked to the recruiter about it. I've always been into electronics. I built my own guitar amp when I was a kid. 
 (PASSAGE OF TIME) 
 GIBBS: You enlisted when you were nineteen, Petty Officer Thompson? 
 THOMPSON: Right out of high school, Sir. 
 KATE: Nineteen? That's old to graduate high school. 
 THOMPSON: I got Mono. I was home my junior year. They put me back. May I ask what this is about? 
 GIBBS: No. 
 KATE: I need your thumb print, please. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BERTHING - DAY 
 DREW: What'd they ask you? 
 THOMPSON: Stupid stuff. About my high school... 
 COB: Thompson! You heard the man. There is no discussing your interview! 
 THOMPSON: Aye aye, COB. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WARDROOM - DAY 
 GIBBS: Petty Officer Thompson was lying about graduating high school at nineteen. 
 KATE: He paused and looked to his left. Usually means the response is fabricated. If he would have looked to his right, he'd be recalling a memory. 
 GIBBS: (OVERLAP) A memory. 
 KATE: You've had profile training. 
 GIBBS: What I have had is about a thousand interviews. After awhile you start picking up on things. 
 KATE: Why would Thompson lie about his age? 
 GIBBS: I don't know. Why did Seaman Riggs lie about being married? Why did Petty Officer Drew lie about a year in college? 
 KATE: Well, maybe Riggs is secretly married and Drew never finished a full year. 
 GIBBS: Everybody has something to lie about....which means we have nothing. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 SKIPPER: Sonar, still no sign of Augusta? 
 SONAR: No joy, Sir. 
 SKIPPER: Let's come about for another pass. 
 SONAR: Aye aye, Sir. 
 SKIPPER: I understand you've completed your interviews. 
 GIBBS: For now. 
 SKIPPER: I need them at their duty stations. 
 GIBBS: I'm concerned about the safety of your boat, Skipper. 
 SKIPPER: Your concern will be noted. XO, have the COB return the men to duty. 
 X.O.: Aye aye, Skipper. 
 GIBBS: How could someone harm this boat from the inside? 
 SKIPPER: We're vulnerable to any number of things. Chlorine introduced to the recirculated air could be fatal to the crew. Salt water in the battery compartment could cause an explosion. The missiles and torpedoes are obvious dangers. I could go on, but what's the point? 
 GIBBS: The point is one of those men may be an intruder. 
 SKIPPER: I don't believe that to be the case. I trust every man on this crew. I'll make arrangements to get you back to the carrier. 
 GIBBS: We'll leave, Skipper, when we're done. Not before. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 DUCKY: You were right, Abby. He's quite a handsome fellow. 
 ABBY: Yeah, unfortunately he doesn't look like any of the guys that Gibbs suspects. 
 DUCKY: Could our leader's golden gut be wrong this time? 
 ABBY: I've got to email this dude to Tony and see if anyone at Norfolk recognizes him. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. MCGEE'S OFFICE - DAY

 (BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, it's coming through. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) So are you getting lonely down there by yourself, hon? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Oh, I'm not alone. I'm with Special Agent McGee. Say hello. 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) Hey McGee. How's your Sig hanging? 
 MCGEE: (INTO PHONE) Uh... 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Gotta go, Ab.(END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 MCGEE: What's she look like? 
 TONY: Who? 
 MCGEE: Abby. She sounds cute. 
 TONY: Not your type. 
 MCGEE: Well how do you know that? 
 TONY: Have you ever had the slightest urge to tattoo your buttocks, McGee? 
 MCGEE: I don't think so. 
 TONY: Then we need never speak of her again. Make copies and circulate them around the base. See if anyone recognizes the guy. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
 DREW: I've acquired a target, Sir! 
 X.O.: Distance? 
 DREW: Six thousand one hundred yards. 
 X.O.: Bearing? 
 DREW: Zero three five relative. 
 X.O.: Depth? 
 DREW: Four hundred and fifty feet. 
 SKIPPER: Helm steer zero nine five. Fifteen degrees down bubble. 
 COB: Aye aye, Sir. Helm, zero nine five. Fifteen degrees down bubble. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WARDROOM - DAY 
 KATE: The fingerprints we took match those in their service records. If there's an imposter, it's not one of the five we interviewed. 
 GIBBS: It has to be. 
 KATE: What if he's on another boat? 
 GIBBS: This is the one that makes sense. The killer didn't just dump the body, he removed identifying features in case it was found. If it were found he knew it'd take between twenty four and forty eight hours for AFDIL to make a DNA match. 
 KATE: Whatever he was planning to do, it was going to be in that time frame. 
 GIBBS: In that time frame the Philadelphia was the only boat going out. Where'd you get the records? 
 KATE: Personnel office at Norfolk. 
 GIBBS: What if someone altered the service record before we or Commander Peters got it? 
 KATE: Meaning that the imposter worked in the personnel office. 
 GIBBS: Or has an accomplice. 
 (MUSIC OUT) 
 MUSIC IN: 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
 DREW: Sonar signature looks like the Augusta! Six thousand one hundred yards. 
 X.O.: Target bearing? 
 DREW: Still zero three five relative. We're in his baffles, Skipper. 
 SKIPPER: Range? 
 DREW: Six thousand yards and closing, Skipper. 
 SKIPPER: I've got you, Jimmy! 
 GIBBS: I need to contact NCIS headquarters now! 
 DREW: (V.O.) Range to target five thousand eight hundred and closing. 
 SKIPPER: No can do, Agent Gibbs. I'm about to win a bottle of Stoli. WEPS, get me a firing solution. 
 GIBBS: Your bottle of vodka is going to have to wait, Skipper. I need to talk to headquarters now! 
 SKIPPER: We'd have to break contact and go to periscope depth. 
 GIBBS: Whatever it takes. 
 SKIPPER: I am not terminating this exercise so you can have a chat with the folks back home. 
 GIBBS: Let me give this to you straight, Skipper. There's a threat on this boat. It's a real threat. It's not a game. 
 SKIPPER: X.O. 
 X.O.: Sir. 
 SKIPPER: Make your depth one five zero feet. Sonar, see if you can hang onto it. Take us up to periscope depth. 
 X.O.: Aye aye, Sir. Go depth one five zero feet. Slow to all ahead two thirds. Stand by to go to periscope depth. 
 SKIPPER: I'll give you two minutes, Special Agent Gibbs.

 THOMPSON: COB, why did we stop the attack on the Augusta?

 ABBY: Ah, I hate payback! 
 DUCKY: Which first? 
 ABBY: Bad. 
 DUCKY: No DNA matches on our victim. The AFDIL computers are still down. 
 ABBY: Okay. Good. 
 DUCKY: I know why Hugh Grant didn't match any of the photos. 
 ABBY: Okay, you got your payback. Tell me why. 
 DUCKY: Gibbs thinks one of the service records was altered. 
 ABBY: So all of this was a waste of time? 
 DUCKY: Au contraire. All we have to do is get photos of those five crew members from an independent source. 
 ABBY: That'll take longer than a DNA match. 
 DUCKY: I have photographs of every cricket team I ever played on from second form all the way through to the upper sixth. You see in our last year we made the division finals. Grant you I was only on the reserve. 
 ABBY: I just know that there's a point here somewhere. 
 DUCKY: All ships have a crew photograph. 
 ABBY: Yes. Yes! Yes! I'll download crew photos from websites of the five suspect's previous deployments! 
 DUCKY: You should have seen me in my whites. I was rather handsome even if I do say so myself.

 INT. PERSONNEL BUILDING 
 CONNORS: (V.O.) When a sailor reports to Norfolk, we download their service file, (ON CAMERA) update it if necessary and make a hard copy for the sailor's command. 
 TONY: You update their photos? 
 CONNORS: Only on re-enlistments and significant promotions. Most updates are performance evaluations, awards, marital status... 
 TONY: So your department can change anything in a service record? 
 CONNORS: Yes. 
 TONY: Fingerprints? 
 CONNORS: We could. But why would we? 
 TONY: Who handles Submarine Command? 
 CONNORS: Everyone. We don't assign work based on specific commands. 
 TONY: About how many people work here, Lieutenant? 
 CONNORS: Four officers, twelve enlisted and forty seven civilians. 
 TONY: That's a lot of people. 
 CONNORS: They don't think so. We've been swamped since Iraq with all the transfers in and out of here. 
 TONY: So you wouldn't know who handled crew replacement for a specific ship? 
 CONNORS: No, but I could ask. They might remember. 
 TONY: They might remember but I don't think they'd tell us. 
 CONNORS: Why not? 
 TONY: I promise to tell you some day. Can I have a copy of your personnel roster? 
 CONNORS: As long as you keep your promise. Josie, I need a copy of our personnel roster. 
 JOSIE: (V.O.) Right away, Lieutenant. 
 MCGEE: Uh, Sir? 
 TONY: Yeah. 
 MCGEE: May I ask the Lieutenant a question? 
 TONY: Micky, you don't need my permission to ask a question as long as you're not asking her on a date. 
 MCGEE: No, Sir. Not my type. 
 TONY: Lieutenant, Special Agent McGee has a question. (TO MCGEE) McGee? 
 MCGEE: Uh...I was just wondering if anyone had quit in the last few days. 
 CONNORS: As a matter of fact, Joshua Fox quit two days ago. 
 TONY: How long did he work here? 
 CONNORS: A little over a year. He transferred into personnel a month ago. 
 TONY: Could you get us his address? 
 CONNORS: Thanks. It's on the roster.

 GIBBS: Drink it. (LONG BEAT) So how's your bladder? 
 KATE: What?! 
 GIBBS: The COB's at the end of the passageway trying to keep an eye on us. You've got to distract him. You're gonna need help working the toilet.

 KATE: Is that why you've been shoving water down my throat for the past hour? 
 GIBBS: I want to check out Petty Officer Thompson. 
 KATE: Yeah, well you don't have to drown me. You could just ask. 
 GIBBS: Hydrating's good for you. Go on, unhydrate. 
 (DOOR CLOSES/ OPENS) 
 KATE: I've never heard it called that before. 
 GIBBS: Go on!

 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 TONY: Well, either no one's home or not answering. 
 MCGEE: What should we do? 
 TONY: Get inside, look around. 
 MCGEE: We'll need a Command Search Authorization. This is civilian property, Sir. We'll have to go to a local judge to get a search warrant. (TELEPHONE BEEP TONES) 
 TONY: Or play football. 
 MCGEE: Huh? 
 TONY: Go deep. Go deep! Oh, look at him! He breaks free! Go man, go! He's looking for McGee! It's a play action to attack and even to balk and he can't find McGee! He's covered! He's in the open! He's broken clear! 
 (SFX: GLASS BREAKS) 
 TONY: He's still got it. 
 MCGEE: That's breaking and entering. 
 TONY: No.(SFX: GLASS BREAKS) 
 TONY: No, that was breaking. This is entering.

 THOMPSON: We're going to need a torque wrench. 
 SEAMAN: I'll get it. 
 GIBBS: You trouble me, Thompson. 
 THOMPSON: How's that, Sir? 
 GIBBS: I don't think you were completely honest with us. 
 THOMPSON: Yes, I was. 
 GIBBS: I think you lied about high school. Why would you do that? 
 THOMPSON: The truth, Sir? 
 GIBBS: Oh, yeah. That's always the best. 
 THOMPSON: I missed a year of high school 'cause I was in juvenile detention. My record was expunged but I was afraid if the Navy found out, I'd never see the inside of a sub. 
 COB: Agent Gibbs. You were asked to stay in the wardroom. (TO THOMPSON) You can go back to work, Petty Officer. 
 THOMPSON: Aye aye, COB. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO:

 GIBBS: (WHISPERS) Busted! 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 COB: I didn't appreciate that little stunt 
 GIBBS: Ah, cut us a little slack. No harm no foul. 
 COB: No, Sir. The Skipper's cooperated with you every step of the way. 
 GIBBS: Chief of the Boat knows the crew better than the Skipper. Are you bothered by any of the men we questioned? 
 COB: You've only been out one day, Agent Gibbs. I make it a practice not making snap judgments. 
 KATE: It could be something little. Seemingly inconsequential. 
 GIBBS: Do you get a strange vibration about any of them? 
 COB: No, but if I do get any vibrations, it'll come to you through the Skipper. 
 (COB WALKS O.S.) 
 (DOOR OPENS/ CLOSES) 
 KATE: Do people react that way because we're NCIS or do you just have that affect on them? 
 GIBBS: I'd like to think it's me. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 ABBY: I downloaded crew photos from the ships our suspects served on and I got nada. No one looks like him in any of them. I don't know what to do now? 
 DUCKY: Absent a miracle, we'll just have to wait for the DNA report. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. JOSHUA FOX'S HOUSE - DAY 
 (MUSIC OVER ACTION/TONY LOOKS AROUND THE CABIN) 
 TONY: I don't think this guy's ever cooked in his kitchen. No plates, no utensils, nothing. 
 MCGEE: It's all store bought junk. There's not one personal item here. Not even a phone. 
 TONY: Well, maybe he used his cell phone. What's that? 
 MCGEE: It's a DSL line. It's running from this jack to...under the bookcase. 
 TONY: All right, slide this toward you on three. One, two, three.

 MCGEE: Let's see what we have here. 
 (SFX: RAPID KEYBOARDING) 
 TONY: You've taken computer classes. 
 MCGEE: Masters in computer forensics, MIT. 
 TONY: I see. 
 MCGEE: Well, he's definitely an eco-terrorist. He's looking for retribution for the whales. 
 (SFX: RAPID BEEP TONES) 
 MCGEE: Oh, this isn't good. 
 TONY: What? 
 MCGEE: Isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate. (BEAT) B.S. in Bio-medical Engineering, Johns Hopkins. You? 
 TONY: Ohio State, Phys Ed. I was a jock. What is that in my language? 
 MCGEE: Sarin gas. He's planning to introduce it into a submarine's air conditioning system. Doesn't say how. 
 TONY: It wouldn't take a lot, would it? 
 MCGEE: Must have been a prototype. 
 TONY: If it was filled with Sarin gas, and distributed through the air system? 
 MCGEE: It could kill the entire crew. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
 X.O.: (V.O.) Skipper, we have an incoming Emergency Action Message on the low frequency receiver, Sir. 
 SKIPPER: (READS) Imposter on board. No I.D. Threat of Sarin gas to air conditioning system. Take immediate action. (TO COB) Have engineering shut down the air conditioning system and tear it apart. And get those agents up here now! 
 COB: Aye aye, Sir. 
 SKIPPER: Surface! Surface! Surface! Emergency blow! 
 X.O.: Surface! Surface! Surface! Emergency blow! 
 SEAMAN: (V.O.) Emergency blow. Surface aye!

 KATE: Wow. 
 GIBBS: Yep. That's what they all tell me. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 ABBY: I remembered that I was absent the day the Science Club took our picture. And that made me think what if one of the five missed his crew picture? Petty Officer Drew. He was absent the day the Topeka took their photo. 
 DUCKY: Where'd you get this picture? 
 ABBY: I downloaded it off the sub's online newsletter. Drew is a Sonar Operator on the Philadelphia. 
 DUCKY: No, he's not. He's in my cold storage. Someone else is sitting at his sonar station. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
 DREW: Sir, request permission to make a head call. 
 COB: Emergency blow loosen you up, Petty Officer Drew? All right. Martin, relieve Drew. 
 SKIPPER: Open all hatches. Break out emergency breathing gear. 
 X.O.: Aye aye, Sir. Open all hatches. Break out emergency breathing gear. 
 SEAMAN: (V.O.) Aye, Sir. Ensign, one M-C all emergency... 
 SKIPPER: Any idea who the hell he is? 
 GIBBS: We're working on it.

 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Sonar operator. 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) That's right. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Spent a couple tours on attack subs before he was dishonorably discharged. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) Was he hooked up with the protesters outside the gates? 
 TONY: (V.O./FILTERED) FBI's checking that. But they think he and Joshua Fox... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) ...were part of some small three or four man cell of radical eco-whale freaks. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Did you get Fox and the rest of them? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 TONY: (INTO PHONE) Not yet. What's going on down there? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) We're on the surface. 
 (GIBBS SETS DOWN THE HEADSET)

 KATE: (INTO PHONE) Good guess.(END TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 X.O.: Secure from emergency breathing. 
 SKIPPER: Engineering's gone through the air conditioning system. It looks like he never got his canister into it. 
 GIBBS: It's somewhere on this boat. 
 SKIPPER: We'll search. But if it's as small as you say it is, it could be hidden just about anywhere. 
 GIBBS: If the canister remains sealed, it shouldn't be a problem. 
 SKIPPER: We'll tear the boat apart if we have to when we get to Norfolk. XO, prepare to dive. 
 X.O.: Aye aye, Sir. 
 KATE: We're going back down? 
 SKIPPER: We're fifteen knots faster submerged than on the surface. 
 GIBBS: I'd leave the air conditioning system offline as a precaution. 
 SKIPPER: I fully intend to. It's going to get hot in here. 
 GIBBS: Ah, we're used to taking heat. 
 CUT TO:

 ABBY: Huh -- 
 TONY: Hi, Abby. While the boss is away, huh?(MUSIC B.G.) 
 ABBY: I earned my paycheck today. 
 TONY: Oh, that's what I heard. Exhibit A. Any idea how it works? 
 ABBY: So what's agent McGee like? 
 TONY: Ah, like most newbies. Quiet, green, gullible. 
 ABBY: Bi? 
 TONY: I don't think so. 
 ABBY: No, Tony. The canister. There's a funny metal trigger. 
 TONY: Ah. Yeah. So it's turned on by either....either what? 
 ABBY: Hot or cold. 
 (SFX: WIND/BEEP TONES B.G.) 
 ABBY: This one digs cold. When the temperature drops below 5 degrees centigrade, the trigger releases whatever's in the canister. What is in the canister? 
 TONY: Sarin gas. 
 ABBY: Nasty. 
 TONY: Hmm. So what's cold enough to trigger it on a sub? 
 ABBY: Fridge, freezer, air conditioner. Is Agent McGee cute? 
 TONY: Can a guy be cute to you without body armor? 
 ABBY: Sure. I'm not a snob. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. WARDROOM - DAY 
 KATE: How can you drink coffee when it's a hundred degrees? 
 GIBBS: It helps me think. 
 KATE: What's bugging you? 
 GIBBS: Travis not releasing the Sarin. 
 KATE: He never had a chance. He was quarantined or on duty until the air conditioning system was shut down. 
 GIBBS: What was his back up plan? He would have had one. 
 KATE: What makes you so sure? 
 GIBBS: This whack job knew he was going to die as soon as he released the gas. Why commit suicide before he could do it? 
 KATE: He knew we were onto him. I mean, like you said, he was a whacko. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 GIBBS: Yeah. Enter.(DOOR OPENS) 
 MESS SPECIALIST: Courtesy of the Skipper, Sir, Ma'am. There's rocky road, cookies and cream, chocolate, butter pecan, and the Captain's personal favorite, pumpkin. 
 GIBBS: Pumpkin? 
 KATE: Do you think we have enough, Steward? 
 MESS SPECIALIST: There's about forty gallons more in the galley, Ma'am. Might as well eat it before it melts. 
 KATE: I don't get it. 
 GIBBS: Had to make room in the freezer for the body. 
 KATE: Nice. 
 MESS SPECIALIST: It's the only place to preserve it, Ma'am. SOP on a sub. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 KATE: (BEAT) What? 
 GIBBS: Anyone who's served on a sub knows that. Travis didn't commit suicide to give up. (DOOR OPENS) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
 GIBBS: Suicide was his backup plan. Where's the freezer, COB? 
 COB: Loading door right here, Sir. Right there. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 GIBBS: The b*st*rd booby-trapped himself. Once he knew that he couldn't get in the cooling system, he went to his backup plan before we could arrest him. 
 KATE: The Sarin gas canister was designed to be triggered by cold. Travis knew that if he died, you'd put him in the freezer. 
 COB: You mean he swallowed the canister? 
 KATE: Yeah. 
 GIBBS: If his core temperature gets to the trigger temperature, the gas will be released. 
 KATE: It already has! 
 GIBBS: When it leaks out, we're gonna die! 
 COB: I'll get the Skipper to do another emergency blo-- 
 GIBBS: There's no time for that! Kate, go fill in the Skipper. Come on! There's one way to get this guy off this boat in a hurry. Go! Move it! (GIBBS AND COB CARRY THE BODY ALONG THE PASSAGEWAY)

 THOMPSON: Get him out, guys! Come on! 
 SKIPPER: (V.O./OVER P.A.) Torpedo room, COB. 
 COB: (INTO RADIO) Torpedo room, COB.

 THOMPSON: Two flooding! 
 COB: Fire number one!

 TONY: No. 
 GIBBS: What are you doing here, Special Agent McGee? 
 MCGEE: I brought my final report, Sir. 
 GIBBS: You do not have to Sir me, McGee. 
 TONY: Didn't they teach you how to use e-mail at MIT? 
 KATE: You graduated from MIT? 
 GIBBS: And Johns Hopkins. 
 TONY: I didn't tell him. 
 GIBBS: What are you doing here? 
 MCGEE: I've uh... got a lunch date with Abby. 
 (TONY LAUGHS B.G.) 
 TONY: I've got to see this. I'll take you to her! 
 MCGEE: Thanks. 
 TONY: Thanks what? 
 MCGEE: Tony? 
 TONY: Sir. I already warned you, Abby's not your type. 
 MCGEE: Well, I'd like to find out for myself. 
 TONY: Yeah, listen kid uh... I don't want to hurt your feelings but you're not exactly Abby's type. 
 MCGEE: I've taken care of that. Remember that urge we were talking about? I went with Mom. 
 (SFX: ELEVATOR DINGS/DOORS SLIDE OPEN AND CLOSED)
