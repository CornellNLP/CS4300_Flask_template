 Previously on "Colony"... 
 I know you took the file. 
 I didn't take anything from your house. 
 You get us something from that suit. 
 Holy sh1t, it worked. 
 Whoa, why are you taking the gauntlet? 
 Hennessy's gonna hold on to it. 
 We'll take good care of it. 
 What happened? Someone left a loose end at the safe house yesterday. 
 Will's in trouble. 
 His team raided one of the Red Hand safe houses. 
 Will found a kid hiding inside and helped him escape, and now they're out looking for the kid. 
 Who are you? You're not safe here. 
 Katie, we've got company. 
 Hey! 
 How did you escape the safe house? 
 They're gonna torture him. 
 Come on. We have to go now. 
 I will not tolerate... 
 Where are they? They've been relocated. 
 Bram. 
 Hey, we got to get in the air before a patrol spots us. 
 Plane hasn't been flown in over a year. 
 Just gotta make sure the engine doesn't conk out. 
 There has to be another way. 
 Yeah? Like what? 
 Teleportation? 
 This plane has no electronics. 
 They won't see us coming. 
 Yeah, but that's... see, that's just a theory. 
 It's a theory that's been tested. 
 Their sensors on the walls don't care about analog signals. 
 What about the drones? 
 We'll come out of the sun, and we'll bail out before they can spot us. 
 It's gonna work. 
 I hate flying. Yeah? 
 Should've thought of that before you volunteered. 
 We're good. Let's go. 
 Do you hear that? Yeah. 
 Come on. We gotta get out of here. 
 Are you okay? 
 Go ahead. 
 A plane flew in from outside the bloc. 
 Drone shot this guy down, but his partner escaped and went to ground. 
 Why would somebody want to fly a plane into the bloc? 
 I plan on asking him. 
 I didn't realize your wife was related to Madeline Kenner. 
 Yeah. They're sisters. 
 Oh, oh. 
 According to your file, they both grew up in a military family. 
 Navy. Mm. 
 Typically, military families are close. 
 Do they fight much? 
 Like I said, they're sisters. 
 How often does your wife go visit Ms. Kenner in the Green Zone? 
 What's with all the questions? 
 I just want to get to know the Bowman family a little bit better. 
 Let's talk about you, Bob. 
 What's your story? 
 Any family? Friends? 
 Or you just power down in a closet at work every night? 
 Oh, I've got a lot of friends. Good ones, actually. 
 Probably because I understand that our line of work and friendship doesn't mix. 
 Good talk. 
 We're gonna need to bag all this up for the Blackjacks. 
 Go get your equipment from the van. 
 The dead jumper is Darin Gunn, a former lieutenant in the Marines. 
 Seems to have been outside the Walls during the Arrival. 
 Yes. I don't care who he is. 
 I want to know what you're doing to find his partner, the one who escaped. 
 Let's not make this bigger than it is. 
 We'll cover up the crash site, I'll tell a convincing story, and by next week, nobody in my bloc will even remember what happened. 
 Recent reports from IGA intelligence indicate that there is a growing Resistance movement outside the Colony. 
 What if this was an attempt to recover our host's missing gauntlet and take it beyond our Walls? 
 That seems unlikely. 
 Well, it doesn't have to be true. 
 IGA simply needs to think that it's a possibility. 
 Let's not fixate on the worst-case scenario. 
 Things are trending upward in the bloc. 
 You're right. 
 I'll have to remember to remain optimistic as we're all being renditioned. 
 Find the pilot. 
 It'll be good for you and your bloc. 
 Understand? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 What's going on? I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd give you a ride to work. 
 Hey, so... when Bram wakes up, tell him to stay here, okay? 
 Okay. 
 We'll be home soon. 
 All they do is sleep. 
 They're boys, my love. They hibernate like bears. 
 See you tonight. Bye. 
 You think the pilot might still be alive? 
 He escaped into the bloc. 
 So we have to find him before the Occupation. 
 The dead jumper had a radio in his backpack. 
 I memorized the frequency and then scrambled it. 
 Will Bowman... that's a clever piece of sabotage. 
 Just trying to keep up. 
 I'll go to Broussard. 
 If the pilot really is Resistance, he might reach out. 
 Okay. 
 Come on, let's go! 
 Bob's been asking questions about you. 
 Do you think they broke the kid from the safe house? 
 I don't know. Don't go back to the office. 
 Once we disappear, the kids are fugitives... forever. 
 Let's meet for lunch, exchange notes, okay? 
 Be safe. 
 I will. 
 So Hennessey knew a plane was coming? 
 He didn't say that exactly. 
 But he told me he had spoken to a group outside the bloc that wanted to make contact. 
 I assumed he meant a cell that was in... 
 San Fernando or Santa Monica. 
 The green glove... something very valuable. 
 Listen, Blake, if you let me go, it's yours. 
 It's worth enough to make you rich for the rest of your life. 
 Yeah? Look at those gems. 
 Hey. 
 We came about the pilot. 
 In peacetime, I'm an art dealer, antiques. 
 Have a shop in London, Paris, even New York. 
 You've probably heard of it. 
 Never been there. 
 Blake... 
 We gotta go. 
 What... Come on, let's go. 
 Bowman is working for the Resistance. 
 I can't help but wonder whether your opinion in this matter is influenced by personal animosity. 
 We had cameras up on the Bowman residence. 
 Do you remember that "eyes only" file that was mysteriously downloaded from Deputy Proxy Burgess's home computer? 
 The deputy's girlfriend happens to be Katie Bowman's sister. 
 Last Tuesday, she went over to her house and accused her of stealing the file at a party. 
 Nolan Burgess is the Proxy's right-hand man. 
 Does that make him immune to the law? 
 Dig deeper. If you're right, maybe we can use Bowman to catch Broussard. 
 But tread carefully. 
 Where was he keeping the gauntlet? 
 Who else knew that Hennessey had it? 
 Nobody. Far as I know. 
 Hey, Will said the jumper was carrying a radio. 
 Could that be how Hennessey was in touch with him? 
 Well, this is a shortwave set. 
 That reach outside the bloc? 
 It can reach halfway around the world. 
 Los Angeles, this is Den Mother. 
 Do you copy? Over. 
 This is Los Angeles. Over. 
 I need today's code. 
 Hey. 
 What if it's like our old system, and all we need is the book? 
 Los Angeles, do you copy? 
 We have a, uh, situation here. 
 Our contact has been killed but, um... 
 Emergency protocol! 
 All outlets shift to signal two immediately! 
 Who the hell was that? 
 I've got a team going through the archive footage from the Bowman house, but he and his wife are almost scrupulously boring. 
 Like they know they're being watched. 
 We also found an odd anomaly. 
 Some of the earlier surveillance files are missing. 
 What do you mean, "missing"? 
 I thought we had built redundancies into the system. 
 We did. Which is how I knew the files must have been deleted. 
 I went back and examined the logs. 
 All the files were erased from the same computer terminal over a 15-minute period. 
 Jennifer McMahon. Yes. 
 See if you can find a way to restore that footage. 
 Hey. 
 How's the, uh, washing machine holding up? 
 Good. 
 I need a radio. 
 Got a lot of 'em. 
 I need a military-style radio, one with VINSON encryption protocol. 
 Hey, man, I just fix car stereos, man. 
 I-I wouldn't know anything about that. 
 It's for a case. 
 We're always looking for somebody at work to maintain our equipment. 
 It's extra rations, easy job. 
 I could put in a good word for ya. 
 Okay. 
 I've got nothing with VINSON. 
 Those things were collector's items even before the Occupation. 
 Say someone was listening on a certain channel with a VINSON set. 
 If I broadcast on a normal radio, would they be able to hear me? 
 Sure. They'd just know it wasn't encrypted. 
 I'm gonna need to borrow your equipment. 
 Uh, so you just hit that and, um... you're live. 
 Hello. I'm looking for the pilot who bailed out over Los Angeles this morning. 
 I can help you. 
 Help him? 
 Your partner's been killed, and the entire Occupation is looking for you, but me and my friends are on your team. 
 We just wanna talk. Over. 
 Emmett. 
 Emmett. 
 It's time for you to come clean. 
 When we hit your terrorist lair, you said that you hid in the crawl space. 
 But I know that isn't the whole story. 
 This man helped you. 
 I know something else. 
 When we came to arrest you at the other safe house, you ran out before we hit the door. 
 Because you were tipped... right? 
 I just had a bad feeling. 
 You're lying! 
 It's... obvious. 
 Did this man tip you again? 
 You know... 
 I doubt you're having a very enjoyable time here, Emmett. 
 But it could get much worse. 
 A lady came to my apartment. 
 Brown hair and eyes. 
 Skinny. 
 Do you remember that mysterious woman on the subway platform? 
 Broussard's accomplice... the one who helped him kill our Host. 
 I know who it was. 
 Katie Bowman. 
 Move, move, move! 
 You take left, I'll take right. 
 What are you doing here? Sit down. 
 Did my father send you? Sit down... 
 ... or I'll make you sit down. 
 Come here. All clear. 
 No sign of the wife, but we've got the three kids. 
 Sorry about Hennessey. 
 Was he a friend? No. 
 But I trusted him. 
 Which I guess these days is almost the same thing. 
 Your husband's late. 
 He'll be here. 
 Subject just took a right turn onto Beverly. 
 What are the rules of engagement if he's meeting his wife? 
 I wanna take them both. 
 We should hold out for Broussard. 
 Wait too long, and we might end up with nothing. 
 Okay, we move if he meets his wife. 
 Subject is stopping on the 4300 block of Beverly. 
 Will's blown. 
 What? 
 He just walked right past here and into a coffee shop. 
 Here you go. Thank you. 
 Charlotte's. 
 Is there an Alex Graham here? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 This is Graham. 
 What's going on? 
 I'm being followed. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'll try to slip 'em, but I can't make my move till you and the kids are safe. 
 Did you find out anything on the pilot? 
 Um... a contact of Broussard's, a guy named Hennessey. 
 We think that he knew that the pilot was coming. 
 Did you talk to him? We tried. 
 He's dead. Can we get up on that call? 
 Working on it. 45 more seconds. 
 He's on to us. I guarantee it. 
 We have to move! 
 Fine. 
 Take him down! 
 They're coming for me. 
 Get out of there! It's too late. 
 Get the kids and go underground, 'cause if they're coming for me, they're coming for all of us. 
 Hands in the air! 
 I love you. 
 Get down! Hands on the counter! 
 They might have tracked that conversation. 
 We've gotta go. 
 They took him. 
 Then there's nothing you can do. 
 You have to trust Will to handle himself. 
 My kids are in danger. Will you help? 
 Of course. 
 Did you know I was Internal Affairs before the Arrival? 
 Of course you were. 
 That's exactly the attitude I used to get from guys like you. 
 Never really bothered me. 
 The IA was the fence that kept the cowboys on the range. 
 And... you can never really blame a cowboy for hating a fence. 
 It turned out that my old job made me a perfect fit for this new world. 
 You see, we're not here to solve cases. 
 We're here to solve problems. 
 Nobody above us gives a sh1t about who did what and why. 
 They just want us all to stay on the range. 
 They cared who took the RAP. 
 That's a problem that I solved. 
 Because you were involved. 
 You're just throwing sh1t against the wall and hoping it sticks. 
 This is your wife. 
 On the subway platform... before the attack on our Host. 
 With Broussard. 
 That's not my wife. 
 Will... look at me. 
 I'm telling you, from one professional to another, I'm not fishing. 
 We have everything. 
 Including your kids. 
 Where are they? 
 Secure. 
 You've seen me work. 
 You know what I'll do to get what I need. 
 You can save them. 
 Just lead us to Broussard. 
 I can't. 
 He doesn't trust me. 
 But I can give you something you need almost as much as Broussard. 
 The pilot. 
 
 
 
 Don't listen to him. 
 Give me time... he will lead us to everything. 
 We don't have time. 
 Right now the priority is the pilot, and this department needs a win. 
 You want a win? 
 He is the real prize, the key to unlocking everything! 
 How can you get the pilot? 
 Is VINSON automatically activated? 
 Yeah. All outgoing transmissions will be encrypted. 
 Hello. I'm looking for the pilot who bailed out over Los Angeles. 
 I'm working with Hennessey. 
 We've been expecting your arrival. 
 What happened to Hennessey? 
 He's dead. 
 I'm one of his associates. 
 Well, Mr. Associate, I didn't free-fall into an occupied bloc just to end up in a dark cell. 
 So if we're gonna meet, it's gonna be on my terms. 
 Tell me what you wanna do. 
 Hey. 
 It's okay. 
 Mom and Dad'll be home soon. 
 I think Lindsey's dead. 
 Your tutor? 
 Um... look... 
 Lindsey wasn't your friend. 
 She was trying to brainwash you. 
 I thought it would be better when we were all back together. 
 But I miss our old house. 
 I miss Minny. 
 I just want things to be back the way they were. 
 Me too. 
 What's going on? 
 Get up there. 
 Take me through the plan. 
 I'll walk through the park. 
 The pilot will know to establish contact with me because I'm carrying this book. 
 When the pilot approaches, I will confirm her identity and then drop the book. 
 That'll be your signal to take her. 
 No funny business. 
 We have agents crawling all over that park. 
 Then you're doing it wrong. 
 If she smells something, she's gone. 
 They're professionals. She won't see anything. 
 Really? 'Cause I sniffed out your coverage in ten seconds. 
 Cut the number of agents in half unless you wanna blow this. 
 Fine. But if you don't bring her in... 
 I will. 
 I wanna talk to my kids first. 
 I need to know they're safe. 
 Put me through to the team holding the Bowman children. 
 All units: shots fired. 
 Multiple officers down. 
 What's going on with my kids? We're gonna miss our window. 
 We have to wait to get a report from that apartment. 
 I need that pilot. I'm not putting him out there unless I know we have some leverage. 
 It is not your call. 
 We have a sniper on you. 
 I got it. 
 Ice-cold drinks here! 
 Get your ice-cold drinks! 
 Copy. Reported two female, possibly armed. 
 Proceed with caution. 
 Sir, our team just cleared the apartment building. 
 The Bowman children are gone. 
 Do we have any description of the attackers? 
 Yes, the descriptions match Katie Bowman and Eric Broussard. 
 Be advised. Katie Bowman and Eric Broussard have abducted the Bowman children. 
 We need to abort this mission now. 
 Negative. Our objective remains the same. 
 Hey, man, take a soda. 
 $10. 
 I'm shutting this shitshow down. 
 Why are you pulling out now? 
 Something changed. 
 You lost your leverage. Get to the van. 
 Now! 
 Somebody stop him. 
 Freeze! 
 Freeze! 
 sh1t! 
 On your knees! 
 Uhh! 
 Are you the pilot? 
 Who the hell are you? 
 I'm with Broussard. The Occupation captured me and forced me to make that radio call. 
 I figured you were working with them when I saw the surveillance. 
 Did you see me stab that guy? 
 That's why you're still talking. 
 Let's go... move! 
 Where are we? 
 We're in the sewers, love. 
 How is Dad going to find us? 
 Well, Dad's really good at finding things. 
 He... he found Charlie in Santa Monica, right? 
 Hey, guys, listen... what happened at that apartment... 
 I was just trying to keep you all safe. 
 Do you understand? 
 Yeah. 
 We know. 
 Broussard lives here? 
 It's a good place to hide. 
 For how long? 
 Until things change. 
 Why'd the Redhats come for us? 
 What'd Dad do? 
 Your father was helping me... figure out... what's really going on in this bloc so that we can decide if this family's gonna stay or go. 
 You wanna run? 
 I thought you were in the Resistance. 
 Not now, Bram. 
 What's really going on with Dad? 
 Keep moving. 
 So I hear that the operation to capture the pilot was a complete disaster. 
 Yes. But we were able to eliminate a key mole at Homeland. 
 Because he escaped with the pilot. 
 Your relentless focus on the negative isn't productive. 
 I'm achieving some real gains in my bloc. 
 By what metrics, exactly? 
 Growth of the Greatest Day, expansion of our security apparatus... our youth. 
 None of that matters. 
 You came to me with a plan to fix the bloc, and you have failed. 
 I'm not the one who went to the IGA and made promises I couldn't keep. 
 I made those promises because I misplaced my trust in you. 
 Ah... 
 Are you gonna tell them that? 
 Helena, you can't fire me. 
 Not after you swore that I was your savior. 
 It'll blow back on you. 
 I'm going to... transfer some key personnel from the San Fernando bloc to Los Angeles, and I expect your full cooperation. 
 Here's the list. 
 No. 
 I believe in my people... and my approach, and I will not be undermined. 
 Very well. 
 That's all. 
 Get me Alan Snyder. 
 Shh, shh, shh! 
 Dad! 
 Thank you. 
 I made contact with the pilot. 
 She wants to meet you at a neutral site. 
 Why didn't she come here with you? 
 'Cause I almost walked her into an ambush. 
 Has to be her way. 
 Okay. 
 Turn around! 
 I've come a long way to meet you. 
 I hear you have a piece of alien technology. 
 Depends. Who's asking? 
 I represent a resistance group based outside the Colony. 
 How do we know that's even true? 
 You took part in an operation that went bad outside Herat in 2010. 
 The official version was that you responded to enemy sniper fire, but in reality, one of your men fired first after mistaking a bag of books for an IED. 
 Now, only five men on Earth knew this story. 
 Three of them are dead. I work for the other survivor. 
 He has a tattoo on his right arm. 
 Bugs Bunny holding a stick of dynamite. 
 My name is Noa. 
 Why did you come here? 
 Is it because of the attack on the RAP? 
 I'm here... because the real war is about to begin. 
 And that thing you stole... it's gonna help us win it.
