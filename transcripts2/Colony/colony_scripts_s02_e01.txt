 [bluesy music] 
 ♪ All right, Bram, order's up. Kitchen's closing. No iPad at the table, please, Charlie sir. [grumbles] Thank you. Good morning. Breakfast? I'll get something there. Daddy, look. Pretty. Old one or new one? New one. Dodgers signed new pitcher. Guy from Villanova. Hernando says his slider has starter potential. Excellent, excellent. Hey, Dad. Morning. ♪ What do you think about me coloring this gray? Um... [indistinct chatter] Hey. How you doing? You've been on another planet for days now. ♪ It's Devon. ♪ What'd she do? I'm not sure even I want to know all the details, but it's not good. Could it blow back on you? Okay, for real. What did she do? I think she got her hands dirty. [inhales deeply] What are your options? Tell the Bureau what I know or ask out. Seems easy enough. I mean, you don't have to make it about her, right? It's been a few years. You want a change. [door bell rings, dog barking] Could be the high road for both of you. Maybe. Yeah. Hey. We'll figure it out. Either way. I know. I love you. Love you. Break a leg. Hope it doesn't come to that. Morning. Morning. Hey. Oh. [laughs] Minnie, I love you too, sweetheart. [laughs] [sighs] Ah, good morning, Katie. Hey, girl. Morning, smaller Bowmans. Hey, Devon, you gonna go catch some bad guys today? Only if your dad doesn't slow me down. Nice. Are you ready to go? Hey, don't forget to, uh, pick up Charlie today, huh? Copy that. See you tonight. Copy that. [door closes] [tense music] ♪ [engine turns over] ♪ There's construction on Olympic. We should cut over to Colorado. All right. Thank you, Hal. It's Maps, Mom. Who's Hal? Hal retired.

But-- now we're in San Pedro. That's all right. I know how to get there the old-fashioned way. Watch this. I'm amazing. I've had three brokers tell me that was the best price they could get. Well, if you're gonna keep the house, then you're gonna be responsible for the payments. Don't get mad at me. This is what your lawyer mandated. I can't do this now. I'm at work. [indistinct chatter and phone ringing] Morning, Alan. Representatives from the textbook publishers are in your office. Who? Good morning, Alan. Good morning. We are very excited to talk to you. Who isn't excited about textbooks? [chuckles] We aren't here about textbooks. We're recruiting officers. We're with an agency called the Institute for Global Advancement. You're a man of vastly untapped potential, Alan. Your current employment in no way suits your talents. You were selected from a pool of tens of thousands of people. I don't recall applying for anything. You didn't. Our clients have an algorithm that pre-selects their clientele for them. And you happen to be the perfect man for the job. All right. You own two properties. A one-bedroom condominium and a home where you used to live with your wife and your daughter. You make your alimony payments on time, you help in paying for your daughter's private high school education, and you carry no unsecured debt. How do you-- You manage all this by making $72,800 a year as a purchasing manager for an unranked secondary education institution. How do you know all this? Who the hell are you? You've also managed, over a period of nine years, to divert a large amount of cash from this institution into an account held in the name of your long-deceased paternal uncle, also named Alan Snyder. ♪ You're a fascinating man, Alan. ♪ Alan, even great men make two or three critical mistakes in their lives. You don't get where I'm sitting by only making two or three mistakes. It's the choices you make today that will determine your future. All you have to do is say "yes." "Yes" to what, exactly? To meeting our client. [chuckles] You been in your house, what, like three years now? Four. Since before Gracie went to school. Oh, sh1t, that's right. Man, time is flying. Yeah, it is. [laughs] You remember your home inspection being so scary? I don't. [exhales] Everything on that report makes it sound like my bungalow's gonna burst into flames as soon as I close escrow. [laughs] [sighs] "So great you're gonna be a homeowner, Devon. I'm really happy for you, Devon." I am happy for you. What's with you? You've been an asshole ever since I told you I was gonna buy my place. How'd you find the money to buy a place in Santa Monica? What do you mean? [laughs] I know what I make. Pretty sure I know what you make. [chuckles] I've got an uncle who likes me. Gave me the down payment. Okay? Okay. What? You jealous? [laughs] I'm requesting a transfer. You're leaving Los Angeles? I'm staying in LA. I'm just gonna ask off the taskforce. Why? Because your relationship with the Armenians makes me uncomfortable. [exhales sharply] Is there something you want to ask me? We have relationships with criminals so that we can catch criminals. I don't wanna know any more than I already do. What, so you're gonna accuse me of being dirty, but I-I can't defend myself? I'm not asking you to defend yourself. I'm just asking for a transfer. Will, you're-- you're questioning my integrity. I wanna talk about it. I don't. [scoffs] You're unbelievable. [cell phone ringing] Five years we've been working together. [second cell phone ringing] [sighs] That's why I'm having this conversation with you and not the AD. Bowman. Yeah. [indistinct chatter] All right, listen up. ♪ Overnight, seven VIPs went missing in the LA area. The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, chief engineers at Lockheed and Boeing, an official with the Defense Nuclear Agency, and three senior military officers. Now, it appears that at least three of them were extracted by a militarized entity whose origin, at the present, is unclear. The others... well, the others are unaccounted for. Your department heads have your individual assignments. The goal is to bring these people back home safe. Can you share any theories as to what this is about, sir? Unfortunately, we don't know much of anything right now. We're trying to keep this operation as small as possible until we know more. We don't want to embarrass the Bureau or create a panic. Thank you. ♪ Still want to put in for that transfer, or you think you can suffer through another day with me? ♪ [exhales slowly] [gasps] Oh, my God. Eric! You scared the life out of me. [laughs] Sorry about that. [crying] I didn't know you were coming home. Oh, my goodness. Unplanned trip. [exhales] How's Mom? ♪ She sleeps a lot. I take her to dialysis Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays. In between, we do small errands. Grocery store, nail salon, those kinds of things. Thanks for this. Well, that's why you pay me the big bucks. [both chuckle] Hey, Ma. I'm home. [laughs softly] My... mm. ♪ Go back to sleep. [sighs] This is weird, right? Mm. Bunch of military intelligence guys and then engineers? Who knows? Some kind of coordinated terrorist attack, maybe. Turn here. I'm doing you a favor, you know. I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ I think our VIP's been downgraded from "missing" to "abducted". ♪ Hi, Special Agent Bowman, Special Agent Howard. FBI. Whatever that camera sees, it's not telling you anything. We're here to help you. If you're FBI, I want to see IDs. [quietly] Panic room. What's going on? Are you sure they left? I'm not coming out until it's safe. Try to stay calm, Mr. Lawes. The bad guys missed you. We're here to help. Our bosses are very interested in a bunch of VIPs that went missing last night. You were one of them. If you don't want our help, fine. Good luck to you. Got plenty of other stuff that we can be doing. [electronic lock beeps and clicks] [door creaks open] [soft dramatic music] ♪ [breathing heavily] [humming] Good morning. [chuckles] I have 9:00 PM. Are you jet-lagged? Thirsty. Welcome home. I'm just barely open. [static over TV] Sorry, I was hoping for some music. God, I haven't seen you in an age. What brings you back to the west? Better? [chuckles] Life changes. I plan to start by wasting a lot more time here. Good. We're happy to have you. Thank you for your service. ♪ Can I ask you a personal question? Depends how personal. You're a woman with a husband, couple kids. Why the bar? Um... purpose? I grew up watching my mom dedicate her life to being a mother and a wife to a naval officer, and I, uh-- it was important to me that my kids see me as more than that. Navy, huh? Didn't know that. "Not self but country." This a career crisis we're trying to drown here? ♪ I signed up when I was 19. Same as all the other hotheads. Thought I'd go whup ass, bring justice to a place that needed it, you know? I do. I married one of those hotheads. How was it for you? Did my tours, earned my experience. Then the private sector came calling. ♪ But there weren't any answers there either. They found Maria, my housekeeper, first. I snuck into my panic room and watched them search the house for 20 minutes, and then they left. They must have jammed my 3G radio. I couldn't get a call out. What kind of engineer needs a panic room? Good question. [sighs] I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list. What kind of list? There are about 1,200 people here in the US in the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered. If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it. [dramatic music] ♪ [indistinct chatter] [headphones click] [high-pitched drone] [dull thrumming] [breathing slowly] [discordant dramatic music] ♪ [footsteps approaching] [dramatic music] ♪ [exhales slowly] [low-pitched drone] [breathing heavily] They're asking you to make a choice, Alan. It's just the first of many that you'll have to make in your new position. If you don't feel that you're ready... [car door opens] 
 
 [knocking on door rapidly] Alan, what're you doing here? I-I need to talk to you. You can't just come in here without calling me first. I-- just listen to me. You need to pack a bag and go to your mom's. Wait, no, here we go again. You know what? The house is mine now, Alan. I-- that's not what I mean. I mean, you have to get out of Los Angeles and you have to go now. What are you talking about? I'm not going anywhere. Just, please, listen to me! I'm trying to help you! Dad? What's going on? [sighs] I need you to take a ride with me. What? No, no, no, she is not going anywhere either. Why? Because I'm your father, and I love you. Uh, we don't have a lot of time. The Hosts are only able to sequester a tiny percentage of the population. What the hell are you talking about, Alan? Okay, so look, I can only bring one person. Please, Cynthia, just do this for me, okay? No, no, no. Stop it, stop it. Who are these people? What're you-- excuse me? What're you doing here? Take my daughter. What is go-- Excuse me?

I don't know, sis, but, uh, how about this, you're gonna stay calm, you're gonna grab Hudson, and you're gonna meet us at the Yonk, okay? Oh, my God. Is this, like, September 11th or something? I mean, Rob's in the air. Okay, don't panic. Let's just be on the safe side. I'll see you soon. ♪ [indistinct chatter and phones ringing] ♪ Can we go talk outside? Okay. Hang tight. We need to get outta here. Now? Tell me your survival instinct isn't screaming right now. They need us. Whatever's going on out there, a couple of feds aren't going to make a difference. I can't just walk out of here. Who's walking out on who? See you around... partner. Appreciate that. I hope you have good news. We brought in our VIP. Which one? Tim Lawes. The Lockheed engineer.

They detonated an EMP in the upper atmosphere a few hours ago. Contact from SOCOM told us to bunker down here. The Axis powers rise again right under the nose of our entire defense and intelligence apparatus? I'm labor, brother. Not management. [dramatic music] Smells like sh1t. We need to get outta here. What? Whoever's behind this attack knows exactly what they're doing, and we just put every real operator in the city under one roof.
