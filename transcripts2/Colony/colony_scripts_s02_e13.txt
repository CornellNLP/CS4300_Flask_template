 Previously on "Colony"... 
 All I want is what you have in there. 
 Is it alive ? I don't think so. 
 Jesus Christ ! Katie. 
 I need today's code. 
 Our contact has been killed, but, um... 
 Emergency protocol. 
 All outlets shift to signal two immediately. 
 The gauntlet's not the only thing they're looking for. 
 Their onboard computer had a bunch of dossier files open. 
 They're looking for you. 
 We have a secure location in the desert. 
 And you can do something with the gauntlet? 
 We have a RAP. One of them defected. 
 Doesn't believe in what the rest of them are doing. 
 Our RAP just needs the gauntlet to tap into their communication. 
 It's the only piece we're missing. 
 We've got the target. Get out of there. 
 She can't... she can't be dead. 
 She never told us where her base was. 
 She never told us anything! 
 The drones showed up and opened fire. 
 One of them came down, just stared at me. 
 That happened to me, coming back from Santa Monica. 
 We just received word from our Hosts. 
 The Los Angeles bloc has been scheduled for Total Rendition. 
 Tact. 
 It's intact. Tact. 
 The Host unit. 
 It doesn't look like it got beat up too bad. 
 But it's unresponsive. 
 sh1t. 
 Its interface is missing. 
 Well, that's how we found it. 
 Let's pray the core is salvageable at least. 
 I know this is a terrible time to ask, but what happens if this doesn't work? 
 They'll probably nuke us from orbit. 
 Can you hear them? 
 Yeah. 
 Do exactly as they instruct you. 
 Do not deviate. 
 I have my instructions. 
 I'm beginning the procedure. 
 Our Host is online. 
 Hennessey's radio is over here. 
 This is Los Angeles. 
 I'm looking for Den Mother. 
 Anybody reading? Over. 
 I have the gauntlet, but I can't hold onto it for much longer. 
 I need to know where you are so I can deliver it. Over. 
 Come on, guys. Give me something. 
 The numbers Broussard found in Noa's gear. 
 7.250, 200. 
 4, 30, 72, 8, 11, 15... 
 56, 92, 10, 60... 
 What is that? 
 I think it's a numbers station. 
 72, 8, 11... 
 Old spy trick used a lot in the Cold War. 
 The numbers only make sense to somebody who knows what they're listening for. 
 So we need a code book? 
 Noa didn't leave one behind, did she? 
 4, 30, 72... 
 You think we're that lucky? 
 I would feel a lot better about leaving the Colony if I knew where we were going. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 92, 10, 60, 27, 4, 30, 72, 8, 11, 1. 
 Three more Blackjack units. 
 Add that to the eight this morning. 
 I want to know where those trucks are headed and what they're doing. 
 I have Blackjack teams in three unmarked trucks coming through the Downtown Gateway. 
 Let's put follow teams on them. 
 Not too close. I don't want them to know they're being watched. 
 Let's try to do this on radio. 
 Maintain standard patrols and report in with location updates. 
 Hey ! 
 Hey ! You can't sleep here Ma'am. 
 At least 50 busses for each ward. 
 Okay, yeah, pass that along. 
 It's always a pleasure, Mr. Snyder. 
 Busy day? 
 The Governor-General hasn't brought you up to speed? 
 Pretend she hasn't. 
 The bloc is being evacuated. 
 Evacuated to where? 
 San Fernando. 
 An effort to alleviate the supply shortages caused by the elimination of the labor and processing camps. 
 Those camps supplied the whole LA Colony. 
 San Fernando has to have the same supply shortages we do. 
 I can't speak for their situation. 
 So that's the official story. 
 And now, the real reason? 
 A recovery operation for the gauntlet. 
 Either we'll find it through border inspections during the evacuation or the Intelligence Directorate will lead an exhaustive search once the bloc is emptied. 
 That seems tedious. 
 What happens to the Green Zone? 
 The whole Los Angeles bloc is being cleared out for the effort. 
 What's going on? You didn't see the tail you picked up? 
 Blackjacks. 
 They must have had eyes on Hennessey's place. 
 You led them right to us. 
 We got to get the kids out of here. 
 Guys! 
 What's wrong? We gotta go. 
 Where? 
 We're leaving. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Let's go, come on. 
 Bram. 
 You remember what Dad and I showed you? 
 I'll be right inside. 
 You don't let them take your brother and sister. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. Come on. 
 Flash bang! No! 
 Morgan! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Katie! 
 Cover! 
 Get the kids! 
 Everyone okay? 
 Good morning, Alan. 
 This whole "evacuating to San Fernando" thing is a convincing cover story, so long as you're too ignorant or terrified to start pulling at the threads. 
 Were you going to tell me? 
 I got the call last night. 
 You were in such a good mood, I didn't want to ruin it. 
 By giving me a heads-up that the world was coming to an end? 
 I have defended this bloc as long as I can. 
 But it's become a nightmare. 
 For us and them. 
 Them being the RAPs? 
 There's a faction of hardliners amongst our Hosts and... they've been demanding action for months. 
 There are moderate aliens? 
 Yes. 
 And they were overruled. 
 And in light of Alcala's regime, I can't say that I disagree with them. 
 So that's it? 
 They flip a switch and turn Los Angeles into glass. 
 Well, actually, they've rethought that approach. 
 It was causing labor shortages. 
 Dare I ask what they're planning instead? 
 Total Rendition. 
 I did everything that I could... we... we did everything that we could, but... the decision has come from above, so. 
 Far above. 
 How long do we have? 
 It begins in six hours. 
 Uh, would it be crass at this point in the conversation to ask what this all means for me? 
 I'm being transitioned into a position with the Global Authority. 
 I've carved out a place for you on my staff. 
 Europe? 
 I thought it was a fairly generous offer, given where you were just a few weeks ago. 
 My daughter. 
 It's already been taken care of. 
 She can't come with us. 
 But I put her name on the exemption list myself. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't overthink it, Alan. 
 Go home and get your affairs in order. 
 I'll send a car for you. 
 Katie? You can say no. You probably should. 
 I didn't know where else to go. 
 Hm. 
 What can I do to help? 
 We won't stay long. 
 Just a few hours to regroup. 
 I'll put on some tea. 
 We need to keep our heads down and dig another trench. 
 We need to leave the bloc. 
 I don't see how that's an option. 
 Our kids can't live underground. 
 I didn't say you should be happy about it. 
 We can't. The kids have been through too much already. 
 I wish there is another way. There isn't. 
 We could contact Snyder. 
 What? 
 What are you gonna offer him, Will? 
 Me? 
 The gauntlet. 
 No. 
 My team died for that thing. 
 We might all die because of it. 
 Doesn't mean I'm gonna hand it to Snyder. 
 You go with us, you live to fight another day. 
 You stay here with the gauntlet, you're dead. 
 Remain calm. Everybody's gonna get something. 
 Excuse me. 
 Um, there is a line, miss. 
 I'm Maddie Kenner. 
 We know who you are. 
 If you wish to begin atonement and recommit yourself to the faith, then you can wait in line with the others. 
 Recommit? 
 I'm a seventh level member. 
 I founded this temple. 
 The Greatest Day teaches us that humility is one of the key pillars in a life of service to our Hosts. 
 Perhaps beginning your journey anew could set an example for others who have found themselves lost. 
 Sir, a call just came in from Homeland's anti-terrorism tip line. 
 They're asking for you specifically. 
 For me? Want me to patch you through? 
 Why not? 
 Hello? 
 Heard you were back in town. 
 If you want to catch up, call me back from a public phone. 
 0107. 
 Uh... 
 I need a public phone. 
 Heard your people are all looking for something. 
 I can get it. 
 What are you asking in exchange? 
 Relocation outside the Colony. 
 This is all a lot to ask, even for the spirit of an old friend. 
 I'm giving you my word. 
 That still counts for something, doesn't it? 
 Let's say I get past my healthy skepticism. 
 Where would we meet? 
 Brothers and sisters, our glorious Hosts... have brought us a great blessing today. 
 Salvation from the difficult conditions in our bloc. 
 We are all being relocated to the San Fernando bloc... where the faith stands strong... and resources are plentiful. 
 Busses will transport you to the evacuation center immediately. 
 Trust, trust in your faith... to navigate you through hardship and you will be rewarded. 
 Please approach the busses. 
 Form single-file lines. 
 There will be plenty... 
 Hey, come on. All right, move it on the bus. 
 Get off me. 
 Do you understand what you did? 
 I don't care what it takes. 
 I want them found. 
 Commander, thank you for meeting me on such short notice. 
 I don't have a lot of time, Mr. Snyder. 
 None of us do, from what I understand. 
 What do you want? 
 Does the Global Authority still have any interest in reclaiming the stolen gauntlet? 
 I mean, that's what started this whole hullabaloo in the first place, isn't it? 
 I figure it must still have some value. 
 You have access to it? 
 I deal in information. 
 I deal in absolutes. 
 If I could somehow provide information that led to the gauntlet's recovery, what would it be worth to the Global Authority? 
 You're asking that as a representative of the Governor-General? 
 Today, I'm representing myself. 
 If you were to be the one to lead us to the gauntlet, I promise you, Mr. Snyder, you'll never want for anything again.

 ♪ But I know we'll meet again.>♪ 
 ♪♪ That's it. Ta dam.. Ta dam. 
 ♪ Excuse us. Detective. But the bloc is being eliminated. 
 Eliminated ? 
 We have orders to pull you and your family out of the colony 
 ... and move you to our mountain facility. 
 Give me a minute. 
 Need to roll out in 5. Sir. On the clock. 
 How is a vacation in the mountain sound ? 
 ♪ Some sunny day.>♪ 
 Jesus Christ! 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 You said we were doing this alone. 
 I said for you to come alone. 
 He's here to prove I'm serious. 
 Okay, I get it. You're serious. 
 The truth. 
 If we make a trade, do you have the juice to get us out of the bloc? 
 Is the gauntlet here? 
 Course not. Good. 
 I want to come with you. 
 Why? 
 Because our Hosts have decided that Los Angeles is no longer in their future plans. 
 Total Rendition is coming. 
 What the hell is "Total Rendition"? 
 Our glorious Hosts come into the bloc, round up every human they can find, and take them to the Factory. 
 Just like that. 
 Why? Why are they doing this? 
 To put it bluntly... because of him. 
 And they didn't give you an out? 
 Oh, they did. 
 The Governor-General, bless her heart, promised to... transition me into an administrative position at the Global Authority. 
 Well, that sounds a whole lot better than what we're facing. 
 I know you might not believe it, but I do have a conscience. 
 After spending the day watching the rats all flee the sinking ship, I decided... 
 I just don't want to be a rat... anymore. 
 Snyder wants to come with us. 
 What do you make of all this? 
 I don't like it. 
 We could maybe keep running, but not the kids. 
 I'd rather be on the run and stay alive than turn myself in. 
 We're not turning ourselves in. 
 Men like Snyder always have an angle. 
 Maybe his angle is he just wants to live through this. 
 He needs us, that's why we can trust him. 
 I'm not saying this isn't a huge risk or that it isn't as dangerous as hell... it is. 
 But if we don't do something, we're just waiting around to get caught. 
 Sorry to interrupt, but it's the Occupation. 
 It's an automated call. 
 They said the bloc's being evacuated. 
 There are evacuation centers in every... ward. 
 They're asking people to report immediately. 
 Snyder was telling the truth. 
 Hey, guys, so, Dad and I have to go do something. 
 Where are you going now? 
 It's okay. 
 We'll be here together, all right? 
 Mom and Dad have a good plan. 
 What you doing with that? 
 I'm staying. 
 When you get outside, you need to make contact with Noa's people and get this to them. 
 We sacrificed a lot for it. 
 It'd be good to know it counted for something. 
 We'll do everything we can. 
 Come with us. 
 The Occupation's gonna be tearing apart the bloc looking for me. 
 
 
 
 I don't want to disappoint them. 
 Take care of yourself. 
 You too. 
 Please maintain order as you enter the evacuation center, and have your identification cards ready for surrender. 
 New documents will be issued to you at your final destination. 
 Food and water rations are available for distribution once you have been processed.

 I think San Fernando will be good. 
 It'll be nice to finally have enough rations. 
 You know? Your attention, please. 
 Once identification has been... 
 No kids? 
 We ask that you patiently wait... 
 I have a son. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I didn't mean to pry. It's okay. 
 He's safe. 
 Come on, hand 'em over. 
 Let's go. 
 Just ask somebody! 
 Wrong way. I made a mistake. 
 Back up. 
 I shouldn't be here. 
 Are you all right, sir? 
 Lose the weapons and get on your knees. 
 What? Whoa. 
 Sir? Sorry. 
 All right. All right, put it down. 
 Strip. What? 
 Strip now. 
 Attention, citizens. 
 Please make your way to your assigned evacuation centers. 
 Come, come. Okay, come on. 
 Go, go, go. Right, right out there. 
 Right there. 
 It's okay. 
 There's room. 
 We can take you with us. Ah, no. 
 You need to stay indoors. 
 Don't believe anything the Authority says. 
 If you can find a place to hide underground for the next few days, even better. 
 Go, go. Okay. 
 Let's go, come on. 
 Him? 
 No. No way. 
 I'm not going with him. 
 He's our ticket out of here. 
 You must be Charlie. 
 Heard a lot about you. 
 I'm Alan. 
 Hi. 
 You made us breakfast. 
 Was it any good? 
 You made eggs. 
 I don't like eggs. 
 I'll try to remember that. 
 All right, let's saddle up. We're hitting the road. 
 Gateways are closed. 
 I'm a special envoy to the Governor-General. 
 I'm escorting these children to a youth camp. 
 Her orders. 
 Move into the exclusion zone. 
 Tell your story to my sergeant. Thank you. 
 One vehicle coming through! 
 That's it. Clear. 
 All right, move forward. 
 Hold it right there. 
 Are you the sergeant? 
 Let me see your papers. 
 Alan Snyder. 
 As I'm sure your officer mentioned, I'm with the Governor-General's office. 
 You know we're under evacuation protocol? 
 That's exactly what I'm trying to do here. 
 My orders are to escort these children out of the Colony. 
 I'm no different than you, Sergeant. 
 Just a loyal soldier, following orders. 
 What happens if he calls the Governor-General's office? 
 She already evacuated. 
 They won't be able to reach her. 
 This is taking too long. 
 Everybody, get ready to put your head down if I say so. 
 If you do anything other than stick to our story, this is all over. 
 It's legit. Everything right. 
 Pull 'em out. Yes, sir. 
 I need everybody to step out of the vehicle. 
 What? Why? 
 Step out now please, sir. 
 The Governor-General will not be happy to hear we're delayed. 
 Just move away from the vehicle, please. 
 You. 
 What's your name? 
 Alex. 
 Alex what? 
 Sullivan. 
 Show me your ID. 
 I don't have it. 
 Sir. 
 What's that? 
 It's the Governor-General's business, not yours. 
 What are you... what are you doing? 
 What... keep your mask on, Officer! 
 Drop your weapon! 
 Drop your weapon and raise your hands! 
 Drop it! Put 'em down! 
 You all know who we are. 
 So you know how desperate we must be to try this. 
 They didn't tell you what's happening, did they? 
 Why they doubled up the shifts this morning. 
 Or told you to seal the gateway and hold it no matter what you hear. 
 The bloc's being evac'd. 
 That's their cover story. 
 What's really happening is Total Rendition. 
 The RAPs are gonna send the whole bloc... to the Factory. 
 All of us, me, my wife, my kids, you, and all of your families. 
 Bullshit. It's true. 
 Everyone on the exemption list has already been taken out of the bloc. 
 Radio the San Fernando gateway. 
 If there's really an evacuation, they would be processing thousands of people already. 
 Call them. 
 Yeah, this is One-Victor-Five at the Downtown Gateway. 
 Patch me through to San Fernando. 
 There's no response. 
 Try it again. 
 I want a direct line. 
 There's no one there. 
 That's because they're lying to you. 
 They don't want you to know what's happening. 
 Could be anything. 
 You willing to bet your life on it? 
 And your family's? 
 We're all inmates in the same prison. 
 They take what they need, and then we're disposable. 
 Drop your weapon. 
 I can't do that. 
 You drop your weapon, you do it now. 
 We've made different choices, but we all made them for the same reasons. 
 Don't do this. Please. 
 Go. 
 Let 'em through. 
 Attention, citizens. 
 Please slowly move toward the main gate. 
 Please slowly move toward the main gate. 
 Attention, citizens. 
 Please slowly move toward the main gate. 
 Look.
