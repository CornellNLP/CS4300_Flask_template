 Previously on Colony... 
 I did some research, and there's all kinds of specialized equipment at USC and up on Mount Wilson. 
 But it doesn't matter because we're locked in here. 
 What if we aren't? 
 They found a tunnel under an old DWP substation that leads right into downtown. 
 We can exploit this, set a trap for whoever's using the tunnel. 
 I know what you're going through. 
 I have a daughter. 
 She matters more to me than anything. 
 This is a special book. 
 It has all kinds of secrets in it. 
 Your son Charlie is alive. 
 Those assholes were close enough to take a picture of my son, and we still don't have him home. 
 How long you been spying on me, lying to me, selling me out to those killers you work for? 
 I did it to protect you. 
 Bullshit! You did it for you. 
 You could fight with us. 
 We could fight together so that our kids don't grow up in this. 
 Train is inbound.
