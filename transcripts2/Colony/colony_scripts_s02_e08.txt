 Previously on "Colony"... 
 We successfully captured a key Red Hand operative. 
 Yet before we could extract any useful intelligence... No, no, come on. 
 She managed to kill herself while in our custody. 
 Come on. What is it? 
 It's our chance to change everything. 
 A sensitive file was downloaded from my office computer. 
 The other information on that flash drive, it matched something else we've been working on. 
 This isn't a colony. 
 It's a death camp. 
 Proxy Alcala is here, ma'am. 
 You're late. My apologies. 
 The traffic. 
 Proxy Fleming, Proxy Lee, what did I miss? 
 Helena was just bringing us up to date on last night's explosion. 
 It was an automated transport ship. 
 None of our Hosts were harmed. 
 Can we say that this was an act of sabotage? 
 Yes, and since virtually all of the supplies on the ship passed through our processing and labor camps... 
 It's not our fault. They can't possibly blame us. 
 They have blamed us for less. 
 In the meantime, we need to continue to do our jobs, which is to maintain order in this Colony. 
 That's what I wanted to talk about. 
 Everyone in my bloc saw the explosion, and I'm sure the Resistance will try to claim it for propaganda purposes. 
 I suggest we get ahead of it. 
 The Greatest Day is gaining real momentum in my bloc. 
 With the right spin, the public will believe that this event was intentional. 
 We can't push this Greatest Day thing too hard. 
 The people still need to respect the civilian authority. 
 It would be a mistake to let a crisis go to waste. 
 The nature of their response is out of our hands. 
 Let's just ensure that any decisions we make now won't come back to haunt us. 
 Understand? 
 Of course. 
 My fellow citizens, we all saw something... remarkable last night. 
 Now, I know that there are a lot of rumors going around our bloc. 
 What you witnessed... was the test of a technology that you have never seen before, one capable of inter-dimensional travel. 
 All in preparation for the Greatest Day. 
 I understand the hardships that all of you... 
 Asshole. 
 They're holding for you. 
 This is the Governor-General. 
 Have they decided on a response? 
 Ohh. Oh, no, no. 
 Damn it. 
 Yeah. 
 What happened? 
 Someone left a loose end at the safe house yesterday. 
 Once again, I find myself asking how this could have happened. 
 Once we secured the perimeter, the cordon moved inside. 
 No one was covering the back. 
 This Red Hand is a dangerous group of anarchists, part of a toxic ideology that threatens order in our bloc. 
 The more they continue to propagate, the more impotent we're going to appear. 
 Do we know where this kid is? 
 The surveillance pool is working overtime. 
 Every eye we have is looking for Mr. Emmett Hallstead. 
 Give me one day, Mr. Bennett, without anything getting in my way, and I will bring him in. 
 I've already seen what this partnership is capable of together. 
 I want to see how you operate on your own. 
 Detective Burke, you will oversee the surveillance operation as we look for Mr. Hallstead. 
 Detective Bowman, you will return to the safe house and find whatever it is you missed the first time around. 
 Why am I the one being sidelined? There is no sideline. 
 I'm just waiting for one of you to do something useful. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 You make any progress on that file? Yeah. 
 I feel like I'm putting together slides for the most depressing TED Talk ever. 
 "So You're Going Extinct." 
 It's a powerful message. 
 Should inspire more people to join the fight. 
 It worked on me. 
 Well, does that mean you're gonna be moving into our lovely little flat? 
 Will's in trouble. 
 His team raided one of the Red Hand's safe houses. 
 Will found a kid hiding inside, helped him escape. 
 But now they're out looking for the kid. 
 All right, so let me get this right. 
 You sabotage our operation with the the RAP and quit the group, yet when you need help, we're supposed to pretend it didn't happen? 
 I am the reason you escaped the Occupation. 
 And I helped you with BB. 
 Yeah, that worked great. 
 We'll go to Hennessey and tell him about the kid. 
 Whoa. Why are you taking the gauntlet? 
 Hennessey's gonna hold onto it. 
 Who decided that? I did. 
 Don't you think we should talk about this? 
 We're under a lot of heat, and it's not doing any good sitting in a box down here. 
 That's the only thing we have. 
 We've been... It's the right play. 
 There's a load down in sectors 1-5. 
 Repeat: a load down in sectors 1-5. 
 Show me. 
 Clean it up. 
 Not a trace. Yes, sir. 
 Do you remember when my... my mum came to visit? 
 Yeah. 
 I think I traumatized her by taking her to that Ethiopian place. 
 She liked you, you know. 
 She... always wondered why we... we couldn't make it work. 
 I, uh, have to show you something. 
 Where did you get this? 
 They're posted all over the city. 
 Did you call this number? 
 I did. 
 They have her. 
 I... wait. Your mother's in England. 
 I thought your mother was in England. Yeah, they... they work for some intelligence unit outside the Colony. 
 Oh, Jesus, Simon. 
 This is our chance to get out. 
 We didn't sign up for this. 
 We'll just... we'll just say we got in too deep, that we didn't know what we were doing. 
 You really think they'll buy that? 
 All they want is the gauntlet. 
 That's why we have to act now before Hennessey goes and does something with it. 
 Morgan, we have to cut our losses. 
 How can... how can we trust them? 
 Well, if we stay in this bloc, we're dead anyway. 
 Okay. 
 What do we have to do? 
 We need to give them Broussard. 
 I have to say, Mr. Bowman, I didn't think you had it in you. 
 I'm curious whether when you stole my keycard to help your attractive, fanatical girlfriend you thought about the consequences to not only yourself but every other person in this place. 
 Today I'm not the prison warden who's gonna threaten you with punishment. 
 Today I'm just a fellow inmate. 
 And I'm telling you... that you just signed your own death warrant... and mine... and every other soul in this camp. 
 Because the RAPs do not care who wears what uniform down here. 
 When something like this happens, we all burn. 
 Unless, of course, it never happened. 
 If there's no evidence at all that your friend's little gunpowder plot originated here, then it didn't happen. 
 And if it didn't happen, then maybe we all get to live another day. 
 Of course, that would mean that there can be no contradicting evidence left behind, anything or anyone that could upset the delicate narrative that you and I are establishing. 
 Which means that I need you... to provide me with names. 
 So you can have more people killed? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Was I, in my state of utter distress, babbling in tongues? 
 Your friends are already dead! 
 This is damage control. 
 Either some of us die, or all of us do. 
 You get the honor of deciding which one of those it's going to be. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Are you with the police? 
 Who are you? 
 My... my... my name is... 
 ... is Karen. 
 I'm Karen Brun. 
 I heard that my daughter might be living here, and I was just trying to find out where she might be. 
 What's your daughter's name? 
 Francine, but she goes by Frankie. 
 Do you know her? Do you know where she is? 
 Please, I haven't... she left home. 
 I haven't... I mean, I haven't heard from her in months, and... but then one of her friends... said that he heard that she was here, but the blood and the bullets... if you know where she is, please just tell me. 
 Your daughter was in the Resistance. 
 And... 
 I'm sorry. She didn't make it. 
 Oh, my God. 
 She's dead. 
 I wanted to know where she was. 
 I... I thought that I did. 
 I was separated from my son during the invasion. 
 He was gone for over a year. 
 Not knowing was... I should've... 
 I should've kept her closer. 
 It's not your fault. 
 She got involved with a powerful cult. 
 No. Cults prey on the weak. 
 And my daughter was strong. 
 You're right. She was. 
 Were... were you there when... 
 I have to know. 
 If someone could have told you about your son, even if the news was terrible, wouldn't you have wanted to know? 
 I tried to save her. You tried to save her? 
 You tried. 
 The RAPs don't even have to kill us anymore, because we're all down here lining up to do their work for them. 
 And now I'm gonna go to the factory, just for being Frankie's mother, because that's what you people do. 
 Not all of us. 
 Oh, my God. 
 This place is a dead end. 
 Take me back to HQ. Yes, sir. 
 Hey. This is Hennessey. 
 Katie, the one I told you about. 
 Always happy to meet a member of the extended family. 
 Is that the thing? 
 I will take good care of it. 
 What's this? Doomsday clock. 
 It's an analysis of classified census data from around the colony. 
 A little over 27 months from now, the population in the city will be reduced to 2.5% 
 These... were strewn all over the bloc, this morning. 
 _ 
 Is that even possible? 
 Maybe, maybe not. 
 Either way, you've got to admire the balls on 'em. 
 Are you in touch with them? 
 Not for lack of trying. 
 The Occupation is looking for one of their gophers. 
 We could warn them. It might be a way in. 
 And why are we suddenly so eager to find an in? 
 Her husband, Will. 
 The collaborator. 
 He let a kid go during a raid. 
 The Occupation sniffed it out. 
 They find the kid and break him, it'll be bad for Will. 
 I just don't see why that would be bad for me. 
 No offense. 
 My husband has been valuable to the cause. 
 Refuse to help him and you're cutting off one of your best sources inside the Occupation. 
 The name of the kid who escaped the safe house is Emmett Hallstead. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because he came here last night asking me for help. 
 He didn't go back to the Red Hand? 
 They're the ones he's running from. He's terrified of them. 
 Says they're gonna kill him just to tie up loose ends. 
 Yeah, shades of ISIS, man. 
 I put him in a safe house until things cool down. 
 Whether or not he stays put... 
 You have all been very stupid. 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you doing? Ungag him. 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 Augh, ahh, wait. 
 Wait. Wait a minute. Stop. I was lying. 
 I was lying. I was lying. 
 You wanted names, so I gave you names, okay? 
 That's what I've been wondering. 
 Should I really trust this kid? 
 Or is he using my empathy against me? 
 I'm not playing a game, Bram. 
 My life is at stake. 
 Lots of lives are at stake, so I need the truth. 
 All of it. 
 No, don't, don't, don't. He didn't do anything. 
 I swear to God he didn't do anything. Please don't. 
 Ohh. 
 Was anyone else involved? No. 
 You've just been lying to me. Why should I believe you now? 
 I want to go home. 
 You're a loose end. 
 Was anyone else involved? 
 No! 
 Let him go. 
 The kids in that dumpster, we killed them, you and me. 
 But we did it so that everyone else can live. 
 The way you can honor their sacrifice is by keeping your mouth shut. 
 Forever.

 Welcome, friends. 
 We gather here to celebrate another passing day, and with it one more step... 
 ... on our journey. Please stop that, Charlie. 
 The time has come to make preparations, to set aside earthly concerns and give ourselves over... 
 Charlie, stop it. 
 The Greatest day will be upon us and we who have been enlightened, who honor our Hosts with our patience and obedience... will be lifted up into their glory. This is a sacred place. 
 No, it's not. 
 You know, if you actually paid attention for once, you might learn something. 
 I don't want to learn this stuff; it's stupid. 
 All I have to do is tell one of the elders that I've been looking after a boy who is violent, destructive, and completely without remorse, and that I have identified him as a candidate for focused restoration. 
 And in just a few seconds, they will pull you out of sight, and you will never see your family again. 
 Is that what you want, Charlie? 
 
 
 
 Good. 
 And is now nearly upon us, but only... 
 Sir, found him. 
 This is Westlake and 6th looking north from 6:21 A.M. this morning. 
 In position. You're clear. 
 Who's there? 
 Your friend Hennessey wants me to move you. 
 Who are you? My name is Elise. 
 And you're not safe here. 
 No sh1t, lady. I'm here to help. 
 I have him. Wait. Who is that? 
 That's just my backup, sweetheart. 
 I'm not going anywhere unless I speak to Hennessey. 
 The Occupation is looking for you, and we don't have time. sh1t. 
 I can't go out there. 
 Why didn't you just go back to your cell? 
 I was the only one who escaped that raid. 
 They'd never believe that I didn't talk. 
 They'll kill me just to make sure. 
 Katie, we've got company. Who? 
 Redhats. 
 How long do I have? You don't. 
 They're surrounding the building. 
 Abort, Katie. 
 Hey, wait. 
 Katie, you need to get out of there right now. 
 Damn it. 
 Check your safety. Let's go! 
 You two, left. You two, right. 
 Come on! 
 Tell me where you are. You two, left. You two, right. Go! 
 Katie, talk to me. 
 Katie, talk to me. 
 Katie, you hear me? 
 Get to the east side of the building, where we came in. 
 Okay, listen to me. 
 There is a fire escape. 
 Meet me... 
 Sir, we got him. Let's go! Move! 
 Get off of me. Shut up! 
 Let's go! 
 Let go of me. I didn't do anything. 
 Uh-huh. Right. 
 Keep moving! 
 Get in there. Get in! 
 Governor-General, always good to see you. 
 Proxy Alcala talk to you, hmm? 
 Get in the car. Excuse me? 
 There's a meeting back at the Colony. I'll explain along the way. 
 If this is about the incident last night, I assure you it didn't come from my camp. 
 You're welcome to search the grounds. 
 We don't have anything to hide here. It's already been decided. 
 I took care of everything. 
 The Hosts could scan this camp themselves. 
 They wouldn't find anything. It doesn't matter, Alan. 
 You need to get in the car. 
 I'm not getting in the car. 
 I'm trying to save your life. 
 Now get in the car. 
 Let's go. 
 Wait. Wait. 
 Six-one-four-nine. Let's go. 
 Go, go, go, come on. 
 Get off me. What are you doing? 
 Come on. What's going on? 
 Get in. 
 Where are you taking me? 
 Look at that. I didn't even need the whole day. 
 Like I said, I was just a spotter. 
 I'll tell you whatever. 
 Please, you just have to protect me. 
 Protect you from whom? Them. 
 They'll kill me if they know I've even talked to you. 
 They won't touch you inside here, son. 
 You have my word on that. 
 So you won't send me to the Factory? 
 That depends on how much you can help me. 
 What do you want to know? 
 How did you escape the safe house? 
 I hid in a crawl space. 
 They never searched it. 
 Who recruited you? 
 Frankie. Frankie Brun? 
 How did she recruit you? 
 She said she loved me. 
 I'd never been with a girl before. 
 Did you ever have contact with the leader of the cell? 
 Yes. Who is he? 
 She. 
 Her name is Karen. 
 Frankie's mother. 
 He's outside. 
 Augh! 
 Ugh! 
 Hey. 
 They found the kid. Yeah, I know. 
 He didn't give me up in the first interview. 
 They're gonna torture him. 
 I tried, Will. 
 I had him in my hands, and he ran. 
 He was so young. 
 To be habitable for humans, a planet must have three things. 
 What's the first one? Water. 
 Excellent, goes there. 
 And what is the second... the second answer? 
 Oxygen. Very good. 
 And the third? 
 Sunlight. Good job, Gracie. 
 All right, let's move on to question number two. 
 "Astronomers estimate that there are 8.8 billion 
 "habitable planets..." 
 What's wrong, Charlie? 
 Finish your assignment, please, Gracie. 
 Come on. We have to go now. 
 Wait. What? Hey, get... Charlie, get back here. 
 Gracie, you are not done with your lesson. 
 I'm serious. 
 I will not tolerate... 
 Come on, let's go! 
 Get Gracie. Yeah. 
 I'll put her to bed. 
 We gotta go! 
 Will. 
 Will. 
 Charlie, Gracie. 
 Oh, God. 
 What happened? 
 Where are they? They've been relocated. 
 He never listened to you. 
 Not many people could have done that. 
 I owe you. 
 I want to learn. 
 We're going to live here? 
 Just for a little while. 
 It's not so bad. 
 We'll decorate, and we'll make it a home. 
 Okay. 
 Welcome home. 
 Don't blame me. 
 I told you what was gonna happen, and then it happened. 
 They killed everyone. 
 Yeah. 
 You work for them. 
 So does your father. 
 So does everyone who is holding out hope that someday things will be different. 
 You survived. 
 Don't forget why. 
 Give my best to your dad. 
 Bram. 
 Thank God. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 You're home.
