 Previously on Colony... 
 We have Intel that a VIP is coming into the block from some big meeting-- someone way bigger than Snyder. 
 The guy that had a gun on you in the Yonk? 
 There's a decent chance that you've at least seen his face. 
 You've been looking for a leak in your department. 
 Who is this? 
 Someone who knows the source is your wife. 
 Redhats. Redhats! 
 It's blown. 
 Go, go, Rachel, go! 
 [screaming and gunshots] 
 Let's go, guys! 
 Opportunity will come again, and when it does, I want you there with me. 
 This is why we fight. 
 [low chatter in Korean] 
 [sentimental music] 
 [sentimental music] [crying] ♪ ♪ [police sirens approach] Let's go. Clear this street and return to your homes. [suspenseful music] You have 60 seconds to disperse. Return to your homes! I said move! Everyone back up and go home! This is an unauthorized gathering. Get off the street. Don't point that thing at me, man. Look, back up. Traitor! Ugh! [overlapping shouting] Jae! Hey, Jae, hey! Get back! Back up! Shut up! Pa! Papa! [overlapping shouting] Jae! Papa, Papa! [father shouting] Papa! Jae! Papa! Jae! [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] [background chatter] Damn. I heard there was an even bigger riot in K-town. I was at work when they came... the other side of the city. Katie was at the bar. Back it up, back it up. Fought my way across town, but it took me hours. Radio chatter was flying about guys in the Bureau being taken out-- disappearing. So I knew I couldn't go back to my house 'cause someone from the invasion might be waiting for me there. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ The mob stayed quiet longer than I thought, but the wheels are spinning now. This whole damn place is going to hell. We were waiting for opportunity to knock. Well, here it is. You think this is enough to sell Snyder on our story? I think after this, he'll eat it right out of our hands. [ominous music] I specifically tripled last night's Homeland Security detail to avoid this. What the hell happened? There were a lot of people on the street before curfew last night, mostly in peaceful recognition of the anniversary. There was some looting, a few protests that turned violent, but most of the violence appears to have been spontaneous and random. Most, but not all. There were four or five incidents that may have been coordinated. Proxy, can we talk to you in private? [background chatter] [phones ringing] Why all the secrecy? [clears throat] We think a new cell might have set up operations outside the colony. That's not possible. We have a reliable CI that says it is. His cousin signed up with someone offering cash and weapons to anyone willing to fight the Occupation in the LA bloc. He said he went to meet a guy at the old Commerce building downtown. Downtown? How would they get in and out? Maybe someone found a way under the wall that the RAPs never sealed. What's important here is it looks like someone's invested in making you look bad. The scarier attacks from last night were all well-orchestrated, but then everyone vanished without a trace. It's like when the Taliban was hiding out in Pakistan. Nobody had the balls to cross the border and go after them. Everyone looked the other way, so they had safe haven. Let's say for a moment that I was interested in exploring this. Let us take a run through the wall into downtown, check it out. All right. Do it. Lagarza's unit will come with you. I can't send my two star investigators out there alone. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ The natives are restless. So am I. I've been leaving you messages for a week. Why haven't you answered me? My mother died the night of the Arrival. She'd had a bad heart for years. Shock did her in. I was angry, too, but if I'd acted on pure emotion, I'd be dead now. Are you accusing me of being too emotional? They hanged our friend and her sons from a bridge. I was giving you the space to deal with your anger so you could process it and then... get past it. I don't want to get past it. You've chosen to bury your emotions-- that's fine. I don't have to be like you to do this job. [somber music] ♪ ♪ [sniffles] Everything okay, Maddie? Uh... this painting my husband and I bought... before all this. It was confiscated after the Arrival. [scoffs, sniffles] I hated Nagle... [chuckles] but Rob loved him. We were at an auction, and... he just started bidding. [laughs] He hung it in the living room, and I had to see that thing every day. And you came around to like it. [tearful laugh] Yeah. Oh, sorry. Maddie. I need your help in here. The gallery showing went late last night, and I didn't have the kitchen staff to cover it. You want me to clean your kitchen? Is that a problem? I'll just call down to staffing and have them send someone else up. No, no, it's fine. I'm happy to take care of it. [water running] [Redhat radio chatter] Hold it right there. Give me your ID. [Redhat radio chatter] [device beeps] To think, after all this time, all we had to do was ask. Priority clearance. Don't jinx this. There's still a lot of road ahead. Let 'em through. [Redhat radio chatter] Let's go. [indistinct voice on PA] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [somber music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] [knocking at door] [knocking continues] Alan, what's going on? How you doing, Nolan? I'm good. Did you know the Chief Minister is coming to LA for some state of the union thing? Yeah, I heard about that. Thursday. Uh-huh. They didn't invite you? No. It's above my pay-grade, I think. [chuckles] Huh. There's some proposal that's gone to Helena's office to take over the bloc with a "new direction"? You've heard nothing about this proposal. No one approached you? Mm-mm, no. Nobody, nothing. I find that hard to believe. No one in the Green Zone makes a bowel movement without you knowing. Alan, I-I promise, this is the first I heard of this. Don't forget who gave you that cozy office of yours. I want a copy of that proposal. I'll start digging, but Alan... truly, as far as I know, everybody up here is fully behind you. With daggers in hand. [distant chatter] [tense music] ♪ ♪ What happened to the knock? We've got a protocol for a reason. It's just us. Open the door. Hello. This is Morgan and BB. You know Eckhart. This is Katie. This is your partner? What's your, uh, combat experience? 17 years of motherhood and 10 years of running my own business. Is that a serious answer? She's my partner. That's all you need to know. Just being cautious. Look, I'm the most cautious man you've ever met, and I trust Katie with my life. So can you. So here's the rundown. Our friends here got intel on a VIP coming into the bloc from outside the colony, someone major in regional leadership. They use the metro line to bring certain VIPs in and out of the colony. I thought all the metros were shut down. The target's supposed to come into the colony in two days. We know which MTA line he'll be on, but we don't know which station he's headed to. Why don't you three scout Wilshire and Vermont? We'll check out MacArthur Park Station. [footsteps approach] Good job. Look, I don't want to draw this out, so I'm just gonna say it. You invited me into your home, and you trusted me. I obviously violated that trust. You did. I'm sure I can contribute more if I was just put in a position to. Did you know the Mandels? No. Not many people in the LA art community did. They lived very simply, and they didn't run in our social circles. But they loved their art. They sunk every dollar they earned into it, and they had great taste. Their collection isn't in any of your catalogues. Very few people know it even exists... but I do because I helped them track a lot of it down. [sirens thrumming] Move to your assigned positions-- move, move! Secure the east entrance! Fall in. Maybe we'd better start clearing floors. We'll take the even numbers. [tense music] [labored breathing] ♪ ♪ Wow. Yeah. So that's where they all went. Well, I'll be damned. [solemn music] ♪ ♪ Oh, man. We're gonna need mules if we want to get to Big Bear. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ You want to be the good guy or the bad guy? Bad guys. [cocks trigger] Okay, make sure you miss. Go! Taking fire on the top floor. We need backup now! [Redhat radio chatter] What happened? They took the back stairwell. How many? Two shooters. Lost them. Tac 5 and 6, two shooters went down the southeast stairwell. Give pursuit. Roger that, sir. We're headed to street level. They were working on something. Let's have a look around. ♪ ♪ Check this out. Bingo. ♪ ♪ [office chatter] [knocking] You got something? Yeah, shot at. At least two of the insurgents were operating out of the top floor of the building. Where are they? They got clear. We found this. These were the locations of four of the largest "Zero Day" attacks. This means they were coordinated, and our CI's intel was good. And he was right about something else too. I sent Homeland's engineer corps out to look for any weak spots in the Wall. They found a tunnel under an old DWP substation that leads right into downtown. That must be how they were getting in and out undetected. We're gonna shut it down. No, don't do that. We can exploit this. Set a trap for whoever's using the tunnel. Redhats everywhere. This is great. Great? Is that your GI Joe gallows humor, like, "Ha ha, we're all gonna die"? It means your intel is good. If the Redhats are guarding the station, it means they're using it for something. What's better is we figured out the time their shift changes. So we can hit them while they're changing personnel. Okay. How did you guys get this intel? That's proprietary. No. This is either a partnership or it isn't. And if it is, then it's full disclosure in both directions, and if it's not, then this isn't for us. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Okay, what's that? It was going to be the subject of a billion-dollar market valuation. It's a micro-UAV. Avionics, hardware, software. That's one of two working prototypes. Another just like it flew into Homeland Security HQ a few months ago. It landed in the office of a high-ranking collaborator. Here, I, uh, I edited the files down. Confirmation on "Hyperion's" arrival from the Authority. [static] The purple line from downtown in two-- He's arriving during curfew... [static] Battery died a couple of weeks ago, but they picked up a bunch of other intel that back this up. Who's "Hyperion"? Apparently, he's a big F-ing deal. All right, the plan, therefore, would be to hit the metro and abduct him at the MacArthur Park station. Judging by security presence, it looks like Wilshire and Vermont is the final destination. But we want to hit the train further upstream, here in the tunnel before it enters MacArthur Park station. We come in through this egress hatch, plant the charge and wait around the corner. After the charge goes, they'll be scrambling. We can grab the VIP and bring him out through the tunnels. And then bring him back here for safekeeping. Sorry, we're blowing up a train? No, we're just gonna nudge it off the tracks. Newton's first law does the rest. Back there. Just straight through. Thanks. That one goes into the office. Mm-hmm. You don't find a Gauguin in a two-bedroom apartment every day, do you? This was an unbelievable source, Maddie. Thank you for bringing it to me. Put that one down there. I'll make sure the Gauguin doesn't get logged in. I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah, right there. With all the new work ahead, I'm going to be needing an assistant curator. [rock music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ so tell your thoughts to quiet down ♪ 
♪ push aside the hazy shroud ♪ 
♪ try and make your parents proud ♪ ♪ pretty as a wedding gown ♪ ♪ just hold ♪ [gunshots through silencer] ♪ the ones you love ♪ Bring a weapon to your eye, not your eye to the weapon. Good. It's headshot or bust. Their body armor will absorb anything else. If you get in close, remember the soft targets-- under the arm, neck and throat, and the thigh. Okay. Seems simple enough. It's not. [goggles clatter on table] This isn't about being able to make a split-second decision to defend your husband's life. It's about being able to walk up to a complete stranger and kill him. That's why you have to put your emotions aside. I don't want another lecture on compartmentalization right now. [muffled cheers and applause] A long time ago, I made decisions that meant I was gonna go through life alone... but I didn't have anybody standing at the threshold to warn me. You do, and I'm telling you... the road you're heading down is going to change you. There's no coming back from it. I know. 
 
 [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ain't nobody gonna tell me ♪ That guy's money's no good here. Thank you. When did you get here? ♪ I keep my left hand ♪ Remember back when we lived in that stucco box at Fort Hood? How we talked about getting a ranch up in the mountains, leaving the grid, living out in nature? Hunting, fishing. I think I remember you promising me my own horse. You ever think about that anymore? The mountains? Hm. Yeah, I think everybody in this city fantasizes about escaping now. Would you really do it? If it meant we could be together again? All the kids, you and me? What's going on, Will? I just really want to know if you'd leave all of this behind if it meant we could get back to the way things were. Of course I would. I'd do anything for that. [song continues] [song ends] [cheers and applause] [Redhat radio chatter] If what Snyder said is true, this is a better exit plan than going back through the Wall with Lagarza. Why didn't the RAPs find this tunnel? Because they ain't perfect. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [creaking, rumbling] Jesus. We're under the damn Wall. You ever take a moment and thank God that you know me? Given how many times you've tried to send me to meet him, no. I haven't gotten around to it. [chuckles] [rumbling, creaking continues] Watch your step, sir. [Redhat radio chatter] Alan? What's this all about? Hey, Nolan, how you doing? Uh, all right. Gallery's in here, right? Yeah. Yes, sir. I truly admire the work your wife is doing, by the way. The collection is really growing. Hit the private office first. I want to see all the art they've been keeping in there. Sir. You want to tell me what the hell's going on? In this world, loyalty and trust are such critical qualities. Hey, what are you doing? Don't touch those. Back away, please, ma'am. What I need to know is how far can I trust you? Please, ma'am, stay out of our way. What are you doing in my house? Oh, we're admiring your collection. [whistles] I don't need an art history degree to know that that's a really expensive painting. There are more in the office, sir. I had no idea that was here. This is the sort of thing that should be up with our Hosts, isn't it? Yes, of course. Of course it is. There, her. She's the one that brought it to me. She the one that you want. Talk to her. [dramatic music] Who are you? I'm just an assistant. ♪ ♪ This way, please, ma'am. No. What are you doing? Come with me. This is my house! I think... Get your hands off of me. I think that we have a certain level of trust, so I'll believe you if you tell me that this was your wife's mistake and not yours. I knew nothing about this. Do something, Nolan! I didn't think so. Nolan! Let's go! You bitch! Okay, ma'am. [plastic handcuffs squeak] Get your hands off of me. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [background chatter] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ You going camping? Just taking inventory. It's good to be ready. Yes, it is. Bram, I have to go out tonight. To the Yonk? I got Johnnie to cover. Where are you going? I have to do something for the family. What? I want to know what's going on. No, of course, that would involve actually explaining something to me. I will tell you everything-- I promise you. I can't do it now. I need you to watch Gracie tonight. I have plans. Break them. I always have to watch her. I'm not her parent. You and Dad are. You do it. Bram. Look at me. This is important. If there's an emergency, you can call me on that number, but this is just between you and me. Do you understand me? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Hey, bear. Are you mad at Bram? No, we just had a disagreement. About Charlie? Charlie? No. Because he's going to be okay. I know he is. All the kids are. We're their favorites. They need us. Who? What are you reading? Nothing. Grace Kathryn. I can't tell you. Let me see. [suspenseful music] Mom! Mom... Mom, please. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Lindsey give this to you? Mom, give it back. Give me back my book, Mom! Hey. Mom, this is mine! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Give it back. I would like you to go up to your room right now and compose yourself. Excuse me, go. What happened? That's what Lindsey's been teaching your sister. [door slams] Holy sh1t. Yeah. Don't ever believe anybody who tells you that what we're dealing with here is benign. [beeping] Hey. What's wrong? Lindsey-- you know what she's been doing? You know what they've been teaching our daughter? Indoctrination. Right here in our house, and both of us too blind to see it. Our daughter is worshipping the RAPs. Do you not care? Yes, I care. But we don't have to worry about that anymore. We're leaving the colony. What? You, Maddie, and the kids are gonna go with Beau. He's got a cabin up in Big Bear. It's stocked, off the grid, safe. When were you gonna tell me about this plan? I'm telling you now. The window is now. And when we're up in Big Bear with Beau, where will you be? I'm gonna go and get Charlie and meet you there. [exhales] [laughs] This is funny? No, Will, it's crazy. When I came into the Yonk, you said that you would do this. I thought we were just talking. I didn't realize that you were serious. I'm the only one that's been serious about protecting this family. How can you say that? [sighs] How long you been spying on me? Lying to me? Selling me out to those killers you work for? I did it to protect you. Bullshit! You did it for you. You did it because you can never accept things the way they are. No, I did it because someone has to do something. You know what's going on out there? Someone has to say "enough." I should have shut you down the minute I found out what you were doing. Instead, I'm running around town trying to clean up after you. Thanks-- don't need your help. You'd be dead if it wasn't for me. So would you. Like Phyllis? You mean the person whose job it was to hunt down and destroy anyone brave enough to stand up? [scoffs] That how you justify it? I showed you what Broussard did, and you stayed with him anyway. I don't have to justify anything to you. Oh. You watched my friend Rachel get shot in the street like a dog. And then they hung her and her sons from a bridge. They were babies, Will. You think I don't know that? That is on you. What you are doing put a noose around those babies' necks. Maybe you should think about our kids. I am doing this for our kids! You don't care what I think. You just show up here with a plan expect me to follow orders. That's not a partnership, Will, and it's not a marriage. Don't you tell me what a marriage is. I was straight up with you, and you lied to my face. You lied to me when you went after Charlie. What would have happened if you hadn't come home? We would never have known what happened to you. Will, I hate myself for this. I hate myself every day. I hate what it's done to us. I hate what it's done to our family. But I know you hate the Authority as much as I do. You could fight with us. We have something new-- something big. We're gonna finally get a look inside the Occupation and see what it is that we're facing. We could fight together so that our kids don't grow up in this. [dramatic music] And you thought my plan was crazy. ♪ ♪ You need to get the kids and go with Beau. And do what? Hide? There's no hiding from them, Will, not even outside the Walls.

Okay, no biggie. We'll wait for another opportunity to come along. There won't be another opportunity. We got the go-ahead from Snyder. The tunnel's still open. You should use it. I don't know what's gonna happen here, but... I don't want you taking the hit for it. Get out while you can. [scoffs] Doesn't matter what a man has if he doesn't have purpose. You take that away from him... man usually goes with it. [somber music] ♪ ♪ To tell you the truth-- [laughs softly] I never thought I'd find mine again. Watch your six, brother. Always.

Are you sure? We're set. Get around the corner. [train clanking on tracks] It's coming into the kill-zone. [rumbling approaches] [screeching brakes] [rumbling echoes] Holy sh1t!
