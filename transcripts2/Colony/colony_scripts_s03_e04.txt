 Previously on "Colony"... 
 You're done when the job is done. 
 Do not turn this on again until you have eyes on the missing host. 
 Good morning. 
 I'm Andrew MacGregor. 
 I, uh, run this place. 
 I'd like you to write down everything that you learned in Los Angeles. 
 Children go to school. Adults work. 
 And then there are no electronics of any kind. 
 A RAP. It's online. 
 Your enemy is coming here. Yes. 
 And what will they do when they get here? 
 Total annihilation. 
 God. 
 My department was responsible for running analytics on the dark web. 
 Monitoring bot nets and arms dealers. 
 Nothing that specific. 
 We were trying to figure out the shape of this thing. 
 But that was a waste of time. It was just chaos. 
 And that's when you hired the kid. 
 Yeah. 
 Some hotshot who was supposed to get his feet wet in my department before he moved on to bigger things. 
 Then he got curious. Started tinkering. 
 It was all hidden in plain sight. 
 Extra data packets attached to everything that moved across the deep web. 
 What was in the packets? 
 No way to tell. It was totally encrypted. 
 The thing is, the volume of information was enormous. 
 Almost 40% of everything we were intercepting. 
 I brought it to my bosses. 
 Two days later, the kid dies in a traffic accident. 
 And then I get promoted to a different desk. 
 I'm not the most political guy, but even I got the picture. 
 We're going up against a vast intergovernmental conspiracy. 
 The most powerful people in the world are betraying the rest of us. 
 I got that from your website. 
 What I don't understand is, why are they doing this? 
 Aren't they already in charge? The kid... he tried to crack the codes on the encrypted packets, right? 
 Yeah. 
 But he ran into a brick wall. 
 He said it was like nothing he'd ever seen. 
 As if the code had been designed by an intelligence far greater than our own. 
 Think how easy our technology has made it to seize control of our planet. 
 Everything is online. 
 The controls to our power grids. 
 The way we communicate. 
 The most personal details of our private life. 
 It's all just sitting there, waiting to be exploited. 
 Exploited by who? 
 Not who. What. 
 You've done an important thing here. 
 The world is asleep on its feet. 
 We're gonna wake 'em up. 
 This can't trace back to me. 
 Trust me, I take every possible precaution. 
 _ 
 Remember to pick up Chris at practice tomorrow. 
 Right. 
 Working late again? 
 Yeah. 
 Gotta get the gift boxes ready for the holiday rush. 
 Okay. 
 Target acquired. FBI. 
 Stay down, Laura, it's okay. On the floor! 
 What the hell are you... 
 Do you work for them? 
 I've been going over all the evidence. 
 You're in a lot of trouble, Mr. MacGregor. 
 You just made your first big mistake. 
 You see, before, people thought I was just some crackpot on the internet. 
 But now, I've got a platform. 
 People will listen to me. 
 Why exactly do you think people will listen to an accused pedophile? 
 What? 
 Your little cabin back in the woods stuffed to the brim with child pornography that horrified even the most experienced agents. 
 You planted this. 
 You know, I feel badly for your wife. 
 And your children. 
 Who betrayed me? 
 Somebody smart enough to choose the right side of history. 
 What happened? 
 It's a machine. 
 Wait, who? The RAP? 
 Yeah. 
 That thing we saw in the crashed capsule near Big Bear. 
 It had guts, no wires. 
 Maybe that's what it was talking about. 
 Maybe that's one of its enemies. 
 The RAPs have enemies? 
 That's what it said. 
 You knew about this. 
 I heard rumors. 
 There were a lot of rumors at the IGA. 
 Most of them seemed like rationalizations. 
 Anyway, why did it matter to a bunch of people living in a cabin off the grid? 
 It matters now. 
 The captured RAP has said that they were being chased by something much worse. 
 That they were on the run just trying to defend themselves. 
 You heard that too. 
 It's time to start talking. 
 The RAPs said they would protect us if we gave them what they needed. 
 A slave labor force. 
 The Factory's main purpose is to build a defense grid. 
 That way, if the other side ever catches up to the RAPs, Earth won't be annihilated in the fight. 
 Wait, so the RAPs are saying that they're the good guys? 
 Do you believe it? 
 I don't know. 
 MacGregor shut down the interrogation before we could dig any deeper. 
 Why? We should be in there asking it everything. 
 You're right. 
 This is the best opportunity the human Resistance has ever had. 
 All of the answers are a few feet from us. 
 My unsolicited advice would be to tread very lightly in those waters. 
 MacGregor's a man who likes to be in charge of the narrative. 
 Seven, zero. 
 Copy that, Baker Five. 
 We'll rendezvous at those coordinates. 
 Over and out. 
 I don't like it. 
 You don't like anything. 
 Maybe the signal went down because the Occupation cracked the code. 
 We could be walking into a trap. 
 I know that guy's voice. 
 I've been talking to him for six months. 
 And you'd know if he had a gun pointed at his head? 
 We have to meet him. Why? 
 Because I need the camp's location. 
 Do you really think they just hand out that address? 
 Only a few people outside know where it is. 
 You lied. 
 No, I said I would take you to the camp, and I will. 
 This is just the procedure. 
 Maybe I was a little misleading. 
 But it's not like you're giving away all of your secrets either. 
 You ready? 
 The enemy. 
 Machines. All of 'em. 
 They conquered our cities. 
 They stole our lands. 
 They murdered our friends and families. 
 And last night, one of the enemy finally spoke. 
 Lies. 
 It claims it is our friend. 
 That they came to support us against another enemy that has yet to be seen. 
 Now the truth is, this Click is trying to exploit us. 
 It knows that humans are weak. 
 Most humans are. 
 But not the ones in this camp. 
 This thing speaks in contradictions. 
 We would drive ourselves mad trying to sift through it all. 
 But we are not gonna play its game. 
 So I lay our broken enemy at your feet. 
 Now we can continue to listen to its pathetic attempts to beg for whatever amounts to its life. 
 Or we can claim a true victory for the Resistance by destroying it. 
 Now, think for a moment the message that that will send. 
 We destroy a Click, and while they are still reeling from that loss, we deliver a devastating strike to the heart of the collaborationist military apparatus. 
 We demonstrate to the Clicks and their collaborators and every single Resistance cell on this planet that mankind will not go quietly. 
 Destroy it! 
 Destroy it! 
 Look for a bus. 
 Who are you? 
 Tania Two. 
 Three months ago you broke protocol and accidentally used a real name over the air. 
 What was it? 
 Lawrence. 
 Who's your friend? 
 He ran a cell in the LA bloc before it emptied. 
 Camp's never been down this long. I'm losing my sh1t. 
 What was their last transmission? 
 Uh, a package had arrived from Los Angeles. 
 Some alien tech. A gauntlet? 
 They say who brought it? Was it a family? 
 I don't know, man. Are they your friends? 
 I'm thinking we should disappear before they start rolling up our whole network. 
 Smart guy. 
 We need to get to the camp. 
 That's crazy. 
 What if it's been overrun by the Occupation? 
 We have critical information for them about some super-weapon the Occupation is building in Seattle. 
 I need the location. 
 I can't give the location to you without authorization, and that only comes from the camp. 
 I know I'm asking you to break protocol, but this is an emergency. 
 Don't you want to know what happened at the camp before you spend the rest of your life on the run? 
 Stay here. 
 Your man looks like he's gonna jump out of his skin. 
 You try living out here for two years with just a radio to keep you company. 
 Actually, you'd probably love that. 
 Make sure you get that fire going. 
 Hey. 
 What's up, Mom? 
 I gotta catch up on some sleep. 
 Okay. 
 Smart, that one. 
 Takes after me. 
 Commander wants to see you. 
 I built this place before the Arrival. 
 Bet this made for a nice mountain getaway back then. 
 Hmm. 
 I was picked up on some trumped-up charge, so I skipped bail and I dug in here. 
 The evidence against the Clicks was overwhelming, but some people would rather be blind than see. 
 Not us. 
 Hmm. 
 The reason that this camp has survived for so long is that the people who remain fall in line behind a singular vision. 
 Yours. 
 Revolutions aren't won by committee. 
 No, but they're won with smart strategy. 
 Which requires accurate intelligence gathering. 
 We have the enemy in our hands; I can't think of one reason why we wouldn't want to question it, find out more about what we're fighting. 
 Because every word that comes out of that thing's mouth is poison. 
 We'll never know what's true unless we keep asking it questions. 
 We have information that might corroborate what the Click was saying about the other species. 
 A ship crashed in the mountains in Northern California while we were making our way north. 
 I saw that in your notebook. 
 And your scout saw it too. 
 We stumbled upon an escape capsule. 
 I don't know what was inside, but it was not a machine. 
 I saw that in your notes too, but there is no corroboration. 
 Well, all of this lines up with other things that we know. 
 We've heard that the Clicks are using the Factory to build a huge defensive grid to shield themselves and us from whatever else is coming. 
 You see, I did not see that detail in your notes. 
 Do you expect me to just give you everything? 
 Yes. 
 Well, there's more. If we can work together. 
 I invited you both here this morning because I hoped that we could come to some kind of understanding. 
 But you must realize that I have provided food and shelter for both you and your children. 
 It's a taste of civilization. 
 If you care about the war you're fighting, then destroying that Click would be a huge mistake. 
 The people who stay here succeed because they understand that there is a line that must be towed. 
 Now, you would not be the first person to come here with a different philosophy. 
 That's absolutely fine. I can't tell you what to think. 
 But I can show you the door. 
 I got you. Ah, thanks. 
 Nice steady pour. 
 This barrel's almost full. Gotcha. 
 Tie it around twice. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 My dad sent me down to help you with the detail. 
 Then help with the fertilizer. 
 He's taking too long. 
 Give him a minute. 
 Why didn't he want us to listen to his conversation? 
 Because he's protecting his sources. 
 You would've done the same thing. 
 Here you go. Coordinates. 
 Thank you. 
 If camp finds out I gave it to you without authorization... 
 Hey, desperate times, desperate measures. 
 You going on foot? 
 You got a better idea? 
 Hey, do you think that they... Whoa. 
 Get out of here. What's going on? 
 Where were you guys? 
 MacGregor's. 
 How'd it go? Not well. 
 Where's the RAP? 
 Don't know, but MacGregor's got no interest in hearing another word from that thing. 
 You really think he's gonna destroy it? 
 Because that would be a really big problem. 
 How big? 
 We need to get out of this camp. 
 And go where? Anywhere, far from here. 
 MacGregor's just bluffing. 
 He's too smart to destroy the RAP. 
 Too smart is not my read on that man. 
 There's something else. 
 They're building a bomb. 
 A big one. 
 15, maybe 20 55-gallon drums loaded with fertilizer and diesel fuel. 
 Ammonium nitrate. 
 Same thing McVeigh used in Oklahoma City. 
 What are they putting it in? 
 Right now, just a couple of pickups, but they've got a lot of barrels. 
 Way more than the pickups could carry. 
 For a place so worried about staying hidden, they seem to be doing everything they can to get noticed. 
 I hate to repeat myself, but we need to leave. Now. 
 We don't even know if we can leave. 
 MacGregor doesn't trust us any more than we trust him at this point. 
 We need to go back to Vincent. 
 He cared enough about communicating with that RAP to disobey MacGregor and to come find us. 
 And he has people. 
 Yeah, we'll need him if this comes to a head. 
 Comes to a head? 
 What's the update? Nobody in or out. 
 The RAPs are still the enemy, right? 
 Even if they came here 'cause of some other war, they still killed tens... I don't know... hundreds of millions of people. 
 I know. 
 Sure wish this kind of thing was black and white. 
 It isn't. 
 Then who are we fighting? 
 Same enemy we've always been fighting. 
 The real war isn't against the RAPs. 
 Or whatever was in that capsule. 
 It's against ourselves. 
 Keep watch. 
 MacGregor has eyes everywhere. I shouldn't be seen with you. 
 But you risked it. 
 Because you know the same thing we do. 
 The Click is the most important asset the Resistance has ever captured. 
 It's insane to destroy it for no reason. 
 He won't actually destroy it. 
 That was just bluster. 
 His way of reclaiming the narrative. 
 So what's he doing with it? 
 
 
 
 I don't know. 
 I've been cut out. 
 You're the second in command. 
 Your arrival here has complicated our relationship. 
 You came for the gauntlet because you knew it was the best thing for the cause. 
 He doesn't think I've been loyal to him. 
 It's MacGregor's camp and his rules. 
 We all accepted that when we came here. 
 That's because we were trusting him to make his decisions with the good of the camp and the Resistance in mind. 
 What if he isn't? 
 People came here to fight a dictatorship, not sign up for another one. 
 I know. Then help us. 
 Do what? 
 Convince him not to destroy the Click. 
 Not until we figure out what it really knows. 
 I'll go talk to him. 
 Wait. 
 We need to talk. 
 Talk about what? 
 Back there. 
 How'd those guys get on us so fast? 
 He must've been right. 
 They were monitoring the radio. 
 That's one possibility. 
 What's your theory? 
 I'm thinking maybe you walked me into a trap. 
 You come through the wall with a superficial wound and a sad story, but I really don't know anything about you. 
 You haven't asked. 
 I'm asking now. 
 How dare you? 
 Like I've got something to prove to you. 
 Tell me why I'm wrong. 
 What's my grand plan? 
 If I wanted you dead I could've shot you in your sleep. 
 Maybe you wanted to lead the Occupation to the Resistance camp. 
 I'm the one who got us the coordinates. 
 You want an ironclad guarantee? 
 It's not gonna happen. 
 You need to decide... you either trust me or you don't. 
 Whoa, just hear me out. Move! 
 Just look... we owe it to this camp. 
 I said move. Back up! Look... Andrew! 
 This is a mistake! 
 It is not your call. 
 Take it to the trucks. 
 Do not forget the chain of command. 
 I am not discussing this again. 
 Just get back to work. 
 Come on, give me a hand. 
 They just hauled the RAP away. 
 Hey, where are you going? 
 Uh, the agriculture detail asked for a resupply. 
 Nah, I didn't hear anything about that. 
 It's a low priority, I guess. 
 They're waiting for me. 
 Go. 
 It's cold. 
 You really think this is a good idea? 
 Unless you got a better suggestion. 
 Maybe there's another bridge that's unguarded. 
 You really want to hike another 50 miles up and down the river to find out? 
 You're in good shape. 
 Just hang on to the raft and pace yourself. 
 As long as you keep moving your legs, you probably won't go hypothermic. 
 Probably? 
 I'm just guessing. 
 You're the doctor, aren't you? 
 How'd it go? 
 Where are they taking the Click? 
 MacGregor is sending him back to them. 
 He's putting it on a train and shipping it north. 
 Along with the bomb. 
 North where? 
 Seattle. 
 They're bombing a Colony? 
 MacGregor thinks it's a key target. 
 We've heard a lot of chatter. 
 Something big is happening there. 
 Innocent people live in Seattle. 
 I know. 
 Jesus, Vincent. 
 I wish you could've seen MacGregor at the beginning. 
 When everyone else was giving up hope, we believed in him. 
 That man is gone. 
 I know. 
 I've done things for him. Things I shouldn't have done. 
 You can't change the past. 
 But what's happening right now, you know it's wrong. 
 You can stop it. 
 What do you need? 
 Oh, sh1t. Fire! Fire! 
 You gotta move this truck! Come on! 
 Give it to me! 
 You gotta get us out now! 
 You guys, come on! 
 Here, take this. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 The other side. You got it. 
 He doesn't want to see you. 
 Go. 
 All clear. Oh, sh1t. 
 Drop your weapons now! 
 After everything? 
 Blowing up the Click is a mistake. 
 Well, that's not your decision. 
 Why not? 
 I helped capture it. 
 That's right, Vincent. You helped. 
 Because you're a follower, not a leader. 
 And now you're following these two. 
 Do you even know who they really are? 
 Don't let him get in your head. 
 Do you really believe all these stories? 
 How they magically stole the gauntlet from the Click? 
 How they were able to just walk right out of the bloc just before it was renditioned? 
 And how they know things that they could not possibly know? 
 For instance, today she told me that the Clicks are building fortifications in space. 
 That's something I intercepted with Broussard. 
 That's bullshit. 
 They're double agents, and here to undermine us. 
 Now, you have a decision to make, Vincent. 
 You are outnumbered. 
 Lower your weapon. 
 Unless you're willing to die for a couple of strangers. 
 Don't do it. 
 Take them to the brig. 
 What's that? 
 I found a crashed crate in the woods. 
 I think they're dropping those from planes. 
 The Occupation? 
 Get warm. 
 Shouldn't have accused you of walking me into a trap. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't realize you knew that word. 
 I just... 
 I've had some bad experiences. 
 Guy I followed after the Arrival turned out to be in it for himself. 
 One of my crew members tried to kill me. 
 You don't have to explain. 
 Just had to be sure. 
 So you trust me now? 
 Yeah. 
 I trust you too. 
 Damn it! 
 Oh, God. 
 No! 
 That's weird. 
 Be ready.
