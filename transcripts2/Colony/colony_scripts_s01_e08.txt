 Previously, on Colony... 
 This is amazing. Does it work? 
 Not unless I can find a high-quality lens. 
 I think I can get one for you. 
 Our cause needs all sorts of people, Katie. 
 It needs soldiers like Broussard who can pull the trigger, and it needs people like you. 
 What purpose do I serve other than spying on my husband? 
 Whatever you're going through, we're going through together. You can tell me anything. 
 He was a government hit man before he sold out to a military contractor. 
 Now he's a stone-cold killer. 
 Anything you can remember could help. 
 Yeah? 
 He's coming for you. 
 Hey, seen your neighbor today? 
 Nope. 
 What if you were passing information to the Resistance without even knowing it, being the trusting husband that you are? 
 I sent Carlos to the Factory. 
 Lots of decisions will always be made above our heads. 
 That's just how it is. [low background chatter] [somber music] [buzzer blares] ♪ ♪ [buzzer continues] ♪ ♪ [coughing] Please! It's just something in my throat! [coughing] There's just something in my throat! [sobs] I'm not sick! I'm not sick! I'm not sick! [buzzer blares three times] It's not gonna get any closer just 'cause you keep staring at it. What does it matter to you? Because every time I see your sad-ass face, I remember where I am. It's depressing. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] What? Nothing. Been staring at me all morning. Can't a man enjoy the sight of his beautiful wife without getting the third degree? Bram, what are you reading? Some stuff for school. Bram. Gracie. Your mom and I need to tell you something. Charlie's okay. Where is this? The government found him in the Santa Monica bloc. Who's he living with? We don't know. Is he coming home? That's the plan. That's the whole reason I went to work for the government. So we could get him back home. When are we gonna see him? I don't know. What do you know? I know I'm making progress. I'm gonna be out late tonight. Why? Where are you going? [sighs] I miss him. We all do, Bear. [somber music] Hey. What in the hell was that? They needed to know. You don't think that should have been a discussion? There's nothing to discuss. There shouldn't be any secrets in our house. Helena. What a pleasant surprise. Hello, Alan. Always good to see you, of course. Our meetings are just usually more... scheduled. Well, I wanted to let you know that the Chief Minister of the Pacific Coast is coming to our Colony for the anniversary of the Arrival. Here? Why? Is there going to be some kind of celebration? Not exactly, no. More like a performance review. Great. I welcome that. I think things are going very well here as of late. We're meeting all of our worker quotas. Since the Geronimo trial, we've had no significant insurrection. Except, of course, for your abduction attempt. A complete outlier which has been fully handled by my counter-insurgency team. I'm not the one you need to convince. Of course. I just want you to know that I stand behind my work. Tell me, Alan, do you think that anyone is afraid to do anything in your bloc? They gave us the power to govern our own way. Yes, but they also made it quite clear. We must maintain order. Well, I don't think that order comes from fear. It comes from providing people with a decent quality of life. Hmm. I admire the impulse, but remember what George Orwell said. What was that? "If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face... forever." Precisely my point. This situation is bad enough. We don't need to make it worse. All right, Alan. Look, I just came by to give you a heads-up. The Chief Minister will be here, and he will be reviewing everything that's going on around here, and you can explain your policies to him. Oh, and, uh, you should know. No one else is doing it your way. [tense music] Get the doors. They know everything? Pretty much. Not all the gory details, but what I'm doing, yeah. They're good at it. They like it. Which makes me a shitty parent, on some level. [both laughing] Yeah, I couldn't tell my kids. I mean, Gracie's too young, but... I couldn't put that burden on Bram. Not when Will doesn't know. That wouldn't be right. No, it wouldn't. Why'd you want to meet? What's going on? What if Broussard had followed Quayle's orders? My kids need a mother. I want out. Wow. I knew it was bad, but... Half the cell is dead or gone. Broussard is blown. Was it worth it? The price we paid? All those sacrifices. I feel like I let you down. No, no, this is not your fault. I should have done more about the Quayle situation. I'll go to him and tell him that you served your time, that he needs to leave you and your family alone, or I'm out, too. Thank you. [background chatter] Reliving your glory days? Man, I wish. Instead, I'm going through this stuff from Broussard's house looking for something that might help us. Got anything? Well, he started three years at linebacker, and his senior quote was Nietzsche. Not sure that's gonna help us find him. Jennifer told me to dig. So here I am, digging. [phone rings] Aren't you gonna answer it? First time it's rung since I took over the office. Bowman. You've been looking for a leak in your department. Who is this? Someone who knows the source is your wife. Do I have your attention? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Take a walk to Wilshire. Get on the next Red Line bus. Number 33. If I so much as sniff surveillance, I'm gone. [click, dial tone] What the hell was all that? Anonymous tip from our favorite cell. Probably just a crank. Probably. I'm gonna check it out anyway. You want some company? Don't want to waste your time. I sure as hell wouldn't worry about that. [deep bass engines thrum] Thank you for traveling with the Transitional Authority's Red Line from Westwood to Larchmont in 15 minutes, all day, every day. How's the gardening? [laughs] Well, that's our business, isn't it? Planting seeds, watering them, hoping they'll grow into something useful. That how you know my wife? I run her cell. You don't seem surprised. Broussard work for you? I know he's the guy you want, and I'm prepared to give him up. I've decided to make a deal, and you're gonna negotiate on my behalf. And why would I do that? Because you're invested. If you succeed, I'll disappear, and your wife's secret will disappear with me. If you fail, her name will be the first thing I spill under interrogation. People died for you, and you're just gonna sell 'em out? [softly] You know, you work for the Occupation. Do I really need to justify anything to you? Here are my terms. I'll roll on my cell, absent your wife, of course. In exchange, they will get me outside the bloc in downtown Los Angeles in a fully-stocked pickup truck. Why? What's outside the Walls? Pockets of survivors. The RAPs leave them alone. Here's my number. Call me when you're ready to deal. Next stop, Hauser. [background chatter] Is it really safe to meet here? There's a church around the corner. We're not meeting in a church. [scoffs] This is really conspicuous. All right. Walk with me. What can I do for you? So you're the guys who pulled the Snyder job? Let's say we were. I have a group of... skilled individuals who are trying to do the same thing as you. Uh-huh. Were you affiliated with Geronimo? No. Did you ever have any contact with him? How's that relevant? Because I heard that you were his tactical arm. We need someone who can handle those kinds of details. For an operation. What kind of operation? We have intel that a VIP is coming into the bloc for some big meeting, someone way bigger than Snyder. We've got a date, a location, and the means of transit. Who's your source? Let's just say that we have some proprietary technology. [tense music] What's that? It's our business plan. Business plan. Yeah. For the operation. We've done our due diligence. Want to take a walk? You bet. Gracias. Gracias. Damn, these  are  good! [chuckles] I'm telling you. Mmm. So... I'm guessing this is about that phone call. I think I might have found the source of our leak. Yeah? Who's that? Me. Interesting theory. The guy who called claims to be running Broussard's cell. He wants to come in. Cut a deal. And you're worried about who he might bring with him. Yeah. You know, I'm wondering what might happen if Broussard learned that someone was trying to sell him out. The cell might clean up their own mess. It's a dangerous game. [sighs] [suspenseful music] How's it going? Uneasy is the head that wears the crown, Will. Well, I've got some good news. Why do I find that hard to believe? A low-level operative in Broussard's cell just walked in the door. He's willing to roll on his crew. Names, locations, everything. And why, exactly, is this operative betraying his own cell? Because we broke them. He knows it's his last opportunity at leverage. What's this gonna cost me? He wants out of the bloc with a fully-supplied pickup truck. Outside the Wall? All right, I'm willing to consider an arrangement. But I want to meet him. Face to face. [scoffs] I don't think that's a good idea. I don't care. I can't afford another disaster, so this goes directly through me. Fine. [deep bass engines thrumming] I went by your house. It looked like a Redhat convention. How'd they find it? You know how. It's not her. Why'd you lie about knowing Geronimo? You kidding? That Geronimo sh1t was for the mob, not you. I thought you saw right through it. So what now? We do what we set out to do-- fight until they're gone. Hennessey put me in contact with another cell. They got solid intel on a big operation. A VIP is coming into the bloc from the outside. They have a comprehensive plan for the op. They just need our tactical expertise to pull it off. Let me know what you think. [low chatter in other room] I want to talk to you about this morning. It's not like you to do something like that without talking to me first. Gracie did not understand at all. She just kept asking, "If they know where Charlie is, why can't he come home?" They deserved to know. Maybe. I deserved to be a part of figuring out when and how to tell them. Okay. "Okay," what? Okay, I'll try and do better next time. What is going on with you today? We caught a big break at work. The head of their cell came in today. "Came in"? He wants to deal. I think he's spooked. He's willing to give up Broussard to save his own ass. Don't worry. This is a good thing. Once this guy rolls on his cell, we don't have to look over our shoulders anymore. That's great news. What? [sighs] It's just a lot. Yeah, I know. I'm glad you're home. I told Ben I'd cover the late shift tonight at the Yonk. Go for it. I'll hold down the fort. You've reached Bronson Construction. No one's available. Please leave a message. I have an emergency. It's my, uh, porch. I think the whole thing is about to fall down. [suspenseful music] 
 
 [grunts] Look at the Moon. The, uh, Sea of Smyth. Oh, my God. I know. I mean, that sure as hell wasn't there a year ago. Why is it so blurry? Did I get the wrong lens? No, your lens is decent. It just wasn't ground for the specific optics of this telescope. Well, what can we do? We need professional gear. We need infrared or a radio telescope. What do you think's up there? It's a base, a shipyard or a mine, and that's why we never see 'em. Because they live up there? Well, it's just conjecture until we can get a clearer look at whatever's going on. [background chatter] [rock music plays] We shouldn't be meeting. Especially not here. So? Quayle sold us out. Bullshit. It's coming straight from Will. Quayle's trying to cut a deal with the Occupation. Maybe Will is manipulating you. Excuse me? Maybe he suspects you. Maybe he's feeding you bad information. So you think I'm the one being manipulated? I think your emotions are clouding your judgment. I could say the same thing to you. [rock music continues distantly] So I know that you executed that other cell. And I know why you brought me up to Griffith Park. When the Redhats were headed to your house, I still called you. Do you know why? Because you're the reason I joined the Resistance, and not Quayle. The man is a lot of things, Katie, but he's not a sell-out. He saved my ass five or six times when it would have been much easier to just walk away. I get that you and Quayle have a history. I need you to believe me that this is real. Thanks for the heads-up. [ominous music] Are you talking to the Occupation? Is that a real question? This comes from Katie, right? Use your head. Her husband got to us. Got to you. They know your real name. They found your house, and that was deeply hidden. You do know that Katie was the one who tipped me that the Redhats were coming. Well, maybe she knew they were coming because she set you up. Maybe she's playing a longer con. You didn't answer my question. Am I talking to the Occupation? No, I am not. I reviewed the details of this op. It's solid. I want to meet with the other cell. I'll start working out the details. In order to move forward, you gotta be willing to cut off all contact with Katie Bowman, both personal and professional. Understood. [knocking on door] Hey. - [music playing] [baby cries] You want a drink? Sure. [music continues distantly] My brother's alive. Holy sh1t. That's great. My dad's working for the Occupation because he thinks it's gonna help us get him back. It might. He's crazy for trusting those assholes. You know what I can't stop thinking about? What we saw on the moon. I mean, it has got to be a base. Maybe it's the Factory. I did some research, and there's all kinds of specialized equipment at USC and up on Mount Wilson, and maybe the RAPs didn't bother to destroy that stuff since it's outside the Zone. Well, that's great. [laughs] But it doesn't matter. Because we're locked in here. What if we aren't? [dramatic music] Where is he? Waiting to make sure he isn't being set up. How do we know we're not being set up? We don't, but you wanted to meet him. [tense music] So, you're the guy, huh? What do I call you? Whatever you want. Care to explain, Mr. "Whatever-You-Want," why I should trust a man willing to stab his own friends in the back? Because you're a survivor, like me. I can give you what you need. Something real. Broussard. If you want him, you need me to set him up. In exchange, he wants to get outside the Colony. Why would you want that? Because I'm a pessimist when it comes to the future of the bloc, and I have no desire to live under the thumb of you or your compatriots or the RAPs. I want a Transit Pass, coded to let me through whatever Wall I want. Irrevocable. Hey, come on. Don't act dumb. You know they exist. They're issued by the Governor-General's office. The bloc governors don't have authority over the transit zones. The pass, and a fully-stocked pick-up truck. To avoid confusion, here's a list. And I get Broussard. I'll set up a meeting. Broussard'll be there. Along with some other bonus prizes. And then, when everyone is in your custody, your man Bowman here will escort me through the Wall and out of the Colony. All right. You have a deal. One piece of advice. When you're going after Broussard... don't miss. [dramatic music] [crowd chatter] [suspenseful music] [overlapping radio chatter] Section one secure. There's the signal. Broussard's here. Keep in contact. So where is he? He's here. [tense music] Redhats. Redhats. It's blown. [crowd screams] Go. Go, Rachel, go! [firecrackers popping] [people screaming] Protect the asset. We got him. Let's go, let's go! Potential target taking evasive action. White female, short brown hair, blue shirt. Officers, engage. [shouting, commotion] No! [gasps] [crowd screaming, shouting] Do we have eyes on the target? Negative. He blew past Lagarza's position, then we lost him in the chaos. You had one job! Protect the perimeter! I got her. You don't got sh1t. Will? Come in. What's up? We lost him. [somber music] I just want to know how this man somehow escaped a battalion of Redhats specifically positioned to capture him. Because he's a pro. And mistakes were made. But the cell's blown up. Broussard's gonna have a very hard time operating. Yeah, I bet we'll never hear from that guy again. Bravo. Truly excellent work. Like finishing third in the Super Bowl. I have something you need to see. The informant? We captured him with one of the cameras in the market, so I cross-matched his face in the Rolodex. Alexander Quayle. Former CIA station chief in Berlin. He moved to Defense Intelligence in 2004 to help run their operations division, but was forcibly retired after something went wrong during a mission in Beirut. The mission details were scrubbed, but the file had a list of the informants, including this guy, cover name Ahmed Ali Farah. So Quayle's obviously not some low-level operative. Maybe we can still save this sh1t show. Let's get him into interrogation. Where is he now? We stashed him at the Hoover Street rendition house. All right, we'll bring him in. So do you think this is the kind of guy who knows how to keep a secret? Not once Snyder locks him down in that basement. And we're not gonna let them torture a man who served his country now, are we? All right. Then go on in there, get that shithead, and we'll figure it out together. [knock at door] I'm here to see Quayle. Yes, sir. This way. Leave us alone. I hope you brought me a Transit Pass. Snyder cancelled the deal. Can you disappear in this bloc? I could hide in your house for six months. You'd never even know I was there. But here's the play-- you claim that these idiots didn't search me in the right way. You walked in here, I got the jump on you, and you had to help me out the back door. And I never see you again. No one does. Why did you recruit her? I didn't. Broussard did. Your wife is an admirable woman. Rebellion is in her bones. She truly believed she could've made a difference. But the truth is... we're kidding ourselves. But Katie has hope, and hope can keep you going a long time. How did he get to her? Broussard and I both saw great potential in Katie. The art of deception is a natural talent, and your wife has it in spades. Come on. Let's go. [thud] Hey! What-- [Quayle wheezing] [exhales] [running footsteps] It's me. [dramatic music] All right. Now what? He was dead when we got there. The guards were too. Must have been Broussard. How could Broussard possibly know about our rendition house? How's he pull off half the things he's done? I don't like it either, sir, but that's how it went down. Something about this doesn't smell right. I want the truth, or all the goodwill that you've built with me, favors that you thought you were owed-- gone! Good-bye! I made a mistake with you, giving you that much latitude. The truth is simple-- I own you. And if any of this backhand bullshit continues, you will both go to the Factory and spend the rest of your miserable lives regretting not taking advantage of my generosity. [sighs] Whoa. Thanks. Yep. I didn't have a choice. I couldn't trust Quayle. Well, you did what you had to do. Problem is, I don't know how long that cock-and-bull story we told Snyder is going to hold up. What's Big Bear like this time of year? Whew, man. Damn nice. Ha. But there is the small matter of a 300-foot Wall standing in our way. There is. [overlapping chatter] [somber music] You shouldn't have come. Listen, I'm radioactive, so we can't see each other for a while. [sobs] But this isn't over. Opportunity will come again, and when it does, I want you there with me. Katie... This is why we fight. I know. We still fighting? You tell me. [sighs] I hope not. How was your day? Fine. Yours? Good. My day was good. The cell that attacked us is done. Their leader and a couple of others are dead. You don't have to worry about them anymore. [dark music]
