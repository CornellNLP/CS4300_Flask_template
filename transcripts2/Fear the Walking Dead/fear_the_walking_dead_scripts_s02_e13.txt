 Previously on Fear the Walking Dead... 
 What are we doing, dad? 
 Managing. Surviving. 
 Who are they? 
 We're so close to home, you guys wanna hitch a ride with us? 
 We could use a couple more guys like you. 
 Hey! 
 Put the gun down! 
 You're outnumbered, put down the gun! 
 Hey! 
 No! 
 Turn it off! 
 No, I can't! 
 The whole world can see us. 
 (people shouting) 
 Yeah, her mistake. 
 She knows. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm sorry.

 (no audio) 
 (gunshot) 
 (voices echoing) 
 Derek : Shut up, shut up! 
 James : I don't wanna die here! I don't wanna die! 
 Derek : Just let me goddamn think! 
 James : I'm gonna die. 
 No way, bro, we're not gonna let that happen. 
 James : What do you mean, man? 
 What are you gonna do? I'm bleeding. 
 Brandon : The bullet might have hit an artery. 
 If it did, he wouldn't be talking right now. 
 What the hell do you know? 
 You said you were a teacher. 
 I was. 
 What'd you even teach? What'd he teach? 
 English lit. 
 LAUSD made me take a course every year. 
 Oh, Christ. 
 I'd do CPR, first responder basics. 
 I know a little, not a lot. 
 I need to look at this, okay? 
 (screams) 
 It's gone through and through. That's good. 
 How is that good? 
 We don't have to dig out the slug. 
 So you take both hands. Top and bottom, squeeze together nice and tight. 
 We have to stop that bleeding. 
 (James screams) 
 I'm gonna try to stitch it up. 
 With what? 
 With whatever I can find in his house. 
 Derek : It's gonna be okay. Hey, hey, hey. 
 (screaming) 
 You okay, bro? 
 My man can take the pain. 
 What pain? 
 Exactly. 
 (laughs) 
 (screams) 
 All right, we have to roll him over. 
 What? We're not done? 
 You've still got an exit wound, bro. 
 Help me move him. 
 (screaming) 
 Talk to me, man. What's going on? 
 It hurts, huh, when we move you? 
 Okay, I need you to breathe. 
 Okay, here's what we're gonna do. 
 I'm gonna stitch you up. 
 When we're done, I'm not gonna move you. 
 Okay. 
 Not gonna move you anymore. 
 Okay? 
 For how long? 
 Until he's better. 
 But he'll get better? 
 Yeah, yeah, he's gonna get better. 
 Okay. 
 (hammering continues) 
 (breathing heavily) 
 I don't even know your name. 
 (men laughing) 
 You're so- 
 Yo, James. 
 What you in the mood for, man? 
 Breast, wing? 
 Anything but a thigh, man. 
 (laughs) 
 Travis : How you feeling? 
 Pretty good. Better. 
 What's your pain level? 
 Scale of one to 10? 
 Like, a three. 
 Three? 
 Maybe a four. 
 Well, four is still pretty good considering. 
 The protein will help, though... with the healing, don't you think? 
 Can't hurt. 
 Listen, I can't help you if you won't tell me what's going on. 
 So if things are getting any worse, you need to let me know. 
 Try and get some rest. 
 You gonna have any chicken, Mr. Manawa? 
 No, we should be eating the eggs. 
 Chris, come on. 
 We need to talk. 
 Sure. 
 What do you want? 
 Wipe your face off first. 
 Why? 
 Because you're covered in grease. 
 What difference does it make? 
 You killed a man today, Chris. 
 Look at him. 
 The least you could do is let is affect your appetite. 
 I need to know what's going on. 
 What are you thinking, huh? 
 I mean, are you thinking anything? 
 He shot James. 
 Dad, he shot my friend. What was I supposed to do? 
 He's not your friend. 
 He is. 
 They are. 
 They are savages. 
 So I'm a savage. Is that what you're saying-- 
 Chris, where the hell is your remorse? 
 This is how it works now. 
 Look around. 
 There is no more good, there is no more bad, right or wrong. 
 It's us or them, kill or be killed. 
 And James, he's one of us. 
 You've known these guys for two days. 
 Did what I had to do. 
 I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry. 
 Oh, God. 
 Remember the first few months of middle school? 
 Middle school? 
 I would hide every recess because the football guys used to make fun of me. 
 Remember that? 
 What'd you use to tell me? 
 I told you to play along. 
 To try to fit in. 
 Well? 
 The lesson was to play along, to act as if, not to become one of them. 
 You don't fit in with these guys. 
 We all know that. 
 But what you did, saving James today, that was huge. 
 You proved your worth. 
 Shoot, you could come out of this a hero. 
 I don't want to be a hero to these guys and neither should you. 
 Look, just be careful how you play this, Dad. 
 We need them. 
 No, we don't. 
 I do. 
 (people shouting) 
 (woman shouting in Spanish) 
 Open the gate. Open the gate. 
 Oscar : No. 
 Is she crazy? 
 That's Travis. 
 That's who I was talking to you about. 
 He's family. He's family. 
 That's my family. 
 Ah! 
 Where's Chris? 
 I don't know. 
 (shouting, clamoring) 
 Man : ¡Al dentro! 
 You want to shower? 
 No. 
 You hungry? I could get you-- 
 No, Maddy. I don't need anything. 
 Where's Nick? 
 He ran off like he always does. 
 Any idea where? 
 I think he's north. 
 In Tijuana. 
 Sorry. 
 Where's Chris? 
 I had no choice. 
 Trav, where is he? 
 Wake up. Gotta go. 
 What's going on? 
 It's moving day, is what's going on. 
 Why? 
 We're all out of chickens. 
 We should have been eating the eggs. I told you that. 
 I'm gonna be honest with you, teach, your schoolmarm sh1t's is getting old. 
 So what about James? 
 No, I'm good to go. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. Absolutely. 
 Okay, so a scale of one to 10? 
 It's zero, man. 
 He's better. 
 He's not ready. 
 Dad. 
 We only gave him a week. 
 This isn't the space shuttle. 
 We're taking a ride in a pickup. 
 Where? 
 San Diego, like we planned. 
 USA, baby. USA. 
 San Diego is burned. We told you that. 
 There's nothing more there than here. 
 Yeah, that's bullshit. 
 Chris, tell them what we saw. 
 We never went to San Diego. 
 Oh, for Christ's sake. 
 We never landed there. Never saw anything. 
 It is gone. 
 This isn't a debate, Travis. 
 We're not debating this. We're packing up the truck and we're leaving. 
 Now, you can come, but you've got to stop with all this yap, yap, yap. 
 We got to go. 
 Right on. 
 Now, let's roll. 
 Yeah, let's go. 
 Dad, we need a hand. 
 Remember what the date is? 
 What? 
 The date. 
 No. 
 Dad, I lost track. What does it matter? 
 They're waiting on us. 
 Well, you tell them to sit and wait. 
 Grab a corner. 
 Four corners, four of us. 
 We'll lift him up, slide him right in. 
 Let's do this sh1t. 
 (James grunts) 
 Ah! 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 Chris and I will get in the back with him. 
 Cool. I'll control the tunes. 
 Like hell, you will. It's driver's choice. 
 Pad that down. 
 See you, Mexico.

 Stop the truck. 
 Don't make them stop, please. Don't make them stop the truck. 
 (groans) 
 ♪ Ain't you happy I chose rap ♪ 
♪ I'm amongst the streets... ♪ 
 Travis : Brandon! 
 Stop the truck. Brandon. 
 (pounding) 
 Come on, Brandon. 
 Stop the goddamn truck or your friend dies.

 Derek : We can't keep doing this. Waiting. 
 Brandon : No, and I don't like it, but we've got to learn from today. 
 I don't see him getting any better. 
 We're gonna need to come to terms with that. 
 Chris : So what are we saying? 
 Yeah, what are we saying? 
 You wouldn't understand. 
 The hell's wrong with you? 
 Huh? You're supposed to be his friends. 
 Stop it. 
 He's not getting better. 
 He would if you'd give him a chance. 
 Jesus, you gave him a week. 
 He's fighting and we need to help him. 
 I mean, give him some time for his blood to clot up inside. 
 That's what they do in the hospitals. 
 We're not in a hospital. 
 Well, this is as good as it gets. 
 Look around. Think about it. 
 We can survive here long enough for him to heal. 
 We've been here for a week. 
 It's safe. There's no infected. 
 Come on, guys, you can save James. 
 He would understand. 
 No, he is scared to death of you guys. 
 I'm starting to get why. 
 I don't know what to tell you, man. 
 Dad, what are you doing? 
 Just stay away from him. 
 Relax, bro. He's not gonna do anything with it. 
 You're not gonna kill him. 
 And you're not gonna kill us. 
 You don't have the balls to. 
 (gunshot) 
 What the hell? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 I'm doing this for you. 
 James : What's with the gun? 
 Your buddies, they want to put you down. 
 They're saying that you'd understand. 
 Why do you think I agreed to get in the truck? 
 I don't understand, why kill you? 
 Why not just leave you here? 
 Back down in the Sea or Cortez we had a friend with us. 
 Yeah, your friend who got bitten, right? 
 Yeah, Troy. 
 You know, he was-- he was sick and we were still figuring sh1t out. 
 We didn't know how it worked. 
 We didn't know what was gonna end up happening to him. 
 We knew there was no way he was not gonna turn. 
 Troy knew that, so he made us promise not to let that happen to him. 
 And we didn't. 
 No matter where we go, it's the same story just different people. 
 No, when the time came, Troy got-- he got spooked. 
 I mean, he lost a nerve, started begging us not to. 
 Trying to get us to stop. 
 Brandon was the one that was supposed to be doing it, but he couldn't-- he couldn't pull the trigger. 
 So I grabbed the gun, I looked him in the eye, I said I was sorry. 
 Figured that was the least I can do. 
 Then he was gone. 
 This is different. 
 You're not sick. 
 What do you call this? 
 You're not dying. 
 You're gonna get better. All you need is time. 
 No, it doesn't matter. 
 What matters is they think I'm dying. 
 That's the deal. 
 I'm dead weight. 
 (knocks) 
 Travis : Yeah? 
 Chris : It's me. 
 (knocks) 
 What do you want? 
 To talk. 
 And I thought you might be hungry, so I brought you some food. 
 It's not much, but did my best. 
 Set it down. 
 Arms up. Turn around. 
 I'm not carrying. 
 Just do it. 
 You don't trust me? 
 I want to. You have no idea how much I want to. 
 Where are the others? 
 Down the road. 
 There was a waystead. They went to take care of it. 
 They headed this way? 
 No. Maybe. I don't know, Dad. They were bored. 
 Sit down. 
 Look, I-- I just want to say, Dad, that I get it. 
 Oh, you get it? 
 What is it that you get? 
 What you're trying to teach me. 
 I mean, you don't even like James. 
 No, I don't, son. 
 But you're still trying to save him anyways. 
 And why is that? 
 Because his life still matters. 
 And we're not disposable. 
 I mean, they've known James since he was, like, six years old and they're still gonna kill him. 
 Imagine what they'll do to me if anything happens, Dad. 
 No, I'm gonna get us out of here. 
 Okay? 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Okay. 
 I promise you. I promise you. 
 You guys! You guys! 
 Chris, what are you doing? 
 Chris, what the hell? 
 Let me go. 
 I got him. 
 Shut up! 
 No. No, man. 
 Brandon. 
 Just don't do this. 
 I'm sorry, bro. 
 Leave him with me. 
 Look, I can get better. 
 Just give me a little more time. I promise. 
 Brandon, don't! 
 Shut up! 
 I'm begging you, man. 
 Both of you. 
 Travis : Chris, don't let them do this. 
 Show me mercy! 
 (gunshot) 
 Chris. 
 Can we talk for a second? 
 Yeah, come here. 
 He's not coming with. 
 He knows. 
 Elias. 
 Who's that? 
 The farmer. His name was Elias Suarez. 
 Born 1961, February 12. 
 That's your birthday. 
 You said we shouldn't be surprised by coincidences. 
 This is forever, Chris. 
 You drive away, I won't be able to find you. 
 You're barely 16 years old. Don't do this. 
 Dad, what do you want me to do? 
 Stay with you? 
 We were doing fine on our own. 
 Were we? 
 Yeah, we can. Now I can walk, we can. 
 Dad, your way, it doesn't work. 
 It can't. 
 Chris, I promised your mother that I would take care of you. 
 And you are. 
 What? 
 By letting me go, you are. 
 Dad, you won't do what needs to be done. 
 I'm better off without you. 
 Look, this whole time you had me thinking I was broken. 
 But I wasn't. I'm not. 
 I was just-- I was adapting. 
 I'm good now. 
 I am begging you not to do this, Chris. 
 Want to know the funny part? 
 With Mom, you did it. 
 What did I do? 
 You found it in you to do what needs to be done. 
 And then you lost it. 
 Chris, you have got it all backwards. 
 There is a difference. 
 Not anymore. 
 (engine starts) 
 Let's roll. 
 See ya, Pops. 
 Brandon : You all good, bro? 
 Take me home. 
 It's not too late. I'm begging you, Chris. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Chris. 
 Come on. 
 Get out of the truck. 
 Chris. 
 Chris! 
 God damn you, Chris! 
 What are the chances? 
 Of? 
 Two days, I'm walking trying to find my way to the ocean. 
 And when I do finally see the water... 
 I see the hotel lit up like a goddamn beacon and it's you. 
 We got lucky. 
 Did we? 
 What are you saying? 
 If I hadn't seen that light... 
 I never would have had to tell a soul what I did. 
 Travis, you didn't do anything wrong. 
 I left him. 
 Baby, come here. 
 You need to listen to me, okay? 
 He was my son and I left him. 
 We're gonna get through this. 
 We're gonna get through it. 
 I failed him, Maddy. 
 I failed him and I failed her. 
 You said it yourself, Travis. You said it. 
 He didn't leave you any choice. 
 I could have gone along with it. 
 Let them kill James. 
 Would have been the wrong thing to do, but I would have done right by my son. 
 He's still out there. 
 He is. You got to believe that. 
 That night at the vineyard-- 
 Oh, don't. 
 I was wrong. I was. 
 He threatened Alicia. He threatened your daughter. 
 I regret saying that. 
 No, you were right. 
 Before you and I were a family, Liza, Chris, and I, we were a family. 
 So all that "they're our children" sh1t I was spewing, that was naive. 
 Travis. 
 You and I were parents first. 
 And your responsibility that night was to Alicia and you were doing what you were supposed to do. 
 My responsibility was to Chris. 
 And I promised her I would protect him. 
 I know. 
 The whole way walking here, you know what I thought? 
 I forgot to tell him I loved him. 
 The second he was too far away, I realized the last thing I said to him was, "God damn you." 
 That's the last thing his father said to him. 
 That's the last thing he'll remember. 
 You didn't know him when he was little, but he had this huge heart. 
 He was such a good boy. 
 I know. 
 When you met him he was already so angry. 
 At me, Liza. 
 We took away his family. He lost his place. 
 He lost-- he had no place. 
 I loved him. I never stopped. 
 All he saw was my disgust at what he turned into, what I let him become. 
 It is, it's all he'll ever know. 
 He knew. 
 No. 
 No. 
 It was true then, but now, I don't... 
 What? Tell me. 
 We're all living minute by minute here. 
 Every single one of us. And at the drop of a hat, it could all be done. 
 You won't have a chance. 
 I just wish I told him, that's all. 
 I have to find Alicia. 
 (murmuring) 
 (coughing) 
 Andrés. 
 We had to let them in. 
 43 of them. 
 We don't have enough for nearly half. 
 This is bad. I've seen maybe a third of them. 
 Once I've examined everyone, we'll work in shifts, come up with a plan. 
 Decide who's safe and who's not. 
 And then what to do with those who aren't. 
 Where's Alicia? 
 Gracias. 
 Is he okay? 
 He'll be okay. 
 Can you come with me? 
 (walkers hissing) 
 Mom? 
 There's something I didn't say last night. 
 Something I need you to understand. 
 You don't need to say anything. 
 I understand. 
 No, you don't. 
 Okay? You can't. 
 So just hear me out, okay? 
 Okay. 
 It's about your father. 
 His accident... it wasn't an accident. 
 What? 
 I just-- I thought I was doing the right thing by not telling you. I didn't know. I just-- I didn't know what-- 
 You told me he fell asleep. 
 He didn't. 
 Mom. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Are you sure? 
 I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't. 
 He crashed his car. 
 How can you possibly be certain if you don't know-- 
 There was a note. He left a note. 
 They found it in his glove box. 
 What did it say? 
 It's not important. 
 It's not important? 
 Baby, he was a man of few words, okay? 
 And he could be quite precise if he wanted to. 
 Tell me. 
 "I love you all... but enough's enough." 
 And that's it? 
 Yeah. 
 (sobbing) 
 What about Nick? Does Nick know? 
 No. 
 Nick is the reason why. 
 Why I kept it a secret. 
 There's so much of your father in Nick, you know? 
 The way he could light up a room with his smile. 
 Or silence it with his mood. 
 It's impossible to ignore. 
 You just couldn't not see it. 
 They shared the same demons. 
 Hold my hand. 
 I was always so afraid of Nick ending up like him that I-- 
 It's okay. 
 No, you deserve better. You deserve more. 
 So much more. 
 But you have to know that I never-- I never ever loved you any less. 
 Not ever. 
 I just thought you were all right. 
 I had to be. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know. 
 I'm so, so sorry. 
 I love you, too. 
 Thank you. 
 (water running)
