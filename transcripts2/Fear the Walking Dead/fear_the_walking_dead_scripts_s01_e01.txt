 ( faint wind whistling ) 
 Gloria. 
 ( faint clang ) 
 ( metal clatters ) 
 ( distant clank ) 
 Man :  Gloria. 
 Glo. 
 ( distant screaming ) 
 ( distant banging ) ( gasps ) What? ( whispers ) Gloria? ( panting ) Gloria, babe, we got to go. Jesus! No. No. No. ( growling ) ( panting ) ( heart beating ) ( motor humming ) ( tires squeal ) Man :  Call 911. Someone call 911. I didn't even see him. ( horns honk ) ( sirens wailing ) Yo, yo, man. You okay? Yo. I-- I didn't even see him. Woman :  He just walked right into it. Somebody was hit by a car. He needs an ambulance. I don't know. He just ran into... ( horns honking ) Woman :  He just ran out. ( sirens wailing ) ( helicopter blades whirring ) ( theme music playing ) Babe, you ready? Alicia? Come on, we got to go. Got to go. Got to go. ( knocks ) You got five minutes. Did I say come in? Jesus, Mom. Don't slam the door. Man :  Come on. Should have got your ass out of bed 30 minutes ago. ( metal clanging ) Man :  Come on, you son of a bitch. How's that working out, babe? Ye of little faith. Ye of no faith. You know the plumber's card's on the fridge. Yeah, I know. That guy the Poirers use. Yeah. She ready yet? Alicia, come on! ( groans ) You know she won't eat that. It's gluten-fricking-free. I think I just saved us 300 bucks. Leak fixed. I don't believe it. Oh, yeah. ( faint radio playing ) Mmm. Really? Good morning. You fixed it? Mm-hmm. So hot. Mmm. Mmm. ( phone ringing ) Okay. Get it. ( ringing continues ) Hello. He has a bruised rib, contusions. Physically, your son is lucky, but I'm more worried about-- Woman : Toxicology? There's that, yes, but-- Heroin's his drug of choice. What did he take? - He's over 18, ma'am. I can't tell you any more than I could tell the police. They're here? You should have led with that. Nick presented as delusional, Mrs. Clark. Witnesses said he ran into traffic with intent. He was high. He was ranting. We had to restrain him. I requested a psych consult. She's not listening. She heard you. Police officer :  Nick. Buddy. You with me? Nick. ( whistles ) ( snaps fingers ) I went for a walk. You were running, Nick. I went for a run. Barefoot, down "Needle Alley"? Man, Kenyans run barefoot. Uh-huh. You said someone got hurt. You remember that? You were raving about "flesh and blood and viscera." Um, it's runner's high. Yeah. Oh, I don't know what "viscera" is. Tell us where you scored. Lots of kids buying in that hood. We clean it up, you come out a hero. ( laughs ) Nick, you could have died. Yeah, coulda, woulda, shoulda. Police officer :  Okay, we'll take it from the top. Nick, why were you running? Is my son under arrest? No, ma'am. Then get out. Thank you. Leave. We could charge him. Well, charge him when he's healed. For now, go away. She do all the talking? Get the-- get out. I'm not as eloquent. What happened? L.A. is not a pedestrian-friendly city. Nick. I just tried to beat the light. Why the restraints? I don't know. Ask the lab coat. Did you try to hurt yourself? Nick :  No, Mom. Come on, it was an accident. It was just an accident. All right, I'm gonna call for a bed. No, no, no. Mom, no. Hey, I'm not going back. It's how we help you. No, we can't help me. Listen to your mother, Nick. You definitely can't help me. Hey. You can't do sh1t. Madison :  Nick. Nick :  Really. You can't-- He's just-- None of you can-- can you just leave me alone? Can you just let me go? There's an idea. Alicia, not helpful. I'm not trying to help, Travis. What did you say? It's none of his business anyway. You know what? Go to the car. Go. Travis :  It's okay. Please just leave me alone. Everyone take a breath, huh? Travis :  Take a moment. ( phone ringing ) ( ringing continues ) Tell me what happened. It's just you and me. Glad you moved in? Yeah. Liza. Did you find him? Travis :  Yeah, wanted to let you guys know. He okay? Banged up, but he'll recover. Liza :  Hard part comes now. Yeah. Liza :  You gonna be okay for the weekend? What do you mean? Can you still take Christopher? I don't want to go. Chris, it's Dad's weekend. He has a say. Well, I get a say in this and I don't want to go. Let me talk to him. Well, maybe I don't want you here, Mr. Unpleasant. Maybe I have plans. Chris :  I'll stay at Dante's. Look, I'm not gonna go to some hospital for the weekend. Liza :  Christopher! Let me talk to him. Please. Talk to your father. I don't want to come. Well, it's my weekend. Fine, Dad. Force me. Let's bond. What do you got planned for the weekend? Come on, I'm doing the best I can. Yeah, but that really doesn't help. We're all building a family, okay? All of us. Now, coming here to support Nick's not the worst thing. It's up there. He's not my friend and he's not my brother. He'd be there for you. He wouldn't have to be there for me. Not like that. No. Chris :  Mom. Well? Um-mmm. Keep him. ( phone beeps ) ( intercom beeps ) Woman on P.A. :  Paging Dr. Cook. Paging Dr. Cook, please. Madison :  Glad you're okay. Hey. Was that Liza? Yeah. She sends her love. Or something resembling love. Oh, I've got college counseling today. Kids have applications due. Go. I've got to find a facility. Somewhere he's not already blacklisted. I can do that. Stacy can sub. I can't leave him like this. Leave him with me. I'll stay. I'm sorry, babe. Why? I love you. Well, you're stupid. Mmm. Because you didn't sign up for this. I did. You didn't sign up for all this. Yes, I did. I signed on for exactly this when I fell in love with you. Don't go sentimental. And everything that goes with you. You just throw up in your mouth a little? Yeah, a little bit. ( faint music playing over headset ) He's gonna be okay. Would you take those off? I can hear you. Would you take them off, please? "He's going to be okay." Yes, he will be. Thank you. Well, while he's restrained. What? Could you carry some hope into the discussion? He's an adult. You can't just ship him off to rehab. You can't send him away like when he was young. All you can do now is what Nick said. I'm not cutting off your brother. He's worse. Just needs to get the junk out of his system. Okay. Audience No. 2 playing ♪ And the Gulf sign ♪ 
♪ Split the screen up ♪ 
♪ And the Gulf sign split... ♪ Uh... yeah, I don't think any of this is gonna happen before lunch. Talk to me around 2:30. Good morning, Maddy. Artie. Thanks. Make sure it doesn't go in my box, okay? Lot of kids out sick today. Thought you were another victim. No, I got my flu shot. Oh. You all right? ( bell rings ) Yeah, yeah. We found Nick. Oh, thank the good Lord. You must be relieved. So relieved, yeah. He all right? He's at Temple Hospital. Travis stayed, so Stacy's gonna take his classes. Ah, well, Stacy can't teach her way out of a paper bag. Yeah. You sure you want to be here? Yeah, it's just for today. I'm good. ( alarm beeping ) Guard :  Hold up right there. Hold up. Hold on there, son. I'm okay. I'm okay. Glad to hear it. Empty your pockets. Stop running, Tobias. Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. Empty your pockets, son. Listen up, Tobias. Do what Mr. Costa says. Check your pockets. ( coins jingle ) 77 cents. Keep it. Haven't seen you in a while. How's things at home? I got it. Let's go have a chat. See you, Artie. All right. ( bell rings ) Come on, hand it over. You know what I'm talking about. Right pocket. Thank you. ( sighs ) Sit down. What's going on? Nothing. What's the blade for? Whittling. Okay. Is somebody bothering you? Is it Dominic Fratto? He's been okay. I tutor him now. Algebra I. Remedial moron. ( sighs ) Okay. So why the knife? Hey, I could expel you just for crossing the threshold with that thing. No, plea-- it's safer in numbers. Safer from what? Tobias, please, don't screw yourself like this. You've been working your ass off. You're on track to go to college. ( scoffs ) Yeah, no one's going to college. No one's doing anything they think they are. What? What are you talking about? Can I get my knife back, please? No, you can't get your knife back. They say it's not connected. They say that, but I don't believe them. It is. From reports in five states. They don't know if it's a virus or a microbe. They don't know, but it's spreading. You need to-- No, people are killing. You need to spend less time online, okay? If-- if there's a problem, we're gonna know about it. The authorities would tell us. ( scoffs ) Yeah. Sure. You're right, Miss C. Can I go now, please? Yeah, you can go. ( coins clatter ) ( door closes ) Spread it out! Bill! Bill! Defense! ( spray can hissing ) Paint-by-numbers bullshit. Senior project. It's supposed to be fun. What'll be fun is coming back and tagging it later. Aren't you supposed to be in Spanish? Am I? What period is it? Little asshole. You know, you could probably teach that class. Mmm. Want to take off? Unlike you, I'm not smart enough to be teaching classes. Well, I'm not with you because you're smart, Matt. Have fun. ( chuckles ) ( gasps ) You're having a nightmare. ( sighs ) No sh1t. You think that's what you saw was a nightmare? Hallucinations? Mmm. I really want to write it off like that, I do, but that's never happened to me before. Nothing like that. ( sighs ) Hey, maybe I'm losing my sh1t. That psych eval will decide that. "How crazy is Nick?" Scale of one to 10, huh? Hey, can you untie me? No, sorry. Hey. You think I'm dangerous? Docs are worried. Are you? You ran into traffic, man. You hurt yourself. No, I was running from, not to. I was running away from what I saw. What did you see? Uh, just a girl. Gloria. You know, she's my friend and she was-- Jesus Christ. ( sighs ) Okay, you buy on the corner and you can shoot at the church. It's junkie communion. And-- The church? Yeah, Glo was-- yeah, so she was with me when I scored. Yeah, and she was with me when I nodded. She was there. She was beside me. ( whispers ) But then-- then when I went down... everyone was dead. 'Cause there was blood. Yeah, and it's all over her mouth. You know? Then she came at  me. What did she do? Sh-- ( whispers ) she was eating them. She was eating them. Nick... you saw what the drugs saw. I don't know if what I saw came from the powder. That's the thing. I don't-- and if it didn't come from the powder, then it came out of  me. My mind. And if that came out of me, then I'm insane, Travis. Yeah, I'm insane. ( chuckles ) I really don't want to be insane. ( distant siren wailing ) ( rattles ) ( raspy breathing ) Ah, don't! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! ( whimpering ) Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Wait! Wait. What happened here? ( sobs ) ( yells ) Hey! Anyone here?! ( bangs ) ( grunts ) ( groans ) Oh, God. What--? What the hell is going on? No. You got an hour before the first bell. Mm... Okay. I need coffee before anything. Travis :  Here's your change of clothes. I'll be right back. That was sweet, you and the step. Not our step. Mom likes him. Who knows? She's used to disappointment. ( laughs ) ( faint humming ) I know what you think. What's that, bro? I know. What do I think? You're perfect and I'm not. You know, you're going to Berkeley, I got expelled from... Citrus Community. ( laughs ) I'm here, you're there. I don't compare myself. You can't not. Well, I don't compare myself with crazy. I'm not crazy. Well, you repeat the same behavior and expect different results. That's Merriam-Webster crazy. Hey, it's not gonna be like this anymore. It will. No. It'll be worse. Mm-mmm. I'm ending it now. I'm choosing to. Okay. Okay? Okay. Hey, babe? These shoes don't go. I went. I know, I appreciate it. No, the shooting gallery. I found it last night. What are you talking about? Something really bad happened there. I don't care. All right, Nick needs to know that whatever he saw was real or not. Of course it wasn't. He was raving when they found him. We're late again. Thank you. Travis, you cannot enable him. Well, I don't think he's lying, though. Oh, so you think someone ate someone? There's a lot of blood. It's a drug den. It was bad. Bad things happen there. Shootings and stabbings. ( car alarm chirps ) Why are you doing this? I want to help him. I know. I know, babe. Right? Yeah. But you can't use Nick to repair things with Chris. We'll help both of them. I promise. Okay? I got to go. Okay. ( car starts ) You need anything? Hey, what more could I possibly need? Nurse says the shrink will see you today. Can't wait. I'm sorry, Nick. Hey, it's nothing new. Get my head shrunk, get out, get clean. You mean that? I always mean it. Alicia :  I can't believe I did that for a week. Oh, I'm so done. ( Alicia sighs ) One more year. One more year and I'm gone. Matt :  What about me? Alicia :  Well, Berkeley's got a good arts program. Name me one artist I like from Berkeley. Exactly. We're only a few hours away. Same state, same time zone. Won't have to miss me that much. But I will. I will miss you that much. I just need to not be here. Saw your brother again? He doing better? Better than he was 48 hours ago? Sure. Better than he'll be two days after he's released? It's not on you, Alicia. ( sighs ) One more year. One more year. One more year. Hey, meet me after school. I can make this better. ( chuckles ) Yeah, how? You magic? Whoo. Your folks still out of town? Mm-hmm. Meet me at the beach. We can watch the sunset. Go back to my place. Get free from your family, I get you all to myself. We get each other. You like it? Mm. 
 
 Travis :  Question of the day. Now, what is London trying to teach us here? That wasn't a rhetorical question. You keep working on that. That's good. Way to go, Brandon. To think, good. To listen. To listen. Yeah, that's good. All right, anybody else? What do you think? What does London-- Put it away. Russell! Enlighten us. Come on, bud. I don't care about building a fire. Travis :  No? Can you build a fire? Russell :  I got a stove. ( class laughs ) Russell :  I got heat. I'm good. All right, all right. So what about this wolf dog? Does he care about the man in the story? Hell, no. Hell, no? Why? 'Cause the man tried to cut the damn dog open to keep his hands warm. That's gruesome. That's gruesome, but why would he do that? To build a fire. But why? Why would he build a fire? ( snaps fingers ) Think about it. Think about it. Why would he build a fire? To not die. Nailed it. See, man versus nature. London's trying to teach us how not to die. Good analysis, Russell. Imagine what would happen if you stayed awake in my class. ( class laughs ) So... Uh, so the man may offer warmth, he may offer food... Artie? Artie. You know how I have to evaluate each teacher each semester? Mm-hmm. I'm evaluating. Woman :  Next, divide both sides by two... Travis :  ...the dog abandons him. Mm-hmm. The dog is instinct. The dog is nature. And nature, well, nature always wins. ( raspy breathing ) Sir, are you okay? Making a break for it? Is he okay? Sure. I'm here for him and for you. Oh, no, I don't have to. I take my dog out when I want to, not the other way around. Oh, I'm the dog? You're the dog. Scooch. Um, do you think you could untie one hand, please? Come on, it'll be easier. Less messy. Just a little privacy. ( sighs ) I'll give you a moment. Thank you. ( clangs ) ( monitor beeping rapidly ) Oh, no. Code blue! Code blue! Room three! Room three! Code blue! ( monitor flatlining ) Doctor : When'd he go down? Nurse : Just now. 30 seconds, maybe. Doctor :  If we don't get a rhythm in 60, I want him downstairs. Doctor. Too much we don't know. Doctor. Charge to 200. Clear. Nothing. Doctor :  Charge to 250. Nothing. Okay, this gentleman needs to be downstairs now. Stay put. I'll be back for you. ( siren wailing in distance ) ( phone rings ) Madison : How does he just leave? He's over 18. They didn't release him. Shrink hadn't filed his evaluation. Maddy. He almost died, Travis. Wait, wait. Excuse me. Where's my son? I don't know. I'm sorry. What happened? His roommate coded. There was a second death on the floor. It was chaotic. You need to find him. You need to call the police. I'm sorry, he's gone. Nurse. Take me. Take me where it started. Travis :  There's nothing left to see there. He might go back. Wants to understand what he saw. Well, I went there. I saw. Maddy, trust me, you don't want to do this. I have to see it. Even if he's not there. I have to see it. Madison : This is where he disappears. Stay here. I'll go in. You think I'm waiting in the truck? Travis : Hello? There's no bodies. They couldn't just get up and walk away. Maddy. Something bad happened here. You said it yourself. Things happen here all the time. Yeah. It's a violent place. This isn't your fault, Maddy. It's in the genes. Nick's got problems, Alicia doesn't. Well, I'm batting .500. He's not here. Let's go, Maddy. No. This is where he slept. Maddy. What is it? It's Nick's. ( groans, sighs ) Hey. It's okay. Madison. Come away now, angel. Come away. ( crying ) Oh, God. ( dogs barking ) ( sirens wailing in distance ) Home? No, not yet. ( helicopter blades whirring ) Let's try Calvin's. ( vacuum humming ) Cal. Hey. ( vacuum turns off ) Miss C. Mr. Manawa. Cal. Good to see you, man. Hey. Hey, Cal. You look good. Thank you. You're looking for Nick. Yeah, he was in an accident. The cops picked him up. Have you seen him? He ran away from the hospital. No, I haven't seen him in a while. You got any ideas where he'd go? He wouldn't-- no. He wouldn't hang where he used to. He moved away from us. Yeah. Yeah. You want to come in? I could make some calls. Maybe someone's heard. Thank you. Yeah, of course. Anything for Nicky. Thanks, Calvin. Mm-hmm. ( line rings ) Chris's voice :  Hey, it's Chris. Leave a message. Hey, man. Listen, I'm sorry to call you, but I really, really-- like, I need to talk to you. Can you just-- can you hit me back? It's important. Okay, bye. ( music playing ) We're gonna find him. He doesn't want to be found. We'll bring him home. Travis, he'd rather sleep in that place than his own bed. I don't-- I don't know if I want him to come home. I get it. You do? I don't. What does that make me? ( sirens wailing ) Human. Weak. I'm just tired of waiting on the call from the morgue. Not gonna happen. We're gonna find him, we're gonna get him in rehab. I'm gonna drag him there if I have to. I will cuff our wrists together and drag his ass. I promise. ( sirens wailing ) ( helicopter blades whirring ) Better call Alicia. Get her to eat something. Might have been a high-speed gone bad. Officer on megaphone :  For your own safety, please remain in your vehicles. ( siren chirps ) Whoa! ( police radio chattering ) Can you see anything? No. ( people shouting ) Officer on megaphone :  Please remain in your vehicles at all times. ( people screaming ) ( gunshots ) Get back in the truck. What the hell is happening? Back in the truck. I'm getting out of here. ( helicopter blades whirring ) Only five? What, did you miss a few stops? I hope you guys got your flu shots. Teacher :  KTLA killed the feed before it went ugly,  but the cameras kept rolling. Someone leaked the footage. What the hell is this? Teacher :  Artie, check this out. Costa :  What? Guy's not dead. Traumatized from the accident or he is on something. Costa :  What the hell? Teacher :  Look how they beat the guy. There's an explanation. No one's offered it. Folks talking airborne toxins, poisoned water, viruses. Costa : This is why everyone's staying home. Teacher :  Look at this. How they unload on him. How he keeps coming. Costa :  I've got to call the district. See how they want to play this. This is what Nick was describing. Call the police. You're sure? We have to find him. I don't know how else to do it. ( exhales ) Nick :  Hey, man. Listen, I'm sorry to keep calling you,  but I got to know what went down at the church. Please just call me back. Teacher :  Traditional science deals with predictable phenomena such as gravity... Girl, your parents were there? My mom and Travis, yeah. ...electricity, chemical reactions. We're talking about nonlinear things weather, brain states... Ladies, am I confiscating phones today? It's not real. It can't be real. Watch, this here's the new real. Kill shot, bitch. Matt's not texting me. And you're not texting him. Give it up, Alicia. Costa on P.A. :  Good morning again, students. The district has decided today will be a half day. Repeat, today will be a half day. When the bell rings, proceed to your buses... Do you mind? ...in a calm, orderly fashion. ( bell rings ) I want you on the bus. What's going on? People are worried about the shooting. Wasn't that fake? I want you home, okay? What about Nick? Well, you'll be there if he comes back. When he comes back. When. Yeah, go, baby. Costa on P.A. :  Teachers and faculty, please report... Thank you. Hey. Let's get out of here before we get blocked in. I'll get the truck. ( students chatting ) ( music playing ) ( coughing ) Nicky, what's going on? Hey, Cal, I'm really sorry. What are you talking about? I'm sorry to put you in this position and-- Sit. Your mom's looking for you. What do you mean? Showed up at my folks'. Oh. Can't have that. Can't have people... No. ...coming to me looking for you. Hey, she doesn't know what you do, Cal. You're not talking about me? No. No, Cal. Cal. Hey, man, I-- she's just really worried about me. Cal, I swear. I swear, man. I would never hurt-- I would never-- I'd never tell anyone what you-- what you do. You hungry? No, no, no, no. You need to get some food up in you. No, no, no. I just-- I need to know what you gave me. I didn't give you anything. Was it laced, man? Was it PCP? Laced? Was it PCP? Yeah, I want my customers paranoid and pissed off and immune to pain. You talking about my sh1t? No. Then where's your head at? ( sighs ) Cal, the church, it was a bloodbath. It was a horror show. Gloria killed two people. And I need to get it out of my head. Gloria's 90 pounds soaking wet. Yeah. Barely strong enough to spike a vein. I know. You're not making any sense, Nicky. I know. I know. I know, but I saw it, Cal. I saw her do it and I need to get it out of my head. You need to contain yourself. You need to contain yourself. Okay, yeah. I'm so sorry, man. I'm leaving. Come on, stay. No, man, I'm gonna go. Nicky, stay. I get it. I get it. I get it. You think you saw some bad sh1t. ( crying ) I can't wipe it out. I can't. I can't scrub it out. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. How long has it been? Um, a couple of days. Couple days. Okay. I'm managing. Clearly. Clearly. I'm really trying. You got your works? No. I got you. Oh, man. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Let's go. Come on. Your mom told me you were in an accident. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I didn't look both ways. Cops talk to you? They had a lot of questions. Sit tight, brother. It's safe here. ( door opens, beeping ) ( door shuts ) ( trunk shuts ) ( knocks ) Come on. Nicky, come on. Come on. Come on, man. Hurry up, man-- oh, sh1t! No, Nicky! Nicky! ( grunts ) ( Nick screams ) ( gunshot ) Hey, Cal. Cal. Hey, Cal. ( train whistle blowing ) ( train whistle blows ) ( horn honks ) Nick :  No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Nick, hey, I said not to bring her. I told you not to bring her. Where have you been? We've been looking for you. Travis, I said not to bring her. Are you all right? I know. We've both been looking for you. Why wouldn't I? Are you okay? I did a-- I did-- I did a bad thing. It's okay. What are you talking about? It's okay, just get in the truck, Nick. It's not okay. Nicky, what happened? Okay, so he-- he pulled a gun on me. Who? Who did? - He pulled a gun on me and he tried to kill me. I wanted to know what was in-- what was in the sh1t he gave me, you know? What are you talking about, Nick? Calvin. I shot Calvin. Calvin? I shot Calvin. I killed Calvin. Where's Calvin? Where? Nick! Where? What are you talking about? Just... Madison :  It's my fault. Calvin must have gone looking for him. We don't know what we're dealing with here, Maddy. We don't know. I do. Whatever happened, it was self-defense, okay? Self-defense. Madison : That's his car. Madison : Calvin. Where was he? Wait. Wait a second. There's no one there. Calvin! He was here. Calvin! Nick, will you just--? No, no, no. He was here. Calvin. He was. He was-- he was here. He was here. Right here. There's nobody there, baby. There's nobody there. There's nobody there. There's no one here, Nick. He was. Nick, get in the truck. Let's go. Let's call Calvin, see what's going on. ( engine starts ) Travis :  Holy sh1t. Oh, my God. Stay here, Nick. Don't move. Madison : Calvin? No, no, no, no. Mom! Mom! Calvin, you okay? Mom! Mom! He'll kill you. Mom! Calvin, can you see me? Calvin, you're hurt. ( growling ) You need help. ( snarls ) For God's sake! Are you all right? Jesus, what-- watch out, Travis. Calvin! ( snarling ) ( tires squeal ) Ugh. Oh. ( faint growling ) No, Maddy. ( growling ) ( tires squeal ) ( brakes screech ) God. ( snarling ) What the hell is happening? I have no idea.
