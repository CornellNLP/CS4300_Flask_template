 Please. 
 Sit down, honey. Please, sit down.

 Y... yeah, Mom, are they grounding flights? 
 Uh, I don't know, baby, but I can drive if I have to. I'll get there. I'll get there.

 flight 462...  
 Hey, Mom, I think I gotta hang up. 
 Mom :  OK. Try to get some rest, all right? 
 [WOMAN SCREAMING] 
 Hey, what was that? 
 It's nothing, baby. Someone's just upset.

 It's the reflux. 
 How long has your husband been sick? 
 He's not sick. It's reflux. 
 His whole side of the family. 
 Doesn't seem like indigestion. 
 Are you a doctor? 
 Then mind your own goddamn business. 
 Hey, you think it's this flu that's been going around? 
 [SEATBELT WARNING BEEPING]

Hey, come on, let's have a seat. We have to land the plane! Tell the captain. We've been trying... It's not just Phoenix. Fights are going out everywhere. There's nowhere to land. [THUD] How did you know? [GRUNTS] Come on, let's go. I just want to see my husband. [SNIFFS] Ma'am, your husband is sick. So help him. There's nothing we can do. Let me tell him that I love him.
