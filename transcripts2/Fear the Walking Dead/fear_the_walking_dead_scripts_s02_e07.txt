 announcer : Previously, on "Fear the Walking Dead." 
 Bienvenidos! 
 Welcome! 
 You have a heavy smile, why? 
 All the killing. 
 I'm just a bit sick of it. 
 (gunshot) ♪♪ Mama, it's me. I'm worried about Papa. He's lost his way without you. (groaning and struggling) Ahh! I saw what you did... Why would I ever do that? First, let me go! You have to believe me! You're saying my son wants you both dead? What the hell are you doing? ♪♪ ( thunder rumbling ) ( gunshot echoes ) Ofelia :  Did you hear that? ( people shouting ) What's going on? Don't talk. Get your shoes. ( shouting continues ) Please, stop. You're hurting me. There's no time. Plea-- You need to keep up. ( breathing heavily ) I can't. I can't. What is the matter with you? I don't know. I don't feel good. Let me see you. Is it bad? ( gunshot echoes ) ( people shouting ) ( people running ) Where are your words now? What can you tell him? This man who loved you... Travis. ...who died believing your lies. You tell him the truth. That you looked inside yourself, You tell him that! No, that's enough. That's enough. Why are you here? Who are you? His friend. ( scoffs ) You are his fool. So was my son. Celia, I'm so sorry. Ofelia. Papa? Ofelia. What's wrong? I'm here. Are you okay? Yeah. Have you seen Chris? I can't find him. Help me look for him. I'm gonna check outside. Can you just-- No. Travis, he had a knife. The shot went off, he was in our room standing over me with a knife. Stop. He would never hurt you. Do you think I'm lying? I have to bury him. You don't deserve to bury him. It's what he wanted. What he wanted? What he wanted was what you promised. This man, my beautiful, stupid son, wanted you! He is not your son. Celia, hey, he didn't mean that. He didn't mean that. Stay out of it. They need some time. Please. You're going to let this boy do your begging? Fine. Now Thomas can get everything you have to offer. An empty hole, some dirt. You have one day. The sun comes down, I want you gone. All of you. ( insects chirping ) ( owl hoots ) Travis :  Chris! Chris! ( birds chirping ) ( rooster crows ) ( pigs squealing ) ( scraping ) ( flies buzzing ) ( grunts ) ( birds chirping ) ( water sloshing ) Pack whatever supplies we can carry-- food, water, anything you can get your hands on without drawing attention to yourself. And we need the truck to get back to the boat. Did you see where he put the keys? I'm not going back to the boat. Alicia, we don't have a choice. That sun sets, they'll force us off the land. Mom-- These people are not our friends. Get it through your heads. Both of you. This place is dangerous. That woman is dangerous. She's just upset. I can talk to her. You stay away from Celia. Do you hear me? Travis is coming over that hill. When he does, that's when we move. What if he doesn't? He is coming back. ( metal groaning, squeaking ) ( winces ) ( thumps ) ( clattering ) ( shouting in Spanish ) I'm looking for my son. ( shouting in Spanish ) Easy, easy. Okay. ( groaning ) My feet. Por favor. Agua. Thank you. My son. I'm looking for my son. No inglés. It's my feet. ( bell tolling ) ( birds chirping ) ( walker snarling ) Madison : Gracias. Oh, my God. ( snarling ) ( shouts in Spanish ) Nick. ( men shouting in Spanish ) ( Luis snarling ) Celia :  What do you see? Look at him. Is this death? What you see is my son. Changed, yes, but no less my son. My Luis. ( snarling ) Who you brought back to me. There are many who do not understand us. Or are afraid to. You are not. Why? I don't know. You belong here with us, Nicholas. With me. Stay. What about my family? You want to do the right thing. But they are not like you. Celia, they are not bad people. And when they look upon my son, what do they see? Go on, say it. A monster. Is that what we call these creatures who can't control their nature, their hunger? And what do we call those who destroy them? The ones who kill without thinking. Which is the monster? They will learn. My family won't hurt anyone. They will be safe here. You can't change them. Please. You will be responsible for their actions while they are here. _ Yes. Tell your family they are welcome to stay. But not Victor Strand. He doesn't belong here. He never did. This is not apocalypse. This is our beginning, Nicholas. The end of death itself. Life eternal. Don't do this. Don't put him in the ground. What? This place is unholy. It's infected. Even the dirt. The walls in this place. That woman, her dead. Hey. Your friend, he won't rest. He'll come back for you. You don't believe? If I did, I'd be with him right now. He will return. They return, but they're not the same. You're not the same. And they hate you for it. What's wrong with you? Don't put him in the ground. ( rooster crows ) Madison : Brought you these. No Travis yet? He'll be back soon. Don't worry. I worry. I know. You're different. Ever since we left LA. I was different before that. You know what I mean. I don't understand this fascination that you have with them. With the dead. They're not dead. Fine, infected. They're not infected. The word doesn't matter. Doesn't matter to you. What do you want me to call them? Their names. What is going on with you? The day you were swarmed at the beach, you come back all covered in God knows what. You don't change. And then you go ashore at the border. You're alone for hours there. Are you listening to yourself? Then you do this. You risk your life just to bring that thing back. You're talking like I'm using again. Is it Celia? Did she put you up to it? I can't talk to you when you're like this. Like what? I'm trying to understand. She wanted her son back. You can understand that! Right? So that's what I did, Mom. I just brought him back. And now we get to stay. You know, I'd do the same for you. What? I can bring Travis back. No. Mom, listen, nothing can touch me. You don't know that. I do. When I was on the beach, I came face-to-face with one of them and I didn't feel fear, I didn't feel hate. I just knew I wasn't going to die. Not there, not that way. I move among them, Mom. Invisible. I will not die. Ofelia. Ofelia. Sí? Come with me. Keep your eyes down. Don't talk. Why? She's waiting for us. Who is? Your mother. She's at the gate. She's outside. 
 
 Papa, it's going to be okay. What are you doing? Did you hear what I said? This place is evil! If we stay, we die. We have no place to go, Papa. ( all shouting in Spanish ) Wait! Papa! I know what you're going through. I know what he meant to you. What is it that you want? Nick. He's just-- I'm not the boy's daddy. I just thought that-- I don't know what's happening to him. Yes, you do. You take a vulnerable kid, an addict, drop him in a mess of death and doubt, it won't be long before he starts looking for something to cling to. In comes Mama Celia with her authentic Mexican cuisine, side of quasi-religious voodoo bullshit and voila. You bet your ass she's got her hooks in him. This isn't how I imagined us parting. ( sighs ) Where will you go? Back to the boat. Ha. If there is a boat. You interested? I can't leave without Travis. ( chuckles ) You should stay, take care of your own. I wish there was something I could do. ( chuckles ) Look at you. Getting all sentimental. We were the means to each other's end. We helped each other get here. It was a useful arrangement. Let's not go confusing things with vague terms like friend. Gracias. Your son? Is that your son? Ramon. I'm looking for my son. He's about this tall. Thin. He's got black hair. Have you seen him? Este? ( whispers ) Somebody in there? Please. He says he will hurt my boy if I don't make you leave. Okay. Why can't you just let me go? We're just going to let them throw him out? Alone? What do you want me to do? It's time for you to leave. I'm not done. It's time for you to leave. ( speaks Spanish ) I won't have violence here. Let him punish himself. You should hurry. It's a long way back in the dark. Where's my father? He is safe. Resting now. I want to see him. I can't allow that. The man he cut almost lost his eye. That wasn't his fault. He's a danger to himself, Ofelia. He's a danger to you. How long has he been unwell? I can't help him if you don't talk to me. He's not a bad man. Of course not. ( scoffs ) I've seen the way they look at me. Like I'm disgusting. Like I'm a monster. You're not a monster. You sure about that? Look at the boy, Chris. He's scared. ( gun clatters ) Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris. Go ahead! Come on! Come on! ( grunts ) ( knife skids ) ( panting ) I should have helped you. Look at me. I'm no good. I'm no good. You must be hungry. A ver. Vamos. You think I would poison a good pozole? Who would do such a thing? I am not the killer here. I see the way you look at me. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that's hatred in your eyes. But I am old enough to know fear when I see it. ( scoffs ) Those creatures you keep, they are an abomination, an act against God. It's not my dead you fear,  viejo. It is your own. Celia :  Cuántos, eh? Celia :  They haunt you. They hate you for your silence. You are dying. Can you feel it? Speak while you still have words. I have nothing to tell you. I have nothing to say to you. I don't want you to worry, Daniel. I will take care of you. There is a place for you here. ( panting ) What are you doing here? I came to bring you back. She really needs you. She's hurting. Come on. So does he. You found him. No, I didn't. And you didn't find me. He needs his father. Travis. Come on, man. I owe him that, don't I? Tell her you never saw us. Chris can't come back, not now. I can't come back. ( sighs ) Madison : You're making a mistake. Happens every day. You get older, you learn to forgive yourself. I owe him. He brought us out of hell. He got us here. I'm alive because of Victor. My children are alive because of Victor. He killed my son. That man killed my son. What more is there to say? I would think you of all people would understand. What about my son? You think I am filling his head with false faith? Yes. He is a remarkable soul. Openhearted. Fearless. The only reason you are here is because I see the light inside him. I know how rare it is. He understands. The changed ones are our responsibility. He's my responsibility. If you remain here, you will have to accept them as Nicholas does. As we accept them. It is a new world. I hope you can see it with new eyes. What if I can't do that? Then your son will choose between his family and the truth that they don't want to understand. I want to understand. I do. I need to understand. Come with me. ( gasping ) ( chuckles ) ( groans ) ( gunshot echoes ) ( infected snarling ) ( munching ) If your child was hungry, would you not feed him? If your child couldn't speak... would you not speak for him anyway? Even if your child could not love, would you not love him anyway? I would. What wouldn't you do for your children? ( growling ) Nothing. ( insects chirping ) ( horse whinnies ) ( grunts ) Don't worry about me. I'll hail a cab. ( beeps ) ( gate whirring ) ( snarling ) No. Daniel! Daniel! ( crying ) No... I'm sorry. He's gone. He's gone. It's all gone. Get in! We need to go now. Nick and Travis are coming back. Strand :  We'll be dead before they get here. We'll find them. We'll find them, okay? Strand : Ofelia, please. Come on. I need you in here, Ofelia. Go, now. I need you in. ( man shouting in Spanish ) Madison, let's go. ( Spanish continues ) Mom? Mom! Strand :  Madison! Madison! Mom, we've got to go! Madison, we need to move, now! ( men shouting in Spanish ) Strand :  Madison! Come on! Thank God. Nick. Strand :  We need to move! Nick, get in the truck! I couldn't find them. Okay. Where's Celia? Strand : Come on! Who did this? We have to go. We have to get back in the boat, Nick. We have to get back to the boat. She was right about us. What? Celia. She knew what we are. What are you talking about? Get in the truck, Nick. We destroy everything. Alicia : They're coming. We've got to go! ( snarling ) Madison, we need to move now. Alicia :  Nick, get in the truck! No. Nick, come on. Please, don't-- no, Nick. Strand :  Let him go. Madison :  No. Strand :  He's gone. Nick...
