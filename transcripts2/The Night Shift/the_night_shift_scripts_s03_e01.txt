 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm looking for my son... Francis Watkins. 
 He was brought in with a fever. 
 Toph : Uh... 
 I don't see any pediatric fevers on the board. 
 You know of any, Kenny? 
 No, no. 
 Are you sure it was this hospital? 
 Well, yes. 
 My wife left me a voicemail. I was at work. 
 She said she was bringing our 4-year-old son in. 
 He had a high fever... San Antonio Memorial. 
 I-I know what I heard. 
 She was calling from the truck while she was on the way, so... 
 A truck? 
 D-does she drive a green pickup? 
 Yeah. That's i... F-150. Why? 
 Kenny, get the chopper ready to go. 
 Call police, fire department, EMS. 
 Get T.C. and Jordan on that chopper. 
 We need everybody out there right now. 
 Wait. What... what's going on? 
 S-sir, you... you might want to sit down for this. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Your wife was in an accident, and your son may still be at the crash site. 
 Woman : All units, Route 16. 
 Possible 4-year-old child in the elements. 
 Doctors and EMS en route. 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 [Siren wails] 
 _ 
 Bet it was my brother's. 
 [Laughs] 
 He did. 
 Topher, what are you even doing here tonight? 
 I thought you had the night off. 
 I... yeah, I did. 
 I volunteered so we didn't have to use another day shifter to cover for Drew while he's in Afghanistan. 
 Oh, you are so full of it. 
 You only volunteered so you wouldn't have to spend an extra night with your mother. 
 [Snickers] 
 Okay, she's been here almost a month. 
 I'm gonna take every shift I can to get a break. 
 A month is never enough with your mother? 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 [Door closes] 
 ♪ 
 I'm asking you, will you marry me? 
 [Sobs] I love you, but I can't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hey, uh, Tee, did I... did I mention I have you and Jordan working together tonight? 
 No. No, 'cause you said we were on alternate shifts. 
 I'm sorry. The schedule... it couldn't be helped. 
 Hey, you have to rip the Band-Aid off sometime. 
 Oh, this is serious. I... 
 Stop. 
 ♪ 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 So, then, Rick e-mailed me this morning and says we now have a dog. 
 [Laughs] He's cute. 
 I'm sure he's great, but maybe you don't get a dog when I'm in Afghanistan. 
 Well, life goes on back home, Drew. 
 Your being married doesn't stop that. 
 Man : Major. 
 But I'll tell you what... 
 I will check him out when I get back in nine days. 
 Rick or the dog? 
 Nine days... don't rub it in. I've still got 104. 
 Well, please, I only have nine left because I've been for 171. 
 What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get back? 
 [Sighs] I'm gonna hug my daughter for about a week. 
 And I'm gonna take a bath for about a month, 'cause I'm a little ripe. 
 So, Shannon, this isn't anyone's favorite thing to do, but it's part of a first-year's job. 
 Now, only an M.D. can legally declare someone dead, so the retirement center brings them by. 
 You check for a pulse, then sign the death certificate. 
 Any questions? 
 No, pretty simple. 
 All right. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 We're still doing this? 
 They all have to go through it. 
 So, uh, Gwen told me you and T.C. haven't spoke for, like, two months. 
 Is that gonna be weird tonight? 
 Gwen tell you anything else you want to share? 
 No, no, I'm just gonna shut up now. 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 [Both screams] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Ow! 
 She's a feisty one. 
 Guess that's why you hired her. 
 Oh! 
 What the hell?! 
 What... what are you doing?! 
 What... what are you doing?! 
 How was that your first reaction? 
 You jumped me, man! 
 Wait, I didn't. It's a practical joke! 
 I didn't know. I just reacted! 
 Don't pull a tiger's tail if you don't want to get bit! 
 What?! 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay. 
 Kenny : Hey, no harm, no foul. 
 Everybody, I'd like to welcome our very own Dr. Shannon Rivera to the night shift. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Yeah, girl! Whoo! 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Jordan? Nasty two-car accident out on Route 16. 
 T.C. and Topher just went out in the chopper. 
 The other patient is 5 minutes out. 
 Okay, Kenny, Shannon, I need you to prep Trauma Two. 
 Paul, page Scott for a trauma consult. 
 Yep. 
 ♪ 
 Mike : Hell of a night for this, gentlemen. 
 This dry lightning is a bitch. 
 Try flying through it. 
 [Man shouts indistinctly] 
 [Siren wails] 
 What do we got, Mike? 
 First one's on her way to your hospital. 
 That's her car there. 
 Witnesses said the truck was hauling ass. 
 It flipped, threw the driver. 
 We started moving it, then we saw her neck hanging by a thread... literally. 
 Where is she? 
 There. 
 Where? 
 Right here. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Topher : Son of a bitch. 
 Stand back. Everyone back. 
 Okay, this one is me, Tee. 
 Woman :  Dr. Alexander to the ambulance bay. 
 Thank you. 
 What do we got? 
 Female, 30s, trauma to her wrists and abdomen from MVA. 
 Vitals unstable. 
 Okay. 
 How low is her pressure? 
 Not low... high. 
 Systolic is 190. 
 190? Are you sure? 
 [Moaning] It really hurts. 
 Please, you have to help her. 
 Okay, her heart's racing. 
 Let's get her inside. 
 Kelly, I'm really scared. 
 It's gonna be okay, Luce. 
 Run a trauma panel, and type and cross for four. 
 Ma'am, I promise your friend is in good hands with Dr. Alexander. 
 She's not my friend. She's my wife. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Uh, let me take a look at this cut. 
 So, what happened out there? 
 Uh, we were headed out to dinner, and some nut in a pickup truck just flew by us like 100 miles per hour, and... and we swerved. 
 Kenny, I'm gonna need a lac tray set up with 4-0 Prolene. 
 Kenny : Yep, got it. 
 Let's get you fixed up, and I promise we'll let you know everything that's going on with her. 
 Okay. 
 All right, here we go. 
 T.C. : Toph, careful! 
 Mike : You should let us get her down! 
 It's not safe for you with all this dry lightning! 
 And if you guys get hit, it'll be my ass! 
 All right, we heard you! We got this. 
 We're here to help you, ma'am. It's gonna be all right. 
 I'm Dr. Zia. That's Dr. Callahan above us. 
 Just hold still, okay? I'm gonna check you out. 
 Then we're gonna get out of here. 
 She has a strong pulse. Whoa! 
 There's a big piece of glass at the end of her SCM. 
 Be careful. If that glass shifts when we're moving her, it's gonna slice her trachea in half. 
 Yeah, copy that. 
 Throw me some Kerlix, and I'll stabilize the piece. 
 On it. You got it? 
 Here... one more. 
 [Groans] 
 ♪ 
 Damn it, there's bubbles... torn lung. 
 We're gonna have to intubate as soon as we get her down. 
 Let's get her on the backboard and get the hell out of here! 
 Get that backboard ready! 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 ♪ 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 Yeah... oop, oh! Man, I'm playing dirty now. 
 That's a kick to the nuts. 
 [Video game sound effects] 
 Are you sure you've played this before, 'cause you are really... 
 Okay, okay, wait... oh, roundhouse! 
 Thank you, elbow. 
 Blocked. You're going down. 
 I had a competition last week, and I got second. 
 You did? 
 Yeah. 
 Did Daddy film it? 
 No. 
 Well... did you do the sparring? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, now you're going down. Watch this. 
 [Distant explosions] 
 Congratulations, sweetheart. 
 That's amazing. 
 Pause, pause, pause, pause. 
 [Explosion] 
 Okay, game on. 
 Aw, come on, stop. 
 Yeah, there was a... 
 [Loud explosion] 
 What was that? 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 That was close. 
 Oh, it's nothing, sweetheart. It's just fireworks. 
 We set them off all the time. 
 So, show me your yellow belt. 
 Here, look. 
 I'm so proud of you. 
 [Explosion] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Major, we have casualties. 
 Okay. 
 Let's get them out! 
 I got to go. 
 24. 
 7. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Marquez, let's go. 
 Man : Let's go. Move! 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 [Missile whooshing] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Man #1 : Oh, my God, oh, my God! 
 Man #2 : Medic! 
 Aah! 
 My arm! 
 Medic! 
 My arm! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Shrapnel injury to the abdomen. 
 Come on, get him to the O.R.! 
 Yes, Major. Above-the-elbow amputation. 
 Let's get a tourniquet on this. Let's get him inside. 
 Drew! Over here. 
 Check for shrapnel. I'll apply the tourniquet. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 My leg... how's it look? 
 It's gonna be all right. Just a little bit of blood. 
 Yeah, a badass guy like you, it's just like a bee sting. 
 Marquez : Docs, we got local nationals coming in, hit by our counterfire. 
 You're kidding me? 
 Drew, you finish this up. I'll take the L.N. 
 [Groans] 
 Easy. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Syd : Hold up! 
 Drew : Let's get that gurney over here. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Let's go! 
 [Engine revs] 
 ♪ 
 Diffuse guarding. She needs the O.R. 
 That's why I'm here. Let's get her up. 
 Uh, there's a hitch. Her B.P. is up to... 
 Oh, now it's at 230, and her heart rate's at 140. 
 History of high blood pressure? 
 None reported, but it keeps going up, even on Nipride. 
 What do you think's going on? 
 I don't know. 
 Waiting for tox screens. 
 Well, she'll never make it through surgery with pressure that high. 
 Lab says they're short-handed and running slow. 
 No tox-screen results yet. 
 All right, just talked to the cops. 
 Witnesses say she was driving erratic, swerving all over the road. 
 Could be meth, coke? 
 Hmm. 
 She doesn't seem the type. At least, her partner doesn't. 
 Come on, Kenny, how long you been working in the E.R.? 
 Good point. 
 It could be stimulants for A.D.D. or something. 
 You know, either one would cause the elevated B.P., the heart rate, erratic driving. 
 If the labs are running slow, let's talk to her wife, see what she knows. 
 Yeah, Paul just sutured up her arm. 
 She's getting X-rays now. I'll bring her right down. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Beeping] 
 And so, Shannon, if you close a wound like I just did, you end up with a much smaller scar, if there even is a scar. 
 Maybe you can, uh, try it next time. 
 Really? Gee. Thanks. 
 Are there any available lockers? 
 Uh, Ragosa's. 
 Yeah, this one right there. 
 He's actually interning in Dallas to be closer to his kids when his wife took them. 
 Like, it's a whole thing. 
 Really great story. You should write a book. 
 You have an attitude. 
 Look who's talking. 
 You know, I'm not some wide-eyed intern you're gonna impress, and I might listen to you a little more if you didn't try to humiliate me with a practical joke on my first night. 
 Okay, okay. 
 They did it to me on my first night. 
 And I'll bet they've done it even more after that, haven't they? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Uh, n-no. How is that even relevant? 
 Well, I don't let anyone mess with me, and after they saw I punched you, no one else will mess with me, either. 
 Wait, so, y-you punched me 'cause you were scared or to send a message? 
 Okay, hey, t-this is a hospital okay... n-not a prison. 
 [Door opens] 
 Listen, I'm... I'm a doctor, right? 
 You should l-listen... to me. 
 Syd : Guys, 3... 2... 1. 
 Man #1 : Let's get bed 3 prepped for O.R. 
 Man #2 : Yes, sir. 
 [Distant explosion] 
 We know what happened? 
 She was riding in a taxi that got caught in the crossfire. 
 The driver was DOA. She wouldn't let the medics examine her. 
 [Speaking Pashto] 
 Dr. Jennings. 
 [Speaking Pashto] 
 I speak English. 
 My name is Sharbat. 
 Okay, good. Sharbat, that's a beautiful name. 
 I'm here to help you. Is there anything hurting? 
 My stomach and my chest. 
 It hurts when I breathe. 
 Okay, well, we'll check you out. 
 How old are you? 
 15. 
 Can I have my phone? I need to call my brother. 
 Uh, yeah, we'll try and track that down for you. 
 Please, I need to talk to him now. 
 I understand, but I need to treat you first, okay? 
 So, I need to get this off so I can examine you. 
 But he cannot see me. 
 Sharbat, I'll turn around. I promise. 
 I'm just here to help Dr. Jennings. 
 Sharbat, you're pregnant. 
 Do you know how many months? 
 I think around 8. 
 We're just gonna take a look at the baby. 
 Do you have a husband? 
 H-he was killed by the Taliban. 
 That's why I was leaving my village. 
 They will kill us all. 
 [Missile whooshing] 
 [Explosion] 
 You have to call my brother. 
 He's the only one that can help me. 
 Can you pause it right there? 
 Dr. Alister, can you take a look at this? 
 Does... does he... does... does he have to? 
 Please, Sharbat, I need his help to make sure you and the baby are safe. 
 You're talking... 
 Yes. 
 Sharbat, your baby is okay, but you got a small tear in your uterus from the accident. 
 We're gonna get an American baby doctor here to come and see you, but it's gonna take some time for them to get here. 
 Please, just help my baby. 
 We will, but in the meanwhile, I need to take some pictures of your chest to make sure that  you're  okay. 
 Okay. 
 Kelly : I don't understand. 
 If she needs surgery, why is she still in the E.R.? 
 We're having trouble getting her heart rate and pressure down. 
 We just saw a doctor a couple of weeks ago. Her pressure was fine. 
 W-why is it so high now? 
 Well, we were hoping maybe you could tell us. 
 Is she taking any medication for A.D.D., narcolepsy? 
 No. 
 Any chance she was using drugs... meth, cocaine? 
 No. God, no. She's completely healthy. 
 Lucia won't even take an aspirin. 
 She's strictly vegan. 
 Are you sure? 
 Witnesses said she was driving erratically. 
 She's not on anything. 
 I know my wife. 
 We're not suggesting that you don't, but any information that you have could help save her. 
 Shannon, can you pull the... 
 Ultrasound? 
 Thank you. 
 Kelly : What... what are you doing? 
 Now we need to monitor the bleeding in her kidney. 
 [Beeping] 
 Paul, thoughts? 
 Bleeding is stable. That's good. 
 Any sicknesses lately... uh, flu? 
 Uh, no, not really. 
 Oh, she's complained of headaches, hot flashes, dizziness, but the doctor just said, "Welcome to menopause." 
 Was the doctor a man? 
 Yeah, he is. 
 [Monitor beeping erratically] 
 Jordan : She's in V-Fib. Shannon, paddles. 
 Oh, my God. What's happening?! 
 Nurse. 
 Why... what are you... 
 Kelly : Oh, my God, help her! You have to do something! 
 What's going on?! 
 It's okay, ma'am. 
 Nurse : Please, we need you to step outside. 
 No. 
 Okay, clear. 
 Clear. - Clear. 
 Please. 
 [Paddles thump] 
 [Flatline] 
 Still V-fib. All right, charge. 
 [Beeping, whirring] 
 We clear? - Clear. 
 Clear. 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 Topher : Okay, sounds good. 
 You're in on the left. 
 Okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 Aw. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I just tweaked my shoulder a little bit. 
 Got to say, it's good to have you back out here with me, buddy. 
 Yeah, it feels good to be back. 
 Yeah. 
 I get so bored being charge doc, you know? 
 I spend half the night sitting behind that desk. 
 Why can't I go out sometimes? 
 You know you can go out whenever you want. 
 You're the boss. 
 Damn right. Yeah. 
 I want to get back to who I used to be, instead of this house cat I turned into. 
 Besides, who knows when I can send you and Jordan out together again, right? 
 Yeah, probably best to wait on that. 
 Things are still a little raw. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Crap, Toph, Toph, Toph. 
 The pressure's dropping, the pressure's dropping. 
 She's bleeding out. 
 Toph, we got to pull that glass. 
 Oh, is that all? 
 Yeah. 
 Surgery in a flying earthquake. 
 Okay, look... if you pull the glass, I'll find the bleeder and clamp it off. 
 All right, let's use the NOD this time. 
 It's hard enough to intubate. 
 Okay. 
 We'll never see that bleeder without it. 
 Got it? 
 Clamp? 
 Wait. Got it. 
 Pull it out nice and slow, buddy. 
 Yeah. Okay, that's the plan. 
 Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 God. 
 Look at that thing. 
 It's like an iceberg. 
 Lucky it didn't take her head off. 
 Okay, I see the bleeder. 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 Aah! Jesus! Son of... 
 What? 
 I got... I got whited out by lightning. 
 Great, so you're blind now, too? 
 No, I got this. 
 Just be steady. 
 I'm close, close. [Chuckles] 
 The point. 
 Got it. 
 Bleeding stopped. 
 Okay, pressure's coming back up. Nice job. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hold compressions. 
 I have a pulse. 
 We're in sinus. 
 Shannon : B.P. and heart rate are coming down. 
 What do you think caused the V-fib? 
 [Beeping] 
 It was the F.A.S.T. scan. 
 Right. 
 What do you mean? 
 Scott : When Dr. Alexander ran the ultrasound probe over the kidney, the heart rate and the B.P. shot up. 
 Jordan : Like this. 
 [Rapid beeping] 
 Now look here. 
 Above the kidney, what do you see? 
 A pheochromocytoma... tumor of the adrenal gland. 
 Paul, I was asking Shannon. I know you know. 
 And I knew that. 
 [Scoffs] 
 What the hell is your problem, man? 
 What the hell is your problem? 
 You got to be the big man. 
 Like, all day, I've been trying to be nice. 
 Is it 'cause I'm a girl? 
 Then, like, you just... 
 Hey, hey, hey, the patient. 
 It must have gotten crushed in the accident and released adrenaline into her bloodstream. 
 Yeah, and every time we pushed on it, it had the same effect. 
 So, it needs to come out. Let the O.R. know we're coming. 
 Not so fast. 
 Operating on it can release a fatal dose of hormones into her system. 
 So, Shannon, what do we do? 
 Put her on alpha and beta blockers for the next few days until it's safe to go into surgery. 
 Exactly. 
 And hope she doesn't start bleeding again. 
 Major! Captain! 
 Major, Captain, new development! 
 Her husband is here for her. 
 What? Her husband? 
 Sharbat, what is going on? 
 I thought he was dead. 
 Where is she?! 
 Marquez : He's got to be somebody important, 'cause he walked right through security. 
 What are you doing to my wife? 
 You can't just walk in here. 
 You got to get out. 
 Yes, I can. 
 No, you can't. 
 Get away from her! 
 You're a man! You cannot look at her! 
 We are saving her life! 
 I think that supercedes those rules! 
 Get away from her. 
 Drew! 
 I'm not leaving! 
 Get away! 
 Drew, stand down! 
 I have got it from here. Leave now. 
 That is an order! 
 ♪ 
 Listen to her. 
 He should have never been here. 
 I'm sorry, sir. There was an emergency. 
 Your wife was in an accident. 
 There's been some bleeding around the heart that I'm draining now. 
 There also seems to have been an issue with the baby. 
 Then she needs a midwife. I'm taking her. 
 [Sighs] She can't go now. 
 She's been sedated, and she is too sick for a midwife. 
 Her uterus has a small tear. 
 So far, the baby is okay, but we have called in a specialist. 
 I make decisions for my wife, not you. 
 She needs medical attention. 
 You are guests in our country. 
 She's my property, and I'm taking her! 
 [Speaking Pashto] 
 This may be your country, but right now she is my patient. 
 You've got a problem, you file a complaint. 
 Until then, get out of my E.R. 
 Ah, you will pay for this. 
 [Shouting in Pashto] 
 [Sighs] 
 I thank you. 
 You see? 
 Please, don't let him take me. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 42-year-old female, deep lacerations to her neck causing a tracheobronchial injury. 
 I had to clamp off her pulmonary vein. 
 E.T. tube's in the left main bronchus. 
 Sats and B.P. are stable. 
 Not bad for in the field. 
 We got it from here. 
 [Groans] 
 Hey, need me to massage that shoulder, old man? 
 No, I'm good. It's just... It's just sore. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 What is this? 
 10 bucks says it's Janet complaining about your mother? 
 Oh, yeah? Yeah? Okay. 
 Well, you owe me $10 'cause it's my mother complaining about Janet. 
 Hi, Mom. Miss you. 
 O-okay. Can you speak English? 
 'Cause I can't understand you when you talk this fast. 
 [Chuckles] 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Do you, uh, want to... 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 So, I heard there was a bit of a situation out there. 
 Yeah. 
 I know you're not the biggest fan of lightning. 
 But, you know, you don't have a choice, right? 
 Uh, S-Scott has her now. 
 So, how... how's the other patient... the driver? 
 She went into V-fib arrest. 
 Oh. 
 Pretty sure she has a bleeding pheo. 
 Wow, that's not good. 
 So, listen, I, uh, want to... 
 Let's talk outside. 
 Yep. 
 Look, I just don't want it to be awkward for us working together, for you. 
 I don't want it to be awkward for you, either, but I don't see... I don't see how... 
 Let's get him inside. 
 ...it's not going to be. 
 I mean, you'll figure it out, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I think the best thing we could do is just face it, and eventually, we'll get over it, right? 
 That sounds like you're not thinking about going back to the day shift. 
 Why would I... Why? 
 I... I love the night shift. 
 Uh, do you want to transfer to the day shift? 
 [Chuckling] No. 
 I mean, it might be easier for you. 
 [Chuckling] Oh. 
 I mean, you said you were considering it anyway. 
 Um, no. No, I didn't. 
 You suggested it when we broke up, but I never said that I was going to. 
 Yes, you did. 
 No, I didn't. No, I didn't. 
 You... you... you said it. 
 Okay... 
 Woman : Hey, need the room. 
 That's the thing... you don't listen. 
 I... well... 
 All right, you just get an idea in your head of what you want to happen... 
 Okay, okay. 
 ...and then you just expect it to. 
 I'm not the only one... I'm not the only one who does that. 
 Meaning? 
 Like... like when I asked you could I go to Afghanistan, and you said, "Sure." 
 And then I went and came back, you were pissed at me. 
 I never said go. 
 Yes, you did. 
 No, I didn't. 
 I said that I wasn't gonna stop you, because you would resent me if I did. 
 That's the same thing. 
 No, it's not. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, well, T.C., did I want you to go? No. 
 What pregnant woman wants to send the father of her child into a war zone? 
 Then why not just say that? 
 You would have gone anyway. 
 Mollie : Excuse me, doctors. 
 Jordan, your patient's new CBC is back. 
 The lab says to call them ASAP. 
 Excuse me. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Give it some time, honey. 
 She just needs time. 
 Thank you. 
 [Suction whooshing] 
 Got to say, for a woman who was ejected out of her truck onto a freeway sign, she's doing pretty well. 
 She's very lucky she had such a great surgeon. 
 Yeah, you were awesome. 
 I was talking about you, Paul. 
 Really nice assist here. 
 Like I said, you've got the gift. 
 All done with the sutures? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, let's go take a look at the film, make sure there weren't any issues with her other lung before we close her up. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Hey. 
 What's going on with you and this new intern, Shannon? 
 She's very annoying, and she thinks she knows way more than she actually does. 
 So did you, if I remember correctly. 
 But from her work at the reservation clinic, she's coming in with way more experience than most first-years. 
 But the bigger issue is if she's gonna rattle you like that, what's gonna happen to you when things go south in here? 
 Well, it's totally different. 
 How? 
 [Sighs] I'm in control here. 
 I'm in control in the big stuff like my hand. 
 I almost lost everything, but I took it like a man. 
 [Sighs] 
 I did the rehab, and I'm here. 
 That's true, you did. 
 Right, but the social stuff never... been the best at. 
 You know, like, uh, I've always been the smartest guy in the room. 
 I mean, not to say that I'm the smartest guy in  this  room. 
 Okay, look, Paul. Paul, listen to me. 
 You're very smart. 
 I need you to have the same confidence out there, when you're dealing with your bosses and your ex-colleagues and everyone else that you have in here with your surgeries. 
 A night shift at a busy trauma center like this is the Wild West, and we are the calm in the eye of the storm. 
 You know, we make it all okay for everyone. 
 You get it? 
 Right. 
 Scott, I need you. 
 Next up. [Sighs] 
 Okay, Paul, finish the repair and close. 
 Okay. 
 6-0 Prolene on a needle driver, please. 
 The repeat blood test shows that her blood count is dropping, which means that her tumor is probably bleeding again. 
 So, can't you just fix it? 
 It's not that simple. 
 Normally, we premedicate someone for a couple of weeks with adrenaline-blocking medication before operating, but with her bleeding again, we have to go in. 
 But you should know there are serious risks taking it out now, but the risks are far more serious if we don't. 
 Are you telling me she could die? 
 We're telling you it's complicated. 
 Then uncomplicate it for me. 
 I wish we could, but we can't. 
 Now, it's risky, but this is her best chance. 
 We weren't even supposed to go out tonight, but I-I pushed her because I wanted to. 
 You know, maybe if we had just stayed home, this wouldn't have happened... 
 Okay, whoa, whoa. 
 ...or we wouldn't have crashed. 
 Kelly, this is not your fault, okay? 
 Sometimes bad things happen to good people. 
 It is my fault. 
 We've been fighting so much lately, and in the car, I got so mad, I asked her for a separation. 
 And she was so upset... 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 Okay, all right, all right, um, why don't we get some coffee. 
 If we move her, she doesn't make it... neither does the baby. 
 I'm just telling you what our orders are. 
 I didn't say that I agreed with them. 
 So we're just gonna kowtow to this b*st*rd who calls this little girl his property? 
 Back in the States, he's in jail for statutory rape. 
 Yeah, and you don't think it pisses me off? 
 I've got a daughter two years younger than her.

 This country is like stepping into the Bible.

 Yeah, back there, we'd figure out a way to help her. 
 Sharbat, how are you feeling? 
 The baby? 
 He's fine. 
 He? It's a boy? 
 Yes.

 Sharbat, I need... I need you to talk to me about your husband. 
 I'm sorry I lied. 
 I just... I didn't want you to contact him. 
 I didn't want him to find me. 
 He wants to take you back to the village. 
 No, no. 
 We can delay it. 
 I don't know what else there is we... 
 You don't know how cruel he is. 
 You don't know how cruel his family is to me. 
 I was sold to him at 13 by my parents. 
 I hate this country. 
 He doesn't care about me. 
 He only wants his baby boy. 
 My brother is trying to help me. 
 He made enough money to go to Australia. 
 You have to find him. 
 We are trying, but it's tricky for us because your husband is right about one thing. 
 We have to follow Afghan laws.

 The accident is not why she's in surgery. 
 It's the adrenal tumor. 
 It's a... it's like a time bomb inside of her, and it could have happened anytime, anywhere, so that has nothing to do with you. 
 I just got so tired of the arguing. 
 All right, look, uh... I know that you and I don't know each other, but do you mind if I ask... has the fighting just been this past couple of months, you know, where she's been irritable, she's had angry outbursts? 
 Yeah, that's it. She's just been so angry at me. 
 Okay, well, those are all, you know, symptoms of adrenaline leaking from the tumor. 
 Oh, my God.
