 T.C. : That was a brutal workout. 
 I've not been hit that hard in a long time. 
 It was great for me. 
 I can never kick your ass enough. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Oh Jordan. 
 What? 
 This is "Smalls," A.K.A. Colonel Elwood Green, my group therapy, MMA leader/torturer. 
 Oh, hi. 
 This... this is Jordan. 
 Whoa. How'd you end up with him? 
 [Chuckles] He got lucky, I guess. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Jordan! 
 Yeah. 
 I was looking for you. 
 You have a call. 
 It was nice to meet you. 
 Topher : Smalls, Skype video call is ready. 
 Showtime. 
 All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 What's this all about? 
 I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. 
 A little patience, Callahan. 
 Jordan! 
 [Phone hangs up] 
 Hey. What do we got? 
 9-year-old boy... Ethan. He has a temperature of 101. 
 He is burning up. 
 I'm very concerned about his fever. 
 It hasn't gone down. 
 Mrs. Edwards, this is Dr. Alexander. 
 So, he's fine one minute, and then the next, it's... 
 Okay. 
 You need to help him. 
 Okay, we  are  gonna examine Ethan, but just so that you know, it's very common for children to have fevers. 
 He probably just has a-a-a virus or something. 
 I am not concerned about other people's children. 
 I'm concerned about mine, so please tend to him. 
 Paul, hi, there. 
 Uh, would you take this young man into pedes, please? 
 Uh, sure. What seems to be the issue? 
 He has a raging fever of 101. 
 I will be with you shortly. 
 Okay, in the meantime, I'm gonna need you to fill out some paperwork with one of our nurses here. 
 Uh, Mollie, could you help Mrs. Edwards, please? 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Follow me, ma'am, please. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 911 for a fever? 
 You should have seen her back at their house. 
 I told her, "this is not why you call 911." 
 But she was not having it. She's a helicopter mom, so I figured I'd just save another crew a trip, you know? 
 Full moon, right? 
 [Laughing] Right. 
 Okay, catch you later. 
 Topher : All right, everybody, we just have a few moments for this, but Smalls has a big surprise for us. 
 I wanted to thank all of you for the volunteer work you've been doing on the Mobile Vet Centers, but I got outranked. 
 There's somebody else here today that would like to do that. 
 It's all yours, ladies. 
 Hey, thank you, Smalls. 
 Well, hello, San Antonio Memorial night shift. 
 How are you guys doing? [Cheering and whooping] Well, I know you all are busy and about to stat your shift, but Jill and I wanted to personally thank you for everything you're doing to serve this community. Just from a show of hands, how many of you are veterans or married to veterans? Oh, great. Outstanding. A-and by the way, we heard from Smalls about the terrific work you're doing with our veterans. Let me tell you, we're grateful to you for encouraging your veteran patients and their families to go to Vet Centers. We're so glad that, if they need it, the San Antonio Veteran Community can get the free counseling and support they have earned. We're big believers in counseling and know how much it can help. Well, we're both so proud of all of you for being a driving force behind this work. So thanks again. Keep up the great work. And now we're gonna let you get started with your shift. Together : Thank you.  All right, guy, take it easy. [Applause] T.C., there's been an accident at a construction site. They need you there stat. On it. Thanks for arranging that. It's a huge thrill. Yeah. And thanks for helping T.C. in group. It's made a big difference for him. You know, he still has some things to work through, but he'll get there. Yeah. Right, okay, so, your fever still hasn't broken, so we're gonna give you some more, uh... But where's my mom? Well, she's with Dr. Alexander. I want to see her now. Okay, Ethan, it's all right. It's not all right. I  need  to see her. Okay, yeah, I'll... I'll bring her to you, okay? But listen... I need you to I need you to pee for me... I told you. I don't have to go! I want my mom! Uh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Hey. So, Scott is still on leave, huh? Yeah, at least another day. Family's getting ready to Sue him. And to make matters worse, it looks like the D.A. is considering to charge him with reckless driving. I just talked to him, and he's a total mess. He feels terrible about the kid. I just examined a teenager who was wearing a necklace made of squirrel parts. [Laughs] He had it all chained together as a necklace, wanted to know if it would give him AIDS. That's kind of freaky, huh? I don't know. On a Full-moon Saturday night? I mean, that's nothing. It's gonna get a lot freakier tonight. Yeah, that might be the most conventional thing you see all night, by the way. Yeah, but I thought all this full-moon, crazy stuff... I don't care what the research says, okay? My experience tells me it's gonna get nuts in here. It sounds like we have the makings of a bet tonight. Okay, how about this? You three, 100 bucks a pop, weirdest case, winner takes all? All right. All right. Yeah. Cool? Okay, okay, okay! All right, I'm the judge. Weirdest case, 10 points, 1 point for the least. Whoever has the weirdest case by the morning takes the pot and bragging rights. Deal? Okay. Deal. Deal. Good luck to you all. You the doc? Yeah. What do we got? The lift collapsed the scaffolding and landed on Carlos. All right. The paramedics just took him away. Walt tried to get to him, but he's pinned under the pipes. [Walt groaning] Okay, I'm Dr. Callahan. I'm gonna take care of you. How's Carlos? Is he okay? Serious. He's being transferred to the hospital. Okay. Aah! Hold still. Hold still. No, I-I tried... I tried to help him, but the scaffolding was all over... I'm sure you did. You know, the look on his face when it started falling on him... I tried to get to him. I'm sure you did whatever you could. Look, we got to get this thing off. You boys ready? Okay. Come on. [Men straining] Ohh! Ohh! Ohh. Here we go. Okay. Hey, it could have been much worse, all right? Okay, we got an open fracture and a dislocated ankle. All right, I got to reset the ankle, get the blood flow back into the foot. If I don't, you could lose it. Do what you got to do. Okay. I'm gonna give you some pain meds. Uh, no, don't. I can't have any. You in recovery? No. I'm on parole. If I put anything in my system, they're gonna send me back. Hey, it's... it's cool. I'll call your parole officer, no problem. Yeah, and if you forget, I'm back in the joint. Like I said, you just do whatever you got to do. Okay. Your call. All right. You ready for this? On "three." One, three. Ohh! There we go. [Groans] You're good. ♪♪♪ I'm telling you, he is perfectly fine one minute, and then the next he is burning up. All right, well, we're gonna run some tests, and we are starting him on fluids. I'm actually feeling better, mom. His temp is still hovering around 101. Well, that's not better. That's the same. And, baby, you may think you're feeling better, but you're not. Ethan, can you tell us where else you're feeling some discomfort? Kind of feel like I have a... He's got headaches. He also has this sort of sweating that's happening, and then it... Mrs. Edwards, I think it would be best if Ethan could answer these questions. Well, he tells me everything, and I really don't want to t-tax... Mom! Oh! Oh, my gosh! Ugh! Are you all right? Oh. Oh. Let's get you seated. Are you okay, mom? Okay. I'm all right. Sh-she'll be fine. Mrs. Edwards, I'm just gonna... ♪♪♪ Male, 40s, ankle fracture. Gonna take him to Trauma 2. Where's Carlos? How's he doing? You got to find out for me. Kenny? Sorry, brother. He didn't make it. Ah! Dr. Zia's talking to his wife now. Lois, I-I tried to do everything to help him. I did! I tried! You got to explain it to her. I tried to help him. I was there. Okay. I didn't want to talk in front of Ethan, but I'm very, very sorry that we got off on the wrong foot. That's okay. Look, Mrs. Edwards, um, is there something going on that I should know about? No. [Chuckles nervously] Well, there's always something going on with me. I just have a very high-stress, very high-strung personality. And my doctor has me on Xanax, and I've been trying to get off of it. So, I guess, lesson learned. [Chuckles] Well, that shouldn't cause fainting, so... Well, I didn't faint, actually. I was dizzy, and I lost my balance. Um... I have vertigo. So, I was in a car accident several years ago, and it's one of the residual effects, that and the eye thing. Okay. I'm just a bit of a mess. Look, thank you for telling me all that. Now, you took a pretty big shot, so I would like to get a scan of your head. No. No. God, no. Um, I'm fine, but if you would just look after my son. Dr. Cummings is gonna run all the tests on Ethan, and we will get his fever down and I... Okay. I am just gonna e-mail my husband first because he's on a plane and he touches down in 90 minutes... It's okay. Take your time, all right? Okay. Thank you. [Sighs] Man, I can't believe Carlos is dead. It's not right. Were you guys close? Gonna be. Met him month and a half ago at church. He got me the job, really stuck his neck out for me, 'cause I can tell you... most places they don't want to take on no ex-cons. I can imagine. How long were you in for? 16 years. Just got out 3 months ago. And I didn't kill anybody, if that's what you're wondering. I wasn't. Yeah. A lot of people do wonder. They get scared when they find out that somebody's been to prison, think I'm some kind of killer. Excuse me, Tee. When you have a second? Hey, weren't you Carlos' doctor? Uh, yes, sir. I was. So, did he suffer? I-I'm sorry, sir. He... he was D.O.A. at the site. We... we did everything we could. Would you like to talk to his wife... Lois? 'Cause she's still here. No. I'm sorry? I said no! I don't want to talk to her, okay? She just lost her husband. So, I'm sorry, but I j... Can you just give me a minute? Of course. ♪♪♪ The reason I came in... Ali's been moved up the transplant list. The Embassy in Kabul has his VISA, so I'm gonna Skype him later and let him know. That's great. Yeah. So, it looks like I'm gonna go sooner than expected, maybe about a week. Topher, I will go with you if you want. Just say the word. I know. I know you would. Jordan would kill both of us. She's already yelling at me for going. Ali saved your life. There's only one way you can pay him back. I know. Well, wives and pregnant girlfriends don't always understand that. No. [Chuckles] I'll go get Ali. Be back before you know it. Okay. All right. [Indistinct speaking over P.A.] Wait. What is it, a tumor? No. Fortunately. Some knucklehead teen had a contest to see how many sunflower seeds he could eat. So, 10 days later, ix-nay on the poo-pay. No bowel movement, so his parents brought him in. Not bad. Please. I just pulled a cockroach out of a patient's ear. Who cares? That's nothing. Oh, then he  ate  it. Now, that's something. Yes. Okay, uh, let's see... 6 points for Krista... Oh! ... 5 1/2 for Drew. My good friend Ragosa is still in the lead with 6 1/2 with the squirrel necklace, my friends. I should get more points. Me too. I have ruled. Move on to your next patients. All right, his pressure dropped, he became altered and completely soaked himself. [Monitor beeping rapidly] He's septic. Hang a gram of Ceftriaxone and bolus 300 cc of saline. His weight count is 19,000. What did his chest and urinalysis say? His chest X-ray is clear, but we didn't do a urine. He wouldn't pee. Wouldn't or couldn't? He said he didn't have to. I-I gave him fluids to help. Look, Walt, uh... I think you may need surgery. Surgery? Mm-hmm. I can't have surgery. I have to work. I want to go back to work tomorrow. Well, that's not gonna happen 'cause you're gonna be on crutches. No, you don't understand. You know, I can't be off that long. I'll lose my job. Everything hinges on that job. Well, look, you got workmen's comp or something to help you get by, right? I'm not talking about getting by. I'm saving up so I can send my boy some money for college. He's graduating high school in a month, and I need to show him that I've changed. Walt... No, Doc! This is not gonna happen. I'm not having surgery. I'm just gonna limp along. Let's just run the test, and then we can... No. Ow! Damn! Aah! It just gave out on me. Yeah, I told you, your ankle's barely hanging onto your leg. I'm not talking about  that  leg. I'm talking about the other one, my good one! It just gave out on me. Said your good one? Yeah. Do you feel this? No. Okay. What... what about this? No, nothing. I can't feel anything. I can't stand up on it. Now, what the hell is going on? ♪♪♪ [Monitor beeping] I-I'm sorry. Come here. I got you. I got you. I'm sorry. Please don't tell my mom I wet myself. I-I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Ethan, no one's gonna be mad at you, all right? It's okay. But my mom will get upset, and she doesn't handle that well. Just curious... what does your mom do when she gets upset? She just... I don't want to talk about it. I-I'm tired and I don't feel well. This doesn't sound good. No. It doesn't. Look, I need to talk to the mother. I'm getting a picture here I don't like. What about the leg weakness? When was the first time you noticed that? Is it new, or is it the same as the hand weakness? Hey, man, I can't help you if you don't tell me. Tonight was the first time. Okay. So, just now? No. If I told you something, we still have doctor-patient confidentiality, right? Yeah, of course, 100%. Carlos and I were always playing around, you know? Sure. We were friends. And I stepped in front of him just as a joke as he was driving by. And I was just kidding around. And... I tried to move, and I couldn't. And my legs were stuck in cement. It was like I fell down and he swerved to avoid me... [Voice breaking] And he ran into the scaffolding. I killed him! I can't help but believe that I'm the only one who's responsible for killing my best friend. [Cries] ♪♪♪ Jordan : Okay, so, you're sure there's no evidence of an obstructing stone? Yeah. The renal ultrasound shows the hydronephrosis, but no reflux or stone. [Sighs] Um, have you talked to the mom about why Ethan's so afraid of her? No. She went to meet her husband... [elevator bell dings] Um... Actually, here they are. Hi. David : Good evening, Doctors. I'm David. I'm Ethan's fa... They said that the antibiotics would help, so why is he getting worse? Baby. Look, I'm sorry. I just took a cab straight here. Can you catch me up? Yes. We think that Ethan has a kidney infection due to a blockage, but he doesn't have any of the common causes, so we have him on potent antibiotics. Which take some time... You said that hours ago. Okay. Paul, why don't you take Mrs. Edwards in to see Ethan? I think he would like that. All right, sure. This way, please. Yes. And I'll fill you in. Okay, we need to talk about your wife. All right, so, Ragosa is still ahead. It's been a bit of a slow night, but I'm sure things will pick up after the bars close. Well, they better because, um, we're not losing to the noob. Yeah, that's a fact, Jack. You understand? You will not win. Mm-hmm. You two are feeling a little confident, huh? Yeah. Okay. How about a little side wager? Bring it on. Last place finisher washes the other two's cars. Deal. Deal. Fine. Fine. Pbht! A little spit shine will be nice. Thank you. Thank you. You know, whatever happened out there with your leg, you couldn't control that. I shouldn't have been messing around. Hey, he was playing around, too. You said you guys did it all the time. So it wasn't your fault. Well, you're a smart man, Doc, but unless you ever felt responsible for getting someone killed... Well, I have. Here? No. Afghanistan. Someone close? Yeah, very. You don't like talking about it? Nope. In my group. Oh, good for you. Yep. I thought therapy was B.S., bunch of guys sitting around whining. I mean, I thought it was weak. Yeah. Me too. I was wrong. You know what I learned listening to all those stories about who's the toughest and the baddest? That you weren't the toughest and the baddest? Exactly. I thought I was tough. I wasn't tough. I was a coward. I took the easy road. You know what kind of man I am? No. The kind who would walk out on his kid. You got any? No, not yet. Well, when you do, don't mess it up. I wan't. I mean, you got to be there for them. Hey. I will. Yeah, easier said than done. Life can pull you in ways you wouldn't even expect. Ow! Your ankle hurting again? Yeah, a bit. I'll get you some ibuprofen. Here, take this. Help you with the pain. Mm. [Gags] Hey. You okay? Sorry. I was having a problem swallowing. That h-happens sometimes. It's not the first time, right? You have this with food, too? Yeah. I mean, no, it's not the first time, and, yeah, sometimes with food. Is that bad? Ali? Ali, can you see or hear me? I'm losing you. [  Weakly ]  Yeah, Topher, I can... I can hear you. [Chuckles]  Let me adjust my device. Okay. [  Breathing heavily ] A-Ali, w-what's been happening? I-I haven't been feeling well lately. I might have a cold or... or flu. Yeah, okay. Listen, I-I'm gonna get back to you tomorrow with... with all the details of your trip, and I'm gonna give the aid worker a list of some meds to get for you so you can feel a lot better, okay? Okay. Thank you, Topher. I c... I can't wait to see you, Ali, in Dubai. Me too. I miss you. Yeah. Take care, okay? Okay. Goodbye. [Computer powers down] So, that was Ali. Yeah. Yeah. He didn't look too good, Tophe. You think he's gonna make it to Dubai? You know, not... not without an LVAD to bridge him to a transplant. If he doesn't get that, he's not... he's not gonna make it. He didn't realize. ♪♪♪ Okay. So, look, I think that Walt's issue could be neuro. It could be from the pipe falling on him 'cause he took a pretty good bruising on his spine. Could be a pre-existing problem, too. Try a nerve conduction test and get a baseline to see if the wiring in his nervous system's working. [Sighs] Yeah, yeah, good idea. After being in prison that long, he could have all sorts of issues that were never addressed. Yeah. He's had a pretty messed-up life, but, you know, I got to give him credit. He owns all his dumb decisions. Hey, did... did smalls get back to you about whether they can get Ali to Kabul or to an American base? 'Cause he is pretty well-connected with the security firms. Uh, he's making calls, but I-I-I got to say, I'm... I'm freaking out here 'cause Ali's running out of time. You should have seen him... did not look good. Tophe, we'll just keep working our contacts. I know. We both got calls and e-mails to Joey. Maybe he can get a doctors without borders team in there. Your lips to God's ears. I got to go. My patient's in the bay. Yeah, she's flighty, but that's all. There is no way that she would... Okay. [Sighs] Okay, but he was legitimately afraid of her finding out. Well, that is probably because of the bed-wetting issue. The bed-wetting issue? Okay, she didn't mention anything about that. [Sighs] Yeah, it's... you know, it's sort of a thing between them. You know, she... she takes it personally because she can't just solve it. Well, it doesn't exactly work like that. And then she gets upset because feels like a failure, and it's like a cycle. She's been to therapists about it. Yeah, she did mention that she was taking some medication. She's trying. She really is. But the... the shrink... he says that the... the right medication is an art, not a science. Yeah. You know, I just... I travel so much for my job that I'm not there a lot, and I-I-I-I don't really know everything that goes on. Okay. Okay, Mr. Edwards, thank you for filling in some of the blanks. And, look, we will get to the bottom of Ethan's medical problems, okay? Thank you. Whoa. Oh. Um, sir, I just need my colleagues to confirm my diagnosis. So, this gentleman attempted to impress his girlfriend by kissing a rattlesnake on the lips. Now, rattlesnake envenomation occurs in 75% of all rattlesnake bites, which means, sir, you are very lucky to be alive. Would you gentlemen concur? We concur. Yeah. I thought you might. And if I were you, I'd get yourself a new girlfriend. That's my advice. [Sighs] We have a new leader. That's definitely an 8.5. Hey, and with Drew's werewolf last hour, that puts you in last place, Michael. [Sighs] Ooh! I'm gonna get my truck extra dirty for you. Oh. My neighbor's got triplets. I'm gonna let them eat chocolate in the front seat all day. Mm-hmm. Have fun with that. Oh, man. Uh, h-hold on a second. Yo? I got, uh, $40 for the next crazy patient. [Knock on door] Hey. So, what is it? I can tell on your face it ain't good. It's not great. Um, based off the results of your EMG and, uh, the numbness in your legs, the weakness in your hands, and difficulty swallowing and... Just say it, would you? You have A.L.S. Whoa. [Scoffs] What? It's that ice-bucket thing? Yes, the ice-bucket thing. So I'm gonna be laid up like this for the rest of my life? I'm not gonna be able to work? The thing is, Walt, with A.L.S., once the symptoms start, the life expectancy is maybe one to two years, and based off your symptoms, you've probably had it a while. [Breathes deeply] I'm sorry. I don't understand. I can feel my leg now. Look, I can move it. No, I... So, just like maybe what you said... I, um, hurt my spine in the fall or something? Look, I-I wish it was, but, um... look, I-I consulted a neurologist. We reviewed the tests. He concurred. You have A.L.S. So I was right. Carlos died because of me, because I couldn't move. No. Hey, hey, hey, Walt, you couldn't help that. Oh, yeah, I couldn't help anything, can I? All I wanted was to work, make money for my boy. The truth is, I was thinking about going up there to see him... Graduate. Maybe you can still do that. Yeah, and show up empty-handed after all these years. Yeah, that would make a great impression. I should have swallowed my pride and told that boy every chance I had how much I loved him. I didn't do that. And I blew it. Now... I'm never gonna be able to get that back. 
 
 Incoming! Is this the one? Yep, yep, yep, yep. What happened? Don't even try and guess 'cause you never will. It's all yours, Michael. Why don't you go ahead and take a look? Whoa. Yeah. Male and female, both 30s. She just got cosmetic braces and wanted to try them out on her boyfriend, as it were, and let's just say something got caught between the tracks. [Woman mutters] Ouch! Stop talking! [Moans] It hurts like crazy when she tries to talk. Look... just help me, please. I'm begging you. And... and... and... and this would put me in the lead? This definitely puts you in the lead. Mollie! Get me a needle, please. Did you ju... are you kidding me? You gave that to him? Sorry, man. You were not around. Ohh! Looks like you're in last place. Not looking good for the home team. Hey, you give me the next crazy patient, and I'll give you 20 bucks of my winnings. Why are you whispering? Because I just offered you 30 bucks to throw me a solid. Yeah, you're right. $50 is a lot of money to be advertising to everyone. What?! Dude, that's cash money up front. [Grunts] Have you no morals? You better be taking me out with all that cash you're earning. Why do you think I'm doing it? [Chuckling] To mess with the doctors. Okay, maybe, maybe. [Laughs] But I'm still gonna take you out. Then I'm gonna take you down. Oh. Thanks for the heads-up on the braces. Anything for my man. Hey, uh, whatever happened to that kid that I brought in with the fever? Oh, yeah, that's gotten complicated. I think the mom may be behind it somehow. Come on. I'll walk you over. Yeah. [Cellphone dings] Oh, got it... 8:00 dinner reservations Saturday night. Only me and you. All right. Wine me, dine me, then be my dessert? [Chuckles] You drive a hard bargain. [Laughs] On it! Kenny, call security! Code Gray! Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?! Let go of me! Come on! He was hurting her! I saw the whole thing! No. No. What are you talking about? Who are you? What?! You had her pinned against the wall! No, no, no, no, no. He was grabbing me, holding me up so I didn't hit the floor. She was dizzy. She was about to fall! I was helping her. Kenny, help. He saw the whole thing. I'm sorry. I was looking at my phone. Kenny! I'm... Babe, I'm... Hey, you know what? G-get her away from me. Jordan : Okay. Okay, Gwen, stand down. Back away. Mr. Edwards, I apologize. She's been under a lot of stress lately. Ah, fine, whatever. Just... just keep her away from us, please. Yes. And look after our son. Okay. Take a walk, Gwen. Gwen, come on. Come on. I s... I swear I saw him. [Indistinct conversations] Gwen, just listen to me. Lisa has vertigo, okay? She fell earlier tonight. I-I had to grab her, too. I saw the look on her face. She is scared of him. Gwen... And when he grabbed her before, he was pushing her! He wasn't holding her! No one else saw that. Because no one was there. Why do you think he picked that moment? And Kenny? Kenny wasn't looking. God, Jordan, listen to me! I  know  what I saw. Don't you think I know an abuser when I see one? [Scoffs] Gwen, you are my best friend. Okay? You are my family, and I love you, but you and I both know that you have a history of jumping the gun. And if the hospital knew that, you... you could be out of a job. He's abusing her. I've never been more sure in my life. Sweetie, listen to me. Listen, I have already called legal and protective services for Ethan, okay? Hopefully they can talk to him and get some more answers, but we have to follow protocol on this. I Have... Topher, I'm sorry. I could have handled it better. Yeah, you think? [Sighs] Legal is all up my butt. They're gonna call your boss, and that... that dad is some kind of suit, so you  know  the trouble that he's gonna make. No. He knows that I know what he's up to. He knows... Okay, Gwen... Gwen! We're gonna talk about this later when cooler heads prevail. In the meantime, I'm gonna have to ask you to go home. Topher, there's a call for you at the admit desk. See that? It's... it's hitting the fan already! Just... just take a message for now. No. It's about Ali. I'm s... it's long distance Dr. Chavez. [Door closes] Jordan : Gwen, I... Get out. Get out. I don't want to look at you right now. Get out! ♪♪♪ Jordan : Hey, I heard you were up here. Oh, hey. Hey. Thanks. Yeah. It's a hell of a night, huh? You too? Yeah, I got a... a kid with kidney failure in the middle of a family drama. Uh, there's a mother who may or may not be emotionally or physically abusing him. And Gwen just jumped the father, thinking that he is abusing the mother. She did that? Yeah. Yeah, Topher had to send her home. Think she was right? I don't know. She's been wrong before. And you know when you love someone and you really want to believe them but you're just having a hard time? Yep, I hear you. Yeah. So, what's got you slumped up against the wall? Oh, I just had to tell my patient that he has A.L.S. Oh. Yeah. I had to call his family in Chicago and tell them he was a ticking clock to a slow and terrible death. Yeah, that's a tough call to make. Yeah. And he was just getting it together, and then all of a sudden... You never know. So, he's talking to them now, and I wanted to give him some privacy. Yeah. Hey, Topher. What's up? Hey, guys. Hey. Hey. I was just looking for you. All right. No, I got to check on Ethan and calm the parents down, so I will see you at the end of the shift. Hey. Hey. What's going on? I just spoke with Joey. There's no Doctors Without Borders personnel anywhere near Ali. Okay, well, what about Smalls? What did... what did he find out? He figured out a way to get a doctor into Afghanistan. Okay, well, that's great. Who's the doctor? Me. I'm... I'm trying to understand. I know. I know. And thank you. Thank you for not pushing me. I told you last week I had some things to work through. This is one of them. Well... I'm the best nurse for the job. So whenever you're ready, I-I'll be there. I know. [Woman groaning] It feels like it's going to be twins. How badly you want to win? Aah! Oh, you know something, don't you? Mm-hmm. She's your ticket, but it's gonna cost you $50 cash. $40. $70. What?! Did you go to nursing school with Kenny? [Clicks tongue] Fine. $50. Come on. Ragosa : A chicken? She shoved a chicken in her... Yeah. She thought it would grow into a baby. Ugh. Ugh. I'm not gonna eat for a month. Yeah, I called the pet team in to see her. [Exhales heavily] Hey, Kenny. I think Drew is gonna end up winning this one. And I'm gonna be washing cars. Yeah, whatever, man. I'm not really thinking about that right now. ♪♪♪ So, it looks like he's responding to the meds, and the infection is getting under control. Oh! Thank God. And thank you. Jordan : Gwen. What the hell are you doing here? [Monitor beeping] I thought you went home. Gwen : I couldn't do that. You need to get out right now. Or what? What is he gonna do to you? Gwen. Ethan : Listen to her, mom. She's really smart. What did you say to him? He told me he's been holding his pee to protect you. He told me that when he wets the bed, your husband knocks the crap out of you? I'm sorry, mom. I had to tell somebody. So, the dental work that showed up on your scan, the vertigo... that isn't from a car accident, is it? You need to get out. I understand what you're going through. You don't. You can't. I do! My ex-husband used to beat me like a drum. Don't talk like that in front of my son. It's okay, mom. Show her your scar. [Sighs] That's just  one  of them. Lisa, you have to stop this. You have the power. I don't. I called the cops once, and they didn't even file a report. And then he hit me so hard that I have vertigo. But if he hits me, then he doesn't hit Ethan. And that is why you wanted us to cure him so fast... so he wouldn't take it out on you. 'Cause everything's my fault. [Scoffs, sniffles] Bed-wetting, grades, fevers. You can't help me... 'Cause I file a report and the only thing that's gonna happen is I'm gonna get the crap knocked out of me. I thought the same thing, and that's why I stayed so long, but I found a way out, and I guarantee you this is your way out. I promise you he will never touch you or Ethan ever again. Do it, mom. Please? But you got me in. A flight leaves this morning. If you miss it, there won't be another one. Is it true? Yeah. Are you insane? You can't go, Tophe, okay? I... no, listen to me. No offense. You are a doctor who was in the army. You were not a soldier in the army. Smalls, can you tell him what it's like over there now? I told him. Um, you're being dropped into a combat zone. There are no guarantees here. I understand. Do you hear that? Now, think about Janet and the kids. You... you think you think I haven't thought about my wife and my kids? I can go. No. No. No way. I-I can. No. There's no way. You... you just got back, so you're not going anywhere. Right, Smalls? There's there's no room. Yeah, he got the last seat on the flight. But listen. There's one thing I need you to do for me. Check your e-mail. I'm gonna send you my will and my life-insurance policy. Tophe... okay, just in case. Thank you all for your concern. I appreciate it. But I've made up my mind. I'm going. Thank you. [Sighs] We should be able to get the I.V. out of his arm soon. The meds have kicked in, and he'll be better than ever. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, David. What the hell is  she  doing here? My lawyers are gonna tear you apart. You're going to jail. What are you doing, baby? Don't make this mistake, okay? I... We should talk outside. Yes, we should. [Sighs] I don't know what you think you're pulling here, but you're not helping, okay? Lisa, do not listen to her. You don't want to do this. Or what? Yeah, or what? Who the hell are you? What is this? They help protect women and children who need to testify against a-holes like you. [Chuckles] I used the Baltimore chapter. I'm sure the San Antonio one is pretty good, too. Great. Okay, so, what are you gonna do? So, if anything happens to Lisa or Ethan, even if you're not at fault, even if he just falls off his bike, they're coming after you. I am... I am calling my lawyer. Yeah, you do that 'cause you're gonna need him. Officer, you have the complaint. Sir, if you would come with us. We need to ask you some questions. [Sighs, chuckles] This is  unbelievable  unbelievable. Hey, Ethan, I want you to meet the guys. Hey, buddy. You are so brave. Thank you so much. [Chuckles] Can I ask you... how long did it take before you weren't afraid anymore? I'm still working on it. Yeah. [Sniffles] [Voice breaking] I'm still working on it. Hey. I'm so proud of you. T.C. : How did the call go with your ex? It was great. Turns out that he was curious about seeing his pops, and my ex has all the forgiveness of a good Christian woman. They want me to come to his graduation. Seriously? Mm-hmm. That's great, Walt. You can get some closure. Yeah. I just wish I had a gift to give my son to tell him how much I love him. Well... Mollie?... Here's your gift. Got some crutches. Crutches? Yeah. It's for your dislocated ankle. That's your official diagnosis. I'm not following. Look, if I were you, I'd take the cash in this envelope. I'd buy a life-insurance policy with your son as the main beneficiary. Pay for the first two years up front. There's enough in that envelope to buy a policy that will help your son get through college. What about the A.L.S. records here? Hey, records get lost all the time. But I'd buy the policy as soon as possible. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you think it would be all right if I made Carlos' wife and their boy beneficiaries, too? Yeah, I think they'd appreciate that. Thanks again. But why are you doing this? [Sighs] Maybe someday somebody will do the same thing for my kid. Take care, Walt. Okay? ♪♪♪ [Elevator bell dings] Hey. Hey. [Sighs] I know you're going with Topher. And I know you've already made up your mind. [Sighs] I'm sorry. I... I just feel like I don't have a choice, okay? You... you have a choice, okay? We all have choices. [Sighs] And mine... Is to try and not stop you. You're letting me go? Honey, if something happened to Topher over there, you would blame me for stopping you, all right? You would think that you could have done something to save him, and I... No, no, no, no. I would never blame you. Yes, you would. No. Yes. You would. Okay? Maybe not consciously or you'd try to pretend that things were okay, but we would never survive that. No, Jordan... And we would  never  recover from that. [Sighs] [Chuckles] It's okay, you know? It's a security detail in Afghanistan. You're gonna go over there. You're gonna do an LVAD or... Yeah. Some procedure like that. Right. And then you are gonna come home... right?... to your woman... Yeah. And your baby. Yeah. Yes. Yes, okay? Just a couple of days. Simple. I love you. I love you, too. I love you, too. I'll be back before you know it. [Chuckles] Okay.
