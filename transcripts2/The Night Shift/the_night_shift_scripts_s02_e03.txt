 Woman : Come on! Come on! 
 [laughter] 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 [cheers and applause] 
 Team Heather by a hair! 
 [cheers and applause] 
 What? 
 No, we totally... we totally had that! 
 Hey, first rule of emergency medicine... don't piss off the nurses. 
 That breaks all ties. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I knew I should have been pushing. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Hey, come on. Let me... let me try that thing. 
 You know what I'm talking about? 
 Yeah. 
 Let me try. Let me try. 
 All right, try to get out of this choke hold. 
 Tell me when you think you got me. 
 Oh, uh, let me... oh, I got you. 
 [grunts] 
 Well, that was easy. 
 Yeah, I guess that's why you fight MMA and I don't. 
 [grunts] 
 I have to say, as an administrator, these shenanigans would have driven me nuts. 
 I am having such a great time. 
 Who knew this ER could have such a quiet night, huh? 
 [conversations stop] 
 Wh-What's wrong with you? 
 Don't... don't ever say the "Q" word. 
 What, I just...  
 [stammers] 
 You don't talk about fight club, you don't talk about a no-hitter, and you never, ever mention the "Q" word in an ER. 
 You will jinx it. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't know. 
 I didn't know! 
 Jordan : I haven't told my mom about us yet because she doesn't understand why I broke up with Scott and she knows how hard it was for us when you got back from the war. 
 She didn't like me before I went to war. 
 Hold on, did she really like Scott that much? 
 W-well... [sighs] What can I say? 
 You know, he called her on mother's day. 
 Look, all I'm saying is that... [sighs] 
 If I tell her now  before  she leaves, I'm not gonna get a moment's rest. 
 And to be honest with you, I don't feel like dealing with her nagging. 
 So I just figured that I would tell her after. 
 [pagers beeping] 
 Someone said the "Q" word. 
 [siren wails in distance] 
 Okay, team, so much for coasting through the morning. 
 We have a multi-victim traffic collision, stragglers filling the waiting room. 
 What do you got? 
 The first two were in a rollover MVA when it slammed into another vehicle in the rain. 
 That vic's still on the scene. 
 Okay, I got this. 
 First victim is 18 years old. 
 He has a deep gash to his left thigh from the broken glass. 
 Me and Jordan in Trauma Two. 
 Victim two was a front-seat passenger. 
 She's a minor with blunt-face and chest trauma. 
 [groans] 
 She has mild respiratory distress, but her sats are holding. 
 Take the girl into Trauma One. Krista, you're with me. 
 Paul and Drew, start working through the waiting-room patients... and, Drew, take Ragosa with you. 
 Show him the ropes. 
 Me? What? Why not Paul? 
 He's almost as green. You're not. 
 Put the girl right here. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 You know I can hear you, right? 
 Have fun with that. 
 [panting] 
 How's Taylor? Is she okay? 
 Ah, we're working on her in the other room. 
 But let's focus on you right now, okay? 
 I didn't even see the other car. 
 Is that driver okay? 
 Not here yet. 
 I'll get you an update when we have one. 
 Oh, okay, looks like he got the femoral. I need more gauze. 
 Jordan, the third MVA vic is two minutes out. 
 We got this. Go ahead. 
 All right, I'll send off a type and cross for six units. 
 Get me a large BP cuff to tourniquet the leg. 
 There's one in the next room. 
 [monitor beeping] 
 How's the boy? 
 Aah, femoral artery injury. But TC's on the case. 
 Here? 
 The jaw's dislocated. 
 It's obstructing her breathing. 
 Intubation tray is ready. 
 I don't think we'll need it. 
 [wheezing] 
 If we can reduce the jaw, breathing should be fine. 
 Just in the next room. 
 Call me if you need me. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Gwen : 1, 2, 3. 
 Thank you. I've got it from here. 
 Is this the woman the kid's car ran into? 
 Yep, approximately 30-year-old female. 
 Tachy, but otherwise stable. 
 Paramedic on the scene found her unconscious with bleeding scalp lacerations. 
 Doctor Chavez has been paged. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Okay, I need to tie this one off now. 
 4-0 Prolene. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, hey, Gwen. 
 Jordan. 
 Hey, Scott. 
 4-0 Prolene. 
 See you around, Jordan? 
 Joey's off on some family thing, and I'm on call, so what do we got here? 
 Hemodynamically stable, but came in with a scalp pumper. 
 I'm placing a purse-string suture, which should do the trick. 
 It says here abdominal trauma. 
 Could be internal bleeding. I'll check a fast scan. 
 Ultrasound, please. 
 Woman : Yes, Doctor. 
 Uh, Jordan? 
 She's pregnant? 
 Well, this just got a lot more complicated. 
 I'd say so. 
 Krista, let's go! 
 Done. 
 The tongue depressors will protect your thumbs from being bitten off, but be careful, okay? 
 Taylor, you're gonna feel some pressure, but it'll help you breathing, okay? 
 Just look at me, Taylor. Everything's gonna be okay. 
 All right? 
 Place your thumbs along her bottom teeth, then push inferior and posterior. 
 [groaning] 
 Slow and steady pressure. 
 [screams] 
 [rapid beeping] 
 Pulse ox is dropping. 
 Krista, you got to do this. 
 Don't make me step in. 
 Her jaw isn't moving. 
 Sats are down to 80. 
 You have to push harder. 
 Now's not now the time to be polite. 
 Okay. 
 [crack] 
 It moved! It moved! 
 [groans] 
 [rapid beeping stops] 
 Feels back in place. 
 Sats are up to 95. 
 Nice job, Krista. 
 Let's get her to X-ray. 
 How's my... don't talk, sweetie, okay? 
 Until we know your jaw's back in place. 
 How's my husband? 
 Your what? 
 My husband, Ryan. We just got married tonight. 
 What are you, like 14, 15? 
 I just turned 16. 
 Do me a favor. Please don't tell my dad about the marriage. 
 I don't think he's gonna be happy. 
 Yeah, that would be my guess. 
 Things are crazy in there. We got to keep things running out here. 
 We just had two new patients come in. 
 We have one lady complaining of a kidney stone and an elderly woman with an altered mental status. 
 Paul, you got the Queen Mother. We got the kidney stone. 
 Wait, hold on... uh, this isn't one of those "old people with STD" pranks, right? 
 I promise you she's not here for STDs. 
 In fact, if she has one, I'll pay you 500 bucks. 
 Paul, listen, I-I wouldn't go looking for STDs if I were you. 
 That's Marilyn Capshaw, the matriarch of this hospital's biggest donor family. 
 You mean... oh, crap...  the   Capshaws, like, the ones that fund the residency program. 
 Exactly. 
 The family's a total bunch of pain-in-the-ass hypochondriacs. 
 They have made my life a living hell. 
 You knew. 
 Of course. I had her sister my first year. 
 She came in at 3:00 a.m. nothing wrong with her. 
 She had me written up as incompetent. 
 Enjoy. 
 Nice move. I did not want...  
 Okay, just take this lady's chart and come get me when you have a differential diagnosis. 
 Taylor : I knew we should have stopped to rest, but we wanted to get back before our parents knew we were gone. 
 And you really got married? 
 We had to. 
 Our parents wouldn't let us see each other. 
 We thought, if we got married, they couldn't keep us apart. 
 Uh, I don't think that's how it works. 
 I mean, don't you need their permission? 
 No. 
 We found a 24-hour wedding chapel in Arkansas online, and you only have to be 16, which I turned tonight. 
 [sighs] Note to self. 
 Don't let daughter anywhere near Arkansas. 
 Taylor, is that you?! 
 Oh. Remember, don't tell him I'm married. 
 I don't want to get in trouble. 
 I'm her father, Denny Sawyer. 
 Taylor, are you okay? I'm fine, daddy, I think. 
 She's been in an accident. 
 I'm Doctor Zia. This is Doctor Bell-Hart. 
 Hey. 
 Your daughter took a pretty good shot to the head so, we're gonna get it scanned, and then we'll know more. 
 Okay, good. I was scared to death when I got the phone call. 
 Well, I'm sorry I scared you, but it's all okay now. 
 Well, not everything. 
 I mean, you're gonna be grounded for being out at 3:00 a.m. 
 Dad, I... and that's the last time you stay at Candace's house. I'm gonna have a word with her parents Excuse me. and make sure they understand... 
 Taylor's friend Ryan keeps asking to see her. 
 Can I get...  
 M-Mollie. 
 Ryan? Ryan's here? 
 Okay, sir, l-let's just... 
 I told you I didn't want you seeing that punk Ryan. 
 And now you're out in the middle of the night with him, in a car no less? 
 Let's settle this after the CAT scan. 
 I'm sorry Daddy! 
 We got married! We had to! 
 You gave us no choice. 
 Married?! 
 How... how do you...  
 Okay, Krista, get her in the scanner. 
 How could you be married?! You're only 16 years old! 
 Sir, please, please calm down. 
 There's plenty of time to be angry. 
 Let's just make sure she's okay for now, okay? 
 Kenny : All right, first unit is in. 
 Pressure's up to 84. 
 Run two more units on the rapid infuser. 
 I need another 6-0 of silk. 
 Ryan's parents are here. They want to see him. 
 Just for a minute. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my God, Ryan. 
 Is he gonna be okay? 
 Yeah, he's injured his femoral artery, but I got the bleeding under control. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 We got the call, and I almost had a heart attack on the way over here. 
 Yeah, I understand. 
 Those late-night calls must scare the crap out of you. 
 Listen, he's gonna be okay, so if you just let me finish... 
 Harrison, I told you to keep your son away from my daughter. 
 What are you doing here? 
 They went off and got married. 
 What do you mean, "married"? Did she get pregnant? 
 I'm not talking to you. 
 Hey, I'm trying to work here. 
 Take it outside. 
 I'm talking to him. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's my wife. 
 Kenny, take it outside. 
 I'll talk to her anyway I want to talk to her. 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 ♪♪♪ 
 I'll talk to her any way I want. 
 I think that's part of the problem. 
 This is what your daughter learned from! 
 This is why she cats around Ryan! 
 No wonder she dresses like a slut! 
 You son of a bitch! 
 Everybody... 
 Hey, hey, hey, no! No! 
 Hey! 
 What are you gonna do about it, Huh? Huh? 
 Stop! Look, this is a hospital! 
 People are working! 
 Okay? Show some respect! 
 Now, Ryan's mom and dad, you can go to the waiting room. 
 Go on. 
 Now you go to the cafeteria. 
 Well done, Kenny. 
 Didn't have to call security or anything. 
 These are the only guns I need. [Grunts] 
 E-even I would look ripped in your scrub top. 
 I mean, w-what is this, like, a boy's small? 
 Anyway, let me know when Krista brings Taylor back from CT. 
 Nobody makes fun of Superman. He got a tight shirt. 
 Woman : She's waking up. 
 Okay. Mm-hmm. 
 All set? 
 [pulsing] 
 My... my baby! How's my baby?! 
 Your baby's doing great, okay? 
 Look, see? 
 I'm Doctor Alexander, and this is Doctor Clemens. 
 And we'd like to do a scan of your brain. 
 No. My brain is fine, okay? I don't want to expose my baby to any radiation. 
 I agree. 
 And that's why I'm going to use the ultrasound machine to check the pressure in your brain... make sure it's okay, there's no bleeding. 
 And it is 100% safe for your baby. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 That's fine. 
 I'm sorry to be such a pain. 
 I just want to protect my baby. 
 Okay, go ahead and close your eyes for me. 
 This might feel a little funny. 
 [warbling] 
 Hmm. This is a great idea, Scott. 
 Yeah, I've been known to have a few. 
 [monitor beeps] 
 So, your fiancé's in the army? 
 Yeah, yeah, he's a corporal stationed at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany. 
 We're getting married once he gets back, you know, before she's born. 
 That's great. 
 Okay, it looks like the diameter of your optic nerve is well within normal limits, so I would say you are good to go. 
 Okay. Thanks for understanding. 
 Well, what can I say? 
 I'm an understanding kind of guy. 
 Ow! Ow, ow! 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. She's just kicking, you know... 
 [laughs] Do you mind calling my fiancé and just explaining to him what's going on? 
 I'd be glad to. 
 Next time, don't make us wait as long. 
 I need you to do every test here immediately, and I do not want to have to wait for the results. 
 You understand? 
 Uh, yes, s-sir. 
 She's been off lately, but it got so bad tonight I couldn't deal with it anymore. 
 I'm expecting a precise diagnosis by morning. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 You're a beautiful dancer. 
 Do you know how to rumba? 
 See what I mean? Here are her things. 
 I'll be checking in. 
 Mother, I'll be back in a few hours. 
 Uh, this way, please. After you. 
 Mm, soft as a baby. 
 Gwen : What are you doing, cruising Tinder? 
 Yeah, I'm trying to get in touch with Chloe's fiancé, but I keep getting his voicemail. 
 I'm gonna have to get one of the nurses to track him down for her. 
 Hey, let me do it. 
 They're still working. I just got off my shift. 
 You don't want to go home? 
 To an empty apartment? 
 I'd rather stay and help the pregnant girl. 
 Nice to know someone who's getting laid, huh? 
 All right, thank you. - Mm-hmm. 
 All right, now I would like you to follow my finger, okay? 
 All right, and now... a-and repeat after me. 
 "No ifs, ands, or buts." 
 No ifs, and you have a nice butt. 
 [both laugh] Okay, all right. 
 Let's, uh... let's try and focus, all right? Okay. 
 Um, name as many animals as you can in 30 seconds, all right? 
 And... Go. 
 Zebra. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Coyote. Coyote. 
 I suppose you're too young to remember Wile E. Coyote. 
 No, I'm actually... I-I... always trying to catch that damn roadrunner, but he never could. 
 Beep, beep! That's the sound road runner made. 
 Beep, beep! 
 [laughs] 
 Beep, beep! 
 All right. No, I... no, I get it. 
 I... that's sweet. Yeah. 
 Oh, but I like it. 
 How's it going teaching Ragosa? 
 Ohh, if it was any other physician's assistant, I wouldn't mind babysitting. 
 But that guy, he's always been such a pain in our asses. 
 Oh, come on. He's not that bad. 
 You just have to get to know him. 
 Yeah, that's right on the top of my to-do list. 
 Hey, Jordan? 
 So, that cell number that Chloe gave us is still going to voicemail. 
 I left a message to call, but there's also no record of Chloe's fiancé ever being at Ramstein. 
 Never heard of him. 
 Well, maybe the guy wanted out, so he just lied. 
 Wouldn't be the first time someone got scared off by a baby or lied about ending a relationship. 
 My gut tells me that's not the case. 
 Uh, why don't you try calling Fort Hood and see if... if he was deployed in the Middle East. 
 I know right where you're headed. 
 Thank you. 
 [clicks tongue] 
 Hey, Scott. 
 Hmm? 
 Uh, do we need to talk? 
 'Cause I feel like you're taking these not-so-subtle jabs at me. 
 No. No, no, no. Not at all. 
 No, no, I was... 
 I was talking about Chloe and her situation, not ours. 
 Look, was I pissed at first? Yes, I was. 
 Was I hurt? Yeah. 
 But trust me, I am more than fine with how everything's worked out, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I'll go page OB for you. 
 Thank you. 
 [monitor beeping] 
 [sighing] 
 Hey. Look who's awake. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Terrible. How's my wife, Taylor? 
 You wife is getting some tests. 
 And just so you know, your parents are here. 
 And her dad. 
 Nobody seemed particularly happy. 
 Her dad? 
 Yeah. 
 He just hates me because we're rich. 
 Well, I don't think your marriage is gonna do your case any favors. 
 [door opens] 
 Is this Ryan Harrison? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, he's stable. You can talk to him. 
 [police radio chatter] Just for a few minutes, though. 
 Uh, officer, this is my son. 
 It was my car that he wrecked in the crash. 
 Uh, here's our insurance card. Anything else you need? 
 I'm not here about the car. 
 Ryan Harrison, you are under arrest for the sexual assault of a minor. 
 Get those off my boy. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Get those off me. You can't arrest me. 
 We're married. It's not illegal. 
 Anything you do say can and will be used Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hang on. against you in the court of law. 
 What's going on? 
 Dad, help me! Get these off me! 
 You have a right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you. Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you? 
 Please! Dad, she's my wife! Help me. 
 Ow! Ow! My baby! 
 What happened? 
 I'm not sure. I found her like this. 
 It's my stomach! [Crying] 
 Hey, Kenny, start her on morphine. 
 Chloe? Chloe, these are contractions. 
 You're in labor. 
 No, no, no! 
 It's not... it's not time. It's too early for the baby. 
 We can try to slow the contractions down. 
 But, honey, worst case, your baby's far enough along to be viable. 
 No. 
 All right, morphine's in. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. 
 Why is this happening? 
 Okay. 
 Look, I promised my dad I'd be married before I had the baby. 
 I'm sure he'll understand. 
 No! He died last month! 
 Look, I can't break my promise to him! 
 Please, it would crush my mom! 
 Chloe, I am so sorry. 
 Honey, the best thing you can do right now is try to focus on staying calm, 
 'cause that's what's best for you and your baby. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Okay? 
 Kenny, start a mag sulfate infusion. 
 On it. 
 [crying] I don't want to do this alone. 
 You're gonna be great. It's okay. 
 Now, deputy, you don't need to escalate this, all right? 
 He just wants to know what's happening with his son. 
 He's an 18-year-old having s*x with a 15-year-old. 
 She's 16. 
 Oh, and that makes it okay for you? 
 You son of a bitch. You did this, didn't you? 
 You're damn right I did. 
 I told you to keep your son away from my daughter. 
 And you wouldn't, so I will. 
 This will ruin Ryan's life. 
 His life? 
 His life is set! He's got a BMW and a trust fund. 
 My Taylor was at the top of her class until she started running around with your son. 
 Whoa, whoa,  she's  chasing  him! 
 And he quit the baseball team 'cause of your little gold digger. 
 Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 Hey, hey! 
 Hey, hey! 
 Cool it. 
 Okay, okay, fighting is not gonna make your kids any better. 
 Topher : This is the second ruckus you guys have started. 
 If it happens again, I'm booting you both. You understand? 
 I'm gonna call my lawyer, and this is gonna end. 
 You've gone too far, Sawyer. You're done! 
 Your money's not gonna help you this time, dick. 
 Okay, Mr Sawyer, I understand why you're upset. 
 Do you have a daughter? 
 No. 
 But... then you have no idea. 
 She's all I have left. 
 Mr Sawyer. 
 Why don't you wait in the waiting room? 
 That sounded intense. 
 Yeah. 
 Young love, Texas style. 
 All right. 
 Hey, do you have a minute to do me a favor? 
 Yeah, sure. What's up? 
 Well, my pregnant patient is so stressed-out about having her baby before she's married that her BP Is off the charts, which just complicated premature labor. 
 Yeah, that's not good. 
 No. 
 And Gwen found out that her fiancé lied about being stationed in Germany and he's really in Afghanistan. 
 He told her that so she wouldn't worry. 
 Sound familiar? 
 No. 
 I mean, I was gonna tell you eventually... 
 When I got back. 
 And I figured out where you were in less than a week. 
 Anyway... oh, thank you. 
 Here's the list. 
 Uh, we've managed to track down his unit, but we've been unable to reach him. 
 So I was wondering if maybe you could ask one of your army buddies to help out. 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Tee? 
 Can I have a word? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah. Coming. Uh, yeah, I can do that. 
 Thank you. I owe you one. 
 Yeah. What you got, Toph? 
 Oh, having seconds thoughts? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 No. 
 I just didn't know that he was seeing someone so soon. 
 Really? Oh, by the way, your mom called me. 
 She wanted to know the real reason why you guys broke up. 
 Well, what did you tell her? 
 The truth. 
 Herpes. 
 I didn't say who had it. 
 [chuckles] 
 You're a horrible friend. 
 You know that, right? 
 Topher : Mr Sawyer, the sheriff called me himself, telling me to remove the cuffs immediately and... and to apologize. 
 That deputy who did this is being reprimanded. 
 He was enforcing the law. 
 He was enforcing your revenge. 
 Apparently, in Texas, there's something called The Romeo and Juliet Law, which allows for consensual intercourse with a minor within three years of age. 
 It's... it's not illegal. 
 TC : We heard the deputy was your buddy, and that's why you did it. 
 He did it because we served together. 
 We'd do anything for each other. 
 Look, I get that. 
 With all due respect, boys... hey, I did three tours in the sandbox. 
 Rangers. Doctor Zia here did two. 
 I thought you were just doctors. 
 You sound like my mother-in-law. 
 Where were you? 
 [sighs] Paktika, Helmand, Gawardesh. 
 [scoffs] 
 I spent some time in Helmand I'd like to forget. 
 Two... two long deployments, you know. 
 I come back the second time... my daughter is living with friends. 
 My wife, gone. 
 Didn't want to be a wife anymore, or a mom, or... just gone. 
 I'm sorry. That's... that's rough. 
 You know, sometimes, it's, uh... it's harder coming back than it is being there. 
 Yeah, yeah. [Sniffles] 
 That's true. Yeah. 
 And... and now I work these two crap jobs to... just to keep her in that school so she's got a future. 
 I'm not gonna let that punk ruin it. 
 Why don't we get some coffee? 
 And I'll... I'll get an update on your daughter's scans. 
 We can talk it out. 
 Great, right. Thanks, doc. 
 Right. 
 Drew : So, what's your assessment? 
 32-year-old female with colicky flank pain and large blood in her urinalysis, which indeed points to a kidney stone. 
 I ordered her a CT, some IV fluids, and I was gonna give her pain meds for the discomfort. 
 How about a band-aid? 
 Band-aid? - Your finger, please. 
 The other finger. 
 She pricks her finger, puts a few drops of blood in the urine sample to make it look like a kidney stone so she can get narcotics. 
 I cut this on a magazine. I saw you in here last month trying to same gag, and I remember you 'cause you were wearing a Lakers T-shirt and I hate the Lakers. 
 Stop wasting our time. You understand me? 
 We got real patients. Get some help. 
 If you had checked the chart, you would have found she's been in here a ton of times trying to get narcotics. 
 Things often aren't what they seem. 
 So, my brother... and he's a platoon leader. 
 So he... he yells up, "hey, hey, I got him! 
 I smoked... I smoked his ass!" 
 So we run down there, right, just making sure it's all clear. 
 And he smoked him, all right, except it wasn't Taliban. 
 No? It was a cow. 
 A cow? Yeah. 
 It was the first steak we had in about six months. 
 And after that, Thad was forever known as "Smoke." 
 "Lord Smoke." 
 [both laugh] 
 Yeah. 
 How's your brother doing? 
 Is he... is he still in? 
 No, no. 
 No. No, no. No, no. H-he was KIA. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Nah. [Scoffs] It's cool. 
 Were you over there when that happened? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I... I was about 15 feet from him when it happened. 
 [chuckles] 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Oh, my God. 
 [sighs] 
 Let me ask you something. 
 How are you so together? 
 Nah, I'm not together, man. It's still a struggle. 
 [chuckles] 
 Ah. You got a good job, right? 
 You got a good woman? 
 Yeah, the best. 
 You marry her? 
 Almost. Almost. 
 I-I planned on asking her when I got back from the war, and then everything went to hell. 
 I'd say you got it pretty well together. 
 Me? I-I'm back two years. 
 I... I can't seem to get ahead. 
 Like quicksand, you know. 
 I get myself out and, uh, you know, I'm right back in it. 
 Over there, I was a leader of men. 
 Yeah. 
 I was kicking down doors, taking names. 
 I wore the uniform proud, you know? 
 I mean, look at the uniform I wear now. 
 I'm a joke. 
 No. 
 It took me a few years to get where I'm at. 
 I was a mess. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 And the only thing that turned it around was... was me asking for help. 
 Well... Who am I gonna ask, you know? 
 I mean, Taylor, I can't talk to her. She's just a kid. 
 There's a lot of programs that can help. 
 You got to turn it around, man. 
 Otherwise, you're gonna drown in anger and self-pity. 
 I've been there. 
 You got to drop the pride BS. 
 There's a lot of people who are willing to help you. 
 But   you   got to ask for it. 
 And then, I-if they offer it, you got to take it. 
 I'm offering. 
 So just... just take it. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Do it for the cow. 
 [laughs] 
 [monitor beeping] 
 [whimpering] 
 This is not gonna hurt. 
 We're just checking your heart, okay? 
 Okay. Have you heard anything? 
 About Ryan? 
 Yeah, he's resting comfortably. He's no longer under arrest. 
 And, yes, he's been asking about you. 
 How is she? 
 Head CT looked good. 
 Her others scans are coming up shortly. 
 Oh, that's great. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't want to talk to you. 
 Taylor, I love you. I'm trying to protect you. 
 So you got Ryan arrested? 
 We're nothing to them, sweetie. 
 [rapid beeping] 
 You never even tried to get to know him, or how he makes me feel. 
 I'm just doing what's best for you. 
 I... you know, I hate you. 
 I hate you. 
 Don't say that. 
 I hate you! 
 Don't say that! 
 Heart rate's going up. 
 [groans] 
 She needs to rest. 
 My chest! 
 Taylor, what's wrong? 
 [gasping] 
 What's going on? I heard an alarm. 
 It looks like a heart attack. 
 Heart attack?! She's 16 years old! Do...  
 All right, all right. 
 Okay, it's not an infarction. It's a dissection. 
 Her aorta's tearing in half. 
 Call Scott. Tell him to meet us in the OR now. 
 What's happening? Where are you taking her? 
 Sir, we're going to the OR I need you to stay here. 
 Taylor! Taylor! 
 I will check back in with you! 
 Woman over PA :  Doctor Clegg to Trauma One. 
 Doctor Clegg to Trauma One. 16-year-old with aortic dissection from an MVA. 16? Her parent's here? Her father and husband. Long story. All right, tell the OR we're going on bypass immediately. ♪   Come on and make a move   ♪ 
♪   there's another world outside your door   ♪ You got stuck with Marilyn Capshaw, huh? Yeah, yeah. [chuckles] Here with altered mental status, disorganized thinking and attention. I'm thinking acute delirium, maybe encephalopathy. CT? Normal, as was her EEG, CMP, CBC, and all her other labs. Her, uh... her son has called over five times and left messages about her diagnosis. I just... I wanted to run the case by you first. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mrs Capshaw? Hello. I'm Doctor Zia. We've met a couple of times before. Do you have change for a $20? I need more chips. I-I don't have any cash on me. Do you mind if I take a look at your pretty eyes? Well, sure, you sweet thing. All right. [chuckles] Yes. Uh-huh. Pretty as ever. Thank you, love. Did you do a tox screen? [scoffs] Um, no. She's, uh... she's 82. She's 82 and high as a kite. Wait, what? Baked, blazed, stoned out of her gourd, whatever euphemism you want. Trust me. Send the test. ♪   So, you can fall down or you can bounce up   ♪ Want some chips? Mm. So, how's checking vitals going? Uh, it was going fine, but I can't feel this guy's pulse. What do you mean? You're checking for it in the wrong spot. No, I-I-I know how to check a radial pulse, okay. Th-there isn't one. I can't feel a femoral. Son of a bitch. What did you do? What did you do?! I stepped out for one minute! Not... n-nothing! I-I-I was practicing vitals like you said. Get the crash cart. Yes, Doctor. Wait, wait wait! Wait, wait! You're gonna shock him?! Yes. Damn it, he's got dogjaw. What? Dogjaw! Check his carotid and see Oh, my God. if you can find a pulse. [barks] [clatter] [laughter] Mr Howard has a ventricular assist device. Comes in a couple times a year to get it checked. His blood flows continuously rather than by pump, so no pulse. Freaky, huh? [laughter] Ah, pranking that someone's in cardiac arrest. Yeah, that's... that's hilarious. Welcome to the night shift. And what did I tell you last time? Check the chart. It's all right there. You're a great teacher, Drew. Thanks for all your help. [laughter] [barks] The good news is we stopped your contractions. But you have an early placental abruption. So when the OB is done with his other Oh, God. delivery, you're going to need a c-section. Can... I need to call my fiancé. Have you found him? I need to talk to him. Yes... technically, yes. [groans] We just need to get our hands on him physically. Look, stress is not good for the baby or the abruption. Okay? Remember, deep breathes. Just please find him. How's Ragosa doing? Pouting. Still thinks he's a VP and not the PA. Well, Rome wasn't built in a day. I still don't understand how you can give him this job. He was such a dick to you and the rest of us. Yeah, he was. You remember when you first came out? Wait, I'm gay? Doctor Alister. One of the board members wanted to fire you, which, as you know, they can in Texas. Guess who called him a bigot and said he'd fight him tooth and nail on that? Ragosa? Mm. "Check out the big brain on Brad." Hey. Hey. How's the girl? Scott's got his hands full. I-I came out to talk to her dad, but I couldn't find him. Hmm. I wanted to tell you my buddy tracked down the fiancé. He's in Afghanistan in Bagram. Oh, good. And he's still...  Totally into her. Just freaked out about her and the baby. Yeah, well, it doesn't look like this baby's gonna wait for a wedding. What are you... what are you doing in here? Getting some privacy. Well, your lab results came back. They show very high levels of marijuana. Could have told you that. S-so why didn't you? You made me look like an idiot in front of my boss. You did that to yourself. You saw an old lady and never thought of the possibility, though I was exhibiting all of the behavior. Look, I-I-I need to tell your son. He's been all over me about what's wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with me. A little advice, Paul. Don't try to so hard to please everybody. You know, you'll only end up with regrets. W... hey, hey, you... you can't do that. Not here. Why do you think I wanted privacy? Besides, you gonna stop me? You want a hit? N-no, thank you. Go ahead. Your father would be very disappointed. Wait, what? How do... how do you...  Know your father? What do you think? Called me last year about your internship. He... he got me in here? Actually, he wanted us to keep you out. You know, h-he still calls me once a month, trying to get me to quit ER. He says one day I can join him and my brother's practice in Chicago. And why don't you? 'Cause I don't want to follow anybody. The real reason. [sniffs] Uh, what if... what if I'm... I'm not good enough? Maybe... maybe I'm Peyton Manning, right? But maybe I'm Jeffrey Jordan. Th-those are the sons of... I know who they are. Okay. Now, look, I know I'm buzzed, but I'm gonna give you one last piece of advice. Now, even though I was the black sheep of the family, I still never followed my heart. I did what they wanted me to. So you figure out what you want to do. Not from fear, but for the right reasons. And they can go to hell if they get in your way. [chuckles] [inhales deeply] Thank you. I will. Now... Here's what we're gonna tell my son. [flatline] Ragosa: Hey, you paged me? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not falling for this crap again, okay, Drew? This is real. You want to learn something? Grab that crash cart. This is Mr Simpson. He came in with a heart attack, went into v-fib arrest. Now, hit "power." Set the voltage to 360. [beep] Press "charge." Okay. [paddles whine] This is all you. B-but I've never done this before. Then it's gonna be a hell of a good time to learn, isn't it? Set the paddles at 10:00 and 5:00. Okay. Okay, like this? Yeah, everybody clear. Go. [thump] Still v-fib. [flatline] What are you gonna do? Okay, uh, charging again. [paddles whine] [beeping] Clear. [thump] [monitor beeping] Oh, man, that's sinus. I can feel a pulse. Yes, it is. Hang an amiodarone drip. Get him to the cath lab. Woman : Okay, right away. Oh, holy cow. That man was...  ... dead. And now he isn't. Congratulations. You just saved his life. Thanks. It turns out she just had low blood sugar. I-I gave her IV dextrose. And here's a list of dietary adjustments. That's all? I mean, she was... get the car. Doctor Zia? Topher : Yes, Ma'am? Are you aware of what a remarkable young doctor you have here? I expect him to be made an attending physician at this institution one day very soon in whatever specialty he pursues. How did you pull that off? Uh, it must be my wonderful bedside manner, I-I guess. [monitor beeping] I love you, baby. [Chuckles] You look so beautiful. Hey. You paged me? Uh, yeah. We're all set here. We just need an in-person proxy groom to read the vows. [chuckles] You game? Sure. Why not? I got a few minutes. Good man. Thank you. Of course. Tom, I'm Doctor Callahan. It is an honor to stand in for you, Sergeant. The honor's mine. I can't thank you enough for making this wedding happen, Doctors. Can't get married without a bouquet. [laughing] Why, thank you. Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God to join together in holy matrimony...  [gasping] ... Chloe and Tom. [rapid beeping] Jordan : Baby's having accelerations. I'm feeling short of breath. All right, that's it. We're getting her to the OR. What's happening? Chloe? Sorry, Daddy. Baby, I'm sorry. This ain't over yet, sweetie. Okay, somebody tell the OB we're on our way. Okay, what is...  w-where are you taking her? Reverend, skip to the good stuff and try to keep up. Somebody talk to me. I've never done anything like this. Move it along, Padre. You got about 15 seconds. Chloe, are you okay? Do you take this woman to be your wedded wife? I do. Do you take this man to be your wedded husband? I do. Chloe? She does. Then I pronounce you man and wife. BP's down to 40 systolic. Chloe, I love you. Gwen : Jordan! She's hemorrhaging! We can't get her to the OR we got to do it down here. Trauma One. Let's go. The baby's heart rate is still down. Opening the peritoneum. Two units of blood are in. Well, this is a hell of a honeymoon. Any word from OB? Scalpel. She has her hands full with a uterine rupture upstairs. Glad we got started. Incising the uterus. Hey, setting up the Skype with the father in 15 minutes. Anything I can tell him? Yeah, I'll have the story for him in about five seconds. You want to watch? Yeah. There we go. Here she comes. [baby crying] All right. You tell them, sweetie. Topher : Cutting the cord. My... my... how's my baby girl? She's beautiful, just like her mother and her doctor. I think he was talking about himself. Yeah, I'm sure he was. [laughter] [voice breaking] Sorry, I just love babies. And weddings. [chuckles] Chloe : Thank you for everything. You have no idea what this means to me. Who's my baby girl?
