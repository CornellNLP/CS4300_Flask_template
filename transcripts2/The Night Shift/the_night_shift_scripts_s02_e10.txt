 Oh no! 
 [Laughing] 
 You didn't. 
 Oh yes, I did. 
 Told you I'd buy a bike. 
 Jordan is not gonna be happy. 
 Jordan knows. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 So, she's cool with her baby daddy riding a donor cycle? 
 Oh, no, I didn't say that. No. 
 I said I told her I was gonna do it. 
 Mm. 
 Speaking of, does Janet know that you're going to Dubai next month? 
 Not exactly. Hasn't come up. 
 Oh, hasn't come up 'cause you haven't told her. 
 [Laughs] Okay. 
 Janet is gonna roast your nuts. 
 I'm just waiting for the right time. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Who am I kidding? I'm delaying because I know she's gonna be pissed, and I don't blame her, but I have to go. 
 Oh, you have to. Ali saved your life. 
 You owe him. 
 And so does Janet. 
 I'm just waiting for the right time to tell her. 
 I don't know that there is a right time, buddy. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 The assailant opened fire on military personnel and their families at an army promotion ceremony. Eyewitnesses report a local hero and active serviceman sprang into action and tackled the gunman to the floor. Dr. Drew Alister then courageously wrestled the weapon out of the gunman's hand. 
 Yo, San Antonio, superman. 
 Get over here, man! 
 You're on TV! There he is! 
 Yeah! 
 Not interested. 
 Toph, what do you got? 
 Hey, it's your call, Dr. Badass. 
 "Dr. Badass." [Chuckles] 
 Um, abdominal rupture, Trauma One, hemorrhoids, curtain three. 
 [Sputters] 
 Easy choice. 
 Oh, so I get the hemorrhoids? 
 Not if you're careful. 
 See what I did? 
 No, it's terrible. 
 Hey, Paul. 
 Uh, knee pain in the waiting room. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, Tee? 
 Yeah. 
 Do me a favor. Uh, with Jordan out at the conference, can you keep an eye on Paul tonight? 
 Yes, of course, baby. 
 [Phone ringing, siren wailing in distance] 
 Hello. 
 [Cellphone buzzing] 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Simone. 
 Oh, what? Why? 
 Topher?! 32-year-old male with a deep laceration to his left arm! 
 Okay, Trauma Two! 
 Got it. 
 Okay, Brent just came in the door. See you soon. 
 Michael, you're with me. 
 Brent, how are you feeling, brother? 
 [Sighs] Stupid, mostly. 
 You two know each other? 
 We lived down the street from each other. 
 What happened? 
 Build a new dining table. Next thing I knew... 
 Pissed off a power saw from the looks of it. 
 Yeah. 
 His pulse is 115. 
 B.P. 80 over 42. 
 I started a saline bolus in the field. 
 Simone's on her way. I guess you left her quite a message. 
 Only that I was headed to the E.R. 
 That's always soothing. 
 Heather, grab some O-Neg from the blood bank. 
 You got it. 
 And 1, 2, 3. 
 [Moans] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Gonna fix you right up, brother. 
 [Breathing heavily] Okay. 
 Hey, uh, just checked with X-Ray. 
 Uh, Kaylee's up next. Where... where is she? 
 She stepped out for a sec. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, guys, I'm right here. 
 I thought you went to the bathroom. 
 I did, but the vending machine was on the way. 
 Kaylee [Sighs] 
 I swear, I don't allow her to eat processed sugar. 
 Sorry, I'm nervous. 
 You know what getting into this play means for me. 
 Don't be so hard on yourself. 
 Well, how about we make sure you don't have to hobble onto the stage, okay? 
 I believe your Tendinitis is flaring up. 
 I'll give her some prescription-strength Ibuprofen, and we'll do the X-Ray just to be safe, okay? 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Callahan. 
 Everything good here? 
 Uh, yeah, I was just letting Kaylee know that I think her Tendinitis is coming back. 
 The excess weight is putting pressure on her joints. 
 We're working on her diet and trying to work out. 
 Heather : Excuse me. 
 Ready for the X-Rays. 
 Okay, thank you. Uh, after you. 
 That is a cute dress. 
 Thank you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hold all my calls. 
 [Laughs] 
 Paul : Will do. 
 I found this on him, and I left it 'cause it was spot-on. 
 This is an army tactical tourniquet. 
 Chuck Norris here travels to bases around the country, training our troops. 
 Kidding. 
 Oh, combatives... hand-to-hand combat. 
 But it looks like I'm gonna be out of commission for a while. 
 Topher will fix you right up. 
 All right, I'm out on another call, okay? 
 Thanks, Gwen. 
 Felt like an idiot for calling 911. 
 [Sighs] 
 I tried to drive myself, but the arm wouldn't cooperate. 
 You did the right thing. Treatment plan, Michael? 
 Irrigate the wound, assess for nerve, tendon, and vessel damage, suture on multiple layers, Tetanus, prophylaxis, and antibiotics. 
 Yes, after Morphine. 
 We want to make sure he's comfortable first. 
 [Moans] 
 Simone is gonna kill me. 
 Oh, man, that's right. Your wedding's in a few weeks. 
 And I look like I just walked out of one of those "saw" movies. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, when I started my residency, any given night, you would have, you know, like a half a dozen shootings, a few stabbings, a steady flow of crack addicts. 
 I mean, it was great. 
 For learning. It... 
 Of course. 
 It was great for learning. 
 For learning. 
 Yeah. 
 No wonder you're so calm under pressure. 
 To be honest with you, if you want to know what makes me not so calm, it's this speech that I have to deliver in front of, what, half my mentors. 
 It's freaking me out. 
 You'll do great, really. 
 And thank you so much for inviting me to this conference. 
 Yeah. 
 Because, outside of you, I-it's just really hard to find good female role models when you're working the night shift. 
 Tell me about it. It's a bit of a sausage fest. 
 You gonna meet some really great people, and there are some really strong... 
 [Tires screech] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Call 911. 
 Yeah. 
 Damn it! There's still no reception. 
 Just keep trying. [Sighing] 
 I see him! 
 Yeah? 
 Sir? 
 All right, his pulse is weak. 
 I need to roll him over and check his airway and examine his c-spine. 
 Okay, I'll get the head. You get the side. 
 Okay, on three. 
 Both : 1, 2, 3. 
 Okay, easy, easy. 
 C-spine intact on palpation. 
 Damn, this is bad. 
 We need to stop the bleeding now. 
 Oh, man. [Sniffs] 
 We need to get him out of here. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 So, I, uh, I see you got your Harley back. 
 Yeah. Jordan will never allow that. 
 Oh, Kenny, I'm not sure how you handle your relationships, but Jordan and I... Help! 
 Help, doctor! We need help! 
 Doctor! 
 Oh! 
 What happened?! 
 I don't know. She just started seizing. 
 Can we get a gurney? 
 Yeah, on it. 
 Marla : Oh, my gosh, Kaylee! Doctors, help her. 
 Make it stop.

 The Night Shift 2x10 Aftermath 
 [Coughing] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Temp is 103 now, persistent cough. 
 Been fighting the Flu for a couple weeks. 
 That's probably why I got lightheaded with the saw in my hand. 
 Is the light bothering your eyes? 
 I wouldn't say "bothering." I just... 
 I notice it. 
 Do you have a headache? 
 Nothing I can't handle. 
 Brent, it's me here, okay? 
 No time to be a tough guy. 
 I need to know if you have a headache or not. 
 Yeah. 
 For a few weeks now. 
 Okay, I'd like to do a spinal tap. 
 A what? Why? 
 Because fever, headache, and light sensitivity may indicate something much more serious than the Flu. 
 Temp is spiking. 104 and climbing. 
 Okay, we need to do this now. 
 [Sighs] 
 Uh, we're headed to Trauma One! 
 Okay, I'm gonna move you onto your side. 
 Keep your airway unobstructed. 
 Paul, I'm gonna need a 10 of Diazepam. Right. 
 Did I miss something? 
 Well, leg pain doesn't usually cause a seizure, but... 
 Seizure?! I don't know what happened! 
 She was just fine! 
 She's gonna be okay. 
 Okay, hold still, brother. 
 I know it's gonna be uncomfortable, but you're doing great. 
 Almost there. 
 Oh, I can take it. 
 I came as soon as I could! 
 Hey, Simone. 
 What the hell? 
 My God, Brent, you said you just cut yourself. 
 I did, but they stitched me up good. I'm fine. 
 Okay, guys, if you can just hold the discussion for a few more moments while I finish. 
 I'm sorry, Topher. 
 There's a gigantic needle in his spine. 
 What's going on? 
 Babe, let him do his job. 
 Okay, take that to the lab, please, Heather. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 Lie back down. 
 Here. 
 [Sighs] 
 Topher : All right. 
 Hey. Here's where we're at. 
 We expect the arm to heal nicely. 
 There wasn't any nerve damage from the saw. 
 But... 
 Here comes the "but." 
 Y-you have symptoms of Meningitis. 
 We'll know for sure as soon as we get the spinal-tap results. 
 Oh, my God, that's... That's serious, right? 
 It can be. 
 Um, but we've started him on antibiotics in case it's bacterial. 
 In case? I mean, are you guessing? 
 Listen, please. 
 Sorry if I'm curious about the health of my soon-to-be husband. 
 Is that a crime? 
 No, it's not. 
 It can be any number of things. 
 Let's get the labs first, and we'll go from there, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Sources say Alister's heroics extend even further than the trauma room. 
 In his personal life, Alister cared for his boyfriend after a leg amputation. Don't they have any real news to report? That was real news! Man, you are a hero! People like knowing there are guys like you out there. Yeah, too many people. Last day and a half, I've had random guys cyber hitting on me, women trying to convert me, conservatives hoping to shame me out of the military. Yeah, so now is probably not a good time to let you know that local TV channels and express have called like a hundred times, asking for interviews, huh? Tell them that I'm not talking to anybody and I just want to be left alone. Hey, I didn't say I was your secretary. Just letting you know what they said, man. Woman : Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. Rick, it's me. I don't know if you've seen the news, but if you have... Sorry you got dragged into this. I have no idea how they got that picture of us. I don't know how they found out about us, so... hope you well. So, Kaylee had what's called a grand mal seizure, [Phone beeps] .. but she's stable now. What caused that? We don't know yet. We have to run some more tests. Can I see her? Yeah. Uh, Jocelyn, can you... Can you join us, please? Honey! What are you... I'm sorry, mom. I can't stop. I'm starving. How can you still be hungry? You already ate a full meal. Kaylee, can I examine your stomach? Okay. I don't know what to do. She just keeps eating more and more, no matter what I do. What's going on? [Sighs] Boy : Faggot! You are such a faggot! Boy 2 : Shut up, man. Dude, why are you... Hey! What did we do? Watch your mouth. All right, drive fast, Krista. He's bleeding like crazy. Mm-hmm. Okay, pupils are equal and reactive. It's a good sign. Hey. Welcome back. Where... where am I? You were in an accident. Can you tell me your name? Joe... Joe Koller. Okay, Joe, you stay with me. My name's Dr. Alexander, and Dr. Bell-Hart is driving us to the hospital. We're gonna give you something for your pain. Good. 'Cause it-it's killing me. All right, Krista, look in my glove box. There's Benadryl. Hand it to me, and then tell me why. All right, so, it's an antihistamine, but it can be used as a local anesthetic. Do you need, um, a syringe? Yes. Here you go. You inject it near the wound, and it blocks the pain. All right. Joe, this is gonna burn a little bit, but I need you to be tough so that we can help you. Can you do that for me? Okay. Okay. Damn it. There's still no reception. W-we're a good 40 miles away from the nearest hospital. Just keep flooring it. [Sniffs] [Engine revving] And you just feel like you can't stop eating. You're... You're powerless? Because I'm always starving. So, you never feel full? Not really. On a scale from 1 to 10, my hunger level is a 20. Here you go, sweetie. Thanks. I know what you're thinking. You see me overweight, and you think, "like mother, like daughter," but I try to feed her fruits and vegetables. We're not thinking anything, ma'am. She started gaining weight when her dad and I split up. Her counselor at school thinks her overeating is a coping mechanism. We've tried everything... low carb, no carb, the zone. Okay, well, it sounds like you're doing everything right. We're only asking these questions so we can try and help Kaylee. Any illnesses, uh, surgeries? No. She's always been a really healthy kid. Actually, she has her dad's body. He's thin. And then... A few years ago, she, you know, started getting bigger. She's trying to say that's when I morphed into fatty pork chops. Please, K, don't talk about yourself that way. Hey, y-you really shouldn't. Let's just stick to the task at hand, which is trying to figure out why Kaylee's had her seizures. We're gonna run some blood work and an M.R.I., and we'll work it out, okay? You good with this? Hey, where do I know you from? Well, you've been in here about a dozen times over the past couple years, so I'd start with that. No, that ain't it. You're that guy. Yeah, I'm a guy. Open up. No, that guy that kicked that other dude's ass when he was shooting at people, right? Am I right? I'm right, right? Yeah, sir, you're right. Let's just stick out your tongue. Let's finish the exam. Uh, actually, can I have another doctor? Why do you want another doc? I don't feel comfortable having a gay dude touch me... Nothing personal. It gives me the heebie-jeebies. So, let me get this straight. You, a homeless drug addict, has a problem with me touching you? Yeah. I don't want you near my junk. You have a sore throat. I'm not going anywhere near your junk. I want a new doc. I'll put you back in the queue. [Gloves snap] Get you a new doctor. Mmm, this is nice. [Door slams] [Shouts] Hey, whoa, Drew! Drew, what's... What's going on, man? No good deed goes unpunished! You try to do something good, and the media, they grab it, and they just spoil it! What are you talking about, man? I just got kicked out of an exam room by a homeless guy. Why? 'Cause he didn't want a gay doctor touching him. I have treated that guy thousands of times! Didn't have a problem with it, but now that he knows... So what, man? He's just one deluded junkie, man. It's not gonna be just that guy! There's gonna be more. You know it. I'm just the gay doctor to everyone. So? How would you like to be the black nurse? I am a black nurse. And? What else you got? I just want my privacy back. I want my life back. I don't want any part of this. Look, Drew, look, I know you're a private guy, man, but I'm sorry. That ship has sailed, and I got to say, ever since you came out last year, it's like you still got one foot in the closet, man. So, what, are you some sort of expert now? I am on one of my best friends. And I know you got to stop hiding behind this privacy thing and step up and use this as an opportunity to let people know who you are, man. That's not who I am! That is who you are! That is who you are! Man, you served your country! You took care of your troops in battle! You're a doctor! You, my friend, are a caregiver from the very bottom of that thing beating in your chest, and you have a responsibility to be counted, a responsibility to fight this bigotry head on. N-not just for yourself but, more importantly, man, for those who can't. And that, I-I do know a little something about. We're losing his pulse. Bleeder must be in the retro peritoneum. I think his aorta is leaking. I'm driving as fast as I can. I-I need something to simulate an abdominal aortic tourniquet. I could use this seat belt. I need to apply pressure into the wound. You need something inflatable, right? Yeah. Okay, okay, that bag right there, um, I was bringing toys for my niece. I got her a water balloon launcher. Are you serious? Yes! All right, this balloon's going to work. I hope so. All right, stay with me, Joe. This is gonna hurt a little, but it's gonna help. [Moans] This should hold him for now, but I really need to open him up asap. Y-you can't open him up in the back. We'll have to do it somewhere, or he's going to die. Hey, guys. The prelim spinal-tap results do look like bacterial meningitis, but we're still waiting for the cultures. My God. You're already getting antibiotics, so you should start to feel better soon. His temp's going up. It's 106. Going up? Is he getting the right dose of the meds? Yes. My legs are going numb. Topher, is that normal? It's not bacterial. He should be responding to the antibiotics by now. What's wrong with him? We're gonna find out. L-let's give him steroids, and add an antiviral. You got it. Could it be something he picked up in a foreign country? Simone... Could it? Is there something you should be telling me? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. No, no, no, I'm not being quiet here. Okay, you came home, and you started feeling sick, so just... just tell him where you were. I know you were at Fort Bragg recently. Did you also leave the country? Brent, please just tell him where you really were. He was overseas. Simone, don't. He's special ops. He's not a-a Roving instructor. Oh, for the love of God, Simone. He won't tell me anything. He can't tell me anything ever. It's his job, and I get it, but this started when he came back, and now he's sick. I'm sorry, babe. I'm sorry, Topher, that we kept this secret. I understand. Look, right now, anything you say could help before it's too late. You know me. Nothing you say leaves this room. [Monitor beeping] Tell him. Please. My best buddy, Troy, and I, we were hanging out. Talking about how terrible the fake beer is. One thing I don't miss about deployment's the nonalcoholic beer. [Chuckles] Exactly. It all sucks. Our Humvee got hit by an I.E.D. [Sighs] Killed everyone. Brent... This is why I don't tell you things. [Sighs] I mean, I know I can't. Walked away with minor damage. [Sighs] I had shrapnel in my upper chest and my neck. [Sniffs] They got the metal out at the center at Landstuhl. How long ago did this happen? Six weeks. Does that help? Yeah. I think it might. We're gonna get you an M.R.I. and some more X-Rays. Okeydokey. Mr. Licorice and Mrs. Marshmallow are all set. That's one a day each after meals. You should notice a spring in their hop in no time. I need your biggest gurney and an O.R... now! 
 
 [Mid-tempo music playing] How did you get my number? No, I'm not doing any interviews. Stop calling me, and don't call the E.R. Because we're trying to get some work done here. [Cellphone beeps] Doctor Alister? [Cellphone buzzing] Man : Aren't you gonna answer that? Rick. So you recognized me. That's a good start. Yeah. Let me just get someone to cover for me. [Elevator dings] But do you eat anything besides grits? Why would I? Talking about cheese, bacon, green onions, with smoked sausage. Mmm! [Laughs] Mmm! Oh, honestly, I could eat that morning, noon, and night. Okay, okay. I'm serious. But next time, I'm picking the restaurant. As long as they got grits. All I'm saying. [Laughing] Grits. Emergency medic... Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, slow down, slow down. All right, who are you? Where? All right, got it. What's up? Jordan and Krista brought in an M.V.A. to an animal clinic out on 281. I need a MedEvac STAT. All right, I'm heading out. Call me with the address. I got you. Paging Dr. Statham. Dr. Statham, please. Just keep breathing, Kaylee. Only be a bit longer. Here's your lesson for the night, Paul. Never bring your bias into the exam room. All I saw was a girl with knee problems because she was overweight. Yeah, as did I. Her mom was right. I judged her and her mother. I just saw an obese girl eating candy and never considered there could be something more going on. Could've asked a hundred questions, and I didn't. Do you think you could've predicted the seizures? We'll never know, but I know we won't make the same mistake again. Such a cool kid. [Sighs] Son of a bitch. See that? Oh, man. [Sighing] Yeah. I called my owner. He said I can't let you guys in here. Pushing 10 of Morphine. Any Propofol? Uh, yeah. It's for the big dogs. It's over here. All right, hand it to me. Come on, 80 milligrams. [Sighs] [Dog barking] Hey, hey, don't go anywhere. We're gonna need your help. I can't. I just do animals. If it's an emergency, I call the vet. All right, sweetie, what's your name? Carl. Propofol in. All right, Carl, you're freaking out, and I don't blame you, but we need to help this kid pull through, or I'm gonna have to call his mother and tell her that he died. Now, tell me, would you want your mother to get that kind of phone call about you? Oh, no way. She'd go nuts. That's what I thought. So, you're just gonna have to take a very deep breath. Get a hold of yourself 'cause you are gonna help us save this kid. Okay, I'm in. Just... just don't make me touch anything. All right, Krista, you just finished your surgical rotation. Are you ready to do this? Hand me the 10 blade. Here you go. Okay now take the incision down to the rectus muscle. Deep breath, Carl. [Cat meows] Okay, so, you see this white area here? It's a tumor in her pituitary gland pushing on the hypothalamus. A tumor. Mm-hmm. Oh, my god, Kaylee has brain cancer. Oh, no, don't... Don't go down that road. The mass is probably benign, but it has grown big enough to cause some bleeding. It's also what caused the seizure, which is why we need to have it removed as soon as possible. But the good news is that we believe the tumor is the cause of her insatiable appetite. It's what's called hypothalamic obesity. That's good news? Yeah, the... the tumor's in a part of the brain that tells us when we're hungry and when we're not. We believe that's why she's always starving. So when it's removed, her appetite will return to normal. But brain surgery... I know it sounds scary, but they go right through the nose, and they take it out. It's relatively simple. This could fix her. It takes about an hour. Okay? I saw all the news coverage on you. Past couple days are so... On us. I meant what I said in the voice mail. I didn't give them the picture of us. I didn't... Drew... talk to them about us. I don't care about the damn picture. I can only imagine what hell the past couple days have been on you. Beyond my worst nightmare. Which is why I hopped on the last red-eye. That's why I didn't return your calls. I was flying. So you flew here to be with me? No, I came for the great hospital food. What do you think? Look... When I left, I had to get my life together. I did think some things through. Yeah, I mean, you've been through a lot. Yeah. Had to rethink, redefine who I am. Had to set things right with my parents. My mom, she always kind of knew. Dad, uh... He's getting there. [Chuckles] That's great. I mean, I know how heavily that weighed on you. You know what else weighed on me is us. [Sighs] I realized how much I need you in my life. I want us to be together again. So do I. But... But? Not like it was before. I'm out. My platoon... they don't care. I bled with them. I almost died with them. They're my brothers. So, what do you mean not like it was before? I mean, when we're together around other people. Okay, a-all my friends, they, uh, they know about you. I'm not talking about here in your safe cocoon, surrounded by your supporting friends. I'm talking about in the world. I'm talking about us... Standing 10 feet apart when we get a hotel room on vacation or not sitting beside each other at the movie theater or... Or holding each other's hand. I'm a private person. That's what I used to tell myself, too. [Sighs] God, life is too short. It feels so good to just live and not worry about what other people think. I want to be with you. We have to stop worrying about what the rest of the world thinks. I can't live like that anymore. I just can't. [Door opens] Kenny : Uh, excuse me, gents. Hey, Drew, I got a tool laceration for you in curtain four. All right, I'll be right there. Good seeing you, Rick. You too, Kenny. [Sighs] [Door closes] Anyway, uh... I said what I came to say. So... let me know. [Door closes] Oh, Toph, hey. I just got off the phone with the American embassy in Dubai. They are processing your visa, but they are still working on Ali's. Thanks for taking care of that. No problem. Any word on Jordan and Krista? No. Not since the guy from the animal hospital called, freaking out. Gwen just headed out, but that's all I know. Oh. Your trauma scans for Brent just came in. Come take a look. [Mouse clicks] All right, here's his chest X-Ray. Oh, wait, stop. There it is. See that? That's a foreign body. Brent was in an explosion. Nice shrapnel. That looks like bone. Good eye. It is. But you said it was a foreign body. Because it's not his bone. That's Troy. My god, how did that even get there? It's from the explosion, right? Yeah. I've seen a whole lot of things embedded in soldiers' bodies from I.E.D.s, but... It's called bio-shrapnel, which is probably the source of your infection. We need to get you to surgery as soon as possible to extract it and send it to the lab. So, he's... He's gonna be okay now? Well, he's not out of the woods yet. We need to do a blood transfusion. The infection caused your body to start breaking down. Which means we need extra blood on hand in case there's excess bleeding during the procedure. Correct. Oh, take mine. I mean, I-I don't know if I'm the same blood type, but I really... Honey, you don't have to. No, no, I want to. I want to feel like I'm doing something to help you, okay? It's okay, right, Topher? Speeds up the process. Let's get her set up. Okay. Okay, great. Love you. Okay. Suction. Okay. Man, if you guys hadn't been there, he'd be out there dying in the desert. I know. We leave five minutes later, five minutes sooner, hit traffic, stop for dinner, I mean, we never would've seen him. Okay, I found the bleeder. Apply pressure with the sponge-stick and hand me a satinsky clamp. All right, you clamp, I'll suture. Great. Whoa! Somebody call for a MedEvac? You are a sight for sore eyes. O.R. standing by. We should be there in 20 minutes. Good. Let's get him out of here. Done. That's great. [Sighs] Carl, you did great. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. S-so, you guys have boyfriends, or... [Both chuckle] Yeah, we do. [Dogs barking in distance] Unfortunately, even though the tumor removal was successful, the underlying tissue was damaged. So, what are you saying... Nothing's changed? Because of the damage, she will continue to gain weight, which will lead to more severe complications. How much more severe? Um... Well, she won't be able to control her eating, and if left untreated, she will... Basically eat herself to death. Oh, my god, what do we do? She needs gastric bypass surgery. It's a lap-band which constricts the stomach. It limits food intake and makes the patient feel full. Let's do it. The only problem is that there is a two-month waiting list here. Two months? You just said she's eating herself to death. I know. Well, can't you do it? It's a surgical procedure I'm not trained in. So I just have to watch her die? Let's go! Heading to the O.R.! Jordan, rough night? Yeah, I've had better. You should've seen your girl in action... total badass. Not so bad yourself. Hey, look, I got to get to the O.R., and don't think I didn't see your bike sitting out there. I-I told you I was gonna buy it. No, you said we'd discuss it. We can discuss it, but I already bought it. Okay, we will talk about this. [Sighs] Dr. Kaminsky. Yeah, uh, I spoke to your assistant who said your schedule for lap-band surgery is all booked up for the next two months. Life is good. Yeah, yeah. See, I got a patient who requires surgery right away. Uh, she's got morbid obesity causing heart strain. Could lead to failure. Be a big favor if you could bump her up. Yeah, stop right there, Callahan. I'm not a fan of your cowboy antics. And my surgery department doesn't work that way. Get in line like everybody else. I take it that's a no-go for getting Kaylee cutsies in the lap-band? I'll figure it out. Yeah, I put calls in to some clinics, but it may take a few days. You know, it's too bad you can't bribe him or blackmail him 'cause I hear he's a bit of a dick. Yeah. Toph. You have to see this. It's Brent's blood results. Hey. Hey. Brent's still in surgery? We just moved him to recovery, so you can go see him when he wakes up. Good. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you so much. Hey, Simone, there's something else we need to talk about. We know the meningitis is fungal, and fungal meningitis happens to patients with suppressed immune systems. I'm sorry. There's no easy way to say this, but... Brent has H.I.V. Uh, what? And, uh, your blood was screened when you donated. Simone... You have it, too. This is an unexpected bombshell, I know, but it's important to understand H.I.V. is no longer a death sentence. I don't... I don't understand. I mean, if we both have it, w-why am I not sick? Y-you may never be. Look at Magic Johnson. I mean, it's really just a... a sad luck of the draw. Is it possible that he got it from the bio-shrapnel from the bone? Right, we checked with military autopsy records, and Brent's buddy was H.I.V. negative, so he didn't get it from Troy. Okay. It's none of my business, and he could've contracted it any number of ways. But I know what it's like to be overseas, and... It's tough. Brent didn't cheat. He's a good man. I know. I-I'm just saying that being so far from home for so long and under pressure... Brent didn't cheat. I did. You did? Yeah, I did. I know, I know. I'm a horrible person. No, I'm... I'm not here to judge you. I'm... I'm here to help you. He's just... he's gone for months at a time. I never know when he's leaving, where he's going, or when he's coming back. We had to lie to our family, to our friends... To you and Janet. It's just... [Sobs] It's just so much pressure... That he can never talk about what he's done. I'm sorry. I know it's difficult, and this is a delicate thing, but you will have to tell everyone you've been with. It was one guy. O-okay. It was one guy. It was one time. I-I swear. Uh, just a couple of months ago, New Year's Eve. I just... You don't... I got lonely. I... It's okay. [Sniffles] What did I do? Oh, my God, what did I do? [Sniffles] [Vomiting] What's happening? She's been vomiting for five minutes. I'm thinking gastroparesis. What is that? It means she can't hold anything down. Kenny, give her Metoclopramide and Erythromycin. Yeah, on it. And they still won't move her up after this? Please. You've got to do something. I'll figure it out. I promise. [Sighs] Oh, sweetie. [Sighs] Jordan : Yes, well, he totally dodged a bullet, but he's resting comfortably now. Yeah. Uh, of course, we will absolutely let him know. Yeah. Okay, all right. Sure. [Phone beeps] [Sighs] Oh, man. Those phone calls are always fun to make. [Chuckling] Yeah. Jocelyn? Hey, what's up? Can I talk to you for a second? Sure, sure. What's up? I know you're pretty plugged into the gossip around here. Yeah, it's a fun hobby. Yeah, I bet. What do you know about Dr. Kaminsky? The lap-band surgeon. He's being a real dick to my patient, and anything you could give me? Come on, come on. Yeah. Yeah? Those two have a long road ahead of them. Nice couple. Just goes to show, you never know what's going on in other people's lives. Yeah. Hope they can work through it. Yeah. I don't know if I could. It's not your typical cheating situation. It's hard for the wives, girlfriends, and partners who stay home. They pay a price, too. Sometimes we forget that. I know I did. Really? You cheat? No. No! I... I was lucky to find Janet. I mean, I'm not blowing that. I'm just saying, you know, sometimes not appreciating your wife the way you should. You know, we're a team. [Clears throat] Ah. Callahan. I already told you... And so did my assistant... It's a two-month waiting list. Right. [Chuckles] Your assistant. She's cute. I hear you pay her to do little dances for you after hours. Rumor has it the nurses call you "Dr. Lap Dance." What? You don't have to convince me, but it's your wife I'm worried about. How much does divorce cost these days? [Inhales sharply] You son of a bitch. You wouldn't have the balls. Oh, I... I would. See, my patient needs surgery today, not in two months, so if you take care of her, I'll forget everything I know. If not... Gonna have to call your wife right now. [Paper crinkling] Get her prepped. I'll get to her when I can. [Garbage can opens, closes] Actually, she's already prepped 'cause I figured you would say yes. Jocelyn, Paul. You kept your promise. Damn right, and I will be there for your next play, okay? You better keep your mouth shut, Callahan. Oh, hey, professional courtesy. Thanks, Jocelyn. Anytime. He's a pig. Hey, so, I was thinking... [Chuckling] That could be dangerous. Oh, this is dangerous. This is very dangerous. Uh, my sister's coming into town next week, and I was thinking about maybe introducing you. Oh, the sister test. What happens if I fail? Does that mean you have to get a new girlfriend? [Chuckles] Oh, so you're officially my girlfriend now? It's a figure of speech. I meant friend who happens to be a girl. Okay. God! No, no, that's how I'll introduce you. "This is Gwen, my friend who happens to be a girl." Oh, yeah? [Laughs] Mm-hmm. Thank you so much! You're welcome. She's a great kid. She deserves a better life. Hopefully, now she'll have it. I'll check on her later. Okay. She'll be in recovery soon. ♪ Find out on your own ♪ 
♪ You know I know everybody ♪ 
♪ Sometimes ♪ Hey. Hey. Thanks for coming. Thanks for asking. You sure you want to do this? Yeah, I'm sure. Hello. Hi. Captain Drew Alister. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I appreciate you doing this. Please, have a seat. Okay, you all set? You ready? Yeah. Man : And 3, 2... I'm here with Dr. Drew Alister, the hero who risked his own life to stop the shooting from happening just a few days ago. Can you tell us about it, doctor? I just did what any other soldier would do. It just happened to be me, but I firmly believe that the men and women I served with would've done the same thing. My partner, Rick... would've done the same thing, as well. I was just trying to do what was right. And this man sitting next to you, your partner, army captain Rick Lincoln. Please tell me what went through your head when you heard the news? Uh, well, honestly, the first thought was, "that stupid idiot." [Light laughter] But, um... You know, of course, he behaved exactly like I knew he would. Train for these things, and he was... So, what are your big plans today, doctor? Well, I got my mom to watch the kids, so Janet and I are headed out for a picnic. Figure it's time to tell her about my trip to Dubai. That's my boy. Just rip the Band-aid off. No, no, you got to remove it gently. That way, you don't cause more pain. Anyway, it looks like your Band-aid's still on. She is not happy. I got to say... I'm on her side. Aw, get out. [Sighs] [Birds chirping] [Car door closes] [Engine turns over, car drives off] Hey. So, my motorcycle guy pulled through. Yeah. Thanks to you. I'm more worried about this motorcycle guy. [Sighs] I am not trying to change you. I just don't want anything bad to happen to you. Nothing is gonna happen to me. You don't know that. Okay, people say those kind of things, and then... You can't control the other guy. I love this bike. I love how this bike makes me feel when I ride it. I-I love working on this bike. But I love you, too, and, uh, how about a compromise? I'll only ride it on the weekends. Babe, this is not about the bike. I thought this was about the bike. [Crying] No, this is about responsibility, okay?! I have a child, our child, growing inside of me, and it is changing me! I am changing! And I thought it was just gonna be physical, but finding out that it is way, way bigger than that. Yeah, I can see that. I have all these hormones, and they're just raging and flying all over the place. I don't know. I was... I was out there today, and I just... I felt like this mama lion. Mama lion? Don't you dare make fun of me! Sorry. I saw this kid, and I saw his boyish face, and I thought about his mother, and then I thought about the fact that I am going to be a mother, and it all just kicked in. And I hate this bike! [Breathes heavily] And I don't want you to get rid of it if you don't want to get rid of it, but I want you to want to get rid of it and not because I asked you to get rid of it. So you want me to give up the bike? No. Are you even listening to me? Yeah, no, I-it's a good idea. [Cries, sighs] Just go home. Okay. [Voice breaking] I left my car at the animal hospital. Okay. We can just take my bike. You're not funny. No, I... I called a cab. You did? Yeah. Really? You did? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much.
