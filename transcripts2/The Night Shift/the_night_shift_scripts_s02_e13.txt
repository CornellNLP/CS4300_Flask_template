 Yeah, my man's a badass, huh? 
 That's Rick? 
 Yeah, training to be a combat instructor. 
 He runs the course tonight to see if he, uh, makes the cut. 
 I couldn't run that course with two legs. 
 [ Laughs ] You couldn't drive that course with a car. 
 Just face it, Paul. You know, you're just a house cat. 
 What does that mean? 
 It just means that you don't go out in the field and that you get thrown if you don't have the perfect conditions to practice medicine. 
 Okay, I thought Topher told you to cut it out with the competition. 
 Oh, come on, he can handle it. 
 Sorry about everything that you're going through. 
 I'm not going through anything. I got off easy. 
 Scott, it was an accident. 
 And because of that accident, a 16-year-old boy is looking at life in a chair. 
 Can't move his right arm either. He was a musician. 
 He's not gonna be able to do that anymore. 
 Well, what did your lawyer say about the lawsuit? 
 I don't know. A bunch of stuff. 
 Depositions and discovery, and I know I should care about that, but all I can think about is Malik. 
 But hey, look, you still have to take care of yourself. 
 Are you going to meetings? 
 Yeah, every day. 
 And, no, I still haven't had a drink. 
 Although I'm not gonna lie, it hasn't been easy. 
 Okay. 
 Well, if there's anything that I can do. 
 Yeah. I'll be upstairs if you need me. 
 Okay. 
 All right, everybody, listen up. 
 You guys all know that T.C. and Topher are still in Afghanistan, so that means that we are short two attendings. 
 But lucky for us, we have a new doctor to help us out. 
 I would like to introduce you to... 
 Dr. Michael Ragosa. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 I just got the e-mail. You passed your boards. 
 Congratulations, Doctor. 
 Wow. Thank you. 
 Congrats, man. 
 Congratulations. 
 Kenny : All right, guys, here we go. Listen up. 
 Sorry to break up the party. 
 Dispatch just called. 
 We have a big pileup on 90 west. 
 Drivers pinned inside vehicles. We need docs on site, stat. 
 All right, Drew, you're up, and take, um... 
 Me, me. I got this one. 
 Really? 
 All right. It's yours. Go for it. 
 Who's a house cat now? 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] Damn it. Just lost my signal again. 
 I'm amazed it worked this long. 
 Yeah. 
 Land that time forgot. 
 Yeah. 
 Just as nasty as I remember. 
 Thanks again for coming with me, Tee. 
 Hey, no problem. Don't worry. 
 We'll be fine. I brought lucky. 
 [Chuckles] I can't believe you still carry that thing. 
 Don't hate on lucky, pal. She got me through three tours. 
 I know. 
 Hey, hey. 
 You must be smalls' doctor buddies. 
 Topher : Yes, sir. 
 Riley. 
 Topher Zia. T.C. Callahan. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Fellow Irish. 
 You boys are a long way from Texas. 
 Yeah, so, we're here for Ali Nuristani. 
 He was our unit translator. 
 He has a... a heart failure, so we brought a pump to keep him alive until we can get him a transplant stateside. 
 Bad news. 
 His wife Farrah showed up here earlier. Said he's too sick to make the trip. 
 They took him to a clinic about 50 klicks down the road. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Let's go get him. 
 Sorry. Clinic's in a Taliban hot zone. 
 We're ghosts here. 
 Listen, this might seem crazy to you, but Ali, he's one of us. 
 One morning, locals brought a boy with a fever to my cash tent. 
 I examined him, lifted the blanket, he was strapped to a bomb. 
 Ali heard him say a martyr prayer, grabbed the detonator... 
 He saved 100 rangers that day. 
 That's right. 
 And we traveled halfway around the world to return the favor. 
 And if we don't implant the LVAD pump, he'll die. 
 All right. All right, let's ride. 
 Saddle up. 
 Wait, we're... We're doctors now. 
 We're not soldiers. 
 [Scoffs] Okay, Doc. 
 The Taliban doesn't care who you are. 
 Look, this goes south, we're all ending up on CNN with our heads cut off. 
 Come on. 
 We are back. Oh, yeah. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 I told you this was a bad idea! 
 Okay, okay! 
 Drew : Sara, what do we got? 
 Rachel and Devin Lawson, brother and sister, got sandwiched at 80 miles an hour. 
 Stable, ready to transport. 
 Man : Please! Over here! 
 Who's out there? 
 Haven't gotten to him yet. We're a little swamped. 
 I'll go. 
 Okay, you, you're with me. 
 Close back doors. Let's go. 
 [Whimpering] 
 Oh. Oh. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Whoa. 
 Okay. 
 Drew : Hey. 
 Faint pulse, but he's alive. 
 Let's get him packaged up and to the hospital ASAP. 
 Man : Thank God! Over here! 
 I got him. He's critical. Go help him. 
 Okay. All right. 
 All right. 
 Okay, okay. Stay calm. 
 I'm Dr. Cummings. 
 What's your name? 
 Sid Baines. My seatbelt's jammed. 
 I think I smell gas. 
 All right, Sid, do you have a child in the car? 
 Just dropped him off at my ex-wife's. 
 You got to get me out of here! 
 Yeah, okay, okay, okay. 
 [Grunting] Okay. All right. 
 Please. 
 [Grunts] 
 Ready? Okay. 
 [Screams] My leg! 
 [Groaning] 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Where's the clinic docs? 
 Taliban put a price on their head. 
 They had to scatter. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Ali. Ali, it's me. 
 Topher? 
 Yeah. 
 You're here. You saw Farrah? 
 Is she safe? 
 Yes, she's fine. She's at the base. 
 She told us where to find you. 
 I didn't think you would come. 
 I told you I would. 
 People say a lot of things. 
 [Breathes heavily] 
 But I shouldn't have doubted you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. This is T.C. 
 I figured. 
 Topher told me a lot about you. 
 Real pain in his ass. 
 Or maybe that was lost in translation. 
 We brought you some medicine. 
 Try to stay quiet. Save your strength. 
 Topher, looks like they had trouble getting the I.V. access. 
 We got to get his pressure up before we move him. 
 We'll start a central line. 
 Hey. We got a welcome wagon. 
 Maybe they need help. 
 No, we got to go. 
 If the good guys know we're here, the bad guys do, too. 
 He needs fluids running first. 
 15 minutes. 
 Y-y-you got 10. 
 [Siren wails] 
 Multiple victims coming in from the pileup. 
 First is one of ours. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Don't worry, sweetie. We'll take care of you. 
 What the hell happened? 
 He tried his best T.C. impersonation and got knocked out by an exploding car. 
 He has head trauma, altered levels of consciousness, and he's got a second-degree burn on that right hand. 
 Gonna be fine, Paul. We'll get you to C.T., clear your neck and head, and get you some pain meds for that burn. 
 Have someone drive you home. 
 I'm okay, Scott, really. 
 Paul... 
 Look, we're understaffed. I just want to help. 
 Better than me sitting at home looking at my burn all night. 
 All right, if the C.T.'s negative, then fine. 
 Kenny : How's mummy man? 
 Ejected through his windshield. 
 Multiple lacerations to his face and scalp. 
 We lost pulse on scene. He's been down 30 minutes. 
 Pupils fixed and dilated. 
 What's your assessment, Dr. Ragosa? 
 Uh, down for this long, sounds like D.O.A. 
 Most likely. Continue CPR. Give another run of meds. 
 If that doesn't work, call it. 
 Me? Pronounce him? 
 He's your patient. 
 Drew! What do we got? 
 Sid Baines, restrained driver from the head-on collision that caused the pileup. 
 Likely mid tibia fracture, closed. 
 Passed a breathalyzer on the scene. 
 Okay, Krista, Trauma 2. 
 Rachel and Devin Lawson. 
 The sister has head trauma, scalp laceration. 
 No L.O.C. 
 Brother has facial trauma with seatbelt sign. 
 Vitals are stable on both. 
 Okay, I'll take the sister in Trauma 1. 
 Drew, I want you to manage the floor, and any new incoming, you might as well step into those Chief Resident crocs now. 
 I like the sound of that. 
 Hey. I'm Dr. Alexander, and you must be Rachel. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right, so tell me, what happened tonight? 
 My brother and I are moving to Orlando from Hondo. 
 Hondo? Is that a real place? 
 Two stoplight town down I-90. 
 Guy in front of us slams on his brakes. 
 I hit him, someone hits us, and we just kept spinning and spinning. 
 It was scary. 
 Yeah, I know. I can imagine that it was. 
 All righty. Let's take a look at this. 
 All right, you're gonna need a couple of stitches, but you are gonna be fine. 
 So, tell me, who's in Orlando? Your parents? 
 My Uncle Tim. 
 My mom died giving birth to Devin and my dad died last year. 
 Lung cancer. 
 So, I dropped out of school and became his guardian. 
 That's tough. You're what, 18? 
 I was flunking out anyways. 
 I'll just take the G.E.D. sometime. 
 Still, that's a lot to take on. 
 I need to, uh, I need to check on my brother. Ow! 
 Whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. 
 Look, your brother is with one of our best doctors, so let's worry about you, okay? 
 All right. 
 Jocelyn, let's get her set up for a heat C.T. 
 Okay. 
 No. Thank you. I'm fine. 
 Rachel, you took a really bad blow to the head, and this is just gonna give us a snapshot of your situation. 
 My situation is I have 80 bucks on me. 
 Half of that is in quarters, and I don't have any insurance. 
 So no tests, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Why don't you just let us suture you up, all right? 
 And I want to see what I can do. 
 Uh, Jocelyn, can you get us set up for irrigation? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sonogram whirring] 
 Freaky. What's that? 
 That's your liver. Belly looks clear. 
 Were you driving an older-model car? 
 '71 Ford Maverick. How can you tell? 
 Lap belt injury. 
 They phased those belts out in the '80s. 
 Were ripping people in half. 
 What do you drive? 
 I'm guessing a Beamer, maybe a Lexus. 
 Rental. 
 A '71 Maverick, huh? 
 Must be a car guy. 
 My mom had it in high school. 
 I kept the car running, rebuilt the transmission, brakes. 
 I guess it's totaled now. 
 You did all that yourself? You're 14. 
 Yeah. 
 I looked it up on YouTube. 
 I like to tear cars down, see how they run, put them together again. 
 Yeah. 
 That's how I got my start, too, but we didn't have YouTube. 
 We had to actually read a manual. 
 Figure it out for ourselves. 
 [Chuckling] Okay, grandpa. 
 Grandpa? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey there. I'm Dr. Alexander. 
 I've been taking care of your sister, and I just wanted to see how things were going. 
 Eyelid laceration, corneal abrasion. 
 Other than that, pretty lucky. 
 Yeah, that's me. Lucky. 
 Yeah, well, your sister's pretty worried about you, Devin. 
 Worried her plan got ruined? 
 She's dumping me on my a-hole Uncle in Florida. 
 Yeah, she mentioned that things have been tough, and I'm sorry to hear that. 
 So, what's her solution? Bail on my ass? 
 To hell with her, then. 
 All right. I'll tell her that you're okay. 
 You always this angry? 
 Just since I was born. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Flatline] 
 Hold CPR, please. He's been down for 30. 
 Sharps. 
 Still pulseless. 
 No heartbeat. 
 11:57, time of death. Through a windshield. 
 What a way to go out, huh? 
 [Flatline] 
 [Monitor stops] 
 [  Dog barking ] 
 It's funny, Kenny. Real damn funny. 
 I didn't do it. I... no, it's his... it's his phone. 
 Medics must've missed it. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Uh, "Do we need eggs? Where are you? Call me." 
 Oh. 
 Oh, damn. His wife. 
 She doesn't even know he's dead. 
 Man. 
 I've got to call her. 
 Next thing I know, the other guy crosses over and swerves right into me. 
 I never saw it coming. 
 Ortho's coming down to set that broken ankle. 
 How's Paul? 
 He's got a nasty burn on his hand thanks to you. 
 You're blaming me? 
 You pushed his buttons. 
 He's like a little brother. He had to prove you wrong. 
 And he almost got himself killed doing it. 
 Okay, Sid, anybody we should call? 
 Boss, girlfriend, wife? 
 Ex-wife. God, no, unless you want to make her day. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Thank you. 
 [Groaning] 
 Belly pain? 
 Not from the accident. It's my Crohn's flaring up. 
 Are you kidding me? You were driving high. 
 No way. I'd never drive high. 
 Well, your tox screen says you tested positive for T.H.C. 
 Well, that was my Crohn's. 
 That flare up I was telling you about. 
 I go to Colorado to get medical marijuana for pain. 
 Otherwise, I couldn't work. I just do enough to get by. 
 Look, I get that it helps. 
 All right, it got my sister through chemo. 
 It's just she used at home, not while she was driving. 
 So, you may have caused the accident, which killed a man, and our friend was hurt saving you. 
 Okay, Dr. Bell-Hart. Just a quick word. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 You're a Doctor. 
 You're not a cop, you're not a D.A. 
 You saw his tox screen. The guy's high. 
 He's just trying to cover his ass. 
 Even if that's the case, it's still not your job. 
 Your job is to be a doctor and finish working up Sid. 
 Clear? 
 Crystal. 
 Hey. This the windshield guy? 
 Yeah. His wife had no idea. 
 Still doesn't. I had to call her to come in. 
 Oh, hey, uh, use these. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Yeah, nobody should have to see a loved one like that, you know? 
 Yeah. How you feeling? 
 A little woozy, but, um, all things considered. 
 Whoa. Look at that. 
 That's a bullet wound. 
 This guy was shot. 
 Stop wiping. Got to call 911. 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, this is Dr. Cummings from San Antonio memorial. 
 Need to talk to someone in homicide. 
 That D.O.A. from the pileup, I think he was mordered. 
 Toph, his pulse is weaker. I can't access the vein. 
 Any luck up there? 
 No good. Too collapsed from dehydration. 
 Hey, if we don't get his pressure up, he'll never make the LVAD. 
 No chance they got an ultrasound or I.O. drill? 
 They're lucky to have a working stethoscope here. 
 Let's go old school. Do a venous cutdown. 
 Dissect down to the saphenous vein directly. 
 Good call, Tee. 
 It's time to go, Docs. What are you doing? 
 I'm saving his life. 
 No, sorry. 
 We're out of time. We got to go now. 
 We're not ready yet. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Damn it! 
 T.C. : Get down, get down! 
 What did I say?! 
 Get Ali onto the floor. 
 This is Riley to base! 
 We're taking hostile fire! 
 Requesting drone backup at coordinates Bravo Mary Charlie! 
 Stay down! 
 [Gunfire continues] 
 [Gunfire] 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. You? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 They retreat? 
 Yeah, for now. 
 We're pressing our luck by being here. 
 See? Lucky saved us. 
 You and that stupid chip. 
 Stupid chip? 
 Before my first tour, my brother took us to Atlantic City. 
 I won 5 grand playing craps. This was from my first pot. 
 Good story, paddy. Don't care. You got five minutes. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. What are you doing up? 
 Oh, I had to go to the bathroom. 
 The nurse said it was okay. 
 Yeah, it's fine. 
 Hey, look, I got some good news. 
 I spoke with accounting, and they've agreed to do your scan Pro Bono. 
 So, it's probably gonna take another 20 minutes or so. 
 20 minutes? That was fast. 
 Well, I told you I'd work something out. 
 Hey, uh, Jocelyn? 
 Jocelyn : Yes? 
 Could you get her prepped for C.T.? 
 You got it. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on in. 
 Kenny : Jordan, more incoming. 
 Oh, my God, what happened? 
 Turns out my D.O.A. was shot in the head. 
 These two were shot a few miles from there. 
 GSW to the abdomen, GSW to the shoulder. 
 Drew assessed them. We are taking them to the E.O.R. 
 Cops think we have a sniper on our hands. 
 Sniper? No way. 
 I thought you had the night off. 
 I just got called in. 
 A flu bug hit the company really hard. 
 Now I think I know why. 
 Jordan. Curtain 3. 
 All right. Be careful out there. 
 I will. 
 Hey, I think you might've caught some of that sniper flu, too, all right? 
 Why don't you go back home tonight? 
 I can't. There's calls all over the North Side. 
 Gwen, listen... 
 No, all the shooting incidents are on the South Side. 
 The cops are setting up roadblocks. 
 Sick people need me, babe. 
 I got to go. 
 Sid : Hey. 
 Hi. How... how you feeling? 
 It's the Doc who saved my life. 
 Thanks for that. You hurt your hand? 
 Yeah, it's not that bad. I hope. 
 Uh, anyway, I just wanted to come in, see how you were doing. 
 Not great. That hot Doc is a hard ass. 
 Cops were in here asking me questions. 
 [Coughs] 
 I told them that sniper dude drove right into me. 
 I'm sorry for him, you know, but... 
 [Coughing] 
 Sid, what's... What's going on? 
 I can't breathe. 
 Okay. 
 [Wheezing] 
 Sid, your airway's closing up. 
 I need to intubate to help you breathe, okay? 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 Uh... Drew! Krista! 
 Somebody get in here, please! 
 Oh, no. He's coding. 
 I can't... I can't... I can't bag him. 
 Okay, okay. 
 What's going on? 
 His throat's closing up from soot inhalation. 
 I can't intubate with one hand. 
 If he burned his trachea, intubation wouldn't work anyway. 
 His pulse ox is down to 84. I'll grab a crike kit. 
 Too risky. He may be anticoagulated from Crohn's meds. 
 Heather, get me the fiber optic. Paul, you're injured. 
 We got this. Get me a 6.0 E.T. tube. 
 Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. 
 All right, come on, guys. Stats are dropping. 
 Move. 
 Okay, give me cricoid now. 
 Okay, come on. Where? 
 I see the cords. Advancing the tube. 
 Okay. 
 [Beeping continues] 
 [Beeping rapidly] 
 Stats are coming up. 
 92%. Nice save, Drew. 
 Yeah, should've never come to this. 
 Where the hell's Krista? 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing, Rachel? You're up next for C.T. 
 I told you I didn't want it. 
 No, you said you couldn't afford it, but now you can. 
 I can't, okay? 
 Devin and me, we're taking the last greyhound to Orlando. 
 It leaves in 30 minutes. 
 I'm fine, really. 
 Well, we need to be sure. Okay, it'll take an hour tops. 
 I just told you the bus leaves in a half-hour. 
 So catch another one. Rachel. 
 Look, I will put you both up in a hotel if your C.T. is clear. 
 What is the rush? 
 Devin? 
 Where's he going? Where are you going?! 
 What do you care? 
 I got us bus tickets to Orlando. 
 I'm not going, okay? 
 Devin, wait. 
 Aah! Ow! 
 Oh, stop yelling. 
 She's in pain. 
 Ow! [Groaning] 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me. 
 Oh, God. Oh, my... 
 Is she gonna be okay? 
 [Panting] 
 Can you tell me your name? 
 I-I-I-I can't. I can't. 
 Can you tell me his name? [Panting] 
 I don't know. I-I don't I don't... I don't... 
 She's having a brain bleed. 
 Devin : Rachel. 
 Call C.T. and tell Scott to prep the O.R. 
 I need a gurney, please. 
 [Grunting] 
 Hey, Paul, um, I just heard about Sid. 
 I can't believe I missed a burnt airway. 
 Yeah, uh, Sid is stable, but I'd avoid Drew if I were you. 
 Well, that's pretty much impossible. I just... 
 Thank you for covering my ass. 
 It was all Drew. 
 Couldn't really do much with my hand wrapped up. 
 I'm so sorry. I feel responsible. I forced you to... 
 How? You don't control me. 
 Okay, I went out, I got hurt. That's what happens. 
 
 
 
 Krista! I need to speak with Krista. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where were you? 
 Drew, I'm so sorry. 
 I was with Rick, and... 
 Rick? 
 No, he's fine. He came in. He just broke his blade. 
 Okay, so what about before Rick? 
 Your patient was pulled from a fire. 
 Checking his airway is first-day intern stuff, and you're supposed to be a resident in a couple weeks? 
 I screwed up. I know. 
 And you were pissed because you thought he caused the accident and you were wrong. And even if you were right, we treat everybody who comes through those doors the same, no matter what, you got that? 
 I got it. 
 Now, his labs show a metabolic acidosis. 
 Be a Doctor, run the labs, figure out why. 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Siren chirps] 
 The craniotomy we performed on Rachel was routine. 
 There were no issues. 
 Post-op imaging show no new bleeding. 
 But check this out. 
 Diffuse atrophy in her cerebral cortex. 
 She's 20 with the brain of an 80-year-old. 
 This has to be genetic, which means she's had it her whole life. 
 Her cortisol levels are barely detectable. 
 You know, maybe that's why she didn't want a C.T. 
 She didn't want us to know that she was dying. 
 Why would she want to hide that? 
 Yeah, that's a good question. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 Hello? 
 Excuse me. 
 Thank you for calling, sir. 
 I wanted to speak with you directly about your son. 
 You all right, Paul? 
 Uh, yeah, yeah. 
 I mean, can't intubate, I can't practice, but other than that, all good. 
 What you did was pretty stupid. 
 I wanted to save the guy. 
 That's the firefighter's job. 
 All right? 
 You save your patients by what you do here in the hospital, and if you ever want to be a surgeon, your hands are your franchise. You can't be rash in the field. 
 I guess I got a little over zealous, huh? 
 Yeah, well, sometimes we need to be shaken back into reality. 
 Look, I'm glad you're okay. 
 Thanks for the heads up. 
 I didn't get hurt. 
 I just busted my blade in the race. 
 Krista already called ortho to get a new one. 
 I didn't want to bother the chief resident. 
 You busted it, huh? How'd you do? 
 Well, I finished the course. 
 Ropes, tire, belly crawl. 
 Left it all on the field, including my leg. 
 That's great. I'm really proud of you. 
 But, Rick, just remember, the training program only takes the top 10%. 
 I just don't want you to set yourself up for heartbreak. 
 You know what's funny? 
 I don't even care. 
 I felt like a ranger again. 
 I think that's worth more than anything. 
 So, all this had nothing to do with me making chief resident? 
 'Cause I just I was worried. 
 I didn't know whether I should tell you... 
 Drew, you have to stop walking on egg shells around me. 
 I'm thrilled and proud of you. 
 Your wins are my wins. Vice versa. 
 We're a team. 
 I know. And I feel the same way. 
 I just... 
 I'm sorry for hovering. Old habits die hard. 
 Dude, you still don't let your sister drive, and she's 37. 
 She's a terrible driver. Somebody's gonna get hurt. 
 Keep telling yourself that. 
 [Chuckles] I got to run. 
 But you can crash in my office until your prosthetic's ready. 
 Oh, your office. 
 Look at you. 
 Perks of being chief resident. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey. 
 [Gun slams] 
 I hate this place. 
 Toph, take it easy. 
 Take it easy? Y-you could stand to take it less easy. 
 What did I do? Aren't you scared? 
 Yes. 
 Then why don't you act like it? 
 'Cause what good would that do? 
 So I don't feel like a coward for regretting to be here. 
 So, you wish you hadn't come? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Right. 
 I mean, Ali, I want to save him, but I-I'm feeling guilty and stupid for leaving my family. 
 Aren't you? 
 Yes. But I came 'cause I wanted to help you. 
 I wish you would stop saying that. 
 It... it... it puts all this pressure on me. 
 What pressure? 
 You're always reminding me that I-I saved you, I helped you. 
 That you would've killed yourself without me. 
 'Cause it's true. 
 Okay, but it makes me responsible for you. 
 I can't do that anymore, Tee. 
 I can't do that. 
 I-I have three kids that I have to take care of. 
 You don't have to take care of me. 
 You're here because of me! That makes me responsible for you. 
 If you die, if... if you get messed up again... 
 I won't. 
 You don't know that. You don't know that. 
 Stop playing like you're a cowboy where everything's gonna be cool. 
 You don't know. 
 Riley : Yo. The Humvee's 20 yards away, all right? 
 My guys will cover you. Stay low, run fast, don't trip. 
 Let's go. 
 Gotcha. 
 Look, Tee. 
 No. Just... Just get him on a gurney. 
 I want to get out of here and I want to go home. 
 I'm out of here in 30 seconds! 
 If you're not out here, you're on your own! 
 Topher : God, please get us out of here. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Come on! 
 T.C., cover me! 
 [Grunts] 
 I gotcha! I gotcha! 
 [Groaning] 
 Come on. Go. 
 Hey there. How you feeling? 
 Tired. They said I can't leave for a few days. 
 Well, you're gonna need some time to recover from your surgery. 
 This shot of cortisone should help you feel better. 
 So, when were you diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy? 
 I saw the brain atrophy on your C.T. scan. 
 My, uh, my pediatrician detected it when I was 5. 
 And my parents got pregnant and decided to have Devin for the bone marrow transplant I need to save my life someday. 
 So he was a savior sibling. 
 Then, you know, my mom died during labor, and... and he was just lost. 
 Right from go. 
 I'm sorry, Rachel. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, uh, have you had any symptoms? 
 Not until a few months ago. 
 So, why don't you ask your brother for the bone marrow transplant? 
 I didn't think he could handle it. 
 He's so angry at the world. 
 This is why you wanted him to meet your Uncle, right? 
 While you still can. 
 Look, Rachel, is protecting a lie worth dying for? 
 Because honey, that day is coming. 
 I've lied to him his whole life. 
 I can't tell him. 
 So let me do it. 
 This doesn't make any sense. 
 He should be breathing off the excess acid, but his PH levels just keep dropping. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Damn it. 
 We lost his pulse. Get a crash cart in here! 
 Come on. 
 Come on, Sid. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Dispatch said it was a cardiac arrest? 
 Yeah. Man down in a Ford pickup. 
 Are you sure we got the right spot? 
 [Gunshot, glass shatters] 
 Dispatcher : All units, 246. 
 Shots fired. 
 We have paramedics under fire at North Side Warehouse. 
 Believed to be sniper. Officer. Uh, where was it? Did they say what paramedic? Did they say what rig? Man : Not at liberty, ma'am. Part of our team is out there. [Cellphone ringing] What's going on? I thought he was stable on the vent. Coded from severe acidosis and I still don't know what's causing it. Increasing his respirations didn't help. Lab just called. Lactic acid is 25. 25? I've never heard of lactic acid that high. Yeah, it's like he's suffocating, but his blood oxygen level's normal. Wait. Wait, that's it. He's got plenty of oxygen in his blood but his cells can't use it. Open a cyanide kit now! Okay. Cyanide poisoning? Yeah. From the plastic burning in the car. Yeah. Drew : Let's get this in him quick. Come on, Sid. We got you. Cobalamin is in. Sodium thiosulfate is in. Hold CPR. [Flatline] Come on. I'm still getting nothing. Just give the meds a chance to work. Okay. Come on. [Monitor beeping] There. I feel something. So do I. Monitor shows sinus. He's back. Okay. That was close. Too close. That was being a doctor. We are hearing that a paramedic has been shot by the sniper on the North Side. No news on their condition at this time. Dispatch is just saying that one of them got hit. They don't know who. They're heading in now. Well, how can they not know? I don't know. I can only tell you what they told me. [Indistinct conversations, announcements over P.A.] Woman : Inhalation therapist to pediatrics nurses station. Inhalation therapist to pediatrics nurses station. Hey, uh... is that the first sniper victim's wife? Yeah. Yeah. They were, uh... Married two weeks ago. Postponed their honeymoon because of his job. Supposed to be in Hawaii right now. Hey, you... You okay? Yeah. It's weird. I... feel guilty about being upset. Don't. Telling the families is the hardest part of the job. Does it ever get easier? I wish I could tell you yes. Gwen! Fine. I'm fine. Jordan : What the hell happened? Got called into a setup. Son of a bitch coward shot Sara, blew our windshield out. Okay, let's get Sara to C.T. and call it to the O.R. I'm fine. It's just my arm. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. 'Cause I... Oh, not now, Kenny. I got to debrief the cops, but we'll talk about it later, okay? Topher : Hey, how's Riley? He's good. Through and through thigh wound. Be limping for a couple days. He'll be okay. How's Ali? Getting there. I'm suturing in the outflow graft now. [Monitor beeping] I'm sorry about before. You know, I was scared and I didn't want to die. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be here, either. I'm sorry I wanted to help you. That's not what I'm saying. Yeah, that's exactly what you're saying. Look, Toph, I get it. I came back from the war. I was a drunk, I was a mess. I was out of my mind. You don't have to... Look, you asked me if I was scared. You want to know what I'm scared of? I'm scared of hurting Jordan again. But I'm just not sure if I'm helping or ruining her life. Look, I... I love her, and she's my family, and yet I came here. I'm about to be a dad. If I die... That's what I'm scared of. Not being there for Jordan and the baby. I just want to go home. Yeah, me, too. You want to help me with this driveline? Oh, yeah. All right, let's start at 6,000 rpm. Okay. Hooked up. Come on, baby. [Device beeps] Flow is four liters. Nice job, Toph. You did it. Nice job. You glad you came back now? I am. [Electricity crackling] All right, let's put it in the chest, close it up, and get the hell out of here. Oh, yeah. So, she was born with it? She's had it her whole life? Yeah. It's a rare genetic disease that attacks your brain, your adrenal glands, bones. And it's only going to get worse. Why didn't Rachel tell me she was sick? Because your mom died. She thought it would be too hard on you. She didn't want you to worry about her. Why does everybody lie to me? It's not a question of lying. It's protecting. They told me my mom died when I was little. Then later I found out she died having me. When my dad was sick, he said he'd be fine, and six months later, he was dead. Rachel said she'd take care of me, and then tried to dump me on my Uncle then hide the fact that she's dying. That's not lying? Devin, I am so sorry. And I know that this must be... No, you don't. Screw this family. Screw everyone. Devin, wait. Listen to me. Your sister needs your bone marrow, or she will die. Yeah? Well, then she should've asked. [Sighs] Is he not gonna give Rachel the bone marrow? He's too angry. But if we don't get through to him, he's gonna lose her. [Sighs] You waiting on a ride? Don't even talk. I'm not doing it. Okay. If that's what you want. You have no idea what this is like. I do know what it feels like to question who you are. That part I get. I was adopted, and my parents were really great. Told me about it, talked to me about it. I even had pictures of my birth parents, so I knew what they looked like and had a sense of them, but... Anyway. But what? You wonder about your mom, what she was like, what your life would be like if she was still here? Of course. Me, too. Me, too. [Sighs] And don't get me wrong, I... I love my parents. I couldn't feel happier or luckier to have my family, but still can't help but wonder... What would my life be like if I had grown up with my birth mother. Did you ever meet her? She sent me a letter once. I was in my residency. And she wanted to see me. I was torn. I felt like I would be betraying my parents, even though they encouraged me to do it. I just... I don't know. Maybe I was... scared. Maybe I didn't want to be disappointed. So, what'd you do? I sent her a letter back. What'd she say? Well, that's the thing. I waited... Almost a year before I sent it. And by then... She had passed away. You do what you need to do, Devin. It's your life. But I can tell you there are some choices that are final. And you never get a second chance. And I got to say, I would kill for a do over. ♪♪♪ So, you want to move out of our apartment? Yeah, it's stupid to rent when we could own, and it'll be ours. Chief resident doubles my salary. I've been looking online. I am kind of tired of our neighbors and their yapping dachshunds. Yeah, is there a better reason to move? I want to kill those things. Seeing a lot of picket fences. And a swing set. Yeah, for the nieces and nephews. And maybe one day, I don't know. [Cellphone ringing] This is it. This is my commander. [Cellphone beeps] Captain Lincoln here. Really? Yes, sir. Very good news. You made it? Oh, you... Yes, sir. Really? No, uh... Thank you. Thank you, sir. [Laughs] [Cellphone beeps] I'm so proud of you. Power couple right here, right? [Laughs] Let's go look at houses. I'm just pumped. What's the matter? I, uh, made the top 1%. They want me to train the trainers. Are you kidding me? A promotion? That's even better! No, I-it isn't.
