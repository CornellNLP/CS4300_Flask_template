 Ah. 
 Hello. 
 How are you? 
 All right. 
 I got you something. 
 Ah, the key to your heart. 
 To my apartment. 
 Ah, big spender. 
 What'd it cost you... a whole dollar? 
 A buck 50 with tax. But, hey, you're worth it. 
 Nice. See now I don't have to use the one that's under the flower pot. 
 That is the one under the flower pot. But it's yours now. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Siren wails] 
 42-year-old male, full arrest status post electrocution! 
 PEA from the get-go. 
 Okay, okay. Trauma 2, come on. 
 Guy's a janitor working in an office building at night. 
 Had his wife and kids with him on the shift when he plugged in a floor-polishing machine, and wham! He got zapped pretty good. 
 That's okay. Prep an intubation tray with a MAC 4. I need an antecubital ASAP. One, two, three. 
 Thank you. 
 I got snakes in my throat! 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Yes! It's OK. Talk to me. 
 I've been here 12 times, and no one will treat me! 
 That's not true. 
 What's the problem, Sir? What's... what's going on? 
 See them writhing?! See them?! 
 No. I-I don't see anything at all. 
 Just calm down. Hey, hey, hey. 
 I-I... get them out of me! 
 Open your mouth. Let me take a look. 
 Open up, Sir. 
 I don't see anything, man. 
 Okay. Oh, yeah. 
 Ahh! 
 I see a copper head and a baby garter. 
 What? 
 Okay, look. We have to do a-an immediate snake removal. 
 I need Brevital, ringed forceps. 
 Sir, you just relax. All right? 
 Relax, okay? 
 Brevital, 10 milligrams per milliliter. 
 Okay Sir. 
 [Grunting] 
 Okay. All right. Settle down. 
 All right, look. We got about 20 seconds to do this. 
 Let's go. 
 Sure. 
 Yeah, w-what exactly are we doing here? 
 This man thinks that he has snakes in his throat. 
 If he thinks that he's been treated, he won't come back. 
 Seen this a million times. Let's go. Get it on him... 
 We have a couple of base jumpers at the Tower of the Americas. 
 One parachute opened, the other one... 
 Ouch. 
 Yeah. 
 ... did not exactly stick his landing. Tee, Gwen's already out there. I need you to... 
 All right, I'm on it. grab Chavez, he's free. 
 He's been bugging me to get out when surgery's slow. 
 Okay. Will do. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 All right. Muscle aches, chills, nausea... 
 Not a good night, huh? 
 I made her come in. 
 For nothing. 
 Seriously. I have an epic hangover and maybe a touch of the flu. 
 It was really nice of you to drive me down here, but [Chuckles] you totally didn't have to. 
 How do think I got "RA of the Year"? 
 Both : Regents Hall! 
 Um, she has a fever of 103. Heart rate is 120. 
 Okay, that sounds like more than a hangover, so we're gonna need to run some tests. 
 No. No, no, no. The only test I have is a major chem exam, which I-I haven't even studied for, so... 
 Let's go. 
 I can come back in if I need to, but... I'll be fine. Really. 
 Kyle : Lorelei! 
 Paul, get the Ambu-bag. 
 [Flatline] 
 He's V-fib! 
 Paddles to Dr Alister, please. 
 Clear. 
 [Electricity zaps] 
 Still V-fib. Charge again. 
 Charge to 200. 
 Clear! 
 [Electricity zaps] 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 Clear! 
 [Electricity zaps] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Strong carotid. Welcome back, Sir! 
 Man : Michael, can you go speak to the family? 
 Maria Hinojosa? 
 Sí Doctor! 
 No, no. I'm not the, uh... 
 [Conversing in Spanish] 
 [Speaks Spanish] 
 I speak English. 
 Good. 
 So do I. So you can talk to us. 
 We can translate. 
 Well, all right. 
 So you work with your parents? 
 Did you work with your parents, too? 
 We clean offices with them at night. 
 Yeah. Yeah, sort of. I-I, um... 
 I used to work with my dad and... Um... 
 You know what? I've got an idea. Why don't you come with me. 
 [Speaks Spanish] 
 Bumper pool! Can we play? 
 Of course. That's what it's there for. 
 Aw! I want to be a doctor when I grow up. 
 Mm. Me too. 
 Gracias. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Hey, right here. 
 Yeah, ah-ha-ha. Right here. Good. 
 What do you got? 
 Case of the malfunctioning parachute. 
 From the looks of it, he may have a spinal-cord injury. 
 I didn't want to move him until you guys got here. 
 Vitals? 
 I'm not sure... 
 I haven't gotten to him yet. 
 I can see why. 
 That's not him. 
 Over here. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 That's him. 
 Okay... Whoa. 
 Does he have a pulse? 
 Barely I'm getting this chute off. 
 How does he look? 
 Worst landing ever. 
 ♪ 
 Parachuting can bang you up pretty bad, even when you do it right. 
 I still feel some of my jumps. 
 I didn't do as many jumps as you did with the PJs, but my ankles are still wonky. 
 All right. One, two, three! 
 That why you do all that yoga crap? 
 Therapy? 
 Yeah. You could say that. 
 You know, I was gonna do some base jumping myself, then I made the mistake of telling Jordan. 
 That's what I like about being single. I get to do whatever I want. 
 All right. He's ready to transport. 
 Easy, easy. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, Lorelei. How you feeling? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Pretty good, considering I took a header to the floor earlier. 
 She has an elevated white count, but her UA and lytes are normal. 
 Ouch. [Moans] 
 Okay. And tender here, too? 
 Mm. Double ouch. 
 Please stop. It's making me nauseous. 
 I'm concerned that you have a gynecologic infection, so Dr Cummings is gonna do a pelvic exam so we can find the source. 
 [Chuckles uneasily] 
 Please tell me your name is Dr Cummings and that you like to refer to yourself in the third person. 
 I am not, but you'll be fine. 
 And I will check in on you later, okay? 
 Okay... Um... Nurse? 
 Let's get a CT, a chemistry, and a total CK to make sure he doesn't go into rhabdo... and have Ragosa tell the family, we're taking him for tests. 
 All over it. 
 Hey, buddy. I'm cured now. 
 No thanks to you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yo, Toph. 
 Uh, TC And Dr Chavez are headed back. 
 Got a possible spinal fracture. 
 Jump off a building, what do you expect? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So, uh, what... what do you make of this Chavez cat? 
 Great surgeon. 
 You know, he's... he's grown on me. 
 No, no, no. 
 I... I mean... I mean the constant downward doggin', the-the-the Kumbaya vibe. 
 Hey, I don't know, man. He rubs me the wrong way. 
 Think he might be down doggin' Krista? 
 No way, man. He's not her type. 
 What? Good-looking, ex-military surgeon who makes bank? 
 I'm pretty sure he's every girl's type. 
 Trust me... they're not doing it. 
 I don't know. People like to hide these things in the workplace. 
 Woman : Topher! 
 The electrocuted man's wife is in the break room, and she wants to speak to a doctor. 
 Okay, I'll get Ragosa in there to explain everything to them. 
 [Siren wails] 
 All right, rigid abdomen. 
 We're gonna have to get an ultrasound when we get to the hospital. 
 BP... 90 over 60. Pulse... 130. 
 Second liter wide open. 
 All right, when we get to the hospital, we'll get a trauma panel and a type and cross for 4. 
 Yeah. 
 Secondary survey's clear. 
 His best chance of survival is to fast-track him to the OR. 
 Let's do this. Will, you're gonna hang in there. You'll be all right, buddy. 
 Okay, you two. Line up. Here we go. 
 Boom and boom. 
 $5?! 
 Yes, and it's not to gamble. It is for snacks. 
 And don't spend it all in one place. 
 Why not? 
 I don't know. 
 That's what my dad used to tell me, but it never made sense. 
 Okay, have at it. Go crazy! 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 [Conversing in Spanish] 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Will? 
 Will? Oh, my God. Will. 
 Yeah, this is, uh... this is Kim, Will's, uh... 
 Uh, girlfriend. 
 Got a dog. 
 Oh, hey, pooch. 
 Max is Will's. 
 I-I took him out for a night hike, and I-I just came as fast as I could when I heard. 
 All right, listen. I'll take the dog. Don't worry... he'll be right outside, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Turn him round. 
 [Dog whines] 
 Is he gonna be okay? 
 Uh, he's in bad shape. 
 Look, I don't mean to be brief, but he needs surgery and we need consent. 
 Who makes his medical decisions? 
 Uh, me. I-I-I do. 
 Just, please, do whatever you have to do to save him. 
 Okay. 
 Ma'am, can you come with me? 
 Please, please. 
 [Sighs] 
 Um, could you... could you scoot down just a bit? 
 Good, good. 
 Uh, there's a... a-a tampon inside... there. 
 What? 
 Yeah, it's, uh... it's wedged up there, um, quite... quite a bit, actually. 
 Any idea how... how long it's been in there? 
 No. 
 Honestly, I-I remember taking one out, but... 
 I must have accidentally put a second one in. 
 F-M-L. I am never getting drunk again. 
 Um... 
 Did you know you have a rash on the bottom of your feet? 
 Yeah, I... I don't even know what that is. 
 But you should see our dorm showers. 
 Okay. Um, I think this may be toxic shock syndrome. 
 Is that bad? Th-th-that's bad, right? 
 Uh, I-it would be if we hadn't found it early enough. 
 Um, good news is, we did, so we can treat it. 
 That's a relief. Don't know how "death by tampon" would have looked on my headstone. 
 [Chuckles] Uh, o-okay. 
 Uh, you can get dressed now. 
 I'm gonna, uh, send the... the tampon to the lab for a gram stain and culture, and get you started on antibiotics. 
 Let's start with 600 of, uh, clindamycin. Um. 
 And, uh, yeah. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 You okay? 
 What's wrong? 
 Help! 
 Help! Mom! 
 Isabella! 
 Mommy! 
 Doctor! Doctor! 
 Start her on 5 of nebulized albuterol. 
 Mother said she had asthma when she was little, but she hasn't had an attack in years. 
 Okay, well, tell her stress can cause a relapse in symptoms. 
 Okay. 
 [Conversing in Spanish] 
 That's it, Isabella. You're doing great. 
 Big, deep, slow breath for me. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 Woman : TC! Out here! It's the brother. 
 Oh, what the hell? 
 It's getting worse! 
 Okay, Drew! 
 On it! Here, let's get him to Trauma 3. 
 This the girl's brother? 
 Yeah. 
 Man : This is getting weird. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 His buddy said that his chute didn't open. 
 He's lucky he hit that tree before he hit the bus. 
 Was there anybody in it? 
 No. Luckily they just park there overnight. 
 So, all told, could have been a lot worse. 
 Well, it's amazing there's no spinal-cord damage. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, God. 
 What is that? 
 Multiple masses. 
 It's... it's probably cancer. 
 You see these clumps of tissue? 
 That means that it's metastasized. 
 We're gonna take it out, right? 
 Not without consent. 
 I'm gonna finish cleaning the spleen and page an oncologist? 
 You should go talk to the girlfriend to get her consent. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Um, hey. So, the... the lab, um, says that the... the tampon was covered in semen. 
 Well, now we know how it got wedged up there. 
 Uh, right. So, listen, I'm actually not really, um, comfortable talking to Lorelei about it. 
 Paul, she's not your grandmother. 
 It's your job. Just do it. 
 You know how many infected penises I had to examine? 
 That's not funny. 
 Oh, I've got a dog to feed. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. 
 Hey, they like cheese, right? 
 Uh, dairy actually gives them gas. 
 I'm sorry. I guess I should have brought snacks for him, but I wasn't thinking. 
 Kim, can I talk to you for a second? 
 Is Will okay? 
 Um, we found something. 
 Hey, what about peanut butter? 
 You're not really a dog person, are you? 
 Uh. 
 Where is this dog, anyway? 
 He's tied up outside, fricking barking like crazy. 
 I'd be barking like crazy too if somebody left me out there. 
 You know what? Um, give him my sandwich. It's chicken. He'll like it. 
 Hey, so, uh, y-you can't talk to Lorelei? 
 No. You're gonna have to do it. I have a lumbar puncture. 
 Just remember, if you're feeling uncomfortable, imagine how uncomfortable she feels. 
 Okay, we got two sick kids. What did your exam of the boy reveal? 
 Benign abdomen, but persistent vomiting and diarrhea. 
 Sounds like a stomach flu. But no fever, and doesn't explain the girl's respiratory symptoms. 
 Maybe it's psychogenic. 
 Two different emotional responses to seeing their father's trauma. 
 Within minutes of each other? Unlikely. 
 I thought it might be food poisoning, so I asked the mom where they shop, who does the cooking at home, if they've been using herbs from a garden... 
 Way to take the initiative. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 And... ? 
 Oh. Uh, they eat the same thing every day. 
 But she did say that they've been really tired lately. 
 Probably from working at night as janitors. 
 Some people got to do what they got to do to survive. 
 I had a job at 12. 
 If it helps, I can run point on this... be the middleman for all the information. 
 All right, you got the job. Let's solve this. I hate seeing sick kids. 
 I'm gonna go check on him. 
 Yo, Toph. Uh, there's a call for you on line three about the base jumper. 
 Let me guess... they want to sue the city for putting a bus in the way. 
 Yeah. 
 What? How is that even possible? 
 Um... Right. Uh, well, it... it seems as though you... you accidentally had, uh, intercourse with the tampon in, which is... You know, then how it got lodged up there. 
 I mean, you're joking, right? I-I-I haven't even had s*x in like eight months. 
 Unless this was immaculate conception part two, this could not have happened. I did not have s*x, so how the hell did sperm get inside of me?! 
 She still has bronchospasm. 
 Try adding Atrovent. 
 You guys mind if I talk to her? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 We're done here. Later, gator. 
 There's a bunch of games on there that my daughter loves. 
 Cool! 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How's my brother? Did he really puke all over a nurse? 
 Oh, yeah. He got her good. 
 [Giggles] 
 But he's resting right now. 
 And so is your dad. 
 Good. He works way too hard. 
 It's time for you to rest right now, too, okay? 
 We'll have you all feeling better before you know it. 
 Can you send my mom in? I want to show her these games. 
 Yeah. You betcha. 
 Thanks. 
 So, the girlfriend said that he had cancer a few years back, but he's been in remission. She's pretty devastated. 
 This is tough. It's pretty advanced. 
 She wants us to do everything we can. 
 Great. Let's start the debulking procedure. Have you ever done a liver lobectomy? 
 No. No, I haven't. 
 Well, you will today. 
 We're gonna do an ultrasound first. I want to map the biliary tree. I don't want to leak any bile. 
 Dr Zia, what do we owe the pleasure... 
 You have to stop what you're doing right now. He can't have the surgery. 
 What? 
 You are not Will's health proxy. His brother is. 
 I just spoke to him on the phone. 
 No. Will's brother's lying. 
 He's not lying, Kim. 
 He faxed over proof. That's the health proxy and a DNR signed by Will three months ago. 
 He knew his cancer was back. 
 Why wouldn't he have told me? 
 I-I know this is hard... 
 You have to operate on him. I swear he would want you to. 
 I would love to operate on him, but I'm sorry. 
 I can't, okay? I have to respect his wishes. 
 I'm not letting Will die. 
 I'm gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna fight this. 
 This isn't over. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Hey, Rick! 
 Hey...  
 What are you do... 
 Hurt your leg? 
 Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. It's probably nothing. 
 Look, do you have a second? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, let me just, ah find Drew. 
 Actually, let's not. 
 I'm serious. 
 You fighting with Drew, or something? 
 No. Well, you know. I'm sure he tells you everything. 
 I don't know about "everything". You know, I'm sure it's an adjustment. 
 And... and, no, I don't mean this as in your amputation. 
 Uh, although it is. I just mean living together. 
 Yeah. No, it's... it's all an adjustment. 
 So, is it broken? 
 No, but it's a pretty bad sprain. We're gonna need to splint it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What? 
 I sprained my ankle. 
 Say it. 
 I sprained my only ankle. 
 Rick...  
 No, no. I'm messing with you. 
 I lost my leg, not my sense of humor. 
 I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm... oh, God. I'm just in work mode. 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Let's get you splinted. 
 [Winces] 
 Oh, hey. 
 Uh, do you mind if I take a look at your other leg? Just for a sec? 
 Yeah. 
 [Grunts] 
 I got it. 
 Okay. 
 You know what? 
 I would love to get Dr Chavez in here for a minute. 
 He's taking over Scott's surgical cases, and it would just be good to get him up to speed. 
 Sure. 
 All right. I'll be right back. 
 [Sighs] 
 He's our little secret. 
 It's far too cold outside for this handsome fellow. 
 Ah, he's so cute. 
 I know. 
 He reminds me of my old dog Cooper. 
 Don't you, buddy? Don't you? 
 Jocelyn, thank you so much. 
 No worries. 
 See you later, buddy. 
 Um, so, spoke with Lorelei. 
 She swears she hasn't had s*x in eight months. 
 Well, she might be self-conscious because you're a male doctor and you're close in age, so it can be a little... 
 Awkward? Yeah. Now she's getting really upset. I-I don't really know what to do. 
 Okay. Well, then, I'll talk to her with you. Come on. 
 Oh, now you'll talk to her. 
 I-I meant that in a good way. 
 Look, I told him and I'm telling you, I haven't had s*x recently. 
 You think I'm lying. I'm not lying. I've been living like a nun, I swear. 
 Okay. 
 Sort of. 
 Sort of? 
 It's okay. Whatever you say, it's between us. 
 The other night, I went to a frat party with one of my friends 'cause she was really into one of the pledges. And [Sighs] we were drinking, and someone offered us a pill, said it was Molly. 
 Okay. 
 I only took a little, but after that the night's a blur. 
 That's never happened to me before. 
 Okay. Well, Molly doesn't cause memory loss, so I'd like to run a tox screen to see if we can identify what you may have taken. 
 Okay. Hang in there. 
 All right. 
 She was a little more forthcoming that time. Uh, what do you think is going on? 
 I'm not sure. Okay, let's run the tox screen and see if it'll tell us something that she won't, okay? 
 
 
 
 Rick. 
 Hi. 
 It's Dr Chavez. 
 Hey. Good to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Krista caught me up. 
 How's the post-op pain? 
 Uh, some minor irritation, you know. 
 Well, that's... that's not minor. 
 That's a seroma. Those can be pretty painful. 
 I can handle it. 
 I'm sure you can, but I'm going to have to aspirate. 
 Which is just a fancy word for sticking me with a big needle. 
 Yes, basically. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Rick? 
 Rick : Hey. 
 Jocelyn told me you were here. Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, it's fine. 
 You hurt your ankle. Here, let me take a look... 
 No, no, no. It's okay. Krista took care of it. 
 She did? 
 I didn't know that. 
 So, how long have you been here? 
 Uh, he's got a seroma I need to aspirate, actually. 
 Dr Chavez, Topher needs to speak to you about the base jumper's health proxy and DNR. 
 Okay. I'll be right there. Um... 
 Ah... go ahead. I-I can aspirate. 
 Okay. Nice meeting you. 
 Yeah. 
 [Door closes] 
 I think I can do it. You've done enough. 
 Thanks. 
 Topher : I tried. We can't operate on the base jumper. 
 I just spoke with the hospital lawyer, the brother's lawyer, and Kim's lawyer. I never want to talk to another lawyer again. 
 Okay, well, Kim told me she thinks she can win. 
 Well, our lawyer says that she doesn't have a case. 
 If she were his wife, the law would see it differently. 
 Yeah, look, they've been together for years, okay? 
 She knows him better than anyone, and she says to remove the tumors. So... 
 We should remove them. 
 I agree. This sucks, but he signed the DNR without telling her. 
 That's for a reason. 
 How many times have we seen people sign DNRs, and as soon as they go South, the family's screaming to revive them. 
 If the brother was here, he might think differently. 
 You know, TC, I-I don't know about that. 
 Sometimes you see a family member in distress, and it makes it easier. 
 Not in my experience... how you fight until you can't fight anymore. 
 Okay, a-as much as I love a good debate, what we would or wouldn't do is irrelevant, so until we hear further, let's just keep him stable and comfortable, okay? 
 No heroic effort. 
 Doctors, we need you. 
 Isabella : Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Someone help her! 
 Has there been tonic-clonic activity the whole time? 
 Yeah. 
 Make it stop! 
 Okay, let's have 10 of Diazepam. 
 Okay. Hand me an Ambu-bag and place a line. 
 Can't get an IV on her. She's moving too much. 
 Okay. Give it to me. I'll go IM. 
 What the hell's going on with this family? 
 Come on. 
 All I wanted to do was read a book on the sofa, and the light went out. [Winces] 
 I was trying to change a bulb. 
 Wait, so you got up on a ladder? 
 Rick, our ceilings are 12 feet high. 
 Why didn't you just wait until I got home? 
 Because I'm your boyfriend, not your child. That's why I went to Krista. 
 I don't want you to have to...  Do every damn thing for me. 
 Just relax, all right? It's a light bulb. 
 Yeah, exactly. It's just a light bulb. 
 I was a guy who could practically build a house from the ground up. 
 Just gonna take a little bit of time to adapt. 
 To what? No, really. Adapt to what? 
 Forget that I'll never be able to lead my troops into combat again. 
 Forget that we'll never be able to climb Machu Picchu like we talked about. 
 Forget that I'll never be able to build a house from the ground up. 
 I can't even change a damn light bulb. 
 Do you have any idea how that makes me feel? 
 I know it's hard. 
 No, you don't. 
 You can imagine, but you don't understand what it's like. 
 Every day, I try to do something I used to... 
 I'm reminded I'm not that guy anymore. 
 But eventually you will...  
 Drew, stop. 
 Please. 
 Stop trying to make everything better. You can't. 
 I appreciate everything you've done for me. I really do. 
 And I love you. 
 And I love you. 
 Drew, I don't know who I am anymore. 
 I'm not the guy you fell in love with. 
 I'm not even a guy I like anymore. 
 I'm sorry. I can't do this. 
 Do what? 
 I'm moving out. 
 It's okay, Maria. You just had a seizure. 
 We're gonna run you upstairs for some tests. 
 Lorelei's tox screen came back negative. 
 Well, it's been 48 hours, so the drugs are probably out of her system by now. 
 Looks like her RA's back to pick her up. 
 Uh, what do we do? 
 I think we should talk to her again. 
 Um, I'll be right in. 
 Hey. I walked him around the block. He did his business. 
 Of course he did, 'cause he's a good boy! Yes, he is! 
 Thank you so much. I appreciate it. 
 Come on, buddy. 
 Hey, Drew. Do you want to meet Max? 
 No Okay. 
 Hey, Drew, you got a sec? 
 Not really. 
 Come on, Drew. Come on. Look, I'm sorry that I didn't come and get you, and Rick asked me not to, and I just didn't know what to do, and I don't want to be in the middle. 
 You don't have to worry about that anymore. 
 What does that mean? 
 Hey, Drew, I got a dislocated shoulder. Can you take it? 
 Can't somebody else? 
 They said everybody's busy. Come on. 
 Yeah, I got it. I'll talk to you later. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Dr Chavez, is that base jumper's girlfriend around? 
 His buddy gave me some of his things. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, um, no. He's actually not doing too well. It's getting complicated. 
 Oh, man. Okay, Buy you a coffee, tell you about it? 
 Kyle : So glad you're feeling better. 
 I never thought I'd be desperate to get back to my crappy dorm mattress. 
 [Chuckles] Oh, here. 
 Let's go, huh? 
 Oh. 
 Are... are you okay? 
 Well, uh, I-I feel a little shaky. 
 Um, maybe I should... 
 Sit down for a sec? Definitely. Come on. 
 I thought you said you were fine. 
 Sorry. Maybe it's just I haven't eaten lately. 
 Okay, I'd like to examine her, so if you could step out, please? 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 I'd like to check your pulse, okay? 
 [Voice breaking] There's nothing wrong with my pulse. 
 [Cries] 
 I just had a flashback of the other night. 
 It's still a little fuzzy, but... 
 ... I remember being at the party and being a little out of it... 
 And Kyle was there. 
 He walked me back to my dorm... 
 And he pushed his way inside. 
 I-I was too weak to fight him off. 
 He... He raped me. 
 Oh, honey. I am so sorry. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Crying] Please, you have to do something. 
 Just, please, do something! 
 He's crashing. Tachy and O² sats are dropping. 
 Diffuse rhonchi. He must have aspirated. 
 Get me an intubation tray. 
 No, no. No, he has a DNR. You know that. 
 Please, you have to help him. 
 Okay. 
 Tee, no. No, y-you hearing me? 
 He has a DNR. 
 So his brother can sue me, okay? I'm on Kim's side. 
 You can't just disregard what I say. I'm running this shift. 
 Okay, it's nothing personal. I disregard what everybody says. 
 Look, I-I'm not everybody. I hate this part of the job. 
 Then don't do this part of the job, okay? Do it your way, not the way you think it's supposed to be done. 
 So either leave and I'll say you were never here, or step in and help. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 I shouldn't have drank so much. 
 I shouldn't have flirted with him. 
 Lorelei, this is not your fault. 
 It doesn't matter how much you drank, what you wore, what you said, what you did. 
 If you didn't consent, he had no right. 
 That guy is right outside. Okay? 
 We can do an ARV kit, get that son of a bitch arrested. 
 Paul. 
 L-look, you don't have to decide right away. 
 Paul. 
 If you want to press charges... 
 Paul, stop!... The sooner we collect... 
 [Sighs] 
 At this point, nothing we collect would be admissible. 
 The chain of evidence was broken when you examined her. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 So he's just gonna get away with this?! 
 Evidence wise, it is a setback. 
 But we had no way of knowing. 
 We are going to do everything that we can. 
 Okay, I need to speak with Paul. 
 I'll be back in a few minutes, okay? 
 Paul. 
 Okay, you need to calm down. 
 This is not your fault. 
 Any one of us would have done the same thing. 
 Yes, it's terrible, okay? 
 But we have no way of knowing for sure. 
 But we do know, okay? She was assaulted. 
 I think she was too, but we are not the police. 
 We can call them, though, right? 
 That's not up to us. Okay, she may not want to. 
 Ultimately, it's her decision. 
 And, some people, they just need to take baby steps. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. Okay, okay. I hear you. I just... I don't like it. 
 I don't either. 
 So, you intubated Will. 
 I did. 
 You shouldn't have. 
 He didn't want to suffer, okay? 
 He signed the DNR. That was his choice. 
 Three months ago. 
 Who knows what he would have wanted today? 
 Actually, I do. 
 Gwen gave me his things, and I found this in his wallet. 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Paper rustles] 
 [Clears throat] 
 "You're my everything, Kim. I love you. 
 In time, I hope you come to understand my decision. 
 I didn't want to burden you, and I need my life to end the way I lived it... on my terms." 
 You were wrong, TC. 
 He didn't open his parachute on purpose. 
 He wanted to die. 
 We know what you did, prick. 
 What? 
 You're an RA. 
 You're responsible for the safety of those kids! 
 Instead, you go and sexually assault her?! 
 What's wrong with you?! 
 Assault? Dude, get off me! 
 She told us, okay? You walked her to her dorm and... and then... and then we hooked up! So what? Dude, she was all over me that night. 
 I was just giving her what she wanted. 
 Lorelei couldn't even tell you what she wanted because she was drugged. 
 But you decided what you wanted. You... you forcibly took it, right? 
 No. That's not how it went down. 
 Was she even awake when... when you did it? 
 I don't have to answer to you. 
 You're not going anywhere, okay? 
 Okay. Get out of my way. 
 [Grunts] 
 Hey! 
 Paul! 
 [People murmuring] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Paul : You son of a bitch! 
 Kyle : Get him off me! 
 After everything Kim's been through... 
 Now we have to give her the note. 
 She's in enough pain already. Why make it worse? 
 What do you mean? You're not going to? I mean, she deserves to know. 
 No. No, no. So she'll be wracked with guilt 'cause she didn't see the signs? 
 So she'll blame herself for something that wasn't her fault? 
 No, I know, but... these are his last words to her. 
 And sometimes the last words hurt the most. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, sweetie, I know you've been asking about your mom. 
 That was real scary what you saw. But don't worry. 
 The doctors are gonna take really good care of her. She's gonna be okay. 
 Isabella? 
 I can't hear you! 
 Okay, look at me. I'll be right back. 
 Why can't I hear anything?! 
 Give me one second. 
 Mr Ragosa? No. Mr Ragosa, please help me! 
 Hey, TC, Topher! The girl just lost her hearing! 
 Yeah. Okay, we're on it. 
 Can you talk to the mother? She's screaming about somebody named Rosario, but we can't find him. 
 I don't think Rosario's a person. 
 I think she's asking for her rosary beads. Check her purse. 
 Got it. 
 Get the keys and I'll check their truck. 
 You, tough guy, come with me. 
 I'm bleeding. I'm gonna sue this entire hospital! 
 For what? I didn't see anything. 
 Me neither. 
 There you go sweetie. 
 Okay. All right, first of all, you were like a junkyard dog in there, baby. 
 I mean, you really gave it to him. You gave him the one-two. [Laughs] 
 We... but we got to work on your left, all right? Your left isn't turning over. 
 Your left... what started that? 
 He raped my patient. 
 Wow. Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Good fight, man. Way to step up. I'm proud of you. 
 [Shoe thumps] 
 Woman : BP's dropping. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Her lungs are filled with secretions. 
 We have to intubate. Okay, push the ketamine now. 
 Her sats are down to 70%. 
 I think I figured out what's wrong! 
 I found farming tools in the truck, and the kids' boots caked in mud. 
 I think it's pesticides, probably from a second job in the field. 
 Pesticides. Vomiting, pulmonary edema, hearing loss... it all points to organophosphate poisoning. 
 Organophosphate is supposed to be banned. 
 Her sats are not coming up. 
 BP's down to 65. She's crashing! 
 We got to go with this. She needs atropine. Ragosa, take that. 
 [Rapid beeping] 
 IV's infiltrated. 
 Give me a spinal needle. 
 Michael, Betadine. Go. 
 All right, sweetie. Stay with us. 
 Topher : Come on, come on. 
 It's not working. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Yeah. There we go. 
 All right. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Wow, that was, uh...  
 Topher : Great job. 
 Glad you've been studying. You okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I just, um... 
 You got rattled. It's okay. If you want to be a doctor, get used to it. 
 Not something you can study for. 
 [Beeping continues] 
 Hi, Kim. 
 We had so many plans. 
 Whitewater rafting in the Chattooga. 
 Tandem paraglide in Cape Town. 
 We were finally gonna run with the bulls this summer. 
 I thought we'd get to all of it eventually. 
 Comes out of nowhere. Doesn't it? 
 My son spent the last part of his life in the hospital. 
 9 years old. 
 Nothing I could do for him. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Turns out, he was ready to let go. 
 But I wasn't. 
 It's the hardest thing, but you realize at some point... 
 ... they're not hanging on for them. 
 They're hanging on for you. 
 How do you know when to... ? 
 I've never seen anyone do it too soon. 
 Only too late. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hey, um, we found this. 
 It won't make it any easier, but may help you to understand. 
 Maybe Will wanted his brother to be his proxy 'cause he didn't want you to have to make the decision. 
 He wanted to take care of it for you. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Crying] That sounds like Will. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 He says they moved into a storage trailer on the farm where they keep the pesticides, but they didn't know it was dangerous. 
 So the farmer has been using illegal pesticides and this whole family and any person that eats those vegetables is being exposed? 
 That's... 
 Well, tell... tell him he's got to move his family out of there. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 Sí. 
 Sí. 
 Gracias, Doctor. 
 Gracias. 
 De nada. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks for your help tonight. 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 Like I said before, they could've been my family. 
 Yeah, mine too. 
 My dad was an immigrant who worked two jobs and still couldn't afford the basics. 
 Oh, what do you know? We actually do have something in common. 
 My dad worked construction. We moved 15 times in 12 years. 
 Had to go where the work was. Sure made it difficult to fit in. 
 So that's why you're such a dick. 
 Yeah. Must be. What's your excuse? 
 [Chuckles lightly] 
 [Dog whimpers] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Whoever says that animals don't have emotions? I mean... 
 I saw dozens of K9 teams in Afghanistan sniffing out explosives and work alongside the handlers. 
 They feel emotion as much as anyone. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know, she lives in a small apartment with her allergic son, so she can't keep Max. 
 You mean after all that, Max is gonna go to the shelter? 
 No, I mean, she said she found someone to take him. 
 Well, I hope it's a good home. 
 Thank you. Uh, I heard what you did earlier. 
 [Chuckles] It's nice to know there's still a few good guys left in the world. 
 There better be. I, uh... I have a sister. 
 Lorelei, have you thought about filing a complaint? 
 This happens to so many women at school, and nobody takes them seriously. 
 You just... Never think it's gonna happen to you. 
 Look, it's your call, but I will go with you to the Dean, the police, whatever you want. 
 And so will I. 
 Thank you. 
 And [Sighs] 
 I know that this doesn't make things right, but, um, I called a friend of mine at the local rape crisis center. 
 They have all the resources... both medical and legal. If you choose to move forward. 
 If you're not ready, it's okay. 
 But if you are, I'm free this afternoon. I could take you if you like. 
 Thank you.
