 Previously on "The Night Shift"... 
 I'm a doctor. We're gonna take this branch out and do a DPL. 
 Where'd you learn that? 
 Afghanistan. 
 Jordan : Medically speaking, TC is irreplaceable. 
 Ragosa : Everybody can be replaced. 
 So you either get in line or you are out of here! 
 Now we're even. 
 TC drives me nuts, but there's no shock there. 
 Sounds like an interesting story. 
 And it's a long one. 
 I know we're not together anymore, but it doesn't mean that I stopped caring about you. 
 I loved hearing from my new boss that I'm banging her ex. - Mm. 
 Thanks for the heads-up on that one. 
 [Grace Potter and the Nocturnals' "Tush"] 
 Listen up, everybody! 
 The night shift starts in five minutes. 
 You got five minutes, and then you're mine. 
 So let's bet a hundo each on the ducks, minus the 28. 
 Uh, ASU minus 4, LSU minus 12, uh, K-state plus 5 1/2, and the aggies minus 6. 
 Uh-huh. 
 If you lose, I'm not loaning you any more money. 
 I'm serious. I've got twins on the way. 
 My wife's gonna kill me. 
 I paid you back the $400. 
 You owed me $800! 
 ♪ I said, lord, take me down ♪ 
 Hey, Topher. 
 Dr. Alexander. 
 TC. 
 Hey. 
 Do you just look for opportunities to take your shirt off? 
 I remember when you used to look for opportunities  for me to take my shirt off. 
 I remember walking in on one of those opportunities. 
 You think maybe you could show me a modicum of respect as your boss? 
 Only when we're on duty. 
 ♪ 
 Ah, ha! 
 I don't know, T. 
 I think she's still into you. 
 ♪ Take me back ♪ 
 Kenny : [Grunts] 1, 2, 3! 
 Come on, Drew, 1, 2, 3! 
 Defensive roll! 
 Kenny and Drew : [Grunting] 
 You got a fight next week! You can't let the army down! 
 Finish hard! Finish hard! 
 Defensive roll! 
 [Laughs] 
 That's what I'm talking about, D. 
 What's up, Ms. Krista? 
 Not much. 
 Come on, show me what you got. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Show me what you got. 
 Come on. 2, 3, 2. 
 Krista and Kenny : [Grunting] 
 Okay. Not bad for a girl. 
 Uhh! [Coughs] 
 How was that... for a girl? 
 [Strained voice] That was pretty good. 
 Good one, Krista. Did I not mention that she trains? 
 Sorry about that. 
 [Speaks indistinctly] 
 Yo, Paul. Water. 
 Oh. Uh, yeah. 
 ♪ Take me downtown ♪ 
♪ I'm just looking for some tush ♪ 
 Incoming! 
 Paul : You... you want another one? 
 ♪ Whoo! ♪ 
 [Splat] 
 Ma'am? 
 I will leave when I am good and ready. 
 You are ready. You just have a sprained ankle. 
 A severely sprained ankle. Now let me finish. 
 Oh, and you need to get me a wheelchair. 
 I can't possibly bear any weight. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 The pain's a 10 out of 10. 
 Oh! 
 [Ring] 
 [Beep] 
 Get her the wheelchair. 
 [Chuckles] Hey, sweetie. 
 [Tires screech in distance] 
 How are you, hon? 
 How was school? 
 She... 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Tires screech] 
 40-year-old female with bilateral forearm fractures, open on the left. 
 Send a trauma panel and type and cross for six. 
 And someone notify ortho. 
 Kenny, Paul, you're with me. 
 Man : We got a stab wound to the neck. 
 Topher : Guess we know why he crashed, right? 
 Penetrating neck trauma, zone two! GCS 1-1-1! 
 Place two large bore IVs, set up for intubation. 
 Guarding in the left lower quadrant. 
 Tell CAT scan we're coming as soon as he's tubed. 
 TC, we have an officer-involved shooting. 
 GSW to the chest. 
 They said to tell you it's Deputy Woods. 
 Nick? Nick Woods? Call the chopper. 
 They're bringing him straight here in the cruiser. 
 All right, set up a thoracotomy tray and prep the rapid infuser. Let's get out there! 
 Can I go with him? 
 Don't look at me. Go, go, go! 
 So you fell off your bike? 
 Yes. He fell. 
 How fast were you going, bud? 
 Not that fast. He just fell awkwardly. 
 Ow. [Inhales sharply] 
 Okay. 
 Well, let's get some X-rays. 
 [Gloves snap] 
 I'll be right back. 
 How is she? 
 She has an open, comminuted Galeazzi fracture. 
 She's headed to the OR for a washout and internal fixation. 
 I'm guessing the ankle sprain is no longer our biggest concern. 
 Ragosa : I just checked with our lawyers. 
 Because she refused to get out of the ambulance before it was hit, she technically was not on hospital property. 
 So the hospital and I have zero liability. 
 She has to sue the city. I'm off the hook. 
 How great is that? 
 We should throw a party. 
 Lidocaine. 
 All right, let's see what we have under here. 
 [Whispers] Oh, man. 
 You still with us, Paul? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Good. 
 [Telephone rings in distance] 
 Turns out our friend here tried to rob a gas station, and the attendant wasn't having it. 
 So we get him to the OR, and tell the cops they can question him in a few hours. 
 Mollie : Topher, your wife just called. 
 She wants you to bring home some hemorrhoid meds. 
 [Singsongy] The magic is still alive! 
 So there's no way the kid fractured his arm falling off a bike. 
 The mom won't even let him answer. 
 But it's like he doesn't want to answer or he can't. 
 I don't know. Normally, I'd just call a social worker, but... I can't put my finger on it. 
 The boy just seems off. 
 Okay. Let's get a nurse to pull the mom out for paperwork, and we'll talk to him alone. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 TC : This is Nick. Let's move! 
 [Tires screech, siren stops] 
 EMS said the ambulance was 30 minutes out, so I brought him in. 
 Armor piercing. It went right through his vest. 
 I haven't been able to stop the bleeding. 
 He passed out about three minutes ago. 
 I'm losing his pulse. We gotta crack the chest. 
 Okay, come on. [Grunts] 
 I want 4 units running on the rapid infuser five minutes ago! 
 Send off a CBC, a chem-20, and grab all the O-neg you can find! 
 Hang on there, Nick. 
 And somebody call Dr. Flannery Mills at the cardiac institute,  and tell her to get her ass over here now! Now! 
 Insert the rib spreader and start cranking. 
 [Clatters] 
 How much do I open the ribs? 
 Till you hear 'em crack. 
 [Bone cracks] 
 Whoa. That's a huge heart. 
 [Cracks] 
 Not his original one. 
 He's been shot before. 
 [Gunfire] 
 We were in the same platoon in the war. 
 I had to find him a new one. It was a transplant? Yeah. From my brother. Okay. Suction, please. [Suction gurgling] Hey, what's up? It's Nick. Oh, my God. What... what's the story? [Flatlining] GSW to the left ventricle. I got my finger in the hole, but I need you to crossclamp the aorta. Clamp. [Flatlining continues] Put your finger where mine is. Yeah. I'm through the cords. 2.0 silk. Retractor. [Panting] Damn it. I can't get the angle. [Grunts] T, if this is too hard, we can do this. Suction, please. [Woman speaking indistinctly over PA] So... we need you to cover these cases to free up the attendings for the... uh, the real emergencies. Hmm? Uh, fantastic. I'm 100% ready. A-and listen, I, um, I'm more into diagnosis than surgery anyway, so, like... Well, then this is perfect. Does this hurt? Anthony, does this hurt when I touch it? A little. Where am I? You're in a hospital. Do you remember your mother bringing you in? No, not really. Can you remember anything about how you got hurt? Did somebody hit you? Did you fall? I don't know. You can tell us. It'll be our secret. I don't know. Where am I again? Okay. Hey, you wanna play a game on my phone? Okay. Multiple rib fractures, various stages of healing. He's been treated somewhere. Time to call Child Services? Not yet. They're too overwhelmed. They'll just bury him in the system. He's definitely been traumatized, physically and emotionally. By the mother? Possibly. Or a relative. But... something's clearly off. To find out what's going on, I need time to run an MMSE and APS tests. But I can't hold him with only a fractured arm. Unless, of course, there was another diagnosis. What if I were to admit him for concussion syndrome? I'll say he's complaining of nausea and headaches. We'll say it's from the bike fall. That'll buy you a little bit of time. That's great. Thank you. All right, I'll start a background check on the mom and then run the tests on the boy. Perfect. Uh, Mrs. Franklin. Hi. [Curtain rings swoosh] I am Dr. Cummings. Okay. Uh, well, what can I help you with this evening? It burns. Uh, what... what burns? Down here. I think that a-hole Charlie Knight gave me an STD. S-STD. Okay. Uh... You sure that... [Chuckles] Wait a minute. This is, uh, this is a joke. I know what this is, okay. Uh, Kenny? Kenny? Nice try, buddy! Nice... Uh, Kenny put you up to this, obviously. Do these sores look like a joke to you? Oh, my... [Exhales deeply] [Chuckles] [Flatlining continues] Come on. Come on. Let's go again. TC : Clear. All : Clear. Still V-fib. T, it's been 20 minutes. Bolus lidocaine. Let's go. Krista, increase the joules. [Machine beeps] Clear! Clear! All : Clear! [Monitor beeping steadily] Woman : I got a pulse! TC : Yes! You are not gonna die, Nick. Do you hear me? You are not gonna die. T? [Panting] What? Listen, you did great, but... He's gonna need a real heart surgeon to fix this or he's gonna code again. Yeah. That's why I had them call Flannery. [Woman speaking indistinctly over PA] Hi. Hi. Uh, listen. Is there any way somebody could take my patient or... or I could... No. TC. We're gonna figure this out, Debbie. We, uh, we stabilized Nick, but he has damage to his heart. Oh, God. We fixed the hole in his ventricle, and we're gonna get him on some medications to help his heart beat. Then I'm gonna fix whatever these butchers just screwed up. [Chuckles] Hey. Hi. Hey. [Chuckles] Dr. Flannery Mills, this is Dr. Jordan Alexander. Jor... as in Jordan Jordan? Uh, yeah. Ragosa : Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on a second here. Uh... we already have a cardiac surgeon on call. Who's not as good as Flannery. I am aware of your work with Doctors Without Borders, Dr. Mills. But you don't have surgical privileges at this hospital. I'm sorry. If it were up to me, I... I swear I'm gonna... Get your hands off me! Jordan : Hey! Hey! Stop it! Chill. Chill. [Lowered voice] Just take Debbie and Flannery in to see Nick. [Speaks indistinctly] Hey, what are we all standing around for? Let's get back to work. I can't just make it happen because the patient is his friend. She would have to be approved by the committee. It's not my call. I know. But it's not just a friend. TC's brother, Thad... was killed in action four years ago in Afghanistan. He donated his brother's heart to Nick. Flannery performed the transplant when we were over there. I didn't know that. It would have been nice to know that. [Whispers] You know how good she is. She's better than any cardiac surgeon we have. Just get the board to grant her the surgical privileges. You can do that. Don't let your issues with TC screw up Nick's best chance. Sir, you're gonna have to wait. We have several critical patients right now, okay? Well, I'm critical. I'm in pain. Come on, man. Not again. You have to go. Yeah, yeah, sure. But I'm having a severe migraine. And I came in once before for the same, and I got, like, a... some kind of headache shot. Once? Yeah, it started with a "D." Dude, stop it. I have seen you here at least twice this week. And I bet the day shift has, too. Now I told you last time, I'm not giving you anymore drugs. No one here is giving you drugs, all right? In fact, I'm calling every hospital in the area and making sure they know who you are. So get out and get into a program. Molly, can you? Can't we be done? I've been talking forever. I'm so tired. I know you are, Anthony, but just a few more questions. I need you to tell me about your mom and dad now. I told you, I don't want to talk about it. I wanna go to sleep. Is your dad still around? Was he mean? What about your mom? Is she mean? You are so pretty. I love your hair. Uh... thank you. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Me neither. I don't like boys. Well, I like Anthony. He's nice. But I don't like him like him. [Chuckles] Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. My brain is just so tired. I completely forgot your name. Who are you again? I'm Gracie, Anthony's friend. [Chuckles] So they get every American they can find to attend Rumsfeld's speech at the Kandahar base, right? And Rumsfeld's taking questions... God, I love this story. all scripted, of course. And this one here jumps up on stage and starts challenging him about the lack of armor for the Humvees. He throws a bag of boots on the stage that used to belong to soldiers who had their legs amputated. What? No way. When you've done your hundredth amputation, you see a pattern. Right? And Rumsfeld's limo in DC had more armor plating than anything in the war zone. Yep. [Laughs] Take it easy, Irish. I'm on your side. So they literally have to physically drag TC off the stage while he's yelling for more armor. So Nick and I jump in, trying to help him, and I get punched in the head by an MP guy. [Laughter] Flannery : The place went nuts! Every soldier was on his feet, cheering for TC. But then the next thing I know, he's being shipped back home, discharged from the army. It was political BS. If it had been your first incident, sweetie, yes. But you kinda went through your nine lives over there. Topher : Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't end up in the brig. Hey, Debbie, we're gonna try and fix Nick's heart, but there's nothing we can do about his ugly mug. Flannery : Oh! That's okay. I've gotten used to it. [Grunts] [Coughing] All right, everybody, let's give Nick some rest and me space to examine him. Clear out. Come on, guys. [Continues coughing] [Labored breathing] No matter what happens to me, you take good care of Debbie. [Whispering] That's a strong heart you got there. You're not going anywhere. [Coughing] And, uh, so, Mrs. Franklin, you say that you have had multiple sexual partners in the past six months? I'd say at least... eight. [Clears throat] There's a group of us that all sleep around together. You can only play so much mah-jongg, right? Yeah. Right, right. Okay. Well, uh, they should all come in to be examined. Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you? Uh, no. No, I-I would not. Um, listen, I need to take a-a blood sample, as well as a swab of your, uh, your sores and also your cervix. You better not take a picture and put it on the Internet. Oh. Uh, no. No, your, uh, v*g1n* is safe with me. ♪ Yeah, so TC and I met over there, and been bros ever since. Did you know his brother? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, actually, that's how we met. Um... yeah, Thad and I were in a platoon together. You know, we... we should let the nurses sit... - Oh. 'Cause they're on their feet more. Yeah, of course. [Laughter and applause] Krista : Okay. No, no. It's very funny. You glued a chair to my ass. [Laughing] We're gonna need that chair back, Krista. [Laughs] Oh, oh. Oh, you... oh, you want your chair back? ♪ That's okay. It's okay. [Whistling and cat calls] Everybody, take a good look... [Cheering] 'Cause I worked hard for this. Mm! Mm! All right. Enjoy this. [Loud crash] Oh! Man : Ohh! Oh, my God! Man : Whoa! What happened? Oh, it's... it's Topher's junkie. Son of a bitch. It's not bipolar or schizophrenia. It's definitely some form of multiple personality. Gracie is an 11-year-old girl alter. She comes out to protect Anthony when he feels pushed about something he doesn't wanna talk about. This is, uh... A picture she drew of herself. That's brought on by abuse? Definitely trauma related to something in early childhood. Could be physical, emotional, or both. But if he's showing symptoms at this age, it had to be bad. So what's the next step? I wanna try to bring out more of the personalities. If there's two, there's probably more, and one of them usually knows the truth about what's happening. But Anthony's sleeping now, so I have to wait. In the meantime, we're still waiting on the mother's background check. Okay, get Ragosa to expedite that. He is really good at cutting through the crap. Mollie : Jordan! We got a jumper at the food trucks, from our roof. What? Who? Topher's junkie. He made his way up there and took a flyer. Topher's on it. We also have four MVAs three minutes out. Okay. Let's go. 100 grams of manitol. And hyperventilate him. Where the hell is neurosurgery?! [Flatlining] I lost his pulse. There's no perfusion. I heard you! Krista, start compressions. Heather, push an amp of epi right now. Yes, Doctor. Come on, let's go! People, we're gonna do our best to keep him alive! Because God knows we didn't do very much when he needed it. [Heartbeat whooshing] Hey. You wanted to see me? Yeah. [Machine beeps] I can't fix Nick's heart. The bullet shredded the semilunar plane, the valves, the conduction system. It's amazing the heart's beating at all. So he needs a new one, which he will probably never get because this one was already a donor. I can put him on ECMO, try to repair the valve. Maybe that'll buy him a month or two. We'll get him on a list, maybe get lucky. But... I'm not optimistic. Have you told TC? No. I'm not sure how he's gonna take it. I've seen him spiral pretty bad. I mean, nothing like what you've seen or lived through with him. But... I thought that you should be here when I tell him. You know we're not together anymore, right? Does it really matter? 
 
 Hey. What's going on? Debbie, there's a... bit of a problem. Yes, we're seeing if you have any unclaimed DOAs. We're looking for a heart for a transplant. We're on every list. I need you to check by the border for any recent deaths. TC, I don't understand. He looked like he was doing better. Yeah. He... he's stable for now, but he needs a new heart. There was... there was... it was just too much. Oh. [Sighs] Not again, TC. He's not strong enough. Debbie... Why is this happening?! [Sobbing] He's a good man! He goes to church. He helps everybody. I don't know, Debbie. What am I gonna do without him? [Sniffles] [Whispers] What are our kids gonna do without their father? I'm begging you, TC. You have to save him. Please. Okay. Please? [Whispers indistinctly] Well, Sergeant, then get me your supervisor. Who called Child Services? Had to be a nosy patient. Everybody here knew what we were doing. Are you the supervisor? You know what's going on? Good. Good. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna get me that background on the mother in the next five minutes, or I'm gonna wake up every one of your bosses and I'm gonna tell them you can't handle your job. Okay? Then we'll see what... Good. Very good. Great. Thank you. It's on its way. Good, because so is Child Services. [Alarm blaring in distance] [Sighs deeply] Hey. Hey. [Pats leg] How's that kid doing? Mom's abusing him, right? I don't know. Not sure yet. He's too exhausted to talk. I wanted to tell you I spoke with Nick's wife. She's pretty much in shock. Yeah. Yeah. This... this is pretty tough on her. Oh, I would imagine it's pretty tough on you, too. She told me how close you and Nick are. Yeah. From the army, right? Yeah. [Whispers] Yeah. Look, TC, I get that... we keep things pretty casual between us, relationship-wise, but... that doesn't mean we can't talk if you need to... Hey, hey, Hey. I don't need to. [Siren wailing in distance] Okay? Maybe you don't need to. Maybe you just... want to. [Laughs] [Sighs deeply] Nick... Nick got shot in a... in an attack on our base, just before my brother Thad died. That must have been a terrible day. Yeah. Yeah. You know what's crazy? [Breathes deeply] We were getting back at... at Nick's shooters, and, uh, and that's what got Thad killed. He was pissed off about Nick. Well... and then Nick ends up with Thad's heart. So it felt like a part of Thad was still with you. Yeah. [Inhales deeply] Yeah, I guess so, until tonight. I should go check up on Nick. [Siren wailing] Man : Make way! Coming through! We got a multiple casualty MVA. A car ran a red light and plowed into the wedding party. [Speaks indistinctly] Bride's BP is 70 and falling... Head lac and an L-sided pneumo. The limo driver... Move her to trauma 2. Trauma 2 right in there. Man and woman : [Speak indistinctly] Okay, Drew, you're on the groom. TC, you take the maid of honor. I'll take the bride. Mollie : Limo driver... curtain 1, right over there. Get the maid of honor to trauma 4, down the hallway. I need you right down here. Okay, let's go. Come on, let's go. I want a 214 gauge antecubital lines, and set me up for a chest tube. How's the bride, Jordan? FAST is positive. Looks like a grade 3 splenic laceration. [Ultrasound whooshing] Call the OR. Drew? Multiple palpable fractures but no flail. Doing an intercostal nerve block now. [Woman speaking indistinctly over PA] Ah. So... I put a call into the state police to try to cut through the red tape to get information on that boy's mother. Thanks. I hate that part of the job. Let me know if you hear anything. Sure. Uh, listen. Uh, while I have you, I'd like to get your professional opinion of Dr. Callahan. He's an excellent doctor. Uh, no, no. I mean his state of mind. Any signs of PTSD? Well, everybody who was over there has some signs. Topher, Drew... I'm more focused on TC. The fighting, the gambling, the drinking, the sudden bursts of anger. Man, you really don't like him, do you? What is the deal with you guys? What do you mean? I mean, I've been working here a month, and every time you and TC are in a room together, you wanna tear each other's heads off. What is that about? You're doing that shrink thing. Somebody asks you a question, you turn it around on them to try to get information. Actually, I was just genuinely curious. But if you don't wanna answer, I get it. Nice try! I'll let you know if I hear anything from the state police about the boy's mom. Your daughter did have some internal bleeding due to a spleen injury, but she's gonna be fine. Man : What about Darrell? As is everyone else in your party. [Cheering and laughter] Jordan : Okay, all right. [Door opens] Kenny : Ah! [Laughs] Hey there, Paul. How'd it go? You knew she had an STD, didn't you? Of course I knew. Mrs. Franklin comes in a couple times a year with those sores. Gross. STDs are all over retirement centers these days. It's like a porno shoot over there. Oh, and, uh, Paul, there's more coming in who need the same exam. Oh, come on! [Laughs] Oh, and, Doctor, make sure you give 'em a real thorough pelvic exam. You wouldn't wanna miss anything, now would you? [Laughs] [Laughs] That's good. Oh, God. So... what's the story, Skeezix? That whore Wendy Franklin give me the clap or not? Uh, d-definitely... definitely, you got it. Got... Excuse me. Excuse me. Men : [Laughing] Kenny : Hey. What the hell are you doing? Shaving his beard. As a practical joke. He effin' loves this thing we've been trying for, like, three years to get him to shave it, but he won't. We even offered him... what was it? Like, 3,600 bucks to get him to shave it one time, and he still wouldn't. Come on. It'll be a great joke. My sister practically married him for this beard. It'll make everybody laugh. I mean, we all need it. It's pretty good. Okay then. Start... start shaving. Yes! Yeah! Man : All right! [Laughter] Man : Do it! [Lowered voice] All right. So what's the deal? Are you gonna break up with your girlfriend or what? I don't know. I-I don't wanna do it over the phone. So... you know, maybe when she gets back into town? Is that good for you? Seriously? Dude, I have it all set... Man : Whoa. Hey look. Man : What? What the... What? Jordan : He's only 12 years old. I didn't do anything. I would never hurt him. We have records from hospitals in Galveston, Lubbock, Oklahoma City. You're taking him to different ERs, so nobody knows. You need to tell us the truth now. [Voice breaking] I swear, I didn't do anything. His multiple personalities started because he is trying to survive something. Why didn't you mention them when you came in? What are you hiding? I'm getting out of here. I swear to God, if you are hurting this boy... Ow! Jordan : Who's doing this to you? Tell me what's going on or I'm gonna have you arrested. Temp's already down to 94 degrees. Turn down the cooling blanket. We wanna get it down to around 90. It's the best chance of preserving brain function. TC : Topher, you're still working on this jumper while Nick needs a heart? You gonna call this or what? No, not yet. It's been hours. His pupils are fixed and dilated. His EEG is flat. No response to painful stimuli. Just stop... stop doing that, or the hypothermia... - No, you stop doing that! There is no medical reason to keep working on this junkie! His name is William. I just... I wanna keep him hooked up until his parents get here, okay? Nick is not gonna get a heart, and you've got this guy who is brain-dead. This is not the battlefield, T. [Mutters] We don't have... we don't have to keep making these instant choices anymore. Nick needs a heart right now. And I know it kills you to quit, but... [Whispers] no matter what you do, you're not gonna save this kid. His brain was dead when he hit that truck. There is a waiting list, right? I mean, you can't just jump it, can you? There's a way around it. It's called direct donation. The family can decide who to give the organs to if he's not a donor. It's what I did with my brother for Nick. So I have to talk them into doing it for him now. Kenny : [Voice echoes] Heil, Hitler. [Normal voice] Hey. Hey, look who's waking up. I just wanted you to see the faces of the people who saved your ass. [Groans] [Breathing heavily] You shaved me?! Oh, God. I'm gonna sue you. I'm gonna sue all of your asses! Well, make sure you hire a Jew, because I hear they're really smart. Kenny : Mm. Yeah. Aah! Your wife's here to see you. [Sighs deeply] Guess she didn't know either. T, you cannot move a man to pre-op and start prepping him for a transplant without asking me. He... he has no donor card, and you haven't even consulted with the family. Okay, I'm not cutting him open. I'm just being prepared. Look, if Nick goes south, and his family says "Yes," then we can prep him faster. I just... I just wanna be a few steps ahead. You are way more than a few steps ahead. Look, even if the family gives consent, they might wanna wait weeks. Okay, months even. We don't know how long he's gonna be in this state. - Okay, I know! I know. I just can't... [Sighs] I just can't not do anything. [Sighs deeply] I'm gonna go talk to his family. I-I've been in their shoes. I had to make the same decision with my brother. Maybe I can get them to say "Yes." What am I supposed to do? Huh? Jordan, I... I can't just let Nick die. I owe him. I know how indebted you feel to Nick. [Sighs deeply] All right, he saved your life. Yeah, if I had stepped on that land mine... I know. I owe him, too, okay? If... if you had died over there, I just... You saved his life once. You gave him your brother's heart, and you gave him four more years that he never would've had. And I wanna give him a few more. I know. This whole situation, I just... I feel like I'm reliving Thad dying all over again. I, uh... I don't like how that makes me feel. I just... I thought I put it in here. I need to put it away. I don't think that... You could just bury something like that. Whatever you need, I will be there to help you. Mollie : Excuse me, Doctors. The jumper's parents are downstairs in the lobby. Okay. I'll be right there. Okay. Okay. Let me talk to them? All right, let me... just explain your situation, and then you can sit down with them and tell them your story. But, T, we have to do this in steps. Yeah. Okay. You all right? Yeah. [Sniffles] [Exhales deeply] Anthony, wake up. Wake up. We're arresting your mother. We know she's been hurting you. No. We are taking her away, and she will never hurt you again. No! Stop it! I said no! Landry : Anthony! [Objects clatter] [Shouts indistinctly] Anthony! Back away! Take it easy! Aah! Drew : Anthony! Aah! Anthony, take it easy! I'm not Anthony! Anthony's a sissy! Aah! Woman : [Sobbing] Anthony : [Screaming] Tell them, you bitch! Let go of me or I'll kill you! [Sobs] [Continues sobbing] I'm so sorry. You believe me now? [Handcuffs click] Child Services are on the way. We had to force the change in personality. Now that we know the problem, we can get him the help he needs. [Woman speaking indistinctly over PA] [Speaking indistinctly] Dr. Alexander. You knew about this? You were in on this transplant without permission? My shift. My responsibility. But it's my ass on the line, too, Jordan. When you took this job, you said you could keep him in line. It's only been two weeks. Change doesn't happen overnight. And I know that TC can be a huge pain in the ass. Trust me. I've been dealing with him a hell of a lot longer than anyone else. But if it were your family, wouldn't you want us to cut you some slack? Excuse me. [Woman speaking indistinctly over PA] Thank you. Let's go. Well, congratulations, ma'am. You're actually the only patient I saw tonight that did not have an STD, so... [Chuckles] Well, I should think not. I haven't had s*x in ten years. But what does this have to do with my stomach? I'm sorry. Your... your what? I came in because my stomach hurts. Right. Uh... well, it's all connected. [Clears throat] So... That was wild. I've never seen anything like that. [Elevator bell dings] [Door opens] Stuff with kids is always the worst. I feel horrible putting them through anything, but... You didn't have a choice. The mother could've been lying about the kid to protect herself. Mm-hmm. I mean, people lie to us all the time. Ah! So... [Claps hands] I just went over everything with the woman from Child Services, explained that the mom was moving around because she thought someone would take her kid away if they knew about his problem. Yada, yada, yada. And that we had it under control. All right. Well, chalk one up for the good guys. Anybody for coffee? My treat. I'll catch up to you later. All right. [Whispers] Okay. So, listen. Um... I just, uh, I want you to know that any time you wanna talk, I'm available. Talk? Yeah. Bounce things off me, sort things out. I know Latino men traditionally don't go in to therapy. Therapy? There's nothing wrong with me. Who said anything about wrong? I just see someone who looks like they're in pain and needs someone to talk to. [Loud clatter in distance] What the hell is going on now? Heather : It's a miracle, Doctor. We pulled the patient off the ventilator for the family, but he just started breathing on his own. Topher : Pupils are reactive. Start the rewarming protocol and order an MRI. He's responding to pain. One saline! Now! I've never seen this before. Woman : Please save him. Don't take him from me again! Please, God, give him a second chance. [Monitor beeping steadily] Topher : Let's get him to the OR! I swear to God, Toph, I thought he was gone. We all did. That's why we don't rush these kinds of decisions. Guys, the neurosurg attending is an hour out. Come on! We can't wait that long. We gotta get him into the OR and do the craniectomy. He's right. I'll tell Ragosa and the family. Okay. Can you get somebody to give me an update on Nick's surgery with Flannery? Got it. [Bell dings] I'll take the lead, okay? [Bell dings] You sure you're up for this? It's been a pretty rough night. You've never done one of these. I'm the kid's best chance. We got him. Yeah. Topher, I promise. I won't let you or that kid down. [Drill whirring] TC : I'm through the inner table. Suction that bleeder and increase power to the drill. [Whirring continues] Jordan : Ragosa and the family are all caught up. How's it going? Almost through the skull. How's Nick doing? Flannery just started repairing his valve. [Pager beeps] - T, I'm gonna help you beat down every door to get Nick another heart. I know you are. Call me if you need me. Okay, will do. Removing the bone flap now. [Whirring stops] Hopefully, by reducing the intercranial pressure, we can jump-start his blood flow. Nice work, buddy. I did way too many of these from Humvees driving over IEDs. I just hope it works, and this kid gets a second chance. Just do your best, T. You got this. Okay. Let's go. You're the one who should've known. He's your best friend. You should've known he was Hitler. She's your sister! You should've checked him out! Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Might I remind you, we are in a hospital. [Whispers] Please. Just keep it down. Sorry. But she's still in there with him. Can you go see what's going on? Woman : [Shouting indistinctly] [Exhales deeply] Woman : [Voice breaks] It's insane. Hey, hey, hey. Uh, is everything okay in here? No, it's not okay. Look at his stupid face. But while you're here... go ahead, Darrell. Tell the doctor what you told me. I got these things when I was into that crap when I was in high school. I'm not anymore. Not for like ten years. I didn't wanna get my face all scarred from removing them, so I just grew a beard. I swear that's the truth. I love you, honey bunny. Please forgive me. Do you believe him? Huh? Uh... I-I think what's important is if you believe him. You both should believe me. I've changed, I swear! Shut up, Darrell! And cover up your face. I'm just, uh... What else haven't you told me, Darrell? Are you in the Taliban, too? That doesn't even make sense! Oh, yeah! Like I'd believe a Nazi! So? How's it going in there? [Door closes] They're working it out.
