 [Man's voice echoes indistinctly] 
 [Gunfire] 
 [Shouting indistinctly] 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go. Get up. 
 Go away. 
 It's after 5:00. 
 You've been out all day. It's time to go. 
 And you got your butt kicked again. 
 I told you, if you gonna fight in that biker bar, you gotta keep your hands up. 
 [Grunts] 
 Hey. Any coffee? 
 Yeah, right there by that mint on your pillow.

 Man : Hurry up! 
 He's going into shock! 
 I'm coming, I'm coming. 
 We're losing him. 
 Do something. 
 I can't stop the bleeding. 
 Here, take out the branch! 
 Can't take out the branch. 
 He'll bleed out. 
 No, he won't. 
 Sir, get back and give us some space. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 We're gonna take the branch out and do a D.P.L. 
 We don't have enough blood to transfuse. 
 Yeah, yeah, get me all your bags. 
 A saline pack, a couple tubes, a needle and scalpel. 
 We're gonna go on three, all right? 
 One... two... three. 
 [Moans] 
 [Squish] 
 [Groans] 
 He's gonna bleed out. 
 No, he's not. 
 [Grunts] 
 His renal artery is cut. I'm gonna clamp it. 
 We're gonna use his blood. Start a line. Go, go, go, go. 
 Hang in there, buddy. Keep breathing. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 All right. When that fills up, take it off, pump it back into him. 
 Then we step up with a new bag. 
 Kind of like a bucket brigade at a fire. 
 Ready? 
 Holy crap. It's working. Where'd you learn that? 
 Afghanistan. 
 All right. Let's move. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 [Gasping and grunting] 
 [Monitor beeping rhythmically] 
 The defibrillator in your wife's pacemaker is malfunctioning, causing her to be repeatedly shocked. 
 So make it stop. 
 I can't. 
 We are contractually obligated to call the pacemaker company, and they send a technician over to reset it. 
 [Gasps] 
 So what, she's in pain the whole time until the tech gets here? 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just not gonna happen. 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Alexander, and I'm going to deactivate your defibrillator with a magnet. 
 Jordan, this is my patient. 
 Then you should have been the one helping her. 
 If anything happens, we're legally... 
 The only thing that's going to happen is that you are going to stop feeling like a horse is kicking you in the chest, okay? It's perfectly safe. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 There we go. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 There you go. 
 Better, right? Alright, so we're gonna get a tech in here, and we'll have that reset, and then you will be on your way. 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 Sure. 
 All right, let's go. Let's clear it out, guys. 
 Make a hole, please. 
 I need a type and screen and 2 units of blood! 
 Man : You got it. 
 You got real lucky taking that branch out. 
 Luck had nothing to do with it, Hank. 
 I heard about it over dispatch. 
 Hell of a way to start your shift. 
 Wouldn't have been my first choice. 
 Jeez, T.C., you look like crap. 
 Yeah, pulling a tree out of a guy's stomach tends to get a little messy. 
 I was talking about your face. Are you fighting again? 
 I didn't start this one. 
 You never do. Look, I really need your paperwork for the Drug Company study. 
 You know that I am trying to fund a extra position for the day shift, and you are a month behind. 
 Am I? 
 Yes, you are. 
 Look, the only thing that I need you to do is just take one day, all right? 
 One day to finish your paperwork instead of going out, getting drunk, and getting yourself in fights. 
 Hey. 
 [Hand thuds] 
 I'm done being nice about this. 
 [Chuckles] 
 This is nice? 
 You know what? 
 I am gonna ride you until I get that paperwork... 
 You've got a boyfriend, Jordan, so s*x with me is not gonna happen, but nice try. 
 You know what? You are so full of yourself. 
 Good morning/evening. This is very cute, but that... that's her. 
 I wish I did that. 
 Oh. 
 He's hungover... again. 
 Oh, come on, J. 
 I-I've seen you sucking on a bong like you were giving it C.P.R. 
 Whoa, that's nothing. She used to... 
 You know what? You shut up, all right? 
 And, Topher, that was ages ago. 
 T.C., please, just give me the paperwork, all right? 
 For me. 
 Got a 2-weeker. B.P. dropping, possible renal failure. Pulse down to 83 from 94. 
 I got it. I got it. 
 [Baby crying] 
 Mom says she has a congenital deformity with her kidneys, no wet diaper for two days. 
 Call pediatrics. 
 She's swelling. I need a bedside ultra sound, stat! 
 Okay. 
 Woman over P.A. : Night shift staff, report for duty. 
 All night shift staff, report for duty. You know, they say juggling helps improve your surgical dexterity. Improves your hand-eye coordination, trains you in pattern recognition and that... that sort of thing. That's great. You're, uh, you're Krista, right? Yeah. Paul... Cummings. Yeah, we met last year at the Intern Interviews. Talked about the M.C.A.T.s. You scored a 34, right? 35. Oh, I got, like, a 35.6. Good for you. [Indistinct conversations] I wouldn't be doing that, new guy. Oh, no worries, man. I know what I'm doing, all right? I can juggle anything. [Scoffs] Even junk from the lost and found, you know? Yeah. Yeah, that's not lost and found. Those are things the docs have taken out of people's rectums this month. Ugh. [Squeaks] Yeah. I'd wash my hands if I were you...35.6. [Chuckles] Yo, Doctor, the newbies, Krista and Paul, need to tag along with you until Dr. Knox is available. I wouldn't shake his hand... Oh. Exam 5, a 42-year-old man with lacerations on his testicles. Come on, man. I just ate. [Laughs] Wait until you see it. The guy "claims" he's cleaning his bathtub naked when his cat pounced on his swinging scrotum like it was a chew toy. [Inhales sharply] E.M.T.s had to drug the cat to get him to let go. Hey. How much longer do I have to wait? I've been here for over an hour. And you're behind people who have been here for two hours. I'm sorry. We're undermanned, and we're right in the middle of a shift change. We'll be with you in just a moment. I want to be seen now. Sir, I... I said now, bitch! Whoa. Hey! Hey! Sir, you need to... aah! Hey, calm down! Uhh! Hey, hey, hey, bubba, bubba, hey, just calm down. Come on! All right, we don't want any trouble, man. Aah! [Grunting] Don't fight it. Don't fight it. You're about to go sleepy time in about five seconds. There. Come on. Like a little baby. Get his feet up in the air. He'll wake up soon. Might wanna cuff him first, though. Thank you, Doctor. Oh, you're welcome. Security to the E.R. security... Mr. Ragosa? I haven't made my decision yet, Jordan. Okay, so... in the meantime, nobody's in charge of the night shift? They're talking about shutting the E.R. down. And I was promoted to make sure that doesn't happen, and when I find the right person... But I'm... I'm the right person. The night shift is not like the day shift. It's an undisciplined zoo. Last week someone stole my cell phone and sent erotic texts to my dentist. That's how they blow off steam. Half the shift is ex-military, so, you know, they work hard and... they play hard. Well, I don't like it. That attitude isn't gonna go away. We're surrounded by military bases. It's our workforce. But I see that as a positive, all right? They're already a team. They just need a focused leader. You've seen how hard I work on the day shift. Make me the chief of the night shift. Give me a chance to prove myself and keep this place open. What have you got to lose? Sir, uh, stay still, sir. [Inhales deeply] I swear to God, no matter how long I do this, it always freaks me out to be this close to a guy's shredded business. I'm gonna let you guys finish up the last couple of stitches. Who wants to go first? Oh, man, that's... that's really nasty. Mm, no. I'll do it. I've seen way worse testicles than these. Uh, ow! Sorry. Are you okay? [Grunts] [Wailing] What's the deal with pediatrics? We need to get her on dialysis. They're saying Ragosa told them we can't admit her. Dr. Callahan, please report to the staff meeting immediately. [Staff tittering] [Under breath] Wow. I don't need to tell you people that hospitals are struggling to stay open. With fiscal challenges, ObamaCare, we need to cut costs, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profits. And to help us achieve those goals is our new interim chief of the night shift, Dr. Jordan Alexander. [Scattered applause] Woman : Congrats, Jordan. Man : Whoo, Jordan! Look, I just wanna say I'm really excited to work with all of you, and we're gonna do some great things. For starters, we're going to be implementing a new administrative program using... These bad boys right here. They've really helped the day shift manage patient efficiency. All you have to do is enter the patient's information, their diagnosis, the treat... Excuse me. Sorry I'm late for your little pep rally. I had to take care of the baby. Did the ambulance arrive for her? I have no idea. I was busy, uh, setting her up for dialysis in pediatrics. You admitted her? I told him to transfer her back to Corpus. I determined that she wasn't stable enough to travel. She was fine. She could have gone. Is that your opinion, Doctor? Wait. That's right. You're not a doctor. [All murmuring] All right, all right, everybody, look, uh, meeting's over. Enjoy your shift. Thank you very much. [Indistinct conversations] I need you to override his diagnosis. Well, I'd have to examine her first. I don't... Well, do it now. Yes. Hey! Welcome to the night shift, Jordan! Woman : Aah! Get this thing off of me! Miss Pummer, you need to stop that. Uh, can I help you? Yes! Matt Damon is trying to kill me. You know Matt Damon, "Bourne Identity," "Good Will Hunting"? "The Talented Mr. Ripley." People always forget he was in that one. I don't know how people could forget. I loved "The Talented Mr. Ripley." It was so edge of your seat. So tell me something. What was your favorite scene? You know, it's so hard, because all of them and Matty is so... I love it when he sneaks into the room with Philip... ow! Philip Seymour Hoffman, and then when he gets on... the boat with Jude Law, and he's on there... Okay. Nice ploy. Thanks for picking up on it. [Grunts] There we go. I'm Jordan, by the way. We talked in passing when you started as the psych attending last month. Landry. And I know who you are. You're my new boss. I'd prefer "colleague." I'll take it from here. Thank you. So, Landry, if you need anything, please, just don't hesitate to ask. Are you kidding? I-I need a holding room, a psych nurse, better access to the pharmacy. You should have had these things your first night. Yeah. This shift is a little "Lord of the Flies." Landry, we need a psych eval. Exam 4. Okay, look, I'm gonna get you all of these things. All right? You do that, and I'll buy you coffee for a week. Deal. Welcome to our break room. [Exhales deeply] Paul : Look at this place. It's insane. [Chuckles] This is awesome. It's night shift only. We come up here on breaks, after shifts. Here's my advice for your first year. Just watch, listen. Forget all of that stuff you learned in med school, 'cause we're gonna show you stuff they didn't teach you. Do your best, and we'll see if you can hack it. ♪ T.C. is such a badass. I mean, he was an Army ranger, battlefield doc, top of his class at Johns Hopkins Med. [Laughs] Right? Oh, I googled him. I google everyone I meet, so... Yeah. I would keep that to yourself. Guys, we got a G.S.W. Drew, you're up. B.P. and heart rate dropping. Alright, what's happening in here? Simple G.S.W. I got the bullet, but he's still bleeding. You check for fragments? I got the whole bullet. Bone fragments. All right, give me the ultrasound. [Monitor beeps] All right, Drew, the bullet hit the bone. Bone fragments pieces travel. [Whispering] All righty. Let's go. Come on. [Squishes] There it is. Right there. Your spleen. That's the source of your bleeding. We need to get him to the O.R. [Gloves thud] [Crying] The dialysis is working. Call me if there's any change. [Baby continues crying] Tee, we have to figure this out. What do we have to figure out? You do your thing, I do mine. The only thing I need you to do  is to show me some respect. Respect is earned, Jordan. Everybody thinks you're Ragosa's puppet. Oh, excuse me. I am not his puppet. You're discharging this baby just like he wanted. After she recovers from her dialysis. If we keep her, what do I tell the next 50 people who come in here that we cannot afford to treat? I'll treat them. God, did you... did you not learn anything from being kicked out of the army? [Sighs] You are an amazing doctor, but for some reason, they thought that they were better off without you  during a war. What does that tell you? They care more about politics than lives. Do you not see how self-destructive you are? You deserve better, T.C. You do. [Door opens] [Lowered voice] Hey. Hey. I need your A.T.M. card. I'm a few hundred short. Why? Your bookie? Again? I may have lost a few. Uh... You really gotta stop betting on basketball, 'cause you really suck at it. Yo, Topher? Yeah? Uh, you got a minute? Eddie's daughter came in. She's having some stomach issues. Could you look at her? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Ow. [Moaning softly] Does that hurt? Mm-hmm. Sorry. Has it always been this size, or has it gotten bigger? It's gotten bigger in the last few years. I'm sorry to bother you with this. It's just been hurting so much lately. It's been hard to work. What have other doctors said? That I don't have insurance. All right. We'll get to the bottom of this. Sit tight. Thank you. 35-year-old female, unresponsive O.D. Two empty bottles of anti-depressants found on the scene. Start with the intubation. I screwed up, Tee. I got a simple G.S.W. I nearly killed the guy. Seen a million bullet wounds. I should've known. Battlefield wounds, not civilian. They're very different. You spent six months as a war medic. That's not nearly long enough to be a surgeon. Do the lavage now. To make matters worse, Jordan steps in, makes me look like a punk. You can't compare yourself to her. Jordan spent four years in residency in a Baltimore shooting gallery. That's worse than being in Fallujah. Jordan's the one I'd trust with my life. Okay. Great. So how's your first night going as the big boss? Pretty good, you know? They're a really great crew. Of course, T.C. drives me nuts, but there's no shock there. Oh. You two don't get along? [Sighs] It's complicated. Sounds like an interesting story. Yeah, it's a long one. [Elevator bell dings] [Doors open] So... Breakfast, okay? We'll talk. Great. All right. Hey. Is there something you want? Topher said to get Kara, the janitor's daughter, some blood work and an M.R.I. But the tech says we can't get them now until we get approval from Ragosa. She might have a-a tumor. Yeah. Okay. I'll take care of it. Yeah, yeah, okay. If you take away our ability to do the tests we need, we cannot diagnose our patients. Well, if the patient can't pay, then they get the minimum treatment. They just cost us too much money. Well, if all you care about is money, I can save you a ton. Just shut down the hospital. Then you won't have to treat anybody. Well, if we keep hemorrhaging losses, they will shut this place down. Oh, come on. We're the only trauma unit for ten counties. Where will people go? It's just not the way the corporation thinks. Well, that's how we think. [Indistinct conversations] Listen... You better change the way you think and start doing as I say. You see, I'm the guy who can save this place. You're the guy who exposes this hospital to a liability. If that tree trimmer died, do you know the lawsuit we'd be facing? So I should have just left him to die out in the woods? Don't try to turn me into some immorals bureaucrat. You don't know anything about me, and you broke every rule pulling out that branch. Every legal rule, not medical. It's all the same thing now. This isn't some cash unit in Afghanistan where you're the God. You're on your last chance,  so you either get in line, or you are out of here! Don't threaten me. Get out of my way. I don't get intimidated. [Scoffs] Oh, you see? You're not as tough as people said you... Uhh! T.C. Oh, he fell. Yeah. Okay. There's a multi-car accident out in Kerr County. Topher needs you to go with him. Chopper's out in the lot. Okay, uh, just get him some smelling salts. He'll be okay. [Chuckles] Hey, buddy. [Blades whirring] [Loudly] They say it's a really bad one, Tee! Let's go! We gotta move it! [Whirring continues] 
 
 Man : We're taking off. 15 minutes out. Man : The teenager said the pickup drove right into his lane! He's got minor lacerations! The other driver has broken ribs. We've got them covered! It's the kid in the S.U.V. We didn't wanna move him. That's why we called you! Help my brother! You have to help Matthew, please! All the doors are jammed! You gotta go through the sunroof. [Groans] Hey, Matthew. Hey. I'm T.C. This is Topher. Okay, I know you're scared. We need you to be brave, all right? Move your fingers for me. Yeah? Hey, good job. Good job. Okay, we're gonna take care of you. So we're gonna get you out of here. Be right back. Pull me up. [Grunts] How bad? His skull is separated from his spinal column. I can see 'em moving separately with each breath. Oh, my God. How is he still alive? By some miracle, the skull is being held in place by the neck muscles. But he's still got motor activity in his extremities, so the spinal cord hasn't been severed. We need to sedate him and get him out of here. He's got a chance. We need to fashion a mini body board to fit in there, and get some blankets. We need to... we need to improvise blocks to stabilize his head and neck, okay? Let's go. Hey, hey, buddy. Hey. We're gonna take care of you. [Grunts] Oh, it smells like my grandma's house. No, I can't believe we have to do this. Hey, I did it all last year. State law. When an old fogey croaks at a nursing home, only an M.D. can declare him dead. So they bring 'em here. Climb in. Check his pulse. Takes two minutes. Let's go, before we start getting busy again. Uh, hey, hey, wait. Wait. Um... I get to go first. Got to do the stitches, so... Because you were afraid. [Chuckles] I was... I was not afraid, all right? I was, uh, I was hesitant. There's a difference. [Clears throat] Okay. [Under breath] Go in there. [Exhales] Aah! [Screaming] Dude! Hey! [Laughing] You can open it. [Pounding on window] [Laughter] Hey! What is that?! That'd be your good friend Kenny. [Laughter] Yes. [Laughter continues] Yeah, I know it is. [Laughs] [Woman speaking indistinctly on TV] Whoa, whoa, where are you going? One of the admitting ladies said they couldn't do the tests 'cause I didn't have insurance. No, no, no. Topher told me you could not leave, no matter what. If anybody comes up to you, you just start gagging like you're gonna hurl all over 'em. Then run to the head and hang out for a while. Can you do that? I think I can. It has to be good now. We hear people gagging all day long. Okay. [Chuckles] [Retching] Oh. Okay, stop, okay, stop, stop. That was really gross. [Both chuckle] Look, you'll be fine. Steady... Steady. Let's get him secured. [Whispering] Hey, hey, hey. Hey. If this kid slips a millimeter, he'll be paralyzed and die. So no pressure, guys. Topher, here's nurse Ramos. Hey, Toph, our neurosurgeon is in Houston doing an operation, but he'll be here as soon as he finishes that surgery. Okay, good. Let's just hope we can get the kid there. Crap. Topher. [Boy whimpering] Gotta go. His lung collapsed. I need a needle to reinflate. [Gasping] [Wheezes] [Exhales deeply] [Exhales deeply] Ah, that was close. Just like old times. [Thunderclap] I got him. You're doing good, kid. We gotta get outta here in the next 10 minutes! A storm is moving in. Okay. Let's do this. Doc, I gotta put something over you guys. There's gonna be embers flying all over the place when we cut this thing open. I gotta keep him still and keep his lung inflated. Just put it over him. [Cranks] [Buzzing] [Whirring] [Thunderclap] [Retching] Woman over P.A. : Dr. Ganote, 2-2-8-0.  All right, everybody. Gather around. I got a few things to say. So I log on to the tablet program to see if any new patients' names are entered, and I find the following names... Dick Hurtz. [Hands slap] Anita Lay. Some young guy? [Coughs] Okay. Guys, you've had your fun, but come on. You have got to take this seriously. It has made the day shift so much better. It is amazing. Just... Is it true that Ragosa fired T.C.? It's all over the 4th floor. [All speaking at once] [Exhales deeply] What are we gonna do? You can't fire him, because medically speaking, he is irreplaceable. Everybody can be replaced. Not T.C. Oh. [Thunderclap in distance] I know him. Okay? I...I can turn him. I can get him in line. You just have to let me. This sounds like more than just a professional interest, Jordan. It's not. It's what best for the trauma department. Well, I don't think so. He's out of here. [Blades whirring] Somebody get me a status on that surgeon! Callahan, you're fired! Get your things and get your ass out of here in 10 minutes! T.C. : Screw you, Ragosa! Did you approve that M.R.I. for me?! No! She has no insurance! I know she doesn't! That's why I asked you to approve it! Take her to the clinic. She'll have to wait six months if she goes to the clinic! She could be dead by then! Why is it so hard for you people to understand that if we keep treating everybody for free, we will go bankrupt? Because we're the ones dealing with the people, not you! So, is, um, T.C. really gone? I don't know. I don't wanna think about it. Come on. Let's do this before someone walks in on us, please. [Defibrillator whines] [Together]: Clear. [Paddles thunk] [Gasps] All right. There we go. Trust me. You don't want your first time being on someone who really needs it. Paul, you're up. Wait. We don't... We didn't do things... things like this at Columbia. Yeah, well, not all of us could afford to go to the fancy med schools. I went to U.S.H. Is that in the Caribbean? That'd be the Uniformed Services Hospital. It's for military. I was a medic. I was good at it, so the army put me through Med school. How long do you have to serve to pay 'em back? I owe 'em 10 years, but I'm in it for life. No debt. I get to be a surgeon. Sweet deal. Paul, this guy's really dead, so hit him. So I hear you fight mixed martial arts. I love watching that. Yeah. I do it when I can. It's a fun hobby. Paul, come on. Now. Clear. Clear. Whoa! Watch it! Sorry. Sorry. Um, it's sorry. Ragosa nixed the M.R.I. for Kara. I don't have much time. I need to know where she is. Kenny's got her stashed in the head. Thanks. [Whizzing and beeping] Hey, Dwayne. What do you want from me? Um, I need a favor. No kidding. You're talking to me. [Huffs] I-I need a scan for that girl over there. She doesn't have insurance. [Whispers]: She might she might have a tumor. Hate to see a hot girl die. Okay, if I do this, you owe me. All right, whatever you want. Oh, I want liposuction, here, here, and here. Mm, dude, I'm not a plastic surgeon. But you know some. Get me the lipo, I'll get you the M.R.I. All right, just... just... don't do that. [Huffs] $2,500 for lipo? It's a good deal. I'm not giving you 2,500 bucks. This girl could die. Have a heart. What... what else can I do for you? Oh! Spurs tickets. I already have courtside seats, and I make way more than you, so you can't bribe me. But... You know that hot new intern? Set me up with her. Krista? Yeah. [Chuckles] She's way out of your league, man. I mean, let's start small. How about I buy you a blowup doll? Date with Krista or no lipo. Okay. This is kind of weird, but... but I'm just gonna spit it out. I need you to go on a date with a plastic surgeon so he'll perform lipo on a M.R.I. tech who will then give Kara the M.R.I. to see if she has a tumor. You have to be kidding me. I-I wish I was, but I pretty much need to know right now if we're gonna get her in there. Wow. I am so glad I went to medical school.

[Inhales sharply] He was in a Humvee accident near Kandahar. Same injury as this boy. I had to operate on him. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. You did a spinal decapitation surgery in a tent?

He was the one who was driving. Poor thing is so upset. Thanks. I'll talk to him. Yeah. His mother's on the way. If his little brother doesn't recover, he may never get over the guilt of this. Unbelievable. This guy's got a .38 alcohol level, creams another car, and he only ends up with a black eye and a boo-boo neck. Get him to recovery. [Flatline tone] Time of death... 3:27. [Flatline continues] [Tone stops] You did your best, Doctor. [Gloves snap] [Under breath]: Damn drunk drivers. [Monitor beeping steadily] Topher : Is this the drunk driver? Man : Yep. [Exhales deeply] Sir? You with me? Mm-hmm. Oh. Oh, so... Oh, so you know that, um, this button in your hand controls the morphine from this machine that's next to your bed. It's to... it's to help ease your pain. [Grunts] Button. Morphine. Pain. T.C. : Tell them to prep the O.R. for the boy. Woman : Yes, Doctor. Ragosa : What's going on here? His bladder has emptied. He's lost control of his extremities. We need to get him to the O.R. before the paralysis is permanent. The neurosurgeon isn't here yet. He's still stuck in Houston. We can't wait. Just stay out of my way. I don't have time to explain how this operation works to you. We have major liability here, Jordan. Has T.C. ever performed one of these before? Yes, in Afghanistan. And? He did it. Excuse me. Matthew was my responsibility. [Voice breaking]: I was supposed to protect him, and now I might have killed my little brother. Tommy, look at me. Look at me. Your brother is alive right now because of you. The deputy said that you would both be dead if the accident had been head on. Your reflex saved Matthew. And then despite being in shock and injured yourself, you crawled to the highway, called 9-1-1. This was not your fault. Do you understand that? Look me in the eye and tell me you understand. I understand. [Door opens] Honey? Your mother's here. [Whispers]: Tommy. Mom. [Gasps] [Sobbing] Son of a bitch. This isn't working. We're not gonna be able to attach the skull to the neck bone. It'll take six screws. The cervical vertebra has a fracture on the left side. There's nothing for the screws to hold onto. What about the front of the neck? No. It's got a hairline fracture there, too. The N20 is starting to fade. I don't know how much more of this he can take. What are we gonna do? I don't know. You're going to need to attach  the skull directly to the spine. What keeps it in place? A titanium loop. Use the wires to secure it to the base of the skull and remove a piece of his rib to fortify it. They've had success with the procedure at Barrow in Phoenix. I observed it at a seminar there last spring. It will work. It's our best option. [Monitor beeping steadily] Ready, Doctor? Sweat. [Monitor beeping steadily] Almost done. I've attached the loop to the spine and the wire to the skull. What's next? Very easy, Jordan. Go underneath that piece of rib to fortify the spine. Very careful. I got it. The graft needs to be placed on each side of the spinous process between C1 and C2. Okay. The grafts are in position. Let's secure them and close. I'm still glad I hit him. [Gasps] I'm a little claustrophobic. It's gonna be okay, Kara. Just take a nap. Okay? You need to be very still. We only have one shot at this. [Beeps] I'm afraid the test results from our earlier appointment were not encouraging. Your vision is definitely deteriorating. When was the last time you had corrective surgery? It's been a while. Not since med school. Oh. You're an M.D., too? No, I had to quit. You really can't perform surgery when you can't see that well. [Grunting] Hey. Hey. So how's your boy doing? Think he'll make it? Don't know. Have to wait for the swelling to go down first. All right. How you doing? Doing great. [Grunting] You know that new intern Krista? Yeah. Totally into me. I'm not gonna do anything about it, though. Don't worry. But... I mean, not that I wouldn't want to. She's pretty hot, right? I'd love to hit that. But... Gray area in the workplace. Kinda confuses, crosses the line and such. Drew. What? [Panting] Do you really want me to say it? I have no idea what you're talking about. No one cares that you're gay. I'm not gay. Okay. Okay. Sorry I brought it up. But... you don't have to pretend with me if... you are pretending. Why would you even think that? You've been here over a year. Nobody's ever met your girl. Nobody's seen you with a girl. You've turned down a ton of other women, fix-ups from the other nurses. Now there's this hot new intern... Okay, okay, stop. Do you think anyone else thinks this? No... no, nobody's said anything that I've heard, but maybe you should think about coming out. No way. No. Are you insane? The second I come out, I am the gay guy. How many gay guys were in your ranger unit? Exactly. I love the Army, Tee, and I will not risk losing that... for anything. Coming out is not an option. Wow. That is so gay. Matthew. Can you hear me? Matthew, move your hand if you can hear us. Can you do that? [Monitor beeping steadily] [Voice breaking]: Can you move your hand? Son? [Gasps] Oh. [Chuckles] [Weakly]: M-mom? [Crying]: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. It's gonna be okay. How amazing was that? Hey, how'd it go? It was unbelievable. Yeah? It worked. Kid got his feeling back. Thank God. [Pager beeps] Uh-oh. Yeah. Party's never over. I'll catch you guys later. So... I loved hearing from my new boss that I'm banging her ex. Mm. Thanks for the heads up on that one. Well, um... And... here I thought you were a virgin. Day shift staff, report for duty. All day shift staff, report for duty. Am I pregnant? No. It... it's... You have a condition called fetus in fetu. It's gonna sound freaky, but you had a twin. A twin? Yes. At your conception or... or early on, your twin didn't develop, but it stayed alive in a... In a very small tumor-sized form inside your body. So I'm not dying? No. [Exhales] You are not dying. In fact, the condition is so rare, that the med school will do your operation for free. That's great. Thank you so much. [Sighs] [Toilet flushes, stall door opens] [Exhales] [Turns on faucet] I don't know if you heard, but the boy pulled through. He's gonna be okay. That's good to hear. [Water splashing] So... We should have a conversation about what happened earlier. Yeah. [Punch lands] [Inhales deeply] Now we're even. [chuckles] [indistinct conversations] Hey, guys. Look, I know you're all off duty, and you just wanna relax after a very hard night, but, um... I just wanna say thank you. You really pulled together tonight. What about T.C.? Anything new? I don't know. I tried to help, but I just... Well, speak of the devil. So, Tee, what's the news? Well, I had a meeting with Ragosa. We worked it out. I ain't going anywhere. [Cheering] Woman : Thank you, Tee! Man : Go, Tee! Is that a new bruise on your face? I fell. Sure, you did. Jordan. [Clears throat] What's this? Uh, the paperwork for your drug study. You did all this for me after the night you've had? Yeah. Thank you. Ah. Welcome to the night shift, Jordan. [Clink]
