 I may not be able to make it. 
 Right. 
 Mom, I know it's your anniversary, but they may extend me till October. 
 Well, it's a war. I don't control it. 
 Right, I know. Mom... 
 Okay. 
 Right, listen, I got to go. 
 My commander just came in. We got casualties coming in. 
 Right. Love you. Yeah.

 I said, "What are you doing here?" 
 Working. 
 I know that. 
 I thought maybe you were going to take a week off, you know, get settled back in. 
 I've lost four months of my chief year. 
 I'm not taking any more time off. 
 Okay. Welcome back. 
 Incoming! 
 Who's that? 
 New intern, man. She's something else. 
 What do we got? 
 Wedding photo at Wedding Island gone wrong. 
 Bride tripped over her heels bringing the groom with her into the river. 
 I'm fine. [Grunts] Just help my wife, please. 
 Shannon. 
 On it. 
 Hey, sit down, sir. 
 It's easier if you don't fight us. 
 Jordan. 
 Drew, hey. 
 We'll catch up later, okay? 
 This is the bride. Possible C-spine injury. 
 My neck... really hurts. 
 I know it does, sweetie. I'm Dr. Alexander. I'm going to take care of you. 
 Can you tell me your name? 
 Kryztal. Where's my husband? 
 He's already inside getting treated, so let's get you in there, too. 
 All right, Drew, we got another one coming. 
 So let me know if you need any help. 
 I won't... need any help. 
 The rest of the wedding party. 
 I got a major emergency here. 
 Pete here has got a broken... heart from not getting to nail the hot bridesmaid. 
 [Laughter] 
 You think that's funny, you bunch of entitled ass wipes? 
 Huh? 
 Hey, people die here, all right? 
 They bleed on the ground you're standing on. 
 Drew, get the patient. The patient. 
 I'm with the doc. Bunch of frat boy a-holes. 
 This is Jorge, father of the bride. 
 He's got a head laceration and angulated wrist fracture. 
 Otherwise known as an owie. 
 I'm fine, doc. How's my little girl doing? 
 Let's get you cleaned up first, then we'll check on her. 
 ♪♪ 
 Will there be any celebrities? 
 Oh, of course, Mrs. Zia. You'll be here. 
 [Speaking native language] 
 Thanks for being here and blowing off your date. 
 Oh, I didn't blow it off. It wasn't a date. 
 Just going to meet her later at her place. 
 My point is thanks for being my buffer. 
 Just gotta show her a good time and then she leaves bright and early in the morning. 
 No problem. I love your mom. 
 You wouldn't say that if she came to stay with you for a month. 
 It's almost over. I get my life back. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh, this is so exciting. 
 I love the fancy casinos in Atlantic City. 
 Here, guys. Have a little fun on me. 
 Drink, gamble. 
 Maybe you'll find another hot chick here tonight. 
 Maybe... 
 Or maybe not. 
 This place is a dump, Christopher. 
 Why would you bring me here? 
 Just keep her busy. 
 I got you. 
 Come on, Mrs. Zia. Let's go have some fun. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, does this hurt? 
 No. 
 All right. How about here? 
 [Groans] A little. 
 All right. 
 K, you all right? 
 I'm fine. 
 Sorry, he wouldn't sit still. Wanted to be with his wife. 
 It's okay. We're going to take her to CT, clear her cervical spine. 
 Is there any news on the father? 
 Don't waste your breath on him. 
 Okay. 
 Just, he ruins everything. 
 This... this is all his fault. 
 It's a long story. 
 It's the same story. 
 He says he's sober and he's not. 
 My mother passed last year, and I just wanted someone from my family at my wedding. 
 I... I should've known better. 
 And he... he... 
 [Gasping] 
 Kryztal? Kryztal? 
 Kryztal? 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 What's happening?! Help her. 
 Colles' fracture. 
 Orthopod should get here in a few hours. 
 I'm fine. 
 All right, good. 
 Now let's take a look at this cut here. 
 Heard the nurses talking. 
 Army doc, huh? Where were you stationed? 
 This time, Bagram. 
 Was a medic in Iraq, back when it was the Wild West. 
 Those were the days. 
 You ever do patrol on Al-Rashid Street between Shuhada? 
 And the Anhar Bridges. 
 That crammed bazaar there, waiting any second for someone to hit an IED. 
 That was the hairiest thing I've ever been through in my life. 
 Where were you? 
 '03, I was chasing down Saddam. 
 Back in '04 and '05. 
 Then Kandahar, '07 and '09. 
 Sounds like you should've bought some property. 
 Yeah. Everybody needs a good mud hut, right? 
 Yeah. [Laughs] 
 You married? 
 To another soldier. 
 Smart man. My wife never did get it. 
 World goes on without you, you know? 
 Yeah, I got a friend back there that's missing her daughter's 13th birthday. 
 It's all she can think about. 
 I missed plenty of those. 
 Recitals, dances, soccer games. 
 Truth is, my daughter didn't want me at her wedding. 
 Well, that sounds a little harsh. 
 Yeah. 
 Irony is that every time I was out there, every single time, just the thought of my daughter was the only thing that kept me going. 
 Yeah. 
 Eric : Please, help her! 
 Does she have a history of fainting? 
 No, no way. 
 Is it possible she's pregnant? 
 I don't think so. I mean, she... she would've told me. 
 Any drugs, alcohol? 
 No. Yeah, actually. 
 She's taking anti-anxiety medicine for the wedding. 
 She's so high-strung, she was having bad dreams and nightmares. 
 Okay. Can you tell me the names of these medications? 
 I... I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. 
 All right. Let's get her to CT. 
 Can I go with her? 
 Once she's conscious, you can. 
 But we have to take her for some scans, all right? 
 We'll be back. 
 I love you, K! 
 ♪♪ 
 Dealer : 5. 
 No more underhand throws, old man. 
 And no more lip, dollface. 
 Unless you want to plant them on mine. 
 If you don't crap out, I'll do whatever you want with my eyes open. 
 Oh. 
 Who's this child? Is that your boyfriend? 
 Maybe he is. Maybe he isn't. 
 You just broke my heart. 
 Ah. Come on. 
 Easy 4. 
 She crushed me. What can I say? 
 If you give him some love, he'll get back on a roll. 
 Stop shooting blanks, old man. 
 I'll give you my number if you roll me something good. 
 Well, now I got incentive. 
 No, no, you don't, and no, you won't. 
 What's going on here? 
 I take one call from Janet, and you're playing craps? What happened to bingo? 
 Hey, your mother won't be kept down. I don't know. She's good. 
 [Speaks native language] Bingo is boring. 
 Why would you bring me to a casino to play bingo? 
 Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes. 
 There you go. 
 Dealer : Hard 10, yeah! 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 No one touch this table. 
 Hey. Hands off. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Pulse is pounding. 150s, at least. 
 Regular rhythm? 
 Yeah, probably SVT. 
 He's unstable. We need to cardiovert. 
 Grab the defibrillator off the wall, right there, now. 
 Go. 
 Let's go! Let's go! 
 Come on. Thank you. 
 Okay, ready? 
 Clear. 
 Clear. 
 No battery?! Come on! 
 I called the ambulance, but they're coming from the city, at least half an hour. 
 Okay. Toph, he doesn't have that long. 
 No, no, he doesn't. Okay. 
 Hey, Jocelyn, can you let me know when Kryztal gets out of CT? 
 Yes, Dr. Alexander. 
 Thank you. 
 So what's up with your Fireman Sam? 
 His buddy Jonah tells me you two went out again? 
 Your place or his? 
 Seriously, did we not just have this conversation about how when you're at work, I am your supervisor, not your friend? 
 Okay, I don't want to discuss my personal life here, and if I do happen to tell you something personal off hours, I don't want you to discuss it here. 
 I've been the topic of enough gossip to last me a lifetime. 
 Got it. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Nurse? Can I get a little help? 
 My, um, my leg hurts. 
 [Snickers] Yeah. 
 You know what? 
 I'm going to let you get that one. 
 Sure. After my next patient. 
 Jordan? 
 Oh, hey. 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Hi. 
 I did not get to greet you properly earlier. 
 Yeah, there was a lot going on. 
 Yeah. 
 What's going on with Kryztal? 
 Her dad wants to know. 
 He's been asking about her every two minutes. He wants to see her. 
 I think it would do him so good. 
 This whole wedding thing has gotten him a little upset. 
 Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea right now. 
 Why not? 
 Well, she made it pretty clear from her part that they're not that close, and she feels like he ruined her wedding. 
 Oh, did he push her in the river? 
 I... I'm just saying that I don't think it's a good idea and that we shouldn't get involved. 
 Why are you so upset by this? 
 'Cause I hate it when people don't respect what someone like him has been through. 
 No one's saying that. 
 Yeah, he told me he missed a lot of things, but he was at war defending his country, so I think that's a pretty good excuse for missing a few softball games. 
 I... I totally agree, but from what she said, it's more to do with him being an alcoholic. 
 Yeah, I wonder if five tours has anything to do with that. 
 Um... okay, look, Drew, you... you just got back. 
 You're a little raw. 
 That's not what this is about. 
 I'm speaking up for my patient. 
 And I'm speaking up for mine. 
 Okay, she's high-strung, she's fainting. 
 Please, let me fix my patient before we decide to solve any of the family issues. 
 For now, we'll just... we'll have to agree to disagree. 
 You'd think after everything you went through with T.C., you'd be on that guy's side. 
 I checked all four AEDs, all missing their batteries. 
 I found an AMP bag. 
 Toph, his pulse is getting weaker. 
 We need to get him back in sinus ASAP. 
 Uh, what about cold water immersion? 
 Stimulate his diving reflex. 
 Good idea. Got... 
 All right. 
 Let's make some room. 
 Okay, make some room, make some room, come on. 
 Give them some room. 
 The doctor says he needs room. 
 Here, hold this. 
 Ready? Let's go. 
 [Gasps] 
 There we go. 
 There we go. 
 [Coughing] 
 Thank you. 
 There we go. 
 Yeah, his pulse is back to normal. 
 Amazing. T.C. saved him! 
 That was amazing. 
 It was all Topher's idea, Mrs. Zia. I was just the busboy. 
 You're too modest, Dr. Callahan. 
 We'll get you training with Topher, man. Little cycling, we'll get you on schedule. 
 That's... 
 Look, no biggie. 
 That's great, man. Hey, listen, one other thing. 
 I know you guys, I know you like teasing Paul. 
 And I get that. But I would really appreciate it if you toned it down just a little bit. 
 I just don't want it affecting his work. 
 No problem. I'll spread the word. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. Hey, bro. 
 Hey. 
 How you doing? 
 Great. What was that... that with Scott? 
 Uh, He... he wants me to... he wants me to train him, get him back in shape. 
 You know, chicks love the abs. 
 Right, right. 
 So... so he wasn't saying anything about me? 
 And before you answer, I will remind you that I have the hearing of an elephant. 
 Okay, fine. 
 He asked us to stop messing with you, and I said we would. 
 He... he didn't need to do that. 
 Makes me look bad, like I can't take care of myself, you know? 
 Hey, tell him, not me. 
 T? T? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm telling you, she loves you, you love casinos. 
 Toph, Toph, if you leave now, she will never let you hear the end of it. 
 Yeah, that's true. 
 [Laughs] 
 She's getting up there, man. 
 Come on, you complain, but what if it's her last visit? 
 Hey, my mom, she's going to outlive me. 
 Okay. 
 You know, I said the same thing about my mom, and you know when I got to tell her what she meant to me? 
 Over a respirator on her coma bed. 
 Maybe she heard, maybe she didn't. 
 Time to go, guys. 
 All right, you go, I'll stay. 
 Worst case, get drunk, call an Uber. 
 I've had enough people in my life trying to fix things for me, you know, and I'm tired of it. 
 I get that. I do, but you see my point? 
 I need the E.R. and the surgical departments to work well together and if they don't respect you... 
 Well, they... they will. 
 Look, I'm... I'm not the rah-rah guy. 
 I'm the lead by example guy. 
 They will follow me. It just might take a bit longer. 
 You know, maybe... maybe it's not your way or T.C.'s, but, you know, I could do it my way. 
 Okay. All right. Let's see how that goes. 
 So what's up? 
 Just, um, something wrong right here. 
 It hurts, so you might need to examine it. 
 Okay. Well, let me take a look. 
 Drop your pants, let's see it. 
 See it? 
 Yes. It. Your pen1s. 
 That's clearly what you're hinting at, right? 
 I'm just letting you know that my leg... 
 Come on, you started this joke. 
 Let's... let's see it through. 
 Let's... let's see how big you are. 
 My guess is you're an inch-worm. 
 Big-mouth guys usually are. 
 Everything okay here? 
 Huh. Yeah, I think we're good here. 
 Right, guys? 
 You've all learned a valuable lesson about wasting a doctor's time, right? 
 And you, hipster dude, give me your phone. 
 I know you were taking a picture. Come on. 
 You're lucky I don't break this. 
 Oh. Nice. Crop shot. 
 Delete. 
 Holy. 
 This is one right before she tripped. 
 Look, push in and you can see her eyes already rolling back in her head. 
 Yeah, so she didn't trip, she fainted. 
 Nice find. 
 So what does that mean? 
 Well, I'm going to have radiology read your scan right away, so we can figure this out. 
 But for now, I'm going to have Dr. Rivera stay with you, okay? 
 Let's scoot you over. 
 I can't get over calling you Dr. Rivera. 
 You look like my age. 
 Well, I can't get over the fact that you're my age and you're married. 
 It just made sense, I guess. 
 You got anyone special? 
 You mean, someone I've swiped right on? 
 Nah. Marriage is the last thing on my mind. 
 Well, that may change when you meet the right person. 
 I don't have time for the right person. 
 I come from a small town, like a really small town. 
 They paid for my med school and they're sort of depending on me, so I don't have time for someone special in my schedule, until say, 2025. 
 [Laughs] 
 I know what you're saying. 
 You think I'm drunk, right? Huh? 
 I'm not good enough? 
 Nobody's saying that. 
 Everybody said it! 
 I heard them at the wedding. 
 Your labs came back clean. I can tell you didn't drink. 
 All right, I'll tell them that. 
 All right. It'll be fine. 
 Jorge? 
 You! 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 Not true, not true. 
 No, listen. 
 Get away from me! 
 Get back! 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 Drew : Okay. All right, all right. 
 Get away from me. 
 Okay. 
 Get away from me! 
 Everybody, back! 
 Stay in the rooms! What happened? 
 Kenny : No idea. He just went crazy. 
 Get away from me! 
 Please drop the scalpel. 
 Let us help you, okay? 
 Get them away! 
 Drop the scalpel. 
 [Crying] 
 No, no, no. 
 [Grunts] 
 Talk to us. What's going on? 
 You see them? Do you see them?! 
 It's okay. 
 Get them off of me! 
 Jorge, we will. 
 I got this. 
 No, no, no! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Bones cracking] 
 Get some restraints! 
 Okay, he's fully sedated. 
 Let's get him to Trauma 3. 
 
 
 
 What did he do now? 
 He started another fight? 
 No, he didn't start a fight, okay? 
 He wasn't himself. 
 What? 
 Your father's hurting right now, okay? 
 You should reach out to him. He needs you. 
 He needs me? 
 He wasn't there for me when I needed him. 
 And who are you? 
 Okay. All right. What the hell are you doing? 
 I was just explaining her father's situation. 
 No, you were lobbying for him and you need to back off. 
 I don't feel very well. 
 Jordan. 
 What's wrong? Kryztal. 
 She's out again. 
 She's in v-tach. We need a crash cart. 
 I can't believe you rushed a guy with a scalpel. 
 I don't know, man, I just... I just reacted. 
 Yeah, I mean, that's what I thought last year at the accident. 
 Almost cost me my career. 
 Yeah, but look at you now. 
 Gonna be a bad-ass surgeon just like your pops. 
 Hey, I'm... I'm proud of you, man. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Yeah, this part of Scott's request or something? 
 No, no, I'm being serious. 
 When you first got here, man, you were like... you were like a scared little mouse, man. 
 [Laughs] You'd sweat, your voice would crack. 
 Yeah, that's your compliment? 
 Yeah, that's my compliment. 
 Got it. 
 I'm saying how far you've come. 
 Thanks, man. Uh... 
 That really means a lot. You saying... 
 Come on, don't get all emotional on me now. 
 No, no. I'm... I'm not. 
 I'm just... with my hand surgery, and the rehab... 
 It's all I've dreamed of ever since I was 5. 
 Hmm. 
 You know, I guess... I guess you just don't know how much you really want something until you almost lose it, you know? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Yeah. 
 I figured I'd be finishing up my NFL career by now. 
 But here I am. 
 Yeah, but I mean you love being a nurse. 
 Yeah, I do. I do. 
 But it wasn't my dream since I was 5. 
 Come on. 
 Please, you got to help me. 
 Doc, you got to help me. 
 You called for a trauma consult? 
 Yeah, blunt head trauma with worsening mental state. 
 May have sustained a brain bleed or a concussion, so we're going to get him a CT. 
 Let's go. 
 I don't feel good. 
 I don't feel good. 
 You just got to relax, Jorge, okay? 
 We're going to do a CT... 
 No! Don't you touch me! 
 Don't you touch me! [Coughs] 
 Type and cross for 4. Page GI. Let's go. 
 Her EKG is totally normal. 
 It shouldn't be, but it is. 
 You needed a cardiac surgery consult? 
 Yeah. Where's Scott? 
 He's busy. Sent me. 
 Dr. Alexander? 
 Okay. We have a seemingly healthy young female. 
 She fainted twice, went into v-tach, but now her EKG looks normal. 
 I agree. 
 Any other symptoms? 
 Yeah, anxiety. Probably pre-existing. 
 I have a list of anti-anxiety medications that she's on. 
 Okay. 
 And her husband mentioned she's been having nightmares. 
 Nightmares? 
 Trouble sleeping. 
 You have an idea? 
 Yeah, I... I do. 
 Yeah. 
 So, Ma, you have everything you need for your trip tomorrow? 
 Is that all you're thinking about? 
 Getting rid of me? 
 [Laughs] No. 
 No. 
 Just... Lynn and the twins really loved having you here. 
 That's because kids respond to discipline, not that Janet would know. 
 Stop! Stop! 
 Why do you have to be so... so critical about my wife? 
 About my kids? About me? 
 I'm the one who found the save for the old man. 
 I'm the hero! 
 Stop yelling. 
 It makes your face turn red. 
 There you go again. 
 Why are you like that? 
 You're so content to just be. 
 You're my son. 
 You're supposed to be better. 
 Better? 
 I'm a doctor. 
 I'm... no, I'm the Chief of the E.R. at a major trauma center. 
 I was an Army ranger. 
 I have not one, but three beautiful, intelligent daughters and an incredible wife, who, I'm going to tell you, finds you as aggravating as I do. 
 How can you say that [Speaks native language] to your mother? I raised you. 
 You... You terrorized me. 
 And you're... you're still doing it. 
 Nothing is ever good enough for you. 
 I can't... I can't win. 
 I'm not going to... I'm not going to take it anymore. 
 I mean, seriously, what'd you ever do with your life? 
 Mom. Mom. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Hey. Thought you had the night off. 
 Yeah, so did I. 
 An elderly patient with hypotension, SVT, converted on scene. 
 Got to get him to the cath lab, stat. 
 Okay, I'll get somebody to... 
 Hey, I got this. 
 You ever known me to pass off a patient? 
 Nice to meet you, Sam. 
 See you around. 
 So when was the last time you had a drink? 
 I don't drink. 
 Yeah. Dr. Alister said that your blood alcohol test did come back negative, but I'm going to ask you again, when was the last time you had a drink? 
 Drew : You puked up blood, Jorge. You know why? 
 Because you got ruptured varicose veins in your esophagus. 
 They're called varices. 
 It's the result of drinking. A lot of drinking. 
 Your shaking, your paranoia, your delusions... these are all symptoms of Delirium Tremens, which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. 
 I'm sober. 
 Hey, we're trying to help you here. 
 Okay? Just tell us the truth. 
 I... I wanted to be clean for her wedding. 
 I thought I could do it, man. 
 The last drink I had was on the plane, I swear. 
 Okay. 
 All right, man. That's good. 
 Admitting it is a good start. 
 And you can't stop like that again, though. 
 You saw what happens. Next time, it could be worse. 
 My daughter... she saw me getting restrained, didn't she? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Could one of you ask if I could see her for a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 Of course. 
 Hello? 
 I'm a man, I'm a doctor, and I'm looking for my mother. 
 I'm coming in. 
 Mom, I... I'm really sorry. 
 I don't know why I said that stuff. 
 I wasn't always nothing, you know? 
 I know. I know. 
 You worked your ass off at those restaurants. 
 I should be more grateful. 
 I was an engineer. 
 What? 
 Yes. I went to school in Hong Kong before you were born to be an engineer. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yes. 
 We moved to the United States. 
 And it was hard. 
 The language. 
 And then your father died. 
 And I had to give it all up to work at that crappy Dragon Palace, just to keep you and your sister alive. 
 Do you think I liked that? 
 Who knows what I could've done. 
 Why didn't you tell me that before, Mom? 
 Because... it was my job to make sure you were given every opportunity to do great things... 
 ...the things that I couldn't do. 
 And you did them. 
 And I am proud of you. 
 Can... can I hug you, Mom? 
 I know it's... it's weird, and we don't really do that. 
 Kryztal, you have something called Brugada Syndrome. 
 It explains why you're fainting and why your heart almost stopped. 
 It was actually the nightmares that tipped me off. 
 It's a symptom. 
 It's an electrical problem in your heart that could cause sudden cardiac death if not treated. 
 So what do we do? Is there a cure? 
 Yes. We treat it with an implantable defibrillator. 
 You have to attach this to my heart. 
 Is there another way? 
 I'm afraid there isn't. 
 And if we don't do this, you could go into cardiac arrest at any time. 
 Also, I think you should know that there's a genetic component to Brugada Syndrome. 
 It's... it's inherited. 
 And your father has the condition, as well. 
 Kryztal, look, I know that you're hurting, and you're scared. 
 But your father is, too, and he would really like to see you. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, too bad. 
 On top of being a drunk and ruining my past, my dad's also ruined my future. 
 I never want to see him again. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, I wouldn't jump on that tuna sandwich. 
 It's been there since Bush was president. 
 Oh, that's gross. 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] So, I... I hear your night of fun and debauchery got cut short. 
 [Laughs]

 Nothing says debauchery like a casino full of 80-year-olds with air tanks and walkers.

 That's a big change of plans. 
 For better or worse, right? 
 Yeah. 
 See, that's where we were smart. 
 We spread our worst out over eight years. 
 Yeah, we did.

 Look, I don't care if you dated T.C. or Dr. Clemmens. 
 Believe it or not, I may have dated other women before I went out with you. 
 Hmm. 
 Hmm. 
 I'm just saying that some guys have a hard time working with other guys that have dated the woman that they may or may not be interested in. 
 Well, I'm not like those other guys. 
 That's good. 
 And I'm definitely interested in a woman they may have dated. 
 In fact, I'd love to make her a gourmet breakfast this morning. 
 Oh? A gourmet breakfast? 
 Hmm. How many times have you used that line? 
 Oh, this is the first time. 
 I swear. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [Both laugh] 
 So what do you say? 
 Truffle omelet at my place around 9:00? 
 Why don't you make it 8:45? 
 Dr. Alexander to recovery. 
 He was always the best at everything. 
 [Laughter] 
 You brought your mom. 
 You've been avoiding that all month. 
 Yeah, what the hell? Let her brag about her boy. 
 You know, I have to say, it all turned out pretty damn good. 
 We had a conversation. 
 I mean, I'm still glad she's leaving, but that conversation, it opened up a whole new side of our relationship. 
 By the way, how's... how's the old man? 
 Clive? He's all patched up. 
 He'll probably be back at the casino in a week. 
 [Laughs] 
 Cemetery... 3-6 months. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Yeah. Don't be. 
 He, uh, had an amazing life. 
 He gets to go out the way he wants. 
 That's all we can ask for, right? 
 Hey, the shift's about to end, guys. 
 Remember what we talked about... "ethey artypay orfay ewdray." 
 What'd she say? 
 I have no idea. 
 The welcome home party for Drew. Let's go. 
 Why... why didn't you just say that? 
 Jordan : Took us a little bit longer than expected, but your surgery went well, and you should be feeling like yourself in no time. 
 Eric : So the nightmare wedding saved your life. 
 See? I knew I was right marrying you. 
 And how was my dad's surgery? 
 The surgeons got into his heart and the years of alcohol had already destroyed it. 
 He's gone. 
 Jordan : I'm so sorry, Kryztal. 
 [Crying] 
 Dad, hey. 
 Yeah, it's me. 
 Yeah, no, I know. I just wanted to... 
 Right. 
 Dad, just... 
 Yeah, I just called, 'cause there's something I need to tell you. 
 Drew? 
 Drew? 
 Hey. 
 I called my dad. 
 Okay. How'd it go? 
 Oh, sweetie. It's okay. 
 Come here. 
 Surprise! 
 Surprise! 
 Aw. 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 I was... I was running late. 
 Where's Drew? 
 Who knows? 
 But I'm starving, so I'm not waiting. 
 But first, I... I'd like to make a toast to my mom. 
 Thank you for reminding me what it takes to be a great parent, dedication to your family, and putting them above all else. 
 To you, Mom. 
 Cheers. 
 Thank you. 
 Hear, hear. 
 Cheers. 
 Mama Toph. Speech. 
 Okay, well... 
 I've always known that Christopher was the best and brightest, but to hear from his colleagues... 
 He is. 
 He's amazing. 
 ...it just helps me know that I've made the right decision. 
 I'm so proud of my son [Speaks native language] 
 Don't. 
 ...that I'm coming to live with him permanently. 
 Wow. 
 Congratulations. 
 Yeah. 
 Good to have family around. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Yeah. 
 She planned it. 
 Yeah. 
 She did it in front of everyone, 'cause she knew I couldn't refuse. 
 She used all of us as a buffer. 
 She played me, she played me. 
 Yeah.

 So thank you so much.
