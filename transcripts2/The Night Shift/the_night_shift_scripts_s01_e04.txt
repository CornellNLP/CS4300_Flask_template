 Listen up, Alamo people, everybody into the waiting room. 
 If you are not sick, then please go home. 
 The night shift hasn't even started yet, and you're giving everybody a headache. 
 Woman over P.A. : Night shift, report to duty in one minute. 
 How long does this go on? 
 All night. 
 They just keep trickling in. 
 Every year these Alamo reenactors drink too much homemade beer. 
 And eat too much rabbit stew. 
 [Retches, coughs] 
 Ohh! 
 Mop-up on aisle 3. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Look, if you can't get here, you can't get here. 
 No, it's fine. It's just... [sighs] 
 I was hoping that since it's my birthday tomorrow, but... no, I understand, really. 
 [Siren approaching] 
 Yeah. 
 We'll celebrate next week. Scott, I gotta go. 
 [Man screams] 
 Male, 30s. Single G.S.W. to proximal thigh. 
 B.P.'s stable. We found him at the Alamo. 
 Where am I? What's happening?! 
 You've been shot, okay? But we're gonna take care of you. 
 [Grunting and exhaling] 
 Hey, can you tell me your name? 
 I don't know. I don't know! 
 No I.D. Guy's on another planet. 
 We could barely get him in the ambulance. 
 There's another problem. He's a Christian scientist. 
 It says not to treat him. 
 We didn't see it until we were en route. 
 We can't treat him, right? 
 We need consent or we'll get sued. 
 [Grunting] 
 Don't worry about it. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 This guy looks like he was shot with a cannon. 
 [Grunts] 
 Musket. Uh, I bought it online. 
 Hey! Hey! Put that thing down! 
 Hey, I... I didn't know it was loaded, I swear. 
 Look, the dude lost it on me. 
 He attacked me and grabbed it like we were in a real fight, and... and it went off. 
 You cannot be back here. 
 Okay, but can someone check on my arm? 
 [Grunts] 
 Okay, wait, where are you taking me? 
 What do we got? 
 No! No! 
 Musket wound. 1830s Alamo special. 
 Stop it! Stop it! 
 And one very agitated patient. 
 ... three! 
 Don't touch me! 
 [Screaming] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down! 
 [Screams] Aah! 
 Calm down! We're trying to help you! Calm down! 
 Stop it! I don't... no! 
 We're trying to help! 
 Get me 2 of ativan I.M. and somebody page Dr. De La Cruz! 
 We're trying to help you. 
 Get... get off me! 
 [Groans loudly] 
 Jordan ready with the ativan. 
 Got it. 
 You're trying to kill me! 
 [Groaning] 
 Somebody grab the hard restraints, yeah? 
 [Groaning fades, stops] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Laughs] 
 Hell of a night for Drew to be off on maneuvers. 
 [Laughter] We could use the muscle. [Laughs] 
 Yeah. Be good to have him back tomorrow. 
 I gotta be honest. 
 I got no love for night infiltration exercise. 
 [Chuckles] This is a cakewalk, Javy. 
 Army reserves is nothing compared to the 61 days of hell in training school for Rangers. 
 You still thinking of signing up, Drew? 
 I don't know. I've got a buddy at the hospital I work with who's ex-Ranger. 
 He says he can put in a good word for me, but right now I'm more focused on medicine. 
 Bet you're more focused on the nurses. 
 No lack of hotties in the E.R. 
 So, Javy, what's the deal, huh? 
 15k march at the end too tough on the old bones? 
 Oh, yeah, dude, that might have something to do with sitting on your lazy ass in a patrol car all day. 
 [Laughter] 
 Hey, my wife loves my lazy ass, so it's all good. 
 You know why? 
 'Cause that just matches her fat ass. 
 Hey, that's the mother of my children. 
 I like 'em curvy. 
 Don't you, Drew? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 No, me? Love me the motorboat. 
 Just... [Babbles] right in there. 
 [Laughter] Let's get moving. 
 We only have eight hours to the rendezvous point. 
 And then Drew can get back to those nurses of his. 
 [Rock music playing] 
 Let's try moving a little faster so we can get you a robe. 
 Do you have the paperwork on those involuntary hold patients from last week? 
 Yeah, it's in a folder on my desk. 
 [Intercom beeps] 
 [Woman on P.A. speaking indistinctly] 
 [Papers thud] 
 [Folders thud] 
 [Groans softly] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Pills rattle] 
 Woman on P.A. : Paging Mr. Ragosa to the nurses' station. 
 Mr. Ragosa, please report to the nurses' station. Let's see what's going on with this big guy now that he's out. There must be 20 fragments in here. Distal blood flow is good. We need to get every one of those out. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Blood pressure and pulse ox are dropping. Yeah, yeah. [Gasps sharply] [Beeping continues] Massive right heart strain. Piece of the bullet must have embolized. Uh, B.P.'s down to 40. We need to get that bullet out of the lung now! Jordan? I just talked to one of the paramedics, and he said this guy came in with a "do not treat" bracelet on his wrist, and that you ignored it. Lido with epi 1%. Open up a chest tray. If you did do that, you have opened yourself and this hospital up to a major lawsuit, so please, please tell me you didn't do that. The guy's lying. There's no bracelet. Jordan? [Rapid beeping continues] He had one. I cut it off. Oh... Jordan. And even she didn't, I would have. He was dying. He needed to be treated. I agree with you. But we get him declared incompetent first, contact legal. We don't just cut things off. Sorry, but I'm gonna need you to step back and let T.C. finish this patient. You are officially suspended. [Rock music playing] You know, I wish one of you fools was a hot chick. A little eye candy would be nice right about now. What do you mean, man? This is the best-looking combat support team in Texas! That's right. Yeah, right. Hey, did you guys hear about that gay dude in "C" company? Heard a rumor. Who cares? I do. I thought your generation was supposed to be more open-minded. All right, look. I'm getting shot at by some sniper in Syria or Iraq or wherever, all right? I don't need the guy who's supposed to be covering my ass checking it out instead. Yes, and I'm sure that's what he's thinking. "I could die out here right now, but, man! Look at that scrawny, pimply ass on Charlie!" Oh, yeah! Just my opinion, man. And now I'm-a go shoot something! [Speaks indistinctly] Hey! Charlie, come on! [Gunfire] You don't have to be straight to be in the army. You just have to shoot straight! That's all I care about, man! Javy! Watch out! Oh! [Moos] [Loud crash] So she saves a life and she gets canned? Nobody is firing her. [Inhales deeply] God, why is it so hot in here? [Breathing heavily] Like I said, nobody is firing her. She's on administrative duty. I'm taking this precaution to protect her from any further action. We'll get him declared incompetent and go from there. So, what, I just sit around all night? You... need to stay away from this patient, and you need to talk to legal and hope to hell Landry finds him incompetent. After that, whatever you do with any other patients, I don't want to know about it. Now if you'll excuse me, I really need a glass of water. [Breathing heavily] It'll be okay. You don't know that. I don't have your friends in high places. Sorry I put you guys in this position. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Door opens and closes] Hey, what's going on? I've never seen Jordan act like that before. It's a long story. Let's get the rest of this shrapnel. [Sighs] [Panting] Javy... Yeah. I'm coming... Aah! My shoulder! I can barely pull him out. Yeah, just sack up, do what you can, okay? Aah! Aah! [Screaming] Ohh! [Grunting] [Panting] Oh, God. Here. Okay. I'm gonna go check on Javy. [Groaning] What do we got? What do we got? Oh! My shoulder. [Grunting] [Speaks indistinctly] Oh! That really hurts! You got a separation of an A.C. joint. Drew! Drew, I need you! I'm coming. I'm gonna be right there, Mikey. [Shuddering] Come on, Drew. Come on. Drew! I'm going as fast as I can. My ankle's screwed up! [Grunting] I'm in pain. Hang in there, Mikey, hang in there. You're good. Now I need to go to Mikey. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Where's Charlie? Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Javy, I know you're hurting. You gotta go find Charlie. Okay. Go. Okay, Mikey, I'm here, I'm here! Charlie! [Phone ringing] [Indistinct conversations] Hey, is that crazy dude gonna die? Hey... just hold still, sir. [Sighs] And I... I don't know. I can't go to jail. I'd never make it there. I saw every episode of "Oz." [Scoffs] They eat guys like me alive. Yeah, they would. But I think you're safe. That guy is... it's pretty clear he's unstable. Whoa. Uh, General Santa Anna, right? Sweet costume. It's... Any news on the guy I shot? Yeah, they... they've got him sedated in trauma 1. The waiting room is filling up again with reenactors, and we hooked up some more drunks to the saline packs. And, uh, sent three food poisoning guys home, too. Ah. That rabbit stew's nasty. [Chuckles] Uh, that's why I fight on the Mexican side. We have a food truck. All right, you guys only have a couple dozen more patients to go. I'll join you as soon as I'm finished, okay? And I'll let you watch me do one of the E.J.s. I've been waiting for two hours to see a doctor. I... I know, ma'am. Look, I am so sorry. The Alamo reenactors have us slammed with patients. My stomach's killing me. Uh... I'll get you a doctor as soon as I can. [Sighs] Hey. Hey. You ordered a G.I. panel on exam 2, but haven't seen the patient yet. She's pissed. Yeah, I... I know. I read the chart. Uh, it sounds like stomach flu or something. Um... Oh, but Topher's gonna do an external jugular, and I really wanna watch. I've never seen one, so... But her results are already back. Great. I will see her after the E.J. Um, just start some fluids, okay? Thanks. Dispatch? Yeah, yeah, this is Dr. Callahan. Um, there was a Paramedic Gonzalez... he came in with a G.S.W. from the Alamo at 7:30 tonight. Um, can you tell him to come by the E.R.? I have some info that he may need. Drew! [Gasping] Is it... is it broken? And dislocated. Okay, I'm gonna try and get your boot off, okay? Aah! Aah! Okay... Okay, Mikey, I just gotta get in there, okay? I got you... that's right. Let me get my finger... Aah! Mikey, I can't feel a pulse. Okay? Means the dislocation's cutting off the blood flow to your foot, so I've gotta reduce the fracture. What the hell does that mean? Means it's gonna hurt like a son of a bitch. [Gasping] Okay, deep breath. Okay. Okay? Count of three. You with me? One, two... [Cracks] Aah! [Groans] [Gasping] Damn you, Drew! Aah! It's better than dying. All right? Where is Javy? There's blood dripping down the back of your neck. What? That sucks. Okay. Um... You're about to get even, Mikey. [Groans] It's a skin stapler. All right? It's self-explanatory. [Panting] Push the edges of the wound together. [Panting] Apply pressure. Squeeze the trigger. [Stapler clicks] [Groans] [Stapler clicks] [Both groan] [Stapler clicks] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [Stapler clicks] Ow! Drew! Drew! I found Charlie. He's in really bad shape. [Panting] We're gonna get Charlie. Be right back. You hold on, okay? You were at the Alamo. You were shot. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] He's incompetent, right? He's still too out of it from the anesthesia for me to make a diagnosis. Mm-hmm. I just thought I'd check since Jordan had paged me three times. Mm-hmm. What's going on? He's a Christian scientist. [Sighs] He came in with a "Do not treat" bracelet. Jordan cut it off. What? Yeah. So you declaring him incompetent... go a long way towards getting her off the hook. Well, first of all, I can't believe she did that. But I'm not just gonna label him without talking. He was screaming, he was yelling... That could be for any number of a hundred things. Look, I like Jordan, but I'm not gonna risk my license or a malpractice suit by giving an unwarranted diagnosis, especially when she does something that stupid. I would have done the same thing. What do you want me to say here, T.C.? I don't agree with you on this, so let's just not talk about it. He wakes up, I'll make the diagnosis. But don't tell me how to do my job. You're right. I'm sorry. [Tone beeps] [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Speaks inaudibly] [Cell phone alert chimes] [Intercom beeps] Dr. Alexander, report to the legal department. Dr. Alexander, report to the legal department. Everyone's gonna be okay. That doesn't look good. He needs an O.R. Call the T.O.C. and get a medevac! The antenna tore off when we rolled. Radio's shot. And there's no cell signal out here. We're on our own, Drew. I'll try to tamponade the bleeding, but this packing's just a temporary fix. Get the litter. We got to get up to the extraction point. It's at least 5 miles. Well, then we better get going. Hang in there, buddy. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Chuckles] Mollie says he's been standing there for the past five minutes. I figure he's trying to find a way to save money on electricity. Hey. Michael? [Inhales deeply] I took a couple of pills from your aspirin bottle, but I'm pretty sure they weren't aspirin. You wanna tell me what it was? From the bottle on my desk? Yes. They were, um... M.D.M.A. M.D.M.A.? As in ecstasy? Why do you have... I'm so sorry. I swear there is a legitimate explanation. [Whispers] What's happening to me? Well, um, your... your senses are heightening, and you will be more open and physical with people... and objects. [Whispers] No. No, no, no, no, no. This is not happening. [Breathing heavily] I can fight this. You don't really have control over it. [Gasps] Maybe you should just sit in your office until it passes. [Gasps] I am so angry with you right now. You women are really messing up my night. We're gonna deal with this later. Okay. Drink a lot of water. [Whispers] Water. Uh, Ragosa's on ecstasy? Shh! No, how... I... wait. So I was involved in an experimental study... [Lowered voice] on the effects of M.D.M.A. on soldiers with P.T.S.D., and the drug, it just... it releases serotonin and oxytocin so the soldiers can relive their trauma without feeling pain. Okay. [Normal voice] Please keep this on the D.L. [Laughs] Gotcha. Got it. Gotcha. Gotcha. Drew : Mikey's gonna be fine back there. And I know your shoulder's killing you, Javy, but you gotta keep up with me. Charlie is in bad shape. I'm trying, man. You think he's gonna make it? I don't know. He can't die, man. He's just a kid. I've seen a lot of kids die. Age has got nothing to do with it. I gotta tell you, Drew... I want to quit this whole army thing. I just joined the reserves to get some extra cash for my wife and kids. I don't want to get killed. Aren't you afraid of getting killed? No one wants to die, Javy, but if I think about that out there, I'm not gonna be able to do my job as a medic. [Grunts] [Helicopter blades whirring] [Grunting] Why are we stopping? [Helicopter approaching, gunfire] Javy, we're on the range. The shooting range! Go! Go, go, go! Move, move, move! [Men grunting] [Gunfire continues] Get down! [Grunts] Let's get the hell outta here! Mollie, I need to see if anyone filled out a missing person report on John Doe. Can you call S.A.P.D.? I'm on it. Maybe we shouldn't call S.A.P.D. We always do that with John Does. We have no idea what his medical or psychiatric history is. His family could be looking for him. His family, more likely than not, are the ones that would let him die. You don't know that. They're Christian scientists, which means they are gonna want to stop any treatment that you or I want to do, and that man will needlessly suffer. Just let me do my job, okay? Don't get all pissy at me because you screwed up and cut off his bracelet. He was dying. Yeah, that's what he wanted. That's why he wore the bracelet. That's his choice. To die when he can easily be saved? You're backing that? I am backing personal freedom. I'm backing nobody telling anybody what they can do with their body. Would I ever do that? No, but I believe in his right to believe in it. He may not know what he believes. You didn't know that when you cut it off. You saw his religion, and you made a choice. Maybe that guy is incompetent, but what if he wasn't? What if he was just a lawyer who had a different belief than yours? Would you still do it? Every single time they're brought in here. Well, then I guess we just see things differently. On a lot of things. What does that mean? Forget it. No, say it. Okay. It means that I know you're sleeping with T.C. And that's fine. It's not my business. But I can't believe after some of the conversations that you and I have had about me, him, and our past, that you never once thought that maybe you should mention it. [Distant crash, clattering] I need a doctor in here. [Weakly] My chest! I can't breathe. Okay. Heart rate's in the 30s. All right. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna listen to your heart. There are S.T. elevations. This woman's having a heart attack. Why hasn't she been seen? I thought she had. Page cardiology. Give me 325 milligrams of aspirin and grab the pacer pads. We need a formal E.K.G. now. She already had one. Well, who ordered it? What happened? Is this your patient? Uh, yeah. She had the stomach flu. And did you order an E.K.G. on her? I... I did as part of a G.I. work-up. Did you look at it? You have an African-American woman in her late 40s with diabetes complaining about stomach pain, and you didn't look at her E.K.G.? She should have been in the cath lab two hours ago. Look... she wasn't complaining o... of chest pain. It doesn't matter. If you order a test, you're responsible for the results,  and if that test is an E.K.G., you look at it immediately. [Monitor beeping steadily] Inferior M.I. Paul, you're an E.R. doctor. Your job is to think of things that would kill your patient first and label it as benign later. It isn't all about the flashy procedures. I'm sorry. Don't apologize to me. Learn. Do better. [Lowered voice] I told you to look at the tests, man. I want to give you the heads-up. Mm-hmm. Jordan knows about us. How? I don't know. We were arguing about John Doe. Big deal. We see it differently. And then it just... came out. Right. You want me to talk to her? No, I can fight my own battles. Aside from tonight, she has every right to be pissed at me. We were becoming friends. You're her ex. I should have told her. T.C., Paramedic Gonzalez is here to see you. Is John Doe ready? Yeah, he's coherent now. Hey, buddy. Thanks for coming by. My union rep said I shouldn't talk to you. Nah, your union rep's a douche. Is he on the front lines like you and me? No. Let's talk about what you really saw. I have to determine your competency, so I need you to focus and think really hard. What's your name? I don't know. I... I don't know who I am. Please help me. Please. That's right, I'm gonna help you. I'm going to show you some pictures. It's a test to help you remember. Let me know if anything seems familiar. It doesn't matter if it's the smallest thing. [Tone beeps in distance] [Labored breathing] Anything? No. Wait, wait. Go back. What does this make you think of? A diner. Good. You like diners? Yeah, I... I think I ate there, at a diner. Anything else? Chris... Christine. You remember someone named Christine? Yeah, Christine. Uh... but I... I don't remember what she looks like or who she is. I don't remember anything else. Oh... why is this happening to me? Who am I? I know it's scary, but we're gonna figure this out, and we'll find whoever's looking for you, I promise. [Exhales] 
 
 [Helicopter blades whirring faintly] All right. All clear. Let's move. Charlie's bleeding again. Damn it. What's happening? Part of the bowel has ruptured. I gotta suture it up later. This is why you're not going for Ranger, right? It's not worth it. We can be killed, and for what? Protecting some damn dictator? This stupid kid he's an idiot. He wouldn't be hurt so bad if he wasn't firing that stupid gun. Javy, he can hear you. Shut up. Now is not the time. Is Christine an Alamo reenactor like you? [Lowered voice] Doctor. S.A.P.D. doesn't have a missing person fitting John Doe's description. And I left messages at the Christian science church. [Lowered voice] Good. He just mentioned a diner and a girl named Christine. Either he took her on a date there once, or she works there. I'm hoping it's the latter. Can you... Call all the 24-hour diners in the area? I'll help. How many can there be? [Monitor beeping rapidly] Get T.C. T.C.! What happened? He was fine, then all of a sudden his vitals started going crazy. Maybe it's another embolus to the lung. No, I got rid of all the shrapnel. Must be something else. Push 150 milligrams amiodarone. On it. [Monitor beeping rapidly] No, wait. It's too late. Look at his blood pressure. [Beeping continues] Clear. [Paddles thunk] [Gasps] [Monitor beeping steadily] Back in a sinus rhythm. [Exhales] Pressure's up to 105. What the hell was that? I have no idea. [Kenny exhales] She's probably not going to wake up for another hour or so, Doctor. That's all right. I'll just sit with her until she does. [Monitor beeping steadily] Okay, so we need a stat chest C.T. And add on a tox panel. Thank you. Right away. That was close. So... What did you learn before he started to code? Looks like a mania-induced fugue state. Based on the retrograde amnesia, his aggressive behavior towards the reenactors... So this case is even more complicated. For now. It's a tricky condition. It could be caused by any number of things. Could last for hours or even months. We need to find out who he is. And I know that doesn't help Jordan. If he does have family that could sue... No, trust me, Jordan cares more about this guy living than any trouble she's in. But if they try to can her for it, I'll quit. That will get the board's attention. You'd really quit? That's very loyal. I'm gonna go check on the labs, see if there's anything I missed. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Spanish music playing] Yo, yo, what up, Tony? Hey, Dr. Topher. We got a great special tonight. Check it out. I see what you did there. You want my advice on your vasectomy? Yeah, I was just too shy to ask. Just a burger and fries, Tony. Let's go. Hey, Topher. Hey! Hey. Is your crappy night still going crappy? Man, you sure do know what to say to a girl to cheer her up, you know that? Ah, it's a gift. Yeah. Now, you know, uh, when the lawyers ask you if you'd do it again, the answer is "no," right? Yeah. I probably could have handled that better. Dr. Topher. Hey, can I get a coffee? Yeah, you got it. [Coffee pouring] I thought you might want to know, I declared John Doe incompetent. Wasn't rocket science. I needed to examine him, Jordan. [Mutters indistinctly] You wouldn't rubber-stamp any diagnosis I gave without checking. Look, I know I didn't handle this whole thing with T.C. very well. I should have said something to you. Yeah, you probably should have, considering that you had at least 72 chances to tell me that you were sleeping with my ex. You could have told me before I set you up on that blind date, which, in retrospect, is totally bizarre that you went. I wanted to get to know you better. That's why I went. Anyway, T.C. and I aren't that serious. Landry, what you and T.C. do or don't do is really not my concern. Now you're being dishonest. Excuse me? Come on, you work in a hospital with your ex-boyfriend. You actively pursued to manage his shift, all while your current boyfriend lives in Dallas. Yeah. That's where Scott works. Jordan, this is psych 101. You have no interest in really committing to Scott, because you still have feelings for ex-boyfriend T.C. T.C. isn't just an ex-boyfriend, okay? He isn't some guy that I dated for a little while and it just didn't work out. I understand. You have history. You have no idea what we have. T.C. was a wreck when he came home. He wasn't the man that you see today. I left my job, my friends, everything so that I could come here and help him out. I... stood by him through hell. So, yeah, we have a history, and, yes, I have feelings for him. ♪ [Cell phone rings] Fries? [Ring] Mollie, you found John Doe's Christine? Whoo! Topher! This is my jam! This is my jam! [Charlie gasping] Okay. [Continues gasping] Doc? I'm here, Charlie. I... can't... g... go anymore. Hurts too much. Put me down. Okay. Javy, put him down. Count of three. All right. One... two... three. [Men grunt] Let me take a look. [Gasps] Hey, you're looking great, man. I'm telling you, you look spectacular. I'm serious. I give up. I need you to keep fighting. You understand me? Keep fighting. You can do it, Charlie. [Coughing] Okay. [Sighs] Up on the count of three. One, two, three. [Men grunt] Uhh! Aah! You got it? You all right there, Charlie? Doing okay? I'm all right. Hold on. Ahh. Here. Yeah. [Grunts] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Push. [Coughing] We don't get him there in the next hour, he's not gonna make it. You gotta keep him talking, distract him. Copy that. Okay. [Exhales] Okay. Up on three. One, two, three! Hey. You know I'm not supposed to be treating him. Yeah, well, I need your brain, all right? His vitals went wonky. I can't figure it out. Chest C.T. came back with nothing, all right? Now he's spiking a fever and he isn't responding to antibiotics. I think the leg must be getting septic. Okay. But he's already on two antibiotics. I've added a third, I've resent his blood cultures, and... [monitor beeping rapidly] His fever's climbing. Cooling measures now. And now he's twitching. What the hell's going on? Okay, okay, um... It could be meningitis, or... tetanus from the bullet. Right? Maybe. Dystonic reaction? Yes. Just got off the phone with a woman who knows him. And she said he was fine three weeks ago, so I think his fugue state has to be connected to his worsening condition. In what way? I'm not sure. Landry, this is a medical issue. When you have something that can really help us, let us know. Thanks. Okay. Jordan. Jordan! Push 150 milligrams amiodarone. Aggies over U.T.? What are you, crazy? What else you got, Javy? Hey, Charlie, if you could snap your fingers and be anywhere, where would you be, buddy? [Weakly] I don't know. Yeah, you do, man. Come on. Where you wanna go? I'm thinking Vegas with all the chickies, a little bit of booze, huh? In... in the Gulf, catching marlins. Love it. How about you, Javy? Uh, Miami Beach, baby. [Laughs] Drinking margaritas with my wife by the pool, have my parents take the kids for the week. That'd be a vacation. How about you? Oh, man, I love the old cities. You got Paris, Rome... just the history of 'em, learning about 'em. Yeah, me and Rick, we usually end up in Hawaii, though. My... my brother Rick. I vacation a lot with my brother. We're close. [Exhales] Hawaii's cool. Yeah. [Charlie grunting] Hang on, Charlie. Hang on. Woman over P.A. : Mr. Ragosa, please report to Records. Mr. Ragosa, please report to Records. This positivity! Oh, man, this is where it's at. I just feel really, really, really good! Kenny told me that Ragosa accidentally took some E, and he's just been rolling all night. [Ragosa shouting indistinctly] You should... you should really go back to work. Ragosa : Ahh! Yeah. Right. Ragosa : Surgeon? Huh? I really see you! I see you! Remember the Alamo! [Laughing] John Doe's lumbar puncture and tetanus titer are negative. But his fever keeps going up. And he keeps spasming. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Sighs] What are we missing? Been asking myself for hours. Maybe you shouldn't have jumped all over Landry. Is now really the time to talk about that? I'm talking about saving John Doe. Look, we have no idea what's wrong with him. She was just trying to help. By throwing out theories? Well, that is what we are doing. [Sighs] Look, I know that it's been a rough night for you. If you want to talk... I know you're with Scott. I know. But you can come to me anytime. You know that, right? I'm fine. [Sighs] But you're right. It's just been a really tough night. I'm just gonna recheck his labs. How many times did you stick this guy? Five... and a half. His vein keeps moving. I mean, it's... it's literally like trying to stick Jabba the Hut. Maybe after two tries, you come find me next time. Especially after the night you've had, Paul. Let's hope he doesn't have a heart attack, too. Hello, sir. I'm Dr. Zia. Let's see if I can help you. Those kids don't know what they're doing. Well, your veins do present a challenge. Look over to the left and hold your breath, please. Are you the doctor getting his huevos snipped? I... I didn't say anything, I swear. He didn't. He blushes whenever anyone mentions balls. Never get a vasectomy. [Chuckles] I got snipped. Damn doctor said it would only hurt for a couple of days. Liar! Felt like somebody put a blowtorch on my man meat. I could barely walk. [Clenched teeth] And things were never the same again in the bedroom, you know what I mean? Ah. That could have been caused by any number of conditions. Nope. I used to wake up every morning with a flagpole, until I got the big "V." Now I'm taking E.D. pills by the truckload just to get a little movement. Ow! Sorry. Over here! We need some help! There was an accident! He needs a medevac! Get the chopper here now! Down. Yeah. [Grunts] [Engines revving] Hey, Charlie, we made it! Okay? You're gonna be in the hospital in no time. We'll come by and check on you. [Panting] Thanks, doc. You... you should go for Rangers, man. They'd be lucky to have a guy like you. [Grunts] All right, get him out of here. I spoke to operations about Mike. They already got him. [Chuckles] He had it easy. [Chuckles] Yeah. No doubt. Hey, get that shoulder looked at. You might need surgery. Sure. You know... Charlie can be an idiot. I bet he's around gay guys all the time and doesn't even know it. He's right about one thing, though. You'd make one hell of a Ranger. A pleasure serving with you, Lieutenant. Dr. Alexander. This is Christine. Hi. She was John Doe's... George's girlfriend. He has bipolar disorder. Yeah, that's actually why we broke up. Um... it just got really hard to deal with. I'm sorry. You said bipolar. Christine, was he on any kind of medication? Well, he was, but he hated the side effects of it. So that's why he came to our church... to try a more holistic approach. Okay, do you remember what kind it was? It was... Lithium. Yeah. When did he go off it? Maybe, like... a month ago. I think I know what's going on with George. Um, excuse me. Get the pharmacy. Now. Come on. [Monitor beeping] He's having a seizure. A gram of dilantin, now. He's going into v-tach again. Pulse ox is dropping. Hand me the ambu bag. Bolus 25 migs of dantrolene and start him on a versed drip. Hang a bag of D5 half with 3 amps bicarb. He's bipolar. He stopped taking lithium abruptly two weeks ago, and when you don't slowly wean yourself off of mood stabilizers... Causes neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Nice catch. It wasn't all me. So his fugue state was connected to his condition. Huh. I guess you did need a psychiatrist after all. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Sighs] I missed something juicy, didn't I? [Sighs] Christine, look, I know that you don't believe in medical treatment, but... Actually, I do believe in it. I go to doctors if I need them. I just prefer to try prayer first. Thanks for saving George. Landry, hey. Hold on a second. [Sighs] I'm sorry for jumping on you earlier. It was uncalled-for. You helped save George, and... I couldn't have done it without you. Anything else? Look, uh... [sighs] this case really pushed my buttons. When I was 15, my father contracted severe pneumonia. He needed antibiotics and eventually surgery. And it was very treatable. But he wouldn't do it. He just wanted to pray. And... my mother agreed. So... I watched him die. I had no idea. And then you decided to be a doctor. [Chuckles softly] Something like that. I am really, truly sorry for being such a bitch to you. And this isn't an excuse for my behavior. It's just an explanation. Well, it's a damn good one. And you should've just told me that. It would have helped. But look... [Sighs] I'm sorry, too... about everything. I don't know that... that we'll ever be best friends, but... I'd like to try to at least be work friends. Okay. I can live with that. Okay. All right. Hello, handsome. Mm. How was drill? Uneventful. Have you seen T.C.? I want to talk to him about that Ranger recommendation. Oh. I thought you were leaning on not going for Ranger. I was. I just think I might need them as much as they probably need me. [Chuckles] Hold up. Oh! Uneventful, huh? Mm-hmm. Hey, I want to hear every detail, Lieutenant Badass. Whoa! That's nasty. Yeah, I figured I'd let Krista and Paul stitch it up, get some practice in, nice and neat. Yes. Speaking of, uh, where is he? Paul? He's... probably sulking. He got spanked by Jordan tonight. That's how you know-it-alls learn. [Chuckles] [Chuckles] Come on. There's, uh, something we have to do. [Gasps] Yes! [Laughs] Ooh. Hey, Jordan. Better hurry up. Why? Huh, it might involve cake, is all I'm saying. You guys! I can't believe you... [Gasps] Soccer balls? Yeah, they're for Topher. Symbolic of his operation. Yum. Hey, he's coming, he's coming. Surprise! Surprise! [Cheers and applause] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh! It's like a nightmare come true. [Laughter] All right. Uh, thank you, I think. Uh, those are actual size, right? [Laughter] Topher, urology's ready for you. All right. [Inhales and shivers] You sure you wanna do this, buddy? Yeah, yeah, I am. Yeah? [Chuckles] All right. Dead man walking! Right. That's funny. [Speaks indistinctly] [Bagpipes playing "Amazing Grace"] [Chuckles] Right. ♪ [Laughs nervously] That's... that's nice. [Laughter] Thank you. Everybody's here... and nobody's with the patients. Fantastic. Back to work, everyone. ♪ [Clears throat] [Exhales] [Bell dings] Jordan. [Exhales] I just got a call from legal. They wanted me to tell you the paramedic has changed his story. He says he can't swear that it was a "do not treat" bracelet, and it could have been a fuelband or something like that. Why would he do that? I could make a guess. [Cell phone alert chimes] [Chimes] [Chimes] How are you feeling? [Chuckles] Actually, I'm fine. It was enlightening. It can be. You know, I never told anybody this, but... I have some degenerative issues with my left eye. You do know how to keep a secret. How bad is it? Partial blindness, and now the headaches are getting worse because of the blurred vision. I've been delaying corrective surgery. Why? Fear. But now I think it's time I take care of it. I'm getting a divorce. I worked it out with my ex so I can see my kids. It's a new chapter. I'm starting over. Well, that's a healthy attitude. You're making progress. You care to talk about it over breakfast? Um... [Chuckles] I'm... I'm not asking you out. Consider it punishment for not labeling your meds properly. All right. Let's do it. James Otto : ♪ when that foghorn blows ♪ 
♪ I will be coming home ♪ It's so good to hear your voice. I... I just had the worst night ever. Yeah, well, this guy came in, and he was... [chuckling] What?
