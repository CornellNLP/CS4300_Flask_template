 Previously on "The Night Shift"... 
 I'm pregnant. 
 A promotion? That's even better! 
 No, I-it isn't. 
 I wouldn't work in Texas anymore. 
 I'd have to move to south Carolina. 
 Topher : Did you hear? There's a sniper in San Antonio. 
 We just got to get the hell out of here. 
 All the flights are grounded 'cause of the storm. 
 You're not going anywhere. 
 I'm gonna call Jordan. 
 Jordan! I need some help in here! 
 Help! 
 Reporter : San Antonio has been under siege for the past 48 hours. 
 The death toll stands at eight. 
 Police believe they have the sniper surrounded. 
 In the North Site Parking structure. 
 It took some balls for you to come back out here. 
 Let's go! 
 You know what they say. Got to get right back on the horse, right? 
 Yeah, whoever said that's probably never been shot at. 
 Nothing wrong with being scared. 
 Just proves you're normal. 
 Oh, I'm scared. 
 But I was more scared if I didn't come out tonight, that I never would again, you know? 
 I felt that every day in Iraq. 
 Hey, Kenny, I just checked on Jordan. Still the same. 
 Any word on Gwen and Drew on the site? 
 No, everybody's on radio silence. 
 Just trying to get a glimpse from the news report. 
 T.C. : Kenny, Kenny! Where is Jordan? 
 Up in ICU. Go, go! I got this. 
 Scott's up there with her. Let's take her to trauma 2. 
 Okay. 
 Kenny, call Janet. Let her know I'm here. 
 And I'll be home in an hour. 
 Got it. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Scott : MRI showed a stroke. 
 Clotting from the pregnancy? 
 It looks that way. Yeah. 
 You give her TPA? We did. 
 And we broke up the clot, but she had significant swelling in her brain, and she's been in a coma since the stroke. 
 I've been here with her the whole time. 
 And... and... and the baby? 
 The baby looks fine, for now. 
 But we're monitoring things. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Hey. 
 I'll give you some privacy. 
 So, what happens now? 
 We'll try to make Ali as comfortable as possible until the donor heart arrives, and then Dr. Clemmens will perform the transplant. 
 Hey. How's Jordan? 
 Not good. Still in a coma. 
 We need the swelling to go down. 
 T.C.'s never gonna forgive himself for not being here with her. 
 He was a wreck on that plane. 
 Yeah, well, maybe he never should've left. 
 Hello. I'm Dr. Clemmens. Welcome. 
 This is my wife Farrah. 
 Hello. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Hey, Scott, can I talk to you? 
 Excuse us. 
 He's got a temp of 101. 
 Yeah, I saw that, and we can't do an organ transplant on someone running a fever. 
 If Ali has a-an infection, we put in a new heart, put him on immunosuppresants, he could die. 
 I know. That's why I'm telling you. 
 I didn't want to say anything in front of them. 
 So, we figure out what's causing the fever. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Is something wrong? 
 Um, no. No, no. Everything's fine. 
 We just need to run a few tests. 
 Reporter : Sources tell us law enforcement are in fact communicating with the sniper and hope to resolve... 
 All right, all right. Come on, people. Come on, people. 
 We can't stare at the damn TV all night long. 
 Let's start treating our homeless guests in the waiting room. 
 They probably haven't seen any medical care in a long time. 
 Hey, Paul. Can you help me diagnose? 
 Oh, yeah, sure. No prob. 
 What's the situation with your hand? 
 Still a little weak. 
 Uh, the infection's gone, but I have some nerve damage. 
 My dad's looking at surgical options for me. 
 Ah. 
 If anyone could help, it'll be your dad. 
 Just hope I didn't screw up my peds surgical fellowship. 
 I thought you were still on the fence about that. 
 Losing that choice really puts things into focus, you know. 
 Hey, I just finished the head LAC in 2. 
 Have you heard anything yet? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in. 
 Welcome home, Dr. Chavez. [Laughs] 
 Oh! Good to see you. 
 Ah, you, too. 
 Hell of a night for you to be out driving. 
 Yeah, I had to come in. 
 I'm on the bone-marrow donation list, and, uh, we got a match to a kid in St. Louis, so I got to get to him ASAP. 
 Hey, Kenny. 
 Woman : We do have to... 
 Hey, there he is. 
 But we do know that... 
 Kenny's still mad at me? 
 No. Hardly. Just Gwen's out on the scene that's going down right now. 
 T.C. out there with her? 
 Oh, come on. I'll give you an update. 
 And, oh, F.Y.I., you may be working tonight. All right, great. 
 Yeah. I'll be ready. 
 Carol : We're now gonna go live to a reporter in the field. 
 Woman : Carol, police have asked us to stand even further back as negotiations with the snipers have broken down. 
 The situation here is very... 
 [gunshots] 
 Man : Everybody down! 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Carol : We can't show you exactly what is going on. 
 We do have to keep our distance for safety. 
 What we do know... 
 She's okay. Good. 
 One or multiple... 
 Drew's with her. 
 Yeah. 
 It's almost over. 
 What? 
 It's almost over. 
 How can you tell? 
 I don't hear sniper fire anymore. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Man #1 : We got him! 
 Man #2 : Code 4, suspect in custody. Rooftop is clear. 
 I repeat, rooftop is clear. 
 Clear! We're clear! Let's go, medics! Now! Let's go! 
 Move it! Move it! 
 Get me a 360 perimeter now! 
 Yes, sir! All right! 
 Let's go! Spread out! 
 You need to keep him alive we need to question him. 
 I ain't telling you nothing. You're all going down. 
 Stay there. 
 Gwen : All right, let's get some pressure dressings on these wounds. 
 We'll package him in the rig. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Down! Gunshots! 
 Second shooter. 
 I told you this ain't over. 
 Got a second shooter. 
 Not by a long shot. 
 Clear this place out! 
 Two GSWS... right neck, left hip. 
 Pressure dressings applied. B.P. 80 systolic. 
 Hey, this son of a bitch took a potshot at you? 
 I don't know. There's another one out there. 
 That's right. 
 No one is safe. Anybody who touches me... 
 Hey! Keep your hands off me! 
 Your family dies. [Spits] 
 Aah! 
 Splatter their brains. 
 Hey! Shut your mouth! Damn it! 
 Damn it! Son of a bitch. 
 You're gonna get it next. 
 I'm filling in for Scott. What do we got? 
 Multiple GSWS, pressure is low. Welcome back. 
 All right, yeah, good to be back. 
 Let's get him into Trauma 5. 
 Turn him. Go. 
 Watch him. 
 Drew : Okay, please stay out here. 
 As soon as we're done with him, he's all yours, I promise you. 
 Hey, Kenny, trauma panel. 
 Hang two units of O-neg. 
 Crossbatch another six-pack. 
 [Chuckles] Two six-packs? Hell, make it a case. 
 Joey : Let's get him sedated. 
 No! Keep him awake. 
 We need to be able to ask some questions about the second sniper. 
 I ain't telling you crap. 
 You'll never find him. You're all gonna die!

 [Man groaning] 
 Come on, hey! Why don't you calm down? 
 Why don't you kiss my ass, huh? 
 Superficial zone two through and through confirmed. 
 Jugular vein, carotid artery spared. 
 We got a flag on the play. 
 Third wound in the lateral flank. 
 I need a long wooden Q-Tip. 
 Man : Right here. 
 You should've seen that cop I shot. 
 It was a great shot. 
 Aaah! 
 [Breathing shallowly] 
 Gauze. 
 Right between the eyes. Over 50 yards away. 
 I wonder what the last thing to go through his head was, besides my bullet. Ha! Oh-ohh! 
 You get it? You get it, right? Yeah. I get it. 
 Aah! 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Cummings. This is Dr. Ragosa. 
 Uh, do you mind if we take a look at your forehead? 
 Okay. 
 Okay, all right. Hey, what's your name? 
 Maya. 
 Maya. 
 Okay, Maya. Aah! 
 Oh. That hurts, too? 
 How did this happen? 
 I was in line trying to get into a shelter. 
 They closed the doors when it got too crowded. 
 Everyone started pushing and shoving. 
 I got knocked down and kicked. 
 Sorry. It's been a tough few days. 
 Paul : It's... it's okay. All right. 
 Um, come on, let's get you fixed up.

 Topher : Any word from UNOS? 
 Yeah. I spoke to them, and they're waiting, but if Ali isn't ready for transplant by morning, someone else will get that heart. 
 No! No! Can they do that? 
 Farrah. 
 We'll figure this out before then. 
 It'll be okay. 
 Has this been there? 
 No, Ali, do you feel pain in your chest? 
 No. But I am feeling a bit dizzy. 
 He's bleeding! What is wrong with him? 
 Topher : Farrah, you should step out. 
 No! I will not leave his side. 
 We need to start a platelet transfusion. 
 [Rapid beeping] 
 Ali! Ali! Ali!! 
 Two units of platelets. 
 We believe you may have broken your collarbone. 
 I can't pay. At least, not all of it. 
 I can give you some money. 
 It's fine. Don't worry about it. 
 I do work, at a coffee shop. 
 The boss there is really nice. 
 He lets me snag sandwiches and free pastries. 
 It's not a lot of money. 
 I just can't afford a place yet. 
 So where do you stay? 
 I usually sleep in my car and shower at the "Y." 
 The cops want everyone off the streets, so no sleeping in my car tonight. 
 So I went to the shelter and then... ow... now I'm here. 
 Sounds like a pretty hard day today. 
 Uh, we'll need an X-ray. 
 It is what it is. Life is hard. 
 No one gives you anything for free, except for maybe X-rays. 
 Paul : Mm. 
 Aah. 
 Okay. 
 Let's get this shoulder looked at. 
 Jocelyn, could you help Maya put a gown on? 
 We're gonna step out. 
 Of course. 
 Here you go. 
 [Monitor beeping] I'll be sure to tell her how well you took care of her. 
 Yeah, well, I need the bonus points when she wakes. 
 [Chuckles] 
 T.C. 
 She's seizing. 
 Start a gram of Dilantin and hang some Mag Sulfate. 
 It could be eclampsia. 
 [Rapid beeping] 
 Her sats are down. 
 She's not moving any air. 
 Start an intubation tray. 
 Heart rate's down, T.C. hurry! 
 Baby, come on. 
 Esophagus is clear, neck is stable. 
 Drew, the detective is pushing to come in and question the patient. 
 No way. He comes in here, gets in our way, his only lead dies. He can wait. 
 Joey : This hip wound is tracking towards his abdomen. 
 I need to probe the entrance wound. 
 [Groaning] What are you doing? 
 Come on, man. I need some meds for the pain. 
 No, no, no, no. What you really need is a good lawyer. 
 Okay. Okay, fine. 
 If I tell you where he is, will you give me something for the pain? 
 Yeah, we'll give you something. 
 Okay, I'll tell you where he is. 
 [Weakly] He's at... 
 Hey. 
 Come on. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Aah! 
 [Laughs] 
 You son of a bitch! 
 You all right? Drew, you okay? 
 I told ya I'd get ya. 
 Blood pressure's dropping. 
 The bullet bounced off his ilium into his abdomen. 
 He's bleeding out. 
 We need to get him to the O.R. right now. 
 Move! Move out of the way! 
 Krista, step in. 
 Krista : Ready to go. 
 I have been over and over the labs, and it looks like it is eclampsia, so good call on starting the magnesium when you did. 
 Well, she doesn't have hyperreflexia or edema, so maybe we're just jumping to conclusions. 
 T.C... 
 You guys, I just got a call, so I'll be back as soon as I can, okay? 
 Sure. 
 All right. 
 Look, hey. 
 I can't even imagine how difficult this is, but you know what this means. 
 The pregnancy is toxic to her. 
 Scott. 
 If Jordan was awake, she'd want us to do everything we can to save the baby. 
 [Coughing] 
 Okay, that's not a seizure. She's bucking the ventilator. 
 Hey, hey. Shh. 
 Push a mg of Ativan. 
 [Coughing continues] 
 Hey. Shh. 
 It's uncomfortable. At least that means she can feel it. 
 Okay, it looks like that's working for now, but... 
 Let's run some tests. 
 All right, I want to be 1,000% sure. 
 We're not doing anything drastic unless I'm absolutely certain. 
 [Sighs] I get it. 
 Run your tests. I got to go check on Ali. 
 Call me if you need me. 
 Hey, sweetheart, hey. 
 I'm here, Jordan. I'm here. 
 It's gonna be okay, sweetheart. 
 There you go. Let me see your eyes. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 [Laughs] 
 No funny faces, all right? 
 Why not? 
 We got two more to go. 
 That's why you're in a photo booth, right? 
 Just serious. 
 Okay, fine. Serious, serious, serious.

 Really? 
 Yes. 
 Sorry. 
 I love you.

 ♪♪♪♪♪ 
 So, I wasn't expecting this tonight. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm really worried about Jordan. Jordan's a fighter. 
 She'll pull through. 
 So, after you do this bone-marrow donation, you're leaving again in a few days? 
 Yeah. Liberia. 
 How long are you gone for again? 
 I don't know. As long as they need me. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, but, I mean, I'll have breaks. 
 You could come visit. 
 We could meet up in Italy. You ever been? 
 To Italy? No. 
 Oh, you'll love it. It's great. 
 The Greek isles it's beautiful. 
 We'll have a great time. 
 Woman : Excuse me, Dr. Chavez. 
 The patient is ready. 
 All right. They're ready for us. 
 Yeah. Let's scrub up. 
 Hello. So, uh, sorry about the wait. 
 But the cops have to lock down the hallway because of the sniper, so it's a little backed up in imaging right now. 
 That's so scary. 
 Have there been a lot of victims? 
 From the shooters? Uh, we've had several of them. 
 Really? Did you see anyone die? 
 Actually, the, um... first victim was my patient. 
 No way. What happened? 
 Was in a car accident. 
 Dr. Cummings here found him first. 
 And he died? 
 Never had a chance. His head was wrapped. 
 We thought it was trauma from the accident, but, uh, he had been shot. 
 Yeah, it was my first case. I had to tell his wife. 
 When she came in, she was in so much pain. 
 It was... 
 It was hard. 
 I'll never get used to that. 
 That sounds terrible. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, I'm gonna go see if radiology is open yet. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Uh, do you want any chips or anything? 
 No, no. Thank you. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Ragosa : Yeah, it was my first case. 
 I had to tell his wife. 
 When she came in, she was in so much pain. 
 It was... 
 It was hard. 
 I'll never get used to that. 
 Maya : That sounds terrible. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Topher : The bleeding's stopped, but I still don't know what's causing this. 
 I've got him on broad spectrum antibiotics, but the fever's only going up. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm getting really nervous about this transplant. 
 Yeah, I've been nervous about that since you walked through the door. 
 And UNOS keeps calling for updates. 
 I know, I know. 
 Maybe it's not bacterial. Maybe it's parasitic. 
 I didn't see any bug bites on him, though. 
 At this point, I'm willing to try anything. 
 We'll figure this out. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 Dr. Zia, your wife is here. 
 Janet's here? What the hell? 
 Yeah. 
 Tell her I'll meet her in the break room in a minute. 
 You got it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Is my husband going to die? 
 Farrah, we're gonna do everything we can. 
 You have to do more. You owe him. 
 I know... I know I do. 
 He saved my life. 
 When you left, when the Americans left, do you know what the village elders did to collaborators like Ali? 
 I'm s-sure it was very horrible. 
 They burned down our home because they're afraid the Taliban would kill everyone in the village. 
 We have been through too much. 
 You have to save him. 
 I'm sorry, Topher. 
 Just... 
 Janet's not going to wait. 
 I really think you need to see her, like, now. 
 Okay, okay. 
 I'll be... I'll be right back, I promise. 
 No more promises. Just do it. 
 Just do it. [Crying] 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 It's... it's the middle of the night. 
 There's a sniper out. What are you doing here? 
 What are you doing here? 
 You... you said you were gonna be home as soon as you landed. You haven't even called me. 
 I told Kenny to call you. 
 Kenny is not my husband. 
 Okay, I'm sorry. 
 No. 
 Things with Ali got worse than I anticipated, but I'm fine. I'll be home as soon as... 
 No, no, no, no. I am so tired of you breaking your promises. 
 Janet... do you have any idea what the last few days have been like for me? 
 For Lynn? 
 We had no idea whether or not you were ever coming back. 
 I-I'm back. I'm back now. 
 Are you? 
 Look, I know how much this Ali means to you, but I need us to mean more. 
 You... you are. How can you even... 
 You left your family to go to a war zone when you didn't have to. 
 You could've let someone else take that risk. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No. 
 No, I am just so tired of keeping all this anger in. 
 I-I never asked you to keep it in. Yes, you did. 
 No. 
 Yeah, you don't know it, but you do. 
 You need your rest from work, you need to talk to your patients 24/7, and I try to leave you alone, but I never get the time just to be angry, too. 
 And this was the last straw. 
 I am done. 
 [Scoffs] What are you saying? 
 I'm saying that I came here to say to you in person... 
 Not to come home. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I'm sorry. Janet... 
 Topher, I need... I need time, okay? 
 I just [Sighs] 
 I am so happy that you're home and that you're okay, but I can't do this anymore. 
 You... Janet, I'm sorry! 
 Just wait! 
 Hey, Janet. 
 What... what is it, Drew? 
 Uh, I just got of the phone with UNOS. 
 They have another recipient for the heart and they wanted to know the status of Ali. 
 What... what did you tell them? 
 I said he was fine. 
 Okay. 
 But you know that if he's not ready for that transplant in the next couple of hours, they are moving on. 
 Got it, got it. Good, thanks. 
 Thanks.

 You can't rush it, Toph. 
 Ali's tests are gonna take what they take. 
 I-I know, I'm sorry. 
 Last few days have been hard. 
 Little on edge. 
 It's always something, isn't it? 
 I still don't know whether Rick's gonna stay here or take his dream job training recruits for combat in south Carolina. 
 You guys just got back together. 
 Yeah. Life's a bitch, ain't it? 
 Topher. There are no reports yet, but the slides are up. 
 I want to look at it myself. 
 This isn't malaria. Come here. Look at this. 
 See that? Those are broken blood cells... schistocytes. 
 Okay, so fever, anemia, schistocytes. 
 It's not an infection. 
 Exactly. It's T.T.P. It's a blood disorder. 
 At least we know what's wrong with him. 
 We need to replace the plasma in his blood. 
 Mollie, can we get a blood-cell separator for Trauma 2? 
 Do you think one round of plasma exchange is gonna be enough? 
 It's gonna have to be. 
 We only have until morning before we lose the heart. 
 Yeah.

 [Breathes deeply] Yeah. 
 Gwen, you're too good to me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 How are you holding up, Scott? 
 [Sighs] 
 I've been better. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know, I always thought it'd be you in there with her. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 Oh, that feels better. 
 You'll have to wear this for a few weeks, but then you should expect a full recovery. 
 As long as I can make a latte, I'm cool. 
 Paul, check the attitude on this one, huh? 
 Maybe you can learn something. 
 It's never as bad as you think, huh? 
 That's what I try to always say. 
 I will, uh, keep that in mind. 
 All right, so, let's get you your meds, and then, uh, you'll be as good as new, okay? 
 Yeah, except... 
 What? 
 Well, it's fine if the answer's no, but is it okay if I take a nap here? 
 It's been a while since I've slept in a real bed. 
 Uh, yeah, yeah. I guess. 
 Um, we'll just have to move you if there are any emergency cases, okay? 
 Thanks so much. You guys are the best. 
 Hey, you guys heard the news? 
 The sniper died on the table. 
 Ah. Did they get anything out of him? 
 I'm not sure, but I heard the cops found the car and they're dusting for prints. 
 I hope they can kill that other b*st*rd, too. 
 Sorry for the rough language, honey. 
 It's just got me all worked up. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm just tired. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Thank you, Gwen. 
 Anything I can do, Tee. Whatever you need. 
 I know. How's Ali? 
 Well, we're doing the plasma exchange. 
 We'll know in a few hours if it's working. 
 If it doesn't, the heart goes to the next person on the list. 
 After all that... 
 Yeah. 
 After all that. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Sighs] 
 Come on, Jordan. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Whoa! 
 [Tires screech] 
 Oh-ho. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Um... [Sighs] I'm sorry. 
 Is this... is this you? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, man, I'm sorry. I was just... you know, I was... I was in a hurry, and I wasn't paying any attention and I... 
 [Sighs] 
 You know what? These things happen. 
 It's... this doesn't even look that bad. 
 What's your big hurry? 
 Uh, blind date. [Chuckles] 
 Coming or leaving? 
 I'm leaving. Definitely leaving. 
 "Escaping" is more like it. 
 Oof. That bad, huh? 
 Oh. Um, you know, it probably wasn't even really the guy's fault. 
 It's just first date after the breakup, and it's been six months, but my friend, she told me to get back on the horse. 
 It just turns out... not that horse. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Um, you are waiting for my insurance card, and [Chuckles] I am standing here blabbering like an idiot about my love life. 
 Uh, you know what? Hang on. 
 Hang on, hang on. I got a better idea. 
 How about you buy me dessert, I'll pay for dinner, and we call it even? 
 Uh... 
 Dessert doesn't really cover that scratch. 
 Uh, no, no. It probably doesn't, but ending my bad streak of first dates might. 
 What do you say? 
 Okay. [Chuckles] 
 Okay. Scott. 
 Jordan. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Hey. Hey, Paul. 
 Hey. 
 I'm, uh, I'm sorry about earlier. 
 Saying that you could've learned from Maya, you know, I didn't mean to make light of your problem. 
 No, not at all, man. Uh, you were right. 
 And, uh, in other news, I just heard from my dad. 
 Uh, he found a surgery for my hand. 
 50% chance I regain full function, and, um, 50% chance they cause further damage. 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 Those are not good odds. 
 Well, what if you don't have the surgery? 
 Well, a slow recovery. 
 I mean, I would... I would never be a surgeon, but I could be a functioning E.R. Doc in a couple weeks. 
 It's your choice, right? 
 Bird in the hand? 
 Yeah, um, I hadn't really thought about it. 
 Uh, what... what are you... what do you think? 
 I don't know, man. 
 It's your life, but take it from a guy who blew it 20 years ago. 
 You could lose all this. 
 I don't know if it's worth the risk, you know? 
 Hey. Why don't we sit down after the shift, make a list, talk to Scott? 
 Everybody pipe down! 
 They have a picture of the second sniper. 
 Woman : Police officials say that fingerprints have revealed the identity of the second sniper. 
 Her name is Brianna Ward. 
 Investigators are asking anyone with information to... 
 Holy cow. Officer, she's here! 
 Contact San Antonio police immediately. Do not approach. 
 She is considered armed and dangerous. 
 Maya! We know who you a... 
 Jocelyn, get me Dr. Chavez now! 
 [Flatline] 
 All right, I'm inflating the cuff and using it as a tourniquet. 
 Hang another saline. 
 Here. 
 We found her coded. She bled out. 
 Use the O-Negative. 
 She's the second shooter? 
 Yeah. 
 Come on. 
 You don't get to decide how you die. 
 Anybody know how long she's been bleeding? 
 Long enough. 
 Hold CPR. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Drew : Her B.P.'s coming back. 
 Come on. 
 B.P. 90 systolic. She's stabilizing. 
 Okay, good. Hang another two units of blood. 
 I want her healthy for her day in court. 
 Let's get her to Trauma 1 right now. 
 Yeah, nice save. 
 I should've known. 
 She seemed, uh... 
 I feel so stupid! 
 I really believed her. 
 Yeah, we both did. 
 That's why I'm getting the surgery on my hand. 
 I thought you'd want to wait to think about it some more. 
 This sealed it. 
 I can't keep a professional boundary when I see pain every day. 
 You know, this isn't even first case. 
 I mean, I need... I need the distance of surgery. 
 I need to be somewhere where every case isn't like a gut punch. 
 You know, where it doesn't stick with me for a week. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Where I don't end up going fishing with my dead patient's dad, you know? 
 And if the surgery doesn't work? 
 Yeah, I'll deal with that then. 
 I'll deal with that then. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Gasps] She squeezed my hand. 
 Purposeful movements. 
 Must mean the swelling in her brain is going down. 
 Jordan? 
 Don't you go scaring us like that again, okay? 
 Hey, Jordan. 
 We're here with you. 
 Hey, come on. 
 Oh, God, is she... 
 [Sighs] Looks like it. 
 You need some time alone with her? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 You're okay. 
 The baby? 
 No. Shh, shh, shh. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 Farrah. 
 I'm here, Ali. 
 You made it. 
 You are going to get your heart. 
 Topher : The treatment worked. 
 Dr. Clemmens is gonna take you to the O.R. 
 I don't know how to thank you, Topher. 
 The lengths you have gone through to make this happen. 
 You are a man of your word. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry I was so angry with you before. 
 [Chuckles] I seem to bring that out in wives. 
 Never mind. It's inside joke. 
 I hear we're ready for transplant. 
 Yes. 
 There are no words for what you have given us. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Here we go. 
 Hey. Looks like the second sniper pulled through. 
 Yeah. Healthy enough to rot in jail the rest of her life. 
 What are you doing? 
 Want to... want to go for breakfast? 
 Maybe we can have our first real date. 
 Um... 
 I really like you, Joey. 
 Ah. 
 Yeah. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But I can't date you. 
 And it wouldn't really be a date, would it? 
 'Cause you're here for a couple days, and then what? 
 I mean, you... 
 You go back to Liberia, and I stay here? 
 No, I mean... 
 We just keep having fun, and... 
 [Sighs] 
 We see where it goes. 
 Your contract is for three years, Joey. 
 I don't want to be in a holding pattern for that long. 
 [Sighs] I... we're just... 
 Victims of bad timing. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 It's, uh, the story of my life.

 Mine, too.
