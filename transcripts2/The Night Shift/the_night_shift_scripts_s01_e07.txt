 [siren wails] 
 The O.R. called back. They're ready for him. 
 T.C. : Let's get moving. 
 Topher : Little help, Dwayne? 
 [door opens and closes] 
 Man : Hey. Is he talking yet? 
 Hey, I'm s... I'm sorry. This is a restricted area, and we need to get him to the O.R. 
 No one's going anywhere. 
 Is that so? 
 Uhh! 
 Hey! 
 Think I'm playing, Doc? 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Get him talking now. 
 It's not that easy. 
 Just do it, You don't have to point that. T.C. : He has a severe crush injury... Just do it! Anesthetic is in. Thank you. Hmm. What were you fishing for? Oh, catfish, sunfish, striped bass. Hey. You wanted to see me? Yeah. This is Mr. Perez. I need you to stabilize the base so I can cut the barb and back the rest out. Okay. How you doing today, Mr. Perez? I'm doing good, Doc. Good. Jordan : Thank you. So... everything good with you and Scott? All good. We'll talk about it later. T.C. : Okay. [snip] Tee! We just got a call. Small plane went down near Government Canyon Park. Two passengers. There's no road access. They gotta chopper us in. I'll handle it. Just get Krista to come in. Where were we? You're kinda sweet on him, aren't you? Ow! [hook clatters] We're all done. Be careful out there. So you're gonna have the eye surgery? Yeah, in a couple of months. Scott got me to the top of the list... [elevator bell dings] at Dallas Memorial with Dr. Clodfelter. That's exciting. Yeah. And how much will it improve your vision? Well, with the new laser technique, he says up to 50%. Wow. It's gonna change your life. Yeah. Man : [filtered voice] So three tours in Afghanistan, huh? T.C. : [filtered voice] Yeah. Wow. I did a double. We lost a lot of good men over there. Yeah, we did. Keep your head down, baby brother. [gunfire] It's a long way from shooting B.B. guns in the backyard, Eh, Tee? Yeah. I don't think Mom would like this, but Dad might. [rapid gunfire] We're moving in! Don't you think we should wait for support first? [sighs] Quit being such a sissy doctor, baby bro. You take the back entrance. Watch your six. [gunfire continues] [filtered voice] I gotta say, I never liked riding in choppers. They always feel like they're about to crash. Thad : Move! Move! Move! Move! Go! Go! Go! Cover me! [rapid gunfire] Man : Dr. Callahan? Doctor? Dr. Callahan? We're coming up on the site. Right. Right. There they are. Hey, get us down there ASAP. Man : I can't. There's no place to land with all these trees. All I can do is drop you all a couple miles back, And you can hike in. No, no, no! They'll... they'll be dead by the time we hike in. Sorry. It's too dangerous. [under breath] Here we go. Topher... What do you say we do this old school, huh? Son of a bitch. I knew you were gonna suggest that. 24-year-old female, status post 8-foot fall from pole With cervical flexion injury. Kenny : A pole? What kind of pole? Um... A stripper pole. I dance at the Bare Trap Gentlemen's Club Over by the Pan Am Expressway. I can't believe I fell off. It's never happened before. Drew : Let's take her to Exam 1, get some x-rays. I'm Dr. Alister. We'll be checking you over, make sure everything's okay. Paul. Paul? Looks like you wanna help out with this one? Uh, yes, yes, yes. Let's do it. [clears throat] Dr. Cummings. Uh, so nice to meet you. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Hey. Paul, a little hint... Her eyes? They're up here. Of course. All right? I got... yeah. Okay. Good talk. [helicopter blades continue wurring] You ready? See ya down there! T.C. : This guy's dead. We got another one over here. This one's still alive. Grab his legs. [grunts] Hey. Hey. I'm Dr. Callahan. We're gonna help you. What's your name, buddy? [weakly] Eric. We were flying back from our annual golf retreat. The engine stalled out of nowhere. How's Barry? You mean the pilot? I'm... I'm sorry. He didn't... Eric? Eric! I'm losing his pulse. Start C.P.R. Oh, this is not good. What? His chest wall's collapsed. We gotta pop the clavicle out or he's a dead man. [panting] Hold him down. Yeah. [whispers] All right. [grunts] Come on. Come on. Uhh! [inhales deeply] Yeah. [static] Send the basket down right now. We gotta get him out of here. [static] Man: Copy that. On its way. Let's place him in a "c" collar and get him ready for evac. Whoa. Look at this. Hello! I don't think these guys were golfing. [intercom beeps, siren wailing in distance] [woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [static] Incoming. Krista, you're up. 16-year-old healthy female with shortness of breath. Unclear etiology. What's your daughter's name? Woman : Nina. Okay. We'll take a listen. Sats are normal and lungs are clear. Nina, I'm Dr. Bell-Hart. What's going on? There's a problem with your throat? Holy crap. What is it? She swallowed a fork. What?! A fork? Heather, take care of the parents. Let's get her into Trauma 1. It's okay. I'm right here, honey. ♪♪♪ I see the fork. Good. Now firmly grab it at the base and gently pull. [metal clinks] Damn it. I lost it. It... it slipped further down. [monitor beeping rapidly] Sats are dropping. Pulse ox is down to 83. Okay, Krista, we have to do this now. [metal clinks] [breathing heavily] I-I can't grab it. Yeah, you can. Sats are 79%. Okay, focus. [monitor beeping rapidly] [inhales deeply] Breathe. [metal clinks] Wait. I got it. Okay, good. Pull it out. [gasps] Okay. [fork clatters] [monitor continues beeping rapidly] Okay. Sats coming up. Very good, Krista. Now all we have to do is figure out how the hell it got in there. [monitor beeping steadily] Lauren, send off a trauma panel and notify the blood bank We're activating the massive transfusion protocol. Lauren : Yes, Doctor. Dr. Callahan, this is Agent Milo Osbourne of the D.E.A. He is assigned to the case. FBI was tracking a small plane that was flying low over the border, carried suspected smugglers. Made a stop in Brownsville, and then the feds just blew it and lost it. Anybody else on board? Pilot was D.O.A. This was the only guy... And some of these. Okay, I'll take that for evidence. How soon can I talk to him? Hey, hey, hey. We have to stabilize him first. He has a severe crush injury to his chest and abdomen. And we'll let you know when he's speaking. [velcro rips] So, I'm okay? Yeah, you look great. The x-rays are... are normal. Uh, we think it's just a strain, so... Yeah, we're just waiting on the labs. We wanna make double sure you're okay. Listen, boys, I appreciate the concern, but I gotta get back to work. If I leave now, I can still make some decent cash tonight. [pager beeps] Yeah, I gotta go deal with another patient. Candy, I can promise you it's gonna be a half-hour tops. Paul, don't let her leave. He's cute. Too bad he's gay. [door closes] Wait. How'd you know that? I get stared at by men for a living. I know when somebody's not looking at me Like the way you are now. No. No, no, no. I-I mean, you're... you're my patient, Uh, so I have to look at you. Uh, how could I not look at you? It's okay. I don't mind. You know what? I'm sorry. I gotta get back. Just call me at the Trap if there's a problem. [paper rustles] H-how much money would you need to stay And maybe help me out? 'Cause I was just thinking, um... Thinking what? Well, um, my girlfriend comes into town tomorrow, And she has never exactly spent the night before. So I thought you might be able to help me with that. You're a virgin. That's so cute. But I'm not a hooker, you know? There is a difference. No, no, no. I wasn't... I wasn't suggesting that... Uh, could you come back, please? Please? Thank you. Okay, I just thought... I have a lot of questions about... about women, And if I ask the guys, they would never, ever let me live it down. You know? I mean, I haven't even told them that she's coming. So look, if... if I paid you for your time, Could you maybe clear up some things for me? You know, the how-to's, the when-to's. [monitor beeping steadily] Hi, Nina. Are you feeling better now? Good. I'm Dr. Bell-Hart. I... Took the fork out of your throat. Thanks. So listen, I'm pretty sure you weren't... Trying to hurt yourself. But I have a good idea how the fork got down there. Your loss of tooth enamel... And the calluses on your fingers. These are all signs of bulimia. I'm not bulimic. You know... [sighs] The reason why I recognize these signs Is not because I'm a doctor. It's because... I was bulimic through most of high school. You know, when I first saw that fork, I thought, "maybe I should step in here." And then when she didn't get it at first, The seconds, they felt like hours. But she pulled through, so I was proud of her. Yeah? Well, you're good at it. I don't have the patience to deal with teaching the interns. Well, didn't somebody teach you? I'm a bit of a... lone wolf. [lowered voice] Is it me, or does Ragosa have a thing for you? He just got divorced. He's got a thing for everyone. Oh. I'm gonna talk to the girl's parents. Let me know when she wakes up. Will do. [woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] And when that didn't work, I used to, um... [voice breaks] put my mom's cake spatulas down my throat. So... Do you wanna talk to me? I know it's hard to say out loud. I know. But I'm here for you. I've been... [inhales deeply] [voice breaks] making myself throw up since I was 12. It's so hard now. I have to dig really deep just to gag. And you lost... [inhales deeply] Lost hold of the fork. I really want to stop, but I can't. I'm gonna help you, Nina, And you're going to be okay. I promise. [door creaks] Hmm. [door closes] So this will be my first time, and I just... I don't want to look stupid, you know? Like... like, I've... I've read things, I've, uh, watched things. But I'm afraid if I do anything wrong, she's gonna laugh. So if... You talk too much, Paul. Yeah, I've been told that before. Sure. But you're cute. And you helped me, so I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna give you a lap dance... A really good lap dance. [vest clatters] No, no, no. That's not what I... A $200 lap dance on the house. Listen, you don't need to do that, all right? Answering questions would suffice. [hip-hop playing] What'd I say about talking, Paul? You won't shut up because you're afraid. Women don't like men who are afraid, Paul. Your girlfriend wants a confident man. Got it? Okay. See what happens when you just be quiet and let things happen? Uh... Man : ♪ got all the right moves ♪ Yeah. Quiet. Right. ♪♪♪ Uh... [chuckles nervously] So are you... are you just dancing until you figure out something else to do with your life? Mood killer, Paul. Tell me I look beautiful. You look beautiful. See? That's how you talk to a woman. ♪♪♪ So... Let me ask you something. Okay. Can you get me prescriptions? Uh, I don't... I don't know. I'd pay for them. They're for my urinary infections. Okay. You wouldn't believe how many I get a year from those nasty poles. Yeah. Our stupid manager never cleans them. And each time at the clinic, it's, like, a 4-hour wait Just to get a prescription. So if you could help me, that'd be awesome. Uh, what do you... what do you take for them? Usually Cipr... Cip... Cip... Sorry, what? [groans and whimpers] [smack] Ow. Oh. Gosh. C-Candy? Um... Help. Uh... Start the F.F.P. Knock, knock. [monitor beeping steadily] He do any talking yet? Just mumbling. He's barely conscious. You two guys were on the scene. Did he say anything there? Just a lot of moaning. What about the pilot? Can you describe him? Dead. Don't be a smart-ass. Was he hispanic or white or what? [ultrasound whooshing] White and dead. All right. Did you notice any other drugs on board? It was dark. Hey, we're trying to work here, So if you could just wait outside... Hey, Tee. Look at this. What? What's going on? His abdomen's filled with blood. He's gonna need surgery. Jocelyn, call the O.R. and tell them to prep for an ex-lap. We're gonna go by C.T. for a quick chest and head. You can talk to him post-op, but that'll be a few hours. Our waiting room is right there. Okay. You got your security badge? I forgot mine. Do not fret or be blue! This badge will get us through. Yeah, don't worry. He's in my custody. I said don't worry. I got it. I'm... I'm not really sure what happened. Uh... Just keep your hands up for me. She's having a stroke. Oh, God. She's paralyzed on the right side. Hey, why'd you guys page me to... Whoa! What happened to her? Paul : She... she fell. She fell? Yeah. Let's get her up. We're gonna take care of you, Candy. One, two, three. I'll get the door. How is she? [door closes] Uh, we got the fork out, and she's stable but a little sleepy from the anesthesia. So when can we take her home? I actually don't think that she should go home yet. Why? Nina has an eating disorder. Bulimia. And she needs to be treated with inpatient psychiatric care. Our daughter's not crazy. I-I didn't say she was. Uh, she just needs... So she wishes she was skinnier. Do you know any teenage girls that don't? She's not missing school because some doctor's overreacting. She swallowed a fork. She's just stressed out from school. If we need help, we'll call our priest. Now where do I sign to take her home? [classical music playing] Hey, guys. This a social visit or strictly business? What do you think, Dwayne? [door closes] That was sarcasm. [music stops] Next time, I'll text it with an emoticon. T.C. : A little grumpy tonight, Dwayne? I'm hypoglycemic and I forgot my candy bar. Here's a fiver for the vending machine. Knock yourself out when we're done. It only takes ones. What? Dwayne : How about some old school? [beep] Man : Bust it. [Young MC's "Bust a Move" playing] Hey, Topher! ["Bust a Move" playing] Let's see your moves. See if you can keep up with Baltimore's finest, baby. Man : Ohh! ♪ 'cause you're overzealous, play hard to get ♪ Soldiers : Ohh! Go, Thad! Uh-oh. Yeah! Whoo! [cheering] Pow! Come on! All right, you're up, Topher! Hey, Jordan, this is Captain Topher M.D. He's a newbie, so... Don't expect too much. Okay. Go. ♪ But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants ♪ Whoa! Ohh! What?! ♪ sits down next to you and starts talkin' ♪ 
♪ says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove ♪ 
♪ so come on, fatso, and just bust a move ♪ [cheering] Whoa! This dance floor I be hoardin' To send love to you, Miss Jordan. Soldiers : Ohh! What?! [laughs] Jordan's gonna fall for this guy. She's never gonna marry you. Oh, you're engaged? Well, well, if she says "yes." I'm gonna ask her when I get back. [loud explosion] all : [shouting] Thad : Get down! Down! Tee? [heartbeat thumping] Tee. Tee? Yeah? Little help? Yeah. Yeah, let's... let's do it. Paul : She's gonna be out of it for a little while. What did the M.R.I. say? M.R.I.'s clean. It doesn't make any sense. What's wrong with her? I don't know. So, Paul, give it up. What happened? S-sorry. Uh, she was d-dancing. Dancing? But what... what were you doing in the, uh... Oh! [gasps] you paid her for a lap dance! [laughs] What, you paid her for a lap dance? Look, look, can... Can we just find out why she's stroking out? I'm sorry. Sorry. Mm! Look! See? Maybe it was all your built-up virgin pressure. It's not funny, okay? Candy's condition's not funny. You getting a lap dance in the supply closet is hysterical. Give us a heads-up next time. I'd cover for you. God knows Drew can keep a secret, too. Look, there's not gonna be a next time, okay? Hey, you're not gonna tell Jordan About the lap dance, right? I don't think her gyrating on you is related to her condition. Let's just get her in the room and run some tests. Well, you can send the detective over, But he'll have a long wait. From what I understand, The patient is getting a scan and heading to the O.R. Besides, we already have a D.E.A. agent here. You wanna talk to him? Okay, hold on. Agent Osbourne, S.A.P.D. They say they may wait a while before they get here, but they wanna talk to you. No. God, no. No. No, my boss will kill me if I get involved with the locals. No. I don't want to get in the middle of your crap. You hear me? Hey. Listen, we're really busy here. Okay? You guys can handle all your jurisdictional stuff when you get here. Well, then talk to him tomorrow. I-I... I gotta go. [hangs up receiver] [woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [bell dings] [beep] What? What do you mean you can't put an involuntary hold on Nina? Is she an adult? No, no, she's 16. Is she suicidal? No, not yet. Okay, then. If she is not suicidal, homicidal, or gravely disabled, and... [inhales deeply] Just so you understand, there is a big stigma against psychiatric care in the Latino community. They tend not to seek it out. The best I can do is offer outpatient resources. This is just so messed up. Yeah, trust me. I get it. Hey. [exhales deeply] Krista, you need to show Dr. De La Cruz some respect. Yelling at an attending isn't gonna help your patient. You're right. I'm sorry. Isn't there anything you can do as... as the Night Shift Chief? No. And look, I would love to, But you need to learn that the hardest part of residency is that you can't save everyone. So... What do I tell her? I-I promised her that I was going to help her. I already spoke to the parents. I can try again, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. [whispers] Okay. So what did you mean By "God knows Drew can keep a secret"? We cool? Yeah. It was nothing, man. I was just kidding. Were ya? I thought I heard a little edge in there. You know? Had a little something to it. [sighs] Okay, uh, I know this sounds... Wow. I was about to say "gay." Look, man, I just, uh... Um... I-I don't care, man. I-I really don't. Rick seems like a really cool guy, and I'm glad he's feeling better. Hey. Just spit it out. [lowered voice] All right, fine. I was pissed that you didn't think you could tell me. Quite honestly, I still am. I mean, come on, man. It's me. It's me. Dude, I-I would never turn my back on you. Ever. And just knowing that you felt like you had to shoulder this whole thing by yourself and live a lie around me? Man, that kills me. I guess I just thought we were better friends than that, that's all. You're right. It sounded a little gay. [stifles laugh] Come on, man. You can't take it personal. It's not about you. It was about me. It was my thing. Okay? So we cool? Yeah, we're good, man. [chuckles] Stupid face. [laughs] [groans] [laughs] Anyways, about that, uh, that Krista situation... Now that she's done bearding for you, you gonna help me out with her or not, huh? Yeah? Dude, I've been trying. If you'd stop playing so much, maybe you'd get somewhere. Playing? I'm... I'm not a player. [laughs] I-I'm not a player, dude. I just crush a lot. The O.R. called back. They're ready for him. T.C. : Let's get moving. Little help, Dwayne? 
 
 Milo : Hey. Is he talking yet? Hey. I'm s... I'm sorry, Agent. I didn't catch your name. This is a restricted area and we need to get him to the O.R. No one's going anywhere. Is that so? Uhh! Hey! Think I'm playing, Doc? It's okay. It's okay. Get him talking. It's not that easy. Just do it, or I'm gonna kill every one of you. You don't have to point that. What... [silenced gunshot] How's that? [inhales sharply] T.C. : Dwayne? Dwayne! He's dead. Well, now I have your attention. He has a belly full of blood. And he's gonna die if we don't get him to the O.R. Just shut up and get over there against the wall. Topher : All right. And turn around! I'm gonna have a little conversation with him, and then I'll be on my way. [monitor beeping steadily] [whispers] Oh, God. Dwayne. Milo : You, come on. I know. I know. Just do what he says so we're not next. Shut up over there. [muffled voice] I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. Yeah, you're damn right you're sorry. What are you trying to do, double-cross me? Tell me where our money is. Brownsville. Huh? Brownsville. Tell me! [flatlining] Hey! Wake up, you b*st*rd! Come on! What's the address? What the hell's wrong with him? Get over here and just make him talk. [monitor beeping steadily] Wake him up. He's losing his pulse. If... if you ever want him to speak again,  He needs an O.R. now. He's not going to the O.R. I need him to talk for a minute, and then I'll be on my way. You don't understand. You don't understand. His blood pressure dropped too low for him to wake up. No, you don't understand. I vouched for this piece of crap, okay? If I don't get what I need from him, I'm a dead man. So he dies, and you two are gonna join your friend over there. I got nothin' to lose, pal. [monitor beeping steadily] Drew : She had all the symptoms of left M.C.A. stroke. Loss of speech, right-sided weakness with collapse, But her M.R.I. was normal. And she collapsed as she was leaving? Actually, um... Yeah. In the hallway, by the storage room. Yeah, I think she was looking for the restroom. And what's her status now? The initial stroke symptoms resolved, but she's having migratory weakness... Squeeze my hand. Intermittent loss of vision and speech. And this all started with a fall on her neck? Can you push? Yes. [clears throat] She fell off her pole. Apparently they are very dirty and slippery. Sounds like somebody's been doing his homework. And it also sounds like she has a vertebral artery dissection. That's a tear in the wall of the artery That causes a flap that blocks blood flow to the brain. Okay? Drew : So we order a C.T. angiogram, We start her on heparin, and we call Vascular. Exactly. On it. Don't worry. We're gonna take care of you. You'll be okay. [monitor continues beeping steadily] Hey, look. It's not your fault. Look, if you hadn't gotten the lap dance, she might've stroked out while driving. You're like our little, um... Virgin hero. Yeah, what's wrong with his breathing? [wheezing and gasping] The crush injury to his throat must've caused laryngeal swelling. Well, fix it. That's why we need an O.R. You're not going to the O.R.! I'm not taking that chance! We know. We're gonna get him tubed before we lose the airway. We're on it. Just do it. We have an E.T. tube, but no laryngoscope. We'll never get it in without the scope. We won't be able to see what we're doing. [loud rapid beeping] What is that? What's the beeping? I told you. He needs the O.R. Toph. Toph. Okay. What are you doin'? Topher : He's going into respiratory failure. His throat's closed. We need to breathe for him. This will act as a lighted stylet. It just might work. Turn down the light. Do it if you wanna talk to him. It will let us see where we are. [beeping continues] Come on. Come on. Let's go. Why is this taking so long? Come on. Get in. You better not lose him. You're almost there. That's it. Advancing the tube. [whispers] Okay. Good. Is that it? Is it gonna work? You're in. Good. Good. [beeping stops] [sighs] So when do I get my room upstairs? [Damien Jurado's "Sheets" playing] You're gonna come visit, right? ♪ Is he still coming around ♪ I'm sorry, Nina, but your parents won't let us admit you, and they wanna take you home. But... you can force them. ♪ his head ♪ You're the doctor. I can't. I did everything I could think of to make it happen, But it didn't work. ♪ Lord knows I don't want to compete ♪ But you promised.

Kenny : Systolic down to 70. Sats 88. Okay, what's going on? Blood pressure and O2 just cratered. Hanging pressors now. So what'd the scans say? Was it a dissection? No. It was completely clear. Then what's causing all this? I don't know. All right, I'll get T.C. and Topher down here. Just start her on high flow oxygen. Jordan : Mollie, page T.C. and Topher. Non-rebreather. [monitor beeping rhythmically] [telephone rings] [ring] Any more sutures? This is it. [ring] Think... Have you stopped the bleeding? The clips. The clips on the folders. We can use them to... to clamp the bleeders. Okay, I need you to either bag or pull the clips off the folders. No, no, no, no. You stay right there. I'll get the clamps. [whispers] This is a mess, Tee. [whispers] Yeah. Half his blood volume is... is in his abdomen. We're out of supplies. He's not gonna make it. That's great. Uh, get all of them. Woman over P.A. : Dr. Callahan and Dr. Zia... This'll have to do. Please report to the O.R. Yeah. [exhales sharply] [pager beeping] [beeping stops] They're looking for us. Why don't you just take off? Yeah. Okay. Uhh! Listen to me! I'm getting pretty sick of your mouth! Back off, you! Now page 'em back and tell 'em everything's cool. You understand? Go. Hey, T.C. and Topher said they're still there. They'll be down soon. Okay. I'll be in Trauma 3 with Drew. Gotcha. Okay. Sign here, date there, and that states that you are leaving against medical advice. Landry : We really wish you'd reconsider. We can get Nina treatment And be in and out of here in a few days. Thank you, but we know our daughter. I need a doctor in here now! I came to get her dressed, but she was unresponsive and hypotensive. Nina! Nina. Nina, talk to me. Talk to me! Oh, my God. I think she swallowed a scalpel. What?! Mollie, get Dr. Alexander, please. She's gonna vomit! Turn her! Turn her! Turn her! [gagging] Oh, my God! Krista : Get them out of here! Woman : Oh, God! Get them out! What's happening?! No! [monitor beeping steadily] Joanna : Pressure's up. 2 units running in. Good. Opening the fundus now. [monitor beeping steadily] Suction. [gurgling] There it is. I see it. Easy, Krista. Nice job. Unbelievable. I know. Maybe now her parents will realize that she has a problem. Yeah. [door bangs open] Jordan, we need you. It's Candy. Okay. Close her up, run in another 2 units, and move her up to the O.R. Will do. [instrument clatters] [flatlining] Come on. Come on. That looks really bad. You need to keep him alive. Topher : His vitals are dropping. Stay with me, Thad. Okay. [panting] Stay with me, Thad. Come on. Come on. I gotcha. Milo : Doc? Come on. Hey, Doc! I, uh... What? I-I got an idea. Topher, hand me those clips. [monitor beeping rapidly] She didn't respond to the pressors or the high flow oxygen. She's on 100% non-rebreather And her sats are still in the 80s. Okay. Send a stat arterial blood gas. We need to know her acid/base status. On it. And where's her chart? Where the hell are T.C. and Topher? They should've been down here by now. Could be, uh, P.E., but her D-dimer is negative. Uh, it could be an M.I., but her troponin is negative. Could be cardiogenic shock... Her echo is normal. Man, what the heck? That's way too dark for arterial blood. You must've been in a vein. Do it again. Look, I know when I'm in a vein and when I'm in an artery. It doesn't even look like venous blood. It looks like... chocolate or something. Go get methylene blue. Now! Now! Okay. W-why? Earlier, when Candy was giving me a lap dance, She kept mentioning recurrent U.T.I.s and... and having trouble getting in to see a doctor. I-if she was taking over-the-counter U.T.I. meds, Like phenazopyridine, and she kept taking too much, it would eventually cause... Methemoglobinemia. Yes. That would explain the altered mental status, the strokes symptoms, and the unresponsive oxygen level. Okay. That's probably why she fell off the pole in the first place. Yes. Paul : All right, come on. Gotta get this running. [monitor beeping steadily] It's working. It's definitely working. I'm sorry. Paul, did you say "lap dance"? Are you getting lap dances in my E.R.? Uh... look, I need to recheck her vitals. Excuse me. Jordan, I need you. We are not done with this. Man, I gotta hand it to you. I did not think you had the balls to get a lap dance at work. Little boy's growing up, huh? [chuckles] T.C. and Topher have been gone for, like, 45 minutes. They're still not back from radiology? No. And there's a chemical factory explosion in Selma. This place is gonna be swamped in no time. I'm going up there. [woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Krista : I'll meet you in the O.R. Yes, Doctor. [telephone rings] [scoffs] Her vital are stable. We're moving her to the O.R. And we... we took this out of her stomach. [gasps] Is this real enough for you? What the hell is she doing? Let her do it. They need it. Your daughter is sick, and if you don't admit her, something like this will happen again. Oh, my God, Robert. Oh, my God. Just tell us she'll be okay. [sniffles] We're gonna do our best. [woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Pretty ballsy. That's the kind of thing that gets you fired. I just couldn't help myself. I was so mad. Good. There's nothing wrong with being pissed off. Just remember, it's not gonna work every time. Guess I'm just gonna have to get fired a lot then. [knock on door] Jordan : T.C., open the door! Who the hell's that?! Come on, guys. Why is this door locked? Forget it. Just get the door and make her go away. And don't... don't do anything stupid. I'm... [knock on door] What's going on? Hello? T.C.? Hello? Dwayne? Move this. [metal cabinet clanks] Shh. [whispers] I'm watching you. [unlocks door] Hey. What the hell's going on in here? Why is this door locked? Yeah, sorry. Just, you know, we, uh... The guy kept moving, so we had to rescan him a bunch of times. Dwayne went to go get some more contrast, and... Tee, you're bleeding. What in the... You know... Come on! Hey! Get in here! Oh, my God. Don't move! Now close the door and block it! Don't think I won't use it. Get against that wall. [cabinet rolling] Now! Right there! Get against that wall! Okay! I'm going! I'm going! Right there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dwayne? Hey! Hey! Stop it! Jordan. Jordan. Hey. Take it easy. It's gonna be okay. Woman on TV : This factory fire in Selma continues to rage out of control. Come on, people! Let's clear out the trauma rooms! I'm setting up each room with intubation and chest tube trays. Mollie, have Jordan page me as soon as we know the number of patients we're getting. I will when she gets back. She's not back yet? Not yet. Mr. Ragosa? Security's on the line for you. Woman : Let's go! Let's go! We have a lot of victims! [speaks indistinctly] Yes? Okay. Uh, put it on the E.R. monitor. Woman : Come on, people! Let's move it! Make sure we have plenty of burn kits, people! Man : On it! Son of a bitch. Yes, this Michael Ragosa, San Antonio Memorial. I need to call in a hostage situation. [flatlining continues] [breathing heavily] [lowered voice] This guy is dead. [lowered voice] How are we gonna get out of this? [lowered voice] Jordan look at me. Jordan, look at me. We need him to think he's alive. We gotta trick him. Hey! Is he dead? 'Cause he looks dead. No. He's not dead. No? Then why's that thing still beeping? Huh? And why you pumping his chest? It means he's got no pulse. Do you think I'm stupid? T.C. : We're working it out. We just need to get the blood up to his brain, And then we can fix him and wake him up. But I need that bag over there. Get me the bag if you want him to talk. [flatlining continues] Milo : All right. This red one? T.C. : Yeah. Here's your bag. Ah, shoot. Whoops. I-I'll get it. I'll... You got this? Just calm down everybody. Okay? Topher, keep going with the compressions. I think we stopped the bleeders. [monitor resumes beeping] Topher : Hey! Hey! It's working. We... we stemmed the bleeding. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. But he's still not talking. He'll talk. I need some time. I don't have time. Okay, I need to clamp off the aorta to get the blood up to his brain. That will wake him up for a few minutes, and then you can talk to him. Right. We got the heart beating. It'll work. I've seen it done before. Okay. All right, you have five more minutes. That's it. Perfect. [monitor beeping erratically] Ambulances are two minutes out, people! [indistinct conversations] [lowered voice] Hey. What the hell is going on? [lowered voice] T.C., Topher, and Jordan are in a hostage situation. What? Listen. I need you to step up. Scott is on his way in, and we have a lot of victims en route, so right now, it is on you. Okay? Uh... [snaps fingers] Krista, Paul, here. You're in Trauma 3. You're in Trauma 4. Whatever comes in, you assist on. You're gonna see some scary things tonight. Know the patient is always more scared than you. Got it. I'm ready. Go. Jocelyn, you're gonna be in 2 with me. Landry, can you help with intake and assist 'em with triage? Whatever you need. And, Drew, you got this. Thanks. Woman over radio : 10-4. Man over radio : [speaks indistinctly] Ragosa : Commander. There are three doctors and one technician in the radiology suite. And this is the man who I think may have them. My men are ready to clear this area. We're gonna have to shut down this hospital. Uh, we can't do that. There's a huge chemical fire. You can shut down the second floor, but the E.R. can't close. But that's not safe. [sirens wailing] We're the only trauma center in ten counties. Victims are coming here. You gotta figure something else out. All right. Second floor. Show us. [sirens continue wailing] Around the corner, up the elevator. I'll be right up. Man over radio : [speaks indistinctly] Woman over radio : 10-4. I think you gotta tell people what's going on. [indistinct conversations] Okay. Oh, man. Uh... I'm not going to lie to you. There is a possible hostage situation with T.C., Topher, and Jordan. Woman : [gasps] Man : What? The S.W.A.T. team is here to take care of it. Man : They gonna be okay? Okay, okay. Now just... just listen to me. No matter what you are feeling. No matter how much we are worried about them, we have a job to do. I know it's hard, but everybody is depending on us. So let's focus, dig deep, and treat these people like we would our own families. Okay? Let's go! Man : I got two burn patients with 40% to 50% second and third-degree burns, and there's more on the way, guys. Trauma 3 and Trauma 4. All right, let's do this, people! We're on! Mollie, set up triage. Trauma 4. All the way down. Mollie : I need two nurses in the ambulance bay now. [radio chatter] Mr. Ragosa, I need you to evacuate this area. It's almost go time. We have eyes on the subject. [radio chatter] Nothing's happening until you review the plan with me. Those are my guys in there. And I need a medical team standing by. Okay, we're starting with flash bangs. What about my team? We'll do everything we can to keep them safe. Yeah. Yeah. Listen... He's not gonna make it. I just wanna get the hell out of here. All right? So have a car ready for me. He's gonna figure out this guy's dead any minute. Ragosa has to know something's going on. And if he does, we're in here. So just be ready. What does that mean? We can't just stand here. He killed Dwayne. He's not gonna let us go. Okay, listen up. Change of plans. You are coming with me. Come on. Come on. Take me. Come on, missy! Come on! Now. Okay. Okay. [knock on door] Man : Come on, Dwayne! Stop hogging the M.R.I. machine! What the hell's that?
