 All right, Mayweather. Where'd you learn to punch like that? 
 Golden Gloves, from 8 to 18. 
 Kenny : Y'all need to come chew on some of this iron. 
 Get some grown-man muscles, not those "Body by Jake Cardio-Kickboxing" bodies y'all working with. 
 Yeah, is that right? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Oh, that's funny. 
 See, now, look, I don't mess with none of that Zumba/pilates/spin B.S. 
 This is a grown-ass-man workout. 
 And for real, I'm gonna start charging y'all for this. 
 People should have to pay to see this. 
 Yeah, I-I think you're right. 
 Smart move. 
 Get him! 
 Let's get him to the break room! 
 Did you tell T.C. You wanted to move? 
 Yeah, but you know T.C. I mean, he's not a real planner. 
 He's more "go with the flow." 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 So... what is this? 
 I... [laughs] 
 [Dance music plays] 
 Give me my shorts. 
 Ladies, ladies, ladies. 
 Kenny says we got to pay to display, so this one's on me. 
 Give me my shorts! 
 Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah! 
 What, do you mean these? 
 Give... give me ...I will kill you. 
 Nice grown-ass-man muscles. 
 I really... 
 Give me, give me my friggin' shorts! 
 Tee, strike a pose. 
 Ha ha ha. 
 [Women cheering] 
 If H.R. asks, I was not here. 
 Not a word. 
 So, uh, you want to get a better look? 
 I'm good. Nothing I haven't seen. 
 Give me my friggin' shorts... 
 Oh, you naughty girl. 
 I didn't mean to. It just got heated, Uh-huh. and... 
 Uh-huh. 
 ...I hadn't had any in like a year. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, I'm gonna get you! 
 I kind of wish I hadn't, though, 
 'cause I don't want him to see me as just a hookup, you know? 
 No! Come on, you're just gonna... 
 Oh, hey, Krista. 
 Hey, Jordan. Gwen. 
 Hey, what's up, Krista? 
 Hey! 
 Not much. 
 Huh. Wow. Did she hear that? 
 I'm glad everybody's having a good time. 
 Oh! That's right. 
 Mollie : Hey, guys? 
 Shift starts in five minutes. 
We already have incoming. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Oh-oh-oh. 
 Give-to-me, oh... 
 Oh! Mm-hm. 
 Hey. What's your name, sir? 
 Christian Boone. Call me Boone. I'm just having a little trouble breathing. 
 All right. Well, we're gonna take good care of you. 
 Why don't you hop on over here? 
 Yeah. 
 You having any chest pain? 
 Yeah, a little. 
 All right, we'll run a few tests and see what's going on with you. 
 Mollie, can we get a blood panel, CBC, and an EKG? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Thank you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Laughs] 
 You gonna post those? 
 You know I am. 
 I love this phone... takes amazing pictures. 
 I got my daughter the same one as a reward for getting straight Aâs last semester. 
 Lucky you. 
 My son's favorite subjects are lunch and recess. 
 I don't see a scholarship in our future. 
 Or a phone in his. 
 Topher? 
 You've got a call. 
 Michael, you need parenting advice, you know where to find me. Father of the year. 
 Thanks, jocelyn. 
 Secret texts to a new girlfriend? 
 Oh, uh, no. 
 The... the father of my patient that just passed... Oren. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 That was the radiation guy, right? 
 Yeah. 
 He was so sweet. 
 Yeah. 
 Anyways, that's the, uh, that's the job, right? 
 Have to move on. 
 Still doesn't make it easy. 
 So, you ready for your surgical rotation? 
 [Chuckles] Yeah, yeah. 
 Been, uh, been studying hard. 
 Have to keep up the family name, so my dad says. 
 Scott says your dad's already called three times to find out what you're doing. 
 Yeah, it'll be 20 before the week's over. 
 Good luck following the last surgical intern, 'cause I hear she pretty much killed it. 
 Oh, oh, you mean the one that made out with her attending, right? 
 That... that one. 
 Hmm. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 When's that gonna die? 
 Attention, everybody! 
 I just got off the phone with dispatch. 
 We have a building collapse downtown. 
 We are gonna be the major receiving. 
 Estimated number of casualties? 
 Up to 50. 
 They're requesting that E.R. personnel get triage up and running on-site. 
 I'm on it. Drew, you're with me. 
 Anyone wants a ride, train leaves now. 
 Okay, Boone. Uh... 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Well, the good news is, it's not an acute heart attack. 
 [Sighs] 
 But here's the thing. 
 Oh. There's always a thing. 
 Yeah. 
 There could be some underlying heart disease. 
 And I'm concerned about your symptoms. 
 You fainted, so we need to find out why. 
 Have you been under any stress lately? 
 [Scoffs] Who isn't under stress these days? 
 Right, right. 
 Look, I want to keep you here overnight for observation. 
 Better to be safe than sorry. 
 Doctor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's been an explosion in Southtown. 
 It's a mass casualty. 
 Southtown? 
 That's where my diner is. 
 I have to go. My goddaughter works there. 
 No, no you don't. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 You need to stay here and rest. 
 No, I have to find out if she's okay. 
 Sir, you couldn't get downtown if you tried. It's been zoned off, okay? 
 Well, th-then I have to call her. 
 Just relax. 
 Of course. We understand. Okay, look. 
 If you start to feel funny, you tell Nurse Mollie, I'll come back and check on you, okay? 
 You've got your phone? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. Thank you, Mollie. 
 Yeah. 
 Topher. Hey. Where are we? 
 I've talked to all departments. 
 We've activated disaster protocol. 
 Scott and Paul are prepping O.R.S. 
 I pulled the disaster kits. 
 All right. Triage everyone. Red tag... critical, yellow... urgent, green... walking wounded, black... D.O.A. 
 Got it. 
 You know what? I'll help you prep. 
 Yes, thank you! 
 Kenny! How's that waiting room looking? 
 Cleared and ready for the walking wounded. 
 Grabbed all the O-neg I could get my hands on. 
 We're gonna need more than that. 
 Everybody, be on your toes! It's gonna be messy. 
 Joce, did you get T.C.? 
 Yeah. He just arrived on-site. 
 Tee, tell me something good. 
 If I did, I'd be lying to you, brother. 
 How bad are we talking? 
 It's gonna be a long night. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Let's roll him on three. 
 T.C. : One, two, three. 
 Rigid abdomen. BP 90 systolic, pulse 120. 
 I'm worried about a hot belly. 
 I saw him. He saved me. 
 Who saved you, sir? 
 My guardian angel. He's as big as an ox. 
 He saved me, pulled me from death. 
 I hear you. I hear you. 
Let's get him out of here. 
 An intra-abdominal bleed. 
 Let's red-tag him for a straight shot to the O.R. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. Gwennie, what do we got? 
 Male in his 20s. 
 14-centimeter full-thickness laceration to his left forearm. 
 He's lost a lot of blood. 
 Somebody used a belt as a tourniquet. 
 You didn't do that? 
 No, it wasn't me. 
 It'll probably save his life. 
 Hey, take a look at his forehead. What is that, a cross? 
 No, it's not a cross. It's a "t." 
 Writing a "t" in a patient's blood is military shorthand for "tourniquet." 
 We got us a medic out here. 
 Drew : Hey, Tee! 
 Yeah? 
 Go on. I got this. 
 All right. 
 I got a closed mid-shaft tibia fracture. 
 I started two large-bore I.V.s of LR wide open, going to titrate morphine for pain of three. 
 Nice splint, Drew. 
 It was on him when I got here. 
 Someone's getting to the injured faster than we are. 
 Think I have a good idea who that might be. 
 Guy with the hat. 
 Got it! 
 All right. Let's get a dressing on it, okay? 
 Okay. 
 How many suture packs have you gone through tonight? 
 I stopped counting at 50. 
 At this pace, we're gonna run out of those and blood. 
 I got Ragosa starting a blood bank. 
 I'll have him replenish the other supplies, too. 
 8 red tags, 13 yellow. A dozen green. We've had two D.O.A.s. 
 All surgery teams upstairs are working, but every department's getting buried. 
 And lots of families for missing people. 
 Hey-hey, Kenny, we need you to run point and get an accurate count of the missing. 
 Got it. 
 All right, I'm gonna check on my heart patient. 
 Page me for the next trauma. 
 Keep digging in, people. 
 Oh hey, guys. I got this. 
 Did you hear about my guardian angel? 
 He carried me out. 
 I'm... I'm gonna have to wait for the movie, sir. 
 Hey, Paul. 
 Your next surgery. 
 Julian : Paul! 
 Paul : Dad? What are you... what are you doing here? 
 Hello, Paul. 
 I told you not to come, Dad. 
 This is my first night of surgery. 
 Nonsense. That's exactly why I did come. 
 You think I'd miss your first night? 
 Dr. Cummings. Huge honor. 
 I'm Dr. Zia, Paul's attending and night-shift chief. 
 Oh, of course. 
 I-I was in Austin giving a lecture. 
 Decided I'd swing by. 
 On any other night, we would roll out the red carpet. 
 But as you can see... 
 I-I understand. 
 I'll just make myself busy down here. 
 Paul, I'll talk to you later. 
 Don't let me down. 
 T.C. : He's good. I've already checked him. 
 Set another I.V. on the way in. Come on, let's go. 
 [Coughing] 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Thanks, guys. I've got it from here. 
 What do we got there? 
 Just wrapping a broken wrist. 
 What's your name? 
 Bennett. James Bennett. 
 I was nearby. 
 I heard an explosion, came over to see what happened. 
 So you pulled an old man out of the rubble? 
 Tourniquet on an arm? 
 Splint another man's leg. 
 Oh, man, I'm sorry if I overstepped. 
 I was just trying to help out. 
 Don't apologize. Army medic, right? 
 Yes, sir... two tours in Afghanistan. 
 Looks like it's our lucky night. 
 You're an off-duty paramedic? 
 I'm not a paramedic. I wish I was, though. 
 I just can't get on any of the crews. 
 How long you been trying? 
 More than a year. 
 They said I had to take an EMT course, but, you know, that's 10 grand for a cheap one. I don't have that. 
 They won't transfer over your medic service? 
 Guy like you would be an asset to them. 
 You've done this stuff under fire. 
 Uh, yes, sir. They said I had to start over. 
 I don't mind. I'll do whatever it takes. I just don't have the cash. 
 Man : Hey, Doc! We got another one! 
 Hey, look. Your service counts with us, all right? 
 We're a little shorthanded tonight. 
 Do you mind sticking around, helping out? 
 Of course. Anything. 
 Yeah yeah, see all those green tags over there? Start treating the walking wounded. 
 You're gonna be all right. 
They're gonna take care of you. 
 Over here. 
 Look, there's a battle sign, anisocoria. 
Left pupil bigger than the right... 
 Bring her to Gwen. Tell Gwen to bring her straight to Jordan. 
 Possible TBI to the basilar skull fracture. 
 Man : Got it. 
 You're still a bit tachycardic. 
 My goddaughter still hasn't answered her phone. 
 I'm sure she's fine. 
 But you do need to try to relax as much as possible. 
 I will be back soon to check on you. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. Excuse me. 
 So, if you're wondering, 
 "is that world-renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Julian Cummings working triage in my E.R.?"... your eyes do not deceive you. 
 Come on... did he come here to watch Paul on his first night of surgery? 
 Talk about putting pressure on the kid. 
 Night like this, I'll take all the help we can get. 
 Yeah. 
 Scott : This gentleman kept talking about his guardian angel before we put him under. 
 I'm starting to think he might just actually have one. 
 Okay. 
 Removing the perforated ischemic intestine. 
 Paul, tie off that blood vessel for me. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 One-handed? 
 I'll have to tell your dad about that... assuming he's the one who taught you. 
 Yeah, well, some dads teach their sons to play catch. 
 Others teach their sons to tie surgical knots. 
 Guess which one I had. 
 Gwen : Incoming! 
 Jordan? 
 Female, 20s. Red-tag head trauma. 
 T.C. said possible traumatic brain injury and basilar skull fracture. 
 She's been in and out of consciousness on the ride over. 
 What's your name, sweetie? 
 Alex. 
 Okay, Alex. You stay with me, okay? 
 That's her! That's my goddaughter! 
 Oh, my God! Alex! 
 Sir, you can't be in here. 
 Alex! Alex! Alex! 
 It's okay. He's my patient. 
 He can talk to her from there. 
 All right. 
 On three. One, two, three. 
 Alex : Uncle Boone? 
 Boone : Yeah. 
 Is that you? 
 It's me, sweetie. 
 I'm here for you. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Jordan : BP's falling. 
 I need a chem panel and a CBC. Cross and type. 
 I was so worried about you. 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God. Where are you? What's happening? 
 Alex? 
 Talk to me. What's going on? 
 I can't... I can't see anything. 
 Talk to me. Talk to me. 
 I can't see. I can't see! 
 Do something! 
 Uncle, help me! 
 Alex! 
 Get him out! 
 Let me help her! 
 We're gonna take care of her, all right? 
 Alex. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Okay, Alex. We're gonna figure out what's going on. 
 Kenny here is gonna take you to C.T., all right? 
 Kenny : I'm right here, Alex. 
 Look, I'll be with you the whole way. 
 Just say my name if you need anything, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Uncle Boone, are you there? 
 I'm right here, baby. 
 I'm scared. 
 You let them take you, okay? 
 They're gonna fix you up real good. 
 Priority to C.T. scan. There could be bleeding in her occipital lobe. 
 Ah, front of the line we go. 
 Bennett : I got no pulse! 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 He's got a pulse now. 
 Yeah, I saw he had a pacemaker, so I went to do a... 
 Precordial thump? 
 Yeah. Good call. 
 All right, 50s, male. 
 Red tag to the E.R. 
 Drew : Forget paramedic. 
You should be a doctor. 
 Thanks, but I'll stay with the action. 
 I like being the first guy to help people. 
 It's the one thing I'm really good at. 
 Well, if you got one skill, that's a damn good one to have. 
 Man : Yellow Tag, Doc. 
 All right. You got this? 
 Okay, yeah. 
 Adrenaline's tough to replace, huh? 
 I was a medic in Iraq. 
 Don't know what I'd be doing if I wasn't a doctor. 
 Geez, how'd you go from being a field medic to a doc? 
 Somewhere along the way, I just caught a lucky break. 
 You're like an army commercial. [Chuckles] 
 You know, they make it seem like you serve and you're set for life. 
 I still wouldn't trade it for anything, though. 
 Please tell me it's not like this every night at this hospital. 
 Well, uh, no. Mass casualty's actually pretty rare, Dad. 
 I'm talking about the quality of facilities, the protocol, the inefficiencies... 
 Look, can we... can we talk later? Okay? 
I need to get this patient to surgery. 
 Paul, look. This is simple triage. 
 You want the most critical patient. 
This is your patient. 
 Look, I'm just trying to follow Dr. Clemmens' orders. 
 Then Dr. Clemmens is wrong. 
 Paul, what's the holdup? I need my patient in surgery. 
 Right, um, my father and I are having a minor difference of opinion as to whom we should bring up to surgery. 
 You got to be kidding me. Dr. 
Cummings, I'm Dr. Clemmens. 
 This patient is your next surgery. 
 She was incorrectly yellow-tagged. 
 Her crush injury is now presenting as a distended abdomen. 
 Consider ruptured viscus or hemoperitoneum. 
 He's right. Paul, let's prep this patient for surgery. 
 Thank you for your input, Dr. Cummings. 
 I-I-I would like to observe. 
 How 'bout I sit in on this one? 
 You know what, it's Paul's first night in surgery, so I don't think it's... scrubs are right in there. 
 Fantastic. 
 You didn't have to say yes. 
 Yeah, I did. He's relentless. 
 He would have found his way into that O.R. eventually. 
 Hey, you. Crazy night, huh? 
 One for the books. 
 I-is Alex done with her scan? 
 Uh, she'll be back in five. 
 Is this how it's gonna be between us now? 
 I've got work to do. I'm sure you do, too. 
 Michael. Walk with me. 
 How are we on blood? 
 Ah good... we just got a new shipment in from the blood drive at Lackland. 
 Should take us through the night. 
 Great. I.C.U. just freed up some beds. 
Let's get some patients up there ASAP. 
 [Upbeat piano music plays] 
 You a fan of grumpy cat? 
 [Laughs] Make me laugh every time. 
 No, it's, uh... when my daughter and I got our new phones, we somehow got stuck sharing the same cloud, so now I'm getting her texts every five seconds. 
 I've just got to ask them to disconnect it. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second. 
 Sharing that cloud gives you complete insight into her world. 
 Aw... 
 That's like a gift from the gods. 
 Make sure she's not doing anything, you know... 
 Unsavory. 
 Anyway [Sighs] heading to the I.C.U. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Oh, Doc. Thank God. Her vision came back. 
 I thought it would be good if he hung out with Alex. 
 It keeps them both calmer. 
 That was a great idea. 
 I'm just gonna get in there and take a look. 
 You have any blurriness? 
 Just a little. 
 Thought my painting career was over before it started. 
 Jordan : I can imagine. Well, your C.T. came back and there's no acute bleeding, but we're still gonna have ophthalmology and neurology take a look. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Aside from the bumps and bruises, I feel okay. 
 That's good. 
 Have they figured out why the building blew up? 
 Alex, please. You need to rest. 
Let the doctor go do her job. 
 No it's okay. It's just early reports are saying it's a gas-line leak. 
 Oh, no. 
 What's the matter? 
 I was working late at the diner, and I can't remember if I turned off the pilot light. 
 Alex, it's not your fault, honey. It couldn't be. 
 Um... Somebody want to catch me up here? 
 My diner is on the ground level of the same building that was damaged. 
 When we close up in the evenings, it's Alex's job to turn off the pilot light for the stove and water heater. 
 And I couldn't remember if I did, so I got dressed and headed back to the diner to check. 
 But just as I went inside... 
 Alex, I'm sure that your Uncle is right. 
I mean, have you ever forgotten before? 
 No. No, it's just I... 
 I just... I ca... I ca... can't remember. 
 Jordan : Alex? 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 BP's 220 systolic. 
 What does that mean? 
What does that... Alex! 
 What does that mean? Alex? 
 Weak on the right side. 
 All right, start a nitro drip. She's having a stroke. 
 [Gasping] 
 Boone, you're hyperventilating. 
 Try to breathe like me. 
 Oh, God! 
 Try to breathe like me. 
 Oh, God! Oh, God! 
 Oh my God. 
 There's no pulse. 
 All right. His heart's failing. Grab a crash cart. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 The last of the red and yellow tags have been moved to E.R.s. 
 We got a few green tags, but I think everyone's been treated. 
 Okay, great. Let's pack it up. 
 Where's Gwen and Drew? 
 They were doing last looks with Bennett. 
 [Explosion] 
 T.C. : All right, everybody. 
 We are looking for that big army medic. 
 Drew, are you sure you and Gwen saw him come in here? 
 Drew : A guy that size is kind of hard to miss. 
 I saw him run into the building after the second explosion. 
 [Muffled explosion] 
 Gwen : That's not good. 
 I'm not leaving till I find him! 
 Bennett! 
 Bennett?! 
 Bennett! Can you hear us? 
 Over here! Over here! 
 Bennett! We're here! 
 Drew : Let's get this stuff off him. 
 Can you guys move him? 
 Watch that. 
 Be really careful. 
 Okay, I'll support the torso. 
 Pull on three. 
 Ready? 
 Tee, his arm's been severed. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 We got to move him now. 
 Okay. And now to reduce the compartment pressure. 
 10 blade to our intern. 
 Seriously? 
 Never do it, never learn. 
 You're up, Paul. 
 You mean an 11 blade, right, Dr. Clemmens? 
 Well, I said 10. I meant 10. 
 We all have our preferences. 
 Well, it's not a preference. 
 There's a right way and a wrong way. 
 11 gives you a more precise cut and less tissue trauma. 
 I know what an 11 blade does, but we don't have time to be cute or fancy. 
 This is a fasciotomy to reduce the compartment pressure. 
 This isn't neurosurgery. 
 [Scoffs] That's for sure. 
 [Sighs] 
 10 blade to our intern, please. 
 Paul, use the 11 blade. 
 Dr. Cummings, I understand that you are used to running the show, but you are in my O.R., and I cannot have you compromising my team. 
 You will either have to let us do our work or step out. 
 Fine. I'll step out. 
 Just drives me crazy to see things done the wrong way. 
 [Sighs] 
 You've had to put up with that your whole life, huh? 
 I came out here to get out from under his shadow. 
 I guess Texas wasn't far enough. 
 
 
 
 T.C. : James Bennett, 23. 
 Building collapse caused transhumeral amputation to the left arm. 
 Hypotensive and tachycardic. 
 Mollie, prep this arm for re-attachment. 
 My hand's burning. Just give me something for it. I'll be okay. 
 Take it easy, there, Bennett. 
 Give me two migs of Ativan and push another 10 of morphine. 
 And, uh, Jocelyn, get me two units of O-neg and set up for a central line. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy. 
 [Grunts] 
 Oh! Get... hey! 
 I'm going back out there! 
 He can shoot me if he wants me to stay! 
 No one's gonna shoot you, okay? 
 We're gonna take care of you. 
 It's all going to be okay. 
 All right. 
 There we go. 
 Jocelyn, can you call up to surgery and make sure there's an O.R. free for arm re-attachment? 
 Do it now. 
 Jocelyn : Right away. 
 Okay. You okay? You took quite a shot. 
 I'm good. I've been hit harder than that before. 
 On three. One, two, three. 
 He's in heart failure. 
There's fluid in his lungs. 
 Did we miss a heart attack? 
 No, his second troponin is normal. 
 It's more complicated than that. 
 He needs an echocardiogram. 
 Yeah. 
 Alex's MRI is back. 
 Topher : Whoa. Look at this. 
 Things just got more complicated for Alex. 
 Yeah. It's not good. 
 Krista, stay here and watch Boone. 
 I'll be upstairs getting a surgical consult. 
 Okay. 
 Excuse me. 
 Alex has a carotid dissection that has sent blood clots to her brain. 
 Well, that would explain the loss of vision and then the stroke. 
 Exactly. 
 In a few hours, the damage from the stroke will be permanent, and a large section of her brain will die. 
 [Sighs] 
 But there is a Hail Mary. 
 A-a mechanical embolectomy. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We retrieve the clots from her brain using a catheter. 
 But we'll be hard-pressed getting an interventionalist to the hospital at this hour. 
 Yeah, well, the thing is, we already have one. 
 Paul's dad. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I've already called the hospital for privileges, and they're sending over authorization for the procedure now. 
 [Sighs] 
 I-I'd like you to ask him. 
 I figure he'd respect you more, you know? Surgeon to surgeon. 
 Yeah. 
 Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate it. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Limb re-attachment in the E.R.? I don't know. 
 What's the wait on surgery and vascular? 
 Backed up for hours. 
 Bennett doesn't have hours, okay? He'll lose the arm. 
 I don't know his full story, but he's not had it easy since post-deployment. So... 
 So you got to let us try. Okay, he's a soldier. He's one of us. 
 He was out there saving people and got hurt. 
 I-I get what's at stake. 
I want you guys to do it. 
 But if we get swamped again, I can't have you two siphoned off for the rest of the night while other people die. 
 Mollie. 
 Yes? 
 How we looking on mass casualty admits? 
 I haven't had one in a while. 
They say the area's all clear. 
 There you go. 
 Okay, okay. Do it. 
 But we get busy, I'm gonna pull you off. 
 We can't trade a life for an arm. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Krista : It wasn't a heart attack. 
 Jordan : No. 
 How did his heart get so dilated? 
 He mentioned that he was under a lot of pressure earlier this evening. 
 It could be the severe stressor that weakened his heart, causing dilation. 
 Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 
 Broken-heart syndrome? 
 That's what it looks like. 
 He's gonna need a heart transplant... or, at the very least, an LVAD. 
 We'll let him know what his options are when he wakes up. 
 But for now, we should keep an eye on Alex's surgery. 
 He'll want to know how she's doing. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 All right, bud. 
 And we've just received hospital privileges for you to perform the surgery. 
 Of course you did. 
 So, um, Dr. Clemmens, you'll allow me to use your O.R.? 
 And perhaps an 11 blade? 
 Look, I'm sorry if you felt that I was... 
 Tactless. Disrespectful. Rude... 
 Dad! 
 Dad. 
 You're the only one capable of the procedure that will save her life. 
 Okay? So, please, just... just do it. 
 Fine. I'll perform the procedure. 
 Under two conditions. 
 One, Dr. Clemmens, you stay out of my O.R. 
 And two, I need Paul to assist me. 
 It's his first night on surgery. 
 It's not mine. 
 Paul, scrub in. 
 We can finally have that talk you've been avoiding. 
 And we are steering the catheter up to the blood clot in her brain. 
 Opening the basket and grabbing the clot. 
 Watch this, Paul. 
 And just like that... 
 [Syringe pops] 
 ...adios, clot. 
 That's really cool. 
 Oh, finally. 
 You think your old man's cool. 
 I've always thought that, Dad. 
 Well, I find that hard to believe. 
 You could've gone to my Alma Mater or my med school or joined our practice after your residency. 
 I said I admired you. I didn't say I want to be you. 
 Can we do this later, please? 
 Well, it's the only time I get to see you. 
 Every time I call, you're either too busy or too tired or whatever else you make up to get me off the phone. 
 So, let's talk about what it's gonna take for you to accept a surgical residency to Johns Hopkins. 
 It's time for you to go big or go home. 
 So, what was your lucky break? 
 That's a long story. 
 We're re-attaching an arm. We got time. 
 Touché. 
 You ever drive a '64 GTO? 
 No. That the car you had growing up? 
 Oh, hell no. I was broke. 
 But Thad and I, we drove one one time. 
 Man, driving that car was a real come-to-Jesus moment. 
 W-wait. So... 
 Wait, did you and your bro steal a car? 
 Oh, well, we were gonna return it. 
 We used to go down to Camden Yards and "borrow" cars during games. 
 We got about five blocks before we got busted. 
 Morning of the hearing, we're on our way to the courthouse, and the energy felt wrong. 
 So we look around, and everyone's eyes are on the TVs. 
 And what was going on? What was on it? 
 Well, we got there just in time to see the second plane crash into the world trade center. 
 So we just sat there and we watched, stunned. 
 And, you know, just, uh... 
 Made all the crap we were doing just seem so childish. 
 So we went up to the judge and we said, 
 "Hey, if you let us off, we will go straight down to the recruiting office, sign up for the army, go kick some serious ass for the U.S.A." 
 Some break. 
 Yeah. 
 I told you... boosting that car was a serious come-to-Jesus moment. 
 So the army put me through med school. 
 Without that, who knows where I'd be? 
 Probably in prison, getting traded for a pack of cigarettes. 
 I'm worth at least a carton. 
 Whatever you say, Doc. 
 I can't... - I can't give you a decision. 
 Well, you're gonna have to. 
 They're not gonna hold that residency for you forever. 
 I didn't ask you to get me one. And if I wanted one, Dad, I would've gotten one myself, all right? 
 Maybe. It's very competitive. 
 People would kill for this opportunity. But you didn't even try. 
 That tells me you were afraid. 
 I wa... no, I wasn't afraid, okay? 
 I didn't want to go there. 
 Well, sometimes a father can see what's best for their child even if they can't. 
 Hey. 
 Just checking in to see how Alex's procedure went. 
 How do you think it went? 
 Paul, we'll talk about this later. 
 I need to make sure your, uh, staff can properly take care of my patient. 
 Come on. Let's take a walk. 
 Please tell me we're done, Gwen. 
 We've been given the all-clear. 
 No more casualties headed this way. 
 Finally! 
 Yeah, it's been a hell of a night. 
 Oh, hey. 
 You were right with your advice about my daughter's phone. 
 Check this out. 
 I mean, don't check it out. 
 Whoa. 
 That is a very skimpy bathing suit. 
 I didn't even know she had that. 
 I did not get her that phone to be sexting. 
 I thought she was a nerd. 
 I mean, I-I want her to be a nerd. 
 [Cellphone vibrates] Kids are what they are, you know? 
 Holy sh... she just said, "my dad works all night. 
 He won't know if we hook up." 
 She... she is... she is grounded forever. 
 That text is going to be her last on that phone. 
 Wait. 
 Hold on. Keep your cool. 
 Don't blow your cover. 
 Blow my cover? 
 This isn't "The Departed". 
 This is my daughter we're talking about. 
 No, no. Look. 
 When the Brits cracked the Nazi code in World War II, they waited to get more information, right? 
 I don't care about that. 
 Some punk named sexyman916 is sexting with my daughter. 
 Okay. Blow your cover. 
 And you'll never know what she's up to again, okay? 
 Now, you listen to me. 
 You have Janet make sure she's in, and you track this. 
 You don't know what else she's up to. 
 I think I'm gonna be sick. 
 Yeah, well, get used to it. 
 I wish I had something like that to know what Naomi's doing. 
 Trust me... they grow up really fast. 
 I hate technology. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, babe. 
 Haven't seen you all night. 
 So, limb attachment in the E.R. 
 That's pretty exciting stuff. 
 Yeah. Just waiting for it to pink up, see if it worked. 
 So, how you feeling, Mama? 
 You didn't get any sleep this afternoon. 
 I know... that's because every time I close my eyes, there's a million questions just running through my brain. 
 You need to relax. 
 Yeah? 
-Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, I'm trying, but... 
 Okay. 
 Which O.B. Are we going with? 
 Where are we gonna live once the baby gets here? 
 And who's gonna take care of the baby when we're both working a shift? 
 Dr. Newton, my apartment, Topher will schedule us on different shifts. 
 I'm a genius. Problem solved. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, well, I prefer Dr. 
Zeuli over Dr. Newton, uh, your apartment is way too small, and we will never see each other if we work separate shifts. 
 When you put it like that... 
 Mm. 
 Ahh. 
 Jordan, I need you to talk to Boone. He's freaking out. 
 Okay. I'll be right there. 
 Thank God you're cute. 
 I have seen hundreds of surgical residents and E.R. interns do their rotations, and I can tell you, after one day, you're in the top five. 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
 So I get why your father pushes you as hard as he does. 
 I'm sure you are a really good E.R. doc, but you could be an amazing surgeon. 
 It's like when Jordan left the Bulls to go play baseball. 
 It just... it just felt like such a waste. 
 Yeah, but that was his first love. 
 He was just following his heart. 
 Okay. 
 So, what's in your heart? 
 E.R. medicine? 
 No. 
 Then what is? 
 Because if you are just rebelling against your father, then you're cutting your nose off to spite your face. 
 If you want to be a surgeon, be one. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Boone, you do understand that if you refuse the medical advice that I'm giving you, your chance of survival is close to zero? 
 Yes, I understand. 
 Yes, I want to die. 
 Where is this coming from? 
 What about Alex? 
 She's gonna need you now more than ever. 
 Okay, look, I... I realize that a heart transplant is a scary proposal... 
 It's not that. 
 The heart should go to someone else. 
 Why would you s... because. 
 [Sobs softly] 
 [Voice breaking] I caused that explosion that made that building collapse. 
 Can't believe it. 
 Hey. What's wrong? 
 Our... our first patient of the shift, Boone, the whole mass casualty was his fault. 
 He just confessed to me that he was bankrupt, so he intentionally set fire to his diner to collect the insurance money. 
 He thought it was contained. 
 And now he may have injured or killed all of those people, not to mention his goddaughter. 
 Has he been read his rights? 
 The police are on their way, but for now, he's our patient, and... We just have to keep him alive. 
 Except he's refusing medical treatment. 
 He just wants to die. 
 Yeah, I don't think he's gonna get off that lucky. 
 He's devastated about what he did. 
 Especially how it's gonna affect Alex. He can't even face her. 
 Oh, man. 
 I have to tell her before the police get here. 
 Good luck. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah. 
 Good times. 
 So, they're taking this thing off? 
 I was just starting to like it. 
 It's kind of a cool look. [Laughs] 
 Well, listen, with some time and healing and a good amount of physical therapy, you're gonna be ready to work. 
 Work? [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, that's... that's very funny, Doc. 
 Well, actually, we did some digging in the V.A. 
 They got a new program that credits army medic service and gets guys like you jobs in V.A. Emergency Centers. 
 It's called an Intermediate Care Technician. You train as you get paid. 
 In 13 months, you're gonna be fully certified to work in any hospital in the country. 
 I had no idea. I thought the V.A. sucked. 
 Well, nah. They do some good things there, too. 
 Don't paint them all bad. 
 So, there's a slot waiting for you. 
 You start class in a couple of weeks, and then you earn while you learn. 
 [Voice breaking] I'm sorry. 
 I don't mean to be a big baby about this. 
 Um... 
 Just, nobody's ever, uh... 
 Why are you guys doing this for me? 
 I'm nobody. 
 You're not a nobody. 
 Everybody needs a break. This one's yours. 
 Yeah. 
 So don't screw it up. 
 Of course not. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Sorry. 
 Be careful. 
 Let's let the surgery team finish this up. 
 It's him. My guardian angel. 
 That's one nice-sized angel. 
 Glad you got your wing fixed. 
 He was my only family. 
 I can't believe he did this. 
 Was it to help pay for my school? 
 No. 
 It had nothing to do with you. 
 He got into money trouble for a lot of reasons, and a good man made a bad decision. 
 I think... I think it's best you try and remember all the good he did for you. 
 I don't know if I'll be able to. 
 Could you if you were me? 
 I don't know. 
 My father did some pretty stupid things, but lately, I find myself remembering all the fun we had. 
 You know, hiking in the woods and, uh, homemade ice cream. 
 I think it's important to remember those things. 
 I already miss him so much. 
 I know you do, sweetie. 
 I know. 
 [Crying] 
 [Sniffles] 
 You were right. 
 Surgery is in my blood. 
 I'm good at it. 
 You're very good at it. 
 And... I think I might want to pursue it. 
 [Chuckles] Finally. 
 You have no idea how happy that makes me. 
 I'll call Dr. Nelson at Hopkins and secure your spot. 
 I didn't say "Hopkins." 
 I don't understand. You said you want to go into surgery. 
 And I do... but on my own terms. 
 And not just surgery ...pediatric surgery. 
 Pediatrics? 
 Yeah. 
 The drunks, the GSWs ...I can do that. 
 But I like working with kids. 
 And, you know, I'm good at it. 
 Okay, that's a very tough discipline. 
 And Johns Hopkins only has one slot. 
 I don't know if I can swing... you don't... you don't have to. 
 I've already secured a slot. 
 We're going to start a pediatric surgical fellowship here next year. 
 Paul will finish up his internship and then move into a dual pediatric and surgical E.R. residency. 
 W... that's an awfully big bite. 
 You risk being mediocre at both. 
 Or being the best.

Oren, uh, same age as me... he just, uh, passed away last night. 
 And the last thing that he wanted to do before he died was take a fishing trip with his father. 
 He, uh, he never got to make it. 
 That, uh, must have been very tough on his father.

 Busy schedule and all, you know.

 Solid work, Michael. 
 [Cellphone vibrates] Thank you. 
 So, what's the latest in teenage-daughter world? 
 Anything juicy? 
 Uh... Yeah. 
 I got to say, your advice was spot-on. Look at this. 
 She organized a party for tonight while I'm working and Janet's at her mom's with the twins. 
 I think it's time to bring that hammer down. 
 It's time, right? 
 Absolutely. 
 This is gonna be fun, actually. 
 Mm. 
 Sometimes you got to fire a shot across the bow showing Dad is not a pushover. 
 Mm. And like you're always watching. 
 Got to scare them sometimes. 
 Yeah, Lynn. It's Dad. Do not even speak. 
 You're grounded till you're 30. 
 Yes, I can. 
 Why? Because I know about the party. 
 Put your mother on. 
 [Scoffs] She was not happy. 
 Mm. 
 Janet. Yeah. 
 Did you know that our da... 
 What? 
 What?! 
 I-I-I was just t-trying to... 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Yeah, okay, okay, okay. 
 What was that? 
 Well, Michael, apparently, um, my daughter knew that I was spying the whole time. 
 What? How? 
 She's a nerd, like I said. 
 She could tell when I opened her texts. 
 And she told Janet. 
 They're teaching dad a lesson in trust. 
 Sexyman916 is a fake account. 
 Now my daughter and my wife are unhappy with me. 
 It was a good plan. 
 It was a terrible plan. 
 Well, in hindsight. 
 In any sight! 
 Thanks a lot, Michael. Super advice. 
 Can't wait to go home to my own mass casualty. 
 S-so put those over there for me. Thanks. 
 So, any plans for after the shift? 
 You asking? 
 I think I just did. 
 Hey, you don't have to. Just because we... 
 Yes. Yes, we did. 
 And I don't know about you, but I'd like to do it again. 
 But first, I'd like to take you to dinner.
