 Scene: The stairwell. 
 Leonard: So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. 
 Penny: Oh, that’s very interesting. 
 Leonard: It’s also not pink and has no berries. 
 Penny: Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question. 
 Leonard: What was your question again? 
 Penny: Do you want some. 
 Leonard: Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant. 
 Penny: Right. 
 Leonard: So, gas. 
 Penny: Got it. 
 Leonard: Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.) 
 Penny: What are you doing? 
 Leonard: There was a draft. 
 Penny: I didn’t feel a draft. 
 Leonard: Why don’t we just go into your…. 
 Penny: Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little. 
 Leonard: No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast. 
 Penny: No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date. 
 Leonard: Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R. 
 Penny: Or we could just wing it. 
 Leonard: That might work too. 
 Penny: Goodnight Leonard. 
 Leonard: Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.)  
 Cut to inside the apartment. 
 Raj: He’s coming. Screen saver. 
 Howard: Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date? 
 Leonard: Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me? 
 Sheldon: They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. 
 Howard: You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. 
 Leonard: What are you talking about, the date went fine. 
 Raj: Dude, she said she wants to slow things down. 
 Leonard: Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.” 
 Howard: No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.” 
 Raj: You being the fish. 
 Leonard: I’m not the fish. 
 Howard: Oh really, did you make a second date. 
 Leonard: Well, we sort of decided to wing it. 
 Sheldon: Oh, even I know that’s lame. 
 Leonard: Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong. 
 Howard: Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into. 
 Leonard: I didn’t say anything like that. 
 Howard: Good, ‘cos they don’t work. 
 Raj: They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing. 
 Leonard: Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me. 
 Howard: Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest. 
 Raj: Nice close up, by the way. 
 Sheldon: Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. 
 Leonard: That’s not a bad sign. 
 Sheldon: Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. 
 Raj: And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there. 
 Leonard: I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera. 
 Raj: He was a lot more fun when he had no hope. 
 Howard: Give him time. 
 Credits sequence 
 Scene: The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.  
 Penny (entering): Hi. 
 Sheldon: Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates. 
 Penny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once): Thanks. 
 Sheldon: Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? 
 Penny: Sheldon, may I ask you a question? 
 Sheldon: I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it. 
 Penny: Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. 
 Sheldon: Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. 
 Penny: No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac? 
 Sheldon: Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature. 
 Penny: How is that not a braniac? 
 Sheldon: Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. 
 Penny: So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me. 
 Sheldon: That depends. 
 Penny: On what? 
 Sheldon: Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? 
 Penny: No. 
 Sheldon: Do you speak Klingon? 
 Penny: No. 
 Sheldon: Do you know any card tricks? 
 Penny: Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. 
 Sheldon: Why would you lie about that? 
 Penny: Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser. 
 Sheldon: You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? 
 Penny: You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. 
 Sheldon: Yeah, but you were neither. 
 Penny: Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this. 
 Sheldon: You’re asking me to keep a secret? 
 Penny: Yeah. 
 Sheldon: Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. 
 Penny: What? 
 Sheldon: Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself. 
 Penny: Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment. 
 Sheldon: Physiologically impossible. 
 Penny: Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend. 
 Sheldon: So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences? 
 Penny: Well, yeah. 
 Sheldon: Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends? 
 Scene: The stairwell. 
 Sheldon: I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman. 
 Leonard: You could be Batman? 
 Sheldon: Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I’m Batman. See. 
 Penny (arriving): Hi guys. 
 Leonard: Hey. 
 Sheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably): Hi Penny. 
 Leonard: Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie. 
 Penny: Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday. 
 Leonard: What about Saturday? 
 Penny: You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know. 
 Leonard: Great. So you just let me know when you know. So… (she leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong? 
 Sheldon: Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.)  
 Leonard (chasing him): What does that mean? 
 Sheldon: Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists. 
 Leonard: No I didn’t. 
 Sheldon: I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. 
 Leonard: What’s going on with you? 
 Sheldon: Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.)  
 Leonard: What’s wrong with your face? 
 Sheldon: There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard. 
 Leonard: What? 
 Sheldon: I said Good Day! (He leaves) 
 Leonard: Good day? 
 Scene: The Cheesecake Factory 
 Penny: Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day… 
 Sheldon (appearing behind her): You must release me from my oath. 
 Penny: Sheldon, I’m working. 
 Sheldon: Why don’t you take a minute to decide (leads her away)I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit. 
 Penny: Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret? 
 Sheldon: I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me. 
 Penny: Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay? 
 Sheldon: Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday. 
 Penny: Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it. 
 Scene: The apartment. 
 Sheldon (entering): Leonard, I’m moving out. 
 Leonard: What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why? 
 Sheldon: There doesn’t have to be a reason. 
 Leonard: Yeah, there kind of does. 
 Sheldon: Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out. 
 Leonard: I’m still confused. 
 Sheldon: Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler. 
 Howard (entering): Hey, qu’est q’wass up? 
 Raj: We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers. 
 Howard: And some of those skinless chicks were hot. 
 Sheldon: If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack. 
 Howard: That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. 
 Leonard: It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out. 
 Raj: What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television? 
 Leonard: No. 
 Raj: Did you take a band aid off in front of him? 
 Leonard: No. 
 Howard: Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? 
 Raj: Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often? 
 Leonard: No. 
 Howard: Did you make fun of trains? 
 Leonard: I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane. 
 Raj: Well, we all knew this day was coming. 
 Leonard: That was fast. 
 Sheldon: It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor. 
 Leonard: Where are you gonna live? 
 Sheldon: Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends. 
 Howard: Bye (runs out.)  
 Raj: Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment. 
 Sheldon: Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder? 
 Raj: I hate trains. 
 Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains. 
 Raj: Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. (Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.) 
 Leonard: This could work. 
 
 
 
 Scene: Raj’s apartment.  
 Sheldon: This is a very old building. 
 Raj: Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory. 
 Sheldon: Uh-oh. 
 Raj: What? 
 Sheldon: Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials? 
 Raj: Not until now. 
 Sheldon: I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it. 
 Raj: Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon… 
 Sheldon: I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. 
 Raj: Terrific. 
 Sheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television): Is that woman Aishwarya Rai? 
 Raj: Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress. 
 Sheldon: Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit. 
 Raj: How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute. 
 Sheldon: Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema. 
 Scene: Howard’s house. The door rings.  
 Howard: Who is it? 
 Voice: Strippergram. (Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.) 
 Raj: Tag. You’re it. (Runs away.)  
 Howard: Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? 
 Scene: Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor. 
 Sheldon: I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever. 
 Howard: Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench? 
 Sheldon: I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here. 
 Howard: Do you want to switch? 
 Sheldon: No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. 
 Howard: Get out of bed, we’re switching. 
 Sheldon: Now, only if you want to. 
 Howard: Just get in the bed! 
 Howard’s mother (off): What’s going on? Are you boys roughhousing? 
 Howard: We’re just talking ma. 
 Howard’s mother: If you don’t settle down right now, I’m not going to let you have any more sleepovers. 
 Howard: For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a school night! (To Sheldon) Comfy now? 
 Sheldon: Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving. 
 Howard: So don’t look at it. 
 Sheldon: She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman. 
 Howard: No kidding? 
 Sheldon: Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her. 
 Howard: What about Lee Meriwether? 
 Sheldon: Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether. 
 Howard: Well I’m glad that’s settled. 
 Sheldon: That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether… 
 Howard: Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep. 
 Sheldon: I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though. 
 Howard: Oh for God’s sake. 
 Sheldon: But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel…. 
 Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment. There is an urgent rapping at the door. 
 Leonard: I’m coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.) 
 Sheldon: Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud. 
 Leonard: What’s with him? 
 Howard: Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it. 
 Sheldon: I’m ba-ack! 
 Leonard: I still don’t know why you left. 
 Sheldon: I can’t tell you. 
 Leonard: Why not. 
 Sheldon: I promised Penny. 
 Leonard: You promised Penny what? 
 Sheldon: That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh! 
 Leonard: What secret. Tell me the secret. 
 Sheldon: Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad. 
 Leonard: Not that secret, the other secret. 
 Sheldon: I’m Batman. Shhhhh! 
 Leonard: Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret. 
 Sheldon: Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard. 
 Leonard: I promise. 
 Sheldon: Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard. 
 Leonard: So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem? 
 Sheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny. 
 Leonard: Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous. 
 Sheldon: I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows. 
 Scene: The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny’s door. 
 Penny (opening door): Hi. 
 Leonard: Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer. 
 Penny: What are you talking about. 
 Leonard: First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. 
 Penny: He told you? 
 Leonard: Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.)  
 Penny: Pasadena city college? 
 Leonard: A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal. 
 Penny: Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree. 
 Leonard: Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college. 
 Penny: Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you? 
 Leonard: That doesn’t matter to me at all. 
 Penny: So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart. 
 Leonard: Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the camera) Oh bite me!
