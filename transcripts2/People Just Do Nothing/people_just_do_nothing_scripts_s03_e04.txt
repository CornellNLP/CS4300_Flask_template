 OK, everyone? 
  Right, we're going to watch a video on breast-feeding, and hopefully this video's going to make you feel increasingly comfortable about it, so Enjoy. 
  Get off to a good start with these tips on positioning. 
  Correct positioning and attachment will prevent damage to the nipples. 
  You'll get better and better at following his cues. 
  - He may want both breasts at a time - Tit! 
  - Tit! 
  You can offer the second when it's appropriate. 
  Shhh, shhh, shhh. 
  Your nipple should be opposite your baby's nose It's like the end of a Pepperami. 
  THEY LAUGH Right, you are this close. 
  Darren is my new, very, very good mate that I met at dad classes. 
  It's going pretty well. 
  I actually feel like there's something there, do you know what I mean? 
  We're just going to take it slow and see what happens, really, but, yeah, really good.

  This is your final warning. 
  Do you understand? 
  Do you understand, Darren? 
  Yep. 
  Tickle her lips with the end of your nipple. 
  THEY LAUGH Wait until the baby's mouth is wide open, then I love tits.

  - If it was, like, quite a boring dream. 
  - Oh. 
  - You have it. 
  - You sure?

  Any minute. 
  One, two It's your baby Sorry, Miche, hold on. 
  - BOTH: - It's your baby shower. 
  Yay, let's not call it a baby shower, eh, Miche? 
  - We got you a sash. 
  Oh, so you did. 
  - Where's Craig? 
  - Honestly Well, you need to have a sash if it's a baby shower. 
  It's not a proper baby shower without one. 
  OK. 
  Craig's just through there, love. 
  Thanks. 
  Baby mumma. 
  A few baby bits here as well, so - Oh!

  Exciting. 
  Hello, Craig. 
  - Hi. 
  - Are you excited about the baby shower? 
  - Yeah(!) - Do you think Beats and Roche, do you think they make a good couple? 
  Yeah, they do, you know, they're having a baby together. 
  It's a really exciting time for them. 
  They're a strong united front. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Oh, thank you for these. 
  Hoodie. 
  - Simple. 
  - I love pink. 
  Gold boots. 
  Little booties, can't beat them. 
  It's an exciting time for them, you know. 
  They're just going to all grow together and Obviously they've got Craig there already, so it's a beautiful family unit that, you know, we all wish we could have. 
  So How is Bump? 
  Well, it's It's a baby. 
  Hello, Bump. 
  Oh, let's Nice and warm. 
  Yeah. 
  - What's she doing? 
  - Probably just lying there. 
  - Aw. 
  New developments in the champagne steam bar world. 
  Drumroll, please. 
  O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh! 
  Champagne steam bar? 
  Yeah, we know that. 
  And kitchen! 
  Come on! 
  My empire is constantly expanding, you know, I mean first of all I had the internet cafe, yeah? 
  Then I had my own nightclub, then I had my own bar, and now I'm throwing a restaurant into the mix. 
  And I'm saving money by having it all in the same industrial estate. 
  What happened to those colour-coded chopping boards - that I asked you for? 
  - Hmmm, OK. 
  They're on the way. 
  I'm just waiting for the paint to dry. 
  That's just a joke. 
  How's your new kitchen assistant doing? 
  Oh, he's doing really good. 
  All right. 
  Stevie. 
  Yeah, Steve, just use this and keep your sleeves clean. 
  - What's that? 
  - It's a tea towel. 
  - Tiny towel. 
  - You know, it's like The Apprentice. 
  You know, I'm Alan Brown Sugar, so these are my apprentices, and I have to put them through tasks and challenges, you know. 
  "Can you work on less than minimum wage?" "Can you work in conditions that probably will be inhumane?" Get back to work! 
  You know? 
  These are challenges, this is Apprentice, you know? 
  And then, if you're lucky enough, "You're hired. 
  " Seen these as well? 
  Tiny cups. 
  Like I'm a giant. 
  I am a giant, but More, more of a giant. 
  - Is he joking? 
  - Don't worry. 
  He's very cheap. 
  That is sick. 
  That is With an axe. 
  So what, mate? 
  I shouldn't be having to call shotgun. 
  It's my radio station, I'm your employer, end of. 
  - Yeah, but I pay you, though. 
  - To be at MY station! 
  So, the point is she shouldn't be sitting in the front seat. 
  - It's my seat. 
  Innit, Beats? 
  - Yeah, that's Grindah's chair, he's got the lumbar support exactly how he likes it. 
  No, not the In his car. 
  Oh, sorry, man. 
  Darren just sent over these jokes pranking videos. 
  Great, pranking's MY thing. 
  - f*ck's sake. 
  - Darren's really into it as well. 
  I think you'd really like him. 
  Ooh, no, I wouldn't. 
  I don't like anyone, and nor should you. 
  End of. 
  What do you think of Beats getting new friends? 
  I ain't here to tell Beats who he can and can't be mates with, do you know what I mean, like? 
  It's his life, let him do what he wants. 
  But don't come running back to me when it all goes wrong, do you know what I mean, cos man ain't going to be there in the end. 
  No, actually, I am going to be there to make sure I see his face when I have a go at him when he's learnt his lesson. 
  Don't need new friends when you've got a real friend like me. 
  Is that a new phone? 
  - Where did you get the P for that? 
  - Nah, Darren gave it to me. 
  - He had a spare one, so - What?! 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  He said I could have it. 
  He just gave it? 
  Do you know what? 
  I just thought - there's a new rule. 
  No phones at Radio. 
  You want to talk to your weird little mates and that, then do it on your own time, go out and speak to them, or your little girlfriends and that. 
  No phones. 
  Put your phones away. 
  No phones. 
  See that? 
  You can actually take pictures on it. 
  Yeah, but the battery lasts about two hours, so Yeah, but you can go on YouTube. 
  Well, on my Nokia the battery lasts three days. 
  - Yeah, it's sick though. 
  - No, not really. 
  That's going to table number seven. 
  That one's going to table number five, OK? 
  Is everything meeting your expectations? 
  Thank you. 
  Still a bit of meat on that. 
  I'm enjoying the perks of the new job, tenner a day and access to food. 
  Free foodthat hasn't been eaten yet. 
  Waste not want not. 
  If some of it has, then I'll just eat the rest of it. 
  So, old food? 
  Not old, but very much second-hand food. 
  OK, today we have the gourmet peri peri chicken, ã6. 
  Gourmet hot wings, ã6. 
  50. 
  And we also have my favourite, the avant garde avocado. 
  The main challenge of running a restaurant is the menu. 
  People don't want to just walk in and eat sh1t off a plate, yeah? 
  Give it a stupid name and they eat it. 
  "This is a Barcelona burger from Barcelona. 
  " You even put the lisp in the Barcelona. 
  Barcelona. 
  "Oh, it's organic, look at the mud. 
  " It's just been on the floor, mate. 
  Stupid bastards. 
  Do you know what I mean? 
  So, how's the wedding planning going? 
  God, has everyone been talking about it? 
  No, it's just you sent me a text invitation. 
  Yeah, and I'm barely sleeping from worrying about it all, so As long as Grindah's pulling his weight. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Where's Craig? 
  He's upstairs, love. 
  Craig! 
  Craig! 
  To be honest, I just thought, I mean, we would've been a bit more excited about it all. 
  But if anything, it feels like he avoids me quite a lot now. 
  Well, that's no good. 
  Oh, don't cry, Miche, don't. 
  SHE CRIES - I'm sorry. 
  - Don't apologise. 
  I just feel like I'm living a lie. 
  Like, what if he's not the perfect man that I think he is? 
  Oh, no - He's, um - Everyone thinks he's a dream man. 
  He's probably really nice when you get to know him. 
  - Who's there? 
  Dickhead who? 
  - HE LAUGHS What, you saying I'm a dickhead? 
  f*cking Darren, mate. 
  You're mental, Darren, mate. 
  Yeah. 
  We should go on holiday. 
  Beats. 
  Oh, I better go. 
  All right, mate, yeah, I'll see you tonight, yeah? 
  HE LAUGHS Stop now, mate. 
  Speak to you later. 
  Yeah, you should've told him you're at Radio. 
  What do you mean tonight? 
  What if I wanted to do something? 
  Darren said you could come down the pub as well, he wants to meet you. 
  No, I'm busy, actually. 
  - Is it? 
  - Yeah, with my real friend. 
  Do you ever get jealous? 
  Nah, I don't get jealous. 
  Like, Beats can do what he wants, it's not It's his life, innit? 
  I've given you an opportunity and you're running away with, like, different men and that, yeah? 
  Do your thing. 
  You up for doing something later? 
  Nah, I'm just going to have an early one tonight. 
  Yeah. 
  Fantasy, what about you? 
  I can't, man. 
  I've got cinema tickets. 
  Cinema? 
  I don't even go to the cinema any more. 
  It's like 14 quid a ticket. 
  - Tia. 
  - Yeah? 
  - My nan just came in. 
  - Nan! 
  - No way. 
  She just came in. 
  Nan! 
  Yes. 
  That is mad. 
  - I forget she can walk. 
  - Follow me. 
  What's your Nan's name? 
  - Just Nan. 
  - But what does everyone else call her? 
  Steves' nan. 
  OK. 
  Never mind, just go over there Yes, Nan. 
  You all right? 
  - How you doing, brother? 
  - Oh, right. 
  Handshake. 
  Formal. 
  Do you like this? 
  Look at that. 
  - Very smart. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yes. 
  - Lovely. 
  - Yeah. 
  Double-breasted. 
  This is actually what the professional chefs wear as well. 
  - Do you know what you lot want? 
  - I would like the chicken, Steve. 
  - Yeah, the chicken. 
  - The piri piri. 
  And then, if you don't finish it, don't worry. 
  All right? 
  Not really. 
  Beats is being a proper selfish prick. 
  Where's the money that you took from the wedding fund? 
  - Oh, yeah, no, I got that. 
  - Here you go. 
  Every little helps, innit? 
  There you go. 
  That was nothing. 
  That's not enough, like, this whole thing isn't enough. 
  Well, it's all right, chill out. 
  What's up with her? 
  There you go. 
  ã2 coin, yeah? 
  - Bang. 
  Happy? 
  - No, I'm not. 
  Why not? 
  Look, stop stressing yourself out all the time, it's just a wedding, right. 
  Why you gotta be so intense? 
  Do you even want to get married? 
  Huh? 
  Yeah, like, probably, I dunno, like, just Well, yes or no? 
  Yes, then. 
  Like, can't we just do it in a few years or whatever, when we've got more money and that, like? 
  There's no rush, is there? 
  I knew it, you don't even want to get married! 
  I sent out all the invitations, you're making me look stupid! 
  Well, I didn't tell you to send them out, so you're making yourself look stupid if anything. 
  Right, that's it. 
  What's the point in me doing all this wedding stuff? 
  - Ssshhhh, shut up. 
  - Why did you propose to me? 
  So do you ever argue with Miche? 
  Nah, not really, cos, like, me and Miche don't really get into arguments, cos most of the time I'm right, and if I'm not, I'm sort of clever enough not to admit that, so Getting into an argument with me is completely pointless. 
  - This is my house - It's our house And I don't want you here! 
  Go! 
  This isn't your house any more! 
  - Stop shouting in front of - f*ck off! 
  Stop shouting constantly in front of the camera.

  You're f*cking Well, joke's on you then, cos I was going to wear that at our wedding. 
  Well, I'm even more glad, cos it makes you look like a fat biker. 
  Don't EVER call me fat!

  Do you know what, I'm taking my ã2 back now. 
  Take it, I literally don't care any more.
