 They've taken down the f*cking aerial, man. 
  - Oh, my God! 
  - Surely that's wind damage, though, Decoy, right? 
  It's got to be wind damage. 
  It can't be Kold FM. 
  f*ck's sakes Got to be wind damage. 
  What do you reckon, Chabs? 
  It's definitely wind damage, right? 
  Yeah, I don't think this is done by wind damage, mate. 
  Not unless the wind used a baseball bat. 
  Running your own pirate radio station is a It's a big responsibility. 
  Being the leader's hard as well, and I really miss Grindah, cos I'm under a lot of stress. 
  Well, it's pretty obvious who's done it, innit? 
  Well, if it was the f*cking Kold FM boys, then we need an emergency meeting now. 
  Like, this ain't a joke! 
  I'm actually getting an M on the top of my head from all the stress. 
  - OFF-CAMERA: What, you're going bald? 
  - Yeah. 
  Well, my hairline's going weird. 
  I'm worried it's going to turn into an island. 
  Grindah would never let himself go bald. 
  Yeah, so, first time seeing Miche since I've .. 
  given up all the radio and drugs and that, so, yeah. 
  Trying to get it, like, normal hair sort of vibe. 
  OFF-CAMERA: Do you want Miche to think you've changed? 
  Course I want Miche to think I'm changed. 
  I want her to think, "Right, like, what's up with him? 
  "He definitely wants to get back with me and he's making an effort. 
  " Cos, like, there's this thing called grafting that chicks are obsessed with at the moment, yeah, and, like, what it means is basically just doing things that you'd never usually do, so that that girl thinks that you've suddenly changed into a better person. 
  Like, to me, that's the sort of modern version of romance, do you know what I mean? 
  - Square pasta sheets! 
  Mad, innit? 
  - Mm. 
  What you doing with my lasagne? 
  I'm making Miche a lasagne. 
  Yeah - nothing screams class like a lasagne. 
  Well, get your own f*cking lasagne sheets, then. 
  OK, cool. 
  Do you want me to get back with Miche and get out of your house, or? 
  - All right. 
  Fair point, yeah. 
  - Yeah, thought so. 
  You need some stock cubes as well. 
  - I'll show you where they are. 
  - Yeah, cool. 
  Just going to pop these down here So, what are you going to say to Daddy if he asks you about the glasses? 
  A crazy party you had with your friends. 
  Actually, maybe say dinner party, it sounds a bit classier. 
  When I was in a relationship, I'd say I would prefer to be in a relationship, but now I'm not in a relationship, I'm loving the single life, obviously. 
  Now, what else can we do to make it a bit more? 
  It's, like, the freedom. 
  I can just watch what I want on the telly, I can eat what I want for dinner. 
  You know, it's a real breath of fresh air, you know, just being alone, just with my own thoughts andyeah, just having that bit of time for me. 
  Miche time. 
  Shall we justmake it look a bit more, you know, like we've had fun? 
  Let's just Yeah. 
  That looks quite crazy, doesn't it? 
  - Um - Tomatoes are at the top. 
  - Ooh, OK. 
  - Straight from Italy, probably. 
  - Probably. 
  - Yeah. 
  Cool, have you got a bag or something? 
  You all right? 
  You ain't picking up your phone. 
  Did you hear that, Roche? 
  It's like a sort of hissing sound. 
  Yeah, sounds like a tiny, pathetic little snake. 
  Right, I am not getting involved in any of this, all right? 
  I've got to get ready for work, and don't forget you're looking after Robin today, innit? 
  All right, I'll see you later, darling. 
  - I'm looking after Robin today? 
  - Yeah. 
  You're looking after Robin. 
  BABY CRIES Listen, mate, I know we ain't talking and that, but we got a major f*cking problem. 
  The Kold FM boys destroyed our aerial. 
  Me and Grindah aren't chatting at the moment. 
  You know, when you break up with your girlfriend or whatever, and it's just you can't, like, eat and that, and it's a bit like that, really, but with this doom of Kold FM over my head. 
  See you later, mate. 
  See you later, Roche, OK? 
  Great. 
  BABY CRIES # Twinkle, twinkle, little star # How I wonder what you are - # Up above # - It's working, boys. 
  - What are we doing, anyway? 
  - Well, we're going to sort it. 
  Yeah, let's sort it. 
  Let's sort it, mate. 
  Yeah, I'm up for sorting it, definitely. 
  - What, so it's apeaceful? 
  - Do you have a plan? 
  - Resolution. 
  Yeah. 
  I do have a plan, Decoy. 
  I've decided that we should just . 
  . 
  just snitch. 
  No, I ain't not snitching, man, not me, man. 
  Yeah, me neither, man. 
  I'm not snitching. 
  - I'll snitch. 
  - Sweet, you can make the call, then. 
  No, we're definitely not snitching! 
  Yeah, we're definitely not snitching. 
  - Steve, stop throwing everyone off. 
  - Sorry, I just want peace. 
  I'll do it. 
  The studio's near my estate, so I'll see what I can find out. 
  Why didn't you say that before? 
  Perfect, because I actually hate snitching. 
  OK, cool. 
  You get the intel and then we can go down there and maybe do a stakeout. 
  BABY GRIZZLES - Right. 
  - OK, ready? 
  One, two, three, four ALL: # Twinkle, twinkle, little star # KNOCKING So how does Mummy look? 
  Nice. 
  - Hiya! 
  - Hiya! 
  - Oh, whoa, your hair looks . . better. 
  Oh, thanks. 
  I've come off the drugs. 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  I forgot to tell you, I'm officially a cold turkey. 
  - Wow! 
  - Yeah. 
  So I'm thinking about getting into CVs and that and maybe getting a job or whatever. 
  Well, that's amazing, yeah. 
  Well done, you. 
  Let me know if you need help with your spelling or your Word Art or anything. 
  Miche, that'd be incredible. 
  I might Oh, going out? 
  Oh, you know me, I'm just busy, busy, busy, nonstop, so - I'll see you in a bit. 
  - Yeah? 
  No worries. 
  See you later. 
  - You all right, Tanya? 
  - Oh, hi, Miche, I didn't think you were in today. 
  - Yeah. 
  No, I left the house a bit early, so I thought I'd just come and check in. 
  - Oh, that's nice. 
  Oh, you mean check in like that. 
  Yeah, I'm just saying I'm doing my hair, you know, just so Grindah and everyone else can see how well I'm doing. 
  - On Facebook. 
  - Exactly. 
  Tanya, would you mind just sort of pretending to cut my hair for me, - and then I can just get a picture of it for my Snap? 
  - Yeah. 
  Well, it's quite quiet. 
  Why don't we just give it a trim anyway? 
  No, haven't got time. 
  I need to check into a few bars before I go. 
  - So this is fine. 
  OK. 
  - Oh, OK And then just look really happy, yeah? 
  OK. 
  I've been really busy on social media since the break-up, just been checking in to anything and everything so that everyone can just see how well I'm doing. 
  - OFF-CAMERA: - Do you think social media shows your true self? 
  Definitely, because it's not me speaking to you right now, sort of saying any old thing that comes in my head, it's me sort of thinking about what I'm saying, deleting it, writing it again, deleting it and then posting to the world. 
  So, yeah, it's It's a more accurate me. 
  - All right? 
  Oh, that was quick. 
  - Thanks! 
  See you. 
  - Yeah. 
  OK, bye. 
  - Bye! 
  - Have a nice time tonight. 
  What was that? 
  It's like a hit-and-run. 
  - Is that all for his benefit, then? 
  - Course it is. 
  She's going to go and check in at the curry house over the road now. 
  We used to have water fights round here back in the day. 
  Yeah, it was sick, and then it got a bit stabby round here, so we just Yeah, made the water fights way more intense. 
  All right, sweet, yeah. 
  These are the blocks, here. 
  - Are you ready, Steven? 
  - Yeah. 
  OK, boys, keep it covert, yeah? 
  Let me just pop this down, get that ready. 
  - Here we go! 
  Good girl. 
  - Daddy's going undercover, Robin. 
  Please don't scream. 
  - OK, ready to go. 
  - Shh, shh-shh-shh-shh. 
  OK, let's go. 
  OK, come on. 
  - OFF-CAMERA: - Is it hard to find a pirate radio station? 
  A pirate radio station is the same as a woman - very elusive, very secretive, very deceptive, yeah? 
  They both lie a lot, you know? 
  But I say that, don't I? 
  I'm very good at finding people, you know. 
  I'm like that bloody Liam Neeson and that, you know. 
  I will find you. 
  I will track you down, and I will kill you Not kill you, but I will bloody get my Merc back. 
  We're just three lads, out with a baby, having a stroll. 
  - Three dads. 
  - Yeah. 
  No, lads, not dads. 
  Shh, shh-shh. 
  Check this out! 
  - Bruno! 
  - What are you doing? 
  Pretending I've got a dog, isn't it? 
  Improvise. 
  - Bruno? 
  - Bruno! 
  - My dog, Bruno! 
  - He might be in the bushes over there, somewhere. 
  - He might be, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  - Bruno! 
  - Bruno! 
  - WHISTLE BLOWS, BABY CRIES - Bruno! 
  - Oh, for f*ck's sake, Steve! 
  - I'm going to have to take her back. 
  - Can't leave Bruno here. 
  There is no Bruno, Steve. 
  - Sorry, Nan. 
  - Shh-shh-shh. 
  - No, she's not your nan, Steve. 
  How many times? 
  - She is my nan. 
  - You are my man, I know. 
  - Just be cool, be cool. 
  Yeah? 
  OK, just play it cool. 
  Just a couple of lads. 
  Bruno! 
  HE WHISTLES Bruno! 
  And that's peeling an onion. 
  It isn't actually as easy as it looks. 
  Oh, Jesus Christ, man! 
  Look at that! 
  Freshly chopped! 
  So that instantly starts Look at that! 
  - VOICEOVER: - Do you know what? 
  I love cooking. 
  I just never tried it. 
  Ah, you can really smell the flavours, can't you? 
  Ah! 
  None of that microwave lasagne, you got to do your own, know what I mean? 
  Buy your white sauce, buy your red sauce, buy the sheets, buy the meat, cook it all together and mix it. 
  Do you know what I mean? 
  Fresh, home-cooked lasagne. 
  So, are you moving back in? 
  Well, Angel, that's something me and your mum are going to have to discuss after she tries this wonderful little lasagne. 
  I still am the man of the house, just so you know. 
  Just because I don't live in the house, like, and that. 
  She ain't had no other man in the house, has she? 
  - Yes. 
  - What? 
  Who? 
  - Uncle Decoy. 
  - Oh, no, I'm thinking of other men that you don't know, like. 
  - Was there? 
  - No. 
  - No, good. 
  Because I will crush everyone, you know that, Angel, yeah? 
  Now, Robin, if that is your real name Do you remember this? 
  That's you. 
  "World's greatest grandma. 
  " Look at these, you remember these? 
  Your favourite, custard creams. 
  Remember them? 
  What about that? 
  Jog any memories? 
  Any flashbacks? 
  - VOICEOVER: - People are saying, "Oh, you think your nan "came back as a baby, yeah, that'syou're mad," or whatever, but reincarnation's a tricky one. 
  I've got an idea. 
  - VOICEOVER: - It's like if you're a butterfly, and you see your old caterpillar mate, and you're like, "Bruv, what you saying? 
  It's me. 
  " He might not recognise you, cos he remembers you as a caterpillar. 
  And it's the same with, like, people - like, you are evolving, you go into the next body and it's hard to keep track of, like, your old caterpillar mate, if you'rea butterfly. 
  What I'm going to do is I'm just going to show you this . 
  . and I want you to tell me if it's better with the glasses . 
  . or without the glasses. 
  So, that's with . 
  . or without? 
  Shall we try it one more time? 
  With . 
  . 
  or without? 
  It's inconclusive, I think. 
  Have to try something else. 
  Stakeouts are way better in movies. 
  Listen, Kev, mate, you wouldn't know of anyone who kind of deals in kind of short, substantial loans with kind of, like, minimum paperwork, no ID or anything? 
  Like, quick loans. 
  No, the only person I know is you. 
  OK, listen, Kevin, what I'm going to tell you right now might shock you. 
  - I'm bankrupt. 
  I need the loan. 
  - sh1t. 
  I lost everything, mate. 
  - I lost my restaurant - Serious? 
  - Yeah. 
  For the last two months, mate, I've been living in this van. 
  You know what I mean? 
  I'm pathetic. 
  I'm literally a man in a van. 
  It is kind of sick, innit, though? 
  I'd love this. 
  Like, no responsibility. 
  It's like living in a caravan. 
  You're a man of the road, Chabsy. 
  You're a road man. 
  - Yeah, I guess I am a bit of a road man. 
  - You are, yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah, you're living OG, off-grid. 
  I am an OG, yeah. 
  - Kind of like nomad style, you know. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Like, I'm not living by society's kind of rules and that. 
  - Exactly. 
  I'm like, kind of, just doing what I want to do, you know what I mean? 
  - Like, driving where I want to drive - Yeah! 
  - Hair blowing in the wind. 
  - Why not? 
  sh1tting in a bucket Just living life like I want to live life. 
  You sh1t in a bucket? 
  Shh, let's just con Keep your eyes peeled. 
  Brentford girls on tour, yeah! 
  - Woo! 
  - Wahey! 
  Love it. 
  - VOICEOVER: - I want Miche to be happy. 
  That's all, you know? 
  I think she deserves a really good man. 
  Yeah, but her idea of a good man is someone with money and chest hair, so That's not necessarily true. 
  I can take or leave the chest hair. 
  I mean, Mick was very smooth, and that boy in Turkey barely had armpit hair. 
  So. 
  Listen, Miche - Yeah? 
  - Yeah. 
  You know you said about, like, Grindah and stuff? 
  - Yeah. 
  - You are definitely on your own, ain't you? 
  - Yeah. 
  - There she is! 
  Carol! 
  - Mum, I don't - I've got a little surprise for you - Mum, please, please - Listen, it'd do you good. 
  - I'm really, really - Listen!

  Get on top of the cheese, please, Angel. 
  - OK, Dad. 
  - Teamwork, innit? 
  Yeah, man is a responsible man right now, innit, Ange? 
  - Yeah. 
  - I tell you I quit blazing? 
  Yeah. 
  It's been quite intense, actually. 
  I can't find the cheese grater. 
  Cheese grater! 
  Jesus Christ, these kids don't know they was born. 
  Angel, here you go. 
  Use this, yeah? 
  But cut it really small - thank you. 
  OK. 
  Oh, this red sauce is something else. 
  Oh, a little bit faster, all right, please? 
  Thank you.

  Let's settle this once and for all.

  Get out of the car, follow him on foot. 
  - Why have I got to follow him? 
  - Well, obviously I can't do it, man. 
  My whole style is based around being noticed. 
  I'm a peacock. 
  f*ck's sake, yeah, it's true. 
  You're too flamboyant. 
  - All right. 
  Chabsy? 
  - Yeah? 
  - Cover me. 
  - What?

  Yeah, cool, all right. 
  Kevin, clear! 
  You're covered on this side. 
  Shut up! 
  Oh, no, that's Hi there!

  No. 
  I wanted to put the finishing touches on our little surprise.

  SHOUTING CONTINUES Down there, mate. 
  Me and Mum actually went to Lanzarote, didn't we, recently? 
  We did, oh, we had a scream. 
  Hey, don't you show him all those photos! 
  Lanzagrotty, some people call it. 
  Just going to say, food's nearly done if you want to Yeah? 
  - You all right? 
  - Hello. 
  - Hi! 
  Yeah, it's just Just saying, er Trying to call you from there, you didn't hear me. 
  Food is nearly done, so if you want to OK, yeah. 
  Why don't you make yourself useful and go and get some wine? 
  No, don't be rude, Mum, no No, honestly, it's It'll be my pleasure. 
  - Thank you. 
  Thank you. 
  - Don't thank him. 
  Being nice does get you places, do you know what I mean? 
  Like, you've not seen it from me, cos I am a nice person, but when I'm at Kurupt and that, I've got to be, bang, on the ball, on the ball. 
  Carol? 
  Allow me. 
  Enjoy, enjoy! 
  Yeah, sure. 
  Thank you. 
  So with Miche, I've got to be nice, because then she'll realise, she'll be like, "Oh, is he actually a nice person now?" Little does she know that I'm pretending to be nice just to get her back, do you know what I mean? 
  And that just shows how much I care, I think. 
  Go on, then. 
  This is all yours, look! 
  Touch it! 
  That's all for you, that. 
  My nan left a load of money for me. 
  Umso I'm just sort of holding on to it for her. 
  You are rich for your age, definitely. 
  It's quite mad, actually, how much money you got. 
  Whatever she needs, I'll get it for her, then once she's old enough to understand money and reincarnation, I'll just sit her down and explain exactly what's going on. 
  Tuck in, they're going to see you, mate. 
  Tuck in, Kevin. 
  - Why won't they leave? 
  - Oh, my God! 
  Too young to die. 
  They better not touch my Merc, mate. 
  She's all I've got left. 
  - OFF-CAMERA: - Have you been in a lot of fights, then? 
  I've had one fight, actually, at Education In Dance at Brentford Leisure Centre. 
  This girl threw my cap off my head and then I said, "What are you doing?" And she just smacked me in the face. 
  So after that I just lowed it. 
  - Miche! 
  Food's ready. 
  - All right. 
  Oh, look at that! 
  Oh, wow It's good. 
  - There you go! 
  - My God, well done. 
  - Lasagne. 
  - It's very good.
