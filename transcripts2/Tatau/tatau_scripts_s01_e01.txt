 Hi, Tyler. Sorry, bit late. Budgie's fault. 
 Still on for later, though, yeah? 
 Yeah. Always. If you think you can handle it. 
 Hey, Dries, these are the guys I was telling you about. 
 They want to try the Avatavi. 
 Uh, we don't sell that any more, guys. It's verboden. 
 You got to leave. Come on. Go, go, go. Go! 
 Huh? 
 Sorry about that, guys. 
 We have to respect the culture here. 
 It's a sacred drink to some of the locals. 
 You know what it does? It's meant to send you a bit trippy, like mushrooms. 
 Depends on the person. 
 It's like, uh... going to a place you've never been before. 
 It can be really magical and empowering. 
 Or...deeply disturbing. 
 Most times, both. 
 Just as long as you're prepared for that, you're fine. 
 Mate, we want to get mashed, not brain-fried. 
 Sounds awesome. We're in. 50, right? Budge? 
 I left my money at the hostel. 
 Ah, of course you did. 
 Well, I tell you what, here's 50 for him as well. 
 Great. OK, come back at six and we'll go through the bush. 
 I know a special place. It's really private. It's going to be perfect. 
 Have a good one. 
 Are you sure we want to do this? 
 This is the Manutaki experience. 
 Try everything, right? 
 Tyler reckons it's amazing. 
 So you managed a conversation then? 
 In between your bouts of frenzied jungle s*x. Sorry, I... 
 I did ask if she had a friend. Next time, I'll... Whoa! 
 I knew I'd been saving myself for a reason, and oh, my days - she's it. 
 Sorry, that seat's taken. Correct. 
 It's for my boyfriend. 
 You're not only beautiful, you're psychic, too. 
 I'm Budgie. 
 Your future boyfriend. 
 Sorry, uh, he forgot his meds. 
 Come on, Budge, don't hit on the local girls, remember? 
 Hey. Hey! 
 I'm Maui. Kia Orana means welcome. 
 Kyle. Derek Wiggins. All right? 
 Nice moko. You get that done here? 
 Er, no. Croydon. 
 Uh, England. 
 I designed it myself. 
 Do you know what these symbols mean? 
 Uh, no, just thought they looked good. 
 Why? 
 It's, uh, it's very...pretty. 
 So what was your name again? 
 Lara. Have a good trip. 
 Derek Wiggins? 
 If I'm going to steal his girl, I'll need some kind of insurance. 
 And you might want to get that translated, in case it's offensive. 
 It's a shame Tyler didn't join us. 
 Avatavi is an aphrodisiac also, man. 
 You should've invited Lara. 
 She must have dumped that Maui bloke by now. 
 Weird she hasn't phoned yet. 
 Supportive(!) Cheers. 
 Maui Vaipiti? Please, guys, be careful, OK? 
 That is not a guy you insult. 
 His family are very influential, with many friends. 
 Including myself. 
 There's something else I need to warn you of. 
 An encounter you might have. 
 The White Lady of Manutaki. 
 She's a Momoke - a creature not of this world. 
 This jungle... this is her domain. 
 Not everyone sees her... but if you do, just run! 
 Don't touch her. 
 Don't let her touch you. 
 Or you'll be dragged down into the pool where she lives. OK? 
 The Momoke, they're spirit snatchers. 
 They leave your body intact, they just steal away your soul. 
 Just like that. Pow! 
 That's why I asked if you could handle it. 
 I've seen people afterwards who have never recovered. 
 They have literally... gone insane. Pow! 
 Nice one. Love a wind-up! 
 Look at Budgie's face. 
 I'm cool. That was crap, mate. Three out of ten. 
 Right, let's drink. 
 Get her out here and party. 
 Just don't say I didn't warn you, OK? 
 Tukua te vaeru kia rer ki tona anoano. 
 Allow one's spirit to fulfil its potential. 
 (He gulps) 
 (He yelps) 
 (He cries out in fright) 
 (Her voice is distorted) 
 (Her voice is distorted) Help! Please, save me! No, wait! Come back! Come back! What the hell? It's OK - it's me, Kyle. Remember? We - we met yesterday at the - at the beach cafe? And that makes lying in my boat, naked, acceptable, does it? Uh... Cover yourself up and get the hell out of my house! I'm so sorry. I'm really dreadfully sorry. Sorry. Good morning, my friend. How are you feeling? Bit freaked out, mate... frankly... and kind of needing an explanation. Obviously, we slept together. Uh, I don't, I don't think so, somehow. Thank you. I'm straight. Whoa. I said we slept together. That's all. You were feverish. You were shivering all over, man. I had to make sure you kept warm. Are you always this homophobic? Never. Live and let live, mate - that's my philosophy. But we... we didn't? (He chuckles) I just love the English. They're so uptight about so little. What do you mean, little? Kyle? Is that you? (He laughs) I'll see you at breakfast. The bugs in my arms, yeah? That was just trippy sh1t, but this girl, I'm telling you. I'm telling you, when she knew I'd seen her, and she came towards me... She wasn't wearing white, by any chance, was she? I think this is what it was. My ghost story planted this idea. And that just turned into this creepy hallucination. It was a red dress, not a white one. She had this tattoo. I could smell her perfume. She looked terrified. I'm not surprised. You coming towards her stark bollock naked. I wasn't naked when I saw her. At least, I don't think so. Do you have a girlfriend back home? Someone special? No. Ahhh! Was it your choice? Or hers? See, that's how Avatavi works - it taps into the subconscious and releases all these repressed feelings. Or I was just tripping. Like you said. What?! He was chasing a girl who just wanted to get away, man. How much clearer could it be? They lost their kid. All right? So back off. Budge! Budgie! She's there. I found her. She's dead. What are you talking about? The girl from last night. She's out there, in the water, tied up. She's dead. Someone killed her. I told you she was real. Where are you going? To get the police. Kyle, Kyle, listen, listen, listen. You're still tripping, OK? It's really common. Some people get flashbacks for days. It's OK, man. You've got to stop him. Kyle! Wait! I wasn't tripping, she was there. OK, I believe you. I believe you. Right? But think about it. You were the last person to see her and you don't remember anything. And now she's dead. Think about how that looks, mate. This is the police. We don't know these people. So what you saying? Just leave her? We can tell the police where to look. Anonymously. Without getting involved. I could've helped her. Kyle! You don't know what you did. She was there. This is the spot. She was weighted down. If a shark had taken her, it would've bitten through the rope. The concrete weight would still be there. Blood and stuff. It would have been a frenzy. Dries said the sea was calm. No movement at all. So, I explained to the Sergeant about our, uh... our little party last night. Avatavi? Yes. We're really sorry. Big time. Aren't we, Kyle? You know, wasting police time is a serious matter. And I think we're all grateful to Sergeant Taringa for kindly agreeing not to take this matter any further. Absolutely. Thank you. There's been no missing girl reported? No-one local? None. She had a tattoo on her arm. The symbols were kind of like this. He said no-one's missing. And we accept that. Thank you, Sergeant. And apologies, again. Thanks. You guys have no idea what kind of a bullet we just dodged. Kyle? I saw this. Last night, too, in the jungle. It's done now. Let's move on. Get back to the mainland. Start earning some green. Do you ever feel like you're cracking up? Like you're some kind of nutter? It's why we're mates in the first place. She was there, Budge. I didn't imagine her, but... I must have. Look, I've got some sleeping tablets in my room... No. No more drugs. They're just downers. Prescription stuff, for the flight. It's still affecting me. I can hear it whispering. Still. Look, what you need to do is just chill out. Just take the pills and get some sleep. OK? Yeah. Back in a sec. 
 
 (White noise intensifies) (No!) (Phone rings) Hey, Mum. Can I call you back? Where's my mum? How come you've got her phone? No, I'm in Norwich. Yeah, I've got, erm... I've got a score lined up. You'll get your money. End of the week. Look, can I talk to my mum, please? (Door slams) Hello, Mum? Hey, you OK? Yeah, I-I-I'll get you a new one. And TV. And anything else he's taken. Look, when he's gone, I need you to take off and stay with someone else. I'll deal with it, I promise. I love you. Yeah... Fair enough. (Intense music) Hey, wait! That symbol is her tattoo, the girl I saw. You drew them, didn't you? What do they mean? Tell me. Please. In maori : I roto I tana moe kua kite aia a ia Aumea. Sorry, I don't understand. I der. I der. I der. Sorry. Hello? Anyone there? (He sighs) Finally! One beer coming right up. Mate, where have you been? (He pants) I found these. Look. That's her. That's the girl I saw. She's a real. And that's Lara and Maui. She's with Lara and Maui. They know her. Where did you get these? It doesn't matter. All that matters is that I wasn't hallucinating. Whoa, hold on. Wait. What are you going to do? I'll be cool. I promise. Hiya. Can I buy you a drink, apologise for this morning? It's fine. Dries explained. I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. It sounded awful. Worse for her. That's the girl I saw. So who is she? Smooth. Nice job. She's a friend of yours, right? What's her name? Mate...relax. I just want to know who she is. Everyone else seems to. Her name's Aumea. She is my friend and Maui's sister. How did you get these? Those are my Uncle Marshall's photos, from his shack. Did you steal them? Borrowed. Oh, with his permission? Did Dries not tell you what I saw? Your sister's dead. (They laugh) What? No, my sister's alive and well, in New Zealand. Our father spoke to her this morning. Saw her on Skype. So, clearly, one of you must have been hallucinating. No. Are you saying he doesn't know his own daughter? Or are you calling me a liar? Maui, he's not well. How about I get everyone a drink? No, no, they've had enough. They should leave now. Get some rest. And I'll, er, I'll return these to my uncle with your sincere apology, yes? Absolutely. He's very sorry. (Mate.) (Tribal drumming) Budge, just listen to me. I'm not saying that's what did happen, I'm just saying it could have. You must see that it's possible. Yes... in Bizzaro World. Dries works for Maui. He's admitted to being his friend. So what? So he was alone on the beach when we went to get the police. He had a good hour before we got back. Be easy enough for him to have phoned Maui, get a boat out there, pull the girl out and take her somewhere else. Can you hear yourself? It's Maui's sister. Why would they kill her? And why dump her 30 feet from the beach where any snorkeler could find her? They'd have taken her way out into the ocean. And how could Maui's father have spoken to her this morning? You've got to stop thinking what people tell you is the truth. Amen to that. Most murders happen between family. I'd kill my lot given the chance. Budgie told me about your trip. Sounded really intense. She's done the 'tavi thing too. I thought she might have some advice. So you think Maui lied about his father? There's a real easy way to find out. (Congregation sing) Reverend : Amen. (Singing stops) All : Amen. That's Maui's father, Anaru, and that's his wife Paeta next to him. (Reverend speaks in maori) We greet and welcome new sinners... rejoicing in their desire to find love and forgiveness in Our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Praise him. All : Amen. Let his light cleanse you, absolve you of your wickedness, so that the redemption you have sought for so long may at last be found. (White noise intensifies) (His heart beats loudly) This is a holy place... on a hallowed isle, resting in sacred seas. And all who bathe in its waters are blessed. All : Amen. Do not weep for them... for their sins lie discarded on the ocean floor... (Help me...) ..while their souls float free in atonement and salvation! Amen. All : Amen. You OK? I'm fine. Let's just get this sorted, one way or another. Kia orana! Come on in. They are in the garden. Whoa! I've got to get me a pad like this. Then set up a pearl farm. They own most of them around here, have done for generations. Earns them a fortune. So big respect, OK? She means don't nick anything. Or don't get caught. They're coming over. Welcome, friends. I'm Anaru Vaipiti. Kia orana, Tyler. My wife, Paeta. Kia orana. Reverend Calcott. And you must be Kyle. My son, Maui, told us of your misfortunate delusion. Right, only I don't think... Where else would you come when you are troubled and seeking enlightenment? You must lay your concerns to rest. My daughter, Aumea. She's safe and well. You've spoken to her? Seen her? Every day. Although she's far away, she is in our hearts always and forever. Amen, there. So please come, break bread with us and share in the blessings our good Lord has provided. (He beckons them) You ever seen The Wicker Man? No, why? I think this is the sequel. Maui said you chose these symbols yourself. Why this design over any other? I don't know. It's been in my head for years. I kept sketching it over and over and then finally had it done. It's your mark. What does it mean? It's our journey, it's our purpose to discover what we are. My own history and fortune is here. This symbol represents Tane, God of the Forests. Here, his daughter, Hine-nui-te-po... (White noise) ..whose colour is red. (Help me...) She is the Goddess of Death and you'll find her idol everywhere on this island. She is our guardian but also a warning of our journey's end. We all get to see her eventually. And we must all be prepared for that day of judgment. Men : Amen. They said she's studying in New Zealand, Auckland University, so that's where I'm going. Find out if it's true. You've got to be kidding me. And when you find her, then what? You'll get a sincere apology... and a choice of what we do next. Fine. I'm going to check out these pearl farms. You know it's getting heavy back home. Yeah, you can when we get back, cos we're not going to find her. It's a cover-up, Budge. The family, the pastor, maybe even Tyler, too, and definitely the police. Maui's got Sergeant Taringa in his pocket. They're hiding every trace, every clue. OK, let's just pretend that's not the most insane thing you've ever said. Suppose it's true... what can we do about it? Report her missing to the New Zealand Police. And if they tell you, quite rightly, to get lost? I'm not the only one that thinks this. There's a guy on the island, an old Maori. He showed me where to look for those photos. An old Maori? Right. That doesn't sound crazy at all! What if I could have saved her? I need to know, Budge... that it wasn't my fault. Please. Airport PA : Passengers on the incoming flight from Auckland will shortly be in the arrivals hall. You should've told Tyler. I'll text her from the plane. We're coming back. It's just if Maui finds out what we're doing, he might try to stop us. I think you're right. (Now what do we do?) Front it out. They can't hurt us here, not with everyone watching. You sure about that? Oh, you guys aren't leaving us, are you? I-It's been great. Great memories... but it's time to go. Why are you here? We're meeting someone. Perhaps you'd like to meet them, too. (Intense music) Hey, sis. Hi, Peckham. How are you? Aumea. This is Kyle and Derek, two travellers who have been...enjoying our island. Hi. Pleased to meet you. Us too. And you have no idea how much. Isn't that right, Kyle? You boys have a good flight. Job done, right? She's alive! How could I have imagined someone I've never met before? That's her, exactly. Same dress, same everything... except for the tattoo. Didn't she have one? No. Not yet, anyway. What's that supposed to mean? She's going to turn. What? She's going to turn back and look at me. Now. I imagined that, too. In the church, earlier, I saw her, in that dress, looking back at me. It's going to happen. Everything I've seen is going to happen to her. It just hasn't happened yet. You must leave! Now! Someone's going to kill you. They're going to drown you in that dress. It's my wedding tattoo. That means I'm right. The first time I ever saw you and that tattoo was when I drank the Avatavi. I must insist that you promise never to come here again. Nah. No more, no way. Stop it! Who wants you to do this? Him! There's no-one there! You're cracking up mate, can't you see that? Argh! (Crashing)
