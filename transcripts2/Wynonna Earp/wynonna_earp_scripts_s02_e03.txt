 Previously on "Wynonna Earp"... 
   This condo's being built on an old school. 
   Anything original still left? 
   - A few nooks and crannies. 
  - Demons... 
  they do exist. 
   And now I kill them. 
   This night wouldn't be complete  without a hellish road trip through my childhood. 
   It's alright to miss him, Wynonna. 
   She's my sister, Nicole. 
  I have to protect her now more than ever. 
   I just wanna make sure you're OK, that deep down,  - you're still my Waverly. 
  - Totally. 
   I'm afraid the scary's just beginning. 
   Why is she haunting me?

   Devils!!! 
   - Wow. 
  - I didn't know if it was your thing. 
   Baby, that's... 
   - that's everybody's thing. 
  - Yeah? 
   Yeah. 
  The cross-eyed hooligans  at the Homecoming game are gonna love it. 
   No, silly. 
   No, this is a private show for you,  before you have to go off on patrol... 
   Nedley figures the streets  are gonna be awash with booze and urine  all weekend. 
  So it's all hands on deck. 
   You guys need to get some more hands,  so that yours can stay right here. 
  On me. 
   OK. 
  Ready? 
   Time for one more cheer! 
   - Come on, boys, from here to there... 
  - Girl, put on some underwear! 
   Wynonna! 
  Hi... 
   Just... 
   passing through. 
   You guys can resume your panty-less roleplay. 
   You know what? 
  I gotta get to work. 
   - You gonna come by? 
  - Hanging from afar  while my lady works? 
  That's my jam. 
   OK. 
   Yeah. 
   So, now that I know your whole situation,  should we institute a knickers- on-the-doorknob policy? 
   Since you're not using yours. 
   Wow. 
  Rough night? 
   No, I just can't stop seeing it. 
   The gory ritual, the broken seal. 
   It's just, every time I close my eyes, it's the same nightmare. 
   Right, but nothing else has... 
  happened, right? 
   Yet. 
   - I forgot you were head cheerleader. 
  - And Prom Queen. 
   Prom. 
  That's that thing people do  when they're not institutionalized at 14, right? 
  That sounds nice. 
   Are you going to be this much fun all day? 
   Maybe I'll just skedaddle, you know,  leave you at the mercy of monsters, go on the lam. 
   - What is a lam, anyway? 
  - Still no sign of Dolls, huh. 
   And I don't expect one. 
   You've polished the shaft hard enough. 
   You so rarely hear that. 
   I need to be ready. 
  It's Homecoming. 
   I might have to protect the people who tortured me in high school. 
   - They weren't all bad. 
  - No, they were champs. 
  Every one. 
   All for this? 
   - I was such an idiot. 
  - The time has come. 
   I come to claim what's mine.

   Bryce Cooper. 
   Star right wing of the '07 champs. 
   The last Purgatory High School team to not only win the cup,  but a single game. 
  I'm gonna pass this off. 
   To Black Badge? 
  This is straight up homicide. 
  It's ours. 
   We've got people coming home from all over for the game. 
   If this news gets out, it'll be pandemonium. 
   Just examine the scene, then scrub it. 
   You mean cover it up? 
   Tomato, potato. 
   Earp? 
   - Restocking already? 
  - They say liquor sells itself. 
   Bet the sight of you pourin' it don't hurt either. 
   How does our latest cocktail progress? 
   - It doesn't. 
  - If you need more, I'll open another. 
   - Not more. 
  Different. 
  Yours isn't right. 
  - Clock is ticking, Rosita. 
   What do you want me to do? 
  We need something pure. 
   And more tequila. 
   - What can I get ya? 
  Spritzer? 
  - Whoa, you're... 
   Uh, just looking for the boss man. 
   So no spritzer then. 
   - Wynonna! 
  - Excuse me? 
   Is Henry here or...? 
   - Wynonna! 
  BITCH!! 
  - Hey, Mercedes. 
   Oh... 
  working. 
   Who isn't? 
   So, how are you settling in? 
   How are Beth and Tucker? 
   My siblings are acting like I moved home  to... 
  ruin their Grey Gardens spiral into reclusive weirdoness. 
   Which I did. 
   - Every family tree's got its share of nuts. 
   Speaking of nuts. 
   When's the last time you had your hands on some? 
   Seriously? 
  That's your pitch? 
   Perry Needs-to-get-an-actual- personality Crofte? 
   Like you never snuck into the locker room  - to sniff his jock strap. 
  - Never into jocks. 
   Now straps... 
   How 'bout your broken heart? 
  Yeah, I can sniff that from here. 
   It makes my nostrils sad. 
   Uh,  Perry was besties with that Bryce guy, right? 
   I don't know. 
  Why are you asking me? 
  Hey! 
  Perry! 
   - Hey, shh! 
  - Perry, hi! 
  Come on over! 
   - Shut up. 
  - Here he comes. 
   - Why? 
  - You remember Wynonna? 
   Oh! 
   - Oh! 
  The girl everyone was scared of. 
  - Even you? 
   There were rumours, I guess 'cause your dad and sister... 
   You had a breakdown. 
   That didn't do it for you, huh? 
   - Try not to slide off your stool. 
  - How long you around? 
   Uh, permanently. 
   Good talk, Per. 
  I hate you. 
   So, what's her deal? 
   She looks, um... 
  good. 
   She's doing good. 
   - Some kind of special detective. 
  - For what? 
   Stuff the cops can't handle. 
   Any chance I can get her number? 
   What am I, human Tinder? 
   - There you are. 
  - Here I be. 
   One of the guys from the '07 team. 
   Champs? 
   Hockey? 
   Wow. 
  Never mind. 
   Somebody -or something- tore out his liver. 
   I wonder if it's connected to our symbol-smasher. 
   We also still have a dozen new demons  flooded the triangle to round up for Black Badge. 
   It's a rich tapestry of awful. 
   She seems super smart. 
   She's the best mixologist around. 
   Ooh... 
  Bet she shakes in all the right places. 
   I love that you've got your own thing going on here,  but don't get distracted. 
   If you need me on a case, you have my undivided attention. 
   OK. 
   Look, I was up half the night. 
  Buried alive in dread. 
   - Mm, no. 
  - Abstaining, are we? 
   Two shots of tequila is not abstaining. 
  It's called being a professional. 
   Back in my day, that meant something else entirely. 
   OK. 
  I'm heading to work. 
   - See if Jeremy's made any progress. 
  - Shall I accompany you? 
   Don't you need to babysit  your 'professional' mixologist? 
   So, this broken seal on the school chapel:  I've been able to puzzle certain designs of what looks to be  some kind of ancient symbol. 
   Soon I'll have enough to start cross-referencing it  with similar archaic patterns  - and look into what it might mean. 
  - "Looks to be?"  "Soon?" "Might?" Pretty weak. 
   What about big dead Bryce? 
   Nicole pass on the evidence? 
   Oh, do you mean "forensics"? 
   Don't air quote, that's my thing. 
   And is Officer Haught always so passive-aggressive  when handing off cases to BBD? 
   None of my business, like everything else around here,  - yeah, got it. 
  - Any connection to our symbol-smasher? 
   I don't see one. 
   But it's no simple murder either. 
   The victim's liver was harvested,  but he had no opioids in his system. 
   And no defensive wounds. 
   - It's like he let it happen. 
  - Or he ripped it out himself. 
   - Where's Lucado? 
  - Called away. 
  On a personal matter. 
   Has, uh, Dolls reached out to you at all? 
   - Nice try, but snitches get stitches. 
  - I'm not... 
   OK, never mind. 
   And next time, tell Officer Haught to please  close the victim's eyes. 
  It's creepy. 
   He's staring right at it. 
   - Staring at what? 
  - The trophy case. 
   Champs 2007 and all that. 
   Oh yeah, you are. 
   - Hello? 
  - Wynonna? 
  It's Perry. 
   Perry Crofte? 
   - I was just thinking about you. 
  - See? 
   After all these years, we're finally in sync. 
   - Like a sorority's monthly cycles. 
  - You're fun. 
   - I haven't had any fun in a long time. 
  - OK... 
   Are you asking me out? 
   - One hundred percent. 
  - Great. 
   We can chat. 
   - Uh, should I pick you up... 
  - No! 
   No, I'll pick you up. 
   Same place? 
  Out in the boonies? 
   Some things never change, huh? 
   I hope that's not true. 
   - Bye! 
  - Bye. 
   Yep. 
  Totally in sync. 
   Scarlett Tart? 
  Or Pink Tease? 
   Flaming Ladybug? 
  Wait, which skit are we doing? 
   The one where we debate which lipstick I should borrow. 
   Ah, OK... 
   So it is a date date, huh? 
   Where's he taking ya? 
   - Under the bleachers? 
  - Hey, watch your perfectly glossed mouth. 
   Bryce and Perry were teammates. 
   Maybe Perry knows something. 
  It's a cover. 
   Sure, wink. 
   Like how I'm going on "patrol" with Nicole. 
   Look, I'm just... 
  glad you're putting yourself out there,  you know, having fun. 
   Why is everybody so obsessed with my fun levels? 
   Because if something does come out of that seal,  I want you at Peak Wynonna:  whisky, soaked and reckless. 
   He's here. 
   On the homestead? 
   At least we know he's not a Revenant. 
   It's great to see so many faces back in town  for the first Annual Purg High Homecoming game! 
   You have my word,  Purgatory: We. 
  Will. 
  Turn. 
  This. 
  Town. 
  Around! 
   Where's Bryce? 
  He said he'd be here. 
   And I'm so frikkin' excited  to be here with the '07 Champs to announce that, this spring,  ground will be broken on the brand new Gardner Community Centre! 
   Yes, my parents left most of their fortune to the town. 
   Wonderful, isn't it? 
   Yes, it's great. 
   I... 
  I could just scream. 
   Ahem! 
  Yeah, so let's hear it one more time  for the Champs, and you get in there and enjoy the game! 
   - Hey, Per. 
  - Jesus! 
   What? 
   You OK? 
   Not bailing on me, are ya? 
   Sorry. 
  It's just... 
   some date, right? 
   Well, you gotta give the people want they want. 
   And what they want is to celebrate Purgatory's big win. 
   - Again and again. 
  - And again. 
   It's all so... 
  pathetic. 
   - I didn't mean that. 
  - Celebrating something so pointless. 
   We were teenagers. 
  Playing a game. 
   Ten freaking years ago. 
   Yeah, well,  this town has trouble letting go of the past. 
   I wish past me had paid a little more attention to some things. 
   Do you wanna get out of here? 
   - Get something to eat? 
  - Hey now,  we can do both. 
  Perry,  I need to talk to you about Bryce. 
   What kind of detective are you, anyways? 
   - Wait, what about Bryce? 
  - Perry? 
   Oh! 
  It's happening, man! 
   - It's HAPPENING! 
  - Easy, Skip. 
  What? 
   Everything! 
   B-Train... 
   he's DEAD! 
  Bryce's wife called me, freaking out, man. 
   - The cops found him yesterday! 
  - You're drunk and you're talking too much. 
   - You said you'd FIX it!! 
  - He's out of his mind. 
   - I'll take him home. 
  - Hold up. 
   Bryce's nickname is B-Train? 
   Hm, shady and suspicious,  therefore gettin' more delicious. 
   Calm down, Flaming Ladybug. 
   - Waverly! 
  - Hey! 
   - Ooh, where's Perry? 
  - Messed up,  emotionally unavailable, possibly-involved-in-a-murder Perry? 
   Oh my God, you're gonna ask him to marry you. 
   Also I just found out his dead friend's nickname was B-Train. 
   I would've milked that so hard in high school. 
   - We need to get to Skip Morgan's house. 
  - Oh, I'm meeting Nicole. 
   Well, waiting for her to get off work. 
   You're gonna pass up a chance to crack a case  - to wait around for your girlfriend? 
  - So what? 
   So I'm having flashbacks of you  watching Champ play video games and  missing your Valedictorian speech. 
   He got to level 70 on one guy. 
   - Waverly. 
  - Besides, this is different, OK? 
   You've come so far. 
   Just don't let anyone make you forget you're an Earp. 
   Look, that can mean whatever I want it to, OK? 
   Here, take the jeep. 
   When you stop dating psychos,  you can give me relationship advice. 
   Hey, come on! 
   - Boop! 
  - Waverly, um,  as we speak, Shorty's crowd is staggering over here  for sports-yelling and down-falling. 
   Look, baby, I'm off in a couple hours. 
  Can't you... 
   entertain yourself? 
   Wave! 
   Not in uniform, OK? 
  Not in public. 
   Not good enough. 
   Hey! 
   Give me your phone. 
   You must be new. 
   - If I find upskirts on there... 
  - You might. 
   Also the video of you and Waverly making out. 
   I don't think that's allowed. 
   - OK... 
  - Let him go. 
  It's not worth it. 
   - Excuse me? 
  - It's Tucker. 
  He's a Gardner. 
   I don't care what he does. 
  Give me your damn phone. 
   If that's broken, you'll pay for it. 
   OK, you know what? 
   You're under arrest for obstructing a peace officer. 
   Ow! 
  Ow, ow! 
   - She's hurting me, Waverly! 
  - Nicole, you don't wanna do this... 
   Don't tell me how to do my job. 
   Perry? 
   Skip? 
   It's too late. 
   - It got B-Train. 
  - B-Train. 
   What's that? 
   Perry put it there. 
   He's out of his gourd. 
   Perry marked you with blood? 
   Ugh, he's so hot. 
   Any chance he also crawled out of an ancient broken seal? 
   The time is nigh. 
  I will claim what is mine. 
   - Holy farked up Wizard of Oz bullshit! 
  - No! 
   Stop! 
   OK, good. 
  Now roll over. 
   Beg? 
   Dude! 
  What are you doing? 
   It'll go through you to get what it wants,  and it wants my guts, man. 
   - Run! 
  - Not big on cardio these days. 
   Where'd you... 
   Here, boy! 
   Skip, you stupid drunken idiot! 
   I'm just glad B-Train's not alive to see this. 
   Thank you. 
   Who is that? 
   That's one of Tucker's older sisters. 
  Beth Gardner. 
   - You're letting her bail him out? 
  - There's no bail required. 
   - He's not being charged. 
  - Wha... 
   He was taking photos of teenage girls. 
   His phone was practically up their hoo-has. 
   Oh! 
  Language! 
   Nicole, you're a Sheriff's Deputy. 
   Not gonna win cop of the year, mind you,  with that public display of gal-pal-itis. 
   I'm sorry about Waverly. 
  But those photos... 
   Love the initiative,  but the Gardners... 
   Tucker's parents were good people. 
   Important people, to this town. 
   - Boys will be boys. 
  - Whoa. 
  Sorry,  did I hit my head and wake up in patriarchal bullshit land? 
   It looks fine to me. 
   That reminds me, though... 
  the first aid kit needs restocking. 
   I want her charged with harassment. 
   Oh, you have not seen harassment. 
   - Such a nasty woman. 
  - I know, baby. 
  I know. 
   Look, you cool your heels  while you take a chunk out of those reports in there. 
   - You're putting me on paperwork? 
  - They're the Gardners. 
   Nicole, keep your head in the game. 
   You'll learn how this town works. 
  It only took me thirty years. 
   It's probably out of water. 
   One of the two ingredients in coffee? 
  That's a fail. 
   I just came to get some books for Waverly. 
   So she wouldn't have to come herself and risk running into me. 
   Uh, I mean, she didn't... 
  she didn't say that, so... 
   Anyway, gotta jet. 
   Kinda dealing with a demon scarecrow thing. 
   Wynonna... 
   Have you noticed any... 
   like, changes in Waverly lately? 
   - Are you hoping for some? 
  - No! 
   It's just... 
  ever since Willa was... 
  sent down,  - she's been acting... 
  not herself. 
  - Hmm. 
   Well, one sister kills the other. 
   - Might rattle your cage a bit. 
  - No, of course. 
   It's just, what I really love about Waverly is... 
   it's like it's sometimes missing, you know, a sweetness. 
   And... 
  she's become hard. 
   Cruel, almost. 
  More... 
   Like me? 
   Is this because she kept you out of Black Badge? 
   You know what? 
   Forget it. 
   I think we both know I won't. 
   Awesome day. 
   Perfect. 
   - What's this? 
  - What Perry... 
   - Her date. 
  - It wasn't a date. 
   What Perry scrawled across Skip's front door  and his forehead - in blood, just before Skip was attacked  - by one ugly hockey fan. 
  - You think your date summoned this demon? 
   A demon who makes people tear out their own insides, yeah. 
   He at least buy you dessert? 
   - Guys. 
  - Did Perry break the seal? 
   - No, that doesn't make sense. 
  - But if it's not connected,  then what the hell are we doing? 
   Bagging and tagging low-level sh1t disturbers  to get Lucado off BBD's naughty list? 
   - Wynonna, it's OK. 
  - No, it's not! 
   I know something evil and terrifying is coming, OK? 
   Even my hair is tingling. 
  And without Dolls... 
   Cover me. 
   - Perry? 
  - I heard everything. 
   It's true, you are some kind of paranormal warrior. 
   Don't want him summoning monsters on your front stoop. 
   OK, except... 
   It's an Algiz. 
   An ancient ruinic guardian symbol. 
   He wasn't trying to summon something to attack his friends. 
   He was trying to protect them. 
   I'll get my vapours. 
   Gah! 
   - What the Goddamn hell!? 
  - Salts of hartshorn. 
   Pardon the error in judgment. 
   - Are you kidding me? 
  Wynonna... 
  - OK. 
   A creature is making your friends tear themselves apart,  you're drawing protection symbols to try to stop him,  and unless you want us to make your day truly chomp nard,  you'd better start talking. 
   You'd never believe it. 
   Try me. 
  I'm Wynonna Earp, Demon Detective. 
   The Blue Devils were a joke. 
  We'd had enough. 
   Senior year, Old Coach Moore, he gave us a... 
   spell. 
   He was batshit crazy about losing all the time. 
   So me, Skip, Cam and Bryce... 
   - B-Train. 
  - Wynonna. 
   We didn't take it seriously, but... 
   we hit the bong and said the words. 
   Then, I sh1t you not,  this thing appeared out of the trophy case. 
   Freaky grain sack over its face. 
   It barely spoke, but we just understood that  we'd have ten amazing years. 
   Get whatever we wished for. 
   We were seventeen,  ten years sounded like forever. 
   We didn't realize it'd kill us. 
   And now Burlap Jack's back for his pound of flesh. 
   We all make deals we regret. 
   - And the ten years? 
  - Skip married a cheerleader. 
   Cam and Bryce... 
  they did OK. 
   - And you? 
  - Check the Forbes list. 
   - Whoa... 
  - Forbes? 
   Why come back? 
   If it doesn't get what it wants from us,  it might target our families. 
   Besides, isn't it better to face our mistake where it all started  - than pretend it didn't happen? 
  - Dude,  I knew we had crazy in common. 
   Coach died, so I did research. 
   Black magic, Occult. 
   But I'm no expert at breaking a deal with the devil. 
   Not a deal. 
   You said a wish, right? 
   OK. 
   Did the demon emerge from a vessel? 
   - We were pretty high... 
  - The trophy. 
   Yes! 
  It could be a Marzaniok. 
   - Bringer of good and bad fortune. 
  - OK. 
   We'll split up, find the other two hockey bros  and bring them in to BBD. 
   Lure the Marzipan there and I'll shoot it before anyone else  can perform back-alley surgery on themselves. 
   Let's get this over with. 
   Wynonna. 
 
 
 
  Hold up. 
   We just go round and round, fighting demons. 
   Can't waste any more time on this... 
   - what's the Doc-ism? 
  Fool's errand? 
  - No, just the opposite. 
   This demon was brought forth from a vessel. 
   Should it return, it could be contained, kept alive. 
   Why, so it can con more people into shitty deals? 
   No, to save the person who got the shittiest deal of them all. 
   We catch this demon, Wynonna,  and we use it to save Deputy Marshall Dolls. 
   Lions and tigers and bears, oh sh1t. 
   You've been cooking drugs for Dolls? 
   He can no longer depend on Black Badge for his supply. 
   That's why you bought Shorty's? 
  All for him? 
   - Why didn't he ask... 
  - We are running out of time. 
   Suffice to say, there is an effort afoot to concoct what he needs,  which requires a demon's blood in its purest form. 
   If we catch and contain this Marzaniok, we can extract it. 
   Then... 
  let's get to not killing a demon. 
   - Word from your fellas? 
  - Skip's gone AWOL. 
   But it's not like Cam. 
   Some stones to turn over still. 
   Keep yer pecker up. 
  Hoo doggie. 
   Sheriff. 
   Might I inquire as to who's enjoying his final rest? 
   Sorry. 
   It's Cam. 
   He tore his own eyes out. 
   Dug so deep he hit brain matter, and then, well... 
   There there, compadre. 
   At this rate, you'll be broken enough for her in no time. 
   - You think that's funny? 
  - Not in the slightest. 
   - Skip's the only one left. 
  - Fret not,  an Earp is on the case. 
   Don't you worry, Cheryl. 
  I'll have Skip out lickety split. 
   Man. 
   Only a deal with a demon could land Skip a wife that stacked. 
   - Hi, Waverly. 
  - Jesus! 
  Tucker! 
   - Whew! 
  You startled me. 
  - I'm sorry. 
   I'd never want to cause you distress. 
   It's fine. 
  I have to go, OK? 
   You look so pretty when you smile. 
   - You should do it more often. 
  - Really, Tucker? 
   Okay, an I ask you something? 
   Maybe you could get your cop friend to treat me with more respect? 
   Officer Haught is my girlfriend. 
   You're confused. 
   That's impossible. 
  It'd just be wrong. 
   I'll show you wrong. 
   Hi, Doc! 
  Great news:  I know where Skip is! 
   Hey, team. 
   Everything on fleek? 
  Fleek city? 
   Super fleek? 
  Oh my God, Earp. 
   Uh, look, we need this so the luck of the 07's will rub off on us? 
   And you're kinda harshing our buzz here,  lunch lady. 
   Yeah, I'll serve your lunch. 
  Hand it over. 
   - Back off, Mom. 
  - Mom? 
  OK, OK. 
   Now I'm terrified for you. 
   Look, Charlie here spent 300 minutes in the penalty box this year. 
   Yeah? 
  You had me at 'box'. 
   What a crazy awesome bitch.

   Kicked some ass, did my part. 
  You? 
   Caught up with Cam a mite late, but located Skip. 
   - Is he safe? 
  - It ain't him we're worried about. 
   - I have to get out of here! 
  - You stole a vehicle  and ruined a perfectly good oak while under the influence. 
   That tree came right at me! 
   - Sure, Skip, OK. 
  - Officer, please. 
  It'll hurt my wife. 
   - Anyone near me. 
  - Look, dude,  the straw man argument is really not gonna work with me, so... 
   I'm sorry. 
   Skip, are you gonna puke? 
   Skip? 
   I come for what's mine. 
   - Hands on your head! 
  NOW. 
  - Move. 
  Or die. 
   I am a Purgatory Sheriff's Deputy,  and if you think you can come in here, in my office,  and mess with one of my citizens,  you are underestimating the day I've had! 
   We did not cover this at the Academy. 
   Are we too late? 
   You okay? 
   - I had him right where I wanted. 
  - Where is he? 
   Holed up. 
   Hey, Perry! 
   No! 
  You sure can pick 'em. 
   This has to end. 
   Please. 
  We didn't know what we were doing. 
   Perry! 
  Open the door! 
   - Let me in, dum-dum! 
  Where are the keys? 
  - I'VE GOT THIS! 
   - What are you doing? 
  - A spell. 
   In Old High German. 
  I think. 
   Where's Waverly when you need her? 
   I thought she was with you. 
   Gah! 
   Hey! 
  No! 
  Mm-mm! 
  Uh... 
   There's no place like home. 
   - I shall have my pound of flesh. 
  - Ah! 
   - Deal's off, homie. 
  - Wynonna... 
   Spare me  and I shall grant you what you most desire. 
  Anything. 
   Doc, there are other demons. 
   Ours is dang near out of time. 
   You know what I wish? 
   I wish you'd get back in the Goddamned trophy. 
   That was brave,  trying to reverse the spell. 
   Also stupid. 
   Brave but stupid. 
   I'll take it. 
   And alive. 
   Don't forget that. 
   It's not fair. 
   My teammates are dead. 
   We made mistakes, but we were all in it together. 
   You saved one. 
   Skip. 
   Tried to save the others. 
   Sometimes that's all we can do, right? 
   I guess your friend's right. 
   I'm not broken enough for you. 
   No, I'm the one who's broken. 
   Now go have a life. 
   Looks like you had a little trouble with the paperwork. 
   Look, I'll clean up the mess and file the report. 
   You wanna know how Purgatory really works? 
   OK. 
   Everyone pretends the whole Goddamn town isn't overrun by demons. 
   That's it? 
   That's the big secret? 
   The people who choose to live here, they want a simple life  in a small town with a shitty hockey team  and a view of the Rockies. 
   Some of us feel that that's worth  ignoring the occasional mermaid poltergeist. 
   OK, yeah, now I'm sure I've hit my head. 
   I sure hope not. 
   You graduated top of your class in the big city  and I need someone smart to take over when I retire. 
   You want me to be Sheriff? 
   Why do you think I worked so hard to recruit you? 
   Look, I know that Black Badge  seems like a hot sh1t covert operation... 
   And they don't have to wear khakis. 
   But who's gonna keep the drunks off the road? 
   Who'll referee the neighbourhood feuds? 
   Who will keep the ordinary,  everyday, non-werewolf citizens of Purgatory safe, Officer Haught? 
   We need more manpower, OK? 
   And we've gotta work with BBD and stop pretending  there's nothing paranormal going on around here. 
   OK. 
   You got permission to intervene in the wacky stuff when it's necessary. 
   The Lord knows they could use your instincts. 
   And the khakis? 
   They're a classic trouser. 
   Fine. 
   Fine. 
  Just be a good cop. 
   It matters. 
   Yeah. 
   Yes, it does. 
   And Nicole... 
   It's called a long game. 
   I've been playing one for a while. 
   She attacked me, Beth. 
   By the throat, like she had superhuman strength! 
   Waverly Earp? 
  She's a hundred pounds with both goody two shoes on. 
   I want to report her at the same time  we sue Officer Haught for assault. 
   We have to stick up for each other. 
   - We're Gardners. 
  - You're a directionless shut-in  and our brother is the town pervert. 
   - Mercedes! 
  - And as of now, that is going to stop. 
   What, like you're in charge? 
   You know, today I watched the same people  who've been making my friend Wynonna Earp's life miserable forever  finally get their asses kicked by her,  and it was glorious. 
   - If Mom and Dad were here... 
  - Well, they're not. 
   We'll not be suing Officer Haught, or Waverly. 
   Leave them alone, Tucker. 
  I mean it. 
   I'm not fighting your battles any more. 
  And neither is Beth. 
   If you die,  I don't have to wait until I turn 21  - to get my money. 
  - Super. 
   Until then, you're cut off. 
   - You can't! 
  - Watch me. 
   I hate you, Mercedes. 
   I hate you. 
   Yep. 
   It's time we pulled a Wynonna. 
   Did an about-face. 
   So the genie's back in the bottle? 
   Sack-face won't be rigging any more scrimmages. 
   But we need to know how to take him out. 
   Control him. 
  Draw his blood. 
   Translating the incantation as we speak. 
   Hey, Nicole was brave. 
   She took a beating trying to protect Skip. 
   - You guys OK? 
  - Of course. 
   - She's my best baby. 
  - Blech. 
   But also,  you're the best,  OK? 
  The bestest. 
  I just want her to remember that. 
   How about I remind her, huh? 
  Tonight. 
   Might help if you returned my lipstick, though. 
   I did. 
   - Really? 
  - I gave it to you. 
   Huh. 
   - I'll check again. 
  - 'K. 
   You sure you're OK? 
   Better put that somewhere safe. 
   OK, see you at home. 
   Where is it? 
  Clock's ticking. 
   I require assurances from you. 
   Like I have a choice? 
   Once released, ensure the creature is restrained  before you try and harvest what we need. 
   Do not look it in the eye, do not make any wish  and do not seek to use it to your advantage. 
   - You think I'm stupid? 
  - Problem is,  I know that you're not. 
   Holy Heisenberg,  what is all this? 
   Before Dolls' escape, I injected him with the last of his serum,  save for one iota. 
  My bartender here has been undertaking  the challenging task of trying to reverse engineer the formula. 
   We think Boobs McSeltzer can pull this off? 
   Her name is Rosita  and she has an advanced degree in Biochemistry. 
   Oh. 
   Well, maybe then I'll just shut up  and stop being such a superficial ass. 
   Why didn't you tell me any of this before? 
   Dolls made you promise not to. 
   Am I so garbage at life he couldn't even trust me? 
   It is a dangerous undertaking. 
   Should Lucado ascertain what we are doing here,  I'm the one Dolls can afford to lose. 
   But you still did it. 
   I ain't doing it for him. 
   You know, for a minute there,  I feared you might make a wish with the Marzaniok. 
   You could have wished away the curse. 
   I'm stubborn. 
  I always take the hard way. 
   Whereas I took the path too easy. 
   I am living... 
   and living, and living... 
   proof that it is not always prudent  - to strike deals with demons. 
  - Doc, we have. 
   In blood. 
   Black Badge owns us,  and if they find Dolls, they'll shoot him on sight. 
   Wynonna, I was supposed to make the drop two days ago. 
  It ain't ready. 
   But it's still possible. 
   - If we make it and Dolls can get here... 
  - No. 
   We need to get it to him. 
   He ain't coming back here. 
  Ever. 
   He's a damned fool if he does. 
   Wave... 
  Wave... 
   What are you doing? 
   Wave... 
   Wave... 
  Waverly!
