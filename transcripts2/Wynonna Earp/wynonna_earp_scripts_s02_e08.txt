 Previously on "Wynonna Earp"... 
   - Bobo moved the second seal. 
  - The seal is in Shorty's. 
   When the Earp heir turns 27,  those of us killed by the last one, we resurrect. 
   I put your boys back together. 
  You get me that lead. 
   - Tell me about the Earp Curse. 
  - Revenge for the death of our boys. 
   Then I threw you down a well. 
  Decades in the dark. 
   I can't end the curse unless I send every single revenant back to Hell. 
   Triangle's not only a prison. 
  It's also a sanctuary. 
   - For who? 
  - Not a "who."  A what. 
   (young Waverly): Willa, no! 
   Why is she so mean?

   (Waverly): When I fell through I was scared,  but I also, finally, understood. 
   That... 
  Willa had put Mr. 
  Rabbit out there,  knowing that the ice was thin. 
  That... 
   even if she was watching, she wouldn't pull me out. 
   That she hated me. 
   Now I know why. 
   I remember when you came home from the hospital, Wave. 
   I picked out your name myself. 
   You know they wanted to call you Welcome? 
   Welcome Earp, think about that! 
   God, I tried so hard,  but nobody ever celebrated my birthday,  or... 
  ordered copies of my school photos,  ...noticed my report cards. 
   Mama used to call you her angel. 
   Mama left. 
   And Daddy wouldn't even look at me. 
   I don't know. 
  Maybe because I wasn't his. 
   I didn't realize how hard it was for you. 
   But it doesn't mean you're not an Earp! 
   Come on,  or you're going to be late for your appointment. 
   - W... 
  Waverly! 
  - What? 
   Who did pull you out... 
  of the ice? 
   You did. 
   ♪♪  (Juan Carlo): Well now,  it's an awfully cold day to be stranded this far out of town. 
   What seems to be the trouble? 
   You are. 
   I put you and your sister in a box. 
   We got out. 
   So, Juan Carlo... 
  where is the last seal? 
   I'll die before I tell you. 
   Oh, Padre... 
  you'll do both.

  - Hmm! 
   Well, you can enjoy much more of it if you come upstairs. 
   Tempting. 
  Extremely tempting. 
   But I have an important errand I must attend to. 
   You don't have to explain yourself to me. 
   - I have my own plans. 
  - Do any of them  involve spending time with the Earp Sisters? 
   That could be problematic. 
   Wynonna is in my life, Rosita. 
  As are you, make no mistake. 
   But it would help if there wasn't a divide between my lover  - and my... 
  - Baby mama? 
  Alleged baby mama? 
   I was gonna say friend. 
   Wynonna is... 
  fun. 
   And Waverly, everybody loves Waverly!

   I thought we decided against that. 
   No, it's...

   A license plate off of a truck. 
   I'm aware of what a plate is, Deputy Marshal. 
   Juliet Zero Six, Hotel Five Echo. 
  Run it now. 
   (typing) 
   - Nothing. 
  - That's impossible.

  Well, try again! 
   Or we could try this:  did you catch a make? 
  Model?

   Black Dodge Ram, 2015, red neck screeching. 
   It was 2017, it was ebony, not black,  and that would've been Willie Nelson, so watch your mouth. 
   Rig belongs to Juan Carlo. 
   Juan Carlo. 
   - Juan Carlo kidnapped Wynonna. 
  - Highly doubt it. 
   He's more good Samaritan than he is dipshit. 
   Though we'll have to ask him why his plates aren't registered. 
   Listen, sheriff. 
  I need to find him. 
   Well, you know Juan Carlo. 
  He's kind of a wily one. 
   He's a loner. 
  And he's chief of the volunteer fire brigade. 
   Really helps to keep those young bucks in order. 
   Did you just say "the Order"? 
   - Nailed it. 
  - You're lucky nobody saw that. 
   You saw it. 
   Hey, well, I know why you are distracted. 
   Waves, Wynonna remembers you coming home from the hospital. 
   OK? 
  So who are you gonna trust more,  your sister or a sociopathic revenant in a fuzzy coat? 
   Well, I'm hoping I won't have to trust either. 
   I sent in a sample. 
   Results should show at the Cop Shop soon. 
   I didn't want them going to the Homestead,  - though it hardly matters now. 
  - Of course it matters. 
   - I haven't seen anything. 
  - OK. 
   I mean, besides, are you sure you really wanna know? 
   No! 
  But if I'm not an Earp, I have to. 
   In the meantime... 
   - why don't you distract me? 
  - Oh! 
   Just the ladies I'm looking for. 
   So, I had an idea. 
  About your sister. 
   I think we should throw her a baby shower. 
   - Seriously? 
  - I'll mix up some tequila  adjacent mocktails. 
  Hell, maybe even get a damn piñata. 
   Well, she does enjoy whacking things. 
   Henry mentioned that she's having trouble  seeing this baby as a blessing. 
   I just want to help. 
   You know Waves, that is not the craziest idea in the whole world. 
   And it'll show Wynonna that we're here for her, right? 
   "We"? 
   OK, so what's the cover for the... 
  surprise? 
   Nachos. 
   She'd never say no to nachos. 
   Girls-nothing-special nacho night it is. 
   I'll get on it. 
   OK. 
   Guess we're doing this. 
   We. 
  Huh. 
   (door opening) 
   You're not handcuffed. 
   Nedley said this was a courtesy call. 
   - Yeah, well, it's not. 
  - Right. 
  Uh... 
   - Juan Carlo kidnapped Wynonna. 
  - Oh. 
   Yeah. 
   Snatched her right out of the doctor's parking lot. 
   Do you have any idea why he would do that? 
   - Juan Carlo thinks Wynonna's special. 
  - Yeah. 
  She is. 
   Right. 
  Yeah. 
  uh... 
  I've also seen her fight before. 
   So, you know there's no way she goes with him  against her own will. 
   Besides, Juan Carlo is incapable of forcing anybody to do anything. 
   This is bad. 
  Ewan, right? 
   Really bad. 
  And it's only  going to get worse for you if you don't decide to help me. 
   - Oh.

  I got in a killer right hook.

   Prenatal vitamins, Dolls. 
  I feel like a mountain lion. 
   Are you OK? 
   Juan Carlo just has some things he wants to discuss with me. 
   Wynonna, where are you right now? 
   Uh... 
  We're at a cross-roads,  we've reached a communion... 
   Jesus Christ's country house! 
   That wasn't my best work. 
   Well, it was cute. 
   Still, I imagine it'll be hard even for Agent Dolls  to find this place. 
   Country house. 
  She's at a church. 
   Is he gonna creepy Vegas marry her or what?! 
   I have no idea. 
  Am I free to go now? 
  OK? 
   You really don't care about any of this, do you? 
   Wynonna, the seals, these aren't our fight. 
   The Order has been tasked to protect  the Ghost River Triangle from demons. 
  Period. 
   What the hell do you think my team and I  have been doing this entire time, huh? 
   Any word from Black Badge lately? 
   Eventually you and your boys  are going to have to get in the game, because neutral men  are the devil's allies.

   Wyatt said he'd return... 
   to see that all was set straight. 
   - How did you come by it? 
  - (Bobo scoffing) 
   The wound? 
   Your husband. 
   Clootie didn't need a gun. 
   Well, he held me as a shield,  in between him and Wyatt. 
   He was going to get away. 
   I told Wyatt to take the shot. 
   Bullet went straight through me and into the demon's heart. 
   You are a dear, brave friend. 
   Not dear enough. 
   "Robert,  My travels are delayed once more..."  - Doc Holliday's gone missing. 
  - Hmm. 
   Wyatt's gone looking for him instead. 
   Well, he does love John Henry, doesn't he? 
   - But to choose him over you...

   Doc saved Wyatt's life. 
   I just got in the way. 
   And gave up your soul. 
   What? 
   This isn't fair. 
  Don't tell him. 
   Didn't you hear my husband's last words? 
   That's what sent Wyatt Earp fleeing. 
   Clootie cursed him.

   You're lying. 
   She's not. 
   They'll resurrect upon Wyatt's death. 
   "Revenants" they'll be called. 
   To hound and kill  each and every Earp heir. 
   And round and round it goes... 
   Get out.

   The one that heals the dying and delays death interminably... 
   is also my seal. 
   And it's in the well? 
   Well, it seemed like a good place to hide it,  on the finger of the best gunslinger alive. 
   You rescue him,  get it back, avoid demon-dom... 
   And Doc and Wyatt will be reunited. 
   They'll be thrilled!

  I trust you'll make the right choice.
