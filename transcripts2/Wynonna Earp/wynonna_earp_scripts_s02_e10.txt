 Previously on Wynonna Earp. 
 You must warn Waverly and you take her away. 
 Where is the last seal? 
 - Do you swear? 
- I do. 
 But those things that look like Mercedes and Beth? 
 Aren't. 
 Demons took their place. 
 Ah! 
 - I'm with Nicole. 
- I'm with Doc. 
 Funny thing about being a revenant... 
 - He loved Waverly. 
- That's no excuse. 
 - Nicole! Stop! 
- The deed shall be done. 
 It is the law. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! 
 Get up in her face and make things right. 
 Waves? 
 Mercedes? God, your face! 
 Yeah, there's a lot of that going around. Rhah! 
 My husband, my lord, has illuminated the path and the path leads to you. 
 The law. 
 How foolish must the Earp wench feel... 
 ...knowing you had the seal. all this time. 
 Agh! 
 Please! I don't know anything about that or I would've told Wynonna! 
 You may not know you have it, it could be metal or precious and very, very old. 
 - I'm more of an IKEA kind of girl. 
- My lord does not make mistakes! 
 Get away from her, you bitch! 
 Pick on someone your own size. 
 Oh, that's cute. 
 Ah! 
 Neither of us know where the third seal is, Mercedes, but we are available for nose jobs. 
 Mercedes isn't here right now. 
You'll have to play with me. 
 No! 
 Waverly! 
 No! 
 Nicole! No! 
 You're telling the truth. You don't have it. 
 Well, that's embarrassing. 
 My husband's rings told the future. 
 The one who holds the seal is still coming here! 
 Oh my God! Baby! 
 Baby, stay with me. OK? 
 Shh. You're OK. Please don't die. 
 Shh, baby. Stay with me, OK? 
 OK? Shh. 
 Don't die, baby. Don't die! 
 Subtitles by explosiveskull 
 I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. 
 I'm talking Biblical, end of the world, 
 Deep Impact, Armageddon, 
 Season 19 of America's Next Top Model combined. 
 It usually is with you. 
 You're not gonna ask me why? 
 Nooo! It's questions like that that got Michael Bay into trouble. 
 Deep core drillers in space, come on. 
 I would like to know where the can is, though. 
 Thank you. 
 Kill 'em hard, Wynonna. 
 The town's had enough of this sh1t. 
 Can you believe not a single vending machine in this place sells candy? 
 My bladder's camping out in my lungs. 
 Get me some Goddamn Twizzlers! 
 God, you don't even know about the baby. 
 Well you are gonna be like, 
 "Of course you would get knocked up, you dumb ho." 
 I am so sorry, Mercedes. 
 She's malnourished. Lost a lot of blood. 
 And down a face, so... 
 I bet the doctors have questions. 
 Yeah, they're being handled. 
 You knew, the Gardner house. 
Something wasn't right. 
 There's nothing you could have done. 
 You saved her life. 
 Couldn't save the real Beth. 
 Beth might have been the lucky one. 
 They kept them alive like this. 
 Faceless. 
 For fun, for punishment. 
 For food. 
 I'm trying not to think about the reasons. 
 Only the retribution. 
 Well, I'm gonna find you some licorice... 
 if it kills me. 
 - OK. 
- Yeah. 
 Juan Carlo, the fire at the church... 
 Clootie's wives are kicking our ass. 
 Please, somebody help her! She's not breathing! 
 Stay with me, baby! Stay with me! You're going to be fine, OK? 
 - You're gonna be... 
- Step back, please. 
 Mattie? 
 - Gretta, bag her. 
- On it! 
 Oh. Her sister. 
 Get her into Trauma One, start an IV and get her vitals. 
 Miss, I need you to stay back here. 
 What? 
 Hey. 
 I'm here. Tell me everything. 
 I was on my way over, because we'd been fighting. 
 Oh God, she can't die while we're still fighting. 
 OK, I know it's hard. Just try to breathe. 
 I cheated on her. 
 Yeah. I'm a cheater. 
 Rosita. I kissed her. 
 OK, one kiss is not... 
 - Rosita is... 
- What, Doc's girlfriend? 
 Yeah. Oh, and a revenant. 
 Later... 
 So, Mercedes attacked Nicole. Why? 
 Widow Mercedes thought that Nicole had the third seal. 
 Not possible. 
 It's safe and sound, and it's the only thing keeping Clootie from resurrecting. 
 The Widows won't find it. Ever. 
 They can't. 
 You know where the third seal is, and you didn't tell me? 
 Nobody can know where it is but me. 
 - That way nobody gets hurt. 
- Nicole got hurt! 
 That's not what I meant. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Nicole was bitten because of me, Wynonna. 
 She saved me. 
 And now, I... 
 ...I need some air. 
 Mercedes bit her? 
 The Widows bit Juan Carlo. He was already dying when he kidnapped you. 
 Yeah, but Nicole is young and tough as hell. 
 Yeah, well Juan Carlo was a bullshit enchanted prophet. 
 It was still gruesome. He was in agony. This isn't a normal wound. 
 How long do you think she has? 
 Two, maybe three hours. 
 Well then we find or make or buy some kind of... anti-thing. 
 Anti-venom, like for a rattler bite. 
 - We can try. 
- No! 
 No. 
 They're not taking another one. Not today. 
 Whatever it takes, Dolls. 
 Oh God, this can't be happening. 
 This can't be happening. 
 This can't be happening. 
 Oh, but it is. 
 Beth. 
 No, not Beth. 
 Who are you, really? 
 What are you? 
 Hungry mostly. 
 And you smell... 
 ...rare. 
 Your sister attacked my girlfriend. 
 She's not really my sister. 
 She's more like my demon husband's other wife. 
 I don't care. 
 But I thought that we were bonding. 
 You can stay, or I can make you stay. 
 Mercedes thought that Nicole had the Stone Witch's seal. 
 Dumb bitch. 
 But she was right about one thing. 
 She got lucky when she bit Nicole instead of you. 
 Because now the heir's sister has motivation. 
 To help me. 
 - I would never. 
- Only I can cure her. 
 What? But the doctors are... 
 Human doctors! 
 How adorable are you? 
 Why don't you ask your marshal what happened to Juan Carlo? 
 Or, better yet, why don't you go take a look at his body for yourself? 
 See what our venom does to human flesh. 
 Tell me how to save her. 
 Oh, no. 
 Bullets can't kill us. 
 I admire your bravery, though! 
 I believe your sister knows where the last seal is. 
 Find it, give it to me and only me. 
 And I'll save your little lover's life. 
 I would never betray Wynonna. 
 Well, then I guess you better get to picking out a casket, say... yea-tall? 
 Hey! There you are. 
 Wynonna's in there with her. Hey, you alright? 
 - You're shaking. 
- Yeah, just cold. 
 What did the doctor say? 
 They can't identify what bit her, but I ordered a tox screen. 
 - What? But Dolls... 
- They want to induce a coma. 
 Slow the venom's move through her system. 
 But Nicole said that she won't go under until she... 
 ...sees you. 
 How's she doing? 
 Just... 
 Oh my God, it burns! Please make it stop! 
 Get her something for the pain. 
 Mercedes says... 
 ...the path leads to the law. 
 OK, shh. Save your strength, Haught. 
 - Wynonna, if this gets bad... 
- This ain't bad? 
 Just listen for once, Earp. OK? 
 I don't want to be a burden and I don't want a machine keeping my body alive. 
 And we both know Waverly's not gonna let me go. 
 Nicole, please don't ask me to do this. 
 You're the only one I can. 
 And you're the only one she's gonna forgive. 
 Please. Please! 
 OK. 
 You have my word. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm here. I'm here! 
 I'll go get the doctor. 
 Hey! 
 Shh. 
 You give Calamity Jane to Nedley, OK? 
 He is gonna pretend he doesn't want her, but he loves that damn cat. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 I am so sorry, Waverly, for everything. I made a h... I made a huge mistake. 
 No! Forget about the DNA results, OK? It doesn't matter. 
 Yes, it does. It does matter. 
 Especially now. 
 I just really thought I was doing the right thing, but I lied to you and I shouldn't have! 
 Hey. 
 I'm going to be here when you wake up, OK? 
 And we're gonna do all of our sorrys then, OK? 
 We're gonna have a big old sorry party and I'll make hats. 
 But if I don't... 
 No matter what happens, 
 I need you to know... 
 ...that I have never loved anyone the way that I love you. 
 Oh. 
 You know what? 
 Nope. 
 We're not doin' this. 
 We're gonna find... 
 We're gonna find a way to stop the toxin, OK? 
 You're gonna be just fine. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 Jeremy, is this everything you've got on the Widows? 
 Yeah. 
 OK. The effect of the poison was immediate. 
 But, uh... she could still move. 
 Yeah. My guess, it's the same toxin they spray as a paralyzing agent. 
 But in that case, the poison is inhaled. 
 Less concentrated. Different effect. 
 You mean instead of freezing you in place, it kills you? 
 Exactly! The Widows are basically super predators. 
 Like Komodo dragons... which are so cool. 
 sh1t. I am... I'm sorry. 
 No Jeremy. It's... it's fine. 
 Um, you know, Komodos are really cool. 
 OK, but this is good, right? I mean... 
 I mean, you've already been experimenting with the venom? 
 Well, creating a vapor guard against their mist, yeah. But... this is a whole different Quidditch game. 
 I don't need Star Trek references. I need you to tell me what to do. 
 Get more venom. 
 - Yeah. And a test subject. 
- I'll do it. 
 - No. 
- You're human. 
 The cure is worse than the poison. 
 It'll kill you like it's killing Nicole... 
 Damn it. Sensitivity training, Jeremy! 
 OK, everyone stop walking on eggshells. OK? 
 I know Nicole is dying and there's a really piss-poor chance that we're gonna save her, OK? But... 
 Can we all just act like we're.... 
 ...winning? For once. 
 Jesus, Jeremy how can you even work like... 
 Oh my God, your Optimug Prime! 
 Oh, it's OK. It's OK. It's not important. It's just a mug. 
 I'm basically a genius. I can fix it. 
 But what if you can't? 
 - Wynonna, what if he can't? 
- He can. 
 We will. 
 This third seal. 
 Constance's seal. Is it worth all of this? 
 OK... 
 Maybe we could use it to lure the Widows? 
 We all love Nicole, baby girl. 
 And there is no way in hell that she is dying today. 
 Do you trust me? 
 Trust... us? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Do what you can with the last of the veil juice. 
 Let me worry about a test subject. 
 Yeah, and I'll speak to Ewan and his jokers in The Order. 
 They know Juan Carlo. Juan Carlo knows the Widows. 
 Yeah, and in that case, they bit him, meaning his body's pumped full of venom. Might also help. Gross as that sounds. 
 Man, I've seen you eat. 
I don't get grossed out. 
 OK, what about us? 
 You stay near your girl. 
 We need updates. Timelines. 
 You've already done a lot. 
 Alright? Faux-cedes is injured, thanks to you. 
 That means we can track her from Nicole's apartment. 
 OK. Who's "we"? 
 He's a pain in my ass these days, but damn it... Doc could find a dildo in a nunnery. 
 You want venom? 
 We will find her. And when we do... 
 ...I'm gonna milk that bitch like a snake. 
 Doc Holliday... 
 ...the greatest kong artist ever. 
 Did you say "kong artist"? 
 Reduced to a pair of fours. 
 Just playin' the cards I've been dealt. 
 Mhm. 
 Full house. 
 Lose three hands and you're out? 
 Well, suit yourselves! 
 Ah, it's not like they have forever to win it back. 
 Hey, Rosie! 
 You're not supposed to be here, Stevie. 
 Ooh! 
 You looking for trouble? 
 Just a decent poker game. 
 I used to work here. For Bobo. 
 Ha ha ha ha! Yeah. Bobo. 
 Oh, easy to laugh, I guess, now that he's dead. 
 Get you a fresh one? 
 Downstairs, right? 
 Sit tight. 
 Let's play another hand. 
 - A few cards short. 
- High card draw. 
 I win and you tell me why you're so interested in poking around in my basement. 
 Hmm. You lose? 
 We'll get you another bottle. 
 Woohoo! 
 Whoa! Smells like Doritos and feet. 
 You been here all night? 
 It's the heir! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 The bar is closed. 
 Private game to which I was about to win big. 
 I didn't know you were still hangin' with my mortal enemies. 
 Oh, well, one of us is mortal and it ain't him. 
 I wasn't expecting you to be cool about it, but the pouting is getting old. 
 We are born to die. 
 And once the seal I gave you serves its purpose... it will all be worth it. But if you came here to try and convince me to cover your back as you try and confront murderous demon brides, I'm gonna have to sleep this off first. 
 Nicole is dying. They bit her. 
 Lead the way. 
 Bring your knives too. 
 I'll get the coffee. 
 Hm. 
 Go. 
 Jesus! 
 If you're trying to pass for a normal human, maybe don't jump women in broad daylight. 
 I just came to play Let's Make a Deal. 
 Did you get it? 
 - I don't know where it is. 
- You're a clever girl. 
 - Find it. 
- Yes, I am clever. 
 I know I can't trust you. 
 I know that breaking the final seal will unleash... 
 My husband Clootie? 
 So what? Your family is already in hell, always in constant danger. 
 And you're about to lose your girlfriend. 
 But salvation... is just a drop away. 
 Or not. 
 We've put down demons, witches, even Bobo Del Rey. 
 You'll join them in the ground soon enough. 
 Nicole will get there first. 
 Ta ta for now. 
 - Wait! 
- Waverly! Hold up. 
 You got the key to Nicole's place, right? 
 - Yeah. 
- I gotta pick up that mongrel cat of hers. 
 Well, if you hate it that much, I'll take Calamity Jane. 
 No, Randy Nedley's a man of his word. 
 And I got her a new scratching post. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Ahh. 
 Chin up. 
 Officer Haught's the strongest deputy I've ever had. 
 Look, I know that you two are, um... you're, uh... but, you know, procedure says I had to call Nicole's next of kin. 
 But she doesn't speak to her parents. 
 Neither did I. 
 Oh. Hey. Hey. 
 You're a doctor? 
 Actually, yes. 
 Ah... and you are? 
 I'm Waverly. 
 How is she doing? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 Oh, uh, sorry. I'm not her doctor. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 I'm Shae. 
 Nice to meet you. Are you a friend of Nicole's? 
 Sort of. 
 I'm her wife. 
 Ewan! 
 Tell me that wasn't Juan Carlo. 
 We don't usually invite outsiders to our cremation ceremonies. 
 He might have had trace amounts of the Widows' poison in his system. 
 As did the other three we just turned to ash. 
 Oh, wow. 
 This just gets worse and worse, huh? 
 We needed that venom. 
 They needed a proper burial for their bravery and service. 
 We are all that's left of The Order. 
 Bummer. 
 Well, have a nice bonfire. 
 There's other things we can offer. 
 Oh, really? I highly doubt that. 
 The baby. The heir to come. 
 It needs to be kept safe. 
 We'd be willing to take the little one in. 
 - You let us handle that, alright? 
- Others are coming for it. 
 Demons. People from dangerous cults. 
 Like the one you used to work for. 
 Black Badge is a secret intelligence organization. 
 They may be misguided, but they are not baby-snatching crazies. 
 You were taken. Weren't you? 
 The point is, the child must be protected. 
 So what, you care about the Earps all of a sudden? 
 I care about not getting cremated anytime soon. 
 We can't beat the Widows. 
 But there's a chance you all might be able to, with the right weapon. 
 You mean the one you took from us? 
 - Negotiated for. 
- Ah. 
 Come. 
 It's in the big red truck. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 An act of faith. 
 We could all use some, right about now. 
 Thanks. 
 But I'll take my chances with science. 
 We're doing everything we can. 
 Almost. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I talked to the toxicology specialist. 
 They're still trying to ID the poison. 
 You called it in, right? 
 You were with her when it happened? 
 Yeah... 
 I found her. 
 She'd already been bitten... or... something, I don't know. 
 So, how did you guys meet? 
 Uh... 
 Rock climbing in Nevada. 
 Not far from Vegas. 
 Oh. 
 - ...oh! 
- Yeah. 
 We got married in a fever. 
 Britney Live and a big win at the slot machines will do that to you. 
 But then... things cooled off. 
 What's going on? 
 She's waking up. 
 - She needs something stronger. 
- Nicole, can you hear me? 
 It's burning! 
 Any known allergies to anaesthetics? 
 - No. 
- Yes. 
 Thiopental could kill her. Give her Propofol. 
 Rock climbing incident. She needed surgery. 
 Kinda ruined our honeymoon. 
 Right. 
 - I didn't know. 
- How could you? 
 Oh God, I'm just making this worse. 
 Black and chunky, just how he likes it. 
 There it is. 
 I trust Doc. It must've been Dolls. 
 Waverly. 
 Am I the only one who didn't know? 
 Did she also tell you that I saved her from becoming Tucker's personal Kimmy Schmidt? 
 She's distracted... 
 ...watching the love of her life die a painful death. 
 I heard. 
 If there's anything that I can do... 
 All set. Vamonos. 
 Doc? 
 Can you bring the truck to the front door? 
 Preggo card. 
 Every step is like an adventure in discomfort. 
 Miracle of life, my ass. 
 The bar is closed today. 
 You can take the day off. 
 Ahem. 
 So... should I pack my bags now? 
 Or is this it, right here, right now? 
 You want to help? Haul ass over to BBD. 
 We got an anti-venom needs testing. 
 You don't think Jeremy can handle it? 
 Yeah, I do. He's a scientist. 
 But he lacks certain skills... 
 ...like not dying. 
 It's a good deal. 
 When this is done, Nicole makes it... 
 ...I'll shoot you last. 
 I appreciate everything you've done. 
 I even like you, but... 
 - ...Nicole needs us. 
- Yeah. I know. 
 So you don't have to threaten me. All you have to do is ask. 
 - Hey. 
- Hey. 
 Thought I'd stop by on my way to the office. 
 How is she? 
 Oh, Dolls... 
 Alright. It's OK. 
 Who's that? 
 It's just, uh... another doctor. 
 So... did you find The Order? Get anything from Juan Carlo? 
 Yeah, something, but... 
 Well, I should probably get going now. 
 Wait. 
 Can I come with? 
 I'm useless here. 
 Awesome! OK, this formula is killing me. 
 Did they send your big brain over to help? 
 Hm... 
 My body, actually. 
 - Nobody cares about your body. 
- Yeah, I'm starting to get that. 
 Attempt number one at the anti-venom. 
 Need a test subject. Wynonna said she'd figure it out. 
 I'm not here for the snacks. 
 I'm your guinea pig. 
 What? No! No, hey! 
 I know you're not strictly like us, but you're one of us. And this stuff could kill you! 
 You know damn well there's only one thing that can kill me. 
 Hey, hey, Rosita! Come on, I'm gonna have to have you stop... 
 Please, this is not what I signed up for! 
 Some of us don't have a choice. 
 Your girls gave Mercedes a hell of a fight. 
 Not hellish enough. 
 I saw Peacemaker on the bar. 
 Tell you anything? 
 Just that you've been keeping a supernaturally well-endowed secret from me for a very long time. 
 I'm sure you can understand why. 
 And I assume she is now helping to perfect the anti-venom? 
 Do you have a better idea? 
 She can't die, Doc. Not from that. 
 Oh, but she still can feel the pain. 
 They all can. 
 It's too fresh to have come from Nicole. 
 I'd say less than an hour. 
 Calamity Jane, you minx. 
 I almost sent you to Hell, cat. 
 Nedley forget about you? 
 Maybe he didn't. 
 - Nicole's hat? 
- She is barely a seven. 
 This here's a seven and three-quarters. 
 In Wynonna terms? 
 The owner of this hat has got a big damn head. 
 Waverly said Mercedes was mumbling about being in the right place, wrong time. 
 Bitch came back, didn't she? 
 She's got Nedley. 
 The rings pointed me to the law. 
 I was sure it was the other one. 
 Nicole is close with the heir, and... 
 You, though. 
 You're nobody. 
 I am skip of the Purgatory Poachers, county curling champions for the past six years in a row. 
 Perhaps they'll bury you with your trophies. 
 Now tell me where the seal is, and your death will be quick. 
 We got no seals here. We got elk. 
 We got pronghorn. We got plenty of loons. 
 Or I can keep you alive for weeks. 
 And in the most glorious pain. 
 That sounds kind of kinky. Are you sure you're not the real Mercedes? 
 Would it have killed you to add a little morphine to the mixture? 
 We're getting closer. 
We could take a break. 
 No, don't! Just... 
 
 
 
 - Jeremy, stop! 
- Hey, it's not me! 
 Rosie insisted because Wynonna insisted. Who I'm not blaming, because someone has to test the anti-venom, but this is total bullshit and makes me feel like horfing. 
 Yeah, it should. This is not who we are. 
 Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. Hey. It's the only way we have to save Nicole, OK? 
 No. It's not. 
 - Yes. 
- It's not. 
 Beth-face Widow came to me. 
 She offered to save Nicole... as long as I give her the third seal. 
 - Did you? 
- No, of course not! 
 OK. Good. 'Cause that seal is the only thing preventing the Widows from unleashing MegaDemon3000. 
 Yeah. I got it. 
 But Nicole's running out of time. 
 And if this experiment isn't working, then... 
 What if you did? 
 What? 
 I mean, you'd do anything for the woman you love, right? 
 - Dolls? 
- So what if you made the deal and gave... 
 Beth the third seal. 
 And she actually followed through and saved Nicole. 
 When they raise their dead demon husband, she would be there to help us put him back where he belongs. 
 After everything Wynonna's done to get that seal... how could I? 
 You can say I made you. 
 I ordered you. 
 I don't even know where it is. 
 Yeah. Neither do I. 
 Jeremy... 
 ...think outside the box. 
 - That's what she said. 
- That's what she. 
 Dolls, no. What are you... 
 What's the point of being different if you can't use it. Right? 
 Hook me up. We got a ginger to save, boy. Let's go! 
 What the hell is taking Doc and Wynonna so long? 
 I, um... I should go and see Nicole one last... 
 ...one more time. 
 - Alright. 
- Hey. 
 Hm? 
 I'll never forget this. 
 Ready? 
 You can end this. 
 Tell me where to find the seal, and the pain stops. 
 So... Tucker was just a toadie. 
 What are you, a witch? A Pokémon? 
 You think this is my first demon rodeo? 
 You know, we had an actual demon rodeo? 
 Tell me!!! 
 You know, lady, this is a day at the beach compared to Wynonna Earp on my case for eternity over any beans I spill. 
 When we raise our lord and master, we will sacrifice your pathetic body at the altar of his tomb. 
 You know, the only altar this boy bows to is the bar stool on hockey Saturday. 
 Where's yours? 
 In the house of my enemy. 
 In a place of worship. 
 And you will lead me to the seal that opens it. 
 I tire of this. 
 After, we do the toes. 
 The iron count in her blood is too high. 
 Her organs are shutting down. 
 There's gotta be something else. 
 They pumped her full of Deferoxamine, but she's not responding. 
 I've got everyone working on this. 
 I read her tox screen. It doesn't even make any sense. 
 What exactly do you people do? 
 I tried to keep her out of danger. 
 Well, if you thought that'd work, you don't know her at all. 
 Right. 
 Hey... 
 What we had was fun, it was great, but it wasn't real. 
 But you. 
 She really loves you, Waverly Earp. 
 We have to save her. 
 There's nothing anyone can do... unless you have a miracle up your sleeve? 
 The doctor told me that if she wakes up again, 
 I should say my goodbyes. 
 I'm not saying goodbye. 
 Gretta! Gretta... 
 I'm sorry, this isn't my floor. 
 I knew your sister. 
 I don't have a sister. 
 You did. 
 A twin. 
 Mattie the Blacksmith. 
 And I've heard rumours about you, too. 
 The Iron Witch. 
 I know who you are. 
 Don't presume to know me just because you saw my sister die. 
 Please. 
 I need your help. 
 My love, she... she's got iron in her veins. 
 - OK? She was... 
- Bitten? 
 By something not of this world? 
 Yeah. A demon. 
 Did you see this demon? 
 A widow in black that can levitate and steal faces. 
 Not just one. 
 You know them? 
 There was a story my great grandmother used to tell. 
 Two twisted spider sisters. 
 They'd attack pretty girls. Ate them whole, but for their faces. 
 These, they wore as masks to lure the girl's remaining family members, one by one, to their death. 
 Yeah, well, they're real. 
 And it's not just my family they're after. 
 Your great grandmother, did she... know how to save someone who was bitten? 
 An anti-venom? 
 Maybe... Yes. 
 Yes, I could get this for you. 
 But my price will be steep. 
 Whatever it takes. 
 You make a promise to an Iron Witch, it's binding. 
 I get anything I want. 
 You have my word. 
 Wo ist die antwort auf dieses leben. 
 You will find a cure for what ails your love in here. 
 Thank you. 
 Is this a joke? 
 Doc... 
 Doc's ring? 
 He never takes this off. 
 Unless... 
 The Widows have rings too. 
 The cure for what ails my love. 
 The third seal. 
 OK, well don't push yourself too hard, alright? 
 As soon as we find her toxic ass we'll bring her in, OK? 
 Doc, we gotta speed this sh1t up. 
 Dolls just signed up for testing. 
 There are a couple more drops of blood here. 
 Wynonna? 
 God, I could use a drink. 
 Focus, woman. 
 These branches are snapped sideways. 
 They're movin' this way. 
 There's no more footprints. 
 Well, don't forget the freak is a floater. 
 Well, if she's carrying the sheriff, she won't get very far. 
 Looks like it hasn't been touched in years. 
 Why is the snow brushed off the door handle? 
 If I didn't know any better, I'd swear you were trying to get me pregnant again. 
 My tracking skills are quite virile. 
 Save some for the fight. Let's go. 
 Hold on. 
 What are the chances you will sit this one out and allow me? 
 Somewhere between shut up and stick it. 
 These harpies that killed Juan Carlo, they put Officer Haught on her death bed. 
 You are not just lookin' out for your own life these days. 
 Noted. 
 I promise to stay... 
 ...in the driver's seat. 
 This is just the beginning. 
 You have so many places to slice. 
 So, just tell me. 
 Where is the seal? 
 Have you tried up your own ass? 
 She is not coming for you. 
 Wynonna Earp doesn't care about anyone but herself! 
 Give me my seal! 
 Give me my Nedley! 
 That was for Ms. Haught. 
 Is she dead yet? 
 This one's for Waverly. 
 Nobody tortures the Sheriff but me. 
 You don't get to win! 
 Toy guns. 
 Earp guns. You already tried 'em all. 
 - It won't kill me. 
- Who said I was gonna kill you? 
 Doc, do me a favour and hogtie this animal. 
 Do you want a reef knot or a bowline? 
 I never broke. Never told her a thing. 
 Why do you think I chose you to hold the ring? 
 Yeah. It's safe and sound in my coffee cup at the station. 
 You hid it where now? 
 Oh, everyone knows better than to touch Randy Nedley's mug. 
 - Yeah, I'm gonna need it back. 
- That's probably best. 
 Yeah. 
 Also, I think I need to go to the hospital. 
 Hey. 
 You did good. 
 Jeremy?! We got a live one! 
 Oh, Clarice! The lambs'll be screaming for months! 
 Where's Dolls and Rosita? 
 Oh, you mean lab rats number one and two? 
 Testing took a lot out of them. 
They're resting in the holding cells. 
 Who's blaming who can be sorted out later. 
 Bit of a time crunch here. 
 Oh, yeah. We will talk about it, Wynonna. 
The venom should be in her glands. 
 To get it out, you'll need this. 
 - You want me to? 
- You kidding?! 
 I've been looking forward to this all day. 
 Waverly?! I've got the best news! 
 Haught, damn, you made it! 
 OK, just still not 100%, so maybe less squeezing? 
 Yeah. 
 - How? 
- Nobody knows. 
 I... I woke up and I felt completely fine. 
 It's a miracle. 
 It's something. 
 I told you to wait. 
 I gave you my word I'd...get a cure and I did. 
 Waverly... 
 ...what did you do? 
 Well... 
 ...you look unhappy. 
 Maybe you didn't love Nicole Haught after all. 
 How dare you. 
 You said you'd point me to the anti-venom! 
 No. I said I could get you the anti-venom. 
 Oh. 
 That was a dirty trick. 
 Is she not cured? 
 Wynonna will never forgive me! 
 - Nicole? Waverly? 
- Fine, and not fine. 
 In neck deep sh1t when I find her, actually. 
 The cure didn't work? 
 I said, Nicole's fine. 
 It's all going down. 
 The Widows have the third seal. 
 Wow. Waverly did it. 
 She found it. 
 You knew? 
 That. 
 Oh, no. No way. 
 You told me to name my price. 
 This is it, Earp. 
 You know, you make a wish on that thing, you're gonna regret it in 10 years. 
 I'm aware of the cost. 
 You'd have done the same thing. 
 No! I would have trusted my people to find a cure, which we did, instead of handing over an apocalyptic piece of jewelry to our enemies! 
 Now we get ready to fight. 
 Even Peacemaker can't put these bitches down. 
 About that. I might have something. 
 I got a frantic text message from Wynonna, said you'd run off... 
 The Blacksmith? 
 Her sister. 
 Gretta. 
 She helped me with something. 
 "Disappear." 
 Waverly, why is she jabbering in German? 
 I don't know. 
 ...Wynonna Earp 
 Let go of that trophy. 
 The Order, they call it a weapon. 
 The Order needs to stop talking in riddles. 
 What kind of metal is this? 
 Stop. 
 - Now. 
- I changed my mind, OK? 
 No deal. No deal! 
 Hands off that trophy, witch! 
 No! 
 What did you do? 
 Sorry about Holliday. 
 Chalk it up to collateral damage. 
 You two Earp girls. 
 You got my sister killed. Now this is your punishment. 
 One will disappear. 
 The other will have to live with it! 
 No. No. 
 No! Undo it! 
 No! 
 Wynonna! 
 I know what we need to do... 
 What the... 
 Doc? Doc?! 
 Wynonna! 
 Waves? Are you OK? 
 Hey, did you hear shrieking? 
 Yeah, from your mouth, silly. 
 Who's Wynonna? 
 I have no idea. 
 Hey, come on. 
 We've got a wedding to plan! 
 Not again. 
 Wynonna! 
 Wynonna!
