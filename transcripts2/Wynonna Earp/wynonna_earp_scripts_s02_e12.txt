 Previously on Wynonna Earp. 
   The universe has never given me a choice  about whether I wanted to be the heir or a mother. 
   - Doc might not be the dad. 
  - Then who is? 
   - You don't have s*x with a revenant. 
  - I'm your kid's father. 
   My DNA test. 
  I'm not a child, Nicole! 
   From the look on your face, I'm not an Earp either. 
   The Order, they call it a weapon. 
   - Wynonna... 
  - I know how to get her back! 
   - Who?! 
  - Wynonna! 
   (Bobo): I will not and cannot go back to Hell. 
   Old Clootie has the power to make sure I never do. 
   They broke it. 
  Now we're all gonna buy it. 
  Not now. 
  Please! 
  Oh... 
   - (Eerie music) 
  - Bobo Del Rey! 
   You do not get to do this. 
   You do not get to win! 
   Move her, or I will. 
   I mean it! 
  Stand down, you sh1t strumpets. 
   And you. 
  That is a woman's coat! 
   Ouch. 
  New, gay Waverly's  a little judgey, though I like the new sass... 
  and how  - you betrayed your sister. 
  - You won't hurt me. 
   I won't help you, either. 
   Giving a sh1t  about you has only caused me pain. 
   No one said parenthood was easy. 
   It's time to grow up,  little girl. 
   - (Waverly gasping) 
  - No more  growing up for Waverly. 
   - She's cooked. 
  - (gunfire) 
   - Wynonna! 
  - All I smell is fried bride. 
   Oh, look, sister! 
  An Earp-a-tizer for both of us. 
   - Robert Svane. 
  - Gestating Bitch. 
   Not so into angels anymore then, Bobo? 
   Let's just say, I got sick of betting on the losing team. 
   Why are you back? 
   How many times do I have to put you in the ground? 
   - (gunshot reverberating) 
  - Your bullets are useless  against us.

  But...

   Missed you.

   Oh, during the vision quest, I kinda died.

  There are multiple couches right over there! 
   You never were much for tradition. 
   And I guess our baby won't get the chance to learn ours. 
   Nicole told you the plan. 
  It's the only chance we have  to keep it safe. 
  That's all that matters. 
   It matters that you didn't ask me. 
  I could've helped! 
   You are helping, cutie. 
   And I w... 
   I wanted to wait as long as possible  to break your heart. 
  Besides, we don't know if you  can even leave the Ghost River Triangle. 
  Cross the line. 
   What? 
  How long have you known? 
   After my vision quest... 
  I suspected. 
   Seeing Bobo... 
   Robert Svane, as he was... 
   he's your father, isn't he? 
   I honestly don't know anymore. 
  What would that make me? 
   - Daughter of an asshole. 
  Join the club. 
   OK? 
  You're still you, Waverly. 
   - And if this baby is Jonas'... 
  - (Wynonna groaning) 
   half-revenant, then I guess... 
  I guess it won't be able  to get out either. 
   Waverly! 
  What the hell?! 
   (screaming) 
   (gasping) 
   Well, that was very emotional...  - and annoying. 
  - Rosita! 
   - Don't do this, please! 
  - It's done. 
  And so am I. 
   Done with your judgments, your holier-than-thou attitude. 
   Your "I'll shoot you last, Rosita". 
   - I made a mistake. 
  - Well, so did I,  thinking an Earp would be anything but my enemy. 
   - No! 
  - Your baby is currency,  Wynonna. 
  The revenants, the Order, Black Badge... 
   let's just say that... 
  there are endless men  that would kill to get their hands on it. 
   - (Wynonna groaning) 
  - Guarantee me safe passage. 
   You crazy traitor bitch! 
   What does it matter? 
  You're not even keeping it anyway! 
   Because I care more about this than anything else in the world! 
   I promise to get it out of you. 
   Look, I promise it will survive. 
   As for the mother...

   Oh...

   The demon Clootie. 
   His hellfire name is Bulshar. 
   And... 
  he is free. 
   Well, not for long. 
   - We killed his demon brides. 
  - He shall have a new bride. 
   Someone who's... 
   pure. 
   I pledged him my angel.

  It's fairly bad etiquette to kill someone  after you've had your... 
  your fingers up their vag. 
   I'll be sure to embroider that on a throw pillow  - in your memory. 
  - What about Doc? 
   He doesn't love me. 
   - He does, in his way - When you disappeared,  I saw what he was without you. 
 
 
 
  Hard... 
  cruel. 
   Sounds like a match made in heaven. 
   You don't know me at all. 
   I know you're the type of woman who made this about a guy.

   I know it won't matter  'cause I'll never stop hunting you.
