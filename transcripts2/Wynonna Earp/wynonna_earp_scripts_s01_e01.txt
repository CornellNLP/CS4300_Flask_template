 How did it go? 
 That bathroom's a crime against humanity. 
 Trust me. Put down the coffee. 
 It's gone cold anyways. 
 Never gone this long between hipster coffee shops. 
 First time out west? 
 Next stop's mine. 
 You live here? 
 No, not anymore. 
 Funeral. 
 My uncle's. 
 I'm Kiersten. 
 What'd you say your name was again? 
 There's so many of them! 
 You said they can't attack the house! 
 They figured out how to get around the bedrock! 
 girl : I got the gun, Daddy. 
 Let's close our eyes and sing Mama's lullaby. 
 Just until the bad guys go away. 
 (girl screaming) 
 DADDY! 
 (Bang!) 
 (flat tire rolling) 
 Oh, Christ! 
 That's it, I'm gonna burst. 
 (sigh) 
 No. 
 Time to introduce Chestnut Latte to the badlands. 
 Kiersten... don't go out there. 
 Why? 
 It's dark. 
 Pretty and smart. 
 We're gonna get along just fine.

 man : Did you hear that? 
 woman : Yeah. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 man : Whoa! 
 Hello? 
 (creature roaring) 
 (roaring) 
 What's going on? 
 Sit down. 
 Everyone, sit down. We're leaving. 
 (bestial roaring) 
 I've heard this before. 
 Wolves? 
 Something's outside. 
 Yeah, a passenger! 
 (screaming) 
 (Kiersten screaming) 
 We have to do something! 
 Yeah, drive! 
 Come on! 
 We can't just leave her! 
 driver : You'd have to be nuts to go out there. 
 Let's go! 
 Come on! 
 ♪ 
 Assholes! 
 Hey! 
 If you hurt her, I'll kill you! 
 (bestial roaring) 
 Kiersten? 
 Let her go! We're armed!

 My name?

 Nope.

 (sigh) 
 Curtis was not a handsome man. 
 When I first lay eyes on him at the cookout, I said to my sister, "Just how closely related are his parents"? 
 (some people chuckling) 
 But he was loyal. 
 Traits folk nowadays might find old-fashioned... boring. 
 Thing is, with Curtis, I was never bored. 
 Not once. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 What are you doing here? 
 ♪ Salt of the earth ♪ 
 You're late, as usual. 
 I'm so sorry, Gus. 
 I thought you were in Spain. 
 Greece, when I heard. 
 Listen, I know Purgatory's country and all, but is that legal to bury your husband in the garden? 
 (Wynonna chuckling) 
 Only thing Curtis loved more than me was his tomatoes. 
 Who am I to separate soul mates? 
 They said it was a stroke. 
 Bullshit! 
 He was still tossing hay bales like a teenager. 
 Champ was... with him, but he didn't see what happened. 
 Hardy "Rodeo Champ" Champ? 
 Yeah. He's a good kid. 
 Gus, when they found Curtis, was he still... intact? 
 Wynonna! 
 I just want to find out what happened. 
 He died. 
 Please, Wynonna, let it go. 
 For once. 
 It was a really nice eulogy. 
 Runaway? Whore? 
 Who knows what kind of trouble this girl got herself into? 
 Spoken like a man who finds a lot of dead girls. 
 And you've had three of 'em in the past six months. 
 (camera click) 
 So you find... 
 "Kiersten's" head yet? 
 Which agency did you say you were from? 
 See those skid marks? 
 This isn't the kill site. 
 Driver said two of 'em got off the bus. 
 OK, so where's the other body? 
 And these lacerations... defensive wounds? 
 Bite marks... from scavengers. 
 We have an overpopulation of coyotes this summer. 
 Winter will thin out the pack. You plan to be here that long, Mr... ? 
 Dolls. 
 Deputy Marshal Dolls. 
 And I'll be here as long as it takes. 
 Well, then welcome to the bustling metropolis of Purgatory where nothing lives but cattle and cowboys. 
 And maybe... the occasional Greek goddess. 
 What'll I tell the locals happened out here? 
 Runaway hooker. Coyote attack.

 (rock song  Brass Tracks  playing softly in the background) 
 Well, either I'm sucking fumes out of the back of Willie Nelson's tour bus or Wynonna Earp just walked into my bar. 
 Hey, Shorty. How's business? 
 Mechanical bull broke a month ago. 
 Chippendales' night was a bust. 
 Not to mention this sh1t about a dead runaway. 
 Rule number 1: You never get off the bus. 
 I did. 
 You were there? 
 Did you tell the cops? 
 Why I'm here. Phoned it in anonymously. 
 Uh-huh... 
 Two stints in juvie, a summer riding with the Banditos, and I'm still wanted for questioning in the Bleaker case. 
 My relationship with law enforcement  es un poco  complicated. 
 How about  un poco  of liquid courage? 
 Alright, just one, yeah. 
 I gotta focus. I'm here for Gus, and Curtis. 
 Somebody knows what really happened to my uncle. 
 man : Where have you been, Wynonna? 
 As far from here as I could get. 
 Lucky you. 
 If I could leave Purgatory, I'd never come back. 
 Why would Wyatt Earp choose to settle in this shithole? 
 My money's on the deep genepool. 
 Well, maybe your great-great-grandpappy got a few lucky shots in at the OK Corral and fled before they found out he was a fraud. 
 Didn't he marry a whore? 
 An actress. 
 Oh, oh, sh1t! 
 She's probably the one who gave Doug Holliday the clap that done him in. 
 Hahaha! 
 Doc! Doc Holliday, dumb-ass. 
 And it was tuberculosis that killed him, you ignoramus. 
 This coming from the pair of tits so insane, so cursed? 
 What did you say? 
 Getting beat up by a girl again, Carl? 
 Champ! 
 My hero. 
 Sweet. 
 Listen, uh, I was hoping I could talk to you... about what happened to my uncle. 
 Bring those lips, we can, uh, "talk" all night long. 
 You didn't pay me a second glance in high school. 
 Hey, you were kind of a freak. 
 You have no idea. 
 Well... 
 Shorty lets you stay above the bar, huh? 
 Yeah, I, uh... got a key. 
 Oh... it's impressive. 
 Ooof.. 
 So, ummm... 
 You ran ranch security with Curtis, but didn't bother to make his service? 
 Yeah, I, uh, hate funerals.- Ugh! Tell me about it. 
 Gus mentioned you were the one who found his body. 
 Yeah. Speaking of bodies... 
 Hmm? 
 Mad hot. 
 (Wynonna chuckling) 
 Alright, Champ. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe it wasn't such a good idea. 
 Do you know what time it is? 
 Yeah. 
 Time for you to tell me how Curtis died. 
 He.. he just did! 
 Oh no. Don't make me get rough! 
 This ain't rough? 
 Look, uh, I heard screaming and screaming, and I ran. 
 Called the Sheriff. 
 And when they found him, his head had been torn clean off! 
 (Champ moaning) 
 Listen, you washed-up rodeo clown. 
 Who did it? 
 What did you see? 
 Cattle mutilations, lights in the hills, strange marks in the dirt. 
 Owww! 
 He died on your land, Wynonna! 
 (Champ panting) 
 The homestead? 
 Show me where. 
 I'm not going back there. 
 You're in this with me now, "Champ." 
 And no one else is gonna save you. 
 Oh! Except his girlfriend, you skank! 
 Why don't you slip into something more comfy, huh? 
 Like a coma! 
 Worst birthday ever! 
 Wynonna? 
 Hey, sis. 
 You grew out your... hair. 
 Did you plant our birthday gifts? 
 Oh yeah. 
 Haha! 
 Oh, hey, Carl. 
 I heard you talked to Wynonna at Shorty's. 
 Brought up the Earp Curse. 
 I didn't mean nothing. 
 We can't have you running off your mouth before we get what we need. Can we, pal? 
 C'mon, Malcolm. 
 Hehe! 
 If you can't hold your tongue... 
 (Carl moaning) 
 Oh... 
 (older men laughing) 
 I will. 
 Now we stick to the plan, then we kill the girls. 
 Got it? Got it? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What are you doing in town? 
 I mean, besides my boyfriend? 
 I wasn't gonna "do" anyone, least of all that man-child. 
 I'm trying to find out what happened to Curtis. 
 Oh, and you can do better. 
 Small town, limited dating options. 
 Yeah. I remember. 
 Hey! God! 
 Ow! 
 What? 
 It's been three years. 
 God! Come here! 
 You couldn't tell me you were coming? 
 I wasn't. 
 Then, Uncle Curtis sent me an email. 
 What? What did it say? 
 "They've caught up with me." 
 I knew it wasn't a stroke. 
 It's starting again, isn't it? 
 We need that gun. 
 OK, I'm not doing this. 
 Wyatt Earp's gun. 
 Same one disappeared the night... 
 Told you, never talk about it! 
 And I don't! 
 Good! 
 Best advice you ever gave me. 
 Well... only advice, really. 
 Hey, I was a kid! 
 OK? I couldn't... 
 I couldn't look after myself, let alone... 
 What, your bratty little sister? 
 You know, it's about the only thing I've ever done right. 
 Leaving me behind? 
 Yeah, it gave you a chance. 
 Right... 
 Yeah, well, I'm not 6 anymore, OK? 
 Look, I could help. We could fight this thing, this curse together!- Waverly, there is no curse on... 
 Wynonna Earp? 
 If my parole officer's asking, then no. 
 Is there somewhere that we can go talk? 
 We got your call. And I think that this... belongs to you. 
 So, you wanna tell me exactly what happened on that bus? 
 Am I being charged with something? 
 'Cause, trust me, having to ride the bus is punishment enough. 
 A girl is dead... 
 Ms. Earp. 
 I had nothing to do with that. 
 I know. 
 I spoke to the bus driver. 
 He was scared. He said he heard something that spooked him, and that you and Kiersten were the only ones that fled the bus. 
 I'm sorry, I'm, uh... 
 Drunk? 
 Lost. 
 Are you FBI? I didn't quite recognize the badge. 
 And you've seen a lot of them given your criminal record. 
 Juvenile record. 
 And that's supposed to be sealed when an offender turns 18, and I'm 26... 
 27. 
 Happy birthday. By the way. 
 U.S. Marshals, huh? 
 You don't have jurisdiction up here. 
 Cross-border task force. 
 What's with the charcoal star? 
 Good eye. Denotes the Black Badge Division. 
 Is that some kind of covert branch? 
 We monitor specific activity that has recently flared up in this area. 
 What kind of activity? 
 Unexplainable. 
 ♪ 
 (exhaling) 
 I either need way more or way less of this stuff, I'll tell ya. 
 You know what I think, Earp? 
 I think you saw what killed Kiersten. 
 Yeah. Coyote, a big one.- Is that the story you're sticking with? 
 Where'd your sister go? 
 You leave her out of this. 
 I just want to thank her for my coffee. 
 You see, the thing is, Wynonna, our division doesn't really see a lot of survivors, so any information that you have Yeah, on how you outran... 
  I got your card. Thanks. 
 I'm sure you're getting this all the time, but is it like "Earp" as in... ? 
 Good ole Wyatt. Yep. 
 He was my great-great-grandfather. 
 The greatest gunslinger that ever lived. 
 You a good shot too? 
 I don't do guns. 
 Couldn't hit a lawman at zero paces. 
 Fortunately. 
 (door closing) 
 He seems nice. 
 As a swift kick to the box. 
 So... your 27th birthday. 
 It doesn't mean anything, Waverly. 
 Oh yeah? Then why do you look so spooked? 
 Huh? 
 Tell Gus I'm taking the truck. 
 What? 
 Where are you going?! 
 Home. 
 ♪ 
 (sigh) 
 ♪ 
 man :  They say Wyatt took down 77 outlaws with this gun. 
 And all those outlaws are resurrecting as revenants They won't rest until  they gain freedom from their earthly prison. You'll stop them, Daddy! You'll get 'em. 
 
 Willa is the eldest,  the next Earp heir destined to inherit Wyatt's abilities. Because the only thing that can put these demons down again  is you. You said they can't attack the house! They figured out how to get around the bedrock! What's happening? I got the gun! There are so many of them! There's seven of them! (creatures roaring) (girl gasping) (girl screaming) Willa! man :  NO! Shotgun won't work. He needs Wyatt's gun. I won't let them hurt anyone. Good. Because the only thing that can put these demons down again  Waverly was right. We need that gun. And I'm talking to my truck. Good news: she took the bait. She'll fetch it for us. Are you gonna ask to borrow my stuff? I noticed you already borrowed all my whiskey. I know Curtis may have stood for all that, but then, he was soft on you. He was a good man, and he deserved better than what happened to him. Something took his head, Gus. Something or someone... Oh, Wynonna... I know who killed him, and I got a plan. That's not what I meant. You got that wild look in your eyes. You're manic, paranoid. Probably off your meds, hm? What's next? More demons? Yeah, I might be certifiable. Got the paperwork to prove it. But something awful is happening in Purgatory, and it has everything to do with my last name! You're not the only Earp in town. Waverly has worked so hard just to get out from under your shadow. I know it's your birthday so... Don't worry about that. Enough for a one-way ticket back to Athens. So this is your gift for me? And for your sister. I love you, Wynonna... but you're as broken as they come. (rope-straining sounds) (shoveling sounds) (woman grunting with effort) Hello, Earp. Thirsty? No. This old well dried up a long time ago. Much like my tolerance for stalkers. No, really, are you following me? Happened to be driving by. Well, if you wanted a date... I don't. Ouch. But I might be the one person that can help you. Thanks, but I'm more of a make-everything-worse kind of gal. Gonna get worse. You think the thing that killed Kiersten is just gonna let you live? Not if I'm already gone. Earp, I know what you know. OK... Well, you don't know me, Deputy. Talk to the locals, they'll tell you. Yeah, that you're mental, a bad seed. Mm-hmm. Aw, you forgot scary good in bed. What do you want from me?! I need someone that knows the area, its people. I want you to join my squad. Work for the right side of the law for once. (laughing) You must be desperate. The situation's desperate. OK. Well, I don't do authority, alright? These days, I barely do sober. (Dolls exhales.) Then I recruit Waverly. People in town rave about her. I told you to leave her out of this! Clearly, I'm talking to the wrong sister. Yeah, you're all talking to the wrong sister! They took the good one into the hills. and slaughtered her! What was her name? Willa. I saw what being law did to my father. Whatever you've heard... getting deputized's what did him in. My bosses consider what's happening here in Purgatory urgent, and they will do whatever it takes to protect their interests. Well, good for them. So, what did you go down an old dried-up well to get, Earp? Don't follow me again. Had it up to here with surprises. Willa! You can't help! You aren't the heir! young Wynonna :  Shotgun won't work. He needs Wyatt's gun. father : No! No! No! No! No! (gunshot) Argh! Ugh! Daddy! (tires screeching) (sigh) Get ready for awesome, little Cindy. OK, maybe if I get a little closer. (gunshot) sh1t! (rope-straining sounds) (shoveling sounds) (car door closing) The black sheep returns. Jesus! Waddle along now, Nedley. Sheriff... Sheriff Nedley. You keeping your fluffy hindquarters clean or should I frisk you for old times' sakes? Wouldn't risk it. We both know you're one grope away from a heart attack. Best stick to internet p0rn and the certainty of dying alone, don't you think? Why'd you even come back, Wynonna? Haven't the people who love you suffered enough? Probably. (knocking on door) Waverly? Champ? ♪ I told you. I'm ready to help. What the sweet hell is this? That? That's just the basics. Look. Everything I could find about our family. You know, Wyatt Earp... the people he killed. Look. You're supposed to be normal, Waverly. You're supposed to be safe! Ow! You know, I scoured every library, every archive in the country, and you know what I never found? A reason why I can't break the curse. OK. How about 'cause your scrapbooking habit has taken a terrible turn?! Good one. Oh, my God! Is that Wyatt's gun? You knew where it was this whole time?! Yeah, I was 12. Panicked, I threw it away. My God, it's beautiful! Ow! It's old, it doesn't shoot straight, and it's worth enough to buy us both a chrome condo 5000 miles from here. This is our home, Wynonna. I'll protect it, even if you won't. You'll die! Not if I have this! Look, we can use it... Ow! We can use it to kill our enemies! "Enemies"? Waverly, the only person this gun ever killed was Daddy! When I shot him! You were trying to save him. Ah? It was an accident. Yeah. And it ruined my life! Not gonna let it ruin yours. Pack this sh1t up. This time, you're coming with me. Oh, yeah, run! Always do. I'm serious. I'm taking the 6 a.m. bus with or without you. Right... You know, of all the things I've ever wanted to call you... you're such a coward. Don't forget fraud. (blues song playing in the background) Mercy me. Now is that what I think it is, little lady? Let me guess. Wyatt Earp fan? Came to see the place where he drank? You know what? Let your freak flag fly free. Oh, I am free. Free as a bird, and it's sublime. OK. I ain't seen a Buntline Special in years. May I? You may not. I do reckon I know that gun. Wyatt Earp christened it "Peacemaker." You a collector? Only of poker chips and hearts. Engraving his own initials? Seems rather gauche. Doc Holliday had it done to celebrate his best friend's 50th kill. Sounds like he was soft on Wyatt. "Peacemaker." Haha! It's pretty rich. Do you have any idea how many people he killed with that thing? Are you implying Wyatt Earp was a hypocrite? I'm saying crazy runs in the family. My apologies. I did not realize I was speaking with an Earp. Bona fide. Yeah, I just figured... you were a prostitute. (small chuckle) Prostitutes get paid for it. He was good at killing, so they called him hero. What kind of person wants to be a gunslinger? Wyatt Earp wanted to be a farmer. 30 seconds in the OK Corral, and a gunslinger he was made. Sometimes, life chooses for us. Your outfit's adorable. Ma'am. (door opening and closing) Gus? Just came to say goodbye. Gus? Gus? Gus! (Gus coughing) Oh, God! They took Waverly. You'll fix this. He said, "Tomorrow... high noon." You're supposed to be following me! I called the number on your card 50 times.- I heard and I'm very sorry about Gus. She's in intensive care, Dolls. And I assure you, we are monitoring the situation. "Monitoring"? I need to find who took my sister.- You know who took your sister. Officially, coyotes; and unofficially, demons. You said it. You actually said... Yes. They had me committed. They had me sent away! We can find them, Dolls. How? They can blend in. They look just like us. You won't help my sister?

You know, I remember the exact moment in 1866 when Wyatt Earp had me hung for murdering my business partner. Too bad the hangman didn't set the noose very snug. It took 14 long minutes for me to die. Yeah, and now you're back. Yes! And not alone! Boys! I know you two. You're... you're local. Some of us are. You see, when the Earp heir turns 27, those of us killed by the last one, well, we resurrect. A little more demonic than the time before, but, one way or the other, we all end up in Purgatory. Why'd you kill, Curtis? To lure you back. Get you to fetch what we needed. Peacemaker. Hahaha! Please, get us the gun. Don't do it, they'll kill you! They'll try. Hey! OK. OK. Here goes. Look.
