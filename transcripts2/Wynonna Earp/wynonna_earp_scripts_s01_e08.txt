 Previously on Wynonna Earp... 
 Bobo sent me. Name's Bethany. 
 (growling) 
 We're gonna track down the last of the Seven if it kills me. A spade. 
 I'm Dr. Reggie. 
 She died because humans can't survive when their organs are removed. 
 So what? 
 In the shape of a spade, like on a deck of cards. 
 I'm shutting your division down. 
 I have something else. 
 Never before documented. 
 (gunshot) 
 Any idea why your homestead was targeted? 
 We should at least get some breakfast. Then we'll talk. 
 Wynonna! 
 (old-timey music) 
 Devil's hell. 
 (rustling sound) 
 Plus an angel incarnate. 
 Waverly? 
 Doc? 
 No, no, you're OK. Hey, lay back. Lay back. 
 What happened? 
 Deep breaths, Deputy Earp. 
 You remember me? 
 Uh... Dr. Ninja. 
 Am I in the morgue? 
 Thankfully, no. 
 You're in the hospital. 
 Do you remember anything about the accident? 
 Accident? 
 I was at the homestead... 
 Zombie strippers. 
 Oh, OK. Some memory loss is totally normal after such a trauma. 
 Where's Waverly? Where's my sister? Where's Doc? 
 No, no, no. We have to limit your visitors right now, until... 
 Wynonna, I need you to listen to me. 
 Why can't I move my legs? 
 There's no easy way to say this. You suffered severe damage to your spinal cord, causing paralysis from the waist down. 
 (panting frantically) 
 ♪ 'Cause I gave you all I've got to give ♪ 
♪ And no, that ain't no way to live ♪ 
♪ I told that devil ♪ 
♪ To take you back ♪ 
♪ I told that devil ♪ 
♪ To take you back ♪ 
 Dolls! Dolls! 
 Whoa! 
 Hold on, son, now there's no need for hollering. 
 Wynonna and Officer Haught, they've been taken. 
 What do you mean, taken? 
 Abducted, absconded, whatever the hell you want to call it, they're gone! 
 What do you mean, gone? 
 He's got them, Dolls. The Fiend himself. 
 You don't understand. I love my legs. 
 They're what I walk on. What are you giving me? 
 I feel so... 
 You feel hungover? 
 You're very lucky, Ms. Earp. Lucky you didn't kill anyone. 
 I wasn't drunk... anymore. 
 Ask... Nicole. 
 Nicole was driving. Where's Nicole? 
 Shh, I have to listen, OK? 
 (shivering) 
 So you're like, a full-on doctor? 
 Morgue duty is just part of our rotation. 
 I thought I might go to med school. 
 My solid D-minus thought otherwise. 
 Where'd you go? 
 Queens Undergraduate, Princeton Medical School. 
 And you chose to practice here? In Purgatory? 
 Lucky for me. 
 Indeed. I am actually pioneering a radical new procedure at this hospital. 
 To increase certain brain functions, and I guess you could say... shut down others. Certain areas of emotion cause a patient to be irrational. 
 They can be removed. 
 One question. 
 Do you only use the cane as a weapon, or are you hiding a limp under all that bullshit? 
 Excuse me? 
 Princeton doesn't have a medical school, dickwad. 
 You're not a doctor, you're a killer. A revenant. 
 People think that all it takes to become a doctor is smarts. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 A real doctor pushes boundaries. 
 Does things that others find distasteful for the sake of progress. Take yourself, Wynonna. 
 You've been a very, very bad girl. 
 But it's not your fault, is it? 
 There's something very wrong, deep inside of you. 
 And the doctor will search until he finds it, and cut it right out. 
 Off to prep an O.R. 
 Back in a jiff! 
 (whistling) 
 (gasping) 
 woman : Hello? 
 Bethany? 
 I'll call the Feds and I'm gonna make a discrete request for additional resources. 
 We need boots on the ground. 
 No. 
 No, we need choppers in the air and jets and drones and cruise missiles pointed right at Bobo's head! 
 Wasn't Bobo that took 'em. 
 Wasn't the Stone Witch neither. 
 And your fancy weapons won't do anything against Jack and his knives. 
 What kind of man... 
 To call him a man would be to speak generously. 
 In Dodge City there was a schoolteacher name of Sally. She laughed like a mule, but her eyes did shine. 
 I was sweet on her, but she went missing. Wyatt and me, we tracked her to a limestone cave in the hills. That's where we found her, with three other soiled doves that had been thought to have run off. 
 He had taken their insides out. 
 Spread them around their own bodies like a Thanksgiving feast. 
 Oh my god. 
 Papers called him 'the Jack of Knives' on account of the fact that's what he called himself in the letters he sent, taunting them. 
 Adept at all manner of blade. 
 Great. 
 Wyatt and me, we made it our mission to hunt him down. We tracked him through the Cumberland pass, nearly freezing to death, and then I got sick. 
 Real sick. 
 Wyatt never spoke of Jack again, but I know he was the one that haunted him the most. 
 Well, Wyatt must've got him eventually, otherwise the creep wouldn't be a revenant. He was a serial killer when he was human. Who knows what he's capable of now? 
 Or what he's gonna do to Wynonna. 
 Or Officer Haught. 
 The spade. 
 The spade... once symbolized a sword or unsheathed blade... 
 Or knife. 
 He's the last of the Seven. 
 Come on. 
 Whoa, whoa, Waverly. Can't go anywhere with that broken wing of yours. 
 Besides, I need you to stay here and dig deep, find more on this Jack, alright? 
 Right. Bring them home safe, OK? 
 Of course. Alright, Holliday, you said you tracked this guy before, right? 
 You think you can do it again? 
 You want my help? I figured... 
 That I'd keep you at arms' length? 
 Yeah, well, not this time, cowboy. 
 Come on. Saddle up. 
 We've found her. Officer Haught. 
 Status? 
 She's alive. Barely. 
 Motorist spotted her on the side of the highway. 
 EMS had to resuscitate on site. 
 Damn him. 
 I'm gonna need access. 
 You'll have it. Two conditions. 
 Alright, name them. 
 Doctor says she needs a break, you hightail it. 
 And when you find the b*st*rd who did this, you make sure no one else does. 
 And you. 
 Move your damn horse. 
 How long have you been here? 
 Couple days. 
 Maybe a week? 
 You had any visitors? 
 Seen any nurses, orderlies? 
 Just Dr. Reggie. 
 He's gonna fix us. 
 OK, Bethany, we're in serious sh1t here. 
 It's OK to feel nervous before a surgery. 
 This isn't a real hospital. 
 Reggie's not a real doctor. 
 He cares about me. 
 You know how long it's been since I could actually say that about a man? 
 Park your daddy issues, 'cause it's time to haul ass outta here. 
 If he's not a doctor, he's... 
 A serial killer. 
 (whimpering) 
 The good news is that you're not sick. 
 The better news... Bethany. 
 Better news is that we're leaving. 
 OK? I'll need you to get me a wheelchair, though. 
 (whistling) 
 sh1t. 
 He's coming back. 
 OK... 
 What do I do? 
 Run. Get help. 
 Go! 
 Bethany, no! Bethany! 
 I'm not like you, Wynonna. 
 I'm not brave. 
 No... 
 (whistling) 
 Time for the doctor to go to work. (clicking tongue) 
 (whistling)

 (heartbeat) 
 (machine beeping) 
 She won't stabilize. I can't lose another one! 
 Come on, come on! 
 (screaming) 
 (flatline sound) 
 (enraged screaming) 
 It's OK. It's OK. 
 I can fix the next one. 
 I just know I can fix Wynonna. 
 I know Deputy Earp is still out there, and we'll continue the search, but we agreed my Officer... 
 Is our only witness. 
 I need to question her before her memory becomes more clouded than it is. 
 I'd feel more comfortable with a greenlight from her doctor. 
 Sheriff. 
 I'm good. 
 OK? I want to help. 
 Well, I'll swing by and make sure that cat of yours is fed. 
 She doesn't really like men. 
 Well, who does? 
 OK. So what was the last thing you saw? 
 Waverly Earp, smiling at me from her front porch. 
 And, uh, a man stepping out on the highway. 
 Flagging us down. 
 Description? 
 No. Just a blank space after that. 
 Until the woods. 
 What happened? 
 Somebody was carrying me. 
 I was blindfolded, I think. 
 Or just really drugged. 
 Next thing I know I'm freezing cold, covered in dirt in a ditch the side of the road. 
 What about Wynonna? 
 Do you remember anything about Wynonna? 
 No. 
 I couldn't see anything. 
 Sight ain't your only sense, Ms. Haught. 
 What did he smell like? 
 Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in, let the memories come. 
 Sour. 
 Musty. 
 Like death? 
 No. 
 Spoiled fruit. And gasoline. 
 He kicked me. 
 What? 
 I couldn't figure out why my chest was hurting. He threw me down and he said "You're the wrong kind." 
 You're the wrong kind. You're the wrong kind. 
 You're the wrong kind. Uh... 
 Serial killers, they, um, often have a type of victim that they prefer. 
 And Wynonna? 
 Must be exactly what Jack's looking for. 
 Waverly, I'm so sorry. 
 No, it's fine. I'm just glad you're OK. 
 (Dr. Reggie screaming) 
 Come on, toes... move. 
 (sobbing) 
 Now, now. You know she's tougher than a boiled owl. 
 He's got, like, a shitload of knives. 
 And she's got us. 
 Ahem! 
 Initial tests came back from Nicole's uniform. 
 Traces of ethyl alcohol. 
 Yeah, the... gasoline smell she remembered. 
 Common by-product of chemical manufacture. Like designer drugs. 
 Certain types of explosives. 
 Sour fruit. 
 Excuse me? 
 Nicole also said she smelled sour fruit. As in fermented fruit. 
 Liquor. 
 Ethyl isn't in liquor. 
 Back in my day it was. Bootleggers used it to make moonshine. 
 Doc, you're a genius! 
 Let's not get carried away. 
 OK, I think I know where he has her. 
 Right. Late 1930s, Purgatory gets a new sewage system. Construction crew hits what they think is a sinkhole. 
 They actually found a series of tunnels used during prohibition to smuggle liquor across the border. 
 Prohibition? 
 From 1919 to 1933 the United States banned the sale, the making and consumption of alcohol. 
 Lord, I'm almost glad I was in the well for that. 
 So Jack went from using caves to using those tunnels. 
 Does this map give their location? 
 No, unfortunately. 
 The town just sealed them up. But I think I have an idea who might know where they are. 
 OK, 1884, Wyatt killed a corrupt saloon owner named James Byers. 
 James Byers. 
 Same name appears again in 1925 in connection with a rumored liquor run. 
 It could be two guys or... 
 Or a revenant. 
 Aw, hell. 
 (chuckling) 
 Let me guess. You knew him? 
 I know him. 
 Runs an operation in town. 
 What kind of operation are we talking about? 
 The best kind, highly illegal. 
 (crowd cheering) 
 (barking) 
 There are two rules to this, Mr. Dolls. 
 Let me guess. 
 First rule of fight club, never talk about fight club, right? 
 Nobody talks about it, how're fellas gonna know where it is? No, the first rule is, You never, ever bring the law. 
 And what's the second rule? 
 Wait here. Boss is comin'. 
 Oh... 
 (crowd and flinching) 
 (cracking) 
 Ooh! 
 What d'you think, human or revenant? Kinda hard to tell. 
 Well, Whiskey Jim likes to mix it up. 'Course, the humans have no idea they're stepping into the ring with a demon. 
 Adds a bit of whimsy to your typical pugilistic festivities, no? 
 Look who the cat dragged in. 
 Whiskey Jim. 
 Doc Holliday. 
 You being here means one of two things. 
 Either you got my 10K, or you got a death wish. 
 Of course, you owe him money. (chuckling) 
 Did I forget to mention that? 
 Listen, this idiot doesn't have what he owes you, but my division does. 
 All in exchange for some information. Is there a place we can talk, Whiskey Jimmy? 
 Bloody Black Badge? 
 Rule number one, moron. 
 (crowd cheering) 
 
 
 
 Yo. What up, Doctor Murder? 
 How are you feeling? 
 Floaty. These drugs are hella dope. And coming from me, that's saying something. 
 I need to ask you some questions about your personal history. 
 Cut the bullshit. 
 I know who you are. 
 The last of the Seven. Which means I'm sure as sh1t not telling you anything. 
 You're awfully mouthy for a girl who just found out she's paralyzed. 
 Bethany hasn't come back. 
 I'm just scared, OK? 
 That's why it's important to have a healthy and open patient-doctor dialogue. 
 So tell me, Wynonna... 
 Can you feel this? 
 (cracking) 
 Nope. 
 You could be giving me a pedicure. 
 Good. Still, we should up your meds. 
 The doctor just wants to understand you. Don't you want to be understood? 
 I want to be on a beach in Hawaii with two very impressionable cabana boys. 
 Always with the jokes. Tell me, Wynonna... 
 What happened after you killed your own father? 
 I was committed. Put under the care of a 'specialist'. 
 Every time I told the truth, I got a nice jolt of electric juice. 
 Was the shock therapy effective? 
 Yeah. 
 Made me good at poker and now I don't have to shave my left leg. 
 You use humor as a form of self-defence. 
 I prefer my Buntline special. What'd you do with Peacemaker? 
 Get a good grip on it? 
 Stings a little, don't it, Revenant? 
 Hey, that's mine. 
 What is it doing over here? 
 You must've snagged it on something when you wheeled me in. Give it back. 
 Answer my questions without any more guff. 
 And you won't cut me open? 
 Wynonna, we have to do the surgery. 
 For your own good. 
 To fix me, yeah. Did you fix Bethany? 
 The doctor has ensured that she's in no more pain. 
 What is with psychos and talking in the third person? 
 I'm not psycho! 
 Fine, you're not psycho. You're not psycho. 
 You're delightful. Top notch. 
 I'll answer whatever, OK? 
 Just put my necklace back on me, please. 
 On second thought, you're not really in a position to do any bargaining, are you? 
 OK, look, we just need the entrance to your old bootlegging tunnels, that's it. 
 Let's say I was willing to help you. And I ain't. 
 Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone. 
 They were boarded up a long time ago. 
 Nobody knows how to find them. 
 Well, somebody does. 
 That 'someone' has a very sharp blade and Bobo's backin'. 
 Ain't got nothin' to do with me. 
 Look, just tell us where they are and we'll be on our way, alright, Whiskey? 
 This is my place. 
 (deep voice): I do the asking. 
 And you owe me plenty. 
 Look, we are all businessmen here. 
 Can't we come to some sort of arrangement? 
 Hmm... 
 You do look like you can handle yourself. 
 Yeah, I do alright. 
 (laughing) 
 Alright. You want my help? 
 You two need to earn it. Here, now. 
 In the ring. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. You really want me to fight him? 
 What, you yella? 
 No, I'm being realistic, and let's be real, you won't get your money's worth. 
 Oh, I'll take that bet. 
 Shut up. 
 Whatever. 
 Just make sure there's blood. 
 Lots of it. One of you leaves on a stretcher, or neither of you leaves at all. 
 You give me that? 
 I'll tell you where my tunnels are. 
 Rule number two, don't come if you ain't willing to fight. 
 Wynonna! 
 Wynonna! 
 This fella's been looking for a chance to give you this. 
 Boss man sent him. 
 I guess Bobo wants you alive for something. 
 You best read it quick. 
 Dolls, you slimy motha... 
 (bell dinging) 
 Place your bets, gents! 
 Alright, let's go! 
 Come on! 
 That's enough. It's showtime. 
 Alright. 
 OK, look, we're running out of time. 
 Let's just give this guy what he wants. 
 We should make it look real. 
 Who says it ain't? 
 Oof! 
 Heh, heh! 
 Alright, old-timer. Playtime's over. 
 (clamoring) 
 (cheering) 
 (laughing) 
 I see you've found my missing scalpel. 
 Know how to make someone show you where something precious is hidden? 
 Set fire to their house. 
 It's the first thing they go for. 
 Wynonna, don't be rash. 
 You'll never find Officer Haught without me. 
 New deal, Reggimite. 
 Tell me where she is, and I'll make your trip back to hell an express. 
 Screw around, and I will have some fun before I blow your Revenant brains out. 
 Hell? 
 You killed Nicole, didn't you, you sonuvabitch? 
 No. 
 Red blood? You're human. 
 I'm sorry, Doctor. 
 No need to say sorry, Reginald. 
 You served your purpose. 
 And now, you are released. 
 Who are you? 
 I've had a lot of names. 
 But you can call me Jack. 
 (clamoring) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (cheering) 
 What happened to your shoulder, huh? 
 I'm surprised you don't know. It wasn't in your report? 
 Yeah! 
 (crowd cheering) 
 How?! 
 Who told you? 
 Who gave it to you? 
 (grunting) 
 You wanna poke and prod me for science? 
 You wanna put me back in a cage? 
 You are a dirty, two-faced son of a bitch liar. 
 crowd : Ohh! 
 What're you waiting for!? Get up! One of you two needs to eat this mat, or this deal's off! 
 Wynonna will never forgive you if you hand me over to the authorities. 
 You didn't help her when it mattered. 
 She's with Jack because of you. 
 No wonder why Wyatt left you to die. 
 (crowd cheering) 
 Winner! 
 Ohh! You sir did give me one hell of a show. You killed him! 
 We'll deal with his corpse. 
 Much obliged. 
 Now, I expect Black Badge will be snooping around, asking about their missing agent. 
 I'd make myself scarce, ASAP. 
 The entrance to the tunnels. 
 Now, I promised him that information. 
 Him's dead... 
 Now, goddammit! 
 (laughing) 
 Well, you did give me one helluva good show! 
 That file Dolls had was classified. 
 How'd Bobo get it? 
 We revenants are trapped inside the Ghost River Triangle. 
 But Bobo, his reach extends far beyond that. 
 He's got friends in high places, that one. 
 Oh, oh, oh! 
 I, uh, got these off your dead friend. 
 Don't think he'll be needing them anymore. 
 (whistling) 
 You needed a human to handle Peacemaker for you. 
 (whistling) 
 Somebody lost their head. 
 (horn honking) 
 Jesus H. Christ! 
 Nope. 
 You weren't leaving without me, were ya? 
 Never touch my stuff. 
 (whistling) 
 Your nose is bleeding. 
 Got a tampon? 
 Or, you know, an inkling to get me to a real hospital? 
 Wyatt's nose bled like that when I first met him. 
 I've been studying you for a long while. 
 We are so alike. 
 Insane? 
 No. 
 You work with a team, not because you want to, but because you have to. 
 Like me. And you prefer to hunt alone. 
 Like me. 
 This is a trick that Reginald taught me. 
 Surgeons today like to draw a map on their patients for where they're going to cut. 
 Any chance this surgery is elective? 
 It's mandatory, I'm afraid. 
 Thought doctors had to take an oath to do no harm. 
 I've never really been a doctor. 
 But I did study surgery. 
 And by study, I mean, I love to cut open bodies. 
 I like to see what makes people... people. 
 See, even when I was human, I wasn't. 
 Not way down deep. 
 I owe Reggie an apology. You're the sickest puppy in the litter. 
 Flattery's not gonna save you. 
 What is your damage? 
 Mommy didn't love you enough? 
 (giggling) 
 Or is this because every woman you ever met rejected you? 
 Maybe. 
 Your dime-store psychology is adorable, Wynonna. 
 I love women. 
 Can't you tell? 
 Feast for the eyes. And every man has a favorite body part upon which to gaze. 
 (whispering): I love to look at your organs. 
 And I'm gonna keep you alive just long enough that you can look at them too. 
 You dead, and now you are nuts. 
 Oh, how the tables and have turned. 
 Army Night Rangers. Elite paramilitary unit. 
 They train us in how to lower our pulse, control our breathing. 
 Make the enemy think you're dead. 
 Oh, aren't you the master of deception. 
 Here we go. 
 If your bosses have no compunction about turning a person into a pin cushion, how are they better than the demons? 
 Your body is a treasure trove for science. 
 Think about what the military could do with soldiers who didn't get sick, didn't age? 
 It was a decision made for the good of the many. 
 I get to choose who I share my treasure trove with, not the goddamn government. 
 If Wynonna wasn't in danger, I would shoot you right now. 
 Yeah. If Wynonna wasn't in danger, you would be in the back of a van. 
 Hey, hey, hey! Watch it! 
 Ooh! Easy now. 
 I'm just gettin' ready. But once Wynonna is safe... 
 Yeah. Once Wynonna's safe. 
 Now. 
 How the hell do we get in there? 
 Reginald always used antiseptic because he thought that there was a chance that the patients would survive the procedure, but... let's not kid ourselves. 
 You're not gonna survive this. 
 Now... only the best for the heir. 
 Wait! 
 Before I die, just tell me. 
 Tell you what? 
 Why. 
 Why send the posse of seven? 
 If Bobo really wanted my daddy dead, he could've done it himself. 
 Don't forget, it wasn't the posse that killed dear old Ward. 
 It was a scared and confused little girl. 
 It was an accident. 
 I know, I was there. 
 I know you're not gonna believe this, but I really liked your father. 
 He wasn't like the other Earp heirs. 
 He wasn't ambitious like Edwin, or courageous like Josiah, but he had something that they didn't have. 
 Wits. 
 When Ward started his little ride, he realized that in order to survive, he was gonna have to make certain alliances. 
 With who? Black Badge? 
 Don't be daft. 
 He made a pact with the big man himself. 
 Bobo Del Rey. 
 No. My daddy would never make a deal with a demon. Never. 
 They were very close friends. 
 (scoffing) Liar. 
 I'm sorry, Wynonna, that I break your heart. 
 Now I'm going to cut it out. 
 No! No! 
 (gunshot) 
 Took you long enough. 
 You're welcome. 
 Doc Holliday. 
 I always hoped that I'd have this pleasure. 
 Where did you get the Stone Witch's trinket? 
 Normally I just carve up women, but, Doctor, in your case I'm gonna make an exception. 
 Looks like it's just me and you, Jackie Boy. 
 Go! Go get it. 
 Peacemaker? 
 Yeah. 
 It's across the hall. Whisky barrels. 
 Quick! OK. 
 Did I get him? 
 Not your job. 
 Oh! 
 It just got a little wet. 
 Mmm. Oak-aged. 
 Thank you. Don't kill each other. 
 Alright... 
 So. 
 Yep. 
 Good talk. 
 Oh, we are done talkin'. 
 I think this would be a good juncture to remind you that I am the fastest gunslinger that ever walked the earth. 
 Hm. Debatable. What about Billy the Kid? 
 Ooh, I should shoot you right now, just for being such an obstreperous jackass. 
 So go ahead. Take me out. 
 Just know they've got satellites. Predator drones. 
 You look like you just came out of the Grand Ole Opry, so they will find you, Doc. 
 And you, sir, are an asshole. 
 But you are not a villain. 
 So why, Dolls? 
 It was you. Or her. 
 I see. 
 D'you know what Wyatt used to say? He used to say, 'Doc, well, if you stand for nothing, you are sure to fall.' 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 You do what you do best, Deputy Marshal Dolls, you fight. 
 OK. 
 Well, that was easy. 
 (grunting and wheezing) 
 Just think about it. Think about it. 
 Think about it. 
 I'm the last of the Seven. 
 What happens when you kill me? 
 Order too much Thai and open a bottle of wine? 
 Once I'm gone, you'll have to deal with the puppet master. 
 And Bobo Del Rey makes the rest of us look like choir boys. 
 Yeah. 
 But he'll still make the same pathetic hissing sound when I shoot him between the eyes. 
 You're talking tough, but you're just like me. You're broken. 
 I can hear the fear in your voice. 
 (gun cocking) 
 (Jack laughing) 
 Oh, I wish I could stay! 
 Watch what's coming next. 
 A reunion... an escape. 
 So much blood. 
 You attacked my home and killed my sister. 
 Now make your peace. 
 What's the hurry, little girl? 
 Enjoy the moment. 
 Savor the kill. 
 Who's this, you do impressions now? Who is that, Judi Dench? 
 You've solved a great mystery. 
 Succeeded where Scotland Yard failed, and all by your lonesome. 
 I ain't interested. 
 And I'm not lonesome. 
 I just prefer to hunt alone. 
 (screaming) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 You have to let go sometime, Waves. 
 Maybe tomorrow. 
 Well, just like that, the Seven are gone. 
 Just like that, huh? 
 So what now? 
 Wynonna? 
 You stand by this report? 
 That your Deputy possibly dispatched the most notorious serial killer in history? 
 I said possibly. There's no way to prove it without a body. 
 How convenient. Where's my delivery? 
 Oh yeah. I will be formally withdrawing the report I filed on the alleged target. Henry is nothing but a con artist. A good one, but... the real Doc Holliday is dead. 
 You continue to disappoint me. 
 As long as I keep surprising you.
