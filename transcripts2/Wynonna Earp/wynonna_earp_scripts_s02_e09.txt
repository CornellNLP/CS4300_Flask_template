 Previously on Wynonna Earp. 
   You fell asleep entwined. 
   It's a new thing. 
  It's casual. 
   My DNA test. 
   You can't unsee the result. 
   I'm not a child, Nicole. 
   I should've known you two had something to do with the curse. 
   - What do these Widows want? 
  - Time. 
   That little Tucker is dead. 
   Hands on your head! 
  Now! 
   - Tucker! 
  - We need to work fast  - until we find the last seal. 
  - The third seal? 
  It's Doc's ring. 
   A wedding ring, on the finger of the best gunslinger alive. 
   If those bitches in black break it, Clootie the demon will rise.

  Ended up with tennis elbow.

   I don't hate Nicole! 
  We just had a fight.

  This happens, you're a goner. 
  Boom! 
   Baby bump apology. 
  (chuckling) 
   Hey. 
   You need to learn this, OK? 
   'Cause the Widows are not playing to lose. 
   Well, hell hath no fury like two bitches whose demon husband  got shot by your... 
   ancestor. 
  Sounded a lot snappier in my head. 
   You know, I still can't get over Constance being their  sister-wife. 
  Her outfits were so fiercely non-polygamous. 
   And turns out she was the nice one. 
   Demon Clootie rises, the other two  are going to wreak havoc. 
  So much revenge. 
   We have to find the third seal. 
   Uh... 
  yeah, I'm going to put a pin in that. 
   What?! 
  We don't have time to put a pin in anything. 
   - Just the tip. 
  - Hey, I think  it's best that we stick... 
  I mean, focus on the Widows. 
   - Do that. 
  I need a favor. 
  - Yeah. 
  Anything. 
   - What's up? 
  - Uh... 
  the night off. 
   Why? 
  Is it because of the whole... 
   Dying and coming back to life? 
  No, I'm just glad I didn't  - reincarnate as a dung beetle. 
  - Yeah. 
  Me too. 
   Yeah. 
  And I'm gonna need the house too. 
   More nesting? 
   I just think we've reached maximum capacity  in the decorative pillow department. 
   OK, fine. 
  Listen. 
  Everyone will have the evening off. 
   Boom, shakalaka!

   Kind of weird. 
   A spa, OK? 
  Massages, facials, those type of things. 
   Also, 30 percent off  all services on Wednesdays. 
   You two have done a lot for me. 
   So... 
  here. 
   It's stupid. 
   Look, I'm not really good at these things. 
   So can you please take the God damn gift card,  grab Doc Holliday and just...

  You're welcome. 
   Can you really see Doc at a spa? 
   Yeah. 
  With you I can. 
   Also some pretty sweet blackmail photos. 
   Oh... 
  yeah.

  But the boss man loves all sports  and I want him to love me.

  - Subtle. 
   Ugh! 
  You know, I'm too hangry to have this conversation. 
   - Who emptied out the kitchen? 
  - Who do you think? 
   She even brought her own grocery bags.

  Big dinner with Doc tonight.

  She's usually off by now.

  - Hm! 
  Speak of the devil. 
   - Hey! 
  Come on in. 
  - Hey. 
   Sorry to interrupt... 
  whatever this is. 
   A body's been found. 
   Oh! 
  You sure it wasn't someone else's body that you  stole and hid because you thought you had the right  to make that utterly-not-your decision? 
   Why would Nicole steal a body? 
   Shut up, Jeremy. 
   - Yup, got it. 
  - You think this is a BBD case? 
   I think it's an everyone case.

  Poor thing. 
   Hey, you recognize this? 
   And that. 
  He's allergic to penicillin? 
   Yeah, I'm 99 percent sure that's not what killed him. 
   There's usually a name... 
   - Oh. 
  - What? 
   - I think you mean, "Who?" - It's Tucker. 
   Tucker Gardner. 
   Oh no, no! 
  No can touch,  'cause that is not appropriate or allowed. 
   - His body is evidence. 
  - Mhm. 
   - Yeah. 
  - Was he alive when he... 
   Yeah. 
   It's OK. 
  It's better that I know the truth. 
   He did this to himself. 
   Why would you think that? 
   Tucker had many dark... 
  proclivities. 
   Fire was just one of them. 
   I remember poor Blaze... 
  our cat. 
   Unfortunate name. 
   Tucker always had it out for the poor thing. 
   Father buried the body  and mother just pretended it never happened. 
   Mercedes always used to say,  "One day that boy is gonna light himself on fire."  - Wow. 
  - Regardless, can you think  of anyone who would have wanted to hurt him? 
   Can you think of anyone who wouldn't? 
   When can we take him home? 
   Oh, uh... 
  a few days. 
  The autopsy procedure  on a burn victims is much more extensive. 
   - Death by fire is like the... 
  - (thudding) 
   Can I at least take his personal effects? 
   Mercedes will want to plan a service. 
   Oh, I'm sorry, but it's...

  - Yep, you got it. 
   - Of course. 
  - But, um... 
   Look, Ms. 
  Gardner... 
   I know this is a very difficult time for you right now, but  when you're ready, of course... 
   Tucker was associating himself with a couple of women  - that we've been looking for... 
  - (sighing) 
   - Just get water. 
  Water. 
  Water. 
  Yep. 
  - Yes. 
  OK. 
   Hey. 
   Am I the biggest cliché ever? 
   No. 
   I know what you're going through. 
   Of course you do. 
   Your father, your sister... 
   How are you not bitter? 
   Mm... 
  I have my moments. 
   You're so lovely. 
   Thank you. 
   I'm sorry  that Tucker was so awful to both of you. 
   - It's fine. 
  - No, it's not. 
   Well, you of all people should understand why Tucker was drawn  to Waverly. 
  Love takes on many forms. 
  What's deviant to some  is normal to others. 
   What are you trying to say? 
   I know that Tucker was... 
  odd. 
   But in his own way, he loved Waverly. 
   - That's no excuse. 
  - Nicole, stop. 
   You're right. 
   - I should go. 
  - If you need anything,  at all, let me know. 
  OK? 
   You're an exceptional girl. 
   I cannot believe she'd try to rationalize  - her brother's behavior. 
  - He's lying on a table,  burnt beyond recognition. 
   Sometimes lying is a kindness. 
   Yeah, I tried that. 
   With you. 
  And look at us now. 
   Waverly, that girl  Tucker kidnapped and brought to your room? 
   He wanted it to be you.

   You gonna tell me about that... 
  that cut? 
   Oh, I paid a visit to our witchy friend at the salt flats. 
   Because you're a masochist? 
   Just not myself. 
   Turned out to be a quick reunion seeing  as Constance has been decapitated. 
   You killed her?! 
   If I had, I'd be dead. 
  Mutually assured destruction, remember? 
   Yeah, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Well, somebody destructed her.

  - Yes. 
   Two of them. 
   And I thought that is why you brought me here,  to talk about the plan for the baby? 
   No. 
  No. 
  But soon. 
   Those goddamned Widows nearly killed you just a day ago. 
   There is no more "soon," there is only now. 
   I know how you got the cut. 
   Something demonic attacked you. 
   - There will be more.

   More than classic, less than epic. 
   Guess you two are still in your  post-fight lull? 
  That's the worst. 
   No. 
  The worst is going for round two,  and then three, and I can't even go home  because Wynonna and Doc are...

   Well, luckily I'd already  lost my appetite. 
  Now, what is this third seal  I supposedly have on my person? 
   It's your ring. 
   And I need it.

   Anything at all. 
   I don't want to borrow it.

  Yes.

   I shoved a couple in my bag already. 
   (laughing) 
   Oh my God! 
   I saw it with my own eyes,  in the vision quest. 
   Constance created her seal, the third seal... 
   That ring is it. 
   This ring is the key to my immortality. 
   Agelessness. 
   - Beg pardon? 
  - You're not immortal, right? 
   You just don't get old. 
   Isn't that getting boring? 
   You dare be so glib with my life? 
   No. 
  I dare to try  to make mine and my family's safer. 
   I saw the Widows destroy the second seal. 
   It requires a devilry I'm not certain even you can muster. 
   Well, you've seen me before coffee, right? 
   And if you break it, and if Clootie rises,  how do you propose to kill the mighty demon  Wyatt himself could not put in the grave  - for good? 
  - We'll figure it out,  and then we'll end the curse. 
   Doc, we'll end it! 
   Together. 
   Not like this. 
  The risk is too great. 
   I may have betrayed Wyatt,  but I vowed to spend the rest of my life protecting the Earps. 
   Well, how convenient. 
  When did you supposedly make this sacred vow? 
   The moment I laid eyes on you. 
   - Oh. 
  - I cannot protect  - you if I am dead. 
  - If I believed this would  - kill you, I wouldn't ask.

   You don't want to be one of us.

  Walk all the way back to Purgatory? 
   Yes!

   Yeah. 
  Totally. 
  Just, uh...

   Well, Rosita isn't what you think she is, bud. 
  Sorry.

   Hey! 
  Wynonna, your condition. 
   That's not what this is about. 
   Give me the ring. 
   It's mine. 
  I was destined to have it. 
   You made a bad deal and it went even badder. 
   You think getting tossed down that well, that dark,  enclosed space, was arbitrary? 
   No! 
  Constance chose that particular torture  - especially for me. 
  - How you figure that? 
   When I was 14 years old,  my mama lay sick with tuberculosis. 
   It was contagious,  so they kept me from her side. 
   I crawled into a space beneath the house,  under her room. 
   And do you know what I did,  - night after night? 
  - No. 
   I listened to her cry. 
   And beg. 
  And pray. 
   She died anyway. 
   And I never again  could stand tight quarters. 
   What was her name? 
   Alice.

   Just don't shoot any of my decorative pillows. 
   I'll never find the right colour combination again. 
   You repeat this convo, you die. 
   (dramatic music) 
   (Waverly): You do not! 
   - Three?! 
  Three PhDs? 
  - Well, technically two. 
   Engineering and biochemistry. 
   The... 
  the astrology was just an online certification. 
   I was dating a Scorpio. 
  I panicked. 
   So you come from  a rocket scientist, super model family? 
   No. 
   Well, they must be pretty proud. 
   They aren't around anymore. 
   It's OK. 
  It was a long time ago. 
   (phone beeping) 
   I... 
  ugh. 
  Can you answer her already? 
   No! 
  No. 
   That's exactly what Nicole wants me to do. 
   So controlling. 
   I'm trying not to look, but... 
   - I'm seeing a lot of "sorrys." - I know. 
  It's just... 
   This wasn't a squabble  over a borrowed shirt. 
   Well, what... 
 
 
 
   - What was in those papers anyway? 
  - Stuff that made me  realize that my whole life has been a lie. 
   Yeah, which makes the people  that supposedly cared about me, liars. 
   Wow, there it is. 
   - What? 
  - Backbone. 
   Fine. 
   - Dear Control Freak. 
  - Uh... 
   I will talk to you  when I want to talk to you. 
   - Oh... 
  - Until then,  have a nice life  hurting the people that you love. 
   No! 
  I, uh... 
  don't  send... 
  like that. 
  OK. 
   - Yeah. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  What did I do? 
   A little too much backbone. 
  But it's gonna be OK. 
   Nicole was right to hide those papers. 
  I never  should have looked at them. 
  (Waverly sighing) 
   I messed up. 
  We had it so perfect. 
   Perfect is overrated. 
   If everything was perfect, then champagne wouldn't have bubbles. 
   Hm. 
   Bubbles are made up of carbon dioxide  rising from nucleation points. 
   And nucleation points are these small defects  in the glass that trap these tiny,  vibrating pockets of the carbon dioxide. 
   So, no defect, no bubbles,  no magic. 
   I'm... 
  I'm with Nicole! 
   I'm with Doc. 
   I'm gonna... 
  go get changed.

  I saw your body. 
   I'm the reason people shouldn't pick up hitch-hikers. 
   Rosita...

   What did I do? 
  I got frostbite. 
   I almost froze to death coming back here for you! 
   It's OK. 
  I'm here to save you. 
   - From her? 
  - No. 
   From those bitches who call themselves my sisters. 
   (unsettling music) 
   (Dolls): Backyard,  four occupants in sight. 
   Fingernail may not be enough for... 
   probable cause, but tonight I do not give a sh1t. 
   Wynonna knew something was off with those Gardner women. 
   - I should have listened to her. 
  - I'm sending you a mental hug,  - buddy. 
  - Not now, Jeremy. 
   Not while I'm in tactical, OK? 
   - Sorry. 
  You sounded sad. 
  - Hey! 
  Stay put and be quiet. 
   Easy for you to say! 
  The more nervous I get,  the more I talk. 
  The more you tell me not to talk,  the more nervous I get. 
  It is a vicious cycle. 
   Ack!

   Doc, shut up. 
  Do you really think that I would shoot you to get the ring? 
   Yeah, I've been reading about hormones. 
  Unstable buggers. 
   Oh ho! 
  So you think that because I'm... 
  I'm...

   Things are different. 
  You are mere weeks from giving birth. 
   No! 
  Stop! 
  Do not  ever forget  that I am the heir of this God damn curse.

  That means  that anything that has to do with the curse  is mine. 
  That ring included. 
   - You think so? 
  - I know so. 
   Then come and get it. 
   (eerie laughter) 
   (suspenseful music) 
   Being a Gardner was suffocating. 
   Mercedes and Beth were always telling me what to do. 
   Then one day, they changed. 
   Gave me freedom, supported me. 
  Do you know why? 
   They saw something unique in you. 
   Yes! 
  It felt like  I finally had the family I wanted. 
   I felt like... 
  I could be... 
   me. 
   I guess you've always known what that feels like. 
   Not so much. 
   I used to think you were too good for me. 
   Now I see how alike we are. 
   Two lost souls. 
   You said you found your family. 
   I said I felt like I found my family. 
   You have to listen. 
   We can work on that. 
   Mercedes and Beth believe that you're dead. 
   They'll... 
  they'll be so happy. 
   I want to be there when you tell them... 
   That's not gonna happen, Waverly. 
   Those things that look like Mercedes and Beth? 
   Aren't. 
  It's gonna sound crazy,  but inhuman creatures,  demons, took their place. 
   - They're possessed? 
  - No. 
   The creatures have their own bodies. 
   So your real sisters are OK? 
   Hey, it's OK! 
  Look, I'm not gonna hurt you. 
   (Tucker): I think one is still hanging on... 
   (yelping) 
   But without a face, what's a girl to do? 
   - (Tucker laughing) 
  - Oh, man... 
   You're right. 
  It's not funny. 
   If these new sisters are so wonderful,  - why would fake your death? 
  - Because it turns out  they were the fakers. 
   All their praise, approval. 
   All lies. 
   You wouldn't use me like that, would you? 
   Never. 
   I'm gonna get you out of here. 
   - (doors crashing shut) 
  - Whoa. 
  OK. 
   Hey, listen. 
   I'm gonna get you out of here, OK? 
   (whimpering) 
   I'll be back. 
   (Tucker): We don't need anyone else. 
   We'll be each other's family. 
   That's so sweet. 
   - Oh, shoot. 
  - What? 
   Well, my... 
  my old family. 
   Wynonna. 
  She'll...

   She'll never stop. 
   But if... 
  if I call her  and tell her that I'm going out of town for a while, then... 
   we won't have to be fugitives. 
   You're a clever girl. 
   One call. 
   I'll be listening. 
   - (Widow): I can smell you. 
  - More Burberry,  less burnt-in-a-church than you'd hoped? 
   Didn't know your department delivered. 
  Fantastic. 
   - I'm starving. 
  - Ooh, is that why  you killed Tucker? 
  'Cause you couldn't barbecue us,  so you got yourself a kids' meal? 
   Why does everyone assume it was me? 
   Surrender now and I might give you some leniency. 
   Like the time Black Badge kept us in a box? 
   (gasping) 
   I heard that we piped in some pretty good muzak. 
   - Don't mock me. 
  - Where's your sister? 
   Give her up, I might be able to provide  some sanctuary. 
   - Tempting... 
  but no. 
  - You said you'd do  anything, you'd give anything to ensure my happiness. 
   You are one greedy girl. 
   Oh, you! 
  Yeah, I saw who you were!
