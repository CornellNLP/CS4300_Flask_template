 Previously on Wynonna Earp... 
 Do it! 
 I remember you. 
 Do you remember what happened after you were taken? 
 No. 
 Her being here could be dangerous. 
 Are you scared of me? 
 I'll need more than this. 
 On the way. 
 [gunfire] 
 Wasn't a siege. The target was me. 
 You only have four days until the door opens, and if it does, she will lose, Doc. 
 [clinking] 
 Oh! 
 Get away from her! 
 [gunshot] 
 Wynonna, he saved me. 
 [moaning] 
 Son of a... 
 The word you're looking for is Earp. 
 Did Bobo have anything to do with the attack on the Homestead? 
 Why can't I remember anything? 
 Was it Lou that took away my memories? 
 Or was it Bobo? 
 Who abducted Willa? 
 And how does he know me? 
 I don't even know you! 
 Willa Earp! 
 Willa Earp? 
 I'll be goddamned. 
 Ah, ah! Well, it all makes sense now. 
 What does? 
 Uh-uh. 
 [screaming] 
 Goddamn! The surge. 
 The what? 
 OK. 
 Couple years before Wynonna came to town... we all felt it. 
 It was this... powerful rippling throughout the Ghost River Triangle. 
 We didn't think anything of it. 
 The Heir was dead. 
 But I'm not, am I? 
 Aw, you two got a beef, huh? 
 Bitch on bitch makes for very bankable entertainment. 
 [growling] 
 Look, Bourbon Bob, or whatever the hell your name is, you think this is a game... it's one I came back to finish. But this time, I make the rules. 
 And no one will stop me. 
 Not Bobo, not Black Badge, and certainly not a useless son of a goddamned bitch like you. 
 [whimpering] 
 Willa, no... 
 [gunshot] 
 [screaming] 
 He wasn't giving us anything. 
 He wasn't ours to kill. 
 Dolls... has nothing to do with this curse and certainly has a serious attitude problem. 
 I don't like him, Wynonna. 
 Well, who does? 
 I need to find out why Bobo showed up at the Homestead. 
 I had a clear shot at him and you... 
 I panicked. 
 Bobo knows things about me. 
 I saw it in his eyes. 
 He dies, all those answers go away. OK? 
 No. 
 Wynonna, what is happening to us? 
 What's happening is that we're down a gun. Because as far as heirs go... it looks like there are two. 
 ♪♪ 'Cause I gave you all I've got to give ♪ 
♪ And no, that ain't no way to live ♪ 
♪ I told that devil ♪ 
♪ To take you back ♪ 
♪ I told that devil To take you back ♪♪ 
 What do you see? 
 Willa, Willa, my forehead. 
 Don't tell me what to do. 
 Sorry. 
 OK, I'm calling it. 
 Hypnotizing a cult victim? 
 It could fry her brain. 
 Willa : It's OK. 
 I can do this. 
 OK. 
 We're good. 
 Breathe in, and breathe out. 
 Let yourself go into the void, nothing in particular. 
 Just being. 
 What do you see? 
 [screaming] 
 [gasping] 
 They've got me. 
 Daddy, help me! 
 [gunshot] 
 Daddy! 
 Wynonna! 
 [squeals] 
 He has his hand over my mouth. 
 Shh. 
 He's saying not to scream. 
 If you scream, I'm going back for your sisters to skin them alive. 
 [screaming] 
 Shh. 
 [sobbing] 
 [sobbing] 
 Wynonna : Malcolm. 
 I'm glad I killed him first. 
 We need to try again. 
 No. 
 I'll get Nicole to drive her home. 
 [door closing] 
 How many times do I have to tell you? That stuff is poison. 
 I've been dressing her wound for the past two days. 
 Yeah. And I've been re-dressing it. 
 Coconut oil. We used it on everything at the commune. 
 You know, you don't have to be here every time. 
 I know what I'm doing. 
 Oh yeah... 
 Uh, hey! 
 Why don't you pop out, and I'll talk to you later? 
 Sure. I'll just... "pop out." 
 [door closing] 
 I was rude again, wasn't I? 
 No. It's fine. 
 On top of everything else, I have to learn how to be around regular people again. 
 Until then... you've got me. 
 Hm. 
 OK, can we talk about the weaponed-up elephant in the room, and narrow down who tried to assassinate you? 
 Oh, that could be a long list: Bobo, Lucado... 
 You think your boss tried to snuff you out? 
 We have a pretty contentious relationship. And I gotta explore all options. 
 Doc. 
 [scoffing] 
 Come on, you joking? 
 No. 
 He... He's an option. He fled town. 
 He didn't "flee." You gave him a car. 
 There may be a lot of people that want me dead, but it ain't Doc Holliday. 
 And if it was him, he'd just deliver the dynamite himself. 
 Yeah, he is classy like that. 
 Look, if you want me to put an APB out on him... 
 No. I'm not asking for anything. I really don't give a sh1t where he went. 
 OK. Yeah. 
 Jesus, look at this stuff. 
 It's like Black Friday sale at dudeswhokill.com. 
 And, uh, yeah. I found this when I disposed of the bodies. 
 Those are elements indicative of Rangers. 
 Those are your peeps. 
 Yeah. 
 Guess nothing's sacred, huh? 
 Apparently not. 
 But the elements right here... 
 The Machetes. 
 Another elite group. Dangerous guys. Guns, drugs, delicious potato salad that'll go from lips to hips in five seconds. 
 You know what? 
 They have a chapter here in town. 
 Bet it started with ex-servicemen. 
 We make a pretty good team. 
 We should get t-shirts. 
 Don't push it. 
 [knocking] 
 You got a sec? 
 Yeah! Anything for Purgatory's finest. 
 Other than me of course. 
 [chuckling] 
 When did you...? 
 This morning. 
 What is it? 
 I'll deal with it. Thanks. 
 Right. 
 That guy needs to unclench. 
 Come on, Earp. 
 There's no rest for the wicked. 
 Bobo, not to be awkward, but the boys are worried that we won't be crossing over. Again. 
 The dissenters will be punished. 
 Everything is in place. 
 [foreign language] 
 I said everything. 
 Now go press my pant suit. 
 Go. 
 Everything is in place, right, Cryderman? 
 Yes. An ice sculpture, champagne... 
 Rivers of champagne. 
 And the Wainwright? 
 See, why would you want that old hotel, when I can get you... [growling] 
 We got it. I was only asking, Bobo. 
 That is a Bobo no-no. 
 It's all exactly like you wanted, I swear. 
 Huzzah. 
 He lives to see another day. 
 [woman screaming in pain] 
 Please. Make it stop. 
 [screaming] 
 [plash] 
 [screaming] 
 Bravo. Bravo! 
 Bubs, you never disappoint. 
 [cooing] 
 Now, you see, right there. 
 Dial it back five percent, and our plan will be perfection. 
 [growling] 
 It's a happy day. Ah, ah! 
 [whistling] 
 Deputy Marshal Dolls. 
 Oh yeah? And what's your story, honey? 
 Well, for starters, my coat may be cute but it's way too thin for this weather, and then I totally forgot to exfoliate this morning and now I have to take the biggest whiz. 
 Mind if we step inside for just a sec? 
 Much as I'd like to see you with your panties off... you all can go screw yourselves a good day. 
 Oh God! You know littering is bad for the heart, right? 
 How's that? 
 Because when you litter... 
 Oof! 
 [groaning] 
 I hit you in the heart. 
 Storytime's over, bitch. 
 Come on, Earp. 
 Yes sir, Mr. Deputy Marshal. 
 I'm exhausted. 
 Hey... 
 I know, baby. 
 sh1t. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Sorry. 
 Wow. Wynonna never said anything about you being a... a gay. 
 Oh geez. You haven't told her. 
 I have to go. 
 Call me later. 
 Wynonna'd probably be pretty pissed if she found out you didn't tell her something like this, wouldn't she? 
 There it is. 
 You remember that beam? 
 When I was four, you caught me going through Daddy's drawer and you promised not to tell, if... I walked across that beam. 
 I didn't... 
 Daddy was... 
 What? 
 Attentive? 
 Huh? Aware of your birthday? 
 Willa, I could have broken my neck. 
 [shout] 
 I figured you all for human. 
 The Machetes don't discriminate. 
 Me either! 
 [shouting] 
 Welcome aboard the Earp Express. 
 Enjoy your trip to Hell. 
 That ain't working right. 
 It's fine. 
 Alright. Start talking, or I take your head for a spin. 
 Alright, alright! 
 So who hired you sacks of sh1t to kill me, huh? 
 The judge, man. Sometimes he hires us to pull jobs. 
 Cryderman. Where the hell is he? 
 And why does he want me dead? 
 I don't know. 
 We just picked up a bag of money from Shorty's, didn't ask for nothing but a picture for the hit. 
 [panting] 
 Well, I'm gonna need that bag. 
 [panting] 
 sh1t. If I'd known your life was worth this much... 
 We're giving it to charity. 
 [scoffing] 
 Of course. Puppies and orphans. 
 Perfect. 
 Dolls, something happened back there... 
 You did well. 
 OK? 
 Man... You know, when I first met you... 
 Girl, you were a mess. 
 Hey! 
 What? 
 "Hot." I prefer "hot" mess. 
 [complete exhalation] 
 Now I wouldn't want to fight with anyone else by my side. 
 I'm hungry, you hungry? 
 Look, I have to show you something, alright? 
 Dolls : Nedley found the car on the edge of the Ghost River Triangle. 
 It was pointed back towards Purgatory. 
 They said there was no body, so... 
 Earp, if anyone can get out of a burning car, it'd be Doc Holliday. 
 He'd only just learned to drive. 
 [whistling wind] 
 Ah! 
 You can't come here. 
 I'm not going to hurt you. 
 You already have. I can see it in your eyes. 
 One day, I'll remember how... and I'll come for you. 
 [gunshot] 
 Back the hell up or I'll shoot you for real, Bobo Del Rey. 
 You can't kill me. 
 No. 
 But I can bring the pain. 
 Hey! 
 I'm so sorry I made you walk on beams. 
 No, no. I'm sorry I called you a bitch. 
 In my head. 
 What's that? 
 I have no idea what it means. 
 I think I do. 
 [humming] 
 [sniffing, howling] 
 Oh! 
 [laughing] 
 Oh! 
 I'm a lucky man, happening on you like I done. 
 Yeah. Your knife skills are legendary. 
 I've been a fan for years. 
 Oh, it is so nice to meet an admirer. 
 And I must say, you are the spitting image of your brother, Vinnie. 
 You ratted him out to Wynonna. 
 Oh, bygones, my friend. 
 Bubba, isn't it? 
 Big Bubba. 
 Of course. 
 And I suspect from your fine chemistry skills, Mr. Bubba, that you are here on assignment. For whom? 
 I want a lesson. 
 I want answers. 
 And my hat. 
 Since we're opening up to one another. 
 Bobo Del Rey. 
 That's who hired me. 
 Any specifics on this "job?" 
 One question, one answer, one lesson. And I'm keeping the hat. 
 Of course. 
 Yah. 
 Yah... Well, this time... 
 Yah. Hem... 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Doc : ...plant your feet as though rooted to the very ground. 
 Now I beg of you, and I do mean beg, shoot from the elbow, not the shoulder. 
 I cannot emphasize this enough. 
 The elbow! 
 [laughing] 
 Very good, Mr. Bubba. 
 A faster learner there never was. 
 Yah. 
 Another drink, if you don't mind. 
 Ahh! Much obliged. 
 [panting] 
 Now, how long do you intend to keep me here? 
 Yah. Until they're gone. 
 Who? 
 Everyone. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Look, you don't have to do this, OK, right now. 
 Are you screwing with me? 
 Oh, God. 
 Someone got to Doc and they're trying to kill you, then they're winning. 
 And I will not let them win. 
 Look, we don't have to go in guns blazing. We have time. 
 Huh. Tell that to Cryderman. 
 What? Cryderman? 
 I think he's about to kill himself. 
 Hey! Quick! No! 
 I wanna die. 
 Oh, I want that for you too, Judge. 
 [sobbing] 
 But you gotta give answers first, crybaby. 
 You hired a bunch of ex-military bikers to assassinate me. 
 Why? 
 He forced my hand. 
 Who? 
 Bobo. 
 It's always been Bobo. 
 He cuts and I bleed. Money, dignity, my very soul. He's reduced me to nothing. 
 Aww. 
 The way you reduced so many young delinquents, huh? 
 Wow! Full circle. 
 Pure poetry. 
 You two could walk away from this prison. 
 I'm a lifer. 
 
 
 
 Dolls : You gotta start talking. 
 Bobo's throwing a party tonight at the old Wainwright. 
 I figured him for more retro roller rink, less heritage hotel. 
 He insisted. 
 Anything about a clue? A lead? 
 He's obsessed with that thing. 
 It's a thing? 
 So what is it? 
 Does he have it? 
 No idea. [sniffling] 
 Right. So, the Wainwright houses a bunch of antiques, right? 
 Maybe the lead could be there. 
 Wynonna : We get in there, get it first, there goes his ticket out of the Triangle. 
 Alright. You're gonna get us into that party. 
 Dolls : Do you not check your mail? 
 The whole town is invited. Black tie, no guns. 
 The whole town. 
 Yeah, everybody. 
 All of the town. 
 Even... yeah. 
 Great. Then you're coming with us, and you're going to help. 
 No, no, no. I can't. 
 Bobo will know I betrayed him. 
 We'll protect you, don't worry. 
 You can barely protect yourselves. Who are we kidding? 
 Yeah, well, sh1t happens. 
 sh1t happens. Ha! 
 I like that. 
 [gunshot] 
 [Bubba grunting] 
 Doc : The ground here tremors more than open fields. 
 But not enough for the Big City. 
 Purgatory, are we? 
 'Spose we are. 
 No doubt the powder there will play a significant part in one of Bobo's more nefarious plans. 
 The most significant part. It's complicated. 
 You know, there was a time when I fashioned my own gunpowder... and though the ratio of a perfect 75:15:10 was imperative, I found the secret was in crafting my own. 
 You made your own saltpeter? 
 Well, if you saw what this could do... 
 Son, I'm frickin' Doc Holliday. 
 Nothing impresses me anymore. 
 Well, frickin' 
 Doc Holliday... Ha! 
 There's a pleasant fragrance. Peaches? 
 Yeah. Peaches. 
 Hello! 
 [hissing] 
 Yah. Yah, yah, yah, yah. 
 No! 
 Shh, shh. 
 That's enough, there, little rabbit. 
 [retching] 
 Oh... oh... 
 Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
 [laughing] 
 Oh yah, yah, yah, yah! 
 Oh... 
 [laughing] 
 Wonderful. 
 [birds chirping] 
 Willa : No cabins, no boats, no people. 
 For a place with such a beautiful name, Swan Reservoir sure is creepy. 
 You recognize anything? 
 No. 
 Do you think this is where... 
 Yeah. 
 It's a protected bird sanctuary in the ever revenant-friendly Ghost River Triangle. 
 The perfect place to... cage a... 
 To cage a young bird. 
 Willa? 
 This is it. 
 Some cage. 
 The view's quite pretty. 
 Seriously? 
 I'm sorry. This is so many different kinds of horrible. I was learning how to ride a bike, and playing woodland princess after school, and you... 
 Maybe this wasn't a good idea. 
 [panting] 
 [creaking] 
 [panting] 
 A woman. 
 With a pink car. 
 A witch. 
 Constance Clootie. 
 Do you even know the definition of "free?" 
 You. Can. Go. 
 What did you do to my head? 
 Gave it a little cleanse. 
 All those pesky memories, gone. 
 You're better off without them, dear. Now come on. 
 Chop chop. 
 She may have rescued me... but I had no idea what price I would pay. 
 Your memories. 
 They're coming back now. 
 They are. 
 Oh my god, they are. 
 There's so much to do. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Dolls? 
 Why in the world would you need my dress size? 
 Hey. 
 This is what you'll be wearing to the Winter Solstice. 
 OK, cool. What does it do? 
 It covers your body. 
 Yeah, but is it bulletproof? 
 Does it have cameras in it? Sensors? 
 Yes, to none of those things. 
 I can bring my own damn dress. 
 You wearing your midriff-baring baby tee and your "good jeans" isn't really black tie. 
 We gotta blend in with the people of Purgatory, not scare them. 
 Ha! Bobo will do that. 
 Yeah. 
 Look at this. 
 Nothing but dark corners and lots of rooms. 
 Whatever he's planning, whatever he's looking for, it's a total mystery. 
 [A door opens.] 
 What part of "stay on the Homestead" didn't you understand? 
 We found it. 
 The Swan Reservoir. 
 The place I was kept all those years. 
 It was Bobo. 
 And these were scattered everywhere. 
 But then I was rescued. 
 Yeah, by Constance Clootie. 
 But she erased my memories. 
 Wynonna : Constance Clootie never does anything unless it benefits Constance Clootie. 
 There's more. 
 We have a deal? 
 Where have all the honorable men gone? 
 Dead, I suppose. 
 Your great-granddaddy Wyatt would never have aligned with a revenant. 
 I'm not Wyatt. 
 No sh1t. 
 But what's done is done. 
 So are we in agreement? 
 We have ourselves a deal. 
 Then the Lead is yours. 
 Bobo already has the lead. 
 Not according to Constance. What, did he lose it? 
 Well, clearly he's found it again. 
 Waverly : OK, none of this is clear to me. 
 We think the lead is at the hotel. 
 It's a trap. You realize that, right? 
 Look, he doesn't know that we know about the Lead. 
 Maybe we can get there before him. 
 We'll be outnumbered. 
 Nothing outnumbers three Earps. 
 I've bumped up against worse problems. 
 Yeah, but why bring Champ into this? 
 Dolls : We need all hands on deck. 
 Fine. But we make a plan, and we stick with it. Deal? 
 Deal. 
 Yeah, deal. 
 That's not what you're wearing, though, is it? 
 No. 
 Not wearing that either. 
 You're right! It's all in the elbow. 
 You are a master in the making. 
 Ha! 
 This is what we've been waiting for, is it? 
 Awesome. One more day, bro, and we're free. Bringing your new friend? 
 Makes one helluva trophy. 
 You talk too much. 
 Ha, ha, ha! I hear that. 
 It's going to be some party, though. sh1t is going down. 
 Wish we were there to see it. 
 Now you deliver that straight to Bobo. 
 There's a little bit extra. You can keep some for yourself. 
 It's real good fun, bro. 
 The whole thing? 
 Yah. 
 Just up the... 
 Yah, just up. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Here's hoping he chews his own tongue off. 
 Ah! 
 I lied. 
 It's all in the wrist. 
 Now, what was this about a party? 
 [guests chatting] 
 We have an agreement? 
 How could I say no? 
 But let's not let curiosity kill this cat. 
 Tell me why, Ward. 
 For my family. 
 I walk across with you and my girls are free from this curse. 
 Daddy said we're supposed to hide the letter. 
 I did. Willa, I swear. 
 The Lead. 
 Nicole : You are a vision. 
 Oh please, I didn't even have time to accessorize. 
 See, I knew I wore this bracelet for a reason. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, if we get out of here, we are getting dressed up way more often. 
 What do you mean, "if we get out of here?" 
 Um... 
 Just stay by the exits, OK? 
 Willa. 
 Hey, come. 
 I saw all that, you know. 
 Not now, Champ. 
 So you two are, like, together now, eh? That's disgusting. 
 [loud voice] Disgusting. 
 Waverly : OK, so I've counted thirteen vents in this room alone. 
 And how would Bobo use those to further his nefarious plan? 
 AC us to death? 
 I'm being serious. 
 So am I. Just, it all seems so harmless. 
 How could a party with so much bubbly be bad? 
 Champagne? 
 Thank you. 
 Can't we celebrate a little? 
 Celebrate what? 
 Being out. I'm sure you haven't been out in a while, and I haven't been out... ever. 
 Oh, God. I keep forgetting. 
 Am I, like, the most insensitive sister ever? 
 It's a tie. 
 I'm kidding! 
 It is kinda fun, though, right? 
 Anything can turn bad if revenants come around. 
 I don't feel safe without Peacemaker here. 
 Wynonna's still coming, right? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Dammit! 
 You in there somewhere? 
 Freezing. 
 OK. 
 Of all the days not to wear a bra. 
 I feel like a walking umlaut. 
 All for the cause. 
 Security? 
 No. 
 Metal detectors? 
 Nada. 
 Well, why did I just climb through the window? 
 What the hell is Bobo playing at? 
 Is that...? 
 Yeah. One bullet with Bobo's name on it. 
 Should he choose to show. 
 Willa : Oh, he'll show. 
 I can feel it. We'll be ready. 
 You'll be ready. You're in the crosshairs of a revenant. 
 The worst revenant. 
 Bobo comes looking for you? Bang. 
 Right between the eyes. 
 Wynonna... 
 Trust me. 
 "Dear Robert"... 
 Oh, holy... holy sh1t. Hem! 
 Wow. 
 Yep. 
 So whose stick I gotta yank to get a hanger and a coat check tag? 
 [dramatic music] 
 Can I just say... 
 Damn. 
 Told you I could get my own dress. 
 Yeah, you sure did. Jeez. 
 I also got this. 
 "Dear Robert"? 
 Yeah, fancy, right? 
 Yeah. You know, at one time, people used to... start conversations with something other than, "Yo, dummy." 
 But who's Robert Svane? 
 He was a close confidante of Wyatt's. 
 The letter's our... great-great-granddaddy's. Dated years after he was cursed. 
 And he confides everything. 
 How he was cursed when he killed the demon Clootie, how the Ghost River Triangle holds all revenants... 
 They have to cross over with the Earp heir and the heir has to go willingly on the Winter Solstice. 
 So that gives us less than twenty-four hours. 
 So the attack on the homestead...? 
 Was all a ruse. 
 It went wrong so quickly. 
 Because Bobo reneged. 
 They were never supposed to take you. 
 Dolls : Willa was just insurance. 
 But they underestimated Ward. They went after his daughter, then Wynonna grabbed Peacemaker, and all bets were off. 
 Waverly : So Bobo's gonna try again. Cross the Ghost River Triangle with the heir. But, guys, what's the Lead? 
 That's just it. The heir is the Lead. 
 Willa was right. 
 He had the Lead and then he lost it... lost her, to Constance. 
 Bobo saved Willa's life. He's been obsessed with her since she arrived in Purgatory. Guys, I'm... 
 I'm not the true Earp heir. 
 Willa is. 
 We have to get you out of here. 
 Oh, screw that. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Can we get Willa out the back? 
 Willa : I told you. 
 I'm done running away from that maniac. 
 Waverly : She's right. Running probably won't help. 
 Bobo could have taken her at any time. 
 So why the party then? 
 I don't know I've done ten laps of this place and I still have no clue. 
 But we have Peacemaker. 
 Wynonna : Remember, the letter says you'd have to go willingly. 
 OK, so we just sit here and wait? 
 Willa : Of course not. 
 We drink. 
 That's not the worst idea, right? 
 Come on. 
 You know, as soon as we break up, you just swoop in and steal my girl. 
 OK, lower your voice. Waverly doesn't belong to anyone. 
 Oh, yeah, blah blah blah feminism blah. 
 Champ! You're drunk. And apparently a raging homophobe. 
 Oh, you think this is because she's a girl? 
 OK, Champ, I think you've had enough. 
 Of course you're gonna take her side. 
 You know, every time I failed that preliminary law enforcement exam, she would say, "It's OK, Champ. You have nothing to prove." 
 But apparently that was a lie. She's dating a cop. 
 Well, I guess that would be their own private business. 
 Come on, son, let's get you out of here. 
 No! 
 [screaming] 
 Woman : Oh, my God! 
 Champ, are you on something other than bubbly? 
 Ho! Ho, ho, ho! 
 [exclamations] 
 [whistling] 
 But sip. Be cool. 
 Says the guy who eats salad for breakfast. 
 [laughing] 
 Ugh. I hate champagne. 
 The good news is, we know Bobo's plan. 
 If he's got it right. 
 He does. 
 Willa's the heir. 
 Just because she shot Peacemaker just like you... 
 Ha, ha! Not like me at all. 
 [sighing] Back at the bikers', there was this revenant. 
 Dolls, I tried to shoot him at five feet. 
 Peacemaker just... flickered and jammed. 
 Whatever our connection was... that gun's clearly made its choice. 
 Hey look, doesn't matter, OK? 
 Except I go back to being plain ole human. No offense. 
 [sighing] I just... 
 I never wanted this, but after a while... 
 I just felt... I just felt like it fit. 
 Like I was meant to be. 
 But I'm not... I'm not special. 
 I'm just some girl. 
 Hey. 
 You were never 'just' anything. 
 Guess I can go back to bumming around Europe, huh? 
 [chuckling] 
 If you think you're going somewhere, you're in for a whole lot of hurt. 
 Forget the gun. 
 You're one helluva deputy. 
 And Black Badge needs you. 
 Ahem! 
 Screw 'em. 
 I need you. 
 Doc? 
 [sniffing] 
 Peaches. 
 Wynonna, did you drink any of this? 
 What? 
 Did you? 
 No, why? What's going on? 
 I'm too late. Goddamn it. 
 We got to stop all these people from drinking the champagne now. 
 Bobo : Good evening. 
 Is everyone having a good time? 
 Well, I hope so, because I'm only gonna say this once. 
 Maybe twice. I haven't decided yet. 
 I have some good news and I have some bad news. 
 The good news... is there's an antidote. 
 To what, you ask? 
 Hi. 
 [glass shattering] 
 Well, you see... that's the bad news. 
 All this delicious bubbly that you've been drinking... like drunken pigs has been poisoned. 
 [murmurs] 
 You will all slowly go batshit crazy. 
 Exhibit A, Champ Hardy. 
 [man retching] 
 How you doin', Champ? 
 Not good! 
 One lucky contestant will receive the antidote. 
 All they have to do is bring me one person, dead or alive, and that one person is... 
 Ms. Wynonna Earp. 
 Have fun. 
 [murmurs] 
 [screaming] 
 Wynonna. 
 Get Willa out of here. 
 Go. 
 OK. Got it. 
 Quick. 
 Uh, Nicole, come with us. 
 Champ's right, Waves. You're dating a cop now. 
 We go where the danger is. 
 God, that's sexy. 
 Look, Nedley's calling backup. We're gonna contain this, OK? 
 OK. 
 You didn't drink the champagne, did you? 
 No. You? 
 No. 
 OK. 
 OK, go. 
 sh1t. Willa? WILLA! 
 [soft ballad] 
 Hey, baby. 
 Do you remember me now? 
 Yes, Robert. 
 I do.
