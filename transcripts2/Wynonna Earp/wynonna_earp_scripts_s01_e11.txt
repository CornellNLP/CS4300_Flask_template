 Previously on Wynonna Earp. 
 You're safe here amongst your sisters. 
 My name is Wynonna Earp. 
 Yeah. 
 [shouts] 
 Sorry I didn't tell you about stupid Bobo's stupid powers. 
 Looking for this? 
 I thought you were just happy to see me. 
 I am finished here, Waverly. 
 This was your plan the whole time? 
 You told me to learn to drive. 
 Waverly : I didn't mean leave Purgatory without a word! 
 You came back. I knew our connection was real. 
 [humming] 
 Ah! 
 What the hell was that? 
 The impossible. 
 Would you girls kindly get your butts in here! Willa! 
 ♪ ♪ 
 How much propofol did Dolls give her? 
 Enough to calm her down. 
 I thought she was gonna hyperventilate to death. 
 Yeah, I know how she feels. 
 How can a woman recently sprung from a hippie forest cult... 
 Be our big sister Willa? 
 I don't know her at all. 
 Dude, none of us do. How do you think she feels? 
 She doesn't even know she's herself, Wynonna, so... 
 Gus : Girls, please. 
 I know this is all... overwhelming, but it's also a second chance. 
 Good Lord! The whole town will be upended. 
 We can't tell anyone. 
 Not until we know for sure. 
 [knocking on door] 
 [door opening] 
 [sighing] It's about damn time. 
 [door closing] 
 Wynonna : Ah, blablabla. 
 "In conclusion, 44 markers tested with a sibling index of... blablablabla and indicated by these patterns." 
 You're sure? 
 I mean, science doesn't lie, right? 
 But nobody knows whose saliva sample this is or that you were comparing it to mine, right? 
 You know, her being here could be dangerous. 
 Hey, don't worry. Black Badge doesn't know anything, OK? 
 Plus I got a buddy down in the forensics lab who did a no-questions-asked... favour. 
 But you don't believe me. 
 Only the part about you having a buddy. 
 If she really is our long-lost sister, then... 
 Technically, she's the heir. 
 Or an heir. Then, there'd be both of you. Two of you. 
 I was just gonna say, if she really is Willa, then we stopped looking for her a long time ago, and we're really horrible people, but... 
 [Willa gasping] 
 Get... Eve. 
 Yeah, it's OK, you're safe. 
 It was real, wasn't it? 
 I killed a man. 
 Lou got pulled into the ground. 
 He didn't get pulled into the ground. You sent him to Hell. 
 Hell? 
 Well, she did. 
 [Wynonna sighs.] 
 I-I think I should go. 
 Dolls : Whoa, whoa, you can't go anywhere. 
 Sorry. 
 Excuse me, I don't want to be rude, but I don't know... any of you. 
 Or what's happening. 
 Here, have a drink. 
 I don't drink. 
 You will. 
 'Cause according to the fresh-out-of-the-oven DNA test, you... are officially an Earp. 
 Welcome home, Willa. 
 Now, Zed, don't, as in do not, make eye contact with them. 
 They've been in storage for about a year; they'll be hungry. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 You need help with those bolt cutters or should I stand here all day? 
 [ominous music] 
 Hello! 
 woman : Help me! 
 The boss will be real mad if we don't get what he needs. 
 woman : Please help. 
 Oh sh1t! There's something wrong with 'em. 
 Maybe they're sick. Come on, Zed. 
 Jesus, what happened to you? 
 Ah! 
 That's what people would ask you if you survived. 
 Shut your eyes, Zed! 
 Oh! Take me. 
 I think I'm in love. 
 That'll change.

 This is... was my bedroom? 
 Yeah. Dolls thought this might activate some memories. 
 Looks like I liked horses. 
 I guess every little girl likes horses. 
 Oh, I didn't. 
 They don't like me. Haha! 
 I remember him. Mr. Plumpkins. 
 Poor guy is missing an eye. 
 Yeah. 
 My big sister used to steal him from me and torture him for ransom. 
 Alright, my bad. 
 Not you. 
 All this time I was missing... our parents never redecorated? 
 Mom was already long gone by then, and Daddy... had passed. 
 Anything memory-wise? 
 A switchblade. 
 What kind of people give a kid a switchblade? 
 Unless I was dangerous. 
 More like... special. 
 I think I'll take a shower. 
 Is that OK? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 This is your home, Willa. 
 Oh, it's just... just the cult. 
 Free living au naturel. 
 It's groovy. 
 Wynonna  (sighs): She hates us. 
 She doesn't know us. 
 Ah! 
 [door opening and closing] 
 Uh, gotta go. 
 Yeah, I said I'd see Nicole before the Poker Spectacular. 
 Are you and Nicole best friends now? 
 And what the hell is a "Poker Spectacular"? 
 Stuck in Purgatory for another goddamn Poker Spectacular. 
 [clicking] 
 There was a whore I knew, used to poke her spectacular. 
 I find my lead out there, I don't have to listen to your goddamn awful jokes in here again. 
 Concentrate, Del Rey, I got six whales coming into town. A lot of cash. 
 They expect a certain type of service. 
 A certain level of sophistication. 
 Details I certainly don't care about, you pompous twat. 
 Suddenly, you don't care about making money? 
 What do I care for money? In four more days, I'll be in the wind. 
 Ha! You say that every year. 
 Cryderman. 
 Got it for you, like I said I would. 
 A small taste of things to come. 
 Hello, babies. 
 [indistinct rock song playing] 
 [Bobo sniffing] 
 I'll need more than this. 
 On the way. 
 You lock up law enforcement? 
 Don't I always? 
 What about Black Badge? 
 I'm handling it. 
 I promise. 
 I put a lot of stake in a man's word, Cryderman. 
 But I no longer find the exploits of Wynonna Earp and Deputy Marshall Dolls particularly entertaining. 
 Speaking of entertainment... 
 The twins are locked and loaded. 
 You want your Johnson serviced before we part ways? 
 Nice try. I'll see myself out. 
 Sad Bobo is my least favourite Bobo. 
 Is there anything we can do to make it better, baby? 
 Not my types. 
 Then again... it's goddamn Poker Spectacular.

 Why not?

 Mr. Stokes, welcome to my humble little town. 
 With this high a buy-in, Judge... I don't think humble will cut it. 
 What's a high-stakes poker game without the stakes? 
 All cash then? 
 I'm gonna check in my hotel, relax a little bit before the games begin. 
 I made sure you were in our most prestigious room. 
 It's to die for. 
 I'll be the judge of that. 
 Wynonna : How is this even possible? 
 I still can't believe it. 
 Feels like a piece that's been missing from our lives. 
 And now it's back. 
 Last time I saw her, she was being pulled out a window. 
 I didn't do a damn thing. 
 We couldn't. 
 We shouldn't have given up, Gus. 
 Oh, we didn't think we had. 
 After six months of searching... we found part of Willa's nightgown coated in dried blood. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 Well, it was a Thursday. 
 I remember 'cause you'd just been released from St. Victoria's. 
 Tried to burn down your classroom. 
 Ms. Hanson called my diorama an aberration. 
 Stayed up all night handcrafting those little papier-mâché demons. 
 This is crazy. 
 You don't look a miracle in the mouth, Wy. 
 This could heal us all. 
 We need to get her memories back, and I don't have a magic pill for that. 
 You could start by telling me the truth. 
 I did. 
 Gus : The whole truth. 
 Oh, I'd hate to see their second best, hmm? 
 What the f...! 
 We've been waiting for you. 
 It's been so long since we've had a man. 
 A real man. 
 [man grunting]

 Oh, hello. 
 [woman moaning]

 Oh, that feels amazing! 
 Ah, aaaah! 
 That's, that's a little tight.

 We gotta get this to Bobo. Hurry up.

 [gunshots] 
 Demons? 
 Like Beelzebub and Lucifer? 
 Hell no. 
 Hell yes, apparently. 
 And that's where they come from? 
 And where we send 'em back. 
 These revenants are the bad guys Wyatt Earp put down. 
 When they resurrect... they come back demon-adjacent. With powers. 
 Are there any Angels? 
 Sure. Snow, Charlie's and Los. 
 [Wynonna chuckling] 
 How can you think this is funny? 
 How can you not? This curse, our burden; if you don't laugh... you'll go crazy. And I've been crazy. 
 Didn't care for it. 
 You hate having to do this. 
 What would it make me if I didn't? 
 Here's the kicker. I was never supposed to be hunting revenants or... breaking curses. 
 It was supposed to be you. 
 [clicking] 
 Daddy, it's 4 in the morning, and I have school tomorrow. 
 Every one of your little classmates will be slaughtered if you don't learn to protect them. 
 This town. Your sisters. 
 Now aim. 
 Don't hesitate. 
 Because they sure won't. 
 DO IT!

 Willa, do you remember what happened after you were taken? 
 No. Just, just being kids. 
 And Daddy training me to be the heir.

 Wynonna, where the hell have I been? 
 Hey, Earp. Oh, uh... 
 Wynonna Earp. 
 Yeah, we got something.

 Doc Holliday  (chuckling): Well see, here's the clinker: I got angry; I threw them keys away. 
 Now, I looked for 'em for a spell, but then I decided tired eyes, they're poor tools, so... 
 In which direction did you throw 'em? 
 Just past that marker. 
 Uh-huh.

 Yeah, you sure did, son. 
 This mean you help me? 
 Oh, where are my manners? 
 Henry. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Willa : You kept my death certificate. 
 Yeah. To remind myself it was actually real. 
 You know, that you were actually gone. 
 I was 6, right? 
 I saw the little white coffin, but I knew that you weren't actually in there. 
 They'd filled it with sandbags. 
 Was it a nice service? 
 All I remember was a lot of crying. 
 And the food. 
 The grown-ups let me eat as many marshmallows as I wanted. 
 I threw up all night long. 
 Gee.

 Alright, so Nedley caught a scene at the hotel. 
 Blood everywhere, but no body. 
 Cool. 
 Yeah. So only thing left was a laptop belonging to a guy by the name of Bradley Stokes. Hedge-fund type from Seattle. 
 Hmm, cool. 
 Nicole searched for any connected devices and came across an active smartwatch currently transmitting from this abandoned railyard. 
 And let me guess. 
 [cocking shotgun] 
 You cool? Now you snap out of it, alright? 
 Yeah, I wonder what's got me so distracted, right? 
 Look, the guy may still be alive in there, and I'm gonna need your help. OK, Wynonna? 
 Come on! 
 You're the Earp that I need right now. 
 Try the only one who'll fall for your bullshit. 
 Alright, so the smartwatch is transmitting from in there. 
 OK. 
 What? 
 Daddy trained Willa. 
 She was prepared to do this. 
 Unlike me, the off-key drunk of an understudy. 
 Whoa, whoa, look. You know you're good at this, and you're only getting better, OK? 
 Thanks.

 Doc : I sure appreciate your care. 
 Well, I looked in my truck, and it just so happened that I had a fan belt for a '78. 
 This is your lucky day, son. 
 Oh, I try to make my own luck. 
 Well, you can't fix your own car. 
 You kids today and your "iPodes" and your "Netpix"... 
 You couldn't find a sparkplug if your life depended on it. 
 I do like your hat, though. 
 Much obliged. 
 So, where are you headed? 
 Ooh, wherever suits me. 
 I've always been a bit of a drifter. 
 Suppose some find that something to be proud of. My experience says drifting is just another word for running. 
 Running ain't in my nature. 
 Well, maybe it didn't use to be, but enough time in the dark... a man can change. 
 What did you say? 
 Or maybe it's a woman. 
 Well, it ain't. 
 You ever spend any time at war, son? 
 My father did a long time ago. You? 
 On my first tour of duty, I couldn't wait to get home. 
 Then I did. I couldn't figure out what to do with myself. 
 So I went back... to the desert. 
 Nothing hollows out a man quicker than completing a mission. 
 Because after that... you still gotta live. 
 Dig into that toolbox and fetch me a 5H socket, would you? 
 When did you finally give it up? 
 I didn't. 
 [echoing] Neither have you, Doc.

 Oh, men, I need to start drinking less. 
 Or much, much more. 
 Hot chocolate? 
 What are you playing at? 
 I'm not sure what you mean, son. 
 How in hell did you get this? 
 Why? Is it something to you? 
 This is Wyatt Earp's deputy badge. He gave this to me. 
 And I threw it in a fire many weeks ago, far from here. 
 Sounds to me like you were done with it. 
 No more bullshit. 
 Now, who are you? 
 Who sent you? 
 Questions with complicated answers. 
 For simplicity's sake, you can call me Juan-Carlo. 
 And nobody sent me. 
 I just am. 
 Well, if not a revenant, then what? 
 You keep asking all the wrong questions. 
 But then again, most people do. 
 What am I even doing here? 
 That's more like it. 
 My associates and I have a vested interested in what you call the Ghost River Triangle. 
 You only have four days until Winter Solstice. 
 Well then, I'll be sure to raise a glass of spiked cider to your enigmatic ass. 
 Four days until the door opens. And if it does, she will lose, Doc. 
 Even with your help. 
 You have to choose. 
 Keep drifting on down the road or face the darkness again. 
 This time with Wynonna Earp at your side. 
 Not everyone gets a second chance. 
 Most of them stay in the ground. 
 Well, I ought to put you in the ground. 
 Well... 
 That'd be a choice, too. 
 Speaking of... 
 You can take the fan belt... or the badge... but you can't have both. 
 What were you thinking, showing Willa her own scrapbook of death? 
 She was curious. 
 Wouldn't you be curious? 
 Well, it freaked her out! 
 Yeah, more like pissed her off.
