 Previously on  Wynonna Earp. 
 Why did you even come back, Wynonna? 
 Haven't the people who love you suffered enough? 
 You said they can't attack the house! 
 They figured out how to get around the bedrock! 
 Wynonna :  Hey, sis! 
 Starting again, isn't it? 
 We need that gun! 
 Wyatt Earp christened it Peacemaker. 
 Something awful is happening in Purgatory. It has everything  to do with my last name! 
 Deputy Marshall Dolls. 
 We monitor specific activity. 
 What kind of activity? Demons.  They can blend in. They look just like us. Welcome to the Black Badge Division. (loud house music playing) ♪♪ So I'll hold on ♪ 
♪ I'll never surrender ♪ 
♪ And our love's strong ♪ 
♪ This is forever ♪♪ Like it or not, you are now consultant deputy for the Black Badge Division. You need to be smart, discreet. Especially when you're hunting demons. Revenants. Wyatt Earp's kills; Daddy called them revenants. Are you sure this is one of 'em? Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! OK? Government issue... and a lot more accurate. Jesus Christ! Woops! Sorry. Fancy but powerless. Pretty sure only Peacemaker can send revheads back to Hades. You don't know that for a fact. Wanna bet? Loser buys dinner? No. You lose, you die. OK? Besides, I don't gamble. You're sending in your best agent... My only agent. ...with the wrong gun that.... Now, that sounds like a gamble to me. Good luck. You're not coming? Consider this your first solo mission. Don't blow it. I never blow jobs without a please first. That joke kills with the Hell's Angels. There's something wrong with you. Conceal your weapon! sh1t! Yes, OK. (house music playing) Damn Earps! Always interrupting my good time. (woman screaming) Special deputy! Cross-border task...! CRAZY CHICK WITH A GUN! (people screaming) Hey, this ain't Wyatt's gun! Ugly and dumb. You sure we haven't dated? (grunting) (bone cracking) Ugh! Bad revenant! Stay! (people screaming) Yep... She better be dead. This is for what you did to my family. Earp, no! (people screaming) What happened to discreet, huh? Discreet went out the window when Red started snacking on lady fingers. (A woman screams.) sh1t! Go, get him! Great, we lost him. Well, you lost him! Black Badge is about flying under the radar; you flew over the radar in a flaming, pink jet. You made a spectacle of yourself, Deputy. Pink? Yeah, pink! How dare you! And you owe me dinner. Seriously, I won the bet so... I'll settle for tacos. (clicking) Ow! Dammit! (deep voice): What is the target? Very well. You are it. (man screaming) ♪♪♪ 
♪♪ 'Cause I gave you all I've got to give ♪ 
♪ And no, that ain't no way to live ♪ 
♪ I told that devil ♪ 
♪ To take you back ♪ 
♪ I told that devil to take you back ♪♪ (sigh) (motorcycle roaring) (indistinct chatter) Well, I seem to have settled amongst a commune of artists. (indistinct chatter) (motorcycle roaring) (indistinct rock song playing) How are those bullet holes healing? Better than your face. Not to worry, gents, the new heir is sporting tits, a rabid case of nymphomania, and the wrong gun. She's got Peacemaker. How long we gotta wait till Boss has her taken out? I do beg your pardon, but you gentlemen seem to be having the most delightful game of five-card brag, and I would surely love to buy in. It's called Texas Hold 'em. Rules have changed a lot since your day. Oh, I reckon I'd pick it up. You ain't picking up sh1t. We know who you are... and who you rode alongside of. Then what better opportunity to make me pay for my poor choices in friends than by taking all of my earnings? (indistinct chatter) Alright. ♪ Yeah, we do it again and again and again ♪ Despite our trip to the big city, Wyatt's revenants seem to be concentrated here in Purgatory, so this will be our battleground. I'm telling you, none of these are gonna work. The Black Badge was a top-secret branch of the Marshalls founded in the 1900s by Roosevelt... Eleanor? Teddy... to eradicate the paranormal forces suddenly blossoming on North American soil... Do you have a flamethrower? 'Cause a flamethrower is at least fun. ...working with your grandfather actually, Edwin Earp, to handle things up here. Hmm... yeah. A one-year wonder. Family legend has it Eddie was only the heir for like 11 months, but came real close to sending all 77 of Wyatt's kills back to Hell. (crows cawing) 77, huh? That's how many outlaws we'll have to put down? Yeah, give or take a 7. So what about your dad? How many revenants did he...? Not enough. Ah. Well now, they're gonna have to deal with you. Right after you deal with the sh1t ton of paperwork you generated after last night's disastrous takedown. OK. Like, one blonde broke a heel, and I was trying to smoke the revenant. Aaah! Our number 1 priority is to keep the public from learning they exist. People here deserve to know what they're up against, even if most of these people are dicks who hate me. If the public know that demons are out there... widespread panic. OK. Have a little faith. We've survived hotdog-stuff crust pizzas, so I think we got this. What is that? Maldito, New Mexico. The last town to realize they were under siege from hellspawn. It's a crater. That's all that was left after they dispatched the Tomahawk missiles. To beat the bad guys? To contain the story. You want this to happen to Purgatory? Normal dudes carry baby pictures in their wallet. Normal's in the past, Deputy. You're Black Badge now. (techno music playing) WHOOO! Waverly : Love you! Alright, Mr. Know-it-all, tell me what my sister sees in that d-bag? I couldn't tell you; I don't do relationships. How about smiling? You ever do that? Hmm? (people laughing) See, but it wasn't the whore's burgundy corset that gave me pause, gentlemen, nor was it the healthy merkin perched between that sweet dove's legs. No, it was that she had a tail. An honest-to-goodness tail as perky as a pretty puppy dog's But it wasn't wagging, so I was game. (people laughing) Why, Levi. Back for more? I've been keeping your stake warm for you. Bossman wants to see you. Well, it is about time. Gentlemen. Ugh! You really are a hard fella to get ahold of. But it's good to know that once I have your attention, I really, really... Aaah! Godammit! Sh! I thought we had an understanding, Hank. You were to keep to the outskirts of my park. Well, I like attention. I always have. When you were a man? I still am a man with a very specific skillset, one I seek to exploit to financial gain with a man such as yourself. You ain't one of us. (exhaling) But I could be. You know... better you and yours to follow the old codes than these modern-day people who follow none. And the Earps? It is just a matter of time before they figure out who I really am and what I did to their great-great-granddaddy. Alright, I'll ante up. Now, you fetch me something of theirs, something that lets me know what they're up to, and I'll give you... what you really want. Hahaha! And what is that? Revenge. (motorcycle roaring) (blues song playing in the background) You sure that's OK, Gus? You were just in the hospital. No, it's medicinal. No weapons at the table. "Medicinal," nice. Ah! Oh! Hey. Hey... Frida Kahlo. Look what I found at the homestead. Awww! No way! Aw, I loved colouring. Hey, look, here's one of Mom, Dad, and Willa. Who is this nutsack? Language, Wynonna. My imaginary friend. You adorable psycho. Haha! What was his name again? Bongo? Bill... Bilbo? Where's my head? I forgot the carrots. The revenants that took you; recognize them from your research? Hmm, no. Well, I was kind of busy trying to breathe. Hey, but listen, if I joined Black Badge, I could bring my research and my amazing banana muffins. No! Did you see the bruises on my back from last night's clubbing? Dude, I didn't even tequila. Yeah, but you shot the guy. Right? Yeah, but I didn't quite put him down. (door opening) Oh... (door closing) Yeah, yeah, you think? Tell me where Peacemaker is, and I'll kill your sister fast. It's in my panty drawer. Why don't we go get it? (buzzing) Get away from my girls, you nutsack! Hey, you stay out of this, Gus! Like hell I will! Wynonna, get the gun! Wh-what?! What gun? Where gun? (dramatic music) Bossman said I'd never take it from you. Can't wait to prove him wrong. No! (sizzling sound) Get it off! Get it off! It burns! (revenant screaming) Red... Red? (cocking the gun) We're gonna get you. "We"? Maybe. "You"? Doesn't look great. Yah! (Red growling and screaming) Cleanup, aisle 3. I'll get a cloth. (sigh) ♪♪♪ YA! Jesus! Jesus! Argh! ♪ All that preach ♪ Perfect. I didn't know Shorty's had wet t-shirt competitions. You OK? Yeah. Yeah. I, uh... Just a bit jumpy. Had a... a crazy night. Sorry I wasn't here to see it. I've been, uh... I've been meaning to introduce myself. I'm Nicole. Nicole Haught. Hi. And you are Waverly Earp. Yes. Quite a popular girl around here. Oh, you know, it's all in the smile and wave. Yeah. Can I get a cappuccino to go? Oh, I'm really sorry. Um, we're not actually open yet so... Oh! Right! Again, my bad. It's just when I see something I like, I don't want to wait. And your door was open so... Right. God... Oh, God, I'm sopping wet. (Nicole laughing) You know, I keep telling Shorty he needs to fix the darn taps. Sorry, do you mind just, uh...? Oh. I'm gonna... wear a hat so... ♪ My heart is yours ♪ (tearing sound) Oh! Oh, crap! Um... Uh, uh, officer, I'm stuck so, please... Oh yeah. Let me help you. (Waverly chuckling) I got you. Oh. Oh, God! Good job you're not some guy, right, or this would be really, really awkward... ♪ Hold your tongue ♪ Uh... Um... I-I owe you one. Alright, well, how about you buy me that cup of coffee? How about tonight? Oh, I can't. No? No. I mean, I'd love to, but... like, like to, uh... but I have plans. Yeah. I'm a planner. I like to know what I'm doing at least two or three days in advance. I'm... I'm in a relationship. With a boy. Man. A boy-man. Yep, I've been there. Haha! It's the worst. OK, well, some other time. I mean it. ♪ The less you know ♪ 
♪ Na na na ♪♪ 
♪♪♪ "Officer Haught." Of course. "Classified," my ass! These are Purgatory Sheriff's Offices; you can't just commandeer them! Fine, I'll let you share the kitchen. Let me?! Look, our funds have been slashed in half, I've got one rookie officer on the roster. I even buy the coffee myself! Look, I'm running a cross-border task force, working on a joint investigation into a sophisticated criminal syndicate, a syndicate that is wreaking havoc under your do-nothing nose, Sheriff, and you're worried about me poaching your French roast? I called Washington, and I called Ottawa; nobody's even heard of your division! It's like the whole thing has been... Classified? Consider yourself on a need-to-know basis from this point forward, Nedley. And all you need to know is that I've checked your fridge... and your cream's expired. ♪♪ I was down to the ground ♪ We take cash. Or credit card or cash, or personal cheque or certified cheque or... stop me if I'm repeating myself... cash. We do not take pirate booty or whatever these are. OK. Don't worry, Shorty, I got this. I know him. I keep telling her, you don't have to be nice to everybody. Oh, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not sure I do know you. And I would remember a face like yours. (laughing): OK. Hi. I'm Waverly. And don't do that, I have a big, burly boyfriend who can bring a calf to its knees in 8 seconds flat. Oh, my! He sounds positively harrowing. I know what you're here for. Really? Yeah. I can spot you groupies a mile away. You know, the fake Old West getup, the awe-struck reverence while you gaze upon his saddlebags... I m... I mean I totally get it, right? You wanna keep his memory alive. You wanna drink where Wyatt Earp drank! Wyatt didn't drink; he preferred ice cream. Uh, well, who doesn't, right? I'm an Earp. I-I m... I mean... I mean, "Earper." I'm an "Earper" too. Yeah. Found most of this stuff myself. Don't you try to go up against me on eBay now. Oh, I wouldn't dream of it. You know, I've got Wyatt's original holster up in my apartment. Yeah. ♪ I was down to the ground ♪ Oh, which I am definitely not inviting you up to by the way. You are so not my type. Darlin', I'm everybody's type. So you sleep here too? It's a shame a pretty thing like you never gets to leave the saloon. You know what? There. Covered you out of my tips. I did not ask you to. No. Didn't need to. I got a good feeling about you. And I'm an excellent judge of character. Sweetheart... you really aren't. ♪ Break it up, break it up ♪♪ Only Peacemaker puts 'em down for good. Long as I hit 'em between the eyes. Oh! And revenants can't physically hold it. Not without vibrating faster than a... You know. I have my toys; you have yours. Anyway. Regular guns can slow the revheads down, but they will always come back for more until they meet Peacemaker, which only I can handle... (gun clattering on floor) Yep, in theory. Look. I've been attacked four times in the last three days, OK? The homestead, Shorty's, I'm a... I need a safe place to regroup and sleep. As long as you don't leave town. (knocking twice on door) Hey! Check it out: another piping hot delivery from... Wow, "CSIS." Oh, I'm Nicole. Officer Haught. Y'all getting settled in alright? What is all this stuff? Nice to meet you, Officer Haught. If you ever enter my offices again without knocking, I'm gonna have you arrested for treason. OK? Nice to meet you too. She did knock, Dolls. You sure you didn't want to threaten her with death? Penalty for treason is death. It was implied. I know. Red tried to get ahold of Peacemaker; it fried him from the inside out! Then-then Earp picked it up and-and-and Red... Caught a one-way ticket down south, right? Let me see if I got this straight. Malcolm kills her uncle, lures the heir back home, and now this? How many times do I got to tell you idiots? Peacemaker can't be touched by revenant hand. But-but we-we just thought... Don't! Ever! Think! I do the thinking... for all of us. You hear me? Now, you wanna get out of here, Levi? You wanna escape the Triangle, feast on everything and everyone? Hell, yes. Boss, it's all I want! It's good. So what we do... is we create a distraction... we bring in professional help. If we wanna hire him... we need a mortal's blood, willingly given. None of our human familiars will risk it! So we need a sucker. OK. Why, I just happen to have one... and he's mighty keen to impress me. Now, what does one get for the demonic sociopath that has everything? A braver man would suggest mouthwash. But hello... (chuckle) "Lonny Riggs, Henry Starr, Cole Younger" She's got the who's who of outlaws in here. Lord Almighty! (door opening) Whoever you are, you're robbing my sister's place, and that's a bad move, revenant. Son of a bitch! Crap! So he was fast. ♪♪♪ 
 
 I love what you've done with the place. Another rendezvous so soon? I suppose I should be flattered. Now, did you bring me something of the Earps? I'm working on it. 'Cause you're gonna enlist someone who's gonna take care of the heir. And once she's dead, you're gonna bring me her gun. Unless you got a problem with that? The only one about to have a problem is Wynonna. Now, what exactly does this entail? (scoffing) What is this revenant's raison d'être? Do I know him? His name's Jim Miller. Killed his grand-parents, brother-in-law, then anyone he was paid to. Called him Killer Miller. I remember. Rumor has it was Miller, not Robert Ford, who put down Jesse James. Well, Robert Ford was an awful shot. It was always said, Miller moved like a shadow. Now he is one. Shadow assassin who can only be activated via blood sacrifice. You outlaws sure have gotten dramatic since you were human. The Shadow's as far from human as it gets. You know, the real question is: what the hell are you? Still me. Don't be jealous. Not jealous. I'm disgusted. You were Wyatt Earp's right hand; what would he say if he knew you were joining forces with every man he ever put down? The dead don't get a vote. Now, are we doing this or what? Hey, I got all 34 of your texts. Your apartment's been broken into; you can't go back. Oh, what?! But my yoga mat is there! Well, it's not safe, and neither is Gus' or Shorty's or the back of Champ's pickup. Ewww! This place used to be. Remember when Mama made these windchimes? Do you remember? This was a home then. You know? Never saw anything scarier than an albino gopher. Until the attack where half of us died. Oh, hey, Marshal Dolls! How old were you when the revenants invaded the homestead? 12. 6. And they'd never done it before? Maybe they were scared of our dad. Or physically unable to step foot on Earp land. What... Hey, that's... Ammonite. This mineral found around here? I j... Unless you can smoke it, I really wouldn't know. You want a safe place? This stuff might explain why your ancestors built this house here. A house that doesn't have running water and smells like skunk hiney? Yeah, I'll... I'll be in my car. It's tough for her... being the youngest? Yeah. She was 4 when Mama left. She just up and moved away. Maybe it runs in the family. Anyways, you got a good look at the thief at Waverly's? Better yet, a shot? (scoffs) Yeah, I did, but he was better. Better than what? You two look around the homestead. See if you see anything unfamiliar, something occult-ish. (scoffs) Occult...? That is so specifically vague. You want a safe place to lay your head for you and your sister? Keep your eyes open, Earp. For trouble? That too. You really think Jim Miller can dispatch the heir? I've seen Ms. Earp at work up close. She is quick. And tough too. She might surprise you. Yeah. The Shadow's real particular on payment: mortal blood. You say you're still human... Hold this. Looks like it's my turn to befoul... someone else's abode. (wind howling) (deep, growling voice): What is the target? No! I can't! I won't go back in the dark! Give Miller his orders! Toss in something of the heir so he knows who the real target is! You could not have acquainted me with those particulars earlier? I have nothing on my person that belongs to Wynonna Earp! (Shadow growling) (deep voice): She will be mine. What... was that? He who moves amongst the shadows and delivers us the darkness. The bitch heir will never survive. Lord knows her daddy didn't. Except that wasn't. I tossed Miller something that belonged to Wynonna's sister. His mark is Waverly. That sweet little thing? You must really hate the Earps. OK, so what exactly are we looking for? Something strange and hard to explain. Like your relationship with Champ. Pfft! You're hardly qualified to give relationship advice. Remember that guy with the satanic-face tattoo? What? Phil really loved Norwegian death metal. Oh, sure. Look, Waverly... Hohohoho! Willa, age 10... Wynonna, age 7. Hmm... I'm not on there, am I? Probably rubbed off. Yeah. It's what I used to tell myself. (generator powering down) (cell phone ringing) Yeah? It's not ammonite,   it's ammolite. Pfft! Amateur mistake. Prized by the Blackfoot for its ability to ward off evil. Which it probably did when you guys were growing up. So I looked at the survey, and the homestead's built on a bedrock of the stuff. Whoa, Dolls, slow down. Remember that occult something I told you to find? It's a talisman made from vertebrae and bound by iron twine. Ew! We haven't found anything like that. It'll be in the ground. Buried to counteract the ammolite. Dolls, the homestead is 10 acres; we can't dig for it all ni... Night... seems to have fallen awful early. It's dark out there? Yeah. The sky's gone all weird. Same at the cop shop? No. Eclipse? Storm? Revenant? Just stay near a light source. Why? What's coming? Me. I'm 30 minutes out. I'll be there, Earp. (Beep!) (sigh) God! I swear, I can't get this flashlight lit! Hey, what do you say to a good, old-fashioned cookout? God! How can it be dark already? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon. It's Purgatory. Wait 20 minutes, we'll be slathering on the sunscreen. So what did Dolls say again about the talisman being... Buried in the ground. Buried... man : The witching hour. Perfect time to make a hole for our friend Waverly. Will this really make them happy? man : This will guarantee you all get what you deserve. Bobo. The name of my imaginary friend when I was growing up: Bobo! And I'm starting to think that he wasn't so imaginary. (wind howling) Ohhh... God, that's super weird. What's going on? The yard light's out. I'll check the generator. What?! What... Wynonna, what's going on?! Nothing. Just go inside. Waverly, go! (growling) (generator humming) (deep, growling voice): Your hair smells like lilies. The flower of funerals. Worst pickup line ever. (unsettling music) (Wynonna panting) (footsteps) DIE! OK. Creepy giant revenant alert! Moves through shadows, sucks in light, whispers things very high on the disturb-o-meter. You need to hide. What?! No! No way! Just until I get Peacemaker back. You "lost Peacemaker?! Just get in a closet, under the bed, anywhere the darkness can't find you. Those are the dark places! And hiding didn't help me last time! (girl screaming) (revenant laughing) (girl screaming) Shadowman is one of the revenants that took Daddy and Willa. Oh, God. If that sh1t ticket thinks he's coming in here uninvited again... OK. Oh, I love when you say "sh1t ticket." OK, where is this thing? What? Waverly, behind you! (Waverly screaming) Oh, my God! (Waverly panting) OK. Oh, sh1t. Oh, God! Q-q-q-quick! Quick, OK? (engine troubles) Come on, you stupid junker! Hello. Oh, God! I think he is draining the battery! Run! I'll hold him off. No! No way! This is Earp land, our land! We can't hold off revenants from it. Not until we find the talisman... I know because I'm the one who buried it. Well, good idea, but we'll never cross the fence line. He probably couldn't! No! He said it had to be an Earp! That if I buried the talisman in the pet cemetery, it would stop Mom and Dad from fighting! Move your butt, girl! (Shadow growling) It's here, beside Picachu the hamster's final resting place. Right. Oh, God, I can't see a thing! Hey! Hey! Hey, Dolls, listen. Scary-light-sucking-demon-on-our-ass. I know. I get the gist. End it, you're the only one that can. Shadow : Yes. dig your own graves. (gunshot) What was that metallic sound? Jim Miller! Yeah, Killer Miller used to wear a plate, an old-time bulletproof vest! It's gotta be him! Why, your research is impeccable. Thank you. What are you doing? Cover me? ♪♪♪ Hey! Big and tall! (Miller growling) Over here, freak nuts! Come get it! OK. (deep, growling voice): You are not the target. Bobo will be sad to lose you, little sister... Waverly is the target! What?! Why? Lights out, bitch. (gunshot) (strange growling) Find that talisman! WHOO! This just got crazy! Hey, guys, don't worry about me. I got this! Wynonna! Move! (Levi grunting) (hit) Having an axe for anything but wood maintenance is a felony. Hey, sis, finish him! No! ♪♪♪ I need him to send a message. I'm a dead man anyway. Just do it. Tell your boss, whoever he is, that I'm coming for him, coming for all the revenants who attacked the homestead and took Willa. The Seven? That hunting party's got three dead heirs under their belts. You're just a girl. (heroic music) I am  the  girl with the big-ass gun. And one by one, I am going to blow you all to Hell. (grunting) Got it! OK! Batter up! (Levi screaming) (Waverly laughing) It worked. Oh, come on, that was hilarious! How did you know about the ammolite? Been battling demons for a while now. Yeah, how does a big-city boy end up here, working for Black Badge? I was recruited from the military. For your awesome sense of humor? Because I'm very good at killing very bad guys. ♪♪♪ If people here find out that this is ground zero in a paranormal war, will you really do to Purgatory what you did in New Mexico? I didn't give the orders to nuke Maldito. I did everything I could to stop it. Dolls... Go home. And get to making it a home, Wynonna. Oooh! Do I get a badge? (gasping): A code name? Oh, my God, a flamethrower? You will be a Black Badge consultant. And remember our deal: you move in here with me. Long as I get to pick the new color scheme. Oh. OK. I'm thinking lots of pink. Just try it, kid. Oh, come on, we could make it nice. Look, we're already getting a shiny new mailbox. For some reason. (Waverly giggling) Yeah, Henry wanted to replace it, seeing as it had been "defiled by hooligans." It's such a shame all the men in this town are insane. Well, he can't be a revenant. Hmm. Not with the ammolite working again, right? So not the enemy. Not quite a friend... Not a bad sight in Champ's jeans, right? Just saying. That sneaky son of a bitch! Yeah, well, most of my stolen stuff was returned, OK? And he's just one of those crazy Wyatt fans. Wynonna : Hmm... Waverly : No, he's definitely one of the good guys. Everything in my body tells me he's one of the bad boys. My entire body. Don't you think he's a little old for you? Careful now, I can still demote you to Black Badge mascot. (Wynonna chuckles) I've been blaming you for what happened to Daddy... to Willa. I was the one who planted the talisman. It's my fault. Bobo tricked you. Still... And when I find your not-so-imaginary friend, oh, honey, I'm gonna make him pay. Just be careful, OK? (chuckling): Yeah. Careful's not really my style. Besides how scared can you be of a guy named Bobo? ♪♪♪ I hear tell the heir lit up your Shadow. Seems she is more than we bargained for. Apparently, you are too. So then I've earned your loyalty? It's a moving target. Now Levi, on the other hand, he promised to bring me Wynonna's head. But instead, he gave her some very sensitive information. Now did you, Levi? He got a lot to say about you too. Still, you've proven to be on our side, and now I want to show you what happens to the ones who aren't. What are you gonna do with him? I'm not gonna do anything... but you... you're gonna drag him over to that wheel and chain him up, across the line. What line? The line that keeps us here. You see, when you drag a revenant across the line, it gets, uh... ugly. If you wanna be in... ♪♪♪ (Levi hyperventilating) I am sorry, Levi, but it's you or me. Please! Please! Please don't do this! Forget what I said. You're a good man! You got a... You got a code! You don't wanna do this! No! You have no idea what I want. (Levi howling with pain) First, Malcolm went rogue, then Red, and now Levi. All who fled our flock in a futile attempt to master a gun that, as of now, has only a mistress. Let no other revenant turn away from my guidance... on punishment of banishment and living hell on this Earth. (Levi screaming) I swear to you, our salvation lies not in thieving Peacemaker, or defeating the heir, but in the dig! (revenants agreeing) Yeah. We stick to the plan! We stay on course. We let the Seven deal with the heir while the rest of us work, as we've been working for 15 years, towards one common goal: freedom! (revenants cheering) (screaming) I'm a man of my word, Henry. I can give her to you. The woman that changed you. (Levi screaming) Well then, Bobo, we are officially in business. ♪♪♪ (Levi screaming) Help!
