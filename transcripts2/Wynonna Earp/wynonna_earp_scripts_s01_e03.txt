 Previously on Wynonna Earp. 
 You are now consultant deputy  for the Black Badge Division. 
 Regular guns can slow the revheads down. Only Peacemaker puts them down for good. You want to escape the Triangle and feast on everything? Boss, it's all I want. I'm Nicole. Nicole Haught. I'm in a relationship with a boy. Man! A boy-man is the worst. It's just a matter of time before they figure out  who I really am. You got a problem with that? The only one about to have a problem... Bad move, revenant! Is Wynonna. ♪ Hell, I've ♪ Last one, Shorty. ♪ I got nothing left to give ♪ I'll take that. With that ticker? The hell you will. I ain't keeling over any time soon. Nice to see you girls moving in together. It's too bad she's got so much stuff. Well if you weren't so short-staffed, maybe Waverly could carry her own crap! Love you, sis! ♪ You keep my mind awake ♪ Buy me a round, Henry? Oh, you are awful forward for a girl in dungarees. Seems like it's the least you can do. Met guys like you before. Maybe not the OK-Corral shtick, but charming loners who would drink too much. Oh, don't forget, can't find honest work. ♪ Don't make this mess for me ♪ Mm. They're always either running from or looking for something. Seems like you're just my type. ♪ Don't make this mess for me ♪ What makes you think that you are mine? ♪ For me ♪ There's something about him, you know, in the eyes. OK. You know what? We can't all settle down with our high-school sweethearts. Hmm, still. I've met worse guys than Henry. Oh, I'm sorry, "met"? OK, when you're done judging me, make sure you're ready to drop your research on Dolls tomorrow. Oh, I'm ready. And believe me, you are gonna dig it. Over a hundred years ago, the wife of one of our founding fathers buried a time capsule. And though she could neither hear nor speak, Shirley Dixon's words live on in the poetry she left behind. 15 years you've been gone; you sure it's in there? As sure as I'm resurrected and standing here. I buried it here myself in 1906. With a new library coming to this site, it's time to unearth the past. Alright. Let's find out what she left us. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! You can't get... No! No, you can't! Oh, my God! Call the police! Haha! Here it is. Dixon's diary. "Voice of a mute." Well done. (people gasping and screaming) Sammy, I'm getting an itch here. Can I just do one? Please, Sam? That is a valuable piece of local history! Someone, call the police! This one has to hold you, Marty. Make it quick. (Marty growling) No! I-I... Oh! (people screaming) Oh! What are you? Why... Why are you doing this? Just leave this place! Trust me... we're trying. (stab) Argh! (people screaming) (multiple stabbing) (Marty grunting and laughing) Oh! ♪ ♪ 
♪ 'Cause I gave you all I've got to give ♪ 
♪ And no, that ain't no way to live ♪ 
♪ I told that devil ♪ 
♪ To take you back ♪ 
♪ I told that devil to take you back ♪ So, everything from the mountains to where the North and South Ghost rivers meet forms the Ghost River Triangle. OK? Yeah. It cuts through the big city, contains thousands of square miles of forest, foothills, prairie, uh, the Badlands. And all of it... cursed. Yeah, the Earp Curse. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. It's just, um... It's been a long time since I said it out loud. You know, sounds a little cuckoo bananas. Hell, this isn't my first time hearing about demonic maledictions or enclaves of evil. Proceed. Yes, Waverly, "proceed." Um, ahem... So the Triangle seems to act as some sort of prison, right? Any revenants who try to cross the boundaries... Wait-wait! I know this one. Daddy said, "Peeps who try to cross the boundary suffer hell on earth." They're not people. They used to be. OK, so these outlaws-turned-demons, can you ID them? Um, yeah, well... I... I-I had some names in this ledger, right, which, uh... which was... Anyway. Um, I can still make out a few of them from old photos, and I have a really, really good hunch about some others. OK, well, my superiors frown upon hunches. So if this Triangle is a prison, then we're the wardens. I mean, we gotta identify the prisoners and keep them contained. By shooting them in the face. Starting with the seven revenants that attacked our homestead and killed our sister. I want them to tremble with fear before me. You got powdered sugar on your nose. These will be great resources. Sorry. Uh, I spent years on that research so... Welcome to Team Shut-Up-and-Do What-He-Says. Sometimes, we get donuts. (knocking on door) Ooh. Enter. Hey. You asked to be alerted whenever things come over the wire that seem... unusual? Yeah, we're coming. Thanks. Waverly, you're dismissed. So, that's it? He's not really the Let's-go-for-drinks-and-celebrate type. You did great! Yep! (sigh) Sure. Oh! Ha! Get back here, Doc Holliday. Ohhhh... sh1t! No... ♪ Oh, he was a man ♪ 
♪ He said he was a good man ♪ Who is it? Bobo sent me. Inside now. ♪ He was out of his mind ♪ 
♪ But deep down inside ♪ I question what sort of a man sends an angel to do his bidding. I don't know no Angel. Name's Bethany. Bethany. Lovely, darling. Now, am I to assume that you have the vital information that Bobo knows that I so sorely desire? Bobo's got another job for you. Well, he has not paid me for the last one, so I decline. With prejudice. Bobo tells us to do things, and we do 'em. That's the deal around here. Not for me. ♪ The ones he would find were the Devil's lines ♪ I hear you're brave. Good with a gun. I hear you're also famous for... Bravery... is just a fancy word for stupid. Please refrain from accusing me of such foolishness. (song still playing with indistinct lyrics) Now, as for my prowess with a gun... you tell Bobo to drag his corrupt corpse down to my trailer and tell me what I wanna know, or he will gain some first-hand knowledge of the efficacy of my shot. If what I hear is true, it's been a hell of a long time since you taught anyone a lesson. Unless you don't wanna. Well now, ma'am, I... I did not say that. And this will really piss Bobo off. The cherry on my sundae. What makes this ours? The deputy mayor's body was fileted. Like a fish. Ah, fish death equals Black Badge, got it. They also took Shirley Dixon's journal. Theories? You mean, like a hunch? Well, the diary of our country's most beloved deaf-mute poet could bring in some serious coin. Why kill the deputy mayor in front of dozens of witnesses? They must've really wanted it. Along with his severed hand. Say what? This came in a few days ago. Oh, viewer discretion is advised. I think I can handle it. OK... Can't say I didn't warn you. Oh, my God! (old man screaming) (flesh tearing sounds) How dull is that knife? Oh, he's gonna miss his bus. Hahahahaha! Play it again. Hahahahaha! See how he moves? Freaky. Could be mimicking a hellhound. Strong, fast, finely tuned sense of smell... (gunshot) Girly, you killed your own daddy. Did our work for us! (crazy laughing) Earp. He's one of the Seven. He was there that night. What did they want with a book and an old dude's paw? All these items are carefully curated. My theory is that they're collecting rarities for a ritual. What, like Voodoo? Uh, more like Dark-Ages European than Haitian. Sometimes, you come so close to cool, and then cool makes a run for it. The victim was Mel Cleghorn. 50 years ago, he was charged with the killing of his girlfriend. All evidence pointed to his guilt, but he was let off. And legend has it the left hand of an innocent murderer can open gateways. They're trying to get out of the Ghost River Triangle. They can't. It's impossible. I hope so. OK, a mute's voice, an innocent killer; what's next? Now, these things  usually come in threes, mundus triformis. Uh? It's a kind of paradox, like cold fire, the living dead. Ohhh, OK. Yeah. I'll keep my eyes open for a zombie wearing an icy-hot patch. Come on, Earp, this ain't no joke. If the revenants escape, they can scatter to the four corners of the world, ignite a sh1t storm of rape, murder, pillaging. Well, the pillaging, we could handle. OK, where are you going? We've got work to do. Earp! Earp! We've got a description of the van. Yeah. I need to think. And tequila. Mucho tequila. Sir! what are you doing?! Sir! (Marty growling) No! NO! (Marty laughing) (man screaming) Oh, so that's why you're here? You're running a book? On frontier life. But I am lately stumped. I seek the name and likeness of a figure once prominent in these parts. Well, I have collected  almost every back issue of the Ghost River Chronicle. A bit of a local history nut myself. So, this guy that you're looking for... It's a woman. OK... Um... Ooh! Here we go! Look familiar? "Big Nose Kate." Long-time companion of a famous gunslinger... Not the filly I'm looking for. Think blonde. Think striking. Men always do. Why don't you look up the "Last spike" ceremony. I may recall her being there... so I've read. Of course. OK... "May, 1882." No. No photos. Recognize any names? Well, I appreciate the help, but I best be heading off. Oh. (musical ringtone playing) Oh. Uhhh... So... if I do find anything, uh, where are you staying? A place young ladies should not venture. A trailer park, proprietered by one Bobo Del Rey. (indistinct chatter) O... Oh. Much obliged, ma'am. OK. (door closing) (birds singing) Hey, Daddy. Hi, Willa. Sorry, I don't visit much, but you're not even in there. Nothing but sand in your casket. (sighs) This is your gig. You should be doing this. You were meant to. I miss you guys so damn much. (shoveling sounds) Man : The numbers. I need those numbers. Little respect here? Trying to have a moment with my family! He'll tell me the numbers! (shoveling sounds) Whoa! Pretty sure this is illegal. Sam wants the numbers. Stan knows them. Just gotta ask him. Hmm, doubt you're gonna get much out of Johnny McDead here. You OK, pal? Off your meds? Three of them made me what I am! BANG! Where I am? Hell? Must be Hell. But I come back! (growling) You. Never going back. Oh, you're going back, revenant. And you're gonna burn. (panting) Christ, he is fast! (sighing) I ran the name on the headstone. Stanley Gatewood. Hello to you too, Dolls. Managed the Bank of Purgatory in the 70s. Hired a man by the name of Marty who took great pleasure in foreclosing on farmers. Why didn't you shoot him? He moves like he's krumping, remember? But he dropped this... You're welcome. (Dolls sighs) Passwords? Bank accounts? Combination? But the Bank of Purgatory is now a surplus store. Contractors build around old vaults that are too big to move. Down that coffee and we'll go. It's really hot. Fine! Hmm! ♪ ♪ There, the van. We're too late. OK, we're gonna take cover and regroup. We don't want to tip them off. Good thing we're not driving a giant narcmobile. Yeah, it's just a two-inch clamp for my tow hook. Think it'll be expensive? Less than the ring you owe Waverly. Oh, sorry. (Marty growling) Look at that body. I call dibs! Thanks. I get that a lot. sh1t! Everybody on the ground! Plan B, boys, we got company! Ah! Stay back! We got hostages! Go! Hostages. Good, right? Means they're not going to kill them. Not yet. Everybody hand over your phones. Now. Who still carries phones, right? Don't make me damage what will soon be mine! Don't do this, fellas. You haven't hurt anybody yet. Just take what's in the register, leave out the back. (revenants laughing) Ugh! Ah! (Shorty moaning) Keep your head! That bitch outside can send us all back to Hell, and these hostages are our only bargaining chips! You and you, head to the back! You behind the desk, follow 'em. Get him off the floor! Now! (Shorty moaning) We're close, boys! Marty, move your ass, find the vault. Gary, you help him. Alone? Why are we not going in there and shooting these bastards? Do the odds. You think we can subdue all three before they kill anyone? (siren call) Oh, the cavalry. Just in time. (Wynonna) Ah, great. Got a report of shots fired, hostage situation. I call the Tac team? It'll take them an hour to get here from the city. You take your cues from me. So we just stand around with our thumbs up our asses? And if that's how you've been trained, feel free. Hostage taking is about bargaining, right? We have things they want. The combination? And the Earp heir. No. Too risky. They'll kill you. You said it yourself, they're trying to piece together some kind of spell, so if they think I can help them get what they want, then that's gotta be worth every person in there. Give this to whoever's in charge. And... Never get into a vehicle, never move to a second location. You've been in a hostage situation before? Sort of. This time, you're the law, and innocent people are depending on you. Now, your gun. What?! They're not gonna let you in there with it. I'll get it back to you, Earp. I promise. Ok. Here goes. (door unlocking) You know who I am, right? Oh, yeah. Take me in exchange for the hostages, and I'll help you get what you need. Come on! You need to talk to my boss. (cell phone ringing) See your hands. Tell me what you want. I'll release some hostages, but if you try anything, people will die. The Black Badge Division has facilities outside the Ghost River Triangle,  and if you harm one hair on my deputy's head, I guarantee you a fate much worse than death. Come on! (Beep!) What happened? Shorty's hurt. Just my angina acting up. You go into a surplus store, you're bound to come across a few tools. The women and the clerk can go. Hey! Hey! I said it's me in exchange for all the hostages. Yeah, well, we need three of you, so... For what? Come on. Oh, you're welcome! No problem. Hey, tchk! Pfff! 
 
 (indistinct police radio) When they come back, we need to create a diversion. How do you feel about flashing the twins? (growling, multiple stabbing) (Gary) No, Marty! Please! No! What's the plan, Deputy Marshal? We surround the store. You get a clear shot, let me know. OK. We hear shots, we go in. Call Waverly. Tell her that her sister's in a situation. OK. Isn't that Champ's truck? Waverly's boyfriend? Unfortunately... Consider my plot vacated. (key clinking) (motorcycle roaring) It was never yours, hombre. Now, you weren't stupid enough to let yourself be followed, were you? Never. Now listen here, Bobo Del Rey. I found Killer Miller, I dragged Levi across the line. But just so I don't feel like I owe you anything else, I think it's best I put some distance between us. Where are you gonna go? Anywhere under the stars. See, unlike your type, I can roam far and wide. Although from what I hear around your little enclave, some of your cronies, oh, they're itching to wander too. Well, they can try, but the only way out of the Triangle is with me. Henry... I know you've been looking for her... been coming up a little... empty. Why, I don't know who you're... No, you don't know who. Stone Witch? There it is. Your instincts are correct. She is close. And yes, she has been giving some of my... weaker brethren some ideas of escape. But I have her name. You give it to me. Just hold on now. The word is... Wynonna Earp's taken a shine to you. (crow cawing) We can use that. You son of a bitch, I do not work for you. You get the heir... to trust you. Have her think that, uh, you're on her side. (Bobo sniffing) Hell, once you get close to Wynonna, you'll be getting plenty on the side. Then, and only then... you'll get the name. But first... (musical ringtone playing) God, not now! Deal with that... or I will. You stupid girl. (gunshot) Ow! Ow! Wrist burn! You want your friends to live, you're gonna do something for us. What the hell?! (Marty roaring) Easy, Marty. The witch chose us three for a reason. Each of us guarding a different piece of the puzzle! I knew about the hand, Gary hid the stupid book; now I need you to get your piece! We didn't trust each other and now look what I done! Put down the knife! The heir's gonna help us! I do know the numbers. 'Least, I did! You got your ass put down by an Earp too, Gary! Sam and I waited 15 years for you to come back so you could find the damn diary. So be quiet! This seems to be going well. Shut up! You can kill us, right? Can you fix us? Bring Gary back. That's not how the curse works. I didn't put him down with the Peacemaker. He'll resurrect again soon. When? We don't have time for... If you're not gonna help us, I'm gonna... Wait! Wait! Krumper here dropped this when I chased him through the cemetery. Not quite a combination, but there are repeated sequences. So you're saying you can open it? Wouldn't be the first time I got all up in a 24-bolt Diebold. Marty! (growling) Put a muzzle on it. (clicking) (door closing) Oh, hey, Henry. The hell were you doing tailing me? I... What are you doing with Bobo Del Rey? None of your business! You don't know what he did to my family? You don't know what he is? Little girl, you do not know what I am. I know what you're supposed to be. You're supposed to be a hero. You're supposed to be Wyatt Earp's best friend! You're supposed to be here to help us! (loud slap) Wavrrly Earp, you pull your head out of the past. You let it die, you change your name. You do whatever it takes to get through that vapid brainpan of yours. Because if anybody is gonna clear the Earp name and pull this place out of misery... it sure as hell ain't gonna be the heir's pitiful, little sister! (objects shattering) You forgot stupid... for thinking you're anything more than just another a-hole. ♪ ♪ Ah! (sighing) There. One more. I could guess the first two, but the last one, not so much. So you can't open it?! I'll kill her! Guys! I'm doing this the old-fashioned way which requires silence. Looking at you, half-deck. (clicking) Survey says... (grunting with effort) A little help, morons? (Marty grunting) (Marty laughing crazily) (Marty grunting) It's here, Sam! Stan's two-timing wife's locket. I did it! You're welcome. The loveless heart. Now, we leave. You're hooped, bro. Place is surrounded. Oh, we'll get through. Then we're gonna leave the Ghost River Triangle forever. And you're coming with us. You have a shot. Jesus, Dolls, I've got a human shield. OK, I can offer safe passage in return for the hostages. Here's our safe passage! Anyone with a badge follows us, they all die! Deputy, did they find what they were looking for? Yeah. Loveless heart. But don't sweat it, I'm gonna kill these sons of bitches with my bare hands. Can I at least shoot out the goddamned tires? Yeah, if you want them to die now, go ahead. Tell Crazy Eyes not to hurt them. Not so tough without Wyatt's gun, eh? "With bare hands," that's cute. (engine revving up) We're just letting them go? No. ♪ ♪ You two, clear the scene. Ah! Let's go! You really think you solved the riddle, a way to break out? When my daddy wanted to scare us, he'd describe the brutal things that happen to revenants if they try to escape the Triangle. Ow! Bet he didn't do it justice, which is why we went to all this trouble. The vessel. Right where she said it'd be. Woman of her word. Who? Your girlfriend? Not with that beard. Your mom. Definitely a mama's boy, right? I tried to be patient, like Bobo said, but if the heir puts us down, where are we? Back in Hell again. You know Marty here's been put down three times? Third-generation revenant? Three times down south, you'd go a little psychotic too. So if we owe the Stone Witch big time in exchange for safe passage across the boundary, I can live with that. Stone Witch? ♪ ♪ They're gonna sacrifice us. They're gonna eat us. We won't let that happen. I just need to get my gun back. Come on, Dolls. (Shorty moaning) Oh no! Shorty! They got me, Wynonna. You do not give up, do you hear me? Your uncle Curtis was right. Always talking about the monsters among us when he'd had a few. There's always been something unnatural about this place. Still, I'll miss it. Don't try anything! If I do, it'll be the last thing you ever see. Sit! ♪ ♪ Can I finish him up? I told you, no! You need him! No way! I called dibs on the big roughrider! You have the... (two gunshots) (Marty groaning) Ugh, saved my last bullet for him. Been waiting to do that for a long time. (Wynonna) So have I. The old man's not gonna make it. Cowboy's the only good one left. That's why you need Champ's body? For some sort of, like, possession? What? In my body?! Wynonna, I don't even put gluten in this! Then you can walk across the line in human form. When I'm finally free of this place... you know what I'm gonna do to the first perfect family I come across? Hm? It involves power tools, pain... and days of pleading. But it'll be nothing compared to what I'll do to the second or the third... I got it. Then you stay put or I'll kill you next. Let every bond be loosened, every force fail. Let all walls crumble. Take me. Leave the others. Think about it. You can walk out of here, break the curse, get your freedom in the Earp heir. Wouldn't that be payback? For I am a servant of stone. Take me! Every bond be weakened, every force fail. I don't think I can save us all. Run. Now. Just me or...? For Waverly. Go! You go too. Shorty, if these monsters escape, I'm the only one who can stop them. I always told Gus and your sister you'd come back. Go on, Champ. I'll get help, I swear. OK. OK. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! The Stone Witch kept her word! Where's the young one? Where's...? (weird growling) OK, I got this. Fight him once he's inside me. This is not the kind of penetration I'm used to. Shorty, if this thing gets inside of me, tell Dolls to shoot me. Fast. They're wrong. You're a good girl, Wynonna. No! Ah! Ugh! Shorty? Hey! What the hell?! I'm in the dying one?! What's the point of possession if I... Gah! Damn that witch! Sam? That's you in there, right? You know you're gonna die even if you make it across the line. Witch got me in one body, maybe she'll find me another. What makes you think she won't kill you? It's worth the risk. Give me straight up death over being sent to Hell and back over and over. And she's my ride. She told me to get backup. Where's everybody else? I-I-I should go back. I'm all the backup she needs. Now run! Ok, Ok. Hey! Stop! I tried not to kill you. I thought it was crueller to make you watch me escape. But if you insist... Shorty... Shorty, if you're in there, don't let him do this. Shorty ain't here, bitch. (grunting) (click) Grrr! Ugh! Tell me that was your plan all along. (gunshot) (moaning) (gunshot) He's not there. The revenant's in your friend. Look, there's no other way. Bullshit. We can still save him, reverse the spell. Come on, Wynonna. There has to be a way. Robert "Shorty" Simons, you halt your ass right there. Wynonna? Shorty, fight it! Fight it! It hurts, it burns. Do it, please. I can hear his thoughts, everything he did. Shut up, old man! You have to stop him, Wynonna. He's a monster. We're the monster now, Shorty. They didn't kill your sister, not at first. He says Willa screamed for days! (Sam screaming) (sob) (Wynonna sobbing) Waverly. I'm so sorry. ♪ Inside of me ♪ I can't believe he's gone. ♪ When I lay down ♪ Oh, it's ok. Hey, um... OK. Hey, uh, I got your voicemail. Yeah. About Wynonna. Thanks. (softly) Thank you. That was really sweet. Yeah, sure. Of course. ♪ Whispers, whispers all the time ♪ I don't know, something about her rubs me the wrong way. Miss Officer what's-her-name. It's Haught. Ah... She's... She... Oh, baby, baby, baby, it's OK. Don't cry. Don't cry, it's ok. I'm ok. (Waverly sniffling) Right? Wynonna and I were almost human sacrificed. Shorty saved us. (softly) Yeah... Yeah. (whispering) It's ok. Yeah, uh... Dolls says that, uh, they were, uh, brainwashed by some kind of cult. Yeah. And Wynonna tells me you were really brave. I was. One thing's for sure: I'm never leaving your side again. OK? Oh, come on. ♪ You see nothing clearly ♪ Hey, uh, any update on that time capsule murder? Nedley knows I won't tell him, huh? It's unresolved. We're handing the case back over to metro. Any connection to the kidnapping? None. Poor Shorty. Yeah. We have his body, we're doing a full autopsy, but our best guess is the stress of the ordeal was too much for his heart condition. Nicole : She said she was glad I called. I'll bet. ♪ ♪ You know, maybe I could have helped. You know, like, really helped. Out there with you guys as a team. That's not our deal, Wav. Some team... Not even sure we're the good guys. Well, good guys seem to be in short supply these days. Believe me... you are definitely one of them. (Dolls sighs) It's tough, but it'll pass. Great pep talk. Shorty's dead, Revenants can body snatch people, and we don't know how to ID them. Not to mention, there's a witch out there toying with Revenants via high-risk spells. At least it didn't work. Doesn't mean they won't try it again though, right? Found the tracker you stuck behind my ear. The hell took you so long? I was always there. But I just needed to see if they could actually do it. Even if it meant Shorty had to die? Collateral damage. Ha! This is a war. You want to avenge your sister and your dad, right? And this is what victories might have to look like. And what about our failures? Wynonna... Wow... Yeah. With all the sh1t I've done in my life... Dolls, working with you... I don't think I can look in the mirror. ♪ ♪ Oh, please, make yourself at home. I did not know the man well, but no barkeep has ever made a better Mule Skinner. Shorty was my friend. About the only friend I had around here. Well, I could be a friend and, who knows, maybe in time, maybe a trusted confidante... Listen, "Hank". I've had a supremely shitty day. There was an old saying, "Quiet ponies never made for skilled riders." (sighing) I frigging hate horses. You have seen a lot of strange things in Purgatory, unnatural things, so I do hope your mind is open. Look, if you're about to propose a threesome, I'm tired and I haven't shaved my legs. No. Henry? The fact is, I have not properly introduced myself. You can tell your sister she is right. I am... was... friends with your great-great-grandpappy. My name is John Henry, but most people just called me Doc. "Doc"? Doc Holliday? ♪ How am I supposed to die ♪ Wynonna Earp... ♪ How am I supposed to die ♪ I am at your disposal. Well, sh1t.
