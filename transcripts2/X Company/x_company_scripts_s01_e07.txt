 (grunting with effort) 
 (groaning) 
 woman : Let me go! 
 Let my people go. 
 man : We've heard a rumour about your friends from the Cafe de I'Azur. 
 Aurora : Forget my name. 
 S01E07 
Quislings 
 (people chattering) 
 One o'clock, on the bench, newspaper. 
 No handkerchief. 
 And he should have a suitcase. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 He should be here by now. 
 Is that him? With the suitcase? 
 It's the wrong wardrobe. 
 What happened? 
 (laboured breathing) 
 Did he get the book? 
 Did he? 
 Shhh. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's OK. 
 (laboured breathing) 
 What's the key? 
 Fall to thy... 
 What? 
 Fall to thy prayers. 
 (crunch) 
 Cyanide... drilled into his tooth. He took the book. 
 They knew where we were meeting, what he'd be carrying. 
 They're closing in on us. 
 The courier? 
 But he gave us the key: 
 "Fall to thy prayers". 
 Fall to thy prayers... 
 "How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!" 
 Act V... scene V. Henry rejects Falstaff. 
 A microdot, in the 'i' of "ill." 
 (police siren) 
 For you. 
 Harry : Finally. 
 Could you run the antenna for me? 
 Look at you! 
 It's the latest model. State of the art. The tapper's improved. It's 10% lighter too. 
 It came at a pretty high price. 
 The courier didn't make it. 
 Here's what I got from the microdot. 
 Let's have a look. 
 Thirty targets at zero hour. 
 I've only received background on six of them. Why? 
 We decide what you need to know. 
 I've been read in. I have a higher clearance than my prime minister. How can I do my job if I'm not being kept informed? 
 Look, I'm sorry, Duncan. But there's that delicate matter of trust. 
 You'll have everyone by 1400 hours, Paris time? 
 They'll be there. 
 Good. 
 All teams report they've received their orders. 
 They're in position? 
 They are. 
 But we have a casualty. 
 Charlie, the courier. 
 Krystina? 
 The file Colonel Mayhew wanted. 
 I'll see he gets it. 
 He showed promise then he never got out of the gate. 
 We lost five last week, two of them women. 
 God willing, today will turn the tide. 
 I'll notify his family. 
 You get used to it. 
 I'd rather not. 
 Sir... 
 I thought maybe you could pass this along. 
 It's for the Colonel's eyes only. 
 Thank you, Krystina. 
 Harry : All across the city, executions. 
 The targets are civilians... every one of them. 
 Civilians? 
 Aurora : Operation Rat Catcher. 
 Zero hour is 1400. 
 I guess we know what these are for, then. 
 Welrods. Silenced, and they don't trace back to any manufacturer; makes it harder to know where they came from. 
 Germans don't know where to direct reprisals. 
 We all strike at once, so they don't know how many of us are out there. 
 Or how many of them are targeted. 
 So it's a morale operation too. 
 Get it done, melt away. 
 That should send a message. How many targets do we have? 
 Three. 
 I'll take this one. Neil. This one's yours; deals drugs and information. 
 Looks like a charmer. 
 He's considered violent and unstable. 
 Tom? Informant, black marketeer. 
 Tom? 
 Is this gonna be a problem? 
 What are you doing with that file? 
 How were these targets chosen? 
 Resistance cells passed on the name to Operations. 
 Operations culled the list and approved the targets. 
 I'd like that back, please. 
 Did you bother to match the intel with the source? 
 What, personally? No. We have people for that. 
 Some of these names are from a single complaint. 
 How do we know it's not neighbours settling scores? 
 Personal grudges? 
 Well, again, Sinclair, it's about trust. I trust my sources; they trust me. 
 Which is critical, because in our line of work we don't often have the luxury of certainty. 
 What are you really saying? 
 We don't see eye to eye. 
 We share the same objective. 
 Your mission is to supply resistance; you blow up a bridge. 
 You're supposed to bring in a physicist; you end up assassinating a very senior Gestapo. 
 We take initiative! 
 We make complex choices! 
 And let's not mention losing the Vichy mayor, who would have proven to be a very valuable double agent, had you not let the enemy get there first. 
 You know how it works! 
 You act without clearance. 
 You behave like a cowboy. 
 Which is fine in America. 
 And perhaps that'll be your next posting. 
 Don't think, don't hesitate. The more automatic it is, the easier it'll be. You want to have a good little cry, do it after. 
 These aren't Frenchmen, they're traitors. They may as well be wearing a swastika. 
 A market vendor? 
 And your guy, a baker? 
 There's a threat. He was 16 at Ypres. He's a hero of the Republic... 
 Then he should have known better than to sell out. 
 How do we know that he even... 
 That's not our problem, Tom. 
 We're not the jury today. We're the sentence. 
 Look, I get the message. Just... don't ask me to like the tactics. 
 When was the last time you did it, Tom? 
 Took a life in the line of duty? When did you actually follow through? 
 Took a life? Follow through? 
 There's a simpler word for it, Neil. And yeah, I'd rather not  kill if I had the choice. 
 What did you think we were gonna do here? 
 Aurora : Come on, Neil. 
 You know the Chinese think courage lives down in the gall bladder. 
 How 'bout I crack you open? I bet we don't find any gallstones. 
 I bet we don't find any stones at all. 
 Oh, you mean like the kind of stones that it takes to kill a kid tied to a pipe in a basement. 
 Those kind of stones? 
 Say that again. 
 You heard me. 
 Guys. 
 Drop it, guys! 
 Did you not hear me? 
 Say that again, Tom. 
 We could take this outside. 
 Neil, enough! 
 What do you say? 
 Stop it! Stop it right now! 
 It's hard enough already without this. 
 (deep breath) 
 They want me to stay here. 
 I'll pick up relays on the other agents and report back to Sinclair and Mayhew. 
 Harry, all this radio traffic... 
 Germans will be out there tracking signals. They already knew about our courier and once the bodies start falling... 
 I'll be fine. 
 I don't wanna leave you on your own. 
 So who's gonna stay? 
 Come on, you can't leave Alfred here. 
 The heat will be on me more than you. 
 What I mean is... he's not supposed to be taken alive. 
 Yeah, and Alfred is safer - everything he knows - we're all safer if he's with you. 
 I'll be fine, don't worry. I promise you. 
 I'll keep moving. The Fat Men will never find me. 
 My gall bladder, it's like... this. (chuckling) 
 All right. 
 That was way out of line! 
 Shhh. 
 Listen to me. We decided as a team that we couldn't risk taking that German with us. 
 That he couldn't be trusted. 
 That's not the point! 
 And Neil is the one who carries the weight of that! 
 He gets blood on his hands so we don't have to. 
 Look, Sinclair and I worked it out. 
 I kept you out of the messy stuff as long as I could. 
 But today... we can't protect you. 
 Don't think, don't blink, get it done, and walk away. 
 Then I'll see you at the catacombs. 
 (knock) 
 That burnt-out jewellery store back there... 
 The owner, Monsieur Fleischmann, he used to sweep the streets nine times a day. 
 You could eat off that street. 
 Besnell's bookshop is gone... no one looks you in the eye... I don't... I don't know this place anymore. 
 (groaning) 
 (beeping in Morse code) 
 Ich werde nach rechts gehen. 
 Ich glaube, das Signal kommt von der Seite. 
 It's north of here, just across the bridge. 
 woman : Hello, Simone. 
 Simone : How are you? How is your family? 
 woman : They are well, thank you. 
 Ooh, that is very good. 
 Oh, hello! 
 It's good to see you. 
 So nice to see you. 
 They sent me a new wig, yes! 
 Samuel. 
 Hello. 
 For your mother. 
 Samuel : Thank you. 
 Now you say hello for me, all right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hello, monsieur. 
 Hello, Simone. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (woman chuckling) 
 (beeping in Morse code) 
 (beeping in Morse code) 
 (beeping in Morse code) 
 (beeping in Morse code) 
 (louder beeping) 
 Niemand da. 
 (beeping in Morse code) 
 (panting) 
 man : Hello, Simone. 
 It's all here. 
 Thank you. Be careful. 
 Thank you, Simone. 
 (breathing in) 
 (breathing out) 
 This is it. 
 Hasn't been closed long. 
 You knew this man. 
 You and Rene... and your friends. 
 You used to meet here. Is that why you picked this target? 
 Unfinished business? 
 I knew him but that's not the reason. 
 I'm learning to hear it now. 
 What? 
 When you're not telling the truth. 
 His apartment's upstairs. 
 His name is Michel? 
 Yes. 
 (footsteps) 
 (breathing in) (gun cocking) 
 (breathing out) 
 Yes? 
 Cecile? 
 Aurora! 
 You remembered! 
 Well, it's been so long. 
 Um, Cecile, meet my friend Mathieu. 
 I've been telling him about Michel's profiteroles for months now. I was hoping your brother would be at the cafe. But... 
 Yes, well, what a shame. 
 We try everything, kept it open for as long as we could, but... 
 Well, you can't live off dreams, can you? 
 No. 
 Well... 
 I'll be sure to tell Michel you came by. 
 When are you expecting him back? 
 Oh, it depends on whether he has any luck at the market. 
 Why don't you come back tomorrow? 
 You see, the thing is, um... Mathieu and I, we've been working with some... "close friends", people I trust. And we'd like to talk to Michel. I know he's always been so supportive of the cause. 
 Of course. I see. Well, why don't you come in? 
 Please, if you don't mind waiting, I know he'd love to see you. Please, please. 
 Why don't we sit down here at the cafe? 
 
 
 
 Simone : How are you feeling? Are you able to sleep? 
 I have something for your leg. Let's take a look. 
 (little groans) 
 man : I survived barbed wire, falling from the train... bullets... and now one little scrape... 
 I was careful with the Germans, but not so careful with the germs. 
 (chuckling) 
 This will hurt. 
 It's lucky they knew to come to me. 
 I know Resistance friends who can get you out. 
 I know which hands to shake and I know how valuable you are, what you have seen. 
 What you know. 
 Can you walk? 
 It may take a while for the medication to work. 
 Then I move. Fast. 
 Stay here. 
 I will come back soon with help. 
 I'll be ready. 
 Madame! 
 I thank God they called you. 
 I feel the same, Monsieur Drabek. 
 (fast breathing) 
 (sigh) 
 echoing voice : Neil, I'm glad it was you. 
 Who are you? 
 Why are you in my flat? 
 Didn't they tell you? 
 Place is full of leaks. From some b*st*rd. 
 Is that true? Have you been leaking to Jerry? 
 You made a mistake coming here. 
 You want it? 
 Get through me. 
 Is that it? Is that all you got? 
 (groaning) 
 It's exactly as I remember...  but quieter. 
 Mm. 
 When did he close it? 
 Two months ago. 
 He would have sugar, but no flour. Flour, but no sugar. 
 And eventually, no customers. 
 Germans... they take the best for themselves. 
 Still, he was... luckier than most. 
 Mm. 
 Michel will be so surprised to see you! 
 I remember you and all your friends. 
 All the noise you would make. All the wine and the singing... 
 Giselle and Jo-Jo. 
 Maxime, Pauline. 
 Gregoire. 
 I haven't seen them since they were taken in the raid. 
 (sigh) 
 Oh... how is that boy, the one you were always with? 
 Good looking... 
 Rene. 
 Such a nice young man. 
 Yes. 
 He was. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 No, no. It's fine. 
 How could you know? 
 Excuse me a moment? 
 Yes? 
 May I... 
 Oh, down the hall... and to the left. 
 He's very quiet, your friend. 
 Yes, he can be shy. 
 He's one of you, then. 
 There are more of us than ever. 
 So brave. 
 Who are you? 
 (yelling) 
 (groaning) 
 (bones breaking) 
 (panting) 
 (groaning) 
 (sobbing) 
 Whoa, slow down. 
 Whatever you think is happening here, it's not. 
 Gestapo? Russian? 
 You can't possibly think that I'm Russian. 
 Look, I'm here because of you. 
 Simone sent me. 
 Where is she? 
 She's with a child in Montreuil who's coughing his guts out. She's bringing him sulfa drugs. 
 You think that you're the only one who needs saving? 
 Drabek. You're a Pole? 
 I'm American. 
 Just let me go, I'll sing "Yankee Doodle Dandy". 
 What's the password? 
 She didn't give me one, and you know that, so can we please just... stop this. 
 (panting) 
 That's a hell of a grip you got there. 
 Where'd you pick that up? 
 Killing the people who stood in my way. 
 Is that how you got wounded? 
 Razor wire. 
 Look... 
 Simone said you needed help. 
 How'd you make contact with her? 
 Friends. 
 I don't say more. 
 This is a twoway street, pal. 
 I need to trust you as well. 
 They said Simone could be trusted. 
 And she knows how to get things from Paris. 
 What do you need? 
 Safe passage. To England or America. 
 Yeah, a lot of people are looking for that. 
 I know. 
 But I have seen things people need to hear. 
 Are you Catholic? 
 Presbyterian, on my mother's side. 
 My dad's side is drunkard, but reformed. 
 I'm sorry, but how is that relevant? 
 Catholics talk a lot about Hell... it being a place somewhere down below. 
 But it's not. 
 It's here. 
 I've been there. 
 And there is no reason now I should be alive if I do not tell your leaders what I saw. 
 Cecile : It's so hard, you know... to keep your spirits up. 
 Aurora : I see. 
 Michel and I... we try to stay optimistic. 
 And how is that? 
 I keep saying to him: 
 "Michel, at least we have each other." 
 Which isn't saying much, but at least I do know how to make him laugh. 
 chuckling) (Aurora : Yes. 
 If you don't remember how to laugh, then... what are we? 
 Would you like a little more? 
 No. 
 Please. 
 Here, have the rest of it. 
 Tom : Downstream from Villemarie, by the river. 
 They want us to confirm it's Rene. Alfred : He'd be swept away. There's a bend downriver. He'd have cover. Cecile : We have had to sell so many things. Silverware. Candlesticks. Your friend Gregoire's paintings. We've got nothing now. Michel is out selling table cloths so that we can look for bread in the market. Aurora : That's too bad... How can you imagine... Michel buying bread? (inaudible) And who knows what they put in it? (Cecile speaking) This kind of place, it was a British invention. From the war against the Boers. A place to throw away a people. Americans used them for Indians. I have the bad luck of being a history student. As with many things... the Germans made... "industrial improvements". They call it a "concentration camp". Your brother is an honest man? Of course. He wouldn't keep it a secret from you if he had money? What? If he made a living as an informant. What?! No! Well... I don't actually know what he does when he's not here, but... door opening) (Michel : Cecil! I'm so sorry! Nothing at the market, Cecile. Please! I begged him not to do it but he wouldn't listen! I always liked you all! Oh, please! Just... Shhh. Cecile? Aurora. What are you doing here... What am I doing still alive? screaming : Nooo! On your knees. Now! Your sister was just telling us you have a secret source of income. She's lying. You're making a mistake... You sold out 19 people who trusted you! Don't do this. You know me. The money's hers! It wasn't me! (screaming) Kneel! (sobbing) You think you're the only one who has it hard? The only one who's lost something? (weeping) Now tell everyone that this... this is what you get. And don't even think of going to the Germans or you'll see me again. Or someone just like me, 'cause we're everywhere. Remember my words. Forget my name. (sobbing) (crying) (Aurora weeping softly) I'm fine. I'm fine. Just... just give me a minute. Why didn't you tell us you knew him? I had to see his face. After what he did. I'm glad you were with me. (deep sigh) This is not how I thought it would feel. How does it feel? Feel this. Yeah. This. Me too. Yeah? (breathing out) You never say my name. No. Why? It's... (engine roaring nearby) We should go. Harry : Right here. Nice place. Yeah, except no signal. I'll have to go back outside. How long you been down here? Not too long. Why? Did you see the trucks? Lots of them. They're moving something into place. Something's up besides our rat hunt. What do you think it is? I don't know. Jeez, what happened to your face? Complications. You know, when I was a kid, I was afraid of the dark. What do mean, "when you were a kid"? Unpack the rest of your stuff. Let's settle in. What you're saying, it can't be true. (speaking foreign language) Forgive me. We have to leave, right now. My friends and I can get you somewhere safe. Your friend... he's getting me out of Paris. He is? He's lucky that you were able to care for his leg. Supplies are hard to come by, especially... on short notice. You can get anything. You just have to be willing to pay. What's your currency? I'm sorry? This "anything", how do you pay for it? I work hard. I know what you're selling. What's going on here? This man is not who he says he is. I've never seen him before. You lied to me. Did you tell her about the German camps? Who are you? This woman... is a collaborator. She's sold you, for money, to the Gestapo. That's how she can afford supplies! And my guess is, they're the friends that she was talking about, and they're on their way here right now. Why are you doing this? I took him in. I gave him food. Medicine. She's a proven German collaborator. My friends said she could be trusted. And I trust my friends. She plays both sides. She plays the long game. That's how it works. I know every Resistance cell within five miles. He's not one of us. Think! How did he find you? I didn't find him. I found you. I followed you. I'm supposed to execute you. She said she was bringing help. Where is it? If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. She's here... because she's protecting her investment. She's a traitor. (tires screeching) And here's the proof.
