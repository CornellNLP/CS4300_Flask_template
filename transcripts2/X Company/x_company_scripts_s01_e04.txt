 (woman laughing) 
 (machine gun fire) Ugh! woman : Let me go! There are nights... when all I want is to forget. woman : Forget my name. You want me to pull them off an operation in progress. This comes from above us both. From heaven, as far as you're concerned. And one doesn't say no to heaven. Quite. Have your team find the package, deliver him to Nightingale, and we both sleep through the night. The Manhattan crowd will love that. Nightingale's their asset. Well, I'm sure you can smooth things over, Duncan. You speak fluent American. Goodbye. There's nothing we can do. He's pulling us off the bombings. When we're hitting our stride? Still got three targets to go: the post office, the armoury... You'll have to burn those plans too. We can't leave anything behind. What's the point of inflicting terror if we're going to take our foot off the gas? We're just the messengers. Here's what we know. A British bomber went down close to here. The recovered crew say that the aircraft dumped its bombs here, and crashed past this field. Germans will be all over it looking for any sign of survivors. Now, two of the crew followed training, made contact. Resistance is getting them out. But our bombardier went off here, south-south-west. I can lead the Germans off his trail. What've you got to drop? I could mock up some flight logs. We'll track down the bombardier. And Alfred and I will head to Toulouse, make an extraction plan with Nightingale and meet you there. Trains to Spain? They leave... twice a week. Next one's tomorrow, 11:15 a.m. Lot of trouble for a bombardier. What's the lucky boy's name? First Lieutenant Walter Simonson Pike. Thirsty? How's it going, "Alphonse"? Fine, thanks, "Arnelle." We're gonna need a term of endearment. How about Bijou? Bijou. Favourite food? Cherries with garlic and salt. Really. The cherries are no good on their own. They taste spiky. The garlic makes them smooth, F major seven. How about we stick to just cherries? Right. Where did we get married? Anglise Mare de Dieu, Iga, 1937, in Basse-Normandie, in the township of Bellame, part of the district... I wish I had your memory. No, you don't. I only have one party trick. What's that? Never mind. Tell me. (chirping like a bird) (laughing) That's great. Everyone has some secret talent. Rene used to say, "There's no greatness too small." I wish I'd met him. Yeah. Let's speed it up. Long way to go. I think we lost the trail. He's here. So, Walter Simonson-Pike, your surviving crew managed to get out on Resistance channels. Why'd you split off and go south? We'd been badly hit. Too far from anywhere to set down. We needed to drop our payload to stay aloft. I sighted empty fields. Dropped the bombs, but... at the last second, that farmhouse came up so fast. I needed to see what I'd done. To try to help. So you decided to run back towards the buildings you bombed? It seemed like the decent thing to do. Then I got lost. As a general rule, we like to stay away from anything burning and Germans. All right then, Your Lordship, get up. Let's get a look at you. Anyone see you running around in this uniform? No. All right, well, you keep the scruff, and we'll find something for you. Get out of this, though. Lot of fuss for you, mate. So, who do you know? My father. He's an assistant secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Fantastic. I'm Lord of the Shitpile. Do what we say, and we might not die. Get dressed. Don't worry; once you get to know him, he's... he's pretty much exactly the same. Let's go, gentlemen, let's go. There are lives in your hands here. There you are, sir. We're all set for the new Yankee recruits. Quartermaster managed to scare up sheets for six. Four. Two didn't make it past the psych test. And I'd like you to lead the "welcome detail." Of course. Sixty seconds! Aurora's team? Nothing yet. It's a disgrace. Pulling strings, exposing agents... just to get your son a personal escort out of France. What if it was your son? The one son I have left is in the Pacific... and he's been missing for a month. And no, I wouldn't pick up the phone. I would want to, yes, but I wouldn't. I'm sorry. You didn't know. Thirty seconds! Has this man taught you nothing, son? It's not like the ones we studied, sir! They rarely are! Fix it! Done, sir. Good, Laszlo, good! So at least someone knows what they're doing here. Done, sir. Good, Andy. Five! Four! Three! Two. You are out of time, Charlie. If that was wired to C4, there'd be nothing left of you to clean up right now. Again! I shouldn't vent. I'd vent. I have a brother out there too. Could we get a table near the back, please? Follow me. (sultry jazz song) ♪ Way down in Egypt land ♪

♪ Let my people go ♪ (cheers and applause) Thank you. Thank you. Marcus Chapman, ladies and gentlemen, a man with no fear of the avant-garde. We're going to take a short break. Y'all don't go anywhere. Gimlet with a cherry. Thank you for seeing us. I had word you were coming, but my next trip's not till the end of the month. What's going on? Mademoiselle DuVernay, I have all six of your records. Aw. Forgive my husband. He can be a little... starstruck. We, um... we need you to change your itinerary. We have friends on the way with a special package. Oh. This "package" ain't the breathing kind, is it? Invisible ink on sheet music I can do, but I'm a civilian and I do what I do on my terms, and moving human packages is not... Bijou. Nobody move! Papers on the table! Papers on the table. You're sure you weren't followed? We took every precaution. You better hope your papers are good. Does this... happen a lot? Almost never. Oh... (woman moaning) No, no, no, no, please, please, please! Try not to move! I want to help you. (moaning) Sorry. Okay. When did this happen? Last night. We heard a plane... really close. Really close. (moaning) Okay. It's coming! I have to stop the bleeding, right? Hang on! Hang on! Is it too tight? No, tighter. It's all right. My name is Gabriel. Danielle. It's all right. You'll be all right. (moaning) Would you mind staying? I'm not going anywhere. Monsieur? Have I not treated your officers well enough this week? You should keep a more respectful tone. Respectful? Why yes, sir. I'm sure my fans at the Wehrmacht would be disappointed to see my shows disrupted. You should remember you're a guest here. And you should remember you're not the one really calling the shots. Kapiert? Captain! (sighing) Nicely handled. The attitude sells it. It's how come I can move around. Portugal, Italy, Berlin; I will play for anyone. Don't matter none to me. No special loyalty to Uncle Sam? Maybe the day he starts treating me like a citizen. I just help out 'cause I don't like bullies. Now hold on! Wait a minute! Hey! Hey! Wait a minute, now! Hold on! Hey! What do you think you're doing? We're in the middle of a show! Get your hands off my goddamn horn player! (screaming) Please! Please, no! Please! Arnelle! Enough! Take him. These two as well. No, no, no! (shouting) (whispering): What's going on? We just lost two of our team. What do we do? Plan A was you stay with your crew, and the underground take you, just like you were told! What's plan B? This  was  plan B. You fellas are late. Which one of you is the "package"? What happened? We were raided. Five minutes after your friends got here. Now you tell me that wasn't just bad luck. Where's Harry? We're expecting one more. Young lad, brown hair, glasses. Like I need more of you on my hands. In. Go. Miss, in. Alphonse. What were you thinking? I'm sorry, it was a reflex. Don't be sentimental! It leads to bad judgment. 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. Sir! Listen, I can't be here. I'm in the middle of a show with Hallie DuVernay. Hallie DuVernay! You know my photograph? From Ville-Marie. You know that it's been seen. And maybe copied. And you... What if they decide to interrogate you? How long do you think you'll last? You. You! You were there. You saw my Hallie. How's she doing? They didn't take her, right? They didn't take her. I think he might be more of a problem. The messed-up notes. He couldn't finger the valves. I think he's in withdrawal. It's okay, it's okay. (moaning) Oh no, no. Your pulse is low. You've lost too much blood. Do you know your blood type? O. That's good. That's good. Why do you have that? I found it on a German soldier. They bombed the factory I worked in. I escaped. No way I'm working for the Boches any more. You sound like Luc, my husband. The only good thing to come out of being gassed in the last war: He's too weak to be of use to the Germans. I get to keep him at home. This is okay. It's good. Keep talking. Keep talking. You're doing fine. We thought we were done, two children, but this one came along. I've got three brothers. They liked to team up on me. I used to have to hide from them. (moaning) Angeline likes to hide too. She hides when there's company. When I was hiding, no one came looking. Well, except my mother. When my dad... when he was out back playing with my brothers, she would give me word games, you know, crossword puzzles? She taught me the periodic table when I was nine. Hey. Angeline, right? Is she your youngest? Teresa. We named her for my mother. I love that name. Carry your own damn package! It's one gig in Spain, okay. He goes through with your boys, and then the second that he's over the border, we have an MI-9 team that'll take him the rest of the way. He writes my music. He leads my band. Marcus? There ain't no way I'm leaving here without him. What if we get him out of jail? Would you take Walter across the border then? You get him out, maybe I can get behind this. We'll need you to book train tickets. To Madrid tomorrow, 11:15 a.m. Thank you. Marcus is... he's not well. Get him out soon. Please. Where are you going? Reconnaissance. You and me. We got work to do. Monsieur! Monsieur, please! That man, he is in distress! That man's a drug addict. Just mind your own business, madame. You must be special. The Gestapo don't usually sit down with mongrels. Capitaine! Capitaine! My husband and I... we can't imagine how we ended up here. We just wanted to hear some jazz. Please. We are supposed to be on a train for Madrid tomorrow. It will be light soon. They will confirm your identities and I'm sure something can be worked out. Loud and clear. He wants a bribe. Now, bottle not buttle. Bottel of beer. Good. What's your name again? Dave Porter. No, Porder. You've got to flatten the "T," all right? Lazy up your diction. Porder. All right, Dave, where are you from? Wichita. Why aren't you in uniform? 4F. Syphilis. Just helps if it's something specific. Talk as little as possible. And um, any chance you play the trumpet? I used to play the cornet. Close enough. What can you play? Marches, mainly. Blue Bonnets over the Border. That sort of thing. Yeah, on second thought, don't worry about it. As long as we've got your new papers and your cover name on... the album. 
 
 Are you all right? Fine, just a little lightheaded. How's the pain? Nothing I haven't felt before. You look better. You look worse. What about your family? Do they know where you are? They... They think I'm in an office. Somewhere safe. Don't you write to them? I try to write. I just... I can't tell them... I mean, I... I don't want my mother to worry. Every mother worries. I just wish I could tell her... you know... more. But what would I say? She's proud of you. I'm not so sure. If you were mine, I'd be proud. Danielle... I'm so sorry. Your family... Shh... I know. Let me out of here! I can't be here! Just get Hallie DuVernay! I need to talk to Hallie! Get Hallie to me, please! He's going to talk. If they break him, we're all in line to get shot. Guard! Sir! Sir, please! I just need some water. Come on now! Don't you turn your back on me! Don't turn your back on me! I know you hear me! Please give me some water! All I ask... just give me some water! I've got thirst! I need water! (whistling) What? It's a French Canadian folk song. I taught it to the boys. It's one of them out there. Your party trick. (chirping like a bird) Dave, you're now an official member of the band. They all right? So far. But the Gestapo are coming, and Marcus is not in a good way. I found heroin in his case, hidden in a bible. We used to pinch addicts in Shanghai. Put them in a cell; wait for them to cough up dealers when the shakes hit. It sounds like they're hitting already. Aurora says the coppers here are open for business. Bribery works. It's supposed to last us to Paris. We'll find a way. All right, I'll do the talking. Does anyone have a spare suit? Thank you, Sam. Get him one. I got the tickets. You got Marcus? Tom is going to get him. Miss DuVernay, how good is Marcus with secrets? He... Dex? What is it? He begged me not to tell you, Hallie. Someone sold him some, just last night. Then they talked till the sun came up. Then he says to me, he don't remember what he might have said. 'Cept it might have been 'bout how brave you are. For what you do. That was just last night? And you got raided today. Why'd they bother raiding the whole club? Why didn't they just take me? You have friends in high places. They won't touch you until they're sure, which they will be as soon they put pressure on Marcus. Tom. Ready. Hallie, we're going to get him out. They'll never let him go. Yeah. Hope for the best, but... just in case... We've got an extraction plan for the bombardier. Raoul's working with MI-9 in Madrid. And the American recruits are here. They came with the Brigadier General. Ned Butler's with them? He didn't mention a visit. This is about Nightingale. Brigadier General. Ned, c'mon now! Here they are. Ready for your worst. Gentlemen, this is Krystina. She and her girls will keep you safe in the field. If you get that far. Let's sign the Secrets Act, I'll show you to your quarters, the mess hall, get you fed. You boys like steak? Yeah! Welcome to Camp X. Follow me. It's after five. Bonjour, monsieur. I am Jules Bonnet, for M. and Mme Favreau. (muffled conversation) Non. M. and Mme Favreau, I'm Jules Bonnet, your legal representative. I've spoken to the police, and you'll be released shortly. Thank you. There was another person with us. I'm afraid I cannot take on another client at this time. But he can't be left behind. You understand. Yes. Perhaps you can provide him with some consolation in his hardship. Some comfort. Some peace. There will be some forms to sign for your release. I shouldn't be longer than a half hour. Bijou. I can't disclose anything. Except to say that we're doing our unmost to protect Nightingale. Good. Oh, don't t get me wrog, we're not happy. London's overstepped the mark, but that's kind of what they do. It's good you keep their counsel. It means you'll keep ours. We have a possible new asset in the Vichy Administration zone. A mayor, from a town by a very important railway line in St. Antoine. Interesting. Protocol says that we contact London, but you're the one who has our confidence. It's why we send you our boys until we get set up. Thank you. (knocking) Come in. Well, there you are, darlin'. My boys treat you right? They did. Mike told me the name of the guy who recruited him. Steve mentioned he's got a police record in Oregon. He's surprised you didn't catch it. And Jay says his brother's unit is heading to North Africa? Americans are a very friendly people. To a fault. Message received. We will work on that. Well, it's good to meet you at last. You as well. She don't get scared. Not Hallie. But me, I can't write. She say "Boy, you got greatness in you." You do. You know they're coming for you. And they'll want to know about Hallie. And they'll break me, too. Shames me, but it's true. There's a record where you hit an A over high C. Pure and perfect. Do you remember? Creole Hot July. But I can't hit that note no more. Most people never touch greatness. You did. I bet you'd be strong enough to keep Hallie safe, if you had the means. A over high C. You did that. You and Hallie. They can't take your greatness away from you, if you don't let them. My shame. Not today. (sniffing) Come here. Come here a sec. Can you tell Hallie something for me? (birds chirping) (woman screaming in pain) Good, good, good, good, good! (screaming) Push. (screaming) That's good, that's good. Push! Push, Danielle! Push! Come on, we're so close! Good, good, good, good, good! It's here! It's here! (baby crying) It's a girl! I'm going to cut the cord, okay, like you said. She's perfect. Oh, my baby. Okay, there's blood. Tell me what to do. What do I do? Danielle? Danielle! Danielle! What do I do? You're bleeding! You're bleeding too fast! I didn't... I didn't ask for any of this, you know. You lot never do. It just comes. Automatic-like. I was perfectly able to make it back on my own steam. Course you were, mate. For the nerves. When you get home, you can tell Daddy you met face to face with the strings that get pulled when he picks up a phone. I can do more than that. Your family. I can get them a message. They're dead. All of them? Yeah. That can't be. Not all. I have a niece. She was sent back north. Where? North Allerton, with the other orphans. Not your cup of tea. I wouldn't worry about it. I'll find her. I can pull strings too. Please. It's a lily. They look different here. Her name's Mags Cleary. She's eight. I'll tell her all about you. You'd make a great spy, Walter. (scoffing) Yeah, right. Just tell her I'm all right. That I'll come for her as soon as... Where's Marcus? Marcus... didn't make it. I'm sorry. How the hell did he get the drugs? They didn't search him. You were in the cell with him? Hallie, he... Can't the man speak for himself? Your records. The music was sandy and there was sun in there... and he'd hit a high note and the sky would split blue. A blue I never saw before. What the hell are you talking about? Your voice. Your band. He told me he tried to leave. He felt he was holding you back. And you wouldn't let him go. It's been a long road from New Orleans. There is no way I'd let that man go. He knew what he was doing at the end. He said you'd be safer this way. You and everyone who depends on you as Nightingale. He also said he was ready to "come home." He wanted to "come home"? And that you'd know what he meant. (humming) That's how he started it, so simple. (humming) Wanna Come Home. It's just a song we used to play. What was it you said again? "Sky's split blue?" I guess we better get ready to go. Nice work. Work? (vehicle approaching) (baby crying) Papers? Sorry, I don't have them with me. Where is the mother? She died. Father too. I found her. I'm taking her to the monastery. We'll take you there. Hey, sugar. American? That's right. Oh, honey, no. We were American. See, now we're musicians. Citizens of the wide-open world. Of course you are. Your instrument. Let me see. Open it. I used to play myself. Yeah? But not so good. Play me the  Radetzky. 'Fraid I don't know it. You want to give it a whirl? Honey, it is not too late to audition. No, no. My playing is not so good. Something else. Anything. More, please. Now.
