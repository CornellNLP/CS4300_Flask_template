 Previously on  X Company... 
 It's the systematic extermination of Jews. 
 They call it a concentration camp. 
 My cousin Lotte. In Nurnberg. 
 She stopped writing last year. 
 They all want to go east, but my cousin said it was dangerous! 
 I told you there's a doctor in the Marais who can get us out! 
 No! Listen to me. You can't go back. 
 I have colleagues on the outside, right now, helping me plan a breakout. 
 The men who escape with me will help train Resistance fighters from here all the way to the Northern Coast. 
 I want to come with you. 
 Please, let me hunt with you. 
 Counter-intelligence. We need to protect ourselves. 
 Anticipate attacks. Track his movements. 
 And by "him" you mean... 
 Franz Faber. 
 It's time we learned more about him. 
 I'm glad you'll be going somewhere safe. 
 You're going back, aren't you? 
 Yeah. 
 S02E05 
Nil Nocere 
 Harry : So why'd you turn down the Americans? 
 I'd rather do than teach. 
 You could be home, square meals. 
 But then who's going to bail your sorry ass out of trouble? 
 So we're living wild, huh? 
 Yeah, it's great. 
 You just gotta love the no running water, the bad cooking and the moving the camp all the time. 
 I thought Aurora found a safe house in Paris? 
 She did, but we've got five POWs and four new recruits. 
 Family's growing. We gotta train them somewhere. Here. 
 Thanks. 
 Drabek got out? Do you know what happened to him? 
 Word is he got time with Churchill. 
 Showed him his drawings, told him his eyewitness story. 
 That's amazing. So what happens now? 
 You can't put concentration camps out of business by bombing them. 
 What, so you're saying getting him out was all for nothing? 
 No, I'm saying that we need to win the war faster. 
 Look, it's not all bad news. 
 Remember Alfred's rumour about that doctor who's helping Jews out of Paris? 
 Yeah? 
 It's not a rumour. 
 (keys clinking) 
 Neil : No noise. Don't give him time to react. 
 Quick and quiet. Speed and surprise. 
 Good. 
 OK, again. 
 Boche have started carrying their rifles left shoulder, arm 45 degrees out. You come in from behind Fritz, flex, pull, you go in for the gun and a knockout blow. 
 With all due respect. 
 Yes, George. 
 How long is this expected to go on? 
 We're to continue manoeuvres and civilian training until we get our orders. 
 With stick rifles and rock grenades? 
 So I'm correct in assuming our primary offensive weapon is strong language? 
 George, we're working on it. 
 You do remember my men died for us to be here? 
 (woman): You wanna back up and fight him for it. 
 How are we supposed to get a weapons drop when we can't organize a bloody plane? 
 You know splinters don't get you a Purple Heart. 
 Look at you. Cheated death, now back in the saddle. 
 He's going to be insufferable now. 
 Come here. 
 Ow, ow, ow! 
 Still wounded! 
 Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 Ah. Just a scratch. 
 Dick. 
 Alfred. I heard. 
 Impressive. 
 It's good to have you back. 
 He found your doctor. 
 Are you serious? 
 Rumours from half a dozen cells turned into one name and address. You remember where those refugees were, right? 
 I know where they were 10 days ago. 
 Let's go find them. Finally we get to actually do something. 
 Aurora needs you first. 
 Yeah. See if you can find those people and I'll make contact with the doctor after I see her. 
 Good. Meanwhile, it's time we showed these men good faith. 
 What do you mean? 
 It's like young Harry said, it's time we do something. Miri! 
 Let's go find some real weapons. 
 Careful. It's loaded. 
 (knocking) 
 Tom. 
 Hey. (laughing) 
 (sighing) 
 How are you feeling? How was the flight? 
 The flight, the hayride, cargo train... everything was fine. 
 Good. 
 I brought what you asked for. 
 Some of my best work. 
 You always say that. 
 But these are my first works of art in German. Special Nazi stamps and everything. 
 Helene Bauer. 
 And this. You wanted a best-seller. 
 "My Dark Destiny." 
 I'll tell you the plot Picture of Aryan perfection. And... this. It's a good cover. A woman alone in Paris. A widow. Keeps it real. All right. Make her come to you. Don't rush anything. If I spot any trouble, I will signal you and we will abort immediately. I'll just break the ice. Take it slowly. Make her want to see me again. Here we go. (children laughing and talking) Sometimes I don't think before I talk... No, it's not your fault. It's just that I haven't spoken German in Paris in so long... Don't be silly. You did nothing wrong. Could we just start again? Please. You've got papers, right? It's a little late to be asking. You don't look like a Marie. The nuns chose that. They figured it was close enough to Miri. Nuns made these papers? Mm-hmm. Our Lady of the Immaculate Forgers. If anyone stops us, don't be too eager to show them. Show a little French annoyance. It makes you less suspicious. What are we doing? German supply truck makes its rounds twice a week. We're looking for ammunition. Weapons if we're lucky. The building we're targeting's secluded. There are soldiers? There'll be three. If we brought guns, we could shoot them and take what we need. You can't shoot your way out every time. Unless you're a cowboy, which you're not. You think you're funny? Sometimes the best way to win a fight is to prevent it. Especially when you're outnumbered. Why are you always spoiling for a fight? I don't like Germans. Nobody likes Germans. I'm not sure Germans like Germans. Careful. Nearly got a smile there. Where is it you're from? The moon. Ah, course. Yeah, should've known they'd invade there too. Probably why the tides are so punctual. And there it is. Lady from the moon smiles. See, I get by. (man): Can you believe this?! Maybe we shouldn't draw too much attention. If you like. I need to freshen up. Excuse me for a moment. Of course. What did we say about not pushing things? She invited me. She said she loves this cafe but never gets to go. First impressions? Her father cried for joy that Paris was spared from bombing. Nazis do have a heart. (Aurora scoffs.) Keep it simple. Lend her the book or something. All we need is any excuse for you to see her again. You know you should go. I'm not leaving you without a spotter. Today's just coffee. She's coming. Go. Be careful. Go. What was that? You know, some men just don't understand when you're not interested. (Sabine chuckles.) (insects chirping) You sure we're going the right way? That tree we passed? The one struck by lightning? We're going the right way. Right. I guess you don't get lost in the woods much, eh? (Harry chuckling) It's good to see you happy. It's good to finally be doing something useful. (leaves rustling) Jacob! You remember me? Please. Do you have some food? Yeah. Where are the others? We couldn't stay together. They were walking in the night, and I couldn't leave my mother. She's... she's sick. Why are you here? Go on. You tell him. We're gonna try to get you out of France. This way. (indistinct chatter) What are you doing here?! Move back. Slowly. Keep your hands up! Who are you? I'm sorry, is something wrong? Show me your papers! Now! Stop it! He's one of mine! You got what you came for, now go! Now then, how are you feeling? Better since last time, hm? Yes. Has anyone ever told you you have  a historically unlucky sense of timing? (with French accent): More times than you'd think. My name is Patrice Lamarre. I was wondering if you could help me with something. You may wait here for five minutes, hm? Then go. I'm not accepting new patients. Ah, please. I'm recovering from a wound. Could I get you get you to take a look at this? How did it happen? We've established I'm unlucky. There's a lot of that luck going around. Oh, it's healing well. Still sensitive? Yes. Well... Keep doing whatever you are doing, you don't need me. Be careful. Do you treat a lot of Nazis? Why do you care? Because I do. A couple of Wehrmacht conscripts came in first. They heard I was "friendly" if you got into social trouble. Social trouble? Then three Luftwaffe pilots two weeks ago. I expect a Panzer crew next. For a master race with superior moral fibre, it's surprising how many of them get the itch. Mm... Penicillin. I don't write them up or report it to their commanders. They get treated. They don't spread it to other Frenchwomen, and that's the only part I really care about. I promised them there would be no one here. They were scared. And scared Germans are... Unpredictable. Especially when they're itchy. (small chuckle) (without accent): Doctor Durand. I came here to talk about your other sideline. Who are you? You don't need to know my real name. I don't know what you mean by "sideline. Please. You're a source for hope. And I have "patients" who could use your help. There's been a misunderstanding. I'm going to ask you to leave. (giggling) Oh, we didn't order dessert. Rote Grutze. You and your husband were kind enough to be our guests last month. If you enjoy this special offering, please tell your husband. And others. Thank you so much. He seems to be impressed by your husband. Franz does look impressive. It's the uniform. Oh, is he in the military? He is. And yours? I was married to a civilian. Max. A contractor. But he's no longer with us. I'm so sorry. Oh... I don't... Where do they get all the sugar? What was Max like? Um... He was kind. He had long, slender hands. He was tall. And he wrote beautifully. He believed that words could stop wars. I'm sorry. It's making me miss him. My first term at university, Franz used to work for my professor. Mm-hm? He would stare at me while the old man went on and on. I was just 18. But I knew enough to stare back. On our first date he found out I was scared of the woods. That's funny. He thought so, too. So he said, "Sabine, fear makes you strong if you face it." Oh. That's good advice. I'm sorry. Such a chatterbox today. It's just... it's been so long since I had someone to talk to. Don't you dare be sorry, Sabine. I feel the same way. You know, the truth is, I work with men all day and right now, I cannot believe how nice it is to be talking to a woman. I thought I told you to go away. You did. But I kept thinking, a doctor in the Marais, not taking on new patients? No appointments in the middle of the day, no one coming, or going. So it's true. Most of your patients aren't around anymore, are they? These soldiers, they keep turning up. I can't risk it! I'm not helping anymore. Tell me how you did it, then. Let me take the risk. It's not something you could do. My friends are hiding in the woods 20 kilometres from here. They'll die. A lot of people are dying. The world has gone mad. Again. What do you think those German commanders will do when they find out about your social sideline? You want me to help people, but you are threatening to make me cooperate? What can I say? The world's gone mad. 
 
 You're bluffing. Try me. 3000 francs. Each. It's not for me. The path to Switzerland is paved with bribes. You want to know how I get people out? That's how. That's the door. Truck will pull up in front. What do you think? Distract them. Take their guns, shoot them. Run. Good plan, if you're a cat. You'd need nine lives to make that work. The more Nazis you kill, the more come after you. (honking) Here we go. (indistinct chatter) We wait for the right moment, better our odds. Max would work late almost every night but what can you do? Especially these days. And sometimes he would bring his briefcase home, and keep working even after dinner. Franz as well! Even when he's early, he closes the door to his office and I'm all alone again. It's not right to have an office in the home, is it? And today he won't be home till after dinner! Sometimes I... Excuse me. No fruit or sugar for six months! I hope you're enjoying your dessert. My friend and I came here to share a coffee, without judgment. Ah, well, why don't you take my ration card, huh? Take our bread and our cabbage too. Andre, please, I must ask you to leave. Don't worry. I'm going to go. I've lost my appetite. You have no right! You don't know us! Sabine, it's all right- (gasping) I'm so sorry, Madame. It's not your fault. No, it was mine. Your dress... you need to change, before the stain sets. Yes. I'll walk you home, hm? It's the least I can do. And then you'll come upstairs for a coffee. So that we can continue talking. Why not? Come. (laughing and talking) Wait till they're inside. We'll have about a minute. Brush past, get close, don't let him see your face. Leave him wanting more. Remember, we want him looking at you, not me. Get your hands off our ball. Give it back, you pig! Get off the street. (grunting) (boy): Let's go! Check the truck. Here. Stop! Put down the box and raise your hands... Bloody hell. Go! Go! Behind the truck. (heavy breathing) (whispering): I've got the gun. Shh. Halt! (gunfire) Halt! (gunshot) (grunt) Stehen bleiben! We have to let him go. Get the gun. Jacob : What is this? Tom : It's genius is what it is. Even the Nazis won't look too closely at a van transporting tuberculosis patients. Dr. Maurice Durand, this is Jacob Katz and his mother, Elise Katz. Madame, I am sorry for your trouble. A terrible time for France. I'm glad to know you both. Where will you take them? A sanitarium near the Swiss border, near La Cure. You'll stay overnight in an empty wing with no patients. You'll be safe. And how does the crossing work? Madame, have you ever been to La Cure before? No. It used to be in France but then the Treaty of Dappes came. Now half the town is Swiss. When the time is right, very early, fewest patrols, we take you through the cellar of the town laundry. By the time you climb the second stairway, you're in Swiss territory. Todah, Doctor. Shall we get the distasteful part out of the way? Here; this is all that we could spare. Doctor. This pen is silver and my father's cufflinks. Madame? This is yours? Yes. I can't take this from you. This, then. It's my father's. It's valuable. What? No! No, no, no. Please. I want to. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you. Be careful. Thank you, sir. Take your time, madam. At least the heat has broken. Between that and the police sirens, the vans cluttering the streets. I'm so glad that's all over. Do you know what that was? I heard there were riots. Something about the Jews. It's quieter now. That's all I know. (groaning): Oh, no... (quietly): This one. He works with my husband. Good to meet you. Heil  Hitler. (both):  Heil  Hitler. Come on. (dog snarling) Speaking of degenerates... Still found a way to play cowboy. But it was a nice move. I did what I had to. And your hands were busy. Bloody hell. What're you doing? They saw my face. Yeah, I'll guarantee it. I have the gun. If you get caught with that... Please. Take it. You need to disappear. Go tell your family you need to go away for a while. They took my father. They said he's in Germany. Where's your mother? I'm alone. The gun. Can I have money for it? Here. Can I have more? You need work on the hustle. The stealing-a-Nazi-gun part's not sustainable. What's your name? Martin. Where do you sleep? How do you eat? There's always a way. At night. Behind the cafes. Yeah, you never know what you'll find. Let's take him with us. No chance. They've seen his face. He can't stay on the street and take the blame for what we did. He's just a kid. Children know more than you think. They know, in their blood, right from wrong and no one pays attention to them. It makes them invisible. It makes them better fighters. I know the back alleys, the empty houses, the hiding places. He doesn't need charity. He needs a home to fight for. I was thinking we could find a way to copy the doctor's system. What do you mean? Isolate sanitariums within 15 kilometres of the borders. Not just Swiss, but Spanish too. We'd need to find empty TB wards but, yeah. Harry? Check the decrypt? "Request for status. Movement at Swiss border. Heavy German reinforcement at crossings. Basel Railway, Lucelle. La Cure." Jacob and his mother... they're heading right towards a wall of Germans. Do you have to socialize with your husband's coworkers often? It's not my favourite part of the job. That book you're reading? There's not one of them that would look at it. They prefer crisply written reports. (chuckling): Of course. (sighing): I'll have to soak this. Please, take your time. I'll be right back. Can I tell you something? I love Bertholt Brecht. Really? Threepenny Opera. Polly Peachum... I loved her. So willful. And the  Army Song always reminded me of Franz. My father disapproved of Franz too. Half the reason he joined the party was to be more "respectable" to my family, I think. Hm. You do know that Brecht is a Communist. And Weill is a Jew. Who cares about politics? I love those songs. There you are! Franz is... particular about his space. Sabine. I... This is maybe none of my business, but I noticed how you were looking at the children in the park. And you say you have no one to talk to. Did you lose a child? (whispering): I'm so sorry. That's the kind of pain where you... you almost have to make yourself a different person to go on. Braver. Like Polly Peachum. Like you. After Max. I've never seen the view from this window. I see him, in here, staring out. I don't know what he sees or what he thinks. You should ask. You're right. Let's have that coffee. We didn't get to... Um, I'm so sorry. I have an appointment with one of our appraisers. "Prussian Neoclassicists." That's too bad. But he sounds fascinating. We should introduce him to your friend, Gertrude. Or to Kruger's Uncle Leopold! I'm so glad I went to the park today. Ah, so am I. It was going to be such an ordinary day. If you hadn't been reading that book! He's got to have a diary, a phone book. Yeah, we can call his contact, warn him off the border until the Germans back off. Keep an eye out. They could wait a couple days in hiding, maybe try again. Almost got it. What are you doing? Where are they? At the sanitarium, waiting to cross, as we discussed. There's a problem. Come inside. They're reinforcing the border troops everywhere. That complicates things. I can call my contact, tell them to delay. Come in. We worried we wouldn't be able to reach you or the sanitarium. No worries, my friend. Doctor Durand, have your patients ever been close with  Mein Kampf? (muffled conversation) - Any answer yet? No. (creaking) (distant conversation) There's no answer. What does that mean? It's, ah... He may be on rounds. Where's your friend? Ah, keeping watch, I suspect. Don't want any syphilitic soldiers barging in. There's another number we could try, no? My address book. It's in the drawer over there, Nr.9. Could you get it, please? (yelling) (grunting and groaning) (flies buzzing) (grunting) (yelling) (grunting) Harry. Harry! (heavy breathing) (clatter) Their bribes. Their jewelry. Their clothes. He kept them all. He disposes of their bodies in there. (muffled): Do you think it's safe? Maybe they're gone. Jacob! We're right here! It's OK! Are you all right? Are you hurt? He said there were Gestapo upstairs. That's what he told you? There's no Gestapo. But you're safe now, OK? Where's the doctor? He's not who he said he was. He's a murderer. If we'd been any later... You can't stay here. We have a camp just outside of town. Can you walk? No, I can't. I can't go back to the woods, Jacob. Maybe I can hide with Jerome, your father's old partner. They will take me in. What if the Nazis find you? Don't worry about me. Go with them. We'll take you to Jerome's, Madame. And we'll take care of Jacob. Can I ask you a favour? Sure. I want you to teach me to kill silently, like you. I'm not sure that's the best idea in the world. Why? You're asking me to teach you things that make you the weapon. I don't know what you're really fighting. I fight ghosts. Maybe I fight for them. I'm not sure I know the difference anymore. Everyone's gone. Everyone I know. The Germans killed them? Me too. My family, I mean. I can show you some things. We'll start in the morning. I can show you some things, too. Yeah. He kept their passports. The photos. I can't forget their faces. Whole families. I can still feel them looking at me. First Drabek. Now this. The Nazis weren't bad enough on their own. World's going to pieces. No, it's not. The sanitariums, the TB van. We could do that. We could make that work. This is why I came back. We're alive. We get to do something. I'm not going down on the first punch. Soldiers are going to hit the ground soon. And when they do, we'll be ready. We'll mobilize from behind the line. Strike when they least expect... We'll slice every Nazi's throat. And we'll watch them bleed. Baruch Hashem. The decision's been made. Announcer : On the next  X Company... We got the green light? You want to lead this team, Harry? No, Aurora. I want you to. You want to make the tough decisions, you're going to have to live with this. Announcer : X Company, next Wednesday at 9:00 on CBC.
