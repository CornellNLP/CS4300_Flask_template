Kiss of Death 
 Bang! 
 Well, keep to the notes if you need to question him. 
 Again. Hold it tight. 
 Wer sind sie?  Ugh! 
 Argh! 
 Bang! 
 Where did you learn to do this? 
 Second week in Shanghai. 
 Me and my mate were cornered by a street gang. Ready? 
 Everything I knew, it turns out it was bloody useless. 
 It's not just different fighting... it's different thinking. 
 Bang! 
 The day I got out of the hospital, I started training with a master. 
 Then, I tracked those rats down. 
 What about your friend? 
 Your turn. Show me what I did. 
 Sinclair :  How's Alfred's progress? 
 Neil's been working with him on hand-to-hand, but... it's hard. 
 We'll get him there. 
 About Tom... 
 His undercover work is good and the intel he got on Balik is exceptional. 
 It's twice he hasn't been able to pull the trigger when he had to. You're the sergeant, Aurora, what do you do? 
 Keep him on the sidelines? 
 Is that a question? 
 No, sir. 
 You got help from Manhattan. 
 They gave us the words we did the effects. That's a Hungarian paper stock and typewriter. 
 Upshifted H and J keys. 
 You got samples of Balik's handwriting? 
 This should throw the German off a few years. 
 While we get closer to the big bomb. 
 Not the kind of race you want to come in second. 
 Colour coded. You've got 'em straight? 
 If I give Neil the white pill, it's 30 instant minutes of peace and quiet. 
 Just don't confuse it with the stimulant or he'll never shut up. 
 Or with this one. 
 15 seconds and it's over. 
 I know it's hard to wrap your head around it, but trust me, the alternative is worse. 
 Sir, the courier just came from Section F. 
 (people chattering) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Downstream from Villemarie, by the river. 
 They want us to confirm it's Rene. 
 Aurora. 
 Yes? 
 When someone loses someone, protocol is to ask if you'd like time off. 
 But... 
 When I lost my boy... that was the last goddamn thing in the world I wanted to do. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll let you tell Harry and Tom. 
 Ulli. 
 - Ja. 
 Ja. 
 Ja. (kid mumbling) Ulli. Ja. Ulli? Ulli :  Ja? Officer : Ja. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Gerne. Nach Ihnen. (people chattering) Miss Amelie again? Was that wise? I'm perfectly discrete. I need you invisible, not discreet. (metallic clinking) I won't tell you again. Ah, welcome to Poitiers. How was the flight? Told you. Look at his buttons. Sorry to keep you waiting. No, you're not. Research, authenticity, befriending the locals. I take my work very seriously, as should you all. We are 3 streets from the new headquarters. Their presence pollutes my hotel every day, every night. And the slightest slip from you, from any of you, gets me hanged from a meat hook. Clear? Now, how can I help you? A Hungarian physicist named Attila Balik was arrested trying to get out of Spain, and he's being transported to Germany by the SS. Harry's gathered from radio intercepts... that he's expected to arrive at the HQ tonight. We need to get him out of there. Why don't we just ambush the convoy on the way? Tom :  They'll be heavily armed; we'd be too exposed. Harry :  There's no reliable intelligence on which route  they'll actually be taking so... We'd actually be safer  assaulting the headquarters? Safe is relative. The building's vulnerable. The Gestapo just moved in, and it's not as fortified as it will be. Now, the SS have confiscated Balik's weapons research, and they're transporting it by courier to their team of physicists in Berlin. Which  courrier? Felix Andig. He's a regular, part of Drescher's circle, and he will be here tonight enjoying his usual... What's the term? Feminine  relaxation. Yes. Yes. With Colette, which is how we will gain access  to his briefcase in his room. Now, we thought that Colette could help us... No, no. We can't involve anyone outside Madame Sournis. I'll handle it. Can you introduce me to him? He always wants Colette. I'll find a way. Do you think...? I'll find something in your size. Thank you. Go on. Neil, you and Harry will assault the Gestapo HQ and extract Balik, assisted by the Union Corse. Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Union Corse? Yeah, it's all set up. There's no Resistance in this area. Organized criminals, gutter rats... They'd sell their own sister to make a deal. We get weapons and muscle; they get money. Right. So, young Harry and I take on the SS with a band of savage mercenaries while you pour cocktails, listen to gossip and shag pretty girls? Destiny gives each of us a different set of skills, Neil. We will make it work. Alfred, look for the nicest offices, they'll have the best intel. Anything you can find. Counter-intelligence, double agents, watch lists... I'll bring it home. They might even have intel on Rene, right? (inaudible) Take it to the enemy, mate. We'll make them pay. Here they are. Brilliant. Just two of them? You look like a cop. I was a cop. I killed a cop before the war... with a hammer. I killed a cockroach like you before the war without a hammer. OK. Hmm... This is the general layout of the building. We take the rear entrance. Two guards here. Once we're inside, I'll cover this way; you two cover this way. We move together, when I say, so we don't shoot each other. At least not by accident. Or maybe we just go in and shoot some Germans, huh? We're paying you to do it our way, mate. We may have to improvise. We don't know the exact layout. Here, there's a door to the right. It goes to the basement. That's where the secure rooms will be. It used to be a bank. Yeah, I used to like a girl there, but she didn't like me. (dog barking) All right. Let's see what you've brought. Nice. Ho! Ho! Ho! There's a lad. (footsteps) (Madame Sournis sighs.) Make sure he washes himself beforehand. And...? And ask for the money up front. You'll have it perfectly. (Madame Sournis sighs.) He'll want Collette, he always does. We'll take care of that. I hope you won't think it's too personal... But I find, sometimes, it helps to imagine the man you wish it was. (sigh) (piano music playing) (people chattering) Thirsty? How's Collette? Poor thing just threw up. What did you put in her drink? Wanted her out of the way. Lassen Sie uns einen schönen Abend haben. Madame Sournis : What would you like to drink? German officer : Two beers and one cognac. I haven't seen you here before. No. I'm Celeste from Paris. And what did you do in Paris, Celeste? I was an artist. How wonderful! When I was younger, I trained as an artist, too. Did you? Yeah. My instructors told me I was talented, but it's not for me to say. But I've always been inspired by the female nude. Hmm... I'd like to spend more time with you. That would be lovely, but... Come up to my suite. I have a Telefunken turntable. Exquisite sound. Do you like music? Very much, but... Good! Then, it's settled. Come on. Unless there's someone else you need to be. Hmm... Let me just refresh my drink? Right. (people chattering) (piano music playing) (woman laughing) Sturmbandfuehrer, I have something very special for you tonight... Thank you, Madame, but this celestial creature and I already have plans... Monsieur,  tonight is young. Celeste is dessert. Let me warm you up a little with Clara and Roxanne. (women laughing) Na, gut. (officer chuckling) Aussteigen. Help. Morgen. Heil, Hitler. Let's go. Beer and more cognac. (whispering): Don't you dare be late. (inaudible talking) Go. (two gunshots) Felix, this is Celeste from Paris. I thought you two should meet. Where's Colette? Colette's not well tonight. Ah? Don't worry, you'll be beautifully taken care of. Halt! Ugh! Move, move, move! From behind! Stay back! (heart thumping) (muffled gunshots) (normal gunshots) (heart thumping) Get to the offices. I'll cover you. I'll be right behind you. Klaus, zwei da drueben. An der Treppe. (gunshots) Ugh! He's down! We come in a bit. (panting) Il est en retard! (Nazi coughing) Ugh! (heart thumping) (heart beating slower) "Sabine St-Germain. Juliette Marchand. 22 Personen. Auf der Fahrt versteckt. Henriette de Bourcy." Sie war bewaffnet und gehoert vermutlich zur Widerstandsgruppe Partiel. (Alfred reading quickly in German) (Alfred panting) Halt! Haende hoch. (heart thumping) Wer sind Sie? Bang! Alfred? Alfred. Let's go. Come on, we're going for Balik. 
 
 (piano music playing) You! Do you know how to make Silberfuchs? Uh... I'm not sure. Come, I'll show you how. I'll be right with you. Now. I like your name. Felix. Thank you. Happy. Excuse me? In Latin. Doesn't that mean "happy" in Latin? Yes, right. Happy. Madame Sournis told me that she's sending us a bottle of  champagne. Real  champagne. I'm looking forward to getting to know you. Please sit. You know, you're not like the others. What do you mean? Something special... mysterious. Tell me what you like, so I can make you happy. It has to be this way. man : I'm here! Help me! I'm here! Count of three, we fire. No. You don't need him alive. Yes, we do. You just need him out of German hands. Back off or I shoot! Let him do it! You can't let them take me alive... Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Listen. You give us the prisoner... we let you go. Are those motorcycle boots? Yes. You know, I've always wanted to ride a motorbike. May I try them on? Why don't you just get undressed? (knocking on door) Please, come in. The  champagne. Hello. We were expecting you. Would you open it for us? It makes me forget everything. Don't you think? Thank you. The bubbles... burn on your tongue. (Pop!) Beautiful. Thank you. This is perfect. - Prost! Heil Hitler! You're not going to try some? I prefer to stay sober for you. Listen. We... We let you... go free. You go free, ok? You let him... go. I let him go... Yes. You let me go? That's right. OK. Yes, that's right. Yeah? Mmhmm. Come on, put 'em down. Ok. Ok. Ok. There. It's good. It's good. Ok, good. Now, now, now, you... If you give him to me, you go free. Good. (gunshot) Ugh! No, no. It's all right, it's all right. You're Ok, you're Ok. Look at me. (Balik whimpering) It's all right. Look at me. Frenchman : Quickly, come on. Quickly! Hey! That thing, walking right into the line of fire... how about we don't do that again? You don't enjoy a drink after a long day? I like to keep clear. Make an exception. We could make it a game... Now... just one sip. I told you I don't drink! (Aurora moaning) It's enough talking! (Felix panting) Felix... is there something wrong? It's ok, it's ok. (Aurora gasping) There's nothing wrong, do you understand? Nothing! Of course not. But when he asks you... you can't tell him. Tell... tell who? Drescher. He will question you. It's a game for him. It's... I... I don't understand. He... suspects I'm... That you're a... (Aurora sighs.) And Collette... she keeps your secret? Take that. No, no. Please, please take it. Come on. I give you... I'll give twice, three times pay. I'll give you all this. But, please, he can't find out what happened here. You know, they call him the "Bleeder." "Bleeder"? You've heard of him? Tell me. He ties his victims to a chair and takes their blood... for our soldiers at the front. He drains them, slowly, until they break down and talk or die. He calls it sophisticated draining life from Jews, Communists, Resistance... sexual deviants. Someone you knew? Oh, God. He made me watch. He's a monster. He's playing his record player, "softening" the wills of his victims... Wait. The man downstairs, in the bar, that's him? Yes. Yes. Listen to me. I won't say a word. Thank you. (kissing sounds) It's fine. It's going to be fine. Would you prefer I stay? No, you go on downstairs. Are you sure? Yeah. You got a living to make. (people chattering in the distance) What happened? He doesn't drink. Is it done? Yeah, what's wrong? The  Sturmbadnfuehrer downstairs, is he still here? We need to go. Ok, we need to meet the others. He's the Bleeder. OK, but we've got a plane to catch. We're not walking away. There you are! Here I am. So... how was Felix? The man is a stallion. Good... I have to join a few friends for dinner. I was hoping I might persuade you to join me. I would be honoured. (car door closing) (motor revving up) Where are they going? The officers eat at the Bagatelle, Rue de I'eglise. I've got to go. (dog barking) It's the smell, you know? The gunpowder... Smell. (Harry smelling) Where are you? Christie Pits... It's a baseball field. Alfred : Good. What did you get from the office? Watch lists, collaborators, executions... Neil : What else? You got him? Made the switch? Tom : Yeah. Harry : Where's Aurora? Drescher... he's the Bleeder. She went with him to a restaurant. I couldn't stop her. We've got to get her. Non, non, non, non. The deal was we get the man, we go straight to the airlift. The Germans will... We can't leave without her. What about my  cousin? We leave him behind. His blood is still warm on that floor! We can't ask for more from this man, and we can't miss the airlift. They had a file on Villemarie. They had her papers. They've seen her picture. Jesus Christ! (door closing) (people chattering) Oh, thank you. You're welcome. So many elegant uniforms. A special occasion? Just an informal gathering to decide some matters close to the Fuehrer's heart. The Fuehrer... I had no idea. No, you don't. So what do you do, exactly? More than fill out forms, I'm guessing. A little more than that, yeah. I see myself... as a hunter. And what do you hunt? The truth. Ha! The truth? Really? How? It's easy with the locals, the amateurs; little more of a challenge with professionals. Professionals? You know... foreign spies. How exciting. But now we have our man from Paris. He and I disagree on method, but Franz Faber directly reports to the Fuehrer. And of course, we are bound by the same ultimate vision. We'll smoke out the rats. This is no "lady." (Aurora gasps.) Are you, my dear? Ah... Oberfuehrer. Please excuse me... I will go freshen up. I'll escort you. Setzen Sie sich. I can boost the Tatra. Who's the Bleeder? Gestapo torturer. He's supposed to be a rumour. Guess he's not. After you. (Drescher locking the door) Tell me one thing. Yes? A nice girl like you... an artist... why are you working with Madame Sournis? Perhaps we get the formalities out of the way first. (Aurora gasps.) Didn't your Madame tell you? Drescher never pays. Is that right? Yes, that's right. Tell me your name... your real name. Ugh! I'm waiting. Kiss me. You will tell me. I always get the truth. Kiss me. (Drescher moaning) (Aurora grunting) You want the truth? I'm a spy. A professional. This... This is for my friends! And this is for Rene. Ah! (weeping) Who I loved. (gasping) (phone ringing) (Oberfuehrer  speaking German) man :  Allo? Wir koennen sie gemeinsam auswerten. Telephone for you,  Oberfuehrer. Ja. Faber. "April 19th.  Ten Resistance executed by firing squad." Do you remember their names? "Sabine St-Germain, "Juliette Marchand, Joseph Monclair, Henriette de Bourcy, Catherine Marquis, Marcel Boulais..." I risked my life, not theirs. They were supposed to go to the airlift... You're welcome. We weigh the size of the prize against the cost. Now, you eliminated Drescher, and you brought us a name. Franz Faber. That risk was justified, this time. But we just lost one of our own, and the odds are, we may again.  And when that happens, you cannot let your anger overrule your judgment. Now, training's over. From here on, you'll be in France, recruiting resistance on your own until the rest of us land. That photo of Aurora, you destroyed it? It's gone. Thank you. Sinclair :  In the next four weeks, we're going to be hitting the Germans hard. Stealth attacks,  bombs, sabotage. Harry, show us what you've been working on. Uh... What is it? When you heard about Rene, I used to see the same look in my father's eyes. He fought in the First War... set Please. Don't let it... Don't let it what? Hurt me? Haunt me? You're gonna tell me how that works?
