 Previously on "X Company"... 
 Alfred has a condition that's been identified as synesthesia. 
 The brain is cross-wired. One sense is actually Is it true that he remembers  everything he sees? Everything he's seen here, In the next four weeks, we're gonna be hitting the Germans hard. Stealth attacks... Bombs. Go! Sabotage. You were in the Resistance with René Aurora will take over as sergeant. Yes, sir. This is systematic extermination of Jews. They call it a concentration camp. Place to throw away the people. Move! Gotta kick people in the ass. Tell them that looking  the other way is not an option anymore. (screaming) (crying)  Oberfuhrer Franz Faber  knows about you. He knows about your friend with the memory. You're walking into a trap. You're an agent for the Germans? I'm so sorry. Don't move! Drop your weapon! It's Alfred they wanted! If he's ever in danger of being captured, he can never be taken alive. Sir. It's Alfred. You're going to tell me everything you know. (military drumming) Everything on these walls  is compromised. Volontaires de la liberté, Armée secrete compromised. (Morse code beeping) Everything? Anything he would have seen while he trained. The timing of his capture... I know. It's a disaster! Just when we need all hands on deck. I'm aware. Those Denmark circuits were active too. He was your protégé, your calculated risk. Do you know how long agents last under interrogation? The strong ones? Under 24 hours. You know it has to happen, Duncan. I take full responsibility. (Morse code beeping) Incoming from Harry again. You know what to do. (clicking) (Morse code beeping) (Morse code beeping) (Morse code beeping) "Nothing at this time. Stand by for orders." Again! That doesn't make any sense. They're cutting us off. We'll have to change our appearance. They got a good look at us at the docks. The glasses he left; any of them fit? Yeah. You're sure this place is safe? It's the one place Alfred doesn't know about. Sinclair thought ahead. (Knock-knock-knock!) (Knock-knock! Knock!) They're here! (man groaning in pain) Put him, put him here! Harry : What happened? A bit of a dust-up with the roundup police. Watch your head. (man gasping in pain) Should have seen him though, shooting like a cowboy. He saved my skin. I saw the mark at the gate. How'd the catacombs get compromised? You know the nurse that was helping us in Marmonne? She was working for Franz Faber. She was? She led us into an ambush. They have Alfred. (blows landing) (man gasping in pain) This won't end until you start talking. (blows landing) (gasping in pain) Aaah! (Morse code beeping) S02E01 
Creon Via London (gasping in pain) How the hell would the Germans know to take just him? Harry? What? You were there too, we both saw. They took Alfred... And they knew to single him out, how? Neil, that's not helping. It was the morphine. It's my fault. I said too much. Fantastic! What else does she know? What does it matter? They've got Alfred, they're gonna know everything, right? He wasn't supposed to have been taken alive in the first place! They dragged him out of range, they threw him in the car, and I didn't have the shot! Jesus Christ! There's fragments still in here; he's still bleeding. I can see that! He needs a professional. We can't take him to a hospital. What about the radio? No, we're cut off. OK, we need the nurse. She's a traitor! She sold us out! She's the only one who can help him. It's insane to think she's not gonna do it again. Do we have a choice, Harry?! She's a liar! She lies! Do you understand that? We can't trust a word she says! We don't need to trust her; we just... we just need to get her here. At gunpoint if necessary. I'll go. Where? We don't even know where she is. Anton went after her. I know his safe house. Yeah, so does Alfred. Watch yourself. Harry, stay by the radio. (gasping in pain) (door opening) (door closing) Forst. Sir, you asked to see me? Yes. I'm handling Colonel Sinclair's duties for now. During which time I'll need you to fill me in on the day-to-day. How long will he be away? He was responsible for putting a very vulnerable agent in the field. Any further information is need-to-know. Would you close the door? There's one thing I can share with you. Sir. The Allies are preparing an invasion on the North Coast of France. I see. We need your service to rally on the ground to cripple the enemy's ability to strike back. The timing... Yes, I know. We've had to put all our networks under quarantine. We need to rebuild everything from the bottom up. How long away? Four weeks. Four weeks? (gasping in pain) How many networks operating in Paris? Talk to us now or we bring in the others. The boy? Harry? I ask again. How many allied networks in Paris? (gasping in pain) The moment you are willing to talk... (blows landing) Please! Yes, please. Just please just stop! (Alfred breathing hard) I'll tell you what you want to know. (Alfred weeping) (people chattering) (Bzz-bzz-bzz! Bzz-bzz! Bzz!) I caught her coming back for her medical bag and money. She was trying to get out of town. I radioed for instructions; every network's gone dead. What the hell's going on? Where'd you put her? Locked her in the bedroom. What about Drabek? We know an artist, uncompromised. He's gonna help him get out through Spain. It's the best we can do. On foot? Look, we shouldn't even be talking. Christ! What the hell is going on here?! No! No! Damnit! I'm not gonna let you do this. Come on! Look at me! (nurse gasping and crying) I need you to snap out of it! You want to die? Huh? I'd be happy to help you with that, but first you've got work to do. (nurse vomiting and gasping) Come on. You're not done yet. (nurse vomiting) You know, you can't stay here because of her. I need you to pack your radio, put the signal in the window and run. I'll take care of her. OK. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look at me. Are you sorry enough to do something about it? Huh? 'Cause you're in luck. I'm gonna you one chance. One chance. to make things right. Let's go. Come on. Is Harry all right? He's peachy. Come on. Let's go! 4-4-1-6. Fieldcrest. 4-4HG... 51a, 4-9-0-6. Underwood. These are codes? I'm telling you everything. 6-0-6-5, 3-0-2-3. A LiteFlyte. 4-9-7-1. These are serial numbers for typewriters. (footsteps) (gasping in pain) Do you think this is a game?! (gasping) (screaming and gasping) (breathing slowing down) (muffled hitting) Just hang on, mate. Yeah, help's coming. Just hang on, don't you go anywhere. This is nice. What is? Us holding hands like this. It's gonna make your girlfriend jealous, though. What was her name again? Fei Yen? That is, that is a girl's name, right? (knocking in secret code) Piss off. Welcome back. (moaning in pain) How long ago was he shot? Yesterday afternoon. How long have you been at this game then? "Let me help you, I'm a brave nurse, risking my life for the cause." She's here now, let her work. I didn't know what the Germans were doing, about death camps. I knew nothing. With the police kicking down doors, rounding people up? Go on, how long have you been at it? You, Englishman! Copper no less! It was one of you who kicked my husband's head open on the street. Ha! You want to pretend you and me, we're not at war? You want me to help your friend? Say "please." Please. Let's just make this clear. I didn't plant the knife in Harry's neck; I saved his life. I didn't shoot Tom, but I'll do my best to keep him alive. I will do all I can to make this right, but I will not be judged. Not by you. The wound's infected. Beyond morphine for the pain, there's nothing I can do. He needs treatment, antibiotics. Otherwise, he's got four days... maybe a week before he dies of sepsis. I am sorry. Go on. (muffled hitting) (metallic door opening) (metallic door slamming shut) I've had enough. It's not survivable without treatment. He needs a hospital. There's one not far from here. Yeah, and he's known to the Gestapo. He'd be thrown straight into prison. Harry, try the Camp again. Maybe we can airlift him to England, get him to an infirmary. I suppose I'm of no more use to you now. I know what comes next. Sit down. (fast clicking) (Morse code beeping) Tell us exactly what you told Faber about us. Physical descriptions... your first names, Alfred's memory... Alfred. Any idea where he might be right now? Somewhere secure. I'd guess the Gestapo Headquarters on Avenue Foch. How long would they keep him there? I don't know. It depends, maybe... how long it takes... For him to break. And then he's executed? Or thrown into a work camp? I've heard they take high-value prisoners straight to Berlin. Which he is. We're gonna have to move fast. I need you to go back to the HQ. No, hang on... Find out if he's still in there, what cell he's being held in, how well he's guarded... I'm not sure I can just walk back in there. That's not where we meet, it's not how it works... You want to send her right back to her German friends and just hope they don't follow her back here? Aurora : There's no other way. I'll do it. I'll find out what you need. They still trust me. I can't take back what I did. This... it's the least I can do. (Morse code beeping) Incoming! (indistinct yelling) (metallic door closing) Franz... Haha... Um... (distant yelling and screaming) (distant woman yelling) (distant hitting) (distant German man yelling) (distant hitting) (distant woman screaming) (metallic door opening) (metallic door closing) (Morse code beeping) I must have made a mistake. Can't understand it. Neil : What does it mean? Um, they're saying as little as possible over the air, but "circa" means "around." And these numbers with the N and E... Latitude and longitude. Yeah. I should be able to track that down, shouldn't be too far from Paris. And 2400... Midnight. "Creon via London small shadow." What's that? My eyes only. Sorry. You know what it means? It means... a plane is coming. We need to find a field in this area. We'll signal the pilot from the ground. And I'll boost a car. No. Neil can handle that. I want you to go to the HQ with the nurse. You can join us at the field when she's done. No, I'll go with her in case anything goes wrong. If there's one person she might not rat on right now, it's Harry. It was an act. She says she wants to make things right. If that's true, you're the one she's doing it for. So go with her, tell her whatever it takes to keep her close to you. OK. I'll tell him the plan. (whispering): Whatever it takes. (indistinct whispering) (Tom scoffing) I'm sorry I struck you. I lost my temper. I'm tired. 
 
 (distant indistinct talking) I shouldn't have taken this on. Not today. Here. I was just thinking about my first job in university. Picking  Zuckerruben. I don't know the English word for that. Sugar beets. Sugar... The Fuhrer had quotas to bring agriculture back to pre-war levels, so... my boss... sat at my shoulder, watching how many beets went into the basket, yelling at me. It was terrifying. Still, you want to laugh. "More sugar beets." It's not that different now. I'm not gonna talk. Just give me something I can take back to my superiors like the location of safe houses. Your colleagues will be avoiding them anyway. It will make no difference to their safety, but it will help you live. And even if you don't care, I know there is somebody who does. Somebody who loves you... your mother, your father. What would they say with you gone? I just want to spare the suffering. Beat me all you want; I don't feel it now. The pain? Is it the synesthesia that helped you stop feeling it? I've been building a file on you since you were in Marmonne. Consulted a neurologist in Berlin. This must be unbearable. All your senses fused into one, it must be overwhelming. I prayed for it to go away. For silence. What do you mean? The way the clouds smelled, my mom's voice, the way it tasted. They thought it was cute when I was a boy, but one day he shook me, told me not to talk about it anymore. Who did? "People don't like anomalies. They'll think you're a freak." Your father? He didn't think you were a freak; he was trying to protect you. Protect me? After I'm done, I'll be interned and executed, won't I? What you did was out of loyalty to your country and because of a promise you made to somebody you loved. What you're doing today, it's going to count. I could be a triple agent. The Germans still trust me. I could feed them false information. Harry? What do you think? What do you want me to say? Want the truth? You want to know what I think? I feel sick. 'Cause after that time in Marmonne, I couldn't stop thinking about your face; and now you're in front of me, I don't even want to look at you because I feel sick. I can't even trust what I feel anymore. It was easier, wasn't it? A few days ago when we knew what we were fighting for. When we thought we knew. We're almost there. We can't be seen together. I'll circle around, recon the other side of the building... Harry, I don't expect you to believe me... but I want you to know every second of that night was real. How can I believe you? I don't know you. I know nothing about you. We'll start here. My name's Siobhan. Do you believe that? Be careful... Siobhan. Good afternoon. I'm here to see  Oberfuhrer  Faber. "Siobhan Daly." Miss Daly? You should know better than to present yourself without advance warning. It's very poor security. The news I have is urgent, and tomorrow might be too late. I need to see  Oberfuhrer  Faber personally. The  Oberfuhrer is engaged right now, but,  if you'll come this way, I can spare a little time. Siobhan :  It's a nice office. It's temporary. How is the spy; has he been helpful? I apologize. It isn't my place to ask or yours to know, I shouldn't assume. No, by all means. He's well. As well as can be expected. But first, uh, the information you mentioned? I will ensure personally that  Oberfuhrer  Faber receives it the moment he becomes available. I can... speak freely with you? Of course. I met with the others in Alfred's cell. They trust me. I know where they are right now. (people chattering) The people I work with, they wouldn't understand about your condition: your senses, your memory. They don't see what I see... that you need to be treated differently. I want to help you. My memory also means that I know how long you stood there watching me get beaten. 59 blows. Alfred, your father was trying to protect you by keeping your condition a secret and I could do the same. My father didn't care about protecting me! I can underplay the extent of your memory to my superior. You don't understand. I'm ready for the pain. I'm ready to die. You'd do that to your mother? My mom left me. She couldn't take being with my father anymore. After what he became in the First War, what he saw out there. He wanted silence too. From the war, from me... from raising a freakish boy on his own. What did he do? (Alfred sniffles) I came home, 12 years old, a bang, a burst, horrible colour of a burning smell. I came into the kitchen and found my father and the gun and the blood. His face half gone, still breathing, suffering. I could feel the life... The warmth... Draining out of him, right under my hands. Do you know what that's like? To feel the life of someone you love disappear from your hands? To want it back? The ache? But there's nothing, it's gone. (Faber sniffles.) (Faber sighs.) You do know. (Faber slaps the table.) (bird cawing) (bird cawing) It's empty but I don't like it. It's too exposed. It's better than the last three fields we looked at. Wide open to patrols. I know. Being out after curfew, setting up signal fires, drawing attention... You have a better idea? I don't like it. So you said. Alright, let's go. Come on, move your lazy arse. Bloody hell. I'll be glad to see the back of it. (Tom moaning) Thank you for waiting. This has been very useful. I just have a few more questions. However I can help. You said, uh... Aurora has a contact, yes? Just out of town? Louisette, yes. And they're heading there tomorrow to find safe passage to Spain? That's why you need to go get them now. In the catacombs? That's right. Near the south exit. The catacombs were sealed off last night. There are no agents inside. Yesterday at the docks, our agents saw you talking to the young one, Harry... and then you ran. (Siobhan sighs) You've got it wrong. They report the group took a defensive formation and fired first. As if they had advance warning of what was coming. Maybe that's because your agents looked nothing like dock workers. You will lead us to these people. We will follow you at a discreet distance. If you try to make a run for it, you will be shot. Please do not disappoint us, Miss Daly. (Siobhan gasping with emotion) (phone ringing) (people chattering) (inaudible conversation) (woman screaming) (people talking) Hey, hey! What did she say to you? It makes no sense. What did she say? She said, "Tell him he's in there alive... and tell him that it was real." (insects chirping) (dog barking) (Tom panting) You guys should get some rest. Both of you. What about you? I'll rest when Alfred rests. Now don't go getting used to this, you. There, that should do you to London. And then we'll have bundle you really tight, 'cause it gets cold at that altitude. Neil. What? Tom's not getting on this plane. Do you want to explain that? They said a plane was on its way, but they didn't say they were sending it... for him. Neil : Why else would they send a plane? To make a drop. "Small shadow"? It's a parachute. To drop what? I can't... I can't say. Wait, so the plane is coming... We're meant to receive a package at midnight. That's all. Then why are we here?! Why bring him out here like this?! We couldn't just... leave him behind. And at least out here, we can... we can... We can what? Go on. Say it. Say it in front of him! Hey... It's OK. No, it's bloody not OK! What, you knew about this? I've got the morphine. If I take it all... Jesus! Neil... No! That's not gonna happen. I can't! We can't just give up on him and watch him... Neil, it's OK. No! I'm not letting it happen. I'll take you back to town meself. I'll put you in a hospital. Then we're both dead. We're terrorists known to the police. Bad idea. I'm sorry. (distant engine roaring) We have to go. They're early. Come on. (door closing) (clicking) (plane humming) (plane roaring) Too low for a parachute drop! The plane's in trouble! We should try to get Tom! Go! Change of plans, Tom. The plane's landing. We're gonna try send you home. I have to get you up, pal. Ready? Two, three. (Tom gasping) How's it looking? Ugh! Oil everywhere! It's a mess! OK, what's this then? You've got a passenger. We got hit. Forced to land. We're losing oil. He needs a hospital. Can you get the plane in the air? Sergeant? Working on it, sir! How are we doing? Almost there. Let's get him in! Let's go! Grab it! (Tom gasping in pain) Come on. Come on, Tom! Get up. Neil : Put your leg up. (Tom grunting) crewman : Here we go. We got you. Come on! That's right. Here we come. Standing by, sir! You're gonna be good, mate. Hey! Hey! I'll run a test. No time! Hey! We've got to get out of here! Harry, what's wrong? Uh, they heard the plane. Patrol, three men. Let's move. I'll cover! How far off? Harry : Right behind me! Harry? (suspenseful music) Go, go, go! Got it covered. Go! Aurora : Get to the farmhouse! (gunshots) (ricochets) Hey, what's going on? Neil. Here you go. Harry. Get back there. C'mon, we'll flank them. Soldier : Watch out. In front. Ugh! Argh! It's jammed. Ugh! Hey! It's OK. It's OK. We got 'em. It's OK. It's OK. Come on! Come on! Come on! This is "Creon," I take it, coming via London. Aurora : That's right. You knew? There's a reason you didn't tell me? Protocol. Protocol? You told Tom! Only that the plane wasn't for him. It seemed cruel not to. Your job is to follow protocol, Aurora, not to decide what's cruel or not. Now, we've gotta get Alfred out before he breaks. If he hasn't already. Any idea where he's being held? Harry went to the Gestapo HQ with a nurse. What did you learn? That he's in there. He's alive. Or at least was this afternoon. And her name was Siobhan. Was? She died. So, there's not a lot to go on. Harry, it's a start. Neil : Where'd you get these? That's the HQ. Courtesy of Special Operations. We're in trouble. If we don't get Alfred out before he breaks, we're finished. Your war's over. So this is what we're gonna do. Announcer : On the next  X Company. If we don't get Alfred out and he talks, we're finished. Your war is over. You've all been compromised. You should be split up and reassigned. Is there anything you'd like to say? Announcer : Next Wednesday at 9:00 on CBC.
