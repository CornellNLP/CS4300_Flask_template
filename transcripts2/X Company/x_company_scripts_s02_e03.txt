 Previously on X Company... 
 (thumping and grunting) 
 How was he taken alive? 
 They were all over him. 
 I never had the shot. 
 If he talks, we're finished. 
 Word from London. Tom's on his way back to the camp. 
 What's his condition? 
 Bullet wound, but he's stable. The allies are preparing an invasion on the north coast of France. We'll be ready. (gunshot) (grunt) Go, go, go, go! Don't look at me, please. S02E03 
Sein Und Schein Then tell them it's not a request. It's an order from Colonel Mayhew. Tom. You should be in the infirmary. Nice to see you too. Trying to open that wound? I need to talk to you. Not a good time. The team's on the run. We need an exit plan for Alfred, Sinclair, now René... I have an idea. Congratulations, but you need to lie down. No, it's a way to get to Germany off of the trail... (heavy breathing) Oh! OK. There's a cot in the office. Aurora, what do you think? You know him better than anybody else. He's René. He'll get through this. Just get him home in one piece. Alfred, too. We need to move. The Gestapo are gonna be out in full force. Now, I'm gonna do a formal debrief when we get home, but I need you to talk to René. Why? He's been held captive for three months. And? We need to know now what he might have said. Now, he knows you best. He'll talk to you. He didn't break. Neil : Nine lives and then some. Dunno how he did it. Or you, Alfraido. Lucky buggers. Lucky? He's shot, jumps off a bridge. Evades the Germans for how long? That's René. Unstoppable. Forst. Here. Why won't they airlift you out? The Brits aren't sending any more planes in occupied territory. They lost six in the last two weeks. So Mayhew's arranged an extraction for Alfred, myself and now René. Across the border. The unoccupied zone. Out of range of the Gestapo. But that means we have to cross the demarcation line. Which means using papers. We assume our old ones are blown. René is now the priority. I have papers for Alfred myself. He has nothing. There's gotta be a weak point I can sneak across or under. Line's fortified. It's too dangerous. There's a town... Ste. Lynette. The checkpoint runs right through the middle. Where there's a border there's smugglers, ways to slip through. Could be our best bet. We can't travel together. There are ruins due east of the town. We can meet there. Alfred and I'll go on foot. We'll stay off the roads. We'll take René by car. A car is risky. They'll be watching vehicles. I'm not a cripple. I can walk. No, René. You can't. Gentlemen. We can't be caught with weapons. Let's bury 'em by the tree line and mark it. The Nazis giveth, the Sinclair taketh away. A walking tour of France with Sinclair. Should be fun. I'm sure you two will have a... good chat. I haven't said anything about what happened at the docks when I was arrested. Say what you have to. About René? When I was with him, it wasn't long and I never asked him if he... But he said a name. Brigitte. Who's Brigitte? She meant something to him. They may have used her. We need to know. It's good to see you. You too. See you in Ste. Lynette. man : Papers! A full search of every bloody vehicle. They're looking for enemies of France. They won't let anything through. There's gotta be a way. Man : Next! We need to talk to the locals. Find someone who knows how it's done. Soldier : Here is someone. Christ. Soldier : Get out! Get out! other soldier : Get out! Get out! Stay down. Woman : No! Stop! NOOO! Harry : No. Stop! This is your last warning! (woman sobbing) (crying): NO! NO! The cell, the people, the colour, the noise... everything just went grey. You stopped feeling the pain. I felt nothing. Because your senses went grey, you felt nothing. Would you please just ask? Stop playing and just ask if I broke. Alfred, it's important you tell me everything you remember. You know what I remember? That I thought I would die. In that cell. Alone. And I really didn't think I'd be standing here with you calling me a traitor. That is not what I meant. I didn't break. I would remember if I did. men yelling : Search in the woods. Yes. Two men to the right. Yes, sir. (whispering): OK. We can't wait here. We're too exposed. Maybe we should go back out of town and... (coughing) Or we could stop again. It's fine. No. Keep going. In plain sight. Like we used to. This isn't the way I imagined it. woman : Good afternoon. Seeing you again. It suits you. What does? Being in charge. I'm not so sure. Exactly. The only leaders I've known who didn't feel like imposters were imposters. You knew? Every minute. The trick is no one can know. (with accent): Should I take you home for your nap, then? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Tuck you in. Give you a nice coffee. And a biscuit. I hate you. I hate you too. (guffawing) (whispering): I don't know. He seems pretty friendly with the Germans. He's just doing his job. They took over an airfield last month. Now we get visits. Lots of visits. Monsieur.  We are looking for a way across the line. Hey! Let's see that. "France libre?" I hear these are everywhere now, huh? Clever. You can't be arrested for using currency. Can I keep it? A souvenir? Don't worry; I'll buy you a drink. We don't want a Luftwaffe getting a bad name, do we? No, we don't. Not sure about you. How old are you, little man? (laughing) How old was the child you murdered today? What child? Etienne Parent. He was seven years old. Guilty of trying to see his grandmother at the other side of town. That was not my men. Of course not. Nobody likes an occupation, especially not real soldiers,  Monsieur. I offer my sympathy. And apologies. (sigh) What do you need? We need papers. We have money for a good forger or anyone who helps us, of course. Dugard. Green house, the end of Rue de la Compagne. Bring some lilies. (typewriter tapping) If you're up, you can get back to the infirmary. Don't like having me around? Not when you're distracting my ladies. Do you mind giving me a hand with something? I don't have enough to do? There's gonna be many pissed- off Germans looking for my team. Right. What if we can throw them off their trail? Last time, we shared a bed. Just what I was thinking. Damn cot squeaked. Not when you go extra slow. Extra quiet. Back to the lounge by separate doors. The skills they teach you in this place. It's not bad, but you're gonna need some pictures. I'll get some. I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting company. I was looking for a  Monsieur  Dugard? Monsieur  Dugard passed away. Oh. Um... Gilles... The bartender... he said, um... I brought lilies. Hurry up and get in. I don't know you. We deal in simple things. Coffee, butter... nothing dangerous. Um, it's just that my friend, he lost his papers. Your friend. He's sick. He just ate some bad meat. Did the bad meat give him that bruise? Sharp eyes. They have to be, these days. You're not smugglers. And you're not local. I would know if you were. Resistance? We were just trying to keep it simple. Helping smugglers is a few days in jail. Helping your kind is a bullet in the head. Madame... You asked for lilies. France's flower. You're still a patriot. (coughing) If I could help, how many papers would you need? He's the priority. Could you do new papers for all of us? Why not? I'll get the same bullet for four as for one. There's just one problem. We can pay. I can do the signatures, stamps. I have a darkroom for the photos. But I don't have the paper itself. I have a partner. He gets it from his job. Where is he? On the other side of the line. So we're back to square one. No! If one of you can find a way across, I'll tell you where he lives, where he hides the paper. You go, steal what you need... Steal it? Why can't we just talk to him? Because he is a police officer. You shut up. Oh man stop it. (birds chirping) Why are you following me? I'm not following you. But if you shoot, the Germans will come running. I don't think you want that. You don't know what I want. No, but I know you're wearing a bespoke suit. Kilgore, French and Stanbury. So you're not exactly a woodsman, am I right about that? (grunting) Wait, wait, wait! Please, please! We don't have time for this. What are you doing out here? My name is... my name is Jacob. They started rounding up people in the city and my family and my friends, we took everything we could and started to run. We don't know where to go. Can you help us? Any fresh ideas? Why don't we use the rooftops? They've still got line of sight. Not if we run faster than they can shoot. Commando Harry. I can do more than wear headphones. You know that, right? Why does everyone think I'm... I know what everyone thinks. No one blames you for Siobhan. She was the rat, not you. That doesn't make it any easier. (whistling) Mademoiselle,  eh, Mademoiselle! I like your dress! I have an idea how we might get across. I think these boys are lonely. Here you go, my dear. Is this you? And Albert. Before he went to Morocco for the Republic. He was... a hero. He didn't come back. Take it to your man. I'll be down here. You can be alone. He's, um... We just work together. Young lady, go. While you both have a little time. 
 
 Brought some more hot water. I was thinking that we could, um, talk while... or I could help you. No. René. It's just me. I know. I'm sorry, it's not much food. Thank you. These matches are waterproof. Thank you. We had to run with what we could carry. Some said they were taking people to another town. But my cousin, she heard different stories. We need to get moving. What are you gonna do? They all want to go east, but my cousin said it was dangerous! All day and night, it's your cousin this, your cousin that. I told you, there is a doctor in the Marais who can get us out! No! Listen to me. You can't go back. Please, we are city people. My mother teaches literature. What do we know about living in the woods? Tell us what to do. This won't last. And one day soon, you'll go home. You listen to her cousin. Don't go east. We need to move. Good luck, Jacob. (laughing) I have another. Two English schoolgirls on their way to confession. One girls asks, "What will I get for kissing?" The other girl says, "Usually a pound. That's what the English Bishop pays." Finally, a Frenchman with a sense of humour. So... tell us more about this place. Madame Rouge! Dancing, music... artistic tableaus... What... what is "artistic tableaus"? (chuckling) You know. Professional artist's models. You mean, uh... (honking sound) (laughing) Posing, like in classical art. And these ladies, they are very international. Open-minded. Creative. You know. Can you show us? If you get us across. (chuckling and indistinct conversation) Wait here. Easier than jumping roofs. Alright, gentlemen. So... where is Madame Rouge? Well, this is a big crowd. So we'll just let the ladies know we are coming? This one stays. You go. Wait... is Veronique on the door tonight? Ah, yes, afraid so. She hates me. You go. No, no, no. You know they won't let me in without you. (chuckling): The babyface. Ah, shut up! Just go! Just go. We'll be right back. You'd better not keep us waiting. (whimpering) Apparently I'm the same size as a war hero. Of course you are. Benefits of forging for smugglers. She gets actual cocoa. Wanted us to have a little something sweet. Um... stand. I'll take your picture. Ready? René, who's Brigitte? Remember when this was all there was? What? You and me. I'm sorry. It's OK. (suspenseful music) Got it! No. What? We have to go. Now. Quick. Quick! Come on! Don't move. If you want the money, you can have it. We don't want the money. We just want the papers and then we'll go. How do you know about... Oh, my God. (chuckling) What's so funny? You have met my mother, Jocelyne. Albert Dugard Jr., Inspector of the Vichy Government Police of the French State. Now, if you were going to kill a man in his own house, I think you would have already done it. So, now what? We've got money. Over 250 francs at your mother's house. You get us across safely, you can have it all. Alright. We'll go in my car. You can ride in the back. The guard will not check an officer's vehicle. Now... give me my gun. I don't think so. A policeman without a sidearm? It will look suspicious. We will take the risk. You can have it at your mother's. We lost time back there. Let's pick up the pace. You didn't have to lie to them. To those Jews, in the woods. You told them they could go home. They can go home when the war's over. You know what we saw. Their police, their own neighbours robbed them blind, looted their houses! What do they have to go home to? Alfred! You didn't even have the decency to tell them why they can't go east! The death camps. The gas chambers. The truth. The truth? My job isn't to tell them the truth. My job is to win this war. And if I have to tell these people whatever it is they need to hear so that I can do my job, that is what I will do. And so will you. Now let's move. Yeah. On the AP wire as soon as you can. Thanks, Pete. I owe ya. All done. I will let you finish the layout. Nice work. I know. Well... you belong in the infirmary and I should get back to work. Do you remember the deal we made? I do. Short and sweet. No strings. Which is fine. Still works. But it's a funny thing... when I thought I was done, dying, there was this one memory. The moment that I pulled out your bobby pin. How your hair felt under my hands. How smooth it was. I just... kept seeing it. And I felt... I don't know. Grateful. Just wanted you to know that. Anyway, I don't mean to... No. (whispering): No. It was nice. So you can remember me better. Even when you're not dying. René, we need to talk before you go. We don't have a lot of time. Who is Brigitte? I'm going to debrief with Sinclair when I get home. You can tell me first. You said her name in prison, in front of Alfred. Deal's a deal. Oh, it's not straight! No, it's fine, Madame. Please just keep going. Madame has high standards. My high standards are what keep us in business. You sent them to rob me and didn't tell them I was your son. Robert, please! Just let her concentrate. My son the collaborator! Maybe I was ashamed! Ashamed? And what are you? I am a patriot. Like your father! This again. Madame,  you need to finish. He died for his country. He died in Africa on land his country stole. How is that any different from the Germans? OK, we're almost done. We'll be out of your hair. At least he believed in something. Like these brave souls... Madame... ...fighting the Germans instead of licking their boots! Fighting? Who are you? When I jumped from the bridge, I was barely alive. Brigitte found me. Fed me. Helped me get better. And then the Germans came and they took me. And because of me, they took her. What happened to her, René? After they couldn't make me talk, they brought her in and what they did to her... What did you tell them? I don't know, Aurora... Did you give them names? Our French networks? About our cell? About the camp? What did you tell them? I can't remember. I just talked until I couldn't anymore. To make them stop. They said they would stop. They said she would live. So I talked. I was going to tell Sinclair. I... All of it. I just couldn't tell you. We needed to know this. Why? Because I couldn't stand the idea of you looking at me the way you're looking right now. Harry : Just look, we have your money! You see? Albert : I won't be able to spend it hanging in a German jail! You let them go... Madame,  please! I have to do this! OK, OK. Go to the Gestapo, OK? Take our money and go report us to the Germans. Yeah? Harry. Take the money, go to the Gestapo, yes? You go now. All we need is five minutes. Five minutes, and then you tell them anything you want. Yeah? Do what he says, Albert. Please. Five minutes, Albert. He's not gonna give us five. Not even close. Go get your friends. Hurry! Here. Go! Get the pictures. We need to go, now. Come on! There they are! (men shouting) Neil, Harry, meet us at the ruins! Aurora, I can't keep up. Don't talk. Just move. They are running. Wait. There's no time. You need to run with me! They were just... Ah, come on! I can't. I can't run. Yes you can. Come on, just... I'm hit. Please don't let them take me again. Please don't let them. Please. You can't. It's alright. It's alright. Don't let them. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. Promise me. Promise. I promise. I won't. I'm right here. Aurora... I'm right here, my love. (stabbing) (both gasping) You're not alone. I'm right here. I'm right here with you. I love you. (sobbing) (yelling in German) Look at this alley. (soft piano music) (crickets chirping) 13 weeks ago, you would have jumped out of your skin if you heard a gunshot. You talked down that kid with a shotgun. You got out of a Gestapo prison without breaking. Not bad for a vaudevillian. Thank you. I just have one more question. On the docks, before you were taken, did Aurora have the shot? I saw her. She didn't have it. That's what I needed to hear. I'm not taking you back. What? Now in three weeks, the Allies are mounting an operation on the coast of France. (Alfred's voice reading words) I've already told the others, but what they don't know is what it's really about. Why wouldn't you tell them? Why just me? Because this operation could turn everything around. Everything. And if they were to get caught, they might break, but you won't. I trust you. (running footsteps) Where are the others? Aurora, where's René? (men's voices) Papers? Alright. Aurora :  René was a soldier. I think he'd want to be remembered that way, first. A fighter. Neil : He was a friend. Made me laugh. Even when I didn't want to. He broke. In prison. He, um... he told me, so I told Sinclair and now I'm telling you. What does that mean? It means nothing is safe. Old contacts, safe houses... We can't rely on anything we did before. Well, that's what we were doing anyway. We always knew we could be compromised, just... didn't figure it would be him. Hey, you alright? Stupid question. Sorry. I know Sinclair asked. About whether I had the shot. Why didn't you tell him the truth? Why didn't you shoot me? "A daring band of freedom fighters,  escaping under the cover of the night to Switzerland and then, on to London." (submarine sonar dinging) (dramatic music)
