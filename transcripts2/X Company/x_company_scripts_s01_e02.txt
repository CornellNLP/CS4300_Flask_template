 (woman laughing) 
 (machine gun firing) 
 Ugh! Oh! 
 Who was she? 
 woman : Let me go! 
 (buzzing) 
 (theme music) 
 woman : Forget my name. 
 Everybody, go, go, go, go! 
 S01E02 
Trial By Fire 
 (birds singing) 
 Lighter on your feet, Tom. 
 It's why we call it silent killing. 
 Ugh! 
 Good. Excellent. 
 Well done. 
 And the next step is what? What? We... make sure it's really dead. 
 Don't want another Villemarie, do we Tom? 
 Do it again. 
 Ugh! Ugh! 
 Alfred. 
 Remember. This is not a man. 
 This is a bag of meat. A bag of meat that will kick down your front door take your girlfriend and throw her against the wall. 
 (Alfred panting) 
 Go. 
 GO! 
 coming from a distance : I'm sorry, what part of "kill or be killed" have I not made clear? 
 Ugh! Ah! Ah! 
 (Alfred gasping) 
 That wasn't fair! 
 Are you serious? Fair? 
 You let down your guard when we've won the war, not a moment before. 
 Alfred, it's 3. 
 Sinclair wants to see you. 
 Have you seen what happens when "Afraido" hears loud noises? 
 Gunshots, for instance, and other things that are known to happen in the field. 
 It's just one mission. 
 In hostile territory, yeah. 
 One weak link, we all break. 
 Look, we get him in, we get him out, we take him home... and then we let him sit behind a desk. 
 Where he won't get anyone killed. 
 And you got the HQ? 
 (people chattering) 
 (phone ringing) 
 How's training going? 
 It's a lot on short notice, I know. 
 Why don't they just bring a camera? 
 Because you're more than a camera. 
 Alfred, maps, munitions, schematics, train schedules; all of it locked up here. 
 That kind of advantage in the field is incalculable. 
 Just this once. 
 They'll keep you safe. 
 It's not my safety I'm worried about. 
 This is it. "Ordinary" eyeglasses, right? 
 Yeah, amazing. They do look ordinary. 
 How did you do it, Harry? 
 But ordinary eyeglasses can't open doors, can they? 
 woman : Any news? 
 We've got 2 agents in place, but it's tough. 
 Gestapo are all over Villemarie. 
 But they've looked everywhere? Downstream? The woods? 
 Finding Rene is the priority, yes. 
 In the meantime, Aurora will take over as sergeant. 
 Sir... 
 Aurora, you have the experience. 
 You were in the Resistance with Rene. 
 There has to be that chain of command in the field. 
 Yes, sir. 
 As a bonus, you can move invisibly among those who would make the mistake of underestimating the fairer s*x. 
 Questions? 
 (Neil clearing his throat) 
 No. 
 No, sir. 
 Actually, I have a question about Alfred. 
 Is it true that he remembers everything he sees? 
 The information we've been feeding him... everything he's seen here, it can never fall into enemy hands. 
 Now, your job is to keep him safe, to be his armour. 
 His babysitters. 
 If he's ever in danger of being captured, he can never be taken alive. 
 Understood. 
 Let's go. 
 Alfred! 
 Key intel for this mission comes courtesy of Lieutenant Burgschmidt. 
 "Burgerschmidt"? 
 We're trusting a German P.O.W.? 
 Sinclair : We've borrowed him from the Bowmanville camp, and so far, his intel's been reliable. He worked in a Luftwaffe HQ. 
 He gave us the location of a safe that contained hundreds of one-time codes. 
 If we can read their signal traffic, we get advance warnings on all bombing raids running out of that airfield, including the raids that are hammering Britain as we speak. 
 Not bad for a hot meal and a decent bed. 
 Courier come in? 
 woman : Just now. 
 Thank you. 
 We need to get Alfred in and out. No footprint. 
 If the Germans suspect the codes have been compromised, they'll change them. 
 It's gonna be heavily guarded? 
 Not Monday. Mandatory day of joy. Parades, festivities. 
 Sorry. What's Monday? 
 April 20th. Hitler's birthday. 
 It's a once-a-year opportunity we don't want to miss. 
 "We're here to check the electricals." 
 Wir sind hier wegen der Elektrik. 
 "Which way is the building's main circuit board?" (Alfred repeating in German) 
 Wo ist die Hauptsicherung dieses Gebaudes? 
 "I'm sorry, my German is not very good." 
 Es tut mir Leid Or Entschuldigen Sie... 
 Aber mein Deutsch is nicht sehr gut. 
 Last chance to use the toilet. 
 That wasn't on the... 
 Right. No, I'm fine. 
 (plane engine roaring) 
 How are you doing?! 
 It's actually kind of fun! 
 You get used to it! 
 You mean, like that one time you did it before?! 
 Exactly! 
 But hey, remember! Legs together! 
 (gunshots on metal) 
 (Alfred hyperventilating) 
 Headwind's pushed us behind. They're onto us. 
 We'll drop you here. Best we can do. 
 Hey, I hear you got a promotion. 
 Well done! How are the lads taking it? 
 (gunfire) 
 I have their full confidence. 
 My wife says, "If women ran "the world... (gunfire) 
 (panting) 
 Aurora : Green line! Come on! Everybody, let's go! 
 Go, go, go, go, go! 
 Harry : Alfred, you've got to move! Alfred! 
 Neil : Oou! Move it! 
 Get out now! It's ok! 
 We're going down! Move it! 
 Jump or I'll bloody shoot your ass! 
 (Alfred panting) 
 Alfred, do this! 
 Get out! 
 (wind blowing) 
 (Alfred panting) 
 (gradually breathing slower) 
 (breathing faster again) 
 Oh no. 
 Ugh! 
 God dammit! 
 Tom? 
 (Tom grunting) 
 Dammit! (Tom grunting) 
 Undo the straps, Tom. You've got to drop. 
 It's kind of high up. 
 You can do it. Come on! 
 (clanking) 
 (clanking) 
 (Tom breathing sharply) 
 Ugh! 
 Are you ok? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Alright. Alright. 
 Ugh! 
 Alright. Good job! Ok. 
 We have to get it down. Give me a boost. 
 Alright. 
 Alright? 
 (grunting) 
 boy : Shoot them! 
 Shoot them now! 
 man : You're not thinking. 
 Give it to me! 
 Then what? Huh? 
 Use your head, you idiot! 
 woman : Henri... 
 Henri : What's worth more? Dead spies or alive? Move! 
 Shh! 
 Henri : Go! Go! 
 Shhh! 
 Alfred : What do we do? 
 Neil : We should be halfway to Chartres by now. 
 We can't miss this window. We've got to get 'em out. 
 Let's get a closer look. 
 Henri : Get in! 
 Over there! 
 Against the wall! 
 Having these two in, it's like winning the lottery, huh? 
 We're not here to hurt you. 
 Is that your father? 
 There was nothing left of my father after what you did. 
 Henri : Don't move! 
 We didn't do anything to your father We should kill you now and watch you burn. 
 Your bombs killed my husband in the factory. You didn't think about the lives inside? 
 Take those off. 
 Adele, search for weapons. 
 Maman. 
 Shh. Off. Come on! 
 whispering : They're on the far side. 
 We need to separate them and get their gun. 
 whispering : What do you want me to do? 
 Stay out of the way. 
 They shouldn't have a firearm at all. 
 Germans made it illegal for civilians to own guns. 
 How much German have you learned? 
 About 30 pages. 
 30 pages? 
 From the phrase book. 
 On your knees. 
 Hands behind your head. 
 Get on your bike and go straight to the police station and tell them that Henri Leclerc is holding 2 Allied spies. 
 Go. 
 Go! 
 whispering : Go. 
 (door opening and closing) 
 Madame,I'm sorry you lost your husband. I really am. 
 Where did this happen? 
 In the munitions factory in Sainte-Eugenie. 
 We don't bomb civilians. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, hey! 
 Hey, are you ok? 
 (grunting) 
 We're not the enemy. 
 We would be at peace, and your husband would be alive now, if it weren't for the Germans. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Oeffnen Sie die Tuer. 
 Turn around, face the wall. 
 That's not the police. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Aufmachen. Sofort aufmachen. 
 Henri : Turn around! 
 Henri, the gun, there's a death penalty! 
 (banging on door) 
 (banging on door) 
 (grunting) 
 Let him go! 
 Drop it now! Now! 
 Maman! Maman! 
 Come on, over there! Now! Get on your knees! 
 Henri : Calm down. 
 On your knees! Come on! 
 Hands behind your backs. 
 They're going to kill us. 
 That's what spies do when you've seen them. 
 That should do it. 
 Alright, g give it a try. 
 (Tom groaning) 
 It's definitely sprained. 
 We're barely gonna make it as it is. 
 Tom... you're gonna have to stay behind and deal with them. 
 No, I need you with Alfred. 
 This has to look like an accident and we can't afford the time to set it up. 
 Okay. 
 There's another way to deal with this. 
 If there was another way, we would take it. 
 We're here to build resistance, not kill civilians. 
 They're not recruit material. 
 I know how to read people. I can figure out what they want. 
 I know how to pull their strings. 
 Aurora : What's your plan? 
 I... I don't know yet Don't start the fire until we're a half hour away. Stay out of sight. 
 Do the boy first. 
 It's not right for him to see it. 
 There's only 2 shells. 
 (door closing) 
 What are you doing? 
 Are you going to do us the courtesy of shooting us first... or are you just going to burn us alive? 
 I love you. I am so proud of you... 
 (sniffling) 
 (Tom sighs.) 
 You know what? 
 Let's talk. 
 Ok? 
 Ok? 
 Ok, let's talk. 
 Alfred : 10. 5. 30. 15. 20. 10. 
 10. 30. 45. 10. 10. 5. 
 50. 30. 65. 70. 75. 
 Aurora : Hey, we need to move faster. 
 Alfred : I'm sorry. It's just all the, the... 
 Just focus on one thing. 
 (people chattering) 
 How about me? Just focus on me. 
 We're almost there. 
 What my friend said earlier, she was right. 
 We're with you. We believe that France should be free. 
 Henri : What the hell do you know about France, huh? 
 Tom : A lot more than you think "Billy Deal." I don't believe this. Is this yours? 
 You've been hiding that Yankee trash here, huh? 
 Henri, please, it does not matter, it's just a comic book. 
 Matters because it is illegal. 
 This is not your house. 
 You watch your mouth, little boy. 
 I can read what I want when I want! 
 Just because you decided to "occupy" my mother. 
 "Occupy" your mother?! 
 Put up your feet, make yourself at home where you don't belong; what do you call it? 
 You know what you're asking for, huh? 
 
 
 
 Tom : Hey! 
 (people chattering) 
 (Knock-knock-knock-knock!) 
 (Knock-knock! Knock!) 
 Yes? 
 I was in the neighbourhood. 
 How are you? 
 I have a cold. 
 What do you need for a cold? 
 Hot tea and brandy. 
 You're late. 
 We got held up. 
 Hey, you got a secure line? 
 I'm working on it. 
 Ok. 
 Where's Rene? 
 I'm leading the operation today. 
 Is she serious? 
 Why wouldn't she be serious? 
 Tell Rene we've heard a rumour from Paris about your friends from the Cafe de I'Azur. 
 What? 
 Just... that they met the Bleeder. 
 That's all I heard. I'm sorry. 
 There is no Bleeder. 
 I heard it from the top. 
 Don't spread propaganda, you're just playing into their hands. 
 Alfred. 
 Stay invisible. Play low social status. 
 Keep your eyes down. Speak as little as you can. 
 That, I can do. 
 Crawling with Jerries. 
 We've been shorting the wiring for the last 6 hours. 
 Stick to German. They only hire French who speak. 
 We know. 
 Do you have the work orders? 
 We couldn't get them. 
 It's not good enough. 
 They won't ask. 
 They know something's wrong with lights. 
 Or they ask, and we don't have them. 
 Codes officer finishes his shift in 5 minutes. 
 (beeping in Morse code) He's the last to leave the communications room. 
 He likes to "drink his dinner" at the cafe up the street. 
 8 o'clock sharp every evening. 
 It's time. 
 Alfred, you remember everything? 
 The layout? The room with the safe? 
 Yes. 
 Do what Neil says and does. 
 One last time? 
 Wir sind hier wegen der Elektrik. 
 Good. 
 Any minute. 
 This is my favourite. 
 You, uh... remember that time he shot a rattlesnake from 40 feet away? Perfect aim. 
 Number 112. 
 Double edition. 
 That's right. 
 Your dad liked reading Billy Deal? 
 Yes. 
 He has good taste in Yankee trash. 
 You're American, hm? 
 I am. 
 Yankees stood there with their hands in their pockets when we needed the help, hm? 
 You're right. I stood by. 
 We stood by. But I worked hard to change that. I'm an advertising man, and I worked for over a year... by selling things... selling ideas to mobilize. 
 'Cause when you've got a real enemy, those lines on the map, they mean nothing. I'm here, ok? 
 I may never go home, but I'm here now to help. 
 For your information, the Germans are decent and professional. As long as we help them keep the peace, they look after us. 
 Which I do, so I can provide for Adele and the boy here. 
 Tom : Listen to me. Hey! Hey! 
 Adele : Run, Louis! Go! 
 Tom : Slow down, partner! 
 Adele : Don't hurt him, please! Please, stop it! 
 Let me go! 
 Please, please let me go! Stop! 
 Shh, shh! 
 It's ok I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt you. 
 (Louis panting) 
 I'm not the enemy. 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 Louis : Please... 
 Listen carefully. 
 You need to hear the truth about your dad. 
 I'll need you to pretend your hands are still tied. 
 Ok? You take it and you make your own choice. 
 You understand me? Yeah? 
 Yes. 
 This right now... this might be your only chance. 
 Where is he? 
 You said the codes room would be clear by now. 
 It has been every day until today! 
 First person I had to kill... was in Toronto 2 months ago. 
 They gave me a glove-gun. Single shot. Told me to wait in my hotel room for my target. I didn't know who. 
 They said he'd be there in half an hour, but I was there for 8. 
 Halfway in... I had to pee. 
 But I couldn't leave. I'd never been so scared in my life. 
 And then, the door opened. 
 What happened? 
 I stood up. 
 And my legs were shaking. 
 I took the shot. 
 And... 
 And what? 
 And it was a blank. 
 Training exercise. (Alfred sighs.) 
 But the pee was real. 
 (exclamations of amusement) 
 (fanfare playing outside) 
 We are going to get through this. 
 Jean-Claude. 
 There he is. What did I tell you, huh? 
 Hey! Glasses. 
 (clicking in Morse code) 
 (people talking and cheering) 
 Ja. 
 Ja! 
 They're in. 
 (suspenseful music) 
 (door closing) 
 (Neil sighs.) 
 It's the wrong room. 
 It's not. It's not. 
 Oh, bloody hell! 
 This is the one thing I get right. 
 Which side of the building is this? 
 North. 
 (man talking German outside) 
 (clicking) 
 There's a signal. 
 What's he saying? 
 (clicking) Wrong... room. It's the wrong room. 
 Of course. Get Sinclair. 
 Ok. 
 (clicking) 
 (door opening) 
 (man laughing) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 woman : Shh, shh, shh. 
 man : On y va. 
 (lovers laughing) 
 (clicking) 
 Wrong room. 
 No chance he remembered the layout wrong? 
 He didn't remember it wrong. 
 You said the codes room was second floor, second door to the left. 
 Yes, this is where it is... 
 It's not! 
 Your agent, maybe he has made a mistake. 
 My agent doesn't make mistakes. 
 I'm not playing this game. 
 You can try and beat another answer out of me if you want. Just because you keep me locked up doesn't mean I stop fighting for my country. 
 I swore an oath. 
 What would you do? 
 I respect that. But here's the thing. 
 I've got a man just outside of Hanover with a very special skill set, and we'd like to keep off the record. 
 He believes in fighting for his country too. 
 He tells me that Hanover's a nice place... and that Savenstrasse is a nice, quiet little street. 
 Good place to raise a family. 
 Two boys, a little girl, a wife. 
 You wouldn't. 
 What would you do? 
 Third floor, south wing, last room on the right. 
 Thank you. 
 (crying softly) 
 They started this war on a lie and they sustain it on lies. 
 You thought your husband was getting room and board and a job? 
 No. 
 18 hours a day on assembly lines. 
 No days off. 
 And brutally beaten when they slow down or complain... 
 Are you going to believe this salesman, this spy, huh? 
 And as a spy, I know which munitions factories were bombed, and the one in Sainte-Eugenie wasn't! 
 He lies! 
 We have a contact in Sainte-Eugenie. 
 He said a worker escaped, went to the Resistance to get help, to free the men. They had a plan. 
 Henri : Non. 
 But they got caught. 
 Non! 
 And one night, that man's barracks burned. 
 All the men inside were killed. Trapped. Begging. Screaming. 
 Non. Non, don't believe him! 
 I think you knew that. 
 I think you know there were no Allied bombs in Sainte-Eugenie. 
 This whole occupation, it would fall apart in a second if it wasn't for locals willing to do the dirty work in exchange for special favours like food, like supplies, like not getting sent to work camps... 
 Non. Non. 
 Non. 
 Are you going to take his word over mine, huh? I mean, I-I've been here for you every day. I-I bring you food, your-your winter coat. 
 What did you do in exchange for those extra supplies? What did you offer the Germans? 
 Nothing! I've just been a good citizen! 
 Good citizen who just happened to know of a neighbour in possession of illegal subversive literature. 
 The point is that I provide for you. 
 What did you do to him? 
 That-that I-I-I make you happy, that you are happy. 
 Henri, did you report Pierre to the police? 
 Non! Non! No, no. I... 
 You got him taken away?! 
 No! No! 
 He would have been taken anyway. It didn't make a difference Adele, ever since we first met, we both knew that you deserved better. 
 The only reason that I tolerate your attention is so that my boy doesn't go hungry! 
 Well, that makes you a whore! 
 (screaming and stabbing) 
 (screaming and stabbing) 
 You b*st*rd pig! You killed my father! 
 You're nothing! 
 (Louis yelling indistinctly) 
 (dramatic music playing) 
 (Tom cutting rope) 
 (woman moaning) 
 (wood creaking) 
 Was ist das? 
 woman : Easy on the hands! 
 (woman moaning) 
 soldier : Nous allons sur le quai. 
 Mademoiselle, come. 
 (door opening) 
 (Alfred gasps.) 
 (people chattering) 
 (beeping in Morse code) 
 "Third floor. South wing. 
 Last door on the right." 
 "South wing. 
 "Last on the... right. 
 Right." 
 Let's go. 
 (suspenseful music) 
 Non, non, non, non, non. 
 Why... why is the codes officer going back in? 
 (distant cheering outside) 
 Watch the door. 
 (people cheering outside) 
 (fireworks crackling) 
 (fireworks exploding) 
 Happy birthday, Adolf. 
 (fireworks) (people cheering) 
 (distorted sounds) 
 Ok, you're up. 
 Huh? 
 (discordant musical notes) 
 Alfred? 
 Alfred! (door closing) 
 Wir sind hier... Wir sind hier... 
 Ah! (grunting) 
 (Neil panting) 
 Sit down. 
 Look at me! Breathe! 
 Breathe! 
 (audible breathing) 
 Yeah? You're with me? 
 Ok, get this bloody job done. 
 Come on, Alfred, focus. 
 Focus. 
 The codes. 
 Just look at the codes. 
 That's it. 
 (Alfred flipping paper sheets) 
 Done? 
 About bloody time. 
 What the hell are we gonna do about this? 
 This was supposed to be a "no footprint" operation. 
 They'll know something's wrong He likes his drink. 
 It's Hitler's birthday. You want a drink. 
 Maybe a few. The fireworks are on. 
 You finish the bottle, lean out. Get a good look... 
 Open the window. 
 Help me. 
 (body impact on ground) 
 What do we do about this? 
 I know where everything was. 
 Louis. As soon as this man is gone, you are going to the police. 
 Not to report spies. 
 You tell them you caught Henri... trying to force himself on me. 
 And I called for help and you defended me. No one will blame you. 
 And there's nothing more to say about what happened here. 
 Um, I'm sorry this had to happen I want to go with you. 
 I know the area. 
 Every inch. I know their faces. 
 I can make them pay. 
 Adele : Louis, please. 
 It's not that simple. 
 Yes, it is. 
 I'll join the Resistance. 
 Tom : You're just a kid. 
 If you won't help me... 
 I'll fight on my own anyway. 
 I'll fight on my own. 
 The order was to kill them. 
 She said, "If there was another way." I saw another way. 
 You got lucky I got persuasive. 
 I got the boy onside and the mother's gonna keep quiet to protect him. We're supposed to recruit resistance right? 
 You got a kid to do your dirty work. 
 I did that family a favour. 
 That kid wanted to kill you. How'd you get him onside? 
 Told him about Sainte-Eugenie, how the Germans slaughtered all the men at his father's factory. 
 Is that true? 
 They didn't, all three, need to die. 
 What do you mean, "We can use them some of the time"? 
 It's not this simple, Harry. 
 I mean, now we know the time and place of every bombing run out of that airfield. Why can't we just make the calls, get the places evacuated? 
 And let the Germans know that we're reading their traffic? 
 Some raids will be intercepted. 
 Some? 
 I know what this means to you... but sometimes we have to stand back. 
 Let the bombs fall on people? 
 On families? 
 I mean, how can you just... 
 How can you just do that? 
 Probably changed the code keys when they found that guy's body anyway... And Alfred? 
 He... had some trouble, but, um, he did more than just memorize. 
 He showed initiative, potential. 
 He held his own. 
 He's still a hazard, but... as sergeant, I've been thinking and... we might consider expanding his training. 
 Sinclair : Integrating him? 
 Aurora : On a trial basis? 
 This was his trial. 
 So that's why you've been giving him all that "homework." 
 (knocking on door) 
 Come in. 
 Thank you. 
 (door closing) 
 Show him what's in that. 
 (repeated musical notes) 
 Know any other songs? 
 One phrase to remember, and I screwed it up. 
 I almost got Neil killed... 
 But you didn't. 
 What does it taste like? E flat major? 
 It's not the taste; it's the colours. 
 Shades of blue, and blue smells like home. 
 It smells like this one day, when I was 5, this one perfect day... 
 It makes you feel safe. 
 It makes my skin warm. 
 This morning at 2: 15 a.m., 300 ordinary Londoners thought they were participating in a drill. 
 A lucky... well-timed.. drill. 
 Because of you, 300 strangers get to see another sunrise. 
 300? 
 And 11. 
 We've been talking, and we'd like to know if, um, you'd want to join us again. 
 Think about it. 
 (repeated musical notes) 
 Yes.
