 Previously on  X Company. 
 What's your name? 
 Martin. 
 Let's take him with us. 
 He's just a kid. 
 Children know in their blood right from wrong, and no one pays attention to them. 
 Brandt's only in Paris for a couple of days; this is our chance to make an impact. 
 We have to kill him. 
 You're talking about going after a general. That kind of thing, it triggers reprisals. 
 Aufhalten! 
 (explosion) 
 (gunshot and screams) 
 You don't get to turn away! 
 (machine-gun fire) 
 You want to make the tough decisions? Then you have to know what it costs. 
 Please don't let them take me again. 
 I'm right here, my love. 
 (stabbing) 
 I love you. 
 (crying) 
 (exhaling) 
 (exhaling) 
 (indistinct chatter) We need to talk about Harry. 
 Once we finish setting up the camp. 
 Look, I know he broke ranks yesterday, but you were hard on him. 
 He's still just a... 
 He's been through a lot. 
 Alfred, Neal! 
 Everyone's been through a lot. 
 Good, you're back. Neal has some... 
 Guys, we need to move on Faber. You and I, we're heading into Paris. 
 Might want to hear this first. 
 Jacob was in town yesterday, supply run, local hotelier tells him there's a big Boche engineer coming in, refitting the local auto plant to make tanks for the Fuhrer. 
 After what happened yesterday, all those people, you want to hit another high-value German? 
 Don't be stupid, I'm... 
 Stupid? 
 No, uh... That's not that I meant. 
 George and Miri are scouting, to try to find a way to hit the factory. 
 Who sent them? 
 You were on watch. 
 So then, come and get me. 
 I updated Camp X on Terre-du-Fils. 
 All of it. 
 Good. 
 Now with that in mind, we're not gonna put any more civilians in harm's way, not again. 
 Attacking the auto plant could cripple their tank production. 
 And a raid like this would help George and his men train for what they'll need to do when the time comes. 
 Alright. 
 Neal and Tom will take the auto plant, but no civilian casualties. 
 Alfred, we need to get your eyes on the intelligence in Faber's safe. 
 Harry, the safe has the initials K.S. 
 Kirsch-Sekur. I know the model. 
 Good. 
 Show Alfred how to pick it. 
 What? No, I'll go with you. 
 Look, you're lucky to still be in this camp. 
 Now, everybody has their orders. 
 You leave within the hour. 
 (sigh) 
 S01E07 
La Vérité Vous Rendra Libre 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (Morse code beeping) 
 We need to do TV tests on the local POW camp in Beaumontville. 
 Jerry officers. 
 Certainly is a stroke of luck your CV came along when it did, Cameron. 
 Yes, uh, I wish I could be overseas, but, uh, bum ticker. 
 Your girl said the last man you had just up and disappeared last week. 
 Mmhmm. 
 One day, he's here; next day, pfff. 
 People go off, do crazy things. 
 You won't do anything crazy on me, will you, Cameron? 
 Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, sir. 
 The factory's 2km northeast. 
 I watched from the road. 
 She went to the gate with bread. She's a brazen one. 
 (Tom): How many guards inside? 
 Couldn't tell. 
 But they're making tanks so I'd wager more than a few. 
 So we need guns. Lots of guns. 
 What did I tell you? Brazen. 
 No, we can't. Right now, the locals are on our side. 
 If random civilians die in the crossfire, we lose that support. We need to find a better way. 
 It's a factory. If we sabotage the machines, it stops working. 
 If we get the engineer, we can find out where the factory's vulnerable. 
 Excuse me. 
 I have to get to a meeting. 
 Ugh! 
 Easy, easy. (German chocking) 
 (body falling on floor) 
 Nicely done. 
 Gunther Albrecht, nice to meet you. 
 We replace the engineer, target the machinery...  that's something that keeps the good guys safe. 
 (blond man): All right. We'll fill in Jacob and the others. 
 Relax, it'll work. 
 Men, can we have a word? 
 It's not that. It's Harry. 
 Someone needs to talk to him. In my experience, if you don't deal with this stuff, it deals with you. 
 Maybe you could, considering... 
 Considering what? 
 So young Harry's found his fire and fight; that something I'm supposed to feel sorry for? 
 Didn't think you'd sound so... 
 What? 
 Envious. 
 It must be nice. 
 What's that? 
 To be someone else for a while. 
 Lunching with a Nazi wife is not a vacation for me. 
 That's not what I meant. 
 Yesterday, the men at the church. 
 Red on white. 
 Just, it would be nice to be someone who doesn't remember quite so well, even for a little while. 
 I'm sorry. 
 When Faber came away from that church, his face covered in blood... 
 I remember when he was interrogating me, there was this moment when I knew that he lost someone. 
 Someone he cared about. 
 Someone who slipped away, right in his own hands. 
 He had the same look yesterday, like something was broken, and it would never be fixed. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 And to go from trucks to tanks has been a challenge, but by Wednesday my workers will be ready to do as many hours as you require. 
 Excellent. 
 And how many guards do we have? 
 We have 15 fully armed guards from the local SS detachment. Ah, one thing... we are replacing the test gauges in the automobile crank shafts, but should we calibrate for the Panzer shafts or the Renault FT? 
 They can discuss those details later. 
 My superiors are very happy with your cooperation. 
 France and Germany should be friends, always. 
 Just one thing. 
 You could not even answer a simple question about the crank shafts. You are no engineer. 
 What are you? Resistance? Looking to make trouble for me? 
 You don't think you're already in trouble? 
 A collaborator? 
 I'm a good ally and a businessman. 
 I'm also the man with the gun. 
 What do you have? 
 I have a message from the RAF. 
 On Wednesday, this factory will be bombed into oblivion unless we make a deal right now. 
 You can't! Half the town works here, it would be a massacre. 
 Welcome to the war. 
 Or you let us in to sabotage the machines tomorrow when the upgrades are complete. 
 I told you, there are guards. 
 Tell us exactly where guards will be stationed; my friends will take care of them too. 
 Or... shoot me, and no one will tell the bombers not to bomb your factory. 
 Or you. Or your workers. 
 You have one minute to decide. 
 Once Martin gives the all clear, Jacob, Miri,  and myself will go in with Harry's explosives. 
 We look for machines the owner's marked with two red chalk lines. Ten minutes and then it blows. Clear? 
 Our civilians could use another day or two of training first. 
 We don't have it to spare. This has to happen tomorrow; it's the only way to make sure the factory's empty. 
 (Martin): Shut up! What do you know? 
 (man): Martin, he's ingenious. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 I worry about that lad. I feel bad for him. 
 (Neil): Why? 
 Not everyone's cut out for this. 
 We'll brief the others first thing. Get some rest. 
 We'll be up at 0400. 
 What? You feel bad for Martin too? 
 Why would I? He has a chance to kill his enemies. 
 You must be a treat at parties. 
 (indistinct conversation) 
 (accordion music playing) 
 (sniffing) 
 Can this be real? 
 How did you...? 
 The manager has an arrangement. 
 This is a black market. 
 Sh. 
 The things you know about, Helene. 
 Go on. Take a piece. 
 (both laughing) 
 Franz hates when I do this, but it's just so much more... Forbidden? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Wait, let me get you a... 
 Um, do you have a handkerchief? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yah. 
 You should take a few back to Franz as a surprise. 
 Just, um... don't tell him where you got them. 
 I don't need an Oberfuhrer after me. 
 (both laughing) 
 Franz would never take it. 
 He's so... correct. 
 And lately, he's been... 
 It's been difficult to be honest. 
 What about a dinner out at least? 
 I just think, if the two of you had more time to talk, maybe it would be less difficult. 
 I wish I could... but we never go out. Or talk. 
 Do you think it's unhealthy to never talk about the things we've done? I mean, what we do. 
 I'm sorry. You need to work. 
 No, no, Sabine, wait. Um... 
 My number. 
 Maybe some night, when Franz is working, you and I could go out... together. 
 I don't know what I'd do without a friend like you, Helene. 
 Someone I can be honest with. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh. 
 Ha! 
 (indistinct talking) 
 Please. 
 Please, sir. Don't do this. Don't do this. 
 Please. 
 How you doing, Fritz? Eh? 
 Please, please, don't kill me. 
 Here, go on. 
 Doesn't matter anyway. 
 What are you doing? 
 I thought you were working on the explosives. 
 I am. 
 Is there a problem? 
 I don't know, Harry. Is there? 
 (Harry scoffs.) Hey, come here. 
 We need to talk. 
 Sticking that doctor, going over Aurora's head with Brandt, not to mention that stunt with the arsenic... what the hell is going on with you? 
 With me? 
 I'm fine. 
 People who say they're fine usually aren't. 
 Does that count for Neil too? 
 And Aurora? 
 They're not the ones I'm worried about. 
 Why not? 
 It doesn't bother you that Aurora's never here or that Neil brings a German military engineer into our secret camp and is planning to let him go rather than kill him? 
 And I'm the one you're worried about. 
 He's right. Right now, we kill one German, and they kill ten civilians. 
 Or have you already forgotten about yesterday? 
 Doesn't even matter. 
 He's already dead. 
 No, Harry. 
 After the raid, when we move camp, we cut him loose. 
 It's not what I meant. 
 (both chuckling) 
 I know you have bad nights. 
 If you feel bad, I'd like it if you told me. 
 You know what I like? 
 Some things you don't talk about, some things I don't; that's what makes us work together, no? 
 (small chuckle) 
 Come here. 
 There'll be another time when the apartment's empty. 
 She's home all day and night. 
 He comes and goes. They never go out. 
 We could be waiting for weeks. 
 Then, we cut our losses, head back to camp, help with this raid like a team again. 
 Since when were we not a team? 
 Who else feels this way? 
 Nobody has said anything. 
 Because they don't have to. 
 This team doesn't exist without you. 
 Pfff! 
 Is that a compliment or a warning? 
 You know, everything I do right now, everything I've been doing... feels like I've been running, and there hasn't been any time to just stop and... 
 (sigh) Just ever since that night... 
 Running from what? 
 What night? 
 In Sainte Lynette, when, um... when René... when he died... I, um... I... 
 (phone ringing) 
 Wait. What were you gonna say? 
 
 
 
 Hello? 
 woman : Helene? I didn't think you'd be home. 
 Sabine? 
 I'm ready to talk to you. 
 What's wrong? 
 I can't talk here. 
 Can you meet me? 
 Yes. 
 Église du Précieux Sang. 
 Église du Précieux Sang? 
 Yes, of course, of course. I can find it, yes. 
 Come right now. 
 I will. I will be there. 
 Thank you, Helene. 
 Goodbye. 
 Église du Précieux Sang; where is it? 
 27, rue de la Montagne. 
 Why does she have the phone number of our safe house? 
 I took a risk, and it paid off. 
 She wants to talk. Faber's out. The place is empty. 
 You'll go in on your own. 
 This wasn't the plan. 
 Plan's changed. You have the key. I'll keep her there at the church. 
 Order the flowers. 
 Are you too close to her? 
 What? 
 Are you too close to Sabine? 
 Alfred, this is my job, and this is our one chance. I'm gonna take it. 
 I'll see you back here when we're done. 
 (door opening and closing) 
 (crickets chirping) 
 (Neil sighing) 
 What is it? 
 It's nothing, go back to sleep. 
 That thing we don't talk about? 
 It's always the same. 
 It's me and this... German radio operator. 
 His name was Rolf. 
 We were in a basement, and I had to kill him. 
 I have my knife. He sa... 
 He says to me every night, "It's cruel to make me wait." 
 So I do it. 
 And ever since... I wonder... will I have to do it again... who will I have to kill this time? 
 I was a copper. 
 I looked out for people. 
 Now I'm just a weapon. 
 It scares me what I've turned into. 
 It scares the hell out of me. 
 (sniffling and exhaling) 
 Just saying it out loud... it's a relief, you know? 
 Miri, what? 
 Miri, wait. 
 Hold on a minute. I told you something. 
 Why? 
 Why would you tell me about killing some Nazi in a basement? 
 You asked. I thought you'd understand. 
 You want to know what I dream about, what I remember? 
 I was coming back from the river where I washed our clothes. 
 The Nazis had already killed half our children. 
 When they found me, they made me watch the rest. 
 Miri, we can talk about this. Let's go... 
 My baby brother, they smashed against the stones of a well. 
 They took my parents with the old people, and they put them in a caravan and set it on fire. 
 I remember the smell. They didn't even try to stop me when I ran. 
 Who would I tell? 
 Who would care about some dirty gypsies? 
 No. Don't say that... 
 So no! 
 I don't "understand" being afraid to kill those people. 
 I don't understand anyone who is. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 For Sabine Faber from Oberfuhrer Franz Faber. 
 She's out. 
 Just give them to me, I will take them up myself. 
 (door creaking) 
 Martin, what are you doing out here? 
 You're not on watch yet. 
 I can't do this. 
 I'm not like you. I'm not a soldier. 
 And tomorrow... 
 Tomorrow, you're just on lookout. 
 The Germans are still looking for me after you and Miri killed those guards. 
 What if I get caught? 
 They'll kill me. 
 I'm scared, Neil. I'm scared. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (Martin sobbing softly) 
 Go on. 
 As far away as you can. 
 Before anyone else sees, go on. 
 Thank you. Thank you, Neil. 
 It's alright. 
 (sigh) 
 You're such a good friend. 
 I don't want to lose you. 
 You won't. 
 You don't have to say anything. 
 But you don't know what I did... what we've done. 
 You mean you and Franz? 
 Something no one else knows. 
 You know, we had a son. His name was Ulli. He was... different. 
 Different how? 
 "Weak. Unworthy. A burden to the Reich." 
 Every feeling he had was special. 
 Every moment was special. 
 To him and to us. 
 But after he was born, there was a decree... to keep Germany pure. 
 So they took him? 
 No. 
 We came here to be away from Berlin, to keep him safe. 
 Someone found out. 
 They wanted to take him to a special institution where... Franz said they would do... things to him, experiments, and then kill him. 
 So when Franz came home, we made a choice. 
 And our boy never knew that anything was wrong. 
 Sabine? 
 Sabine? 
 Franz  gave him a cup of milk with a little powder to help him sleep. 
 He was always so gentle with him. 
 And I kissed him goodnight. 
 And Franz took the pillow because I couldn't. 
 How could a mother do that... to her own son? How... how could we? 
 And nobody knows? 
 It's like he was never there. 
 (door creaking) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (Sabine sobbing) 
 (crickets chirping) 
 (faint rustling) 
 Intruders! 
 (indistinct shouting, gunshots) Miri! 
 Miri! 
 (machine-gun fire) 
 Miri! 
 Get down! 
 (machine-gun fire) 
 Uh-huh. 
 Hello. 
 Who would like to come with us to Paris? 
 Please. 
 I have something to say. 
 (Neil): Jacob. 
 (Nazi speaking German) 
 (Jacob spits.) 
 (Nazi laughing) 
 And so... who's next? 
 You? 
 You? 
 Come! First one to ask. 
 Good. 
 (gunshot) 
 (second gunshot) Ugh! 
 (three stabs) 
 They shot up your tent. 
 I was in the woods. I saw them coming. 
 Right before they attacked, she charged them. 
 It's the only reason we heard. Brazen, thank Christ. 
 There's another. 
 Not anymore. 
 How did this happen? We just moved camp, how did they know? 
 Factory owner? 
 How would he know where we were? 
 It was Martin. 
 I caught him trying to sneak away, and I let him go. 
 Why? 
 He said he was scared. 
 Let's just bury our dead. 
 (Selene): You must think I'm a monster. 
 (Aurora): You're not a monster. 
 Doing that to our own son... 
 This was a mistake. I shouldn't have told you. 
 No, no. Sabine, I know what it feels like. 
 I do. 
 Because I did the same thing. 
 I told you about my husband, Max? 
 He was... he was strong, very strong, but, um... he got sick. 
 He got weak. 
 So weak that there was nothing left of him. 
 And he begged me... to help him. 
 And so I did. 
 With my own hands. 
 So I know, Sabine. 
 You gave him mercy. 
 I don't know if it was right. 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know who to tell. 
 I don't know where to put it. 
 All I know is that... he's gone. 
 (Aurora sobbing softly) 
 (exhaling) 
 I'm sorry. 
 (exhaling) 
 We should go for a walk. 
 Yes. 
 (touching music) 
 (Harry): Just saying... 
 (Tom): Leave it, Harry. 
 He knows our movements, our routines, so even if she finds him, there's no reason... 
 What's done is done! 
 When Aurora gets back, I'll tell her it's on me. 
 If that means a discharge, I'll take it. 
 It's not... done. 
 Word will get around... how vulnerable the Resistance is. 
 Other rats will try to get in, sell us out... unless someone pays. 
 Please, no! 
 I went back to Vareges. 
 Talked to the boys who knew him. They said he was getting on a train. 
 Please, please. 
 Please, you don't understand. 
 He had this too. 
 He's rich. 
 This is... I saved this! I stole it! It's mine! 
 I'll finish this. 
 No. 
 I felt sorry for you. 
 You lied to me. To all of us. 
 This is your fault! 
 Yeah, because I let you go. 
 I was just playing football, and you killed those Germans! 
 We saved you! 
 They were after me ever since! 
 I didn't lie! I didn't lie. 
 I was scared. I was scared that they would find me! 
 Scared? You were scared, eh? 
 Eh? What about Jacob?! Do you think he was scared? Eh? 
 Do you think they were scared when they were murdered in their sleep because of you?! 
 Were they gonna save me? Huh? 
 Were you? 
 I knew that if I went to the Germans... and told them about the raid and the camp, they'd listen to me and let me live! 
 That's all I wanted. 
 Please don't... 
 Neil. 
 Give it to me. Just give it to me, will ya?! 
 Hey! Hey! He was dead already! 
 OK? They all were. 
 The engineer, Jacob... everybody in this war is already dead. 
 All of us. 
 Once you know that, you don't have to be afraid. 
 (birds singing) 
 Do you think Franz is worried? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't care. 
 Last night I told him I wanted to go to the sea. 
 To say goodbye to Ulli. 
 He couldn't even do that. 
 I think maybe I just want to run away. 
 Hmm... 
 How much money do you have? 
 (distant phone ringing) 
 (door closing) 
 Sabine! 
 Sabine! 
 What happened? 
 Why are you here? What about the raid on the factory? 
 There is no raid. 
 There's no camp anymore either. 
 George, Conrad, and Miri are waiting for word. 
 They're the only survivors. 
 Survivors? 
 Oh my God, did Faber know about that too? 
 What do you mean, "too"? 
 Faber knows about Camp X, about HYDRA, about Sinclair. 
 He has maps, photos. 
 He's planning an attack sometime in the next 24 hours. 
 How do they know? 
 We have to radio Sinclair! 
 Radio's destroyed. 
 Then we have to fix it! 
 Where's Aurora? 
 The last time I saw her was at a church, with Faber's wife. 
 They left together. 
 I haven't heard from her since. 
 (small sigh) 
 Here we are! 
 Here we are. Haha! 
 (train whistle)
