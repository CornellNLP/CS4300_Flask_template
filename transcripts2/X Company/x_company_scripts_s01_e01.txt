 (Woman laughing) 
 (Machine gun fire) 
 Ugh! 
 Woman :Let me go! 
 Forget my name. 
 Everybody, go, go, go, go! 
 S01E01 
Pilot 
 (People chattering) 
 (Insects buzzing) 
 (Brushing sounds) 
 (Dog barking) 
 (Honking) 
 Lucie! 
 (Whispering) 
 Come on, Harry! 
 Anything? 
 Higher! 
 Again? 
 Yeah. 
 Higher. 
 Tom Cummings, cause of death: Harry. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 There it is! don't move it! 
 You got a response? 
 Hang on, hang on. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 Where is he? 
 Office. British house call with Mayhew. 
 You have to take a look at this. 
 He's the real deal. 
 Vaudeville? Ha ha! This? 
 George, we are hanging on by our fingernails. 
 Now, it's time to get creative and look beyond Oxford and Cambridge. We need people like him. 
 Failed basic training. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Yes, it bloody does! 
 Referred to a psychiatric unit? 
 So he saw a psychiatrist. 
 I don't care if he... 
 No, I'm sorry, Sinclair... we are out of time! And frankly, it is this kind of backwards thinking that loses wars. 
 May I remind you who funds this camp? 
 May I remind you who runs it? 
 Sir? 
 Yes. 
 It's Harry. 
 Emergency frequency. 
 What's going on? 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 He's transmitting single digit? 
 He wouldn't take the risk if he had a choice. 
 They arrived safely last night, but when Rene met with Leo, the gestapo was waiting. Leo was interrogated and hanged. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 Harry : Come on! Come on! 
 Ok! Go! 
 Tell them I evaded capture, shot SS officer. Considered compromised. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 Woman : "Rene evaded capture. Shot SS officer. Considered compromised." 
 Dammit. 
 Rene :Our inside source is uncompromised. 
 (Man talking in German) 
 That means Leo didn't talk, otherwise they'd know the housekeeper was his wife and that she understands German. Thank you, Leo. 
 (Machine beeping) (Tom grunting) 
 This morning, Richter told Major Kiefer he wants reprisals as a warning not to help the resistance. 
 He plans to massacre the entire village. 
 Women and children will not be spared. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 No, no. Come, please. 
 Come! 
 German : Hey, stop! 
 Beautiful work. 
 Who is the artist? 
 (Birds singing) 
 (Indistinct whispering) 
 You, down. 
 Come here! 
 Down. 
 Down! 
 Ten seconds to tell me who did this. 
 Nine. 
 Eight. 
 Seven. 
 Six. 
 Five. 
 Please, I don't know. 
 Four. 
 No. 
 Three. 
 Two. 
 Me! It's me! 
 Leave him alone! 
 Annie! 
 Where did your girl learn the symbol of the resistance? 
 I'm sorry. 
 She likes pranks and she's stupid. She does not think. 
 This won't happen again. 
 I teach her a lesson she won't forget. 
 Non! 
 I know what she needs. 
 And everyone here can watch and learn. 
 No, sir. Please. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 Rene :Victor will give the order to strike at 1500. 
 How about we cut to the punchline? 
 Direction-finding van. 
 They're on us, shut it down! 
 No. If we don't get clearance, this village is as good as dead. 
 We don't wait for clearance. We go ahead without it That's not your call to make. 
 We don't need to play "mother, may I?" Every time we bloody blow our nose! 
 We do this, the Germans know we're here. 
 It changes the game for every network in the area. 
 Keep going, Harry. Request clearance to strike first. (Beeping) 
 (High-pitched signal) 
 (Beeping) 
 There. 
 Good. 
 Now... Heil Hitler. 
 Annie, show some respect. 
 Do as you're told right now! 
 Come on. Higher, higher. 
 Keep going. 
 (Annie weeping softly) 
 Heil Hitler... 
 Heil Hitler. 
 There. Was that so hard? 
 Lunch? 
 Right away, sir. 
 Sorry. 
 If you lower your arm, we will shoot you. 
 Ja. 
 (Acoustic signal) 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 We bomb Richter and the major at lunch, draw the platoon to the bridge. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 They want to blow the bridge. 
 Rene :We eliminate the platoon, we eliminate Richter. 
 They save the town. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 (Dramatic music) 
 (Acoustic signal) 
 Out of time. They're here. 
 Woman : Neil, ring the bell. 
 We've got to slow them down. 
 (Bell ringing) 
 (Bell ringing) 
 (Shouting) Out of the way! 
 We've got to move! 
 Not until we get the green light! 
 (Bell ringing) 
 I'm sorry. I don't speak german. 
 Raus. 
 We're there to stir up the French, recruit resistance, so that when we hit the beach, they stand up and fight. 
 What are you saying? 
 Maybe we let Richter have his way. 
 A massacre like that, wouldn't you stand up and fight? 
 Or we show them that the Germans aren't above a kick in the ass. 
 Green light. Kate. 
 I'll go get a bird to get 'em out. 
 (Beeping in morse code) 
 (Bell still ringing) 
 Green light! Green light! 
 Rene : Tom! 
 Woman : Come on, Harry! 
 Tom : Come on! 
 Harry : Tom! 
 Tom! 
 Pass it up! 
 Pass it up! I got it, go! 
 Ok. (Bell ringing) 
 Green light, let's go! 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Neil : Out the back, there's an alley! 
 I'll hide here. You can't be seen with me, go! 
 I'm right behind you. 
 Go! Go! 
 Aurora, listen to me. 
 Squeeze here, pull the pin I was in that class with you. 
 Once you've released the pressure switch, you've got... 
 10 seconds to toss it and get out of range. 
 Stay out of sight. Meet you on the bridge. 
 Go, go, go, go! 
 Going. 
 (Banging on door) 
 Do you remember when you signed the official secrets act? 
 "Be it enacted by the king's most excellent majesty by and with the consent of the commons in this present." 
 And I said maybe we'd get you a desk and you'd work in cryptography? 
 Yes. 
 I may have lied. 
 (Banging on door) 
 (Banging on door) 
 Nazi : Open the door! 
 Come on! 
 No! No weapons in my church! 
 Who else is here? 
 Only the faithful. 
 (Indistinct talking) 
 Who are you? 
 I asked you. Who are you? 
 My name is Marie-Rosese Tavernier. 
 You're not from here? 
 No, I'm from Beaune. 
 What's going on? 
 You come with us. 
 Good. You will save me a lot of work. 
 I came to help my cousin in the sturmbannfuhrer's kitchen. 
 I'm happy I won't be the one who has to say why his lunch is late. 
 Fine. Go. 
 No. You come to the station for them... after the sturmbannfuhrer's lunch. 
 "Unable to complete obstacle courses." 
 "Panic reaction upon discharge of weapons. Private Graves is prone to trembling, hyperventilating, and apparent hallucinations." 
 Read Dr. Bennett's notes. 
 Alfred has exceptional intelligence. 
 He's got a condition that's been identified as synesthesia. 
 Synesthesia? 
 The brain is cross-wired. 
 One sense is actually fused to another. 
 Yes. I fail to see how this helps make an agent of him. 
 George, you have colleagues at Bletchley who make him look normal. 
 Sinclair... 
 I need him. 
 One mission. 
 Why did you enlist? 
 I want to serve... 
 Do my part. 
 He read the recruitment posters. 
 People are dying and I'm home doing nothing. 
 Apart from a Vaudeville show. 
 Oh, you think that's what I want to do? 
 Alright, let me make it simple. 
 If we lose the war, the last defense of democracy will be fought by you, underground, for as long as the enemy is in power. 
 You don't want to do that on a whim. 
 It's not a whim. 
 Do you have the slightest idea what we do here? 
 No, he doesn't, not yet. 
 No. I'm sorry, Duncan, this won't do. 
 I think I do know what you do here. I saw through the windows. 
 Demilitarized zone. Vichy. Undercover. Active. 
 You have networks in Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, North Africa, and France. 
 Where there are cells. I don't know what that means. 
 Armee secrete, 6 members. Groupe du muse de I'homme, 8. 
 Volontaires de la liberte, 11. Weather charts. 
 Tide charts. You're monitoring the moon phase for a Norway drop. 
 Next full moon is Saturday, April 30th. 
 Dit-da, di-dit. Di-dit. Dit-da-dit-dit. Dit-dit-dit. 
 Di-dat, dit-dit. Dit-dit dit-dit dit-dit da... A, I, R, L. Airlift. 
 Villemarie. 
 Priority. 
 (Indistinct whispering) 
 What's happening in Villemarie? 
 (Birds singing) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Sehen Sie was? 
 Hier ist niemand. 
 Moment. Schauen Sie mal hier. 
 Ich war mir sicher, dass das von diesem Turm kam. 
 (Man speaking German) 
 (Conversation in German) 
 (Door closing) 
 (Annie gasping) 
 I have a little girl. 
 Her name's Frieda. 
 She likes pranks too, to make people "surprise" and laugh, just like you. 
 I see you here in the house and the garden. 
 I always think of Frieda. 
 And "how's" your name? 
 Annie. 
 Annie. 
 Happy to learn to know you. 
 Happy to learn to know you. 
 
 
 
 (Crow cawing) 
 We don't have much time. 
 Hey, boys, need a hand? 
 No, we're pretty much finished. 
 Long way from chemistry class, huh? 
 How many guys you think will be on the bridge? 
 What's the reason for asking? 
 I mean, they're someone's brothers, you know? 
 Fathers even? 
 Yeah. 
 40,000 killed in London last September. 
 Jenny Patterson, she lived across from us, she was 24. 
 They found her crushed under 2 stories of rubble, with her 3-month old in her arms. 
 He survived by nursing his dead mother. 
 These "fathers," these "brothers," they elected the b*st*rd who started this. 
 They love him. They're gonna slaughter our village for him. So bloody well keep that in mind while you do the bloody job you trained for. 
 I'll do the north sentry first. 
 You walk onto the bridge. 
 He'll ask you for papers, you don't stop. 
 Ok? He'll follow you. I come up the side, take him from behind. 
 You keep going. Take out the south sentry. 
 Alright? 
 Yeah. 
 Harry? 
 Yeah, yeah. Um, I got the easy job, right? 
 What's the matter? Never blown up a bridge before? 
 Yeah, well, maybe in advertising, cutting throats is easy. 
 Oh, the bastards! 
 Shhh... 
 They think I don't understand. Saying it right under my nose... 
 My husband hanging outside... 
 Shh... 
 My daughter! 
 I want to see his face, look him right in the eyes when he knows it's coming. It's almost over. 
 Excuse me. 
 I let her go. (Sigh of relief) 
 I really must want to study medicine, you know? 
 (Steps moving away) 
 But I-I... I cannot go to the university if first, I don't join the military, so... 
 Whispering : Yeah... 
 (Steps moving away) 
 (Sighing) 
 Hey! Papiere! 
 Wo gehst du hin? Hey. Papiere! 
 (Soldier groaning) 
 (Breathing nervously) 
 (Groaning) 
 (Soldier choking) 
 (Tom hyperventilating) 
 (Soldier breathing weakly) 
 (Groaning) 
 Bloody hell! 
 (Opera playing) 
 Good. 
 Jose, cognac. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Geez! 
 (Gasping) 
 We're the only spy-training facility in North America. 
 We train assassins, codebreakers, saboteurs. 
 We specialize in unconventional warfare, which is why we need unconventional warriors like you. 
 (Gunshots) 
 It's live fire, Alfred. You get used to it. 
 It's not just the noise for you, is it? 
 What is it? Is it smell? Taste? What? Tell me. 
 You said I'd be working with codes, behind a desk. 
 We could do that. 
 But here's the thing: I need that memory of yours for a very special operation. 
 First, you're going to need some training. 
 A special operation? 
 In France. 
 (Motorcycle revving up) 
 This is Hydra. 
 It's a state-of-the-art signals station. 
 We're the communications center of North America. 
 We relay radio traffic from South America, Europe, and Washington. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Anything? 
 Alfred, this is Krystina. 
 Our first team is in the field right now. 
 Rene is the leader. 
 Canadian journalist in Paris when the Germans rolled in. 
 He took the fight underground. 
 That's Harry. Three months ago, Harry's biggest concern was getting home to his parents before curfew. Harry's an improviser, engineer. 
 He loves explosives, gadget design, and he transmits morse code at 51 words a minute. 
 That's Tom. 
 He was the first American through the gate. 
 The U.S. is just joining the war but they have no foreign intelligence, no training schools, no spies, so Roosevelt came to us. Tom's an ad man. 
 He specializes in propaganda and deception. 
 Neil was as a copper in London and Shanghai. 
 His entire family was wiped out in the blitz. 
 He hates the Germans. 
 Aurora, French Canadian fluent in German. 
 She's worked with the resistance since the beginning of the war. 
 None of us imagined we'd be here, Alfred. 
 No one's born knowing what they can do. 
 That's it. 
 I'll blow it from underneath the bridge. 
 (Men laughing) 
 It's time. 
 I'll release it quietly under the table, then I'll run out before they wonder why. 
 Richter : Jose! 
 It's coming, sir! 
 I'll get it. Now, go get your coat and run. 
 Thank you. 
 Go. 
 Where are you going? 
 What are you doing? 
 Jose? 
 My cousin was feeling faint, I was just letting in some air. 
 Why is there a coffee pot on the floor? 
 I am sorry, sir. I, uh... 
 I will bring it to the kitchen in a moment. 
 Jose! 
 Go. 
 No, Jose. 
 What's going on? 
 No, you can't. 
 I'll take care of everything. 
 This was not the plan. 
 It's too late. 
 It is the only way. 
 Richter : Jose. 
 Tell Annie I love her. 
 This is for Leo. 
 Runter, runter, runter, runter. 
 (Men speaking German) 
 Maman! 
 Maman! Maman! 
 (Piano music playing) 
 Maman! Maman! 
 Maman? 
 Maman. Maman. 
 Maman. Maman. 
 Maman. Maman. 
 Maman. 
 (Annie weeping) Maman. 
 Maman. 
 Ma... man. 
 Jose's dead. 
 I can hear them. Here they come. 
 (He sighs.) 
 (Tires squealing) 
 Heil Hitler! 
 Harry... 
 This is all yours. 
 What? No! 
 Also los. 
 Kommt, kommt, wir gehen. 
 Was? 
 We're losing them, come on! 
 Harry... Harry. 
 Ah, come on! 
 You killed ma maman! 
 You killed her! 
 She's dead! 
 It's Annie! 
 Stop! 
 Why did you kill her? 
 Aurora : Stop! 
 Annie : I hate you! 
 Why?! 
 We won't get this chance again. 
 She's dead!Ma maman! Ma maman!You killed maman! 
 You killed maman! 
 This isn't personal, this is what we have to do. 
 You killed maman! 
 Annie : Stop! Stop! 
 Annie! Hey, come with me. 
 Ma maman! You killed maman! 
 Annie : Non. Maman. Non! 
 Stefan : Shh! Come, Annie. 
 Annie :Ma maman, you killed her! 
 No! No... 
 Come with me. 
 Annie : Maman! 
 German : Let us through! 
 What the hell! 
 He's gonna get the girl. 
 Annie : You killed maman! 
 Neil : Ich nehme sie. 
 : 
 Kannst gehen. 
 (Annie screaming) 
 Dammit! Dammit! I'm going up there. 
 Stop. 
 Hey, Mann. Sie ist doch nur ein Mädchen. Hör auf damit. 
 Hey. 
 Ugh! 
 Halt! 
 Runter. 
 Runter von der Bruecke. 
 Runter von der Bruecke. 
 Runter von der Bruecke. 
 Aurora : No! 
 Runter von der Bruecke. 
 Vorwaerts. 
 Harry, blow it! 
 Achtung! (Gunshots) 
 Ah! 
 (Gunshots) 
 Bewegt euch. 
 Halt. Stehen bleiben. 
 Do it! Now! 
 Do it! 
 No. 
 (Gunshots) 
 Now! 
 Just wait. 
 (Gunshots) 
 Sinclair :I won't lie to you. Survival rate in the field is 50%. 
 And the truth is we are losing this fight. 
 We are up against a ruthless, relentless enemy... 
 You've seen what happens to me. There's got to be others. 
 No one can do what you do. 
 I live in a room where it's quiet. I stay away from busy streets. 
 It takes me all morning to get the guts to go out for groceries. 
 Then why did you enlist? 
 I was tired of hiding. 
 I thought maybe I had one fight in me. 
 You're afraid. 
 Alfred, my back is against the wall. 
 I get reports. 
 A thousand families murdered in the middle of the night. 
 Boatfuls of boys, young women trying to patch them up. 
 I have one dead son. 
 The other boy's in the mediterranean and it rips my guts out every time I have to ask someone else to do this. 
 But I am afraid of what happens if I don't. 
 (Beautiful melancholy music) 
 Give me a chance. 
 One mission. 
 Please. 
 We should not loose sight of the fact that our armed forces are engaged on other battlefronts all over the world, and that no one front can be considered alone without its proper relation to war. 
 We are on the offensive all over the world. 
 Bringing the attack to our enemies. 
 In the pacific by relentless submarine and naval attacks, amphibious thrusts, ever-mounting air attacks, we have deprived the japs... 
 (Inaudible talking) 
 (Inaudible talking) 
 (Women typing) 
 (Indistinct talking) 
 Villemarie. Villemarie. Bois de Charel. Bois de Charel. 
 High tide. High tide. Current, 9 knots. 
 15-foot beach. High tide. 
 9 knots. 15-foot depth. Sunrise. 
 Proxigean sunrise. Sunset. 6:12, sunrise. Sunset. 
 The bridge when it blew up, it was 2 days away from the proxigean spring tide. 
 The what? 
 Every year and a half, combination of new moon and the proxigee. 
 It's when the moon's at its closest, so the tide's at its highest. 
 He jumped from the middle of the bridge? 
 Yeah, yeah, near it. 
 Factor the height of the bridge; Ebbing tide; depth, 15 feet; currents, 9 knots; He'd be swept away. 
 There's a bend downriver, he'd have cover. 
 There's a chance he'd survive. 
 Aurora, gentlemen... 
 This is Alfred.
