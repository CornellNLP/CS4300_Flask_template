 Previously on "X Company"... 
 I'm sorry, do I know you? 
 I suppose you do now. 
 Heidi Adler. 
 Helene Bauer. 
 I'm a friend of the Fabers. So nice to meet you. 
 Aurora, his feelings for you make you all vulnerable. End it. That kiss, it was a mistake. Is this Sinclair talking? No. Believe me. I'm overseeing a special project in Poland. I need a man with exceptional skill to pacify the area. Your transfer has already been approved. If Faber's posted alongside his father-in-law, it puts him in a better position to learn where the refineries are. That's why you're going there too. I'll reach out to my old friend at the Ministry of Transport. I have your word that Klaus is all right? Ernst, your son died in the line of duty. And you come here asking me for favours?! What kind of man does that? How did things go with your contact? We need to find another way. Maybe Poland can be a new beginning. And we get away from them. Our obligations  to each other are now over. Not necessarily. Sabine :  Did I tell my father about the spies who pretend to be my friends? Not yet. You will help us in Poland. S03E04 Promises Sabine? (door creaking and closing) Sabine? Good morning! Where were you? I was hoping to be back before you were up. I thought we should enjoy Madame Le Guennec's croissants on our last day. Made with butter. God knows how. Well, I'm going to get the dishes. Who needs plates? (Sabine chuckling) If my father could see us now. Mmm! What is it? Something I need to tell you. All right. The Allied spies, they're travelling to Poland too. Aurora will join us on the train as Helene Bauer. Why? You said yourself, this is a chance for us to start over. Those people bring us nothing but trouble. My hands are tied. Go back and tell them no. Sabine, I can't. Yes, you can. I can't. It's to protect you. How does it protect me? They recorded a conversation you had with Aurora. What?! You told her we knew about them, that we let them into our home. Oh, God. That I had agreed to help them. And now they can use this against us at any time, force us do whatever they want. You had no way of knowing they would do this. For now, we must cooperate. (beeping in Morse code) Can we trust him? He's never been predictable. Worth the risk. If the Nazis get their hands on that much oil, the war's over. How did the Americans respond? Butler wants our intel on Marigold ASAP. Course he does. He wants to know how we got eyes and ears into Poland. So you told him all he has to do is turn a high-ranking SS officer? I did not. And Colonel Mayhew? He thinks it's terrific. He's been pushing for an attack on oil since '39. It's good to have you back, sir. It's good to be back. It's been a busy week. Where are we with papers for Neil and Harry? Harry dropped off the photographs. Papers will be ready in a few hours. Good. Faber's agent, we fed him the false intel as you asked. We're questioning the local Fascists he was working with. And I heard you took care of the man yourself. Yes, sir. Good. Sir, I'd like to renew my request for field training. I'll consider it once I've caught up. Thank you, Krystina. Your successor seems eager to maintain your high standards. What do you mean? This morning, Oberfuhrer Fischer ordered the mass arrests of Resistance members. He said they must pay for the hijacking of the Fuhrer's broadcast. Idiot. Herr Brigadefuhrer? He wants to look good to the powers in Berlin. But now the Resistance will be twice as cautious and go deeper underground, and a more cautious enemy is harder to catch. "A more cautious enemy is harder to catch." What are you doing? Memorizing. I keep a journal. Oh, no, no. I am definitely more Humphrey Bogart than what's-his-chops. His name is Joseph Cotten. I am telling you: OK, you feel like a Bogart but in that photo, you look exactly like Cotten. What do you mean, I "feel" like Humphrey Bogart? It doesn't even matter. Just forget about it. Then why did you say it then? Well, I'm sorry I did. I don't like using a forger I haven't personally vetted, Resistance or not. Well, we're running low on options. You're telling me Faber can't pull a few strings to get us papers? What use is he then? You don't trust Faber? Course, I bloody don't. Well, Sinclair seems to. Yeah, nobody's perfect. Look at us out here trying to scrounge a way to get... (man speaking German) (ominous music) Is that our guy? Yeah, it's him. Let's get back to the safe house. Yeah. Get ourselves out of Paris. Gestapo have our photos now. He's late. He'll be here. He will. We're selling Faber on the idea that we're on the same side. We had to use the recording; it was the only way to ensure his cooperation. You once told me blackmail was not a long-term plan. It was for the security of the team. We had no choice. We sacrifice a lot of things for the security of the team. This couldn't wait? We apologize, but the circumstances are serious. Our contact was arrested by the Gestapo. He was making papers for Neil and Harry. My successor wants to make a statement. It's out of my hands. We need German papers for them. Papers take time. I'm leaving for Poland today. The forger had Neil and Harry's photographs. Then, they need to disappear. Tomorrow, their faces will be on posters across the city. That's why we need them on a train today. Can they come with us, as our guests? No. "Helene Bauer" is our guest because you have German papers. According to your cover, you should be in Norway. As for the other two? You could be travelling with the Fuhrer himself, you'd still need papers to cross into Germany. So how can we get them to Poland? It's not my problem. Please, don't make us make it your problem. There is one way to cross those borders without papers. We're listening. (indistinct chatter) Move it. Continue. Continue. Move. Move. It stops at a town called Pomoc. He'll be waiting on the platform to take us off the train. Course he will. (indistinct chatter) It's OK. Move! Come on. Thanks. German woman : Anything other than this? German waiter : We have coffee or tea. man on PA :  Next stop, Epernay. Epernay, next stop. Good afternoon. woman : Will you bring me some more sugar, please? Sabine... Do you honestly believe I'll talk to you after what you did? I'm sorry. I wouldn't have done it unless it was absolutely necessary. Oh, spare me. (whispering): It's critical you play along, Sabine. (disquieting music) man : Keep it away. man : We'll be alright. woman : It is bloody gone? (chugging noise) (train whistle) Come on, sit down! Everybody, sit down! (indistinct chatter) SIT DOWN! Are you kidding me? Prisoners get special treatment if they agree to help. Unbelievable. How did you know that? Drabek. Neil : Bloody hell! (train whistle blowing) (inaudible talking) (Harry): You were living in the Marais? We hid in our apartments during the round-ups, but the Germans found us a few days later. How? Our neighbours. People we used to have dinner with. As they took us away, I asked him, "Why?" You know what he said? "Because you are a Jew." (clanking) I want to ensure we have a smooth trip, and this will only happen if we all behave. Is that clear? Where are we going? Who put you in charge? We're going to a work camp, and the Germans put me in charge. (indistinct whispering) No more talking. What kind of work? (whispering): I don't know, Ben. (clinking) waiter : Here you go. Thank you. Ma'am. (train whistle) There's one thing I've been meaning to tell you, and I promise you it's the truth. When you say that, I know you're about to lie to me. Please. Do you know how exhausting it is to be lied to all the time? It goes both ways. I've spent days where it felt like I never spoke a single true word. By the end of those days, I feel like there's nothing left of me. I was ready to hate you for so many reasons, but then I met you, and I couldn't. There were lots of times when our friendship was real, when I told you things that I hadn't told a living soul because I knew... I knew that you'd understand. May I join you? Please sit. I had no idea you were coming with us, Helene. (chuckling): Yes, well, uh, here I am. Yes, I was just thanking Sabine for inviting me along. I thought she'd appreciate having a familiar face around while she settles in. You travelled all this way to help your friend settle in? That's very kind of you. Helene is always up for adventure. Is that so? Marvellous! I'm glad the museum were willing to give you time off. Well, they didn't really have a choice. I quit this morning. You do like adventure. You know I told you about my boss yesterday? Uh-huh. I want nothing to do with stolen artwork or his wandering hands for that matter. No, I'm taking a clean break. I'll find another way to do my part for the Reich. What disgusting behaviour. Yes. Absolutely disgusting. When I told Sabine I had quit, she didn't hesitate, "Pack your bags and come to Poland!" How spontaneous! I love it! Sabine, you said that? I couldn't imagine leaving Helene alone in Paris. And Sabine likes to get her way. I'm a little bit jealous. You two are like sisters. (some people coughing) (indistinct chatter) We're going to be OK. We arrive soon. Did you take off your star? No. We're political prisoners. When the Germans took Paris, we were international students at the Sorbonne. That's why you have funny accents. We stayed and organized protests against the occupation. You're lucky you're not Jewish. I go to school too. (man breathing shakily) I mean, I-I did. Do you like it? I don't know. When I learn things, they wash away. (amused sigh) My friend, when he learns things, it's like when you carve it into a stone. You keep the stone your whole life. Really? You must know a lot of things. Aaah. Some people think we are being sent to the camps to be killed. Benj. Don't worry. Why not? My father doesn't think it's true, and he's never wrong. I feel sick. (heavy breathing) I need air. I need... I need... I need... I need air. I... I can't breathe! I can't! I need air! Calm down! Don't touch me! Stop that. I can't breathe! (talking in foreign language) I can't breathe! Get down, you idiot! No! No! (people gasping) That's enough. Get your hands off me! I'm keeping you safe, you understand? (indistinct conversations) man : Quiet. man :  Qu'est-ce qui se passe? Well, of course, your boss was French. I mean, yes, they know how to cook, but their manners? (Heidi and Aurora laughing) I hear they make terrible lovers. That is no rumour. Believe me. (Heidi and Aurora laughing) And what about your work, Heidi? Well, it's one of the most important projects for the future of Germany. I'm intrigued. The staff is almost all women. Intelligent, forward-thinking, independent women. Cultured, like you two. We'll all be friends, I'm sure of it. I'm sure. But I didn't know that Natural Resources were employing so many women. "Natural Resources"? You work with  Obergruppenfuhrer Schmidt, don't you? Uh-uh. In the same building, but different departments. Aaah. What do you do? We are the pioneers of the new Germany. I showed Franz the photos of your new house. You'll love it. Does he enjoy hosting parties? We have many in Poland. Well, he doesn't like small talk and dance, so, no, he doesn't enjoy them. What a pity. You should ask Helene for her secret : not only did she get Franz to dance, but your father as well. Is that so? (Aurora chuckling) Well, Obergruppenfuhrer Schmidt is the one who asked. It would have been rude to decline. Heidi : Yes. That's true. Excuse me. I need some air. Sorry. I'm sorry if I... No. Not at all. The dance meant nothing of course, but sometimes it's hard for a daughter to see her father as a man. Of course. He does dote on her. Tell me more about being a pioneer. distant woman : OK, I need to know... Sir? From Harry. Sent before they left Paris this morning. It took the new girl some time to decrypt the message. They're on a train to Poland. Headed for a concentration camp. The Resistance forger was arrested. How could this happen? I thought Klaus's father... It was just not possible. Did something happen in Paris? Krystina, I'm afraid that I can't agree to your field training. Sir... I need my best people here to bring down Operation Marigold. That means you. (man coughing) (indistinct chatter) I think we need to tell them the truth. Alfred : I think they know. Thank you. What do you mean? When Drabek first told us, we didn't want to believe it. And if you don't believe it, there's hope. And if you have hope... You find a way to survive. Here. (indistinct chatter) Thank you. (train whistle) (door closing) (Aurora gasping) Franz! Yes. Tell me what's happening. The cargo train's just south of us. It crosses our path in Pomoc, just ahead. We'll arrive just before they stop to load, and I'll make sure they're pulled off the train in time. And then what happens? It's taken care of. I'd like to know. I've arranged for a truck at the station. We'll drop them off in the woods before... (brakes squealing) (hubbub) (screaming and machine-gun fire) Is this your people? No. Go! Go! (machine-gun fire) (indistinct chatter) This is it. Is this the camp? Is this the camp? I don't know. (train whistle) Harry : I think I see Faber. Thank Christ. man : I need water. woman : We need to get some food and some water. (indistinct chatter) 
 
 Let's go. Ready? Move it! Ja. I knew it. He's not here. Women and children, off the train! Now, quickly or you will be shot! I will not say it again! Let's go! Move! (people protesting and yelling) Come here. Women and children, let's go! Come on! Come on, let's go! Watch your rifle! Women and children! Stay back! No! Not you! Faster! Let's go! Move! Get over here! Let's go! Women and children! Now! Now! Let's go! I won't leave you. I promise. (man coughing) Let's go! After release. You cannot do this! Is that all of them? That's it. Only men back here. No, we are not splitting up. Either she stays here or I go with her. Let's go! Don't touch her! Let her go! No! (people gasping) Get her off the train! Stay back! Out of my way! What did you do?! Take her. Let's go! On the train! Go! The train move, get going! Now! prisoner : Quiet. Do as they say. Faster! Get up! Faster, go! Move! Move it! How many men were on this car? 26, sir. 47 now. If they are not exactly 47 when we arrive at the camp, every person of this car will be shot! Is that clear? (ominous music) (indistinct talking) Let's go. Lock it up! (gunshots) (people yelling) What's going on?! Take cover! Close the curtains! Status. Armed fighters. They're robbing passengers and executing uniforms. Polish resistance. We make our stand here. Let me help. You two cover that way. (gunshots) Argh! It is my job to ensure that we behave on our journey to the labour camp. We know exactly where we're going and exactly what you are. Everyone, calm down. I just watched my wife shot in the head, and you want me to calm down?! We're all prisoners here. But only one of us is working with the Nazis. You said you know where we are going? To a camp. I don't know which one. But they are work camps, yes? Not all of them. You heard this? Yes. People are sent to camps, and no one hears from them again. Is that true? I don't know anything! Neil : Easy, easy! If you know something, tell us! Yes, tell us! We need to know. Let him go! I will as soon as he tells us everything he knows. I know where we're going. We're headed to a concentration camp, just outside Warsaw. It's an extermination camp. (indistinct chatter) (gunshots) We're out. What do we do? Surrender or we die. Look at Sabine. (faraway yelling) (distant gunshots) We surrender! We surrender! We surrender! Franz : We surrender! We surrender! Get up, all of you! (whispering): Sabine. Ugh! (coughing) Are you deaf? We surrendered! Patience, pig. You're next. Hold on! He's right, they surrendered. The least we can do is give them the courtesy of executing them standing up. We must be doing something right if Adolf's sending a  Brigadefuhrer to deal with us. What is your name? Fine. I'll call you Fritz. Here is this thing, Fritz. Poland is not France. We never surrendered after you invaded us, because, frankly, we'd rather fight until every last one of us is dead. We know this train is carrying a shipment of weapons, and we'd very much like to take them with us. Where are the guns? Silence is not your friend right now,  Brigadefuhrer  Fritz. (train whistle) (bell ringing) You don't know what you're talking about. We had a friend in Paris, Pavel Drabek. He escaped from one of the camps. If the Germans wanted to kill us, why didn't they do it in Paris? Why make us travel all this way? It just doesn't make sense. Does anything the Boche do make sense? We have to escape. But what if he is wrong? What if we are going to the work camp? Do you think that will be any kind of life? Maybe not. I will do everything I can to keep my son alive. Yes. If we do escape, it has to be all of us. We can't condemn the others. Why would we trust him? (indistinct talking) What choice do we have? (indistinct chatter) What is it? You know something, don't you? (inaudible talking) Can you help us? Which one of you is his wife? I'm his wife. Yeah? Now tell me... Helene. Helene. Are you a fortune teller? I ask because I see you are already wearing your ring on your widow hand. Or is it wishful thinking? Very pretty. Is that your wife? Is. That. Your wife? NOOO! (Sabine moaning) (eerie music) All you had to do was say yes! Ready to have a conversation about guns, Fritz? Huh? Yes. Good. (indistinct talking) It's too risky to go. I'm doing this for my family. This is the only reason I help the Germans. I understand. They'll understand too. It doesn't matter. Of course, it matters. You don't understand. Everyone here, we're already dead. Yeah, we're already dead, but only if we don't do anything. Because if we fight, then there's hope. There's hope for everybody here. Including you. Leave her alone. I'll tell you everything. All right. The guns aren't on this train. (sighing) I don't like this answer. I rerouted the shipment at the last minute. The guns arrived in Pruszko on yesterday's train. You're lying. He's not! I oversaw the shipment transfer myself. Yeah? Well, you would've made a worthy opponent, Fritz. No time for last words, I'm afraid, so... Please don't kill us! Stop! Shut up! Please. You're making a mistake. Get out of the way. He's worth more as a prisoner than as a corpse. Kill him. Send a message. Send a message his replacement should be nervous about ever entering Polish soil again. This one made a valid point though. She's right. Leave the women here, take me prisoner. We'll take you all prisoners. If you do, I'll fight until you have to shoot me. Sounds good to me. (woman gasping) I can be valuable to you. (gasping) They promised me that Shira, my sister, they would put her into a work camp. She has a club foot, you understand? So if I didn't say yes, they would have... They use gas. The camps, the rumours you've heard are true. But how can that be? Everyone. They're dead? (indistinct whispering) I'm sorry. No. The truth is better. You are right, we have to escape. All of us. We won't all make it. Isn't it better some of us live than all of us die? You'll remember me, right? Of course, I will. And everyone here? Carved in stone, just like I said. Everything I see or hear. Could you do it for everyone? I could. Please? My friend here is a kind of storyteller. If you tell him something about yourself, he'll never forget it. If he survives, he'll make sure you're all remembered. Right, Benjamin? (overlapping chatter) I think I might have an idea how to get out of here. These are the names of six of our fighters in German custody. I will trade, uh... What's his name? Brigadefuhrer  Franz Faber. I'll trade Fritz for them, 4 p.m. sharp where I've indicated on the paper. But... There will be no negotiation. Unless all six prisoners are there, we'll execute him. I'll deliver this to the Pruszko authorities myself. Good boy. No! Welcome to Poland. Leon Hirsch. I met my wife Clara when we were both working in Toulouse before the war. Harry : Even if we could jump, train's going too fast. When we got on, I noticed the car behind us was being loaded with oil drums. Harry : Oil? (indistinct testimony to Alfred) If we could start a fire... They'd have to stop and put it out or they'd risk blowing up the train. The Germans would have to open the doors. What about the others? What others? In the other cars. Aren't we going to help them escape? He has a point. It'll be risky opening the other wagons. Every car's got a guard on it. So shouldn't we at least try to help free them? I'll do it. I'll open the other wagons. And when the guard opens the door, I'll deal with him. You all run for the woods, and I'll go along the tracks and try to free as many of the others as I can. (indistinct testimony to Alfred) Let's get started then. (emotional music) My name is Charles Stein. I study biology at the Sorbonne. My name is Georges Mandelbau. I'm a dentist. I have a twin brother Louis, but I haven't seen him since the roundup. My name is Jonathan Collard. My wife and I had just opened a café in the Marais. I'm teaching my son everything I know as a plumber, so that after the war, he can take over my business and help rebuild. I am a drummer. Jazz mostly. I have a cousin in America who plays with Nat King Cole, and he says he can get me a gig with him. 15 years I was police officer. I told them I've never even been to temple, but then they wanted  to set an example. A few days ago, I was out trying to sell what little we had left. When I returned, they had taken my wife. I never got to say good-bye. (dramatic music) Fire! The train is on fire! Stop the train! Please! We're on fire! (indistinct cries) Stop the train! Open the doors! (indistinct shouting) Fire! Stop the train! Ugh! Eryk Mlynarczyk. I was a baker in a small village  just outside of Wroclaw. But my younger sister, I don't know where they've taken her. I am Yitzhak Lieberman, 33, cook from Tylice. I live there with my wife, Laila, and our daughter, Maya. Karl Berkovitch. This is my father Samuel. We're both tailors. We moved to Paris last month. Everyone in my family left when the Nazis arrived, but my father was too sick to travel, so I stayed behind to take care... I was separated from my famiy at the Vel' d'Hiv'. My wife's name is Miriam. My daughter is Catherine. The last time I saw her, she had  a pink ribbon in her hair. (gunshots)  I saved six months to get a ticket to Switzerland, but then they said the borders were closed. (gunshots) My name is Henri Meyerson. I was born and raised in Paris, and my wife, Gertie, passed away soon after our son was born. I owned a small bookshop in the Marais. It wasn't much, but it was enough for me and Benjamin. I often wonder what Benjamin will become later in life. I always hoped he would take over the shop. Perhaps he'll start his own. They're getting away! Now, my only purpose is to make sure he can one day make that choice. Alfred! Run! Alfred, run! (gunshots) Hey! Come on! Run! Get some water! Fire in car four! Come on! Don't let them go! (poignant music) (gunshots) (man grunting) (gunshots) Oh! (gunshot) (gunshot) Harry? Harry! Go! Go! Nazi : They're getting away! Come on! Nazi : Stop now! Hands in the air! (two gunshots) There. Give me a hand. Let's go. Let's go! Come on! We'll arrive in Pruszko in a few minutes. Thank you. Don't you touch me! I'm sorry. I... How could you? First, you pretend to be Franz's wife, and then you offer him up to the Resistance? I was only trying to... What's wrong with you?! You have some nerve. Franz was about to be shot. In the head. Helene not only saved his life, but, in all likelihood, saved ours as well. You can be angry about what happened, but don't blame the one person you should be thanking. There was no need... Oh, yes there was. She is a German; we are at war. This is not personal. (indistinct whispering) Must feel that way to her. Hmm. Can I... ask you a question? Of course. Do all women working in Poland carry a gun? Only some of us. I told you, we are pioneers of sorts. Poland is the frontier, and, as we've just seen, there are risks. But it must take a very special kind of woman to handle it all. Yes. And judging by the way you handled yourself with those animals, you'd fit right in. Thank you. man :  Pruszko Station. Arriving at Pruszko! Pruszko Station! Actually, I'm offering you a job. A job? We are short-staffed, and someone with your courage, well, it's worth its weight in gold out here. I'd like you as my associate at Race and Resettlement, starting immediately. Well, I'm... I'm flattered, but can I think about it? You don't have to. I'll take you to a hotel we use, and you can start at the office 9 a.m. sharp. (birds singing) We're going to take you all back to our camp. (indistinct chatter) Let's go. We have to go. Dammit! Still no word from Harry? No, sir. I'm not gonna be able to sleep 'til I know they're safe. It's my fault that they were on that train. Sir? Frommer was supposed to take care of it, but then I told him what had happened. Why? I couldn't lie. If it was William, I would have wanted to know. I put that team at risk because I was... Selfish. I'm not sure what I'd do without you. Krystina, I rely on you. I trust your judgment. But by keeping you here, I'm depriving the war effort of an agent with the skill and the courage needed for us to win. The next operational team that goes out, you're in. I won't let you down. I know. (small sigh) (distant children talking indistinctly) I heard gunshots. Train car of prisoners headed for the camps. They broke out and made a run for it. These are some of the survivors. And you? We lost three men, but we did land a prize. An officer? Even better. Brigadefuhrer. (dramatic music)
