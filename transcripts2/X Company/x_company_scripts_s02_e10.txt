 Previously on X Company... 
 "Mobilizing to Dieppe. Raid's tomorrow at dawn." 
 We take advantage of the distraction and go after Freya. German longrange radar. 
 They want us to get inside the installation, then blow it up. 
 That's what our guerilla army was for. 
 Which we don't have anymore. 
 If I don't report back to my cell, they will deliver anonymous photographs of your wife and me to your superiors.  I saw his fear. 
 His need to protect her. I'm saying maybe he'll work with us. 
 The Germans have an unbreakable code machine, and you're gonna walk out with a chance to break it. 
 (gunshots) 
 Any sign of our reinforcements? 
 No one's getting through. It's a carpet of just... bodies. 
 My God. 
 There's a guerilla team in Pour-De-Lys right now with a critical mission. If we can get to them four good men like you, you could make the difference. 
 I'm glad you're here, Alfred. 
 Me too. 
 Aurora. 
 You just said my name. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm storming the castle. I'm not going to order you to do the same. 
 Ready when you are. 
 Neil : Sergeant. 
 S02E10 
August 19th 
 Harry : It doesn't move like our radar. 
 Watch, look how it stops. It's target-discriminating. 
 So it finds a ship, plane, locks on, tracks it. 
 What's the plan? 
 We've got the grenades. 
 The machine guns'll cut us down before we get close enough. 
 They can hit us; we can't hit them. 
 What about their rear defense? 
 It's too close to the cliff. 
 Which is too steep to scale. 
 We should have at least a dozen more men. 
 There's none coming, Gordie. You were on the beach, you saw. 
 We'll be retreating by now. 
 Which is why our window of opportunity is now. 
 Their eyes are facing forward, focused on the shore. That won't last long. 
 Alright, guys. 
 Change of plan. Our chances of getting the radar intel, leaving no footprint, and coming out in one piece are next to zero. 
 But right now, that station is still sending and receiving information to the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht. 
 It tells the Luftwaffe exactly where to strike. 
 Not if we bring it down. 
 Exactly. If we can cripple it, at least we give your brothers on the beach a shot at getting away. 
 What do you say? 
 You wanted to know why us four tried to storm the HQ. This is why. 
 Can't stand by. Not after what we saw down there. 
 'Specially if we got a chance to save some of our guys. 
 You tell us what to do. 
 OK. 
 Gregson, you and your boys will try and draw fire from cover. We'll flank you. 
 And then we've got a shot at using the grenades. 
 No. 
 No? 
 Sorry, fellas. Can you just give us a minute? 
 Sure. Come on. 
 You really think you've got a chance at turning Franz Faber? 
 Yes, but... 
 Right, then listen. 
 They're beating us with codes, with radar? 
 Our tanks... They're stuck on that beach because we didn't know about the bloody pebbles. We can't fight what we don't know about. We need to crack open German intelligence, right now. 
 You said he let you go to protect his wife. 
 That he was scared. You had access to the documents in his safe. That doesn't look good on him either. 
 If you and Alfred have a way to take advantage of Faber, you have to take it. You need to go back to Paris. 
 We'll work on a plan after we're done here... 
 No. You know the odds. Two more bodies is not gonna make or break what happens here today. 
 Listen, if you don't want me to lead this mission... 
 That's not it. With what you two know, we can't risk letting that... 
 Risk letting that... go to waste if, if we don't make it out of here? 
 You two have faced Faber up close and survived. 
 Who else can say that? 
 You have the connection. 
 You're the only two who could turn him. 
 He's right. 
 Out of the question. 
 If this has any chance of working, we need all hands on deck. We're not turning our back on you. 
 It's a slaughter. 
 German defenses weren't even touched when our men landed. 
 Air reconnaissance missed the German gun positions. 
 How? 
 They were dug in on the cliffs. 
 And our tanks? 
 They were the best. 
 How were we to know? They had flamethrowers, they were designed... 
 If we weren't using someone's holiday snaps as surveillance, we'd have known that they'd have never made it up the beach. 
 Duncan, the Russians have been clamoring for some time for an advance of any kind on the Western front. 
 There will be a political, if not a strategic gain. 
 That's not gonna count for much when the names of these boys start rolling in. (sigh) 
 Guys? Wait for my signal. 
 (guns cocking) 
 Neil : Down to two grenades. 
 Let's make 'em count. 
 On my go. 
 Wait! 
 You see the phone lines? 
 What about them? 
 On a day like today, if we cut the phone lines and they had to switch to radio, would they encode their communications? 
 In the middle of battle? 
 I don't see how they could. 
 It would need to be in real time to be useful. 
 So, theoretically, if we cut the phone lines, we could intercept their radio and read all the communications coming from the station. 
 In clear. 
 Theoretically. 
 Isn't that a lot more valuable than just destroying the radar itself? 
 Cutting the phone lines versus tackling a heavily-gunned station? 
 We have more than enough manpower to do that. 
 You know what that means? 
 You're going after Franz Faber. 
 Be safe. 
 We will. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck. 
 Neil : Take care of yourself. 
 Good luck. 
 Good luck. 
 You too, Harry. 
 (car door opening) 
 You're knocking it out of the park. 
 Just go do it again. 
 (engine starting) 
 (whispering): Bye. 
 (indistinct muttering) 
 (gunshots and bombs exploding) 
 (airplane droning) 
 (car approaching) 
 (intense music) 
 (engine growing louder) 
 (snapping) 
 (phone rings) 
 Franz. 
 So, assuming we can get him face to face,  why doesn't he just arrest us? 
 Because if we don't come back, our cell releases incriminating photos of Sabine, and she'll be shot for treason. 
 What photos? 
 I told him we had photos of her fraternizing with me. 
 But we don't. 
 He doesn't know that. 
 You think that's enough? 
 If we want an ally we can trust, we need to recruit him on principle. 
 So all we have to do is convince him he really wants to betray his own country. 
 That's all we have to do. 
 (distant seagulls) 
 The phone line's cut. 
 Did they see you? 
 Nope. 
 (quiet buzzing) 
 Anything? 
 No. I'd tell you. 
 (quiet squeaking) What about now? Anything now? 
 There it is. (beeping) 
 It's not even coded! 
 It's bloody working! 
 It's unbelievable... 
 Shh! 
 Luftwaffe squadron, they're getting orders to go after the retreating boats. 
 Bastards. 
 Wait, wait. Duppel. 
 What's Duppel? 
 I don't know. 
 The planes are deploying Duppel behind the boats. 
 It's chaff. 
 They're dropping chaff. Flakes of aluminium. Fools our radar into thinking there are planes up there when there's not. 
 Why? 
 Because... 
 Luftwaffe have to refuel. 
 The mighty Luftwaffe won't... (gunshot) 
 (gunfire) 
 (yelling in German) 
 Harry! Tell the command centre the boats need to leave immediately! Ignore their radar! 
 Something's come loose! 
 Hang on! 
 Fast as they can! 
 Luftwaffe can't chase them without running out of gas. 
 Harry, get those ships out of here now! 
 Everyone cover Harry! 
 (grunt) 
 Harry! 
 I know! I know! 
 (indistinct conversation) 
 Just for that moment I saw, in his eyes, past the role he had to play. 
 What'd you see? 
 He was just a man. 
 Fragile. Vulnerable. 
 Good. That's the man we have to target. 
 We've got to find the scrap of a soul that's left in there after everything he's done. What else? 
 He loved his child. 
 He loves his wife. 
 Sabine once told me she thinks the only reason he joined the party was to make a good impression on her father. 
 Good. That's good, if he did it for her. 
 And on the train, she was asking him really tough questions about what Germany's doing and he didn't stand up and defend them. 
 Maybe he never was a true believer. 
 She's forcing him to think about what his job has turned him into. 
 Someone who has to shut down who he is to get the job done. 
 Someone's who's trying to do his duty. 
 Trying not to feel. 
 Could you give me a hand? 
 Do you really think we can do this? 
 There's a chance. 
 People surprise you. 
 It would change everything. 
 (whispering): Are you scared? 
 No. 
 Me neither. 
 Would it cross the line for me to ask... when you said my name, what did it feel like? 
 Something like that. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. We should go. 
 (gunfire) 
 We can't hold out any longer! 
 They're not acknowledging! 
 (grunt) Keep trying! 
 (groaning) 
 I'm gonna go on that ridge. Cover Harry from behind. 
 Tom! 
 There's no time. 
 (gunshots) 
 (whispering): Here she comes. 
 She could be going to meet Faber. 
 Or she could be trying to make an escape. 
 Take the lead. 
 She doesn't know you. 
 (distant seagulls) (gunshots) 
 (clicking) Harry? 
 Almost! 
 (grunting) 
 (click) Gah! 
 (grunting) 
 Tom! 
 (gunshot) 
 Ugh. Out of ammo. 
 Done! Done! 
 Tom! 
 (grunting) 
 Tom! 
 (seagulls squawking) 
 Tom, Tom! Tom, Tom. 
 Look at me. Tom, look at me. Tom. 
 (shaky breathing) 
 I'm not dragging you around the countryside again, mate. 
 Do you hear me? Stay with me, you Yankee b*st*rd. Hey! 
 Hey! Tell me what to do. 
 Tell me what to do! 
 (anguished yelling) 
 Harry : Tom! 
 Tom! 
 We have to go. 
 We have to go, Harry. 
 We can't just leave him. 
 No time. OK? We don't have a choice. We need to go now. 
 No, no, we have to bury him. 
 We've no time! 
 The Germans will be on us any second. If we get caught, it's a bullet to the head. Yeah? Come on, start walking. 
 Harry. 
 Harry. Harry, start walking. He's dead. 
 There's nothing we can do. 
 
 
 
 They did it. The Germans in Pour-de-Lys are transmitting in clear. 
 Everyone's started listening. Our stations in England, even Bletchley. And this just came in. 
 Well, the Freya station's communicating with five, six stations along the coast. Stations we didn't even know were there. 
 And we can pinpoint what frequencies they're using. 
 Radar can see our squadrons on the ground before they even take off. 
 We've been pushing London to invest in radar jammers for months. This should end the debate. 
 And the next time we attempt a landing, we'll have a window in. 
 Take a look at the last section. Our boys managed to catch the Luftwaffe napping in time to help the retreat. 
 You should be proud of your team. 
 I am. 
 There she is. 
 Sabine? 
 Sabine. It's so good to see you. 
 (whispering): It's going to be fine, alright? 
 So we are "friends" again today? 
 Let's not raise our voices. 
 Don't you tell me what to do. 
 Listen! I'm sorry... about how you had to learn the truth. 
 About your husband's work. About me. 
 It must have been a shock, and that's not how I wanted that conversation to go. Trust me. 
 What are you doing? 
 I didn't want to have to fight you for it. 
 Is there a single word out of your mouth you expect me to believe? 
 No gun. 
 Give me my purse. 
 Train tickets to Spain? 
 Give me those back. Please! 
 It's safest for all of us if we just stay calm. 
 Who are you? 
 I know your husband. 
 From his work. I've never seen you before. 
 I was his prisoner. 
 Oh. 
 What do you want? 
 We want you and your husband to be safe. 
 Safe? He said you made threats about using photographs... 
 We need you to walk home with us, get us past the guard, and once we're inside, you're going to telephone your husband. 
 Why? 
 Because what we have to propose to the two of you... it might be the only way to heal what you've endured together. 
 And for you both to find a way out. 
 Do I have a choice? 
 Please. 
 Franz? 
 (seagulls squawking) 
 (German accent): Who's there? 
 Thank you, Sabine, for not saying anything to the guard. 
 You're "Helene." He's your friend. There's nothing to say. 
 I keep my word. 
 I'll call Franz now and tell him to come home. 
 Sit if you like. 
 Don't touch your gun! 
 Alfred : Alright. 
 Sabine, think carefully about what you're doing right now. 
 Now, both of you, get out of my house. 
 We're going. We're gonna walk away slowly. 
 We're going. Slowly. 
 Do you know who you're reminding me of? 
 Just go. 
 Polly Peachum. 
 Don't you dare... (yelling) 
 (grunting) 
 Let's get her on the couch. 
 Get her gun. 
 Careful. 
 I got her. 
 Sabine! 
 She's just unconscious. 
 She's alright. 
 We swear. 
 Get back! Back! Move! 
 What have you done? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I had to knock her out, but it was self-defence. 
 She was frightened. She was armed. You had a chance to shoot me yesterday on the train. But you didn't, because you know it's not wise. 
 So why don't we just put our weapons down? 
 Here, this is yours. 
 Put it down right here. 
 He knows about the photographs. 
 About what happens if we don't make it home. 
 We're not here to kill him. We're just here to talk. 
 So talk. 
 Sabine knows a lot more now than before. 
 About the regime you serve. 
 She'll keep asking questions. Deserving answers. 
 There's no turning back from that now. 
 You tell me about all the nice things she deserves, but you're ready to frame her as a traitor and have her shot? 
 You should make up your mind; which role are you playing now? 
 We'll play whichever... 
 Those compromising pictures of you and Sabine? All they prove is that I was using her to infiltrate your cell. 
 She was pretending to be your friend. Show them to whoever you want to. 
 You know she'll never play along with that story. 
 The two of you will have a lot to talk about and if you want to keep her in your life, Franz... you're gonna have to find some answers of your own. 
 About what you really believe in. 
 Do you know what happened today to your countrymen? 
 I believe you picked the wrong day to try to make a deal with me. 
 You don't know the position I'm in now, what I can do. 
 In your position? 
 What will you do about the deportations... the concentration camps... 
 That has nothing to do with me. 
 The systematic murder of "undesirables." 
 It has everything to do with you. 
 You don't believe in that. 
 Or the "Special Institutes" where they take the children who don't meet the standards of the Reich. 
 We know about your boy. 
 If a loving father smothers the life of his own child to protect him from something even worse, what world is this you're building? 
 We're just trying to get home. We had to leave our boat. 
 They sent me to collect the ID tags. 
 Only the German dead, they said. 
 Who will take theirs? 
 I'm sorry. We just want to get home. 
 Get off the beach. 
 As soon as you can. You don't want to go further. 
 You don't want to see. 
 (yelling) 
 Harry! Harry! (grunting) 
 That's enough! That's enough! 
 Get off me! 
 Get off! Get off him! 
 That's enough. 
 You said we're dead already. If that's the case, then what's the point? What's the point of fighting? 
 Tom dying, these boys dying has to mean something. 
 We have to go on. 
 (crying): I can't. 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 (crying) 
 I can't do this... 
 You poured me a cup of water. Do you remember? 
 You drank from it yourself. 
 We're talking about when your husband and I met. 
 When I was in prison, I felt a connection with you in that cell. I still do. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Yes, you do. You remember. 
 We talked about the feeling when someone you love disappears right out from under your hands. 
 You knew that feeling. 
 Like a piece of your soul is being torn away. 
 In Terre-du-Fils, I saw the same look in your face. 
 You were there? 
 You turned around. 
 You were sick after what you'd done. 
 Do you know their names? 
 The men from that village? 
 Albert Bellerose. Daniel Deforest. 
 Gilles Fournier. 
 Stop. 
 Pierre Sauvage. 
 Thomas Lefebvre. 
 Just stop! 
 I can tell you every one of them. 
 You knew that what you did, what's asked of you... 
 What will keep being asked of you... 
 Has nothing to do with justice! 
 With the kind of future you want to live in with Sabine! 
 Franz, what happened in Terre-du-Fils? 
 A future where you won't need secrets between you, because you'd finally be on the same side. 
 Please, talk to me. 
 I had to. 
 I had to... execute 68 innocent men. 
 As a display of reprisals for the murder of Generalfeldmarschall Brandt. 
 You "had to"? 
 I, I had to. 
 I believed I had to. 
 Like you believed you had to sacrifice your boy to the power you're serving now. 
 What if you didn't? 
 Imagine if you didn't. 
 (crying): His condition. His... only imperfection was that he could only feel one thing at a time. 
 Love. 
 Sadness. Fear. He felt it so deep. 
 Everything was "scared" or "angry." 
 All I had to do was pick him up and show him something joyful. 
 He would change in an instant. 
 If they had taken him, and he would've been scared, I couldn't be there to fix it for him. 
 (sobbing) 
 (crying) 
 You know why we're here. 
 You're on the wrong side, Franz. 
 You can still make it right. 
 For Ulli. 
 (gasping) 
 You know by heart what this looks like... 
 When I pull the trigger, what will happen. 
 (Aurora crying softly) 
 (whispering): You think you know me. 
 Don't say that. 
 You will never contact me or my wife again. Never. 
 You will leave us in peace. If not, she will be found. 
 And I will make sure you will watch. 
 Do you understand? (gasping) 
 Do you understand? 
 (door opening) 
 (door closing) 
 (shaky breathing) 
 Welcome back. 
 You get Faber? 
 Uh, pour you a drink? 
 What happened? 
 You'd have been proud. 
 You'd have been so proud. 
 (crying) 
 Sir, do you have a minute? 
 Yes. 
 A special courier from Paris just came in with a letter from Tom. 
 From Tom? 
 To me. 
 Neil found it. He sent it on. 
 I didn't know you and Tom... 
 Corresponded? 
 Um, I wanted to read this to you. 
 Here. 
 "Being here, with them, and what we're about to do, I'm glad I'm here. I wasn't sure before, but I've been learning to trust my gut. And this feels right." 
 I thought he'd want you to know. 
 Don't blame yourself. 
 No regrets. 
 Thank you. 
 Is there... something else? 
 Yeah. 
 Tom and Krystina : "Funny thing, to just trust your gut. You feel free. I've got more thoughts on the subject. On what feels right. But maybe that should wait till I can tell you in person. (just Krystina): Maybe." 
 (sniffling) 
 That's it. He ran out of time. 
 I'm so... I'm so sorry, Krystina. 
 No, just give me something to do. 
 Right now, I just need something to do. 
 His parents are in Manhattan. 
 I'd like it if it were you who told them. 
 I can do that. 
 The usual... nothing specific. 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 Any luck? 
 Not much to be had. 
 Tin of meat. Black market's running dry. 
 Find something on the road. 
 Where are we heading? 
 We're gonna leave the city. 
 Move east. Wait for orders. 
 (distant door opening) 
 (quietly): Were you followed? 
 No. 
 How did you find us? 
 Why are you here? 
 Albert Bellerose. 
 Daniel Deforest. 
 Gilles Fournier. 
 Ulli Faber. 
 I'm here for them. 
 I'm here for my son. 
 Tell me what it is you want me to do. 
 (dramatic music)
