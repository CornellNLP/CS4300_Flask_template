 Previously on X Company... 
 Everything he's seen here, it can never fall into enemy hands. He can never be taken alive. 
 Targets are civilians. 
 Every one of them. 
 Civilians? 
 Operation Ratcatcher. 
 Is this gonna be a problem? 
 I'd rather not kill if I had the choice. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What am I doing still alive? You sold out 19 people who trusted you! 
 It wasn't me... 
 They call it a concentration camp. 
 This man is not who he says he is, I never saw him before. 
 You lied to me. Who are you? 
 She's a German collaborator. 
 And here's the proof. 
 S01E08 
Into the Fire 
 I warned you. The Gestapo, they're here, look! 
 Get rid of them. 
 Tell them that he's gone. 
 Why should I? 
 You're going to shoot me anyway. 
 What have you done? 
 No, no, no! Come on, you've got to hide. 
 In that closet at the end of the hall. 
 Listen, Simone, I've been watching you. 
 You trade information for goods. You're doing that to help people. 
 Am I right? 
 That's right. 
 You're a good person. 
 You show mercy to this one man, And I'll show you the same, I give you my word. 
 He's gone, you just missed him. 
 Where is he? 
 I'm sorry! 
 I tried to keep him here. He saw you coming, he ran off! 
 - Zurück! Verfolgt ihn. 
 He's wearing a black coat. He can't be far. Stay here. We've got to go, they're gonna be back. Thank you. You understand my position. I do understand. I understand that you were willing to sell this man for knowing what he knows. It's not for me to say what the Germans should or should not do. And they're only Jews, right? You gave me your word. Where I come from, the first day I walked through those gates, they said 'forget decency, forget fair play.' I don't think I got it until today. You said I'm a good person. You gave me your word. You promised! Where are your friends? In the catacombs. Police trucks, they're everywhere. Why would they need that kind of transport? Papers, please? Wait. In here. (sirens nearby) We should be at the catacombs by now. You've been there before? Once. After the raid on the cafe, Rene and I had to go into hiding. The night before, we were all at the cafe. We used to bring all the money we could, and write 'Free France' on it. It was our way of resisting, in the early days. You can't be arrested for circulating money. That's Rene's writing. We left early that night. Back then, the two of us, we were... never... more than... an inch apart. A couple of bottles of wine... and we got there late the next day. We got there just in time to see the rest of them dragged away. I... I'm the last one. We should get off the streets About Rene... What? Nothing. Here. No. It needs to... circulate... do some good. (whistling) At first, there were four who tried to escape, but... Aurora, Alfred, this is Pavel Drabek. There was one guard, we noticed he was wearing a new pair of eyeglasses almost every day. We thought, you know, this is strange. Then one night, I was on garbage disposal detail, and I made a detour around this building here. No one saw me. I passed by a room, and inside, eyeglasses. Eyeglasses? The whole room, full of eyeglasses. In the next room, full of suitcases thrown away. The room after that, human hair. Here, barracks, watch towers, dogs. Here, they tear down the wooden gas chambers and put in concrete. "Improvements," like I said. Gas chambers? A different type of garbage disposal. This is where we bury the dead. Cover them in soil, wait for the bodies to rot The gas makes the earth split. This problem, I am sure they will fix too. Should I stop? No. These words; 'resettling, ' 'processing'... it's all a distraction. This is extermination. Systematic, industrial, extermination... of Jews. My cousin, Lotte... in Nuremberg... we used to write all the time. She stopped writing last year... (sniffling) (crying): My Omi and my Opa. I'll find a rooftop. Get a priority message out. We'll get our people to set up an extraction route for you out of Paris. A lot of police out there... OK, so what do we do? What, we just wait till they all go home? Not gonna happen, there's no... there's no time for that. Operation Ratcatcher was a morale operation. We could start an even bigger one. We can do this... right now. How could they not fight back? How could they not? Neil. We're with you Harry. Quick, quick! One toy each. What do you think, Miriam? Pamina or Tamina? Where are we going? Let's take Pamina, huh? She hasn't seen the countryside yet. We're going to visit with  grand-papa. We can show her the orchard. Help your brother, he needs to choose too, and some clothes. But it's Esther's birthday party tomorrow. She'll understand. What about  Maman? Is she coming? Of course she is... As soon... as she's home, we'll be ready. Elias, which one? We need you for two more trips today... (inaudible) Excuse me. Excuse me! How long will these trucks be here? What's it to you? I'm moving house today. The van will be arriving soon and your vehicles are blocking the way. We won't be long. What's happening today? You chose a bad time to move. Starting today, property values go up. What do you mean? We're cleaning the streets. Of yellow stars. Tell us more about what you saw. You don't need to know more. The Gestapo looking for you? Alfred has a gift. A perfect memory. So if anything happens to you, your story survives, word for word, every single thing you saw. That's not much of a gift... is it? Our leaders need to hear your story. You'll be the beginning of the end of this. My God. "...Given high priority of intel request immediate extraction." How many camps like this could there be? Mustn't focus on that right now. We need to find someone to help them get Drabek out. Someone not involved in Ratcatcher. Anton's cell. He's got import-export connections. Good. Kate, make contact, let him know what's coming. Krystina... I'll tell Harry to expect him. Well? My team hit their targets... But...? There's someone we urgently need to extract... Permission denied. They're to go to ground as instructed... If you'll let me explain... This team in particular would benefit from being kept on a shorter leash. You don't seem to understa... BSO knew of no plan for the mass extermination of Jews? No, there were... rumors. There were also unsubstantiated reports from Czechoslovakia. A story from a Swedish diplomat, nothing first-hand. And nothing this monstrous. We need to get this man out. Yes. Yes, we do. We have two teams in the 17th and 19th. It's too far. Well, perhaps your people sit tight. Keep the man safe until we work out a plan. It has to be today. The French police are tied up in their own operation. The Gestapo are distracted. Tomorrow... Tomorrow they may not be. We need to take advantage of what's going on in the streets. It's dangerous. When isn't it? Do it. I already gave the order. (whistling) They're sending 2 Resistance to help work around the roads. There's a massive police operation starting up there... Yeah, we saw the trucks, what's going on? They're starting to round up Jews. "Cleaning the streets." Forcing families at gunpoint. It's like every police officer in France is out there. Here too. People are just standing by watching it happen? That's because they don't know where they're being taken. Take on a whole police force? We've got to kick people in the ass, tell them looking the other way is not an option. How? A message. Leaflets. We just need a printing press, paper... All printing materials are under German control. If we could print them, how do we get them into people's hands? A plane. Something small, a crop duster, anything! You're serious? Whatever you do today, it won't stop what's happening. I know that, but we can't just stand around here. Earlier today... on the way to the cafe; L'Assiette De Laurent.  They print daily menus. They'd have a press. Ulli. (phone ringing) We have no other choice. Ja? (whistling) Any news from Sinclair? There's an old Mureaux reconnaissance plane in a garage just outside the city. Held together by tape and spit but the owner's a friendly. He's gonna meet Tom and Neil at the restaurant. That's good. Thank you. It seems somehow the burden is lighter. The two of us knowing. There are nights when all I want is to forget. Erase all I've seen. Four months ago... all I wanted was to be able to forget. But now I realize; if you remember something... you're responsible for it. We're going to get you out. So that everyone who hears becomes responsible. Ah! There it is. Do you even know how to use one of these things? (sighing): We'll figure it out. (noise above) Excuse me. (gasp) This your place? Can you give us a hand operating that printing press? You type what you want here, you feed the paper in here, you crank this way and if it runs low on ink, you fill here. Right. Do you mind me asking; why were you robbing your own restaurant? It was only a matter of time before they find out my real name is Metzstein and come kicking in my door. I'd rather not give them that pleasure. You want me to stay and help? No. Do what you need to do. Thank you. Good luck. Right. We tell it as it is? A call to arms to fight back. It's the last thing we should do. People need to know about the camps. An explicit message will get anybody holding that piece of paper shot. No, no. You want to mobilize, you want to sell, you have to look past the facts, past the brain, straight to the heart... a poem. You can't get arrested for holding a poem. A poem. Yeah. A love poem for France, but... but in disguise. Something to... to spark up some courage, some patriotic pride. It's about brave, raging, ready-to-die-for-you love. The kind of love that's made stronger by staying hidden, right? Hm. Yeah. OK. "For you... "For you... my... ragged... heart... break free." What? Let me see if I can help. Harry. I need to tell you something, I need it to stay between us. Sure. I saw a photo at our target's house... of Rene. Rene? There was something off. In the photo, he wears his watch on his left hand. OK, I don't... But on the body they found in the river, it was on his right. What are you saying? I'm saying maybe he did survive the fall. And the body wasn't his. Maybe he staged his own death to stay safe. The Germans were looking for him. We never saw the body's face. Don't say anything to her for now. Not 'til we know for sure. The bottle is broken. It was only half full. 
 
 Hello, Harry. Hello... Um,  Wow, sorry, I don't remember your name. It's fine, I never told you my name. Standard security. I knew you lot were headed here but I didn't think our paths would cross so soon. I'm told you have import-export connections. It's all arranged. We need to move soon. Look at you. How are you feeling? Yeah, no... good. Can I see the wounds? Sure! Beautiful. Every scar tells a story, doesn't it? Yeah. And how's the chest? Ah, it's good. It's fine. Well, I mean, at least I... I think so. Maybe... Beautiful story here too. Yeah, I didn't, uh... I didn't say anything too embarrassing, did I? When I was on the morphine? You must hear a lot... I just want to make sure... Maybe one day I'll tell you. We'd better get to work. All roads are risky. Security is heightened today, but we have a way to get you out: by boat. By boat? Water is safer than the land. It's harder for them to control the checkpoints, especially at night. We have a small fishing vessel waiting for you in an hour. 7:30 sharp, near the warehouse district. The fisherman will take you down the Seine to the coast, and from there to Britain. Assuming good weather and the like. Ready? Last part's not working. 'Cause you've got it wrong. All this is... fine, it's poetic, it's just... it's just like... Sometimes, you need to... take this and... tear it to pieces. Like a fist through glass. The love you have, yeah? Your love of France... you refuse to hide it no matter what they do. Because that's how you know who you are, what you are... and you'd give anything, everything... to get that back. Anyway, you're the one who knows what sells. No no, no, that's... good. That's really good. What was her name? You don't have to tell me. Fei Yen. Nice name. We'll say... Marianne. She's a symbol of the French Revolution. It should go right over the Germans' heads. Alright, be quick. I'll get the ink ready, he'll be here soon. (busy voices and seagulls) This man... you and your friends are going to a lot of trouble for him. He's Polish Resistance. He broke into hell on purpose and then he broke his way out again. They're called "concentration camps". Thousands of Jews killed and every day that goes by, hundreds more, that's why we've gotta get his story out now. It's got to be propaganda. What, you think this is all an act? The last one, good luck! Thank you. What are the chances he doesn't get shot down? Come on, we shouldn't be up here. (moaning and grunting) (little cries) Please, he needs his medicine. Clothes for 2 days, that's it. Departments 112, 113... Let me go back inside. (grunt) Ah! We're supposed to get back... Move! "Cleaning the streets." It's what's it's about. Not standing by. Putting your fist through the goddamn glass. Too right. Stay back. Wait, wait, don't... Keep your distance, we stay in pairs. Is it true? What he told me? Are we nearly there? Yes. In front of the granary warehouse 7. Whole families? We should give him a break. Alright? Move. Move! Maman! Move! Maman! Get in the truck. She's pregnant, we're supposed to leave those ones behind. Just put her in, they'll sort them later. Sit! (whimpering and crying) We can't wait anymore. We have to go. What about Maman? She'll know where to find us. Come on, take your toys. Out the fire escape. (knocking and voices) Tür öffnen. I'm the only one home. (more knocking and voices) Like when we play... You know what to do. Sh. Hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry. Open the door! Julien Cohn? Yes? Papa! We'll get you out of here. Where will we go? We have contacts outside of Paris, we'll figure it out, OK? No, but they are bringing us back home. They said "clothes for 2 days". They're not bringing you home. You have me, let her go! How can you arrest a child? You're going to let them do this? You're going to let this happen? I'm French, just like you. In the truck. Where do you think they're taking us, huh? Work camps? They're taking the old, the sick. My daughter is nine. All you have to do is turn your back, let me take her. Pretend we weren't at home. Get in the truck! (grunt and cries) Miriam, run! Come here! Come here! (screams) In the truck! Go! Go, get in the truck! (more shots fired) In the back. Take them out, two of them! (yelling) (Click!) sh1t. (gunshot and grunt) Go! I'll cover! (more shots) Go! (grunt) Come on! (gunshot) Ah! (screams) (whimpering) This is it. The boat should be here any minute. Let's get into position. Can I have a moment? Thank you. For everything... Harry... OK, look, I am... I didn't think I'd see you again. And I might not after this, so... So I'm just going to say it... I told you about my husband? How he died. Fighting for his country to be free? Go keep a look out. It was true. But it wasn't France he was fighting for, it was Ireland. For freedom from the British. I swore to him that I'd keep fighting and so I have! The Germans promised, after victory, they'll liberate Ireland... What are you saying? The workers over there. The workers near the barrels. They're German agents. Don't turn. Oberfuhrer Franz Faber knows about you. He knows about your friend with the memory. As soon as the boat's here, they'll close in. You're walking into a trap. You're an agent for the Germans? All this time... I had no I idea what they were doing, what kind of people they were... When I was on the morphine, what did I say? There's no time, Harry! What did I tell you? What did I tell you? I'll go now, they're watching. Look like nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong? I just betrayed my team, nothing's wrong? I'm sorry, Harry. (sobbing) I'm so sorry. There's two men... dock workers, they're Gestapo. No, no, no, don't look. They're watching. How do you know? Our friend, the nurse. How does she know? She's working for the Germans. The boat's in view, we'll leave you here. Good luck. Your friend, she left. What do you mean, she left? She's a German agent. No. We screen everyone. You screened her yourself? No. They did, in Marmonne. There's two workers by the warehouse, and right now, I'm trying to decide whether to shoot them first or you. I swear, I didn't know. We call it off and go back the way we came. Let's go. Trucks, trucks, trucks. OK, Come. - Jawohl! Allez, macht schnell! Allez, allez! Wir haben nur ein paar Minute! Mach schon. Mach schon. Only one way out, through the granary. We cover Alfred and Drabek so they can get through the building and back into the city. Harry... This is all my fault. Doesn't matter. We'll cover the trucks both sides. Here, take it. Take it! Ready? On three... two... one. Ah! (German cries) (grunt) (choking) (screams in German) Run! Run! Go, go, go! - Kommt! Jawohl! Schnell, schnell, schnell! Er ist da hinten. Da. Noch zwei. Almost out of ammo. Me too. Pick your moments. (yelps) Go for the door. I'll hold them off. Get somewhere safe. Go, go, go, go! (yelps) Don't move! Hands in the air! Drop your weapon. Move! Now! Los. Vielleicht da oben? It's Alfred they wanted. You follow Drabek. Make sure he stays safe. Go! OK, OK. Die anderen kommen mit mir! Arme nach oben. Hier haben wir was. (sobbing) (airplane engine above) "Mariane, of my heart, how it beats for you still beyond each shattered part, yet it beats for you still. At the dawn, wrongs we suffered, inflicted at will. They were written on seams of a heart that still beams, still. Do not mourn, Mariane, for a love that has passed or the world born before we began for the walls they have built to hold secrets won't last. They'll not silence our voice, Mariane." (quiet sobs) (loud sobbing) "And in each shattered part of a broken man's soul, there's a shard, holding hope unfulfilled. Seize it now, Liberty! It will guide our way home. Through the night's darkest sky, light will spill. (airplane engine)  Seize it now. Smash the chain.  Find the pride, past the shame. Take my hand, speak my name. Tear down wall after wall.  Split the sky, feel the rain...  Heed my cry, hear my call. Rise again, Mariane, I will fight for you still. Rise again. I will fight for you still. Rise again." (footsteps) (door opening) I've just been on to London. Word is that thousands of Jews have been rounded up in Paris. Crammed into a stadium, in inhuman conditions. Children and elderly... not spared. How did we know nothing about this? 'Cause our attention was on the enemy. This is French police deputized civilians following German orders. That can't go on. Not after today. You made a good call, Duncan. It's hard... these odds. There will be an invasion. Concentrate on the vicinity of Dieppe. We'll be ready. Sir. Yes? It's Alfred. (heavy doors slamming) (heavy footsteps) (unlatching of metallic doors) You're going to tell me... everything you know.
