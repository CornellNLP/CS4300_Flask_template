 soldier : Halt! Halt! 
 (train whistle) 
 I don't believe it. 
 A female mayor. Are you serious? 
 Thank you. 
 These are exceptional times. 
 There are no capable men in St. Antoine? I mean, how does anything get done? 
 She has to take care of her family, no? 
 We like to think that we are her family. 
 She has cared for us well. 
 The war has not touched us too much, thank God. 
 Alfred : How fortunate. 
 Mayor Bellaire plays it smart, preserves our ways. 
 She's done "housekeeping" of a different kind. You know. 
 woman : Jean. 
 It's nice to have a... clean town. 
 We are free. 
 We police ourselves. 
 The germans will turn out to be a good thing. 
 Politics, Jean. 
 St. Antoine, next stop! 
 Oh, you are lovely together. 
 I expect you'll be having children soon, yes? 
 It is an exciting time to be young. 
 Enjoy your stay in St. Antoine. 
 Thank you. Goodbye. 
 Bye. 
 "Housekeeping?" 
 It's sickening. 
 It's like they can't even hear themselves. 
 You know what I heard? SS officers are being redeployed to the east - minimal military in town. 
 They've purged "undesirables." 
 And they have fresh fruit, which means the germans have locked down another southern supply route. 
 And apparently we're lovely together. 
 Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. 
 The team is gathering in St. Antoine. 
 Their rendezvous is scheduled for later today. 
 I'm sorry, sir, that's all I know. I'll do my best, but... 
 He's here. 
 Yeah, that's fine. Ah, yes, of course. 
 Just tell him to save me some, all right? OK, bye, Mom. 
 Sir? We've confirmed arrival in St. Antoine, and the mission is still off the record. 
 Good, good. Thank you, Krystina. 
 I guess the question is why is this mission off the record? 
 It won't be much longer. 
 I don't recognize the source's name, sir. "Tourist." 
 That's because the mission didn't come from London. 
 And they're not in the need to know? 
 That's right. 
 How do we know Tourist is a reliable source? 
 It's a calculated risk. You know that. 
 It puts us in a sensitive position, sir, regarding our colleagues in London... who pay our bills. 
 The Americans are losing a thousand boys a month to german u-boats. 
 They're getting their asses handed to them in the Pacific. 
 When we succeed in St. Antoine, we will brief London, and then we'll step back and let them take the credit. 
 Or Tourist will stand back as you take the blame if it fails, and London will replace you with someone they can trust. 
 Works out pretty well... for Tourist. 
 I appreciate your honesty. 
 (secret knock) 
 Where have you been? 
 Shopping for candles. 
 I got here last night. 
 Tom and Neil have been shadowing the mayor for two days. 
 And? 
 And we're worried. 
 She's real cozy with Jürgen Keller, the local SS boss. Harry, I heard you found the family that was hit by the bomb. 
 Are you all right? 
 Please just let me work. 
 Thank you. Who else do we need to know about in your network? 
 In this town, I am the network. 
 So we're on our own. 
 There's no chance Marie Bellaire is on our side. 
 Oh, we have our sources. 
 You trust them? 
 My superiors do. 
 They don't live here. 
 That woman would do anything to keep the germans happy. 
 All of you... are walking into a trap. 
 I will try to find  some for you. It's delicious! 
 Like tamarind? 
 It's a kind of tamarind sauce but we make it with cherry and brandy. 
 You will like it. 
 (Officer chuckles.) 
 Who is responsible for raising the flags? 
 It's Bernard. It's a young man, right here. 
 Bernard! 
 Give me your belt. 
 There is a footprint on our flag. 
 Oh, Bernard. 
 A flag is more than a piece of cloth! 
 It's an inspiration, an ideal, a deeply potent symbol. 
 Symbols shape belief; belief shapes action. 
 That is why we treat them with respect. 
 Thank you, Hauptsturmführer. 
 It's time. 
 I might have something special for you this afternoon. 
 I look forward to it. 
 Marie. 
 Be quiet or I'll slit your throat. 
 Go, go! (tires screeching) 
 Don't look at us unless you want to be shot. 
 You contacted the Americans to offer your help? 
 So they send you to throw a bag over my head? 
 No wonder you're losing the war. 
 It's a courtesy that will save your life if we decide we can't trust you. 
 We see you're being wined and dined by the germans. 
 Tell us why we should trust you. 
 Yes... I work with the Nazis. 
 But everything I've done was to protect the people of St. Antoine. 
 You have no idea how difficult it is to try to keep the balance between the rights of one citizen against another, and there's no way to keep everyone happy. 
 Especially not the jews. 
 Gustave? 
 But that's right. 
 They're not citizens of St. Antoine anymore. 
 There's not an ounce of practicality in you, Gustave! 
 It would have happened anyway. 
 And thanks to me, the men of St. Antoine don't slave in german factories. You drive 20km north or west out of town. You ask the families whose houses were seized. I have kept the peace. 
 Your peace has too high a price. 
 All right, all right. 
 Yes, I compromise, but don't for one second assume... 
 I do it willingly. 
 The germans have been keeping you comfortable for quite a while. 
 Why should we believe that you're willing to betray them now? 
 There's a girl... 
 Isabelle Dupuis. 
 She's been killed, and I need your help to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
 And if I break my word, I don't care if you shoot me. 
 They told me there were openings in an elite school for girls... free room and board, the highest standards of education and cultural activities and athletics, and so on. The girls were to be far from the reach of the war, in the countryside somewhere. 
 Hauptsturmführer Keller, he told me to draw up a list of names of local girls. The brightest, the healthiest, the prettiest, the most accomplished students  which of course 
 I was happy to do. 
 Only six young women  in all of St. Antoine were selected,  including Isabelle Dupuis,  and... and my own niece... (camera flash) Claire. 
 Last week, Isabelle Dupuis was shot by the gates of a fortified house, just outside of town. 
 I can't get answers from Keller, and if I push too hard, I'll lose his trust. 
 His champagne and oysters as well. 
 Gustave. 
 If it's guarded, it must be valuable for you, and I can get you inside! 
 I understand your concern for those girls... 
 I need to know if they're there! I need to know if they're all right! 
 That's not why we're here! 
 We need your help to blow up a train. 
 There's three u-boat outposts on the coast, all supplied by a train which runs through St. Antoine. 
 It's due sometime in the next few days. 
 They're carrying T3 torpedoes, enough to supply u-boat operations for three weeks. 
 We need to know which train, and when it arrives. 
 To be of value, I have to stay in office. 
 You must understand this. 
 Surely, I can't get involved. 
 One thousand, two hundred and eighty-four. 
 That's how many merchant seamen were lost to u-boats in the last three weeks. 
 One train, for 1,300 lives... that's why we're here. 
 We'll detonate the train outside of town, away from civilians. It'll look like an accident. 
 Trains... break down and derail all the time, and this is the most pacified town in all of France. 
 There's no reason to suspect sabotage. 
 What do you need from me? 
 The manifest for the transport schedule, so we know which is our target train. 
 I'll bring you the manifest if you'll get inside the SS building and find out what happened to our girls. 
 That's not how it works. 
 You trust that I won't give you away to the germans; I trust that you won't sacrifice me to your short-term needs. 
 Exchange of goodwill. Fair? 
 All right. 
 Right, I can get you in there today. 
 Boys. With me. 
 Neil : We'll work a plan for the train. 
 Alfred. 
 So, you see, Gustave? That's how things get done. 
 softly : Watch her close. 
 She's not wrong, the mayor. Sometimes it helps to pass for what people want to see. 
 After my mom left, my father said the only way to survive was to keep my head down, hide my condition, keep myself to myself. 
 People don't like anomalies. 
 My dad told me to never speak german at home, to pronounce my name "Luft" instead of "Looft." 
 Between that and the jewish thing... let's just say I... I know a lot about imaginary friends. 
 You're jewish? 
 Half. German-jewish, but it's not something I advertise. 
 Papers. 
 (females singing) 
 I need you to stay here. I'm gonna look upstairs. 
 man : Come on! Get up! 
 (girl crying out) 
 (girl yelling and crying) 
 girl : Please! 
 Please! 
 (knocking on door) 
 Claire? Shh, shh, shh! 
 I'm not gonna hurt you. 
 Your aunt sent me. Marie Bellaire. 
 She's been... thinking a lot about you. 
 What is this place? 
 Is this a hospital? Are you sick? 
 Your aunt asked us to come here, to make sure you were all right. 
 Please, you... you can't tell her. 
 Tell her what? 
 She would be so ashamed. 
 (baby crying) 
 (babies crying) 
 Claire : We were told we were being taken to a school. 
 This isn't a school; *** Give me the gun. Give me the gun and get in the back. What are you doing? That's not the knock. The manifest? I kept my word. No offence, madame. Good as gold. Were you expecting a battalion? I don't know what to expect from you anymore, Marie. Idiot. Whoa, wait a sec. The train's coming today? Today? Yeah, less than two hours. We're not gonna have enough time to get to the dead drop and get the rail charges. Maybe we don't need rail charges. Look: the train itself is an explosive. T3 torpedoes, rounds for deck guns. Ok, here's what we do. We get inside the train when it stops for servicing, take apart the casings, rig them with pencil fuses. Boom. You said it would look like an accident. This won't come back on you. We need to find a way onto that train. A lot of women believe in the program. They say, "I'm gonna have a baby for our Führer." Some of them have SS boyfriends. Us St. Antoine girls, we have to pretend to be like them. What happens to the babies? They're the property of the SS. They're taken away, adopted by germans. Unless... What? Unless they're not perfect. parents :  Eins... zwei... all : Drei! (door opening) (man and woman arguing nearby) Wooo! They say the guards are to protect us, but if you try to leave... They shot Isabelle right in front of me. I don't think they want me alive after what I saw. (sniffling) Once they have my baby... 
 
 (knocking on door) You can't be here. Fräulein Claire, good afternoon. How are you feeling? Stand up for me, please. So... you tried to leave us last week. I'm sorry to hear that. As far as I can tell, you haven't damaged the baby. Step onto the scale. I don't understand why you would take that chance. This is a very special responsibility you have. You should take your example from the other residents here. They know how lucky they are. Your weight is exactly the same. Eighty-seven centimeters. You're not eating. You have to eat... for the baby. (whispering): Come! Now! Claire : Karen, please. Who are you? What are you doing here? He's a friend of my aunt. You have to go! No outsiders. If either of us are caught... Please let him help. Can you get us out? You know  what happens here? Claire's just across the hall. She's pregnant. I told her we'd get her out. The other girls too. We don't have a plan. And if we get caught, what? The girls get lined up and shot like Isabelle? We're not just gonna leave them here. We have inside help. (whispering): Tell him to hurry. He's nearly finished his rounds. What about the supplies? Hold on. It's today, the thing we came for. They have their hands full. Today? What time? The train's due at 4:40. The service stop is only about 10 minutes. Harry's gonna get in there, use his pencil fuses. Four forty. We can work with that. We'll use it as a distraction. Put the mayor on. Yes? It's a Nazi program run by the SS. birth houses for the "racially pure." It's not only here; they have houses in Austria, in Denmark, in Norway. That's why they took Claire and the other St. Antoine girls. We're gonna try to get her out. Please. I'm putting Claire on the line. You have to make this fast. Hello? Claire! Oh, Claire! I'm so happy to hear your voice. They shot Isabelle. I know. Please tell  Maman  something from me. Tell her I'm sorry. Oh, It's not your fault,  ma chouette. It's my fault... If you want to help, do exactly what they tell you. We'll do our best to get her out. Please. Tell me what to do. Anything. It has to be today. Now, tell the others to be ready. Listen for an explosion, then run for the service entrance. Bring nothing with you. Tell me about the crews that service the train. They're French. They'll do what I tell them to. Yeah, but we want them to do their job as usual. We just don't want them to see anything. What about the german station guards? How do we make sure they don't see anything? They'll do whatever Jürgen Keller tells them to do. (steam hissing) Hauptsturmführer. You remember I said I might be able to bring you something special? Yes. Apfelschnapps. Brought to me by Francois, for you. Thank you. Francois is the son of a very, very dear friend of mine. He's being considered for a position as photojournalist at the  Chronique du Pays. Congratulations. Madame Bellaire said you might be willing to be photographed and interviewed for my portrait series,  Men of Our Time. Did she? If you have time. But it won't take a minute. Well... why not? Right here? Ah... maybe something more artistic. Oh, you know the flags. That would make a statement. "Symbols shape belief, and belief... shapes action." Maybe you could persuade some of your men, your men in uniform, to stand beside you, huh? That would be a very strong image. A good idea. Here? No, please, over here. Here! Yes, yes. Perfect. Yes, gather. Gather around. Ah, if... if you could come in. Yes. Ok. Very good. Wait! May I have my photo taken with you, please? Yeah, sure, madame. Shall we? Tom : Ah, perfect. Hey! (neck breaking) Uh, ok, four bombs wired together should be enough to create the initial blast. Just four? Uh-huh, they're triggers. The train itself is the real bomb. Ah, perfect, ok.  "Sprengbombe... Zylindrich." Ok. Um, two more. Two more like this, at, uh, f-f-f-five-foot increments. Harry, pull it together. Do you know how much explosive force is in this thing? The only thing you're blowing up is this train. Mistakes happen. Not today. The only place this bomb's going off is out of harm's way. Yeah? Ok, that's one. Two... Three down. They'll be nearly finished their maintenance. Oh, no. Two words I prefer not to hear. It's defective. I need another one. Now! It's not even wired up. There's something stuck inside. Will this do? Uh... yeah. That's why we aspire to a higher standard of purity... purity of thought, purity of purpose. Purity of race. Yes, which reminds me, Mayor, there is a new initiative that I wanted to share with you. You can put it into your article too. A summer camp for boys, ages six to nine. We'll teach them life skills, discipline, and, most importantly, german culture. Maintenance is complete, Haupsturmführer. All good. Let it go. Perhaps you can offer some recommendations. About 20 boys to start? They may be French, but they can still aspire to a higher standard. Huh? Of course. Ok. Give me a sec. Done! Done! Ok, let's get out of here. The guards are back. We'll walk right into them. (train whistle) Ok, ok, we stay on the train. Wait for the curve in the track after the bridge? Will we have time? Sure. Yeah, yeah. It's a 10-minute fuse. They're 90% accurate. To heal your body, you have to get rid of germs. With a nation... Marie : Is something wrong? Stop the train! Stop the train! Stop the train! Stop the train! man : Stop the train! Jürgen : Stop! Bloody hell! man : Stop the train! What about my town? What about my people? They've already set the fuse off. Well, they must stop it! No, they won't. They have orders. That train's worth a lot of lives. No. Let the train go, Jürgen! Tell the train to go, Jürgen! Now! Or I swear, I'll shoot you! Alfred : There are too many guards. Aurora : The explosion will draw them away. Alfred : It should have happened by now. Let the train go. Now! My mistake. All clear! Go now! soldier : Go! Marie : Thank you. Marie. Explain this to me. Just... trying to aspire to a higher standard. Los, mitkommen. Hauptsturmführer. Stehen bleiben. Sie auch. (train whistle) Neil : We're just over the bridge! Ready? It's close! Go! (explosion) (screaming) (air raid siren) (screaming) Proceed to the basement! Immediately! Everyone, please, remain calm! This way! Hurry! Stay away from the windows, and proceed to the basement! Claire, where are you going? Outside. I need you down in the basement now. But I want to check if the girls outside are all right... For your own safety. Come! No, no! Please! No! Please! No! Leave me alone, Bohm! I need to go! I need to go! Fräulein! No, let me go! No! Aurora : What? Claire! It's Claire! What? The doctor's got her! I'm going back in for her! No! No, no, no! They'll see you and then they'll come for all of us! Alfred, Alfred, we have to go. Come on. We have to go now! Halt. Up here. It just came in. And? The train torpedoed itself just outside of town. Good job, Harry. But for that to happen, the mayor had to show her hand. She's in custody. She wouldn't know the names of the team. I'll have to have a conversation with London, explain to them that we just went a little rogue. What is it? I'd like to train as a field agent. I'm a good shot. I transmit as fast as Harry. My Polish is fluent; my german is terrible but I learn fast. Well, we can do that. But let me ask you this: is it because you want to be a field agent? Or is it because you don't like talking to the brits behind my back? Sir... It's all right. That's how it works. And frankly, well, I'm glad it's you. So, I can approve your training, or... you can stay right here and we can continue to work together. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? I do. What do you think? I think Italy is due to report in. I'll go see what we got from Kate. Very well. (knocking on door) The train was sabotaged. Whose work was it? You have kind eyes. What a strange thing. Tell me what I want to know, and this will all stop. No more pain. Oh, that is kind, isn't it? Who are you working with? I wanted to protect them... my people, my girls. We held hands, didn't we, you and I? "Sometimes you need to walk with the devil until you've crossed the bridge." Madame! All that time, drawing up lists... handing over a niece, sending away boys. Now I realize the bridge never ends. Who are you working with? What are you scared of? This is your last chance. I only wanted to help her, to keep her safe. I loved her... (gunshot) (Jürgen breathing unsteadily) What else? She remembers two other men. Wilhelm someone, three silver squares here. So, an  Untersturmführer. With a son who's a prisoner in Russia. He acts as attachee and courier to the Italians. And there was a pilot: Andraeus Falker or Falken... she's not sure. He talked about the planes having a fault with their cameras. And... he had an eagle ring on his right hand. We can trace that. Keep going. Madeleine Gauthier. She's 17. fair hair. But he had a cleft lip. And one morning I wanted to look at him. She wanted to look at him. She went into the nursery, and the doctor was there. The baby was crying, squirming. She saw the doctor... inject the child, and he went still. They pushed his body into a bin like they were clearing a table. She... she never saw him again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's fine. It's fine. Shhh. (secret knock) Tom : They said they can only hide two. Alfred : It's a shame to split them all up. Tom : I wish we could just... send them home. Alfred : Yeah. What have you got there? It was in the defective bomb. I think it was sabotaged.
