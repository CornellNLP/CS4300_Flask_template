 Previously on  X Company... 
 I need you to be Alfred's spotter. 
 That special, is he? 
 Franz, what happened in Terre-du-Fils? 
 I executed 68 innocent men. 
 I believed I had to. 
 That's the man we have to target. We've got to find the scrap of a soul that's left in there after everything he's done. 
 (groaning in pain) 
 Tom! Tom! 
 No, no... (sobbing) 
 What happened? 
 You'd have been so proud. 
 What would you say if I told you that today you had an opportunity to serve your country? 
 There's a canvas detonator inside. 
 Snapping it in half pulls the canvas. 
 Four seconds later, it's over. 
 Klaus! What are you doing? 
 Kristina! (gunshot) 
 (groan) 
 When you said my name, what did it feel like? 
 Where's Miri? 
 The last I saw her, she was picking off Germans from a church tower. 
 Don't move. 
 Why are you here? 
 I'm here for my son. 
 Tell me what it is you want me to do. 
 S03E01 - Creon vs. Ixion 
 (straining): Yah! 
 (mumbling) 
 Creon has landed! 
 How was your flight? 
 How good is this safe house? 
 It's good. The head administrator's pro-Resistance. 
 Easy to say. 
 He's been patching up our boys since the Germans hit Paris. 
 He's on our side. 
 Are you sure? 
 We're sure. This... The whole wing is ours. 
 It's the new Tuberculosis Ward, so... nobody wants to come close. 
 It's a good idea. 
 It was Tom's. 
 Where's Neil? 
 (panting) 
 Oh... 
 (moaning) 
 (woman's voice with a French accent): Hello? 
 You're looking for someone? 
 A young woman. Long dark hair. 
 A black shirt. The Germans had her. 
 One of the prisoners. 
 You saw them? 
 (sighing): They stopped at my farm. Took our food. 
 They were taking them north. 
 You know where? 
 No. 
 When? 
 A few hours ago. 
 (Sniff!) 
 We're picking up Faber in about 20 minutes. 
 And his wife? 
 Wants to keep her out of it. 
 Out of the question. 
 It was his condition. 
 She's a civilian, knows too much, needs to understand what it means to keep her mouth shut. 
 That's gonna provoke him. 
 Irrelevant. You get him here and secure, you go and get her. 
 Understood. 
 Where have you been? 
 We lost one of our recruits. 
 Miri. 
 The Roma girl. 
 She was taken at Dieppe. 
 I think I know where she is. 
 It's not our priority. 
 She's the reason I'm alive. 
 We're about to land one of the biggest assets we've ever had. 
 She'll disappear. She'll be shot, you know what they do. 
 She know about this safe house? 
 No. 
 Good. No reason to go after her. 
 Just like that? 
 I'm not risking any one of my agents who know what you know. 
 Which is what? 
 That an Oberfuhrer is willing to work for the Allies. 
 Or it could just be the first move in a long con. 
 It could. But sometimes the only way to know the truth  is to look a man in the eye. 
 You'll get used to it. 
 Your signature, sir. 
 What is this? 
 A troop requisition for Oberfuhrer Fischer. 
 What is the operation? 
 A student group suspected of crimes against the state. 
 Don't worry about the details. 
 Trust your staff. That's what they're for. 
 How does it feel? 
 You're right, everything takes getting used to. 
 Do it quickly. I'm leaving for Berlin. 
 Today? 
 Tomorrow morning. 
 You think I'd miss your celebration this evening? 
 (knocking) Of course. 
 Your wife must be looking forward to it It is a promotion for her as well, isn't it? 
 For you. 
 Really, Franz. You don't look well. 
 You should pace yourself. 
 The war will end soon enough. 
 Bring your boss a coffee. 
 And make sure he's at his desk at five, feeling sharp. 
 I'm expecting a telephone call. 
 You didn't tell him? 
 It is a call of congratulations you won't want to miss. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (random shouting) 
 Our latest recruit. 
 A lot of blank spots. 
 Hopefully not for long. Franz Faber's family? 
 We have his mother and father. 
 Farmers, right? 
 Both deceased. 
 Wife's side? 
 All we got is her maiden name. Schmidt. 
 German for Smith? That oughta narrow it down. 
 Keep at it. Get creative. Anything we can use for added leverage. 
 Where're you going? 
 I'm going to get a drink. 
 (suspicious music) 
 (indistinct children's voices) 
 (ambient music and indistinct conversations) 
 Women's entrance is around the corner. 
 You want me to go outside and come back in again? 
 What'll it be? 
 Rye and ginger...? 
 Is that a question? 
 OK... (slowly, with pause) Rye and ginger. 
 So... how's your day so far? 
 Already looking up, thanks. 
 Glad to help. 
 Come on, don't tell me you're here on your own? 
 Today, I am. 
 Where's the lucky man? 
 In the service? 
 Was. 
 Killed in action, some... beach in France. 
 Some place that has nothing to do with us. 
 (indistinct kids' voices) 
 (cocking sound) Stay quiet. 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Being cautious. Belt and holster. 
 You can't be seen in uniform. 
 (stressful music) 
 Do not mistake this for the tables being turned. 
 Just get in the chair. 
 His mother was devastated. 
 There was nothing I could say. 
 A bit early, eh? 
 What the hell, I will have a... beer. 
 (ambient music) 
 Beer, please? 
 You're not gonna tell, are you? 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Ahh... 
 Busy day? 
 I... saw you walking down the other side of the street and, uh... (little chuckle) don't get me wrong, this isn't something I usually do, but can I buy you a drink? 
 I'm doing just fine. 
 Hm! I'm Aaron Berkman. 
 Not gonna tell me your name? 
 You know what, pal? 
 There's plenty of tables. 
 You got a problem with me? 
 Maybe you should double the hell back out of my bar. 
 This is us telling you the nice way. 
 (As he leaves.): Ahem! 
 Goddamned Jews! 
 (birds chirping) 
 There had better be an excellent reason. 
 Someone we wanted you to meet. 
 Franz Faber! 
 I'm Duncan Sinclair. 
 You're surprised to see me. 
 Should I know who you are? 
 You had my photograph in your office safe. 
 You sent a man to try to kill me and sabotage my communications. 
 How is he? 
 Has he not reported in? 
 Why are you here? 
 Someone of  your  rank behind enemy lines, is that wise? 
 Is it wise that someone of your rank... is offering to work for the Allies? 
 This was not the protocol. 
 Change of plan for my security. 
 I need to know if I can trust you. 
 That goes both ways. 
 How does your wife feel about you working for the Allies? 
 I assume you told her? 
 Yes. 
 She knows. 
 Good. 
 Alfred and Aurora are bringing her in. 
 That's not the deal we made. 
 All due respect to my team, I'm the one making the deal today. 
 She will be kept out of this. 
 She's already in it. 
 She knows that you came to us. 
 She'd be considered a traitor for not reporting you. 
 She's a risk to herself, and to us if she makes a single false move. 
 You will not contact her. 
 It's too late. 
 Is there something that you're not telling me? 
 (loud engine noise) 
 (indistinct city noises) 
 (sighing): She's not at the park or the church. 
 The café? 
 She... could be inside. 
 Then, why won't she answer the telephone? 
 (bells ringing) This doesn't feel right. 
 Hey. Sinclair brought chocolate. 
 Wanna go halves? 
 Are you twelve? You know what that's for. 
 Yes, I know what it's for. 
 It's for battering. 
 For favours. 
 I know! 
 Just tryin'a... take your mind off things. 
 I was this close. She could be anywhere now. 
 (indistinct voices nearby) She's strong. 
 We'll get to her when we can. 
 Because she's not useful right now. 
 Not as important as we are. 
 Not as important as that Nazi in there. 
 Just another life. Got to keep your eye on that bloody big picture. 
 It's not what I was saying. 
 I bet he'd know where she's being taken. 
 Madame... stop, please. 
 Good morning! 
 I am here to see Sabine Faber. 
 I'm sorry, but I can't let you in. 
 (little chuckle) 
 You know me. I'm Helene Bauer. 
 I was here with her just last week. 
 She was due to meet me at the cafe over an hour ago. Now she's not answering the telephone so I'm worried that something might have happened to her. 
 May I please just go up and check on her? 
 I'm afraid not. 
 What is your name, sir? 
 Sturmmann Graff. 
 I will make sure to mention you to the Oberfuhrer next time I see him. 
 Frau Faber is not at home today. 
 Well, you might have mentioned that. 
 Then, where is she? 
 I couldn't say. 
 Couldn't? Is that professional discretion or just pure ignorance? 
 Discretion, Frau Bauer. Generally... 
 Discretion is for strangers or unwelcomed guests. 
 I'm neither. 
 Where is she? 
 I shouldn't be here, I should really get back. 
 Who says? 
 (sighing): Yeah... 
 Yeah, who says? Crummy job anyway. 
 Boss gets all the glamour, takes all the credit. 
 And that is why I'm my own boss. 
 Hm... smart. 
 Everybody in this country always tells you what to do. 
 I think the least we can do is choose how to spend our days. 
 Yeah... 
 I told him not to sign up. 
 I mean, what have the Germans ever done to us? 
 We're sending decent Canadian citizens over there to die on their beaches for nothing. It's not like we stand a chance. 
 Sorry... I shouldn't. 
 It's the... it's the rye talking. 
 Well, it's common sense. 
 The sooner the Germans get it done, the more lives we save. 
 Most people don't see it that way. 
 We aren't "most people" here. 
 You can speak freely at my bar. 
 I consider it my patriotic duty to defend that freedom. 
 (customers): Hear, hear! Cheers! 
 Well... sign me up, boys! 
 (little chuckle) So... is this a club? 
 What do you do, get together and talk freely? 
 You think we're all talk? 
 I dunno... you tell me. 
 Maybe I'll show you. 
 Sorry about the mess. 
 You don't see many of these anymore, not in this neck of the woods. 
 No, you don't! 
 You play? 
 Never thrown a ball in my life. 
 But I have swung a bat. 
 Christie Pits, back in '33? 
 You're probably too young to remember. 
 Nope. My Dad was in on that fight. 
 I wanted to go. See the yids get what's coming to them, but... he wouldn't let me. 
 It was quite a night. 
 Last time we got to carry that flag. 
 In public anyway. 
 I heard about that group, down in the Beaches. 
 The Swastika Club? 
 Yeah. We were just good citizens trying to keep things clean. 
 And now? 
 Now, I put like-minded people in touch with each other. 
 Like-minded? 
 There's ways we can do our part from here. 
 Help the Germans get it done? 
 Hm... we speak the same language. 
 (hit and groan) 
 Ah! Ah! Ah. 
 Don't make me hurt you. 
 I won't be dragged from my office in the middle of the day. 
 Fair enough. 
 There's a library across from my office, third floor. 
 Hang a yellow sash on the curtain instead of blue. 
 I will return the signal. 
 Let's just make sure that we have an understanding here first. 
 I've asked your team before, what is it you want me to do? 
 I want you to help build Aurora's cover as Helene Bauer. 
 Go on. 
 She'll be your handler, she'll provide you with regular instruction. 
 I see. Anything else? 
 I want a list of every informant in the area, specifically those trying to infiltrate Resistance cells. 
 This is not what we agreed. 
 This is what it looks like to be a double agent. 
 You know why I'm here. 
 To mitigate the excesses, the liquidation of unworthy citizens. 
 Aurora told me about your son. 
 Then you know what I'm asking. 
 The death camps. 
 We feel the same way, but that is not a battle we can win by bombing. 
 Our best bet... is to wipe out the disease. 
 The Reich. 
 Win the war. 
 You'll never win. You saw what happened in Dieppe. 
 Sabine left your apartment two nights ago with luggage and she hasn't been seen since. 
 What happened? 
 Answer the question. 
 What happened was I told her I was gonna work with you. 
 So when you came to us, she didn't already know? 
 I hadn't told her before, no. It was for her own safety. 
 Then... it became unavoidable. 
 I didn't think she'd react the way she did. 
 Which was how? 
 She said that I was out of my mind. 
 She said... "I can't do this." 
 Can't do what? 
 Live here? Stay married? 
 Betray Germany? 
 Where is she, Franz? 
 (suspenseful music) 
 I have no idea. 
 
 
 
 (indistinct conversation nearby) 
 Two days. She could've gone anywhere in two days. 
 That's the problem. 
 So she's gone and we have no idea where our loyalties are. 
 That's why we need to find her fast, assuming she's in Paris. 
 He's got agents everywhere. 
 Why can't he track her down? 
 No, that's the last thing he should do. He needs to keep this as quiet as possible. 
 Contact the camp, mobilize our Paris agents, check anywhere she might have been seen. 
 Metro, train stations... 
 Bus depots and hotels. 
 Could she have gone to a friend? 
 I was all she had I swear on my life, I've never seen that man before. 
 I don't know anything about him. 
 He's a German agent, he worked with the Royal Care Society, made regular visits to a German POW camp in Bowmanville. 
 Twelve days ago he failed to show up for work after committing an act of treason. Where is he? 
 How would I know if I've never seen him? 
 (cocking of the gun) 
 You can't do this. I know my rights! 
 You can yell as loud as you want. We've rounded up your rats. We've got a dozen soldiers outside. 
 You're lying. 
 You've already confessed to high treason, punishment is severe. Help us help you! 
 Yes or no? 
 AH! 
 This is me asking you in the nice way. 
 ALRIGHT! 
 I've never seen him. 
 A couple of times, I've done a guy a favour. 
 He comes in here... with an envelope or something and I stash it in a church and I call another guy and let him know it's there. 
 Go on. 
 About two weeks ago, I had to leave an envelope... with a letter to a POW. 
 Call him... let him know you have another package for him, he needs to get it today. 
 If you give him a distress signal and he doesn't show up at the church, my colleague gets the last word with you. 
 We need to bring your wife into line. 
 I will not have her put at risk. 
 You want to help us, this is the first step. 
 We are all at risk without Sabine on our side. 
 Sir, we have the text for the transmission to the Camp. 
 I need you to check it. 
 Neil, watch him. 
 (indistinct voices in the other room) 
 You don't know where she is... or even if she's safe. 
 I have the same problem. 
 The Gypsy? 
 You know? 
 My informant at Varages said the English guerrilla leader had a Gypsy girlfriend. 
 A sharpshooter, Miri. 
 Keep talking. 
 A woman of that description was recently arrested for shooting soldiers from a bell tower in Dieppe. 
 Where is she? Is she alive? 
 As far as I know. 
 Where was she taken? 
 Tell me where she is. 
 Please. 
 (series of clicks) 
 What are you thinking about? 
 Dieppe. You. 
 Standing on top of that tank on fire. 
 The tank, I mean. Not you. 
 (with a chuckle): The best part of that was the view. 
 Seeing that jeep at the far end of the field carrying you back. 
 And you... you get to relive those moments, you get to... see them, to smell them. 
 It's as real as the present, every time. 
 Hm... so, when you were a little boy, you could spend a whole day inside... the memory of the first time you tasted ice cream? 
 I still can. 
 Any first taste. 
 We don't have to talk about what happened. 
 But I wouldn't mind if it happened again. 
 Early Bird. The camp says to wait at the usual place. Password is Early Bird. 
 Anyone in Paris with news of Sabine's whereabouts will call in. 
 Good, I'll go. 
 Harry, watch him. 
 Neil. 
 Neil! 
 What the hell's going on? 
 I told him where he might find his friend, Miri. 
 You did what? 
 She was probably transported along with the other Dieppe insurgents to a holding station near Val-des-Plaines, just north of Paris. 
 Harry, bring him back. 
 Neil! Neil! 
 Go back, Harry. 
 Don't do this. Sinclair's orders! 
 Even if you could find the holding station... even if she's still there, still alive, what are you going to do, huh? What, you're going to break her out on your own? Get yourself arrested? Get yourself killed? 
 I'm not going to let you do that. I can't let you... 
 Are you finished, will you shut your mouth? 
 No, I'm not gonna shut my mouth. You can't do this. 
 All those bodies, all those boys on the beach, they were following orders, and for what? 
 There is no "for what" anymore. 
 It's "for who", that's all we have left. 
 I have to see her, I have to. 
 We didn't get to say goodbye. 
 Are you still standing in my way? 
 Hey! 
 Hey! Get out. 
 Now! Go! 
 OK! 
 (suspenseful music) 
 Get in! 
 This is the best you could do? 
 Move over. 
 Go on! (sigh) 
 (phone ringing) 
 This is Early Bird. 
 The concierge at the Hotel Renier confirms a friend checked in yesterday morning. 
 Is she still there? 
 She left a half hour ago, but he expects her back. 
 Thank you. 
 Your agent Neil asked me  a question, I answered. A test if you like. 
 A test? 
 To know who I'm dealing with. 
 Now is not the time. This is not your business. 
 I came here last week with an offer to assist you... 
 That's right:  you  came to  us. 
 That was before my decision cost me my wife. 
 Before you dragged me through the streets in a wheelchair thinking that I will be your errand boy, give you unlimited access to all my files. And now, you seriously expect me to put my life, my wife's life, into your hands? Into the hands of this team when they're all safety risks? 
 This team has been one step... 
 Neil is insubordinate, Harry clearly can't bring him in line! 
 And your vaudevillian is in love with Aurora. 
 I've seen him resist the extremes of his own pain. 
 But when I threatened her back at my apartment, he became compliant immediately. That's not even  his  failure; it's yours for letting the two work together. 
 As far as I'm concerned, I cannot trust the lot of you. 
 This arrangement is off. 
 Franz. (cocking of a gun) 
 You know I can't let you do that. 
 My people are hand-picked and well trained. 
 They've been through hell and they're still standing. 
 Yes, they are human, but I consider that a plus. 
 I'm not willing to gamble on what you consider a plus. 
 Last warning. 
 You'd actually shoot? 
 What would you do in my position. 
 Colonel! - I would shoot. 
 That's my point. 
 But that's me. 
 Your call. 
 Sir! 
 Please remember why we're here. 
 I used to be afraid of stepping out my front door. 
 Then you came along out of nowhere and you told me I could do something that mattered. 
 But it wasn't the colonel who recruited me, it was the father with one son left, the man who was afraid for the future. 
 And I've seen you crying on your knees, Afraid of what you'd turned into. Because everywhere you look, you see your own boy reaching out to you, asking why you let go of him. 
 You have a son? 
 William. 
 You're fighting for him. 
 I stopped fighting for principles a long time ago. 
 He's probably not even alive, but even if he isn't... 
 He's why you're here. 
 What happened to him? 
 Shot down in the Pacific. 
 I was right. 
 About what? 
 You have no control over your people. 
 You will respect my terms. 
 We'll start small. 
 We'll use your protocol. 
 No visits to the home or office. 
 You will protect my position. You will not compromise me or my wife. 
 (sound of engines) 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (stressful music) 
 (cocking of gun) 
 Your hands behind your head. 
 (fighting exertions) 
 AAH! 
 (impact and moan) 
 (choking sounds) 
 (gunshot and scream of pain) 
 (panting) 
 (groan) 
 Oh no, you don't! 
 (effort exertions) 
 Let's get him out back to the jeep. 
 (panting) 
 (clicking of handcuffs) 
 (birds chirping) Just up ahead. 
 Stop ahead. 
 We'll ditch the car in the woods and do a reckie on foot. 
 Did he say how big the holding station was? 
 Oh sh1t. 
 Do a U-turn. 
 That'll hardly look suspicious. 
 What, so we're gonna run right into them? 
 We're French civilians with nothing to hide. 
 Stop! 
 (engine off and brake on) 
 There's just three of them. 
 Could be 20 more in there. 
 Don't move. Hands in the air. 
 Get out of the car. 
 Is something wrong? 
 Get out of the car! 
 (suspenseful music) 
 Did we do something wrong? 
 There. 
 Go there! Come on! 
 Turn around. 
 Turn. Turn! 
 On the ground! 
 I said on the ground! 
 (dramatic music building) 
 Would it have been so hard to check the fuel before we left? 
 Go get the hose! 
 They expect us in Caillefaux in 40 minutes. I'm not going to take the blame for this! We need your gas. 
 Good call coming on the road trip. 
 I've seen her, I've seen Sabine. 
 Is she alright? 
 I'm not sure. 
 She is at the Hotel Renier. She was escorted by an SS Officer and his security entourage. 
 What was the man's rank? 
 It was two diamonds and three leaves. 
 Obergruppenfuhrer. 
 I should have known. 
 Known what? 
 Obergruppenfuhrer Ulrich Schmidt Ulrich Waldemar Schmidt. Late wife, Elsa Elisabeth. PhD in Mathematics. Currently Minister of Natural Resources. 
 He's one of Himmler's inner circle. 
 He's her father. 
 Yes. 
 That's fine. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you hungry? 
 I ordered  petits fours. 
 Thank you. 
 These are my favourites too! 
 No, I mean for coming all this way. 
 It was selfish of me to think you would have the time. 
 I wanted to. 
 And I had to be here for this evening. 
 How's your room? 
 Perfect. 
 402, just down the hall. 
 I missed you... hearing your voice. 
 But you sounded so upset. 
 You've been quiet since the train station. 
 What is it, Bine? 
 What was it you couldn't tell me on the telephone? 
 I don't know where to start. 
 Ulli... He died five weeks ago. 
 (Lets out a breath.) 
 I'm so sorry. (She starts to cry.) 
 Oh, Sabine, I'm so sorry. 
 There was no one I could talk to, no one who knew him. 
 I've been so alone. 
 What about Franz? 
 How close is Sabine with her father? 
 Very close. He's always been protective of her. Especially since her mother died Close enough she'd tell him too much? 
 She wouldn't. 
 You don't seem so sure. 
 Let's go to the hotel. 
 There may be a way to make sure she cooperates. 
 If it's not too late. 
 Be careful. If she's said anything, they'll be on the lookout. 
 We're always careful. 
 I need to get back to my office. 
 You can't, not yet. 
 There's a telephone call at 5 o'clock from Berlin. 
 It's been scheduled for 2 days. 
 For 2 days? 
 It's just a call of congratulations. 
 Nevertheless. 
 What's the occasion? 
 My promotion to Brigadefuhrer. 
 For my contribution to our success at Dieppe. 
 From the man himself? 
 I see. 
 Well, the thing is, if Sabine talked, it doesn't matter if you're back for that call or not. 
 Trust my team. 
 They will figure out where we stand. 
 We'll get you back in time if it's safe. 
 Now, I know that I said we'd start out small, but that was before... I knew about your promotion. 
 And your father-in-law. 
 What do you say we... don't start out small? 
 What do you mean? 
 What if there's a way to win this war a little faster. 
 Off the battlefield. Lives... saved on both sides. 
 You think the Nazis can't lose, let's talk about what's keeping their war going. 
 Let's talk about oil. 
 How're you doing, Fritz? Good? 
 Yeah? 
 Look at you. I can't wait to see the look on my girlfriend's face when I tell her I got to kick actual Fascist ass today. 
 Sorry. I was kidding. 
 But I... do get to watch, right? 
 Interrogation training? 
 Go. 
 Both of you! I'll make sure you get credit for the extracurricular. 
 (sighing): Alright. Let me know if you need anything. 
 Anything at all. 
 (door closing) So? 
 What happened? 
 Did the Frommer boy chicken out? 
 No. 
 Klaus Frommer, who was a brave, gentle, patriotic young man, actually managed to smuggle the bomb you gave him into the Camp, and came this close to blowing up our Communications Centre and taking our Colonel down with him. 
 I'm sorry... you said he "was"? 
 I shot him. 
 Huh... 
 How did that go? 
 I have a duty to the uniform I wear to treat prisoners with respect and civility. 
 But right now, my boss is out of town. 
 And there's no one here but me... and you. 
 Ja! 
 Could be worse. At least, we're almost there. 
 You, sit down. I said, "Sit down!" 
 Did you hear that? 
 There's no soldiers in there, they're prisoners. 
 (sound of engine) 
 (words exchanged in German) 
 Where did they say they were going? 
 Uh, it sounded like Caillefaux. 
 I think it was Caillefaux. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 I'll get it ready. 
 Meet you back here. 
 I know it's hard,  but maybe we should look for a silver lining. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, it sounds wrong to say this but, uh... maybe it's for the best. 
 Poor Ulli, he wasn't well. 
 He wasn't sick. 
 No, no, of course, uh... what I mean is... despite all the love... all the love in the world you had for him, Mongoloids never develop normally. 
 And when you think about the future, what would it have been? 
 For him? 
 For you? 
 You are still so young... you have so much to hope for. 
 The most important thing is what happened is not your fault. 
 (hushed): Oh, Papa. 
 It's not  your  fault. 
 I blame myself. Maybe I should've had Franz's background checked more thoroughly. 
 I always knew you deserved better. 
 But I saw how you loved him. 
 He made you laugh... for the first time since we lost Mama. 
 I only wanted to make you happy again, which you will be... 
 I promise. 
 Now, I wish the timing was better. 
 But I'm expecting someone for a meeting. 
 Sweetheart... was there something else you wanted to tell me? 
 No. I'll go to my room, maybe lie down. 
 'Bine, what is it? 
 Please. 
 You can tell your father. 
 Papa... it's serious. 
 It's about Franz. 
 Announcer : Next week, on an all new  X Company. 
 Papa, please listen to me, Hans is not the man I thought he was. 
 What's your relationship with him? 
 Complicated. 
 Is there anything I should know? 
 This is something I trusted you with. 
 Announcer :  X Company,  next Wednesday at 9:00 on  CBC.
