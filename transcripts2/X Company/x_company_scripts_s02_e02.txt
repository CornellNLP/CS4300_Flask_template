 (whooshing) 
 Previously on I saw a photo of Rene. There was something off. In the photo, he wears his watch on his left hand. On the body they found in the river, it was on his right. Maybe he did survive the fall. Don't say anything to her for now. Not till we know for sure. Drop your weapon! It's Alfred they wanted. He was your protégé, your calculated risk. Do you know how long agents last under interrogation? (grunting) Do you think this is a game? Under 24 hours. You know what has to happen. I take full responsibility. Come on! (cries) The wound's infected. There's nothing I can do. He needs treatment. Otherwise, he's got maybe a week before he dies of sepsis. He needs a hospital. Let's get him in! Come on, Tom. I could feel the life  draining out of him, right under my hands. Do you know what that's like? Feeling the life of someone you love disappear from your hands? To want it back. The ache. You do know. (slam) If we don't get Alfred out and he talks, we're finished. Your war is over. So this is what we're going to do. Rene. What have they done to you? S02E02 
Night Will End Any luck? This is our best bet, sir. It's a POW camp. Offlag 24. Officers. Good. But they'll have been worked nearly to death. Malnourished. If they're gonna help us with the operation... I know, sir, but we've lost most of our network in France. These are trained soldiers, motivated to fight. As soon as Colonel Sinclair returns, we'll start planning. In the meantime, I want these transmissions sent to London, spaced apart in two-hour intervals. You've already encrypted them? That's right. Is there any reason they can't be sent out together? Yes, there is. Of course. Word from London. Tom's on his way back to the camp. What's his condition? Septic bullet wound, but they managed to stabilize him. Thank you, Alice. Please tell me as soon as he lands. Sir. (typewriter tapping) (phone ringing) (crickets chirping) (grunting) You gonna tell me what happened, then? With the nurse? She's dead. What? Is Aurora still debriefing with Sinclair? Yep. She in trouble? Why would she be in trouble? How was he taken alive is my question, Aurora. I told you, they were all over him. I didn't have a clear line of sight and then they threw him in the car. I never had the shot. You knew there was a risk putting someone like him in the field. I'm in the field to fix this mess, Sergeant. I'm not on vacation. Now, one of your team talked. That was the morphine. He was barely conscious. The other is in Gestapo custody. We've all been compromised. You should be split up and reassigned. But we are four weeks, Sergeant, four weeks from a massive Allied push. Now what would you do, Aurora, if you were me? You mean about me? As a leader? That's not my job, sir. It's yours. What do you have, Harry? Uh, I didn't have long to case it out yesterday, but... there are guard positions on all four corners, mounted machine guns, barbed wire here, east entrances manned by two soldiers, and these windows here are reinforced. It's impenetrable. Weapons? We'd need 20 Lugers... rifles... say... 10 to 15 resistance at each entry? How much TNT? Uh, 20 pounds, at least. And 8 improvised grenades. OK. Emile Deschamps. The Gestapo are after him. He needs a clean way out. You'll help him, he'll help us. Terry, get on the radio. Neil! I'll find a truck. What about this German, then? His name's  Obersturmbahnfuhrer Ernst Frommer. He works behind-the-scenes in logistics. Training movements, military infrastructure. He's a bureaucrat. A cog in the machine. Kind of man you'd never look at twice. Check your pocket. (with accent): It's not him. (whispering): No. There are more. This is just where I could shove the latest. After the roundup, the morgue's bursting. (quietly): That's not him either. Madame, I have more to pick up from the Velodrome. And as I said, you shouldn't be here. May I please look through the rest? (shaky breathing) He disappeared three days ago, and... he didn't have his papers on him, so... Be quick. (door opening and closing) Please say something. What happens next? (thumping) (muffled speaking in German) There are people I know. They had a friend who was killed. I saw a photograph of him lying down in the mud. In the photo, he wears his watch on his right hand, but when he was alive, he wore his watch on his left. I know who you are. (muffled voices) They'll kill me either way. Whether you talk or you don't. So don't. Don't try and save me. I'm already dead. (door opening) (distant woman's voice) (birds chirping) Your hair! You should give it a try. It's less work. But Greta won't allow it. You can't be here. I'm not, officially. I don't like this, Duncan. It won't take long. Let's have a seat. So how is Greta? She's well. Enjoying Paris. Well, who wouldn't? And your boys? Both of them? Oliver was shot down over Britain. William's missing in action. Klaus went missing too. Eastern Front a few months ago. I've heard no news. I try to stay hopeful but... Russians are savages. I gather from your unorthodox invitation you're in a new line of business. Do you realize I still wear a uniform? And that my uniform is an oath to my country? I should report you right now. Ernst, I'm gambling on your other loyalties. As a friend and as a father. I've a proposition. It's an informal prisoner exchange. I need a man transferred out of the Gestapo HQ in Paris. I'm not in control of transfers. I know that. But you could ensure that his transfer convoy pass by a particular stretch of road at a particular time. How do you know what I'm able to do? Ernst, I also know that your son Klaus got shot down over Moscow in October. He's in a Russian POW camp. He's not doing well. What is his squadron? Luftflotte 2. Now, I can have him transferred to a Canadian POW camp. That's a five-star resort compared to the hellhole he's in right now. What's your rank, Duncan, that you can get the Russians to release a German? If you agree, I will provide proof that Klaus is in Canada. (distant voices) The position you're putting me in. You arrogant b*st*rd. Out of nowhere. What you ask, it would make me a traitor. What would Greta say? No, don't stoop to that. I love my son. But so does every German father whose sons are out there, offering their lives for a better future. Would you betray your country, to get William a ticket to a five-star resort? How would you sleep? (man): Papers, please. If I'm getting caught even speaking to you, I'll be shot. I'm sorry, Ernst. This is far from fair. The choice is yours. Now, let's start from the beginning. Tell me about foreign intelligence networks in France. Start with your own cell. There's a young man, his name is Harry. He's skilled with explosives. A woman. In Villemarie, she went by the name Marie-Rose Tavernier. Saw her briefly myself at a restaurant in Poitiers. Aurora? She murdered a colleague of mine. (crashing) Is there anything you'd like to say? (groaning) No. No! (yelling) No! (tapping) Relay should start soon, as long as the code works. (sigh) Harry, Aurora. On the docks, she said she didn't have the shot. Do you believe her? Why would she lie? (papers rustling) Anything you'd like to say about this nurse? It was stupid. Yes, it was. It's the oldest trick in the book. The pretty girl who acts like she likes you. Even if we do get Alfred, you're gonna send me home, right? Decommission me? It's something I have to consider, Harry. Just let me stay. Please. At least until I've made this right. (indistinct chatter) (squeaking radio) Yes? The two of you, you're a part of the same circle of agents. Sent from Canada? (grunting) (squelching) (groaning) (glass clinking) He's been in here for a very long time. There's not much left of him. So if you don't talk soon... (crying) Now when I come back, it's going to get worse. Until what you've seen in here today blots out everything else. Your father, your mother. And all you will think about, what will be in your memory, is the look on his face, the sound of his screaming, as he dies because of you. (heavy breathing) 
 
 (door slamming) Dechamps? Where's the other one? You're welcome. It's not enough. The jammer has no power without batteries. Have you seen the police on those streets? I need three. Minimum. Where's Aurora? Maybe she can help you out. Aurora is busy, Harry. Start with what you have, please. Can I ask you a question? Sure. This German friend of yours; putting a lot of faith in him. How'd you know him? It was the end of the First War and he was starving to death. He had no ammo, no rations, no boots. But he struggled to keep his dignity. Spoke English, knew Shakespeare. I helped him out. Yeah? After the war, he tracked me down through my unit. Started writing letters. Next thing you know, we're on Lake Constance, fishing with our sons. Why? Curious. Report said that you spent some time with a German radio operator in Marmonne before you had to kill him. What about it? It's difficult, Neil. When you get to know them. Harry needs another battery. (phone ringing) You knew they were gonna use you to try and get me to talk. (spitting) Yeah. How? Brigitte. The Gestapo brought her here. Who's Brigitte? Someone they knew I cared about. I'm sorry. Does Aurora know that I'm still alive? I couldn't tell her. I couldn't do that to her, in case I was wrong. Probably best. She should live her life. She thinks of you all the time. She told me once, she said, "There's no greatness too small." (laughing) I said that. She thinks the world of you. What's your name? Alfred. Alfred. If you see her again, please, don't tell her you saw me. But... Let her remember me the way I was. (inaudible) It is done. The timing is good. Trains and aircraft are needed in the East right now. Thank you, Ernst. I'm just moving toy trains and planes from one place to another. It doesn't... doesn't mean anything. You do what you have to, in difficult times. You'll see my boy? Yes. I plan to tell him what you were like as a young man. Warts and all? I never saw any warts. Be kind to him. I will. When this is all over, contact me. I'll try to protect you, you and your family. But don't fool yourself, Duncan. Europe is ours. We have vast resources in our control. And the last war, we lost because of the Jews. We are taking care of that now. I thought it was because we kicked you in the ass. The  Fuhrer  is a brilliant man, but he's not known to be compromising. I'm concerned what he'll do after victory. So please, Duncan, let me help you. Thank you, Ernst. Maybe then we can have another holiday. Lake Constance, beer, ice cream by the water. That would be something. I told you it helps to think of your ex. Katherine, Jenny, you're up. (woman): Gun range? Close-combat room. Cover for them? It would be a lot easier in pants and sensible shoes. Because if the enemy ever does attack the camp, they'll wait politely while we dash off and change? I almost wish they would attack. What? Don't you want all this training to pay off? The target practice? Mm. Come on. Are you telling me you get a bigger kick out of scrambling letters around? You should be in the field. I'm just saying I wouldn't mind getting a little closer to the action. Or to Tom? That wasn't the action I had in mind. Radio traffic's still down, by the way. Fewer decrypts in from London. Any idea why? Word is the German's have upgraded their coding machine. Colonel Mayhew says Bletchley hasn't slept since. Have you finished sending his reports? Just one left. Why is he having us send them every two hours? He wouldn't tell me. You should take a closer look. We're not authorized. I know he encrypted them himself. It's not just that. Take a look at the tag. This is Sinclair's tag. Why is Mayhew sending reports... Pretending to be Sinclair? Good question. (door slamming) (liquid splashing) (gagging) Don't. Don't, please. Have you reconsidered? (choking) Please! Please. It's a bad death. You don't die right away, not until after your insides burn. There's a smell when human flesh burns. It's gonna be a part of you. Always. (gagging) Yes or no? So yes or no? I was just thinking... of my first job at university, picking  zuckerrubben. What's the word in English? Sugar beet. ...screaming for results. (retching and spitting) (wheezing) OK, let's go. (accordion playing) Move back! Stay here. Good. Yes. Everyone stay here. Stay here. (Accordionist plays one note repeatedly.) That's E flat major. Keep going. It's from her. It's a message. Get in. (suspenseful music) You alright? I'm ready. For what? When we get there. I'll make a run for it. They'll shoot. I want it to be over. Not yet. I can't say more, in case I'm wrong. (with accent): Ah, I'm sorry. It's my truck; I can't move it. (distant German voices) We'll have about five minutes. Let's go. (beeping) Alright. (humming) Ah, it's not the tire. It's the axle. What's up? Ah, no. No... You didn't fix it, did you? Don't, don't lie to me, Gregoire. I was going to get it fixed next week. Move this truck! What can I do? Sir... maybe you can, um, go around? (snapping) Lost a battery. Yes. Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? Gregoire, please. This is our truck! We need your vehicle. An urgent security matter. Of course sir. Yes, Gregoire, please. Let's not get into more trouble. Yes. Down to the last battery. Got about a minute left. (whispering): OK. (sparking) Sir, we're out of power. (gunshot) (grunt) (gunshots) Shoot. Help me. Where are they? On the right. Shoot. (groan) (gunshots) Let's go. Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! (engine revving) Go, go, go! (thud) (yelling) (thumping) (distorted screaming) (heavy breathing) (soft jazz plays) (knocking) Not now. Sir, it has taken me a long time to live down spying on Sinclair for you, but I won't let you do this. Do what? You're using his name. You've never trusted him and now that he's gone, you are trying to bring him down. (chuckling) How is that funny? Do you have any idea who knows where Colonel Sinclair is right now? I assume the general, the BSO? If the general and the BSO were to find out that a man of his standing, the leader of this entire outfit, had flown off into enemy territory to extract a single agent, what do you think they would do to him? No one knows. How could they? Sinclair is sending them status reports. Updates. Every two hours. You're protecting him. Why? Would you like a drink? The Mayhews have served for centuries. We're buried at the Plains of Abraham. Gallipoli. And my family feels sorry for me. They think I'm pushing paper. They have no idea what we do. They probably never will. We only have each other, Breeland. (clink) It's Tom. He's back. Where? The infirmary. Right, we'll go over the plans for Offlag 24 in the morning. There's still some work to do. But for now, dismissed. (crickets chirping) (quietly): You're not dead. (short breaths) Don't look at me. Don't look at me, please. It's OK, mate. It's OK. Don't! Please. I just... (crying): I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (stifled sobs) (whimpering) He's been held captive for three months. Announcer : On the next  X Company... Did you give them names? I don't... Our French networks? What did you tell them? I can't remember. Before you were taken, did Aurora have the shot? Hands up. Say what you have to. Announcer : X Company, next Wednesday at 9:00 on CBC.
