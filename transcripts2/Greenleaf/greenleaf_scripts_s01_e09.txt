 Previously on Greenleaf. 
 He took me out to the church's camp. He said he was just going to teach me how to fish. 
 You need to stay out of my way. 
 I mean it. 
 Get out of my office now. 
 You start pulling threads to get to me, girl, you're going to unravel the whole thing. 
 What exactly did the auditor say? 
 She wants our personal income taxes, complete with receipts, for the last three years. 
 When were you going to tell me? 
 After they put me in prison? 
 I should go. 
 Sometimes I wonder if he isn't still holding a torch for Grace. 
 Well, pardon my lapse of loyalty, but no. 
 After a thorough investigation into the fatal shooting of 16-year-old Kenneth Collins, the grand jury has declined to bring criminal charges... 
 Like I said. 
 Grace :  This is a surprise. 
 I thought you'd be halfway to Delaware by now. 
 Yeah, well, you got me thinking. 
 For my brother. 
 Oh, my God!

 ♪ Amen, amen, ooh. ♪ Sneed :  I've been to a lot of funerals,  but that had to be the most moving take on John 14 I've ever heard. Wouldn't you agree, Pastor? It was very good. The way the bishop took verse 9 and he just made you really feel the sorrow of Jesus and how Philip hadn't recognized God in him... I'll be honest, I didn't know Officer Nelson well during his time here, but I really felt his presence this morning. I'm going to have to get Bishop to give me a copy of that one for my files. I'm sure he'd be happy to share it with you. You knew David pretty well, didn't you? I wouldn't say well. Do you know what, Thomas? I got to get ready for this deacon board meeting. At 10:30 in the morning? It's an emergency. Pastor, if I was ever able to overcome my own natural modesty  and put myself up for the deacon board... You'd have my vote, Thomas. I just might do it after all. Thank you. Sykes :  I mean, I don't know about all of you, but my phone's been ringing off the hook since Sunday. Mine as well, Connie. Mine as well. With people saying what? Is it safe to come back to the church? Are we going to continue to be targeted by these people? We weren't targeted. David Nelson was targeted... by one man. But you made a point of supporting the police, Bishop,  all on your own. And now, if there's anyone else out there  still angry about that, what's to stop them from loading up a gun and walking into the church and shooting... I agree with Connie. It's up to Bishop what we do, but we've got to do something. I do not want to be a sanctified sitting duck. Amen. I want armed security patrolling that parking lot. I want armed security inside the doors of that tabernacle. I thought it was up to me, dear. Well, I'm just making suggestions. Here's my feeling. Now, I've prayed about this fervently for the past few days, and what the Lord's been saying to me loud and clear is this is a time for peace. Amen. Peace through strength. I mean, I don't understand what the problem is. You own a gun yourself. I know I have one, a place where our shield and our strength, Listen, if you think Basie Skanks is a thorn in your side,  just let one more person be shot at this church. Mac, don't you agree? I think the liability issues are tricky, but I'm not flat-out opposed to guns in the church. The Bible also says there's a time for war. That's right. Pastor Greenleaf? You must have an opinion on this. Oh, Lord, here we go. I don't, actually. I... I think it's complicated. Brother Kendall? I have a friend in law enforcement down in Orlando. He attends a church out there. Ever since the murders in Charleston, he began conducting self-defense seminars for churches. How to disarm a gunman. How to handle a hostage situation. Now, it may not address the gun or no gun issue, but it might make people safer in the meantime. Feel safer. I want to be safer. Do you think this friend of yours would come and give us a presentation? I'll give them a call. You do that, and we'll adjourn. Bishop. Hey, you got a second? Sure, sure. Isabel's mom came into town last night, so my office is ground zero for all things wedding related. As it should be. Wow. How you doing? I'm all right. I haven't told anyone anything, if that's what you're wondering. I'm not, but thanks. So, what's up? I just want to ask you, you have all the evidence you need to go to the police about Mac, right? Yeah. I've been emailing with Danielle and Vida, getting them prepared for their statements, so... I was just waiting until after this memorial was over today. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Me, too. It wasn't your fault. I wasn't uninvolved. He only came to church because I said... He came to church because he wanted to. It wasn't your fault. Thanks. I really just want to know what your timeline is. Isabel and I have all these folks pouring into town for the wedding starting tomorrow. You want me to wait until after the wedding to go to the police? No, I wouldn't ask you to do that. I just want to prep Izzie in case you were planning on doing it today. Where are you guys honeymooning? Maui. That always was your dream, wasn't it, Hawaiian honeymoon? Yeah, I guess it was. That's great. Dream's coming true, huh? Anyway, what's your plan? I can hold off. I'm not asking you to. No, no, it's all right. I waited a whole week. A few more days are not going to hurt anything. Mac's not going anywhere. Enjoy your wedding. It's all good. Grace? Yeah? Thank you. You got it. Now, I thought April was shellfish season down there. Marlin, too, now and bigeye. I wish we could come with you. Ever since Cuba opened up, we wanted to check it out. Morning, Karine. Mm-hmm. Bishop :  Come in. Hey! I was just thinking about you. Yeah? What a powerful thing it was for you to admit your uncertainty back at that board meeting. Really? It felt kind of inadequate. Oh, no. I liked it. Is Mac taking a vacation? To Cuba, yeah. Some big expedition. When is he going? After the ceremony. For how long? Two weeks. Why? Will you help me keep him here? Why would I want to do that? Charity :  Kevin? Are you in there? Hey, did you not hear me? No. No, um, what'd you say, babe? Nothing. Charity and Carlton :  ♪ Every long-lost dream ♪ ♪ Led me to where you are ♪ 
♪ Others who broke my heart ♪ 
♪ They were like northern stars ♪ 
♪ Pointing me on my way ♪ 
♪ Into your loving arms ♪ 
♪ This much I know is true ♪ 
♪ True ♪ 
♪ That God blessed the broken road ♪ 
♪ That led me straight to you... ♪ What's the matter? Nothing, I'm just, uh, this song... Charity, honey. Just give me a minute. Hormones. Woman on speaker :  And then what happened? He held me down. I couldn't breathe. I begged him not to do it. Turn it off.  He wouldn't stop. She was just about to say exactly how Mac violated her. I can guess what she was about to say, Gigi. I have emails from her, from Darlene's daughter... I don't need any more evidence. We can't let him leave town. You want me to sit at a table with that man for the next three days knowing what he did to my daughter? I have known for 20 years. All right. All right. I'll talk to him. Mac : Tennessee state? You got a minute? Yeah, sure. Thank you. I need you to postpone this trip. My ticket's nonrefundable. Well, I'll pay for the ticket. I paid for those charters, too. I'm not getting that back. I'll buy you a boat. Just stay. Why, though? I mean, I'm happy to. I just think we need to hammer this gun thing out before it gets messy. What do I have to do with that? Noah's karate guy is coming here. I want to know that we're properly insured in case one of our people brings a gun next week to protect themselves... and kills somebody. It happens. All right. I'll stay. Thank you. He's never around. He's always at the gym or out for a run, and when he's home, he's on the phone. What is he doing on the phone? Ask him. Just ask him. I want to, but I'm scared. Of what? That he'll tell me the truth. That he'll say there's, um... there's another woman. Oh, another woman? What if there is one? There's only one way to find out. Come on. Woman :  Well, there's still so much to do. Excuse me, ladies. Oh, Mac, this is Jocelyn Edwards, Isabel's mother. This is my brother Robert McCready. Everybody calls me Mac. Can I tear you away? Oh, listen, I was just about to take her out to the house. It'll just take a minute. All right, then. I will find you all in Noah's office... Okay. ...once I'm released. What's the matter? James just came and asked me to delay my fishing trip to Cuba. Did you know anything about this? No. Did he tell you why? Give you a reason? No, he just said he wanted me to stay and handle this gun business, but there's nothing legal to do. So, what did you tell him? Well, that I'd reschedule, of course. You know I live to serve, but I'm hoping you might talk to him and make it so I don't have to. I mean, he's all worked up about it. Huh. He's probably being extra careful because Noah's leaving. Keep the ticket. I'll talk to him. Okay. Thanks. I'll get back to it. Why do we even need to tell Mama? Because if what you say is true about those scholarships, Gigi, we'll have to get the man to confess everything. Not just the assaults, but the whole rest of it. If not, he'll drag this whole church down with him. And your mother's the only one that can get him to confess. (phone buzzing) (groans) Who is it? Sophia's dad. I'll call him back. I know this feels like a trial after the way we shut you down the first time... No, no. but you're going to have to deal your mother into this one. Deal me into what? Woman on speaker :  and When did you find out you were pregnant? Danielle :  Three months after it happened. Woman :  And you're certain Mr. McCready is the father of that child? Danielle :  Yes, I've never been with anyone else. Is that all? What do you mean, is that all? You need more? You heard what she said. Eve heard the snake in the garden, and aren't we glad she listened? I'm going to see my brother. About what? I want to hear his side of all this. She shouldn't tell him. Mae, there is no other side. What the girl is saying is true. What Vida's saying is true. Says who? You? Gigi? Danielle Turner? I don't know that girl. Her mouth ain't no prayer book. And Vida? Well, God bless Darlene, but we all know she wasn't raised right. I am going to talk to the only human being who supposedly was there for all these scenes. I will not have him tried in absentia. And your blind spot when it comes to this girl will be your undoing. You mark my word, James, because she's a handservant to the father of lies. (door closes) You're going to have to tell Jacob. She obviously won't listen to you. And the way things are between her and me since you're back,  she won't listen to me. Jacob's her prince. Lord knows why. Hey, hey. Bad news. What? You have to tell Isabel. Why? What happened? My mother just found out and it's... I'm sorry. I tried. I have to go explain the whole thing to Jacob now. Okay, thanks for telling me. I'm sorry. What are you doing on that phone all the time? That's all I want to know. Just show me the phone. Seriously? Yes! Show me the phone. What don't you want me to see? All right, somebody's hungry. Oh, don't do that. Well, you're eating for three now. Give me the phone, Kevin. No, Charity. Yes! No! Give me the phone! No, Charity. I'm not going to play into this. Stop! God! Listen, you're in a mood. I know you are. This whole wedding got you thinking about how we were when we first got married. We were all romantic, and you think that it's not that romantic anymore. It's not! Well, maybe it's not for you. And maybe I'm sorry about that. But let me tell you something. I feel more romantic about you and those two babies than the day we got married. Okay? Now, when you're ready to apologize, you know where you can find me. Yeah, at the gym. Excuse me. I was just helping that Turner girl. Yes, I paid for her abortion. I paid because her mother couldn't. And who was the father? Well, ask her. The hell if I know. 
 
 Mac! I'm sorry. I never asked. All right, so tell me about this Vida business. Okay. Now you're going to ask me about every woman I've ever known. Just Vida. Are we going to sift through 20 years now? You didn't want to get audited. I don't want to get audited. Tell me what happened with Vida. She wanted to quit high school and go to beauty school, and Darlene couldn't afford to send her. She came to me in secret. She knew I ran the scholarship committee. She asked me about the process. So, that wasn't hush money? For what? No! And so Vida's a liar? Yes. And Darlene is a liar? Yes! And Danielle Turner is a liar? Danielle Turner already admitted she's a liar, Mae. She recanted! Why didn't you tell me about this? Because I didn't want to bother you with it. Look what it's doing to us now. And it's all... it's all gossip. All slander. Mae, because of my work, because of my access to money and power, I'm involved with a lot of people. Half of them are women. And because they know I've got a good heart and because I'm a Christian, that makes me a target. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but even the Bible says Jesus made his bed with the poor and the outcast, and people talked! Leave Jesus out of this. You know what I'm saying! Leave Jesus out of this! You know what I'm saying! You remember what Mama used to say? Oh, now, come on. We're all we've got. You... are all I've got. You and James and this church. You really think I would weigh all that in my mind and do some mess like this to you? Well, maybe... Maybe what? Maybe your mind isn't right. Well, I don't know what to say to that. Say you didn't do it. That's what I've been saying the whole time. I did not do it. Any of it! Any of it! And that you never touched Faith. No, no. I loved her. I think about her every day. It's a crime that Faith is not here and Gigi's still here to trouble you like this. Oh, Lord Jesus. But you know. You know how it is. God takes the best for himself and leaves the rest of us to shift. Faith was the best. All right. I'm so sorry that I had to come to you with this. I'm glad you did. We'll get through this. I know we will. Mm-hmm. I'm sorry I didn't tell you every little detail of what was going on every day. No, I know. You handle things. Nobody knows that better than I do. You want me to talk to James? No. No. I'll deal with him, and I'll send him up here so y'all can make the peace man-to-man one last time. Oh. You do believe me, don't you? That's the thing. I do. I do. Okay. Settle down. I'm going to kill him. I mean it. I'm going to kill him. Jacob. What if he did this to Zora? I'm going to go kill him right now. Jacob, killing him isn't going to do the ten... twenty... whoever knows how many girls he did this to any good. This isn't about Mac. This is about them. This is about Faith. God! I just... feel so stupid. You told us back then. You said it all. I know, but Daddy didn't believe me. Mama didn't believe me. Yeah, yeah, I know, but I did... ...deep down. But I just... I just didn't say anything. You were just a kid. Come on. Is this why you came home? Unh-uh. No. But it's why I stayed. So, what do you say? You with me? Because it turns out you're the most important person in this family. Come on. Yeah, I'm with you. Come on. (giggling) (muttering) Hey. Jocelyn, would you give Isabel and me a minute? Oh, certainly. Our kid's going to be so much cuter than my brother's. Yikes! Hey, I need to tell you something. What's the matter? (knocking on door) Come in. Here are the items you requested. Is this all the women who got the First Lady's scholarship? Yes, sir, and a little bit about what each of them did with the money, supposedly. How many of them are there? 150. Janice Turner in here? And Vida, yes, sir. Thank you. How many others were there? We don't know, but we're going to find out. I feel so ashamed, Bishop. Darlene... I know it was wrong to take that money. Darlene. Life is so short and so strange, and, God forgive me for saying so, so hard for so many. Anyone who finds a safe place to rest in it can't be faulted for sometimes thinking it might be better to just let some things be. But you blame yourself for what happened to Faith. I see it. Yes, I do. That's right. And I do, too, for my Vida. What you said, that kind of thing is true for other people, but it's never true for yourself. You might be right. I could've done better. It's okay for you to tell me that. It's the truth. It's okay. Darlene, God bless you. God bless you, too, First Lady. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You know, if we had known, we never would have let... I know, I know. I'll leave you two be. What did he say? That he didn't do it? That this is some conspiracy? Do you remember when she was little, at bedtime, she'd... she'd say, "Love you. Be careful. Take care. Good night." Every night the same. Yeah. And that same little angel had to be... I know. What are we going to do? We're going to get through tonight. And we're get through this wedding. And then we're going to drag that sumbitch down Monday morning down to the jail and lock his ass up. Forever. Lord have mercy. Well, he has Mrs. Farmer but in order to pay your rent, we'd have to get that information from you today, so... Yeah. Yeah, well, you're very welcome. I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer. I have to go, okay? All the time. Hi.  Hey. Well, where's your worse half? I actually asked him if I could talk to you alone. I just thought it'd be easier. About what? Noah told me about Mr. McCready. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. No, no. I am. For what? Ever since you got back, Grace, I've been feeling like something was... would happen. With what? I don't know. Obviously, you two meant a lot to each other,  so I just thought something... Oh, no. I know, but it's how I felt. And recently, you two were spending so much time together, so I just felt like something was going to happen. But then he told me about Mr. McCready,  and so I get it, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I've been unfriendly. I was just feeling insecure. I totally understand. And you didn't have to explain it to me,  so, thank you. No, thank you. Grace, what did you think I wanted to talk to you about? I didn't know. Oh. There's the hotel, and there's the bungalow. Oh, right on the beach. Yeah, you can just walk right out and jump in. Mom, can you give us a moment? Honey, is something the matter? No. It is absolutely beautiful, Noah. The two of you are going to make wonderful memories there. Hey. Did you sleep with Grace? Why would ask me that? I'm giving you one chance to tell me the truth, Noah. Did you? If you tell me the truth right now, just admit you made a mistake. We can move forward. But I cannot go into this marriage with a lie. Did you sleep with her? Thank you for not lying to me. I didn't say anything. You didn't have to! You know what? You two... you two, you deserve each other, you know that? Isa... Take that. I don't want it. Isabel... Don't call my name. Don't say my name. I don't want to marry Grace. I want to marry you. Really? You have a really interesting way of showing that, Noah. Isabel... Don't say my name. You know, I knew we should've left this place when she came back. I knew you were too weak, but I waited. I waited because I believed in you! You can tell everyone at the mansion that the wedding's off. These people aren't my problem anymore. Have I done something wrong? No. Honey, you haven't done anything wrong. Your dad and I just need to ask you a few questions. Are you and Uncle Mac close, princess? Close how? He's my uncle. Well, what Dad means is do you and Uncle Mac spend time together that we don't know about? I see him around sometimes, yeah. Like where? Here at the house or at church. So, you've been spending time with Uncle Mac you haven't told us about? Kerissa :  Jacob. Can I be honest? Really honest? Please. That's all we're asking, sweetheart. You two are freaking me out. Mom ordered pizza. Dad keeps calling me princess. You both said I could watch TV. Do I have brain cancer? No, no. You don't have cancer. So, what's going on? There's been a little scare and we just want to make sure we have all the facts before we... Jacob :  Um, has...  has Uncle Mac ever... ever touched you in a way that makes you uncomfortable? Why? Is he a perv? Answer the question, baby. No, he hasn't. What happened? Okay. Well, we'll tell you soon, I promise. I'm 16. Go. Watch TV. Go watch TV. Thank you. I will do just that. And for now, just keep this between us, okay? Who else would I tell? Promise not to tell anyone I told you. I promise. Did he ever try anything with you? Not really. A few months ago, I sat next to him in Granddaddy's car on the way home from some huge dinner in Millington, and his hand was beside my leg, like, touching my leg. And he kept it there. He didn't move it. So, I slid over. That's weird, right? Yeah. He didn't try anything with you, did he? No, but he seemed really nice. I think that's how it works. Faith on speaker :  I mean, just being in God's presence, hanging out with God, it'll help us to figure out how to forgive those imperfect people and love them just the way they are. This life God's given us is not about perfection. It's about love. (beeping) (whirring) (sighs) You were going to just leave? I was trying to give you two some space. There is no "us two" anymore. The wedding's off. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. Just tell me one thing. Did you do it on purpose? No. I didn't say anything. She figured it out on her own. All I want is for you to be happy. This is the day the Lord has made. Beautiful day. Yeah. Mac : Get you a water or something? No, I'm good, thanks. What you got there, James? I used to keep this at home by the bed. After what happened last Sunday, I brought it to church. I didn't tell anybody. Just thought I might need it. Mae wasn't able to convince you. You didn't convince her. You're still here, Darlene? I just wanted to say thank you. You're making this place better. Grace, the Lord brought you back here, and I know it hasn't been easy for you, but you did it. Thank you. Put him away. I'm trying. Pastor Greenleaf? Not now, Thomas. It's a small thing. Whatever it is, I just can't. It's a small essay about my faith journey. Thomas, will you leave me alone? I can't help you. I can't save you. I can't get you on the deacon board. Just leave me alone. Karine, do you know where the bishop is? I don't know. You never had a child, did you? Not that I know of. I have to believe that that's part of what makes you do what you do. I haven't... done anything. Please, don't lie anymore. James. You never knew that feeling of making a person... of being a partner with God and making a person... ...and wanting nothing but good things for that person... ...knowing that you couldn't... you couldn't protect her from everything, that you have to let her go and make it on her own. James, I never touched her. (hammer clicks) Stop lying! Now! ♪ Satan ♪
