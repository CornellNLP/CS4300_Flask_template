 Previously on "Greenleaf"... 
 Jacob is having an affair with Alexa. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You texted the wrong person. 
 As minister of music, I'm well within my rights to ask you to modify the order of worship. 
 Just let me know what song my choir should sing as it crashes down, and then I'll pick up the pieces. 
 Here it is, son. 
 You're not ready for leadership. 
 What do you mean? 
 I'm setting you down. 
 Who's going to preach on third Sundays? 
 I'll find somebody. 
 Have you given any more thought to my request? 
 I can do it. 
 Oh, praise God. 
 I won't preach. 
 We'll see about that. 
 One thing, though, Daddy. 
 The first thing I'm going to do is start a small group for the victims of sexual abuse. 
 Woman :  My dad hated me before I was even born. 
 He was mad at my mom for getting pregnant with a second child when he couldn't afford the first. 
 He always held that against me. 
 When I was eight, my mom divorced him. 
 And then she met Keith. 
 One night, we were all sitting in the living room watching a movie. 
 Mom was snoring on the couch, and I was sitting on the floor. 
 And he said I could, like,  lean against his legs. 
 The way he said it, it sounded like something normal, So I did it. He massaged my shoulders,  the back of my neck. And because my mom and sister were right there,  I thought it was okay. I didn't know what good dads were supposed to be like. Thank you. That took a lot of courage. It wasn't courage. Ever since I heard you were starting this program, I felt like I had an apple stuck in my throat. I knew I had to come just to, you know, get it out. If you ever need anything, anything at all... Stacy, let's go. Come on, now. I'll see you next week. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. ♪ Amen ♪ 
♪ Amen ♪ (vocalizing) ♪ Well ♪ (vocalizing) ♪ Amen, amen, ooh. ♪ Well, I still think I prefer "The Wizard Of Oz." This whole mania for seeing the supposed good in bad people, it's just decadence. Thank you. (exhales) I'm due to preach in Birmingham Sunday. Already? My word. The months just fly by like weeks. I was thinking of having Gigi cover for me. Oh, at Birmingham Baptist? No, no. Right here at Calvary. Why would you ever do that? I can't be in two places at once. No, James, why would you invite someone who is so obviously at odds with the church, your family? She's not that at odds. The Sisters Of Tamar? It's a fine idea for a small group. James, that group is nothing but a slap in our face, and you know it. And then you want to let her get up in front of everyone and say what? Whatever the Lord gives her to say. Just reinstate Jacob and be done with it. It's not like you haven't been human. James, you have to forgive Jacob for his failings at least as much as you've forgiven yourself. You're not planning on reinstating Jacob ever, are... When Jacob shows me that he understands the meaning of the position, I'll be happy to reinstate him. Are you? Mae! If Gigi hadn't left, this whole notion of Jacob in the pulpit would never have arisen. He'd have found his natural place. Where? What doghouse would he be sleeping in if I hadn't forced you from the day that Grace left here to bring him in out of the rain? I don't know what kind of work... that that boy is genuinely suited for,  and neither does he. But if we have one chance to set things right and get Gigi back in the pulpit, that's what we're going to do. At whose expense? Jacob's? Mine? Are you trying to start a war? No. I'm trying to end one. Are you coming to bed? In a while. I'm just trying to finish up some stuff. More fantasy football. Why do you waste your time with that? It's not a waste of time. When I was out at Deion's bachelor party, he introduced me to a friend of his. A friend. Yeah. What's her name? Greg. (chuckles) He's the new head of development  out at Voice of Life in Birdsong. I've been talking fantasy football with him as a way to, you know, get in the door to have a conversation with him about putting Daddy on TV. Want to keep on looking like that now? Okay. He and his wife are coming over tomorrow night to talk about it if that's all right with you. I didn't know. I'm sorry. I told Nigel about this idea I had for an arrangement. You know the song "Praise You"? Fatboy Slim. Yeah. I love that. The way he looked at me, you would've thought I'd killed his cat. You should just fire that joker. He'd go straight over to Triumph. Basie's been wooing him for years. Well, let them have each other. Don't you have a pile of résumés  you've been collecting over the years for every time you got all mad at Nigel and had to post that job? Nigel's really good, though. Yeah, but he's not good for you. Cut him loose. It would be better for everybody. Why be unhappy? And I know Latonya's gonna do a fantastic job with that solo. Nigel. She has a way with 12/8. I told her, me? I'm better with the boogie. Nigel. Nigel! I don't want Latonya singing any more solos this year. I know you ladies think that she's flat. We don't think she's flat, Nigel. Both : She's flat. Charity, you pick the songs. I've learned to live with that. Nigel, I don't want to hear Latonya singing that solo this Sunday. Then maybe you'd rather hear her from a great distance, say, across town? You mean at Triumph? I didn't say Triumph. But now that you bring it up, I will say Pastor Skanks has offered me complete artistic control. Then take it. Pardon me? Take it, Nigel! Pastor Greenleaf, you got a minute? Please. What's that you got there? Stories from the women in my support group. The ones who won't talk, they write. Some of them won't even write. Well, it's good they have you feeling their pain like this. You know, that's the Lord in you, you know, caring. I'm totally unable to go back and stop any of it from happening. That's the Lord, too, mourning that sad fact. This is ministry. It's nice to see you coming along. What did I do now? I want you to preach on Sunday. Now, I know our deal was that you weren't going to preach. But our sister church in Birmingham, they count on hearing from me every third Sunday. So, reinstate Jacob. No. But I'll be happy to tell your mother that you and she finally agree on something for once. Daddy. All the best seats at God's table are filled with reluctant saints. I don't want to preach again. What is this dug-in position that you've taken against preaching? It's not what I came home to do. Well, you're the associate pastor, and I can't be here, so you're going to do it. Carry on. So... What happened? Aunt Charity just texted, and I'm going to be singing a solo Sunday in church. Baby, congratulations. Come here. That's great. Good, good. Maybe you could preach the sermon for me, too. Or sing it, huh? What's the book? Oh, it's something Thomas Sneed gave me when he heard that I was preaching on Sunday. "Sermon Helps For Busy Servants." Mm-hmm. I think he has a crush on you. Oh, no. He has a crush on my job, and I wish they'd run away together. Aren't you even a little bit excited to preach again? No. Why not? It seems like it would be a lot of fun to get up there and just say whatever you want. But it's not saying whatever you want. That's not what it's like. Then what is it like? It's kind of like having somebody else talking through you. That doesn't sound so bad. No, it's not. Not in and of itself. It's just a question of... what's worth letting that person in and, really, what isn't. Okay, well, I am just glad to have you be the one with homework for a change. Thank you. Good luck. Thanks, Mom. How many people every Sunday? 4,000. But we've actually got sister churches in Birmingham, Little Rock, and Knoxville. So, you know, that's a ready-made audience. And he's written books, too, right? Absolutely. As a matter of fact, I'll send you some. That'd be great, something to show to my people at the network. Don't let us interrupt. No, please interrupt. Please, we've been missing you ladies. Aww. This looks amazing. Careful, it's hot. I'm sure. What is it? Portobello mushroom and goat cheese. It's something my mother always used to make for company. Mmm. Baby, you've got to get this recipe. And the staff to cook it as well. Don't be fooled. You have to teach them how to do everything. Sometimes I think it'd be easier if I just did it myself. Where you from, Kerissa? Houston. I love Houston. Nobody loves Houston. No, I do. They have an art collection down there... The Menil. That's it. I love that place. That's my favorite. (whispering) So, Jacob, what's it like to live in the same house as your parents? Terrible. Seriously? I thought it would be a good place for the kids. Oh, yeah. You know, I was just kidding. Woman :  You're so silly. Charity :  Oh, God. What's the matter? It's so hard to choose. Between what, babe? Candidates for Nigel's job. I mean, not even someone to hire, just someone to meet. Everybody's got all these files to listen to and these super long statements. Well, don't take it so seriously. What if I end up with another Nigel? Who cares? It's just an interview. Okay, look, look. Let's have some fun with it. Put the maybes to the right, nevers to the left. Go. Based on what, though? Whatever. You know, the picture if they have one. Name? Just go for it. Like one of those dating apps? Yeah, you know, I guess. Okay. Maybe. Never. Oh. Nah, nah, nah. Don't slow down. Just do it. Maybe. Uh, never. Ooh, never. Never. Maybe. There, I have respected and disrespected two sets of humans I know nothing about. Well, half won't know and the other half won't care. Now, let me get these no-account losers out of the way for you, and who do we have on top over there? Carlton C. Cruise. Carlton C. Cruise. Give him a call. What? Yeah, I mean, it's just an interview. It's not like you got to marry the guy. Okay. Thank you. You got it. I'm so glad we're already married and we don't have to deal with this stuff. What stuff, babe? Dating apps. It seems so lonely. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got it in just under the wire. (knock on door) So sorry to wake you. Oh, no. You didn't wake me. I mean, you did, but I fell asleep reading, so... You want to... - Oh, this won't take a second. What's the matter, Mama? You're preaching this Sunday. Yeah. That wasn't my idea. Oh, I know whose idea it was, and I just wanted you to know, dear, in case it ever occurred to you to doubt it at all, you have my complete support. Thank you for letting me know. I still remember, you know? Just like it was yesterday. You were five years old when you recited your first Easter piece  in front of the church. Do you remember? Um, Jesus appearing before Mary? John 20. And everybody walked up to your father and me afterwards, and they said, "Ooh, that is one talky child." And we were so proud. So, I guess what I want to say... ...is that I hope it's your intent to use the authority of the pulpit on Sunday for institutional purposes and not as a switch to punish us publically. That would be such a cruel thing to do... to your father, especially in his absence. Don't you agree? Mama? Yes, dear? Do you love me at all? What a ludicrous question. No, it's a real question. Do you love me? Of course I love you, Grace. I also love your father,  and I love this church. And I just hope that you approach this opportunity with the appropriate humility, that's all,  for your sake. Do you understand? Yeah. Then I'll let you be. Good night, dear. Good night. Jacob, your beautiful lady distracted me. I'm not complaining, but I feel we didn't even get a chance to talk about the pitch for the show. Oh, it's all good. We'll find some time maybe next week over lunch, just you and me. I've got a better idea. You all good, baby? Yeah. All good for what? We just bought this beautiful place over in Birdsong. It's a cabin in the woods, only 3,000 square feet. We've got a hot tub on the deck... lots of room. We can make a night of it. You mean, like, stay over? You and I could get lit, brainstorm about what your daddy's show could be. Let these lovely ladies soak in the tub underneath the stars. With no parents around, of course. That's right. No parents to see the mischief we all might get up to, you know what I'm saying? Think about it. I want to hammer out this pitch and get it done. Me, too. Fantastic. Well, it's past our bedtime, so we'll see ourselves out. It was great meeting you. You, too. You, too. All right, thank you. All right. Night. Drive safely. We'll be in touch. What the hell was that? Whoa. What do you think you're doing? 
 
 Hey. Pastor? Hey. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Thank you. So few people return books nowadays. I have to confess, I've come to think of it  as a minor miracle when it happens. What are you going to preach about? I'm not sure yet. I probably should be, considering it's tomorrow, huh? No, no. I preach every Wednesday night at the group home on my block, as a blessing to the young folks there. Pastor, that's great. And the Lord always gives me something to say, and it's almost always at the last minute. It could be He shows me something in a movie I'm watching online. Or it could be something someone says when they don't even know they're being used by the Lord to provide the seed for my message. Yeah. Or it could be a leaf falling from a tree. But He is always on... Brother Kendall, come on in, please. Sorry to barge in. Grace, there's someone in your office. Excuse me, Pastor. Thank you. It's Stacy. She's beaten up pretty badly. She's in your office right now. What? Yeah, I think it was her husband. I just feel awful. Look, you can't control what everyone's going to do. You just keep telling the truth and encouraging others to do the same. Look, you're doing the right thing. Thank you. Stacy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so sorry. It's going to be okay. (sobbing) I understand. Thanks. So, what's the deal? Well, unfortunately, the woman's shelter we work with is full right now. Is there any space here tonight? Not really. We're hosting men from Shelter from the Storm. Now, I could put in a call to county. I can't take my kids to county. Last time we went there, the woman in the bunk below us had a cough. She barked all night long. The kids got sick. I got pneumonia. I can just go home. No, no. Oh, no, no, no. You're not going back there. We'll figure something out. Yeah. I was a P.K., you know? Oh, just like me, obviously. It's a calling. Yeah, I grew up singing and playing in my father's church and I have some very fond memories of being in the youth choir and singing "Jesus, Be A Fence." Oh, I love that song. What? ♪ Jesus, be a fence all around me ♪ 
♪ Every day... ♪ That's right. ♪ Jesus, I want You to protect me ♪ 
♪ As I travel along the way ♪ 
♪ I know You can ♪ 
♪ Yes, Lord ♪ 
♪ I know You will ♪ 
♪ Yes, Lord ♪ 
♪ Fight my battles if I just keep still ♪ 
♪ Yes, Lord ♪ 
♪ Lord, be a fence all around me every day. ♪ Yeah! That was fun! Amen. I can't remember the last time I had fun with my choir director. Oh, well, that's a shame. The way I see it, the choir director is like the vibe manager of the church. I mean, if you can't have fun with your choir director, then no one's having fun. I like you. I like you, too. Mavis : I don't know why you called. I'm glad you did. It sure is nice getting away from that club for a few minutes. I tell you, sometimes I look up from my work and I think if the Lord is still looking out of these eyes, He sure is bored. I'm sure He is. Looking out, that is. So, what's going on, James? Gigi's preaching tomorrow. Preaching? Seriously? 11 AM, if you're interested. This is her idea? No, no. I asked her to do it. And what does Mae have to say about this? She's characteristically ecstatic. But what I wanted to know is, when I asked her to do it, she said no. Then when I asked her why she was so set against it, she said that's not what she came home to do. Do you know what she meant? What did she come home to do? You know. No, I don't, though I really... Yes, you do. You know, and that's why you called me. That's why you came by here to see me, to let me know you know. What? Well... Whenever I'm with you like this, it occurs to me that, well, maybe I missed my life. You know, like a train. Did I miss it? Trains leave the station every day, James. You just got to get off. Okay, then, if you need anything else, just call me. Otherwise... I don't need to know anything else. No? No. You're hired. Oh, don't tell me you have other offers on the table. I'm not going to let the best meeting I have ever had... No, no, no, no. It's not that. So, what's the problem? There's something that you should know before you pull that trigger. Okay. I wasn't completely up front about myself in my last two jobs, and it caused problems later. And I just want to put all my cards out on the table, full disclosure. I'm gay. That's no problem. Are you sure? Because I have a partner and he'd be coming to church. That's fine. I just want that music and this... this thing that we've got going here. Okay, then. Praise God. Okay, come tomorrow at 10:30 and I will show you around. It's a date. (cell phone ringing) (ringing) Greg, what's up? Yeah. Uh-huh. (whispering) I'm sorry I couldn't go to county. I just couldn't do it again. They have a way of making you feel like you're a criminal being there. I'm just glad you guys are safe. (television chatter) Can I ask? What happened? Yeah, if you want to tell me. When I got home, Cole asked me what we talked about in the meeting. I told him what I said about Keith. He said that wasn't anybody else's business, that I made myself look bad telling stories like that, that I made him look bad. You made  him  look bad? For being with me. He said I couldn't go back to group next week, and I said I was going to. I said I felt better now that I said something and... I promise I won't stay more than one night and I'll pay the church back as soon as I get some money. Stacy. Girls? Go brush your teeth. Stacy, come here. He hit you. You can't go back to that, not without him getting help. You can't do that. Come here. Sit down. I'm not saying you should break up. I'm just saying don't go back. Not yet, anyway. You can't. I know you think I'm weak. No, I don't think... It's just that I grew up without a father and I put myself through hell trying to find a way to fill the hole that missing piece left inside me, you know? I don't want my daughters to grow up with that same missing piece. What if he hits them next time? He won't. I'm the one he's mad at. What if he hurts them to get back at you? You know that happens. Why are you trying so hard to help? You told your story. That's not easy to do. Don't go back, Stacy. Girl :  Mama? Excuse me. I got to... Zora and Winkie around? Zora's with Sophia and Winkie's in the kitchen with Annika, I think. Why? Greg called. He wants to know if we want to come over for dinner tonight. Oh. Yeah, let's do that. You know what he thinks is going to happen if we go over there, right? I have a pretty good idea. And you're okay with that? Will it get you that TV deal? It might. No guarantee. So, let's go. You messing with me? Not at all. You ever stepped out on me before? Jacob, Grace is preaching tomorrow. Who knows what your stock is going to be once she closes that Bible. We have to do something. All right. I'll call him and tell him. Okay. I'll have my mom take Winkie for the night. He'll like that, if that's all right with you. Fine with me. Fun. He likes Tasha Cobbs, Travis Greene. Sounds great. See? The guy was out there just waiting for you. Happy ending. Except one thing. What? Don't be mad. What is the problem? He's gay. How do you know he's gay? (cell phone ringing) He told me. (ringing) Uh... hello? Hey, I saw you called. Yeah, I pulled a few strings and got Stacy a placement at the Stanton House. Her and the kids can stay a month, free of charge. Oh, my God, that's amazing. I'm going to go back and tell her right now. Bye. So, he just told you he's gay. Yeah. Who does that in a job interview? Gay people? I knew you'd be mad. I'm not mad, it's just your daddy's not going to love it, that's for sure. Like Daddy didn't know about Nigel? Come on, everybody knew. Yeah, maybe they did, but, well, they put up with it because Nigel never... he never, you know, said it. I'm not going to not hire Carlton just because he's gay. I'm not saying not to hire him because he's gay. I'm saying don't hire because... What? Out? Isn't that better? Isn't it better to be honest? You can do what you want. I just think it's a mistake. You're the one who told me to make two piles and have fun with it. I know. Believe me, I know. Hello. Can I help you? Hi. Where are the people who were staying here, a woman and two kids? They checked out. Jacob, come on. I'm ready. Jacob, I said I'm ready to go. Jacob, I said I'm ready to go. What's wrong? Let's go. I don't want to. What about the TV deal? I don't care about it. You think you're going to get reinstated just by doing your time? Sorry, but after tomorrow, it's going to be much harder. You were right to come up with a good plan B. I won't have another man touching you. Why the hell not? You've been making a fool of me, Jacob, for years now, making me pay every day for the one mistake that you will not forgive, that... I love you. And judging by your behavior, I don't matter to you at all. So, Jacob, why the hell would it matter to you if some other man touched me? Because you're mine. After all you've done? I didn't say I was perfect, woman. I just said you're mine. You sure you don't want to come to Birmingham with me, darling? Maiden voyage on your new jet. No, thank you. Mae. What? Do you think I don't know what you're doing? I know you better than you know yourself. What am I doing? You tell me. Come on. Come on. You're using Grace to punish me for Faith's death, but it is not my fault. I don't think it's your fault. Oh, yes, you do, and you just need to go on and at least admit it. I think... I think it's our fault. You should go. Stacy, this is Pastor Grace. Could you give me a call when you get a chance, please? Please. Hey, we are going to the kitchen. Ooh, bring me something back. Yeah, what do you want? Uh... nothing. What are you going to preach about? Did she tell you to ask me that? Inquiring minds want to know. Still waiting for a sign. When my dad gets stuck, he just downloads sermons off the Internet. I doubt that's true. It's true. They have whole sermons on there... 50 bucks. He just downloads them, prints them out, and reads them on the pulpit. Don't tell him I told you. Mum's the word. We'll bring you something good. Thank you. Oh, boy. (printer humming) Mae : Before I met Bishop, you know, I had dreams of being a singer. Mm, wow. Amen. Oh, excuse us, please. Oh, what a blessed sight. I prayed last night for some good news, and here it is. The both of you are just so happy, just like the old days. Lady Mae... Kerissa, I know Grace is preaching this morning, and aren't we all looking forward to that? But I have my own little message for you two. What's that? Let not your heart be troubled. About what? Anything. Believe in God and also in me. I have both your fortunes well in hand, and this storm will pass. Charity : The choir usually enters through this hallway, unless we're doing something special like Christmas, when we come down the aisle. Oh! Hey. Sophia's looking for you. Carlton, this is my husband Kevin. Heard a lot about you. Your wife is my new best friend. I hope that's going to be okay. Please, take her off my hands. Kevin is director of outreach. And soon to be daddy of two. Yeah, that's what she tells me. Well, those babies are going to be on the cover of something... "Baby Ebony," "Baby Essence"... because between the two of you, you have cornered the market on all sorts of human attractiveness. Thank you for being good. Come with me and I'll introduce you to your new favorite soloist. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. (choir singing) (music playing) ♪ By and by ♪
