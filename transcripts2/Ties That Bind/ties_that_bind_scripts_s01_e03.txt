 Hey babe, you hungry? 
 I think the locusts might have left you a few crumbs. 
 Yeah! I'll just grab a quick uh... 
 I didn't take the last slice. 
 Carb-free is healthier for you. 
 We have other carb-free options. 
 We have soup, salad, smoothie. 
 Sundae? 
 That's tempting, but no. I'll grab something at work. 
 Work? It's Saturday. 
 Saturday is the day of catching up. 
 For me that means paperwork. 
 As for the rest of you... 
 Your dad-slash-uncle has great plans in store for you. 
 That sounds horrible. 
 I want you to work hard, I want big appetites: I'm making family dinner tonight. 
 Yes! 
 Bye! 
 Alright, bye! 
 Wait, so my Saturday is no longer my own? 
 Yeah. 
 You and Mariah need to deal with that clothes closet. 
 We already did! 
 Yes, but it looks like you threw a stick of dynamite in there and walked away. 
 I built a rolling rack in the attic. 
 All the winter stuff can go up there. 
 Anything that hasn't been worn in six months goes to Goodwill. Be ruthless. 
 Boys, you're with me. 
 Are we being punished? 
 No, you're being given an opportunity to do some post-construction clean-up. 
 Aren't there some child labor laws? 
 I pay a fair wage. 
 Ten bucks an hour? 
 How 'bout fifteen? 
 How about five? 
 Ten works. 
 Hold on, why do they get paid? 
 Whatever change you find in the pockets of those jeans you're gonna clean, you can keep. 
 And why don't they have to do closets? 
 Because we goodwilled the first time Mom asked. 
 Retire to your respective corners, come out cleaning. 
 Don't all jump up at once. 
 Number four, that's definitely him. 
 You're sure? 
 Yeah, 100%. 
 And you'd swear to that in court? 
 Absolutely. 
 Thank you, Mr. Martin. 
 If you'd wait outside, we'll bring your wife in now. 
 We're ready for you! 
 Mrs. Martin, Do you see the man you found breaking into your home last night? 
 I do... number two. 
 Do you wear glasses or contacts, Mrs. Martin? 
 No, my vision is perfect. 
 Is there a problem, Lieutenant? 
 No. Thanks for taking the time to come down. 
 Detectives Hernandez and Lee will follow up with you. 
 Lieutenant, can I get a signature? 
 Didn't realize you're spending Saturday with us, McLean. 
 Hope yours is more productive. 
 That'll be all gentlemen, thank you for the assistance. 
 Even though that didn't assist. 
 Scooped up a guy for B and E, Mr. Martin ID's him no problem. 
 Mrs. Martin picks Lenny from processing. 
 Back to square one. 
 Reassemble the line. 
 What are you doing? 
 Number Four, step forward. 
 Even she picks the right guy. 
 That's the guy who shot me. 
 Get Devin in here. 
 No need, he didn't get eyes on him. 
 He won't be able to ID him. 
 Are you sure? It's been two years. 
 I will never forget that face. 
 Lieutenant, how do you want to play this? 
 Without a positive ID from the homeowners, can we even hold him? 
 We have to! 
 How long have you had him? 
 We picked him up around 8 AM. 
 We can hold him for today without ruffling feathers. 
 Even a bit more if his paperwork gets misfiled. 
 But if he lawyers up, we won't even make the day. 
 So we have 18 hours to prove that he's our shooter or he walks? 
 He is not walking. 
 This is priority one. 
 This man shot one of our own. 
 Nobody sleeps until we get an attempted murder charge that sticks. 
 I searched and searched for this face, and now Seattle has a file on him? 
 Vern Keeler, 43, no fixed address. 
 Multiple arrests, mostly drug related. 
 Oh and yes, his fix is oxycodone. 
 Why is the oxy relevant? 
 Harper Park was Oxy Central. 
 We were staked out by the parking lot grabbing photos to build a case for a sweep. 
 Yeah, oxy dealer. 
 We moved in to try to get clearer shots, but this is the best we got and we could never ID him. 
 As we're maneuvering to a better position, a guy in a hoodie walks right up, sticks a gun in the dealer's face. 
 Takes off with his pills and his cash. 
 So we move in, Hoodie Guy fires. 
 Next thing I'm waking up at Sisters of Mercy with a hole in my shoulder. 
 She flat-lined in the ambulance. 
 Lucky to be alive. 
 Now if Wilkes annoys me, I threaten to apply for death benefits. 
 So you're saying the guy in the hoodie is Keeler in holding? 
 Yeah, now we just have to prove it. 
 These photos aren't gonna help. 
 That could be him or it could be my mechanic. 
 What's his sheet look like? 
 Multiple felony arrests, including checking every box under theft and robbery. 
 All reduced or dropped to misdemeanors. 
 Clean file for someone so dirty. 
 He knows how to work the system. 
 When's the last time he got picked up? 
 Assault charge in Seattle on a minor league bottom-feeder named Wade Tilson. 
 Tilson declined to pursue. 
 Got a date on that? 
 Yeah, two years ago, November 28th. 
 That's three days after I was shot. 
 We gotta talk to this guy. 
 Keeler kept his nose clean since? 
 You'd go dark too if you were wanted for shooting blue. 
 Or head for another jurisdiction. 
 If we cross Keeler's mug shot with oxy arrests made in other states, we might track arrests made under a different alias. 
 On it. 
 Wait! 
 If we give that to a uniform, that frees you and Victoria to go to Harper Park and canvass the area with his picture. 
 The crowd doesn't change over much there. 
 They might be able to place him at the time of the robbery. 
 And we'll track down... what's his name? 
 Tilson. 
 Tilson and any other known associates. 
 I've got a current address for Tilson. 
 I'm betting he doesn't get out much. 
 We'll head to the park right now. 
 Okay. 
 You ready? 
 Almost. 
 Hello? 
 Hi... you got a minute? 
 Yeah baby, what's wrong? 
 I hate to do this to you, but we got a situation here. 
 I don't think I'll be home for a little while. 
 What is it? What's going on? 
 The guy who shot me is here. 
 In holding. 
 You got him? 
 No, the only thing connecting him to my shooting is my say-so. 
 So we're gonna have to build the case before the clock runs out. 
 Do whatever it takes to nail him. 
 No need to worry the kids. 
 Of course. 
 I don't know when I'm going to be home. 
 That's not a problem. 
 Baby, what matters is this guy pays. 
 Whatever you need, I'm here, okay? 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 Okay, bye sweetie. 
 You okay Dad? Was that Mom? 
 Yeah, it was. 
 She okay? 
 Yeah, she's fine. 
 She was calling to tell me to remind you to do everything I say. 
 And do it with a smile. Let's go! 
 We appreciate your taking time to pay us a visit, Tilson. 
 I'm always up for a change of scenery. 
 Especially when it's a nice view. 
 Hey, eyes here. 
 Recognize this guy? 
 Maybe. 
 Picture him with a bar stool in his hands and it's aimed at your head. 
 I wish that narrowed it down more than it does. 
 C'mon, we're smarter than that and so are you. 
 What were you two fighting about? 
 Oh man, I'm sorry. 
 My memory's kinda shot. 
 One too many bar stools, I guess. 
 Anything that might improve that memory? 
 Sunshine, you know what I'm saying? 
 Fresh air, a toilet with a seat. 
 I see you're being transferred next week. 
 Walla Walla, ouch. 
 Too bad it's not Larch Mountain. Real nice view there. 
 Maybe you could call that friend of yours in Operations, see if you can get Wade transferred to Larch Mountain instead? 
 Yeah, if only I could remember her name. 
 Memory's kinda shot. 
 His name's Vern Keeler. 
 Smart guy. 
 Smarter than I am, since I'm in and he's not. 
 He's a bad one, I'll tell you. 
 Nasty habits. 
 Such as? 
 Well, first pills. Then robbery, then both. 
 Harper Park, November 25th two years ago. 
 Vern tries to rob an oxy dealer... that you? 
 That why you two were flinging bar stools in Seattle three days later? 
 What fool would be in Harper Park at midnight? 
 One with a lousy memory. 
 I do remember one thing. 
 I saw on the news that a cop got shot. 
 A pretty woman cop. 
 And that's all I know. 
 We're done here. 
 Let's go. 
 Oh, I just remembered my friend's name in Operations. 
 Guess my memory's not as bad as I thought. 
 Bye, Wade. Enjoy Walla Walla. 
 You gonna make me testify? 
 It's got an ocean view. 
 Fine, but I'll need six months off this stint. 
 I'll need a present for the DA. 
 Keeler was running with this long-legged junkie girl. 
 She might know something. 
 Does the junkie girl have a name? 
 Cyndi. 
 With the Y and I backwards, know what I'm saying? 
 Last name? 
 She worked as a massage therapist out of the Imperial Cafe. 
 Girls like that ain't got no last names. 
 But a line on a girl like that... should earn a brother a nice view. 
 I'll let you know... if we find her. 
 He's all yours. 
 Thanks for the hard work, you guys. 
 Mrs. Belmont is going to love how well we cleaned up. 
 She is very particular. 
 Thanks for the chance to earn some cash, Dad. 
 No problem. 
 My money wants to go to the comic book store and look for the new Justice League of America. 
 Your money has good taste. What about you? 
 Console... game console. 
 Dude, we did not earn that much. 
 It all adds up. 
 Share the drawer. 
 Rachel : What if things get mixed up? 
 Mariah : I wouldn't be caught dead wearing any of yours. Girls, just work it out, or talk to Dad or your uncle, okay? Dad? It's the underwear drawer! When are you coming home? I don't know, okay? I gotta go. Work it out, okay bye. Here's my partner now. Hi. Your gorgeous friend here was just asking about our massage therapists. You two want a couple's deal? Not that kind of partner. Shelly, what can you tell us about a therapist who worked out of here a couple years back? Name's Cyndi. Long legs, bad taste in men. Well that's half the girls in here, so... She spelled it with the Y and the I backwards. Oh, right! From Minnesota, pretty smile and yeah, long legs. She have a boyfriend? No, she had an obsession. Did it look like this? Ugh, yeah that's him. Major creep. True romance? No, it wasn't love, it was oxy. That stuff gets hold of you and makes you stupid crazy. Yeah, it does. You still in touch with her? It's been a while. But this creep-o was here last week, looking for her. What did you tell him? I told him Minnesota. I doubt she's there, and there's no way I'm letting him drag her back down. You got any contact information on her? Phone number? Email? I wish I did. She cut us all off. They say people don't change, but she did. Cleaned up, even met a sweet guy on Christian Mingle, if you can believe it. A happy ending, there's a twist. I understand you want to protect her, but we really need to find her. Is she in trouble? Not with us... with him. Hold on. She always said she wanted a house with a beautiful garden. And this came last Christmas. It's the last I heard from her since she took off. Sometimes dreams do come true. Oak Park postmark. Looks better than it did on the internet. It looks even better because Cyndi's home. Excuse me. Excuse me! Mrs. Martin? It took me three months to get in to see this doctor. I can't be late. We just have a few questions. We wanted to follow up about Vernon Keeler. From the line up. I told you, it wasn't him. We never told you his name. So how do you know him? I have no idea who you're talking about. Then maybe you can help us find Cyndi? Maybe she knows who we're talking about? Shelly sends her best. Mr. Martin. Everything okay out here? Crestview PD, sir. We have a few follow-up questions for your wife. Did you charge the crook yet? We're very close. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. I have to go. The guy I picked out, he did it. Charge him. Thank you very much, sir. We'll get in contact with you shortly. Our only lead just froze us out. Hey. Thought you guys might be hungry. Thank you. For you, for the kids. Are you going to remember to eat? Yes. I'll take this to Pete and Victoria. How's it going? We are making progress, chasing the clock. That was sweet of you to bring us dinner. I'm fine, really. Okay. I'll get the burgers to the kids before they're cold. Let you get back to it. Okay. Love you. Love you, too. Lieutenant, do you have a contact in Corrections who could be persuaded to transfer Wade Tilson to Larch Mountain? Your imaginary friend in that imaginary department didn't have much pull? You brought her up and she got him talking. What testimony will that buy? Only that Keelers been rolling oxy dealers. Not that he was one. Tilson wants a six month discount along with the transfer. Does he want a feather bed too? And what about Mrs. Martin? Is there a way to press her? I don't see how. If she admits to a past with Keeler, her shiny new life blows up. Did she say why Keeler broke in? She won't even acknowledge she knows him. Nothing out of the canvass at Harper Park? Two years is an eternity on the street. So where does that leave us? Square one, with six hours down. Actually, square minus one. Keeler asked for a lawyer. Called Lev Ginsley. What? That's not gonna happen. Keeler's broke, Ginsley'll pass. No, he won't. If he can get Keeler off, he gets so much media play. If we make a deal with Tilson, Ginsley will know. He always knows. He'll tear him apart. Tilson's testimony will be useless. And even if the wife was talking, Ginsley on cross with a former junkie/hooker... toast. He's gonna walk. Let's take five and re-group. You might not care about getting in trouble with Matt, but I do. We will get this guy. 
 
 Mrs. Martin? Thank you for coming in. We didn't expect to see you again. It just wasn't the right time, y'know? Is it okay if it's just her? Not at all. Did you make it to your doctor's appointment? We're trying to have a baby. That's wonderful. How many kids do you have? Two, but you're not here to talk about me. Can we talk about Cyndi... and Vern Keeler? I can't believe that he found me. When Terry and I came home and Vern burst out of the kitchen and pushed right past... I thought my heart was going to stop. I never wanted to see him again. Is that why you threw the line-up? I was hoping that he'd just go away. That he'd know I helped him go free and he'd just disappear again and leave me alone. The best way to get him out of your life is to keep him in jail. But I need your help to do that. No, Terry can't know. Terry can't know that Vern and I used to... he can't know who I used to be. If he finds out, I will lose him. Your husband loves you. You won't lose him. No. You don't understand. I've made mistakes. A lot of mistakes. Was Vern one of those mistakes? He was one of the biggest. Him and the oxy. Sixteen pills a day. He always had what I needed, y'know? How long did you and Vern date? We didn't date. We hung out and got high. So were you hanging out two years ago, around Thanksgiving? Yeah. Yeah, we got in a fight because Shelly invited me over for turkey, but not him. Did you ever go to Harper Park together? All the time. Did you know a police officer was shot there that November? No. Vern didn't say anything about that? No. The bullet cut right through to the back of her lung. She has a husband who loves her, like Terry loves you. And two beautiful children. They almost lost her. You know who shot her? Vern Keeler. Vern shot you? We all have something from our past we want to forget. Something that haunts us. So you and I have the same ghost. You know, you're gonna have that baby. A family. You don't want that ghost haunting them too. So let's get rid of it. I thought you were cleaning your closet. We finished. Mostly. It's for Aunt Allison. Not you. She's having a bad day. So we're making her favorite. Hummingbird cake. I have bad days. How come no one bakes me a cake? Maybe if you weren't such a jerk all the time. Mom tell you what's going on? No, that's how I know it's bad. And a cake's gonna make it all better? Hey, what's your problem? Wow, I really wish somebody told me about the magical powers of cake. Maybe then our mom wouldn't be in rehab. Shut up! Did you make a cake for your mom the day she arrested my dad? Or was that a good day for her? Cameron... stop! Cameron, I need to talk to you for a second. $50 was stolen from Mrs. Belmont's house. If you're asking if I saw Jeff with it, I didn't. Cameron, the money was taken from the kitchen. You're the one that was cleaning in there. Did you take it? No. Look me in the eye and say that. I didn't take it! But of course you think I did. Add it to the list of reasons you don't want me around. Mariah and I never bought into this thing anyway. We know you're looking for an excuse to get rid of us. Stealing? How could you be so stupid? You want to live in some random foster home with people you don't know? I wanna stay at home. This is our home. It's the best one we're ever going to have. Fix this. So you think I'm guilty too? I know you, Cameron. Vern was bashed up pretty bad. Eyes were all black, he was scared. I'd never seen him like that. Did he say who beat him up? No, just that he had to leave town. Did you know Vern was robbing dealers? I never saw him do it, but he didn't have a job. He was always holding. The night he was bashed up... that was the last time you saw Vern? Yeah. Until Terry and I walked in on him ransacking our house. Tell me what he was looking for. Carla... Before he disappeared, right after he shot you, he gave me a bag. He said he would be back and he wanted me to hold on to it for a while. What was in the bag? About $10,000. And... a gun. Probably the one that he shot you with. He said he painted stars on the handle for every dealer he rolled. Do you still have it? Not the money, rehab's not cheap. But I hid it where I knew no one would look. Will you take me to it? If I do, does our ghost go away? If you testify, it's gone forever. No! I cannot testify, Terry will know everything. I'm sorry. Okay, if you just... if you just take me to the gun, I won't ask for anything else. I wish you'd told me. I was afraid he'd come after you. And I wanted you to be able to tell him you didn't know anything. Hang on, I got something...  The gun? That's it. It's empty. Yeah. Just one more day. We are close. Let me call you right back. The DA, sanctimonious jerk. Tell me you got the gun. It wasn't there, someone took it. It's time to put Keeler in the box. Give me five minutes with him... You mean give Victoria and Pete five minutes with him. But I'm the one that's... Personally involved. I don't need to remind you of procedure, do I, McLean? No, ma'am. Victoria and Pete will do a fine job with him. I'll just have them bring Keeler to room two. I'm at this special pharmacy. The doctor wants me to start on Clomid right away. But the only one that has it is in Edmonds. No, don't wait up sweetheart. I'll be home soon. Detective McLean will be right back. Let's get you a coffee. I just lied to my husband again. I promised myself that I would never do that. I need to go. Your friend shot my partner. He's not my friend, I need to go. If you go right now, he walks too. What if he has his gun? Get out of my way. What if the next person he shoots is your husband? I can't help you anymore. Just a few more questions so we can wrap this up. Without my lawyer? He's not coming tonight. You got stuff to hide, you want to wait? That's your call. Take him in. What's going on here? Keeler just saw his ex-girlfriend talking to me. And then he saw Allison, the cop he shot. So you need to go in there and help him put it together. That Carla gave us everything: the money, drugs, and the gun. Push him to a plea. Oh yeah, we'll enjoy this. We want to give you a chance to consider some options. As far as we're concerned, there are no good guys or bad guys in this room. Do you know why you're here? Cosmically or specifically? Specifically. That's too bad... the other answers were much better. Let's start with why you broke into 101 Martel Ave. Last night? Broke in? Is that what she told you? We came home to find an unknown man searching through our cupboards and drawers. That's what Mr. Martin told you. I am certainly not unknown to Mrs. Martin. She just couldn't tell you that in front of her pretty new husband. She and I, we had a pretty intense thing. It's hard to let go of something like that. Even after you marry someone else. You know what I mean? You, maybe not so much. But you, definitely. Where's he going with this? He's going to make a story about how they reconnected, then she felt guilty, refused to see him, so he had to break in to get something he left behind. And there's his misdemeanor. Built on a lie. So you were sleeping with Carla Martin? You mean Cyndi. We hadn't seen each other for quite some time. But then we bumped into each other, spark was still there, husband was out of town... Anyway, I had this watch on and afterwards, I forgot it. Good call. Too bad he just created a fairly plausible alibi. And gave Ginsley his foundation for defense. He thinks he's winning... that's okay. Let him swim a while until he feels the hook. So you broke in to get a watch? My watch... because she wouldn't give it back. You can ask her, I'm sure she'll deny it. She told us a lot, Nothing about a watch. It sounds like you two have a lot of history. She mentioned a gun, some money... You sure that's not what you broke in to find? Slow down. Easy. Their interview, their style. What do you expect from a drug addict? When we were together, that girl was so paranoid, she thought the lady at the Fluff 'n' Fold had a .45. That's why I left town. Wade Tilson said you left town because you shot a detective in Harper Park. So you  can  surprise Vern Keeler. Look, I beat the crap outta that guy. He'd say anything to throw me under the bus. If anyone shot her, it was him. Yes! He said her. How would he know if he wasn't there? Take it home, Victoria. I've never even been in that park. Carla says you went there all the time to score oxy. Wade said the same thing except he said stealing, not scoring. Is that what you were doing the night you shot the cop? I have no idea what you're talking about. That could be anyone. But it's not, it's you. And two minutes later, you shot Detective Allison McLean with that gun. The gun you gave Cyndi to hold for you. Not my name! Not yet! When we run ballistics on that gun and it matches the slug they pulled out of the detective, you're done. Judges don't like guys who shoot cops. We got Cyndi, we got Wade, we got the gun. The only play you got is a confession. You're smart, you've stayed out this long. But you're not staying out this time. Write it out, just like you want to say it. We'll work with the DA and you'll plead out at twenty. That's what you've got. That's why you're pushing so hard. Because without a confession, you got nothing. This was fun. Now are you escorting me out, or should I instruct my lawyer to file an unlawful detainment suit? Take him back to holding. Holding? Was it something I said? Shut up. You're gonna have to do better than that. Took Keeler's case. He's all over the DA, we can't hold Keeler any longer. I'm sorry. He almost killed me. We need a tail on him. Already done. But there are still leads that we... Go home. We’ll talk tomorrow. I'm sorry Allison. Cameron? Yeah? Where've you been? Uh... I was running. I told Mariah that Coach Crandall put me on a new training program. Mrs. Belmont called. Great, what now? She found her money. Told you I didn't take it. You did, I'm sorry. It's just strange that she found it on her side porch, when she was sure she left in the kitchen. People make mistakes all the time. I'm gonna go do my sprints. Can you tell what's going on? Who knows. I'm done. I never know what's going on with him or Mariah. Well there's plenty of drama so, whatever you choose. Hello. Mom's home and we're not done! Hey! Where's Cameron going? Went for a sprint. How'd it go? Mom, you okay? Uh, yeah. I just had a long day. I'll be fine. I'm just going to go change. [Gunshot] [Phone ringing] Lieutenant? Thanks for letting me know. What happened? He's gone, he got away from our guys. He knows my name. Find Cameron, get the kids into their bedrooms and stay there until I get back. Hey gang, can I get everybody upstairs right now please? Why? Right now! I need everybody upstairs! Right now let's go! What's going on? Cameron, you too! I need everybody upstairs. There's some guy sitting in his car out there. Jeff, right now! Alright, um... I'll let you know when its clear, okay? Devin! I thought you were Keeler. He slipped his tail. I know, that's why I grabbed an undercover car. I'm standing watch. He's not coming here... he's going to Carla's! Vern! Vern, please! You stole from me. Now we're gonna go to the bank, you're gonna take out all your money, you're gonna give it to me, understand? No! What's going on? [Carla screaming] No! Terry! Police! Put the weapon down, now! All we care about is Carla. Stay back! Give me a reason to shoot you Keeler, I'm ready. [Carla screaming] Stay with him, I've got this. Put pressure on the wound, do not move. [Carla screaming] You okay? Yeah. [Struggling] We have unfinished business, Detective. Let's finish it. [Mace cannister spraying] [Keeler cries out] Allison! Allison, please! This isn't the way. This isn't the way, all right? C'mon, get up, c'mon! Get down on your knees, hands on your head! Do it! [Police sirens] Good morning, everybody's up early. Actually, you're up a little late. It's a hummingbird cake. Where did that come from? You guys made it? It's your favorite. We though you could use some cake. I think we could all use some cake, right now. Cake for breakfast? Absolutely. I'll grab some plates. [Doorbell rings] I'll get it. Hey, come on in. We're having cake for breakfast. Of course you are. I thought you'd want to know, Terry Martin filed a missing person's report last night. Carla took off. And Keeler doesn't have his gun. There goes our case against him as my shooter. Keeler's gonna do time for what he did to the Martins. Two years, minimum. That gives us plenty of time, with him locked away, to put together a tight case against him for what he did to you. Hey! I'm not giving up on this. Does Terry have any idea where Carla went? He put together a list. Pete and Victoria are working on it. Okay, that's good. I just don't understand why she ran. I mean Terry's devastated. Says he'll go crazy until he finds her. She doesn't think he'll forgive her. She's... haunted. Come on, I want you to have some cake. Thanks, but I've got to go pick up Arielle. I just wanted to check on you. Give that girl a hug for me. Yeah. Hey, Devin. Thanks. Mom. Get some cake.
