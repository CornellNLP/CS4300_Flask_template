 Previously on Broadchurch... 
 She says she forgives you about the pendant. 
 I get messages - psychic messages. 
 You're saying Danny Latimer wants us to know he was put in a boat before he died? 
 I'm not his best friend! I hated him! 
 If someone deletes something from a hard drive, is it gone forever? 
 Tom? 
 You assaulted a child after you'd been drinking. 
 You've no alibi for the night of Danny's death. 
 When are we gonna talk about the baby? 
 You stay away! 
 I know about your husband and your children. 
 It's Danny's skateboard. 
 Who gave it to you? 
 Where's my dog? Bloody answer me! Where is the dog? 
 What are we gonna do with you, boy? 
 There's been a break-in at the hut. Someone reported torchlight inside. 
 Stop! Come on. 
 Get off! 
 (LABOURED BREATHING) 
 What are those? 
 Grapes. 
 What did you bring grapes for? 
 I hoped you might choke on the seeds. 
 They're seedless. 
 Don't be a smartarse. 
 I'm sensing you're angry with me. 
 You nearly died on me. 
 No! 
 No, you did, they told me. 
 They can't do that. 
 You discharged yourself before against their advice heart arrhythmia. You should've told me. 
 Bloody hell! Is there no privacy here? 
 Can't they fix you? 
 They want to put a pacemaker in me. 
 They don't know whether I'll survive the operation. 
 How long have you been like this? 
 18 months or so. 
 It's got worse in the last month or two. 
 So you came down here, you took that case, you took that job, knowing you weren't up to it? 
 We're nearly there, Miller. 
 That was the killer last night, I'm sure of it. 
 Sir, you're unfit for duty. 
 I have to finish this. 
 I can't let the family down. 
 Please, Miller, don't tell the Chief Super. Please. 
 I'm going back to work. 
 Miller, wait. Please don't go, Miller. Come back, Miller. 
 That's an order. 
 Miller! 
 Soco Young : I hear that shitface is laid up. 
 Shitface? 
 It's what the lads call him. 
 Shitface? Not much of a nickname. 
 Well, he does look like sh1t a lot of the time, doesn't he? 
 Is he gonna be all right? 
 Don't know. 
 Have you found anything? 
 We're only just up and running. 
 Your boys are checking the slope. 
 So you didn't catch proper sight of this person? 
 No, wish I had. 
 Well, if you go through... 
 We can start at the back and do a complete sweep all the way through. 
 Right. 
 Have a look in there. 
 SOCO are back up at the hut after last night. 
 Frank, go through our list of people of interest - those with no alibis or questionable alibis on the night of Danny's death. 
 Find out their movements from last night. 
 The likelihood is, the killer was there. 
 We were very close. They are rattled and they will make more mistakes. 
 Susan Wright is in custody, we've connected her to the site where Danny's body was found. 
 I'm continuing to question her, but time is running out before we have to apply for an extension. 
 I know this may sound daft, but we need to find her dog, Vince. 
 We have a picture. 
 The dog is a priority. She's very attached to it and it would help her to talk. 
 Uniform have turned up nothing so far. 
 You probably know the boss was taken ill last night, during the pursuit. 
 I don't know when he'll be back. 
 But we carry on. Do not get distracted. 
 Our duty is still to the Latimer family. 
 Thanks for everything you've done. 
 Bye for now. 
 Don't be ridiculous! 
 Don't start, Miller. 
 You can't be here. 
 Well, I am. 
 You'll kill yourself! 
 If that's what it takes. 
 It's not worth dying for. 
 Not for you, maybe. 
 Go away. We can manage without you. 
 That's what you've wanted right from the start, this job the job you think I stole. 
 For God's sake, sir! Come on, Miller. With me out you get to lead. 
 Dream come true. 
 I wouldn't want your job. 
 Don't be daft. If you get offered it, you'd take it. I wouldn't be up to it. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 What? 
 Well, it's a tough job. You've found your level. 
 Rural DS - keep within your limits. 
 Don't tell me what my limits are! 
 Then don't tell me to go home. 
 I can still solve this. Otherwise, why am I still here? 
 For God's sake. All right, then. 
 Right, everyone, back to work. 
 (LABOURED BREATHING) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 How are you? 
 Fine. 
 I've referred you to the Chief Medical Officer, first thing tomorrow. 
 I'm not leaving till this is solved. 
 You don't get a choice. 
 As soon as he sees you, you're done, Alec. 
 Why did you take this job if you knew you were this ill? 
 You all right? 
 Bring me up to speed with great economy. 
 Er... 
 Susan Wright's alibi for the night of Danny's death checks out. 
 The owner of the caravan park saw her sitting in the window watching TV with her dog when he left, about 1:30. 
 They'd had a birthday party in the bar which is why he was so late leaving that night. 
 We've had a match at the hut on the cliff for her DNA and prints, but the owner has already confirmed she does clean there. 
 No matches for any DNA on Danny's body. 
 So she didn't kill Danny? 
 But she knows something, I'm sure of it. 
 Don't sit here talking to me, go and get it out of her! 
 Go on. 
 Four cigarettes matching the brand you smoke got excavated close to the spot where Danny's body was found. 
 There are traces from the skateboard in your cupboard. 
 Your prints are on it, as are Danny's. 
 You lied to us about Mark Latimer getting the keys to the hut. 
 What were you doing on the beach near... 
 Where's my dog? Where's Vince? 
 I understand from your record... You don't understand anything... love. 
 Susan, I've been on this case a long time now. 
 I have lost so much patience. 
 If you don't tell me how you came by the board, I will have you charged. You will be in custody. 
 When I find your dog, I will have him put down. 
 Now, tell me what happened. 
 I was just going out, up from my caravan. 
 Up the hill onto the cliff top. 
 When we got up there... I saw it. 
 Saw what? 
 The boy... lying there. 
 Anything else? 
 We walked back down the hill onto the beach. 
 And what time was this? 
 Three, maybe four. 
 That's when you walk your dog? 
 It's lovely during the night round here. 
 So you walked down onto the beach... 
 He was all... splayed out. 
 The skateboard was next to him. 
 He was beautiful. 
 You've got children? 
 Yeah. 
 If you've got kids, I don't understand how you could stand over Danny's body, smoke and then carry on walking your dog. 
 I knew he'd be found. 
 I didn't want to get involved. 
 You people destroyed my family. 
 How? 
 It don't matter. 
 It does, because it affected how you were when you saw Danny's body. 
 We had two girls. 
 My husband was an electrician. 
 He used to have s*x with the oldest, but I didn't know. 
 Then he tried it on with the young one. 
 Her sister was having none of it. 
 She wanted to protect her little baby sister. 
 So she got herself killed. 
 He told me she'd gone travelling. 
 She'd never said nothing to me. 
 After a while, people started asking questions. 
 Then you lot came, took the young one into care. 
 Arrested him. 
 He told them that I knew... that I was part of it, but... I didn't know. I never knew. 
 I was pregnant. 
 Social Services came. 
 They took the baby. 
 They said I wasn't a fit mother. 
 Everything I told the police got twisted, thrown back at me. 
 He was convicted. 
 Got life. 
 Hung himself in his cell ten months later. 
 Death. 
 Once it's got its claws into you... it never lets go. 
 When I was standing on that beach, looking at that boy's body, I just kept wondering if... if my girl looked that peaceful after he killed her. 
 I don't think she did. 
 OK, petal. 
 You are a gem, a precious gem. 
 No, Mum's the word. 
 Thank you. 
 Olly, Olly. Here. 
 You're looking a bit giddy there. 
 Yvonne, in the hospital, doing her welcome carer thing. 
 Who does she see? 
 DI Hardy. 
 Well, you know Yvonne. 
 She went straight into military eavesdropping mode. 
 He was rushed in last night. 
 Heart problems, serious. Now he's discharged himself. 
 He's gone back to work? 
 Exactly! 
 Have we got a story brewing here, sweetheart. 
 How would you like to put it to him? 
 You were the last person I expected to call. 
 Really? Surely nothing's a surprise to you? 
 Very funny. I've never heard that one before. 
 What do you want? 
 The Latimer case. I'll take anything now, cos I'm running out of time. 
 So if you have anything for me, give it to me now. 
 Thank you. It's about time. 
 Look, I've been trying to tell you, I got a message from Danny. 
 It was someone he knew. 
 It was someone close to home. 
 What does that mean? 
 Close geographically? 
 Family, friends, what? 
 I don't know. 
 I... 
 Just don't ignore it. 
 Prove to me that you're not a bullshitter. 
 I gave you something, I told you. You just pretended to ignore it. 
 I said, "She forgives you for the pendant. " 
 What does that mean? 
 You already know, I can see it. 
 I haven't got a clue what it means. 
 All I get are fragments and that's what I got from you. 
 That and that you've been here before. 
 What? 
 Just that. 
 You have. 
 You have, you've been here before! 
 I'm right, aren't I? 
 I am. 
 How's it feel... having to eat humble pie like this? 
 DI Hardy? 
 No. 
 But you don't know what I want. 
 I know the answer's no. 
 How are you feeling? 
 What did you say? 
 You were at the hospital. 
 I don't know what the hell you're playing at. 
 You were rushed to hospital, heart problems. You discharged yourself. 
 I don't want to stitch you up, genuinely. 
 So what do you want? 
 An exclusive. 
 Everybody wants us to see counsellors, but I don't want to share what I feel with a stranger. 
 Don't rule it out. There are some really great people locally. 
 I know it doesn't seem like it but... talking will help. 
 We thought that... 
 Well, Beth suggested and I agreed, that er... maybe you could counsel us. 
 That's why we came. 
 Right. 
 Beth : You know us, you know what it's been like. 
 And you're kind. 
 We just thought you could help, you know? But not from a religious point of view. 
 You can mention God. We don't want banging over the head with it. 
 No, I understand. No banging. 
 Well... listen, I'd be honoured but... why now? 
 The baby. 
 We're due for the scan. 
 But I don't know if I want to see it. 
 I want to want it but I don't. 
 Don't say that. 
 It's all right, Mark. My heart is still full of Danny. 
 There isn't room for another baby. 
 There will be. 
 Stop telling me how I'm going to feel! 
 Because you have no idea and no ability to understand. 
 Shutting this out is not an option for me. 
 I can't do that boxing thing off that you do. 
 I have to carry another life in me. For six more months. Feeding off me, breathing from me, sharing my blood. 
 While you're still grieving. 
 Yes. And I can't let Danny go. 
 Nobody's telling you... Sorry. 
 It's difficult, isn't it? Sorry. 
 You should talk. 
 All I want... is to swap places with Danny. 
 Let me be taken instead of him. 
 In the night, I lie there and I think, "What would I go through to have him back?" 
 I'd be raped, I'd be tortured, I'd have a gang of men on me, I'd be left for dead, if it meant he was safe. 
 Are you all right, Mark? 
 Yeah... 
 We just need some answers, don't we? 
 Some help. 
 You have a line to the big man. Why don't you ask him? 
 We're drowning down here. 
 We just want it done, don't we? 
 I mean... 
 When we met, she was 15, Beth. 
 She was... just beautiful. 
 She was so sunny all the time. 
 And now this life with me, it's just destroyed her, hasn't it? 
 That girl's gone. 
 So I just keeping thinking how your life would be if you'd never met me. 
 This isn't on you. 
 Can I make a suggestion? 
 New life is... a gift. 
 And maybe you can take in this gift, even if you don't want it yet. 
 Go for the scan, see how you feel. 
 Because God has sent you this life. 
 You may not agree, but... perhaps he's... sent you not what you want... but what you need. 
 Ellie : What I'm struggling with is, I know those cliffs. 
 If you're walking your dog, you can't see straight down. 
 You'd have to be right on the edge to see Danny's body lying on the beach. 
 The angle's wrong. So what you're saying doesn't ring true. 
 If you don't believe me, that's your problem. 
 I think you saw more than you're telling us. 
 So have a good think. 
 Or I will charge you for obstructing a murder inquiry. 
 I didn't see anything. 
 Like you didn't see what your husband was up to? 
 You were out walking when Danny's body was laid on the beach. What did you see? 
 A boat. 
 I wasn't on the cliffs. 
 I was on the beach. 
 I saw a boat come in. 
 What sort of boat? 
 Little... like a rowing boat. 
 But it had a motor on the back. 
 I saw it come into shore. 
 Ellie : How many people on board? 
 One. 
 Are you sure? 
 Certain. 
 I saw him get off. 
 Him? Are you sure it was a man? 
 Yeah. 
 And what did that person do? 
 He carried the body off the boat... and laid it on the beach. 
 Then he got back on the boat and went off. 
 Which direction? 
 West. 
 And did you recognise the person that laid Danny's body on the beach? 
 Susan? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Mum, please go back inside. 
 Ellie, can you take my mum in, please? 
 
 
 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Mark? 
 Yeah. 
 It's Nige. 
 All right, mate. 
 I want you to hear this from me. 
 The police have taken me in. And you're my phone call. 
 Taken you in for what? 
 They think I had something to do with Danny. 
 It's all wrong, this. You know that. 
 Hey. Hey, I'll see you when you're done. 
 Don't worry about anything. You just... 
 You tell them the truth and stay strong. All right? 
 All right. I have to go. 
 I have to talk to them. 
 Right, you take Susan. I'll take Nigel. 
 Find out how she knows him, what the connection is. 
 I'll see where he says he was that night. 
 And why the hell he had her dog. 
 Are you all right to question him? Feeling OK? 
 Spectacular. 
 Run me through where you were the night Danny Latimer was killed. 
 We went through all this weeks ago, when you had Mark in. 
 I was at home with my mum and we was watching telly. 
 What were you watching? 
 Um... A show about baking. 
 Mum loves that. 
 Do you know this woman, Nigel? 
 Don't think so. 
 Do you own a dog? 
 Not really. 
 Not really? What, sometimes you do? The dog comes around part-time? 
 No. 
 This amusing to you? 
 I don't own a dog. 
 Why was there a dog in your back garden? 
 Someone asked me to look after it for 'em. 
 The owner? This woman? 
 Susan Wright? Who you said you didn't know. 
 If you're gonna lie, you have to be consistent. 
 Cos then there's the issue of your alibi for the night of Danny's death. 
 The one you told us about when we were interviewing Mark. 
 It was good enough for then, but not now? 
 Your mum already told us you weren't in all that night. 
 You went out at half-ten for last orders, she said, when we had Matt Latimer here. 
 So where were you, Nigel? 
 You must know Nigel pretty well to recognise him at night from that distance. 
 When did you last see Nigel? 
 A couple of weeks ago. 
 He came to the caravan. He had a crossbow. 
 Threatened to kill me. 
 OK. Why did he do that? 
 You'll have to ask him. 
 No, I'm asking you. 
 He didn't like what I was saying. 
 What were you saying? 
 Don't remember. 
 Don't remember what you said to make a man threaten you with a crossbow? 
 No, not really. 
 It happens a lot to you, does it? 
 Off and on. 
 It ain't always a crossbow. 
 So Nigel threatens you for some unknown reason and you frame him as the killer? 
 It was him carrying that body. 
 How do you know Susan Wright? 
 I don't want to talk about her. You should have her arrested, have her in for harassment. I told her to leave me alone but she wouldn't. 
 When did she start harassing you? 
 The moment she got here. Like... four or five months back. 
 What's she harassing you about? 
 Susan Wright told us she believes you killed Danny Latimer. 
 She said she saw you on the beach with a boat, dragging Danny's body. 
 She's lying. Did you drag Danny's body onto the beach? 
 Did you kill Danny? 
 No, he's my best mate's boy. Why would I? 
 Then why is Susan Wright saying otherwise? 
 What's she got to harass you about? 
 She says she's my mum. 
 Her son? And she's accusing him of murder? What's going on between them two? 
 You'd better ask her. 
 Susan : They took him away from me when everything happened. 
 25 years. 
 Then the law changed. 
 You could request contact. 
 Took me 18 months to track him down. 
 I didn't know I was adopted until she came. 
 Susan : He reacted badly. Didn't want nothing to do with me. 
 He threatened me with a crossbow. 
 Nigel : I know, and that was stupid, but with everything that was going on, she... she didn't belong here. 
 There's enough to deal with. 
 Does he know about your family, about what happened? 
 You don't tell him. 
 I'm having trouble with, if you're his mum and you want to be reconciled with him, why did you tell us he was on the beach that night? 
 I'm a mum, and whatever my child had done, I would want to protect them. 
 I am protecting him. 
 I told you because I'm scared. 
 For him. 
 Because it's not his fault. 
 If he's his father's son, what is he capable of? 
 What might he have done? 
 I can't just let it happen. 
 Not again. 
 Nigel, you need to tell us where you were the night Danny died. 
 At night... 
 I went out, just for a couple of hours. 
 I went to the estate. Past Oak Farm. 
 They've been laying down pheasant, so I just went and got a couple. 
 I mean, he's got dozens. He don't even know. 
 You were nicking pheasants? 
 Yeah. 
 The butcher in town takes 'em off my hands. 
 It's not like... like I'm gonna make me fortune working with Mark. 
 But... I forgot to fill up the van. So um... I siphoned some diesel out of his tractor. And then I cut through the barbed-wire fence to make it look like a break-in. But I was nowhere near that beach. Whatever she thought she saw, she didn't. 
 So she's lying? 
 Mate, I don't even know who she is. 
 Do you want to know... who she is? 
 Because... in here there are newspaper articles about her. 
 About her husband. 
 It's your family, Nigel. 
 Interview paused 3:02pm. 
 You did what? 
 He wanted to know. 
 I promised her. 
 What did you do that for? 
 I was gaining her trust. 
 I was gaining his. 
 We have to cut through what's connected to Danny and what isn't. 
 You're the only one running out of time. 
 These are people's lives your trampling on. I should make a complaint. 
 Go ahead. Add it to the list. I'll sign it for you. 
 He's a suspect. He was seen with the body. 
 The information I gave him has bearing on the witness who is accusing him. 
 You should have let her tell him. I don't believe Nigel was capable of killing Danny. 
 Everyone we have interviewed is capable in the right circumstances. 
 That's your view of the world. I don't know how you sleep. 
 Who says I sleep? 
 Have you seen this? 
 I got them to trace the number of the call that phoned in to tell us the light was on in the hut. 
 It's Danny's mobile. It's the missing smartphone. 
 Oh, my God. The killer phoned in. 
 Why would he do that? 
 Why tell us where they were and then run? That don't make sense. 
 Oh, for God's sake. 
 As if working with you wasn't annoying enough, what are they playing at? 
 All right. Get Nigel and Susan released on bail. 
 Have them lodge their passports here and report in every day. 
 You're gonna let them both out together? 
 I'll cobble together some surveillance. 
 Use some of those numpties they drafted in. 
 Maybe Nigel and Susan are both lying. 
 Let's see what happens. 
 Light the blue touchpaper and then retire? 
 We're running out of time. 
 Well, you might be. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Hello. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll be right over. 
 Over where? 
 You... Ugh! 
 I've got something for you. 
 This is Tom Miller's laptop. I caught him smashing it up in the woods. 
 You just stumbled across him? 
 I was out walking. It's the route I take. 
 Do you know what he was trying to get rid of? 
 I've no idea. 
 Why did he do that, just after his best mate's died? 
 Were they best friends? I didn't see much evidence of it. 
 I had to break up a fight between them. 
 When was this? 
 A couple of months ago. 
 They were having a row. 
 Tom was really, really laying into Danny. 
 And he's that much bigger. 
 I reported it to both sets of parents. I thought Ellie would have told you. 
 No. She didn't mention it. 
 Look, I should tell you that Tom knows that I have this. 
 He threatened to tell you that I abused Danny, if I handed it over. 
 He said that? 
 And did you... abuse Danny? 
 No. 
 What were you talking to Tom Miller about at Jack Marshall's wake? 
 I was just making sure he was OK. 
 Thanks. 
 You need to report in to us every evening at 6pm. 
 Why do you keep looking at me like that? 
 Back then, in your own house, how could you not know? 
 I need a wee favour on the quiet. 
 Things are complicated. 
 Can you get stuff off Danny's hard drive? 
 Oh, great. I owe you one. Will you send whatever you find to my personal email? 
 Great. You're a star. 
 All right. Can you just take us through what happened last night? 
 I was pursuing a suspect. 
 There was an incident and I was injured. 
 Can you name the suspect? 
 No. And I'm asking you don't publish this yet. 
 Give me a couple of days. 
 All right. 
 Olly just has a couple of questions first. 
 Oh, does he? 
 The Sandbrook case fell apart at the trial. 
 Tell me what went wrong. 
 Are you serious? 
 He's more than serious. 
 He's myprotege. 
 We've seen you here. We know you're doing your best for the family, the town. 
 I don't think it was any different on Sandbrook. So tell me what happened. 
 How did it all go so wrong? 
 You can't keep it secret for ever. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe it is time. 
 We had our prime suspect but all of the evidence was circumstantial. 
 Um... but then during a... search of a car that he'd just sold... one of my DS's found a pendant... belonging to one of the girls. 
 There were clearly prints on it. It was the smoking gun. 
 My DS was taking the bagged evidence back to HQ... and... she... stopped at a hotel for a drink and her car was broken into. 
 The car radio and valuables in her bag were all taken. 
 Just a quick smash and grab. Local kids, probably. 
 And the pendant? 
 Yeah. We couldn't make the case after that, so he's still out there. 
 Why did she stop off at the hotel? 
 She was having an affair with one of the other DS's on the team. 
 She thought she'd celebrate. 
 But this was all reported at the time. 
 The Herald got the story. 
 But they said it was you, your car. 
 You took the blame. 
 It happened on my watch. 
 She deceived you? 
 This detective sergeant... she was my wife. 
 We have a daughter and I didn't want her knowing that about her mother. 
 So... you took the blame. You took all that flak for years. The family think it's you. But you didn't do it. This is what made you ill, isn't it? 
 People need to know about this? 
 Do they? 
 Really? Why? 
 Just do me a favour and tell the family first, will you? 
 Just tell them I haven't given up on Sandbrook and that the case is still open. 
 And then do whatever you like with it. 
 Call your friend Karen. This is what she's always wanting. 
 One one condition. You do not name that DS. 
 Right. 
 Well, I'm done. 
 How did you get in here? 
 If you don't go within the hour, I will gut this dog whilst you sleep. 
 If I go... I'm not coming back. 
 We'll never see each other again. 
 I can do that. 
 I've done it plenty of times. 
 You contact the police and tell them you made a mistake. 
 It wasn't me you saw. 
 And then you go. 
 You're the spit of him, Nigel. 
 You've got him in you. 
 And it was you I saw. 
 That was great, Mrs Latimer. Thank you. 
 Dean, love, just call me Beth. 
 "Mrs Latimer" makes me feel like Mark's mum. 
 And none of us want that. 
 Oh, er, I got you something. 
 For me? 
 For all of you. 
 Oh. 
 For the family. For letting me in. And for the future. But mainly for the new baby. 
 It's the first one, for the new... 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. 
 Oh, don't worry, mate. It's er... 
 It's all a bit muddled in with everything else. 
 He was a good lad, Dan. 
 Heard anything about Nige? 
 No. I asked Pete but he's heard no news. 
 It's not Nige, Dad. Don't go thinking that. It won't be. 
 Chloe's right. It can't be Nige. 
 Him and Dan really got on. I saw it every time we went out. 
 What do you mean "went out"? 
 Catching animals. They'd come up to the farm and then we'd go out from there. 
 Late evenings. 
 Danny said it was OK. 
 Nige said you knew. 
 No. No, we didn't know. 
 Miller? 
 Forensics from the hut. 
 Boot print in the mud up the hill matches one they found inside. 
 It's a man's size ten. What's Nigel Carter's shoe size? 
 Ten. 
 So, what? You think Susan did see Nige? 
 Are we missing something here? 
 What if another person was involved? 
 Is this something for the morning? 
 Oh, by the way. Your boy and Danny. Did they fall out? 
 No. Paul Coates, the vicar, said there was a fight. He mentioned it to you. 
 No, he didn't. 
 Are you saying I've been covering for my son? 
 No. 
 You do that when you're on the back foot. You lash out. 
 When did Danny last come up your house? 
 It's 2 a. m. I don't know. 
 Last month? Last two months? 
 A bit longer. 
 Can we borrow Tom's computer? 
 Fine. 
 Good night. 
 What are you doing? 
 Where is his computer? 
 El, it's half two in the morning. 
 I'm sorry. Right? I don't know where it is. 
 If we go through his room now, we'll wake him. Do it tomorrow. 
 That's your answer for everything - do it tomorrow. 
 What? What have I done? 
 Yeah, what have you done? 
 You can't even finish painting this room. Six bloody months. 
 For God's sake. Go to sleep, El. 
 Of course.
