 Oh, God. 
 There you go. 
 Why didn't you wake me? 
 I did. You told me to piss off. 
 I don't remember. 
 I do. All the clocks have stopped in the house. 
 It's probably just a fuse. 
 Oh, Mum, I've got a temperature. 
 You haven't. 
 I'm not going. 
 If I have to, you have to. Doesn't she? 
 Not getting involved. 
 Ooh-ooh! 
 Hi, Mum. 
 Morning, Liz. 
 Fresh eggs, we had a bumper lay. 
 Look at them, eh? Love you zillions. 
 OK. 
 Er... oi! 
 Hello, love. 
 I've got a temperature. 
 Have you now? 
 She hasn't. 
 Gotta go. I'm late to meet Nige. 
 Have you seen Danny? He forgot his lunch. 
 Already gone. 
 All right. I'm late. 
 Cheerio, love. 
 Get off! 
 All right, you lot? 
 How's it going? All right? 
 My first day back at work, ask me later. 
 Sports Day, isn't it? Show 'em what you got. 
 I will. 
 We should get the lads out. 
 Definitely. I'll text you later. 
 All right, Jen? 
 Sorry, love. Sorry. 
 Where were you for five-a-side last Tuesday? 
 Sorry. I had to go over to Lyme. 
 Mate's band were playing. 
 No excuses next time, eh? 
 Yeah. 
 Morning, ladies. 
 All right, how are you? 
 Hey. 
 Morning, Oll. 
 All right, Mark? How's it going? 
 Beautiful weather. Sunshine and showers they reckon. 
 How's your mum? Is she OK? 
 Not bad, thanks for asking. 
 Pass on my love. 
 Yeah, will do, mate. Absolutely. 
 Oi, don't you sneak past. 
 Knock, knock. 
 All right, Maggie? 
 All right, Mark? 
 Got your ad renewal for you there, Mag. Ah, a week late. 
 Oh, sorry, no-one's perfect, eh? 
 Lovely morning for it. 
 All right, Becca? 
 Your hotel started that tradesman's discount yet? 
 You've gotta have class to eat here. 
 Class? I'm all class, me. 
 Keep telling yourself that. 
 You're late. Yeah, sorry, traffic's really stacking up. 
 There's all them lovely tourist girls ripe for your picking. 
 Shut up! 
 So, what was the upshot of last night, then? 
 How about you just drive? 
 Morning. You all right? 
 Hi. Morning! 
 Hi, I'm back! 
 Thank you very much. Quite right too. 
 Dom, I got you lung busters, against my better judgment. 
 Nish. Look. Vodka, black label. 
 Very nice. Thank you. 
 Not at all. 
 Anna, I got you lip gloss for all your kissing. Thank you. 
 Mike... moisturiser. Give that lovely face a lift. Thank you. 
 I got you a cuddly penguin, Frank. I know you get lonely. 
 Come on, then. What's all the gossip? 
 Ellie. Welcome back. Can I have a quick word? 
 What's the news? 
 We've given the job to someone else. 
 What? 
 I know it's a disappointment. 
 You said it'd wait till I got back from leave. You said I was a shoo-in. 
 The situation changed. 
 Christ! 
 Who? Who got it? 
 DI Alec Hardy. 
 A man? 
 What happened to, "The area needs a female DI"? 
 What happened to I've got your backing? 
 Alec Hardy has a lot of experience. 
 Why do I know that name? 
 He was in charge of the Sandbrook murders. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 When does he start? 
 Last week. 
 You wanna see this or not? 
 Yep, OK. Received. 
 That's where they cut to get in. Siphoned the whole bloody tank. 
 We'll be in touch. 
 Is that it? 
 What about forensics? 
 I can't afford this, the price of diesel. 
 You called me at seven in the morning for that. Too good for it, are you? 
 Just got a call. Coastguard reported something down by the shore. 
 After all she said to me, what's the bloody point? 
 Shall I just walk out, clear my desk and go? 
 No, I know. But you should have seen me, I was so happy coming back. 
 I'm in here! 
 Ellie, you've got a shout. 
 Gotta go. 
 Can you see Danny? 
 I can't see him. He'll be with his class. 
 I can't believe you're making me come to this. 
 Hey, your choice. Stay here or get on to your own school. 
 Oh, all right. I'll go in. 
 I love you very much. 
 And if you remember that smile give it a go for me, would you? 
 Usain Bolt. OK? 
 Now all look egg-cited. 
 Hiya. 
 All right? 
 Beth? 
 No Danny? 
 Oh, I thought he was here. 
 No, we haven't seen him today. 
 Well, did you do the register? 
 Yeah, we haven't seen him since yesterday. 
 Miss? 
 Danny, it's Mum. So, you're not at school. Can you give me a call straightaway? 
 I just wanna know where you are. 
 Jack, it's Beth. Danny did his paper round this morning, right? 
 Oh, er... OK. Did he ring? 
 No, no, no, it's fine. I'm just... just not quite sure where he is. 
 Mark, it's me. Ring me now. 
 Tom? Tom! 
 Danny didn't say he was going anywhere this morning, did he? 
 He's not in trouble. 
 OK. Thank you. 
 Can I do anything? 
 Just give me a call if he shows up. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Hey, Tom. 
 Oh, come on. Come on. 
 Main road to the coast at Broadchurch. 
 If you are heading to the beach I suggest you make other plans. 
 What's going on? 
 Someone said the police are at the beach. 
 They might have found a body. 
 Stand back. Stand back, please. 
 Oh, God, don't do this to me. 
 Come on. 
 Oh, God. No, no, no. 
 Off the beach. 
 This area's off-limits. 
 No, I'm police. 
 Oh, God, I know him. He lives here. He has tea at my house. He's my boy's best friend. 
 Oh, God, Beth. Does Beth know? 
 All right, calm down. 
 You don't understand. I know that boy. Shut it off. 
 "Shut it off"? Be professional. You're working a case now. 
 Alec Hardy. 
 I know. You got my job. 
 You wanna do that now? 
 You don't even know who he is. 
 Tell me! 
 Danny. Daniel Latimer. 11 years old. Goes to school with my boy Tom. 
 His family live here. Dad's the local plumber. 
 Is this a suicide spot? 
 He wouldn't do that. 
 Answer the question. 
 There are others - one three miles west; another one further inland. 
 He's not that type of kid. 
 Find out where SOCO are. 
 We have to move fast. That tide'll be in. 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God. Who's that? 
 No, Beth, get off the beach. 
 What have you found? 
 Let me see, let me see. 
 You can't be here! 
 Stop. Get her off the beach. Get away. Those are his shoes. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Those are Danny's trainers! 
 No! 
 Danny! 
 Ah, Olly, you're back. 
 Survived Sports Day. 
 Not only that - coffees. 
 Ah. That's three shots. 
 Double-page spread. Spell all the children's names correctly, please. 
 I don't want the parents berating me. 
 So, Reg didn't turn up. Red Lion. 
 What, you mean we've got no pictures? 
 Ah. 
 Camera phone. I took them myself. 
 Ah... good initiative, Olly. 
 Show me how to download these. 
 Why do still use Reg? He always lets you down. 
 I see Reg in the supermarket every Saturday. We look after our own here. 
 Oh, look at their little faces. 
 Oh, that's very nice. You've almost got an eye. 
 I tell Reg I'm using camera phone pictures in the paper. 
 He'll be back and sober within the hour. 
 Oh, my God. It's the Daily Mail. 
 It's my application. 
 Open it. 
 Bastards! 
 Oh, sweetheart. 
 There's plenty of other newspapers. 
 I've tried them all now. 
 You're good, petal. Your time will come. 
 Now, look, text from Yvonne. 
 She says the beach is closed off for some reason. 
 Go down, check it out, will you? 
 Get some fresh air. 
 Sure. 
 They let people walk along here, no safety barriers? 
 It's a coastal path. People know to be careful. 
 It's a death trap. 
 How's it going? Well, from what we've got up here, sir, it looks like the rock fall around the body was faked. 
 What do you mean? 
 The angle of the body was wrong. 
 It was too arranged. 
 And up here there's no flattened grass or slippage. 
 No loose rocks. No fibres, no hand marks. 
 No sense of a downward trajectory. 
 You mean he didn't fall? 
 Could he have jumped? 
 That's unlikely, sir, given where he was found and the trajectory off the cliffs. 
 See, not Danny. 
 If you ask me... someone tried to make it look like an accident. 
 I don't think he was up here. 
 Get on to the pathologist. Tell him to hurry up. 
 Even if it is just preliminary. 
 DS Miller! 
 Who's that? 
 Just keep walking. 
 Ellie! 
 He seems to know you. 
 Auntie Ellie. 
 I told you, don't do that. 
 Olly Stevens, Broadchurch Echo. 
 I was down at the other end. 
 Why has the beach been closed? 
 No statements now. 
 I heard there was a body. Has it been ID'd? 
 Please. 
 There will be a statement, Oliver. 
 Are they all in there? Sir, I can lead this with the family. 
 No. 
 I know them. How many deaths like this have you worked? 
 This is my first. You can't make it better. Don't try. 
 You don't know how I work. 
 Most likely premise is abduction. 
 Was he taken? If so, who by? 
 Watch them. Every movement. 
 If anything doesn't make sense you tell me. 
 OK. 
 Don't look at me like that. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 I'm Detective Inspector Alec Hardy and you know DS Miller. 
 Why don't you take a seat? We need to talk about something. Yeah. 
 Sit down. 
 Get a chair. 
 Don't worry, I can do it. 
 The body of a young boy was found... 
 It's Danny, isn't it? 
 I saw his shoes. 
 Plenty of kids have those shoes. 
 Sorry. You talk. 
 We believe it's Danny's body. 
 Who is it, Ellie? Was it him? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, it's all right. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Was it an accident? Did he fall? 
 We don't know yet. 
 Can you think why he might have been up on the cliffs last night or this morning? 
 He wouldn't have been. 
 Well, he obviously was. 
 He didn't have any reason to be. 
 How was Danny over the past few days? 
 He didn't kill himself if that's what you're suggesting. 
 He's been just... normal. 
 He wouldn't kill himself. He knows he can talk to us about anything. 
 And you last saw him when? 
 I looked in on him er... about nine o'clock last night. 
 He was laid in bed reading. 
 Anyone see Danny this morning? 
 No. He was up and out before anyone else. He's got a paper round. 
 But he didn't turn up for that. 
 Jack, I spoke to him. 
 He runs the paper shop. 
 Any signs of forced entry or disturbance round the house? 
 No, nothing. 
 I wanna see the body. 
 You might be wrong about it being him. 
 So, I wanna be sure. I wanna see. 
 How many times you done this, Ell? 
 I haven't. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 Mark! All right, buddy? 
 All right, Trev? 
 What you in here for? Nothing serious, I hope? 
 Nah. 
 Sign this petition, will you? 
 They're threatening to close this place down. In a bit of a rush. 
 Oh, come on. Won't take two seconds. 
 It's important. 
 Ah, good man. Hey, coming to skittles, the Lion on Tuesday? 
 The Yetminster. Grudge match. 
 I don't know, mate. 
 See how it goes, eh? 
 Right. Give my love to Beth and the kids. 
 All this way I thought it wouldn't be him. 
 My Danny. 
 Can I touch him, Ell? 
 Why him, eh, Ell? 
 He's only little, isn't he? He's just... He's just my little boy, isn't he? 
 Listen, boy. 
 Er... I'm... I'm sorry that I er... that I wasn't there for you and er... 
 You're... you're my... 
 You're my boy, Danny, and I let you down. 
 I'm so, so sorry. 
 I love you zillions, superstar. 
 I always will. 
 Was Danny Latimer abducted? 
 Did someone gain access to the house? 
 If so, how? 
 If it wasn't forced entry, who has the key? 
 We need to collect any CCTV from a mile radius around the house. 
 Miller - family. 
 Who are they and where were they? 
 Beth had Chloe, their eldest daughter, when she was 15. 
 Mark was 17. 
 Mum and daughter were at home watching telly. 
 They say they didn't leave the house until school next morning. 
 Dad was out on an emergency call-out. He's a plumber. 
 He got in around three. Neither parent thought to check on Danny. 
 Gran lives nearby. She was in all evening. The other gran lives in Wales. 
 Until we're ready all of this remains confidential. 
 No gossip. Do you understand? 
 All right. Go on. 
 Given the nature of this case it makes sense to hand it on to another lead officer. 
 No. 
 It's nothing to do with your ability. We don't want Sandbrook to become a thing. 
 I was completely exonerated. 
 Alec, you came down here to lie low. 
 I came to do whatever the job requires. 
 But in terms of public perception, you may be vulnerable. 
 I'm giving you the chance to step back. Nobody will blame you. 
 This happened a stone's throw from your station. 
 I've met your team. No-one's as qualified as me. 
 Sandbrook doesn't make me vulnerable. 
 It makes me the best man for the job. 
 You wanna stop me, you're welcome to try. 
 Thanks for the 99. 
 What did Jenkinson want? 
 Jenkinson? 
 The Chief Super. I saw you walking with her. No. 
 I did, you were having 99s. Miller, your son went to school with Danny. 
 Does he know yet? 
 No. 
 You need to talk to him. 
 Tomorrow. I'll tell him tonight. 
 And, sir, do you mind not calling me Miller? 
 Why? I don't really like the surname thing. 
 I prefer Ellie. 
 Ellie. 
 Ellie. No. 
 
 
 
 Jack, we need to ask you a few questions. 
 Danny didn't turn up for his round this morning? 
 I assumed he was sick. 
 Did he often miss his round? 
 They all do, one time or another. 
 How was Danny yesterday? 
 No different from usual. 
 You didn't notice anything on his mind? 
 He was only in here 15 minutes first thing. I'm no psychiatrist. 
 Are you married? 
 No. 
 Are you? 
 They brought him in here, Mark and Beth. 
 Three days old, he was. 
 It's not right. 
 What do you have? Superficial cuts and bruises to the face. 
 Traces of domestic cleaning fluid on the skin. 
 Cause of death was asphyxiation. 
 He was strangled. 
 Bruising to the neck and windpipe and at the top of the spine. 
 The pattern of bruises suggest large hands. 
 I'd suggest er... male. 
 It erm... it would have been brutal. 
 The angle suggests he would have been facing his attacker. 
 Er... He would have known. 
 Any sexual violence? 
 Mercifully, no. 
 The time of death? 
 Er, I'd put it between 10pm Thursday night and 4am Friday morning. 
 Thank you. 
 We don't get these around here. 
 Make sure you find them. 
 We have some preliminary findings. 
 We are treating Danny's death as suspicious. 
 Oh. 
 We think he may have been killed. 
 I should have checked on him before I went to bed. 
 If I'd checked... 
 Beth, this is not your fault. 
 Whatever happened, this is not down to you. 
 I promise... we will find the person responsible. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You have my word. 
 He's a little boy. 
 Chlo, I don't know what to say. 
 I know. 
 It doesn't feel real. 
 Are the police round? 
 Come on, let's go. I want to do this. 
 Seriously? 
 What did they ask you? 
 Do they know about us? Cos you ain't 16 yet. 
 Nobody knows. Let's go. 
 Are you OK? 
 I'll be better once I've eaten something. 
 Do you want anything? 
 No. 
 Do you think other kids are in danger? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 Are you sure you're OK? 
 Do you want me to do it? 
 Hello? 
 Is it Danny Latimer? 
 I can't talk to you. 
 I've seen Chloe at the beach. It is, isn't it? This isn't appropriate, Oliver. 
 It is him. Oh, my God. The poor kid. 
 I did not confirm that. This is not a confirmation. 
 No, I understand, Auntie Ellie. 
 Olly... 
 Hi, it's Olly. Leave a message. 
 Answer my bloody calls. I did not confirm that. 
 You cannot speculate about this incident. Are we clear? 
 Karen, you might want to see this. 
 Not now, Sam. 
 I've this Department of Education press release that's got to sound like essential news. 
 It's barely in English. 
 Who teaches these people? 
 You said tell you if anything comes on the local paper Twitter feeds. 
 Go on, then, quick. 
 Body found on Dorset beach. 
 Young boy, possible suspicious death. 
 OK. Have you got a link you can send me? 
 Already did. 
 You already did. 
 Thanks. 
 This is how grateful I am. I'm going to give you the last of my muffin. 
 So how's it going? 
 Great. Two minutes. 
 I'm going to take Danny's computer away for examination. 
 Will they get it back? Sure, as soon as we've finished with it. 
 It's got his stuff on it. 
 We'll be careful. 
 Why have you released his name? 
 Did you agree to that? 
 What? 
 It's on Twitter. From the Broadchurch Echo. Daniel Latimer. 
 Why have they done that? 
 Talk to the officer in charge. 
 Nobody told us this was going to happen. 
 Aren't they supposed to consult? 
 How do you know anyway? 
 I've got a Google alert on "Broadchurch" and "death". 
 Oh, for goodness' sake, Chloe! 
 Well, it's a good job I have otherwise we wouldn't have known. 
 Known what? 
 For God's sake! 
 Bloody Twitter! 
 These people's lives have been destroyed and now our incompetence has made it worse. 
 Think what we have to do now to rebuild trust there. 
 Who told the journalist? 
 I think it might have been me. 
 Your nephew? 
 He saw Danny's sister at the beach. 
 I didn't tell him anything. I told him not to publish. He's a little sh1t. 
 I'll read the riot act and I'll explain to the family. 
 Go away. 
 sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t! sh1t! 
 Hi, Nick. 
 Ma'am. 
 This is a short statement to confirm that this morning the body of an 11-year-old child was found on Harbour Cliff Beach at Broadchurch. 
 The body was subsequently identified as Daniel Latimer, who lived in the town. 
 We are treating his death as suspicious. 
 Our investigations are continuing and there'll be a full briefing later this evening. 
 We ask the media respect the family's privacy at this time. Thank you. 
 Can you believe it? 
 He got another job even after Sandbrook. 
 Boss... Suspicious death. 
 Kid on Dorset beach. 
 Gender? Age? 
 Boy. 11. 
 I want to go down. There could be... 
 Not for that. It's the wrong profile. 
 It'll cost too much. 
 Let an agency do it. You can jazz it up. 
 Oh, come on, all I'm doing these days is polishing press releases. 
 Pretty please. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Long day? 
 Yeah. 
 It's really tragic. 
 Can't bear to think what the family must be going through. We're all in shock. 
 Actually, do you think the beach will be open tomorrow? I... 
 Only so I know what to tell the guests. I don't know. 
 I've had an early check-out and a cancellation just tonight. So... 
 I'm going up. 
 Oh, sorry, there's two people waiting for you in the bar. 
 Well, go on. 
 I was wrong to post that news. I'm sorry. 
 I should hang him by the bollocks from the town hall spire. 
 All reporting on this will come through me now. 
 The Echo works with the police. 
 I'll... I'll speak to the Latimer family. 
 Give them our apologies. 
 Stay out of my way. 
 Thanks for bringing me. 
 I used to come down here when he was a baby. 
 Middle of the day, just me and him. 
 I'd pick him up and dip him in the waves. 
 His little fat legs would be all wet. 
 God, he loved it. He laughed like mad. 
 I used to do the same with Tom. 
 Does he know? 
 Promise me, Ellie, because... 
 I don't know your boss from Adam and me and you go back... 
 The boys go back. 
 I'm counting on you to get them caught. 
 I swear. 
 He did know, didn't he? 
 That I loved him. 
 Of course he did. 
 He was a beautiful boy, Beth. 
 You don't deserve this. 
 I just... I just feel... like... very far away from myself. 
 Here's Mummy! 
 Look at you still up. 
 And eating yoghurt. 
 You love yoghurt, especially wearing it. 
 I'm only here for a shower. 
 I've got to get back. 
 Are things bad? 
 Need a hug? 
 How was your day? 
 Or shouldn't I ask? 
 Second go at tea. First one was a bit of an apocalypse, wasn't it? 
 Thank you, Mummy. 
 And I'm still smiling. 
 Oh, no, Mummy. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's Tom? 
 In bed. 
 Does he know? 
 No. 
 I got the text, kept him away from it all. 
 I can't... 
 Do you know what happened? Should we be worried, for other kids? 
 Don't know yet. 
 I'll go up and tell him in a minute. 
 How's the new boss? 
 Come here. 
 It's all right. 
 It's not all right. 
 Come here. 
 I saw him lying there. I don't think I can do this. 
 You can. 
 I keep thinking he's going to walk back in. 
 Every time my phone goes, I think it's Danny. 
 Why didn't you look in on him last night? 
 Beth... 
 You always look in on him when you come to bed. Why didn't you see he was gone? 
 Why didn't you? 
 Where were you last night? 
 I told you. I was on a job. 
 You know Danny wasn't at school today? 
 Yeah. 
 Tom, sweetheart... 
 Danny died. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 How? 
 I don't know yet. 
 He was found on the beach early this morning. 
 Does his mum and dad know? 
 Yeah. 
 So, look, when... 
 When someone dies unexpectedly... it leaves a big hole. 
 And it's all right to be sad or to have a cry, OK? 
 OK. 
 Will you...? I mean... 
 Will the police want to ask me questions? 
 Yeah. 
 Is there anything you want to tell me now? 
 Was Danny all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Of course. 
 I think a hug's a good idea. 
 You know I love you more than anything? 
 More than chocolate? 
 Even more than chocolate. 
 I'll be just downstairs. 
 And don't be embarrassed to have that cry. 
 Hello? 
 Hi, Olly. It's Karen White from the Daily Herald. 
 Oh, um, hi. 
 I saw you broke the story about Danny Latimer. 
 I'm down here after a hotel recommendation. 
 Oh, right, OK. Where are you at the moment? 
 The beach. 
 I see people have started leaving flowers. 
 Danny's sister left one of his toys down there. It must have started it. 
 Um, OK, so your best option is the Traders Hotel. 
 It's opposite our offices on the high street. 
 Becca runs it. Tell her you know us, she'll give you a good rate. 
 Great. Thanks. 
 I'll maybe see you around. 
 Yeah, I hope so, yeah. 
 I mean, that would... 
 Who are you putting up at the Traders? 
 No-one. A girl, woman. 
 Oh, a woman? 
 I'm off to the media briefing at the school. Good luck. 
 Not that you... 
 I know. 
 Different suit? 
 Press conference in 10 minutes. 
 Look at this. CCTV from town centre last night. 
 Is that Danny? 
 It matches his clothes, height. It looks like his skateboard. 
 He wasn't abducted. 
 He snuck out. 
 Why? Where was he going? 
 Who was he meeting? 
 And where's his skateboard? 
 Yeah. 
 I was checking through the list of belongings recovered from Danny's body and at home and there's no mobile phone. 
 He definitely had one. He and Tom, my son, had the same model, virtually identical. 
 It isn't there? 
 No. 
 Check with the family. 
 Good. 
 I'm going to hand over now to our senior investigating officer DI Alec Hardy. 
 What advice do you have for people in the town, particularly parents? 
 The crime rate in this area is one of the lowest in the country. 
 This is a terrible anomaly. 
 We are in the early moments of what might be a complex investigation. 
 Danny's life touched many people and we'll be looking at all those connections. 
 If you or someone you know has any information, has noticed anything unusual, please come forward now. 
 Um, I'd urge everyone, don't hide anything... because we will find out. 
 If a member of your family or a friend or a neighbour has been behaving differently in the past days or weeks, please tell the police immediately. 
 There will be no hiding place for Danny's killer. We will catch whoever did this.
