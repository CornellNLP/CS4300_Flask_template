 'Previously on Broadchurch...' 
 How do you plead? 
 Not guilty. 
 No! 
 I'll do everything I can to secure a conviction, but it's not just down to me. It's on everyone in this town. 
 "It's already way past midnight." 
 Oh, damn! 
 (BRAKES SCREECH) 
 This investigation was compromised by your personal liaisons with DI Hardy. 
 I am NOT the guilty one here! I am not! 
 Alec : There are two families back in Sandbrook. 
 The Gillespies still don't know who killed their daughter. The Newberys don't even have a body. 
 You got DI Hardy in charge? 
 Yeah. 
 My daughter's killer is still out there because of that man! 
 Ricky and David Gillespie. Dads to the two girls. 
 Two dads - two brothers you barely even looked at. 
 Why did you send Claire a bluebell? 
 Claire, what happened that night? 
 He drugged me. 
 I woke up at 5am and he was cleaning the whole house.

 (POIGNANT MUSIC) 
 (SOBS) 
 (SEAGULLS CRY) 
 Yeah, still holding for Mr Davies. 
 No, no, I don't want to reschedule. I want to erm... talk to him about an increase in my symptoms. 
 What, is he some higher mortal who doesn't phone people (?) 
 My GP? Seriously? For... 
 (TO HIMSELF) Oh, God, what do you want? (KNOCKS AT DOOR) 
 Lee Ashworth came into our offices the other day. 
 Now, I couldn't place him at first, but then... I went through all the Sandbrook press cuttings. 
 It's a bit of a coincidence, you and him both here. 
 Does your editor know you're here? 
 I'm a bit fed up with the way you talk to me. 
 Is he dangerous? Why's he here? I think you know. 
 Leave this alone. 
 Why? He might have a story to tell. 
 I'm just doing you the courtesy of asking you first. 
 You people think you're saving the world. 
 You just make it harder to live in. 
 Piss off! Go on. 
 Did you, though? 
 Did I what? 
 Shag him. "Oh, harder, Hardy" (!) 
 I didn't go near him! I wouldn't. Have you seen him? 
 I quite like the look of him. 
 I like a troubled man. Not as troubled as you do, but - 
 None of it is true. Make sure everybody understands that. 
 Oh, who cares! Everyone knows what a trial's like. 
 No, they don't. 
 They don't know what it's like until you're up there, telling the truth and being painted as a liar. 
 It's my turn this morning. Any tips? 
 Just stick to the facts. 
 I saw Joe that night. 
 No, you saw a man who you didn't name. Don't go adding stuff. 
 We both know it was him, Ell, and I'm the only one who saw him that night. 
 Just stick to the truth and you'll be fine. 
 Good, hoped I'd catch you. How are you feeling? Any sign of the whiplash? 
 Why didn't we know that DS Miller visited DI Hardy's hotel room? 
 Who did they talk to that we didn't? 
 I am not sure. 
 Well, you should be. 
 I'm not going to lose this case because my... junior isn't on every detail. 
 I did actually - 
 Well, you have to be better. No fact unchecked, no detail too small. 
 Understood. 
 I'm a prizefighter. I'm Willie Pep... 
 .. and Willie Pep never liked taking punches. 
 Sorry, Willie who? 
 Everything you need to know about a trial can be found in the boxing ring. Now, you study boxing, you'll see who Willie Pep is. 
 OK. 
 After Lucy Stevens, I want to close by giving the defence a bloody mouth. 
 Now, how am I gonna do that, Ben? 
 Actually, that's what I came to tell you. 
 I think we might've found someone. 
 Why didn't you wake me? I'm gonna miss the start of court. 
 Thought you needed the sleep. Here you are, sit down and I'll make you a tea. 
 What's got into you, cheery? 
 Me and Lizzie watched the sunrise. 
 You took her out? 
 Yeah. Movement of the car sends her to sleep. 
 Then we just sat there. It was beautiful, Beth. 
 Wow. Good for you. 
 Yeah, and I've been thinking about... 
 Well, about a bit of time off, you know? My paternity leave. 
 Your what? 
 I could take a few weeks, or something, or... a month - maybe more. 
 What's brought this on? 
 I missed it, with Chloe and Dan, didn't I? The whole thing. 
 All that sitting around and spending time, and watching and feeding and... changing nappies, even. It don't come again, does it? 
 I want to hold onto it this time. 
 (DISTANT CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER) 
 Oh, bloody hell! 
 Here you go. I've got it. 
 I hope you're not following me. 
 Says the woman who had me recorded (!) 
 I heard they trashed you in court. 
 Hurts, doesn't it? 
 Yeah, well, I'm sure the jury saw through it. 
 It's like a game to them. 
 Don't care about you, what you've lost: husband, son, job - 
 I haven't lost my son and now I'm running late. 
 Hardy slept with my wife. 
 That's why he's so obsessed with the case. 
 What's that got to do with me? 
 He's poisoned my own wife against me, even though I tried to help him solve it. 
 I just want Claire back. 
 Well, I've talked to her. Stay away from her. You are not good for her. 
 He paid for your parking? 
 He said you slept with Claire Ripley. 
 I'm going up there, Miller. 
 Where? 
 Sandbrook, this weekend. You can drive me. 
 What? No, I'm not a taxi! 
 I've got better things to do! 
 There is an officer there I can talk to about reopening the case. 
 See the place for yourself. Leave wee... 
 Fred! 
 Fred with your sister. 
 I'd been playing a bit of online poker... and then I went to the window to close the curtains. 
 What time was this? 
 4:47am. I checked it on the computer. 
 And what did you see when you went to the window to close the curtains? 
 A man putting a bag into a bin across the street. 
 Can you describe the man? 
 I saw the defendant, Joe Miller. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 You're certain of the man's identity? 
 He's my brother-in-law, I should be able to recognise him. 
 Your statement to the police stated that you couldn't identify the person you saw. 
 No, I did tell them. Not sure why they didn't put it in the statement. 
 (What is she doing?) 
 (I wish I knew.) 
 Thank you. 
 We'll need the officer who took this statement. 
 Looking at the date of your statement, Miss Stevens, you didn't go to the police until 57 days after seeing the man you claim to be the defendant. 
 I didn't connect it to Danny's death until a few weeks later. 
 Really? Despite it being the talk of your town? 
 Despite your own sister being one of the investigating officers? 
 I know this is everyday for you, but the rest of us haven't lived through this before. It was new. 
 The facts of your evidence are: finally you make a statement, 
 57 days after having seen a figure on a dark street, but you forget to name the man you claim to have seen. 
 I didn't forget, the police didn't put it in the - 
 And today, for the first time, you say it was Joe Miller. 
 You're having the court on, aren't you? 
 I know what I saw. 
 You might have seen a man, but you didn't see the defendant, did you? 
 Why have you changed your story? 
 I know what my own brother-in-law looks like, and I'd know him from miles off. 
 I saw him out there that night. 
 Come on, how was that? Did I play a blinder, or what? 
 I can't even talk to you. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 How are you getting on with that new bad-character evidence? 
 She's done it deliberately. New witness, late notice... 
 (SIGHS) Not enough grounds for us to successfully object. 
 Sneaky move! I'd be impressed if I wasn't so irritated. 
 They claim they've only just found her. 
 Yeah, right (!) 
 Jocelyn likes to end big. Lodge a point in the mind of the jury. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 Woman : Mr Miller and I worked for two years together, between 1996 and 1998. 
 We were shift partners working as paramedics at Cardiff City Hospital. 
 Can you describe Mr Miller as a colleague? 
 A bit quiet, kept himself to himself. 
 When did you stop working together? 
 It was November 1998, two days after Bonfire Night, and it was at my request. 
 Why did you request it? 
 Joe had offered to give me a lift to get some shopping. 
 The supermarket car park was really busy. Then he saw a space, but this bloke in a BMW came in the other way, the wrong way, and got in ahead of him. 
 What did the defendant do then? 
 He jumped out the car, ran across and punched the guy in the face. 
 The bloke fell back against the car and Joe started kicking him, going at him really hard! 
 Did you try and stop him? 
 When I realised what was going on, yeah. 
 By the time I got there though, the guy was bleeding. 
 He ended up with three broken ribs and it took four people to pull Joe off him. 
 Had there been any warning signs that Mr Miller might have a violent tendency? 
 Nothing. It came out of nowhere. 
 Thank you. 
 Is it a high-pressure job being a paramedic? 
 It can be... but on that day, we had a good run and even had some time off. 
 How many lives did Mr Miller save in the two years that you worked together? 
 I don't know. 
 Two, three? 
 More like 50 or 60. 
 It doesn't make what he did right, though. 
 But you never saw any sign of this behaviour before that day? 
 He blew. I saw him go. It was like a switch had been flipped in him. 
 Thank you. 
 Scared the life out of me. He nearly killed that guy! 
 Thank you! 
 Willie Pep: 241 fights, 229 wins. 
 Reportedly claimed he could win a fight without throwing a single punch. 
 Jocelyn : That concludes the case for the Crown, My Lady. 
 (BIRDSONG) 
 I'll be away one night, maybe two. I've asked Bob from the station to pass by twice a day. 
 This is his number - you call him if you're worried about anything at all. 
 You still mad at me? 
 What about Ellie - why can't she stay with me? 
 She's coming with me. 
 Oh. Dirty weekend away (?) 
 When I get back, we'll talk about what we do next. 
 Just remember - don't go near him. He's not good for you. 
 Take it. Go on. Lock all the doors. 
 (STARTS UP ENGINE) 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC) 
 (MUSIC SWELLS) 
 How did you sleep? 
 Crap. Annoyed about those last two witnesses. I wasn't quick enough on my feet. 
 You did fine. 
 No, I didn't. Still, there's plenty of time left. 
 Now, strategy. 
 Hm! 
 When it boiled down to it, what did they have? 
 Forensics from the hut. 
 Er... pathology which doesn't rule our man out or conclusively prove that he did it. 
 That's right. 
 Email and phone trails from Joe to Danny, Danny's phone in Joe's possession... and the sister's supposed sighting. 
 Oh, don't start me off on that! 
 Right. (CHUCKLES) 
 So our big decision is, do we put Joe Miller in the box? 
 Jury will probably read into it if we don't. 
 But then we're at the mercy of his performance. 
 Plus Jocelyn - I don't want her having a run at him. 
 How watertight is his account of that night? 
 Says he was in bed, next to his wife. 
 But she can't corroborate, because she took a sleeping pill. 
 She can't say he wasn't there. 
 Let's try him out, you and me, see how he does. 
 Oh, we also need an alternate killer. Who do you fancy? Some juicy possibilities! 
 Abby, do you ever listen to yourself? 
 What? 
 These are people's lives you're talking about. Have some sensitivity. 
 Of course. 
 Absolutely. But, due respect, we do need a credible alternative. Who do you think's best placed? 
 I'd have thought that was pretty obvious. 
 (SEAGULLS CRY) 
 (POIGNANT MUSIC) 
 I remember, when Fred was this small, he used to grip my thumb in his hand. 
 Yeah, Tom, mate, I think we need to have a chat. 
 I er... I can't go on meeting you here, mate. 
 Why not? 
 Well, with the baby, I just... 
 You know, I don't have the same amount of time. I need to think about her now, don't I? 
 (VOICE BREAKS) Well... maybe we could just meet less often? 
 I don't think so. 
 And people will start getting the wrong idea, you know? I haven't really been thinking straight. 
 I'm sorry. 
 So that's it, then? 
 You're just gonna leave me? Like my dad, like... like my mum? 
 Your mum hasn't left you. She's not left. You should talk to her. 
 Go. 
 I'm sorry - 
 Just go, OK? 
 (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) 
 Do you like lasagne? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 It's a long time since somebody cooked for me. Well, thank you. 
 How do you think we're doing? 
 We've put in a strong case. (SIGHS) Hold your nerve, Beth. 
 We are gonna win, aren't we? 
 Of course we are. 
 What made you change your mind? Why did you take the case? 
 Joe Miller found himself a Rottweiler to defend him. Hm! 
 She knows how to play the system. 
 And your Danny... he used to deliver my newspaper. 
 This was on his round? 
 He was a good boy. Someone has to speak for him. 
 Where were you on the night that Daniel Latimer was murdered, Mr Miller? 
 I was at home in bed with my wife. 
 Did you have any contact with Daniel Latimer the previous morning? 
 No. 
 Did you send him a text message when you returned from holiday? 
 No. 
 We have your phone records which show that a text message was sent from your phone. 
 Not by me. 
 Then who? 
 I don't know. My wife. 
 Then why were your DNA and prints found on the phone used to send the text message? 
 I don't know. 
 How did you get to the hut that night? 
 I didn't go to the hut. 
 What did you use to clean the hut? 
 I didn't clean the hut. 
 Why did you decide to move Danny's body from the murder scene? 
 I wasn't... 
 I didn't move it at all. I hadn't seen him for days, weeks... 
 Is it days or is it weeks? 
 Weeks. 
 We were on holiday. Three weeks. 
 How many times did you meet Danny before that night? 
 I don't know. 
 I didn't meet him. We never met. We never met there. He was just a friend of my son's. 
 OK. He's a disaster. We can't put him in the box. 
 We're gonna need a parade of character witnesses and experts, each one short, sharp, fully briefed. 
 We can't prove his innocence, so we discredit the idea of his guilt. 
 sh1t, Sharon, he totally did it. 
 Don't. I don't ever want to hear you speak like that. 
 We don't know for sure. He gets his defence. 
 Yes. Sorry. 
 Look at us, Thelma and Louise! You can be Susan Sarandon. 
 (RAPIDLY SWITCHES FREQUENCIES ON RADIO) 
 Leave the radio alone! If you can't find anything you like, just turn it off. 
 (RADIO OFF) 
 Right, so if we're not having music, you can at least tell me your theory. 
 With everything you know, what do you reckon happened at Sandbrook? 
 Someone went into the Gillespie house, abducted both girls. 
 Got rid of the bodies. 
 Why Lee Ashworth? 
 Ricky and Cate Gillespie said Pippa always used to like going next door to see Lee. 
 If Ashworth was in their house, there must've been forensics. 
 Yeah, there were. Ashworth's DNA was all over the place. 
 A strand of his hair was found on Pippa's pillow. 
 What was his argument? 
 That he'd been in the house plenty of times, which is true, but... he still wouldn't say how the hair got on the pillow. 
 At one stage, he said it had been put there to frame him. 
 By who? This... Ricky, Pippa's Dad? 
 That's what Ashworth claimed. 
 But this case, Miller, whenever you think you're getting close, it slips away from you. 
 Is that why it got to you - cos you could never be sure? 
 I found her - Pippa Gillespie. She was in the river. 
 (SOMBRE MUSIC) 
 And it were deeper than I thought. I got pulled under. 
 (GROANS AND GURGLES) 
 Just managed to get free and carry her body onto the bank. 
 She'd been in there maybe three days. 
 Water rots the body. 
 She was the same age as my daughter. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I can still feel the weight of her, water dripping off her clothes all down me. 
 What sort of a person leaves a child like that? 
 
 
 
 Mr Ashworth! Lee, right? 
 Who are you? 
 Er, Olly Stevens, Broadchurch Echo. I saw you when you came in to place your ad. 
 I didn't give my name. 
 Yeah, well, I get why. I recognised you. I know a bit about your case. 
 I don't want to talk to you. 
 Why did you come down here? 
 I don't want to talk to you. 
 Cos DI Hardy's here? 
 Was I not clear? 
 Don't you want to put your side of the story? 
 No, I don't. 
 One conversation - five minutes, here, now. Clear your name, everyone moves on. 
 Our readers would love to hear what you have to say. 
 You need to leave - now. 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC) 
 I keep replaying my evidence over and over, thinking of all the things I should've said differently, all the comebacks I should've thrown at her. 
 You did the best you could. 
 There's an epitaph - "Ellie Miller, she did the best she could" (!) 
 What if Joe gets off? 
 He won't. 
 What if he does? 
 He won't, Miller. 
 I don't know what I'd do. 
 First left, second right. 
 Down here on the left. 
 Yeah, this pair here. 
 Who lives there now? 
 The Gillespies own both houses. 
 They rented the one on the right to Lee and Claire. Cate still lives in the one on the left. 
 Even after everything that's gone on? 
 She wanted to be there, in case Lisa came back. 
 Let's go to the hotel.

 How can they have just lost your booking? 
 Shut up, at least we got the last room! 
 I'll sleep in the car. 
 Don't be daft. 
 If Joe's legal team found out - 
 So? They've already accused us of it. 
 Don't be stupid. Especially not in your condition. 
 It's not a condition! 
 It totally is. 
 Look, it's been a long drive. We'll just take half the bed each. 
 I'll sleep under the covers, you sleep on top. Just don't snore. 
 How is it? 
 (POIGNANT MUSIC) 
 You're on the covers. 
 Sorry. 
 Thanks. 
 Shall I turn the light off? 
 (SIGHS) 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Bit weird. 
 You never answered me. Did you ever have s*x with Claire Ripley? 
 Go to sleep, Miller.

 What are you doing here? 
 You've been using this place a lot, have you? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, you can't, now I've come back. I don't want visitors. 
 He don't usually remember people. 
 Why did you leave? 
 What's it got to do with you? 
 Well, they arrested my Dad for killing Danny. 
 I heard about that. 
 He says he's innocent. 
 They all say that. 
 How's your Mum? 
 I'm... I... live with my aunt now. 
 That doesn't sound right. 
 Go on, then. Off you go. 
 How many men have you slept with since I left? 
 None. 
 Are you sure? 
 I think I'd remember. 
 What about you? 
 Same. 
 (SCOFFS GENTLY) Really? 
 No s*x with any men. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 And women? 
 Do French girls count? 
 Cheeky b*st*rd! 
 I came back for you. 
 What's gonna happen to us? 
 What have you told them? 
 Nothing. 
 You'd better be telling the truth, Claire. 
 Will you tie me up this time? 
 How am I meant to get in there? 
 I made a copy before I handed the originals back. 
 No! 
 You've read the files. You've met Lee and Claire. Have a look around and see what you think. 
 What are YOU gonna do? 
 Cate, please don't slam the door. 
 What do you want? 
 Five minutes. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 Alec : (MUFFLED) I still haven't given up on you or the case. 
 Erm, I came because I thought you should hear this from me. 
 Lee Ashworth is back in the country. 
 Where? 
 Nowhere near here. I'm keeping him under observation. 
 If I see him, I'll kill him. 
 I know. 
 I was sorry to hear about you and Ricky. 
 (SIGHS) It was a long time coming. 
 Well, going through something like this... 
 We were broken before then. 
 All that cock of the walk, "every woman loves me" bullshit... 
 Only so much any woman could take. 
 Even over the fence, when he knew I was watching, with Claire. 
 He'd check I could see. 
 I'm sorry, you never told us - 
 Even the moment his daughter was being killed... 
 At the wedding? 
 You were at the wedding together? 
 He was shagging one of the bridesmaids - Tiffany Evans. 
 You always said you were together that night. You never mentioned - 
 What did it have to do with you? 
 Makes no difference now, anyway. 
 I will get you justice. 
 It's too late. 
 It's not. 
 (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) 
 (SIGHS) Sorry, sorry! Got held up. 
 No, no, you're fine. We just got here. This is Miller. 
 Ellie. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, sorry, I didn't realise that - 
 We work together. Worked together. 
 Oh, you're Joe Miller's wife. The Broadchurch case. 
 Right. Yep. 
 I feel like I'm playing catch-up here. 
 It's about Sandbrook. 
 Tell me that's not why you're here. 
 Hear me out. Lee Ashworth is back in the country. 
 He's staying near me. There's grounds for reopening the case. 
 Don't do this. 
 Potential new evidence - a pressed bluebell sent to Claire Ripley anonymously. 
 Plus, Miller, tell her what she told you about that night. 
 Claire said that, the night the girls went missing, Lee drugged her with Rohypnol. 
 She slept all night. When she woke up, he was cleaning the place. 
 So Claire Ripley's down there with you, too? 
 She's changed her story. 
 Has she made a statement? 
 We were just talking. 
 Would she give a statement? 
 I haven't asked her. 
 Couple of officers, that's all I need. Some surveillance - 
 You're not even on active duty! 
 Unless we have a genuinely significant new lead, there's just no appetite to - 
 At least talk to your superiors. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 How can you imagine I'd want to go back to it after what it did to us? 
 Oh, God, you're his wife. 
 He didn't tell you? 
 Huh! Of course he didn't. Why am I even surprised? 
 He said we were meeting the officer who could reopen the case. 
 I could, but I won't. 
 A girl's body is still missing. A killer's walking free. 
 There's families who don't have closure and you won't reopen it because of what? 
 Internal politics? Or... or personal inconvenience? 
 Don't take the moral high ground with me. 
 Me take the moral high ground? 
 You built a bloody house there! 
 I see the families every month. I write, phone and visit. 
 I didn't run! 
 I had no choice. No-one stood up for me. 
 Maybe you should've made more friends. 
 Like you and Dave (?) 
 Right, I'm gonna leave. 
 Don't be late for dinner. Daisy's looking forward to it. 
 Nice to meet you. Good luck with the trial. 
 Unbelievable. 
 What I thought was, a charity to help kids make that transition to secondary school. 
 That time when they're growing up, but really are still kids inside. 
 That age when they start keeping secrets. 
 We could create packs, do a website and set up a phone line. 
 That's great, but there are places that already do it. 
 Look, Beth, to get funding for anything, in this climate, you need a unique proposition. 
 I'm sorry, petal. 
 Oh, I'm not gonna stop. There's gonna be a charity in Danny's name. 
 Well, the three of us were talking before we got here and... there's a small group. They're new, but they do the most challenging work. 
 What sort of work? 
 They work with known s*x offenders. 
 Those who've targeted children. They provide support, to stop offenders reoffending. 
 Rehabilitate for the long term. 
 So Danny's legacy would be helping the sort of man who murdered him? 
 If you want to prevent children being targeted, you stop the people targeting them. 
 This is where the help's needed, because this is where most people are too afraid to go. 
 But you're different, Beth. You're brave. 
 I'm not. 
 I can't do that. I'm not that forgiving. 
 (SEAGULLS CRY) 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC) 
 You took your time! 
 You're lucky I'm here at all. 
 How've you been? 
 How've I been? Are you kidding me? I was in a cell because of you. 
 You just left! 
 I'm dying. 
 What? 
 Got cancer. They've given me nine months. 
 My lungs are done in. 
 No.... no, you're lying. 
 Nice (!) 
 I don't believe a single word that comes out your mouth. 
 We got tangled up in that boy's death. 
 We don't have to carry on like that. We can make peace, you and me. 
 Why? 
 Because you don't turn on your family! 
 I ain't your family. 
 (DRAMATIC MUSIC) 
 (MUSIC SWELLS) 
 Have you got anything that isn't chicken? 
 There's spicy bean burger. 
 Oh, God, no. 
 Or a salad? 
 Dad, it's a chicken joint. 
 I just don't really fancy it. 
 See? 
 What? 
 Mum said you'd be fussy. 
 I'm not! Erm, just bring me what they're having, thanks. 
 So, how's school? 
 Pretty sh1t. 
 Oh, we use words like that now, do we? 
 Don't look at me! 
 I've been fighting this for the past 18 months. 
 Dad, "sh1t" is not swearing. 
 Erm, it is! 
 Ah, thank you. See? 
 No, it's not! Look at you both. You have no idea. I'm gonna get my drink. 
 Oh, God, she's older, isn't she? 
 Not just in days, but her manner and the way she dresses... 
 She's not a little girl any more. 
 Yeah... 
 I missed her change. 
 Yes, you did. 
 Let the case go, Alec. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 Have you given him the bollocking, or shall I? 
 Ricky. Did you tell him I was here? 
 Ricky called me earlier to lodge a complaint of harassment against you and - 
 You leave Cate alone. She's too fragile. 
 We all want the truth. 
 We had the truth and you screwed it up for us. 
 You're a failure! You can never put it right. 
 What's going on? 
 Is this your girl? 
 How old are you, sweetheart? 
 15. 
 I had a girl like you. 
 She was murdered... and, thanks to your dad, a man's still free. 
 All right. 
 When you go this time, you stay gone. 
 There's nothing for you here. 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC) 
 (ROAR OF TRAFFIC) 
 (SILENCE) 
 I've just driven through the night and you've not said a word. 
 What's bothering you? 
 Ricky Gillespie. 
 Why would a father not want an investigation to restart into the death of his own daughter? 
 What if Lee Ashworth didn't do it? What if he's been telling the truth? 
 What if I've been wrong? 
 Oh, my God, I meant to tell you. When Claire and I went out drinking, I checked her phone - the one you gave her. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, firstly, all the Internet searches are about Lee: "Lee Ashworth killer". Bit odd. 
 Second? 
 And she only had two numbers in her phone. 
 First one was yours. The other I didn't recognise. 
 Oh, I've put it in my phone, hang on. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 (DISTANT DRILLING) 
 No, it's just ringing out. 
 Right, come on, we're late. 
 You posted this this morning? 
 Yeah. 
 Without running it past me? 
 Without even telling me? 
 It's online only. You said I could post online only. 
 You are getting above your station! 
 Hey, defence aren't calling Joe. 
 What? Why not? 
 Clerk : All rise! 
 I didn't know. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 The defence calls Susan Wright. 
 (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) 
 (This is everything I could find.) 
 Would you please give your full name to the court? 
 Susan Wright. 
 And you were living at Tides Caravan Park on July 18th 2013? 
 I was. 
 Miss Wright, where were you in the early hours of the morning... 
 You all right, Jocelyn? 
 Yeah. 
 .. 2013? 
 I was walking my dog Vince on the beach at Broadchurch. 
 I've a caravan nearby. 
 And did you see anything significant on the beach that morning? 
 I saw a boat come in... 
 .. and a man carrying the body of a young boy. 
 Then he laid it on the beach. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 'Did you recognise the man carrying the body?' 
 'Yeah, I did.' 
 'And can you name that man for the court?' 
 Nigel Carter. He's my son... and he's sitting over there.
