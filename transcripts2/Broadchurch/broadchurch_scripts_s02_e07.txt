 Previously on Broadchurch - 
 I'm going into hospital - pacemaker. 
 If anything happens, I've made a will. 
 Your mother had a fall. 
 I-I'm afraid she passed away. 
 Jonah, say something! 
 Why can't you get me out of here? 
 I was saying it was over, I'd met someone else, our marriage was done. 
 Why are we together? Is it just cos Danny died? 
 No. 
 If it is, don't bother. 
 If this trial collapses, it's because of you. 
 I think I might have something. Could be juicy. 
 Look at that stuff. Look at the Gillespies. 
 Look at that bloke hanging around the estate. 
 Do your remember doing work for Thorp Agri Services? 
 Don't think so. 
 When I see him, I lose myself. 
 I need you to move out. I'm giving you 48 hours. 
 You can't do that. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Claire Ripley showed me a photograph. 
 She was wearing Pippa's pendant. 
 You go about your life thinking you're complete, then you meet someone and realise you're only half of something. 
 People laugh about it. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 'Have you met my other half?' 
 Then when you meet that person... you know it's true. 
 You're only really whole when you're with each other. 
 Never ends well, does it? 
 Alec : What doesn't? 
 Love. 
 It makes you strong and... then it pulls you down. 
 However it happens... one half always loses the other. 
 It's OK. 
 No, it's not. 
 It's all right. 
 No, it's not. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 What's going on? 
 Morning. Cup of tea? 
 Claire's gone from the house. 
 Then I found a pile of ash in the sink, presumably from where she burnt the photograph of herself wearing this pendant. 
 You're saying Pippa's pendant actually belonged to Claire? 
 Well, Claire was wearing it in the photograph I saw. 
 Tea. 
 So she must have given it to Pippa at some point. 
 And now she's burnt the photo. She's panicking. 
 That's good. I like it when they panic. 
 Claire kills the girls and Lee covers for her? 
 What would be her motive? 
 Unless she was grooming Pippa for Lee. 
 I knew I'd seen this name before - Gary Thorp. 
 He runs that incinerator business Thorp Agri Services. 
 He was on the invite list to the wedding Ricky and Kate went to. 
 RSVP'd yes, didn't turn up. 
 Does he know Ricky and Kate? We haven't talked to him? 
 There was no connection until now. I'll get on to it. 
 It doesn't mean we'll reopen the case. 
 What are you two gonna do? 
 Miller is gonna give Claire one last chance to confess. 
 Am I? 
 Aye, you are. 
 We're gonna set a fire under her. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 (PHONE BEEPS) 
 Hello? 
 Ellie : Hi, it's me. Where are you? 
 Like you care. 
 I saw the photograph, Claire. 
 Why were you wearing a pendant belonging to Pippa Gillespie? 
 (SIGHS) It wasn't Pippa's. 
 It was mine. 
 My gran gave it to me. 
 Why did Pippa Gillespie have it? Why did you burn the photograph? 
 Do you know, I am... 
 I am sick and tired of my life being defined by this, Ellie. 
 I keep being dragged into something I had nothing to do with. 
 Why do you still keep secrets from us? 
 The truth doesn't help. 
 It gives peace to the families involved. 
 You think so? 
 Your friends, the parents of that boy your husband killed... are they at peace now? 
 No, I didn't think so. 
 OK, Lisa Newbury - we need to know if she's dead or alive, if there's a body to be found. 
 I had a life, Ellie, and it was destroyed in the ripples. 
 They just keep coming at me. 
 When is it ever gonna stop? 
 Where's Claire? 
 Don't you know? 
 She's left the cottage. 
 What did she do that for? 
 Anyway, I came to say thank you. 
 For what? 
 South Mercia Constabulary have authorised the Sandbrook investigation to be re-opened. 
 New leads, new evidence. 
 Couldn't have it without you, that information you gave me. 
 Not gonna take long to wrap it up now. 
 Are you all right? There's something different about you. 
 I'm more than all right, Lee. 
 I'm reborn. 
 (CHUCKLES) What? 
 I thought this case would kill me. 
 I thought I would die not knowing, having failed. 
 Then I had my operation. 
 After it, when I woke up... and I was alive, and I didn't expect to be alive... know the first thing I felt? 
 What? 
 Angry. 
 Really, properly angry. 
 For the Gillespies, for Pippa, for Lisa. 
 I hadn't felt that angry in years. That is a beautiful feeling. I was... 
 I was worn down, I was tired, I was beaten. 
 Now I've got a new lease of life. 
 Whereas you, of course, look at you - you're exhausted. 
 Sick of running. 
 Sick of not being able to escape what happened. 
 I get that. 
 You don't get anything about me. 
 What I don't get... is whether you're lying to protect yourself or someone else. 
 Presumably Claire. 
 I'd always thought she was lying to protect you. 
 Maybe it's the other way round. 
 You can't trust her. 
 You're wrong. 
 Am I? 
 She ever tell you she was pregnant? 
 When? 
 Judging by the dates - before the night Lisa and Pippa went missing - so all the time you were in custody. 
 You're lying. 
 Ask her. 
 So what happened to it? 
 It's OK. 
 No, it's - 
 It's all right. 
 No, it's not. 
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 If he ever finds out about this... 
 Why don't you ask her? 
 Hurry up. Last day of evidence. 
 Should I move out? 
 Oh... Do you want to? Where would you go? 
 I don't know. 
 I didn't say, 'Leave,' I said, 'I need you to change.' 
 Yeah, what if I can't? 
 Stop thinking of life as something that happens to you. 
 What we do now, that's who we are. 
 You said you didn't need me. 
 I said I can be alone if I have to. 
 You need to decide if we matter enough for you to change. 
 Man : Mark and Beth... 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Ms Bishop, I believe you have an application to make. 
 The defence wishes to recall former Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller as a witness for the defence. 
 My Lady, I apply to treat DS Miller as a hostile witness. 
 How close are you to your sister? 
 Lucy? Pretty close. 
 We have our disagreements, you know, family. 
 At the end of the investigation into Danny Latimer's death, were you aware she'd racked up substantial gambling debts? 
 I became aware, yeah. 
 How did you become aware? 
 Lucy told me she was in trouble. 
 Did she ask for help with the debts? 
 She did, I refused. 
 On the day that your husband, the defendant, was arrested, you wrote a cheque from the joint-account you hold with your husband for £1,000, made payable to your sister. 
 Is that correct? 
 What made you change your mind about helping her? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know why you suddenly gave your sister £1,000? 
 She was desperate. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 It was YOU that was desperate, wasn't it? 
 Later that day, according to your police notebook, you told DI Hardy that your sister had given a statement describing a man conveniently matching the description of the defendant dumping clothes into a bin the night of Danny's death. 
 Did you bribe your sister to fabricate evidence against your husband? 
 No, I didn't. 
 You bribed a witness to implicate your husband so that you could fix a failing investigation and continue your affair with DI Hardy. 
 Isn't that true? 
 Not a single word of this is true! 
 I lent her money to help - 
 Not 'lent', 'bribed'! 
 On the condition that she help you frame your husband. 
 Nobody framed Joe. He killed Danny, he confessed. 
 After you beat him up, or before? 
 Don't listen to her! 
 Everybody knows he killed Danny and I wish I'd been able to stop him! 
 Don't lecture the jury, PC Miller. Your job is to answer the question. 
 No further questions, m'lady. 
 (SIGHS) 
 That concludes the case for the defence. 
 No, no, Miller back in the car. 
 What? 
 You boys are going to your Aunt Lucy's - sleepover, it'll be fun. 
 What's he talking about? 
 I've no idea. You're not going to Lucy's. 
 I've arranged it. We've got work to do. 
 We'll drop you there now. How was court? 
 You bribed your sister?! 
 I did not! 
 I lent her money, she made a statement - separate things! 
 Can you not see how that could get put together? 
 I make mistakes. 
 But I didn't kill a child! They were gonna shut the case down. 
 She knew something, but needed money. I did not know it was Joe! 
 That's all right, then (!) 
 It's gonna be all right, they've got enough evidence, haven't they? 
 It could go either way. Juries are funny animals. 
 Would it kill you to be reassuring? You are terrible company! 
 Why are we going back here, anyway? 
 Tess has found Gary Thorp. I really wanna talk to him. 
 Gary Thorp? 
 South Mercia Police. 
 Are you the same Gary Thorp who owns Thorp Agri Services? 
 Used to. It was my dad's business. When he died, I took it over. 
 Went bankrupt. What's this about? 
 Did Kate Gillespie do your business accounts? 
 Not to my knowledge. 
 Have you ever met Kate, or her husband, Ricky? 
 Once. He met lent me cash when I was in trouble. 
 Money came from his niece, Lisa. 
 So you know Lisa Newbury? 
 We went out a couple of times. 
 Was it serious? 
 I wish! 
 Uh... 
 I fell for her, big time. 
 I thought she was the one, and she didn't feel the same about me. 
 Why didn't you come forward when Lisa disappeared? 
 I wasn't in any state. 
 Why not? 
 The business was in a state cos I wasn't paying to attention to it and my life went out of control. 
 What do you mean? 
 I used to follow her a little bit. 
 Stand outside where she was. I'm not proud of it. 
 Like when she was babysitting? 
 Did you stand outside the Gillespies' house when she was there? 
 Where were you on the night the girls disappeared? 
 In hospital. 
 I tried to kill myself. 
 So what are you here for? 
 Did you ever give money to Gary Thorp? 
 Never heard of him. 
 He went out with Lisa, got a business called Thorp Agri Services. 
 Yes... Yeah, I did give him some cash. 
 Lisa asked for some help, said he had a cash flow problem, that I'd get it back. 
 Why didn't you tell us at the time? 
 Uh, cos it didn't seem important and it never came up. 
 Did you knew he ran an animal incineration business? 
 Jesus. Do you think he had something to do with it? 
 How long have you had this picture? 
 A year, two. 
 You like bluebells? 
 (CHUCKLES) Uh... 
 Yeah, yeah. They're all right. They're a... 
 They're a flower, aren't they? So... 
 Well, thank you very much for your time. 
 Yeah. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 You still got the number you found in Claire's phone? 
 Yeah. 
 Ring it. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 (RINGS) 
 (RINGING CONTINUES) 
 (RINGING STOPS) 
 No-one followed you, did they? They don't know I'm here. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 When were you gonna tell me?! 
 (GASPS) 
 I don't know... 
 You don't know?! 
 I swear! 
 I don't know... Get off me. Get off me! 
 You were pregnant! 
 Get off me. 
 Get off me! 
 I wasn't ready to tell you, and then you were arrested. 
 I didn't know what was gonna happen. 
 I was so scared! 
 I was so scared. 
 What happened to the baby? 
 I had an abo... 
 I had an abortion. 
 (SOBS) 
 How did Alec Hardy know about this? 
 Alec? Alec? He told you? 
 How did he know? 
 He came to the clinic with me. 
 He stayed with me. 
 Was the baby mine? 
 Was the baby mine?! 
 You have to ask me that? 
 You have to ask me that, after all I've done for you? 
 (YELLS INDISTINCTLY) 
 (YELLS) 
 I don't want you near me. 
 I need three doubters on the jury - who am I aiming for? 
 No 0.6 did not like Hardy - she kept shaking her head without realising. 
 This bloke kept fidgeting every time Jocelyn was on her feet, like he wasn't interested. That one laughed at your jokes. 
 This one's very pro you - sits up and smiles every time you speak. 
 Quite right. 
 This one is not impressed with the police evidence. 
 A lot of work to get her onside. 
 I don't care about them. 
 As long as we've got three, they can't get a unanimous verdict, or a majority. 
 How did you know to look at their joint bank statements? 
 Oh, right. Erm... You know the boy who works at the local newspaper? 
 Mm. 
 Ellie Miller's nephew. 
 Possibly shagged him. 
 No! 
 Bloody hell! (LAUGHS) 
 I hope you gave him a good time! (LAUGHS) 
 Jocelyn, I'm sorry about your mum. 
 We're working now, Ben. 
 All the same... 
 Compartments - that's how we survive in this world. 
 What do we know about the defendant? 
 We know he had a violent temper. 
 We know he was in secret communication with Danny. 
 We know he was secretly meeting Danny. 
 We know the defendant has not been able to give us a satisfactory explanation as to why he had Danny's phone. 
 Or why he gave Danny £500 in cash. 
 We know forensics have placed him at the murder scene. 
 You've heard sworn evidence that Joe Miller was seen dumping clothes that night. 
 You have not heard any alibi evidence to place him anywhere else other than at the murder scene. 
 And yet the one person we haven't heard from is the defendant himself. 
 It's a short walk from the dock to the witness box - 
 I've counted it to be 13 steps. 
 You may think that if you're falsely accused of a child's murder, you'd make that short walk. 
 You may even think you'd run there to reassure the jury of your innocence. 
 But when given the opportunity to give his own account and explanation of the evidence against him, when given a chance to protest his innocence, to shout it from the rooftops... he chooses to stay silent. 
 Instead, he allows his lawyers to speculate, to throw red herrings around to try and distract you from the truth. 
 You may conclude that the reason for all these distortions, and the reason the defendant has not got into that witness box is because he knows, he knows he can't defend himself. 
 He's preferred to hide behind the glass, to hide behind the fabricated stories his lawyers are fighting to convince you of. 
 In a moment, you're going to hear from Ms Bishop, who's going to make many ludicrous suggestions. 
 It's up to you, members of the jury, how seriously you take these. 
 But the Crown's case is that you can be sure of the defendant's guilt. 
 You can be sure Joe Miller... murdered Daniel Latimer. 
 I always loved watching your speeches. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck with yours. 
 My boy can't appeal his sentence. 
 So... you and your shitty justice system... can both go to hell. 
 The Crown needs you to be sure. 
 They've given you a version of events, but there's a compelling alternative version of what happened that night. 
 It's not in any dispute that Danny's father, Mark, was 50 yards away from the murder scene. 
 Let's stop and think about that. 
 Mark Latimer had just engaged in illicit s*x with a new-found mistress that had a profound effect on him. 
 Because, according to his own evidence, he composed a letter to his wife telling her the marriage was over, that he had found his new soul-mate. 
 He interpreted a fumble in a car as true love. 
 Now let's remember that there was a window in the hut where Danny was, which had a direct view onto the carpark. 
 Let's say that Danny saw his dad with his new mistress. 
 Let's say that he ran from the hut and confronted his dad. 
 As soon as his face popped up at that car window, Mark's dream, Mark's absurd schoolboy fantasy was in pieces. 
 He was jolted back to the real world. 
 Just picture it. 
 Danny's gonna run to his mum, tell her everything. 
 Mark has a tiny window of opportunity to stop him, to explain, to reassure and persuade him not to tell. 
 Now let's imagine Danny tried to break free, ran back to the hut. 
 Mark follows him. 
 There's an altercation. 
 And in the ensuing tragedy and confusion, Mark ends up killing Danny. 
 Can you be sure that didn't happen? 
 You also heard evidence that Nigel Carter was seen dumping Danny's body that night. 
 Can you be sure that Mark did not kill Danny and call his workmate and best friend to help him out of a crisis? 
 You may also feel that the police investigation was fundamentally flawed. 
 Procedures compromised, personal liaisons got in the way of the truth. 
 Now it is an undoubted tragedy that a young boy was murdered. 
 But it's my job to represent the defendant. 
 And it's my contention that it's impossible to be sure that this man is guilty. 
 There's only one candidate on trial here - the defendant. 
 The prosecution have to prove their case against this defendant. 
 You have to be satisfied that you are sure of the defendant's guilt. 
 The defence, as part of their case, have offered you an alternative. 
 If you think what the defence says is true, or may possibly be true, then the prosecution have failed in proving the guilt of the defendant. 
 There's no burden on the defence to prove anything. 
 There's no obligation on the defendant to give evidence. 
 Now, you may draw your own conclusions as to why the defendant has chosen not to give evidence, but bear in mind he will have obtained legal advice on the matter. 
 You are the judges of fact. 
 You must put aside any emotion and approach this in a cold, analytical way. 
 Consider and assess all of the evidence that you've heard The first thing you need to do is appoint a foreperson. 
 And if you need to be reminded of any evidence, just pass a note via the jury bailiff. 
 You will now be escorted to a private room to begin your deliberations. Thank you. 
 
 
 
 How are you doing? 
 You have to rise above it, Dad. 
 The judge has let the jury go today. They'll be reconvening tomorrow. 
 How long will it take? 
 It could be done within an hour tomorrow, could be a week, it's impossible to predict. 
 Do we have to come in tomorrow if they're still discussing? 
 No, but if they reach a verdict, they'll read it immediately. 
 We have to sit and wait? 
 Yeah. 
 Whole system stinks. 
 I know it can't have been easy for you in there. 
 You have no idea. 
 Tell me they're going to come back with the right verdict. 
 I hope so. 
 I don't know what I've done to deserve this. 
 It's a thank you for pulling me back into the world. 
 Have I done that? 
 You know you have. 
 There's something else. 
 Something I should have told you... long before now. 
 There was a moment, must have been 15 years ago. 
 I should have said it then, and I didn't. 
 And I want to say it now. 
 It's always been you. 
 What has? 
 You're gonna make me say it, aren't you? 
 Fine. 
 I'm in love with you, Maggie. 
 Ever since you came here. 
 What am I supposed to do with that now? 
 Do you really think I didn't know? 
 Well, why didn't you say anything? 
 Because you never did! 
 I thought if you really feel that strongly, you'd be brave, you wouldn't care what people thought. 
 But your work mattered more. 
 I thought it did. 
 But I was wrong. 
 Say something. 
 Jocelyn, you're grieving, you're feeling alone, that's why you're saying this. 
 (SIGHS) 
 But it's over. The moment passed. 
 No. 
 I don't think it has. 
 Are you OK? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Just... got into a bit of a scrap. 
 You should see the other girl. 
 Have you reported this to the police? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 What's so funny about that? 
 I think I need a bit of sanctuary. 
 I've got some antiseptic wipes - I can have a look at the eye for you. 
 Thank you. 
 It was my husband - he found out I'd had an abortion. 
 Has he been violent with you before? 
 Not really. 
 Do you live locally? 
 Don't really live anywhere at the moment. 
 I can recommend a women's refuge for you. 
 I can drive you there, if need be. 
 No, it's not like that. 
 It looks very much like that. 
 No, it's not. 
 It really is not. It's more complicated. 
 And I'm... 
 I'm all out of places to run, that's the problem. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 I was in trouble once. I was living rough. 
 I'd sort of... 
 .. hit rock bottom. 
 What did you do? 
 I stopped, turned around and faced the demons I'd been avoiding. 
 There was no other way to go, so I fought back. 
 'When I am weak, then I am strong.' 
 Recurring suspects - what were they doing in the 12 hours before Lisa and Pippa went missing? 
 Uh... Right. 
 Claire... left work at four o'clock and she went to do Kate's hair... 
 It's there. 
 Oh. 
 .. for the wedding party that night. 
 Ricky - he got home at 4:45, having spent the afternoon at a building site doing foundations. 
 Lee finished a job that morning putting in flooring in a church hall then went to buy stock - we've got him on CCTV in the carpark, a receipt timed at 14:27, so that tallies. 
 Claire and Kate remember hearing him working on his own floor when Claire was doing Kate's hair. 
 When was that taken? 
 About a week before. 
 That leaves Gary Thorp, who says he spent all day and most of the evening at work - the place was on a 7 day, 24 hour activity during that period. 
 The furnace was alight all weekend? Who else knew? 
 What bothers me is when I asked about Thorp Agri Services, he lied. 
 He said maybe it was connected to Kate. 
 He'd heard that name before, knew it was connected. How? 
 Gary Thorp is a credible suspect if he was stalking Lisa. 
 How does Lee Ashworth know that? We only know cos Thorp told us. 
 Ashworth would have no reason to know. 
 Unless Lisa told him. 
 Exactly. 
 Miller, there it is - that's the lie. That's the wee lie. 
 He wanted me to think he'd heard about Thorp through Kate, but what if it was through Lisa? 
 If that's the case, Lee must have known her better that he's admitted. 
 Mustn't he! 
 What did that text mean? 
 I've got something wrong? 
 Thought you'd come round. 
 Spoken to Claire yet? 
 What do you want? 
 Did you ever sleep with Lisa Newbury? 
 No. 
 Did you want to? 
 No. 
 She turn you down? 
 No. 
 What did Claire make of you and Lisa? 
 There was no 'me and Lisa'. 
 I barely even spoke to her. 
 Right. 
 Just slept with her? 
 What's it like to kill someone, Lee? 
 What's it like to be in the room when the life goes out a person? 
 How does it feel to be responsible for that? 
 I told you, I don't know. 
 I think you do. 
 I look at you and I see someone stained by death. 
 I think it haunts you every single day. 
 Just confess, Lee. 
 I'm nearly there, anyway. 
 I've got nothing else to say. 
 Between you and Claire, I think there's plenty still to say. 
 I'm gonna make you say it. 
 There's a question from the jury. We're going back in. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 The jury have asked to see a photograph of the view from the window of the clifftop hut. 
 We will get copies to you straight away. 
 And the second question is to clarify... to clarify whether Mark Latimer was ever questioned by the police as a suspect. 
 Erm... Yes, he was. 
 He was arrested for obstruction and spoken to in connection with Danny's death. 
 If they're asking those questions... 
 Doesn't necessarily mean anything. 
 Of course it does. They're going with the defence. 
 They're in there saying I might be the killer. 
 What are you doing?! 
 Mocking up two different versions - 
 Not now. Not now! 
 All right, Mags? 
 Hi, Nige. 
 Any news? 
 No, nothing yet. 
 (DOOR BURSTS OPEN) 
 Ooh! 
 Got anything juicy coming up next? 
 Er... Armed robberies, Bristol. 
 Nice! 
 You? 
 Sexual assault, Southwark. 
 Oh. 
 So, what do you think - the verdict? 
 I think it could do either way. What do you reckon? 
 We've won. 
 Ha! 
 Seriously, I mean, Jocelyn, she's great, but she's past it. 
 Abby. 
 I wanted to say... 
 Mm? 
 I think you're a truly... horrible person. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 The jury are coming back in. 
 Madam Foreperson, please answer my first question 'yes' or 'no'. 
 Have you reached a verdict on this defendant upon which you are all agreed? 
 No. 
 I can't do this. 
 I would urge you to continue trying to reach a unanimous verdict. 
 But I am prepared to accept a verdict upon which at least ten of you are agreed. 
 Would you please now go with the jury bailiff. Thank you. 
 I keep thinking about that last Sunday we were all together. 
 Before you went to Florida. 
 You came to ours for a barbecue and the boys all went out playing football till it got dark. 
 Way after it got dark. 
 Tom came into your kitchen to get torches so they could keep playing. 
 I can still see them all now. 
 I shut my eyes - the sun's setting, I can see them all playing. 
 Danny, Mark, Tom... and Nige and... 
 Joe. 
 Even the memories are spoiled. 
 There's this moment where Dan spotted me looking out. 
 And he ran over in his yellow shirt. 
 He ran to the window, all pink and sweaty from running round. 
 He pulled a face at the window, it made me laugh. 
 I pulled one back. 
 My little boy pulling faces at me. 
 I'm thinking of leaving Mark. It's not working. 
 Even when this is over, it won't fix us. 
 We're not the same people anymore. 
 Be careful, though, Beth. 
 You think you're alone in that marriage, you're not. 
 It's nothing compared to being really alone. 
 It's over, isn't it, between us? 
 I think it might be. 
 How does it work, though, us without each other? 
 Do you trust me to keep your secrets? 
 As much as you trust me to keep yours. 
 What will you do? 
 Go back to France, I suppose. 
 What's so great about France? 
 Nobody knows me. 
 Almost nobody. 
 You shouldn't have hit me. 
 You're lucky I stopped there. 
 What did you say? 
 It's a joke. 
 Thank God you never became a father. 
 Where will you go? 
 You're so stupid. 
 Have you played that yet? 
 Thank you. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You want the bloody pendant? Have it. 
 No. You took this?! 
 You had this all along?! 
 There's a verdict. Jury are coming back in. 
 No, no, no. You're not leaving my sight. Come on! 
 Could we have the jury back in, please. 
 What do you think? 
 Shh! 
 Madam Foreperson, please answer my first question 'yes' or 'no'. 
 Have you reached a verdict on this defendant? 
 Yes. 
 Is this the verdict of you all, or as a majority? 
 A majority. 
 Would the defendant please stand. 
 Do you find the defendant Joseph Michael Miller guilty, or not guilty?
