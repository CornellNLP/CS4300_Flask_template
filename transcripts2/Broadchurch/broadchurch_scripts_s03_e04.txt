 MILLER: Previously on Broadchurch HARDY: Trish Winterman received an anonymous threatening text message from a blocked number. 
  Trish, could the text be from the man that you slept with the morning you were attacked? 
  I told you, I'm not talking about him. 
  We're probably going to retrieve his DNA from your bed sheets, anyway. 
  She's dealing with a trauma. 
  You're pushing too hard. 
  You have to dial it back. 
  11 grand for our little boy's life? 
  I don't want compensation, I want justice. 
  We don't want it. 
  We're telling you. 
  You don't seem to hear us. 
  To process a civil suit you need to know Mr. 
  Miller's whereabouts. 
  - We'd need an address for him. 
  - There it is then, we can't. 
  No-one knows where he is any more. 
  That stuff you did to the laptop I gave you. 
  Can you delete it? 
  Get me the computer, I'll get it removed. 
  CATH: You have to remember, Trish. 
  You have to do everything you can to help them catch him. 
  We're all in danger if you don't. 
  (BIRDSONG) 
  MILLER: Are you sure about this, Trish? 
  BETH: You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. 
  I'm sure. 
  I want to help. 
  I want to remember. 
  So I got dropped off back there. 
  I walked in this way. 
  Can I? 
  Wherever you want. 
  We'll be led by you. 
  (MUSIC PLAYS) 
  - Did she tell you about the flowers? 
  - No. 
  What flowers? 
  Someone left her a bunch of flowers, with a card saying, "Thinking of you." Unsigned. 
  - Who does the think they're from? 
  - She doesn't know. 
  - When was this? 
  - Last night. 
  - Has she still got the card? 
  - Yeah. 
  She showed it to me when I picked her up. 
  OK. 
  Thanks, Beth. 
  So the the party was in the main room down here. 
  But The kitchens, they're through there, aren't they? 
  Did you go into the kitchen, at all? 
  Yeah, I did. 
  For a moment. 
  I'd forgotten. 
  Yeah, later in the evening, I brought some plates back. 
  I was trying to be helpful. 
  There weren't many staff on. 
  I just had a quick word with the guys working here. 
  Oi! Do you mind? 
  We're trying to work here. 
  I should have mentioned it before. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Not at all. 
  That's why this is worth doing. 
  Anything that jogs your memory or helps you remember. 
  - How are you doing? 
  - Yeah. 
  Fine. 
  Really? 
  You wanna stop? 
  Will Will you stay close to me? 
  Yeah. 
  ( JAMES: Laid ) 
  Thank you. 
  Moved out of the house so you moved next door I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall I found you sleeping  
  (MOUTHS) 
  (SQUEALS) 
  (BOTH SQUEAL AND LAUGH) 
  I was so happy that night. 
  ( KULA SHAKER: Hush ) 
  Hush, hush, I thought I heard you calling my name now Hush, hush, you broke my heart but that was a dream now Hush, hush, I thought I heard you calling my name now Hush, hush, you broke my heart but that was a dream now Early in the morning, late in the evening Ed was the last bloke I walked past. 
  We should go outside now. 
  Go ahead. 
  We'll follow. 
  The owner's here today, right? 
  Yeah, he said he'd stay upstairs, out of the way. 
  Did you notice a wheelbarrow in the corridor when we first looked round this place? 
  - No. 
  - Nah, me neither. 
  Right, so I smoked here. 
  And Ian Are you trying to humiliate me? 
  You made your choice, arsehole. 
  What are you thinking of, bringing that slag here tonight? 
  Which way did he go when the argument finished? 
  I dunno, I'd turned my back on him. 
  And then, after a few minutes, I heard my name being called. 
  I think. 
  And I walked towards the voice. 
  But you didn't recognise who it was? 
  Well, I sort of assumed it was Ian. 
  You didn't hear the person behind you before you were hit? 
  No. 
  No. 
  Only at the last minute. 
  Icould almost feel the air moving. 
  How far did he carry me? 
  I don't know how close it is. 
  (BIRDS CHIRP, RUNNING WATER) 
  (RUNNING WATER) 
  Are you OK? 
  That's the sound. 
  Trish, you don't have to put yourself through this. 
  Will you hold my hand, Beth? 
  Of course. 
  Yeah. 
  (WATER RUNNING OVER ROCKS) 
  - Trish? 
  - No, no, let me do this. 
  I need to. 
  (STIFLES SOBS) 
  (SHUDDERS) 
  (STIFLED CRY) 
  (WAILS) 
  (CRY DISTORTS) 
  (COUGHS AND RETCHES) 
  (GROANS) 
  I can smell it. 
  Trish, let's get you away from here. 
  No. 
  No, it's It's the smell. 
  It's the water and leaves and But something else. 
  Erm Vodka? 
  Something like that. 
  He'd been drinking. 
  I I could smell it on him and And there was a light shining, from over there. 
  - What sort of a light? 
  - I dunno. 
  Really bright. 
  Do you think it came from that cottage? 
  - It was that direction, yeah. 
  - How bright was it? 
  I dunno, cos he put his arm over me, I Any clearer about the type of light, Trish? 
  Or when it came on? 
  Can I go? 
  I want to go. 
  I want to go now. 
  - Of course you can. 
  - I'll take you back, Trish. 
  (SOBS) 
  - I could barely handle that. 
  - Yeah. 
  What was that light, Miller? 
  Yeah, there's a security light. 
  It could have been that. 
  Often on a motion sensor. 
  What would have tripped it? 
  Unless it was turned on from the inside. 
  - Which means someone was in. 
  - Can we not get access? 
  We've not heard back yet from the man who lives here. 
  Katie's chasing it up. 
  I suppose it could have been headlights from a vehicle. 
  Yeah, maybe. 
  Is that the right angle? 
  Unless it was closer than she thinks. 
  Torchlight maybe, shining down on her. 
  - Or a phone. 
  - Yeah, that's possible. 
  Where's the owner? 
  My wife took it upon herself, after your chaps had gone, to have a clear-up. 
  Mostly stuff the grandchildren leave lying around. 
  So this was found in your grounds since our crime scene people left? 
  Yes. 
  I think it's my wife's way of retaking ownership after what happened. 
  We've both been rather affected by it. 
  And you didn't think to tell us you'd found this stuff? 
  No. 
  Er, no. 
  Sorry. 
  - Is it relevant? 
  - We're still looking for the weapon used to knock the woman unconscious. 
  - Oh, I see. 
  - Get me an exhibit bag. 
  This bat needs to go to the lab for testing. 
  - (MOBILE RINGS) 
  - It's one of a pair, actually. 
  I've got no idea where the other's got to. 
  Katie, how are you doing? 
  I've been working through the sex-offenders register. 
  There's a convicted rapist who moved back into the area ten weeks ago, been released from prison. 
  Any more detail than that? 
  Yeah. 
  I've just been reading his file. 
  Ellie his victim was tied and gagged, just like Trish. 
  OK. 
  Send me his address. 
  We'll go there now. 
  So the cricket bat is in for testing, but there's still an identical one missing. 
  We still haven't got whatever the attacker used to gag Trish. 
  And we now need to work out what the light was that Trish saw during the attack. 
  What else did Harford have? 
  Trish's phone provider got back to her. 
  That anonymous text message was sent via a website, which requires anyone sending a message to log in first and they log all the IP addresses of any person posting a message. 
  So they should get back with details to Katie first thing. 
  OK. 
  Good. 
  Aaron Mayford, 31, IT consultant. 
  Three years for the rape of a woman at a budget hotel. 
  The victim was tied to the bed and gagged. 
  (GROANS) 
  He pleaded not guilty at the trial, forced the victim to give evidence. 
  How long was he inside? 
  Er 16 months. 
  Released on parole. 
  Well, he sounds like a delight. 
  (SARCASTICALLY) 
  Can't wait to meet him. 
  Hi. 
  DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police. 
  Looking for Aaron. 
  Can't leave him alone, can you? 
  Yeah, I read the report, wondered if you'd pitch up here. 
  You're on the register. 
  We'd be remiss not to rule you out. 
  A woman in her 50s, weren't it? 
  Did you not even look at the details of my case? 
  Fussy about age, are you? 
  You don't need to hear this. 
  All right. 
  I've served my sentence. 
  I'm entitled to a fresh start. 
  No. 
  You're out on parole. 
  You're still doing your time. 
  What about the woman you raped, Aaron? 
  Did she get a fresh start? 
  If you're interested in the truth, the girl was as pissed as I was. 
  Girl? 
  How old was she? 
  - 27. 
  - Woman, then. 
  The woman and I met at a conference. 
  We had a drink, she came back to my room. 
  We had s*x. 
  It was a laugh. 
  When she woke up, she freaked. 
  She told me she had a husband. 
  That's when she started accusing me of things. 
  Like tying her up? 
  I did tie her up. 
  Yeah. 
  I like to play. 
  So what? 
  There's nothing abnormal about it. 
  Everyone's reading Fifty Shades Of Grey on the bus. 
  I'm not a rapist. 
  Well, according to a jury, you are. 
  Juries get things wrong, don't they? 
  What is it you do now, Aaron? 
  Data entry. 
  The company send me boxes of files. 
  I input the data. 
  They set me up with it for my release. 
  - You work from home? 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  Not many offices would want me in there now, would they? 
  No. 
  Where were you last Saturday night? 
  Fishing. 
  I do that every Saturday now. 
  I go down to the beach, set up, all night. 
  Me and my dad used to do it, when we were on holiday when I was a kid. 
  It reminds me of him. 
  - You get the world to yourself. 
  - Which beach? 
  A couple of miles east of town. 
  Around Flintcombe? 
  No, not that far. 
  About halfway between there and Broadchurch. 
  - How did you get there? 
  - Drove. 
  Where did you park? 
  A National Trust car park just off the beach. 
  What time did you leave home? 
  - About ten, eleven. 
  - What time did you get back? 
  Half-six, seven, in the morning. 
  Was your wife up when you got back? 
  She'll remember me getting in. 
  Anyone see you on the beach? 
  There were a couple of blokes fishing down the beach. 
  I passed them on my way to set up. 
  Can I see your fishing equipment? 
  Welcome to the man cave. 
  I try and work out, you know. 
  An hour or two a day, keeps my head clear. 
  - Do you work out? 
  - No. 
  (CLATTER) 
  Fishing gear. 
  As used on Saturday night. 
  What bait do you use? 
  It's mackerel, so hooks and plastic. 
  You catch anything? 
  I did all right, yeah. 
  Quite the gallery you've got. 
  Mm. 
  Keeps me motivated. 
  He certainly lived down to expectations. 
  Have Harford check the CCTV on all routes between here and the beach on Saturday night. 
  I want to know everything about that man. 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  Hi, Dad. 
  Hi, love. 
  How's it going? 
  Ah, you know, the same. 
  And how's Mum doing? 
  Not good. 
  She's in bed. 
  She went back to Axehampton today, with the police, to see if she could remember anything. 
  Right. 
  Blimey. 
  And did she? 
  Did she say that it helped? 
  She remember anything? 
  Hm, not sure. 
  She was a mess when she came back, really upset. 
  Well, yeah, I guess she would be. 
  And how about you, love? 
  How are you holding up? 
  I'm OK. 
  I miss you, Dad. 
  I miss you too, Leah. 
  Listen, I was wondering, erm if I popped over, maybe in the next half hour, would that be all right? 
  I just need to borrow the old laptop. 
  What for? 
  Oh, it's got some files on it I need for school. 
  I'll get it back to you later tonight. 
  So, is that OK? 
  I I don't know. 
  Well, Mum won't mind. 
  I don't want to ask her. 
  I'd have to wake her. 
  Yeah. 
  No, no. 
  No, no, no. 
  You don't need to bother her. 
  Listen, it will be two hours, maximum. 
  It's Mum's computer. 
  You should ask her. 
  Maybe tomorrow. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, right, if that's I'm sure you're right. 
  Of course you are. 
  Good. 
  That's a plan, then. 
  And, listen, honestly, don't bother Mum with this. 
  Er I'll I'll catch up with her direct. 
  OK? 
  And I'll see you later in the week. 
  Yeah? 
  Yeah. 
  Love you lots, darling. 
  Love you, too. 
  sh1t. 
  sh1t. 
  sh1t. 
  sh1t. 
  sh1t. 
  sh1t. 
  Hopefully, Cath can back up Trish's memories of the party. 
  Did you get a good night's sleep? 
  No. 
  You? 
  I dreamt I was at Axehampton, lying next to the waterfall. 
  Right. 
  You should probably go home an hour early tonight. 
  Wow. 
  Was that you doing supportive boss? 
  Yeah. 
  - No good? 
  - Awful. 
  The whole town's getting jittery. 
  We're not gonna let this b*st*rd dictate how we live our lives. 
  So, me and Ed from work thought, you know, a football match on the beach. 
  Put a smile back on everyone's faces. 
  I've rung around everyone I know, told them to pass on the word and we'll just pick teams from whoever pitches up. 
  Do some sort of knockout competition. 
  You should come. 
  Bring your partners, kids, whoever. 
  - Are people coming? 
  - Yeah. 
  We can still have a bit of fun, can't we? 
  Otherwise, he wins. 
  Whoever he is. 
  And we're not having that. 
  Oh, I've asked Leah to come, too, as well, just in case Anyway, sorry, go on, ask what you need to ask. 
  Erm What time did you arrive at Axehampton house, the night of your party? 
  Erm Just after six. 
  Jim said he'd been there most of the afternoon. 
  And what time did people start arriving? 
  Half-past seven, which was annoying, actually. 
  It said eight. 
  Who turns up early to a thing like that? 
  It's not like it's at someone's house. 
  And where were you when people arrived? 
  I was in the main bit, you know, the library bit, where the band were playing later. 
  Could you show us on the diagram? 
  Yeah. 
  Erm So we were all in here. 
  Erm, people were coming in and out of that door there and the food was being done there. 
  You knew everyone on the invite list? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  More or less. 
  There were a few of Jim's business associates, you know, suppliers and stuff, who I'd maybe met just the once. 
  Did you witness the fight between Jim and Ed Burnett? 
  No. 
  No, I didn't. 
  I was in the kitchen. 
  Somebody came running through to get me. 
  But by the time I got there, it was over and Ed had gone. 
  When did you start working for Ed Burnett? 
  Er Four years ago. 
  They've been bickering about it ever since. 
  Jim hates me working there. 
  I wouldn't have to if his bloody garage was doing better. 
  Could you take us through your movements during the night? 
  Yeah. 
  Erm I didn't really move much from that room. 
  Erm, I'd had quite a bit to drink. 
  Champagne, mostly. 
  I think the waiters were instructed to keep my glass filled up, so I was just at the door, you know, watching people come in, taking presents. 
  Did you see much of Trish Winterman that evening? 
  Yeah. 
  I spent quite a bit of time with her at the beginning. 
  Then she went off with some of the other girls from work. 
  Were you aware of her having any problems with anyone? 
  There was a bit of a row between her and Ian, her ex. 
  But that was to be expected. 
  He brought his bloody girlfriend. 
  And I told him not to, but he did, anyway. 
  So Trish wasn't wild about that. 
  Did Did Trish and Sarah talk? 
  No. 
  No, no. 
  Trish gave her a wide berth. 
  I was civil. 
  That was it. 
  I saw Sarah and Ian having a barney a bit later on, actually, and then she left shortly after that, luckily. 
  Did she talk to anyone else? 
  Ed. 
  Obviously. 
  Or rather Ed talked to her. 
  Ed would spend all night with Trish, if he could. 
  She came over to me about nine to be rescued. 
  He's not a naturally sociable person, Ed. 
  He just sticks to one or two people and I think she'd had enough. 
  Martin Skittles from the pub. 
  A few others. 
  Jim, obviously. 
  Erm Could you describe your marriage to us, Cath? 
  That's relevant, is it? 
  Well, I don't know. 
  That's why I'm asking. 
  I'd describe it as "loveless". 
  That do? 
  Could you expand on that a little? 
  No, I think that pretty much sums it up. 
  Can you tell us anything else about the party? 
  Yeah. 
  I didn't think anything of it at the time. 
  I wasn't gonna mention it, but I don't know where Jim was at the end of the evening. 
  When you say, "end of the evening"? 
  Well, from half 11 on, till about half-past one. 
  Couldn't find him anywhere. 
  Erm He wasn't in the main bit and he wasn't in the grounds nearby. 
  So where do you think he was? 
  Well, I don't know. 
  That's what I'm saying. 
  You'd have to ask him. 
  Beth! Ed Burnett. 
  - The farm-shop bloke. 
  - Yeah, I remember you. 
  Were you waiting for me to come out? 
  Sort of. 
  Look, I know you're helping Trish. 
  Cath Atwood told me. 
  I can't talk to you about that. 
  I just want to know, is she doing OK? 
  Right, just so we're clear. 
  Everything between me and Trish is confidential. 
  I'm her boss. 
  She's worked for me for years. 
  - I'm worried for her, that's all. 
  - I can't discuss her with you. 
  Then can you pass on a message? 
  Tell her I'm thinking about her. 
  We all are. 
  And anything she needs, anything at all, I'm absolutely there for her. 
  It's not appropriate for me to do that. 
  Right. 
  Oh, OK. 
  (SIGHS) 
  - Can't you ask Cath Atwood? 
  - I have. 
  You know, belt and braces. 
  I've got to go. 
  Sure. 
  Sorry for holding you up. 
  Are you coming to the beach later for the football? 
  Yeah. 
  Mr. 
  Latimer? 
  Nick Foulkes. 
  We spoke on the phone. 
  - Yeah. 
  Do you want a coffee? 
  - No, I really can't stop. 
  I just thought, I was driving past, better to let you have it in person, than the vagaries of the post. 
  I can remember when our postal system was the envy of the world. 
  Now? 
  One delivery a day. 
  - If we're lucky! - What did you find out? 
  I got everything you asked for. 
  Everything? 
  Didn't take long. 
  Not to let light in upon the magic, but it really wasn't that difficult. 
  - My invoice is in there also. 
  - Right. 
  Thanks. 
  I've given you a 50% discount. 
  In light of your circumstances. 
  What do you mean? 
  I'm truly sorry for your loss. 
  Oi, oi! Hey. 
  I thought it was you. 
  - You all right? 
  - Did you hear about this match? 
  I did. 
  - Let's go get it! Get it!  
  - Come on!  
  (OVERLAPPING SHOUTS) 
  Go on, Nige! Yeah!  
  (LAUGHTER) 
  - (WHISTLE) 
  - Get up! Here we go! To my feet! Come on, George! Come on, then. 
  Get off! - What's that? 
  - Bloody hell, Ed. 
  Prick. 
  (LAUGHTER) 
  Good on you, girl! Hiya!  
  - You all right? 
  - Yeah. 
  Hello, love. 
  Hello, darling, you all right? 
  - You want a cup of tea? 
  - Yeah. 
  Well, keep going! It's only Trish. 
  Bloody hell. 
  Come on. 
  (SHOUTING) 
  (LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING) 
  Michael seems all right now. 
  He's put that school thing behind him. 
  Sorry, what school thing? 
  Him and another boy were suspended. 
  Watching pornography. 
  Sorry, I I thought you knew. 
  - Clive didn't tell me. 
  - Right. 
  Right. 
  Listen, I'm I'm so sorry. 
  I'm worried I'm losing him, Paul. 
  - Your husband? 
  - My boy. 
  We were always so close. 
  He'd tell me anything. 
  He was a proper homeboy. 
  Then he hits 14 and it all changes. 
  Michael needs a dad now. 
  It's a different sort of love. 
  I'm scared Clive's not up to it. 
  How can you be a good parent when you're still a child yourself? 
  Dad, pass the ball. 
  - OK. 
  I'll get these. 
  - See? 
  I told you this was a good idea. 
  I'm really proud of you, mate. 
  I think I'm ready to go home now. 
  - You did well being here. 
  - Thanks. 
  - Mind if I take this? 
  - This your company's handiwork? 
  Yep. 
  I'll get you a discount, if you like. 
  Come on, Leo, get your arse into gear. 
  All right? 
  - Hi. 
  You two know each other? 
  - Yeah, I used to teach him. 
 
 
 
  That was a bit awkward, Trish making an appearance. 
  Did you talk to her? 
  No. 
  It didn't feel the moment. 
  A bit public. 
  She's still Let me get this out of your way. 
  Come on, Leo. 
  Get your end up. 
  Blue twine on the goals? 
  Yeah. 
  We need to check that boy's alibi. 
  I've just received urgent oral authority from the Superintendent for surveillance on our friend Aaron Mayford. 
  You and Steve, get to his house till surveillance is organised. 
  I'm having Anna get all the background information on him. 
  Any particular reason for this? 
  Er I don't like him, and we rattled his cage earlier, so I want to know what he does and where he goes. 
  All right. 
  I'll let you know. 
  Right. 
  Er I'm away, Miller. 
  You should be, too. 
  Take a moment off, have a breather. 
  You all right? 
  It's not like you, clocking off after only 12 hours. 
  Have you got something planned? 
  No, not at all. 
  Oh. 
  OK, well, have a nice night, doing whatever it is you're not doing. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
  Hi. 
  I'm Chloe Latimer. 
  Is your dad in? 
  No, sorry. 
  Good. 
  Cos it's you I want to see. 
  Me? 
  Yeah. 
  I tried to talk to you earlier, at the football, but there were too many people around. 
  I heard what happened. 
  I don't know what you're talking about. 
  You do. 
  I know you're new. 
  It's hard. 
  I thought maybe you'd need a friend. 
  I do a bit, yeah. 
  - Alec? 
  - Yes. 
  Hi. 
  Zoe? 
  Yep. 
  I, er I recognised you. 
  Oh, you're wearing a suit. 
  Er, I wasn't sure. 
  Is that wrong? 
  No. 
  No, no. 
  Top marks for effort. 
  Sit down, please. 
  - A menu there. 
  - Thank you. 
  A drink? 
  Do you want a drink?

  You know? 
  I thought maybe I don't know. 
  I ran it past Chlo and she thought it was worth a try. 
  You don't live here. 
  Well, just think of me as a guest chef for the night. 
  You're cooking? 
  Yeah, I'm doing the old fish and olives, my speciality. 
  I went to the market this morning, got a fresh bass. 
  Can I smell burning? 
  Yeah, I may have over-toasted the breadcrumbs a little bit, like an idiot. 
  But it's fine, I've opened a window. 
  You shouldn't just let yourself in and start cooking. 
  I know you've had a hard time at work and I've had my head up my arse. 
  I don't know, I just thought maybe we could just sit down. 
  No pressure, just mates. 
  We're still mates, aren't we? 
  When was the last time you cooked fish? 
  - It was your 28th. 
  - Oh, yeah! And you got me that dress. 
  Yeah, you looked beautiful in that dress. 
  And I got the measurements right.

  Come and talk to me while I cook. 
  - No agenda? 
  - No. 
  We're not talking about anything else. 
  No Joe Miller. 
  No. 
  I I promise. 
  Just about us.

  Did you just drain all that? 
  You know it's meant to last all night? 
  Oh, my God. 
  - Oh! - sh1t! - Miller? 
  - You scared me! - Watch where you're going. 
  - What are you doing out? 
  - I'm walking home! - Back from your cheeky date? 
  - No! - Oh, look at your face! - Shut up, Miller. 
  - Was she nice? 
  - I'm walking home. 
  - Did you kiss her? 
  Have you seen this? 
  It just came through. 
  The DNA results. 
  The swabs they took from Trish Winterman. 
  We've got a match with one of our men. 
  Who? 
  The DNA sample we took from you has come back as a match with the sample we took from Trish Winterman, after she made an allegation of rape. 
  Well, it's not a match. 
  You've got it wrong. 
  It's a positive match, Jim. 
  No. 
  It can't be. 
  How do you explain it, then? 
  It's a mistake. 
  So you didn't attack Trish Winterman on the night of Cath's party? 
  You think that I raped a woman at my own wife's birthday party? 
  - Did you? 
  - No. 
  I wouldn't. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  She's She's what? 
  Look, Jim, all we want is the truth. 
  And we will get to it. 
  If you didn't attack her, why would your DNA be part of her sample? 
  (SIGHS HEAVILY) 
  Er (EXHALES) 
  Saturday morning Erm The day of the party Trish and me We were in bed together. 
  On the morning of your wife's birthday? 
  She was at work. 
  Erm An early shift. 
  Right. 
  Is that the first time you and Trish have slept together? 
  Yeah. 
  It was just s*x. 
  Cos me and Cath Erm we we don't er  
  (SIGHS) 
  Look What I'm saying is, I didn't attack Trish. 
  Why would I? 
  If I wanted to have s*x with her, I could. 
  And I did. 
  Look, you cannot tell Cath. 
  I don't know what she'd do. 
  She's my best friend. 
  If she ever finds out, I  
  (SIGHS) 
  God, it was a mistake. 
  I've never felt so bad about anything, but I just I just wanted s*x. 
  It's not wrong to want that. 
  No. 
  Who are the flowers from, Trish? 
  I don't know. 
  They were left on the front doorstep. 
  There's a card. 
  Do you mind if we take it? 
  No. 
  - Bloody hell. 
  - What? 
  (CAR DOORS UNLOCKED) 
  Confirmation of the credit card used on that website to send the anonymous SMS message to Trish. 
  It belonged to her husband, Ian. 
  What? 
  Her husband is sending her abusive anonymous messages? 
  Yeah. 
  Fancy going to have a chat with him? 
  Now-ish? 
  Yes, I do. 
  Are you, er, registered with any websites that enable you to send anonymous text messages? 
  No. 
  We know you are, Mr. 
  Winterman. 
  Well, I'm telling you, I'm not. 
  I think I'd know. 
  So you didn't send any messages to Trish, one of which said, "Shut up! Shut up or else", a couple of days after she was attacked? 
  What? 
  Why would I do that? 
  I don't know, but we'll need to see your computer. 
  - And your phone. 
  - Why? 
  Because an account registered to you was used to send the messages. 
  Well, it's wrong. 
  - It wasn't me. 
  - We'll need your computer. 
  I think it'd be better if you just told us what the text was supposed to mean. 
  I didn't send any bloody text!  
  - Well, someone did. 
  - Yeah, that was possibly me. 
  Sarah, please say you didn't. 
  Who are you? 
  Sarah Elsey. 
  I work here with Ian. 
  I'm his girlfriend. 
  And you're now admitting to sending this text to his wife? 
  - Ex-wife. 
  - Not yet. 
  Yes, I did. 
  I was on your computer. 
  I used your card. 
  I didn't know. 
  When I sent it, I didn't know she'd been raped. 
  Paul! Hello, mate. 
  I've been looking everywhere for you. 
  When you say "everywhere", do you mean "the church"? 
  Well, yeah. 
  Yeah, they do sometimes allow me outside of the exclusion zone. 
  A vicar with a sense of humour? 
  You should advertise. 
  - What are you doing tomorrow? 
  - Er Are you genuinely asking for a list of my appointments? 
  No. 
  But do you think you could move them? 
  No. 
  Why would I do that? 
  I'm going on a trip. 
  I thought you should maybe come along too. 
  - A trip where? 
  - I've found Joe Miller. 
  Absolutely not. 
  It's time to put things right, Paul. 
  - We did that. 
  - No, we Yes, we did! Enough of this sh1t, Mark! Just leave it alone. 
  I can't do that, I'm afraid. 
  Then you're on your own. 
  Fine. 
  Yes, of course, I completely understand. 
  Yes, that certainly sounds like one of ours. 
  No. 
  OK.
