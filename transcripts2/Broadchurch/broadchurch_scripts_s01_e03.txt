 Previously on Broadchurch... 
 Look at your community from the outside. 
 I can't be outside it and don't want to be. 
 You can't be objective, you're not the right fit. 
 Anybody's capable of this, given the circumstances. 
 No killer behaves normally over time. 
 You know people here. 
 Look for the out of the ordinary. 
 He was in a boat. 
 Follow your instincts. 
 My instinct tells me the Latimers did not kill their son. 
 Where were you last night? 
 I told you, I was on a job. 
 There was no callout. 
 I met a mate. 
 What's your mate's name? 
 Can't remember. 
 Sorry? 
 Danny was killed here. We also found another set of prints by the sink. 
 They belong to Mark Latimer. 
 Hey, mate... 
 It's all right. 
 It's all right, I'm here. Come here. 
 Come here. 
 There we go, eh. 
 I'm so sorry, mate. 
 Am I too rustly? 
 What's that? 
 Well, it's freezing. 
 Long weekend working, big day ahead. 
 I thought a Thermos would help. 
 It makes no sense. 
 What? 
 The body found at the bottom of Harbour Cliff. Why move him there? 
 Why not throw him off here? It's a good cliff to chuck a body over. 
 Can you not talk about it like that, please? 
 Any boats gone missing recently? 
 A boat would leave no tracks. 
 You could moor it on the shore, leave a body, and the evidence would be washed away. 
 What time's Mark Latimer coming in? 
 Nine. 
 Sir, I can't believe he's done this. 
 Many reasons why his prints could be in that hut. 
 Look at the evidence in front of you. Stop behaving like you're his bloody solicitor. 
 Just on the loo. 
 You OK? 
 Fine. 
 Well.. 
 You can't say we're not being thought of. 
 Look at all this food. It just keeps on arriving. 
 What do we do with it all? 
 I'll take some. 
 There's some amazing pies. 
 Mark, you should get going. 
 They're expecting you. 
 Why do they want to talk to you, Dad? 
 Just routine, for them, at least. 
 It's all right, it's all right. I'll be back in two ticks. OK. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 What do we do today? 
 £4.79. 
 Thanks. 
 Mr Marshall, right? You run the Sea Brigade. 
 Karen White, Daily Herald. 
 I don't talk to the press. 
 What, have you got a policy about it? 
 I have. 
 But you're a newsagent. 
 I sell 'em. I don't want to be in 'em. 
 Why? 
 Don't get smart. 
 I'm just trying to find out about Danny. He did a newspaper round for you, didn't he? 
 Are you gonna leave nicely or do I have to ring the police? 
 Well, if you change your mind... 
 I won't. 
 Fair enough. 
 Bloody parasites. 
 Yeah. 
 20, is it? 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Brilliant. Yeah, cheers. Bye. 
 We're all here ready when you are, sir. 
 You do it. 
 I can't... I've never done that. 
 In you go. 
 Good morning. 
 Good morning. 
 I'm er... 
 Welcome. 
 I'm er... Ellie... DS Miller. 
 So we've got a lot to get through, we're already behind, because of the weekend and not having the resources... which are here now, which are you. 
 We just need to hit the ground running. 
 Priorities today, house-to-house enquiries, CCTV retrieval, technical data retrieval from phones, and alibi follow-ups. 
 And on top of that, we've had a lot of information in we need to sift through. 
 OK, thank you. 
 Very inspiring. 
 Don't ever do that to me again! 
 Just cos I'm not running to arrest Mark Latimer, I get thrown to the lions? 
 You didn't mention how we can discount Mark Latimer... or your own exhaustive list of suspects. 
 Don't harangue me! God, you're such a... 
 We need to interview your son. We should have an appropriate adult - not you, obviously. 
 Relative, maybe? 
 Latimer's downstairs. We should start. 
 Sorry about yesterday afternoon. 
 What with everything, I was a little hazy when you asked me those questions. 
 It's more that you tried to lie. 
 I was just confused, I suppose. 
 All the days are blending into one, you know. 
 The boiler that I said I'd done, that was Wednesday night. You know how it is. 
 And Thursday night, you were with a mate? 
 I was, yeah. 
 But yesterday, you could not remember their name. 
 It was Nige, who I work with. 
 OK. 
 So you couldn't remember the name of the man you work with all day? 
 Just the shock, I suppose, doing funny things. 
 We'll check with Nige. 
 Yeah, you go ahead, El. 
 You know where this is? 
 Yeah, that's the rental place on Briar Cliff, ain't it? 
 Ever been there? 
 Yeah, I was there a weekend or two back. 
 It was a burst pipe. When you say a weekend or two back - 
 I dunno, three at the outside. 
 Nicky, who does our paperwork for us, she'd have the exact date on the old invoice. 
 She's away with the kids this week, though. 
 If it's a rental property, who called you out? 
 I dunno. This woman. 
 I can't remember her name. 
 I picked the keys up from her at the caravan park. 
 Just you or your mate Nige? 
 No, just me. It was an emergency callout. 
 They were all worried about getting the place flooded or something. 
 Nige was away with his mum. 
 Mark, do you own a boat? 
 Yeah. 
 A boat, prints at the murder scene and an alibi made up overnight. 
 Ask Pete what Mark told Beth about Thursday night. See if it marries up. 
 And while we check, Mark stays here. 
 Know what it'd do to that family, and town, if it was Mark? 
 What are you looking for, Miller, an easy answer to this? 
 The least pain? 
 It won't work like that. 
 I know. 
 Do you? 
 Really? 
 There you go. 
 Ta. 
 You're having a right old go at that. 
 I have to keep busy. 
 I hate being shut up in the house. 
 I like to be out. 
 Mark says I'm like a dog, I need walking twice daily. 
 It's Danny's shampoo, I keep trying not to look at it. 
 Do you think I should throw it away? 
 What happens now? 
 We gave them a list of suspects. 
 How far have they got? 
 They'll tell us when they're ready. 
 They did ask. 
 The night before Danny was found. 
 You and Chloe were in watching TV. 
 Where was Mark? 
 He was out. 
 And he got back...? 
 I dunno, I was asleep. 
 He was working? 
 That's what he said. 
 But you don't know who for? 
 No. 
 OK. Thanks. 
 There it is, Mark's boat. 
 Are you all right? 
 Don't like being on the water. 
 We're barely on it. 
 It only needs one. 
 Minimise the risk of contaminating the crime scene. Go on. 
 Can you tell when it was last taken out? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 It's blood. 
 Hiya. 
 Morning. 
 Hey, gonna give me a header? 
 Go on, on my head. I'm ready. 
 Fine. 
 You overcompensate. 
 I know. 
 Hello! 
 You woke the dog. 
 You caught 'em yet? 
 Those kids ain't safe out there. 
 Um... it's Mark Latimer that fixed the burst pipe up at Briar Cliff a few weekends back? 
 Not to my memory. 
 He said he got the keys from you. 
 No. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 We never had a burst pipe up there. 
 When did you last clean up there? 
 Ten days ago. 
 There's been no-one in there since. 
 Who else has keys to the hut? 
 Me and the owners. That's it. 
 We're treating it as a possible crime scene. 
 I see. We'll send someone to do elimination prints. 
 Have we finished? 
 By the one-kilometre mark, Kevin was struggling. 
 I mean, he's 32 stone, doing five kilometres cross country. 
 Every step is a mammoth effort. 
 Shouldn't Mark be back by now? 
 It can take ages, this stuff. 
 But nothing to worry about? 
 No. 
 Of course not. 
 I'm going out. 
 Where? 
 Just out. 
 I'll come with you. 
 No, Mum, you stay here. I'll be back later. 
 Yeah, I was with Mark pretty much all night. 
 We met up, had a drive, a bite to eat. 
 Do you see him a lot socially? 
 On and off. 
 Where did you meet him that night? 
 The car park by Briar Cliff. 
 Why there? 
 Just convenient. 
 What time did you get home? 
 One-ish? I dunno, I didn't really check. 
 What did you do till one? 
 Drinking, chatting, bite to eat. 
 Where did you eat? 
 A pub in the Vale. 
 Name? 
 The Fox. 
 What did you eat? 
 Chips and um... and a pie. 
 A steak pie. 
 One-ish? 
 Are a lot of places open that late round here? 
 We get lock-ins at The Fox. 
 Ah. So they'll remember you when we talk to them? 
 I would've thought so, yeah. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Anything you want to revisit in what you've just told me? 
 I don't think so, no. 
 Nige, want to stop pissing about? 
 Your mum just said you were in with her all night till 10:30, then you went round the corner for last orders and not with Mark. 
 Since we talked earlier, we checked up on a couple of things. 
 Number one, the woman who holds the keys to the hut on Briar Cliff... has no memory of you fixing a burst pipe. 
 That's bollocks. I got the keys from her, I fixed it, I took 'em back. 
 She has a caravan, she has a dog. 
 She says not. 
 Well, she's lying. 
 Number two. Your alibi is rubbish. 
 Your mate Nige is not a good liar. 
 He's not lying, I was with him. 
 Let's not insult each other's intelligence. 
 Your son has been killed. 
 So I'm at a bit of a loss as to why you would mislead us. 
 Why'd you lie, Mark? 
 Wait, Miller, I haven't done point three. 
 Point three. 
 We had a look at your boat. 
 And there's bloodstains in it. 
 Whose blood's in the boat, Mark? 
 Dan's. 
 We took the boat out the week before last. 
 When we had the hot spell. 
 It was me, Danny and Chloe, fishing about a mile offshore. 
 We caught three sea bass, we took them back and we barbecued them. 
 Danny was messing around on deck, he caught the... 
 He caught the end of a line in the bottom of his foot and gashed it open. 
 And he was hopping around and yelling and screaming. 
 Chloe was there, so you can ask her. 
 We will. 
 Why are you lying about where you were on Thursday night? 
 How's this helping find Danny's killer? 
 We can't rule you out till we know where you were. 
 Everything's becoming part of this, ain't it? 
 It's got nothing to do with this. 
 Everything counts now, who did what, who was where. 
 Everything connects and feeds this case. 
 If we don't get the truth, we won't find who killed Danny. 
 That starts with you. 
 Just tell us about Thursday. 
 I've only told you, ain't I? 
 I told you about the hut, and you're saying I'm lying and I'm not. 
 Mark, my son dies, I'd tell a police officer everything. I just would. 
 Why did you ask Nigel to invent a false alibi? 
 I dunno. Everything I say is getting twisted. I can't think straight. 
 All right. 
 Mark Latimer, I'm arresting you for obstructing a murder inquiry. 
 You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court. 
 Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Is this what you do, El? 
 Just tell us the truth. 
 Miller, take his things. 
 Hiya. 
 Beth. 
 We weren't expecting you. 
 Can I help anyone? 
 No, we're fine. 
 Shall I restock the racks, Janet? 
 They're fine. Yeah. 
 Hi, Maggie. 
 Sweetheart, what are you doing? 
 I'm just coming to work. 
 Beth, you shouldn't be here. 
 You've had a terrible thing happen. 
 I just want to be useful. 
 Let me get you home. 
 I've just come from home. 
 I can't stay in that house. 
 This isn't the place. 
 I'll talk to your mum. 
 I'm not 12, Maggie. I don't wanna go home. 
 My heart is breaking... 
 I don't need bloody broken hearts! 
 All right, Nige? 
 Olly! All right, mate. 
 Never had so many visitors in a day. 
 Why, who else has been here? 
 No-one. 
 OK. 
 
 
 
 This is Karen from the Daily Herald. 
 Hi. 
 Don't think I should be talking to papers. 
 She's all right and I'm chaperoning. 
 Two minutes? 
 All right, quick, though. 
 How long have you worked with Mark? 
 Three years now. 
 Did my NVQ, Mark took me on and trained me up. 
 Everyone says you're the go-to men in the town. 
 That's down to Mark. He says, 'Keep it simple. Life's complicated enough'. 
 And the family are close? 
 Ah, yeah. Always doing something together. 
 That's Beth - outdoors girl. 
 Dragging them up hills, whether Mark likes it or not. 
 Compromise is what being married's all about, I guess. 
 Nothing's perfect. 
 And you knew Danny well, obviously. 
 Yeah. 
 He used to come out with us sometimes in the holidays. 
 He liked to... 
 Listen, I got a job, I got to go. 
 Hey, how's your mum now? 
 Erm... yeah, she's all right. 
 Yeah? 
 All sorted now? 
 Pretty much. 
 You'll be fine once you get stuck in. 
 I don't want to, Dad. 
 Go and bust some moves before we have to talk to the police. 
 Bust some moves? 
 Down with the kids. 
 Come on! 
 Hey, Tom. 
 All right? 
 What's this about Danny, then? 
 Do you know what happened? 
 Were you with him? 
 How'd he die? 
 Was it his dad? 
 Do you mind if I erm... 
 No. 
 Thanks. 
 I love this view. 
 Sorry if this is rude, but I know who you are. 
 Great. 
 I can't even imagine what it's like for you. 
 You'll get through it. 
 And you know, do you? 
 Look, erm... don't take this the wrong way. 
 I have a message for you. 
 It's from Danny. 
 No, no, no, don't you dare. 
 I promise you, he just - 
 Stop speaking to me! 
 Get away from me! 
 I'm not trying to upset you, I have to tell you... 
 Please! 
 So you last saw Danny when? 
 Before we went on holiday. 
 When was that? 
 Three and a half weeks ago. 
 Let Tom speak. 
 Sorry. 
 Three and a half weeks ago. 
 We went on the Thursday morning. 
 I saw him the afternoon before. 
 What time? 
 Straight after school. 
 And where were you? 
 He came round, we went to the lido. 
 Did he have his phone on him? 
 Don't know. 
 But Danny had a phone? 
 Did he say he was worried about anything? 
 No. 
 Did you argue? 
 No. 
 Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt Danny? 
 How did he get on with his dad? 
 Anything that you say here is completely confidential. 
 He said his dad hit him. 
 Once? 
 Maybe twice. 
 Recently? 
 I don't know. 
 He said his dad got into bad moods sometimes. 
 OK. All right, thanks. 
 They want me to tell you... Mark's been arrested. 
 And he's refused a solicitor. 
 What for? 
 He won't account for his movements the night before Danny was found. 
 So he's a suspect? 
 Let's see where we are once they finish talking. 
 You can't just do that - tell us he's under arrest then nothing else. 
 I'm sure it'll get sorted. Arrested isn't charged. 
 Sorted? My brother's dead - 
 Chloe, come with me. 
 Get off me! It's him you should be having a go at. What are you doing? 
 Get in the bathroom. 
 When I say, 'Enough', I mean it. 
 From now on, you say nothing in front of Pete. 
 He is looking at us all the time. 
 He is not our friend, he is their spy. 
 God knows what they're thinking, but I am not having them going through our stuff, thinking the worst. 
 We have to stay tight, even just you and me if necessary. 
 And Dad. It's not him, you don't think it's him. 
 You never really know anyone and we have to be so strong now. 
 And you have to be older than you are because I don't know where this ends. 
 OK? 
 OK. 
 Hey! 
 How'd it go? 
 Yeah, he was really brave. 
 Yeah. Charming, your new boss, ain't he? 
 Oh. 
 Wow. 
 Oh, I really don't like him. 
 He's been running the Sea Brigade for the last 15 years. 
 What is it, then, Sea Brigade? 
 It's pretty much Scouts with added boats. 
 Just lots of lads, resourcefulness skills, teamwork. 
 Danny did Sea Brigade, right? 
 Mm-hm. 
 And a paper round. 
 Is he married, this Jack? 
 We all did Sea Brigade. 
 But is he married? 
 Is who married? 
 Don't mind if I join, do you? 
 Funny thing, I saw you come in from across the road but had your boss on the phone to me. 
 My boss? 
 Saying he'd been trying you with no joy. 
 But he had a hunch you'd make contact with the local press. 
 Apparently, you've got AWOL. 
 In what way? 
 Karen? 
 I used to work crime. 
 At the Herald, there's no money for reporting, it's all been cut. 
 We just regurgitate press releases. 
 I should never have moved. 
 What's that got to do with you being here? 
 Alec Hardy. 
 I reported on Sandbrook. 
 I was in court when the case fell apart. 
 He failed that family. 
 I saw it happen and I'm worried he's gonna do it again here. 
 You're the last person I expected a phone call from. 
 You're the first friendly face I've seen in months. 
 If I'm the friendly face, God knows what the rest of them are like. 
 Oh, you have no idea. It is another world. 
 It's a bit cloak and dagger, Alec, meeting out here. 
 What's wrong with the office? 
 Small town, everyone's eyes on you. 
 Don't like it. 
 I uh... went through all the results you sent me. 
 So? 
 It's not good, Alec. 
 No. 
 You've got to change all of this. 
 No stress, no pressure, nothing that'll cause unnecessary exertion. 
 I can't. 
 You have to. 
 If you don't... you'll end up dead. 
 Ah, you bloody doctors! 
 Always, 'Do as I say or you'll end up dead.' 
 I'm serious! 
 Look, I'll make sure all the paperwork gets filled in. You can be invalided out. 
 Not till I'm done here. 
 You like it that much? 
 No, I hate it. 
 I hate the air, I hate the sand. 
 I hate the stupid people, I hate the way they work. 
 I hate their bloody smiley bloody faces. 
 I hate the never-ending sky. 
 Well, why be here at all? 
 It's penance. 
 What? 
 No... really? 
 Really. 
 Hi. Am I intruding? 
 No. Come in. 
 I just thought I'd see how you were. 
 I didn't say thank you. You were nice the other day. Want some wine? 
 No. 
 Have you spoken to anyone yet about the um... the pregnancy? 
 Just you. Lucky you! 
 I've been thinking about Danny. 
 I know it isn't possible to have a funeral until the police finish their investigation, but we could hold a memorial service for Danny's life. 
 A celebration, here, for you, for the town. 
 Maybe. I'd have to talk to Mark. 
 How um... religious would it be? 
 Whatever you like. 
 We can plan it so it reflects who you are... who Danny was. 
 Did I say something wrong? 
 'Was.' 
 Past tense. 
 My baby. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I just want to feel him close to me. 
 I want to hear his voice. 
 I want to know how he is. 
 He's with God now... in the care of the Lord. 
 Take comfort in that. 
 Tell God... give me a signal. 
 Something. 
 Let me know he's OK. 
 I'm under instructions to come in. 
 Chloe Latimer texted me. 
 OK. 
 Thursday night, Mark Latimer was with me. 
 We met in the car park and drove off. 
 We were together till about one. 
 Then I dropped him back at the car park. 
 Here you go, mate. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Chin up. 
 What were you doing? 
 Really? 
 Having s*x. 
 I know. 
 Worst decision of my life. 
 Hello. 
 I got your note. 
 Who is it? 
 Go to bed. 
 Why? 
 Because I bloody told you to, that's why! 
 Sorry, come in. 
 That's OK. 
 I'm surprised you called. 
 Not as surprised as I was. 
 Why didn't you tell us you were with Becca Fisher on Thursday night? 
 Why do you think, El? 
 You know this town. 
 If that got out... 
 You let us pursue this because you were worried about gossip? 
 No, not gossip. 
 Lives, mate. 
 My family, her business. 
 You don't understand, you haven't lived here. You don't know how these things stick. 
 Don't tell Beth. 
 I haven't done anything like this before, I swear. 
 With her? 
 Not with anyone. 
 I mean, I've had chances, but I've never done anything before this. 
 We're tired, though. 
 You know... I saw a chance of something else and I took it. 
 This has only been about Danny's killer. Why wouldn't you tell us? 
 Because I'm ashamed, innit? 
 The one time that I took him for granted and that's when I lost him and it... 
 Please don't tell Beth. Please. 
 Ooh, that's a lovely cuppa, thanks. 
 Why did Danny talk to you? 
 He didn't. He didn't. 
 I don't... 
 No, I don't see dead people or... 
 I have like um... like a spirit guide. 
 She tells me things about people who have passed over. 
 And over the years, most have turned out to be true. 
 So, earlier, I asked her about you. 
 And she said there was someone... someone close to you - a relative with an R or an S in their name... trying to come through to you. 
 Maybe a grandparent or... or someone who... who played the piano? 
 That doesn't mean anything to me. 
 No? It's OK, wires crossed, that's no problem. 
 Erm... 
 Tell me the message. 
 I should tell you that I don't choose what I'm told. 
 I'm just on the receiving end. 
 Just tell me. 
 OK. 
 Danny wants you to know he's OK. 
 He's being looked after now. 
 He says... don't look for the person who killed him because it won't help. 
 He says it won't help. 
 Because it'll only make you upset. 
 Because you know the person who killed him really well. 
 The hotel owner, do you believe her? 
 She's no reason to lie. 
 Aside from the fact they're sleeping together. 
 What if... Danny found out about Mark and Becca Fisher's affair? 
 What, so a father kills his own son to keep him quiet? 
 You think that's impossible? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm home. 
 Hey, you all right? 
 Mm. 
 Pete said you were arrested. 
 Yeah, they got their wires crossed. 
 It's fine, all fine. 
 Come here. 
 I'll be home soon. 
 How's Tom? Have you talked to him? 
 Yeah. He asked whether you thought he'd done it to Danny. 
 I hope you told him I didn't. 
 Yeah. 
 Then he asked why you were the police person looking into it. 
 Well, we're all asking that. 
 Anyway, how's the boss? 
 Same, as if it wasn't hard enough. 
 Smother him with kindness, El. 
 Isn't that your usual way? 
 El? Hello? 
 Are you still there? 
 Yeah. 
 Come home soon. 
 Wake me up. 
 You'll regret it. 
 Never have before. Love you. 
 Quite right. Love you too. 
 Can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt Danny? 
 How does he get on with his dad? 
 Anything you say here is absolutely confidential. 
 He said his dad hit him. 
 Once? 
 Maybe twice. 
 Miller? 
 Reconstruction, Thursday night, one week on. 
 Your boy Tom, he should do it. 
 What? No, I don't want him to. 
 He's the best choice. 
 Did you not hear me? He's lost his best friend, that could traumatise him. 
 Maybe he should be allowed to decide. I'm his mum, I decide. 
 So your commitment to this investigation stops outside these doors? 
 Sir, move away from me now or I will piss in a cup and throw it at you. 
 Talk to... 
 What's your husband's name - Joe? 
 Talk to him about it. And Tom. 
 You're invited for dinner. 
 What? 
 Pick a night. 
 At your house? Why? 
 Do you know many people here? 
 No. 
 Are you living off hotel food? 
 It's not a good idea. 
 Don't be an asshole about it, I don't want to do it either, but it's what people do. 
 Is it? 
 They have the boss round and don't talk about work. 
 What will we talk about? 
 I don't know! Just say yes. 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. Bloody hell! 
 Knob. 
 Did you tell them where you were? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you gonna tell me? 
 Not now. 
 Look at me. 
 Did you kill him? 
 What? 
 Did you kill Danny? 
 How could you even say that, Beth? 
 Is that what you think? Is that what you see when you look at me? 
 All you have to say is no. 
 How can you even say it? 
 You think I could kill my own son, do you? 
 Do you? 
 You think I could strangle him, do you? 
 For God's sake, Beth. What in God's name is happening to us, eh? 
 What time do you call this? 
 No. 
 Come on, five minutes. Couple of quotes, tell me where you've been, what you've been up to. 
 After what you did to me last time? 
 Legitimate investigation. 
 You turned me over. 
 You will never have anything out of me as long as I am breathing. 
 You let that family down. 
 I sat with them after the trial. 
 They still don't have closure because of you and I won't let you do that to another family. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You didn't have to tell them. 
 Got you out. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 Last Thursday... us. 
 It was a mistake. 
 Not for me, it wasn't. 
 If it wasn't, then it is now. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Timing. 
 Might have had something. 
 We still could. 
 No. 
 It don't change anything. 
 It changes everything. 
 I think... it may have been punishment for something, for what we did. 
 Go home.
