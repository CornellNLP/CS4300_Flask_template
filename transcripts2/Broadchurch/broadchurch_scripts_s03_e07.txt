 Previously on Broadchurch My name's Ellie. 
  I'm a detective with Wessex Police. 
  You called about an attack. 
  Who did this to me? 
  The day of the party Trish and me, we were in bed together. 
  I didn't do it. 
  You know that, don't you? 
  HARDY: Wessex Police. 
  Who are you? 
  Ed Burnett. 
  This is my shop. 
  Difficulty for us, Ed is that this is very similar to the twine used in the attack on Trish Winterman. 
  Results of Ed's phone's coming through. 
  - How many photos are on here? 
  - 5,219. 
  HARDY: That's not love. 
  That's obsession. 
  There was a serious sexual assault at the party on Saturday. 
  What, so you come for the cab driver? 
  Why are you lying to us, Lucas? 
  It's daft but I picked a fare up off the road. 
  He thinks he's a good liar but he's not. 
  HARDY: Trish is recently separated from her husband Ian. 
  It's not very nice seeing the woman you used to be married to, drunk and cavorting with a lot of strange men. 
  That stuff you did to the laptop I gave you, can you delete it? 
  MILLER: Where were you on Saturday night? 
  I was out with my girlfriend. 
  We had a few drinks at The Anglers, and then a kebab on the way home. 
  - What sort of kebab? 
  - Doner. 
  - Was the kebab shop busy? 
  - Don't think so, no. 
  - Do you believe her? 
  - Not a word. 
  My name is Laura Benson. 
  I live at 19 Hazel Grove, Kingsbere. 
  Two years ago I was raped and I never told anyone. 
  It was a mistake. 
  With Danny. 
  I didn't mean to kill him. 
  Take me through the night you killed my son. 
  - Dad. 
  - I've done my best for you Chloe. 
  I'm just sorry if sometimes that wasn't enough. 
  (DULL ROAR OF WAVES) 
  (GENTLE THUDDING) 
  (PHONE BUZZING) 
  Hello? 
  What you doing, Mum? 
  Get Lizzie dressed for me. 
  And put some clothes on yourself. 
  Why? 
  MILLER: Is that Daisy's bag? 
  I don't want to talk about it. 
  We work together, so whatever's going on in your life affects me too. 
  Especially since there's less than six hours left on a suspect, which is why I'm calling at this ungodly hour. 
  - So tell me what's happening? 
  - She's booked on a train. 
  She wants to go. 
  I've asked her not to. 
  I've begged her not to. 
  She said she'd sleep on it. 
  She's gonna call me at work and let me know. 
  You know what I'd do? 
  I'd tear her ticket up, put it in my pocket, go to work, done! 
  - I can't do that! 
  - Well, I can. 
  No. 
  No. 
  No! 
  Fine. 
  Well, it's your funeral. 
  Move your arse! 
  The custody clock's running down. 
  HARDY: Ed Burnett. 
  He's at the scene, just had a scrap, clothes are covered in grass and mud. 
  He's always obsessed with Trish. 
  - He's gotta be frontrunner. 
  - Yep. 
  Agreed. 
  - Except - Except? 
  What do you mean except? 
  Beth called me yesterday. 
  They tried to talk to the other woman who was attacked and she's not willing to disclose. 
  But she did say she was attacked after her car broke down. 
  She was walking home, as the breakdown service never turned up. 
  - Which breakdown service? 
  - They didn't ask, but we both know Jim Atwood runs a breakdown service. 
  We're about to interview Ed Burnett. 
  You're muddying the waters! 
  We've struggled to find a link between the attack on Trish and the other two women, and maybe Jim is that link. 
  Let me see what records he keeps for breakdown customers while you interview Ed. 
  Fine. 
  Just hurry up. 
  Oi! 
  (EXHALES HEAVILY) 
  Mark. 
  (GROANS) 
  Hi, Dad. 
  A fisherman reported your boat empty. 
  They called a lifeboat out. 
  They found you in the water unconscious with hypothermia. 
  Another ten minutes they reckon you'd have drowned. 
  I was with Dan. 
  What happened? 
  Where have you been? 
  I saw Joe (SIGHS) 
  and I talked to him. 
  There's nothing now. 
  There's us. 
  JIM ATWOOD: I bought the breakdown truck at auction a few years back. 
  You get paid twice, you see: once for the call-out, and once to fix the motor. 
  Who answers the calls? 
  They either come in here or I get them diverted to my mobile. 
  Do you keep a record of everyone who calls? 
  No, not always. 
  Although everyone we go out to will be up in the invoice books. 
  I'd like to take a look at the last two years' records, please. 
  What, now? 
  Yes. 
  Now, please. 
  How did your party suit get grass and mud stains on it? 
  I'd walked away from Jim didn't really know where I was going. 
  I was all wound up ended up in the woods, the other side of the lake. 
  I was walking and I slipped and I fell all the way down the bank. 
  What time was this? 
  Funny thing, when I was on my arse in the mud, didn't think to check my watch. 
  Can I make a wee suggestion, Ed? 
  Lay off the smart-arse replies. 
  Just keep it simple, and honest, yeah? 
  Ian Winterman er, says he had to talk to you about sexually harassing his wife. 
  Absolutely not true. 
  Why'd he say it, then? 
  We'd had a works do. 
  There was dancing, it was getting lively. 
  I was dancing with Trish, probably closer than I should. 
  If she was so bothered, why did she keep working for me? 
  Do you know a Laura Benson? 
  Don't think so. 
  Ever been to Abbots Chapel? 
  Driven through it, course. 
  - Been at the pub there? 
  - Not that I'm aware of. 
  What's this got to do with Trish? 
  What were you doing on Saturday 7th of June, 2014, Ed? 
  That's two years ago. 
  I know. 
  Off the top of my head, probably in the shop. 
  We're open seven days. 
  - What about 2am on the 8th? 
  - I'd have been in bed. 
  - Alone? 
  - Yes. 
  All right. 
  What about Thursday 28th of May, 2015? 
  I don't know! 
  I live behind the shop. 
  It takes me 50 steps to get to work. 
  The shop is my life. 
  I wish I could make you understand, that I would never hurt Trish. 
  Are you sure? 
  What if Trish told Ed she was thinking of leaving? 
  We know that he's in love/obsessed with her. 
  We know he relies on her, feels he can't live without her. 
  What if Ed thought he was gonna leave her? 
  What if she told him that night? 
  - But it's supposition - It's investigation! 
  - I'm theorising! 
  - Ellie's right. 
  It's supposition. 
  And you're out of time. 
  We have to let him go. 
  - I am nearly there with him. 
  - Nearly isn't any good. 
  Do you currently have sufficient evidence to persuade the CPS to charge Ed Burnett with rape? 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  I'm sorry. 
  30 seconds. 
  Sorry. 
  How you doing, sweetheart? 
  Can you take me to the station this morning, please? 
  I don't wanna do that. 
  Dad, don't make this difficult. 
  OK, I'll be there in 30 minutes. 
  If you're sure. 
  If you're really sure. 
  See you then. 
  OK, bye. 
  You all right? 
  So what's it going to be, Alec? 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  I'm gonna ask the custody sergeant to release you on bail. 
  I'll ask for conditions to be put into place during your bail time, namely that you cannot contact Trish Winterman or members of her family, either directly or indirectly. 
  And that you don't go round to her house or the house of any family members. 
  People round here are anxious and you're playing into that. 
  It's too sensational. 
  Too what do they call it clickbaity. 
  Oh, Maggie, I'm sorry you're not happy. 
  Plus, to the side of a story about rape you're running a sidebar of women in bikinis? 
  And then promoter stories about the ten hottest WAGS and weather girls! 
  We are funded by advertising. 
  You can choose what advertising to take! 
  A newspaper's identity is about what money you accept from where. 
  It's not like that any more. 
  It's all algorithms and analytics. 
  Oh, so so our reporting of a sexual predator is being subsidised and framed by soft p0rn. 
  It's just pictures. 
  It's nothing you can't see on a beach. 
  God's sake, Caroline! 
  How can you call yourself a feminist and let this pass? 
  I don't call myself a feminist. 
  Please tell me you're not the future? 
  (GULLS CRY) 
  - sh1t. 
  - You all right? 
  Dad, what are you doing? 
  - Stay here. 
  - Dad! 
  (CAR HORN) 
  Police! 
  Shut up! 
  Enjoying yourself, boys? 
  Get up! 
  Stand up! 
  Who of you shared the photos of my daughter around the school? 
  - Dunno what you mean. 
  - Oh, aye, you do. 
  You boys, you wee babies, that think they're men you hurt my girl. 
  So from now on I am gonna be watching everything you do. 
  I'm gonna be watching everything your parents do, everything your family does. 
  If any one of you even so much as belch when you shouldn't, I will be there. 
  - Are you threatening us? 
  - No, son, I'm instructing you. 
  Do you know what I do in my job? 
  Do you? 
  I deal with murderers, and brutal thugs, and s*x offenders. 
  And I win. 
  I get the better of them. 
  So don't for a second imagine I will break a sweat getting you in line. 
  Any of you come near, in fact, you even talk to no, no, you even talk about my daughter ever again let alone do anything to make her unhappy, I will find you, and I will cut your tiny little cocks off. 
  You can't say that to us. 
  You're the police. 
  I'm a father. 
  And I will do whatever is necessary to protect my daughter. 
  Right, piss off! 
  Let's see your ticket. 
  - Dad! 
  - You're staying here. 
  - (PHONE RINGS) 
  - Miller, I'm busy Nish just spoke to Laura Benson. 
  She used Atwood's breakdown services just before the attack. 
  I'm just saying it's a lot of money to spend on a weekly shop. 
  It's not real - Go inside, Cath. 
  - No. 
  Can you not just leave us alone? 
  We've got a few new questions. 
  Do you want to put the shopping down? 
  - You all right, Mum? 
  - Yeah. 
  Do you mind waiting here with Lizzie while I talk to your dad? 
  Mum? 
  Why aren't we enough? 
  What did you expect to get from him? 
  I just needed I needed to hear Joe say it. 
  You know, confess properly, like he never would in court. 
  I tried to record him on my phone, so I could give it to the police, but he took it off me. 
  So what did he say? 
  He just told me everything. 
  You know, how how Dan died. 
  And then he apologised. 
  Right. 
  So is it done? 
  Did you get what you needed? 
  Mark? 
  What do you want me to say to that, Beth? 
  That I'm all fine? 
  Did you mean to kill yourself? 
  I'm so tired, Beth. 
  I can't see anything ahead. 
  You know, it'd just be easier if all this went away. 
  Do you not think you could talk to us? 
  To me? 
  We did talk. 
  We talked all the time. 
  And it never helped. 
  I I wanted to do something. 
  I'm so sorry you feel this way. 
  I'm sorry you're lost. 
  I'm sorry you feel alone. 
  I am listening to you, I'm hearing everything you say. 
  But, Mark, your grief is still overwhelming you. 
  Please believe me, there are people who can help you. 
  - I've tried. 
  - But it's different now. 
  You've never been in this place before. 
  Put things to rest. 
  And live in the present. 
  Please. 
  Haven't heard if they've talked to Dad about your laptop? 
  (SIGHS) 
  We could go out. 
  I don't want to go out. 
  I don't want to see anyone. 
  - We could go for a walk? 
  - No! 
  Well, what if he's watching? 
  And follows us? 
  - What if he sees you? 
  - It won't happen! 
  How do you know? 
  I never thought any of this would happen to me. 
  It's not just me. 
  People are saying the same thing. 
  On Facebook, on all the chat groups: don't go out round here if you're a woman. 
  Nobody feels safe. 
  Everywhere's closing early. 
  I mean, how is he allowed to do that? 
  How is he allowed to control our lives like this? 
  HARDY: Jim, can you tell me where you were on Thursday 28th of May, 2015? 
  That's over a year ago. 
  How do you expect me to remember that? 
  Were you in the area? 
  As far as I remember. 
  I'd have been at the garage during the day. 
  And in the evening? 
  I'd have gone home. 
  If it was a normal day. 
  What about Saturday 7th of June, 2014? 
  - What? 
  Going back two years? 
  - Yeah. 
  Same answer. 
  Garage and home. 
  - Ever been to Abbots Chapel? 
  - Yeah. 
  Ever drink in The Rising Sun there? 
  Couple of times, yeah. 
  Ever done any breakdown or repair work for a Laura Benson? 
  I don't keep the name of every person I've done work for, in my head. 
  You tell me the car, then maybe. 
  Red Renault Clio. 
  Red Clio, er Erm Er Kingsbere. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, 30s, long hair, pretty. 
  If it's the girl I'm thinking of. 
  Yeah, she broke down. 
  Er I picked her up, took her car back to the garage and then I drove her home. 
  I dunno when this was, though. 
  About a year back? 
  June 2014. 
  Where you going with this? 
  You told me this was about Trish. 
  We're just trying to get to the truth. 
  Didn't like that, did he, Miller? 
  Looked proper rattled. 
  You seem much happier. 
  What happened with Daisy? 
  - Tore up her ticket. 
  - You took my advice! 
  - You know what I realised? 
  - What? 
  - I'm too nice to people. 
  - No, that's Never works, being nice. 
  I'm done with it. 
  Got 'em queuing up for you today, have you? 
  There's another one waiting, interview room two. 
  OK, erm my wife's computer. 
  That you took off me. 
  I Sorry, this is quite embarrassing. 
  I installed some I think the official term is spyware on it. 
  You've been snooping on your wife via her laptop? 
  It gave me access to her webcam. 
  So I could check in on her and see what she was up to. 
  Why would you wanna do that? 
  She often leaves it open, and on sleep, and this software accesses the in-built camera. 
  I didn't realise how easy it was. 
  Talk us through how you installed the spyware. 
  Well, I I Googled it. 
  "How to intercept a webcam. 
  " I downloaded the software. 
  And there's an installer, and you click on that. 
  And it sets itself up, and away you go, really. 
  Using Trish's own user account? 
  Yeah, yes We we always knew each other's passwords. 
  You're lying to us, Mr. 
  Winterman. 
  We don't have time for that. 
  - What? 
  - 15 minutes ago, I got emailed a forensic breakdown of the contents of that computer. 
  The spyware wasn't installed using Trish's user account. 
  Didn't get installed the way you described. 
  Hmm right. 
  You've come here and confessed to something you didn't do. 
  But you have knowledge of. 
  Which means someone else was involved. 
  - I can't tell you who that is. 
  - Why not? 
  I promised I'd keep their name out of it. 
  Have you forgotten what's happening? 
  Your wife was raped. 
  We're trying to find the person responsible. 
  What's the matter with you? 
  Do you have no shame? 
  All right. 
  Here's what you're gonna do. 
  You're gonna take a long walk and a few deep breaths, and then you'll call us, and give us the name of the person who installed that spyware for you. 
  If you haven't done that by the end of the day, I will come looking for you, and I will bring you back in here, under arrest. 
  Do we understand each other? 
  - Where did you hear? 
  - Harbour Master. 
  Don't worry, he's very discreet. 
  Is Mark all right? 
  What happened? 
  Was it an accident? 
  Deliberate. 
  - Oh, God. 
  Beth, I'm so sorry. 
  - Can you keep it out of the paper? 
  I can't bear people talking about us I've already spiked it. 
  What you don't print is as important as what you do. 
  Thanks, Maggie. 
  We're going to see him again later. 
  I'm just grateful they got to him in time. 
  What does it mean? 
  For him? 
  And you? 
  All coming out the woodwork now, though, eh? 
  My old boss used to say, an investigation's like a vice. 
  You put all these people in the middle of the vice, and you keep turning, and applying pressure, sooner or later, they crack. 
  Just a matter of time. 
  Thanks for that, Confucius. 
  If that's the case, why you are so antsy? 
  You never bloody know when it's gonna happen and how long it's gonna take. 
  That's what drives you mad. 
  Nothing else came back from the report on Trish's laptop, so if we have to arrest him later, we'll go through his devices then. 
  For now, keep on Jim Atwood. 
  Let's look at everything we've got. 
  OK. 
  I keep thinking of his wife's face when we took him away. 
  It's like she wasn't even surprised. 
  (RUSTLING) 
  (GLOVE BOX OPENS) 
  (RUSTLING) 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  (SIGHS) 
  What do you want, Cath? 
  I know this is a terrible question, but just say yes or no. 
  We're done, remember? 
  When you were raped did he use a condom? 
  What? 
  I'm sorry, I I just I've just gotta ask. 
  Yeah. 
  I put them in a freezer bag. 
  I thought they might be evidence. 
  Condoms. 
  I found them in my husband's car and with the receipt. 
  I'm bringing them to you because I thought you should know. 
  It's the time, you see. 
  On the receipt. 
  Five o'clock. 
  On the day of my 50th birthday party my husband was stocking up on condoms. 
  We're gonna need to search your house, Cath. 
  OK. 
  Would you be able to corroborate your husband's movements on two specific dates over the last two years? 
  Yeah. 
  He's sat there in the hospital. 
  And I'm listening to everything he has to say. 
  And it takes all my training, all the skills I've learned, to not just punch him in the face. 
  - Right. 
  - I'm so angry with him. 
  He has two daughters, one of whom is barely three years old. 
  How could he do this to them? 
  He knows what loss feels like, what it what it rips out of you. 
  You were right to go gentle on him. 
  - He's hurting. 
  - We're all hurting. 
  I'm hurting. 
  You're hurting. 
  The whole bloody world's hurting. 
  But he has to make it about him. 
  He takes all the oxygen, all the attention. 
  "Look at me, I'm Mark Latimer. 
  And I am so much sadder than the rest of you. 
  " And you know what that does? 
  It leaves no room for me. 
  No space for me. 
  He crowds out my grief. 
  And my grief my ongoing daily pain is as strong and as alive as his. 
  But I don't let it win. 
  He is selfish and weak. 
  Part of me wishes he'd succeeded. 
  And we're left to clear it up. 
  His family. 
  Like always. 
  And I'm sick of it. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I can understand that. 
  Aren't you supposed to tell me to see it from his point of view? 
  Yeah, I am. 
  But we've all done that. 
  And it hasn't helped, has it? 
  I've been with you both, this whole journey. 
  I've prayed for you, for Mark, for the girls, every single night for the past three years. 
  That you'll stay together, find strength in each other and heal. 
  But I don't know, maybe that's too simplistic. 
  But I get it. 
  I understand what Mark's going through. 
  CAROLINE: We need to talk about Mark Latimer. 
  I just heard what happened to him. 
  But not from you. 
  No. 
  We're not reporting it. 
  That family have been through enough. 
  I'm sure you'll write it sensitively. 
  I'm not writing it at all. 
  You were the one telling me you needed to be here to reflect this town. 
  And then as soon as a story comes along, you shirk it. 
  Don't take the moral high ground with me, Caroline. 
  Our readers want to know what is happening to Danny Latimer's family. 
  The Latimers are a family in crisis. 
  They need and deserve their privacy. 
  - It's not their choice. 
  - No, it's mine. 
 
 
 
  I am still the editor here. 
  Not if you don't publish this story. 
  I am so proud to be a journalist. 
  I've written some great stories, and uncovered important truths. 
  But I'm not writing about Mark Latimer. 
  So, I hereby fire you, and your declining industry from my life. 
  I quit! 
  And if I see anything about the Latimers in the paper, or on the website, I swear, I will slash your car tyres every week until they put me in a home. 
  As the Americans say "Screw you, petal. 
  " Just catching up on some schoolwork. 
  Sorry about earlier. 
  It's gonna be all right, Mum. 
  (TYPES ON KEYBOARD) 
  (FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS) 
  I'll go and get your stuff over from the flat in a bit. 
  - No, you don't have to do that. 
  - Yeah, I want to. 
  I thought, I can sleep here on the sofa, and you could have my room for now - just so you get some rest. 
  - No, Chlo. 
  Yeah, till you're better. 
  Till the two of you, you know, work everything out. 
  It's good to have you back, Dad. 
  You definitely all right with this? 
  Yeah. 
  Leave you to settle in, give you some space. 
  This is something we've gotta do. 
  Miller? 
  Do you know anything about this? 
  All over the local social media. 
  No. 
  Wow. 
  There's nothing of any relevance here. 
  Did you get anywhere with Jim's breakdown records? 
  The paperwork's diabolical. 
  It'll take a day or two to get through it. 
  Cath's told us Jim went AWOL towards the end of the night. 
  He's got no alibi. 
  He was buying condoms on the afternoon of his wife's party. 
  I've found them. 
  The calendars. 
  Erm Those are the dates that you were asking me about. 
  So, I was away for both of them. 
  He was here on his own. 
  - Well, they're condoms. 
  - Your condoms. 
  Found in your car. 
  By your wife. 
  She brought them to us. 
  Along with this receipt from a shop called Wessex Fuel. 
  Showing that you bought those at 5:03pm on the Saturday of your wife's party. 
  Directly on the route between your house and Axehampton House. 
  Who were you hoping to use these on, Jim? 
  Cos it certainly wasn't your wife, was it? 
  See, the problem for you is these condoms match the brand of condom used by the man who raped Trish Winterman. 
  And there are condoms missing from that packet. 
  When did you use the condoms, Jim? 
  Who did you use them with? 
  Your wife also confirmed that she was away on those other two nights when women were attacked. 
  So, unless you tell us otherwise, you don't have alibis for those nights. 
  Starts to look like you're responsible. 
  There was a waitress at the party. 
  Young, fit. 
  Saw her when they arrived. 
  So I went and got condoms. 
  So you left the preparations of your wife's 50th birthday party to go and buy condoms so you could have s*x with one of the waitresses. 
  She was flirting with me, as soon as she saw me. 
  Did you have s*x with her that night? 
  Yeah. 
  The same day that you had s*x with Trish Winterman. 
  (EXHALES) 
  - Yeah. 
  - You proud of yourself, Jim? 
  - No, I'm just a bloke. 
  I like s*x. 
  - How old was she? 
  Dunno. 
  19, 20. 
  Where did you have s*x with her? 
  In the woods. 
  Up against a tree. 
  Don't you look at me like that. 
  Cos you'd have done the same, if it was offered to you. 
  No, I wouldn't. 
  I don't subscribe to your version of the world. 
  But I worry about sending my daughter out into it, with men like you around. 
  Did you ask Trish to have s*x with you that night? 
  Yeah, I think so. 
  She said no. 
  How did you feel about that? 
  Like I had a better option. 
  (RINGING TONE) 
  (KNOCKING) 
  Hello, this is Ed Burnett, please leave a message. 
  (DOORBELL) 
  (KEYS JANGLE) 
  Dad? 
  You told them I was violent. 
  Yeah, well, you promised me I didn't need to worry about you being at the party. 
  You don't. 
  You were stalking a woman who's been raped. 
  - It's not like that! 
  - It's never like that, is it? 
  It's never your fault. 
  You've cost me my job. 
  You have no idea what this life is gonna do to you. 
  I've only ever done my best. 
  If I've lapsed or I've failed I've tried to put things right. 
  Dad, if there's stuff you haven't told me or the police, now is the time. 
  Please don't hide anything else. 
  (DANCE MUSIC ON LAPTOP) 
  Oi! 
  What you doing? 
  Get off! 
  I was trying to work out where Michael got the p0rn from. 
  Here! 
  Your computer. 
  He got it from you! 
  That is not what's going on. 
  What are you even doing with it? 
  - Look, everybody has it! 
  All right? 
  - No, they don't. 
  I don't! 
  Right, and you're the normal one, are you? 
  Don't put anything on me. 
  You're such a liar. 
  You think you're good at it, like you enjoy it, and you're just not. 
  This has been getting worse for years. 
  What else aren't you telling me? 
  Do you really wanna know the answer to that? 
  (BIRDS TWEETING) 
  How are you doing? 
  - Or is that a stupid question? 
  - Yeah, it's pretty stupid. 
  Yeah. 
  Can I come in? 
  (GROANS) 
  This is really bad of me, Trish, I can't pretend otherwise. 
  OK. 
  So, I I had some spyware put on your computer. 
  And I've been watching you through your webcam. 
  What? 
  Why? 
  Why would you even do that? 
  Because I missed you. 
  Because I I blew what we had. 
  And my life since then has been so empty. 
  There's this chasm where you used to be. 
  I just wanted to see you. 
  Be with you. 
  I I was I tried to take it off but the police got wind of it. 
  And I thought I should tell you rather than them. 
  Dad, what are you doing here? 
  Oh. 
  Oh, you know You OK? 
  This has to wait. 
  We're going out for a walk. 
  What? 
  No. 
  No. 
  - No! 
  - Yes, we are. 
  What is this? 
  Come on. 
  Did you do this? 
  He's not gonna win, Mum. 
  We shouldn't have to be scared. 
  (APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS) 
  Forgive me. 
  If you forgive me. 
  LEAH: Look. 
  I work for Chaz at the cafe on the High street. 
  He asked me if I wanted to help them out with this do. 
  I spoke to one of your people about this. 
  And did you tell them about you and Jim Atwood? 
  - How do you know about that? 
  - He told us. 
  What? 
  What's he going round telling people for? 
  What's that about? 
  He ain't got anything to be proud of there. 
  How do you mean? 
  Look, I'm not gonna lie. 
  I like a DILF. 
  - A DILF? 
  - A Dad I'd Like To Oh Yeah, got it. 
  Thank you. 
  We were setting up, erm had a bit of an exchange. 
  He's naughty. 
  And later, service was over He was being a bit cheeky, stashed me some champagne and asked if I wanted to go for a walk. 
  What time? 
  Half-elevenish. 
  Maybe midnight. 
  So we walked around, ended up in the woods. 
  We were getting on with it but I made him stop. 
  Why? 
  He was getting rough. 
  I wasn't into it. 
  I wasn't having it. 
  - And how did he take that? 
  - He was pissed off. 
  Didn't get his load away, did he? 
  You know what they're like then. 
  Jim Atwood was wandering the grounds, sexually frustrated, with a pack of condoms in his pocket, around the time that Trish was raped. 
  And he's still the only suspect who's ever come up with a DNA match on Trish, even if it was from when they slept together that morning. 
  Vice is tightening, Miller. 
  Right around Jim Atwood. 
  (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) 
  - Hello? 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm calling to tell you who installed spyware on the computer. 
  Hello, Leo. 
  MILLER: So you admit to installing spyware on Trish Winterman's laptop? 
  Ian asked me to do it. 
  So you just went along with it, no questions asked? 
  Yeah. 
  I mean, they're married. 
  But I I know it was a bad thing. 
  I should have fessed up earlier. 
  Why didn't you? 
  Didn't wanna drop Ian in the sh1t. 
  He helped me through a lot when my mum and dad were splitting up. 
  It's hard when you're 15. 
  He was my teacher at the time. 
  Without him, I'd have thrown myself on a railway line. 
  Certainly thought about it once or twice. 
  He listened and he helped me. 
  He saved me. 
  I owe him a lot. 
  What else aren't you telling the truth about, Leo? 
  I was at the party at Axehampton for a bit that night. 
  My girlfriend, Danielle, she's basically ditched me cos I had her lie to you about where we were. 
  Your girlfriend was there too? 
  She used to work at the farm shop with Cath. 
  She got invited. 
  I dropped her off early that evening, that's why I was there. 
  I didn't tell you cos I was scared. 
  I thought if you found out about the computer, and knew that I was there I dunno It's a big thing, a rape. 
  If my dad finds out about any of this, I'm out on my ear. 
  Job, home, everything. 
  I'm really sorry. 
  We can't charge him for installing spyware on someone's computer. 
  But he lied to us about being at the party. 
  Why do that? 
  His alibi's blown: where was he the rest of the evening? 
  It's still not enough to hold him. 
  Let him go, but we'll prioritise finding out where he was - the rest of the night. 
  - (BLEEP) 
  Bloody hell, the sock found on the Axehampton estate, confirmed as a match for Trish's DNA. 
  - Traces of her saliva. 
  - So it was used as a gag? 
  More than that, there are traces of one of our men's DNA on the sock. 
  Who? 
  What's so urgent? 
  I was moving stuff and I found this. 
  Never seen it before. 
  Dad, these are bloodstains.
