 Previously on Broadchurch... 
 The burned boat was my ex-brother-in-law's. 
 Who knew about it? 
 Everyone. It wasn't a secret. 
 You stay away. 
 I know men who would rape you. 
 You had s*x with someone else. Why? 
 Their dad, Mark... very quick to lie about where he was. 
 I'm worried about the phone? Did they find anything on it? 
 Get data off the handset? 
 Nothing. Everything's forwarded to another number. 
 I saw him talking to the postman. 
 You don't think I had anything to do with it? 
 I have insomnia. 
 So I'm often up late, wandering. 
 You rewrote the whole bloody thing, stoked it up. 
 Jack Marshall is a bloody paedophile! 
 There is an innocent man being hounded and you need to do something. 
 Certain he's innocent, eh? 
 Certain he's not? 
 Get away from the water! 
 Get away from the water! 
 Get away! 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 Get out of the water! (ECHOES) 
 They're bastards. 
 We didn't hound him, they did. 
 Now they're playing the innocent. 
 If you want to come to the funeral, you need a black tie. 
 Erm, the Chief Super is scaling our resources back. 
 What? 
 We've reached our budget ceiling. 
 As of next week, pulling back on staffing levels. She can't do that. 
 Well, that's what happens when a case drags on. 
 Bosses lose confidence, panic about explaining it to the accountants. 
 Well, how are we meant to solve it? 
 Chase forensics on the boat. 
 The results are our last remaining piece of clear evidence. 
 They're doing as much as they can but let me hassle them again. 
 You don't have to come to this. 
 What, cos of that? Bugger them. 
 I'm the worst cop in Britain. 
 Think they're right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll get you a T-shirt with it on. 
 Danny's killer's likely to be there today. 
 Now he's two deaths on his conscience, however indirect. 
 Let's see who's looking worried. 
 Welcome to St Bede's. 
 We're gathered here... assembled here... 
 We're assembled here today to grieve. 
 We're gathered here... to share our grief. 
 It doesn't seem right, burying Jack when they won't even let us have Danny's body. 
 Not until they have the killer, Mum. 
 But why haven't they got him? 
 Can we not do this now? 
 Mark? 
 Through here. 
 I was thinking I might go back to work. 
 When? 
 Any time. 
 Nige can't carry the load on his own, can he? 
 It's autumn. It's a busy time. 
 We need the money. 
 What do you think? 
 I hadn't really thought about it. 
 I mean, I could stay. No, no, you're right. We need the money. 
 I just got used to you being at home. 
 You still have me, love. 
 Or you could go back to the Tourist Information. 
 Have the dead boy's mum give you directions? I don't think so. 
 I'll be fine. 
 I've plenty to do. 
 (FOOTSTEPS) 
 No, no way. 
 I said black. 
 I didn't even like him. 
 Sorry, we're closed. 
 Look at you in a suit. 
 I didn't expect to see you. Not today. 
 How are you doing, Olly? 
 Good. 
 I did call. And text. 
 And email. Also Skype. 
 Yeah, it's been a mad time at work since they pulled me back. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I've beenlooking out for your by-lines, keeping up with your stuff. 
 I mean, it is a little bit tacky not to call. 
 I was embarrassed. 
 Why? 
 After they found Jack Marshall I couldn't stand being here, being part of the frenzy. 
 So you ran? 
 Yeah. 
 Hid, with a mate in Wales for four days. 
 It wasn't our fault, Olly. 
 Let's just keep telling ourselves that. Right, Olly. 
 Let's make a move. 
 The Invisible Woman returns. 
 Are you sure you should be here? 
 I felt I should pay my respects, yeah. 
 Should have done that while he was alive. 
 Or come to wash the blood off your hands? 
 Spare me the sanctimonious sh1t. 
 Jack Marshall made his own decision, took his own life. 
 He was hounded. 
 And what did you do? 
 Did you bring him in? 
 Did the police protect him? 
 No. 
 Your little town turned on him quite happily. 
 You've still got a murderer walking round out there and you want to blame me? 
 It's good to be back. 
 We're assembled here today to share our grief. 
 And to celebrate the life of Jack Gerald Marshall. 
 Jack Marshall was a good man. 
 As has been made clear since his death, an innocent man. 
 The local newsagent and Sea Brigade Master who kept children secure on land and safe at sea. 
 So how are we here? 
 We let him be smeared and intimidated. 
 We weren't there when he needed us. 
 So, today, in celebrating Jack, we also have to admit that some of us failed him. 
 Just as we failed Danny Latimer. 
 The Second Commandment tells us, "Love thy neighbour as thyself. " 
 In this, the darkest of times, we have to be better. 
 If we are not a community of neighbours, then we are nothing. 
 Do you think the killer's here? 
 A good chance. So keep an eye... 
 Keep an eye out, look out for anything out of the ordinary. Got it. 
 Do I urk you, Miller? 
 Seriously, you're only asking me that now? 
 Well done, you. 
 You gave us all what for. 
 I'm a bit worried no-one's going to speak to me again. 
 I'll speak to you. 
 Nice bit of community leadership. 
 Thank you. Just doing my job. 
 Hey. 
 Hiya. 
 Hey. 
 Mark. 
 Good to see you both. 
 I'll have a white wine and a beer for my husband. 
 Sure thing. 
 Paul, Beth and I changed our minds. 
 We don't want a memorial service any more. 
 We want a proper funeral, you know? 
 When it's all done. 
 Then we'd like you to speak, do what you did today, you know. 
 Whatever you want. Yeah, I'll be there. 
 Thanks. 
 That was a bit of a lecture back there, wasn't it? 
 Tore a strip off the town. 
 Not really. Unless you were worried it was directed at you. 
 Was it? 
 I came to you. 
 I told you that Jack needed protecting. 
 You did nothing. 
 You must be Lil. Hi, I'm Paul. 
 Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you. 
 Pleased to meet you. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Could write the bloody book. 
 Put this on my tab. 
 Bloody cash bar. 
 What did you find on Susan Wright? 
 We looked into it. I don't think anything was flagged up. 
 You don't think? 
 I wasn't on it. Someone else was. 
 I had hoped this would get your personal attention. 
 I'm in the middle of a murder inquiry. 
 I'm sure you can look into it yourself. 
 (LOW DISCUSSION) 
 (CLATTERING) 
 Whoa, there. 
 Whoa, there, big fella. 
 Hey, come on. One too many, is it? 
 I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 What's going on? 
 I've a favour to ask. Beth, I'm not reporting on this any more. 
 Until the killer's caught, the news desk won't feature it. 
 I know it's brutal. I'm sorry. 
 I just want to know what happens to us now. 
 How do you mean? 
 I want to know what it's like from now on. 
 Well, how do I help you with that? 
 You know the families from Sandbrook who lost their girls. 
 I want to talk to them, to someone who knows what this is like. 
 Can you arrange that for me? 
 OK. 
 Hey. 
 Is that Paul that I saw you with? 
 Yeah. 
 You get on with him, do you? 
 Did Danny get on with him? 
 Um, yeah, I suppose. 
 And did they ever talk privately or did they ever meet up outside of the computer class? 
 Well, I didn't really... 
 What are you doing? 
 We're just talking. 
 I hope so. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, I'm just going to go and play this. 
 Excuse me. 
 Where are you going? 
 Oh, hi, Tom. 
 If my mum and dad ask where I am, just say I've gone to the loo, OK? 
 Why? 
 Because I'm asking you to. 
 Because I'm Danny's sister and you're his best friend. 
 OK? What does everyone keep saying that? 
 I'm not his best friend. I hated him. 
 Whoa, take it easy. 
 And you know what, I'm glad he's dead. Tom! 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Oh, yeah, nine, nine. Skills from Lee. 
 Right, Tom, nine to beat. 
 Hello. 
 I was worried when I woke up. I didn't know where you were till I got the note. 
 Yeah, well, Tom was up at, like, six and he wanted to come down here. 
 They do this every morning now before school. 
 And I am the official scorer. 
 Tom. 
 That's a nine. 
 Yeah, dead heat. 
 All right, it goes to another round. 
 Are you having fun? 
 Anything to lighten the mood, eh? 
 How are you doing? You were a bit um... distant yesterday. 
 I was just looking round that bar at the wake thinking, "It's someone here. Why can't I see it?" 
 The longer it goes on, I'm just starting to suspect everyone. 
 When you say everyone... 
 Well, nearly everyone. 
 Shame, cos I am available for rigorous questioning in our bedroom every evening. 
 And bring your handcuffs cos I can be quite a troublesome prisoner. 
 Oh, Dad, get a room. 
 You're supposed to be scoring. 
 Right, I'd better go to work. 
 See you later. I'll bring the handcuffs. 
 Oh, promises. 
 How are you feeling about first day back, Chlo? 
 You want a lift? 
 I'm going to meet Jess and the others. They're going to walk me in. 
 She hasn't eaten. 
 You've got to eat, Chlo. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 Just a slice of toast. Or a banana. 
 No time. Going. 
 See you later. 
 Bye. 
 I'll pick you up at the end of the day. 
 Think she'll be all right? 
 I don't know. Will you, back at work? 
 I'm always all right, me. 
 Are you going to go and see your mum today? 
 Yeah. I've plenty to do. 
 When are we going to talk about the baby? 
 Not today. 
 You've been saying that for a month and a half. 
 We've got to plan, one way or another. 
 Have a good day at work. 
 Give my love to Nige. 
 Toast? Don't you get breakfast included? 
 Know what I did last night, Miller? 
 Dressed up as Lady Gaga? 
 I followed the vicar. 
 Paul Coates? What did you do that for? 
 I thought, he likes a walk of an evening. I wonder where. 
 Except yesterday evening he didn't walk. He drove. 
 To Yeovil. 
 Over the border to darkest Somerset. 
 All that way for a meeting. 
 What sort of meeting? 
 A meeting meeting. 
 Alcoholics Anonymous. 
 Our young vicar is an alcoholic. 
 Well, recovering alcoholic if he's going to meetings. 
 Seems interesting. 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe? Suspect alcoholics and you'll have to include half this station. 
 He didn't mention it. 
 Didn't think it relevant? 
 I want everything on him. 
 Last parish, old girlfriends. 
 Overdue library books. And what goes on in that computer class. 
 What's this? 
 Forensics report on the burnt-out boat. 
 Blood, hair and prints matching Danny's. 
 And paint chips matching the colour of Danny's skateboard. 
 What were they doing with Danny's skateboard on the boat? 
 And traces of a cleaning product, the same one used on Danny's body. 
 They were transporting Danny down the coast. 
 The killer tried to clean off any traces left on the body. 
 It was a domestic cleaning product nicked from supplies in the hut. 
 Which leads us to believe it wasn't planned, any of this. 
 Boat nicked from the beach, cleaning fluid nicked from the hut. 
 The killer was improvising. 
 Who, um... Who knew that the boat was moored there? 
 It wasn't a secret. Pretty much anyone who walked down on the beach. 
 And when did you last use it? 
 Oh, ages back. 
 Um... 
 We went paintballing down the coast, with Tom and Danny six months back maybe. 
 It was that really hot weekend in March, I think. 
 Tom's never been paintballing. 
 Oh, no, yeah, that's right. 
 Mark asked Joe because he knew you'd say no to Tom using weapons. 
 What? 
 So it was me, Tom, Danny, Nige Carter and Mark. 
 It was a legendary day. I've still got the pictures. 
 It's probably the last day I spent any time with Danny. 
 So all these people knew about the boat. 
 Knew how the motor started. 
 Yeah. 
 Who else? 
 Loads of people. 
 I mean, Mum lets people borrow it for cash. 
 Everyone's had a go at one time or another. 
 Brian, from the King's Arms. 
 Kevin the postman. 
 At least three of Tom's teachers. 
 Paul Coates too. 
 Olly's boat? 
 Yeah, once. 
 Probably more than a year ago now. 
 I thought, you know, being as I was here, I should be a bit more fishermanly... 
 So I took the boat and a rod and I caught... nothing. 
 Got a nice sunburn, though. 
 How long have you been going to Alcoholics Anonymous? 
 Explain to me why that's a relevant question. 
 Explain to me why it's not. 
 Oh, I see. 
 I make a complaint about your failings with Jack and you come after me? 
 Not at all. Why Yeovil? 
 So I can be anonymous, have privacy, and not bump into parishioners. 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 It's nothing to do with your investigation. 
 Were you drinking the night of Danny's death? 
 I haven't had a drink for 473 days. 
 He always this objectionable? 
 He's excelling himself. 
 In your last job, you assaulted a child after you'd been drinking. 
 I didn't assault him. 
 It was a joke gone wrong. 
 He was twice my size. 
 You have no alibi for the night of Danny's death. 
 Why would I kill him? 
 What possible reason can you dream up for me to murder an 11-year-old boy? 
 Come in and provide a DNA sample, will you? 
 It stands for Deoxyribonucleic acid. 
 A really long word. 
 It's in every cell in your body. 
 .. get that definition down, please. 
 It's important. 
 You definitely need to have that. 
 Hey. 
 You sure you're all right, mate? 
 That's the fourth time you've asked me that. 
 I have done this before, you know? 
 I know, but things are different now. 
 Nige, the whole reason I'm doing this is so I can forget everything's different. 
 All right. 
 Oh, God, Mark. 
 No, God's busy, so it's just me this time, Nicky. 
 Washing machine again, is it? 
 He's fine. 
 
 
 
 I recognise you from your photo. 
 Cate. 
 Beth. 
 Same. I recognised you straight away. 
 Wow. This is weird, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Karen said that you've got DI Hardy in charge. 
 Yeah. 
 God, Beth. 
 Listen, that man is toxic. 
 They lost evidence, they ballsed up the trial. 
 My daughter's killer is still out there because of that man. 
 Do not believe anything he says. 
 OK. 
 God... There's so much I want to tell you but I can't. 
 Listen, I'm sorry for what you're going through. 
 I understand the pain. 
 You're the first person to say that I've properly believed. 
 I know. 
 Do you get people who are so desperate to tell you how deeply they feel your pain and you're thinking, "Piss off. 
 You haven't got a clue. " 
 Yeah, it's like they stick to you. 
 They're so desperate for you to be grateful. 
 And they haven't got a clue about grief. Not real grief. 
 Not like this is. 
 Nicky. 
 I used to assume grief was something inside you could fight and vanquish but it's not. 
 It's an external thing. 
 Like a shadow. 
 You can't escape it. You just have to live with it. 
 And it doesn't grow any smaller. 
 You just come to accept that it's there. 
 I kind of grew fond of it after a while. 
 Is that mad? Am I too bleak too quick? 
 You're like the first person I've met to talk any sense. 
 What's it been, eight weeks? 
 Marriage still OK? 
 Um, up and down. 
 You? 
 Divorced. 
 Most couples with a murdered child divorce. You know that, right? 
 Um, my husband's gone back to work. 
 Wow. He didn't waste any time. 
 There's the man for you. Has to do things, can't bear to be thinking. 
 And my daughter, she's back at school as well... 
 I don't want to go back to work. 
 It doesn't feel right. 
 Of course not. 
 I keep feeling like I wish there was a handbook for this, a guide. 
 Cos minute to minute, what do I do? 
 I don't know, Beth. 
 What do you do? 
 I worked for a bit but got terrible headaches. I couldn't concentrate. 
 And also that nagging sense of pointlessness. 
 "What does it matter if I don't finish this work? 
 The worst has already happened. " 
 So how do you keep busy during the day? 
 Honestly? 
 I go to bed. I sleep. 
 Then when I wake up and it's still the same, I have a drink. 
 And then another drink. 
 Then I cry, for a couple of hours maybe. 
 Then I watch TV. 
 Unless it reminds me of my little girl. 
 Which it does. 
 And so I take a sleeping pill. 
 I'm sorry. You probably came here looking for answers. 
 I don't have them. 
 My life got stolen that day. 
 The best part of me was killed. 
 And I can't get back from that. 
 Maybe you'll do better than me. 
 Paul. 
 Oh, hello, mate. 
 I wanted to ask you something. 
 Sure. 
 If someone accidentally deletes something from a hard drive, is it gone for ever? 
 My dad accidentally deleted something. 
 No, there are recovery programmes. 
 If that doesn't work, a tech expert can probably get it back. 
 OK. Thanks. 
 I won't charge you this time. 
 (PHONE) 
 Yeah? 
 Mark. 
 Chloe left school at lunchtime and she didn't come home. 
 They let her? 
 Well, she told them she had an agreement she only had to do half days at the beginning. 
 You're joking? Her phone's going straight to answerphone. 
 She's not at home, she's not with Mum. 
 I don't know where she is. 
 It's all right. I'm coming. 
 She's got a what? 
 Boyfriend. 
 Since when? 
 I don't know. 
 When were you going to tell me about it? 
 I forgot. It was happening when all that Jack Marshall stuff was kicking off. 
 There was a lot going on. 
 You and I were barely talking. 
 So you like this Dean? 
 Did she meet him at school or what? 
 No. He's a bit older. 
 How much older? 
 17. 
 Brilliant. Brilliant. 
 And you're all right with this? 
 I'm far from bloody all right with it. 
 But I don't want to push her away right now, do I? 
 And you don't even have this 17... 
 He's lives on a farm past Bredy Hill, all right? 
 She'll be there and I'm sure she'll be all right. 
 How can you ever say that now? 
 Dean! 
 Chloe! 
 Chloe, darling! 
 Chloe. Chloe. 
 (MUSIC OVER HEADPHONES) 
 Mum, Dad. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Dancing. 
 Dean made me a happy room. 
 A what? 
 Somewhere she can just shut herself away. 
 Enjoy herself without feeling guilty. 
 What happened at school? 
 Everybody stared. 
 Like I was a freak. 
 I rang Dean. He came and got me. 
 I just wanted a break from being sad. 
 I loved Danny. You know I loved him. 
 But I need a break from being the dead boy's sister. 
 It's suffocating me and I know you can't understand that. 
 No, we do. Of course we do. 
 Don't we? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you keeping the baby? 
 How do you know? 
 For God's sake, Mum, I heard you fighting. 
 It won't take long. Have a seat. 
 Did you eat or drink anything in the last hour? 
 No. 
 Open your mouth. 
 So, what - religion took over the booze? 
 Swap one addiction for another, was it? 
 You enjoy trying to rile me, don't you? 
 Yes, probably. 
 What have you got against me? 
 Honestly? 
 You worry me. 
 You were so eager to get in front of the camera when this all kicked off, like you wanted to own it and claim it for the church. 
 You were in the Latimers' like a fly in shite. 
 Wow. 
 I watch this happen every time. 
 A terrible event and the church piles in gleefully. 
 Cos suddenly people are paying you attention. 
 For the rest of the year, you're just that building nobody goes in. 
 You have no concept of faith, do you? 
 I didn't muscle in. People turned to me. 
 People who wouldn't think about religion. 
 They asked me to speak. 
 They asked me to listen. 
 They needed me. Do you know why? 
 Do you know why they came to me? 
 Because there was a fear that you couldn't address, a gap that you couldn't plug. 
 Because all you have is suspicion and an urge to blame whoever is in closest proximity. 
 Look, you can accuse me, you can take samples, belittle who I was in the past, but you do not get to belittle my faith just because you have none! 
 People need hope right now and they are certainly not getting it from you. 
 Are we done? 
 No, petal, I didn't die. 
 I just moved to Dorset. 
 Looking for anything from your archives on a Susan Wright, any time between 1985 and 2000. 
 There's a bottle of Jameson's in it for you. 
 Uh... I'll email all my details through. 
 Ring me when you've had a look through it. 
 OK. Love to the family. 
 Ah, Olly, haven't got any plans for tonight, have you? 
 Yes, I was going to meet... 
 Good. Put your bag down. 
 Help me finish looking through this old Rolodex here. 
 If the police won't follow up on Susan Wright, we'll have to do it ourselves. 
 We'll be like Woodward and Bernstein. 
 Are they like Morecambe and Wise? 
 God, I hate the young. 
 Yeah? 
 It's Finley's last day. 
 Right. 
 Which one's Finley? 
 Tall... dark hair, lopsided haircut. 
 Oh, him. OK. 
 They're all going to the pub for a quick drink. Yeah. 
 No. I have stuff to... um... 
 Obviously... 
 Get him a round or something on me. 
 Sure you don't want to? 
 Not really. Too much stuff here. 
 It's probably more like 30 for a full round. 
 Oh... OK. 
 Er... 
 You all right? 
 Yep. (COINS RATTLING) 
 Not even a quick one? 
 Tell... um... 
 Finley. 
 Finley. Tell him... 
 Well done. 
 He'll be overjoyed. 
 He's got you a round. 
 (BLEEP) 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Just checking in with your voicemail, as usual. 
 If you get a chance, give me a call. 
 It's been a long time. 
 I mean, I know... I know you're busy with school and home and... all the other things you do, but... 
 I do think about you. Every day. 
 Sorry. Not getting soppy. Sorry. 
 You had my word on that. 
 Um... 
 We could do video call, couldn't we? 
 I'd like that. 
 You could be my first video call. 
 Before you forget what I look like. 
 Right, well, that's me. 
 This is Dad signing off. 
 I love you, darling. 
 Please give me a ring. 
 Olly : Who still uses a fax? 
 Terry here would still use ink wells if they'd let him. 
 But I'll tell you what. He knows where to find anything you need. 
 Golden, this is, Olly. 
 Come here. 
 Vince. Vince. 
 Hello again. Remember me? 
 Susan. 
 Oh, hi. 
 You're out early. 
 Yeah, I'm just walking. 
 You want to be careful. 
 You know this is near where that boy died. 
 I knew him. 
 He used to be my friend. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 Thanks. 
 It's Tom, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, do you want to come and feed Vince with me? 
 He'll love you for ever. 
 OK. 
 Come on, then. 
 Here we are. 
 There's a good boy! 
 There's a good boy! 
 Come on. 
 In you go. 
 Come on, in you go. Good boy. 
 There you go. That's it. 
 I've got a selection. 
 Go on. Help yourself. 
 Don't just take one. Take a few. 
 There you are. 
 He likes you. 
 Um, you said I could take him out for a walk some time? 
 Yeah. Of course you can. 
 Well, you know where we are now. 
 You can take him any time you like. 
 Did you really know that boy who died? 
 Yeah. He was my friend. 
 That can't have been nice for you. 
 Well, my mum's in the police. 
 She's a detective on the case. 
 Is she, now? 
 Come here, Tom. 
 I want to show you something. 
 Well, come on. Don't be shy. 
 Have a look in here. 
 Do you know what it is? 
 It was Danny's. 
 That's right. 
 I've been looking after it. 
 But if you were a friend of his... then I think it's only right that you have it. 
 Don't you think? 
 That you, buddy? 
 Yep. 
 Dad! Come and look what I've got. 
 Mate, why aren't you in school? 
 Hello, you. You OK? 
 Tom, what's that? 
 It's Danny's skateboard. 
 Mate, why have you got Danny's skateboard? 
 Tom... Tom, put it down. 
 Why? 
 Put it down really gently. 
 No-one else is gonna touch it. 
 Tom, tell me the truth. 
 You won't be in trouble. 
 Where did you get that from? 
 Someone gave it to me. 
 Who gave it to you, sweetheart? 
 Cover the back. You, come with me. 
 Susan, it's DI Hardy. 
 Can you open up, please? 
 Right, get it open. 
 Get SOCO here. We have to find her. 
 She can't be far. 
 (PHONE) 
 Thank you for popping in, Susan. 
 I did a little digging on you. 
 Friends in low places, see. 
 I know about your husband. 
 And your children. And what was said but never proved about you. 
 What do you want from me? 
 You threatened me. 
 And I want you to know that I'm the one who dobbed you in to the police. 
 Isn't that right, Detective Inspector? 
 Hello, mate. How are you doing? 
 You know me, don't you? 
 She leave you here all on your own? 
 Can't have that, can we? Come on. 
 Come on. 
 You are awesome. 
 I know, petal. Watch and learn. 
 Where's the dog? Where's my dog? 
 Where's my dog? 
 Bloody answer me! 
 Where is the dog? 
 Where is my dog? 
 Dad, what are we doing here? 
 What do you think? 
 Right... 
 Here's yours. 
 Beth. 
 Let's see who wins the most, eh? 
 Who can get the most value out of the 2p-ers. 
 Is he being serious? 
 Are you serious? 
 Of course I'm being serious. Come on. 
 See who wins the most. Give it a go. 
 That one looks annoying. 
 I think those ones could go. 
 Yes! 
 (LAUGHS) Yeah! 
 It's mine. 
 It's mine. 
 (SOUNDTRACK COVERS SPEECH) 
 Now, was that good or was that good? 
 That was good. 
 We did this all the time when you were little. 
 Yeah, when it was pissing it down with rain. All four of us. 
 Danny would've spent it all on the grabbers. And lost. 
 We'll have to bring the baby when it's born. 
 They love all the noises and flashing lights. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we will have to do that. 
 Why did you have Danny Latimer's skateboard? 
 Why did you give Danny Latimer's skateboard to Tom Miller? 
 What's your favourite colour? 
 I can do this all day. 
 Not by the look of you, you can't. 
 I want to see my dog. 
 What, solicitor not good enough? 
 I ain't saying anything until I've seen my dog. 
 I don't think you're in a position to bargain. 
 We'll see. 
 Take some thinking time. No rush. 
 Find her b*st*rd dog! Now! 
 What are we gonna do with you, boy, eh? 
 (WHINES) 
 (WHIMPERING) 
 Tom? 
 What are you doing? 
 (PHONE) 
 Hello? 
 Sir. 
 Tell me you found the dog. 
 No, but... 
 Find the dog. We need the dog. 
 Sir, shut up for a second. 
 Did you tell me to shut up? 
 There's been a break-in at the cliff-top hut. 
 The murder scene? That's sealed off. 
 A report of torchlight inside. 
 Don't stand there wittering, Miller. 
 Come on! 
 Aargh! 
 Sir! 
 Come on! 
 Suspect heading for boatyard.

 Stop! 
 We know you're in there. You are surrounded. You can't get out. 
 (PHONE) 
 Bollocks! 
 (RINGING) 
 Oh! Sir! 
 (GROANING) 
 Sir! What? 
 Aargh! 
 Sir, what is it? Sir, what's the matter? 
 OK, OK. Get after him! 
 Get after him! Get an ambulance! 
 Control. Ambulance required.
