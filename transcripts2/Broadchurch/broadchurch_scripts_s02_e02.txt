 Previously on Broadchurch: 
 There were two girls. Cousins. Lisa Newbury, 19, was babysitting for her 12-year-old cousin Pippa. Pippa's parents went away for the night to a friend's wedding. They came back the next day and both girls were gone. 
 Our main suspect was a man called Lee Ashworth. 
 Lee's my husband. I think he's back and looking for me. 
 You've been hiding her here? 
 It's sort of witness protection. 
 Joseph Michael Miller, how do you plead? 
 Not guilty. 
 No! 
 He can't. 
 You know that I'm defending Joe Miller. 
 I'll be prosecuting. 
 Joe's legal team have requested a new autopsy on Danny's body. 
 I hope you rot in hell! For what you've done to us. 
 Why are you so sure he killed those girls? 
 At fixed intervals during the probationary period you'll have a review. 
 Conducted by the Learning Development Officer. 
 This will establish whether or not you have met the required standards to be an efficient and effective police officer. 
 Why the hell did you say yes to this job if you don't enjoy it? 
 Not that bad, am I? 
 You'll demotivate our entire intake. 
 The boredom drips off you. 
 I was good at my job. 
 Yeah, and you're no longer fit for it. 
 So get good at this one or do something else. 
 TV : Over-achievers have an inherent fear of failure. 
 (phone rings) 
 (message tone) 
 "You have one new message." 
 "Claire, it's me. 
 You should answer. I wanna hear your voice. 
 Look, I want you to know... 
 I love you. I've been thinking about you all this time. 
 Listen, I know it hasn't been easy. 
 But I'm close now. 
 I'll see you soon." 
 (mobile rings) 
 Hi. 
 Alec, Lee just called and left me a message. How did he get my number? 
 OK. What did he say? 
 He said he's close. 
 Claire, I promise you're safe. Just stay there. 
 I've gotta go. 
 Alec, please don't go. 
 What do you want? 
 Where's Claire? 
 Why would I know? 
 Don't mess me about. 
 I wanna see her. 
 Lisa Newbury's parents wanna see their daughter. 
 For the last time... I had nothing to do with that. 
 I don't believe you. 
 You got it wrong. 
 It's over. 
 Not for the parents. 
 Not for me. 
 What about for me? 
 I lost my whole life cos of you. 
 I had to leave the country. 
 So why'd you come back? 
 I want my life back. 
 Now tell me where I find Claire. 
 Or do I have to follow you around everywhere? 
 Yeah, give it a go. 
 Here's my number. 
 You tell her to call me. 
 Sorry about your health. 
 What did you say? 
 Someone said you were sick. 
 Over a little further. 
 Careful with those. They go upstairs in my office. 
 And don't scratch the paintwork. 
 See ya. 
 Bye. 
 I hope shitface has got a good reason for not reporting this. 
 Not that I'm finding much. 
 I appreciate the favour anyway. 
 When are you gonna come back to work here, then? 
 Not gonna happen. 
 Not as good as Devon, is it? 
 No. 
 Erm, I wondered if you still wanted to go for that drink. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Or not. 
 No. It's just that... I'm seeing someone now. 
 Course you are. Quite right. 
 Better finish up. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Nothing. 
 Put it away! God's sake! 
 Don't have a go at me. 
 How dare you! I ask one wee favour. 
 Why have you got that? 
 None of your business. 
 You've made it my business. 
 (phone rings) 
 What? 
 Yeah. Actually I'm with her right now. 
 The second autopsy provided no new information or suggestion that the first autopsy had overlooked anything. 
 They dug him up for nothing. 
 Just so that your Miller could have a bit of fun. 
 I was thinking... we should have a date. 
 What do you mean? 
 Go out, you and me. 
 You know, last chance till the baby comes. 
 We could go to the pictures. Take our mind off the trial. 
 What do you wanna go to the pictures for? 
 We got a big telly to watch things at home. 
 Dinner, then. A meal out. 
 How much will that set us back? 
 Stop going on about money. Bloody hell. 
 We've got a new baby coming. That's one wage. 
 Half me old customers aren't calling cos they don't know what to say. 
 One night. 
 Before it's nappies and night feeds again. 
 We don't see each other. 
 We see each other every day. 
 We don't talk about important things. 
 Let's do this tonight, all right? I'm late. 
 Did she say what she wanted? What do you think it is? 
 I don't know. Stop wittering, Miller. 
 Ashworth came to see me earlier. 
 Said he's looking for Claire and he's not gonna stop till he finds her. 
 Well, you said that's what you wanted. Now you've got it. 
 Alec Hardy. 
 I know. 
 Ellie. Ellie Miller. 
 Come in. 
 Wow. Look at that view. 
 I've always envied this house. 
 How long have you been here? 
 Please have a seat. 
 Do both of you understand how a prosecution case is built in court? 
 It's my responsibility to prove your husband's guilt beyond doubt. 
 And I do this by building a wall of evidence, in front of the jury, brick by brick. 
 Each piece of evidence is a new brick. 
 When it's built, the wall is unassailable. 
 Right. 
 Some bricks are more important than others. 
 Cornerstones, for example. 
 A confession by the accused. 
 Absolutely crucial. 
 What did you call us here for? 
 You assaulted Joe Miller in the interview room at Broadchurch police station. 
 While you stood and watched. 
 Oh, God. 
 I have seen the tape. What the hell were you doing? 
 I was upset. I didn't believe what was happening and I asked to see my husband. 
 Police brutality? Extracting a confession through violence? 
 It had been a very intense day. 
 It was an error of judgement but I had her removed as fast as I could. 
 How am I supposed to deal with this in court? 
 Hm? 
 Do you realise how the defence will use this? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 But how can you not have realised this was coming? 
 Well, he confessed. He was gonna plead guilty. 
 And you giving him a kicking gave him an opportunity not to. 
 If they don't get it excluded straight away, which is a definite possibility, you have to go on the stand and defend it. 
 So you better start thinking how you're going to justify what happened that day. 
 Because we need this evidence in. 
 We can't afford to lose this confession. 
 His confession happened before I even saw him. 
 Won't make a blind bit of difference. 
 All the defence need to do is connect the two events by suggestion. 
 You have jeopardised my best chance of success before we even got going. 
 Why didn't you stop me that day? 
 Oh, it's my fault now? 
 Why did you let me see him? 
 I felt sorry for you. 
 I didn't expect you to go all Bruce Lee on him. 
 Everyone will find out now. 
 sh1t. Tom will hear about it. 
 His mum beating up his dad in a police station. 
 Oh, God. What do I do? 
 I just wanna run away or hide of emigrate or... 
 Oh, God. 
 What have you eaten today? 
 KitKat and a Scotch egg. 
 It's not too late to change your plea. 
 I can't do that. 
 You can stop a lot of suffering. 
 Mark and Beth... they don't need to be put through this trial. 
 Have you seen Fred? 
 I thought maybe you could get a picture of him. 
 Bring it in for me. He must have grown so much. 
 I don't think that's appropriate. 
 Well, Tom, then. 
 If you see him, tell him I think of him every day. First thing. 
 Tell him I love him. 
 And that I'll be coming home soon. 
 I'm not gonna do that, Joe. 
 I thought you wanted to help me. Why have you come here otherwise? 
 Whose side you on, Paul? 
 (phone vibrates) 
 Hi, Beth. 
 Oh, hi. Where are you at the moment? 
 Oh, just, uh... out. 
 Oh, OK. I've come to put flowers on Mum and Danny's graves and I fancied a chat. 
 Ah, I'm sorry. 
 I'm a way aways. 
 Tricky parishioner. 
 OK. Can we find time soon? I'd love to talk to you. 
 Yeah. Definitely. 
 Why don't I, uh, give you a call when I've got my diary in front of me? 
 OK. Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Second autopsy turned up nothing new. 
 Oh, well. It was a worth a go. Might have rattled Jocelyn a bit. 
 I've been through the statements from the CID team. Nothing new there. 
 But I did track down the station cleaner. 
 Now, she likes a chat. Very good on office gossip. 
 Anyone else spoken to her? 
 No. 
 Nice. Well done. 
 You're very welcome. 
 What do you want to do about the confession? 
 I don't know. We'll see. 
 What shall we do for dinner? Is there anywhere good? 
 I think it's a risk. Even with the treatment of Joe Miller in custody. 
 I think there's a Thai. They're usually reliable, even in a place like this. 
 Don't change the subject. What's our game plan? 
 I need to know what our strategy is. 
 We put the prosecution to proof. 
 Jocelyn will try and build a wall of evidence and we smash holes in it. 
 After that, I'll take a view. 
 No point making plans till we know what they've got. 
 Do we try and exclude Miller's confession? 
 Stop nagging. I'm still thinking. 
 Is this really the only place to stay? 
 Yeah, afraid so. 
 Did you have any hot water this morning? 
 No. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. How's the stay? 
 Brilliant. 
 Love it. 
 Anything you need, just let me know. 
 Will do. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Fat lot of use you are. 
 Claire needs to meet Ashworth. 
 I wanna put them together. 
 And you don't see that as a risk? 
 No. No, it's not a risk, it's an opportunity. 
 It's only gonna come once. 
 Do it officially. 
 Talk to Jenkinson or one of your old bosses. 
 Nobody cares, Miller. 
 The case is tainted. Nobody wants to get near it. 
 That's my failing. I've got to put it right. 
 What if he didn't do it? 
 What if you're wrong? 
 Just help me convince Claire. 
 You risked everything for me and I let you down. 
 Yes. 
 But there are two families back in Sandbrook. 
 The Gillespies still don't know who killed their daughter. 
 The Newburys don't even have a body. 
 Why is this on me? 
 Cos he trusts you. 
 Don't make me see him. 
 We'll protect you. 
 No, I can't go back into that place. 
 Come on, get your coat. 
 What for? 
 Miller? 
 Ignore him. We're gonna get some air. Come on. 
 These are the best chips I've had in my life. 
 I'll let you into a secret. 
 I had salad earlier. I hate salad. 
 How have you not gone crackers up in that cottage? No work, no friends? 
 I know. 
 I used to be a hairdresser before all this. Talking all day. 
 Will you do mine one time? 
 If you like. 
 Is that how you met your husband? 
 More or less. 
 Client of mine was having a barbecue, I was new to the area, he was there. 
 Fancied him soon as I saw him. 
 It was like a chemical reaction. 
 Three hours later I was shagging him on his floor. 
 You weren't. Wow. 
 I've never done anything like that. 
 You must have. 
 I haven't. 
 How'd you meet your husband? 
 Best not. 
 Oh, go on. 
 It was a traffic accident. 
 A little old lady in a Nissan Micra. 
 Gone into the back of a Land Rover. Bit of a bump. Just minor whiplash. 
 I was a WPC and Joe was a paramedic. 
 He was kind and twinkly. 
 And I thought, "I like the look of you." 
 I didn't tell him, though, for another six weeks. 
 Then we kept bumping into each other. 
 He said, "We must stop meeting like this." 
 Do you think he killed those girls? 
 I can't bear to think about it. 
 Do you think he was capable of it? 
 I don't know. Do you think your husband was? 
 Claire, if you did agree to meet Lee... 
 I put myself on the line before and it went wrong and I ended up a prisoner down here, Ellie. 
 I understand what you're going through. 
 No, you don't. 
 But if you're still hiding, what happens? 
 The Sandbrook family will never get the truth. 
 Not my responsibility. 
 I know you don't want it to be but I think it is. 
 Look what these men have done to us. 
 It was like I was addicted to him. 
 Like he was my drug. 
 And I broke that habit, Ellie, and I'm... I'm afraid if I'm near him again. I'm scared. 
 We'll look after you. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Cos my life, my old life, is gone. 
 And I made so many mistakes. Some big ones. 
 And I need to put something right. 
 We could do it together. 
 When the trial starts tomorrow, we'll be running a live blog. 
 There's a dedicated page on the Echo website and I will be posting hour by hour coverage of the trial. 
 Try not to sound like you're enjoying it too much. 
 I'm not apologising for what we do. 
 You don't sound so keen. 
 I assess things once the dust has settled. 
 Write up the bigger picture. 
 By which time everyone has moved on. 
 I'm still your boss, petal, blog or no blog. 
 
 
 
 Hi, Jocelyn. Thanks for coming. 
 I had a message you needed to see me urgently. 
 Yeah. Everyone, Jocelyn's here. 
 No. 
 Oh, sorry. It just sort of mushroomed. 
 We wanted to thank everyone for being witnesses and giving evidence for Danny. 
 I just thought you could clue us in on what to expect. 
 It's completely inappropriate. I shouldn't be here. 
 We didn't know. 
 We haven't done this before. Sorry. 
 A criminal trial is a detailed, unpredictable process. 
 There are no guarantees. 
 We have a difficult task ahead. 
 If you've been called, don't confer on your evidence. 
 And never lie. Lies get exposed in court. 
 You're fine there. None of us have got anything left to hide. 
 I'll do everything I can to secure a conviction but it's not just down to me. 
 It's on everyone in this room. 
 Everyone in this town. 
 Now, I - I really shouldn't be here. 
 Weren't expecting that, were you? 
 Got ambushed. 
 How's it going, then? 
 Are you ready for the battle ahead? 
 Would you read to me? 
 Ooh. War room. 
 You got everything you need? 
 Only the Wi-Fi's not working. 
 Yeah, that's down for the night, I think. 
 Um, you could use my phone if you need to send stuff urgently. 
 No. Thanks. 
 Hey, erm, she's quite chatty next door. 
 I've had complaints from the room the other side. 
 The walls aren't the thickest. 
 Oh. Erm, she's on the phone. I can't interrupt her. 
 Do you know when she'll be finished? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, thanks. 
 No, don't say things like that. 
 Seriously, don't. 
 I'm not having it. 
 Look, you've got to sort yourself out. 
 Nobody else can do it for you. 
 You can't change what's happened. 
 Now it's about what happens next, and that's down to you. 
 No. No, actually I do. 
 All right. 
 I love you. Yeah. 
 All right. 
 All right. Call me again... 
 She'll do it. Claire's agreed to meet him. 
 Oh, man. I could kiss you. 
 Just promise me that she'll be safe and you won't do anything reckless. 
 She'll be safe. 
 Nothing reckless. She'll be safe. 
 Good night. 
 See you. 
 Don't fidget, don't mutter to yourself. 
 Don't shake your head if a witness says something you disagree with. 
 Stay neutral. 
 Don't make eye contact with the jury members. 
 The navy tie is better. 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 Got bloody lost. Thought I'd cycle in and went the wrong way. 
 Haven't quite got my, er, bearings... yet. 
 So, how are you both? 
 Sharon, nice to see you again. Jocelyn, don't think we've - 
 No. 
 Is this the door? 
 You should see the apartment they've given me. 
 Oh, please. 
 Right. 
 We are gonna run this with courtesy, dignity and respect. 
 For the court, for each other and for everyone involved. 
 A boy has been murdered. His family will be present at all times. 
 We don't need to compound their suffering. 
 I can't believe we have to be here until we give evidence. 
 It could be days. I'll go mad. 
 Are you listening to me? 
 She'll see you. 
 I decide when, where and for how long. 
 I'll pick you up from an agreed location. 
 I'll text you the details. 
 So she's been with you all along. 
 It won't be a long meeting and I'll be watching. 
 You don't control us. 
 No. 
 See you later, then. 
 All right? 
 I need you to do something for me. 
 Do what? 
 See, plenty of time. 
 Turning up in a plumber's van. 
 I'll get the garage to look at the car. Stop worrying about it. 
 Bloody hell. 
 It's all right. Don't worry about it. Just try to ignore them. 
 (reporters shouting) 
 The man in the dock, Joe Miller, killed Daniel Latimer. 
 Then he moved Danny's body to a nearby beach. 
 Forensic evidence places him at the murder scene. 
 Mr Miller surrendered to the police saying he was sick of hiding. 
 Mr Miller confessed to police. 
 The facts are clear and will enable you to convict Mr Miller of Daniel Latimer's murder. 
 Two proper coffees, petal, no foam. 
 Put your phone down for once, will you? 
 I'm just keeping the world informed. 
 About what's happening here? 
 Yeah. People care about you. 
 One way of getting justice. 
 It'll be fine in there, petal. 
 You'll do brilliantly. 
 Mum, they're asking for you. 
 OK. 
 When was the last time you saw your son alive? 
 I looked in on him around nine that night. 
 We'd all had tea together just after six. 
 Mark had gone out. 
 Me and Chloe were watching telly. Danny was in his bedroom. 
 Had music on. I told him he had till half nine then he had to go to bed. 
 And Danny gave no indication that he would be meeting anyone later in the night? 
 No. Nothing. 
 There was nothing to make me think, I... 
 I replay that moment every day. 
 Shutting the door on him, all the things I didn't ask. 
 How it would have been different if I'd been a better parent. 
 Thank you, Mrs Latimer. 
 Stay where you are, please. 
 As a mum myself, I know it must be difficult. I'll keep it short. 
 How was your marriage at the time of Danny's death? 
 Fine. 
 Had you or your husband ever had an affair? 
 What's that got to do with anything? 
 Can she ask that? 
 Yes, she can. 
 And the court needs you to answer. 
 My husband slept with Becca Fisher. 
 She owns the Traders Hotel. 
 Did Danny know about it? 
 Yes. I found out later that he did. 
 Did you ever hit Danny? 
 No. 
 Did your husband? 
 Mrs Latimer? 
 What's going on? 
 Who's on trial here? 
 You need to answer the question. 
 Is it not enough that my son was murdered by that man there and that I lost my mum three months back because she was broken by this? 
 Now I've got to stand here while you ask me about things that aren't connected. 
 Mrs Latimer, did your husband Mark ever hit Danny? 
 Once. It was only once. 
 Thank you. 
 No re-examination, My Lady. 
 Thank you, Mrs Latimer. You are released. 
 Has anyone noticed I'm not there? 
 They came over, I said you'd gone to the loo. 
 You won't be called for days. Are you there yet? 
 I'm not sure about this. 
 We have got one opportunity and we need to be all over it. 
 Why here? Why not in a hotel room or a park? 
 We need to control access front and back. 
 It has to be somewhere we know the layout. 
 It's a totally mutual location. 
 Not for me, it's not. 
 It's just, I've never been back in. 
 Detective Hardy. 
 Ohhhh. I'm being called. Bloody hell. I'll call when I'm done. 
 DI Hardy, you were the arresting officer. 
 Correct. 
 I'd like you to take us through the events of Mr Miller's arrest. 
 Where did the arrest take place? 
 At Mr Miller's house. 
 I love you, Miller. 
 You coerced Joe Miller into saying he killed Daniel Latimer, didn't you, DI Hardy? 
 No. I found him in the shed with the phone. 
 And he confessed, as I have recorded in my notes. 
 I suggest that Joe Miller found Daniel Latimer's phone and was about to report it to the police when you arrived alone and jumped to a false conclusion because it suited your purposes. 
 What purpose would that be? 
 You were under pressure. 
 You needed a result, didn't you? 
 There's always pressure to find a killer. 
 Hadn't you just been labelled Britain's worst cop by the national press? 
 One paper. 
 Are we letting the media judge this trial? 
 Or are we sticking to facts? 
 Stick with the events of the arrest, Miss Bishop. 
 Absolutely. 
 Let's move to the station. 
 When was a doctor called for Mr Miller? 
 I believe it was around 2:15pm. 
 Why did you call a doctor? 
 Mr Miller had sustained an injury. 
 Injuries, plural. 
 He sustained a broken rib and bruising to the neck, chest and torso. Correct? 
 Yes. 
 How did he get these injuries? 
 DI Hardy, how did the defendant sustain injuries while in custody at Broadchurch police station? 
 After DS Miller learned of her husband, the defendant's, confession, she asked to see him. 
 Against allowed procedure. 
 Yes. 
 Who allowed this visit? 
 I did. 
 I supervised, along with two other officers. 
 What happened? 
 DS Miller attacked the defendant. 
 She kicked the living daylights out of him, didn't she? 
 And you - you just stood there and watched, didn't you? 
 No. As soon as she started attacking him, I called in other officers and they removed DS Miller. 
 It was my error. 
 It had been... a long and emotional investigation. 
 How many other times was the defendant beaten while in custody? 
 None. 
 Did you use violence against the defendant at the house in order to get him to make a confession? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Why should we believe you? 
 An officer who, by his own admission, stood by and watched as a colleague beat up a suspect. 
 No, that's not how it happened. 
 The defence applies to have the defendant's confession excluded pursuant to Section 76 and 78 of Pace. 
 The confession is on camera. 
 The injuries were sustained after he confessed. 
 We cannot discount the possibility that the injuries were sustained before his arrival at the police station. 
 I agree with the defence. 
 I am minded to exclude the confession from evidence. 
 Members of the jury, you are to disregard it entirely. 
 All right. Thanks. 
 Well, what happened? 
 The confession's been excluded. 
 Sorry, Miller. 
 Right. 
 It's done. It's gone. 
 Nothing to be done. Try not to think about it. 
 You go fetch Claire. 
 Go on. 
 Ta. 
 (mobile vibrates) 
 Do you tell Mrs Latimer we meet? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 I don't know. 
 Why did you suggest it, then? 
 Maybe it's cos I think that... if it was the other way round and Dan had been left behind... I'd want someone looking out for him. You know? 
 Part of me feels that it's my fault. 
 What happened to Dan and what happened to all of us. 
 Just feel like I'm responsible. 
 You know? 
 And I can see it in everyone's faces when they look at me. Everyone's. 
 All the time. 
 I'm trying to make it better. But... but I know I never can. You know? 
 Alec'll be in the kitchen and I'll be by the front door. 
 If you're OK with that. 
 Sounds good. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 I've got a bit of butterflies, actually. 
 Really? 
 It's all right. He would never do anything to harm me. 
 He's never been rough with me. 
 Not unless I've asked. 
 So, where is she? 
 This way. 
 Beth. 
 Nige. How many times? You can't just come in like that. 
 I've just seen Ellie. She's back in her house. 
 What? 
 This way. 
 Give me your coat. 
 (laughs) 
 I'll keep the coat. 
 Do you wanna pat me down as well? 
 Yeah, if you're offering. 
 You haven't made her wear a wire or anything, have you? 
 No. 
 Front room. 
 We're coming in. 
 OK. 
 You all right? 
 Mm. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. 
 First door on the right. 
 OK. She's in. 
 I'll be in the kitchen. Miller will be by the front door. 
 You've got 15 minutes. 
 OK. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, God. I missed you. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. I thought I'd never see you again. 
 Has he made you record this? 
 No. 
 I promise. No wire. There's nothing. 
 "I'm in position. Outside." 
 I need to check. 
 Are you sure she's safe? 
 Course. I'm recording everything. 
 What? How? 
 Cameras. 
 You're bugging my house? Is that legal? You could have told me. 
 I'm telling you now. I'm not leaving them alone, am I? 
 Ellie. 
 Oh, God. 
 Do you know what happened in court today? 
 Beth, I'm sorry. 
 His whole confession gone because of you. 
 Miller, what's going on? 
 So what is this? You think you can move back? 
 Walk past my window like nothing's happened? 
 No. Listen. 
 Is this what you did to Joe? 
 Beth, don't push me. 
 Why not? I'm enjoying it. I'll do more than push you in a minute. 
 Beth, this isn't the time. 
 Please, don't do this. 
 You knew that if you beat him up, kick the sh1t out of him, it would give him a chance to get off. 
 God, no. 
 He's not gonna walk. He's guilty. We all know it. 
 Oh! Oh, sh1t. 
 Claire! 
 Oh, Beth, your waters. 
 See what you've done. 
 sh1t. sh1t! 
 Will you get away from me?! 
 Where is he?
