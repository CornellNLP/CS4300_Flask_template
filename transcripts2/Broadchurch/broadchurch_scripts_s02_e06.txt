 'Previously on Broadchurch.' 
 She says she forgives you... about the pendant. 
 Why would I kill a 12-year-old girl? 
 Why was her pendant found in your vehicle? 
 My DS was taking that bagged evidence... back to HQ. 
 And... her car was broken into. 
 There's grounds for reopening the case. 
 Don't do this. 
 Oh, God. You're his wife. 
 I can't go on meeting you here, mate. People will start getting the wrong idea. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I want to give evidence. 
 You want me to go in the witness box, don't you? 
 Honestly? I'm torn. 
 You said yourself, somebody needs to speak up for Dan. Well... 
 I'm his dad. It should be down to me, you know? 
 Thorp AgriServices. What is it they do? 
 Services to the agricultural industries. 
 Oh, God, it's a furnace. 
 Do you still think Lisa Newbery's alive? 
 There's a narrow lane about 500 yards in that direction. 
 This footpath and the lane were both examined by Forensics for tyre tracks and footmarks, but they never got anything useful. 
 It's a long way to carry a body without being noticed. 
 This stretch was never used much, even by the dog walkers. 
 So the killer had enough local knowledge to realise the chances of being spotted were low. 
 Other access points are through those woods there. 
 What time's Tom due in the box? 
 Why have they called Tom? 
 Son's love for a father - that sort of thing, I expect. 
 We could have got back in time. 
 Tom said if I was there he'd ask from the witness box for me to be removed. 
 God, I'm sorry. 
 Are you all right? 
 I walked through here just before I found Pippa. 
 So how far are we from where the Gillespies live? 
 Er... Just over three miles. 
 And you think Pippa's body could have been brought through here? 
 That's what I always thought but it was impossible to know. 
 It was spring so this whole area was covered in bluebells. 
 And Claire Ripley's being sent bluebells through the post. 
 Or she's sending them to herself. 
 Hiding it in a wardrobe in a guest room, where it might be found. 
 Why would she do that? 
 To screw around with us. 
 It's what they all do - her and Ashworth, even the Gillespies. 
 I don't think any one of them told the whole truth. 
 The stress they've put you under, do it to them and start with Claire. 
 (MOBILE BEEPS) 
 It's from Lucy. Tom's going in the witness box. 
 Bishop : Do you get along with your dad, Tom? 
 I love him. 
 Has he ever made you do anything that made you feel uncomfortable? 
 No. 
 Were you aware of any contact between Danny and your dad? 
 No. Danny was my friend, not his. 
 The day Danny's body was found, how did your dad behave? 
 Normally. 
 I got home from school and he made me tea. 
 How was he the days after? 
 He was upset... like we all were. 
 Now, how did you get to know Susan Wright? 
 Erm... 
 Right, I met her in the arcade. 
 I liked her dog, Vince. 
 She let me visit her caravan. 
 Have you ever met anyone else in that caravan? 
 (Beth, listen.) 
 Yes. 
 Danny's dad, Mark. 
 What's he talking about? 
 Nothing. 
 (Why didn't Mark tell us about that?) 
 He said that... we could meet and other people don't have to know. 
 What did you do with Mark? 
 We played FIFA on the PlayStation. 
 Did you ever talk about Danny? 
 Yes. 
 He said he was guilty. 
 Guilty of what? 
 He said... 
 Danny's death was his fault. 
 (What?!) 
 That's where you were all those times I was calling. 
 It made me feel close to Dan. 
 (I'm sorry.) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) 
 It doesn't help me if I don't know these things. 
 I never thought it would be a part of this. I'm sorry. 
 Everything's a part of it, Mark. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Try and take Tom Miller apart... kindly, precisely, so... the jury don't hate me... or you. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Hello? 
 It's me. 
 I think we are done. 
 What? 
 I was protecting you from Lee, you don't want that any more. 
 You keep changing your story about what happened. This isn't working, I need you to move out. 
 Alec, where are you? Let's talk about this face-to-face. 
 No, I'm giving you 48 hours. 
 What's going on? You can't do that! 
 I can. It's over, Claire. OK? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 sh1t! sh1t! sh1t! 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Tom, you know, don't you, that when someone is found guilty of murder they go to prison for a number of years? 
 Yes. 
 You love your dad very much, don't you? 
 He's a great dad. 
 But you know that telling lies, even to protect someone you love, is wrong? 
 I'm not lying for my dad. 
 Tom, I'm suggesting that that's exactly what you are doing. 
 No. 
 Mark Latimer didn't say he killed Danny, did he? 
 He said he was guilty. 
 Did he say he 'was' guilty or he 'felt' guilty? 
 There's a big difference. 
 My dad wouldn't have killed Danny. 
 So let me ask you... has every single word you've said to this court been absolutely, 100% true? 
 Tom? 
 I think so. 
 I'm sorry, 'I think so' isn't good enough. 
 The court needs you to be certain. 
 This isn't about your dad. This is about your friend Danny. 
 Because Danny can't speak up for himself any more. 
 So our job is to find out what Danny would say if he was here. 
 You see that, don't you, Tom? 
 Yes. 
 We all want justice for Danny. 
 So let me ask you again. 
 Has every word you've said here been 100% true? 
 Did Mark Latimer say he 'was' guilty? 
 No. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Thank you, Tom. 
 I want the details of the stalker that was seen around the estate in the weeks before the girls disappeared. 
 And against my better judgement I put all the statements - four sightings in the week before - on here. 
 Thank you. 
 Plus all CCTV collected from the case. 
 And there's a company - Thorp AgriServices. 
 If we could send a forensics team - 
 Uh-uh. Stop. 
 No forensics teams, nothing official. I'm pushing as it is. 
 Do not drop me in it. 
 Erm... I'm going into hospital tomorrow - pacemaker. 
 Bloody hell. 
 Are you all right with that? 
 If anything happens, I've made a will. 
 You are worried. 
 Have you told Daisy? 
 Phew! 
 Well erm... good luck. 
 I miss you, Tess. 
 Oh, Alec, please... 
 I wish we could go back, still be a family. 
 Right, these are the accounts for the last seven years. 
 Oh, do you remember ever doing any work for a company called Thorp AgriServices? 
 I don't think so. 
 I'm surprised you remember anything, the amount of that you put away. 
 Are you still here? 
 Oh, that's a beautiful picture. 
 It's my favourite one of her. 
 And that pendant, is that the one that was found in Ashworth's car - the missing bit of evidence? 
 Yeah. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 The side gate was open. Sorry, I got a bit delayed. 
 Ah. Don't worry, I was just about to... go outside anyway. 
 No texts, Lucy's not answering her phone, and Olly's not tweeting court updates. 
 Well, maybe the court's still sitting. 
 I need to get back. 
 I need to know what's happened. 
 Did you ask Cate about Thorp AgriServices? 
 Yeah, she denied all knowledge. 
 What are you doing? 
 Ah. 
 Do all the gardens have those? 
 No, it was put in by Lee Ashworth. 
 With Ricky and Cate's approval. Why did they never have it removed? 
 It's for kids to go in and out of each other's gardens, not grown-ups. 
 Lee and Claire didn't have any kids. Why have they got that? 
 Are you all right? What are you doing? 
 Has he told you what he's done?! 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, right. So he's sent you along, has he? 
 His pet, Ellie. 
 I just came to see how you were doing. 
 I put my life in his hands and he dragged me here to this shithole - hid me away! 
 I put my trust in him. I've done nothing wrong and he just drops me like that. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Can I come and live with you? 
 That wouldn't work - I live in a tiny little studio flat near the station in Devon. 
 What about your house in town? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 I don't want you living there. 
 I thought we were friends. 
 Really? 
 I think you've been playing all of us. 
 Why would I do that? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, I haven't done that. I swear, I have not done that. 
 And he's just jealous because I've slept with Lee. 
 Why would he be jealous? 
 Angry, OK? I meant angry. 
 Look, either you want protecting from Lee or you don't. 
 You can't have it both ways. 
 I said, when I see him, I just lose myself. 
 It's... it's the s*x, Ellie. 
 It's just... something happens when we're together. 
 Oh, please. Have a little self-control. 
 Look, if you want to be my friend, you tell me everything - the truth, past and present - and then maybe I'll have a little word with with Hardy about you. 
 Fine. 
 I will. You come over and we'll talk. And maybe I can do your hair. 
 What? 
 Well, it's... I-I haven't done anybody's hair in a long time. 
 Please? 
 All right. 
 I told Chlo to stay home with Lizzie today. 
 Maybe you shouldn't come either. 
 Nice try. I'm coming. 
 Tell the truth up there. We can't have another witness unravel. 
 Now, what I want from you is an exact written timeline of who was where when my son was beaten up. 
 I want to know the names of officers and supervisors on duty so I can make a specific disciplinary complaint. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 It's not gonna take any longer than that because I'm not gonna be off your back until I know that he is on his way somewhere safe. 
 And don't try and piss me about, because I am relentless. 
 You've got 60 minutes. 
 (Prick.) 
 Morning! 
 Hi. 
 They're doing it. Mark Latimer is going in the box. 
 Good. 
 Good? 
 This is what you've been aiming for, isn't it? 
 Clerk : Do you wish to swear or affirm? 
 Mark : Affirm. 
 Please read the card. 
 'I do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that the evidence I shall give... shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.' 
 (What the living f*ck.) 
 Are you sure you want to be here today? 
 I want to know what's being said about me. 
 Mr Latimer, how well do you know Nigel Carter? 
 Very well. He's worked with me four years now. 
 Do you trust him? 
 With my life. 
 And my son's life. 
 So what do you say to the accusation that Susan Wright saw Nigel Carter carrying your son's body the night of his death? 
 She's obviously got two bald blokes mixed up, cos it wasn't Nige. 
 Since Danny's death, have you been meeting Tom Miller? 
 Yeah, I have. 
 I was trying to help him through this. 
 But I should have thought it through a bit more. It... 
 It looks a bit odd. 
 Did you tell Tom Miller... that you were guilty of killing your son? 
 No. 
 I said I 'felt' guilty... because I wasn't there for Dan. 
 Where were you on the night of your son's death, Mr Latimer? 
 I was with Becca Fisher - the owner of the Traders Hotel. 
 Were you having an affair? 
 No. 
 It was the first time anything had... happened. 
 Did you have s*x that night? 
 Yes. 
 Where? 
 In her car. 
 Then what did you do? 
 Then she drove me back to the cliff-top car park. 
 I picked up my car and... we went our separate ways. 
 And did you go home immediately? 
 No, it was... about an hour, an hour and a half later. 
 Where did you go during that time? 
 Mr Latimer, where were you? 
 I drove through the vale. 
 And I parked up on the hill. 
 And I started writing this - I dunno - note, letter. 
 A letter to whom? 
 To Beth, my wife. 
 Why would you be writing a letter to your wife at that time of the morning? 
 I was saying it was over. 
 That I'd met someone else, that our marriage was done. 
 I'd gone a bit mad. I was like... like a kid of 14, giddy with a fling. I'm not proud. 
 (SOBS AND SCREAMS) 
 Come on, Beth. Come here. 
 Beth, come on. Come here. 
 Come here. It's all right. It's all right. 
 It's not Mark. This is not Mark. This is Joe doing this to us. 
 We won't let him win, OK? 
 Why are we waiting here anyway? 
 Just hang on for one minute. 
 Now, Ell, before you say anything - 
 I don't want to talk to you. 
 Sit down. 
 Sit down! 
 Do you see what you put Mark and Beth through?! 
 He wouldn't be up there if it wasn't for you. 
 I know you want to protect your father but he is a murderer and a sh1t and he deserves none of your feelings for him. 
 Look what you ended up doing! 
 You lied, on oath, in a court of law and I hope you're ashamed! 
 Are you? ARE YOU?! 
 Yes. Yes, Mum. 
 You are coming home with me tonight back to the house. 
 No, we're not cos - 
 Yes we are because I am your bloody mother! 
 If I have to drag you kicking and screaming, I will! 
 Your father has done enough damage and I will not let him destroy us! 
 Do you understand?! 
 Yes, Mum. 
 Right, that's... good. 
 It's quite a coincidence that neither you nor Nigel Carter have an alibi for around the time of your son's death, isn't it? 
 That's the way it was. 
 You admit that you were at the car park next to the cliff-top hut around the time your son was killed? 
 I was, yeah. 
 What's the distance between the car park and the hut? 
 I don't know, 50 yards. 
 You were 50 yards away from where your son was killed. 
 Yes. 
 At almost exactly the time he was killed. 
 Yeah. 
 So, from the hut, it's possible that Danny could have seen you with Becca Fisher that night? 
 You need to answer, Mr Latimer. 
 It's possible, yeah. 
 Isn't it true... that because Danny saw you with Becca that night - 
 I said it was possible, not that it happened. 
 .. that you strangled him in that cliff-top hut - 
 No. 
 .. and then called your mate and colleague Nige Carter to dispose of the body - 
 None of that happened. 
 .. who was then seen by Susan Wright. 
 Not true! None of that is true! 
 And then you arrange these strange meetings with Tom Miller because you felt guilty that his father was taking the blame. 
 I did not kill my son! 
 How did you get in to see Joe Miller while he was in police custody? 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 Did you bribe a police officer? 
 My Lady, this has no relevance to the evidence Mr Latimer can give. 
 It's fantastically relevant, My Lady. 
 You can wait, Miss Knight. 
 How did you get into the cells, Mr Latimer? 
 The custody sergeant was an old friend. He let me in. 
 Did you go there to threaten Mr Miller to be silent? 
 Or to gloat that he was taking the blame for a murder you'd committed? 
 No, it was nothing like that. 
 My Lady, I'd like to raise a point of law. 
 I'm sure you would, Miss Bishop. 
 Members of the jury, would you step out, please? 
 Tell me we didn't know any of this! 
 It's not in any statement, any disclosure. 
 Mark just didn't tell us. 
 
 
 
 (HEART MONITOR BEEPS) 
 Bishop : The investigating officers in this case have breached the PACE codes of practice time and time again. 
 This is a fundamentally flawed investigation, littered with errors. 
 The defence applies for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that there has been an abuse of the court's process - such that the defendant cannot have a fair trial. 
 My Lady, I'm asking you to dismiss this case. 
 (HEART MONITOR BEEPS) 
 (COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS) 
 (HEART MONITOR FLATLINES) 
 (SILENCE) 
 Claire : (distantly) 'Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! 
 Wake up! Wake up!' 
 'Wake up! Wake up!' 
 (I'm alive.) 
 Judge : I'll hear your submission now, Miss Knight. 
 I'd ask for an adjournment while we obtain statements from the relevant officers. 
 Only then can I address whether there has been an abuse which prejudices this trial. 
 All right. You have your adjournment, Miss Knight. 
 Talk to the officers concerned and I'll hear full arguments on it before ruling. 
 Thank you, my Lady. 
 (MOBILE BUZZES) 
 What? 
 A text? 
 Don't start, Miller. 
 You sneak off and send me a text, knowing my phone won't be on in the courtroom. 
 I'll give you money to shut up. 
 I'll give you more money to be less of a knob. 
 I made it. I made it through! 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 (GROANS) You'd only come and sit with me. 
 What is wrong with you?! 
 I do need a lift home later, though. 
 I can't. 
 I'm picking Fred up from Lucy's and I'm bringing Tom home. 
 I can drive him. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Suddenly had a thought you might die, I felt I had to drive down and see you. 
 I've got this. 
 Right, OK. 
 I've spoken to the doctors. 
 They recommend you stay in. 
 Take me home. 
 Why is he throwing you out? 
 Because of you. Because you came round and we had s*x there. 
 Yeah, and you told him. 
 Mm-hm. 
 And what else have you been talking about? 
 No, we need to make a plan. 
 We had a plan... and you screwed it. 
 Oh, you want to talk about screwing, do you? Huh? 
 (GASPS) 
 Well, go on! 
 Go on. 
 What are you gonna do, Lee? What are you gonna do? 
 Do you want to strangle me? Do you want to punch me? 
 Do you want to...? 
 I had to go and see Joe. I had to look him in the eye. 
 I wasn't thinking about the future, Beth, I was thinking about what he'd done to Dan. 
 How is this a marriage? 
 You share nothing. 
 You keep everything locked away from me. 
 Not from you. It's not about you. 
 Why isn't it about me?! 
 Why can't you make it about me, just for once? 
 Why are we together, Mark? Is it just because Danny died? 
 No. 
 Because if it is, don't bother. 
 I don't need you. I could do without you. 
 Don't talk to me like that. 
 Are you gonna write me a letter? 
 It's better than your endless talking about it and nothing changing! 
 If you're gonna stay, sort yourself out. Tell me everything or piss off. 
 And, by the way, if this trial collapses now it's because of you. 
 I'm not myself when I'm with you. 
 I was worried when she wouldn't put me in the witness box, but... now I see what her plan was. 
 What do you reckon? 
 Do you think they'll dismiss it? 
 Do you think... Do you think I'm winning? 
 You're guilty, Joe. 
 I thought you were on my side. 
 And I thought I could help you come to terms with what you've done. 
 But... I don't see you taking responsibility for your actions. 
 How do you think God would view that? 
 When I was a paramedic... 
 I saved a lot of lives. 
 God sees that. 
 He knows the good I've done. 
 It doesn't work like that. 
 You watched your son lie for you... on oath, and still you're trying to wriggle free. 
 I'm done with these visits. 
 Goodbye, Joe. 
 Paul? 
 Paul, don't walk away. 
 Paul? 
 All right, wiggy? 
 Still after that profile piece? 
 'Woman beneath the wig: next legal hotshot.' 
 Hey? How am I doing? 
 Can you stop flirting with me? 
 I'm from London - I know what you're doing. 
 Oh, right. OK. 
 Can you afford to buy me dinner? 
 Knight : So, tell me again. 
 I spoke to the officer concerned. He did let Mark in but Mark spoke to Joe through the wicket only. 
 Said he'd known the Latimers for 15 years. 
 So now he'll be suspended of duties, pending an investigation. 
 Right, clear some space. 
 Well, move all these papers. Come on. 
 It's only carbonara... but it's better than nothing. 
 It's great. 
 Sorry, why are you cooking for us again? 
 Ha! Has she ever offered you any food the whole time you've worked with her? 
 No. 
 Ha! See? 
 I have. 
 You have not. 
 Well, what about those Jaffa Cakes that time? 
 I bought those. 
 Did you? 
 You never change. 
 That's a good thing. 
 Now, Ben... 
 Jocelyn's got something to tell you. 
 Have I? 
 Have you? 
 Yes, she has. 
 Something she's been meaning to say for a while, in confidence. 
 Tell him. 
 You only cooked so you could corner me. 
 Absolutely. 
 Get on with it. 
 My sight's failing. 
 I'm going blind. 
 What? 
 I have macular degeneration. 
 It started at the centre of my vision, like a... small... black hole. 
 At the beginning I... 
 I didn't think it was so serious but it's steadily getting worse. 
 Which is why... 
 I need you to read and... to record everything. 
 Which is why I stopped taking cases. 
 Well, until this one. 
 Are you... getting treatment? 
 Mm. I have injections, which keeps it at bay. 
 For now. 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 Well, don't be. I mean, the body lets down the mind, the mind lets down the body. 
 It comes to us all. 
 Are you fit enough to keep going with the case? 
 Yes. I am. 
 And don't you dare suggest otherwise. 
 I need this, Ben. 
 Eat your carbonara. 
 And you, stop looking so smug. 
 You're welcome. 
 Right. Well, this is you. 
 Mm-hm. 
 They've got nice rooms here, haven't they? 
 OK, Olly, what I'm about to say - it's not about you, it's about me. 
 Oh, right. 
 It's just I haven't had s*x in ages and I really feel like I've earned it. 
 Oh, right. 
 Where do you live? 
 Because I cannot have my boss finding out about this. 
 Er... 
 That way. 
 OK. Come on, then. 
 I can't be long, I'm picking up Tom again. Taking him home, finally. 
 You must be relieved about that. 
 Yeah. 
 Him, me and Fred - home together. 
 Me and Lee are looking at a house later. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Why wouldn't we? 
 So you kept your hairdressing stuff, then? 
 Oh, yeah. That's my magic bag. 
 Even when I had to leave with Alec, it was the first thing I packed. 
 Got my portfolio, everything still in it. 
 Really? Can I see? 
 Yeah, have a look. 
 Ooh. 
 Look at you! Nice. 
 I scrub up well, don't I? 
 We were back there the other day, near your old house. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I saw the river where they found Pippa, walked through the woods. 
 I spoke to Cate. 
 Is she still drinking? 
 A bit, yeah. 
 I assumed that was since the deaths, but was she always like that? 
 I don't want to speak ill of her - not after everything she's been through - but she always had a posh glass of wine in her hand. Made sure you knew it was expensive. 
 Right. 
 Maybe it was because we were renting off them, but I just... always felt she was looking down on us. 
 Well, me. Lee she just flirted with, but everybody flirts with Lee and he just flirts right back, so... 
 You don't think... 
 Did they ever have a thing? 
 I hate her. 
 Sorry, but I do. 
 He was never interested in her. He's never looking to go older. 
 Younger, maybe, but not Cate's age. 
 Right, nearly finished! (clears throat) 
 Thanks. 
 Come on. 
 Right. Get some old clothes on. 
 What for? 
 First order of business, we're gonna paint the bedroom where me and your dad used to sleep. 
 I don't know how to paint. 
 Well, tonight's the night you'll learn. 
 We're gonna do the whole house eventually. 
 This is ours, Tom. 
 You, me and Fred. 
 OK, just take it slow. Where are we going? 
 It's just here. 
 This is where you live? 
 Don't start. 
 Bloody hell, Alec. 
 It's very quiet but it's only a six or seven-minute walk into town. 
 A five-minute walk to the beach. Lovely area, great schools. 
 We can't do this. 
 Then what do we do? 
 Are you warm enough? 
 Right, two of these. 
 Why did you come? 
 Honestly? 
 I thought if you had died and I never said that... 
 When the pendant was stolen from my car - 
 When you were shagging Dave while we were still married. 
 You took the blame. 
 You covered for me, just so I wouldn't get the rap. 
 You're a good man, Alec. 
 They would have ruined your career. 
 I got away with mine... just. 
 I just wanted you to know I loved you for that. 
 But not enough. 
 Where are you staying tonight? 
 On your sofa? 
 Have you seen that sofa? 
 (MOBILE RINGS) 
 Oh, it's your daughter. 
 Hey, Daze. Yeah, I'm with him. 
 Pretty sh1t. 
 No, much worse than normal. 
 She wants to speak to you. 
 Do you need me to...? 
 Hi, darlin'. Fine. 
 No, just a little bit of metal. 
 It's the first step to being the Six Million Dollar Man. 
 What do you mean you've never heard of the Six Million... What do they teach you at that school? 
 Yeah, it's all fixed. 
 No more broken heart. 
 What? You are kidding! 
 Hi. 
 I don't want you in my house. 
 Well, bad luck. I'm shagging your son tonight. 
 Where is he? 
 Sleeping. Snoring, hence me awake. 
 Olly! 
 You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
 Oh, he's not that bad. 
 I mean, what you're doing to this town. 
 I'm just doing my job. 
 What, and you think Joe's gonna get off? 
 Do you think this whole trial's gonna be over tomorrow? 
 Hopefully, yeah. 
 I f*cking hate lawyers. 
 Olly! Olly, will you wake up and get this woman out of my house?! 
 (BABY LIZZIE CRYING) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 No evidence was compromised, no physical intimidation occurred. 
 We have a sworn statement from the officer who was present. 
 My Lady, it was an unfortunate incident but the process of justice can still flow. 
 This doesn't mean the defendant cannot have a fair trial. 
 There have clearly been failings in this investigation and in the conduct of officers, but I am satisfied that the defendant can indeed get a fair trial. 
 So I'm going to refuse the application. 
 Thank you, My Lady. 
 Bishop : I'm not losing to her, Abby. 
 We're gonna fight till the bitter end. 
 I think I might have something. 
 It could be juicy. 
 Well done! You got it back on track. 
 The power of a good carbonara. 
 Still a lot of work to do. Oh, by the way... 
 I got you both this. 
 Wonders will never cease! 
 Yeah, well, thank you very much!

 Hello? 
 It's Andrew Darlington from the care home. 
 Oh, I'm at work. Could you call back later? 
 Not really. Your mother had a fall. 
 I-I'm afraid she passed away. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Oh. 
 I was expecting him to answer. 
 He's asleep. 
 Listen, tell him the trial's still on. 
 But, also - and you need to know this, too - 
 Claire Ripley showed me a photograph. 
 She was wearing Pippa's pendant. 
 Can you get hold of it? 
 It's in her portfolio at the cottage. 
 Not here. Someone might see.
