 (GASPS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 What? 
 No. 
 What? Is that now? 
 Certainly is. 
 DI Hardy, you must be anticipating the relief today's court date'll bring. 
 It's the plea and case management hearing. 
 But you're pleased you got the right man in the dock? 
 What sort of a question is that? Pleased? Is that how you train him? 
 (PHONE) 
 Take it if you want. 
 Right - 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Today's hearing is the result of a thorough investigation by a team of dedicated officers who worked day and night under difficult circumstances. 
 And how will you personally feel seeing Joe Miller again? 
 No. Don't do that. It's not about me. 
 He's the husband of your old detective sergeant. You must want the same as us, Joe Miller sentenced for what he did. As soon as that happens, we can all move on. 
 You know I can't comment in advance of today. 
 Are you missing being on active duty as a detective? 
 You can probably stop taking the arsehole pills, Oliver. 
 I thought you might leave. 
 Now that you don't have any reason to be here. 
 All right... picture. 
 If you just stand there. 
 Here? Really? 
 Yeah. That cliff fall's recent. They're getting more frequent. 
 Things fall apart. 
 It'd help if you look up. 
 Smile! 
 (PHONE BUZZES) 
 OK. Perfect. 
 How's Tom getting on? 
 Me and Mum are trying to get him through it but he still doesn't want to be with Ellie... 
 Have you seen her? 
 You? 
 (SIREN) 
 I'm really sorry. I didn't realise- 
 You were speeding. 
 I've got a hospital appointment. 
 Biopsy results. My last meeting, it ran over. 
 Of course it did. 
 Look, here's my appointment card. 
 (Come on, give him a break.) 
 Licence, please. 
 Round here, we give people a chance. 
 Lord, give us the strength so that we may deal with this day of challenges. 
 Give us the wisdom so that we may choose the correct path. 
 And grant us compassion to understand the impact our actions have on others. 
 We stand now at a crossroads and ask that you guide us out of the darkness... and into light... in your forgiveness and mercy. 
 Guide us on the path to redemption, under your gaze... 
 Amen. 
 You need to go. 
 Do they know about you coming here? 
 No-one knows. 
 Be strong today, Joe. 
 Is it working? 
 Not exactly. 
 Pressure's not strong enough. 
 So, fix it. If this pool isn't full and I'm mid-contractions... 
 They got a pool at the hospital. 
 Don't you start. 
 I'm having an home birth, Nige. 
 All right, Nige. You get it going? 
 Not really. 
 Let's get you a top-class pump, eh? 
 Cheers. 
 Where've you been? 
 Just doing stuff. You know. 
 No. 
 We need to get going. Get changed, Chlo. 
 What's the thing to say? Good luck? 
 Mr Miller, Abby Thompson. 
 Yeah, I remember you. 
 Anything I need to know NOT covered by the case files? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 Once the plea is entered, you'll be remanded back into custody for sentence. 
 See you in a minute. 
 Do you have any comments on the case reopening? 
 (PHONE) 
 Can we get a picture, please? 
 Good morning. How are we? 
 It's a simple hearing. Once he's entered a plea, he'll be remanded for sentencing. 
 The judge will ask for psychiatric reports and we'll submit the victim impact statements. 
 The court's at the top of the stairs and I'll talk to you after. 
 OK. 
 You didn't have to be here today. 
 Oh, we did. 
 I need to hear him say it. 
 'All parties in Miller to court one. 
 All parties in Miller to court one.' 
 You're kidding me... 
 Just leave it, Beth. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry, Crown versus Miller? 
 Up the stairs. Courtroom one. 
 Sorry. 
 Miller. 
 I didn't think she'd have the nerve. 
 All right, Beth. 
 What? 
 Now let's just see this through, all right? 
 How's Devon? 
 Awful. 
 (Hiya.) 
 Er, members of the public this way, madam. Thank you. 
 Da-da-da-da-da. Out, now, come on. 
 What are you doing here? You know how important today is. 
 Sorry, I was worried you turned your phone off. 
 You cannot be here - 
 Sorry, I'm panicking, I didn't know what to do. 
 Go. 
 I think he's back and I think he's looking for me. 
 What? 
 No, he's not. He can't be. 
 I'd know. Why do you think that? 
 Nine missed calls on my phone. Number withheld. 
 That doesn't mean- 
 It's him. 
 It's not. You need to calm down. 
 I know where he is. I've had a trace on him. 
 He's not even in the country. 
 You'd better be sure, Alec, cos I feel like I can't breathe- 
 Everything is fine. Stay calm. Stop worrying. Soon as I'm done here, I'll come over. 
 Now, go home. Please. 
 It's all fine. 
 Maybe use the back exit. 
 Who was that? 
 All rise. 
 All parties in the case of Joseph Miller. 
 Don't you look at me. 
 Are you Joseph Michael Miller? 
 Yes. 
 Joseph Michael Miller, you are charged with murder contrary to common law. 
 The particulars of the offence are that on the 18th day of July 2013, you murdered Daniel Latimer of 4 Spring Close, Broadchurch, Dorset. 
 How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty? 
 Not guilty. 
 No. 
 He can't. 
 Er... Your Honour... 
 Sorry. Erm... Can I just ask for the indictment to be put again? 
 Be a man, Joe! You know what happened! 
 Sit down. 
 I said sit down. 
 I take it from your reaction, Ms Thompson, that Queen's Counsel have not been instructed. 
 Very much not, Your Honour. 
 Could you confirm your plea, Mr Miller? 
 Not least, it seems for the benefit of your own counsel. 
 Not guilty. 
 (TAPPING ON DOOR) 
 It's occupied! 
 I know. Come out, Miller. 
 Go away! It's the ladies! You can't come in! 
 You've been ages. 
 Oi! There's a sign. Cleaning in progress. Out! Out! 
 Don't let it get to you. 
 Oh, thanks for that. Brilliant advice. 
 God. You caught Joe... 
 He had Danny's phone, you brought him in, you interviewed him. He didn't resist. He is guilty. 
 And the case against him is strong. The CPS never had any doubt about prosecuting. 
 Doesn't he know what it's gonna do to Beth and Mark? To all of us? 
 Who will tell Tom? He's at school. If his friends find out before him... 
 I spoke to your sister. 
 She and Olly are going to take him out at lunchtime. 
 I could go with them. I could see him. 
 You know he doesn't want that. 
 I'm his mother. 
 He's only gonna blame me more. How am I ever gonna get him back if there's a trial? 
 How is this my life now? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Do you want a... hug? 
 What? No! 
 No. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 I want to help. 
 Hug it out? 
 People do that. 
 Well, not you. 
 Try not to be alone today. 
 I am alone, sir. 
 You don't have to call me sir any more. 
 I know. 
 (CLATTERING) 
 Christ's sake! Did you put that there? 
 Beth : So, what happens now? 
 It's a full trial, I'm afraid. 
 I don't believe this. 
 We need to make sure the CPS find you the best QC, which erm... might be tricky. 
 You CAN get us someone, can't you? 
 I know who you want but... you won't get her. 
 She hasn't taken a brief in such a long time. 
 She's the best there is, she lives locally, she's CPS approved... 
 I know who you mean. 
 So, how do we get her to say yes to us? 
 Did you not see me in here five minutes before you went into the dock? 
 Did we not have that conversation? 
 I know. I know. I'm sorry. 
 I'm here to represent you. That's the whole point. 
 You stitched me up. 
 Do you want to tell me what you're doing? 
 I've had a lot of time to think, OK? 
 I can't go to prison for Danny's death. 
 Find me someone to take my case. 
 Hey. I've been calling you. 
 Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry. 
 I just needed a bit of air, collect my thoughts. 
 Can you believe Joe? What the hell was he thinking? 
 I really have no idea. 
 Is everything OK? 
 Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm... I'm not gonna go straight back. 
 There's something I need to do. 
 OK, well, come over later. I'll get the kitchen to save you something. 
 Bloody hell! 
 Didn't I say? 
 20 quid, sunshine! 
 How have I not heard about that? 
 I think he could do better. 
 I dunno. 
 I think Becca's quite fit. I mean, I would. 
 What? Just the once. You know... to see. 
 Oliver! 
 Right, article done. 
 Ready to post online and... publish. 
 Sweet. 
 Olly! 
 What's so sweet about your uncle being on trial? What about Tom? 
 Yeah. No, obviously, poor kid. 
 We should go and pick him up. 
 I suppose today means I'll have to give evidence. 
 Why would you have to give evidence? 
 I dunno, just thought we all would. Are we going or not? 
 Hi. 
 You shouldn't have come earlier. 
 I know. It was stupid. 
 Yeah, it bloody was. Don't do that sort of thing. 
 People don't know you're here, for good reason. 
 I said I was sorry. 
 It's just I was spooked by those calls and I... I needed you. 
 We need to stick to what we agreed. 
 Promise me I'm safe, Alec. 
 I've told you. Everything's OK. 
 So, you're staying? 
 No, I've got things I need to do. 
 I don't like being here by myself. 
 Stop worrying. 
 You don't know what he's capable of. 
 I do. I've got it covered. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 It's boiling in here! You've got all the radiators on. It's the most gorgeous day. 
 Oh, for goodness' sake. 
 Stop it! Leave me alone, will you? 
 No. 
 Look at you, marinating in self pity. 
 I'm not marinating in anything. 
 I'm listening to a book. 
 You remember books? Hm? 
 Some of us can cope with more than 300 words at a time. 
 You've heard what's happened? To the Latimers? 
 Yes. 
 Are they all right? 
 Course they're not. 
 They've got to go through the indignity of a full trial. 
 What's he playing at? 
 I don't know but the family need help. 
 That's their barrister. Young chap. 
 No. 
 I haven't even said what I want to say - 
 I said no. Go away. 
 They're worried the CPS will fob them off with just anyone. 
 They're right to be worried but it's not my problem. 
 Jocelyn! 
 Don't, Maggie. I'm sure you've prepared a barnstorming little speech but you're getting on, save your energy. 
 Jocelyn, you know them. 
 Barely. 
 You know what it means to all of us. He can't get away with it. 
 Spare me the sentimental populism. I get enough of that from your rag. 
 Please! 
 No. 
 Why? 
 (SIGHS) 
 You know why. 
 We'd find you a team to help. 
 You can't just sit here. The Latimers need you. 
 Enough violins now. The answer is no. 
 Don't bother to close the curtains and I'm moving the key. 
 Your dad has let all this paperwork stack up. I can't concentrate. 
 All I keep thinking of is Joe Miller. 
 It should be over - 
 I know. 
 But we all promised each other we don't let him get to us. 
 Right. What needs doing? Get your fat belly out the way and let me help. 
 Oh, I know. Look at me, Chlo. 
 I am so bloody big. I wish it would just come. 
 It's stubborn like the rest of us. 
 This one... 
 It won't replace Danny. 
 Yeah. I know that. 
 (PHONE) 
 Nige, you all right? 
 Hi, lovely, is Mark with you? 
 He's with you, isn't he? 
 Right, yeah, must be running late then. 
 He left hours ago. You not seen him? 
 Well, no, most likely he's working on a job that I've forgotten about. 
 Let me try him on his mobile. 
 No, erm... I've already given that a go so don't worry. 
 'Beth?' 
 Beth? 
 'You've reached Mark Latimer. Leave a message after the beep.' 
 Three days ago? Lee Ashworth enters the country three days ago and you're telling me now? 
 Have you any - 
 What is the point of you, Craig? 
 God's sake! 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 (VEHICLE HORNS) 
 (PHONE) 
 Yeah, sorry, I'm two minutes away. 
 Unbelievable. Three hours there, three hours back, working all the way, late night studying in the worst budget hotel yet, and then, this bloke changes his plea to not guilty, in the dock. 
 Do we need milk? 
 Out with the old. 
 Are you actually tidying? 
 You'll know. Where in God's name are the teabags? 
 Ran out two days after our clerk resigned. 
 He didn't resign, I fired him. 
 Sharon, he cc'd me into his resignation email. 
 So, you knew about the teabags and you still came back without any? 
 I'm your junior, not your office girl. 
 That Dorset murder. Boy on the beach last summer. 
 That's the bloke who changed his plea in the dock. Needs a QC. 
 Nah, not interested. 
 Read the file. 
 London? 
 West Country. 
 West Country? 
 It'll have profile. 
 I don't want profile. 
 Just look at it. 
 Don't want to. 
 Our clerk resigned. What other cases have we got? 
 We're waiting for the right thing. 
 This IS the right thing. I looked through the file on the way up on the train. 
 There are discrepancies. 
 What sort of discrepancies? 
 Your sort. 
 I marked them in the file. If you look at THAT... 
 The procedure around that and the second paragraph of that... 
 Prosecution looks shaky. 
 If you defend this, then it shows people that nothing's been affected by, you know... 
 No, I don't know. 
 I'll get tea bags. 
 
 
 
 Ellie : How do I feel? 
 Julie : About Joe. 
 Do you mean, do I still fantasise about beating him with a hammer until he's dead? 
 And do I still daydream about that while I'm making toast? 
 And thinking how often I'd hit him before wiping the blood and the brains off the hammer... 
 Then do I worry if those thoughts make me the same as him? 
 Not as often, no. 
 And after being in court? 
 I was doing all right, you know. I was pressing it down, burying it... 
 Cos I taught myself to do that, these past few months, so I could survive and then in the court... seeing him and... him choosing to... 
 Cos I thought... OK, naive but I thought he'd plead guilty, he'd get sentenced and then it'd be done and then in a few weeks, or a month, I could go back to my home, to Broadchurch and... I could cope with all the glances and the stares cos justice would have been done and he wouldn't be coming back. 
 And then maybe in time, Tom would want to come and live with me again... and we could work that out... 
 It all seems a long way away now. 
 And how are you feeling about that? 
 Guilty. 
 Why? 
 Because it's my fault. 
 Joe : Have you seen Ellie? How's she doing? 
 What are you playing at, Joe? 
 You're upset I didn't warn you. 
 I came when you asked for me. I gave you guidance. 
 I've prayed with you because I... 
 I thought that you were penitent. 
 I know and I'm grateful. 
 Joe, you can't put everyone through a trial. 
 You confessed. The evidence against you is clear. 
 Not just me. Everyone. 
 Joe, you are the only one on trial here. 
 You killed a child. 
 Just you. No-one else. 
 Nobody's innocent, Paul. Everyone's hiding things. 
 Miller. 
 Go away! What are you doing here? 
 It's your appointment. 
 But I didn't tell anyone. 
 Have you been following me? 
 Shut up! 
 That's right. Stalk me and insult me and you wonder why you're divorced. 
 I'm in trouble. 
 So am I, if I don't collect Fred from the child minder's. 
 Seriously. 
 I sort of need your help. 
 Get in. For God's sake! 
 This needs to stay between us. You need to promise me. 
 How long's this gonna take? 
 Promise me. 
 Am I going to be annoyed by this? 
 Next left. 
 (CAR ENGINE) 
 What's going on? Who's this? 
 Miller, Claire. 
 Ellie. Hi. 
 Why are you bringing someone here? 
 She'll help. 
 No-one's supposed to know. 
 You're worried. She'll look after you. 
 Both : What? 
 Let's not do this out here. Inside. 
 Jocelyn? 
 I'm Beth Latimer. This is Mark. 
 Hi. 
 Maggie bloody Radcliffe! 
 We just need your help. 
 Joe Miller has to be convicted. We're not leaving that to chance. 
 I'm not practising. I haven't tried a criminal case in... in three years and I'm NOT taking your case. 
 Yeah but you know this town. 
 All the people who were affected, not just us. 
 How do they carry on if bloody Joe Miller gets off? If he comes back to live here? 
 It's not my responsibility. 
 You're right, it's not but we don't know who else to ask. 
 And see, me and him, we're different. I don't care about this town. I care about Danny. 
 And about this baby that I'm about to drop cos I can't give myself to another child, when I failed the last one. 
 You didn't fail him. 
 I did! We did! 
 Please stop saying that. 
 We have to get justice. 
 You have to help us. 
 I stopped working years ago. I'm not the person you've heard of. Just... 
 Just leave me alone. 
 He's gorgeous! 
 He's quite sleepy. 
 What is he? Two? 
 Nearly. You got kids? 
 Oh. 
 Sorry. Is she your wife? 
 Him? Please! 
 Not my wife. 
 Do you want to tell me what's going on? 
 I trust her. 
 She can help. 
 Go on, then. Tell her. You obviously want to. 
 It's sort of witness protection. 
 What? How can you be running witness protection? 
 I said, sort of, not officially. 
 But she is under my care. 
 What do you mean 'not officially'? You've been hiding her here? 
 No-one knows and no-one can know. 
 Are you out of your head? Oh, tell me you haven't done this. 
 A witness to what, that you have to be holed up here? 
 Tell her. 
 My last case before I came to Broadchurch. 
 Sandbrook. 
 There were two girls, cousins. 
 Lisa Newbery, 19, was babysitting for her 12-year-old cousin Pippa. 
 Pippa's parents went away for the night to a friend's wedding. 
 When they came back the next day, both girls were gone. 
 The 12-year-old, Pippa, her body was found three days later. 
 The 19-year-old, Lisa... 
 Officially she's still missing. 
 Our main suspect was a man called Lee Ashworth but he had a solid alibi. 
 Which was what? 
 Me. 
 I said I was with Lee all night. 
 Was that true? 
 No. 
 No, I was at a friend's house but Alec worked out that I was lying and he promised, if I told the truth, Lee would be convicted. 
 It was a big risk for me. 
 Why? 
 Lee's my husband. 
 Oh, God! 
 Yeah. 
 The trial collapsed and Lee walked a free man and I asked Alec if he would protect me. 
 So, that's what this place is all about. You can't just keep her here. 
 There are official channels, procedure. 
 Not if you've accused the person who's walked free. There's no witness protection, there's nothing. 
 I'd be abandoned if it wasn't for Alec. 
 How long have you been here? 
 Seven months or so? 
 No. If you've been here seven months... 
 When I came to Broadchurch. 
 That's WHY I came to Broadchurch. 
 I took the job so I could keep Claire safe here. 
 You w*nk*r! 
 No, Miller, don't! 
 That went well. 
 Fred, darling, we're going. 
 Miller, stop! 
 You took the job earmarked for me because of her. 
 Get over the bloody job! 
 Do you not see how stupid you're being? What are you thinking? 
 (I've got a plan.) 
 Yeah, well, it's sh1t! 
 I can solve Sandbrook. 
 Claire's the key. 
 What if Lee Ashworth comes looking for her? 
 (I want him to.) 
 That's your plan? 
 Just stay a bit longer, get to know Claire. 
 Have dinner, have some drinks, you can all stay the night. 
 Oh, have a sleepover! 
 She needs someone like you and you're not overloaded for friends. 
 Thanks a lot! 
 There's even room here for... 
 Fred! 
 Fred. Please, Miller. 
 Please, listen, I need to know I got Sandbrook right in the end. 
 I can't do it on my own. 
 So, Mr Miller... 
 Joe. 
 Thanks for coming. There's a lot I need to tell you. 
 No. What you need to do is shut up. 
 Sorry? 
 I'm looking at these transcripts and your interview and you've done far too much talking already. 
 As your new counsel, my advice is: don't talk to anyone, don't discuss the case, keep your mouth shut. 
 Understand? 
 You can open your mouth to say yes. 
 Yes. 
 I can't spend the rest of my life in prison, not as a child killer. 
 Promise me you can get me out of this. 
 I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could. 
 Now, a few questions to start us off, get things straight. 
 When you were arrested by DI Hardy, was he alone? 
 Did he have other officers with him? 
 He was alone. 
 And how did he take you into custody? 
 He called for a car. 
 And you waited for the car? 
 Just you and him? Did you talk to him then? 
 Yes. 
 Did he record the conversation? 
 No. 
 Now, your wife worked alongside DI Hardy. 
 Had you met him outside of work? 
 He'd been round for dinner. 
 Shall I try him again? 
 I'll do it. You start. 
 Hey... We're eating. 
 I thought you said you'd be back. 
 Hope everything's all right. 
 Let me know. 
 I'm sure he's fine. 
 Yeah. 
 What, does he not like being at home now? 
 They're really busy, him and Nige. 
 TV : 'Joseph Miller was remanded back into custody after pleading not guilty here at Wessex Crown Court to the murder of 11-year-old Daniel Latimer, whose body was found on the beach at Broadchurch, in Dorset. Sharon Bishop, QC, representing Mr Miller, tonight maintained her client's innocence.' 
 No. No, don't. 
 Mr Miller vehemently denies the charge against him and is looking forward to defending himself in a court of law. 
 That's really not fair. 
 '.. from here at Wessex Crown Court. Now to the studio.' 
 Can he handle the pressure? 
 He steps up. 
 Straight down the middle! 
 That was never a penalty! 
 You shouldn't have tripped him up. 
 (PHONE) 
 It's Aunt Lucy. I better get back. 
 17 games to 14 in my favour. 
 You're just as good as Dan. 
 Tomorrow, again? 
 Definitely. 
 You sure no-one has this place? 
 Yeah. The woman who let me borrow her keys just disappeared. 
 What do you mean, disappeared? Where is she? 
 I came back one day and she was gone. 
 I've still got the keys. 
 It's nice, coming to meet you, even if you do win at FIFA. 
 Thanks, Mark! 
 See you. 
 There's extra blankets in the cupboard, Ellie. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 You all right in there, Miller? 
 Don't come in! 
 Course I'm not coming in. I'm on the sofa. 
 Goodnight. 
 (Fine.) Night. 
 Don't blame you for coming back here. It's gorgeous. 
 You never escape your home. 
 How are you? 
 Like you care (!) 
 Look. the reason I called, I'm after some context. 
 You know that I'm defending Joe Miller? 
 Can I ask you a favour? Don't. 
 Why? 
 Why would you want to? 
 Overwhelming forensic evidence, admission of guilt. 
 Let someone else do it. 
 Jocelyn. 
 You haven't been my boss in a very long time. 
 No. Course not. I... Yeah. 
 I should have known. Fine. Fine. 
 Why are you so bothered, anyway? 
 Because I'll be prosecuting. 
 Yeah, right (!) 
 You're serious. 
 I'd hate to show up a former pupil. 
 So, you'd do it for them but not for... 
 Sure you're up to it? 
 I'm certain. 
 See you soon, then. 
 Bollocks. 
 OK, thanks. Be there soon as I can. 
 Miller, I need you to drive me. 
 No, I didn't sleep well, thanks for asking. Get a taxi. 
 A taxi'll take too long. I need to be there now. 
 Get your own car. 
 I can't. 
 Medically. Can we go? 
 Go where? 
 I'll call you. Miller, come on! 
 See you. 
 Look at you, his little puppy. 
 Hey, Fred, you going too? Bye-bye! Come back soon! 
 (DOORBELL) 
 Oh. Hi. 
 He's got bad news. 
 Who has? Oh, hi, Ben. Mark, Jocelyn's here with Ben. 
 You're taking our case, then? 
 This trial is gonna put more demands on you. I'll put more demands on you. 
 We want the truth to come out. 
 Knowing the truth and getting justice isn't the same thing. 
 We understand that. 
 No, you really don't. Not if you've never been through this. 
 I'll need to know everything about you, everything about Danny, everything about the Millers. 
 Nothing will stay hidden. 
 Joe Miller has got a tough defence team. They'll move fast and fight dirty. 
 In fact, they already are. 
 In what way? 
 You know the wardrobe in that bedroom? 
 I found a letter wrapped in cloth. 
 Well, I say letter, it was a bluebell in an envelope. 
 What do you mean, a bluebell? 
 Well, just that, a single flower. 
 This right, here. 
 This is the road to the church. 
 I know. 
 Why are we going to the church? 
 Just let me out and drive away. 
 No! 
 Tell me they're not going to do this. 
 They've got a court order. Ellie. 
 Somebody tell me what's going on. 
 Back in the car, Miller! 
 Joe's legal team have requested a new autopsy on Danny's body. 
 It means an official exhumation. 
 Oh, God, no. 
 Give me that. Give me that. 
 Ellie. 
 My boy is in there! 
 You! Why can't you let him rest, eh? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 You couldn't resist, could you?

 I hope you rot in hell for what you've done to us! 
 Come on, Mum. Come away. 
 Do something, Paul. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Ey, ey, ey. Come on, eh? 
 You all right? 
 Who's that? 
 It's Lee Ashworth. 
 You're kidding. 
 Look at him standing there gloating. 
 Why are you so sure he killed those girls?
