 Mentalist   'men-t3-list  noun. Someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion. A master manipulator of thoughts and behavior. 
 What do we got? 
 Jim Gulbrand, C.E.O. and founder of the software company gaia matrix, was reported missing by his live-in brother yesterday. 
 Local P.D. responded to the call, but they didn't check the boat until this morning. 
 They found blood on the deck, but no sign of a body. 
 Why is it ours? 
 The marina is privately owned, on lease by the city of sausalito. 
 It was local P.D.'s decision whether or not to take the case. 
 Mm, a high-profile missing persons case. 
 I wonder why they wouldn't take that. 
 You coming? 
 He's not feeling well. Stomach. 
 I'm fine. 
 You get me sick, I'm gonna put you on stakeout for a month. 
 Yes, boss. 
 This is it? 
 Yeah. 
 No sign of struggle, no weapon? 
 Nothing. 
 What else do we know about the victim? 
 Jim Gulbrand is 33 years old. 
 He lives here in sausalito, has an estimated net worth of $100 million. 
 He's rich. Very rich. 
 He's also recently divorced from one Kathryn stubbs-Gulbrand. 
 Does the victim have a criminal record? 
 No.The company he founded, gaia matrix, was under investigation by the S.E.C.for securities violations. 
 ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ 
 He was facing heavy fines and federal prison time. 
 Do you need my help with... Never mind. 
 Maybe it's all just an elaborate hoax. 
 That would explain why there's no body. 
 You take a boat out, you go missing, everybody assumes you're at the bottom of the ocean. 
 Your body and yr killer are never to be found. 
 That'd make perfect sense. 
 This one? No. 
 Nope. 
 How about this one? 
 Ah, sorry. 
 What are you doing? 
 Well, there's no use in being anchored when you're tied up at the dock. 
 After you. 
 Miss Red 
 ****** 
 When did you notice your brother was missing? 
 Well, Jim and I talked every day. 
 I knew something was wrong when he didn't come home. 
 So you live here with your brother, keith? 
 Uh, for a few months, semi-temporarily. 
 Jim wanted company during his divorce. 
 After you, bro. 
 Tell us about your brother— who he associated he with, what drove him. 
 Well, Jim's life was gaia matrix. Yeah. 
 That's the company he started with Rick. Green, um... 
 Platform... Software. Don't ask me what that is. 
 Rick being Rick Bregman? 
 Rick and Jim were best friends from grade school, and they built a whole empire out of our parents' garage. 
 At the uh... At the time I was totally bummed, you know, 'cause I'm like, "dude, where do I set up my drum kit now? " 
 Well, little did I know. 
 What about his personal life? Was he dating anyone? 
 Brooke Harper— cool woman... 
 For a psychiatrist. 
 Oh, she's a psychiatrist. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, works at the sausalito rehab center. 
 I was in there for, um, refresher course, and that's how they first met, when, um, Jim came to visit. 
 Did your brother and brooke have any arguments lately? Anything like that? 
 No. Jim's crazy about her. 
 He said, uh, she's the only woman that could figure him out. 
 I think he was gonna propose to her. 
 Your brother was recently divorced, right? 
 From a, uh, Kathryn stubbs-Gulbrand? 
 Best thing he ever did. 
 That woman was a... Nightmare. 
 How so? 
 She was just a giant greed head. 
 I mean, all she wanted was a bigger house, bigger boat, more jewelry... 
 Do you, uh, play all these instruments? 
 Uh, keyboards and bass mostly. 
 Is it a sort of a new-age rock fusion? 
 Yeah. Kinda... Yeah. You know, with an edge? 
 How did you know, man? 
 Ah, wild guess. 
 You make much money doing this, playing the keyboards? 
 No. No. But I'm not in it for the money. You know, music's a... 
 It's a spiritual thing. 
 Yeah, it is. So is money. 
 Everything that exists has a spiritual essence or not at all. 
 So what happens to all this? Who gets it? 
 A portion of the estate will go to the charities that Jim supported, And the rest will go to me. 
 Ah, moti. 
 Chill, man. 
 Oh, I'm just playing. 
 Where were you friday night? 
 I... 
 Was in bed with a lady friend... 
 Gretchen somethin', um... 
 Number? 
 Thank you. 
 What do you reckon? 
 Possible. 
 You? 
 I don't know. 
 Cho, write down this number. 
 Got it. 
 Gretchen, no last name. 
 It's the brother's alibi for last friday night. 
 Have Van Pelt check it out. 
 You and Rigsby go and talk to Gulbrand's partner, Rick bregman. 
 He should be at gaia matrix. 
 All right. Will do, boss. 
 Riby. 
 What? 
 Never mind. 
 ****** 
 I'm agent cho. This is agent Van Pelt, CBI. 
 I'm stuart hanson. I'll take you to Rick. 
 Right. 
 What's your job here, Mr. Hanson? 
 Jim hates labels and pigeonholes. 
 I'm kind of the security chief, but that sounds so fascistic, doesn't it? 
 What I am really is the firewalls and encryptions and off-the-wall ideas guy. 
 Rick's been in the conference room all morning, dealing with the fallout from Jim's death. 
 He's pretty broken. We all are. 
 Jim meant so much to this company, to all of us. 
 The company is co-owned by you and Jim, is that right? 
 Yes. 
 How did that relationship work, exactly? 
 Jim was the creative brain behind gaia matrix. 
 He was the visionary. 
 I handled the business side. 
 We made a good team. You know, he was a genius, but he wasn't... 
 Aggressive. 
 Me, I'm a jock... Competitive. I like to win, make no apologies for it. 
 Is that what got you into trouble with the S.E.C.? 
 Um, my lawyers warned me that this line of questioning might come up, And this is all I'm prepared to say on that subject at the moment— 
 I am currently under investigation by the S.E.C. for securities violations due to my role here at gaia matrix. 
 That doesn't sound like you said anything. 
 You understand why I can't comment any further. 
 Did the investigation cause any animosity between you and Jim? 
 No. Not at all. We were like brothers. 
 Where were you the night of his murder? 
 Home... Alone. Look, you're not getting this. 
 Jim was the creative genius behind gaia matrix. 
 Without him, this company is in grave jeopardy. 
 I had nothing to gain and everything to lose by his death. 
 Dr. Harper, how long have you been dating Jim Gulbrand? 
 It was just after I transferred here from boston, so seven months ago now. 
 His... 
 An acquaintance of his was staying here uh, we hit it off right away. 
 Could you think of anyone who, uh... 
 Excuse me— might want him dead? 
 I've thought about that a lot this morning, and... 
 I can't think of anyone. 
 Jim was a kind, gentle, generous, brilliant man. 
 I can't imagine anyone being capable of doing something so awful to him. 
 Really? You're a psychiatrist, and you can't imagine that? 
 To be more precise, I can't imagine a rational reason for wishing him dead. 
 It's, uh, standard procedure to ask— um, where where you on the night of the murder? 
 I was here, finishing up some work. 
 If you'd like, I could have the admin nurse send over the paperwork documenting my hours. 
 Yeah, that would be helpful. Thank you. 
 Do you have any... Leads on the investigation so far? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. We don't discuss our process, ma'am. 
 Uh, when exactly did you learn of your boyfriend's murder? 
 If you want to know why I'm at work the same day that my boyfriend is found dead, Why don't you just ask me? 
 Okay. Uh, why are you at work the same day your boyfriend is found dead? 
 I have patients who need me. 
 And if I had to sit at home and actually think about Jim being... Gone... 
 I'd lose it. 
 Being here, whether it... 
 Looks good to you or not, is the only way I know how to cope. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, I'm okay. 
 Uh, no. 
He's—he's been quite sick. 
 Well, let me have a look at you. 
 I'm fine. 
 Fever. 
 Nausea? Coughing? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Flu. 
 Look, I'm not really supposed to do this, but if you want, I can write a prescription for an antiviral. 
 Uh, sure. 
 Have this filled and... 
 You will feel better in no time. 
 Uh, sure. Thanks. 
 Thank you. 
 Any word from Gulbrand's partner? 
 Not muchpin the way of motive, but he doesn't have an alibi for the night of the murder. 
 Gulbrand's brother, pon the other hand, checked out. 
 A gretchen moore says he was with her the night of the murder. 
 Roommate backs up the story. 
 Are you still sick? 
 Man, go see a doctor. 
 I did. The dead guy's girlfriend wrote me a prescription. 
 So go fill it. 
 Nah. By the time I take it, I'll be better. 
 What'd she give you anyway? 
 Oseltamivir phosphate. 
 May I see that? 
 Anything abouthis strike you as odd? 
 What's odd about it? 
 "oseltamivir phosphate." 
 Exactly. You can read it. 
 When was the last time you saw a doctor's handwriting that you could read? 
 So she's precise. Is that what you're implying? 
 Yes, and the possibility that Dr. Brooke Harper is not a doctor. 
 Because she has penmanship skills? 
 And she doesn't have that cold, creepy, doctor-y vibe they all have. 
 Well, be fair. Not all doctors are cold and creepy. 
 First day of medical school, they get a stack of books and a dead human being—that, I'm afraid, will change you, brooke Harper was warm and emotional. 
 You like her, so she can't be a doctor. 
 Pretty much. 
 The a.m.a.and boston general both have records of a doctor named brooke Harper. 
 See? 
 But it says here that she's 64 years old. 
 She looks pretty good. 
 Is there a word for uncanny and irritating? 
 Jeff, I'm going to be leaving the clinic shortly, So this is going to be our last session together. 
 Oh, no, no, no. I-i-i need you, Dr. Harper. 
 How will I manage without you? 
 I'm sorry, jeff.I have enjoyed our sessions together, but I'm sure the clinic will provide you with the best care possible. 
 Should you ever need to speak with me personally... 
 ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ 
 I'm very sorry to interrupt, Dr. 
Harper, but the CBI are here again, and they need to speak with you. 
 All right. Well, tell them I'll be with them in ten minutes. 
 They said they needrto speak with you right now, this moment, and they are most insistent. 
 Tell them I'll be right out, maggie. Thank you. 
 I mean, I just... 
 I feel like I'm on the verge of a real breakthrough. I... 
 I'm starting to open myself up again to people in a real way. 
 My inner child is finally emerging. 
 D— Dr. Harper? 
 Dr. Harper? 
 ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ 
 Damn. Let's go. 
 All I was able to find at Dr. Brooke Harper's apartment. 
 Bank account emptied, credit cards maxed out. 
 She must have been packed and ready to leave days ago. 
 Her social security number and medical license are fakes, too. 
 We have no idea who this woman is. 
 Well, we know that she's smart. 
 She posed as a doctor for seven months, managed to elude you and Rigsby. 
 No, she had a head start. 
 She didn't elude us. 
 All right, she eluded us. 
 Well, she's a professional conwoman. 
 I mean, she probably specializes in the seduction of rich and successful, socially awkward men. 
 You think she's done this before? 
 Oh, yes, many times. 
 Why kill Jim Gulbrand? 
 What's her motive? 
 Maybe he found outvthe truth about her. 
 Then why not just vanish? 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 I've been going through Gulbrand's financial records and found something interesting. 
 Last year, Gulbrand made a series of cash withdrawals from various accounts, totaling $10 million. 
 What'd he spend the money on? 
 That's just it. He didn't deposit it, and it doesn't look like he spent it. 
 So either he paid somebody off or he hid the money— 
 A cash nest egg—either from his ex-wife or the S.E.C. 
 Maybe that's what brooke Harper was after. 
 If only we knew who she was or where she was. 
 Well, we know that she's ol, she's fearless, she's systematic. 
 I mean, she went back to the clinic for an extra day to try and hook another sucker. 
 She's a planner. 
 Could we get a copy of her last credit card statement? 
 I can get it. 
 And they had the nerve to send me a gold mercedes instead of a black one, And so I sent it back. 
 Kathryn Gulbrand? 
 Kathryn stubbs-Gulbrand, and you're interrupting. 
 'Am, we have a few questions regarding your ex-husband's death. 
 Really? You wantrto talk to me now? 
 Or we can talk to you at the station, if you prefer. 
 Fine. 
 Thank you. Thank you, ladies. 
 How long had you and Jim Gulbrand been divorced? 
 14 months— that's when I moved out. 
 The divorce was final a year ago. 
 Were you angrypabout the divorce? 
 Of course I was angry. That's usually why people get divorced. 
 Court documents indicate that you sued your ex-husband on multiple occasions. 
 You bet your ass I did. 
 Jim tried to claim that the money that he had in gaia matrix stock wasn't actually his, But part of the company's capital. 
 I disagreed, and I won. 
 I got everything I wanted and more. 
 We have reason to believe that your ex-husband may have hidden money from you during the divorce proceedings. 
 What? 
 He made $10 million in cash withdrawals last year. 
 You weren't aware of that? 
 That son of a bitch. I knew it. I knew he was holding out. 
 That wasn't a damn gym locker key, was it? 
 What key? 
 Last year he started wearing this key around his neck, under his shirt. 
 I asked him what it was, and he said that it was his gym locker key. 
 But I knew it wasn't. I knew it. 
 How perceptive. 
 What was that? 
 Oh, nothing, ma'am. 
 So you didn't know anything about the money? 
 If I did, it wouldvbe mine right now. 
 Where is it? 
 We don't know. 
 Well, half that money's legally mine. 
 I don't want Jim's loser brother getting his loser hands on it. 
 I'm sure your probate judge will take care of it. 
 Last friday, the, uh, night of your ex-husband's murder, where were you from 7:00 through 10:00 p.m.? 
 I was at a wine tasting in napa. 
 Could anyone confirm that for us? 
 Can you people charge mevwith any crime? 
 Uh, no, but— -uh, no, you can't. 
 When you can, maybe then I'll tell you the details of my personal life. 
 Until then, mind your own business. 
 I just got off the phone with our liaison at the S.E.C.turns out Jim Gulbrand Was cooperating with their investigation. 
 Rick bregman never mentioned it. 
 Make sure you mention it to him. 
 What's this? 
 Brooke Harper only used a credit card twice in the last two week this is what she bought In one day of shopping nine days ago, and this is what she bought yesterday. 
 Now what do these things tell us? That's a wig, by the way. 
 What's that on the, uh, bottom right? 
 Bandage. 
 It doesn't look like a bandage. 
 It's a bandage. 
 What do these things tell you? 
 Brooke Harper wanted to pose as a man? 
 Right. 
 But why? 
 And what's that other stuff? 
 Well, that's—that's the puzzle. 
 Is that Kathryn stubbs? 
 She's... She's an unhappy person. 
 Where's Rigsby? 
 He went to get his prescription filled. 
 I think that Kathryn woman actually made him worse. 
 She's hiding something, too. 
 She wouldn't say who she was with the night of the murder. 
 Keep an eye on her. 
 Interesting. 
 She did tell us that Gulbrand wore a key around his neck, that he said it was for his gym locker. 
 Only there wasn't a key found on the body, as there? 
 No. 
 She took his key. 
 That's why she dressed as a man, so that she could get into his locker in the men's changing room of the gym. 
 But if she had foundpjim's millions, then she would have simply vanished right then and there. 
 Why stick around? 
 Because the money wasn't in the locker. 
 Exactly. 
 She's now trying to get inside somewhere else. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Good afternoon. May I help you? 
 Yeah. I'm Jim Gulbrand. I'm a member here. 
 Uh, sir? 
 I-I know Mr. Gulbrand well, and you are not he. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm just confirming that Jim Gulbrand's a member here. 
 Why not just ask? 
 Go ahead. Ask him. 
 Is Jim Gulbrand a member here? 
 I'm sorry, sir. We don't divulge membership details. 
 See? 
 This is a murder investigation. Mr. Gulbrand is dead. 
 Well, I'm very sorry to hear that. 
 Well, thanks for your help. 
 Oh, sir. Sir, this— this is a private club. 
 What I'm learning Is one can't just wander in here and hang out. 
 One needs a plan. 
 We're gonna have to take a look around. 
 That's not our policy, sir. 
 If we have to obtain with a warrant, we're gonna come back here and take every computer And every piece of paper in this building, and then we're gonna have a sit-down chat with each one of your members. 
 Welcome to the backgammon club. 
 Thank you. 
 I don't get it. What is she doing? 
 I don't know. Maybe she likes the water. 
 Aryou feeling better? 
 Eah, much. It's weird. 
 I know brooke Harper's not a real doctor, but whatever she gave me really worked. 
 Good. I was getting worried about you. 
 Grace? 
 I've been thinking that maybe— - Here we go. 
 Rick bregman. 
 The best friend and business partner. 
 Anlover of the ex-wife. 
 Apparently. 
 Double? 
 No. You win. 
 Outrageous luck you have, no? 
 You are a monster. 
 What is it now? 
 What is it? 
 20000. 
 20000. 
 I must have my revenge. 
 Well, if you insist. 
 Jane. 
 What? 
 You want me to spell it out? 
 We're just having fun, right? 
 Ablutely. 
 The first prince I've ever met. 
 How sweet. 
 Thank you. 
 There she blows. 
 Uh, prince, uh, can I be excused from this game? 
 My date just arrived. 
 Of course. 
 Maybe that's lucky for me, eh? 
 Probably. 
 $20,000? 
 Enjoy. 
 Hey, listen. Just, uh, just forget about that, okay? 
 Certainly not. 
 You won fair and square. 
 Well, actually, I cheated. Uh, I controlled the dice. 
 It's in the wrist, just in the wrist. 
 Please don't be offended. I-i would have taken your money and given it to a worthy cause, But my friend here is a moralist of childish simplicity. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Hello, gorgeous. 
 Beat it, creep. 
 I'd call you by your real name, but I don't know wt it is. 
 Hello, Mr. Jane. 
 I'm impressed. Well done. 
 Oh, for finding you? 
 It wasn't that difficult. 
 Would you have a cigar? 
 Ah, thank you, no. 
 I hear they're not so good for your health. 
 Well, who wants to live forever? 
 It'd be horrible, wouldn't it? 
 Immortality? Imagine the boredom. 
 My friend cho here will now take you by the wrists so as not to let you escape us again. 
 Warm hands. 
 Ah, I bet you say that to all your arresting officers. 
 Who are you, brooke? 
 How did you find me? 
 Well, let's make a deal. 
 I'll tell you how we found you if you tell us who you are. 
 Okay. 
 My name is angela dalibar, and I'm from birmingham, england, by way of hong kong. 
 How did you find me? 
 I planted a g.p.s.tracking device on you. 
 Outstanding technology. 
 No bigger than a stick of gum. 
 Can you tell us more about yourself, angela? 
 How long have you been a professional conwoman? 
 All my life, I suppose. 
 And I confess, my name's not really angela. 
 And I didn't plant a g.p.s.tracking device on you. 
 How then? 
 Well, maybe you're not as enigmatic and elusive as you think you are. 
 I wouldn't be so sure of that. 
 No? 
 You manipulate people because you take pleasure in it. 
 You enjoy being the smartest person in the room. 
 You're interested in money, of course, but only so far as it allows you to continue conning people. 
 You allow yourself one indulgence— not men, obviously. 
 Not drinking or drugs, because you fear that they will impair your abilities. 
 You move around too much to have a pet. 
 So my guess... 
 Chocolate. 
 You're good. 
 So why do you do this, brooke? 
 Neglected as a child? 
 Is this your way of getting attention? 
 Or is it something a little darker? 
 Just a genuine mystery, I suppose. 
 Well, we have your prints now, so we'll know who you are soon enough. 
 Do you think one can ever truly know another person? 
 I doubt it. 
 How do you come to have Jim Gulbrand's key in your possession? 
 He gave it to me. 
 Didn't tell you what it would unlock? 
 It wasn't given as a real key. It was a symbol... 
 Of our love. 
 It's the key to his heart. 
 You said "our love" with conviction. 
 Are you trying to tell us that you loved him, too? 
 Yes, to my great surprise. 
 I did come to love him, in a way. 
 He was a good, kind man. 
 So sweet. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Yes, this is also the key to a locker that holds $10 million. 
 Really? I thought it was for cigars. 
 I love a good cigar. 
 Nope. $10 million. 
 But that's just silly. 
 Why would Jim keep $10 million in a locker? 
 She's good. 
 Yeah, she is. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Duh, looking for the money. 
 Rick figured maybe there were secret compartments on the boat or something. 
 How long have you been seeing Rick bregman romantically? 
 About a year. 
 You were divorced from Jim Gulbrand about a year ago. 
 Were you and Rick involved while you were still married to Jim? 
 Involved? 
 Were you having sexual intercourse with him? 
 No. Rick would never do that to Jim. 
 But you would. 
 I ha needs just like anybody else. 
 I refuse to be ashamed of my needs. 
 Then why did you lie to us about your relationship? 
 Because I knew how it would look. 
 You knew it'd make you look guilty of Jim's murder? 
 No. Yes. It's just... 
 It wasn't just that. 
 Gaia matrix's stock has been falling for months. 
 This market has hurt even the best of companies. 
 The last thing I need issome "page six" s*x scandal to make things worse. 
 So you misled us in order to protect your money. 
 I misled you to protect the company that Jim and I built from the ground up. 
 Were you aware that Jim Gulbrand was cooperating with S.E.C.investigators? 
 Jim would never go behind my back like that. 
 Well, he would, and he did. 
 The question is, if you found out, what would you do to stop him? 
 This conversation is over. 
 When did you find out about the $10 million he was hiding? 
 Over. 
 $10 million? That's a lot of money. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Jim trusted you with the security of his company. 
 He valued your, uh, outside-the-box thinking. 
 You advised him on what to do with the money, didn't you? 
 Didn't you? 
 We don't care if hiding the money was legal or unethical. 
 Our focus is the homicide investigation. 
 I-it's not that. It's just... 
 I absolutely promised Jim I wouldn't say anything. 
 We found out Jim's girlfriend, brooke Harper, is a conwoman. 
 We think she was after the money and might have murdered Jim to get it. 
 We found her, along with this key, trying to open Gulbrand's cabinet at the backgammon club. 
 The key didn't work. 
 Evidently, she took it from Jim, but she doesn't know where the money is. 
 That's some lady. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 If you help us find the money, we can prove that brooke was looking for it, And establish a motive for murder. 
 So, stuart, do you know where the money is? 
 No. Well, n-not exactly, anyway. 
 Jim did come to me for some out-of-the-box security advice. 
 Like you said, he wanted to hide the money from his ex-wife. 
 I told him that safety deposit boxes and offshore accounts could be traced rather easily, So they wouldn't be of any use. 
 So where'd you tell him to hide it? 
 Off the grid. 
 Out of the financial institutions, any place a trail couldn't be established. 
 Like a home safe? 
 No. 
 Anything on his property is subject to search. 
 No, it had to be secure— obviously, hence the key— 
 But more importantly, it had to be a place that no one would think to look. 
 Hidden in plain sight. 
 Yes. 
 But that's the extent of my involvement. 
 I have no idea where he actually hid the money. 
 Oh, yeah. I see. 
 Oopsy. Yeah. 
 Don't want to go losing that, now do we? 
 What do you make of it? 
 You think he knows where Jim hid the money? 
 I think he knows the general whereabouts of the money, but he doesn't know exactly. 
 And the devil is in the details, isn't he? 
 Here's what happened. 
 I'm all ears. 
 Two weeks ago, you took the locker key from around Jim's neck when he was sleeping And replaced it with an identical one so Jim was none the wiser. 
 Then when you tried to open the locker at the gym, the key didn't fit. 
 So the money was hidden somewhere else, but where? 
 Last friday, you got impatient, and you pushed Jim to tell you where he'd hidden the money. 
 Jim wouldn't tell you. You got mad, and you killed him. 
 No. 
 You probably didn't do it on purpose, did you? 
 It was an accident. 
 It wasn't. 
 I didn't do it. 
 Sad thing is, with all your skills, the answer was right there in front of you. 
 You just didn't see it. 
 You didn't do enough research. 
 You're playing me. You don't know either. 
 Jim's security systems are all designed by the same man at gaia matrix. 
 Stuart hanson. 
 Him. 
 He suggested where to put the money. 
 You could have squeezed the truth out of him very swiftly, I imagine— 
 Putty to a woman like you— but instead, you had to kill a man. 
 I wouldn't do that. You don't know me.

 Then you disappeared off the records for a couple years, and when you came back, You were a con artist with two fraud convictions. 
 What happened? 
 Nothing happened. 
 I like money, and I'm easily bored. 
 There's gotta be more to it than that. 
 It's a cold, hard, lonely life you lead. 
 What is it that drives you? 
 Passion for excellence. 
 Okay. 
 Relax a while. 
 Uh, an agent will be in here to run you through the formal charges against you. 
 Run away. Good luck, lindsey. 
 And to you. 
 Any luck with Harper? 
 There's no luck involved. 
 The outcome's a given. 
 Is that so? 
 Yeah, it's all applied psychology and newtonian physics. 
 Excuse me. Ma'am? Can I see some i.d., please? 
 You call that a uniform shirt? It's filthy. 
 Well, I tried to clean— - filthy. 
 No excuses, stiles. 
 I will address this matter with your captain at my earliest convenience. 
 Is she on the move yet? 
 She made one stop and hasn't left her motel room since. 
 What'd she stop for? 
 Chocolate. 
 Oh, and, uh, thank you. 
 For what? 
 For just letting this play out like this. 
 Eh, we would have had to let her go on the murder charge anyway. 
 Nothing to keep her on until we get some hard proof. 
 And besides, this is a simple plan. 
 It's when you start getting costumes and props that I get nervous. 
 Trick plays like this? 
 My dad calls them chewing gum plays. 
 Sometimes you fool the other guy, and sometimes you just get gum in your hair. 
 She's moving. 
 Train station. It had to be a train station. 
 What's wrong with the train station? 
 People, noise, tunnels, trains, more people. 
 Her vehicle's stopped outside the station. 
 Hold your positions until I give you the word. 
 Yes, boss. Standinby. 
 Copy that. 
 All set. 
 Chewing gum plays. 
 I can already see my hair with a big chunk out of it. 
 You'd look good with short hair. 
 Choppy, a littgood for the eyes. 
 Okay, heads-up. 
 She's in motion, approaching the station now. 
 Cho, do you have a visual? 
 Affirmative. She's exiting the vehicle now. 
 She has stuart hanson with her. 
 She has a gun. Be advised— brooke Harper is armed. 
 Rigsby, Van Pelt, what's your status? 
 I have Harper and hanson in sight. 
 Van pelt, she's moving your way. 
 Got 'em. Looks like she's headed to the commuter lockers. I'm on it. 
 It's the gate. I'm stuck. 
 All right, don't move. 
 Don't do anything and don't say anything. 
 This better be the right place. 
 She opened the locker. I think she has the money. 
 Okay, ijust wait a moment. 
 Oh, my. 
 Don't move or I'll kill you. 
 Don't move! 
 ****Hanson. 
 I got him. Excuse me. 
 Gun. 
 You're under arrest... Again. 
 Let's go. 
 Jason bradshaw, jason wade, anthony wade, anthony samuels, the list goes on— 
 All aliases you've used in scams ranging fro identity theft to ponzi schemes. 
 You're quite the virtuoso. 
 Thank you. 
 But this one— this would have been your most daring and successful crime yet. 
 $10 million of Jim Gulbrand's money. 
 Gulbrand was the perfect mark— rich, liquid and unconventional. 
 I bet he didn't even check your references when he hired you. 
 Nothing says trustworthy like a wheelchair. 
 You convinced Gulbrand that the train station was a genius place to hide his money. 
 Screw orthodox wisdom. 
 Think sideways, right? Right? 
 And he ate it up. 
 He ate it up. 
 Why wouldn't he? Then you simply needed to get the key. 
 You went to the yacht that night because you knew he'd be alone. 
 You also knew he kept the key with him. 
 You did what needed to be done. 
 You killed Jim Gulbrand. 
 Then you got rid of the body. 
 But you didn't count on brooke Harper. 
 You couldn't have known she swapped the real key... 
 With a look-alike. 
 You didn't realize anything was wrong until you tried to open the locker. 
 It wasn't until we came to gaia matrix with the real key... 
 That it dawned on you what she'd done. 
 I can only imagine your surprise. 
 Six months living in that chair. 
 Six months, and no one ever questioned me about it. 
 Why did you? 
 Whenever I meet someone in a wheelchair, I check the bottoms of their shoes. 
 The bottoms of your shoes... 
 Were scuffed. 
 I've been checking shoes for years. This is the first time it's ever paid off. 
 First time. 
 That's gratifying, man. Very, very gratifying. 
 Oh, he's a pistol, isn't he? 
 Sorry about the cuffs. 
 My own fault. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Wi I could let you go again, but you know... 
 I understand. 
 That urge you have to get one over on people, the need to be smarter than the next guy... 
 It'll keep biting you on the ass. 
 So my butt'll hurt occasionally. 
 I'll still be smarter than the next guy. 
 Brooke Harper? 
 No, Jessica Waters. Th-that's Harper right there. 
 Uh, agent? This is Harper. 
 Worth a try. 
 Of course. 
 Brooke Harper, I'm agent Fred Hayes. 
 I'll be in charge of transporting you to the federal detention center in Davis. 
 Let's go. 
 See you around, Patrick. 
 I doubt you'll be seeing much of anybody for a few years. 
 Oh, I don't know about that, agent hayes. 
 She's very good at what she does. 
 Yeah.
