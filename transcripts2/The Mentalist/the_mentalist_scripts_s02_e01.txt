 Lisbon : Morning, captain. Agent Lisbon. Jane, consultant. What do we have here? 
 Captain : Thanks for stepping in. Homicide unit owes you one. Jane. You're that psychic fella. 
 Jane : Right. 
 Captain : Me? I don't buy into that E. S.P. Crap. No offense. 
 Jane : None taken. 
 Captain : Here we have Ivor Rassmussen, age 34, address river park no sign of the murder weapon. Store security was on the scene pretty fast. We were able to detain everybody who was in the section at the time. We're holding them over in the furniture department. So, Carnac, what does Ivor say? He tell you who done it? 
 Jane : Leather pants, musky cologne, phallic jewelry. A ladies' man. Went after high-end cougars with moderate success. Casual cocaine user. Plays guitar—not well. Works in the noncreative end of a creative business. Advertising, maybe. Nothing worth killing anyone over anyway. So he died from romantic reasons. Where are those suspects you mentioned? 
 Captain : The witnesses? 
 Jane : Whatever. 
 Lisbon : Take it down a notch. Take it down three notches. 
 Jane : Okay. Under control we'll get this done quick and be on our way. Hello. We're from the CBI. May well be that one of you is the murderer. If that's so, I'm gonna find out who. These two are innocent. They can go. 
 Lisbon : Uh, stick around. We're gonna need a statement. 
 Jane : Neil. What's the worst mistake you've ever made? Quick. 
 Neil : Uh, first marriage. 
 Jane : Good answer. Why so nervous? 
 Neil : I'm not. I just—i... (mouths word) 
 Jane : You. Your name? 
 Candice : Candice. 
 Jane : Candice. That name. Here. Thank you. It's okay. I'm a consultant. Candice, take my advice. Forgive your mother. Maybe the headaches will stop 
 Candice : I love my mother. 
 Jane : Oh, I'm wrong. Ignore my advice. You. Your name. 
 Reed : Reed. 
 Woman : Excuse me. This is a joke, right? 
 Jane : A joke? A man has been killed . Is that funny to you? Are you amused? 
 Woman : No, but— 
 Jane : Then sit. Reed, quick question. Green Lantern versus Thor— who wins? 
 Reed : Thor. 
 Jane : Oh, yeah. Why'd you kill Rassmussen? 
 Reed : I didn't. 
 Jane : All right. Now, you, Miss grumpy and entitled, what's your story? 
 Mandy : My name is Mandy Shultz. And I'll havyou know that my— 
 Jane : Let me guess. Your husband is a very important person. 
 Mandy : He is, as it happens. John's on the Modesto city council. And this is totally unprofessional and disrespectful. I'll have my husband take talk with your superiors. 
 Jane : Mandy, Mandy, Mandy. The diet pills are messing with your mind. This is Sacramento, the big city. Your husband means nothing here. 
 Captain : Okay, that's enough. Agent Lisbon? 
 Lisbon : Give him another moment. 
 Jane : Don't need a moment. Ca is all but closed. Mandy here is gonna lead us right to the murder weapon. 
 Mandy : What? 
 Jane : Take my hands. I need physical contact to read your mind. 
 Mandy : You're nuts. 
 Jane : Prove it. If I'm wrong, if we can't find the murder weapon, then I look like an idiot. 
 Mandy : Yes, you will. What are you— 
 Jane : Don't speak. (box lid falls) Voila! The murder weapon. 
 Mandy : This is crazy. I had no idea that was there. 
 Captain : How could you direct us right to it if you didn't put it there? 
 Mandy : I didn't. I-I don't know. But I-I didn't kill that man. I-I didn't! 
 Jane : She's right. She has nothing to do with the murder. 
 Lisbon : What? 
 Jane : I just used her as a decoy to lull the real killer into giving me clean directional cues. 
 Captain : Oh, come on. What are you talking about now? 
 Jane : Whatever way he didn't wants to go is the way that we went. 
 Captain : The real killer. 
 Jane : Yeah, you wanna guess who it is? 
 Lisbon : Come on, Jane. 
 Jane : Neil. 
 Neil : Excuse me. No, i—it wasn't. I-I don't even know that man. 
 Jane : Oh, is that right? I'm guessing that he was having an affair with your current wife. You found out and you forgave her like a sucker. He saw you here, probably smirked and said something very clever, made you feel... Small. 
 Man : Grab him! 
 Jane : Humiliated you! 
 (both grunting) 
 (glass shattering) 
 Get him! Get him! 
 Stop! Stop! Uhh! 
 Lisbon : Nice work. 
 Jane : What? Case is closed, isn't it? 
 Voice  (man O. C.): Put it down! ( gunshot ) (woman screams) I say drop it now! 
 ( gunshots ) 
 Minelli : A dead suspect, quarter-million dollars worth of damages, formal complains of misconduct from the SPD and the Modesto City Council. 
 Lisbon : Those damages were way padded. 
 Jane : All due respect, Virgil, I was trying to close the case. It was my feeling that Red John should be our priority, given the dozen frh leads— - 
 Minelli : Stop! Stop. That's the nub of the problem right here... Red John. Ever since the Tanner incident, you've been runnin' way too hot. I fear a terminal screw up coming. 
 Jane : That's not gonna happen. I can handle him. 
 Minelli : Can you? Maybe since he saved your life, you're going easy on him. Maybe you feel compelled cut him some slack. 
 Lisbon : No, sir. This absolutely not the case. 
 Minelli : Hey, Sam, get in here. 
 Bosco : Lisbon. 
 Lisbon : Bosco. 
 Minelli : Agent Bosco and his unit are taking over the Red John case. 
 Jane : What? No, no, no. 
 Minelli : You have always been too close to the case, and now both of you are way or close. We need to make a change. 
 Lisbon : Can we talk about this? 
 Minelli : No. You've worked for agent Bosco. You know that he will do the job right. 
 Lisbon : You need to let my team finish what they started. 
 Bosco : Teresa, no offense, but you guys aren't even close to catching this guy. Fresh set of eye gotta be a good idea. 
 Jane : What do you know about the case? 
 Bosco : Not much. He's a serial killer. 15 victims, including your wife and child. I can imagine your pain. Maybe that pain is clouding your judgment. 
 Lisbon : And me, Sam? What's clouding my judgment? 
 Bosco : Good question. You tell me? 
 Rigsby : What happened? 
 Lisbon : We're off Red John. 
 Team : What? Forever? He can't do that. (Rigsby) Will we get reprimanded? (Van Pelt) Who gets it instead? 
 Lisbon : Quiet. Look, this is my fault, but it's a wake-up call for all of us. We've grown slack and unprofessional. We need to earn back the trust that we've lost. From now on, we work 100% straight. No more shortcuts. No more ga— What are you doing? You're leaving? 
 Jane : Well, frankly, if I can't use this job to seek some kind of personal revenge, then, uh, there's not a whole lot here for me. But I-I... I don't make anything better. I can't bring dead people back to life. What good do we do? We drive around California visiting unhappy people. 
 Van Pelt : We're fighting evil and injustice. 
 Jane : And how's that going? Any progress lately? 
 Cho : We put bad guys away where they can't hurt people. That's good enough. 
 Jane : I was doing more good as a psychic. I was giving people hope, at least. False hope, but hope anyway. 
 (telephone rings) 
 Van Pelt : Van Pelt. 
 Lisbon : You're right. Best you leave. That way you can go back to bei a full-time fraud and we can continue our useless jobs in peace. 
 Jane : Well, that's actually not what I said. 
 Lisbon : Yes, it was. 
 Van Pelt : We're up. Twenty palms. 
 Lisbon : Let's go. You come, too, Van Pelt. We'll take two vehicles in case need to split up. 
 Cho : I'll see you when you get there. 
 Rigsby : Boss, no disrespect, but I think we need Jane. 
 Lisbon : We'll manage. Maybe we don't close as many cases, but the ones we do close will be closed right, by professional. (buttons clicking) Van Pelt, it's not a jet plane. 
 Van Pelt : Okay, okay, okay. ( car alarm wails ) S-sorry. 
 Jane : Oh, I'm not gonna leave you in the lurch. I'll do one more case. 
 Lisbon : Do up your seat belt. 
 (starts engine) 
 (police radio chatter) 
 Lisbon : Van Pelt, you come with me. You guys talk to the first responders, see what they got. 
 Policeman : Hey, the apartment's upstairs. We have a female caucasian, late 3. Ran license down already. It a fake. We're calling her Jane Doe. 
 Lisbon : Who found the body? 
 Policeman : The building manager noticed her door was open overnight. Last one down to the left. 
 Jane : Thank you. 
 Lisbon : What's your take? 
 Van Pelt : Hit with a stun gun end suffocated with the cushion. And they were looking for something, obviously. 
 Jane : Did they find it, Grace? 
 Van Pelt : It's impossible to tell. 
 Jane : Well, it seems they look everywhere possible. Yes? 
 Van Pelt : Yeah. 
 Jane : So we can assume that they didn't find it, whatever it is. 
 Van Pelt : How so? 
 Jane : Well, let's say there's a hundred places to look for a thing. How likely is it that you will find it in the hundred places you look? 
 Lisbon : Not very likely, right? What else you got? 
 Van Pelt : Um... No drug paraphernalia, no condoms or other items suggesting prostitution. So... Maybe a personal crime? A husband or lover? 
 Jane : Bravo, Grace. Wrong, I expect but very well reasoned nonetheless. 
 (Patrick sighs) 
 Cho : Thank you, all. Appreciate it. Nothing off the car, but we'll have the lab boys take a look. It's still registered to the previous owner, sold it for cash six months ago. 
 Lisbon : So basically we know nothing about her. Nice start. 
 Jane : She's a law-abiding middle-class housewife that did something bad, something she feels terribly guilty about... guilty enough to make her run away and hide. 
 Lisbon : That's evidence. You know the drill. 
 Jane : You put "bullfrogs win high school basketball trophy" into a search engine, we will find Jane Doe's home. 
 Rigsby : Can I take a look at that? 
 Jane : Sure. 
 Rigsby : It's a working truck. Dad must be in construction, something like that. 
 Van Pelt : Bayshore Courier, April 2006. County finals— Lady Bullfrogs dominate injury-plagued Panthers. 
 Jane : If they list the players, cross-check the surnames with the other articles from the same newspaper in the last year using the word disappearance. 
 Cho : If we leave now, we can be in Bay Shore in a couple of hours. 
 Lisbon : Oh, we need a title more than lady bullfrogs to go on. 
 Van Pelt : "Bay Shore Courier" of June this year. Headline is "Police no closer to Dunninger." "since her disappearance last month, Bayshore PD have been unable to locate 43-year-old Monica Dunninger, the secretary accused of stealing nearly $1 million from her employers, the Jaffe Printing Group." 
 Lisbon : Okay. Bayshore it is then. 
 Van Pelt : So the killer must've been looking for the million bucks. 
 Rigsby : If she had a million bucks, why would she live in a dump like this? 
 Jane : Before we get on the freeway, it'd be good to take a little drive around the neighborhood, be good to find an empty house for sale. 
 Lisbon : Why would that be good? 
 Jane : I'm thinking of moving here. 
 Lisbon : No secrets, Jane. No lies. No tricks. No surprises. The truth. 
 Jane : Since when is that that rules? 
 Lisbon : Since I said so. 
 Jane : Else what? 
 Lisbon : You're off the unit. 
 Jane : That's not leverage. This is my last case, remember? The only reason I'm still here is 'cause I'm worried about how you guys would cope without me. 
 Lisbon : Oh, really? So we are lost without you, are we? 
 Jane : Well yeah. Let's be honest here. 
 ( Lisbon closes SUV rear door ) 
 Lisbon : Let's go. 
 (starts engine) 
 Jane : Wait. This... 
 (sighs) 
 (police radio chatter) 
 Whoa! 
 (brakes squeal) 
 (shifts gears) 
 Cho : What'd you say to em? 
 Jane : Nothing, really. Total overreaction. 
 Cho : Yeah. 
 (sighs) 
 Jane : We need to find a house for sale. 
 (seat belt clicks) 
 Cho : Ok. 
 (shifts gears) 
 Jane : Ah, there's a sign. (shifts gears) Perfect. 
 (knock on door) 
 (seat belt clicks) 
 Cho : You gonna tell me what that's about? 
 Jane : Wouldn't you rather it be a surprise? 
 Cho : No. 
 Jane : Oh, look. Look, look, strawberries. 
 Lisbon : Strawberries? 
 Jane : See? How good is that? 
 Lisbon : Good. Cho, Rigsby, start canvassing the neighbors. Van pelt, come with me. 
 Jane : Uh, I... Lisbon, uh... I'm sorry for what sayou before. Can I please continue working with you? 
 Lisbon : I thought you were quitting. 
 Jane : You know I didn't mean that. 
 Lisbon : So the job is worth while, is it? 
 Jane : Eh, it's not that. I mean, it's not that at all. It's just... I have nothing else to do. 
 Lisbon : No jokes. From now on, there have to be boundaries. 
 Jane : Agreed. 
 Lisbon : I need to know that you can do your work and be effective without creating a mess that I have to clean up. 
 Jane : No mess, I swear. 
 Lisbon : On that basis, you can remain with the unit. 
 Jane : Thank you. Here. 
 Man : So how did she die? 
 Lisbon : It s a homicide, but she didn't suffer. We don't have any suspects yet. 
 Man : Where was she? 
 Van Pelt : She was living alone in a small apartment in twenty palms. 
 Cassie : I thought she'd be living it up in Mexico or somepla. She was always— 
 Ansel : Stop it. I need to lie down. 
 Man : Okay, champ, let's roll. 
 (sighs) 
 Cassie : I'm making some tea. Would you like a cup? 
 Lisbon : No thank you. 
 Jane : Oh, oh, I-I'd love a cup. Thanks. 
 Cassie : Ansel, uh, had cancer. He's totally better now but still weak. 
 (water pouring) 
 Van Pelt : It's in remission? 
 Cassie : Gone. 100%. We were blessed. Even the doctors were amazed. 
 Jane : Oh, thank you. Tell me about your mother. 
 Cassie : Sure. I'll tell you. (sets down mug) Stealing all that money and running off... that was just the icing on the cake. When Ansel got cancer, her way coping... painkillers and a sleazebag lover. That's mom. 
 Jane : Did you know her lover's name? 
 Cassie : Bodhi Andros. How we found out? (scoffs) Ansel goes to meet his mom at her yogarobics class. He finds her banging the teacher in his office. Can you imagine? 
 Jane : Then what happened? 
 Cassie : She did her dance. She's so ashamed, she's so sorry, she's changed. Whatever. And dad was halfway to forgiving her. He cant help it. He loves her. 
 Jane : But you don' love her? 
 Cassie : She... Never had time for me. So. I could always see through her games. You know? To the selfish cow beneath— 
 Man : Cassie! Don't talk that way. She loved you. Look, she's dead. Show some respect. She was a beautiful soul, full of joy an-and big dreams. And reality just kinda beat her down. 
 Cassie : But here's the thing. It was only because the robbery was in the news that the doctors at cedars of zion heard about ansel and reached out to help us. They took him on for free and they save his life— saved his life when everybody said there was no hope. You know, god works in mysterious ways. 
 Jane : Well, you know, god doesn't necessarily, uh, answer— 
 Lisbon : Thank you very much for you time. 
 Jane : Yeah. Thank you. Very nice tea. Oh, uh, I almost forgot. Do either of you know a Miles Thorsen? 
 Man : Uh, no, I don't. 
 Cassie : No. 
 Jane : You sure? 
 Man : Yeah. 
 Cassie : Yes. 
 Jane : All right. Ansel. Hey, Ans! You know Miles Thorsen? 
 Ansel : No. 
 Jane : Okay. Bye. 
 Lisbon : Thank you. Who's Miles Thorsen? 
 Jane : No one in particular. 
 Lisbon : This is what I'm talking about. 
 Jane : No me, too. Y-you want no fuss, no mess, right? I am casting a wide, invisible net, the killer won't even know he's in it until it's too late. 
 Lisbon : Miles Thorsen is an invisible net? 
 Jane : Yes, he is. 
 Van Pelt : We got an address on Bodhi Andros. 
 Lisbon : Cho, Rigsby, go and check him out. Van Pelt, get on the money trail. Somebody's got that $1 million. Start with the dad and the daughter. See if either of them's been spending money they shouldn't have. 
 Van Pelt : They looked clean me. 
 Lisbon : Oh, did they? Okay, eat. Just let them be. 
 Van Pelt : I don't... I'll check 'em out. 
 Jane : Okay, come on. Let's get back to Sacramento, grumpy. 
 Lisbon : What's the hurry? 
 Jane : I have a meeting with Bosco. 
 Lisbon : Good luck. 
 
 
 
 (sitar music playing) 
 Woman : Great class, girls. Hey, and let's use that focus we found throughout the week, okay? Namaste. Namaste. Okay, thank you. 
 (click, music stops) 
 (beeping) 
 Cho : I'm looking for Bodhi Andros. 
 Woman : Oh, crap! Yeah, his office is upstairs, to the right. 
 Cho : Thank you. 
 Rigsby : Remember that time you said you'd been in juvie? 
 Cho : Yep. 
 Rigsby : You never said what you got sent there for. 
 Cho : It's gang stuff. 
 Rigsby : You were in a gang? What was the name of the gang? 
 Cho : Avon park playboys. 
 Rigsby : Avon park playboys? 
 (chuckles) 
 Cho : I didn't choose the name. 
 (door shuts) 
 Rigsby : And, uh, what kind of stuff did the playboys do? 
 Cho : Nothing good. 
 Rigsby : Like what? 
 Cho : Nothing you need to know about. 
 Rigsby : Mm, fair enough. Your call. See, I don't think partners should have secrets, but your call. 
 Cho : Like don't have any secrets. 
 Rigsby : What's the supposed to mean? 
 Cho : You know what I mean. Hey, you in there. Police. CBI. Very slowly, stand up. 
 Bodhi Andros : I'm unarmed, man. I have no weapons. 
 Rigsby : Well, that's great. So come out slowly with your hands on your head, and I won't hurt you. Promise. 
 Bodhi Andros : Okay, I'm coming out now. Don't shoot. 
 Rigsby : Morning, sir. You Bodhi Andros? 
 Bodhi Andros : Yes, I am. 
 Cho : Turn around. 
 Jane : Sorry I'm late. Bad traffic. What are you having? 
 Bosco : What are you having? 
 Jane : Well, I'll have a bottle of water, thanks. 
 Bosco : A dog with kraut, bottle of water. 
 (metal clangs) 
 Thank you. 
 Bosco : Keep it. 
 (nods) 
 Jane : Oh, thank you. I'm not happy I'm off the Red John case. You might be right. Fresh set of eye may be what's needed. Now here's the thing, Sam, if I may. I know this case. I can be a very good resource for you. If we could just come to some kind of understanding... 
 Bosco : You want me to, uh, keep you up to date on the case? 
 Jane : Yeah, sure. 
 Bosco : Tell you about fresh leads, etcetera. 
 Jane : Yeah, let's just keep an open line of communication. Good? 
 (mouth full) 
 Bosco : Wife has me on a diet. Mm-hmm. This is like committin' adultery here. (chuckles) Let me communicate this to you. You're a party entertainer, a clown. Fresh leads? I wouldn't tell you where the bathroom is if your ass was on fire. (Jane chuckles) Do we have a good understanding now? 
 Jane : I understand you. It may take you some time to understand me. 
 Bosco : You're filled with equal parts self-loathing and self-love. You're addicted to control. You're terrified of confinement. 
 Jane : Who's my favorite Beatle? 
 Bosco : Your wife wanted you to quit the psychic trade. She begged you to stop, but you were making too much money. You were havin' too much fun. You can still hear her pleading with you. How am I doin'? 
 Jane : You read the interviews in my case files. You can read very impressive. 
 Bosco : Look Patrick, I'm sorry to be so blunt with you. 
 Jane : Really? 
 Bosco : You're not a detective. You're a victim. 
 Lisbon : You never said. How was your meet with Bosco? 
 Jane : What? I can't hear you! 
 Lisbon : I said, how did it go with Bosco? 
 Jane : I can't... 
 Lisbon : (loudly) How did it go with Bosco? 
 Jane : Good. It was, uh, it was very good. We had a Frank exchange of views. 
 Lisbon : So he's gonna keep us in the loop? 
 Jane : No. 
 Lisbon : No? 
 Jane : Wouldn't direct me to the bathroom if my ass was on fire. Think that's funny? 
 (chuckles) Yeah. 
 Man : So that's Mrs. Jaffe over there. 
 Jane : Thank you. 
 Man : Sure 
 Lisbon : What are you gonna do? 
 Jane : Nothing. 
 Lisbon : Nothing? 
 Jane : If you sit down by he riverbank and wait long enough, you will see the bodies of your enemies float by. Shall we? 
 Rhonda Jaffe : Agent Lisbon, is it? I'm Rhonda Jaffe, company chairwoman. 
 Lisbon : This is my colleague Mr. Jane. 
 Rhonda : Hello. 
 Lisbon : Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. 
 Rhonda : Oh, not at all. And you wanted to meet with my finance director Greg Humphrey? 
 Lisbon : Yes, ma'am. 
 Rhonda : All right. Well, let's speak in my office. 
 Lisbon : Did you know Monica Dunninger? 
 Rhonda : Oh, yeah. I know everyone on staff. So sad. The whole thing is just so sad. The poor woman. More troubled than conniving, I'm sure. And you know, it's not the money. It's more the loss of trust. This is very, very much a family firm. And my father always used to say, Jaffe Printing is about values, not about machinery. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Jane : Do you know Miles Thorsen? 
 Rhonda : Miles Thorsen? No. 
 Jane : Are you sure? 
 Rhonda : Yes. 
 Lisbon : Seriously, stop it. 
 Jane : Relax. I saved her life. She resents me. 
 Rhonda : Oh, really? (beep) Jill? Jill? Jill, where has Greg Humphrey gone to? He's supposed to be in here. (beep) (beep) Hello? (beep) 
 Greg : Humble apologies. Small crisis on the inventory desk. Solved. Uh, Greg Humphrey. Good to meet you. 
 Jane : Patrick Jane. 
 Lisbon : We're investigating the murder of Monica Dunninger. 
 Greg : Yes. Terrible. Horrible. 
 Lisbon : You were her direct supervisor, is that right? 
 Greg : I know what you're gonna say, and yes, yes, it was my fault that she stole from us. Mea culpa. I-I should've known. 
 Rhonda : Greg is like family practically. 
 Greg : We all make mistakes We live, we learn, we move on. 
 Lisbon : Uh, can you explain to us how she did it? In layman's terms? 
 Greg : Been there, done that with the top men from the FBI financial unit. Do we really need to talk it again? 
 Lisbon : Yes. 
 Greg : No problem. 
 Jane : Thank you. 
 Lisbon : What exactly was her position here? 
 Greg : Assistant office manager. She kept the petty cash accounts. Coffee and doughnut monitor essentially. This was her office. 
 Lisbon : How did she manage to steal so much money? 
 Greg : When the accounting and finance systems were integrated, nobody thought to firewall the TTY cash accounts. Monica acquired user access to the transactional sites and created a false vendor. I didn't think she had the brains, to be honest. We don't know exactly how she did it because she fried her hard drive and she took her accounts book with her. 
 Jane : Are we about to look at a whole bunch of numbers? 
 Lisbon : Probably. 
 Jane : All right. I'll wait in the car. 
 Lisbon : Go. 
 (keyboard clacking) 
 Jane : Do you know a man named Miles Thorsen? 
 Greg : No. 
 Jane : You sure? Think about it. 
 Greg : I'm sure. Who is he? 
 Jane : Never mind. 
 Lisbon : Please continue. Would you excuse me? 
 (Van Pelt on phone) 
 Van Pelt : Boss, I think I found something. The victim's daughter, Kessie Dunninger... she handles the family money, pays the bills. Five months ago, she stopped paying the rent by standing order, switched to cash. Same thing with the utility bills. Paid in cash. 
 Lisbon : Nice work. Go and talk to her. She doesn't have a good answer, bring her in. 
 Van Pelt : Will do, boss. (whispers) Yes! 
 (keys jingling) 
 Cho : Why did you hide from us, Bodhi? 
 Bodhi : Fear, man. Fear. I've been frightened for my life here since I heard. 
 Cho : Why? Who killed her? 
 Bodhi : Either it was her goober husband finally snapped, which puts me next in line, or it's whoever she went into business with, and maybe they think I know too much. 
 Cho : She was in business with someone? 
 Bodhi : Just before she disappeared, she came by to see me, told me she made a business deal with someone that would make everything all right. 
 Cho : A business deal? Were those the words she used? 
 Bodhi : Yep. She was starting a new day in her life and wanted to make amends and apologize for being such a pain in the butt, which she was. 
 Cho : How so? 
 Bodhi : She was way too deep into her family and to her kids and all that crap. Loved those kids. Why do I want to talk to her about her sick boy? Like I can help? 
 Cho : You're not a doctor. 
 Bodhi : Exactly. When we were caught by that kid, she just... went to pieces, you know? And I'm like, don't get so down on yourself. You gotta love you even if you're a total screw up, right? The greatest. Love... of all. Whitney was right, as usual. 
 (whispers) 
 Cho : Right. You know a man named Miles Thorsen? 
 Bodhi : No. Who's he? 
 Cho : I don't know. 
 Van Pelt : Is that enough sugar? 
 Cassie : Yes thank you. 
 Van Pelt : So, Cassie, tell me about the money. 
 Cassie : About a month after she ran off, mom called me, said she wanted to help out, wanted to know how Hansel was doing. She loves us so much, blah, blah, blah. I told her to go to hell, and I hung up. 2 days later, I got a letter with $5,000 in cash inside. 
 Van Pelt : Any message? 
 Cassie : "With love, mom." That was it. What was I supposed to do, give it to the police? 
 Van Pelt : Actually, yes. 
 Cassie : Well, I didn't. We really needed the money. 
 Van Pelt : Did you ever tell your dad about the money. 
 Cassie : No. 
 Van Pelt : How often did she send you money? 
 Cassie : $5,000 every month. 
 Van Pelt : Did you ever write back to her? 
 Cassie : No. 
 Lisbon : I like her for this. 
 Jane : How so? 
 Lisbon : She despises mom. (door opens) Mom's got $1 million stolen dollar, gets in contact secretly. Do the math. 
 Jane : Maybe. 
 Lisbon : No? What's your take? 
 Jane : I'd be guessing. Could be anybody. 
 Lisbon : Not anybody. You didn't do it. I didn't do it. You're distracted. You're thinking about Bosco and Red John. Focus on the job at hand. 
 Jane : You're glad Bosco has the Red John case, aren't you? 
 Lisbon : Bosco is good agent. He's as good as they come. It might not be such a bad thing that we're off the case for a while. We got too close. 
 Jane : Is that what your shrink tells us? 
 Lisbon : Everybody tells me that. 
 Jane : But your shrink didn't tell you that, didn't he? Okay, may—maybe you're right. Maybe—maybe that's the truth. Maybe we did get a little too close. I'm not so sure. But I'll think about it. 
 Lisbon : Liar. I've got a deposition. See that box ever there? (slaps leg) It's got Monica Dunninger's possessions in it. Go through it, see what you can see. 
 Jane : Yes, ma'am... Uh, who wants to come with me out to Twenty Palms to catch the killer? 
 Rigsby : Did Lisbon okay this? 
 Jane : Of course. 
 Rigsby : What is this place? 
 Jane : Guess. 
 Cho : Miles Thorsen's house. 
 Jane : Exactly. 
 Rigsby : Who's Miles Thorsen? 
 Jane : I have no idea. 
 Rigsby : Isn't that your number? 
 Jane : Uh, yeah, that's my number. That's in case the killer gets here before us. That way, he'll call us. Who's that over there? 
 (door rattling) 
 Rigsby : Hey, we have no warrant. 
 Cho : Don't you hear someone yelling in there? 
 Rigsby : No. 
 Jane : I heard something. 
 Rigsby : There's no yelling. I have perfect hearing. 
 Cho : I could swear I heard someone. 
 (sighs) 
 Rigsby : Okay, so what are we doing here? 
 (sighs) 
 Jane : Everybody involved is wondering who Miles Thorsen is. Huh? The killer will be double curious. Triply, even. Maybe the mysterious Miles Thorsen has what the killer is looking for, what he didn't find. When they look him up, they'll learn there's a Miles Thorsen who lives right around the corner from Monica. Hey, Presto. 
 Rigsby : This is extly the kind of stuff the boss was tking about. She didn't okay this at all, did she? 
 Jane : So shoot me. "The fax machine revolution—the little box that'sing our world." why would Monica Dunninger be reading this book? 
 Rigsby : You, Cho, shouldn't enable this kind of crap. 
 Cho : We're not doing anything wrong. What's the problem? 
 Rigsby : Uh, burglary, trespassing, willfull damage to property. 
 Cho : Yeah, door was open. 
 Rigsby : Uh, no, it wasn't. 
 Jane : Of course. 
 Rigsby : What? 
 Jane : Rigsby, you' right. You shouldn't be here. Let us take this. You go find the nearest library. 
 Rigsby : Why? 
 (sighs) 
 Jane : Your punishment for being a wuss is I'm not gonna tell ya. 
 Rigsby : Oh, come on. 
 Jane : Nope, I'm not gonna tell you. 
 Rigsby : Fine. Fine. Whatever. Oh, ho! (door opens and closes) 
 Jane : Call when you're there. 
 Cho : So what's the gag? 
 Jane : Oh, there's no gag. I solved the case. 
 Cho : I thought you already did that. I thought that's why we're waiting here. 
 Jane : Nope. This is, uh... Well... this is more of a fishing expedition. You know, maybe we get a bite Maybe we don't. That's the fun of it. We just sit back, relax, dangle our feet in the water. 
 Jane : This guy predicted that by the year 2000, every American household will have a fax machine. Can you believe that? I had a fax machine. You? 
 Cho : Yeah. 
 Jane : Nostradamus of office equipment. 
 Cho : See, this is why I don't like fishing. We not gonna catch anything. 
 Jane : We have some very tasty bait. I'm very confident. 
 Cho : Did you consider that the killer found the money already? 
 Jane : I don't think it was money they were looking for. I don't think Monica ever her it. 
 Cho : Then what did she have then? And who has the money? 
 Salesman's House : Great bones. Original mid century detail. Great new copper piping that... 
 (door creaks) 
 Jane : Hello. Did you have a fax machine in 2000? 
 Cho : No cause for alarm, sir. We're law enforcement officers. CBI. 
 Saleman : Kimball... Cho. Okay. What are you doing here, Kimball? Is there a problem? 
 Cho : It's an ongoing investigation, sir. We can't give out any details. 
 Jane : Grisly homicide, though. 
 Saleman : Why don't we take a look at that duplex on Royston? Shall we? 
 Jane : That's a good call. 
 (door creaks) 
 Cho : Damn it. 
 Jane : Relax. 
 Cho : He got my name. 
 Jane : Well, you spoke the truth. We are an ongoing investigation. 
 Cho : Yeah, but we're supposed to be working 100% straight. This is not that. 
 (door creaks) 
 Rhonda : I'm—I'm sorry. Wr-wrong address. 
 Jane : Rhonda! Come back. 
 Rhonda : I'm here out of curiosity, that's all. 
 Jane : Well, of course. 
 Rhonda : I've got nothing else to say without my lawyer. 
 Jane : You don't need to say anything. I knew it was you from the start. 
 Cho : Thanks for sharing. 
 Jane : Well, when I say I-I knew it was her, I-I mean, I-I guessed, I subconsciously thought it was her when I saw a photo of her holding large check outside cedars of zion. It was you that stole the $1 million from your own company. 
 Rhonda : Why would I do that? 
 Jane : Well, degenerate gambling would be my guess but whatever your problem is, when threatened with exposure, you made a deal with poor Monica. If she'd take the blame and disappear you'd get Hansel into the best Cancer program in California and pay her a monthly wage to stay gone. 
 Rhonda : That's absurd. 
 Jane : But then Ansel got cured, and there's way Monica was gonna stay gone, not much longer. Then you had to silence her. 
 Rhonda : That's pure fiction. You have no proof at all. 
 Jane : We... we have proof. Wait. Yeah, where is it? Here it is. Yep. (clears throat) This is gonna be good. 
 (beep) 
 (dialing) 
 Rigsby : Yep, I'm here. I know, I know. "The Fax Machine Revolution" is a library book, and Monica Dunninger swapped it. Hold on. I'm checking it. All right. Got it. Wait up. Looks like an accounts book. There's a DVD in it. 
 Monica : "This is just to say that... in case something happens to me, that I swear on the bible that everything in the account book is the truth. I know that I've pretty much lost your love and respect for good. But I hope that this deal that I've made would help Ansel get better and will make up for some of the hurt that I've caused. I love you all so much, especially you, Kessie, even though you think I don't. I'm just so sorry for this mess that I've made. Please forgive me. Goodbye." 
 (TV turns off) 
 Lisbon : The book spells out the deal. Monica took the fall for her boss so that Hansel would have the best possible treatment. Nice work. 
 (sobbing) 
 (whispers) 
 Oh. 
 (Kessie continues sobbing) 
 (imitating Bosco) 
 Jane : Sam Bosco here. CBI major crimes program. Question. How do I go about changing my use access passcode? I go strong reason to believe it's been compromised. Yeah, great. Sure. Sure, I can hold.
