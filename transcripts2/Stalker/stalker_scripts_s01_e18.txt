 Previously on  "Stalker"... 
 Beth : Ray Matthews was just released. 
 He's targeting my life. 
 He wants Michelle back. 
 Ray : We have to make her vulnerable, take away her family here in L.A. 
 I'm being relieved of my command. 
 Jack : So who's in charge now? 
 Vicky Gregg. 
 It wasn't supposed to be like this. 
 I'm trying really hard to give you the benefit of the doubt. 
 Beth : Tracy, where are you? 
 Ray : Hello, Michelle. 
 Perry : What are you gonna do to her? 
 She's gonna bring me Michelle. 
 Run, run! 
 Unh! 
 Vicky : Ben, I want you to escort Beth home. 
 Take a unit with you. 
 Jack : No sign of Ray or Perry. 
 We found Tracy. 
 Where's Beth? 
 She's home. 
 No. I heard him. He wanted you to find me. 
 That was his plan. 
 This was always a distraction. 
 Ben? No! No! 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Weatherman : Chance of showers through the night, but it should be cleared up by morning, paving the way for blue skies. 
 So get out your fishing gear because tomorrow will be the day... 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Turns off TV] 
 [Rattling] 
 Hello? 
 Ray : Hello? 
 Who's there? 
 Uh, I hate to bother you, but my car broke down. 
 Could... could I use your phone? 
 I... I saw that your light's on. 
 You know, I'm sure you're busy, but, uh, if you wouldn't mind, it would just take a minute. 
 Don't you have a... a cell phone? 
 I do, but I... I just... I can't get service out here. 
 Do... do you have a phone? 
 I only have my cell phone. 
 It's, uh, spotty out here in the mountains. 
 Yeah. You're telling me. 
 Can I try yours? 
 How about, uh, I call for you? 
 Who do you... who do you want me to call? 
 What was that? I can't... I can't hear you. 
 If you can just open the door. 
 It's awfully late. I... I don't know if anything's gonna be open now. 
 I... what am I gonna do? 
 I... I got to try, right? 
 Sir, if... look. If you could just open up, I'd really appreciate it. Please. 
 Uh, here. 
 Thank you. 
 It's a nice place. 
 Uh, it's, uh... it's not mine. 
 I'm just renting it for the month. 
 You by yourself? 
 Do you have a signal? 
 Uh... 
 No. 
 Hmm. Well, thanks for letting me try. 
 Unh! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Grunting] 
 How is he? 
 Janice : The same. He hasn't regained consciousness. 
 But the surgery was successful? 
 They were able to remove the bullet, but it nicked his subclavian artery or something. 
 Time, rest, who knows? 
 Have you heard anything about Beth? 
 Nothing. The search went through the night. 
 Roadblocks, door to door. 
 It's all over the news. 
 Someone had to seen him. 
 We're gonna find her. 
 [Cell phones vibrating] 
 The FBI believes that Ray Matthews has crossed state lines, and they will now be taking control of this investigation. 
 We will assist them in anything that they need. 
 Now to give us an update, Special Agent in Charge Bill Wheeler. 
 Bill. 
 Thank you. As you know, every ounce of manpower available is searching for Lieutenant Davis. 
 Jack : So are we sidelined or what? 
 No, but it's kidnapping and state lines, so it's the FBI's case now. 
 We'll work alongside them. 
 We don't know they crossed state lines. 
 The FBI has good reason to believe that Ray has crossed back into Washington state, but regardless, they have the manpower and the resources. 
 This is really good news for Beth. 
 Now in the meantime, I've been required to hand over your case files and evidence to their task force commander. 
 Sounds like sidelined to me. 
 We don't need that tone. 
 I know that Beth matters, all right? 
 Now right now, we can focus on the psychology. 
 We need to figure out where Ray took Beth. 
 There has to be a trail of bread crumbs somewhere. 
 The psychology of abduction isn't complicated. 
 It's all about power and love. 
 Once you have someone within your possession, they rely on you for everything, including their lives. 
 Well, Ray's been locked up for 12 years. 
 He's had plenty of time to meticulously detail a plan. 
 You mean, their future together. 
 Yes. His delusional idea of their future. 
 He'll want to isolate her in captivity. 
 Eventually, she'll come to depend on him. 
 The Stockholm syndrome. 
 Right. So he's a psychopath who's been in treatment for years. 
 What if he believes that he has been cured and that he could do the same thing to Beth? 
 Brainwashing her? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Conditioning her into living him. 
 Yeah. If that's the case, Beth will know it. 
 She'll use his psychology against him. 
 News anchor, muffled : The victim TAU Lieutenant Beth Davis and her likely abductor Ray Matthews. 
 Lieutenant Davis was taken from her home in Los Angeles last night. 
 [Clear audio] Ray Matthews, who was recently released from Seattle Pacific psychiatric hospital... 
 Ray : Good morning. How'd you sleep? 
 A friend of Lieutenant Davis... 
 Egg whites, tomatoes, no cheese. 
 I remembered. 
 I know you like more veggies in your omelet, but it's not like I can just rush out to the store. 
 What happened to Ben? 
 Who? 
 The detective you shot at my house. 
 Oh, the news says he's in severe but stable condition. 
 You don't trust me, do you? 
 It's not poisoned. 
 You know I wouldn't do that to you, right? 
 You knocked me out and put me in the trunk with a dead body. 
 I'm sorry about that, but your friend Tracy, she's OK. 
 You know, you could thank me for that. 
 Why did you kill Perry? 
 Perry became a liability. 
 How many others, Ray? 
 [Sighs] 
 The end justifies the means. 
 What is the end? 
 Do you even know? 
 You and me together like it's always been. 
 Salt. 
 You need help. 
 You are delusional. 
 Yeah. I suffer from narcissistic personality disorder. 
 I'm well aware of it. 
 You can turn this all around, Ray. 
 Come on. Let me go. 
 Take these handcuffs off. 
 Think I might wait till you trust me a little more. 
 I am never going to trust you. 
 I've waited 12 years to be with you, and I realize I may have to wait 12 more years for you to trust me again, for you to love me, but I can wait. 
 I mean, I think if... if we've established anything it's that I'm patient. 
 Wouldn't you agree? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm a little hungry actually. 
 Well, good. 
 This is getting cold. 
 Oh. Napkin. 
 Unh! 
 [Gasps] 
 Unh! Ugh! 
 News anchor : A nationwide manhunt is underway, headed by the FBI, who took control of the the investigation earlier today. 
 Janice : It's 3,000 pages of notes, files, medical records, 128 hours of video sessions with Ray and his doctor. 
 I'm starting in the notes, and you can take the video sessions. 
 Got it. 
 Hey. 
 Move your ass. 
 You know the statistics. 
 We have 48 hours. 
 The chance of finding her is less than 50%. 
 This is a waste of time. 
 We could be doing more. 
 Who is this Vicky woman, and why is she in charge? 
 Seriously? 
 Is that where you're taking this? 
 No, I just... 
 Then shut up. 
 We need to find Beth. 
 Nothing else matters, got it? 
 Ray : If you weren't so feisty, I wouldn't have to do this. 
 Ray, the man who lives here... 
 I saw him. You killed him. 
 I put him in the closet. 
 This has gone too far. 
 I'm gonna get you some water. 
 You need to stay hydrated. 
 [Water running] 
 I... I know you think I'm a horrible person, and maybe I am, but I don't have to be. 
 You have the power to change me. 
 How do I do that? 
 By forgiving me. 
 Michelle, I'm sorry for what I did to your sister and your family, for setting that fire. 
 I never meant for anyone to die. 
 It was a stunt to impress you. 
 I was gonna run in, and I was gonna save everybody, and... and the fire spread so fast, it went out of control. 
 Please forgive me. Please. 
 How am I supposed to look past that? 
 I'm sorry. 
 See? 
 How can I be so lost if I know what I did was wrong? 
 I'm not a psychopath. 
 The psychopathic mind knows no remorse. 
 I'm guilt-ridden for what I did to you, and I can be a better man if you would believe in me again. 
 In time, you'll forgive me. 
 Doctor on video : Tell me why set the fire, Ray. 
 If I could just talk to Michelle myself, I could... I could explain to her. 
 Explain to me, Ray. 
 Why did you set the fire? 
 You knew the danger. 
 Because I thought I could control it. 
 Is that important to you, control? 
 You don't understand. 
 Doctor : Talk to me about Michelle. 
 I'd much rather talk about my sheltered and spoiled upbringing. 
 You know, I thought we were making a lot of progress. 
 Do you still dream about her? 
 Sometimes. 
 What does she do in your dreams? 
 She's crying mostly because she misses me. 
 I got nothing. 
 It's a psycho and his greatest hits. 
 Same here, but Ray's demeanor did change dramatically over the years. 
 Twice weekly therapy. 
 And a steady regimen of antipsychotics. 
 He's taken every antipsychotic pill that exists at one time or another. 
 Except for now, he's completely unmedicated. 
 He's unbalanced. 
 He killed that private eye, bashed his head in over and over again. 
 Have you been able to contact his psychiatrist? 
 He should be on call. 
 I left a message at the hospital. 
 He's on his way to Munich for a conference. 
 You want some good news? 
 I'd kill for some. 
 Ben's awake. 
 He's weak, but he's awake. 
 Vital signs are good. 
 He's gonna make a full recovery. 
 That is good news. 
 Ray : Do you remember the high school trip to D.C.? 
 Oh, the bus ride that took forever, and then we only had one day to see 10 museums. 
 Well, and I wanted to go to the space museum, but all that you cared about was seeing the inaugural gowns. 
 That's not true. I wanted to see the declaration of independence. 
 No. We skipped that, and we went to Georgetown, and we found the "exorcist" steps, and I let you push me down them, and we reenacted the last scene in the movie. 
 Right, and everyone thought we were crazy. 
 Well, I mean, we're not the only ones who ever took a tumble down those steps. 
 Maybe it's not too late for us. 
 You know, I was hoping you would say that. 
 [Pops can open] 
 Ohh. 
 You're good, Michelle, but not that good. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm just cold. 
 Why don't we build a fire? 
 Ray : I'm gonna prove myself to you. 
 You'll see. 
 Things can be the way that they used to be. 
 Ohh! 
 Oh, no. No, no. 
 Janice, come look at this! 
 That's very beautiful. 
 Doctor : Yes, it is. Very serene. 
 I... I like the calm... calm of nature. 
 Where is it? 
 Ray's staring at the wall behind the doctor's head. 
 Yeah. Some kind of photograph? 
 Yeah, but he asks about it over 9 times. 
 Does the doctor every answer? 
 No. He deflects. 
 Is there... is there any update on the doctor? 
 Can... can we ask him? 
 I can't reach him! 
 That's all I got. 
 Hey. I'm doing worse. 
 I'm... 
 He's killed now, and it's only gonna escalate. 
 He wants Michelle, not Beth, and if he... if he realizes that he can't have Michelle, he... seriously, is this where you're taking this? 
 Tears? Blow your nose, get back to work. 
 Heh. 
 Ray : They've got L.A. locked down tight. 
 They have no idea where we are. 
 
 
 
 [Knock on door] 
 Who is it? 
 Hazel down the road. 
 Thought I'd stop by, introduce myself, see if you need anything. 
 You make a sound, I'm gonna kill her, you understand? 
 Just one sec. 
 Ray. 
 Shh. 
 No one else has to die, Ray. 
 Ray! 
 That's up to you. 
 If you so much as cough... 
 You must be Peter Daniels. 
 That's right. 
 Hazel Schwartz. I look after the place. 
 They usually call me to bring out the welcome wagon. 
 I've baked some cookies for you, chocolate chip. 
 I appreciate that. Thank you. 
 Oh, just a little personal touch. 
 I know all the best, uh, hiking trails. 
 I'm happy to show you around. 
 If you need something, some wood or some more cookies... ha ha... 
 I'm just a half-mile up the road. 
 Number 40. Name's on the mailbox. 
 It's very nice of you. 
 Well, enjoy your stay, Mr. Daniels. 
 If solitude's your thing, you came to the right place. 
 Thank you. 
 [Door opens and shuts] 
 Phew. 
 That wasn't so hard, was it? 
 I knew my Michelle was in there somewhere. 
 She left her scarf. 
 Forget about it, Ray. She's gone. 
 No. I got to go give it back to her. 
 I can't risk her coming back. 
 You said if I did what you wanted you wouldn't hurt her. 
 And I won't. 
 You can trust me, Michelle. 
 All right. 
 [Branch snaps] 
 Ohh! Mr. Daniels. 
 You dropped this. 
 Thank you. 
 I didn't even miss it. 
 How sweet. 
 I'm so sorry, but I can't risk you going home and turning on your TV. 
 Excuse me? 
 Ohh! Go... 
 Aah! No, no, no, no! 
 No! Aah! Aah! 
 [Grunting] 
 Ohh! 
 [Locks door] 
 What did you do, Ray? 
 Nothing. 
 I found something. 
 Did you talk to Ray's doctor? 
 No, but I started googling him, and I found this article written about Dr. Jacobs last year. 
 That's his office in the photo. 
 Where the interviews with Ray were conducted. 
 From where he sat, I bet that's the photograph that Ray kept referencing. 
 You think he's trying to get to that place? 
 Think about it. He was looking at it every time he was talking about Michelle. 
 It's possible that it became part of his obsession with her. 
 You're grasping, Jack. 
 Of course I am. 
 Isolate the picture, crop and zoom. 
 Let's... let's do an image search. 
 Send it to Ben's computer. 
 He has the NSA retrieval engine. 
 It's the most comprehensive. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Go... go back. 
 Right there. What's that? 
 GPS data from the matching image should tell us where it was taken. 
 It's Ojai. 
 Only this section of the valley has that particular view. 
 Address puts us at the corner of White Oak and Juniper. 
 Can you run a property title search within a two-mile radius? 
 It's all woods up there, cabins, second homes, a perfect place to hide. 
 There's 26 properties listed. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 Dr. Phillip Jacobs. 32 Sagebrush Lane. 
 We could have a County Sheriff do a drive-by. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think that's smart? 
 A couple yokels showing up at his door? 
 It could be a Christopher Dorner situation. 
 It could explode. 
 What are you suggesting? 
 We could be there before dark. 
 Well, let's talk to Vicky. 
 No. She'll only consider it a long shot. 
 It is a long shot. 
 She'll do the same thing. 
 She'll call Ojai, and they'll send a Deputy. 
 We go instead. We find anything, we give a call. 
 We don't have... 
 If Ray feels threatened, he'll act irrationally. 
 Half of all stalker abductions end in murder-suicides. 
 It's Beth. 
 Let's go. 
 Ray : I don't think we should risk New Mexico. 
 We're only 5 hours from Tijuana. 
 After we get to Mexico, what do we do? 
 Well, we go further into Baja. 
 Are you feeling better? 
 I'm so sorry about the old lady. 
 Tijuana is the busiest border crossing in the world. 
 What about Mexicali? 
 Mexicali? Here. 
 Yeah. We could take back roads. 
 There's less people, so there's fewer chances of getting stopped by law enforcement. 
 I know you're playing me. 
 Am I? 
 I will do whatever you want so that no one else gets hurt. 
 If that means going to Mexico with you and turning into whatever it is that you want me to be, then that's what it is. 
 Fair enough. 
 I'm gonna check out the other car, see if we can't use it to get across the border, and we'll go by night. 
 You know, fewer people. 
 I knew I couldn't trust you. 
 But to what degree? 
 That was the question. 
 Unh! 
 [Grunting] 
 Ohh! 
 Aah! 
 Unh! 
 Ohh! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Stop, stop. 
 Michelle, stop, OK? 
 OK. 
 Please. 
 OK. 
 Please. 
 OK. 
 Unh! Ohh! 
 Errgh! 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Whoa! 
 What's going on? 
 Is this the home of Dr. Phillip Jacobs? 
 He's my dad. Why? 
 The neighbors complain? 
 Dr. Jacobs' son. 
 Yeah. He's out of town, so I brought my girlfriend and some friends up for some after midterm R&R. 
 When's the last time you spoke to your father? 
 Uh, a couple of days a go. 
 He's out of the country. 
 Have you seen this man? 
 No. Who is he? 
 He's a former patient of your father's. You may not be safe here. 
 I suggest you pack up your friends and get out of here. 
 I'll turn the music Dow... 
 Actually, it's not a suggestion. 
 Yeah. OK. 
 This tire track. 
 Wonder if Ray was here, pulled off to the side of the road. 
 He was watching the house. 
 This is the view from the picture. 
 When he saw the house full of college kids, he pulled back onto the road. 
 Looks like he pulled off in this direction. 
 What is that north? 
 Yeah. 
 He wouldn't abandon HS fantasy so easily. 
 No. He'd find another house. 
 [Panting] 
 Ohh! 
 There's too many properties down this way. 
 Wait. Look. One mailbox. 
 Isolated. 
 They're unlocked. 
 She got free. 
 And it looks like she kicked his ass. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Jack. 
 We found them. They're in Ojai in a cabin. 
 Address? 
 26 Old Creek Road. 
 Looks like Beth freed herself, and maybe Ray chased her into the woods. 
 We're pinpointing your location. 
 The task force, HRT, and SWAT are en route. 
 Where is Ray right now? 
 I don't know, but if he sees us coming, there's no telling what he might do. 
 Jack, Beth's safe return is all that we are after, do you understand me? 
 Yeah. Keep you posted. 
 All right. How fast can you get that chopper up there? 
 Let's go. 
 It's getting dark. 
 Let's split up and surround him. 
 [Panting] 
 Janice, you got anything? 
 Janice on radio : Nothing. 
 Copy. 
 [Leaves rustling] 
 [Footsteps] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Rocks and dirt clattering] 
 Beth. 
 Jack. Jack. 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God. Are you OK? 
 [Sobbing] 
 Where's Ray? 
 He... he's after me. He has my gun. 
 You've been shot. 
 We need to take care of that. 
 Come on. Janice, I found Beth. 
 Jack on radio : She's been shot. 
 How bad is it? 
 She's bleeding. 
 There's a cabin about 100 yards east of our position. 
 We'll meet you there. 
 Copy that. 
 [Ray whistles] 
 [knocks on door] 
 Police! 
 Police! 
 Here. Sit down here. 
 I'll take a look. 
 You're lucky the bullet just grazed your thigh. 
 Now I just need something to clean it up. 
 Hey. Thanks for coming for me. 
 You're welcome. 
 You're in luck. 
 I found a first-aid kit. 
 Surprise. 
 [Sirens] 
 Vicky : OK. This is where we stand. 
 We have 3 officers, one of them possibly injured, and one suspect. 
 Set a perimeter. 
 No one gets through. 
 I want two-man teams to spread out and search every inch of these woods. 
 Stay alert, stay careful. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 You want to be the hero. 
 You got that look. 
 Jack : No. 
 No hero here. 
 Good. Take out your weapon and put it on the ground. 
 Now! 
 Slowly. 
 Kick it over here. 
 Unh! 
 Very good. 
 Man : Agent Gregg. 
 We have a body. 
 Get a coroner down here. 
 Tie her tight. 
 It's no use, Ray. 
 I called in our location. 
 Cops are on their way. 
 Ray, what are you planning? 
 Seems our little trip to Mexico is off, and I've got to improvise, thanks to you. 
 Ray, the best thing for you to do right now is turn yourself in. 
 Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's a bad idea, but I've got a better plan. 
 Which is? 
 A tragedy, I'm afraid. 
 Classic tale of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy goes postal and burns down the house. 
 No, Ray. Ray! 
 I recognize how full circle this is for you and how thematic it is. 
 Aah! 
 We didn't make it in this lifetime, Michelle. 
 Maybe the next. 
 [Flicks lighter] 
 Ray, no! Ray, please! 
 Ray! 
 Unh! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Where'd that shot come from? 
 Man on radio : Straight up ahead, ma'am. 
 Come on. Everyone, this way! 
 [Coughing] 
 [Grunting] 
 No! 
 [Coughing] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Jack coughing] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 Beth! 
 Detective Larsen is still inside! 
 Go now! 
 Yes, ma'am! 
 Secure the perimeter. 
 Cover the back, the sides. 
 Make sure he does not get away! 
 [Man shouting orders] 
 [Coughing] 
 Jack. 
 Man : Hold on! 
 Ohh! 
 Vicky : We need paramedics in here right now! 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. 
 [Coughs] 
 Man : Agent Gregg, there's still a body in there. 
 We couldn't get to him. 
 Woman : ♪ give me time ♪ 
♪ to realize my crime ♪

 [Coughing] 
 How's Beth? 
 The paramedics took her to a local emergency room to stitch her up, but she's gonna be OK. 
 Sorry about racing off without telling you. 
 Well, it all worked out in the end, so I'd say let it slide. 
 One thing. 
 How'd you get help here so quickly unless you knew where we were? 
 You tracked us? 
 I had a little help on standby just in case it was needed. 
 Look. It was obvious that you care for Beth, so you were my best move. 
 I knew you wouldn't stop till you found her. 
 Thank you.

 Yeah, we got him.
