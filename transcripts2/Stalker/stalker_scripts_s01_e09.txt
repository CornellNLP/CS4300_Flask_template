 Man : How do you feel? 
 Different man : I feel better. 
 We're out of time, but I-I want you to think about the expectations that you place on people. 
 I think you'll find some patterns emerging. 
 Yeah, yeah. I will. 
 Good session. 
 Yeah. 
 I, uh, I think we're cracking away at your anxiety. 
 Good. Yeah. 
 Good-bye. 
 [Click] 
 Phillip, did you forget something? 
 [Click] 
 Who's out there? 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Thump] 
 First, you receive an unsigned sympathy card with a clipping of your sister and then this? 
 Someone's trying to tell me they know about my past. 
 That bear was in a box in my closet for years. 
 How would anyone know it was there? 
 They've been inside my house. 
 Have you called the security company? 
 Yeah, I did. I changed the locks, I got a new code. 
 Tracy, you're the only one who had my old pass-code. 
 I've given it to no one. 
 Where do you keep the information? 
 In my contacts, but it's password-protected. 
 You know this. 
 Yeah. I know. I just... 
 I'm just trying to figure out how somebody got into my home. 
 Well, there's no way they got the information from me. 
 Where's Ray? 
 Has he been released? 
 No. I called the hospital in Seattle. 
 He's still institutionalized. 
 Have you talked about this with your colleagues? 
 Beth, you have to investigate this. 
 It's what you do. 
 I know. I will. I just... it's complicated at work. 
 No one knows about me. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 And how are you today? 
 As tired as I am? 
 Um, Brody, I can't talk right now. 
 Can I call you back? 
 Sure. Is everything OK? 
 Yeah. I just can't talk. 
 I'll ring you back, and, yes, I'm exhausted. 
 Bye. 
 So things are good with you and Brody? 
 Yeah. I mean, it is what it is. 
 Does he have access to your phone? 
 It's password-protected. 
 Brody doesn't even know you. 
 How well do you know him? 
 Seriously? 
 I'm sorry. 
 This whole thing, I'm on edge. 
 Beth, I am here for you. I always will be, but I'm not the police. 
 It's time for you to talk to someone about this. 
 This is scary stuff. Please. 
 OK. 
 Janice : Beth, I have Dr. Adam Lewis in the conference room. 
 He's a psychiatrist, says he's being harassed by one of his patients. 
 You take it. 
 Sure. Is everything all right? 
 Yeah. Why wouldn't it be? 
 You seem anxious, preoccupied. 
 I thought the psychiatrist was in the conference room. 
 I'm sorry. Work hazard. 
 It's fine. I'm busy today, Janice. 
 Can you run point and have Ben assist you? 
 You got it. 
 OK. 
 I didn't see who left it. 
 But you have someone in mind. 
 There is a patient who is fixated on me. 
 She's actually been stalking me for a while now. 
 Why didn't you report it before? 
 I was reluctant. I've never revealed a patient's name before. 
 You're aware of the Tarasoff exception to confidentiality. 
 If you believe she poses a threat, you're obligated to do so. 
 Which is why I'm here now. 
 Tell us about your patient. 
 Perhaps we can determine that for you. 
 It started as a simple crush, one-sided flirtatious banter. 
 She began to dress for our sessions. 
 I dealt with it directly. 
 We created boundaries, which she couldn't keep. 
 She began leaving excessive messages, cards, gifts. 
 There's a disturbing video message in there, also. 
 She began dropping by the office at unscheduled times. 
 Then two weeks ago, my wife and I... Vanessa... we took a vacation to Phoenix, and she showed up at our hotel. 
 Did she make contact? 
 I was supposed to meet my wife at the pool. 
 When I arrived, she had befriended my wife. 
 They were chatting. She acted innocent and surprised to see me, but it was obvious she'd followed me there. 
 How did your wife take it? 
 Not well. 
 I had to tell her the truth of course, and she wasn't happy. 
 She thought there might be more to it. 
 We've been having some issues. 
 Non-related to your patient? 
 Yes. It's a marriage. 
 We have peaks and valleys, and we're in a bit of a valley right now. 
 Why would you keep seeing her after you followed you to Phoenix? 
 Transference is not uncommon in psychotherapy. 
 I thought we could work through it. 
 I did warn her that if there was another violation I would be forced to hand her off to another therapist. 
 So after what happened last night, you terminated her as a patient. 
 No. I decided to come here. 
 Her behavior is escalating, it's accelerating. 
 And you're worried that the rejection of being dumped as a patient could potentially turn her violent. 
 We're gonna need a name, Dr. Lewis. 
 You're justified in breaking privilege. 
 What's her name? 
 It's Claudia Burke. 
 What does Claudia suffer from? 
 Claudia is a paranoid schizophrenic with auditory hallucinations. 
 I wrote you a song. 
 I want to play it, but first, you need to know that it was inspired by your eyes, a soft blue like the ocean. 
 Stop it. No. He won't like that. 
 It's too cheesy. 
 No. No. Adam... Adam likes romance. 
 He needs to know how I feel, so... 
 I love you. 
 There! I said it, and you need to know that... be quiet, please. 
 Be quiet. This... this is very... very, very important, and you're trying to ruin it. 
 What if he just doesn't know? 
 Well, what if he loves me, too, and I'm... please love me, too. 
 Please, Dr. Lewis. 
 Damn it! Stop it! 
 Jack : She's hearing voices? 
 Schizophrenic. 
 Who is she? 
 Claudia Burke, music major at USC until she was forced to drop out due to low grades. 
 Stopped taking her meds. 
 Janice : You have an address? 
 Yeah. 
 Want to take a field trip? 
 Sure. Why not? 
 No. I didn't want to go. 
 I'll just sit here and do... stuff. 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Knocking] 
 Nobody's home. 
 She made sure nobody could spy on her. 
 Door's unlocked. 
 Your case, your call. 
 We could justify entering on a wellness check. 
 Works for me. 
 Claudia Burke? 
 [Muffled voices on TV] 
 We're detectives with the LAPD. 
 Claudia? 
 I'm gonna check upstairs. 
 Claudia? 
 [Engine running] 
 [Coughing] 
 Janice : Jack! 
 [Coughing] 
 Claudia? 
 [Coughs] 
 Claudia? 
 She's still alive. 
 I got her. 
 Call an ambulance. 
 [Coughing] 
 A card and a teddy bear. 
 Did you run forensics on them? 
 They haven't been processed, no. 
 Why not? 
 It's an abuse of power and a drain on department resources. 
 Are you saying that my detectives don't deserve the same protections we afford our citizens? 
 Diane, no one's done more for me... 
 I am responsible for the safety and welfare of all my detectives, not just you. 
 This is preferential treatment. 
 Could be nothing. 
 OK. Who else knows about your real identity? 
 In Los Angeles, one friend. 
 In Seattle, I left no ties. 
 The court records were sealed. 
 The only man who could be doing this that we know of is locked up. 
 All right. I am gonna call Seattle, talk to the detective who handled your case, see if anybody's been snooping around. 
 Thank you. 
 But don't rule out the possibility of a new threat. 
 It's not unusual. 
 Every detective who works for the TAU has been stalked by somebody they've investigated. 
 I'm sorry to bother you with this. 
 After you pushed my background check through the academy, I promised that I would never ask for another favor. 
 It's not a favor. It's a viable threat against one of my officers. 
 Run forensics. 
 It's not a suggestion. It's an order. 
 [Heart monitor beeping] 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Detective Janice Lawrence. 
 I'm with the threat assessment unit of the LAPD. 
 What happened? 
 Why am I tied down? 
 It's OK. It's for your own protection. 
 You're lying. Let me go, untie me. 
 Let's talk first. Can we? 
 No one's gonna hurt you. 
 You're safe here, but you just had a very close call. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What do you remember, Claudia? 
 Uh... I was home. 
 I was about to start cooking. 
 Everyone was hungry, so I... everyone? 
 Yes. Jean-Ann, Billy, Leslie, Ricky, Aunt Melanie. 
 It was time to eat. 
 Undo these, please. They hurt. 
 Where are these people? 
 Home. 
 Yes. I believe I met them. 
 What were you doing in my house? 
 You're not allowed to be there. 
 Were you spying on me? 
 No. I was concerned about you, and I was right to be. 
 I'm the one who found you in the garage. 
 I didn't... I didn't go in the garage today. 
 You left a note in the car, Claudia. 
 You were trying to hurt yourself. 
 No. 
 We found the note that you left for Dr. Lewis, telling him that it was his fault, he drove you to it. 
 It's not true! I never wrote that. 
 So you never left him gifts, followed him to Phoenix? 
 You're not in love with him? 
 I-I did those things, but he told me to stop, and I did. 
 I was being good. 
 Not last night. You went to his office. 
 That wasn't me. 
 Then who was it? 
 The same person who wrote that phony suicide note. 
 I was home. You can ask my neighbors. 
 I got into a nasty argument with them. 
 They don't properly bag their garbage. 
 It creates this cat problem. 
 Don't talk to me now. 
 She doesn't understand. 
 I never wrote that note. 
 I write everything by hand. 
 You have to feel the words. 
 You can't do that with a computer. 
 What's the last thing that you remember? 
 I was talking to Jesus when someone came up behind me in my kitchen and grabbed me. 
 Everything went black, and I woke up here. 
 I thought it was Billy or Tina, but it wasn't. 
 You know, they say it was a stranger. 
 Do people attack you all the time. 
 Usually just with words. 
 This is the first time they've ever left bruises. 
 We investigated Claudia's claims, expecting to knock holes in them. 
 A forensic expert found her bruising to be consistent with a struggle. 
 He ruled out the possibility of self-infliction. 
 Much as I would love to believe I'm not responsible for her suicide attempt, when she's off her meds, Claudia gets agitated. 
 The bruises could be from an unrelated event. 
 Maybe, but we now know for a fact she wasn't here last night. 
 She had to be. 
 Neighbors place her at home at the time. 
 She had a verbal altercation. 
 That would mean someone staged her suicide, tried to kill her? 
 You do know she's a paranoid schizophrenic. 
 Which makes her the perfect pawn. 
 For what? 
 Someone's trying to get to you, doctor. 
 Isn't losing a patient to suicide one of the worst things that can happen to a psychiatrist? 
 I believe you have another stalker. 
 Who? 
 Given your profession, let's start with your client list. 
 Maybe someone who knows about Claudia's obsession with you. 
 Had she ever done group therapy? 
 No. My patients never interact. 
 Do you have any disgruntled patients, maybe someone whom you'd never suspect? 
 I'd suspect them. I'm good at my job. 
 Look, Detective. I have frustrated patients. 
 I have all kinds of patients, but a person who would kill an innocent woman just to hurt me? 
 No. You're looking for someone with narcissistic personality disorders with sociopathic tendencies, someone who feels aggrieved. 
 Janice : Aggrieved, someone who feels wronged, cheated. 
 It's a resentful stalker. 
 Our stalker believes that Dr. Lewis ruined their life, and now they want to do the same thing to him through his patients. 
 I did a search on the Internet. 
 I found this review site called shrinkrank.net. 
 I know it. It's like yelp for therapists. 
 How'd you know that? 
 Never mind. Look. 
 Almost all of Dr. Lewis' reviews are positive, but I've got nasty posts going back a year from the screen name shellacked. 
 "He screwed me up, he ruined my life. He needs to pay." 
 Look at this one. "He's so bad he will lose his patients to suicide." 
 Like Claudia? 
 Almost prophetic. 
 Track down an IP address. 
 Let's get a real name. 
 Your biggest online critic is a woman named Shelly Walker. 
 Can you confirm she was a patient? 
 Unless I know someone to be a threat, I can't disclose my patient list. 
 And there are some things we don't need you to tell us. 
 For instance, we already know her life is a mess. 
 Her license was revoked 16 months ago after her third DUI. 
 Doctor, we both know that people with mental illness often try to self-medicate with alcohol. 
 Is that the case here? 
 She wrote all this about me? 
 I had no idea. 
 These threats are explicit enough to break confidentiality. 
 OK. Um, I saw her over a year ago for a few months about her drinking problem. 
 Is there any way she could have known about Claudia? 
 I don't know how. 
 Could she have broken into your patient files? 
 No. 
 Did Claudia and Shelly see you on the same day of the week by chance? 
 Shelly had stopped going to therapy before Claudia even started. 
 Was there any hint of Shelly's resentment toward you? 
 No. We worked on her codependency issue. 
 She didn't think her marriage worked unless she and her husband were drinking together. 
 She didn't want it to fail, but she also desperately wanted to stop drinking. 
 I take it the sessions didn't go well. 
 Apparently not, but I thought we got to the root of her problem. 
 The last time I saw her, she was going into rehab. 
 I got this. 
 What do you mean? 
 I'll do the talking. 
 This power struggle thing is very one-sided. 
 That's because you outrank me. 
 Well, Janice outranks me. I don't have a problem being under her. 
 So she was on top. 
 Oh, that's just rude. 
 Is this thing with us about Janice? 
 It happened once. 
 Is Janice why you don't like me? 
 Because that's just petty. 
 I'm Detective Caldwell, this is Detective Larsen. 
 Is Shelly Walker home? 
 I have no idea where she is. 
 We separated over a year ago. 
 While she was in rehab? 
 Shelly never went to rehab. I did. 
 When I came back sober, she couldn't stand it, said if I loved her I'd drink with her. 
 Then I tried to get her sober, and she hated me for it. 
 Did Shelly ever talk to you about her therapist Dr. Lewis? 
 No, not really. 
 Ben : Are you sure? 
 We have reason to believe she blamed him for her problems. 
 She wasn't in good shape, all right? 
 She blamed everyone. 
 I wish her well, you know, but, yeah, she hated that guy. 
 So this woman who's stalking you, she isn't going to go Glenn Close on me, is she? 
 What? 
 Glenn close, "Fatal"... never mind. 
 Vanessa, you know I can't talk about my work. 
 I was making a joke, and being stalked doesn't count as work. 
 [Thump] 
 What was that? 
 Uh, someone downstairs. 
 Stay here. 
 Is it her? 
 Call 911. 
 You forgot to put it back on the cradle. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 My cell's downstairs. 
 When did you get a gun? 
 It's legal. It's to defend myself and you. 
 Stay here. 
 [Thud] 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 [Footsteps] 
 [Door squeaking] 
 Aah! 
 You could have killed me. 
 I... 
 
 
 
 Shelly initiated her stalking by going after Dr. Lewis' patients. But she failed with Claudia's suicide, and this isn't a person who takes failing gracefully. It triggered an escalation. Now she's going after Dr. Lewis directly. 
 Did you find out how she got in? 
 There's no sign of forced entry. 
 Are you sure you set the alarm before you went to bed? 
 Yes. 
 [Slurred] You don't always remember. 
 I set it. 
 Mrs. Lewis, are you OK? 
 I gave her a sedative. She was upset. 
 Well, you did nearly shoot me. 
 I suggest you check in to a hotel until we can locate Shelly. 
 Fine. I'll go pack. 
 Adam : I'll come with you. 
 She invades his home but doesn't make contact. 
 Nothing's missing. 
 Why did she come here? 
 To terrorize, put pressure on the marriage. 
 The attempt on Claudia's life was made to look like a suicide. 
 She wanted to make him feel like he had failed his patient. 
 She's attacking every aspect of his life... first professional and now personal. 
 Beth : I touched everything, so you'll need my elimination prints, and this is postmarked Seattle. 
 I'll let you know as soon as I have something. 
 [Knock on door] 
 This a bad time? 
 What case was that? 
 It's nothing. 
 What do you need? 
 Just checking in. How are you? 
 You OK? 
 I'm fine. Why? 
 Nothing. I mean, usually, you micromanage every aspect of every case, and today, you're not is all. 
 It's called delegating, Jack. 
 Have you, uh, located Shelly Walker yet? 
 So you're up to speed? Good. 
 I ran Shelly Walker through every database we have access to. 
 She just popped up on the automated F.I. System. 
 You found a field interview card on her? 
 What was she witness to? 
 A dispute at her current address. 
 It's the last place we would have looked for her. 
 And where is that? 
 A sober living house. 
 I've been sober for a year. 
 See? 
 I don't think a one-year chip's gonna hold up in court. 
 Where were you last night, Shelly? 
 At a late AA meeting. You can call my sponsor. 
 She was there. 
 Your husband claims you never went to rehab. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 Jason will say pretty much anything to further his agenda. 
 Which is? 
 He's a control freak. 
 When I told him I wanted to stop drinking, he did everything he could to sabotage me. 
 That's funny. He said the same thing about you. 
 You can ask anyone at new Springs Recovery. 
 When Jason came to visit, he brought a soda cup filled with vodka and tried to trick me into drinking it. 
 What'd you do? 
 I had to cut ties. 
 He wasn't interested in getting sober, and he hated that I'd stopped drinking. 
 I'm getting a telephonic search warrant and having units meet us at the Walkers' house. 
 If what Shelly says is true, Jason lied. 
 She's the one who went to rehab. He never got sober. 
 Shelly was his drinking buddy. 
 When she got into rehab, it just have felt like a complete betrayal. 
 In his drunken mind, he became convinced that Dr. Lewis was the cause of all his problems. 
 Dr. Lewis ruined his life. 
 Now Jason wants to ruin his. 
 Janice : No sign of him? 
 We put out a BOLO on his car. 
 Looks like he went out for a pack of cigarettes. 
 No. He's gone. We must have tipped him off. 
 He must have left in a hurry. 
 And he left his laptop. 
 He knew we'd find Shelly eventually, get the real story. 
 Appears to be a high-functioning alcoholic. 
 Photos of Dr. Lewis at his home, office time-stamped 8 months ago. 
 Ben : Hey, guys. Check it out. 
 Jason had access to Shelly's account. 
 He was the one writing those reviews. 
 This just took a turn. 
 He took them without her knowledge. 
 To get off on? 
 No. This is revenge. 
 He had something to prove. Dr. Lewis took his wife, so Jason targets Vanessa. 
 Where is she? 
 The Bonaventure Hotel. 
 Finish up here. Jack. 
 [Music playing] 
 [Shower running] 
 Honey, is that you? 
 [Gasps] 
 Bill. 
 How much time do we have? 
 Adam's at work as usual. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Vanessa? 
 [Knocking] 
 It's Detective Lawrence. 
 Are you OK? 
 I'm fine. What's going on? 
 Can we come in? We need to talk. 
 I just got out of the shower. 
 We've identified your husband's stalker. 
 You already told me. Shelly Walker. 
 We were wrong. It's her husband. 
 We think he may be targeting you. 
 Oh. 
 OK. Come in. 
 We tried to reach you, but you didn't answer your phone. 
 I must have been in the shower. 
 Janice : The man who's been stalking you and your husband is Jason Walker. 
 The name doesn't ring a bell. Should it? 
 Jack : Maybe this will help. 
 You recognize him. 
 It's Bill. 
 See you next week. 
 Good-bye. 
 Thank you, doctor. 
 We met as volunteers at a homeless shelter downtown. 
 Bill... I mean, Jason was the best-looking guy there. 
 He was charming, funny. 
 All the women flirted with him, so it was nice when he asked for my number. 
 You were flattered. Things have been tough between you and Dr. Lewis for a while? 
 Our marriage had gone stale a long time ago, but I wasn't looking for it. 
 I'd never cheated on Adam, but Bill pursued me. 
 Judging by the bed, he was here, wasn't he? 
 I'm so stupid. 
 Did the two of you ever have s*x at your house? 
 Yes. 
 So he had access to your keys? 
 He saw you input your alarm code? 
 Oh, God. It's my fault. 
 Did you ever discuss your husband and his work? 
 Did you talk about his patients. 
 Well, we'd talk. 
 He was interested in why I was so unhappy. 
 I told him about the one patient I knew about. 
 I told him about that woman that showed up in Phoenix. 
 That's how he knew to target Claudia. 
 He used me. 
 I believe he's a revenge stalker with a total lack of empathy for anyone hurt in the pursuit of his goal. 
 The only person he really wanted to hurt, Vanessa, was your husband, not you. 
 Open. 
 Open! 
 [Grunting] 
 Swallow. 
 [Gagging] 
 Swallow. Swallow. 
 Swallow! 
 Swallow. 
 [Gagging] 
 [Coughs] 
 What did you just give me? 
 Just a few sleeping pills I stole from your wife while I was having s*x with her. 
 Turn around. Get on your knees. 
 Get on your knees! 
 Now let's get this over your head, shall we? 
 Wait. You don't have to do this. 
 Oh, I'm not doing anything. 
 You're gonna do it, doctor. 
 You know the suicide rate for psychiatrists is extremely high? 
 When you fall asleep, you're gonna slump forward, and then the wait is going to tighten the noose around your neck. 
 Janice : Any sign of Dr. Lewis? 
 Ben : Not yet. I've been calling. 
 Where's the wife? 
 In her room with hotel security. 
 Send a Uni to Dr. Lewis' office. 
 We're close. We're headed there now. 
 Police know who you are. 
 They'll know that you did this. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 See, you're not well. 
 You've been stressed. You have a stalker. 
 That will do it, and then you rejected her, and she tried to kill herself, and now you find out your wife is having an affair. 
 Go ahead. Ask her. She'll tell you. 
 She's really good in bed, too. 
 Passionate and hungry, all those things an unhappy marriage brings. 
 Everyone will know that you killed yourself because you're a failure as a husband and as a psychiatrist. 
 Ben : Dr. Lewis' car is still in the parking lot along with a late model sedan registered to Jason Walker. 
 I got the building manager to give me the keys. 
 Your case, your call. How you want to play it? 
 [Patient light clicks] 
 Hi. I'm here to see Dr. Lewis. 
 I have an appointment. 
 He's not here. 
 Oh. Will he be back soon? 
 I can wait. 
 No. He's not coming back. 
 You need to leave. 
 Don't move. 
 Man : Go. 
 Call an R.A. Unit. 
 He's breathing. I need an R.A. Unit now. 
 OK. Dispatch, 2819. 
 Code 4. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Music playing] 
 Dr. Lewis is awake. He's gonna be fine. 
 He's with his wife. 
 Is that good thing? 
 Relationships are complicated. 
 Drinks on me. What do you say? 
 Sure. 
 Yeah. As long as you're buying. 
 You guys have fun. See you tomorrow. 
 Jack : Are you OK? 
 Yeah. I just have some work to catch up on. 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. 
 You're hovering. 
 I just had a really hard day, Jack, that's all. 
 I'm not a psychiatrist, but if you need someone to talk to... 
 Thank you. I'll keep that in mind, but not tonight. I have something I need to do. 
 Rain check then? 
 OK. 
 You actually agreed to a future drink with me? I'm gonna hold you to it. 
 I'm sure you will. 
 Good night, Jack. 
 [Music continues]
