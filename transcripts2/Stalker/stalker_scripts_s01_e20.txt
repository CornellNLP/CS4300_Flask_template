 Previously on "Stalker"... 
 You're not coming back, are you? 
 Why would you say that? 
 My instinct would be to run. 
 That is what you did, Jack. 
 Except I didn't run away. 
 I ran to something... my son. 
 What would you be running to? 
 I wanted to look in on an old case. It's personal. 
 Stan Gardner. 
 Love obsession case. 
 Stan's wife was seeing other men, and he strangled her. 
 I just would really appreciate your fresh eyes on it. 
 I think Stan Gardner's innocent. 
 Where would you begin your investigation? 
 I would start with your ex-husband. 
 He was sleeping with the victim. 
 Janice : When you first filed a report against your husband Darren Tyler 3 months ago, he was harassing you over your breakup. 
 Why are you stalking your ex-wife? 
 Look. I know things didn't end well. 
 I got help. 
 What kind of help? 
 I joined a love and s*x addicts support group. 
 Darren has an alibi. 
 Who else could it be? 
 I started to wonder who did attack Pam in her house. 
 The attacker jimmied the window, found the weapon inside the house, and laid in wait for his victim, which is the exact M.O. of the killer in this case. 
 Francine Johnson. 
 You think these two cases may be related. 
 There's more than just two. 
 I found 4 murders with the same M.O. 
 Each victim in all 6 cases had a stalker who attended a love and s*x addiction support group. 
 So we've got a serial killer out there. 
 All of these men were accused of stalking their ex-wives, girlfriends, or past relationships, the most recent being Pam Tyler, who survived her attack, but Francine Johnson was not so fortunate, nor the 4 other cases I've uncovered with great similarity, murders where we presumed the women to be killed by the men who were stalking them. 
 How are they similar? 
 To clarify... 4 cases where the murdered victims' stalkers were convicted. 
 One has since died, two are serving life sentences, and one is on death row. 
 All in the last 5 years. 
 Yes. 6 female victims who all share a common link. 
 Their stalkers all lived in Los Angeles, where they attended s*x and love addiction meetings. 
 Now each victim was attacked in their own home. 
 [Scraping] 
 The attacker entered through a jimmied window. 
 Sometimes, the victim was home. 
 In each case, the assailant used a weapon found inside the home, a house tool, rope, a kitchen knife. 
 The assailant wore a ski mask. 
 Trent : And how do we know this? 
 Vicky : From the surviving victim Pam Tyler. 
 So just the one case. 
 Janice : There's clearly an erotic nature to the attacks, which suggests that the murderer enjoyed stalking his prey. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 [Ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Hey. What's up? 
 Yeah, I have the morning off. 
 Brian showed up yesterday. 
 It's like he's following me everywhere. 
 It's really creeping me out. 
 [Thump] 
 Just a sec, Megan. I think I heard something. 
 Hey. Yeah. It was nothing. 
 Jack : That definitely defines an M.O. 
 Serious hindsight coincidence. 
 Janice : Or a serial killer. 
 Ehh. Oh, that's where you lose me. 
 Thanks for the coffee. 
 Vicky : Detective, why do you take offense at the idea of a serial killer? 
 I'll admit we don't know who killed Francine Johnson, but to suggest a serial killer means that Robbery Homicide arrested the wrong man not once but in 4 previous murder cases. 
 Heh. Amanda. 
 Amanda : Trent's right. It also means that my office wrongly convicted 4 men of murder. 
 It's not statistically possible in all levels of incompetence. 
 Look. I understand that this may be hard to swallow, but we have to be thorough. 
 If all the victims' stalkers attended addiction meetings, that alone is suspect. 
 4 of these cases have convictions. 
 All we are asking is to an open an investigation. 
 You want me to bring this to the D.A.? 
 Trent : Heh heh. Good luck with that. 
 Bye, guys. 
 I'm gonna need a lot more evidence. 
 I commend you, Janice. 
 This is a very compelling argument, but I cannot bring this to the D.A. 
 I need more. 
 Sorry. 
 Woman : Yeah. Yeah. I'm on my way there. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [House alarm beeps] 
 Nice to see you. 
 Hi! 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 Are you waiting for me? 
 Uh, Amanda told me you were coming today, so I had Tim from downstairs call me the moment you entered the building. 
 That's sweet. 
 I just wanted a second before everything got crazy busy. 
 OK. 
 So you decided to come back. 
 Yeah. Someone I respect told me that I shouldn't be running if I didn't know where I was running to, so I listened. 
 And, uh... 
 [Quietly] The other night? 
 Yes? 
 We kissed. 
 We did. 
 And then you ran home. 
 I did not. 
 Yeah, you did. 
 Well, I... I ran because I kissed my boss. 
 It was awkward. 
 Yeah. Now we're at work talking about it. 
 More awkward. 
 I just wanted to clear the air, you know, see how you felt about it, see if I still have a job or not. 
 Oh. No. You're fired. 
 The reason I took off is because I... I wasn't sure if the timing was right. 
 I felt like I was taking advantage of the moment or something, and I... I wanted to apologize if I... if I crossed the line. 
 Did I cross the line? 
 I kissed you, too, Jack. 
 It goes both ways. 
 Heh. Yeah. 
 Why don't we do this? Why don't we talk about it later outside of work? 
 Yeah. 
 OK. 
 Yes. 
 You're back! 
 Don't get up. I'll come to you. 
 Agh. Go easy with the love. 
 I'm a work in progress. 
 How are you? 
 I'm good. I just got to take it easy is all. 
 It's so good to have you back. 
 I read up on your serial killer theory. 
 How did Robbery Homicide react? 
 Didn't go over well with Trent. 
 It's because love and s*x addicts isn't enough of a connection. 
 We got to narrow it further. 
 There are over 300 meetings in L.A. each week. 
 If we can find one specific meeting that can link all of the stalkers in each murder, it will be hard to argue that it's not a serial killer. 
 Oh, how I've missed you. 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 I hear your board review went well. 
 Thank you for your kind words. 
 I know you had a lot to do with me returning so quickly. 
 I only spoke the truth. 
 They asked me to stay on for a couple of weeks to ease your transition. 
 I'm in Frazier's office. He's on leave. 
 Of course. 
 Have you heard anything more about Stan Gardner's appeal? 
 No, but the judge granted my request to visit him in prison. 
 Have you approached your ex-husband yet? 
 Not yet. 
 I want to hear Gardner's side of the story before I speak to Will. 
 Are you sure you want to take this on? 
 I would think that it would bring up so many feelings. 
 You can always recuse yourself. 
 It's because of those feelings that I wanted to take this case. 
 I've know this man for 15 years. 
 He's not the most noble. 
 He forgets birthdays and anniversaries. 
 He lied to me and cheated on me, but the idea of him killing another human being... 
 I know that feeling. 
 How could you misjudge to that extent, and then the horrible way it plays over and over in your mind, it's debilitating. 
 So you understand why I have to do this. 
 I do, and I have already ordered the rest of the files from Stan's case. 
 I'd like to continue looking at the transcripts with your permission of course. 
 I'd like to help. 
 Thank you, Beth. 
 [Buzzer] 
 Thank you for agreeing to see me. 
 My pleasure. 
 As you know, I am investigating your case. 
 You're investigating your husband. 
 Ex-husband. 
 I know why you're here. 
 My lawyer prepped me. 
 I'm just looking for the truth, Mr. Gardner. 
 Well, it's real easy. 
 My wife was having an affair with your husband. 
 When she tried to end it, he went crazy, and he killed her, and I got the blame. 
 I know that's your story, but could you please walk me through it? 
 Where would you like to start? 
 With your alibi... Mr. Barry Newly. 
 He just came forward. 
 Why wait 5 years? 
 The guy's a drug dealer, and so was I. 
 He was running from the law, and they found him. 
 And this man is a beacon of truth. 
 He's got no stake in this. 
 Why would he lie, hmm? 
 He recounted my original testimony word for word, and he's never heard it before ever. 
 So how did the murder weapon find its way into the trunk of your car? 
 Your husband planted it there. 
 The minute the police questioned him, he started to panic and set me up. 
 My husband was with me the night of the murder. 
 Really? Your testimony said that, uh, he went upstairs while you worked downstairs. 
 Are you sure he didn't sneak out of the house? 
 He was upstairs watching television. 
 I call that opportunity, agent. 
 No. That's where you're wrong. 
 Will had no motive to murder your wife. 
 The affair was over. 
 Will wouldn't leave Sharon alone. 
 He was harassing her. 
 He had ended it with her. 
 No, no. That's his story, but it's not the truth. 
 She ended it. That's when he started following her. 
 That's when he was harassing her, calling her at all hours of the night. 
 Will was stalking your wife? 
 This was never brought into evidence. 
 Because it can't be proven. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Your husband covered his tracks, but make no mistake, he killed my wife, and you know it. 
 Ben : John Murray and Darren Tyler said they have no regular meeting they attend. 
 They go to different ones around town. 
 What we do know is that all the stalkers we're looking at lived in and around the Hollywood area. 
 That narrows our focus to 30, 40 potential meeting sites. 
 Beth : Well, Francine Johnson and Pam Tyler were in the Hollywood area. 
 Two days apart. 
 What are you getting at? 
 The cooling off period between the first two murders was 36 months. 
 Then there's a rapid acceleration. 
 Victims 2 and 3, 18 months. 
 3 and 4, 7 weeks. 
 Now we're two days apart. 
 Which means he's targeting his next victim. 
 He's already done that. 
 If any of this is true, we're about to find another body. 
 [Beep] 
 [Alarm beeping] 
 [Blip] 
 Woman on TV : The LAPD is looking for the male driver of a red SUV. 
 [Floor creaks] 
 [Turns off TV] 
 [Thud] 
 Brian? 
 This isn't funny. 
 Brian? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 [Door shuts] 
 Ohh! 
 Aah! 
 Unh! 
 The assailant entered the house by jimmying this window. 
 According to the security company, the alarm was disarmed two hours before Christine Harper got home, and then it was rearmed. 
 Vicky : There are motion sensors everywhere. 
 He waited for her to come home in the closet. 
 She gets home, disarms the alarm, has no idea someone's in the house. 
 So he knew the code. 
 Maybe he knew her. 
 Maybe. 
 What was the murder weapon? 
 It was a knife in the victim's kitchen. 
 We talked to all the neighbors. 
 Nobody saw anyone entering or leaving the house. 
 We just got word that Christine Harper recently filed a TRO against her ex-husband Brian Mitchell. 
 Where is he now? 
 Unit's picking him up. 
 Agent Gregg, uh, your serial killer theory, we're gonna start digging into that. 
 I would never hurt Christine! 
 I loved her! She was my wife! 
 Who divorced you and filed a restraining order against you. 
 OK. I admit I was a little aggressive in my effort to get her back. 
 You left threatening messages on her phone, you followed her to her work, you sat outside her house, you terrified the woman you claim to love. 
 It was stupid. I... I... I would take it back if I could. 
 I... I... I was upset! 
 Why did she divorce you? 
 It's complicated. 
 Christine and I were polyamorous, but she always struggled with it, and eventually, she couldn't handle it and ended it. 
 Help me out. A polyamorous relationship means how many other sexual partners? 
 No. Christine and I were only involved with one woman... 
 Eva Bowen. 
 And what happened with Eva? 
 She broke up with me, too. 
 Smart girl. 
 Where were you last night? 
 Home. 
 Alone? 
 Yes. You can't seriously think I killed my ex-wife. 
 Did you kill your ex-wife? 
 No! I loved her. 
 She was my primary relationship. 
 Tell me about the s*x in these relationships. 
 Is there a problem there? 
 What do you mean? 
 You attend recovery meetings for s*x and love addictions? 
 Yes. I go to meetings. 
 What meetings do you attend? 
 Mostly at the Sunset Community Arts Center. 
 That's my home group. 
 And did you share about Christine Harper and Eva Bowen at these meetings? 
 Well, yeah. 
 That's the point. We talk about our issues. 
 What does this have to do with anything? 
 Have you ever had contact with anyone at these meetings who took a suspicious interest in your story? 
 Look. People take an interest. 
 That's what we do there. We share our common experience. 
 Let's check on Eva Bowen. 
 She may be our next victim. 
 Get a statement. See what she knows. 
 And what about Brian? We can't hold him. 
 We don't need to. He's not our killer. 
 He's our stalker. 
 He's the one that the killer is targeting. 
 I'm on it. 
 I'm sorry about Christine. 
 I hadn't talked to her in a few months. 
 Can you tell me about your relationship with her and Brian? 
 We dated about 6 months, the 3 of us. 
 How did that work? 
 I'm not familiar with polyamorous relationships. 
 It's cool. No one is. 
 We had a good little thruple, talked about moving in together, but ultimately, it wasn't a fit. 
 Christine was a businesswoman, all about her career. 
 I'm a tattoo artist, a little too alternative for her, and then there's Brian. 
 Tell me about Brian. 
 He's a mess. 
 The guy can't keep it in his pants. 
 He is a total s*x addict. 
 He means well, but if he's not having s*x, he doesn't know who he is. 
 Polyamory isn't just about s*x. 
 It's about living your life with multiple loving partners. 
 Were you aware that he was going to s*x addiction meetings? 
 Yeah, what good it did. 
 Was there anyone in his meetings that took an interest in Brian or his relationship with you and Christine, anyone that stuck out as odd? 
 Oh, yeah. His buddy Jamie Toliver. 
 Who's Jamie Toliver? 
 A friend from his meetings, his sponsor or sponsee, whatever they call him. 
 He was a freak. 
 In what way? 
 He's obsessed with Brian. 
 Brian and I went to dinner a few weeks ago, and Jamie followed us to the restaurant. Hello? 
 Did Jamie strike you as violent? 
 Oh, yeah. He's a scary dude. 
 Hot, but definitely has creepy eyes. 
 Vicky : I met with Stan Gardner. 
 He swears he did not kill his wife. 
 With his alibi surfacing, he's going to walk. 
 But is he innocent? 
 He may be, yes. 
 In the coroner's report, it says that Sharon died on or around midnight. 
 Stan Gardner and his wife live about half a mile from you, 17 blocks to be exact. 
 In your statement, you said that Will went upstairs to watch TV. 
 Could he have left, Vicky? 
 Is there a way for him to get down from the second floor? 
 There's a trellis, but here's where I'm struggling. 
 I heard him at midnight. 
 I checked my watch. The water was running. 
 I... I figured he was brushing his teeth. 
 OK. Let's say that the coroner is off by 15 minutes. 
 It's 17 blocks. 
 At that time of night, there's not many people. 
 Could he have gotten there in that time? 
 It's possible. 
 What about clothing, leather clothing? 
 Does Will own a leather jacket? 
 Not that I recall. Why? 
 Well, Stan's lawyer had every file unsealed this week. 
 Uh, in the coroner's report, there were... there were cuts on Sharon's fingers. 
 She fought her attacker. 
 There was no DNA, fibers under her nails, but there was a dark leather material. 
 Will works in corporate finance. 
 It's all very buttoned down. 
 Not once have I ever seen him in anything leather. 
 Regardless, I think it's time to talk to him. 
 He's the only other suspect in the case. 
 I want to. I just need more evidence if I'm going to accuse my ex-husband of murder. 
 [Knock on door] 
 I checked with Darren Tyler and John Murray again. 
 They reconfirmed they both attended meetings at the arts center. 
 They also remember sharing at that meeting. 
 Beth : Just like Brian Mitchell. 
 That's where the killer's getting his information. 
 Well, two is a coincidence. 
 3 is a pattern. 
 I think it's time we check out a s*x addicts meeting. 
 We're just trying to get background for our case. 
 We're not here to expose anyone. 
 Uh, I understand. I'll help any way that I can. 
 How many meetings are there? 
 Uh, there's 11 every day, but not all of them are s*x and love addict meetings. 
 There's A.A., N.A., C.M.A. 
 Are you secretary for all of them? 
 Heh. No, no. Just this one, um, but we do have meetings all through the week, though. 
 So do you know everyone who attends the meetings? 
 Mm-hmm. If they stick around, I do. 
 We have a strong fellowship. 
 So you hang out? 
 Yep. That's the way it works. 
 May we stay for the meeting? 
 It's an open meeting. 
 You're welcome to stay. 
 Check it out. Yeah. Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 This should be interesting. 
 
 
 
 Hey, bud. 
 Ahem. 
 Uh, hey, everybody. 
 If you want to take your seats, we can go ahead and get started. 
 Hi. Um, my name is Nathan. 
 I am a s*x and love addict. 
 Group : Hi, Nathan. 
 Hi. 
 Uh, as you know, this meeting is a safe space for people struggling with issues surrounding s*x and love. 
 So if you guys could help me welcome our speaker tonight. 
 It's Charlie. 
 [Applause] 
 Hi. My name is Charlie, and I am a love and s*x addict. 
 Group : Hi, Charlie. 
 I thought I'd start by telling you why I feel like I'm qualified to be here. 
 I've always had problems with s*x. 
 9 months ago, I was married to the woman of my dreams... smart, beautiful. 
 Never been happier in my life. 
 Happiness is not a feeling that I am used to. 
 Beth : Her ex-husband's a s*x addict? 
 I would assume so. He was at the meeting. 
 We never got a chance to talk to him. 
 He took one look at Vicky and was out the door. 
 It was crazy. 
 How did Vicky react? 
 Eh, she didn't really say much, but it threw her, I could tell. 
 Who runs these meetings anyway? 
 Secretary is Nathan Grant. 
 Ben is running background on him and others. 
 So how you, uh, doing this morning? 
 Good. How you doing this morning? 
 You making fun of me? 
 No. You seem very serious. 
 I'm just asking. 
 So we're... we're good, right? 
 Yeah. I mean... oh, are we talking about the conversation we had yesterday? 
 We never talked about it yesterday. 
 Hey. We found Jamie Toliver. 
 He's in your office. 
 Great. 
 Duty calls. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks for coming over. 
 Um, come on in. 
 Thanks. 
 Is your sister here? 
 No. She's in Laguna on business. 
 It's only me. 
 How's your dad? 
 I didn't ask you here to talk about my dad. 
 I know. 
 Let's talk. 
 Jamie : What am I doing here? 
 Beth : What's your relationship with Brian Mitchell? 
 He's a friend. 
 You know him from your meetings? 
 It's an anonymous program. 
 Not today it's not. 
 Answer the question. 
 He's a friend I met in the program. 
 Are you obsessed with him? 
 No. 
 Not what we hear. 
 Brian's ex-wife Christine was murdered two nights ago. 
 Yeah, yeah. I heard that. 
 Where were you two nights ago? 
 You think I had something to do with it? 
 Do you also know Darren Tyler and John Murray from your meetings? 
 Why? 
 Because they know you. 
 We spoke to them, and they described you as odd and weird. 
 Don't forget shady. 
 Did you know Francine Johnson? 
 No, but I heard she was murdered, too. 
 What about Pam Tyler? 
 No, and I don't... I don't know anything about any of this. 
 All right? I... 
 How about you sit back down? 
 You know, you have quite the rap sheet... prostitution, larceny, assault with a deadly weapon. 
 Oh, no. Those charges were dropped. 
 They speak to a violent nature. 
 Now back to my colleague's question. 
 Where were you two nights ago? 
 I was at group, and we went for coffee afterward. 
 We left shortly after midnight. 
 I need a name. 
 Nathan Grant. 
 He's the secretary in the meetings. 
 Look. I didn't kill anyone. 
 Will : I went to my first meeting the day you discovered I was cheating. 
 Losing you made me realize I had a problem. 
 I was a horrible husband to you, Vicky, but your leaving me was the worst thing I have ever had to live through. 
 Is that what you talked about at meetings? 
 I talk about everything. 
 It helps to get it out... my marriage, my mistakes. 
 It helps. 
 When you left me, I was lost. Heh. 
 I'd ride by the house, sit outside for hours. 
 I know. 
 I did run a Stalkers Unit. 
 Right. 
 Thanks for telling me this. 
 There's still one thing I have to know. 
 The night of Sharon's murder, did you leave the house? 
 How can you still not believe me? 
 I spoke to Stan Gardner. 
 He is still accusing me, isn't he? 
 He says that he's innocent. 
 And you believe him and not me? 
 We were in the midst of a separation. 
 You were staying in the guest room. 
 How could you think I could kill her? 
 It doesn't matter what I think. 
 As soon as Stan's verdict is overturned and the case is reopened, you will be the first suspect they go to. 
 I didn't kill Sharon, and I am done defending myself to you. 
 Where were you two nights ago? 
 Oh. What are you talking about? 
 It's just a question. 
 At the office, working late. 
 And why is it any of your damn business? 
 You've lost your mind. 
 I'm sorry I even came. 
 Janice : We wanted to talk to you about Jamie Toliver. 
 Nathan : Jamie. He didn't do something stupid and get himself thrown into jail again, did he? 
 How well do you know him? 
 Pretty well. We sit in group together. 
 I mean, I wouldn't say that we're friends. 
 Maybe acquaintances is the better word. 
 He was at group two nights ago? 
 He was. 
 And you met him for coffee afterwards? 
 Yeah. We ran into each other at a place just down the street, talked for a little while. 
 And how long were you there? 
 I wasn't there for too long. 
 I left a little before 10:00. 
 You're sure? 
 Yeah. I was home in time to catch the 10:00 news. 
 Beth : One of them's lying about the timeline. 
 What'd you find out about Nathan Grant? 
 Ran a background check. He's totally clean. 
 Solid alibis. 
 Jamie is the one with the rap sheet. 
 Let's bring him in. 
 Jack : Already on it. 
 Just got the Ramey warrant from Judge Abbot. 
 Let's ping Toliver's cell phone. 
 Looks like he's somewhere in Hollywood between Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard, Vine and Los Palmas. 
 That's near Eva Bowen's tattoo shop. 
 He's going after Eva just like he did Christine. 
 I'll have officers meet you at the scene. 
 Hey. I'm, uh, looking for Eva. 
 She's in the back. She'll be out in a minute. 
 [Heavy metal playing] 
 Um... 
 No. It's fine. We're old friends. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I wanted to talk. 
 You can't be in here. Get out! 
 Hey, chick... what did you tell the police? 
 Nothing. They asked about Brian. 
 Said nothing about me? 
 I told them that the two of you were friends and they should talk to you about him. 
 They think he killed Christine. 
 No. Now they think I did. 
 Did you? 
 Ugh! 
 Aah! 
 Call the police! Aah! Aah! Aah! 
 Up against the wall! 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't kill Christine. 
 I wasn't trying to kill Eva. 
 Well, we looked into your alibi, Jamie. 
 It didn't check out. 
 I told you I was with Nathan that night. 
 Nathan says your coffee date ended early. 
 He was home by 10:00. 
 Well, he was lying. 
 Which would have given you plenty of time to break into Christine's house and kill her. 
 You can't hold me here. 
 Where's your proof that I killed anyone? 
 Well, I... I'm gonna go with this. 
 What the hell is that? 
 We found that in the backseat of your car. 
 I've never... I've never seen this before. 
 All right. You're right. I have some issues, but I didn't kill Christine. 
 What do you think? 
 I don't know. It's too easy. 
 I mean, our killer is methodical, brilliant. 
 He managed to avoid detection for 5 years. 
 He would never leave a piece of evidence just lying out there in the open. 
 There's no cooling off period. 
 He's getting sloppy. 
 Mmm. I think that Jamie's being set up. 
 Then who's doing it? 
 [Door opens] 
 I checked with Will Hilton's company. 
 He was not working the night Christine was killed. 
 He lied about it? 
 Your ex-husband Will? 
 I'm checking alibis on the other murders, too. 
 So far, I've cleared Jamie Toliver and Brian Mitchell as suspects. 
 And Will? 
 Not yet. 
 OK. So book and hold Jamie for battery until we figure out who killed Christine and bring Will in for questioning. 
 You got it. 
 Vicky, legally, you can't be here when we question your ex-husband. 
 I understand that. 
 Go home, Vicky. We'll handle it. 
 OK, but there's something I need you guys to do for me. 
 Beth : Thank you for coming in. 
 Where's Vicky? 
 We're running point on this one. 
 Is this about Stan Gardner? 
 I know he's coming after me, but I didn't kill Sharon Gardner. 
 No. This is about something else. 
 I don't understand. 
 Do you know Christine Harper? 
 No. Should I? 
 She was murdered two nights ago. 
 Vicky thinks I killed Sharon Gardner and this woman? 
 You recognize this man... Brian Mitchell? 
 Yeah, I recognize him from meetings. 
 The woman murdered was his ex-wife. 
 Where were you two nights ago? 
 Work. 
 We already checked that alibi. 
 Want to try another one? 
 I was at dinner with a client, as in work. 
 We need a name and a number. 
 You're free to go. 
 What, that's it? 
 Yes. Thank you for your time. 
 Yes. Thank you really. 
 Vicky on speakerphone : How'd it go? 
 We placed a tracker on Will's jacket. 
 OK. Great. John from the NSA is on the other line. 
 Hey, John. It's Vicky again. 
 We're ready for that trace. 
 John : Coming to you now. 
 I got it. Thank you, John! 
 Jack : Vicky, everything OK? 
 I've got a trace. 
 We need friends at the NSA. 
 What the hell? 
 Where is he? 
 He's right outside my house.

 Ohh!

 Vicky? 
 Vicky? 
 Vicky? 
 Beth, I'm OK. I wasn't shot. 
 I'm all right. I'm all right. 
 [Will groans] 
 Will. 
 Vicky. 
 Are you OK? 
 He's dead. 
 I'm OK. Yeah. I'm OK. 
 Will's being taken to the hospital. 
 Pulled the prints from Nathan's body. 
 He's been using a stolen identity. 
 His real name is Nicholas Kosta. 
 Convicted felon out of Philadelphia. 
 He's a Jack of all trades... robbery, assault, wanted in connection with his wife's murder. 
 Disappeared 6 years ago. 
 Same time the murders began. 
 Can you tie him to any other victims? 
 No. Just Francine Johnson and Christine Harper. 
 What about Sharon Gardner? 
 Not yet, but it's just a matter of time before... before we do. 
 What I can't figure out is why he came after you, Vicky. 
 Well, because Will talked about me in meetings. 
 Transference killing. 
 He looked at all his victims as his wife. 
 Yeah. He sat in meetings, and when he heard his own story being told, he found his victim. 
 They were all his wife, and he got to kill her again and again. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. All I got were a couple of cuts from his watch. 
 When you get a chance, we'll need to debrief you. 
 Right. Thanks. 
 Beth : Hey. You heading out? 
 Yeah. See you tomorrow. 
 Good work, by the way. 
 You, too. 
 Vicky. 
 I'll walk out with you.

 Did you ever fix the clasp? 
 Yeah. 
 What's wrong? 
 How did it break? 
 I don't remember. It was years ago. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It broke in the struggle. 
 What are you talking about? 
 There were leather fibers under Sharon's fingernails. 
 Vicky, don't. 
 Sharon cut her fingers on the metal clasp. 
 She broke it. 
 Hey. You have got to stop this. 
 No! You strangled her. 
 Come on, Vicky. The police would have checked my watch. 
 No, because you had an alibi. 
 They never investigated you beyond that. 
 So what are we gonna do now, Vicky?
