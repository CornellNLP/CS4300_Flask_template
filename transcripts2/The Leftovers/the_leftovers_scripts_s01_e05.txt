 Thanks for coming in.

 So... where were you two nights ago? 
 Why? 
 Well, according to the hospital, you had a rock thrown at you a couple months ago, one aimed at the G.R. 
 Then they repaid your generosity by buying up your church out from under you, and they painted it white. 
 You, uh, think I had something to do with what happened to that woman? 
 No. 
 Just want to know where you were a couple nights ago. 
 I was at my house with my study group. 
 A few of them spent the night. 
 I appreciate the extra help with Mary. 
 Can you give me their names? 
 Of course. 
 The, uh, woman. 
 Did she have any family? 
 Why? 
 Well, back when I had the church, I used to see her sometimes. 
 She'd just stand outside the way they do. 
 She never talked to me, of course, but... 
 I don't know. 
 She became a familiar face. 
 Do you think I could see her? 
 What, her body? 
 Yes. 
 You do realize you're a suspect, Matt?

 Um... ahem... well, M-Ms. Mayor, uh... 
 I'm sure you're all aware that a violent hate crime occurred a couple nights ago to a member of the Guilty Remnant. 
 While we conduct our investigation, I thought it would be in the best interests of the town if people remained in their homes after 8 p.m. 
 I work nights! 
 I'm sure we can make exceptions if you have to get to a job. 
 Woman : So we have to change our lives because of them?

 We didn't do anything wrong. 
 Crowd : Yeah. 
 I mean, with all due respect, Chief, how do we even know these people didn't do this to themselves? 
 Because you were with them when they found the body. 
 Well, I was with some of them. 
 What are you... you don't even live here. 
 Well, sure I do. 
 And when I moved here, hell, it seemed like a nice place. 
 Oh, are you f*ckin' serious?! 
 Lucy : OK. 
 I think everyone's had their say. 
 This is not a public vote. 
 It's for the council alone.

 Gladys sat right there where you're sittin' right now. 
 I don't know how, but she somehow got word that her son had died. 
 Did she ever tell you she had a son? 
 No. 
 It was over in Yemen, I think. 
 His helicopter just crashed or some such, and as you can imagine, she did not take it very well. 
 She questioned her commitment, she became distracted, and she began to feel again. 
 And there was a lot of mopin' and cryin' around the house, and then it started to happen out in the open. 
 So I brought her here, I fed her, and I invited her to speak her troubles out loud. 
 I gave her every opportunity to talk. 
 She never spoke one word, never broke, just like you.

 Jesus said to his disciples, "Compare me to something and tell me what I am like." 
 And Thomas said to him, "Teacher, my mouth is utterly unable to say what you are like." 
 And Jesus said, "I am not your teacher "because you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring I have tended." 
 And he took Thomas and withdrew and spoke 3 sayings to him. 
 When Thomas came back, his friends asked him, "What did Jesus say to you?" 
 And Thomas responded, "If I tell you what he spoke to me, "you will pick up rocks and stone me, and fire will come from the rocks and devour you." 
 [Chuckles] 
 You want to tell me what that means?
