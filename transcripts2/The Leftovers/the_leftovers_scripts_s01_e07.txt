 This girl is everything, yes? 
 Yes. 
 Looks like you're at about 12 weeks, give or take. 
 If that's a traffic ticket, I can get you out of it. 
 Divorce. 
 Me too. 
 Maybe we should um... 
 Do dinner? 
 I would love that.

 Last night, a woman was attacked in the GR. 
 Your mum's OK. 
 I want you to hear from me first so you wouldn't worry. 
 I shouldn't have cried. She wouldn't have cried for me. 
 I understand it's your family. 
 Going back to them feels comfortable. 
 Because what we do is very, very hard! 
 But there can't be any doubt, Laurie. 
 Chief Kevin Garvey. 
 Thought you went crazy. 
 That was my dad. 
 Will you please shut up? 
 Oh, no. I'm not gonna tell him. 
 Tell me what? 
 They said they sent somebody to help you. 
 Help me with what? 
 Whatever it is, you might wanna keep it to yourself.

 Want to come inside? 
 That was f*cking fantastic. 
 Why, thank you. 
 I usually ignore them. 
 It's the first time they've been out there in a couple of months.

 Work a grid. 
 How do you want us to handle it if we get eyes on him, Chief? 
 Kevin : Do not engage. Just call me immediately. Is that understood? 
 Do you have any idea what he wants? 
 It doesn't matter what he wants. 
 What if we find him in a violent situation?
