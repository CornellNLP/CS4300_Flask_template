 (rumbling) Kevin? (glass shatters) Kevin? (electricity crackles) (screams) (Lily crying) Hey. Oh, hey, big girl. Oh, God. Oh, thank God. (car alarms blaring) Shh, it's okay. Okay, let's go see. Hey. Hey. Oh, my God. Hey. What's happening? Nothing. It's okay. Go back to sleep, sweetheart. It's okay. (water spraying) (electricity buzzing) Kevin? Kev... Kevin? Ah, f*ck. Michael : She's still not answering. John : Wait. Get in the truck. (phone ringing) Hi, this is Kevin Garvey. Leave a message. (beeps) Kevin, where are you? Your truck is here. You need to call me. (engine starts) Don't know where you are. You need to call me. (tires squeal) Are you okay? Evie didn't come home last night. She was out with her friends and they're gone, too. Gone? (phone ringing) (dog barking) (door closes) (dogs barking) (dogs barking) Oh, f*ck. Oh, f*ck! No f*cking cable. f*ck. Okay. (line ringing) Operator :  911, what's your emergency? Did... did it happen again? Ma'am, can you repeat... I can't find my... My boyfriend isn't here. Did it... did it happen? Ma'am, if you've experienced the earthquake... No, no, not the f*cking earthquake. Not the f*cking earthquake. Did it ha... did... Are the people gone? (door opens) Are they gone?

Where'd you go? I woke up in a drained pond. When I crawled out, there was a car parked up on top. A white Mercedes. It was empty. Then I saw another car coming. It was John, the neighbor. His son was with him. I think my phone is probably up there. They're gonna find it. I think I should tell the cops. Tell them what? You're gonna say you don't remember anything before you woke up in the exact spot where our neighbor's daughter and her two friends disappeared from? Wait, Evie's missing? (knocking on door) (knocking continues) This your truck parked out front? Yeah. Putting together a search and rescue out the woods. Gonna need to rig some winches. Think you can help us out? Yeah, sure. Just follow me over here. Yes, I'll unhook my trailer over here. All right. Need help? No. Okay. (crowd clamoring) Ranger over P.A. :  This area is restricted. We need you to stay behind the line. Come in. Go, go. Ranger over P.A. :  Stay behind the tape, please. Whoa, hold on. Ranger 2 over P.A. :  Do not park your vehicle here. There's a table up the road for volunteers. (clamor continues) Jesus. You woke up down there? Yeah. I came up that embankment. That's when I saw the car. You should get down there. If someone else finds your phone, you can say you just lost it today. That's pretty f*cking smart. Thanks. You might want to start at the car and work your way back down. Where are you going? To find the girls. (camera clicking) (camera clicking) Ranger :  Hey. Can I help you? Oh, I'm part of the rescue. I brought the winch in. Wristband. Sorry? I need to scan your wristband. Oh, yeah. Of course. Ranger : We had to close the park down. (beeps) Make sure everyone belongs here. It says temporary, but we just bought a house, so... They told us to keep wearing it. You bought a house? Where? Um... Uh, Stanton. You have an address? It's 41, I think. You think? Yeah. Vega, that's my neighbor. Oh, yeah, sure, John. Want to give us a hand? Yeah. Take that. (megaphone squeals) Ranger over P.A. : Thanks for coming out. We appreciate you helping us with this. You see anything that don't belong, don't touch it. Leave a ribbon, find one of us. Let's go. (dog barking) Woman : God be in my head and in my understanding. God be in mine eyes and in my looking. God be at mine end and at my departing. We are the 9,261. We are spared. All : We are the 9,261. We are spared. Woman :  For that, we are grateful. Amen. All : Amen. All : Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. (no audible dialogue) ♪ Gonna make some formula for you... ♪ Oh... sh1t. Okay. Whoa. Hi. Hi. I heard about your sister. My dad and Nora went to go help, you know, look for her. Thanks. Why are you wet? Do you know how to fix a sink? (chuckles) (faint music playing) That's it. I got it? Yeah. You got it. (exhales) Sorry I bothered you. Didn't know what else to do. It's okay. What? Why aren't you with them looking for her? I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. You don't have to answer that. My sister isn't here anymore. Where is she? When I talk about this to people like you, they just look at me like I'm crazy. People like me? Who don't believe in God. (Lily fussing) I think I just made your sister uncomfortable. You don't make me feel uncomfortable. I should get back. Thanks for saving me. Any time. (door closes) (clamoring) Get back! I'm not telling you again. Ranger :  Make room for these people, now. Come on! Let's go, let 'em through. Let 'em through. Close it up. Hey, step back! Nothing down there. Man :  You sure? Certain. Thank God. This is our neighbor Kevin. Sam and Loretta. How are you? Kevin :  Sam. John : Emily. Their daughters were with Evie. Oh, I'm sorry. If there's anything we can do to help... Hey, they're towing the car up to Austin. Didn't find anything? Nothing came up on the black light. They did pull a palm print off the driver's side window. What? Yeah, the state guy said it was too big to be one of the girls'. A palm print? (clamoring escalates) Ranger : Stop that! No, stop! God, these f*cking animals. Okay, we'll get 'em out of here. No, let them. It's just water. (choir singing) (insects chirping) (chatter) Any luck? No. If the phone turns up, I'll just say I dropped it today, you know, like you said. So I should just keep looking? That's probably a good idea. (truck door opens) Here. Are we okay? Yeah, we're okay. Love you. I love you, too, Kevin. (engine starts) Thanks. (bleats) (faint music playing) (bell jingles) Earthquake? Woman :  Yeah. (bell jingles) What can I do you for? Can I get a fifth of Wild Turkey and a carton of Reds, please? sh1t, forgot my wallet. Put it on my tab. You don't have to do that. Eh, my pleasure. Looks like you got a fun night planned. But you really shouldn't smoke. They're for my boyfriend. I'm enabling him. Ah. Give me your address. I'll pay you back. No, no, consider it a gift from me to your boyfriend. Thank you, sir. I'm Nora. (cash register beeping) Virgil. Virgil. I'm so sorry for your loss. What? Your loss. What a horrible thing. Woman :  God damn it, Virgil, what did I tell you? You want to come in here, you can't do this sh1t. Get out. I'm sorry if I caused any distress. (door opens, bell jingles) (honks horn) I know exactly where your phone is. I can tell you what happened to those girls, too. All you have to do is ask. Smart. Retrace your steps. You're a regular f*cking Hardy Boy. Dipshits, those two. Hey, why didn't you tell Nora about the whole cinder block tied around your ankle thing? You afraid she'll jump to conclusions? I know what conclusion I'd jump to. You're cold, buddy. Cold, cold, cold. Cold. Warm. Oh, yeah. Getting warmer. Oh! Oh, yeah. Warmer. You're getting real hot now, Kevin. Oh, you're on goddamn fire. ♪ We're no strangers to love ♪ ♪ You know the rules and so do I ♪ ♪ I just want to tell you how I'm feeling ♪ 
♪ Got to make you understand... ♪ Don't get in that car, Kevin! You still here, man? Yeah, I just... I lost my phone when I was out here earlier today. Find it? Yeah, I did. It's bricked, so... I was gonna maybe go check with the rangers, see if they needed some help in the woods. They ain't gonna find nothing in the woods. Hop in, I'll give you a ride. No, uh, Nora was gonna come back, swing around, pick me up. Hop in, man. I got you. All right. What's that? Birthday present. Feel that quake last night? What? Earthquake. Did it wake you up? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that woke us. Hand me one of those. You can help yourself. I'm good. (can tab pops) Thought you didn't drink. My daughter's missing. Don't... we live back there. Patrick. John, hey. How you holding up? Open the gate, please. The natives in the camp are restless 'cause we closed the park. You might want to roll your window up. Will do. We're here for you, man. (crowd clamoring) These f*cking people wait for weeks to get in for 10 hours just so they can buy a T-shirt. I think they're looking for more than a T-shirt. Yeah? Well, what are you looking for? A fresh start. No, you paid $3 million for a house that's cracking apart just so you could live on the other side of that bridge. What you were looking for is to feel safe. Man : Hey, what's going on in there? Why won't they let anybody in? What happened to you guys?! No safer here than anywhere else. Of that I am sure. There are no miracles in Miracle. 
 
 (siren wailing) God damn it. (tires squealing) What's happening? Stay in the car. T.J. :  You need to go home now. No, I told you guys what I need. Now move your damn truck. What's he doing here? John :  I asked you to go with me, you said no, so he's coming. Now move your truck. John, listen to me. Isaac didn't do anything. There was a palm print on the car that my daughter was in. Like it was left for me. A goddamn palm print. (conversation continues) Patti : Lucky duck. John :  We have a problem. Now I'm going to take care of it. Looks like you framed someone without even trying. T.J. :  Isaac didn't do anything. John : I don't have time. I'm not hearing that. Jesus, John. John! Hold on. (engine starts) John! John, don't do this. Come on, brother, what are you doing, huh? What are you doing? Hey, hey, what are you doing? I'm gonna go talk to somebody. Who? A liar. Said he could tell people their future. Said something bad was gonna happen to me, now my daughter's gone. Why would he have your daughter? Well, I might have burned down his house. You coming with me? Hey, hey! Why'd you bring me here, man? What? You picked me up. Why? 'Cause you wanted company? 'Cause your friends said you weren't thinking straight? No. Well, you're not. Let me talk to this guy. No, come on, man. Step aside. Hang on, hang on. You think he's gonna let you in the door with that bat? I was a cop. No sh1t. No sh1t. Look, if he knows anything about your daughter or knows anything about these girls, then I'll f*cking know. We'll take it from there. What's his name? Isaac. All right, Isaac. What room is he in? 12. All right, so I'll go talk to Isaac. You wait here. All right. All right. Wait here. Gosh, you sure defused that bomb. Nice work, Chief. My husband Neil... sorry, my ex-husband... Was engaging in some pretty suspicious texting activity and then he would leave late at night to go to the office. "To the office." That was the best he could do. I mean, put some f*cking originality into it, Neil. So I followed him to a motel just like this one. Sat in the car. I watched while he walked into the room. And I considered turning around and going back home. I was scared, Kevin. Scared that when I caught him, it'd be over. He would leave me. But I needed to see,  to know. So got out of my car, walked over to the room and I took a peek. There was Neil buck naked and some woman. She had her shirt on. That was it. She was taking a sh1t on him, Kevin. A sh1t. I was married to that asshole for 17 years  and never once did he ask me to sh1t on him. (knocking) Laurie ever tell you about that? She was my shrink for a long time. Security. I always wondered whether that doctor-patient confidentiality thing was bullshit. (knocking) Security. Can you please open your door? Is Isaac here? Who? (thumping) John : Open this door! I know you're in there! You used your credit card! John! (glass shatters) Open this... (gunshot) Oh, sh1t. (John shouting) (glass shatters) Let go of me! He knows where she is! Where is she? Enough of this sh1t, John! Hey, relax. It's okay. Relax? Get the f*ck out of my room! You've been shot. You've been shot. Where is she? Who? My daughter. Whatever you're looking for, it ain't here. Now get the f*ck out of my room, John Murphy. Go. Let's do that. Let's go back. Isaac :  Go. (whispering) Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Isaac :  Ain't nothing more dangerous  than a man who don't believe in nothing. Hey. We gotta get you to a hospital, man. No. You're shot. You need to go see a doctor. No hospitals. You said before you'd do anything to help. Well, help. Hey, I'm driving. (groans) (engine starts) (tires squeal) Hey, babe. I got shot. (door opens) Hey. Hey. She asleep? Yeah. I couldn't find the box with the books in it, so I made up a story. Did it have a happy ending? What kind of a sick f*ck do you think I am? Where's Dad? He's still out there looking. You're 18, right? 17. Close enough. (dog barking) Why do you think he sleepwalks? I don't know. Stress? The town was losing its sh1t and he was in charge. And I guess now he needs to lose his sh1t, too. He's not in charge anymore. And we left town. Wherever you go, there you are. Young lady, you are wise. (pours whiskey) Michael, the boy next door... he says his sister departed. She didn't depart. How do you know that? Because I do. How? Before I worked in benefits in the DSD, they had me in the fraudulent claims department. People who said their family members departed so they could get a check. My beat was secondary departures. I got assigned this woman. She and her husband used to walk their dog together every morning. It was about a year and a half after the 14th. And as they're walking out the front door, the phone rings. So she goes back inside and she picks it up. Talks for like 30 seconds and hangs up. When she steps back outside, there's the dog, leash just lying on the ground, husband's gone. So the logical explanation is that he went where 140 million other people went... Into thin air. I found that fucker in Puerto Rico. He was careful. He made small withdrawals from their bank account for six months so he could build a nest egg, and then he just chose his moment and he ran. Why? Because he had the greatest scapegoat in the history of civilization. The Sudden Departure was a one-time-only event. The flood happened three years ago on October 14th, and the ark took on all the animals it needed. Why in God's name would it take on any more? Kevin : All right. (groans) Easy, easy. Lay back. Lay back. Easy. Just lie back, lie back. (groans) You're all right. What was it? .22 through the door. Erika : It's not that deep. I can see the bullet. I think I should just go. You're good here. What's that? It's for the pain. No, no, I don't want to be knocked out. Okay. (groans) Just relax. That's better. She knocked me out. I thought I could find her. I know. I know. (sighs) (door opens) I gotta go out. Will you keep an eye on Lily? Yeah. Where are you going? Church. Matt :  If they asked me, I'd say lean into it. That's the sermon they need to hear. These people haven't been in this situation. I offer expertise based on experience. But they're not gonna ask. I'll sit there while Winston goes on about Proverbs and the congregation's eyes glaze over. Nora. Is it real? What? Is this place real? I'm not sure I understand the question. One of the only reasons we chose this place  was because you said it was special. You told us we would feel safe here. Now I'm waking up to f*cking earthquakes and missing teenagers. My boxes aren't even unpacked and it's the same goddamn thing I left. Mary woke up. What? The very first night we were here. I thought I was dreaming, but she was back. I said we should go to the hospital, but Mary, she just wanted to talk. The last thing she remembered was the accident, so I told her everything that happened since. We talked for hours. And we cried. Until we fell asleep in each other's arms. (choir singing) And when I woke up, she was like this again. For some reason, the people in this town don't want me to talk about what happened. Maybe they don't believe me. Maybe you don't. But I got a glimpse, a moment. And every day since I've wondered if it's ever gonna happen again. If I'll get her back for good this time. But the one thing I've never wondered is if it's real. It's real. (crickets chirping) (dog barking) You left this at our house. Thanks. What are those for? There's one on our house, too. _ Before park services took over, some people from the government came by to every house to make sure it was true. That no one was gone. Oh. Do you want to come in? I can't. I'm watching Lily. You alone? Mm-hmm. Me, too. (crying) John said he burned that guy's house down. The guy who shot him. Well, then I guess they're even now. (metal clanging) Burning down houses is new. Usually he just gives a warning. Warning for what? (sighs) When people found out about what happened here, there was a lot of confusion. And then there were claims,  claims that were untrue. John was in at the time. But when he came home and saw what was going on... he wasn't having it. "There are no miracles in Miracle." He gave you the speech? Mm-hmm. Evie was a miracle. She came too early. 24 weeks. You know, a lot of people don't know that twins can be born two months apart. Michael, he stayed put, but Evie, she couldn't wait to get started. She was one pound, one ounce. (chuckles) Now look at her. I know what people are saying. They're saying that something bad happened. She's... playing a joke and she's giggling in the woods. No one would ever want to hurt Evie. She would never want to hurt anybody else. She's better than that. She is exceptional. Exceptional. Just like this town. Things are gonna change now. I like them, the Murphys. They're exciting. And that Erika is something, huh? Gets the call her husband's been f*cking shot. She just pulls the bullet out, no questions asked. That's real commitment. That's trust. That's love. Not like what you've got. What you've got, Kevin, isn't love. It's damage control. Your family blew up, Nora's family blew up. And now you're all just clinging on to each other 'cause you need to cling on to something. That's why she bought the house. She didn't really care whether you wanted to or not. Her money, her choice. That must have been emasculating. And you... Jesus. If you loved them, you'd trust them enough to tell them about me. If you loved them, you wouldn't lie. Shut the f*ck up! I didn't tell them about you because you're not f*cking here. I love my family. I love them. Then why did you try to kill yourself? What? Come on. This isn't a big mystery. I was right there with you. You walked out of your house in the middle of the night and you found a rope and a cinder block and then you tied it to your ankle and you threw it into a goddamn lake. Let's face it, Kevin,  there are people who try to commit suicide for attention. And then there are people who really want to f*cking die. Like me and you. I watched you do it. And you did not hesitate, my friend. Plunk. Right into the wet abyss. And if not for an act of divine intervention, you'd be gone. I'm sorry, Kevin, but these are not the actions of a man who loves his family. I don't want to kill myself. Well... (sighs) you're certainly entitled to your opinion. I'm just glad we finally talked about it. Oh... since you didn't seem to give a sh1t enough to ask me, I'll tell you. They vanished. The girls.
