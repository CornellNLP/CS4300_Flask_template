 [Muffled by music] 
 Christine. Christine. Christine! 
 [Baby fussing] 
 She's hungry. 
 [Crying] 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 [Baby grunting] 
 He's never coming for us, is he? 
 Wayne? 
 I don't know. 
 [Crying] 
 I should have known he was a liar when he said I was special. 
 Look at me. 
 Hey. 
 I'm gonna take care of you just like I promised. 
 OK? I'll get a job. I'll find us a place to stay, all of us. 
 [Sniffs] We don't need him. 
 Christine, we don't need Wayne. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I know. 
 [Sniffles] 
 She's wet. 
 Do you want me to... 
 No, no, I've got her. 
 Excuse me, young man. 
 Young man? 
 Can I help you? 
 What? 
 Is there anything I can do... to help you? 
 No, I'm fine. 
 You're sure? 
 Yeah. 
 [Car horn honks] 
 It's my ride. 
 God bless you. 
 Hey! 
 You just go around asking people if they need help? 
 Yeah. 
 Does anyone ever say yes? 
 All the time. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Baby wailing distantly] 
 [Wailing continues] 
 Christine! 
 Christine! 
 Christine! Christine! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 No, no, no. Hey, hey, it's OK. 
 Christine! 
 Christine! 
 [Baby crying] 
 Christine! 
 It's OK, it's OK. It's OK... 
 Christine!

The Prodigal Son Returns 
 [Fingers snap] 
 [Fingers snapping] 
 [Crumples paper] 
 [Sets down pad, rips off paper] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Distant dog barking] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Vehicle approaches rapidly] 
 Sorry. I got lost comin' off the highway. 
 I tried to call you. 
 The battery on my phone died. 
 Where is she? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm closing her eyes. 
 You can't touch her. 
 Why not? 
 Because she's... it's a f*ckin' crime scene. 
 You told me on the phone she did this to herself. 
 No one's gonna f*ckin' believe that. 
 I believe it. 
 I brought her here. 
 I beat her. I tied her up... 
 And then you tried to let her go, but she wouldn't let that happen. 
 She wanted you to pay. 
 She knew if she did this that it'd hurt you... 
 'cause you're a good man, Kevin. 
 If you touch her... we're in this together. 
 Then let's be in it. 
 I have shovels in my trunk. 
 Wait. [Sighs] 
 I, uh... 
 I marked a passage. 
 Oh. OK. 
 What? 
 You should read it. 
 Oh, no. No, thanks. 
 Why not? 
 Because I don't believe it, Matt. 
 I'm sure she didn't, either. 
 Did you ask for my help, Kevin? 
 Yes. 
 This is me helping. 
 Just the highlighted part. 
 It can get wordy. 
 "If I go to the East, He is not there. 
 If I go to the West, I do not find Him. 
 When He is at work in the North, I do not see Him. 
 When He turns to the South, I catch no glimpse of Him. 
 But He knows the way that I take." 
 "When He has tested me, I will come forth as gold." 
 "My feet have closely followed His steps and have kept to His way without turning aside. 
 I have not departed... " 
 "Not departed from the commandment of His lips. 
 I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread." 
 "But He stands alone, and who can oppose Him?" 
 "He does whatever He pleases. 
 He carries out His decree against me, [Voice cracks] and many such plans He still has in store." 
 [Sniffles, sobs] 
 "That is why I am terrified before Him." 
 "When I think of all this, I fear Him. 
 God has made my heart faint." 
 "The Almighty has terrified me." 
 "Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face." 
 Amen. 
 I brought you a change of clothes. 
 [Sighs] Pardon the fashion. They're donated. 
 [Water splashing] 
 Matt : I'd have brought you some of mine, but we have different physiques. 
 Better? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Let's go home. 
 Man on radio : ATFEC agents exchanged fire with Gilcrest before he staged a daring escape. 
 A tri-state manhunt is underway. 
 At this point, no other agencies are involved. 
 In business news, at the Chicago Board of Trade, corn, wheat, and soybean prices... [Dialogue fades out] [door opening] [Grunts] Kevin : Hey! What the... hey! Calm down! Ow! Matt : I had to. There was no other choice. What the f*ck did you do?! Aah! f*ck! Aah! Please get the f*ck off of me! I'm sorry! Get the f*ck off of me! Why did you do this?! Matt : So sorry! Get the f*ck off of me! This is a mistake, a mistake. I have a daughter. Someone needs to call my daughter! I'm not supposed to be here! This is a mistake! Someone call my daughter! [Door clangs shut] I'm not supposed to be here! [Pounding on door] This is a mistake! [Pounds on door] I'm not f*cking crazy! Just calm down. Calm down. Stay calm. You're OK. Just calm down. Stay calm. You're OK. Just calm down. Stay calm. You're OK. Just calm down. Stay calm. You're OK. [Knock knock knock] Just calm... [Door locks] [Door unlocking] You gonna behave yourself? Yeah. Man on TV : I had to ask. [Audience laughter on TV] Ten minutes. [Laughter on TV] Man on TV : Do you usually sleep on that side? Well, why don't I go to that side? No, no. I will go to that side of the bed. Balki, I don't mind sleeping on that side of the bed. I'm not arguing about sleeping on that side of the bed. Hey, baby boy. Have a seat. Dad, I need to get to a phone. Jill hasn't heard from me. I got to call... Shh, shh, shh, shh. [Sighs] Quiet... at last. [Sniffs] [Sighs] So you finally f*ckin' snapped, huh? No. No? I'm not f*cking crazy. Neither am I... but I am a bad man, son, and the bad men end up here. Dad, you're... look, you're a good man. I most definitely am not. My intentions are good, but my heart and my mind and my balls, son, the holy f*ckin' Trinity... they all knew. That night 3 years ago, we looked at ourselves in the mirror, and none of us wondered why we were still f*ckin' here. We knew. Of course we knew. You know. I don't belong here. Yeah, you do. No, I don't. Oh, yes, you... I have to leave here. There is no leaving here. Now... Don't you f*cking dare! Do not turn around. No, no, just get the f*ck out of here. Son, I said do not turn around. Patti : f*ck him. Turn around. Hello again. Now, why'd you go and do that? He needs to get out, and you weren't helping, you crazy, dried-up, f*ckin' turd. Oh, f*ck you, you f*ckin' tobacco-stink twat. He needs to stay. Is that what you need, Kevin? This isn't happening. This isn't real. You're not here. It's happenin'. It's real. I'm here. Mmm. You... you're dead. You're f*cking dead. I buried you. Hmm. Not... deep... [Whispers] enough. [Whimpers] Hey, you leave with her... you leave with her. Dad. Daddy. Now, Kevin, shh. Looks like we're gonna be traveling companions. Until then... [Whispers] you should wake the f*ck up. What? Wake the f*ck up! You OK? Yeah. Fine. Where are we? I got hungry. Want a cheeseburger? Matt : Mmm. Mmm. God, that's good. So what'd she say? Who? Patti. What'd she say before she killed herself? I don't want to talk about it. I can't help if you don't tell me. You've helped me enough, Matt. Not you. Them. The Remnant. You can't help them. Yes, I can. I know I can 'cause I'm supposed to. But you need to tell me why she did what she did. You need to tell me what she said. She said... I understand. Understood what? I don't know. Sure you do. Excuse me? If she wanted to deliver a message by cutting her own throat, I'm pretty sure she'd be confident you received it before she did. So what did you understand? Why we didn't go. Why... we're still here. Tell me. Before it happened, the, uh, the 14th? I wanted to leave. I wanted to be free of, uh... my family. Wanting and doing aren't the same. I slept with another woman. Who? I don't know her name. She, uh... she disappeared. You were... with her? At the moment of the Departure? Yeah. No sh1t? What happened next? I don't really remember all of it. I think I was in shock. Phones were down, and, um, I was... wearing my uniform. And people kept coming up to me and asking me for help. And I couldn't... or I... I didn't know how. So I got in my car... and I went to Jill's school and I ran inside. She and Tommy were both there, and... they were scared. I just remember the look on their faces when they saw me. Um... They were so... they were... they were so happy. [Sobbing] They were happy. [Crying] And, uh... we went back to the house, and Laurie had already gone home, so... and she was different. I mean, I think we all were. But I just wanted to be with them. And I wanted to hold them. And then I started to lose them. [Sobbing] One by one. It's not your fault. Yes, it is. It is. [Sniffles] 
 
 [Door opens] [Turns off water] [Man crying] Oh... [Sobbing quietly] [Knocks on door] Hey, you OK? [Panting] [Mumbling] Jesus Christ. Just sitting here. Too many woes. Listen, don't move. Please, what's your name? Kevin. You need help. Kevin. No, Kevin, Kevin, I'm gonna be dead in a minute. There's no help for me. [Wayne grunts] So, please, don't leave me alone. [Wayne sighs] Sure. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. I'm right here. Thank you. Will you do something for me? A favor... stranger to stranger? Will you... will you make a wish? A what? I think I may be a fraud. But... but if... if I'm not, I can give you anything you want... and... [groans]... that will mean I was real. Let me do this f... for you before I go. Make a wish. You don't have to say it out loud. Just think it. Oh. Granted. [Running footsteps approach] Man : ATFEC! Get down! Get the f*ck down! Now! Get on the ground now! Hurry up! Get down! Stay the f*ck down! Let's go! Come on, turn around! Let's go! Stay down! Go! [Handcuffs clicking] [Sirens] [Police radio chatter] What did he say to you? Uh... just asked me my name. That's it? Yeah, that's it. Talk to you about Russia? No. Make any physical contact with you? Why? Did he? No. [Siren] Who was he? [Sighs] Just another asshole who thought he was God. Matt : Excuse me. This man did nothing wrong. We were just having lunch, and he's a police officer, a chief. You're a cop? Yeah. Why didn't you say so? I'm off-duty. Where you from? New York, uh, Mapleton. OK, we're good here, Chief. Thanks for your cooperation. Go on home to Mapleton. Man : Stop, now! You... [Brakes screech] [Gunshot] Hey! Drop the gun! Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's OK. Calm down. Drop the gun. [Panting] What's your name? What? Drop the gun. We can talk about whatever you want to talk about. Listen, I'm a cop. Do you... do you see what they did?! It's all right. Calm down. Just drop the gun. f*ck you! [Distant shouting, gunfire] Hey! Woman : I'll kill you, fucker! [Distant gunfire] Hey! Kevin! [Distant glass shattering] Kevin : Jesus Christ. Can you hear me? What happened? What happened? What the f*ck did you people do? She's hurt! She wants to be f*ckin' hurt! [Distant gunfire and screaming] What happened? [Distant shouting] [Brakes screech] Man : I'm gonna kill you! ♪ Jesus. Lucy. Lucy! You all right? You were right. You were right. [Distant gunfire] Dennis : Please! Go back to your homes, for your own safety! Dennis! Chief! They have not... Where the f*ck is everybody?! I can't stop them! They left! Give me a f*ckin' gun. [Sighs] Where's all the fire trucks? I called them. They want to wait till the roads clear. Well, then you clear the f*ckin' cars out of the goddamn road so they can get in! Chief, nobody wants to help them! Get out of my way! It's their own fault. Listen, go back to that f*ckin'... stay at this barricade and do not let anyone through, do you understand? Go! Dennis : Step back! Hold it. Hold this f*ckin' line. Step the f*ck back! How dare you?! [Crying] Aah! Oh! [Groans] Hey, I'll get you somewhere safe. I'll get you somewhere safe. [Crying] J... Ji... Huh? Jill! [Dialogue muted] [Jill coughing] You OK? It's all right. It's all right. Nora  (voice-over): "Dear Kevin, I need to say good-bye to someone I care about, someone who's still here, so I'm saying it to you. You were good to me, Kevin, and sometimes when we were together, I remembered who I used to be before everything changed. But I was pretending, pretending as if I hadn't lost everything. I want to believe it can all go back to the way it was.  I want to believe that I'm not surrounded by the abandoned ruin of a dead civilization. I want to believe it's still possible to get close to someone... but it's easier not to. It's easier because I'm a coward and I couldn't take the pain, not again. I know that's not fair, Kevin. You've lost so much, too, and you're strong. You're still here. But I can't be, not anymore. I tried to get better, Kevin. I didn't want to feel this way, so I took a shortcut. But it led me right back home, and do you know what I found when I got there? I found them, Kevin, right where I left them. Right where they left me. It took me 3 years to accept the truth, but now I know there's no going back, no fixing it. I'm beyond repair. Maybe we're all beyond repair. I can't go on the way I'm living... but I don't have the power to die. But I have to move towards something. Anything. I'm not sure where I'm going, just away. Away from all this. I think about a place where nobody will know what happened to me. But then I worry I'll forget them. I don't ever want to forget them. I can't. They were my family. I think I loved you, Kevin. Maybe you loved me, too. I wish I could say this to you instead of writing it. I wish I could see you one last time to thank you and wish you well and tell you how much you mean to me. But I can't. Like I said, I'm a coward. So, wish me luck. Heh! [Sniffles] I think I'm going to need it. Love, Nora." Hi. [Baby cooing] [Voice trembles] Look what I found.
