 We convened a council of clerics, representatives of most world religions, who, as you know, were somewhat conflicted about October 14th and were thus unable to reach any kind of consensus, which, in turn, led us to the scientific community for answers. 
 This document, the findings of your Commission, as to the instantaneous disappearance of 2% of the world's population, some 140 million souls, your conclusion as to what happened to them, why them, and where they've gone, is... and I'm paraphrasing here...

 In fact, I was asked to identify patterns that weren't immediately obvious and address related events like the Chef Anomaly and the Brandenburg Carousel that were, and still are, considered miracles. 
 But they are simply statistical hiccups that we can't explain because, sir, in my opinion, miracles do not exist. 
 Senator : Miracles do not exist? 
 Doctor : Scientifically speaking, no, sir. 
 Senator : Doctor, pardon my tone, but who are you, sir, to tell the American people that millions of mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters disappeared, gone, in an instant, and that's not a miracle?

 It's a damn side street. We can close it for 3 hours. 
 So, what we're going to do... 
 Everything OK, Chief? 
 Your office told me noon. 
 Well, at least that, uh, gave you time to deal with your emergency. 
 OK, parade should end about 11:00 at the park, and then we'll unveil the statue, which I'm told is terrifying. 
 We have to do that tomorrow? 
 Man : Hector's been working on it for a year. 
 Be kind of weird just to leave the sheet on it. 
 OK, we'll quickly unveil the statue, the Girl Scouts will read the names, I'll say a few words, introduce Nora Durst...

 She lost her entire family, Doug. 
 She'll say whatever the f*ck she wants to.

 I still don't think they were heroes. 
 My brother-in-law disappeared, and he was a dipshit. 
 [Scattered chuckling] They're heroes because no one's gonna come to a parade on We Don't Know What the f*ck Happened Day. 
 The DSD has proclaimed a Federal Holiday of Remembrance, and that's what they're calling our departed because that's how we want to remember them. 
 Everyone loves a hero, so we're all gonna have a nice walk through town, have a good cry, and then move on.

 The G.R. isn't a threat. If they want to stage a non-violent protest, that's their right. 
 You were at the homecoming. They walked right onto the field. And then they walked right off. No harm done. 
 They are trying to provoke us. 
 Then don't get provoked. 
 A year ago, these people didn't even exist. 
 Now there's almost 50 of them. 
 They... they bought up an entire cul-de-sac.

 [Applause subsides] 
 The best day of my life happened a few months before October 14th, but I didn't know it. 
 It just seemed like, um, a nice day, you know, all four of us at the beach: my husband, my 6-year-old son, and my 4-year-old daughter. 
 Their names were... are Doug, Jeremy, and Erin. 
 The kids built a sand castle. 
 Doug and I, we just sat on a blanket and watched them work, and it was just... perfect, and... it felt like, um... 
 I didn't deserve anything that... good. 
 Nora : This one Saturday, the winter before that, we all got hit with the stomach flu, the whole family. 
 We were all feverish and throwing up, and I couldn't even get out of bed, and... the kids were lying there with us, and I could feel the heat coming off their bodies, and I remember thinking, "This is it," I was gonna die. 
 I'm not greedy. 
 I'm not asking for that perfect day at the beach.

 Woman : Do not talk about this as if it has something to do with what we have and have not done, as if there is some sort of rule book... 
 Everybody knows that the holy word of God... 
 You're talking about the Bible. 
 We're trying to have a secular conversation here, and you want to talk about God's will. 
 If it's not the will of God, whose will is it? 
 It is no one's. It is arbitrary. 
 It is meaningless, and anyone who suggests otherwise is probably trying to start his own cult. 
 I'll tell you who's starting a cult... the scientists who believe in worshiping their own objectivity. 
 Science. Science always. 
 Empirical evidence always rules. 
 There is no atheist apostle. 
 Einstein said that God doesn't play dice with the universe!
