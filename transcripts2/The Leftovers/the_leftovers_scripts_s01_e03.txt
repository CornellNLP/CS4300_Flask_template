 Why are you here? 
 It wasn't the rapture! 
 They were no better than us! I have proof! 
 Free of charge! 
 She beat her children! 
 It was not the rapture! 
 Matt. 
 Really need to do this today? 
 Especially today. 
 Next time you see your dad, you tell him he's off the hook. 
 I will be sure and do that, Matt. 
 I'm not asking for that perfect day at the beach. 
 Just give me all four of us alive and together. 
 A year ago, these people didn't even exist. 
 Now there's almost 50 of them. 
 Where did they come from? 
 What do they want? 
 You don't even know who they are. 
 We know who they were. 
 I'm trying to talk to my wife! 
 Please come home. 
 Do you even remember what it feels like to care about anything? 
 [Man sighs] 
 This is the story of a... a little boy. 
 I'd say, "Stop me if you've heard this one before," but you have, and I don't really want to be stopped. 
 This boy, he's a good kid; not perfect, but good, and when he's about 10 years old, his mom and dad tell him he's gonna have a baby sister. 
 And the baby sister comes, and of course he loves her very much. 
 But... she's getting attention. 
 His attention. 
 So he wishes... actually... he prays for that attention back and... a month later, he's diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia. 
 [Cooing] 
 And the... [sighs]... cancer eats away at the boy until there is almost nothing left. 
 But he fights it. 
 He survives and... now he has a choice to make. 
 Does he decide that he was punished or that he was rewarded? 
 Will he be angry for having been made to suffer, or will he be grateful for that suffering because... it changed him? 
 This is the story of a little girl. 
 She's 8 years old, and just over a week ago, she's playing in the park. 
 She loves to go high on the swings, up to the point where you hang there for a moment, suspended, before the chains clink and gravity pulls you back down. 
 She's been asleep... in a coma, for 9 days now. 
 Her brain activity is negligible. 
 Her outcome is undetermined. 
 The girl's name is Emily... and so that little boy is asking for attention again now. 
 For Emily, let us pray. 
 Heavenly Father, You invite all who are burdened to come to You. 
 Allow Your healing hand to touch this girl. 
 Fill her heart with Your courage and infinite love for all that you create...

 Heh! Had to try.

 Gambled away his paycheck every other Thursday.

 He went on the 14th. 
 What was his name? 
 Andrew Sasaki.

 Man : We don't discuss personal information about our clientele. 
 Matt : Sure. Of course not. 
 This man, Mr. Sasaki, he was a Departure, and the reason I'm asking about him is, uh... I'm sorry, I know this is personal, but did you lose anyone close to you, sir? 
 My niece. 
 She was 9. 
 May I show you something? 
 [Winning slot machine ringing] 
 This... is Albert Wayne Studdard. 
 He abducted a young girl walking home from school. 
 Violated her sexually, strangled her to death. 
 On October 14th, he disappeared, right out of his jail cell. 
 And this man, this monster, is on the same list along with all the others who left us, along with the innocent and the good... along with your niece. 
 But someone has to expose these people for who they truly were and what they truly did because if we can no longer separate the innocent from the guilty, everything that happened to us, all of our suffering, is meaningless.

 But... I don't understand. You... you said I could stay. 
 I said you could stay as long as no buyers came forward. 
 I... I'm sorry, Matt. 
 I've been trying to tell you for at least two weeks now. 
 Now, you always knew this could happen once you stopped making payments and we had to foreclose. 
 Who's the buyer? 
 Corporate LLC, probably a hedge fund. 
 They can't really remodel, but the land is worth something.

 What?

 I know it's a lot of money, but it'd just be a loan. 
 Things are changing, people are ready to come back. 
 I just performed a baptism this morning. 
 I hate coming to you, but this is our family church, Mom and Dad's... 
 No, Matt, it's your church. 
 They left it to both of us. 
 They didn't leave it to anyone. 
 They died in a fire when I was 7, and then it was given... 
 Please don't... don't get upset. 
 Why do you always have to do that? 
 What? 
 Make me upset and then tell me not to get upset. 
 You can't just knock on my door and ask for $135,000... 
 Do you not have it?

 That money was for my husband and my children.

 That's not what this is about. 
 No! 
 It's about the accident! It's about the judge!

 Not for what came before, but for what came after. 
 It was a test for what comes now. 
 Well, if it was a test, then I think you may be failing it.
