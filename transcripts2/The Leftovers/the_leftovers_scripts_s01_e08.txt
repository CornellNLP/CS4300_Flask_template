 Is he in there? 
 What? 
 My father, is he in there with you? 
 They let him out? 
 He escaped. 
 Don't tell your dad you saw me. 
 Come on, Chief! I got one trapped! 
 Why is there a dog tied up in our yard? 
 Your dad brought it home last night. I can't believe you didn't wake up. 
 You don't remember, do you? 
 What? 
 Last night. 
 Of course I remember. 
 This whistle blew three years ago. 
 Your services are being requested. 
 I'm not gonna leave my family. 
 Don't wake up. 
 Go to sleep! 
 I've seen a gun in her purse. 
 You believe that you will always feel that pain. 
 And if it starts to slip away you'll seek it out again. 
 Let me take it from you. 
 Maybe we should do dinner sometime? 
 I would love that. 
 They're not gonna let you off that easy, son. 
 I think I might be going crazy. 
 Well, my friend. You've come to the right place.

 Sorry about the dog. 
 Kevin : Believe it or not, it used to be a lot worse. 
 What's his name? 
 Nothing's really stuck yet. 
 You have a dog? 
 I used to. 
 His name was Bubba. 
 Bubba? 
 Bubba. 
 Oh. [Both chuckle] 
 So, Ms. Durst... 
 Nora. 
 Nora, you do that whole questionnaire thingy for the government, right? 
 Uh-huh. 
 So you, like, ask stuff to find out what they had in common, everybody who... poofed? 
 Heh! That's the idea. 
 So do people, like, freak out? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, I just mean, if I lost somebody and then I had to answer a bunch of personal questions about them to get a benefit check, I'd probably go mental. 
 No offense. 
 I've never seen anybody go mental. 
 They're sad, but they're safe. 
 Then why do you carry a gun? 
 What? 
 She has a gun in her purse. 
 Right? 
 What makes you think she has... 
 Actually, Jill, I used to have a gun, but I don't need it anymore. 
 Why'd you need it before? 
 Kevin : Jill. 
 It made me feel better. 
 Then why'd you get rid of it? 
 Jill. 
 What? 
 Enough. 
 Kevin : Sorry. 
 Nora : It's ok. 
 I just want to know how she got better. 
 Hey. 
 Nora's a guest in our house. 
 I'm just asking our guest a question. 
 Then cut the sh1t, Jill. 
 Go ahead. Take a look. 
 Nora, you don't have... 
 It's ok, really. 
 Go ahead. 
 Apologize. 
 She doesn't have to. 
 Yes, she does have to. 
 Sorry. 
 No worries. 
 I think she really likes me. 
 [Scoffs] 
 She said she was looking forward to it. 
 Well... 
 I swear. 
 Now that I've been inspected for firearms, the worst is over. 
 Don't go back in and fight with her. 
 That's what she wants. 
 I mean, sorry. She started it, and... 
 That's very mature of you.

 Is my dad downstairs? 
 Nope. 
 I guess you must have scared him off to her place. 
 Bang, bang.

 Let's see what Patti says. 
 [Fly buzzing] 
 Uh, I think she's playing possum. 
 You playin' possum, gorgeous? 
 Well, maybe you hit her a little too hard, huh? 
 Oh. 
 [Panting] 
 Hey, what the hell's wrong with you? 
 What happened last night? 
 What? 
 I need you to tell me everything that... that happened last night. 
 Why? 
 I... I don't think I remember. 
 You don't think you remember? 
 ♪ 
 This... was all your idea, asshole. 
 What do you remember? 
 I... I remember... 
 Getting into bed. 
 Oh, come on. What, are you saying... 
 What, that you're f*ckin' sleepwalking? 
 Just tell me. 
 Well... Kevin... 
 Apparently you got out of bed and showed up at the bar. 
 And we had a couple, and you insisted on giving me a lift home, at which point we passed our lady friend in there. 
 When she looked up, she gave you that "go f*ck yourself" smile. 
 Next thing I know, you were out of the truck, grabbing her. 
 Nothing like a spontaneous abduction to get the heart f*ckin' pumpin' and... boom! We are off to Cairo, New York. 
 We're... we're in Cairo? 
 Well, you gave me directions! 
 You said that you... you used to come to camp, somethin' up here when you were little. 
 You snuck off to the cabin to smoke cigarettes. 
 Why? Why would you do this with me? 
 Because we're friends. 
 Before last night, when was the last time we saw each other? 
 I don't know. Couple weeks back, you know. 
 Uh, when we made the bet. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 [Sighs] 
 We caught a dog, and you bet that you could civilize him. 
 You win, I stop shootin' the fuckers, I win, you give me a dollar? 
 Yeah, and I will collect that dollar, so don't try using this amnesia bullshit to back out. 
 No, I don't have f*ckin' amnesia. 
 Well, then what the f*ck have you got?! 
 [Thud inside] 
 sh1t. 
 Oh, f*ck. Jesus. 
 You ok? 
 I think things... 
 Got a little out of control last night. 
 Jesus, Chief. What the hell... 
 Shut the f*ck up. 
 I shouldn't have done this to you. 
 But you... Kept f*ckin' pushing me, Patti, and I reacted. 
 So I'm gonna let you go and we're gonna get in the truck and I'm gonna drive you home. 
 And all the bullshit up until now, we're gonna call it even. 
 We're gonna forget that it ev... 
 I don't forget. 
 Well, well. 
 It speaks. 
 Gosh, you're so friendly now. 
 Patti : Tell me, am I still a fat, heartless c**t? 
 That's what he said, right? 
 That is my recollection, yes. 
 Well, Kevin, that is a kind offer. 
 Take me home, give a polite little beep as you drive off, but you should know that I have every intention of reporting you to the actual authorities. 
 I will tell them that I was abducted off the street, and I will identify my attackers. 
 And they will take your job, and then they will take your child. 
 You want to undo this, but I simply cannot allow that, so... 
 You're just going to have to batten down the hatches and finish what you started here, my friend. 
 Now get me a f*ckin' cigarette! 
 Man on TV : However, when allied tanks arrived on the outskirts of Daafeed, the mass grave was empty. 
 Locals described a miraculous resurrection... 
 How long do I have to wait here? 
 Why are you so mad? 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 I mean, if we don't stand up to him, then he's just gonna keep on coming at us. 
 Why not? They f*cking hit us, they spit in our faces, they spray us with hoses. 
 Of course.

 Matt : Please. 
 This is my sister Nora, my wife Mary. 
 This is Laurie and Megan. 
 Nora : She's the one who attacked you? 
 Matt : It's ok. 
 Megan's mother passed away on October 13th, one day before the departure. 
 She has a right to be angry. 
 Her grief was hijacked. 
 I accept your apology. 
 Nora : She's not sorry. 
 She's here. It's a start. 
 ♪ 
 I'm not giving up on you. 
 Thank you for coming by. 
 Nora : Hey, Laurie. 
 If you're giving out apologies, I have a suggestion for your next stop. 
 I had dinner with your daughter last night. 
 You might want to drop by and write her a note, too.

 Aimee : So Garvey's totally just staring her down, and she's all like, "you're there sitting in my mom's chair, eating my dad's delicious chicken? Uh-uh." 
 It wasn't my mom's chair. 
 Ok, and Nora, who I know on a first-name basis, oh, by the way, she's all like, "go ahead. 
 I don't give a sh1t. Look in my purse." 
 And I'm like, "damn, is she bluffing?" 
 Because obviously Garvey's supposed to just be like, "oh, sorry, no, forget it." But no, f*ck that. 
 Garvey grabs her purse, looks in that sh1t, and... 
 No gun! 
 Ha! 
 I don't get it. 
 Why does it matter? 
 Because she's lying. 
 It wasn't in her purse, but she still has it. 
 How do you know? 
 'Cause I know. 
 But what's that got to do with the gun? 
 Absolutely nothing. 
 Garvey is just cock-blocking her dad. 
 She was pretending. 
 Pretending what? 
 To be ok. 
 She lost her entire family. 
 Just so you know, it is possible for some people to be ok, Jill. 
 Are you ok, Aimee? 
 Ok... 
 I am f*ckin' fantastic, and I got to say, I think your dad would be, too, if you'd just f*ckin' let him. 
 Guys, let's just calm down. Come on. 
 Did you f*ck him? 
 Whoa. Hey. 
 What? 
 Let's play ping-pong, ok? 
 Scott : Yeah. Right? 
 Did you? 
 Did you f*ck my dad? 
 ♪ 
 Yeah, Jill. 
 I did. 
 I f*cked your dad. 
 And I felt really bad about it, so I was like, "hey, Mr. Garvey, this is so wrong." 
 But he was like, "hey, "let's stop pretending to be ok because no one is ok." 
 And he was totally right, and he was so hard, Jill... 
 So I f*cked the sh1t out of him on top of a pile of guns. 
 f*ck you. 
 f*ck you!

 Patti : Other pocket. 
 If I cut you loose, you gonna behave? 
 Jesus. Chief, she just spit in your face. 
 You want her to bite your goddamn nose off, too? 
 Certainly a risk. 
 You want one? Help yourself. 
 I don't smoke. 
 Oh? 
 I seem to recall Laurie telling me that you did. 
 I quit. 
 Who do you report to? 
 Sorry? 
 Your organization. 
 Your f*cking cult. Where do you get your orders? 
 We don't take orders. 
 Bullshit. 
 People have f*cking chapters all over the country. 
 Ok, I'm sorry, but you brought me here and strapped me up so you could ask me about my organization? 
 Just answer the f*cking question. 
 And who might you be, sir? 
 This ain't workin' out, Chief. 
 Patti : Reason I ask is because I've had some experience in research, and most people, you can find out all sorts of things about 'em with no trouble at all. 
 But you, dog killer... no driver's license, no records, no anything, so I don't know. 
 You may be able to shed some light about your friend here, but as far as I can tell, he's a ghost. 
 I prefer to think of myself as a guardian angel. 
 Well, sh1t. 
 I think I just heard a bell ring.

 When we did this last night... 
 What did I say I wanted? 
 You said it was time to end it. 
 [Voice trembling] I don't want to hurt her. 
 Oh, yes, you do. 
 After what she took from your town? 
 From your family? 
 There have to be consequences. 
 Look... 
 Chief, I get it. 
 You tried every way you could to stop these f*cks, but you could only get so far because you are a good man. 
 So how about you go back to the truck and get comfortable, close your eyes?

 All right, stop. Click it, Garvey. 
 I got it. 
 Right.

 Scott : What the hell, man? 
 We're looking for a gun. Nobody keeps the gun in the crisper, dude. 
 That's where I would hide it. 
 What if she comes home? 
 Adam : Then she'll go right for the gun. 
 Boom. Mystery solved. 
 Scott : That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life. 
 Adam : Oh, my God. Shut up, Scott.
