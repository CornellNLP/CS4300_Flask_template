♪ We'll need someone to lean on... ♪ [rumbling] [coughing] Holy sh1t. How long? Were you dead? Eight hours. Is she still with you? Patti? No. She's gone. Then it worked. Did you bury me? My grandfather told me to. He's gone, too. I'm sorry. Where you went... did he help you? Yeah. He helped me a lot. What was it like? It was like a-- a hotel. A hotel? Yeah. Did you see my sister there? No. I saw her somewhere else. I've got to talk to your father. Erika :  How long you been up? A while. No coffee in the coffeepot. What are you drinking? [sniffs] You going to church? [scoffs] Now why would I do that? It's October 14th. We go to remember. I don't want to remember. John, open it. Open it or I will. It's my birthday present and I'll open it when I'm ready. Wait! [paper ripping] What-- what is it? [chuckles] She found it. No, she didn't. What? The night she disappeared, I was here when you and Michael went to find her. Chirped the whole time. She must have caught another one and put it in the box. And why would she do that? Because you wouldn't let it go. f*ck you, Erika. [knocking on door] John. What happened? The print on the car that Evie disappeared from... Yeah? You know how we told you you'd waste your time trying to match it with folks in town? You weren't. [pounding] Hi. Uh, hey. Who are you? I'm Laurie. Garvey. Who are you? I'm John. I live next door. Is Kevin home? Uh, no, he's-- What's going on? Oh, hey, Jill. I'm looking for your dad. Why? What's happening? I just need to talk to him. You know where he is? No, but I'm sure he'll be back. John :  Are you? What? Sure he'll come back. Oh, he's definitely coming back. Print matched? Indeed it did. You want to talk, we should go inside. No, we probably should talk somewhere neutral. Okay. Yeah, we'll give you a ride. Everything's okay. Stay here. Everything's fine. What are you doing with him? Just listen to what he has to say. I'll be all right. Stay here. [engine starts] Where have you been? Your dad's. I thought I told you not to go over there anymore. I won't. You going to church? Go inside and get changed. Jill. You're gonna have to talk to me eventually. What did you just say? I said you're gonna have to talk to me. I have to talk to you? I know. I know I deserve that and I know that you're angry. No! You don't know sh1t. I know that your father's not doing very well right now. He's got-- he's got some serious problems, Jill, and I'm sure you know that, too. I came back here looking for your brother, okay? And your father asked me to stay. He asked for my help. I'm not asking for anything. Jill, this is your house and if you want me to, I will leave. I will leave right now. He said that we should stay. [sighs] [Lily crying] [thumps] Oh, sorry. Okay. All right. Okay, sit tight. I'm gonna find that feeding tube and we'll get out of here, okay? Bingo! Right where Matt said it was. I'm just gonna change her real quick, okay? Okay. Okay. How about some music? You want some music? Let's try this. Okay. [music playing] [crying louder] I know. I don't like that, either. ♪ For the sunshiny sky... ♪ Oh, that's better. Caller :  She's staying at her sister's. That's better. She's not coming back. October, it's always, you know, hard for her. I can't believe it's been four years. Radio host :  Did you lose someone? Caller :  Our little girl, Emily. Radio host :  How old was she? Caller :  14 months. She was talking real sentences. Before any of our friends' kids. I bragged about it. Radio host :  Well, that's what proud fathers do. Can I ask what happened? Why your wife left? Caller :  I want to have another baby. Radio host :  And your wife? Caller :  She says it would hurt too much. Now, I told her we could start over. It's a new life. It'll help us, you know, forget. Radio host :  You know what, Andy? I'm gonna have to side with your wife on this one. She's not ready. That thing inside all of us, that mechanism that allows us to love, your wife's, it's broken. And a new baby's not going to fix that. But you know what can? Jesus. After all, he was the original Departure, right? Fix that, Jesus. Yeah, it's okay. [rumbling] [crying] [rumbling stops] [crying] Shh, shh, shh. Nora. What are you doing here? Where's Matt? [laughs] Oh, my God. Hi. Hi. Matt. Is this real? This is real? It's real. Oh, God! Oh, thank God. [laughing] Oh! Are you all right? I'm a little confused, but okay. You have to take her back right now. What? Mary, listen. You can't be out here. It's not-- you have to go back to town right now. Okay, let's go, then. No, I can't. You have to take her back right now. It's not safe out here. The baby. The what? You didn't tell her? Nora :  I thought you would want to. I'm pregnant? [both laugh] Now, Mary, do you remember the night you woke up, we, um-- Had s*x? Yes. Of course I remember. Well, you waking up, that happened. This baby happened because you were across that bridge in that town. Now, I'll get there soon enough, but you've got to go now. Tell you what-- I'm gonna feed Lily and I'll come back in 10 minutes. Hey, Nora-- 10 minutes, Matt. And then I'll take her back in, I promise. Okay, thank you. You're very welcome. Hey, where'd you steal her from? That's not your baby. That's not your baby. That's not her baby. Meg :  You know her? She's your dad's girlfriend, right? She sprayed me with a hose once. I liked her. Are you scared for them? For your family? There is no family. Where'd you hear that? I thought that's the point. No, Tom. That's not the point at all. Family is everything. Here we go. Sorry, ma'am. Park's closed today. Really? Why? It's October 14th. It's the anniversary of the Departure. It's a time for the townfolks to be with themselves, reflect. Reflect on what? I'm sorry? Well, nothing happened here to the townsfolk. It's kind of like a temple closing down on Christmas. Not really your holiday, don't you think? I'm sorry, ma'am, but unless you have a wristband or a dispensation form, I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around. I have 35 pounds of plastic explosive. Will that work? What? Ranger : Whoa! Stop! Someone-- Hey! Ranger :  We have a runner on the bridge. We have a runner on the bridge. Ranger #2 :  Go, let's go! Let's go! [crowd murmuring] [keys jingle] Stop! Get down on the ground now! I said get down! Get on the ground now! Get in there, cuff her. We got an unauthorized vehicle on the bridge. Possible code blue. I repeat, possible code blue. [door opens] [dogs barking] Which one is yours? What? Well, they took your dog when you got here, right? Which one is he? I know we're not here to talk about my dog, John. No, that's exactly why we're here, Kevin. You tell me where my daughter is and I'll let you take your dog home. I don't know where your daughter is, but I know she didn't depart. No? Well, what did she do? She staged it. She and her friends, to make it look like-- And you know this how? I saw her do it. You saw her do it and you waited all this time to tell me? I didn't remember until this morning. What sparked it, this memory? What do you want me to tell you, John? I want you to tell me the truth. What made you remember? I died. I had a-- a problem. Michael took me to his grandfather's. He said he could help. He gave me, like, a-- My son took you to meet his grandfather? Yeah, Virgil. He helped me. No, Michael wouldn't do that. Listen, man, he did. I swear, man, he did. Prove it. The old man told me what he did to you. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. No one should ever-- Man, shut the f*ck up. That's a lie. He didn't do nothing to me. You don't know sh1t. All right, now-- look, let's stay focused, man, because, see, I want to make sure I get this. Yeah. You saw my daughter pretend to disappear and the only reason you remember that today is because you came back from the dead? I know you don't think it can happen here, John, but it did. You're right, Kevin. That can't happen here. But I need you to explain me this. Evie loved her mother. She loved her brother. And she loved me. So why in God's name would she do this to us? I don't know. Okay, well, take a f*cking guess. Maybe she didn't. What? Love you. Who knows what goes through people's heads? You know, your daughter-- [gunshot] [dogs barking] [vehicle approaches] Ranger :  Hey! What's going on? John, it's Evie. Follow us. [vehicle departs] What? [siren wailing] [music playing] 
 
 [no audible dialogue] Evie! John, you gotta get back. No, you have got to let me through. We can't. There's a bomb in the trailer. What? Buddy, you gotta go back. John, you gotta get back. The trailer is rigged with explosives. Why-- why would anybody do-- Evie! What happened? Can I borrow those? It's the three girls. What three girls? The ones who departed. [Lily crying] No, no, no, no. We won't be able to get back in. They're gonna blow up the bridge! There's a bomb! [buzzer sounds] [cheering] [crowd chanting] Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up! [chanting continues] Choir :  ♪ Our hearts were pure, we knew for sure ♪ 
♪ A miracle ♪ 
♪ That God had spared our town ♪ [applause, cheering] [taps echo] October 14th. Four years ago. Everywhere else in the world, they knew something had happened. Yeah. Massey :  But we didn't. No. Not until the phones started ringing. Till we turned on our televisions. And we ran out onto the streets. Found each other. Woman :  Yes, we did. Massey :  And everyone asked the same question-- is everyone okay? Is everyone still here? Congregation : Yes. Massey :  And we were. Congregation : Amen. Massey :  We were still here. Congregation : Amen. Massey :  We were-- [people whispering] [whispering] Michael has asked to say a few words. My mom tells a story. A lot of you have probably heard it. She says that there was water trickling down the stairs in our house. And when she followed it up, she saw that it was coming from the bathroom. [light laughter] She opened the door and she swears a wave just washed past her. [laughter] And there were me and Evie, five years old and an overflowing tub. My mom says she asked Evie why she did it. And my sister said, "I just wanted to see what would happen." [laughter] That's the story that you always tell and everyone laughs, even me and Evie. She laughed to protect you, Mom, because it's not the truth. I'm the one who turned the water on. I turned it on all the way because Evie was crying so loud and she didn't want you to hear. She was crying because we didn't know why our father was gone. Or why he did what he did. But she was crying so loud. So I turned the water on and I drowned her out. Until she could pretend she was okay. Nobody disappeared from here on October 14th four years ago. But they did before. And after. We are the 9,261. We are not spared. [doors open] [music playing] [no audible dialogue] [people murmuring] Woman :  That's not your baby. That's not your baby. She doesn't belong to you. Shut the f*ck up! [fusses] It's okay. It's okay. That clock, what is that? What's inside here? Y'all just gonna blow yourselves up? Man :  Whoo! [chattering] Ranger :  Y'all need to move back now. Ranger #2 :  Everybody move back. Back up. Ma'am, back up, please. Dad. Ranger :  Sir, I want you to step back. Ranger #2 :  Back up. Ranger :  Step back. Back up. Erika! Everybody, back up. Get off the bridge! Erika! Are you just gonna blow yourself up? 'Cause if that's what it is, I'm not leaving this bridge, Evangeline. I'm not. You're just gonna have to blow me up, too. Get out of my way! It's empty! [faintly] It's empty! It's empty! It's empty! [buzzer sounds] Man :  Oh, Lord! Nothing. It's zero. [people shouting] Okay, rangers, hold that gate. Get away from the fence. Everybody, back off. Hold the fence. Hold the-- Back off! Back off! Everyone, back off! Pull back! Right there. Pull back! There's too many of them. Let them go. Let them go! Why are you doing this? I don't understand. [marker scratching] We need to go now. Okay, my car's over there. We can pack-- No, we're going in. Matt. Mary, I need you to trust me. We need to get you and the baby back in. Now is our chance. Do you trust me? Yes. Okay, let's go. Matt, wait. [Lily crying] Wait! She's not yours. Hey! Hey! Hey! Man :  Hurry up, hurry up. Man #2 :  Hurry up. [Lily crying] Nora. [crying] It's okay. You're safe. Okay. Hey. It's okay. You're okay. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. [water dripping] [gasping, coughing] [gasping] m*therf*cker. m*therf*cker! [static hissing] Dad? Dad? Can you hear me? I'm not f*cking doing this again. Where are you? f*ck! [phone ringing] Hello? Man :  Mr. Garvey? Yeah? We're aware this isn't your jurisdiction. You're a police officer, right? Uh, that's right. Something terrible is happening in the lobby bar. Another officer, he's being attacked. I think they're gonna kill him. I'll be right there. Man :  Yeah.
