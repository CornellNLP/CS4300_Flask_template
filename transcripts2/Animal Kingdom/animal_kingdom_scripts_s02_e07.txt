 We had a hero with a concealed .  .     
 Hero fires, hits Lou in the gut.     
 Lou has a shotgun, takes hero's head off.     
 But Lou's already bleeding out from the gut wound and, uh, he's not gonna make it, hospital or no.     
 So Manny just put him out of his misery.     
 And then we drove the body to a construction site that... I don't know, someone just knew they were pouring the foundation for a house the next day.     
 We buried him under it.     
 You told us Lou ran off with the money.     
 Javi is threatening to go to the police and let them know where the body is.

 Too late to do anything.
