 Smurf didn't set the fire. She made Pope do it. 
 Is this when ask me to turn against the father of my kid? 
 Yes. 
 Everything you told me, the ins and outs of the base, you're not just in, you made it happen. 
 If there is money in that car when I get it back, I will throw it in the base incinerator. 
 I did coke with Craig. 
 And then I... him. 
 Anything good, they destroy. 
 They use everyone. 
 J, I think it's time we call that detective. 
 Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Just don't screw up this time.

 They hurt people, Josh. 
 A lot of people. 
 You know that, don't you? 
 Alexa tells me you have reason to believe your grandmother and your uncles might be planning another crime. 
 Is that true? 
 They're my family. 
 No. 
 They're not. 
 They don't care about you. 
 Do they ever do anything to help you or your mother when she was struggling? 
 Make sure you were safe? 
 Had enough to eat?

 If Smurf had to choose, do you honestly think she would hesitate to throw you to the wolves if it meant protecting one of your uncles?

 Yeah, well... 
 No news is good news. 
 Yeah. 
 Smurf, I know that we don't always see things the same way. 
 But I think... for whatever reason that's happened in the past, it would be a good thing if we could put that behind us, start over. 
 Is that supposed to be an apology, sweetheart? 
 Sure. 
 Baz put you up to it? 
 No.

 She got mad when I played with the siren, too.

 Mommy's friend's car has a siren. 
 Oh. 
 I was supposed to make the big light go, but I accidentally hit the siren.

 Nicky slept with my uncle.

 No, Craig. 
 Okay, and now you're concerned for her and her father because Craig's going to harm them? 
 No. 
 Tell me about Baz and Pope and Smurf. 
 Did they tell you what they're planning next? 
 No, they don't really talk when I'm around. 
 You came here to me, to Alexa, because you're afraid. 
 I can keep you safe. 
 I can keep them from hurting you. 
 Alexa says you're a smart kid, Josh. 
 Are you smart enough to know who your real friends are? 
 Are you smart enough to know that we are your best, maybe your only way out of this?

 You're gonna put on the wire, you're gonna go back to your grandmother's house, you're gonna find out what they're planning, when they're planning to do it. 
 You're gonna come back to us, and we're gonna take them down. 
 You know, it would be a real tragedy if Smurf found out you were here all night, talking to us. 
 How long before she sends one of your uncles to find you? 
 Pope? Or Baz? Craig? 
 Craig would probably bring Deran along. 
 He always does. 
 Deran would be happy to help, from what you told us. 
 Maybe they'd be gentle about it, a single bullet to the back of the head. 
 Then again, maybe they won't.
