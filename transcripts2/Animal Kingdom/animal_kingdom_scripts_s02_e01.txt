  Baz: Hey. 
  Hey. 
  We're about to pull a good job here, life-changing money. 
  Camp Pendleton... 
  we're gonna hit it. 
  There is a ton of cash on that base. 
  I did coke with Craig, and then I f*cked him. 
  You and me gonna have a problem? 
  Oh, no, we're cool. 
  I'm here for Craig. 
  Scottie: Who are you? 
  His mother. 
  You called your mom?

  If Cath was stepping out on me, she wouldn't leave Lena alone in the house. 
  She wouldn't do it, not ever! 
  She's gone for good. 
  I know something happened. 
  She wouldn't leave. 
  I have something for you. 
  A man should have a gun. 
  See, my mom... 
  she hated them. 
  In the end, she's a Cody. 
  And I'm a Cody, too.

  We pitched her a million other jobs.

  Yes. 
  And who decides when that is? 
  We'll figure it out! 
  What are you complaining about? 
  What if one of us hits a job on our own, or two or three of us hit a job?
