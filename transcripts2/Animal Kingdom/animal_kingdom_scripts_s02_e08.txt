  Doesn't mean they can't be found, just depends on how bad you want it. 
  They asked if I had an alibi, as if I had something to do with stealing the mission drive money. 
  It's gonna be fine. 
  Pope: And the checks? 
  Baz: I say we don't risk it. 
  Pope: I'll take care of it. 
  I got pulled over this afternoon. 
  He starts asking me about Cath, what I did to her. 
  They think he killed Cath. 
  Smurf: Cops don't know anything. 
  What if they arrest Baz?
