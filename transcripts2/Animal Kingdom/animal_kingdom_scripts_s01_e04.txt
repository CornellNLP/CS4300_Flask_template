 J : I just wanted to say that I didn't see anything the other day... in the bathroom. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Smurf : Deran feels terrible about what he did. 
 Catherine : A security guard died, and he wasn't just a security guard... he was a real cop. 
 Do you know who my dad is? 
 There was only one that she really loved. 
 Was it Baz? 
 Catherine : You kidnapped my child. 
 Smurf : Your child was wandering around a grocery store all by herself. 
 You're lucky she wasn't  really  kidnapped. 
 What kind of family do you think we are, man? 
 Destroy the watches. 
 Craig : What?! 
 Pope : Where is it... the watch I gave you? 
 J : I gave it to Nicky. 
 Some of us gotta work to live. 
 Parole agent's coming around, I'm not looking to take  any  risk. 
 Smurf : Lie low. Don't be stupid. We'll be okay. 
 Baz : He said pulling off another job is not gonna play so well. 
 Feel like making some money... old time's sake? 
 What kind of money you talking? 
 I can't just toss a quarter key out the window. 
 Where is it? 
 [Clears throat] 
 It's fine. It's in the burrito. 
 We made 8 grand! 
 Smurf : We don't take stupid risks. We're not greedy. 
 Sometimes one of these rules gets broken. 
 There are no secrets in this family... especially not from me.

 [Alarm clock beeping] 
 [Beeping stops] 
 [Knock on door] 
 I'm sorry for the pool. 
 I was just screwing around, so... 
 Oh, that's cool. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You want to take a swing at me? 
 [Scoffs] 
 No. 
 Not gonna make the offer again. 
 Do you know what that is? 
 Is that Baz, Pope, Julia? 
 Oh, I'm surprised Smurf didn't sand that sh1t off, man. 
 Smurf asks, we're cool, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 When'd you get here? 
 How the hell does this thing work? 
 They didn't have espresso machines at Folsom? 
 I just want coffee. 
 Okay. 
 Where's breakfast? 
 Smurf didn't make it. 
 Yeah, no sh1t. 
 Is Craig here? 
 Uh, no, he spent the night at his place. 
 But he's still in for paintball. 
 What? 
 Paintball on your birthday... like always. 
 No, I... no, thanks. 
 Come on... you get to shoot something without getting arrested. 
 I thought you love paintball. 
 Yeah, when I was 16. 
 I don't know, man. 
 We're also going skydiving this afternoon, too. 
 No. We're not. 
 You've been staring at bars for three years. 
 Let's go have some fun. Come on. 
 Besides, I already put the down payment on the plane, so you gotta go. 
 What plane? 
 For Pope's birthday. 
 Skydiving, paintball. We're gonna take him out tonight. 
 Celebrate the fact that we don't have to go through a metal detector to bring him his cake this year. 
 Happy birthday, sweetie. 
 [Refrigerator door opens, bottles clank] 
 Sounds like a fun day. 
 Yeah, for  them. 
 What does that mean? 
 It's all sh1t that  you  want to do. 
 You love paintball, you like strip clubs, Craig likes jumping out of planes. 
 All right, asshole, what do  you  want to do? 
 I'm gonna go catch a session before the tide gets too high. 
 Okay. [Smooches] 
 Bye, baby. 
 [Door opens] 
 That's quite a lavish day you have planned. 
 You need any money? 
 No, we got it covered. 
 Yeah, we pooled what we had, called in some favors, so we're good. 
 Okay. 
 I talked to J. It's all good. 
 Smurf. 
 Hey, I think we need to get back to work, talk about the next job, no? 
 How's Lena? 
 Uh, well, Cath has been sick, so that's why she hasn't brought her over. 
 Morning, sweetie. 
 Morning. 
 She's been sick? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I would have gone over and helped her take care of the baby if she called. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Come on, Smurf. You took her kid. 
 She has every right to be pissed. 
 Tell her I hope she feels better. 
 You're still so shy. 
 I changed your diapers every day, baby. 
 Go on. I won't look. 
 Hey, sweetie, do you need anything? 
 Maybe some money? 
 No. 
 Hmm? 
 Don't tell your uncles. 
 They've been on me for cash for weeks. 
 And now they have this big birthday plan for Pope. 
 How do you think they'll manage that? 
 They haven't asked me for any money. 
 I'm not sure. 
 You haven't heard anything around the house, boys talking or anything? 
 Nope. 
 I'll show you a thing or two about paintball. 
 Pope : Yeah, like you know. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I'm going out to pick some things up for tonight. 
 If I find one speck of paint on this house, God help you.

 [Laughing] Sorry.

 [Cellphone chimes] 
 Oh, you wanna... Oh, ho ho! 
 Cutback. 
 Give me your phones. Smurf's been arrested. 
 Uh, get the passport, get Craig here, and then start shredding. 
 Yeah, yeah. How much? 
 Everything! J, give me your phone, too. 
 I gotta change out the SIM card. 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 [Inhales] 
 sh1t, Renn. I-I gotta go. 
 sh1t! 
 I gotta go. 
 Pope : Just like that? 
 Yeah. Put everything in the truck. 
 Leaving town tells them we're guilty. 
 Yeah, we  are. 
 [Motorcycle engine revs] 
 In, in, in. 
 Hey, Craig, give Deran a hand inside and get the cash behind the dryer, okay? 
 I'm gonna call you when we get to the safe house. 
 Pope : What? 
 You said we shouldn't run, so don't run. 
 Hey, get in. 
 Y-You're taking  him? 
 I know that you're not gonna roll on us if the cops squeeze you. 
 Him, I'm not so sure of. 
 Baz, I don't have a passport. 
 Okay, well, we'll figure it out. 
 Get in the car! 
 Like hell you're leaving me behind. 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Engines turn off] 
 Baz : Let's go. 
 J, put the food there. 
 What happened? What went wrong? 
 Just relax. 
 We're just gonna sit tight, wait for the lawyer to call, then we're home-free. 
 So, what... Venezuela? 
 Yeah, buddy, Venezuela. 
 I'm not the one that screwed up the watch store recon. 
 So you're just gonna have to... 
 I told you we should have taken out those tweakers. 
 If the tweakers could have I.D.'d anyone, the cops would have picked  us  up, not Smurf. 
 Are you gonna call her? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna ring up Oceanside PD and ask if Smurf's available. 
 Catherine. 
 After we cross the border, I will call Catherine. 
 Okay? 
 [Vehicle approaches] 
 Hey. 
 Down. Get down. Get down. 
 [Banging on door] 
 [Banging on door] 
 Smurf : Open up. 
 And try not to shoot me. 
 You bring the passports? 
 Craig : Cops let you out? 
 She was never in. 
 So, this was what... some kind of test? 
 I'll take the keys to Chula Vista, please. 
 Cash. 
 This feels light. 
 Someone must have dipped into it. 
 How do you expect to get to South America on this? 
 I didn't touch the money. 
 It's your responsibility. 
 You put us through all this for nothing?! 
 Hey, what happened to not taking risks? 
 You are running bullshit jobs behind my back! 
 Now, that's what I call a risk! 
 We are not running  any  jobs. 
 I'm gonna give you an opportunity to come clean. 
 Someone better tell the truth. 
 There'll be no next job. 
 Craig : We're gonna stop working? 
 Not me...  you. 
 No more money. You're on your own. 
 Deran : What?! 
 This conversation is over. 
 That's bullshit! What are we supposed to do?! 
 This conversation is over! 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door creaks, closes] 
 Do you think what I said was only meant for  them? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I didn't do anything behind your back. 
 Put this sh1t back where it belongs. 
 Where were you? 
 I had to copy my history homework from Kristy Peters, and she can barely spell her name. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I just had a weird morning. 
 [Chuckles] 
 This'll help. 
 [School bell rings] 
 Okay? 
 What do 4-year-olds like to eat? 
 What? 
 Well, you have a younger brother. 
 I don't know... Play-Doh? [Chuckles] 
 I can't believe you haven't noticed. 
 Where did you find it? 
 It must have fallen in my bag. 
 You didn't tell me it was your mom's. 
 Yeah, well, that's no big deal. 
 Yes, it is. 
 I'll never take it off again. 
 Just don't wear it to the house. 
 Smurf and my mom, they, uh... 
 They had a falling-out. It might drudge up some old sh1t. 
 Okay. 
 Gimme it. 
 J. You missed my class. 
 Whose is this? 
 Well, it didn't smoke  itself. 
 It's mine. 
 Nicky, you can go. 
 Now,  Nicky. 
 [Engines turn off] 
 What do you think Smurf knows? 
 I don't know, man. I wouldn't let it get to your head, though. 
 She says she knows. 
 Yeah, well, what's there to know? 
 Nothing. 
 This one's yours, man. 
 I didn't put a hole in it. 
 It was a one-time thing. 
 So, what is going on with you? 
 Does your grandmother know you smoke pot? 
 What, are you gonna kick me out of school? 
 No. 
 You're too smart to be a dropout. 
 Lighter? 
 Come on. Give me your lighter. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You surf, right, J? 
 Sometimes. 
 A photographer I like is doing an exhibit in Carlsbad. 
 Surf photos. 
 Want to go? 
 What? 
 You bring something up from Mexico? 
 No. 
 Coke or meth? 
 Do I look like I sell meth? 
 Coke it is. 
 How much did you clear? 
 8! 
 That's it? 
 We cleared 12.5. 
 You guys did a job? 
 Us and the kid. 
 You lied to my face! 
 Yeah, what about all the bullshit you were telling  me  before? 
 Wait a sec! You're telling me J got a piece?! 
 He didn't cut and run. 
 I didn't run, okay? 
 I could have sworn that was  your  ass going in the other direction. 
 Why didn't you cut me in?! 
 'Cause you were in Mexico, you idiot. 
 Well, wait a goddamn day! 
 Hey! 
 Where's my cut of the coke?! 
 Not here! 
 [Both grunting] 
 Aaah! 
 Pope : Way to go, genius! You let him get away! 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Whoo! Whoo! Aah!

 Oh, what about you? Drugs across the border? 
 Yeah, no risk there. 
 You should have come to me first! 
 I gotta run everything by you now? 
 Is that how it works? 
 Yeah! 
 Since you went away, yes. 
 Are you really mad that I did a job or is it that I cleared more than you?

 I wanted to thank him for something. 
 Wouldn't you be more comfortable waiting by the pool? 
 Yeah. 
 [Car door unlocks] 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, is Baz here? 
 No. He's not back yet. 
 I, uh... I got some food for Lena, 'cause I heard you weren't feeling well. 
 Baz said. 
 Why didn't you go with the guys to celebrate Pope's birthday? 
 What's in the bag? 
 Stuff for mac and cheese. 
 Come in.

 My mom really liked it. [Chuckles] 
 Today must be hard. 
 It's your mom's birthday, too, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it's weird. 
 No one even talks about her. It's... 
 It's like she never existed. 
 Yeah. 
 That's Smurf. 
 Did you know my mom? 
 A little. 
 What about her and Baz? Were  they  close? 
 He tried to get her help. 
 And it looked like she might turn the corner a couple times. 
 Then the money started disappearing. 
 Couple hundred here or there, and then a lot more. 
 And they just... they had to change locks. 
 Yeah, she said that Smurf kicked her out because she stood up to her. 
 Said Smurf turns on anyone she can't control. 
 Or goes against her. 
 Is it ready yet? 
 Ask J. 
 [Chuckling] Go ahead. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yay! 
 [Chuckles] Yay! 
 Yum! 
 Catherine, where's your bathroom? 
 Around the corner. 
 Thanks. 
 So, what was it, uh, you wanted to thanks J for? 
 [Chuckles] 
 We got busted for smoking pot at school. 
 He said it was his. [Chuckles] 
 Such a good boy. 
 [Door opens] 
 Oh, I have a great pot hookup if you ever want some. 
 Do you really? 
 [Door closes] 
 Yeah. For sure. Anytime. 
 Sure. 
 Yeah. 
 Craig? 
 Are you okay, sweetheart? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Cellphone beeps, ringing] 
 Woman :  Emergency room. 
 Yeah, I'm trying to find someone. 
 A Ray Blackwell. 
 Blackwell? 
 Yeah. 
 Checking. 
 No one by that name has been admitted. Yeah, he's not gonna have I.D. on him. He's a white male in his 60s. Probably reeks like alcohol. Can you check again, please? You are...? His son. One moment. No one by that description has been admitted. Okay, thank you. [Sliding door opens] Hey. I gotta talk to you. Daddy! Hey, sweetie. Ricardo called. The rent's past due. Well, I don't have it. We're laying low. I mean... Oh, okay, I'll tell him that. I'm sure he'll understand. Well, it wouldn't be an issue if we just lived in one of Smurf's buildings. [Laughs] Just ask him if he can let it slide a few more days, please. But you can dig up the money to blow on Pope's birthday. Cath... I already caught it from Smurf. I really don't want to hear it from  you,  too. Oh, just ask  her  for it. Doesn't help that I have to keep making excuses for why you won't bring Lena over. Can I have more? J makes it better than you. What... J? He brought the mac and cheese. [Scoffs] What? He's in the bathroom. What are you doing here, man? Is that my mom? Did Smurf send you? What? To find out if Cath is really sick. Did Smurf send you? No. I thought I told you to come to me. The job with Pope and Deran. You should have talked to me about it first. I'm sorry. You can't just be coming around here, man. This is  my  house. My  family. I'll go. It's his mom's birthday. Not just Pope's. Smurf takes my child without asking, and you want me to apologize? You said sh1t you shouldn't have said! No, I should have hit her with the car! Okay. Do it for  me,  then, please. Just do it for me. Screw... you. Okay. Stand up for me. Cath, fix it. Fix it! What is going on with you? Nothing. Bullshit! Smurf's icing me out. Why didn't you say something? 'Cause I'm trying to handle it. I messed up. The cop? [Sighs] Just feel like sh1t's getting out of control. Smurf will get over it. She needs you. Call her. Baz, I can't. Cath, you gotta call her. You gotta make things right. I would like to make a toast. I'm so happy that we can finally all be together to celebrate the day I first laid eyes on my beautiful, beautiful boy. Here's to my firstborn. Pope. Pope. Make a wish and blow out your candle. It's not just Pope's birthday. It's my mom's, too. Yes, it is. Pope, blow out your candle. Who wants cake? [Dance music plays] [Men cheering, whooping] Excuse me, can we get some girls over here? Sure. To Pope. Pope. Pope. Pope. I think Smurf knows about the jobs. Relax. I told you... She's bluffing. How do you know that? Did anyone say anything? We stick together and our mouths shut, she won't know sh1t. Hey, can we not talk about our mom in the strip club right now? Thank you. Woman : Hey, guys. Dance? Yeah, hey, J, what do you like... brunette or redhead? Doesn't matter. They're both for  me  anyway. [Laughter] Hey, which girl here give a good time? Pepper. Pepper! Pepper?! You want a dance? Yeah. For my man, J. No, he's kidding. No, I'm not. Give him the ride of his life. I have a girlfriend. You're cute. Hear that? Thinks you're cute, bro. Don't hurt her feelings, okay? Thank you. So, is this Pope? Baz : That is Pope. Welcome home, soldier. I was telling her about that classified sh1t you were doing in Afghanistan. She wants to thank you for your service. Yeah, I wasn't in Afghanistan, so... [Chuckles] I don't care, honey. He paid me $1,000 to put a smile on your face, so you coming or what? [Cellphone ringing] [Ringing continues] [Cellphone beeps] Who's this? It's me... Renn. Uh... [Bottle clanks] W-What's up? Where are you? The E.R. Can you come? Uh, yeah, I'll... I'll be right there. [Cellphone beeps] Out. Sit down. You can touch me. Stay right here. Can't remember the last time I had an erection. So... I can fix that. I don't think so. Try me. Stand over there. Turn around. Take off your clothes. Like this? I said turn around. Gotta wear the rubber. [Inhales sharply] [Gasps] Say we can't. What? "We can't." We can't. Say it. We can't. "We can't, Andrew." We can't, Andrew. [Zipper opens] [Wrapper crinkles] Say it like you love me. We can't, Andrew. Mean it. We can't, Andrew. Mean it. We can't, Andrew! ♪♪ [Dance music plays] Where's Deran? He's in the back, with the girls. Let's go. What about Baz? Screw Baz. Let's go. J : S-So, where are we going? You didn't say  anything  to Smurf about that thing we did? No. [Tires screech] Pope, I didn't say anything. Good. Get out. [Gearshift cranks] [Engine shuts off] [Vehicle door closes] You read the Bible? What? The seven seals. Only Jesus can open them. First four unleash the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Conquerors bent on conquest. Do you think that's us? Who? Me, Baz, Craig, and Deran. Four. I don't think so. Yeah, probably not. Over the fence. Pope, I didn't say anything to Smurf. Over the fence. [Sighs] Pope : You remember where Julia is? Well, that tree looks familiar. [Sighs] I thought she was over here, but I think I took you to the wrong side, man. No one even says her name, you know? Yeah. [Sighs] She ever talk about me? Sometimes. We used to have this thing, you know... on our birthday... when we were kids. You know when you, uh, you make a wish, you blow out your candles. After, I'd tell her what my wish was, and then she'd tell me hers. We weren't supposed to do that, but... ...it still felt like a secret. You know? When it... when it was just us. Pope... What about... her and Baz? What about 'em? Were they close, too? Baz has a way of getting what he wants. I didn't... I didn't know that she would never come back. It's not your fault. I get why you felt like you had to kick her out. Yeah? Why is that? Because of the drugs. I mean... Who told you? Catherine. [Exhales deeply] It's cold. [Door closes] Hey. Where's J? Must have left with Pope. [Refrigerator door closes] It's all good with Cath? How should  I  know? She didn't call you? [Chuckles] Nope. Anyone have anything to say to me? [Refrigerator door opens] You have your own places. Why don't you sleep there tonight? Yeah, right. Deran. What? You're not sleeping here tonight. [Scoffs] [Door opens, closes] What are  you  waiting for? Pope pulled a job. Uh-huh. With Deran and the kid. With J? You didn't know? What about Craig? He brought a package back from Mexico. It was a one-time thing. I made sure it won't happen again. You should have made sure it didn't happen in the first place. He hid it from me. Look, I did what you asked. I came clean about the jobs. [Door opens] Hey. You got that joint? I certainly do. [Door opens, closes] [Indistinct talking] Renn? Hey. Hey. What happened? O.D.'d. Debbie from next door found me. I got ripped off. The coke and the pills. b*st*rd even took the necklace I got in Bali. Just... left me there. You know who? Well, the important thing is you're okay. I'm gonna find out who did this to me. And you're gonna get him. What? You hurt him. I will make it worth your while. Just rest, okay? Yeah. [Door closes] Smurf : Aren't you gonna come kiss me good night? Nicky stayed over. I told her she could. You don't mind, do you? Come. I made something for you. You know, this morning, you told me the boys didn't do anything behind my back. That isn't true, is it? [Chuckles] You're a good liar, kiddo. I didn't expect that. But you are your mother's son, huh? You know the mistake I made with her? I gave her too many chances.
