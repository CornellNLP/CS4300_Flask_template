 I got seven other cases full of jewelry and other sh1t. 
  How did you manage to find it? 
  She had a secret storage unit. 
  Smurf's in jail 'cause of me. 
  I had her arrested for murder. 
  I dug up his body, shot him with one of Smurf's guns, threw in the gun with him, and I called in a tip to the cops. 
  What now? 
  What... 
  Now we got 20 years worth of stuff she hoarded to fence, not including the buildings. 
  We sell those equal shares, we're set for life.

  Hands up! 
  Hands up! 
  Go to Wilson right away and get that power of attorney. 
  She's also gonna give you an envelope. 
  She's gonna tell you where to drop it so I stay safe in here. 
  I think we should put the Seagaze property up for sale. 
  You no longer have the authority to do that. 
  What's gonna happen when Baz finds out I have power of attorney? 
  As long as you don't sign anything, you'll be fine.

  She wanted to stay with Pope. 
  [ Seabird calling ] 
  She still upset about Smurf? 
  What time did you get up? 
  I was up early. 
  You're worried. 
  J? 
  Smurf's in the kid's head. 
  She's screwing with him. 
  With all of 'em. 
  I want to go down to Tijuana. 
  I wanna start looking for a place. 
  We should go, not come back. 
  You have plenty of what you took back from Smurf. 
  Not yet. 
  Not until I get my share of what she stole from us. 
  The buildings, the investments, cars... 
  everything that bitch took. 
  I want what's mine.

  Smurf won't protect you.

  She only protects herself. 
  [ Breathes deeply ] 
  [ Chuckles ] 
  You know, Smurf had this boyfriend once. 
  He was a real shithead, but he was her in on a property deal. 
  Foreclosure on a condo complex in Del Mar. 
  Slick real estate creep. 
  Had him hanging around the house, getting him high, sleeping with him. 
  So the shithead takes a liking to your mom. 
  She was screwed up already by then. 
  16. 
  Painkillers. 
  Out of her mind most of the time. 
  Pope and I were trying to get her straightened out, into rehab. 
  But Smurf wouldn't pay. 
  Said it cost too much. 
  She'd lecture her about personal choice and willpower, all that bullshit. 
  So one night, the creepy guy is hanging around the house, and he jumps her out by the pool. 
  Pope found him on top of her, pounding away, so high she was basically unconscious. 
  [ Chuckles ] 
  Pope beat the sh1t out of him with a croquet mallet. 
  Almost killed him. 
  Guy took off. 
  Smurf was furious because she lost the condo deal. 
  Raged at Pope for weeks. 
  And nine months later, you popped out.

  A mill, maybe more. 
  Is that my discounted rate? 
  There is no discounted rate. 
  Did you get me bail? 
  The fake passports and the bag of cash from the car? 
  That is gonna put you right in the judge's textbook, next to the definition of "flight risk." Smurf, you do know you're gonna be here for a while. 
  Oh. 
  What's "a while"? 
  Six months, maybe? 
  A year? 
  So Baz didn't say that he was definitely your dad, right? 
  Just that he could be. 
  What does it say on your birth certificate? 
  Nothing. 
  It's just blank. 
  She didn't even bother to name me. 
  Where my name's supposed to be, it just says "Baby Cody." Well, maybe that's what she was planning on calling you.

  Seeing Smurf in jail? 
  She's probably already got the place wired. 
  Running the cell block, controlling all the action, getting the guards to work for her. 
  They got Mexican gang sh1t in there now, man. 
  Then the gangs should be worried about Smurf, not the other way around. 
  Why you think Baz didn't discuss setting her up with us first? 
  He was gonna do it, with or without us, man. 
  He doesn't give a sh1t what we think. 
  He's willing to do that to Smurf, he could do that to us, too. 
  I mean, Pope did time for Baz.
