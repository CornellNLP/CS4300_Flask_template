 J : Um... Mom OD'd. She died. 
 Smurf : Sweetheart, why don't you just go and pack up your things. 
 You remember your uncles, don't you, J? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What makes you think that we can trust this kid? 
 The kid is in until I say he isn't. 
 J, can you hear me? What hap...? 
 You just ruined my surprise. 
 Pope : So, what are we planning next? 
 J, she died? 
 Just toss me a bone, man. Smurf doesn't have to know. 
 They need a car for the thing. 
 [Panting] 
 Baz : The car, Pope. Nothing else. 
 You don't remember our faces. I know where you live. 
 DNA jackpot. 
 Craig : Uh, oh, sh1t!

 Get him! 
 Do it! Get in there! 
 Man down! 
 You all right? 
 Little prick. 
 Yeah! 
 You okay? 
 You do that, you're gonna get hit. 
 That's his way of saying sorry. 
 ♪♪ 
 Oh! 
 Oh, Jesus. Not this sh1t again. 
 Hey. Who are you rooting for, Ma? 
 Both of them, baby. That's the beauty of being a mother. 
 You never have to pick sides. 
 Come on, honey. Why don't you help me with the food trays? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 You all right? 
 Hey. 
 I scored. You got to drink. 
 Baz : Give him a break, man. 
 It's barely noon, and the kid's already had six. 
 Drink. It's the rules. 
 [Coughs] 
 God, do you always cook like this? 
 My boys have big appetites. 
 Here. 
 If you were shipwrecked on a desert island and you could only choose one, who would you pick? 
 Other than J, of course. 
 Just asking. You're a beautiful young girl. 
 scoffs : Baz is pretty cool.

 Hey. Sorry I'm late. 
 Got Lena's nose spray. 
 You're smoking again, huh? 
 What? 
 That security guard died, and he wasn't just a security guard. He was a real cop in Long Beach moonlighting to support his family. 
 It's been playing nonstop. 
 I only called like 10 times. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. We were... we were... we were talking about the next job. 
 [Sighs] All right, well, I got to get to work. Lena's napping. 
 Hey, I can't stay here now. I got to get home and game this out. 
 Home? 
 [Sighs] 
 You know what I mean. I can take Lena with. 
 No. I will get Krystal to take her. 
 Not Krystal, no. 
 Smurf will be fine. She can just, you know... 
 What, put her in the corner eating candy while you figure out what to do about the cop you killed? 
 Jesus. 
 Cath. 
 Please? 
 I got to wake Lena up and go. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes, Catherine, he left an hour ago. 
 Baz : It's me. Turn on channel 2. 
 Why? 
 Smurf, just turn it on. Now. 
 If you're just gonna lie there, I can do this myself. 
 I'm sorry. It's... it's... 
 It's throbbin'. 
 You used to be worth not surfing. 
 Oh, come on. 
 It reeks, too. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 You might have to get it drained. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Renn... 
 God, I need a shower. 
 [Grunts] 
 You, uh... 
 You think I could get some more oxy? 
 [Scoffs] What, are you dealing my drugs now? Is that what this is? 
 No. Jesus. 
 I just sold you 20 yesterday. Between that and the coke, you have enough to OD... twice. 
 I'm big. I got to take more. 
 Face the wall. 
 What? 
 Just do it. 
 Hmm? 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Here. 
 Just leave the cash in there. 
 Uh... 
 I'll be flush in a day or two. 
 Unh-uh. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You know I'm good for it. 
 sh1t. Fine. 
 Don't die on me, okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 At least not until you pay me. 
 [Scrubbing] 
 [Groans] 
 [Groans] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Smurf : Oh, that's all right, sweetie. 
 I raised four boys. I've seen a lot worse. 
 [Groans] 
 Why don't you lay back down for another sec, J. 
 Something's happened, J, something that involves all of us. 
 You're in this family now. 
 You're gonna be seeing things, hearing things that need to stay in this family. 
 Do you get it? 
 Smart kid. Of course you do. 
 We never set out to hurt anyone. That's not the way we work. 
 We don't take stupid risks, and we're not greedy. 
 But we're human. 
 Sometimes one of these rules get's broken. 
 Now today we have to deal with the consequences of that. 
 Are you gonna be okay? 
 Good boy. 
 And if you're not, you just come to me. 
 There are no secrets in this family, not from one another. 
 Especially not from me. 
 Come on, let's get you out of these filthy things. 
 Ugh. Pants next. 
 You need me to help you stand? 
 J, I need you to go find Deran. 
 I got hold of the other boys, but I think he's probably surfing. 
 I need you to bring him home. 
 Underwear? 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Groans] 
 Oh. 
 [Man shouts] 
 Get in here, man! 
 Come on, this guy tried to take my wallet! 
 [Grunting] 
 Help me! Come on! 
 Piece of sh1t. 
 Come up from surfing, this guy's going through my truck, throws my wallet on the seat. 
 Like a dipshit, he runs in there. 
 What are you doing here, man? 
 Ah, Smurf sent me. She, uh... she needs you home right away, man. 
 Oh, yeah? Why's that? 
 She didn't say. 
 Hey, throw your bike in the back. I'll give you a lift. 
 Nah, man. I like to ride. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Horn honking] 
 [Honking continues] 
 Come here, J! 
 Where you going? 
 Hey, J! 
 Sure you don't want a ride, buddy? 
 Come on, man! Get in the car! 
 Come on! I'll give you a ride! Get in the car! 
 See you back at the house. 
 We have to destroy the watches. 
 Craig : What? No! 
 It's too dangerous to sell them. 
 They're worth at least 100 grand. 
 There's not a fence in the world that won't flip over the death of a cop. 
 Guy was an idiot, jumping on the car like that. 
 You shouldn't have done the job in the first place. 
 Oh, that's great. Real helpful. Thank you, Pope. 
 Or let Einstein scout the security company patrol schedule. 
 Oh, eat sh1t, Pope. 
 Okay, that's enough. 
 What about the other guard? Are you sure he can't ID you? 
 I don't think so. 
 You don't think so. 
 No. He can't. It happened too fast, and he was behind us. He was blasting away. No. 
 And the tweakers. You wore your masks, right? 
 Yeah. Except when we grabbed them. 
 Why would they buy drugs off guys in ski masks? 
 Because they're shithead tweakers. 
 Which is exactly why they wouldn't remember. 
 You better hope not, since you let them go. 
 Baz : That was the plan, Pope. 
 The cops match the DNA, they arrest them, not us. 
 If they find them dead in the desert with bullets in their heads... maybe not the cleanest misdirect. 
 What about the Range Rover? You sure no one saw you take it? 
 Pope : Yeah. The alley was empty, plus the street light was out. 
 Why was J all banged up when you got home? 
 You don't believe me? 
 Ask him. 
 I... 
 He stopped short on the way back. 
 I didn't have my seat belt on, so my face hit the dash. 
 He's right. No one saw us. 
 Okay. 
 Kilmer's got it in 50 pieces by now. 
 We... we... we couldn't get to Kilmer's. 
 W-we... we had to drop it in the salvage yard, the one we used for the bank. 
 So, the car with Craig's blood and a dead cop's bullets in it is sitting in San Pedro waiting to be found? 
 I was worried Craig was gonna bleed out. I had to make the call. I made the call. 
 You two are going back to that car. 
 You're gonna strip it, bleach it, chop it in 10 pieces, and then throw it into the goddamn ocean. 
 No. No, why... why us? 
 It was Baz's call. Baz made the call. 
 He wouldn't have had to if you hadn't screwed up in the first place. 
 What about him? 
 Huh? He's a part of the family now. 
 W-why is he getting a free ride? 
 W-why do we always have to do the grunt work? It's bullshit. 
 J, after school tomorrow, help your uncles with the car, okay? 
 Sure. 
 You happy now, sweetie? 
 Hey. 
 Pope lied to Smurf. 
 The owner of the Range Rover tried to stop me, then Pope beat him up with a flashlight. 
 You tell Smurf? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 Good. You did the right thing. 
 Always come to me first, okay? 
 What? 
 Pope checked his license to find out where he lived. 
 Is he gonna do something to him? 
 What kind of family do you think we are, man? 
 I got it from here. 
 [Grunting] 
 You said you'd redo this while I was in prison. 
 Oh, I figured we'd all be better off if you had something to smash when you got out. 
 Pretty tough on me with Smurf. 
 Just being honest. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 That's funny. 
 What'd that little sh1t tell you? 
 Did he tell you I saved his ass? 
 The guy was about to kill him. 
 You should have told Smurf, man. 
 [Laughs] 
 She was asking about loose ends. 
 There are none. 
 Meaning what, Pope? What... w-w... 
 I took care of it. I scared the guy. 
 What does that mean? 
 I scared the guy. 
 He couldn't ID us if we went up and kissed him. 
 Well, you still should have said something. 
 The only loose end is J. 
 I told you we couldn't trust him. 
 He's just a kid, man. What did you expect him to do? 
 Ease up on him, and then we'll see. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Grunts] 
 
 
 
 He cornered Craig this morning. 
 Wanted to know where you grabbed the tweakers. 
 Did he tell him? 
 Craig's not that dumb. 
 Good. 
 I don't think he's sleeping. 
 He never checked into the motel room we got him. 
 You mean he's wandering around the house all night? 
 Or God knows where. 
 And what's he saying about J? 
 He's still convinced we can't trust him. 
 [Banging] 
 Deran : Hey! What are doing up there? 
 What, are you jerking off? Can you go any slower? 
 You try working with one arm. 
 Yeah, well, at least Smurf knows we did something right. 
 If we had taken you to a doctor, ugh, with all the heat on this right now, cops would be all over us. 
 And you know what? 
 Look on the bright side. 
 At least we can be broke now, too. 
 I'm sick of it, man. 
 I'm serious. 
 We do all the hard work, and she controls the cash? 
 Nah, man. Nah. 
 I'm pulling my own jobs if this keeps up. 
 You know? You and me, man. 
 What do you think about that? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm in. 
 You know, I would love to see Smurf on her knees right now, getting metal sparks in her hair and sh1t. 
 And Pope and Baz, where the hell are they? 
 You know, Pope... fine, I get it. 
 He'd probably cut off his own hand to see what it looks like. 
 But Baz... Oh, sh1t. 
 God forbid Baz gets his hands dirty. 
 No way. Not her favorite, Baz. 
 What are you doing? You working or what? 
 I got to piss. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Pope : Where is it? 
 The watch I gave you. 
 You heard Smurf. 
 I gave it to Nicky. You told me to. 
 Get it back. 
 What else are you hiding? 
 I'm not hiding anything. 
 That was my go-to when I was your age. 
 Hid all sorts of sh1t in there from her. 
 Well, get dressed. I'll take you to school. 
 Um, Nicky's taking me, but thank you. 
 She called Smurf when you were showering. I said we'd pick her up. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Metal clangs] 
 [Gate opens, closes] 
 [Car door closes] 
 ♪ 'Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud ♪ 
 Whoa, nice! 
 I blew through a stop sign the other day. 
 My mom almost had a seizure. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, she's like the queen bitch of the fun police. 
 Even my dad is sick of her, and he's about as fun as Ebola. 
 He just made O-5 lieutenant commander, and I'm like, "Great, cool. Christmas in Cabo." 
 And even he was game, but of course she talked him out of it. 
 How much do you need for Cabo? 
 I don't know. Like 2 grand? 
 So steal it. Rob a bank. 
 I'm serious. 
 Get some cash, drive yourself down to Cabo. You're old enough. 
 You deserve Cabo. 
 [Chuckles] My parents would so come after me. 
 Not if you tied them up. 
 You could do it while they're sleeping. 
 Do your dad first. 
 [Laughs] 
 Jesus, J. You didn't tell me your uncle was psycho. 
 That's a cool watch. 
 Thanks. J gave it to me. 
 Oh, sh1t. Wow, man. 
 Yeah, and I'll never take it off. 
 Catch. 
 Time for an upgrade. 
 Can buy my own phone, Smurf. 
 Why, I can't buy you a gift? 
 Can't be calling Cath every time I want you, not that she knows where you are half the time anyway. 
 Well, thank you, Mother. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Pope tossed J's room this morning. 
 [Sighs] 
 Looking for what? 
 He said J did it, and he took my truck and he drove J to school. 
 I thought trying to stop him might make it a little bit worse. 
 Yeah. 
 You think we can get him back on those meds again? 
 You remember what happened last time we suggested that? 
 Listen... You know we don't have to do this. 
 We are not gonna starve to death. 
 Sweetie, it's not worth the risk. 
 Throw the watches in, Barry. 
 Okay. 
 Lena : Is this a good clown or a bad clown? 
 Lena? 
 It looks like a bad clown. 
 ♪♪ 
 What are you doing here? 
 I brought Lena a present. 
 You never answered my letter. 
 Which one? 
 I mean, there were a hell of a lot... 
 You know which one. 
 What was I supposed to say? 
 Maybe you thought I didn't mean it. 
 You got to go now. Okay? Baz... He could be here any minute. 
 I've meant it since we were kids. 
 Which is why... 
 Yeah, no. You've... you've made this bigger in your mind. 
 Nope. 
 You liked it, too. 
 I was angry. Baz and I were fighting. I was drunk. I... 
 I had a new baby. 
 It was no big deal. At least, not for me. 
 Have you told Baz? 
 No, because it was no big deal. 
 Maybe I should tell him. 
 Tell Daddy what? 
 That I love him, sweetheart. 
 And I-I need people to know that and be happy for us. 
 Please. 
 Baby? 
 Yes? 
 Do you remember our secret word? 
 Snowflake. 
 That's right. 
 And you remember what to do? 
 Good. Don't forget it. 
 So, there's the frequency. 
 Who can tell me the wavelength? 
 Okay. Uh, could someone at least shout out the wrong answer? 
 And from the ashes of ignorance we can pluck out a little learning? 
 Come on, guys. 
 It's 588 nanometers. 
 That is not the wrong answer, Josh. 
 [School bell rings] 
 Okay. Lab's due Friday. No late labs. 
 Hey. Hang back a sec. 
 I, um... I heard about your mom. 
 I just wanted to check in, see if you're all right. 
 Yeah. I'm fine, thanks. 
 Yeah? 
 Where are you living? 
 With my grandmother and my uncles. 
 And is that... feeling okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Good. You're lucky to have family. 
 You're an excellent student, Josh. 
 I'd hate to see that change. 
 If you need any special help, I'm here for you, okay? 
 Thank you, Ms. Anderson. 
 You can call me Alexa outside of class. 
 If you want. 
 And you, uh, might want to let Nicky do her own homework once in a while. 
 It'd be good for her. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What took so long? 
 You got to do your own homework. 
 No! 
 She knows.

 Oh, Jonah, thank God you're home. 
 I'm so sorry to bother you, but look... 
 I just tripped on my front walk. 
 I know. I'm late for a meeting in Del Mar, and like an idiot, I locked my keys in the house. 
 My maid's on her way down, but I was wondering... 
 Could I use your bathroom just to clean up just for a minute? 
 Do I know... 
 Oh. 
 I'm sorry. I don't... I don't... 
 Jonah, do you not recognize me? 
 Oh, I'm... I'm Lynne. Lynne Lambert. 
 I live right next to the Morellis. 
 Miriam : Neeny, hurry! 
 Come on. Hurry. Hurry. 
 You know why we do all the sh1t work and Baz and Smurf do all the planning? 
 It's 'cause she thinks we're the dumb ones. 
 Uh-huh. 
 And now J, and all of his science books and sh1t, she's gonna think he's a genius, too. 
 How you doing up there? 
 What, are you using your teeth? 
 I don't hear any tools. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 What's going on with you? 
 B-b-bro... 
 What, are you high? You haven't done sh1t. 
 I think I took too many painkillers, man. 
 How bad is it? Let's see. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Let's see it. 
 [Winces] 
 Ohh. 
 It hurts like a bitch. 
 You need to go down south. 
 Right, so Smurf can accuse me of not doing my share? 
 If you need to go to Mexico, you got to go. 
 Already blaming me for getting shot, you for screwing up the recon. 
 Whoa, I didn't screw up the recon, okay? Those guards were never there before. 
 Let's just get that straight. 
 Come on, man. Let's just get this over with. 
 Nah, screw it. 
 Even with the both of us working on this, this is gonna take three days. 
 Let's just burn it.

 It's metal. 
 Yeah, not reduce it to ash, dumb-ass. 
 No, fire will wipe it clean.

 [Pope grunting] 
 He's worse than ever. 
 Hey, what happened to that phone I just gave you? I tried calling you today. 
 Yeah. I was walking on the beach. I didn't hear it. Sorry. 
 Then put it down your pants on vibrate. When I call, you answer. 
 Got it. 
 They put out a reward now... $25k for information. 
 They don't have anything. 
 If they had anything real, they would have been here by now. 
 We lie low, don't get stupid... We're gonna be okay. 
 Yeah, except burning the watches and holding off on other jobs is not gonna play so well. 
 You have cash you can give to Deran and Craig? 
 Craig will only put it up his nose. 
 I'll make sure his rent is paid and take care of Deran and Pope. 
 What about you, baby? How are you set? 
 I'm okay for a while. 
 Not too long. 
 Okay. Everything went according to plan. 
 Except for these, but, hey, anything for the team, right? 
 You know, those are gonna heal in two or three days. 
 A murder conviction sometimes takes a little longer. 
 Where's J? 
 Oh, we dropped him at his girlfriend's. 
 He won't be home for dinner? 
 Oh, you know what, I forgot to ask, but maybe it's because I don't give a sh1t. 
 And where's Craig? 
 What am I, a GPS? I don't know. 
 He's probably snorting himself stupid because three days after he got shot his lovely mother made him go out in the middle of toxic frickin' nowhere to cut up a car one-handed. 
 I mean, the kid is spending a lot of time at his girlfriend's, isn't he? 
 Okay, now you sound like Pope. 
 Well, there's a dead cop now. 
 I had a talk with J. He will be fine. 
 Are those for Pope? 
 I thought you said your hookup at the pharmacy dried up. 
 Remember Pope's old shrink, the one he tried to stab? 
 I borrowed a few of his files and paid a visit to one of his patients. 
 Had to improvise a little bit today. 
 Ah. So you stole them. 
 We did things, baby, you and me, right? 
 Things your brothers never had to do. 
 When I first took you in, do you remember? 
 You used to steal food from the kitchen, and hide it all around the house. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I think it took you about a year to believe I was gonna feed you regularly. 
 God, your parents were sh1ts. 
 I don't know how you survived. 
 [Sighs] 
 You locked both the doors. 
 Uh, sh1t. I'm sorry. 
 I would call, but I-I didn't wanna... you know, and wake up Lena. 
 You still pissed at me for yesterday? 
 No. I... 
 I just spaced out. 
 Cath. 
 [Water running] 
 [Water stops] 
 That cop's funeral was huge. 
 Did you see it on TV? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 They're gonna need to arrest someone. 
 Yeah, maybe someone, but it ain't gonna be us. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm sure. We cleaned it all up. 
 Hey. 
 I promise. 
 We cleaned it all up. 
 If SWAT breaks down the door in the middle of the night, you'll get on the floor and let them cuff you. 
 Cath, come on. 
 Promise me. 
 I don't want Lena to get shot because her parents are just stupid. 
 We're not those people, Baz. We're not. 
 Okay. 
 I promise. 
 I promise. 
 [chuckles] Jesus. 
 What's this? 
 She saw it in, um, the supermarket. 
 What supermarket? It's like something out of a Mexican horror movie. 
 How about a giraffe or something next time?
