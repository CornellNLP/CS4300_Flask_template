 This thing is happening, with or without you. 
 You're breaking up with me? 
 You don't know what's going on here. 
 You're using her, right? 
 Yes. 
 There's 5 grand in there. 
 I can't take this. 
 You already did. 
 Your friend Vin just came to my house. 
 How does he know where I live? 
 Catherine's not your wife. 
 Maybe you just thought I'd never get out, so you promised me sh1t you couldn't deliver. 
 I'm about to present you with an opportunity. 
 How'd you like to make some real money? 
 Catherine, you okay? 
 Is he your boyfriend? 
 He's a brother. 
 If that happens again, you can call me. 
 Can you be my friend right now and not a cop? 
 So, the last people to inform on the Codys burned to death. 
 [Metal clanging] 
 Damn. 
 This place hasn't changed since we were kids, right down to the busted cameras. 
 So, you're saying a monkey could do what we just did? 
 Yeah. He goes in, he steals watches and iPhones and sh1t. 
 Sounds like Internet bullshit to me. 
 Then why did I see it on TV? 
 Well, how does he know what to steal? 
 Because he's got a guy training him to do it. 
 What if he sees something a monkey wants more than an iPhone? 
 Comes back to the guy with, like, a nut and a pencil? 
 I think you're reading into it too much. 
 It's just a good story. I wanted to tell it to you. 
 I don't know. I found it a little undermining. 
 You know what? Maybe you can get a monkey when you get your cut. 
 Yo, we clear half of what Baz thinks he will tomorrow, I'm buying a new Ducati. 
 1299 Panigale. 
 And a boat. You? 
 I'm thinking maybe a condo and some stocks through Smurf's guy. 
 Seriously? 
 Yeah. 
 It's called forward thinking, bud. 
 We're adults.

 If we do this right, no one on the base knows anything's missing. 
 It takes months for the ATMs on the ship to get through all that cash. 
 Except for bad lieutenant here. He knows. 
 Smurf : When does the cash arrive on the base? 
 Tomorrow. It's only there for a day. 
 And that's our window, when it's in one of these buildings here before it gets put on the ship. 
 Not "one of these." It's Building 13. 
 Right. 
 Any alarms? 
 Yes. 
 The doors, windows? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Fire? 
 Yeah, why? 
 The sprinklers. 
 What about the perimeter of the base? 
 Cameras and military police. 
 How many cameras? 
 A lot. 
 There's no blind spots in the fence. 
 And once we're inside? 
 No cameras, just patrols. 
 Oh, no problem then, just patrols. 
 It's just patrols. 
 Smurf : What about the gates? 
 Civilian access here for all the businesses on the base, including paintball. 
 All IDs run through NCIC. 
 So no criminal records. 
 Vehicle searches? 
 In and out, even for officers. 
 Paul, what's that gate right there? 
 That is the Navy nod to community relations. 
 That's a bike path, cuts through the middle of the base. 
 Could we get the money moved to Building 15? 
 I can't do that. 
 You said most of the supplies for the ship are stored in 15. 
 Provisions, not cash. 
 If I start redirecting the money, when they investigate, it leads right back to me. 
 There's gotta be a way. 
 Hell no! Absolutely not! 
 Lovers' quarrel? 
 Let's take a break. I'll put out lunch. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 You cutting all your classes or just mine? 
 You wearing a wire? 
 I made a buy from an undercover cop. 
 Then this detective comes along and says there's a way I don't get charged with a felony. 
 She talks about you, J. 
 And the danger you're in at your family's. 
 No, no, no, I was not in any danger until you got me to talk on a wire. 
 Josh, this detective has been investigating your family a long time. 
 Look, if I don't give her more soon, she's gonna know something's changed, and I'm gonna go to jail. 
 That's your problem. 
 What if there's a way out for both of us? 
 You said they're planning something, right? 
 If I call this detective, and you tell her everything you know, make it clear that you're not involved. 
 Then what? 
 Then they'll get arrested. 
 You'll get witness protection, and my charge will go away. 
 Do you think that it's that easy? 
 You don't know them. 
 They find out that I talked to the cops, you have no idea what they'll do to me. 
 Hey. You're scared. 
 That's normal. I get it. You got a lot on the line here. 
 This thing is in motion. 
 Look, we can stop this. 
 No, you don't want that. 
 Yes. 
 No, you don't. You don't want that. 
 You don't want that. Everything you told me about the ins and outs of the base, you made it happen. 
 [Laughs] 
 Are you threatening me? 
 No, never, because you want this. 
 You want what's on the other side. 
 Screw the money. 
 No, it's not about the money. 
 Well, yeah, it's about the money, but it's more than that. 
 It's pushing back. 
 It's going 130 instead of living your life, filling out forms, taking sh1t from people that should be taking sh1t from you. 
 Come on, I need the cash in Building 15 to get it off of the base. 
 That's not possible. 
 Okay, look. 
 What if it's not your idea? 
 Think about it. 
 What if you're just solving a problem? 
 [Plate clinks] 
 We got company. 
 What's she doing here? 
 That's all we need, Nicky finding her father here with us. 
 Go get rid of her. 
 Me, how? 
 She's a teenaged girl, baby. Figure it out. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 You looking for J? 
 No. 
 I was just gonna hang by the pool. 
 Can I still do that? 
 You can, or you can come with me to San Onofre. 
 Yeah, hell, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Whoo! 
 Paul's reconsidered. 
 I've got it covered. 
 [Sighs] 
 He'll move the money? 
 Well, one of us needs to get on the base... today. 
 Really? And how is that gonna happen? 
 No one with a record can get past security, and you don't want your fake IDs in the system before tomorrow. 
 Right. 
 But are you sure everyone in this family has a criminal record? 
 Tools only, right? 
 No guns, like we agreed. 
 No guns. 
 I will not get caught smuggling guns on the base. 
 Right. 
 And the money will not be in the car when I drive it back home? 
 Like we agreed. 
 If the money's in that car when I get it back, I will throw it in the base incinerator. 
 Absolutely. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 [Sighs] 
 J. 
 We gotta talk to you. 
 Come here. 
 What's up? 
 Come sit by me, baby. 
 You got a criminal record, honey? 
 You sure? 
 Not even for jacking a stereo, nothing? 
 Scoring for Julia? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 We need you to do something for us. 
 It's important. 
 The warning signs are loud and clear. 
 Guys like Pope turn violent. 
 You're in danger. 
 I know. 
 Listen, you're... y-y-you're not on your own. 
 You trust me, right? 
 Good. Good. 
 'Cause, um, I think I know somebody who can help you. 
 [Gasps] 
 What's going on? 
 Hello, Catherine. Detective Sandra Yates. 
 What the hell, Patrick? 
 I came to you as a friend. 
 We need to talk. I'm investigating the Codys. 
 This was a setup? 
 Just hear her out. 
 Just give us a minute. 
 Just listen. 
 I'm not saying sh1t to you. 
 Janine Cody killed your parents. 
 You think you can handle this? 
 Yeah. 
 It's the biggest job we've ever pulled. 
 It all rests on you. 
 We wouldn't ask you to do this if... 
 If had any other options. 
 ...we didn't believe you could pull it off. 
 Take this, too. 
 I set up the meeting with Vin Good. an hour from now. 
 You sure about this? 
 We don't have a choice. 
 We can't have any surprises in the next 48 hours. 
 Paul won't drive the money out? 
 It doesn't matter. We don't need him to. 
 What's this sh1t about no guns? 
 He's smart. 
 If we get caught, it limits his exposure. 
 He'll do less time. 
 After he rolls on us. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Look at this sh1t. 
 Deran said Smurf was up all night again. 
 That's every night since the weekend. 
 Where the hell does she go? 
 I don't know, but something messed her up. 
 We're taking guns, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Nicky : J's boning his teacher. 
 What? 
 That's why he broke up with me. 
 Damn, J. 
 That's sick. How old is she? 
 I don't know, 25, 26. 
 Thanks. 
 It's pretty hilarious that, uh, Baz and my dad are suddenly best buds. 
 Why? 
 My dad might be an idiot, but I'm not. 
 I know you guys aren't just into real estate. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah? 
 How's that? 
 Do you have any blow? 
 Yeah, but we can't do it here. 
 Where can we do it? 
 [Sighs] 
 Sandra : When Patrick told me you were in danger, I realized it was time to reach out. 
 Why didn't you arrest her, charge her with murder? 
 Smurf didn't set the fire, she made Pope do it. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You're lying. 
 Pope hated my parents, but he wouldn't kill them. 
 CCTV footage puts him near your house. 
 ATM at the Mobil? 
 He drove by 20 minutes before the fire got called in, then back by again 5 minutes after. 
 Must have driven right past the fire trucks. 
 Local PD brought him in for questioning. 
 He shows up with a lawyer. Smurf wouldn't say a word. 
 Smiling like he owned the world. 
 That sound like an innocent man to you? 
 You're right to fear these people. 
 Is this the part where you ask me to turn against the father of my kid? 
 Yes. 
 Tell me about the next job they're planning, and you and Lena get a new start. 
 Legal protection, resources, a shot at a new life. 
 Things got rough after the fire, didn't they? 
 That first foster father? What he did to you... 
 Group homes after? 
 You don't want Lena to have to go through that. 
 I'm done. 
 Baz and Pope were pretty close at the time of the fire. 
 There's no way Baz knew. 
 It's lucky you weren't home that night, wasn't it? 
 Offer's only good 24 hours. 
 Lena! 
 Baby, let's go. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 Man : I.D. 
 The bag. 
 You're good to go. 
 Thank you. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Keys jingle] 
 When'd you get back? 
 Last night. 
 Where you been? 
 I got picked up for a D and D. 
 They put me in detox at the jail. 
 I haven't had a drink in 11 days. 
 Right. 
 Thinking maybe I won't for a while. 
 Thanks for feeding the cat. 
 [Sighs] 
 That took you a while. 
 She was upset, needed to talk. 
 You spend two hours talking to Nicky about her feelings? 
 I got her out of here, right?

 I'm thinking about my parents.

 What about 'em? 
 Just, how on Sunday nights, if they weren't broke, we'd get burgers from Ruby's and go to the pier and watch people fish. 
 Probably lifting wallets off of tourists so they could go score. 
 I mean... 
 Probably. 
 But... 
 I know Smurf says they were just junkies, but I remember other things, too. 
 What I remember is you not being their priority. 
 Leaving you with strangers, not coming back for days, selling your clothes, selling your toys. 
 That's what I remember. 
 Are you still feeding your dad's cat? 
 Cause I've never heard a lot of good about him.

 I lost it on a guard. 
 Right after that, they were on me. 
 Hilty, the worst. 
 Put me in solitary, chained me naked to a chair, kept the lights on, music blasting, no sleep. 
 And then he'd take me back on to the block, parade me around, covered in sh1t... 
 ...and just when I'd think it was over, he put me back in there. 
 Are you sure Paul is solid? 
 Because once we're on the base, if something goes wrong, we can't just bail, and I'm not going back inside. 
 Hey, man. 
 I'm not going back in there. 
 I know, Pope, I got this. 
 Okay? 
 You said that before. 
 Pope. 
 I promise. 
 Morning, sweetheart. Are you okay? 
 He doesn't look okay.

 No, no, it's not that.

 Umm... 
 What? 
 Are you my dad?

 No one's saying anything. It just... 
 I don't know, man. It's just that sh1t is disturbing. 
 You should have drank more tequila, man. 
 I passed right out. 
 I don't know, man. Something feels weird, like there's... there's just something in the air.

 It's just, this is a big job. 
 We're taking a lot of risks.
