  So this is how you launder your money. 
  One of the ways. 
  You can't deposit stolen money into a bank, right? 
  Because bank deposits are tracked by the IRS.

  And then I have three houses that I rent out. 
  For free. 
  On the books, they bring in $5K. 
  Why do you rent them out for free? 
  Let's just say I rent them for services rendered. 
  I pay the boys their salary through the management company... 
  taxes, Social Security, pension plan, health insurance, all of it. 
  We're just another law-abiding family doing what we can to contribute to society. 
  So what's the job? 
  I just told you. 
  You want me to help you with the books? 
  Any idiot with a gun can pull a job.
