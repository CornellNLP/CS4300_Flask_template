 May we all get what we want... 
  All: And never what we deserve. 
  Why are we still letting her run sh1t? 
  We're not 12 anymore. 
  For real, let's walk. 
  She doesn't give a sh1t about any of us. 
  She just uses us to get what she wants. 
  We just gotta get a job together quick. 
  I was thinking New Canticle. 
  Ripping off a church? 
  What kind of sh1t karma's that gonna be? 
  That's 34 grand. 
  I just need some more time. 
  It's got to be the full 50, or else there's nothing I can do. 
  Manny said you'd still look good. 
  Manny's not gettin' another cent from me. 
  He's dying. 
  So whatever sh1t went on between you, you're gonna come say goodbye. 
  You really think she could have left me? 
  Maybe she found out about Lucy. 
  I know something happened. 
  She wouldn't leave. 
  We take all the risk. 
  And then on top of it, you decide the split. 
  That's not very fair here. 
  You know, when you showed up, you hadn't eaten a meal in a week. 
  Who's tried to convince your own sons that you're not the cold-hearted bitch you seem to be? 
  Me!
