  Oh, that's bullshit, man! 
  I did all the work! 
  Now you bring this sh1t into my bar, which is basically the only safe thing in my life. 
  What was I supposed to do? 
  Deal with it, man, for once! 
  You're the one that told Marco that we owed him. 
  Not me! 
  You! 
  I can't believe I'm gonna have to deal with this sh1t for the rest of my life. 
  Any time I-I'm remotely good at something, it can't be mine. 
  It has to be ours, always. 
  What are we talking about here? 
  Surfing? 
  No, we're not talking about surfing. 
  The only reason that you even got into that was because of me. 
  Okay, man. 
  I drove you to each and every one of your tournaments, wherever they were. 
  No, you drove me to the tournaments so you could tell the girls that you were my coach, so they'd sleep with you. 
  That's why. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  That's why. 
  And then... 
  and then I'd clean up your puke and sh1t and drive your drunk ass home at 14 years old. 
  You think Smurf was gonna get up at 4:00 and drive you to San Pedro? 
  You think Baz was? 
  Pope? 
  One of these days, you're gonna end up dead. 
  I can't spend the rest of my life making sure that doesn't happen. 
  So soon as I get enough money to buy this place, I'm out. 
  I'm serious. 
  I'm done.
