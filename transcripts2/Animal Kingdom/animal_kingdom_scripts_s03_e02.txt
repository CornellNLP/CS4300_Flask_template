 So, this is how you're laundering the money. 
  I want to learn. 
  Come here. 
  I want you to meet Morgan Wilson. 
  I want my grandson J given my power of attorney now. 
  Hey, taking one last shot at the Q.S. 
  What about school? 
  I'll make it up next semester. 
  See you when I get back. 
  Officer Collins: Do you know a Barry Blackwell? 
  Yeah, he's my brother. 
  We were responding officers to a shooting last night. 
  He was found with several gunshot wounds to his chest. 
  I can't believe Baz is dead. 
  Lena: My dad's dead? 
  Nicky: Who's gonna take care of Lena? 
  Does she end up in foster care? 
  She's not going into foster care. 
  J, I need you to pay those people I asked you to pay. 
  J: Yeah, I already did. 
  I need you to pay them again. 
  How are you? 
  Good to see you! 
  Sit down. 
  Let me make you something. 
  Do you mind if I use your bathroom real quick? 
  Go ahead.

  Smurf's got a lot of bills that I'm not sure how to cover. 
  You have to pay the bills. 
  Tens of thousands of dollars run through Smurf's buildings every month. 
  If rent stops just because Smurf goes to jail, it might give the cops the impression that her real-estate business is nothing more than a money-laundering operation. 
  Have you talked to your uncles? 
  They won't work, not for Smurf. 
  If I wanted to sell a building, how would I do that? 
  Oh, you can't. 
  Not right now, anyway. 
  The D.A.'s looking into Smurf's finances. 
  You sell a building, it gives them a more complete picture of her business. 
  Although we could do a private sale. 
  What's that? 
  Well, you sign over several properties to a corporation in my name. 
  I get a mortgage on it, I front Goodwin the cash, I give some to you to cover the bills. 
  But that would mean that you own the properties. 
  We could sort that out when Smurf gets out. 
  If she gets out. 
  No. 
  Not yet. 
  I'll let you know if it comes to that.
