 [WAITRESS] 
 Kitchen's closing in a minute, folks. 
 Can I get you anything else? 
 - Um, banana split, please. 
 - I think I'll try the banana split. 
 Ha! 
 Cute. 
 Coming right up, both of you. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 - [LAUGHING] 
 - Night owl, huh? 
 Not usually. 
 I just... 
 I have lots of paperwork to finish tonight. 
 All right. 
 Yeah. 
 I thought part of being a grownup     meant no more homework. 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 Just selling my mom's house. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, I just... 
 Did she... 
 - I mean, uh... 
 - She passed away a few years ago. 
 It's been kind of hard to let go. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Thanks. 
 You live here? 
 Um... 
 I live in California now, but I grew up just a few blocks from here. 
 You? 
 Oh, I've lived in a lot of places, but I live in California now, too. 
 - Van Nuys, right there in Los Angeles. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 Me and my boy. 
 Valley Village. 
 I'm Barbara, by the way. 
 Pardon me. 
 Pat. 
 - Pat? 
 Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 So what brings you out here? 
 Well, I'm just kind of passing through. 
 I'm on a hunt. 
 Or a... 
 I collect old cars. 
 - Oh, wow. 
 - Yeah. 
 [WAITRESS] 
 Would you believe it, we only have one banana left. 
 Fred used most of 'em in the pies. 
 I'm fine. 
 You take it. 
 Thank you. 
 I have a better idea.

 [COSMIC STAFF POWERING DOWN] 
 [SCREAMS] 
 What? 
 - What the hell is going on? 
 What is that thing? 
 - [PAT] 
 Okay. 
 I realize that's gotta look pretty darn weird, Barbara, but... 
 Oh! 
 That... 
 - Okay. 
 - That's a broom. 
 From Sharper Image. 
 No. 
 I'm telling her the truth, Court. 
 Right now. 
 Fine. 
 It's not a broom. 
 - It belonged to Starman. 
 - It's Dad's. 
 [BARBARA] 
 What? 
 Would you please just let me do the explaining... 
 Dad was a superhero, and now I'm a superhero, too. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, don't lead with that. 
 - What that is... 
 - Jordan Mahkent killed Dad. 
 What is she talking about? 
 [PAT] 
 All right. 
 Just... 
 Let me start at the beginning. 
 Stripesy? 
 - You? 
 - [COURTNEY] 
 Hmm. 
 It was a long time ago. 
 He goes by STRIPE now. 
 Oh, now? 
 You go by STRIPE now? 
 Occasionally. 
 And Jordan Mahkent... 
 Mom, listen. 
 Jordan, my boss, is the Iceman. 
 Icicle. 
 And he's behind everything bad going on in Blue Valley. 
 He killed Dad. 
 Your dad, who was Starman? 
 Are you crazy? 
 - Filling my kid's head with this nonsense? 
 - Mom! 
 Telling her that her father was a superhero? 
 That Blue Valley's some hideout for a supervillain gang? 
 Barbara, I realize it doesn't make sense    
 - unless you know all the facts... 
 - Pat didn't do anything. 
 - The Staff chose me. 
 - Courtney,     
 - go upstairs. 
 - Being Stargirl is my birthright. 
 Starman is not your father. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I know he told you his name was Sam Kurtis, but that was just an alias. 
 This is my dad. 
 Sylvester Pemberton. 
 Starman. 
 He was a member of the Justice Society. 
 And the reason he didn't show up on Christmas... 
 No, enough! 
 The proof is right here. 
 Do not touch that thing. 
 But, Mom, it... 
 Will you just go to your room, [VOICE BREAKING] right now! 
 Look. 
 I realize that this is a lot to process. 
 If this lunacy of you being an assistant superhero... 
 Sidekick. 
 I was a sidekick. 
 If this is remotely true... 
 then our whole marriage is a lie. 
 That's not true, Barb. 
 Everything we are together is real. 
 This family is real. 
 You dragged my daughter into this insanity. 
 You told her that her father was Starman. 
 I wanted this stuff to stay in the past! 
 None of this was supposed to happen! 
 Tell me one thing, Pat. 
 One true thing. 
 When Courtney was hurt, and you took her to the hospital... 
 was that really from a car accident? 
 No. 
 You need to go. 
 - Barbara... 
 - Get out of this house. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [HENRY] 
 Dad. 
 I remember. 
 It was last month, I remember you blowing out six candles. 
 Where have the last ten years gone? 
 How could I forget ten years? 
 - I don't know. 
 - My memory... 
 It will come back. 
 It has to. 
 Why are we here? 
 You had a seizure. 
 No. 
 I mean... 
 in Nebraska? 
 You moved us here after Mom died. 
 Merry? 
 She's... 
 You don't remember? 
 A long time ago, um... 
 there was an accident. 
 She drowned. 
 I see. 
 [BREATH TREMBLING, SIGHS] 
 She was supposed to pick me up from school that day. 
 And I was scared that she had forgotten about me. 
 You said you found her in the pool. 
 You said that she was ice cold. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] 
 [DR. KING] 
 I loved her. 
 [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] 
 [HENRY] 
 Can you hear me, Dad? 
 [DR. KING] Junior? 
 You have my gift? 
 [RINGING STOPS] 
 Did I know this? 
 Was I teaching you? 
 No. 
 It started when you were in a coma. 
 I may have been trying to reach out, triggering your latent abilities. 
 I know... 
 how frightening these powers can be when they first develop. 
 I'm going to help you, son. 
 [SIGHS] 
 - [MIKE] Dad? 
 - [PAT] 
 Yeah? 
 Dad, wait! 
 Is everything okay with Barb? 
 I heard her. 
 She sounded upset. 
 I can't explain it right now, okay, Mike, but, um... 
 I'm gonna go spend the night at the garage. 
 Just, uh, get a good night sleep. 
 All right? 
 And I'll be back in the morning. 
 And then what? 
 Well, Mike... 
 Uh... 
 I don't know, Mike. 
 Wait, uh... 
 Are you guys gonna get a divorce? 
 I hope not. 
 I'll come with you. 
 - No, it's okay. 
 - Come on. 
 You're my dad. 
 I'll come with you. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 And you know, Mike... 
 I don't know if I tell you this enough, but... 
 Don't get all shaky on me, big guy. 
 I'm gonna go pack a bag. 
 Well... 
 I love you. 
 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
 [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] 
 [DR. KING] 
 Merry... 
 No! 
 Merry! 
 Last day... 
 I loved her... 
 Drowned... My wife... Last day... 
 So beautiful... 
 Last day, Jordan, Starman... 
 Dad... 
 [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] 
 Dad... 
 [JORDAN] 
 Henry. 
 It's good to see you, old friend.    
 My wife is dead. Just like that. Merry's... gone. I guess I never talked much about her, did I? We met while I was robbing a bank. A bank, of all things. Such a cliché. "Merry... The Girl of  ,    Gimmicks", the papers called her. And me, the terrible telepath, "Brainwave". I was stunned by her thoughts. They were so... pure. So good. So different than everyone else's, it gave me pause. And she caught me. In more ways than one. Seeing the world through Merry's eyes made me question Jordan and his mission. But Jordan couldn't allow that. He led the Justice Society of America to us. And we killed them. Including Merry's brother... Starman. Starman? I knew she would never forgive me for playing a part in it. I hoped she would go into hiding. But she didn't. Damn you, Jordan. There are no more good thoughts to be found. Merry is dead. Jordan. [DOOR CLOSES] [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] We can't go out right now. My mom's already too upset. [WARBLES] Go back to your crate. [WARBLING IN DESPAIR] [JORDAN] It's taken the better part of a decade, But Project: New America is finally on the precipice of becoming a reality. Dr. Ito's machine is near completion. All it needs now is you. Your power, and we can take control of every poisoned mind in six states. We'll carve out the heart of America, and we'll control it. Can you imagine, Henry? Reshaping that many thoughts? Helping them to see the light. Our light. Our way. What about this "Stargirl"? The one that put me here? Who is she? [WARBLING] [GRUNTS] [COSMIC STAFF WARBLES] [FREEZING] [CHUCKLES] You're not much without your master, are you? I'm so curious. When did you come from? Is that Starman's staff? Come with me, Henry. All your questions will be answered. Dr. Ito will help you remember. [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] What is it? Nothing. [FOOTSTEPS] Where's the Staff? It's not downstairs! Well, hopefully, Pat took it. Mom, that Staff might be the only thing that can stop Icicle! And I'm the only one who can use it! We're leaving. Leaving? I have been up all night. And I don't know what is true or what's a lie, but I know I don't want you anywhere near Blue Valley. Or Pat. Mom, please. You have to understand, he was only trying to help me get justice for Dad! Starman was not your father. You're wrong. I'm going to work. Mom, you can't go to work. Jordan Mahkent is there, and he killed Dad and a lot of other people! Go start packing. I'll be back in an hour. [BANGING ON DOOR] - Is my staff in there? - No. It's not in its crate. It came to me last night, and I said I couldn't go out, and... Where could it have gone? - I don't know. - [SIGHS] We have to find it, and we have to take the fight to Jordan. Mom wants to leave Blue Valley today. Today? Yeah. She went to the office to go get her things and told me to pack up. I gotta get her out of there. I told her not to go, but... - What should I do now? - Just... Listen to your mom. - Go home and pack. Okay? - But... - No, Courtney. - Pat... That's it. It's over. It's my fault. Losing your mother, that'll hurt forever, all right? But I can live with it as long as I know you're both safe. Pat... [MIKE] Hey. Can you tell me what's really going on? I'm sorry, Mike. I... I can't tell you. You really never wanted me and my dad around, did you? That's not true. Brothers and sisters trust each other. They tell each other everything. They help each other. I know they do, but... But you're not my sister. I get it. Have a good life, Court. Mike, no! Mike! It's all right. [SIGHS DEEPLY] Okay. [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [HENRY] Courtney! Henry? I have so much to say, and I don't know where to start. We killed them. Including Merry's brother, Starman. Damn you, Jordan. Merry is dead. [SCREAMS] Look... I'm sorry! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Stay away from me! Look! I don't know what that was. I could see everything you were thinking. Your dad's awake? Wait! [STUTTERS] And your mom was... Starman's sister? Yeah. You're my cousin? We're family. [EXCLAIMS] [CRYING HAPPILY] Uh, we... We can sort this out later, right? Yeah. Jordan has your staff. And my dad. Henry, your dad knows who I am. He said he was going to kill my mom. He can't remember anything from the last ten years. What? He doesn't remember anything since the day my mother died. I think it hurts him too much. That's good. I mean... sad. But right now, good. I need to get my staff back. And I need to save my dad. He's different. I think my mom was starting to change him. I saw it. I felt it. I bet that's why Jordan killed her. He killed your mom and my dad. We are going to need help, too. Come on. [TAPPING ON DESK] [SIGHS] [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Way to go, Court. You've just given away our identities to the enemy. Henry's not the enemy. Yes, he is. Look, if it helps, she didn't tell me anything. I read her mind. Which he's not going to do anymore. That's only polite. Listen... my mom wants me and her to leave town today. Forever. No. You can't go. [COURTNEY] I know. But if we find the staff and are able to stop the ISA, maybe we can not only save the town, but we can also save Pat and my mom. And save this asshole's dad? Courtney. If Brainwave gets his memories back, he'll kill you first, but then we're next. He'll figure out all of our identities, unless Junior here gives us up first. I'm not telling anybody anything. We all know if we find Brainwave, we should break him in two while we can. You're not gonna hurt my dad. Yeah? Try and stop me. Rick. How 'bout you try... right now? Sit down. Stand up. [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [STUDENTS GASP] [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] No worries. Just ignore us like you usually do. I told you to stay away, to not touch my friends. You know what I'll do to you. Hey! Save it for the bad guys. Henry is the bad guy, Court. No way I'm working with him. What about Pat? What's Pat think of all this? [COURTNEY] 
 
 I think he's with my mom. She was so mad. We need to do this, everyone. For Court. The only reason I'm agreeing to do this is because I know you'll do it anyway, and you need someone to watch your back. You chose Henry over me, after all he did. We're not friends anymore. [BOTH] You can't be here. This is literally the most dangerous place in town. Hey! You said you were leaving Blue Valley. Why are you bothering with this? Because Jordan, and then Sam, and then Starman. And I don't know what to think right now. This isn't a mystery that you need to solve, okay? Just get Courtney and go far away. All right? [KNOCK ON DOOR] Oh. Hi, Pat. - Hello, Barbara. - [BARBARA] Hi. Don't you look lovely today. Thank you, Sofus. Uh, it's nice to see you here, Pat. - Good to see you, too. - [CELL PHONE RINGING] [COURTNEY SIGHS] Pat's still not answering. [BETH] Should we wait for him? [COURTNEY] We can't. I just hope him and my mom are okay. So... who wants to go first? Sorry, I've already been down here before. Scary. Come on. - [STATIC CRACKLES] - [CHUCK SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Chuck? My goggles kind of still work. I mean, I can see, but Chuck keeps cutting out. So no info from Chuck and no Cosmic Staff. Great. [BETH BREATHING SHAKILY] What now? We split up, I guess. You always say stick together. We don't have a choice right now. Yolanda, Rick, and Beth, go one way. Henry and I will go the other. Oh, I'm not leaving you alone with him. No. I'm coming with you. Fine. Us three will go this way, Rick and Beth go that way. We do some recon and meet back here in    minutes. Got it. It's to thank you. For dinner. That is so thoughtful. [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN] [LILY SPEAKING NORWEGIAN] Okay. We have some family business to take care of, but it's good seeing you both. - Have a nice day. - Tell those children hello. - [BARBARA] We will. - Okay, bye. [PAT] Bye, Jordan. [DOOR CLOSES] What? Do you speak Norwegian? Me neither. I wish you could read my mind. Why would I want to do that? I know how much I hurt you. And I'd honestly do anything to take it back. Well, you can't. [BETH] This place goes on forever. It's gotta lead somewhere. [LOUD ROARING] [BETH WHISPERS] What was that? Let's see. Rick! [LOUD BREATHING] [GROWLING] [LOUD GROWL] What's in there? [LOUD BANG] That's Solomon Grundy. [SOLOMON GROWLING] That's the thing that killed my parents. [SOLOMON GROWLING] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] My dad's close. I can feel it. [CINDY] Daddy! Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, she's here! That bitch is here! [BANGING ON DOOR] Let me out! Come on! I wanna kill her, please? Please, let me! Please! Now! [DR. ITO] Go. [WILDCAT GRUNTS] [HENRY GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [STARGIRL YELPS] [INHALES DEEPLY] What are you doing? I'm going to rip this door off and kill that thing. Thought it was obvious. No, Rick! That's not why we're here. Yeah. Change of plans. [GRUNTING] Dad! Henry? [BANGING ON DOOR] [CINDY] Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Wait! Wait! Wait! [STUTTERS] I wanna kill her! Please, please, please, let me! No, no, no, Daddy! [DR. ITO] Stargirl. Daddy, Daddy, no! Snap... dragon. Dragon King. [GRUNTS] [STARGIRL GROANS] Come on, come on! [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] [DR. ITO GROWLING] [SNARLING] [BOTH SCREAMING] [COSMIC STAFF WARBLES] It's going to be okay. Come on. No, Henry. [HENRY SHUDDERS] They already got to you. They changed you back. Changed me back? This is who I am. Who I've always been. It's who you are, too. No! - [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] - [HENRY GRUNTS] It's too late. Let's go. [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] - [RICK GRUNTING] - [SOLOMON ROARING] [BETH] Please, Rick! We have to go. This isn't why we're down here! - Stop! - [RUMBLING] The others are counting on us! [GRUNTING] [HEAVY BANGING] Rick, who are they? Who are they? [YELLS] We should go. We should go! I'll be back. [ROARING] [ALL SCREAM] [BETH] We've got company. Us too. Come on! [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] I can't believe you recorded them. I wanted answers I could trust. I realized I had to find them myself. I just meant you thinking to tape the Mahkents, that was a great idea. I wouldn't have thought of that. It was good thinking. [CELL PHONE BEEPS] [AUTOMATED VOICE] I like her. You can see how Jordan looks at her. It won't matter soon. Once the machine is turned on, - everything will change. - [CELL PHONE BEEPS] What machine? What are they planning? - Pat? - I don't know. Barbara? [BEEPS] [RICK] I got this. [GRUNTING] Here, Beth! Go! Come on! [WILDCAT] Courtney, come on! [BRAINWAVE] Settle down, children. You can't hide from me. [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] How about an assist? [BOTH GRUNTING] Move it. Courtney, come on! Let's go! You first. [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] Chuck! Can you hear me? [BRAINWAVE] You're misdirected, but you're strong, Henry. That's good. [CRIES OUT] [WILDCAT] Stand back! [RUMBLING] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [YELLS] Dad... listen to me... I know what these powers did to you. How they warped what you believed in. But people aren't monsters. I don't want to fight you. I love you. [BRAINWAVE] And I love you. Let me train you. The power, Henry, you have no idea... No. You're better than this. Mom knew you could be good. She believed in you! [TEARFULLY] I know you loved her. And I know Jordan killed her because she saw the good in you, too. [BRAINWAVE] Junior. Jordan didn't kill your mother. I did. You? [BRAINWAVE] I had to make a choice. Don't make me choose again, son. Stand by my side now. Or not at all. I will never stand by your side. [YELLING] Good-bye, son. [STARGIRL] Henry! No! [RUMBLING] Chuck, come on. Come in. [RICK] Henry, get up! I am sorry. You're right. People are good. Don't let this change your mind.
