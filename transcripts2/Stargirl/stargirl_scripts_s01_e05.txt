 [REX] 
 Wendi, we gotta go now, come on. 
 [WENDI SOBBING] 
 Where are we going, Mom? 
 - Come here. 
 - [CAR DOOR CLOSES] 
 Your Dad and I are going away for a little while. 
 Your Uncle Matt is gonna stay with you, okay? 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay? 
 You be good while we're gone, Champ. 
 Okay? 
 - Here. 
 - [WENDI] 
 Come here. 
 Here. 
 I had a car just like this once. 
 It was a '   Mustang. 
 It was the love of my life. 
 Until I met your mother. 
 Listen, buddy, take care of this car until we get back. 
 It's special. 
 Just like you. 
 [WENDI] 
 Matt. 
 Thank you so much for coming. 
 Well, I could barely find Blue Valley on a map. 
 What the hell are you doing way out here? 
 Hey, what did you get my sister into this time, huh? 
 It wouldn't be safe if you knew. 
 There's paperwork inside, Matt. 
 We left this property in you name. 
 All right? 
 And Rick... 
 It says Rick is your son. 
 His name will be Rick Harris. 
 Not Rick Tyler. 
 How did I come from staying one night to now I'm raising your kid? 
 Matt, please. 
 You are the only person we can trust. 
 [REX] 
 There's a suitcase under the bed, $  ,    inside. 
 - Fifty thousand dollars? 
 - [WENDI] 
 Please do this for us. 
 We'll be back soon. 
 [SOBBING] 
 - Matt. 
 - I don't know how to take care of a kid. 
 [WENDI] 
 Just do the best you can. 
 Promise me, Matt. 
 We gotta go. 
 [CAR DOOR OPENS] 
 I wanna come with you. 
 Okay. 
 You listen to your Uncle Matt. 
 Okay? 
 Can you do that? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Okay. 
 We love you very, very much. 
 We'll be back as soon as we can, Champ. 
 Okay? 
 Come here. 
 Come here. 
 Ooh. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 [WHISPERS] 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 You be good. 
 Okay.

 Dad.

 - No, Dad. 
 Don't leave me! 
 Don't leave me. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] 
 - I'm scared, Rex. 
 - They don't know about Rick. 
 He'll be fine. 
 It's all that matters.

[SIGHS] Hmm. [BUDDY PANTING] Ugh. No. [WHINES] - [BARBARA] Courtney? - [COURTNEY GROANS] Honey, it's seven o'clock and you're not dressed. - You're gonna be late. - Ugh. Look at this mess. Court, you've got a hamper for a reason. Uh, I... I got it. [CHUCKLES] You already have so much to worry about, I got it. Thank you. [BARBARA] This new job has been      - way more worse than I thought it would be. - [PHONE CHIMES] Oh, shoot. They moved up my meeting, I gotta go. Happy Halloween. Have a good day. - [BUDDY PANTING] - Get out. Go, demon dog. Go. [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] [PAT] Hey, you got something to tell me? Let me guess, you're running away. No, moving out. Planning on riding the rails, right? It's a gym bag, Pat. I have gym today. Uh-huh, okay. - What's that? - Yeah, newspaper. - And? - [PAT SIGHS] I think Joey's dad was a member of the Injustice society. William Zarick. We called him the Wizard. Of course you did. I think maybe he and his wife were killed by the ISA. Why would a villain kill another villain? Well, I mean, they're not exactly the most stable people to begin with and I'm starting to think you might be right. They could all be in Blue Valley. I just don't know why, or who they could be. Did any of them play the violin? Yeah, the Fiddler. Brace yourself, Pat. I think Principal Bowin is the Fiddler. [CHUCKLES] Yeah? First off, the Fiddler was a man. Second, he was Irish. Okay, well, I saw her playing the violin in like... - a super evil-looking way. - Where? At the hospital. - In Brainwave's room. - What? What were you doing there? I thought some of Brainwave's visitors could be ISA members and sure enough, Principal Bowin was in his room, playing the violin. - Why would she do that? - Court, I told you      - specifically to stay away... - Okay, well, let's... - from the hospital. - Let's team back up. Or I can keep doing     - your work for you. - No. You are to do nothing. [BELL RINGING] - [BOTH GRUNTING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Why did you bring all this stuff to school? My mom was going through my closet. [GRUNTING] I think the Green Lantern is stuck. [GRUNTS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] We have to ramp up our search, Yolanda. We can't take on the entire Injustice Society ourselves. - Who can we ask? - [GIRL] Hey, Jared. Come on, let's go. What about Artemis Crock? She's the best athlete in the whole school. I thought about her, but she's too... [ARTEMIS GROWLS] - ... competitive. - Yeah. Oh, man. You should've seen the look on your face. I was awesome. We need someone with skills and heroic traits. [YOLANDA] Okay, question. If the ISA is a bunch of murdering freaks, shouldn't we be looking beyond Blue Valley High? We can't trust adults. Anyone in Blue Valley could be a member of the Injustice Society. Whoa. Careful. There are dragons in the water. [CHUCKLES] [MAN  ] He walks up the steps, it'll probably be him. [MAN  ] What do you suppose they call him for short? [MAN  ] Well, his first name's Christopher. Probably Chris. - [MAN  ] Hey, Chris. - They're hauling it tomorrow night. [SHARPE] The all five, six broadcasting dish. Ooh. The truck is taking Route   , departs at  :  . [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Very good. What about my payment? Yes, of course. Well deserved, my boy. I hope this helps with those pesky alimony payments. Oh... And a tip. It's chocolate. Imported. From France. [CHUCKLES] Oh. [EXHALES] - [PAT] Dang it. - [CAR SPUTTERING] [COURTNEY] What happened? I don't know. I thought you were a professional mechanic. - [CAR SPUTTERING] - Have you ever even fixed a car? I'm gonna need you to start the car when I say "when", okay? Okay. Okay, give it a try, Court. I thought you were going to say "when". When. [CAR SPUTTERING] [RICK] Sounds like the alternator. Yeah, that's right. You know cars or at least you got a good ear for 'em. I work on cars. - Oh. - Well, a car. What do you got going? '   Mustang. Just need a carburetor, I'll get it up and running. '   Mustang, that's a great ride. - My dad had one. - Really? You don't seem them around that often. What color? Yellow. Huh. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUFFLED RINGING] [PAT] Yeah, that's the problem right there. Thank you. Yeah, that's what I was trying to loosen right there, 'cause I think it was clogging that up. [HOURGLASS BUZZING] [PAT] Right there. [RICK GRUNTS] Okay. I think that's it. Pat Dugan, by the way. I'm Rick Harris. Mind giving me a hand, Rick? I'm gonna try and push it down the street. Sorry. [HOURGLASS BUZZING] What do you know about that kid? - Him? - Yeah. Nothing. Why? No reason. Well, uh, I guess I'll just walk. Good luck. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] _     Why are you following me? I need to talk to you. Wait. I just need to show you something, okay? It's hard to explain, but... Look at this. It's an hourglass. So what? It was going crazy before. - Something's wrong. - Yeah, something's wrong. - Yeah. - You should stay on your meds. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hmm, a bit early for trick-or-treaters. Hello. What are you supposed to be? I'm a friend of Courtney's. - A friend? - Beth Chapel. - Oh. - Ooh. KitKats. - [DOOR CLOSES] - [BETH] Normally, at this time, I'd be planning a fun evening activity to enjoy with my parents. My parents and I love all the same things. But our first hobby was ants. - Ants? - Yeah. Before my parents got so busy with work we had this huge ant farm which was a replica of Manhattan. I voted for Paris,     but Dad said our ants wouldn't understand French. Isn't that the funniest thing? - Yeah. - [BETH] He's the comedian of the family. [CHUCKLES] Ants, they're like a total and complete mini society, working for the greater good. Oh, we used to have a roach farm too. - But then all of those got... - Oh, wow, would you look at the time. I have to get ready for this trick-or-treaters. Would you mind waiting in the living room? - Sure. - [BARBARA] Thank you. Mrs. Whitmore Is the dog supposed to be chewing on that? Come here, doggy. Good doggy. So this is the room of a superhero. Hm. [MASK BUZZING] - [GOGGLES WHIRRING] - [BETH] Oh. - [GOGGLES BEEPING] - [DR. MCNIDER] Good afternoon. Ah! [DR. MCNIDER] Do you require assistance? What? [DR. MCNIDER] To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking? I'm Beth Chapel. Who are you? [DR. MCNIDER] Beth Chapel. Born May   th,      at Omaha General Hospital to Dr. Bridget Chapel, currently a thoracic surgeon at the Blue Valley Medical Center,      and James Michael Chapel, a salesman for The American Dream. Beth Chapel has a  . weighted GPA, four point zero, unweighted. [CHUCKLES] True. [DR. MCNIDER] She's the founder and only member of the Blue Valley High student  teachers appreciation club. How do you know everything? [DR. MCNIDER] I don't know everything. But I can provide information on a vast library of subjects which I have access to via the Justice Society databanks. Who are you? You are hearing the voice of Dr. Charles McNider. [BETH] Uh, okay. Why are you talking about yourself in the third person? [DR. MCNIDER] I am merely an A. I. of Dr. Charles McNider. But I can change my settings to speak in the first person if you'd like. Don't change a thing. You do you, Chuck. Oh, do you mind if I call you Chuck? Sharp objects coming through. [CHUCKLES] Say hello to the family. You are a disturbed little man. I appreciate it. Uh, I think your friend's upstairs. [BETH LAUGHING] What are you doing in my room? [GASPS] Oh, Chuck, tell me about her. [DR. MCNIDER] Courtney Elizabeth Whitmore. Permanent record includes the following infractions, talking back to teachers... These things are like Wikipedia on rocket fuel. I wonder what else it could do. - [DR. MCNIDER] What else can I do? - Take those off. [GASPS] [DR. MCNIDER] I am able to shift into various spectrums, including, X-ray, infrared and night vision. - This is so bonkers. - The goggles are just something my stepdad is working on. False. These were invented by Dr. Charles McNider     after he lost his sight fighting the mob. They helped a blind man see. He put on a mask and became Dr. Mid-Nite. Later joining the Justice Society of America. Give me those, right now. And I know that you're a superhero too. What? I saw you last night at the hospital. Flying! That's crazy... and that wasn't me. And you shouldn't even be in my room right now, I don't even know you. Um... Well... A, we eat lunch together every day, and B, last night at the hospital I heard you call Yolanda by her real name. [DR. MCNIDER] That is a common rookie superhero mistake. Chuck says it's a common rookie superhero mistake. It got someone named the Red Bee killed. Beth, let's sit down. Look, this is all top secret. You can't tell anybody. Nobody at school, not your parents... I don't really keep secrets from my parents. Do you want them to die? Because that's how you'll get your parents killed. Secret identities are superhero    . They keep the people you love safe. Now... before I let you go, I need to know a little bit more about you... - [GOGGLES BEEPING] - [BETH] What were you doing in West Farms? - [COURTNEY] What? - The dirt on your shoes... they have... farm fertilizer in them. Ew! Don't change the subject. [BETH] Rick Harris is the only kid I know who lives way out in West Farms. I mean... that's what he calls himself. What do you mean? [BETH] Rick Harris's real name is Rick Tyler. And Rick's dad's real name is Rex Tyler. What? Rex Tyler? He was a superhero. Rick's dad was a superhero? Rick's dad was Hourman. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [PAT] Oh. Hi, sorry. This is the Harris residence, right? [DOOR CLOSES] [MATT] Who are you? My name's Pat Dugan. Is Rick home? [SIGHS] What'd he do now? [PAT] Oh. Uh... He did nothing. Yeah, nothing my ass. I got someone up here every other week 'cause of Rick, all right. So, uh... I'm sorry, you're his, uh... Dad. His dad. Right. Okay. So anyhow the Mustang... [MATT] What about it? [PAT] It's a '  , right? It's a helluva a car. I bet you're both excited about fixing it up. Why would I care about that piece of junk? [PAT] It's a carburetor. Rick had mentioned he needed one, I had one lying around. Figured I'd drop it off and... Yeah. I'll give it to him. Okay. Sorry to disturb you. Take it easy. [BIRDS CHIRPING] - [WHOOPS] - Oh, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Let's get it. [BRIAN] Come on. I get paid first. How much? One hundred. Each. No way, bro. These go for fifty a piece... Inflation, bro. It's three hundred. Maybe I just take 'em off your hands and free them. Or maybe I break your arms. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. Chill out, dude. [BRIAN] Argh, it's heavy. [TRAVIS] Yeah. Dude that kid is crazy. [BRIAN] He definitely would've broken your arm. [TRAVIS] Yeah, probably. ♪ People are strange ♪ -  ♪ Is when you're a stranger ♪ - [LAUGHING] ♪ Faces look ugly when you're alone ♪ I can't believe how much Mr. Keegan owes on his house. When you called and said you'd found a new recruit I wasn't exactly expecting Beth Chapel. Why did you chose her to be the new Captain Midnight? Dr. Mid-Nite. 
 
 I didn't choose her. She just found the goggles and got them working. And she hasn't stopped talking ever since. Oh, it's well known that talking is Beth Chapel's super-power. It's true. Okay. So you wanna find Rick... Chuck tracked his phone... from his house to a liquor store on Highway to Cindy Burman's house. There are people at this location. . % are minors. One adult. Number of underage drinking infractions: eighty. Okay, narc. I'm going home. This is a bad idea. Don't go, Yolanda. This is a huge deal. Rick's like me. His dad was a member of the JSA. He's a legacy! This is beyond exciting! Okay. Well, I'm not going in there. I'll go find Rick. I'll help. [GIGGLES] [COURTNEY] Okay. Great!

[CINDY SCOFFS] - Hey. - Hi. [CINDY] You haven't said anything about my costume. Looks just like Jenny's. [BUZZING] What? It's loud in here. [CINDY] Yeah. It's supposed to be loud. What's your problem lately? You've been kind of a drag. My problem is that my dad is in the hospital, Cindy. Maybe you should go visit him then. Hospitals are quiet. Oh, my God, you're so sensitive. Henry, wait... [GIRL  ] Whoo! [YOLANDA] Jerk. [BUZZING] What'd you say? I didn't say anything. Whatever. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [COURTNEY] I know your real name is Rick Tyler. What? Your dad's name was Rex Tyler. He was Hourman. What the hell are you talking about? Let me find the others. [RICK] The others? So, you think you're all superheroes, huh? So you're Stargirl. - You're... - Wildcat. - And she's... - Just borrowing those for the night. [RICK] Right. So, what can this "magic" hourglass do? It's science. Your dad invented it. [BETH] The hourglass gave your dad super strength. For one hour a day. One hour? So the other hours he was what, just some dude? He was a brilliant chemist! [SCOFFS] Y'know that hourglass only worked for your dad. It was tied to his DNA. How do you turn it on? [BETH] How do you use any hourglass? You turn it over. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [RICK] So super strength, huh? [BETH] Yeah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [COURTNEY] Ah... [CHUCKLES] [COURTNEY] Hey, you... You really shouldn't test out your powers in public. - Our identities... - Protecting them is Superhero    . And you need a costume. Technically, we all do. Since it's Halloween. I'm not wearing a stupid costume. You guys, do whatever you want. I'm doing my own thing. - Hey! You can't just take the hourglass like... - Yes, I can! It was my dad's, right? Now it's mine. Later. - [COURTNEY SIGHS] - [YOLANDA] Congrats. You just made the biggest delinquent in school an unstoppable beast. I'm not giving up, yet. We can still get through to him. [YOLANDA] Seems like he's done listening. And how do we make him? We can't when we're dressed like this. Oh. Let's go suit up! Thanks, Beth, but we'll take it from here. Okay? Things could get really dangerous. [MUSIC PLAYING DISTANTLY] [MATT] Hey, Taylor. You are so pretty. [WOMAN] Matt, cut it out. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - ... just come sit down... - No, stop. No. Really, I mean it. [MATT LAUGHS] All right. Okay, you take that pad and I'm gonna give you my number. - Hey, come here, come here, where are you going? - Oh, my God. Matt. [MATT] Ugh! Okay. I see you still looking at me. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GLASS SHATTERS] [GRUNTS] [DR. MCNIDER] You've been stationary for quite some time. Do you need directions home? No, Chuck. I'd go home, but no one's there. - [KID LAUGHING] - Mom's working a double shift. Dad's out of town on a business trip. They don't have much time for me anymore. Now that I'm older... [PARROTING] "They want to get back to their lives!" But still... You know, I get why Rick's so mad all the time. Losing his parents like that... I can't imagine what I'd do if mine were in some kind of accident. [DR. MCNIDER] Accident? - [MACHINE BEEPS] - What? Oh, my God. [STARGIRL] Rick? We just want to talk. [RICK] Look, I'm not playing fairy princess tea time with you two. I understand. What do you understand? My parents hit a tree and they died. What grand plan of God's was that? It wasn't God's plan, Rick. - It was an accident. - Then who do I blame, huh? Do you know what it's like to be so filled up with anger that you feel like you're poisoning yourself? Do you? I want to hit something, anything, all of the time. Every second. You think I like that? I hate feeling this way. My dad was a member of the Justice Society too. He was Starman. And... even though I only met him a few times, I feel cheated. He was killed before I even got to know him. [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] But now I get to keep his legacy alive. And you can too. [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] You can be a hero like your dad. Hourman. It's your choice. My choice? [GRUNTS] [TREE CREAKING] When have I ever had a choice? Be a hero like my dad? My dad's dead. Hey, Court, come on, let's go. - No. - [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] I can't let you keep that hourglass. - Not when you're like this. - Yeah? - Try and take it. - [BETH] Rick, wait! It wasn't an accident. What? Your parents were murdered. They crashed right here. - They hit this tree and... - No. [DR. MCNIDER] The police report said a faulty tire that had been recalled blew out and caused the crash. But the recalled tires were never made for the make and model of the vehicle they were driving. Dr. McNider says it wasn't the tree that killed them. He says he can... show us? [GASPS] [BETH] They were here. [CAR APPROACHING] But so was someone else. [GROWLS] [BETH] Or something. Chuck calls it Solomon Grundy. [GROWLS] [CAR SQUEALS] [WENDI SCREAMING] [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] [COURTNEY] Beth? Are you okay? Yeah. [BETH] It's just so scary. [BETH BREATHES SHAKILY] [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] [COURTNEY] Your parents... I'm betting they were killed by the same people that killed my dad. Who? [COURTNEY] I don't know yet. But whoever they are, they're in Blue Valley. They're the reason, I'm putting together this new team. To get justice. For my dad. For yours. For all of the JSA. I'll do it. [RICK] But I don't want justice, Courtney. I want revenge. [COSMIC STAFF WARBLING] [SONG PLAYING OVER RADIO] [TIRES SCREECH] [WOMAN PLAYING VIOLIN] What the hell? [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] [BARBARA] Pat? You down there? Yeah? There's been some kind of accident. [MAN] Yeah, I was in the middle of supper when I got the call. Sitting over there on main street in front of the theater. You know something, Dugan? Looks like King Kong punched this thing. Yeah. Something. [BUZZING] [VIOLIN CONTINUES PLAYING] [WHOOSHING] Gary? Where are you going? [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [GRUNTS] [MUSIC RESONATING] [GRUNTING] Seems like you got a stronger will than your friend. It's too bad. For you. [GUN COCKS AND FIRES] [PAT] Courtney?
