  Audible! 
  Come on. 
  You got this! 
   Ready? 
  Set. 
  Hut! 
   Hut! 
  Hut! 
   [PLAYERS GRUNTING] 
   [PLAYER GROANS] 
   - [CROWD GROANS] 
  - [BOTH] 
  Whoa! 
   What the. 
   - [BRIAN LAUGHS] 
  Brian! 
  What the hell? 
   - What? 
  - That was a late hit  and you know it. 
   Hmm. 
  It seemed like you went down pretty easy. 
   Maybe you shouldn't be on this team. 
   Why? 
  'Cause I'm a girl? 
   [CHUCKLES] 
  Nah. 
   I just don't think you're that good. 
   - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
   Next time you try that, you'll be on the ground. 
   Me? 
  On the ground? 
  [LAUGHS] 
   Sure. 
   Hey. 
   - [GRUNTS] 
  - [CROWD GASPS] 
   - [LAWRENCE] 
  Yeah! 
  - [COACH HANK WHISTLES] 
   Nice hit, sweetie. 
   - [COACH HANK WHISTLES] 
  - Did you see that? 
   - [PAULA CHUCKLES] 
  - Crock! 
   Oh, come on. 
   - [GIRL] 
  Oh, yeah, girl! 
  - [BOY] 
  Crock, nice. 
   - That was a late hit, Coach. 
  - [COACH HANK] 
  Yours was later. 
   I'm carrying this team and you know it. 
   - Bench. 
  - Ugh! 
   - [WHISTLES] 
  Rickets. 
  - [RICKETS] 
  You got it, Coach! 
   All right, come on, guys, let's do this! 
   [COACH HANK] 
  All right, boys. 
  Let's go. 
  Line it up. 
   We're on again. 
   [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON FIELD] 
   [CAR LOCK BEEPS] 
   [METALLIC DRAGGING] 
   Mr. 
  Crock, Mrs. Brooks. 
   Hey  I want to see Artemis on that field  just as much as you do. 
   No, but this was practice  and she, um, hit one of her own teammates. 
   That kid's gotta learn to control her temper. 
   Yeah. 
  She gets it from her mother. 
   She's a real firecracker. 
   [CHUCKLES] 
  True. 
  I do have my moments, hon. 
   I know I may be new here,  but I've seen parents like you my whole career,  so don't think you can intimidate me. 
   Whether Artemis plays or sits is my call. 
  Hell  I'll bench her for the whole damn season  if I need to. 
   Homecoming's around the corner. 
   And our daughter is your best player. 
   You're not gonna do anything to her. 
   [LAWRENCE] 
  Yeah, Coach. 
   Let's see how you like  - being taken out of the game. 
  - [COACH HANK] 
  Wait... 
   [GASPS] 
   What are you doing in my bedroom? 
   - Where did all that come from? 
  - This isn't a joke, Courtney. 
   That lantern can kill you. 
   What's it do? 
   Well, thankfully, nothing without its ring. 
   What were you thinking, stealing all of this? 
   I wasn't stealing it, I was  - borrowing it. 
  - You stole it. 
   Okay, yeah, maybe I stole it,  but I had to do something if you weren't going to. 
   I thought we were in this together, Courtney. 
   I really did. 
   Pat  we are in this together, but  we need help if we're going to stop the Injustice Society. 
   We need to form a new JSA. 
   And you have obviously already started. 
   Um  I've started  starting. 
   [PAT] 
  I see Hourman's costume but no hourglass. 
   You gave it to Rick Harris, didn't you? 
   How did you know that? 
   'Cause I've got a truck in my garage  with his fist prints all over it. 
   So you know Rick Harris is really Rick Tyler, right? 
   I had my suspicions. 
   What do you mean you had your suspicions? 
   I thought Hourman was your friend. 
   He... 
  He gave you all that stuff in the basement. 
   I never knew Rex had a son. 
  If I'd have known that he... 
   Did you know him and his wife  weren't killed in a car accident? 
   They were murdered  by Solomon Grundy. 
   How do you know that? 
   Dr. 
  Mid-Nite told me. 
   Dr. 
  Mid-Nite? 
   Well, his goggles did. 
   Beth was wearing them. 
   Wait. 
  Who's Beth? 
   The new Dr. 
  Mid-Nite. 
   Who else did you recruit, Courtney? 
   - Yolanda Montez. 
  - [SIGHS] 
   She's class president. 
  Or she was... 
   And Yolanda is now... 
   Wildcat. 
   Okay, this is serious. 
   You've put these kids in real danger. 
   You need to get everything you took back. 
   I can't just take the hourglass from Rick. 
   It belonged to his dad. 
   I'll talk to Rick. 
   You get Dr. 
  Mid-Nite's goggles and Wildcat's costume  and you bring them back here, do you understand that? 
   - Pat, I can't just take... 
  - Or do you want your new friends  to wind up like Joey Zarick? 
   Do you? 
   I know you don't respect me much, Courtney,  but I thought it was more than this. 
   [HEART MONITOR BEEPING] 
   [FLATLINING] 
   [CELL PHONE VIBRATES] 
   [SIGHS] 
   - Dad? 
  - Hey, Cameron. 
   It's early. 
  Is everything okay? 
   Yeah. 
  Yeah, everything's fine. 
   I know today's a hard day. 
   Go back to sleep, son. 
   Ah, I'm gonna feel that in the morning. 
   Maybe next time, you'll remember to lift with your legs. 
   Yeah, maybe next time they can hire a skinnier coach. 
   Or maybe you should stop killing them. 
   What is this, like, the third coach  in two seasons? 
   Hey, the jerk had it coming, okay? 
   Besides, way I hear it, the last coach, he left town. 
   [CHUCKLES] 
  And the one before that. 
   Accident with a riding mower. 
   It was tragic. 
   Don't push me. 
   Not today. 
   Anaya's getting a bit tired of having to replace her coaches. 
   Only looking out for our daughter. 
   A newer, safer America is the greatest gift  you could give her, and I need you two focused. 
   Focused on what, huh? 
   We've been on pause waiting for you. 
   We're ready to get back in the game anytime. 
   I can't take much more of this town  with its rotary clubs and bake sales. 
   Finish cleaning this up. 
   And get your suits out of storage. 
   You're both going back into action tonight. 
   Well, all right then, bud. 
  All right. 
   [CHUCKLES] 
   Game on. 
   Whoa. 
  Tell... 
  Tell me this isn't breakfast. 
   Nah, it's for the science fair today. 
   Well, what are you studying, Pop-Tarts? 
   No. 
  Actually,  used the leftover Halloween candy  to make a chocolate volcano. 
   It's gotta be up and running by third period. 
   How long have you known about this? 
   [MIKE] 
  Three weeks, give or take,  but I do my best work under pressure. 
  Trust me. 
   [BARBARA GASPS] 
   Cool volcano. 
   - The science fair today? 
  - Yeah. 
   See, Dad? 
  At least she's dialed in. 
   What time does it start? 
   Uh, afternoon. 
  2:00, I think. 
   Darn it. 
  I have a meeting then. 
   You know what? 
  Maybe I can change it. 
  Can you go? 
   [MIKE] 
  No. 
  No, no, no. 
   Please, nobody come. 
   No one's parents are gonna be there  and I don't want to look like some nerd. 
   Too late. 
   For the lava. 
   [CHUCKLES] 
   [PAT SIGHS] 
   Hey, Rick. 
   Your car break down again? 
   I knew your dad, Rick. 
   Your real one. 
   Can we talk? 
   [COMMENTATOR ON PHONE] 
  Uh-oh, folks. 
  He's in trouble. 
   [YOLANDA] 
  Okay, now watch this part. 
   [COMMENTATOR ON PHONE] 
  Incredible! 
  What a comeback... 
   [YOLANDA] 
  Isn't he incredible? 
   Did you know right before the Castillo fight  they stripped Ted Grant's title from him? 
   They accused him of fixing a fight,  which he totally didn't do. 
   But by the time they cleared his name,  his reputation was already ruined. 
   This fight was his last chance  to reinvent himself, and he did. 
   He came back a champion. 
   Wow. 
  He's so  inspiring. 
   If Ted Grant came back, then I have a chance too. 
   That's what being Wildcat really is. 
   Thank you, Courtney. 
   Thank you for picking me. 
   You're welcome. 
   I've gotta run. 
  I'll... 
  I'll text you later. 
   [VIDEO RESUMES ON PHONE] 
   [BETH] 
  Are you kidding? 
   There is nothing I love more than  to search through a library for that one special book. 
   It's like our own secret treasure hunt. 
   Your favorite novel? 
   I've never read it before, no. 
   [CHUCKLES] 
   We should download the movie. 
   [DR. 
  MID-NITE] 
  Why don't we just burn this book  while we're at it? 
   [BETH] 
  You're a real riot, Chuck. 
   [DR. 
  MID-NITE] 
  I'll be here all week. 
   [BETH] 
  Yay! 
   You bought the first edition off the stands? 
   Wow. 
  You are old. 
   Okay, okay, not old. 
   Wise. 
   [COURTNEY] 
  Beth. 
   Oh. 
  Hey there, Stargirl. 
   Hey! 
  Watch the code-names in public. 
  [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] 
   Don't worry, no one ever pays any attention  to what I'm saying anyway... 
   Except Chuck. 
   Seriously, Court,  thanks so much for these. 
   Chuck's so cool. 
   He makes everything more fun. 
   We talk for hours. 
   I've never met anyone who listened to me  until him. 
   Um, any JSA business to talk about? 
   No. 
  Nothin'. 
  All quiet. 
   I'm just here to study for that history test. 
   Oh. 
  Good luck. 
   [LAUGHS] 
   Chuck, you are so funny. 
   [LAUGHS] 
   You are a real riot. 
   You're like my best friend. 
   It got towed here last night. 
   So? 
   So you did this, didn't you? 
   With the hourglass. 
   - Why? 
  - My uncle's a jerk. 
   Your father would never have used his power like that. 
   My father's dead,  so what's it matter what he would do? 
   The Injustice Society killed him  and my mom. 
   Yeah. 
   I just found that out. 
   Courtney said these people are still out there. 
   Why haven't you stopped them? 
   I'm trying to. 
   In fact  I thought you might be able to help me, Rick. 
   With the hourglass? 
   With this. 
   It belonged to your father. 
   - Hi. 
  - Hey. 
   Um, hi. 
   We need to talk. 
   You're giving us our first mission, aren't you? 
   I can't believe I'm actually looking forward to this. 
   [BETH] 
  It's scary, but with Chuck in my ear  I feel like I can do anything. 
   We can. 
   Wildcat proved that. 
   So what's the plan? 
   Yeah. 
  Tell us "the plan."  There is no plan. 
   - What? 
  - What? 
   I need all the JSA stuff back. 
   The costume, the goggles, everything. 
   What? 
  Why? 
   Pat found out I took it and he's so pissed. 
   You didn't tell him? 
   So what? 
  It's not up to Pat. 
   This stuff isn't his in the first place. 
   I know, but... 
   Does this mean I can't hang out with Chuck anymore? 
   Being Wildcat is the only good thing  that's happened to me in forever. 
   I'm not giving you back the suit. 
   Don't make me say goodbye to Chuck. 
   We're friends now. 
   It doesn't make sense. 
  Are you sure my dad wrote this? 
   [PAT] 
  Why? 
   He's talking about growing up in Michigan  and meeting my mom at Calvin College. 
   But my dad grew up in Connecticut,  and he met my mom when they were kids. 
   None of this is right. 
   Maybe it's all some kind of code? 
   Well, I mean, I thought  the chemical equations might be. 
   I didn't think the diary entries were. 
   That's good thinking, though. 
   I'll keep looking at it. 
   You should leave the journal with me, Rick. 
   You? 
   This was my dad's. 
  I'm keeping it. 
   You need to leave it with me. 
  The hourglass, too. 
   Why? 
   Because I don't think you're ready for it, Rick. 
   You don't know me any better than you knew my dad. 
   I know that he invented the hourglass. 
   The power inside it. 
   I also know how much he respected that power. 
   He knew how addictive that power could be,  and how tempting it was  to use it in all the wrong ways. 
   Limiting the powers was his idea. 
   One hour a day. 
  And I never saw him abuse it. 
   Not like you have. 
   You look at me like everyone else around here does. 
   Like I'm trash. 
   Like I'm not worth a damn. 
   No, Rick. 
   You're wrong. 
  That's not at all how I look at you. 
   Courtney said you were her dad's sidekick. 
   But you've had this journal for how long  and you didn't figure it out? 
   You didn't know my parents were murdered,  you didn't know about me. 
  I gotta ask you,  what the hell did Starman use you for? 
   'Cause as far as I can tell, you don't do anything. 
   What's up, Coach? 
   And this is our star player  Artemis Crock. 
   I look forward to working with you. 
   Welcome to Blue Valley, Coach Karasick. 
   [LAWRENCE] 
  You've got a great team, Coach. 
   [CHUCKLES] 
   Good afternoon. 
   You better not bet against us this season, Sharpe. 
   I wouldn't dare think of it. 
   Your daughter's gonna take Blue Valley all the way. 
   I know that. 
  Yes, sir. 
   What do you want? 
   Not me, Paula. 
   Jordan. 
   We've got the broadcasting equipment. 
   Now we need to retrieve the satellite codes to use it. 
   Everything's set for tonight, my friends. 
   We're not your friends. 
   Come on. 
   Sure you are. 
   No. 
   Stephen. 
   We pride ourselves in keeping the school clean. 
   Pick up your trash. 
   [SNICKERS] 
   What a putz. 
   [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
   [MAN] 
  All right. 
  What do we have here? 
   - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
   Hi. 
   It turned out so good. 
   - I'm so proud of her. 
  - She did such a good job. 
   Hey. 
  What'd I miss? 
   Barbara. 
  You came. 
   I'm so sorry I'm late. 
   Oh, no, no. 
  No problem at all. 
   Check this out. 
   So, there are three kinds of lava, right? 
   Uh, pillow, pahoehoe and aa. 
   Ooh. 
  And what kind is this? 
   - Chocolate. 
  - [BARBARA CHUCKLES] 
   [BARBARA GASPS] 
   [ALL GASP] 
   [BOY] 
  Whoa! 
   [BARBARA] 
  Oh, wow! 
   [LAUGHS] 
   [MIKE] 
  That's great. 
   It smells delicious. 
   [BELL RINGING] 
   [COURTNEY] 
  Beth! 
  Yolanda! 
   Guys, wait. 
   Please! 
   "Please" what, give up being Wildcat? 
   I already said no. 
   And I'm not giving up Dr. 
  Mid-Nite. 
   He's my friend, Courtney. 
   I know how important it is to you. 
   I... 
  I see that. 
   So, maybe we can just go talk to Pat? 
   [RICK] 
  I just did. 
   And I don't get him. 
   What did your dad see in him? 
  What do you? 
   There's more to Pat than you know. 
   I've got one question for you, Courtney. 
   If Pat asks for your staff back,  are you giving to him? 
   I didn't think so. 
   What's that? 
   It's my dad's journal. 
   He was a chemist, right? 
   So can your goggles tell me what this equation is? 
   Pat thought it might be some kind of code. 
   See. 
  He's smarter than you think. 
   [DR. 
  MID-NITE] 
  I'm sorry, Beth. 
   This equation has no match on record. 
   I'm unable to provide any information. 
   He doesn't know. 
   - [BETH] 
  Whoa. 
  - What... 
  What happened? 
   [DR. 
  MID-NITE] 
  My alarm system's been triggered, Beth. 
   Still using the same signature, I see. 
   Typical. 
  That man has no imagination. 
   Who? 
   [DR. 
  MID-NITE] 
  My arch-enemy. 
   His digital fingerprints are all over this. 
   Earth to Beth? 
  Hello? 
   [BETH] 
  Someone's trying to hack into the Empire Enterprises system. 
   What's Empire Enterprises? 
   A communications company. 
   So a hacker is trying  to hack into some lame phone company? 
   - So what? 
  - [BETH] 
  So,  the hacker works for  the Injustice Society of America. 
   What? 
   [BETH] 
  Chuck's main adversary. 
   He's known as The Gambler. 
   He's a master strategist. 
   A genius when it comes to probabilities. 
   A programming whiz. 
   Encrypted networks are his thing. 
   Real Dark Web stuff. 
   He's wanted for fraud, conspiracy, and murder. 
   Okay. 
  So this is our chance to go catch one of them. 
   And then what? 
   Then we interrogate them. 
  Make them  tell us everything they know. 
   Or else. 
   Or else what? 
   We should tell Pat. 
   So he can tell us no and try to take all our stuff? 
   - Forget it. 
  - [YOLANDA] 
  Yeah, I'm with him. 
   We already have four against one. 
   We don't need five. 
   Oh. 
  Five including my pal Chuck. 
   I'm going. 
  Anyone else? 
   I will. 
   - Uh, me too! 
  - [RICK] 
  Later. 
   [COURTNEY] 
  Wait! 
   It's only a hacker, Courtney. 
   That hacker could have the power to melt our faces. 
   Incorrect. 
   The Gambler doesn't have any physical powers of any kind. 
   He sounds like an easy target, Court. 
   Maybe the easiest of them all. 
   Okay. 
  I'm coming. 
   But if we are going to do this,  we need to protect our identities. 
 
 
 
   Does this mean I get a costume? 
   I'd really like a costume. 
   We won't be gone all night. 
   I mean, we'll be gone for a while. 
   We're going to... 
   Have a date night. 
   - Date night. 
  - Your father and I haven't done that in  - quite some time. 
  So... 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
   You've never done date night, Mom. 
   - Well, we're doing it tonight. 
  - Yeah. 
   [LAWRENCE] 
  And we're gonna go to the city. 
   We'll be home before midnight. 
  You do your push-ups. 
   Side crunches. 
  I would say three sets of 12. 
   Hamstring curls. 
   [LAWRENCE] 
  And so you wanna do pull-ups, you wanna do  - underhand. 
  - [PAULA] 
  Toe presses. 
   Drink your shake. 
  And remember,  Mom and Dad love you. 
   Okay. 
   - Bye, sweetie. 
  - Bye, sweetie. 
   [LAWRENCE INHALES NERVOUSLY] 
   I overheard you two talking. 
   It's somebody's birthday. 
   Which one of you gets to make a wish? 
   Don't be shy. 
   It's my mom's birthday. 
   Was. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
   Was her birthday. 
   [WAITRESS] 
  Oh. 
   Oh, I'm sorry. 
   Should I take this away or... 
   No. 
  No. 
  Um... 
   It was sweet. 
  Thank you. 
   [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
   Go ahead. 
   Make a wish. 
   For her. 
   I never thought Pop-Tarts, Skittles and hot fudge  would go together, but this is absolutely delicious. 
   I mean, you would've won first if  if the judges tried this. 
   Definitely not last. 
   [MIKE] 
  Um, taste the marshmallow villagers. 
   They taste, like, way better dead. 
   - [BARBARA] 
  Mm. 
  - Hey. 
   Hey, babe. 
   Would you like some dinner? 
   Uh, I think I'm okay. 
   Courtney home? 
   Uh-uh. 
  She's out with friends. 
   Which friends? 
   [BARBARA] 
  Beth and friends from school. 
   Okay. 
   Are you sure The Gambler's in here? 
   Who comes up with these names? 
   I like 'em. 
   Chuck says the signal's still active. 
   So, yep, he's in there. 
   [WILDCAT] 
  Wonder what he's doing. 
   Who cares? 
   Okay. 
  You guys sure about this? 
   Hell yes. 
   I'm sure. 
   Yeah. 
  Me too. 
   Let's move. 
  It's time to start getting answers. 
   Hey. 
  Follow my lead. 
   Yeah. 
  Whatever. 
   Let's get this party started, shall we?

   So what do we do now? 
   [STARGIRL] 
  Okay. 
   Let's lead them outside, and we keep them together  so we can stay together. 
   I can do this myself. 
   [HOURMAN GRUNTING] 
   - Hourman! 
  - [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Game time. 
   [WILDCAT GRUNTS] 
   [HOURMAN GRUNTS] 
   Stay down, kid. 
   [STEPHEN OVER EARPHONES] 
  I'll have the satellite access codes  in less than five minutes. 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Copy that. 
   [GROANING] 
   [HOURMAN] 
  I got Jason Voorhees. 
   [WILDCAT] 
  I got Tiger Lady. 
   Wait! 
  We need to stick together! 
   [GRUNTS] 
   [GASPS] 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  You know, I knew the last guy who wore that outfit. 
   He was a big, dumb idiot too. 
   [GRUNTS] 
   [GRUNTS] 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Ya-hoo! 
   [SPORTSMASTER LAUGHS] 
   You ready for some more, kid? 
   [GRUNTS] 
   [GRUNTS] 
   [WILDCAT GROANS] 
   [HOURMAN GRUNTS] 
   [BOTH GRUNTING] 
   Nice moves, kid. 
   [HOURMAN STRAINING] 
   Hey, Gretzky! 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Good for you, kid. 
   Bet that thing's heavy, huh? 
   [LAUGHS] 
   [STARGIRL] 
  Come on! 
   [WILDCAT GRUNTS AND GROANS] 
   I can't end this too quickly. 
   [GASPS] 
   [TIGRESS] 
  Okay. 
  Now we can. 
   [TIGRESS] 
  Come here, kitty cat! 
  [GRUNTS] 
   Chuck, what do I do? 
   [DR. 
  MID-NITE] 
  There's a fire extinguisher. 
   [DR. 
  MID-NITE] 
  Got it. 
   - [TIGRESS GROANING] 
  - [GRUNTING] 
   [BETH] 
  Run! 
  Run! 
  Run, run! 
   [WILDCAT] 
  How do we get out of here? 
   [TIGRESS] 
  Hmm. 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Two against one, kid. 
   [WILDCAT PANTING] 
   [GASPING] 
   [STEPHEN] 
  I've got the satellite codes. 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Copy that. 
   - We're going into overtime. 
  - Mission accomplished? 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Not quite, babe. 
   [PUCK TICKING] 
   [TICKING CONTINUES] 
   [STARGIRL] 
  Oh, no. 
   [JETS WHOOSHING] 
   Don't worry. 
   He's with us. 
   [SPORTSMASTER] 
  Date night's over. 
   [STRIPE] 
  Kids, let's go. 
  Now. 
   [HOURMAN] 
  There is no way he built this out of cars. 
   More like 20 cars. 
   Pat should work for NASA. 
   I guess Court was right. 
   There is more to Pat than we thought. 
   - Listen, I wanted to... 
  - I know. 
  I know. 
   Just thank God you showed up. 
   Really? 
   Oh, you would never believe them, Pat. 
   I had a plan,  to stick together and we would nab The Gambler  and interrogate him and... 
   They didn't do any of it. 
   They didn't listen to a single word I said. 
   Seriously? 
   - Serious. 
  - What, like,  it went in one ear and out the other? 
   Right out the other. 
   And it seems to me, based on what you're telling me, that  you're trying to help them. 
   I'm just trying to help them. 
   I mean, that's gotta be kind of frustrating. 
   So frustrating. 
   And even maybe a little annoying. 
   - Oh. 
  A lot annoying. 
  - Yeah. 
   They're going to get themselves killed. 
   Yeah. 
  I mean, that's my sentiment exactly. 
   I see what you did there. 
   Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
   I feel for ya. 
   I guess we got lucky tonight. 
   Well, I mean, luck will only get you so far, Court. 
   You need training. 
   Your new teammates, too. 
   Teammates? 
   So... 
   They can keep the costumes? 
   I mean, do we have a choice? 
   [STARGIRL] 
  None whatsoever. 
   - [PAT] 
  Yeah. 
  - [STARGIRL CHUCKLES] 
   [STEPHEN] 
  Wasn't a total loss, Jordan. 
   We have the satellite codes  and the equipment Dr. 
  Ito requested. 
   We have everything we need. 
   [LAWRENCE] 
  Except Brainwave. 
   Without him, Project: New America  is Project: Nothing. 
   Right, Jordan? 
  We need Brainwave. 
   You know, I thought Mozart here was gonna wake him up. 
   [PAULA] 
  Her husband could've. 
   [ANAYA] 
  None of this will matter  if the Justice Society is here. 
   [LAWRENCE] 
  They're not the real Justice Society. 
   We killed them. 
   They are dead. 
   [ANAYA] 
  So then who are they? 
   Let's find out. 
   Meeting adjourned.
