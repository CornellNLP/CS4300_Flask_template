 [BARBARA] 
 What is that? 
 [COSMIC STAFF HUMS] 
 [SCREAMS] 
 Please, just let me do the explaining, okay? 
 Dad was a superhero, and now I'm a superhero, too. 
 If this is remotely true... 
 then our whole marriage is a lie. 
 Everything we are together is real. 
 This family is real. 
 You need to go. 
 - Barbara... 
 - Get out of this house. 
 [CRUSHER] 
 
 They were kids. 
 Except maybe that big robot. Then we should bring our children into this. - They could help us find them. - No! We agreed to keep our sons and daughters in the dark. I remember who Stargirl is. Her name's Courtney Whitmore. Her stepfather is Pat Dugan. You might remember him as Stripesy. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Brainwave remembers who I am. Okay, we gotta get outta here. [BRAINWAVE] We'll take care of them. Stargirl, her sidekick... and her mother. [JORDAN] Henry. The boy, too. Mike. We can't leave a legacy running around. Of course. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BEEPING] -    [BEEPING] [BRAINWAVE] Jordan. The orders have been given. Sportsmaster and Tigress are on the hunt. Courtney Whitmore and her family will soon be dead. Dr. Ito is preparing his machine. - [DOOR OPENS] - [CINDY] Dad, what's going on? Where does that go? Dad! No, no, no, Dad! Dad, what's in there? [BRAINWAVE] When we begin our broadcast, the Gambler will trigger a communications blackout across the United States, blinding the Pentagon, routing the attack through Moscow. By the time they realize it's coming from within the US, it'll be too late. Amplified by Ito's machine, my powers will extend far beyond Blue Valley. There will be a significant cost to the process... but after I finish reprogramming their minds, they'll share our values. They'll think like us. They'll fight for us, if need be. After all... I doubt the rest of the country will accept our secession quietly. Jordan. After all this time, your dreams of a better society, of a New America is about to become reality. Your wife would be very proud. [INHALES DEEPLY] Let me know when Stargirl and her family are dead. [BEEPING] [COURTNEY] What else do we need? Uh, sleeping bags, I think. Where are they? Upstairs hall closet. I'll get them. Uh, I'll get my staff. Okay? Okay. Okay. [MIKE] So, who takes their kids out of school in November to go camping? What, are we having Thanksgiving up there? Don't tell me we gotta kill our own turkey. I'm not doing that. You didn't tell any of your friends about this, did you, Mike? Tell them what? I don't know anything! I'm sure Courtney knows why we're leaving. [DRILL WHIRRING] [STAMMERING] Okay, don't touch that, okay, Mike? I brought you down here 'cause I want to explain something to you, okay? And it's something that I... I really have no idea how to explain. So, I thought... - that if I just showed it to you, that... - [DRILL WHIRRING] Listen, I don't need to see some other boring old car that you'll turn into some metaphor about life. Just tell me, please. Okay, Mike. This isn't about an old car, okay? - This is about... - [DRILL WHIRRING] Hey! Put that down! And listen to me! - [DRILL THUDS] - I'm serious. Stop treating me like a little kid 'cause I'm not. Please! - Mike... - I'm sick of it. Stop. [PAT] I'm sorry, I... Mike? [METALLIC CLANGING] Hello? Oh, hey, Crusher. [CRUSHER] Hey, there... Pat. [STAMMERS] What are you doing up so late? And how'd you get in here? Is, uh... Is there something I can help you with? [CRUSHER SIGHS] You know, I gotta hand it to you, bud. You really shocked the hell right out of me. I mean, really. I never would have thought you had it in you. So, what are we talking about here? Come on, now! No more secrets between friends. It really hurts my feelings. You never telling me about your big robot. [CLICKING TONGUE] Where is it? Where you hiding it? It's in there, isn't it? Look, Crusher... I think maybe you need to relax a little, 'cause... well, I think you got it all wrong. [CHUCKLING] You know, Pat, I gotta say, as famous last words go... I'm underwhelmed. - Yeah. - [CLANGS] Okay. [GRUNTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BARBARA GASPS] [SHATTERS] [CROSSBOW THUDS] [BOTH GRUNTING] - [BARBARA GRUNTS] - [GLASS SHATTERING] Ah! [GRUNTING] Lovely home you have. [WHIMPERING] [CLANGS] [GROANING] [LAUGHS] Look at you go. All that cardio's paying off. I'll tell you what, Pat. [CLANGS] Let's do this old-school. You and me. What do you say? Yeah. I'd like that. You'd like that? I'd like it too. Come on. What do you got? What do you got, Dugan? Punching power comes from the hips, Pat! Come on, the hips! Let's see it. You wanna try again? Yeah. Yeah, I'd actually like to do that. Better. I like you, Pat. [GROANING] I'm, uh, glad it's gonna be me that does it. You all right there, big guy? - No, I'm hurt pretty bad. - Oh, no. I think you might have fractured my jaw! - [PAT GRUNTING] - Cheap shot, huh? [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [PAT GRUNTING] Did you really think you were gonna come up to Blue Valley... - [PAT GROANING] - ... and stop us? Huh? - [GRUNTS] - [GROANS] [TIGRESS GRUNTING] [CLANGS] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] Wow! Look at that. [LAUGHS] He's a beaut, bud. [GROANS] By  :   tomorrow morning, it'll all be over for everyone. [GRUNTS] I'm sorry you won't be around to see it, pal. - [DRILL WHIRS] - [GROANS LOUDLY] [PAT] Crusher. Stay away from my kid. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [BLOWS LANDING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [BARBARA] Aah! [TIGRESS SCREAMS] [BARBARA PANTING] Sorry about the door. Court, that was... I know, it was dangerous. - ... amazing. - [COSMIC STAFF HUMS] We should go. Mike, you okay? [THUDS] What the hell is that? Who's that? That's a robot I built. And, uh, that's an old friend of mine. So... You built that? - [PAT] Yep. - [CELL PHONE BEEPS] [STRIPE POWERS ON] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] That... That's so badass. Yeah, I'll explain it all on the way to the cabin. Bring the drill. [DRILL WHIRS] You sure you're okay, Dad? [PAT] Yeah, thanks. [STRIPE WHIRRING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [LILY SPEAKING NORWEGIAN: SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A SUITABLE WIFE.] [SOFUS SPEAKING NORWEGIAN: IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] [IN ENGLISH] Steven, yes. Are they... [SHARPE SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ON PHONE] I understand. [IN ENGLISH] Small complication. [LINE RINGING] [DOOR OPENS] [PRINCIPAL BOWIN] Isaac? What are you doing here so late? Isaac, sweetie? What is it? [ISAAC SNIFFLES] This guy... He keeps calling me a "tuba turd", and... [SNIFFLES] Today he tripped me down the stairs and tore my new jacket. You know, when your father was a child, he was picked on for playing his favorite instrument, too. But he never stopped pursuing his passion. He never let anyone else define him. And eventually they stopped bothering him. Why? Because he took the bow of his violin... and put it through one of their eardrums. They never bullied him again. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] - Are you okay? - Yeah. Are you? [JOEY] Hey, Court. Let's get inside. - [VEHICLE APPROACHING] - Hey, hold on. Who's that? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [JUSTIN] Hello, friends. - I bring forth a feast... - [CAR DOOR SHUTS] ... fit for kings and queens. [DOG BARKING] Oh, and loyal steeds. Oh! [RUMBLING] [BETH GASPING] Oh, my God! [RUMBLING] [STRIPE ENGINE REVVING] - Remote control. - [CAR ALARM BEEPS] [MIKE] Yeah? When are you going to teach me how to drive that thing? Never. Let's get in there. That's everyone and everything coming tonight, right? [BARBARA] I hope so. [JUSTIN SIGHS] The battle is nigh. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [CINDY] Dr. King. Is Stargirl dead? [DR. KING] You had a job, Cynthia. Watching my son for any signs of his latent abilities developing. - But I did... -  If I had known his telepathic powers were emerging, I may have been able to help him... I would have done anything to help him. Instead, I had to end him. Because of you. [CINDY] Okay, listen, Doc. You know what would have really helped Henry? Is if you weren't lying in a hospital bed wearing adult diapers while the rest of us were picking up your slack! Do you know what your father truly thinks of you, Cynthia? He sees you as a failed experiment. Nothing more. My father loves me... you liar. Why would I lie? Why are we arguing? Just let me out of here so I can help you. I could be a valuable member of the Injustice Society. Oh, we feel the same way your father does. We don't want you. [CINDY] Help! [KEYPAD BEEPING] [CINDY SCREAMING] [DR. ITO] Dr. King. Are you ready for the test? Oh, yes. - [CINDY SCREAMING] - [BANGING ON DOOR] [BEEPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Unbelievable. [DR. ITO] Isn't it? [AIR HISSING] [BEEPING] [DR. ITO] Before we begin the test, Dr. King... There is a risk. What kind of risk? [DR. ITO] This is either going to work, or... every cell... in your pre-frontal cortex... is going to melt. And your spinal cord... [SIZZLES] ... will turn into slush. [SIZZLES] Understood. Continue. [DR. ITO] Mmm. [BEEPING] [MACHINE WHIRRING] [GROANS] [CRACKLING] [BEEPING RAPIDLY] [OVERLAPPING VOICES] [GROANING] [BEEPING RAPIDLY] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [DR. ITO] Dr. King? [PANTING] I heard their voices. Millions of them. Their wretched thoughts... and their ugly truths. [BREATHING HEAVILY] It's going to work. [DR. ITO] Hmm. Wonderful. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Was Pat right? [DR. MCNIDER] I'm still searching, Beth, but Pat's hunch was correct. There has been a massive increase     in electrical activity  in Blue Valley. I'm narrowing it down to where. My concern is that it's connected to Brainwave somehow. I believe his powers increased after the death of Henry. [BETH] What do you mean? [DR. MCNIDER] There was an energy release when Henry died. That energy was absorbed by Brainwave. I am sorry, Beth. I know this tragedy has affected you all. Yolanda. Are you okay? Are you thinking about Henry? No. Because there's nothing I can do about it. [BEEPING] Are you reading, m'lad? It's my dad's journal. [JUSTIN] Oh. [JOEY SNIFFLES] He was investigating the Injustice Society... long before you were. They killed him. And my mom. They sent Solomon Grundy after them. And I think... that that's because my dad found out exactly what they were doing in Blue Valley. [STAMMERS] And I'm betting that that secret is in here. But... it's all written in some kind of code. [STAMMERS] I do love a good puzzle. [JOEY CHUCKLES] Yeah. Uh... The... The equation... on the last page is the key. But... But I'm missing a number, you see that? That's all I need. I... I've tried my mom's birthday, my dad's, mine. I... I don't know what else it could be. Well... All good things come in due time. According to Pat... I've got tonight to figure it out. Less than eight hours, to be exact. Do you have any ideas, Justin? I'm going to go clean the bathroom. [JOEY] Uh... Yeah. [CLEARS THROAT] Have a blast. [MIKE] Hey. [COURTNEY] Hey. So you're, uh, patrolling? Keeping watch, yeah. Don't worry. I think we're pretty safe out here, Mike. Yeah, you're safe. You've got a magic staff. I need a staff. Or a robot. [COURTNEY CHUCKLES] You know, you're so lucky the staff picked you. I wonder, if I would have found it first... maybe it would've picked me. Um... Maybe. [MIKE] Tell you one thing. It would've made my paper route so much easier. [BOTH CHUCKLE] True. Could... Could I try it? Go for it. [MIKE SNIFFLES] Sorry. - It's all good. - Hmm. You know, my dad doesn't have any special powers either. But he still built STRIPE, you know. Maybe one day I can do something like that. For JSA. Yeah. That'd be super cool. [CRUSHER] I am going to rip that little asshat's arms right out of his sockets. - [TIGRESS] The boy? - [CRUSHER] Yeah, the boy. Stripesy, I had him. It's that damn kid that surprised me. My back is killing me. How about you? 
 
 [DOOR OPENS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CRUSHER] Bowin? What are you doing here? Jordan sent me to make sure you don't fail a second time. We don't need your help. Yeah. What are you gonna do? Smash them over the head with your violin? [CHUCKLES] I'm going to immobilize them. They'll be standing still, making them impossible to miss. Even for you two. [CRUSHER] Targets that don't move... Now, what fun is that? This isn't about fun, you sadists. You get too much pleasure from this sort of thing. You both relish in violence. I feel sick imagining how your daughter is going to turn out. She's a wild animal. Just like her mother. You sayin' we don't love our child? No. I'm saying you're unfit to be parents. [CROSSBOW COCKS] [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] I love you, baby. You found the tools? Yeah, thanks. I just needed to check a few things on STRIPE while the kids did their recon. - Pat? - Yeah? Why didn't you tell me about any of this before we got married? Well... I mean, everyone that ever knew, they ended up dead. Sylvester's parents. Our contact in the FBI. I was hoping that this life was behind me. And when I met you... [BREATHES DEEPLY] Well... Our family was all that mattered to me. If I'd have known the truth about Blue Valley... [SCOFFS] ... things would be a whole lot different. Are we gonna be okay? I mean, you and me? I want us to be. [BREATHING DEEPLY] [JOURNAL THUDS] [PAT GRUNTS SOFTLY] Having trouble? What do you think? I know there's a number that will unlock that code. Tried birthdays. Then I figured, my dad was Hourman, so I tried "   seconds, hours,   ". Nothing. [PAT] Okay. A number... What else did he care about that had a number? Who the hell knows, Pat? I never got to know my dad because of the ISA. So what about his car? Is there anything there? - The car... - The Mustang. [STAMMERS] I mean, I don't know, I'm just... Wait. The      Mustang. That's it. Right there. Rick. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Scan this. The formulas were the coordinates of a map for the tunnels. My dad must've gotten down there and scoped it out. I'm scanning the journal now. [BEEPING] [MIKE] Whoa. [YOLANDA GASPS] Whoa. [JOEY] This map my dad made, those are the tunnel entrances. Here. This is their meeting room... in there. Which is where they're building some sort of... Uh, some sort of machine. What machine? The equipment they stole, the satellite codes... They must have used those to build something. [BETH] Something big. Chuck thinks they built something he calls a "synaptic amplifier". It's meant to transmit... Brainwaves. So Henry's dad can reach somebody else's mind? Millions of somebodies. But why? Maybe those creepy guys in the tunnel were just a test run. Right. And now they're getting ready for the big rollout. Are they gonna try to make everyone else zombies or... No. I don't think that's their American Dream. Like Blue Valley, they wanna have people follow their vision and join them and... I guess follow without question. Right, but not if we destroy their machine. Rick, is there a tunnel that STRIPE could get through? Yeah. The river. But don't think I'm not coming with you. No. You, Yolanda and Justin should enter from the opposite side of town. You want us to split up? Only to try to avoid detection. But we'll meet back up at the machine. [BETH] While you guys go destroy the amplifier, Chuck and I can take down the computers running the show. We've traced the town's electrical surges to The American Dream. Chuck thinks we can access their system from there. You know, hack the hackers. Okay, I'm gonna go with Beth. [STAMMERS] Barb, I don't want you going anywhere near this place. Well, you'll let a   -year-old go? I'll be    in May. If there's a problem, I know that building better than anyone else. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] All right. I mean, I don't like it, but what choice do we have? So, we've got a plan. [MIKE] So, uh... What's my job? You, Mike Dugan, have the most important job of all. You're gonna look after the dog. - [BUDDY BARKS] - Okay? Is that really all I'm good for, the dog? [PAT] It's an important job, buddy. Do it with pride. [MIKE] Actually, you know what? I'm excited for this. Let's do it. [CLAPS HANDS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Run wild ♪ ♪ I'm on a mission and I won't stop ♪ ♪ No destination but it's worth a shot ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ ♪ Ready for war I got my armor gear ♪ ♪ Sharpen your swords cuz the time is near ♪ ♪ Gotta do it big like Bon Iver ♪ ♪ I'm a rockstar on a chandelier ♪ ♪ Off the walls, yeah I'm about to go crazy ♪ ♪ Free the beast, ain't nobody that could tame me ♪ ♪ Run wild ♪ ♪ You gotta let me go ♪ [BARBARA] Do you think you can access his system from here? We're going to try. - Okay, the password is... - "New Kids On The Block"? What's that mean? Uh, it's just random words. [DR. MCNIDER] New Kids On The Block is an American boy band who enjoyed success in the late s and early     s and have sold more than   million records worldwide. [BETH] Okay, let's stay on mission, Chuck. We're in! Hey, guys, can you hear me? [COURTNEY] We read you. [YOLANDA] Us too. Okay... What? Last time I was in the tunnels, I couldn't communicate with anyone. So, it's good, right? I guess so. It's just kind of weird. Like, why? [BEEPING] Guys, I found some kind of countdown. [DR. MCNIDER] Beth, this appears to be the ISA's manifesto for the broadcast. [BETH] I think we have   minutes before they turn it on. Whatever they're going to make people believe in,      they call it the "New Constitution". They wanna combat... global warming? Oh, wait! They wanna force people to... They're going to force people to what? Force them to embrace solar and wind power. They're going to eliminate discrimination over race, religion, sexual orientation... You're kidding me. [BEEPING] Oh, and universal health care. That sounds good. [STAMMERS] Is that not good? Hey, Pat, are you sure we're on the right side? There's got to be something else. [BETH] I don't know, Mr. Dugan. The only other thing it says is that once the machine broadcasts, the process will take    minutes. If we don't stop them before then, it's permanent. - Oh, here's more. - [BARBARA] Hmm. It only affects fully-developed minds. [YOLANDA] What does that mean? Adults. [DR. MCNIDER] Barbara is correct. But there is what you would call "a catch" to reprogramming developed minds like this. [BETH] A catch? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] - Oh, no. - [BARBARA] What? Beth, what is it? [BETH] There are people who will fight too hard against the reprogramming process. And what happens to them? Their brains will shut down. They will die. How many? [BETH] Twenty-five percent of their target audience... of     million people. They're going to kill    million people? [SHARPE] Give or take a few million, yes. [STATIC SCREECHING] [SHARPE] Good morning, everyone. You may be wondering what's just happened, so allow me to elucidate. Well, I've just hacked into your hack of our hack, young lady. And with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking? I'm... I... [DR. MCNIDER] She's Dr. Mid-Nite. Is that right? Guys. I don't know what to do. - Child... - [BEEPING] There's nothing to do. We've only got    minutes before they broadcast. You think you have minutes to stop us from broadcasting? [LAUGHING] [RUMBLING] [SHARPE] The broadcast begins at the   -minute mark. It's minutes until Brainwave is finished. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] Mrs. Whitmore? - Mrs. Dugan? - [ELECTRICITY ZAPS] - Barbara? - [ELECTRICITY ZAPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] - Justin. - [ELECTRICITY ZAPS] - Justin! - [ELECTRICITY ZAPS] [WOMAN LAUGHING] [ELECTRICITY ZAPPING] [OVERLAPPING VOICES] I have control over all of them. Like puppets. Like Pat Dugan. Pat? What do we do? [ELECTRICITY ZAPPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Pat? [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN]
