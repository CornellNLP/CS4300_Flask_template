 [COURTNEY] Pat?   
 Stay away from me!   
 [STRIPE] Courtney.   
 [COURTNEY] I mean it, Pat.   
 I can explain.   
 [COURTNEY] So explain.   
 First, I need to get you somewhere safe, okay?    
 [STRIPE WHIRRING]    
 [STRIPE] Let's go.    
 [ELECTRONIC WHIRRING]    
 Come on, you hunk of junk.    
 Is this thing even safe?    
 Oh, my God!    
 Come on, Stripesy.

- Hey.    
 Stop!    
 I... I just need a minute, okay?    
 I'm upset, too. Just...    
 Just give me a minute, please.    
 Are you okay?    
 No, I'm not okay.    
 What is that thing?    
 It's a prototype.    
 I built it after Sylvester died.    
 You built it?    
 Out of old car parts.    
 What did your attacker look like?    
 I don't know. Creepy.    
 - Red hair. 
- [WATER RUNNING]    
 He threw tires at me with his eyes.    
 It was with his mind.    
 [SOFTLY] Ow.    
 He fought my dad, didn't he?    
 Would you stop with that?    
 Who is he?    
 He's called Brainwave.    
 One of the Justice Society's enemies.    
 A member of the Injustice Society of America.    
 The Injustice Society of America?    
 None of you were good with names, huh, Stripesy?    
 It was a different time then,    
 - and look, the less you know... 
- I want to know who Brainwave is.    
 I'm trying to protect you.    
 Did he kill my dad?    
 Starman wasn't your dad, and Brainwave killed a lot of my friends that night.    
 Johnny Thunder, Hawkman, Hawkgirl.    
 So, who killed Starman?    
 [PAT] Their leader. Icicle.    
 Where is he?    
 I don't know.    
 Well, I bet Brainwave does.    
 - Hey, hold on a sec. 
- No, you hold on.    
 There's no way it's a coincidence this psychopath is in the same small town that you are.    
 No more secrets, no more lies.    
 What's Brainwave doing in Blue Valley?    
 [COSMIC STAFF BUZZES]    
 [THUNDER RUMBLES]    
 [WOOD CREAKING]    
 - Someone's downstairs. 
- [WILLIAM] What?    
 I heard them come in.    
 Stay here with your mother.    
 William? What is it?    
 It's the cat, I'm sure.    
 Dad?    
 Hey. There's nothing to worry about.    
 This is Blue Valley.    
 [DOOR CREAKS OPEN]    
 [BEEPING]    
 [INDISTINCT WHISPERING]    
 [WHISPERING STOPS]    
 [WOOD CREAKING]    
 What the hell are you doing? 
I could've killed you.    
 Why are you wearing that?    
 We have a problem, William.    
 It couldn't wait until morning?    
 This girl has Starman's staff.    
 Where did she get it?    
 [CLICKS TONGUE] I don't know.    
 You need to alert the others.    
 - Tell them to be prepared. 
- No.    
 Not until we know exactly what's going on.    
 I called Jordan.    
 He left me in charge. Now, why wouldn't you come to me first?    
 [THINKING]  I know how you think.   
 You're ready to take your family and run.   
 I'll warn you once.    
 Stay out of my head, Henry.    
 I understand your concern, William. I do.    
 But the work we're doing here in Blue Valley is the perfect test case for Jordan's grand plan.     
 It's far too important to us.     
 To our families and to their futures, to abandon.     
 Project: New America is our purpose.     
 Our legacy.     
 It's what we're doing here.     
 Isn't it?     
 [GULPS]     
 Of course.     
 I'm going to locate this girl.     
 I'm going to find out what she knows...     
 And then I'm going to kill her.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 [WHISPERS] William, who were you talking to?     
 No one.     
 - But I heard... 
- Go back upstairs, Denise.     
 This is my business, not yours.     
 [CAT MEOWS]     
 [THUNDER RUMBLES]     
 [COURTNEY] I want the whole truth, Pat.     
 I'm telling you everything, okay?     
 Right now. Geez. [EXHALES]     
 A teammate of Starman's, a member of the Justice Society of America called Hourman.     
 I thought you said they all died.     
 Can I just get through this?     
 It's not easy for me either, you know?     
 Hourman survived that night and he took it upon himself to follow the Injustice Society's trail across the country, from Los Angeles to Colorado to Nebraska.     
 He and his wife died in an accident shortly after they got here.     
 Two years ago I followed Rex's research here.     
 That's when I met your mom.     
 Why'd he give it to you?     
 It's not like he had a lot of options.     
 I was the only one left.     
 Mmm.     
 [PAT] When I got to Blue Valley,     
 I couldn't pick up the Injustice Society's trail.     
 I thought maybe they passed through or even left the country.     
 I never would've moved us here if I thought any of them actually stayed in Blue Valley.     
 I wouldn't put you or your mom in danger like that. Or Mike.     
 If you stopped looking for them, why the big robot?     
 I thought I could help Hourman, but he wanted to go it alone.     
 I never used that robot before tonight.     
 It was the first time.     
 Okay.     
 Brainwave's in this town somewhere for whatever reason.     
 So, let's go find him...     
 - You're being careless, all right? 
- [SCOFFS]     
 Brainwave might not be alone     
 - and he saw you. 
- It was dark.     
 And he finds out who you are and comes here?     
 I don't even want to think about it.     
 You know, you might laugh at those red-and-white stripes I wore, but people looked at those instead of my face.     
 We had costumes for a reason.     
 To protect our families.     
 Costume. Check.     
 - Probably need a mask, too. 
- No.     
 - Upgrade. 
- No costumes.     
 No, no, I... I get it.     
 I totally see your point, Pat.     
 Protect the family. Superhero rule number one.     
 Rule number one is that I'm doing this without you.     
 This has to be the reason the staff lit up because it knows the bad guys are here.     
 This is my chance, Pat, to do something for my dad.     
 Starman wasn't your dad and you're not going to touch the staff ever again.     
 You can't do that.     
 You're    years old.     
 You said you met my dad when he was   .     
 - That was different. 
- How?     
 For a whole lotta reasons that I don't have to explain right now, okay?     
 I'm not going to sit on the sidelines like you did, Pat.     
 Hey.     
 I'm not sitting on the sidelines.     
 [SIGHS]     
 [EXHALES]     
 Brainwave.     
 [WOOD CREAKING]     
 [CHUCKLES] Buddy.     
 Come on, Buddy.     
 We got a fight to get ready for.     
 - You ready? Yeah. 
- [GRUNTING]     
 Let's do it. You scared the hell out of me. Come on.

 What's up, Barbara. Nice suit.     
 Thank you.     
 Dad's making breakfast.     
 It should be ready any minute because I'm starving.     
 [PAT] Yeah, coming right up, little buddy. Just be patient.     
 - Hey. 
- Hi.     
 Hey.     
 - Hey. 
- Hi.     
 [GASPS] Oh, my God! What happened?     
 Oh... I fell down the basement stairs.     
 What?     
 Get them while they're hot.     
 Who's hungry?     
 - Huh? 
- What happened to you?     
 [VIDEO GAME BEEPING]     
 Oh, I...     
 Well, I... I tripped down those basement stairs.     
 You both fell down the basement stairs?     
 Yeah, there's a bad step.     
 Yeah, it's a couple of bad steps down there.     
 I was able to fix it and what I did was... Well, it's kind of an interesting story.     
 I re-planed it and then I     
 - got up under the... 
- Pancakes, wow!     
 Wow, look at these, Mom.     
 Yeah, they look great.     
 Would you like blueberry or chocolate chip?

 Great.

 Mike, language.     
 What do you want me to say?     
 Uh, dang it, darn it.     
 How about a golly gee, is that too strong?     
 That's perfect.     
 [WHISPERS] Thanks for trying with Pat.     
 Right, I'll be off right at  :  .

 I always know. [SNIFFLES]     
 So...     
 Tell me, Junior...     
 Did a girl beat you and your friends up and destroy my car?     
 It was too hard to see.     
 Maybe it was a girl.

 It's weird.     
 Look me in the eyes and tell me what I'm thinking.     
 [SIGHS]     
 That I have to take the bus?     
 I don't know.     
 I'll drop you off on the way to the hospital.

 [SHARPE]  As CFO here  at The American Dream, my focus is, of course, to balance profitability with our extensive philanthropic appetite.     
 As such, the suggestion box for our next community fundraiser is open. So speak.     
 Ideas, folks.     
 Anyone?     
 Yes.     
 Well, Mr. Sharpe, there are so many new restaurants in Blue Valley.     
 I mean, far more than when I was a kid, and back in Valley Village, California, there was a taste of the town once a year.     
 It was a way for the restaurants     
 - to introduce themselves to the commu... 
- No.     
 - But it really helps. 
- Everyone in Blue Valley knows the restaurants already.     
 Bad idea.     
 Any others?     
 [MAN COUGHS]     
 - Yes? 
- [BARBARA] This may sound a bit silly, but the farmers would do Cow Pie Bingo to raise money for the schools way back when.     
 They would raffle off square plots     
 - in a field and they would... 
- It does sound silly and disgusting.     
 Any others?     
 Anyone else with an idea?     
 Well, no one else?     
 I'll come up with something.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTERING]     
 Mr. Sharpe can be... tough.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTERING]     
 [GYM EQUIPMENT CLANKING]     
 - [CRUSHER] Whoa. 
- [GRUNTS]     
 Pat, Pat.     
 Come on, man, don't bring this stuff in here.     
 What are you thinking?     
 - Come on. 
- Hey, Larry.     
 - Ah. 
- Sorry. Uh...     
 - Cru... Crusher. 
- Crusher! That's right, buddy.     
 - How you doing, Pat? 
- Pretty good.     
 You don't look good.     
 - Okay. 
- At all.     
 - All right. 
- What's going on?     
 Well, funny you should ask,     
 I've actually been thinking about maybe getting on a cardiovascular wellness type program that I've been reading about.     
 No idea what you're talking about.     
 Okay, well...     
 Yeah, like, you call it, "Getting ripped".     
 - A little louder. 
- Ripped, right?     
 - Ripped! 
- Yeah.     
 Don't be ashamed to say ripped.     
 That's what we do here, buddy. Let's go!     
 - Grab some clothes off the rack... 
- Okay, I just want to sign up today     
 - and maybe get started next week... 
- Go back there, get changed, come out.     
 - We're getting started right now. Let's go. 
- Okay.     
 - We're starting right now. 
- Yeah, okay.     
 Yeah, come on, baby!     
 Get pumped!     
 This is Crusher's house.     
 Dad used to tell me, "You gotta want pain.     
 You gotta make pain your friend".     
 You're making choices for your future self right now.     
 Your better self.     
 Your better self is gonna thank you for it.     
 How long have we been doing this?     
 Three minutes.     
 Only    more to go.     
 There you go.     
 [CHILDREN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]     
 I love having lunch together.     
 Yeah, the chicken cordon bleu is delicious, honey,   
 but it's a little heavy  for this time of day.     
 I'm so glad you like it.   
 [GAPS] Let's call Dad.     
 - Family lunch! 
 - Honey...   
 [JAMES]  Hey, sweetie? I'm a little swamped right now...   
 I've got Mom on the line, too!     
 - [JAMES]  Hey, babe. 
- Hey, hon. [CHUCKLES]     
 - Dr. Chapel. 
- Mmm.     
 Hello, Henry.   
 [BETH] Is that Dr. King?     
 Hi, Dr. King.   
 Hi, Beth.   
 [DR. CHAPEL]  Honey, who's that with you?   
 Oh, that's Courtney.   
 Well, why don't you have lunch with her?     
 [JAMES]  Yeah, have lunch   
 with your friend, Beth, okay?   
 [CHUCKLES]  Mmm.   
 [DR. CHAPEL] Your father and I have to get back to work.     
 We'll see you at the open house tonight.     
 You'll see everyone at the open house tonight.     
 It's gonna be a party!     
 Love you, Mom.   
 Open house?     
 Yes, I assume you and Henry will be there?     
 Oh, we wouldn't miss it.     
 My parents are the best.     
 Can you stop staring at me?     
 I wasn't...     
 [SIGHS]     
 [PRINCIPAL BOWIN]  I'd like to thank you all for coming to what  is my favorite night of the year here at Blue Valley High.     
 These boys and girls of yours are the future of America, including my own son, Isaac.     
 I love you, sweetie.     
 [AUDIENCE MURMUR]     
 Oh, my God, Mom.     
 [PRINCIPAL BOWIN] I am proud to announce last year's graduating class was in the top  % of the nation.     
 [CHEERING]     
 I'd like to thank a few of the many supporters that made that possible.     
 Councilman Zarick, for his undying commitment to making sure our school receives the funding it needs.     
 Doctors Henry King and Bridget Chapel of the Blue Valley Medical Center...     
 ... for their generous volunteer work supporting our teams.     
 [CRUSHER, MRS. BROOKS, ARTEMIS] 
Go Prairie Dogs!     
 [AUDIENCE LAUGH AND MURMUR]     
 Go Dogs, and, finally, everyone employed by The American Dream, by Blue Valley Tires.     
 The lifeline of this town.     
 Please, stand up.     
 Everyone give a hand to the backbone of this great community.     
 [APPLAUSE]     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTERING]     
 We never come to these things.     
 Why are we here?     
 Go get some punch, Henry.     
 [DR. KING READING PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS]     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 [BETH] It's going to be amazing.     
 I can't wait for you to meet Mrs. Rizamy.     
 No, Mr. Mora.     
 He's the best biochemistry teacher ever.     
 - Hey. 
- [GRUNTS]     
 Me again.     
 These are not on the program.     
 Program? What program?     
 The program that you started today, big guy.     
 I call it Pat  . .     
 This stuff will kill you.     
 You gotta be kidding me.     
 This guy is crazy.     
 History and tradition are undervalued in favor of progress, but passing our ways onto the next generation for them to then improve upon in their own way.     
 That's what life's about.     
 Legacy.     
 My boy here is quite the musician himself.     
 He'll be better than I ever was.     
 A real savant,     
 - and a cute one at that. 
- Mom.     
 My sweet boy is so modest.     
 [COURTNEY] Pat. Psst.     
 Hey, Pat.     
 What are you doing?     
 I'm trying to hydrate.     
 Have you seen anything?     
 Parents, their kids, teachers, a lot of cookies, and stop looking for Brainwave. I got it.     
 We can cover more ground together.     
 You keep checking out the gym,     
 - I'll head to the classrooms. 
- Hey, listen to me.     
 - Court, listen to me. 
- Meet back at the cookies in ten.     
 Hey, hold on a sec. You're not...     
 - Stop standing around. 
- Hey, stop...     
 
 
 
 Hey, move, Patrick.     
 Stop telling me what to do.     
 - Oh. My fault. 
- I'm... I'm sorry.     
 - [LAUGHS] 
- Excuse me.     
 No, it's me. I...     
 Hi, I'm Denise Zarick.     
 Pat Dugan. Hi.     
 - You're new to Blue Valley. 
- Yeah.     
 Me and my family just moved here.     
 - You? 
- Oh, no.     
 No, I've been here a long time.     
 - Mmm, it's seems nice. 
- Yeah.     
 People think so.     
 Oh, I, uh...     
 I have to go. It was really nice meeting you, Pat.     
 Denise, nice to meet you.     
 - Bye. 
- You, too.     
 They say my daughter will be the first woman     
 - drafted into the NFL. 
- Oh, my.     
 You say it, Mom.     
 - Your father does, too. 
- It's true.     
 [CRUSHER] I'm a bragger with this one.     
 [COURTNEY THINKING]  Brainwave.   
 Excuse me.     
 [CRUSHER] You know what they say, it's not bragging if it's true.     
 Your teachers seem incredibly well-educated.     
 I told you, Mom, to stop talking.     
 Pat?     
 Pat?     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 [CHATTING INDISTINCTLY]     
 So, it's you.     
 Hello. Courtney.     
 Stay away from me.     
 You're Starman's daughter, is that it?     
 You keep thinking of him over and over.     
 I have no idea what you're talking about.     
 Yes, you do.     
 [STUDENTS CHATTING, LAUGHING]     
 You'll pay for what you did to my dad and the JSA.     
 You're frightened.     
 Your father was frightened, too, of so many things.     
 You're going to bring me the Cosmic Staff.     
 You're going to come back here with it at midnight.     
 [GROANING]     
 [DR. KING THINKING]  Your mother...   
 ... Barbara.   
 I will kill your mother if you don't bring me the staff.   
 Do you understand?   
 I'll make it look like she had a stroke.   
 I will make sure that her death   
 is extremely painful.   
 Midnight.     
 [GASPS]     
 [GROANING]     
 Hmm.     
 Pat. He's here.     
 Brainwave? Where?     
 He knows who my mom is and he said he'd kill her if I didn't meet him back here at midnight with the staff.     
 What? Where is he?     
 - I... I don't know. He... 
- Okay, hold on.     
 Wait right here.     
 All right?     
 - Wait right here. 
- But, Pat.     
 Excuse me. Barbara, I'm very sorry, but we gotta go.     
 Pat, no, no, I'm talking to these people.     
 Yeah, I'm... [STUTTERING]     
 Well, I'm really not feeling so hot.     
 I had some of those pigs in a blanket over there and can we hit it?     
 - Oh, yeah. 
- Yeah.     
 - So, Principal, Senator. 
- Mmm.     
 - Nice talking to you. 
- Councilman.     
 - Bye, guys. Bye. 
- Bye.     
 Hmm.     
 Um...     
 No thanks.     
 [PAT] Hey.     
 What are you doing?     
 I have to face him.     
 He's going to hurt my mom if I don't.     
 No. All right?     
 You're staying here.     
 He said he'd give her a stroke.     
 He'd make her death painful.     
 When he says that, he's not lying, and he'll do it to you, too.     
 Stop trying to scare me.     
 You should be scared.     
 You understand me?     
 Well, I can't be right now.     
 Pat, my whole life I've waited for my father to show up and now I know why he didn't.     
 Brainwave and the others took him from me, and this staff is giving me a chance to get justice for that.     
 For my dad. For the JSA. 
For... For your friends.     
 I don't care that that staff works for you.     
 - [SIGHS] 
- You're staying here.     
 You listen to me.     
 If I'm not back in the morning, you get your mom and Mike and you leave Blue Valley.     
 You leave and you never, ever look back.     
 - Pat, you don't... 
- Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Stop.     
 You protect your mom. 
You get her out of here.     
 Tell her I love her.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 [BELL DINGS]     
 [KEYS JANGLE]     
 [STRIPE BEEPS]     
 [KNOCK ON DOOR]     
 - Am I interrupting? 
- Hi. No.     
 You getting along with Pat today didn't go unnoticed.     
 I know this has been difficult.     
 The move and a new stepfather and new stepbrother and...     
 - And instant family... 
- [BOTH CHUCKLE]     
 I thought it'd all be so perfect.     
 It's okay.     
 I am grateful for everything that you've been doing.     
 I wanted you to know.     
 Everything's not been as easy as I imagined it would be transitioning here.     
 I know that, but we're going to make a good life.     
 - [NERVOUS CHUCKLE] 
- That's all I want for you.     
 That's all I want for you, too.     
 Come here.     
 You'll always be the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.     
 Thanks, Mom.     
 [SOBS AND SNIFFLES]     
 We're gonna figure this out.     
 - [LAUGHS] Yeah. 
- [LAUGHS]     
 - All right. Goodnight. 
- Goodnight.     
 Who are you?     
 Who am I?     
 Someone looking for justice.     
 [GASPS]     
 Hmm.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [THINKING]  Where is the staff?   
 I'm Stargirl...     
 And that's my sidekick.     
 Great.     
 [COSMIC STAFF BUZZES]     
 [GRUNTING]     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [EXCLAIMS]     
 Come on. Damn, work.     
 [BRAINWAVE THINKING]  You had me worried, at first.   
 - [GRUNTING]  
- A new Starman,   
 that'd be big trouble.   
 A real game-changer.   
 Imagine my relief.   
 No Starman.   
 Just a...     
 ... silly little Stargirl.     
 You'll die for attacking my son.     
 - [STAFF WARBLING] 
- [WHIMPERING]     
 But first, you'll feel such pain.     
 [SCREAMING]     
 I forgot how much fun this is.     
 - Come on. Come on. 
- [ENGINE SPUTTERS]     
 [STARGIRL YELLS]     
 [GASPS]     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [STARGIRL] Pat, are you okay?     
 I'm good.     
 What do we do with him?     
 We found him outside.     
 From what we can gather, your father suffered a seizure of some sort.     
 We're doing everything we can but the best person to help him...     
 ... would've been him.     
 [BREATHES DEEPLY]     
 What if he dies?     
 [PAT] Hey. It's not your fault.     
 His mind short-circuited.     
 [WARBLING]     
 The Cosmic Staff...     
 Is it alive or...     
 I don't know how the staff works.     
 Starman didn't build it.     
 A man named Ted Knight did but...     
 - [WARBLING POWERS DOWN] 
- That's a story for another day.     
 [SIGHS]     
 I never thought there'd be another Starman.     
 Stargirl.     
 - [CHUCKLES] 
- We took down Brainwave.     
 We'll find the others that killed my dad and the JSA and we'll get justice for them, too.     
 I, uh...     
 I just...     
 I can't do this, Courtney.     
 [SCOFFS] What are you talking about?     
 I don't know why the staff works for you.     
 And who know... I mean, maybe you are Sylvester's daughter, as crazy as that might be.     
 But whatever the case, you're the one who didn't give up.     
 You're the one who saved me and stopped Brainwave.     
 - No. 
- You.     
 W-We stopped that freak together.     
 You and me.     
 Come on, sidekick, don't flake on me now.     
 The last time I was a sidekick my partner got killed.     
 Yes, but... This time you have a freaking robot.     
 You can do this, Pat.     
 The staff chose me...     
 ... and I choose you.     
 Stargirl and Stripesy.     
 What about...     
 ... STRIPE? Ooh.     
 Like an acronym. Yeah, like, um...     
 Subatomic... Tactical...     
 Robot, uh, Internet...     
 ... Pat Enhancer.     
 Nailed it. Yes.     
 Yes, that... that's cool.     
 So, which one of the bad guys is next?
