 Where is it? 
 There he is. 
 Easy mark. 
 All by himself. 
 Wallet, car keys. 
 Now. 
 He's a w*nk*r. 
 A loser. 
 Please don't kill me. 
 - No one's gonna miss him. 
 - Don't! 
 Leave me alone. 
 I think I killed a man tonight. 
 I think I killed a man tonight. 
 He fell down and died, right in front of my eyes. 
 The paramedics,  they called it a seizure of some kind. 
 But in truth, I... 
 I believe I was responsible. 
 A month ago,  my theoretical methods on expanding cerebral capacity  were deemed too extreme by my superiors. 
 My funding denied,  I chose to  secretly perform a trial test... 
 on myself. 
 Since then, my headaches have been increasing. 
 And... 
 last week,  I started hearing voices. 
 Tonight... 
 I read a man's thoughts clearly for the first time. 
 Wretched thoughts. 
 He had ended lives before. 
 And he was looking forward to ending mine. 
 I... 
 I think some kind of... 
 instinct kicked in, and... 
 And I... 
 triggered the seizure. 
 I must admit, for documentation,  when I silenced his thoughts,  I felt relief. 
 My migraine... 
 is all but gone. 
 Day One. 
 The trial test... 
 is... 
 a success. 
 I could... 
 hear Henry's thoughts in my head. 
 He had no idea what was going on. 
 He was screaming for it to stop. 
 He was so scared. 
 And I was scared, too. 
 I could feel everything he felt. 
 He... 
 He was... 
 lonely, confused. 
 Sad. 
 I wasn't expecting that. 
 He's not like Cindy... 
 or even like his father. 
 Uh... 
 I know what he did to Yolanda was awful... 
 but I wanna ask him to help us. 
 I know it's a risk... 
 but if he can read minds, then he could tell us who else is in the ISA. 
 Pat? 
 What is it? 
 Our best case scenario  was that the ISA came to Blue Valley  after they killed the Justice Society to hide. 
 To go underground and disappear. 
 But if Dr. 
 Ito is Cindy's father... 
 and he's working for them... 
 ...they're planning something. 
 According to Beth's goggles,  this man was executed  for war crimes, like, a hundred years ago. 
 I'm not sure that it's possible to kill Dr. 
 Ito. 
 He experimented on himself, Court,  until he evolved into something beyond human. 
 Like Cindy, but much, much worse. 
 He calls himself "Dragon King."  He's spent his long life building weapons  designed to kill tens of thousands. 
 How do you know Dr. 
 Ito is alive,  but Beth's goggles don't? 
 Sylvester and I were a part of a different team when we fought Dr. 
 Ito. 
 This was before we joined the JSA. 
 You were part of another team? 
 Yeah. 
 We called ourselves The Seven Soldiers of Victory. 
 There's Robin Hood,  and a knight. 
 And there were eight of you, Pat. 
 Yeah, we always argued about the name. 
 And you had a cowboy? 
 Like the Village People? 
 That's The Vigilante. 
 Crimson Avenger, Wing. 
 They were good men, trying their best. 
 Though each one of them had their struggles. 
 Dr. 
 Ito... 
 He built a living weapon designed to eradicate New York. 
 We destroyed it. 
 The Seven Soldiers never got the credit  that the Justice Society did, but we saved lives, cities... 
 even the world once. 
 I lost touch with all them years ago. 
 I wish I knew where they were. 
 We need all the help we can get. 
 We need Henry. 
 Cindy's house is empty? 
 I can confirm there are no heat signatures of any kind. 
 No one's home, Beth. 
 So where'd she go? 
 School records indicate  Cindy Burman has withdrawn from Blue Valley High  to "study overseas with her mother."  Sure she has. 
 Let me out! 
 Come on! 
 Get me out of here! 
 Please! 
 Let me out! 
 Dad! 
 Look, she came after me, and I would've killed her, too,  if it wasn't for Henry! 
 He's the problem, not me! 
 Dad! 
 I'm gonna kill you... 
 like I killed Mom... 
 if you don't let me out of here, right now. 
 I knew you wouldn't lock up your own daughter. 
 Wait! 
 Help! 
 - Help! 
 - She needs a nap. 
 Turn on the gas. 
 It always calmed her as a baby. 
 -At least her misadventure has revealed... 
 -Dad! 
 - ...the abilities of Brainwave's boy. 
 Now... 
 ...we needn't wait for the father to power my machine. 
 We... 
 have his son. 
 Today I finally realized, I can do more... 
 than read thoughts. 
 I can move things with my mind. 
 ♪ To the one on The flamboyant tempa ♪  
 ♪ Just toss that ham In the frying pan ♪ 
 ♪ Like spam, get done When I come and slam ♪  
 ♪ Damn, I feel like The Son of Sam... ♪  
 I can manipulate objects however I desire. 
 As my abilities continue to grow,  so too does my confidence in them. 
 Henry? 
 Are you crazy? 
 How can you even think about having him join us after what he did to me? 
 People don't change, Court. 
 On the surface, maybe,  but never deep down. 
 That's not true. 
 Or fair. 
 Look at all of us! 
 Yolanda. 
 Me. 
 You. 
 We've all changed. 
 Why not Henry? 
 Henry is his father's son. 
 He didn't think twice about ruining my life. 
 He'll end up hurting all of you. 
 I'm with Yolanda. 
 Helping you against Cindy could be a trap. 
 He could be planning to serve us up. 
 Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith. 
 Right before you fall on your face. 
 I put my faith in all of you, and I'm still on my feet. 
 I wish there was another option,  but right now, we need every advantage we can get. 
 I'm not on any team that includes him. 
 When I was a child,  I begged my father to buy me a rubber ball  that lit up when it bounced. 
 He refused. 
 So I put the ball in my pocket. 
 When he caught me playing with it later,  he told me we were taking it back to the store. 
 In protest, I threw the ball down a well. 
 My father... 
 held me by the ankles over that well,  and told me he would drop me  if I ever disobeyed him again. 
 I can remember looking down into the darkness below. 
 I have felt that way my entire life. 
 Utterly powerless. 
 Like I could be dropped down that well at any moment. 
 Until now. 
 I read a man's mind on the subway today. 
 He was staring at a young woman across from him. 
 His brain full of such ugly thoughts... 
 I rendered him blind. 
 Yet, even so, still I heard him. 
 Panicking. 
 And at that moment... 
 that awful headache returned. 
 As we were exiting the subway together,  I saw another car coming... 
 and I gave him a gentle telekinetic push. 
 When he died... 
 I felt... 
 better. 
 Until I read the next mind. 
 And the next. 
 Jealousy. 
 Rage. 
 Spite. 
 Deviance. 
 No matter whose mind I peer into,  vile thoughts fill up their brains,  and in turn, mine. 
 I have learned the truth about humanity. 
 At their very core... 
 People are monsters. 
 I hate them. 
 Henry? 
 I worry about him. 
 I'm fine. 
 Thanks. 
 A man called. 
 A lawyer. 
 He wanted to talk with you about your father. 
 He'd probably be better off if he died. 
 Shut up. 
 Henry. 
 Dad? 
 Henry? 
 Get out of my way. 
 You said you had news. 
 Not me. 
 "Dragon King."  It's Dr. 
 Ito, please. 
 Good afternoon, everyone. 
 What a wonderful day. 
 Oh, did you make it out of the dungeon today? 
 May I sit? 
 Of course. 
 Please. 
 Thank you. 
 Hmm. 
 I know we've had our conflicts in the past,  but be assured, I am your ally in Project: New America. 
 Why don't you tell them the news, Dr. 
 Ito? 
 Yes. 
 We no longer need to wait for Brainwave to awaken. 
 His son, Henry, is a telepath. 
 The amplifier will be complete within the week. 
 Once it is, we can funnel  Henry's telepathic abilities through it,  broadcasting them across six states,  taking control of ever fully developed mind within them. 
 Carving out... 
 a new America. 
 Our America. 
 Jordan? 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Barbara. 
 Please, come in. 
 I just... 
 I'm sorry for interrupting. 
 I wanted to apologize in person for leaving you in Oakville. 
 Your daughter was in an accident. 
 You have nothing to apologize for. 
 How is, uh... 
 Courtney? 
 Yeah, better. 
 Thanks. 
 Good. 
 That's good. 
 Are you sure you're okay? 
 I just finished a project I've been working on for some years. 
 It took me all around the globe. 
 To London, Tokyo,  all over the States. 
 But it also cost me quite a bit of time away from my son. 
 Given everything I sacrificed, I was hoping,  once it was complete, I would feel... 
 a sense of accomplishment. 
 But I don't. 
 Still. 
 It's nothing the new project won't fix,  or some time with my family. 
 Christine, she would  make a big dinner when I returned from a trip. 
 It'd remind me what I was working for. 
 Thanks again for stopping by. 
 Yeah. 
 Jordan? 
 What are you and your family doing tonight? 
 How long's it gonna take? 
 - I can't believe I'm missing my favorite show. 
 - It hurts. 
 Why me? 
 These meds aren't working. 
 Nothing's working. 
 I'm scared. 
 I hope she dies soon. 
 I'll get the house. 
 Then I get the car, too. 
 Dad? 
 Dad, I heard you. 
 Did I inherit this from you? 
 From whatever you did to yourself? 
 Are you trying to... 
 Are you trying to talk to me? 
 Do you need my help? 
 Can I help you? 
 Can you hear me, Dad? 
 -Hi. 
 -Hi. 
 I never liked Dr. King. 
 He's been in here for months. 
 They should terminate life support. 
 You're right, Dad. 
 People are monsters. 
 Mr. Dugan? 
 Hey. 
 Where's Yolanda? 
 I texted her. 
 She's pissed off. 
 Since Courtney's gonna try and recruit Henry. 
 Why would you even let Court talk to Henry? 
 It is a classic anti-Pat plan. 
 Well, you know... 
 she believed in you when no one else did. 
 I've never sent photos of some girl around. 
 What are we doing here anyway? 
 Well... 
 Court went into a tunnel at school. 
 Beth found another passage in Cindy's basement. 
 I want to know if there's a connection. 
 So you want to check and see if there's some kind  of tunnel network under Blue Valley? 
 Yeah. 
 And I'm hoping the answer might be in one of these. 
 And maybe Beth's goggles can help us piece it all together. 
 I can try. 
 This is why you called us here? 
 To look through old books? 
 Planning. 
 Preparing. 
 Doing the work. 
 You want to be a superhero, Rick? 
 Well, buddy, sometimes this is exactly what it takes. 
 You're not gonna stay to help? 
 I got some family business to take care of. 
 Let's get started. 
 You and Chuck got it covered. 
 I'm working on cracking the code to my dad's journal. 
 But Mr. Dugan gave us instructions, we need to--  My parents died for a reason, Beth. 
 That reason isn't here. 
 Why do hospitals always smell like this? 
 Henry... 
 What do you want? 
 I don't wanna hurt you. 
 Like I did your dad. 
 You hurt my dad? 
 No. 
 I mean... 
 I wasn't thinking--  It wasn't a seizure. 
 It was you. 
 You put him here. 
 Her threatened to kill my mom. 
 He was going to kill me. 
 So you fried his brain. 
 It wasn't on purpose. 
 Did you know your dad was a part of--  The Injustice Society. 
 I know. 
 What all do you know? 
 I know what you know. 
 Help me know more. 
 Help us find out who else is in the Injustice Society. 
 Then we can stop them from killing anyone else. 
 You know they kill people, right, Henry? 
 Joey Zarick. 
 His dad. 
 My dad. 
 Yeah, well, maybe they all deserved it. 
 Joey deserved it? 
 Do you really believe that? 
 He was a nice kid. 
 Yeah. 
 He was. 
 Why aren't you? 
 Do you know what it's like to be able to hear everyone's thoughts? 
 It's hell on earth. 
 You think I'm a jerk? 
 Well, trust me, everyone else is worse. 
 If my dad hurt anyone... 
 he had a reason to. 
 People are monsters. 
 Deep down, they're ugly,  and greedy, and hateful,  and twisted. 
 That's the truth. 
 Life isn't that black and white, Henry. 
 People can be bad, but people can be good, too. 
 And kind, and compassionate. 
 Maybe some of the thoughts you read,  maybe some of them are bad. 
 I mean, sometimes we're hurting or we're afraid,  and we think awful, awful things. 
 Have you tried looking a little deeper? 
 I bet you'd find something better. 
 I really doubt it. 
 Behind the pain and the fear,  it's all about love. 
 People want to love,  and be loved. 
 I think you do, too. 
 What makes you think that? 
 Look where you are. 
 Yolanda told me the way your father treats you... 
 and you're still at his side. 
 I don't know what it must've been like  growing up with him as a father. 
 
 
 
 I can't imagine what he did to you. 
 Get out of here! 
 Okay, okay. 
 I know deep down you wanna do the right thing. 
 Come talk to me when you're ready. 
 Hey, honey? 
 What's going on? 
 Hi, honey, I'm making family dinner. 
 And, normally, I could handle this,  but it's for eight. 
 -Eight? 
 -Yes. 
 The chicken! 
 -What, you're boiling chicken? 
 -Yeah. 
 Barb, if I had known you had invited people,  I could've done the cooking. 
 I know, honey, but you've been so busy  taking care of the kids, and fixing your car,  and I just didn't wanna bother you. 
 Okay. 
 I got this, okay? 
 Come here. 
 Come on, it's okay. 
 -But I need to talk to you about something, okay? 
 -Hmm. 
 Something important that I should've talked to you about  long time ago, okay? 
 - Pat's right. 
 - Hmm? 
 - We need to tell you something. 
 - What? 
 I failed the history test. 
 -No. 
 -You what? 
 No, she didn't. 
 She's joking. 
 Okay? 
 Oh. 
 They're here. 
 Can you get the door, please? 
 -Yeah. 
 -Pat's gonna help save me. 
 Yep. 
 I've got it. 
 Okay, let me put some of this in here. 
 Don't say a word. 
 No more lying. 
 Hey! 
 Psst! 
 Cameron? 
 Hi, Court. 
 Uh... 
 Come in. 
 -Hi. 
 -Hi. 
 You must be Barbara's daughter, Courtney. 
 -Hi. 
 -Hi. 
 I'm Jordan Mahkent. 
 -Oh. 
 -Oh. 
 -It's nice to meet you. 
 -You too. 
 We heard about the accident. 
 - You poor thing. 
 - Oh, I'm fine. 
 Yolanda? 
 Stay away from Courtney and her family. 
 She needs to stay away from me! 
 She thinks your soul is worth saving. 
 I know it isn't. 
 I should kill you. 
 You really think I should die for what I did to you? 
 You can read thoughts. 
 Read mine. 
 I can slash you right now,  and watch you bleed to death, Henry. 
 I'll do it if you come near me or my friends,  do you understand? 
 You betrayed me. 
 I trusted you. 
 I loved you. 
 Yolanda... 
 Stay away from us! 
 Well, this all smells incredible, Pat. 
 Chicken and dumplings. 
 It's, uh, old Dugan family tradition. 
 Well, we actually have a family tradition ourselves, if you don't mind. 
 A Norwegian grace. 
 Oh, please. 
 That'd be wonderful. 
 Don't look at me. 
 I studied French. 
 Rick? 
 I found something. 
 Blue Valley was settled in 1876  by a group of Freemasons who called themselves  "The Other Founding Fathers."  They came here to build a community  free of interference from the outside. 
 You think some old separatist freaks built those tunnels? 
 It explains why the Injustice Society chose our town. 
 They can do whatever they want in secret... 
 hidden... 
 right underneath Blue Valley. 
 So, Courtney... 
 Cameron tells me that you're quite the gymnast. 
 Uh... 
 I... 
 was. 
 In Valley Village, she was the best on the team. 
 - Oh, wow. 
 Really? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 I've always admired athletes. 
 I hear you're quite the artist, Cameron. 
 What kind? 
 Uh, paints mostly. 
 Like his mother. 
 So how about you, Pat? 
 I hear you run the old garage off Main Street? 
 Yeah, I mostly focus on classic cars,  but, uh, you know, in a small town like this,  I take whatever work comes my way. 
 I guess you could do your work anywhere, right? 
 So, why move to Blue Valley,  if you don't mind me asking? 
 No. 
 Uh... 
 Well... 
 The pace, the people. 
 And, uh, Barbara of course grew up here, so... 
 Right. 
 Growing up in the cornfields, and going to the theater,  and living the perfect American life. 
 Mmm... 
 It was not perfect, trust me. 
 Not back then. 
 Uh, Blue Valley's not perfect now, Mom. 
 Oh, it's getting there. 
 Yeah, Blue Valley's going to be an example of a better America  built on the most important building block of all... 
 families. 
 Hmm. 
 If only everyone felt the the same way as us, huh? 
 Well, if it's okay, I'm gonna have some more. 
 This is delicious. 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Chicken dumplings are gone. 
 I see that. 
 Sorry, Jordan, let me grab you some more. 
 No. 
 I... 
 I've got it. 
 Okay. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Excuse me. 
 You're gonna have to give me that recipe, though. 
 That is good. 
 Ooh! 
 Ah, fantastic. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, let me move these for you. 
 -Yes. 
 -Thank you, Courtney. 
 Oh! 
 -Hey! 
 Buddy boy! 
 -Mike, don't feed him at the table. 
 - He's gotta eat. 
 - Mike, not at the table. 
 Down, Buddy! 
 Mike! 
 Get down, Buddy. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 - Sorry. 
 - Wow! 
 - He's a handful, huh? 
 - Yeah. 
 I love you, too, buddy. 
 Pat! 
 Uh... 
 I left something in the oven and it's gonna burn. 
 -Need a hand? 
 -Yes! 
 Okay. 
 Excuse me. 
 I hope that's not our dessert. 
 Yeah. 
 There's nothing there. 
 I think Jordan is Icicle. 
 What? 
 The plate was scalding hot, and he touched it, and he was fine. 
 What, he touched a hot plate? 
 I don't know. 
 Jordan Mahkent? 
 Are you sure? 
 If Jordan is one of them, does that mean Cameron is, too? 
 Like Cindy? 
 I don't know. 
 Is something wrong? 
 No. 
 I just always make this face when I eat too much. 
 It was really great to see you. 
 Hopefully, we can, uh... 
 do something soon? 
 Uh... 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 -Well... 
 -Oh. 
 -Bye. 
 -Bye. 
 Courtney. 
 You do know why I was really here, don't you? 
 Why do you think, Courtney? 
 Because I had to meet the girl my son has been talking so much about. 
 And I approve. 
 Thank you again for your hospitality. 
 Sure. 
 Court! 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 What if we use the Staff to help prove  that Jordan Mahkent is Icicle? 
 Maybe it can recognize his scent. 
 Or... 
 energy? 
 We're not doing anything else  until we tell your mother everything. 
 What is that? 
 What the hell is that? 
 It's, uh... 
 Excuse me, Henry? 
 Your housekeeper told me I'd find you here. 
 I'm Mr. 
 Green. 
 Your father's attorney. 
 I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances. 
 Your father left strict instructions  that if he were to ever befall a tragedy like this,  incapacitated, unlikely to regain brain function... 
 his life support would only carry on for a limited time. 
 And I'm afraid that time is soon coming to an end. 
 I should've eaten on the way here. 
 What? 
 I've prepared some paperwork I'd like to discuss with you. 
 I need his signature. 
 I need this money. 
 You're lying. 
 Excuse me? 
 He knows. 
 I'm a terrible liar. 
 You faked those papers, didn't you? 
 Or something. 
 You just want to take my dad's money. 
 I'm sorry, but no. 
 I've already got the State's signature. 
 I know this is hard, but--  You stay away from my dad! 
 Junior? 
 What's going on?
