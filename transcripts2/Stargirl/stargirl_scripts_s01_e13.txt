 [students clamoring] 
 -[students gasp]  
 -[Mr. Levine] Come on, break it up! Break it up! 
 - Break it up! 
- That band geek's a psycho. 
 He just hit me with his tuba. 
 [Mr. Levine] Take him to the nurse. 
 What's gotten into you? 
 [breathing heavily] 
 He called me Tuba Turd. 
 So you bashed him in the head like that? Look at him! 
 What's your mom going to say? 
 She told me to. 
 Sure, she did. 
Come on. Let's go find her. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 [object thudding] 
 [rumbling] 
 [all screaming] 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 [all continue screaming] 
 [whirring] 
 Mr. Levine? 
 Mr. Levine! 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 [girl] What's wrong? 
 Why aren't you moving? 
 What's happening? 
 Dad, wake up. 
 Daddy! Daddy! 
 Daddy? 
 Daddy? 
 Hello. 
 What's happening? 
 Don't worry, child. 
He'll be all right. 
 What's wrong with my dad? 
 Well, what's happening right now, to your father, and to all of them... 
 They're going to think differently when they wake up. 
 They're going to believe in all the right things. 
 All the things they should. 
 They're going to become better people. 
 Good people. 
 My dad's already a good person. 
 [chuckles] 
 You'll see. 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 [clanging] 
 Pat? 
 Pat! Pat, wake up! 
 Court? 
 Courtney? Your mom's not moving. 
 Oh, don't you worry about Ms. Barbara. 
 [chuckles] 
In less than 30 minutes, Brainwave's reprogramming will be complete... and permanent. 
 Courtney's mother will become a part of our new society. 
 Our New America. 
 Like everyone under Brainwave's little spell. 
 [people shouting indistinctly] 
 Unless of course, Ms. Barbara is one of those unlucky "one-in-fours" that pushes back too hard, or for too long. 
 While they do that, their entire nervous system will shut down. 
 - Mr. Levine? 
- [girl] Oh, my God! 
 - [the Gambler] They'll expire. 
- Mr. Levine! 
 Poor things. 
 Dad? 
 Here, Pat, it's me! 
 It's Courtney! 
 Your daughter. 
 [panting] 
 Ever since we came to Blue Valley, you've been there for me... every time I needed you. 
 I need you now, Pat. 
 I really, really need you. 
 - What's wrong with him? 
- Brainwave's got him. 
 Remember, Justin, you are the Silent Knight! 
 The Shining Knight. 
 Well, I don't know. 
 Chuck. If Brainwave's broadcast is affecting every adult, why not the bad guys? 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] I'd theorize they're wearing a signal-blocking earpiece of some kind, protecting them from the broadcast. 
 Okay. Can we mimic the blocking signal somehow? 
 I'm afraid I'd need to examine one of the earpieces to do that. 
 Beth, Pat's fighting Brainwave's control! 
 What? No, that could kill him, Court! 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 We need help, Beth. 
 I know! I know! 
I hear you, guys! 
 Wait. 
 I hear them. 
 Chuck! That's it, I hear them. 
 When I was under Cindy's house, I couldn't hear anyone. 
 Can we see if there's some kind of signal blockers, like those earpieces, down in the tunnels? 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] 
Great thinking, Beth. 
 I've located several frequency blocking systems within the tunnels below. 
 They're currently off. 
 Because they know we're down there. 
 But, if we can turn the blockers back on, we could free Pat and Justin! 
 You think you can break into my security system that easily? 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] 
He's correct, Beth. 
It's proving difficult. 
 Every time I break through one of his firewalls, he puts another one up. 
 It's a stalemate. 
 If the Gambler's so focused on keeping us out, maybe we can divert his attention elsewhere. 
 What else can we hack into, Chuck? 
 Hmm. How about we target what the Gambler cares about more than anything else? 
 [Beth] What's that? 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] His money. 
 What? 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] I've accessed his various bank accounts, both onshore and off. 
 Hey. 
 -Get out of there! 
-I volunteer every Christmas for the American Red Cross, but there are so many worthy charities. 
 Why pick one? 
 [the Gambler] Stop it! 
 No! 
 Stop! 
 Get out of there! 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] With the Gambler occupied, I've accessed the frequency blockers in the tunnels. 
 I can't keep them on very long, but even a momentary interruption in the signal should disconnect Pat and Justin from Brainwave. 
 [electricity crackling] 
 [computer beeping] 
 Something's wrong. 
 - [electricity buzzing] 
- [gasps] 
 [breathes heavily] 
 Courtney? 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 - Let's get to the machine. 
- Court... 
 I heard you. 
 Every word. 
 I meant every word. 
 Let's go. 
 Is he back to normal? 
 I'm free to slay the dragon. 
 His normal. 
 Great job, Beth. Let's go. 
 It wasn't me, Rick. 
It was my best pal, Chuck! 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] It was a team effort, best pal. 
 [Beth] But we aren't out of the woods... 
 Courtney, your mom's still under Brainwave's control. 
 And if we don't destroy that machine, your mom could still die. 
 Millions could. 
 Jordan? The Justice Society, those kids! 
 I know, Steven. They're here. 
 But, perhaps it's for the best. 
 Alert the others. 
 We'll take care of them, once and for all. 
 [Rick] After we take out this machine, I'm going after Grundy. 
 I'm going to rip that vault door open, and I'm going to kill him. 
 You really think that's gonna help you? 
 Yeah. I sure as hell do. 
 Why? 
 Because I'll know that that thing won't hurt anyone else. 
 It won't make another orphan. 
 - But killing is wrong. 
- Says who? 
 God? 
 Yes. 
 Then God shouldn't let bad things happen. 
 Like my parents being thrown into a tree. 
 So don't try and stop me, Yolanda. 
 [people clamoring] 
 It's empty. 
 Where has the dragon gone? 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 [Wildcat] Court, no one's here. 
 [Stargirl] Yeah. Everyone okay? 
 - [Rick] All good. 
- [Justin] Aye. 
 So, where's this machine? 
 Uh... 
 According to the map, it's through there. 
 [Jordan laughs] 
Look what we got here. 
 That's as far as you go. 
 No more ice mask, Jordan? 
 I've got nothing to hide anymore, Courtney. 
 [chuckles] Anyone else have deja vu? 
 I do. Wasn't that a fun night? 
 [Sportsmaster] 
Time to kill the JSA again. 
 [Justin yelling] 
 - [typing] 
- How 'bout some reinforcements? 
 [monster growls] 
 [monster roars] 
 [grunting] 
 [both grunt] 
 [Dr. Ito] You only came back to die, knight. 
 One of us will today, there is no doubt! 
 [grunting] 
 [groans] 
 You shouldn't have locked me up... 
 Daddy. 
 [grunts] 
 [grunting continues] 
 [Rick grunts] 
 [groans] 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 [roars] 
 Don't. 
 [Rick yells] 
 Rick! 
 [STRIPE] 
Get to the machine, Courtney! 
 -[Stargirl] But, Pat... 
-I've got Grundy! 
I'll protect Rick! 
 Go do what we came here to do! 
 [Wildcat] I got it. 
 [grunts] 
 Court! 
 Go! 
 [exhales deeply] 
 [people screaming] 
 Gambler, loop my signal for the next five minutes. 
 It will continue the reprogramming until I return. 
 Where are you going? 
 To help kill these children. 
 [the Gambler] Jordan, Brainwave's left the machine. 
 You need to find that horrible little girl and stop her from using those goggles before she takes control of our whole damn system! 
 Jordan! It won't matter what happens down there if she gets in! 
 I'm on my way. 
 [panting] 
 [man] Wait, wait! Yolanda! 
 Henry? 
 Henry! 
 We need to get out of here. 
My dad... 
 - He's coming. 
- What? 
 What, I don't understand. 
 The cave-in didn't kill me, my dad didn't either. 
 I've been hiding, wearing these clothes for days. 
 Pretending to be one of them. 
 I know where my dad is, and how we can stop him. 
 You... 
 You remember what I said? 
 How I was sorry for everything? 
 -Yeah. 
-You're all I've been thinking about this whole time. 
 Okay. What's... 
 What's the plan? 
 Where are your friends? 
 [chokes] 
 They were Henry's friends, too. 
 [gagging] 
 I watched Henry die. 
 And now, I'm going to watch you die. 
 [gasping] 
 [thudding] 
 [roars] 
 [roars] 
 [roaring] 
 My turn. 
 [both grunting] 
 I don't have time for this. 
 [groans] 
 Yolanda! 
 Oh, my God. 
 - Yolanda... 
- I killed him. 
 What? 
 I know it's wrong, but I did it. 
 I think the machine's over here. 
 Come on. 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 - Oh, my God! 
- [Wildcat] Whoa! 
 Staff, this is where you come in. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Blow it off! 
 [metal creaking] 
 - Run! 
- Go, go, go! 
 [computers beeping] 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [man] It's okay, I'm right here. It's okay. 
 Love you so much. 
 [woman] Are you okay? 
 [sighs] 
 Mrs. Whitmore? Mrs. Whitmore? 
 Mmm-hmm? 
 Beth? 
 You! You have no idea what you've done. 
 Courtney? 
 - Jordan's here. 
- Mom! 
 No more Dr. Mid-Nite. 
 [whimpers] 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite] Beth? Beth, please help me. 
 [Dr. Mid-Nite screaming] 
 Chuck? 
 [screams] 
 Beth? 
 Oh, my God. Are you okay? 
 [yelps] 
 Are you okay? 
 Barbara... 
 - She's in trouble. 
- I heard. 
 Go save your wife. 
 Pat, you don't need the damn robot! Go! 
 I've got five minutes left... and it's all for you! 
 [beeping] 
 [Stargirl] Beth. 
 He killed Chuck. 
 [sobs] 
 Where is my mom? 
 [Jordan] I want to show you something so you'll understand. 
 Look! Look at what I made. 
 Do you remember what this town was like before I came here? It was dying. 
 We brought it back, better than it ever was. 
 That's what all of this is, to help people. I just... 
 I wanna help people. 
 Tell that to Joey Zarick and his parents. 
 And to Henry King. 
 Over half a million Americans die from cancer every year, Barbara. 
 Every year. 
 What if I told you it would take a half a million lives right now,  but I could cure cancer? Forever. 
 What would you do? 
 No one was going to die because of the way people think. 
 Yeah, but they do. 
My wife died because of the way people think. 
 Because of greed and politics, but I can change that. 
 And it's not too late. It's not. 
 I can still save America, Barbara. 
 It doesn't have to be today, but I can do it. 
 And you could help. 
 And Courtney could. 
 I can protect her from the others. I can. 
 I can keep her safe, and we could go somewhere. 
 We could go somewhere else, and we can start again. We can start anew. 
 You're out of your damn mind. 
 Your wife would be horrified to see the person you've become. 
 You didn't know my wife! 
 [whimpers] 
 
 
 
 I will succeed, Barbara. 
 Look at me! 
 I will succeed and I will kill your daughter, and your husband for what you've all done. 
 I want you to think about that on the way down. 
 - No! No! 
- [Pat] Hey, Jordan! 
 You wanna kill me? 
 Well, here I am. 
 What are you doing up here, Pat? 
 You got no powers. No STRIPE. 
 I'm here to protect my wife. 
 With what exactly? 
 Our daughter. 
 [yells] 
 [grunting] 
 [breathes heavily] 
 [moans] 
 Damn you! Fight back! 
 Fight me! 
 [moans] 
 You stupid animal. 
You stupid animal! 
 [screams] 
 Go on! Get outta here! 
 [growls] 
 And never come back! 
 [groans] 
 You spared the beast. 
 Whatever. My hour was up. 
 Let's go! 
 [whimpers] 
 [Beth] Court! 
 I won't let you stop me. 
 Beth? 
 - Rick, are you okay? 
- I'm fine. 
 Where is Yolanda? 
 Oh, no. 
 [both grunting] 
 Courtney? 
 You can never save America. 
 You're filled with too much hate. 
 [electricity crackling] 
 - [Barbara screaming] 
- [Pat] Barb! 
 Gotcha. 
 [whimpering] 
 [gasping] 
 You saved my life. 
 Just returning the favor. 
 [screaming] 
 -Does this mean I get to be in the JSA? 
-[barks] 
 Oh, I like it. 
 Huh. Huh. 
 [whirring] 
 [Courtney] Look at that. 
 It's like it never even happened. 
 [exhales] 
 Not really. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 [Courtney] Hey. 
 We'll fix the goggles, Beth. 
 Somehow we'll fix them. 
 It's not them, Courtney. 
 It's him. 
 It's Chuck. 
 Well, then, we'll get him up and running, Beth. 
 Okay? 
 Right, Yolanda? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Why you taking all this junk? 
 This is all I have for now. 
 I came to Blue Valley to slay that dragon. 
 But I didn't do it. 
 I did nothing. 
 Hey. 
 You helped us figure out what was going on here. 
 And you helped us stop the Injustice Society. 
 You know that? 
 Besides... there'll be other dragons to slay, Justin. 
 - Other dragons? 
- Oh, yeah. 
 [chuckles] 
 There will be, won't there? 
 Starman, he'd be so proud of you. 
 Of all of you, he would. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm gonna go and find my horse, dear lady. 
 Any other soldiers, I think. 
 Hey, let me know if you find 'em. 
 I'd like to see 'em again. 
 Aye. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you all. 
 Until the next battle, Stargirl. 
 Until the next battle. 
 [engine starts] 
 - Everything okay? 
- Seems to be. 
 At least as far as anyone can see. 
 I wonder what the rest of the world's going to think happened here? 
 They always come up with a story. 
 Who does? 
 The National Weather Service confirmed that it was an earthquake that struck Nebraska yesterday. 
 This tremor ultimately caused a malfunction in a weather satellite.  
 Government officials say that the satellite has been fixed, and an event like that recurring again is impossible. 
 [the Gambler] Oh, Jordan, I told you it was folly. 
 [objects clattering] 
 [chuckles] 
 I see you in there. 
 Eclipso. 
 [chuckles] 
 ["Jingle Bell Rock" playing] 
 Peanut butter cookies. 
 Wow! Those look so great. 
 - Make yourself at home. 
- Thank you. 
 And, uh, I'll be checking in on you. 
 Not too many sprinkles. 
Barb will freak out. 
 - [laughs] 
- Thanks, honey. 
 - That's a great... 
- Thank you. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Oh. 
 Mike, how you doin'? 
You getting enough vegetables? 
 - Oh, yeah. 
- This looks so good. 
 No! This is the last straw, damn it! 
 -[Pat] Mike! 
-[Mike] Golly, gee, Buddy! Stop!

 [wrapper tearing] 
 [Pat reading] 
 I love it. 
 - Really? 
- Yeah. 
 Thank you.
