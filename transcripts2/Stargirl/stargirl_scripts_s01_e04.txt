 [SIGHS IN RELIEF] 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, a pink pen. 
 Really dangerous. 
 [PAT] 
 Hey, guys, breakfast. 
 Let's go. 
 [DOG BARKING] 
 [GIGGLING] 
 [WEAPONS FIRING IN VIDEO GAME] 
 Hey, we got any Pop-Tarts? 
 Eggs won't kill you, pal. 
 The sugar might. 
 [MIKE] 
 Whoever died from too much sugar, huh? 
 [COURTNEY] 
 You're joking, right? 
 No, why? 
 - Good morning. 
 - [PAT] 
 Hey, Barb. 
 Yo, Barbara. 
 We got any Pop-Tarts? 
 Here you go. 
 You got the cookies and cream? 
 Nice! 
 Here you go. 
 Can't have my girl going hungry. 
 - Aw, thank you, baby. 
 - Sure. 
 Not in front of the children. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Please. 
 [MIKE] 
 Hey, what are we having for dinner tonight? 
 Chicken. 
 Why? 
 No, I wanted to bring my buddy Jakim over. 
 Hamburgers are better. 
 Well, you're welcome to bring a friend but the chicken's already defrosting. 
 You can't win 'em all, buddy. 
 Court, why don't you invite a friend to dinner too? 
 Courtney doesn't have any friends. 
 - [BARBARA] 
 That's not true. 
 - I have tons of friends. 
 Thank you very much. 
 [BARBARA SIGHS] 
 All right. 
 Are you okay? 
 You'll make friends, don't worry. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 - Love you. 
 - Love you too. 
 - Bye, guys. 
 - [PAT] 
 Bye, Barb. 
 Later, Barb. 
 Court, you didn't touch your breakfast. 
 I'll eat at school. 
 [PAT] 
 Court. 
 Hey... 
 I know what it's like to lose a friend. 
 Joey wasn't my friend, Pat. 
 He never got the chance to be. 
 We should be out there recruiting new JSA members. 
 Like, now! 
 We can't drag anyone else into this. 
 You said it would take more than us to stop the Injustice Society. 
 I said that we couldn't stop 'em. 
 - That's the same thing. 
 - No, no. 
 It's not. 
 And... 
 If there are other villains in Blue Valley, I need to know who they are. 
 And I need to find them without them finding us. 
 And how are you going to do that? 
 I don't know yet, all right? 
 But when I do, I'll alert the authorities. 
 What if they are the authorities? 
 [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] 
 [STUDENTS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] 
 - [GRUNTS] 
 - Sorry. 
 Ow. 
 - What did she just say? 
 - Nothing. 
 - Henry! 
 - Look, I gotta go. 
 Henry! 
 Oh, no, he didn't! 
 [SCOFFS] 
 [CINDY] 
 What did you just say to my boyfriend, huh? 
 Something dirty, I bet. 
 Listen, he's seen enough of you. 
 Got it? 
 Everyone has. 
 - So stay away from him. 
 - Stop it! 
 What's your problem? 
 You have no idea who you're messing with. 
 Neither do you! 
 You will never see me coming. 
 Hey, Yolanda. 
 Wait. 
 What do you want? 
 I'm just trying to help you. 
 You can help me by leaving me alone. 
 That's all I want from everyone. 
 Get it right this time, Rahiem. 
 Hi, Zeke. 
 How much? 
 That's an exhaust pipe for a dump truck. 
 Yeah, I'm actually working on a dump truck. 
 A pretty big one. 
 $  .  , non-negotiable. 
 Cash only. 
 All sales are final. 
 Deal. 
 Okay, meet you in the office? 
 I'll... 
 I'll carry it in there. 
 [ZEKE] 
 That's right. 
 - Just sign right here. 
 - Thank you. 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 You got some trouble? 
 I woke up in that house all alone, and it was just so... 
 Empty and so quiet and I just... 
 I just had to get out of there. 
 So, I just went for a drive and... 
 I don't know, it just... 
 It just stopped. 
 - Let me take a look. 
 - Okay, thank you. 
 Sometimes cars this old, they just need a little, uh, love and affection. 
 Denise, I wanted to... 
 tell you how sorry I am about your son and husband. 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 I-I-I should take a walk. 
 Well, it shouldn't take me too long to get it up and running. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you, Pat. 
 - Sure. 
 Have a good walk. 
 - Yeah. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Doctor Ito... 
 [DOCTOR ITO] 
 In the beginning, I didn't understand why you brought them together. 
 But now, I've seen the light. 
 I believe in the Injustice Society of America. 
 More than any of the others. 
 And I'll never betray you. 
 Not like the Shade. 
 I appreciate your loyalty, Doctor. 
 Can we have the room? 
 Go to the lab, back with the others. 
 I hear you've kept busy. 
 I've been working on my daughter. 
 Yes. 
 I'm accelerating Project: New America. 
 Tell me what you need to complete your machine, and I'll provide it. 
 Finally, you want me to build it? 
 - I do. 
 And quickly. 
 - Yes. 
 Of course. 
 I know how much this means to you. 
 To me too. 
 One generation's ultimate sacrifice will protect the next. 
 I won't fail you like the Wizard. 
 He was particularly vile to me when I first came to Blue Valley. 
 I'm glad he's dead. 
 May I have his body? 
 Yes. 
 Wonderful. 
 [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - [GRUNTING] 
 - [PUNCHES LANDING] 
 [YOLANDA GRUNTS] 
 [PANTING] 
 You've got to stop following me around. 
 [CHAINS JANGLING] 
 I can't. 
 I said it wrong. 
 It's not you who needs my help, it... 
 It's me who needs your help. 
 [YOLANDA] 
 What? 
 There's something going on here. 
 Yeah, I have a lunatic following me around. 
 No. 
 Here, in Blue Valley. 
 I need you to help me fight it. 
 [GRUNTS, PANTS] 
 Listen, blondie... 
 I don't want anything to do with you, with anyone in this school, and there's nothing you can say to change that. 
 Just... 
 [SIGHS] 
 Come over, tonight, I... 
 Stay for dinner even, I'll... 
 I'll explain everything, and if you're still not sold, I promise I'll never bother you again. 
 Here, text me your number. 
 My mom took my phone. 
 Uh, wait, okay, wait, wait. 
 Um... 
 here, just... 
 Just... 
 Just come, please. 
 :  . 
 I'm not promising anything. 
 See you tonight. 
 - Hey. 
 - What's up? 
 Hi, Mom. 
 Go upstairs. 
 I'll call for you when dinner's ready. 
 Actually... 
 about dinner, um... 
 I got invited to a friend's house, and... 
 I was hoping that maybe I could go. 
 You're grounded, Yolanda. 
 For how long? 
 Until I say so. 
 _     Henry. 
 [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Don't you get it? 
 I don't wanna be your friend. 
 I blew up Henry's car. 
 What? 
 It wasn't on purpose, but... 
 You accidentally blew up a car? 
 Yes. 
 So... 
 So what? 
 So the enemy of my enemy is my friend? 
 I know what he did to you. 
 Who doesn't? 
 [COURTNEY] 
 I... 
 I think you're really freakin' brave, coming back here day after day. 
 I mean, I don't know if I'd be strong enough. 
 I never should've sent him those. 
 He never should've shared them. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 I knew he could be a jerk. 
 But he was so nice to me. 
 After a few months, I thought... 
 it was getting serious... 
 but I guess not for him. 
 I don't think he ever saw me as anything more than the next girl. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 My parents were destroyed. 
 They won't even come near the school anymore. 
 They don't bring me to church. 
 My whole life has changed. 
 They act like I don't even exist. 
 I don't wanna hate anyone, but I do. 
 I hate Henry King. 
 You wanna see how I blew up his car? 
 Yeah. 
 [PAT] 
 Don't tell me there's something else wrong with the car. 
 No, it's fine. 
 - [CAT MEOWS] 
 - [PAT] 
 You going somewhere? 
 I'm leaving for good, and I just wanted to... 
 thank you, you've been so kind and... 
 Where you headed? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Listen, don't trust this town, okay? 
 Why? 
 Because William didn't have a heart attack. 
 He was healthy, he had just been to the doctor. 
 I don't care what they say, he couldn't have, he... 
 Oh, God, forget it. 
 I... 
 I said too much, I... 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Hey, hold on. 
 [DENISE] 
 That's all I have     left of my son. 
 He so wanted to be like his dad. 
 Like his dad? 
 His dad was a councilman, wasn't he? 
 I gotta go. 
 I'm sorry, Pat. 
 I just... 
 I have to go. 
 Wait, wait, Denise. 
 Wait... 
 [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 This is what blew up Henry's car. 
 Yeah, this is also what blew out our retinas. 
 Turn it off. 
 Sorry. 
 Hey, come here. 
 [ENERGY CONTINUES PULSATING] 
 Take five. 
 Don't make me put you back in your crate. 
 I will. 
 Stay. 
 [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 What is this thing? 
 It's called the Cosmic Staff. 
 It belonged to my dad. 
 I thought your dad was that garage guy. 
 Pat's just my step-dad. 
 My real dad.. 
 was Starman. 
 [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 Who? 
 Starman? 
 From the Justice Society of America? 
 [SIGHS] 
 My dad was a superhero. 
 I'm a superhero. 
 [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 I've got a costume and everything. 
 Oh, God. 
 Let me just show you. 
 - [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 - Stay. 
 I got a costume for you too. 
 [ENERGY CONTINUES PULSATING] 
 [YOLANDA] 
 I don't know about this. 
 [STARGIRL] 
 Do you have it on yet? 
 [YOLANDA] 
 Yes, but I look ridiculous. 
 [STARGIRL] 
 There's not a mirror in there, you don't know that. 
 I showed you my costume. 
 [YOLANDA] 
 Okay, yeah, but you look good. 
 Don't be shy, please, come on. 
 No one's home, it's just us. 
 It smells like gym class. 
 It's authentic. 
 So, I have to wear this sad-ass cat suit, while you're, what, Miss America? 
 Stargirl. 
 - Okay. 
 - Don't... 
 Don't worry about the fit, I... 
 I can tailor it, like I did mine. 
 Here, put on the cowl. 
 [SNIFFS] 
 Oh, my God, it smells worse than the suit! 
 - Come on! 
 - Ugh! 
 [POWER SURGING] 
 - Shut up! 
 - [YOLANDA GASPS] 
 How did it... 
 It's one size fits all, apparently. 
 That is so cool! 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Yeah, um... 
 It's kind of tight, though. 
 You look badass. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 So,     what could Wildcat do? 
 Good question. 
 [YOLANDA] 
 You're checking Wikipedia? 
 [STARGIRL] 
 It didn't come with an instruction manual. 
 Okay, here. 
 Powers and abilities. 
 Apparently, he could cut through metal using his claws. 
 [CLAWS SWISHING] 
 [BOTH EXCLAIM AND CHUCKLE] 
 - Whoa! 
 - Oh, my gosh! 
 Okay. 
 - [EXCLAIMS] 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - It worked! 
 - Yeah. 
 It says Wildcat had the agility of a cat. 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 It says he always landed on his feet. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [YOLANDA LAUGHS, GASPS] 
 [COSMIC STAFF HUMS EXCITEDLY] 
 You want me to jump off of a building? 
 I don't want you to. 
 Wikipedia said Wildcat could jump off buildings. 
 Yeah, well, anyone can go on Wikipedia and say anything. 
 It said your claws could cut through metal like butter, and it was right about that. 
 Okay, murdering a toaster isn't exactly risking my life. 
 [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 You're right. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 This is crazy. 
 Yeah. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 - Wait. 
 - [ENERGY PULSATING] 
 No, this was a dumb idea, okay? 
 For months, I've been afraid... 
 to listen to myself... 
 to be me. 
 I'm not gonna do it anymore. 
 Okay, I'm jumping. 
 Yolanda, Yolanda, please wait! 
 [PANTING] 
 Hey. 
 It's okay. 
 Come on, let's take the stairs.

 Dad. 
 [YOLANDA] 
 His name is Icicle, the one that killed your dad? 
 [STARGIRL] 
 Yeah. 
 They call themselves the Injustice Society of America. 
 [YOLANDA] 
 Who came up with these names? 
 [STARGIRL] 
 That's what I've been saying. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Okay, listen, listen, listen, as much as I kind of wanna help, I better get back. 
 If my parents check my room and I'm not in it,    
 - they're gonna... 
 - No phone? 
 - Ground you for who knows how long? 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - Yeah, but... 
 - What else can they do?

 - [GROANS] 
 Hey. 
 Sorry. 
 [YOLANDA] 
 
 
 
 Henry. 
 It's late, where's he going? 
 To see his dad, I'm sure. 
 Henry's dad is one of them. 
 What? 
 He's called Brainwave, he's a supervillain. 
 Actually, that makes sense, hmm. 
 Okay, who else? 
 I don't know, I'm trying to find out... 
 What about the hospital? 
 I mean, wouldn't the villains be visiting Brainwave at the hospital? 
 Or is that the opposite of what they would do? 
 Yes, yes! 
 Oh. 
 You're such a natural at this. 
 Okay, Brainwave's in Intensive Care. 
 All we need to do is sneak in and steal the visitors' log. 
 And by "we", I mean you. 
 I'll create a distraction. 
 Wait, wait, wait, what kind of distraction? 
 It'll be great, and we'll be in constant communication. 
 There are two-way radios in the masks. 
 But how am I supposed to get in wearing this? 
 - Court! 
 - You climb! 
 - Seventh floor. 
 I believe in you! 
 - [SIGHS] 
 [STARGIRL OVER RADIO]

 Brainwave's room is on the seventh floor.

 Zero, just...

 You don't have to bring me dinner every night. 
 Well, Dad's out on the road, and, you know, I thought it'd be nice. 
 It is. 
 But you should spend time with friends, instead of worrying about me or your father. 
 But you and Dad are my best friends. 
 No more.

 Is that even a thing?

 Yolanda?

 Look, just Henry. 
 No one else. 
 Not even Principal Bowin. 
 Why wouldn't she sign in? 
 So that no one knew she was there. 
 We have to investigate.

 Actually, Courtney, I don't think I'm your Wildcat.

 What? 
 Why not? 
 I mean, don't get me wrong, today was awesome, and I appreciate that you chose me... 
 - Yeah, you... 
 You were great... 
 - Thanks. 
 - The way you... 
 - But... 
 When those photos got around... 
 I was ashamed to be Yolanda Montez. 
 I didn't want to be me. 
 But the truth is, I need to get my own life back before I put on a costume and be someone else. 
 Can't take all this on right now. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 I don't need to be Wildcat. 
 I need to be me again. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Sure. 
 [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH ON TV] 
 - Hey, everyone. 
 - Were you outside? 
 I thought you were supposed to be in your room? 
 Where were you, Yolanda? 
 Why do you always have to yell at her? 
 - Quiet, Alex. 
 - Okay, please. 
 I need you to really hear me. 
 All of you. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I made a mistake. 
 I trusted someone I shouldn't have. 
 I did something I shouldn't have. 
 [INHALES SHARPLY] 
 And what I did... 
 brought shame to our family. 
 I know that. 
 And I'm sorry. 
 But that was months ago. 
 I feel like I've learned my lesson. 
 And I've been punished enough. 
 And I'm not going to apologize any more. 
 You're my family. 
 I love you all so much. 
 So, I'm asking for your forgiveness. 
 Help me move forward with my life so that... 
 I can be the Yolanda Montez I used to be. 
 You'll never be the Yolanda Montez you used to be. 
 You disgraced this family. 
 And you disgraced yourself.

 So, you back again, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 I was looking for, uh, some construction equipment. 
 Today, I wanted to get a, uh... 
 A stretch of caterpillar track. 
 What are you building, Dugan? 
 A tractor? 
 - No, I was working on a... 
 - Tank? 
 - Uh... 
 - Let me guess. 
 You're picking parts off my lot to build a time machine or something. 
 [LAUGHS]

 No, I'm... 
 I'm, actually, uh, working on a, uh, vintage riding mower, that's all. 
 Hmm. 
 Leading the good life, huh, Dugan? 
 Yeah, nothing too exciting. 
 Back down on the left, past the crushed Caddies, you might find what you need. 
 Back on the left by the Cadillacs.

 Yeah, you too.
