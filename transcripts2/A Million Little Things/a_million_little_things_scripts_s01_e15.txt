 EDDIE: You can't imagine how fragile life is until...   
 - No!! 
- ...it's too late.   
 When Jon left us, he exposed the truth...   
 He found your necklace. Jon knew about us.   
 ...and our secrets spilled out...   
 KATHERINE: So, every time I was with her, you were humiliating me.   
 Do you love her?   
 ...but we had to push through...   
 - This is our baby. 
- Stop.    
 I-I think we should get a divorce.    
 ...for ourselves...    
 - You ever feel down... 
- Everybody feels sad, son.    
 - It's just a part of life... 
- for each other...    
 We have to be there the same way Jon would be had it been one of us.    
 I've known you your whole life.    
 You ever want to tell me that Ella's a boy, I'm glad to hear that.    
 ...because what other choice is there?    
 Dare me to do anything.    
 I dare you to get chemo.    
 KEVIN: She's finally gonna solve it.    
 BOTH: Linda! Linda! Linda! Linda!    
 Linda! Linda! Linda!    
 Damn it. It's jammed.    
 What... What's the pink stuff?    
 Uh...    
 Must be Rachel and that damn gum.    
 [SIGHS]    
 I-I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.    
 Just my luck.    sessions later, and I almost cracked it.    
 Hey, the good news is that we're both about to get out of here pretty soon.    
 - Oh... 
- No offense, Kevin.    
 No, I get it.    
 Your tumor's small enough to operate, and you don't need ol' Kevin anymore.    
 - GARY: What do we have here? 
- [DOOR CLOSES]    
 Oh, my God.    
 - Oh, my... 
- It's the love of my life.    
 And Maggie.    
 Wait.    
 Hey.    
 This is the Gary you're dating?    
 Ohh, Maggie.    
 Just admit it, Linda.    
 You want to have your way with me.    
 I do, Gary. Just not the way you think.    
 My way involves a chloroform rag and a wood chipper.    
 - Wow. 
- That's on me.    
 We had "Fargo" going on a loop in here.    
 - Oh. 
- How do you know...    
 - Linda? 
- Yeah.    
 Linda and I fought cancer together.    
 Hmm.    
 And Jon and I survived this...    
 Her obsession with this nerd toy.    
 Oh.    
 Rachel put her gum in here?    
 I don't know what she sees in you, Mendez, but you better treat her right.    
 He is. He's taking me to Plymouth Rock today.    
 It's the last thing on my bucket list.    
 Which you don't need because bucket lists are for people who aren't gonna make it, and you, my dear, now have an   % chance of beating this.    
 Don't make promises you can't keep.    
 KEVIN: Hey, hey.    
 Chair One, let's keep it positive, all right?    
 Big smiles!    
 Thank you, Kev. Thank you.    
 First rule of beating cancer...    
 - You got to... 
- Believe.    
 - ...you can beat cancer. 
- Okay, Tony Robbins.    
 You can keep it positive, but I've got cancer surgery on Monday...    
 - [SNIFFS] 
- ...so I'm gonna keep it real.    
 All right, well, if we're really keeping it on the    , the Pilgrims did not actually land on Plymouth Rock.    
 We all know that, right?    
 They landed in Provincetown or someplace, like, a month before.    
 So what were they doing for a month, huh?    
 Just driving around? Looking for parking?    
 Tough room.    
 Hey, so I found that car seat.    
 You were right. You did give it to us.    
 Oh.    
 I think the Cheerios were Theo's addition.    
 - Great. 
- Uh, not exactly.    
 Apparently, it expired six years ago. And, yes... car seats do expire, according to all the angry Mommy Blogs.    
 Anyway, I'm about to head into a mediation session with Katherine, but why don't I meet you later?    
 I can help you grab everything you need and install that car seat.     
 That would be great. Thank you.     
 How's it all going with Katherine?     
 [INHALES DEEPLY] Pretty smoothly, all things considered.     
 I'm so sorry, Eddie.     
 Don't be. What happened with us... well, Katherine and I had problems long before that started.

 I was telling Rome how I got a guy to redo my hardwood floors cheap since the poor b*st*rd's between gigs.     
 Well, good for you and the poor b*st*rd.

 All right, well, you can sell your home now and divide the proceeds or you can defer the sale to a later date.     
 Theo's never lived anywhere else.     
 No, I agree.     
 It's best for Theo to stay here in the house with his mom.     
 All right. Have you, uh, given any thought to how you're gonna divvy up the communal assets?     
 Like, uh, this table, for example.     
 Eddie can have the table.     
 No, you keep the table. Really.     
 You... take it.     
 Huh. Most couples fight to keep things,     
 not the other way around.     
 No, it's just...     
 Uh, we just have a lot of history with this table.     
 Hmm.     
 How about we decide on the furniture when you're not charging us $    an hour?     
 Sounds good, Counselor.     
 Next up... Theo's legal guardianship.     
 You have designated Jon and Delilah Dixon.     
 Now, is that still the plan?     
 Jon passed away last fall.     
 I'm sorry.     
 So would you like to delegate Delilah, then, to be the sole guardian?     
 - No. 
- Probably not, no.     
 I get it. You know, many couples aren't comfortable with the idea of a single-parent household.     
 No, it's not that.     
 I know plenty of single mothers who are great at raising their children, Delilah included.     
 Well, yeah, I mean, if she's still grieving, then...     
 It's not her grief. She slept with my husband.     
 If he needed a place to stay, why couldn't he just ask me himself?     
 Probably 'cause he knew you'd make that face.     
 I'm not making a face. This is my face!     
 You still mad about Stasia dinging your car.     
 They... She ripped off my fender and my taillight, Pop.     
 Well, he had no money to pay for it back then.     
 He ain't got no money now, and I didn't want him to pay for it.     
 I just wanted him to admit that she did it.     
 I wanted him to take responsibility.     
 For once. For anything.     
 Sometimes being the older brother means being the bigger person.     
 Sometimes? Pops, I'm always the bigger person!     
 I had to give him my miniature Empire State Building because he left his Statue of Liberty on the train.     
 A-And investing in his "juice business" that was gonna "pay for itself"?     
 Side note... itself still owes me  ,    bucks.     
 And... And, yeah! Oh, yeah!     
 Pretending that somebody else backed into my car when my paint is all over her damn bumper.     
 Come on. Everybody knew Stasia bumped into the car, Pop.
