 I really want a tomorrow with you.   
 GARY:  When trust is broken...   
 Don't go. I need you to help me get through this.   
 ...it's hard to forgive...   
 What's going on? Did he say?   
 GARY: Elliot is not as open with his family.   
 You outed a   -year-old.   
 ...hard to rebuild...   
 ROME: But the money for the restaurant came from Neil.    
 - Who's Neil? 
- Her uncle.    
 ...hard to go on.   
 When I was younger, I let him touch me.    
 What he did was sexual assault.    
 But somehow, we do.   
 I'm giving away the money to a women's shelter.    
 We take a chance...   
 Your mom is sitting by herself in a restaurant. Talk to her.    
 Maggie.    
 ...open our hearts...   
 Jon... I just wish I could talk to him.    
 You have to forgive yourself.    
 ...and protect what we have left.   
 Jon left you money.    
 - We don't want it. 
- Mitch.    
 I don't want my son finding out    
 I've been lying to him his whole life.    
 I think Jon might be my father.    
 - ROME: Hold on! 
- I shouldn't have said anything. I got to go.    
 - [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
- What the hell are you talking about?    
 You think that Jon might be your father?

 After... after Jon died... your friend Gary came to our house.    
 He was looking for my mother.    
 Your mom is Barbara Morgan?    
 It's Nelson now.    
 And you're just telling me that?    
 I'm sorry. It's just...    
 [SIGHS] it's been a lot to handle.    
 Look, when Gary came to our house, looking for my mom,    
 I-I couldn't hear what they were saying, but after he left, my dad was pissed.    
 BARBARA: It's fine, Mitch. He's gone.    
 MITCH: What if Patrick finds out? Huh?    
 He can't know we lied to him.    
 Okay, s-so maybe Mitch isn't your biological father, but that guy Dave... he was your mother's boyfriend back then.    
 I-I know, but I found a video.    
 I know about the video. Dave was Jon's best friend.    
 Have you seen it?    
 Barbara...   
 as guilty as I felt   
 for Dave getting on that plane without me,   
 I felt even worse   
 for what happened after, between us...   
 not being there for you and the baby.   
 I left you.   
 Just when you needed me most.   
 He kept apologizing, like what he left her with... was me.    
 I think something happened between Jon and my mom after Dave died.    
 That's why I was at the hospital the day we met.    
 I followed Gary there, trying to find answers.    
 But... But instead, I found your script.    
 So, your whole act about being depressed, that was just...    
 No, no, no, that was real.    
 Your script... so true to me, a-and it got me thinking.    
 Jon obviously suffered from depression, just like I do.    
 M-Maybe I got it from him.    
 It's just another connection, right?    
 I mean, why was leaving a tape for my mom the last thing that Jon did?    
 That wasn't the last thing Jon did.    
 The last thing he did was leave your mom a half a million dollars.
