 Previously on "A Million Little Things"... 
 This stay-at-home dad was once the lead singer in a band who opened up for Kings of Leon... 
 ALL: Right over there. 
 Of course, that was a decade ago. 
 I cannot be your therapist. 
I can refer you... 
 When Gary called to tell me about Jon, I had a mouthful of pills. 
 I-I don't have the courage to talk to anyone else about it. 
 Friday at  :  . It's my lunch hour. 
 I will have lunch with you as a friend. 
 Thank you. 
 EDDIE: And where did you meet this one? 
    bucks says his breast cancer support group, and if I'm right, you're gross. 
 And you're    bucks richer. 
 [GROANS] 
 What? 
 It's just, uh... 
 GARY: Who was that? 
 Someone from my past. 
 You haven't told me anything. 
 What are you so scared of? 
 This is just supposed to be fun. 
 Well, right now, this is not fun, so maybe come back when it is. 
 Are you having an affair? 
 When you and Delilah were having s*x. 
 Who else knows? 
 No one knows. 
 EDDIE:  Katherine found out about us. 
 Gary and Rome know, too. 
 How could you?

 How's your dad doing? 
 Didn't sleep great, so his memory's not good. 
 Sitting right here... with an empty glass in my hand. 
 Well, on the plus side, he doesn't remember he's a pain in the ass. 
 - Here ya go, Len. 
- Thank you. 
 And I'm not a pain in the ass. 
 Hearing's great, by the way. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, Soph, you're just in time. 
 Len, tell your granddaughter about how I met her mom. 
 I know what you're doing. You're quizzing me. 
 Oh, I am not. 
 I just like reliving the moment that I met your daughter. 
 [SIGHS] Can we not? 
 I've heard this story a thousand times. 
 Can I just go hang with my friends? 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. You know the rule. 
 Friday nights, we eat at home, but everybody's invited to pizza night. 
 And make them hear the story? 
 Yeah, then they n't be my friends. 
 It all started in an airport.

 - There we go! 
- Oh, God. 
 He was on his way to L.A., and she was on her way to France.

 Typically, a regional recurrence after a mastectomy is... 
 Well, it can be a forerunner for simultaneous or subsequent metastases. 
 I bet you say that to all the girls. 
 Given that your cancer is now in your lymph nodes, we need to move swiftly. 
 First surgery, then systemic chemotherapy and radiation. 
 I've laid out your treatment plan in here. 
 You understand that you have cancer regardless of whether or not you take this, right? 
 [CHUCKLES] Yeah. 
 Um... 
 I-if I do nothing, no treatment, how long do I have before it gets bad? 
 Best guess... 
 Three to six months before your symptoms progress. 
 ♪ 
 And after that... how long? 
 If you do absolutely nothing? 
 You won't live beyond a year.

 No, I can't go. I can't go. 
 Kids are off from school. 
I think Danny has a fever. 
 I shouldn't leave him alone with Sophie. 
 I'm not sick. 
 D, we discussed this. Contractor starts Monday. 
 Regina's finalizing the layout today. 
 You're the designer, so you should be there. 
 - No, I shouldn't. 
- [SIGHS] 
 Kid, I'm gonna need you to grab me a chocolate milk from the garage fridge. 
 Get yourself one as well, but let's be clear. 
 If there is only one left, it's mine. 
 Bye, Daniel. 
 - Goodbye, Gary-san. 
- [DOOR OPENS] 
 You got to stop avoiding Regina. 
 - It's been a week. 
- [DOOR CLOSES] 
 I get it. Your adult playdates with Eddie... upsetting. 
 But she's your best friend, and you've got to talk to her. 
 I did. I sent her a bunch of texts. 
 She didn't reply. 
 Okay, if Eddie and I can come together [CHUCKLES] and talk, like the evolved humans that we are, then you two definitely can. 
 You and Eddie got into a hockey fight   feet away from Bobby Orr and you haven't spoken since. 
 Okay, but... I fist-bumped Mr. Orr. 
 [CHUCKLES] Actually, I-I bumped his high five. He... And... 
 - Then he shook my fist, and that was awkward. 
- [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] 
 But... Ooh, I'm sorry. Got to take this. 
 - Hello? 
- ROME: Hey. 
 How's it going over there? 
 Uh... I like chicken. 
 Oh, is she right there? 
 Chicken sounds great. 
 Well, take a look at the chicken. 
 Is she an... Why am I talking in code? Is she pissed off? 
 It's a   -piece, Colonel. 
 Well, push through, because I'm done losing friends, okay? 
 And once these two kiss and make up, they'll be thanking us. 
 There'll be high-fives and fist bumps all around. 
 Unless, of course, it's you, at which point, they'll be like a combination of both... Weird. 
 Stay strong. Okay, I gotta go. 
 So... big day. 
 Yep. Big day. 
 Designing your own restaurant, second chance at your dream. 
 You're doing that thing where you talk a lot for no reason. 
 Sorry. 
 Speaking of second chances... 
 We talked about this. 
 I know, but she's your business partner, not to mention your best friend. 
 Jon left that restaurant to the both of you. 
 Yeah, well, I am guessing he did that before she slept with his best friend.

 Sorry. Gotta get to work.

 You might as well wipe the counter with E. coli. 
 [WATER RUNNING] 
 Katherine, what are we doing? 
 I have a meeting near Theo's school, so I can do pickup. 
 That's not what I'm talking about. 
 I know, Eddie. That's as far as I've gotten. 
 I don't know where we go from here. 
 I'm still trying to figure out how we got here. 
 I could blame it all on you and Delilah, but... 
 ...the truth is, we were broken long before that.

 In fact, I'm great, because now I can tell the contractor that there is brick behind this wall. 
 That is great news.

 Okay, I should've told you. I'm sorry. 
 That's why you're mad? 
 I'm mad because if you had told me, then maybe I could've been there for you. 
 Maybe I could've been there for Jon.
