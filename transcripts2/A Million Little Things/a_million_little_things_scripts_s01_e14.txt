 GARY: After a tragedy, you grieve.   
 That's what you do.   
 It doesn't make any sense.   
 Nothing about suicide makes sense.   
 - And then... 
- I don't know what you're doing later, but...   
 - I, um... 
- Sorry. I didn't realize you were already part of a duo.   
 ...life goes on.   
 You're not giving up on the restaurant.    
 That is your dream.    
 How are we gonna pay for it?    
 At least, you hope it does.    
 We're not out of the woods yet.    
 We need to continue the chemo so that surgery is an option.    
 But to truly heal...    
 I think we should get a divorce.    
 ...we need answers, Jon.    
 You know somebody named Barbara Morgan?    
 Jon made her the fourth beneficiary.    
 We need the truth...    
 - Who lives here? 
- No idea.    
 ...and I'm determined...    
 Oh, my God.    
 It's the view from the painting.    
 ...to find it.    
 B. Morgan.    
 Barbara Morgan.

 Hey. Can I help you?    
 Yeah, I sure hope so.    
 I'm looking for Barbara Morgan.    
 Uh,     Wickenden Street, Number  .    
 That's the address I have for her.    
 Well, you're in the right place, but I'm sorry, there's no one here by that name.    
 Yeah, I see the buzzer says "Nelson."    
 I just really need to find this woman.    
 Were you a friend of... Jon's?    
 How do you know Jon?    
 I don't, but a woman came by here, spoke to my husband.    
 Right.    
 Uh... was her name Ashley?    
 I think so.    
 She said that, um...    
 Do you have any idea why he killed himself?    
 Oh, God. I'm sorry.    
 - No, no, no, no, no. It's okay. 
- Sorry.    
 It's okay.    
 We don't.    
 I was hoping Barbara Morgan might have some answers.    
 Well, my husband and I have been living here a couple years now.    
 Maybe she lived here before us.    
 MAN: Honey, is everything okay?    
 Yeah, it's fine.    
 Um, I-I really hope you find what you're looking for.    
 Yeah, me too.

 And we get it. You know?    
 You didn't want to leave a paper trail, but now's the time.    
 Tell us about the women.    
 I want to hear about every sexual encounter you had on or off that bus.    
 Sorry to disappoint you guys.

 Ah. She's bald, but she has cool, sexy, colored wigs.    
 - [CHUCKLES] 
- She's one round of chemo away from getting the surgery, so... pretty good.    
 - That's fantastic. 
- And get this.    
 This guy hired a private investigator.    
 I did not hire her. 
She works at my office.    
 He's like a dog with a bone.    
 No, he's like a dog without a bone still trying to find his bone.    
 I would simply like to understand why Jon left one-quarter of his life-insurance policy to someone that we don't know.    
 What if we never know?    
 Oh, I'm gonna figure it out.    
 Just like I'm gonna figure out how you managed to go on a sexless rock 'n' roll tour.

 Service standards, house cocktails, et cetera, et cetera.     
 Let's review the menu, shall we?     
 Honey, did you make these?     
 Yes. Is there a problem?     
 You spelled "flambé" with an "R."     
 Uh, I-is that right?     
 [CHUCKLES] It's French, Mom, so it's either "flamber" with an "R" or "flambé."     
 Then I would need an accent aigu.     
 You can ask Delilah.     
 She spent    years of her life in France.     
 Okay.     
 The grilled scallops are prepared with celeriac and spicy peanuts.
