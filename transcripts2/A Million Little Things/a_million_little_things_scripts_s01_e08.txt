 Ash, what are you doing here?   
 Just tying up odds and ends.   
 You got to love odds and ends.   
 - Shut it down. 
- What?   
 John specifically said "Do not have s*x with her."   
 I-If I do nothing... No treatments...   
 How long do I have?   
 You won't live beyond a year.    
 Winner takes all.    
 If I beat you, you're gonna fight cancer.    
 If I win, I am not getting any treatment, and you can't mention it ever again to me or anyone.    
 Game on.    
 I win!    
 Dare me to do anything, and make it really hard.    
 I dare you to get chemo.    
 Game's over. I can't believe you said that.

 I just want what's best for you.    
 GARY: Seems like a good dude.    
 We're working on a case together.    
 Well, I hope you win.    
 You deserve to be happy, Katherine.
