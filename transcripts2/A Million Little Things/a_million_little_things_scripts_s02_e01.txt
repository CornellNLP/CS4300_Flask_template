 A Million Little Things -   02x01   - Coming Home    
 GARY: This isn't a story about losing our friend.   
 This doesn't make any sense. 
This is Jon. Perfect Jon.   
 It's about finding our way through it...   
 SOPHIE: We want you to have something of Dad's.   
 ...together.   
 Maggie, you're in remission.   
 - Oh, thank God. 
- [LAUGHS]   
 But how can we...   
 I'm looking for Barbara Morgan.    
 She may know things about my husband.    
 ...without confronting the past?    
 Were you two together?    
 MRS. NELSON: I dated his roommate.    
 Jon was supposed to be on that flight.    
 He wouldn't let himself move past it.    
 I had to. I was pregnant.    
 Whatever the cost.    
 Your son doesn't know what happened to his father?    
 Mitch is his father.    
 Because even the best-kept secrets...    
 I thought you were pregnant.    
 - I kinda liked it. 
- ...unravel...    
 So, every time I was with her, you were humiliating me.    
 Do you love her?    
 ...and change everything.    
 I can't lie to you. This is your baby.    
 So we adapt...    
 - You're having a baby today. 
- Mm!    
 ...keep fighting...    
 I've had days like that, when I couldn't breathe.    
 ...and just hope...    
 Can we not try to save this?    
 ...love will be enough.    
 EDDIE: Can you come out here? Alone?

 It's not Jon's baby.

 [BABY CRIES]     
 Hi. Shh. Shh.     
 So, they're sending one over from their store in Pittsfield.     
 I don't know what pisses me off more, that they're out of this crib, or that they tried to make up for it by buying you another ice cream cone.     
 This is unbelievable.     
 It's fine. It'll be here by tomorrow afternoon.     
 Yeah, but my daughter comes home today.     
 I can't even get her a crib.     
 I can't even call her my daughter.     
 And tonight, when I tuck my son in, he's gonna ask me where his mother is.     
 So you'll understand why I can't wait for them to get another one of these in from Pittsfield!     
 [INDISTINCT TALKING]     
 Wait.     
 Should...we...     
 Technically, we already paid for it, so... it's not really stealing.     
 Wait, wait, are... are we...?     
 Lift with your knees. One, two...     
 Hey, hey. Where are you going?     
 With me here, they're gonna think it's stealing.     
 Three.

 Rome, can you grab this, please?

 Gare?     
 Hey, your seat on the Supreme Court is safe.

 What? No, I meant grab the crib.     
 Congratulations, Ed, you got a lot going on in there.     
 Just get the phone.     
 It's from Katherine.

 "She's here, Eddie."     
 She's here? W-Where? Where is she?

 Uhp, they're gone. Oh, they're back!     
 Yeah, we can see, Your Honor.

 "Chung-morning"?

- Uh, that's auto-correct.     
 Auto-correct changed it.     
 That... that... that means Chung-Mo.     
 That's still not a thing.     
 Chung-Mo means mother-in-law in Korean.     
 She always signs her texts, it always changes it.

 Listen, Katherine is at her mom's.

 Alright... Hey, man, but as soon as we get to the house, I'm wiping this thing down.     
 Whatever, dude.     
 I don't know where it's from, my boyfriend got it for me.     
 Oh, that's him right now.     
 Uh, guys, Gary says he's gonna meet us at the house.

 My only job is to feed my baby, and I can't even do that.     
 Maybe it's time I... I try formula.     
 No! No!     
 You said you breast fed your other two children.     
 Why would you deprive your daughter of what's best for her?     
 You shut up!     
 Excuse me. Are you talking to me?     
 Is there anyone else in the room who needs to shut up?     
 No, shut your face.     
 She's trying.     
 She's been trying for the last two days, and that entire time, you've made her feel like she's a bad mother just 'cause she can't breast feed her baby.     
 Studies have shown...     
 What part of "shut your face" did you not understand?     
 [LAUGHS]     
 I'm gonna have a baby someday, and thanks to my double mastectomy, I am never going to be able to breast feed.     
 You know what I am gonna be able to do, though?     
 Be a fantastic mother.     
 Because she is my friend.     
 And I will learn from her.
