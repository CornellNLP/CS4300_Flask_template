 Yes! 
 You're not gonna believe this. 
 Jon killed himself. 
 If you hadn't called to tell me about Jon, I would be dead right now. 
 I had a mouthful of pills when I answered that phone. 
 - I don't know anything about you. 
- I know. Isn't it great? 
 Ohh! 
 Here's the lease. Sign here. 
 Wait, why do I have to sign? 
 Didn't Jon tell you? 
 He left the restaurant to both of you. 
 - I'm in love with someone. 
- What? 
 She's the mom of one of my students. 
 He found your necklace. It was in his nightstand. 
 Jon knew about us. We can't do this.
