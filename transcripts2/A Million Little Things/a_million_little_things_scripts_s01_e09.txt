 [TV SHUTS OFF]     
 You had s*x with Ashley?     
 [WHISPERS] Is that bad?

 He also said life is short, be happy.

 [SIGHS] When I was   ,     
 I lost my best friend...     
 My brother.     
 He was your age.     
 Any one of you could have been his friend, could have been the one to stop him from drinking and getting in that car, but you didn't.     
 And neither did I.     
 I'm ashamed to admit this, but when I first got that call, I felt relief.     
 I didn't have to keep checking my phone, wondering if it was gonna be the hospital saying that he hurt someone or himself, and that relief...     
 uh, just makes me feel worse.     
 I have so many feelings that I haven't processed because I am...     
 [SIGHS]     
 ...too ashamed to admit that I have them.     
 And that is complicated bereavement.

 Okay, what happened? Where'd you go?     
 [SIGHING] Uh, I don't know.     
 Every day since law school, I've been working so hard to make partner, and now it's on my doorstep.     
 How do I take it, knowing it'll pull me away from Theo even more?     
 You know what I would do?     
 Trust your gut.     
 It continues to amaze me.
