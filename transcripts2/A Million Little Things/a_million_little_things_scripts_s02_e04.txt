 A Million Little Things -   02x04   - The Perfect Storm  
 MAGGIE:  Family... what a loaded word.   
 Whatever we did, whatever happened, we also created a life.   
 - [BABY CRYING] 
-  It's the foundation for everything,   
 and, like it or not...   
 I want to come home. 
It's not John's baby.   
 ...we don't get to choose.   
 It's a lot of bags for just the weekend.   
 Mom, it's just the weekend, right?   
 I've left your father.    
 They're all we've got.   
 After Chad died, I just so wanted to believe that he was still here.    
 That's what Maggie wants.    
 So, we support them...   
 I want to take out a line of credit.    
 I want to give Andrew his money back.    
 - Let me help you, babe. 
-  ...forgive them...   
 I was able to get you a   -day extension on the foreclosure.    
 - You won't lose the house. 
-  ...and just try...   
 Maggie.    
 Did you come to Boston to see me or him?    
 ...not to hurt each other.   
 What is he doing here?    
 What makes my mom think it is okay to bring her boy toy to breakfast?    
 I mean, what is he doing hanging out with her anyway?    
 What does a   -year-old want with my mother?    
 [BAGEL CUTTER SLICES]    
 The acronym you're looking for is M-I-L...    
 You better be spelling "milk".    
 Oh, my God. That's worse.    
 Why didn't you tell Maggie I was coming?    
 Because I didn't want her to say no.    
 As soon as she gets to know you...    
 Patricia, the whole reason I agreed to be here was to help you come clean.    
 And I will.    
 Just... at the right time.    
 [BAGEL CUTTER SLAMS]    
 Which apparently is not right now.    
 And for the shrimp, I need    pounds of the  /  s, head on, tail on.    
 And how much for the Dover sole?    
 I'm sorry, I-I meant the price of the fish, not the gold-plated yacht that caught them.    
 Sign here. And here.    
 H-Hold a sec.    
 What exactly am I signing?    
 You're legally agreeing to never sing "Po-Po-Po-Po-Po-Poker Face" at karaoke ever again.    
 People loved that.    
 Sweetie, people were clapping because it was over.    
 It's your line of credit application so you can buy out Andrew.    
 Mm-hmm.

 We just need to be resourceful, especially while paying Andrew back.

 Thank you so much for doing this.    
 I know it's a sacrifice.    
 Well, it's not a sacrifice, Lady Gaga.    
 I'm betting on you.    
 Mm.    
 And my po-po-po-po...
