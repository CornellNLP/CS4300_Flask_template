 Previously on "A Million Little Things"... 
 JON:  Friendship is the person that you trust with your wallet and your wife and your kids. It's being able to have the hard conversations and be willing to listen. It's a million little things. 
 You're not gonna believe this. Jon killed himself. 
 ROME: If you hadn't called to tell me about Jon, I would be dead right now. 
 I had a mouthful of pills when I answered that phone. 
 EDDIE: Jon always said, "Everything happens for a reason." 
 I can't find a reason for this. 
 - What is he doing here? 
- Men get breast cancer, too. 
 [MOANS] 
 Obviously, my boobs are fake. 
 Obviously, I'm okay with that. 
 EDDIE: And where did you meet this one? 
    bucks says his breast cancer support group, and if I'm right, you're gross. 
 And you're    bucks richer. 
 REGINA: Gary's an amazing friend. 
 - Underneath at hot mess is... 
- A lukewarm mess? 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 GARY: When I spoke to Ashley, she said that up until then, it was a normal day at the office. 
 How does this happen? 
Why did he do this? 
 It makes no sense. 
 Jon called you at   :  . 
 I forgot my briefcase. 
Didn't you notice I left it? 
 Why is everyone an idiot? 
 GARY: You and your wife can't stand each other, but you'll never leave her. 
 I'm in love with someone. 
 We can't do this. Not now. 
 What if he knew about us?

 - Hey! 
- Hey! 
 Hi, guys. 
 Now, I know we should have called, but we didn't want you saying no. 
 I cannot eat all this food by myself. 
 This one was up all night cooking. 
 And this one was doing a midnight stroll on a hunt for bagels. 
 Found 'em. 'Cause that what you do. 
 Y-You bring bagels. 
 Oh. 
 My bubbe would be so proud of you. 
 - Would she? 
- Good news. 
 This impromptu gathering just got a whole lot better. 
 These are for you. 
 Really? Paper towels? 
 What, am I gonna show up empty-handed? 
 I found these in my car. 
 It was either this or four loose french fries. 
 Bagels. 
 Come on, man. 
Anybody can bring bagels. 
 These are perforated, okay? 
 That means you can tear off smaller sheets. 
 Are you really explaining how paper towels work to an adult? 
 Maybe. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Did I know you were gonna be here? 
 Uh, Delilah called me right after you left. 
 I didn't want her to be alone. 
 I was gonna text you, but I was worried about seeming stalker-y. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Yeah. I see irony. 
 Oh, that's right, you two know each other. 
 - Kind of. 
- Oh, we're still doing this bit? 
 - [CLEARS THROAT] 
- [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 That must be Ed. Saved by the bell, thank you. 
 No, no, I'll go get Eddie. Thank you. 
 You just stay here and get to know Maggie. 
 You're gonna love her. 
 - She's a psychologist. 
- Psychologist. 
 It's a good bit. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 - Listen. 
- Eddie. 
 - Look, I am sorry about last night... 
- Eddie... 
 - I know you don't want to see me here... 
- I know it's tough. 
 ...but I wanted to show up 'cause everybody's here. 
 Eddie, he found your necklace. 
 It was in his nightstand. 
 Jon knew. 
 - We need to tell him. 
- I know. 
 I know. 
 Wait... Just because my necklace was in his nightstand that doesn't mean Jon knew about us. 
 Then why wouldn't he give it back to you? 
 - Hey. 
- Look who's here! 
 Ashley. 
 Um, I got coffee before work. 
 I hadn't been since Jon died.

 The barista made my usual order. 
 I just didn't know what to do with his. 
 It felt weird throwing it out.

 Dude 
 Not here. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Gina doesn't know? I haven't told her yet. 
 You didn't tell Maggie, did you? 
 Of course not. 
 Well, you obviously haven't asked anything about her life, so I figured you had to fill the conversation somehow. 
 Stop covering with jokes. 
 That's literally all you ever do. 
 Look, dude, I know that I told you that stuff, but you cannot treat me... 
 Like what? Hmm? 
 Like someone who told us last night over a hot dog that you tried to kill yourself? 
 If you don't find someone to talk to about this by the end of the day, I will tell Gina myself. 
 Tell me what? 
 That I got to do the re-shoots for that commercial this afternoon, but you already know that. 
 Oh, you're a commercial director? 
 Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. 
 You're saying it's possible for one person to not know another person's occupation? 
 The difference is you've had s*x with her. 
 That, I do know. I don't mind this bit. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 All right, talk to me, come on. 
 How's school? 
 I don't love it, I don't hate it. 
 How's the insurance business? 
 Oh, I do hate it. 
 But it's a paycheck and it allows me to drive a fun car that grownups can barely fit in. 
 Anybody at school that you like? 
 You mean  like  like? 
 Who are you talking to? 
It's Uncle Gary, okay? 
 Of course I mean  like  like. 
I'm the king of the  like  like. 
 - There is this one person. 
- Give it to me. 
 Sweetie, you didn't tell me that. 
 Who is she? 
 Just this new kid at school. 
 - Ella. 
- Ella. 
 I need more juice. 
 Hey, everybody. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you all for being here. 
 Anything for you, of course. 
 Just Sophie, Danny, and I, we couldn't, uh... 
 Wait, where is Soph? 
 I don't think she's come down yet. 
 Danny, sweetie, you know where your sister is? 
 I think she's upset. 
 About this. 
 Danny, be my eyes. What is that? 
 The father/daughter dance recital. 
 That's, uh, it's the daddy/daughter recital, and it's tonight, and I forgot. 
 Sophie. 
 [CLEAR THROAT] All right, huddle up. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 You heard that. 
 Which means we got to do something for Soph. 
 We got to do what men do. 
 - We got to deflect. 
- Absolutely. 
 - That's right. 
- Yeah, what can we do to distract her? 
 We got it. What could we, uh... Karaoke? 
 I get it. I bought you one crappy Christmas gift. 
 The point is that we have to be there for her in the same way Jon would be had it been one of us. 
 Between the three of us, we should be able to cover, what, half the stuff that Jon used to do? 
 So, if we take my brains, your good looks, my sense of humor, that's a pretty killer combination. 
 It's like a great band. 
 Band of Dads. 
 Band of Dads! 
 I just said that. 
 He did just say that. 
 DELILAH: Sweetie. 
 It's okay. 
 No one expects you to do the recital. 
 I'll call Miss Jenny and tell her that you... 
 "Dixons don't quit," Mom. 
 Remember? 
 Soph? 
 Can I interest you in a cream cheese ball? 
 I'm lactose intolerant. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Not a word, Gina. Not a word from you. 
 - Sweetie, this is different. 
- But I don't want it to be. 
 I don't want all the kids at school treating me like I'm the girl whose dad killed himself. 
 [SIGHS] See? 
 This. This is exactly what I don't want. 
 Okay, last time, you... You can choose your own size. 
 So, if you have a minor spill...

 Does that mean you're gonna try to make me drink beer with you again? 
 No. 
 Maybe.

 I've never changed your diaper or anything, 'cause that's gross, but if you ever want to tell me that Ella's a boy, I'm glad to hear that, all right?

 Apparently, he's... he's been hiding behind a fake smile just like me. 
 And I've been looking for any way that we might be different, and... 
 I can't find it. 
 Listen to me. I cannot be your therapist. 
 I'm gonna refer you to my colleague, Dr. David Heller. 
 He is excellent. 
 And you need to call him. 
 All right? 
 But as a friend, I will say this. 
 There is one way that you and Jon differ. 
 You picked up the phone. 
 You took Gary's call. 
 You made the decision to live. 
 [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] 
 Does she know? 
 Not yet. 
 But you told the guys? 
 I'm sorry. With the new restaurant and everything, she's going through a lot. Just give me a second. 
 Hey, babe. Is everything okay? 
 Oh, I didn't realize how late it was. 
 I'm still at the commercial shoot. 
 Oh, no, I'm gonna quickly go home, change my clothes, and I will meet you at the recital. 
 Love you, too. 
 - You still need a ride? 
- Yeah. 
 Um, but before we go... in every relationship, there's a flower and a gardener. 
 And it sounds to me like you've been the gardener for a long time. 
 But you need to tell Regina. 
 You... you got to be the flower for a while. 
 [CHUCKLES] You're very good at your job. 
 Still can't be your therapist. 
 Yeah, right, because of the rug-burn s*x you had with Gary, right? 
- Yes! 
 I get that. 
 ♪ 
 DELILAH: Yeah. How many seats do we need? 
 All of them. Maggie said she was coming. 
 Rome said he was on his way. 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 - Is that Ella? 
- No! 
 That's Ella. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 [LAUGHS]  Bueno. 
 - Hi. Sorry we're late. 
- Yeah. 
 Well, you know, she was late, I was late. 
 I guess, so, we're late together. 
 So, what I'm hearing is you're not on time? 
 No, 'cause we're late. 
 - Hi. 
- Hi. 
 I called you. You didn't pick up. 
 Sorry, I was busy, man. 
 Oh, no, no, that's not fair. 
 I call you, you don't pick up, I worry now. 
 My God, I just became my mother. 
 For your information, Mama Mendez, I was in my first therapy session. 
 You already found a therapist? 
 That's great. 
 Who is he? 
 Uh, this guy, um, uh, Dr. Heller. 
 Sure. 
 I'm gonna get some footage of Sophie and Frankenstein. 
 Technically, he's Frankenstein's monster. 
 - [SIGHS] 
- Oh, hey, stranger. 
 Doctor. 
 How was your day? 
 It was... good. 
 'Cause if I'm not mistaken, I saw you hugging a homeless man outside your apartment. 
 Well, some people give money, I give hugs. 
 - You can't drink hugs. 
- No, you cannot. 
 At the risk of sounding like... any number of the women that I have disappointed, who was that, exactly? 
 Actually, I didn't ask that. 
 Forget I asked that. 
 Now I'm asking. Who was that? 
 It's just... someone from my past. 
 You do  like  like her. 
 And that's your second ginger ale. 
 Are we keeping secrets or not?
