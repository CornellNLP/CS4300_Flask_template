 GARY: When someone you love goes too soon...   
 Jon, you say everything happens for a reason.   
 ...you can't help but wonder why.   
 [VOICE BREAKING] I can't find a reason for this.   
 [ECHOING] No!   
 Tell me one good thing that's happened because of this. One.   
 But then, in a weird way...   
 Sometimes, I feel so hopeless!   
 ...their death reminds you to celebrate life...    
 I don't want to not live because I'm afraid of not living.    
 ...even a new life...    
 - This is our baby. 
- Stop.    
 ...even when it's hard.    
 I think we should get a divorce.    
 So you keep pushing forward...    
 Is this based on your life?    
 I've had days like that.    
 ...to find hope...    
 I'm looking for Barbara Morgan.
