 You had s*x with Ashley?   
 Are you at all worried about this?   
 He's talking about Maggie.   
 She ended things with me.   
 She's not just your ex. Maggie's our friend.   
 The guys needed to know if you were up for touring.   
 You're standing a couple feet from the bottle   
 and you're not drinking it.    
 This could be huge.    
 ROME: I don't know how you do it all, babe.    
 Launching a new restaurant, taking care of the house...    
 And reminding you to take your meds.    
 Which I already did.    
 No, you didn't.    
 No, I didn't. Damn it.    
 I just want what's best for you.    
 Pretending you're not the father,    
 I know it's unbearable.    
 It's got to be the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.    
 After all the business    
 that Jon has thrown your way,    
 you're just gonna, what,    
 sit there and screw his family over?    
 GARY: You, Jon...    
 You went through the whole thing with me,    
 and you convinced me to live,    
 and then you left me.    
 EDDIE: Gary, no!

 Well, you're under the mistletoe.     
 You got to kiss.

 whose seeds are spread through bird feces.     
 So you'll understand if I'm not inclined to pucker up.     
 Uh, and I decline the kiss for a host of other reasons.
