 There's something I need to tell you.   
 It's not Jon's baby.   
 EDDIE: How do you come back from a lie...   
 I'm looking for Barbara Morgan.   
 I think she may know things about my husband.   
 ...once it's out there?   
 BARBARA: Jon was supposed to be on that flight.   
 He wouldn't let himself move past it.   
 I had to. I was pregnant.    
 It keeps growing...    
 Your son doesn't know what happened to his father.    
 ...until...    
 Mitch is his father.    
 ...it consumes you.    
 I'm not calling for help. 
I'm calling to volunteer.    
 So, you have to face it...    
 REGINA: Everywhere I turn, there's Andrew stepping on my toes.    
 He's the reason we're open in the first place.    
 ...hope for the best...    
 Maggie, you're in remission.    
 Oh, thank God.    
 [LAUGHS]    
 ...and trust...    
 Don't be so hard on your mom.    
 We all cope in different ways.    
 ...that it's not too late.
