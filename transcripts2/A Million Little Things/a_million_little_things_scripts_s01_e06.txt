 Previously on "A Million Little Things"...   
 I have been thinking about maybe performing again, getting back on stage.   
 I thought you gave that all up, man.   
 Yeah, so did I.   
 GARY: I will do whatever it takes to get you well,and we will fight this thing together.   
 I'm done with treatment.   
 I'm not gonna fight my cancer.    
 ROME: If you hadn't called to tell me about Jon, I would be dead right now.    
 I quit my job to pursue my dreams.    
 I thought I'd feel different. I don't.    
 DR. HELLER: I am gonna start you on an antidepressant.    
 I can't be with you anymore.    
 EDDIE: I don't know what I'm gonna do.    
 My couch is your couch.    
 As long as you need it.    
 ROME: I know that you're pregnant.    
 I saw the stick.    
 It's Delilah's.    
 ♪    
 ROME: Normally, I look forward to game night, but I don't know.    
 Tonight feels like the finals.    
 The biggest game is going to be not letting anyone else know that Delilah is pregnant.    
 We are in the Thunderdome here.    
 Babe, I need you...    
 - No. 
- ...to lie.    
 - No. 
- Rome.    
 - No! 
- Rome.    
 - No! No. 
- Look at me.    
 You're a writer.    
 Make up a story.    
 I need context, okay?    
 I need... I need motivation.    
 I need backstory.    
 I believe there is sufficient backstory here.    
 Wait. [SIGHS]    
 Rome, I'm serious.    
 Not a word of this to the guys or anyone.    
 I still can't believe you didn't ask Delilah who the father was.    
 Montel Williams made an entire career off of that question.    
 How could you not ask?

 Who comes to game night early?    
 People who do not know Delilah is pregnant.    
 Okay, o-okay, can...   
 Can we just go over what everyone knows?    
 So, Eddie and Gary think that you're pregnant.    
 [SIGHING] Oh, thank you, Big Man.    
 Okay, and Delilah... 
What does Delilah know?    
 Delilah knows she's pregnant.    
 - She is the one who is pregnant. 
- Right.    
 So... So, what about Maggie?    
 - What does Maggie know? 
- Nothing.    
 God, I wish I was Maggie.    
 - Hi! 
- Hey!    
 Hey, I know we're early. I'm sorry.    
 But I love a good game night. I love it.    
 - ROME: How about I get that jacket from you? 
- Oh, thank you.    
 A little heads-up...    
 This one is super competitive.    
 Uh, a little heads-up... 
This one is going down.    
 A little heads-up...    
 This is what the entire car ride over was like.    
 GARY: Oh, really, 'cause if memory serves, the whole car ride over was you freaking out about your gig.

 No, Storm is not a name.

 Cory, talk about a blast from the past, right?    
 Yeah, my client's headlining tonight.    
 Damn!    
 I remember when you flamed out at the "Sundown" tour.    
 That performance in Pittsburgh, whoo!    
 Legendary.     
 They ever let you back in a Radisson after that?     
 Ha!     
 MAGGIE: Aah, oh, no!     
 That's the third time that's happened.     
 Hey, why don't you put it in my bag?     
 Don't you want to feel the sun on your face?     
 The rule is if I'm in the sun, I have to either be in my hat or wearing SPF   .     
 All right, you know,some rules are made to be broken.     
 No, they're not.     
 Then they wouldn't be rules.

 [DUCKS QUACKING]     
 Hey!     
 Look! Ooh!     
 You know what?     
 Let's go feed the ducks.     
 Are you kidding me?     
 You don't like ducks?     
 Every kid likes ducks.     
 You're not supposed to feed them.     
 Bread makes them gain weight, and if they gain weight, they get this thing called "angel wing."     
 Then they can't fly.     
 I can't feed the ducks because I like the ducks.     
 Okay. All right.     
 You make a solid argument for the ducks, but surely you can take off the hat just for, like,    minutes.     
 No?     
 All right.
