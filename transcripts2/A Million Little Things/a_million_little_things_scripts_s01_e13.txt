 GARY: I will do whatever it takes to get you well, and we will fight this thing together.   
 I didn't make partner.   
 Then why are you smiling?

 You've got to admit, there's some advantages to me being off my meds.    
 The commercial loan that Jon took out was for some properties he was underwater on.    
 How much does he owe?    
 $   million. And it's what you owe.    
 GARY: We've got to be missing something.    
 The Jon I knew would not have left his family like this... no way.    
 KATHERINE: Someone's been making payments to Jon's loan since he died.    
 - Ashley? 
- I'm looking at the account right now.    
 - Rutledge Trust. 
- GARY: Rutledge...    
 It was a term we came up with as a shorthand.    
 - For what? 
- Take care of my family.    
 Please don't tell anybody about this place.    
 Your secret's safe with me.

 Morning.

 Everything okay?    
 Uh, yeah, it's just Theo.    
 - Is he hurt? 
- No.    
 He just hasn't been acting like himself lately.    
 I think something's going on at school.    
 Thanks.    
 Mrs. Cleary said that he hasn't been hanging out with his friends.    
 You know, he's been going to the library during recess.    
 - Well, you know... 
- Even more than usual.    
 Have you asked him about it?    
 Yeah, he's not really talking.    
 I think he needs some Dad Time.    
 Well, we're coming through today, on our way to Connecticut.    
 If you are up for it, maybe you can meet up with us and Theo can spend the night with me.    
 A  -year-old on a tour bus?    
 I'll talk to the guys.    
 I promise they'll be on their best behavior.    
 What's up, assbags?!    
 Did he just just say...    
 I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll talk to the guys.    
 ASHLEY: This is Ashley. Please leave a message.

 Katherine said you've been making payments on Jon's business loans?    
 - I have to know what's going on. Please.

 Okay, um, there has been an eight percent reduction in the tumor.     
 So the chemo seems to be effective.     
 If we can get it to shrink by at least another eight percent, then we can remove it without affecting the healthy tissue.     
 - [SIGHS] 
- Oh, my God. Hot damn, huh?     
 We're not out of the woods yet.     
 We need to continue the chemo so the tumor is small enough that surgery is an option.

- Where's Gina?     
 She went to pick up our wedding album.     
 Wedding alb... Haven't you guys been married     
 - for like four years? 
- And yet I feel like I've been hearing about this album for    years.     
 Negative Gary's back, you guys.     
 - Welcome back. 
- Aw.     
 - Wasn't gone for long. 
- Yeah.     
 So an offer? I-I... I don't understand.     
 Apparently, when Jon first bought the buildings, there were plans for a subway stop to go in.     
 And if it had, the properties would have doubled in value.     
 That's why he overpaid for them.     
 He would have made a fortune.     
 But now, the subway is back on the table, and there's an investor who believes the vote will pass.     
 We got an e-mail saying he's gonna make an offer.     
 Well, that's great. Right? We don't you sound more excited?     
 Because the subway stop is not a sure thing, so the offer won't be huge.     
 Most likely, you'll still be upside down.     
 - By how much? 
- I'm not sure.     
 I want us to get on the phone with their lawyer as soon as possible.     
 We have to move quickly because the subway vote is tomorrow at  :  , and if it doesn't pass, they'll pull the offer.

 There is a problem with the album.     
 He wants to talk to "the man."

 Here's "the man."

 How can I illuminate the situation today

 No, it is your ears that need to listen to me, Rome, because...     
 Berge, stop talking.     
 I cannot... I cannot stop talking

 No, what you see is the picture of the only person in the world

- Ooh.     
 So whatever Gina wants to happen is what's going to happen.     
 If Gina says, "Give Berge an extra hundred dollars," you walk away with a Benjamin.
