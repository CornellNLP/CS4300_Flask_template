 I'm sorry, Barbara.   
 You deserve the whole story.   
 Jon, you say everything happens for a reason.

 JON: You deserve the truth.   
 That was beautiful.   
 You once told me that we can't change the past.   
 We can only change our reaction to it.    
 Because even if the past is painful, you never know when it'll lead to something wonderful.    
 But, Barbara, after what happened all those years ago, I think I get it now.    
 So if I were to ask myself today if I'd change the past or my reaction to it...
