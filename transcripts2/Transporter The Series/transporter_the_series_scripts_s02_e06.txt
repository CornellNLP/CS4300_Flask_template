 [Sound of crowd screaming madly] 
 [Sound of fans yelling their appreciation] 
 [Sounds of paparazzi screaming, cameras clicking] 
 [Sound of SUV accelerating gradually] 
 [Sound of motorcycles giving chase] Well, that worked just like you said it would but... I look like a hobo in these clothes. You look exactly how I want you to look. Invisible. I didn't get where I am by being invisible. The hat is gross! That's not a good idea. [Sound of motorcycles gunning motors] Oh sh1t! [Sound of motorcycles getting closer] Let's loose these assholes. [Sound of screeching tires] [Sound of motorcyles chasing Frank's car] Okay, so lose them, but don't drive dangerously. As you wish. [Sound of Frank's car accelerating] [Sound of high-speed chase through city streets] [Sound of squealing brakes, screeching tires] [Sound of motorcycle skidding, crashing to ground] You call that safe? There's still two behind us. [Sound of speeding car and motorcycles in hot pursuit] [Sound of screeching tires on cobblestone] [Sound of car tires burning rubber] [Sound of motorcycles speeding past] Not bad. That's a relief. [Sound of trolley passing] [Sound of motorcyclist gunning his engine] Persistent buggers, aren't they? What? Where did he come from? He's not giving up. Frank, I think it's him. I really think it is. Can we just get the f*ck away please? It'll be my pleasure. [Sound of Frank gunning his motor] [Sound of motorcyclist gunning his motor] ♪ [Thrilling music comes up] [Screeching tires] Oh my God! He's good, whoever he is. [Sound of trolley passing] [Sound of screeching tires, racing motors] [Sound of tires squealing against cobblestone] [Sound of automatic weapon being fired wildly] Stay down. Keep your head down. [Sound of more shots ringing out] [Sound of approaching locomotive] Frank? ♪ [Mysterious music comes up] You got this, right? Frank? What are you doing? Hold tight. ♪ [Music builds stronger] [Sound of Frank's tires screaming] [Sound of claxton on locomotive] [Sound of train cars locking] [Sound of motorcycle coming to halt] [Sound of motorcyclist banging on handbars] This is CCTV of the man who chased you in Rome last week. It's the same guy, isn't it? We can't be sure. He's got that face plate on. Gimme a f*cking break, Jerome. You think I got two psycho assassins chasing me? One driver, same pursuit strategy. Except that last week my chauffeur crashed. At least you got me away from the son-of-a-bitch. And you have no idea who this guy is? None. There's always wackos and haters online, but this guy, it's like he just came out of nowhere. Are you telling me the cops can't do anything about this? Which cops? You're on tour, Baby. A different country almost every day. You're vulnerable, and who ever this man is, he knows it. You've just got two shows left. Mr. Martin will keep you safe. Won't you, Mr. Martin? I'll do my best. This guy did make one mistake. Only a single frame, but it shows his face. Is that him? Do you recognize him? No, I don't! Can't the police use that to ID this guy? They're doing everything they can. What the f*ck is... .? What the..? What the... ? You might wanna tell those guys to get after that waiter. Hey! You heard the man!

Nursing their wounds, they'll be alright. And the waiter? I left him with hotel security, they're calling the police. He has a false ID and claims he doesn't speak English. So he's not gonna tell us anything? I don't expect he will. A dead bird's a pretty specific message. Well, I hope you figure it out because I don't have a clue. You need to be in Berlin in a few hours. Right... Give me a sec, I'll get ready. ♪ [Music with hard beat comes up] [Sounds of busy highway] Donna Summer. You say something? Not a word. Frank Martin. Miss McIntyre. You did not attend my concert last night. Or the night before. I don't believe I was ever invited. So... It's not because you don't wanna hear me sing? Why would that be? Because you don't seem that interested. I hear you're very talented. Oh, you hear right. ♪ [Mysterious music comes up] [Noisy fans screaming on street] [Sound of fans chanting "Ferrara" behind security] [Fans screaming their appreciation] I'll be waiting here after the show. You really aren't coming inside? You don't need me in there. But I want you there. You have your bodyguards, venue security... My music, wise-ass... Give it a try, you might be surprised I'm not sure you're paying me enough for that. Jerome has a couple of backstage passes. Bring Ms. Boldieu. Thank you, Mr. Martin. She's a hard lady to say no to. Mr. Knight? Miles Marcus, Rapido. Oh, Miles, great to meet you, man. Ferrara is really looking forward to this interview. Can't wait to meet her. So should I come find you after the show? Meet me right here, I'll take you right to her. Thanks, man. You got that? Yeah. ♪ [Mysterious music comes up] [Sound of chanting fans] Ferrara sold out! If you care about freedom, don't see her show tonight! Ferrara sold out! If you care about the killing of innocent people, don't see her show tonight! "Ferrara supports murder"? Yeah, they've been spreading this all over the internet. Ferrara played a birthday party for Benoit Nshombo, son of a deposed dictator. You want something? [Sound of hard body punches, journalist's head hitting wall] [Sound of closing toilet door] [Audience roaring] Thank you! Thank you so much! ♪ [Sound of band striking up, audience cheering wildly] I think you'll know this one. [Pop song with hard beat comes up, audience clapping along] ♪ You know you can't find it ♪

♪ ... Killing me softly with his love, ♪ 
♪ Killing me softly ♪

She needs to go in the hospital. What is it? She's been poisoned. [Sound of Frank's car accelerating rapidly] Hang in there, Ferrara. Hang in there. Hang in there, Baby. It's okay, Baby, it's okay. Hang in there, Ferrara. [Sound of Frank's screeching tires braking abruptly] Ferrara, you're in the hospital, it's okay, it's okay. Are you the doctor? Yeah. You need to get this analyzed. What is it? I think she was poisoned. I'll get it to toxicology. ♪ [Surreal music comes back up] [City sounds, fans milling in front of hospital] [Sound of Cat's car pulling in] Okay. Where did you get this number? Yeah, I got no comment to make, bye. News got out quickly. Welcome to our world. How's she doing? Not great. But they identified the poison, and they found an antidote. What did he poison her with? Some kind of rare neurotoxin. They thought it might be snake venom. Snake venom? Hey, you got anything on our ghost rider? Yeah, a good look at his face this time. Jean-Marc Vincent. Former French Special Forces, turned mercenary. So he's a professional, that's what you thought. And that waiter... He's Arnaud Akinoué. Another mercenary... from the Democratic Republic of Central Africa. Where those protestors are from? You gotta be kidding me, right? You know that dead bird he left? That's a purple-crested queen parrot. Let me guess, found in Central Africa? Exactly. So someone in that group could be behind all this? That's what it looks like. So you're telling me this is all because Ferrara played a concert for that dictator's son? We don't know that yet, but that's what I'm trying to find out. Mr. Martin? Mr. Knight? You can see her now. How you feeling, Baby-girl? Like an elephant stepped on my head. I hear you saved my life. Ms. Boldieu thinks the attacker is connected to the protestors. Protesters? Against that concert? So we just gotta get you back home. What do you mean back home? I've got a tour to finish. You're lucky to be alive. The plane is taking us straight to New York. No, like hell it is. Honey, the tour is finished. Not until I say it is. Ferrara, you nearly f*cking died! Look, I got one more date in Amsterdam. You cancel it, you're fired. The show must go on. You're wasting your time, she's already split. Yes... I got it. [Sound of motorcycle accelerating rapidly] Can I sit up now? Coast is clear. Ah... We did it! Are you feeling okay? Still pretty wobbly. Let me know if you need to stop. How much longer until we get to Amsterdam? We're not going to Amsterdam. Not tonight. Why not? It's better to keep a low profile. Okay. "Low profile," whatever the f*ck that means. So, I guess it's just you now... standing between me and Armageddon. I guess so. 
 
 [Sound of Frank's car leaving highway for country road] Got any tunes? Lynyrd Skynyrd... Right. Good song. ♪ ["Free Bird" comes up] ♪ If I leave here tomorrow, ♪ 
♪ Would you still remember me? ♪ So... Do you like my music? I like all kinds of music. Yeah... I practically had to force you to go to my concert. I don't go to concerts. Seriously? Not when I'm working. Sure. Just doing your job. ♪ [Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird" comes up again] So this is what you meant by low profile? It's a good place to rest. You sure we're safe here? You left your mobile with Jerome? That's what you told me to do. Then, we're safe here, unless we were followed... And we weren't. Well, I usually take an entire floor of a 5-star hotel. You called about the room? Yeah, that's us. Please, come in. They don't recognize me. Is that good or bad? I'm not sure. Welcome. Thank you. This is beautiful. Are you hungry? Would you like some food? No, thank you. Assorted meat? No, thank you. Thank you. You are a very nice couple. Hello. Hello. We're not a couple, actually. I'm sorry. Forgive me, please. No, no, it's okay, it's an easy mistake. Would you... would you mind sign this? Oh of course... Sure. ... Berlin. Hey there... Is that your favourite car? Yes. Can I play with it? Can I see? You want it back? Theo, it's bedtime. Come. We can never get him to sleep. Can you sing to me? Of course I can. I'd love to. ♪ [Mysterious music comes up] I'm a philanthropist, facing so many deserving causes. Which do I help first? Maybe... you can help... both at the same time? Only two? ♪ [Sound of club's pop music] See who else you can find? What was that about? So, how do we celebrate your success? Want some champagne? No. I'm sorry, Mr. Nshombo. I thought you got to her. I did. But the transporter... he saved her. What transporter? His name is Frank Martin. He saved her life. Then take care of him too. I would... If I knew where to find them. You're going to find them both, do you understand me? Yes, Benoit, yes. Find them! Three? [Sound of women's laughter] [Sound of owl calling in distance] ♪ Swing low, ♪ 
♪ sweet chariot, ♪

♪ Swing low, ♪ 
♪ sweet chariot, ♪ 
♪ Coming for to carry me home. ♪ That was nice. I didn't know I had an audience. I'm gonna turn in, I'm beat. Good night. Good night. ♪ [Orchestral music comes up] [Sounds of city and traffic come up] Claudine Kisimba? Yes. I'm Caterina Boldieu. You were one of the protestors at Ferrara's concert last night. Are you a reporter? No, I'm not a reporter. You know, someone tried to kill Ferrara yesterday? You think it's us? Your group has been on every stop in her tour. And that makes us what? Terrorists? Your leaflet says Ferrara supports murder. Pretty extreme language. You know who Benoit Nshombo is? The son of a deposed dictator. Guilty of genocide, just like his father. He's Harvard-educated, lives in Europe, donates money to charity. A wolf in sheep's clothing. He's never been charged with a crime. Because he's ordered thousands of deaths, but the bodies always disappear. No one can prove it. And Ferrara, she sings at his party makes this monster look good. Do you know who this guy is? Jean-Marc Vincent. Did you hire him? What? Of course not. He's one of Nshombo's assassins. [Sound of soft knocking on door] Yeah? Hey. Hey. I was just wondering if you... You want a drink? Yeah, why not. It would be nice. I can't sleep and all that. [Sound of ice cubes in glass] Oh yeah? You want me to sing to you? Yes, I would love that. You haven't heard my singing. ♪ [Romantic music comes up] [Sound of mobile phone ringing] Yeah? Frank. I know who Vincent's working for. It's Benoit Nshombo. That dictator. Are you certain? I talked to Interpol. He's a suspect in several murders, and they all lead back to Nshombo. Vincent's his all-purpose hit man. I'm trying to locate him now. Okay, thanks. It wasn't the protesters that hired Vincent to kill you. It was Nshombo. What? Why would he want you dead? I don't know. If you know something, now's the time. Don't lie to me. I don't f*cking know. I played his birthday party. We got flown to some weird villa in Miami... I did my set... I went back to my room to get changed, he followed me, barged his way in, said he wanted his "million's dollars worth," and then I managed to get the f*ck out. That's when the protests start. Yeah, and I gave every cent to charity when I found out who the f*ck he was. Has he tried to contact you since? No, not that I know of. I don't understand why he'd want to kill me. Well, obviously he's not a guy that takes rejection well. [Sound of approaching SUV] [Sound of SUV door closing, dogs barging] What? What is it? What is it? The dog... They're here. What? How do you know? Get dressed. Come with me. Wake up! Turn the light off. Come with me now. You brought your cell phone, didn't you? I switched it off! You can still trace the signal, even if it's off. Stay there for a minute. ♪ [Suspenseful music comes up] You have a basement, somewhere you can hide? Basement, no, no basement. We can hide in the church. Where is it? Out the back. Okay, make your way there. Stay hidden. Don't move until I come for you. Okay. I'll find you. [Sound of Frank cocking rifle, hurried footsteps] ♪ [Suspenseful music becomes more insistent] [Sound of horses braying] He's out there! Go, go, go!

She's gone! ♪ [Hard-driving music comes up] Cat, what've you got? Nshombo's property outside Hanover... I don't know if Vincent took her there but... Send me the co-ordinates. Sending it to you now. I'll call the police. [Sound of Frank's car accelerating] ♪ [Suspenseful music comes up] [Sound of Frank's car braking] [Sound of pigeons fluttering away] Frank! They're here. Yeah, I know. Are you hurt? Good morning, Mr. Martin. I don't carry a weapon. You come here to die, Mr. Martin? No, to see you in prison. Then you'll be very disappointed like so many others have been. Kidnapping, attempted murder... You add murder to that list, you'll spend the rest of your life behind bars. If they find her body. Or yours. Which they won't. They never do. Fluoro-sulphuric acid. I find it rather useful. As you can imagine. No, please don't do this. Please! You do not address me! You disrespected me! No, please! Wait, wait! Wait! I'll do anything you want! I'll do anything. So you'll prostitute yourself to save your lover? Come on then, let's see how much of a slut you really are. No! Frank! [Sound of Frank's hard blows to assassin] [Sounds of terrible struggle] [Sound of blow to Nshombo's head] [Sounds of continuing struggle] [Sound of powerful kick] [Sound of hard body punches] [Sound of Frank and assassin falling through trap door] [Sound of Ferrara's panicky footsteps] [Sound of Frank dunking assassin's head] [Sound of assassin screaming underwater] I'm not who you think I am. I'm going to cut your ugly, fat face! Frank... You wouldn't dare. [Sound of police cars arriving] [Sound of Frank firing pistol at Nshombo's leg] ♪ [Grand music comes up] [Sound of Frank's car approaching] [Sound of fans yelling for Ferrara] So... Back to the circus, and no one will ever know. Thanks to you. All in a day's work. I could do low profile. I could be your Miss Moneypenny. Yes, you could. But you shouldn't. Well, you will do me a favour then. Stay for the first song. [Sound of audience cheering enthusiastically] ♪ If I leave you tomorrow, ♪ 
♪ Would you still remember me? ♪ 
♪ For I must be travelling on now, ♪ 
♪ Too many places I've got to see. ♪ 
♪ [Solo piano comes up] ♪ But if I stayed here with you, boy, ♪ 
♪ Things could never be the same, ♪ 
♪ For I'm as free as a bird, ♪ 
♪ And this bird you can not change, ♪ 
♪ No, this bird you can not change, ♪ 
♪ Oh Lord. ♪ 
♪ I can't change... ♪
