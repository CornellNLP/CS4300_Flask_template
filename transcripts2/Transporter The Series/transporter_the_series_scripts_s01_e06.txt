 [phone ringing] 
 I'm travelling. 
 [i]The car check out? Tested pretty well, yeah. Where am I going? Tungsten Security. Your SAT NAV should already be programmed. There's no drop-off. It will be in the package. Copy that. What's Tungsten Security? Armoured transport. They're one of the best-known security outfits in the world. So why are they calling us? Discretion, Frank. Why they always call us. All right. Well, let's get this done. The package is in a vault. And I get it how? You're going to sign for it. Access codes are in the passport. Pickup's at 17: 28. Tungsten closes at 17: 30. Don't be early. That's a two-minute window, Carla. You get a reputation for punctuality, people expect you to be on time. [sportscaster]: Getting underway in just about an hour, the playoff debut of the Ontario Diamonds. Ian O'Sullivan, businessman of the year three years running, has boldly predicted that the all-star outfit, which now features his eldest son Marcus at centre, will become Canada's pre-eminent professional hockey team... You'd better believe it. ...rivalling the Maple Leafs. It's really an incredible story, Jeff, you know, long time... [TV muted] Heather, another drink? Coming. Man : Who does she remind you of? Man : So, are we gonna get some action...? [vibrating] [girl moaning in video] Yeah? It's O'Sullivan. I know. What's up? Checking in. Nothing has changed, man. Be patient. I will call you  when the courier arrives. Turn that f*cking sh1t down. We have to leave in about 20 minutes. I know. Be patient, for Christ's sake. This tastes like crap. It's the Glantarnich. I know what it is. I pay $350 a bottle for it. There's too much ice. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. What? You've been waiting for tonight for weeks. And Marcus can't wait to have you at a game. What's that supposed to mean? You've missed a lot of games this year. I mean he'll be happy that you'll be there. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. The drink's fine. Lot on my mind. You know what would make me feel better? [He chuckles.] Ian... I'm ready to go. Come on, my... my hair. I will not touch your hair. Come on, sweetheart. I like the look of those diamonds. Do you like them? Come on, sweetheart, I've got a hockey game to go to. Stan Rickel? Really? Five, three, seven, one, nine. Let him in. And at centre for the Diamonds is Marc O'Sullivan, the young phenom, and he is carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders. Do you think his father bought him that jersey? All I know is he's playing... No, that never happens, eh? Yeah, he's bought and paid for. Stan Rickel. Welcome to Tungsten Security, Mr. Rickel. I like her tits. But she can't dance. What's dancing about, anyway? Yeah. Tits. Exactly. [vibrating] Right on. Let's go. [buzzer] He's making his teammates... You wanna turn that down? ...making the hits, and that's all I care about. Harry, you check the secondary short like I asked? It's done, boss. It's not in the log. I will fill it in after shift. Wouldn't want anything to happen to you that doesn't make the log, Harry. I saw that, Harry. Write it up. And I won't say anything about the unauthorized use of company equipment to watch the hockey game. Why would they let this guy in without a full scan? [typing] After hours... 17: 31. So this... Stan Rickel isn't really here? Oh, he's here all right. Sneddon's with him. It's OK, Double-D. [beeps] [truck beeping] Thank you very much. Mr. Mayor, glad you could make it tonight. Ian, all the favours I do you, I had to let you do one for me. Ha. I heard that f*cking Sean Gallagher kid who used to work for you is writing an article for the Toronto Star. You want to watch the f*ck out. [cell phone ringing] We're here to see a star in the making... my nephew Marcus,  who we're all rooting for tonight. [ringing on other end] Yeah. We're on. Call me when it's done. What about the courier? Kill him. Just want to be sure. It's hard to keep up with all the people you want dead. Let's go! Open the door. Those the getaways? Yes. Thanks for coming, Stan. And miss my sister's son's big night? That asshole treating you all right? Everything's fine. [cheering horn] What do you want now? I thought you might like a drink. Get me a scotch. And I don't want you drinking tonight. I'd like to propose a toast.   To the Diamonds, but more importantly to the city of Toronto and its people. There's no place I'd rather call home. [others]: Hear, hear! Cheers! [applause] You're to take the package and leave immediately. You have 30 seconds till that door closes. There's no destination. That's not my business. [phone beeping] No reception. Anyway, you're out of time. [hockey game playing] You know, I was gonna take my nephew. Yeah, take my nephew to this game. I had tickets and everything. Watch these turkeys get their ass beat? You're better off working. What do you think, Double-D? Diamonds got a chance? I think you should stop calling me Double-D. Why? It suits you. Darcy Daniels. It suits you better, Lester. Your tits are bigger than mine. Can you still make face-off? Go on, get. Really? Yeah, yeah, it's quiet. Me and Lester got it covered. [buzzer] [ref blowing whistle] Have a good one, buddy.  I'm off to the hockey game. The puck is about to drop for the first period. It should be quite a game. And... We lost our feed. It'll come back. It always does. Just give it a minute. Commentator : Oh, what a hit! Hey. Something's wrong. Hey! Ah! Ugh! Oof! [buzzer] Gentlemen, this is a client. Commentator : Both teams exchanging blows. Get to the vault. Lock yourself in. But there's a time-lock. It won't open till morning. Then this'll be over. Have a nice night. Ugh! Ooh! Oh-ho! Denied! I'm gonna go check it out. Go, Diamonds! Don't move. Look, I know this looks bad. No. No, the guards aren't guards. What? When did Tungsten start hiring guys with gang tattoos, Darcy Daniels? How do you know my name? Name tag. Oh. Get on the floor! You got to be kidding me. I'm not the bad guy, OK? Think! Speaking of which... He could be with you. If he's not, which he's not, then we're both dead. And I can't take him on single-handedly... literally. Where's the key? Um... I... I must have lost it. That door's not going to hold them forever. They cut the alarm! And the phone's dead, and... You lost it? I don't know what happened! It must have shaken loose when you attacked me! When I attacked you? [gunshots] Darcy, tell me there's another way out or we're both dead. [gunfire] Lester, come in. Do you read me? We have a goddamn breach, the alarms are down, and Harry's been f*cking shot! Lester! Who's Lester? Security office. Lester! You two. Go to the security room. You're with me. Lester. Lester, come in. We're on the fourth floor, and I need help. Again, we're on the fourth floor. Darcy, is that you? Oh, God, thank God. I need you to call the police. We're on the fourth floor. We have a goddamn breach... They're on the fourth floor. Copy that. They're up three floors. What are we going to do? Well, first, let's lose these. Is there a place in the building with tools? Like a maintenance office? This is an office building, it's not a construction site. We've got shrinks, we've got plastic surgeons, we've got dentists... Dentist. Take me there. Take me to the dentist. Oh, uh, uh... could I, uh... What? I drink a lot of water. It'll be quick. Oh, no. Can you just wait here? Geez, uh, can you run the water? No. Can you sing a song? Absolutely no. Oh, no, no, no, I gotta wash. Quick. Ah! Ah! In here. Quick. Go, go. Roco. Roco! Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Which way? They headed towards dentistry. Jesus Christ! Who are those guys? And who the hell are you? Darcy, calm down. Think! Use your training... assuming you have any. It wasn't what was in the vault they were after. They were after you. Right? Yeah. Why? Because I have something that they want. Why not just give it back? It doesn't usually work that way. What is it? Doesn't work that way, either. Technically, we're not supposed to open the package. What does that even mean? These guys are trying to kill us! Just give them what they want, and let's get the hell out of here! Get the C-4. [banging on door] Driver! [banging on door] I can wait. I am a patient man. [buzzing] 
 
 Huh. We're kind of trapped in here, right? Well, you could, uh... well, yes. Was that part of the plan? The trapped part? Not so much. OK. sh1t. Um... are you looking for anything in particular? Drill bits. Drill bits, drill bits... What do they look like? They look like this? These are supposed to be diamond. [beep!] I don't think that's the ideal application. You been in this line of work long? What, dentistry? The bad-guy-fighting thing. [beep!] Ah! Ugh! You're getting good at this. Go. Get to a phone. Get out. Ah! Let her go. You guys look like you could both use a check-up. [shouts.] Commentator : Oh, he's taking a run at him now. Oops! There's a cheap shot. Nice use of the hands right there. Ahhh! Idiot! [Roco shouts.] [whistle] Commentator : No good. [alarm] [joints cracking] Score one for Darcy Daniels. Someone tripped the alarm. Let's go downstairs. [ding!] [drill buzzing] Rule number three, Frank: don't open the package. Diamond. What the f*ck has all this got to do with a raw diamond? [ding!] Harry. sh1t. You could say that. [police sirens] Throw off the cops and meet us in the garage. [police sirens] You better have made it out of here, Darcy. [alarm bell ringing] [cop]: What've we got? There's a guy on the fourth floor in a black suit. He shot the guard and a couple other people. He's still armed. [muffled shouting] He'll come for the girl. I'll take her to O'Sullivan. Get the courier before the cops do. I want the package. [alarm bell ringing] Mrs. O'Sullivan, I understand that your husband travels a lot. - Yes, he does. [cell phone ringing] I'm sorry, can you just give me a minute? Sure. What the f*ck is going on? We do not have the package. What do you mean? The courier managed to create a little mayhem. That's what I pay you for, Leon. From me you'll get a big mayhem. Just get the f*cking package. [muffled]: Let me out! [pounding inside trunk] Sorry. Where were we? Uh, Mrs. O'Sullivan was just telling me about some of your charitable work in Africa. Sierra Leone. Yes, Africa. It's one of our favourite places, isn't it, sweetheart? [phone ringing] Where have you been, Frank? The client called twice, and now I can't get him on the line. I've had my hands full, Carla. I'm not the only one after the package. Who else wants it? How would I know? They're happy enough to kill people to get it, though. So drop it off, and get the hell out of there, Frank. Well, that's the plan, Carla, but I still don't know where I'm going. The address is on the front of the package. No, it's not. [typing] There is a backup. You have to open the package. The rules, Carla, the rules. Break the rules once in a while. I break the rules at least once a week. It's a SIM card  like the ones you put in a phone. Put it in the port on the back of the dash screen  so I can access the drop-off address. Do you have the card? I do, Carla. Oh, this is just getting better and better. So, it's like that, is it? Frank? Do you hear me? Carla, I'm busy. Frank, are you OK? Toronto traffic is a bitch, Carla. OK, the card belongs to Sean Gallagher, Frank. 514 Union St. in Yorkville. Apartment number 2230. Sending coordinates. I'm on my way. There are video files stored on it. Was there anything else in the package? There was. A raw diamond. It was odd. The video files are encrypted. Well, they must be pretty important  for those guys to blow up half a building. [knocking on door] Sean Gallagher? Yes, Frank? What do we know about an Ian O'Sullivan of Toronto? Funny you should ask that, Frank. I just broke Lots of photos of a guy who is not very nice to the people he works with. Uploading photo. He's a big deal in African mining. Diamonds. Supplies equipment, according to the company. He's not a very nice man, Frank. This is what was on the SIM card? Yes. And Sean Gallagher? Used to work for O'Sullivan as a media advisor, but now he's a reporter  for the Toronto Star. WAS a reporter? What, Frank? Nothing, Carla. He was doing this story on O'Sullivan. Is there anything else? There is video as well as photos. Under the guise of industry and natural resources exploration, O'Sullivan waged a decades-long campaign against diamond-rich African nations... It's really ugly stuff, Frank. ...amassing a fortune for himself while leaving behind a trail of blood. I'm sending you a clean copy of both to the SIM card. Come on, get him. Don't let him get across the line. Come on, guys! Come on! [goal horn] [cheering] Yes, goddamn it! That's my boy! That's my son! Number 19! [cell phone ringing] Leon. I am disappointed. The courier will be here soon enough. I have the girl from Tungsten. I want the reporter's story as dead as the reporter, you got me? We have something he wants. He will come for her. [cell phone beeping] Who the f*ck is this? I was wondering if I could speak to Ian O'Sullivan. This is O'Sullivan...  It's the f*cking courier. Here's how it's going to work, chump. You're going to bring that chip Girlfriend? - The girl from Tungsten. She's not my girlfriend. And might I suggest you watch your tone, or I might get lost  on the way to your hockey game and end up at the Toronto Star. They might be very interested  in this diamond that Sean Gallagher had for them. f*ck you! [Cell phone beeps.] [cell phone vibrating] Yeah. He's on his way. Bring the girl and stash her. What about the driver? I'll take care of the f*cking driver. [muffled shouting] Watch the corridor. Stay here. [muffled shouting] [goal horn] Where's the girl? f*ck you! Oh, yeah? Ugh! How many of these clowns are there? At least three, maybe more. You OK? You came back for me. I told you to run. And leave you behind? You know how hard it is to find a good dentist? Darcy Daniels. You might need this. Come on, let's move it. Come on, Marcus. Don't be a pussy. I taught you to be tough. Marcus! [ref blowing whistle] Marcus! You should've He's gonna salute me. He said he's gonna salute me. See that? Behind every great man is his father. [cell phone chiming] [ref blowing whistle] The courier's here. He's got her. Go find him, Leon! Mr. O'Sullivan, please... be calm. Calm? Calm, you f*cking idiot? That courier has got videotape of you chopping off children's hands, and you want me to be f*cking calm?! I am not a part of this. Yes, you are part of it! Don't you remember where you were before I dragged you out of the mud? Yes, I do. And I will not be going back there. Get rid of this piece of sh1t. Ugh! Do not do that again, or it will be your hand next. Go on, then. Go to hell. We will see each other again. Not if I can help it. Call the cops. Give them Leon's description, tell them where he put Gallagher's body. I'm going after the goddamn courier! Can you put this on the big screen? I think so. OK, go to it. I'll handle O'Sullivan. Wait. That's for luck, "Stan". This is my ice! Come and get it! Commentator : Whoa! We've got the suits and ties on the ice as well! Can you believe it? They're gonna get some scuff marks on their shoes. There's a couple of haymakers exchanged there! Oh-ho-ho, my! I kid you not, I do not recall an evening on the ice like this in some time. Mr. O'Sullivan needs this to be broadcast A-SAP. Who the hell are you? The new program director. Run it. Come on, come on. Yes. Under the guise of industry and natural resources exploration, O'Sullivan waged a decades-long campaign against diamond-rich African nations, amassing a fortune for himself, while leaving behind a trail of blood. [Crowd quietens.] While some who possess such immense wealth choose to give back, O'Sullivan has chosen to only take... in the economic and literal sense... brutally ripping limbs and lives from those in his way. Not content to be merely a profit-driven capitalist guilty of plundering the natural resources of a foreign country, O'Sullivan bears a sadistic streak. Less a capitalist, or even a colonialist, Ian O'Sullivan is a barbarian. Man : Killer! Man : Murderer! Man : You're a disgrace to the game, man! Man : Get off the ice! Man : You're a pig, O'Sullivan! No! It's not true! Man : You're a liar!  No! It is true! All of it! Yes, I said it. You're a monster! [spectators booing] [spectators cheering] Marcus! Marcus! [spectators booing] It's all lies! Man : Get out of here! [spectators booing] [insects chirping] Hello, transporter. We could do with a guy like you for the playoffs. No, thanks. So, that's it? It's over? It is for me. What happens now? I go home. Where's home? Far away. Planes to far away don't usually start leaving till the morning. So I hear. It'd be a shame to spend all night at the airport. I guess it would.
