 ♪ [Suspenseful music comes up] 
 The Black Lotus, one of the most popular restaurants in the heart of Chicago's Chinatown. 
 Great food. Great service. 
 Oh, and it's run by the Triads. 
 Tien, the boss, has got awesoe dim sum cooking in the kitchens. 
 And a pretty tasty chemical weapon cooking in a secret lab upstairs. 
 You gotta order that one off the menu. Table for one? I'm here to see Tien. I don't know any Tien. Uh-huh... You gonna to take me to him? Or am I gonna take myself? [Sound of snapping fingers] There goes baldy, calling over the muscle. His name's Shawn. Head of security for this Triad and Tien's personal bodyguard. Real friendly guy. He wants to see Tien. Check him out. Okay, we're in. [Sound of methodical footsteps] Easy enough. [Sounds of busy kitchen, bustling restaurant staff] Aim of the game is to get to that weapons lab. So far, so good. Oh no! [Sound of pistol firing] Damn it! We may have been a little hasty there. Okay, as I said, the Black Lotus. One of the most popular restaurants in Chicago's Chinatown distric. Dim sum downstairs, chemical weapons upstairs. You get the picture. Table for one? I'm here to see Tien. I don't know any Tien. You gonna to take me to him? Or am I gonna take myself? [Snapping fingers] ♪ [Eerie music comes up] Right, and here we go again. What Frank needs is some kind of distraction. I could use the restroom. Okay, Frank... I would guess that's as good an excuse as any. And thank you Dragon Lady. Now, to find the entrance to the chemical lab. [Man screaming in Chinese] Sensing trouble here. Sorry... Don't speak Cantonese. [Sound of hard kick] This is where the fun begins. [Sounds of violent struggle] I don't think that's on the menu. [Pots crashing to floor, men screaming in Chinese] Oh man! That puts the "ow" in chow mein! [Sound of cook screaming in Chinese] [Sound of pot cracking cook's head] Between a wok and a hard place. Lettuce? Seriously Frank? [Sound of broom striking cook] [Sound of cook screaming in pain] [Sound of hard punch to cook's head] And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Frank Martin is Frank Martin. [Sound of menacing cook, oven door banging] Ha, take that! [Sound of metal chain spinning, hard body blow] Watch out! [Sound of knife landing] ♪ [Exciting music comes up. [Sounds of spinning chain, knives clashing, hard punches] Nice. Uh-oh...  Oh, sh1t! [Sound of rifle firing] Here we go again. One more time. Anyone else getting a déjà vu? Table for one? I don't know any Tien. [Sound of hard punch to bodyguard's face] Night night, asshole. [Shouting in Chinese] All these guys again. Bruce Lee, Wok. Deadly lettuce. [Wild screams, blows, punches and pots crashing] [Sound of powerful kicks] Boom, Frank's done it. [Hard kick breaking open door] Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Tien's secret lair. His gang is guarding the weapon. Who the f*ck are you? It's a private club. I just joined. Uh-oh, big mistake, jerkweed. He hates magic tricks. I said it's a private club. [Sounds of hard blows] Right in his ace of spades. [Sounds of powerful punches and body blows] [Sound of man crashing to floor] [Man screaming in Chinese, devastating body blows] [More kicks and spills] [Sound of powerful kick, crashing bowls] Uh-oh, that's Tien, crime boss. [Sounds of choking, violent struggle] Frank? You might wanna look behind you. [Sounds of bazooka, explosion and flames] [Game buzzer sounds] Can you get him in? Yeah. Can you get him out? Not alive. Alive would be good. ♪ [Theme music comes up] Is there a problem? You could say that. This job's impossible. Nothing's impossible. Look, I've gone through this every which way, Agent Wolfe. This warlord, Tien... Crime boss, not warlord. Okay, whatever... He's got like 20 Bruce Lees on the payroll. We need you to retrieve that weapon, Mr. Martin. I'm just one man. Why doesn't the FBI raid the place? Because if we tried, Tien is crazy enough to release the weapon into the air. Tens of thousands could die. Then why don't you get one of your own men to do it? I have my reasons. And Mr. Martin has a pretty unique skill set. Border Patrol just called. Damian Blake is flying in from Dublin. What? When? Plane's due to land in 30 minutes. Why didn't we know this sooner? Who's Damian Blake? He's a right-wing radical who advocates the violent overthrow of the federal government. His group wants to give the government back to the people, by assassinating the President. So he's a nutjob? And a prime buyer for the weapon Tien just developed. It's everybody's worst nightmare. This stuff falling into the hands of homegrown terrorists. Check this out. Who is this guy? That's one of Tien's men. He's probably on his way to the airport to meet Blake. [Whispering] A hell of a mess. If he gets that weapon, it's game over. Does Tien know what Blake looks like? They've only communicated over the dark net, so I'd say almost certainly not. Why? Blake could be my way in. How? Border Patrol stops him at the airport and I show up in his place. That's brilliant. You'd have to move fast. I'll need Tien's men to pick me up at the airport... which means you need to get Blake out of the way. Okay. I'll call Border Patrol. Frank... This isn't a transporter job anymore. I'm still collecting a package. You were asked to retrieve it, not impersonate a terrorist. Yeah... It's not like you've had much time to prepare. Got a better idea? Okay... I'll brief you on the way to the car. [Sounds of video game] ... Spacial, baby! [Sound of toppling bottles] What the f*ck are you doing? You got me killed, you idiot! Dai lo... What you want, Lim? Take it. Take it! There's a problem, Dai lo. There better not be. The compound is highly unstable. It's not safe to even move it. Wait... You tell me this now? With respect, Dai lo, I've been telling you this all along. A man is coming to take delivery. You understand? And we're gonna give it to him. You got a big brain, Lim. But you know you're problem? You got no balls. Just like your old man. You want to end up like your old man? No. Then get Chimera ready... Now. [Giving a command in Chinese] [Sounds of video game re-starting] [Knocking on car window] Hang on. One last thing. Blake's flying in, he won't be carrying a weapon. Well, maybe you should. That won't be necessary. Listen, Mr. Martin, you're doing a great service to this country. I don't know how to thank you. Don't thank me yet. Good luck. Yeah? Okay, so you're about 10-15 minutes away from the airport. I know. ... Blake's plane is gonna land any minute now. Jules, what is it? It's... It's just... It's my first day is all, I don't want to get you killed. You did already. Three times. Yeah, that was a simulation but... Look Frank, this plan is... Caterina's worried too. I'll be fine. Now don't call me again, unless it's urgent. Understand? I understand, yeah. Jules? Yeah. Thanks. [Sound of jet airliner approaching] [Sound of jet landing] [Sounds of airport PA system] Forged his passport, huh? Yeah. Nice. Oh, you just missed a digit there. Thanks. On its way. Sorry, Mr. Blake... we need to ask you a few questions. Sure. Is everything alright? Is there a problem? What is this about? Looking for me? Damian Blake. You're late. You noticed. No luggage? Like you said, I'm late. Let's go. Alright, follow me. [Sound of hard body blows] [Sounds of more kicks to body, agent falling to ground] Hold it right there! [Sound of powerful punch] [Sound of SUV's wheels squealing] You want some? [Sound of cell phone ringing] Hello? We got a problem. Sorry? I was stopped at the airport. Who is this? Who the f*ck do you think it is? It's Blake. [Sounds of powerful struggle] [Sound of SUV swerving] Hello? [Sound of SUV swerving] [Sounds of struggle] [Sound of Frank closing car trunk] [Cell phone ringing] Frank, we couldn't reach you. Blake's escaped. I gathered that. I'm sending you the cell number Blake's using. I need Jules to track it. What are you going to do? Stop him, of course. What's up? You need to track Blake's number. And send it to Frank immediately. Okay. [Sound of SUV accelerating] One mile from you. ♪ [Suspenseful music comes up] Six hundred meters, Frank. Two hundred. [Sound of cars colliding, Blake's SUV swerving] [Sound of cars colliding, tires squealing] ♪ [Music intensifies] [Sound of Blake's SUV skidding] [Sound of Blake banging on hood] Where are you taking me? And who the f*ck are you? NSA? CIA? Okay. You're a f*cking puppet, whoever you are. I'm a patriot, you understand? I'm a freedom fighter. Say something, you f*cking jerk. What are you, a robot? A f*cking socialist robot? Sell your soul for some shitty car and a three-bed house you never even pay out. You don't even understand what it means to be free. Nobody does anymore. Free to be. To choose, want and to take... who know what it means to get it. You go to college? Yeah, sure I did. Major in philosophy or bullshit? Oh, so you are a f*cking socialist. But this isn't about me, dickhead. This isn't about college or education. Oil and war or... or fancy interventions or whatever else you socialist assholes think it is. This is about about God-fearing Americans who're willing to put their country ahead of themselves, who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to defend her. By killing innocent people? No, Americans who don't stand up to tyranny. They need to wake the hell up, save our country before it's too late. And when we prevail... We will prevail... People like me will be in the history books. For rescuing America in her hour of need. We'll be the heroes of our time. Of all times. [Sound of sharp punch] Right now, it's time to be quiet. You've got nothing on me. You charging me with something? This is exactly the type of tyrannical government... Shut up! Get him out of here. [Sound of Blake spitting] You'll all burn. All of you. You okay? I left you a present on the side of the road. Tien's pickup man. We got him already. You're not still going in there? That's the idea. Don't you think Tien will suspect something, given that his man's missing? Probably, he will but so what? Well, there's another problem. We decoded some message traffic. It seems Tien wants Blake to make a payment. 30 million. Keeps all his funds on the dark net. You name it, you can find it on there. Markets for weapons, drugs... Secret bank accounts, apparently. Blake would have a 10-digit key code to access the funds. Okay. How do we get that? We're working on it. You're working on it? Tien's waiting. And even if you do get the code, how will you get it to Frank? We have a man on the inside. Inside Tien's outfit? He'll be able to share the code with Frank once we have it. Alright then. I'll stall as long as I can. We'll work fast here, Frank. But look, if you're going, you gotta go. Hey, I could really help you find that code. Not necessary, kid. 
 
 [Sounds of busy restaurant] Table for one? I'm here to see Tien. I don't know any Tien. He's expecting me. Damian Blake. [Sound of snapping fingers] [Whispering] It's Damian Blake. He wants to see Tien. You got ID? I'd like that back. You'll get it back. Later. Please follow me, Mr. Blake. He's leaving the dining area. Okay, he's made it to the kitchen. He's heading upstairs. He's good, isn't he? Yeah. You said you have a man on the inside. Yeah, that's right. Why didn't you tell us before? The FBI's not in the habit of sharing its secrets with outside contractors. That's pretty vital information. That's the one on the inside could get us the "in" we needed. Look, I don't know you. Hey, I'm just a little paranoid. What are you talking about? Louis Tien is the FBI's worst nightmare. He's a drug dealer who's graduated to chemical weapons. And every time I've tried to move on him, the evidence has vanished. Bad luck? Luck has nothing to do with it. Why do you think I hired a transporter instead of using one of my own men? You've got a mole. Someone in the bureau hates the government as much as Blake. They want him to get this weapon. Well, if that's true, the mole could be in this room. They could've already betrayed Frank. No, I've vetted everyone on this task force. Turn around. Arms stretched out wide. We've got a problem. What? This access code. We've tried every decryption routine there is, but we're getting nowhere. Well, you could just let me help you. What are you going to do? Have you ever heard of acoustic cryptoanalysis? The analysis of the sound produced during encryption processing... We know what it is. Yeah, well, I run that puppy, chances are it can reverse-code even the most secure site. Not even the FBI has that capability. Yeah, well, I do. You're bluffing. Let him try it. He has no clearance. He does now. Thank you. Were you bluffing? Of course. Then how are you going to get that code? I don't know, but if I don't, they'll kill Frank. Just do it. Okay. [Sounds of video game] Move! [Speaking in Chinese] Dai lo, Mr. Blake is here. Where the hell you been, you prick? Your mother know you talk like that? Answer my question. Your man didn't show up. Jimmy hasn't answered his phone. Why not? Where is he? I don't know. He's a fuck-up. You search him? He's clean. You ready to transfer the money, Mr. Blake? I'm ready. Then let's do this. But I won't. Not until I see the product. What are you talking about? You don't expect me to pay sight unseen. Your associates already saw it. You're here to pay and go, my friend. Not until I see it for myself. Are you a cop, kitty cat? Is that what you are? Wouldn't tell you if I was, would I? [Sound of laughter] No...  You sure as f*ck wouldn't. You're a funny guy, Mr. Blake... You know that? Ah well... You don't pay, you don't leave. Wait here. Well? It's real. Doesn't make it genuine. What are you, a fortune cookie? What the hell does that mean? The passport. Blake flew in from Dublin. Yeah. So? Take a look. What? I don't see anything. Exactly. The stamp. Can't leave Ireland without getting a stamp. Somebody was in a hurry. Somebody who couldn't make a real passport. Our funny friend's a Fed. Right this way, Mr. Blake. Where's Tien? Waiting up in the lab. [Sounds of violent blows] [More rapid punches] What the hell is this? You've got a funny way of treating your customers, Mr. Tien. Your passport, you rat. You forget to get it stamped. You think I carry only one passport? In my line of work? [Voices of FBI agents interrogating Blake] What would he have done with it if he'd got that weapon? Men like Blake think this country's gone so far off track, the only way to save it is to destroy it. Like setting off a chemical weapon at the White House. Yeah. Capitol Hill. Wall Street. He's a sick man. A lot of men suffer from the same illness. Right? They think they're patriots. "I have but one life to lose for my country... " The FBI will never want for work. Cat, Agent Wolfe... Can I please have a word alone? We are alone. Yeah, just not here. Jules, what is it? I got it. The access code to Blake's 30 million. Great. Let's give it to Frank. There's a problem. Jules, whatever it is, it can wait. No. It can't. What's the matter? When I located Blake's account, I could see that somebody had already accessed it late last night. 10: 16 p.m. Who did? Well, I tracked the IP address. It's a laptop, government issue. No, hang on, government issue? It belongs to Agent Cleef. He's your mole. No, I've known Dan Cleef for nearly ten years. Dan's got a wife, he's got two kids. Are you absolutely sure it's him? Money was transferred into the account last night from an untraceable source. I mean, that's probably why he was in Dublin. Then Blake must have backers funding him. Zealots who want to bring down the government as much as he does. Cleef's their middleman? I don't buy it. He was probably just checking to see that there was money in the account. It makes sense. Right now, we can't say anything. If Cleef knows we know, he might expose Frank. He might anyways. We're gonna make sure that doesn't happen. Well, I hope so. And I don't want him in there talking to Blake anymore. But right now, we've got to get the code to Frank. Okay. What were you doing in Dublin? Drinking beer. What do you care? You know something, Mr. Blake? I really admire what you stand for. Blowing up the government and sh1t. Is that so? I had nothing growing up. Now look. I built this all by myself. I'm the American dream. Selling chemical weapons. It's called freedom, baby. You don't see me crying for no government handouts... unlike those lazy-ass immigrants f*cking up the economy. Lim. Come here. This is our customer. Got his package ready? It's ready. Good. He's going to need a little demonstration first. Think you can arrange that? Hold on a sec. Lim... Tell Mr. Blake who your father was. A chemist. A very brilliant man. Ten times smarter than me. But he couldn't find a job in this country, so I had him build this meth lab. You know where he is now? I gather you're going to tell me. Dead. You know why? Because when I saw that I could make ten times more selling a chemical weapon, the old man wouldn't do it. Why not, Lim? Because he thought it was wrong. And now his son is doing the same job for me. And almost as good. You know what's more important than being smart? Being strong. Let's get on with this. Cleef? You sent the code? Just now. Our man has it. How are you gonna get that code to Frank? Don't worry, our man will get it to him. For his own reasons, he wants to stop Tien just as much as we do. He's about to become a very wealthy man. Not for long. As soon as Frank delivers us the weapon, we'll shut down Tien and get that money back. What about Blake? Where are they taking him? He's got a nice cell waiting for him at Joliet. You think that's a good idea? He's not telling us anything here. Okay, time to go, Blake. [Sound of agent's head on table] No, no, freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Cat, watch out! Easy. You're going to give me car keys. You're not going anywhere, Blake. Listen to that kid because I'm gonna blow her brains out. The second you do that, you're dead, too. That's the difference between you and me. I'm not afraid to die for my country. You're not gonna get very far. Why don't you shut up, bitch. Jules... On the counter beside me, give him the keys. What? Just do it. He's not bluffing. [Sound of pistol shots at close range, Blake collapsing] Check him. Oh sh1t! Nice shot. Thank you. Jules. I'll take those. You okay, Ms. Boldieu? Fine. She just killed him. Just in time, Shawn. Lim is about to demonstrate our product to Mr. Blake here. As you know, the hard part with chemical weapons isn't the chemicals. Any druggist can make poison. The problem is, how do you get it to hang in the air long enough so it kills lots of people? Watch this. Impressive. The secret's a vapor, so fine it spreads quickly and not even the wind can blow it away. Lim, tell him what the numbers mean. A vial this size could spread across Chicago, and stay in the air as long as six hours. On a good day? That's nearly 10 million people. Dead. At 3 bucks a person. I'd say you're getting a pretty good deal, Mr. Blake. How many more of those vials do you have? Just the ones we made for you. We even packed it to go for you. Not sure how you take it. Thanks. I make a lousy cup. But you look like you could use this. I'm alright. It's not like it's the first time I've been threatened in this job. I guess not. The ambulance is on its way. Pam is down there waiting with your friend. Is she alright? Pamela? She's as tough as they come. Must take a lot out of you, this kind of job. She would never show it. She's a true believer. And you're not? I love my job. I love the challenge, but I have a family. Whereas Pam... Sometimes she doesn't even go home at night. What about last night? I'm sorry? Were you late? Not last night. I was home by 9 to tuck in my kids. Thanks for the coffee. All packed and ready to go. But like any restaurant, you got to pay the check first. Just type your bank code in there. [Low ringing sound] You okay? Yeah, my ears are still ringing but at least I wasn't the one who had a gun pointed at his head. Yeah. It's not like it's the first time. So, any word on Frank? Not yet. It looks like he's still in the lab. At least it means that traitor hasn't gotten him killed yet. I don't think Cleef's the traitor. What are you talking about? Let's go. What? You said he had access to his computer last night. Yeah. But he wasn't here. You know who was working late? Wait. Agent Wolfe? Don't you think the timing of this was a little odd? Blake just happening to show up in the morning? So, you think she planned this? Well, she knew Frank wouldn't succeed by himself. And she made sure of that by not telling us about the inside man. So when Blake turned up, Frank would volunteer to take his place. She counted on it. I don't get it. Why? Why would she do that? You know all that "one life to give" stuff. She was really talking about herself. She and Blake were working against the government. Okay, we just watched Agent Wolfe... She shot him, right in front of us. Yeah, well, she had to. To keep him from being questioned, or he would end up exposing her. Blake could never succeed. He would just end up being arrested with the weapon and the investigation would have fallen out of her hands. sh1t, if you're right, she's an evil genius. Yeah, and if Frank hands her that weapon, he'll just be giving it to the terrorists he's trying to stop. What's the matter, Mr. Blake? You forget your code? Turn around. What do you think this is? An ATM? You can't see the code. Turn around. You done? I'm done. Make good use of it. Shawn will see you out. You wrote this, didn't you? Who are you working for? Huh? Stop him! Stop him! Shawn, stop him! Stop him! [Sounds of head butt, powerful punches] [Sound of Shawn rolling down stairs] [Sound of sharp punch] [Sounds of powerful kicks] [Sounds of violent struggle] [Man screaming in Chinese, sounds of violent blows] [Sounds of Frank battling restaurant workers] Come into my place! f*ck you! You son-of-a-bitch! [Sound of pistol firing, people screaming] That was for my father. It's Frank, he's coming out! He's got the case. You got it, Frank. Where's the weapon? Destroyed, along with all the research to develop it. You got my message then? Yeah. What message? Did you think you would get away with it? Agent Wolfe, Cleef wasn't the mole. You are. "I have but one life to give"? You're with Blake. I'm a patriot. I've always done what's best for my country. You're a nutjob. You won't be able to prove anything. Maybe they won't. But you were the only one who had access to my laptop last night. That I can prove. This country is in serious trouble. It's not going to get better unless something is done. Like releasing a chemical weapon? Oh sweety. You have no idea the damage you've done today. Oh, I think we do. Internal Affairs is waiting. We'll need your statement. I cannot thank you enough. You got it. Well that's not bad for a first day, Jules. Oh, thanks, you think? So... I can stay on then? What? Was that a "yes"? Or "maybe"? Get in the car. What... ? Okay.
