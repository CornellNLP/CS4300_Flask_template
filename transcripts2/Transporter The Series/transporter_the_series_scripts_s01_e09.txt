 "City of Love"  ("Une Bombe dans Paris") 
 [ sizzling ] 
 Bottle of Bordeaux. The Chateau Franc-Cardinal. 
 Yeah, I ordered it this afternoon. Your manager said it would be here by six o'clock. 
 I don't care what the problem is. Just make the delivery. 
 I'm sorry. It's not a threat, no. 
 Ten minutes? OK. Thank you. 
 A Votre Santé Cellars? 
 I'd like to order a bottle of the Chateau Franc-Cardinal. 
 For delivery. The '06 will be fine. 
 Never serve old wine. Rule number seven, Frank. 
 [ knocking on door ] 
 Mmm. Chateaubriand? 
 Looks like a good pairing. 
 Aren't you going to invite me in? 
 Of course. Please, come in. 
 I hope you like the Franc-Cardinal. 
 It's an '06. 
 An '06? 
 I was surprised you returned my call. 
 Your message was very cryptic. I thought I'd better answer. 
 What's so cryptic about wanting to talk? 
 We hardly know each other. 
 Yeah. 
 I should have brought two bottles. 
 The market in town was supposed to deliver a bottle... of this very wine, as it happens. 
 Yeah. They must have got lost along the way. 
 Or something went wrong with the delivery. 
 Things can be so... unpredictable. 
 [ knocking on door ] 
 I'm very sorry for the late delivery. There was a problem with the van and then I had to wait and then we had to find another case. 
 That's all right. You're here now. 
 That's all right. Thank you. Thank you. These were up by your gate. Maybe someone else left them as well. Maybe. Perhaps I should take these bottles back? Thank you. Never change the deal. [ She laughs. ] Yeah. How did you get the Alberta beef anyway? I brought it straight from Canada. Canada? You were there for business? Yes, as a matter of fact. I'm in shipping. That's funny, because I thought it was illegal to bring meat into the country. Are you going to alert the authorities? No. Just curious how you avoid official channels. I just walked through customs. Nobody stopped me. Hiding in plain sight? Not hiding, really. I just forgot that it was in my bag. Yeah. I can see how you might forget that. But I'm glad nobody stopped you. I try not to let things get in my way. Maybe it's better if I... No. Stay. It might be nice to lie down. [ cell phone ringing ] Excuse me. Another woman? A coworker. I've heard that before. [ laughs. ] Morning, Frank. No, it's not. Late night? None of your business. You'd normally be in bed by now. Yes, that was the plan. The plan's changed, Frank. Pick up's in 90 minutes. I'll send you coordinates when you're on the road. Sorry. Work. Delivery problems? Mmm. Let's hope not. We have to do it again soon. I'd like that. Maybe something more... a little bit less... illegal? I was hoping for something much more illegal. [ She laughs. ] ♪ I get up at seven, yeah ♪

A man who looks like that won't arouse suspicion from police. You are quiet, Farouk. There is so much sadness already. Yes, but the dishonour of my family will be avenged. Ask yourself this: can we afford the price of allowing my brother's death to go unanswered? radio : Difficult travel conditions throughout Paris today. There will be police activity at all major access points to the city until further notice. Congestion is expected around the entire Périphérique. [ police sirens ] Welcome to the "City of love". [ knocking on window ] Morning, officer. What's the problem? Papers, please. What's this all about? Papers, please, monsieur. [ growling ] [ dogs barking ] Step out of the car! [ gunshots ] [ police sirens ] OK, monsieur, you can go. Come on. Move it, please. man : OK, what do we have? A black Audi A8 ran one of the police checkpoints. Did we get the license plate? I just checked. Uh, it's a fake number, but a surveillance camera just caught this. OK, have you ID'd him yet? No. It just came in. We are cleaning up the image, then we'll cross-match with the database, see if we get a hit. Good. OK, let's get it out there fast. [ dialling ] Frank, I was starting to get worried. Taking a slight detour. The client was very specific:   you were to stick to the agreed route. I would have, Carla,  but there was a problem with the authorities. You have a lot of problems with the authorities. What do you want me to do? Contact the client. The deal's changed,  but it was nobody's fault. I'll still make the drop, but I'm going to be a little late. [ music ] ♪ Like an earthquake you will wake it ♪

The police are saying there was some kind of device detected by a dog team. What sort of device? Nothing's been released, but the DCRF has recalled all its analysts. Which means? There's a terrorist threat. And they think I have something to do with it. Fine. # That's just how we do it # You are in the wrong part of town. I'm just dropping off a package, then I'll be on my way. That's not how this works. How does this work? You come here, you pay a toll. Oh. All right. How much? We keep the car and you can go. Believe me, you don't want that car. Oh, I want it. I love Audis. With all due respect, I don't have time for this. Neither do I.

[ voicemail beep ] Hey, it's Carla. The DCRF are looking for you. They have put out a shoot-to-kill order. Call me back. I'm close. The surveillance has been very thorough. The profile is almost complete. I do what I can. You should know there's some concern about your involvement with the transporter. From? The people you'd expect. They don't know what they are talking about. It's understood we're still not making contact? That's understood. We don't want any mistakes. There will be no mistakes. I believe you. - Merci. My name is Mauga. And you? No names. Dead men don't need names, so that's OK. Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at things. So, are you going to explain what the f*ck you're doing here? I make deliveries. I was hired to deliver something to this, um... address. This was in the trunk. You opened it? What the f*ck else am I going to do with it? You're not supposed to open the package. What's that? Some kind of rule? You might not understand. What I don't understand, Mr. Business Suit, is what you're doing bringing this... ...to my part of town. That's why you don't open the package. Why the f*ck did you bring a bomb into my territory? The bomb is mine. It belongs to me. What the hell are you doing here? I've come to get my property. And you, you're as good a transporter as advertised. Without your help, I wouldn't have gotten into Paris. You conspire to bring this to my place? This... place... disgusting. What do you plan to do with it? What should have been done a long time ago. Take your sh1t and get out. You have no idea what you've done. Why don't you let me down? Maybe I can help. Get the f*ck away from me! And watch him! Oh, driver! The only way you're coming down... is as a f*cking corpse! Let's go. Hey, get this piece of sh1t started. Hi. I need to speak to Agent Thierry LeFevre. No, I'm sorry, no civilian access permitted. Carla? It's been, like, uh, three years? That's right. Great to see you. Good to see you. Please come in my office. Sure. It's OK. She has clearance. [ Mauga speaking French ] Hey, handsome. Tell your pals that driving around Paris is the last thing they want to do if they want to stay out of jail. Do you speak French? I'll take that as a no. So, you're here because of what happened this morning? You mean the bomb threat? How do you know that? Come on, Thierry, we have the same sources as you do. Oh, so then you already know that terrorist chatter has gone up considerably in the past three days. Talk of Jihad retaliation. That's what happens if you decide to take out a North African dictator. The reason for this kind of attack is irrelevant, OK? Our job is to stop it. Maybe knowing the reason can help you stop it. Well, maybe all I care about IS stopping it. Have you had any hits? We knew a couple of hours ago it was in the trunk of a black Audi that was stopped at the road block in the city centre of Paris. There was one driver, and we have a photo. Excuse me. You are needed in Master Control. I'm coming. One second. 
 
 [ Farouk speaking foreign language ] Today we reclaim our pride. This is not the time for weakness, brother. Remember why we do this. Farouk, tell me why we do this. Remember Qani. Pray for him. Pray for us. Hey, stupid. I was thinking: if my dog had a face like yours, I'd shave its ass and teach it to walk backwards. Do you know the meaning of the word "thabiha"? Anything to do with letting me go find that bomb before somebody gets hurt? Oh, you're a funny man. You ever see a goat bleed from the neck? You ever see that goat laughing? No, actually. Let's go downstairs. Would it be rude of me to ask why? No more questions. [ Mauga speaking French ] Frank : Where are we going? Mauga : To work in peace. Frank : Work? Mauga : The bleeding. Frank : What are you talking about? Why don't you just go about your business? This whole thabiha routine is getting a little distracting. I like you. You are a brave man. But you bring that filth, that bomb into my neighbourhood. I'm just the messenger. If you don't like the message, maybe you should talk to whoever sent it. Why don't you shut the f*ck up and mind your own business? You're about to slit my throat. The way I see it, that makes it my business. In my family, we wet our lips with the blood of the sacrifice. Shows respect. You deserve at least that. I can help you. The bomb. The bomb has nothing to do with me. If you really... Mauga! Mauga. You have to... you have to help me. Gassam has gone crazy. You should have stopped him, Farouk! Ugh! Tell me. Tell you what? Who has the bomb, Mauga? You saw him take it! Gassam! You saw! I saw him, yes. Who is he? What does he want? Where is he going to put that bomb? I don't know. Why does he want the bomb? Tell me. Why? He wants it for revenge. Why would he have me bring it to you? He wants me to know what he's going to do. He's my brother. [ police sirens ] Cops. Hey, go! Come on! You drive. I need you in the back, behind the driver's seat. Buckle up, gentlemen. [ car starting ] I'm not lying. This car is going nowhere until you buckle up. It's a rule. Do it, you f*cking idiots! And what about me? You just hold on tight. You drive carefully. [ police sirens ] [ tires screeching ] [ door unlocked ] What did you bring him to our home for? He is not a part of this. You made him part of this, Gassam. Where's the bomb? Farouk has taken it. He came to see your sister. He wanted us to stop you. He wanted you to help with the bomb, to take it to the site. Which I would never do! He knows that, you know that. You're lying. Farouk is with me. Nothing will stop us. Does he know? Tell him. Tell him what happened. Three years ago, our brother, Qani, he was shot. He didn't have his papers, the cops saw him, he ran, they thought he was going to pull a gun. My brother died, behind a truck in a filthy loading dock. They assassinated him! He died because of the colour of his skin! It was political murder! They destroyed our family. Tell him! Our mother moved back home. She died last year. Because we did nothing. She knew. She could see we did nothing. No, Gassam, because she saw what was happening to you! You're dying inside! All you can talk about is blood and revenge! Which is more than what you did... hanging around your drug dealers. They cared about me! After Qani died... He was murdered! And where were you? Huh? When I needed you, where were you? Gone. With your "comrades", planning, planning, planning. Nothing but hate. What about me? You forgot about your sister? Tell us where the bomb is. No one else needs to die. Yes. Yes, they do. No, Gassam! [ gunshots ] Gassam! Where's he going? I don't know. He has friends all over the city. And Farouk? Farouk will do as Gassam tells him. He came to the warehouse. He wanted to warn you. Yes, but he's weak. You need to get the word out. Anyone who sees Farouk or Gassam. Yeah, I have it. What is it? Herve. He's a mechanic. He was recently hired by Gassam to paint a stolen utility van pink. Pink. There was a pink van behind me at the police checkpoint. He says he sent it to a warehouse. This is the address. What are we waiting for? [ door opening ] It's 4 PM now. Let's set it for 60 minutes. Should give us enough time to deposit the bomb and get clear of the area. Gassam, no. We should not do this. I have family here in Paris. You have family in Kueresh, don't you? They are killing our people as we speak! They invaded our country! And they will kill more if we detonate this bomb! Don't you see? This will only bring more pain and misery to our nation! I am sick of standing back and letting them do with us as they please, for their benefit, not ours! This is what needs to be done, and I will do it. You talk so much about our nation and our people, but this is your personal revenge. What does it matter if it is personal? They treat us like dogs and shoot us in the streets! Admit it, then! This is for Qani! What does it matter why these people die, so long as they do? [ beeping ] In one hour, the people of Paris will feel the bite of this dog's teeth. You'd better come see this. He wants to talk to someone in charge. OK. What do you want? Are you the agent in charge? In charge of what? In charge of finding the bomb. Yes, I am. He is going to detonate the bomb at 5 PM. Where? Where are you now? We are about to leave for the... [ gunfire ] OK, we have to track that caller! We have less than an hour to find that bomb. And can someone please tell me where the f*ck is this black Audi?! Let's move! Thierry. Yes? The guy in the black Audi. He works for me. sh1t, Carla, you have a man on the inside? What are you waiting for? Where is he now? I don't know. Here. [ Mauga speaking French ] He's dead. Probably fake. Doesn't matter. Get your guys on it. We need to find that van. Found it! Where is it? The alley behind Gare du Nord. Let's go. Frank. Are you all right? Carla, I know where the bomb is. You need to send help. It's at the Gare du Nord. They're at the Gare du Nord train station! Gare du Nord, people! The bomb is at Gare du Nord! Frank? Door. Move it. [ beeping ] Carla. What is your connection with these terrorists? The man in the Audi? Come on, Thierry, you've known me for years. I thought so. Sir, all units are reporting. We are establishing a perimeter. Watch her. What's up? Hey, what's up? Did you see them? All right, cool. Momo, they're in the building. Faster! [ announcement in French ] [ cell phone ringing ] Oui? Oui, j'arrive. That was Momo. He said they're out back in the loading dock. Let's go. [ cell phone ringing ] What is it? My police contact. They know where we are. We have to move the bomb. I can't risk them getting here in time to defuse it. We still have 14 minutes. That leaves us not enough time to get away from the area before it... Then we will die as martyrs for our people, which is an even greater honour. Let's go. We're changing the location. Gassam! Please! Stay out of this, Mauga! I'm begging you. It will fix nothing. At least his death will be answered! Put the bag down! I will die first! No, Gassam, please! I've lost too many brothers. [ police sirens approaching ] [ tires screeching ] officer : Everyone put down your weapons! All of you! Ah! Mauga! Hold on. Mauga. Hold on. You've got to hold on! Just hold on. f*ck. I'm sorry about this, man. I didn't mean to drag you into this sh1t. [i] officer : I said put down your weapons! Ah, f*ck... My brother, he's crazy... but he really loved Qani. Don't. Just relax. f*ck.  When will this sh1t end? How far are we from the Eiffel Tower? I'm not sure. Ten minutes? Cover me. What are you doing? Making a statement. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! [ beeping ] [ cell phone ringing ] What? There's an explosion containment unit next to the river in Bercy. They're ready and waiting for you. I've got the bomb in a black Smart car. Give them the heads up. I've got less than two minutes till this thing goes off.  - Got it. [ people shouting in alarm ] [ honking ] [ beeping ] [ officer speaking French ] Let him through! Let him through! Come on! Come on! Come on! [ beeping ] [ crash! ] Move! Move! Come on! Come on! Come on! [ explosion ] He made it! Yes! [ cheering and applause ] Yeah? Oh! Oh! "A terrorist attack was prevented at the Gare du Nord in Paris yesterday. Witnesses say  the bomber was stopped by a street gang and a civilian who disappeared. The police are calling him a hero and would like to speak with him." Speaking of which, we have to talk. I don't like the sound of that. Do you know a young woman named Juliette Dubois? Sounds vaguely familiar. She seems to be quite familiar with you. I dug a little into her past, and... she is trouble, Frank. How much trouble? Big trouble. Very big trouble. [ music ]
