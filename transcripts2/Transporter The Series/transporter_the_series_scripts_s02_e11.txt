 Announcer : There's Big News out in front of the pack by three lengths, pushing early just beyond the second turn, running hard to the rail. Now with Daksha pulling around, My Lucky Stars jolts to the inside. Daksha will be at mid-pack as they race for the turn. Stevens and Old Fashioned run, but now it's Daksha, pulling up ahead! Daksha's moving down the track. Halibut is trying to close the gap. Daksha's down to the 16, followed by Running Armstrong, just to the outside. Tries to get the right, but it's... Daksha! The winner! 
 Easy, easy, easy... 
 Easy. 
 How was he? 
 34 and change. 
 That's not good enough. 
 Yeah, it was good enough to win the Derby and the Preakness. 
 Yeah, but it's not good enough for Belmont. I mean, that's such a long race. He's gotta have endurance. 
 Daksha's not back to peak yet. 
 Just a little tired, aren't you, baby? 
 He's more than tired, Ray, and you know it. 
 Just give him a chance to show you what he's made of. 
 Alice, you know it's vital that we win Belmont tomorrow. 
 Yes, of course. 
 So I need to know that you're gonna do your best to bring home that Triple Crown. 
 Otherwise, I'm gonna find me a new jockey faster than you can spit. 
 Great. I always ride to win. You know that. 
 You're gonna be making history, for Daksha and for yourself. 
 Well... we hope. 
 Come on... 
 That's my girl, hm? I'll see you at breakfast. 
 See you then. 
 See you later, Daksha. 
 Good boy. Good boy. 
 (Whinnying) 
 How'd you get out, huh? 
 Someone's in the barn. Stay with Daksha. 
 Okay. 
 The horses are loose in the barn. We need help. 
 Okay? We need help! 
 (Alarm ringing) 
 Frank, look. 
 This is the stable. 
 I see. 
 Help! Help! Someone, help! 
 You know what this'll do to your face, little girl? 
 Okay? 
 Get the girl and the horse out of here! 
 Hey! 
 Let's go! 
 ♪ 
 Mr. Martin. 
 Ray Henson. 
 Talk about good timing. 
 My associate, Jules Faroux. 
 Ma'am. 
 How are you? 
 How's the injured guard doing? 
 He's got a concussion, but the doctor said he'll be okay. 
 How are you doing? 
 Fine, thank you. 
 I got round-the-clock security, and still this b*st*rd manages to sneak in here. 
 I'd be dead by now if you hadn't shown up. So would Daksha. 
 It was a pretty bold attack. 
 Yeah, well, they've already tried poisoning his feed, leaving nails on the track, but now they're desperate. 
 Only 24 hours. Belmont. 
 Who's "they"? 
 I got my ideas, but I can't be certain. 
 And your best guess? 
 Howard Vorchek. 
 He's a casino operator. 
 Pretty shady character. 
 What makes you think it's him? 
 If Daksha weren't in the race, his horse, Snow Clash, would be favoured to win. 
 Whoever it was, someone's been sending these threatening text messages to my phone all week. 
 Uh, I'd like to take a look at those messages. 
 I mean, we might be able to track them. 
 Chances are they're from a throwaway, but you never know. 
 Um, my phone's in the kit room. 
 Great. 
 Look, all that really matters is that you get that animal safely to the track, first thing tomorrow morning, Mr. Martin. 
 I'll do my best, but I'd advise you to call the police. 
 That's exactly what Vorchek wants us to do. 
 Create controversy, distraction. 
 I'd say he's done enough of that already, Ms. Henson. 
 It's only another 24 hours. 
 We just need to keep our eyes on the prize. 
 Plenty of time for the police after. 
 So, you're, uh, a jockey? 
 Yeah. 
 That's cool. I didn't know there were many female jockeys. 
 Yeah, there aren't. 
 And I would be the first to win the Triple Crown. 
 Wow, that's... that's amazing. 
 You could say that. 
 Do you actually know what the Triple Crown is? 
 No. 
 Heh-heh, okay. It's when the same horse wins the biggest three races of the year, so it's Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes. 
 That must be pretty hard to do. 
 Yeah, no one's done it in nearly 40 years. 
 But Daksha and I have got a shot. 
 Yeah, well, if anyone can get you there tomorrow, it's Frank. 
 He's that good, huh? 
 Yeah, and he's competitive, like yourself. 
 He doesn't like to lose. 
 (Computer beeping) 
 Ah. Yeah, it was a throwaway, just like I thought. 
 Okay, whoa. That's good. 
 Course there's a horse trailer, but what's with the cargo truck? 
 It's a blind. 
 We'll be less vulnerable in two vehicles. 
 That makes sense. 
 How is he on a long journey? 
 Well, he doesn't much like them, but 12 hours should be okay. 
 It's gonna be longer than that. 
 What on Earth for? 
 Interstate's the shortest route, but it's not the safest. 
 Mr. Martin, he's got a race to run. 
 12 hours is about all he can take. 
 Can you stay with the horse while it's being loaded? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 I need a word in private. 
 Okay. 
 This isn't like transporting a person or a package. 
 Yes, I get that. 
 Usually on a job I can take evasive action, but on this one, I can't, not without risking injury to the horse. 
 I was promised you would get him to the track, rested and ready. 
 I'll get him there, if you let me do it my way. 
 And what exactly is your way? 
 By not telling you or anyone else how I'm gonna do it. 
 Well, is there anything you can tell us? 
 That I'll get him there safe and sound. 
 (Whinnying) 
 You have any idea how much that horse is worth, Mr. Martin? 
 I'm told 10 million. 
 Three times that in stud fees if he wins tomorrow. 
 We will see you at Belmont Park tomorrow morning, bright and early. 
 All set? 
 Yeah, ready to go. 
 You'll ride in the trailer with me, Ms. Butt. 
 Okay. 
 Jules will take the cargo truck. 
 I'm counting on you, darling. 
 You take good care of our baby now. 
 Later. 
 ♪ 
 Would've thought Daksha'd be upset after this morning. 
 So quiet back there. 
 Perfect passenger. 
 You're obviously devoted to him. 
 Yeah, well, Daksha's an incredible horse. 
 I've been training with him since he was a yearling, so... 
 He's pretty much my best friend. 
 Have you ever lost a package? 
 Not yet. 
 Do you ever ride horses? 
 I stick to cars. 
 Where's Jules going? 
 He's gone to run an errand. 
 It's about time. 
 Is that the guy from this morning? 
 Same vehicle. 
 You don't seem surprised. 
 I'm not. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Take him for a ride. 
 You can't outrun a 4x4 in this thing. 
 I don't intend to. 
 I don't understand. 
 Daksha! 
 (Horn blaring) 
 Frank! Slow down! 
 You can't drive like this. You'll hurt Daksha. 
 ♪ 
 Where's Daksha? 
 (Knocking) 
 Well, well, well... 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 You know him? 
 Tommy Sans, third rate talent, all-round son-of-a-bitch. 
 Nice to see you to, Ray. 
 What's your connection? 
 Used to train horses for my daddy. 
 Then he started taking bribes to throw races. 
 But this is low. 
 Even for you. 
 Wearing a mask over your head? Killing horses for a living? 
 No, not for a living. 
 Maybe for fun. 
 Christ. 
 Who are you working for, Sans? 
 No, no. Don't tell me. 
 All right, I already know. Howard Vorchek. 
 I'm not talking, except to the cops. 
 The cops? 
 Damn straight. You're the one who's breaking the law here, holding me against my will. It's kidnapping. 
 Well? 
 Let's keep him here until we deliver the horse. 
 Gladly. 
 It'll make a great headline. 
 Horse wins Triple Crown. Owner jailed for kidnapping. 
 Put a gag on that man. 
 Now we know who's trying to kill my horse. 
 Remains a mystery where Daksha is. 
 Mr. Martin doesn't seem to want to tell us, but I'm guessing Jules put him in the cargo truck. 
 That's right. 
 And you figured Sans would follow us. 
 Seemed like a fair assumption, yeah. 
 Yeah, but why would you keep it a secret from me and from Alice? 
 You don't trust us. 
 I don't share information unless I need to. 
 What is that, a rule of yours or something? 
 You're in debt, are you not, Ms. Henson? 
 And how do you know that? 
 My team vetted the job before I accepted. 
 Yeah, I'm not ashamed of it. 
 Horse like Daksha comes along maybe once in a lifetime. 
 Well worth sinking everything I own into him. 
 The reason I ask is that the horse could lose tomorrow, whereas an insurance company claim would be a sure thing. 
 What are you insinuating. 
 If I was interested in the insurance money why would I hire a transporter to protect him? 
 Well, to make it look like you're innocent. 
 If you're counting on my failure to deliver. 
 I'm afraid I'm not that clever, Mr. Martin. 
 Besides, as Alice will tell you, I don't like to lose. 
 Ever. 
 Now, would you please go and get my horse? 
 We have a race to win. 
 Will do, ma'am. 
 Yeah! Go, go, go, go! 
 Oh, you son-of-a-bitch! 
 Man, he's fast! 
 34, Mr. Vorchek. 
 He's a goddamn lightning bolt. 
 He's gonna make you proud tomorrow. 
 He bloody well better, man. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Ah, the grand old lady of Kentucky herself. Hello, Ray. 
 This has gone far enough, Howard. 
 Now I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 I'm sure you do. 
 We need to talk. 
 I'm listening. 
 No, face to face. 
 Yeah, when? Where? 
 One hour, Lane Field Road. 
 Sure, I'll be there. 
 Is everything all right, Mr. Vorchek? 
 (Chuckling) 
 Actually, Jeff, I think things are about to get a whole lot better. 
 Everything okay? 
 Fine. 
 How's Daksha? 
 He's doing all right. 
 How's he been? 
 I don't know, he didn't say anything. 
 Oh, I did see him twitch, though. 
 A twitch? 
 Yeah, when I looked back, his hind legs were sort of twitching, weirdly. 
 Yeah, well, I mean, he's been cooped up here for hours, right? 
 Is it all right if I take him for a little break, Mr. Martin? 
 Sure. Just a short one. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, hey. 
 I was just about to give him a carrot. Do you wanna try? 
 Uh, yeah, sure. How do I... 
 Oh, just... 
 You gotta hold your hand out flat, like a tray. 
 Okay. 
 And then he doesn't get your fingers. 
 Wow! 
 Yeah. Heh-heh... 
 Yeah, I wouldn't want that. I'd be out of a job. 
 Oh, yeah, computer guy. Of course. 
 Yeah. Computers, cars, anything mechanical. 
 Animals, not so much. 
 Animals are my whole world. 
 I'd do just about anything for this horse. 
 Yeah, I can see that. I mean, he seems pretty special. 
 World class racer, right? 
 Yeah, well, it's more than that, you know? 
 You spend so much time together, you build up a relationship with a horse like this. 
 He's pretty much my best friend. 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh... I was just thinking of something Ray told me one time. 
 To be a winner, you have to put yourself first. 
 You have to be a little ruthless. 
 It's tough to be selfish like that, you know? 
 But Belmont's a big race. It's really important. 
 It's really competitive. 
 You gotta be on your game. 
 Yeah. 
 Frank : Jules, Alice, time to go. 
 Should get going. 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 ♪ 
 You better wake her up. 
 What? Why? 
 Pull over for gas. 
 Hoo! You look good, Ray. 
 Cut the crap, Howard. 
 You know, I don't know why you insist on treating me like the enemy, 'cause I'm not. 
 I know what you're doing. 
 You call off your dogs, and I won't call the cops. 
 I honestly don't know what you're talking about. 
 Tommy Sans has been trying to kill Daksha. 
 You've been paying him to do it. 
 I did hear about the attacks on your horse, and I'm real sorry, Ray. Daksha's a hell of a fine horse. 
 You and I both know Snow Clash is second favourite. 
 You want him to be first. 
 That only happens if Daksha doesn't run. 
 Honey, I got no problem with Daksha running, 'cause if he does, I make even more money. 
 I just want to minimize our mutual risk. 
 Our mutual risk? 
 Okay, what I'm about to say to you is a conversation that never happened. 
 I'm listening. 
 Let Snow Clash win tomorrow and you'll have more money than you'll ever need. 
 How do you figure that? 
 I own a string of casinos, several internet gambling sites, bets could be made under false names, all for Snow Clash, the second favourite, to win. 
 If we double down, we stand to make... who knows how much. 
 It's not gonna do us much good if we're both in prison. 
 It's a risk, I'll grant you, but really, you can't afford not to take it, Ray. 
 I know the bank's about to foreclose on your farm. 
 Even if Daksha run tomorrow, you'd have to sell him, just to pay off the bank. 
 That is one thing I will never do. 
 Oh, hell, I know you love your horse, Ray, but I also know you're desperate. 
 Desperate enough to hire Sans yourself? 
 I didn't hire Sans and you know it. 
 Now you are the one who is up to your eyeballs in debt. 
 And all your casinos and gaming sites, they don't bring in half as much as you need to pay 'em off. 
 I think you're the one who really needs the money. 
 I'll tell you something. 
 Snow Clash is fast as hell. 
 He may win tomorrow whether Daksha runs or not. 
 What makes you think I would ever cut a deal with you? 
 Well, you're here, aren't you? 
 You didn't go to the police with your crazy theories. 
 You came to me. 
 And you know what? I think we'd make a pretty good team. 
 Think about it, Ray. 
 I'll be here if you wanna talk. 
 What are you doing? 
 What? 
 You've never tried hot sauce and maple syrup on... 
 No. 
 Oh, it's fantastic. You gotta try it. 
 No I... I... I can't. I gotta watch my weight. 
 I'm not allowed to eat. 
 Come on, it's like a Canadian tradition. 
 Seriously, try it. It's really, really good. 
 Okay... 
 Right? 
 That's disgusting. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, that's gross. 
 Sorry. 
 (Laughing) 
 What? Do I have something on my face? 
 No. 
 So, how did you get into computers? 
 Oh, well, um... I always liked knowing how things work. 
 I mean, it's not that crazy. It's just... like learning a new language, you know? 
 No, it is. I mean, nobody... I don't understand computers. 
 I don't know anyone who understands computers. 
 Y'all want more coffee? 
 Oh, yeah, please. 
 Thanks. 
 All right, y'all enjoy. 
 So, how'd you get into horseracing? 
 I just... loved horses, you know? 
 I mean, every kid loves horses, but I just wanted to be around them all the time. 
 I didn't care about playing with my friends. I just wanted to be around horses, so... 
 Um, so I... I got into riding, really young, and then Ray took me on, real young. 
 I started working at the stable, training all the time, basically. 
 Yeah. 
 That's sort of like... like me with cars. 
 I... I always loved them. As soon as I looked under a hood and I saw that engine for the first time, it's like... it's weird. 
 I knew exactly where everything went, and what its function was, you know? It just made sense. 
 I feel that way about horses, like I... 
 A lot of people think they're so unpredictable, but I've never found it that way. 
 More than that, I mean, I just really like making machines work better, you know? 
 Faster. It's like a real buzz. 
 Same as horseracing. 
 Yeah. 
 We have to go. 
 I'll tell her. 
 Alice? 
 Hey, we're heading out. Everything all right? 
 Yep. 
 Yep, it's all good. 
 Cool. 
 Shh... 
 (Indistinct sports commentary) 
 (Moaning) 
 What? 
 (Muffled speech) 
 I can't... I can't breathe! 
 Oh, thanks, pal. I can't breathe, man. 
 I'm suffocating. 
 Okay, you don't speak, got it? 
 Hey, pal, I could make you some easy money. 
 What'd I just tell you? 
 I'm gonna put that gag back in your mouth. 
 No, seriously, I know who's gonna win the next race. 
 How do you know that? 
 Acid Chevrons. 
 I fixed it. 
 I got a bookie you can call. 
 That tip will pay you 40 to 1. 
 Come on, pal, it's easy money. 
 I said no thanks. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Oh, not, it's really... it's no problem. 
 Where are we? 
 Uh, just at a gas station. Frank's filling up. 
 Okay. Uh, I'm just gonna go get some... 
 Yeah, yeah, sure. 
 Oh, you... 
 Oh, I'm not feeling good. 
 Will you shut the f*ck up, please? 
 No, seriously, I got type-1 diabetes. 
 You're full of sh1t. 
 I should've had my insulin. I haven't had it today. 
 I'm not joking. 
 Should've had it hours ago. 
 You don't want me going into a state of shock, do you? 
 Where is it? 
 What? 
 You're needle. Where is it? 
 Uh, it's in my pocket. 
 Left pocket. 
 Ah, thanks. I appreciate it, brother. 
 I'm not your brother. Shut the f*ck up. 
 There ain't nothing in here. 
 Argh! 
 I told you. 
 We're all set. Where's Alice? 
 What's the matter? 
 I found this in her bag. 
 (Car chirping) 
 What's the matter? 
 Where'd you get that from? 
 Found it in your bag. 
 You were going through my things? 
 No, it fell out. 
 So what is this? Performance enhancing drugs? Steroids? What? 
 No, of course not. 
 Well? 
 Remember how we told you that they were trying to kill Daksha? 
 They put the nails on the track and they poisoned his feed? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, they nearly succeeded. 
 It got into the feed, he colicked. 
 We've been treating him with banamine but he's still at risk. 
 What kind of a risk. 
 His heart. 
 Would that explain the twitching that I saw? 
 So that's medicine? 
 Yes. 
 Wouldn't this show up in a drug test or screening? 
 No, it's legal. He can race with it in his system. 
 Why didn't you just tell us? 
 Because Ray didn't want anyone to know. 
 Why not? 
 Because... he's not 100%. 
 The vet says he's clear, but... 
 I know this horse. He's not himself. 
 But he's well enough to race. 
 Daksha could be the first horse in nearly 40 years to win the Triple Crown, or... 
 Either that or the race could kill him. 
 And you're willing to take that chance? 
 It's Ray's decision. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Mr. Martin, it's Ray Henson. 
 My guard's in hospital. Sans escaped. 
 When? 
 It's kind of hard to say. 
 My guy's still unconscious. 
 Okay. 
 Mr. Martin. 
 Yep. Howard Vorchek is definitely behind this. You said you suspected as much. But now I'm sure. He made me a rather interesting offer, fixing the odds on the computerized bets, if I let Snow Clash win tomorrow. What'd you say? I refused, naturally. Okay. Thanks for the heads up. (Phone ringing) Where the hell are you? I got a little tied up, but I'm on the road now. On the road where? Outside Philly. You mean you haven't even stopped this transporter yet? I got guys checking the interstate, but he must be sticking to back roads. Do you know what time it is? It's less than 12 hours until the race. I'll stop 'em. Well, I hope you do. And before he gets to New York City, or I'm gonna be out 20 million. Don't you worry, Mr. Vorchek. He can't stay on back roads forever. What's that supposed to mean? It means if we want to stop this guy, I'm gonna need more resources. How much longer do you think until we get there? Should be in the city in about an hour. We'll be on time then. Early, even. Will you be all right to race? You haven't got much sleep. I'll be okay. How about him? I don't know. Sometimes I really think I'm doing the wrong thing, racing him. I keep asking myself, you know, am I doing it for Ray? She's put everything into it. Am I doing it for me? Or am I doing it for... for Daksha? I mean, he's... he's born to run this race. I guess that's what you meant earlier when you talked about how hard it is, being selfish, sometimes. We've got a problem. What? It's just construction. It's a setup. Sans? sh1t. How did he know we'd be here? We couldn't take these back roads forever. We knew that. Well, let's just blow past 'em. I can't. Not without risking injury to the horse. So you're just stopping? Uh-huh... Well, hello, Mr. Fancy Pants. Let's step outside, with your hands in the air. (Gunshots) Frank! Alice, come on! Get the horse! You come with me! Hands in the air. Do it now or I'll blow her brains out. Well, if you put it that way. I should just kill you now, after the ass-whupping you gave me. Your call. All in good time. Now I need you it bring me the horse, and no tricks this time. If you please. Mind if I just get the keys out of my pocket? Careful. Woo! Let's go. Come on! (Gunshots) Hold up! Okay! Whoa... Whoa, whoa... I can't believe you just did that. Yeah, neither can I. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. That's amazing. Thank you so much. Yeah. You saved him. You're okay, right? It's just he's got a bit of a... bit of discharge. Is that... is that bad? I don't know... You okay, boy? Let's get him back to the truck. Okay... Jump on. Ray : Alice, where are you? Alice : We're just outside New York. Oh, good, you're close. Everything all right? Not exactly. Well, what is it? It's Daksha. What happened? Is he hurt? No, no, nothing like that. We got him away from Sans and his men, but he's just not well, Ray. I know it. Well, sure he is. You gave him his medicine, didn't you? Yes, I did, but he's not well. Alice, you cannot lose your nerve now, not after all we've been through. I'm not losing my nerve, Ray, okay? I'm just telling you you have a choice. We can forfeit this race, or you can kill this animal. Either way, you lose. I don't like those choices. What does Mr. Martin say? She wants to know what you have to say? Ah, he's looking good, Jeff. Oh, you beastie! Looking good! Good work, Jeff. A beautiful horse, Howard. You don't deserve him. You lookin' to change your mind, Ray? Not exactly. Sans must've told you by now. Daksha eluded his clutches. Well, I don't see him here. He's on his way now. But I thought you might be interested in hearing my plan first. What sort of plan is that? Well, I believe that Daksha's gonna win Belmont, and so do you, and I'm not gonna sacrifice that, not for all the money in the world. Well, then we got nothing to talk about. Maybe. Maybe not. But maybe his victory could also be yours. What are you talking about? Place your big bet on Daksha to win. You want me to bet against my own horse? You expected me to bet against mine. The odds aren't as good, but they're still good. We could both make a lot of money. Think about it. Not much time left. Well? We have a deal, thanks to you. Amazing. So what do we do now? Celebrate your defeat. Hm. Excuse me. Where you going? I have some business to attend to. I'll be back. (Playing harmonica) Well, well... I hear your boss and mine have come to an understanding. I guess this concludes our business. It does. This is just for fun. Sit down. Commentator : That's right, Sally, the horses and jockeys are lining up, getting ready to take their positions at the gate. Also getting ready for the starting bell on this legendary 1 ½-mile track known as the "test of the champion." Sally : That's right, Bob. The crowd is still reeling from the news just seconds ago that Daksha, the n°1 favourite and potential Triple Crown winner, has withdrawn due to health concerns. Bob : Any details on that? (Phone ringing) Sally : Not much, but all we know is... This is the call I've been waiting for. Excuse me. Bob : Well, we'll keep you posted as the details come in. Hello, Howard. You know what you've done? Do you know what you've done?! I'm ruined! And so are you! Come on, lesser people than us have lost and remade fortunes before, Howard. Ray, you're a fool. Yeah, well, maybe so. But cheer up. Your horse is about to win the Belmont Stakes. Ah, shut your head. So, thank you. For everything. You're welcome. Good luck. So how's he doing? He's faster than ever. Do you regret it? I mean, you could've won the Triple Crown. Well... This is just a trophy, right? Well... you really surprised me there. All that talk about competing and winning, you gave it up. Well... I guess there's different kinds of winning, right? Yeah. You were great at riding, by the way. Come on. No, seriously, you had good form. Really? I could barely stay on the thing. I feel like I could teach you to ride. Yeah. I think I'd really like that. Next time I'm in Kentucky, then. Yeah. Next time. Bye, Alice. Goodbye, Jules. ♪
