 "12 Hours" ("12 Heures Pour Survivre") 
 Nanotechnology is now manipulating matter on an atomic and molecular scale. 
 Rousseau's 3400 nanotube is ready. 
 The 3400 is the next breakthrough technology. 
 Nanotube applications... air filters, bone healing, and cancer treatment are just three of the medical applications of Rousseau's groundbreaking nanotube. To ensure that the inventor of future generations continue to advance technology, Rousseau will now partner with Kung Industries. It's with a great deal of gratitude and hope for the future that we announce this agreement between Kung Industries and Rousseau Electronics for commercial development in this breakthrough nanotube technology. [ tires screeching ] We are also indebted to the Committee for Open Trade  in Brussels and the Chinese Government  for their unprecedented help in this international co-production. Without co-operation and mutual respect, co-productions of this kind are untenable. We thank all the parties. Brakes are good. Shocks perfect. Well done, Dieter. [ Dieter whispers something ] What's that? Nothing. I'm glad you're happy. Thought I heard a bit of a whine around about 7,000 RPM. You might want to look into that. No, that was me. Oh. All good, then. So. So? Out. Here? I've got a job to do. You want me to call you a cab? No. Thanks again, Dieter. You're the best. sh1t. ♪ I get up at seven, yeah ♪ 
♪ and I go to work at nine ♪ 
♪ I got no time for living, yeah ♪ 
♪ I'm working all the time. ♪ 
♪ Seems to me I could live my life ♪ 
♪ a lot better than I think I am ♪ 
♪ I guess that's why they call me ♪ 
♪ they call me the working man. ♪ 
♪ They call me the working man ♪ 
♪ I guess that's what I am ♪ Three years behind schedule. The graphenation process... I've heard all the excuses, Mr. Rousseau. I just want to know, does it work? The CVD tech guarantees uniform nanotube delivery of lengths of up to 30cm. When can I expect delivery? The first microchips have already been fabricated. You can have them now. Your delays have impacted an entire generation of missile development. I hope, for your sake, that these expensive little tubes work. Carson. Uh... You know Mr. Kung. Only by reputation. Mr. Rousseau was just explaining the, uh, medical applications of the nanotube technology. Who knows how many lives can be saved with the cures that these little tubes will carry, huh? Carson is one of my closest collaborators. Our biggest breakthroughs would not have been possible had it not been for his help. Will you excuse us for a moment? Of course. What are you doing? He shouldn't be here while we're running the ohmic threshold testing. And "collaborator"? This is my work! Carson... we developed this together. I'm in a meeting here! Kung is talking about  backing out. We need his help. How many times do I have to go through this with you? I take care of the business side so you can be the mad scientist. I don't like him. He's not my favourite person either. But we love his money. Is there a problem, Mr. Rousseau? I have a flight to catch. No, no. I just... My colleague was just asking a technical question. I'll see you in the main lab. So... My associate wishes to know how you plan to ship the chip. The microchip is frozen and encased in an electron-neutral shell. Other governments are aware of this work. The English are close, and the Russians. I don't want any surprise breakthroughs. I paid for this technology. It belongs to me. There will be no problems. "Medical applications." "Who knows how many lives will be saved?" Kung, you fraud. You have a stone where there should be a heart. You think that I'm stupid? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. A major-general in the Chinese army. You son of a bitch! I know who you really are. What do you want? You're not a medical researcher. I beg your pardon? Weapons development... bombs! You should ask your boss about that. You'll never get it. There's one prototype. It's mine. You will never see it! I suggest you calm yourself. Carson. What's going on? Oh, Mr. Bernhardt and I were just discussing how excited we are being in business together. Good night, gentlemen. What are you doing? I won't allow this, Armand. I won't allow this. You have a problem, Mr. Rousseau. Don't let it become my problem. Why, Armand?  What happened to us? [ ringing on other end ] Man : Hello? Uh... it's Carson Bernhardt. Yes, the moral industrialist. Calling to lecture me again? Or perhaps you have changed your mind? There is something I need to know. If I sell you the microchip... do you swear that it will be put to the use that I intended? Your partner is selling micro-tech that's 20 times [i]faster than anything that exists... to the Chinese. They're not making computer games. At least if you sell it to me, the weapons Mr. Kung will develop with this technology will be deterred. That's all I can promise. The fate of the world, Mr. Bernhardt, on your shoulders. [ phone beeps ] [ music ] [ phone ringing ] What? All right, Frank, client number 2236. Pickup is a winery outside Nice. Sending coordinates. Where's the drop-off? Information withheld. Package specs? Information withheld. How will I know the client? Information withheld. Am I allowed to know anything about this job? They've requested you be clean-shaven. Are you, Frank? Information withheld. Bye, Carla. [ phone beeps ] You're late. Punctuality. I-I like that. I like that. Um... but I suppose in your line of work it's a necessity? Is that the package? What the hell is this? Just keep quiet. Don't move from that spot. Don't move. What did you just do? I injected a... a capsule into your neck. Inside the capsule is the package... a microchip. You should be aware that it is very valuable. I didn't agree to this. The buyer is going to meet you in Geneva, and he will remove the capsule. The mode of transport should make it easier to get across the border. No. Rule number one: never change the deal. I was, uh, I was afraid that if I told you beforehand, you... would not have agreed. Damn right I wouldn't. Which is also why inside the capsule are a few drops of a deadly toxin. If you try to remove it, the capsule will break, releasing the poison, killing you. The buyer has a vial of antidote like this. When you get to Geneva, he will remove the capsule and administer this antidote. There's one more thing you need to know. The capsule was designed to dissolve in 12 hours. Once that time is up, you will have approximately 3 minutes to get antidote into your system. All this is simply to say that it's in your best interest to complete the transport in a timely manner. Whew. Good luck. Twelve hours and the capsule dissolves, killing me. Poison? You think  he's telling the truth? I'm not waiting around to find out. The buyer has the antidote. Twelve hours should give me enough time to get to him. Frank... I'll talk to you later. Frank! [ girls laughing ] Yes. Have a nice ride. [ girls laughing ]  Good bye, mister! Afternoon. Remove your glasses. Destination? Geneva. What purpose? Visiting a friend. For how long? Today only. Driving back tonight. Such a short visit. He's not a good friend. You are being funny? No, sir. Because I have no time for jokes. I can see that. [ guard sniffing ] You are bringing meat with you? No, no meat. Pull over for further inspection. Why? Pull over for further inspection. [ in TV ] You're live on the air with Carl the Car Guy. Giles is our special in-studio guest. We're talking Formula One and weight regulations, and you had a special observation. Yeah, the whole thing is bullshit. It's not about fuel economy or safety. Well, then why do you think the FIA put the turbo ban in place? 'Cause a bunch of whining little girls are scared of the big turbos! Well, I mean, come on, these are legitimate concerns. I mean these big motors were spitting out, what, close to a thousand horsepower! That's what I mean! That's why they call it racing! So there's no room for safety in your mind? The only people that talk about safety are pussies. Step out of the car. Leave the keys. I'm going to have to move things along. Everybody wants to be Ayrton Senna, but nobody wants to go fast. Wah! Babies! Asshole. Hi, you're on the air. Who're we talking to? Hello, my name is Dieter Haussmann, and the other caller is full of sh1t. Ah, looks like we've got ourselves a debate. Guys, I'm going to hook you in together here on the air, let you fight it out on the air! There you are, guys, go ahead, it's all yours! Who is this? A man who knows about cars, which is more than I can say about you. Have you ever raced, Dieter Haussmann? Yeah, I ran a pit crew at Le Mans in 2002 and 2003. What kind of car do you drive? I drive a... You see? Little bitches, all of you. "I wanna be Ayrton Senna, but my mommy von't let me take the car." Hey, don't talk about Ayrton Senna like this, yeah? Oh, another Ayrton Senna fanboy. Do you have a picture of him in his '89 McLaren MP4? A little poster up on your wall? Hey, f*ck you, asshole! He drove the MP4 in '88. In '89 he drove the MP4/5! Ha! Ha! Ha! Fanboy! You want to talk about this, you full of sh1t? Come to my shop. Laugh at me then, yeah? That's a good idea, Dieter Haussmann in Nice. I'll call on my way. f*ck you. Oh, I think he hung up. That was great. Giles, thanks very much, and, uh, Dieter, I think I'd keep my eyes wide open down at the shop! You were supposed to check in 48 minutes ago. Slight delay at the border. I'm en route  to the drop-off point now. Are you the transporter? No, I was just hoping you could give me directions to the lake. I was expecting you much sooner. Bit of a delay at the border crossing. Were you carrying meat? You know they're real particular about that. Do you have the antidote? What are you doing? You're a loose end. Remove the package. Make sure the capsule breaks. I want to see that this toxin is as effective as advertised. On the ground. Get on the ground! Mind if I take off my jacket first? Go ahead. Although... I don't know why you care. 'Cause you're going to be f*ckin' dead in a minute. [ gunshots ] Damn it. [ dialling ] [ cell phone ringing ] [ ringing on other end ] [ phone beeps ] It's Carson Bernhardt.  The deal should be done by now. And the second half of the payment is not in my account. I held up my end. You hold up yours. I'm afraid a deposit won't be possible right now. Your colleague is somewhat indisposed. Who is this? It's the transporter. Your contact changed the deal. I don't like changing the deal. Any leads on getting this thing out of my neck? Look, I know some people  from my days with SCI who might be able to help  remove the capsule.  It's probably our best bet since you killed the buyer. He tried to kill me first. Anyway, I think the guy who can help us lives close to Nice. Are you still in Geneva? Yeah. How much time do you have left? Just over five hours. No time to drive back. You have to leave the car there and fly. I'm already on my way to the airport. 
 
 [ cell phone ringing ] Andre? Carla. How did you know it was me? I do voice recog, remember? Amongst your other specialities. I take it you need something. I have a friend with a medical condition. That's not really my field. What kind of medical condition? He has a device planted in his neck. And you want me to do what? Remove it? It's tricky, but yes. It's some kind of a microchip. I would need to learn more about it. We're on our way. How did you know I... hello? Carla? Good talk. [ engine revving ] [ timer ringing ] [ cell phone ringtone ] Yes, hello? Dieter. Oh, Frank, I'm about to have lunch. I'm sorry to interrupt. Where are you? Switzerland. Oh, sorry to hear that. I hope you didn't bring any meat with you. I'm about to leave the car at the Aeroport Internationale de Geneve. No! NO! Out of the question. The Swiss are thieves. They will offer you chocolate with one hand, and steal your wallet with the other. I'm flying to Nice. Call Carla. Make sure she meets me with a car  on the landing pad. Frank, you cannot leave a German car in Switzerland. This is common sense. I don't have a choice here. [ Dieter sighs. ] OK, listen, at the very least park it somewhere it won't attract attention... in a secluded forest under a pile of leaves, perhaps. Dieter, it'll be at the airport. I'll talk to you later. Frank, wait. Frank... Got to go, Dieter. Listen, I may have started something. Sorry, my friend, but I don't have time for this right now. I need your help, Frank. I'll call you when I arrive. [ phone beeps ] What do you mean, the 3400's missing? It was signed out under the right access code. I don't give a f*ck about access codes! I... We can recall all the key cards. I will do it myself. Frank : Who is this guy? Andre Breitbart, boy genius recruited straight out of MIT. CIA, DIA... Why him? He'll be more interested in the chip than in you. And that's a good thing? Yes, Frank. He won't want to damage it, so he won't break the capsule. And you might live. You're right. That is a good thing. [ cell phone ringtone ] Yes, hello. Hello, Dieter. I'm on my way to see you. [ sighs ] sh1t! Carson. I thought about what you said, and you're right. About too many people coming into the lab. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's too much, Armand. We don't want to contaminate... I'll need your card. We should limit access until we finish the... nanotube beta tests. I need access, it's my project. Oh, of course, of course, but we are recalling all the cards. I'll need your old one. We need to be careful. Word of our work is getting out. If that tech got stolen... Yeah. It could be very dangerous in the wrong hands. We need to be in this together. We  are  in this together, aren't we, Bernhardt? You always said we were. There is the capsule. It's too small. I need more detail. There. Inside the capsule. The package. Astonishing. A microchip built using nanotubes. It's electrode distribution. Instead of moving individual electrons, it fires them in a stream. But the capsule? Holy sh1t. It is degrading. I don't know if I can get it out without releasing the poison. Then let's try another approach. I've got less than two hours. We need to find that antidote. You've checked all the access cards? Check them again. Specifically when he used it to access the lab. [ knocking on door ] [ Carson sighs. ] Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait. I'm sorry, but it can't wait. Rousseau wants to see you. Yeah. Yeah. [ cell phone ringtone ] [ phone beeps ] Carla : Pretty big complex. Thousands of employees in Nice. Ah, Armand Rousseau, Founder and CEO. Brilliant mind, but he's a prick. A huge prick. Frank : Wait. Back it up. There. He's the client. Andre : The one who injected the microchip into you? Carla : Carson Bernhardt, Vice President. Andre : Holy sh1t. It must be an inside job! Get me the address. You're not even sure he has the vials with him. Well, if they're not, he certainly knows where they are. I'm coming with you. No. There isn't much time left. Carla... this is the way it is, what you signed on for when we first made this arrangement. You find the jobs, negotiate payment, and I carry them out. Alone. He's ready for you now. Have a seat. One of the, uh, prototypes is missing. Which one? The 3400. Missing? What? What do you mean? Stolen? I believe so. By who? You. Do you think I'm stupid enough to do something like that? Ten years ago, no. I would have trusted you with my life. But... people change. Yeah. They forget about the people that helped them through the trouble. They forget about people who helped them... get where they are today! Is that what this is about? You feel unappreciated? Who approached you? Or was this something you thought of on your own? Because that is the point that I am not sure of. Were you helping a rival? Huh? You're ambitious, I'll give you that. Maybe... they promised you a job? Or you were in it for just the money? f*ck you. The 3400 is the turning point of this company... of this entire industry! I worked very hard on it... You worked hard? You worked hard for this? Are you kidding me? You put up roadblocks every stage of development. And now I know why! You've been working for Kung the whole time! No. I was hoping that we could discuss this matter without removing you from the project. I guess... I was wrong. No, no. Ahhh! I've got him. Sir, please come with me. Can I help you? I need to speak with Carson Bernhardt. He's unavailable right now. It's urgent. I'm sorry, who are you? Someone Mr. Bernhardt will definitely want to talk to. May I have your name? What are you doing? You can't go in there! I'm calling security. Look. Trust me, Mr. Bernhardt will understand once he sees me. But I need to speak to him right now. And I'm telling you that's not possible. Excuse me. What are you doing? You can't go in there. Mr. Rousseau? Mr. Rousseau? Hmm. Carson Bernhardt, was he here? Security's on the way. Was he here? Yes, he left. Where'd he go? I don't know. He went over to the main lobby. Mr. Rousseau? [ secretary screaming ] Hey! You can't be in here! This is the clean room. [ bones crunching ] Ah! Ah! man : Ahhh! Sorry. [ engine revving ] [ revving continues ] Carla,  I'm right on him.  We're on Gemenos road. I've got you, Frank. sh1t. [ tires screeching ] [ timer beeping ] [ timer beeping ] [ timer beeping ] [ timer beeping continuously ] Where's the antidote? I can't give it to you. Where is it?! This technology can't fall into the wrong hands. Rousseau is dead. He can't do anything now. Just give me the antidote. No. The technology must be destroyed. It dies with you. [ screams ] [ hit on ground ] [ shot of air ] [ melancholy music ] A bit of cleaning, and... Hey. How are you feeling? Mm... I've been better. Did you get it out? It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing. Such a little thing. Shakespeare? Tolkien. Lord of the Rings Volume One: Fellowship of the Ring. Carla : Of course. This is the future, my friends. What're you going to do with it? Technology is actually a brilliant communications tool. I was thinking we could donate it to the London Nuclear Disarmament Centre. I'm sure they could find something interesting to do with it. I leave it in your capable hands. [ cell phone ringing and vibrating ] Excuse me. Hello, Inspector. Frank, I'm standing outside the office of Armand Rousseau. Do you know who he is? I've heard of him, yes. Uh... perhaps you know that he is dead? Murdered. Really? Any suspects? There are witnesses who say a man  fitting your description went into Rousseau's office shortly before his body was discovered. I have yet to review the surveillance video. Have you asked those witnesses about Carson Bernhardt? Carson Bernhardt? One of Rousseau's vice presidents. There are rumours about him possibly selling company secrets to rivals. Ah, motive. I will speak with Mr. Bernhardt. He drives a Lamborghini. It's fairly easy to spot. Especially if it was just sitting there at the side of the road. A road such as...? Oh, I don't know. Probably one less travelled. Gemenos, maybe. Gemenos, yes? Find the Lamborghini you'll find him... and probably blood evidence linking him to Rousseau's death. Thank you, Frank. I will check into this immediately. Let me know if I can be any further assistance. Ah, of course. [ phone beeps ] Feeling OK? Fine. Sure you don't want me to drive? Never mind. [ music ] [ door closing ] [i]You Dieter? Uh, Dieter is not here. Is he coming back? Or did he go to his Ayrton Senna fan club meeting? Dieter's got good taste. Can't wait to talk to him. So... [ opens a bottle of beer. ] ...you a Senna fan as well as your boss? Because I think Senna... was chickenshit. You hear me, Dieter? Dieter? Uh, Dieter is not here. You gonna introduce me? Who the f*ck are you? Dieter. Dieter Haussmann. What? I apologize for what I said  on the radio. So, uh...  why don't I buy you a few beers? You don't sound like Dieter. I know. I sound different on the phone. I didn't like what you said. So why don't you go and get yourself some beers? Tell your pal to put down the wrench. He's making me nervous. You're not such a pussy after all, Dieter. Thanks. [ door opening and closing ] Got any more of these? He got the last one. That's a pain in the neck. Yeah. Come on. I'll buy you dinner. I was ready for him, Frank. I just didn't want anything to happen to the car. I know, Dieter. I know...
