 "Cherchez La Femme"  ("Double Jeu") 
 So where's your boyfriend today? 
 I thought you were having another hot date. 
 Got postponed. He had to run. 
 [ panting ] 
 [ woman grunting ] 
 Enough! 
 Are you gonna run again? 
 I'll take that as a yes. 
 Ugh! Put me down! I'm not gonna run. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 You know where the Transporter is? If you act on the information, then my cover could be blown. That's why you got so close in the first place...  so we could use it when the time is right. That time... is now. He's driving a girl, Emily Casson, street name 'Jet', to the Château Carval in Villards sur Var. What time is he due to arrive? In an hour, and he's never late. Why did you run? They offered me a job, I said yes. Now, I've changed my mind, I don't want it. You make a deal, you should never change it. You know what? f*ck that! My arrangement is with the man who hired you. I've got a bad feeling. I'll pay you more to take me back. A deal is a deal. I deliver you. What happens after that is your problem. [ rock music in headphones ] [ cell phone ringing ] Man: Hello. I've sent an address. The girl will be there in 45 minutes. Kill her and anyone else who gets in the way. Right on time, I commend you, monsieur. Didier Carval... No names. Ah, very wise. And you must be Jet. They tell me she is the best hacker in France. Mademoiselle, very pleased to meet you. Do not. Just get this over with. Yes. Yes, of course. Not my place obviously. More a hideout really. I need to rearrange some funds. Think of it as a market correction. Is everything here I asked for? Yes. Where are the account numbers? On the desk. I managed to lose, well actually,  rather a lot of funds that belonged to the Scozzi family. I want to be paid. Of course. [ Jet typing quickly ] Anyhow, I gave them the usual warnings. The value of your investment can go down as well as up. As it turns out, the value went down. What is money these days, but numbers in a computer? And Jet is going to rearrange those numbers for me. You talk too much. She has a point. Let's just say I'm out of my comfort zone and spending far too much on security. But this... this is money well spent. Thank you. Frank. His name is Frank. Frank. Thanks, Frank. sh1t! [ gunshots ] What the f*ck is going on? They said I had till tomorrow, 9 AM, to get them the money. You are moving the money? Yes. - Come on, hurry up. Print it, I want to show them. Jesus, f*ck! Why don't they stop shooting? [ gunshots ] Ah! [ gunshots ] What the hell? No! No, that's not what we agreed. "Till tomorrow," you said. I've got your money back. What the f*ck are you doing? I'm here for the girl. Ugh! Ugh! Come out. Just close your eyes. Ugh! [ gunshot ] [ grunting ] You want to go home? You came back. Seems that way. Come on. You know how to use that thing? Go, go, go, go, go! [ gunshots ] Nice shot. [ quick automatic dialling ] [ phone ringing ]  Well? She got away. How? The Transporter. ♪ I get up at seven, yeah ♪ 
♪ and I go to work at nine ♪ 
♪ I got no time for living, yeah ♪ 
♪ I'm working all the time. ♪ 
♪ Seems to me I could live my life ♪ 
♪ a lot better than I think I am ♪ 
♪ I guess that's why they call me ♪ 
♪ they call me the working man. ♪ 
♪ They call me the working man ♪ 
♪ I guess that's what I am ♪ Next time I say I have a bad feeling maybe you should listen to me. There won't be a next time. [ beeping ] [i]Frank? Carla. How did it go? Got interesting. Interesting how? Some mobster's goons showed up  and killed the client. Frank, are you alright? Yeah. And the good news is he paid me before he went down. You are a hard man, Frank. Only when I have a lunch date. Anyone I know? Nope. Ohh, the mystery woman. When are you going to tell me about her, Frank? I'm not. Bye, Carla. Bye, Frank. Where can I drop you? I've pinged your GPS. Please don't do that. Why did you come back for me? I missed your winning personality. [ music ] Later, Frank. No, no, thank you... I didn't ask you to save me. I take care of myself. Nice work, Inspector. I'm glad you approve, Frank. She must be a very special lady... whoever she is. I think she might be. And here she is. She is very punctual. Now... I know why you like her so much. Oh! Ok. Thanks again, Inspector. You're a man of many talents, Frank. You must have been working on this all day. Only the best for you. Ah! Not the reaction I was hoping for. Give me any reason, I'll blow your head off. Who are you? [ phone ringing ] That's not important. Someone wants to talk to you. Hm. Yes? Frank? Do what they say... ...otherwise they're going to kill me. I'm sorry, Miss. Let's go. Frank... Don't worry. I'll call you. Hi, Mister Transporter. Carla's been good enough to lend me her office. Please don't try anything foolish. Your friend is in a very difficult position. What do you want? The hacker, Jet. I know you have her somewhere. You need to bring her to me... or Carla dies. That's the deal. I don't like blackmail. You have 4 hours. It's a deal. [ metal jingling ] [ handcuffs dropping on floor ] I'll be back for you. [ whimpering ] [ French hip hop ] I'm looking for a friend of mine. Does he wear a suit too? A suit's an ironic statement. Yeah? What is that? Things aren't always what they seem. This friend of mine, she's a girl about yay high, black hair, goes by the name of Jet. Friendly little soul. Proper ray of sunshine. You should go. I said get out of here. Jet! [ screams ] Oh, my god. David? [ gunshot impacts ] Get down! Ah! Ah! Let's get the hell out of here, come on. Are you all right?! Are you OK? [ gunshot impacts ] Just get me out of here. Ah! Ah! Just get me out of here! Get me out of here! Come on. Who's that? I can smell your perfume. Help me! Where are you going? Help me! What the hell are you doing? Since when did we kidnap people? We're at war, our enemies don't play by any rules. I'll do whatever it takes for national security. What does this have to do with national security? The hacker, Jet, she has hacked into our most secure systems. She's a terrorist. She's just a kid! With information that puts our entire intelligence network at risk. Every security threat is to be treated as a terrorist threat. You know the protocols. And what about her? She has nothing to do with any of this. We need your Transporter to bring the hacker here. I need leverage. I'm sorry about your friend. His name was David. The guys who killed him want you dead too. I need to know why. The DCRF had a file on him. French Intelligence? Yeah. He hacked the passport authority and got onto their radar. We went to the DCRF system to erase their file. We weren't the first ones in there. We got curious so we followed them...  to this guy. Edouard Orlande, deputy chief of the DCRF. He has bank accounts in Switzerland, the Caribbean,  fake names, secret passwords... and payments from people that he really, really shouldn't take money from. He knows you know... You signed your own death warrant. He obviously doesn't take chances. He's going to want us all dead. And we have 3 hours to rescue Carla. [ cell phone ringing ] Hi, Transporter. I've got the girl. Meet me at the market square at 3: 45. So now what? I'm gonna do something you would never do. What's that? Call the cops. Hm! Inspector. Frank. Inspector Tarconi, this is Jet. Miss.  She has social issues. No, I have cop issues. I often feel the same way. Jet is a hacker. She discovered information proving that a... DCRF chief is dirty. He wants her dead... and he's holding Carla hostage. The DCRF have people everywhere. You're right, this is very serious. Hm, you should try this. Marcel is a master. I've been coming here for years. When you find someone you trust... I take it you have a plan. What do you need? Access and a diversion in an hour. An hour? The Transporter is bringing the girl. You should go. I want to see the handover. It'd compromise your cover. Go home, Juliette. You'll have much to do later. Everything's arranged? Everyone's in position. [ car door slamming ] You can relax. Your man is bringing the package. Within an hour, you'll be free to go. My "man" won't let this go. You're going to be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. I doubt that. The minute we get the girl, kill all of them. Jet : If Tarconi's pass codes are good,  we own the traffic grid. [ beeping ] Woo! Ha! Ha! OK. Ready? Now! Alright! Woo! Ha! Remember you promised to delete those files when we're done. Yeah, I crossed my fingers. Will that laptop survive if I drive over it a few times? You know, you are a really angry man, Frank. Perhaps that's why your life is so complicated. The only reason my life is complicated right now is you. And Carla. Is she your lover? No. But you wish she was? No. Then why would you risk your life for hers? [ bell ringing ] We're all set. All fields of fire are open. Wait for my signal. Copy that. You're ready? Yeah. You remember the plan? Don't get shot. Just walk towards your friend. As soon as the girl gets to me, take the others out. What's Frank's plan? When the sh1t hits the fan, we run. That sounds just like Frank. He said you might not understand anything too complicated. Now that really sounds like Frank. 
 
 [ sirens ] Police! Do we take the shot? No. All mobile units,  make sure that the Transporter does not get away. Police! Everybody down! Where the f*ck have all these cops come from? cop : Throw your weapons! [ indistinct talking in French ] We can't let them cut us off. You follow the route, I'll deal with them. Hey, asshole! Are you mad!? Left, I need to go left... I got it, Frank, calm down. It's too close, Jet. Then drive faster, Frank. You two are so good together. I can always take you back, Carla. No thanks. Jet : Turn here, I'm going to try something. [ people chattering ] Who the f*ck are you? I have the same question for you, monsieur. Deputy Orlande, DCRF. And these are your men? Yes, of course. Ah... I see what happened. We had a report of armed men at the square. Someone makes a phone call... one cannot be too careful. So? So... So, what? Why are you here with all the snipers and firepower? Listen, Inspector, you've just screwed up a major intelligence operation, so I suggest that you stop asking me questions. Get your men out of the square before I have you directing traffic in the countryside! As you wish. Are we safe here? As safe as anywhere else. That's reassuring. Why wouldn't we be? Orlande got to me through you. He doesn't know where I live. My name isn't on the deeds to this place. Come on. It's nice. Thank you. I mean, a little square and old, but nice. Nice knives! When Edouard came to my office, he already knew about that job. I would never give up your name and location. You know that. Maybe they hacked your system. Unless... someone already told them something? You have a point, Carla? You know what I'm talking about. What about your mystery woman? Has she been here? Leave her out of this. She's got nothing to do with any of it. You're sure you two aren't lovers? It's more a brother/sister thing. If Juliette wanted to betray me she's had ample opportunity, why would she do it now? [ cell phone ringing ] You know, I could care less about your love life, but how well do you really know her? It's Tarconi. They're on the move again, Frank. Maybe it's time to consider coming in. All of you. I can protect you here. No. I need room to work. sh1t! What? It's Juliette. What is she doing here? I don't know. Don't let her in. I have to say something. The last time she saw me I had a gun pointed at my head. Seems to be quite the regular occurrence. It's the company I keep. Get out back, I'll deal with this. Oh, my god! You're here! You OK? Why didn't you call me? Who were those guys on the beach? It was a misunderstanding. About what? It's best you don't know. I had a gun pointed at me too. I know, I know. I'm sorry about that. We should go inside. [ Click! ] Talk to me. I can help. If I thought you could help, I would talk to you. We have to trust each other. This is something you don't want to be involved in. You don't trust me? I should go. Juliette... I'll call you... when I get this sorted out. Maybe you shouldn't. Well? They are all there. Good work, Juliette. [ Jet typing ] [ Frank sighing ] You know how to pick them, Frank. Juliette's not the problem. You bought her Caron's Poivre perfume? Classy! Frank : So what? When I was at that warehouse, a woman was there wearing that perfume. I'd know it anywhere because you buy me a bottle every birthday. Wait a minute, forget the perfume. So your girlfriend's a cop? You knew. I didn't know she worked for French Intelligence. Edouard : We'll take it from here, Juliette. You will take them alive? I told you we would. We're gonna have to trust each other, Juliette. Go. Do it. Frank : Let's go. Run! Run! Carla!? Carla, Jet! Anything moves, kill it. You guys, OK? Carla : Yeah, I guess. You OK? Come on, let's go! Head for the bedroom. [ woman coughing ] I need you to hide. Frank, you're bleeding! It's nothing. We should get out. No. This ends here. Get behind that thing. f*ck 'em up, Frank! I intend to. Ugh! Argh! Time to go. There will be more of them. OK, let's go. OK, into the car. Get behind the car. Argh! Ah! Ah! Ah! [ commando moaning ] Ugh! You know your boss is dirty, right? You're not the target, Transporter. Then your rocket must have hit my house by accident. [ commando grunting ] Ah! Aaaah! One down, one to go. You don't even know where to find Edouard. I know someone who does. Stay here. I loved that f*cking house. He's so badass. He's gonna get himself killed. Can you trace his phone? I can hack a computer that can. Do it. Inspector Tarconi? It's Carla. Frank. Surprised... to see me alive? No. Just relieved. Really? No one else at the DCRF will be. The DCRF wanted me to infiltrate the Transporter network. Well, you certainly accomplished that. It started as a job... And What? Became something else? The hacker, Jet, she's a terrorist! I couldn't let her... That's bullshit, and you know it. Now sit the f*ck down! She's just a f*cked up kid who sticks her nose in where she shouldn't. And this time it was the DCRF and your boss, Orlande. How do you know that name? The girl found it, tracking dirty money and agency cover-ups. Impossible. And it all leads back to Orlande. No. Why do you think he wanted us all dead? And why did he send you in after us? Because he's dirty, corrupt. You've been working for this prick all along. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I-I never meant to... Never meant for what? For us? For us to go so far? I was just a job? It started like this... They blew up my f*cking house! I know, and I'm sorry. He said they were just going to arrest you. My feelings for you are real. Your feelings? I don't want to hear any of it. I don't want to hear one f*cking word about your feelings. You're going to hear it, OK? Because you and me... we find it hard to trust... to let someone in. Because of what we are. I'm here for Orlande's location. That's the only reason I'm here. I will take you there. [ music ] [ indistinct words in French ] Ugh! Ah! Is it just the two of you? You need an explanation? Why did you blow up the Transporter's house? I know, Juliette... you feel betrayed. As do I! Ah! Ah! Frank! Mr. Martin, you're a very hard man to kill. Let her go and you can try again. In the end, I'm disappointed. We had a good game, but you underestimated me. I cover every base. I knew that Juliette harboured true feelings, so I had her watched, and here we are. Well, that's all very interesting... but I don't care about her. OK. Where do you f*cking people come from? Drop the gun! You're under arrest! For what? I'm the deputy chief of the DCRF in a warehouse assaulted by a group of terrorists! Tarconi : That's enough! Let her go and drop the gun! No, Inspector, I'm leaving. We don't have all day. Oh! [ Edouard grunting ] Please, no. No. Don't do it. Please don't. Please. Please. Don't make me... Please don't. Please. [ scream ] [ crash ] [ Carla gasps. ] Now might be a good time for you all to leave. Except Juliette, who I will need to talk to her superiors... I'm afraid... I'm going to have to paint myself as a hero. Go for it. Well at least no one can put a gun to my head out here. [ water scooter drives by ] Ah! [ Juliette laughing ] [ cell phone ringing ] You think we're jinxed? [ laughing ] I'm off duty.
