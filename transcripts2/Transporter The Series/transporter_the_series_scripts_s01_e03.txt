 "The General's Daughter" 
 [ phone ringing ] 
 [ beep ] 
 Hello, Carla. How are you this morning? 
 Where's the drop off? 
 You're in a good mood. 
 Things haven't started going wrong yet. Nothing's going to go wrong. You shouldn't have said that. Now I'm not in a good mood. Thanks. I'm here to help. Sending coordinates now. It looks like a parking garage. How do you handle all this glamour, Frank? It's about the journey, not the destination. Are you quoting Carla Bruni again? Why, are you jealous? Can I help you? You know you're killing the ozone layer, leaving your engine running like this? I don't suppose you've ever considered switching to a natural-gas-powered car like mine? Wonderful Another gas guzzler. Whoa! What the f*ck? [ gunfire ] [ tires screeching ] Ah! Why are they shooting? Ah! Ah! [ tires screeching ] What the f*ck? What's going on? Ah! Ah! Ah! Thanks. [ tires screeching ] Oh, my god! Ah! Let me out! What the hell is going on? Who were those guys? Seatbelt. sh1t. [ gunfire ] [ tires screeching ] Ah! What are you doing? [ tires screeching ] [ crash ] Look what you've done to my car! [ men yelling ] Sorry about your car. Maybe next time try electric. [ tires screeching ] [ phone ringing ] What? Looks like the drop site's been compromised. No delivery, then. They still want the package, Frank. I should throw it in the river. I'm sending you new coordinates. Where is it? Trunk. Sorry for the last-minute change, but, uh... these things happen. Bon. I guess this concludes our business. Except for one thing. Rule number 1: never change the deal. ♪ I get up at seven, yeah ♪

Just, uh, there was an incident in a parking garage. Sounds fascinating. Why don't you come inside and we'll discuss it? Now, about this incident? Ah, yes. An... unfortunate thing. Um... drug gangs. Someone trying to steal the merchandise, and someone trying to stop them. I don't suppose you know anything about it? - No. There was a witness. Oh. Then you should talk to him. It was a "her". Or perhaps you knew it was a "her" and you were trying to bluff me. Huh? Enfin... I'm not sure how reliable her story is. I had the feeling she was leaving something out. Hm. Ah, young people today. [ cell phone ringing ] Ah, another business trip? [ cell phone ringing ] Hi, sweetheart. Girlfriend. [i]Don't try to sweet-talk me, Frank. The client wants to press assault charges. That's very nice of him. Tell him I'll have lunch with him anytime. Can you make it to Berlin in seven hours? Seems a bit hasty, but, uh,  your mother insists, I don't see why not. OK. I'm getting details when we confirm. Did she say whether it was black tie? Frank, you can wear a clown suit, as far as I'm concerned. Bye, darling. Inspector, any idea where I can rent a tuxedo? Good afternoon. I just got coordinates  for the pickup. Hotel Gendermenmarkt. I'm also sending you a photo. This the contact? That's the package. The client wants to make sure she gets out of Berlin safely. And I'm told the photo's not so recent,  so she might look a little different. [ ding! ] [ knocking on door ] You must be the chauffeur. [ cell phone ringtone ] Hey, what's happening? Yeah, I'm not in a rush. Ugh. No, I can't. Yeah, I gotta go meet my Dad. He's already sent me a driver. I don't know. No, he's been acting pretty weird lately actually. Excuse me, miss. I'm on a schedule here. Look, I'm gonna have to get back to you, OK? Bye. So, let's go. [ ding! ] [ ding! ] OK, my bags are at the front. I'll just be a minute. OK, come on. ♪ Take it all down, baby♪ 
♪ Watch it go around ♪ 
♪ On a slow ride ♪ 
♪ Now's your time to play ♪ 
♪ Take it right down, baby ♪ 
♪ Won't you hold down, baby ♪ 
♪ Gotta slow that up ♪ 
♪ Take your pain away ♪ Room service. ♪ Take it all down, baby ♪

♪ Now's your time to play ♪ 
♪ Take it right down, baby ♪ 
♪ Won't you hold down, baby ♪ 
♪ Gotta slow that up ♪ 
♪ Take your pain away ♪ Can I help you? Where is she? Oh, I think that's the girl from the change room, but I... Oh. What do you think? Too much? It's very pretty. I'll try on something else. Don't go. I'm gonna need a man's opinion. Very nice. Yes? [ She gasps. ] Shh. [ man speaking German ] woman : You can't do that. You can't go though. Get your hands off me. Stop it! Oh! [ man speaking German ] Come on. Get this on. I'm just gonna be a minute. Ahhh! Come on. What? Hey, who is going to clean this up? [ camera clicks ] [ camera clicks ] I can get him right now. He has the girl. We've got everything we need. Document his movements. That's all you're authorized to do. Do we want him or not? You're not authorized to take any further action. What? Who has the power to veto an international arrest warrant? The Americans. The general is their asset. Let them deal with him. And the connections? Stay out of it. That's an order. What the hell is going on? Who were those guys? You must've really done something to piss them off. This is not about me. They were after you. What? I was hired to get you out of Berlin and drive you to a safe house. And that's what I'm gonna do. Herr Trumpf, she had a man with her, some kind of bodyguard. Police were out front before these three could get out of the hotel. What do you think we Germans are known for these days, hmm? I mean, beside the obvious... Hitler, and wearing socks with our sandals. Reliability. Give us a task, we show up on time and finish on budget. The world may not love us, but they do need us, as long as we deliver. Because if we don't, we lose our right to exist, you know, and our culture dies with us. I need a doctor. Ugh! Not anymore. Do you need a doctor? I'm not very happy about this. It may be time to get a little more aggressive. [ she sighs. ] [ she sighs. ] How long have I been asleep? Couple hundred kilometres. [ sighs ] What's your name? Rule number 2: no names. Rule number two? How many rules are there? What does your father do for a living? He was a general in the US Army. What is it? Retired generals don't usually have the kind of money that attracts kidnappers. Yeah, well, now he's a consultant. Just does a lot of big deals with government contractors, military agencies. Last week he was at a conference with the President of France. Dad. Delia. It's good to see you again. Come on inside, let's get you cleaned up. Come in. What is going on? Your father didn't talk to you? Yeah, right. He said he wanted to spend time with me and he'd send a driver, and now I'm running for my life. I'm sorry, who is that guy? He's a transporter. Look, I'm your father's personal assistant, but that doesn't mean that he tells me everything. Whatever. He's been distracted lately. I thought he might be worried about you. Ha! I doubt it. All I am to him is a yearly birthday call and a monthly cheque. Hey, that's not true. You know it is. You've taken better care of me the last couple of years than he has. Look, if you want to know what this is all about, you're really going to have to ask him, OK? Right now I can't trust anyone in my own organization. That much I already know. Three guys tried to take Delia before I could get her out of the hotel They knew exactly where to find her. You've got a leak. That's what I was afraid of. Whatever you're into, what's it got to do with your daughter? Nothing. She's just a way for some of my business partners to apply pressure, to keep me from rocking the boat. I just found out that my partners are into a lot more than moving currency. It was drugs, heroin, prostitution... the works. But I swear I didn't know. And when I found out, they threatened to expose me. Delia. - Tell me that that's not what you've been doing. Tell me that that's not where the money came from. You have to understand this, Delia. After I left the military, we had nothing, and I wanted to give you so much. Some contacts in Eastern Europe made me an offer. I didn't think... I kept records of every transaction... names, dates, dollar amounts. It's all here. I wanted to bring you here because... if I go through with this, we might not see each other for a while. This is the only copy. Take it, in case anything happens. I have to put this right. They're not going to let me just walk away. I did my job. I delivered the package. Our business is done. No, no, wait, please! All I'm asking is that you drive her to Paris and put her on a plane. Get Delia back to her mother in the US. You must think I'm a total idiot. What're you talking about? Apparently my father's an international criminal, and I never noticed. It's not your fault. I went to private school in Switzerland. I went on shopping trips to Paris. Not once did I question it. If he testifies, I'm probably never gonna see him again, right? You don't know that. You know, you probably saved my life back there at the hotel. I was just doing my job. Delivering a package? Is that all I am? No, of course not. I'm going to head back into town and get everything ready for your meeting with Interpol. Are you sure you want to go through with this? Don't worry. Everything's going to be OK. Hurry back. [ car starting ] [ car driving off ] 
 
 Frank... Ah! Ah! Ugh! Oof! Ugh! Ah! Ugh! What the hell is going on? Shh. Where's my father? Delia, don't! NO! [ gunfire ] Delia. Delia! Take the back stairs. Start the car. The code is 441257. Now go! sh1t. sh1t. OK, um, 4... No, no, no, no, no. Ugh! Ah! Ah! [ car starting ] Yes. [ tires screeching ] Just keep driving. [ tires screeching ] Where are we going? My house. Then I'll get you to Paris. Who are those people? I don't know. But I'd guess your father's ex-partners. Somebody tipped them off. They're gonna try and kill me as well, aren't they? [ tires screeching ] I can't believe this. He was part of this... whole criminal network. He didn't start out meaning for that to happen. Everything I thought about him was a lie. Delia, he loved you. Really? Or is that just what he said so he could sleep at night? A justification? Look, I'm going to do what he wanted. I'm going to screw these guys to the wall. These aren't small-time mobsters we're talking about. I'm not afraid. Well, you should be. Erase that thing. Walk away. sobbing : I can't. You're safe here, OK? Why don't you get yourself cleaned up? Laundry's over there, bathroom's that way. Yeah. I've got some business to take care of, but I'll be back in a little while. Everything's going to be OK. You have to believe me.

I've got some business to clear up. Not that waitress at the Metropole again! Carla, really. There are rules. [ man clears his throat. ] Excuse me, madam. Who are you? Inspector Tarconi. I was just looking for Frank. Oh, well... Frank's not here. So I can see. I'm sorry I surprised you. But I was not expecting to find anyone here. Frank doesn't usually have many visitors. You know him well? No. What about you? Not so much. I think perhaps this is how he prefers it. I understand. [ man grunting with effort ] [ sighs ] The girl and the driver got away. We've got a name. Someone should be able to lead us right to them. Let's hope so. Delia : Just a minute. I'll be right back, Inspector. [ cell phone ringing ] Hello? Hey, Mom. It's Delia. Honey, are you OK? [ sniffling ] sobbing : They killed him. Mom, they killed Dad. I was there. I saw it. Are you safe? Yeah. Yeah, for the moment. Whe are you? Some... some friend of Dad's. He was there. He got me out. I'm at his house. I need you to come home, Delia. Do you hear me? I can't. No, listen to me. I want you to get to the nearest airport, and the first flight out of there, I want you on it, do you hear me? Delia, do you hear me? OK. I'm really scared, Mommy. I know you are, honey. It's OK. It's going to be fine. Please, just go. Get to the airport and call me when you're booking your flight. I love you, honey. Yes, taxi. Hello. I need a taxi. Dieter, I brought you something. Dieter. No, Frank. Come on. I got you something from Berlin. You have something for me? Absolutely not. You can't take this car. OK, then. If you think you can bribe me with a case of awesome cooled down beer, you are wrong. How could you possibly know that? I'm a German; I can smell beer inside a closed bottle. So, is it a deal? No. You beat these cars half to death. I can't let that happen to the new one. [ Frank sighs. ] I won't take it on a job, I promise. Don't promise what you can't keep. I never do. I trust you, Frank. But the people you know, they make me nervous. Fair enough. [ phone ringing ] Yep? I broke part of this code. There's a name that comes up again and again: Frieder Trumpf. Sounds familiar. He's a major crime operator out of Berlin. There's enough in these files to put Frieder away for a long time. He'll go after Delia. [ cell phone ringtone ] Hello. Hi, Delia. It's me. Fiona. I've been trying to reach your father. sobbing : The house... they broke into the house and... What? When? Who broke in... when? And they were shooting, and they wouldn't stop, and they... they killed my dad. Delia, are you all right? I'm going home. I want to see you before you go. Hotel Suisse, in 20 minutes. OK. Thank you. It's OK, Delia. Ah. Hello, Inspector. I hope you brought cream. You're all out. Where's the girl? Delia? Yes, charming young lady. Where is she? She's gone. She said she didn't feel safe anymore. What? [ cell phone ringtone ] sh1t. Carla, I need a trace on Delia's phone. Madam, welcome. Thank you. Delia. Fiona. Oh, my god. Thank God you're all right. My dad... I know, I know. We need to get you out of here. - OK. OK? Do you have the drive your father gave you? Yeah, it's right here. Here. Good. Let's go. I've got a car waiting. Don't scream or he'll shoot. Give me the bag. Get in. Let's go. Frank, last call is from Hotel Suisse. I'm nearly there. I'm here. I don't see her. Can you tap into the hotel security cameras? That shouldn't be a problem. Frank, she's been kidnapped from right outside the hotel. I got a license plate. Can you run it? Already happening, Frank. Anything? - The van's registered to one of Frieder Trumpf's guys. You said Trumpf was in Berlin. That was yesterday. The guy who rented the van, he runs a small airfield just outside of town. That's where she is, Frank. I'm sending you the location. [ tires screeching ] I checked the files; it's all there. Mm-hmm. How did you know my dad gave me the files? I had the room bugged. I heard the whole thing. She's got nothing else on us. We don't know what she knows, or who she might have spoken to. But I mean to find out. Hey, you've done a commendable job. But I should take it from here. I want to show you something. I just acquired it. This once was used by Wilhelm Furtwangler. He was the last German musical director of the Berlin Symphonic Orchestra. Oh, hold still. Hold still. Hold still. Hold still. Now... are you ready to tell me what I need to know? Why don't you take that thing and shove it up your ass? [ cell phone ringtone ] Yeah? May I speak to Delia, please? Oh, I'm afraid she is preoccupied at the moment. You'll have to call back. This will only take a second. You wouldn't happen to be Frieder, would you? Frieder Trumpf from Berlin? You must be the driver, yeah? I prefer "transporter". You're going to sit down here, OK? Enjoy the flight. Are we ready to take off immediately? - Yes, sir. What the hell? What are you doing? I want this plane in the air. Now! We have a fire in one of the engines. We need to get the hell out of here. You are going nowhere. [ gunshot ] Ah! Ah! [ explosion ] [ explosion ] [ fire roaring ] Officials remain tight-lipped about the incident, but according to a source inside the French police three bodies were found in the wreckage. The first has been identified as Frieder Trumpf, 55, of Berlin, a man with known connections to several criminal organizations. The second body, as yet unidentified, is that of young woman believed to be in her early 20 ... [ sigh ] He's making us look like jokes. The Americans protected him on this deal, but I'll be damned if he'll get away with it again. You'll obey orders. Frank Martin is mine. ...and that wraps it up for tonight. Nice. Good. So... I'm dead, then. It was the only way to be sure they wouldn't keep looking for you. Yeah. Your taxi is waiting, but I told him it was an official police business, so take your time. Thank you. Are you sure you won't stay? Because you are more than welcome. I can't, really. Mm. Perhaps I will go water the Bougainvillea. I guess this is "au revoir"... Are you sure this is how you wanna live your life? Just take care of yourself. I was gonna say the same to you. [ cell phone ringing ] [ cell phone ringing ] [ beep ] [ music ]
