 "Give the Guy a Hand"  (La Main Invisible) 
 [ news excerpts ] 
 33,000 condo units have gone up in Toronto this year alone. 
 What's happening here? There's gonna be some kind of bubble and it's... 
 We've been seeing this for the last 30 years, but when is it actually... 
 I was driving down there the other day and I saw... 
 Labour statistics for the first quarter have shown significant progress over the last year as the construction boom really gets going. It's estimated that over 75% of tower cranes are being leased by Toronto-based construction companies. [ ringing ] Frank. Dieter, how are you? You really want to know? I'm mystified. Seaweed? Ah, yes. You take the cars  and they are dented, or lodged in cement, or this one, with seaweed in the engine. How does it happen? Do you know what salt water does to an engine? I'm sorry, Dieter. I, um... I ran out of road, there was nowhere else to go. Hey, at least in Toronto there's only fresh water. Please, keep the car out of the lake. I have insurance. Yes, but it's still a car. It has feelings, Frank. [ arguing ] You f*cking whore! I'll call you back. Either you move or I'm gonna move you. Move out of the way. No! No, I'm not. Just get out of the... I got it. He's trying to tow my car.  He won't even look under the hood. It might be a simple problem: might not need a tow, right? He's gonna charge me $1,000 if he tows it. And you won't even look under the hood? I said I got it. So why don't you just f*ck off? Maybe the cops can sort this out. Guy wants his f*cking ass kicked. [ cell phone ringing ] Dieter! Frank, I've been thinking... Can you hold on a minute? Oh, Frank, is this a bad time? Would you mind? Oh... Dieter, just stay on the line. I'm gonna f*ck you up. Oh! [ cracking sound ] Ah! Dieter, still there? What's the problem with your car? Uh, it, it just won't turn over. There's this clicking and then it just goes dead. Did you get that, Dieter? There's a clicking and it goes dead. It's a Hyundai Tiburon, '98. Oh yeah, it's a fuse. Go to the fuses, and unplug the top right one. Okay, try it now. [ the engine turns over ] You're a genius. Thank you. You're welcome. She should say thank you to me. Is she pretty, Frank? Gorgeous. Do you have time for a drink? Or can I give you my number? Again, me! I should get her number. Me! Me! Yeah. Funny. Yes, absolutely. ♪ I get up at seven, yeah ♪ 
♪ And I go to work at nine ♪ 
♪ I got no time for living, yeah ♪ 
♪ I'm working all the time ♪ 
♪ Seems to me I could live my life ♪ 
♪ A lot better than I think I am ♪ 
♪ I guess that's why they call me ♪ 
♪ They call me the working man ♪ 
♪ They call me the working man ♪ 
♪ I guess that's what I am ♪ [ music ] [ cell phone ringing ] Did you take care of the car? It's running again, yes. I got to tell you something. I'd like to see other clients. Okay. It's not personal, you know. Do what you need to do for your business, Dieter. [i]My business? It's my peace of mind. You come with trouble. These cars are like my babies. Who gets babies lodged in cement or blown up, you know? I'd like to meet clients with maybe not so much Sturm und Drang. I respect your decision. Thank you. Hey buddy, got a couple of bucks? Help a guy out? You have something for me? Sure. Give me five bucks. It was a couple of bucks a second ago. Time's money, pal. Well? What I got for you is advice. Just because somebody says have a nice day, doesn't mean it's gonna happen. What was that? Yes, Frank? The drop's late. A message just came in this second. Odd timing. The client's asking where you are. Where I'm supposed to be.  Tell them to forget about it. I must have sent you bad coordinates... That's never happened before. Why Toronto of all places? What do we know about Toronto, Frank? Nothing. The whole reason you're there is to open up a new market. This client is very well connected, and things are just too hot in France now. Even Tarconi says you should lay low. Tarconi? When did you speak to Tarconi? We talk sometimes. About what? Mostly how to keep you out of trouble. I can take care of myself, Carla. Okay, so where are we going? Sending coordinates now. Well, send the right ones. Have a nice day, Frank. "Have a nice day." Be on time, or I'll be gone. Sorry, buddy. It kinda got away from me. This won't fit in my car. Uh, no, I would say not. Are you dropping this off? No, I'm picking it up. [ car door opening ] I figured I could get it into the truck, but I was gonna need some help, and then the guys in the store were all, like, go f*ck yourself. kids : Swear jar! Swear jar! Felix, Silver, back in the car. Great. There's another 5 bucks. Hey, you think you could give me a hand? Big guy like you, it shouldn't be too hard. Sure. Just slide 'er in the back. kid : It's a TV. kid : No, it's a dryer. kid : No, it's a TV. Hey, my dad's a jerk. Okay, well... Thanks. Hey, I got something for you. No, no, no, I don't mean like that. Nah, come on. How often do you find a guy who'll help you out like that? No. Look, no, take it. You have no idea how much this means to me. I'm not going to take your money, okay? Okay. Thanks. Okay, okay. Good luck. Take care. Hey. What? When you see a guy flash his headlights 3 times, that's your contact. You're supposed to follow him. [ call signal ] Frank, did you get the information? I don't know, Carla. Maybe, maybe not. I helped a guy with a dryer, but I still don't have a package. There's some problem with getting the package, but it's supposed to be cleared up by now. And now there's something about some other guy and flashing headlights. That's the signal for the drop. It was just delivered to me. Could someone be watching you, Frank? There's no one here, Carla. This guy's a major player in Toronto construction. He needs this package and he's getting very nervous. You're not the one stuck out here in the middle of nowhere waiting to get the job done! You're at home, in Nice, probably on your porch in your bikini! How can you say that, Frank? I'm working just as hard as you! I know you're upset, but the deal hasn't changed. You'll get the pick-up at the first coordinate. No one's flashing me, Carla. Frank? You still there? Frank? This is the last job we're doing for this client. You sure you're not getting this through Kagan? No, I fired him, remember? OK, just checking. We're all following this guy? [ grunting ] Buddy, you okay? I'm going to help you. Get me out of here, man! Get me out of here! Come on, help! Help me! Hey, you okay? Take it easy. Stay calm. I'm not going to hurt you. Take it easy. [ tires screeching ] Take it easy. Oh, f*ck no! You okay? Hey! Drop the knife and kick it away. On your knees! What the hell is this? Get on your knees. Hands on your head. Let's go. Any particular destination? Shut the f*ck up. Will that be a long drive? Don't make me tell you twice. Could we go easy on the cuffs? You want them tighter? Mind if I ask who you are? By the inimitable sense of style and welcoming demeanour, I assume you're cops. You must be looking for a kick in the nuts. I was right. You are cops. So where are we going? Where do detectives usually take suspects, huh? Lunch? Massage parlour? Back to your place? I don't want to ask any questions that are too complicated, but what are we doing here? You're being charged. What the f*ck do you think? Mind if I ask what for? Murder. [ door signal ] I'm Detective Ryder. My partner, Detective Stanwick. So, Mr., uh... Martin Francis. You want to give us your version of the story? There were 3 little pigs... The story with this car, jackass. I wasn't driving that car. Stanwick, you see anyone else driving that car? Recognize him? Guy asked for a hand out, gave him a couple of bucks. Not all you gave him, I'd say. I have no idea what he's doing in the trunk of that car. You were driving that car, numbnuts. Enough with the insults. I. Was. Not. Driving. That. Car. What car were you driving? My name is Martin Francis, I live in France, I'm here enjoying a wonderful holiday, I'm driving a rental, I see a kid driving that car...  looked like he was in trouble.  So I tried to help him out. There are no records of any rental cars in your name. There was only one car at the terminal, and you got out of it, and you're saying you know nothing about this body, you didn't move it, had nothing to do with it? By George, I think he's got it. These're your prints. The prints on the bill are also yours. Yeah, that's the guy. He gave me 50 bucks to move the box. If I had known what was in it, I never would have given him a hand. Get him out of here. Look, I don't know what's going on, but obviously... Shut the f*ck up. You're being held pending arraignment on Monday. Do I get a phone call? 
 
 [ call signal ] Yes, Frank? Call Tarconi. Tell him I'm being held in Toronto on some trumped-up charge. What? What did you do this time? I haven't done anything, Carla, but somebody wants me in jail. Gotcha. [ cell phone ringing ] Allô? Inspector Tarconi? It's Carla. Frank has been arrested in Toronto. He needs your help. I have an associate with Toronto law enforcement. Tell me where he's being held. The Gerrard Street jail. What? We must get him out of there as soon as possible. Witness the seal. Sign across the tape. Have a nice day. [ whistling ] [ grunting ] [ whooping and whistling ] Hold up. You want to tell me what this is all about? I don't know what you mean, man. I'm just, I'm here on a drugs charge. I'm just waiting to see my lawyer. Hey, Peaches. See you in the shower. Those two giving you a hard time? Yeah. Want me to call them back? So talk. They said they were going to reduce my charge. All I was supposed to do was drive the car... What about the body in the trunk? I didn't know anything about that. And now I'm being charged with conspiracy and escape. They're trying to f*ck me! Who told you to do this? The cop? Ryder? So, gorgeous, what are you in for? Modeling without a license? Speeding. Parking tickets. The usual. Oh, I get it, you two are a couple. That's nice. It's gonna be a long weekend for this one. Why don't you two move along? Ask us nicely. [ men shouting ] [ men booing ] What did they tell you? Sorry, man, I got the kids to think about. Party's over. Back to your cells. Now! Frank has been charged with murder. I'm not sure what my people can do. Where was Frank going, and who was the job for? I'll talk to the Canadian client and get all the information I can. They must do it quickly, because once Frank's in the system, there is not much they can do to help him. There will be a long trial. And with all the sh1t Frank's been involved with, he'll go away for a long time. What the hell? Finally an address. 171 Liberty. 8675309. And where's the package? Ja, I could install a cold air intake, a higher torque converter. Maybe swap out the rev limiter chip... How much? Don't you want to know what I'm going to do with it? Just make it fast as hell. And a sound system to blow my balls off. You know what I can do with the sound system... I don't care. Just do it. Look, here's an advance. It's gotta look good, drive fast and sound like I'm at a rock show. Now, what about rims? Rims... make a car look like a whore. Exactly. So, you'll do it? Sure. Yeah. This'll be great. It's gonna be great. Let's go. You call this room service? f*ck you, smartass. You wanna spend another night here? Like you've got some say in where I spend the night. I figured they'd want me in one piece. [ whistling ] Good luck, man. [ door opening ] Thanks for picking up my dry cleaning. Try that again, you prick, you better mean it. I'm going to find out what you're up to, Ryder. Go ahead. There seems to have been some mistake. Oh, really? Detective Stanwick jumped to conclusions a little rapidly. And although we appreciate his efforts, some, uh, incorrect assumptions were made. Cut to the chase, boys. You're going to release me, why not just do it? There are some... formalities. Sit down. You have the sincere apologies of both myself and my colleagues. You don't want me to press charges. That would be the most favourable outcome, yes. Detective Stanwick has two children who are about to begin college. The fact is, the loss of his income would mean that they would lose their chance at a good education and, you know, become a burden on society. Maybe they could work for you, Detective Ryder. That way they'd still have a job and be a burden on society. Ahem. My, uh, suggestion would be that you take the opportunity to walk the f*ck out of here before Detective Stanwick changes his mind and you leave here in a bag. A little privacy, gentlemen? Martin Francis. Sign here. And sign here. Yep. Personal property stays sealed until you've left the facility. Hey, Steve McQueen! No hard feelings, eh? No feelings at all, Detective. No feelings at all. [ call signal ] Oh, that's him. Frank! You've got to get out of Canada. You're not safe. Why, Carla, I'm just starting to enjoy myself. Frank, it's Tarconi. Hello, Inspector. How's the weather at my house? Oh please, this is no time for jokes. Frank, some very dangerous men are fighting over land in Toronto. Another dead man means nothing to them. I just spent the night in jail. I intend to find out why. Get rid of the package you are carrying, and get out of there. You have one chance. Do what he says, okay? I'm afraid that won't be possible. And for a change, I'm going to deliberately break one of the rules. No! Yes, Carla. I'm going to open the package. So, what have we got? Here we are. 520 horsepower at 6300 rpm. That means from 0 to 100 in 3 seconds, maybe 3.1. Then I've installed 16 speakers in Harman Kardon... it's just over 300 kph. Whatever. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, look at those rims. Now that's what makes a car. Okay, the fuel consumption is just actually better... Dude, I don't care. Whatever you did, I'm sure it's fine. It's not really a 'whatever.' Are you kidding? I don't care about the details. Can I pull chicks with it? Is it going to look good down on the Croisette? Will people be jealous? Yes, to all those things. Then I don't care about the rest. Get out. What? I don't want to see you again. You have no respect for the car. For the process. You're just a f*cking asshole. Yeah. OK. But I've got money. So you're a rich asshole. I thought you said it was fast. Hey! Oh, come on now. Just take it off the f*cking lift, man. [ call signal ] Frank... Did you open the package? Yep. What is it? It's a human hand, Carla. A severed human hand. Get out of there, Frank. We'll cancel the contract. Just go! I've been attacked, insulted and thrown in jail just to get me the package. The client  obviously went to a lot of trouble. We owe them a delivery. We've built a business on customer satisfaction. I'm not changing our policy now. You can inform the client I'm on my way to the drop. Okay, Frank. You're looking for a slim blonde woman at the drop. She'll be wearing a silver snakeskin dress. Oh, for crying out loud. Not this bullshit again. Give me the hand. That's got to hurt. Hi, I'm Jenny. Welcome. Membership number? 8675309. Nice to see you, Mr... Nonumes? It's No Names. Of course. No names. First visit? Mm-hmm. The lockers are right down there. I have to ask. The numbers on your fingernails? My phone number. Cute, right? A number for each finger. And even one for the thumbs. [ dance music ] If you have something for me, give it to me now. It's not for you. How do you know it's not? Give me a hand. Well, look who's back. The man pulling the strings. But who's the passenger? Everyone out, gym's closing. The package. You should stick to being a bodybuilder. You can either give it to me, or I can just take it. Boys, I need a hand. Enough! I believe this is for you. Oh, my God. I'm sorry if you had any problems with my security. There was no difficulty. Do you see the tattoo on this hand? My uncle and my father were part of a business group. They own 25% of downtown. Now I run the company. They wanted to develop the city but keep its character, its history. They were dreamers, but this was their vision. It started with Phillips Square. Now it has a life of its own. The city is feeding on itself. A guy named Adam Smith set up my uncle. My uncle took the fall for killing a guy. Then Smith had my uncle killed in jail. Because my father refused to sell him one final building that he wanted to tear down. That's your uncle's hand. Yes. The problem Smith had was getting proof of my uncle's death to my father. That's why they hired you. The prison authorities were trying to keep the hand from getting out of the jail. Personal property stays sealed until you've left the facility. They search everyone as they leave, but they can't search a prisoner's belongings. Especially a sealed envelope. I noticed you opened the package already. Someone went to an awful lot of trouble to get me that package. I had to know. I would have opened it, too. My uncle's death will start a land war. For every building that goes up, 30 bodies will go down. It's the final phase of Smith's land grab. So my night in jail, that was all set up just to get the hand out. Detective Ryder. He promises inmates help with their parole, gets them to help with his little games. This war will begin with the death of my father. Let's see if we can do something about that before things get out of hand. Ah, the lovebirds from cell block 6. Ryder. You're done. I'm not one of your jailbirds, Ryder. Adam Smith. You've got some brass balls coming here. I'm not afraid of you. End of the line, Transporter. We'll finish this delivery. You hired me. And now you're changing the deal. Turn around. Put your hands on your head. You guys get out on good behaviour? I got this. Sign the papers. Look, your brother's dead, your power base is gone. Your lieutenants, they're already fighting for a piece of this. Toronto. Rhymes with money. Carla. It's about time, Frank. Precisely what I don't have. Call Tarconi, have him find a Detective Stanwick. He's the one who set you up? No, it's the other guy, Ryder. GPS me, give Tarconi the information. Tell him that Ryder is dirty and I have proof. You were at my daughter's christening. And now all of this? It's not personal. He just wants that building. He won't kill me, Dad. He killed your uncle. No, no, if you sign this contract, then everything you've ever worked for is gone. If I don't, then everything I have ever lived for is gone. And now you're both dead. [ gasping ] Ah!!! Dad, call the police! Police! The Adam Smith construction project downtown. Thought you might need a hand. You know, all you had to do was say thank you,  and I would have stood by you. But no, I was supposed to take the fall for everything. What the f*ck does that mean? A little appreciation goes a long way. Shut the f*ck up, Stanwick. You should hang on to that building. It's good to keep a little of the past alive. It will never be torn down. I owe you a debt of gratitude. This city will never be able to thank you for what you've done. But I must ask... my brother's hand? Lost in the shuffle. Best forgotten. Frank... will I see you again? The next time I'm in Toronto, I'll swing by. I'd like that. [ dog barking ] [ cell phone ringing ] Hey, Frank. When are you coming back? I got the red car ready for you to drive again. No mishaps this time. How did it go seeing other clients? Oh, it was great. Fine. It was bad. He didn't appreciate me. I appreciate you, Dieter. See? A little appreciation goes a long way. I know, Dieter, I know.
