 [Sound of tires on dirt road.] 
 [Squeeky hinges on rusty gate.] 
 [Speaking Arabic.] Frank Martin. [Speaking Arabic.] He wants mine too. [Sound of approaching motorcycle.] [Discordant music comes up.] [Speaking Arabic.] [Discordant music continues.] [Car door shutting.] Drive. Charming. [Discordant music intensifies.] [Voices of people speaking Arabic.] Stop. Lovely spot for a holiday. "Club Mud." [Man shouting in Arabic.] [Another man contesting in Arabic.] [More shouting in Arabic.] My apologies. Anwar is a bit of a troublemaker. What kind of trouble is he making? Everyone in life wants more than they have. I'm Haroun Talif, the manager. You've met Kedar, our head of security? Sort of. And this is my son, Youssef. [Talif: Speaking Arabic.] I imagine you're anxious to take that off your wrist. This way. How was your trip? Uneventful. Until the sand storm. The winds are quite high. You won't be able to drive back until the evening. Is there a problem? We weren't told the contents of the case. I didn't expect it to be cash. There are many bandits in the area. A gold mine is an obvious target. Mr. Talif, you put us through a lot of trouble to deliver... not a lot of money. You were well-paid, were you not? That's not the point. [Bell rings from a distance.] The shift change. Kedar will take you to your tent. Saved by the bell. [Bell continues ringing.] [Dramatic music comes up.] Maybe he doesn't speak English. Maybe he's a w*nk*r. [Miner Coughing.] What were they arguing about? Our host and that miner, Anwar? From what I could make out, health and safety. The mine's refusing to make improvements. Profits don't go into the local housing, obviously. I'm sure inside the mine's worse. [Discordant music comes up.] What did they make us travel all this way? Something was in that case. Something other than money. Like what? [Loud explosion from outside.] [Shouting voices in Arabic.] [Panicked screaming.] [People screaming in confusion and panic.] [Middle Eastern music comes up dramatically.] [Middle Eastern music continues dramatically.] [Talif: Speaking Arabic.] Three men are dead and six are trapped in the mine. [Man shouting in Arabic.] [Crowd reacts angrily.] What is it? He's saying why don't they send a rescue team from El-Aaiún? [Speaking Arabic.] The sandstorm makes it impossible. The men have only 12 hours of oxygen. [Man: Speaking Arabic.] He used to work in a mine up the mountain. [Man: Continuing to speak Arabic.] He says that there's still dynamite up there. [Talif: Speaking Arabic.] He's saying that even if it's still there, it's been sitting for too long, and even a small bomb could make it explode. [Talif: Speaking Arabic.] Those are the names of the miners stuck down there. [Talif: Pronouncing the names of miners.] [Crowd murmurs mournfully.] [Suspenseful music comes up.] "Youssef." Youssef... His son is down there too. How many off-road trucks do you have? Three. Then you need three drivers to get that dynamite, to be sure at least one makes it back. You are a professional driver, Mr. Martin. And I'm giving you my professional advice. My only son is in there, and you are his only chance. Please. You still need two more drivers. Thank you... Thank you very much. Frank? He's right. I'm the best chance these men have got. That doesn't mean you have to do it. And if I don't? And those men die? [Crowd murmurs their surprise.] That's three. At least let me go with you. I don't need a passenger, Cat. Besides, I need you to find out what else was in that case. You think it had something to do with the collapse? Don't you? We slipped it past customs... Never saw what we had. Why kill their own men? Well that miner, Anwar, who was arguing about safety, he's down there. An accident is a tidy way to solve a labour problem. Do you really think they would collapse their own mine? sh1t happens. And I expect it's a lot more cost-effective than meeting Anwar's demands. Clearly the manager didn't expect his own son to be there. Clearly. But this only happened because I took the job. You're not responsible, Frank. If that's why you're doing this. I don't like being lied to. You speak English? Yes, I do. I'm Caterina Boldieu. He's Frank Martin. My name is Nassima and this is Sulaiman. You know how to drive one of these, Nassima? I used to drive a tractor. Close enough. You have radios? Channel 1 reaches us, if mountains are not in the way. Channel 2 is to talk to each other. Cat has access to the radio at all times. You don't trust us, Mr. Martin? I don't trust you. And I don't like you. As you wish, Mr. Martin. Since Sulaiman knows where the mine is, he'll take the lead. [Nassima: Speaking Arabic.] [Sulaiman: Responding in Arabic .] [Man with radio: Speaking Arabic.] He's established communication with the miners. Youssef! My son is hurt. Then we'd better get going. Kedar speaks the Queen's English. I told you he was a w*nk*r. You seem on edge. Driving explosives on an unpaved road will do that to you. There's something else. I don't like driving slow. You what? I like driving fast, obviously, but slow, I'm... I'm crap at it. You wouldn't do this if you didn't think you'd make it. If I don't come back, kill that guy, willya? [Suspenseful music comes up.] Be careful up there. Yep. [Truck door slamming shut.] [Sound of trucks accelerating their motors.] [Fast-paced music comes up.] [Music fades out.] [Speaking Spanish.] [Suspenseful music comes up.] [Speaking Spanish.] [Suspenseful music continues.] [Sound of door slamming shut.] [Music grows more forceful.] [Sound of gears shifting.] What's this? A map of the mine. If Mr. Martin brings the explosives back in time, we can place a charge here. There's some risk of further collapse, but... it's our best chance of getting them out. Can I have a word? Of course. You brought us here under false pretences, Mr. Talif. False pretences? I found the hidden compartment and the residue. Residue? The plastic explosives. You were ordered to kill those men, and make it look like an accident. You were paid to do a job. Not to make accusations. Three men are dead. Six others could still die. You think I don't want to rescue those men? I think you want to rescue your son. But even if Frank makes it with those explosives... Is that what he wants? What are you asking from me? For your help. To make sure those men survive. And we do, too. [Sound of trucks in distance.] Nassima? Frank, on radio : Ask Sulaiman how much further. Sulaiman? [Nassima: Speaking Arabic on radio.] [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] Nassima  (on radio): Not far now, Inshallah. Right. [Speaking Arabic.] He wants to know why you're doing this. Fancied a mountain drive. What about him? [Nassima speaking Arabic on radio.] [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] When he was young, he was trapped in a mine. A man risked his life to save his. He is repaying his debt to God. And you? One of the miners down there... He's called Anwar. Yeah, I saw him when I arrived. He's my husband. [Dramatic music comes up.] Where's the dynamite? [Rusty door opening.] [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] No. [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] He says it's sat too long. [Suspenseful music comes up.] [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] [More suspenseful music.] [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] The nitroglycerine, it's seeped to the bottom of the crate. [Sulaiman: Speaking Arabic.] [Sound of explosion.] Is that good enough? It better be. C'mon. Thank you. How did you get that? It's a funny story. Funny "ha-ha", or funny odd? Anwar and I, we had a farm. Yeah... where you drove a tractor. Bandits steal our things. They burn our crops. We tried to fight back. Anwar got a rifle to scare them. And then one night, they set the house on fire. It burnt, and I got this. So Anwar works at the mine? 14 hours a day, seven days a week. Rotten food. Poison air. The men who own the mine, they don't steal your things, they steal your life. I saw your husband argue with the manager, Talif. Anwar called a strike to start tomorrow. But now with the accident... That's a fairly nifty coincidence. I thought you were a bad man, until you said you would drive. You said this was a funny story. I like this scar. You know why? It tells me never be a victim. Fight... so my children have a better life. [People talking in Arabic, anxious footsteps.] Youssef? 
 
 [Mysterious music comes up.] Youssef? [Miner 1: Gasping for air.] [Youssef: Calling out name of victim.] [Calling out name of victim.] What's wrong with him? He's not well. Problems with his lungs. You said those men had 12 hours. That's right. And that man's struggling to breathe after four? [Youssef sobbing.] [Sound of door slamming violently.] [Door closing.] [Squealing of straining ropes and tackle.] [More squealing of ropes and tackle.] [Both men heave sigh of relief.] [Nassima breathing a sigh of relief too.] [Caterina on radio.] Frank, you there? I'm here. You okay? Swell. We've just loaded the trucks. How long 'til you get back? It took us two hours to drive up here, but this stuff is so unstable I'd say it'll take six to get back. That's not going to be soon enough. They said those men had 12 hours. That's what they said. How long have they got? I don't know. But one of the men just died. Mohammed. We have to go now. We're not gonna help your husband by blowing ourselves up. We go as fast as we can, and no faster. We're on our way. You follow my path exactly. You understand? [Speaking Arabic.] [Speaking Arabic.] Good. Let's do this. [Truck doors slamming, truck motors accelerating.] [Sounds of truck wheels on bad section of road. Nassima... slow down, there's a bump on the left. You crawl over it, you understand? You crawl. Nassima on radio : Understood. [Dramatic music comes up.] Sulaiman? [Sounds of gears gnashing, wheels grinding.] Is he alright? Nassima on radio : He's fine. [Sound of explosion.] Crankcase blew. This thing's not going anywhere. You can roll it downhill. Where to? There's no shoulder on this road for at least a mile. We need to get past. Come with me. [Sulaiman and Nassima arguing in Arabic.] What? What is it? He says it's God's will and the men can't be rescued. You tell him God helps those who help themselves. Is that from the Bible? The Koran. What are you doing? You're both getting back in your trucks. What for? You're gonna back them up. What good will that do? Just do it! [Sound of rock hitting ground.] She has found something. A way to help the men. A tunnel, adjacent to the collapse. If you breach the wall here, even just a crack, you could get them more air. It's worth a try. She's not even an engineer. Does it matter? Now go do it! As you wish. Do you have any weapons? Why? You'll need them. We both will. Kedar has them all locked up. Can you get the key? I might. Then get it. [Sound of truck motor.] Wait here. What are you going to do? God's will. [Sound of truck coasting forward.] [Dramatic music comes up.] [Sound of Frank hitting ground.] [Sound of massive explosion.] [Thundering sound of truck crashing down hillside.] Can we go now? [Frank on radio.] Cat? How's it going? We hit a little bump in the road. Catarina  (on radio): How little? Frank  (on radio): We're down to two trucks. Nassima and Sulaiman? Fine. We're all fine. Your pal, Kedar, he won't be happy about that. What's he gonna do about it? That's the question, isn't it? Be careful, Frank. Yeah. You too. They are OK? They're down to two trucks. What is it? Where'd you get the key? I stole it from Kedar's tent. I'm to return it before he notices. Too late. Where are the guns? I moved them. For safekeeping. I am the manager of this mine. And I'm the head of security. My key please. What can we do? He still has to make this look like an accident, like there's no way to rescue those people. There won't be if your friend doesn't return with that dynamite. Well then, we just have to make sure he does. I think you are a good man, but a strange man. Thank you... I think. I think you like it, the danger. Most of us want to live a long time. I intend to live long enough. You have no wife? No children? No. Those things give life meaning. I'm glad you think so. I hope you live long enough to find I'm right. Listen, Nassima... You should know I was hired to drive a case from Madrid. They wanted me to think it was cash, but I think it was something they used to trigger the accident, the collapse. To make it look like an accident. Then this happened because of you? That's why you're here, driving this truck? It seemed like a good idea at the time. [Armed man: Screaming in Arabic.] Now I'm not so sure. [2nd armed man: Screaming in Arabic.] They don't look too friendly, do they? [Barking orders in Arabic.] [More shouting in Arabic.] [Shouting in Arabic.] [Screaming commands in Arabic.] [Speaking Arabic.] What do they want? [Screaming in Arabic.] Gold, they say they know we're from the mine. [Speaking Arabic.] Tell them to be careful. [Nassima speaking Arabic.] Or not. [Sulaiman screaming in Arabic.] [Rifle firing.] [Nassima speaking Arabic.] [Nassima speaking Arabic.] I'll show him the gold. Tell him, tell him! [Nassima speaking Arabic.] Say I'll climb inside the truck, tell him it's hidden under the sand. [Nassima speaking Arabic.] [Nassima speaking Arabic, armed man shouting at her.] No, no, stop! [Armed man shouting order.] He says he'll get it. He wants you to tell him where it is. When I say run, you run... OK? OK. Tell him it's by the cab, he has to dig under the sand to find it. [Nassima speaking Arabic.] [Armed man speaking Arabic, Nassima responding.] [Shooting.] Run! [Multiple thundering explosions.] [Sound of debris falling from sky.] [Plaintive violin music comes up.] [Nassima praying softly in Arabic.] [Violin music becomes symphonic crescendo.] [Middle Eastern music comes up.] Cat? Catarina on radio : Here. We're getting close. Have them open the gate. We'll do that. You hear that, Kedar? Right away. We need guns. He took them. He didn't take all of them. [Security guard snoring.] [Sound of cocking rifle's trigger.] [Middle Eastern music comes up again.] [Sounds of preparing rifle to fire.] [Music intensifies and builds.] [Music crescendos.] Not him... Me. On your feet! [Automatic weapon firing.] [Kedar's body collapsing on ground.] [Sound of approaching truck.] [Crowd mumbling excitedly.] [Truck door closing.] Tell him he's going to need a pulley to move it. We are ready. [Speaking Arabic.] Where's laughing boy? Not laughing anymore. You killed him? He did. What about the men? We haven't been able to reach them for an hour. [Music intensifies and builds.] [Suspenseful music comes up.] [Music builds and intensifies.] [Music ebbs and comes back stronger.] [Sound of exploding dynamite and rock.] [Sound of explosion underground.] [Sound of another explosion.] [Music comes up.] [Speaking Arabic.] [Speaking Arabic.] [Speaking Arabic.] [Voices of rescuers and observers.] [Sound of families rejoicing.] [Poignant concert music comes up.] There will be justice for my son. I will make sure there is justice. [Symphonic music builds.] [Anwar coughing.] [Orchestral music comes up more powerfully.] You okay? Let's get the hell out of here. [Motor starting up, car doors shutting.] [Orchestra music builds to grand finale.] [Sound of car speeding away.]
