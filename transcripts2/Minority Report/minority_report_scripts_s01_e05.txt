 (thudding nearby) 
 (thunder crashes) 
 Anybody there? 
 (loud thud) 
 Hello? 
 (beeping) 
 (quietly): Ah, shut that off. 
 (gun clicks) 
 No! No! No! 
 Agatha : Can you see it? 
 What am I looking at? 
 Our future. 
 Plans for a new containment system. 
 A milk bath, Arthur. 
 More advanced than the one that held us during Precrime. 
 This file's ten years old. 
 Because the program was abolished before they could move us into it. 
 "They"? 
 The feds. 
 Defense Intelligence Agency. 
 They had bigger things in mind for us than just stopping local murders in D.C. 
 Like National Security? 
 We were going to be their secret weapon. 
 But the project was halted when they set us free. 
 So that's a good thing. 
 Only if it stays that way. 
 This is what I've been seeing in my vision, Arthur, every day since Dash went back to the city and started working with that cop. 
 You asked me to stop helping them and I did. 
 That isn't enough. 
 What do you think I am? 
 A realist. 
 Unlike your brother. 
 She will betray us, Arthur. 
 You don't know that. 
 I see it. 
 What I see is ancient history. 
 Yes. 
 But when we're too blind to learn its lessons, history repeats. 
 Knew I'd regret giving you your own key, Mom. 
 Yeah, you probably should've thought that one through. 
 Thanks. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Made your favorite. Algae and palm frittata. 
 I can't. 
 Blake's giving a tour to some bigwig fed today. 
 Wants everyone at the precinct early. 
 Oh. 
 Maybe we could plan a little get-together for tonight. 
 You know, something simple. 
 Just friends and family? 
 I-I probably have to work late. 
 I love you. 
 You plan on going the whole day avoiding this. 
 If people will let me. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Happy birthday. 
 Where am I gonna put those? 
 In water. With protein, I'm told. 
 I'm a cop, Dash. 
 Would you give flowers to Blake? 
 Well, I don't know him very well. 
 When is his birthday? 
 (sighs) 
 It's just I'm not, I'm not big on birthdays. 
 What? I love them. 
 Of course, I've only really had ten while technically conscious. 
 They're very nice. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, Vega. Your prom night? 
 You want to eat them? 
 Yeah. 
 I won't make that mistake again. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Vega and her dad share the same birthday. 
 Standing ten feet away. 
 Not in Boston. 
 Well, he should know why you're being a bitch. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 She's right. 
 It's been 17 years and sometimes it feels like it was just yesterday. 
 They never caught the guy who did it. 
 "17 years." 
 Think Precrime would've been up and running in eight months. 
 You would've seen it. 
 What? 
 Well, Precrime didn't start until September of '48 officially, but they had the three of us in secret testing a year before that. 
 For a year? 
 Narcissist incoming. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Detective Vega? 
 Henry Blomfeld, Deputy Director of the D.I.A. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Her Hawk-Eye analyst, Dash. 
 Vega? 
 Walk with us? 
 Oh, it's okay. 
 Aw, you really should. I'm fascinating company. 
 And I'm Akeela. Pleasure. 
 (bracelet buzzing) 
 Uh... uh-oh. 
 Blomfeld :  I was just telling your lieutenant  how impressed I was with Hawk-Eye's numbers this month. 
 He tells me you're partly responsible. 
 Thank you. 
 But Lieutenant Blake is just being modest. 
 It's all him... and Hawk-Eye. 
 I don't think so. 
 You've got a clearance rate four times higher than average. 
 And all on Class One homicides. 
 You should take the victory lap, Detective. 
 You've earned it. 
 Mr. Blomfeld has invited us both to, uh, come by the agency this afternoon. 
 I told him we'd be honored. 
 Vega? 
 Thanks for the invitation, but you're the politician, Will. 
 I'll stick to catching the bad guys. 
 It's nice to meet you, Mr. Director. 
 You as well, Detective. 
 (ticking) 
 (scream) 
 Vega :  Play it back. 
 Frame by frame. 
 (ticking) 
 What's that ticking sound? 
 Is that a clock? 
 It's all I could hear before the scream. 
 Okay, so it looks like the murder happens indoors. 
 I can't tell if it's day or night. 
 Two gunshots. 
 Messy, not calculated. 
 This happens in the moment. 
 No faces, no identifiable markings. 
 Hold it. 
 What is it? 
 It's a 2019 Red Clouds jersey. 
 It's the year that they changed their name. 
 It's almost impossible to get. 
 Believe me, I've tried. 
 Well, if it's rare, maybe we can get Akeela to run the purchase records. 
 (clears his throat) 
 Wally, one more thing. 
 Dash said he was in the milk bath a year before they started Precrime. 
 Beta testing. 
 Working out the kinks. 
 We were instructed to record everything the Precogs saw, matching up their future visions to the deaths that followed. 
 But we weren't legally able to act yet. 
 Worst year of my life. 
 Mine, too. 
 Why? What happened? 
 Oh, Vega... 
 If someone was murdered that year, and they didn't catch the killer, are those visions recorded somewhere? 
 (sighs) 
 Maybe, but-but I doubt it. 
 After Precrime ended, the feds pretty much stripped everything, covering their asses. 
 I can ask one of my old buddies, though, if you want me to poke around. 
 No, it was a long shot. 
 Thanks, Wally. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Blake made me walk that stick-up-his-ass fed through Hawk-Eye's protocols. 
 All 49 of them. 
 I need some action. 
 Then you're in luck. 
 We need you to run a purchase. 
 Hit me. 
 Vintage 2019 Red Clouds jersey. 
 Very funny, Vega. 
 Am I missing something? 
 Yes, the whole concept of a birthday surprise. 
 Which I guess is impossible now that you're working with a... 
 (whispers): a Precog. 
 I knew you'd been eyeing one, so I got it for your birthday. 
 You like? 
 Vega, you're the victim. 
 Akeela : Victim? 
 Is anyone angry at you? 
 Someone who might be holding a grudge? 
 Well, I was dismissive of my partner after he gave me flowers. 
 He might be insulted. 
 This isn't funny, Vega. 
 I'm a homicide cop. 
 The line of people pissed at me starts on the left. 
 Relax, they made 500 of those jerseys. 
 So? 
 So we didn't see my face in the murder vision. 
 Which means, at worst, I have a one in 500 chance of being murdered in the next few days. 
 Well, don't pursue this and it's almost zero. 
 Dash, we're gonna stop this one just like we stopped the others. 
 I'm gonna go see Arthur. 
 In the meantime, burn that jersey. 
 What do you know? 
 Apparently someone doesn't want Vega to see her next birthday. 
 I'm not in the mood for glib today. 
 And I wasn't in the market for a fat lip. 
 Why didn't you call me when you got Vega's name? 
 Because of Agatha? 
 Because she saw a milk bath in her vision? 
 Because she found one. 
 The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended. 
 Maybe still do. 
 They set us free. 
 Minds change. 
 And hearts. 
 Even if that's true, nobody knows where we are. 
 Except Vega. 
 I didn't get another name. 
 Laura Vega... That's all I know. 
 If you're lying to me... 
 You can always punch me in the face again. 
 I can't believe I bought you that jersey. 
 Vega : Forget about it. 
 Look, I was thinking... 
 I got you a death shirt for your birthday. 
 I'm the worst friend ever. 
 Akeela... any details from the murder vision? 
 Did anything pop? 
 I don't know. Maybe. 
 What about these arrows? 
 That's the logo for Revive. 
 It's a program based out of Hayward Correctional Facility, headed up by Dana Winter. 
 They specialize in inmate rehabilitation. 
 Well, I'm guessing the rehab didn't take. 
 Okay, how long will it take you to pull up the files on the prisoners? 
 I was gonna grab some lunch. 
 Well, okay. 
 Let's see if anyone here has had Lara Vega as their arresting officer. 
 Oop! Got a bite. 
 Michael Wynn. 
 Sprawl gang leader. 
 He was into selling Clarity. 
 And women. 
 Didn't much like being arrested by one. 
 You need to piss off. 
 You need to get... 
 Oh, I don't think so, little lady. 
 (grunting) 
 Ah! Ah! You're dead! 
 You hear me, you little... 
 Let's start there. 
 Dash :  You really think Wynn could be the guy? 
 Y-You busted him almost six years ago. 
 Psychos have good memories and this one used to send me death threats every Christmas. 
 But he's in prison. 
 How does he get out to hurt you? 
 People on the inside have a lot of reach. 
 Anyway, that's what we're gonna find out. 
 Yeah, but see... what if that's just it? 
 What if going to see Wynn is what gets you killed? 
 This isn't one of our normal cases, Vega. 
 This is you. 
 Cops deal in life or death every day. 
 Occupational hazard. 
 I know that better than anyone. 
 Listen... 
 I've been probing my brain. 
 Trying to access that part of my memory, to just remember something. 
 Anything. 
 I don't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's not your fault. 
 But this would be. 
 You would be. 
 I should do this alone. 
 Wynn is unarmed, in a room full of guards. 
 Besides, I took him down once. 
 I can do it again. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 If I'm late for work again, you're gonna have to call my boss... for the last hour with my food. 
 I better get a refund. 
 I am not paying for cold moo sh... 
 Woman : 60 years ago, companies outsourced all this stuff abroad. 
 Killed the working class, causing incarceration rates to skyrocket. 
 Now, we give the working class their jobs back, only this time, behind bars, for two cents on the dollar. 
 Doesn't seem right. 
 I'll save my crocodile tears for the victims and their families. 
 We don't forget the victims, Detective. 
 These are our reminders of past victims, past crimes... life-changing mistakes. 
 It also helps them move on to more productive lives. 
 Because all it takes is an arts and crafts project. 
 I know you have history with Michael Wynn and I'll admit, he's not an easy case. 
 But he is trying. 
 We believe he may be about to commit a serious crime. 
 According to data patterns in our Hawk-Eye system. 
 Right. According to data patterns in the Hawk-Eye system. 
 Winter : That's impossible. 
 Michael is closely surveilled, like all our inmates, especially on our excursions. 
 You let them outside? 
 Well, it's good to know I'm busting my ass sending criminals to sleep away camp. 
 We go on weekly outings to restaurants, parks, museums. 
 Tomorrow, in fact. 
 That must be how he gets to you. 
 Shall we? 
 Detective Vega. 
 Heard you might be stopping by for a visit. 
 I'm touched. 
 Don't be. 
 Who's he? New partner? 
 Oh, I'm jealous. 
 We're here on business. 
 Well, I thought you just missed me. 
 I do. 
 Especially your Christmas greetings. 
 Decided to give that up. 
 Changed man, Detective. 
 Really? 
 'Cause something tells me I've been on your mind. 
 Not really. 
 Sometimes, late at night, when I'm... 
 Go ahead. 
 Finish the sentence. See if the feeling's mutual. 
 So you're here to flirt. 
 And reminisce. 
 About the night I took you down. 
 Remember that? 
 Your face in the pavement. 
 My knee in your chest. 
 Good times. 
 You're digging up ancient history. 
 Vega : Do your boys here know about our history? 
 That you got beat up by a former high school cheerleader? 
 Hmm. 
 People here just care about the present, Detective. 
 The here and now. 
 Is that why you want revenge? 
 Put a hit out on me to get back the respect of your friends inside? 
 I keep the past where it belongs. 
 (buzzer sounds) 
 Are you finished here, Detective? 
 Chow time. 
 Stick around. 
 I got all the time in the world. 
 It was nice catching up. 
 Good job. 
 Housebroken. 
 Like a poodle. 
 Vega, watch out! 
 (shouts) 
 Winter : Guards! 
 (grunting) 
 That's two out of three. Want to go best out of seven? 
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 She set me up. She set me up! 
 Vega, this isn't over! You hear me...? 
 You baited him. 
 He attacked me, Ms. Winter. 
 And from the looks of it, he lost his field trip privileges. 
 Who put this here? 
 I don't know. Prisoners are allowed to put things here anonymously. 
 It... could have been anyone over the past ten years. 
 Vega, what is it? 
 Excuse me, please. 
 What's wrong? 
 You got Wynn. 
 They won't let him go on any more excursions... It's over, right? 
 Wynn's not the killer. 
 What? 
 How do you know that? 
 Because I think I know why I get killed. 
 Vega : It's not Wynn. 
 This watch... It was my dad's. He was wearing it when he was murdered 17 years ago, but it was never recovered. 
 The ticking sound from my vision. 
 Exactly. It must all be connected. 
 Yeah, but connected how? 
 Trying to find the guy who killed my dad is gonna get me killed. 
 Maybe he's in this place. 
 Or was. 
 We should get Akeela to run the names of prisoners and alumni. 
 Yes, but there might be something better than names. 
 Like faces. 
 
 
 
 Back so soon? 
 Recordings of Beta Precrime visions. 
 You said that you could poke around. 
 I need access to them. 
 If they did exist, where would they be? 
 I told you, the feds mopped up when Precrime fell. 
 Maybe FBI, maybe D.I.A... 
 Wait-wait, D.I.A.? 
 Defense Intelligence. 
 Blake. 
 He has a meeting there, some deputy director. 
 If they still have recordings of my father's murder, I could catch his killer. 
 Wait, no. You said yourself that looking for your father's killer might be what gets you killed. 
 Yeah, and if it helps me catch the guy, then it's worth the risk. 
 What if it's not just you? 
 At risk? 
 Wally : He's right. 
 The public never heard of Beta Precrime. 
 If you go asking questions, someone's gonna wonder how you know. 
 Do you trust me? 
 Then trust me. 
 Blomfeld :  What happened to letting Lieutenant Blake  handle the politics, Detective? 
 I'm learning to multitask, Mr. Director. 
 Besides, this place fascinates me. 
 So much history. 
 If only you could talk about it. 
 Well, you should come work for us one day. 
 Then you could be part of creating your own history that you can't talk about. 
 Watch it. 
 Please, sit down. 
 Much as I would like this to be a social call, my reason for asking you here is a serious one. 
 I can't give you too many details, but there's intelligence that suggests a terrorist attack is imminent. 
 Foreign? Domestic? 
 What we know for certain is the group is decentralized. 
 We think it could be the same people who bombed the N.I.H. Took down the Monument. 
 But no group was ever pinned for that attack. 
 Not officially. 
 But two words keep popping up: "memento mori." 
 Latin. Yeah. 
 For "remember you will die." 
 Oh, they sound friendly. 
 You think Hawk-Eye can help? 
 Well, it seems to be the best we have these days. 
 Computers are the most accurate predictors of future threats that we have left. 
 Since Precrime. 
 You said it. 
 But of course, we wasted that. 
 On what? Stopping murders? 
 No, by missing the bigger picture. 
 For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened. 
 When it turned out the system wasn't foolproof, we gave up. 
 The next year, 4,000 people died in the bombing on the Mall. 
 And they would've seen it. 
 If we'd been smart enough to keep them. 
 Instead, we set them free. 
 And no one knows where they are now? 
 (door opens) 
 Agent : Sir... 
 (whispering) 
 I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short. 
 Something's come up. 
 Of course. 
 You said six years? 
 That's how long the Precrime program ran. 
 Officially. 
 I heard rumors there was beta testing at least a year before the public knew. 
 They were seeing murders that no one ever tried to stop. 
 Uh, Vega, the man is busy. 
 Walk out with me. 
 The existence of Beta Precrime was top secret, Detective. 
 If the public found out that the federal government had been predicting murders that they never stopped... 
 There'd be a scandal. 
 Understandably. 
 Which no one wants. 
 And what is it you want? 
 Justice. 
 While the D.I.A. was testing Precrime's accuracy, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders the Precogs saw. 
 If those visions are still archived somewhere, Metro can change that. 
 Cold cases. 
 My father was murdered that year. 
 Vega... 
 Oh, it's okay, Lieutenant. 
 We all got into this business for a reason. 
 I wish I could help, Detective. 
 But the Precrime vision archives were destroyed when the Supreme Court ruled the program unconstitutional. 
 These days, the murder visions only exist in one place. 
 Where? 
 Inside the Precogs' heads. 
 But good luck finding one. 
 Dash : The vision is still in my head? 
 Vega : And according to Blomfeld, all other records have been destroyed. 
 I'm sorry, but it's been too long. 
 If I still had that memory, I would remember it. Right, Wally? 
 Not necessarily. 
 What? 
 Wally : Over time, connections break down in the inferior temporal cortex and we lose the ability to access our memories. 
 We forget. 
 Correct. 
 However, some trace of the memory still exists as a pattern of neural connections deep in the hippocampus. 
 Exposed to the right stimulus, those neurons light up. 
 The right stimulus? 
 Through BIMR. 
 Brain Imaging Memory Recall. 
 "Beemer" for short. 
 It takes a specialized piece of equipment to scan those memories. 
 And could we find one of those machines around? 
 Yes. 
 Where? 
 Under the stairs. 
 I offered to take it off the program's hands early in the trial process, so they never had a chance to destroy it. 
 Wally, if you knew you could access my old visions, why didn't you tell us? 
 You didn't tell me Vega's father was the victim. 
 Besides, there's some, uh... discomfort involved. 
 Well, it can't be worse than what Dash has been through already. 
 There are ways. 
 Forget it then. 
 No. 
 Let's just do it. 
 But that's not the hard part. 
 Your visions from the days of Precrime were formed as part of a symbiotic neural link with your twin brother. 
 Each brain was just one half of the whole. 
 That means we can't even access those memories without... 
 Arthur. Yes. 
 Wally : And visual stimulation... 
 Pictures, home video from you, Vega, of your father. 
 I can get those easy. 
 But I can't get Arthur. 
 He won't help us. 
 Sure, he will. 
 As long as the price is right. 
 No, not this time. 
 Why? 
 What's different? 
 ♪ You've got those loud bitches ♪ 
♪ Loud bitches telling you lies ♪ 
♪ Don't listen to those girls ♪ 
♪ They're just snakes in disguise ♪ 
♪ You've got the truth coming to you ♪

 Careful. 
 He cheats. 
 (men chuckle) 
 I'm certain the guy on your left is wanted by Interpol. 
 Please don't arrest him. 
 Why? He has all the chips. 
 Not for long. 
 What's this about? 
 Agatha's wrong, Arthur. 
 My brother would make a lousy spy. 
 He knows me. 
 He knows I couldn't betray him like that. 
 Then that settles it. 
 I'll stake my life and freedom based on my brother's gut. 
 I'm gonna need you to. 
 Because I can't find the person who killed my father without your help. 
 Your father? 
 It happened before Precrime started, when you three were still in training. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 You guys never knew your father. 
 (chuckles) 
 Terrific role model. 
 Dumped my mom before we were born. 
 Well, mine was a good cop and even better father. 
 He was home every night even though he worked double shifts. 
 The day he died, I hurt him. 
 I know I did. 
 Families fight. 
 I've heard. 
 And what makes you so warm and fuzzy anyway? 
 Are you really asking me that? 
 Ten years in a milk bath, I know. 
 But it's not like your brother had it any easier. 
 I've seen things he hasn't. 
 I would never do anything to hurt Dash. 
 Or any of you. 
 I think you know that. 
 What does your gut say? 
 That you have a good chance of ending up dead very soon. 
 Cash me out. 
 Only because it's your damn birthday. 
 Arthur, you remember Wally. 
 Arthur. 
 So good to see you. 
 You're the guy who used to do my nails. 
 Knock it off. 
 Let's just do this. 
 It's, uh, an optogenic-based brain-imaging memory recall device. 
 It looks for ion channel... 
 Try it again. 
 Like I'm six. 
 Strap you both into that thing and mine your brain for the vision. 
 Mine, like dig? 
 Sure, why not? 
 Coming? 
 Thank you. 
 Anytime. 
 Never again. 
 Wally : You two always worked more smoothly with a little lubricant... Dopamine, opioids. 
 Vodka's the best I got. 
 What, no tonic? 
 Wally : You'll also need these... if you've grown attached to your teeth. 
 Here comes the pinch. 
 What we're looking for are patterns... 
 Specific neural circuits in their brains that code for memories of your dad. 
 That's why we show them pictures, home movies, recordings of his voice. 
 Man : I, Hamilton Vega take thee, Lily Vega to be my lawfully wedded wife. 
 All : Three, two, one, blow! 
 (clapping, cheering) 
 Come on, put the camera down. 
 Come on, let's cut the cake. 
 They're not responding yet. 
 How much longer can they take this? 
 I don't know. 
 Their memories are-are so degraded, they're not remembering your dad. 
 (Hamilton whistles) 
 He used to whistle this to me. 
 Hang on, I'm getting something. 
 Wally : It's the whistling. 
 It's-it's sparking something, an old vision. 
 Are you sure you want to see this? 
 Yes. 
 (gun fires) 
 (gun fires) 
 Oh, my God. 
 From everything I found, Dina Winter is a saint. 
 ALU Person of the Year, Luxor genius grant. 
 You sure she's your guy? 
 She killed my father in cold blood. 
 I saw her do it, we both did. 
 Akeela : Well, they didn't have a history that I can see. 
 She was into drugs, though. 
 Her earlier years. 
 I count three possession charges the same year your father died. 
 What about this guy? 
 Any facial matches? 
 What do we know about him? 
 Just that he'd make a terrible eyewitness. 
 Can you swipe that off, please? 
 Sorry. 
 She just doesn't seem like the same person. 
 People will surprise you. 
 So how do we bring her down? 
 I confront her. 
 Record the whole thing with my lenses, get her to confess. 
 And if that doesn't work? 
 You saw a vision of her shooting me too, right? 
 If I can't nail her for my father's murder, I'll get her for attempting mine. 
 No. No way. 
 It's too dangerous. I won't let you. 
 It's the only way. 
 She saw me take my father's watch. 
 She could run, she could get away. 
 You could die. 
 I think you should do it. 
 She needs to do it. 
 Vega : I love that you care, and I'm thankful for what you and your brother did for me, but this is something I've been living with for a long time. 
 I need to do this, Dash. 
 Then I need to come with you. 
 (door opens) 
 Lily : Lara? 
 Hi. Hey. 
 Rico : Where are you going? 
 I was just headed out. 
 Rico, go. 
 Uh, Mom, I really have somewhere to go. 
 I'm not just leaving to leave. 
 I still miss him, too, baby. 
 You ever think about the person who did it? 
 For years... 
 I used to fanaticize about everything I would do to them. 
 How much I would give to spread the hurt. 
 To make them feel it, too. 
 But you got over it? 
 Let's just say that I'm happy I never found them. 
 I got to go. 
 They're chocolate. 
 Dulce de leche frosting... Your favorite. 
 Save me one. 
 (crickets trilling) 
 (sighs) 
 You don't have to do this. 
 If you think that, you don't understand. 
 I was embarrassed when my father wore his uniform and dropped me off at school that day. 
 I told him to drop me around the block. 
 And I'd just walk. 
 That's not a good enough reason to get yourself killed. 
 Don't worry. 
 I ditched the jersey. 
 We can change the future, right? 
 Sometimes it's the past that's harder to escape. 
 Vega? 
 Don't lose yourself in there. 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 Detective Vega. 
 Kind of late to be making house calls. 
 I'm pretty sure you recognize this. 
 Um, I'm not sure what you mean. 
 Isn't that the watch you took from my clinic this morning? 
 No, it's the watch you took off my father's body after you killed him. 
 You're recording this, I assume? 
 With one of those nifty A.R. devices? 
 I work with criminals, remember? 
 You are a criminal. You're a murderer. 
 The-the person who... murdered your father was a junkie. 
 Someone who couldn't see past her next fix. 
 Stop pretending like you're talking about someone else. 
 And one stupid night, when she was so hopped up on heroin she couldn't see straight, she... did something terrible. 
 Something she could never take back... 
 You're talking about yourself! 
 Calm down, Vega. 
 Be careful. 
 That junkie... 
 It was you, admit it! 
 (screams) 
 Vega! 
 It was you. 
 That night weighs on her... still. 
 And... no amount of good she's done has ever made it right. 
 But... she kept trying. 
 Keeps trying. 
 You got to turn your life around. 
 Because you got to have one. 
 You got to live. 
 He didn't. 
 (gasps) 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Say it was you. 
 Please... 
 I-I have a family. 
 A son... I've changed. 
 I'm not that junkie in the alley anymore. 
 You expect me to buy that?! 
 You would shoot me right now if you had the chance. 
 Where's your gun? 
 I have one for protection, but, uh... 
 Not another step! 
 Where's your gun?! 
 The only person with a gun here is you! 
 You can't know how sorry I am. 
 It was the worst mistake I'll ever make. 
 Saying yes. 
 "Saying... yes"? 
 To the job. 
 You were hired? 
 Vega, look in the mirror! 
 Uh, are you okay, Mom? 
 Bradford, put down my gun! 
 Bradford... that's your name? 
 I'm Detective Vega. 
 Don't move! 
 Dash : Vega, look at his shirt. 
 Maybe you weren't the victim in my vision. 
 He was! 
 Bradford. 
 How about this? 
 How about I put my gun down first? 
 Okay? 
 Okay... 
 Stay back! 
 Bradford, a long time ago, your mom... did something she can't take back. 
 I won't make the same mistake. 
 You shouldn't, either. 
 This isn't the way. 
 Listen to her, honey. 
 Okay. 
 You're okay. 
 You're okay. 
 Are you okay?! 
 Yeah. 
 Please, he-he didn't mean to... 
 (whispers): Go upstairs, baby. 
 Before... you said someone hired you to kill my dad. 
 Who? 
 Lycon. 
 He was my dealer. 
 Some guys came to him. 
 Said to make it look like a mugging. 
 Which guys? Who were they? 
 I don't know. 
 I never met them face to face. 
 But I will tell you everything I know. 
 Just... keep my son out of this. 
 Please? 
 Let this end with us. 
 An eyeless man? 
 Lycon, a longtime dope peddler in the Sprawl back when Deena was a junkie. 
 He might be the go-between for whoever hired her to kill my father. 
 Dash : No one's heard from him in years, but we figured with your connections... 
 If this is all you have to go on, it's pretty thin. 
 I'll look into it on my end. 
 Thank you, Arthur. 
 For this and for before. 
 I don't expect a thank you from you. 
 But an apology for slugging me in the mouth would be nice. 
 Why? You deserved it. 
 Okay, then. 
 But next time? I hit you back. 
 You know your way out. 
 I just need a little more time. 
 You know I'll help you with this Lycon thing. 
 Whatever you need. 
 Thanks. 
 But right now, I need to go home. 
 Vega? 
 When you get home, grab the chair.
