 Previously on "Nashville"... 
 Hello? 
 Scarlett? 
 Wanted to tell you how impressed Rayna was with your performance. 
 She'd like to sign you as a solo artist to her label. 
 You just got yourself a record deal. 
 I wanted to ask you out on another date... dinner, a movie. Anything you want. 
 I'm going back out on the road soon, and you might consider coming with. Both of you. 
 This is the first guitar I ever tried to play. 
 My mom gave it to me, and now it's yours. 
 You're dead in this business! 
 I don't know, man. 
 I feel more alive than I have in months. 
 ♪ 
 (Rayna) I'm so excited that we're here in New York. 
 Second leg of the tour with my girls. 
 Yes! So cool. 
 I just love that we're having a little bit of girl time before spring break's over. 
 Yeah. We're gonna go shopping... 
 (Tandy) Yes. 
 We'll go sightseeing. 
 Hang out backstage at the Barclays Center? 
 Yes. 
 Talk to Juliette Barnes. 
 Okay. 
 And you know, we should go to the MET. 
 That'd be great. Wouldn't it be fun? 
 Not really, no. 
 Oh, my gosh. Look, it's you. 
 (Tandy) Wow. 
 Oh, my gosh. Mom, you're huge! 
 Thanks, honey. Thank you. 
 You're huge. (Giggles) 
 Gorgeous shot. 
 Oh, that's from that commercial campaign I did. 
 They're sponsoring the tour. (Horns honking) 
 You are on a 50-foot billboard in Times Square. (Daphne giggles) 
 That's a big deal. 
 (Rayna) You know what's a big deal? 
 Let's put it in perspective. 
 The big deal is I got my girls here in Times Square. 
 Yes, that's a big deal. 
 That's a big deal. 
 (Laughs) Perfect deal. 
 So... what do you think of New York? 
 I think it's nice. 
 It's a lot cleaner than I thought it would be. 
 Maybe Emily can show you around a little bit, huh? 
 Or maybe you and I can take in a Broadway show? 
 There's no way. No chance. I'm way too busy. 
 She's got her new single launch tomorrow and a bunch of call-in interviews. 
 Marshall and his lame roll-out plan. I swear... 
 Juliette. 
 I know. 
 Serenity to accept the things that I cannot change. 
 Got three sold-out shows in the city. 
 Your mom's getting healthy. 
 You got a lot to be thankful for. 
 Yes. I'm zen. I am positive, I'm focused. 
 What the hell is that? 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Growls) 
 What's that? 
 A grapefruit. 
 I have grapefruit? 
 Yeah. You do now. 
 In the last month, I've seen you eat fruit twice. 
 I don't want you getting scurvy when you're on the road. 
 On the road. Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you really that concerned, or are you just gonna miss me a whole lot, huh? 
 Well, we've hardly spent any time apart since our first date. 
 Maybe I'm just not ready to say good-bye. 
 So don't. 
 No. Come with me, you know? Keep me well fed. 
 Oh. You want me to go on the road with you? 
 (Chuckles) 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I mean, if you can get away from the clinic and all. 
 (Sue growling) 
 When were you thinking? 
 To get on the plane? 
 Yeah. 
 Um, today, you know? Before it takes off. - It's a little last-minute. 
 Yeah, you could see it like that, or you could just think of it as, uh, I don't know, very romantic, you know? Spontaneous. 
 Well, I already know that about you. 
 Yeah? 
 Am I gonna be in your way? 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Besides, you know what? 
 I think you could help me out here with, uh, Sue... uh, who I think is gonna have a lot of separation anxiety. (Growls) 
 So, uh, I'll be all right myself, but, uh... 
 Yeah. 
 I don't think you have any idea how much that dog'd miss you. 
 (Chuckles) 
 I got you a present. 
 What did you do? 
 Oh, no. (Laughs) 
 What? 
 I know how much you love cleaning... 
 (Laughs) so I thought, you know, give your hands a treat. 
 They're awful. Thank you. (Laughs) 
 Well, I'm glad you love 'em. Mmm. 
 Aw. (Laughs) 
 Whoops. 
 Oh. 
 Um, I just... I heard some people down here, and I thought I'd come introduce myself. 
 Hi. I'm Will. I just moved in upstairs. 
 Gunnar. Nice to meet you. This is my girlfriend Scarlett. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 You a cowboy, musician, or both? 
 Uh, here, musician. 
 Back in Abilene, I might have worked a ranch or two. 
 I'm guessing from the songs I hear filter up through the floor y'all musicians, too? 
 Yeah, you got that right. 
 Cool. Cool. Maybe you give the new guy some pointers? 
 Where to play around town? 
 Why don't you just come around for supper tonight? 
 Can have a little welcome to Nashville thing, you reckon? 
 Yeah. Yeah, sure. 
 7:00 all right? 
 See you then. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Oh, almost forgot... um, I got some of y'all's mail by mistake. 
 Ah, thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Footsteps recede) 
 Looks like you got something important from Edgehill Records. 
 Hey, Hailey. 
 Was hoping to catch you. 
 Hi. 
 Sorry for not getting back to you. 
 Work's busy. 
 Yeah. No problem. 
 Just wanted to get you some of my new material. 
 I still owe songs against my publishing deal, right? 
 I got one on here would be perfect for Eric church. 
 Avery, your value to us as a songwriter was in you being a performer attached to a label. 
 I know. I know, but there's more to me than just being a performer. 
 Burning your masters? 
 When Jeannie found out about what you did, I almost got fired. 
 And I'm truly sorry that I put you in that position, but I... I did what I had to do. 
 You're in breach of contract with South Circle Publishing. 
 Look, you're crazy talented, and I believed in you. 
 But you gotta find a new record deal or pay back the advance. 
 I can't do that. I mean, I got nothing. 
 Well, she's not gonna write you off as a loss, so you gotta do something. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 I am powerful. 
 I am confident. 
 I am centered. 
 Good, Jolene. 
 Juliette. 
 I'm zen. 
 I am positive. 
 I'm really pissed off! 
 You gotta stop doing that. 
 I... how can I when I know Rayna's big face is staring at me? 
 It should be my face up there. 
 My single's coming out, not hers. 
 This is therapy. Can we please focus inward? 
 An ad campaign plastering my face all over the world... that could make the difference between my album skyrocketing or crashing. 
 Honey, you sell millions of records. 
 You're not gonna crash. 
 If I wanna stay in this position, then I need to keep selling albums. 
 If I just had a big name sponsor behind me, it would help turn this record platinum. 
 Come on. You're a businessman. 
 Or you were before you blew it all on cocaine, but you understand what I'm talking about. 
 You're supposed to accept the things you can't change. 
 This one... you absolutely can. 
 Now that is the kind of attitude I need around here. 
 You get an offer a month ago and you didn't tell me about it? 
 You didn't even say you auditioned? 
 I did not audition. (Thud) 
 I only sang to cover for the fact that you weren't there. 
 (Sighs) 
 The reason I have not said anything to you is because I've been trying to convince them that we are better together than I am as a solo act. 
 Everybody in this town is trying to get a contract, myself included. 
 And you're... you're looking for reasons not to sign one? 
 I'm looking for ways to include you, which is the way it should be. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 'Cause not talking to me for a month about it... that's really inclusive, Scarlett. (Huffs) 
 (Woman) We love your music. 
 All right. It's great to meet y'all. Thank you. 
 Okay. Let's go get some dinner. 
 Can't we just eat catering backstage? 
 No, we're gonna go eat some good Chinese food in New York City. 
 Oh, she just wants to be back before Juliette Barnes' sound check. 
 And mom's. It's good experience for when I start touring. 
 Say what? 
 I wanna sing. 
 Professionally. 
 (Sighs) 
 Since when? 
 Since, like... now. 
 She wants to be a celebrity. 
 Well, I didn't say that. 
 (Horn honks in distance) 
 Let's go. Come on, Sue. 
 Deacon! 
 Hey. Look who's here. 
 I didn't know Deacon had a dog. 
 (Deacon) Oh, that's sue. 
 Uh, me, neither. 
 Is that the niece you were telling me about? 
 Nope. 
 Hi! Hey, how y'all doing? 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 This is Sue. 
 Hi. I'm Rayna. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. This is Stacey. 
 Stacey. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 This is Tandy. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Y'all working together? 
 No, no. She's, um, uh... 
 I'm his girlfriend. 
 Girlfriend. She's my girlfriend. 
 (Tandy) Wow. 
 (Rayna) That's nice. 
 (Deacon) Yep. 
 Um... 
 Well, we are gonna go get some Chinese food. 
 Y'all take care. See you. 
 It's adorable, that doggy. 
 Bye. 
 You, too. Nice to meet you. 
 (Under breath) Girlfriend? 
 Yep. 
 (Knock on door) 
 Hello? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 (Door closes) 
 Let me get that for you. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Now remember, nobody can know you were here, okay? 
 Oh, come on, Teddy. 
 You know I'm a master at keeping secrets. 
 (Sighs) 
 Nice house. 
 So you're saying I can't pursue a career in music? 
 I... I just don't want you to do it now, honey. 
 Right now you should be doing a lot of different things, figuring out what makes you happy. 
 But I already know that singing makes me happy. 
 Great. So keep on singing. 
 But not professionally. 
 Honey, as soon as you go professional, people are gonna start trying to turn you into something. 
 I don't want you turning into anything. 
 Now is a time for you to study and enjoy your childhood. 
 But I'm not a child. 
 She's a tween. 
 I'm 13, stupid. 
 Hey, hey, hey. (Exhales) 
 If you don't want me to become, like, a famous musician, then why'd you give me this guitar? 
 That is a very special guitar. You take good care of it. 
 I gave you that guitar so you could write songs on it and work out your feelings. 
 Well, you didn't get me anything and I have feelings, too. 
 Seriously? Now come on, y'all... 
 We both wanna be performers, mom. 
 You can even sign us to your new label. 
 Nobody is getting signed to anything. 
 Okay. Big show tonight. 
 Why don't we let mom have a little bit of space? 
 Can we go to craft services? 
 Yes. Great idea. Go to craft services. 
 (Door opens) 
 You do realize that they just wanna be like you? 
 They can be like anything they want. 
 I just want 'em to grow up first. 
 That is the V.I.P. room for afterwards. 
 Here's the massage room. 
 Wow. 
 Yes, we have a massage room. 
 Mm. 
 Gets very stressful. 
 Yeah, I'm sure it does. (Laughs) 
 That's the, uh, crew right there. 
 Okay. 
 That's Dave. He's stage manager. Mitch is on drums. 
 Uh, Paul right there is front of house. 
 What's... 
 Yeah, uh, sound. 
 Oh. 
 (Chuckles) Hey. 
 Hey, how are you? 
 (Lowered voice) I have no idea who that guy is. 
 (Laughs) Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Who's the new guy? 
 Uh, that's my mama's sober companion. 
 And you must be Stacey. 
 I am. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. 
 Yeah, you, too, and all good things, of course. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, then he must not have told you everything. 
 Enjoy the show. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Wow. She is a real firecracker. 
 I'd love to get back in here on a weekend night. 
 We're booked solid on Saturdays through the next few months, at least. 
 Any night then. 
 Or any last-minute cancellations. 
 I just wanna play, you know? 
 Truth be told, I could use the money. 
 It's gonna be tough. 
 Why? 
 I mean, I packed this place out. 
 My music's always killed here. 
 It ain't about the music. It's about Marilyn. 
 She put the word out,  and... if we wanna be in business with her...  
 You can't be in business with me. 
 It'll blow over. 
 Just give it some time. 
 Yeah, well... 
 I'm running out of that. 
 So how long you two been together? 
 Personally or professionally? 
 A few months. 
 Cut any demos yet? 
 Um, actually, we... we got a publishing deal on our first one. It was really lucky. 
 She was real lucky. 
 Don't sell yourself short, Scarlett. 
 She's just got a recording contract with Rayna Jaymes. 
 Whoa. 
 That's pretty damn quick. 
 I-I hope some of your luck rubs off on me. 
 Well, thank you. It's, uh, it's not settled yet. 
 I have to finish making dinner. 
 Uh, maybe you can tell him about the best clubs to play around here.

 So, uh, I would love for you to set up some meetings with corporate sponsors while I'm here in New York. 
 Why? 
 You've turned down every company I've sent your way before. 
 Because I'm not a 15-year-old girl peddling cheap perfume anymore. 
 I'm an adult, and I think it would be good for any company to have me on board who's trying to reach a 20-something audience, wouldn't you think? 
 I can arrange a meeting with Keoh Electronics tomorrow.

 Thanks.

 (Man) Can I get you something? 
 No, I'm okay. 
 How's it going? 
 It's going. 
 You okay? 
 I... 
 I'm just a little surprised, you know, that you would invite me out here when you've clearly had history with both of the headliners. 
 I mean, are you trying to scare me away? 
 No. Hell, no. 
 Just... we've been having a lot of fun. 
 I just didn't want it to end at all. 
 Is that what we're doing? 
 Not what I meant. 
 You know what? I... (Sighs) 
 Didn't expect to come here and fit in and feel comfortable, or... but I did expect for you to be honest with me about the most important relationships in your life, and not have to hear it from some weird, kabuki kind of conversation with a woman you've sung love songs with for the last decade. 
 Okay, Stacey... 
 It's a little... 
 Stacey. 
 Uh-huh? 
 You're right. 
 You're right. I'm sorry, all right? 
 I should have explained it all and told you that, yeah, I have a history with Rayna, and it's long and it's complicated. 
 But... 
 It is history. 
 Is it? 
 'Cause you know, it doesn't really seem like that. 
 I don't know what to tell you. It is. 
 (Tandy) What's bothering you? 
 Maddie is really struggling. 
 You know, this divorce, man. 
 You know, and she's the same age I was when mom died. 
 Yeah. 
 I know exactly how she feels. 
 All I wanna do is just protect her. 
 And it doesn't feel like having her here, hanging out with Juliette Barnes is doing that. 
 This isn't about Juliette. 
 They idolize you. 
 They are not idolizing me right now, I'll tell you that much. 
 Of course they are. 
 No. 
 We all do. 
 And so for the girls, if they want to fantasize a little bit about what it would be like to be a big star, if it helps them through this hard time, what's the harm? 
 The harm is that I... have two really, really talented daughters. 
 And I don't wanna see 'em messed up by this business. 
 But they don't understand that. 
 At their age, all they can hear you saying is "no." 
 And from their point of view, well, it sounds the way that it sounded to you when you felt like daddy didn't support your dreams. 
 What? 
 Don't compare me to daddy. 
 I'm just sayin'... 
 You should start thinking about that Keoh Electronics meeting. 
 I have, and I want you to come with me. 
 No. No, that's... that's not what I'm here for. 
 Come on. You come alive when you strategize and talk business. 
 Why deny yourself something that gives you that rush? 
 I'm supposed to deny myself the things that give me that rush. I'm an addict. 
 Okay, we're not talking about cocaine. 
 We're talking about a corporate meeting here. 
 Please? I'll be better if you're there. 
 Please? For me? Please? 
 For you. 
 Hey. Good night. I know I haven't seen much of you today, but the show was really amazing. 
 Good night, mama. 
 So we have to be there at 4:00. 
 Okay. 
 Um, what... about our therapy? 
 Oh... 
 Uh, you can go to my crew A.A. meeting. 
 It's good. 
 Okay. Uh... 
 Yeah. You... you should definitely go to that. 
 All right. I can do that. 
 'Night. 
 So I'm thinking when I walk into the meeting, I should sit down... 
 No. 
 You should probably stand. 
 I should stand. 
 Yeah. 
 And I'm gonna tell them my stats, but I'm not gonna be forward about it, I'm gonna tell 'em... 
 Look, just... just be honest. 
 I have faith in you. 
 (Woman) Thanks for coming, Deputy Mayor. 
 Thank you. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Coleman. (Chuckles) 
 We celebrated you passing the bar at this very table. 
 We did, and that's ancient history. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Look, that stadium... it's a done deal tomorrow. 
 Is that what Teddy said? 
 I know nothing's closed yet. 
 I'm sure he... tells you whatever he thinks you need to hear. 
 Why don't you just, um... sell the land? 
 Donate a couple million to charity? 
 You think I spent all that time and money on Teddy so he could put me in this position? 
 No, no, no. 
 He's gonna make good on his deal to build where I say... or he's gonna wish he had. 
 Look, Lamar, why don't you just let this thing go? 
 Now, uh... if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone. 
 You'll see things differently after Teddy disappoints you the way he's disappointed me. 
 And when you do, you come see me, like in the old days when you had real power. 
 Any possibilities there? 
 Nah. 
 We'll have to find something else. 
 Maybe something... pPersonal. 
 I just got some information from a tabloid source. 
 Not sure how useful it'll be. 
 We have confirmation on who leaked Teddy's divorce to the tabloids. 
 So you a Texans or Cowboys fan? 
 (Scoffs) Neither. Longhorns. 
 Ah. (Laughs) 
 (Laughs) 
 Hey, what's up with the Titans? You follow them? 
 Well, man, they're worth watching. 
 People go crazy on game day. 
 But they draft from Texas Tech, Baylor, Aggies. 
 Dudes you'd recognize. 
 How are the cheerleaders? 
 (Laughs) Hope you don't think me rude, but I'm gonna call it a night. 
 Oh. Well... (Sighs) thank you very much for a lovely dinner, and I hope we do it again soon. 
 You're very welcome. 
 (Train whistle blows in distance) 
 You read my mind. (Bottle cap fizzes) 
 Thank you. (Door closes) 
 (Inhales and exhales deeply) 
 Hope you don't mind my asking, but, um... you and Scarlett live together, you write together, perform together. 
 How come she's getting a contract from Rayna Jaymes, and you're not? 
 (Scoffs) 
 Sorry. It's none of my business. 
 Just seemed like it was causin' some problems for you, is all. 
 (Chuckles) Uh... my brother died two days before the audition. 
 She wanted to reschedule. I wouldn't let her. 
 Then I got drunk and never showed up. 
 She was right, and I was wrong. 
 Tomorrow's another day. 
 (Clink) 
 Good afternoon, everybody. 
 How are you? 
 Thank you all so much for taking the time to meet with me. 
 I know you're very busy, so I appreciate it. 
 The new album... it's going places. 
 But that's not why we're here. 
 And let me guess... it's not about whether or not you like my music, or whether you think my fan base is gonna buy your product, because that's a given. 
 I've got 15 million Twitter followers, 30 million Facebook fans, and more Tumblr pages than any country music star on the planet. 
 But you're worried that I'm a bit of a loose cannon. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm not gonna deny that I've had my share of issues. 
 But I think all of us can admit that we've had some heartbreak in our lives. 
 Mine just happens to be in the public eye. 
 But I'm taking responsibility for my mistakes, and I'm moving forward. 
 My best days are not behind me. 
 They're in front of me. 
 ♪ 
 Thank you. 
 I take requests, folks! 
 A dollar? 50 cents? 
 Hell, I'll even take a quarter if I like the song enough. 
 Well, how 'bout, uh, "Kiss," or "Twist of Barbed Wire"? 
 (Sighs) You see, I heard you were out here busking,  and I just had to come see it with my own eyes. 
 Yeah. Some kind of poetic justice, right? 
 Hey, it's all right. 
 You wanna come down here and gloat? I get it. 
 No, I'm not in a position to, brother. 
 I'm going up to Ohio to work for my dad. 
 What are you talking about, J.T.? 
 You're a killer bass player. You can't do that. 
 Yeah, well, it's like you said, not everybody can make it here, right? 
 Maybe you should go home, too. 
 Get a job working with dear old dad. 
 I don't know. That's the same guy who said I was throwing my life away and I was a waste. 
 I'm not going back home. 
 Never. 
 Then you're just a bullheaded as he is. 
 Scarlett's moved on. 
 You can't get gigs here, man. 
 There is nothing for you in Nashville anymore. 
 Music's all I know how to do. 
 Hey, I don't want your money. 
 I'm not giving it. 
 It's for a roadie gig. 
 Call this guy. He's a good man, all right? 
 You won't be making any music, but it sure as hell beats playing in the street. 
 Wow. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 You're welcome. 
 (Juliette) I did it. (Door closes) 
 You're looking at the new Keoh Electronic poster girl. 
 4,500 billboards nationwide, and they're gonna cross-promote the new album. 
 (Sighs) Heaven sakes, I am sorry that I stole Dante. I am. 
 But, mama, I just won a multi-million dollar endorsement deal. 
 Can you at least pretend to be happy for me? 
 You think that money's all that matters, don't you? 
 Uh, no. I think that your hotel room costs $1,500 a night. 
 And you haven't complained about massages and room service... 
 You know, I am not here for that. 
 You're here because you have nowhere else to go. 
 You know what? You're right. 
 You're all I got. 
 There's nowhere else I would rather be. 
 (Voice breaking) And if you would just figure out how to feel more for me than you do for some cell phone deal, then maybe we... 
 (Inhales and exhales deeply) 
 Please tell my sponsor that I have gone to the A.A. tour meeting in case he wants to talk to me about it at all. 
 (knock on door) 
 (Door opens) 
 (Scarlett) Hey. 
 Gunnar? 
 Hello? 
 You awake? 
 (Groans) 
 What time is it? 
 I gotta go to work in a minute, but I... been waiting all day for you to wake up. 
 (Sighs) 
 I'm not signing this. 
 What? 
 Before I met you, I just wrote poems. 
 And everything since that night has been 'cause of you. 
 And you've worked so long and so hard to get one of those. 
 I wouldn't be here without you. 
 And I won't do it without you. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Door opens) 
 Okay. Is talent ready for sound check? 
 Oh, yes. Thanks, Buck. 
 So here's the thing... your talent is a gift. Both of you. 
 And me wanting you to take the time to develop that isn't me trying to hold you back. 
 Even though I know it might feel that way. 
 It's just that I love you so much, and I want you to have every advantage that time and experience can give you. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Yeah, I get it. 
 Well, it's time for sound check. 
 And, girls... this is your stage. 
 You're gonna get up there right now and do sound check. 
 Do that song you've been working on. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Laughs) 
 (Laughs) 
 Uh, Daphne and Maddie, everybody. 
 (Applause) 
 (Woman) Yeah! 
 (Man) Go get 'em, girls!

 Whoo! 
 (Cheers, applause, and whistles) 
 Hey, babe. I'm in here. 
 In my daughter's house, no less. 
 Question is why. 
 Teddy's not home yet. 
 Well, that's fine. 
 I don't have much left to say to him. 
 If I did, he wouldn't listen to me. 
 He would, however, listen to you. 
 About what? 
 I want you to change his mind about the stadium site. 
 'Cause I remember you being quite creative with accounting on that cumberland deal. 
 So seems to me you could come up with something to make him see things my way. 
 I don't think so. 
 But you do think you're the only person in town with friends at the tabloids. 
 (Magazine thuds) 
 Excuse me? 
 How do you think Teddy'd feel if he knew it was you who leaked all those lies about Rayna and his divorce to the press? 
 I can't imagine he'd take too kindly to it. 
 I don't know what you're suggestin'. 
 I'm suggesting that you cooperate. 
 (Cheers and applause) Whoo! 
 Thank you, Brooklyn! 
 (Juliette, amplified voice) You guys are awesome. 
 Thank you, everybody. 
 My next song is my brand-new single. 
 (Cheering) 
 I'm really excited to perform in here tonight and... and for it to be on my new album, which you guys are all gonna go online and pre-order tonight, right? 
 (Cheering) 
 Okay. No, but the, uh, the best part about singin' this song tonight for y'all is, uh, I get to share it with somebody who means a lot to me, and who has been an amazing influence in my life recently. 
 Um, and that's my mama. 
 (Cheers and applause) 
 There she is. (Laughs) 
 (Cheers and applause continue) 
 Thank you for being here tonight, mama. 
 This is for you.

 Hey. 
 You need to sign this. 
 No. 
 You were wrong. 
 I wasn't mad because you got an opportunity that I wanted. 
 I was mad because you didn't have enough respect for what was between us to tell me about it. 
 Look, I get it. 
 (Clatters) 
 Avery's a jealous son of a bitch. 
 He couldn't handle your success. 
 But I need you to know that I am not that guy. 
 I'm the guy who's proud of you and excited for you. 
 You sure about that? 
 Sure that if I watch you waitin' tables at the Bluebird instead of doin' what you're meant to be doin', I'll never forgive myself. 
 I'm sure that I love you. 
 Sign the damn contract, please. 
 (Both breathing heavily) 
 I love you, too. 
 (Laughs) 
 (Laughs) 
 Hey, how are you? 
 Hey. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Those girls of yours... 
 I know. 
 (Chuckles) Good luck with that. 
 What am I gonna do? 
 They'll be fine. They got you. 
 Hey. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 I really like Stacey. 
 I'm happy for you. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, I've been thinking. 
 Yeah? About what? 
 Lamar. 
 I told you, don't worry about him. 
 No, I'm not. It's just... maybe we should spend a little more time considering his stadium site. 
 There is a lot more room for expansion there. 
 No. 
 Last thing I need is to be tethered to that man. 
 Well, he is the most influential power broker in town. 
 I wanna see you in the governor's mansion. 
 And like him or not, Lamar can help you make that happen. 
 (Car door opens, door alert chimes) 
 (Car door closes) 
 So where to? (Trunk lid squeaks) 
 Downtown. Got a bus to catch. 
 Where you headed? 
 New York. Joining up with a tour. 
 Oh, you're a musician? 
 (Closes lid) 
 Roadie. 
 (Door alert chimes) 
 (Gears shift) 
 Why is that so important to you? 
 Because it means success. 
 And you know what success means? 
 Love? 
 Thank you for helping me with my meeting and with my mom. 
 Seems like there's nothing you can't do. 
 (Exhales) 
 Well, I wouldn't say that. 
 (Sighs) No, I can't. 
 You can unless you don't want to. 
 I think it's a little more complicated than that. 
 You know what I like about you? 
 You see me for who I really am. 
 Who I wanna be. 
 Juliette, look... 
 Look, you told me sometimes we spend so much time trying to keep out the bad that we end up missing out on the good. 
 (Man speaking indistinctly on TV) 
 Easily recognized by his mane. 
 The male lion's primary role is serve as protector while the lioness hunts for prey. (Remote control clicks) (Horns honk in distance) What time is it? Oh, it's late. How was the show? It was good. I'm sure Rayna and Juliette brought the house down. Yes, they did. And how were you? I was amazing. (Laughs) Oh. I've been thinkin'... Oh, yeah? About what? I've been on the road a long time, you know? I just... Been everywhere. Met a lot of interesting people. Think I had a good run. "Had"? Yeah. There's a lot of things a musician like me  can do in Nashville, you know? Off the road. No, Deacon. You don't have to do this for me. I know. Maybe I'm just tired of the whole circus. Maybe I just wanna go home. Besides, the road is no place for a new dog. Or an old one. (Whispers) You're not old. (Whispers indistinctly) No. You're perfect. You gave those girls... (Ice crunches) The thrill of a lifetime. Thank you. They were so great, weren't they? Oh! (Clinks) Cheers. And I heard what you said. Hmm? Although that part that you threw in about daddy... low blow. I had to get your attention somehow. I don't think that was necessary. And as I recall, you used to think he hung the moon. No, I didn't. Yeah. No, I never have. You were such a daddy's girl. That's not true. Oh, yes, it is. (Lamar) I don't care what it costs, Albert. (Albert) Good to know. (Clank) What about the Peggy Kenter situation? Yeah, I spoke to her. What'd she have to say? She's not gonna be a problem. So she's on board. (Sighs) Here's to our new baseball stadium. (Flames crackling) (Glass shatters) (Gasping) Lamar? (Continues gasping) Lamar? Lamar? (Clatters)
