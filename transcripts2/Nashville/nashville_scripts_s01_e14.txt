 Previously on "Nashville"... 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Came to pick up my big brother. 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 That's a violation of parole. 
 Thank you for letting me stay here. 
 It is not for you. It's for Gunnar. 
 I want a divorce. 
 He's still with that woman. I heard them on the phone. 
 You are my employees. You work for me, not this man! 
 I quit. 
 I don't think I can do this. 
 You can. I know you can. 
 I know that you're getting out of rehab. 
 Wondered maybe if you wanted to come live with me? 
 Honey, do you think you should be spendin' so much money? 
 Maybe I should ask my manager. 
 She says it's fine. 
 Do we have anything else to do today? 
 Uh, Deacon's birthday's on Monday if you wanna get him a present. 
 Do you know which one it is? 
 Uh, does it matter? They're all supposed to be special. 
 Well, maybe we could throw him a party, and I could help. 
 I'm pretty sure you're the last person on the planet who should be planning a party. 
 Although it's not a bad idea. 
 Didn't expect a visit from the first lady today. 
 It's always a pleasure to see you, Mrs. Conrad. 
 You, too. 
 Are you staying at Peggy Kenter's house since you moved out? Excuse me? 
 Well, I know you're sleeping with her. 
 I don't think my personal life is your concern anymore. 
 It... it is my concern, actually, when our 13-year-old daughter overhears you on the phone saying something like, "it feels right to be with you." 
 I tried to explain it to Maddie the best I could, but let me be clear with you about something... 
 I'm not covering for you with our girls the way I did with the press. 
 Okay, fine. I'll talk to Maddie, all right? 
 Yeah, you're damn right you will. 
 Look. They're my daughters, too, Rayna. 
 Well, keep your girlfriend away from 'em. 
 Fine. 
 Do you want a hand with that? 
 No, I'm fine. 
 Here, give me one of those. 
 Thanks. 
 You doing the crossword? 
 Nah, I'm no good at those. 
 I'm trying to find a job for a dude with no I.D. 
 I can't help thinking it'd be easier for you if you went back an fixed things in Texas first. 
 Law ain't the only folks lookin' for me back there. 
 I might have made some enemies during my time. 
 Milk and cleaning supplies in the same bag? 
 It's ridiculous. Hey, check this out. 
 That's just wrong. 
 What are you, the grocery bag police? 
 We, uh, spent some summers baggin' groceries at Mr. brown's corner store. 
 We'd have been fired if we put refrigerated goods and scouring powder in the same bag. 
 At Mr. brown's, we pack your sack. 
 We pack your sack to save your back. 
 At Mr. brown's, we have a knack. We know... 
 Just how to pack your snacks. 
 Hit me. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What's wrong? 
 I just wanted to let you know that Teddy and I are getting a divorce. 
 What? 
 He filed three days ago... 
 In Sumner county, you know, so that we'd have a little more time before people figure it out, get our ducks in a row. 
 He's been sleeping with Peggy Kenter, too, so... 
 Do you wanna come in? No, I don't. 
 I really wish I did, but I don't. 
 I gotta go pick up the girls anyway, and got a lot to do, so... 
 I'm coming with you. Just give me a second. 
 So far, over two dozen R.S.V.Ps. 
 Not bad for a few hours. 
 Wow. Well, the man's got fans. 
 Did Watty White R.S.V.P.? 
 Because if he comes, everyone's gonna come. 
 A definite yes. He said he'd pay good money to see Deacon's reaction to a party thrown in his honor. 
 He hates them. But I'm telling you, it's all because nobody's ever thrown him a good one. 
 Have we figured out how to get him there? 
 Uh, I thought you'd handle that. 
 Doesn't he have a niece that lives here? 
 Maybe we can track her down and see if she can help. 
 Hey. How are you? I am so glad to see you. 
 How are you, jolene? I'm good. 
 Baby, this is Dante, my addiction counselor. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 So you two ready to get started? Yeah. 
 Us two? 
 We talked about this. It's a family session. 
 Uh, I can't. 
 I can't do it today. I'm sorry. 
 I'm in the middle of... of planning this party. 
 Next time, okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. 
 Next time then. That's good. 
 No problem. Well, let's... let's go. 
 I feel like I wouldn't be doing my sisterly duty if I didn't ask about the Deacon of it all. 
 Um, oh, boy, things with us are so strange right now, and I have not talked to him, and I need to. I really do. 
 But you know... 
 Priority is the girls, you know? 
 This is so hard on them. 
 And so I just... I just need to focus on them right now. 
 Hey, mom, you've got to see this. 
 They wrote about your divorce. 
 Thought you were workin' on lyrics. 
 I am. 
 Kind of just looks like you're just mad at the floor. 
 I get writer's block, and I clean. 
 It's a thing. Well, I won't help, 'cause I don't want to get in the way of your process, so... 
 Nice try. Would you mind seeing if Jason has any laundry to do? 
 All right, that I can do. 
 Did you know he had a gun? 
 No. What are you doing? 
 I'm gonna take... unload that. 
 Scarlett, he is my brother, and I will deal with it. 
 And you are not leaving this house with a loaded weapon! 
 Fine. But nobody's getting hurt with this gun. 
 You promise me that. 
 I promise. 
 Xxx they know about the divorce? 
 Is any of this true about Deacon and Liam? 
 Not a word. No, this isn't... uh, too... 
 You know what, girls? Let's go on out to the car. 
 Aunt Tandy's gonna take care of all this. I got it. 
 I got it, just go. Just buy all those magazines. 
 Throw them in the garbage. Here, take your purse. 
 *** 
 So you're saying all those pictures were just photoshopped? 
 No, honey, I'm not saying that. 
 Honey, it's all about making money for those people. 
 The people who take the pictures, the people who publish them with all kinds of misinformation... they prey on celebrities. 
 But they were right about the divorce, and they were right about dad. 
 They're not right about this. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 What? 
 Wow. Deacon texts now. 
 I gotta talk to him. 
 Well, you could use that thing in your hand to call him. 
 I don't think this is a phone call kind of a conversation. 
 You need to be careful. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 You wanting to meet all the way out here... am I just supposed to act like this is normal? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm supposed to act like this is normal? 
 You going through my stuff now? 
 You said you got rid of it. 
 You said you wanted to start over clean. 
 You lied. 
 I'd love to forget about my past, but it ain't gonna forget about me. 
 Stop being a jackass and give me the gun. 
 Come on, man. I need that. 
 No! 
 Why the hell did you do that? 
 I did it for your own good. 
 You got no idea. 
 You and I are done. 
 No, we are not done. 
 You owe me eight years for the time I served. 
 You owe me a life. 
 You owe me a life supposed to be mine. 
 Don't you come callin' for me to bail you out again, 'cause I am not gonna be there. 
 Gunnar. 
 Gunnar! 
 Gunnar! 
 Hey there. Hi. 
 Hi. Are you Scarlett O'Connor, Deacon Claybourne's niece? 
 Yes. Is everything all right? 
 Oh, don't be afraid. 
 Hey. I'm Juliette. 
 Scarlett O'Connor. 
 Nice to meet you. Look, I'm kind of in a rush, but I was hoping you could help get Deacon to the bluebird Monday night for a surprise party. 
 Deacon's a little funny about parties. 
 He doesn't like them. 
 He sits at home and watches "old yeller" every year. 
 Well, I don't care what he's done before. 
 He's gonna celebrate his damn birthday. He hates them. 
 He's not gonna hate this one. Trust me. 
 He's gotta be there at 8:00 P.M. 
 Okay. Can you do that or not? 
 If I tell him that my friend Gunnar and I are singing, he might turn up. 
 Okay. Well pick your favorite song, and we'll see you there. 
 You want us to sing? 
 Sure, you can say you opened up for Juliette Barnes. 
 Just get him there on time. 
 Okay. 
 So what's next for you? 
 I'm contemplating some things. 
 Yeah, well, you should be mayor right now. 
 We're not here to talk about me. 
 What are you doing for your birthday? 
 I'm contemplating a few things. 
 No, you're gonna sit at home, you're gonna watch "rin tin tin" again. 
 It's "old yeller," man. Come on, now. 
 It's a great damn movie. It's a classic. 
 Whatever, so... am I gonna be the one that brings up the elephant in the room? 
 Probably, yeah. 
 You didn't know about Rayna and Teddy splitting up? 
 I found out the same way the whole world did. 
 Rayna, we're going to manage this, but in order to do that, I need absolute honesty from you. 
 So did you sleep with Liam McGuinnis or Deacon Claybourne while you were married? 
 And please tell me there's no s*x tape. 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 Do I need to leave? 
 No, I might, actually. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 You know, I'm not gonna... answer questions. 
 Okay, but at the very least... 
 Just be sure not to be photographed with any men who aren't your father. 
 I can call Juliette's people and tell them Rayna won't be coming to Deacon's birthday party. 
 Deacon's having a birthday party? 
 Are they doing a public screening of "old yeller"? 
 Whatever it is, madam, you aren't going. 
 Did she just call me "madam"?

 Nice song. 
 You plannin' on being here every day? 
 On an as-needed basis. 
 Okay, well, if my mama still needs you, you should probably check in another part of the house. 
 Here's what I don't understand. 
 Why ask your mom to stay with you if you don't want to be part of the recovery process? 
 I am a part of the recovery... a big part. 
 I'm the check-writing part. 
 That's not what I'm talking about. 
 I can tell you from personal experience the time when I finally got clean was when my family got involved. 
 Frankly, you're more interested in this party you're throwing. 
 Get a load of this. 
 Xxx no way. 
 Well, looks like the queen of country music won't be coming to my party. 
 Oh, you mean Deacon's? 
 You know what I mean. 
 Hey, this is Peggy. Please leave me a message. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 So my people are telling me I need to distance myself from you, which I don't want, and I hope you don't either. 
 But, uh... I'm gonna think of something. 
 I promise. 
 And one, two, three, four, and five... 
 I feel like everybody's looking at me. 
 That's because everybody is looking at you. 
 Rayna. Hey. 
 Hey, Jane, how are you? 
 I'm just fine. Good. 
 Tandy. Hey. 
 I saw that you and Teddy were on the outs in that terrible magazine. 
 I just wanna say I am so sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 And don't let all that stuff about you and your guitar player get to you. 
 There was always talk, so what's just a little bit more, right? 
 Okay. 
 She has not changed one bit since high school. 
 She has so much nerve. 
 Everybody knows that she's cattin' around with her Manny. 
 I thought it was that tennis... the tennis instructor? 
 Hey. Y'all looked... mmm... incredible. 
 Incredible. Let's get your coats. Let's get out of here. 
 No sugar for mama? 
 Teenagers. 
 Hey, Rayna! Rayna Jaymes! Over here! 
 Car how are you and Deacon? Huh? 
 What's going on? 
 Been trying to get some on the side? 
 Excuse me. 
 How's it going with you and Liam? 
 Are you guys still seeing each other? 
 Who's better? 
 Talk to us, Rayna! 
 Hey, guys, beautiful family! 
 Mom, I'm scared. 
 Girls, don't look. 
 Yeah, I think I'm gonna go ahead and get this. 
 Man, I used to dig your shows over at the 5 spot. 
 Yeah, me, too. New stuff's pretty different. 
 Now, anyway. Like, uh, hip-hop/indie/punk. 
 What do you call it? 
 Ah, I don't really know anymore. 
 Well, whatever it is, man, it seems like it's making you some cash, man. 
 Let me go grab that case for you. All right. 
 Well, that's a thing of beauty. 
 She goes 25k, I bet? 
 Thereabouts. 
 Uh, Mr. white, you probably don't remember me, but we've actually met before. 
 I'm Avery Barkley. I used to date Scarlett. 
 Oh, right, sure. Right. 
 Is it all right if I get your advice on something? 
 See, I'm working with this producer out of Atlanta. 
 And, um, what he's done with my sound, I'm just... I'm not sure it's what I should be doing. 
 Well, "should's" not the right word when it comes to music, son. Just my advice. 
 Thanks. 
 That sounds pretty. Is that new? 
 Uh-huh. How you feeling? 
 How 'bout we get out of here? I don't think we can. 
 Everywhere we go, they're just gonna hound us. 
 I'm gonna stay here. 
 I'm holing up, and I'm gonna write until this whole thing passes over. 
 That's a good plan. 
 How 'bout I go pick up the girls for you? 
 Bye. Thank you. 
 We're gonna get you a new phone number. 
 Looks like we've got us a dog. 
 Mama, you don't mean we're gonna keep that old, ugly yeller dog, after what he done? 
 He isn't an ugly yeller dog. 
 Comin'. He's a purdy yeller dog. 
 Comin'. 
 Happy Birthday. 
 Thank you. Mama called. Told me to give you this. 
 You have to do this. Wait. Wait. Look. 
 Eh... what are you doing to my cupcake? 
 I'm fixin' it. 
 Now you get frosting in every bite. 
 That's pretty smart. 
 I thought of that. 
 You doing the usual? 
 Oh, yeah. Come on in. Watch with me. 
 No, that movie makes me cry. 
 And I gotta go get ready for the bluebird tonight. 
 I'm playing with Gunnar. Oh, cool. 
 You ain't seen us play yet, have you? 
 No, I haven't. 
 Hey, why don't I come watch y'all play tonight? 
 That's such a good idea. 
 I'll see you at 8:00. 
 All right. See ya then. 
 Happy Birthday. Thank you, cupcake. 
 Here we are again. 
 And people wonder why you can't get anything done in government. 
 First of all, the photographs of my wife were taken completely out of context and used unfairly to attack her character. 
 Xxx she has certainly never been unfaithful, and neither have I. 
 And my wife and I are going through a very civil divorce, and I ask that you respect our privacy at this time. 
 Xxx to the real business of the city, I have two new appointments to announce... 
 Cayden Maxwell, as head of my business advisory council, xxx and Peggy Kenter will be joining my administration as a financial consultant for special projects. 
 Now I hope that this puts an end to any specu... unbelievable. 
 Paw-paw! 
 Daphne, I need to talk to your mama, all right? 
 Okay. 
 You come to tell me that this reflects poorly on the mayor's office? 
 I came to tell you that I'm sorry. 
 See, when I put Teddy up for mayor, I thought it might help him to right his ship, keep the family strong. 
 After everything that happened with that cumberland deal, he needed a win. You did, too. 
 So you gonna... you gonna fight back? 
 Have your attorney threaten a lawsuit. 
 No, daddy. I'm gonna... keep my head low and wait for these damn reporters to come up with something else they wanna talk about so I can walk out my front door again without publically embarrassing my children every day. 
 Rayna... 
 You didn't do anything wrong. 
 Don't you dare walk down the street anything less than proud to be who you are. 
 You may use your mother's maiden name, but you're still a Wyatt. 
 You only have to explain yourself to people you care about. 
 All the rest of 'em... 
 Well, they can go to hell. 
 We're about to sing in front of so many big country music stars. 
 You nervous? 
 Nah. 
 What is it, then? 
 Jason called. 
 After two days? 
 What'd he say? 
 Don't know. I didn't pick up. 
 Hard to find parkin'. 
 
 
 
 What are y'all doin' out here? 
 Makin' sure you turn up. 
 Ha. 
 Lookin' forward to it. 
 I keep hearin' about this hot new duo. 
 You know, first time I ever even did an open mic, it was here. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 After you, old-timer. 
 Age before beauty? 
 Thank you. 
 Surprise! 
 Oh, no. No, no, no, man. Hey, come on. 
 Give it a minute. Give it a minute. I can't believe you did this! 
 Your pretty little friend over there did it. 
 Oh, that I believe. Happy Birthday! 
 You shouldn't have. 
 I know, I know, but I'm taking your advice and treatin' people better. 
 And look at everybody who wanted to say Happy Birthday to you! 
 Aw. There you are. What's up, man? 
 How you doing, bro? Hey, thank you, man. 
 Hey, kip, thanks for coming. 
 I wasn't gonna miss this thing. 
 This guy's been inspiring me for a long time. 
 I find that hard to believe. 
 Your songs are much happier than mine are. 
 I don't know, bud. You look pretty happy right there, bud. 
 Jolene, how you doing? Good to see you. 
 I wouldn't miss this for the world. 
 Baby, you saved my life. 
 I'm glad you're looking so good. 
 Hey, Pam. Happy Birthday. 
 Thank you, sweetheart. You know Juliette Barnes? 
 Miss Tillis, it is such an honor to meet you. 
 I'm a huge fan. Thank you for coming. Thank you. 
 She's nicer than I heard she was. 
 Thank you guys so much for coming. 
 It's so great to see how many people love Deacon as much as I do. 
 And a little fun fact is Deacon's got so much talent, it couldn't all be contained in one generation. 
 So, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Deacon's niece Scarlett O'Connor and Gunnar Scott. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Deacon, I'm sorry for tricking you into coming out here, and for the photographs. 
 But Happy Birthday.

 Hey, Ray. 
 Hey, Watty. 
 Hey, did you leave already for Deacon's party? 
 Not yet. 
 Could you do me a huge favor? 
 Would you be willing to come by and... 
 I just wanna play you something. 
 Sure. See you in a bit. 
 You're a sweetheart. All right, I'll see you. 
 So many fine men. 
 Have served the city of Nashville from where you now sit. 
 I'm well aware that several did in large part due to your efforts, myself included. 
 Well, it's always nice to be appreciated. 
 Hmm. So how can I help you? 
 Could have treated my daughter better. 
 Huh. 
 With all due respect, I did that... for 13 years. 
 Apparently, it wasn't good enough. 
 Now... if you have Metro business to discuss with me, I'd be open to hearing it, but if you came down here to dig into my marriage, my divorce, or my personal life, that is not gonna happen. Hmm. 
 Oh, Teddy. You're right, you're right. 
 After all... you're not my son-in-law anymore, you are the mayor. 
 And to that end, I have some... appointment suggestions. 
 Hank Tully as the deputy mayor is the most pressing. 
 Okay. I'll definitely consider him. 
 You make sure you do more than that. 
 I took an oath to serve the best interests of the people of this city. 
 Hopefully, they align with yours. 
 Took an oath, did ya? 
 Isn't that kind of like a vow? 
 Hey, Rayna! Rayna Jaymes! Rayna Jaymes! Over here! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Wanna leave? 
 Hey there, Rayna, here to see your boyfriend? 
 Hell, no. 
 Good girl. Give me a minute to get around here. 
 Rayna! Hey, Rayna! 
 Hey there, Rayna, here to see your boyfriend? 
 Hey, Rayna, how long you been seeing Liam, huh? 
 Lucas, what happened? 
 "The tennessean" stop paying you? 
 I thought you were a real photojournalist. 
 If y'all excuse me, I'm gonna get on with my life. Thank you. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Still out there. 
 Well... 
 Now this is a surprise party. 
 Happy Birthday. 
 Thank you. 
 Deacon. Hey, what's the name of that crazy song... 
 I'm sure you don't wanna talk about it, but can I say at least you look great in the photo? 
 Cheers. Cheers. 
 It's good to see you. You, too. 
 Gunnar Scott? 
 Yeah? 
 We're gonna need you to come with us. 
 Man, I gotta say, I never thought I'd see the day that Deacon would actually celebrate his birthday. 
 You and he both. 
 You know, he still watches that movie on vhs. 
 Mr. gill, Mr. white, it's such an honor for y'all to be here. 
 I hope you're having fun. 
 Well, more fun than he is, probably. 
 And you came. I did. 
 Even with the article about you and Deacon. 
 Girl, you have got to get a new publicist. 
 Well, it's a beautiful party. 
 Thank you for having me, and I've got a song that I would actually love to play. 
 You know, I didn't know you were comin'. 
 Got a little something I wanna sing myself. 
 We'll see. I'll let you know. 
 Charming. 
 Charming, yes. 
 All right. How 'bout a few words from the birthday boy? 
 Deacon, get your butt up here. 
 Aw, man. 
 All right. Okay. Um... 
 Do I have to? 
 Come on. You have to admit, this is more fun than sittin' at home watchin' a sad movie by yourself. 
 For the record, "old yeller" is not a sad movie. 
 It is the uplifting tale of the unconditional love between a boy and his dog. 
 It's easy to forget how many friends you have, and you guys sure do know how to make a man feel, uh... 
 Appreciated. 
 And let's not do this again next year. 
 To Deacon. 
 To Deacon! 
 To Deacon! 
 To Deacon! 
 Whoo! 
 What? Somebody drop the cake? 
 Not exactly. 
 What the hell happened? 
 She was fine. You saw her. She was all right. 
 I'm fine. That's how it is with this, you know? 
 Just when you think you got it licked, that's when you're most vulnerable. 
 Will you call her addiction counselor, see if he can come get her? 
 Let's just get her home, Juliette. 
 No. No, you stay. I got this. 
 Come on. I really wanted to sing for you. 
 Yeah, well, I hear you sing all the time. 
 I wanted to sing here. 
 "Financial consultant" was perfect. 
 We'll meet once a week and, uh, go over the budget with my whole staff. 
 It's smart. 
 It's all business. Nothing to hide. 
 Are you saying that we have something to hide? 
 Huh. 
 So nice to have all these friends here tonight. 
 Um, well, as everybody in this room knows, Deacon and I go back a long time. 
 If there was no Deacon Claybourne, there would be no Rayna Jaymes. 
 Mr. Watty white is gonna help me out. 
 Pam Tillis and Kate York, will y'all come up? 
 They're gonna help me out, too. 
 Deacon, this is for you.

 Yeah, since I'm here, you wanna talk? 
 How you doing? 
 Fine. 
 Why was it so important for you to throw this party? 
 You wanna tell me about your 9th birthday? 
 Well, she obviously already told you about it. 
 I didn't get your side of it. 
 I had never had one before. 
 She rented out the party room at Dewey's ice cream parlor. 
 And three days before, she... 
 Walked in high as a kite. 
 Said we had to cancel it because we couldn't afford it. 
 She'd spent all the money. 
 She wasn't even sorry. 
 And you left. 
 I didn't wanna be around her. 
 I, uh... 
 I came home a few hours later. 
 And she'd passed out with a cigarette in her hand. 
 It was still lit. 
 There was... a little flickering patch of carpet where the ambers were dropping. 
 I thought about leaving again. 
 What did you do? 
 I put it out. 
 The truth is... 
 I wanted her to die. 
 You really think you can help us? 
 I do. 
 How was your birthday? 
 Wasn't too bad. 
 Good. 
 I wish you'd told me about the divorce. 
 I am really sorry that I didn't tell you. 
 My life kinda blew up that night in Chicago. 
 And I never wanted to drag you into all this. 
 How are you doing? 
 I don't know. 
 Looking at a world full of question marks, trying to take care of everybody. 
 Figure out where I stand in the middle of it all. 
 Well... 
 It sure made for a pretty song. 
 I wanna do right by you. 
 Happy Birthday. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, hip-hop. Hey. 
 Something wrong with the guitar? 
 Nah, man. It sounds great. 
 Just... you know, impulse buy. 
 Yeah, no problem. Well, you wanna return it? 
 Yeah, but give me a second. I wanna look around. 
 See if something else feels right. Yeah. 
 All right, go on. 
 ♪ So I laid my body down ♪ 
 There's more? 
 Juliette asked me to drop off your birthday present. 
 Look, I know you had a lot to do with last night. 
 Oh, hell, you probably did all of it, so... thank you. 
 So you had a good time? 
 I did have a good time, yeah. 
 Don't tell her, though, okay? 
 I don't want this to become annual. 
 You got it. 
 "Happy Birthday." 
 "You of all people deserve some unconditional love. 
 P.S. He's welcome on the road." 
 Who's welcome on the... come here, buddy. 
 A dog? 
 Here. 
 I don't want a dog, Emily. 
 She said you'd say that. She also said to tell you to shut up and take the dog. 
 Hey, what am I supposed to do with this? 
 Love him, I think. 
 Mr. mayor. 
 Hey, there he is. Come on in, Cole. 
 Please have a seat. 
 I was beginning to think you were gonna stand me up. 
 Well, the thought did cross my mind. 
 I have to say, uh, sorry to hear about you and Rayna. Thank you. 
 I hope that's not the reason you asked me in today. 
 No, no, no. It's not. 
 Though in days gone by, I would've appreciated your friendship during all this. 
 Your counsel. 
 Well, if you're asking me to choose between you and Rayna, I'm team Rayna, even though I doubt she'd have me now. 
 Oh, she still cares about you, Coleman, and so do I. 
 I never imagined how ugly this would all get, and... for that, I'm truly sorry for you and Audrey and your family. 
 But you know, they say hindsight's 20/20, and I see things more clearly now, and I've given this a lot of thought. 
 I'd like you to be my deputy mayor, what? 
 I'm offering you the job. 
 Because, like you, I've now seen firsthand how Lamar does business, and I want no part of it, personally or for my constituents, and I'm pretty sure you feel the same way. 
 So... 
 What do you say? 
 Deputy mayor. 
 Where have you been since last night? 
 I've been calling... 
 What happened? 
 It's Jason. 
 Police found him in an alley last night... 
 Beaten to death. 
 Oh, Gunnar... 
 I kicked him out. 
 I got rid of his gun. 
 He had no way to defend himself. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Whose fault is it, then?
