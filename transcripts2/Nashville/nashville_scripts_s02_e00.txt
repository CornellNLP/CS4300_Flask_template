 Narrator : It's time to experience the music of Nashville like never before. 
 Yeah, Nashville! 
 Narrator : Hear the stories behind the songs. 
 Back where this whole journey started. 
 Where did that come from? 
 I have to prove to myself that I can do it. 
 Narrator : Then watch them performed by the stars of "Nashville" on stage at the historic Ryman Auditorium. 
 "Nashville on the Record" starts now. 
 ♪ Got the party goin' ♪ 
 Man : That's right, folks. 
 Performing in concert tonight at Ryman Auditorium, the mother church of music, the cast of "Nashville." 
 And they'll be joined by some of our finest songwriters here in Music City, and led by the man, the myth, the legend behind the music of "Nashville,"

 Gonna be a magical night, and if you're caller number 7...

 [Cheers and applause] 
 All right, thank you! 
 Thank you very much! 
 Thank you very much. 
 [Guitar strumming slowly] 
 Well, here we are at the Bluebird, which, I guess, is a bit of a fateful place for... back where it began. 
 Back where it began, back where this whole journey started. 
 Well, the first song that you had to sing... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, I was there when you guys met, right? 
 Is that when you actually met? 
 We met in the lobby of the Hutton Hotel. 
 I'd just flown into America for the first time ever. 
 Nashville was the first stop on my American adventure. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, I've never been. 
 And I'm waiting around to see who this mystical Buddy Miller is. 
 And five minutes later, the three of us were upstairs in one of the conference rooms there, and we thought we'd give this song its first shot. 
 I was nervous as all get-out about that song. 
 You were nervous? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
 Oh, you were nervous? [Laughs] They told me, "okay, now you got to go sing for Buddy Miller," and I was like... [Gasps, laughs] Oh, no. No, I was just nervous for Sam somewhat 'cause that song... that's a difficult song. I hadn't really used that part of my voice before. I didn't know whether it was gonna come out. It's so high. I don't even know if I could hear that high. [Laughs] So, we got a little conference room, you met, and, gosh, the blend of your two voices... it's so beautiful and unusual. And then we're in the studio the next day? That's what I was gonna say, yeah. And was it your two first time in a recording studio? I'd never used a microphone before. I remember... microphone. Oh, and that's what was so great about the session. In this town, anyway, you don't have to memorize song lyrics. Oh, yeah. I didn't know that. And you're singing a heavy love song, looking at each other. We were in the control room... everybody in there with goose bumps... and could not believe the moment 'cause it was so magical... Oh. And still is. Yeah. Well, we've had the best guidance, so thank you, because the show would not be what it is without you.

Narrator : When we return, more of your favorite songs, stories behind the music, and a special finale you won't want to miss. It's all right here with "Nashville on the record." The actors have had a lot of interplay with the songwriters, and sometimes we're singing one of their songs, and then they say, "hey, we should write together," and then you end up doing a... writing another song with that songwriter. And they're always on set, they're always a part of what's going on. I think it's a real unique environment for actors and songwriters to be collaborating like this. Man : One more time from the top, and then we'll go... ♪ Under the downtown neon lights ♪ 
♪ that's where you caught my eye ♪ 
♪ tonight ain't long enough ♪ 
♪ and I ain't leaving without your love ♪ 
♪ I ain't leaving without your love ♪ Sam Palladio: I guess you guys are very much the real-life Scarlett-and-Gunnar partnership. It goes back to the first song we ever had on "Nashville," which was called "When the Right One Comes Along." And you sang it here in the Bluebird, in the setting, and it was the most bizarre and cool thing because the first time we ever performed it was in the Bluebird Café. Wow. And so it's taken quite a journey, as have we. Yeah, for sure. [Chuckles] You know, awesome song... "I Ain't Leaving Without Your Love." How did it come together? It was our first time we ever tried to write anything. We had never even met Cary. It was our first date, so... [Laughter] The moment where I think we knew it was great... we came in on set, and, like, "let's just... let's run through this," 'cause we hadn't actually run through it together. And we just sounded amazing. You can sort of only imagine what it's gonna feel like... so being in the room together and trying it out, going, "wow. This is actually working." Yeah. All right, baby girl, have a great time, okay? Rock it out, sister. I'm excited. "Z"! "A"! "G"! All : Zag!

Narrator : When we come back, Hayden Panettiere takes the stage for her first-ever prime-time concert performance. Stick around for more "Nashville on the Record." I think when this show was first pitched, I think writers in the town were maybe like, "mm... What are you really gonna do?" And now they see that we really pay homage and we represent what this town is really about, so it's a great collaboration, and you feel that in the show. [Cheers and applause] [Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Panettiere : One of the things I've never asked you guys is how you came up with "Nothing in this World." It was the first time we ever wrote, and she was singing the melody and the words to the beginning of the chorus. She was singing it, and I was like, "yes, that is gorgeous." You know, this is old hat for you, but anything having to do with the stage is absolutely terrifying to me. And I've said... everybody's like, "oh, you have stage fright? How's that possible?" But I feel like this is a big leap of faith. I'm at the point where I have to prove to myself  that I can do it, I can get up there. And you so can. I've seen you in those positions where you were scared or you were, you know, unsure. Once you walk into that fear... and you've done it... you killed it, and you're gonna do the same thing. Well, I hope I don't let y'all down. Shine like the star that you are. Man : Miss Hayden Panettiere!

 [Indistinct conversations] Woman : That was fantastic. You did so, so, so, so good! [Panettiere laughs] Oh, my gosh! I can't believe I did it! Now you have the live bug. That's the live bug. Oh, God. Narrator : When we return, Hayden brings down the house, and Charles Esten and Clare Bowen take the stage for an unforgettable performance. "Nashville on the Record" will be right back. Peeples : Getting to do the regular "On the Record," it was just amazing 'cause you really get to strip down your song and do it acoustically, and it's really intimate. And so getting to do a whole concert of that is just incredible, and, plus, you're doing it at the Ryman, which is the best space ever for sound and just, you know, it's such a piece of history. [Laughs] Man : Clare Bowen! [Cheers and applause] Chip Esten! [Cheers and applause] Esten : I've said before that our show, in my mind, is, in some ways, a love letter to this city. But this song, "This Town"... I don't know if I'd call it a love letter. We wrote it in about an hour. It just... yeah, it poured out. It just comes from such a real place. I know at that point in my life, I was going through a very dark and frustrated place as a songwriter and as an artist. This industry can be crippling. And we all know that, and we're all sitting here now, and we're all very, very lucky to be sitting here. But we didn't come here without... there's no this. It's all like this. And this is like, "whoa." It's devastating. Rollins : "Nashville," the show... I think it's opened up so many doors for songwriters like us, and I'm grateful for that. Well, I'm very grateful... I was actually lucky enough to write with these guys after that. I took that opportunity. We wrote with Clare, as well. Yeah. You wrote, as well, with them. So, yeah. And in fact, we did a writers round right here. Basically where we are now, and you stepped over, and you did a song with me, so it's just where this reality you know, and the show sort of overlap so many times. I don't mean to interrupt, but I just have to say that I'm very excited to see you guys perform at the Ryman. [Both laugh] To see that song being performed on that stage is just going to be something very special. Might bring a few tears. [Chuckles] Probably definitely. ["This Town" plays] ♪ Hold on ♪

I mean, how do you write a song... start out a song with that first line, "thought things couldn't get any worse, but guess what... they did"? That's how you start out a song? [Laughter] It sounds like sort of a downer. You didn't write it for the sh... well, we actually wrote the song on Skype. I was living in Minneapolis at the time, and Trent was in Nashville. I was listening to the radio, which people actually do still. I listened to the radio, and skimming through, there was some sports talk show, and the guy was like, "well, don't put dirt on his grave just yet." While sitting in the writers room, this story line came up where Juliette has to... and it's basically going to be the "go to hell" song. So I was like, "oh, my God. This is absolutely perfect." I'm so excited to be a part of this and to play at the Ryman Auditorium. Which is the most sacred place to play music. What's better than music you love with the people you love? Have either of you ever performed in the Ryman? 'Cause I know that that's kind of a big deal for songwriters. No, it's my first time. I've never, so... That's exciting. Yeah. You're gonna love it.

Clare Bowen: There is nothing like walking out onstage and telling hundreds of people a story and watching their faces change and watching them feel something because of what you're giving them. That's the coolest thing in the world. This is, like, my favorite thing in the whole world to do. [Chuckles] Oh, my goodness. "Black Roses." You've written something so beautiful, and it means something different to everyone who hears it. It's like, everybody has a different kind of black rose. Yeah, that was interesting 'cause I wrote it, and I actually didn't think that it would be for a mother and daughter. I was thinking it would be a romantic story where there's, like, a tumultuous relationship, as there are in "Nashville." [Chuckles] And just with music in general, I think everyone takes something different from a song and it connects to their own life. Yeah. And that's sort of what's beautiful about making music. I'm so excited to have you up there with me. Like, I can't imagine a better person to be playing it. Aww. I'm really excited, too. I'm a little bit nervous, but mostly excited. It's the Ryman.
