 Previously on "Nashville"... 
 I'm Will. I just moved in upstairs. 
 Gunnar. Nice to meet you. 
 This is my girlfriend Scarlett. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Mama had a "friend." 
 You mean like an affair? 
 Call this guy for a roadie gig. 
 We spend so much time trying to keep out the bad that we end up missing out on the good. 
 Scarlett? You got yourself a record deal. 
 Sign the damn contract, please. 
 How do you think Teddy would feel if he knew it was you who leaked all those lies about Rayna? 
 Here's to our new baseball stadium. 
 (Albert) Lamar? 
 (Gasps) 
 Lamar? 
 (Gossling's "Heart Killer" playing) 
 ♪ I'm known as a killer ♪ 
♪ a heart killer ♪ 
♪ I'll have it so you don't know ♪ 
♪ I'm nothing but a mean foe ♪ 
♪ I'm gonna be your partner ♪ 
♪ you're love partner Are you tired? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 (Laughs) Good. 
 (Laughs) 
 But we should probably talk about your mother. 
 That's a mood killer. 
 I'm sorry, but I crossed the line, and before I cross it again, I... I think we should think this through. 
 Unless, of course, this is a one time thing. 
 Well, do you want it to be? 
 No. I thought you might. 
 You've read too much of my bad press. 
 I should probably resign as your mom's sober companion. 
 She is so fragile. 
 Maybe we should just keep whatever's going on between us quiet till she's a little stronger. 
 Not the healthiest plan. 
 You got a better idea? 
 No. 
 Well, then I guess we're done talking about my mama. 
 (Whispers) Are we? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Knock on door) 
 (Knock) 
 (Exhales) 
 (Sighs deeply) 
 Hey. It's the middle of the night. 
 We got a family emergency. 
 I gotta get my girls back to Nashville. 
 Are they okay? 
 They... they're fine. It's, um, their grandfather. 
 And I was just gonna ask you if I might... 
 My jet's at Teterboro. 
 I'll just tell 'em you're on the way. 
 Thanks. 
 You're gonna be back for the show tonight, right? 
 I don't know. I might have to cancel. 
 A... a sold-out show in New York? 
 I'll let you know. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. 
 All right. I'll see you in a bit. 
 (Cell phone clatters) 
 (Peggy) What? 
 (Sighs) Lamar had a heart attack. 
 Rayna's on her way back with the girls. 
 I gotta meet 'em at the airport. 
 Is it serious? 
 You know, I don't know. He's in cardiac I.C.U. 
 But the... the girls are really upset. 
 They'll all be coming back. 
 Right. I... I'll get my things together. 
 Okay. 
 (Sighs) 
 Who was ringing the doorbell at the crack of dawn? 
 Uh, that was a messenger picking up my contract at 9:40 A.M. 
 Okay. (Laughs) 
 Does that mean it is a done deal? 
 You and Edgehill Records? 
 I guess so. 
 Good, because that means I do not have to waste... this. 
 (Laughs) Oh, baby. If I start drinking now... 
 (Refrigerator door closes) 
 I'm not gonna get anything done. 
 Ah-ah! 
 That attitude will not be tolerated. 
 But you can go get me a couple glasses. 
 This is gonna be a celebration day. 
 (Giggles) 
 (Cork pops) Ooh! 
 Ahh. And by the way, this is step one of a two-step process. 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Step two involves... (Clears throat) 
 Well, it involves the bedroom. 
 I'll tell you about that later on. 
 (Laughs) 
 But if I go back to bed, I think it's gonna just be to sleep, 'cause you were thrashing around all last night. 
 I was? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You having bad dreams about Jason? 
 You wanna talk about it? 
 I do not wanna talk about what I can't remember. 
 So, today is about you, and it's about celebrating your success. 
 So I'm calling it the 24-hour Scarlett O'Connor party. 
 Bottoms up. Oh, yeah. 
 Oh... 
 ♪ 
 That's a good dog. 
 (Whimpers) 
 I wish I could just go with you. 
 Just take me with you. 
 (Laughs) 
 It's only a week. You'll be fine. 
 You'll live. 
 It's a week too long. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Oh, wait. I got something... 
 I gotta go. 
 Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. 
 Uh... 
 What is that? You want me to water your plants? 
 I don't have any plants. All right? 
 I just want you to make yourself at home. 
 Well, I have a home. 
 Now you got a key to mine. 
 (Laughs) 
 Call me when you land, all right? 
 Hey. 
 Yeah. 
 (Engine turns over) 
 (Indistinct conversations continue) 
 (Car door closes) 
 (Knocks on window) 
 Avery? What are you doing here, man? 
 Uh, I'm with the tour. 
 What, are you opening? 
 No, I'm a roadie. 
 I thought you had a... a deal and a song on the radio and everything? 
 Yeah, well, not anymore. 
 (Man) Hey, kid. Whatever your name is. 
 Name's Avery. 
 Whatever. 
 Hold up on that. Take that stuff back inside. 
 Good chance tonight's show is canceled. 
 Wait. Hold on. Wait, wait. Canceled? 
 Rayna's dad's in the hospital. Guess it's pretty bad. 
 I hate hospitals, ever since mom died. 
 Please don't go there. 
 Daddy's a fighter. He's gonna be fine. 
 Nothing else. 
 And, you know, mom just got taken away from us too soon. 
 Tandy. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Um, you know what? 
 Let me just talk to him really quick. 
 Why don't you go in and start this? 
 Okay. 
 (Sighs) 
 I wanna give him an update on the stadium deal. 
 Uh, but they said family only. 
 Albert. Albert. 
 Do you really think I care about this right now? 
 Please, let me just go with my sister. 
 You're C.F.O. You should care about this. 
 God knows your father would want you to. 
 (Monitor beeping rhythmically) 
 Hey. 
 Where's Tandy? 
 She's out talking to Albert. 
 I thought you were on the road. 
 I was. I had the girls with me, so... 
 I must be in pretty bad shape for you to miss a show. 
 Well, they were worried. 
 So I was worried. 
 But I can see that you're all full of piss and vinegar, so you must be feeling better. 
 That's right. I am. 
 There's no need for you to stop what you're doing. 
 I mean, the show must go on, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I will let Tandy know that you would like to see her. 
 You take care, daddy. 
 Just because Rayna had to cancel does not mean that I should have to. 
 This is the final night in the biggest country music market there is, and I was supposed to close. 
 I thought we were having a therapy session. 
 She's dealing with a career crisis here, okay? 
 And mani-pedis help her think. 
 You know, Marshall, you keep telling me that you have this roster full of talented people. 
 Would you just find someone to sub? 
 Wasn't this your solo tour to begin with? 
 Seriously. 
 I mean, it's bad enough that my fans have to sit through her show to get to mine. 
 And I just checked. 
 Your new single's had 50,000 downloads since midnight. 
 I don't know why they can't just get a local act to open up for you. 
 I would just expand my set. 
 Dante, can I talk to you for a minute? 
 I can put a few more songs in there. 
 Talk to the audience about 'em, get 'em excited about the new album. 
 Maybe even negotiate a little extra cash as the night's sole performer. 
 You know, will you tell Deacon that he needs to get the band up to speed on the new stuff? 
 (Keypad beeping) 
 I got it. 
 What were you saying, mama? 
 I took a bottle of vodka from the honor bar last night. 
 Well, I didn't drink it, but I tried to call you, and you didn't answer. I... 
 We need to focus on my therapy. 
 And I think it's time that Dante and I go home. 
 Hey, it's Rayna. Leave me a message. 
 I'll get right back to you. Thanks. (Voice mail beeps) Hey, it's me. Um, listen, I'm real sorry to hear about your dad. They say you might be canceling tonight, so that must mean it's pretty bad. I know this whole thing... has got to be pretty complex for you, to say the least. I just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you. Uh, okay. Bye. Hey. We canceling or not? Not. Juliette's gonna go on. Of course she is. Juliette wants the band to have these ready by the time we go on tonight. What, ten new songs? She said they weren't new to you, and she's keeping it simple. New guy. We're missing a set of Juliette's ears. Check her hotel suite. If it's not there, check the venue. Her dressing room. Bathroom. Tour bus. Anywhere you think to look. Okay. Hey, you know, I thought I'd be more of a load-in guy. Well, right now, you're a do-what-you're-told guy. Find the ears. Yes, sir. ♪ (Indistinct conversations) (Juliette) Thanks, Bo. You really need to pick up the pace next time. Well? Well, I talked your mom off the ledge. She's in the greenroom journaling right now. I told her I'd circle back in a little while. Good. I'm gonna need you to come to rehearsal with me. Apparently, the band's not thrilled about adding the new songs. Too bad. You're the boss. That's right. I am the boss. Yes, you are. (Hinges squeak) Damn, girl, you ever gonna get up? Probably not. What you razzing me for? You're the one who got me back in here. (Giggles) 'Cause we were supposed to be celebratin'. Aah! (Giggles) Come on! Mwah. So... what do you wanna do the rest of the day, huh? Mm... This, please? Will you write with me? We haven't done it in ages. You know, I'm not really in the mood... if that's all right. And I call this work, and we're supposed to be partying anyway. So... (Laughs) How about we go listen to some music instead? Okay. Yeah? You wanna bring Will, too? You guys got on really well the other night. Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Mm. What in the hell good is it to finance an entire hospital wing when I can't even get a damn milk shake when I want it? These people are not your employees. (Monitor beeping rhythmically) You heard anything from the Governor? Yes. He's gonna talk to Teddy about his plan for Subway Field. Talk? Yeah. He'd better tell Teddy there's only one location for that stadium, and it's on our land. (Cell phone rings) Ahem. Oh, no. (Ring) No. No more business. You need to rest. This is ridiculous. I don't belong in here. Okay, daddy, daddy... And I damn sure don't need you treating me like I'm a child. Okay. Back in this bed right now. (Groans) You had a heart attack. (Pants) And if you do not stay in this bed, I'm gonna call someone in here with a sedative so fast, that your head's gonna spin. (Amplified voice) ♪ 'cause we are water, we flow and flow ♪

I can't hear myself. And what I can hear sucks. Come on. Get the other earphones. Guys, I know that y'all don't know the songs yet, but it's ten songs. Ten. That's it. Okay? It's not that hard. It's not that hard. All right, you know what? Let's take a quick break here, guys. Uh, we have a show in five hours. We do not have time to take a break. I know when the show is, all right? I just wanna talk to you a second. Yes. You're asking an awful lot out of all these people here, you know? I'm asking for one day. Yeah, well, I just don't... One day. That's not a lot... not now. I don't understand. Why didn't you just have another act come in, huh? Or just cancel the damn thing like anybody else would. Why should I have to cancel? Because what you're doing, expanding your set this much, this close to showtime, is crazy. It's not crazy. I don't think it's crazy. I do. Dante doesn't think it's crazy. Dante? What, your mother's sober companion Dante? That Dante? Well, hell, why don't we see what your, uh, cable guy thinks? Why don't we let him weigh in, you know? You're hilarious. Hilarious. No, I'm serious. Why does he have any say about what's going on out here? Because I asked him to. Why did you ask him? Because he's helping me! How is he helping you? By being your yes-man? Saying "yeah" to any idea you've got in your head? By helping me get an endorsement deal that's gonna help my album... An endorsement deal. Skyrocket to the top of the charts? By renegotiating my deal so I can get paid as a solo headliner? What does any of this have to do with music or what we're doing up here, Juliette?! By having my back because he's obviously the only person around here who does! Really? Yeah. I'm sorry you feel that way. Let's get back to work, guys. We got 10 songs to learn in 20 minutes. You know what? Y'all let me know when you got it together. I'll be in my bus. Yes, ma'am. (Man speaks indistinctly) Hi. Hey. Hey, Ray. You are so sweet. Aw. I got your sweet message. Thanks for coming. Yeah, well, I thought you might need somebody to lend an ear or a shoulder. I got both. Mm, I don't want you worrying about me. Well, he's no spring chicken. You know, a heart attack's pretty serious. Yeah, well, true... (Lamar) This is ridiculous! But this is daddy we're talking about. I don't belong here! Also true. (Lamar and woman speaking indistinctly) That sounds like him right now. That's all right. I don't need your help. I can leave of my own accord. Daddy, are you trying to kill yourself? (Groans) (Woman) Oh, sir, please. Do you realize I can pull my funding and have you fired like that? All right, get him... Yes, I know. Daddy, what is going on? You need to sit down right now. I fell asleep for five minutes, and he just runs away. What in the hell is he doing here? I didn't come to upset you, Lamar. You get the hell out of here now! Hey. Sir, please sit down. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go. (Lamar) Now! All right, down. Sit down. Please sit down! (Rayna) Good heavens. (Man) All right, that's good. Just... (Woman speaks indistinctly) (Scoffs) (Woman) ♪ stupid love is stupid ♪ Thank you. You're welcome. But why am I the only one drinking? I had a beer. How about you, Mr. soda pop? I like to live vicariously, I guess. I think he stays sober to pick up the ladies. Oh, you know how many numbers he's got in his little black book? There's a black book? Oh, yeah. There's 2,000 numbers. No, no, he exaggerates. It's 1,900. (Chuckles) That's actually kinda icky. (Clink) I'm not saying I call 'em all. Just, uh, consider it more a hobby. (Laughs) He says he can pick up a girl three minutes flat. Three minutes flat? Mm-hmm. I have to see. Go do your magic now, please. I want to see it. All right. (Scarlett laughs) Go. Let's see, uh, watch and learn, Junior. Redhead, 2:00. Oh, my God. He's crazy. (Gunnar) Yeah, but I kinda like him. Excuse me, miss. Did I follow your band? But is he a good influence on you? Hey, you don't have to worry about me, 'cause I am taken. (Laughs) Mwah. What the hell's he doing? I don't know. (Amplified voice) Hey, y'all. How you doin'? Uh... my name's Will, and I'm here tonight celebratin' my friend's new record deal with none other than Ms. Rayna Jaymes. Mm? All right! (Cheers and whistles) That's right! Now my friend Scarlett O'Connor... right back there... she's, uh, she's a little bit shy, but, uh, heck, I think we should hear her sing while it's still free of charge. What do y'all say? (Cheering) Yeah? All right. Come on now. Keep it going for Scarlett! Come on. Bring her up here. Bring her up here. Yeah! All right! Whoo! (Amplified voice) Hello. My very handsome writing partner is sitting right over there. Gunnar, will you come up with me? I'm good. You take it away. Uh, um... You know that, uh, Ashley Monroe/Vince Gill song, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Y'all know that? Thanks, guys. (Whispers) Hold that for me. (Clears throat) (Normal voice) Now y'all might have heard this one.

 Excuse me, Miss Barnes. Uh, I found your ear monitors. Thanks. Where were they? Wardrobe rack. Are you new? First day. Where do I know you from? You look familiar. I don't know. Nashville's a small place. Huh. It'll come to me. (People speaking indistinctly) You coming? Yeah, I'll be right there. Hey. Don't you think you should knock before you barge onto your boss' tour bus? I'm really sorry about that. I'm sorry, but that's not gonna be good enough. We're gonna have to let you go. Excuse me? You're fired. (Rayna) Hey. (People speaking indistinctly) I... am so sorry. I have no idea what that was all about. I think he might be a little delirious or something 'cause of the meds. Yeah. And all of it. (Sighs) What? Your mother was an incredible woman, but she wasn't easy on the men in her life. Your mother and I were together. You were the musician? (Gasps) I think I've gotta sit down. Look... Is that why you helped me? No, no, no, no. That was 'cause of your talent. You need to hear this. He loved your mother. We both did. She was... young and impulsive and... beautiful. But trying to hold on to her was like trying to hold on to a butterfly. And he knew it. That didn't stop him from trying, but he knew it. And... the night she crashed that car... her bags were packed. Rayna, she was desperate to break free. (Phosphorescent) ♪ see, I was the wounded master ♪ I'm actually really worried about him. He doesn't sleep. He doesn't write music anymore. He hasn't really written anything since his brother died. I mean, not like what you guys were writing in the backyard that time. It's different. His music is... ♪ And I was the holy lion ♪ I'm just glad you guys are friends. I don't know what's gonna happen if I have to go on the road or something with this... with this Edgehill thing. You gonna be a big star, that's what's gonna happen. (Giggles) Yeah, you are. Here. Come on. Let's, uh, let's take a quick photo. What? This way, I can say I knew you when. Oh, you're funny. (Camera shutter clicks) Fries are up. Oh, God. Thank you. (Mouth full) Will you take a photo of all three of us? You have long arms. Yeah, sure. Mm. Get in here. Hmm. (Giggles) (Camera shutter clicks) Looks like you got a voice mail from Bucky Dawes. Who's that? He is Rayna Jaymes' manager. Sorry. (Beeps) Now that's a number I wouldn't mind getting. Oh, my God. (Beep) Rayna just got into town. She wants to meet me tomorrow. Uh-oh. (Laughs) Well, I think we might have to get you home. Will you carry me? I will try. (Laughs) Oh, my God. Come on. Give me your hand. (Laughs) Floor's moving. Whoops. That way? Whoa. Okay. (Monitor beeping rhythmically) Hey. Hey. He hasn't made a single move since you left. He's probably just embarrassed by all this. He's a proud man. (Mouths word) I wanna talk to you about something. (Monitor beeping erratically) (Woman) I need some help in here. What? (Beeping continues) He's in v-fib. Get the crash cart. What? Is he okay? (Man) Somebody grab those leads. Step out of the way, please. Your father's having a cardiac arrest. (All speaking at once) I think he's having another heart attack. Can we stay? (Woman) I'm sorry. Can I get you to step out of the room? We'll take care of him. (Man) Keep the chest compressions going. Oh, you had enough already? Nah, man. I got the boot. For what? (Indistinct conversations) Nothing. Must've done something. All I did was see something. Juliette and that guy she hangs around with. Dante? Yeah. I saw 'em in a... compromising position, and then he saw me. (Indistinct conversations continue) Put your gear back on the bus. I'll handle him. What? Get back to work. What are you doing? Hmm? Who gave you the authority to fire roadies? I don't see how that's any of your concern. Well, how the hell is it yours, man? Avery's on the stage crew here. As far as I can tell, he hasn't done a damn thing wrong. That's not your call to make, okay? You're the bandleader. (Chuckles) Yeah, and you're supposed to be the damn sober companion to Juliette's mother. I don't remember the part of the program where you screw around with your client's daughter, but to me, it's just wrong on so many levels. Yeah, well, unlike you, what I'm doing is looking out for Juliette's best interests. Oh, that's a good euphemism for it. Pot calling the kettle, isn't it? What are you talking about? I just find it ironic that a guy who slept with her when she was at her most vulnerable and then takes a $50,000 guitar from her is lecturing me about ethics. (Scoffs) Are you kidding me? She tell you all that? Yeah. She trusts me. I don't. Till it comes down from Juliette, that kid Avery... he's back on this tour. You don't touch him. You don't talk to him. (people speaking indistinctly) Hey. (Sighs) How you doing? I'm not doing too good. I'm climbing the walls in here, and you said you were gonna be right back. I'm right here. Dante, I wanna go home... tomorrow or as soon as possible. I... I wanna go home with you. Jolene, this isn't about going home or drugs or alcohol. This is about Juliette, and we both know it. You're jealous that I've been spending time with her and helping her with her career, and... and you need to work through that. You can't just run away from it. (Sighs) When was the last time that we had a therapy session? Yeah, well, Juliette doesn't wanna help me, and clearly, neither do you. Now, Jolene, that's... That's not true. I care about you. You do? Of course I do. You're... you're important to me. Then why don't you show me then? I want... What? You are disgusting. Juliette. Baby, I'm... Juliette. Don't touch me! Baby, I have feelings for him. I'm sorry. And I think he has feelings for me, too. I... No... You are unbelievable. Okay, I did not bring Dante here to be your plaything. Okay, I brought him here to help you. You brought him here to help me, and you've stolen him from me. He was never yours. Look, I think we need to go back in the room before this escalates, okay? Oh, my God. You're sleeping with him. And you call me disgusting? (Door slams) (Crickets chirping) (Whispers) She is passed out cold. (Sighs) (Chuckles) (Groans) The night's still young. Feel like making some music? Uh... No. Not really, man. I'm... I haven't felt like it since... my brother died. Yeah. I don't know. I think I'm just tired. I haven't been sleeping too good. Look, I... I don't know what it's like to lose a brother. But I do know what it feels like to lose family. Yeah, then you know that I'm not feeling much of anything right now. Just kinda... empty, I guess, about everything. Not Scarlett. (Chuckles) Nope. (Chuckles) (Chuckles) No, not her. Pretty much everything else, though, man, music included. (Snaps fingers) I tell you what. Scarlett may have had enough fun for one night, but you... Shh. (Lowered voice) But y... you sure as hell have not. No. (Laughs) All right? Looks good on you. Come on, cowboy. Hey, look. I'm not interested in chasing skirts. That's not what I had in mind. I think these will make your pawpaw feel better. (Exhales) When can we see him? You know, I'm not sure. Your mom said she'll call when, uh, when it's time. (Cell phone rings) (Ring) Hi. Hi. I'm sorry to call you at home. I know you're with the girls. No, it's okay. Something wrong? You sound upset. I just... I wanted you to know that I am here for you in this. I just care about you so much, and it's important to me that... that you know that, Teddy. I love you. Yeah, well, I... I feel the same. I do. (Sniffles) Good. Well, I know you have your hands full. I... I'll let you go. No, o... okay. Yeah. I'll... I'll, um, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Yeah, bye. Oh, hey. How is he? The bypass surgery went well. But there were some complications. Meaning what? He had some severe hemorrhaging. We'll watch him closely for the next 24 hours. How long before we get to see him? He won't be conscious for some time. You should both go home and get some rest. Thank you. No problem. Why don't I stay with him for when he wakes up, and you go home and be with the girls? No, the girls are already asleep. Why don't I stay? You know, you go home. Yeah? I'll take it off your hands for a change. You know, I really could use a shower. Okay. Hey, did you know it was Watty? Why didn't you tell me when you told me about the affair? (Sighs) I didn't know how to tell you something like that. What do you remember about mom? She was a lot like you. And that's why daddy never said anything about it. No matter how much it hurt him and now matter how much it changed him, he worshiped her. You know, if you ever wonder why he was so screwed up... You should go get your shower. Okay. (Kiss) I love you. This is Deacon. Leave a message. Hey. Oh, you're probably in the middle of a show right now. (Shifts gears) What are we doing? (Train horn honking) The only true way to get over death... (Shifts gears) is to tempt it a little. (Engine revs, tires screech) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (Laughs) Yeah, very funny, Will. Slow down. (Crossing bells clanging) Will, stop the damn car. (Train horn blaring, crossing bells clanging) What are you doing?! Aah! (Crossing bells clanging) Aah! Aah! (Brakes squeal) Ah! Ha! Whoo! You crazy son of a bitch! (Laughs) That was the stupidest thing I've ever seen! We could be dead! We should be dead right now! But we're not! (Panting) No. (Crossing bells clanging) You wanna go again? (Cheering) (Amplified voice) Thank you, Brooklyn! And thank you so much to all the Rayna fans out there. I'm sorry she couldn't be here tonight, but we're gonna make it up to y'all. We've got some great new songs, and this is one of 'em. (Cheers and applause) ♪

It's been a pretty strange day today. I'm just hopin' I'm gonna get a chance to have another conversation with him. Anyway, I just wanted to call you to thank you for calling me, and, um, I... I'll talk to you. (People speaking indistinctly) What the hell was that? Look, if there's issues between us, you talk to me about 'em. I don't need your boy toy shrink knowing all my damn business. Wait. So you ignore me during my show... I didn't ignore you. Because I shared during a therapy session? Or is it because you're not my go-to guy anymore? Hey, trust me, I don't want to be your go-to guy. At this point, I barely wanna be your friend. Oh, when was the last time you were my friend? You got this guy running around firing people for no damn reason. You're getting the guys to learn songs on the fly, you're playing shows that should be canceled. I don't know what's... Why should I have to cancel my show?! Because that's what you do when there's a family emergency! You know what? Rayna is not my family. And let me tell you something. She ain't yours, either. Yes, she is. (Guitar strumming) ♪ 
♪ (Stops playing) What time did you get in? Mm. Around midnight. What time did I get in? Mm, around 8:30. (Chuckles) Mm. Yeah. Thank you for putting me to bed. That's all right. (Giggles) Come here. Mm. I had this terrible dream that I was supposed to meet with Rayna Jaymes today. Will you please tell me that was a dream? It wasn't a dream. Oh, my God. Mm-hmm. I don't know what I'm gonna do... If I'm gonna throw up or pass out or both at the same time. Oh. That's... that's really pretty. Did you write that this morning? Oh, I'm just playing around with something, yeah. Good. Mm. Mm. Keep going. Okay. 'Kay. (Exhales) And what were you doing out till midnight? Uh, just... you know, hanging out with Will. Just talking and stuff. Now you're playing again. Maybe he's not such a bad influence after all. Can I come in? Your mother isn't talking to me. Well, I'm not talking to her, either. I understand how you feel, Juliette. Do you understand? Because that makes one of us. I never meant to drive a wedge between you and your mom. You didn't. It was already there, trust me. I don't know. I just... maybe it's 'cause we both are looking for the same thing. I'm not the first guy that she's tried this with, am I? No. But you're gonna be the last. How's he doing? Rayna's with him. Gives me a little time to go over everything, just in case. We both know your dad's one stubborn son of a bitch. Death's gonna have to deal him a better hand than this to take him out of the game. Well, I don't disagree. But having said that, I need to know about every aspect of my father's life. Far as I can tell, you already do. Really? Then why is he getting phone calls from Peggy Kenter? (Sighs) (Monitor beeping rhythmically) (Bag thuds) Strangely, it feels like I know my mother better today and like I didn't know my father at all. Yeah, well, it's all through a different lens now, you know? Mm. Which makes sense. You were only 12 when your mom died. Things look different through the eyes of a 12 year old. Yeah. (Inhales deeply) What are the odds of a 16 year old getting kicked out of the house? I remember that. (Chuckles) (Monitor beeping rhythmically) That's when Watty brought you your first paying gig. That's right. (Laughs) No wonder my father got so furious at me. That was the biggest fight we had ever had. Kicked me out of the house. Way I remember it, he said that you were allowed to stay in his house but that you had to live by his rules. Well, that wasn't gonna happen. No. So you left. Guess I got that from my mom. I did have a mouth on me. Some things never change, I guess. Shut up. (Chuckles) Thank you for coming. I just heard somethin', you know, in your voice in that message. You just... s... sounded like you needed... me. I should go. Say hi to Stacey for me. You take care, Ray. (Elevator bell dings) Rayna offers her apologies. Oh, no. I... I heard what happened to Ms. Jaymes' father. I truly hope he's all right. I'll pass that along. The label is so excited about having you as part of the fold. They've already started talking producers and tours. Really? Mm-hmm. Come on. Oh, my goodness. (Chuckles) Everyone grab a glass of champagne. Scarlett, Bucky. Thank you. I would like to toast Scarlett O'Connor, a soon-to-be star, and the first artist to sign to Rayna's label. (All) Hear, hear. Thank you so much. It's... it's such a pleasure to be here.

So Emily's gonna take you back to Nashville like you wanted. Find you a nice apartment, a new sober companion... female, this time. And then, uh, after shows, I'll travel home and see you then. What, so Dante's not coming? You fired him? As your sober companion, yes. But I hired him as my manager. (Knock on door) Come on in. So is everything okay? How's Lamar? I didn't come here to talk about him. I came here to talk about you. What's this? Phone records between Peggy Kenter and the reporter who broke the story on your divorce. She was the leak, Teddy. Your girlfriend.
