 Previously on Nashville... 
 Give me the SD card. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm trying to fix this and I can't. 
 What do you mean? 
 I can't be around this. 
 How many times did I have to drag you out of hotel rooms, 'cause you were so wasted I didn't know if you were dead? 
 I found this paternity test, and I don't think that my dad, is my father. 
 No. No, no, no no. 
 Mama? 
 No! 
 We're still going through your mother's apartment. 
 Hopefully we'll find something that can shed some light. 
 But there was evidence of oxy usage in the apartment. 
 We also found a couple of vials of cocaine on Mr. Rivas. 
 Guess he turned out to be a... pretty lousy sober companion. 
 Yes, he did. 
 Could be a drug deal gone bad, but more likely a... a lovers' quarrel. 
 Were you aware of a romantic relationship? 
 No, but... (Scoffs) 
 I wouldn't put it past 'em. 
 Well, the autopsy's complete, so the body will be released to the funeral home today. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 (Woman) Juliette! 
 (Man) Juliette, will you still be going to the C.M.As? 
 (Reporters shouting indistinctly) 
 (Woman on TV) Singer Juliette Barnes offered no comment as she left the police station, but was clearly distraught by what's being characterized as a drug-fueled murder-suicide. 
 That's enough of that. 
 (TV turns off, remote control clatters) 
 (Sighs deeply) This is awful. 
 I feel so sorry for Juliette. 
 Yeah. No matter how old you are, it is a terrible thing to lose your mother. 
 Or your father. 
 Well, y'all aren't losing either one of us anytime soon. 
 So I guess she's not going to the C.M.A. Awards. 
 No, I wouldn't think so. 
 That's actually something I wanted to talk to y'all about. 
 Um... (Spoon clatters) so your Uncle Deacon has asked me to go with him... as his date. 
 So I wanted to tell you that we are seeing each other. 
 So is he your boyfriend now? 
 Duh. 
 Well, we care about each other a lot, so... yeah, I guess. 
 I wanna know how you feel about that. 
 I do like Deacon. 
 I like him. 
 Okay, 'cause, you know, if we go to the C.M.As together, they're gonna take all kinds of pictures of us, and your father and I are public figures, and you know people are very interested in our private lives. 
 And y'all are the most important part of my private life, so... 
 You know, they used to date. 
 When'd you guys date? 
 Right before she married dad. 
 Um... all right. So let's get goin'. 
 Here, grab these. 
 Thank you. 
 Jack? 
 Hey, man. 
 Gunnar. Hey. 
 (Taps key) Whoa. Little early, don't you think? 
 Yeah. I'm sorry about that. 
 What's on your mind, man? 
 Hey, I just... I just... 
 Oh, wait, wait, wait. You gotta... you gotta... you gotta see what I found last night. 
 Look at that. 
 Not exactly my proudest moment. 
 Yeah. Definitely a marketable one. 
 (Closes laptop) 
 Um... 
 (Exhales) That's not me. 
 "Gun for a mouth," this new song? 
 They're my brother Jason's lyrics. 
 It's his life, man. It's... it's his words. 
 He died a couple months ago. 
 I found the songs in his journal. 
 So you stole these? And that's not outlaw? 
 Come on, man, what are you worried about? You're fine. 
 No, man, it's an act. It's... I can't do it. 
 Look, my other material, that's what I'm... that's what I'm passionate about. 
 That's what feels real to me. 
 But I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in this. 
 Well, my girlfriend's not. 
 Okay, you're not serious. 
 What are you talking about? I am serious. 
 I mean, you're not serious about your career. 
 Don't be that guy who's gonna chuck it all away over some girl he's not gonna remember in ten years. 
 Don't be that guy. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Hey, just give me one second? 
 Okay. 
 Thanks, darlin'. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks again for bailing me out last night. 
 I suppose it was the least I could do since I asked you to help him. 
 Well, there's that. 
 Listen, after we got sprung, Gunnar spent the night on my couch. 
 Hightailed it out of there early in the mornin'. 
 Y'all should talk, try to figure things out. 
 (Whispers) Yeah. 
 (Normal voice) Hey. 
 (Avery) Hey. 
 (Exhales) Maybe you don't want to. 
 Hey there. Will Lexington. 
 Avery Barkley. 
 I'll let you get to it. 
 You really didn't have to do this, you know. 
 Well, you didn't have to turn up and, uh,  whisk my preshow nerves away. 
 I would've brought it back to you myself, but I thought Gunnar might've taken it the wrong way. 
 Nah, he wouldn't. He wasn't there. 
 You're kiddin'. 
 No. 
 Well, he missed a great show. 
 I mean, you were... you were truly great. 
 Thank you. 
 That actually means a lot coming from you. 
 Look, Scarlett, you're an artist. 
 You always have been. 
 I'm just... 
 I'm sorry that Gunnar's the one who brought it out in you, and not me. 
 I hope he's treatin' you right. 
 He's got a few things to work out, but, uh, I just needed a break. 
 (Clicks tongue) Oh. 
 Well, sorry to hear that. 
 (Laughs) No, you're not. 
 (Laughs) 
 So what are you doing? Are you playing around town or... what? 
 Yeah. I got a gig tonight, actually. 
 It's small but, you know... 
 Yeah. 
 You can come by if you want. 
 I can leave your name at the door. 
 (Whispers) Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How's she doing? 
 Not real great. (Exhales) 
 Hey. 
 Um, Deacon's here to see you. 
 Really? 
 Look, I know you and me been having our... problems, but... 
 I still care about you. 
 And you know I cared about your mom. 
 I tried to tell you,  but you had to drag me through it again, didn't you? 
 I knew she would never stay clean. 
 I'm sorry. You just... you called, so I wanted to help her if I could, and... 
 Why don't you stop trying to help people who can't be helped? 
 If there's anything I can do... 
 Yeah. You can leave so I can get ready. 
 (Whispers) For what? 
 I'm gonna win female vocalist of the year tonight. 
 Juliette, you don't have to go... 
 (Slams door) 
 (Man over intercom) Mr. Mayor, there's a Dashell Brinks on the phone? 
 (Beeps) 
 Dashell Brinks, how the hell are you? 
 Well, hello, Mr. Mayor. I'm good. 
 Ah, it's been a hundred years. What are you up to these days? 
 Well, I'm with the U.S. Attorney's office. 
 I wish I could say this was a social call. 
 Well, what can I help you with? 
 Well, I need to talk to ya about a federal audit of the music city credit union where you were on the board, um, and specifically, a loan for the Cumberland Plaza project. 
 Is there a time that we could speak in person? 
 Um, yeah, yeah, anytime. 
 Just, uh, set an appointment with my assistant. 
 Be great to see you, Dash. 
 Well, I look forward to it. 
 (Line disconnects) 
 (Hangs up receiver) 
 (Knock on door) 
 (Chuckles) Hey. 
 What are you doing here? You okay? 
 (Voice breaking) I think... 
 What is it? 
 I think that you might be my father. 
 (Whispers) What? 
 (man over P.A.) Coming up on the "Country Music Association Awards"... 
 Rayna Jaymes and Brad Paisley. I don't know where the hell Deacon is. He was supposed to pick me up. Deacon's a pro. He'll be here. Well, he was also supposed to be my date. You're seriously ready to go public with this thing? I was. I guess he's not. (Door opens) I got you these 'cause I know you don't like roses. (Chuckles) So... Gunnar, please don't do that. You were right. I took that whole image thing way too far. So I spoke to Jack and, uh, told him the truth. So can we start over and forget this all happened? You can't just walk in here with... pretty flowers and your hair combed right and... make it all better like that. Well... I'm trying to fix it. (Chuckles) I know. W... what more do you want? I don't know. I don't know what I want. I'm not even sure what we had. I have to go. Gonna be late. Uh, where you going? See an old friend play at 7th & Fogg. I'll see you later. (Door opens) (Door closes) (Indistinct conversations) (Sighs) I heard you came in the back way. How you holding up? I'm fine. You sure? Did I sound unsure? What are you doing here? (Scoffs) Juliette, come on. You shouldn't do this. Would y'all get out of my dressing room? I'm trying to get ready. Look, I just don't think you're in the right head space for a night like this. What, are you afraid that I'm gonna lose it on live TV?! Huh?! You afraid I'm gonna have some sort of meltdown?! My mother was the drug addict/murderer, not me! She has taken enough of my life, and she is not gonna take this, not when I have fought this hard to get here! I know exactly how hard you've fought. I know all the stuff you had to fight against. Don't jeopardize it all now by going out there. You need to take the time to grieve. Grieve? What are you talking about? I should be celebrating that's it finally over! (Gasps) (Whispers) Oh, my God. I... I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that. Juliette, can I take you home? No. I... I'll go. (Indistinct conversations) (Sighs) Whoa! Oh! (Chuckles) Hey. You heard of knockin'? I'll, uh, yeah, I'll come back. No, no, no. Just, uh... Hang on. Just give me a sec. Uh, maybe you oughta go get changed, darlin'. (Woman) Okay. Uh, we are low on... stuff. All right, you're good. (Lowered voice) Man, you know, I can go for a walk. (Chuckles) No, no, man. You're fine. (Belt buckle clinking) What's with all the girls? (Jeans rustling) I mean, I thought you said you were... Gonna be the next big thing in country music? You're damn right I am. All right. Oh, anyway, this is, uh... Gwen. Hi. Gunnar. Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Gunnar's having a little fight with his girlfriend, so he's bunking with me. Might be a while, though. I saw her out with her ex. Out with Avery? At Garden Cafe, having a meal. Which I owe this young lady. So... you make yourself at home. Yeah. I... I will. (Chuckles) Yeah. We're gonna grab some grub. Yeah. See you in a bit. Pleased to meet ya. (Door closes) No, no, no, no. (Chuckles) Hey! There she is. Now how I am supposed to sing with you wearing that? Ah! (Laughs) You'll manage. You ready? I think so. Band's not. Where's Deacon? Right here. You know, we're the ones allowed to be late here. (Chuckles) Sorry. Hey. Hey. I thought you were picking me up. I got waylaid. (Man) Mr. Claybourne? Right this way. (Indistinct conversations) Is he okay? I think we're all  just a little bit rattled... (Man over P.A.) Ladies and gentlemen... about the whole Juliette thing. Once again, Carrie Underwood! Ah, I'll bet. (Carrie) From her soon-to-be released album "The Parts I Remember," here's Rayna Jaymes and Brad Paisley singing "Bitter Memory." (Cheers and applause) ♪

She wants to know if I'm her father. She found this, uh, report, and it said that Teddy wasn't. So, I need you to tell me that... it's not true. Tell me that you haven't been lying to me every moment of the last 13 years. (Inhales deeply) (Exhales deeply) How is it possible, huh? Can... you wanna start by telling me that? I'd say that the fact that you can't remember... is exactly how it's possible. What does that have to do with you not telling me that she was mine? Try to remember how you were at that time. I remember. I remember, Rayna. I got sober. I know. You did get sober. But it took you five times in rehab, and you... you... (Whispers) No. You know, you broke every stick of furniture in my apartment. You're not answering my question here, okay? I am answering your question. (Clears throat) I found out I was pregnant. (Voice breaking) I ended up talking about it with Teddy, and we... we decided that we were gonna get married and we would do a paternity test after we were married. And then Coleman said that I should cut you loose because we wanted you to get better. (Sighs deeply) And he thought that would... be the way to do that. So then Teddy and I... we made a decision to do what was best for Maddie... (Whispers) She's mine? (Whispers) Yeah. Deacon? Deacon! Ms. Jaymes? You're on in 40 seconds. (Indistinct conversations) Hey. Hey, Rayna. Listen, I need you to come over to the house, please. I thought you were still at the C.M.As. Maddie knows. She what? How? I don't know how she found out, but she did. Y... you gotta be kidding me. Right now I need you to be my partner in this because we're gonna have to get her through it, okay?

 (crying) So Deacon's my dad? Now, honey, biologically, yes, but no. Oh! I am your dad, and I always will be. There's a difference... But you're both to Daphne. It... honey, it doesn't matter. He loves you the same way he loves your sister. The decisions that we made at that time were because we loved you so much, because... That's right. We wanted the best for you. How could you marry her if you knew that she was pregnant by somebody else? Because, honey, we didn't know that was the case at first. And... and I loved your mother very much and decided that it didn't matter. It doesn't matter who my real father is? No, honey, that's not what I'm say... It's so hard to understand, and it was such a complicated situation. No, I understand it all. You lied to Deacon and to me. Daddy, I wanna live with you. Okay, honey. No, come on, please. Maddie... No, this is all your mistake... my even being born. (Zips bag) So... (Sobbing) Honey, no... That's not true, honey. Rayna, hold... Maddie. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Now listen... What do... what?! Just listen. Just... look, if she needs to work through it this way, then let her do it. You promised me that I wouldn't lose her. I'm promising you the same thing. I've been saying for years, if you wanna make this interesting, let's not vote for 'em. Let's let 'em wrestle. And the nominees for female vocalist of the year are Rayna James...

In order to keep the company afloat and my investors from losing their shirts, Peggy helped me borrow some money. In other words, you embezzled money from a credit union together. Look, there's no reason to hold back, not from your lawyer, anyway. So how much money are we talking about? $2 million. (Sighs) Which I paid back in full years ago. But after my mayoral campaign began, they started an audit. It got handled, or so I thought. By whom? Lamar Wyatt. I assume he bribed the auditor. Well, we might be able to cut a deal for you if we can tie him to it. Well, I'm pretty sure he was the one who tipped off the feds in the first place, which he wouldn't do unless he knew he was untouchable. I know, Walter. I... I screwed up. I mean, worst-case scenario, what is it? Well, they find the smoking gun. They indict. We go to trial. We lose, and you go to federal prison. But they have to find that smoking gun first. My guess is that they'll try and do that through Peggy Kenter. (Sighs) (Voice breaking) He's not returning my phone calls. He's not picking up his phone. I don't know where he is, and I have a bad feeling. I think he's in trouble, and if he goes into this cycle again, it will destroy him. It will destroy us. Don't worry. Look, I would've hoped that he would have called me first. I don't know. You gotta help me find him, Cole. Just understand, Rayna, that if he's been drinking, it's best that I go out there and I find him on my own. Please trust me on this. I do. Hey. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. You won. (Award clatters) Anything else? Yeah. It's me again, just got to this funeral, and... I'm really, really hoping I'm gonna see you here. Deacon, please call me. Please, I'm begging you. I... (Sighs deeply) I love you, babe. I just... I need to talk to you. I hope I'm gonna see you. Hey! Hey! Oh! What the hell is wrong with you? You stole my life! What are you talking about? No one stole anything from you! You stole my... my daughter! You weren't capable of being a father! You know what? You never were! You haven't changed... You have no right! You don't know me! Oh, I know you! Look at you. You're a loser! You're belligerent! (Shouts indistinctly) You're drunk! She's mine! Maddie deserved better, and so did Rayna! (Grunting) Rayna deserved a thousand times better than you! You had no right! You stay away from my family. You hear me? Let him go. Get him outta here. (Panting) (Man) Take it easy. Come on. Get up. Get off of me! I lost my mom, too, you know. Different circumstances, you know? But I have some idea how it feels. Yeah, you don't know what it was like to grow up with a mom like that. I grew up in the dirt. (Whispers) Everything was filthy. And now I get to put her back in the dirt. I just lived my life knowing that this day was gonna come. Dreading it. Wanting it. Hating myself for wanting it. I guess I just always thought that if I was good enough... that she would be all right. And I tried to be good. But I was always gonna fail. I was never gonna be good enough. That's not true. You're good enough. (Sighs) Do you, uh, do you know if Deacon's coming? I don't. (Retching and coughing) Deacon? (Vomiting) Hey, man. Hey, you all right? Yeah, I'm good. Yeah? You sure? I'm fine. Yeah. My, uh... my key, uh... doesn't work in my door. (Coughs) It won't open. Oh. (Chuckles) Thank you. Thank you. It was stuck. You've been drinking? (Bottles clink) What do you want? Uh, I... Why are you here? I just needed some advice on Scarlett, that's all. Uh... I don't have advice. Look, you... you need a hand getting... in? (Sighs) Hey, yeah, it's me. Uh, I think you need to get your uncle's sncnsor to his house right away. (Minister) Lord, our God, you are always faithful and quick to show us mercy, but our hearts are broken. Jolene was taken from us so suddenly. So come swiftly to her aid. Have mercy on her, and comfort her family and her friends by the power of the cross. We ask this through Christ our lord. We commend to almighty God, Jolene. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. May the lord bless her and keep her. May the lord make his face to shine upon her. May the lord be gracious to her and give her peace. Amen. Hey. Mm. Hey. I'm so sorry. I... I didn't know that this was private. I'm glad you came. I actually have a favor to ask. Anything. I just came by to talk to him about somethin', and, uh, he was wasted. I tried to get in, but... Deacon? Deacon, open up! It's Cole. (Deacon) Go away! (Loud clatter) Wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell are you doing? Get out of my house. What are you doing? I don't want you in my house! Deacon, what happened? Just... just tell me what happened. You brought her here? Why would you bring her here? He didn't know what to do. He's trying to help you. You want some advice. I'll give you some advice. Get away from her. You're not good enough. (Coleman) Deacon, Deacon. He's broken. Inside, he's... inside, he's... Deacon, listen to me. Deacon, look, listen to me. Deacon, stop it, please. I'm not gonna listen to you anymore! I'm not listening to you or your A.A. crap anymore! Get out of my house! Deacon... Stop. Get out of my house! Deacon, I'm not going anywhere. Get out of my house! (Scarlett) Deacon, stop it. No. Fine. I'll go. Deacon, get back here. Deacon, stop it! (Grunting) (Scarlett) It's okay. It's okay. Come on. It's okay. (Deacon speaks indistinctly) (Crying) Come on. (Deacon growls) Aah! No, Deacon! No! No, Deacon, stop! You're gonna hurt him! Cut me loose! No, buddy. (Gunnar) Deacon! Deacon! Get off him! Deacon! (Deacon grunting) Okay, Deacon, now look. Look at what you're doing. Look at her. (Panting) (Sniffles) Go ahead. Take her home. I'm sorry. You sure? Get her out. Come on. (Crying) No, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna leave him. He's all right. He's all right. I'm sorry. You take care of him, please. (Crying) Come on. (Sobbing) Come on. (Continues sobbing) (Panting) I don't wanna talk. I don't wanna talk either. (Panting) But I'm not leaving here, Deacon. What's all this? Albert thinks the baseball stadium is still viable. Since when? He suggested we put a shopping mall in that site. I was only talking about alternatives. Oh. By the way, I'm moving Albert up in the organization, given that his vision is more in line with mine. You're demoting me? No, I'm just promoting him above you. Don't bother. I quit. (Lamar scoffs) Come on, Tandy. What... what are you talking about? Oh, it's none of your business. I'm just your daughter now, and apparently you can only stay on good terms with one of them at a time. Let me guess. You found out more nasty details about my mom. To be honest, no. But the crime scene techs found a camera's SD card in the garbage disposal at her place. Can't pull any data off the card, but it seems like a pretty deliberate act. Any idea what might have been on it? No. Well, it's yours if you want it. We're done processing the crime scene, so you can take back the apartment. I'll call if anything else comes up. Thank you. (Emily) Oh, my God. You got a letter... from your mom. (Papers rustle) (Gasps) She was protecting me. What? (Voice breaking) "I'm so sorry, baby. Let me take all the blame, all the scandal, all the ugliness away from you." "You deserve to be clean. You deserve to be free." She did it on purpose... (Whispers) to save me. Rayna, it's Cole. He's here. He's out. No, I'm gonna stick around. And I'll be here when he, uh, when he comes to. No, no, no, no, no. You stay right there. Yeah, it's, uh... it's bad. All right, we'll talk later. (Inhales sharply) (Groans) Morning, sunshine. Is it? What? Morning. Nope. (Groans) Oh, God. Well, that's a good first call. You might need him. (Exhales) Oh, my God. There's a whole lot of people worried about you, buddy. (Exhales) Look, I talked to Rayna. She told me what happened. I'm not ready to talk about that yet. I understand. I would like to go to a meeting. Yeah? (Whispers) Yeah. Just gonna grab a quick shower, get some coffee. No, I'll take care of that. Well, you can get the coffee, but you don't gotta babysit me anymore. You sure about that? Look, I get what I've done here, Cole. Believe me. 13 years of sobriety just... all I can do is go get my new welcome chip at the 8:00, right? You'll be there? Yeah. Wouldn't miss it. Thanks. I know you're mad. I am mad. I know. (Whispers) I'm sorry. (Normal voice) But I don't want you to be mad at me forever. 'Cause we need each other. I married your dad 'cause I loved him. But I also married him 'cause I wanted you to have a father who loved you as much as I do. And I love you more than anybody in the world. And I'm never, ever gonna leave you. (Crying) (Inhales sharply) (Continues crying) (Water drains) (Inhales and exhales deeply) (Exhales deeply) (Pills rattle) (Cap clicks) (Sighs) (Pills rattle) (Exhales deeply) (Cell phone rings) (Ring) (Sighs) I am so sorry, sweetheart. I should have been there for you. I'm sorry. No. It's my fault. I... pushed you away, and I shouldn't have. No. Anyway, I'm having a little memorial service at the Bluebird tonight. It would mean a lot if you came. Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there. Thank you. (Exhales) Thanks for meeting me. So I don't know why, but it's happening again. U.S. attorney is looking at the Vumberland deal. I know. I met with them. (Sighs) Did you do it because you're angry with me? They approached me. They offered immunity. Right. And, uh, what did you tell them? Nothing. Nothing? Why wouldn't you cut a deal to save yourself? I'm pregnant. What? Tandy Hampton? Dashell Brinks, U.S. Attorney's office. We would, uh, very much like to have a conversation with you about your father. (Juliette) I know you all probably know that, uh, my mama passed away recently, and, uh, she wasn't perfect. In fact, she was kind of a mess. But, um, she was my mess. (Inhales deeply) And, uh, she was my mom, and I loved her anyway, and she loved me. But her biggest dream was to see me sing at the Bluebird. So I hope you're here tonight, mama, and this one's for you. ♪
