 Previously, on "Chasing Life"... 
 April, you have cancer. 
 I'm not gonna die. 
 What did you wanna tell me? 
 Oh, um... 
 You deserve to meet someone. 
 You're Leo Hendrie. 
 You're one of my dad's new interns? 
 Can I call you "mom"? 
 You're not grounded. 
 Really? 
 But I want you to get a job. 
 There's a heart in here, you know? 
 It may be covered in a Nietzsche quote, but it's in there. 
 Who's Natalie Ortiz? 
 I don't know. Who is she? 
 Some girl who's car you took a picture of. 
 Why? 
 You really should stop distracting me at work. 
 Please, I'm inspiring you. 
 (Needle scratching on record) 
 (Sighs) 
 I should really turn that over. 
 Are you talking about the record or are you talking dirty to me? 
 A little of both. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Is Graham gonna walk in? 
 No no no. He's at a coffee tasting. 
 Of course he is. 
 I hope it's really good coffee. 
 Mm. 
 Come on. Let's go to my room. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Exhales) 
 Dominic : So Tori Amos or Enya? 
 I'm kidding. 
 What's the matter? 
 I'm just not... feeling well all of a sudden. 
 Oh, no. What's wrong? 
 Nothing. I just think maybe the chicken at that place wasn't cooked or something. 
 Let me get you some water. 
 I think I'm just gonna go home and sleep at my own place tonight. 
 Dominic : Are you sure? 
 I'll be fine. 
 ♪ You bet your soul, honey ♪ 
♪ you bet your soul ♪ 
♪ just right ♪ 
♪ you could stay all night and never wanna go home ♪ 
♪ 'cause we can't stop ♪ 
♪ won't stop. ♪ 
 Well, there are worse forms of bleeding that can ruin a date. 
 Have a lovely day. 
 Do you need to call George about this? 
 No, I mean, he said this could happen. It's a common symptom. 
 So how'd Dominic react? 
 I just let him think I had food poisoning. 
 Because going all "bridesmaids" all over his apartment is more attractive? 
 Well, you know, maybe it's better that this happened. 
 It would have been really messed up for me to have s*x with a guy before I tell him that I'm sick. 
 Why? 
 I mean, it's like lying, right? 
 Yeah, but if you tell him you're sick first and he freaks out, you might never have s*x with him. 
 And that just seems wrong. 
 I know. 
 So when do I tell him? 
 Before or after s*x? 
 During. 
 (Both chuckle) 
 Seriously, when? 
 I mean, he just made it so clear that he loves how drama free I am, and he's the first guy that I've actually been excited about in a really long time. 
 I kind of want to enjoy it a little longer before I put it all on the line. 
 Is that selfish? 
 There's no such thing as selfish for you now. 
 You have cancer. You get to do whatever you want. 
 Embrace it. 
 Stan :  April? 
 Oh, hi, Stan. 
 The one who got away. 
 I hope you mean professionally. 
 So, how's the morning going? 
 Busy. Kevin called in sick. 
 Sick? Or hung over? 
 Oh, sick for sure. 
 There was phlegm. 
 Huh. You're way too easy of a manager, unlike April here. 
 She really knew how to crack that whip. 
 Professionally. 
 Beth, gather the troops. 
 I have an important announcement to make. 
 It's gonna change the lives of everyone here at the Diesel Cafe. 
 Foam art. 
 Sometimes, when I work here I wonder if I'm dreaming. 
 (Elevator dings) 
 Dana : Hold that, please. There's someone in here, but let's just take this one if that's okay with you, Mr. Hendrie. I'm so glad we were able to get a meeting with Lawrence this quickly. This is really gonna help the campaign, Mr. Hendrie. I told you, call me Bruce. Right. So sorry. Thank you, Bruce. Leo :  The question is, does he know your first name? I'm betting that he doesn't. Correct me if I'm wrong, Bruce. You still taking the boat out tomorrow, Leo? Assuming that your staff remembered to put gas in it this time. Don't want to have to call the coast guard when I'm halfway to the vineyard again. (Elevator dings) Stephen : I've made inexcusable and unforgiveable mistakes against my wife... Danny, what's going on? Governor Vonn got caught with his pants down. A staffer in his office revealed some fairly explicit texts from the Governor. I'm not surprised. He's such a womanizing sleaze. Is the staffer talking? Actually,  he  is with his family in Baltimore asking press to respect  his  privacy. Okay, now I'm surprised. Wow. Oh, I bet that's what Bruce Hendrie was doing here. Whoa, Hendrie was here? Yeah, I saw him in the elevator with his obnoxious son Leo. They're meeting with Lawrence. And I'm sure Raquel. God, she is so fine. That was supposed to be me. Yeah, it sucks. I mean you'd have had a huge story. Yeah, thanks, Danny. I know. April, do not turn around. I told you not to turn around. Danny Gupta. Paul Peters. Hey, did you happen to read my last column? Actually, I have a policy of not reading any columns called "What the heck?" So, no. Well, I really think you would have found it interesting. It was about how traces of rat feces are often found on the tops of soda cans, but I'm sure you rinsed that off. I need a 500-word piece for my "Health and wellness" blog. Um, no thanks. I know that's only two words, but print it 250 times, done. You haven't even heard the pitch yet. I've got a local farmer's market vendor who claims that his carrot juice treats cancer symptoms, and can keep the disease from spreading. Swears it's worked on dozens of patients already. I don't do soft news. You know you're a floater, right? Shouldn't you be kissing my ass? (Chuckles) I make it a point, Paul,  to know the right asses to kiss. I don't have an assignment right now. I mean... I could take it. Really? Really? Yeah. Sure. "What the heck?" Do you think anyone actually went to that assembly? Seriously. What kind of a school makes an assembly optional? Especially an a cappella assembly. It's like asking if anyone wants to volunteer to drown themselves. (Clattering) What was that? Mom? (Gasps) I didn't know you were here. Brenna, why are you home so early? We had an assembly. It was optional. And we're pro-choice. Were you taking a nap or something? We can just go upstairs. Hon, can you give us a second? Us? Please, honey, just give us... Oh my God. Sweetie, remember Ben? No, "remember" is the wrong word. You haven't actually met. This is Ben. You might recognize him from his profile. He's not a complete stranger. Sara, I don't think we can really make this any less awkward. Dr. Carver, your blouse is kind of open. (Gasps) Oh my gosh. Oh, Brenna. (Groans) (Chuckles) Gerald : There you go. See you next time. (Sighs) Hi there. Hi. Can I offer you a sample? Sure, thanks. Yeah. I'm a reporter at the "Boston Post." Oh. April Carver. Oh. I'm writing an article for our blog about your juice. Gerald Rayburn. It's nice to know that I'm newsworthy. Thank you. Do you mind if I record a few questions? Oh, not at all. Thank you. So how long have you been in business? Oh, lets see, that would be about two years now. I was looking for alternative ways to help my health, and I happened upon this concoction soon after I was diagnosed. Oh, you have cancer? Mantle cell lymphoma. I'm so sorry to hear that. You look great though. Are you in remission? No. (Chuckles) Uh, we tried chemo a couple times, but that just made me feel worse. So now I am just living with cancer. Oh, God. If that sounds depressing, let me just tell you that you never truly live until you know you're gonna die. And you credit the carrot juice for keeping you alive? Oh, no, God. I mean, it's good, but it's not that good. (Chuckles) It helped though, I think. Has it helped with any of your symptoms? Well, here. Why don't you just read all about it? You know, why don't I just take a few bottles just for research. Done deal. Mom, she'll get over it. I promise. I know, but I want Brenna to feel safe in her own home. And now... She does feel safe. Now you're just overreacting. Is she? You never can tell with this guy. Mom, Ben is not a criminal. He works in finance. White collar crime is still a crime, dear. Brenna, I just want to say... Please, don't say anything. Can we just pretend like it never happened? That's not a healthy way for us to process this. And the last thing I want is for you to be traumatized by what happened today. I'm not traumatized. Why do you always have to use these extreme therapy words for everything? I just think we all have to get used to the idea that Ben could be spending a lot more time around here. And you know what? There's really only one way to deal with it. Kill him? You should all meet him, officially,  for dinner tomorrow night. Um... Are tops optional? (Chucking) I had my shirt on! April, hey. You got a sec? Hey, Mallory. How you doing? Oh, I'm exhausted. I'm dating this guy who's super into tantric s*x, and I'm just like "get off me. I have to go to bed," you know? Can I help you with something? Yes. So, in light of the governor's s*x scandal, I'm working on this article. It's sort of a "s*x in the office" kind of piece. And I'm quizzing people around here. Where is the wildest place you've ever had s*x? (Chuckles) This is totally anonymous. So let it rip. In a dorm room. (Laughs) Oh. I should get back to work. No no no no, wait. Just a couple questions. Number of sexual partners. What are we talking, single digits, double digits, triple? three. Hundred? No, three guys. Just guys? I've been with five women. Last question. Ever engage in an inter-office romance? No. Hmm. Smart. I got totally screwed over by Dominic  at the holiday party last year. Um, Dominic? Like arts and entertainment Dominic? Yeah. He is the worst. Dominic sleeps with everyone. It's a good thing you haven't gotten sucked in yet. (Chuckles) Or I guess he hasn't gotten sucked in yet. You know, because... No, I get it. I get it. Beth:  Hello? He's a player, Beth. Beth :  Who? Dominic. Did something happen? April : I found out he sleeps around. So I did a little digging... This guy's life is like a beer commercial. Yeah, we've stalked him online before. Yeah, but we never cross-referenced Instagram, Twitter, and Vine before. Three weeks ago Courtney commented  that she was "still tired from last night." Dot dot dot.  And a month before that... (Chuckles) Some girl named Sarah Sophie tagged him backstage at that Phoenix show. It's like everywhere he goes, he just trips and falls on some girl with bangs. Well, have you seen Dominic lately? April : What do you mean? This is what happens when you date people who look like that. Other people want them. April :  Yeah, well... Apparently he wants them too. And I'm trying to take care of myself here. I can't be stressing out looking at pictures of him and Chloe at her beach house. They hiked in the dunes. They both got poison IV. I don't know. I just don't see this going anywhere. You haven't even had s*x with him. I know. That part sucks. Beth : Well, you still could. What? You've been stressing about when to tell him you're sick and how you're gonna do it, so if you really don't see this going anywhere, you don't have to worry about anything but having fun with him. This is liberating. Okay. I gotta go make art out of hot milk now. Ew. Love you. April :  Love you too. Sorry that took so long. The sugar packet guy was being really unreasonable. You'd think he'd be nicer. I mean, right? Sugar. How are we doing here? So... Most of the shops in town are going to be doing leaves or a heart. I think we could be more imaginative. Here at Diesel, we're going to be doing the wavy heart. Kieran : Could be worse. Could it? What could be worse than seeing your mom get groped by some guy in pleated khakis? At least his khakis were on. Thanks. Now I just pictured them off. I walked in on my parents once. Actually having s*x? Well, s*x adjacent. Let's just say his head was in her lap. And you can stop right there. Thanksgivings were never the same. (Chuckles) Well, at least they were both your parents, not your mom and some random. Well, what about your dad? Is he dating someone too or... ? No. Actually, my dad died. Sorry. I just assumed your parents were divorced or something, 'cause everyone's parents are. No, it's okay. He died in a car accident a couple of years ago. Anyway, this dinner tonight should be super awkward. Well, let me know if it gets really unbearable and you need to escape. I'll come break you out. I'll create a diversion, pretend like I'm stealing the family jewels or something... (Chuckles) while you sneak out the back. Family jewels? I don't know. I don't know. You live in Beacon Hill. But seriously, if you feel like you need some moral support, I'm down to be your plus one. So how many repeat customers would you say you have in a week? I would say that is the lifeblood of my business. Um, I don't have many customers, but the ones I do have keep coming back. You did. It's just because I'm writing a story about you. Oh, you also like the juice. I can tell. You're more focused today. I am? Would you just play along and say you are? (Chuckles) That would make me feel like I'm actually helping people with this stuff, which would help me forgive the cancer. How do you forgive cancer? Well, cancer led me to the juice,  and if the juice is helping people, then it gives me some reason as to why  all of this is happening to me. Trying to make sense of why this is happening to you is one of the hardest things... It sounds like. Yeah. It helps that there are customers to talk about it to. There's Rita with breast cancer,  Dennis with melanoma, Lewis with lymphoma. (Phone beeps) Um, April with leukemia. I didn't tell you earlier 'cause I'm not really used to... to saying it. How long since you've been diagnosed? About a week. I'm sorry, kid. Are you okay? How did your family react to the news? I haven't told them yet.  That's okay. Don't feel any shame about who you tell and when. I just feel like I'm lying to them, you know? No, you have to have the time to get your own head around it, but don't deny yourself a support system. Have you thought about going to a support group? I'm not really the support-group type, but I told my best friend and she's supportive. Does she have cancer? It doesn't count. You gotta be around people who understand the language you're speaking... Like me. The best advice that I can give you: Surround yourself with people who can handle it, because it's a lot to handle. My last round of chemo, I almost didn't make it. My body went into septic shock. The doctors called in my wife, my kids. I was prepared... to die. Now obviously I turned a corner, but my wife Doris was... she was there every step of the way. I... I wouldn't have made it without her. Arianna : I can tell she's judging me. I mean, she thinks she's superior to me and wants me to know that no matter what I do she'll never respect me. Okay. Well, let's take a step back and examine why you give your assistant so much power over your emotions. I don't give her the power. She has it every day of her life. She's 22 years old with a D-cup. She rules the world. (Scoffs) And we should figure out why you make everything about age. 'Cause I'm a 50-year-old woman about to enter the dating scene again. I'm screwed. So this is about your divorce. Arianna, believe me, I understand where you're coming from. But I promise you it's not that dire when you put yourself out there. There are wonderful men for women of every age. Have you considered signing up for an online dating site? (Groans) That's the last thing I need... to see Ben's picture up there soliciting s*x from every woman in Boston. I thought you said your husband's name was Brian. No, Brian was my first husband. Ben's the man who left me six months ago. Sorry, right. I... Right. What did you say Ben does for a living? I feel like I should have it in my notes. It might be relevant. He works in finance. Oh. And women love that. My son told me Ben has been on three dates already with the same woman. Apparently he took her to some flamenco performance. (Beeps, whirs down) (Sighs) I hate you. Copier's jammed. You're gonna have to wait a minute. You're always making me wait. Oh, hi. So where's the paper stuck? I don't know. Let me take a look. It might be in between... Oh, yeah. (Mutters) Let me see over there. Where do you see... Why don't you come talk to me in the supply room? Its door locks. Sounds like you've done that before. What? Paul :  Excuse me? Uh, Paul, hi. The copier's jammed. Let me take a look. I'm gonna try the one in classifieds. Okay, we'll talk later. Mom, what happened? You said you were gonna be home an hour ago. Don't get me started. It's too late. I'm started. Pearl brought a new friend as her bridge partner, claiming she was her roommate on their last elder hostel trip. She was a ringer. A life master. I'm out 200 bucks. I could just... Um, mom, I thought we agreed you weren't gonna bet real money. I should wash up for dinner. Wait, I need your help. I'm having a crisis. Technically, I should only discuss this with a colleague. Okay. I just found out my new patient is about to get a divorce from Ben, who's gonna be here in 15 minutes. So stop seeing your patient. No, I would never put my personal life before a patient. So stop seeing your psycho. I don't want to. I like him. And even though it's kind of early, I think we both kind of feel like there's this potential for this to be something. How sure are you? We just started dating. (Doorbell rings) I got it. It's for me. Emma : Decide after dinner. Either she goes or he goes. And at the end of the night, only one of them will receive a rose. What? That's right. You don't watch reality TV. You read. Brenna :  Hey, mom? Can my friend Kieran  join us for dinner? Sure. Anyone else want anything while I'm up? No, I'm good. No, thank you. So, April, you taking part in the whole juicing fad? This? Yes, I am. I worship at the altar of Gwyneth Paltrow. (Chuckles) Since when? Sara : So you know about juicing? Does that mean health is a top priority for you in life? What are some of your other priorities, if you had to say? Uh... well, I guess you could say health and fitness. I started pilates a few weeks ago. I'm the only man in my class. I would love to try pilates. Maybe you'll take me with you sometime. Okay, but you might break up with me when you see how inflexible I am, literally. (Laughs) I don't think I've ever met a man that does pilates. You said you worked in finance, Ben? Yes. Brenna :  We work in a tattoo parlor. As you can tell. Yeah, it's pretty fresh. (Mouths) This one means anarchy. Actually, that's just a star. And what is that one on your chest? It's a math formula, it's in reference to the... Kieran doesn't believe in college. He thinks it's a waste of money. Uh, that's not it. Personally I believe that I should create my own... So, Ben, my mom told me your son goes to Stanford? Ben:  Yeah. That's like crazy expensive, right? It's a really good school, though. This chicken's really good, mom. Yeah, yeah. Anytime I can get chicken these days it's a real treat. My ex-wife was allergic. Oh, you're divorced? What happened? (Ben chuckles) Uh, well, that's kind of complicated. Ben, you don't have to answer that. But do you think you'll ever remarry? I mean, in the future, hypothetically? Uh, um... I'm not sure. Mom, why don't you come help me with dessert? Oh, excuse me. (Whispering) What are you doing? What? Am I being too intense? Okay, so you're aware you're doing it. Why are you acting like this? I'm just trying to get a sense of where this relationship is going. You guys just started dating. Why are you doing this now? I have my reasons. Well, whatever they are, you are being way too intense. Just chill out. This is supposed to be the fun part. Okay. 
 
  (April sighs) Sara :  Who's that? Just this guy from work. Oh, he's cute. Are you dating? Yeah. I don't know. (Sighs) I have to go. Well, I... I have to change. First I've got to change. (Sighs) I feel crazy! You sound crazy. April : It's not like me to get so jealous. I want to beat those girls. I want to win. Oh my God. Listen to me. What is wrong with me? Nothing. I'm kind of loving you like this, actually. Just remember if Dominic's a player, you get to play right back. Totally. Yeah. How do I do that? Beth :  Be detached. You don't care that much. You don't get jealous. You just get whatever you want and then you move on. Okay. Done. So what do I wear? Think about what you'd normally wear on a date. Got it. Now wear the opposite. (Crowd chattering) Yeah, see you later. You made it. Yeah, sorry I'm late. No, it's cool. I just finished the interview. What do you want to do? I didn't plan anything. I didn't think you were coming. Really? Why not? Earlier, you seemed a little... I don't know. Off. Dom. What are we doing later? We can just go home. April : I know, right? He just looks too hot tonight. But he is going home... with me. You can have him another night. Let's get out of here. Oh, no. Just leave these. I'll just take those. I'll get these tomorrow. Uh... You know, I should probably get going. Oh, okay. Well... Before you go, then let me just say I'm sorry if tonight was a little strange for you. Maybe you didn't notice, but in case you did. Uh... I know. It's okay. I was probably a little intense. Ahh. Sara... I'm gonna be honest. This was just a lot all at once. I wouldn't be surprised if you ran screaming from the house after this. I do have to go, but I am not running and screaming. Great. All right, that's great. So we're on the same page. We like each other and we're just gonna continue to see where this goes with no pressure... Unless asking you to agree to that counts as pressure, in which case you do not have to answer. Thanks for dinner. Anytime. Or anytime, you know, after you're ready. No rush. Brenna :  Did you see the look on Ben's face  when he was trying to act like he liked your tattoos? That was hilarious. What word did he use to describe it again? I don't know. It was like "funky" or something super lame. Oh my God. When I told him where you used to have a piercing... I'm gonna take off. Wait, really? Yeah. I'll see you at work. What just happened? I came here tonight to dinner just to be there for you, not so that you can use me to piss off your family. Kieran, that's not why... You know... If it was my mom and she was out there, alone, trying to meet someone... You know, whatever. Forget it. I think we're just different. Want a glass of wine or something? Okay. Hang on a second. Let's go to your room. April, can we just talk? I thought I was the girl here. Mm. Wait. April. What's going on with you? What, whenever you want to hook up I'm supposed to just go for it, but when I do, you say "no"? Considering your dating history, I'm getting some mixed signals here. My dating history? What's that supposed to mean? It's fine. It's cool. I heard all about you. I get what you're looking for, and I'm cool with that. Have I treated you badly? What?  No, really, April. Have I lied to you? Have I done anything to disrespect you? Or does that not even matter to you? I'm just... I'm looking for something more real in my life right now. Well, I'm looking for someone that doesn't treat me like this. So maybe this is just not what either of us is looking for. (Door opens) Guess who just waited for Arcade Fire tickets for three hours, and almost had to punch a priest  to get the last ticket? It's like "I'm sorry dude. I don't care if you're a man of the cloth, cutting in line is not what Jesus would do." You guys in the middle of something or... ? No. No, April was just on her way out. (Door opens) (Fist thuds) So... I think I dodged a bullet. I mean, if this is how Dominic handles a strong woman, no wonder he hasn't had a real relationship in years. Wait, you said he got offended when you tried to make it all about s*x, 'cause that doesn't actually sound like a player. Well, whatever. It doesn't... It doesn't even matter now. It's over, and I'm totally okay with that. I definitely don't need any more stress in my life. Everything's different now. Yeah, except you. You're doing the same thing you always do. What am I doing? Uh, this. You look for reasons not to be with guys. It's called having high standards. No, it's not. From what you're telling me now, it sounds like he actually really likes you, and you're just talking yourself out of it. He's slept with like... Slept. Past tense. He's a hot guy, okay? If I were that dude, I would be getting laid as much as possible until I found the one. But I'm not the one. How do you know that? Because I'm sick. So? You're gonna get better. What if I don't? Well then... All the more reason then to do something that you have never done... Take a real risk. Please. I take risks all the time. I crashed a blood drive last week... Yeah, you take risks at work, not in you're love life. You... God, you always find a reason to bail. You know I'm right, Ap. You're gonna talk to me about commitment issues? You can't even stay in a country for more than two years. You are one of the smartest people I know, yet you're totally avoiding trying to find a career that could actually go somewhere. Instead you'd rather sit here making chai lattes  and foam art and sleeping with your ex-boyfriends. You think that's taking real risks? Wow. I'm sorry, that was out of line. Yeah, it was. But that doesn't mean you're wrong. Hey, Stan? You ready to close up? Yeah. Permanently. I quit. Uh, Beth, what are you doing? I've been working here for too long. I'm using it as a crutch. And you know what? I'm gonna take a risk and try something more challenging. So as much as it pains my wavy heart to say it, it's time. April : Beth, you'll be unemployed. You'll have no income. And I also won't have any regrets. I dare you to do the same. Sara : And I wanted to start by saying I've really enjoyed getting to know you over these last few sessions. It's always exciting taking on new patients, you know, and... I thought that I had more time in my schedule to commit to someone new every week. And I just... I'm realizing... (Laughs) Wait, wait. Dr. Carver, you're not breaking up with me. (Chuckles) I just don't think I'm gonna be able to give you the kind of attention you need right now, with everything you're going through... with the divorce, and... Well, we'll see about that. After last night. Last night? Ben slept over. Oh. I guess things didn't work out with the woman he was seeing. (Chuckles) That's too bad for him. Yeah, but it's great for me, you know? I mean, I feel like finally he's appreciating what he had, right? I mean, better late than never, you know. Right. (Rock music playing) ♪ I've got this second chance... ♪ Hey. Hey. Thomas Carver. Any relation? My dad. He was a writer. I know it's not Kierkegaard, but... Why are you giving this to me? I feel really bad about last night. I swear I didn't invite you over to use you or anything. It's just... He's the first guy that she's brought home since... Maybe you're completely over my family now. But if you're not, feel free to read that. It was my dad's last novel. I'll check it out. Sorry, I... Freaked out on you. Yeah, you kind of did. I had no idea you were that... Like... "That like" what? I don't know, sensitive? You know, when you get tattoos, it doesn't burn away your feelings. (Chuckles) You're right, though. I'm not usually that sensitive. I guess I was just... confused. Confused about what? Just... Whether you liked me or not. I do like you. I know, but I mean... Wait, you mean like... I'm sorry, now I'm confused. ♪ Oh, I've got this second chance ♪ 
♪ I'm gonna take it. ♪ 
♪ I've got this song and dance... ♪ Still confused? No. Gerald : So, now I am just learning to live with cancer. Oh, God, if that sounds depressing, let me just tell you that you never truly live until you know you're gonna die. Um, excuse me? Why is Gerald's booth closed? Oh, it's so sad. He passed away late last night. You know, he was sick... cancer. I guess he had a tumor around his heart and it grew fast and unexpectedly. He had a heart attack. His poor wife... I have no idea what she's going to do. (April crying) Oh my God, what happened? I'm sorry. I should have called first. No no no. Come in. A friend died today. Oh, April. I mean, it was just this guy I met writing a piece. (Sighs) I had just started getting to know him, but you know when you meet someone and you just connect with them on like... It's like they get you on like another level. (Sniffles) I had that with him. He was a really good man. Why him? He wanted to help people. Why did he have to die? You can't try to make sense of these things. He had a family and a job he cared about so much. He didn't deserve this. It's not fair. (Sighs) I know. I know. Hey... It's not fair you lost your dad. Sometimes the best people just aren't the ones that get to stick around. That doesn't mean that they're not the best people. Are you okay? I'm so sorry about everything. It's okay. (Sighs) Hey. Hi. Mmm. So, last night... (Sighs) It was great. Yeah. Now get out. What?! I have another girl coming over. Can you hurry up and leave so I can make the bed? Oh my God. Sorry, I had to. (Chuckles) I totally deserve it, huh? I feel like such an idiot. I know I've been acting so weird these past couple days. That was some serious crazy-girl behavior. It's so not like me. I'm taking it as a compliment. You should. Must mean I really like you or something. Now let's just keep being honest with each other. Okay? 'Cause if you'd just told me that you were jealous of those other girls or you were worried that I saw this as casual, or something, I would have said you got nothing to worry about. It all feels really different with you. It does. Yeah. (Sighs) You're like the first person I've ever dated that I can actually see a future with.  April? On deadline. For the blog? You're gonna want to hear some real news. Governor Vonn's staff are applying for other jobs. Wait, Vonn's stepping down? Looks that way, which means Hendrie has an actual shot at the election. Uh, I'll get into it after this. Have this proofed by 5:00. Uh, hey, Paul? Just give me five minutes for my article. What article? I thought your guy died. What? Carrot dude died? Just let me email it to you. There's still a story here. I got your headline, April... "Carrot dude: shredded." Can you not be a jackass for one second, Danny? Whoa, sorry. Is your mom a carrot or something? April : "In the end it doesn't matter that Gerald's carrot juice couldn't save him or the world. The legacy of 'the carrot dude' was never about whether or not he could cure cancer. It was about the community he created with other people who were struggling. With his support, he helped a lot of people feel a little less alone... Rita with breast cancer, Dennis with melanoma, Lewis with lymphoma... To name a few."
