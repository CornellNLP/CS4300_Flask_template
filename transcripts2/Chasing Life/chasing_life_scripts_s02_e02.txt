 Previously on Chasing Life Will you marry me? 
 Yes. 
 I think you're still in love with April. 
 She's getting married. 
 You should have said "No, I'm not in love with her." 
 That's not what I meant. 
 The chemo didn't do what we needed it to do. 
 April, you're not in remission. 
 What if a clinical trial doesn't work? 
 You heard Hamburg, I can't get a bone marrow transplant until I'm in remission. 
 "This is the story of how I lived my life, and planned my death." 
 I read these obits, and you know what I realized? 
 For most of us, what we do for a living is gonna be, like, one line in it. 
 I don't wanna die, and I don't wanna stop living my life. 
 I just need to start living it differently. 
 April : We gotta get to the courthouse or we're gonna be waiting in line for hours! 
 You couldn't have had breakfast before you came over? 
 Woman, I will eat my cereal when I want to! 
 Sorry, I'm just practicing my husband voice. 
 Hm. Well, keep practicing it, and you're not gonna need one. 
 Bossy. Mm. Just like a Hendrie woman. 
 Ah, Carver woman. That's not changing. 
 April Carver Hendrie? 
 April Lauren Carver. 
 Okay, okay. 
 You have your birth certificate? 
 The one that you texted me about six times? 
 Just practicing my wife voice. 
 Touche. 
 And 50 bucks? 
 I have a credit card. 
 Well, do they take cards? 
 Checking. 
 Okay, well, walk and search. Let's go Oh, wait. April. 
 Come on. Tell me in the cab. 
 No, no, no... did you see this? 
 Let's go, let's go. 
 It says we have to get married within 60 days. 
 Oh, well... whatever. That's fine. 
 But what about your clinical trial? Do you know which one you're doing? 
 No, not yet. I'm seeing Hamburg today. 
 Well, what if you have to go back to the hospital? 
 That would kinda get in the way of a wedding. 
 Then let's just go to city hall after we get our license. 
 Well, hey, that's fine with me, but you're the one who said you wanted to have the whole wedding experience. 
 I guess I should just wait and see which one I get into. 
 Okay. 
 So much for living in the moment.

 Dr. Hamburg : April, you really need to start your clinical trial now. 
 I know. I started looking online and there are a million options. 
 And for each one there are people saying it's a miracle and then there are these horror stories. 
 Look, I hear you. But the longer you wait... 
 I know, but I just need a couple of days before I jump back into treatment. 
 Will a couple of days matter that much? 
 As long as it's really gonna be a couple of days. 
 But you need to pick a clinical trial so we can get you on the list. 
 I recommend the Selkin trial. 
 It's a later-phase trial, so it's been tested a decent amount. 
 Not a lot of side effects. Outpatient. 
 Okay. I'm in. 
 I had a feeling you might be. 
 So I started the process of filing your application. 
 Can I tell them you'll start Monday? 
 Okay. 
 (Mellow rock plays)

 Hi, mom. 
 What's wrong? 
 I just said, "Hi, mom." 
 I know, but you only play that... that hippie, flower child crap when you're trying to calm down about something. 
 Not true. I'm fine. How are you? 
 Did you and Sam have fun at the movies? 
 Yeah, we saw a foreign film. 
 Oh, the one from Iran about the little girl who couldn't find her dad and they had to sell the family goat... 
 That was boring as hell. We watched  Guardians of the Galaxy. 
 And that's a foreign film? 
 Well, it doesn't take place here. 
 (Chuckles) Well, are you gonna tell me what's wrong? 
 It's just... money. 
 With April not working, and all these medical expenses, and Charton just raised their tuition again. 
 It already costs as much as a private college. 
 We just can't keep bleeding money like this. 
 If you were smart, you'd just push me down the stairs. 
 I have a killer life insurance policy. Literally. 
 Mom, seriously. 
 Something's gotta go, or we'll end up with nothing. 
 And I'm thinking it's gonna be Charton. 
 I mean, the whole reason I sent Brenna to that school in the first place was to keep her out of trouble and get her on the path towards college. 
 And she's doing fine and she doesn't even want to go to college. 
 Even though we've set aside that whole college fund, which is another potential waste of money. 
 And that toilet upstairs is making weird noises. 
 Which is probably gonna cost a ton of money to repair. 
 I know, it's hard. That's why I'm so glad that dad always handled our money. 
 Well, it's not like I cost that much. 
 (Laughs) This from the girl who begged her parents to bankroll a trip to Spain so that she could drive around in a mini-bus with her boyfriend. 
 Simpler times. 
 No. They weren't that much simpler. 
 You just don't remember because you were too stoned. 
 I did not think you were serious the other night about ending things. 
 I mean, you were pretty drunk. 
 I was drunk. 
 But I meant what I said. That's kind of how drinking works. 
 I thought we liked each other. 
 Yeah. As what, though? 
 Are you telling me you think there's a real future? 
 Right. That's kind of my problem. 
 I was just taking it day by day. 
 Me too. But that's not enough for me anymore. 
 Taking things day by day made me realize that I want someone who wants more than day by day. 
 With me. 
 It's... it's complicated. 
 Mm. Not for me. 
 Okay. 
 Woman on iPad : I saw you flirting with him. 
 I <bleep>. We've been married ten years. Let me guess. Real Housewives again? What else? - There's something about watching that show alone that makes you realize just how boring it is. She's not alone. Oh, hey, Vanessa. I didn't know you guys knew each other. Oh, yeah. Meg's my drinking buddy. (Chuckles) Hm... So did you start your clinical trial? No, I just got into the Selkin trial. So I start in a couple days. What made you choose that one? I didn't. Hamburg did. Oh. So you're just letting Hamburg take the driver's seat here? Yeah, isn't that kind of her job? I used to think that, and then I got into a couple of bad clinical trials that my doctor recommended and I realized, this is my life. Not theirs. - Yeah. Hamburg's not the one who's gonna die if she's wrong about this. (Sighs) I'm just saying, it's up to you how you wanna steer this. Okay, so I do all of this research, and then what? Trust your gut. I'm not so good at that. My brain's usually buzzing too loud for me to hear it. I usually make my best decisions when I turn my brain off for a few days. Do your research and then just distract yourself. Go on a bender or whatever. (Meg chuckles) Check out. Silence the mind to hear the heart. That was very zen, Meg. I have a Japanese stepmother. Oh. (Meg chuckles) (April chuckles weakly) So we want to make a short film that's like a sexy, comedic take... Redundant. s*x is always comedic. It's a parody of a classic French farce set in an American high school. It deals with the theme of how fluid modern sexuality is. So Ford would play a girl who is trying to decide between two guys, meanwhile they're hiding their love for each other. Art imitates life. In your dreams. Dude, homophobic much? Dude, you know I have two moms. Margo : This sounds like a really cool idea, you guys. Let me know how I can help. I love a good farce. I already watched all the ones you recommended. And didn't need the subtitles 'cause I speak fluent French. Margo : When you guys are finished, I think you should definitely submit to the New England private school film festival. Dude, no. I don't need kids from other schools watching us make out. Dude, yes. And then you can put LGBTQ activism on your college application. Brown would love that. So would Amherst. We're down. (Laughs) Good negotiating, Brenna. You'll have no trouble in Hollywood. Are you serious? Uh, what's the offer? Okay, and the back end? Amazing. Close it. Okay, thanks. I just sold my next book. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Wow! That's great. Sorry, was that insensitive? I know you're working on a book too. It's cool. I don't feel competitive with you or anything. Plus I don't really consider a book that comes with a free CD literature. Yeah, it's good that you're not competitive. Seriously, man, congrats. You, uh, doing anything to celebrate? I should, right? I mean, I just made more money than I've ever had in my life. You know what's way cooler than whatever you just made? - What? Twice whatever you just made. I'm serious, man. We should, like, go to the casino or something. You ever been to Spirit Lake? In Connecticut? No. Well, not to brag, but I have mad gambling skills. I paid for my first car through online poker, at 16. Isn't that illegal? Totally. But this isn't. And hey, what better way to get over your breakup than to be around a bunch of girls who just want to have fun, right? As long as you don't use the phrase "girls just wanna have fun" in front of any actual girls. Whatever, bro. It's worked before. (Knocking) Oh, my god! What's wrong? You never just show up without calling, and then calling a second time to confirm, and then updating your calendar if you're running late. I know, I'm just... I'm researching all of these trials and trying not to overthink anything right now. So I just wanted to be somewhere where I could just clear my head. April, did you just kill someone? No, but funny you should say that. I'm trying not to kill myself. I have to pick a clinical trial. And I just... I need to take a couple of days and not think about it. I just need to turn off my computer, my brain. Stop obsessing. And just live in the now. And have some fun while I still can. And then I'll come back to it. So... Do you wanna go to Bermuda? We never went. Like, now? Yes, I checked flights, and they are super cheap right now. And I bet you could use a vacation. I can't. I can't, I have this big conference call in two days. And it's kind of like my thing. I've been harassing these buyers from this huge department store in London to see Jaclyn’s new line, and they finally did, and, well, now they want to talk to both of us. That is so amazing. Don't worry about the trip. It was just an idea. They have phones in Bermuda, right? Really? Yeah. Screw it! Come on, let's get out of here! Let's go, like, immediately. Shh! I don't want Natalie to feel bad that we're not inviting her. Oh, she's not here. You're fine. Dominic's? Well, no. They broke up, actually. Really? What happened? Don't know. She's not talking about it. All I know is she's been at some diner down the block, spending her nights there just reading. I guess it's helping her get over it. Sorry, Natalie is spending her nights reading? Yeah, I know. She's full of surprises. Well, so are we, starting tomorrow at... 10:56 A.M. sounds like a good time to arrive on a tropical island. Why, yes, I think it is. (Laughs) Beth : Whoo! April : We made it! Oh, my god! Look at this view! April! Look at this place! Oh, my... (Gasps) Wow! Oh! Can we stay forever? Definitely. Yeah. (Laughs) (Gasps) This is fabulous! Ooh! don't mind if I do. I'm gonna make us some drinks, and then we'll go into town in like, 15? Uh, I should probably do a little work to prep for this call tomorrow. You know, just so I'm not stressing later. Beth, if there's anything I learned from taking work way too seriously, it's that you can totally BS a conference call. That's the beauty of it. 'Cause nobody can see you. Oh, no, I'm planning to take this call on the toilet. I just think I should prepare first. Well, don't you want to explore while it's still light out, though? I mean, we can go shopping for fun clothes! Did you see all those cute stores? Yeah, I didn't see any blazers in the windows, so I doubt you'll find anything. Vacation April doesn't wear blazers. And what does "vacation April" wear? I don't know. I've never been on a vacation. Actually, no, that's a lie. I went to Amsterdam spring break senior year. I was doing a report on the parliamentary democracy and... Not a vacation. I had a beer before we went to the Anne Frank house. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Please, just stop where you are. Yes! (Laughs) Cheers. (Giggles) Dude, hurry up with the shots! I'm coming, I'm coming! So what's your name? Lauren. What brings you down here, Lauren? Oh, the usual. (Cell phone rings) My friend and I trying to escape our lives. Oh, totally get that. My buddies and I work at Goldman. This is the first time we've had a break in, like, a month. Seems like your friend can relate. Hey, come hang out with us. We're celebrating my buddy Dave's bachelor party. There may be some unsavory guy talk, but... That's okay. I'm pretty hard to shock. Wanna give me a hand with these shots? Sure. Cool. I'll take this... I'll get that one. Sweet. Oh, hey, guys! Hey! (Cheering) Congratulations. I hear you're getting hitched. Yes, I am, thank you very much. Cheers to that. Cheers. Cheers. Mm. Ah! Oh... (Coughs) Yep. Oh. You're engaged. Huh? Oh. Yeah. I was... Hm. Oh, I was just enjoying talking to you. I wasn't like... Hey, it's none of my business, but that's kinda shady. No, I'm, like, the least shady person you will ever... Is this what Michelle's doing right now at her bachelorette? No! No, no. No. She wouldn't... Oh, man, if she's trying to hook up with some random... I'm not doing anything! I gotta call her. She's not. No... Hey, come on, man, we're having fun! (Sighs) I'm gonna... (Shower running) Hey. You got a sec? Yeah. Just one. I'm going into Cambridge to meet Ford for dinner. Hey, is it cool if we go to a concert after? It's this last-minute surprise show. It's folk music. Why did you say that? Uh, grandma said that you'd be more likely to let me go if I did. So it's not folk music? No, it is. April put a song by this girl on the playlist that she made me for my stem cell donation. Oh, that's sweet. Sure. As long as you're home by 11. I know. I got it. Thanks, mom. Actually, I wanted to check in on how things are going at school. What do you mean? Well, I just remember you talking a lot about how you didn't feel like you really fit in at Charton. And, I don't know, now with Greer gone, I guess I just was wondering if you've had any thoughts about maybe starting over somewhere new. You know, clean slate. Actually, I really like Charton now. You do? Yeah. I feel like I finally have a group there. And they have this really cool new film club. I'm gonna make a short film and submit it to this film festival. I'm really excited about it. Cool. Anyway, I should probably finish getting ready. Yeah. I'll see you at 11? No later. No later. (Electronic dance music plays) (Crowd chattering) Oh, hey. Hi. Do you mind if I... ? Mi marijuana es su marijuana. Yo, hold up. What? I don't want to get my ass kicked. What? Last time I smoked up a married chick her husband beat me up. Beth! (Music continues) Oh, you look cute, babe! April : That guy, Mr. Tennessee state, totally wants to do you. Just sayin'. Just sayin'. Oh, is this how "vacation April" talks? Yes, it is. (Both laugh) Oh, my god. Come on. Let's go get drinks. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Bartender. (Exhales) (Laughs) Thank you so much for coming with me. Of course. It feels so nice not have to be a sick person right now, and just get to be a normal girl on vacation with her best friend. It seriously means, like, everything to me. I love you, freak. I love you too. (Laughs) Now, let's make this a night to remember. Oh, that sounds sexual. Good. Now, drink it. Oh, boy. We'll pay for them, don't worry. Okay. Whoo! (Music continues) 
 
 You look thirsty. Took you long enough. You could have come over to me. Nah. I like a woman who knows what she wants. Who says I know what I want? Well, you know you want attention. I mean, you're wearing that to make sure you're literally the shiniest object in sight. Right? It's like you see inside my soul. Girl : Love it! Excuse me. May I? Plenty more where that came from. Thank you. You don't look like you need it, though. You seem pretty chill already. I don't think anybody's ever used that word to describe me. (Laughs) What can I say? I'm a poet. Huh...

Anyway, all I know is that if we were at a hip-hop show right now, they'd be way more a**l about checking IDs. Yeah, 'cause everyone here is over 40. Oh! Oh, my god! Ford, Brenna? Oh, my god!

What would you even get at a pawn shop? I swear to god I saw a crown in that window. Like for teeth? No. Like for your head. Like it belonged to some king. It could have been mine. Dominic : That's not a good use of my money. Danny : Unlike a country music concert in the middle of a racetrack? I love Faith Hill. You would. You're kinda country. Shut up! So, Dominic, wanna show me that record collection in your room? Yeah. Um, all the records are out here. Not in Dominic's room. - Actually, there's another record player in my room. I was just telling Layla all about my other records. Come on. (Dominic and Layla laughing) So, wanna see if we can find some beer? I'm good. Cool. Cool. Me too. So, where are you from? Um, right around Spirit Lake, actually. My family's lived there for years. Oh, yeah? Since back when it was a reservation? I'm Puerto Rican. Oh. That's too bad. I was hoping we could connect on the whole Indian-Indian thing. (Music plays faintly) Okay. That is clearly coming from computer speakers, and not a record player. I mean, you can just tell by the low bass frequency... Whoa. What was that for? It's better than letting you keep talking. Girl, I like your style. How do you not think that this music is emotional? Do you not have feelings? I do. Like when there's real problems. But, like, how big can your issues be? You're from Vermont. Uh, actually, her mother killed her father in self-defense when she was a baby. And then she went to prison, so... Whoa! Really? I didn't know that. I just made that up. Just go with it. So how long have you and Jesse been together? Uh, we're actually not together. People always think we are. Yeah, we're just each other's gay best friends, so... I didn't know that you were, um... Yeah. No, I mean, they don't make us wear signs or anything. They should. Then we wouldn't crotch-block each other all the time because people always assume we're together. Well, as the token straight girl here, I know what it feels like to be "the other" now. Oh, I didn't know you were... Yeah, they don't make us wear signs or anything. Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen, Fay Wolf. (Applause) You should totally hit that. For both of us. (April laughs) Well, thank you for walking me home. Of course. It's really dark, and your friend was... Otherwise engaged. (Laughs) Yeah, she was. Go, Beth. (Laughs) (Sighs) Thanks for walking me home. You just said that. Well, I meant it. It was very sweet of you. You didn't have to do that. Yes, I did. I have three sisters at home, and my mum raised me right. "Mum!" You just said "mum!" That's so cute! You're pretty cute. Oh, my god, stop. No. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I just... I thought... No, no, no. It's, um... You're not into me. That's fine. No, it's not you! I'm... I'm engaged. Really? Yes. You never said anything. I know, I'm sorry. I just wanted to escape for the night. Oh, my god, that sounds so horrible. I'm gonna... I gotta go to bed. Are you really engaged? Yes. There's a lot of things I didn't tell you. Good night. (Phone rings) Oh... (Groans) Hey, you. Hi. I, um... I just wanted to say that I miss you. Aw. I don't think I've heard you say you missed me before. That's what I get for picking an independent woman. I am independent. It's just... nice to feel like I'm yours sometimes. You know? (Door slams) I gotta go. There goes that independence again. Hey. What's wrong? I missed my call. Oh, my god! Your conference call. Right. The one I asked you to make sure I was on. Thanks for that. I'm so sorry. Obviously, I didn't do that on purpose. Right. You just weren't thinking about the consequences of anything. Living in the moment. God. Where's my phone? Okay, there it is. And it's dead. Great. I guess I can wait another three minutes till I get fired. You're not gonna get fired. How do you know? You don't even know Jaclyn. All right? This was really important. How am I even gonna explain this? If I tell the truth, I look totally irresponsible. But, I mean, I can't just pretend that my phone wasn't working for two hours. You're gonna think of something. You always do. I mean, it was kind of worth it, though. When's the last time we had that much fun? Really, April? If this was your job on the line, you would never have said that. I mean, work was always your priority at The Post. Always. And what, now that it's my career, it's just... Oh, you know, it's just whatever. I didn't say that. You didn't have to. Beth, why are you blaming me for this? You wanted to come on this trip too. Well, yeah, for you! But you can't put this all on me! I'm sorry, I'm glad that you can just go on vacation and not have to think about the future, but I can't do that. I don't have that freedom! I'm sorry, you think that there are no consequences for what I'm doing? If I don't make the right decision about this clinical trial, I could die. I'm not even gonna try to compete with that. I can't compete with matters of life and death, okay? All right, fine. The most important thing in my life is fashion. But guess what? It's still my life. And I still have to keep living it, regardless of what you choose to do about your health. Okay? Even if I lose you... Beth... (Phone chimes) Excuse me while I go save my job. Are you always this noisy when you get up? I guess last night we were trying to keep it down, so you're making up for it now. You're dressed. Yeah, I'm gonna head out. Wait, let me make us coffee first. Or breakfast. Anything you find, I can make it into a frittata. It's my greatest talent. Well, second greatest. Oh, no, I don't need all that. I just thought... Seriously, I have no expectations. This was just fun. Thanks for last night! Good times. Oh! My shirt. Bye! Bye. (Applause on TV) You sure you don't want to run those towels through the wash one more time? No, three cycles is enough. Oh! Nothing is enough when it's been used to soak up a big pile of... Yes, mom. I know what the towels soaked up. Please don't remind me. And I know it's my fault for not getting the toilet fixed earlier. I just didn't expect it to explode like that. Well, neither did I, but it was pretty hilarious. Yeah, up until the bill came from that plumber. I swear, that's a racket. Look. I'm gonna say this just once because Jeopardy is back on in two minutes. Something's got to give. You can't keep worrying over every little expense just because you're refusing to make bigger changes. What big change am I supposed to make? Brenna says she loves Charton. I mean, I can't just take that away from her now. Well, what about her college fund? You said yourself that Charton costs as much as college every year. Well, use that to pay for private school now. But if I spend the college money... Brenna said she doesn't want to go. And I'm supposed to just accept that? Well, you're supposed to accept your daughter for who she is, yes. Well, it's not that simple. Well, none of this is simple. Neither is Russian literature, but I know a lot about it. (Applause on TV) Beth : Hey. Uh... hey. I have to go home. Jaclyn's really pissed. I need to fix it. That sucks. I'm sorry. Good luck. You too. With your decisions. Thanks. Have a safe flight. (Indistinct chatter on TV) Let me call you back. Dude, last night? Stop it! Top ten nights of my life. So you and Julia had fun, huh? Do you see me smiling right now? I do. But under that smile, do you see a hint of me hating myself? Actually, no. Not today. That's because we had fun. Nice. The whole day was just so bomb. We seriously need a nickname for the awesome that happens when we go out together. "Daninic?" Huh? So what's next? I heard there's cheap Vegas flights. Wanna plan a weekend? Round two? I don't know. Well, the other option was "Donny," but that sounds like an actual man's name. A very lame man. - No, I just don't think I want to keep going out like that. But we just got started. That's the thing, I didn't. I used to have nights like that all the time. And now I feel like I want to have something more to show for myself than just a pile of chips. I want to wake up next to a girl I actually know. You know? No, that sounds annoying. And, Ford, just a reminder, your motivation in this scene is to prove to yourself that you're still attractive to your boyfriend. He hasn't been paying you enough attention lately, and your whole self-esteem depends on it. So I'm just super anti-feminist. No. No, no. You're just a relatable girl with insecurities. Pretend like you have insecurities. It's called acting. Okay, and hunter, you're totally distracted. You cannot stop thinking about your last one-on-one soccer practice with Nigel. Yo, time out. Can we pick a less lame name than Nigel? It's too late. This should have been addressed in the table read. We can't keep wasting time like this, guys. Okay. And, Ford, remember, really insecure, really timid. Okay. And... action. No, Ford, cut. Cut, Ford, no! Sorry. Sorry. I'm a method actress. That's not what that means. Hunter, remember, you're not attracted to her in this scene. He's not a good enough actor to sell that. Like, that's the issue here. Don't flatter yourself. You're not my type. Really? 'Cause I, um, felt otherwise. Whatever, dude. It's just a biological response. Okay, guys. Come on, we're never gonna finish this. We're going again. Ready when you are. Okay. And... Oh, wait. Hold on. One second. Really? Honey! What are you doing home so early? Oh, my gosh! Did you have the time of your life? Are you ready to start a clinical trial? (Sobs) Honey! Oh... (Sobbing) Mom... I don't know what I'm doing. Well, that's what Dr. Hamburg's for. Yeah, but at the end of the day, all these huge choices are still up to me. My health, marrying Leo. Well, you can always wait on that. You know, I mean, think about it some more. Mom. Fine. I am totally supportive of you and your whirlwind marriage. (Both chuckle) Oh, and that fight with Beth, it sucked. What if it's a sign that we can't relate to each other anymore? Well, lookit, this is the thing about growing up. There comes a point in your adult life when you realize that you're really the only one who can decide how you live. And that's a lot of power. Which is good. It's also really scary. You know, as Voltaire said, "with great power comes great responsibility." That's from  Spider-man. I'm pretty sure it's Voltaire. (Chuckles) And with Beth, that's just growing pains, which makes sense. You guys are changing so much. I feel like I'm basically a different person. I mean, I thought for sure I'd be living in New York, working for the Times, and traveling the world. I guess that's the thing. Everything changes, and all you can do is adapt. Like, sometimes you're about to make a super healthy dinner and your daughter comes in and forces you to order pizza. (Chuckles) That was one really easy decision. (Laughs) Sorry I screened your call. It may or may not be personal (Beep) Hey. It's me. I just wanted to say I'm really sorry about what happened on the trip. I wasn't thinking, or I wasn't thinking about you. I know you feel like I look down on your career, but that is so not true. You are killing it at work and at life. And I realize just how brave you are for always doing that so fearlessly. And I wanna do that now. So if you want... Come in. Whoa. You're getting an early start. Yeah, I'm gonna go meet Ford to shoot our last scene. She's really excited about the partial nudity. Yeah, I'm sure. Brenna, you know that I've always tried to protect you from having to worry about adult issues, like family finances. But you're 17 and I think that it's time that I started treating you like more of an adult. Right, okay. And part of that has to do with letting you in on what I'm dealing with. Can you please just stop for a second, and sit down? Okay. Um, I'm sure you have some awareness of the fact that April's medical expenses are high, and private school is a lot too. But, uh, I don't have the option to not pay for April's healthcare. So it recently became obvious to me that we're gonna have to make another sacrifice, as a family... No. (Sighs) Brenna... You're making me leave Charton? I don't want to. Believe me, this is the last thing I want to do. So you just, you go ahead and make this decision without even asking me? Wait, no, you did ask me, and I told you that I love school! So why would you ask me if you didn't even care about my answer? I did care. It's just that... I was weighing my options. Brenna, we just don't have the savings. So sell the house. Oh, come on. Really? You expect me to uproot the entire family right now? What about my college fund? You're not even an adult yet. Okay, wait, so now I'm not an adult? Over the next few years, you might change your mind about... So you still think that I'm going to college, after I told you a million times that I don't want to go! Please, let me finish. Even if you don't use that money for college, I want you to have choices in your life. You're gonna change so much between now and the time you're April's age. What if you want to travel? What if you want to make more of your short films? It's my job to make sure that you have the resources to grow and change. Whatever! All I do is change! Because you always make me! You took me out of public school and made me go to a prep school, where I didn't fit in with anyone, and now I finally do, and you're making me change my whole life again! It's not fair. I know, Brenna, but... Can you just... No, I have to go. I have to go meet Ford and tell her that I probably can't even enter this film festival. So thanks for that too. Beth : They're overreacting. You don't understand, Beth. The book is just really disturbing. Why? Well, he calls it a novel, but so much of it is just his life. It's about a man with two families. A wife and two daughters in Rhode Island and a mistress and b*st*rd daughter in South Carolina. Well, I mean, a lot of writers write about what they know. If anything, it just sounds like your dad wasn't that creative this time. You know? He didn't bother to change the details that much. But if that's the case, it's even creepier. In the book, he talks about how he's planned his own death. (Laughs) It's fiction. But what if it's not? Hey, how were the tropics? Wow, you got a tan! Yeah, I didn't wear enough sunscreen. But what's more cancer at this point? Mm. Funny cause it's true. So I spoke to the company that runs the Selkin trial and here's what we're gonna do. First thing... Okay, wait. I, um, actually found another one online that I want to do. It's called the Leitenberg trial. I know we haven't talked about it, and it's much more innovative, but I want to attack this as aggressively as we can. I get that. I just would prefer a later-phase trial at this point. Leitenberg doesn't have the same track record and the side effects could be... I know. I've read all about it. And I totally respect your opinion, but I know this is what I want to do. Well, then that's what we'll do. We'll get your blood counts and get you on that list.
