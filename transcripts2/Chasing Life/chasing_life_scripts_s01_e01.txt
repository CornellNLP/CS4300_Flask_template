 Excuse me, sorry sorry. 
 Cute baby. 
 Man on radio : Attention Boston baseball fans, if you forgot to check Twitter this morning, you might want to head on down to Boston Pediatric Hospital's charity blood drive. Why? 
 Well, they've just tweeted a contest: The first 500 donors get to meet celebrity host Richie Miranda! 
 (Woman moans) 
 (Man laughs) 
 Man : Alexis, control yourself. 
 Alexis : I'm sorry, but who doesn't love them a little Richie Miranda? 
 Man : Uh, police officers, drug counselors maybe. 
 Awww. 
 Man : I mean, the guy may be an all-star ballplayer, but he still got busted for drug possession. 
 If you still love him, go to that blood drive! 
 Maybe he'll give you an autograph, but hurry. 
 I hear there's already a pretty big line.

♪ You've been down... ♪ Excuse me, do I know you? Uh, yeah! I'm... O-H-J... Ojealo's from Nigeria. Yeah. (Knocks) April. I need to talk to you. I thought you said that you never wanted to talk to me again. What is it? Are your mother and sister okay? Oh, so now you care about our family? (Mumbles) Well, I have a very busy day. I really don't have time to rehash things that happened in the past, so... Look, I need your help getting into the blood drive downstairs. I'm trying to get an interview with Richie Miranda. He hasn't spoken to the press since he got out of rehab. Wow, so you've finally become a reporter, huh? Not yet. Still entry level, but if I get this interview, my boss might finally learn my name. All I need is your help getting past security. I'll do the rest. Woman on intercom : Dr. Carver, your patient is ready in 302. Well, I have a patient waiting, so... Right. Should've known. Dad always said the only people Uncle George cares about are his patients. April, wait. For coming. I'll get you in a minute. Man: You're the man, baby! I'll get you in a minute, I promise. How are you doing? Good to see you guys. Thanks for coming. How are you doing, dude? Good to see you. Hi, how are you doing, my man? Hi. How are you doing? Guess it's true what they say, Boston really does bleed for their team. (Laughs) Hi. (Laughs) Thanks for giving blood today. I just had to meet my favourite baseball player. I don't even know why I'm here. I hate blood and needles. I'm sorry. Hey, if there were more girls who look like you at blood drives, I'd have a needle in my arm all the time. (Laughs) Probably shouldn't joke about that. Oh, whatever. I don't believe any of the stuff people are saying. Yeah? Good. No, I mean you probably just took the fall for someone else on the team. But if it was you, I wouldn't judge. We all make mistakes. You'd still be my favorite. Seriously, you can tell me. What are you, a reporter? No! You are, aren't you? No. (Scoffs) Wait, no wait. Hey, security, hey! Wait! I told you no press! Can we get her out of here please? I really do have a thing about blood. (Monitor beeping) What are you doing? (Clears throat) You fainted. I was checking your vitals. There's no one else in this entire hospital who could do that? Relax, I'm done. Hey, sorry I didn't know you were here. You can't really leave a girl who bleeds all over you in front of a crowd of people. I'd end up all over the Internet... again. Anyway, now that I see you're okay, Peace. I'm not, actually! I'm dying and the only cure is an interview with you. You reporters are crazy, you know that? First you bat your eyelashes at me, then you're in here being a real you-know-what to some poor doctor who's just trying to help. That's my uncle. You talk that way to everyone in your family? No, it's just he... That's the first time I've seen him since my dad died and he didn't even bother to come to the funeral. I'm sorry. What, about my dad? It's okay. I got a lot of money out of it, so... Sorry, I get really awkward with emotional stuff and make inappropriate jokes. Uh-huh. I got that from my dad actually. He never took anything seriously either. Neither did mine. He just... passed away last week. Noone really cares about that story when there's this other whole scandal going on. That must be hard. It's cool. I got his motorcycle. (Laughs) No questions about drugs, okay? Yeah, okay. (Sighs) First question... ahem... what was the last thing you put up your nose? (Laughs) Bill, where are we with the campaign finance reform piece? We get a quote from Siena? Their office is getting back to me. So no. (Coughing) I don't even know your name, so I assume you're one of our floaters. Thank you for exposing the entire senior staff to your germs. It's allergies. (Huffs) And now may I take a moment to express my utter disbelief that Mark, my award-winning sportswriter, has not gotten us Richie Miranda. I've been to Fendway every morning. It's a fortress. Even the blood drive was no press, I tried. Miranda doesn't want to talk. Since when does anybody want to talk to the press? Break into his gated community,  find out where one of his illegitimate kids goes to school. Do whatever you have to. Start any time. Sorry? Your long and boring tale of why you're late to a meeting you're not even necessary at. Uh... You know, honestly I should just replace floaters with computers. Computers are never late and they don't get sick. (Coughs) Yeah, um, I'm planning on using one to type up my interview with Richie Miranda. Uh, we had a nice talk. Sorry I'm late. The blood drive ran long. The blood drive where no press was allowed? We'll run it in Sunday sports. I'll get you a draft by tomorrow. Oh no, you won't. Floaters don't write feature stories in major newspapers. Meet with Mark first thing tomorrow morning, download your notes to him. Nora, can you write a piece about the economy that won't make me want to kill myself? (Phones ringing) (Keyboard clacking) What, did you sleep with him? It's so unfair you get to have s*x for a story and I don't. Danny, you know how picky I am. I'm not gonna sleep with some dirty sports star who probably, like, chews tobacco. And I don't even get to write the story after all that. Guess it's called "paying your dues." I did not spend four years at Harvard to "pay my dues". (Male singer vocalizing) Hey, April, can I borrow a tissue? Finally admitting you're sick? No, you're just drooling a little. Just ask him out. I mean, aren't you one of those annoying girls that does that? A feminist? Yeah, that's what I said... one of those annoying girls. I don't know, it's different. Dominic's, like, an actual reporter here. Arts and entertainment? Please. You're such a snob. And I can't just start sexually harassing him. We just had that seminar. I think it's just sexual harassment when the power goes the other way. In this case you're under Dominic... Or you wish you were. (Elevator dings) Oh hey, can you hold that? You really wanted this elevator to yourself, huh? Yeah, do you mind taking the stairs? So, I heard everyone on the senior staff hates you now. What? Actually, I didn't hear that. But I'd hate you. You've been here, what, six months? And you already got a big interview? Yeah. My life is really glamorous. Now I get to go home and have dinner with my mom and my grandma, who I live with because I can't afford my own place. Well, if you feel like getting away later, I'm covering a show at The Hangover at 9:00. I could use a second opinion if you're free. Yeah, that should work. (Elevator dings) ♪ I want it, I need it ♪

I don't. She was a lazy bitch. Mm, no, she wasn't. She was a genius. And super hot. Can I get her number? (Giggles) So tell me everything. Dominic asked you out? Uh, I mean not technically. It's work-related. So make it not work-related. Feed him Tequila shots and pin him against a wall... done. Mm, no. Okay, or you could be a prude and talk about your feelings. I mean, I'm sure this dude would be into that. He has a scented candle on his desk. I never should have told you about that candle. It smells like trees. It's not, like, vanilla. Whatever. It's still a little metrosexual for me. You know, I prefer strong, silent types who watch sports and... and shoot guns. Beth, that makes no sense. You watch "Downton Abbey" and donate to the Audubon society. (Cellphone chimes) Since when does the brain govern Ugh, Uncle George. Haven't heard that name in a while. I know. I saw him at that blood drive this morning and now I think he wants to, like, be back in touch. And I... I just... I can't. Ugh. Oh, he's so awkward. Right? He even signed the text "from George." You know what? Just ignore him. He'll get the message. Or, you know, maybe he just feels awkward telling you they can't use your blood from the drive because you have an S.T.D. God, could you imagine? Coming from your uncle? "You have herpes. From George." (Laughs) (Video game beeping) Oh! Mom, you okay? She's playing bridge roulette. I wouldn't call it playing. These dummies don't even know how. It's roulette. Just switch to the next player. If I quit, my rating goes down and I will not be ranked lower than some fool in Indianapolis with a "Hello Kitty" avatar. Brenna, will you set the table? Can't. I'm working on my community outreach stuff. Oh! All right, never mind. Mom, what is wrong with you? I'm just proud of you! And I want to remind you where you were last year. Compared to now, it's... What an accomplishment when a child... Oh my God. Hey, I tell my patients all the time, I know how tough it's been these last couple of years for you. Not just you, this whole family. But, Brenna, when you were cutting classes and blowing off your schoolwork  for that boyfriend of yours... Okay, Sean was never my boyfriend. Okay, regardless. It's just on top of everything else,  getting the phone calls every day from school... Okay, I'm not blaming... this is not... "Dear mom: Please finish a sentence. Thanks, Brenna." "Dear Brenna: Please stop communicating with people by writing letters from yourself. Thanks, April." So... I have a little announcement. I'm thinking of joining one of those online dating services you guys keep talking about. You're too young to date. Wait, mom, are you serious? I'm thinking about it. I don't know. I mean I'm a therapist, wouldn't it look too unprofessional... No! Whatever. I'm taking your profile picture. Wait, no, I wanna do it. Hold on, wait wait wait. I thought you were busy. I want to do it. Can you believe I'm doing this? Don't look at me. I think you're asking to end up in a body bag. Shh. (Exhales) Mom, smile like a normal person. Well, I am! Ahem. (Camera clicks) Let's try serious then. (Clicks) (Snickering) Okay, mom, ew. (All laugh) What... don't... All right, delete delete! (Strumming ukulele) ♪ Fickle fickle, little heart ♪

I think I had that dress in kindergarten. And I had that voice. Another beer? Yeah, I can get it. (Sighs) I know, but I'm offering. Two more please. It's dollar-beer night. I think I can handle it. You are not making this easy. Making what easy? You get your own beers, you got your own cover charge, you held the door for me. I have a confession. I'm not reviewing this show. You're not? No. I just wanted to see you outside the office. Oh. Because, you know, we kinda joke around at work, and I don't know if you're just being funny or if... we're flirting. Well, are you flirting? I feel like if I answer this honestly... I'm just thinking about that sexual-harassment seminar. I was just talking about that! Oh, you were? In what context? Were you talking about dating one of your coworkers? I can't really remember. I think it was just in case someone started working there that I liked. (April in nasally voice) "We need to call service for the copier. Did somebody call service?" Pam from human resources! Uh... (Nerdy voice) "There's leftover pizza in the break room. It's sausage." Oh, duh, Geoffrey from classifieds. Okay, this next one requires a conversation. So start telling me about your day so far. Okay, I woke up to my little sister's alarm clock ringing... "I know her. I dated her." And then I think I turned on C.N.N... "I watch that, and B.B.C. That's the only TV I watch. I usually just listen to N.P.R." Oh, Danny Gupta. Sorry, I know he's your friend. Oh it's fine. I tell him this stuff to his face. I bet you do. You don't seem like the type to beat around the bush. Ooh, also not the type to use the expression "beat around the bush." (Phone rings) Oh, who's George? Booty call? No. Gross. See, you really didn't beat around the bush there. Oh my God. Every time you say it my entire body cringes with embarrassment for you.

And you know, you never bothered to come around when we tried to make you part of the family before, so it's not like you can just show up now... and think that you can... All right, April. It's not about me. It's about your health. What are you talking about? After you fainted today, I ran some tests on your blood. What? You have cancer. (Scoffs) I'm 24. Well... What kind of... ? It's leukemia. But we are trying some more tests. to determine exactly what the subtype is. Um... We can... we can... we can treat it though, right? It's treatable? Yeah. Okay, good. Treating isn't the same as curing. Whatever, how do we... how do we cure it then? I'm gonna be okay, right? As I say, we have to run more tests. (Window slides) April, is that you? Yeah! Sorry, grandma, I was just making a phone call for work. Now? They'd better be paying you overtime! (Sighs) I wish. Um, I'll be up in a minute. Okay. Uh, I have to go. So... okay. But you... come to my office tomorrow, we'll talk about everything there. I'll find another doctor. Why? I'm an oncologist. I'm one of the best in the state. At a children's hospital. (Sighs) Please, just come by, do the tests. You know it's in your best interest to let me help you, despite whatever you may think about me on a personal level. Fine. Okay. So I'll see you there tomorrow first thing, like 8:00, 8:30? I have a staff meeting then. You do know how serious this is, right? Yes, I just don't want to lose my job in addition to... this. Can I come in at lunch, please? Yeah sure, okay, yeah, okay. I'll see... see you tomorrow. I'm sorry. (Keys jingling) (Lock clicks, door opens) Mom.

I'm just a little out of it this morning. It was a rough night, huh? Yeah. I mean no. Uh, can we catch up later? I have a million things to do today. Yeah. Hey, Tasha. I'm meeting with Mark this morning. Is he in yet? (Yelling) I didn't ask how you were feeling. I asked to have the Miranda interview on my desk when I get back from lunch! Mark's out with the flu. He thinks one of the floaters gave it to him. You're not sick, are you? No. I'm not getting back from lunch tomorrow! I'm getting back today! Are you throwing up right now? (Typing) Thai food? Cheesesteaks? Paninis? God, you're like an Indian Jack-in-the-box. You're welcome, by the way. Hmm? For getting Mark sick, so you could steal his assignment? Huh? Sorry. I'm just...

Does he get the ball? Sorry. Yes, girl-from-yesterday? Uh, sorry. I wasn't listening or anything... Why weren't you listening? A good journalist always listens. I know you said you don't let floaters write stories, but since Mark is out, I did a draft of the Richie piece just in case it helps. No pressure, but if you could... George : April! There you are. Um, I'm just running into a meeting. (April sighs) I wanted to see if you were... Stop it! Come with me. Look, I know I was supposed to come in at lunch, but you can't just stalk me like this. I just had to make sure that you were okay. George, I'm fine. It's not like I'm gonna drop dead any second. I'm not, right? I read online that as long as you diagnose leukemia early you can... Begin treatment, but we don't even specifically know what we're treating yet, which is why we've got to act right away, especially if you're showing any symptoms. Have you noticed you're feeling unusually tired lately? Any bleeding from your nose or gums? No. Is that going to start happening? Look, I know this is... unfair, given all you've been through in the last couple of years. Oh, you... you talk about that like you had nothing to do with it, like you weren't there with him behind the wheel when he died. You know what? Nothing I can say to you is going to change how you feel about me. Clearly you've decided that I'm this villain and your father is a saint and that's up to you. But you've just got to put that on hold right now. Let me save your life and then you can go back to hating me. I haven't even told my mom yet. Can we just wait until I talk to her? I'll do it tonight. Please just keep this between us for now, okay? April, sooner or later people are going to find out about this. You can't keep something like this secret. And another thing, you cannot blow me off the way you did... Last night. From now on when I call you you've got to pick up the phone. Okay. Okay, George, I will. I know our relationship is-is... is complicated, but... I still love you. Girl : So if we could move this over there and that... Brenna, do you need a task? The soup is out. Isn't that, like, the one task? You can't just sign in and then leave again. Why do you care? Because I'm the president of this club and if our advisor finds out that I'm letting you leave... Well, then don't tell him. Chelsea, come on. Actually I think I'm gonna stay. Seriously? I'm, like, starting to think about college applications... Because some people care about their futures. (Honks) Whatever. I don't live for the future. We could all die tomorrow. Gotta have fun while you can. This is Sara Carver's voice-mail. I'll get right back to you. (Beeps) Hey, mom, it's me. I was just wondering if you're home yet. I'm leaving work a little early and I have to tell you something. Okay, see you soon! Hey, sorry I was weird earlier. It was a crazy morning. Don't worry about it. Leaving early? Yeah. Your flu is the gift that keeps on giving. I'll see you tomorrow. Cool. I'll probably still be here from today. I want Lawrence to see I'm not afraid to pull an all-nighter. Hey, April, Lawrence wants to see you as soon as he gets off this call. You know what it's about? (IM chiming) No. You are not totally illiterate. Thank you. But I can't run your story even if I wanted to. Mark has a quota of stories he needs to fill for his contract. Okay. Uh, well, thanks for reading it. Where are you going? I'm sorry. I thought that was it. No. I've got a question for you. Sit. What do you know about Bruce Hendrie? The real-estate developer? You hear he's running for governor in the next term? I... I... Don't lie. You wouldn't have any way of knowing unless you know his housekeeper who told my housekeeper... and yes, his housekeeper is legal,  so don't bother starting with that angle. I'm sorry, excuse me? Keep up. I'm giving you an assignment. I want you to profile this guy. Craig was supposed to do it, but he just gave his two weeks' notice. He's going to work for The Times. It pains me to say this, because I think each generation gets more and more vapid, but it's clear that youth is the future of politics.

No, no! Mom, that's awesome. Let me do your eyes. Come. (Sighs) Oh. Hey, what did you want to tell me? I got your message. Oh, um... I got my first big assignment from Lawrence today. Really?! Mom, you have to keep your eyes closed. Oh, April, I'm so excited! I can't wait to brag about you on my date! (Giggles) I'm so glad I picked up this purple eye shadow. I just felt like I needed a little extra something. I wanted something playful, but not juvenile playful, right? It's age-appropriate. I guess... you know what? A better word for it is "spirited." Spirited, I feel like... Mom. What's wrong? You're not finishing your sentences again. I'm nervous. I... haven't been on a date in 25 years. And now, what am I? I'm making myself look pretty to go meet a complete stranger. I don't know, maybe I'm just too old for this. Stop. Any man would be lucky to meet you. Look at you, you're hot. (Laughs) Yeah. You can do this. You deserve to meet someone. Who's the therapist here? Sometimes I don't know. Now take off the cape. It's a poncho. Oh, okay. Take off the poncho. It's... it's from Nepal.

Like, what do you have to lose? Okay, what's up with you? Hey, I didn't see you. Whatever. Yeah, you did. Why are you being weird? We had a great time last night. Is this just how you are with girls? Hi, I'm April. Look, whatever it is, just tell me. I hate drama. Really? That's kind of ironic. Why? I saw you talking to that George guy today. You did? What did... what did you hear? That you can't tell anyone you're seeing him and he loves you. He's the guy who called you last night, right? Oh no, he's not... It's cool. What is he, like, married? Are you waiting for him to leave his wife or something? 'Cause that's kinda the definition of drama. Dominic, he's my uncle. Wait. George is my Uncle. It's a secret that I saw him, because everyone in my family hates him, which is a whole long story. But that's who he is. So, no secret boyfriend. No. You're just sleeping with your uncle. Yes. Then that's fine. (Laughs) Can we just rewind and pretend it's last night again? Okay. (Phone vibrating) One sec. Ugh, it's my little sister. Bren? (Crying) April. Bren, where are you? Are you okay? No. (People laughing) Stay on the phone. I'm on my way. I'm sorry. Hey, sexy! Saved you a seat. Yeah, keep doing that. Girls love that. (Laughing) (Camera clicking) Dude, look, she's saluting us! Help me caption this. Hey. (Beeps, clatters) Bren, let's go. Come on. (Grunts) Move! (Retches, coughs) (Slurring) I owe you so much. I promise I'll never lie to you again. (Sighs) Please don't tell mom. She'll freak out. I won't. Thanks, Ape. I'm so glad you still live with us. If you didn't I... I would die. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to spy on you. I just... No no no, I'm the one who should apologize. Please, no daughter wants to watch her mother doing that. Not that there's anything wrong with it. It's natural, but I just... Mom, it's fine. Okay, so first he took me to an incredible flamenco performance... this Argentinean woman, Irina something... and then we went to Harvard square for dessert and talked until the cafe closed. And it was just... I don't remember being this happy. Is something wrong, honey? Yeah, I'm just... I'm tired. Oh, why don't you get some sleep? You know, maybe you should skip the tea. They always say it's caffeine-free, but I don't believe them. Come on, you go to bed. Thank you for tonight. I never could have done it without you. (Sobs) (Sobbing) Happy Birthday, dad. So I've got some pretty big news. I got promoted. Just kidding. I meant my other news. Maybe you already know. I don't know how this all works. (Sobs) Ohh. Anyway. So it looks like I might be seeing you sometime soon. And... don't take this the wrong way... (Sniffs) (Exhales) You're gonna have to wait a while. I'm not ready yet. Hey. Hi. Those are really pretty. Thanks. They're for my dad.
