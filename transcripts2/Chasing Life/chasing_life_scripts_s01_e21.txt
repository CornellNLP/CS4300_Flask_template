  Previously on "Chasing Life"...  
 As you all know, I had to make a decision on a new editor-in-chief. 
 Raquel. 
 Some of you may have picked up on this, but the "Post" is in trouble. 
 Just because you get one home run doesn't mean you sit on the bench now. 
 Natalie :  Dominic and I are seeing each other. 
 I shouldn't even have to ask you for permission. 
 We're family! 
 I already spent 22 years of my life feeling like I'm losing a man to you. I'm not doing it again. 
 Why are you looking at flights to Cleveland? 
 Oh, well, there's a conference on the psychology of illness. 
 George is giving a talk. 
 Yeah, I just wasn't expecting this. 
 We still need to run some more tests to make sure you're the best possible match. 
 Who's the patient? 
 I actually don't know. 
 Did those numbers stop dropping? 
 Hi, April. It's Dr. Hamburg. 
 Um, I would love to see you tomorrow morning for a follow-up, so give me a call when you get this. 
 I hope you have a great night. 
 Dr. Hamburg :   April. 
 Uh... but... what... 
 A couple weeks ago, you said you were 99% sure it hadn't come back. How sure are you now that it is back? 
 Your numbers were a little off, so I ran a peripheral blood flow cytometry... 
 Which confirmed it. 
 You have relapsed. 
 Guess I'm not getting off easy here, huh? 
 Chemo's not gonna cure me. 
 Not alone. 
 You're gonna have to have a bone marrow transplant. 
 Thank God we have... 
 Natalie waiting in the wings to be your donor. 
 (Flatly) Yeah, thank God. 
 (Sighs) 
 So how soon are we gonna have to do the transplant? 
 The next hurdle is to get rid of the cancer cells. 
 Again. 
 Since it's returned, what are the odds of me going into second remission? 
 Let's not focus on the odds. 
 So it'll be another month in the hospital. 
 Yeah. April, why don't you take a moment and let yourself react to this? 
 I reacted plenty last time and look where that got me. 
 I guess I'll just need some time to wrap things up, tell the "Post"... 
 And start chemo next week. 
 I need you to start first thing tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow? 
 I can't just drop out of my life that fast. 
 I... I mean, give me a couple off days at least. 
 I... I... 
 Last time with George, I didn't even start for a few weeks. 
 This isn't like last time. 
 Since your cancer has returned this aggressively and this quickly, it's much more serious. 
 It's still the same cancer as before. 
 How much more serious can it be? 
 April, I hate to put it in these terms... 
 But without immediate treatment, you only have two to six weeks to live. 
 Chasing Life 1x21 
One Day 
 (Bell tolling) 
 (Chatting) 
 Man :   I told you we weren't gonna be ready for the foundation before then. 
 I ain't paying money for your stupidity! 
 Hey, put your boss on the phone right now. 
 Uh, Leo? 
 (Piano music playing) 
 (People chattering) 
 Sara. 
 (Laughs) Surprise. 
 My God. I... 
 I can't believe you're here. 
 What the... oh, okay. 
 Wow. Hi. 
 Hi. I hope you don't mind. 
 It was a quick flight over... 
 Quicker than all the way to San Francisco. 
 It's been a few months since I've seen you, which I feel bad about. 
 It goes both ways. I should've reached out more, but my new job just keeps me so busy. 
 Oh, I'm sure. 
 I've been busy as well. 
 We both have, you know. 
 Doing new things. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, Mae. This is Sara, my sister-in-law. 
 She's visiting from Boston. 
 Oh. Well, hello and welcome  to the ever-exotic Cleveland. 
 (Both laugh) 
 So are you here to support this guy? 
 I am, yeah. Is that why you're here? 
 I'm actually part of the conference. 
 I run a pediatric cancer research clinic. 
 Oh. So you're colleagues? 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 (Chuckling) 
 (Cellphone ringing) 
 It's April. I'd better take this. 
 Hey, honey, what's up? 
 (Sighs) 
 Emma :  Son of a bitch. 
 God, how are you so calm about this? 
 There's just so many other people who deserve this damn disease more than you. 
 Pearl, for one. 
 Have you talked to your mom? 
 She's gonna try and make it home, hopefully before I go in tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow? Son of a bitch. 
 Sorry. 
 But since Mom's gone, Grandma, I could really use your help getting packed. 
 Do you want me to call Granny and Grandpa Carver? 
 I already did. 
 Well, what can I do to help? 
 I can skip school. 
 April and Emma : No, you can't. 
 But, Brenna, maybe you can reschedule your appointment with Dr. Hamburg. 
 No skipping anything. 
 Being a bone marrow donor is so important. 
 I don't want you slowing down the process by missing appointments. 
 Grandma, if you need to help April, I could get Natalie to go with me. 
 Emma :   Good idea. 
 Brenn, you're already late for school. 
 You should really go. 
 I'm so sorry, April. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 (Kisses) I'll start some laundry. 
 You know, I've been here before if there's anything you want to talk about. 
 (Sighs) I just... 
 I'm late for work. 
 And I still have to tell Beth... 
 And the "Post." 
 Are you gonna work all day? 
 It depends, but I was wondering about one other thing. 
 Maybe we could spend some time together... 
 Later at your place... 
 Alone. 
 Once I start chemo, there'll be certain things that we can't do anymore, probably for a few months. 
 Like say the word "s*x." 
 (Sighs) 
 (Chuckles) I think I can fit it in... 
 To my schedule. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Well, it's only cancer. 
 Right? I know. I feel like a wuss even complaining about it. 
 I forgive you. 
 Do you forgive me for having to postpone our Bermuda weekend? 
 We can just go when you get out of the hospital. 
 Who knows when that'll be. 
 So, along with our trip, I'll also be missing everything at work, Thanksgiving,  our families annual drive to Amherst to see the leaves change...  
 Brenna's 17th birthday. 
 Well, leaves are stupid anyway. 
 What? 
 I just had this... 
 Dumb thought that... 
 I might never have my own wedding. 
 April, you... You can't think like that. 
 I know. I don't, really. 
 I just... have these crazy thoughts sometimes. 
 Yeah, you could be a month of chemo and a bone marrow transplant away from putting all of this behind you for good. 
 You're totally right. 
 Damn right I'm right. 
 And in the meantime, who says you have to miss out on anything? 
 You still have the entire day ahead of you. 
 All you need for Thanksgiving is a turkey, and you can still celebrate Brenna's birthday today. 
 It'll just be a little early. 
 Well, we can't go to Bermuda and back in a day. 
 You know what? You just let me worry about that, okay? 
 And you go and get yourself out of work. 
 Okay. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Love you. 
 (Sighs) 
 (People chattering) 
 (Shouting) All right! All right! 
 I have given this newspaper  the best years of my life with my column "What the Heck,"  and you repay me by laying me off?! 
 What the hell?! (Chuckles) 
 I'm going full "Jerry Maguire" here! 
 I am starting my own newspaper founded on integrity and niceness! 
 Who's with me? 
 (Phones ringing) 
 (Murmuring) 
 (Mouths) 
 Paul. 
 This crappy paper is floundering and they're cleaning house with layoffs. 
 It's Black Tuesday. Nobody's safe. 
 Growing up, I wanted to be a baseball player, but no, my parents said, "you've gotta be practical. 
 Go to journalism school." Idiots. 
 I just started pricing vaginal rejuvenation costs. 
 This is seriously the worst time for money to be tight. 
 (Coughs) 
 April : Where have you been? 
 Out on assignment. The news doesn't always find us at our desks, April. 
 Sometimes we have to leave the o... 
 Danny, shut up. 
 Something big is happening. 
 Massive layoffs. 
 Mallory :  They're working their way through the lifestyle section. 
 Paul Peters and Matt the travel guy are already gone. 
 Dominic's in there now. 
 Who's the guy in the meetings? 
 Bob Reaser. He's this infamous media-efficiency expert. 
 H.R. hired him to come in here and make unbiased cuts. 
 They call him the "Grim Reaser." 
 So? 
 I'm safe. 
 What was it like in there? 
 Did they ask about time off or anything? 
 They mostly asked me what I'd done while I'd been here, and then they called me back in later to tell me that they're keeping me on. 
 Did they explain why? 
 The impression I got is that they're looking to cut back on the specialty columns, but it also looks like they're picking off the low men on the totem pole. 
 (Sighs) 
 It's gonna be me. 
 You've been a staffer here longer than I have. 
 I know they're gonna get rid of me. 
 You don't know that. 
 Phew! 
 (Sara sighs) What was I thinking? 
 I'm a thousand miles away from April while she's dealing with her relapse. I'm so stupid. 
 Yeah, but there's no way you could've known. 
 No, I never should've left. 
 (Beeping) 
 She must be terrified right now. 
 She's in the best care with Susan. 
 And I... I can't... Look at this. 
 This airline doesn't even have a flight to Boston today. 
 How is that possible? 
 There's one tomorrow with... 
 I've never even heard of Sandpiper Airlines. 
 I... I don't even know what I'm doing! 
 All right, come with me. Come here. Come on. 
 Where? 
 Come on. Just come on. 
 George, George, George. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Sorry. Excuse us. Sorry. 
 Excuse us. I'm sorry. 
 George. 
 It's all right. Hi. Sorry, excuse me. Sorry. 
 We have to get to Boston as soon as possible,  but your machines aren't being very helpful. 
 Um, I'm a triple-bonus platinum flier, so you need to wait in the back of the line. 
 No, I don't. Her daughter's starting chemotherapy in the morning, which I think pretty much trumps whatever tropical location you're going to. 
 Oh, please, go ahead. 
 It's... thank you very much. 
  (Keyboard clicking) 
 (Woman speaking on P.A.) (Beeps) I'm sorry, but there are no direct flights to Boston leaving out of this airport today. What's the earliest you could get me there?  (Keyboard clicking) (Beeps) There's a flight through Charlotte, arriving at Logan around midnight. Midnight? I know. I guess I'll take it. Actually, make that two tickets. I'm going with you.  (Keyboard clicking) (Credit card flicks) Man :  We thought we'd pretty much exhausted  the national registry over these last three years searching for a donor to match your type of bone marrow. Boys : Give it! Give it! But I have good news. Boys! That fart-sucker started it! Man 2 :  And I'm gonna finish it if you two don't knock it off. Sorry. Sorry. What's the news? We have a match. Finally. How sure are you? Well, at this point, it's a match, but we still need to test the donor to see how viable they are. Man 2 :   Well, is it a match or not? Dad. Right now... It's our best chance. Well, that's awesome, and it's good enough for me. Well, since we have a potential match, you'll need to meet with all the members of our transplant team as we start to move forward. That's our team psychologist, the social worker and the financial coordinator. Well, how... How much is the transplant? Anywhere from $100,000 to $200,000. Our... our insurance covers all that, right? You focus on your next couple of rounds of chemo to get you ready for your transplant. Okay, Finn? So... who's this donor? Well, donors on the national registry must remain anonymous. We don't even know where in the country they are. But whoever it is, I'm sure they know that they're doing something extraordinary. Brenna :  Hospitals totally creep me out. I don't know how April does this. Is she okay? Yeah, I... I think she's good. (Sighs) What's wrong? It's just... she and I had this fight the other night. About what? Kind of a long story. I don't know what I should do, though. Should I call her? I don't wanna make anything worse. April and I fight all the time. It's what sisters do.  (Door opens) Hey, ladies. It's good to see you again. How's April holding up? You know how she is. Always worried about everyone else. (Chuckles) How about you? You okay to do the test today, or should we put it off till tomorrow? I don't wanna wait. Okay. Well, then let's go through this questionnaire together, okay? Any recent flus, colds or upper respiratory infections? No. Any hospitalization and/or surgical procedures for any reason in the last two years? I mean, you'd probably remember something that was important enough to mention. I'm not talking about getting your wisdom teeth out or anything. (Chuckles) Yeah. Uh, no. Um... It's just that about two years ago I... Had an abortion, and I don't know if that counts. Not at all. No judgment. Regardless, you're gonna find something. You are so talented. Thank you, April. I guess this will give me more time to spend with my kids. Oh God. (Sighs) Mallory's out, too. They're starting the screening process with us in Metro next. Hey. I heard your conversation with Natalie didn't go all that well. I don't care about that right now. What's wrong? I haven't told anyone here yet, but I relapsed... For real this time. I found out this morning, and... I have to start chemo tomorrow. God, April. I'm so sorry. What are you still doing here? I don't want to lose my job and I can't just pop into Raquel's office and ask off for another month of chemo. With everything that's happening? And she called me out yesterday for slacking off. They can't lay you off because you're sick, right? That's a chance I'm not willing to take. With everything that I'm gonna lose after today... More time of my life, more of my health... I am not losing this job. (Sighs)  (Man speaking on P.A.) George : Here you go. Sara : Oh, thank you. You're welcome. What time are they gonna start boarding? Any minute, I guess. (Sighs) God, I hate not being there for her right now. I mean, she sounds like she's dealing with it okay... I just wish I could see her face. I'd know what she's feeling. Well, yeah, with the relapse, it's hard not to feel shock, fear, anger. Oh no, George. You didn't get to give your speech. I'm so sorry. It might not have been how I planned to spend the day, but I wouldn't have it any other way. You know, I... I'd do anything for those girls. It's harder than I thought not being around 'em. (Sighs) I'm missing everybody. 
 
 Woman on P.A. :  This is the final boarding call for...  So how's Emma doing? (Chuckles) She's dating. (Both laugh) Go, Emma. Wow. How about you? You seeing anybody? Not exactly, no. I was sort of seeing someone... An immigration lawyer in my building. Yeah? It didn't work out? No. I'm not sure his marriage is gonna work out either. (Scoffs) Yeah, something he neglected to tell me. And wasn't the guy you met online married, too? (Annoyed) Thank you, yes. How about you? Uh, no, I'm not married. Are you seeing anyone? No, not... not really. Because if you are, you can tell me. I'm totally fine with it. You know, don't you? That you're dating Mae? I mean, how did you... I'm just that good. It's new, but it's also old. We met years ago when I was in Doctors Without Borders. And you ran into each other again in San Francisco? Yeah. She doesn't live there, but she was visiting friends. And her clinic's in Portland, so... have a little commuting. For two people who wanted something easier, we sure landed into some complicated relationships. I cannot argue with that. Man on P.A. :   We will now begin pre-boarding of passengers for flight 323 to Charlotte. Oh yay. Hey, you doing okay? Uh, yup, but I think I might've had a little too much chemo today. Well, I'm cutting you off in a few hours then. (Chuckles) Did your family leave? Yeah. Sometimes it's easier when they're not around. Yup. I feel the same way about my family. (Both laugh) Wow. Look at that kid go. Yeah. That's me. Wow. Man, you were incredible. Yeah, I was. (People chattering) In a nutshell, the paper's in a dire situation. Aaron's tenure did more harm than good, which has led to some very desperate but necessary measures. Now, April, you joined the "Post" last February as a floater and were promoted to staffer in the spring. That's correct. April also weathered the more recent Miranda scandal. Mmm, I see here that you took a... Wow... four-month medical leave. Is that my permanent record or something? (Chuckles) You know, I think that we could use some time to review this. April, we'll need to meet with you again tomorrow. I can review that right now for you if that helps. We're tabling all employees with extenuating circumstances as we've got a lot to get through today. Raquel :  Thank you for your time. I can't meet with you tomorrow. The reason I was gone for four months before is because I have cancer. And the first time I found out, I was trying to control the situation, and well, it... Doesn't look like that's happening this time, because it's back. I love my job, I'm really good at it, and I want to keep it, but I have to start chemo tomorrow. I could be gone for another month, maybe even more, unless you wanna lay me off now. That's up to you. But I have to go and prepare for tomorrow. We'll discuss and get back to you. Thank you. I can't believe you made this happen in a matter of hours. I can't believe you continue to doubt my awesomeness. (Reggae music playing) It's not exactly Bermuda, but... Close enough, compared to where I'm going. Any word from Graham? Uh, nope. (Sighs) Nope. I thought he would've at least texted me, especially since he left his "Twin Peaks" DVDs at my place, which I've been using as indoor frisbees. Does that help with the anger? No no, I'm not angry. Mmm. Really, I'm not. I'm not! Okay. I'm not. I've been finding so much gratification in my job lately, despite all of its craziness. I feel like, for the first time in my life, I'm... I'm building something that's mine, and I have you to thank for that. Now you know why my job is so important ever since I got sick. (Sighs) The thought of losing it is so scary. April Carver, you are not gonna lose your job. No offense to your boss, Beth, but I had no idea Jaclyn was successful enough to own her own boat. Oh, this isn't Jaclyn's boat. Then who's is it? Hey! What are you girls doing on that boat? Oh. Okay, lunchtime's over. Lunchtime's over. What?! Oh my God. Man : Yeah, lunchtime is over. Beth : Let's go. April : What?! Beth : Yeah, would you like some couscous? You're just gonna be in the hospital. We can celebrate my birthday then. I know, but it won't be the same. I can't be outside like this, so make a wish. (Sighs) How do you feel about everything? Are you okay? Ah, you know me, if I'm not Lois Lane, I'm Supergirl, so... Well, I'm gonna come and visit you as much as I possibly can. I mean, it's gonna be a little bit harder because of school and stuff, but I'll come every day after school and on the weekends. Visit whenever you want to, not because you feel like you have to for me. I'll be fine. You need to go be a normal soon-to-be-17-year-old girl. Normal's never really been my thing. It was... really hard the last time you were in the hospital. And... I never told you this, but sometimes I would just pass through your room and start crying. I mean, I just... I felt like an only child and it sucked. You should be home with us. Well... since I can't be, I bought you this. What?! I'm not gonna be around for a little while, so I was hoping maybe... You would document everything I'm gonna miss. I will. Thank you. Happy Birthday, Brenn. I love you. I love you too. (Cellphone rings) Hey, Mom, where are you? We're in Charlotte. April :   "We"? Yeah, Uncle George is coming back with me. (Excitedly) Really? Uncle George is coming back with Mom. That's great. (Laughs) The girls are excited to see you. Honey, our flight doesn't leave for a couple of hours, so it's gonna be late. Ask her what Susan is planning. Do you need to be at the hospital by 8:00 again?  Yes. Right, and since the last chemo didn't work, will they have a different cocktail? Now what about the blasts? Hey, what was the percentage of blasts? And will they... Will they have the same flow markers as at your original diagnosis? Or is that... Leo : No word from the "Post"? I was checking the time. And your voice-mail. When did you get to know me so well? No, no word yet. I'm trying not to think about it, though. So... (Sighs) Should we do it? I guess. Yeah. Wow. Scheduled s*x is, like, the least romantic thing ever. I hear middle-aged couples and passionless marriages do it all the time. All right. I'm really uncomfortable now. Well, let's see if we can't... Get comfortable.

(Chuckles) What are your plans for the rest of the night? Thanksgiving dinner with my family. Oh, can I come? Of course. I should warn you, though, my sister and grandma are preparing it, and... (Chuckles) They're not exactly the chefs of the family. It's sweet of them to do it, though. I'm sure it's helping them deal with it, you know? It's really hard... Knowing how much pain this is putting them through. Well, you don't have to worry about me. I've been hearing rumors at support group about these... s*x substitutes. You know, women who fulfill all the needs of the caregivers. Hey, do you mind if I just meet you at my house in an hour? Was it the surrogate thing? I'm... I'm sorry. I'm not gonna use 'em that often. No no no, um... I just wanna do something first. Well, why can't we just go together? I'll be fine. (People chattering) Hey. Hi. Umm, I'm so sorry for not calling or anything. Brenna told me, but I just... After the other night, I didn't know what to say. I still don't. Considering the day I'm having, you dating my ex-boyfriend is the least of my worries. (Sighs) I'm not gonna keep you from doing what makes you happy. So you're okay with me and Dominic dating? I'm not gonna keep you from doing it. Let's just leave it at that. Do you still want my bone marrow? I'm gonna need it. It's yours. I need something else. I don't know how things are gonna go for me. This relapse is... It's really not good, and I want... Just watch out for Brenna, okay? (Crying) Take care of her. Be the... (Sighs) Be the big sister that I can't be for her right now. I will. Thank you. Son of a bitch. Yum. I couldn't get a whole one, and now these are all dried out. Leo :   Mmm! April :   It's fine, grandma. Looks like a turkey autopsy. Mom texted, she and George are gonna be boarding soon. Oh, finally, some good news.  (Sizzling) Grandma, is that the stuffing? Son of a bitch. (April and Leo laugh) Well, is there... Is there anything else that you need before tomorrow? What's going on with you? I'm suffocating you, aren't I? I guess I've never been on the other side of this. I've always been the one going to the hospital, not the one being left behind. It's harder than I thought. You've never had to be the one thinking about losing someone. I'm not losing you. (Woman speaks on P.A.) Sara, I really gotta say I'm... I'm... I'm so impressed. (Laughs) With what? Well, just... The way you handled April earlier. You seem to have really risen to the occasion. Well, it's not my first rodeo. I had to learn fast. I don't have much of a choice. Well, I just didn't think you'd have to do so much of it... alone. Uh, you know, when April... Admitted to you all that she was sick, that... I imagined I'd be the one with you until she was cured, not living in San Francisco. No, you did what you had to do. Yeah, I did what I thought I should do. There's a difference. You having regrets? It's not easy seeing everybody move on without me. Just feeling... Unnecessary. No, you are not unnecessary to us. That's why I flew to Cleveland in the first place. I don't want what happened between us to keep you away from the family. Or... from me. Woman on P.A. :  Ladies and gentlemen who are flying flight 1282 to Boston, we have some bad news. Due to mechanical failure,  this flight has been cancelled. (Both groan) No! Woman 2 : Seriously? No. So we'll see you tomorrow, Finn? Uh, yeah, can't wait. Actually, I can, but I don't really have a choice. That's the spirit. And... congrats on your donor, by the way. Thanks. You know, things are really starting to look up for me, which is good, 'cause track trials are starting up in the spring, and I'm ready to kick a little ass. Yeah. Well, after transplants, it can take months to fully recover and get used to your new immune system... Yeah. If not years. Hey, if there's someone out there willing to help me get a second chance, then I'm not gonna waste it. - See you. (Chuckles) - Arrivederci,   bro. (Phone rings, beeps) The stuffing tastes like tire. Shh. Be quiet and eat your tire, okay? (Laughter) I love my tire. Grandma, what's going on? Umm, that was your mom. Their flight was cancelled,  but they're gonna do their very best  to get here as early as possible tomorrow morning. April, are you okay? (Doorbell chimes) You guys sit. I'll get it. Raquel. Hi. This is a nice place. Thanks. Can I come in? I'm truly sorry to hear about your relapse. Thank you. I'm guessing that's not the only reason you're here, though. It's down to you and Danny. There's no way around it, and you've made it abundantly clear to me that you're not feeling as compelled as Danny does to go that extra mile for the paper. And right now, that's what the paper needs, the die hards. No pun intended. So you're laying me off. That was my recommendation, but Bob informed me that you could have grounds for a lawsuit because of your health. So basically, you might get to keep the job, by default. So then Danny will be out... Because of my cancer. (Inhales deeply) (Whispers) You've gotta be kidding me. It doesn't seem fair, does it? Fair went out the window for me about eight months ago. (Chuckles) I quit. I'm really sorry, April. (Soft rock music playing) (Woman vocalizing) ♪ Pray God you can cope ♪
