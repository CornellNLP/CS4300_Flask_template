 Narrator :  Previously on "Chasing Life"...  
 Are you guys, a: Dating, or b: Just other stuff? 
 B. 
 I realized that my period was two weeks late. 
 I told Jake and he wrote me a check so I could take care of it. 
 Beth Kingston, will you move in with me? 
 I want to take a year off to travel. 
 O-kay. 
 Natalie :  I kind of made out with your ex-boyfriend. 
 Um, Dominic? 
 It would never happen again. 
 You've got, like, nothing to worry about. 
 I never felt this way about anyone. 
 Man singing :  ♪ Sometimes I wake up with a sadness ♪ 
 ♪ other days... ♪ Leo :  We all have private parts. ♪ What would I do without ♪ But there's one part I consider private that not everyone does... The heart. ♪ Shades of gray ♪ It's a vulnerable organ. It breaks easily. Some people are lucky enough to know what it feels like when it's full. And then there's everybody else. I happen to be one of those people. I've never been in love before. April :  That is so romantic. (Chuckles) Yeah. We had dinner and there was candles, and then Graham asked me to move in with him. Wow. Right? (Sighs) But, Beth, you guys have been dating, like, barely six months. Isn't that a little fast? Not really, no. I care about Graham more than any guy I've dated in a really long time. And he's right. We won't see each other if we don't move in together. And I kind of like the idea of waking up with him every morning. That's good. It's just I remember Dominic talking about how challenging it could be to live with Graham sometimes, and... But if you feel like it's right, then I'm happy for you. Thanks. I have some good news too. Mm-hmm. Leo and I are giving it another chance. Wow. You don't like him, do you? No, it's not that. Just I'm... I'm skeptical. I wouldn't mind seeing something to convince me that this guy is good enough for my best friend. Well, here's an idea. Why don't we do a dinner party with our boyfriends? Like a double date? This way I can get to know Graham as more than Dominic's roommate who complains all the time, and you can get to know Leo as more than the guy that messes with my head. But, wait, do we have to cook? Please. Yet another reason why I love you to death. Uh... Oh, wait, not death. I didn't mean death. No death. No death, sorry. Awkward. (Both chuckling) ♪ You bet your soul, honey ♪ 
♪ you bet your soul ♪ 
♪ just right ♪ 
♪ you could stay all night ♪ 
♪ and never want to go home ♪ 
♪ 'cause we can't stop ♪ Brenna :  I have told her a bunch of times I want to take a year to travel, but she keeps dropping the most obvious hints about applying to colleges, "just in case." Like that's her way of being supportive. What did your parents do when you said that you weren't going to college? They were fine with it. They're into "whatever makes you happy." God, I am so jealous. Okay, now you're just showing off. (All laughing) So you seem good. I mean, it's been a while since I've seen you, but... But last time you did, I was crazy. I didn't say that. Actually, you did. You, like, literally said I was crazy. Right, that. Uh, sorry sorry. I mean, it's fine. You weren't wrong. Uh, but I'm back on my meds now. And you feel okay? Yeah, I feel fine. I mean, I only stopped taking them to piss off my parents. And they didn't even notice. So I'm sorry to say, Bren, but in the sucky parents department, I'm always gonna win. (Leo and April giggling) I can't believe we almost stopped doing this. Let's never stop doing this. Okay. Wait wait, what are you doing tomorrow night? No stopping. Seriously. Beth and I want to have a dinner party with you and Graham. It'll be fun. Yeah, what wouldn't be more fun than having dinner with your ex-boyfriend's roommate? Graham will behave. Yeah, but what about Beth? I bet she hates me. What? No. I know you tell her everything. Not everything. She just doesn't really know you... yet. (Sighs) Okay. But, look, if they gang up on me, I cannot be held responsible for my actions. Mmm. Ah! Oh, is it time for a little show? No, it's time to get ready for yoga at support group. Oh, yeah, um, about that... You love yoga night. Yeah, but I've... I've thought a lot about it, and I... I think I'm done with support group. What? Why? Well, I mean, given the past month, I think I need a little less cancer in my life. It's been all cancer all the time. I just feel like I need to distance myself so I can... I can move on, you know? Focus on right now. Okay. Guess I'll just have to find someone else to help me stretch. (Whispering) Who are we hiding from? (Sighs) No one. I just thought I saw one of my clients who's kind of clingy and I didn't want it to be uncomfortable if I was, you know... (Laughs) You're a terrible liar, which is surprising, since you spend all day pretending to be interested in people's boring stories. They're not always boring. (Clears throat) So why are you sneaking around? Is it because you attacked me in your office  and now you're having regrets? 'Cause personally, I thought it was hot. I'm not saying it wasn't. You know... Hot. Right. It's just that, I... I'm not looking for anything serious right now, in terms of the s*x. And, I mean, it was nice. Nice? Not nice. It was enjoyable. Oh. It was definitely enjoyable and nice. Yeah. Please say something. Just so you know, I'm not looking for serious either. Last time was easy. Let's just keep it that way. It's been a while since I've had easy. Easy sounds perfect. Well, want to have it again soon? Sure. Why not? Yeah. Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night. Mmm. Were you actually on your way out? 'Cause you can go now. Yes, I was. (Laughs) (Door opens) (Music playing) (Laughs) What brings you here? Maybe I'm biased, but it can't be the food. No, it's a work thing. I'm meeting Jonathan Richman's manager at 7:00 for this review that I'm doing. It's only 6:30. I know. It was great running into you at the bookstore. You know, I checked out your book after you left. And? I still don't get the helmets. Well, creating fictional personae in real life. It's like... it's conceptual. It's pretentious. I take it you're into music that's a little more... Awesome? Yeah, I'm kind of a Katy and Ke$ha girl. But it's not like I only ever listen to party music. I like some classic stuff. Yeah? Like what? Well, my dad used to bring me records whenever he visited. Springsteen, The Stones, The Hollies. Mm-hmm. I used to be obsessed with that song, "the air that I breathe." Love that song. It's so good, right? Yeah, those records were, like, the only way I felt connected to him when he wasn't around. I guess that's kind of a bummer, but... No, gives the music a lot of power. All my favorite albums, there's some kind of story there. You probably think that sounds pretentious. That's why you do what you love. April. Hey, guys. Look who I ran into. I'm here for work. Cool. I was just going to get a tea to go. Oh, I got ya. Everything okay with your health? Brenna said there was a scare? Yeah, I... I'm okay. Thanks for asking. Thank you. All right, well, don't work too hard. No chance of that. See ya. So that was weird. I don't know why I panicked. I just felt like we were... We were doing something wrong? I know. But we're not. We're allowed to be friends, right? I mean, April's with someone anyway, which doesn't matter, since we're not even talking about dating. Right. I mean, we only made out that one time, before we knew each other. Hardly counts. So let's just keep being friends and not worry about it, okay? Well, you know what? If we're friends, I should have your number, right? Okay. Back to work. Nice seeing you, friend. So I heard there might be trouble in paradise. You mean between Leo and me? I'm afraid your source is inaccurate. Oh. So where is he? Um, he decided that he's not going to come to support group anymore. He kind of wants to distance himself from cancer now that he's healthy. Oh. Why, what's up? Well, I'm helping with this fundraiser for private parts cancer. You know, testicle, breast, ovarian, cervical. How philanthropic. Yeah. Well, it's this week and there's still a ton to do. Well, I can volunteer. And I bet a lot of my friends would want to help too. I know I still owe you after that Amy Snow situation. Well, that'd be great. Thanks. But what we really need is an M.C. I was going to ask Leo because he's kind of a big deal. I heard he was sort of a one-man make-a-wish foundation before his surgery, and he was on TV a lot for his dad's campaign. You sound like a fan. Well, yeah. And we have the same taste in women. So how can I get him to host? Do you think if you asked him, he'd do it? Yeah, I'll get him to do it. Awesome. (Thunder rumbling) (Vibrating) Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay? I tried to talk to my parents. I told them I didn't like how much time they were spending away from home, and my mom... She didn't even let me finish. She just started yelling at me about how I don't understand respect. I'm so sorry. Could I stay here tonight? Um... Yeah. Just be really quiet, okay? I feel like I do everything that she wants, and it's not enough. Like, I don't even know what she wants anymore. I mean, come on, how are you not enough? You're the best daughter she could possibly hope for. She doesn't think so. Well, she's wrong. (Music playing) Graham : Here's one. Ah, no. I'm not living there. I work late, and that T stop is sketchy. Mmm. Why are you, like, thinking about whether that's legit? It's legit. Well, what if I just walked you home from the T every night? Then I'd end up defending both of us. Let's just be honest with ourselves. And you know, I'm sorry, but safety makes a lot more sense as a deal-breaker than not having an elevator. Uh, a.K.a., tremendous power suck and oil suck, two limited resources in our world. It is so like you to have a list of things that you don't want in an apartment. You don't want an elevator, you don't want a coffee shop within walking distance. All right, you know what's going to happen if we live near a coffee shop, right? We're going to end up spending five bucks a day on lattes that we could just make ourselves. Okay okay, so no elevator, no coffee shop nearby. Is there anything else that you just can't tolerate? Yeah, your mattress. What's wrong with my mattress? Nothing. Just mine's way better. What are you talking about? (Sighs) Guess I have to show you now. Come on. Hey, you know, I'm really going to have to fight you on this whole mattress thing. Oh, yeah, we're going to battle it out for at least 20 minutes. Go go go go! 20 minutes. Start now, go! Hi. Woman :  Hi. I'm... I'm Dr. Carver. Are you my 3:00? Actually, no. I'm here to see Owen. Oh, sorry. I just assumed because you seem to be from here... I am. Vivian Gordon. I'm Owen's wife. I wanted to see his new office so I thought I'd surprise him, but he must be taking a long lunch. Would you mind letting him know I stopped by? (Knocking) You wanted to see me? I could barely read this, by the way. Yeah, well, my handwriting sucks when I'm angry. Well, why are you... I had the pleasure of meeting your lovely wife earlier. Please tell me that was for a green card. Were you ever going to mention that you're married? Very sorry. It's complicated. We just... You know what? No, it's not. As someone who's been cheated on before, it's not complicated. You don't cheat. Simple rule of respecting another person. Or in this case, two people... Her and me. I had no idea that you'd been through this before. That's right. You have no idea. You have no idea what it's like to find out that you've been taken advantage of for years by someone you love,  or to meet the other woman in your own home, or...  You know what? You don't deserve to know any of this. Sara, wait. Just leave. Mmm, this chicken's amazing. Thanks. Beth helped. By holding the take-out bag while you paid for it? Yeah, what's wrong with that? Um, look, I think I should clear the air here. Uh, if you're picking up on an underlying hostility, I apologize. It's just Dom's my boy. You stole his girl. But he's moved on, so I'm going to try to do the same, okay? Um, thank you. Yeah, put it right there. Ow. So how is the apartment search going? Great. Not great. Oh, you guys are moving in together? Well, congrats. Thanks. Have you ever lived with anyone before? Um, romantically? No. I haven't really had any long-term relationships to speak of. Um, it's kind of hard to plan a future with someone when you don't know if you're going to have a future. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. You think that's all it was, though? Did you maybe have a fear of commitment? Ow. Maybe we both do. I mean, I've never lived with a boyfriend either. I don't think that necessarily means he has a fear of commitment. In fact, Leo commits a lot of his life to inspiring other cancer patients. See? I'm a good person. Oh, and Leo, I ran into Julian last night at support group. Apparently, you've inspired him too. He is organizing this cancer fundraiser and he wants you to host. I think that just means, like, showing up, maybe making a speech. Uh, yeah, I don't know. I've been such a mess lately. I don't think I'm the best person for that kind of thing. I've seen you speak in public for your dad before. You're amazing. Well, yeah, but I always had a speechwriter for those things. I don't... we already talked about this, remember? Um, I kind of already told him that you'd do it. I'm sorry. I'll tell him that I can't. That's okay, I'll tell him. I could speak. You know, I like speaking. Yeah, we're well aware of that. (Phone ringing) Yello? Hey, it's Dominic. You working? Yeah, but I can talk for a few. So I rode by the sidewalk sale this morning. And I am now the proud owner of a Hollies album from 1974, the one that has "the air that I breathe" on it. No way. Well, actually, you're the proud owner, if you want it. You got it for me? It was just a couple of bucks. Well, thanks. I can't wait to hear it. So any big plans tonight? Uh, I was just going to head home. You kind of live over by downtown, right? Uh, yeah, near where you work, I think. Yeah, I'm actually there now. Probably gonna be here late. Want to just swing by and grab the record? Is anyone there? Like April? No, it's just me. Not that it would matter if there were. It's not like we have anything to hide. Um... Brenna :  So remember what I said? Let me go talk to her and don't come out here until I tell you to, okay? Hey, Mom. Can we talk for a second? Honey, I just need 15 minutes to decompress and grab a glass of wine. Mom, just... Please, Brenna, just... (Sighs) Please don't flip out, okay? I'm just trying to be honest with you. That's what you always say you want, right? So I'm being honest. Greer came over here last night. She had nowhere else to go. She was here last night? You stayed overnight? I got in this huge fight with my parents and I couldn't stay there. I was desperate. It was really bad. My mom has been getting upset, like, every day. I think something's going on with her and me. I don't really know, but I just... I can't go home. I'm sorry, Greer. Mom, please, can she just stay here until she figures out what to do? Do your parents even know you're here? Not exactly. Well, I'd feel more comfortable calling them so they know where you are. I mean, I don't need them accusing me of anything. Okay. 
 
 (Record playing) This song is so happy-sad. Know what I mean? Yeah. It sounds even sadder on vinyl. Reminds me of when I was, like, 12, throwing things across my room in a rage. Violent kid, huh? Just angry. Being a love child can do that to a girl, until you make peace with it. How'd you do that? I don't know. I got tired of being angry all the time. And I started to see my dad as this flawed guy who did the best that he could, which wasn't great. But I basically realized that if I shut him out, I'd lose him. And then I wouldn't have a dad at all, so I went with it. And I'm glad I did. That's pretty mature of you. Really? Wow. No one's ever called me mature before. Seriously, I wish I could deal with my stuff like that. Do tell. Later. Why not now? What? I told you, just friends. I'm getting along really well with April lately. I don't want to mess it up. Are you really going to let girl code keep you from something? Yes. I don't have a lot of girlfriends or half sisters. ♪ Is the air that I breathe ♪ Okay. If that's what you want. ♪ All I need is the air that I breathe ♪ Thanks for coming tonight and for bringing me home. Oh, yeah, you can't be too careful on the mean streets of Beacon Hill. Hmm. You're welcome. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Yeah. Is everything... (Knocking) Um, sorry. Julian. It's kind of late. I thought we were going to do this tomorrow. Did you come here by yourself? Uh, no, my mom drove me. Don't bother. She parked on the next block. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Okay. Now are they finished? Uh, please. I have a reputation to uphold too, you know. Come on in. I'll be right back. Sorry. Signs. She's getting the signs that she printed up at the newspaper for the fundraiser. It's gonna be great. I mean, we both invited, like, tons of people. Thanks for helping out, by the way. Oh, right. Um, I'm... I'm sorry, buddy. I know April said that I could do it, but I actually... I can't. Oh, uh, why not? Why are you going through all this trouble? What's... what's her name? Who? Come on, you're a 14-year-old boy organizing a fundraiser. There's got to be some girl involved. I'm donating all the money we make to this organization to help my family pay off some of the medical bills last year. Oh. You know, April told me that cancer isn't really your thing anymore. I thought that was kind of sad because people used to really look up to you because of it. I mean, having people look up to you for anything is kind of awesome. You shouldn't turn your back on that, especially when your amazing girlfriend asks you to do it. 'Cause there are girls and then there's April. She's in, like, a whole different category. So even though I'm not doing this for a girl, maybe you should. I'm gonna take the sofa, but I was wondering if we could talk for a sec. Yeah, sure. What's up? (Closing door) Um, nothing much, except you kind of kissed me last night. Oh, yeah. That. (Laughs) Um, I don't know. I wasn't planning it. I mean, I definitely wasn't expecting it. But I didn't hate it either. But I wanted to ask you something, and it may seem kind of random. It's about what you told Kieran and me that night at the gallery. Okay. I was just wondering, do you think that's the reason you wanted to date a girl? I'm just curious because it makes sense. You know, like, after you went through all that with that guy, that you'd feel safer with a girl. I mean, it might be the reason I never had s*x with Kieran. It's hard to get that kind of thing out of your head. I still think about it. Every once in a while, I think about how old the baby would be by now or if he or she would be walking yet. But that's not why I started liking you. I mean, that was just about you. I was in a dark place before I met you, between my dad dying and April. And then I started to get to know you. And I don't know. It was like the sun was finally coming out after a month of rain. Or whatever, I'm sorry. That sounded super dumb. No. It doesn't. It's perfect, right? In a safe neighborhood, since that's so important to you. You're annoying. No elevator, but we're on the second floor. There's an unpretentious coffee shop half a block away for your blatant consumerism. (Laughs) And they're waiving the deposit. I mean, it's pretty great. Right? You know about the two-year lease, right? Yup. Wait, what? That's why there's no deposit. The lease is a little longer. Two years isn't a little. I... I'd assumed, like, six months. Why would you assume six months? I mean, most leases are, like, a year. Because the last two that I signed were for six months, you know, with options to go month-to-month afterwards. So you're literally saying that you want a short-term commitment. Two years just seems like a really long time. You know, who even knows where we'll be in a year? I mean, I assume we'll want to be here, living together, right? I'm sorry, I'm trying. I really am. I just haven't lived anywhere for this long, since I left home. You do realize that it's going to be impossible to find exactly what we want with a six-month lease. You don't know that. All we have to do is ask. Wow. I guess it's true what they say about people of your generation, just always wanting everything on their terms. My generation? Graham, you're 29. Well, sometimes you act like a very young 23. Did I mention we allow large pets? (Knocking on door) Sara. We need to finish our conversation. Okay. I want to know why you cheated on your wife. You're just jumping right in there, huh? I'm sorry, did you want to have small talk? I mean, I kind of think we're past that. Okay. Um, it's complicated. Again with the "complicated." Yeah, all right, well, let's see. Your needs were not being met, your masculinity was threatened and you needed validation, You're wrong. Okay. You know, maybe what I'm wondering is are you still attracted to your wife? Yes. Absolutely. But are you still in love with her? Very much. More than she probably knows. Look, before Vivian and I even got married, we talked about cheating, how we felt about it, and if it was just physical, that we'd rather not know. 'Cause you know, life is long. And so if we went through a phase where we were feeling a little... She probably told you that because she thought that's what you wanted to hear. No, Sara. (Chuckles) You don't know her. So what happened? Well, Vivian and I have been trying to get pregnant for years. And we're on our fourth round of I.V.F. We never have s*x anymore. And when we do, it's so clinical. And the stress has just made us need some space from each other. But I do think that we're going to find a way to make it work and get back to a good place, though. And so when we do, you know, I think what Vivian doesn't know won't hurt her. And for all I know, she's doing the same thing. And you really wouldn't want to know? Well, at the end of the day, what good is that going to do me? I mean, if you had found out  that your husband was cheating on you right after it happened,  do you think your life would be better? (Both giggling) Thank you guys so much for helping out with the fundraiser today. Is Leo meeting us there? Um, I don't think so. I don't know. It's kind of a bummer, actually. (Doorbell rings) April : I'll get it. (Both laughing) Greer? Brenna. Father :  We got a call from your mother, Brenna. She said you were here. You could have called first. We were just... This has nothing to do with Brenna. Believe it or not, I can actually think for myself. Mother :  We're not impressed with your judgment. Of course you're not. Nothing I do ever impresses you, Mom. You're impossible to please. And you know, it's really hard growing up thinking nothing I do is good enough. Welcome to the club. Get your things. You're coming home. No. You can't just leave town and then show up and pretend you know anything about my life. Like, I went off my meds and you didn't even notice. You let nannies and psychiatrists raise me because you don't know what to do. You suck as parents. Oh, and by the way, Mom, there is no way I'm going to boarding school. What's she talking about? We'll talk about it later. Go ahead, threaten to withhold money from me. I'll figure something out. I'll be staying with Brenna until you learn how to treat me with some respect. Okay. If you want to play little orphan Annie, we won't stop you. You're kind of my hero right now. Hey. Hey. Um, do you want to come in? Am I allowed? I kind of thought after this morning, you might make me talk to you out in the hallway. The hallway? Come on. No, there's a perfectly good closet right over there. Uh, hey, so I... I'm really sorry about earlier. Me too. It's... This... this is just hard. You know? Well, I'm about to make it really simple for us. So against all odds, and I mean all, I found us another place, meets our needs, including your need for a six-month lease. All you got to do is sign. Wow. Or... or not. Can I... Can I just have a second? Yeah yeah. What's wrong? I just... This just, uh... Wow, it feels really fast, doesn't it? What are you talking about? I mean, us moving in. (Laughs) You... you're bringing this up now? I'm giving you everything that you want. Yeah, I... I don't know. I think I just... I... I need to think about it more. Okay. (Chattering) Is it petty to be disappointed that Leo is clearly not even showing up? I mean, it's just this one thing I asked him to do. Are you right and this is just another red flag that he's going to hurt me again? Are you okay? I am literally the worst person in the entire world. He was totally bending over backwards to give me everything that I wanted and being so flexible. Graham? What's wrong with me? I used to love having the freedom to just leave at a moment's notice. You know, live in different places. And now I have this job that depends on me and a boyfriend that wants to live with me for, like, ever. Oh, I don't think I'm ready to be this grown-up. I'm... I'm just... I'm not used to this kind of permanence, you know? Beth, there are so many steps before this is a permanent commitment. You can always break a lease. This is just one small step down the road of being together for real. Yeah, you're right. God, you're so right. I've... I really don't want to lose him over this. Maybe we both need to compromise a little more. You know, maybe I need to manage my expectations better with Leo. I mean, he's dealing with a lot of stuff right now. So maybe I should just let him be who he is. Leo (Amplified) :  Testing, one two. Hello hello. This thing on? Hello? (Feedback) Oh, a little feedback. Testing. There we go. Hey, guys. I know what you're all going through. Thinking maybe if I'm lucky, I got a year left,  or two if I get into that clinical trial, right? I never expected to turn 22, let alone 25. Now I'm not here because I think I can cure cancer, although that would be awesome. (Laughs) But maybe I can be an example  of someone who beat the odds. Because it happens. Now we all have private parts,  but there's one part I consider private that not everyone does. The heart. It's a vulnerable organ. It breaks easily. And some people are fortunate enough to know what it feels like when it's...  When it's full. And then there's everybody else. I happen to be one of those people. I've never been in love before. Or I hadn't until now. He's never said that before. Well, it's about time. I approve, by the way. I almost didn't come here today. But since I've somehow managed to stay alive, I want to live the right way. I want to be the guy that steps up, I want to be the guy that people shouldn't ever underestimate. Love will do that to you, I guess. You'll find yourself doing things you never could imagine in a million years. (All applauding) (Laughs) Sara :  I got goose bumps. It was so romantic! And in front of all these people. He's so great. You know, if you weren't just hooking up with your immigration lawyer next door, maybe he would profess his love for you on the courthouse steps. Unlikely. Things have become complicated. Are you okay? I'm fine. Yeah, more than fine. I actually think some... Some good may have come from it. Do I want to hear this? It got me thinking about your father and how I've been repressing a lot of anger. Really toxic stuff. And I actually realize that if things hadn't happened how they did, even the really painful parts,  I would have missed out on some of the great things. (Girls giggling) I wouldn't be where I am right now, which is pretty happy. So they haven't tried to call you or anything? I think I scared them. Oh, good.

♪ 'cause it feels good ♪ Anyway, I'm just... I'm so sorry about earlier. I'm an idiot. I was scared. This is all really new to me and it feels like a big step, but you know what? It doesn't have to be. So I'm just going to try to keep my freak-outs under control while we live together in whichever apartment you want. See? Now look who's being flexible. I don't think I've ever seen you speechless. I think we have to break up. (Sighs) Is... is this because I freaked out? 'Cause I told you, that was just a momentary thing. No, it's not that. I mean, it is and it isn't. I'm not mad at you. It just... it doesn't seem like we're in the same place in our lives right now. (Music playing) What... what does that even mean? It means that I've been in relationships before where, uh, I wanted something and the girl wasn't sure and I thought that I could convince her, but it turns out that you can't... You can't change people. And it's better if I just accept that and, uh, not set myself up to get hurt down the line. ♪ Nothing to eat ♪
