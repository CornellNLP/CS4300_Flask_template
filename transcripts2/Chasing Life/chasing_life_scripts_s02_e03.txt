 Previously on Chasing Life... 
 This is a ring. 
 We're engaged. 
 Congratulations. 
 Natalie : I think you're still in love with April. 
 It's complicated. 
 Not for me. 
 I lied to my son. And that's a thing that he hasn't forgiven me for. 
 But all you can do is keep showing up and hope that one day, he'll be ready to. 
 Well, as the token straight girl... 
 Oh, I didn't know you were... 
 Yeah, they... they don't make us wear signs. 
 You should totally hit that. 
 The book is really disturbing. 
 If anything, it just sounds like your dad wasn't that creative. 
 But if that's the case, it's even creepier. 
 He talks about how he's planned his own death for years. 
 April's medical expenses are high. 
 And private school is a lot too. 
 You're making me leave Charton? 
 This is the last thing... 
 It's not fair. 
 (Phone beeping) 
 Brenna : Hey, Greer. I miss you too. 
 (Soft music playing) 
 Remember when we almost got kicked out of private school? 
 Well, now I actually did... 
 By my mom. 
 It was really awesome of her to force me to go to Charton against my will, wait until I was happy there and then force me to leave. 
 I had to quit my job at Alchemy 'cause it's too far from my new school. 
 But since April got sick, she always comes first, especially now that she's getting married. 
 There's, like, no way to compete with the cancer bride. 
 So I don't. 
 I just keep my dumb problems to myself and wait for graduation. 
 I know I sound really bitter, but it's because it's always been this way. 
 Ever since I was born, I've been living in April’s shadow. 
 And now that she's sick, I'm not even allowed to complain about it, 
 'cause that would make me the bitch. 
 'Morning, girls. 
 'Morning. 
 Hey, Bren, bet you're happy you don't have to wear that uniform anymore, huh? 
 What? You always hated it. 
 And you won't have to deal with that in public school. 
 Hey, listen, you want to go shopping this weekend? 
 Can we afford that? 
 Okay, I know you're upset, but trust me when I tell you some of the best things in life don't seem that appealing at first. 
 And then... 
 This is going very well, Sara. 
 You should definitely keep talking. 
 I'm trying to point out the bright side. 
 But... I'll just... I'll be quiet. 
 Emma : It hasn't happened in your lifetime, but I'm still holding out hope. 
 Hey. I'm sorry you're having a bad week. 
 And I hate that I had something to do with it. 
 It's okay. 
 Well, I want to tell you something that I hope might make you feel better. 
 So you know, I've had all of these big decisions to make lately. 
 So it was a huge relief that the decision about who to pick for my maid of honor was a no-brainer. 
 Brenna, I would be honored for you to be my maid of honor. 
 Will you? 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 ♪ You bet your soul, honey ♪ 
♪ you bet your soul ♪ 
♪ just right ♪ 
♪ you could stay all night ♪ 
♪ and never want to go home ♪ 
♪ 'cause we can't stop, won't stop. ♪ 
 Okay, Bren, I have all my wedding spreadsheets online, so I'm going to share those with you now. 
 (Yawning) Great. 
 You're going to love being a maid of honor. I did it three times. 
 Each time, I did a different reading by my favorite poet, e.e. Cummings. 
 Uh, April, would you be interested in a reading by my favorite poet, Nicki Minaj? 
 (All chuckle) 
 Uh, sure, grandma. 
 All right, first up are invitations. 
 Would you mind picking those up from the printing store? 
 And then I can help you stuff and stamp envelopes? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Um, I just... I have film club after school. 
 But I can run to the store first. 
 Those need to go out today? 
 Yes. 
 If you can. 
 Well, sorry, but the wedding is in a couple of weeks. 
 This is already a last-minute notice for your guests. 
 So... 
 Brenna : Okay. 
 Okay. Today it is. 
 Oh, and tomorrow at the bridal shop, will you help me pick out bridesmaid dresses for you, Beth and Natalie? 
 Totally, yeah. 
 Sara : I can't believe you don't already have a dress. 
 Leo : Knock knock! 
 We're going to need to find something that fits like a glove. 
 You guys home? 
 There's going to be no time for alterations. 
 It'll work out, mom. don't worry. 
 You know what, Sara? I've thought about it. 
 And I guess maybe April and I don't both need to be wearing gowns after all. Might save us some time. 
 Ahem. 
 Good morning, estrogen house. And how are we doing today? 
 Fine. 
 Outwardly pleasant, with tensions boiling just under the surface. 
 Ah. 
 Brenna is going to be my maid of honor. 
 Ooh. So sorry. 
 Ow. My tumor. 
 Nicholas : You're not entering the film festival? 
 But I was going to be the next Heath Ledger. 
 Dude, I was Heath. You were Jake. 
 I want to, but I can't unless I'm an active student here. 
 I just can't believe you're going to public school. 
 Yeah, you should probably start carrying a knife. 
 Hey, if you get all C's, you might be valedictorian. 
 Guys, this isn't helping. Public school isn't that bad. 
 Ford, you taught those kids how to knit at Roxbury. 
 That was public school, right? 
 Mm-hmm. It was really scary. 
 I'm so depressed you're leaving. 
 Alison Daly's skirt is stuck in her Spanx and it's bringing me no joy. 
 Hunter, make me laugh. 
 You haven't made any sexual jokes about your food, and it's pigs-in-a-blanket day. 
 Yeah, I don't know. It, like, too obvious or something. 
 It's like something they would joke about in public school. 
 Oh, Hunter. Pigs in a blanket. 
 Anything to say about that? 
 He can't even. It's Brenna's last day here tomorrow and we're all in mourning. 
 You're leaving Charton? 
 Yeah, my mom is pulling me out. 
 We have too many expenses and, of course, mine was cut first. 
 So I can't enter the film festival. 
 Why not? We have a couple more days. 
 Let's just get back into editing as soon as you're out of class. 
 Well, I have to run an errand for my sister first. 
 She picked me to be maid of honor. 
 I'm starting to understand why they call it a "maid." 
 Okay. Well, we have tomorrow too. 
 Tomorrow we're dress shopping, and that's my last day here. 
 So I only have today. 
 (Sighs) Oh, I can't do this. 
 Well, the hopelessness and self-doubt in your voice tells me one thing. 
 You're definitely a filmmaker. 
 Don't freak out, I've got you. 
 We'll get it done. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 "I've got you." (Gasps) 
 (Laughing) 
 They were supposed to be ready yesterday. 
 Sorry, this is my mom's store. She always takes longer than she says. 
 Mom! 
 Hey, it's just... 
 I have to leave, like, five minutes ago. 
 Mom, are they done? 
 We're going to miss all of film club. 
 You are seriously angsting. 
 Are you really this into filmmaking, or is it about your crush on the teacher? 
 She's not a teacher. 
 Ah, here they are. 
 "April Craver." 
 My sister's name is spelled wrong. 
 These have to be redone. 
 Ah, hang on. 
 Let me get my mom. Mom! 
 You know, I gotta go. I'll just... I'll come back. 
 Okay, but she can be kind of shady about doing reprints, so I'd talk to her if I were you. 
 Does your mom even exist? 
 Unfortunately. 
 Hang on a sec. Mom! 
 If those new clinical-trial drugs are fun, can I try some? 
 Mmm. 
 Sure, if you want to be a human guinea pig. 
 You know, I know I picked this trial, but it's so scary being a test subject. 
 These drugs are so new, the last phase was to make sure they didn't kill people. 
 Okay. Maybe I don't want to try 'em. 
 Exactly. At least this phase is to see if they can heal people. 
 Let's hope. I think it's great you're taking charge of your health like this. 
 My health, maybe. My career? Not so much. 
 But you? Yours is insane. 
 You're getting published again. 
 Yeah, I know. I feel pretty lucky. 
 I'm sure it was nice to get some good news after what happened with Natalie. 
 I heard. I'm sorry. 
 I guess it just wasn't meant to be. 
 You don't have to answer this if it's weird, but what happened with you two? 
 And it's weird. Okay. 
 Hey, you know who I heard from recently? 
 My mom. 
 Really? 
 She just got her real-estate license. 
 Oh! Go, Mariann. 
 You guys are in touch. That's awesome. 
 A little. She's been trying to get together, but, I don't know. 
 You should. She's a good person. 
 She just got into a bad situation. 
 It wasn't even about what she did. 
 I just can't stand being lied to. 
 I'm sorry. I was pretty harsh about that with you. 
 You didn't have to say that, but it still feels good to hear. 
 I'm sure your mom would agree. 
 I know. 
 It's just so awkward between us now. 
 Maybe you're just not ready for alone time yet. 
 Why don't we all go to lunch together? 
 I'd love to see her again. 
 While not high on a pot cookie. 
 (Both panting) 
 God! Is this what it feels like to exercise? 
 I'm sorry I just stopped by. 
 I needed to talk, and I knew no one at home would care. 
 I promise I care. I just also care about my abs. 
 Can't you just skip dress shopping tomorrow? 
 Bridesmaid dresses will be disgusting whether you're there or not. 
 I doubt it. 
 Now that April’s cancer is back, I'd be a jerk for even asking. 
 Oh, yeah, the cancer factor. 
 Right? 
 It's always terrible timing. 
 April's starting this clinical trial that may or may not save her life. 
 There's no way that my little movie is going to matter next to her wedding. 
 Mmm. 
 It's not easy being April Carver's sister. 
 Keep talking. 
 Let's just say, feel lucky you didn't share a boyfriend with her. 
 Ew. 
 Whatever happened with you and Dominic anyway? 
 It ended so quickly. 
 Um, well, long story short, he didn't want me as much as I wanted him, so I had to get out. 
 I'm over feeling unwanted. 
 Thanks, daddy issues. 
 Sorry. I shouldn't have said that to you. 
 No, it's okay. I'm glad that you tell me these things. 
 (Sighs) 
 Sara : Oh. 
 Um, I assumed that you were staying here tonight since we are dress shopping tomorrow, right? 
 Oh. I'll just meet you all there. 
 Okay. Well, you know, not to butt in or anything, but I don't love the thought of you being out in public by yourself while you're adjusting to your new meds. 
 (Door opens) 
 April, we just don't know if... ha! Hi, Leo. 
 I said the same thing. 
 Yeah. 
 He is even more paranoid about my health than you are. 
 So you don't have to worry. I'll be in good hands when we live together. 
 And when will that be? 
 Ideally, before the wedding, but we're not in a huge rush. 
 I mean, this all happened so quickly anyway. 
 Yeah, it did. 
 Oh, uh, Sara, I've been meaning to ask if you'd do me a favor... well, us a favor. 
 I know April would like to avoid public humiliation. 
 Um, I don't know how to dance. 
 Like, at all. 
 I was hoping to learn something simple so that we can have the whole first dance at the wedding. 
 Well, I'm afraid I don't know of any dance teachers off-hand, but... 
 Well, no, I was actually thinking you might teach me. 
 I heard you're pretty good. 
 (Laughs) I don't know about that. 
 I'm certainly not a teacher. 
 Well, I saw you at that tango class. 
 Maybe you could just teach him, like, a little box step or something? 
 Please? 
 Okay. 
 Can you come by tomorrow night? 
 Done, thank you. I really appreciate it. 
 Not as much as I do. 
 Okay. 
 Anyway, it feels so great to just... 
 To be back in the workforce. 
 You know? I got business cards and I got my face on a freakin' bench. 
 I mean, I've arrived. 
 Yeah, you have. 
 Yeah, mom. I'm proud of you. 
 Ah well, thanks, guys. That means a lot. 
 Anyway, I'm a little bit insecure today because I'm just about to show my first house. 
 So I hope I don't screw it up. 
 You won't. Just don't get in your head. 
 (Laughs) I never understood that advice. 
 I mean, how could I not be in my head? 
 That's where I live. It feels so great just to finally have some direction with my life again. 
 Ah, I miss that. 
 I've been feeling so aimless since being unemployed. 
 Oh, you're not working at the Post anymore? 
 No, I'm putting my career on the back burner for now. 
 Are you doing any writing just for yourself, though? 
 Yeah, yeah. I wrote a grocery list today. 
 Nice. 
 You should start writing again. 
 She wrote some personal stuff for the paper and it was really good. 
 Oh, I gotta get going. 
 Um, are you guys going to stay longer? 
 No, no, no, this is... this is on me. 
 Thank you. 
 So where are you heading off to, April? 
 I'm going wedding-dress shopping. 
 Ah. 
 Well, I would go with a white one. 
 (Laughs) 
 Thank you. 
 Sara : Is that what that is? 
 (All giggling) 
 Oh! 
 (Giggles) 
 I promised myself I wouldn't cry on the first dress. 
 I don't know. Is it me, though? 
 Are you entering a beauty pageant? 
 Yeah, I think we can do better. 
 This one has some design flaws, and that's all I can see. 
 All I can see are my port scars. 
 Excuse me, do you think you can find some dresses that would cover these? 
 Um, sure. 
 Let me see what I can find for you. 
 And more champagne. 
 Just keep it coming. 
 Sara : Hey, there you are. 
 You've got the invitations, right? 
 No, no I didn't. Because I was saying goodbye to my friends for maybe ever. 
 The ones I picked up yesterday were misspelled. 
 I'll get the reprints after this. 
 Cool. Well, thank you. 
 You guys ready to model some bridesmaid dresses? 
 Yeah. 
 You can try on ugly ones for fun. 
 That will not be hard to do here. 
 Okay, cool. Let's go. 
 Oh, mom? I think that they have some dresses for you and grandma in the... 
 In the old ladies' section. 
 I believe they call it the "legacy collection." 
 Great. Even worse. 
 (Laughs) 
 (All moaning)

 I am so not getting laid at this wedding. 
 Wow, how will April choose? 
 How am I going to walk down the aisle? 
 No, no, no. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Ah, fine, Bridezilla. 
 I'm gonna go check on the legacies. 
 I'm trying on another one. 
 I'm ready for another too, but I think my port scared the salesgirl. 
 She never came back. 
 I'm sure she just forgot. 
 Um, hold on. 
 Hi. Um, excuse me, can you help my sister? 
 Of course. 
 That dress looks gorgeous on you. 
 Maybe not with that scarf, though. 
 Let's try a veil. 
 I don't... I don't think I can wear that. 
 Oh, right. 
 Um, let me see what we have in the back. 
 Maybe a hat or... 
 Okay, she sucks. 
 Um, let me... let me try to find someone else. It might take a minute, though. 'Cause I can't walk. 
 (Laughs) 
 Um, excuse me. 
 Oh, uh... 
 Sorry. Uh, never... never mind. 
 
 
 
 (Grunts) 
 You okay, sweetie? 
 Yeah. 
 I know what you're thinking. Just open your mind to the two-piece. 
 No, Natalie. Jake Cohen is here. 
 You know, the guy. 
 The guy who got me pregnant. 
 It was bad enough seeing his photos in the Charton trophy case every day. 
 No, Natalie, please. 
 Hey! I know what you did, you little punk. 
 Whoa. What the hell? 
 You better make sure he wears a condom. 
 Jake, what is she talking about? 
 Get him, Natalie! 
 Mom. Who is that? 
 I don't know. I just like fights. 
 Guys, what's going on? 
 Um, nothing. don't worry about it. 
 Bren, are you okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. 
 I just, um... I'm gonna go change and I have to go pick up the invitations 'cause the store is going to close, so... 
 Hey. 
 Hey, now that we're alone, could you tell me what happened over there? 
 That was the guy. 
 Oh. 
 The guy who... 
 Yeah. Knocked her up and paid her hush money to get an abortion. 
 What? When did that happen? 
 Two years ago. She didn't tell you? 
 No. 
 But she told you? 
 God, you don't have to say it all judgey like that. 
 Are we doing okay back here? 
 No, we're not doing okay. 
 Actually, weren't you the one that was helping me before? 
 Um, maybe. 
 It was you, yeah. 
 I'm sorry. It got really busy. 
 What? Are you afraid of me because I have cancer? 
 You know it's not contagious or anything. 
 You don't have to avoid me. 
 And you know who else had cancer? 
 My fiance, Leo Hendrie. 
 Yeah. It's a shame I'm going to have to take my business elsewhere, 
 'cause he told me I could have whatever I wanted. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 I still can't believe that you raged at those chicks at the bridal store. 
 It was so pretty woman, minus the being-a-hooker part, plus cancer. 
 Plus a little sister who hides major secrets from me. 
 I still think it's just so sad she felt like she had to go through that all by herself, you know? 
 I know. And I get why she wouldn't want to tell mom or grandma, but she didn't tell her sister? Her full one. 
 Look, I know that you're upset she told Natalie and not you, but it kind of makes sense if you think about it. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, you know, Natalie is sort of a mess herself. 
 She's not going to judge Brenna for anything. 
 I wouldn't have either. I wouldn't have! 
 All right, all right. Look, all I'm saying is, Natalie is more of a buddy to Brenna, and you're more of a mother... well, like a... 
 You're... well, you're more of a... 
 Well... 
 You were going to say "mother." 
 Uh... yeah. 
 Did you want a reaction shot from Hunter there? 
 Uh, no. No, I don't need it. 
 He looks kind of constipated in all of them. 
 (Giggles) 
 Hey, I didn't mean to blow you off or anything yesterday. 
 I mean, I kind of felt like you did. 
 You didn't even tell me you weren't coming. 
 Well, you wanted a song here right? 
 How's this? 
 ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ♪ 
 Oh, man. Ford's going to hate this. 
 So you love it? 
 Yeah. 
 Anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time. 
 It's just that being maid of honor is taking over my life right now. 
 And I can't really say no to April these days. 
 (Phone buzzes) 
 Mmm. And there's a person I can't say no to. 
 Who's that? 
 My ex. 
 We've been broken up for a couple months, but we're still friends, mostly because she's an alcoholic and I just worry about her. 
 And I know it's not the same as cancer, but... 
 I mean, they're both diseases. 
 I know it's complicated to stay friends with her, but it feels messed up to cut her off. 
 Okay, so that was the last note. 
 That's it? 
 Yeah, except titles. But we can do that tomorrow. 
 Um, tomorrow is Saturday. 
 Whatever. It won't take that long. 
 And then I'll officially be done at Charton. 
 I know. 
 But, hey, at least it won't be weird when we hang out because I'm your adviser. 
 Mmm, ahem. 
 Sorry. Uh, sorry. 
 Um, I just... I thought because you said that we could hang out... 
 I... I meant as friends. I'm sorry. 
 But I'm just... I'm not interested in you like that. 
 It's okay, you don't... 
 Just trust me, it's better to be with someone your own age. 
 Right now, you're trying to figure out who you are and there's so much you don't know. 
 I mean, you don't even know what you don't know. 
 And that probably doesn't make sense to you right now. 
 But... 
 No, I get it. I get it. 
 I'm just... I'm gonna head out. 
 Okay. I'll see you tomorrow? 
 Thank you for keeping me fed all day. 
 How is your ravioli always so good? 
 Well, you know what I do? I take a bit of the pasta water and then I put it in the sauce. 
 I mean, it makes a huge difference. 
 So the... the open house went well? 
 Yes. I think I'm going to get an offer. 
 No, I'm serious. 
 I was so good. You should have seen me. 
 Do you want to hear some of my spiel? 
 Yeah, go for it. 
 Okay. 
 "If you're looking for a great home, look no further. Now this place may be a bit of a project, but it's got great bones." 
 That means it's well-built, with a solid roof and a good foundation. 
 "It's the perfect fixer-upper for a family's first home. It's got tons of available light. It's spacious with architectural details to die for... " 
 I don't know. I can't remember what else I said. 
 I was high on adrenaline. 
 That was great, though. I'm tempted to buy the house myself. 
 Well, you should buy a house like that. 
 I mean, now with your second book coming out, you can afford not to have a roommate. 
 Yeah, but Graham is never here anyway. 
 I mostly have the place to myself. 
 I don't need to move into a bigger place. 
 Well, with a face like yours, you won't be single for very long. 
 So are you... are dating anyone? 
 Uh, no. I just... I kind of stopped seeing someone. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 What happened? 
 Uh, according to her, I'm still in love with April. 
 Does she know April. Why would she say that? 
 She's her half-sister. 
 Oh, I see. 
 Yeah. 
 So I guess you have a type. 
 It's not true, though. April and I are just friends. 
 And it's not like she's available anyway. 
 Right. 
 One, two, three... 
 One... oh! 
 (Emma laughs) 
 Okay, Leo. 
 I... 
 It's all right. 
 Remember... one, two, three. One, two... 
 Right, sorry. Okay. 
 One, two, three, one, two, three... 
 Yep. Oh! 
 (Emma laughing) 
 God, I'm sorry. 
 Mom, it's not funny. 
 Well, let's agree to disagree. 
 So, wait, hold on. Is it my right foot forward, your left foot back? 
 Wait, I think... isn't it the other way around? 
 I, um... I don't know. 
 This is confusing. Let me... 
 Let me try leading April for a second. 
 Here, you sit down. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, you ready? 
 Okay. Mm-hmm. 
 One, two, three... 
 Well, this isn't as much fun now. 
 I'm going out with Sam. 
 Don't wait up for me. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 One, two, three... 
 Ooh! 
 Sara : Oh, Brenna. 
 I can take those invites off your hands if you want. 
 I'm going to be going to the post office tomorrow morning anyway. 
 I left them at Charton. 
 What? Why were you even there? 
 I know I screwed up. Okay? 
 Big shocker. And I know that nobody cares, but I've had a really bad week. 
 And I seriously can't handle a lecture right now. 
 I'm going to Natalie’s. 
 You can stay here as long as you want. 
 There's plenty of room. 
 Beth's been working crazy hours. 
 That explains why I'm maid of honor by default. 
 Ugh! This is why I hate weddings. 
 So much unnecessary drama. 
 I like the Oprah-and-Stedman model. 
 They choose to be together every single day. 
 There's no contract telling them they have to be. 
 That's really romantic of you. 
 I have my moments. 
 (Door opens) 
 Whoa, Beth’s home early. 
 Oh, April. 
 Hey. 
 Are you here to fire me as maid of honor? 
 No. Look, I know mom's been stressing out about the wedding, but none of that is coming from me. 
 I reserve my tantrums for the staff at Whiter Shade of Veil. 
 What? 
 Oh, yeah. Girl lost it on the sales bitches. 
 True story. 
 (Laughs) I can't believe I missed that. 
 I'm sorry about the invitations. 
 I'll get them on Monday. 
 God, it's going to suck going back to Charton. 
 I already said goodbye to everyone and everything. 
 Well, if you don't want to go on Monday, let's go tonight. 
 The school is closed. 
 So? We can find a way in. 
 I mean, sure. 
 What are they going to do, expel me? 
 Exactly. Let's go. 
 You want to come? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 There's no way I'm missing this. 
 Welcome to the family. 
 Thanks, yeah. 
 I feel like one of the girls now. 
 Sorry you had to witness that. 
 We didn't even get to figure out your dance. 
 That's all right. That's what YouTube is for. 
 All right, I'll get going. 
 So, I don't... is April staying with you tonight or is she coming home? 
 I... sorry, I guess I... I shouldn't say "home." 
 Home is with you now. 
 Well, I think she is staying with me, but I have no idea how to cook, so she'll always end up back here. 
 (Chuckles) 
 I guess I'm just used to being the one taking care of her. 
 Well, you don't have to stop. 
 There's room for both of us. 
 The girl loves attention. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Should we give your box step one more try before you leave? 
 Sure, yeah. 
 I'll... I'll start us off. 
 Okay. We're going back. 
 Back, right. Okay. 
 (Laughs) 
 Ready? 
 One, two, three, one, two, three... 
 One... ha! It's happening. 
 Don't jinx us now. 
 (Laughs) 
 See? You just got to let someone else take the lead sometimes. 
 (Humming) 
 Janitor dude's got a nice ass. 
 (Whispering) What? Natalie, focus. 
 When he goes back inside, you need to follow him. 
 Are you... are you watching? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Can't take my eyes off that thing. 
 Go, go, go. 
 Yeah. No, no, no, I understand. 
 We'll keep looking. 
 Talk soon. 
 (Sighs) 
 The house didn't sell. 
 Damn. 
 Yeah. That's a bit of a bummer. 
 Oh, well. 
 I'm still proud as hell of myself. 
 And the good news is, I got to spend all day with my son. 
 (Laughs) 
 I can't remember the last time we spent this much time together. 
 I miss that. 
 I do too. 
 You know we're okay now, right? 
 Well, I hope so. 
 You know, these last couple of years have been hard. 
 But there were so many good years before that. 
 I know it wasn't easy for you to raise us on your own. 
 I didn't give you enough credit for that. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, I guess you can thank your dad for teaching you how not to behave when you get married. 
 Yeah, if that ever happens. 
 What are you talking about? Of course you're going to get married. 
 And when you do, I want you to look at her the way you look at April. 
 Mom, come on, we're just friends. 
 "We're just friends." 
 I know, I know. (Laughs) 
 Well, you're supposed to be friends with the person you marry, right? 
 Remember, you don't have to wait to meet her to go for the things you want in life. 
 (Whispering) Where are the invitations? 
 End of the hall. 
 Isn't that him? 
 Yeah. 
 (Door opens) 
 (Man talking) 
 Better be the hot janitor. 
 (Second man talking) 
 (Keys jangling, door opens) 
 Oh, my God. We did it! 
 I told you it would work out. 
 Yeah, thanks to Natalie. You were so fast back there. 
 I just imagined Beckham on the other side of that door. 
 (Both laughing) 
 Ah! 
 Didn't know it was a favorite-sister contest. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing. I just feel out of the loop with you two sometimes. 
 April. 
 You're the one who asked me to take care of Brenna while you were in the hospital. 
 Did you not want us to be close? 
 You asked her to take care of me? 
 Why? 
 Or is this like when you said you were okay with me dating Dominic as long as no real feelings were involved? - Oh, my God. 
 You guys breaking up had nothing to do with me. 
 Everything has to do with you. 
 What? 
 Brenna, why would you say that? 
 Never mind. Let's just go home. 
 (Alarm beeps) 
 What was that? 
 It's the alarm. 
 (Beeping) 
 (Beeps, door latches) 
 We're stuck here. 
 Come on. 
 What if we're stuck here all weekend? 
 Brenna : We won't be. 
 Trust me. I've had Saturday detention before. 
 Are you sure? 'Cause I don't have my meds or a phone charger. What if... 
 April! 
 I get it! You're sick. 
 We know! 
 Whoa. 
 That's why I feel like I can't tell you anything, because no matter what I'm going through, you're going through something worse. 
 So what? 
 You can still tell me your problems. 
 Why? So you can try to fix me, like you always do. 
 I don't try to fix you. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 When dad died, you moved back home to take care of us. 
 When I started getting into trouble after that, you helped mom find Charton. 
 When mom pulled me out of honor, you asked me to be your maid of honor. 
 I thought you'd like that. 
 I do, but... 
 Sometimes I just want you to listen like Natalie does. 
 You know, I didn't realize asking you to watch out for Brenna meant keeping huge secrets from me. 
 What huge secrets? 
 I'm sorry. I thought she already knew about Jake. 
 Oh, that's great. 
 Does mom know now? 
 No! I wouldn't tell... 
 Natalie, why did you tell her that? 
 Are you happy, April? Now she hates both of us. 
 Well, in the spirit of not keeping secrets, here's another one... 
 I found dad's unpublished manuscript. 
 What? Where? 
 In storage. 
 It's supposed to be fiction, but the characters are us. 
 Cliff's notes version... 
 I'm simple, Brenna is a band-aid on a broken marriage, April is the golden child. 
 You guys, our dad is the worst. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I didn't even know he was writing another book. 
 Yeah, well, there's a lot of things you don't know about him. 
 Hello. 
 Okay, look, I don't want to keep secrets from each other like dad did. 
 What was going on with you this week that you felt you couldn't tell me? 
 Nothing. I was just going to try to enter this stupid film festival, and I couldn't get it done on top of being maid of honor. 
 It's fine. 
 No, I know how important that was for you. 
 Is there any way you can still make the deadline? 
 Well, now I don't know if I want to. 
 Okay, now that we're just putting it all out there, something else happened today. 
 I came back here to try to finish the movie with my film adviser Margo. 
 I tried to kiss her. 
 Don't worry. She totally rejected me. 
 I've literally never been so humiliated. 
 So that's the real reason I didn't want to come back to Charton. 
 She offered to meet me here tomorrow, but I'd rather just skip the whole festival than see her again. 
 Now we can just sneak out in the morning before she gets here. 
 Been there. 
 Yep. 
 Who was yours, April? 
 Um, a college T.A. 
 (Both laugh) 
 You? 
 Babysitter. 
 (All laughing) 
 Okay, who wants to slide around the halls like we're in Breakfast Club? 
 Oh, my God. Sometimes I hate being the oldest. 
 (Keys jangling) 
 (Students chattering) 
 You guys, somebody's here. We have to get up. 
 Natalie : Let's get out of here. 
 I don't let anybody see me with my hair like this. 
 Perks of not having much. 
 Hey. You're here early with, um, people. 
 Yeah, sorry. It's a long story. 
 Um, Margo, these are my sisters April and Natalie. 
 Um, I'm going to head home, Bren. 
 Are you coming with? 
 Um, I... I think I'm going to stay here and finish the movie. 
 See you guys later. 
 Yeah. 
 There you are. 
 I was getting worried about you. 
 Sorry. My phone died. 
 Where's Brenna? 
 Oh, she's fine. 
 She just had a few things she needed to take care of today, but she'll be home later. 
 Any interest in helping me address the invitations? 
 Well, I thought these were at the... 
 Do not worry about it. (Chuckles) 
 What do you think? 
 I like them. 
 I thought about what you said. 
 Brenna, I'm sorry if I... 
 No, I... I get it. 
 I get that there's a lot that I don't know yet because I'm young. 
 But I know more than you think. 
 I've been through a lot these last few years. 
 You already know about April, but, um, I also lost my dad. 
 And I found out that he had a secret family. 
 And I met my new sister. 
 And I donated stem cells to a stranger. 
 Even though yesterday was really embarrassing, and I'm very uncomfortable right now, I know that I've been through way worse and I'll be fine. 
 And I can take this from here too if you don't want to be here on a weekend. 
 (Knocking) 
 Is that dad's book? 
 Yeah. I got it from Natalie. 
 Are you going to tell mom about it? 
 I don't know. I have to read it first. 
 And then you'll decide? 
 And then we'll decide. 
 (Typing) 
 Who did Jake Cohen piss off?
