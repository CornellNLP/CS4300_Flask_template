 Previously on "Chasing Life"... 
 Thomas Carver? Like the novelist? 
 Dad? 
 Yeah. 
 Who's Natalie Ortiz? 
 I fell asleep on the T last night. 
 1 a.m., end of the line, miss. 
 I'll write you a prescription to prevent infection. 
 Surprise! 
 So you play tennis? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 Why are you laughing, loser? 
 Because I'm a lesbian I'm supposed to be all angry like you? 
 I don't know. 
 April : You are supposed to be with Mom at tango! 
 Okay, I'm wrong. 
 What else is new? 
 I have cancer! 
 (Both laugh) 
 Yes, heads, I win! 
 Flip again. 
 Come on, you're such a sore loser. 
 Why don't you wanna do this? 
 Because psychics are a total scam. 
 I know. It'll be hilarious. Come on. 
 No. Just one more time. If it's heads, I'll go in. 
 Heads again. 
 My God. 
 Come on, it's a sign. 
 I don't believe in signs. 
 It's a sign. 
 I don't believe in signs. 
 Are you scared she'll tell you when you're gonna die or something? 
 No, I... I mean... 
 Kind of... 
 Oh! Look at you! 
 (Chuckles) 
 Well, you look like models. 
 Well, sit down, sit down. There's no runway here. 
 You sore? Lucky girl. 
  (Laughs) 
 Hmm. Okay, come on, come on. Come, come, come. Oh... oh. Intelligent, passionate, you take good care of yourself. Nice nails. Wicked number of girlfriends before you. You can tell that from his hand? Nah, from his face. He's gorgeous. Oh, you didn't tell me you were taking me to see your mom. Oh, there is something about your mother here. She move or something? Move? Uh, no. Ha, you got issues with your mom, but you're very close to your brothers. I'm an only child. Meh. Uh, actually, I'm good. Oh, no, no. No. You're not. You're tired. Now you sound like my mother. Ah, oh, your future's real messed up,  but... but it's okay. It's okay. You can fix it. You want a healthy future? You got to dig into your past. Go talk to your sisters. I only have one sister. Oh, well, talk to her then. Trust me, it's crucial. Well, at least she got one thing right. You have a sister. Yeah, I'm so glad I paid her 30 bucks to tell me that. I paid her 30 bucks. Then the joke's on you. You know there are children, like, starving everywhere. Maybe one of them's your sister. Did you check in with her, yet? Because it's crucial. While I do that, you should probably go deal with your mommy issues. ♪ You bet your soul, honey ♪ 
♪ you bet your soul ♪ 
♪ just right ♪ 
♪ you could stay all night and never wanna go home ♪ 
♪ 'cause we can't stop ♪ Thomas :  Who's ready for breakfast? Brenna :  I am. Ooh, dad, you burnt those. I just do that to remind you girls I'm human. (Laughs) Oh, don't worry, sweetheart. I think we figured that out the last time you put your belt in the washing machine. I'm an artist. We don't read instructions. We like to think outside the box. Really? Is that why you wear your sunglasses around your neck? You bought these for me. As a joke. Well, the joke is on you. I like these. You started without me. Time and hunger wait for no one. You guys, Katie just emailed me. And she can't move into the apartment for another two months now. I mean, what am I supposed to do about rent money? My internship barely pays enough for my Metro card. Hey, winter's over. We'll just get you a sleeping bag. Dad, seriously. I'm stressing out. I know. I'm trying to reassure you. There are plenty of places to stay in New York that don't require rent: Central park, steps of the MET, ooh, ooh, that 24-hour bodega on 71st St. Honey, we can help you out for a couple months. Ape, you're gonna be fine. Just remember what I always say. What? April, honey, are you okay? I'm fine. What, dad? April?! Sara : April, can you hear me? April? Honey, get her some water? Sweetheart... Are you okay? What happened? Have a bite of your toast. I think you just fainted. Do you remember feeling light-headed? I... I don't think I ate enough last night, and I didn't drink enough water. And I had way too much coffee. Honey, you know what this means. Yeah, time and hunger wait for no woman. It means you're pushing yourself too hard. I want you to stay home today. Mom, I'm fine. It will not kill you to miss a day. Please don't make this a big deal. I'm not making this a big deal. Your body is telling you to slow down. So I will move slower. See? All better. What's wrong? Can you check the bandage? I want to see how it's healing. It looks okay, I think. Oh, thank you. What about you? Are you okay? You're the one who's sick. But you looked pretty freaked out back there. When I walked in the kitchen, it looked like you were... Oh, Brenna. I'm gonna be fine. When can we tell mom? Soon, I should get the results from the test today or tomorrow. And if it's a good prognosis, which I'm sure it will be, I'll lead with that. I just don't want to worry mom more than we have to. Sara :  Mom, April fainted. When? Is she all right? Just now... yeah, no. She says she's fine. But, I don't know, something's wrong. She's tired all the time. She's lost weight. She's been so moody. Well, she's been working a lot lately. Well, the other day, I walked into her room. And I saw her sticking something in her drawer like she was trying to hide it from me. Did you look in the drawer? No! I don't... I don't snoop on my daughters. It's your right as a mother. Just go through all her stuff. I did it when you were her age. You did? Nice bong, by the way. I bet you always wondered where it went. I can't believe you went to a psychic without me, bitch. So what did she say? Oh, just a bunch of generic stuff that applies to everyone, like... (Brooklyn accent) You need to heal your past. (Both giggle) She did say that I should talk to my sister, though. So I checked in with Brenna just in case. Yeah, how is she? I mean, she says she's fine, but... But she's not gonna tell you the truth. You know, I bet she'd tell me, though. I mean, we are the only two members of April's "secret cancer club." I'll call a meeting. The psychic actually said I should talk to my "sisters." What if she meant, like, my secret sister? The fact that you're even asking that question, means you're curious about it. All I know is her name... Natalie Ortiz... And I wish I didn't even know that. Why are you so scared to know more about this girl? Honestly, it's not her I'm scared to know more about. (Chattering) Hey. You remember that name you got off a license plate last week without my permission? Natalie Ortiz: 22BH38? How do you do that? Harvard. I need to know everything you found out about her. Intriguing. I'll help for a price. I'm broke. Please, I don't care about money. I want an additional reporting bi-credit. Fine, deal. Natalie Ortiz rented the car at Logan on April 12th, Provident car rentals. (Mutters) Okay. That's it, but I'll dig for more if you tell Raquel that you and I hooked up once and I was awesome. Uh, no, as tempting as that is. Really, I think I got it from here. ♪ Hey, where're you heading? Uh, out. I'm just doing some research. You got a second to talk? S... s... sure. Are you okay? Yeah. I just want us to be honest with each other, you know? Unload whatever baggage that we have. Okay. So you know when the psychic said that I had mom issues? Yeah, that was crazy. I mean, who doesn't have mom issues? Or dad issues? I know, but... mine are pretty major. I felt like it was too soon to tell you this before, but... My mom's in prison. Shut up. Seriously. Oh, really? That's funny, actually. Because I've been meaning to tell you that my grandma's a stripper. I'm sorry. I really thought you were joking. It's... Um... It's fine. I know it sounds ridiculous. What is she in for? She was a bookkeeper for this guy who embezzled money. She went along with it, so she's in for a year. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. You think that's baggage? I'll show you baggage. (Laughs) How are we the only girls at school who realize topknots are lame? It's like... I'm sorry, but you look like a sumo wrestler. What's wrong with you? Topknots are usually your favorite topic. I just had a really sucky morning. Oh my God, me too. I tuned in to this radio show like right after they called this guy. They were like you can send a dozen roses to the woman of your choosing. Guess who he chose. His girlfriend's  mom,  like they are dating. I'm so mad I missed it. Oh my God, Greer Danville is heading over here. And she's wearing a topknot. Hi, Brenna. Hey. When I get this thing off, I totally want a rematch. Yeah, maybe. (Bell rings) Or not. Um, what was that about? Um, tennis. I hustled her ass so that she would do our history homework for us. Nice, beat 'em at their own games. Sweet. Next. Okay, so which baggage is heavier? Secret sister or mom in prison? Hmm... Right now, mom in prison, but that's only because we know it's true. If we find out this girl is definitely my sister, then I win. And by win, I mean lose in life. I feel like a spy right now. A real spy would never say that. Oh, you're right. A real spy would just get into character. Isn't that right, my beautiful wife?  Next. Lose the smiles. Spies don't smile. Hi, my name is Natalie Ortiz. And my purse got stolen yesterday. I lost my IDs and my credit cards and the receipt for a car that I rented from you guys a few weeks ago. And my work won't reimburse me without it. So I was really hoping maybe you could just give me... Fill this out. We will mail you the receipt in five to seven business days. Next. Oh my g... Natalie, are you okay? Yeah. I'm worried about the baby. Let's see the doctor. Oh, we can't afford it until I get reimbursed. I just... (Gasps) It's okay. Just a few more days. You said five to seven, right? (Groans) When did you rent the car, Ms. Ortiz? April 12th. Tell you what. I'll give you the information if you promise you'll go see a doctor right away. Oh, I will. Thank you so much. You're way too good of a liar. What? Natalie lives in Key Largo, on the same street as my dad's writing retreat. Is there any world where it's a coincidence? I hope so. She's two years younger than me. If she is my dad's daughter, then he definitely cheated on my mom. So what exactly are we looking for? I don't know. Any proof that this girl really knew my dad. You really think your dad would have just left it with his stuff for anyone to find? I don't know. I mean, this is all the stuff from his Florida house. When he died, we just had it shipped here. What's that? His research notebook. He started a new one every time he wrote a new book. And this is from his last one. And his last trip. (Chuckles) Oh. Is this you? (Laughs) What? It was an awkward phase. That's so cute. Definitely like you better with long hair. Well... I sometimes like to go short. (Both laugh) Oh my God. Is that... It's Natalie... with my dad. And my uncle George. I just can't believe he pretended to be this great dad. Who was he? Yeah, of course you knew him. A person can have secrets and still be the same person you think they are. I mean, look at me. I'm the same person I was before I told you about my mom. Now what can I do to help? Nothing. I just... I need to talk to the only person I can  right now. My uncle.  (Phone beeps) What? Danny just sent me this. Dominic :  What's Danny doing with that woman? That woman is my mom. And what's she doing at my desk? Okay, you're either seriously considering getting a "YOLO" tattoo or you're upset about something. I'm sorry. I just found out something pretty big and I can't stop thinking about it. What is it? My sister has leukemia. April? But she's so young. I'm sorry, but there has to be something in our environment that's causing this. I don't know whether it's cellphones, preservatives, or what. But something's changing our DNA. You know? Like as a society. All I know is she's sick. I'm sorry. There's just... There's no way the government isn't aware of this. Beth :  Hey. Beth, hi. I am loving the eyeball theme in here. Oh, thanks. That was my idea. This is Kieran. Beth is my sister's friend. And yours. That's why I'm here. I thought we could talk about that thing that your sister told us that we're both dealing with. It's okay. Don't really need to talk about it. He knows, by the way. Oh. Okay. Well, look, my plan B if you didn't want to talk about it was to help you get your mind off it. There's an outdoor screening of "Pretty in Pink" tonight. Oh, God. You don't even know what that is, do you? I'm so old. No, unfortunately I do know what that is. It's my mom's favorite. Clearly your mother must be someone of impeccable taste. Come on, you can both come and you know what? If you don't love the movie, I will let you give me the tattoo of your choice on my face. I must really like you. (Chuckles) Yay. I thought if I called, you would just tell me you were too busy to see me. What's going on? Well, we have to talk. And I want to start by saying that I love you and I'm here for you. Okay. Now you're freaking me out. I was cleaning your room today and I found these. You haven't seemed like yourself lately. You fainted. You're tired all the time. I mean, what are they? They're just these supplements that help keep me going. I've been working really hard. You know that. I do, but I've got clients who've gotten addicted to pills because they are so desperately trying to keep going. I'd hate to see that happen to you. What, you think I'm like addicted? I'm not. Then prove it. Stop taking them. Mom, you don't understand. Explain it to me. Everyone expects me to be a certain way. And it's not that easy to take care of everything all the time. I'm not like superhuman. Honey, I want to help. I know, but I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me. DJ :  Attention duckies and duckettes, grab your seats and lower your hair because tonight's presentation of "Pretty in Pink" will begin when the sun goes down. Are you like in hell right now? No. I may lose a testicle just by being here, but I am happy to report that I do have another one. Mm. (Chuckles) So what did I miss? Who else sucks? What else would we rather be doing? No, we're having a good time. Yeah, it's actually very interesting from a sociological point of view. Just so long as it's not actually fun, 'cause fun would be so 2005. Kieran :  Oh, look. There's Martina Navratilova. Oh, don't tell me you just said that because she's a lesbian who plays tennis? Okay, I won't. Beth :  Martina would never wear an outfit like that. Your outfit's awesome. 
 
 Hey. Hi. So you guys go to school together? And we play tennis sometimes. Beth : Why don't you sit with us? I mean, maybe if you're here, I'll have someone to actually enjoy the movie with and they won't try to do inappropriate things under the blanket. Oh, yeah, I saw what was going on before. I'm Australian, not blind. I'm kind of with a big group. Hey, come sit with us. We have better seats. Okay, I've got a game we can play when the movie starts. Every time Blaine says the word... No. But I haven't even said... No. It could be a lot of fun... No. So what are your friends gonna think if they see me sitting with you? Isn't that gonna ruin your cred? I'm not too worried about it. My friends are way too cool to come to something like this, so... (Both chuckle) April? The biopsy results haven't come back yet, but we can discuss your options? I don't want to talk about that. But on the phone you said you had some questions? Actually I just have one. Okay. Who is Natalie Ortiz? April... She's my sister, isn't she? Yes. And she's younger than me, so my dad cheated on my mom. This was not an ongoing thing. Was he in love with her? He met her in Florida. He was working... It was so long ago. The affair may have been so long ago, but he lied my whole life. He just didn't want to hurt you guys. You know, he wanted to protect you. He was just trying to protect himself. And you protected him. I didn't agree that he should keep this a secret. Just like I don't think you should be keeping your illness from your mother now. Don't turn this around. April, I'm sorry. Maybe I should have told you. It's too late, George. Like years too late. (Crying) (Both sigh) Thanks for making it out tonight. Be sure to come back next week for "The Cutting Edge." 'Toe-pick.' So Mark just texted me. Everyone's going to his place to go watch that show that goes behind-the-scenes in the slaughterhouse. Uh, no, sorry. I draw the line at slaughterhouses. Brenna you're coming with me, okay? We need girl time. I'll call you after? All right. Beth, thanks for the movie.K Next time I'll make sure it's in black and white. Like life, Beth. Like life. Bren. Goodnight, Greer. I think my friends are leaving. Thanks for letting me watch the movie with you guys. I'm so glad I wasn't the only one that knew every line. I know, right? Have I mentioned how much I love your dress? A few times. Right. What about you? You like my dress? This may come as a surprise to you, but dresses aren't exactly my thing. Aw, come on. You'd look pretty in pink. (Chuckles) Fine. I'll see you at school? Yeah. Maybe this time we can actually say hi to each other. (Sighs) Sara. Hello, George. (Chuckles) What are you doing here? Well, I hate to say I followed April here, but I did. We have to talk. About April? You know anything about these pills? Answer me. Yeah, let me just get my bearings here. So you barge into my office after not speaking to me for two years, and now you're accusing me of... Well, I don't even know what you're accusing me of. You're right. No one's seen you in two years, and now all of a sudden I found out my daughter is coming to see you at the same time  her life is falling apart. I just can't help but think that's more than a coincidence. Why was she here? She's been coming to me for advice. About what? It's not my place to say. Sorry. But I've said all I can. If you want to find out any more about April, I suggest you talk to her. I've tried. She's not telling me anything. I have a right to know what's going on with her. I'm her mother. Just... Please tell me what is happening with her. I can't... I can't do this by myself. I've tried. And I... I can't. You know, for someone who considers herself an outsider, it must be nice to have everyone liking you. You know, Kieran and Greer. Greer? Yeah, it seems like she's into you. Whatever. We're just friends. It's not like we would ever date or anything. Why, 'cause of Kieran? 'Cause you're straight? No. Kieran and I aren't like exclusive. And I don't define myself. We're just so different. We're in like totally different friend groups. Wait, didn't we just watch a whole movie about how that stuff doesn't matter? I mean, come on. She's funny, she makes you laugh. And right now with everything that's going on, that doesn't seem like such a bad thing. You seem to be handling everything really well, by the way. Not really. I'm a really bad sister. Why would you say that? When I first noticed April acting weird and kind of losing it, I was basically happy about it. I mean, she's so perfect all the time. And it was like finally for a minute she had problems. And then I found out why. And I feel like the worst person in the world. Don't be so hard on yourself. I mean, that whole miss perfect thing is super annoying. (Chuckles) Yeah. I mean, have you seen how many categories she has in her email inbox? It's ridiculous. I once saw her flagging one of my messages as personal. She's so weird. I know, right? Did you know she keeps her socks organized by colour? I actually did know that. Hey, Sara. Is April home yet? Um, no. No, not yet. Is everything okay? Uh, sorry, Beth. This is a family matter. You'll have to visit with April another time. Oh, yeah. Okay. (Sighs) Conductor : Charles MGH Station. Charles MGH Station. I'm home. George? What's going on? I've called a family meeting. Why? April, we're here for you. What do you mean? This is an intervention. It's time. Either you tell them or I will. We love you very much, and we want to get you the help you need for your addiction. April, tell her. Tell me what? It's not what you think. I'm not addicted to drugs. (Sighs) I have leukemia. What? I have leukemia, mom. I don't... I'm... Are you sure? How is that possible? Oh my God. This isn't... This is a nightmare. Don't worry. Uncle George caught it early and I'm probably gonna be fine. We're just waiting for the results  from my bone marrow biopsy, and then we'll know exactly what we're dealing with. Honey... You've had to go through this by yourself? I told Beth. And me. I just didn't want to stress everyone out before we knew exactly what this was. I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, grandma. Don't worry about me, sweetheart. Or me, honey. I'm... I just want to be here for you. Mom, mom. (Crying) Oh, mom. Oh, God. I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... I just need a minute to... Come on, Ape. Okay. Let's get some tea. I want you to know that you're gonna be okay. Grandma. No, I mean it. I'd bet my life savings on it. Well, I realize that's an empty promise given that I have a slight gambling problem. (Chuckles) Seriously. There's no damn way I'm letting you die before I do. (Cellphone beeps) (Beeps) (Cellphone rings) This is Dr. Carver. Mm-hmm. (Sighs) I love you so much. This family's been through a lot together, and we're good in a crisis. We'll get through this. Okay, we're just gonna figure out the best course of treatment for you and we're gonna get right on it. Well, we need the test results first. Right, George? Actually, this was the lab. Well? The form of leukemia you have is called "AML." Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Is that a curable kind? It's treatable. This form of leukemia goes into remission about 75% of the time. So is this good news or bad news? Remission isn't a cure. It's serious. Sara :  Okay. How soon can she start? Well, ideally tomorrow. I just have to make calls... Can we check her in tonight? Well, the procedure begins with a full week of chemo. That's in-patient, right? Wait. Wait, listen to me. How debilitating is this gonna be? Just wait! Listen to me. Stop using words like "procedure" and "debilitating." I'm not going to the hospital tonight. When are you gonna start treatment? I don't know. But I need to figure this out. I have to do it. You're not thinking clearly. Wait a second. I'm sorry, but as your mother I can't... I can't breathe. I have to get out of here. You cannot leave... I can't deal with this right now. (Sighs) I just feel like I had a right to know as her mother. Well, I'm sorry, but my loyalty is to my patient first. April is an adult, and her healthcare is confidential. You know what? I would accept that if you were some stranger, but you're family. Yeah, well, I realize that, Sara. Which is why I've been looking out for April, trying to make her feel safe. It's all I've been able to think about. So don't talk to me about family loyalty, okay? Especially since you're the one who's held a grudge against me for years. You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral. You know why I did that. You know what? I don't want to dwell on the past anymore. I don't. So right now, if you want to have an open, honest relationship with me, your daughter's doctor, you're just gonna have to move on. I don't understand why you are her doctor. You work in a children's hospital. 'Cause she chose me. She trusts me. Which is a minor miracle, especially given the fact that the last two years you let her think that I don't give a damn about any of you. April. Hey. You talk to your uncle? Yep. She's your sister? I'm sorry. You know, I spent my whole life thinking I knew my dad. He was this great guy who told stupid jokes, and burnt scrambled eggs... And wrote really great books. And had two daughters. Not three. (Crying) Come here. Hey. Sorry to make you walk so far. I forgot how far away this was from the parking lot. No problem. I was kind of surprised to hear from you. I hope it's okay. There's just a lot of stuff going down in my house right now, and I had to get away. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. I just wanted to be around someone who would make me... I don't know. Feel better. Brenna, what happened? My sister's really sick. I saved the last nougat for you. I can't eat right now. I'm sorry, Mom. I felt all alone back there. Everyone seems fine with her denial. I'm not fine with that. None of us are. But I don't think that pushing her too hard is the right thing to do either. Honey, she's scared out of her mind right now. Well... (Sighs) So am I. I know. Mom, what if... We won't lose her. How do you know? No, I don't. But we have to believe that. What's the alternative? Are you doing okay? Yeah. I had a dream this morning. Ape, you're gonna be fine. Just remember what I always say. What? Life is always gonna throw you curve balls. You can't control that. All you can do is keep swinging. That's what I do. Seriously, dad? When's the last time life threw you any curve balls? Trust me. I've had plenty. And I know I haven't always handled them in the right way, but I always try. I hope you know that, April. (Sighs) It's like he was trying to tell me something. (Sighs) Do you think that's possible? Dom?
