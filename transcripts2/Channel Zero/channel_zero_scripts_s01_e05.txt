 ♪ ♪ [police radio scanner] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [police radio scanner] [solemn music] ♪ ♪ So what color is the river? Uh, bluish and sometimes greenish. What... what color's the sky? Blue. And what color is chocolate milk? Pink! [chuckling] No, it's not. It's chocolate colored. Good morning. Ah, good morning. How're you doing, kid? Good. Mm. Ah. Did you sleep well? I did. I did. I dreamt we all went to the beach. Well, good dreams are nature's Prozac. Yeah. Been so long, I felt like I was having somebody else's dream. Oh. What's wrong? [knocking] [tense music] ♪ ♪ It's not confirmed yet. But the wounds... the footprints. It was kids. Yeah. We found Daphne Bell, too. Dead a couple days. In Frances Booth's basement.

My guess is, she killed Daphne, herself, and directed them to kill Jessica. Come on, Amy. We know these kids. There's no way. You heard what the coroner said. You saw the footprints. Kids aren't capable of that. Under the right circumstances... kids are capable of almost anything. We're talking about somebody carving up Jessica here. Children's brains are... Are like clay. An authority figure like Frances Booth could take advantage. This is all hands on deck. First thing is we pick up the four kids I saw. I want to talk to them now. Then we knock on every door, we call every friend, every relative, every former student, until we find Frances Booth. Okay? Good. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [knocks] Yeah? ♪ ♪ I want to see that house.

She says you can't be... you know, investigating stuff on your own. Yeah, yeah, oh, right, right. Um... I'll, um... I'll head back in and meet her at the station. The heck you doing out here, anyway? Um, I... I felt, just... I, uh, I felt sick. Uh, and so I pulled over. [children giggling] ♪ ♪ No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. What? Wait, wait, wait. What? Um, it's not safe. No, I know those kids...

[telephone continues ringing, cell phone buzzes] I'm gonna have to call you back. Okay. Yeah? Amy, it's Beth. I think something's wrong. Tell me. Well, Alex was at Tommy's, but I called over and... He's not there. I know. Can you come back by the house, or can I come in? [telephone continues to ring] He's been acting really strange. All the kids have and I'm scared Amy. [computer screen ticks] [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Amy? ♪ ♪ Amy? Amy? Hello? [gasps] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [chains rattling] And how long will that take? Well, it's...

No better feeling than seeing your kids well-fed. My mom used to say that. I didn't really understand till later, but it's true. Right, Marla? You comforted me for months when I lost my son. And all this time... you were the one who took him away. Well, now I'm here to reunite you. You wanted to tell me something. Tell me about "Candle Cove." What would you like to know? Why? And why us? You are such a stubborn man. Once or twice in a lifetime, if you're lucky... there are moments. Someone slices the world open right down the middle and you can see the sky behind it. The true world. And you understand your purpose. And this was your purpose? Nothing's sadder than a life without purpose. And I had a life like that. You keep telling yourself to be grateful. Have faith. I loved my son. I did. But I was just a void, wasting life and space and air. And powerless. Then something extraordinary happened. I found myself in the presence of something greater. He showed me his power. Something majestic that flowered from indignity. He? I didn't create "Candle Cove." Eddie did. ♪ ♪ It rose out of him like blood from broken skin. No. What are you talking about? You thought "Candle Cove" found him. But what he had was always there. He was born with it. He's the light. The beacon. He always was. He's dead. Only in the literal sense. He's coming back. You're almost ready. You just have to let him in. A fire needs fuel. Power demands sacrifice. I made mine a long time ago. [leaves rustling] [crickets chirping] How did you do what you did? I'm special. Those things I saw, that... That place. Did you show me that? Want me to show you again? Please.

So it could burn even brighter. Now it's your turn. Even after all I've done, you make him a hundred times stronger just by being here. You were both born with something special. He needs you. That's why he wanted you to put him to rest... It had to be you. He loves you. He's broken you down. But only to make you ready. Only because you fought so hard. He's coming back. Through you. You are his blood. You body is his body. He can live again in flesh. [sighs] You can feel it, can't you? It's already begun. The sooner you let him in, the sooner he'll take your pain away. I envy you. Very soon, now. Tonight, maybe tomorrow. Go with him. [sighs] Daddy! Mike? Lily. Mike. Where's Mommy? ♪ ♪ Lily. Lily. Lily. Look at me.
