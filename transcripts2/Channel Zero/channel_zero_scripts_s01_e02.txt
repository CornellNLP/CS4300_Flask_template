 Mike Painter, back on the show. 
 You lost a twin brother when you were 12? 
 In 1988, five kids went missing. The Iron Hill murders. The one they never found was Eddie. 
 You guys remember "Candle Cove?" 
 That show used to give me the worst nightmares. 
 Katie just saw it. 
 Katie! 
 Katie! 
 The only time the show ever aired was during the murders. Now it shows back up again. You were released from a psych ward three days ago. It did something to my brother. It can make people do things. 
 Who made it up? You used to sit, just watching the static. 
 I brought your daughter back. Minus a couple teeth. Mike, we're just getting started again. 
 [thunder crashes] 
 [ominous music] 
 ♪ ♪ The bodies of four missing Iron Hill children were found this afternoon. Police are still searching for a fifth child, 12-year-old Eddie Painter. [static crackles] Laughingstock, that's one whale of a storm. We better run and hide. [thunder crashes] Oh, look. It's Bravery Cave. [laughs] You have to go inside. [laughs] Your new friend is waiting for you. Now it's time to come and play a game with him. But, uh... I don't know how to play. You've met him before. But you don't remember. Katie. Katie. Look under your bed, Katie. We miss you. Come back and visit us in the cave. [screams] Mom! Dane? Mom! Mom! Dane? Dane? Dane? Oh, my God! Katie, what did you do? What did you do? Get away from him. Get her away from him! Mike? Dane's in surgery. She stabbed him in his sleep. She had a hook. Katie, she... Where did she get a hook? She's here, but something's wrong. She won't talk. Look, I know you said that... this show, it can make people do things. Will you please come back? If you're connected to it at all, please. Please. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ That child wouldn't hurt anybody. Unless someone or something made her. It's starting again, isn't it? I'm gonna try to stop it. I'm gonna help you. [soft music] ♪ ♪ Hey. Shh. Hey. I know you. How's Dane? He won't stop picking at his stitches. Yeah. She's under observation until the DA figures out if he wants to charge her. Gary, I asked Mike to come talk to her. You don't think you should have talked to me before asking him back? I don't think that was a good decision. This is what he does. Do you really think that he just happened to find her out there? I think that something is going on with her, something that nobody here seems to be able to wrap their head around. So let's use the resource we have. When I stopped at the house, I got her bird. What? Sit down. [indistinct chatter] How are you holding up, having him home? It's so strange. I barely know him. I just... Do you remember, back then, a kids' show on TV called "Candle Cove?" Something the boys used to watch? I don't know. Jacob watched all kinds of things. It's been such a long time. Look who's back in the middle of things. I just want to help. What's got into her? What makes a nice kid like that try and disembowel her brother? Too much TV. See you around. I'm so sorry. Thank you for coming. Yeah, of course. How are you holding up? I'm not going to win Mother of the Year anytime soon. [chuckles] But you'll talk to me, after? Yeah, of course. Absolutely. Is that for her? Patients in police custody can't receive gifts. Your husband's the sheriff. [ominous music] Excuse me. Do you know what kid drew this? No. Why? Never mind. Thanks. ♪ ♪ She saw "Candle Cove?" "Candle Cove," you're sure? So it wasn't broadcast from here? I wish. I can't believe somebody saw it again. Was this an old episode or something new? Well, I have no idea. Who made it? I couldn't find anything online. Well, that's "Candle Cove." [exhales deeply] How do I go to see it? [chuckles] What? Okay. Okay, sure. You want to see something cool? This is my favorite episode. Laughingstock comes to Iron Hill. Oh, my God. Let's go. What's it about? Action, adventure, friends, enemies, all the good stuff. What's a kids' show supposed to do? Make you feel good, right? Special hook. Make you want to live in that world. That's what "Candle Cove" is all about. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [rustling] You made this. Had you, didn't I? It's fan-fic. It's a love letter. You don't have the real show? Nobody does. It was unrecordable. Something in the signal. Just get this clear. This isn't something you heard about? You actually saw it in 1988? We all did. Funny thing, it never aired on the same channel. Come over one of the dead channels at the end of the dial. You had to find it. Does that mean somebody must have... Was it hacked into other channels? Pirate signal for a pirate show. Pretty clever, right? Katie, does that bird have a name? I have something else. Katie, do you know what this is? Did you draw this? It looks like a pirate ship, a tree, a cloud, and over here, looks to me like a cave. Do you think I'm right? Katie, I'm gonna ask you a very important question. You're not gonna get in trouble. What happened when you saw "Candle Cove?" How long is jail? You're not going to jail, Katie. You're in a hospital because we want to help you. And nobody blames you. What you did was not your fault. I know it wasn't your fault. Where were you all that time? Don't you remember? You've been there too. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Where? Where? The cave where we went. Who's we? You and me? Or you and someone else? Was anyone else there? The boy. What boy? He was underground for a long time, but somebody took him to a cave. And who put him there? Katie? You have to go inside. ♪ ♪ Mike. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ I think it's probably better if you don't talk to her again unless Jess or I are there, okay? Gary, have there been any other missing persons cases around here recently? Other counties, maybe? No. Why? Mike? You okay? Katie's gonna be fine. [doorbell rings] Oh, hi there. I'm Officer Amy. [both chuckle] You're such a dork. Come in. So, somebody broke in? Yeah. I didn't notice 'till this morning. The old keepsake box my mom gave me for graduation? It's gone. Why steal just that? What else do you keep in it? Cheap stuff. And Alex's baby teeth. You keep his teeth? Don't look at me like I'm strange. It's part of him. Yeah. His bones. You ever think about that? Every time you smile, you're, like, showing off your skeleton. Just wait. You'll understand. [phone vibrating] Hey, honey. Hi, Daddy. How was your horseback riding lesson? Good. I rode Gypsy. I gave her an apple. Yeah? Did she have bad breath? Uh-huh. That's because horses don't brush their teeth. But little girls do, don't they? Ha-ha. Hey, Dad? Yeah? What is it, Lily? [ominous music] You have to go inside. ♪ ♪ What? I brushed my teeth after lunch. Daddy, Aunt Carol's coming. She's gonna babysit me this weekend. Mom said I'm not supposed to call you, so I got to go. Love you, dad. Yeah, I love you too. [door opens, closes] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 I found that in the hospital. I think Katie drew it. [chuckles] You think she knows that place? What do you mean? Well, this is a railroad track. Isn't that the cement plant out by the old rail yard where you two boys used to play even though I told you a thousand times? Where are you going? You think she went there? I don't know. I think whoever made "Candle Cove" took her somewhere else before the Crow's Nest. And if she's saying she saw a boy, maybe he's still there. But shouldn't you call Gary? No. What boy? I don't know. Maybe she imagined this boy, or made him up. Well, what if she didn't, and there is a child out there... somewhere hidden? Maybe he saw the show too. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ I don't know how you do it. I look around, I see him everywhere. What good is a change of address if it doesn't close the wound up? Well, not if you keep pressing on it. Did that work for you? Leave home, and the wound just heals? Leave home? You sent me away. It wasn't that simple. That's a defensive phrase. I tried to protect you. I was so young. We could've helped each other. I buried an empty casket. But I always thought that someday, he might just knock on the door. Why would somebody bring Katie here? There's somebody there. Let's call Gary. No. I want to... I want to talk to him. Who? Whoever that is. No, just listen. Just stay here, okay? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [clanging] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [clattering] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [thunder rumbles] [indistinct chatter] Here. Oh, thanks. I called Dale. He said it will take a while to confirm it really is Eddie Painter. He will try to expedite the autopsy, but no promises. Yeah. The way the body was positioned and preserved, it seems almost religious. Maybe. Yeah. They're still here. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Hey, Mike? ♪ ♪ Marla? Thank you. Sure. Hey, listen, Marla. There's absolutely no reason for you to be here right now. You don't need to see this. I wouldn't be able to sleep. There's a kind of roaring in my ears. It's like the sound of... rushing water out there somewhere. That's your blood. It doesn't stop, does it? [soft music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ And you never saw me take snuff. The reason being that in my snuff box, I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese. Eddie? How'd you hurt your hand? I told you. I fell. That's not what Gary's mother said. You two have to look out for each other. You know that, right? Is something gonna happen? I went to James's house and I spoke to his mom about what he did to you. And she laughed. We have to be there for each other, okay? I can't be there for you all the time, okay? And when I'm not... Do you understand? Good. [sobbing] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Why is it when bad things happen, we always bring food? Back then, after they found Jacob, all my friends and neighbors came with casseroles and pies. You're gonna be all right. We're survivors. You still have a son. And he needs you. Like sons always do. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [distorted noises] [distorted] Come inside. [distorted noises] All your secrets will be safe in "Candle Cove." ♪ ♪ [distorted voices, laughing] [approaching footsteps] I need to tell you something. What is it? When they searched the woods up there, they never found anything. Which is very strange. Why is that? You know, I've worked with some mothers who, for various reasons, are unable to bond with their children. Some love really is conditional. Honey, that's true. Do you love me? Of course I do. You're my son. I did it. Did what? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ I killed him. And I buried him in the woods. ♪ ♪ But someone must have taken him away, because when they looked where I buried him, there was nothing there... Stop. No. I have to tell you this. No. Don't say such things. Just... just get out. Get out. I'm... I'm asking you. Asking? You didn't ask when I was 12, did you? Wait. Wait. There's more. Ahh! Ahh. [breathing heavily] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ And as the full moon rose over the school's towers Lucky to have such good, fine friends, and a place where he belonged, and the days ahead still brimming with adventure. [soft music] ♪ ♪ Hey, you. Still awake? ♪ ♪ And as the full moon rose over the school's towers and battlements,  Harry reflected that he was a very lucky boy indeed. Lucky to have such good, fine friends, and a place where he belonged, and the days ahead still brimming with adventure. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [knocking] [knocking] What's going on? Actually, Mike, I need you to come down to the station with me. What for? Answer some questions. About? About something that your mom told me. Really. Let's go. [thunder rumbles] Want me to get in the back? Yeah, in the back. Am I under arrest? Do you want to be? [exhales deeply] [car engine starts] Oh, golly. I've never seen a storm in all of Laughingstock quite like this. We better batten down the... Whoa, oh, gee, we're in for it now. We should abandon ship. Mike? No, don't leave me. Oh, look up ahead. It's Bravery Cave. We should go inside. Ahh! [laughing] He wanted to be mayor. What? Eddie wanted to be mayor. He said we could take turns, and no one would know the difference. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ You missed the turn. Gary? Where are you taking me? ♪ ♪ [clicking] [clicking] [clicking] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [crunching]
