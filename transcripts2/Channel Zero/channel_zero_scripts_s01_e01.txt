 Mike Painter is here with me. 
 He's called "America's child psychologist," and his new book is "Shaping the Past." 
 I'm happy to have Mike Painter back on the show. 
 Thank you. Thanks for having me. 
 So did becoming a father change how you look at childhood? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 You know, at the same time, adulthood is just a mask, a sophisticated mask, for sure. 
 But behind it, we're all still the kids we were. 
 Now, in the book, you talk about your childhood. 
 Uh, you lost a twin brother when you were 12? 
 [fly buzzing] 
 In 1988, in Iron Hill, Ohio, where I was born, um, five kids went missing. 
 The Iron Hill murders. 
 Never solved. 
 Yeah. 
 The last victim, the one they never found was my brother, Eddie. 
 You were identical twins. 
 Losing a twin is like having a... 
 A phantom limb. 
 How does a family deal with something like that? 
 My father was out of the picture. 
 My mother couldn't cope. 
 Um, I was sent to live with relatives. 
 I've never been back to Iron Hill. 
 I want to do something unusual. 
 [static hissing] 
 I have someone on the phone. 
 12 years old. 
 His family's gone through a tragedy as well. 
 I'd like you to talk to him. 
 Show us what you do. 
 [ominous tone] 
 I don't know if that's appro... 
 Are you there? 
 [static hissing] 
 Hello? 
 My name's Dr. Painter. 
 I'm a... 
 I'm a doctor who kids like you talk to about stuff that's on their mind. 
 [clears throat] 
 Is there anything you want to talk to me about? 
 [static hissing] 
 [light chuckle] 
 Can you tell me your name? 
 [static hissing] 
 What is this? 
 [laughing] 
 [calliope music playing over the phone] Is that your TV? [laughing] Turn it off. [laughing] Turn it off. [calliope music continues playing] Mike. Why are you scared to come home? [ominous tone] [telephone ringing] Mike? [telephone ringing] Why are you scared to come home? [flames whooshing] [birds chirping distantly] [toothbrush buzzing] [ambient music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ American goldfinch. Now he's just part of the yard. Hey. I wanted to surprise you. You sure know how. [gentle piano music] Miss Marla, who is that? Hi, I'm Mike. What's your name? This is Katie. Miss Marla? It's my son. He is a lurker, this cat. I swear, he kills for sport. So you're a vegetarian, then? Well, I-I don't eat songbirds. What? No pictures of me or Eddie... or Dad. Well, don't take it personally. It's just a matter of managing intrusive thoughts. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Mom. It really is, um... Why have you come? Just tell me. No, I... I'm so happy to see you. You are welcome here. It's just... I hope you haven't come to rip open a wound. Once every two years, someone turns up in Iron Hill to solve those murders. I've always been afraid that... one day it would be you. [ambient music] ♪ ♪ Yeah, but nothing was stolen? Okay, uh, Bob will take your statement, Mr. Crumm. Okay. Hey, Bob! Line one. Yes? Can I help you? Hi, there, uh, my name is Mike Painter. Oh! Hi. Uh... my mom saw you on Dr. Phil and got very excited. I-I mean, I saw you, too. So, uh, what brings you here? I was actually wondering if I could... Holy sh1t. [chuckles] Yeah. Wow. Mike Painter. Gary. It's good to see you. Actually, uh, I was hoping we could have a quick word. Absolutely. Yeah. We'll go to my office. Nice to meet you. It was a pleasure to meet you, too. [phone ringing, keys clacking] Right? Yeah, it's... [both chuckle] Okay, so Billy Reese was on first. And then, uh, there was someone... some kid on second, and you were on third. Yeah, and you don't remember. No, no, no, no, I-I remember. So they went and elected you sheriff. This is... Yeah. Congratulations. Look, it's not exactly the wild west. I mean, we got drunk people doing drunk things, and... Right now there's some mystery man... He's, uh... he's going around breaking into houses without stealing anything. I don't know. it's just... Didn't the Manson Family do that? Uh, past troubles aside, we're a little bit more "Partridge Family" than Manson Family around here, but enough on all that. What about you? We've... w-w-we've kept on you. I-I even read your book. Oh, man, that's, um... That's kind of you. Well, speaking of past troubles, you know, Gary, I was hoping I could take a look at those files. Do you mind if I ask why? I mean, it's been, uh... 28 years since they dragged those kids out of the woods. Yeah, minus their teeth. Look, Mike, all... All I'm saying is that, uh, a lot of folks, just like you and your mom, lost people back then. So... I'm not saying no. I guess I'm just saying, why now? I'm writing a book. Really? Is it gonna be a good book? I hope so. What I mean is, is it gonna be a respectful book? Above all else. Absolutely. Mike, you know that I-I didn't get stuck here, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's... But did you know that I married Jessica Hale? I did hear that. She would be right annoyed if I didn't invite you for dinner tonight. No. No, no, no. No, no, no. There's a lot of people coming, and, uh... and I think I can help you with those files. But... I need your expert opinion on my kid. Yeah, I-I-I think he's growing up a little bit strange. [polite laughter] Do we have a casino? Weren't we supposed to get one, a casino, in this town? We don't build anything here. Well, whose fault is that? I'll tell you. Oh, here we go. Steam to diesel. When the railroad switched from steam to diesel, that is what killed us. No. Community. How kids are raised. Now everything's all disconnected. What? Now everything's all connected. Now any perv can reach through the Wi-Fi and grope my daughter. We don't even keep a TV in the house. I'll tell you something else. This is not even a town. It's a museum. But you got to modernize. Take the station. [chuckling] If the county gave us funds, what we could do with that. Well... yeah, and when you're sheriff, I think you should do that. Oh. When I'm sheriff, the first thing I do is take down that stupid painting in your office. She's got you there. I know. Dad? I love this town. I absolutely love it. I love it just the way it is. And you know that... Hey, buddy. Katie's been watching TV forever. I want to watch "Labyrinth." It's a tough life, bud. Dane, honey, you tell your sister it's time for bed. And you too... No more TV. [groans] Good night. Don't. Mike. I mentioned this earlier. That kid is obsessed with David Bowie. [snickers] [scoffs] That's strange, right? You're lucky it's not ABBA. [laughs] I wouldn't worry about it. See? I mean, we were pretty strange, remember? We had our own imaginary kingdom. You and Eddie made it up. And you were the kings, both of you. And the card game that never ended. What's that? Well, me and Eddie started playing cards one day... Uh, War, and this one game just... went on and on. There was no winner. So, um, we picked it up the next day and the next. And after a while, I think we just wanted to see how long it would go on. How long did it? Well, I guess technically it still is. And every Saturday... Every Saturday, me, you, and Eddie would watch hours of TV. Of TV. Oh. Hours... Oh, see? You turned out fine. There you go. She turned out fine. Yeah. Well, Mike's the expert. [clears throat] Why don't we ask him? What do you think? Too much TV bad for kids? Of course it is. Where's the bathroom? Down the stairs, just to the left. [rock music playing on stereo] [calliope music on TV] [creepy music] ♪ ♪ [static sputters] Katie? Hey, guess what. You're friends with my mom, and I'm friends with your mom. [laughs] Shh.

I don't know, it's one of these fancy labels, right? Something... Whatever, it's nice. And she goes, "It's stuck," right? And I just said, "Hey. How'd it get there?" [laughs] You did not say that. I did, I did... You guys remember "Candle Cove"? That show? Right? It was on for, like a couple of months... Two months. September, October, '88. I remember. Did you ever tell your kids about it? Oh, hell, no. Well, Katie told me she just saw it. What, just now? What? No. I mean, why would they re-air that? What are you guys talking about? That show used to give me the worst nightmares... Those puppets. I used to have this really weird recurring dream. They would just be screaming. No, that was an episode. No, not possible. It was a nightmare I had. Remember Jawbone? What is Jawbone? Jawbone... He was this,  this old skeleton thing in a robe and a black hat. [ominous tone] And he'd always be chasing around Pirate Percy, right? And he'd say, "When I catch you, I'm gonna skin your hide..." [chuckling] [dishes clatters] Oh, easy there. Easy there. Had a... had a little bit... Little bit much to drink, Mike? I'm fine.

You feel that? Does that hurt, Mike? Mike, does this hurt? [fingers crunch] [screams] [dog barking] Oh, my God. [crying] Get out of here! [Eddie crying] [indistinct talking] Good job. Good job, man.
