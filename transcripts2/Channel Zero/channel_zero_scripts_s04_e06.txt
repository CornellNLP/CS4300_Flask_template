 JILLIAN: This contortionist clown, I made him up when I was a kid, and then, this figure appeared. 
 IAN: You have a condition. What? 
 I know, because I have it, too. 
 (WOOD CREAKING) 
 You're the woman my husband has a kid with. 
 No. 
 JILLIAN: /t's not Tom's. SARAH: He just wanted it to be. 
 Trust gets broken, but you can rebuild it. 
 What if you can't? (GRUNTING) 
 IAN: You and I can do it, but you got to do everything I tell you to. 
 Picture it in your mind. 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 JILLIAN: You helped again. 
 IAN: My first creation, Tall Boy, he did some not-so-great things. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 I know who you are. He's my brother. 
 Half-brother. 
 IAN: I can literally make doors with my mind that monsters come out of. 
 McPHILLIPS: Oh, God! You really think they can just haul me away in the back of a cop car? 
 COP: Stay back, stay back, no! (SCREAMING) 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 (FOOTSTEPS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 What the f*ck? All's fair in love and war. 
 Right, Tom? 
 (DRINK SLURPS) 
 Did you just go to Stuckyburger? 
 After you killed those cops? 
 I need my strength. 
 I guess I could've sent Tall Boy, but he has a hard time keeping a low profile. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 1 didn't get you anything. 
 Where are we? 
 Your wife's house, believe it or not. 
 My dad...our dad left everything to her. 
 Yeah, along with a lot of other stuff. 
 This whole development belongs to her now. 
 I'd congratulate you on probably getting half of it in the divorce, but, uh, something tells me you're probably not going to live long enough... 
 (EXHALES) 
 Everything okay? 
 I'm fine. Pull a muscle or something? 
 Thanks for asking. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Look. 
 I know that this might be hard for you to wrap your head around. 
 But, I love her. 
 You love Jillian? 
 Ido. I really do. 
 I love her in a pure, uncomplicated way. 
 You don't even know her, man. 
 Nevertheless, we have a fundamental connection. 
 Yeah, she doesn't feel that way. 
 You know, the whole thing really f*cking baffles me, if I'm being honest with you. Yeah, you and me both, man. 
 No, I... 
 I mean I get that she didn't know she was special, right? 
 I mean, sure. 
 But deep down, she must have known. 
 And yet, she ends up with you. 
 But the more I think about it, the more sense it makes. 
 You and her, you were friends when you were kids, right? 
 So there's that...that bond. 
 Dad left when she was what? She was eight? 
 Any guy she meets after that, she's going to be thinking 
 "Is he going to break my heart, too?" 
 But not you. 
 You're from before. You're from when she felt safe. 
 That's all you are, man. 
 You just... 
 You're the safe choice. 
 (GROANS) 
 Go, go! 
 Get him! 
 SECURITY GUARD: What are you doing here? 
 Did you see anybody tonight? 
 I see you. 
 Before me. 
 Was anybody here? 
 (RADIO CHATTER) 
 Look, I just got here. 
 I'm looking for... 
 What the hell? 
 Hey, last time I checked, this ain't Halloween. 
 Y'all got to go home. 
 What, is this some sort of joke or something? 
 (GASPS) Hey, hey, no, no... 
 (GROANING) 
 sh1t! (GROANS) 
 (GUARD SCREAMS) 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Oh, my God. Tom... 
 Oh, my God. 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 What did he do to you? 
 I-1 got away, but they...they hurt me. 
 Tom... 
 We got to figure out a plan. 
 I love you. 
 Tom... 
 I don't think we can get out of here on our own, okay? 
 I need to bring back Pretzel Jack. 
 He's my protector, right? Wait, wait, wait. 
 What? Let's just be together. 
 Tom, I need to do this now, okay? 
 Just...just hold on. Hang in there, okay? 
 Just be present for me. Can you do that? 
 Oh, my God. 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 (STRAINING) 
 (GROANS) 
 It's okay. 
 Hey. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 I love you. 
 No, just...Tom, I don't know if we're... 
 (SHUSHES) 
 Let's just be together. 
 Right here, right now. 
 Oh, I just want to feel what it's like to be with you. 
 What... 
 (GRUNTS) 
 What... 
 Let's just be together. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GASPS) 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Jill... No, stay away from me. 
 Jill, no, it's... Me, Tom. 
 You're not my Tom. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (YELLS) 
 (GRUNTING) (CHOKING ON BLOOD) 
 Did he make that or did you? 
 I'm real, okay? It's me. 
 For better, for worse. 
 Tell me something only you know, from our past. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 I think we've dwelled enough on the past. 
 Now that you know it's really me, does it make you any happier to see me? 
 Oh, my God, Tom. 
 (CRUNCHING) 
 Now let's go. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 You okay? 
 I killed my husband. I'm a little shaken up. 
 I killed him. 
 I like to think there's some differences between me and that thing. 
 I just lost control. 
 Something took over. 
 I was killing you, Tom. 
 Look, let's just... let's table this for now. 
 Let's figure out how to get out of here. 
 What if Pretzel Jack really had killed you? 
 Which he almost did? 
 Then you really would be dead because of me. 
 The fact that he went after you means on some level... 
 You want to kill me? 
 You lied to me. 
 Maybe I wanted to kill that part of you. 
 Look, those things are still out there, okay? 
 We got to... 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 Come on, come on. We got to hurry. 
 Go. Get help. 
 I'm the one he wants. 
 Well, he can't have you. 
 Wait. What? 
 This...this is wrong. No, no, no, no. 
 Look, that's the way out. No, something feels wrong. 
 Just trust me. 
 I knew it. 
 You knew where I was. You can sense me. 
 You never would have made it. 
 1 got my...my little guys all over the place. 
 They're very good at hiding. 
 Just let us go, lan. 
 That took a lot out of you, didn't it? 
 Creating that other Tom. 
 No, no, I'll be fine. 
 Just need to recharge a little. 
 Like s*x, you know? 
 If you want to try something very ambitious, you might need a sec to recover. 
 Why did you do it? 
 Why did you make Tom? 
 To be with you. 
 And you know what? It felt good. 
 It felt really good. l...we're supposed to be together. 
 I know you can feel it. 
 I mean, don't you want to learn to use this thing we have? 
 It's what makes us special. 
 I tried to bring back Pretzel Jack. 
 I couldn't do it. 
 Would you forget about Pretzel Jack? 
 Let's make something new. Something that's ours. 
 Right now? 
 Well... 
 Not while he's watching. 
 That'd just be weird. 
 Tom, run, run! 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 Go! 
 (BONES CRACK) 
 In there, in there. 
 (PANTING) 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (PANTING) Oh, God. 
 TOM: Do you see anything? 
 So what do we do? 
 We just...we make another run for it? 
 I need to do something, and you won't like it. 
 I'm sorry for letting you believe that this is all your fault. 
 
 
 
 It's not just my fault, Tom. 
 It's part of who I am. 
 You have a whole bunch of intense sh1t in your head. 
 We both do. 
 And in your case, sometimes, it just gets out, runs around, kills people. 
 But I accept that. 
 And I love you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 This is me. Good and bad. 
 I was ashamed of myself. 
 And I hid that from you. 
 And then, when you tried to tell me your own secrets... 
 I didn't want to hear it. 
 And I'm sorry. 
 So, yeah. 
 Maybe Pretzel Jack is part of you. 
 But I'm the one who brought him back out. 
 It comes from both of us. 
 (DEEP BREATH) 
 I love you so much. I love you, too. 
 He's coming here next. Come on, come on. 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 Wait, what... what are you doing? 
 I'm buying you more time. 
 Come back to me. Always. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 (RUMBLING) 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GASPING) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 Wait, look. 
 We can't kill all of his creatures. 
 And even if we could, he could just keep making more. 
 What we need to do is kill him. 
 Hey, remember, we're on the same team this time, okay? 
 Does that mean yes? Yes. 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 TOM: Jill, what? 
 What is it? 
 This one. 
 I like it. 
 It's clean, simple. 
 That's why I gave it to you. 
 My door. Right? 
 That was you. No, it was you. 
 I just... 
 (GROANS) 
 I just, uh... 
 Gave you a little push from next door. 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 I need you to give me something. 
 You got to tell me, this...this connection. 
 (SIGHS) 
 You feel it too, right? 
 I-I mean, I'm not... I'm not crazy, right? 
 I feel it. 
 But, lan... 
 You're still f*cking crazy. 
 Okay, well... 
 Let me ask you. 
 Where were you, Jill? 
 Why didn't you come looking for me? 
 I thought you must be perfect. 
 And I hated you. 
 Think of all the... All the years wasted. 
 There's so much we could have shared. 
 You could have learned to control the sh1t in your head instead of letting it control you. 
 I want to control the sh1t in my head because I want to protect people from it and protect myself. 
 I don't want to hurt people with it. 
 And you don't have to either, lan. 
 We control this. It doesn't control us. 
 Would you just stop f*cking pretending you're something Tom wants you to be? 
 It's just me. 
 Please. 
 You know he just reminds you of Dad, right? 
 Tom reminds you of the father who abandoned you. 
 Who I killed for you. 
 You took away the only chance I had of forgiving him. 
 Forgiving. Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 You know, I think I knew, deep down... 
 When I found out that you existed... 
 There was only one way this was going to end. 
 No. 
 Stop, let go! 
 No, no. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (POWER SAW REVS) 
 Stop him! I don't think I will. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 No, no. 
 (RAPID BREATHING) 
 (CRYING) 
 That's... No, that's you. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Boom. 
 Rock destroys those scissors. Ugh, every time. 
 Really? Your turn. 
 Come on. Those are the rules. 
 (BABBLES) 
 Hey, what's going on, bear? Huh, what's going on, bear? 
 Yeah, yeah. All right. 
 What's going on? You want to talk to Mama? 
 (EXHALES) 
 (GROANS) 
 Is everything okay? Yeah, she's settled down. 
 Good job. 
 I love you. 
 (SNORES) 
 (LAUGHS) What's so funny? 
 You're just lying here snoring. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I'm tired. Me, too. 
 Who's going to turn out the light? 
 (BABBLES) 
 (CRIES)
