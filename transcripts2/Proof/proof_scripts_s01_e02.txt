 Previously on "Proof"... 
 I'd like you to find real proof of what happens after we die. 
 Charles : Ivan Turing. 
 He may be considering making a donation to this hospital. 
 Great. 
 I also know that you nearly drowned on a trip to the far east to help victims of the most recent Tsunami. 
 You told Ivan Turing I had a near-death experience and saw our son. 
 Oh, that. 
 I don't see us as enemies, Dr. Tyler. In fact, I... 
 Don't you pull that crap on me. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Luke : It's all pretty theoretical, isn't it, what happens when we die, unless something like this happens to you or someone you love. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Well, that's why we're here... 
 To find out about your experience. 
 Tell me about your wife. 
 I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you, Dr. Tyler. 
 I mean, there's a lot I could say about her. 
 She's stubborn, intense, bit of a temper... [Scoffs] 
 And by far the best thing that has ever happened to me. 
 Okay, well, that's true. 
 So, how did you two meet? 
 I'm sorry, but the file we were given isn't very complete. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 I'm a pilot. Floatplanes, mostly. 
 I got this gig flying this photojournalist to shoot some glaciers for this piece on global warming. 
 Total pain in the ass, if you know what I mean. 
 That would be Elina. 
 Elena. 
 It's Elena. 
 And about halfway there, we develop engine trouble and I have to set her down on this lake deep in the backcountry. 
 It took them two days and nights to find us, and by the end of it... 
 You were in love? 
 Actually, we hated each other more than I thought was humanly possible, but she still demanded that we get to that photo shoot. 
 And then on that flight, we started laughing about it, and, uh, I decided to ask her out. 
 I  asked  you  out. 
 All right, she asked  me  out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But after that, I don't think we were apart for a minute. 
 I mean, we did everything together. 
 Really? 
 I mean, you're a busy pilot, she's a photojournalist. 
 I mean, how the hell did you manage that? 
 You know, we just decided that if it was gonna be forever, that spending time together, just the two of us, was important. 
 So, we made it a priority, you know? 
 I mean, camping, hiking, even taking baths together, with candles. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Always lots of candles. 
 That's what makes it romantic. 
 Why is it the tough ones always turn out to be so soft and tender on the inside? 
 But then everything changed. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 I've never been big on doctors, no offense. 
 We're used to it. 
 So, when her headaches started, we figured it was her vision... 
 [Wailing continues] 
 Allergies. 
 If we had known about her heart condition, her, uh... 
 Atrial septal defect. 
 We might have had it checked sooner. 
 One night, she... she starts having these chest pains, and then, I mean, she just collapsed. 
 I thought I'd never see her again. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 It says here in this file that your wife died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and they were unable to revive her. 
 That's right. 
 And then I flew up and I scattered her ashes on that backcountry lake. 
 But that wasn't the end, was it? 
 Look, it's not like how you hear. 
 At least it wasn't for me. 
 There was no weird cold spots, no creaking floors. 
 I just woke up one morning, and I smelled coffee. 
 Coffee? 
 Jamaican Blue Mountain. 
 My personal favorite. 
 And, at first, I figured, you know, "oh, I left the machine on." 
 But when I came into the kitchen, there was a fresh pot brewing and there was Elena, just sitting there sipping her tea with that beautiful smile on that makes you feel like you're the only guy in the world. 
 Look, I know how it sounds. 
 It's crazy. 
 I mean, trust me, I never believed in anything like this before. 
 But now? 
 Call it whatever you want, but Elena is here, Dr. Tyler. 
 I know it. 
 Hey, Charles, got a minute? 
 I got four, unless you want to scrub in on my conjoined twins. 
 [Sighs] It can wait. 
 No, no, no. Talk to me. 
 I'll just be recalling last night's Risotto al funghi disaster in my head. 
 Dried porcini. What the hell was I thinking? 
 Caroline : [Sighs] I may need a psychiatric consult. 
 Ah, good. 
 The first step is admitting you have a problem. 
 [Chuckles] For a patient. 
 He recently lost his wife, and he's been reporting seeing... 
 Manifestations of her. 
 You mean like her ghost? 
 Mm, something like that. 
 Interesting. 
 Amazing organ, the brain. 
 Incredibly fragile and resilient at the same time. 
 And what you're describing in not that uncommon, especially if there's an unusually strong bond. 
 So, you think it's a coping mechanism? 
 It makes sense. 
 The brain may be re-creating the image of the lost loved one... 
 Her sight, sound, smell... 
 And the patient just has to adjust to her absence. 
 Hence... 
 The manifestation. 
 My advice for him... Give it time. 
 Len : We're just about ready for you, Charles. 
 Thanks. 
 Dr. Tyler. 
 Dr. Barliss. 
 Oh, Len, I have to work late tonight. 
 Can you pick up Sophie after her school meeting? 
 Got it. No problem. 
 You two holding up okay? 
 Fine. Thanks. 
 [Car horn honking] 
 Hey, what the hell is your problem? 
 Sorry, Dr. Tyler. 
 Janel! 
 Uh, we... we didn't want to interrupt your run. 
 "We"? 
 Ivan thought it might be a good idea for us to have some transportation for our investigation. 
 [Breathing heavily] He couldn't find an old ambulance with "Ghostbusters" on the side? 
 Do you want that? 
 Beause I'm pretty sure that we... 
 You're joking. 
 It's fine. 
 Do you have any water? 
 Oh, yes. Of course. 
 The next time we meet, there's a diner near here... Spengler's. 
 No one from the hospital ever goes there 'cause the coffee's terrible, the food's even worse. 
 I like the food there. 
 I-I have an update for you. 
 I examined the medical files that Mr. Martel gave us. 
 Martel, the widower. Yes. Go on. [Cellphone chimes] 
 He passed a basic physical for his job about a year ago but nothing to indicate alcohol or substance abuse. 
 Janel : And I followed up with his employer about his termination. 
 He had a perfect record until he told someone there about seeing his dead wife. 
 That's when they fired him. 
 I imagine a lot of passengers frown on their pilots seeing ghosts. 
 Well, there have been many occurrences of very rational people like Mr. Martel who have experienced apparitions, though, as we know, none of it proven. 
 Yeah, there's a more likely explanation, such as hallucinations brought on by the trauma of losing a loved one. 
 Yeah, that makes sense, but it might be interestg to interview these friends and neighbors for possible verification of his account. 
 Unless it doesn't work that way. 
 Maybe there has to be some kind of connection in order to experience it. 
 What are you saying? 
 My second PhD is in quantum mechanics, and the more you study, the more you realize how little we understand. 
 Particle entanglement, multiverse theory. 
 We're just starting to scratch the surface of what might be possible. 
 I don't need a connection or a degree in physics to know that this is just a man stuck in the first stage of grief... denial. 
 I-I don't even remember why we took this case. 
 Oh, Ivan insisted. 
 I think it's 'cause he likes ghost stories. 
 You can tell Ivan that I will be choosing our cases from now on because this one is a complete and total waste of time. 
 [Car door closes] 
 You have got to be kidding me. 
 What are you doing here? 
 This is where I work. You promised me... 
 Mr. Turing. So glad you could come. 
 I'm so glad you invited me. 
 Hmm. 
 You  invited him? 
 Well, when he was considering making that generous donation, I wasn't sure that you adequately explained all the great work that we do here, so I thought that a tour would be helpful. 
 Oh, I'd like that very much. 
 Dr. Tyler, would you like to show me around? 
 Oh, no. I'm busy. I've got rounds to make. 
 Uh, that really isn't a good idea at all. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 I was really looking forward to continuing our conversation. 
 I guess I brought my checkbook for nothing. Mm. 
 You know, actually, I'm sure that we can find someone who can cover Dr. Tyler's rounds for her. 
 Enjoy your tour. 
 That's a gurney. That's a gurney. 
 Another gurney. 
 Janel told me about your visit with Mr. Martel. 
 It sounds fascinating. 
 Well, then you were misinformed. 
 You know, if this is gonna work, you're gonna have to try to put aside your preconceptions, as unfamiliar as that may be for you. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 You did agree to this, you know. 
 I agreed to look into what, if anything, happens after death, not to be a grief counselor for some lovesick pilot. 
 There's a reason I wanted you to look into this one. 
 I heard... You heart ghosts. 
 It's not just that. 
 Luke Martel lost someone that he cared for deeply, someone he loved. 
 Surely you can relate to that. 
 Oh, Dr. Tyler, I have the blood work on Mrs. Chen. 
 You must be the African. 
 Mimi Nina radhi sana kukutana na wewe. 
 Oh, pleased to meet you, as well. 
 I spent some time launching a desalination project in Kenya. 
 Oh, well, clearly you two have so much in common. 
 I'm sure Zed will be happy to finish the grand tour. 
 You'll think about what I said? 
 Fascinating woman, don't you agree? 
 Yeah, she's a very... I'm sorry, tour? 
 Think you could sneak me in to a surgery? 
 It doesn't have to be a transplant or anything like that, but... 
 Could it be a transplant? 
 If you're looking for Ivan, he's with Zed. 
 He's probably getting a tour of the vending machines about now. 
 Oh, thank you, Dr. Tyler, but, actually, that's not why I'm here. 
 I know how you felt about Mr. Martel's case, so I found some other files I think you'll find... 
 Anyway, I think if you'll just take... 
 What do you think about him? 
 Mr. Martel? I-I think he really believes that his wife... 
 No, I was talking about Ivan. 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean, you've worked with him for a while now, right? 
 Since grad school. 
 He gave our commencement address at Stanford, where he trashed tenured professors for being complacent intellectual masturbators. 
 I bet that went over well. 
 Quit my teaching fellowship and sent him my resumé the next day. 
 My parents weren't happy. They're tenured professors. 
 So, what's your opinion? 
 Of Ivan? 
 Oh, I think he's brilliant and creative and... 
 One of the most important... 
 I mean, of all this... Our investigation. 
 What do  you  think he hopes to find, really? 
 Every now and then, there's someone like him... 
 S-someone who isn't afraid to go after the big questions, someone who's never cared about common knowledge. 
 So, I don't think he'd be interested in any of this if he didn't think there was a possibility, a very real one, that we might be able to answer one of the biggest questions there is. 
 Okay. 
 Wait. 
 Um, don't... don't you want to take a look at the files I brought you? 
 What's the matter with the one we've got? 
 I got to say, I'm surprised you came back, Dr. Tyler. 
 It makes two of us. 
 I'm guessing it's not because you believe me about Elena, so why are you here? 
 I wanted to talk to you more about what you've been experiencing and why. 
 Are... are you expecting someone? 
 No. Yes. 
 You really want to know? 
 Elena loved her sangria. 
 We used to have some every night, so I still make a batch for the both of us. 
 I-I can't explain it. 
 It helps me to feel my connection to her. 
 Have you ever thought about talking to someone professionally? 
 You mean like a shrink? 
 A grief counselor. 
 I've done that. 
 I'm happy, Dr. Tyler. 
 I get to be with my wife again. 
 And I don't really care why it's happening, and I don't want to be cured. 
 If you'd lost someone like I did, you'd understand. 
 You did, didn't you? 
 Let's talk about you. 
 Who was it? 
 Was it a close friend? 
 Your husband? 
 A child? 
 I'd rather not talk about it. 
 I started our bath. 
 Most people who have lost a loved one see them in their dreams if they're lucky. 
 I get to be with mine every day... 
 To see her, to talk to her. 
 I mean, wouldn't you give everything you have to feel the same way? 
 Not if it wasn't real. 
 But what if it was? 
 And all that pain and loss you feel... 
 What if  that's  what's not real? 
 I'm sorry, but you don't know what I feel. 
 You're right. I don't. 
 Not anymore. 
 And that really is the difference between us, isn't it? 
 [Knock on door] 
 That's my associate Zed. 
 I asked him to talk to your neighbor to see if she had seen anything unusual. 
 Judith? She's a sweet lady. 
 [Door opens] Luke: I hope she didn't talk your ear off. 
 Zed : Well, she was very communicative, mostly about what a beautiful couple that you two were and how badly she felt for you. 
 I'm sorry. Do you have the water running somewhere? 
 [Water dripping] 
 Do you have a key? 
 I guess I'm late for our bath. 
 You asked me this once. 
 What do you think? 
 What do you want me to say, that that bathtub is proof that Elena's spirit is in that house? 
 Okay, I realize that there's a more likely explanation. 
 Yeah, that he lit the candles and locked the door himself. 
 I'd say so. 
 We need to convince him to come in for a full psych evaluation. 
 You think you can handle that? 
 Of course, Doctor. 
 But it is interesting to consider other possibilities, is it not? 
 I just want to discover the truth, even if that means challenging our preconceptions. 
 I mean, isn't that what you want, as well? 
 What I want has nothing to do with it. 
 Our investigations are about science, that's all. 
 Yes, but even the best science can be affected by bias. 
 I mean, perhaps you can think of this like exploratory surgery. 
 Even if this answer surprises us doctors, we have an obligation... 
 You're not a doctor. 
 Not yet, no matter what it says on your diploma. 
 Just get him in for a psych eval, okay? 
 Caroline : Oh, what's all this? 
 I was hungry. 
 Did you get some dinner? I can fix you something. 
 Do you have to use that bowl? 
 I don't think Will's gonna mind. 
 I know, but can you use another one, please? 
 Hang on a second. 
 Sophie, are you... 
 Are you high? 
 What?! No! 
 I'm just tired, okay? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 It's Zed, right? 
 You've been working with Caroline... uh, Dr. Tyler? 
 Actually, it's Zedan, but... I'm Zedan Bedowi. 
 Originally, I'm f... 
 Yeah, listen, Zed, I got a fetal resection coming up, and I could really use an extra pair of hands. 
 Interested? 
 Well, I've... 
 I've never observed an intrauterine surgery before. 
 [Sighs] I've got some things that I have got to do for Dr. Tyler. 
 Well, cases like this don't come around very often. 
 I'm sure she'll understand. 
 You really think so? 
 Why wouldn't she? 
 I thought you were married to her. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Listen, Zed, she's not heading into surgery right now. 
 I am. 
 You here to learn or what? 
 I don't know what you said to Ivan Turing, but he has reconsidered his donation, which could mean a new wing. 
 I might have you do all our tours. 
 Great. Finally, a purpose to my life beyond life-saving surgeries. 
 Well, there you go. 
 Oh, Charles, that conversation we had about the patient with the visions... 
 What if the visions involve someone they don't recognize, like a stranger? 
 I thought you said it was his wife. 
 Just in case it comes up. 
 Well, that would be more unusual. 
 It usually turns out to be someone from their past, even if they don't consciously recall. 
 Why would that be? 
 It could be the result of some trauma or unresolved guilt, causing the mind to repress the memory. 
 The subconscious has a remarkable way of reminding us of things that we would rather forget. 
 That was incredible. [Chuckles] 
 I had no idea that working on such a tiny patient could be so exhilarating. 
 You were really good in there, Zed. 
 No wonder Caroline's been keeping you all to herself. 
 Thank you, Doctor. You know, thank you for giving me that opportunity. 
 Hey, you should be doing a lot more like that, not being stuck in Caroline's shadow, working on whatever it is she's doing for Ivan Turing. 
 So, what is the... the deal with her and him, anyway? 
 What do you mean? 
 I know that he's financing the medics international expenses. 
 Right. Of course. 
 I was just wondering if there was, uh, anything else. 
 I don't know what you mean. I'm just... 
 Caroline : Hey. What are you doing with my intern? 
 Excuse me...  Your  intern? 
 Zed, did you arrange for that psych eval we talked about? 
 I tried, Doctor, but he hasn't responded to any of my messages. 
 Yeah, well, keep trying, and I need you to go get me the new scans for Mrs. Chen. 
 And I'm looking for a former patient, a woman, deceased, so I need you to go into my files... 
 Hang on. I've got back-to-back surgeries. 
 I can't spare him right now. 
 Neither can I. 
 I've got an aortic valve replacement coming up. 
 Not until tomorrow. I checked the O.R. schedule. 
 You know what this is? This is the custody hearing all over again. 
 I think orthopedics actually needs me. 
 Stay where you are! 
 Don't move! 
 
 
 
 So, I've got another surgery coming up right now, and... 
 And you need him for... What was it... 
 To get some scans and go through your files? 
 Why don't we go ask Dr. Richmond what he thinks? 
 This isn't over. 
 I think she's really pissed at us. 
 Dr. Tyler, I-I'm so glad I found you. 
 Ivan was really excited to hear that you went back to visit Mr. Martel. 
 He's convinced there's something very intriguing there, and so am I. 
 So, I persuaded him to buy us some equipment for our investigation... 
 Thermal-imaging cameras, motion sensor, EVP Recorder. 
 It's all the latest stuff. 
 I hope you kept the receipts. 
 But... I spoke to Zed and he told me about the bathtub, and I told Ivan, and he thinks... 
 Well, I can imagine what he thinks, but until I exhaust some more plausible explanations, let's just hold off on all the poltergeist gear, all right? 
 Okay. Fine. 
 There is something you can do for me, though. 
 Sure. Sure. Anything. 
 I need you to go through all my patient records. 
 Patient records? 
 I'm looking for a former patient of mine. 
 A woman, mid-50s or 60s who might have died during surgery or right after, but probably connected to the surgery. 
 If there's a photo, she might be wearing a green scarf. 
 Does this have anything to do with our investigation? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 It depends on what you find. 
 Should I go now? 
 Please. 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 Caroline : Luke, what are you doing here? What happened? 
 Uh, nothing. 
 Uh, I-I-I fell. 
 Yeah, the steps get slippery when it rains. 
 My... my intern's been trying to reach you. You didn't return his call. 
 I've been busy. I should go. 
 What's going on? 
 Look, I love her, Dr. Tyler, but when she's feeling jealous, I-I just... 
 Wait, are you saying that Elena did this to you? 
 What does she have to be jealous about? 
 Don't come back anymore, please. 
 You know what? I really think you should just talk to someone. 
 There are people... 
 Just stay away. 
 It's for the best. 
 Everything went fine. 
 I'm just gonna keep her in the I.C.U. overnight for monitoring, but you can go in and see her as soon as she wakes up. 
 Dr. Tyler, there is a gentleman here who's been waiting to see you. 
 Dr. Tyler, hello. Can we talk? 
 I just spent seven hours in my first surgery today, and that was the easy one, so... No. 
 Well, I'm writing my new book, and I was wondering if I could follow up with you on the Lily Seaver story... 
 The little girl who had a near-death experience. 
 You see, I was wondering how you got involved in that, uh, case? 
 I'm not gonna help you write your book, okay? 
 So why don't you just make it up, like you do everything else? 
 I'm also including a fascinating story on a local man... 
 A seaplane pilot who has reported seeing the ghost of his dead wife. 
 But that's not the most interesting part of the story. 
 You see, when I spoke to him, he said he had been visited by a heart surgeon. 
 Are you mending broken hearts now, too? 
 I have nothing more to say to you. 
 You don't have to. I'm getting a... a mental picture... 
 Gold. 
 No, no, not gold. Money. Lots of money. 
 Very rich man. Tall, distinguished. 
 Cut the crap. 
 How do you know about Ivan Turing? 
 Where else do you think he gets so many of his fascinating files from? 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 Ivan : Dr. Tyler. 
 Why didn't you tell me that you were in bed with Peter Van Owen? 
 Did we have an appointment? 
 Janel didn't tell me you were coming. 
 It's 'cause you knew. 
 I would never say yes to your deal. That's it, isn't it? 
 Are you a sports fan, Doctor? 
 [Sighs] What does that got to do with anything? 
 Well, I just bought a new start-up that actually found a way to generate electricity from stadium seats. 
 Imagine it... every time 50,000 fans stand up to do the wave, they could generate enough electricity to light this place for hours. 
 Peter Van Owen is a fraud. 
 Maybe, but he has access to the kinds of unusual human experiences not many other people have. 
 Sure, he has his bias, but so do you. [Sighs] 
 If I have a bias, it's for science and rational thought. 
 So what? 
 If I wanted to, I could hire a thousand scientists to look into life-after-death experiences, but I don't think that's the best way to answer this question, and, frankly, I don't have that kind of time. 
 I know, but Peter Van Owen... 
 I think the answer will come from those files. 
 And I'm hoping that if there's even a shred of truth in any of them, that someone with your intelligence and unique experience will be able to find it. 
 You promised me that you would keep our arrangement strictly between us. 
 And I kept my promise. 
 Mr. Van Owen must have figured it out on his own. 
 [Sighs] You know what? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I'm out. 
 No, you're not. 
 Excuse me?! 
 You're too curious to quit now. [Scoffs] 
 You see that group of people over there? 
 Curiosity led them to find a way to create light from people standing up and sitting down. 
 I think you're curious about what you might find... 
 Too curious to leave this to the Van Owens of the world. 
 But I've been wrong before. 
 Once. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Len : Is she ready? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Is it about that intern Zed? 
 I tell you what, I'll... I'll wrestle you for him. 
 I mean, our honeymoon, you... you kicked my ass. 
 Yes, 'cause you don't wrestle to win. It's about Sophie. 
 [Sighs] I think she might have been stoned the other night. 
 Oh. 
 "Oh"? 
 Is that all you're gonna say is "oh"? 
 Well, she's a teenager, Cat. 
 I mean, it's not great, but it's pretty normal. 
 I caught Will a couple of times, you know? 
 No, I didn't. Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because I knew you'd react like this. 
 I mean, it's not like we never... 
 Hi, Dad. Bye, Mom. 
 I'll talk to her, okay? 
 I will. 
 And think about that wrestling offer. 
 I know  I  will be. 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 [Click] 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Pounding on door] 
 Caroline : Luke! Open the damn door! 
 What are you doing here? 
 I asked you not to come back. 
 I have a child who could have been at home. 
 You understand me? A child. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The fire in my trash can. 
 Oh, my God. Elena. 
 Stop it! 
 It's not Elena, it's you... 
 The bathtub, the scratch on your head, the fire, all of it. 
 It wasn't. I swear. Why... why would I do that? 
 I don't know, but this is gonna end. 
 I want a complete mental and physical work-up on you so I can figure out what's really going on. 
 Either you agree to that... 
 Or what? 
 Or I will call the police, and you can explain to them how your dead wife set the fire at my house. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 He is a lucky man. 
 If you hadn't brought him in, we might never have found this. 
 It looks like a tumor or a lesion. 
 But the lesion is near the dorsal raphe nucleus. 
 He's young for stroke. 
 Did he ever have any head trauma? 
 He's a seaplane pilot. 
 He had a rough landing a few years ago. 
 And he never had an exam or an M.R.I. after that? 
 Not a fan of doctors. 
 Yeah, well, I'm not a fan of mechanics, but I do get my oil changed every once in a while. 
 This lesion... Do you think it could account for hallucinations or changes in behavior, maybe some form of schizophrenia? 
 Ah, so this is our friend who has been seeing visions of his dead wife. 
 Looks like now we know why. 
 And you seem a little disappointed. 
 No, it's just I'm... I'm wondering how he'll take it. 
 When he learns all this is the result of his lesion? 
 When he has to let her go. 
 The miracle is, is that he survived this long. 
 He needs surgery, Caroline, and the sooner the better. 
 Dr. Tillman asked me to scrub in on his anterior cervical disectomy. 
 He wants me to do the fusion of the C-4 and C-6 vertebrae. 
 Well, who am I to stand in the way of a sexy spinal fusion? 
 Go get 'em. 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 Wait. Where's he going now? 
 I need him to come visit a patient with me. 
 I think our little Zed is ready to leave the nest. 
 He could be the real deal, you know... a natural surgeon. 
 Don't clip his wings so you can have someone run errands for you. 
 [Knock on door] 
 How are you doing? 
 Not bad, considering your Dr. Richmond wants to saw into my skull and cut open my brain. 
 And you wonder why I hate doctors. 
 You need the surgery, Luke. Look, I know how you feel... 
 I already said yes. 
 I signed the forms and everything. 
 See? 
 Good. You made the right decision. 
 Yeah, I didn't really have a choice, did I? 
 I mean, if there's even the slightest chance I did those things, you know, that could have hurt people, I couldn't live with that. 
 But you don't believe those things really happened? 
 I think it's a hell of a lot easier for people like you to believe there's a logical explanation to things they can't understand. 
 "This guy's seen a ghost. 
 Uh, must be something wrong in his brain." 
 There is something wrong, Luke. 
 And if you're right... 
 I'll never see my Elena again. 
 I just hope to God that you're wrong. 
 Dr. Tyler... 
 If it's all the same, I think it would be best if you weren't there... 
 In my surgery. 
 I mean, you know how she feels about you. 
 Charles : Can I get a superior A.P. view? 
 I know this is not your specialty, but Dr. littman is 10 minutes late and Dr. Flynn is stuck with an emergency trauma case and I could use some backup. 
 I really don't think I'm the best choice for this. 
 You're a surgeon, we're short-handed, you're already prepped for your next case. 
 Stay. 
 [Sighs] Of course. 
 Anesthesiologist : B.P. Is 117/75. 
 O2 sat is normal. We're good to go. 
 Good. I have a nice, little jidori chicken at home that isn't going to lightly bread itself. 
 [Device whirring] 
 [Monitor beeps] That's weird. 
 What? Talk to me. 
 Well, for a second there... 
 That's fine. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. All good. 
 Okay? Here we go. 
 [Device whirring] 
 Nurse : Wait. 
 What's going on? 
 Caroline : Maybe it's the interference from the saw. 
 Uh, who prepped this room? 
 I did, Doctor. Everything was fine. 
 Looks okay now. 
 I'll get someone from engineering. 
 Maybe I should go. 
 What? Are you afraid we have a ghost in the house? 
 [Laughter] 
 Now, nobody panic. 
 Diesel generator will kick in any second. 
 [Generator whirring] 
 Anesthesiologist : Patient stable. Do you want to continue, Doctor? 
 What I want is to have this room checked top to bottom. 
 Close him up. And you know what? 
 Just for the hell of it, why don't we burn some sage? 
 I heard that was a very interesting occurrence that happened in one of the operating rooms today. 
 Engineering is looking into it. 
 They're pretty sure it's connected to the sewer construction next door. 
 I know that's the official story, but if you want me to research... 
 I don't, and the truth is, I won't be needing your assistance at all anymore. 
 I'm sorry. I don't unders... 
 Look, you came here to become a doctor, not to look for evidence of life after death. 
 And I know I dragged you into all of that, but now you're done. 
 Dr. Tyler, this is something that... 
 I don't need your help. I can't be any clearer than that. 
 Good luck on your next rotation. 
 Glitches? 
 You're telling me I didn't have the surgery because of some glitches? 
 They're doing some construction on a new sewer. 
 They may have hit an electrical conduit. 
 You were there, weren't you, in the operation, after I clearly asked you not to? 
 That had nothing to do with it. 
 Huh. 
 So, what now? 
 Dr. Richmond rescheduled it in another room. 
 And I promise not to be there. 
 And what if I change my mind? 
 Luke, you need the surgery. 
 You will die without it. 
 Okay, you understand that, right? 
 Luke? 
 I get it. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. You go ahead, you get some rest, and I'll check on you a little bit later. 
 Is the patient file I asked for? 
 "Prognosis and treatment for advanced adenocarcinoma"? 
 This is a medical research paper for Ivan Turing's illness. 
 I just wanted to be sure he's getting the best care possible. 
 He's a billionaire, Janel. 
 He's being seen by the best oncologists in the world. 
 It's not my field, but you shouldn't get your hopes up. 
 I know. 
 It... [Sighs] 
 It's just, when I think about him being gone... 
 I'm sorry. 
 This is so unprofessional. 
 Kind of is, actually. 
 So, what did you find out from my files? 
 Right. 
 Well, I looked at all your past surgical patients, cross-referencing for middle-aged women who either died during surgery or soon after. 
 And? 
 There weren't very many at all. 
 You're a very good doctor. 
 I know. Did you find her? 
 I'm sorry, but there wasn't anyone fitting that description. 
 If you had a patient like that, she must still be alive. 
 Okay. 
 I brought you some orange juice. It's not exactly sangria, but... 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 Where's the patient in this room? 
 Nurse : We need security stat! There's someone on the roof! 
 Luke! 
 Hello, Dr. Tyler. 
 What are you doing? 
 I thought it was pretty obvious. 
 Don't. Don't do this. 
 No, no. Stay back. 
 Stay back. 
 You don't have to worry. 
 I-it's the best way for us to be together. 
 Wait. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe we're both just three seconds and ten stories away from being with the people we love. 
 I knew you'd understand. 
 But what if you're wrong about everything else? 
 What are you talking about? 
 What if all of this was just Elena's way of getting you the help you need? 
 She knew how you felt about doctors. 
 Maybe... maybe she wants to save your life, not end it. 
 Isn't that what you do for someone you love? 
 You're just trying to confuse me. 
 There's another life after this, a better one, Dr. Tyler. 
 I-I wish you could see that! 
 Then prove it. 
 You know that's not possible. 
 Some people I know would disagree. 
 There is a way, you know? 
 Have the surgery. 
 And if Elena's still with you afterwards, then you know for sure that she's really here. 
 But if you don't and all of this was because of a lesion, then you will be killing yourself for nothing. 
 I just want us to be together again. 
 I love her, Doc. 
 Then jump. 
 What? 
 Go ahead. 
 But if you're wrong... 
 It's just a quick trip that ends in nothing but an ugly stain on the pavement, no life after this one, no Elena, no anything, at all, ever again. 
 Your choice. 
 Okay, can we take a texting break? 
 Sophie : Yeah, in just a minute. 
 We're eating. [Cellphone chimes] 
 Your friends can wait. 
 It's not  my  phone. 
 Oh, wait. That might be this... [sighs] 
 It's Dr. Richmond. 
 "Luke's surgery went well. We'll know until the morning. No ghosts this time." 
 It was a man with a serious medical issue who believed that his wife came back to be with him. 
 So, it's a ghost story? 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Mm, it's more of a love story, I think. 
 Caroline : Zed. 
 Yes, I need to speak with you. 
 Can it wait? We're just in the middle of... 
 No, no, no. It... it can't wait. 
 You spoke of my reasons for coming to this country. 
 I did come here to learn to be a doctor... 
 Just like you, a good doctor. 
 What, I'm just a good doctor? I think I'm a lot... 
 Please, just let me finish, okay? 
 During my time already, I have worked with you to save the life of a man who had been shot through the heart. 
 I have helped repair the lungs of a fetus still in her mother's womb. 
 I have done things that I-I-I never thought possible, and I want to continue to do these things to grow as a doctor, but I can only do that and explore this mystery of what comes after life with you. 
 And... and since I'm sure that you need me, too, as there are very few sub-saharan interns with my skill and my discretion, that I am... I am... I am asking... 
 No, I am demanding that you let me continue to assist you in your research! 
 Are you finished? 
 Yes, I think so. 
 Then what are you still doing here? 
 There's a lecture next week being presented by a "past life regression therapist." 
 It sure would be nice to know what the hell that was before we got there. 
 Wait. Does this mean that you're gonna... 
 It means go home, or do I have to find one of those other sub-saharan interns? 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 Well, dinner's cold, so I figured we should just skip right to dessert. 
 Ice cream, anybody? 
 Fine. Yeah. 
 You get the spoons, I'll scoop. 
 So, who's the better surgeon, my mom or my dad? 
 Caroline : That's a very good question. 
 Zed? 
 I think that... 
 Ice cream sounds delicious. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're discreet, I get it. 
 But, seriously, answer the question. 
 Uh... It's vanilla. 
 That is... That's my favorite. 
 Two scoops for me. 
 Caroline : How's he doing? 
 Uh, physically, he's fine. 
 I ordered a few tests, but he's good to go home in a few days. 
 And? 
 The visions are gone, and that's gonna take some getting used to. 
 It's hard enough losing someone you love once. 
 [Sighs] 
 You can come in. 
 She's gone. 
 I'm sorry, Luke. 
 You were right. 
 She was never really here. 
 And I almost cashed in my chips for nothing. 
 You were sick. 
 And I'm better now. 
 Hmm. 
 Hey, I talked to the charter company, and they said if everything checks out, they're gonna let me fly again. 
 That's great, Luke. 
 Sorry, Doctor, I need to take Mr. Martel for his tests. 
 Well, I guess we proved this is all we get, when you're gone, you're gone. 
 All we proved was that your experience with Elena was a result of the injury to your brain. 
 We don't know for certain what happens when we die. 
 Not yet, anyway.
