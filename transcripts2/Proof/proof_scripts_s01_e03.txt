 Previously on "Proof"... 
 Wait. So, you actually met Ivan Turing? 
 What's he like? 
 You mind if we skip the usual chit-chat? 
 I'm dying. 
 I'd like you to find proof of what happens when we die. 
 You lost your teenage son in an automobile accident. 
 I also know that you nearly drowned on a trip to the Far East to help victims of the most recent tsunami. 
 And that's when you had your own near-death experience. 
 I guess we proved this is all we get. 
 When you're gone, you're gone. 
 We don't know for certain what happens when we die. 
 Not yet, anyway. 
 [laughter] 
 Yeah, but Tommy wouldn't do that. 
 [laughter, indistinct conversations] 
 So, we're over the jump zone, and Sarge says, "If you don't jump, I'm-a shove my fist up your ass." 
 And the guy says, "So, did you jump?" 
 And he said, "Yeah, a little at first." 
 [laughter, gunshot] 
 Incoming! 
 Roadblock! 
 Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
 Machine gun! 
 [gunfire] 
 I need a medic! 
 [gunfire, explosion] 
 I need a medic! 
 We need cover between us and that tree line over... 
 Tommy, we need to get out of here now! 
 Let's go! 
 [explosion, gunfire] 
 Move! Move! 
 On the ridgeline! Left flank! Left flank! 
 [explosion] 
 Tommy, get it together! 
 Come on, Tommy! Follow me, okay? 
 All right, boys! Let's go! Now! 
 Follow me! 
 Tommy : No, Buddy! 
 Buddy, no! 
 Daniel :  Okay, Liam, what did you do next? 
 He was shot. 
 Yes. 
 You said he was shot in the back? 
 Breathe. [ whimpers ] He... He dropped his rifle. Take a few deep breaths. [ groans ]  He's bleeding bad. Just relax. I've got to get to him. Okay. Lights. It's over. Thank God. Wait. Not yet. That was one of my newest patients... Liam... an Iraq War veteran suffering post-traumatic stress. I'd like to introduce the real Liam, who's here tonight. Liam, go ahead and stand up. [applause] It seemed obvious at first that his PTSD must have come from trauma experienced during his military service in Iraq. But after months of traditional therapy and the help of veteran services, Liam couldn't identify the source. His trauma wasn't traceable This is fascinating. to any of the usual triggers. I thought this was regression therapy. He became more and more frustrated, losing sleep, suffering incredible pain and depression. He got so desperate that he agreed to try regression therapy with a witch doctor like me. [light laughter] If you're so resistant, In multiple sessions why did you want to come here? of regression therapy... I found him on the Internet. ...we began to peel back the layers... Besides, we're supposed to be looking into this kind of crap. ...looking for the genesis I'm trying to keep an open mind. of stress and anxiety... Well, it's not working. Under my hypnosis, Liam began to speak in graphic detail about an actual battle, Operation Showdown, and the experiences of a soldier who was part of the 31st Infantry, this Tommy. It became clear to me that these couldn't possibly be memories from any battle or fighting in Iraq. This was something different. This was something else entirely. I believe what Liam was recalling were memories from a past life and the real source of his PTSD doesn't come from Iraq but from serious trauma that he experienced during a battle he fought in during the Korean War... 30 years before he was born. [audience murmuring] Hang on. I want to go talk to him. If you plan to publicly humiliate him and everything that he stands for, then I'd prefer to wait outside. I'll try to keep the bloodbath to a minimum. Carolyn. [chuckles] Wow. Oh. I think the last time I saw you, we were dissecting a corpse. Actually, I'm pretty sure it was in medical school. [both laugh] This is Zed, one of my interns. Ah, nice to meet you, Zed. [chuckles] Nice to meet you. Can you believe back then this woman had us all quaking in our boots? Mm... Yes. Yes, I can. Please, you were the one who was the top of our class, as I recall. Almost. I was always behind you. What, you still bitter about that? Yeah, a little. At least it was a nice view. Well, that's true. And you're welcome. [chuckles] Shall we? Daniel : So, you're a chest cracker. Not a surprise, I guess. You were always the "Top Gun" type. What can I say? I've got a need for speed. Mm. And what about you? How did you... Go from the top of our class at Penn... near  the top of our class... to this voodoo science? Your words, not mine, but, okay, yeah. Turns out, I wasn't cut out for this blood-and-guts stuff. Holding someone's life in your hands... like you do every day... wasn't for me. But I love psychiatry... two crazy parents. And then I started to s... Ryder : How did you read my book before it was published?! Excuse me. Liam : I don't know anything about a damn book. What am I talking about? You stole my story! What do you mean,  your  story? Why don't you just admit it? Everything you got, you got from my book... the whole damn thing! Hey! Hey! Back off. What is going on here? How'd you do it? How'd you read my book before it was even published? What book? I don't know anything about a damn book. Okay, that is such bullshit! Everything you said is in that book... every detail! Take it easy. I said back off! Take it easy. Come on. Get this guy out of here. Oh! Okay! Enough, enough! [both grunting] Did you say something to set him off? No. I was just talking to another vet about his tour in Iraq, and the crazy b*st*rd just started laying into me. So, what was this stuff about a book? Listen, when you talk, he talks. Can you help me out, here? The guy... Look, the guy, he kept saying I stole his whole story, okay? The guy's a nut case. So you've never seen him before? No. But I'd like to go finish what he started. Cat : Look, take it easy. I'm sure Daniel didn't bring you here to get charged with assault. I just want to get this stuff out of my head, and that guy really pissed me off. I know. I'm gonna get you a cab. You okay to go back to the hotel? Yeah. I'm fine. I got to tell you, though, rehashing our session tonight was, uh... it was hard. It was really hard, okay? [sighs] Zed : The bleeding has almost stopped. Thanks, man. Hey, you believe me, right? That guy Liam... he's a total fraud. I'm serious. That I believe. Where I come from, very few people pick fights with soldiers unless they're serious. I saw that flier, I knew I had to check it out. I have no idea how he did it. My book, it's a-a graphic novel, actually. Hasn't even been published yet. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. That would be highly unlikely. You think I'm some kind of poser. I'm telling you, I have a publisher. Book's coming out in the fall. That doctor, Daniel Powell... I'm gonna have them send him my book. It's all in there, exactly like he described it. Operation Showdown, two G.I.s... Buddy, Tommy. Past-life story... it's bullshit. Sophie : Hot date tonight? Mm, no, just meeting an old friend from medical school. Male or female? It's not a date. You have something you want to talk to me about? Yes. Okay, uh, check this out. I was thinking maybe we could open up our house to a foreign-exchange student. What, and have some cute guy from France move in next to your bedroom? He doesn't have to be French. Doesn't have to be a guy. Even if we did something like this, it would have to be a girl, not a guy. Where would she stay, anyway? We have an extra bedroom... Will's room. Right, right. Look, it's been a year. We're gonna have to clean that room out sometime. I know. You're right. So you'll think about it? I'll think about it. I will. Enjoy your date. It's not a date. Mm. [horn honks] Daniel : So, how did you end up here? Last I heard, you were in the Sudan or Tibet, performing surgery with a ball of twine and a sharp stick. That's not true. I would have killed for a sharp stick. [chuckles] I still try to go whenever I can. I guess, you know, life happened. Kids? Marriage? Yes to the kids. The marriage not so much anymore. Mm. What about you? Is there a Mrs. Witch Doctor back home? There was. She wanted a husband who was treating mother issues instead of digging into demons of past lives, so she left me for her therapist. Mm, sorry. Yeah. Wasn't meant to be. You avoiding me now, Doc? Is that it? Liam. You won't return my calls. Let's take this up to your room. What the hell's going on? Listen, Liam, the guy from last night, his name is Ryder Newburn. His publisher sent me the galleys of his graphic novel, and they weren't just similar to your story, they were almost identical. What... what... what are you saying, you believe him now? Is that it? No, that's not what I'm saying. That's exactly what you're saying. You believe his crap. Just calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! Liam... Look, if you think I'm a liar... I'm not a liar. No. No! No. No! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right. All right. You're okay. [gunfire] We need cover between us and that tree line over... Aah! Tommy, we need to get out of here now! Let's go! [explosion] Come on, Tommy. We can do this. We're gonna take that ridge. Let's move. Aah! [explosion, gunfire] Tommy! Snap out of it! Tommy, we got to go! We got to move now! You follow me, okay? I need you to focus, Tommy! We're getting out of here! All right, boys, let's go. Okay! Follow me! Tommy : Buddy! [panting] No, no, no. You're safe. You're safe. You're safe. I saw him. Who? Who? Who? Who did you see, Liam? I saw him. That guy. The guy with the book... R-Ryder. Ryder? Y-Yes. He was there. I tried to get to him, but I couldn't, 'cause I was too scared. What do you mean he was there? He was in that battle. That's why we... that's why we know all the same stuff. He was... he was the guy trying to save me, the friend who got shot. It was him. It was him. Okay. Let's get you... It was him. Okay, come on. Come on. It's okay. Cat : What? Daniel : Finally get some alone time with Carolyn Tyler, and the Korean War breaks out. You were really good with him. He's obviously having a rough time. Can't be easy for a guy like that to find out he was once a coward and then to realize he met someone that might have shared that experience... same battle, during the same war. You're not buying it. Well, isn't it a lot more likely that he was so affected by his run-in with this Ryder person that he subconsciously inserted him into his memory? What if it's true? What, so you think it's possible that not only can you take someone back to a past life, but that two people can share the same one? I-It'd be great to find out. Well, maybe you should work your magic on Ryder, too, see if he doesn't bump into his pal Liam above the 38th parallel. That's a great idea. I was joking. No, I know. You're brilliant even when you're not serious. What are you doing tomorrow? Two major surgeries, three follow-ups, and a consult. And after that? Come on, don't you want to see if there's anything to this? There isn't. [sighs] But I have missed that look on your face when you realize I'm right. And if you're wrong? I might just let you buy me dinner again. Janel : Come on, tell me more about that guy at the lecture. Zed : Oh, yes. He's a soldier who claims to have lived a previous life fighting in the Korean War. No, not him, the... the doctor, the one that Dr. Tyler was getting all flirty with. What's up with that? It was disconcerting. I would rather not discuss it. Maya : Zedan? Maya. [chuckles] What are you doing here? I was invited to several cities in America to speak. Today, it is Seattle. [speaking Swahili] Uh, this is Janel. She's a co-worker of mine. You are very beautiful. Are you a doctor, as well? Just the PhD kind. O... kay. Uh, I have a meeting, so it was nice to meet you, Maya. So, Maya, what are you here to speak about? The Al-Shabaab attacks have hurt our foreign funding. I'm trying to get aid flowing again. It has not been easy, and you know how much I hate to be away from home. Yes, it has not been an easy adjustment. So, you're homesick? Then why have you not called in so long? I have been... quite busy. But I will call soon... very soon. Mr. Oumandi will be pleased. He has invested much in your future, Zedan. Yes. I am aware of this. He loves our village almost as much as he loves his daughter. [chuckles] I'm aware of that, as well. So you  will  call tonight, make everyone very happy. [chuckles] Okay. We are all looking forward to your return, Zedan. Cat : You got a minute? Yeah. What's up? Uh, I was thinking about cleaning out Will's room this weekend. Wow. Are you ready for that? Are  we  ready for that? Well, Sophie seems to think so. She suddenly feels the need for foreigners in the house. Right, an exchange student. She mentioned that. Yeah. I'm beginning to realize that being ready really has nothing to do with it. You want some help? No, I've got it. I just... I just wanted to check with you first, see if there's anything you wanted. Thanks. Uh, the baseball, the Kyle Seager foul that he caught. Yeah, in his popcorn box. Remember that? Yeah. He saw himself up on the big screen, and he gave that... big Will smile. Yeah. It's still on his dresser. I'll bring it to you. Thanks. [sighs] How much, if anything, do you know about past-life regression? I know I think it's total garbage. Look, the only reason I'm here is because my publisher is starting to think I stole that liar's story. The idea is that certain events from our past are so traumatic that they remain with us in our emotional inventory, part of our personal history that won't let go. Like I said, it's garbage. Your book went to your publisher three months ago, right? Yeah. Why? Look at this time stamp. I recorded Liam's regressive memory of Operation Showdown over a year ago. He couldn't have read your book. Ryder, what made you start writing this story? Where did it come from? I was going through a tough time. My wife had left me. Started having these dreams, and they didn't make any damn sense. I've never been in the army. Protested every war we've ever been in. The dreams wouldn't stop. I started writing them down. That was six months ago. They were vivid? Yeah. Disturbing? Yeah. And familiar? [sighs] Yeah. Ryder... last night, Liam had another regression, and according to him, the soldier trying to save him in that Korean battle... was you. Okay, I'm out of here. 
 
 I can help you. Yeah? How? By trying to take you back to that battle. I wasn't there. Liam mentioned a new detail... something about snake eyes. Does that mean anything to you? Snake eyes. Did that come from any research you did about the battle? I didn't do any research. The whole thing just came to me... every detail... out of nowhere. I don't even know why I got this tattoo. It just spoke to me. Tumor seems pretty well contained. Once we biopsy the tissue, it's off to Pathology and hopefully good news. Now, Mr. Badawi, if you wouldn't mind. Yes, Doctor. Have you given any thought yet to where you want to do your residency? Well, yes. I'd love to stay here at Bay Vista, of course. Good choice. Since I know the head surgeon quite well, your dreams just might come true. [chuckling] Thank you, Doctor. But I'm afraid it has already been decided for me. Really? I was under the impression you hadn't even applied yet. What I mean to say is that I know where people expect me to go. Well, you know, my family expected me to join the family business. They were morticians. When I told my father that I wanted to be a doctor, he accused me of trying to steal his customers. Don't worry about what other people expect you to do. Do what's right for you. If only it were that simple. Daniel : You're relaxed now, floating. You can no longer feel your body. Your subconscious mind is becoming more alert, focused. Let's start to go back, back to when you were a boy. What do you see? I see my house... my parents. Good. We're gonna take it back even further. Back... back... Let the images come. Don't stop them. Let everything in. Back. Back. The images are flowing now. They're a stream flowing out of your subconscious. Where are you? I don't know. I hear explosions. [ explosions ] [ indistinct conversations ] I'm a soldier. Man :  And the guy says, "So, did you jump?" And he said, "Yeah, a little at first." [breathing rapidly] [explosion] Roadblock! Let's go! Let's go! We need a medic over here! We need cover between us and that tree line over... [explosion] Buddy : Tommy, we need to get out of here now! Let's go! We're gonna get to... That ridge! Move now! I need you to focus. All right, let's go! [gunfire] [explosion] Come on, Tommy! Snap out of it, Tommy! Come on! We can do this! Let's go! Tommy! Look at me. We can do this. Come on. Move! All right, on me! Let's go now! Follow me! Aah! [explosion] [grunting] [screaming] You got him, Tommy! Aah! [panting] You're okay. You're back. You're in a hotel room in Seattle. You're safe now. You're safe. [inhales sharply] Are you all right? [inhales sharply] Yep. Yeah, I'm good. I'm okay. I was... I was in my book. [voice breaking] I was really there, just the way I wrote it. I was... Except for one major detail. In your book, Tommy was a coward, but as you just described him, he was... he was the opposite. So what? These are just stupid dreams. No, this... this wasn't a dream. You were there, and Liam was, too. The two of you were in the exact same place at the same time in history. If that's true... and I still have serious doubts... then why aren't their stories the same? [hip-hop music playing] Cat : So, what's your take on all this, these contradicting stories between Liam and Ryder? I don't know. What do you think? Mm. I think if there's any truth to it... that's if... there must be some reason that one of them is rewriting history. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? Rewrite history? What do you mean? I would walk straight up to you the first day I saw you in anatomy class. And do what? I don't know. Something crazy, like say hello. [both laugh] Why didn't you? Are you kidding? You're Carolyn Tyler. You were incredibly intimidating, not to mention brilliant, beautiful, some other things that haven't changed. Well, I guess we'll never know how that would have turned out. Oh, I know. Uh, you totally would have laid me out. [laughs] It would have been ugly. And then I wouldn't have been able to face you again. I wouldn't have gone to class. I probably wouldn't have graduated med school. That sounds about right. Yeah. God, I almost did, though, you know? Did what? Worked up my courage. I was planning to do it at graduation, but you didn't show. And that was it. [sighs] Never had my chance to tell you how I really felt. Why don't you tell me now? God, that feels so good. I'm next. [chuckles] No way. It's your penance for making me sit through all your past-life crap. You stopped. You really don't buy it, do you? You think I'm wasting my time. [sighs] Don't pay any attention to me. That's pretty hard to do. I think what you're doing is you're helping people who are in pain. Isn't that what it means to be a doctor? Condescending, but I'll take it. [chuckles] I really think if you just give it a chance... I did, remember? And they had very different perspectives. Well, there's got to be a reason for that. We should regress them together, at the same time, see what happens. We? I need you there, Carolyn. Ryder trusts you. I'm sorry. I'm out. I have way too much going on in  this  life. Well, maybe that's because of something you did in a past one. Okay, what are you getting at? Mm, come on. Let me do a regression on you right here, right now. [laughs] Huh? Hypnosis? Mm. I'm really not the type. Or you're scared. Hmm, what's the matter? Afraid you'll find out you weren't Madame Curie or Albert Schweitzer? Fine. What do I got to do? Hmm? Daniel : Close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. This isn't gonna work, you know. Just relax. Breathe. [breathes deeply] Let's start to go back. Even further... to when you were a little girl. Back to the day you were born and beyond. Let the images come. Let them wash over you. [laughs] I'm sorry. I can't help it. Oh, come on. I tried. [scoffs] It's not gonna happen. Carolyn. I really have to go. You said you were gonna give it a try. And I did. I tried. Thanks for everything. [cellphone chimes] Will : Hey, Mom. Sorry I'm late. [horn honks] Mom, i-it's green. [horn honks] Go. So, uh... What happened last night with you and Dad? Y-You guys were having a fight. Pretty... pretty bad one, from the sound of it. So... what happened? You guys aren't breaking up, are you? Mom? Mom! [monitor beeping] [gasps] It's okay. It's okay. Where's my son? It's... it's gonna be okay. Where's my son? My name is Dr. Carolyn Tyler. I'm looking for my son. He's in the O.R.? He's in the O.R. [grunts] I'm looking for my son. Um, Will Barliss? I need to get to the O.R. What room is Will Barliss in? I need to get scrubbed in. I need to get scrubbed in. Carolyn. Carolyn. What room is Will Barliss in?! Carolyn. Will Barliss... what room is he in?! I need to see my boy! I need to see my boy! I need to see my boy! Help me! [crying] I need to see my boy! Get off of me! I... [screaming] [gasping] Aah! Carolyn. Carolyn. It's okay. Carolyn, are you okay? Where did you go? Nowhere. It didn't work. Are you... are you sure? It really seemed like you went someplace. No, no, no, no, no. I didn't. It's just that kind of thing doesn't work on me. Okay. All right. W-W... Carolyn, just talk to me. No. I just have to go. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'll see you soon, okay? You okay? You look terrible. People say my bedside manner stinks. Is there, uh, anything you want to talk to me about? What do you mean? Well, i-it can't be easy going through all that stuff in Will's room. There's no rush, you know. And my offer to help still stands. I got it covered. Thanks. Okay. Just don't forget, you're not in it alone. [elevator bell dings] You know, there... there was something that I wanted to ask you about that... that day. What about it? Do you remember seeing a-a woman in the E.R.? She... she was middle-aged. She had gray hair. She was wearing a green scarf. I-I remember a lot about that day... too much, actually... but not that. Why do you ask? I don't know, maybe it just came back to me from talking about Will's room. But I-I remember now that I saw her there. And... and I saw her again in my near-death experience after the tsunami. And I think I even saw her the other day on the street. Mm. [sighs] Well, I'm not a shrink, but it seems pretty clear what it is. You saw this random woman on the worst, most emotional day of your life, so now, whenever you're going through any kind of emotional stress, like nearly dying, it comes back to you. That makes sense. [laughs] Thank you. Mm. I'm full of surprises, remember? Do you really think it's possible for a past life to affect this one? Does Dr. Tyler? I honestly don't know what she thinks. But I know the feeling. It's that woman who came to the hospital, isn't it? Maya... you didn't seem that happy to see her. Well, her visiting is no accident. What do you mean? [sighs] Okay. When I was very young, Medics International came to my village, and they brought the polio vaccine, they brought antibiotics, and they delivered babies. It seemed every day that 100 miracles were given to us. And I knew right then I wanted to be a doctor. Mm. And then, one day, a very wealthy businessman from my district came to see me because he heard of this boy who had read every single book in the village twice. And I was in school with his daughter, and she was very nice and [clears throat] very pretty, and... We were very, very fond of each other. Uh-huh? Go on. [clears throat] Her father offered to send me to medical school, which, of course, I leapt at the opportunity. But there was always this understanding that when I was done, that I would... Oh, you'd go back to Kenya... ...and the girl. Maya is this man's sister, and her visit here is a reminder that my future has already been decided for me. Isn't that a bit middle ages? I mean, um... Haven't things... progressed beyond arranged marriages? Not everywhere, I'm afraid. Well, do you love her? Uh, this... this girl, uh, back home, the girl back home? No. Then you have to tell her that. She has a right to know. I know. But there will be consequences. Daniel : You sure you're ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah, me too. Hey, man. I'm sorry I punched you. Yeah. I'm sorry I punched you back. How about you, Dr. Tyler? You brought me this far. Might as well see it through. Let's get started, then. Let's go back, back to another time... ...another life. We need cover between us and that tree line over... Aah! Tommy, we need to get out of here now! Let's go! Let's move. Let's go. Man : I need a medic! [gunfire] Tommy, come on! 100 meters. 10:00. Tommy! Snap out of it! Hey. We can do this. We got to move now! You follow me, okay? I need you to focus, Tommy! We're getting out of here! All right, boys, let's go. Okay! Follow me! Aah! No! Buddy! [grunts] [gunfire] [screaming] Aah! You got him, Tommy. You got him. [groaning] Medic! Medic! I just need... just need to put a little pressure on this wound. [breathing heavily] Aah! Shh. Shh. Hey, listen to me. No, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be f... sh1t! [groans] Snake eyes. Just you and me, right? Pair of aces. I need a medic! Hey... hey, look at me. Look at me. Look at me! Don't leave me. D-D-Don't. I won't. I won't. Not ever. [grunting] I love you. Say it. Say it. [crying] Please, Tommy, say it. I can't. I can't. Can't say... [sobbing] [breathing heavily] Daniel : It's okay. [crying] I couldn't. I couldn't. It's okay. You're back. You're safe now. You're home. [breathing heavily] Wow. Yeah. How's Liam holding up? [sighs] Better now that we got to the source of his trauma. You know, I could rearrange a few things, stay longer. [sighs] This has been amazing, Daniel, really. You have no idea. But it's been a really rough year for me... my separation and other things. I'm... I'm just... I'm... It's okay. Another time. Yeah. Okay. One more thing. I think you're more interested in the kind of stuff I do than you let on. It doesn't matter why. I was curious, too, at first. And I became more fascinated as the stories kept coming, and I had to know more. But, um... it came at a price. I lost professional relationships, my reputation, friends. But I knew too much to go back. So, I'm telling you from experience... be careful. Hey. Hey. I was, uh, just gonna grab a bite to eat. You want to join me? I have a consult. But I wanted to let you know, I, um... I decided not to clean out Will's room just yet. I thought... I thought we should do it together, as a family. Okay. Uh, in the meantime, I brought you this. [laughing] Hey, you found it. Pop foul, bottom of the fifth. With the popcorn box. I thought it would shatter his hand. I thought Sophie was gonna eat everything coming down the aisle, including the foam finger. It was the last night we spent together as a family. Yeah, before I screwed up and everything changed. It was a great night. The best. Zedan! Oh, my God. There you are. It's so good to see you. How are you, my love? Hello, Halima. I'm good. I'm good. It's nice to see you, as well. Zedan, you look so handsome... tired but so handsome. [laughs] Well, you know, I've been working very hard. I want to hear all about it, a-about everything you have been doing and about all your new friends. Yes, there's, um... so much that I have to tell you. All everyone here talks about is what a fine doctor you are becoming and how happy they will be when you come home... especially me. Yes, I know. I worry sometimes that you are getting used to being away from home... and away from me. Halima... I can't wait for you to come home, and I cannot wait for us to get married. I love you, Zedan. I love you, too.
