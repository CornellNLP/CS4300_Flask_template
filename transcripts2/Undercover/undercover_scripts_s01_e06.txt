 A dead child, Nick, with the same date of birth as you, the same place of birth on his death certificate. 
 You were spying on me the first time you said you loved me? 
 When Michael told me there was drugs in his shoe, I nearly took him right back to Customs! 
 Abigail Strickland was found dead two minutes away from where I was supposed to talk to her about Michael Antwi. 
 She was coming to see me! 
 It's big. Nick is into something very dark. 
 So my question is, when it comes down to it, which will you put first? 
 The story or Maya Cobbina? 
 I'm not going quietly. You have to go big. 
 Wasn't Rudy killed Mayor Anderson. 
 He was with me, fixing up a truck. 
 But now they've found a man who can prove Rudy didn't do it. 
 What's the name of the man? 
 Vernon Early. 
 When they pulled me out the cell and took me away... your boy wasn't dead. 
 She's not joining up any of the dots. 
 Much bigger. Much more dangerous. 
 Those are the people that should pay for Michael's death. 
 We've taken out an insurance policy. 
 On the whole family. 
 I don't know your name. 
 No. 
 My name is Lola. 
 Vernon Early is dead. 
 He died of a heart attack in a police station. 
 You did this. 
 Who's next, Nick? 
 Maya. 
 Maya, please. 
 Again and again, men die in police custody. 
 There is a small fuss, but the house doesn't come tumbling down like it should. 
 But this time they are frightened. This time they are behaving like the world might just fall apart if they're not careful. 
 Why? Why Michael? 
 Why me? 
 I... I don't know. 
 Then there's no way back for us. 
 But I can find out. 
 Yes? 
 How did it go? 
 There won't be any prosecutions of any police officers in the Antwi case. 
 It's not in the public interest. 
 So that's it? 
 What? 
 It's over? 
 None of the coppers? 
 Where do you live? 
 Muswell Hill. 
 And how old are you? 
 22. 
 Are you happy? 
 No. 
 Do you want to have a wrestle with me? 
 Sure. But maybe we should go somewhere. 
 My house is nice. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Hello? 
 Can we do it? 
 Yeah. 
 Take this off. 
 ♪ When I am with you There's no place I'd rather be ♪ 
♪ No, no, no, no, no No place I'd rather be ♪ 
♪ No, no, no, no, no No place I'd rather be... ♪ 
 Dad? 
 This is Lola. 
 She's my best friend. 
 Oh! 
 Well, hello, Lola. 
 Hello. 
 You're doing the right thing. 
 You think? 
 My father had a friend, a German Jew called Conrad. 
 He discovered after Conrad died that he'd been a Sonderkommando at Auschwitz. Do you know what that is? 
 Yes, um, Jews who worked as guards. 
 Jews with a choice. Suicide or do what you're told. 
 They escorted people selected to die to the gas chambers, and they didn't tell them. 
 They didn't say, "This is not a shower you're going to." 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 Telling the truth can be the opposite of a good idea. 
 John Halliday. 
 The CPS lawyer who was at the police station the night that Michael Antwi died. 
 Mm-hmm? What's the issue? 
 He took a very early decision to charge Peter Mackie, even though the evidence was unclear and there were some obvious holes. 
 Why are you asking me about this? 
 Well, I was wondering if it would be embarrassing to you if we took a better look at him. 
 Why would it be? 
 He's a very senior CPS lawyer on your watch. 
 Are you embarrassed? 
 No. 
 Then neither am I. 
 What do you think of him? 
 We've never met. 
 Tea? Coffee? 
 Is there something you want to say? 
 Michael Antwi was a drugs mule. 
 He came through Heathrow with a stash. 
 Personal use? 
 Intent to supply. 
 There's more, isn't there? 
 Yes. 
 Mrs Antwi, she knew. 
 Later? 
 No, at the time. She knew that her son was importing. 
 The saintly Mrs A. 
 Not so saintly after all. 
 Thank you. 
 That wasn't easy, was it? 
 What's, er, what's happening with the Abigail murder? 
 How do you mean? 
 Where's the investigation going? 
 I don't know. 
 Why not? 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 Jesus Christ. You know what this is like, you know how vulnerable I am, and, and what? Silence. 
 Oh, you know what? Forget it. Forget it. 
 I am done with this sh1t, I'm out. 
 Wait. 
 I was a paedophile. 
 They all came to me and I set them up with what they wanted. 
 Girls. 
 Boys. 
 Pick and mix. 
 I was the Woolworths of depravity. 
 And they were arrested when they went to the rendezvous? 
 Yeah. 
 So you were locking up monsters. 
 Two things about paedophiles... 
 They really feel they're offering love. 
 And they feel really sorry for themselves when they're caught. 
 What happened? 
 My whole life became the paedo unit. 
 "Just be home for bath time," my wife said, "that's all I want. 
 "Bath and bed, then the children will feel like they have a father." 
 I couldn't go home without crying. 
 And I couldn't cry, because... 
 Because we don't do that, do we? 
 And I couldn't explain it, so I stopped coming home. 
 Do you see your children now? 
 I know you much, much better than I know my children. 
 I need to know what I'm doing. 
 I can't go on without knowing why I am spying on my own wife. 
 My job is to keep you happy. 
 If you're unhappy, then I have failed. 
 So help me. 
 Why do I matter so much? 
 The Fever Club. One o'clock, tomorrow afternoon. 
 Knowingly importing cannabis with her son. 
 This came from Corrigan? 
 Indirectly. 
 It has to have come from Nick. 
 Why are you so sure? 
 Mrs Antwi lived with them after Michael died. 
 They were like a surrogate family to her. She must have told him. 
 What are you thinking? 
 How many coppers do you know? 
 Dozens. 
 Why? 
 I pay them for stories. Or the newspaper does, or did. 
 Back-scratching. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You scratch mine, I'll scratch yours. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 The press and the police. Corrigan. 
 And Nick. 
 He's a copper? 
 Nick's a copper. 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God. He's an undercover police officer, isn't he? 
 f*ck. 
 Where have you been? 
 Um... 
 I've been to see my handler. 
 What did you tell him? 
 That Michael Antwi was a drug importer, and that Mrs Antwi knew what he was doing. 
 Oh, God. 
 Ohh... 
 It was the biggest thing I had to give. 
 There's nothing I won't do for them. 
 I'm their man. 
 They believe in me. 
 They... They BELIEVE they can trust me completely. 
 What are you... What are you saying? 
 You need someone at the heart of the story, on the inside, gathering all the evidence. 
 You. 
 I am on your side. 
 I can work for you now. 
 They trust you. 
 All you have to do is... trust me. 
 We're being fed. 
 Why would they do that? 
 What? 
 Because this isn't the real thing. 
 The real story is bigger and they can kill it with this. 
 The Director of Public Prosecutions is married to an undercover police officer. 
 That's our big, that's our story. 
 What does it tell you if Corrigan is giving us something this big? 
 How big does that make the story he doesn't want us to have? 
 I can't find the Scotsman. I've never had this before. 
 Who the hell is he? 
 Keep following Nick. He's going to take us up the ladder. 
 Aargh! 
 What happened? 
 I was running and I didn't see the kerb, I tripped, you know, went down. I put my hand out to break my fall and... 
 Like some stupid cartoon, innit? 
 Get it seen to. 
 Yeah. 
 I know why you're here. 
 You going to tell me, or...? 
 It's written all over you. 
 There was a UC inside the Richardson family. 
 Did you know that? 
 Yeah. 
 Charlie had a personal pilot for his private jet, he was Old Bill. 
 The stress was unbelievable. 
 Inside the IRA, very tough. 
 None of them came out emotionally intact. 
 But spying on your own wife? 
 Probably the hardest of the lot. 
 We are very grateful. 
 Is that it? 
 Is that it? "Thank you"? 
 "Thank you for all you've been doing"? 
 I am betraying my wife every day, and what do you give me in return? 
 Loud and clear, you don't trust me. 
 Has she ever suspected? 
 No. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 I'm sure. 
 I did think about what would happen if she did find out. 
 And... I would die. 
 Do you know that? 
 It would feel like dying, anyway. 
 That's the risk I run for you. 
 Your man in the, the Richardson family, he knew what he was doing. 
 That bloke in the IRA, same thing. 
 I don't know what I'm FOR. 
 I gave you Abi. 
 I gave up one of our own for you. 
 You've made me part of a conspiracy to murder. 
 I gave you Michael's mum, man. 
 Michael's mum, who is probably... probably the best human being I have ever met. 
 How much more of me do you want without telling me what this is all for? 
 You tell your Scotch guv'nor I don't need his protection, especially from a total amateur like you. I'm not... 
 What? You're not what? 
 Who are you? 
 You're press. 
 He's wobbling. 
 Christ. 
 Now? Just when... 
 He's right on the edge. 
 Is it, is it time? 
 Let me hear you say it, Halliday. 
 You know... 
 What? 
 Not yet. 
 That's plan B. 
 Plan A? 
 Let him know how much we need him, and a little bit of why. 
 Meaning? 
 Get him Greenlaw. 
 Sure. 
 Why does he need to see me? 
 Because you're impressive. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 You sleep with all sorts of women half your age who are not your wife, for example. 
 I don't think they're doing that just because of your looks. 
 Power impresses. 
 "Call me Minister, bitch." One of your lines, I'm told. 
 I'm not frightened of you, spook. 
 You should be. You're all bluff. 
 It's a long way down your nose to me. 
 I'm not seeing him. I won't risk it. 
 I'm only going to say this once. 
 You do what I say or I will cut your smaller-than-average pen1s off, chop it up and send slices of spotted dick to all the women in your life. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I forgot. 
 
 
 
 Mr Johnson? 
 Here's your pass. 
 Thanks. 
 Please, follow me. 
 Yeah. 
 Mr Johnson to see you, Minister. 
 So it must stop you from swimming. 
 Er, yeah. 
 Running. 
 How do you know? 
 The plaster. 
 Yeah, right. But I mean, how do you know I'm a triathlete? 
 I'm well-briefed. 
 By who? 
 You all talk to each other? 
 We are very grateful for what you do. 
 Now, I know it's impossible for any public recognition to come your way, so this is the best we can do, I'm afraid. 
 But what have I done? 
 What am I for? 
 We've been working for this moment. 
 Together we've been making sure that police officers who made a small mistake a very long time ago are not put on trial. 
 Why not? 
 We live in a tolerant society, and none of us want to disturb that. 
 And after 20 years, we are so glad that the DPP understands how right we've been. 
 So I give information to my handler, and it works its way all the way up to you. 
 And the world is a safer place. 
 Yes. 
 I got it. 
 I got it. 
 There's something else. 
 It's time you knew... about Michael Antwi. 
 Aaah! 
 'Maya, it's me. Uh...' 
 'I didn't get it. The listening device didn't work. I'm, I'm sorry.' 
 I don't believe you. 
 Maya? No, Maya, Maya! 
 You didn't bring the daughter this time. 
 Maya. 
 Pity. 
 I'm really sorry she didn't get to know Vernon Early better before he passed. 
 You know, I, I just wonder what gets you up in the morning? 
 Well, this morning I'm thinking, "Well, here I am in Washington and I'm going to the highest court in the land. But God only knows what we're doing here. 
 Because, rest his soul, Mr Early isn't with us any more. 
 So what? 
 We here to watch Maya Cobbina beg for mercy? 
 Come on. 
 Right. We don't have Vernon, so we don't have the truth. 
 So what are we doing? 
 We're going big. 
 Miss Cobbina? 
 Yes. 
 20 minutes at the podium. Not a second more. 
 We'll cut you off if you go over. 
 Do you want a light? 
 Er, yes, please, um, two minutes, then one. 
 OK. Red light means your time's up. I'll get them in. 
 All rise. 
 Please be seated. 
 Miss Cobbina. 
 The death penalty is unconstitutional, because it is in breach of the Eighth Amendment, forbidding cruel and unusual punishments. 
 Something that the Constitution contemplates can't be unconstitutional, Ms Cobbina. 
 Like slavery? 
 I'm sorry, what's the connection? 
 The original text of the Constitution contemplates that a slave was valued at three-fifths of a person. 
 So...? 
 So the Constitution has amendments because the world changes. 
 Slavery was wrong, but our founding fathers didn't realise quite how wrong back then. 
 The Constitution was written on paper by ordinary mortals, not in stone by supermen, which is why it evolves, which is why it has amendments, including the eighth. 
 I don't need a lecture on constitutional theory from you. 
 Every American has the right and obligation to read and interpret the Constitution for himself. 
 That's pompous. And patronising. 
 It's Thomas Jefferson. 
 I'm an Englishwoman, and I know the Constitution of the United States backwards. 
 Not because I'm a lawyer, but because I love the language it contains. 
 Its genius is that its, its words are unrestricted by history, tradition, precedent. 
 Their genius is that they leave all of us -- people, lawyers, Justices -- free to take meaning not from reading the Constitution but from reading life. 
 Why don't you get to the substance of your argument? 
 The fact of being on death row is cruel and unconstitutional. 
 Prisoners on death row, including those who say they are innocent, are, are abandoning appeals against execution because they can't take it any more. 
 Um, Javier Suarez Medina in Texas was asked on 11 occasions how he'd like his bodily remains disposed of. 
 Larry Lonchar in Georgia was 58 seconds away from execution when it was stayed. 
 This evidence is anecdotal. 
 The last ten executions in Florida, the condemned men have spent an average of 25 years on death row. 
 That's 25 years living in, in terrible conditions with terrible thoughts for company. 
 The solution to which would be modifying the environment rather than abolishing the death penalty. 
 Move on, Miss Cobbina. 
 It's racist. 
 Black people are more likely to be given the death sentence than white people, and that is hugely increased if the accused is black and the victim is white. 
 Men and women are on death row not because of the egregiousness of their crimes, but because of the colour of their skin. 
 Plus, the chances of being given the death sentence depend on on which state and in which county the crime is committed. 
 I mean, don't live in Waterbury County, Connecticut, if you're being tried for murder because, if you are, if you are convicted, you're near certain to die. 
 Geography was never what our founding fathers had in mind when determining who should die and who should be spared. 
 Bottom line, Ms Cobbina. The people decide. Not lawyers. 
 Not you and me with our data and statistics, but real people sitting as juries. 
 I know of no argument for reassigning the sacred duty of 12 jurors to lawyers. 
 Are you done? 
 No, no, I have one more argument. 
 Make it in the next two minutes. 
 Pain. 
 Excuse me? 
 The lethal injection is cruel and unconstitutional because of the pain it causes. 
 You have to show that the execution -- I'm quoting from Baze here -- ".. is sure or very likely to cause needless suffering." 
 Lethal injection is far and away the most humane and dignified method of execution. 
 North Korea uses anti-aircraft guns to execute enemies of the state. 
 Instant death. Saudi Arabia beheads people with razor-sharp swords -- one swipe and you're headless. 
 Albert Pierrepoint in dark old 1950s England could hang a man in eight seconds flat. 
 And we look down on them all for being brutal and inhumane, but none cause the kind of suffering that I saw Rudy Jones go through. 
 There's no conclusive evidence of pain in lethal injection procedure. 
 There's clear and profound disagreement amongst the experts on this. 
 The burden is on you to prove it. 
 You haven't discharged that burden on the evidence. 
 Justice Scarrow is right. You can't prove the pain. 
 That's because the medication hides everything. 
 That is the point of the three-drug cocktail. 
 So everything looks nice and clean and, and nobody is offended by what they're actually seeing. 
 You show us the evidence, fine. 
 But you can't, can you? 
 You can't do that. 
 I can. 
 The petitioner has had her 20 minutes and there's no provision for a live witness in the Supreme Court. 
 He's right. 
 You don't want to hear evidence from a man who is unique in American history in having experienced the lethal injection and survived it? 
 The rules here matter more than justice? 
 What, the highest court in the land doesn't have time for him? 
 He... he's waited 20 years for this. 
 The first three words of the Constitution of the United States -- "We the people." 
 Is Rudy Jones of the people or not? 
 I didn't want to make it easy because I didn't want to die. 
 I didn't want to die because I didn't do the crime I was being executed for. 
 I fought them because they were murdering me. 
 From the holding cell to the death cell to the strap-down in the death chamber, I was fighting for my life. 
 I didn't make a last statement, because that's a part of it, the sham that this is normal human behaviour. 
 That it isn't just profoundly shameful for the state to put men to death like dogs. 
 I was fighting and fighting, but then it started. 
 The pain was so bad, so intense. 
 I felt my dignity leave like a soul departing. 
 And then it got worse. 
 I-I couldn't move. 
 I couldn't speak. 
 I was entombed with the agony. 
 And then I couldn't breathe. 
 I went in fighting for my life... and spent the next 90 minutes... hoping to die. 
 You put a gun to the head of the elected mayor of Baton Rouge. 
 Oh, I wish I had. 
 I wish I had the courage. 
 But, no, sir. I did not. 
 Then who did? 
 You expect me to entrust the name of another human being to you, to this, knowing what I know about justice in this country? 
 I won't do it. 
 That's a contempt of court. 
 I think we've heard enough from you, Mr Livermore. 
 This was cruel and this was unusual, and anyone on this bench or in this courtroom who says it wasn't is inhuman and un-American. 
 Tell him I want to meet. 
 Who? 
 Brady. 
 You just missed him. 
 Oh. 
 Why? 
 To give him the full story. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Cos there's nothing left. 
 Well, it won't be the truth. It'll be self-serving. Can't imagine... 
 Only the truth. That's all it can be. 
 So why not here with me, now? 
 Because he's a hard-nosed b*st*rd and you are Maya's best friend. 
 Meaning...? 
 Meaning I don't trust you to do it. 
 That's a compliment, by the way. 
 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. Tell him to be there. 
 And tell him to keep himself hidden until I let him know it's clear to talk. 
 Tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow. 
 Dad? 
 I, er, I wanted to tell you something myself before you read about it in the paper. 
 OK. 
 You found your voice. 
 I guess. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I wanted to save it for here, so the Justices could hear it straight from me, straight from the pain. 
 You forgive me? 
 He deserved to die. 
 Are you still my dad? 
 Well, then it's OK. 
 It's OK. 
 Um, do you remember that, er, clearing in the woods...? 
 Where Rocco caught that pigeon? 
 Yeah, that's it. 
 Um, tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock I'm going to meet a reporter there called Alex Brady, and I'm going to tell him exactly what I've just told you. 
 And then what? 
 Well, er, then life can go on. 
 We can all go and live in Cornwall together? 
 And you and me, we could, we could go running? 
 Um, you mustn't tell anybody. 
 Now, I understand that might be hard. 
 No-one? 
 Would you like to tell someone? 
 Would, would that make it easier? 
 Yeah. 
 Er, what about your best friend? 
 Lola? 
 Yeah. 
 I promised her I'd tell her everything. 
 Oh, well, good. 
 OK. Thank you. 
 All right. Come on now. Time to get some sleep. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Lola. It's Dan. 
 There's something I want to tell you. 
 It's very important. 
 I'm back! 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Hello! 
 Dad's not here. He hasn't been here all morning. 
 Well, we saved Rudy. 
 Well done, Mummy. I knew you'd do it. 
 Dad should be here. Why is he not here? 
 I'm going to, I'm going to put my stuff upstairs. 
 I'll be down in a minute. 
 Mum? 
 'This is my story.' 
 'Story, I think, is the best word for anything autobiographical, because few of us can resist the temptation to make the rag-bag of incoherent happenings that make up a life into something meaningful, and before we know it and without us intending it, truth becomes fiction. We're all writers, really.' 
 'Remembering, for me, anyway, is not easy, because one life has become confused with another, and the second life, as you now know, had more than one life inside it.' 
 'Nevertheless, this is my best shot at the truth.' 
 'When you read this, your life will have become much more complicated, in order that it should become simpler sooner. I hope you will come to see that what I am about to do is an act of love. Look after Dan. His girlfriend is not what she seems.' 
 Police, please. There's going to be a murder. 
 Mum, is everything all right? 
 I have to tell you about Dad. 
 I have to tell you about me and Dad. 
 I don't understand. How could he? 
 You should ask him. 
 I can't. We can't, because he's gone. 
 I know where he is. 
 Where is he? 
 He told me not to tell anyone. 
 Where is he, Dan? 
 He's gone to tell a reporter the truth. 
 When? 
 In 15 minutes. 
 No. 14 minutes and 30 seconds. 
 He told you that? 
 And he told you not to tell anyone? 
 He says I can tell my best friend. 
 Who's your best friend? 
 My girlfriend. Lola. 
 I love her. 
 Dan... you have to tell me where Dad is. 
 It's very important. 
 You have to tell me. 
 He's in the forest. 
 Where Rocco caught the pigeon. 
 He said, when he's done, life can go on. 
 I'll take the front. 
 That's Dad's bike. Come on! 
 Oh, my God, Mum! Are you OK? 
 Dan, run! 
 Hold on to me. Are you all right? 
 NO! 
 NO! 
 No! No! 
 No! 
 Oh, Dan! 
 Armed police! Put the weapon down! Put the weapon down now! 
 Over here! 
 Step back from the weapon! 
 On your knees, on your knees. 
 You're going to be all right. You're going to be all right. 
 Hands on your head. 
 Keep your eyes open! 
 Danny! Danny! No!

 Maya, I can't. 
 Nick, the truth, just the truth. 
 He deserved to die. 
 Mayor Anderson. 
 Rudy? 
 Michael. 
 It was Michael?! 
 Maya! Mum? 
 Rudy told me to go big, and I tried, I really, really tried. 
 Yes, you did, yes, you did, my child. 
 But it wasn't enough. 
 Mum... 
 Maya... 
 Your help, your patience and your love. 
 I'm going to go bigger. 
 You can say it. 
 I'm here. 
 We're all here. 
 Say it now, and it will be a start. 
 Your name.
