 The kid's coming with me. 
 Who's he tracking? 
 The kid. 
 Then they’ll keep coming. 
 Yes. 
 Mando. 
 Is that you under that bucket? 
 Ran. 
 I didn't really know if I'd ever see you in these parts again. 
 Good to see you. 
 You know, to be honest, I was a little surprised when you reached out to me. 
 You know, 'cause I... I hear things. 
 Like, maybe things between you and the Guild aren't workin' out. 
 I'll be fine. 
 Okay. Well, you know the policy. 
 No questions. 
 And you, you're welcome back here anytime. 
 So, what's the job? 
 Yeah, one of our associates ran afoul of some competitors and got himself caught. 
 So, I'm puttin' together a crew to spring him. 
 It's a five person job. I got four. 
 All I need is the ride, and you brought it. 
 The ship wasn't part of the deal. 
 Well, the Crest is the only reason I let you back in here. 
 What's the look? 
 Is that gratitude? 
 Uh-huh. I think it is. 
 Hey, Mayfeld. 
 Yeah? 
 This is Mando, the guy I was tellin' you about. 
 We used to do jobs way back when. 
 This is the guy? 
 Yeah, we were all young, tryin' to make a name for ourselves. 
 Yeah, but runnin' with a Mandalorian, that was... 
 That brought us some reputation. 
 Oh, yeah? What did he get out of it? 
 I asked him that one time. You remember what you said, Mando? 
 Target practice. 
 Target practice. 
 We did some crazy stuff, didn't we? 
 That was a long time ago. 
 Well... 
 Well, I don't go out anymore. You understand? 
 So, uh, Mayfeld, he's gonna run point on this job. 
 If he says it, it's like it's comin' from me. 
 You good with that? 
 You tell me. 
 You haven't changed one bit. 
 Yeah, well, things have changed around here. 
 Yeah, well, Mayfeld, he's... 
 He's one of the best triggermen I've ever seen. 
 Former Imperial sharpshooter. 
 That's not saying much. 
 I wasn't a stormtrooper, wiseass. 
 Don't take long, does it? 
 Razor Crest? I can't believe that thing can fly. 
 Looks like a Canto Bight slot machine. 
 The good-lookin' fellow there with the horns, that's Burg. 
 This may surprise you, but he's our muscle. 
 So, this is a Mandalorian. 
 I thought they'd be bigger. 
 Droid's name is Zero. 
 I thought you said you had four. 
 He does. 
 Hello, Mando. 
 Xi'an. 
 Tell me why I shouldn't cut you down where you stand? 
 Nice to see you, too. 
 I missed you. 
 This is shiny. 
 You wear it well. 
 Do we need to leave the room or something? 
 Well, Xi'an's been a little heartbroken since Mando left our group. 
 Aw. You gonna be okay, sweetheart? 
 Oh, I'm all business now. 
 Learned from the best. 
 All right, lovebirds. 
 Break it up till you get on the ship. Right now we don't have much time. 
 Tiny. 
 Fuel. 
 Navigation. Hyperdrive. 
 Landing gear. 
 Comms. 
 Mando... 
 I received... I received wonderful news. 
 Upon your... Upon your... Deliver the quarry. Deliver the... 
 Hmm. 
 So, the package is being moved on a fortified transport ship. 
 Now, we got a limited window to board, find our friend, get him out of there before they make their jump. 
 That's a New Republic prison ship. 
 Your man wasn't taken by a rival syndicate. He was arrested. 
 So what? 
 A job is a job. 
 That's a max security transport and I'm not looking for that kinda heat. 
 Well, neither are we. So just don't mess up. 
 The good news for you is the ship is manned by droids. 
 Still hate the machines, Mando? 
 Despite recent modifications, the ship is still quite a mess. 
 The power lines are leaking, the navigation is intermittent, and the hyperdrive is only operating at 67.3% efficiency. 
 We have much better ships. Why are we using this one? 
 'Cause the Razor Crest is off the old Imperial and the New Republic grid. 
 It's a ghost. 
 Yeah, and we need a ship that can get close enough to jam New Republic code. 
 So, when we drop out of hyperspace here, if we immediately bank into this kinda attitude, we should be right in their blind spot, which will give us just enough time for your ship to scramble our signal. 
 It's not possible. Even for the Crest. 
 That's why he's flyin'. 
 Mando, I know you're a pretty good pilot, but we need you on the trigger. Not on the wheel. 
 Don't worry, Mandalorian. 
 My response time is quicker than organics. And I'm smarter, too. 
 All right. I... Yeah. That's good. 
 Forgive the programming. He's a little rough around the edges. 
 But he is the best. 
 How can you trust it? 
 You know me, Mando. I don't trust anybody. 
 Just like the good old days, Mando. Huh? 
 Will you sit down? 
 Calculations complete. 
 Jumping to hyperspace now. 
 Feel free to join the others. I will handle it from here. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Okay. Okay, I get it. 
 I'm a little particular about my personal space, too. 
 So, let's just do this job. 
 We get in, we get out, and you don't have to see our faces anymore. 
 Someone tell me why we even need a Mandalorian. 
 Well, apparently they're the greatest warriors in the galaxy. 
 So they say. 
 Then why are they all dead? 
 Well, you flew with him, Xi'an. 
 Is he as good as they say? 
 Ask him about the job on Alzoc III. 
 I did what I had to. 
 Oh, but you liked it. 
 See, I know who you really are. 
 He never takes off the helmet? 
 This is the Way. 
 Huh. 
 I wonder what you look like under there. 
 Maybe he's a Gungan. 
 Is that why yousa don't wanna show your face? 
 You ever seen his face? 
 A lady never tells. 
 Aw. Come on, Mando. We all gotta trust each other here. 
 You gotta show us somethin'. 
 Come on. Just lift the helmet up. 
 Come on. 
 Let's all see your eyes. 
 I'll do it. 
 Whoa! What is that? 
 You get lonely up here, buddy? Huh? 
 Wait a minute. Did you two make that? Huh? 
 What is it, like a pet or somethin'? 
 Yeah. Something like that. 
 Didn't take you for the type. 
 Maybe that code of yours has made you soft. 
 Me, I was never really into pets. 
 Yeah, I didn't have the temperament. Patience, you know? 
 I mean, I tried, but never worked out. 
 But I'm thinkin' maybe I'll try again with this little fella. 
 Huh? 
 Dropping out of hyperspace now. 
 Commencing final approach, now. 
 Cloaking signal, now. 
 Engaging coupling now. 
 Coupling confirmed. We are down. 
 And relax. 
 Commence extraction now. 
 Useless droid didn't even give us a proper countdown. 
 Z, are you sure they can't see us? 
 The Razor Crest is scrambling our signature and I am inside the prison system. 
 It's impressive that this gunship had survived the Empire without being impounded. 
 All right, we got a job to do. Mando, you're up. 
 It's me? Always you. 
 Zero. 
 Get us to the control room. 
 Sub level three. Disabling onboard surveillance. 
 All right, we're on the clock. 
 Second we engage those droids, they're gonna be all over us. 
 I know the drill. 
 Bio trackers activated. 
 I've got eyes. 
 All right, let's go. 
 I don't like this. You always were paranoid. 
 Is that true, Mando? Were you always paranoid? 
 Approaching control room. Make a left at the next juncture. 
 What? It's just a little mousey. 
 Come here, little mousey. Burg. 
 Mousey, come here. Come here. Burg. 
 No! Burg, what are you doin'? 
 What? 
 Intruder alert. Open fire. 
 We're too exposed here. 
 If they get a signal out, it's not gonna matter. 
 Mando, let's go! You're supposed to be somethin' special. 
 I knew it. I knew it! 
 Make sure you clean up your mess. 
 It seems your presence has been detected. 
 Redirecting security alert away from your position. 
 Z, open the door! 
 But I'm detecting an organic signature. 
 Yeah, okay. All right. Just open the door! 
 Stop! 
 Just stop right there. 
 You put down the blasters right now. 
 Nice shoes. 
 Put down your blasters. 
 Matches his belt. 
 There were only supposed to be droids on this ship. 
 Hang on, hang on. Let's see here. Uh... 
 Cell two-two-one. 
 All right, now for our well-dressed friend. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Easy. Easy, egghead. 
 Put that down. Put that down. Come on. 
 Easy. Put it down now! 
 Easy. Nobody has to get hurt here. Just calm down. 
 What is that thing? 
 It's a tracking beacon. 
 He presses that thing, we're all done. 
 A New Republic attack team will hone in on that signal and blow us all to hell. 
 Put it down! 
 
 
 
 Are you serious? 
 Yes, I'm serious. 
 You didn't think we needed to know that tiny little detail? 
 I didn't think we'd get to this point. 
 Yet here we are. 
 Are you questioning my managerial style, Xi'an? 
 No, sir. 
 Hey. Listen to me. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, okay? 
 Look. 
 Hey. Put it down. Are you crazy? 
 Put it down. 
 What's your name? 
 It's Davan. Davan. 
 We're not here for you. We're here for a prisoner. 
 If you let us go about our job, you can walk away with your life. 
 No, he won't. 
 Hey. 
 You realize what you're gonna bring down on us? 
 You think I care about that? 
 We're not killing anybody. You understand? 
 Get that blaster out of my face, Mando. 
 I can't do that. 
 Get that blaster out of my face, Mando! 
 Don't. 
 Would you both just shut up? 
 Crazy Twi. 
 I had it under control. 
 Yeah. Looked like it. 
 Was that thing blinking before? 
 Was it? 
 Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld. What? 
 I've detected a New Republic distress signal homing in on your location. 
 You have approximately 20 minutes. 
 We only need five. 
 Let's go, let's go. Move, move, move, move! 
 Z, open it up. 
 You have 15 minutes remaining. Come on, come on. Open it up! 
 Qin. 
 Funny, the man who left me behind is now my savior. 
 Mando. 
 Brother! Sister. 
 Attack's on the way. He's already dead meat. Let's go! 
 Come on, it's better this way. 
 You deserve this! 
 Let's go! 
 Mando. Mando? 
 I've received your transmission. I've received your transmission. 
 Upon your return, deliver the quarry directly to the client. 
 I have no idea... Interesting. 
 Zero, we got Qin. 
 I found some information on The Mandalorian. 
 From the Bounty Hunters Guild. 
 Yeah, do whatever. Just get us off this ship. 
 You have 10 minutes remaining. 
 Zero to Mayfeld. Zero to Mayfeld. Wait, wait, wait! 
 Yeah? You have a potential problem. 
 He has escaped. 
 I told you we should've ended him. I know! 
 This is your fault! I know! 
 Go! Go, go, go! Come on! 
 No! No! 
 No! Burg! Burg! 
 Zero to Mayfeld. Mayfeld, do you copy? 
 It seems comms are no longer functioning, therefore you cannot hear me. 
 You are on your own. 
 Curious. 
 It's all right. You and the Devaronian, split up. 
 Find Mando and kill him. 
 Then find a way back to the ship! 
 Zero! We need a path. 
 Zero! 
 Do you have a name? 
 Mayfeld. 
 Well, Mr. Mayfeld, you're gonna get me the hell off this ship. 
 Hey, wait. What about your sister? 
 What about her? 
 Nice family. 
 Mando always did hate droids. 
 Z? 
 Z? 
 Hey, hey. 
 Whatever Ran promised, I'll see to it you get triple share. 
 Just get him. 
 You better be good for it. 
 Mando. 
 Where are you, little mouse? 
 Let's see your face, Mandalorian. 
 Zero, where is he? 
 What the... 
 No! 
 Qin. 
 You killed the others. 
 They got what they deserved. 
 You kill me, you don't get your money. 
 Whatever Ran promised, I'll make sure you get it, and more. 
 Come on, Mando. 
 Be reasonable. 
 Huh? 
 You were hired to do a job, right? 
 So do it. 
 Isn't that your code? 
 Aren't you a man of honor? 
 Where are the others? 
 No questions asked. That's the policy, right? 
 Yeah. That is the policy. 
 I did the job. 
 Yeah, you did. 
 Just like the good old days. 
 Yeah, just like the good old days. 
 Kill him. 
 What's this? 
 That b*st*rd. 
 I got a clear signal on the tracking beacon. 
 Copy that. 
 Are those X-wings? 
 Yep. That's definitely a tracking beacon. 
 Looks like they're launching a gunship. 
 Copy. Goin' in. 
 I told you that was a bad idea.
