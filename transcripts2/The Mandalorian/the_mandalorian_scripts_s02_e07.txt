 You have something I want. 
 It means more to me   than you will ever know. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: The Child is gone. 
 Until he is returned to you safely, we are in your debt. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Cara Dune, Marshal of the New Republic. 
 I need you to locate someone in the prison registry. 
 Ex-Imperial sharpshooter, last name Mayfeld. 
 Serving    years in the Karthon Chop Fields. 
 Accessory to the death of a New Republic officer. 
 Get that blaster out of my face, Mando! 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Realize what you'll bring down on us? 
 You think I care about that? 
 - Get that blaster out of my face. 
 - THE MANDALORIAN: I can't do that. 
 Crazy Twi. 
 (ALARM BLARING) 
 No! 
 (MACHINERY WHIRRING) 
 DROID: Inmate three-four-six-six-seven. 
 Inmate three-four-six-six-seven. 
 (GROANS) 
 What? 
 What? 
 DROID: Inmate three-four-six-six-seven, descend and receive new instructions. 
 Can't you see I'm busy? 
 Inmate three-four-six-six-seven, please salute Marshal Dune. 
 I remand prisoner number three-four-six-six-seven to my custody. 
 Affirmative. 
 Inmate three-four-six-six-seven, please follow Marshal Dune to transport. 
 Somebody gonna tell me what's going on? 
 Let's go! 
 I've got a job for you. 
 DROID: Inmate three-four-six-six-seven, please follow Marshal Dune. 
 Wait, where is she takin' me? 
 Inmate three-four-six-six-seven, you have three seconds to comply with your new directive. 
 Okay! 
 All right, all right. 
 Hey! 
 You gonna tell me where you're takin' me? 
 Hello? 
 I mean, it's a common courtesy, a common courtesy to tell somebody where it is that you're takin' 'em. 
 I don't think that's so hard to ask, do you? 
 Oh. 
 You know, for a second, I thought you were this other guy. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Mayfeld. 
 Hey, Mando. 
 Long time. 
 What, you came here to kill me? 
 All you need to know is I bent a lot of rules to bring you along. 
 Why am I so lucky? 
 Because you're Imperial. 
 Hey, that was a long time ago, all right? 
 THE MANDALORIAN: You still know your Imperial clearances and protocols, don't you? 
 (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 We need coordinates for Moff Gideon's cruiser. 
 Moff Gideon? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Yeah, forget it. 
 Just take me back to the scrapyard. 
 I'm not doin' that. 
 They have his kid. 
 The little green guy? 
 Yeah, "The little green guy." So... 
 I help you guys get him back, you guys let me go? 
 That's not how this works. 
 Well, then what's in it for me? 
 You get a better view. 
 All right, but here's the thing. 
 I can't get those coordinates unless I have access to an internal Imperial terminal. 
 I believe there's one on Morak. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Morak? 
 There's nothing on Morak. 
 It's a secret Imperial mining hub, okay? 
 If you can get me in there, I can get you the coordinates. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Fett, punch in the coordinates to Morak. 
 BOBA FETT: Copy that. 
 I did an initial scan of the planet. 
 This is what you're talkin' about, right? 
 Yeah, that's the refinery right there. 
 Wonder what they're refining in there. 
 Looks like rhydonium. 
 Highly volatile and explosive. 
 Yeah, kinda like this one, huh. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 They have anti-aircraft cannons protecting it. 
 And a platoon of security forces. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: So we go in quiet. 
 Let's go get a closer look. 
 MAYFELD: I'm not gonna need long inside, so once I get the coordinates, you guys gotta get me the hell out of there. 
 BOBA FETT: You get to the roof. 
 I'll drop in and pull you out. 
 All right. 
 Mayfeld and I will swap out for the drivers in the tunnel. 
 As much as I'd like to take a road trip with Rebel-dropper here, that's not gonna work. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Why's that? 
 Well, because these Remnant bases are set up and run by ex-ISB. 
 If you get scanned and your genetic signature shows up on any New Republic register, you're gonna be detected, and it's guns out. 
 You sure do know a lot about Imperial Remnants. 
 If you wanna accuse me of something, then just say it. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: We don't have time. 
 Fennec will go. 
 No, I'm wanted by the ISB. 
 I'll trip the alarm, too. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Fett? 
 BOBA FETT: Let's just say they might recognize my face. 
 MAYFELD: Great, so it's me goin' in alone. 
 CARA: No way. 
 The minute he gets inside, he'll tip 'em off. 
 He'll be a hero. 
 MAYFELD: Hey. 
 This wasn't my idea. 
 I'm doin' you guys a favor. 
 CARA: Deal's off. 
 I'm takin' him back. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: I'll go. 
 Hey, buddy, I might be good at fast-talking, but I don't think I can explain away a guy in a Mando suit to Imperial guards. 
 So, unless you're gonna take off that helmet, it's gonna be me goin' in alone. 
 Or say goodbye to your little green friend. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: You're not going alone. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 But I won't be showing my face. 
 PILOT  : Refinery, this is Juggernaut Five entering tunnel T-  . 
 WOMAN: (OVER COMMS) 
 Copy that, Juggernaut Five. 
 Juggernaut Four has reached the north exit. 
 You're all clear. 
 (MAYFELD GRUNTS) 
 PILOT  : What the... 
 (ALL GRUNTING) 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Oh, my God, this guy reeked. 
 His gloves are still wet. 
 Ugh! 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Look at this. 
 Oh, the shame. 
 Now, that right there is worth the price of admission. 
 Wish I could say it looked good on you, but I'd be lying. 
 Just make sure you take out the rooftop gunners, or we're never getting out of here. 
 We got you. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Take care of this. 
 Keep it safe. 
 I will. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Still on the clock. 
 What would they say on Mandalore? 
 It's a shame you're not comin' along with us. 
 You got such a sunny disposition. 
 Can't imagine how much fun you are in one of these. 
 What's goin' on here? 
 Power coil, motivator... 
 Oh, there we... 
 - (ENGINE WHIRRING) 
 - Ah, there we go. 
 There we go! 
 And we are off. 
 Hey, how's it feel? 
 Huh? 
 I mean, c'mon, man, you still get to wear a helmet, right? 
 All right, you know what? 
 I'm takin' this thing off. 
 I can't see anything. 
 I don't know how you people wear those things. 
 And by "you people," I do mean Mandalorians. 
 Phase one, complete. 
 We're in. 
 BOBA FETT: (OVER COMMS) 
 Copy. 
 Standing by. 
 Feels better when it's off. 
 MAN  : (OVER COMMS) 
 Juggernaut Four, you're running hot. 
 Be sure to watch your cargo heat limits and speed. 
 PILOT  : Copy that, Three. 
 We hit a couple bumps. 
 Thanks for the heads-up. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Don't worry about the rhydonium. 
 As long as you drive steady, you'll get us to the refinery. 
 (HORN BLARES) 
 WOMAN  : Go, go! 
 - MAN: Out of the road. 
 Go! 
 - WOMAN  : Get to safety! 
 Yeah. 
 Empire, New Republic. 
 It's all the same to these people. 
 Invaders on their land is all we are. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 MAYFELD: I'm just sayin', somewhere someone in this galaxy is ruling and others are being ruled. 
 I mean, look at your race. 
 Do you think all those people that died in wars fought by Mandalorians actually had a choice? 
 So how are they any different than the Empire? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 If you were born on Mandalore, you believe one thing, if you're born on Alderaan, you believe somethin' else. 
 But guess what? 
 Neither one of 'em exist anymore. 
 Hey, I'm just a realist. 
 I'm a survivor, just like you. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Let's get one thing straight. 
 You and I are nothing alike. 
 I don't know. 
 Seems to me like your rules start to change when you get desperate. 
 I mean, look at ya. 
 You said you couldn't take your helmet off, and now you got a stormtrooper one on, so what's the rule? 
 Is it that you can't take off your Mando helmet, or you can't show your face? 
 'Cause there is a difference. 
 Look, I'm just sayin', we're all the same. 
 Everybody's got their lines they don't cross until things get messy. 
 As far as I'm concerned, if you can make it through your day and still sleep at night, you're doin' better than most. 
 PILOT  : (OVER COMMS) 
 Control, this is Juggernaut Three. 
 We're comin' up on some route interference. 
 Control, control! 
 We need a new... 
 (SCREAMS) 
 What was that? 
 WOMAN: Please stand by for reroute. 
 (DISTANT EXPLOSIONS) 
 Juggernaut Four has been destroyed. 
 "Destroyed"? 
 THE MANDALORIAN: The rhydonium is still stable. 
 WOMAN: Juggernaut Five, maintain speed and course. 
 Proceed with caution. 
 - Re-routing course, stand by. 
 - "Proceed with caution"? 
 Is she serious? 
 PILOT  : Control, this is Juggernaut Three. 
 Requesting... 
 Abort! 
 Abort! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (MAYFELD GRUNTING) 
 (PIRATES SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 What the hell was that? 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Pirates. 
 Keep driving. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 Are you seriously shooting a blaster near rhydonium? 
 - (THE MANDALORIAN SIGHS) 
 - (PIRATES SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 THE MANDALORIAN: They've thermal detonators. 
 - MAYFELD: Terrific. 
 - Just keep it steady. 
 MAYFELD: Get these guys off us! 
 Get 'em off us! 
 Ah! 
 (CHUCKLES AND GRUNTS) 
 (PIRATES SCREAM) 
 - (GRUNTING) 
 - (ALARM BLARING) 
 - They're trying to blow the rhydonium. 
 - You think? 
 You should've left me in prison! 
 (PIRATES YELLING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 (ALL YELLING) 
 - (GRUNTS) 
 - (SHOUTS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 (BLASTER CLICKING) 
 (PIRATES YELLING) 
 (ALL GRUNTING) 
 (PIRATE SCREAMING) 
 (THUDDING) 
 - (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 - (THE MANDALORIAN GRUNTING) 
 (PIRATE SCREAMS) 
 (YELLING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Mayfeld! 
 Pick it up. 
 Drive faster! 
 (PIRATES SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 (ALARM BLARING) 
 I don't think faster's a good idea! 
 THE MANDALORIAN: What are you doing? 
 (ALARM STOPS) 
 (PIRATE SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 (PIRATES YELLING AND GROWLING) 
 (ALL GRUNTING) 
 (PIRATE YELPING) 
 (THERMAL DETONATOR BEEPING) 
 (SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 (ALL GRUNTING) 
 (PIRATES YELLING AND SCREAMING) 
 (ALL SCREAMING) 
 (RATTLING) 
 Uh, Mando, I gotta stop. 
 I can't cross at this speed. 
 (GROANING AND PANTING) 
 (PIRATES YELLING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 (THERMAL DETONATORS BEEPING) 
 (PIRATES LAUGHING AND SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) 
 (SIGHS AND GRUNTS) 
 (PIRATES YELLING) 
 - Whoo! 
 - (PIRATES SCREAMING) 
 STORMTROOPER LEADER: Go! 
 
 
 
 Go! 
 Stay on high alert! 
 - Fire! 
 On your right! 
 - (PIRATES SCREAMING) 
 (THE MANDALORIAN GROANING) 
 Never thought you'd be happy to see stormtroopers. 
 STORMTROOPER  : Here they are. 
 They made it. 
 - STORMTROOPER  : Yes! 
 - (STORMTROOPERS CHEERING) 
 - STORMTROOPER  : Glory of the Empire! 
 - (CHEERING CONTINUES) 
 STORMTROOPER  : There we go! 
 Okay. 
 All we gotta do is find a terminal. 
 MAN: Ya did it! 
 SHORETROOPER: Bringing glory to the Empire! 
 MAYFELD: It's probably in the officers' mess. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 STORMTROOPER  : I can't believe they pulled that off. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 There it is. 
 - Okay. 
 - THE MANDALORIAN: Good luck. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 - I can't go in there. 
 - THE MANDALORIAN: Why not? 
 - That's Valin Hess. 
 - Who? 
 It's Valin Hess. 
 I used to serve under him. 
 - Will he recognize you? 
 - MAYFELD: I don't know. 
 I was just a field operative, but I'm not takin' the chance. 
 It's over. 
 Let's just do this quick and we can get out of here. 
 I can't do it, okay? 
 We have to abort. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No. 
 I can't. 
 If we don't get those coordinates, I'll lose the kid forever. 
 - Give me the data stick. 
 - It's not gonna work. 
 In order to access the network, the terminal has to scan your face. 
 Let's go. 
 Give it to me. 
 AUTOMATED VOICE: Error, error. 
 Facial scan incomplete. 
 Ten seconds to system shutdown. 
 Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... 
 Facial scan complete. 
 (SYSTEM WHIRRING) 
 Trooper! 
 - Hey, trooper. 
 - (SYSTEM BEEPS) 
 Pay attention when a superior addresses you. 
 What's your designation? 
 Transport crew. 
 What? 
 My designation is transport copilot. 
 VALIN HESS: No, son. 
 What's your TK number? 
 - My TK number is... 
 - Uh-huh. 
 This is my Commanding Officer TK-   , sir. 
 I'm Imperial Combat Assault Transport Lieutenant TK-   , sir. 
 I'm afraid you'll have to speak up to him a little bit since his vessel lost pressure in Taanab. 
 (LOUDLY) 
 What's your name, Officer? 
 We just call him Brown Eyes. 
 Isn't that right, Officer? 
 Let's go fill out those TPS reports, so we can go recharge the power coils. 
 VALIN HESS: You're not dismissed. 
 You the tank troopers that delivered the shipment of rhydonium? 
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 Well, you two managed to be the only transport today to deliver their shipment. 
 Come with me, hmm? 
 Let's get a drink, Brown Eyes. 
 CARA: We'll have to take out those cannons if Boba's gonna get close enough to lift 'em outta there. 
 FENNEC SHAND: Shouldn't be a problem. 
 You concentrate on the troopers, I'll take the cannons. 
 I wonder what's takin' them so long. 
 VALIN HESS: So what shall we toast to, boys? 
 I can blather on about "To health" or "To success," but I'd like to do somethin' a little less rote. 
 Where you from, Brown Eyes? 
 How 'bout a toast to Operation Cinder? 
 Now there's a man who knows his history. 
 No, I don't just know it. 
 I lived it. 
 I was in Burnin Konn. 
 - Burnin Konn? 
 - MAYFELD: Mmm. 
 That was a hard day. 
 I had to make many unpleasant decisions. 
 Yes, you did. 
 Entire city gone in moments, along with everybody in it. 
 We lost our whole division that day. 
 Man, that was like  -  ,    people. 
 Yep. 
 All heroes of the Empire. 
 Yeah. 
 And all dead. 
 VALIN HESS: Well, it's a small sacrifice for the greater good, son. 
 Depends on who you ask, don't you think? 
 What you gettin' at, trooper? 
 All those people, the ones who died, was it good for them? 
 Hmm? 
 Their families? 
 The guys I served with? 
 Civilians, those poor mud scuffers, died defendin' their homes, fighting for freedom. 
 Was it good for 'em? 
 But we've outlasted them, son. 
 They're eatin' themselves alive. 
 The New Republic is in complete disarray, and we grow stronger. 
 You see, with the rhydonium you've delivered, we can create havoc that's gonna make Burnin Konn just pale by comparison. 
 And then they're gonna turn to us once again. 
 You see, boys, everybody thinks they want freedom, but what they really want is order. 
 And when they realize that, they're gonna welcome us back with open arms. 
 Ah. 
 To the Empire. 
 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
 You did what you had to do. 
 I never saw your face. 
 ANNOUNCER: (OVER SPEAKER) 
 Security to main commons. 
 (STORMTROOPERS SCREAMING) 
 MAYFELD: This way! 
 SHORETROOPER: We need support at the mess hall. 
 - (OFFICER GRUNTS) 
 - THE MANDALORIAN: Ready? 
 Go! 
 - (MAYFELD GRUNTS) 
 - SHORETROOPER  : Hold it right there! 
 - (SHORETROOPER GRUNTS) 
 - South wall, halfway up. 
 Got 'em. 
 (GRUNTS AND SCREAMS) 
 (STORMTROOPERS GRUNTING) 
 We're on. 
 Start your run. 
 BOBA FETT: On my way. 
 (MAYFELD GRUNTING) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GUNNERS GRUNTING) 
 Three shooters, top deck. 
 Got 'em. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (BOTH GRUNTING) 
 - THE MANDALORIAN: Let's move. 
 - MAYFELD: The hell you think I'm doin'? 
 - (MAYFELD GRUNTING) 
 - (STORMTROOPER SCREAMS) 
 MAYFELD: Go! 
 Go! 
 Go! 
 Go! 
 (STORMTROOPERS GRUNTING) 
 (STORMTROOPERS SCREAMING) 
 (THE MANDALORIAN GRUNTS) 
 (MAYFELD SCREAMS AND GRUNTS) 
 Hand me that cycler rifle. 
 (GUN FIRES) 
 Nice shot. 
 Huh. 
 We all need to sleep at night. 
 (RADAR BEEPING) 
 BOBA FETT: We got company. 
 Hang on. 
 (THE MANDALORIAN GRUNTING) 
 Well, looks like it's back to the scrap heap. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Thank you for helping. 
 MAYFELD: Yeah. 
 Uh, good luck gettin' your kid back. 
 All right, Officer, take me back. 
 That was some nice shootin' back there. 
 Oh, you saw that? 
 Yeah, that, uh, that wasn't part of the plan. 
 I was just gettin' some stuff off my chest. 
 You know, it's too bad Mayfeld didn't make it out alive back there. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Yeah, too bad. 
 What are you talkin' about? 
 Looked to me like prisoner number three-four-six-six-seven died in the refinery explosion on Morak. 
 Does that mean I can go? 
 Huh? 
 'Cause I will. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 You get the coordinates on Moff Gideon? 
 We did. 
 What's our next move? 
 Sir... 
 You should see this. 
 THE MANDALORIAN: Moff Gideon. 
 You have something I want. 
 You may think you have some idea what you are in possession of, but you do not. 
 Soon, he will be back with me. 
 He means more to me than you will ever know.
