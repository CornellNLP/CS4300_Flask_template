 There is one job. 
 Underworld? 
 Face to face. 
 Bounty hunting is a complicated profession. 
 Proof of termination is also acceptable for a lower fee. 
 My ship has been destroyed. I'm trapped here. 
 These are my parts. They stole them from me. 
 You can trade. 
 The egg? What egg? 
 Mando. I've received your transmission. Wonderful news. 
 Upon your return, deliver the quarry directly to the client. 
 I have no idea if he wants to eat it or hang it on his wall, but he's very antsy. 
 Safe passage! You know where to find me. 
 It's not a toy. 
 Easy with that. 
 You take it easy. 
 Yes! 
 Yes, yes, yes! 
 Yes. 
 Very healthy. Yes. 
 Your reputation was not unwarranted. 
 How many fobs did you give out? 
 This asset was of extreme importance to me. 
 I had to ensure its delivery. 
 But to the winner... 
 Go the spoils. 
 Such a large bounty for such a small package. 
 What are your plans for it? 
 How uncharacteristic of one of your reputation. 
 You have taken both commission and payment. 
 Is it not the Code of the Guild that these events are now forgotten? 
 That Beskar is enough to make a handsome replacement for your armor. 
 Unfortunately, finding a Mandalorian in these trying times is more difficult than finding the steel. 
 This amount can be shaped many ways. 
 My armor has lost its integrity. I may need to begin again. 
 Indeed. I can form a full cuirass. 
 This would be in order for your station. 
 That would be a great honor. 
 I must warn you. It will draw many eyes. 
 These were cast in an Imperial smelter. 
 These are the spoils of the Great Purge. 
 The reason that we live hidden like sand rats. 
 Our secrecy is our survival. Our survival is our strength. 
 Our strength was once in our numbers. 
 Now we live in the shadows and only come above ground one at a time. 
 Our world was shattered by the Empire, with whom this coward shares tables. 
 The Empire is no longer. 
 And the Beskar has returned. 
 When one chooses to walk the Way of the Mandalore, you are both hunter and prey. 
 How can one be a coward if one chooses this way of life? 
 Have you ever removed your helmet? 
 No. 
 Has it ever been removed by others? 
 Never. 
 This is the Way. 
 This is the Way. 
 This is the Way. 
 What caused this damage? 
 A Mudhorn. 
 Then you have earned the Mudhorn as your signet. 
 I shall craft it. 
 I can't accept. It wasn't a noble kill. 
 I was helped by an enemy. 
 Why would an enemy help you in battle? 
 It did not know it was my enemy. 
 Since you forgo a signet, I shall use the excess to forge whistling birds. 
 Whistling birds will do well. 
 Reserve some for the foundlings. 
 As it should always be. The foundlings are the future. 
 This is the Way. 
 This is the Way. 
 This is the Way. 
 Whistling birds are a powerful defense against multiple enemies. 
 Use them sparingly, for they are rare. 
 Look, I told you. I'm not interested in your excuses! 
 You had your shot, dust breather, but you failed. 
 No pucks for you. Now get outta here. 
 Ah! Mando! 
 They all hate you, Mando. Because you're a legend! 
 How many of them had tracking fobs? 
 All of them. All of them! But not one of them closed the deal. 
 Only you, Mando. Only you. 
 And with it, the richest reward this parsec has ever seen. 
 Please sit, my friend. 
 They're all weighing the Beskar in their minds, but not me. 
 No. I, for one, I celebrate your success. 
 Because it is my success as well. 
 Hell! Even I am rich. 
 Now, how can I show my gratitude to my most valuable partner? 
 I want my next job. 
 Next job? 
 Take some time off. Enjoy yourself. 
 I'll take you to the Twi'lek healing baths. 
 I want my next job. 
 Sure. Fine. 
 You hunters like to keep busy, right? 
 Well, these are all far away. 
 The further, the better. 
 Well, take your pick. You've earned it. 
 Ah. That's the best one of the lot. A nobleman's son skipped bail. 
 Looks like you're headed to the ocean dunes of Karnac. 
 Any idea what they're gonna do with it? 
 With what? 
 The kid. 
 I didn't ask. It's against the Guild Code. 
 They work for the Empire. What are they doing here? 
 The Empire is gone, Mando. 
 
 
 
 All that are left are mercenaries and warlords. 
 But if it bothers you, just go back to the Core and report them to the New Republic. 
 That's a joke. 
 Mando, enjoy your rewards. 
 Buy a camtono of spice. 
 By the time you come out of hyperdrive, you will have forgotten all about it. 
 I don't care. 
 I order you to extract the necessary material and be done with it. 
 He has explicitly ordered us to bring it back alive. 
 Finish your business quickly, as I no longer can guarantee your safety. 
 Check the perimeter. 
 No, no, no, no, please. Please. No. No, no. 
 No, please. 
 Please don't hurt him. It's just a child. 
 Please. No. No! Please. No. No, no. 
 What did you do to it? What did you do it? 
 I protected him. I protected him. 
 If it wasn't for me, he would already be dead! 
 Please! Please. Please. 
 Look, there! 
 Split up. We'll flush him out. 
 Copy. 
 Give it up. There's nowhere to... 
 Hey! 
 Freeze! 
 Don't move. 
 Hands up. 
 Drop the blaster. 
 Wait. What I'm holding is very valuable. 
 Here. 
 Now turn and face me. 
 Stand up! 
 Welcome back, Mando! 
 Now put the package down. 
 Step aside. I'm going to my ship. 
 You put the bounty down and perhaps I'll let you pass. 
 The kid's coming with me. 
 If you truly care about the kid, then you'll put it on the speeder and we'll discuss terms. 
 How do I know I can trust you? 
 Because I'm your only hope. 
 Drive. 
 Drive! 
 That's one impressive weapon! 
 Here's what I'll do. 
 I'm gonna walk to my ship with the kid and you're gonna let it happen. 
 No. How about this? 
 We take the kid, and if you try to stop us, we kill you and we strip your body for parts. 
 Don't hit the target! 
 Get out of here! We'll hold them off! 
 You're going to have to relocate the covert. 
 This is the Way. 
 This is the Way. 
 Hold it, Mando. 
 I didn't want it to come to this. 
 But then you broke the Code. 
 I gotta get one of those.
