 Um, my brother and Candace invited us over tonight. 
 She asked me to bring something, so I thought I'd make a Jell-O mold. 
 But I have to stop by the market, and pick up some mayonnaise. 
 But I know you like that and so does Candace, so... 
 Can you get the radio? I want to hear the weather. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Man : It's New Year's Eve, New York. 
 Be safe out there tonight. 
 But right now, we've got one more song, and then we'll have traffic and the weather.

 There are only seven names here. 
 There are only seven editors at the top 20 papers who have a magazine background. 
 They're all over 50. 
 Steve Tilton from the Dallas Morning News isn't. 
 He's 49. 
 It's the 1970s. 
 I need someone who can still get a hard-on. 
 You said you wanted "sophisticated "with management chops and a strong sense of narrative." 
 Doesn't say anything here about tumescence. 
 I never thought I'd ask this, but find out who's restless over at "Time." 
 Sure. 
 Good word, tumescence. 
 Good morning, Viv. 
 Good morning. 
 I'd like you to distribute the new desk calendars. 
 I'm... I'm on my way to the little girls room. 
 Okay, well, after that. 
 Go ahead. 
 Here's my resume, Patti. 
 I don't want to get a typewriter thrown at my head. 
 The second we file this complaint, they can't fire us. 
 I hope you're right. 
 I am. 
 I am. 
 Thank you so much for spearheading this, Patti. 
 No, it's all of us. 
 So what's next? 
 Next, we party. 
 Do you want to go to the Chelsea? 
 I wouldn't miss it. 
 I hear people run around naked in the halls there. 
 I'm counting you in. 
 No, not me, I... 
 I'm still in mourning. 
 Peter broke up with her. 
 Reporters don't break up with you. 
 They just take a posting in Moscow. 
 I thought you were going with him. 
 Me, too. 
 Look, all the more reason for you to come out. 
 You don't have to think about him all night. 
 How do you think I'm getting over Doug? 
 Dottie brought another dress. 
 I can never make up my mind. 
 I would just be a wet blanket. 
 Come on. 
 Oh, she said no, Patti. 
 Come on, Diane. There are fresh doughnuts in the break room. 
 That'll help. 
 Do you really think going to a party is gonna help you get over Doug? 
 Yeah. That and some other things I'm trying. 
 Mm. 
 I need to move on. 
 When Doug was arguing with me about that Panther article, and I couldn't get him to see it my way, I just... 
 Something died. 
 Why don't you let me take the resumes to Eleanor? 
 Ned has a vacation day, so there's not much to do. 
 That would be great. We're still waiting on Doug's edit. 
 The only thing is Eleanor's office is closed, so you're gonna have to take it to her house. 
 Okay. 
 In Harlem. 
 [door closes] 
 Hello. 
 Hi, Jane. 
 What's going on? 
 We were just plotting. 
 Plotting revelry that's worthy of the night. 
 I'm going to do mind-bending drugs. 
 I am going to Harlem. 
 To see a friend. 
 And... and then I'm gonna make a Jell-O mold. 
 Ooh. 
 Ahh. 
 What about you, Jane? 
 I am going to the mayor's Young Society ball with my boyfriend. 
 Cindy : Ooh. Sounds so elegant. 
 Did you know, actually, that New Year's Eve is, um... is one of the most popular days for proposals? 
 Making memories and making babies, that's what I heard. 
 I didn't know that. 
 We've been the last two years, so it's a tradition. 
 Well, you know, it's not just a new year, Jane. 
 It's a new decade, so... 
 I wouldn't be afraid of trying at least one new thing tonight. 
 You know, I've never been to Harlem, so... that's new. 
 [door closes] 
 They asked me to deliver the body. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Patti. 
 Bring your story file. 
 Did it register on the Richter scale? 
 I'm not a geologist, for Christ's sake. 
 We just know the ground shook for several seconds. 
 Get a domestic angle. 
 Do we even have an idea of the scope? 
 Finn... - We just know it was big. 
 So I have a big earthquake to go on? 
 'Til you find out more, yes. 
 But Nixon can't get reliable information out of China. 
 How long have you been here, Greenstone? 
 Uh, well, almost... 
 My point being I should have been dazzled by now. 
 Get outta here. 
 What can I do for you? 
 You want to kill my story? 
 For now, yeah. 
 Why? 
 It's uninspired. 
 Doug, the rise of the Black Panthers is compelling stuff. 
 Race, power, violence, everything that sells a magazine. 
 What? Speak. 
 That's true. 
 The Panthers are the most exciting thing to happen to the counter culture since the summer of love. 
 See, that's what I want. 
 To whites, to America, the Black Panthers are Mandingo with a gun. 
 They want to steal white women. 
 That's not what I see. 
 No, of course not. 
 You see the aviators and berets, and a crack in the establishment because you're young and hip. 
 Like we should be. 
 So you want me to write a love letter to the Black Panthers? 
 Now you're talkin'. 
 It's sensationalism. 
 That's the point. 
 The Panthers themselves have meticulously crafted a sensational image. 
 Let's do it justice. 
 And the next time you want to talk, you call Angie and set a time. 
 You don't just waltz into my office. 
 [machines chugging] 
 Anything big? 
 An assassin who tried to kill the president of Panama last New Year's Eve was just gunned down himself. 
 You reap what you sow. 
 Three women are in labor at Mount Sinai. 
 Are you covering baby New Year again? 
 Ever since I started here, I've loved meeting the first baby born closest to midnight. 
 Reginald Adam Oaks was born at exactly midnight in 1961. 
 He had these rolls of fat on his forearms like someone had tied dental floss around him. 
 [laugh] That sounds irresistible. 
 I'll keep checking back. 
 [moaning] 
 [moaning] 
 Yes. Yes. Ohh. 
 I see that you're mad. 
 Yeah, well, that's what happens when you're supposed to be on one team, and suddenly you start scoring points for the other side. 
 I'm on your team. 
 People on my team don't cheer on the editor when he's killing my story. 
 I wasn't cheering him on. 
 I do think he has a point. Okay? 
 It's what I was trying to tell you after the funeral. 
 There's a better angle on this thing. 
 So you followed me in here to tell me I told you so? 
 [scoffs] That's what I thought. 
 I called the China Town Merchants Association. 
 And? 
 Closed for the holiday. 
 I also called the embassy. 
 And? - They're denying there was an earthquake. 
 They're lying. 
 It was reported in the AFP. They felt it in Hanoi. 
 Denise. 
 Yes?

 I'm about to write my first editor's page of the new decade, and, uh, well... 
 I thought you'd be a good person to talk to. 
 You like 20 year old scotch? 
 I'm sure that I would if I had ever tried it. 
 Oh. 
 You're in for a treat. 
 You can only get this in Europe. 
 It's like Cuban cigars except legal. 
 Mm. 
 If life had a taste, this would be it. 
 So, so far, I'm mulling over the idea that the '60s were a decade of repression. 
 You know, in my freshman year psychology course, we learned that suppression is conscious, but repression is unconscious. 
 I like that. 
 So you start the decade off with John F. Kennedy and Camelot, and everything appears to be perfect, only because so much is being repressed. 
 Right. 
 As the decade proceeds, everything that's painful and unresolved about American life just pushes to the surface. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 So what if the '70s are a decade about expansion? 
 So the country's moving from repression to expansion? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That's good.

 Will you run this to the copy desk? 
 Of course. 
 So, uh, you have any special young people plans for New Year's Eve? 
 I am going to The Chelsea. There are some parties there. 
 I have heard some shocking, sordid tales about that place. 
 Well, they're only shocking if you're old. 
 Or if you don't read "Rolling Stone." 
 Well, I've always been old. 
 How's that? 
 Before I left for New York, my father showed me a picture of the Empire State Building, and said win or don't come home. 
 No time to relax with a mandate like that. 
 I have some good news. 
 You've won. You can party now.

 Happy New Year. 
 Did you, uh, have a nice evening? 
 You know, I always make such a big deal about New Year's, and then it turns out to be just like any other night. 
 Hm. 
 Well, maybe the '70s will be better. 
 Goodnight. 
 Can you help me with something?
