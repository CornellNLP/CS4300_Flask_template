 JP : This morning it felt like someone took a shovel to the back of my head. 
 Oh, it's terrible. 
 Great party. 
 I'm glad you had fun. 
 Did I leave my jacket? 
 I didn't see one. 
 It was 30 degrees last night. 
 You went home without your jacket? 
 I was lit. 
 Well, I think you were scared of shirtless Gabe. 
 [laughs] 
 Hey. 
 Miss Robinson. 
 Heard you threw a party last night. 
 It was just a small thing. 
 I don't think you would have enjoyed it. 
 Mm. Judging by the damage to some of my employees, I'd have to agree. 
 All right, not a trick question. 
 Tell me what was playing on the hi-fi. 
 Rascals, Stones, Creedence. 
 No jazz. 
 [laughs] How do you party to jazz? 
 Oh, sometimes you break my heart. 
 Good morning. 
 Hi. 
 How are you feeling this morning? 
 I'm feeling pretty darn wonderful. 
 'Cause I just came in with Ned. 
 Oh, yeah, we... we decided to walk in separately. 
 Oh, that game. Yeah, I know that game. 
 Patti, I woke up this morning, and Ned was still asleep, but his arm was wrapped around me. 
 I just felt so protected. 
 And... and so happy. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 This is my story, Patti. 
 Lenny was just someone that I knew on my way to Ned. 
 I mean, I... you know, I still have to talk to Lenny, and then pick up my clothes and everything, but I will do that. I will. 
 And thank God I left this sweater here. 
 Good morning. 
 Morning back at ya. 
 I just got in an hour ago and saw your notes, so this is everything that I could pull on Dan Kucera. 
 He paints on LSD. Did you know that? 
 No, but after this last hour, I've become very familiar. 
 What's the verdict? 
 Personally, I think his work is undisciplined, but I can see that's why some people appreciate it. 
 Keep talkin'. 
 Well, he won't play by the rules, but that won't endure. 
 Rebellion for rebellion's sake, to me, is a gimmick. 
 [chuckles] Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. 
 I don't want to read any art critics. 
 You don't want context? 
 No. 
 Art is personal. It's emotional. 
 I don't need some ass telling me what to feel. 
 I'll feel it when I see the paintings. 
 I see a review as a different angle on something. 
 And there's value in that. 
 Yes, there is. 
 Yes, there is. 
 Seems like you often bring a different angle, Jane. 
 I think we should call it "The Jangle." 
 [chuckles] 
 Groovy. 
 [chatter] 
 [phones ringing] 
 Hey. 
 [telex machine chugging] 
 You look chipper. 
 I am. 
 You know, I don't get the big deal with marijuana. 
 I didn't feel anything. 
 Where's Sam? 
 In Albany with Gabe. 
 What are you doing with Gregory? 
 He's writing a story on an artist who paints well on LSD, and I'm helping him. 
 Oh, I have an idea. 
 Why don't you dose and join our lawsuit? 
 No, thank you. 
 Why not, Jane? 
 Because I think your filing, or whatever it is, is rude, not to mention unnecessary. 
 Last night you said you were a career girl. 
 I am. One who works hard, plays by the rules and advances on merit. 
 You cannot advance here. 
 You can't write. 
 Are you sure? Because I think I can. 
 And I don't bite the hand that feeds me, Patti. 
 Patti. It's Doug. 
 You leave my party early, and now you're late to work, lay about. 
 I'm not coming in today. 
 Why? 
 [sighs] I got jumped last night. 
 What? Are you okay? 
 I'm... I'm fine. I just... 
 What happened? Where were you? 
 I just... I got mugged, all right? 
 So just come to my place. 
 He was mugged after the party. 
 Oh, my God, is he okay? 
 Who was mugged? 
 Doug. 
 After Patti's party. 
 Are you kidding? 
 [knocking] 
 I can't believe they didn't take any money. 
 [sighs] Ow. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Of course. 
 They didn't even take your watch. 
 No. They didn't take anything. They couldn't. 
 I mean, they could, but they'd be stupid if they did. 
 I think they were cops. 
 What? 
 Why would the cops jump you? 
 Because I wrote a favorable piece on the Panthers. 
 After that detective in Brooklyn was killed by them. 
 Okay, if I said something like that, you'd say I had an ax to grind with the police. 
 You do. 
 But I... I think I really pissed off two of them from the 64th. 
 When they were kicking my ass, one of them said, "Remember who's side you're on." 
 To play devil's advocate, a lot of white guys might say... 
 One of them twisted my arm and held it behind my back. 
 It's a rear wrist lock. 
 It's only military or police. 
 Look... [sighs] 
 Finn wants me to follow up on graffiti. 
 I'm pretty sure this is a hardware store where Novo-22 buys her spray paints. 
 Go see if you can get a name. 
 Okay. You're gonna stay here and rest? 
 No. 
 I'm going to the police station.

 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 You know, it's funny the last few weeks whenever I've come in here, it felt like I was doing something naughty. 
 You know, but now it just... feels right, you know? 
 Uh-huh. 
 What's that? 
 Well, at the moment, it's crap. 
 It's supposed to be Finn's "What's Next for the Space Program" cover. 
 Oh, you will get it, Ned. 
 Oh, my God, did you hear about Doug? 
 He got mugged last night. 
 Is he okay? 
 Well, he's at home. 
 Um, Patti went over to help him. 
 Wow. I was supposed to take his photo today. 
 We're submitting his Panther article for a Polk Award. 
 You know, if you ever got beaten up, I would come over to your house, and make sure you were okay. 
 Yeah, I hope to never get mugged. 
 Well, you can hope, but it does happen every day. 
 And if it did, I would bandage you up, and cook your favorite food, and... What is your favorite food? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 Oh, come on. You must have something you like. 
 I like pork chops. 
 Pork chops. 
 I love pork chops. 
 ♪♪ 
 Man : I'm gonna tell you the same thing I tell the police. 
 I don't know names, I don't know addresses. 
 What do you tell people who aren't the police, like me? 
 Usually, even less. Who are you? 
 I'm Patti Robinson, I work at "News of the Week." 
 Nobody's gonna get in trouble. 
 Anybody get free advertising? 
 I'm sorry, I can't do that. 
 Then I'm sorry I can't help ya. 
 [sighs] 
 Do you sell duct tape? 
 Is this supposed to change my mind? 
 You buying 89 cents worth of tape? 
 No. It is meant to fix the seat in my car where I am gonna be living, because I can't bring home a damn story about a girl spray painting buildings. 
 Either that or driving back to my parent's house in Bayonne. 
 Thanks. 
 You expect me to believe you're gonna get fired if you don't talk to her? 
 A few weeks ago, my boss threw a typewriter through a glass window. 
 He's a mean son of a bitch. 
 Not your problem. 
 Thank you. 
 Come here. 
 She usually comes in every couple of days around 3. 
 I think that's when she gets off work or something. 
 When's the last time she was here? 
 Oh, a couple days ago. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Mm-hm. 
 [bell jingles] 
 [knocking] 
 Oh, Rhodes. 
 Heard you got mugged. 
 And that you're staying home resting. 
 But you seem all right to me. 
 I'm fine. 
 Good. So, where you goin'? 
 This is an irreversible accusation, you don't know they were rogue cops. 
 But it makes sense. If they were... 
 Look, you're pissed off and you're on a fishing expedition, a dangerous one. 
 That's why you kept it a secret, right? 
 Yeah. 
 How the hell am I supposed to help you when I don't know what you're doing? 
 You want to help? 
 Yeah. 
 At this point, I don't know what I can offer short of advice. 
 But you think that I might be right? 
 You could be. And if you are, congratulations. 
 You join a long list of illustrious journalists assaulted by the law. 
 John Zenger, beaten by the Brits, helped start the American Revolution. 
 Joe McCarthy's goons roughed up Edward R. Murrow. 
 That was a big mistake. 
 You? 
 I found a dead raccoon nailed to my door after writing about a murder in Jupiter, Florida. 
 Never had the pleasure of being jumped. Look. 
 Here's my advice. You have a fire in your belly. 
 That's great. Use it. 
 But be a professional. 
 It's a terrible thing that happened to you. 
 Don't make this personal. 
 Find us a story we can print. 
 That's your job. 
 Enjoy the whiskey. 
 [door closes] 
 Hi. Is this Mr. Angelo's? 
 Um, great, yeah, I'd like to order some thick cut pork chops. 
 Uh, yeah, can you hold two for me? 
 Great. Uh, yeah, my name is Cindy Rest... 
 Um, my name is Cindy. 
 Thank you. 
 [phone rings] 
 "News of the Week," this is Patti Robinson. 
 We have a good boss. 
 Finn? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, he's great. 
 He supports me going to the 64th precinct to chase my hunch. 
 Oh, wow. You could miss Novo-22, though, she might come into the hardware store later today. 
 You interview her. 
 And when you're done, write it. 
 Guessin' 600 words, maybe 800, kind of depends on your take. 
 My take? What do you mean, my take? 
 'Cause I'm busy. 
 You're gonna be the reporter on this, that's what you want, right? 
 Yes, yes. 
 Here's your chance. 
 I'll tell you the same thing I was told on my first story. 
 You'll be fine. 
 Just don't screw it up. 
 [whispering] 
 And it would be Doug's byline, but he would know that I did the whole thing. 
 I mean, if you would be willing to tell them that when we file the suit, it could really help us. 
 Wha... what's wrong? 
 What if we go through all of this to become reporters, and then I'm not any good? 
 Oh, Patti. You can do this. 
 I have heard you on the phone with people, and you get them to open up. 
 You can't teach the indistincts that you already have. 
 Planning, ladies? 
 You know, you really shouldn't do that in the office. 
 And on company time. 
 I told her about the lawsuit last night. 
 I was high. She doesn't approve. 
 We really need her on our side. 
 Well, yeah, because if she's not with us, she, uh... She might be against us. 
 I'll talk to her. 
 Oh, and Patti, you're gonna be great. 
 ♪♪ 
 [elevator dings] 
 [phones ringing] 
 Fill these out. 
 The next available detective will take your statement. Have a seat. 
 I don't want to talk to a detective. I want to talk to the captain. 
 And I want to meet Elvis. Sit. 
 [clears throat] 
 I'm a reporter from "News of the Week." 
 Congratulations. 
 He's a plumber. She's a teacher. 
 They're all waiting. Patiently. 
 Were any of them assaulted by New York City cops? 
 I'll call upstairs to Captain Cancro's girl. 
 See if I can get you in. 
 Thank you. 
 Gregory. 
 Well, hello. 
 I arranged a private viewing of the new Kucera show later today. 
 If, as you said, art is personal, then you should see it alone, un-influenced by public reaction. 
 You think I'm spineless? 
 Oh, I think you're a purist. 
 That is an interesting way to view me. 
 And not wrong, I might add. 
 How'd you manage to finagle a private show? 
 Is it that smile? Or do you have super powers? 
 It must be super powers. 
 I was on the phone. 
 Shall I arrange a car? 
 No. Let's walk. 
 You are coming, right? I don't like art critics, but, uh, I could use the "Jangle." 
 Absolutely. 
 Jane. 
 Cindy. 
 Um... [clears throat] Patti told me that you know about our lawsuit. 
 I'm not talking about that here. 
 Good. Well, let's go to Cole's, then. 
 Because we do need to talk about it. 
 Look, when I first started at "News of the Week," 
 I was intimidated by you. 
 You know, you are so smart and competent, and confident. 
 And your posture is amazing. 
 That's very kind of you. 
 I... I thought that you could do anything. 
 But now I know that you can't. 
 You can't grow. 
 You can't write. 
 At least not at "News of the Week," and... and that seems like such a shame. 
 Especially for somebody like you. 
 I agree with what you and the other girls want to do, just not how you want to do it. 
 Have you asked to write? 
 Have you pitched an idea to anyone? 
 Well, I sort of talked to Wick about it. 
 Wick doesn't work here anymore. 
 Do you know why that is? 
 Because he's old school. 
 So Finn brought in Gregory who's from a different world. 
 So, what are you going to do? 
 I'm going to work hard. 
 I'm going to prove my value to Gregory, and then I'm going to ask for an opportunity to advance. 
 When? 
 When the time is right. 
 I think the problem is bigger than that. 
 Women are marching in the streets, asking to be acknowledged. 
 To get paid for their work, to... to be noticed. 
 Making demands... 
 But you're not making demands, you're sneaking around. 
 You are. You are plotting against our bosses, and our friends. 
 Men aren't the enemy, Cindy, you can talk to them. 
 Maybe even your husband. 
 Um... I guess if anyone can break the mold... you can, Jane. 
 I should get my lunch to go. 
 Sit. 
 Okay. 
 Why do you think you were assaulted by two off duty cops? 
 I wrote an article that wasn't flattering about this precinct. 
 What was this article? 
 There was a shootout with the Black Panthers a month ago. 
 A detective was killed. 
 Detective Kelly. 
 James Patrick Kelly. 
 23 years on the job. 
 A wife and three daughters. 
 What proof do you have that these men who assaulted you were my cops? 
 They used a cop hold. 
 What? 
 I figured if they were your cops that you would want to know. 
 And it... It makes sense. 
 How many assaults were in the city last year? 
 All five boroughs. 
 I think about... 
 Almost 5,000. 
 Up 30 percent. 
 You know what happened to our budget last year? 
 Down 18 percent. 
 This city is so broke, it can't even afford to pay attention. 
 And my guys, they're out there killing themselves. 
 Literally. 
 Trying to keep it safe. 
 Now, the one advantage I have being stuck in this sh1t hole 30 years, I know all the slander and libel laws. 
 And you print one word about being assaulted by one of my cops, I'll own that rag you work at. 
 My article was fair. 
 I've never had a problem with the police. 
 Then why aren't you trying to help us? 
 Last thing we need are journalists making our job harder. 
 I pinch every penny, shave every nickel, do whatever I can to keep this city safe. 
 And I'm gonna keep on doin' that. 
 Any way I can. 
 And I know what all my officers are doin'. 
 [clicks tongue] 
 I think we're done. 
 
 
 
 [elevator dings] 
 I want to report an assault. 
 Fill these out, you'll see the next available detective. 
 [laughing] 
 Oh, Cindy, you have to see this. 
 He looks like a little Evil Knievel. 
 He still needs the red, white and blue jumpsuit. 
 That would be so cute. 
 [laughing] 
 Is, uh... Is that for the back of the book? 
 Um, I guess. JP asked me to bring it up. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. Uh, bye, Nedders. 
 See you, Cathy. 
 [clears throat] Um... 
 What are you doin'? 
 Looking for an old photo of Doug. 
 Which I cannot seem to find. 
 [bell jingles] 
 [door closes] 
 99 cents. That is expensive. 
 The little nozzle always clogs on me. 
 Does that ever... 
 I'm a big fan. 
 You're like the female Spider Man. 
 The 22, is that... Is that a lucky number, or birthday or... 
 What do you want? 
 I just want a moment of your time. 
 Oh, I'm not a cop or anything, I'm... I'm a storyteller, actually. 
 Like you. 
 Sort of. 
 Can I buy you a soda? 
 I'm hungry. 
 Can I buy you a soda and a burger? 
 So, how do you get into the train yard? 
 Ride between the cars. 
 They never check, but you gotta hold on with two hands. 
 So what you're doing is expensive. 
 And dangerous. 
 And you could get arrested. 
 Worse things than being arrested. 
 Like what? 
 Who gave you the name Novo-22? 
 I did. I like the way it sounds. 
 Yeah, I like that it's all that you write, Novo-22. 
 Is it a message? 
 Yeah. 
 To whom? 
 People. 
 This will be the part where I sound really dumb, but, um, what is the message? 
 I'm here. 
 Right on. 
 [knocking] 
 Hi. I'm gonna run out and get some fresh rosemary, because we are definitely gonna want that tonight. 
 Tonight? For what? 
 For dinner. [chuckles] 
 Your pork chops. 
 I think that I might actually impress you. 
 Uh, I'm going to the Knicks game tonight. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, okay, I... 
 I... I thought that we had talked about dinner. 
 I didn't know you wanted to have dinner tonight. 
 I did. 
 It's fi... It's fine. 
 It's fine. Um, I'll just, uh... 
 Um, how do I, um... 
 You know... 
 How do I get into your apartment? 
 Um, Cindy, we need to talk. 
 You know, it's fine. Um, I'll just wait 'til the game is over. 
 I... I don't know what you think about us, but you're married. 
 You took me home last night. 
 Well, because I was worried about you. 
 We had s*x this morning. 
 Yeah. 
 So... So, uh, what... what... 
 What are we doing? 
 Havin' fun. 
 I don't know. I've never done this with a married woman. 
 Is that what I am to you? 
 I didn't mean it like that. 
 I told Lenny that I slept with someone else. 
 When? 
 Last night. 
 Does he know who? 
 No. 
 [sighs] 
 I really wish you hadn't done that. 
 For your sake. 
 My sake. 
 You two got stuff you gotta work out. 
 You were pretty cruel to him last night, and maybe he deserved it. 
 I don't know, but... 
 Are you okay? 
 Am I okay? 
 Am I... 
 Am I... Am I okay? 
 Yeah, you've been hittin' the bottle hard. 
 Mm, mm. I... I am okay. 
 I am pretty damn great. 
 We never talked about moving forward. 
 I mean, we never talked about anything long term. 
 I never thought we had to. 
 You're married. 
 Married, yes, yes, you said that, Ned. 
 Hey, you're not gonna want to go out there with that. 
 Come on. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Jane : Cindy. 
 Cindy. 
 Jane. You ready to go? 
 On, my way. 
 Patti : [chuckles] 
 Hey, champ. Who gave you this? 
 I don't know. How'd it go? 
 Really, really good. 
 Yeah? 
 Novo-22 doesn't have a family. 
 She doesn't have any support system. 
 So this is her way of telling the world that she's here, that she exists. 
 That sounds promising. 
 Mm. What about you? 
 Did they do it? 
 Can I report that they did and bust them? 
 No. I don't have any real evidence. 
 I'm so, so sorry. 
 It's not over. 
 I need to get a story. 
 I went through the system as an assault victim. 
 It's like getting assaulted all over again. 
 I met teachers and construction workers who missed a whole day's work for no good reason. 
 The system's broken. 
 I saw first hand. 
 Well, that sounds promising. 
 Yeah. 
 Like a public service piece. 
 Look at us. 
 Look at us.

 Gregory : You go out on a lot of stories? 
 No, but I'd very much like to.

 Equal pay, equal rights. Equal pay, equal rights. 
 Equal pay, equal rights.

 Gregory : Hello. 
 Jane : Excuse us. I'm sorry. 
 [chanting continues] 
 This is nice, alone. 
 Thank you. 
 My pleasure. 
 The question is, if you didn't know Kucera was on LSD, would you consider this art? 
 Well, I do find it more compelling in person than in the pictures. 
 Before this, my only exposure to LSD was Joan Didion writing about it in "Slouching Toward Bethlehem." 
 "There's still an ego on a quarter of a tab, and it wants things." 
 You know it. 
 Of course. I love Joan. 
 I mean, in terms of gonzo journalists, she's the pretty high-strung women's lib version. 
 You know, there's a big, um, women's liberation march planned for August. 
 I heard some of the girls talking about it in the pit. 
 You know what I dig about the women's movement? 
 The Pill and bras on fire. 
 [chuckles] 
 I'm wondering if maybe there's a story there. 
 Yeah? What's the story? 
 Well, the women's movement seems to be growing, but will it endure? 
 Or is it just a gimmick? 
 That's a good idea. I like it. 
 If none of the guys want to write it, I could take a stab. 
 I mean, I'd have better access to some of the events than the guys. 
 And you'd bring the "Jangle." 
 [chuckles] I would. 
 You want me to talk to Finn? 
 Please. 
 You got it. 
 I might like this more if I were actually on LSD myself right now. 
 They're just a mess. 
 It's funny, I think we've changed perspectives. 
 If the point of art is to make you feel, I do feel something. 
 Yeah, by that measure, anything is art. 
 And we need to hold our artists to a higher standard. 
 Jimi Hendrix. He can light his guitar on fire, and that is art. 
 But only because he can also play the hell out of it. 
 Well, now you sound like a fuddy duddy, Gregory. 
 I'm just sayin' that great art, it needs to stand on its own. 
 Think about it, when Michelangelo, when he did his nudes, were they stick figures? 
 No, no, they were inspired. 
 And technical and flawless. 
 Every image of the human form is not art. 
 Maybe it is. 
 Really? 
 Well, how about this one, Jane, how does this make you feel? 
 [gasps] 
 Is this art? 
 Maybe I'm a great artist. 
 [chuckles] 
 [exhales] 
 [chuckles] 
 Yeah, I don't dig 'em. 
 Glad you do. 
 [chuckles] Mm-hm. 
 Patti : "Urban decay infects every branch of society. 
 This hobbled, antiquated system must be overhauled, experts say, otherwise, crime victims are doubly injured. 
 As one Bronx criminal court judge put it, What happened to our heroic and robust rebuttals to violent crimes?'" 
 That's clunky. 
 Still, that is pretty good. 
 What about mine? 
 Okay. Novo-22, she's 18 and she was raised in the New York foster care system. 
 Yeah, that's what the 22 means. 
 She was in 22 different foster care homes all over the city. 
 So, while under the care of the state of New York, while our government is supposed to be protecting her, she's out painting train cars. 
 What are you saying? 
 You missed the story, Patti. 
 What? Why do you say that? 
 Because I did the math. 
 Excuse me? 
 How she sneaks into train yards, and-and how much paint costs is not the story. 
 The story is the state of New York was responsible for this child. 
 While under their tax dollar supported care, this minor was out painting train cars all night. 
 How does that happen? 
 Who lets that happen? 
 I didn't... 
 I don't know, I didn't see that part of it. 
 When you're talking to a minor, you need to focus on that part of it. 
 Okay, I'll call social services and I'll get a comment. 
 You'll need more than a comment, you'll need names, dates, proof. 
 You can't just write what you want. 
 I didn't... [sighs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Go fix it. 
 Hey, do you want to go to the ladies room? 
 No. 
 Let's go to the ladies room. 
 Okay. 
 Patti : What is going on? 
 [groans] 
 I'm an idiot. 
 I'm an idiot, Patti. I ruined my life. 
 Ned? 
 Okay, one guy cannot ruin your whole life. 
 No, he can't. Like my grandmother used to say, be good. 
 And let those who will be clever, and she... she warned me, she warned me, Patti. 
 Cindy. Cindy. 
 Why did Ned do this? 
 What did he do? 
 He started it. 
 He kissed me. 
 He made me like him. 
 You liked him because he's a good guy. 
 No, he's not good. He's an ass. 
 You're right. 
 I think that not every relationship is meant to be long term. 
 You know? 
 Oh, it's gonna be okay. 
 No, it's not. 
 It's not gonna be okay, Patti, I... 
 I told him... 
 I told Lenny that I f*cked someone else, and I don't have anywhere to go, I... I don't know where to go. 
 Um, my place. 
 You're gonna go to my place. Okay? 
 And you can stay for as long as you want. 
 So don't worry about that. All right? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I wish that I could start over. 
 You know, back before we did any of this. 
 Is Lenny home right now? 
 Uh, not 'til after nine. 
 He has, uh... He has a study group. 
 Great. Go home, pack some stuff, whatever you think you need. 
 Bring it over to my place. 
 I have a little more work to do, but I will be home by nine. Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 This is going to be fine. 
 [door opens] 
 Hey, man. 
 How you doin'? 
 Fine. Can you take my picture? 
 Now? Like that? 
 Yeah, exactly like this. 
 [door closes] 
 Where are you going? 
 To... To Patti's. 
 Is that where you were last night? 
 It doesn't... It doesn't matter. 
 Okay, it doesn't. 
 I never knew you were so unhappy. 
 You said... that I had a year. 
 I knew you wanted a family some day. 
 And I convinced myself that it was okay. 
 I should have just told you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 And I know you are, too. 
 Cindy. 
 This is our home. 
 Your home. 
 Don't leave. 
 We'll talk about it. 
 We'll... We'll talk about everything. 
 We'll open a bottle of wine, and we'll talk about everything. 
 Miss Hollander. 
 Hm? 
 I saw you come in, but, uh, I was on the phone. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Uh, here. 
 This came for you about an hour ago. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 No, I don't have her full name, but I know that she was in the foster system from '64 to '69. 
 She might have gone by Novo. 
 Yeah, no, it's late. 
 Uh, I'll try again tomorrow. Thank you so much. 
 Robinson. You're still here. 
 Come. I have something for you. 
 How's Rhodes? 
 [sighs] Intense. 
 All right, these are a gift. 
 Uh. You have to use them. 
 [chuckles] 
 Hard Chargers of Jazz at McDougal's. 
 The line up is first rate. Make sure you stay for McCoy Tyner. 
 Now, if you don't like him, may God have mercy on your soul. 
 Thank you. 
 Pleasure. Bring someone who will enjoy it. 
 Bring someone who'll appreciate it.
