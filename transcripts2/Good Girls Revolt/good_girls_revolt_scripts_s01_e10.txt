 Man : I read it. It wasn't bad. 
 Oh, that's great. 
 This record's from last March. 
 It's the, uh, Red Stockings. 
 Thanks. 
 Finn : Why aren't they wearing red stockings? 
 [laughing] 
 Here. Hundreds of women are down in Greenwich Village. 
 It was a big deal. 
 Not very compelling. 
 What else have you got? 
 In terms of rallies or... 
 Yeah. 
 Rallies. Any of 'em get violent? 
 No cat fights. Sorry, man. 
 [laughing] 
 It's just our readers have seen sit-ins, speak-ins, f*cking sleep-ins. It's a yawn. 
 How about one woman? 
 One woman on the cover, the feminist. 
 I got Gloria Steinem. 
 Betty Freidan. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 Woof. 
 Germaine Greer. 
 And then that one. 
 Uh-uh-uh. I want a gorgeous broad. Huh? 
 One who's badder than a junk yard dog. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Gloria Steinem's not bad. 
 Finn : Is she the real leader of this thing? 
 Ned : It's hard to tell. 
 Hey, Ned, do you have any pictures of them showering together? I'd like to see that. 
 [laughing] 
 I want the idea of a woman. 
 Yeah, I hear you, boss. 
 The symbol of a woman. You know what I mean. 
 Nameless. Faceless. 
 Yeah. And not a woman, every woman. 
 That's no woman. That's a mannequin. 
 You know, when I'm walking down the street, I stop to check out a sexy mannequin. 
 They don't put Germaine f*cking Greer in the windows of Saks, do they? 
 Ned, throw together three mock ups. 
 We'll go from there. 
 Will do. 
 Oh, man. 
 I'm gonna have trouble sleeping tonight. 
 [laughing] 
 Look at this. 
 The feminine mistake. 
 I thought I had a mustache. 
 Ooh, right? 
 Buy you something sweet, young lady? 
 Definitely. 
 You know, I saw you kick this thing once. 
 I did not. 
 You did, and it was goddamn adorable. 
 Well, sometimes I really want my treats. 
 [inhaling] 
 [sighs] 
 I've been seeing Doug for the past few months. 
 Rhodes is a good man. 
 I've never done anything like this before. 
 I cannot stop thinking about you. 
 Me, neither. 
 Oh, Finn, I... 
 Um, I'm sorry. Uh, Angie is... is looking for you. 
 Your... your wife is on the line. 
 Thank you, Cindy. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Thanks, Patti. Thank you very much. 
 [mouthing] 
 Whoo. 
 Patti. 
 Don't get this Cathlyn Wilkerson girl. 
 I'm trying, but I just... 
 She was a camp counselor who played the violin. 
 That's an unexpected feeder program to the Weather Underground. 
 She's pretty, a straight A student, working on a Poli Sci degree at Swarthmore, and did a semester abroad in France, and then... she just... What? She just woke up one day, and decided she wants to overthrow a government? 
 Starts building bombs? I don't... 
 How does someone change like that? 
 Maybe she didn't. 
 Maybe every time she saluted the flag, she felt like she was lying. 
 Like the place she lived didn't represent who she was. 
 And every time she took her seat in the orchestra, instead of blending in, she wanted to scream out. 
 I think you just described insanity. 
 Maybe she felt like a soda bottle... that the world was just shaking and shaking. 
 And one day the cap comes off. 
 So she didn't evolve and change, she... 
 Burst. 
 [typing] 
 Did you get what you need? 
 Yeah. Good, thanks.

 Let's go out. 
 Cafe Viand. Pancakes for the kids, mimosas for us. 
 That sounds nice. 
 [phone rings] 
 Woodhouse here. 
 McFadden here. 
 Jesus, Wick, how the hell are you? 
 Well, I'm talkin' to you on a Sunday morning, so things could probably be better. 
 You called me, you cranky son of a bitch. 
 Yeah, because something's going on in your magazine. 
 "News of the Week" is in trouble. 
 And I'd rather have this conversation face to face. 
 You got 20 minutes tonight? 
 Reggie's 7:30 sound good? 
 Yeah. 
 Sounds good. 
 What does he want? 
 His job back, I'm guessing. 
 Son of a bitch puts in three months at "Time Magazine," and he's already crawling back. 
 It was inevitable. 
 Well. Girls, get up! 
 We're going out for breakfast. 
 [phone ringing] 
 I appreciate everyone coming out on a Sunday morning. 
 I need one of you to speak at the press conference tomorrow. 
 Oh, aren't you gonna speak? 
 I'll explain the legal process, but one of you needs to tell your story. 
 What you're doing and why. 
 Well, Patti, aren't you the obvious one? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Jane. 
 I want you to do it. 
 Yes. Jane. 
 You would be great. 
 All right. I'll do it. 
 So, I make it personal. 
 You're speaking for every woman in America. 
 Jane just got her first legitimate writing assignment. 
 [laughing] 
 We're in the home stretch. 
 The next 24 hours we carry around our secret. 
 I don't want you to say a word to anyone, but I know some of y'all are gonna talk anyway, so please, for the love of all things holy, be judicious. 
 We want to open our news conference just as "News of the Week's" issue on feminism hits the stands. 
 Eleanor. 
 Yes, June. 
 What should we wear? 
 Clothes, shoes. Bras are optional. 
 [laughing] 
 A suit or a dress? 
 You wear whatever makes you feel beautiful and brave, and not necessarily in that order. 
 Let me see that. 
 Mm. What a bunch of revolutionaries. 
 ♪♪ 
 Gentlemen. 
 Good morning. 
 Hollander. 
 Morning, Carl. 
 I got a note from Bea Burkhart. 
 About "When Our Boys Come Home"? 
 Yep. 
 Congratulations. 
 The last time she sent a note was to Peter for his investigation into falsified medical reports. 
 Then it was a straight shot to the Moscow bureau for him. 
 [sighs] She mentioned you. 
 As head researcher. 
 She did? Thank you for telling me that. 
 Oh, how's Noah been since the piece ran? 
 Same. He likes to drink beer. 
 [chuckles] 
 I actually got a few job leads for him. 
 So he's more than a source. 
 That fight at Patti's was a one time thing. 
 It's not like he walks around punching people. 
 I'm actually stopping by his place tonight. Want to come? 
 I have plans, but please tell him I said hi. 
 Will do. 
 Oh, please tell me you went home last night. 
 I did. 
 You look nice. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you free tonight? 
 So far, yeah. You? 
 I want to see you. 
 Well, then, I think we can make that happen. 
 Let's go out for a good dinner, steak. 
 Maybe I could make you dinner at your place. 
 Even better. 
 Okay. I'm on it. 
 Promise? 
 [sighs] 
 I've been missing you lately. 
 ♪♪ 
 [typing] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Tip o' the hat to you, Jane. 
 Hello. 
 I feel strongly that we should give her a head's up. 
 Why? 
 We need to think about what happens after we file. 
 We need Mrs. Burkhart's support. 
 If we had her behind us... 
 That would be a huge get. 
 Yes. 
 And telling her is good karma. 
 I'm falling in love with you, Jane. 
 But what if she tells Finn and we all get fired? 
 Let's tell her at the last minute. 
 It's a gesture of respect, but it doesn't change anything. 
 Good plan. 
 She's speaking at the Washington Press Club tomorrow, so she'll be at her home in Bethesda. 
 That means one of us should fly down, and be in position to tell her tomorrow morning. 
 I'll do it. 
 Cindy, that would mean that you're not at the press conference. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Yes. 
 Someone has to do it, and... 
 I've never been on a plane before. 
 Well, all right, then. 
 I'll fly out first thing in the morning. 
 [sighs] 
 How would it affect layout? 
 I'll show you. 
 Uh, show Gregory. 
 I'm gonna pull Robinson into this. Come here. 
 What do you think of this? 
 Sexy as hell, and it makes feminism feel edgy. Right? 
 Are there other options? 
 Well, uh... 
 I mean, that's a joke. The car is pasted in. 
 Get it? She's strong. 
 I know, this isn't a joke. 
 Um... all right. 
 This does not make me want to buy the magazine. 
 What about a photo of several women together smiling. 
 Maybe one of them has a baby, maybe... 
 How are we gonna know they're feminists? 
 How do you know that lips here is a feminist? 
 Well, that's a different message. 
 Oh, sexual freedom is only one part of liberation. 
 But it's undoubtedly the part that keeps us coming back. 
 What's the other part? 
 Women realizing that other women are restless, too. 
 And they may all want different things, but ultimately, they want the same thing. 
 Opportunity. 
 So they band together to form a tribe that understands one another. 
 I like lips. 
 [sighs] Okay. 
 I'll see your lips, and I'll raise you. 
 Take that lipstick off. Make her real. 
 That's what women, especially young women, want. 
 They want it to be real. No more paper dolls. 
 I'm glad we're doing this issue. 
 I think it's really gonna mean a lot to the other girls in the pit. 
 That is music to my ears. 
 Come tomorrow, the newsroom's gonna be full of with smiles, and girls in good moods. 
 On days like that, who doesn't love coming to work. 
 Am I right, Ned? 
 Right-o. 
 Thanks for schooling me. 
 You have an uncluttered way of expressing yourself. 
 I'm very neat. 
 I wasn't saying you are tidy around the house. 
 I was referring to... Thank you. 
 The way in which you reason. 
 The way you describe things logically, it's enviable. 
 But, your statement sounds like someone with a safety net. 
 Someone who comes from privilege with nothing on the line. 
 And at this conference, do you know who you are? 
 You are oppressed. 
 So speak from your heart. 
 Stop trying to make everyone feel comfortable. 
 I think I can still make my point without being rude. 
 Bullshit. 
 No one cares if you thank them for attending. 
 They want to know why a pretty white girl with every advantage in the world wants to work hard when she could marry and have babies, and get her hair done once a week. 
 I see. 
 Jane, I wanted you to be the speaker tomorrow because you are focused and self possessed. 
 And you remind me of myself. 
 Watching you, I realize how intimidating I must be. 
 [chuckles] 
 I always thought that I would be standing next to my husband as he announced his bid for office, or thanked his colleagues for an award. 
 I never thought that I would be the one standing up in front of the microphone.

 I'm doing well at "Time," so let's get that out of the way. 
 Okay. 
 And I'm not here to tell you we want to hire you away from "News of the Week." 
 So let's get that out of the way. 
 It's out of the way. 
 Ted, give me a... another Glenlivet on the rocks. 
 Right away. 
 You're being played, Finn. 
 Who's playing me, Wick? 
 Gregory Sansone. 
 Here you are, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, I have a lot of respect for the institution that gave me my career. 
 You don't know him. 
 Tell me, how much ad money is coming from the big three since you hired Gregory? 
 That's proprietary information, Wick, you know that. 
 Car companies were promised favorable coverage from him in return for big ad buys. 
 You can't promise favorable coverage. 
 The profile on Ralph Nader on car safety. 
 You know, Finn, I got 30 years at "News of the Week." 
 Now, if this magazine goes down as a useless rag that sold it's soul out for ad buys, people look at me differently as if it was going on the whole time. 
 It wasn't, and it isn't. 
 You need to look under the bed, Finn. 
 [sighs] 
 I grew up with Gregory. 
 Mm-hm. 
 One drink with a guy I fired isn't gonna convince me you know him better than I do. 
 [chuckling] 
 With this pad, I bet the ladies go wild. 
 You got that right. 
 [chuckling] 
 I wanted to apologize. 
 For what? 
 All that stuff about my needing a job. 
 The truth is, I... 
 Yeah, I made some calls. 
 There's a couple different outfits there, but all of them are looking. 
 I'm pretty sure "The Times" pays the best, but, uh, it's an early shift, so... 
 I'm bein' honest. I didn't think you were gonna do it. 
 I'm a suspicious son of a bitch like that. 
 Are you kiddin'? 
 After that party, I, uh... 
 Hey, you're right. 
 I've been busy, that's all. 
 Went up to Belmont. 
 Stopped by Mom's place. 
 Yeah? How's Nancy doing? 
 She's good. She's, uh... good. 
 Went through some old boxes. 
 You won't believe what I found. 
 Hot damn.

 [gasps] Jesus, Doug, what are you doing here? 
 A first person account of how you're gonna sue "News of the Week"? 
 I was supposed to meet you at your place. 
 I convinced your super to let me in. 
 Doug, I was going to tell you tonight. 
 Well, we aren't protected from getting fired until we file the complaint. 
 But I can't fire you. 
 So you could have told me at any point. 
 Yeah, but you might have... 
 Told on you? 
 You think I'm gonna tell somebody you want to be a reporter? 
 You've lied to my face. For months. 
 I know. 
 To everyone's face. 
 I know, and I feel terrible about that. 
 Finn's gonna hit the roof. 
 Are you hearing me?

 Why are you with me? 
 Doug, it's not like that, it... 
 I'm sorry, I'm... I know it's messy. 
 Damnit, Patti, I... I would have supported it. 
 Like you did with Altamont? 
 That was months ago. 
 You told me I was a researcher, not a reporter. 
 I would have cheered you on. 
 Hell, Patti, I would have helped you. 
 Like you did with my Novo-22 article? 
 You screwed that up and you know it. 
 Was your first article perfect? 
 Huh? 
 Or did some researcher catch all of your mistakes, proof-read you, make you look brilliant. 
 And by the way, even if my copy had been perfect, I still wouldn't have gotten a byline. 
 Where are you going? 
 Somewhere I don't have to fight with you. 
 Damnit. 
 What is wrong with us, Patti? 
 [door slams] 
 [hair dryer blowing] 
 Oh. Hello. 
 Uh... [sighs] 
 Lenny, uh, do you remember a couple months ago when I asked you about that civil rights law? 
 No. 
 Well, I... I asked you about the rights of women, uh, to be reporters. 
 Vaguely. 
 I was asking because "News of the Week" relegates women to research jobs. 
 And that is not fair. 
 We are filing a complaint with the EEOC, uh, the Equal Employment Opportunity... 
 I know what the EEOC is, Cindy. 
 You need a lawyer, you know. 
 We have one. 
 Uh, Eleanor Holmes Norton of the ACLU. 
 You went to a lawyer at the ACLU? 
 Yes. 
 When? 
 Just before Christmas. 
 You've been doing this since the holidays?

 This isn't you. 
 It is. 
 This is me, Lenny. 
 How are you gonna be a wife and a mother if you're at the office all day? 
 Did you think about that? 
 You are so f*cking selfish.

 Well, for argument's sake, then, I'll ask you the same question that I'd ask your brother. 
 Do you have a five year plan? 
 No? 
 I have a three year plan. 
 I'll become a reporter first. 
 And then I'll apply to the Masters in Law program at Yale. 
 It's for journalists who want to cover the Supreme court. 
 I want to write about the highest court in the land. 
 And I would be the first woman to do that. 
 If we win. 
 If they let me become a reporter. 
 Because I need clips to apply to the law program. 
 And how are you gonna pay for graduate school? 
 Did you think about that? 
 There are fellowships. 
 I see. 
 Fine. So you don't need anything. 
 Or anyone.

 Vietnam's been going on for years. 
 Why do you want to go now? 
 The Weather Underground story gave me a taste of covering life and death. 
 I want more of it. 
 Or just send me, I'll produce for you. 
 I'll let you cover the war. 
 The one here. 
 Vietnam's winding down or dragging on, I'm not sure which. 
 You're kidding me. 
 This war at home, the one that's got dozens of bombs going off throughout New York City each month, that needs to be covered by great writers like you. 
 But I've done that for two years. Come on. 
 Look, I'm editor-at-large of this magazine. 
 I call the shots. I want you to keep doing what you're doing. 
 Do you? 
 Do you call the shots around here? 
 I don't know what crawled up your ass... 
 Either I write for "News of the Week" over there, or I write for another publication. 
 Where is everyone? 
 Go downstairs and get me a cup of coffee. 
 Yeah, sure.

 Mrs. Burkhart, - Cindy Reston. 
 Good morning. 
 Well, this is the first time I've received an urgent visit... 
 That's the word you used, isn't it? 
 From a researcher from "News of the Week." 
 Much less this early in the morning. 
 Not to mention without a call first. 
 Uh, well... it is my first time in Washington. 
 Uh, your home is lovely. 
 What the hell's goin' on? 
 [chuckles] 
 I know that it may seem rude, me showing up like this, but it was actually meant to be the opposite, to be extra polite. 
 [chuckles] 
 Mrs. Burkhart, this morning, there is going to be a press conference. 
 Several dozen researchers from "News of the Week" are going to ask to be treated equally. 
 I'm not following. 
 Equal... t-to the men. 
 You girls want to do men's jobs? 
 Federal law gives women the same opportunities as men. 
 But "News of the Week" won't allow women to be reporters. 
 So we have filed a complaint with the EEOC. 
 But I'm the publisher. 
 Yeah. 
 So who's side am I supposed to be on? 
 ♪♪ 
 What did you tell the car companies about our Ralph Nader story? 
 I don't remember word for word. 
 I know I brought in revenue. 
 So you're welcome. 
 Revenue's easy. 
 It's earning it with integrity. 
 You can't undo the impression that we're for sale. 
 Angie : Finn. 
 Finn! 
 Bea Burkhart's on the phone. She says it's an emergency. 
 ♪♪ 
 Finn, lawyers from the New York office are headed your way, and I am madder than hell. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 It's almost show time, ladies. 
 Eleanor. What happens now? 
 This. 
 But after this, do we go back to work as reporters? 
 The purpose of today is to publicly embarrass your bosses. 
 Our hope is that they voluntarily submit to the law instead of waiting for the commission to rule. 
 So we go back as researchers and wait? 
 Yes, but I dare any man that works at "News of the Week" to try and hold his head up high after this. 
 Um, but this isn't personal. 
 Of course it is. 
 Outside of a person's love, the only thing more sacred they can give is their labor. 
 You've given the magazine your labor, and they've used you. 
 But I don't think... 
 They take us for granted, Patti. 
 Now they can't be slippery with us. 
 We're trying them in the court of public opinion. 
 Eleanor, where should we sit? 
 Jane. I have to go. 
 What? 
 I have to go tell Finn. 
 He should hear... 
 No, Patti. 
 We need you here. 
 This will ruin his career, Jane. 
 Other places let women write. 
 He won't let us write. He could, but he doesn't. 
 I have to.

 We have asked sweetly to be allowed to prove ourselves at the office. 
 We have asked permission to be treated equally to men we work next to. 
 Enough. 
 Today, we demand that our employer comply with federal law. 
 At "News of the Week," women are not permitted to appear in the magazine under a byline. 
 And yet, we know the magazine would not achieve the level of quality it is known for without our contributions. 
 There is no mysterious God given talent required to the reporter at "News of the Week." 
 It is a mixture of talent, hard work, and opportunity. 
 We deserve, and are entitled to that opportunity.
