 We need someone to investigate Osela. 
 Maybe if you guys didn't shoot Ruby you could be talking to her right now.

 Peter's been trying to expose SOC for weeks. 
 He got fired. 
 Everything you need to destroy SOC and Baker is on this drive. 
 I thought you understood that you can't go back. 
 woman : You're the American woman soldier. 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 [text message whistles] 
 Where did you send that? 
 Great. Now it's out. 
 Aslam! 
 I am going. 
 Oh, my God. Odelle lives! [phone swooshes] 
 Glen : Are you sure it's authentic? 
 Where in Spain? I'll leave immediately. 
 female reporter : Continuing with our top story, multiple sources claim Special Ops soldier Sergeant Odelle Ballard is now alive. 
 Military analysts are investigating the legitimacy of these reports and, if true, Ballard's exact whereabouts. 
 As with all of us, they're anxious to hear her miraculous story of survival. 
 [classical music] 
 Sophia : Are you sure it's authentic? 
 Of course. My source got it from the teenager in Algeria who saw her. 
 She was with her when... Am I keeping you from something? 
 There are several of your diplomats and congressmen waiting to hear how I intend to deal with my country's debt crisis. 
 Odelle. That's the answer. 
 When she comes forward SOC and Baker will be prosecuted. 
 Cancel tomorrow's meeting. 
 I would like to, but... 
 But what? You've got your proof. 
 No, you have a photograph, nothing more. 
 Well, what do you need? 
 I would need to know what she is going to say. 
 She'll tell the world what she saw. 
 What Alex Baker did to her. 
 I wish I could share your optimism, but the deal Baker offers is a good one. 
 [Peter sighs] 
 Much better thanks to you. 
 Oh, so that's what this was about? 
 Getting a better deal? 
 Madam, they are waiting. 
 Right away, Kharon. 
 You're better than this. 
 Find more than a photo. 
 Tell me Odelle Ballard is going to tell the story we need her to tell. 
 If so, I will walk away. 
 Alex Baker murdered my husband. 
 It sickens me to be in business with him. 
 Find me a way not to be.

 It's good. 
 You're an excellent writer, Harrison. 
 Thanks. And it's all true. 
 Every... every... everything in there's happened, so... 
 Well, full disclosure, I'm already working on the story. 
 Um, my colleague, Isabel Rainey is meeting with Odelle. 
 So you know it's true then? 
 But we've got people working on background material on Alex Baker, SOC, Osela, Black Sands, and your stuff fits right in. 
 Gives us fantastic personal context.

 But you can contribute. 
 Is that a joke?

 No, no, no, Har... 
 I'm just gonna turn everything over to you. 
 Is that... Is that what you think? 
 To hell with that. 
 Wait, wait.

 If we use your stuff you'll get a credit. 
 We're not stealing. 
 This thing has bulldozed my life.

 Yup.

 Yeah. I... did you... did you... Did you talk to them? 
 My family? 
 Of course I did.

 Isabel : There were a lot of tears and relief... and joy. 
 Odelle, I am so honored to have been the one to make that call.

 Are you all right? 
 I'm fine. 
 Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Good. I will see you tomorrow, then. 
 And, Odelle? We're going to get your story out. You did it. 
 You're going to be a hero. 
 Thank you.

 My family's coming... 
 Tomorrow. 
 You're gonna get to meet them.

 No, not yet, 'cause the reporter's gotta talk to them first and make sure it's safe.

 They'll love you. Just like I do. 
 Dinner is ready. You should come.

 Where the hell have you been? 
 I've been waiting for over two hours. 
 What are you, my mother? What do you want? 
 You sent that photo. Odelle is alive. 
 That changes everything. I need your help. 
 Oh, really? [chuckles] 
 You don't remember when I was trying to figure out who killed my father and then you wouldn't even return my calls?

 Who is Odelle talking to and what is she going to say? 
 I don't know. All right? 
 All right, listen, all I've heard is that she's meeting with a reporter named Isabel Rainey. 
 I don't know where. I don't know when. 
 That's all I know. 
 Where are you going? 
 The  Times. 
 [laughs] Well, what makes you think they'll tell you anything? 
 Odelle : How long were you and Luc married?

 Well, not long enough. 
 He's a dazzling habit, but... 
 You know that already. 
 What do you mean? 
 You've been out in the desert with him for, what? A month? 
 Odelle : Yeah, almost. 
 How was it? 
 It was hell. 
 I mean, yeah, he's charming, but he's also a conceited, selfish b*st*rd that almost got me killed. 
 Christina : See, you do know. 
 Know? Know what? 
 Luc called me out of the blue to ask me to help you. 
 Why would he do that?

 Peter : Thanks for seeing me on short notice. 
 Hey, happy to do it. I remember you from... the Justice Department. You made... 
 Quite a few headlines. 
 Well, this is another one. 
 Right, Odelle Ballard. 
 You have information? 
 I do. 
 But first I want to know if Isabel Rainey has spoken to Odelle yet. 
 I know they're meeting. What has she told her? 
 Well, I can't divulge that. 
 [Peter chuckles] 
 Did she mention Societel? SOC? 
 Anything about how they gave millions to Abdul Abbas? 
 I can't discuss anything that Odelle may or may not have told us. 
 [Peter laughs] 
 You just did. 
 I mention one of the biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange doing business with an Al-Qaeda terrorist and you didn't even bat an eye. 
 Ballard talked. Gave you broad strokes at least. 
 When do you go to press? 
 Look, I thought you were here to give me something. 
 I am. 
 The information on this drive will support everything Odelle Ballard has to say and more. 
 SOC funded terrorism. They've been doing it for years. 
 To secure markets or gain an advantage. 
 They've also conspired to murder dozens of innocent people to cover it up. 
 Where'd you get this? 
 They used to be my client. 
 This is whistle-blower stuff then. 
 You're taking a very big risk bringing this to me. 
 [chuckles] Don't I know it. 
 How did you get this? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 What matters is that it's real, it's credible, and when you publish it I'm going to jail.

 I'm gonna tell the world what you did and nothing that you can say can stop me. 
 I'm not here to stop you. 
 Then what? 
 What do you want? 
 20 minutes right now. 
 I have a meeting. 
 With Isabel Rainey of the  New York Times.   I know. 
 And Ron and Suzanne are flying in today. 
 It's 20 minutes, Odelle. 
 It's in your best interest. Please. 
 [dramatic music] 
 ♪ 
 You got ten minutes. There. Now. 
 Whatever you have to say is irrelevant. 
 And the fact is, you killed all 12 of my unit. 
 12 brave soldiers. My friends. 
 There is no answer for that. You killed them. 
 And in six minutes I'm gonna walk to that café and I'm gonna tell my story and the whole world is gonna know what you did. 
 I think you're smarter than that. 
 Yes, you can tell your story to the  New York Times, 
 The Washington Post. You can even write a book. 
 But what do you think will happen? 
 Who do you think will listen? 
 Who do you think will believe you? 
 I have evidence. 
 Off a terrorist's computer. 
 And bank statements. 
 That can be buried. 
 Odelle, do you honestly think that we will just sit back and do nothing? 
 That your story will be the only version of what happened? 
 There are many questions about you right now. 
 Questions we will answer in one of two ways: We will either say Odelle Ballard is a brave hero, a valuable covert operative who was performing a dangerous and important mission in service to her country, or... 
 Odelle Ballard is a calculating and brutal traitor who turned on her unit, conspiring with terrorists to ensure their deaths. 
 The military has now succeeded in capturing her and will ensure that she spends the rest of her life in prison. 
 And that she will never, never... see her home or family again. 
 How much are they paying you? 
 This isn't about money. 
 No? 
 This is about the truth. 
 Not the truth we all want so desperately to believe in, but the truth that actually is. 
 People like me face that truth every day so people like you can live the lie. 
 The lie that life isn't, at its core, unforgivingly and profoundly brutal. 
 This is the world we live in today. 
 Nations have no borders. 
 Our interests are global. 
 And we're all fighting for world dominance. 
 That is why we fight and, yes, we fight brutally. 
 Well, I feel sorry for you. 
 I mean, this battle of yours is worth more than life itself. 
 You once considered me a... a daughter. 
 Yo... you don't think I suffered making that decision? 
 It was the most painful moment in my life. 
 It broke my heart! 
 Then why do it? 
 So America can win? 
 Who gave you the right to play God? 
 To decide who lives and who dies? 
 Because I didn't vote for you. Nobody did. 
 You're doing this because you can. 
 Well, I'm sorry to hear you feel that way. 
 Because it means Suzanne will grow up without a mother. 
 How could you? 
 It's not up to me. 
 Odelle, you have the power in your hands to walk to that café, tell Isabel Rainey you're sorry, but this has all been a terrible mistake, and go home. 
 And knowing you as I do, you know what I think? 
 I think you'll make the right decision for Suzanne. 
 You'll go home.

 Hang back. I have to talk to Sophia. 
 Wait, wait, Woah, hang on, hang on. 
 What just happened? 
 I gave it to him. 
 What? You gave the drive to the  Times? 
 Peter, someone got killed over that. 
 Use it and you go to jail. 
 I know. 
 I can't figure out whether you're a saint or a fool. 
 I don't know what I am. A fool, a criminal... maybe I'm just like anybody else trying to do the right thing. 
 Peter, one thing I know, you're not like anyone else. [elevator bell dings] 
 Hold it right there. 
 It's a private meeting. 
 I need to speak with Sophia. 
 I'm sure you do. 
 But that's not going to happen. 
 You think you've won? You couldn't be more wrong. 
 I just came from the  New York Times. 
 Everything you've done, the murder, extortion, it's all coming out. 
 Only if they print it. 
 Oh, they will. 
 Once they get a look at what's on that flash drive. 
 I gave it to them. 
 Whatever you say, Peter. 
 Even if for some reason they don't print it, they're not gonna ignore her. 
 Odelle Ballard. 
 It's awkward to be the last one to know something, so I sympathize. 
 What are you talking about? 
 We are acutely aware that Odelle Ballard is speaking to  New York Times,  but I wouldn't be in my position if I didn't know precisely what she's going to say. 
 She wants her life back. 
 She's choosing to keep her family, not destroy them. 
 She won't say a word about SOC, nothing about terrorists or the tragic end of her unit. 
 You see, unlike you, Peter, Odelle understands the value of her family. 
 She'll play nice.

 We are as stunned as everyone to learn that Sgt. Ballard was alive. 
 We are curious about how she spent these last few weeks. 
 We have heard... 
 Just give me a second. 
 Unsubstantiated rumors that Sgt. Ballard has been colluding with the enemy, but nothing is confirmed. 
 No charges have been filed against her at this point. 
 We're not sure what to believe about Sgt. Ballard.

 Where is she going, Ron? I need to protect her. 
 We trusted you and you lied to us. 
 You son of a bitch! 
 You don't understand. 
 You stay the hell away from us!

 All set? 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Yes? 
 What? 
 But why? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, got it. Okay, thank you. 
 Aslam... 
 There has been a change. 
 Um... 
 What? 
 What has happened? Is she okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, she's fine, but, um... she wants me to take you back to Sassel Beach where you will stay with Luc. 
 I'll call him. 
 But... but no. 
 I'm... I'm going to America with Odelle. 
 [telephone line ringing] 
 Let me talk to her. 
 No, you cannot. 
 You cannot. You cannot! 
 That was the reporter of the  New York Times  delivering a message from her. 
 You're not going to America. 
 Not right now. 
 But why? 
 Did she change her mind? 
 [telephone line ringing] 
 Come on, Luc! 
 Was it her family? They don't want me to come? 
 No. No, that's not it. 
 She just said we must go now. 
 Okay? Aslam... 
 [phone beeps] Aslam, where are you going? 
 Aslam. Please, come back. 
 No. 
 Something is not right. I have to find her. 
 Where are you going? Come back! 
 Just leave me alone.

 Hey, Harrison. 
 What are you doing here, Bob? 
 I'm here because you're here. 
 Your mom said you spoke to the cops. 
 Self-defense. 
 The Odelle thing is really blowing up. 
 About Odelle Ballard as she eludes capture in Barcelona, Spain. 
 Military sources tell us she is a deserter... 
 Harrison, you see what they're doing here? 
 male reporter : And subject to court martial as a traitor... 
 Bob : I mean, do you hear this? 
 Harrison, we need to do something, don't we? 
 Bob : Hi, Anna. 
 Hi, Bob. 
 Harrison, you okay? 
 What do you want, Anna? What do you... 
 We're worried about you.

 Everything. 
 [voicemail beeps] Hey, Sarah. 
 Um, this is message number... 
 [scoffs] I don't even know anymore. 
 Uh... 
 I guess you heard the news. 
 I just... wanna talk. 
 Now that it's over. 
 Look, I know I can't undo what I did, but... 
 Maybe we can start over. 
 Just... 
 Call me back when you can.

 I've been dreading this good-bye all day, so I thought I'd get it over with now. 
 At the beginning of our evening. 
 Thank you... 
 For everything you have done for Greece... 
 And for me personally. 
 I know I enticed you into all of this. 
 Well... 
 [both laugh] 
 I did what I wanted to do. 
 Oh, it's been an ordeal. 
 I'm glad we went through it. 
 In a way... it has brought us closer again. 
 The last time we parted in shame, but tonight we part as dear friends. 
 You will always be in my heart, Peter.
