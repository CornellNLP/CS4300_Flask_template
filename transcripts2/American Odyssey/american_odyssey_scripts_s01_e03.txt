 Ballard tried to call home. We have her coordinates. 
 I'll go myself. 
 We killed U.S. soldiers.

 What were you thinking? 
 Why didn't you answer your phone? 
 You scared me to death. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But... they said they had proof she's alive. 
 An email. 
 Dolly, people make up all sorts of things, crazy, hurtful things. 
 What if they're telling the truth? 
 Maybe. 
 I don't know. 
 I do know it's freezing. 
 How about we go home and discuss it on the way?

 Let's spend the night in the city, and we'll do something special tomorrow, just you and me, okay? 
 Maya : Who was he? 
 Who? 
 That guy last night, outside the house. 
 An associate. 
 He was pestering me about a deal. 
 You were screaming at him. 
 You told him to stay away from your family. 
 Did you tell Mom? 
 There's nothing to tell. 
 So you lied. 
 I-I didn't lie to anyone. 
 Dad... what's going on? 
 I mean, first you get arrested... 
 That was a mistake. 
 And that guy Gentry? 
 They mistook me for someone else. 
 Why would they think you had anything to do with that? 
 Seriously, honey, honestly, look at me. 
 Do you think I would do something like that? 
 Do you? 
 No.

 I was worried about you. 
 I did some digging. 
 What is it? 
 Okay, you're not gonna be happy. 
 I spoke to a military contact. 
 Apparently, special ops soldiers don't carry cell phones, at least not on missions. 
 So? 
 So the email allegedly sent by Odelle Ballard doesn't exist. 
 It never existed. 
 Bob made it up. 
 Why would he do that?

 See you a minute? 
 Everything all right? 
 I heard about the arrest last night. 
 Police barging into your home, handcuffing you in front of your children. 
 It sounds awful. 
 It was a mistake. 
 Somehow my driver's license and credit card got in the hands of the wrong people. 
 Reminds us all to be more careful. 
 Well, I'm glad that it's straightened out. 
 We need you on Sophia Tsaldari. 
 Baker wants that meeting.

 I have a call in to the Greek ambassador. 
 It would be extremely beneficial for us, and for you.

 I...I know who you are. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You didn't think I'd find it? 
 Harrison : "Who's Fighting Terrorism In Africa?" 
 What is this? 
 You don't know? Really? 
 No, Bob, I really don't know. 
 It's an article about military contractors. 
 Guess who's quoted as a source. 
 Colonel Stephen Glen. 
 Uh... 
 The colonel that Odelle Ballard sent the email to. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, but... 
 Look at the byline! 
 Harrison : Randall Walters. 
 My father knows Colonel Glen?

 Okay.

 00090, yes. 
 Yes, this conversation is starting to bore me. 
 Look at me. 
 You don't want me to get bored. 
 What? 
 [both speak native language]_ 
 Al-Qaeda. 
 They only think of one thing: vengeance. 
 Hamid can't even look at you without seeing red. 
 Me, I'm different. 
 I try to see the bigger picture. 
 I envision my country being... being liberated, from the French, from the Americans. 
 I think you can help me with that. 
 I don't help terrorists. 
 Terrorist, yes. 
 You know, Muslims were heroes to you 30 years ago when we fought the Soviets. 
 When we overthrew Gaddafi, your senators called us freedom fighters. 
 Now we're terrorists. 
 Why am I not a soldier, like you, a patriot? 
 Tell me, how does it feel to lose your life for a government that has betrayed you? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Your government is feeding this story to the media. 
 Your entire unit was wiped out by Ansar Dine. 
 You and I both know that's a lie. 
 It was an American drone. 
 You survived by some miracle. 
 Your government knows it. 
 See the headline. 
 No survivors. 
 Why is that? Why are they lying? 
 Why do they insist that you're dead, Sergeant? 
 No one else... 
 No one else knows that I survived. 
 The world knows. 
 This picture was broadcast on Al Jazeera. 
 It's all over the Internet. 
 But they are saying... that's a lie too. 
 You have a husband... and a daughter. 
 They've been told that picture is a... is a fake, a cruel hoax. 
 Your family's planning your funeral right now. 
 No one's coming for you, Odelle. 
 I'm your only friend in the world right now. 
 So tell me, why would the Americans want to kill their own heroes? 
 [groans] 
 [camel grunts] 
 All right, thanks. 
 Hey, Joe. 
 Yeah. 
 Did you speak to that colonel about Odelle Ballard yet? 
 Yeah, DoD says she's dead. 
 Her body's being flown back home as we speak. 
 Sorry, buddy. 
 Hey, maybe it's time you let this one go. 
 Huh? You look terrible. 
 Want to get a drink tonight at Trinity? 
 Those flowers arrive for Mrs. Gentry yet? 
 They did, and I'm sure she would have been touched had she actually been there, but she's in New York. 
 Her husband's body. 
 Know where she's staying? 
 Oh, come on, really? 
 Told me to send the flowers... 
 You're gonna start with her? 
 Dial the Gentry house in Delaware. 
 I told you, she's not there. 
 Hi, this is Peter Decker in New York City. 
 Who am I speaking with? 
 Denise, the babysitter. 
 Hi, Denise. 
 I'm supposed to be meeting with Mrs. Gentry right now, and I'm running late. 
 She asked me to meet her at her hotel, but I forgot to write it down. 
 Maybe you can give me the hotel name. 
 Ramada Inn, of course. 
 Is that downtown? 
 Midtown, right, thanks. Thanks, Denise, bye. 
 Wow, you should work this hard at your real job. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I have a spoon?

 [speaks Arabic] 
 You speak Arabic. 
 [speaks Arabic] 
 This is an Ansar Dine safe house. 
 Hamid is here as my guest. 
 I invited him to avenge Abbas's death, but not before you tell me why your country wants you dead. 
 If you want to continue this conversation, we speak English. 
 I appreciate what you're trying to do, but you won't be able to come between me and Hamid and his Al-Qaeda brothers. 
 The enemy of my enemy is my friend. 
 Did your friend tell you he's in bed with Americans? 
 Why does Hamid want to kill me so badly? 
 It's more than vengeance. 
 He doesn't want the truth to get out any more than my government does. 
 Uh-huh, what truth? 
 Al-Qaeda took millions of dollars from an American corporation, maybe more than one. 
 You know, female prisoners are far more clever than the men... far more. 
 That's very good. 
 It's an inventive story. 
 I was with the unit that captured Abbas. 
 I saw something I wasn't supposed to, documentation of wired funds from a U.S. corporation. 
 You really want to help your cause? 
 There it is. 
 Abbas is being funded by the very people you're fighting. 
 And you can prove this? 
 Yes, I can. 
 Good... good. 
 Because if you don't, I'll slit your throat myself.

 You wrote an article for New York Magazine  three years ago about military contractors. 
 Uh-huh. 
 You quoted a Colonel Stephen Glen. 
 I need to talk to him. 
 Is this about that soldier again?

 Thank you for coming. 
 Here, have a seat. 
 You want something? 
 No? We're good. 
 How you holding up? 
 When I found out you were in New York, I thought... 
 What do you want from me, Mr. Decker? 
 I know you blame me for what happened to Danny. 
 But I want you to know I am doing everything possible to bring the people responsible for this to justice. 
 In order to do that, I need your help. 
 I'm sorry, I can't. 
 I'm not allowed. Bye. 
 What do you mean you can't? Hey. 
 Did something happen? 
 Have you been instructed not to talk to me? 
 By who? Societele? 
 I got a letter from the Air Force right after Danny was killed, saying he was being dismissed due to misconduct. 
 They said I was losing all of Danny's benefits. 
 Pension, medical. 
 Sophie's got asthma medicine. 
 Societele said they'd take care of us. 
 All I had to do was sign some papers. 
 A confidentiality agreement. 
 Do you have a copy? 
 Can I see it? 
 I know it's blood money, but what can I do? 
 How are we supposed to live? 
 It's okay. 
 You did what you needed to do. 
 I'll find another way to go after them. 
 Do right by Danny. 
 It's okay. 
 Is there something else? 
 I'll get you that agreement. 
 Ugh! 
 Your lying, wasting my time. 
 There is proof. 
 If you let them kill me, you'll never get it. 
 What is it? Tell me. 
 A flash drive. 
 My companion, a boy. 
 He was holding it for me on the truck. 
 Your men shot him. 
 They didn't tell you that? 
 They told Hamid when they brought me in. 
 Who's this boy that you trust with such evidence? 
 He was my friend.

 Societele is paying Gentry's widow $1/2 million. 
 Why would they pay her so much?

 Peter : Where'd it come from?

 Looks like Danny kept a journal, about the drone attack, Societele. 
 Holy crap. 
 Flight logs. 
 Emails. 
 He documented everything. 
 Too bad we can't use it. 
 Why not? 
 Well, how can we prove it's real? 
 Gentry's dead. 
 His wife's locked up by Societele. 
 No, she's not. 
 All she has to do is verify this stuff. 
 It doesn't breach confidentiality.

 Pleasure, thank you.

 Actually it's my son's article. 
 Oh, journalist like the old man, huh? 
 Good for you. 
 So how can I help? 
 Well, it regards Sergeant Odelle Ballard. 
 Well, there have been conflicting reports, and I just... I wanted to hear it directly from you. 
 Is there any truth to the rumor that she's alive? 
 I thought you looked familiar. 
 I've seen you interviewed about this. 
 Harrison has it in his head that there's some grand conspiracy. 
 But before he goes any further, I thought he should get the truth from you. 
 I...hope you don't mind. 
 No, not at all. 
 I have kids of my own. 
 Let me put this simply, son. 
 Sergeant Ballard died serving her country. 
 Any reports to the contrary are false. 
 There was an email she sent to you after she was reportedly killed. 
 Sent to me? Absolutely not. 
 What if I were to tell you that we have a copy of this email? 
 I'd tell you it's a fake. 
 Well, we can verify it. 
 Harrison. 
 You people have no sense of decency. 
 Exploiting heroes, my friend, for your personal benefit. 
 Sergeant Ballard and her unit fought for your freedom. 
 They deserve respect, damn it! 
 Respect! 
 I'm very sorry. 
 Harrison, I think you owe the Colonel an apology. 
 [speaks french] 
 Offends Allah, huh? 
 Come on, Allah wouldn't mind if you numb the pain. 
 Something tells me that whatever's on that jump drive might offend Allah too. 
 There's an Internet cafe just outside of town. 
 I say we take a peek. 
 Take me to my uncle's house.

 He was lying. 
 You were right, Son. 
 Okay, so... what do I do now? 
 You do nothing. 
 I'm not walking away from this.
