 We found him... Yusuf's contact, the cleric from London. 
 What is this? What's going on? 
 You don't understand. Maya! 
 Whoever's listening to this, you got the ring wrong. 
 We know she's alive. 
 You stay here, you'll be next. 
 Did you come for me or her? 
 Odelle : So you brought him here? 
 You and your Osela friends will take her away, and I will never see you again. 
 Ruby's lying about who she is. 
 You're responsible for Harrison. 
 He's gotten too close. 
 King's Point? 
 Bob : Get your hands off my mother. 
 Ma! 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 [both groan] 
 Don't get that. 
 [cell phone continues ringing] 
 Bob, it's 5:00 a.m. 
 Harrison! 
 She did it. She did it. I can't believe it. 
 I can't believe she did it. Oh, my God. 
 Harrison : Who did what? Just take a breath. 
 Tell me what happened. 
 Bob : Ruby killed my mother. 
 What? 
 She's dead! 
 What the hell happened? 
 Bob : My mother is dead! 
 I made her a peanut butter sandwich, and she just sat there. 
 I'm so, so sorry, Bob. 
 Bob : Ruby did it. I know she did it. I know it! 
 Just calm down. Listen to me. 
 It's normal to want to blame someone, I get that, but... 
 Wait. 
 Are you... are you with her right now? 
 Stay where you are. I'll be... I'll be right there. 
 Bob : Okay, I'll stay here. 
 Wait, Harrison! 
 Yeah? 
 Be careful. 
 What's going on? 
 Bob's mother died. 
 Oh, that's awful. 
 Poor guy. 
 What's he gonna do? 
 I... I gotta get over there. 
 I'll come with you. 
 No. 
 Sorry, I-I just... 
 It's okay, I know. Bob doesn't like me or whatever. 
 No, I just think he's... kind of fragile right now. 
 Probably the fewer visitors, the better. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 I guess Rose had been sick a long time, right? 
 Could've seen it coming. 
 I'll bet he's freaking out right now. 
 You're a good friend. 
 Yeah.

 Yes, he will, if he wants to live. 
 He may die either way.

 Odelle : So let's say that I do get him to talk, huh? 
 Then what happens? 
 We keep moving. 
 How many people have you killed?

 The man kills your girlfriend right in front of you, and then he comes to your house, he tries to attack you, tries to kill you. 
 Why is he still alive? 
 You said there were more of them. 
 I want to know how many. 
 Well, five, ten, a thousand. What does it matter? 
 The fact is that you didn't kill him... why? 
 I knew you would have questions. 
 So you dragged a dying man, an Osela, all the way to Timbuktu, to me, because you wanted to be helpful? 
 Yeah.

 Didn't I see you at the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore? 
 Who are you? 
 A friend sent by a friend who said you might be hungry. 
 Just because you know the right words does not make you a friend. 
 If I wasn't, you'd be in handcuffs by now. 
 My name is Peter Decker. 
 I'm a lawyer, a former U.S. attorney. 
 Oh. 
 The Imam thinks that you can help me. 
 I'm a friend of Sophia Tsaldari. 
 Oh! You're  that  Peter Decker. 
 I know about Black Sands, Abdul Abbas. 
 Sophia and I are working to expose SOC's crimes. 
 I wish you luck with that. 
 You were there. You could help us. 
 We have plans to get you safely to Greece. 
 Sophia can protect you. You'll be free to testify. 
 And who will believe me? I'm a terrorist, like Abbas. 
 I know that's a lie. 
 We can show people the truth. 
 A retainer. 
 I'm your lawyer now. 
 Attorney-client privilege, yes? 
 I can tell you anything? 
 Yes, within reason. 
 I'm not a terrorist. 
 But I knew many of them, even Abdul Abbas. 
 You knew SOC was funding Al-Qaeda. 
 It is... how you say... A vicious cycle. 
 Your companies pay terrorists to make war. 
 Your armies invade, create new business, make more war, and so on. 
 I tried to speak out, but the man who framed me is now a U.S. senator. 
 Darnell. 
 I promise you, if he's responsible, we'll make him pay. 
 By the grace of Allah, the senator will pay, in this life or the next. 
 Tell me something, Mr. Decker. 
 What is your biggest fear? 
 Failure. 
 Mine is to disappear. 
 You mean to die? 
 No. 
 No, not to die. 
 To vanish forever, like I was never here. 
 And your country can make that happen to people like me. 
 Black sites, Guantanamo Bay. 
 I will do everything in my power to protect you. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, my new lawyer, I trust you. 
 But I won't agree to anything until I speak to Sophia in person. 
 My cell number's on the back. 
 Sophia and I will meet you wherever you want. 
 There are some things that I have to take care of first. 
 I will text you. 
 Good-bye, Mr. Decker.

 There's no justice in that.

 What? What? What is it? 
 Senator Darnell. 
 That's his justice. He's going after Darnell. 
 Yes, but if he does that, he'll be arrested. 
 He will never get to tell his story. 
 No, he would. 
 The alleged Benghazi terrorist, Ahmed Abu Khattala, is being tried on U.S. soil, accused of killing a United States official. 
 So if he kills Senator Darnell...
