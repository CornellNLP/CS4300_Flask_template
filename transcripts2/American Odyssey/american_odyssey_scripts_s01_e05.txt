 Your mother was a very brave woman. 
 I am so sorry. 
 The Ansar Dine hold my friend prisoner. 
 She is in trouble. 
 I have a friend, he is a gentleman in the Malian army. 
 I got my hands on a document, a transfer from SOC to Al-Qaeda. 
 Joe. I need to light a fire. 
 They killed your father. Any one of us could be next. 
 If you think something happened with your dad, I could help. 
 Omar, I know this man. He's dangerous. 
 Odelle : We're not safe. None of us are. 
 Colonel Glen. 
 Colonel? It's Odelle. 
 I'm alive. 
 [phone ringing] 
 01x05 Beet Feet 
 Colonel Glen. 
 Colonel? It's Odelle. 
 I'm alive. 
 My God. 
 Odelle. 
 But your entire unit was... was... 
 Yes, they were. 
 All of them. 
 But you had... 
 Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm a little banged up, but I'm... I'm fine. 
 Listen, Colonel, you need to understand. 
 The people that attacked us, they were not insurgents. 
 They were Osela. 
 The same people that were sent for SSE after we killed Abdul Abbas. 
 Odelle : Colonel? 
 I hear you, Sergeant, I'm just... 
 You're certain they were Osela? 
 Yes, I'm positive, sir. 
 I can fill in the details at the debrief. 
 Sir, my... my family. 
 Yes, yes, we need to get you home immediately. 
 Will you let them know that I'm okay? 
 Of course. That'll be the first call I make. 
 Thank you, and tell them that I'll call them the minute I get to the embassy. 
 Embassy? 
 Yes, I'm with... I'm with Colonel... 
 General. 
 I'm with General... 
 Diallo. 
 General Diallo. 
 He's escorting me to the American embassy here in Bamako. 
 Isn't that SOP? 
 Not in this case. 
 We need to exercise extreme caution here, Sergeant. 
 Extreme caution. 
 I don't understand. 
 Most of our diplomatic security in the region has been outsources to private military corporations. 
 Osela? 
 Among others. 
 The embassy isn't safe. 
 You need to get... stand by one. 
 You need to get to number nine Avenue Sheikh Zayed on the Fariko River. 
 Can you remember that? Do not repeat. 
 Just say yes if you can. 
 Yes. 
 It's a classified safe house, so you'll have to extricate yourself from the Malians, including that general. 
 Understood. 
 Excellent. 
 Contact me when you arrive. 
 I'll send an extraction team for you ASAP. 
 Copy that. 
 Odelle... you've been brave. 
 Extremely brave. 
 Now it's my job to bring you home. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 You will tell them it was me that saved you, eh? 
 At the embassy? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 [laughs] 
 [pounding on door] 
 Who the hell is David Tenant? 
 Are you crazy? 
 Why don't we just broadcast it on the evening news? 
 You said he killed my father. 
 I've never even heard of him. 
 Your father did. 
 I was able to access his cell phone records from the day he was killed. 
 What? How? 
 You know what, never mind. And? And? 
 Just before he died, your dad made several phone calls to one person outside of his typical pattern. 
 Tenant? 
 Yes. 
 He's a Senior VP at GBR Industries. 
 All right, but what's he got to do with... 
 Okay, I'll get to that, but first we need some ground rules. 
 No reporters, especially that Ruby woman. 
 She... she... she could be helpful. 
 Trust me.She isn't. 
 Okay, no reporters. Go on. 
 Well, like I said, Tenant works for GBR, and GBR provides infrastructure for the military. 
 You know, laundry, recreational equipment, basketball courts. 
 So... ? 
 They do business in Mali. 
 Mali, Harrison, where those soldiers, including Odelle Ballard, were killed, allegedly by insurgents. 
 I... I don't follow. 
 Okay, look it, you tell your father there's a conspiracy in Mali. 
 Right. 
 He talks to Colonel Glen about Odelle Ballard, and then he talks to this guy, who just so happens to do military business in Mali? 
 Wait, in Mali and how many other countries? 
 24. 
 But that's not the point. 
 The... there's more. 
 I hacked into Tenant's email. 
 Bob, you can't just hack into people's emails. 
 The guy uses AOL. 
 What is it, like, 1991? 
 Anyway, Randall emailed Tenant asking him questions about Ballard. 
 Told him he wanted to set up a meet. 
 Tenant agreed. 
 Said there was a lot to talk about. 
 Four hours later... 
 My father's dead. 
 Get in the car. 
 What do you want? 
 For you to stop acting like a lunatic and start answering my questions. 
 Then you will let me go? 
 It depends. 
 Why does the Ansar Dine give a crap about you? 
 What do you have that they want? 
 Look, I have one of them on speed dial. 
 Want me to call him? 
 Fine. 
 [phone beeping] 
 [line rings] 
 It's this that the Ansar Dine want, okay? It's this. 
 That's what they want. 
 Hello. 
 Rasha, it's Amar.

 [I kiss you. See you later.] 
 What's on it? 
 I don't know. 
 Why does the Ansar Dine want it? 
 I don't know.

 Damn it! 
 It's a simple question. 
 Do you work for me, or do you still work for the Justice Department? 
 SOC broke the law. 
 I have to do what's right no matter where I work. 
 No one's telling you not to do what's right. 
 In fact, had you spoken with me first, you would know, not only do I agree with you, but so does Alex Baker. 
 He hired outside consultants to conduct a full investigation of both SOC and Simons-Wachtel. 
 Who are these outside consultants? 
 Chuck Lees and Jack Levy of Morgan Jacobson. 
 You're familiar? 
 Of course. 
 I'd like to speak with them. 
 That's always been my intention, Peter. 
 I hired you for your intelligence savvy and your moral compass. 
 But none of that is useful to us without your trust. 
 I understand. 
 Now you need to repair your relationship with Alex Baker. 
 He's even angrier than I am. 
 Oh, and by the way... 
 I hear you been speaking with Sophia Tsaldari. 
 I have. 
 So far she's not interested in meeting with Mr. Baker. 
 I'm sure you'll persuade her. 
 Harrison : Black Sands. 
 What's that? 
 I don't know. 
 It's got something to do with oilfields in Pakistan. 
 It's weird. There's no final copy. 
 No article with the notes. 
 Well, maybe he never finished it? 
 [phone ringing] 
 Hey, Bob, what's up? 
 So did you find anything? 
 Yeah, so my father mentions Tenant as a source for an unfinished article about Pakistani oilfields. 
 You ever hear of Black Sands? 
 No, but an unfinished article could be the reason Tenant killed your father. 
 Harrison : What's it got to do with Odelle Ballard and Colonel Glen? 
 Uh, nothing yet. 
 But everything's linked, Harrison. 
 Everything. 
 Okay. I should go. 
 Bob : No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 I called to tell that you right now as we speak, Tenant is having lunch at a place called the Edison Club. 
 If you leave now, I can meet you there. 
 And do what? Pull up a chair? 
 He was the last person to speak to your father before he was killed. 
 He's hiding something. I can feel it. 
 So 20 minutes? 
 Okay. 
 So maybe you should go talk to this guy with him. 
 Bob : Wait, hello? 
 Is there... hello? Are you there? 
 Is there somebody else on the line? 
 You know, I'm hanging up. 
 Bob, Bob, it's just... 
 It's just Anna. 
 Hi, Bob. 
 Bob : Oh. Have I been on speaker this whole time? 
 Hey, Bob, thanks for the tip. 
 Really, it's great. So I'll go talk to Tenant. 
 No, no, I don't mind. Wait, but with... with Anna? 
 Yeah, I think it's better.

 Sergeant Ballard. 
 I'm Rich. 
 I'm with the agency. 
 Are you here alone? 
 Yeah, yeah, but... But now you're here. 
 Alive. 
 Not dead. 
 I just need a phone. 
 My daughter's just getting home from school right now. 
 Yeah, I understand, but... 
 How do I get an outside line? 
 You're not... You're not authorized. 
 It's a security protocol. 
 Once you're airborne, you can call anyone you want to. 
 It's just you can't do it now. 
 So... I was supposed to debrief you, unless you need to sleep. 
 No. Let's... let's get it over with. 
 [coughing] 
 Okay, let's start when your unit was attacked by the insurgents. 
 That's not what happened. 
 Of course it is. 
 No, it's not, Rich. 
 I was there. 
 Yeah, well, so was an RK151 stealth reconnaissance aircraft. 
 We've got the entire thing in living color. 
 This is not what happened. 
 It's not us. 
 Are you sure that you don't need to take that rest? 
 And how'd you first become aware of SOC's financial mis-dealings? 
 The IRS investigation. 
 I saw the file. 
 SOC established an improper slush fund. 
 It was used to pay off a drone pilot, Danny Gentry. 
 And how did you get your hands on that IRS file? 
 What... what difference does that make? 
 You know about Danny Gentry, right? 
 The drone pilot who was murdered? 
 How long have you known Joe Abrams? 
 What... what does Joe have to do with it... 
 Let us tell you what we do know, Mr. Decker. 
 There is a cancer here, a financial one, the scope and source of which lies within SOC and Simons-Wachtel. 
 From what we can tell, and this is highly confidential, Joe is the scope and source of this cancer rolled up in one. 
 You're on the wrong path here. 
 Stay with the facts. 
 SOC funded terrorists. 
 A Special Forces unit discovered this, and SOC had them killed by a drone, and when that drone pilot tried to go public, he was murdered. 
 Why are you going after Joe Abrams? 
 Are you aware that Joe Abrams formerly worked at the Middle East investment desk in Riyadh? 
 So what I just told you won't be part of the investigation? 
 We issue our report tomorrow. 
 You'll find that we've been very thorough. 
 [sighs] 
 Thanks. 
 Joe. 
 Hey, hey. I'm on my way to a meeting. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 What, what... whoa. 
 You're being set up. 
 What? What are you talking about? 
 McDonald's is setting you up to take the blame for SOC's payments to Abdul Abbas. 
 Why would I do that? 
 How would I do that? 
 I mean, no offense to any particular ethnic group, but do I look like a terrorist? 
 They need a scapegoat. 
 Wait, who have you been talking to? 
 SOC and Simons are conducting an investigation. 
 Why me? 
 What'd you say to them? 
 Nothing. 
 You told them about the IRS file, didn't you? 
 Jesus. 
 Peter, you're the one that got me involved. 
 I defended you. 
 No, you threw me under the bus and you saved your own ass.

 Harrison. Ah, my condolences. 
 Your father was a good man and a great journalist. 
 You were the last person to speak to him before he was killed. 
 Uh... from what I hear, he was with someone else when he died. 
 Oh, the police got it wrong. It wasn't a murder-suicide. 
 My father was killed because of what he was investigating. 
 On that last call, what were you two talking about? 
 Uh... I don't remember exactly.

 I need to tell you something. 
 When you were first hired, McDonald and Baker told me to keep an eye on you. 
 What do you mean "keep an eye"? 
 Well, they said they weren't sure that you could be trusted. 
 You were spying on me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I really am, but all I did was report back to them, you know, tell them what you were doing. I swear. 
 You told them about Gentry? 
 Yeah. 
 They killed him right in front of me. 
 I know, I know, but they promised they had nothing to do with that. They said... 
 And you believe... you believed them? 
 Well, I never thought they'd go that far. 
 No way. 
 Why are they doing this to me? 
 Hmm? 
 Because they can. 
 You want in so badly. 
 And everyone can see it. 
 How do you think you got on the Middle Eastern investments desk anyway? 
 You know anything about the Middle East? 
 Speak Arabic? Take courses in Middle Eastern economics? 
 Well, maybe I didn't go to Harvard like you or Yale. 
 I'm not judging you. I'm just trying to get you to understand. 
 Hey, look, I get it, okay? 
 I'm unqualified to be in my position, but I worked my ass off, and I thought I was finally being rewarded. 
 Okay? 
 Little did I know, I was being set up. 
 Got to get me out of this. 
 You got to help me. 
 Please. You got to help me.

 Well, you don't look injured. 
 You want to tell me about where you've been? 
 Uh... no, sir. 
 Sorry. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. 
 Everything's fine. Really. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh... thank you, Officer. 
 Yeah, you're welcome. Let's go. 
 Are you okay? 
 You scared the hell out of me. Are you all right? 
 It was Tenant. 
 What? 
 It's okay. He was just trying to scare me. 
 Well, he did a pretty good job. 
 Listen, he admitted it. 
 Tenant knows my father was killed. 
 He knows it. I was right. 
 Hey, glad to know you're okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Sit. Shh. 
 Whoever set you up knew what they were doing. 
 These transactions are impossible to trace. 
 We can't prove that you weren't involved. 
 We can account for every move you made on the Middle East desk. 
 Don't bother. 
 Joe, I think we could build a case for lack of probable cause. 
 I confessed. 
 You what? 
 I did it. 
 I screwed up, and I got in over my head. 
 No, you didn't. 
 Let it go. 
 Let it go. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Fine. 
 Congratulations. 
 I wouldn't have any idea how to hide such a sophisticated transaction. 
 You must have some pretty impressive computer skills to fund terrorism via the deep web, or is it the darknet? 
 What are you calling it nowadays? 
 How about those bitcoins? 
 How'd you figure out how to launder bitcoins? 
 I'm just curious. What was the first step? 
 Did you use a proxy server relay service on a Tor network, an onion router, what? 
 Pete, Pete, let it go. 
 Come on, Joe. 
 You had to ask your assistant how to use PayPal. 
 You know what, yeah, I'm ready to go back to my cell. 
 Can I go? 
 Listen to me. Listen to me. 
 Whatever they threatened you, but I can help you with. 
 Come on. 
 Like you helped Gentry? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 How'd they get to you, Joe? Huh? 
 How'd they get to you? 
 Okay, Alice. Good night. 
 Good night. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 She's fine. 
 Really. 
 I only live ten minutes away if you ever feel like talking. 
 My cell's on the back. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Bye. 
 Good night. 
 Good night.

 Everything's under control. 
 You went to his father's funeral. 
 Just watching my mark. 
 You're protecting him. 
 Getting involved. 
 You've connected to him emotionally. 
 You know me better than that. 
 Good.
