 You killed my father. 
 My future is jail or death. 
 I'm not going to jail. 
 Harrison : No. 
 Baker canceled my deal. I need your help. 
 I'll keep my eyes and ears open, that's it. 
 I want a divorce. 
 In fact, I think it's important that we talk. 
 I am of my people. A protector. 
 Death... it is the only way. 
 Odelle : I defied an order. 
 Not your fault. 
 You have to die. 
 Luc : Gun full of blanks and some blood. 
 Fools them every time. We need to get going. 
 We've got a plane to catch.

 Luc : We're here. Look. 
 Just below us. 
 Beautiful, isn't it? 
 Wow. 
 Pretty amazing, huh? 
 It's incredible. 
 I've seen only pictures. 
 Come on, head down to the sand. Dip your toes in. 
 Whoo!

 You made me jump. 
 You can relax now. 
 No one is hunting you anymore. 
 What's in there, drugs? 
 No. It's a gift for the kids. 
 Never come for a visit empty-handed. 
 So where are we? 
 We're in Algeria, about an hour from Sassel Beach. 
 It's my home away from home. 
 Only accessible by boat or plane. 
 Perfect for my purposes. 
 Last stop before Europe. 
 That's right. I have a boat. 
 It travels to Spain every few days. 
 Full of drugs? 
 Yeah. 
 Lucky for you, you can use it and some of my cargo trucks to find your way to Barcelona. 
 It's where the woman from  The New York Times  told you to meet her now, yeah? 
 Yep. 
 Are you coming? 
 Spain? No. 
 I have, how you say, uh, unresolved issues in Spain. 
 No, my pilot friend will take me back to Mali tomorrow. 
 If you like, I can drop the little thief back in Tessalit for you. 
 Odelle : Tessalit? 
 Did Aslam mention going back? 
 No, I assumed. 
 Why? Do you think you are going to smuggle him to America? 
 Are you adopting him now? 
 Yeah, if I have to. I'm not leaving him here. 
 Oh, you mean living in Africa, where he was born. 
 He doesn't have any family here. 
 He doesn't have any family in America either. 
 Aren't you going to do anything? 
 What would you like us to do, Mr. Walters? 
 I don't know. Maybe just investigate Osela? 
 My father's murder, Ruby Sims or whatever her name is... 
 Rikki Castillo. 
 Was. Right. 
 Her, yeah, she... 
 She killed my father. 
 What are you writing? 
 Am I a suspect? 
 You haven't been charged with anything, no. 
 Oh, great, well, I've been here for three hours. 
 So am I free to go or what? 
 You are. 
 But perhaps we should talk a little bit more about what happened. 
 One last time... 
 Look, I told you everything. 
 Maybe if you guys didn't shoot Ruby, you could be talking to her right now. 
 She would tell you everything. 
 You have a bad scratch on that arm. 
 Oh, it happened when I was... struggling with Ruby and... Rikki. 
 You need someone to look at that? 
 No, I need you to investigate... 
 I need someone to investigate Osela. 
 They're murdering people on U.S. soil with impunity, including my father. 
 Mr. Walters, I assure you we take every lead seriously. 
 [chuckles] 
 But you've been through quite a traumatic ordeal today. 
 You should go home. 
 Get some rest. 
 Anything that comes up, anything else, just call me. 
 [door buzzes] 
 Nice place. 
 As long as you don't put anything in your mouth. 
 Well, you're not exactly someone I want to be seen with. 
 I'll try not to take that personally. 
 So what do you have? 
 Baker's calling the note on Greece. 
 All of it? 
 Now that Tsaldari's Prime Minister, they've decided to hold her feet to the fire. 
 [phone chimes] 
 [sighs] Damn it. 
 I imagine the EU's passing a brick as we speak. 
 Everyone with a spreadsheet and an accent is leaning on your beautiful Greek friend. 
 Word is she's flying in today for an emergency meeting with Baker. 
 The original Maleficent herself, Jenifer Wachtel, is stepping in to mediate. 
 Look, Peter, you put up a good fight, but these people are just too powerful. 
 David and Goliath's a great story, but it only happened once. 
 You don't understand. 
 This fight cost me everything. 
 Odelle : It must be strange being away from Mali for the first time. 
 The cars are all different. 
 And the smell. 
 That's the sea. 
 It's bigger than I thought. 
 [giggles] 
 And colder. 
 Yeah. 
 It's warmer than the water back home, though, I tell ya. 
 See, the trick is you got to get in really, really fast, get over the shock, and then your body just adjusts. 
 Odelle? 
 Mm-hmm? 
 What is the sea like where you live? 
 It's beautiful. 
 It's like this but just different. 
 In the summer, we go to this place called Cape Cod, and we dig for clams and bodysurf. 
 Swim with the waves. 
 Eat popsicles. [chuckles] 
 How does that sound? 
 Sounds different. 
 Different is one way to put it. 
 It's another planet. 
 Tell you what, I'm flying back to Tessalit tomorrow. 
 I'll take you back. 
 We just talked about that. 
 He doesn't have anybody there. 
 How do you know that? 
 Everyone's everyone's uncle. 
 They're all one big, happy family. 
 He's going back to Tessalit. 
 That is not up to you.

 It's the best thing about being dead. 
 Dead.

 I better go find him and talk to him. 
 You mean convince him. 
 Get something to eat first.

 A welcome celebration. 
 For who?

 Oh. 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 I can't believe they shot her, she's dead All right, we have to move on this, all right, 'cause she told me that... 
 That her and Banks, there's something going on between them. 
 Like... they were having s*x. 
 Oh. 
 We need... we need evidence. 
 Like a text or an... an email. 
 Some... they had... They had to talk to each other about things like... 
 Like... like how, uh, how to murder my father. They... 
 They wouldn't send an email about that. 
 They might. They might. 
 They didn't. 
 I already looked. 
 Damn it. 
 What about that Petraeus thing? 
 General Petraeus. 
 He was having an affair with some lady he shared an email account with. 
 They never sent anything over the net. 
 They just read each other's drafts. 
 That way, no one could see 'em. 
 Could Ruby and Banks have done the same thing? 
 That's it. 
 Bob, that's genius. 
 That's genius. All right. 
 Well, maybe. 
 Oh, let... let me. 
 The operating systems on all computers have Bash software. 
 There's a security bug in it that nobody's been able to make a complete patch for. 
 Yet. 
 That may be my workaround. 
 Okay. Good, good, good. This is good. 
 You focus on this and I'll... 
 I'm gonna post to my blog Ruby and, uh, Osela, SOC, even my... my father's murder.

 Yeah.

 Luc, there's Aslam. 
 Luc : He looks fine. 
 Cute girl. He's more than fine. 
 Who is that girl? 
 Does it matter? 
 Look, I know what you're thinking. 
 You created a fantasy about what life would be like for him in America. 
 It's a lie. 
 All this hell that you just escaped, it starts all over again the minute you're back home. 
 They will attack you any way they can. 
 If they can't kill you, they find another way to destroy you. 
 And your family.

 Mr. Decker doesn't work here anymore, and you need to keep your voice down.

 I guarantee he does. 
 I know everything.

 Do you have his home address? 
 Yeah, I do, but I'm not gonna give it to you. 
 Fine. All right, you tell him I'm writing a story on SOC, their connection to murder, to Osela. 
 He's just as guilty as the rest of them. 
 You're that Walters kid. 
 Peter mentioned you. 
 And if you weren't such an idiot, you'd know he's been trying to expose SOC for weeks. 
 That's why he's not here.

 Look. It will take days for the parts now. 
 Son of a bitch.

 Doesn't mean he wants to go to America either.
