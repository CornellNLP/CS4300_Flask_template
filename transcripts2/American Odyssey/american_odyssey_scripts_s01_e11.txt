 Osela. They killed my father. 
 What's the status of Harrison? 
 I have to find the right time. 
 6 p.m. tomorrow, King's Point. Finish it. 
 We know SOC was funding Al-Qaeda. 
 We can show people the truth. 
 But the man who framed me is now a U.S. senator. 
 Senator! [gunshot] 
 I'm looking for an American woman. 
 You brought him to me because you were trying to help them. 
 You will give me the phone number for your Osela contact. 
 [gunshot] 
 You bitch! [speaking foreign language] 
 Now we're both dead. 
 [crowd shouting] 
 [men whispering in native language] 
 You think of escape, but there is none. 
 Odelle : Who are you? 
 I am of my people. 
 A protector. 
 You have killed many. 
 I know that you're angry. I'm an American soldier. 
 But I didn't come to your country to kill. 
 You bring death, Odelle Ballard. 
 No. 
 You will suffer. 
 Why are you doing this to me? 
 Is this Luc? 
 You can't trust him. 
 I did what I had to do to survive. 
 You know what you have done. 
 No, please. That's important. 
 Please don't take that. 
 No, please, don't... 
 I didn't mean any harm. 
 You have eyes, but you do not see. 
 See what? 
 Death. 
 It is the only way. 
 No. 
 [Odelle screams] 
 [grunts] 
 What did you do? Sell her? 
 How much did they pay you? 
 You are a coward. 
 What are you doing? 
 Calling Odelle. 
 She doesn't have a phone. 
 In America. 
 I'm calling her in America. 
 Why are you doing this? The Oselas will come. 
 That's right, genius. Then the Oselas will come. 
 But why are you doing that? 
 It's called an out. An exit. 
 A way through this mess you and your girlfriend have got me in. 
 They will come, they will see I've done their dirty work for them, they will thank me, and then they will leave me the hell alone. 
 How could you do this to her? 
 Oh, yeah, why would I betray Odelle Ballard after all she has done for me? 
 Yes. Why? Explain it to me. 
 Trust me, the way she was going, she would have had us all killed. 
 You don't know that. 
 Death is the only way. 
 I'll be back. 
 [all shouting] 
 The suspect, identified as wanted terrorist Yusuf Ibrahim Qasim, will be arraigned later today for the murder of Senator Thomas Darnell. 
 At this time, we believe the suspect acted alone, but we have stepped up security protocols throughout the New York metropolitan area. 
 Excuse me, how did a known terrorist get into this country and live here for several years without detection? 
 What evidence do you have that Yusuf Qasim is a terrorist at all? 
 And isn't it true that Mr. Qasim was branded a terrorist to silence him? 
 What about the Joint Terrorism Task Force? 
 Nobody had the Jack of Spades under surveillance? 
 Senator Darnell was CEO of GBR Industries. 
 That's all the questions we have time for. Thank you. 
 Yusuf Qasim discovered GBR was engaged in criminal activity in Pakistan. 
 Isn't that why Darnell branded him a terrorist? 
 To silence him. 
 I saw you. 
 The drone protest on Coney Island. 
 So? 
 You were meeting Yusuf. 
 I'm Peter Decker. You're Harrison Walters? 
 Randall Walters was your father? 
 Is that why Yusuf Qasim trusted you? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I'm Yusuf's lawyer. 
 At least I used to be. 
 We need to talk. 
 Give me five minutes.

 You are close.

 But how can you understand death when your blood runs red? 
 Huh? 
 Life is in you. 
 You cannot see unless you die. 
 Ah! Please! Please, no! 
 You're right. He's not a terrorist. 
 So, uh, defense lawyer? 
 Actually, no. I was a U.S. attorney. 
 Why... uh, how did you meet Yusuf? 
 Mutual friend. 
 I was trying to get him out of the country. 
 You said your father was killed because of what he knew. 
 What did you mean? 
 My father met Yusuf five years ago when he was writing a story on GBR Industries in Pakistan. 
 They became friends. He was... 
 He was my father's source. 
 How can I find that article? 
 You can't. It was never published. 
 Why not? 
 Threats. 
 Intimidation. 
 When I told my father about Odelle Ballard's unit being killed in Mali, he started asking questions again. 
 That's what got him killed. 
 [sighs] 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 But if your father was killed because of what he knew, he must have had proof, evidence. 
 Did he have anything on a company called Societel Mining? 
 How does a former U.S. attorney become Yusuf's lawyer? 
 Who was the mutual friend that introduced you? 
 I can't really say. 
 But if your father has anything... 
 Documentation, notes, anything that can incriminate Societel... 
 Who did you say you work for? 
 Currently I work for Simons-Wachtel. 
 Wealth Management. I'm in corporate intelligence. 
 You work for them. 
 I work for investors. Root out criminal behavior. 
 Liability. 
 Or cover it up, right? 
 Why am I even talking to you? 
 You know what? No wonder Yusuf is sitting in jail. 
 Yusuf is in jail because he didn't trust me. 
 I wonder why. 
 Wait. 
 Stay the hell away from me. 
 You've got it wrong. 
 I'm not the enemy. We're on the same side.

 Ruby : Sorry I'm running late.
