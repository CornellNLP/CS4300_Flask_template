 Oh, I made you this. 
 Oh, um, I made you this. 
 I been trying to make contact for years. 
 They still don't want me. 
 Oh, you have a little... 
 Ozzie : You got some information on Jonathan Walsh? 
 Let me grab a pen. 
 Subject number 28409... I'm hearing there's a wrinkle? 
 I'm on it. 
 Good. 
 Because if you can't handle it, we will. 
 Gerry : I've pored over hundreds of cryptic police reports and discovered a distinct pattern. 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 Based on average temperature, the Earth's angle to the sun, and Beacon's longitude and latitude... 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 I've accurately predicted the day, within a window of 2 1/2 hours, when the next visitation will take place. 
 According to my data, nobody who's ever been taken on that day has ever come back, and guess when that day is. 
 Today! 
 Today? 
 And guess who'll be there to greet them. 
 Me! 
 You? 
 So... 
 I thought I'd... give you some stuff to remember me by. 
 You know what? Thanks, Gerry, but why don't you hold on to it? 
 I mean, you're comin' back anyway, right? 
 No! Didn't you listen to anything I just said? 
 Not really. 
 This is a full-time gig. 
 I'm gonna be like the ambassador of the human race. 
 That's why I quit my toll-booth job. 
 Wait. What? You quit your job? 
 No, Gerry, don't quit your job to go chasing aliens. 
 That's what you did. 
 Fair point, but I'm a cautionary tale, man, not a shining example of what to do. 
 That's easy for you to say. 
 You're a member of the group. I'm just a pity member. 
 You're not a pity member. You're... a valuable component. 
 I'm a mascot. 
 You're a full-fledged member. 
 Got your stripes. 
 I can see you made up your mind. 
 Yeah. I have. 
 You can come with me, buddy. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 I'm-I'm actually gonna stay here. 
 I've got some real work that I can do, you know, a real story with real facts. 
 I been chasing a little too long without anything to show for it. 
 Okay, yeah. Whatever, it's cool. 
 But just so you know... Bigfoot's real. 
 Is he? 
 Is she? 
 And yes. 
 I'll write that down. 
 Well, I guess this is it. 
 I'm gonna miss us.

 Yep.

 And after our interaction, I reflected a lot on male privilege. 
 You did? 
 I'm so sorry on behalf of all men. 
 What are you doing later? Do you wanna grab a drink?

 He called Pelosi's office. They're pissed. 
 Aw, damn it. 
 Okay, push the donut meeting. Stall them as along as you can.

 Good, good. 
 You writing any interesting stories? 
 Yeah, the azalea festival just started up. 
 There's 17 different species of azalea that were entered this year. 
 Huh. 
 Is that why you called Nancy Pelosi's office? 
 I'm guessing you don't wanna talk about azaleas. 
 You're goddamn right I don't. 
 Is this about the exposé I'm writing? 
 After all I've done for you. 
 Been a weird boss? 
 Been a confidant. 
 No. 
 A mentor. 
 [Chuckling] No. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 People deserve to know the truth. 
 Oh, you want the truth? You should have just asked. 
 Yeah, Jonathan, I would like the truth. 
 The truth is, I'm a lizard person and I'm part of a global conspiracy to undermine the human race. 
 Isn't that what your little alien support group believes? 
 What are they called, SpaceLosers? 
 The group of which you're an active member? 
 So that's your big plan? 
 You're gonna expose me and... undermine my credibility? 
 Well, I don't have to.

 Wow. You're not foolin' around. 
 Mm-mm. You come into my house uninvited, you've messed with  the  wrong person. 
 Okay, so... 
 You know the day when we were in the truck driving around on the investigation? 
 That was a good day. 
 Right? 
 So... that's what you came here to tell me, Gerry? 
 Uh... no. 
 Yeah. 
 I won't keep you. 
 I just wanted to say that I-I-I really, really like you, I kinda have a crush on you, and I think about you a lot.

 You left him alive? 
 Yep. 
 You know this means we'll have to eliminate both of you? 
 I don't think so. 
 Here's how I see it. 
 You can't kill Ozzie, because his article just went to the paper, and if he ended up dead now, it would look awfully suspicious. 
 And you can't kill  me,  because if you do, there'll be no one left to enter the deactivation code for the files. 
 What files? 
 Oh, you don't know about the files? 
 Ooh. I should have led with that. 
 They're the files that contain everything about our reptilian mission, our identities... all of it. 
 If I don't enter a code every 12 hours, they leak straight to the Internet... boom. 
 Why sacrifice all this for a human? 
 I have my reasons.
