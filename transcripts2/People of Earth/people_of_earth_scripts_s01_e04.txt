 You worked for the Wall Street Journal, New York Times. and you want to work here? 
 I'm interested in all things Beacon. 
 Why do you keep calling me? 
 It would be a shame to see you throw your career away chasing Bigfoot. 
 Did you forget something? 
 I have been working with experiencers for almost six months. 
 I'm not here to talk about my experience, Ozzie.

 [Stool scraping] 
 Someone got a haircut. 
 We've had some complaints about your performance. 
 That it's too good? 
 [Whispering] Ennis! 
 Sorry to bother you at work. 
 Ennis, we talked about this. 
 I'm Crockery Hutch Gina until 7:30 P.M. 
 I know. 
 But my kid drew this in school. 
 That is a picture of me and my family and a spaceship, and I'm being taken away, screaming, "Noooo!" 
 Yeah, that's an accurate description of what this is. 
 But maybe it's more appropriate [Whispering] to talk about this tonight at group, okay? 
 And Ennis, remember, we talked about not bringing food into the Crockery Hutch. 
 I know. I don't listen. I'm a nervous eater. 
 I'm not even hungry. I don't know what to do. 
 Can I maybe just... stay here five more minutes? 
 Sure, Ennis. Five minutes. 
 [Sighs] Thanks, Gina. You're really nice. 
 I'm not here to be nice. 
 I'm not here to hold your hand. 
 I am here to help you face your fear. 
 So, I want you to put down the tissues, I want you to stand up, and I want you to say it. 
 I-I can't say it. 
 Then sing it. 
 Yeah, let's try singing it. 
 Why not? What is your fear? Sing it to me.

 She thinks I'm selfish, just because I won't go skydiving with her. 
 Brian, wake up! 
 Who went horseback riding with you? 
 She did. 
 Who roasted hops for your homemade beer? 
 She did. 
 Isn't it time for you to do something that she wants to do? 
 But she wants me to jump out of a plane. 
 Right, jump out of a plane or jump out of your relationship. 
 That's like 30,000... 
 Are you willing to take a chance? 
 It's about taking chances. 
 All I'm s... 
 And you will live by being in your relationship. 
 We're out of time. I'm so sorry. 
 Ennis : What? 
 I said, "Ennis, your five minutes are up." 
 It's actually been longer. 
 I know, I know. Sorry. 
 I'll see you tonight, okay? 
 And, please, take your pretzel with you. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 How are things lately, Jonathan? 
 Any hiccups? Bumps? 
 Not that I'm aware of. 
 Subject #28409, Ozzie Graham. 
 I'm hearing there's a wrinkle? 
 Oh, I don't know if it rises to the level of a wrinkle. 
 Um, it's complicated. 
 Mm-hmm. Gotcha. 
 You know what else is complicated? 
 Traveling light-years to an inhabited planet, hiding among their dominant species for two centuries, and subverting them from within. 
 The whole reptilian deal. 
 The whole reptilian deal. 
 Right. 
 Does allowing a highly-valued asset to recover his memory and join an alien abduction support group help that plan or hurt it? 
 Well, I think it depends. 
 It hurts it. 
 Hurts it. It hurts it. 
 As evidenced by Kurt's untimely death in the field. 
 Oh, Kurt. That was... so sad... and tr-tragic. 
 He was one of the good ones. 
 So, I'm curious. 
 What steps are you going to take to mitigate the situation? 
 Well, I know 28409. 
 I know his psychology, and I know what'll get him out of Beacon. 
 Me. 
 You? 
 Yes, he hates me. 
 I'm like his kryptonite. 
 I don't know what that is. 
 The point is, I'm on it. 
 Good! Because if you can't handle it, we will. 
 No, I can handle it. We are good. 
 You ratted me out, you bug-eyed little prick! 
 John, you sound upset. 
 Did you have a bad doughnut? 
 I knew it was you. Is this about Kurt? 
 Oh, I don't know. Let me ask him. 
 Oh, I can't, because he's dead! 
 Hey, that's on him. 
 I'd love to chat, but I have to go and do all my dead friend's work. 
 Oh, and one more thing. 
 Eat sh1t! 
 Ha ha.

 Gina : Brian, you can do this! 
 I-I can't do it! Look, I'll do something else! 
 I'll do anything else! 
 You can do it, and you will do it, because I believe in you and you believe in your relationship! 
 Trust me. Without risk, there can be no reward.

 Wizard of Oz! 
 Long time no see! 
 Jonathan, what are you doing here? No! 
 Hey. 
 These buildings are so old. 
 And look at the sky... it's so long! 
 I can see why you love it here. 
 Just out of curiosity, if a New York media executive was thinking about buying a summer home here, what area would he want to be in? 
 What New York media exec... 
 Ozzie! 
 You mean you? 
 Hey, Ozzie! 
 Do you know these guys who are waving and yelling your name? 
 No, they probably think I'm that dude from Hamilton. 
 Happens a lot. 
 Ozzie Graham! Get in here, ya big goof! 
 What, do you got, potato in your ears? 
 We've been calling your name the whole time. 
 Yeah, I... just heard you guys. 
 Like just now. 
 Huh. 
 Oh, hey, who's your friend? Is he an athlete? 
 Ah! Jonathan Walsh, Glint Enterprises. 
 I'm Ozzie's old boss. 
 Richard Schultz, Junior V.P. at Glentech Manufacturing. 
 We make the... The little jacks, at the end of the cord, that gets you on the Internet. 
 Cat 5, USB. You guys make it all possible! 
 Yeah, we do. 
 Wow! 
 Gerry Johnson. Tollbooth. 
 And Ozzie's best friend. 
 Whoa, wait a minute, Gerry. 
 I thought  I  was Ozzie's best friend. 
 Ha ha, you're both wrong. 
 It's actually a guy named Dwayne. 
 He lives in D.C. We've known each other since kindergarten. 
 Dwayne! 
 Ha! 
 Dwayne what a name. 
 So, uh, how do you guys all know each other? 
 Uh, we should get going. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay. 
 We're grabbing lunch. 
 Good to meet ya! 
 Wow. I-I don't know what it is. I like that guy.

 I put butter on my toast this morning.

 Oh, well... this'll be quick. 
 I'm struggling with the emptiness of my life. 
 [Inhales sharply] And I need to buy a throw pillow. 
 Okay, um... well, uh, let's find you a throw pillow. 
 Good. 
 Um, I think the... emptiness thing is gonna take a little more attention. 
 We should probably deal with it tonight in group. 
 Something that goes with my eyes, maybe? 
 OK, so a blue pillow? 
 Yeah, or stripes. 
 Hey, I got to run in here for a minute. 
 A funeral home? 
 Yeah, I need to... pick up some info on the obituaries for something I'm working on. 
 I'm gonna take a while, probably, so you can just go on without me. 
 Oh, no, I'm all good! I got a call to make. 
 I'll be here when you get out. 
 Hey, do you have a... back door in this place? 
 No, why? What's going on? 
 It's my old boss. 
 He followed me up here to Beacon to take me to lunch. 
 I've been trying to ditch him, but he won't take the hint. 
 Dude, you literally just described being a woman. 
 Welcome to my world. 
 He's definitely in the group. 
 By the end of the day, I promise you, he won't be. 
 Let's see. 
 Hmm, not bad. 
 Looks like Magic Mike's business manager. 
 He's walking around here, talking about he wants to buy some property in Beacon. 
 Mm, sounds like he might be in love with you. 
 What? 
 Just saying. 
 That'd be really hot. 
 Also, get me anything you can find on a Gerry Johnson. 
 I could sense he didn't like me. 
 Let's make sure he's not a thought leader in the community. 
 Good. 
 I can't eat that. I can't eat that. I can't eat that. 
 You think they do Paleo here? 
 I'm trying to eat like a caveman. 
 Can I just say how weird all of this is? 
 Ozzie, humans have been eating like this for thousands of years. 
 Not that! You just show up to my office all of a sudden, like, "Hey, it's me, Jonathan Walsh!" 
 Are you in love with me? 
 Whoa! 
 Somebody thinks a little highly of himself, huh? 
 Okay, I've been working on this for a few months, but I can tell you now. 
 I bought the  Beacon Gazette. 
 Like a... copy? Or the whole thing? 
 No, the whole thing. Anyway, the  Beacon  plan is this. 
 We streamline it, we modernize it, and then we make it profitable. 
 It's a win-win. 
 So, you mean to tell me you bought the  Beacon Gazette  'cause you're in it for the betterment of small-town media? 
 Yeah, yeah. I care about small-town media. 
 It's a big thing for me. 
 You don't seem excited! 
 The  Beacon Gazette's  an institution. 
 It's been with the same family for over 100 years. 
 They're not gonna sell it to some rich lacrosse player who wants to be a newspaper mogul. 
 Thank you, Jonathan! 
 Thank you. 
 No. 
 Look at them all. 
 It was like a third-world country in here three hours ago.
