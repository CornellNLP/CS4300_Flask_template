 Kelly : We talked all night. 
 He was an amazing listener. 
 Maybe my alien experience is highlighting some problems in my marriage. 
 Have you ever sought consolation in Christ? 
 Jonathan : You were supposed to wipe his mind, and then implant a memory to mask the entire experience. 
 But he's supposed to have a memory of hitting a deer, not seeing them in his waking life.

 Kelly : Thanks for listening. 
 I haven't felt this comfortable talking to anybody in a while. 
 I feel like I could tell you anything. 
 Thank you. 
 You are an awesome listener. 
 Anyway, what... what about you? 
 What's your deal? 
 I, uh... 
 No one has ever asked me anything... about my deal. 
 Jeff : Damn it! 
 Stupid piece of crap! 
 Garbage stuff that just gets in the way... 
 [Groans] 
 H-hey! 
 Jeff, you seem angry. 
 Just going through our research on 28409, and he's demonstrated a heightened ability to recover memories. 
 Yeah, that's why Kurt put the implant in him in the first place. 
 Well, if you ask me, 28409's a time bomb. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm gonna attempt a manual reset. 
 That's very, very risky. 
 I'll figure it out. 
 I'm pretty technical. 
 [Feedback] Ahh! Mm! 
 [Sighs] Did that do anything? I can't even tell. 
 I'm not sure this is wise with your lack of patience and little fingers. 
 Oh, [bleep] off. 
 You want to be helpful? 
 Kurt's killer is still at large. 
 See if you can track down the car that hit him. 
 It had an "Empathy" bumper sticker. 
 Find it. 
 The bumper.

 Anyway, I just wanted to stop by and tell you that I picked up one of these. 
 Well, that's great. 
 How do you like it? 
 I'm loving it. 
 I actually really, um... you know who I'm digging? 
 I'm digging, um, Mary. 
 Of course, Mary. 
 I don't know. She's great. 
 I just really relate to what she went through. 
 I feel like we're, um... 
 I don't know... I feel like we're the same. 
 Is that blasphemous? 
 No. No. 
 Mary's the best... courageous, small-town girl, a bit of a rebel, rode a donkey nine-months pregnant. 
 And that's a strong female protagonist, actually.

 Okay, uh, I'll let you get back.

 I'm not sure if it's a thyroid thing, or maybe it's low blood sugar? 
 Okay, okay. 
 Here's what you do for headaches. 
 You take children's aspirin, you crush it up, you put it in a club soda, you pour that in your neti pot, and then you flush that through your sinuses. 
 I don't think a neti pot is gonna work for a thyroid condition. 
 Listen, there's not a single thing that a neti pot can't cure. 
 I've got a spare one in my car if you'd like me to get it. 
 I've got to be honest with you, I'm not really aaaaaah... aaaaaaaah...

 Gina : Why? He seemed so nice. 
 Yeah, he seemed nice. 
 Is he not? 
 No, he is. 
 Do you feel like there may be a pattern here? 
 Yeah. Dudes are the worst. 
 Or maybe you're having a hard time sustaining a relationship in the wake of your experience. 
 My experience was kind of great. 
 Well, maybe that's the problem. 
 Maybe everything else pales in comparison. 
 No. 
 I... think it's just that he's very boring. 
 Plus he says "Ore-gone." 
 "I'm going to 'Ore-gone.'" 
 It's Oregon. Yeah. 
 Man #1 : You say Ore-gones. 
 Man #2 : Oregonés? 
 Dump him. 
 You don't say "Al-lab-a-ma."

 Your sipping is killing me. 
 I'm so sorry. [Scoffs] 
 I-I'm sorry. It's just that my head... it's-it's throbbing again. 
 The headaches... they're back? 
 I'll get the neti. 
 I don't know what it is. It... it... Something is seriously wrong. 
 Aliens probably put a microphone in your head. 
 There it is. 
 That's when my headaches started. 
 Thanks for that, but I'm gonna go with something a bit more reasonable, medically speaking. 
 Uh, maybe, like, mad cow? 
 [Auto-tuned] Dude, I think Ennis is right. 
 It sounds like alien dickery. 
 [Auto-tuned] No, I think we're all tip-toeing around the T-word. 
 [Auto-tuned] Microphone? 
 Not "Microphone," Ennis. 
 The T-word. T! 
 [Auto-Tuned] T-Tequila? 
 Now I'm starting to have hallucinations. 
 [Normal voice] Hallucinations? Headaches? 
 That's a tumor. 
 Gina : Maybe... can we not be so free with the word "tumor"? 
 Okay. 
 I... I think I need to go to a hospital.

 Kelly : [Normal voice] Uh, I better do it. 
 I'm his sponsor. 
 No offense... 
 I think I'm gonna have Gerry take me, because he's the only one in this room that is not dressed exactly like me. 
 Uh, okay. You guys better get a move on. 
 Doctor : Okay, Mr. Graham... in a minute, I'm going to ask you to take a deep breath in and hold it. 
 You're doing great buddy. 
 Uh, sir, you're not supposed to be in here. 
 Just stay calm, buddy.

 [Chuckles] It's an intro class. It's open to everyone. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Hello. 
 That seat's saved. 
 That's kind of weird, 'cause I'm already sitting in it. 
 Doug : Eyes up here. 
 So, does everyone understand the Virgin Birth? 
 Yes. That is when Mary has God's baby. 
 That's right. Jesus. 
 It doesn't make sense, because she's a virgin. 
 Well, that's where the miracle of it comes into play. 
 Couldn't she have been lying about being a virgin? 
 That's what Joseph thought. 
 Yes, but he was very, very wrong. 
 Put yourself in her shoes... a divine being shows up in the middle of the night in your bedroom, tells you you're special...? 
 Of course your husband isn't going to believe that. 
 He probably thinks you're just doing this for some sort of attention. 
 But who wants that kind of attention? 
 Who would want that kind of attention? 
 Are... are we still talking about the Bible? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Ozzie : Is it my thyroid? 
 Oh, God. It's my thyroid, isn't it? 
 Someone's been using the Internet. 
 Maybe. 
 If you look here, this little little opaque spot is a mass. 
 A mass? Can you be more specific? 
 Is it a tumor? 
 We don't know. 
 What do you mean you don't know? You're a doctor. 
 I'm not comfortable guessing. 
 Maybe it's your twin. 
 It's not a twin. 
 That does happen. 
 Y... you know what, could you maybe wait outside? 
 Yep. 
 So, this mass... what do we do? 
 Do we run some more tests? Do we wait it out? 
 We'd actually like to remove it. 
 Immediately.

 Well, you could wait, but most people don't roll the dice on brain stuff.

 Gerry. 
 I'm pretty groggy. 
 Doctor : Mr. Graham, you're up. 
 Your operation went very well. 
 Yeah. 
 You'll be glad to know it was not a tumor. 
 Great. What was it? 
 Well, it's funny... it didn't appear as a foreign object on your skin, but it seems to be a tiny piece of metal. 
 Metal? 
 Metal? 
 I said the same thing. I've never seen anything like it. 
 It's, uh, a very uniform. 
 Wait. How did this get into this? 
 I can think of one reason. 
 [Whispering] Aliens. 
 Boop. 
 "What does it mean if I get a signal lost error?" 
 "Subject removed the chip." 
 How could he remove the chip? 
 [Sniffs] 
 What are you doing? 
 I don't want to contaminate it by touching it. 
 Smells weird... like glass. [Sniffs] 
 How did a piece of metal get stuck in my head? 
 It has to be aliens. 
 But why? Mind control? 
 We should take it to a lab. 
 They probably have one here. 
 But can we trust them? 
 How long do you think it would take to drive to NASA? 
 But can we trust them?

 Hi. 
 I don't want to interrupt your crossword puzzle. 
 Actually, I'm working on my homily. 
 Well, um, I just wanted to touch base with you about the, um... 
 [Clears throat] the last class. 
 I feel like things maybe got a little weird. 
 Did they get weird? Did you feel that? 
 Well, I... [Sighs] 
 I mean, you somehow managed to steal the spotlight away from the mother of God. 
 I feel badly about that, but, um... see, something unexplainable happened to Mary, and something unexplainable happened to me, and I guess I was just really excited to... talk to you about it. 
 And the enthusiasm was great, just not super appropriate for that crowd. 
 Yeah, sorry. I think I... 
 I thought this was a book about explaining that kind of thing. 
 Don't worry. I won't be coming back to Bible Study.

 Karl : You're having a hard time connecting to me. 
 Have you ever considered the fact that you're the one who's hard to connect to? 
 No, I haven't, actually. 
 So, I guess we're canceling our trip to Ore-gone. 
 It's Oregon. 
 What? 
 It's pronounced "Oregon." 
 Uh, well, it's not actually. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 And I kind of can't believe that you're correcting my pronunciation right now.
