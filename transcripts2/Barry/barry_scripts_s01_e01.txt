 MAN: Barry. 
 Barry. 
 Barry. 
 Wake up, buddy. 
 - Fuches? 
 - Hey. 
 How long have you been watching me sleep? 
 The money from the Rochester job just cleared. 
 One less bad guy in the world. 
 Nice work, as usual, Barry. 
 Oh, well, he was in bed, so it wasn't work exactly. 
 Then why did it take two days? 
 - Uh, I was doing recon. 
 - Ah. 
 To make it clean. 
 Or... 
 were you laying around the hotel room  like in Sioux Falls last month or St. 
 Paul before that? 
 Look, these extra expenses, they add up, Barry. 
 - Okay. 
 - All right. 
 Oh, God. 
 I'm worried about you, buddy. 
 This sh1t heap looks like the old Barry,  before he had a purpose. 
 BARRY: No. 
 No, no. 
 I think I'm just burned out. 
 You know? 
 Maybe I need a break. 
 - Hey, you know what I think? 
 - What? 
 I think what we should do is shake things up a little bit. 
 You know, so instead of burning another small-town hood  in some snowed-in, rust-belt shithole,  what do you say to a little trip out  to sunny Los Angeles? 
 You came here to give me an assignment? 
 It's the Chechen mob. 
 Come here. 
 A guy by the name of Goran Pazar needs  an outsider to handle something embarrassing. 
 It's great money. 
 Get us a lot closer to where we need to be  to hang it all up someday. 
 When do you think that'll be? 
 The plane for LA leaves in four hours. 
 I will have a car waiting for you at the Ontario airport. 
 Ontario? 
 Wait. 
 Isn't that, like, a two-hour drive? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 You can't just, you know, fly into LAX. 
 You gotta cover our tracks, right? 
 Why? 
 Because it's cheaper or... 
 Fuches: Because it is smarter, Barry. 
 - [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 - How much cheaper was it? 
 [MUTTERS] 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [JET ENGINE HUMMING] 
 [ON VOICE MAIL] 
 Hey, Barry. 
 Fuches. 
 Probably still on the plane,  but welcome to California, buddy. 
 Hey, my guy said he left the car in space 408. 
 I told him you were my best guy, so he should hook you up. 
 He said the car is "dope," so enjoy that, buddy. 
 When you meet Goran, don't be afraid to sell yourself. 
 Remember that liquor distributor  in Canton you stabbed in the nut? 
 I think Gordon's the kind of man  who would find something like that intriguing. 
 - [CAR HONKS] 
 - So work it into the conversation  to make him aware that, you know, you'll go there. 
 - [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES ROAR] 
 - Oh, f*cking... 
 f*cking dick! 
 Hey, man! 
 You must be Barry! 
 I'm NoHo Hank. 
 I trust the flight was good, no? 
 Are you hungry? 
 I mean, do you want a submarine sandwich. 
 If you're thirsty, we've got juice boxes,  Hawaiian Punch, or maybe beer or something. 
 So, we're gonna do this outside, if that's okay. 
 His daughter has some friends over, huh? 
 They're watching their Jessie. 
 JESSIE [ON TV]: Why? 
 Did the bowling alley run out of shoe freshener? 
 We haven't been in LA long,  but we've made a lot of progress:  the harbors, identity theft,  - meth, 99 Cent Stores. 
 - [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
 Business has been going great. 
 Recently, personal matters cropped up,  which needs to be kept separate from the business. 
 So, we called you. 
 This is Ryan Madison. 
 He's a physical trainer in Silver Lake. 
 He works with Goran's wife, Oksana. 
 They've been training together for... 
 What do you think? 
 What do you think? 
 Two? 
 Two, three months? 
 Hmm? 
 Yeah? 
 Over the past few weeks, these sessions became more frequent. 
 Goran asked me to follow her,  and I became aware that they were taking up  at a Holiday Inn in Studio City. 
 I snuck a lipstick camera,  similar to this one, in the room,  and got... 
 this. 
 OKSANA: Harder! 
 Oh, harder! 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Why would I want to see this? 
 Turn that off. 
 - Turn it off! 
 - Come on. 
 I wanted to give him the whole... 
 He gets it. 
 You already said they are  taking up in hotel. 
 Why show footage? 
 NOHO HANK: It's important for him to know! 
 You are just impressed with yourself for planting camera. 
 - I am not... 
 Okay. 
 - Trash that footage. 
 - So, you guys want him gone? 
 - BOTH: Yes. 
 - Good. 
 Okay. 
 - We pay you... 
 No, you don't pay me anything. 
 Fuches takes care of the money. 
 I just need his name and address,  and it'll be done in a couple of days. 
 - That sounds good. 
 - BARRY: All right. 
 Now, there's a lot of ways I can, uh,  [SIGHS] 
 do this for you. 
 Um... 
 One of them... 
 is I could stab him in the nut. 
 That's something I... 
 I did once,  and I am... very comfortable doing it again. 
 - What? 
 - Or not. 
 - Why? 
 - Forget about it. 
 Who would want this? 
 Can't you just shoot him? 
 - Yeah. 
 No, I... 
 - Because being shot is very painful. 
 Have you ever been shot? 
 Huh! 
 I have. 
 It's, like, crazy painful. 
 Anything is better than stabbing guy in nut. 
 I'll shoot him. 
 I'll shoot him. 
 I'll shoot him. 
 Okay. 
 Goran... 
 I think he's going to shoot him.

 Oh, really? 
 Except you don't think you're gonna make it, do you? 
 I mean, that's what you told me. 
 Oh yeah. 
 Last week,  she takes me out for a cup of coffee after class,  starts to cry, snot running down her nose. 
 All of a sudden she said, "I'm not gonna make it."  I'm telling you, I was embarrassed. 
 It was pathetic. 
 Here is a person who's spending her money,  she doesn't have any talent whatsoever. 
 This chick shouldn't even be in this class!

 I mean, we're not here studying  some f*cking TV commercial acting. 
 That's not why you came to LA, is it?

 Look, look, look, something really, really cool happened. 
 - Okay? 
 - Okay. 
 I followed Ryan yesterday,  and he went to this theater to take an acting class,  and I ended up doing a scene with him from True Romance. 
 True Romance is a movie. 
 Yeah, it's LA theater, so I guess all the scenes they do are from movies. 
 The point is, I was really good. 
 And afterwards, I hung out with all of them. 
 - Them? 
 - The acting class, and they're super nice. 
 The whole class? 
 Including the guy you were supposed to burn? 
 Ryan Madison, yeah. 
 No, he's a great dude. 
 And I don't know. 
 They just made me feel  really good about myself, you know? 
 And, uh, you know how you and I talk all the time about my purpose? 
 You think acting could be your purpose? 
 I don't know. 
 I just... 
 I don't... 
 I just feel really motivated  right now or something like... 
 It made me feel really good. 
 Okay, but what about what we do together, Barry? 
 Well, you know, they told me a very small percentage  of actors actually make a living acting,  - you know, so most of them have day jobs, - Yeah. 
 So I just figured, you know, I do night hits  - or something, just... 
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Sit. 
 Sit. 
 Okay. 
 Now, Barry,  acting is a very  face-forward type of job. 
 It... 
 It's a direct conflict  to being someone who anonymously kills people. 
 You want to have a hobby or something, you could take up... 
 painting. 
 - Well... 
 - Hitler painted. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 John Wayne Gacy painted. 
 It's a good, solid hobby. 
 Never got in the way of what they were doing. 
 These are professional actors,  and they're the real deal, and they say I got something. 
 No, I... 
 I get it, I get it, but I think you gotta think this thing through. 
 I mean, you wanna... 
 you wanna go out there and try to burn a guy,  and have him say, "Hey! 
 There's the guy from the chicken commercial!"  I don't know if I'd do commercials. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Barry,  when you decided to do this for a living,  you closed the door on being able to do anything else. 
 You're a killer, Barry.

 - No, no, no. 
 - He lent me a book.
