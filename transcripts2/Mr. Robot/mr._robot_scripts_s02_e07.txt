 It's almost as if something's come alive. 
 My perfectly constructed loop. 
 At 8:00 a.m. breakfast with my friend Leon. 
 At 2:00 p.m. we'll check out a basketball game. 
 Two days a week I go to a church group. You could use some practice. If he's guilty, I could destroy him at a terminal. I told you not to look. Hi, Daddy. Hi, pumpkin. You were drunk, eating shrimp cocktail, and it was raining when you decided my mother would die? If you want to change things, perhaps you should try from within. You want me to convince the class to remove the contingency. You're gonna give me exactly what I want in return. I can't wipe the security footage of you planting the femtocell. Angela Moss. You won't be able to give me anything I want out of life. (CLASSICAL MUSIC) ♪ ♪ (CHUCKLING) Oh, I think so. Oh, oh, Tyrell, Joanna, meet my silent partner in crime, Sharon Knowles. I've heard many good things. And her husband, Scott. How are things? Tyrell here is our new rising young star with an eye on the CTO position. But he's gonna have to wait for Terry Colby's golf career to take off or for an early stroke. (LAUGHTER) Those earrings are stunning. Thank you. Tyrell's always surprising me with little gifts. ♪ ♪ (BABY BABBLING) ♪ ♪ (SIRENS WAILING DISTANTLY) (GENTLE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) ♪ ♪ Capitalistic pig! (BROODING ORCHESTRAL FLOURISH) ♪ ♪ Hello. I see you. I recognize you. I acknowledge your existence. Let's talk. Get to know who each other really are. (PAINED BREATH) All of this is said with a simple act of a handshake between two people. It's not any different than a client connecting with a server. It all relies on that first handshake and naturally grows from there for most people. For me, I can't seem to learn the rules. What happened back there? When you protected me. What was that? I've never seen that before. That was what you needed. Why were you trying to hide him? What are you talking about? Tyrell. (SCOFFS) You were acting like he wasn't in the trunk. But Tyrell was there. I saw him. I thought we moved past this. Let's not go backwards. (SIGHS) What are you so afraid will happen if you tell me the truth? (SLAMS CONCRETE) Why do you want to know so bad? Why do you even f*cking care? I don't want to be in denial anymore. I just want to accept what I did... and move on. Fine. (SCOFFS) I'll tell you. (SIGHS) What's the last thing that you remember? Pop... popcorn. I-I remember the popcorn. (DARK MUSIC) Who the f*ck? ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, would you mind holding for a moment? Thanks. I'll make this quick. I'm Agent DiPierro, FBI Cybercrime Division. We co-opted one of your floors. I was heading to my station when I see you. And it wasn't an "oops, wrong floor" kind of drop-in. From where I was, it looked like you were coming from somewhere. Now, this is nothing official so don't worry, but... I just had to ask, what were you doing on a restricted floor? ♪ ♪ Making plans with Agent Thomas. We were trying to decide drinks tomorrow or lunch today. Where'd you land? Lunch. A Greek place nearby. ♪ ♪ How do you know each other? I'm sorry, is there something else I can help you with? I just really have to get back to this call before lunch. ♪ ♪ You know, this is the honest, "cards on the table" truth, your story fascinates me. The luck... (SCOFFS) To leave Allsafe a week before the company gets hacked and then to end up here at E Corp. It's ironic given your history. Okay, don't freak. She's got nothing. If she did, you'd already be busted. Well, I should quit babbling. I was gonna have you drop by soon anyway. ♪ ♪ Drop by? For what? Just to get a statement, answer a few questions, no big. I'd be happy to. I'm just really busy right now. ♪ ♪ Whatever this is... ♪ ♪ It's not you. ♪ ♪ Okay, final command, ifconfig, space, wlan1, space, up. (KEYS CLACK) ♪ ♪ And there it is. What? We just owned the FBI. ♪ ♪ I did it, didn't I? It was either us or him. How did I do it? Well, you... the guy was f*cking batshit. He was raving about killing some woman and... the wonder of it all. I mean, we were gonna be next. How did I do it? After I ran the scripts, he went off on us being gods. ♪ ♪ The popcorn, that's where Darlene said she hid that gun. And I didn't want to, but... I shot him. (GENTLE AMBIENT MUSIC) No. ♪ ♪ I shot him. ♪ ♪ Harder. Harder. (BED SPRINGS GIVE) ♪ ♪ (BARELY AUDIBLE) Harder. I told my friends you're coming. You know that can't happen. I thought this was our celebration. We love each other. What's to hide? (SCOFFS) Derek. I mean, how many times do you get to turn 30? Either come to my party tonight as my girlfriend or we're done. ♪ ♪ Pull up two hours ago. (MOUSE CLICKING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MOUSE CLICKING) (SIGHS) Last week, any day. (MOUSE CLICKING) The entire archive's corrupt. Call the network team. You guys just got hacked. I'd sweep the 23rd floor and check Angela Moss's computer. You won't find anything... I'm sure she erased all traces... but check anyway. Where you going? It's Fourth of July tomorrow. I'm gonna find a barbeque to be miserable at. (THE CRAMPS' "GARBAGEMAN" PLAYS) ♪ ♪ ♪ You ain't no punk, you punk ♪ (OVER TV) Trash pile-ups have now become a real epidemic in the city. Due to the credit crisis brought on by Five/Nine, many private businesses cannot afford waste management services, which has sparked a cottage industry of roadside garbage burning at discounted rates. The Taxi and Limousine Commission asks that drivers now accept Ecoin. Per the Taxi and Limousine Commission, payment can be made via mobile phone. Just download the Ecoin app from the Play Store or App Store, scan the QR code once you reach your destination, and the payment will be withdrawn from your Ecoin Wallet. (SONG CONTINUES OVER TAXI RADIO) You had me worried, not answering my calls after all that went down. I'm gonna go. You weren't the target. Cisco was just trying... Stop. I know you already put the rest together, so... no more smokescreens. Okay, ask me anything, I'm an open book. I owe you that. You guys always thought that you were smarter than me. But come on. You never actually hid it that well. Every Halloween, when we were kids, you and Elliot always made me watch that shitty scary movie. It was so bad. And all these years later, I'd kind of forgotten about it. Even when the masks started popping up in those videos. I didn't place it at first. (SIRENS WAILING) Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't want to. I mean, come on, that's crazy, right? That you guys would... (SIRENS WAILING) Had enough alone time down there to get your head right and do what needs to be done? Speak up. Yeah. You believe him? Yeah. Okay. This is how it's gonna go. (OMINOUS MUSIC) You gonna sit your ass right here until you do what you got to do. Once the site's up, you gonna crawl back into your hole until we're sure this baby's purring like a kitten. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (MOUSE CLICKING, KEYS CLACKING) How long is this gonna take? A few hours. Once he gets what he wants... Right now he needs me. So that makes us safe. ♪ ♪ (KEYS CLACKING) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) ♪ ♪ What's with the looks? Mm. ♪ ♪ And this is happening tomorrow? Mm-hmm. (DOOR UNLOCKS, OPENS) (FOOTFALL) Hello, Derek. You never showed up. Told you what would happen if you didn't show up. No-no-no-no-no, that's not gonna work anymore. You've been messing with me for way too long. I should've known somebody that I met working at a stuck-up E Corp party would be bad news. Meeting you at that party changed something for me. I'd be lost right now without you. What you want, I want it too. I was busy tonight because I was hassling my lawyer on holiday to do this. It's my birthday gift to you. Holy sh1t. We're getting more traffic than ever. Says our Bitcoin intake doubled since we've been up. 200,000 we could have made while we were down, that's on you, boy. It's time to go back to your cage, shitbrick. What about a game? Old time's sake. Give me and Elliot a minute. Wait outside. All right, set it up. Thank you. For what? When we first met, I thought I was helping you. I thought I was gonna be your savior. I didn't tell you about my wife. She was so smart. Way smarter than me. She was like you, real good with computers. That's what she did for a living. So when she had this idea to do a site, it sounded good to me. I don't think she ever meant it to go where it went. She was wanting to make some extra scratch. But the thing grew so fast, it took on a life of its own. And the money, well... We're talking about the type of money that makes you question right and wrong. So, you know, we made a deal. Decided we'd let the market dictate what was sold on the site. And we wouldn't look. She was better at the denial than me. It ate at me, all the things I imagined were going on. I feared the worst. But I still didn't look. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Not until you came along. ♪ ♪ After I found out what was on there, what we did to you, what we did to RT, it was weak. Way back when, when I said it was about stumbling, I was wrong. ♪ ♪ I should've taken a f*cking stand. ♪ ♪ You are my answer. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) It's not the other way around. ♪ ♪ So thank you. (EXHALES) (SNIFFS) ♪ ♪ (SIGHS) ♪ ♪ How much time do I have? ♪ ♪ Come on, man. We both knew exactly what you were gonna do when I let you go back on that computer. ♪ ♪ With their response time, I would guess they have us surrounded by now. ♪ ♪ You better get out before they get up here then. World champion chess master Emanuel Lasker once said, "When you see a good move... look for a better one." ♪ ♪ Elliot. ♪ ♪ Be careful. (SIGHS) ♪ ♪ (DOOR OPENS) ♪ ♪ I gave Ray the chance to make the right move. And he left himself wide open to me. (SIGHS) (SIRENS WAILING DISTANTLY) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (AMBIENT INDUSTRIAL MUSIC) When I completed the migration, I also took it upon myself to open the site to more than just TOR traffic. Stay right here and don't move. Just had to index it on a few search engines and with the added touch of adverts on the top advertising sites, and now it's accessible to any average scumbag that Googles "Thai girls for sale." Didn't take long for the FBI to catch on after I emailed them an anonymous tip. Mr. Robot was a part of me that I created because of my pain. So now we have a chance to start again. Our handshake negotiated us as partners. (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (INDISTINCT TALKING) The House will come to order. (GLASS SHATTERS) (THUD) (CROWD COMMOTION) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) ♪ ♪ 
 
 There has been much mystery surrounding the vandalism and castration of the Wall Street bull. That mystery was solved when the missing anatomy of the bull crashed through a skylight of the House chamber. Police, FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security have begun a full-fledged manhunt for those parties responsible. You haven't answered my calls since the weekend. As you can see, it's busy. Ever since this bailout fiasco yesterday, these kits are flying off the shelves. The, uh, end of civilization is near, so this is gonna have to wait. I can settle the lawsuit. Stay out of that. The lawyers are handling it. E Corp will settle. But there's a contingency with the independent inspections. If we drop it... I'm not discussing this with you. If you drop the independent inspections, they will settle. Did... did your boss put you up to this? Look at what's happening. Who knows if this company will be around long enough to see this case through? Drop the contingency. You'll get your money. The inspections are there for a reason. Do you want what happened to your mom to happen again? I'll make sure the inspections go forward internally. (SCOFFS) Is that how they're suckering you? Trust me, they value me over there. (LAUGHS) You laugh, but they respect me. I don't know who this person is who's in front of me, but I'm not agreeing to any of this. I don't trust them. And to be honest? I don't trust you. Besides, you think anyone else is gonna want to sign on to whatever you're selling? It's not just my vote, it's the whole class. You need 2/3. I already got the signatures. That's the trick about money. Banks care more about it than anything else. What exactly is in this for you? You aren't getting the money. I am. You know that, right? So I'll ask you one more time. Why did you come here? Because you certainly didn't give a sh1t about my opinion. This was just a courtesy. Two weeks and it's done. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Now this Ray thing got everyone talking. I didn't have anything to do with that. Lying ain't your friend right now, cuz. Everyone got their eyes on you. Half of them love you. Half of them want to kill you. Other half just want to twist your sh1t up. But you know, it's that last half I'm worried about for you, bro. Hey. Little man, book it real quick for me. I'm good here. What's that? Didn't hear you. You heard. (SCOFFS) f*cking bravery is contagious. I suggest you talk to your boy. He's fine where he is. Ray's site. I had 800 Bitcoins in my wallet. Now, all of a sudden, I got no access. Can't even make new sales 'cause the site's down. All of this is on you. So the way I see it, you're paying me back. We'll get some one-on-one later on. (PLAYERS CHATTERING) Just remember, cuz, sitting under the Sword of Damocles. Out of the blue, I received a call from my lawyer. Seems the contingency on our biggest lawsuit was miraculously dropped. Care to explain? It's what you wanted, isn't it? I remember telling you exactly the opposite. You just didn't want to ask for it. But it is what you wanted. You gonna take the offer then? Well, it's not for me to say, officially, but... despite the fact that we're hemorrhaging money at the moment, settling this would be a lot cheaper than dealing with the legal expense. Can I ask why it was so important for you to drop this contingency? You protecting some evil, secret agenda? Aren't we all protecting our evil, secret agendas? In that case, here's mine. One of the things that Terry Colby said to me when I took this job was I could make changes from within. I want my position moved to the Risk Management Department. There's a manager position available. And even though I may lack the experience, I think you know I can more than make up for it with drive and quick learning. That's how you choose to squander the capital you've just earned... You're aware that's a lateral move? It's what I want. And I am asking. It's my birthday today. Did you know that? No. Hm. I thought... No, no... Don't believe what you read online. Today is my actual birthday. I never share the real one with anyone. Some things I like to keep to myself. Happy birthday then. (CHUCKLES) Would you like to celebrate with me? Tonight? No. Well, maybe next year. Wither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them,  and dwellest in their land. Amen. All : Amen. I wanted to tell you I'm sorry. For my outburst last month. Can you let go of me, please? I know you're afraid, but the fear you have is a right one. It means you'll be forever vigilant. You want to know how I know? I've seen you talking to Him. Not out loud, but I could tell. It's written all over your face. It's not crazy, Elliot, it's very normal. You've seen me talking to him? Yes. But you don't have to keep it such a secret. When you let Jesus into your heart, He'll always listen. Tell you what, I'll give you some alone time. (AMBIENT MUSIC) ♪ ♪ I need your help. I've been lost these past few weeks. Since the whole Ray thing. I need to finish what I started. With Evil Corp. But I don't know what to do. ♪ ♪ Why did you first start listening to me? When I sent you that note on the server at Evil Corp, something inside you told you to listen. And you did. Followed me off the subway, came to fsociety, and then you... not me... led us to hack Evil Corp. I didn't force you to do any of it. It was all you. Your choice. Truth is, I just followed your lead. People want to follow you, son. Why? Same reason why you led the entire world into a revolution. Because you are a leader. ♪ ♪ I don't want to be a leader. You asked me how to finish this. That's what you need to do. You need to lead. (PHONE RINGING) And not unlike your floor, coffee machine, file room. People in this bullpen, these are your risk management coordinators, you'll be working with this team. Put out risk reports, analyses, and you report everything out to me. After Five/Nine, almost all of our time is dedicated to helping the crisis response team. That's what we do here. Our internal investigation team make recommendations to management about ways to address the crisis and course correct. Need you to be smart. Think outside the box and be discreet. You get in; you get out; assess the situation quickly; find answers; figure out ways to limit damage. I'm giving you access to the case we're working on now. It's a class action lawsuit brewing in Flint over water contamination. Nothing public yet, but could be big first quarter, 2016. Do I just go into the file server to access that? I'll have IT run you through everything. Setup, Outlook, Calendar. (DISTANT INDISTINCT CHANTING) You knew Gideon Goddard? We worked together on a couple projects when he was a vendor. It's terrible what happened to him. Well, why don't you go ahead and get yourself up to speed? I'll check in once a week. Let me know if you need anything. (OUTSIDE CHANTING CONTINUES) Can I sit in on the daily debrief meeting? (SIGHS) Look, that's, uh, that's a director-level meeting. We don't really invite managers to that. If I could just sit and listen it might help me get up to speed faster. I want to make sure I can add value as soon as possible. All right. It's later this afternoon. I'll send you an invite with the details. Did you get in okay this morning with these protestors out here? (INDISTINCT CHANTING) (CHUCKLES) It's crazy, right? I was on a route to cure myself of Mr. Robot. The regiment was supposed to be that path. (TENSE MUSIC) I never thought the regiment would be the thing that would lead me right back where I started. People always told me growing up that it's never about the destination. It's about the journey. But what if the destination is you? What if it's always you? ♪ ♪ Hey! (MUFFLED) Help! (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (GROANS) I heard you got a problem. You know what else your problem is? Too much courage. Just like your nigger friend. He might tell you it's a good thing, but it ain't always. It makes you have errors in judgment. (STRAINS) But I'm gonna do you a solid. I'm gonna fix that courage problem of yours. (BLOWS LANDING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Okay. We should break that brave, little soul of yours, homey. (CHUCKLES) You could've avoided this if you'd just given me my money. Think about that. Think about it. Think about it. (GROANING) No, no! (PAINED GROANS) Gonna get a letter on Tuesday. Do what it says. (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) Hey, yo, man, when you see Whiterose, make sure you say I did you good. (GROANS) I'll be rooting for you, cuz. Always. Usually, they feed us. It's one of the only reasons to come to these meetings. Should we go ahead and start? It doesn't look like Susan's gonna make it. Is there any reason to have this meeting without her? The economy must really be in the shitter if Susan Jacobs finally decided to take her vacation days. First order of business is the small independent loan companies we're servicing. I'm surprised they're not suing us for breach of the uptime clauses. I have three class actions on that point alone in my region. Contractual damage on uptime are minimal. I'm not even worried about it. We'll settle. But we should discuss those when Susan comes back. Maybe it would be helpful if I put together a summary of how we've... handled past cases. To see if there are any patterns that might help us figure out how to address this issue. If we pull milestone cases like Dakota Fracking and Washington Township, I could put together a summary briefing. All I would need is access to the files and then I could get working on that right away. (SIGHS) You know what? There's not much we can do here today. Food never came, Susan's out. Let's adjourn. Didn't I just say that two minutes ago? We're really leaving before the food? I said adjourned. I know who you are. You did what you did to get a job here. You sucked whoever's dick to get transferred here. And, frankly, I don't really care. This is a favor to Price. You know what he told me, when I asked him how I should deal with you? He said, and I quote, "However you want." Enjoy the shrimp cocktail. This is good news, don't you think? But you're not happy about it. I'm not sure. When did you get it? This morning. How are your interactions with him? For the first time, we trust each other. I help him, and he helps me. Since I've been at my mom's, I wanted to get rid of him. But you were right. You can't destroy a part of yourself. Elliot, I need to ask you a question. Where do you think you are right now? What do you mean? Elliot, you know you haven't been staying with your mother, right? (OMINOUS MUSIC) I know. (ALARM BUZZING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) When you get released, I hope you continue seeing me in my office. I think it's important we maintain our regular schedule. Don't you agree? Yes. (GENTLE POP MUSIC) Mr. Robot was right. ♪ ♪ Control can sometimes be an illusion. But sometimes you need illusion to gain control. ♪ ♪ Fantasy is an easy way to give meaning to the world, to cloak our harsh reality with escapist comfort. ♪ ♪ After all, isn't that why we surround ourselves with so many screens? (UNINTELLIGIBLE) So we can avoid seeing? So we can avoid each other? I don't think I'm ready to talk about it just yet. So we can avoid truth? ♪ ♪ I'm sorry for not telling you everything. But I needed this in order to get better. ♪ ♪ Please don't be mad too long. This will be the last time I keep things from you. I promise. ♪ ♪ I know what you're thinking, and no. I didn't lie to you. See you in the morning. All of this really happened. This was just my way of coping with it. But now, I'd like it if we could trust each other again. Let's shake on it.
