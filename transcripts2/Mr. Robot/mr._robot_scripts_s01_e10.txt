 Come on! Will you... will you go? Come on, go, go. 
 Hey, you cheated on your current wife with seven different women. 
 I got digital proof of all of it. And if you don't stop seeing Krista, your wife will know everything. 
 Done. 
 And one more thing. 
 I'm gonna need something from you. 
 I don't just hack you, Krista, I hack everyone. 
 So I gotta be honest, I was impressed by you. 
 I think I can land you a pretty lucrative gig. 
 Who are you? 
 That'll come later. 
 Elliot, listen to me. I will never leave you. 
 I will never leave you alone again. 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Since last month, Evil Corp has moved its tapes to five... 
 Five backup facilities and you have a plan to take them all down. 
 Why are you working with us? 
 [beeping] 
 The hack, everything, maybe we shouldn't execute it. 
 Why? 
 The minute our infected server gets back on the main network,  we're set. 
 Scott will continue here, What the hell are you... Shh. I don't know what your grand plan is, but I need to, and you're going to tell me. Why did you do it? What did you hope to accomplish by doing all of this? I wanted to save the world. Hey. It's so good to see you. You look great. Can I get you a drink? Look, Michael, I don't... Jesus. I forgot. It's not even your real name. It's, uh... Lenny. Lenny. So tell me what's going on. How advanced is it? I already emailed my friend at Sloan Kettering. If it's as serious as you say... Krista. Krista. Then she wants to... Look. I'm not dying. You're a sick m*therf*cker! Look, hold on. It's the only way I could get you to meet up. Don't you ever call me again, even when you are dying. One of your patients hacked me. Some kid. His name's Elliot Alderson. I went to the police already. Please sit back down. We need to talk about this. Here. The police had their cyber crime division look into it. They've been trying to track him down for the past six weeks. What is this? That proves it was him. He took my dog to the vet. Look. See, she was microchipped, and I gave her chip number to all the vets in the city. This sick fucker not only hacked me and ruined my life, he stole my dog on top of it. This guy's certifiable. I mean, he's seeing you, so technically he is. What did he do to you exactly? He made me... you know... say all those things to you. This kid should not be allowed to do what he did. He hacked into my private life. And then that Ashley Madison leak happened. My wife found out about everything anyway. After the whole thing, she left me. I can't even see my little girl. The divorce is... is a nightmare. I don't give a sh1t about your divorce. Look, if he's doing this to me, then he must be doing this to other people. Think about it. If he knew enough about me to hack me, then that means he must have hacked you, too. He did, didn't he? I can't talk about this with you. Hey! You have to help me catch him. The dog thing alone isn't enough. My buddy says this Computer Abuse and Fraud Act is tough to prosecute. You need a lot of evidence. This kid is good, Krista. He was routing through something called proxies or something out in Estonia. He's untraceable. Short of that whole country falling apart, we're never gonna get our hands on any real evidence. Just what exactly do you think I can do? Maybe he said something. You know, in your sessions. Oh, come on, don't give me that privileged information bullshit. This guy's committing a crime, a serious one. He deserves to go to jail. If you know something,  if he said anything, you have to tell me. Look, I'm not the enemy here. He is. We were a good thing. Remember? I mean, don't you remember this place? We had some good times here. Come on. Don't stay mad at me. I really loved you. He never told me anything. I can't help you. The asshole stole my dog! [sighs] The response to the Japanese and Chinese stock markets has provoked panic, setting off the downward trends of the European stock exchange. But what's even more worrisome is that the IMF has no leverage against these defaults. Already, 17 governments are said to be in large-scale crises with some on the verge of collapse. Among the countries are Lithuania, Croatia, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Estonia. This faction has deemed the hack inflicted upon the world's largest conglomerate as an opportunity for reform and a chance to start anew, building more egalitarian economies with lessons learned from decades of economic disparity.

Okay, everyone, lay off! I'm sure he had his reasons. Besides, whatever. The point is, it worked. Jesus, what did I do? We need to clean up and get the hell out of here. Were you there? Did you see it? What did I do? Elliot, what's going on? You disappear on me at the apartment and come here to execute without even telling me. Execute. It executed, but how?

I'm just gonna call it, Gideon. You have to shut down Allsafe. Maybe I can just buy some time. We could bounce back from this. Gideon, your number one client is in the middle of a major crisis. You can't escape the fallout from this. As your part-time CFO and your friend, I have to be honest and tell you, this is beyond bleak. [scoffs] When is it not? I'm sorry? Ever since I started this company, it's felt like we've just been rearranging chairs on the goddamn "Titanic." When was the last time you and I have not had a depressing conversation? Gideon, I handle the money. It's always gonna be a depressing conversation. Best thing you can do for them is to let them know soon so they can find other jobs. And... What? All their 401(k)s were tied up in the market... [sighs] Which is expected to plummet once the bell rings. Well, that's only rumors at this point. [sighs] What? Seems to be a little more than rumors. Every bank is essentially affected. I know I couldn't use any of my credit cards over the weekend. Could you? Well, I don't know. There might be a silver lining to all this.

Not how I pictured it. ♪ ♪ I wonder what stage they're at. Denial? Muttering to themselves? No, this can be fixed. Maybe bargaining, forcing their techs to work overtime to try to decrypt our data.

We are cutting live to the video right now. Evil Corp, we have delivered on our promise as expected. The people of the world who have been enslaved by you have been freed. Your financial data has been destroyed. Any attempts to salvage it will be utterly futile. Face it, you have been owned. We at fsociety will smile as we watch you and your dark soul die. That means any money you owe these pigs has been forgiven by us, your friends at fsociety. The market's opening bell this morning will be the final death knell of Evil Corp. We hope, as a new society rises from the ashes, that you will forge a better world, a world that values a free people, a world where greed is not encouraged, a world that belongs to us again, a world changed forever! And while you do that, remember to repeat these words. We are fsociety. We are finally free. _ We are finally awake!

I didn't mean anything by it. - I was just trying to... Never mind what you meant. Just do as I say. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you. It's been a long day, and... and I'm not used to all the new faces around here. No problem. Four minutes, people! Let's get last looks. Let's go. So anyways, this should fry anything and everything to a crisp. You're in luck. My boss is at the bank. Seems like everybody's lining up this morning. So you got some time. Jesus, are we really doing this right now? Hey, I don't need no judgment. Not like I want to be here either. Sorry, dude, I got no sympathy. You don't want to put cute puppies out of their misery, you don't have to. That's just sick. That ain't on me. I gotta pay the bills. That's the only reason why I'm here.

 And, Sarah, we've had meetings all weekend handling the situation. I'm being told by our network storage team that they are in fact getting to the bottom of this. Mr. Plouffe, have you seen the latest stock price? It's hitting an all-time low of $18, and it's still dropping. How are people reacting to this on the inside? Almost $400 billion of wealth was lost today. That's pretty astounding. Are you concerned? That's an interesting question. But right now we're focused on tackling the technical issues at hand. We have loyal customers who are suffering, and our number one priority is to address their needs. We had one of our experts in here earlier today. They're saying that if, in fact, fsociety's claims are true... [whispers indistinctly] Your data is inaccessible and could prove nearly impossible to recover. And given that there does seem to be some legitimacy to this... The White House is with us on this. They're gonna protect everyone's money. [chuckles] The bottom line is the public does not need to worry about this. Mr. Plouffe, this was a massive attack. All of your servers, including your data center in China as well as your offline backups have been destroyed. I'm not really sure you can ask the public not to worry. You want me to be honest? Of course. You're right. Absolutely right. The public should be worried. I mean, personally, my life is over. [indistinct chatter] What's happening? My pension, savings, everything... has been in this company since I started here,  and that's all gone now. Truth is... I've been with the engineering team all weekend. This has to stop.
