 Dark Army told me stage two is ready. 
 I know he's dead. I know this isn't real. 
 I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 
 People have been forging paper records. 
 We haven't set up a system to verify these sorts of claims. 
 Rebuilding our database is the only solution to this problem. 
 Immunity is on the table in exchange for a name. 
 That's all I care about. 
 We have to talk to them. 
 They can't do this after what happened last night. 
 What, that some Mexican restaurant got shot up? 
 We can't let them get away with this. They're going to get away with this. Promise me you'll let me do the interview. You've been messing with me for way too long. It's my birthday gift to you. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You know, of all the gifts he sent,  this is the greatest we ever received. I have to know what you're planning. We were meant to be allies. We might just want the same thing, and I need to be involved. I am pretty positive you're dead wrong about that, my friend. I don't think there's anything we could possibly agree on. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Seems you've been very busy lately. I have to know what you're planning. We were meant to be allies. We might just want the same thing, and I need to be involved. I'm pretty positive you're dead wrong about that, my friend. I don't think there's anything we could possibly agree on. I don't know what game you're playing, but I suggest you cut the bullshit. If there's nothing else, I think we're done here. Aren't you forgetting that I know your dirty little secret? There are people close to you that wouldn't be happy if they knew what I know. (TENSE MUSIC) ♪ ♪ We're both too smart to allow pettiness to dictate our actions. We're better than that. Weigh the pros and cons. Do what you need to do.

In fact, you'll realize that the only thing to do in your position when it comes to me is nothing. (TENSE MUSIC) ♪ ♪ Elliot! (THUNDER RUMBLES) I believe in fate. There's a reason we met. There's something between us. I can see it. ♪ ♪ You're only seeing what's in front of you. You're not seeing what's above you. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (SEAGULLS CRY) I don't understand, I... I want to.

(CLUNK) It's one thing to question your mind. It's another to question your eyes and ears. But then again, isn't it all the same, our senses just mediocre inputs for our brain? Come on. Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us, but what if the haunting truth is, they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at all but just our mind's best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a fuzzy picture we will never truly make out. So this is where you've been staying? God, no. We're only operating from here. Dark Army set this up? They're our partners. Of course they set this up... for us. We needed a discreet place. Discreet? You're the most wanted man in the world, and you're walking around like that. You really don't remember this, do you? Because I'm not the one who set this up. We've been through this already. It must have been him. Mr. Robot. (TENSE MUSIC) ♪ ♪ (SIGHS) Elliot... I need to know. Are you able to handle this or not? You're here under great risk, not only to me, but to our plan. And your, um... disposition is very much concerning me. Joanna. ♪ ♪ Your wife. She's been looking for you. I'm doing what's necessary. (HUMMING, BUZZING) Thank goodness they've given us these UPSes for the power surges. Ready to look at what we accomplished? ♪ ♪ Wanna take your jacket off, hon? Don't call me hon. I just meant you have some blood on there. I had some too, on my shirt. I know what's on my f*cking jacket. I'm sorry for the loss of... I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and respectfully decline to answer any of your questions. I'm not asking a question. I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am for the loss... I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and respectfully decline to answer any of your questions. I know you guys were close. I'm sorry you had to lose him. He was involved in one of the most notorious hacker rings in the world. Things like this come with the territory. I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and respectfully... You keep trying to invoke the Fifth Amendment, but there's this thing called the Patriot Act that a bunch of people signed into law. You know what that means? It means that you are not on some TV show. This isn't "Burn Notice." There are no blue skies for you out there. Characters like you are not welcome here. As far as anyone's concerned right now, you're an enemy combatant. You don't have any rights. What the f*ck do you want me to tell you? I meet my boyfriend. We go eat. He gets shot. End of Q&A. Give me a sec. (BUZZER) You're gonna want to talk to me. We're not so different. We're both Jersey girls. I know it's hard for you to believe this right now, but trust me, by the end of this day, you and I are gonna be best friends. Of all the gifts you've been sending me, I've got to say, this one got me the wettest. this one got me the wettest. So... I'm waiting. What? The phone calls... the gifts. Make me understand. I bet you feel all high and mighty right now. That right? Do you think you're a powerful man, Scott? Do you feel powerful? (SLURRING) I am the CTO of the largest conglomerate... I'm not interested in your job title. I want to understand what would make a powerful man like you... risk everything... all so he could drive me crazy? What does it matter? The morning I learned that I was promoted to CTO, I get the call. Price wanted to hold an event that night to announce my position. I thought, "I couldn't be any happier." And then Sharon walked in. She had made a... a doctor's visit... and wanted me to go with her. She had found out a month ago she was pregnant. Didn't talk. I didn't know if she was... happy or sad... or if I was happy or sad. But when we first saw that sonogram... We lit up. I thought, uh... (WEEPY LAUGH) this is gonna end up being the best day of my life. (CRYING) (CLEARS THROAT) After the funeral, I didn't know why... I couldn't understand how I could... gain and lose everything... In one fell swoop. I wanted you to feel what I felt. I wanted to give you hope that I could step on! (SOBBING) But I'm sorry. (SOBBING) Ohh... You pussy. You piece of sh1t. I hope you rot in hell like your wife. You're mourning a woman who, after she found out she was pregnant, was gonna f*ck my husband's brains out. I'm glad she's dead. f*ck her and her fetus corpse. (WORDLESS YELLING) (CRASHING AND BANGING) Aah! (GRUNTS) (GASPING) (STRAINED) No wonder your wife was gonna cheat on you. You're weak and pathetic. That child's lucky to be dead. (GRUNTING) (DARK MUSIC) ♪ ♪ (GAGGING, WHEEZING) No... (WHEEZING) (SCOTT THUDS, OBJECTS CLATTER) Oh, my God. (COUGHS) Oh, my God, what have I done? (GAGS) (WHISPERS) Oh, my God. My God... (GASPS, COUGHS) (TELEPHONE BEEPING) (LINE TRILLING) (GASPS) (WHEEZES, COUGHS) 911. What's your emergency? Vincent had a punctured lung and a broken collarbone, but the doctors say he's gonna recover. The bad news is, he's gonna be arrested and put away for a long time for his stunt in D.C. God. Politicians love to teabag the rest of us. Too bad they can't take the heat. What your friend did was domestic terrorism in the eyes of the law. Not my friend. His associates, the ones we arrested, identified you as the ringleader of their outfit. Trust me, I am no leader. (LAUGHS) I can barely keep a guy. Look, Darlene. I don't really care what happened in D.C. In fact, I thought it was kind of funny. I've never seen Congress move as fast as they did on that day. But there are serious holes in your story. And I want to work with you to figure out why. Look. Babe. I know how this works. You get close to me, play the sympathy card, relate to me... we're just two crazy, wacky Jersey girls. Take advantage that I did lose what probably was the love of my life. And you act like you care. But that's just it... an act. Which is sick and twisted. I'd rather you arrest me and throw me into jail. But let's get something straight. You will not get anything out of me. So why don't you go read your manual and find the chapter on conniving c**ts that don't give a f*ck about you or your feelings and then get back to me with some real tactics? Otherwise, get me a lawyer. As far as I'm concerned, my only statement to you is that I saw my boyfriend go brainless last night at dinner. I ordered the breakfast combo, and he stole some of my bacon. If you want any other details, the answer is suck a dick. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) Wait here. (BUZZER) (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Remember that movie? I used to love it growing up. It's not really scary, but gory. You know how those two things aren't really the same? This is the stuff we found from Cisco's place. Couldn't find any tapes. Figured you were smart enough to destroy them. We're running fingerprints and DNA. Soon we're gonna figure out if those fsociety videos were filmed using this camera. If we find your DNA on that stuff... I don't know... you tell me how that looks. As far as your fsociety videos are concerned, it looks like the one person that can help you is f*cking dead. As far as I'm concerned, Cisco and I were into filming some freaky sh1t. Is that a matter of national security too, hon? Then there's this. Remember your buddy, Xander Jones? According to him, you guys had a sexual relationship. (SCOFFS) Dude, are you just gonna slut shame me all day? Is that really all you got? He also said that you were the one that stole his gun. Well, I can't prove that, obviously, because your fingerprints weren't on his safe. I figured you'd be crafty enough to clean up afterward. What is funny, though, is that this casing is linked to the Fun Society arcade. (TENSE MUSIC) ♪ ♪ Darlene... You sure you still don't want to talk to me? (TENSE MUSIC) ♪ ♪ 
 
 What do you think? They're planning something. Mr. Robot, Tyrell, Dark Army, and Whiterose are in cahoots to plan something big. And the worst part? They all think it's me. They all think I'm the ringleader, the one in charge, and I have no idea what it is. This place is Mount Olympus. We are prime. We're ready! ♪ ♪ These are blueprints for a building and a disassembled firmware for an uninterruptible power supply, but I can't understand much past that. I'm not sure what the play is. I could ask him, but who am I really asking? Elliot, look over here. (FOREBODING MUSIC) ♪ ♪ Paper docs are coming in from all over, slowly but surely. The blueprints. Is that the building? The offline version? 17 of 71 facilities around the country so far. Within the next month, they'll have all the paper documents here. I thought we were gonna have to deal with multiple facilities, but they're making it easier for us by moving it all to one. This is where the paper records are going. They're trying to rebuild the database. Titles and deeds, the bloodline of all real property in this country. This is how they're surviving the hack. When our malware executes, their whole program... Our malware? What malware? Oh, you orchestrated it beautifully. When the hacked firmware... Designed to override the safety limits on the UPS devices and overcharge the lead acid batteries in the battery room... filling the space up with hydrogen gas. After breaking the fans and cutting off backup power, the malicious firmware repeatedly re-engages the UPS autotransformer, creating a spark to ignite an explosion. There are enough batteries to produce enough hydrogen gas to level the building. When you hacked Evil Corp, you gave us access to the backdoor. You made it possible for us to infect them. I coded the femtocell malware for Darlene. But it wasn't supposed to be for this. The conference call leak, I must admit, was quite cute... a nice distraction. But this... is for us. ♪ ♪ All of us. ♪ ♪ I'm gonna rip his f*ckin' face off! This fucker thinks he can hurt my girl. What's his address? Tell me his address, 'cause I'm gonna go find him, and I'm gonna f*ckin' kill him. (OBJECTS CRASH, SHATTER) Are you done? (OBJECTS CLATTERING) If you're serious about punishing him... I am. I am. Just tell me what to do, and I'll f*ckin' do it. I'll do it. No questions asked. Just... Shh. If you are serious about punishing him, then you can do one thing for me. What? Anything. Say the word. You remember the night we met at the E Corp party? Yeah. You were tending the bar that night. You stayed late to clean up. Yeah, that's what we always do after the... Then you saw Scott coming down from the stairwell leading to the roof. He was disheveled, out of breath, sweaty. You were about to ask him if he needed anything, but he was in such a hurry, he left without saying a word. What are you talking about? I didn't see anything like that. Yes, you did. No. I remember because the cops were asking every one of us questions about that night, and like I told them... cleaned up my station, and I went home. Derek, you said you were serious about punishing him. (LAUGHS) Yeah, but Joanna... Look at my face, Derek. You want the man that did this to me to do what he did and get away with it? But Joanna, I... Once you tell the cops your story, they're gonna ask you why you're just now confessing after months of silence. You're gonna tell them that you were scared... that Scott Knowles intimidated you. That when Tyrell went missing, you didn't think any of that mattered anymore. But your conscience got the better of you. This is how we win. This is how we punish him. You understand? Thank you. Thank you for protecting me. Of course, babe. I love you. Now, let's go over it again. We can't do this. You want us to stay on target? This is the target. This gets us to the top. I know we've been operating under top secret on this program, but I think it's worth the risk. This girl's being a wise-ass. She thinks she's smarter than we are. That's because so far she has been. We got to show her we're smarter. Unless she thinks we're worthy, none of this is gonna fly. Just trying to sidestep the mines, like you said. We've been building this plan for three months. Look around you. All our leads are getting killed and disappearing. We've lost three suspects. Dark Army's cleaning house. So that must mean something is about to go down. Our window is closing. Every lead we've been following up to this point has led to a dead end. Yeah, I'm gonna bring the ADIC in on this. Please, you're gonna let him try and flip her? She's gonna shut down. I'm right for this. Then I'm gonna go in with you. Let me do it alone. I know her. I am her. And if we're doing this, we're doing this now. (BUZZER) We have 6,332 agents working on just this case alone. It's the hardest case I've ever worked on and probably the hardest one I ever will. Swear to God, the only reason why I think I've gotten this far... Is because I have no life. (SMALL LAUGH) It's the only thing I've been able to think about. Now I'm sitting here with you... In this awful room. And no matter what story gets written in the final analysis, we've both been a part of one of the biggest events in world history. Believe what you want. But neither you nor I are special. I've already learned that lesson. If you're open to changing your mind, I'd like to show you something. Come with me. You're a lot more special than you think.
