 I don't have many options. Someone's closing in on us. 
 I have to find out what they know. 
 What exactly are you doing? 
 I'm hacking the FBI. 
 With the FBI at Evil Corp, physical security is madness. 
 It's Angela. She's our only option. 
 Did you talk to the FBI? 
 This is simple. 
 I'll give you a small device which you'll take to work. 
 Drop at the Fed's office on the 23rd floor, and walk away. 
 We have no other options; the president can't go to Congress with a bailout right now. 
 Let me know when you've locked up the votes. 
 What are you up to? 
 You're not doing anything on your end to help. 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, please buy my CD. 
 He got into my system and he wants me to put the CD on one of the computers at work. 
 Well, I guess I should pay up, Ahmed, before I get lynched over here. 
 Let me guess. You're excited. 
 Yeah, I'm excited. 
 We get to go to China. 
 (RAPID GUNFIRE, SCREAMING) 
 Elliot, before you get started, I'm asking you to help me and not look where you don't need to. 
 Are we really back to this again? 
 Ray is not some coffee shop owner. 
 Forget what you saw and move on. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 We're deep down inside you, Elliot. 
 You can't leave us, and we can't leave you.
