 There's a little talent roaming around on this floor, but the primo poon is on floor   .    
 As of last week, it looks like Tyrell was right.   
 Evil Corp has delivered their paper records   from    of their    buildings to their New York facility.

 Factoring in the bureaucracy and the line of   corrupt, moronic managers I have to get through,   I'll need to keep up the illusion that   shipments are still happening.   
 These are the same damn boxes you brought last week.     
 You know me. I do what the paper says.     
 All right!     
 Pack it up, boys!     
 Problem with my illusion is,   what if Tyrell and the Dark Army think all the records actually get there?   
 This is why I gotta keep the UPS systems safe too,   because these innocuous backup batteries   in the New York facility   can turn into idle bombs with the right malware.   
 And these are the frontline soldiers trusted to protect them.   
 You guys gonna stop me? 
Uh, I'm a bloodhound, girl.     
 I just dove right back in, dude, just... ah.     
 This patch ensures that the UPS devices   
 will only run trusted code

 all the paper records got here,   
 they won't be able to blow up that building.

 Tonight, please welcome our special guest, Joanna Wellick. Thanks for being here.     
 Thank you for having me.     
 Scott Knowles has, uh, been facing charges for murdering his wife, Sharon Knowles.     
 Initially, your husband, Tyrell Wellick, was accused of the murder, until you claimed Scott Knowles confessed to killing his wife while beating you.     
 And since then, a bartender from the night of the party has also come forward to corroborate your story.     
 I know that this must be difficult for you.     
 You've been brave just coming here.     
 Do you want to tell us a little more about what happened?     
 My lawyers have advised me not to speak to that.     
 But what I can say, Frank, is that     
 I didn't need Scott Knowles to be arrested to know that my husband is innocent.     
 Mr. Knowles is... clearly a troubled man and has been fixating on us for some time.     
 I understand that you and your son have been tormented endlessly by fanatics and paparazzi.     
 Some even went so far as to claim you filed for divorce.     
 I did file for divorce... a few months ago.     
 It was a moment of weakness.     
 I listened to the wrong people, who were convincing me that that was the right thing to do.
