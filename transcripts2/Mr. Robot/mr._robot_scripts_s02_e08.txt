 What if this all went away? The money, this city, all of it? 
 The world is filled with stupid people,  and I get paid a lot to be smart. 
 Susan Jacobs, the general counsel at E Corp. Madam executioner. [screams] The tracking on her phone is working. How long you think she's gonna stay away for? Long enough. Have you ever considered which part of our scheme motivates you? The FBI announced today Tyrell Wellick and fsociety engaged in this attack. Are you alone? That's called a femtocell. So we can get every FBI email, text message, and document. We just owned the FBI. They have something called Operation Berenstain. Possibly heavy surveillance. [grunting] Ah!

Think iPhones are for pussies. [chuckles] What are you on? iPhone. [softly] Right. You think they suck so much, but they're faster. Uh... [coughing] Bullshit. I mean, if you're talking boot times, then it's Android all day, and if you're talking net speed, Chrome on Android has better HTML5 compliance and runs JavaScript so much faster than Safari. No competition. Oh, yeah? Prove it. Go to this benchmarking website. We'll compare speeds. Okay. Game on. Ugh, are you on the Wi-Fi here? Yes. [sighs] It's slow as sh1t. Agreed. It's hit or miss. There's another Ron's Coffee Shop. Oh, 14th Street. Yeah, I know. Everyone always Reddits about that one. Crazy fast. You can practically stream 4K videos on your laptop. Why aren't you there now, then? You got me. iPhones suck. [clears throat] I'm, uh, meeting someone. What about you? Same. Cool, cool, cool. Oh, the old malicious browser benchmark trick. I see you already own this newb's whole system. I like it. Didn't your mom ever tell you not to surf websites that have an embedded Stagefright exploit? Can't drop the proverbial soap around a black-hat bitch like this, Mobley. Darlene, I... I thought I was meeting Elliot. Me too. Relax, kids, this isn't the stranger danger episode.

Everyone on? It's Kirby, Megan, and Zach from the seventh floor. Yup, all here. Great. Don't have a ton of time. It is the nation's birthday, after all, so let's get down to brass tacks. ♪ ♪ E Corp, Google, AT&T, Uber, Apple, Verizon, Facebook... all 23 of these listed companies have been complicit in aiding the FBI in Operation Berenstain. [tape crackling] Jesus, what is that noise? Okay, tape's busted. Just grab another one and we'll do it again. Yeah. [soft dramatic music] Okay. f*ck it. I'll keep it simple. [clears throat] Happy Fourth of July, fellow Americans. On this patriotic holiday, we wanted to remind you, under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, privacy is a right. Or at least it used to be. Listen closely to a classified conference call we recently intercepted  between the FBI agents that so earnestly promise you fidelity, bravery, and integrity. Come on, Kirby, screw the 3 million. They got us the 17 we're building our case around now. Doesn't help that Comey hasn't signed off on it. The fact that we're keeping it from him does not bode well for your case. He's an uptight choirboy. No one's gonna be crying over how we catch these terrorists. I guarantee that. The FBI has 3 million of you innocent citizens under surveillance for no reason. Their tyrannical rape of our private data ends now. FBI, be warned. Your access to our lives is officially denied. Pursue us at your own peril. We do not compromise. We will not back down. We will destroy you. We are... fsociety. [sustained beep] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [faintly] Smartphone out there... It's never going to be... Come on, Kirby, screw the 3 million... Video's up. [keyboard keys clicking] 16 in the code name case. Right, 16. One's deceased. It doesn't help that Comey hasn't signed off on it. Stop listening to that. It's making you more paranoid. What about this, um, code name case thing? They said they have 16 suspects under surveillance. Video's getting hits. It's starting to get reposted. They said one of the suspects is dead. They gotta be talking about Romero, right? We have to be on that list. I uploaded the full Berenstain call and transcript to WikiLeaks. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, slow your roll, bro. No one's going anywhere. We gotta monitor the fallout of the video before anyone makes a move. Exposing their program is gonna shut down the investigation. I don't care anymore. I'm officially done. You don't wanna do this. You mean the, uh... the Dark Army doesn't want me to do this, bro? No, no, no, no, I mean you. 'Cause when the Dark Army finds out the FBI nails you, which they will... Mm. It's lights out.

Congrats on everything. Still, though, that's gotta be tough on your father, though. Having to watch while you bow down to those bastards that killed your mother. [scoffs] That can't be an easy pill for him to swallow. [chuckles] For you, though, swallowing's not really a problem, now, is it? [chuckles] Just, uh, who the hell do you think you are, anyway? ♪ ♪ [cheers and applause] You're a plumber. Right, Steve? You've had, what, 60 years at life? That's the best you can come up with? Literally cleaning sh1t for a living? I'm 27, and I've got a six-figure salary at the biggest conglomerate in history, and I'm just getting started. That's who I am. Don't do this! [zip ties rustling] Now you're only at class B felony kidnapping charges. Don't bump it up to class A. Shut the f*ck up! [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] You have no idea the sh1t you're in. ♪ ♪ One of us should have been watching the GPS. This is some next-level sh1t, man. Okay, we didn't have a choice. We couldn't let her go to the cops. Yeah, well, she can ID all of us now. She saw everything, our whole setup. She knows who we are. Help! Hello? I know you can see me! God damn it. Trenton, go shut her up. Go! f*ck it. I say we take our chances out there. Let her go. Take off. Go our separate ways. Yeah, right. Then there'll be a manhunt with our faces on it. Yeah, if there isn't one already. Hello! [door opens] ♪ ♪ I need the bathroom. Not yet. I kinda can't control it. Let me check downstairs first. I really need to go. It'll only take a second. ♪ ♪ You guys don't know what the hell you're doing, do you? You're Muslim? Is that what all this is about? ISIS or something? You're all a bunch of goddamn animals.

Go ahead, okay? Go right ahead. All of you can't accept the fact that maybe we f*cked up. Okay? Take a look at the city. It's going to sh1t, man. Now, first it'll be blackouts. Then it'll be the National Guard. Either we go now or... Jesus! [footsteps approaching] Keep it together! Um... Darlene. This isn't exactly what I meant by "shut her up." Okay, well... maybe our problem solved itself. Oh, so, what, we just let her die? We need to get her to a hospital. No. No, not until we're sure she won't talk. Tie her up. That's a nasty head wound.

No, I agree with Mr. Jones here. I've been scratching my head on this one, but evidence is evidence, and holiday or not, I had to follow up on this. Found this incriminating little guy at a critical location tied to the Five/Nine hack. The shell's microstamp leads right to your client's gun. The gun that he had in the city of New York illegally, I might add. [whispering inaudibly] Immunity is on the table in exchange for a name. That's all I care about. Let's keep this friendly. [gasps] [exhales deeply] [sighs] I need a doctor. Yeah, it's pretty bad. Nice place you got. Comfy. Is your place in Greenwich this cush? I worked hard for what I have. You know, I'm glad you came home, but my friends are freaking out. Came up with this neat little plan to blackmail you for your silence. Hacked your emails. We got some good stuff too. Nice little Petraeus email scam you got going on there. You shouldn't get hot and heavy with your presiding judges, Suze. I'm sure you're aware that's illegal, but... I know you don't care about things like that. You'd slime your way around it and f*ck us over just like you did my dad. Who's dead, by the way. But you... You aged very well. The first time I saw you, I was four. Still remember it. On the news in the courtroom when they cleared E Corp of all the bullshit they put my family through. And you were in the back behind a sea of suits, and you laughed. It was so quick, no one even noticed. No one but me. Four-year-old little me. So... I'm happy I get to look you in the eye. I have taken down your company, taken over your home, and now... I have you. Okay. [exhales] So you got me. [exhales] Where do we go from here? I'm sure we can figure something out.

Has to be self-defense. What's the plan? We can't stay here. Who knows who's gonna be waiting for you at home? Dark Army, FBI, cops. I can't leave my family. If you had that much to lose, you shouldn't have done this in the first place. But I did this for them. What we did was colossally f*cking stupid, and we can't afford not to realize that anymore. Peace, Trent. Yeah, I'm on my way. [subway door chimes] ♪ ♪ All right, my vote, we leave it here, wipe our prints, and just make a run for it. We can't. The others'll be back soon. They'll find her. Why don't I just... just text them and tell them the place is burned? Can't take the risk they won't listen and come back anyway. We need to get rid of it. [scoffs] We ain't doing sh1t. I'll see if my guys can take care of it. Okay, no offense, but I don't trust them either. [sighs] This is my responsibility. [scoffs] Well, if this is the part of the conversation where you start throwing out ideas like acid and wood chippers, I ain't obliging. This isn't a conversation.

Pull out your phone. What the f*ck is in there? I'm paying you enough for privacy. [cell phone buzzes] It's done. All yours. [sighs] Susan donated them from her cold storage. It's not as if she can use them anymore. She can pay for her own funeral. [straining] No... [grunts] Oh, no, easy, easy, wait. [grunts] Just move it... [grunts] God. [both breathing heavily] Rug's too big. No sh1t. We need to take her out. [exhales] This is some traumatizing sh1t. You know that?

[chuckles] Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna talk, and all you have to do is listen. Because, believe it or not, Mr. Markesh, you could be real instrumental in helping to solve this Five/Nine case. [scoffs] Leslie Romero. Forgive me, hon, you do know your friend was found murdered? My heart goes out to you. It's very unfortunate. I went over to his mother's after everything went down. I wanted to offer my condolences, and I took a quick look around while I was over there. That's when I found this. An end of the world party featuring DJ Mobley. I'm not an EDM fan myself, but a quick search on the wayback machine, and guess what we found all the way from 2003. You. An Angelfire page that you created from back in the day. Your very own DJ Mobley fan page. In fact, curiously enough, you were the only one that ever created a fan page of this guy. Must have really spoken to you. [chuckles softly] Trust me, I feel the same way about "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion." But like you, I found myself very much in the minority. So a big fan. Obscure DJ with a unique name. Seems like the perfect recipe for how a hacker handle gets born. Here's the deal: we want Tyrell Wellick, not Tyrell Wellick's DJ. Your friend is dead, and that's a sad thing, but at this point, the best thing that could happen would be if there's something you can tell me... names, people, any information at all that you can give us from that party that would help. Lawyer. I want a lawyer. Do you have any evidence on this guy? This is not the strategy we have implemented. Top down, not bottom up. We needed to get some traction. This is a way. He's a minor player that won't blow our strategy. He'll start flushing some of these guys out. Are you not watching the news? We are in a world of sh1t because of this leaked conference call. The OPR is going to be coming down on us any day. It's all over the Senate Intelligence Hearings. The deputy director, assistant director of Cyber Division and the EAD are all getting fired. Comey's about to announce that Operation Berenstain is dead, and you just held this guy for 12 hours for no reason. You have to think about how this looks, Dom. [sighs] Whatever paranoia you've put into him is done, just by picking him up. Let him go. [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I'll be back later. ♪ ♪ [indistinct speech on TV] I lost her. I don't know what I did wrong. I thought she was into me. Don't let it get you in the dumps. Getting into the mind of a woman, it's the toughest route for even the best sources. I can't get into it right now. This fsociety video's blowing up in our face. That's some fucked-up sh1t you guys did. It's got me all paranoid. How do I know you guys aren't watching me too? We look like fools. sh1t's worse than Snowden. Privacy rights activist Edward Snowden. [sighs] When you say I don't care about the right to privacy... Speak of the devil. Because I have nothing to hide, that's no different than saying I don't care about freedom of speech because I have nothing to say. Despite the cybersecurity breach in obtaining the information on Operation Berenstain, the controversy over privacy rights has prompted calls for greater government transparency. Advocates are demanding... Look, I'm done with this. You know, she's stone cold anyway, Dom. I'm not gonna lie... I kinda got hurt. She never talked about fsociety or her old friends from back in the day? She hasn't given up anything since you first put me on her, and she bailed on me for some old dude at the bar. A contact? I think she's just into old dudes. Paying employees only a portion of their wages. In a statement, UWUA leaders claimed... [shower running] Cisco? Cisco? Yo, what's up?
