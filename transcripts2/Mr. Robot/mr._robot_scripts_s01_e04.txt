 Steel Mountain. The hacker's dilemma. 
 What to do when a bunch of DATA you want to destroy is completely off the grid? 
 Hello, Evil Corp. We are FSociety. 
 Man of the hour. Take a curtsy. 
 Dark Army? 
 They got no code. They hack for anyone: Terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia... 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped. 
 Please buy my CD. 
 He has my bank account, Ollie. 
 We cannot just infect Allsafe's network because of this. 
 Darlene : Can we please hear the plan? 
 Where are we at with Steel Mountain? 
 I know how to take out the backups without blowing up the pipeline. 
 What do normal people do when they get this sad? 
 They reach out to friends or family. 
 I do morphine. 
 Elliot : There it is. 
 After all the searching, scraping, dusting, that's all that's left. 
 One line. The last line. 
 The consequences of busting Vera and meeting Mr. Robot, creating you... everything till now, this moment. 
 I chose this. I chose all this. 
 Data storage facilities like Steel Mountain... it's linear-tape open standard 9. 
 Temp value between 61 and 95. 
 Iron oxide in mag tape... it sticks to polyurethane with a binder. 
 If HVAC conditions surpass the ceiling 95 degrees, polyurethane adhesive mollifies and tape DATA is unreadable. 
 [upbeat suspenseful music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [sizzling] 
 This is what we're doing. 
 This circuit board, if installed behind a thermostat, it lets us plant an asymmetric back door then create a VPN in the Steel Mountain intranet. 
 Okay, we all know what a raspberry pie is. 
 What's your point? 
 He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system, raise the facility's heat high enough to destroy all the tapes. 
 And you think sticking this behind the thermostat will do all that? 
 With the right software specifically designed. 
 I'll pull up my research on the facility, start targeting which thermostats are the most accessible. 
 Yeah, well, that's all well and good, but we still gotta get in the damn joint. 
 Romero : There. Deep in the Adirondacks. 
 In 145-plus acre former limestone mine. 
 3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards, closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing. 
 Sure you don't want to just blow it up? 
 [scoffs] 
 [Romero exhales] 
 All we need is one security flaw. 
 Look at this place, man. It was built not to have any. 
 I see about... six walking around. 
 [coughs] 
 You okay, man? 
 [coughing] 
 Romero : What the hell? 
 Where you going? 
 We're done, aren't we? 
 Elliot, voice-over : That was about the time the withdrawal started. 
 Remember? 
 I know... I broke my own rule. 
 But I have no Suboxone. 
 What I do have... clinical depression, social anxiety. 
 A day job, a night job, confusing relationships. 
 Others depending on me. 
 Taking down the largest corporation in the world. 
 And I chose it all. 
 This line has wanted to own me my whole life. 
 Biosynthesized in some lab in Mexico, packed into a pill, shipped to the States where it was packaged with a logo and taxed by the government, stolen by a bribed guard, sold to a Vera henchman, oversold to Shayla, and then to me. 
 It needs me just as much as I need it. 
 The moment was destined, every choice bringing me closer to this one line. 
 This line. This last line. 
 I promise. 
 Today will be the worst of it. 
 Get through the next couple days, and then I'll be clean. 
 [shouts] What do you want? 
 Huh? 
 [knock on door] 
 [pounding on door] 
 I would have saved you the trip to the door but you're all, like, against me breaking in or whatever. 
 Why are you here? 
 Romero got some clarity on your little plan that's gonna need your undivided. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 What's going on with you? 
 You look like sh1t. 
 I'm fine. 
 [low chatter] 
 Look, man. This plan's not gonna work. 
 Why? Why is that? 
 I was doing recon on Steel Mountain. 
 Came up with a problem. A big, fat one. 
 Evil Corp's upping their security protocol. 
 If you ask me, it's overkill, but it's legit. 
 I already told you, they have their vulnerabilities. 
 So what happens after we hack the New York facility? 
 Then we have to take a trip to Nashville, then Colorado, then San Jose, then goddamn Tallahassee. 
 Ugh, this looks real bad. Real bad. 
 They are physically copying then shipping all the analog backups. 
 Five big-ass fortress-like redundancies across the country. 
 Now maybe... and it was always a big maybe... we get into one, but no way we get into all of them. 
 The minute we fry one facility, they'll patch every climate control system they own. 
 No matter how you slice it, the plan is DOA. 
 Where'd you get this? 
 What the hell do you mean? 
 We're still in Evil Corp's network. 
 [softly] sh1t. 
 This is what Tyrell was talking about. 
 What'd you just say? Tyrell? 
 As in Tyrell Wellick? 
 Yeah. 
 Since when did you and the goddamn CTO of Evil Corp become, what, chums? 
 Says this isn't happening till April 1st. 
 It's only the 29th. 
 We still got a few days. 
 We have time. 
 All their tapes are still inhe New York facility. 
 Just means we go up today. 
 We're nowhere close to being ready. 
 Well, I've already downloaded all the necessary PDFs of the floor plans to target the thermostats. 
 It will require some planning, but nothing I can't do in the car. 
 It shouldn't take me long to own the facility's SCADA network. 
 Especially with some help. 
 You guys hit the road while Trenton helps  me   finish the distro. 
 We'll double-time it. 
 You can get it off the FTP server as soon as you get there. 
 What about China? 
 We'd have to execute the hack before Tuesday. 
 Don't worry about China. 
 I'll it up my Dark Army contact as soon as you take off. 
 Oh, you just gonna hit up the world's most dangerous hacker crew? 
 Pssh, ya'll have gone and misplaced your collective minds. 
 We've been planning this for months. 
 Now we're gonna go up on a lark just 'cause he said so? 
 This plan is sh1t. 
 Elliot : The plan will work. 
 And once we're actually there, I still need to prep the social engineering, plus we have no idea who physically's gonna go in. 
 It's my plan. I'll go in. 
 Look, man, you... you might be able to hide it from these nerds, but I know a junkie when I see one. 
 In your condition, you ain't gonna do Jack or Jill except puke your brains out or give hand jobs for another high. 
 Like you said, in three days, one Steel Mountain becomes five. 
 That's no good for any plan. 
 Something ain't right about this guy. 
 Yeah, well. He's gotten us this far. 
 Still, I don't trust him. 
 Well, it's not about trust, remember? 
 [car alarm activates] 
 [device beeps] 
 Thank you, Mom. 
 There it is. 
 All right. 
 Come to Daddy.

 ♪ ♪ 
 [engine revs] (Romero) Yeah. Ha ha ha. 
 Yo, man. 
 You gonna say anything about this? 
 What's there to say? 
 You seem to have everything under control. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 This isn't my operation. 
 [laughs] 
 [coughing] 
 I told you before. 
 You're the key to the whole thing. 
 You're the only force of nature at play here. 
 Elliot, voice-over : There's a saying. 
 The devil's at his strongest while we're looking the other way, like a program running in the background silently, while we're busy doing other sh1t. 
 Daemons, they call them. 
 They perform action without user interaction. 
 Monitoring, logging, notifications. 
 Primal urges, repressed memories, unconscious habits. 
 They're always there, always active. 
 We can try to be right, we can try to be good. 
 We can try to make a difference, but it's all bullshit. 
 'Cause intentions are irrelevant. 
 They don't drive us. Daemons do. 
 And me? I've got more than most. 
 [retches] 
 Elliot : I just need to rest a minute, okay? I'll be fine. 
 Romero : Bullshit... a couple hours, you'll wish you felt as shitty as you do right now. 
 Wait till the convulsions start. 
 Full body pains, leaking from everywhere, then... 
 Elliot, voice-over : Hypersensitivity to brightness and sound. 
 After that, overwhelming paranoia followed by the darkest of depressions. 
 Symptoms may persist for two weeks, assuming I last that long. 
 Yeah, I know what's in store. 
 Romero may have a point. 
 You're not gonna be good for anything till you kick this. 
 I... it burns. 
 [shaky breathing] 
 Elliot, voice-over : Don't be mad at me. 
 I know I slipped, but I'm about to change the world. 
 I'm allowed a few mistakes. I'm about to change the world. 
 [soft thud] 
 [whispers] sh1t. 
 [inhales] 
 Mm, that is the way I like to get up in the morning. 
 Screw coffee or breakfast in bed. 
 The first thing I could see every day is that sweet butt of yours. 
 I'd be the happiest dude in the city. 
 Are you going somewhere, babe? 
 Yeah, um, I'm gonna meet my dad for brunch. 
 What? No, babe. 
 I was gonna take you to brunch. 
 I mean, I know that things are, like, okay between us right now, but I'm... I'm not gonna let myself off easy, all right? 
 You will be wined, and you will be dined until I feel I've gotten myself out of the doghouse. 
 Well, we can do something tonight, then. 
 Perfect. 
 Okay. 
 No. 
 [knock at door] 
 Oh, hey. 
 Is Elliot around? I tried texting him. 
 Uh, he didn't text me back. 
 Yeah, he's gone for the day, which is why I'm on Flipper duty. 
 Where is he? 
 sh1t if I know. 
 I mean, I don't ask details, but he only ever tells me what he wants anyway, right? 
 And I'll tell him you stopped by. 
 Do you want to walk with us? 
 Flipper loves an audience when she pees. 
 Sure. Yeah. I gotta... head back towards the subway anyway. 
 Oh, we don't plan our path. 
 I mean, we just kind of wing it and see where the moment takes us. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, before she bursts. 
 Elliot, voice-over : Maybe this was all intentional. 
 My subconscious, running in the background, making me doubt what I got everyone else to believe in. 
 Turning me into the physical manifestation of my fear of being a... 
 Goddamn waste. 
 Just give him a night to recover, okay? 
 We still have tomorrow. 
 This sh1t'll last a week. 
 And I refuse to waste my time playing nurse. 
 We gotta get back, regroup, start devising a plan B. 
 [electronic stuttering] 
 man : The rabbit is in the administration system. 
 Send a flu shot. 
 Rabbit, flu shot... 
 Someone talk to me. 
 A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer. 
 Cancer? 
 Hollywood hacker bullshit. 
 I been in this game 27 years. 
 Not once have I ever come across an animated singing virus. 
 I have yet to fly through a Tron City directory structure. 
 I bet you right now some writer's working hard on a TV show that'll mess up this generation's idea of hacker culture.

 Jesus, it's been a full 24 hours. 
 Where the hell could they be? 
 Got any Advil? 
 [pills rattling] 
 I'm guessing you didn't make contact. 
 Nope. 
 Perhaps this plan was a little too ambitious. 
 We'll wait until the rest of them get back and then reevaluate. 
 Sitting here helpless while we crash and burn? 
 Not my speed. 
 Even if they hack into Steel Mountain, we need to hit China's DATA centers simultaneously. 
 If the Dark Army isn't compliant, then there's not much we can do. 
 [laughs] God... sh1t! 
 I got so wasted, I forgot it's Sunday. 
 I know where my guy will be. 
 Trenton : Is that wise? 
 Those guys aren't known for being the most understanding. 
 I'm assuming if he wanted contact... 
 What about what I want? 
 [rustling in purse] 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No, thank you. 
 You stick around, wait for the boys to FTP it. 
 Hey, Trenton. 
 Here. 
 What is this? 
 Come on, they're my last two. 
 Is this ecstasy? 
 No, it's clarity. 
 It'll help you see past whatever's bringing you down. 
 I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude. 
 I... don't do drugs. 
 I mean, I-I smoke weed... 
 Well, sorry, but there's no take-backs, so... 
 Besides, don't you want to figure your sh1t out?
