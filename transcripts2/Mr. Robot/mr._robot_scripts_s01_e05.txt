 Mobley : He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system, raise the facility's heat high enough to destroy all the tapes. 
 This is what we're doing. 
 I'll hit up my Dark Army contact as soon as you take off. 
 Romero : You just gonna hit up the world's most dangerous hacker crew? 
 He has my bank account, Ollie. 
 We cannot just infect Allsafe's network because of this. I'll lose my job. 
 Evil Corp's upping their security protocol. 
 They are physically copying, then shipping all the analog backups. 
 We go up today. 
 [speaking Swedish] 
 I want you to be where you belong, here with me. 
 I think I'm happy where I am. 
 Shayla : Don't let me down, okay? 
 That girl in there is mine. 
 Shayla : Did you have something to do with Vera getting busted? 
 He's on murder charges. Do you know that? 
 It's my plan. I'll go in. 
 You might be able to hide it from these nerds, but I know a junkie when I see one. 
 [sniffles] I'm alone. 
 No, you're not. 
 I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

 Carol : I wish I had better news for you, Fernando, but this isn't the you're-getting-out meeting. 
 This is only as much as I could carry. 
 The D.A. has more. 
 How long this gonna be? 
 We're talking years. 
 Yo, you playing? 
 You get our people out. 
 That's your use to us. 
 They have a solid case. 
 For every charge they're gonna lay on you, they have these binders, your Twitters, your Instagram. 
 You said they wouldn't figure this sh1t out. 
 Manny : They can't, brah. 
 I'm telling you, it was airtight, V. 
 Fellas, this isn't the imitation game. 
 The code here is not that complicated. 
 Besides, who told you to put your business anywhere near social media? 
 My aspirational little brother. 
 You know how much money we saved last year? 
 Made our whole operation way more efficient. 
 We were careful. 
 You tweeted about every transaction your business was involved in. 
 That is the opposite of careful. 
 It's no wonder an anonymous tip turned you in. 
 Who called in the tip? 
 This is what is meant by anonymous. 
 It is now spilled milk. 
 The information got out, and now they're coming down hard. 
 There's no plea on the table. 
 They're gonna lay murder one on you. 
 I ain't pleading anyway. 
 Men can't sentence me. 
 That is a cosmic responsibility. 
 Someone's gonna get hurt for this. 
 That's how we get square with the universe. 
 Fernando, we need to discuss strategy. 
 You don't want Supermax. 
 Naw, naw. 
 If they lock me up, the kind of door they close don't matter.

 Elliot : Steel Mountain. 
 We're trying to penetrate a data security facility whose tagline literally is... 
 Nothing is actually impenetrable. 
 A place like this says it is, and it's close, but people still built this place. 
 And if you can hack the right person, all of a sudden, you have a piece of powerful malware. 
 People always make the best exploits. 
 I've never found it hard to hack most people. 
 If you listen to them, watch them, their vulnerabilities are like a neon sign screwed into their heads. 
 Mobley's a glutton. 
 He lacks discipline from his urges. 
 I don't want to get bugs. They spread disease. 
 Elliot : Romero is a know-it-all and a hypochondriac. 
 Mobley : Bill Harper is our first exploit. 
 He isn't gonna give the search much scrutiny. 
 He'll get us to Level 1, but Bill is not gonna be able to get us to Level 2. 
 And we need to get to Level 2. 
 You're gonna ask to speak to his supervisor, Wendy. 
 She'll get us to exactly where we need to be. 
 Then we'll be able to get rid of her from the van. 
 After that, you connect the Raspberry Pi to the climate control system, and Bob's your uncle. 
 Now we can hear you, and you can hear us. 
 Elliot : Mr. Robot? 
 His flaw is he's absolutely insane. 
 We're talking clinical. 
 When they say, "If your friends jump off a bridge, would you?" he would, without hesitation, just to prove something. 
 He goes in there, he's liable to blow the whole place up, just like he wanted to in the first place. 
 Sure you don't want to look over the info and the map again? 
 I got it. 
 Okay, James Bond, let's go mess their sh1t up. 
 Boom, boom. 
 Elliot : Yes, I also have security flaws. 
 I don't like being outside. 
 I liked morphine too much. 
 Mr. Sepiol? 
 Elliot : I'm talking to you right now, and you don't exist. 
 Sam Sepiol? 
 Sir? 
 That's you, Elliot. 
 Okay. 
 So sorry you had to wait. 
 As you can see, there's always a lot of bustle here. 
 How can I help you today? 
 Mr. Robot : You need a tour. Don't elaborate. 
 Um... a tour. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sure they told you at reception that we... we require appointments for tours. 
 My supervisor gives us all a hard time about that. 
 I'm Sam Sepiol. 
 You should look me up. 
 Okay. [clears throat] 
 A little inelegant, but we can work with it. 
 Tell you what. 
 Have your company call over to new accounts, and we can set something up later this week. 
 Ask for Bill Harper. 
 They'll know where to find me. [chuckles] 
 Mr. Robot : Listen, Bill. 
 You think your boss gives you a hard time now? 
 You're gonna get a really hard time right after I walk out of here. 
 I'm not rescheduling, Bill. 
 When I walk out that door, I'm never coming back. 
 That's your ass, Bill. 
 I really think you should look me up. 
 It... it just doesn't work like that. 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 You take care, okay? 
 I'm coming out. It's not working. 
 Mr. Robot : It's gonna work. 
 Hang in there. 
 I was being too weird. 
 Mr. Robot : Just like every other tech billionaire. 
 Slow your roll. It's gonna happen. 
 Elliot : It's no wonder Wikipedia is never accurate. 
 Anyone can edit them. 
 Well, not anyone. 
 Nerds like Mobley built a lot of credit over the years with his 20,000 edits. 
 And still people trust it, beholden to all the Mobleys of the world for their information. 
 Mr. Sepiol? 
 Mr. Sepiol! 
 I have some good news. 
 [chuckles] 
 Ollie : Stop it. Stop it. 
 Can you stop packing for, like, five minutes? 
 Can we just hash this out like adults? 
 I love you. 
 You don't even know why you're crying. 
 Let's get married. 
 Ollie, will you please stop? 
 Angela... Angela, you can't just give up on us like this. 
 [scoffs] 
 I mean, have you even thought this through? 
 What are you gonna do, go live with your dad in Jersey? 
 Come on. 
 You're ruining your life. 
 Maybe, but I also ruined yours. 
 Why do you have my work ID? 
 Did you... did you... do you... do you... do you know what's gonna happen? 
 There will be fallout from this, and I'm gonna tell them... 
 I used your computer, so tell them whatever you want. 
 Are you serious? 
 Did you even think about how this would affect me? 
 I did. 
 Bill : Here's an idea of how big this place is. 
 We have our own fire department, inside the building, just for us. 
 And you can't have a fire department without a fire truck, and you can't have a fire truck without roads. 
 We have all of that, inside. 
 Imagine that. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Mr. Robot : Elliot, now's the time we get rid of Bill. 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 There's so much information... 
 Mr. Robot : Okay, we're gonna need to roll up our sleeves here. 
 You have to destroy Bill in order to get to a supervisor. 
 There's one vault in here that's 200,000 square feet. 
 That's the size of a shopping mall, and that's just one. 
 Bill, where are those giant vaults? 
 Oh, they're on Level 2, but that's not part of the tour. 
 Even I don't have authorization. 
 Mr. Robot : He's not gonna take you for ice cream. 
 He has to go away. 
 There's no place in this plan for Bill. 
 Now, right down here... 
 Everything okay, sir? 
 Mr. Robot : We need to tear Bill down piece by piece. 
 You need to wipe that smile off of his stupid face. 
 Sir, are you okay? 
 You're not... you're not saying anything. 
 Mr. Robot : Dig into him, Elliot. 
 You of all people can do this, Elliot. 
 You know how it feels when someone makes you small. 
 You understand what happens when someone exposes the thing you fear most about yourself. 
 Elliot's mother : Answer me! 
 Answer me! 
 [Elliot grunts] 
 Get up. 
 Just get up! 
 I hate you. 
 You're nothing. 
 You're worthless. 
 Think about it, Bill. 
 Think about what? 
 If you died, would anyone care? 
 Would they really care? 
 Yeah, maybe they'd cry for a day, but let's be honest. 
 No one would give a sh1t. 
 They wouldn't. 
 The few people that would feel obligated to go to your funeral would probably be annoyed and leave as early as possible.

 That's what you are. 
 You're nothing to anyone, to everyone.

 So instead of wasting any more of my time, I need you to go call someone that matters, because, Bill... 
 You don't. 
 I'll... [sniffles] I'll call my supervisor. 
 Elliot : And that's why Bill Harper is a perfect exploit, desperate enough for the business to break protocol and let me in. 
 Lonely enough to break. 
 I need a supervisor in L1S3. 
 man : Copy that. 
 [elevator bell dings] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Mr. Robot : Don't apologize. 
 You're almost there. You did great. 
 Romero : Once Wendy gets there, we'll send her a text letting her know her pregnant wife is in labor. 
 Once she leaves, that should give you enough time to plant the Pi, you dig?

 Trudy Davis, Accounts Supervisor. 
 Is there a problem here? 
 Mr. Sepiol is asking... 
 Trudy? 
 What the f*ck? for someone more senior than me. 
 I don't seem to have your name. 
 I'm Sam Sepiol? 
 Is that a question? 
 Trudy? Trudy? 
 Mobley : Where's Wendy? 
 We only prepped for Wendy. Where the hell is Wendy? 
 I need Wendy, actually. 
 And how do you know Wendy? She didn't come in today. 
 Trudy : What is it that you need, Mr. Sepiol? 
 Um... 
 I would love a tour of Level 2. 
 I don't know what you've been told, but we don't allow that. 
 I'll see you out. You can go, Bill. 
 Follow me to the lobby. 
 Romero : This woman's a ghost. 
 None of these are her. 
 No Facebook, no LinkedIn. 
 She's been married for 30 years. 
 All we have is her husband's cell phone number. 
 He doesn't even have a picture online. 
 No hobbies, no kids, no credit problems, no weird s*x stuff. 
 House paid off.

 [quietly] The elevator's almost here. 
 Yes, that's how they work when you press the button. 
 Okay. 
 People... people are all just people, right? 
 When it gets down to it, everyone's the same. 
 They love something. 
 They want something. They fear something. 
 Specifics help, but specifics don't change the way that everyone is vulnerable. 
 It just changes the way that we access those vulnerabilities.

 It's a palm print scanner. 
 Mr. Robot : Get out of there.

 But we were so close. 
 It's not over. 
 We'll rework it. 
 We'll figure something out. 
 We got this far. 
 We'll find a way, just not tonight.

 Elliot : My father picked me up from school one day, and we played hooky and went to the beach. 
 It was too cold to go in the water, so we sat on a blanket and ate pizza. 
 When I got home, my sneakers were full of sand, and I dumped it on my bedroom floor. 
 I didn't know the difference. 
 I was six. 
 My mother screamed at me for the mess, but he wasn't mad. 
 He said that billions of years ago, the world shifting and the oceans moving brought that sand to that spot on the beach, and then I took it away. 
 "Every day," he said, "we change the world," which is a nice thought until I think about how many days and lifetimes I would need to bring a shoe full of sand home until there is no beach, until it made a difference to anyone. 
 Every day, we change the world, but to change the world in a way that means anything, that takes more time than most people have. 
 It never happens all at once. 
 It's slow. 
 It's methodical. 
 It's exhausting. 
 We don't all have the stomach for it.

 Sometimes the universe aligns perfectly. 
 Here I am, locked away. 
 Still, it brings you right to me.
