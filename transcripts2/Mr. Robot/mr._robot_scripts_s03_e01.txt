 There's a reason we met. 
 There's something between us. 
 I can see it. 
 You're only seeing what's in front of you. 
 You're not seeing what's above you. 
 (THUNDER RUMBLING) 
 This is going to be affecting our economy   in ways that are extraordinarily significant.   The FBI announced today   that Tyrell Wellick and fsociety   engaged in this attack.   Blackouts. 
 Why? So they can take away your power. The public is hoarding cash. The housing market is grinding to a halt. Dark Army. They got no code. They hack for anyone. Tell me about your father. We were close. One of the best computer engineers they had. One day, he told me he had leukemia. They are going to try and get rid of me again,  and I need you to not let them. He is a part of you that makes you you.   Who are you talking to?  employees died   in the widely-publicized   Washington Township toxic waste scandal.   If I told you  that your mother and Elliot's father  died for a reason, would it make a difference? That they were sacrificed for the greater good,   that they gave their lives to take humanity to the next level?   Tyrell, are you there? They told me  you would be calling. This is a secure line. You sure you still don't want to talk to me? We got to show her we're smarter. They're going to try and flip her.   Let me do it alone. I know her. This gets his phone mic live.   - I'm going to ask him about Stage .   The Dark Army set this up?   They're our partners.   It's Elliot. He's the one with the plan Femtocell the backdoor.   You planned all of that with him?   You're not hacking anything.   This will level that building and kill people.   I'm going to get rid of the backdoor. We're supposed to be gods together,  and yet you want to destroy our destiny? Step away from the computer! You touch that keyboard, and I will shoot you. No, you won't. You can't. It doesn't exist. This control you think you have... (TENSE MUSIC)   It's an illusion. I'm the only one that exists. It's time to finally take back control. Real control.   "So much depends on a red wheelbarrow."

Yes, and you can redeem it on your next visit. What's the difference? I'm here now. I'm sorry, sir. That's not the way it works. Okay, should I just get out of line  and then get back in? No, sir. You would have to redeem it  on your next visit here. Okay. What qualifies as a visit? Do I have to leave the premises and come back? Do I have to go home? Is it time-based?

(TABLET COVER SNAPS SHUT) Have I ever told you  that Mr. Alderson's father  used to work for us on this project? Unbeknownst to him,  of course. In fact, it was his great engineering work  that led to some of our early successes. What an extraordinary coincidence. And now his son works for us  after so many years. But you don't believe in coincidence. Yes, I don't,  which is why you misunderstand  Mr. Alderson's value. It was his  impassioned plea to destroy E Corp  that presented us with the opportunity  to set our plan in motion, and it has taken  his relentless determination since  to continue it. We may possess the necessary tools,  but what we do not have  is his unadulterated focused... rage. Time presented us Mr. Alderson when we needed him. Therefore,  his will must be our guide. And after Mr. Alderson completes the great work  that we need from him,  then he can die for us. Just like his father.

Who knows what could come from this? Thank you, thank you very much. What if instead of fighting back, we caved,   gave away our privacy for security,   exchanged dignity for safety,   and traded revolution for repression?   What if we choose weakness over strength?
