 Ay is a trusted and loyal advisor, as he was to my father. 
 Ka : But to what end? 
 The priests still take advantage of your people. 
 The Mitanni steal food and crops from our borderlands.

 We must have a child if we're going to survive, sister. 
 Perhaps your mind is with someone else. 
 Use discretion, My Queen. He sees more than you know. 
 I serve only the greater good of Egypt. 
 No, General, you serve me. 
 You're not ready to lead these men into battle. 
 [all shouting] 
 The Pharaoh is dead. 
 When we ride into Thebes, the glory will be yours. 
 Why weren't you by his side to protect him? 
 I was, but battles are not fought without chaos. 
 [grunting] 
 Horemheb : When I returned to where he had fallen, the body was gone. 
 Tut : I cannot be found. 
 Why do they want you dead? 
 You're just a soldier. 
 It's you. 
 Horemheb : There's talk of an illness. 
 People are sick and dying with no cure. 
 The next army to advance will be ours. 
 We will have opportunity again to make our own history and defy their history and claim for ourselves what others believe to be rightfully theirs.

 Do not count them as those who serve you. 
 They served only their ambition. 
 Ka was obviously taken with the promises of General Horemheb and his own desire, which was no secret to anyone.

 The quarantine cannot contain them anymore. 
 Some have escaped. 
 No telling how many more they infected before they were caught. 
 [shouting] 
 The gods are delivering this curse into everything around them. 
 It's in their clothing, the food that they eat, even the very walls that confine them. 
 Amun : So your answer is to burn them? 
 It is indeed the gods who delivered this curse upon us. 
 But it is only they who can deliver us from it. 
 When? 
 When the entire city is infected? 
 Half the population dead? 
 The army further decimated? 
 Can we not station more guards outside the gates? 
 Impossible. 
 New cases continue to spread outwards from its perimeter. 
 This sickness grows like a dam within those walls. 
 Soon, it will burst forth like a flood through the rest of Thebes.

 Vizier? 
 I'm afraid I agree with the General. 
 We cannot risk spreading this disease through the rest of our kingdom. 
 It must end here.

 Nearly as long as you. 
 Men don't see things the way we do.
