 Frantz :  So, what, you want the parade, the whole nine, all that? 
 Put 'em in the ground right. 
 We're ready to make this a reality. 
 Nicholas Talman and Ronald Dacey claim no ownership to GenCoin. 
 (screams) 
 I know what you are. 
 So then you understand why it'd be best to never look back. 
 You're using us just like you use everybody in your life! 
 It never leaves you. 
 It's just business. 
 Alex Bell. I need information. 
 What makes you think I can get it? 
 Isabelle Morales could. 
 I need my people. 
 I can't. 
 Ronald Dacey, Nick Talman, they're the real heroes of GenCoin. 
 I'm not supposed to open it. 
 Alex! 
 Thank you. Yeah. 
 Super good to talk to you again. 
 Man : So you're at the new offices right now? 
 Yup. Yeah, we're here in Wynwood. 
 Still ramping up the team, trying to move towards launch. 
 Man : And when is that gonna be? 
 Have you set a hard, fast date or...? 
 Well, we're still testing the beta on different platforms, we're finding our network, all the necessary bits and pieces. 
 We don't want to rush it, obviously, but there's also the feeling that the world shouldn't have to wait any longer for GenCoin. 
 Man : Well, it certainly seems that way. 
 If you could, go ahead and explain this to me, 'cause I guess I'm a little, I don't know, thick when it comes to these sort of things. 
 What is it? 
 Is it like a PayPal? 
 (computer chimes) 
 What would you compare it to? 
 Well, PayPal is a digital payment system. 
 It's not its own currency. 
 GenCoin is. 
 It's like... okay, so, you could pay for something with a dollar or you could pay for something with yen. 
 Or you could pay for something with GenCoin. 
 So, it actually is its own currency? 
 Yes. 
 (theme music playing) 
 Delfia : Do you like it like that? 
 Is it okay? 
 Izzy : Yeah, it's all right. 
 'Cause you don't have to have it like that. 
 I really don't care. 
 It's cool, sis. 
 Do I stink? 
 What? 
 Do I stink? 
 Give me that. God, I can't stop sweating. 
 Thanks. 
 Adolfo : Izzy? 
 Someone to see you. 
 (Adolfo and man speaking Spanish) 
 Isabelle. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 Did you get the stuff I sent you? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yes, I did. 
 Let's... there is somewhere we can talk? 
 Yeah. 
 (both speaking Spanish) 
 The thing is, you would have been protected as an equal partner, but this third party, Eden Field... were you aware that Alex Bell owns it? 
 And he is a controlling board member of Eden Field, which legally makes him two-thirds participant in GenCoin. 
 No. 
 No. That's bullshit. 
 He didn't tell me that part. 
 It's fully disclosed in Eden Field's contract with GenCoin. 
 "Contract"? He didn't show me that! 
 He didn't have to. 
 And he knew you wouldn't ask for it. 
 Isabelle... why you didn't bring this to me? 
 All I could think about was this was the dude. 
 This guy, he had the money, and he was gonna make it real. 
 I'm really sorry about this. 
 (car alarm beeps) 
 All right, go ahead and put it on the hood. 
 Hey, Gilles, count that. 
 Okay. 
 So I take it Alex didn't want to show, huh? 
 He's spread a little thin at the moment, but he sends his regards. 
 I'll bet you he do. 
 Hey, hold up, though. 
 This seem like only about 300 in here. 
 You know it 'posed to be 450. 
 We were unable to get that amount approved. 
 Are you sure you want it to go down like this? 
 Try to understand, Ron. GenCoin... 
 No, I understand that you short. 
 That's what I understand. 
 You're welcome to call your lawyer. 
 Otherwise, I'd let this one be. 
 (car door opens) 
 (car beeps) 
 (car door closes) 
 (car doors open) 
 (car doors closing) 
 (engine starts) 
 (priest speaking Spanish) 
 Love is sorrow, Love is benign. 
 Love has no envy. 
 Love is not boastful. 
 Love does not make vain. 
 Does nothing wrong. 
 Does not look for profit. Does not get angry. 
 Has not resentment. 
 Does not enjoy with the injustice, but enjoy the truth. 
 Suffers all, believes all Expects all, bears all. 
 And now keeps on faith. 
 The hoppeness and love. 
 All these three but the most is the love. 
 (chuckles)

 (cheers, applause) 
 Bravo! 
 (festive music playing) 
 (no discernible dialog) 
 Permiso. 
 Are you guarding the stash? 
 (both chuckle) 
 Isabelita, huh? 
 What a job your mom did. 
 Must have been a lot of chaos around here. 
 Yeah. 
 I know Marta. I know her. 
 Yeah, she... she took it very seriously. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 How have you been? 
 I feel like I didn't see you since you came from... 
 California, right? 
 Just workin' on new stuff. 
 Como que  "new stuff"?  Como que  "new stuff"? 
 Aye, mi amor. 
 Your dad told me that you start your own company! 
 Something about tech, right? 
 Mm hmm. 
 Yes, yes, he told me you have a big, fancy office and everything. 
 Um... 
 I'm gonna go take this... 
 To your boyfriend? 
 I will meet... (chuckles) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You stashing Papi's beer again? 
 No, I just... needed a minute. 
 We're cutting the cake in a bit though, all right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll be there. 
 Delly? 
 Yeah? 
 You look beautiful. 
 I know. 
 (ominous music playing) 
 (muffled music playing) 
 (ominous music continues) 
 (people speaking Spanish) 
 (muffled laughter) 
 (bottle shatters) 
 (engine revving) 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 Izzy : You should try locking the side gate. 
 What's wrong with the front door? 
 I didn't think you would open. 
 I, uh... 
 I have some things I need to say. 
 I need to explain myself. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Okay? Um... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Great. 
 Everything's better then. 
 Let me explain myself. 
 I think you know what you're gonna say. 
 No, I got pushed out too, Nick. 
 I'm out of my own thing. I'm done. 
 Oh. 
 He brought in a third partner. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 This, uh, server farm. 
 A network management company. 
 It turns out that he owns it, too. 
 (scoffs) 
 Which makes him a majority, then he single-handedly voted me out. 
 The lawyers called it a hostile takeover. 
 Yeah, it's a thing. 
 He owns my code. 
 GenCoin. 
 My life's work, it's his just like that. 
 Well, that sucks. 
 Yeah. Anyway... 
 Yeah, anyway, now you're sorry, 'cause you've got nothing. 
 I tried to bring you guys back in. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I tried. 
 But everything was a mess and you know that. 
 I didn't know what to do. 
 I just wanted GenCoin to work. 
 That's all I cared about. 
 It was bigger than you or me or Ronnie or... 
 Okay, I hope that makes you feel better. 
 Let me show you the front door. 
 Maybe if you wouldn't have treated me like a f*cking crazy person, and had some respect for me... You are a f*cking crazy person! 
 You don't know me! 
 I know you're f*cking crazy! 
 You don't know nothing. You know why? Because you have all of this. 
 You don't know me either, all right? 
 So watch what you say. Rich white people problems! 
 You don't know me and you don't know what I've been through. 
 You have no idea what I've been through. 
 Boo f*cking hoo. 
 Your daddy ran out on you. 
 Don't f*cking say that. Don't f*cking say that. 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't know you, you don't know me, and I don't know what goes inside your... 
 (clattering) 
 (both breathing heavily) 
 Come on, son. 
 You let your old man work you like that? 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. Hey, hey, try again. Try again. 
 Back me down. 
 Back me down. 
 A'ight. 
 Try to stop me, a'ight? 
 Just try to stop me. 
 Why you let that bitch play you like that? 
 The hell you talking, boy? 
 The girl who come up in here in the Escalade, showed us a whole bunch of bills. 
 It's complicated. 
 That's all I'll say. 
 Ain't you the man now? 
 Ain't this your hood? 
 And you gonna let some white bitch roll up in here and diss you like that? 
 That white bitch, she clipped up with the Russians. 
 Now, I'mma get that money. 
 But you gotta be smart about that sh1t there. 
 Yeah, Pap. Whatever. 
 Don't "whatever" me. 
 All right? 
 'Cause this some serious ass sh1t right here. 
 Stone cold. 
 You gotta know when to be the man... and when to be the bigger man. 
 You feel me? 
 (ball bounces) 
 Should have murked them all. 
 (clears throat) 
 That's all I'm sayin'. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 I should have killed them all? 
 Yup. 
 Just killed everybody there, huh? 
 Yup. 
 Just bap, bap, bap, bap? Just killed all them, huh? 
 Yup. 
 Just shot 'em dead, huh? 
 Shot 'em dead. 
 Shoot 'em in the face! 
 Should've killed them like that, huh? -Yeah. 
 Killed 'em dead, right? 
 They ain't here no more. 
 They're gone. I should have just killed them, right? 
 You should have shot them in the face! 
 Son, it's okay. 
 You did what you had to do. 
 You understand this? 
 You did what you had to do. 
 You did what you had to do. 
 A'ight? 
 You did right. 
 (sobs) 
 Just let that sh1t out. 
 No, no, no, no, it's all right. 
 That's my boy right here. 
 (sobbing) 
 This my boy right here. 
 (door opens) 
 You all right? I'll be right back, all right? 
 You did good. You did good. 
 (clears throat) The hell she doin' here? 
 
 
 
 Nick : We have to talk. 
 Izzy : Just hear us out. 
 Listen, we all need to talk. 
 Hey, Nick, what is she... come on, man. 
 I know. 
 It's ridiculous right here. 
 Izzy : What's ridiculous? 
 You being here. You know what you did. 
 Come on now, Nick. You got some explaining to do. -I'm sorry. 
 He doesn't have to explain anything. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I am sorry for what I did, and "sorry" doesn't cut it, and I know that, but I have no other words other than "I am sorry." 
 This right here is GenCoin. 
 There's no GenCoin without you. 
 We had a plan to get the company back. 
 You want in? 
 (phone rings) 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 Hello. (clears throat) Hello. 
 (gagging) 
 (keyboard clicking) 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 Vera : I'll see you in the morning. 
 'Kay. 
 I moved Eden Field to 11:00, so you could get some rest. 
 I'm fine. 
 What? 
 It had to happen. 
 We gave her fair chance. 
 (scoffs) 
 Some dogs can't be chained. 
 She would have bitten us all. 
 (snorts) 
 Maybe just you. 
 (keyboard clicking) 
 Vera? 
 GenCoin can't wind up like the others. 
 It won't. 
 (salsa music playing) 
 Rask : Hi. 
 So this the little nigga who took our cash. 
 Chain of title for all of Alex's shells. 
 Plus, a paper trail for every single dollar that he's made, spent, or invested since 2002. 
 She even hacked all his p0rn accounts from college. 
 That was just for fun. 
 Nice work. 
 How'd you get it? 
 I hacked his sh1t way before you came to us. 
 Our girl got trust issues. 
 So... what's the catch? 
 Nick : The catch... is that you're not gonna use that to blackmail him. 
 Ronnie : You... work for us now. 
 Nick : You're gonna use it to bring him down without implicating us in any legal activity. 
 (laughs) 
 I don't think you understand how this works. 
 Izzy : We don't? 
 No. 
 Izzy : Hm... 
 Ronnie, do... do we not know how this works? 
 sh1t, girl. I don't know. I don't know, man. 
 Are we just... does he got the drop on us, Nick? 
 Oh, it's tough to say. 
 Izzy : Super hard. 
 Let me know when you're ready. I'll press play. 
 What is that? 
 Izzy : Listen. Put it on. 
 Why? 
 Why don't you listen and then we'll talk? 
 Just listen to the motherfucking tape. 
 This your demo? 
 Yeah, please. 
 (keyboard clicking) 
 Rask :  I'm sorry? 
 Daewon :  You kill the girl yet? 
 Rask :  What? 
 Daewon :  You kill the girl yet? 
 Rask :  You ever ask me that again, 
 I'm gonna put a bullet through your head. 
 I don't want you asking me that again. 
 Daewon :  She saw me. 
 Rask :  Yeah, I know. 
 Daewon :  She see this. She see you. 
 Rask :  Yeah, yeah, I know. 
 I know. You're a genius. 
 You let me deal with that, all right? 
 You deal with getting me my f*cking money. 
 (music continues) 
 (upbeat music playing) 
 Alex : We're gonna probably need to scale up the team pretty soon. 
 I want at least two new people who are solely dedicated to interfacing with Mimi about network management on both ends. 
 I have a guy who's based here if you want to meet him. 
 He flies back and forth to Austin, so he knows some of the Eden Field people already. 
 I'd love to meet him as soon as possible. 
 Are you still aiming to launch on the second? 
 Ideally. 
 But the beta hasn't been proven across all platforms yet, and I still... 
 Nico : It'll work. 
 We'll test it, and it'll work. 
 So we can launch on the second. 
 Yes, well, Nico says we can launch on the second. 
 (doorbell) 
 Hi. 
 If we wanted to launch on the second, how many transactions per day do you think we'd be ready to host? 
 Well, we'd have to scale up way quicker. 
 Um, it's not impossible. 
 Just takes money. 
 'Kay, well, we have money. 
 Sorry, guys. Uh, one sec. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Alex. 
 I know. Uh, Phil Rask. 
 FBI, Financial Crimes. 
 Nice to meet you, Phil Rask. 
 You too. (chuckles) 
 Uh, if you could... 
 Rask : Excuse the interruption. I know you're busy. 
 Oh, uh, no, it's okay. 
 Can... uh, did Vera ask if you want... 
 She did, thank you. Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Okay then. 
 What, uh... 
 And how... how can I help? 
 I need money. 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah, I know about Minsk. 
 I know about Helsinki. 
 I... I'm... 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Don't f*ck with me. 
 I have over 400 pages of documents linking you directly to Kostya Vetrov and Mark Yegorov. 
 I have those. 
 Not FinCEN. Not the FBI. Not the CIA. 
 Me and me alone. 
 Are... are... 
 (drums on table) 
 I don't understand. Are you blackmail... 
 I'm blackmailing you. Yeah. 
 Now, I'm going to assume that somewhere here you have a reserve of cash. 
 Uh... 
 Good. 
 Well, I want all of it in there right now. 
 I... 
 Shut up. 
 Be smart, okay? 
 And you'll leave me alone? 
 You have to help me. 
 Please. 
 Help me. 
 Make them go away. 
 Pleasure. 
 (zips bag) 
 (car trunk clicks) 
 (Vera snaps fingers, speaking Russian) 
 (struggling) 
 (man speaking Russian) 
 Vera : Who gave you this? 
 Who gave you this sh1t? 
 Okay. (laughs) 
 The yard is finally back to normal. 
 Thank god. 
 It only took two days. 
 Hey, what time is your flight,  nena? Nena? 
 Delfia : At 3:00. At 3:00. 
 But I have to get back soon 'cause I'm sure Eddie still hasn't packed yet. 
 I'm so jealous. I mean, we haven't gone away on a trip in forever, right, Papi? 
 What about the Bahamas? 
 Oh, my God. 
 That was our honeymoon, okay? 
 I know. 
 Hey, it's all I could afford. 
 How about Italy? Hm? 
 How about Italy? 
 I'm gonna have some more of this ham right here. 
 It's prosciutto. 
 (mutters in Spanish) 
 Oh, my... why don't we go to Italy? 
 Okay, but you're gonna have to be very nice. 
 Oh, my God. 
 When are we going? 
 Nevuary. 
 Soon. 
 (laughter) 
 Marta : You think that's funny? 
 (laughter) 
 (Haitian music plays) 
 Izzy : What do you think? She's not joking. What do you... 
 You know what? They should have gone to Cuba. 
 What is she gonna do in Cuba? She can smoke weed in Jamaica. 
 Come on, honey. 
 She's right, Mom. It's something different. 
 Can you imagine Eddie? 
 (chattering) 
 Adolfo : He'd never make it back. 
 He'd forget his name, that poor guy. 
 (phone rings) 
 That was a good joke. 
 No, Mom, I'm serious. 
 I gotta take this because Jamaican me crazy. 
 That's not funny, baby. That's not funny. 
 What do you think they're gonna be doing? 
 She's gonna bang. 
 You guys, I should go. I should get back. 
 Izzy : They're going to. 
 Delfia : Yes. 
 Don't touch me. I'm gonna get cake. 
 (Marta laughs) 
 That sh1t was good. 
 (gunshots) 
 (car peels away) 
 Delly? 
 Delly? 
 Marta : No, no, no! 
 (screams) 
 Adolfo! Adolfo! 
 (Adolfo and Marta speaking Spanish) 
 What happened? What happened? 
 Call someone! Call someone! 
 Call someone! 
 Marta : Call somebody. Miguel, call somebody. 
 (sobbing) No, Delfia. 
 Delfi, no... (sobbing) 
 Ronnie : Hey, kid, if you don't face this now... 
 I remember my first. 
 I was a minute younger than you. 
 I still remember the smell of the heat on my fingertips. 
 That sh1t... 
 That sh1t wouldn't go away. 
 I remember... 
 I remember smelling it when I went to take a bite of this ham sandwich my old girl made me. 
 And I remember thinking, saying to myself... 
 "This the first time I'm eating as a person who killed someone." 
 I remember taking a shower thinking... thinking the same thing. 
 "This the first shower... since becoming a killer." 
 I remember riding a bike. 
 First time playing ball. 
 First time, first time. 
 All as this new person. 
 And the funny thing is, the nigga that I killed, I don't even remember his name. 
 (phone rings) 
 Hey.  
 (Izzy sniffles) Nick. (tires screech) (engine revving) Ronnie :  I remember I shot him 'cause I had to. It was me or him. But after I squeezed that trigger... I let that sh1t change me. Get inside my bones like some cancer all up and through every part of who I was. I let my sin define me, grind me down to the man I thought I 'posed to be. But you ain't got to do that, son. This town... it's what you make it. You need to know that. You got a choice. We all got choice. Life about choice. And the choices I make, they ain't always gonna be pretty. Hell, matter of fact, sometimes they gonna be ugly. There's gonna be people gunning for us. And I ain't talkin' about them kids you throw down with in Little River or even them Towners. Dawg, I'm talking a whole lot worse. 'Cause here, where we at... every move you make, it come with a price. So He will knock them down... Ronnie :  And you got to be willing to pay that price... (priest continues speaking) Ronnie :  ...and move on... Priest : Hear the sound of my prayers... Ronnie :  ...and know that it's worth every tear. Priest : I raise my hands... Ronnie :  Every ounce of sweat. Priest : Don't drag me away... Ronnie :  Every drop of blood. 'Cause this ain't America, kid. This here is Miami.
