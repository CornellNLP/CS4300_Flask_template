 Whoa. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Whoa! 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Oh, Jesus! Come on! 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Jesus! 
 No, no, no, don't stop. 
 I can wait. 
 Hey, honey, do me a favor, get back on the horse. 
 Listen, a guy is never more truthful than just after he's cum and I want complete honesty from him now, so please. 
 Suck a dick for a white man, come on. 
 Is... is he... 
 Are you serious? 
 What? 
 Are you serious? 
 About what? 
 About me staying here. 
 Do you want to go to jail? 
 I'm kidding. Okay, come on. 
 You're not going to jail. You can leave. 
 Come on, now, let's go! 
 Jesus. 
 Congratulations, anyway. 
 What are you doing here, Phil? 
 Vadik Koronev, $640,000. 
 Marina Jimenez, $560,000. 
 We've already been over this. 
 Yeah, but now I got proof. 
 Your Vietnamese pal, Daewon Phan, we seized his laptop. 
 Uh, so... 
 You want to take me in? 
 Like you did with Ed Adler? 
 Guy was sailing the Mediterranean two days after you cuffed him. 
 Never even saw the inside of a jail cell, and neither will I. 
 Neither will you, that's right. 
 You know why? Because I've not come to arrest you, I have come to be your friend. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Because friends share. 
 Andrew? 
 Do you want to be my friend? 
 How much? 
 Half. 
 Half! 
 Your last deal came to about 2.2 mil. 
 I want half and I will leave you alone. 
 I can't get you half. 
 I will leave you alone. 
 I can't get you half. 
 Shut up, dick f*ck! 
 You don't talk over me. 
 You don't do that! 
 I want half of what you made on your last move, or I make one phone call and you might not go to jail, but the entire score will be seized. 
 That's not good news for you, considering who that money belongs to. 
 I'll need a couple of days to tee it up, make sure there's no red flags. 
 Sure. 
 I'll meet you... 
 To make the transfer... 
 Together. 
 Like friends do. 
 No. 
 Is this really how you want to do this? 
 Yes, it is, yeah. 
 Just like the other guys. 
 I thought you were better than that. 
 Me, too. 
 Me, too. 
 Whoo! You good? 
 Are you going to be home all day? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 You don't know? 
 Yeah, I don't know. 
 I got stuff to do. Why? 
 You got stuff to do, okay. 
 I have a UPS coming, but I have to go to this meeting. 
 You got more stuff coming, really? 
 Look, you gotta put that somewhere else. 
 Put it where, Chad, I can't afford a place. 
 My electric was 600 bucks last month. 
 No lay is worth that much. 
 Izz, come on! 
 It was a joke! 
 Izzy! 
 Izz, come on, I was joking. 
 What? Are you suddenly going to pretend like you have feelings for me now? 
 I liked you. 
 Izz. 
 You don't like anyone. 
 You pretend to, just so you can get things from them. 
 You're a user. Look, I feel like a dick that I let it go on this long, but I... 
 Jesus Christ! Are you serious right now? 
 Get out! 
 This is my house! 
 Get out! 
 You're insane. Get your sh1t, get the f*ck out! 
 Go! 
 There's understandably lots of confusion from clients about which way to go, and unfortunately, there's just no clear answer, because of the uncertainty of the liquidity of the dollar. 
 Dad, Dad, can you please be careful with that? It breaks really easily. 
 Okay, sweetie. 
 Babe, is that you? 
 Yeah! Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, how was work? 
 It was good. Thanks. 
 Hey, my dad's home. 
 Hey. Right. 
 Hey, Nick. 
 Hey, Leo. How are you? 
 I'm good. I'm sorry, I'll get out of your hair. 
 I'm just helping Tay move some stuff. 
 No, thank you. 
 Thank you so much. 
 So, are you loving it? 
 Yeah, I mean, who could not love it? It's amazing. 
 I... don't know how we'll ever repay you. 
 Well, don't worry about it. 
 It's a good starter, you know. 
 Sure. 
 So, how's work? 
 Work... work's okay, yeah. 
 I don't know. I'm thinking about, maybe... 
 I don't know, I've been thinking about a few other things lately. 
 Yeah, Nick is thinking about starting his own micro-financing firm. 
 Well, I've been wanting to do something that makes a difference to anyone, ever. 
 Baby, what do you think about this mirror? 
 We've been talking about where we should put it. 
 Hey, Nicky, it's your father. 
 I was wondering if you could, maybe, come down to The Keys tonight. There's something I... 
 Need to talk to you about. I'd rather do it in person, you know. 
 Delfi. 
 What? 
 Come. 
 Taste this. 
 It's okay. 
 I'm joking, Mom. It's awesome. 
 Delfi, you cannot sit these people together. 
 Why not? 
 They'll kill each other. 
 Adolfo. Adolfo! 
 It's stained. 
 What's that? 
 Izzy! Izzy! 
 No, no, no, no, hey! These are not living here. 
 I got nowhere else to put 'em. 
 Oh, really? 
 Hey, I got an idea. 
 How about a job, huh? How about renting an apartment? 
 How about this is my job? 
 What? You're going to tell me that people are paying you for this? 
 They will, soon. 
 What? 
 Hey, sis. 
 Hey, Delly Belly. 
 Corazon, this might be better in your room. 
 No, Dad, it's not enough amps in there. 
 I've been telling you that since I was 12. 
 What happened to Pookie-head? 
 Pookie-head kicked me out. 
 That sucks, but can't you get another place? 
 I'm out of cash. 
 Oh, big surprise there! 
 Step off, Mom, I swear... 
 Marta! Izzy! 
 Please! Por favor! 
 Seriously? 
 I got the biggest pitch of my damn life tomorrow. 
 Gencoin? 
 Yeah, this private loans dude's bringing me in. 
 Is this her blog thing? 
 No, Dad, it's not. 
 Do you even know what a blog is? 
 It's a currency. 
 A digital currency that's going to change the world. 
 Oh, it's going to change the world? 
 Hey, you've been saying that for years! 
 It's not tied to any governments, any banks, any regulations. 
 Anybody in the world can use it. 
 All you need is a cell phone. 
 I don't think you have one of those, do you? 
 I got a flip phone. 
 You can't use... 
 Just let her stay for a while. 
 It'll be nice to have the two of them together again. 
 You know what? I did not sacrifice my entire savings... sacrifice? 
 Yes, sacrifice, to send you to Stanford... 
 I was not begging you to go there! 
 Hey! For you to run around and create... 
 What? What is this? Like, computer games? 
 Whatever the hell this is! 
 Hey! Guess what? 
 I let that molly-popping key rat cum inside me for a year so I could build the algorithm for Gencoin. 
 Don't lecture me on sacrifice. 
 Huh, that was quick. 
 We shouldn't do this anymore. 
 You drunk yet? 
 How's work? 
 I could use a shower. 
 f*ck! f*ck! 
 Let's start over. 
 All right? 
 What's stopping us? 
 All my stuff's still in storage. 
 It's like a day of unpacking. 
 Yeah. 
 I can quit. I can quit all of it. 
 We can travel, like we always said we would. 
 Huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 China, Thailand, anywhere. 
 Cheryl, do you wanna? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you wanna? 
 Yeah. 
 We have to call off the dogs first though, huh? 
 You had me there for a second. 
 No, wait. 
 I'm serious. 
 You're so full of sh1t! 
 How long did you plan on keeping that up for, huh? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Till all the lawyers went away? 
 Till you got your pension? 
 f*ck you, I don't even get my pension, you get my pension. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You cut your hair? 
 No, I didn't. 
 Well, it looks good. 
 Remember that one? 
 Yeah. 
 Scotch? 
 Uh, no, thank you. 
 Well, I'm going to have one. 
 I thought you quit drinking. 
 I did. 
 So, how's work? 
 Uh, work's fine. 
 Good. Good. And how are things with... 
 Taylor. 
 I know. Taylor. 
 You guys doing okay? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Why am I here? 
 Are you sick? Why did you call me? 
 How about we go for a ride? 
 What are we doing? 
 Uh, Nick, you know what I do. 
 You know where I get my money. 
 Well, I'm out of options. 
 The feds are all the way up my ass. 
 You are the only person I can trust. 
 There's over two million dollars here. 
 I need you to move it. 
 What? 
 There's routing numbers. 
 Instructions on where to funnel the money. 
 I just need it to land by next Tuesday. 
 Oh, my god. Pull the car over! 
 You go through Valencia... 
 Do it yourself! 
 They froze all my BFO accounts. 
 I'm not kidding. 
 But you can move it, and nobody would ever see a trace of it. 
 Pull the car over right now! Just pull the car over! 
 Fine! 
 Wait! 
 My entire life, I have tried to atone for all your bullshit, and make something decent of myself. 
 Why do you insist on dragging me down with you? 
 It's not going to happen. 
 They're going to kill me. 
 I lose this money, it gets seized. 
 I'm going to owe some very dangerous people. 
 If something happens... 
 You really want that hanging over your head? 
 Dada... 
 Guess what? Touie want me to show you something. 
 Guess what it is? 
 Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
 Your brother tell you to do that? 
 Yeah. 
 You sure? You sure? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
 If you're lying, I'm going to find out. 
 I'm going to tickle you again. 
 Hey, Touie, you tell your sister to squirt me? 
 No. 
 Hey, Els, your brother done sold you out. 
 Touie! 
 What time did you get home last night? 
 Before you did, pop. 
 Hey, breakfast will be ready soon, okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Good morning, love. 
 Good morning. 
 Ooh. 
 Uh-uh. Quit it. 
 Touie, who's that? 
 Oskar. 
 What's up? 
 Got that towner, dawg. Right where you say he'd be. 
 Where he at now? 
 The room. 
 Hold on. 
 What up, dawg? 
 What they do, O? 
 Oh, sh1t, yo! 
 This game dope. When'd you get this? 
 Last week. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Okay. 
 Stop it. 
 Hey, turn it off. 
 Get something to eat. 
 What'd Jey have to say? 
 He's still in Tampa. 
 He didn't pick up his phone. Came to get you. 
 How long he been there? 
 A few hours. Ain't been talking much though. 
 What they do, big man? 
 Those Tam's ribs? 
 Last of 'em. 
 sh1t's outta control out here. 
 Lucky sumbitch, ya know that, right? 
 She reminds me every day. 
 What's up, big Ronnie? 
 You hear we got that towner? 
 Think I'm doin' here, E? 
 Gonna do to 'im, big dog? 
 That's up to him now, ain't it? 
 All right. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy, now. 
 sh1t'll cut you up. Bleed out 'fore we start. 
 Just breathe, my nigga, just breathe. 
 I ain't like the rest of these fools though. 
 I'm just here to talk. 
 You like French toast? 
 My wife, she's a helluva cook. 
 You don't need no syrup on this sh1t or nothing. 
 This sh1t just melt in your mouth. 
 She learned from her old girl. A real Haitian. Try some. 
 You good? 
 See now, Mo. 
 You done made my breakfast all cold. 
 I need something to heat this up with. 
 Now I'd like to go back and finish the rest of it before it all get cold, too. 
 So I'll make this quick now. Who shot Joelle? 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 You do know. 
 I don't. 
 I really don't. 
 Revis and his boys call all the shots, but you and Lowe and the rest do the dirty work, ain't that right? 
 Ah, see. 
 Now I can warm my sh1t up. 
 Thanks, Yo. 
 Please. 
 Oh, damn, Mo, look at that. 
 Look at that sh1t. 
 All right. All right. sh1t happens sometimes, okay. 
 Nigga got a secret. 
 He knows what a g-code like me's willin' to do to get it. Ain't that right? 
 I can't. 
 Come on, Mo. 
 You already done pissed yourself. 
 It can't get much worse. 
 Come on, dawg. 
 You know I can't. 
 All right, then, I'll just dry your sh1t off. 
 Hold still! Hold still! 
 Last chance, Mo. 
 Then I burn that sh1t off, I eat that for breakfast instead, you feel me? 
 I can't. 
 What did you say? 
 Davis. 
 Davis. 
 My nigger. 
 You did good. You did good, blood, you did good. 
 Cut him loose, make sure he get back across 95. 
 Say what? 
 You heard me. 
 That ain't how we do. 
 I'm the one who say how we do. 
 Jey-jey'd want me to waste 'im. 
 He didn't kill nobody. Davis did. 
 Eye for an eye. That's how we do... 
 And I ain't with this old testament sh1t, Dawg. 
 Now when Jey-Jey gets back... 
 It's on me. 
 You understand? 
 When Jey-Jey get back... 
 It's on me. 
 Now untie him. 
 Make sure he get back over the bridge to overtown without no trouble, and that's it. 
 Y'all go on workin' your corners, selling kush up to ybor, do whatever the f*ck it is you'll do up there. 
 We going to do what we do down here, you understand that? 
 All right. 
 Hey. Good morning. 
 Hey. 
 Can I finish this? 
 I'll make some more. 
 You working today? 
 Yeah, I gotta go and help Sheena. 
 She got overwhelmed. 
 But I'll be home in time for dinner. 
 You want to do some boxes? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Okay. 
 Have a good one. Bye. 
 Bye. You, too. 
 
 
 
 Miss Morales? 
 Yeah. 
 They're ready for you. 
 Thank you. 
 Did you know that in Saudi Arabia a woman can't open her own bank account? 
 In Indonesia, the instability of the rupee makes it impossible to maintain a business. 
 But what if, what if there was a currency they all had access to? 
 A currency they could call their own. 
 A currency with no borders, free of government decree, with no threat of confiscation. 
 Did you know? 50% of the world population, that's three and a half billion people don't have access to a bank account, but by 2020, almost all of them will have a cell phone. 
 That's power. 
 That's Gencoin. 
 Uh, sorry, is it like PayPal? 
 No, PayPal is an online payment system. 
 It works with whatever currency you put in it. 
 Gencoin is a currency in and of itself. 
 It runs off a complex algorithm. 
 It took me almost seven years to develop. 
 It predicts, it adjusts and adapts to foreign markets and political shifts in order to remain stable. 
 How is it any different from other peer to peer systems like Bitcoin? 
 Bitcoin? 
 It's a cute idea. I mean, its code is open source. 
 True democratization of money. 
 Which makes it susceptible to third party interference and ultimately corruption. 
 Here's what's up, folks always saying that money corrupts people. 
 But what everyone fails to recognize is that people corrupt money. 
 Gencoin can put an end to that. 
 It offers more stability, security and anonymity than any digital currency out there. 
 And it works? 
 Still in beta, but it works. 
 Um, how much would you need to get started? 
 What are you looking for? 
 $100,000 in seed money. 
 That'll allow me to build a secure enough network to run a true prototype. 
 With that, I can lure larger investors. 
 Eventually, I'll need 12 million. 
 That sounds very interesting, but I have just one concern, all this Bitcoin, crypto-currency stuff. 
 I've been reading up on it and if I may, its ultimate success looks pretty... 
 Well, it just looks pretty grim for the banking community. 
 Well, look at the record companies, the movie studios. 
 They didn't want to adapt to the digital age. 
 Now they're getting smoked by Spotify, Netflix, YouTube. 
 It's the same thing. Traditional banking, digital currency. 
 That train is leaving the station my friends, so you either jump on-board or get left behind. 
 Well, very intriguing. 
 We're going to chat internally. 
 Yeah? And we will circle back with you. 
 Okay? 
 Thank you very much. 
 It was great. 
 Right. 
 You've reached Andrew Talman. 
 Please leave a message. 
 Andrew? Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 Prick. 
 This girl's so smart. 
 I mean, child prodigy, went to Stanford, she just has absolutely no idea how to sell herself. 
 Yeah, but there has to be a reason why people aren't buying. 
 Like, you're the only one. 
 I think it's a, sort of, inclination to be afraid of what you don't know or understand, and I think it's people scared of the future. I think... yeah? 
 Yeah. Well... 
 Okay, I don't really understand what exactly it is. 
 Gencoin? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a currency. It's like any other currency, but it's digital. 
 Um, it's not tied to any government or bank. 
 So, anyone on earth can access it. 
 And how does it actually have real life value? 
 It has the value that we collectively ascribe to it. 
 Same as any of this. 
 For instance, this bottle of wine, you know, that your aunt got us. 
 We could agree that this is worth $1000. 
 You want me to believe Or if I said, that it's a $1000 bottle of wine? it's worth $1000 for me to part with it, and you said, it's worth $1000 for me to have it. 
 Then it's worth $1000. 
 I get it. 
 But... I know you do. 
 I know you do. 
 But I still would not pay $1000 for that shitty bottle of wine. 
 We're drinking it. 
 We are. 
 Cheers to... 
 The start of the next chapter together. 
 Cheers. 
 I love you. 
 I love you. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 It's all that wine. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Hang on. 
 It's okay. 
 Hang on. 
 It's okay. 
 I'll be back. 
 Oh, you don't... 
 You don't have to do that. 
 Okay. 
 Hello? 
 Hi. Is this Izzy Morales? 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, this is Nick Talman. 
 We met earlier today. You came in for a pitch. 
 Yeah. 
 Um, look, I'm sorry to call so late, can I buy you lunch tomorrow? 
 I thought you guys passed. 
 This is not Valencia talking. This is just me. 
 I would like to buy you lunch. 
 Big man. What it do. 
 What it do. 
 Come on. 
 Straight? You all right? 
 All good. 
 What Sid have to say? 
 His boy day called in the whole bus-load of choppers. 
 Got them things coming down from Atl next week. 
 Yo, Oskar told me what went down yesterday though. 
 Disobeyed me. 
 You know I ain't for that. 
 Come on, man. He do what he knew I'd say. 
 Murkin' towners, they just gonna come back at us, Jey. 
 You got big dreams, huh, Big Ronnie? 
 You dream big, huh? 
 You making moves with that money or what? 
 Look, Dawg, you know the money good. 
 Come on, man, I trust you, Dawg. 
 I trust you. I know you. 
 I don't know them niggers. They ain't Haitian. 
 We done been through this, Jey. 
 Ever since the feds came up in here... 
 I ain't trying to hear about no feds, though. 
 Yeah, but I'm saying, Jey. 
 We ain't got the muscle that we used to, and every nigga from overtown to Lib City know it. 
 But you see how the Cubans do it. 
 Yeah, I see they got banks. I see they got ports, they got unions, all that. 
 But Cubans got all that 'cause Uncle Sam say they do. 
 But what we got? 
 What we got? What are they going to do for us? 
 Only reason any of this still here, Haitians back there, these cribs... 
 Man, all this is 'cause of force! 
 It's 'cause they know not to f*ck with us 'cause we come at you, Dawg. 
 Pull you out your house if we have to. 
 You feel me? 
 You for that, nigger? 
 Yeah, I'm for that. 
 Come here. 
 How much is this boy going to need? 
 About 20 large. 
 All right, I'll go pay that cracker a visit. 
 So it starts as an app, right? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 And then, obviously we find a way to entice people, incentivize users. 
 I've already sketched out a couple of models in my prospectus. 
 I saw that. I know. It's totally great. 
 It's legit, too. My code. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. 
 I have no doubt. 
 But you don't want to audit it or anything? 
 I do, but... look. 
 I'm not investing in the code, I'm investing in you. 
 All right? I know what you're capable of, so I'm investing in the idea. 
 Even if the code didn't work... 
 It works! 
 I'm sure it does. 
 My code is the sh1t. 
 I know. 
 I'm just saying, even if it didn't, with the money I'm prepared to give you, we can hire a team and make this about more than a code. 
 We can turn this into something very real that has the power to change the world. 
 How much money? 
 Thousand? 
 Two million. 
 No way. No way. 
 No, no. This is a joke. No, you think I'm joking. 
 These are routing numbers to off-shore... come here, please. 
 These are routing numbers to off-shore bank accounts. 
 The money's already set up and ready to be wired. 
 Off-shore? 
 Yeah, it was given to me to take care of. 
 I'm trying to do the right thing. 
 I don't want to know where it came from. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 I've been to every bank on Brickell Ave. 
 I've hit up every lender from here to Tampa, VCS that I still know out west. 
 I know, they're all scared. 
 Yeah, they're scared of what it can do to their way of life. 
 Sure. 
 When they see me, they see... 
 They see an anarchist. 
 They see a crazy Chonga, is what they see. 
 This is my life's work. 
 A last chance. 
 Okay. 
 All these here? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, you know what? Why are you breaking 'em up like that? 
 I'm putting them in digital shell corps. 
 That way, anytime we take money in, it's completely untraceable. 
 Okay, is it... 
 Very, very safe to store money like that? 
 It's more than safe. 
 I built the encryption. 
 It's better than what all the major banks are using. 
 Okay, really? 
 Yes, really. 
 Positive? 
 Completely positive? 
 Would you rather take this to a bank? 
 I mean, do you trust me? 
 Yeah. Yeah, do it. 
 Okay. 
 Hi, Gencoin. 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah. Where Andrew... 
 Andrew Talman? 
 Oh, you just missed him. 
 He's taken a leave of absence as of yesterday. 
 For how long? 
 Um, indefinite. 
 Where'd he go? 
 Um, I'm not sure. 
 Is there something I can help you with? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we opened up an account a couple of weeks ago. 
 Uh, I just need to take a little piece of it. 
 Uh, did he tell you who will be managing your account in his absence? 
 He didn't tell me he was leaving. He wouldn't pick up his phone. That's why I'm here. 
 I see. Okay. 
 Well, can I get your name? 
 Dacey. Ronald Dacey, D-a-c-e-y. 
 Dacey. 
 Is there something wrong? 
 When did you say that you opened the account, Mr. Dacey? 
 Last Wednesday, I think it was. 
 It's just that, um, there's no record of you here in our system. 
 What they hell are you talking about? 
 Are you sure you're in the right place? 
 Are you for real? 
 Are you being for real right now? 
 Do you... do you still have the welcome packet? 
 Did he... 
 He didn't give me no packet. 
 You think I'm messing with you? 
 No, sir, it's just... 
 I don't know what else to tell you. 
 You can tell me... 
 Where my goddamn money's at. 
 Hi, Nick. 
 Um, there's an agent Rask here to see you. 
 He says he's FBI. 
 He's already in your office. I tried to stop him, but he just... 
 He went in. 
 You couldn't stop him? 
 No. 
 What does he want? 
 He didn't say. 
 What's his name? 
 Agent Rask. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Agent Rask? 
 Call me Phil. 
 Okay. Hey. 
 Nick, didn't mean to snoop. 
 No, no, not at all. 
 It's what they're there for. 
 You fish? 
 Um, you know, I used to, hard to find the time. 
 What is that, tuna? 
 Yeah, that is a blue fin. 
 All the way out here? 
 No, no, no. 
 Cape Hatteras, actually. 
 You're kidding. We used to go there every summer. 
 I didn't know there was good tuna. 
 There's some of the best actually. 
 That's got to be satisfying, right? 
 Pulling something that big out of the water? 
 Oh, yeah, it is. 
 Always meant to learn, but just can't get away. 
 You know I haven't had a vacation in seven years. 
 It's brutal. 
 Seven. 
 Wow. 
 Mind if I sit? 
 Please, please. 
 You're not in trouble by the way. 
 Huh? 
 You know I'm a federal agent, right? 
 Yes, that's what Selby said. 
 You look nervous is all. 
 As if you're in trouble. You're not. 
 No, no, I think... 
 Maybe the gun, I don't know. 
 Oh, right. 
 So is that your girl? 
 Yes, uh, Taylor is her name. 
 Wife? Fiancée? What? 
 Just girlfriend for now. 
 We're not putting... 
 I mean, that's a label, but I... 
 What's a label? 
 "Girlfriend." 
 I was going to say, we're not putting labels on it, but we are she's my girlfriend, but... 
 Right. 
 It's all for right now. 
 Well, lock that down. 
 She's a knockout. 
 Yeah. Hey, I'm working on it. 
 Good. Good. 
 Where's your dad? 
 We had a meeting. He didn't show. 
 Can't find him. It's like he's skipped town. 
 So I'm wondering, where'd he go? 
 Huh. 
 Well, I don't... I... 
 I can't say I know. 
 We hardly talk anymore. 
 Except for the other night. 
 We did. We did talk the other night. 
 So what did you guys talk about, your dad and you? 
 I think it was mostly, if I recall, it was mostly a catch-up. 
 He definitely didn't say anything about leaving town. 
 So just small talk then? 
 Again, you're not in trouble. 
 Is he in trouble? 
 He teach you how to fish, your dad? 
 Um, he did, a long time ago. 
 That's great. 
 It's nice, you know, it's important to have those memories of your old man. 
 See, my dad, he shot himself when I was off at school. 
 .38, under the chin, pow. 
 Jesus. 
 Dumb b*st*rd, couldn't even do that right. 
 The bullet ricocheted off his jawbone, took out his left eye, ripped off a piece of his brain, didn't kill him straight away, he had to be on a vent for two whole months before he passed. 
 Two goddamn months with all of us just standing around watching him fill a bag with sh1t waiting for him to go. 
 My god. 
 Huh? 
 I said, my god, that's... 
 That's awful. 
 If there is a god. 
 What kind of god, right? 
 Right. It's a great question for another time, maybe. 
 There'll be another time. 
 I don't want to keep you. 
 Oh, uh, listen, no problem, let me know if there's anything I can do, okay? 
 If you hear from your dad, it's really important I speak to him. 
 Yeah. Absolutely. 
 So what'd you use? 
 What did I use? 
 To catch the tuna? 
 Not just worms, I'm assuming. 
 No, not worms. 
 I use herring. 
 Sometimes I go with scad. 
 So just smaller fish then? 
 Yeah. 
 Right. Hmm. 
 You know, one of these days I'm going to retire, you're going to take me out there, show me a thing or two. 
 Okay. It's a deal. 
 What? 
 I will. 
 If you want, I can... 
 Let me know. 
 Huh? 
 Let me know. I mean, like, let me know and I will... 
 Anytime, really. I mean, I have to find the time, but, you know... 
 You know, doesn't sound like you're retiring anytime soon, so... 
 I'm just saying you haven't had a vacation. 
 It seems like you work hard. 
 They work you. I know the feeling, so... 
 But if you find the time, I will also find the time. 
 Thanks, Nick.
