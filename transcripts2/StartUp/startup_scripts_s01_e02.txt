 Your last deal came to about $2.2 mil. 
 I want half or the entire score will be seized. 
 [On phone] Hey, Nicky. It's your father. 
 I need you to move these funds. 
 That's not gonna happen! 
 They're gonna kill me. 
 What if there was a currency with no borders, no threat of confiscation? 
 With the money I am prepared to give you, we can turn this into something that has the power to change the world. 
 Hi, GenCoin. 
 Jey-Jey will want me to waste him. 
 [Gunshots] 
 You got big dreams, huh, Big Ronnie? 
 You're making moves with that money or what? 
 Where's your dad? 
 There's no record of you here in our system. 
 [slams table] 
 Help! 
 [Car driving on dirt road] 
 [Thuds, groans] 
 Help! 
 [Pounds] Help! 
 [Shouts] Help! 
 Help! [Breathing heavily] 
 [Brakes squeak] 
 [Car stops] 
 [Car door opens] 
 [Car door shuts] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Okay. Okay. 
 What did I do? 
 Shh, shh. 
 Where am I? 
 Just tell me what I did. 
 [Groans] 
 [Ronald clears throat] 
 Damn. 
 You ever been hit like that before, dawg? 
 Throw ya off your sh1t, don't it? 
 Makes you all woozy. 
 [Clears throat] 
 You know why I brought ya out here? 
 Hey, yo! [Snaps fingers] 
 South Beach, you with me? 
 Only reason anybody come out here... is to catch a gator or feed a gator. 
 And I don't care for gator meat. You chew that sh1t forever. 
 This is a mistake. 
 This is a mistake. 
 You're Nick, ain't you? 
 Your bitch-ass daddy, he say he could take our cash, clean it up, make it safe. 
 Next thing you know, the money gone. 
 Ain't that some sh1t? 
 So, here's what's up... 
 You tell me where your old man at... or you turn into gator food. 
 It'll makes no difference to me. I know I'mma get that sh1t eventually. 
 When I'm done with you... 
 I'm goin' right on down the line. 
 Every sorry-ass bitch you care about, right down to the nigga that does your dry cleaning. 
 You, I'll probably shoot you at the back of the head right there. 
 Just be done with it. 
 But your loved ones? 
 sh1t. 
 You should see what I can do with a blade. 
 It's amazing how long you can stay alive with your guts all hangin' out... 
 I have your money. 
 I have your money. 
 [Theme music playing] 
 [Rock music playing] 
 [Machines whir down] 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Marta : Isabelle! 
 Adolfo : Sorry. 
 It's that circuit board again. 
 I've been meaning to get a new one. 
 Marta! 
 Marta : Isabelle! 
 I got it, Ma. Hang on! 
 I was in the middle of e-mailing. Now I have to start over? 
 Izzy : It happens. 
 Only when you're here, it happens. 
 Adolfo : Marta, settle down, okay? 
 Marta : Oh, yeah. Don't walk away from me. 
 Mom, just chill. Okay? 
 Marta : Okay. End of the week,  chica. 
 End of the week. I want you out end of the week. 
 Delfia : Seriously, the power went out again? 
 What happened? 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Nick :  Where are you right now? 
 Nick : It's open! 
 Izzy, this is Ronald. Ronald, Izzy. 
 Um, it turns out some of the money that I gave you... belonged to Ronald and he would very much like it back. 
 How much is some? 
 Nick : Uh, $300,000. 
 Did you bring your laptop? 
 [Softly] Should we do the pitch? 
 What are you talking about? 
 [Whispering] f*cking GenCoin! 
 I don't think he gives a f*ck about GenCoin. 
 Listen, Ronald, Nick went ahead and invested your money in a startup. 
 My startup, GenCoin. 
 It's the future of currency. 
 Here, let me just show you. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Wait, wait. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Easy. Easy. 
 Easy. 
 It's just my laptop and a prospectus. 
 Just... just hear me out. 
 Please, just... 
 That three hundred, it started off as cash, yeah? I'm assuming. 
 Under some floor board or mattress or whatever! 
 Believe me, I know. 
 My family, we used to be clipped up with the Cuban Mafia back in the day. 
 If I had created GenCoin back then, they would have been moving money internationally, locally, completely undetected. 
 Forget scamming the bank. They would have been the bank. 
 Look. 
 If you invest in GenCoin, help us make this a real thing, okay, your money, it turns into a digital currency. 
 It's untaxed, unregulated, untraceable. 
 Suddenly, you're not on some corner slinging rocks. 
 You're moving whatever you want, in the comfort of your own home. 
 It's the future... Not just of crime, but of commerce. 
 It's the future of a truly free market. 
 The question is, Ronald... do you wanna be a part of it? 
 [Laughs] 
 Come here. 
 [Pats couch] Sit. 
 I am sitting. 
 I just wanna talk. 
 Just do what he says. 
 What you say your name was, again? 
 Izzy. 
 Izzy. 
 Is it short for Isabelle? 
 Hmm. 
 Mmm. 
 That's pretty. 
 I want my money, Isabelle. 
 I can... I... I can make a transfer to any bank account. 
 No, no, no. Come on! 
 You don't wanna do all that. Just give me the cash. You feel me? 
 Yeah, but no bank has that much cash on hand. 
 I need a couple of days. 
 Couple of days? 
 Hmm. 
 Here's the thing, Isabelle. 
 I need cash. 
 A'ight? 
 If it's sitting in some bank somewhere, that sh1t ain't my problem. 
 That sh1t's your problem. 
 That sh1t is South Beach problem. 
 24 hours. We meet back here. 
 You give me my three hundred... 
 [Emphatically] in cash. 
 If you don't do that... 
 Well... sh1t. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door shuts] 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Classical score playing] 
 [Music continues on headphones] 
 [Music stops] 
 [Groans] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Shower running] 
 [Yawns] 
 Hey, good morning. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What time did you get in last night? 
 Really late. 
 Eric was just so wasted. I had to drive him. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Um, do you know where my socks are? 
 Mmm. Probably in a box. 
 Do you know what box? 
 No. 
 All right. 
 There's so many boxes. 
 Mmm. Okay, I'm up! 
 Um, your phone has been ringing off the hook. 
 Sorry. 
 That's fine. 
 Mmm. 
 That sort of client information is... well, I need a subpoena. 
 I... I hope you understand. 
 No, that's fine. 
 Of course. But listen, if anyone does hear from Andrew, then, uh... please call me, immediately. 
 And, uh, I'll be back with that subpoena. 
 Come again. 
 All right. 
 I'm sorry, I wish I could do more... 
 No, please. You're just doing your job. 
 You are, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Just doing your job? 
 That's right. 
 Fine job it is. 
 Thank you. 
 Take care, Carl. 
 You sure this is gonna work? 
 You mean, he can just trade us a bunch of routing numbers for cash and that's it? 
 Huh? How do you know this guy? 
 Stop talking. 
 Okay. Well, it's just 300 grand is a lot to come up with in one day... 
 Well, you should have thought about that before you took the money from some Haitian gangster. 
 Hey, you didn't want to know. Okay? 
 Nick, if he hadn't seen my face, you would be on your own right now. 
 You took the money, Izzy. 
 You took the money, just remember that. You took the money. 
 Really? 
 What the hell? 
 Hey! What are you doing? 
 Izzy! 
 Hey, where are you going? 
 Where are you going? 
 For a walk. 
 Look, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't know it was his. 
 So who gave you that money? 
 My dad. 
 He works in finance. 
 He launders money through his bank. 
 For Haitians? 
 For anyone. Just literally anyone who will pay him. 
 You gave me the money to hide. 
 No, I didn't. No, I didn't. 
 I gave it to you because I believe in this. 
 I want to do it. 
 Okay I swear Look, I've spent my entire life watching this man line his pockets, so he could fly his mistresses around the world. 
 I swore I would never be that person. 
 Okay, so are we good? 
 So, we're good, then? 
 [Beeping] 
 Thompson :  You don't need a subpoena for that. 
 To pull all those clients' accounts? Yeah, I do. 
 All those clients' accounts? 
 Hmm. 
 You crazy? 
 You look at this? 
 Christ! It's like two ounces of chicken in this thing. 
 Well, I gotta turn over every stone. 
 Tell them, this is a guy who once stashed Russian mob money in a non-profit for disabled kids. 
 [Laughs] 
 That's not funny. 
 Look, he can't move the money that quick. No one can. 
 So, what do you want me to do, huh? 
 Help me help you. 
 All right, well, your boy Judge Frankel. 
 Nah! I can't go over Learmont's head like that. 
 You do it all the time. 
 [Whispers] Yeah, not for you. 
 Look, there's a reason that your division is still over in the old HQ building. 
 Think about that. 
 Can I finish my lunch? 
 Knock yourself out. 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Honking] 
 [Crashes] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Car door opens] 
 You pulled out in front of me, man! 
 You didn't see me coming? 
 Why you pull over like that? No signal. 
 Just... just fixed that bumper, man. 
 Mmm-hmm. Shh, shh, shh. 
 Jesus! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Get the f*ck away, man! 
 No, no. Come on. Hey. Come on. 
 Come on. It's okay. 
 You all right? 
 It's just a car. It's just a car. 
 All right? Calm. 
 I'm all right. You're all right. 
 This? [Scoffs] Who cares? 
 Oh, see this? 
 It's metal and glass. That's all it is. 
 Just metal and glass, my friend. 
 Just metal and glass. 
 That's metal and that's glass and that's metal and that's glass. 
 [Engine stops] 
 [Operatic music playing] 
 This is where he lives? 
 Yo, Elon. 
 Who's that? 
 He's good. 
 I'm good. 
 He, uh... Nick, come here. 
 Nick : Don't f*cking point a gun at me. 
 He's good, all right? He's a friend. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 [Lock clicks] 
 [Chain rattles] 
 [Music continues] 
 Let me see it. 
 I put everything we need in that one, second to last. 
 How much are you cashing out? 
 All of it. 
 Three hundred? 
 I can't do three hundred. 
 Busy month. I'm tapped out. 
 I got 80. 
 I can do 80. 
 That's it. 
 
 
 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Elsie : Dada! 
 Huh? 
 Dada! 
 Dad have biz. 
 Want to make a little tinkle. 
 [Knocking continues] 
 Take your life in your hands goin' in there. 
 Ew! 
 [Spraying] 
 Ew, Daddy. Stinky. Mom! 
 Ah! You're Trapped! 
 You are wrong for that. You know that line. No, I just... 
 Hey, where's Touie? 
 Oh, he said he, uh, went to go play basketball. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, did you see the picture that she sent? 
 She sent it to you, too, right? 
 [Hip-hop music playing] 
 Here. Some kinda sh1t, my nigger. Try this. 
 Yeah? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Feeling like grown-ass man, aren't you? 
 Got the tank top on. You swole, aren't you, huh? 
 [Coughing] 
 [Laughing] All right, I got you there, though. 
 Pass that right there. Yeah. 
 [Laughs] Messing with you, boy. 
 Put that away. Put that away. Dad! 
 What they do, Big Ronnie? 
 Why you tell your mom you was going to play basketball? 
 We did. We went and played basketball early. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 Come on. Get. 
 Dad, we just hangin'. 
 Maybe these ain't the cats I want you hangin' with. 
 sh1t, it's all good, big man. 
 Ronald : Stay outta this. 
 So you're gonna tell me who my friends are now? 
 For real, Pap? 
 You okay? 
 I'm good. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm good. 
 Stay down. 
 Let's go. 
 [Woman wailing, muffled] 
 [Muffled] Touie, call an ambulance! 
 Hey, Dave. 
 How's the hand, Hulk? 
 Eat a dick, Arlo. 
 Good morning, sunshine! 
 Hey, sugar. 
 Agent Rask? 
 Hmm. 
 Special Agent Madeline Pierce. 
 I just transferred down from D.C. 
 Pleasure. 
 Beautiful city. 
 Miami? 
 Right. 
 It's an upgrade for me. 
 I won't miss the winters. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, I, uh, just wanted to introduce myself. 
 Gotcha. 
 I'm at your disposal, so let me know if there's anything I can do. 
 Had a good cafecito, yet? 
 I don't know what that is. 
 Oh, really? 
 Let's go get one. 
 Right now? 
 Right now. 
 Okay, I'll... I'll get my bag. 
 Sure. 
 There you go. 
 Thanks, Pauly. 
 Mmm, wow! 
 That is strong. 
 That's good sh1t, huh? 
 Pauly makes the best stuff in town. 
 See you later. 
 Thank you. 
 Next. 
 So, the Andrew Talman file... 
 You seen that one? 
 Yup. Read that one. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 And, uh, The Sarkisian Cruise Liner... 
 Hmm. 
 And The Golden Phoenix chain with the Triads. 
 So, you read all of them? 
 Of course. Many times over. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, today is all about Andrew Talman. 
 I'm not sure how it works in D.C., but down here it's a little different. 
 I've heard. 
 See, this town... 
 All this is built on financial crime, right up to the top officials. 
 There are people who are working very hard to make sure that people like you and me don't get a fair shot at bringin' them down. 
 But if they play dirty, you know, means we can play a little dirty, too. 
 [Woman sobbing] 
 Tamara : Touie, you can't go! Touie, I ain't letting you leave. 
 Touie, get over here! Touie, come here! 
 Touie, Touie! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold up, son! 
 Step off, Pa. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up, son. Hold up. 
 He's fixin' to get himself killed. 
 You're tryin' to start some sh1t? 
 Huh? 
 Hey. 
 Yeah, Pop, that's what's up! 
 Oskar hit me up. 
 Said he got them OT niggas pinned. Needs some backup. 
 And you wanna go at it with them? 
 Is that what's up? 
 You wanna feel big, huh? 
 You wanna feel like a man, huh? 
 The killed Jules! 
 You wanna feel like a real man, huh? 
 Is that what you want? Huh? 
 I look at you. 
 I'm lookin', I'm lookin', I'm lookin'. This ain't the boy that I raised. 
 I didn't raise this boy. 
 Yeah? 
 Some "do what I say not what I do" bullshit? 
 I do what I have to, 'cause that's the way that sh1t ended up for us. 
 But I'm tryin' to change that. 
 I'm tryin' to change that for you, tryin' to change... 
 Some bullshit! 
 What! 
 Ronald! 
 Mom! 
 Ronald Come here. Calm down. 
 Come here! 
 Ronald. Ronald! 
 Come here. Come here. 
 Ronald! 
 Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. 
 Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. 
 I was this close. You understand me? 
 This close to losing you today. 
 You don't know what that's like as a father. 
 You can't know what that's like. 
 Tomorrow might not be so lucky. 
 It might be Elsie. 
 It might be your mom. 
 You run around starting fires with Oskar... and this whole place gonna burn. 
 Touie... you feel me? 
 Come here. 
 Come here. 
 sh1t. 
 Don't you have friends that you can ask or something? 
 To what? Just hand over a pile of cash by sundown? 
 Yeah! 
 No. 
 No, I don't know anyone that would willingly give me a pile of cash by sundown. 
 There is this. Let me throw this out there. 
 Throw it out. 
 All right. It's called smurfing. 
 It's a structured money movement. 
 Now, we need 220 grand by tonight, but we can't go to a bank and withdraw that much. 
 However, we can walk into a bunch of different banks and ask for a little bit. 
 It will have to be less than $10,000 in each withdrawal, otherwise they will file a Currency Transaction Report with FINCen, and we can go to jail for a long time. 
 But less than ten, they're not gonna do that. 
 No, uh, wait, wait. 
 No one's going to notice that? 
 Well, if we do the same bank different branches, after a few they could file a Suspicious Activities Report, but that would take weeks to go through and I think we would... well, we'd be alive. 
 Well, that... no, no, no, no. That's a good idea. 
 I can cover our tracks. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. I'll take the remaining 220, I'll run it through my foreign shells, drop it right back into your personal account, smurf the sh1t out of it, and then weeks from now, when they come asking for it, it just looks like me and you are starting a company together. 
 Well, we are. Aren't we? 
 All right. We'll smurf. 
 All right. We can smurf. 
 All right, Liebowitz runs the investment side with Talman. 
 I struck out because the guy is a 40-something straight man. 
 So, you think I'll do better? 
 [Scoffing] I know you'll do better. 
 Look, he doesn't have to do anything without a subpoena but the decision is still his, and I guarantee you he won't be able to resist that face. 
 This doesn't feel right, doing it like this. 
 Now, I know. But it's 48 hours at best until the judge signs that warrant. 
 In that time, Talman could have moved his money three times and then we are f*cked. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 Okay. 
  Hang on. 
 It'll help. 
 [Sighs] Here it goes! 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 Ma! Ma! 
 Are you serious? 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 What is all that sh1t? 
 This isn't your garage,  mija. 
 I have something time sensitive. 
 It's a hundred degrees in here! 
 Go inside. 
 Delfia : It's okay, Mom. We'll do it in the yard. 
 Marta : No, no, no. 
 We got everything right here,  mija. 
 Mom, it's fine! 
 It's fine. We'll just do it outside. 
 Don't worry. You're not bothering us. 
 Yeah, you're bothering me. 
 [Rock music playing] 
 Okeechobee, left, then Miracle Mile. 
 Okay, bye. 
 Dude, I don't think I'm gonna make it. 
 Drive a little faster. Stop driving like a white person. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Hack into the traffic lights? What do you think I have going on in here? 
 [Groaning] 
 [Sighing] It's 72 grand. 
 Okay. That's good. 
 That's 152. That's more than half. 
 [Sighs] I think we should go to the police. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 I promise you it is going to be better than what he is going to do to us. 
 No. I promise you, we're not going to the police. 
 That's more than half. It's a good gesture. 
 A gesture? 
 Yes, a gesture. 
 Well, so it's like a fruit basket? 
 It's like an Edible Arrangement? 
 We have to be at your dad's soon. So how about you man up? 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God! This was a bad idea. Nick, you idiot. 
 What's a bad idea? We're out of time. It's the best we could do. 
 No. All of it, all of it. I shouldn't have called you. 
 I should never have taken that money. 
 But you did. You called me. 
 You said we would change the world. 
 Remember? Now you're scared? 
 Yeah. Can you tell? Does it show? 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 I mean, I know we have the gesture, but still. 
 Such a little girl. It's cool. 
 All right, when all this is over, I'm gonna go my way and you can go back to your cushy vanilla life, where you feel real comfortable and not scared. 
 I'm scared there, too. 
 Hola, corazon. 
 Hey. 
 Jey-Jey : We gotta send a message! Let everybody know from Overtown to Carol City. 
 If a nigga think he gonna f*ck with us in our hood, little Haiti, we're gonna come at you ten times bigger. 
 You kill one of us, we gonna kill ten of y'all. 
 You light up a little crib, we gonna burn down your damn neighborhood, nigger! 
 We're gonna cover the streets of Overtown in blood! 
 [shouts] Yeah! 
 [Chanting] 
 [Group chanting] 
 Could you point that elsewhere, please? 
 You know how to use that? 
 My dad used to take me shooting out in the swamps. 
 My little sister, Delfi... she used to get so jealous. 
 She said,  "Papi,  why can't I shoot, too?" 
 He'd tell her, "Corazon... you're not gonna need a gun to take care of you." 
 "You'll have a man. Izzy, she's gonna need to take care of herself." 
 Oh. That's messed up. 
 [Car approaching] 
 [Car door opens, shuts] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 That it? 
 Okay, that's some of it. 
 We're gonna get the rest tomorrow. 
 Ah! 
 No, you're not. 
 You ain't gonna do that. 
 You're gonna put it back... in your coin thing. Put it back. 
 All of it. 
 Are you looking to invest? 
 Nah. I want more than that. 
 I wanna be your partner. 
 Sit down. Sit down. 
 Ah, I'm... I'm confused. 
 Izzy : You were just fixin' to kill us. 
 You got me thinking... with your little speech, Isabelle. 
 Some next level sh1t. You know? 
 And for an LH7 like myself... things been rough for us, last few years. 
 Watchin' everybody else come up. 
 The Dominicans, the Ricans, and the Haitians? [Scoffs] 
 Don't nobody wanna let us have ours. 
 But this... 
 This is where it's at right here. 
 What you got going on, right here. 
 And, Nick... 
 I know I was rough with you. 
 It's how I gotta do sometimes. 
 You feel me? 
 But this ain't me forcing y'all into nothing. 
 It's just me, Ronald Dacey, businessman, husband, father of two, telling both of y'all I believe in what y'all doing and I want to be a part of it. 
 Look... 
 Nick gave you laundered drug money to start your company. 
 You a smart girl. 
 Pretty face. 
 Why not go out there and ask for the real thing? 
 I did. 
 I asked everyone. 
 That's right. 
 And they all said... 
 "No." 
 And why is that? 
 Because they're scared. 
 They're scared what GenCoin can do to the financial system. 
 Boom! 
 You know who ain't scared? 
 This nigger. 
 People I know. 
 Nick : Oh, I, uh... 
 I mean, that sounds really dangerous. 
 These are legit business folks I'm talkin' about, not just street thugs. 
 No, of course. 
 Hey, look, bro. We in Miami. 
 Them dudes sittin' up in them Ivory Towers on Brickell? [Scoffs] 
 Ain't much difference between them and the dudes I know. 
 Izzy : I like it. 
 Nick : You do? 
 We still need $8 million to get GenCoin on its feet. 
 Where else are we gonna get it? 
 Well, you know, I got a lot of phone calls to make. I know a lot of people. 
 And so does he, why not give him a shot? 
 Ronald : One more thing. 
 The rest of that money you got from your old man... 
 Where did that come from? 
 Still unclear. 
 Right. 
 So when them folks come looking for your skinny white ass same way I did... you might want some muscle around you.
