 GenCoin. I'm talking about a new currency. 
 You know how many broke-ass niggas come knocking on my damn door with their hands out? 
 Nick : Just imagine owning a fraction of every dollar spent in the United States. 
 Izzy : 1.5 mil. What about Ronnie? 
 Do we still need him? 
 Nick : We have the seed money, and he is dangerous. 
 All right, one job. 
 You get your sh1t back. I don't chase you anymore. 
 How's that? 
 Nick on radio :  I feel like this warrants it. 
 (gasping) 
 Who this? 
 I'm leaving. 
 No, you're not. 
 (Maddie breathing heavily, distorted) 
 (heavy breathing continues) 
 (thumping) 
 Rask : Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. No. Come on. 
 Come on. Don't do that. Don't do that. 
 (Maddie groans) My head. 
 Rask : Yeah, I know. You took a fall. 
 Let's get you some ice, okay? You fell. Hold on. 
 Maddie : I need to go to the doctor. 
 Rask : I know. Maddie? Maddie? 
 Maddie! Maddie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 You just got to lie still. Lie still. 
 I'm gonna get you some ice for that head. 
 I'll be right back. I'll be right back. All right? 
 I'll be back. I'll be back, Maddie. 
 I'll be right back, okay? 
 (heavy breathing continues) 
 Whoa, Nelly! Whoa, Nelly. Come on. Come on, come on. 
 Let's... let's get you back in there. 
 I gotta go to the hospital. 
 Maddie. Maddie! 
 A doctor's coming. Okay? I'm need... 
 Maddie? Maddie. Maddie. Maddie, Maddie, Maddie. 
 Just lie down. 
 (sighs) Okay. 
 Here's the ice. Come on. Put this on your... 
 Maddie? Maddie! Stop struggling, huh? 
 Stop struggling, okay? Okay? You can't... 
 I wanna go. Let me... 
 (mutters) Jesus Christ. 
 (sighs) Maddie. 
 What are you doing? What are you doing? 
 No, no, no, Maddie. 
 What are you doing? No! 
 Maddie, Maddie, Maddie. 
 No! No! 
 Maddie? 
 No! Phil, what are you doing? 
 No! No! 
 All right, stop. Stop. 
 Don't do that again. Okay? Don't f*cking do that again. 
 (sobbing) 
 Don't f*cking do that again. 
 Maddie. Come here, please. 
 Come here. Maddie? If you don't give me your arm, you're gonna break your f*cking head open. 
 Come here. Come on, come on. 
 Honey? Maddie? Maddie, look at me. 
 All right, look at me. I'm not touching you. 
 (shouting) 
 Maddie? The more you struggle... the more you struggle, you're gonna hurt yourself. 
 Okay? I do not want you to hurt yourself! 
 I don't want it, Maddie. Please, just give me your arm. 
 Just give me your arm. I don't want you to get hurt. 
 Please. Please, let me go. I won't say anything. 
 Maddie. 
 Please let me go. Please! 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Honey. 
 Sit down. Honey? Sit down. 
 Honey? Sit down. 
 Phil. Phil! 
 I am in hell! Stop! 
 Phil. Phil. Phil, don't go. 
 Phil! Phil. Phil. 
 Phil! Phil! 
 Phil! 
 (theme song plays) 
 (woman screaming) No! No! Ali! 
 Why? Why? 
 Why? 
 No! 
 Why? No! 
 Why? Why? 
 (screaming continues) 
 (people whispering) 
 (screaming continues) 
 Man : You got that? 
 (people whispering) 
 Man 2 : What we gonna do? 
 (jingling) 
 (phone vibrating) 
 (hip-hop music playing) 
 (Latin music plays) 
 Can I just have a quick look? 
 Izzy : No, no, no. No, no, no. 
 I just want... I just want to... 
 You... you know what you're gonna say. Gimme this. Stop! 
 So then... 
 You're gonna... no. 
 You're gonna give it to him. 
 You're gonna give it to him. 
 Okay. 
 You're gonna say what we decided, and that's that. 
 I'll be there if you need me. 
 So... right. 
 Okay? 
 I'll do the talking, and if... what I'll... what I'll do is, if I need you, I'll just look to you. I'll do a silent... 
 Okay. You don't need to look at me. I'll know. 
 I'll know if you need me. 
 Okay. 
 But probably not. Probably not gonna need you. 
 Can you stop? 
 What? 
 You're making me nervous. 
 Why? 
 'Cause you don't stop. Relax. 
 He's not gonna do anything here. 
 Yeah, not here. But later... 
 Not later. It's business. He's gonna understand. 
 I should... you know, I feel like, um... 
 Let me pee first. 
 Hurry up. 
 (toilet flushes) 
 (zippers) 
 (groans) 
 (faucet runs) 
 (hip-hop music playing) 
 (music stops) 
 So, uh... we initially brought you in... as a partner. Um... which was really good. It was great. 
 Um, and then we all agreed that we would go out and we would find more investors. 
 And so that's what we did. We all, uh... we-we... 
 We need to move on without you, dude. 
 Nick : This is our, um... 
 This is our offer. Will you just hand that to him? 
 This is offer. It's, um... it's... officially offer you two percent in perpetuity... a passive two percent, mind you... as well as the repayment of your initial 300. 
 You literally don't have to do anything. 
 I mean, you'll be making money sitting on your ass. 
 It's a sweet deal, if you ask me. 
 Nick : It's very fair. 
 Nope. 
 So, no? 
 I reject your offer. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. No. 
 That's, uh... that's not an option. 
 Why not? 
 'Cause we voted. Two to one. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 You voted. Two to one. 
 Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 
 That's... that's right. 
 Or... or, may I just add, forget it. 
 Because the other thing is I can see a version where three partners is pretty great, actually. 
 So I think let's forget it. Let's just order breakfast. 
 It's fine. 
 No. No, that's not up for discussion. 
 Why not? 
 It's up for discussion. 
 Ronnie, I'm sorry, but we made a decision. 
 Why? 
 Izzy : Why what? 
 Did I stutter? 
 No. No, you didn't stutter. 
 Why'd you make the decision? 
 Well... 
 Because we landed Benedict Blush for 1.5. Nick did it. 
 Basically, we're legit now. 
 Big Nick. 
 Your nuts finally dropped. My nigga. 
 This is good, this is good. We back in business now. 
 sh1t's lookin' up. 
 There is no we. 
 And why not, Isabelle? Please. 
 Please explain that sh1t to me. 
 'Cause my dumb Haitian ass probably just misunderstanding what you college-educated white folks is talking about, is that right? 
 Izzy : No, it's not like that. 
 Then what's it like then? 
 Nick : It has nothing to do with where you're from. It doesn't have anything to do with where we're from either. 
 Izzy : You scare people. 
 The thing... no. 
 Let's be, you know, constructive. It's not... 
 You do, but the point is you're in a gang. 
 And that's a very dangerous element for us. 
 I'm here right now, because I was doin' business with your bitch-ass daddy, South Beach. 
 I'm sittin' right here, right now, because of that. 
 Ain't that some sh1t? 
 You wanna now what the only difference between a rich thug and a poor thug is? 
 You're here 'cause your daddy brought into this. 
 That's what I'm trying to correct. 
 Now you wanna start with this sh1t right here? 
 You don't think a Haitian know how to pull down 1.5 million? 
 That's what's up? All right. 
 Grab on to your dicks. 
 Just one second. I'll show you what's up. 
 Think he's coming back? Let's get the check. 
 Can we have the check? 
 Can we have the check, please? 
 (Maddie sobbing) 
 Phil, look at me. 
 Please. 
 Please let me go. 
 Look at me. Look at me! 
 Please. 
 Phil, look at me. 
 Please look at me. 
 Ah. (exhales sharply) 
 Maddie : It's not too late. It's not too late. 
 Please. Please let me go. 
 Please. 
 Phil. 
 (keyboard clicking) 
 (computer humming) 
 Mr. Rask. 
 Is it working? 
 Not 2.2 here. Only 1.8. 
 Whoa. What do you mean? 
 Only 1.8, but my fee still ten percent of 2.2. 
 That's not our deal, man. No, wait. Wait. 
 Sit down, please. 
 Deal. 
 You kill the girl yet? 
 What? 
 You kill the girl yet? 
 You ever ask me that again, I'm gonna put a bullet through your head. 
 I don't want you asking me that again. 
 She saw me. 
 Yeah. 
 She see this, she see you. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 I know, you're a genius. 
 You let me deal with that. All right? 
 You deal with getting me my f*cking money. 
 Ten percent of 2.2. 
 I know! 
 I get the f*cking deal! I understand! 
 Sure. 
 I think that went well. 
 Okay. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Hard life. 
 Hey, watch the road. 
 Come on, the road. Please. 
 I hope it's worth killing us. 
 Someone's hacking my sh1t! 
 They're taking all our money. 
 Our money? 
 Yes, our money! 
 Right now? 
 Yes, right now! 
 Stop it! Here, I'll steer! Just... 
 I need to go home. 
 Okay. 
 (horn honks) 
 Get out of the fast lane! 
 Izzy : sh1t. 
 Nick : Hey, what's... 
 Izzy : No, no, no, no, no. 
 No, no! Is that us? 
 Someone slaved my whole system. 
 You said this couldn't happen! 
 Who's doing this?! 
 I don't know, Nick! 
 But I need to cut them off! 
 Jesus! 
 Can we just unplug it? Can we start... 
 No, no! 
 That'll lock me out completely. 
 Oh, my God! 
 How'd they change my encryption key? 
 How'd they change my key? 
 What does that mean? 
 What do we do? 
 Nick, I need you to shut up for one minute... 
 All right. 
 ...so I can stop the bleeding. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Nick : Oh, my God, look at it. Look at it. Look at it. 
 (keyboard clicking) 
 (muttering) 
 (speaks Korean) 
 Oh, my God! Look at it! 
 It's bots. 
 What? What are bots? 
 It's bots. They're using bots. That's how they got in. 
 Slaving other computers and using them to attack this one. 
 Like these computers? 
 Are they using these? 
 No! It has to be from a different router. 
 It literally could be anywhere in the world, but... 
 Make it stop. Look, look! 
 Stop! Stop, Nick, I'm trying! 
 Jesus Christ. 
 They changed my encryption key. 
 That means they have to do it locally. 
 That's the only way. 
 Okay. 
 Means they're on my wi-fi. 
 Can we unplug the wi-fi? 
 No, that'll lock me out for good, I just told you that! 
 Go to the neighbors. 
 Okay. 
 Go to the neighbors... three houses in every direction. 
 What do I do? 
 Tell them to turn their powers off. 
 Turn the computers off. Turn everything. 
 What? 
 Yes! 
 They're not gonna listen to me. 
 Make it up, Nick, I don't know! 
 What do I say? 
 Make it up! 
 What do I say? 
 Something! Jesus! 
 I don't know! Go! 
 Do that! 
 Where Lance at? 
 Excuse me. Sir? 
 Sorry to scare you. Is this your house? 
 You... is there any way we could... 
 There's a medical emergency happening down the street. 
 (typing) 
 Suck my dick and choke on it! 
 (gasps) 
 (knocks, clears throat) 
 Nick, come on. Move quicker. 
 
 
 
 Hi. Sir, uh, I have a huge emergency. 
 I'm sorry... sorry to bother you. 
 Can I give you ten dollars and I can unplug your computer and your router for no more than ten minutes? 
 No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No. 
 No! God! 
 Hi. Sorry, I don't mean to scare you. 
 Habla inglés? 
 Um, do you have  computador?  It's, um, emergency. 
 Emergency. It's... (speaks Spanish) 
 No. No, no! No, no, no, no! 
 No, no, no! No! Oh! 
 Por favor ... unplugging... 
 (speaks Spanish) 
 Yes, Nick! Yes! 
 (gasping) 
 That's driving me nuts. Okay? 
 I can't hear myself think out there. 
 I need to think. 
 Come on. Come... come on, baby. Come on, baby! Ha! 
 I'm telling you, these greens are rigged, dawg. 
 I was hitting it from far away there, my man. 
 Yes, Nick. Yes, yes! 
 (sigh, pounds table) 
 Chat for a sec? 
 I'm in the middle of a game here, Ronnie. 
 I see that, bruh. 
 Ronnie :  I been letting you slide too long, dawg,  without paying your taxes. 
 Where our money at? 
 You puttin' up these fancy-ass buildings up in the hood, that niggas can't even afford, without paying taxes. 
 That sh1t goes through me, dog. 
 Step off, Ronnie. 
 Izzy : Okay. Okay. 
 I tried coming at you with some legit sh1t. 
 The right way. Somethin' that could help all us get up out the hood, and what you do, bruh? 
 You laugh in my face. 
 Ronnie, I didn't mean to laugh at you. 
 No, no, no. You laughed in my face. 
 Now I got to do business the way I know how. 
 So where my money at, dawg? 
 Step off. 
 You know what? Back up! 
 Did it work? 
 No, it didn't work! 
 I got 'em all! Come on! 
 Calling the cops. They're here. 
 Sometimes buildings burn, my nigga. 
 What you say to me? 
 I said sometimes, buildings burn, my nigga. 
 (gasping) 
 Look what's happening. 
 Well, network's not showing any other computers on wi-fi. So unless somebody has a hard... sh1t! Are you kidding me? 
 Where my money at, dawg? 
 Step off, Ronnie. 
 Where my tax money at? 
 Step off, Ronnie. 
 Where my tax money? 
 Don't do this sh1t today. 
 Where my tax money? 
 Go home, Ronnie. 
 Where my tax money at, bruh? 
 Go home! 
 Where my tax money at? 
 Go home.

 Hold it. Hold up. Hey.

 1.5 million. Give me my tax money, bruh. 
 (Marta yelling in Spanish) 
 Shut the f*ck up! Shut up! 
 (shouting in Spanish) 
 (grunts) 
 (sobbing) 
 Maddie : Please. 
 Let me go. Please. 
 I'm not gonna say anything. 
 (zippers) 
 I can help you. 
 Phil doesn't have to know. 
 Just let me go. 
 What? What? 
 Away. 
 Look away. 
 (urinating) 
 (footsteps approach) 
 Laptop. 
 It's yours. 
 Your fee... when I get... 
 Already took... from your account. 
 Well, I think we're done here. You can go. 
 I told you, I was gonna take care of that. 
 This is your mess. 
 You did that in there. 
 And I'm gonna clean it up for you. 
 So, you're welcome. Be on your way. 
 I wait. 
 Daewon. Dae... 
 Daewon... sh1t. 
 No, no! No! Help! 
 Freeze! Stop! 
 I'll kill you. 
 Yeah. I swear to Christ, I'll kill you. 
 Turn around. 
 Come on. Turn. 
 Gun is loud. 
 We all go to jail. 
 You'll be dead, my friend. 
 I'll go to jail. Put that down. 
 (knife clatters) 
 Not smart. 
 Get over there. Walk. 
 Walk. 
 Get your sh1t. Get your sh1t and get out. 
 Nice and easy. Now, get out. 
 Get out of my house. Just go. 
 Just go. Get the...

 She have to die. 
 You know she have to die. 
 What you just say? 
 She must what? (grunts) 
 She must what? Does that make you feel tough? 
 Hm? You with a knife? Do you feel tough now? 
 (grunts) No. 
 Do you feel tough now? 
 No. 
 No, you don't. 
 Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna walk away, and if you look at me, I'm gonna put a bullet through your head. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What? 
 Yes! 
 All right.

 (Maddie sobbing) 
 (siren wailing) 
 Ah. (laughs) 
 What up, Jey? 
 Big Ronnie, what it do? 
 Where Tam, man? 
 Yeah, I told Tam I'll get you this time. 
 So, Lance had to drop the charges, huh? 
 Yep. 
 Hm. sh1t. (laughs) 
 Hey, what that nigga do to get your ass rolling up on him like that, huh? 
 Had to have been something serious. Right? 
 Pissing off big Ronnie and all. 
 That's cool. 
 You know how I feel about that big britches nigga anyway. 
 That's why this sh1t hurt that you did this sh1t without me. 
 Way I see, we supposed to pull these kind of stunts together. 
 You feel me? 
 It's a different situation, dawg. 
 Oh, it's a different situation? 
 Well, a'ight. That 300. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah? Where's it at? 
 Is it at your place? I'mma need that. 
 What you need that for? 
 What I need that for? 
 Is that something you really gonna ask me? 
 Hey, that's hood money, dawg. 
 That mean that money belong to me. 
 What I need that for is 'cause I asked for it, nigga! 
 It ain't just under some floor boards, Jey. 
 It take time to get it. 
 I'll give you three days.

 Okay, okay.

 Stop. It's okay. It's okay. 
 It's... hey. Hey, hey. Hey. 
 (sobbing) 
 It's okay. 
 I'm a failure. 
 No, you're not. No, you're not. 
 Yes, I am. 
 No, you're not. You're not. 
 You're not. 
 It's okay. Come on. We can get it back. 
 We can get it back. 
 No, we can't. 
 Yeah, we can. Yeah, we can.

 Don't say that. 
 Don't say that. 
 It's all right. 
 I'm gonna let you go. You okay? 
 We can get it back. 
 Do you have any idea who could have done this? 
 Well, I mean, you can find out, right? 
 I mean, you can retrace the steps? 
 Nick, whoever did this is smarter than me. 
 They're better than me. They beat me. 
 How could I possibly find them? 
 Because you're you. 
 They beat you now. That's okay. 
 There's gotta be a way. You can try, right? 
 Nick, I'm tired. 
 It's okay. You can try, right? 
 I am tired. 
 Look at me. 
 I believe in you. I believe in you. 
 Are you saying it's impossible or you don't know how? 
 Is it impossible or you don't know how? 
 I don't know how. 
 That's okay. That's fine. 
 That's good. 'Cause then you'll find a way. 
 I'll help you. I'll help you in any way I can. 
 Let me help you. 
 Where do we start? 
 Get me a beer. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Dad! 
 Hey! How you doing, baby girl? 
 Fine. 
 What y'all watching? 
 Cartoons. 
 Can I watch with you? 
 Yeah! 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my God. You saw that?

 Here. Drink this. 
 Come on. 
 (softly) I need a doctor. 
 Phil. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I'm not gonna say anything. 
 I know. 
 Daewon did this. 
 I'll tell them it was Daewon and that he got away. 
 Yeah. 
 (breaths deeply) 
 I'll go with you. 
 I'll go with you, wherever you're going. 
 Wherever you're going with that money. 
 I want to be with you. 
 Maddie. 
 That's all that matters. 
 Maddie. 
 Nothing else matters. 
 We can't. 
 We can. We can forget this ever happened. 
 Stop. 
 It's not too late, Phil. 
 Please. 
 It's not too late. 
 (sighs) 
 We can take the money. 
 We'll go wherever you want. We'll find a beach somewhere. 
 I'll make you coffee. We'll lie in bed together. 
 Stop! All right? Stop! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Phil. 
 Just give me a second. Please.
