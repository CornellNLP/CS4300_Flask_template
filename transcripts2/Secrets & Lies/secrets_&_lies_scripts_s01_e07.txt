 Previously on "Secrets And Lies"...  
 My flashlight came back. Got to get rid of it. 
 It's in a safe place. 
 I can't help you. You can't afford me. 
 There's no upside for me until you get arrested. 
 You know what you did! 
 You destroyed my husband! 
 I can't. I can't. I can't! 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Christy : A 5-year-old is dead. 
 You slept with the woman across the street, and you're a suspect in a murder. 
 I hate you. 
 And I love you. 
 I am after Cornell. And I need your help. 
 Cornell only wants to close her case, and she will do that any way she can. 
 Help me end her. 
 No. 
 She's got the highest close rate in homicide. 
 Her stats are through the roof. 
 Nobody's that good. 
 And if she can't find evidence, she manufactures it. 
 I can't believe a word you say. 
 Fine, then don't believe me. 
 But there are plenty of people in prison who would tell you the exact same thing. 
 Take, for instance, Jennifer Barrett, her latest victim. 
 She just got framed into county lockup. 
 And if you don't get your head out of your ass, you're next. 
 I'm done trying to solve Tom's murder. 
 Hey, look, it's not about trying to solve the case. 
 If we can get proof that she's abusing her badge, then I can expose it and you get the monkey off your back. 
 I would never work with you. Get out of my way. 
 Hey. 
 You won't like prison. 
 When things happen, the guards, they punish you by looking the other way. 
 You did time? 
 Five years ago, I got to a murder scene, and these yahoos, they mistook me for a cop. 
 Cornell charged me with obstruction and i-impersonating and tampering. 
 I got a four-year bid. 
 I lost my job, my reputation, and my family. 
 Sounds like you had it coming. 
 Other reporters have done worse and got a slap on the wrist. 
 No. That was personal for her, and so is this. 
 You better do something about Cornell, 'cause I guarantee she's doing something about  you. 
 Where'd you go? 
 I almost called the cops. 
 That reporter, Arthur Fenton, he threatened our family. 
 So I went to deal with it. 
 "Deal with it." 
 You keep fighting, Ben. 
 Should make it really easy for Cornell to lock you up. 
 It doesn't matter what I do. 
 She's not gonna stop unless I stop her. 
 How are  you  gonna stop her? 
 [Man speaking indistinctly on loudspeaker] 
 I.D. 
 Sign in. 
 [Buzzer] 
 Now face the wall. 
 [Indistinct talking, door clangs] 
 All right, let's go. You know the way. 
 15 minutes. Make 'em count. 
 [Buzzer] 
 Are you looking for meth, teeth, and tattoos? 
 Uh, you just... Don't seem like the type that belongs here. 
 Are you? 
 No. 
 Then why are they giving you the glare? 
 I heard you got railroaded. 
 I don't want the same thing to happen to me. 
 I guess mom's been busy. 
 Mom? 
 Detective Andrea Cornell. 
 If Andrea's got her hooks in, you got to be a badass. 
 What'd you do? 
 Nothing. 
 Me too. But here I am. 
 Yeah, for drugs, in case you're wondering. 
 W-what about rehab? 
 My father asked the same question. 
 Andrea wouldn't budge. 
 The law's the law. 
 There's got to be something you can do. 
 I'm doing it. 
 With good behavior, I'm out in 18 months. 
 What is she coming after you for? 
 She thinks I killed a child. 
 Kind of sounds like Seth Goring all over again. 
 Who's that? 
 Prime suspect in the murder of a little girl. 
 Yeah, the cops couldn't prove it, and Andrea still chases him on her days off. 
 It's been three years. 
 But that's harassment. 
 Once you're on the wrong side of Detective Cornell, that's where you stay. 
 Confess now and get it over with. 
 [Buzzer] 
 Mr. Crawford. 
 Somebody called you? 
 I have a lot of friends. 
 Enemies too, I bet. 
 When a murder suspect comes and visits my daughter, I take that as a threat. 
 Is that what this is? 
 I didn't know she was your daughter. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Fenton : Ben. 
 You're a snake, man. 
 You set me up. 
 Okay, okay, listen. All right. 
 Cornell put her own kid in prison. 
 I needed you to see that for yourself to realize I wasn't lying. 
 If I told you who Jennifer really was, then you wouldn't have come. 
 So what did she say ? 
 Ask her yourself. 
 [Scoffs] I can't. I'm an ex-con. 
 I'd need special permission to visit a prisoner. 
 Just tell me what she said. 
 She didn't say a damn thing. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Jess : I just can't tell you how sorry I am. 
 Christy : Ben? 
 Yeah? 
 Hi. 
 Hi, Ben. 
 Christy, I never did th-thank you for those flowers. 
 They were beautiful. 
 Tom was a wonderful boy. 
 Always remember that. 
 Um, uh, see you. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 She came over to apologize. 
 I heard. 
 Did you put her up to it? 
 Yes, 'cause it's my dream to have my wife and the woman I cheated with in the same room, talking. 
 Where are the girls? 
 The mall. 
 How are you doing? 
 I'm fine. 
 I know what happened with Kevin was... 
 Something I'm working on. 
 It might help you if you talk about it. 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Ben Crawford. 
 Right now? 
 Fine. 
 Ben, you need a lawyer. 
 Just think... when she arrests me, I'll get one for free. 
 [Door closes] 
 Cornell : So, you have two options... confess and spare your family the horror of a high-profile murder trial... 
 I didn't kill Tom. 
 Or brace yourself for a full-court press. 
 'Cause they'll not only follow you, they'll follow your kids, your wife, your kids' friends. 
 They'll reveal all your secrets. 
 Well, you already did that when you leaked the news that I was Tom's father. 
 That was a crime-lab error. We're looking into it. 
 And I believe you. 
 You should. 
 I don't think you have any idea the nightmare that's coming your way. 
 Yes, I do. 
 I'm living it. 
 This is about your daughter. 
 This is about the dead 5-year-old that you found in the woods. 
 You can't tell me that this display, all of this, isn't personal. 
 I think you're being paranoid, and that's a symptom of PTSD. 
 You should really get help for that. 
 There's a third option you didn't consider. 
 What's that? 
 I can go home, and you can go to hell. 
 How's that? 
 Colors? What about the white sneakers? 
 They're too tight. 
 You've got to stop growing. 
 Hi, dad. 
 Hey, monkey. 
 Where's my hug? 
 Mom said I shouldn't hug you. 
 I said to wait for your dad to hug you first. 
 How'd I become the bad guy? 
 'Cause you're so good at it. 
 Michael has invited a lot of new people to his Christmas party this year. 
 Plenty of kids your age. It should be fun. 
 His parties are lame. 
 W... gay people are supposed to be, well, gay, aren't they? 
 Natalie! 
 Natalie, gay people can be just as boring as everybody else. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Where you been, man? 
 I getting the chill from frosty the snow lady in there. 
 Cornell brought me in, showed me all the evidence. 
 She had a flashlight front and center. 
 It's exactly like mine. 
 Oh, no. 
 Yeah, man. It made me anxious to get rid of it. 
 Okay. 
 Did you pick a hiding spot? 
 I'm thinking back behind the argyle mall, like you said, on the way to Michael's and in the woods there. 
 Cornell must have really spooked you. 
 What I hear about her, I'm going to prison whether I did it or not. 
 Hear from who? 
 Cornell's daughter. 
 You're talking to the cop's families now? 
 What, are you out of your mind? 
 Man, if I'm gonna get out of this, I got to prove that Cornell's crooked. 
 Okay. I get you. How? 
 I'm gonna track down this other guy she's been chasing and compare notes. 
 Take the secret files to the government. 
 It's a good plan. 
 The press. 
 Don't tell me. 
 The reporter who outed the doc and his sister... 
 Oh, wait, I mean his wife? 
 That guy sheds his skin, man. 
 You don't... you don't want to deal with that guy. 
 I don't need to trust Fenton to use him. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Ben : Hello? 
 Uh, who are you? 
 My name's Ben Crawford. I'm looking for Seth Goring. 
 Am I in the right place? 
 Uh... 
 Mom? 
 I know you. From the news. 
 Yeah, I've seen you before. 
 You were at the... the police station, yelling at Detective Cornell. 
 Can I come in? 
 Mom, don't talk to this guy. 
 Stay out of it, Jimmy. 
 It's okay. 
 We're gonna go pack our rooms. 
 Okay. 
 My boys have been through a lot. 
 Because of Cornell. 
 Yeah. You must know all about that. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 I... Wanted to ask your husband what she did to him. 
 A little girl was strangled. 
 Cornell claimed my husband had compulsions and that other girls came forward, as well. 
 All lies. 
 I mean, if it were true, Seth would've been arrested. 
 But Cornell kept coming back. 
 She wouldn't let go. 
 Every time we moved, she'd question our neighbors. 
 Had Seth been seen with any little girls? 
 You can just imagine what she made them think about my husband and about us. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, too. 
 You have no idea how much worse this is going to get. 
 Isn't there anything you can do about her? 
 Like lodge a complaint, call one of her supervisors? 
 We tried, but now there's nothing left to fight for. 
 Why not? 
 [Voice breaking] My husband just couldn't take it anymore. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I found him in the basement. 
 Hung himself a week ago. 
 Cornell hounded the guy to death. How is that legal? 
 How can she get away with... 
 No, exactly. 
 As long as there's an open murder, she can do whatever she wants to. 
 I can't go on like this for years. 
 Well, once I write about what Seth Goring went through at her hands, you won't have to. 
 You got to go. 
 I just got here. 
 Yeah, unannounced, and I have an appointment. 
 Cornell ruined your life. What's more important than that? 
 Seriously. You got to go. 
 You asked for information. Come on. 
 Yeah. I'll call you. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Car door opens] 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 [Beep, vibrating stops] 
 Hey, is, uh... is Fenton home? 
 Uh, yeah, he's... he's in back. 
 Name's Ben. 
 Linda. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Sighs] Mom's about to send out a search party. 
 Why? What's the rush? 
 Two more days till Christmas! 
 Dork. 
 Christy : I've been calling. We need to get on the road. 
 Where'd you go? 
 Errands. 
 Well, hurry up. We're gonna be late. 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 All right. 
 Oh! [Glass shatters] 
 Ben : Whose gift was that? 
 Michael's. 
 I guess I know what it is. 
 It was my fault. 
 Honey, it wasn't your fault. I dropped it. 
 We'll stop and pick up something on the way. 
 Forget it. Just... 
 I don't want to forget it. 
 Things are tense enough already. 
 Let's not make it worse. 
 There's gonna be nowhere to park. 
 You guys run in, and I'll just circle. 
 Christy : Why is this so important to you? 
 After what I just went through, I-I just... 
 I want normal right now. 
 We'll find something. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, let me pull up here. 
 Come on. 
 I want to stay with dad. 
 Come here. 
 Get mom to keep it under 50 bucks, okay? 
 I'm on it. 
 All right. 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Insects chirping] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Where were you? 
 I had to take a leak. 
 Where's the girls? 
 They're waiting. 
 Let's go get them. 
 Did you find anything? 
 Yeah. Abby picked it out. 
 [Seat belt clicks] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 All right, girls, help us unpack, and then I'll go park. 
 Hey, guys. Coming down to help. 
 We've got it covered. 
 Hey, Uncle Michael! 
 Merry Christmas, Uncle Michael! 
 Looks amazing. 
 Michael : Slippery, guys. Be careful. 
 Natalie, just right upstairs. 
 Ben, how are you? 
 Getting better every day. 
 There should be another present, dad. 
 Well, that's all there is. 
 But I counted. There has to be one more. 
 Abby, go inside with your uncle. 
 Come on, now. Go. 
 Michael : Thank you. 
 Right behind you, sweetheart. 
 What's going on? 
 What? 
 I know you've been through an awful ordeal, but I am tired of walking on eggshells. 
 I didn't ask you to. 
 What were you doing in the woods? 
 I told you what I was doing. 
 You're lying to me. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Why would I lie about that? 
 I don't know, but Abby counted the presents before we left. 
 Now there's one missing. Explain that. 
 I can't. 
 What's in the backpack, Ben? 
 Christmas stuff. 
 If you're not gonna tell me, then Michael can drive us home later. 
 You should go. 
 Good idea. 
 
 
 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Engine revs] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Horn honking] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Tires squeal] 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Tires squeal] 
 [Engine revs] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Engine revs] 
 [Tires squeal] 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Siren chirps] 
 [Car door opens] 
 [Car door closes] 
 Man : Let me see your hands! 
 Eyes forward. 
 Why'd we pull you over? 
 I don't know, officer. I didn't do anything wrong. 
 Yeah, you did. Why'd we pull you over? 
 Cornell's daughter? 
 You don't screw with a cop's family. 
 Any more dumb-ass moves, and you could disappear. 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Water splashes] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Meet me at my house... now. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Ben : This was a direct threat! 
 It's proof that Cornell's abusing her badge! 
 Fenton : No, not even close. 
 You can't pick them out of a lineup, no plates. 
 You can't even describe their cars. 
 All right, what are we gonna do about Cornell? 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, the Goring article is gaining traction. 
 A.P. just picked it up. 
 Mm? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Thanks, partner. I'll talk to you soon. 
 Hey, man. 
 You know, you got a real skunk problem on your front porch. 
 Fenton's not my problem. I got him under control. 
 But if you don't stop breaking and entering... 
 I used the key that you gave me. 
 I knew you weren't gonna be here. 
 Where's the brood? 
 Still at Michael's. 
 How did the, uh, flashlight ditch go? 
 I wrapped it up like a gift and carried it out with the rest of the presents. 
 That's genius. 
 Out by the mall? 
 Ben : Yeah. 
 I don't feel good about it, but I put it back behind those thick trees, you know? 
 Okay. Good man. 
 Almost broke my leg on a shopping cart. 
 It's done. It's done. 
 And then Christy was standing there waiting when I came back. 
 So what? You were taking a leak, right? 
 That's what I said, but... 
 She doesn't know anything, right? 
 Does she know anything? 
 Ben? 
 [Knock on door] 
 You lying bitch. 
 You know, my mom felt sorry for you, and you screwed us. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You talked to the press about my dad, and now it's starting all over again. 
 I didn't screw you. 
 Now everybody knows your father was innocent and Cornell's responsible for his death. 
 No, she's not! 
 She ruined your family's lives! 
 No, my father was guilty, okay? 
 He raped that girl, and then he strangled her to death! 
 How do you know? 
 I found photos stashed in the basement. 
 And then I showed him the pictures. 
 And then he... 
 [Sighs] That's awful, man. 
 [Sniffles] 
 My mother didn't know that he was guilty, but now, with the article, the cops are gonna start digging again, and she... she... 
 [Footsteps approach] 
 Hey. What are you doing up so early? 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 Yesterday, uh... Your mom and... 
 You and mom had a fight. 
 One of many. 
 It made me think. 
 About what? 
 Most of my friends have problems with their mothers... with, um, makeup, boys, clothes... 
 Boys, s*x, boys. 
 Yeah, I have problems with those things, too. 
 Yeah. 
 But mom's easier to deal with. 
 I think she's trying too hard not to be like Nana. 
 You're on me about pretty much everything, and I hate it. 
 But I... 
 Also kind of know that I need that. 
 So what's the problem? 
 Well... 
 [Voice breaking] What do I do... 
 If you... Go away? 
 [Footsteps approach] 
 Where's Abby? 
 Abby : Why won't you leave my father alone?! 
 Cornell : Abby. 
 He didn't kill Tom! Why won't you believe him?! 
 Abby, I need you to calm down. 
 He didn't do anything wrong! 
 You're ruining everything! 
 Abby. Stop it! 
 It's all your fault! Why do you keep coming here? 
 It'd probably be best if you take your family inside. 
 He didn't do anything wrong! 
 Christy : Abby, stop. 
 We can't leave dad alone with her. 
 Honey, it's okay. You guys go in. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you. 
 Do you understand, Mr. Crawford? 
 Am I under arrest? 
 You can call an attorney and tell him where to meet us. 
 Where are we going? 
 [Indistinct conversations, police radio chatter] 
 [Car doors close] 
 Man : Mr. Crawford. This way. 
 Begin. 
 Man : All right, you heard her. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Why are we here? 
 You told me to call you as soon as I was arrested. 
 If you were, you'd be in cuffs. 
 It's called custodial interrogation. 
 A bush-league intimidation tactic, by the way. 
 It's only effective if you speak. 
 Did you? 
 No. 
 John, I still can't pay you. 
 I got a cashier's check for 25 grand with your name on it last week. 
 I don't have that kind of money. 
 All right, we'll deal with that later. 
 I still want to know why we're here. 
 Ask Cornell. 
 No, I'm asking you. 
 No cop brings a full crime-scene unit to the boonies for no reason. 
 All right, I stopped here last night with my family. 
 I went into the woods to take a leak. 
 End of story. 
 Cornell must be working off a tip that you threw away evidence. 
 Did anyone see you relieving yourself? 
 Just my wife. 
 I guess Christy called Cornell. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Communication between a husband and wife is privileged. 
 Cornell would never act on a bad lead. 
 Mr. Garner. 
 Detective, next time you want to fish, take a boat out on the Catawba and leave my client at home. 
 You're free to leave. 
 Meaning you found zip. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Man : Here they come. 
 Woman : I haven't seen them yet. 
 Hey, Linda! 
 Remember me from Arthur Fenton's house? 
 [Gasps] 
 It's not what you think. 
 What is it that I think? 
 The hell did you just do? 
 Walk with me. 
 I think I just plugged the leak in the crime lab. 
 You can explain it to me downtown. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Coming! 
 Yeah, I'll get a-a rough draft out to you this afternoon. 
 Hey. Look. 
 Looks like the story might be going national. 
 [Door closes] 
 A story  is  going national. 
 It's just not gonna be one you write. 
 What are you getting at, Ben? 
 You paid a lab rat for Tom's DNA results, then leaked them to the press. 
 I'm pretty sure that's illegal. 
 You'd know better than I would. 
 [Vehicles approach] 
 Wait. 
 Time's up. 
 [Car doors closing] 
 [Knock on door] 
 It's open. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Door closes] 
 Mr. Fenton. 
 You really have a thing for me, don't you? 
 You here to gloat, Mr. Crawford? 
 You compromised my lab and my cases... just to get back at me? 
 You have the right to remain silent. [Handcuffs clicking] 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 What were you doing in the woods? 
 This again? 
 Answer the question. 
 What are you hiding? 
 You don't trust me? 
 No, I don't. 
 You haven't given me much reason to in a long time. 
 I've tried to be patient. 
 My entire world has been turned upside down, and I've stood by you. 
 I've defended you time and time again. 
 To who? Your elitist family? 
 They already thought you married a loser. 
 Yeah, well, I didn't want them to be right. 
 It's always about money for you... money and and the way things look, keeping up appearances! 
 I wanted something more, something better. 
 All you want to do is coast. 
 No, all I wanted was you and the girls. 
 And I wanted a man who could keep up with me. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 Between your brother and your client, you got that covered. 
 Nothing happened with Sam until I found out about you and that whore across the street. 
 At least I own my mistakes. 
 You just look for excu... 
 Stop blaming me! 
 Your business failed. You gave up. 
 If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't even have a roof over our heads. 
 Our kids would have nothing. 
 But when I fix a problem, you resent me for it. 
 I'm tired of taking care of you. 
 So don't. I don't want it. 
 Tell me what's going on, or I am out of here. 
 That's the last ultimatum you give me. 
 Go. 
 Natalie! 
 Abby! 
 And here's what's gonna happen next. 
 You're gonna run to your brother, cry on his shoulder. 
 He'll give you a place to stay and tell you how much better off you are. 
 But you and I will agree on joint custody. 
 Girls, let's go. 
 Well, why are you fighting? 
 We're leaving. 
 Why? What's going on? 
 I said let's go. 
 Dad? Dad? 
 Abby : I don't want to go. 
 Guys. 
 What's going on? 
 Why aren't you telling me what's going on? 
 Abby, it's gonna be okay, honey. 
 Dad? 
 I don't want to go! [Sobbing] 
 Christy : Walk out the door. 
 Ben : It's gonna be okay. Take care of your sister. 
 And we're gonna figure this out. 
 Natalie, please help me. 
 It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all right. 
 I don't want to go! 
 I know, sweetheart. 
 Honey. 
 We're... we're gonna figure this out. 
 I don't want to go! We have to stay together! 
 It's gonna be all right. 
 [Sobbing] Don't let me go. 
 Abby, please come get in the car. 
 It's gonna be all right. 
 Abby : Why are we leaving? 
 It's just temporary, I promise you. 
 I don't want to go. 
 [Voice breaking] Go with your mom, just for tonight. 
 We're gonna figure this out. It's gonna be okay, all right? 
 You just got to be strong. 
 But what about Christmas? 
 We're gonna be together, I promise you. 
 Abby, come get in the car, honey. 
 Abby. 
 Why are you leaving dad alone?! 
 You don't care about anybody but yourself! 
 Okay. Okay, come on. Come on. 
 It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 [Panting] 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Car door closes] 
 Who the hell eats these things? 
 They're disgusting. 
 Is this why you called me to meet? 
 'Cause I got better things to do. 
 Like what? 
 That's what I thought. When I call, you come. 
 Now, walk with me. I'm late for dinner. 
 [Scoffs] You're a jackass. 
 You don't have to like me. 
 Just do what I say, and I'll keep you out of prison. 
 How's that? 
 It works. 
 Now, the cops who pulled you over without cause were not sent by Cornell, so let that go. 
 You sure? 
 I had a meeting at internal affairs. 
 A few cowboys wanted to shake your tree. 
 And, by the way, Cornell's daughter, she  is  a criminal. 
 Her father's a shrink. She stole his prescription pad. 
 She got pills from pharmacies all over the city and got his license suspended. 
 Well, so, what are you trying to say... 
 Cornell was right about her, so she's right about me? 
 Don't start with the innocence again. 
 No, man. I'm guilty... Of plenty. 
 Just not what I was accused of. 
 I've been harassed and yelled at and smeared and tortured. 
 I'm done getting pushed around. 
 Good. 
 It's about damn time. 
 I'll call you. 
 [Insects chirping] 
 [Car door opens] 
 [Car door closes] 
 I packed up some things, and I want the girls to have their gifts first thing tomorrow. 
 I'll put them under the tree. 
 Calling the cops on me was pretty low. 
 When my sister gets upset, I try to fix it. 
 She shared her suspicions with me, and I told the police. 
 Any honest citizen would've done the same thing, Ben. 
 You need to get a good lawyer. 
 I have one. 
 You know anything about that? 
 Good night. 
 [Rain falling] 
 [Switch clicking] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Don't you ever quit? 
 You're supposed to go through my lawyer. 
 Would you like to give him a call? 
 It's Christmas Eve. 
 Where's your family? 
 Where's yours? 
 [Liquid pouring] 
 You have a lot of people that care about you, Mr. Crawford. 
 Your kids are well-behaved... 
 Most of the time. 
 It would be a shame to lose that. 
 You would know. 
 My daughter had a choice. She chose jail. 
 I'm not gonna say it again. 
 What? 
 That you didn't kill Tom Murphy? 
 How can you be so sure? 
 Because I know my character. 
 I'm not violent. 
 Really? 
 I witnessed several instances of your violence... with your friend Dave, the video footage of the boy that you threatened to kill. 
 [Sighs] 
 So you didn't see Jess Murphy the night Tom died? 
 Nope. 
 And you didn't see Tom? 
 And you rode home alone in a taxi, correct? 
 We've been through all this. 
 I tracked down the driver, and we got the surveillance footage of his cab. 
 I already told you I was drunk. 
 Keep watching. 
 So you don't remember going to Jess Murphy's that night? 
 Either you're lying or you had a blackout, which means you're capable of just about anything. 
 Merry Christmas, Mr. Crawford. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes]
