 Previously on "Secrets And Lies"...  
 You're a murder suspect, Ben. 
 How do you think that's gonna look to a family-court judge? 
 You're really gonna use our kids to get your revenge? 
 That $25,000 that paid for my retainer came straight from the missus. 
 Your wife is hiding cash. 
 Ben : Dave and I retraced our steps. 
 It all came back when I saw Tom's trike in the driveway. 
 I wanted to warn Jess. 
 About what? 
 Christy. 
 That was the night she found out about me and Jess. 
 Tom woke up, so I walked him back to bed. 
 You were the last person to see Tom Murphy alive. 
 No. That would be his killer. 
 [Door opens] 
 Is that my blood-spatter report? 
 No. 
 It's just the transcript from your meeting with Crawford and his lawyer. 
 [Sighs] 
 You got something new? 
 Ben Crawford came in voluntarily and placed himself in the victim's house, said he read the boy a bedtime story. 
 That's good. 
 Makes him the last known person to see the kid alive. 
 Even if Crawford didn't know any better, why would his lawyer let him do that? 
 Bad-guys manual. 
 Makes him look like he's cooperating. 
 All that matters is, he killed Tom Murphy. 
 The problem is, I don't think Crawford killed  anyone. 
 You're looking for something? 
 Where'd you get the money, Christy? 
 Michael. 
 He just gave you 150 grand? 
 Over a number of years. 
 [Chuckling] "Over a number of years." 
 This just gets better and better. 
 He was trying to help. 
 By getting you to lie to me? 
 He's a hell of a guy. 
 He was worried about us, Ben... about our future. 
 Right, 'cause you married  me. 
 It was just a cushion. 
 $150,000 is not a cushion. It's an escape plan. 
 So you could take the girls and leave me. 
 That wasn't the plan  before,  but it's a great idea... especially when you consider custody. 
 Give me my money, Ben. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I guess we could make a deal. 
 I have your money. You have my children. 
 Funny. 
 I will end up with both. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 Nothing. It's fine. 
 [Grunts] 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 [Lock clicks] 
 Jess asked me to clear out Tom's room. 
 She just [Sighs] can't. 
 Hey, do you still have Jess' house key? 
 We should really get that back. 
 I don't know where Nat keeps it, but I'll take a look. 
 I keep telling Jess to change the locks, but she won't. 
 She says she doesn't care. 
 Is she okay? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Yeah. 
 She'd be a lot better if she took her meds. 
 Yeah, she said she doesn't like the sedatives... 
 The ones the doctors gave her after Tom died. 
 You really don't know my sister at all. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Ahhhhhh. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Ooh, yeah. That smells good. 
 It's kind of beautiful, brother. 
 I just want to eat it. 
 150 grand. 
 Wow. 
 I just want to pour it into the tub and then take a naked money bath. 
 You'd need a lot more than 150... 
 Hey. 
 Garner wants to float Christy as an alternate suspect. 
 If it saves your bacon, bro, why not? 
 Because she's the mother of my children. 
 Yeah. She also hid a bazillion dollars in your house, man. 
 I say fair game. 
 Besides, she's prob... 
 Boop. 
 Finish that. What? 
 Hmm? I won't say anything. 
 Come on, man. What? 
 [Sighs] 
 I know how this goes down, all right? 
 I'm not getting caught in this trap. 
 You obviously want to say something. 
 Say it. 
 Come on, Dave. 
 I know how this works, okay? 
 I trash Christy tonight, you get back with her tomorrow. 
 We're not getting back together. 
 Our marriage is over. 
 Okay, just... 
 Just remember that you  made  me say this. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, don't you think that it's a little weird that Christy was  so  eager to help out Andrea with the investigation? 
 "Andrea" now? 
 It was a very expensive meal. 
 Look, the fact is that Christy basically told her exactly where to find the flashlight. 
 She told  Michael. 
 Who she knew would go straight to the cops. 
 Plus, the same night that you talked to her about Jess, that is the same night that Tommy ended up dead. 
 Wait, man. 
 Y-y-you can't seriously think that Christy... 
 A woman scorned, brother. 
 She's a lot of things, but she wouldn't hurt Tom. 
 Yeah, you didn't think she'd hide money in your house, either... 
 Take the kids... 
 Do the hokey pokey with a client. 
 Come on. 
 Then why'd she put the flashlight back in my truck? 
 To frame you. 
 And after she framed me, why did she pay my lawyer 25 grand? 
 Image is everything to her, man. 
 I'm sorry. 
 So she pays off Garner to look like the devoted martyr who would stick with her husband no matter what. 
 [Sighs] 
 I know it's messed up. It's messed up. 
 But you can't ignore the facts here. 
 Tommy's dead, and Christy had the motive  and  the opportunity. 
 You bellowed? 
 I need hard evidence to make an arrest. 
 Tom Murphy was attacked with a flashlight. 
 Where is my spatter analysis? 
 In the lab, waiting be reprocessed. 
 You got extra personnel and equipment to help you fix what Linda Freeman broke. 
 What's the holdup? 
 I get my marching orders from the inspector general. 
 He tells me what's important. 
 I've already reconfirmed the make and model of the flashlight, as well as the brand and the item number of the killer's blue jacket. 
 You're welcome. 
 How long is it gonna be? 
 How about this? 
 I'll call you when I'm done. 
 [Door opens] 
 Dad? 
 [Chuckling] Hey. 
 How'd you guys get here? 
 Hey, dad. 
 Hey, hon. 
 Is your mother here? 
 Uncle Michael brought us to get more clothes. 
 Mom's out somewhere. 
 With Sam. I think he's her boyfriend. 
 Shut up, Abby. 
 He's been around like twice. 
 He's a tool. 
 It's okay. 
 No, it's not. 
 If you and mom split up, what are we gonna do? 
 W-where are we gonna live? 
 We'll figure it out. 
 It's not something you should have to worry about. 
 You'll have two homes with no fighting. I promise. 
 Are you gonna be with Jess? 
 What? No. 
 Abby, where did you hear that? 
 Uncle Michael. 
 He said you love her. 
 [Sighs] 
 I... Like Jess. We  all  do. 
 She's our neighbor, and she's going through a tough time. 
 I... 
 We get it. 
 Come on, Abby. Let's get our stuff. 
 Hey, man, you don't have to respect me. 
 But if you badmouth me to my girls again, we're gonna have a problem. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Jess. 
 Stop putting ideas in their heads. 
 We're not together. Got it? 
 [Sighing] Oh, boy. 
 Yeah, they must have overheard. 
 You know, Michael, I really thought you loved my girls. 
 After everything they've been through, why would you want to hurt them more? 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Door opens] 
 It won't happen again. 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey, girls. 
 You ready? 
 Natalie : Yep. 
 [Trunk lid opens] 
 Thank you. 
 Abby? 
 I'm not going. 
 We didn't get Christmas. 
 Can we at least go to the fireworks, like we do every year? 
 I know it's hard, hon. 
 Abby, go to the fireworks. 
 Make a night of it. 
 Yes! 
 All right, just, uh, tell Christy I'll bring the girls back after. 
 Won't be a problem. 
 I'll pass. None of my friends will be there anyway. 
 Come on. 
 Abby needs you, dad. 
 [Car door closes] 
 Have a good time. 
 Guess it's just you and me. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 I'm excited. 
 Here it is. 
 I didn't get to see you, so... 
 Merry Christmas, dad. 
 I wrapped it myself. 
 You did. Better than  I  can do. 
 The best part is tearing it open. 
 I don't want to mess it up. 
 [Paper rustles] 
 Thank you, Abby. 
 I love it. 
 You can add more photos whenever you want. 
 I don't want you to be alone. 
 Sweetie, I'm not alone. 
 I have you and Nat. 
 Honey, I'm so sorry about all this. 
 But you have to remember ... No matter what, your mother and I both love you very much. 
 I know that. 
 It means you don't have to pick sides or play favorites. 
 I can't help it. I'm a daddy's girl. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is that okay? 
 Come here. 
 Why are we here again? 
 I'm starting over. 
 I got a backlog of evidence to process. 
 [Water rushing] 
 If I'm right, we'll have more soon. 
 I need an evidence marker. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Camera clicks] 
 [Camera clicks] 
 It's been weeks. That could be anyone's toy. 
 And this could be anyone's job. 
 I want you to spray this whole area down. 
 The crime scene is back there. 
 Wasn't supposed to be. 
 All right. 
 Tom's killer wanted to get him down to the river so he'd drown. 
 The boy couldn't swim. 
 Whoa. 
 He tried to run away, and that's why he got hit. 
 The first blow happened here, and then she chased him back there, where he died. 
 "She"? 
 Water killing is a  female's  M.O. 
 I thought you were looking at Ben Crawford. 
 Not anymore. 
 Tom's killer is female. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 [Lock clicks] 
 [Car door opens] 
 [Car door closes] 
 What you got there, monk? 
 [Engine sputters] 
 Are you hiding something? 
 Mom said not to show you. 
 She said you'd be mad 'cause it's just from her. 
 [Engine sputters] 
 Don't hide anything from me... ever. 
 But I  am  jealous. 
 Better phone than mine. 
 [Chuckles] [Engine sputters] 
 So, put my number in there. 
 [Car door opens, closes] 
 Jess : Hey. 
 My car won't start. 
 Where you headed? You need a lift? 
 To the fireworks. 
 Us too. 
 You were gonna go alone? 
 Well, I used to take Tom every year. 
 It was our tradition. 
 He loved how loud it got. 
 [Chuckles] She used to hate the noise. 
 You remember? 
 You'd make us take you, and then you'd cry the whole time. 
 Dad. 
 I know... you love it now. 
 And I don't want to miss it, so can we go? 
 Well, you sure this is okay... me coming along? 
 Why would you want to go anywhere that reminds you of Tom? 
 Abby. 
 I just mean... 
 Doesn't it make you sad? 
 Actually, it's nice remembering things that made him happy. 
 Let's go. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Abby : How many tickets do we have left? 
 Ben : Enough for a ride or some games. 
 What do you want? 
 Remember when I made Nat take me on this? 
 Right before you threw up your cotton candy all over her? 
 That time? [Laughs] 
 Good times. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [People screaming] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Bell clangs] 
 Should we  all  go on? 
 With her? 
 I know... tonight's  our  night, Abby, but she's sad and lonely. 
 Tom's gone. 
 Jess? Can you take our picture? 
 It's all ready. Just snap. 
 Okay, got it. 
 Thanks for being such a good sport. 
 Ready? 
 Go on, step on in, dear. 
 Let me take a picture of the whole family. 
 Oh. Okay, thanks. There you are. 
 We're  not  a family. 
 Come on, dad. Let's go find the games. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll catch you later. 
 [Bell rings] 
 Ben : They won't stop! 
 Got it! 
 Which one did you get? 
 That guy down there is gonna beat you. 
 [Bell dinging] 
 Congratulations, little lady. 
 Winner gets to pick a prize! 
 Nice, monkey! [Laughs] 
 Winner! 
 She's having a good time. 
 Yeah. 
 The split's been tough on her. 
 So has everything else. 
 How are  you  doing? 
 It's hard to be happy. 
 But this place is helping. 
 Thanks for letting me tag along. 
 What's wrong? 
 What? 
 This is gonna sound crazy, but I-I-I thought I saw Cornell over there. 
 Here? 
 On the other side of that ride, yeah. 
 I doubt she'd risk coming here. 
 I mean, that actually means she'd have fun. 
 Dad? Can we get kettle corn? 
 "Can we get kettle corn?" 
 You know the answer. 
 We'll wait right here for you, okay? 
 Okay. 
 You know, I apologized to Christy, but not to  you. 
 Jess, I was there, too. 
 I guess I just feel more guilty 'cause... 
 I don't regret it. 
 Because of our mistake, I mean, I had five beautiful years with Tom. 
 You gave me that. 
 And I'm always gonna be grateful for that. 
 [Abby screams] 
 Abby! Abby, what's wrong?! 
 What happened, hon? 
 [Sobbing] 
 Honey, it's okay. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Can we fix it? 
 It's dead, monk. 
 Mom's gonna be so mad. 
 What do I do? 
 Tell her the truth. 
 She'll be angry you didn't take care of your phone, but she'll get over it. 
 You know that. 
 [Sighs] It's my fault. 
 I have to take responsibility. 
 Yes, you do. 
 You got to face the music. And so will I if I don't get you home soon. 
 I don't want to go to Uncle Michael's house. I don't like it there. 
 You used to love it. He has all the games and movies and a big flat-screen. 
 [Voice breaking] It's not home. I want to sleep in my own bed. 
 Please. 
 You just got to be patient, sweetie. 
 That's all I can tell you. 
 It's all right. 
 
 
 
 Jess : Hey, are you okay, Abby? 
 I got you the kettle corn. 
 Let's just go. 
 Sam : Trust me... that's the last time I got roped into a bachelor auction. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Detective Cornell. 
 I'm sorry to interrupt. 
 This is Sam Morrison. 
 Hello. 
 It's a pricy Bordeaux. 
 I like it. 
 You treat yourself well, Mr. Morrison. 
 Three houses, two cars, lots of trips overseas. 
 W-why are you checking up on  me? 
 I'm not in the middle of whatever this is. 
 Oh, that's not accurate. 
 You were with Mrs. Crawford the night Tom Murphy got killed. 
 What are you implying? 
 I told you Sam was a good friend who gave me a shoulder to cry on. 
 Right. 
 After you found out that your husband had slept with Jess Murphy. 
 That must have been so hard to hear. 
 I had my suspicions. 
 So, you left the house, and you went to the Kwik Mart, and then Mr. Morrison offered you comfort. 
 I listened. 
 Christy's been in absolute hell. 
 Her husband's a liar. 
 If you ask me, the guy's an ass. 
 I'd rather ask you what time Mrs. Crawford left your house. 
 I left... 
 Twelve thirty. 
 It was half past, detective. 
 Mm. 
 Anything else? 
 I know where to find you if I need you. 
 Thank you. 
 Sam. 
 I'm not doing this. 
 People do show their true colors when they're under pressure. 
 What time did you come home the night Tom was killed? 
 Isn't that Detective Cornell's car? 
 Yeah. What's she doing here? 
 That's mom's boy... 
 Sam. 
 He's mom's friend. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 I'll be back. 
 Can you talk to mom so we can all come home? 
 Your mother and I can't live together anymore. 
 Well... 
 Can you ask her if I can come live with  you? 
 I'll help take care of you, dad. 
 I can do stuff around the house. You'll see. 
 It's not that simple. 
 Don't you want me? 
 Of course I do. 
 But a girl needs her mother... especially a  teenage  girl. 
 You want to be with Jess. 
 You love her. 
 Abby, we talked about this. I love you and Nat. 
 Jess is just a friend. 
 Mom says the same thing about Sam, but I saw her kiss him. 
 Please, dad. 
 I want to live with  you. 
 I want that, too, sweetheart, believe me. 
 But ... 
 Mom's right... you're a liar. 
 You say you love us but you just want to be with Jess. 
 [Door slams] 
 [Sighs] 
 Christy : This is ridiculous. 
 I had nothing to do with Tom's death. 
 I'm not accusing you, Mrs. Crawford. 
 If this is what you did to Ben, no wonder he went nuts. 
 Your husband went and slept with a neighbor. 
 I've seen women commit murder for less than what you've been through. 
 You argued. 
 Didn't you say, "Jess and Tom must go"? 
 Did you say that? 
 [Door opens] 
 That's not what she said! 
 You're getting it all wrong! 
 What  did  your mother say, Abby? 
 She said she'd take us if dad didn't go away. 
 You heard the fight? 
 Everyone  heard the fight, mom. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Yeah, you're sorry. 
 You guys can't keep doing this. Abby's just a kid. 
 [Door closes] 
 Sweetheart, come here. 
 Come here. 
 We've had enough. 
 [Voice breaking] I'm really sorry, hon. 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 You okay? 
 There's just too much quiet. 
 I know what you mean. 
 I'll walk you home. 
 You don't have to do that. I'll be fine. 
 [Car door closes] 
 You want to talk or... ? 
 Forget it. I'm sorr... 
 No. 
 I'd  love  some company.

 Good morning. 
 Mm. 
 Last night was insane. 
 Good or bad? 
 Great. 
 But it wasn't as good as last time. 
 Hey. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I didn't mean it like that. 
 It's just... 
 [Sighs] 
 Last time, we made Tom. 
 I can't imagine how hard that's been for you. 
 Tom was such a great kid. 
 We could make another. 
 What? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Um... That was... 
 I shouldn't have said that. Just ignore that I said that. 
 Um... 
 I just miss Tom so much lately, I don't know what I'm saying, so if you could just rewind... 
 It's okay. Don't worry about it. 
 I'm gonna jump in the shower. 
 [Shower water running] 
 [Thud] 
 [Shower water running] 
 [Water shuts off] 
 You're dressed. 
 Yep. 
 Well, I was kind of, sort of hoping you'd join me. 
 Uh... can I get a rain check? 
 [Moaning] 
 Or we could... [chuckles] 
 Yeah, I just, um, I-I got a ton to do this morning. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. I'm sorry. 
 No, no, no. But m-m-maybe we can make it up later. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Maybe I can make something for dinner. 
 That sounds great. 
 I'm not ready for you yet. 
 Just give me what you have so far. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 The clock is ticking. 
 And this is new evidence I found for you. 
 So let me process it... for  you. 
 When can I have my results? 
 When I'm done. 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 What is it? 
 Abby : Daddy? 
 Hey, monkey. 
 What's up? 
 I'm sorry I yelled at you. 
 I'm sorry, too. 
 I asked mom if we could come home. 
 She said no. 
 Oh, it's okay. W-we're gonna figure it out, all right? 
 Okay. 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey, sweetie, do you know where Nat kept the key to Jess' house? 
 Why? 
 Well, we don't need it anymore, and, uh, Jess' sister asked for it back. 
 I don't know. Maybe in the kitchen. 
 Yeah? 
 This place is boring. It's not fun. 
 There's nothing to do here. 
 Uncle Michael keeps trying to teach me how to play chess. 
 Well, chess is a good game to know. 
 I don't want to play chess. 
 It's like joining the math club. 
 Yeah, I don't blame you. Chess is boring. 
 Um... Is it okay if I give you a call back a little later? 
 Okay. 
 All right. I love you. 
 [Click, dial tone] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Jess : Put that down. 
 Jess, what happened to Jane? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I know about the pills. 
 I know that you're not taking them. 
 That blue jacket's yours. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Jess, your baby is dead. 
 What are the odds of having two dead kids? 
 Get out of my house. 
 What happened to them both? 
 What happened to them? 
 What did you do to them? 
 I loved my kids! 
 Get out! 
 I hate you! 
 You don't know what it's like to lose a child! 
 I loved Tom, too! 
 You still have yours! 
 [Panting] 
 [Lock clicks] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Ringing] 
 Dave : Speak. 
 911, man. 
 What is your emergency, sir? 
 I think I got, like, a "fatal attraction" thing happening with Jess Murphy. 
 What?! 
 Hold on. You hit that  again? 
 That's not the issue. H-her being crazy is the issue. 
 Yeah. No. Wait. Um, who's the crazy one, Ben? 
 She  is. Seriously. 
 She needs medication. 
 I saw a picture of her wearing the blue jacket. 
 Uh,  the  blue jacket? That's crazy. 
 What are you going to do? 
 This time, I'm gonna find it. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Did we learn  nothing  from pointing fingers at people, Benjamin? 
 That's why... 
 I'm gonna go talk to her sister first. 
 Well, Nicole should be at yoga. 
 Her ashtanga class starts in 20 minutes. 
 How... how the hell would you know that? 
 The, uh, the zen yoga is right across from the cold stone. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Ben? 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 [Relaxing music plays] 
 What do you want, Ben? I have a class. 
 I want to know what happened to Jane. 
 She told you about her? 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 How did she die? 
 Sudden infant death syndrome. 
 It happens sometimes. Babies just die for no reason. 
 SIDS? 
 Jess fell apart. 
 Scott had to commit her for 72 hours so she wouldn't hurt herself. 
 Was she taking these at the time? 
 Go home, Ben. 
 You said that I didn't know her, so what am I missing? 
 Jess is bipolar and goes off her meds and happens to have two dead children? 
 Jess didn't kill anybody. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 She has got  hundreds  of these stashed away. 
 Yeah, because when Jess takes her meds, she's great. 
 She's so good that she feels like she doesn't need them anymore. 
 Yeah, well, she's not on them now. 
 How violent does she get? 
 It's not what you think. 
 When Jess loses control, she has fits. 
 She destroys  things,  not people. 
 Scott couldn't take her ups and downs anymore. 
 That's why he left. 
 Jess showed me a video. She said Scott destroyed the house. 
 It was  her,  wasn't it? 
 She has outbursts. 
 I've been dealing with it since we were teenagers. 
 But there's no way that she killed Tom. 
 She loved him more than anything. 
 Did you tell Cornell any of this? 
 She's my sister. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Hello? 
 I-is she there? 
 Who? 
 Abby. 
 Is Abby with you? 
 What? No. 
 [Sobbing] Oh, God. 
 Christy, what's going on? 
 She was in her room. 
 I went in to check on her, and... and I thought maybe she snuck out to see you. 
 All right, I'm headed home now. 
 How long has she been gone? 
 I've looked everywhere, Ben. 
 She's... she's gone. 
 [Engine revs] 
 Abby?! 
 Abby?! 
 Abby?! 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 John Patrick called. He has results for you. 
 Abby?! 
 Abby?! 
 Abby?! 
 [Panting] 
 Elaine! Elaine! 
 Elaine, have you seen Abby? 
 No. What's going on? 
 She's missing. 
 Happy New Year, Andrea. 
 How long's she been gone? 
 [Gasps] I don't know. 
 Call Detective Cornell. 
 [Door slams] 
 [Doorknob rattles] 
 Do you have Abby in there?! 
 You lost your daughter now? 
 Feels horrible, doesn't it? 
 If you hurt her, I'll kill you! 
 [Sighs] 
 I was right. 
 It was  her. 
 She killed Tom Murphy.
