 Previously on "Secrets And Lies"... 
 Did you know that Tom was my son? 
 No. 
 Jess, I would never hurt Tom. 
 I know who did it. 
 I am not gonna let you take my son! 
 I was scared of my own husband. 
 Scott! Let him go! 
 I don't care what the test says. 
 That was my boy. 
 DNA sample submitted by Ben Crawford revealed that he is the boy's biological father. 
 I didn't know. 
 It's marvelous what forensics can tell us. 
 We've determined the make and model of the flashlight used to murder your son. 
 And if you don't go to prison, I'm gonna kill you. 
 ♪ You can say there's no such thing as Santa  ♪ 
♪  But as for me and grandpa...  ♪ 
 Dave : It's a bad idea, man. 
 You didn't wake up with Scott in your family room threatening to kill you. 
 Listen, I-I grew up with guns, okay? 
 My pops had guns. 
 Guns are not the answer. 
 Although that... that's totally baller right there. 
 Dave, he came into my house. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Listen, when I was a little kid, I was terrified of the boogeyman, and it got really bad. 
 And I said, "I'm gonna take justice into my own hands." 
 So I go outside of my window with a baseball bat, in the bushes, and I figure I'm gonna catch the boogeyman in the act. 
 No. 
 My pops wakes up, he sees somebody outside, he almost blows my head off with a 12-gauge. 
 You get it? 
 Stupidity is genetic? 
 No. 
 If you  fear  the boogeyman, you  become  the boogeyman. 
 You dig it? It's deep, right? 
 Yeah. I have a family. 
 You don't. You can't understand. 
 What you looking for? 
 I need a .45 for home defense. 
 Got a nice used Glock 21. 
 I'm just saying that maybe we'd all feel a lot safer if you left the whole Scotty-search thing to the cops. 
 As long as Scott is free, my family isn't safe. 
 Cornell's so convinced that I killed Tom, she's not even looking for him. 
 Well, how are  you  gonna find him? 
 Scott knew the DNA results before they leaked. 
 Jess would never tell him, so she had to tell somebody. 
 And whoever it is, they know where Scott is. 
 Man : Crawford. 
 Can I help you? 
 Hope you're buying that gun to kill yourself. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 This  was  a bad idea. 
 [indistinct conversation] 
 Right here's good. 
 Reporter :  The law was designed to help... 
 Hey, dad. 
 Hey, monkey. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 The councilman refused to comment on the new ordinance. 
 We will now cut live to our very own Channel 7 field reporter, who is outside the home of Ben Crawford, who appears to be a suspect in the murder... Dave's on TV! ... Of 5-year-old Tom Murphy. It was recently revealed that Crawford was Murphy's biological father. All right, all right, all right, all right. All right, I'll make a statement. I'll make a statement. Please don't. I'm only gonna say this once. I'm gonna be very clear about this. I did not have... [As Bill Clinton]  Sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. Man :  Tell us anything legitimate about what happened? Thank you! Good night! Who's "Lou Inski"? It's an old friend of Dave's. Why do they think Dave had sexual relations with his wife? No, they said "special relation." Hey. Hey, Nat. How was your day? Great. I loved explaining to my friends that the dead boy I used to babysit is my dad's illegitimate love child. Hey! What are you doing? It's makeup, you idiot! I'm only using a little. Ben : Girls, stop it! Stop! Stop! Hey, girls, stop it! Stop. No, you're not. Didn't buy it for her stupid collage. Don't talk to your sister like that. She's a thief and you yell at me? Abby : She bought it for Cooper's party. It's Friday night. She's been eavesdropping again. [Door opens, closes] What are you gonna do about that? All right, we have talked about respecting your sister's privacy. I'm sorry for not respecting your privacy, Natalie. That's it? What's this party? [Sighs] It's no big deal. Cooper's brother's turning 21 and having some friends over. Uh-huh. You're 16. You don't trust me? When you hide things from us, it makes it a little difficult to trust you. You hate Cooper. You'd say no. I don't hate Cooper. You don't? So I can go? No. It's not age-appropriate. Come on, man. Cut her some slack. You can parent your teenagers when they find you. Mom, all of my friends are gonna be there. Your father said no. You have our answer. What?! I'm practically an adult. You really want to have a conversation about being an adult? [Door opens] You look nice. [Door closes] What? Where you going? Company Christmas thing. Beautiful earrings. They new? Gift from a client. Expensive. I guess. Christy, I'm sorry. For knocking up Jess or letting me find out on TV? Christy... Reporter : Mrs. Crawford, how did you feel when you found out your husband was Tom's father? Are they still sleeping together? Ben, does Scott know you're Tom's dad? Ben, did you know Tom was your son? Mr. Crawford, have you spoken to... [Reporters shouting indistinctly] [Engine turns over] Mr. Crawford, have you spoken to Detective Cornell? Give us a statement. Please, anything. Mrs. Crawford! What are you doing? Just trying to avoid the cameras. They've been thirsty ever since they found out about the DNA. Yeah. I'm sorry that the news broke out on TV. Is Christy okay? How are you? I'm fine. And sometimes... Sometimes, I'm not. When I wake up in the morning and... just for a second, I forget. And Tom's alive and he's happy. Then I remember. You know, the doctors prescribed me pain killers, but I just... I hate pills. Have you heard from Scott? No. He knew before it leaked. He knew Tom was my son. I didn't tell anyone. The only person that I told was my sister. [Cellphone beeps] It doesn't even ring. It goes straight to voice-mail. I don't understand. I mean, Nicole got all her classes covered so she could be around for me. There's no way that she doesn't pick up my phone call. Something has to be wrong. [ "A place to bury strangers' worship" playing ] [ Volume increases ] ♪ I'm gonna take you  ♪ Jess : Scott? [Exhales sharply] No! Don't. Don't, Jess. [Siren wails] [Police radio chatter] All right. That's... that's all for now. Yes, ma'am. All right, this way. Let them know we're en route. What did Scott say? Did he admit that he killed Tom? I'm sorry, Mrs. Murphy, I can't disclose that. But as soon as I have something to tell you, I will. You have my word. Go on home. You're welcome. I didn't say thank you, Mr. Crawford. You should. I found Scott. Are you aware that 75% of child killers inject themselves into the investigation? [Police radio chatter] [Car door opens, closes] [Engine turns over] [Siren wails] [Ring clatters] Hey. Hi. Where have you been? We found Scott. "We"? I'm tired. I need to go to bed. [Birds chirping] [Sighing] [Sighing] [Indistinct conversation] [Door hinges creak] Good morning. What's going on? Uh, she wanted to file an appeal about the party. It was rejected. Listen, I promised Abby I would take her Christmas shopping after school, but I have a house to show. So can you...? That's fine. I'll do it. Well, thanks. [Sighs] You found Scott. It's done. So you can stop investigating, right? Okay. Abby : Can we hang lights like these on our house this year? With everything that's going on, I'm not sure if that's a good idea, monkey. The neighbors put up lights. Yeah, but they put them up before Tom died and before all those reporters were camped out. If we hang them now, people might think we're not sad about Tom. But you always say I shouldn't care what other people think. Well, this is different. 'Cause the whole neighborhood's grieving. I'm sad. I'm sure you are, too. But I kind of don't know how to feel. I mean, he was Tom from across the street, but he was also my brother. It's confusing. I have an idea. What if we hung lights  inside  the house? That could be cool. Can I pick them out? Yeah. There you go. [Woman laughs] [Indistinct conversations] [Sighs] Santa: Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ho, ho, ho! [Distorted] Merry Christmas! Come on. Hold my hand. Let's go tell Santa what you want for Christmas. Mom. All this from the girl who made us wait in line twice 'cause she couldn't remember which doll she wanted. Tom! [Camera shutter clicks] Wait, Tom! Ben : Whoa! What's going on? [Scoffs] I thought he was excited to come see Santa. I don't know. Give me a minute. Santa : Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Hey, buddy. You don't want to let your mom know you're scared, huh? Dad's not afraid of anything. No, he's not. Your dad fights real bad guys. Dudes way scarier than Santa. But I'll tell you a secret. You ready? Dads and sons are the same. Made from the same parts and the same pieces. So that means you have your dad's courage right in there. You just don't know it 'cause you haven't tried it out on something you're super scared of, but you have it. I promise. Feel it? Is it in there? Yeah? Go get 'em. Girl : Cheese! You ready to go see Santa? [Woman laughs] Thanks, Santa! I want to see the picture, mom! [Footsteps approach] I got the snowball and candy-cane ones. That's great. Let's go home and put them up. ♪It's Christmas time ♪ Ben : Nat, mom'll be home soon, so if you want to change before the fair, you probably... Okay, I found one. This is so hurting me. Here. Grab that. I didn't even put it in yet. Okay. Here? Is that good? No, no, no, no, no, no. Further. Oh, man. Here? Yeah. Further. Further. Keep it coming. Come on. He's gonna fall. Further than that? Yep. It needs to be further. It's right over the thing there. Come on. Keep it coming. Oh, my God. [Groans] Oh, God! [Laughs] [Chuckles] I'm going to kill you. [Laughing] Ooh! Oh! [Laughter] Get down! [Laughs] Can I get a ladder, please? [Sighs] Yes. [Clears throat] [Laughing] Abby, don't... don't grow up to be like this one. [Indistinct talking] [Footsteps approach] Christy : Ben? You ready? We have to go. Uh, just give me two minutes. [Lock clicks] [Sighs] Here you go. [Indistinct talking] Mom, I'm gonna go. Why don't we stay together for a little bit? Mom? Go on. [Scoffs] Still giving you the silent treatment? She's going for the record. Yeah, well, she has to accept the fact that her parents are people who make mistakes, just like everyone else. Yeah, right. Daddy, can I get some cotton candy? Yeah. Sure. Here. Mm. You see it? Come on. It's happening. Yeah, well, we're not gonna hide. [Camera shutter clicks] Uh... oh... Aah! You okay? I want cider. Do you see Lisa? Lisa! He's right here. Oh! It's okay. I can't take my eyes off him for one second. Blue wall cider. Oh, of course. Of course. The cider stand's usually by the blue wall. Ohh. Well, that's why he got lost. Would you like to take me for cider, Matty? Yeah, why don't you do that, Matty? Let's go. There you go. I'll be back. Oh, thank you. Man, that kid likes his cider, huh? The singles scene is dead. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Ooh. I spoke too soon. There's a hottie with a body at your 10. Oh, I know her. You know her?! Yeah, her name's Allison. She's in Natalie's class. She's 16. [Inhales deeply] I'm going to hell. Christy : The Richardsons are here. I'm gonna get a snack. Let's go say hi. [Ben sighs] Ignore him. Hey, Ben, why don't you come and join us over here? Hey, Joe. Good to see you out. Nice to see you again, Christy. We were just leaving. Going so soon, Kev? [Sighs] Christy, Ben, it's so good to see you both. Happy holidays. You, too. Happy holidays. Bye. 
 
 Vanessa : I wouldn't take it personally. That man's just naturally anti-social. I suppose. It's all right. I'm used to it. Craig : Ow! Abby : That's not true! Take it back! Ow! You hurt me! You're a liar! Take it back! Did not! Take it back! Abby : That's not true! Abby! It's not my fault. What happened? Craig's a liar. We... we were just kidding around, and then she went all crazy and pushed me. You can't just go around hitting people, young lady. Thanks, man. I'll... I'll deal with my daughter. What happened? Did you push him? He called you a "baby killer." That's not okay. Craig, you apologize to Abby right now. But you said it... Now. I'm sorry. Abby. Dad... I'm sorry. You shouldn't say things like that. I don't know where he heard it. Go. [Sighs] Let's go. [Crickets chirping] [Panting] [Birds chirping] [Breathing heavily] [Insects chirping] [Indistinct conversation] I know exactly... What's going on? Um, Detective Cornell wants a receipt from the flashlight I bought you, but the files are in the cabinet and it's locked. Isn't Scott Murphy in custody? I'm not at liberty to share the details of the case with you. Ben, she said the receipt could help eliminate you as a suspect. If the model of your flashlight is different than the one forensics indicates was the murder weapon, then you're off the hook. Don't you need a search warrant? Only if you're unwilling to cooperate. The problem is, if I come back here with a warrant and CSIs and detectives, the press is just gonna film the whole thing. And no matter how I try to protect you, they're not gonna listen. Those hyenas will just keep rolling and let the picture tell the story. We appreciate you taking all that into consideration. Ben, do you know where the key is? Yeah. It's right here. [Sighs] Here we go. You okay, Mr. Crawford? You're sweating. Yeah, I just came back from a run. It's nice you can keep up with your routine. Most people wouldn't. Christy : I know it's in here somewhere. Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time. I can do that for you if it's easier. Thank you. Christy : No, I have no clue what you're talking about. Please. Every time I turn my back, you're helping that woman try to put me away. Have you lost your mind? She thinks I killed Tom! You understand?! But you didn't. You're innocent. The more we cooperate, the sooner she's gonna see that. [Sighs] That's so naive. There are countless stories of innocent men being exonerated decades after being in prison, sometimes after they were executed! She is a homicide detective. She's looking at every possible angle to solve Tom's murder. He was your son. I would think you would feel some responsibility to help her. That wasn't fair. What is? [Sighs] Christy, I've screwed up... A lot. But I need you to stand by me on this, and if you won't do it for me, then can you please do it for our girls? Yes, of course. I am. And I will. I'm late. I have to go. [Door closes] [Cellphone rings] [Cellphone beeps] Ben Crawford. Fenton : Mr. Crawford, I've got a job for you. Really? Yeah. You available in the near future? Yes, I'm available. I'll try not to get underfoot, but I work at home, so I'm here. Ben : What kind of work do you do? I'm a researcher. I used to be on staff at one of those big, established firms, but that went away, so... Now job to job. I know how that is. Yeah. And, man, it must be tough getting work with your face all over the news. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm real grateful you weren't scared off, so... Believe me, I get it. You know, when we were getting divorced, my ex... she suddenly remembered that I sexually assaulted her. Mm. Yeah. One of those nightmare custody fights you hear about. I'm sorry. Yeah. I found out right then how fast people rush to judgment. It's like I woke up one day and suddenly, I was the bad guy. You know? It's pretty surreal. Yeah. Bad as it is for me, I can't imagine how terrible it was for you to find that little boy out there. That must have been awful for you. [Breathing heavily] Oh, I'm sorry. I-I wasn't thinking. Hey, let me help you down. I'm all right, man. Y-you hear so much about a s-story in the news, and you forget that real people are involved. I just have to go pick up my daughter. Right. Of course. A-and I'm sorry... again. [Thunder crashes] [Breathing deeply] [Breathing deeply] I bought this for you. It's just like the one I had when I was your age. Back when I got my first bike... You wouldn't take it out of the garage without one of these. [Bell rings] I was saving it to give to you for Christmas to go with the big-boy bike your mom was gonna get you. It was just sitting there in my truck. Forgot I even had it. Merry Christmas, little man. Scott : I hear you say that, and I ask myself, "is that grief? Or guilt?" They let you out? I had an alibi. [Radio chatter] Well, then why didn't you come forward? My alibi was Nicole, and I didn't want to hurt Jess. Or you didn't want the MPs to find you. [Scoffs] So brave when they're watching. People like you, buddy, have no idea. In World War II, guys saw 40 days in combat the whole war. In Iraq, I did 310 my first tour alone. I've done four rotations. The brass was planning a fifth. And you know what? I couldn't do it anymore, so I went awol. I couldn't go to my own son's funeral. I didn't kill Tom. I hope not. [Sighs] For your sake, I hope not. For what it's worth, I know he was your son. I'm sorry for your loss. [Crickets chirping] What is it? [Sighs] Ben, what's wrong? Ben, what is it? Scott didn't do it. What are you talking about? He didn't kill Tom. Yes. Of course he did. There's no way. He had to. Cornell let him go. Why? Why would she let him go? He had an alibi! Then who did this? Who would do this... I don't know... To my little boy? I have to know! I  need  to know! I don't know. I don't know. Can't just live not knowing what happened to my son! What if they never find out? I  will find out. I'll find out, and they're gonna pay. Do you promise me? Yes. Yes. I promise. [Shower running] [Knock on door] I'm home. [Shower stops] Can you hand me my clothes? Thanks. [Door opens] Those earrings are really great. Thanks. So, where are you going tonight? A business dinner. [Sighs] What are you doing? [Scoffs] Is there something you want to ask me? You gonna keep it? Keep what? Well, since I know I'm not the father... What are you talking about? Maybe you want to keep this one. Okay. Uh... I see how you got there. But you're wrong. Why do you have the test? I've never cheated on you. Then why was it in the bag? Look, I know what it looks like. And I'm sorry, but I am not prepared to have this conversation right now. [Scoffs] You seriously think you're gonna walk out now?! This is a longer conversation. I am having dinner with the partners and potential clients. I don't care. You  should.  We need the money. Screw the money. We need to talk about this right now. We will talk about this when I get home. [Humming] What, am I too loud? What is it? What happened? [Sighs] My flashlight came back. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? It... it fell out of the truck when I opened it. Okay. [Sighs] You didn't miss it the first time you looked? Somebody put it there. Okay. I thought it was Scott. Uh-huh. He got into the house so easy, why not the truck, right? That makes sense. Yeah, it did, until I found out that Scott didn't kill Tom. What are you telling me? So he never had the flashlight. Do you even know if the flashlight is the murder weapon? It is. Uh-huh. Okay. You didn't touch it, did you? I'm not stupid. I wiped it off. Einstein, that's called tampering, okay? It's a felony. [Sighs] Yeah. The least of my worries. Oh, man. That is really strange that they brought it back to your truck, though. Really? You think? I'm just saying that they could have brought it to the cops, you know? That's what normal people would do. What? Got to get rid of it. How? Someone is trying to set me up. If I leave here to get rid of it, they're watching me, Cornell gets a tip, I get pulled over with the murder weapon. [Sighs] I'll do it. I'll get rid of it. I-I-I'll do it. No way. I-I-I'd never ask you to do that. Anyway, it's in a safe place. You sure? Okay. In that case, can we watch the Panthers game in the house? Because Christy went out to her fancy dinner meeting, right? How do you know where Christy went? [Laughs nervously] Okay, here's the thing. If your bathroom window is open, then I can hear every single... Why didn't you tell me that sooner? Uh... All right, whatever. What did you hear? I'm not one to offer up unsolicited advice, but since you asked, I do not think that Christy is cheating on you. Thanks. Okay, I'm just saying. I don't think it's her test, brother. Then whose is it? Okay, Sherlock, process of elimination. It's not mine, it's not yours, it's not Abby's... It ain't Christy's... [Inhales sharply] Okay. All right. Breathe it out. Breathe it out, brother. Natalie! She's not here. Where is she? You told me to respect her privacy. This is different. I won't get mad at you. Honey, this is about your sister's safety. I will not get mad. She went to Cooper's party. [Stomps foot] You said you wouldn't get mad. I said that I wouldn't get mad at  you. Do you know where Cooper lives? Sweetheart, I promise I won't be mad. I'm 85% sure he totally means it. Is that Natalie's laptop? You promised. It's like the NSA. Dave : Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Maybe you want to count to 10 first. Wait with Abby. [Indistinct talking, laughter] [Loud dance music playing] Hey! Damn! [All cheer] Natalie! Dad? Let's go. What's your problem? No, get out... I'm taking my daughter home. I hate you. I'll get used to it. She doesn't want to go. Get out of my face. [Crowd murmurs] Natalie : No! You come near my daughter again, and I will kill you. Go outside and get in the truck. I am not going anywhere with you. You go outside right now! Or what? Are you gonna kill me, too? Dave : Oh, man. Nat... Natalie, come here. That's enough. Little drunk. [Chuckles] She's just a little drunk. There's no way I'm going anywhere with him. Natalie... I am  not  getting in that truck with you. Fine. Dave'll take you. What, are you gonna walk? Dad. Daddy. I want to go with you. Dad? Yeah? What's wrong with Natalie? I don't know. I just want things to go back to the way they used to be. [Engine turns over] So do I, monkey. So do I. All right. Yeah. Ben : I know it was Natalie's. I wanted to tell you. You should've. I never meant for you to find out this way. I need to know what's going on with my kids. You're right. I'm sorry. [Sighs] Look, she only told me because I promised I wouldn't tell you. Our kids are so lucky to have two parents who care so much about them, parents who  want  to know what's going on in their lives so they can act before something comes along that they can't fix. Ben... There was nothing you could do. I didn't protect him. You didn't know it was your job. I hate what happened to Tom. I hate what's happening to us. I hate what it's gonna do to our girls. Well, there's not anything we can do to change that right now. I think you should start sleeping in our bedroom again. Abby's asking questions. [Knock on door] It's okay. I just need to speak with Mr. Crawford. I think I'll stay. [ Loud dance music playing ] Natalie :  No! Ben :  You come near my daughter again, and I will kill you. Go outside and get in the truck. I'm guessing you didn't notice the 50 teenagers filming you? It's unfortunate you picked that moment to assault and threaten to kill your daughter's boyfriend. I need a statement from Mr. Lindsey. I'll get Dave for you. Thank you. Mm. [Knock on door] [Yawning] What up, G? Hey, man, uh, Cornell's back. There was a video posted on YouTube. You telling me some douche-ling caught you on his cellie? Why the hell does that always happen? She wants your statement. Hey, I didn't see nothing, man. As much as I might need you to lie for me at a later date, it's probably better you tell the truth. [Sighs] Come on. Ow. What? What? Hey, man. Hey, hey. Oh, whoa. I-I-it's not what you think, all right? Listen... listen, she was drunk, brother. I want you out of my house now!! You don't mean it. Come on. Now!! You... Hey! I don't? I don't need... Listen to me! You better go, man. I swear to God, man. Come on. Come on, come on. You know that I would never, never do anything like that. Please. Please. Get out of my house. Bro. Bro, calm down. Get out of my house! I swear to you! I swear to you. I swear to you, I didn't do nothing, okay? I-I'm begging you, please. You're making a really big mistake here. Biggest mistake I ever made was having you for a friend! You need a ride, Mr. Lindsey? Sure. Go! [Sighs] Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. Cornell : I'm gonna need to get something to eat. You mind if we stop on the way? Yeah, I could eat. [Breathing heavily]
