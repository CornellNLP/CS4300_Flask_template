 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Grunts] 
 Help! 
 Somebody help! 
 [Dog barking] 
 Help! 
 [Bangs on door] Christy! 
 I need the phone! 
 [police radio chatter] 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 Woman : I've always felt so safe here. 
 And you know how Matty likes to wander off. 
 Now I'm terrified. 
 Ben... 
 Are you all right? 
 Was it really Tom? 
 He was playing right there yesterday. 
 That boy was like a ray of sunshine. 
 I can't believe this. 
 Has anyone seen Jess? Is she okay? 
 Police just went in to notify her. 
 [Sighs] I can only imagine. 
 What about Scott? Where has he been? 
 We haven't seen him since he and Jess split. 
 I didn't know. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, we need to do as much as we can for her. 
 Jess can't be left alone now. 
 I'm gonna go see my girls. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [Dog barking] 
 I'm okay. 
 Dad, is it true? 
 Is it? 
 Later. There's someone here. 
 Mr. Crawford, Detective Cornell. 
 You want to change? 
 What? 
 You're all wet. 
 Uh, uh, I didn't notice. 
 This shouldn't take too long. 
 Excuse me. 
 Want a coffee? 
 You having some? 
 No. 
 I'd love one. 
 The officer on the scene sent over the notes from your interview. 
 It's terribly shocking what happened. 
 Yeah, I still can't believe it. 
 Of course. 
 I imagine you knew him well. 
 Yeah. Tom lives... he lived across the street his whole life. 
 He used to come here? 
 Yeah, my daughter Natalie babysat him two to three days a week. 
 Jess, Tom's mother, she works part-time, so gave her a break. 
 Milk? 
 Natalie used to babysit him here. 
 Yeah, here and over there. She has a key. 
 Black. 
 Your wife mentioned that you weren't supposed to go jogging this morning. 
 Right, yeah. 
 Usually it's every other day, but I couldn't sleep. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 Everybody has trouble sleeping sometimes, right? 
 I had a couple drinks last night, and I wanted to run them off. 
 So you woke up early. 
 Still dark out? 
 It's hard to see. 
 Did you bring a flashlight? 
 No. 
 Did you see anyone else out there? 
 [Door creaks] 
 It's okay, monkey. 
 This is my younger daughter, Abby. 
 Abby, what did I say? 
 She's all right. 
 Abby, this is Detective Cornell. 
 Hi, Abby. I'm Andrea. 
 Is Tom okay? 
 No, sweetie. 
 Tom... 
 Tom's dead. 
 Do you know what happened? 
 That's what I'm gonna find out. 
 [Woman screams] 
 Dave : Come on, baby. It's all about the dismount. 
 E-easy! It's still sore from last night! 
 Really? 
 Dave! 
 [Screaming] 
 [Dog barking] 
 Wait. [Stammers] 
 Sweetheart, go inside. 
 I'm okay. 
 [Groans] Call me. 
 Go. 
 Did you guys make coffee? 
 No. 
 Ben : He's trying to figure his life out. 
 He's been trying to figure it out since we were 19. 
 Thank you. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I get it. 
 But that kind of thing, the girls... 
 I know. I'll talk to him. 
 Why do they need your clothes? 
 They said it was procedure. 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 How could someone... 
 I know. 
 We should talk to the girls, make sure they're all right. 
 Yeah, tonight. 
 [Door opens] 
 That poor woman. 
 I think we should say something. 
 Ben, I don't think I can go to her right now. 
 But I found him. 
 Jess... 
 Jess... 
 Mr. Crawford. 
 Mr. Crawford... 
 It's probably best if you leave her alone. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 So, you went drinking with your friend Dave last night. 
 How much did you drink? 
 Too much. 
 More than a couple, then? 
 What? 
 Well, earlier, you said you had a couple of drinks. 
 And you drove? 
 No, we took a cab. 
 What does any of this have to do with anything? 
 What time did you get home? 
 Um, 2:00 or 3:00. 
 Which is it, 2:00 or 3:00? 
 Not sure. 
 How did you know? 
 Know what? 
 That Tom was dead. 
 It was dark and wet. 
 When did you first realize that he was dead? 
 [Mumbles] 
 I felt the back of his head. 
 So you moved the body? 
 I tried to resuscitate him. 
 After you felt the back of his head? 
 Before. 
 I saw him lying there, and I shook him, and he didn't respond. 
 I didn't know what to do. 
 I started doing CPR, and that wasn't working, so... 
 I picked him up, and I felt... 
 What are your plans for Christmas? 
 We'll be here. 
 Why? 
 Hmm. 
 [Horn honking] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Vanessa. 
 [British accent] Ben. It's devastating. 
 [Sighs] He was like all of ours. 
 What's going on? 
 Oh, police aren't allowing the rubbish to be collected. 
 [Sighs] They're searching through all our bins. 
 So? Let them. Who cares? 
 Really? 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 He's put off by all the press. 
 They really are a nuisance. 
 Man :  Another story to watch is the resolution of the domestic-assault allegations that have been levied against the former racecar driver. 
 Suarez :  Good afternoon. 
 I'm Roz Suarez with the Channel 7 news update. 
 Tragedy struck today here in Charlotte on Chelsea bay drive when a 5-year-old was found dead. 
 The body of Tom Murphy was discovered by a jogger in the woods near his home, the boy's mother, Jessica Murphy, apparently unaware that her child went missing. Officer : This is 1350. We are at the crime scene. We are locking it down for the night. Please have all officers stationed at the trails locking it down. Man : It's him! Man #2 : That's him? That's the guy? Roberts : Hey! That's the jogger. Rolling. Man #3 : Keep rolling. You want to catch him before he gets in. Mr. Crawford! Sir! Mr. Crawford, are you all right, sir? What do you know? Sir! Tell us what happened. Over here! Tom Murphy... Ben, what did you see? How well did you know the victim? Have you had the chance to speak to the boy's mother yet? Was he alive when you found him? [Bird cawing] Hey, I'm sorry about this morning, man. We overslept. We were hammered. I'm still hammered. Yeah, man, you just got to try not to let the girls see it, all right? We're at least pretending to raise them right, okay? Yeah. Tell Christie you came out here and you spanked me. [Chuckles] I know. She lets me stay here. She does. That poor, little kid. What are they saying now, it's murder? I guess. That's crazy. Who the hell would do something like that? I just keep thinking if I ran faster, maybe I could have gotten there quicker. Don't be so hard on yourself, you know? They're gonna catch that b*st*rd. I hope so. What did you say to that detective? She was weird. She was freaking me out. She was looking at me and stared at me. I know. But what did you say to her? Right. Um, we went out, got tanked, home in a cab. That's it. What? I-I don't know. I just... I can't remember anything about last night. Yeah. That is weird. It's justified, though. You know, you had a blowout with Christy, and you needed to shut your brain off a little. Granted, in retrospect, we might have overshot the mark a teensy bit, but, uh... You think? Yeah. Listen, um, I think we should talk about... No, we shouldn't. Abby : What? He wants to talk about Tom. I don't. Natalie. It's depressing and morbid. I don't want to do this. Natalie, sit down. I'm not hungry. Honey... [Sighs] They don't know who did it, do they? No. Not yet. But whoever it was, monkey, they're... they're far away by now. We're still doing the tree. What? The Christmas tree, and dinner on Christmas day? Sweetheart, I-I don't think we should be talking about that right now. [Silverware clatters] [Indistinct conversations] [Dialing] [Telephone rings, beeps] Jess :  Hi. This is Jess. Tom :  And Tom. Your last name, goose. Oh. [Laughs] Tom Murphy. And we're not home right now. Yes, we are, mommy! [ Both laughing ] Stop tickling me. Oh, yeah? [Cellphone beeps] It's okay, monkey. Mm. Shh. Natalie : Watching me like a hawk. No, he can't find out. He'll go ballistic. Got to go. [Cellphone beeps] What? Bed. I always said you shouldn't go running on that trail. Really? Now? [Sighs] Someone else could have found him. Well, it was me. Where did you go last night? You kicked me out, so I went out. Are we gonna talk about... There's nothing to say. I'm sorry. I want to make this work. So do I, but I don't know if that's possible. You can't just throw away 17 years of marriage. Ben, we met when we were 19. Just a few years older than that. So? Are you the same person? I'm not. Christy... What else haven't you told me? Nothing. After what happened today... [Sighs] This isn't the time to make any decisions. Girls need us. Both of us. I'll drop you both off. I can pick them up. They can take the bus. I am not taking the bus. Get in the car. Roberts : Ben, do the police have any leads? Mr. Crawford, do you think Tom's killer is still around the neighborhood? Ignore them, ignore them. Ben, over here! Do you have any idea what happened? Get in. Man : Ben, is there something else you can tell us?! [Engine turns over] Officer : Mr. Crawford. Mr. Crawford. Roberts : I just want to get one... [Camera shutters clicking] Yeah? Detective Cornell has a few more questions. Where is she? We'd like for you to take a ride with us. 
 
 [Camera shutters clicking] Uh, I just got to... Man : All right, folks, I'm gonna need you to step back off the property. Call me. Turn around. Mr. Crawford... I'm just getting my phone. Man : Do you have some new information in the investigation? Man #2 : What are you going, Ben? Man #3 : What's going on? Roberts : Where are they taking you? Some new information? Where are you going, Mr. Crawford? Where is he going? Which precinct? Ben, where are they taking you? Ben, what happened? Ben, do you have some new information you're gonna share with the police? Officer, is he a witness or a suspect? [Camera shutters clicking] [Indistinct conversations] [Telephone ringing] [Beeps] Danny, what are you doing here? Christy called. I don't need a lawyer. Well, probably not this lawyer. You may need someone that does more than divorces and title transfers. I'm just here to answer questions, right? [Sighs] They haven't indicated to me what they want. [Beeps] Mr. Crawford. Mister...? Pierce. What are we doing here, Detective? My client's been very accommodating. We'd like to get a DNA sample. Mine? I'd like to confer with my client. [Sighs] Why won't she answer me? Because she doesn't have to. What's going on here? Look, you found the body. You were inside the crime scene, all right? It's possible they just want a comparison sample to rule you out as a suspect... Or they think you had something to do with it. I just went for a run. If they had any real evidence, they could just compel a DNA sample. They wouldn't ask. What should I do? Cases like this, there's a lot of pressure to make an arrest, the higher-ups, the media. The cops aren't gonna be looking out for you, so you got to tread very carefully. If it was me, I wouldn't give it to them. Abby : Uncle Michael, I'm bored. Michael : You loved this last year. [Sighs] Ben. Daddy! Michael. Someone needed to watch the girls. Natalie's almost 17. She's upset. [Knocks on door] Nat? ♪ Little, wicked boy ♪ 
♪ come out and shake my hand ♪ What's going on, angel? [Sighs] ♪ I come from where you come from ♪ 
♪ I've seen what you've seen ♪ 
♪ come lay under my wing ♪ 
♪ fade into the night ♪ 
♪ I love you ♪ [Sighs] ♪ I can save you... ♪ Did you respond? [Voice breaking] Tom is dead. How could they do this? I'm so sorry, honey. [Sobs] I'm sorry. Ben : You know, man, if it was just me, it'd be one thing, but I don't know how to make it better. Well, I can just go on to Nat's page and slap those little bitches around for you, brother. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not a good idea. Dude, in the last 36 hours, you had a knockdown with the missus, a hangover of infinite proportions, and you go for a fun run, and you find Tom. If I was you, buddy, I wouldn't be able to get out of bed in the morning. If you were me, I'm pretty sure the run's out of the question. [Laughs] Are there cookies involved? See, you don't know that. How's Christy? She's all right for now. She's gonna stick it out. If you ask me, buddy, I'm kind of surprised after that fight. We've been married a long time. A regular visitor   to the Crawford household, where Crawford's teenage daughter frequently babysat the young boy. Earlier today, police took Crawford for questioning. However, no charges were filed... Turn it off. And we have yet to know whether he's a suspect in this devastating murder. The 5-year-old boy... Your mother said turn it off. [Doorbell rings] By his mother, Jessica Murphy...  Don't answer it. Hey, Kevin. Didn't expect to see you here. I live here. Hello, Christy. Elaine made a lasagna in case you and the girls get hungry. Thanks. Any, uh, word from the police? Anyone who hurts a child, I say kill him. Let God sort it out. I told you he hates me. You must have done something. Anybody been over to see Jess yet? You guys, Tom was here all the time. Nat, you loved him. What's wrong with you guys? Ben, don't. [Sighs] Man : Ben, why did they take you to the police station? Woman : Ben, what did the police say?! Ben, what did the cops want? [Camera shutters clicking] You were there several hours. Are you a person of interest? Have you spoken to Jess Murphy since you found Tom? Didn't your daughter used to babysit Tom Murphy? Ben, you're starting to look guilty. Just give us a statement, Ben. [Indistinct shouting] [Knock on door] Jess? Jess. Detective Cornell, can you tell us anything? Detective, is Mr. Crawford a suspect? Mr. Crawford? Detective, why are you here? You have a moment? [Indistinct talking] I suggest you give me a wide berth. I just know she likes taking pictures of herself. It would be great if you could tell me... hello, Abby. Evening, Mrs. Crawford. I was wondering if you might have any of these. Didn't we get one like that for your birthday two or three years ago? [Garage door opening] [Indistinct shouting, camera shutters clicking] Ben : Every painter has a flashlight. I imagine most people do. I don't know where it went. I'm sure it'll turn up. [Television shuts off] [Engine revving] Hey, what are you doing? [Revving continues] [Grunts] He was right here. Not there? It kind of looks the same in the dark. Did you have a flashlight? Is this a game to you? Hardly. So no flashlight? No. When's the last time you saw yours? No idea. You didn't have a telephone? I already told the officer everything the first time. Why are we out here again? You tried calling Jessica Murphy twice in the last two days. Yeah. She lost her child. Obviously you're not a parent. That must have been some fight you had with your wife the night you went out. That's none of your damn business. If it pertains to this case, it is my business. The killer is out there, and you're wasting your time on me. You know there was a guy on a motorcycle in front of Jess' house at 3:30 in the morning? Were you at Jess' house at 3:30 in the morning? No, I heard him and... Why aren't you investigating anyone else? The night you went out drinking with Dave, how did you get home? I told you. We took a cab. Together? Yes. Hmm. I'm just curious why you won't give us a DNA sample. Are we finished here? [Indistinct conversations] [Police radio chatter] You were just trying to get me out of my house. I'm sorry. I'm late. I have to go to work. What? I'm sorry. Mrs. Crawford. It's okay, sweetie. Dad. It's all right. Dad's here. I'm gonna take care of it, all right? Stay with your sister. It's okay. Hey, no. Do you have a search warrant? Your wife gave us permission. Arrest me. If you think I did it, arrest me. Then get the hell out of my house! Man : Right now. Okay. Abby : M&M's? The snack size. What if you want some? How's it going, Nelson? [Christmas music playing] [Sighs] [Cash register beeping] [Chuckles] You guys open for Christmas? 24 hours, 7 days a week. [Cash register beeps] $8.50. [Cash register opens] Your change? Keep it. [Sighs] [Indistinct talking] Woman : He's back, he's back. Are you rolling on this? Man : Mr. Crawford. Make sure you get a shot of his kid. [Indistinct shouting] Ben, can we get a statement, please? Mr. Crawford. Mr. Crawford, can we get a quick statement from you? There are a lot of rumors going around. [Shouting continues] Man : Mr. Crawford, why are you refusing to give the police a DNA sample? Come on, Ben. Just give us something. What are you hiding, Mr. Crawford? Ben, did you kill Tom? [Voice breaking] Stop it! Leave us alone! [Shouting stops, camera shutters clicking] [Sighs] Come on. Woman : Did the police search your house?! Man : Ben, what happened to that boy? Anything you'd like to add?! [Indistinct shouting] Ben, can we just get a statement? [Sobbing] Woman : Open your mouth, please. One more time. Ben : Let's go, monkey. There's no reason for them to search our house. Come on. A police officer comes to our door, asked me to look around. Next thing I know, there's 10 of them. Why wouldn't you just say no? How could I do that?! They're investigating the murder of a child. [Sighs] Did you tell her we had a fight? Who? Detective Cornell. What? No. What aren't you telling me? [Door closes] Abby: Dad! Our mortgage is late again. I have to go move some money over. Natalie : Maybe make more noise! What are you doing? Abby : I'm looking for something. Abby! Dad! Abby, shut up! I can't find the decorations! ♪ Feel mighty fine, girl ♪ They sell the kit at the mall. Looks pretty as a centerpiece with the gumdrops. Nat could help. Not a chance. We can eat it for dessert. Oh.

All right, uh, you wanted to go home early, and I was trying to seal the deal with what's her face. So I put you in the cab. Why didn't you just tell me that? What was there to tell you? You got home, right? What? How'd you find out? That cop. So thanks for that. 'Cause now I look like a liar. Oh, man. No, no, just, just tell her that you didn't remember what happened. Yeah, 'cause that's gonna go over really well for a murder suspect. Buddy, hey, I'm sorry. Arkin : Hello, Ben. Hey, Mr. Arkin. I'm so sorry about the delays. It's been a crazy week. How much do I owe you? I'm not finished. That's fine. No need. That should take care of it. Hi, Mrs. Bloom. This is Ben Crawford. I was calling to see if you still wanted the foyer repainted. [Camera shutter clicking] Okay. But I have a special going for the holidays. Uh, yeah, but with the weather we've had lately, I'm sure that it could use some... It was redone? Interiors, exteriors, um, anything really. You did? [Sighs] [Cellphone rings] [Beep] Ben Crawford. Mr. Crawford, Andrea Cornell. What do you want? I have some more questions. I'd like you to come down to the station. I'm not gonna let you do this to me. Do what? I didn't kill Tom. I never said you did. I could come to you if you'd prefer. I'll be there in a half-hour. [Glass clinks] [Sobbing] [Glass thuds] Hi, Mr. Crawford. Have a seat. It's a terrible job, this. I've seen some horrific things. Children's cases are the worst... smothered children, burned, children thrown from bridges, beaten 'cause they looked like their mom or drowned so that daddy can't have them or killed just for being around when the world got bad for someone. Usually, it's easy to determine who did it and why... a history of depression, addiction, abuse. But sometimes accidents happen... A mistake. And the person who makes the mistake, they don't know what to do. They don't know how to tell the truth, that it's not too late to tell the truth. 'Cause the truth comes out. It could take an hour... Or it could take 10 years. We don't stop. I  don't stop. So I wanted to give you the chance to tell me what happened. I didn't kill Tom. I had no reason to kill Tom. How many times did you sleep with Jess Murphy? 'Cause I know of at least one. And I can estimate fairly accurately when that was. See, the DNA sample that you gave us, we tested it against Tom's, and the probability of paternity is 99.9%. Mr. Crawford... You did know that Tom was your son?
