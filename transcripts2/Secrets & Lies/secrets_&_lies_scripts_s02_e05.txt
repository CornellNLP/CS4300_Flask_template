 Previously on "secrets and lies"... 
 Who would have killed her, Liam? 
 Do you know about the bank statement? 
 I think it had something to do with Neil. 
 She... she started to look into all of his accounts. 
 Did Kate have any other devices? 
 No. 
 Why did Kate send you that photo? 
 It's my daughter. She's missing. 
 If I see your daughter or her friend, I'll let you know. 
 Sent me the photo when she saw Carly at your party. 
 Rachel. You remember her? 
 You took her and Carly to the Scybox. 
 It's his daughter, man! He's gonna hurt you! 
 Y-your daughter was just there. Carly's a call girl. 
 Detective. 
 Detective. 
 ♪ 
 Detective? 
 What the hell, man? 
 I think your boyfriend, Neil, has got the answers that we need. 
 But Cornell has got him now, so... 
 Have you been working with her this whole time? 
 No. Not at first. 
 Something happened, and I didn't have a choice. 
 So, the only thing you weren't lying about is that everybody lies. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Do you even have a daughter? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, I'm a cop, but I'm not a local one. 
 I'm NYPD. 
 And my daughter  is  missing. 
 ♪ 
 I asked you to meet me for dinner. 
 Where were you? 
 I didn't feel well. 
 You didn't feel well? 
 And I didn't like the other people you invited. 
 The other people? It's just Mitch. He's like an uncle. 
 No, he's your partner. He's not my family. 
 [Thud] 
 What the hell is that? 
 ♪ No, I won't stop ♪ 
 Who the hell are you?! 
 Look... 
 Don't walk. Run! Go. 
 Go! 
 Hey, what is wrong with you?! 
 I'm 18! You're not in charge. 
 Look, my house, my rules. 
 You're not an adult till you act like one. 
 If you weren't such an ass... 
 Whoa. Watch your language, man. 
 I wouldn't have to hide who I'm seeing. 
 You're not seeing anyone! 
 You're just sleeping your way through the whole damn senior class.

 [Door opens, closes] 
 She left later that night, and I haven't seen her since. 
 So, your kid was unhappy, and she left. 
 Doesn't mean she's in trouble. 
 You really think that I'm the type of person that misunderstands the level of danger in a situation? 
 No, I think you're the kind of guy who lies to people for a living. 
 Look, I needed something from Cornell. 
 She needed something from me. 
 Yeah! She needed you to spy on me! 
 No, if I wanted to screw you, I could have told her about Liam's fraud. 
 The Feds would have a field day, man. 
 What did you tell her? 
 Nothing you need to worry about. 
 I'm not worried. 
 I'm no longer a suspect. 
 You know what? Till she's got a perp in chains, no one's in the clear. 
 She, um, give you any updates on the case? 
 If Cornell thought you were just the grieving husband, she would. 
 Test it. 
 You need to go.

 Bryant : This guy is no working stiff. 
 He's got resources and people. 
 All right? You can't just bully him. 
 This isn't my first interrogation. 
 I'm aware of your impressive close rate, Detective. 
 You know, you'd close a lot quicker as part of a team. 
 Let me do my job. 
 Cornell, it's been almost two years since your partner died. 
 I'm getting tired of you making excuses to work solo. 
 We've been over this. I work better alone. 
 Push him as far as you can, but don't let it get to where he invokes. 
 Last thing we need around here is another lawyer. 
 Okay, yeah, I-I did lie. 
 I know the girl in the picture. 
 Carly. 
 Yeah, but it has nothing to do with Kate's death. 
 It's not for you to determine the relevance of anything. 
 How do you know Carly? 
 Um... 
 Look, I've... I've been married three times. 
 So, now I find it easier to pay up front. 
 So, she's a prostitute? 
 I mean, I prefer escort, but, yeah. 
 Yeah, I lied 'cause I was embarrassed. 
 So, that's your story? 
 No, it's not a story. 
 I... look, I screwed her in my car. 
 That's where I was for 30 minutes. 
 And then Liam saw me cleaning up in my office. 
 I swear. 
 The problem is the only way for me to confirm your story  is to interview Carly, and locating her has proven difficult. 
 Look, you know, I'd love to help, but I met her in a bar a few months ago. 
 All I got was a phone number. 
 Not the service number? 
 What? 
 Well, most escorts go through a service until they're comfortable with their client, and then they want to cut out the middleman. 
 Yeah, I don't know about any of that. 
 I just... all I have is her cell. 
 Right, which is conveniently disconnected. 
 Look, lady, that's your problem. I'm sorry that I lied. 
 People are only sorry when they get caught. 
 Look, if I'm not under arrest, I'd like to go. 
 And if I am, I want to talk to my attorney. 
 Have a good night, Mr. Oliver.

 Cornell : You forget your code? 
 From your wife's P.O. Box. 
 Amanda told me Neil was released from custody last night. Why? 
 I don't have to share that with you. 
 As next of kin, I'm entitled to an update on your progress... 
 Or lack thereof. 
 I didn't hold Mr. Oliver for the same reason I didn't arrest you. 
 'Cause he didn't kill Kate. 
 You're both liars, and while that makes you guilty of any number of things, it doesn't prove that you're killers. 
 I didn't lie about being on that roof. 
 I didn't answer under advice from my counsel. 
 Oh, so, you'd never lie to me, Mr. Warner? 
 I'm sure if I did, your friend from the NYPD would tell you. 
 You seemed eager to get your wife's mail back the other day at the police station. 
 Or maybe you were there for something else. 
 Do you have any idea why your wife had a credit-card charge for a private DNA lab? 
 Sorry. No. 
 Maybe it had something to do with the child that she gave up for adoption. 
 That's a delinquent mortgage note from a property in Boone. 
 It seems your wife paid it off. 
 Oh, did you not know about that, either? 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes, Detective. 
 I married a woman I knew nothing about. 
 Now... 
 Don't you have someone else's life to destroy?

 Patrick : Look, everything is gonna be fine. 
 You... you just need to calm down. 
 I can't keep saying the same thing. 
 Eric. 
 Uh, hey, I-I'm sorry about the meeting. 
 I'll deal with you later. 
 I can't believe they let you out. 
 I can't believe you set me up. 
 Did you kill my wife? 
 How can you even think that?! 
 'Cause you lied to me about the hooker at the party! 
 I told you why. 
 Yeah, because you were embarrassed? Come on! 
 Wh-what about the bank statement? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You know exactly what I'm talking about! 
 You set up an account at another bank across town so you could siphon money from this firm! 
 That's insane! Where are you getting this from? 
 Eric, let's just calm down. 
 No. If I find out you killed Kate... 
 I didn't do it, and I'm sick of you accusing me! 
 Neil, leave. 
 Neil! 
 Yeah. 
 I'm going. 
 I quit. 
 Wait. So, Neil really is gone? 
 That... that's not what this family meeting is about. 
 We have convened to discuss Kate's mystery property in Boone. 
 But why would he just quit? 
 With all that's going on, Neil's who you're worried about? 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, look, I'm sorry. 
 Everything's bad, and it just keeps getting worse. 
 So, Kate was paying the mortgage for a J. Cameron? 
 And you have no idea who that is? 
 Something else she was keeping from me. 
 I checked her phone bill. 
 She... she made two calls to an unregistered number in Boone. 
 Well, she did grow up there. I'm sure she knows someone. 
 No. Kate left Boone years ago after her parents died. 
 She had no living relatives and never mentioned any friends... 
 To be fair, she didn't mention a lot of things. 
 [Sighs] 
 As long as I'm being Captain Obvious, did you call the number? 
 Yes, dumbass. I got a woman, okay? 
 She said she never heard of Kate Warner or her maiden name... Martin. 
 But I think she was lying. 
 Why would she lie about that? 
 I think Kate could have been in contact with the extortionist. 
 [Chuckles] Okay. 
 I think you're ready for a tinfoil hat, man. 
 Listen. 
 Kate made the first call to Boone the day before she took $100.000 out of my savings. 
 The second call came two days later. 
 All right, so, what are you gonna do about it? 
 I'm going to Boone. 
 I need answers. 
 I'm going with you. 
 Look, you need to roll deep in case that scary cop shows up. 
 Why would Cornell go to Boone? 
 Not her. The... the one that beat up Neil. 
 He's a cop? 
 I didn't tell you that. 
 Yeah, Neil must have let it slip. 
 What else did Neil let slip, Patrick? 
 That's it. 
 I mean, you... you kind of interrupted. 
 Wait, is the cop working with Cornell? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Badge says NYPD, but Danny's not the problem, okay? 
 He's just looking for this girl, Carly, who was at our party. 
 Well, I'm gonna look into him and see what his story is. 
 You guys be careful. 
 The outskirts of Boone can be pretty backwoods. 
 We... we talking honey boo boo or swamp people? 
 Mm, both. 
 Ooh. 
 Cornell : What am I looking at here? 
 Some hot action for sale. 
 So, even though Carly's burner was disconnected, I used her phone number to contact the provider, subpoena the call history, and that made it pretty easy to figure out which escort service she worked for. 
 Seems she ditched the burner but didn't stop working for the service. 
 Her specialty is lunch at the Y for... $1.000.

 I've, um... 
 I've, um... 
 I've... I've never done this before. 
 Oh, well, don't worry. 
 I don't bite. Un-unless you want me to. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Listen, you... you seem nice. 
 But, uh, since we've never dated before... 
 I'm gonna need the money up front, okay? 
 Sure. Yeah. Okay. 
 Uh, what exactly do... do I do I get... for my money? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, you get a girlfriend for the day. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And unlike your real one, I'll make sure I do everything in my power to make you happy. 
 So, are you ready? 
 It's just... I made the call for a friend. 
 What? Who? 
 Cornell : That would be me. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used... 
 Yeah, I know the drill. 
 In a court of law. 
 You have the right to an attorney. 
 That was definitely entrapment. 
 Carly, I'm murder police. 
 I have no interest in a solicitation bust. 
 Okay. 
 So, what do you want? 
 I want to talk to you about a party you attended at Sherwood equity group. 
 I go to lots of parties. 
 Okay, so, maybe I was wrong about the entrapment thing. 
 You were with Neil Oliver on two occasions, correct? 
 He's a client. 
 And if you think about, I'm in sales. 
 I understand. 
 A girl's got to eat. 
 Do you recognize anybody else in the photo? 
 No. 
 I'm trying to make this quick and painless. 
 If you don't want to cooperate, my hands are tied. 
 I'm telling the truth. 
 When I'm with a man, I'm paid to make him feel special. 
 I don't notice anyone else. 
 And the night of the party? 
 Did you make Neil feel special? 
 In his car. He wasn't half bad. 
 And this woman was at both events. 
 Did you notice or talk to her? 
 That's the chick they scraped off the sidewalk. 
 No. I've never seen her before. 
 Then how do you know she went off the side of the building? 
 It was in the news. 
 [Chuckles] Look, you obviously wanted to check Neil's alibi, and I told you where he was. 
 Can I go? 
 No. 
 You said you didn't care about solicitation. 
 I guess we're both accomplished liars. 
 [Scoffs] Your bedside manner sucks. 
 Depends on the bed. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey, honey. 
 Why are you here? 
 I brought some snacks for the boys. 
 It's a long drive. 
 Patrick : Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. Oh! Unh, unh, unh. 
 Give me that. Nope, nope, nope. 
 You need to focus if you're going to watch your brother's back. 
 That's cruel and unusual punishment. 
 Mm. 
 No worse than being married to  her. 
 Okay, he's going to Boone, not Iraq. 
 Okay, you know what, Amanda? 
 Affection is key to a successful marriage. 
 Oh, silly me. 
 You're single now, right? Is that what I heard? 
 Um... 
 W-we should hit the road, right, Eric? 
 Yep. All right. 
 Yeah, uh, honey? 
 I told Patrick that you and Greg split so he wouldn't say something stupid and make it worse. 
 I should have known that he would tell Melanie. 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I just wasn't ready for anyone else to know. 
 I know. 
 Especially not her. 
 I know, but you know what? 
 We... we really have too many secrets in this family, Amanda. 
 Way too many secrets. It's... it's just unhealthy, and it's got to stop. 
 We are now officially out of our element. 
 I've got one. 
 You know you're backwoods when a full tank of gas doubles the value of your car. 
 [Laughs] 
 So, uh, tell me about that New York cop. 
 I don't know much about him. 
 I mean, like, what is his endgame? 
 Whatever it is, he's not gonna tell me the truth. 
 W-why do you think Cornell used him, though? 
 I have no idea. 
 Maybe she's trying to set me up. 
 Who knows? 
 Why is he looking for that girl? 
 Why are you so obsessed with the guy? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm... I'm just making conversation. 
 [Chickens clucking] 
 I think I hear them slaughtering the spring lambs. 
 Are you sure this is the place? 
 Same address as on the mortgage bill. 
 [Clucking continues] 
 All right. The city of Boone, I get. 
 It's a college town, right? 
 But who the hell is gonna live all the way out here? 
 [Sighs] 
 I've been waiting for you to come knocking. 
 How do you know Kate Warner? 
 You mean Kate Martin? 
 That's her maiden name. 
 So, how do you know her? 
 She's my daughter. 
 Huh. 
 So, she married you. 
 Why would Kate tell me you were dead? 
 I don't know why she would... 
 So, you two weren't close. 
 What do you think? Kate left when she was 16. 
 We haven't spoken since. 
 Why are you asking all these questions? 
 Did you know Kate paid your mortgage? 
 No. 
 Mm. Makes sense now, though. 
 Why is that? 
 Bank's been chasing me for a year, and finally, the calls stopped a few weeks ago. 
 I figured they were done trying to get money and eviction was next. 
 That's who I thought you were... process servers. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, if Kate wants me to pay her back, you tell her to call me. I'm no freeloader. 
 We can figure out a payment plan when I find work. 
 [Sighs] 
 Um, can we come in? 
 There's something we need to tell you. 
 Yeah.

 What do you want? 
 I'm investigating a murder.

 I already gave you my statement. 
 And now I need your outfit from the night of the party. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You've defended enough killers to know I'll be asking all key witnesses to provide their garments. 
 Oh, I see. Now that you have, uh, shifted your focus from my brother, you are grasping at straws. 
 I'm casting a wider net. 
 Detective, I did not kill Kate. 
 I loved her. 
 You didn't. 
 [Laughs] I shouldn't have. 
 And I never will again. 
 Okay, maybe one more time. [Laughs] 
 You said, and I quote, "he's the guy who you never, ever, ever sleep with because you will wake up crushed under a mountain of regret."

 You... you have restraint. 
 You're really kind of perfect, actually. 
 No, I-I'm not perfect. 
 [Laughs] [Sighs] 
 Okay, I-I'm not... I'm not proud of this. 
 When I was younger... 
 There was this... there was this guy that I-I really wanted, but he was about to propose to someone else, and I... 
 I went for him anyway. 
 [Gasps] 
 Did you get him? 
 I did. 
 But it was wrong. 
 You know, I was young. I-I wanted what I wanted at the time. 
 I didn't care who I was hurting. 
 Oh, my god. 
 You're totally flawed. 
 [Laughs] 
 I am so relieved. 
 [Laughs] 
 I don't know why I told you that. 
 Well, a lot of people tell me things they don't want me to know. 
 I still need your outfit. 
 All right. Fine. But it's been dry-cleaned. 
 You don't know what I'm looking for. 
 I will get it to you right away. With Eric's juvenile record. 
 My father has that, and he is out of town. 
 You will get it when he returns. 
 Is he in Boone with your brothers? 
 No. 
 Where is he? 
 I don't know. Business meetings. 
 Is that all? 
 Never thought for a second I wouldn't see my baby again. 
 You said you hadn't talked to Kate in years. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Yes. Why do you keep asking me? 
 Because I think you did. 
 And she told you things about my brother that you used as ammunition for blackmailing him. 
 Who do you think you are? 
 You come into my house and tell me that my daughter is dead, and then you accuse me of that. 
 It isn't just an accusation. 
 Kate called you, twice. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yeah, that isn't my number. It's Jake's. 
 Who is Jake? 
 An old boyfriend. 
 Did... did they... 
 Did they date a long time? 
 Jake wasn't her boyfriend. He was mine. 
 Why would Kate want to talk to an old boyfriend of yours? 
 [Scoffs] Maybe she still had a thing for him. 
 I-I'm so confused. 
 Well, let me spell it out, college boy. 
 Jake was mine until Kate stole him away. 
 No. No, you said Kate left when she was 16. 
 Oh, you think a 16-year-old can't wag her ass when she wants to? 
 I did plenty for that girl. 
 Being a single mom and the sacrifices you make... 
 [Voice breaking] And she took away the only thing I ever really loved. 
 Wait, so your boyfriend... 
 Was he the father of Kate's baby? 
 It's time for you to go. 
 Is that why she left town? 
 It's none of your business. 
 I'm her husband. 
 [Door opens] 
 She's dead. 
 If your wife wanted you to know, she would've told you. 
 Get out. 
 Get out! 
 Just got the final report on the non-core witnesses the night your victim pancaked. 
 Anything interesting? 
 The usual crap. 
 Everybody's got an opinion, nobody saw anything workable. 
 Guys in the tech division showed me footage of a woman hesitating outside the building a few hours before the murder, but, uh, when I showed this screen grab to witnesses, no one could I.D. her. 
 [Cellphone ringing, buzzing] 
 Who's Ethan Barrett? 
 Nobody. It's just... 
 The Warners are the only ones I haven't shown that to, so maybe one of them knows her? 
 Do you know if she was entering the building or leaving? 
 It looked like she couldn't decide, and then she went in. 
 And I scanned the security footage for her exit... I never saw her leave, which means she probably left between 7:00 and 10:00 when the footage was erased. 
 So, she could've still been in the building when Kate Warner was murdered. 
 Do me a favor and go get me a copy of the security footage. 
 Anything else? Coffee? Tea?

 Take the girls back inside. 
 It's okay. 
 Listen, I know why you're here. Janice called. 
 But Kate is in the past, so we got nothing to talk about. 
 How old were you?

 She was 16. 
 How old were you? 
 26, okay? But it was not like that. 
 Like what? Like what? 
 You don't understand the relationship. 
 Eric, let it go. 
 Relationship? 
 You raped her! 
 S-she wanted it just as bad. 
 Oh, I'm okay. 
 Can I just... can I have a minute? 
 I heard what was said and we will discuss it later. 
 [Door opens] All right. 
 [Door closes] 
 I am sorry for you loss, but what happened 20 years ago... 
 It was mutual, all right? 
 I mean, the age of consent is 16, so it wasn't illegal. 
 No, it was just wrong. 
 You know, at the time, I didn't see that. 
 It's different now. I have... I have daughters. 
 You know, hard as it would've been, I was the adult. 
 I should've resisted. 
 But I really did... care for her. 
 Why did Kate call you? 
 Was it about the baby? 
 The first time was to see if I still lived here, and... 
 A few days later, she called to say she was in town. 
 She wanted to meet. 
 She met with you? 
 Kate : Look, I get that this must be weird, hearing from me after all these years. 
 Yeah, I'm... I'm not gonna pretend it isn't. 
 You been to see your mama? 
 I-I hear she's got financial troubles. 
 No. No, you, uh, remember what that was like. 
 I do. 
 And I wish I could say she was doing better. 
 I stayed in touch to be polite... 
 You know, small town and all... 
 But God knows she's as angry as ever. 
 Look, I'm... I'm not here to catch up. 
 It's about the kid, right? 
 When I left town with... 
 With our baby, I was broke. 
 I wanted him to have a better life. 
 I had no choice but to put him up for adoption. 
 I should've done more. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 We all made mistakes in the past. 
 I'm here about the present. 
 I found the parents. 
 I talked to them. 
 [Voice breaking] Our son's name is Charlie. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 You speak to him? 
 No, no. Not yet. 
 The agency, they contacted him, but he's away at school. 
 So... so they're okay with you meeting him? 
 The dad, he seems receptive. 
 The... the mom not as much. 
 But I get that, you know? 
 She raised him from infancy when I couldn't. 
 The dad, he, um... 
 He gave me this. 
 He's a beautiful kid, isn't he? 
 If I do talk to Charlie, he'll probably ask who his father is. 
 So can I tell him? 
 Eric : What did you say? 
 Told her "no." 
 Wow.

 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 No, man! No! 
 Mitch wouldn't, okay? 
 This was staged. Somebody set this up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Suicide note's addressed to you. 
 [Siren wailing, radio chatter] 
 Cornell : Your partner abused your daughter? 
 Since she was 13 years old. 
 You know, I brought Mitch into her life, told her he was family. 
 That's not your fault. 
 Those types of predators, they hide their sickness well. 
 She trusted him because I said he was okay. 
 'Cause he had your back. He was your partner. 
 How could you have known? 
 Here you go. 
 [Sighs] 
 Turns out one of the victims came forward, then another... 
 And he took the easy way out. 
 'Cause he knew what you would do to him. 
 I mean, I'm... 
 No, I should have seen the signs in Rachel... 
 Depression, promiscuity. 
 I have your daughter's friend in custody. 
 Okay. 
 Look, I need to speak to her because she invited Rachel here and she knows where she is. 
 I'll get that information for you, but you need to stay out of sight and stay out of my investigation. 
 We clear? 
 Thank you, Detective. 
 Thank you. 
 Call me Andrea. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 What do you need, Detective? 
 Break out Carly Sinclair. 
 I want to take her back to the interview room. 
 She was cited out an hour ago. Sorry. 
 I had a hold on her. 
 She's a witness in my murder investigation. 
 They said to kick her, and I did. 
 That stuff's above my pay grade. 
 Who ordered her release? 
 That's above  your  pay grade.

 After seeing what Kate went through, I guess we should count our blessings... 
 Don't take heat like that 'cause we were raised better than that. 
 You serious? 
 What? 
 It was different, not better. 
 It wasn't that bad. 
 Every time Dad went away, Mom turned into a bitter, drunken bully. 
 It wasn't every single time. 
 Every time, Patrick. 
 You were terrified of her. 
 ♪ So easily ♪ 
 It wasn't like she had it easy. 
 I mean, there were three of us, Dad was always away. 
 You were too young to remember or you blocked it out. 
 It was bad. 
 Ask Mandy. 
 ♪ I don't really wanna make you sick ♪ 
♪ and you don't really wanna know ♪ 
 Hey, I know it wasn't much fun, but, uh... I appreciate you coming with me. 
 Burger was good. 
 [Laughs] 
 You know, I thought we'd get answers. 
 [Horn honks] 
 Well, we kind of did, just not to the pressing questions. 
 It wasn't a total loss. 
 You got to meet your mother-in-law. 
 And we haven't done a road trip in a while. 
 Even if we did fight half the day. 
 Even if I'm mad at you, I still love you, bro. 
 Thanks, man. 
 If it wasn't for you and Mandy, I don't know what I'd do. 
 And Dad. 
 I know you guys are kind of fighting right now, but you should call him. 
 Old man would walk through fire for you. 
 But, if you're okay, I have a much needed cocktail waiting for me at home. 
 [Door opens] 
 What's he doing here? 
 You want to keep driving? 
 I can handle this. Go home. 
 You sure? I can lay on the horn till the neighbors come down. 
 Is that something you learned in your women's self-defense class? 
 Yeah, Mel did. But my lack of balls aside, it's a pretty good emergency plan in this situation. 
 I got this. Go home. 
 [Sighs] I'm not in the mood. 
 I'm sorry I lied to you, but I need your help. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Look, I divorced my wife seven years ago. 
 At least she's alive. 
 No, no. 
 She died three years later. 
 Cancer. 
 Okay, my daughter is the only thing that I have left in the world. 
 Without you, I won't be able to find her. 
 Just hear me out. 
 Please. 
 It's been a long day, and I've got a lot on my mind, so make it fast. 
 Cornell arrested Carly earlier. 
 Great. Isn't that what you wanted? 
 Now she can tell you where your daughter is... 
 But before Cornell could find out anything about Rachel, the cops released Carly. 
 Why would they do that? 
 Probably 'cause she serviced a few key members of the Department. 
 Carly could be in another state by now, so the only way that I'm gonna get answers about my daughter is through your buddy Neil. 
 He uses her services, man. It's not like they hang out. 
 Look, you think if she was just some hooker that he'd invite her to your office party? 
 He had to be sure she wasn't gonna embarrass him. 
 Neil knows Carly better than he's saying. 
 He's a proven liar. 
 Look who's talking. 
 Neil quit. 
 Cornell thinks he didn't kill Kate, so it's really not my problem. 
 Really? You find the bank statement Liam told us about? 
 Okay, the kid said that Neil has something to do with it. 
 It makes sense... he's the one that went in and took it out of Kate's desk. 
 And if Neil was doing some shady financial crap and Kate caught him... 
 Everyone lies. 
 Liam is a liar, so it makes sense that he would stay true to form. 
 Rachel was with Neil and Carly in your firm's Scybox. 
 Neil's my last connection to my daughter. 
 If he's gonna tell the truth to anybody, it's you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Your wife is dead. 
 I don't want that to happen to my daughter. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Patrick called me. Why is he here? 
 It's okay. 
 No, it's not. 
 Your New York cop has a bench warrant out for his arrest. 
 You walked away mid-testimony in a major narcotics case. 
 He's just looking for his missing daughter, Mandy. 
 Or he's using her as an excuse because he was paid to throw the trial. 
 You know my record is spotless. I... 
 Save it. 
 I have already contacted CMC PD about you stalking my brother, and they know where you are right now. 
 If I were you, I would leave before the cops get here. 
 We need to talk. 
 Are you here to explain to me how my solicitation suspect was released? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Too many eyes went to the floor when I walked her through this bullpen. 
 Who are you accusing? 
 You tell me. 
 Somebody's getting kickbacks from the escort service or favors directly from her. 
 I got a call from Amanda Warner. 
 I know about the New York cop you're using as an informant. 
 What the hell were you thinking? 
 He's looking for his runaway daughter. 
 I've never known you to give a damn about anything if it didn't relate to a case you're working on. 
 If you were concerned about your daughter, wouldn't you let a drug dealer walk? 
 I don't have a daughter. 
 And it's no secret that you put the job before yours. 
 So we both know that this is more about the information the guy's feeding you than any concern you have for his daughter. 
 My personal life is off limits to you. 
 He wants his daughter. I want my killer. 
 The relationship has worked out so far. 
 I don't give a crap about the deal you made with him. 
 I put you on this case because you're the best detective in this unit. 
 I put my trust in you, and so far, I've only gotten grief. 
 If you want me to close this case, then let me work. 
 You work for me. 
 You broke protocol and probably the law. 
 And if the NYPD brass gets wind of the fact that you've been harboring one of their detectives as a fugitive, holy hell will rain down on this department. 
 Both our jobs are on the line, and I will not take a bullet for you. 
 I-I didn't ask you to. 
 Forget the case. 
 Either place that cop under arrest or you're suspended. 
 Am I clear?
