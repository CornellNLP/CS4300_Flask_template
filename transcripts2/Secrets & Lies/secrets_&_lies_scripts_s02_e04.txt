 Kate's assistant, Liam... Could be the son she gave up for adoption. 
 Your company's secure data has been breached. 
 Kate was onto Liam. 
 We're not gonna tell the police anything. 
 Did it ever occur to you that Liam may have killed Kate to cover it up? 
 I'm looking for her. Her name is Carly. 
 How did you get that photo? 
 Your wife sent it to me right before she died. 
 Where's Liam? 
 Danny : Yeah, she knows where Liam is, but she's not talking... Yet. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yeah, I see you doing the math. 
 Do you run? Dial 911? 
 Problem is, you want answers. 
 And by the time the cops show, me and her will be gone. 
 So are you staying, or are you going? 
 You won't hurt her? 
 That's up to her. 
 I need answers. 
 Look, Liam is a con man, a criminal. 
 Stepping into this world, you need to know two things... 
 Everyone's lying, and stay out of my way. 
 So, where's your boyfriend at? 
 I told you he's not my boyfriend. 
 I met him out maybe a month ago. 
 Okay, and he bought you a 79-inch 3-D TV? 
 I just thought he really liked me. 
 So Liam, the legit assistant, blew 30 grand on a month-long crush? 
 Really?! That's your story?! 
 Are you that dumb?! 
 [Crying] 
 Look, give it up. 
 I'm not buying the babe in the woods act. 
 You are gonna call Liam and get him to meet you. 
 I told you... 
 No. Look. 
 You are gonna call Liam and get him to meet you. 
 Now. 
 Where? 
 Dinah's in south Tryon. 
 What's your name? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 What happens if she warns him? 
 What happens if you warn him? 
 Something bad.

 You just said the Warner forensics report was here. 
 It was. 
 Have a seat, detective. 
 Is that my forensics report? 
 I'm proud that in the six months you've been working for me, we've already developed a shorthand. 
 We have a shorthand? 
 Yes. 
 When you march in here barking at me, I know that's shorthand for, "I'm ready to update you, sir." 
 And when I say, "please have a seat," you know that's shorthand for "sit your ass down." 
 The Tom Murphy case is still fresh in the minds of many people. 
 I solved the murder of a 5-year-old. 
 I know that, and you know that, but all the D.A. knows is you brought evidence that overturned their Ben Crawford conviction. 
 Not before he was murdered in prison. 
 The D.A. was humiliated, and now that office is out to get you. 
 So why did you put me on this case? 
 The Mayor is friends with John Warner. 
 He asked for my best detective. 
 Imagine my dilemma. 
 This case will be bulletproof, sir. 
 The stems from the plant on the rooftop were freshly broken, confirming your take on where the struggle took place. 
 Where are you with your witnesses? 
 It's too early to say. 
 I know a lot of cops in here blame you for detective Dale's death, but since I'm not one of them and you need an ally, how about you not treat me like a complete moron? 
 I have two witnesses I haven't found yet. 
 One is Kate's assistant, the other an unidentified female party guest. 
 I also have a high-level S.E.G. employee with no credible alibi, but I can't prove he's lying... Yet. 
 Good. Go prove it. 
 But play nice, huh? 
 At least until we make an arrest. 
 Oh, you know me. I'm a people person.

 You warned him off. It's "something bad" time, all right? Let's go. 
 You said you weren't gonna hurt her. 
 No, I said it was up to her.

 So you think Liam could've killed your wife? 
 Kate knew he was getting credit cards by using our clients' identities. 
 If she confronted him... 
 Let's just say it's a question I'd like to ask him. 
 Well, then maybe you should've thought about that before letting his girlfriend escape. 
 So, how do we find this kid? 
 How do you know my wife? 
 You didn't answer me. 
 Why did Kate send you that photo? 
 I'll tell you after we find Liam. 
 No. No. You'll tell me now. 
 Well, someone's balls finally dropped. 
 Kate texted me the photo because I asked her to help me.

 First time we bought clothes for our daughter, my wife had the same look on her face. 
 How old's your daughter now?

 Her name's Rachel. 
 That's a beautiful name. 
 Check this out. 
 This is, uh... This is me and rach, um, when she was in little league. 
 She was 5 years old. 
 And that's us at Rockefeller Center. 
 She was 13. 
 She's so sweet.

 It's the company Skybox. 
 And that's my daughter and her friend and you and your husband. 
 Uh, I-i don't understand. 
 She's missing. 
 Um, she came down here seven weeks ago to see her friend, and nobody's seen her since. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I-I-i don't... I don't remember her. 
 Look, I-i know you're only a few months along, and already you love that baby. 
 Imagine 18 years for that love to grow and... 
 Then your baby's just gone. 
 I want to help you. I-i do. 
 But I... 
 I don't remember Rachel or... Or her friend. 
 It... it's a Skybox. 
 You know, random people come and go all night. 
 Okay. I'm sorry if I scared you. 
 Um, this is my cell just... Just in case. 
 If I see your daughter or her friend, I'll let you know. 
 Oh. 
 I promise you. 
 All right, thank you. 
 [Door opens] 
 And Kate kept her word. 
 She sent me the photo when she saw Carly at your party. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hmm, for my daughter being missing, or for letting my best lead to finding her get away? 
 I was concerned you were gonna hurt her. 
 Okay, what if she was involved in Kate's murder? 
 How concerned for her would you be then? 
 You see, right now our interests align. 
 Okay, as long as it stays that way, nobody's gonna get hurt. 
 No one. 
 You mean me.

 Sorry. Guess I got a little carried away. 
 Um, but carnage is amazing, though. 
 My girl put me onto him, and we see him basically every time he plays in town. 
 Plus if you wear one of his t-shirts, you get in for free. 
 Mm. What do you have to wear to get out? 
 I think we walked in on him hacking into our clients' information, so he improvised. 
 But when he used the deejay to try and distract us, he accidentally used the truth.

 You're gonna sit in jail until you go to trial for taking that woman's farm. 
 And when they try you, you're gonna plead guilty and take that five-year-minimum sentence. 
 Screw you. 
 If you don't, I'm turning you in for what you did at S.E.G. 
 It'd destroy the firm. 
 Yep. 
 But the company is mine. 
 And my wife is dead. 
 But you... 
 You're gonna get 40 years. 
 So I'm okay with that. 
 She gave you a chance you didn't deserve, and you took advantage of her. 
 Enjoy the next five years scumbag... 
 Where's Neil? 
 He finally closed the deal. 
 I'll give you one guess. 
 Good night. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Now who's not answering their phone? 
 I heard you had a conversation with Greg. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. 
 For what? 
 That you're going through this. 
 You've been so busy helping me. 
 I've been so focused on myself. 
 I didn't even notice. 
 I'm sorry I made you feel like you couldn't tell me. 
 I couldn't tell anyone. 
 Why? 
 It's a long story that I don't really want to get into. 
 But when I do, you'll be the first. 
 Listen, I'm gonna be a better brother to you, Mandy. 
 I'm supposed to have your back. 
 Well, from the way Greg told it, you did. 
 Yeah. 
 Please don't tell anyone. 
 Tell anyone? About what? 
 Always did have my back.

 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Hey, man. Figured I'd find you here. 
 Huh, you still came? 
 [Sighs] Just wanted to congratulate you on closing the steelworkers union. 
 Thank you? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, it took you long enough. 
 Oh, screw you. I want a raise. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 How about a ride instead? 
 Oh, I'm still celebrating. 
 Oh, no, I got better booze at the loft. 
 Really? 
 Go back and play some "Madden." 
 "Madden"? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Oh. I would love to. 
 Let's do it. 
 See what you can do. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 All right. 
 Just like old times, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 Eric : He's all yours. 
 Who is? 
 I wasn't talking to you. 
 Oh! God! What the hell?! 
 You lied to me about that girl. 
 What girl? 
 You know what girl. 
 You took her to the damn party. 
 Say her name. 
 Oh! 
 C-Carly. It's Carly. 
 What about her friend Rachel? 
 You remember her? 
 You took her and Carly to the Skybox, huh? 
 I-I think so. I think so. 
 It's... it's Carly's friend. 
 Ohh! 
 [Groaning] 
 You don't want to do this. 
 Kate is dead. Why are you lying? 
 It's his daughter, man! He's gonna hurt you! 
 I can't help you unless you tell him the truth. 
 [Stammers] 
 Y-your daughter was just there, okay? 
 Carly was my date to the party and to the Skybox. 
 So why would you lie about that? 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 I screwed Carly in my car at a company party. 
 I didn't want to lose my job. 
 And... and... and I didn't want to get in trouble with her people. 
 What? 
 She's a pro. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, Carly's a call girl. 
 Aaah! Ugh! 
 Ohh. 
 You better hope she answers. 
 [Beeps] 
 Woman : The mobile number you are trying to reach has been disconnected or is no longer in service. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Expecting somebody? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I'm so sorry. I just didn't want you to judge me. 
 There's something else you're still not telling me, man. 
 [Door unlocks] 
 Detective. 
 Detective.
