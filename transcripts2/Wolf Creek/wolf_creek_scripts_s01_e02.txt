 Where can I wash? 
 Oh, the bathroom's blocked, so you'll have to use the trough. 
 (CASH REGISTER CLACKS) 
 Cashier : 41.80, thanks. 
 Um... I don't need this.

 Woman : Hey, dickhead. (COCKS GUN) 
 Know what the Maori word for 'nuisance' is? 
 Hoha. And that's what you're being, bro. 
 A real hoha. Boo! 
 (LAUGHS) 
 You want a coffee? 
 Eve : I wasn't scared of him. 
 (WOMAN CHUCKLES) 
 You know? 
 Woman : Come on. 
 (BIRDS TWEET) 
 Woman : What more could a lady want than a rig that hauls 22 tonnes of fuel one minute, boils a jug the next? 
 Go ahead. 
 It's not poisoned. 
 Thanks. 
 So, what did that, then? 
 Trap for an animal, I think. 
 You're not from round here. 
 I'm... 
 ...looking for the man who drives this. 
 The blue truck in the background. 
 Woman : Lot of F100s on these roads. 
 Yeah, but it's got... It's got a strange frame. 
 He's a shooter. 
 Lot of shooters too. 
 Why are you looking for him? 
 And what do you do when you find him? 
 (CLEARS THROAT) Now, I'm not much of an expert, but what's a girl your age doing travelling alone? 
 You're gonna get eaten up and swallowed whole. 
 If you want to survive around here, you can't take sh1t like that anymore. 
 I wasn't. 
 Gotta be tough. 
 10 times tougher than they are and 100 times tougher than you feel. 
 Kia kaha. Be strong.

 (DEVICE BEEPS) 
 I'm really sorry about your car. 
 I think it's just... my brakes need a service. 
 Huh! 
 I'll get onto it. 
 Yeah. OK. 
 You know the car's unroadworthy, don't ya? 
 Can I just pay the fine? 
 (SNIFFS) 
 Whose is this? 
 Eve : I told you, it's not mine. I've never seen it before. 
 I had no idea it was there. 
 Need the ladies, let me know. 
 Eve : Hey, I had a dog. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Pardon the grievous curiosity, but... 
 ...what does land a girl like you in a place like this? 
 Traffic infringements. 
 What about you? 
 Take a wild guess. 
 (OTHER PRISONER DEEPLY INHALES AND EXHALES REPEATEDLY)

 (DOG BARKS OUTSIDE) 
 Mongrel. 
 Psst! (CLICKS) 
 You're an American, aren't ya? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Sing me something. 
 Like what? 
 Oh, I don't know. You know, bloody Taylor Swift, Beyonce. 
 That weird bloody Gaga chick. They're all Yanks, aren't they? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Well, you're a Yank. They're Yanks. 
 You're a bloody Yank. Everyone's a Yank. 
 Come on, f*ckin' sing me something. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 This her? 
 Yep. 
 I'm gonna need you to release her into my custody. 
 What, you want to take someone facing multiple charges across the border? 
 We can lay any charges you need in the Darwin District Court. 
 Something wrong with the courts in WA? 
 This woman here is part of an ongoing investigation in the Territory. 
 So? 
 Got your extradition order? 
 I need to take her with me, Constable. 
 Well, my hands are tied, Sergeant. 
 She'd be facing a few years inside. You know that, don't ya? 
 You want to take her across the border? Get the paperwork. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (GASPS) 
 (DOG BARKS OUTSIDE) 
 You reckon I'd fit? 
 (LAUGHS) Yeah, maybe. 
 You reckon you'll reach?

 (SNORING) 
 I'm gonna think of a couple more things for you to do first. 
 (SNORING) 
 (GROANS) 
 What? 
 (EVE GRUNTS) 
 (GROANS) 
 (WINDOW OPENS) 
 (GROANS) 
 Woman : So did anyone pick up that dead roo from up the road? 
 Man : Yeah, there's a fella who's down the road. 
 He goes and gets it every day, so... 
 (CONVERSATION CONTINUES) 
 You getting ready for the Sydney haul? 
 They changed the roster, so I'll be stuck here all week. 
 When will you be home? 
 Oh, when the job's done. 
 A few days. 
 A few days?! 
 Why can't they send someone else to do it? 
 Because it's my case. 
 Well, when you catch him, give him a slap from me. 
 Who? 
 The runaway kid you've been chasing. 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Hang on a sec. 
 (HILL GROANS, OPENS DOOR) 
 What are you doing here? 
 She just let me off with a warning. 
 She said it was too much paperwork. 
 Guess she must have decided I'm not such a big-time crim after all. 
 She didn't realise she could have added stealing police property to your charge sheet. 
 Eve : I only took that file 'cause you weren't doing your job properly. 
 Hill : Where is it? 
 Are you gonna leave me standing out here... 
 Where's the file? 
 I lost it. 
 Uh, I... I put it on top of the car one morning, and it... 
 Sorry. 
 Can I have some money? 
 Please. I just need a couple of hundred. 
 I'll pay it all back. 
 Look. 
 This country's too big, OK? You're not gonna find him. 
 Eve : I'm wasting my time. 
 Where are you going? Hey, stop. Come on. 
 Hey, sorry, something's come up. I've gotta go. 
 I'll call you tomorrow. 'Bye. 
 Every second that my dad wasn't at work, he was trackside. 
 He was coaching me. 
 200, 100 hurd, long, high, shot, jav, 800... 
 Pentathlon. 
 (LAUGHS) Yeah. 
 Yeah, and he had all these mantras, like "Chest up, shoulders down. Hold strong in the core. Drill it through to the point. Lift your toes. Catch flies." 
 Like, relax your jaw. Don't tense up. 
 
 
 
 I loved it. 
 I loved winning, loved... getting PBs, but, you know... after 13 years, it's... 
 Halfway through my sophomore year, I needed a shoulder reconstruction, and they gave me these really strong drugs. 
 Opiates. 
 And, yeah, they stopped the pain, but, um, I... developed a... a problem. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe I was addicted. 
 Because... 
 I was pretty set to represent my country, and then, um, I broke into the campus infirmary. 
 How'd you do your shoulder? 
 I fell down some stairs. 
 You were drunk. 
 I was drunk. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Woman : Housekeeping! 
 Must have been one hell of a fall, huh? 
 Mom always said I never did things by halves. 
 Evening, Detective Sergeant, and guest. 
 Oh! 
 Woman : I dunno how you do things in the Territory, but in WA, us coppers generally like to avoid harbouring fugitives. 
 (BANGS ON DOOR) She said that you let her out. 
 Yeah, and she climbed out the bloody window like a monkey. 
 Eve! I'm gonna knock it down if you don't open it. 
 One, two... 
 (GROANS) 
 You took her wallet and her passport? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Good. 
 Her car's a write-off. 
 She's probably just gonna hide behind the bushes overnight. 
 We'll find her in the morning. 
 Yep! 
 And thanks for your cooperation!

 What I shoulda done is just left you there, teach you a lesson. 
 Oh, you're f*ckin' on your f*ckin' rags again, are ya? 
 Do you know how long I was there, setting up today? 
 This is the biggest job I've ever done. Huh? 
 And where are you? Locked up in the drunk tank. 
 Having a little singalong with some Yankee chick. 
 Man 1 : Whatever, you dickhead. So where's the cash, eh? 
 Man 2 : Huh?

 Ginger : Beardy, can you hear this sh1t? 
 Beard : Yeah, yeah, I'm hearing it. 
 Beard : Yeah, it's true, mate. I remember it clear as day. 
 Kane : Do you mind?! 
 I am having a private conversation with my brother here. 
 Beard : Sorry, mate. Sorry. 
 Sorry? Oh, you're sorry, then? 
 (UNZIPS BAG) 
 Woman : Hi, sweetie! 
 Did they feed you in the jailhouse? Want a spag bol? 
 Kane : Yeah, that sounds very nice, Mum. Thank you. 
 Kane : Know what I hate most about you? 
 Your f*cking face, mate. 
 I hate your ugly f*ckin' mug. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Mum : You right for a beer, boys?

 That's an '87 Commodore, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 Well, it looks like it's your lucky day. 
 We'll have that fuel line fixed in no time. 
 Woman : Oh, great. 
 You wanna grab the toolbox?

 As I said, uh, I got it sorted, yeah? 
 But we can fix it now.

 Man 2 : Seems like it, son. 
 Man 1 : Got it. 
 Had to pay to get it winched out. 
 Totally cactus. Absolutely buggered.

 An American chick. 
 She's travelling alone. 
 Man : Bit off the old beaten track out here, old mate. 
 Kane : She's 20-ish. She's got this long blonde hair.

 Long blonde hair?
