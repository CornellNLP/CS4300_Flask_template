 Oh, no, I was just... was just maybe thinking, thought about what I said, maybe grabbing dinner one night? 
 I work nights, Billy. 
 Don't be a smart-arse. Your job is to make 'em feel like a king. 
 All right. 
 Hey, Ange. Bloke who's stalking you is in the bar asking after you. 
 Big hat, check shirt, ugly? 
 Is he asking by name? 
 Description. Skinny blonde, Yank. 
 She's Canadian, you moron. 
 Same difference. 
 You didn't say anything, did you? 
 No. Of course not. 
 What exactly did you say? 
 Nothing. 
 Alls you had to do is say there's no girl like that working here. 
 You got a big mouth, Desiree. Matches your arse.

 You want me to get him facing this way? 
 Let me, Ange. At least I won't give him your name and number. 
 How are we doing?

 I recommend the schnitzel.
