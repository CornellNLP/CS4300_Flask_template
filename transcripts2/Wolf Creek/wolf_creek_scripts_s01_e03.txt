 On an otherwise ordinary night in 2001, "Wilma O'Dell went to the ladies lavatory with a mop and bucket to clean and was struck dumb! A pattern had formed on the floor tiles under the washbasin in the shape of the face of the Virgin Mary." 
 Mum. That night changed her life forever. 
 She had pancreatic cancer, and you know what? 
 Old cheese kicked on for another 12 years. 
 $70.50 for that one, plus GST. We take cards. 10% surcharge on Amex. 
 You must get a lot of visitors. 
 Busload of cancer patients, once upon a time. 
 Not many lately. 
 (VEHICLE APPROACHES) 
 But... there must be a lot of people, not just tourists. 
 Oh, everybody passes through the Madonna sooner or later.

 Armed robbery. 
 Someone got shot. 
 Died. 
 I got convicted for it. 
 But you didn't do it? 
 Left me to do 15 years hard time without parole. 
 You know, if you kill him, you'll just go back to jail anyway. 
 An innocent man died. 
 Doesn't matter he was a jerk. 
 Someone's gotta pay for it.

 Man 2 : Salt Lake Zero 20. We can deal. 
 Man : Got ourselves a Kane Jurkewitz from Kutyukutyu, Western Australia. 
 Dingoes haven't got to him yet, so we're thinking it's still a pretty fresh kill. 
 Ah, maybe less than 12 hours. 
 Kutyukutyu? It's a long way from home. 
 Man : Two suspicious deaths in two days within 50k's of each other. 
 What do you reckon the flower means, Sarge? 
 Could be gang-related. Payback. 
 I'll leave you with it, eh? 
 How's it goin'?

 What do you want this time?

 She might be drivin' a white van. 
 Remembered an Irish girl in a white van. 
 Yeah? 
 Looked like she stuck her head under a lawnmower. 
 What are you gonna do with her when you find her? 
 Good question.
