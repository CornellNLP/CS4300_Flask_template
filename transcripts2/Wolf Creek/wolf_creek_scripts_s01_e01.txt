 (SOMBRE MUSIC) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (US ACCENT) Hey! Missing all the scenery. 
 Well, according to the map, there's a billabong about five miles ahead, so... 
 Ingrid : A what? 
 A waterhole, Mom. 
 Roland : Yeah, it's the perfect camp site. 
 Ingrid : Next town's only another 50 miles away. 
 Roland : Oh, we could do that. We could waste an hour driving or spend the next 60 minutes fishing, swimming, barbecuing... 
 (CHATTER CONTINUES) 
 (MUSIC PUMPS ON HEADPHONES) 
 Oh! What did I tell you guys? Come on. 
 Paradise. How about that, huh? 
 Come on! 
 Roland : Wow! 
 (BIRDS CHIRP) 
 Cool. 
 (INGRID GIGGLES) 
 (ROLAND CHUCKLES) 
 (SINGS) ♪ Hey, little girl, is your daddy home? ♪ 
♪ Did he go and leave you all alone? ♪ 
♪ Mmm, I got a bad desire... ♪ 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 ♪ I'm on fire ♪ 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 What do you say we have a little skinny dip after the kids go to bed? 
 You, me and the mosquitoes? How romantic! 
 I thought you were supposed to be collecting firewood. 
 Yeah, I just got a splinter. 
 Ingrid : Oh, show me. 
 Just need a little Band-Aid. 
 Oh. 
 That's nice, Mom. (LAUGHS) 
 You been into that first aid kit? 
 You touch the painkillers? Did you? 
 Just grabbed a Band-Aid. 
 I just grabbed a damn ban... 
 What else? 
 Nothing else. 
 You're not to go into that first aid kit without me or your mother present. You got it? 
 This whole damn vacation is for your benefit. 
 Don't you forget it. 
 Well, how can I? 
 You raise it every five minutes. 
 Now, you got a problem, miss the sooner you admit it, the sooner you start to recover. 
 Can you just stop about that? 
 You wanna get back on the training track? Ask yourself. 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know? 
 I don't know. 
 Roland : That's fine. 
 You can kiss Tokyo 2020 goodbye and you can kiss my ass while you're at it! 
 Honey, what will you do when you really do need a painkiller? 
 Shut up, Mom. 
 Just stay out of it. 
 (ROARS) 
 Ross  (screams): Mom! Dad! Help! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Roland : Ross! 
 (GASPING) 
 (INDISTINCT SHOUT) 
 Oh, my God! 
 (CROCODILE ROARS) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 Family  (screaming): Ross! Ross! Ross! 
 (SOMBRE MUSIC) 
 Americans, eh? 
 So, what brings you all the way down under? 
 Ross : We're in rehab. Or she is. 
 Ingrid : A vacation. 
 Hmm. 
 We've been promising ourselves a trip to the outback for years. 
 Yeah. God's country, mate. 
 Ha! 
 That was a tasty burger, Mum. 
 (SPITS) 
 What are them... What are them little green bits? 
 Ingrid : Fresh oregano. An herb. 
 Mick : Oregano, hey? 
 That wouldn't be from the US state of 'Or-egon', would it, hey? (CHUCKLES) 
 I speak a bit of American, you know. 
 (IMITATING ROBERT DE NIRO) Ya talkin' to me? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 So, uh, what's your line of work, sir? 
 Me? I shoot pests. You know, feral animals, ah, pigs, donkeys, camels. Tourists. 
 (MICK LAUGHS HEARTILY) 
 (ROLAND AND INGRID CHUCKLE) 
 Mick : Ah, what... what do you do for a crust? 
 Well, I'm a police officer. We both are. Omaha PD. 
 Mick : Police? Hey? Fair dinkum? 
 They... they call you pigs over there, don't they? 
 Not if they know what's good for 'em. 
 Mick : Yeah? Funny. 
 Me being a pig shooter and you being pigs. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Excuse me. 
 What's the matter, love, time of the month? 
 (MICK CHUCKLES) 
 Can I get you another beer? 
 Ah, nah, I'm right, mate. 
 Why don't you tell me about that weapon of yours? 
 Mick : Huh? Yeah, which one? 
 (MICK CLEARS THROAT) 
 This one? 
 Or... this one? 
 Now, that's a knife. 
 (CHUCKLES) Too right it is. 
 (SPRAYING) 
 Oh, God. 
 Is that necessary? 
 Eve : Just trying to kill the smell of him. 
 Ingrid : I know. 
 Are you OK, baby? 
 No. 
 No, I'm not OK. Ross almost got eaten by a dinosaur. 
 I don't know how anyone out there's OK. 
 Your dad only wants what's best for you. 
 That's all he's ever wanted. 
 I'm not going back to the track. 
 Don't say something you're gonna regret. 
 Don't want to do it anymore, Mom. 
 Then what do you want to do? 
 I don't know. 
 Anything but that. 
 Mick : What have you got there? 
 Ross : Silverboy. A gift to Dad from the precinct. 
 Hey, hey! Watch where you're pointing that, champion. 
 Could be a bullet up the spout you don't know about. 
 (HEADPHONES PUMP MUSIC) 
 Put it back in the case, honey, huh? 
 Mick : Well, this old rifle, she ain't pretty, but she can knock over a razorback, buffalo... 
 Croc. 
 Yeah, yeah. Even a 20-foot salty. 
 Knock one over with a single shot. 
 But you know what my weapon of choice is, son? 
 Bowie knife? 
 Too right. 
 And you know why? 
 'Cause it can kill silently. 
 (GASPS) 
 (ROLAND GROANS) 
 Never heard that comin', now, did ya? 
 Dad! 
 Mick : There you go. 
 Argh! 
 Ah! 
 Ross : Dad! Dad! 
 Ingrid : What do... what do you want? 
 Ross : Daddy! 
 Ingrid : Do you want money? 
 Roly! Oh, my God! (GASPS) 
 (MUSIC PUMPS FROM HEADPHONES) 
 (SHOUTING OUTSIDE) 
 You know another thing I like about the Bowie? 
 Is it's got enough weight to throw. 
 Mom, no! 
 (ROSS GRUNTING) 
 Never hurry with a lethal weapon in your hands, son. 
 It's like running with scissors. 
 It's a recipe for disaster. 
 (PANTS) 
 (GUNSHOT REVERBERATES) 
 (MUSIC PUMPS ON HEADPHONES) 
 (MICK CLEARS THROAT) 
 (KNIFE BLADE SLIDES) 
 Well, you can't say you didn't see it coming, eh, love? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 You're in for a bit of a shock, aren't you, girlie? 
 (DARK MUSIC) 
 (MICK CHUCKLES) 
 (DOOR BANGS OPEN) 
 Happy holiday!

 (BIRDS SING) 
 (WATER BIRDS HONKS) 
 (BIRDS SING) 
 (CAMERA CLICKS) 
 (MAN HUMS) 
 Man 1 : Is that... that a red-winged parrot? 
 (CAMERA CLICKS) 
 Man 2 : Does it look like a red-winged parrot? That's a common lorikeet. 
 Man 1 : Oh. Oh, righty-oh. 
 What's that over there? 
 What? 
 In the reeds. 
 Yeah. Where? Is that a body? 
 Come on. Get us over there, man. Get us over there. 
 (BREATHES SHALLOWLY) 
 (LIGHTS HUM) 
 Dr Sheen : So this here, .22 calibre bullet. 
 Shot? 
 In the back. 
 Caused a partial pneumothorax. 
 Collapsed lung? 
 Mm. Bingo. 
 Yeah, somehow, this clever little piece of lead missed all the vital organs and blood vessels, bounced around the rib cage like a pinball and lodged itself there. 
 Fatima : When can I talk to her? 
 Dr Sheen : It's gonna have to wait. She is dosed to the gills. 
 What are you doing after you knock off work? 
 Wife's made plans. 
 And I'm back on at midnight. 
 (BREATHES SHALLOWLY) 
 (LOW MUSIC INTENSIFIES SLOWLY) 
 (TENSE MUSIC BUILDS)

 (BIRDS CHIRPING) 
 (VEHICLE APPROACHES) 
 (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) 
 (HANDBRAKE CLICKS) 
 Good to see you, Sergeant Hill. Real good. 
 Hill : You too, Fatima. How's the girl? 
 Fatima : Yeah. She's healing up well. 
 She's tough. I can say that for her. 
 You got any ID on her? 
 We got... 
 An Eve Thorogood. 
 Mmm. 
 She came in from the States 20 days ago with her family. 
 Oh, at least she was saying the truth about that. 
 What's your gut feeling? I won't hold you to it. 
 Murder-suicide? 
 Most likely, the father killed the mother and the kids and turned the gun on himself. 
 But this one got away. 
 You don't buy her story? 
 What kind of a person is she, would you say? 
 She's pretty. 
 Righto. 
 Hill : Painkillers. They a bit of a problem for you? 
 Your father brought a .22-calibre rifle into the country with him. 
 Had to get an International Visitors Permit for it. 
 Darwin Customs, they logged it on entry. 
 And the doctor here, he just pulled a bullet out of your chest cavity. Same calibre. 
 Are you s... saying that my dad...? 
 Hill : People do crazy things out there in the never-never. 
 No. 
 Locked up in motorhomes for weeks on end, living out of each other's pockets. 
 Something sparks an argument. 
 Gun goes off. All of a sudden, there's bodies on the floor. 
 My dad was already dead... when I got shot. 
 It was... a man. 
 (DARK MUSIC) 
 He had a blue truck. 
 (CLANGING FROM VEHICLE)

 (ENGINE REVS) 
 (ENGINE STOPS) 
 (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 (STAPLES) 
 (STAPLES) 
 (DROPS STAPLE GUN) 
 So where are the bodies? 
 Got taken by dingoes, maybe? Or crocs? 
 No, they would have left us something. 
 Are you sure it's not just a figment of her imagination? 
 Her family's missing. She's got a gunshot wound. 
 Fatima : OK, OK. 
 Hill : There'd be something. Teeth, jewellery or something. 
 Get Forensics down here? 
 Yeah. 
 Whoever he was, he cleaned up his mess pretty bloody good. 
 Hey. 
 You all right? 
 I want to go home. 
 Yeah. 
 Where in the States you from? 
 Nebraska, Omaha. 
 Springsteen. 
 Used to love that album when I was a kid. 
 So did my dad. 
 You got any family you can go back to over there? 
 No, not really. 
 (THUNDER CRACKS) 
 (APPLIES HANDBRAKE, STOPS ENGINE) 
 (THUNDER RUMBLES) 
 (HILL SIGHS) 
 The room's all paid for. 
 Thanks. 
 Grab something to eat and... get yourself a good rest. 
 Pick you up in the morning, eh? 
 Um... 
 Do you think that... you could stay? 
 Oh, it's... it's a protocol thing. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Um... 
 I could see if there's a female officer available... 
 No. It's OK. 
 Are you married? 
 Do you have any children? 
 (THUNDER RUMBLES) 
 Why did he choose us? 
 (LOCK CLICKS OPEN) 
 (FLICKS LIGHT SWITCH) 
 (LOCKS DOOR) 
 (DROPS KEYS) 
 (FLICKS LIGHT SWITCH) 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 Oh, yeah. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Same guy. 
 Could be. 
 But what if it's your girl and you're busy lookin' the other way? 
 Can't see her gettin' rid of three bodies on her own. Can you? 
 How do you know she was on her own? 
 See all these people here? 
 They've all gone missing. Bodies never found. Mostly tourists. Same MO. 
 Same killer. 
 So he's been prowling the outback for decades, undetected? 
 Never leaves a witness. 
 At least not one that speaks any kind of sense. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Hill : What are you doing here? You OK? 
 Sarge, she just walked straight in off the street. 
 Don't know why we pay you sometimes, Abbott. 
 Why don't you get on with it, Sergeant? Have a seat. 
 Sorry, I just can't stay in the hotel room on my own. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Thanks. 
 (HILL CLEARS THROAT) 
 What's that? 
 Missing persons. 
 From the Northern Territory? 
 Queensland, Western Australia. 
 All over. Tourists. 
 Why didn't you tell me that it's happened before? 
 I didn't say murdered. I said missing persons. 
 But he cleaned up the crime scene, right? He got rid of all the evidence. 
 So, doesn't that mean he's done it before? 
 You've probably got him on file somewhere. 
 You a cop? 
 My parents are cops. 
 Can I look? 
 Nuh. 
 I can get you to take a look at a couple of mug shots if you feel up to it, though. 
 Yeah? 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 (SLAMS DRAWER SHUT) 
 Your guy, he could be in here. 
 He's not my guy. 
 Tomorrow after the interview, I'll put you together with a police artist. 
 You can work up a face. 
 What are your chances of tracking down the blue truck? 
 Not great. 
 You playing some sort of game? 
 Beg your pardon? 
 Look! What is... what is that? 
 Hill : Blue Ford F100. 
 Eve : Sky blue. It's the same truck. It's his truck. 
 Snapped 11 years ago in Kutyukutyu. 
 Flyspeck town in WA. About 700-odd miles from where you were. 
 So he could have been all over the country killing people since then. 
 I've come across hundreds of these trucks. 
 Most of 'em are unregistered and untraceable. 
 Why don't you want to catch him? 
 This isn't Omaha. 
 I can't just round up every suspect truck. 
 It's the Territory. People come here to disappear. 
 I want to find whoever murdered your family. 
 And even if the odds aren't great... doesn't mean that I'm gonna stop trying. 
 OK? 
 OK. 
 We'll get him. 
 (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 (MAN SPEAKS OVER TAXI RADIO)

 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

 What?

 Mad bitch! 
 (EVE SCREAMS) 
 (HILL SIGHS) 
 Blue truck parked out back. 
 Belonged to a prawn boat skipper called Ray. 
 He's been working the gulf the last couple of months. 
 Did you check his alibi? 
 Wasn't him. 
 What were you gonna do if it was, hmm? 
 The only witness? 
 You think it's smart to let him know you're still alive? 
 Does that mean that you believe me? 
 That we weren't the first? That he's done it before? 
 Maybe. 
 It's just a theory. 
 Can't prove it. 
 But if we don't stop him, then he's gonna keep... doing it. 
 There's no "we", OK, Eve? 
 Your job's to go home, get better, stay alive. 
 One day, I'm gonna need you to testify. 
 Soon as your new passport's ready, you're on a plane home. 
 You're not gonna find him, are you? 
 It's gonna go in that fat green folder with all the other cold cases. 
 I'll keep you in the loop, all right? 
 Don't worry. 
 Just... good luck, eh? 
 Safe home. 
 It's my fault. 
 Hey, come on. No, it's not your fault. 
 If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't have come here. 
 My dad brought the whole family here so that I could get better. 
 (EXHALES) 
 Never even told him how much I love him. 
 He would have known. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah.

 Hi. Is... is Sergeant Hill here? 
 Yeah? 
 You just missed him. He's gone to lunch. 
 Oh, he-he just told me to come in and sign something. 
 I-I'm gonna drop it on his desk. 
 Hang on. 
 Where you going? 
 Forgotten my wallet. 
 I can lend you some cash. 
 Hill : Ha! Couldn't afford the interest, mate. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 You got a visitor, Sarge. Uh, blonde American girl? 
 Far out!

 Woman : You looking for a van?

 Um... 
 See that one, the yellow one? 
 Colour of sunshine. Symbolises energy and warmth. 
 Eve : It's a pretty cool colour. 
 Where you headed? 
 I don't know yet. 
 Just gonna, um... follow my nose. 
 (VEHICLE DRIVES AWAY)

 Yeah!
