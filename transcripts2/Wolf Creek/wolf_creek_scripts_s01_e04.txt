 Woman : Help! My arm! 
 Who the bloody hell are you?! 
 My arm! 
 Oh, more tourists. 
 Where you from? 
 Sweden! Help! Please! 
 Oh, shut the f*ck up! 
 That's better. 
 (VEHICLE APPROACHES) 
 Oh. 
 (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 Kirsty : Hey. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Thanks. 
 Kirsty : Hey... I, um... thought we could grab a bite and, you know... 
 I'm busy. 
 Sully, I'm... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It was... 
 It was just a dumb mistake. 
 But you have to admit, things have been pretty shitty between us for a while. 
 (SULLIVAN SIGHS) 
 Come on. You're always at work. 
 You don't want to spend any time together. 
 I'm trying, Sully. 
 Can you? 
 Just... not here, OK? 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 (CHATTER ON RADIO FROM OTHER VEHICLE) 
 (CHATTER) 
 (APPLIES HANDBRAKE) 
 (DOG WHIMPERS) 
 Woman : There you go, love. 
 Man : Thank you. 
 (MEN CHAT) 
 Man : Thanks, love. Cheers. 
 (FLY BUZZES) 
 (DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN) 
 Eve : Hi. 
 Uh, my uncle's working around here. 
 I just flew in from the States. I want to surprise him. 
 Would you be able to tell me where he's working? 
 Man : Miner, is he? 
 Eve : He's a pig shooter. 
 No-one's shootin' pigs around here now. 
 Not till spring, till the bastards breed up again. 
 You sure? I'm certain he said he had work in Opalville. 
 Not this time of year, he doesn't. 
 Thanks. 
 (CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (DOG PANTS) 
 (WHINES) 
 Eve : Holly Welles. 
 Disappeared from Opalville, South Australia, April 2012. 
 (APPLIES HANDBRAKE) 
 (STOPS ENGINE) 
 (DOG WHINES) 
 (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 Eve : Mrs. Welles? 
 My name's Eve. 
 I'm a journalist. 
 How are you doing? 
 I'd love to talk to you about your daughter, Holly. 
 I'm investigating unsolved disappearances in the outback. 
 I understand your daughter's a missing person? 
 We don't get a lot of visitors. 
 Who'd you say you write for? 
 Eve : Oh, I'm freelance. 
 (WIND WHISTLES) 
 Would you be happy to tell me what happened? 
 (SNIFFS) I was the last one to see Holly. 
 She got a job in Broome and... the police and the authorities, they're not looking for her anymore. 
 Everyone's forgotten her. 
 Sorry. 
 That's why it's important to keep it in the public eye. 
 Remind the police that there's people who still want justice for her. 
 I've got a doctor's appointment in town. 
 Could I maybe talk to your husband? 
 OK. 
 Come on. 
 Jason was really devastated when Holly went missing, yeah? 
 He spent months looking for her. 
 He hardly ever comes out of the dugout now except for deliveries. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 Mrs. Welles : Jason! 
 Jason! 
 This young lady's a journalist. 
 She wants to do a story about Holly. 
 Eve : Thanks for your time, Mr. Welles. 
 What's the point in raking up the past? 
 Well, she says it might help to get the police interested again. 
 Eve : Yeah... I mean, I can't guarantee anything, but the police often move on too fast from cases like this, and... hoping it might bring some attention back to it. 
 Won't bring her back. 
 Um, was there a particular suspect or... any sightings of a vehicle? 
 They reckon that, um, whoever it was must have taken her from the bus stop up on the highway. 
 Bloody holiday job in Broome. 
 If she hadn't encouraged her... 
 I gotta go to my appointment. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Yep. 
 Bit young for a journo, aren't ya? 
 I know how hard this must be for you. 
 Jason : That's enough to kill 12,000 guinea pigs. 
 Makes antivenin. 
 You like snakes? 
 Holly couldn't stand 'em either. 
 Did they think that the person who... took Holly was a local, lived locally? 
 Did they issue a description of any suspects or... or a vehicle? 
 Your wife said you... you spent months searching for her. 
 Um... What did you do? 
 Posters. 
 Public appeals. 
 Searches. 
 And how did you prioritise? Did you... 
 I just drove. 
 I drove. 
 I drove all over. 
 Did you come across a tall man driving a blue truck? 
 A sky-blue truck? 
 What are you really doing? 
 I'm, um... I'm following up a theory that... a lot of disappearances in the outback are linked. 
 Aren't your parents worried about ya? 
 Out here on your own? 
 Haven't talked to them for a while. 
 Let's have a cup of tea. 
 (LIGHT HUMS) 
 (LIGHTS BUZZ) 
 One minute, she's wearing fairy wings and a ballet dress. 
 Then she's announcing she's leaving. 
 Moving away. 
 (SIPS TEA) 
 Oh, she never wanted to move here in the first place. 
 My business went bust. 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 You gotta provide for your family somehow. 
 Want some of this? 
 Oh, no, thanks. 
 Yeah, good girl. 
 I always used to fret when Holly went out drinking. 
 She just didn't realise what a dangerous... place the world is. 
 You know, how vulnerable she was. 
 I bet your dad's just like me. 
 Overprotective? 
 (HESITANTLY) Yeah. 
 And I bet you're just like Holly. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Telling him to butt out. It's your life. 
 Kind of. 
 You know, if only you girls realised... we dads just want what's best for our little princesses. 
 We love you so much... (PUTS CAP ON BOTTLE) ...when we lose you... it's like dying. 
 (PUTS BOTTLE DOWN) 
 Just wish I could talk to my dad. 
 Well, call him. Patch things up. Say you're sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 I'd ask him if he thinks what I'm doing is right. 
 If I'm doing it the right way. 
 Jason : She wouldn't listen to me. 
 (SHOUTS) She never listened to me! 
 All the way to bloody Broome. Broome! 
 If she wasn't so bloody stubborn! 
 I'm her father! 
 I know what's best for her. 
 And then I saw her on the road and... and I couldn't believe it. 
 You saw Holly? 
 At the bus stop? 
 After I... I dropped her off? 
 I... I don't understand. 
 What did you do to her, Jason? 
 (SHOUTS) What did you do to her?! (SHOUTS) 
 It wasn't my fault! If you hadn't encouraged her! 
 (GROANS) 
 (DARK MUSIC) 
 You're not gonna write any of this.

 (BIRDSONG) 
 (INSECTS CHIRP) 
 (EVE STARTLES) 
 (GASPS) 
 How'd I get here? 
 Well, I didn't carry you. 
 I had a dog. 
 Mutt's got more dingo than anything else. 
 (BARKS) 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Won't get far with that bite still in you. 
 Thought I was gonna die. 
 Woulda done if I hadn't happened along. 
 You followed me? 
 Why? 
 Who you really looking for out here? 
 It's just someone. 
 You've seen a demon. 
 (DARK MUSIC) 
 (APPLIES HANDBRAKE, STOPS ENGINE) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (BOTTLES CLINK) 
 Couldn't get that miracle of yours out of my head. 
 I was here the other day. 
 If you say so. 
 I was looking for an American girl. 
 No Yank's been in. 
 How about this bloke? You have another think about him? 
 Nope. 
 You know what? I'm gonna take one of these with me. 
 Should've taken one the other day. 
 Bernie : Not for sale. 
 Take one of these, then. 
 The only thing for sale's this whole business. 
 You know how long it's been since I seen the ocean? 
 The city? Been anywhere? 
 15 years, I've been waiting for a bloody apparition. 
 Mum probably made the whole thing up. 
 Hey, it's really important. 
 You take a look at this and you tell me. 
 She's in a lot of danger. Please. 
 There was an Irish girl here, not long ago. 
 Looked a bit like that. 
 Could have been her? 
 I don't know. She had short hair, like a boy. 
 She had a bee in her bonnet about some fella in a blue truck. 
 Blue truck? 
 Yeah, the fella owed her. 
 I sent her after a pig shooter in a blue F100. 
 Come to think of it, not a million miles away from that ugly coot. 
 Did he say where he was going? 
 Opalville. 
 Opalville. 
 Here. 
 By the looks of it, you need it more than me. 
 Thank you. 
 Man : You chucked this like you knew what you was doing. 
 I used to javelin. 
 You ever heard of a woomera? 
 A spear-thrower. 
 Eve : No. 
 Man : Right. 
 Have a look at this. 
 Eve : Huh! 
 (EVE LAUGHS) 
 When I first got here, you said I looked like I'd seen a demon. 
 Yeah, well, uh, we got plenty of demons out here. 
 Trouble is, uh, what ya gonna do about yours? 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 Yum. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Hey, Dog! 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 He thinks so too. 
 Ha! 
 (EVE LAUGHS) 
 Time to go. 
 I thought he'd killed you. 
 He killed himself. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 (WIND WHISTLES) 
 I found your gun. 
 The police have it. 
 Your fingerprints aren't on it. Just Jason's. Only his. Yep. 
 And I found her. 
 I should thank you for that. Thank you. 
 I can say goodbye... at last. 
 (CRIES) 
 I can say goodbye and move on. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SNIFFS) 
 So you're leaving? 
 Yeah. 
 There's nothin' much for me here now. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 Mrs. Welles : You don't want a vehicle, do ya? 
 That old thing of Jason's? 
 Woman : Two takeaway schnitty specials. 
 Danke. 
 South Africa? 
 German. 
 Ah! 
 Willkommen to God's own, love. 
 Danke. 
 Oi! 
 (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) 
 What are you doing here? 
 Get in the car. 
 He knows you're following him. 
 Eve : But the country's too big. We won't cross paths, remember? 
 Sullivan : You're not gonna survive out here. 
 You're not equipped for this. 
 You have no idea. 
 Hey. Hey! 
 Let me go. 
 Woman : Are you alright there, love? 
 Sullivan : It's alright. I'm a police officer. 
 Eve : I haven't done anything. 
 That bloke in Kutyukutyu who ended up dead. 
 You gonna plead the Fifth on that one? 
 You got no passport. You got no money. 
 Your visa's gonna run out in a couple of weeks. 
 You'll be a bloody ghost, off the grid. 
 That's yours. 
 Not going without him. 
 He's not sitting in the front. 
 Oi! 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 Sullivan : Eve! Oi! 
 (METALLIC CLANG) 
 Sullivan : Stop! 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 Hey! 
 Come on! 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (BARKS) 
 Sullivan : Hey! Argh! 
 Argh! 
 (PANTS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (CAR ENGINE STARTS) 
 (FLY BUZZES) 
 We could drive all over this country and never find him. 
 (DOG WHINES) 
 I have to go where he goes. 
 Rome. 
 Find a waterhole where all the animals come to drink. 
 (MOANING) 
 (MOANING) 
 (MICK SIGHS) 
 Oi! 
 You asked me what I was gonna do with this Yankee Sheila. 
 I don't know. 
 (GASPS) 
 Oi! 
 Oi! 
 Give us a kiss. 
 (BREATHES SHALLOWLY) 
 (BUZZING) 
 Wow. (LAUGHS) 
 Woman : A dragon. I love it. 
 (BUZZING)
