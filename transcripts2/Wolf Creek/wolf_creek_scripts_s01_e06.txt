 Takes away men's souls. 
 But you won't find him in the Bible proper. 
 He's apocryphal. Just a story. 
 Just a story. 
 Could you... 
 Could you give me a blessing? 
 Well, yeah, OK. 
 May God protect your going out and your coming in now and forever. 
 Amen. 
 Uh, Missy. 
 My old dad didn't have much time for religion. 
 But above our front door, he'd hung this saying. 
 "May the road rise up to meet you. 
 "May the wind always be at your back." 
 Eve : Ahh! 
 Priest : "May the sun shine warm on your face. 
 "And the rain fall gentle on your land. 
 "And until we meet again...
