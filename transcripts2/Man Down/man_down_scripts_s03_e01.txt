 I've really turned a corner since you left. 
 The teaching's going great. 
 I'm positive, so the kids are positive. 
 Wow. Well, I mean, it's only been six weeks but I really am sorry that I didn't come out here earlier. 
 New York must be a pretty lonely place, I bet. 
 Probably, but I'm in Boston. 
 I might apply for deputy head. 
 He hasn't replaced you, so why not, eh? 
 A man can dream. 
 You hate teaching! 
 The head's more likely to appoint a bee. 
 Anyway, Dan, look, it's gone four in the morning here in Boston and... 
 Should've said! I did. 
 I do every time you call. 
 And I assume that they still do the Friday nine o'clock meeting? 
 Yes, and? 
 It's 9:10. I know. 
 I can see the head arriving late from here. 
 Hey! 
 Yeah, you tardy bugger! 
 Time do you call this? 
 You f*cking knob! 
 Cor. 
 You are! 
 Ah. No, he's good as gold now with me. 
 Right. You're clearly still in your bed at your mum's house. 
 You're probably in your pants. And do you know how I know that? 
 Because the last time I was there, I stared at that Tizer stain on your ceiling for four hours while you lay next to me and snored. 
 Emma! Goodbye, Dan. 
 Emma! 
 Daniel, you're late. I need to get these windows open. 
 Oh, dear. The whiff you create! 
 Get out of my room, old woman. 
 You can't wear those again. I can do what I like! 
 Should I get another pail of cold water? 
 Get your trousers on, boy! 
 We don't want to see your messy rabbit. 
 Good God, the stench in here. 
 It's like a popped boil. 
 And, clearly, our graffiti artist is back. 
 So, should you hear anything about their identity or, indeed, if you spot a member of staff licking a dog's bulb, let me know. 
 (They laugh) 
 Seriously, though, let's get this kid caught. 
 Doesn't look good for visitors. 
 Now, then, happier matters - teacher of the week. 
 Who gets a handful of headmaster's jelly treats this Friday? 
 Think we all know who it won't be. 
 (They laugh) 
 So, for her wonderful Young Enterprise event on... 
 ..on Wednesday afternoon, Miss Charman. 
 OK, have a great weekend. 
 Mr Davies, there's a note I don't want you to miss in your pigeonhole. 
 My...? 
 Whoa. Those are new, aren't they? 
 Headmaster! 
 Headmaster... 
 Little mouse! 
 You dropped your sweetie. 
 Oh, sorry, Mr Klackov. 
 Wait, it's litter. 
 Do you know what a sweetie on the floor attracts? 
 Erm... 
 The fox. 
 And you know what a fully grown fox is capable of? 
 Oh, God! 
 Don't drop sweetie on my floor and make litter, little mouse. 
 Women! 
 They are messy. 
 It's a disciplinary hearing, sir. 
 All : Oh! 
 About time. He might just want to talk to me about the drama budget, no? 
 He doesn't give a sh1t about drama. I heard him say. 
 It's the same note he gave Mr. Callaghan before he got sacked. 
 Callaghan tried to sell a boy in France. What have I done? You're always late. 
 You set fire to Robin's hair. You locked Karen in the cupboard. 
 I think it's when you got us drunk. 
 I didn't get you drunk. You stole that from my office. 
 And a whole class shouldn't be able to get hammered on one box of wine. 
 It's pathetic. Shame Miss Lipsey isn't here to bail you out any more. 
 Shame you're never going to get married. 
 Says the man who lives with two old ladies. 
 Your mum's got a new boyfriend now, hasn't she? 
 No. She has. I saw them playing bowls together. 
 Oh, well, they must be banging, then, mustn't they? Grow up. 
 Right. Go on, get on with your work. I need to think. 
 What work? Make up a play. 
 About what? I don't know! 
 Homelessness, Aids, whatever. 
 Not Aids again. I'm going to be a ninja. 
 With Aids. 
 "You don't have a father, Jo. 
 "I just decided to be pregnant, and I was. 
 "So, you're capable of... 
 "Yes. I can self-fertilise. 
 "I saw no reason to doubt her, so I never asked about Dad again." 
 Jo, no-one is going to buy your autobiography. 
 Why is it blank halfway through? 
 I'm not dead yet, am I? 
 Anyone who buys a book can come to me in the future and I'll write the next bit in. 
 You're insane. 
 Tache, what's this letter? 
 How should I know? 
 You're a bloody school governor. 
 I'm heading up the digitisation of school finals. 
 I have nothing to do with staff matters. 
 And even if I did, I wouldn't get involved. 
 It's called conflict of interest. 
 I pretended to know what Brian was talking about by nodding hard. 
 When you're next in, you've got to have a peep at my personal file, tell me what I've done. I'm in school tomorrow. 
 Saturday? Yes. 
 Everyone has their guilty pleasures. Mine happens to be data entry. 
 But I'm not going to be divulging any information from your file. 
 Here, I'm your mate, sure I am. 
 But as soon as I step over that threshold, I am Governor Ames. 
 Good day! 
 He's almost done it, hasn't he? Just like he said he would. 
 Since Julia left, he's almost become 100% pure Brian. 
 It's chilling. I thought you hated teaching. 
 I hate my cock and balls, Jo. 
 Shall I snap them off? 
 My job's all I've got left. 
 Listen, if there's a file with all the bad stuff in it, why don't you just get rid of it? 
 They can't sack you without evidence. 
 Jo smiled. She realised she'd said a really great thing. 
 For inspiration. 
 Yeah, I wouldn't bother. 
 It's f*cking sh1t! 
 Oh! You're getting slow, old girl. 
 You seen my laptop? I need to skype Emma. 
 Stop phoning her in the middle of the night. 
 You're like a horny mongrel, Daniel. 
 I need to ask her advice. 
 I've been called in by the head. 
 What? You can't afford to lose your job, Daniel. 
 I mean, technically, you're almost homeless. 
 You're not far from being a giant human rat. 
 And you know what we do with rats. 
 Yes, I get the message. 
 We shoot them in the mouth. 
 Don't tell Mum. 
 (Door shuts) 
 (Voices) 
 She hasn't brought that bloke home? 
 It's been a long time, Daniel, and your mother has needs. 
 She can't spend all her free time in the en-suite, thumbing her pudding. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Nesta, we were just... 
 Oh, Daniel. You're home early. 
 Aren't I? 
 This is my son, Daniel. 
 This is Daedalus. 
 But everybody calls him Daddy. 
 Not everyone. 
 Hello, lad. 
 He's in trouble at work, Polly. 
 Nesta! Oh, Daniel. 
 Teaching's all you've got now Emma's left. 
 Emma? Who's Emma? 
 His old boss. Silly boy should have squired her but, no, he let her slip through his fat fingers. 
 There was that one night before she left. 
 Do you mind? A goodbye knee trembler before leaving the country? 
 That's hardly a solid foundation. 
 For God's sake. 
 He's got no money, no children. 
 Probably a Jaffa. 
 Never even had a scare. 
 He hasn't. Lack of testosterone. 
 His armpits are bald, and now, no job. 
 Right. Thanks for that, you Shih-Tzu-faced hags. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 Daedalus. 
 Mmm. Unusual, a young man talking to his elders like that. 
 In my day, he'd have felt the hairy side, but not my business. 
 I'll put the kettle on. 
 Oh, no. I wouldn't have that at all. 
 
 
 
 Mr Klackov! 
 What you do in school? 
 You forget - it's Saturday! 
 Like a stupid kid! 
 Hey, pigeon brain! 
 It's Sa-tur-day! 
 No, no. I... 
 I just bought you a present. 
 Why? 
 Are you fizzy in pants for a man? 
 Oh, no. 
 I've heard there's a key. Ah. 
 Klackov's magic key, eh? 
 (He chuckles) 
 You want to get into headmaster's office? 
 Yes. 
 Come. My office. 
 Come. 
 Office? 
 Hardly the f*cking Pompidou Centre, is it, mate? 
 Bleurgh! 
 Eugh, piss. 
 You ever try Serbian rakia? 
 Oh, it tastes like a lady's... 
 Erm... How do you say...? 
 Oh, erm... 
 Fanny? 
 Tears. 
 You been Serbia? 
 No. Do you miss it? 
 It's a place of great pain. 
 I can never return. Oh. 
 It's my family. 
 Oh, lovely. All dead. 
 Ah. 
 I like you. 
 Tell me, how many years have you taken? 
 How many... Years have you taken? 
 How old am I? Yes. 
 45. Ah. 
 And Klackov? 
 Oh, I wouldn't like to... 
 Come on. Come on. Come on, pretty boy. 
 How many? 
 65? 
 No! 
 (He laughs) 
 Whoo! 
 72. 
 (He laughs) 
 Hurray! 
 (Eastern european music plays) 
 Come, dance. 
 No, I... I... I couldn't. 
 Do you want a magic key for piss wide? 
 No, never. 
 Dance! 
 (Mr klackov hums) 
 Your plump friend, your nutty, crazy broken head. 
 Jo? 
 I like her. 
 You bring her to me. Yeah. 
 I'm not a pimp, mate. 
 Oh, not a pimp? No magic key for you. 
 No. 
 Oh, OK. Yeah. 
 I'll speak to her. 
 Fine. You'll probably get on very well, actually. 
 She used to be a part-time cleaner, so... 
 You say Klackov is cleaner? 
 Part of your job, isn't it? 
 You insult me, you insult my dead family?! 
 You think my sons are dogs? 
 Or beggars? No. 
 Cleaners? No! 
 No magic key for you! You think headmaster run this f*cking school? 
 Eh? 
 Klackov run this f*cking school! 
 Out! Go on, get out. 
 Whay, ha-ha-ha! 
 You're mad. Ha-ha-ha-ha! 
 You're f*cking mad! 
 (He cackles) 
 Now what? Can I suggest you read chapter 34 of my autobiography? 
 It's blank. Yeah. 
 You want that file? 
 We break in and steal it, Ocean's Impossible style. 
 Here's how I see it going down. 
 I distract the guard at the front gate, disguised as a bush, and then stealthily infiltrate the facility using my cunning disguise. 
 Pearce patrols the perimeter to check for the headteacher whilst I attach giant springs to my feet. 
 Your mum somersaults over the rear fence and busts out her ninja stance. 
 Pearce keeps watch for Nesta while she takes out the three guards with tranquilliser darts, which leaves me free to bounce into the window like a f*cking frog and... Jo! 
 What the f*ck are you on about? 
 All made sense in my head. 
 I'll come up with the plan. 
 Who did the map for you? Dennis. 
 The cheeky little twat. 50 quid. 
 He's lucky I didn't grass him up. 
 What for? It's obviously him doing all the graffiti, isn't it? 
 How else does he know how to break in? 
 Right. Let's get this over with. 
 Oh. You...will need these. 
 What's this? They're walkie-talkies. For insurance. 
 Stay here. And maintain radio silence unless absolutely necessary. 
 (He breathes heavily) 
 (He wheezes and strains) 
 (Fence creaks) 
 Ohh! 
 (He grunts) 
 Agh! Oh... 
 (He retches) 
 (He retches) 
 (He retches) 
 Arggggh! 
 (He strains) 
 (Music plays faintly) 
 (He gasps) 
 I like this. 
 Oh, right. 
 Thank you. It's thick... down there too? 
 I... It springs. The hair! Pfff! 
 Under your hand. 
 You break anything in here, you will have to answer to Krakow. 
 Righto. 
 (He hums a tune) 
 (He strains) 
 (He strains)

 (Sweets rattle) 
 (He strains) 
 (He sniffs) 
 I thought I knew that stench. You're not taking that file. 
 Not on my watch! 
 What does it matter to you? 
 It's school protocol. A school needs order. 
 (They shout) 
 Argh! 
 Urrgh! Uh! 
 Argh! 
 (Moustache rips) 
 ARGH! 
 (Objects clatter) 
 (Fire alarm blares) 
 Dan! 
 Dan! 
 Just take it. Run. 
 He's insane. 
 Away from here. I'll take the hit. 
 Ha! 
 (Wheels squeak) 
 Ha! No! 
 No! What the...? 
 Ohh! 
 (Wheels squeak) 
 Argh! 
 (Fire alarm continues) 
 (Fire alarm stops) 
 Come out! 
 Come out! 
 Krakow want to play! 
 You forget Krakow's magic key! 
 And no-one insult the Krakow name! 
 Well done, my fat friend. 
 The police are coming! 
 Dan! What are you doing? 
 There's no escape! 
 Dan, you've got to get out of there! 
 Krakow run this f*cking school! 
 Yeah-ha-ha! Ah-ha-ha-ha! 
 (Maniacal laughter trails off) 
 What am I doing? 
 'I thought you hated teaching. You hate teaching. The head's more likely to appoint a bee!' 
 Of course! 
 Of course! 
 (Thud) 
 Fox! Argh! 
 (Fox snarls ferociously) 
 Argh! Fox! 
 Argh! Biting! 
 Agggh! 
 (School bell rings) 
 The disciplinary wasn't that serious. 
 You really don't need to resign. 
 Look, mate, this has been a long time coming. 
 I should never have become a teacher. 
 I'm not good. I will never be like Miss Sharman. 
 It's time to move on. 
 My aunt thought goose fat would get it off, but it hasn't. 
 Yeah. It stinks, doesn't it?
