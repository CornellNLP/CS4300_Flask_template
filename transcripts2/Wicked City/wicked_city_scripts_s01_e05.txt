 Previously, on "Wicked City"... 
 I've never felt closer to anyone. 
 Baby, you used to love getting down on your knees for me. 
 Get out of my house. 
 [Bang on window] 
 The cops knew where and when to hit us. 
 I'm not a rat. 
 It's time to cut loose ends. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Let's see if you can do better. 
 The victims that he targets, the way he kills them. 
 He's killing his mother, over and over again. 
 Man : It's 5:30 A.M. in Los Angeles, and already, 78 degrees outside. 
 Looks like today's gonna be the hottest day of the year. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 You have to go. 
 I do? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I've got to get to work. 
 Really? 
 You got the early shift today, huh? 
 Oh, I got every shift now that Bucket's... gone. 
 Graham has me working at Enzo's on The Strip... the new club? 
 Fancy. 
 Guess that's one way to keep people working hard... blow their co-workers' brains out. 
 Well, don't worry. I'm gonna have Graham behind bars in no time... and his boss. 
 I have no doubt. 
 So you'll keep your eyes open for buyers with fancy cars? 
 Let me know if something pops up? 
 You think that's the key? 
 The killer drives different high-end cars? 
 Now if I can figure out why, it might just get me something. 
 Well, we know he's probably stealing them, 'cause a guy like this isn't buying them. 
 Yeah, but wh-why is he using them... all those different cars? 
 It's not to blend in. They're vintage. 
 People notice. Yeah, that's weird. 
 Someone like this probably wouldn't want to bring attention to himself. 
 Right. And he hasn't... not since he was about 9 years old. 
 Check this out. 
 This is the only visual I have on him. 
 That's the killer? 
 Cute kid, huh? 
 I wonder if he knew what he'd become... 
 If he felt the darkness. 
 [Sighs] 
 I knew I wanted to be a cop. 
 Yeah? Me too. 
 I used to wear my brother's toy gun and holster everywhere. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I would have loved to see you as a little girl. 
 Well, I would've kicked your ass. 
 Yeah? Oh, yeah. 
 All right, get out of here. 
 We both got work. 
 Betty : But I never want you to leave. 
 But I have to. 
 These cars won't reupholster themselves. 
 I wish they did. 
 I'm so happy with you. 
 I feel so safe. 
 And you are. 
 But I can't always be there, you know? 
 Of course. 
 I got you something. 
 Safety first. 
 Honey, I love it. 
 Ah, yes. 
 You want me to cube you, McClaren? 
 Yeah, right. 
 Diver, we're the fourth estate. 
 A little professionalism? 
 [Door opens] 
 Hey. 
 I got something for you... the Hollywood Slayer as a kid. 
 So? Why'd you bring it to us? 
 First name's Cooper. 
 Should be about 28, 29 years old right now. 
 He looks so sweet. 
 You two are gonna run a story on Baby Slayer there. 
 "Are monsters born or made or... " 
 All that crap you do. 
 "All that crap." 
 With the picture front and center, plus the tip line, we're hoping somebody recognizes him. 
 So can I count on you guys? 
 No. 
 Sure. 
 We're halfway there. 
 You want to let the cops force us into writing a piece? 
 It's a huge scoop. You just hate Jack Roth. 
 I don't hate him. 
 Just that Dudley do-right won't play... all take, no give. 
 Hey, hey. Excuse me. 
 How about I take you downtown? 
 Jackass. 
 Fine, but I want something in return. 
 Getting greedy, man. 
 I've been looking for Bucket, that guy you popped a week ago. 
 Dude's been missing ever since. 
 Since when do you care about drug dealers? 
 Since the killer cares. 
 The Hollywood Slayer plants "fly brand" coke on his victims. 
 That's what Bucket sells. 
 At least that's what I've been told, anyway. 
 Now, that's for calling my work "crap," brother. 
 You gave him that? 
 I had to trade. 
 I mean, how do you think we found Bucket in the first place? 
 Just make sure the photo runs front and center. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Let me see that. 
 Hi, there. 
 Hi. 
 Man, nice wheels, huh? 
 Looks expensive. 
 Sure. 
 Jimmy Lovett. 
 Uh, neighbor. 
 You live around here? 
 No, I'm just, uh, visiting. 
 Excuse me. 
 Oh!

 See ya. 
 Yeah, I'll see ya.

 [Indistinct talking] 
 Hey, Betty. 
 [Sighs] 
 What a nice surprise. 
 Is it really? 
 Kent : Hi, there. 
 Hi. 
 Hey, babe. 
 Jimmy, it's nice to see you again. 
 You've met. 
 Yeah. That's nice. 
 Jimmy is... here with his kids. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, over there. 
 Yeah, little one's a real wimp. 
 Yeah, well, most children model their behavior on the same-sex parent. 
 I got to get these out of the sun before they melt. 
 Mm, see ya. 
 So that's your new boyfriend, huh? 
 Um, it's none of your business. 
 Well, I think it is. 
 Our kids play together. 
 I'm guessing he's gonna be around a lot. 
 You know, we don't want a bad element in the neighborhood. 
 What are you saying? 
 Oh, come on. Like you didn't know. 
 Different cars every day? 
 That Jag, the Fury, the hours he keeps. 
 Whoo! [Laughs] 
 Yeah, it took me a while, but I finally figured it out. 
 Your hunk is a drug dealer. 
 [Laughs] 
 He's a drug dealer? 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 And I can't have no dope pusher coming into this neighborhood. 
 So I'm asking Ron to look into it. 
 Ron? 
 My cousin in the LAPD. 
 You called the police? 
 Mm-hmm. Ron'll look at Kent hard. 
 Everything... his work, his home. 
 Man has secrets. 
 They got a way of coming out. 
 Jimmy, Kent is not a drug dealer. 
 Maybe that's what he's telling you, but do you think the police will believe you didn't really know? 
 Probably not. W... shoot. 
 I wonder if they'll take your kids straight away or will they give you a hearing or something. 
 No one's taking my kids anywhere. 
 Kent's dirty... they'd be stupid not to look at the girlfriend, right? 
 Maybe arrest her, get her to testify. 
 That's when Child Services swoops in. 
 [Laughing] 
 Whoop! 
 But hey, look. I just wanted to warn you, 'cause I'm always looking out for you. 
 'Cause that's what friends are for. 
 You know what else friends are for? 
 Just being sweet to each other. 
 Mmm. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 One night of fun, Betty... 
 Then I'll leave you and your boyfriend alone. 
 I'll tell your wife. 
 [Laughs] 
 It wouldn't be the first time. 
 Mm. 
 So tonight, around 6:00... my place. 
 Wife'll be at work. 
 [Moans] 
 [Smooches] 
 Here's the paper you like. 
 Thanks, Dave. 
 I don't know why you like looking at all that gore when the new Playboy just came out. 
 Find this world intriguing. 
 So, uh, different from ours. 
 Guys, whoa.

 [Phone rings] 
 Paco : Hey, Jack, some chick in the Valley is claiming she knows your guy Cooper. 
 So this is the Cooper that you knew in junior high. 
 Do you think the news stations want to talk to me too? 
 Ma'am, the photo. 
 Yeah, yeah. That's Cooper Flynn. 
 "Flynn". You sure about that? 
 Do you want to hear the story or not? 
 Of course I'm sure. 
 I had to sit across the kitchen table from his geeky face for like a month. 
 He tutored me in science class. 
 Okay, so Cooper was a smart kid? 
 If by smart you mean "loser," yes. 
 I was a finalist at the Los Angeles cheerleader championship in seventh grade. 
 I had other things going on besides the periodic table, you know? 
 I bet you were amazing. 
 I still am. 
 Now, you say that he tutored you at his house. 
 Yep. 
 What do you remember about that? 
 His grandfather smelled like pee and mothballs. 
 And Cooper built those stupid model cars. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Finally, a real lead. 
 Yeah. 
 Flynn... an actual last name. 
 Okay, I'll put Bukowski on it... see if we can get a social or birth certificate. 
 And don't forget, we now know he was a loser who built model cars. 
 You know, there's nothing wrong with building model cars, okay? 
 It promotes discipline, focus. 
 Give me Bukowski, ASAP. 
 Man : Yes, sir. 
 You get a message from diver... 
 Hoping you'll give him another valuable piece of evidence? 
 You know, we would've never found Bucket had it not been for that trade. Remember that. 
 Yeah, well, diver's looking for a dead man. 
 You know, Graham offed him... right in front of Diane. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Damn. 
 Yeah, well, that guy's a maniac anyway. 
 Nah, this was just, uh, family stuff. 
 My wife... soon to be ex-wife... 
 I told her that I can't pick up my kids tonight, and she's not too happy about that. 
 How long's it been? 
 Well, we've been separated over a year now. 
 Not my choice, but definitely my fault. 
 Let me guess... you're hard to live with. 
 I have my demons. 
 Don't all cops? 
 Yeah, only mine affected my son. 
 He has night terrors now. 
 That sucks. 
 You know, we think that the selfish things that we do to cut loose, just get out of our own head, that it won't affect us. 
 We control it, but... then we lose the thing that we actually need... our family. 
 [Whistling] 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hello and good evening. 
 Hi. You sound chipper. 
 You're not worried about that article in the paper? 
 That picture is of you, isn't it? 
 I... I didn't know your name was really Cooper. 
 You know, I always preferred Kent. 
 I thought it sounded cool. 
 Plus, it's what you call me. 
 That's why I never told you. 
 Don't worry about the story. 
 It doesn't matter. I promise. 
 So what are you doing tonight? 
 I'm gonna be watching "Love Boat"... a little "Fantasy Island" if I'm feeling adventurous. 
 Well, don't be too adventurous without me. 
 Never. 
 So, you coming over? 
 Probably not. 
 Depends how long this project takes. 
 Sometimes these things can get a little messy. 
 And Betty, about your friend Jimmy. 
 He's not my friend. 
 Well, he was, though, right? 
 I mean, you guys dated. I could tell. 
 Look, it's okay. 
 I just don't think he's very good for the kids. 
 That's all. 
 I don't really care for him. 
 [Sighs] Neither do I. 
 I don't care about your past. I care about your future. 
 Kent. 
 You know I'd do anything for you. 
 Likewise. 
 Anything. 
 I'll see you.

 Jack : So, how was the concert, honey? 
 Sting is a god. 
 I seriously think he looked at me. 
 Well, you know what? I'm sure he did. 
 How can you hate a band called "The Police"? 
 [Chuckles] Uh, because they're not. 
 Well, this may be your last concert pick-up, because in three months, I'll be driving myself. 
 Three months? That's not possible. 
 No. Your... your math is off. 
 What? 
 Three months?

 15 years and 9 months ago... when I was born?

 Don't say "chill," Dad. 
 That's totally geeky coming from you. 
 Oh [Chuckles] totally. 
 And don't worry. 
 You can take Mom to a concert, like, I don't know, Barry Manilow. 
 Try Zeppelin. 
 Look, three months... I'm driving. 
 18 months... I graduate from high school, and in two years, I'm off to college.

 Up next, "Overload" by Talking Heads. 
 This is from Randall to his main squeeze, Leila. 
 Why do people do these dedications? 
 I mean, h... how do they even know the person is listening? 
 Because you tell them to. 
 You set the whole thing up so they're right there listening when the song comes on.

 ♪ Terrible signal ♪ 
 Jack : The radio dedications... like "for Emily F., from your secret admirer"... the killer is with the women when the dedications come on. 
 Okay, so what. 
 So, we called the radio station, and the timelines match exactly. 
 I mean, just think about it. 
 The Slayer, he leaves the club with the victim, drives her in his car, she hears the dedication... 
 Then he kills her in that car. 
 So it's a big honking mess. 
 Exactly, that's why he needs all these different vehicles, because they're trashed afterwards. 
 All right. Miller and I will get back into the stolen vehicle reports. 
 Okay, I'll take used car dealerships. Junkyards? 
 Sure, give the Mexican the scrap yards.

 Okay. What's next? 
 Well, me telling you how he does it. 
 I think I figured it out. 
 All right, so after the Slayer kills these women, obviously he's leaving one hell of a mess. 
 So if he's not junking the cars, he must be repairing them. 
 So what if he does that for a living? He's a car restorer. 
 Takes the customer's car... uses it for the kill. 
 And afterwards, he pulls all the bloody stuff out and he replaces it with brand-new seats, a new dash... the works. 
 Detective. 
 Call back. 
 And then he charges you top dollar for it. 
 Now, Slayer's grandfather... he upholstered furniture, so we're thinking maybe the guy picked up a few tips. 
 This is L.A. How many shops we talking about? 
 We got 31 total listed businesses. 
 There are probably way more, but we'll start there, work our way down.

 I'm here because of me, but... it's sweet that you care. 
 I'm glad I stayed. 
 And not just for the story. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, okay, then. 
 Sorry. I... I slept here last night. 
 Don't be sorry. 
 You got to stay with me until all this is over. 
 I mean, if... if that's all right. 
 Man : Right here, fellas. Here's the office. 
 Jack : Thanks. 
 Whose desk is this? 
 Kent's a cool manager. 
 Hard work. Clocks in early every damn day. 
 That makes sense. 
 See, he kills girls in your customers' cars, and then he swaps out the bloody seats for brand-new upholstery. 
 To do all that, you'd have to... you'd have to get in early.

 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Sorry, I probably should've called to remind you, but I've got that job interview. 
 I don't mind, Gloria. 
 It's... I just had a couple of things on my mind. 
 Okay, thank you so much. 
 Come on. 
 Bye, sweetie. 
 Love you. 
 Love you, too. 
 See ya. 
 Bye. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. 
 You know what? 
 It's so hot, I think we should have ice cream. 
 Kent, it's not even lunch. 
 Ice cream for everyone.

 Man : 225 yards rushing today, simply guaranteeing the state victory. 
 Tech has no answer for him defensively. 
 Announcer : And now for your local Los Angeles news, here's Jason Brown. 
 Brown : Sources tell K.A.B.C. the LAPD is moving in on the Hollywood Slayer. 
 His tragic victims were all young women... 
 Vera Bennett, Emily Fuentes, Mallory Kharchenko, and a potential victim now identified only as Natasha. 
 Detectives are working off of clues found at various crime scenes, and there may be a break in the case. 
 And from Washington, at 9:00 A.M. this morning, President Reagan... 
 Chocolate and strawberry. 
 [Sighs] 
 Isn't strawberry your favorite? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yeah. 
 And I have approved... 
 Are you okay, Kent? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 [President Reagan continues indistinctly]
