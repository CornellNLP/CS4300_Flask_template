 Previously on "Wicked City"... 
 I know it's you. 
 You're the Hollywood Slayer. 
 Well, I guess now it's my turn to pay for what I've done. 
 I like what we have. 
 Let's not make this into something it can never be. 
 Oh, wow. Ain't that a thing? 
 Big climax. The explosion. 
 Far more cinematic, don't you think? 
 Your guy here set himself on fire. 
 He must have spread it around the house, too. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Cooper : You know I hate to see you cry. 
 [Gasps] 
 They said you were dead. 
 I have so much to live for because of you.

 [Sighs] What am I, drooling? 
 [Chuckles] No. 
 You're here, but I just can't remember the last time you were actually in this bed when I woke up. 
 Well, you may have to get used to it. 
 So, is the case closed? 
 Does this mean you're gonna be coming back from Barone's tonight stinking like cigars? 
 Oh, you better bring me and Vicki back a few slices. 
 No, I don't think there's gonna be any Barone's tonight. 
 But that... that's where you usually go when a big case ends. 
 That's what you do with Vince. 
 Is this because you don't like Paco? 
 No, no, he's actually he's all right. 
 He's pretty smart. But, um, just not sure there's anything to celebrate. 
 Why? 
 'Cause I'm not sure the case is over. 
 But they found the body, right? 
 In that house when it burned down? 
 Yeah, and everybody assumes it's our guy, but... 
 Everyone but you. 
 Right. 
 Well, if I was a betting woman, I'd put my money on you. 
 Yeah? How much? 50 cents? 
 Oh, at least a dollar. 
 Well, I'm... I'm honored you have that much faith in me. 
 If you say it isn't over, it isn't over. 
 [Sighs] But I sure wish it was. 
 Yeah, I know. I know this has been hard on you. 
 On us. 
 Look, it's our life, Jack. 
 I know that's never gonna change. 
 But it'd be nice if you were here more... present. 
 It'd give us a chance to just... be. 
 Hmm. 
 I know. 
 Karen : I can't believe he's a cheater. 
 Diver : I can't believe he's so careless. 
 Man's a police officer. 
 Keep it in your pants until you get inside. 
 So what should we do? 
 Know that Mr. Clean's a little dirty and enjoy it. 
 No, I meant what should our angle be for the piece. 
 We're not writing about this. 
 I don't even know why I took these photos. 
 I... I see something seedy, and I can't even help myself. 
 Why not? 
 With the slayer dead, this could be a big story. 
 It's an affair. It's nobody's business. 
 It's the people's business. 
 The lead detective on a case where cocaine was found on the victims is having an affair with a cocaine dealer. 
 It might have affected the investigation. 
 Maybe... maybe he didn't look enough into the connection between the coke and the killer. 
 Detective Contreras told you he always left fly brand on his victims, right? 
 What if he didn't focus enough on that? 
 Well, the slayer is dead. 
 So it seems like it wasn't an issue. 
 In another day or two, the coroner's going to discover that the body in the fire isn't mine. 
 Of course the charring will only burn the subcutaneous tissue. 
 The stab wounds will still be there. 
 You... are so sexy when you talk medical. 
 Oh. 
 A sexy nurse. 
 Is that cliché? 
 Not when it's you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 If dental records are provided, the body will be I.D.'d very quickly, and our situation will change fast. 
 Jimmy's pathetic wife will definitely report him missing, instead of being grateful he's gone. 
 Idiot. 
 We need to stay ahead of this. 
 Right now we have the element of surprise. 
 We need to use that to our advantage. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 "When the enemy is relaxed, make them toil. 
 When they are full, starve them. 
 When they are settled, make them move."

 Karen : I'm just gonna say it. 
 Without the slayer, this town just got a lot more boring. 
 Diver : You didn't think the opening of the new hot dog stand was exciting? 
 Karen : If that's what I have to report on, I'd rather be dead. 
 After eating that, we might just be. 
 I'm heading back out. 
 Not for another one of those hot dogs. 
 No, for a real story... 
 About Jack Roth and his drug dealer mistress. 
 There's something there... you'll see. 
 I know it. 
 Well, if you find a news-worthy story, I'll print it. 
 Done. 
 ♪♪♪♪ 
 [Dialing] 
 Yeah, it's Roth. 
 Anything on our burnt-to-a-crisp corpse? 
 Well, that's fine. What's taking so long? 
 I hope this is a priority for you guys. 
 He is a big ray of sunshine your partner. 
 Yeah, about that. 
 A cranky son of a bitch. 
 Nothing you can do about it. 
 You might consider assigning me my own cases. 
 You ready to abandon the Roth ship so soon? 
 Look, this was a huge case, Captain. 
 I kept my head down, I did the work. 
 I think I deserve to take on my own cases after this one. 
 My money was on you jumping ship within five days with Roth. 
 But you've handled it. 
 And got the job done. 
 But you've got drive. 
 You got balls, too, coming in here before we even know the case is officially over. 
 Well, success only comes when preparation and opportunity meet. 
 Yeah. I'm not one for fancy quotes. 
 But here's one... here's one you might have heard. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Don't count your chickens before they hatch. 
 So I'm guessing that's a no. 
 No, that's just a wait and see what the coroner comes back with. 
 'Cause if by some small chance this is not our killer, you've just laid your cards on the table too soon. 
 Now, how's that for fancy. 
 [Slurps] 
 [Sighs] 
 Vicki. 
 Can I get some help? 
 Honey. 
 Victoria. 
 [Music playing softly] 
 Vicki? 
 And here I thought you were just ignoring me. 
 I was listening to a mix tape Mitch made me. 
 A mix tape, really? 
 Yeah, just some cool songs to inspire me and Daisy as we work on our music. 
 Huh. 
 And how's, uh, how's that going? 
 It's pretty cool. 
 We're mostly gonna sing covers, but I'd really like to write some of my own stuff. 
 Um, no, I meant, how's it going with Mitch? 
 Are we gonna pretend that you're not totally freaking out that I have a boyfriend? 
 So Mitch is your boyfriend? 
 Mom, please don't. 
 Look, it's just I... [Sighs] 
 Mitch is a senior, okay? And I worry. I... 
 I was your age not too long ago. 
 [Sighs] 
 Please don't give me the "wait until you're married" speech. 
 Well, considering that I didn't, I certainly wouldn't expect you to. 
 Really? 
 Is this icking you out talking about this? 
 No, I'm... I'm glad you had a life before Dad, that you were something before you were my mom, I don't know, Dad's wife. 
 I'm still my own person, honey. 
 I know. I didn't mean it like that. 
 Look, look, I want you to be your own person, too. 
 I want you to make good choices. 
 And s*x can have consequences. 
 Yeah, I would use protection. I'm... 
 I'm not interested in being a teenage mommy. 
 Then that's... That's very good. 
 Um, but other kinds, as well. 
 Like you can think, "oh, it's just s*x." 
 And then you can fall for the person. 
 Or it can make the relationship too intense. 
 I just... I want you to be prepared for all of it before you actually do. 
 So, what we doing for lunch? Pink's? 
 Ah, no, the line will be too long. 
 Well, we got the time. 
 What's this? 
 Hey, Jack! 
 We got it. Coroner's report is in. 
 And? 
 Well, unless this guy stabbed himself 14 times, he's not the killer. 
 That body was dead long before the fire. 
 Mm. 
 Looks like it's lunch at our desks, and we're back to square one. 
 Not if we can figure out who this victim is. 
 We find him, we have more leads that might lead us to the killer. 
 All right, well, I'll check with, uh, missing-person reports. 
 Yeah. 
 And I'll put out an APB on our elusive killer, whatever the hell his name is. 
 Yeah, I'll be right up. 
 ♪♪ 
 Hey, what do we got? 
 Well, we know that son of a bitch hid his scent when he fled his house. 
 Otherwise, the dogs would have smelled him, and dogs always smell vermin. 
 Well, he probably poured the kerosene he used to blow up the house on himself, and the dogs wouldn't have followed that. 
 What about our... our crÃ¨me brÃ»lée body? 
 What does he tell us besides crispy on the outside? 
 14 stab wounds. 
 Around the neck area? Consistent with our victims? 
 Some... mostly the ribcage. 
 Really? 
 So, an unplanned killing, one with a lot of emotion. 
 Maybe the victim surprised him. 
 He had to kill him. 
 Okay, the stab wounds were on the ribcage on the left side angling slightly up, so if our killer was left-handed, he could have come at him from behind. Or the victim could have been on top of him as he was being stabbed. 
 So our victim attacked him. 
 Maybe. 
 I'm gonna go pull some missing-persons reports. 
 And, uh, the coroner said that they'd be here any minute with all the gory details. 
 Okay. 
 I just got off a highly unpleasant call from the chief. 
 He's not happy. 
 Was he worried he might have to kiss more mayor ass to keep his job? 
 We have to release a statement and announce that we did not catch our man. 
 Contreras, you're stuck with a partner a little while longer. 
 Looks like none of us gonna get what we want today. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 What's that supposed to mean? What... you didn't mention to Roth your move to get your own cases? 
 Contreras : Look, I only mentioned that now that the investigation was over, that maybe I could take the lead on my own cases. 
 That's all. 
 Let's just stay focused. 
 Right. Of course. 
 I'll coordinate with Bukowski on the missing-persons files, check for dental recs. 
 I'll wait for the coroner.

 Dianne, it's Jack. It's urgent. 
 I'm gonna page you. Please call me back.

 Dianne : Can I help you? 
 I hope so. 
 My name's Karen McClaren. 
 I'm a reporter with L.A. Notorious. 
 Not sure I needed your name or what you do for a living to pour you a drink. 
 I'm not here for a drink. 
 Then I can't help you. 
 Do you not want to talk to me because you're a drug dealer? 
 Or because you're having s*x with a cop? 
 Is that your angle for a story? 
 That people have s*x and sell drugs on the Strip? 
 Hope you're not trying to make money as a reporter. 
 Kind of stating the obvious. 
 Most drug dealers don't have s*x with cops. 
 Most cops aren't that cute. 
 One too many doughnuts. 
 You know, he's married? 
 Are you trying to write a story or pass judgment? 
 I'm trying to figure out if Detective Roth's judgment was impaired by being involved with you. 
 He handled some pretty big cases. 
 Yeah, he does. 
 And somehow I think catching the Hollywood slayer is a bit more important than who he goes to bed with. 
 Well, since the killer blew himself up in a fire, I'm not too worried about that. 
 You're not much of a reporter. 
 Been all over the news. 
 The psycho faked his own death. 
 I have to... I have to go. 
 Maybe try working on those investigative skills, like turning on a TV.

 [Ringing] 
 So, the rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. 
 And Jimmy's about to be discovered. 
 Okay. 
 So, now that the cops know that I'm alive, we need to cover our tracks. 
 We need to make sure those who are looking for us are too distracted to stay focused. 
 And how do we do that? 
 I'm working on the latter already. 
 And as to the former, you need an alibi for the night Jimmy disappeared.

 Drinking buddies, family, people he worked with. 
 Work colleagues, even neighbors...

 No, he's not left a note or nothing. He... 
 Well, that's because he didn't leave something. 
 He took something. 
 I don't understand. 
 The killer sent these photograph to Jack. 
 ♪♪ 
 A bunch are missing. 
 He must have broken in. 
 Now what I want to understand is why you took them and how. 
 I was looking for Bucket, and they said that this chick... 
 Dianne. 
 That she was the replacement, so I followed her. 
 Why you still looking for Bucket, man? 
 Because the killer leaves fly brand coke on his victims. 
 That's what you told me. 
 That's what Bucket dealt, so I... I figured it was a lead. 
 Okay, so... so the information I gave you about fly brand coke is the reason why Jack's affair is gonna be exposed? 
 I'm sorry, man. 
 And now Dianne may be at risk if the killer decides that she's useful to him. 
 I've been looking all over for her. I can't find her. 
 I could tell you where she lives. 
 How? 
 It's where I took the photos. 
 Good.

 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I'm, uh, sorry to barge in on you like this.

 It's the killer. He knows about you and Jack. 
 May even know where you live. 
 [Sighs] Does he know I'm a cop? 
 Look, I don't know, but I know that you're not safe here. 
 All right? Jack's been trying to find you all day. 
 Where you been?

 Hello. 
 Kent : Kiki. 
 Hello... 
 What should I call you? 
 John's fine. It's a biblical name. Strong. 
 I'm surprised to hear from you, John. 
 Since last time you used me to fake your own death. 
 Don't be angry. I needed to protect myself. 
 You understand that. Anyway, look, I've got this big scoop for you to make up for it all. 
 It involves Jack Roth and a certain girlfriend. 
 Since you stole those photos from here, you already know I'm aware of the fact that Detective Roth is having an affair with a drug dealer. 
 Yeah, but that Dianne has so many layers. 
 And once you peel them back, what you will find is an undercover police officer. 
 She's a narc? How do you know that? 
 Well, I may be your source, but I have my own. 
 And what a juicy story that would be. 
 You get to expose the inner workings of the L.A.P.D.... 
 A world of narcs and police officers that fall in love with them. 
 That's a sexy exposé. 
 If I printed that, her cover would be blown. 
 She would be in real jeopardy... maybe even killed. 
 Well, perhaps there would be blood. 
 But I can't control what people do with information. 
 You mean you can hurt her and Jack Roth without getting any blood on your hands. 
 Not that it's ever seemed to bother you before. 
 The greatest victory is that which requires no battle. 
 And I'd be very careful how you speak to me, kiki. 
 I'm only human after all.

 My Jimmy's dead. 
 I heard. 
 He brought his truck to that auto shop. 
 The police think he must have walked in on the serial killer cleaning out one of the cars he killed a girl in. 
 [Voice breaking] That crazed monster took my Jimmy from me. 
 You know, who the real monster is? 
 Pam. 
 It's Jimmy. 
 You think we didn't know he beat you, but we all did. 
 All the black eyes, the bruises on the kids' arms. 
 He didn't mean to. Sometimes... 
 You should be happy he's gone.

 You deserve a man who loves you and respects you. 
 Every woman does.

 I just keep going back to his mom, you know, and the fly brand coke on the bodies. 
 You know, why that? 
 Maybe his mom's drug use? 
 Yeah, sure, but, uh, why fly brand? 
 Maybe there's something he wants you to see in that world. 
 Go see Calvin at the Whisky. 
 He's a bartender there. He deals fly brand. 
 Maybe he knows something. 
 Calvin? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That'll be great, yeah. 
 I mean, that's... that's where he met Emily and Karen, so maybe this guy sold to him. 
 Thanks.
