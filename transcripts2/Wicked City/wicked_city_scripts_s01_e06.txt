 Hi, Karen McClaren. 
 Tell Jack Roth I said "hi." 
 We are doing this. 
 You gonna be mine from now on, baby. 
 No! 
 What we do is special. It's unique. 
 You betrayed me. How do you not see that? 
 Dave : Kent clocks in early every day. 
 To kills girls in customers' cars, you'd have to get in early. 
 I write my R's backwards, and he never makes me feel bad about it. 
 Detectives are working off of clues found at various crime scenes, and there may be a break in the case. 
 Reporter : It's another gorgeous day in Los Angeles. 
 In the news headlines, there's a big break in the gruesome Hollywood Slayer murders. 
 There are a lot of rumors that the LAPD have a subject of interest. 
 Also in the headlines, trouble seems to be brewing at...

 Jack : We have our suspect, Cooper Flynn, also known as Kent Grainger. 
 Got a very bloody piece of fabric that may tie one of our killer's victims to his job at Edgeway Car Upholstery. 
 Getting close. 
 Any luck running the killer's name through the DMV database? 
 No, I didn't come up with anything. 
 Zilch. Nada. No Kent Grainger. 
 Well, that's nada-helpful. 
 Bukowski, the red Corvette give us anything? 
 All tech found was a thing of, uh, Tic Tacs, and then multiple prints, none of which are in the system. 
 No identity on file, which means no address. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, we're hoping the owner of the shop has it. 
 Yeah, where the hell is he? 
 Eileen : I finally tracked him down. 
 He was on his way to Big Bear for a family vacation. 
 I've got a black-and-white escorting him here now. 
 Jack : What about the two knuckleheads who work for him? 
 T.J. and Dave? 
 Uh, on their way. 
 What's with the pimp-daddy shoes, man? 
 Oh, these are limited edition, uh, Stacy Adams. 
 Our manhunt good-luck charm. 
 Arnie : Exactly. 
 10 chases, 10 arrests. 
 All a little before your time, Paco. 
 Here's hoping we get to the chase. 
 Well, I just hope you got a canary-yellow zoot suit to match, Huggy Bear.

 Paco : So, how long did Cooper Flynn work at your auto shop? 
 I... I don't know him by Cooper Flynn, only Kent Grainger. 
 You got an address to go with that name? 
 [Sighs] You know, I... I got a copy of his I.D. with his address on it in here somewhere. 
 Where do you send his checks to? 
 It's an all-cash business. 
 An all-cash business that clearly requires a trapper keeper organizer. 
 Got it. Thank you. 
 Well, Kent attracted a lot of women like bees to honey. 
 Yeah, I mean, more like moths to flame. 
 Not his fault. Chicks dig him. 
 I just figured it was the bike. 
 He drove a motorcycle? 
 Yes, a Bonnie. '76. Blue. Beaut. 
 Nice. 
 Yeah. 
 Did our guys bring the trash from the garage? 
 It's right there. 
 Hey, when was the last time your trash was picked up? 
 Week or so ago. I don't know. 
 God, that smells like my second ex wife's pumpernickel bread bowl. 
 You guys, pick out your trash. 
 What? 
 Jack : Pick out what you personally threw out, please. 
 Who do those Hobie's ice-cream wrappers belong to? 
 Kent. Had one most every day. 
 Hobie's ice creams. Write that down. 
 Found it... the xerox of Kent's I.D.

 Well, maybe 'cause we're just special.

 Okay. Oh, and if there's an emergency...

 [Door opens, closes] 
 Oh, I picked the wrong time to go on a diet. 
 What do you got? 
 Well, checked with the DMV. 
 The killer hasn't registered the Triumph Bonneville motorcycle. 
 Nothing? Of course. 
 And, uh, no surprise, the Addy on his I.D. was bogus. 
 Fake address to go with the fake name. 
 Blurry, but the I.D. looks legit. 
 Figure out where the guy procured it. 
 Yeah, Miller and Bukowski are digging up forgers the killer could've used. 
 In the meantime, we're gonna get the fake name out there. 
 If he went by "Kent" at work, maybe other people know him.

 No, I kind of have a standing Tuesday golf game with my dad. 
 You have a dad? 
 Yeah. 
 A dad who makes you wear that stupid getup? 
 No, not him, but his country club.

 Yeah, he got some ice cream from Hobie's the other day, and when he went to pay, he realized he... he didn't have the money, so he walked out. 
 You should tell him to come clean, go back and pay them. 
 Since... since he didn't get caught, he thinks he doesn't have to. 
 It's like I always say, you got to tell the truth, Mary.

 And with Jack, it's personal. 
 Really? How so? 
 He lost his mother when he was young. 
 Hmm. 
 And now it's like he has to save people to make up for his own loss. 
 I'm just not sure anything will ever fill that void. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh... [Chuckles] 
 And you came here to try to sell color sticks. 
 I'm sorry. Way too much information. 
 No, not at all. 
 I'm parched. 
 Could I trouble you for a glass of water? 
 Oh, my god. I can't believe how inhospitable I've been. 
 Yes, of course. I'll be right back. 
 Oh. 
 [Inhales deeply, clears throat] 
 Make sure you call me if any of your employees recognize him as one of your regulars, okay? 
 All right. 
 You know, I don't know how many more of these tips I can listen to, Jack. 
 I mean, these people are complete whack jobs, and the other half are obnoxious kids who are calling to make prank calls. 
 Are most of the kids boys? 
 Of course, and they all think a serial killer is hilarious. 
 Any of them give an address? 
 Well, sure, if the address has "Uranus" in it. 
 There was that one little girl. 
 Yeah, there's been a few girls. 
 The tape of... of... of the girl with the killer sitter. 
 Cue that up again. 
 Yeah, what are you thinking? 
 [Tape rewinding] 
 I don't know. 
 Mary : The man that you're looking for... 
 Kent Grainger? 
 I know where he lives. 
 He's my babysitter. 
 I live at 2003 Dover Road. 
 That's what I'm saying. I already ran that down. 
 The address doesn't exist. 
 There's no 2003 Dover Road. 
 Play it again. 
 All right. 
 [Tape rewinds] 
 The man that you're looking for... 
 Kent Grainger? 
 I know where he lives. 
 He's my babysitter. 
 I live at 2003 Dover Road. 
 2003. 
 The envelope that was sent to Karen... the killer used a kid to write the address. 
 This little girl... maybe it's her handwriting. 
 What if she's dyslexic? 
 She gets her letters backwards, maybe her numbers, too, like her address. Try, um... try 2300. 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 [Computer beeps] 
 Uh, negative. 
 What about, uh, 2030? 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 [Computer beeps] 
 Bingo. 
 This has got to be it. 
 There's a Hobie's ice cream right nearby. Let's go. 
 Well, it's so nice to have girlfriend time for a change. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Nancy, until you came by today, I forgot how much I missed it. 
 Need it. 
 Life-affirming, almost. 
 [Chuckles] 
 For me, too. 
 You know, this was a perfect afternoon. 
 Good luck with Vicki, and... 
 I have a feeling we'll see each other again. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Thank you. 
 [Chuckles] Thank you. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Police. Open up. 
 Hi, young lady. Are y... are you Mary? 
 He's not a bad person. 
 Hey. 
 Listen, you did the right thing by calling us. 
 Can you tell us where he lives? 
 Gloria : Mary? 
 What's going on? 
 Ma'am, I need you to keep her inside. 
 Keep the doors locked. 
 Stay away from the windows, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 [Explosion] 
 Man : Yeah, he's going door-to-door right now. 
 Sift through it. 
 Guys, he wants... 
 [Chatter] 
 Man : Fire department says your guy here drenched himself in an accelerant and set himself on fire. 
 Based on the heat damage, he must have spread it around the house, too. 
 So, suicide, huh? 
 Yeah. Nasty way to die, but given the grace he showed his victims, it's well-deserved. 
 How long until you have confirmation it's him? 
 Uh, a few days. 
 Call as soon as you know something. 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Tapping] 
 Could you move it along, please, ma'am? 
 We're trying to keep the street clear. 
 [Van door closes] 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Hey, the, uh, search dogs pick up anything? 
 No, they had his scent up until the backyard, but then they lost it, so looks like our guy never escaped the fire. 
 We found his motorcycle in the garage, all burned up, but there was no evidence of any of our victims, charred or otherwise. 
 Ah, that could just mean his kill lair was somewhere else, right? 
 Eileen : I talked to Kent's neighbors. 
 They said he kept to himself. 
 Yeah, well, with the exception of Mary and her mother. 
 I talked to the social worker. 
 She says the mother and daughter are still in shock. 
 Sure. 
 The sad gist of what I could gather from Mary is that Kent was a great babysitter. 
 Well, I guess even horrible people do good things sometimes. 
 I guess we're 11 for 11. 
 [Laughs] 
 Those shoes are still ugly, Bukowski. 
 [Eileen laughs] 
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
 In an unexpected yet exciting turn, the Hollywood Slayer has eluded justice and has taken his own life. 
 [Johnny Osbourne's "Fally Lover" playing] 
 [Crying] 
 [Sighs] 
 ♪ I gave you my heart and I gave you my soul ♪ 
♪ and now you gone and left me cold ♪ 
♪ I'm merely asking for you to come on down ♪ 
 [Sobbing] Cooper: You know I hate to see you cry. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Sniffles] 
 They said you were dead. 
 You know I could never do that to you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 To us. 
 I have so much to live for because of you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I saw the body. 
 Your little mistake came in handy. 
 Jimmy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Better together than apart. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 [Indistinct singing] 
 Man : That was "Fally Lover" by Johnny Osbourne. 
 And in the news, Angelenos can rest easy tonight as the Hollywood Slayer's murderous summer comes to an end.
