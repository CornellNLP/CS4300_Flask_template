 Previously on "Wicked City"... 
 You may need time. I know that. 
 But I have faith in us, Betty. 
 Jack : Coroner's office came through with an I.D. on our Jane Doe. 
 Vera Bennett. 
 Maybe she was his first kill. 
 This kid had to be in her life. 
 Enough that someone would remember him. 
 He was around 11 when Vera met him. 
 His mother had passed away. 
 Remember this kid's name? 
 Cooper. 
 I have a drug dealer to bust. 
 You're a cop. 
 Paco : This killer's just using you. 
 Karen : He's choosing me. 
 Cooper : You've got the right stuff, Karen McClaren. 
 I think I know where Mallory's body is. 
 ♪♪ 
 What do we know about our killer? 
 We know who he kills. 
 We know how he kills. 
 [Woman screaming] 
 Let's focus on the why. 
 We know his first kill, Vera, was a crime of passion, right? 
 It was... it was fueled by the sting of rejection of unrequited love. 
 She was different. 
 An accident in his mind. 
 So why did he keep killing? 
 [Sniffs] 
 Jack : What drives him now? 
 Rita : How about a movie? 
 You know how much Mama loves the movies. 
 So much that you named me after matinee idol Gary Cooper. 
 That's right, my sweet Cooper. 
 [Smooches] 
 Someday, baby, we'll go to the movies, and you'll see me up on the big screen. 
 All I need's my big break. 
 I'll go to all your pictures, Mommy. 
 Mm, my biggest fan. 
 [Smooches] 
 The speed of the kills, the increased brutality, the... the... the need for recognition... that all speaks to a void that no body, no woman will ever fill. 
 That kind of psyche has deep roots in early-childhood trauma. 
 So let's... let's go over what we know about his primary parent... his mother. 
 Well, it's not much. 
 Rita Forrester... she O.D.'d in '64. 
 Based on the profile, that puts the kid at about 8 or 10. 
 And so far, the neighborhood he lived in with his grandfather hasn't gotten us much, not on her or the kid. 
 All right, guys, well, look, if we could find a way to connect his past to his present murders, then we might be able to find him. 
 So can we please just dig up everything we can on Rita Forrester? Thank you.

 Serial killers rarely use drugs. 
 It hinders their ability to be in control and have power. 
 Considering what we know about Mom's drug use, could be into the party girls. It's oedipal. 
 Sure, so maybe he's buying the drugs to lure them, but clearly, he's leaving them on purpose. 
 I mean, obviously, Mallory wouldn't put her coke in another bag to keep it from getting wet. 
 He wants us to see them. Why? 
 And both times fly brand coke. 
 That's right. Fly brand coke. 
 Three words I'm really starting to hate. 
 So we find the pusher that's selling to him. 
 Yeah, that would help. 
 But we need to make sure every street boss and every fly brand dealer on the Strip sees that composite of our killer.

 Male reporter : Reporting from the Sunset Strip, we have an exclusive interview. 
 Female reporter : Karen McClaren is here to speak candidly about the Hollywood Slayer, the latest serial killer terrorizing Angelenos. 
 Got her right here. She's met him. 
 As a freelance journalist... [scoffs] this must be quite an overwhelming experience. 
 "Freelance," my ass. 
 Tell me, what was it like first meeting the killer? 
 Honestly, he just seemed like every other charming guy on The Strip hoping to make it with a girl. 
 Why choose you to tell his story? 
 I'm not sure, but in his first letter, he said that we have a connection. 
 And maybe that's true. 
 What kind of connection? 
 "To make a name for ourselves. 
 To make a difference." 
 I... I guess he saw I was ambitious. 
 An appeal to your ego. 
 Does it make you uncomfortable to make a name for yourself on the back of a serial killer? 
 It's not about me. 
 It's about the victims. 
 I want to make sure people remember them... their... their names and the lives that were lost.

 Rather than haul his ass in, we're gonna get an invitation to his house.

 We hit each spot. 
 Grab the cash. 
 And then we let them know if they want their money back, we'll deliver it to Graham in person.

 You're upset. 
 Well, well-done, Sherlock. 
 And... and I'm drunk.

 Okay, that's... that's... 
 That's not why I'm here. 
 Sometimes, I think I hate you.

 Not because I don't want you or need you. 
 Only 'cause I do.

 No, went out looking for Bucket. 
 No dice. 
 So, Rolling Stone. 
 When will I be buying a copy to read your genius? 
 You won't. 
 I turned them down. 
 I thought that was your dream... 
 Rolling Stone.

 Why be a small fish in a big pond... 
 When I can just be me... 
 In a pond with you? 
 McClaren. 
 They only wanted the story, not my voice. 
 I want more. 
 You let me tell the stories I care about. 
 There's nowhere else I'd rather be. 
 We're a good team.

 Who's that? 
 Your mother. 
 That's not her. 
 It may not be how she started out, but that's how she ended up. 
 You're a liar. 
 I always knew she was no good. 
 Killed her mama day she was born. 
 Sins like that don't go unpunished. 
 You're a liar! 
 You're a liar! Take it back! 
 You look! 
 Look! 
 Now, I'm not the liar! 
 You remember that! 
 She promised. 
 She promised me she'd come back for me.

 You really should meet my beautiful boy.
