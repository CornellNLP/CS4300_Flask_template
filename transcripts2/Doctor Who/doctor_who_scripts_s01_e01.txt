 EXT. SPACE 
 Camera pans over the planet Earth and zooms right into London. 
 INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM 
 Continue zooming into Rose's alarm clock, which reads 7:30. Rose smacks it to stop it beeping and jumps out of bed. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 Rose picks up her bag, gives her mother a peck on the cheek and grabs her keys. 
 ROSE : Bye! 
 JACKIE : See you later! 
 Jackie sips her tea and picks up the phone. 
 INT. STAIRWELL 
 Rose runs down the stairs of the block of flats where she lives. 
 INT. LONDON STREET 
 Rose jumps off a bus. 
 INT. HENRICKS, SHOP FLOOR 
 Rose carries a pile of clothes, looking rather bored. 
 EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE 
 Presumably in her lunch hour, Rose and Mickey sit next to a fountain, having a laugh, eating, teasing each other and kissing. They get up to leave. 
 ROSE : Bye! 
 INT. HENRICKS, SHOP FLOOR 
 She is shown back in Henricks. 
 LOUD SPEAKER : This is a customer announcement: The store will be closing in five minutes. Thank you. 
 Rose is about to leave. 
 SECURITY GUARD   (hands her a package) : Oi! 
 Rose takes the package looking non- too- happy and enters a lift. 
 INT. HENRICK'S, BASEMENT 
 When the lift pings, she alights in the basement. 
 ROSE : Wilson?  (Goes further down the corridor).  Wilson, I've got the lottery money. Wilson? ( Knocks on a door that says "HP Wilson CEO").  You there? Look, I can't hang about 'cause they're closing the shop. Wilson!  (To herself) : Uhh, come on! 
 There is a sudden sound further along the corridor. Rose immediately snaps her head in the direction it has come from. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Hello? Hello, Wilson, it's Rose. Hello? Wil... Wilson? 
 She stops outside a fire door for a moment, and then opens it, and find herself in a room that looks as though it is used for storing shop dummies. She turns the light on and walks further into the room. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Wilson? Wilson? 
 She tries another door at the side. The fire door through which she entered closes abruptly. Shocked, she runs back and shakes the handles, but they will not open. There is small sound from behind her. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Is that someone mucking about?  (Goes back into the room).  Who is it? 
 Behind her, a dummy slowly turns its head of its own accord. Rose turns around just in time to see it step out of its alcove and towards her. She backs away slowly. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Heh... You got me, very funny. 
 The dummy says nothing and does not stop advancing. Two more join it. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Right, I've got the joke! Who's idea was this? Was it Derek's? 
 The dummies still advance. Another comes from behind. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Derek, is it you? 
 All of the dummies are now alive. Rose backs up away and trips over a box. She quickly pulls herself up again and backs against a wall. The dummy lifts its arm to strike her. Rose screws her face up ready for the blow, when a hand grabs hers. Rose opens her eyes and snaps her head to look at the owner of the hand. 
 A MAN, THE DOCTOR : Run! 
 They run, just in time, through a fire exit. The dummies are in pursuit. The Doctor leads her into a lift. 
 INT. HENRICKS, LIFT 
 The doors close on one of the dummy's arms. The Doctor pulls it off and the doors close. 
 ROSE : You pulled his arm off! 
 THE DOCTOR : Yep!  (Tosses it to her) : Plastic. 
 ROSE : Very clever, nice trick! Who were they then, students? Is this a student thing or what? 
 THE DOCTOR : Why would they be students? 
 ROSE : I don't know... 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, you said it! Why students? 
 ROSE : 'Cause... to get that many people dressed up and being silly... they gotta be students. 
 The Doctor grins. He likes her. 
 THE DOCTOR : That makes sense! Well done. 
 ROSE : Thanks. 
 THE DOCTOR : They're not students. 
 ROSE : Whoever they are, when Wilson finds them, he's gonna call the police. 
 THE DOCTOR : Who's Wilson? 
 ROSE : Chief electrician. 
 THE DOCTOR : Wilson's dead. 
 He steps out of the lift. Rose follows him. 
 INT. HENRICKS, CORRIDOR 
 ROSE : That's just not funny, that's sick! 
 THE DOCTOR : Hold on!  (Pushes Rose to the side).  Mind your eyes. 
 He disables the lift with his sonic screwdriver. 
 ROSE : I've had enough of this now! 
 The Doctor walks off. 
 ROSE : Who are you, then? Who's that lot down there? I said, who are they? 
 THE DOCTOR : They're made of plastic. Living plastic creatures. They're being controlled by a relay device in the roof. Which would be a great big problem if I didn't have this.  (Shows her an electronic device).  So!  (Opens fire exit for Rose).  I'm going to go up there and blow them up, and I might well die in the process. But don't worry about me, no. Go home, go on! Go and have your lovely beans on toast. 
 EXT. HENRICKS 
 Rose goes through the door. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Don't tell anyone about this, because if you do, you'll get them killed. 
 He shuts the door. Rose turns away looking slightly bemused. It opens again. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I'm the Doctor, by the way, what's your name? 
 ROSE : Rose. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life. 
 He shuts the door again. Rose runs. Outside, nobody knows what is going on. Rose is distracted and nearly gets herself run over by a taxi. 
 TAXI DRIVER : Watch it! 
 Rose proceeds to get as far away from the building as possible and looks back just in time to see the top floor blow up. She runs home - past a police box. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 News 24 is on the television. Rose is sat on the sofa, watching it. 
 REPORTER : The whole of Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire. Earlier reports in the... 
 The dummy's arm is lying on a chair. Jackie walks in holding a phone to her ear. 
 JACKIE TYLER : I know, it's on the telly! It's everywhere! She's lucky to be alive!  (Hands Rose a mug).  Honestly, it's aged her. Skin like an old bible. Walking in now you'd think I was HER daughter! Oh and here's himself... 
 Mickey appears in the doorway. 
 MICKEY SMITH   (to Rose) : I've been phoning your mobile, you could've been dead! It's on the news and everything! I can't believe that your shop went up! 
 He hugs her. 
 ROSE : I'm alright, honestly, I'm fine! Don't make a fuss. 
 MICKEY : Well, what happened? 
 ROSE : I don't know! 
 MICKEY : What was it though, what caused it? 
 ROSE : I wasn't in the shop, I was outside, I didn't see anything... 
 JACKIE   (walking in) : It's Debbie on the other end, she knows a man from the Mirror. Five hundred quid for an interview! 
 ROSE : Oh that's brilliant! Give it here! 
 She takes the phone and hangs it up. 
 JACKIE : Well, you've gotta find some way of making money. Your jobs kaput and I'm not bailing you out.  (Phone rings again, Jackie answers).  Beth! She's alive!  (Leaves room).  I tell ya, sue for compensation! She was within seconds of death... 
 MICKEY : What're you drinking? Tea?? No, no no, that's no good, that's no good. You're in shock, you need something stronger. 
 ROSE : Why? 
 MICKEY : You deserve a proper drink, you and me, we're going down the pub, my treat. How about it? 
 ROSE   (smiling) : Is there a match on? 
 MICKEY : I'm just thinking about you, babe! 
 ROSE : There's a match on, ain't there. 
 MICKEY : Well, that's not the point. We could catch the last five minutes. 
 ROSE : Go on then. I'm fine, really. Go. Get rid of that... 
 She gestures to the dummy's arm. Mickey points to his lips. Rose gives him a kiss. He pushes her back onto the chair and they laugh. He gets up to go and Rose puts a leg out to trip him up. Mickey picks up the arm and waves with it. 
 MICKEY : Buh Bye! 
 ROSE : Bye! 
 Mickey pretends to strangle himself with the arm and leaves. Rose shakes her head fondly and turns her attention back to the news. 
 REPORTER : ... fire then spread throughout the store... there is very little chance of saving the infrastructure... 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Outside, Mickey tosses the arm into a bin as he walks past it. Zoom into the darkness of the bin... 
 INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM 
 ...and out onto the red 7:30 on Rose's alarm clock. Rose whacks it to stop it beeping and sits up. 
 JACKIE   (in background) : There's no point in getting up, sweetheart. You've got no job to go to. 
 Rose flops back on her pillow. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 Rose is having breakfast, her mother is talking to her. 
 JACKIE : There's Finches... You could try them. They've always got jobs. 
 ROSE : Oh, great. The butchers. 
 JACKIE : Well it might do you good! That shop was giving you airs and graces. And I'm not joking about getting compensation. You've had genuine shock and trauma! Arianna got two thousand quid off the council just because the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek! I know she IS Greek, but that's not the point, it's a valid claim. 
 Rose hears a rattling and stands up. 
 ROSE : Mum, you're such a liar, I told you to nail that cat flap down. We're going to get strays! 
 JACKIE : I did it weeks back! 
 ROSE : No, you thought about it! 
 Rose discovers that the screws have fallen out onto the floor. The cat flap moves violently. Rose leaps backwards, then comes back again and pokes the cat flap open gingerly. The Doctor's face is right outside it. Rose gasps and opens the door. 
 THE DOCTOR : What're you doing here? 
 ROSE : I live here. 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, what do you do that for? 
 ROSE : Because I do! And I'm only at home because someone blew up my job. 
 The Doctor gets out his sonic screwdriver. 
 THE DOCTOR : Must've got the wrong signal. You're not plastic, are you?  (Knocks on Rose's forehead).  No, bonehead. Bye, then! 
 He makes to go, but Rose pulls him back inside. 
 ROSE : You, inside. Right now. 
 She shuts the door. 
 JACKIE : Who is it? 
 INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM 
 Rose pokes her head into Jackie's bedroom. 
 ROSE : It's about last night, he's part of the inquiry. Give us 10 minutes. 
 JACKIE : She deserves compensation. 
 THE DOCTOR : Huh, we're talking millions. 
 The Doctor leans against the doorframe, waiting for Rose to come back. Jackie looks at him for a moment and stands up, flirtatiously. 
 JACKIE : I'm in my dressing gown. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes, you are. 
 JACKIE : There's a strange man in my bedroom. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes, there is. 
 JACKIE : Well, anything could happen. 
 THE DOCTOR : No. 
 The Doctor walks off. Jackie pulls a face at his back. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 ROSE : Don't mind the mess. Do you want a coffee? 
 THE DOCTOR : Might as well, thanks! Just milk. 
 Rose goes into the kitchen and starts making coffee. 
 INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN 
 ROSE : We should go to the police. Seriously. Both of us. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 The Doctor picks up a gossip magazine. 
 THE DOCTOR : That won't last, he's gay and she's an alien. 
 INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN 
 ROSE : I'm not blaming you, even if it was just some sort of joke that went wrong. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 The Doctor picks up a book and flicks through it. 
 THE DOCTOR : Sad ending. 
 INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN 
 ROSE : They said on the news they'd found a body. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 The Doctor picks up an envelope and reads it. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose Tyler.  (Looks in mirror).  Ahh, could've been worse!  (Prods his large ears).  Look at me' ears. 
 INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN 
 ROSE : All the same, he was nice. Nice bloke. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 The Doctor shuffles a pack of cards. 
 THE DOCTOR : Luck be a lady! 
 INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN 
 ROSE : Well anyway if we are going to go to the police, I want to know what I'm saying. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 The Doctor shuffles the cards again and manages to make them all go flying. 
 INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I want you to explain everything. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 THE DOCTOR   (of the cards) : Maybe not.  (Hears scuffling from behind sofa).  What's that then? You got a cat? 
 INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN 
 ROSE : No... 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 The Doctor leans behind the sofa and the dummy's arm leaps out and grabs him by the neck. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (wandering in with coffee) : We did have, but there's these strays, they come in off the estate... 
 Behind her, the Doctor is being strangled viciously by the hand while he tries vainly to fight it off. She does not quite seem to register that the Doctor is being harassed by a rubber hand. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I told Mickey to chuck that out...  (She puts the coffee down on the table).  Honestly, give a man a plastic hand... anyway, I don't even know your name, Doctor... what was it? 
 The Doctor throws the hand off and it flies across the room attaching itself to Rose's face. She screams and the Doctor leaps up and tries to pull it off. 
 INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM 
 Jackie is drying her hair, completely oblivious. 
 INT. TYLER'S LIVING ROOM 
 The Doctor and Rose crash onto the coffee table, breaking it, and roll onto the floor. The Doctor pushes her back onto the sofa and gets out his sonic screwdriver, disabling the hand. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's alright, I've stopped it. There you go, you see?  (Tosses it to her).  'Armless. 
 ROSE : Do you think? 
 She uses it to whack him on the shoulder. 
 THE DOCTOR : Ow! 
 INT. STAIRWELL 
 The Doctor is running down the stairs, Rose hot on his tail. 
 ROSE : Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes I can. Here I am, this is me, swanning off. See ya! 
 ROSE : That arm was moving, it tried to kill me! 
 THE DOCTOR : Ten out of ten for observation. 
 ROSE : You can't just walk away, that's not fair! You've got to tell me what's going on. 
 THE DOCTOR : No I don't. 
 They reach the bottom of the stairs, go through the doors. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 ROSE : Alright then. I'll go to the police. I'll tell everyone. You said, if I did that, I'd get people killed. So, your choice. Tell me, or I'll start talking. 
 THE DOCTOR : Is that supposed to sound tough? 
 ROSE : Sort of. 
 THE DOCTOR : Doesn't work. 
 ROSE : Who are you? 
 THE DOCTOR : I told you! The Doctor. 
 ROSE : Yeah. But Doctor what? 
 THE DOCTOR : Just the Doctor. 
 ROSE : The Doctor. 
 THE DOCTOR : Hello! 
 ROSE : Is that supposed to sound impressive? 
 THE DOCTOR : Sort of. 
 ROSE : Come on. You can tell me. I've seen enough. Are you the police? 
 THE DOCTOR : No. I was just passing through. I'm a long way from home. 
 ROSE : But what have I done wrong? How comes those plastic things keep coming after me? 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh! Suddenly the entire world revolves around you! You were just an accident, you got in the way, that's all. 
 ROSE : It tried to kill me! 
 THE DOCTOR : It was after me, not you! Last night, in the shop, I was there, you blundered it. Almost ruined the whole thing. This morning, I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down... the only reason it fixed on you is that you met me. 
 ROSE : So, what you're saying is, the entire world revolves around you. 
 THE DOCTOR : Sort of, yeah. 
 ROSE : You're full of it! 
 THE DOCTOR : Sort of, yeah. 
 ROSE : But, all this plastic stuff, who else knows about it? 
 THE DOCTOR : No one. 
 ROSE : What, you're on your own? 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, who else is there? I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, go to bed, and watch telly! When all the time, underneath you, there's a war going on! 
 Rose takes the arm off him. 
 ROSE : Okay, start from the beginning. 
 EXT. ROAD 
 ROSE : If you're gonna go with this living plastic, and I don't even believe that, but if we do... how did you kill it? 
 THE DOCTOR : The thing controlling it projects life into the arm. I cut off the signal, dead. 
 ROSE : So that's radio control? 
 THE DOCTOR : Thought control.  (Silence)  Are you alright? 
 ROSE : Yeah. So, who's controlling it, then? 
 THE DOCTOR : Long story. 
 ROSE : But what's it all for? I mean, shop window dummies... what's that about? Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops? 
 They laugh. 
 THE DOCTOR : No. 
 ROSE : I know. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's not a price war.  (Laugh again. Suddenly serious).  They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you. Do you believe me? 
 ROSE : No. 
 THE DOCTOR : But you're still listening. 
 She stops. The Doctor walks on. 
 ROSE : Really though, Doctor. Tell me. Who are you? 
 THE DOCTOR   (stops) : Do you know like we were saying? About the Earth revolving?  (Walks back to her).  It's like when you were a kid. The first time they tell you the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it because everything looks like it's standing still. I can feel it.  (Takes her hand).  The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour, and the entire planet is hurtling around the sun at sixty-seven thousand miles an hour, and I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me. Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...  (Lets go of her hand).  That's who I am. Now, forget me, Rose Tyler.  (Takes the arm, waves it in her face).  Go home. 
 He walks away. Rose watches his retreating back and then starts to walk herself. The Doctor steps into a police box. Rose hears the sound of the TARDIS departing. She runs back as fast as she can. The police box is gone. She shields her eyes from the sun, looks around her, then walks away again. 
 INT. MICKEY'S FLAT 
 Mickey lets Rose in. 
 MICKEY : Yahey, there's my woman!  (Slaps her bum).  Kit off! 
 ROSE : Shut up.  (He gives her a kiss).  Mwah! 
 MICKEY : Coffee? 
 ROSE : Yeah, only if you wash the mug. And I don't mean rinse, I mean wash. Can I use your computer? 
 MICKEY : Yeah. Any excuse to get in the bedroom. 
 Mickey goes into the kitchen. Rose closes the door of his bedroom behind her. 
 MICKEY : Don't read my emails! 
 INT. MICKEY'S BEDROOM 
 Rose turns on the computer and types "Doctor" into a search engine. No relevant results are found. She types in "Doctor Living Plastic". Still nothing. She types "Doctor Blue Box". The first result reads "Doctor Who - do you know this man? Contact Clive here..." She clicks on it and a webpage with a blurry photograph of the Doctor and the words "Have you seen this man? Contact Clive" are presented to her. She clicks "Contact Clive". 
 EXT. CLIVE'S HOUSE 
 Mickey and Rose are sitting in the car. 
 ROSE : You're not coming in! He's safe, he's got a wife and kids. 
 MICKEY : Yeah but who told you that? He did. That's exactly what an Internet lunatic murderer would say. 
 Rose gets out of the car anyway, grinning. Mickey doesn't look too happy, and gives a man putting out his rubbish the evils. Rose knocks on the door of a house and it is answered by a boy of about 11. 
 ROSE : Uh, hello, I've come to see Clive? We've been emailing. 
 CLIVE'S SON : Dad! It's one of your nutters! 
 Clive appears. 
 CLIVE : Sorry. Hello. You must be Rose. I'm Clive. Obviously! 
 ROSE : I better tell you now, my boyfriend's waiting in the car, just in case you're going to kill me! 
 They laugh. 
 CLIVE : No, good point. No murders. 
 He waves to Mickey who nods, still distrustful. 
 CAROLINE : Who is it? 
 CLIVE : Oh it's something to do with the Doctor! She's been reading the website. Please come through, I'm in the shed. 
 Clive's wife, Caroline, comes down the stairs carrying a washing basket. 
 CAROLINE : She? She read a website about the Doctor? She's a she? 
 She smiles ironically and shuts the door. Mickey looks suspicious. 
 INT. CLIVE'S SHED 
 Clive is showing Rose around the shed, which is a sort of shrine to the Doctor. 
 CLIVE : A lot of this stuff's quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it to you. People might intercept it, if you know what I mean. If you dig deep enough - keep a lively mind - this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place. Political diaries, conspiracy theories. Even ghost stories. No first name, no last name. Just "The Doctor". Always The Doctor. And the title seems to have been passed down from father to son, it appears to be an inheritance. That's your Doctor there, isn't it? 
 He points to a photo of the Doctor on a computer screen behind them. 
 ROSE : Yeah. 
 CLIVE : I tracked it down to the Washington public archive last year. The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original... 
 He shows Rose some photographs of the Doctor standing in a crowd at the time and place of the assassination of JFK. 
 CLIVE : November the 22nd, 1963. The assassination of President Kennedy. 
 ROSE : Must be his father... 
 CLIVE : Going further back... April 1912.  (Brings over a photo album) .  This is a photo of the Daniels family, Southampton. And friend.  (Points to the Doctor, standing with them).  This was taken the day before they were due to sail off for the New World. On the Titanic. And for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip and survived. And...  (Shows her a sketch).  1883. Another Doctor. And look - the same lineage. He's identical. This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra on the very day Krakatoa exploded. The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history. When disaster comes, he's there. He has a storm in his wake. And he has one constant companion. 
 ROSE : Who's that? 
 CLIVE : Death. 
 EXT. CLIVE'S HOUSE 
 Mickey is still waiting outside in his car. He looks around as a bin starts to shuffle its way towards him. 
 INT. CLIVE'S SHED 
 CLIVE (CONT'D) : If the Doctor's back... if you've seen him, Rose... then one thing's for certain, we're all in danger. 
 EXT. CLIVE'S HOUSE 
 Mickey looks at the bin again, but it is stationary. A few seconds later, it starts moving again. He gets out of the car and walks to the bin, looking around it to see what is moving it. Seeing nothing, he places both hands on the lid and opens it dramatically. 
 MICKEY : Come on then! 
 The bin is empty. 
 INT. CLIVE'S SHED 
 CLIVE : If he's singled you out... If the Doctor's making house calls... then God help you. 
 EXT. CLIVE'S HOUSE 
 Mickey shuts the bin, confused. He tries to walk away but his hands are stuck to the bin. When he tries to pull away, the bin stretches and won't let him. Eventually, the bin opens its lid and pulls him in backwards, shutting with a satisfied burp. 
 INT. CLIVE'S SHED 
 ROSE : Who is he? Who do you think he is? 
 CLIVE : I think he's the same man. I think he's immortal. I think he's an alien from another world. 
 EXT. CLIVE'S HOUSE 
 Rose comes back to the car, talking before she's even got in. 
 ROSE : Alright! He's a nutter! Off his head! COMPLETE online conspiracy freak. You win! Oof. 
 She gets into the car. The person sitting at the wheel is obviously not Mickey, but a plastic replica of him. Rose seems not to notice. 
 ROSE : What're we going to do tonight? I fancy a pizza. 
 MICKEY : Pizzaaa! P-p-p-pizza! 
 ROSE : ...or a Chinese... 
 MICKEY : Pizza! 
 They drive off in a wobbly line. 
 
 
 
 INT. RESTAURANT 
 Rose and Mickey sit at a table for two in a restaurant. 
 ROSE : Do you think I should try the hospital? Suki said they had a few jobs going in the canteen. That's it then... dishing out chips... I could do A Levels... 
 "Mickey" stares at her, grinning. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I dunno. It's all Jimmy Stone's fault. I only left school because of him, and look where he ended up. What do you think? 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : So, where did you meet this Doctor? 
 ROSE : I'm sorry, wasn't I talking about me for a second? 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : Because, I reckon it started back at the shop, am I right? Is he something to do with that? 
 ROSE : No... 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : Come on. 
 ROSE : Sort of. 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : What was he doing there? 
 ROSE : I'm not going on about him, Mickey, I'm not, because, I know it sounds daft but... I don't think he's safe. I think he's dangerous. 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : But you can trust me sweetheart!  (In quick succession).  Babe, sugar, darling, sugar. 
 Rose looks confused. 
 PLASTIC MICKEY (CONT'D) : You can tell me anything. Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning, and I can help you, Rose. Because that's all I really wanna do, sweetheart, babe, sugar, sweetheart. 
 ROSE : What're you doing that for? 
 A Waiter approaches the table. 
 WAITER : Your champagne. 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : We didn't order any champagne.  (Grabs Rose's hand).  Where's the Doctor? 
 The Waiter has simply moved to the other side of the table and holds the bottle out to Rose. 
 WAITER : Ma'am. Your champagne. 
 ROSE : It's not ours... Mickey, what is it? What's wrong? 
 MICKEY : I need to find out how much you know, so where is he? 
 WAITER : Doesn't anybody want this champagne? 
 Plastic Mickey, exasperated, raises his eyes to the waiter for the first time. 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : Look, we didn't order i...  (The Waiter is in fact the Doctor).  Ah. Gotcha. 
 The Doctor shakes the bottle. 
 THE DOCTOR : Don't mind me. I'm just toasting the happy couple. On the house! 
 The cork pops out and hits Mickey squarely on the forehead. His forehead absorbs the cork and he spits it out of his mouth. It is finally revealed to Rose that Mickey has in fact been replaced with an Auton. 
 PLASTIC MICKEY : Anyway.  (His hands turn into clubs and he smashes the table in. Rose screams and runs out of the way. The Doctor grabs the Auton's head and pulls it off).  Don't think that's gonna stop me. 
 A couple at a nearby table scream, but the Doctor grins. Rose presses the fire bell. 
 ROSE : Everyone out! Out now! 
 Everyone runs for the exit. The Auton stays inside, blindly smashing tables with his club-hands. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Get out! Get out! Get out! 
 Rose and the Doctor run through the kitchen and out of a back exit. 
 EXT. BACK YARD 
 With the Auton in hot pursuit. The Doctor locks a metal door with his sonic screwdriver while Rose tries desperately to find an escape out of the yard they are in. She bangs desperately at some locked gates. 
 ROSE : Open the gate! Use that tube thing, come on! 
 THE DOCTOR : What, this? This is a sonic screwdriver. 
 ROSE : Use it! 
 THE DOCTOR : Nah. Tell ya what, let's go in here. 
 He approaches a police box in the middle of the yard and unlocks it. The Auton is beginning to make dents in the door from the other side. Rose runs to look at it. 
 ROSE : We can't hide inside a wooden box!  (Runs to the gate and rattles the chains).  It's gonna get us! Doctor! 
 She runs into the police box. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose slams the door behind her, takes a few steps in, looks around, then runs straight back out again. 
 EXT. BACK YARD 
 She walks once around the police box and arrives back at the front again. The Auton finally makes a hole in the door, so she runs back into the police box. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 ROSE : It's gonna follow us! 
 THE DOCTOR : The assembled hoards of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door, and believe me, they've tried. Now, shut up a minute. 
 Rose stands trembling near the door of the TARDIS, looking around at how huge it is compared with the outside. The Doctor is wiring up the head of the Auton. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You see, the arm is too simple, but the head's perfect. 
 Rose still looks overwhelmed. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source. Right.  (Turns to Rose, gives her his full attention).  Where do you want to start? 
 ROSE : Um... the inside's bigger than the outside? 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes. 
 ROSE : It's alien. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yup. 
 ROSE : Are you alien? 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes.  (Rose stares).  Is that alright? 
 ROSE   (quickly) : Yeah. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's called the TARDIS, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.  (A small sob from Rose).  That's okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us. 
 ROSE : Did they kill him? Mickey? Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead? 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh... didn't think of that. 
 ROSE : He's my boyfriend. You pulled off his head.They copied him and you didn't even think? And now you're just going to let him melt?! 
 THE DOCTOR : Melt?  (Turns around in time to see "Mickey's head melting with a bubbling noise) . Oh, no, no, no, no, no, NO! 
 He starts running frantically around the console, pressing buttons and pulling levers. 
 ROSE : What're you doing?! 
 THE DOCTOR : Reviving the signal, it's fading! Wait I've got it...  (Looks at screen).  No, No, No, No, No, No, NO!  (The TARDIS shakes as the engines move).  Almost there! Almost there! Here we go! 
 The engines stop and the Doctor runs out the the TARDIS doors without another word. 
 ROSE : You can't go out there, it's not safe! 
 She follows him outside. 
 EXT. THAMES EMBANKMENT, OPPOSITE LONDON EYE 
 THE DOCTOR : I lost the signal, I got so close. 
 Rose hops out of the TARDIS, looking confused again. 
 ROSE : We've moved! Does it fly? 
 THE DOCTOR : Disappears there, reappears here, you wouldn't understand. 
 ROSE : But if we're somewhere else, what about that headless thing? It's still on the loose. 
 THE DOCTOR : It melted with the head, are you going to witter on all night? 
 ROSE : I'll have to tell his mother... 
 The Doctor looks at her questioningly. 
 ROSE : Mickey! I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him, again! 
 The Doctor rolls his eyes, unconcerned. 
 ROSE : You were right, you ARE alien. 
 She turns to walk away. 
 THE DOCTOR : Look, if I did forget some kid called Mickey... 
 ROSE : Yeah, he's not a kid. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's because I'm trying to save the life of every stupid ape blundering on top of this planet, alright? 
 ROSE : Alright! 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes! It is! 
 Rose shakes her head disbelievingly. 
 ROSE : If you are an alien, then how comes you sound like you're from the North? 
 THE DOCTOR : Lots of planets have a North. 
 He folds his arms indignantly and looks away. 
 ROSE : What's a police public call box? 
 THE DOCTOR : It's a telephone box from the 1950s.  (Pats the TARDIS fondly, grinning).  It's a disguise. 
 Rose smiles and shakes her head. 
 ROSE : Okay. And this living plastic, what's it got against us? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nothing, it loves you. You've got such a good planet. Lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins in the air... perfect. Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs. It's food stock was destroyed in the war, all its protein plants rotted, so Earth... dinner! 
 ROSE : Any way of stopping it? 
 Grinning, the Doctor produces a tube of blue liquid from his jacket. 
 THE DOCTOR : Anti-plastic! 
 ROSE : Anti-plastic... 
 THE DOCTOR : Anti-plastic! But first I've got to find it. How can you hide something that big in a city this small? 
 ROSE : Hold on... hide what? 
 THE DOCTOR : The transmitter. The Consciousness is controlling every single piece of plastic so it needs a transmitter to boost the signal. 
 ROSE : What's it look like? 
 THE DOCTOR : Like a transmitter. Round and massive, slap bang in the middle of London. 
 He paces around, agitated, looking around for a clue. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : A huge circular metal structure... like a dish... 
 He stands facing Rose, his back to the railings of the bridge. Behind him, the London Eye looms 450 foot above them, but he doesn't seem to register. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : ...like a wheel. Close to where we're standing. Must be completely invisible. 
 Rose considers the Eye behind him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : What? 
 Rose nods towards the Eye. The Doctor turns around, then back to her, completely nonplussed. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : What? 
 Rose shakes her head, looking at the Eye still. He turns around but still fails to make the connection. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : What is it? What? 
 Rose simply carries on staring at it. The Doctor turns around again and finally, it clicks. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Oh... fantastic! 
 He grins inanely and runs off. 
 EXT. LONDON BRIDGE 
 Hand in hand, the Doctor and Rose run across London Bridge towards the Eye. 
 EXT. LONDON EYE 
 They come to a halt at the foot of the Eye. 
 THE DOCTOR : Think of it. Plastic, all over the world. Every artificial thing waiting to come alive. The shop window dummies, the phones, the wires, the cables... 
 ROSE : The breast implants... 
 THE DOCTOR : Still, we've found the transmitter. The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath. 
 Rose runs off and finds the entrance to a manhole at the foot of the wall she is looking over. 
 ROSE : What about down here? 
 The Doctor runs to join her. 
 THE DOCTOR : Looks good to me. 
 They run down the stairs to the manhole. The Doctor takes the lid off it, and red light and smoke pours out. They both climb down the ladder underground. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 The Doctor opens the door to another chamber and they go down some steps. The Doctor points to a huge, orange, wobbling mass in the middle of the chamber. 
 THE DOCTOR : The Nestene Consciousness, that's it, inside the vat. A living, plastic creature. 
 ROSE : Well, then. Tip in your anti-plastic and let's go. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm not here to kill it. I've got to give it a chance. 
 They go down some more steps. The Doctor leans over the railings and addresses the Consciouness. 
 THE DOCTOR : I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract. According to convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation. 
 The Consciouness flobbles around a bit. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Thank you. That I might have permission to approach. 
 Meanwhile, as Rose paces around in the background, she spots Mickey and runs to him. The Doctor rolls his eyes. 
 ROSE : Oh, my God! Mickey! It's okay! It's alright! 
 She squats down next to him. 
 MICKEY : That thing down there, the liquid, Rose, it can talk! 
 ROSE : You're stinking! Doctor, they kept him alive! 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah, that was always a possibility. Keep him alive to maintain the copy. 
 ROSE : You knew that and you never said? 
 THE DOCTOR : Can we keep the domestics outside, thank you? 
 Rose helps Mickey to his feet. The Doctor approaches the Consciousness. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Am I addressing the Consciousness? Thank you. If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilization by means of warped, shunt technology. So, may I suggest, with the greatest respect, that you shunt off? 
 The plastic globbers in what appears to be a negative manner. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Oh don't give me that, it's an invasion! Plain and simple! Don't talk about constitutional rights! 
 The plastic rears what would appear to be its head angrily. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I... am... talking! This planet is just starting. These stupid little people have only just learnt how to walk, but they're capable of so much more. I'm asking you on their behalf - please, just go. 
 Two Autons approach the Doctor from behind. 
 ROSE : Doctor! 
 The Autons grab him. One of them takes the anti-plastic out of his jacket pocket. 
 THE DOCTOR : That was just insurance! I wasn't going to USE it. 
 The plastic globbers angrily. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I was not attacking you. I'm here to help. I'm not your enemy. I swear, I'm not... what do you mean? 
 Doors above him open to reveal the TARDIS. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Oh, oh no, honestly, no! Yes, that's my ship. 
 The plastic roars. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : That's not true. I should know, I was there. I fought in the war. It wasn't my fault! I couldn't save your world! I couldn't save any of them! 
 ROSE : What's it doing?! 
 THE DOCTOR : It's the TARDIS! The Nestene has identified its superior technology. It's terrified! It's going to the final base. It's starting the invasion! Get out, Rose! Just leg it! Now! 
 Rose dials a number on her mobile. 
 ROSE : Mum?! 
 EXT. TOWN CENTRE 
 Jackie is going down the steps of a police station. 
 JACKIE : Oh, there you are, I was just gonna phone. You can get compensation. I said so. I've got this document thing off the police - don't thank me! 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 ROSE : Where are you, mum? 
 EXT. TOWN CENTRE 
 JACKIE : I'm in town! 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 ROSE : Go home! Just go home, right now! 
 EXT. TOWN CENTRE 
 JACKIE : Darling, you're breaking up, look, I'm just going to do a bit of late night shopping. I'll see you later. Tara! 
 She hangs up. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 ROSE : Mum?! Mum! 
 EXT. TOWN CENTRE 
 Jackie heads into the Queens Arcade shopping centre. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 The Consciousness sends out a signal. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's the activation signal! It's transmitting! 
 EXT. LONDON EYE 
 The electric blue signal shoots around the Eye. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 ROSE : The end of the world... 
 EXT. LONDON EYE 
 The activation signal transmits from the London Eye. 
 INT. QUEEN'S ARCADE 
 Clive is in the shopping centre, talking to his wife. 
 CLIVE : There's no point creating a spreadsheet if you're going to spend summer money in winter months. 
 Caroline gasps as she walks past a shop window and the dummy taps the glass. 
 CAROLINE : Oh my God! I thought they were dummies! I nearly had a heart-attack! 
 They look around and all the dummies are doing the same. Clive's wife smiles appreciatively... until they punch their way through the glass and step out of the windows. Jackie is coming down an escalator and looks in disbelief at the dummies walking around. 
 CLIVE : It's true. Everything I read, all the stories! It's all true! 
 A dummy turns towards him. Its hand comes off and reveals a gun, which shoots him. Clive's wife and son scream. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 The Doctor is still being held hostage. 
 THE DOCTOR : Get out, Rose! Just get out! Run! 
 Part of the ceiling falls in. 
 ROSE : The stairs have gone! 
 Rose and Mickey try desperately to get into the TARDIS. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I haven't got the key! 
 MICKEY : We're gonna die! 
 INT. QUEEN'S ARCADE 
 The shopping centre is in chaos. Jackie stands at the bottom of the escalator looking confused for a few seconds, then screams and runs, dropping her shopping bag. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 Mickey and Rose are still cowering at the door of the TARDIS. 
 EXT. STREET 
 Outside, Jackie finds that there is just as much chaos outside the shopping centre as there is inside. An army of dummies come out of the doors. Jackie runs down the road and ducks behind a car outside a wedding shop. The dummies in the window punch through the glass. Jackie screams. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 Rose watches the Doctor struggle to get to the anti-plastic, then seems to reach some kind of decision. She stands up. 
 MICKEY : Just leave him! 
 EXT. STREET 
 The wedding dummies advance dangerously on Jackie. All three hold their arms out ready to shoot. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 Rose takes action. 
 MICKEY (CONT'D) : There's nothing you can do! 
 Rose picks up an axe. 
 ROSE : I've got no A Levels. 
 EXT. STREET 
 The dummies raise their guns. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : No job... 
 EXT. STREET 
 The hands open to reveal the space where the bullets can be released. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : No future. 
 EXT. STREET 
 Jackie cowers. Rose hacks at a chain on the wall, trying to release it. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : But I tell you what I have got. Jericho Street Junior School under 7s gymnastic team. 
 The chain comes loose and Rose grabs onto it. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I got the bronze! 
 Rose swings across the gap over the Consciousness. She kicks the Autons holding the Doctor hostage into the Nestene, anti-plastic and all. The Consciousness starts to writhe and scream. Rose lands safely in the Doctor's arms at the other side of the gap. 
 THE DOCTOR : Now we're in trouble. 
 The Consciousness starts to explode as Rose and the Doctor run off. The signal from the Eye is cut off. 
 EXT. STREET 
 The Autons in the high street that were previously attacking people, stop, and start to twitch as if they are doing some kind of dance. Jackie uncovers her eyes warily. 
 INT. UNDERNEATH LONDON EYE 
 Rose, the Doctor and Mickey all manage to reach the TARDIS. Rose grins at the Consciousness before she goes in and closes the door, as it starts to die. Just before the whole chamber goes up in flames, the TARDIS disappears. 
 EXT. STREET 
 The dummies all fall to the ground, twitching at first, but dead. 
 EXT. ALLEYWAY 
 Mickey runs backwards out of the TARDIS and falls over, looking terrified. He backs against a wall. Rose, however, steps out and rings her mother on her mobile. 
 EXT. STREET 
 JACKIE   (answers phone) : Rose! Rose! Don't go out of the house, it's not safe! 
 EXT. ALLEYWAY 
 Rose laughs in relief to hear Jackie's voice. 
 EXT. STREET 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : There were all of these things! And they were shooting! And they... 
 EXT. ALLEYWAY 
 Satisfied that Jackie is alive, Rose hangs up on her, smiling to herself. 
 EXT. STREET 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : Hello? Hello? 
 EXT. ALLEYWAY 
 Rose runs over to Mickey. 
 ROSE : A fat lot of good you were! 
 Mickey whimpers. The Doctor stands in the doorway of the TARDIS. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nestene Consciousness?  (Clicks fingers).  Easy. 
 ROSE   (teasingly) : You were useless in there. You'd be dead if it wasn't for me. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes, I would. Thank you. Right then! I'll be off! Unless, uh... I don't know... you could come with me. 
 Rose looks at him and puts her hands in her pockets. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : This box isn't just a London hopper, you know, it goes anywhere in the universe free of charge. 
 MICKEY : Don't! He's an alien! He's a thing! 
 THE DOCTOR : He's NOT invited. What do you think? You could stay here and fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go, uh... anywhere. 
 ROSE : Is it always this dangerous? 
 THE DOCTOR   (nods) : Yeah. 
 Mickey puts his arms around Rose's legs like a little child. 
 ROSE : Yeah, I can't... I've um... gotta go and find my mum and um... someone's gotta look after this stupid lump...  (Small laugh, pats Mickey on the back) . So... 
 THE DOCTOR : Okay. See you around. 
 Rose looks at him intensely, as if she still hasn't really made up her mind. The Doctor does not take his eyes off her, but closes the door. Rose looks at the closed door. The engines of the TARDIS rev up, and it slowly disappears. Rose stares at the space where it was, lost in thought. 
 ROSE : Come on, let's go. 
 Mickey is in absolute shock, staring at the empty space where the TARDIS stood. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : C'mon... come on... 
 She helps him to his feet and they begin to walk away. However, the sound of the engines is heard again. Rose and Mickey spin around. The TARDIS reappears. The Doctor pops his head out. 
 THE DOCTOR : By the way... Did I mention, it also travels in time? 
 He grins and goes back in, leaving the door ajar. Rose turns to Mickey. 
 ROSE : Thanks. 
 MICKEY : Thanks for what? 
 ROSE : Exactly. 
 She kisses his cheek and runs into the TARDIS with a broad smile on her face.
