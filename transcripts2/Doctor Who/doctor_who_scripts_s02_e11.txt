 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 The camera pans down from blue skies with puffy white clouds to a banner bearing the legend "LONDON 2012", with the World Olympics logo. We're looking upon an ordinary suburban street, with well kept houses. A council worker applies a blow torch to the road, evidently carrying out maintenance work. A woman wheels her baby along in her pushchair. 
 POSTMAN : Morning, love. 
 WOMAN : Morning! 
 She goes on her way, passing a house with two boys Tom and his friend Dale Hixon, playing football on the front lawn and a man, Tom's Dad, cleaning a car. 
 TOM   (upon scoring a goal):  Yes! 
 WOMAN : Hiya! 
 TOM'S DAD : All right? 
 A poster on a lamppost asks for information about a missing girl, Jane McKillen. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 A girl of 12, Chloe, watches the proceedings from her bedroom window, her hand pressed against the glass. An old lady Maeve, pulls her trolley bag along behind her. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Switch to the old lady's point of view, a look of confusion passes over her face as a buzzing fills the air. She looks around. A woman, Trish, Chloe's mother, comes out of the house and watches her. 
 TRISH : Maeve? Are you okay? 
 MAEVE : No, love, I'm not. 
 TRISH : Do you want me to call a doctor? 
 MAEVE : A doctor can't help. 
 She looks around the superficially ordinary street nervously. 
 MAEVE (CONT'D) : Can't... can't you feel it, Trish? 
 TRISH : I can't feel anything. 
 Chloe still watches. Switch to her point of view. 
 MAEVE   (seeing the boys playing football):  Boys! Get indoors!  (Hurries over to them).  Get inside! Get them inside! 
 TOM'S DAD : What's up with you? They ain't done nothing wrong... 
 MAEVE : It's happening again! 
 Trish glances uneasily up at her daughter's silhouette at the window. She goes back inside. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 closing the door behind her and leaning against it. Chloe is singing and her voice carries down the stairs. 
 CHLOE   (singing softly):  Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree... 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Switch to Chloe's bedroom. 
 CHLOE (CONT'D)  (singing):  Merry merry king of the bush is he... laugh, Kookaburra laugh, Kookaburra gay your life must be. 
 She watches the boys playing football across the road. She turns back to her desk and pulls some paper and pencils towards her, and starts to draw. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Maeve is still trying to convince Tom's Dad to take the boys inside. 
 MAEVE : They're not safe! 
 TOM'S DAD : They're in the garden! 
 MAEVE : That's what it likes. It likes it when they're playing. Get them in, I'm begging you. 
 The boys glance at one another, sniggering. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe is singing whilst she draws. 
 [b]CHLOE [/b]  (singing):  Merry merry king of the bush is he... laugh, Kookaburra laugh, Kookaburra gay your life must be. 
 She is drawing one of the boys, Dale, outside. She has sketched the outline and is now colouring him in with unnatural speed. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 TOM'S DAD   (moving Maeve along):  I've got my beady eyes on them. 
 MAEVE : But, I... 
 He has her by the arm and his ushering her on her way. 
 TOM'S DAD : Come on. 
 The moment their backs are turned, there is whooshing sound as the blonde boy kicks the ball into the goal - Maeve and the Tom's Dad both turn, and the other little boy, Dale, has disappeared completely. 
 MAEVE   (turning):  No! 
 TOM'S DAD : T... Tom? 
 He dashes over to the football goal, looking around in confusion. 
 MAEVE   (shouts):  What are you? 
 TOM'S DAD   (baffled):  Where's he gone? 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 Trish can hear the commotion from just inside the front door. She glances up the stairs, arms folded, it's as though she knows what's wrong. 
 MAEVE   (from outside):  What do you want with our children?! 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe hums to herself as she finishes her drawing. As soon as she has finished the last stroke, the drawing comes to life. Dale's mouth opens in a silent scream, he's terrified, trapped inside the drawing. 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 EXT. CAR PARK 
 The TARDIS materialises right in-between two gates, one saying "DANGER - KEEP OUT" and the other saying "NO PARKING IN FRONT OF THESE GATES". The Doctor opens the door but the TARDIS has materialised the wrong was round. The gate is blocking the door completely. 
 THE DOCTOR : Ah. 
 He goes back inside. The TARDIS dematerialises, and materialises again, this time the right way round. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (stepping out):  Ah! 
 Rose follows him. They look around. Rose notices a Shayne Ward poster advertising his greatest hits album tacked onto a fence. 
 ROSE : So, near future, yeah? 
 THE DOCTOR : I had a passing fancy. Only it didn't pass, it stopped. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Rose and the Doctor walk down the road with the "LONDON 2012" banner. 
 THE DOCTOR : 30th Olympia. 
 ROSE   (delighted, linking her arm through his):  No way! Why didn't I think of this, that's great! Ah! 
 The Doctor beams. 
 THE DOCTOR : Only seems like yesterday a few naked Greek blokes were tossing a discus about... wrestling each other in the sand with crowds stood about, begging... no, wait a minute... that was Club Med.  (Laughs at his own joke, nudging Rose).  Just in time for the opening doo dah, ceremony... tonight, I thought you'd like that. Last one they had in London was dynamite. Wembley, 1948. I loved it so much, I went back and watched it all over again. Fella carrying the torch... lovely chap, what was his...? 
 Rose has noticed the "MISSING" posters tacked onto the lamp post, and moves closer to investigate, but the Doctor carries on oblivious, still yapping to himself. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Mark...? John..? Mark...? Legs like pipe cleaners, but strong as a whippet. 
 ROSE : Doctor... 
 THE DOCTOR : And in those days, everybody had a tea party to go to. 
 ROSE : Doctor? 
 THE DOCTOR : Did you ever have one of those little cakes with the crunchy ball bearings on top... 
 ROSE : You should really look. 
 THE DOCTOR : Do you know those, those things?  (Finally saunters over to her).  Nobody else in this entire galaxy's ever even bothered to make edible ball bearings. Genius.  (Reads the posters).  What's taking them, do you think?  (Scans the street).  Snatching children from a thoroughly ordinary street like this. Why's it so cold...? Is something reducing the temperature...? 
 ROSE : It says they all went missing this week. Why would a person do something like this? 
 THE DOCTOR   (considering her):  What makes you think it's a person? 
 Rose turns at the sound of a door opening, a woman dumps a recycling sack on the pavement outside her house and hurries back inside, casting furtive looks around her all the while. 
 ROSE : Whatever it is, it's got the whole street scared to death. Doctor, what...? 
 She turns, but the Doctor is already at the other end of the road. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE, TOM'S FRONT GARDEN 
 The Doctor quickly finds the place where Tom disappeared by the mini football goal. He holds his hand out in front of him, as though feeling something invisible. He crouches, his hand hovering above what appears to be an ordinary area of grass. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 As Rose hurries along the road, a car judders to a halt as the engine gives up the ghost. She stops to watch. A council worker, Kel, props his broom up against his white van and approaches the car. 
 KEL : There you go. Fifth today. Not natural, is it? 
 DRIVER : I dunno what happened, I had it serviced less than a month ago. 
 KEL : Nah, don't even try and explain it, mate. All the cars are doing it. And do you know what? It's bonkers. Bonkers. 
 The driver gets out of the car. 
 KEL (CONT'D) : Come on then, pal. I'll help you shift it. Quicker you're on the way, happier you'll be. 
 He pushes the car from behind, straining, whilst the driver pushes from the driver's side. 
 DRIVER : There we go. 
 ROSE : Do you want a hand? 
 KEL : No, we're all right, love. 
 ROSE  (grinning): No you're not. I'm tougher than I look, honest. 
 He positions herself behind the car and gestures for him to move over. He does and she helps him push it. The engine suddenly springs to life, causing Kel to promptly fall over. He stands, brushing himself down. 
 ROSE : Does this happen a lot? 
 DRIVER   (driving off):  Cheers, mate! 
 KEL   (disgruntled):  Been doing it all week. 
 ROSE : Since those children started going missing? 
 KEL   (not seeing the connection):  Yeah, I s'pose so. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE, TOM'S FRONT GARDEN 
 The Doctor giggles as he feels whatever sensation he's experiencing over the grass. 
 THE DOCTOR : Tickles! 
 Tom's Dad appears behind him, hands in his pockets. 
 TOM'S DAD : What's your game? 
 The Doctor spins around. 
 THE DOCTOR   (floundering):  My... um... Snakes and Ladders? Quite good at... Squash. Reasonable.  (Notices the look on Tom's Dad's face).  I'm... being facetious, aren't I? There's no call for it. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Rose and Kel walk along together. 
 KEL : Every car cuts out. The council are going nuts. I mean, they've given this street the works. Renamed it... I've been tarmacking every pot hole...  (He gestures proudly).  Look at that. Beauty, init? Yep! And all that is because that Olympic Torch comes right by the end of this close. Just down there. Everything's got to be perfect, ain't it? Only it ain't. 
 They come across Maeve. 
 MAEVE : It takes 'em when they're playing. 
 ROSE : What takes them? 
 Trish pops her head round her front door. 
 MAEVE : Danny... Jane... Dale... snatched in the blink of an eye. 
 The Doctor's voice, pleading, comes closer. He is backing away from Tom's Dad who looks like he's about to beat him up. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm... I'm a police officer! I've got a badge, and... and a police car... you don't have to get... I can... I can prove it! Just hold on. 
 He fishes in his pocket for the psychic paper. 
 TOM'S DAD   (roughly):  We've had plenty of coppers poking around here, and you don't look, or sound, like any of them. 
 THE DOCTOR   (pointing in Rose's face):  See, look! I've got a colleague! Lewis. 
 Rose gives Tom's Dad a policeman-like wink. 
 TOM'S DAD : Well, she looks less like a copper than you do. 
 THE DOCTOR : Training. New recruit. It was either that or hairdressing, so...  (Brandishes the psychic paper at Tom's Dad).  Voila! 
 TRISH   (who has joined them):  What are you going to do? 
 MAEVE : The police have knocked on every door, no clues, no leads, nothing. 
 TOM'S DAD : Look, kids run off sometimes, all right? That's what they do... 
 MAEVE : Dale Hixon in your garden, playing with your Tommy, and then...!  (She mimics something disappearing).  Right in front of me, like he was never there! There's no need to look any further than this street. It's right here amongst us. 
 THE DOCTOR : Why don't we... 
 NEIGHBOUR : Why don't we start with him?  (She points at Kel).  There's been all sorts like him in this street, day and night. 
 KEL  (indignantly): Fixing things up for the Olympics! 
 TOM'S DAD : Yeah, and taking an awful long time about it. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm of the opinion that all we've gotta do is just... 
 KEL   (not listening):  You don't... what you just said, that's slander! 
 NEIGHBOUR : I don't care what it is! 
 THE DOCTOR : I think we need to just... 
 KEL : I want an apology off her! 
 MAEVE : Stop picking on him. 
 KEL : Yeah, stop picking on me! 
 MAEVE : And stop pretending to be blind! It's evil! 
 NEIGHBOUR   (glaring at Kel):  I don't believe in evil. 
 KEL   (angrily):  Oh no, you just believe in tarmackers with sack loads of kidnapped kiddies in their van... 
 NEIGHBOUR : Ay, ay, ay, that's not what she's saying. 
 KEL : Would you stop ganging up on me?! 
 NEIGHBOUR  (shrilly): Feeling guilty, are we? 
 THE DOCTOR   (shouting over the babble):  Fingers on lips! 
 He puts his finger on his lips and glares around at them all as if daring them not to do the same. The council worker behind Kel has already obeyed, and after a moment of complete bewilderment, Kel and Tom's Dad put their fingers on their lips too. The Doctor looks pointedly at Rose, who follows suit. Now all of them have their fingers on their lips, and silence has fallen. 
 THE DOCTOR : In the last six days, three of your children have been stolen. Snatched out of thin air, right? 
 MAEVE  (gesturing to ask permission to take her finger off her lips): Er... can I...? 
 The Doctor motions for her to go ahead. 
 MAEVE (CONT'D) : Look around you... this was a safe street 'til it came. It's not a person. I'll say it if no one else will.  (Chloe watches from her window).  Maybe you're coppers, maybe you're not. I don't care who you are. Can you please help us? 
 Rose has spotted Chloe. Trish notices Rose watching her and spins around to look up at the window. She hurries back inside. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSETOM'S FRONT GARDEN 
 The camera pans down from the Union Flag Tom's Dad has hanging out of the upstairs window, to Tom's Dad himself, who parts his net curtains to see Rose standing outside his house and the Doctor sniffing around the front lawn like a sniffer-dog. Rose watches him for a few moments, before... 
 ROSE : Want a hanky? 
 THE DOCTOR : Can you smell it? 
 Rose sniffs. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : What does it remind you of? 
 ROSE : Sort of... metal? 
 THE DOCTOR   (nodding):  Mm-hm! 
 ROSE   (grinning):  Oooh! 
 The Doctor waves to Tom's Dad before they both leave. 
 EXT. ALLEYWAY 
 The Doctor and Rose walk down a narrow alleyway. 
 THE DOCTOR : Danny Edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other.  (He feels something again).  Whoa, there it goes again!  (Shows Rose the back of his hand).  Look at the hairs on the back of my manly hairy hand. 
 ROSE   (inhaling):  And there's that smell... it's like a um... a burnt fuse plug or something. 
 THE DOCTOR : There's a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished. Whatever it was, it used an awful lot of power to do this. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe watches a ginger cat on the front lawn through her window. It meows. Chloe pulls more paper towards her and begins to draw just as Trish enters. 
 TRISH : You have to come down some time, Chloe. 
 CHLOE   (drawing the cat, unnaturally fast):  I'm busy, mum. 
 TRISH   (looking at the pictures covering the walls):  Look at it in here... you must've used up half a rainforest. 
 Trish picks up the half finished drawing, Dale has been sketched on the same piece of paper. 
 TRISH (CONT'D) : That's Dale. Why did you draw him so sad? 
 CHLOE : I didn't draw him like that.  (Holds out her hand for the picture).  Dale made himself sad. So I'm gonna draw him a friend.  (Continues drawing the cat).  That's what he needs. More friends. 
 Trish watches her, brow furrowed. 
 TRISH   (trying to change the subject):  Have you seen the TV? 
 She taps a button on the laptop, bring up BBC News 24. Footage of Olympics is displayed. 
 TRISH : Look, this'll cheer you up. The Torch is gonna be close.  (Sits on the bed).  They'll pass right by our street. And tonight they'll light the Olympic Flame in the stadium, and the whole world will be looking at our city.  (Chloe doesn't even look up).  I mean, doesn't that make you feel part of something?  (No reply).  Sweetheart? Chloe? 
 CHLOE : I'm busy, mum. 
 TRISH : Okay.  (watches her for a few more seconds and then stands).  You're tired, Chloe. I heard you calling out again, last night. 
 CHLOE : It's fine. 
 TRISH : Nightmares? 
 CHLOE  (irritated): I'm drawing! 
 TRISH : Whatever they are... they're just dreams, you do know that? They can't hurt you. 
 CHLOE : I'm busy. Unless you want me to draw you... (She looks darkly at Trish) ... mum. 
 TRISH   (giving up):  If you wanna stay cooped up in here, fine. I'll leave you to it. 
 She leaves the bedroom, closing the door behind her. Chloe colours the cat in. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Rose is walking a few paces behind the Doctor, back in the close. 
 ROSE : Aren't you a beautiful boy?! 
 THE DOCTOR   (beams):  Thanks! I'm experimenting with back-combing. 
 Then he notices Rose is talking to a cat. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (disappointed):  Oh. 
 ROSE   (stroking it):  I used to have one like you. 
 The cat meows. The Doctor is watching uncomfortably, looking as though he has a nasty taste in his mouth. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (noticing):  What? 
 THE DOCTOR : No, I'm not really a cat person. Once you've been threatened by one in a nun's wimple, it kind of takes the joy out of it. 
 The cat wanders over to a cardboard box. 
 ROSE   (following):  Come here, puss! 
 The Doctor has averted his eyes. The cat climbs inside the box. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : What do you wanna go in there for? 
 There is a whooshing sound, and the cat's meow echoes slightly as if fading into the distance. Rose peers inside the box, it is empty. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (urgently):  Doctor! 
 The Doctor hurries over to her. Rose hurriedly stands up as the smell hits her. 
 THE DOCTOR   (backing off):  Whoa! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
 He waves the smell away and picks up the empty cardboard box. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Iron residue. Blimey! That takes some doing!  (Turns the box around, impressed).  Just to snatch a living organism out of space / time. This baby is just like,  (puts on rough accent)  "I'm 'avin' some of that", I'm impressed. 
 ROSE : So the cat's been transported? 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe is watching them through the window. 
 THE DOCTOR : It can harness huge reserves of ionic power. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (pointing):  We need to find the source of that power.  (Looks around) 
 Find the source and you will find... whatever has taken to stealing children and fluffy animals. See what you can see.  (Whacks Rose on the shoulder, gestures his eyes).  Keep 'em peeled, Lewis. 
 Rose nods as the Doctor walks off. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe is alone in her bedroom, sitting at her desk and apparently talking to herself. 
 CHLOE   (complaining):  I've given you friends and you still moan. Moan, moan, moan. You're lucky. You're all together.  (Looks round at all the woe-begone children in the drawings on the wall).  You don't know what it is to be alone. If you did, you'd be thanking me. 
 She pulls more paper towards her, obviously irritated. She starts to draw, pressing the pencil into the paper just a little too hard, and the lead snaps. 
 CHLOE (CONT'D)   (frustrated):  No! 
 She scribbles randomly on the paper in her annoyance. 
 INT. CUL-DE-SAC 
 Rose is alone and walking down what appears to be a dead end. The neighbourhood is eerily quiet except from a dog barking. Something crashes from inside one of the garages, causing Rose to turn. The initial crash is followed by several smaller ones as she approaches the garage door. 
 ROSE : Is that you, puss-cat? Are you trapped? 
 There is the sound of something metal rolling along the floor from within. Rose puts her ear against the door, but jumps back almost immediately at the sound of another crash. She considers the door. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (under her breath):  Not gonna open it, not gonna open it. Not gonna open it... 
 And she opens it. Slowly, tentatively... she looks inside and is immediately ambushed by what resembles a very violent tangle of wires, making a strange buzzing sound. Rose falls backwards. The Doctor appears round the corner in the nick of time and starts running as soon as he sees she's in trouble.  
 THE DOCTOR : Stay still! 
 He points his sonic screwdriver at the giant scribble, and it convulses, collapsing into a small ball which falls into Rose's outstretched hands. The Doctor rushes to Rose and stands over her. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Okey dokey? 
 He holds out his hands and pulls Rose to her feet. 
 ROSE   (slightly out of breath):  Yeah, cheers. 
 THE DOCTOR : No probs. 
 They have a quick hug before returning their attention to the object in Rose's hand. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me what the hell it is.  (Pokes it with the sonic screwdriver).  'Cos I haven't got the foggiest. 
 ROSE : Well, I can tell you you've just killed it. 
 THE DOCTOR   (taking it):  It was never living. It's animated by energy. Same energy that's snatching people.  (He throws it up and down, quite delighted).  That is so dinky! The Go-Anywhere creature. Fits in your pocket... makes friends, impresses the boss... breaks the ice at parties... 
 He pockets it. Rose laughs as they move off. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor has put the object on the TARDIS console for analysing. 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh, hi ho, here we go. Let's have a look. 
 The Doctor and Rose are watching the computer screen, which is displaying Gallifreyan symbols. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (surprised):  Get out of here... 
 ROSE : What's it say? 
 As if to confirm what he has just seen, the Doctor takes a pencil from his pocket and holds the object out in front of him. He uses the rubber (eraser) at the end of the pencil to rub out part of the object. 
 THE DOCTOR : It is!  (he blows it).  It's graphite! Basically the same material as an HB pencil. 
 ROSE : I was attacked by a... pencil scribble? 
 THE DOCTOR : Scribble creature.  (Sniffs it, then lets Rose sniff it).  Brought into being with ionic energy. Whatever we're dealing with, it can create things as well as take them. But... why make a scribble creature?! 
 ROSE : Maybe it was a mistake... I mean, you scribble over something when you wanna get rid of it. Like a um... like a drawing. Like a... a  (look of realisation)  child's drawing.  (Doctor glances at her).  You said it was in the street. 
 THE DOCTOR : Probably... 
 ROSE : The girl. 
 THE DOCTOR : Of course! ... What girl? 
 ROSE : Something about her gave me the creeps... even her own mum looked scared of her. 
 THE DOCTOR   (leaning in):  Are you deducting? 
 ROSE   (conspiratorial look):  I think I am. 
 THE DOCTOR : Copper's hunch? 
 ROSE : Permission to follow it up, sarge. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 We see the vague figures of the Doctor and Rose through the glass of Trish's front door as they ring the doorbell. Trish considers for a moment, suspicious, they rap on the letter box. Trish opens the door. They give her friendly smiles. 
 THE DOCTOR : Hello! I'm the Doctor and this is Rose. Can we see your daughter? 
 TRISH : No! You can't. 
 THE DOCTOR : Okay! Bye. 
 They walk away in silence, waiting, and sure enough. 
 TRISH : Why? 
 They turn in unison. 
 TRISH (CONT'D) : Why do you want to see Chloe? 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, there's some interesting stuff going on in this street, and I just thought, well, we thought, that she might like to give us a hand. 
 ROSE : Sorry to bother you. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah, sorry. We'll let you get on with things. On your own. Bye again! 
 They turn and walk away again, but Trish does not close the door. And after a few moments... 
 TRISH : Wait! 
 The Doctor and Rose turn again. The expression on Trish's face is helpless, vulnerable. 
 TRISH (CONT'D) : Can you help her? 
 The Doctor smiles. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes, I can. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, SITTING ROOM 
 Inside Trish's sitting room, footage of the Olympic Torch Bearer is on the TV. 
 COMMENTATOR : The Torch Bearer is running up towards the mall, which I can tell you is... 
 Rose sits herself down on the sofa while the Doctor flings his coat down next to her. 
 TRISH : She stays in her room, most of the time. I try talking to her, but it's like trying to speak to a brick wall. She gives me nothing, just asks to be left alone. 
 ROSE : What about Chloe's dad? 
 TRISH : Chloe's dad died a year ago. 
 ROSE : I'm sorry. 
 TRISH : You wouldn't be if you'd known him. 
 THE DOCTOR   (brightly):  Well! Let's go and say hi! 
 TRISH   (hesitant):  I should check on her first... she might be asleep. 
 THE DOCTOR : Why are you afraid of her, Trish? 
 TRISH : I want you to know before you see her that's she's really a great kid. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm sure she is. 
 TRISH : She's never been in trouble at school... you should see her report from last year. As and Bs. 
 She smiles at Rose, proud. Rose smiles back. 
 ROSE : Can I use your loo? 
 Trish nods. The Doctor watches Rose closely as she leaves the room . 
 TRISH   (to the Doctor):  She's in the choir... 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, STAIRS 
 Rose goes up the stairs, Trish's voice carrying. 
 TRISH (CONT'D) : She's singing in an old folks home. Any mum would be proud. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, SITTING ROOM 
 TRISH (CONT'D) : You know... I want you to know these things before you see her, Doctor. Because right now, she's not herself. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, LANDING 
 Rose emerges onto the landing. A shadow blocks out the light from the crack beneath Chloe's bedroom door, and there is the sound of movement from within. Rose hurriedly hides herself in a nearby airing cupboard, closing the ventilated doors on herself. She watches Chloe leave her room through the gaps and hears her footsteps on the stairs. She cautiously comes out of the airing cupboard, closing the doors as quietly as she can behind her. She now has her eyes on Chloe's bedroom door. She pushes it open and looks inside, observing the hundreds of drawings covering the walls. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Rose creeps further in, looking around. The wardrobe doors rattle and Rose gasps and jumps, causing her to knock a pencil holder onto the floor. She quickly picks them up and replaces them. Her gaze is drawn to a drawing of boy, baring his teeth at her, the boy was merely frowning a few moments ago. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, KITCHEN 
 The Doctor pops is head around the corner, looking through the dining room into the kitchen. 
 THE DOCTOR : All right, there? 
 Chloe is drinking some milk from the fridge. The Doctor walks into the kitchen, Trish behind him. He settles himself against a table as Chloe replaces the milk and closes the fridge door. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I'm the Doctor. 
 CHLOE   (facing him):  I'm Chloe Webber. 
 THE DOCTOR : How're you doing, Chloe Webber? 
 CHLOE : I'm busy. I'm making something. Aren't I, mum? 
 TRISH : And like I said, she's not been sleeping. 
 THE DOCTOR : But you've been drawing, though. I'm rubbish. Stick men are about my limit. Can do this, though... 
 He does the 'live long and prosper' sign from Star Trek. Chloe's face is expressionless. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Can you do that? 
 Trish nods at Chloe, encouraging her to answer. 
 CHLOE : They don't stop moaning. 
 TRISH : Chloe... 
 CHLOE : I try to help them, but they don't stop moaning. 
 THE DOCTOR   (quietly, lowers his hand):  Who don't? 
 CHLOE : We can be together. 
 TRISH   (moving towards her):  Sweetheart... 
 CHLOE : Don't touch me, mum. 
 Trish stops in her tracks, letting her hand fall back to her side. She and the Doctor glances at one another. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Rose jumps at the sound of the wardrobe doors rattling again. After a nervous glances around the room, she approaches the wardrobe slowly, steeling herself... then she opens them slowly, peering inside. A wind is rustling the clothes. She parts them to see the back of the wardrobe, and a red light floods the wardrobe and reflects off Rose's face. On the back of the wardrobe, there is a huge picture of a bearded man whose face is contorted with fury - the red light is coming from his glowing red eyes. This is Chloe's Dad. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming... 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, KITCHEN 
 CHLOE : I'm busy... Doctor. 
 She leaves. 
 THE DOCTOR   (calling after her, disappointed):  Oh, come on, Chloe! Don't be a spoil sport!  (He follows her back into the hallway).  What's the big project? I'm dying to know! What're you making up there? 
 ROSE   (terrified, from upstairs):  Doctor! 
 The Doctor lurches forwards and sprints up the stairs, Trish and Chloe following. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Rose is staring into the wardrobe as though transfixed when the Doctor runs into the room. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you... 
 The Doctor slams the wardrobe doors shut without so much as a glance at the inside. 
 ROSE : Look at it. 
 THE DOCTOR : No, ta. 
 He walks away to examine the drawings on the wall, putting his glasses on. 
 TRISH : What the hell was that? 
 ROSE : A drawing. The face of a man. 
 TRISH : What face? 
 She tries to open the doors but Rose rams herself up against them, stopping her. 
 ROSE : Best not. 
 TRISH  (to Chloe): What've you been drawing? 
 CHLOE : I'm drew him yesterday. 
 TRISH : Who? 
 CHLOE : Dad. 
 TRISH   (unpleasantly surprised and upset):  Your dad? But he's long gone. Chloe, with all the lovely things in the world, why him? 
 CHLOE : I dream about him, staring at me. 
 TRISH : I thought we were putting him behind us. What's the matter with you? 
 CHLOE : We need to stay together. 
 TRISH : Yes, we do. 
 CHLOE : No. Not you. Us. 
 The Doctor glances around at this. 
 CHLOE (CONT'D) : We need to stay together. And then it'll be all right. 
 Trish goes over to her, putting her hands on her daughter's cheeks. Chloe flinches. 
 ROSE : Trish, the drawings, have you seen what Chloe's drawings can do? 
 TRISH   (suddenly cold):  Who gave you permission to come into her room? Get out of my house.  THE DOCTOR : Tell us about the drawings, Chloe. 
 TRISH : I don't wanna here any more of this. 
 ROSE : But that drawing of her dad... I heard a voice. He spoke. 
 TRISH : He's dead. And these, they're kids pictures. Now get out! 
 ROSE : Chloe has a power. And I don't know how, but she used it to take Danny Edwards. Dale Hicks, she's using it to snatch the kids. 
 TRISH : Get out. 
 ROSE   (pleading):  Have you seen those drawings move? 
 TRISH   (derisively):  I haven't seen anything. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes you have. Out of the corner of your eye. 
 TRISH   (turning to him):  No. 
 THE DOCTOR : And you dismissed it, because what choice do you have when you see something you can't possibly explain?  (He moves over to her).  You dismiss it, right? And if anyone mentions it, you get angry, so it's never spoken of, ever ag... 
 TRISH : She's a child... 
 THE DOCTOR : And you're terrified of her. But there's no one to turn to, because who's gonna believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye? No one. Except me. 
 TRISH : Who are you? 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm help. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, KITCHEN 
 Back in the kitchen, the Doctor swipes a jar of marmalade off the worktop, unscrews the lid, dips his fingers into it and starts sucking the jam off. Rose clears her throat. He pauses, and Rose shakes her head at him, mouthing 'no'. The Doctor, looking for all the world like a naughty schoolboy caught red-handed, glances at Trish who is just staring at him. He meekly replaces the lid and pushes the jar behind him. 
 ROSE : Those pictures, they're alive. She's drawing people and they end up in her pictures. 
 THE DOCTOR : Ionic energy. Chloe's harnessing it to steal those kids and place them in some kid of holding-pen made up of ionic power. 
 ROSE : And what about the dad from hell in her wardrobe? 
 TRISH : How many times do I have to tell you? He's dead. 
 ROSE   (disbelieving):  Well, he's got a very loud voice for a dead bloke. 
 THE DOCTOR   (thinking):  If living things can become drawings, then maybe drawings can become living things... 
 He suddenly shivers violently, making Rose jump. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Chloe's real dad is dead, but not the one who visits her in her nightmares. That dad seems very real. That's the dad she's drawn and he's a heartbeat away from crashing into this world... 
 TRISH : She always got the worst of it when he was alive. 
 ROSE : Doctor, how can a twelve-year-old girl be doing any of this? 
 THE DOCTOR   (after a pause):  Let's find out. 
 He strides off. Rose follows. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 The Doctor, Rose and Trish enter Chloe's bedroom. She is sitting cross-legged on the bed. The Doctor stands before her, looking down at her. She says nothing, but does the "live long and prosper" sign. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nice one. 
 He kneels in front of her, holding her head in his hands, fingers on her temples. Her eyes roll in her head for a moment before closing. He closes his own eyes before suddenly Chloe falls backwards onto the bed. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : There we go... 
 TRISH   (moving towards them in her concern):  I can't let him do this... 
 ROSE   (stopping her, comforting):  Shh, it's okay. Trust him. 
 The Doctor straightens up. 
 THE DOCTOR   (addressing Chloe):  Now we can talk. 
 When Chloe speaks, her voice comes out as a strange whisper, and it's obviously not her. 
 CHLOE : I want Chloe. Wake her up. I want Chloe. 
 THE DOCTOR : Who are you? 
 CHLOE   (with passion):  I want Chloe Webber! 
 TRISH   (upset):  What've you done to my little girl? 
 ROSE : Doctor, what is it? 
 The Doctor walks slowly around the bed, all the while looking down at Chloe. 
 THE DOCTOR   (to "Chloe"):  I'm speaking to you. The entity that is using this human child. I request parlez in compliance with the Shadow Proclamation. 
 CHLOE : I don't care about shadows or parlez. 
 THE DOCTOR : So what do you care about? 
 CHLOE : I want my friends. 
 THE DOCTOR   (kneeling by her):  You're lonely, I know. Identify yourself. 
 CHLOE : I am one of many. I travel with my brothers and sisters. We take an endless journey. A thousand of your lifetimes. But now I am alone. I hate it. It's not fair. And I hate it! 
 Her eyes snap open. 
 THE DOCTOR : Name yourself! 
 CHLOE : Isolus. 
 THE DOCTOR   (as if this explains everything):  You're Isolus. Of course. 
 CHLOE : Our journey began in the Deep Realms when we were a family. 
 She is drawing on a piece of paper next to her on the bed whilst speaking. 
 TRISH   (looking at the drawing):  What's that? 
 The drawings begins to take shape. 
 THE DOCTOR : The Isolus Mother, drifting in Deep Space.  (Stands).  See, she jettisons millions of fledgling spores. Her children. The Isolus are empathic beings of intense emotions, but when they're cast off from their mother, their empathic link, their need for each other, is what sustains them. They need to be together. They cannot be alone. 
 CHLOE : Our journey is long. 
 THE DOCTOR : The Isolus children travel, each inside a pod. They ride the heat and energy of solar tides. It takes thousands and thousands of years for them to grow up. 
 ROSE : Thousands of years just floating through space... poor things, don't they go mad with boredom? 
 CHLOE : We play. 
 ROSE : You... play? 
 The Doctor sits down on the bed. 
 THE DOCTOR : Mm. While they travel, they play games. They use their ionic power to literally create make-believe worlds in which to play. 
 ROSE : In-flight entertainment. 
 THE DOCTOR : Helps keep them happy. While they're happy, they can feed off each others love. Without it, they're lost.  (He addresses Chloe / the Isolus again).  Why did you come to Earth?  CHLOE : We were too close. 
 She rips the piece of paper she is drawing on off the pad and starts anew. 
 THE DOCTOR   (looking at the drawing):  That's a solar flare from your sun. Would've made a tidal wave of solar energy that scattered the Isolus pods. 
 CHLOE : Only I fell to Earth. My brothers and sisters are left up there. And I cannot reach them. So alone. 
 THE DOCTOR : Your pod crashed... where is it? 
 CHLOE : My pod was drawn to heat... 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Flashback: Chloe drawing at her desk, sunlight pouring in through the window. 
 CHLOE (CONT'D)   (voice-over):  And I was drawn to Chloe Webber. 
 Chloe looks up as she sees the Isolus floating outside the bedroom window. She smiles, thinking it is pretty. 
 CHLOE (CONT'D   (voice-over) : She was like me. Alone. She needed me. And I her. 
 The Isolus enters Chloe through her mouth, making her gasp. End flashback. 
 
 
 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 The Doctor strokes Chloe's head. 
 THE DOCTOR : You empathised with her. You wanted to be with her because she was alone like you. 
 CHLOE : I want my family. It's not fair. 
 Rose and Trish watch this, obviously affected. 
 THE DOCTOR : I understand. You wanna make a family. But you can't stay in this child. It's wrong. You can't steal any more friends for yourself. 
 CHLOE : I am alone. 
 There is another thump from the wardrobe. Trish gasps. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you. 
 Chloe starts to shake and tremble in fear, although her face remains impassive. There is a pounding on the door of the wardrobe. 
 CHLOE'S DAD (CONT'D) : I'm coming. 
 THE DOCTOR : Trish, how do you calm her? 
 Chloe's body is jerking as though she is having a seizure. 
 TRISH : What?! 
 THE DOCTOR : When she has nightmares, what do you do? 
 TRISH : I... I... 
 THE DOCTOR  (urgently): What do you do? 
 TRISH : I sing to her. 
 THE DOCTOR : Then start singing. 
 He motions for Trish to come over. Trish takes his place next to Chloe. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe... I'm coming. 
 TRISH   (singing):  Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree, merry merry king of the bush is he... 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe... Chloe... 
 The banging and thumping on the door continues. The Doctor and Rose both look over at it, whilst Trish strokes Chloe's hair, trying to sooth her. 
 CHLOE'S DAD (CONT'D) : Chloe... Chloe... 
 [b]TRISH [/b]  (singing):  Laugh, Kookaburra laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. 
 The banging and the voice eventually fades. 
 TRISH (CONT'D)   (singing):  Laugh, Kookaburra laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. 
 Chloe is now asleep. 
 TRISH (CONT'D)   (in tears):  He came to her because she was lonely... Chloe, I'm sorry... 
 She buries her head in her little girl's shoulder, arms around her, sobbing. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, SITTING ROOM 
 Trish strides into the sitting room and starts gathering up all the pencils that are lying around. 
 TRISH : Chloe usually got the brunt of his temper. When he'd had a drink. The day he crashed the car, I thought we were free. 
 Rose hands her a bunch of pencils. 
 TRISH (CONT'D) : I thought it was over. 
 ROSE : Did you talk to her about it? 
 TRISH : I didn't want to. 
 Rose sits down. 
 ROSE : But... maybe that's why Chloe feels so alone. 'Cos she has all these terrible dreams about her dad, but she can't talk to you about them. 
 THE DOCTOR : Her an the Isolus... two lonely kids who need each other. 
 ROSE : And it won't stop, will it, Doctor? It'll just keep pulling kids in. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's desperate to be loved. It's used to a pretty big family. 
 ROSE : How big? 
 THE DOCTOR : Say around... four billion? 
 This draws a stunned silence from Rose and Trish. Rose turns her attention to the television. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe watches the TV on the laptop in her bedroom, again, it is on BBC News 24, showing footage of the Olympics. 
 COMMENTATOR : The queues started a week ago for those desperate enough to be inside, although lots of them expected a capacity crowd of eighty thousand... 
 A small sound from the wardrobe causes Chloe to look around. She stands and moves off. 
 COMMENTATOR (CONT'D) : For this evening's opening ceremony. I have to say there's been... 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 The Doctor shrugs into his coat as he and Rose leave Trish's house. 
 THE DOCTOR : We need that pod. 
 ROSE : It crashed, won't it be destroyed? 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, it's been sucking in all the heat it can... hopefully that should keep it in a fit state to launch. 
 Chloe is watching them through her bedroom window. Rose spots her outline. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : It must be close. It should have a weak energy signature that the TARDIS can trace. Once we find it, then we can stop the Isolus. 
 Chloe moves away from the window. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, SITTING ROOM 
 Trish is downstairs on the phone. 
 TRISH : She's running a temperature.  (Picks up a small bit of paper from the table).  I can't go into that now, Kirsty. Yes, we've got a doctor. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 Unbeknownst to Trish, Chloe quietly opens the front door and sneaks out. 
 TRISH (CONT'D) : Yeah, he said he can help her. 
 EXT. CAR PARK 
 The Doctor and Rose approach the TARDIS. 
 THE DOCTOR : We can scan for the same trace we picked up from the scribble creature. Just need to widen the field a bit. 
 He fishes in his pocket for the TARDIS key and opens the door. They go inside. Chloe watches from a distance, taking in the sight of the TARDIS. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor fumbles with some device, putting it together. Rose is sat in the chair next to the console. 
 ROSE : You knew the Isolus was lonely before it told you. How? 
 The Doctor shoves Rose off the chair and sits down on it himself. 
 THE DOCTOR : I know what it's like to travel a long way on your own. Give me the stina magnetic erm...  (he nods towards it violently)  thing in your left hand! 
 Rose glances at him, chewing on gum absent-mindedly. 
 ROSE : Sounds like you're on its side. 
 Rose slots the 'thing in her left hand' into the device whilst the Doctor holds it still between his legs.  
 THE DOCTOR : I sympathise, that's all. 
 ROSE : The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's a child!  (He blows on the device).  That's why it went to Chloe, two lonely mixed up kids. 
 He blows on it again, examining it. 
 ROSE : Hmm... feels to me like a temper tantrum because it can't get its own way. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's scared! Come on, you were a kid once. Binary dot. 
 ROSE   (handing him the binary dot):  Yes! And I know what kids can be like. Right little... terrors. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Back in her bedroom, Chloe reaches under her bed and takes out a doll. She pulls the head off, revealing the pencils stashed inside it. She takes them out, with the air of someone in a hurry. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR   (holding his hand out under Rose's mouth):  Gum. 
 Rose spits her gum out into his hand. 
 ROSE : I've got cousins. Kids can't have it all their own way. That's part of being a family. 
 The Doctor sticks the gum to the device, securing it. 
 THE DOCTOR : What about trying to understand them? 
 ROSE   (turning away with a slight smile):  Easy for you to say. You don't have kids. 
 THE DOCTOR   (off-handedly):  I was a dad once. 
 ROSE   (turns, shocked and stunned) : What did you say? 
 The Doctor doesn't seem to notice the effect his words had on Rose. He doesn't reply. 
 THE DOCTOR : I think we're there!  (He stands, goes to the console).  Fear. Loneliness. They're the big ones, Rose. Some of the most terrible acts ever committed have been inspired by them. We're not dealing with something that wants to conquer or destroy. 
 Rose is still reeling from the bombshell he just dropped, but he's carrying on oblivious, pulling levers and pressing buttons on the console. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : There's a lot of things you need to get across this universe.  (Indicates).  Warp drive... wormhole refractors... 
 Rose holds her hand out. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You know the thing you need most of all? You need a hand to hold. 
 He notices Rose's outstretched hand and takes it, grinning. 
 ROSE : No! Look, I'm pointing. 
 She laughs. The Doctor looks at the computer screen where she was pointing, a flashing white light on a map of the neighbourhood indicates the whereabouts of the pod. 
 THE DOCTOR   (excited):  It's the pod! It is in the street! Everything's coming up Doctor! 
 He scoots off towards the doors. Rose follows after a moment, still slightly distracted. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 In her bedroom, Chloe is drawing a picture of the TARDIS. 
 EXT. CAR PARK 
 The Doctor and Rose emerge from the TARDIS. The Doctor shuts the door behind him. 
 THE DOCTOR : Okay. It's about two inches across. Dull grey, like a gulls egg. Very light. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe is now drawing the Doctor. 
 ROSE   (voice-over):  So these pods, they travel from sun to sun using heat, yeah? 
 EXT. CAR PARK 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : So it's not all about love and stuff. Doesn't the pod just need heat? 
 A crash from behind her causes her to turn, the device she and the Doctor just constructed is shattered on the floor, and the Doctor has vanished. Rose's eyes widen in shock. 
 ROSE : Doctor? 
 The TARDIS has gone too. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Doctor? 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 Rose knocks on the door of Trish's house frantically. Trish opens the door, Rose barges past her and up the stairs. 
 TRISH   (following):  It's okay! I've taken all the pencils off her! 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Rose bursts into Chloe's bedroom. She crosses the room to the desk, swiping away the paper Chloe is drawing on and observing the TARDIS and the Doctor sketched onto it. 
 CHLOE   (with the Isolus' voice):  Leave me alone! I want to be with Chloe Webber! I love Chloe Webber! 
 ROSE : Bring him back, now. 
 CHLOE : No. 
 Rose turns away for a second, head in hands, and then very suddenly spins round and grabs Chloe by the shoulders. 
 ROSE   (viciously):  Don't you realise what you've done? He was the only one who could help you, now bring him back! 
 CHLOE : Leave me alone! I love Chloe Webber! 
 Rose's face softens. Trish watches. 
 ROSE   (gently):  I know.  (She stands).  I know. 
 She turns her attention to the paper she is holding. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Doctor, if you can hear me, I'm gonna get you out of there. I'll find the pod.  (To Trish).  Don't leave her alone, no matter what. 
 She leaves the room. 
 COMMENTATOR : ... the Torch Bearer getting even closer to the Olympic Stadium... before turning East along the embankment. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Kel smoothes down the road outside with the palm of his hand as Rose exits the house. 
 ROSE   (looking around):  Heat. They travel on heat. 
 KEL : Look at this finish. Smooth as a baby's bottom. 
 Rose hurries over to him. 
 KEL (CONT'D) : Not a bump or a lump. 
 ROSE   (crouching to speak to him):  Kel, was there anything in this street in the last few days giving off a lot of heat? 
 KEL   (not really listening):  I mean, you can eat your dinner off this. Beautiful. So you tell me why the other one's got a lump in it when I gave it the same love and craftsmanship I did this one 
 ROSE : Well, when you've worked it out, put it in a big book about tarmacking, but before you do that, think back six days. 
 KEL : Six days...  (He remembers).  When I was laying this the first time round! 
 ROSE : What? 
 KEL : Well, that's when I filled in this pothole for the first time. 
 ROSE   (thinking hard):  Six days ago...  (She's working it out).  Hot fresh tar... 
 KEL : Blended to a secret council recipe. 
 Without another word, Rose stands and runs to the van. 
 KEL (CONT'D)   (calling after her):  Ah... ah! I don't keep it in the van! 
 Rose wrenches open the doors. 
 KEL (CONT'D)   (striding towards her):  Ay, that's a council van. Out. 
 Rose ignores him and climbs inside, picking up an axe. She laughs with glee when she finds it, hopping out of the van again. 
 KEL (CONT'D) : Whoa, wait, wait, wait, you just removed a council axe from a council van. Put it back. No don't, wait, put the axe back in the van, that's my van, gimme the axe. 
 Rose swings the axe behind her, ready to bring it down hard on the road. 
 KEL (CONT'D) : No! Wait! No! 
 With a shout, Rose brings the axe crashing down the road, smashing through the tarmac. 
 KEL (CONT'D)   (yelling, bewildered):  No! You... stop! 
 Rose hacks at the road again. 
 KEL (CONT'D)   (outraged):  You just took a council axe, from a council van, and now you're digging up a council road! I'm reporting you to the council! 
 Rose scrabbles around the hole she just made, and finds the pod. 
 ROSE : It went for the hottest thing in the street. Your tar! 
 She laughs in delight. 
 KEL : What is it?! 
 ROSE : It's a spaceship! Not a council spaceship, I'm afraid. 
 She examines it. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe bars her bedroom door with a chair. She grabs some pencils from beneath the duvet cover, sits at her desk, pulls paper towards her and begins to draw. Her laptop is still showing the Olympics with a running commentary. Chloe begins to draw tiny faces on the paper, representing the crowds inside the Olympic stadium. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 Rose bursts in through the front door. 
 ROSE : I found it! 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, SITTING ROOM 
 Rose goes through to the sitting room, where Trish joins her. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I don't know what to do with it, but maybe the Isolus will just hop on board.  (Realises Trish is alone).  Hang on, I told you not to leave her! 
 COMMENTATOR : My God. Er, what's going on here? 
 They turn to the TV, the crowds inside the stadium have vanished, leaving it deserted. Kel appears at the living room door. 
 KEL : I don't care if you've got Snow White and the Seven Dwarves buried under there, you don't go digging up... 
 ROSE   (pointing at the TV):  Shut up and look! 
 COMMENTATOR : The crowd has vanished! Er... um... they're gone. Everyone has gone. Thousands of people have just gone. Er... um... right in front of my eyes. Um... it's impossible! Bob, can we join you, um, in the box?  (Silence - footage cuts to empty box).  Bob? Not you too, Bob? 
 ROSE : The stadium won't be enough. The Isolus has four billion brothers and sisters. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe watches the laptop in her room. 
 COMMENTATOR : Over eighty-thousand spectators and thirteen thousand athletes... 
 CHLOE : Not enough. 
 COMMENTATOR : Er... they're gone! All of those people. Er... it's a terrible, terrible turn of events... 
 She stands and rushes over to her shelves, grabs an atlas and some pencils. She opens the book at a diagram of the Planet Earth, blue and green pencils at the ready. 
 CHLOE   (whispers):  We won't be alone, Chloe Webber. We'll have all of them. And then we'll never feel alone. Ever again. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, LANDING 
 Rose charges up to Chloe's bedroom door holding the axe, Trish behind her. She tries the handle, but the chair is obstructing the door. 
 TRISH : Chloe? 
 ROSE   (urgently):  Chloe, it's Rose! Open the door!

 At the sound of their voices, Chloe rips her magazine cuttings off the wall, leaving a blank space. She starts to draw.

 TRISH : Chloe?! 
 ROSE : Open up!  (To Trish):  Right, stand back. 
 Trish does so.

 Rose swings the axe again and again, splintering the wood.

 Chloe begins to draw faster, as if hurrying to finish it. 
 CHLOE'S DAD (CONT'D) : I'm coming to hurt you... 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, LANDING 
 Having made a large enough hole in the door to fit her arm through, Rose knocks the chair out of the way and opens the door. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 She and Trish rush in. 
 ROSE : Chloe! 
 CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you... 
 Chloe is now colouring the land in green. 
 CHLOE'S DAD (CONT'D) : I'm coming... 
 ROSE : I've gotta stop her. 
 She starts forward but the wardrobe doors rattle particularly violently and she steps back. 
 CHLOE : If you stop Chloe Webber, I will let him out. We will let him out together. I cannot be alone. It's not fair. 
 Rose holds the pod out to her. 
 ROSE : Look, I've got your pod. 
 CHLOE : The pod is dead. 
 ROSE : It... it only needs heat. 
 CHLOE : It needs more than heat. 
 ROSE   (desperate):  What, then? 
 KEL   (who just joined them):  I'm not being funny or nothing, but that picture just moved. 
 Rose and Trish look where he is pointing. 
 KEL (CONT'D)   (pointing at the drawing of the Doctor and the TARDIS):  And that one! 
 Rose picks it up. There is now a simple sketch of the Olympic Torch next to the Doctor, and he is pointing to it. 
 ROSE : She didn't draw that. He did. But it needs more than heat, Doctor. 
 She looks at the picture, helpless. She turns her attention to the television, which is now showing the athlete running along the road with the Torch. 
 COMMENTATOR : It's much more than a torch now, it's a beacon. It's a beacon of hope and fortitude and courage. And it's a beacon of love. 
 ROSE   (with realisation):  Love. 
 COMMENTATOR : So let's have a look from the helicopter; there we go, the torch running... 
 ROSE : I know how to charge up the pod. 
 She leaves. Chloe is still colouring in the Earth. 
 COMMENTATOR : ... past Dame Kelly Holmes Close. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Rose jogs down the close, there are lots of people congregated at the end, cheering as the torch bearer passes by. Rose joins them, squeezing through to the front. A policeman stops her. 
 POLICEMAN : Sorry, you'll have to watch from here. 
 ROSE : No, I've gotta get closer... 
 POLICEMAN : No way! 
 ROSE : I can stop this from happening! 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe...

 CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you. 
 Trish addresses the shaking wardrobe, crying and out of her mind with anxiety, clutching at her head. 
 TRISH : My baby! You're not going to hurt her again! 
 CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 As the torch bearer passes by, the pod begins to chirp. 
 ROSE : You felt it, didn't you? 
 She backs out of the crowd and then brings her cupped hands close to her mouth, whispering to the pod. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Feel the love. 
 She throws it into the air and it is drawn to the torch. The torch bearer staggers slightly as it falls into the flames, but dismisses it. Rose jumps up and down with joy. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Yes! 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 Chloe has very nearly finished colouring in the Earth, when suddenly she stops, eyes wide. 
 CHLOE / ISOLUS : I can go home. Goodbye, Chloe Webber. I love you. 
 Chloe's eyes roll in her head as the tiny Isolus emerges from her mouth and zooms off through the window. As though she has just woken up, Chloe turns to Trish. 
 CHLOE (CONT'D) : Mum? 
 TRISH : I'm here. 
 CHLOE   (dropping her pencil):  Mummy! 
 Chloe rushes into her mother's arms and hugs her. Trish hugs her back, overjoyed. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Still cheering and whooping with delight, Rose throws her arms around Kel. 
 KEL : You did it!  (Confused).  What was it you did? 
 Rose grabs him again and spins him around, giggling and bouncing up and down. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 All the missing children materialise out of thin air, in the exact same spots from which they disappeared. Dale runs to his mother, hugging her. 
 DALE : Mummy! 
 Rose smiles and watches Jane run to her mother. 
 JANE'S MOTHER : Oh, Jane! 
 Rose is happy to see them reunited, but is slightly distant. 
 ROSE   (to herself):  Doctor... 
 She watches the happy families sadly, and jumps with Maeve touches her arm. 
 MAEVE : I don't know who you are, or what you did, but thank you, darling! 
 She kisses Rose's cheek. Rose laughs. 
 MAEVE (CONT'D) : And thank that man for me too! 
 She walks away. Rose scans the street with growing anxiety. 
 ROSE   (voice starting to shake):  Where is he? He should be here. 
 She watches the happy children playing on the street. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : All the drawings have come to life.  (Looks up at Chloe's bedroom window).  That means all of them. 
 A red light fills Chloe's room and we hear the sound of Chloe's Dad growling. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Oh, no. 
 She runs towards the house. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 Chloe and Trish are walking down the stairs together when the front door suddenly slams shut of its own accord. Trish tries to open it, but it is stuck fast. The other doors from the hallway slam shut too, leaving them trapped. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Rose rushes to the front door and bangs on it. 
 ROSE   (urgently, through the glass):  Trish, get out! 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 TRISH : I can't! The door's stuck! 
 ROSE : Is the Doctor in there? 
 TRISH : I don't think so! 
 CHLOE   (scared):  Mummy... 
 Dust is shaken from the ceiling as the sound of heavy footsteps is heard overhead, accompanied by the red light. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe, I'm coming to hurt you... 
 CHLOE   (plaintive):  Please, dad. No more. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe... 
 ROSE   (speaking fast):  Chloe, listen to me. It isn't real like the others. It's just energy left over by the Isolus, but you can get rid of it... 
 TRISH   (banging on the door):  Help us! 
 ROSE : Oh it's 'cos you're so scared that he's real! But you can get shot of him, Chloe! 
 CHLOE   (casting terrified looks over her shoulder):  Mummy! 
 ROSE : You can do it, Chloe! 
 CHLOE : I can't! 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, CHLOE'S BEDROOM 
 There is a shadow of a man on Chloe's bedroom wall. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe... I'm coming... 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 CHLOE : I can't... 
 She sinks to the bottom of the door, hunched up and terrified, giving up. 
 CHLOE (CONT'D) : I can't. 
 The shadow appears on the wall of the landing. 
 CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming... 
 CHLOE : Mummy... 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe... 
 TRISH   (putting her arms around her):  I'm with you, Chloe. You're not alone. You'll never be alone again. 
 ROSE   (pounding on the door):  Sing again! Chloe, sing 
 CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe... 
 Chloe begins to sing the Kookaburra song again, but it can barely be heard over Chloe's Dad's roars, his shadow coming closer. 
 CHLOE'S DAD (CONT'D) : Chloe... Chloe... Chloe... Chloe, I'm coming to hurt you. 
 Trish joins her in the song. 
 CHLOE'S DAD (CONT'D) : Chloe! 
 As their voices become stronger, his becomes weaker. His shadow retreats and the light fades. He roars with anger, but it sounds distant. 
 CHLOE / TRISH   (laughing with relief, singing):  ... merry merry king of the bush is he... 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Rose, sighing with relief, slides down the door, sinking to the ground. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, HALLWAY 
 CHLOE / TRISH : Laugh, Kookaburra laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. 
 They look at each other, smiling. 
 EXT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 Outside, Kel approaches a desolate Rose. 
 KEL : Maybe he's gone somewhere. 
 ROSE  (so sad): Who's gonna hold his hand now? 
 Kel doesn't know what to say. 
 INT. WEBBERS' HOUSE, SITTING ROOM 
 Back in the sitting room, Trish and Chloe watch the TV, the crowds have returned to the stadium. 
 COMMENTATOR : Just look at this! Utterly incredibly scenes at the Olympics stadium, eighty thousand athletes and spectators, they disappeared, they've come back! 
 They look up as Rose and Kel enter to watch. 
 COMMENTATOR (CONT'D) : They've returned. They've reappeared. It's quite incredible. Bob, this will certainly... 
 ROSE   (completely lost):  Eighty thousand people, so where's the Doctor...?  (close to tears).  I need him. 
 COMMENTATOR : The torch bearer seems to be in a bit of trouble. We did see a flash of lightening earlier which seemed to strike him... erm, maybe he's injured... he's definitely in trouble. 
 The torch bearer collapses. 
 COMMENTATOR (CONT'D) : Does this mean that the Olympic Dream is dead? 
 A familiar brown-clad arm picks up the torch. 
 ROSE   (a smile spreading across her face):  Doctor... 
 The Doctor starts to run with the torch alongside the crowds. 
 COMMENTATOR : There's a mystery man, he's picked up the flame... we've no idea who he is... erm... he's carrying the flame, yes! He's carrying the flame and no one wants to stop him. 
 Kel, Trish and Chloe smile as Rose laughs in relief and joy. 
 COMMENTATOR (CONT'D) : It's more than a flame now, Bob. It's more than heat and light. It's hope. And it's courage. And it's love. 
 EXT. OLYMPIC STADIUM 
 The Doctor runs up the red carpeted stairs with the torch, the spot light following him. The Doctor faces the crowds with a huge grin on his face, whooping. He lights the Olympic Flame. 
 THE DOCTOR : Go on. Join your brothers and sisters. They'll be waiting. 
 The crowd scream and cheer. The Isolus, unseen by anyone except the Doctor, rises up into the air and away into the night. 
 INT. DAME KELLY HOLMES CLOSE 
 The Doctor walks back down Dame Kelly Holmes Close, hands in his pocket. Rose creeps up behind him with a cheeky grin on her face. 
 ROSE : Cake? 
 The Doctor turns. She's holding out a cupcake decorated with edible ball bearings. He starts to laugh, as does she. 
 THE DOCTOR   (taking it):  Top banana! 
 He takes a bite out of it whilst Rose watches, grinning from ear to ear . 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Mm. I can't stress this enough. Ball bearings you can eat, masterpiece! 
 Rose watches him for a few more seconds and then throws her arms around him, holding him tight. 
 ROSE : Ooh, I thought I'd lost you. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nah! Not on a night like this! This is a night for lost things being found. Come on! 
 They walk down the road together. 
 ROSE : What now? 
 THE DOCTOR : I wanna go to the games! What we came for! 
 ROSE : Go on, give us a clue, which events do we do well in? 
 THE DOCTOR   (mouth still full of cake):  Well, I will tell you this: Papua New Guinea surprises everyone in the shot put. 
 ROSE : ... Really? You're joking, aren't you?  (She giggles).  Doctor, are you serious or are you joking? 
 THE DOCTOR : Wait and see! 
 Fireworks explode overhead as the Doctor and Rose walk down the street, hand in hand. 
 ROSE : You know what; they keep on trying to split us up, but they never ever will. 
 The Doctor looks at her, coming to a halt. 
 THE DOCTOR : Never say never ever. 
 ROSE   (with confidence):  Nah. We'll always be okay, you and me.  (No reply).  Don't you reckon, Doctor? 
 The Doctor looks skywards, reflecting for a moment, as though he senses something. 
 THE DOCTOR : Something in the air. Something coming. 
 ROSE : What? 
 The Doctor and Rose look up at the sky, which is lit up with fireworks. 
 THE DOCTOR : A storm's approaching. 
 Rose glances at him nervously and shivers.
