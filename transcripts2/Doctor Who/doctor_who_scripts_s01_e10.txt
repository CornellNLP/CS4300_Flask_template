 A recap of 1x09 "The Empty Child". 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 The gas-mask people are surrounding Rose, the Doctor and Jack. Then - the Doctor stares sternly around at them. 
 THE DOCTOR   (as though addressing a disobedient child)  :  Go to your room. 
 The gasmask people hesitate. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Jamie hesitates. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Go to your room! 
 The gas-mask people cock their heads to one side. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Jamie cocks his head to one side. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 Rose and Jack look at one another. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I mean it! I am very, very angry with you. I am very, very cross! Go... to... your... ROOM! 
 He points violently in no particular direction, and miraculously, all the gas-mask people turn meekly away. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Jamie turns to leave. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 The patients and staff in the hospital climb back onto their beds. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Jamie slowly opens the door and leaves the room. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 The Doctor sighs with relief. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I'm really glad that worked. Those would've been TERRIBLE last words. 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 EXT. STREET 
 Jamie walks alone from the house into the dark night. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Nancy watches him go from the window. 
 NANCY   (sadly) : Jamie... 
 She sinks to the ground with her back against the wall, and sobs. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 Rose is sitting by one of the beds, looking at one of the gasmask people. Jack settles down in a chair. 
 ROSE : Why are they all wearing gas masks? 
 JACK : They're not. Those masks are flesh and bone. 
 THE DOCTOR : How was your con supposed to work? 
 JACK : Simple enough, really. Find some harmless piece of space-junk... let the nearest Time Agent track it back to Earth. Convince him it's valuable, name a price. When he's put 50% up front, oops! A German bomb falls on it, destroys it forever. He never gets to see what he's paid for. Never knows he's been had. I buy him a drink with his own money, and we discuss dumb luck. The perfect self-cleaning con. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah. Perfect. 
 JACK : The London Blitz is great for self-cleaners, Pompeii's nice if you want to make a vacation of it though, but you've got to set your alarm for volcano day. 
 He laughs at his own joke. The Doctor merely looks at him. Jack's laughter dies away. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Getting a hint of disapproval. 
 THE DOCTOR : Take a look around the room. This is what your "harmless piece of space-junk" did. 
 JACK : It was a burnt-out medical transporter, it was empty. 
 The Doctor looks darkly at him and walks off. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose. 
 ROSE : We getting out of here? 
 THE DOCTOR : We're going upstairs. 
 Rose follows him. Jack gets up and calls after him. 
 JACK : I even programmed the flight computer so it wouldn't land on anything living, I harmed no-one! I don't know what's happening here, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'll tell you what's happening. You forgot to set your alarm clock. It's volcano day. 
 A siren goes off in the distance. 
 ROSE : What's that? 
 JACK : The all-clear. 
 THE DOCTOR : I wish. 
 He leaves the ward. Rose and Jack follow him. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Upon hearing the siren, Nancy gets up and leaves the dining room. 
 INT. HALLWAY 
 Suddenly, a child wearing a gas-mask jumps out in front of her, and she screams and stumbles backwards - but then the little boy takes the mask off. 
 NANCY : I thought you were Jamie! 
 She leaves the house through the back door, the boy following her. 
 EXT. GARDEN 
 BOY : Dad! Dad! 
 Mr and Mrs Lloyd appear and Mr Lloyd angrily tries to shove her back into the house. 
 NANCY : Get your hands off me! 
 MRS LLOYD   (to the boy):  Oi! You! Get in! Get in! 
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
 Rose and Jack run down a corridor looking for the Doctor. 
 JACK   (calls):  Mr Spock? 
 ROSE   (calls) : Doctor? 
 They dash past a flight of stairs. The Doctor pops his head around the banister. 
 THE DOCTOR : Have you got a blaster? 
 Rose and Jack skid to a halt and backtrack. 
 JACK : Sure! 
 They run up the stairs and find themselves standing outside a door. 
 THE DOCTOR : The night your space-junk landed, someone was hurt. This was where they were taken. 
 ROSE : What happened? 
 THE DOCTOR : Let's find out.  (To Jack):  Get it open. 
 Jack grins and points a blaster at the door. The Doctor stands back, beside Rose. 
 ROSE   (quietly):  What's wrong with your sonic screwdriver? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nothing. 
 Jack's blaster cuts a perfectly square hole around the lock of the door and it squeaks open. 
 THE DOCTOR : Sonic blaster, 51st century. Weapon Factories of Villengard? 
 JACK : You've been to the factories? 
 THE DOCTOR   (taking the blaster from Jack for a look):  Once. 
 JACK : Well, they gone now. Destroyed. The main reactor went critical. Vapourized the lot. 
 THE DOCTOR   (giving the blaster back):  Like I said, once. There's a banana grove there, now. I like bananas. Bananas are good. 
 He smiles pleasantly at Jack and enters the room. Rose goes up to Jack. 
 ROSE   (looks at the perfectly square hole):  Nice blast pattern. 
 JACK : Digital. 
 ROSE : Squareness gun. 
 JACK : Yeah. 
 ROSE : I like it. 
 She goes into the room. Jack laughs, then follows her. 
 INT. THE ROOM 
 The Doctor switches a light on. The room looks as though it has been vandalised. The window is broken and there is stuff all over the floor. 
 THE DOCTOR : What d'you think? 
 JACK : Something got out of here... 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah. And? 
 JACK : Something powerful. Angry. 
 THE DOCTOR : Powerful and angry. 
 Jack enters a room off the side. The floors and walls are covered with a child's drawings. There are a few toys on the floor and a little bed in the corner. 
 JACK : A child? I suppose this explains "mummy". 
 ROSE : How could a child do this? 
 The Doctor plays a tape of Doctor Constantine talking to the Child. 
 DR. CONSTANTINE : Do you know where you are? 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 DR. CONSTANTINE : Are you aware of what's around you? Can you... see? 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 DR. CONSTANTINE : What do you want? Do you know... 
 THE CHILD : I want my mummy. Are you my mummy? I want my mummy! Are you my mummy? 
 Every single one of the drawings covering the wall are of the Child's mother. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Are you my mummy? Mummy? Mummy? 
 ROSE : Doctor, I've heard this voice before. 
 THE DOCTOR : Me too. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 ROSE : Always, "are you my mummy?". Like he doesn't know. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 ROSE : Why doesn't he know? 
 THE CHILD : Are you there, mummy? Mummy? 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Mr Lloyd enters the dining room and shuts the door behind him. He leans on the table, at which Nancy is sitting. 
 MR LLOYD : The police are on their way. I pay for the food on this table. The sweat on my brow, that food is. The sweat on my brow. Anything else you'd like? I've got a whole house here, anything else you'd like to help yourself to? 
 NANCY : Yeah. I'd like some wire cutters, please. 
 Mr Lloyd looks unpleasantly surprised. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : Something that can cut through barbed wire. Oh, and a torch. Don't look like that, Mr Lloyd. I know you've got plenty of tools in here. I've been watching this house for ages. And I'd like another look round your kitchen cupboards. I was in a hurry the first time. I wanna see if there's anything I missed. 
 MR LLOYD : The food on this table... 
 NANCY : It's an awful lot of food, isn't it, Mr Lloyd? 
 Mr Lloyd's mouth opens and shuts again. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : A lot more than on anyone else's table. Half this street thinks your missus must be messing about with Mr. Avistock, the butcher. But she's not, is she? You are. 
 Mr Lloyd looks very uncomfortable, and he is starting to sweat. Triumphant, Nancy stands up. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : Wire cutters. Torch. Food. And I'd like to use your bathroom before I leave, please. Oh, look...  there's  the sweat on your brow. 
 Mr Lloyd agitatedly wipes the beads of sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. Nancy goes over to the door and opens it. 
 INT. THE ROOM 
 The reels of the tape spin. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? Please, mummy? Mummy? 
 The Doctor is pacing around the room. 
 ROSE : Doctor? 
 THE DOCTOR : Can you sense it? 
 JACK : Sense what? 
 THE DOCTOR : Coming out of the walls, can you feel it? 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 The Doctor stops to look around at Rose and Jack. 
 THE DOCTOR : Funny little human brains, how do you get around in those things? 
 ROSE   (to Jack):  When he's stressed, he likes to insult species. 
 THE DOCTOR   (still pacing) : Rose, I'm thinking. 
 ROSE : Cuts himself shaving, does half an hour in life forms he's cleverer than... 
 THE DOCTOR : There are these children living rough around the bomb site. They come out during air-raids looking for food. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy, please? 
 THE DOCTOR : Suppose they were there when this thing, whatever it was, landed? 
 JACK : It was a med-ship. It was harmless. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes, you keep saying. "Harmless". Suppose one of them was affected, altered? 
 ROSE : Altered how? 
 THE CHILD : I'm here! 
 THE DOCTOR : It's afraid. Terribly afraid, and powerful. It doesn't know it yet, but it will do.  (Small laugh).  It's got the power of a god, and I just sent it to its room. 
 There is a loud, crackling noise filling the room. 
 ROSE   (scared):  Doctor... 
 THE CHILD : I'm here. Can't you see me? 
 ROSE : What's that noise? 
 THE DOCTOR   (smile fading):  End of the tape. It ran out about 30 seconds ago. 
 THE CHILD : I'm here, now. Can't you see me? 
 THE DOCTOR : I sent it to it's room. This is its room. 
 He spins around and the Child is standing by the tape machine. 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy?  (Cocks his head on one side, considering Rose).  Mummy? 
 ROSE : Doctor? 
 JACK : Okay... on my signal... make for the door. Now! 
 He violently produces a banana and points it threateningly at the Child. The Doctor grins and produces Jack's sonic blaster, blasting a square hole in the wall. 
 THE DOCTOR : Go! Now! Don't drop the banana! 
 JACK   (hopping through the hole in the wall with Rose and the Doctor):  Why not?! 
 THE DOCTOR : Good source of potassium! 
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
 The three of them find themselves back in a corridor. The Child approaches them from inside the room. 
 JACK   (grabbing his sonic blaster off the Doctor):  Give me that! 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 Jack points the blaster at the wall, and it rebuilds itself, blocking the Child out. 
 JACK : Digital rewind.  (Tosses banana back to the Doctor).  Nice switch. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's from the Groves of Villengard. I thought it was appropriate. 
 JACK : There's really a banana grove in the heart of Villengard and you did that? 
 THE DOCTOR   (simply) : Bananas are good. 
 The Child thumps the wall from the other side, cracking it. 
 ROSE : Doctor! 
 THE DOCTOR : Come on! 
 They rush down a short flight of stairs and down another corridor, before they encounter all the patients bursting out of the ward calling "mummy". They hastily backtrack, but they find the gasmask people coming from that direction too. They find themselves back at the point where they started, where the Child is breaking through the wall. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's keeping us here so it can get at us. 
 JACK   (points the blaster in each direction in term):  It's controlling them? 
 THE DOCTOR : It is them. It's every living thing in this hospital. 
 JACK : Okay. This can function as a sonic blaster, a sonic cannon, and a triple-enfolded sonic disrupter. Doc, what you got? 
 The Doctor takes the sonic screwdriver out of his pocket, but Jack is not looking as he is too busy brandishing his sonic device at the gasmask people. 
 THE DOCTOR : A sonic, er... oh, never mind. 
 JACK : What? 
 The Doctor turns to face the other group of gasmask people, switching on his sonic screwdriver. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that. 
 JACK : Disrupter? Cannon? What? 
 THE DOCTOR : It's sonic! Totally sonic! I am sonic-ed up! 
 JACK : A sonic what?! 
 THE DOCTOR : SCREWDRIVER! 
 Jack spins around. At that moment, the Child finally manages to punch through the wall. He begins to climb through the hole. Rose grabs onto Jack's wrist and makes him point the sonic blaster at the floor. 
 ROSE : Going down! 
 She blasts a hole in the floor. They all fall in a messy heap on the floor of the ward below. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 
 Jack hurriedly activates the digital rewind, closing the hole so they cannot be followed. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Doctor, are you okay? 
 THE DOCTOR : Could've used a warning...! 
 ROSE : Ugh, the gratitude. 
 They get up and brush themselves off. 
 JACK : Who has a sonic screwdriver? 
 THE DOCTOR :l  I do! 
 ROSE   (looking around):  Light! 
 JACK : Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks "oohoo, this could be a little more sonic"? 
 THE DOCTOR   (indignantly)  :  What, you've never been bored? 
 ROSE   (still poking around):  There's gotta be a light switch! 
 THE DOCTOR : Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up? 
 Rose finally finds a switch and turns the lights on. All the gas-mask people lying in the beds sit up and start calling "mummy". 
 JACK : Door. 
 They rush to the door as the patients start getting out of bed. Finding it locked, Jack tries to blast it open but his sonic blaster doesn't work. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Damn it! 
 He steps back, allowing the Doctor to use his sonic screwdriver instead. He whacks the sonic blaster angrily. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : It's the special features, they really drain the battery. 
 ROSE : The battery?! 
 The Doctor opens the door and they dash through it. 
 ROSE : That's so lame. 
 INT. STOREROOM 
 The Doctor slams the door shut behind them and locks it with his sonic screwdriver. 
 JACK   (running to the window):  I was gonna send for another one, but somebody's gonna blow up the factory. 
 He glares at the Doctor. 
 ROSE : Oh, I know, first day I met him, he blew my job up. That's practically how he communicates. 
 THE DOCTOR : Okay, that door should hold it for a bit. 
 JACK : The door?! The wall didn't stop it! 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, it's gotta find us first! Come on, we're not done yet! Assets, assets! 
 JACK : Well, I've got a banana, and at a pinch you could put up some shelves. 
 THE DOCTOR   (going to the window):  Window... 
 JACK : Barred, sheer drop outside. Seven stories. 
 ROSE : And no other exits. 
 JACK   (settling comfortably into a chair):  Well, the assets conversation went in a flash, didn't it? 
 The Doctor turns and eyes him for a moment, then looks at Rose. 
 THE DOCTOR : So, where'd you pick this one up, then? 
 ROSE   (warningly):  Doctor... 
 JACK : She was hanging from a barrage balloon, I had an invisible spaceship. I never stood a chance. 
 Rose looks ever so slightly uncomfortable. 
 THE DOCTOR : Okay, one, we want to get out of here. Two, we can't get out of here. Have I missed anything? 
 Rose looks in Jack's direction. 
 ROSE   (in wonder) : Yeah... Jack just disappeared. 
 The Doctor spins around to see Jack's empty chair. 
 INT. OUTHOUSE 
 Jim types on a typewriter. The other children are all crowded inside with him. Nancy enters. 
 NANCY : Thought as much. What are all of you doing here? Different house every night, I told ya! 
 JIM : We thought you were dead! Or you'd run off. 
 ERNIE : I didn't. I knew you'd come back for us. 
 Nancy squats down and empties her bag of supplies on the floor. Ernie looks at Jim with the typewriter. 
 ERNIE : Found that old thing in the junk. Thinks he can write now... 
 JIM : I'm writing a letter to me dad. 
 ERNIE : You don't even know where your dad is .  And how're you gonna send it? 
 JIM   (as though this is a ridiculous question) : I dunno, stick it in an enveloppe? 
 ERNIE : You can't even read or write. 
 JIM : I don't need to, I've got a machine! 
 The typewriter pings. 
 NANCY   (harshly, irritated):  Will you stop making that noise! 
 A short silence. Jim looks crestfallen and Nancy's face softens. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : I'm sorry, Jim. On you go. You write a letter to your dad if you want to. 
 Jim continues typing. 
 ERNIE   (to Nancy) : I know we should've went somewhere else, but we need you, see. For the thinking. 
 NANCY : And what if I wasn't here? What if one night, I didn't come back for you? There's a war on... people go out... they don't always come back. It happens. What would you do then? 
 Ernie furrows his brow, then takes the wire cutters from Nancy's hands. 
 ERNIE : Are they wire cutters?! 
 NANCY   (standing, taking them back):  I need you to think about that. Someone's gotta look after this lot! 
 ERNIE : Why? Are you going somewhere? 
 NANCY   (putting the wire cutters into her bag):  The bomb site. The one at the railway station. 
 ERNIE   (shocked):  Why? 
 NANCY : The Child. That's where he was killed. That's where it all started. And I'm gonna find out how. 
 ERNIE   (frightened)  :  He'll get you! And then he'll come for us, he always comes for us! 
 NANCY : No. Ernie, he doesn't. He always comes after me .  There are things I haven't told ya... things I can't tell ya. As long as you're with me... you're in danger. Even now, sitting here, you're in danger because of me. 
 ERNIE : You're the one that keeps us safe! 
 NANCY : You think so, Ernie? Then answer this: Jim is sitting there right next to ya. So who's typing? 
 The steady clicking of the typewriter continues, but no one is typing. It types words on the paper. The children look scared. When it stops, Nancy rips the paper out. 
 ERNIE   (urgently) : Is he coming? 
 NANCY : Ernie... as long as you're with me... he's always coming. 
 She turns to leave, dropping the piece of paper on the floor. She stops at the door. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : Plenty of greens. And chew your food. 
 She leaves. Ernie picks up the piece of paper and reads it. Underneath Jims incoherent jumble of letters and numbers, is typed the phrase "ARE YOU MY MUMMY", repeatedly. 
 INT. STOREHAND 
 Rose approaches the Doctor who is now sitting down and puts her hand casually on the back of his chair. 
 ROSE : Okay, so he's vanished into thin air. Why is it always the great looking ones who do that? 
 The Doctor peers up at her, giving her a look. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm making an effort not to be insulted. 
 ROSE   (waving her hand dismissively):  I mean... men. 
 THE DOCTOR   (smiling sarcastically):  Okay. Thanks. That really helped. 
 An old radio springs to life and Jack's voice transmits through it. 
 JACK : Rose? Doctor? Can you hear me? 
 They both hurry over to the radio, the Doctor picking it up. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : I'm back on my ship. 
 INT. JACK'S SHIP 
 On his ship, in the pilot's seat. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Used the emergency teleport. Sorry I couldn't take you. 
 INT. STOREROOM 
 The Doctor, in some confusion, holds the wires that have been ripped out of the radio. 
 INT. JACK'S SHIP 
 JACK : It's security-keyed to my molecular structure. I'm working on it, hang in there. 
 He twists a few knobs on the controls on his spaceship. 
 THE DOCTOR : How're you speaking to us? 
 JACK : Om-Com. I can call anything with a speaker grille. 
 INT. STOREROOM 
 THE DOCTOR : Now there's a coincidence. 
 JACK : What is? 
 THE DOCTOR : The Child can Om-Com too. 
 ROSE : It can? 
 THE DOCTOR   (nods):  Anything with a speaker grille. Even the TARDIS phone. 
 ROSE : What, you mean the Child can phone us? 
 THE CHILD   (through radio, singsong voice) : And I can hear you. Coming to find you. Coming to fiiiiind you. 
 JACK : Doctor, can you hear that? 
 THE DOCTOR : Loud and clear. 
 JACK : I'll try to block out the signal. Least I can do. 
 THE CHILD : Coming to find you, mummy! 
 INT. JACK'S SHIP 
 JACK : Remember this one, Rose? 
 He flicks a switch, and Glenn Miller's "Moonlight Serenade" plays through the radio. 
 INT. STOREROOM 
 Rose looks ever so slightly uncomfortable as the Doctor turns to look at her questioningly. 
 ROSE   (a little embarrassed):  Our song. 
 The Doctor nods, but it seems as though he doesn't like this. Rose shifts from foot to foot, smiling embarrassedly. 
 EXT. CRASH SITE ENCLOSURE (OUTSIDE THE WIRE) 
 Nancy approaches the bomb site, which has a sign on the fence surrounding it saying "KEEP OUT - RESTRICTED AREA". She hurries stealthily out of sight to where a hole in the fence has been mended quickly with barbed wire. She sets to work, cutting them loose with her wire cutters, all the while looking around nervously. 
 INT. STOREROOM 
 Rose shuffles around in the wheel chair, bored. The radio still plays "Moonlight Serenade". The buzzing of the sonic screwdriver in the background. Rose spins the wheel chair around in the Doctor's direction. 
 ROSE : What you doing? 
 THE DOCTOR   (holding the sonic screwdriver up against the wall near the window):  Trying to set up a resonation pattern in the concrete. Loosen the bars. 
 ROSE : You don't think he's coming back, do ya? 
 THE DOCTOR : Wouldn't bet my life. 
 ROSE : Why don't you trust him? 
 THE DOCTOR : Why do you? 
 ROSE : Saved my life. Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing. 
 The Doctor does not answer. Rose looks at him for a moment. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I trust him 'cos he's like you. Except with dating and dancing. 
 The Doctor shoots her a look. 
 ROSE : What? 
 THE DOCTOR : You just assume I'm... 
 ROSE : What? 
 THE DOCTOR   (vulnerable):  You just assume that I don't... dance. 
 ROSE   (grinning):  What, are you telling me you do ...  dance? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nine hundred years old, me. I've been around a bit. I think you can assume that at some point I've danced. 
 Rose grins even more. 
 ROSE : You?! 
 THE DOCTOR : Problem? 
 ROSE : Doesn't the universe implode or something if you... dance? 
 THE DOCTOR   (off-handed):  Well, I've got the moves but I wouldn't want to boast. 
 Rose, still grinning, stops shuffling around in her wheel chair and gets up to turn the music up. The Doctor looks around, completely wrong-footed. Rose walks slowly forward, flirtatiously. He looks determinedly back to the wall. Rose holds her hand out to him. 
 ROSE : You've got the moves? 
 The Doctor looks back at her. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Show me your moves. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose, I'm trying to resonate concrete. 
 ROSE   (not lowering his hand):  Jack'll be back, he'll get us out. So come on, the world doesn't end 'cos the Doctor dances. 
 The Doctor snaps off his sonic screwdriver, replaces it in his jacket pocket and steps away from the window towards her, an odd expression on his face. He stands in front of Rose for a moment. Where is this going to go? He takes her hands, Rose staring up at him almost apprehensively. He turns her hands over and looks at them. 
 THE DOCTOR : Barrage balloon? 
 ROSE   (completely lost)  ... What? 
 THE DOCTOR   (turning her hands over):  You were hanging from a barrage balloon. 
 ROSE   (remembering):  Oh... yeah. About two minutes after you left me. Thousands of feet above London, middle of a German air-raid, Union Jack all over my chest. 
 The Doctor raises his eyebrows. 
 THE DOCTOR : I've travelled with a lot of people, but you're setting new records for jeopardy-friendly. 
 He goes back to examining her hands. 
 ROSE : Is this you dancing? 'Cos I've got notes. 
 THE DOCTOR : Hanging from a rope a thousand feet above London. Not a cut, not a bruise. 
 He shows her her own hands. 
 ROSE : Yeah, I know. Captain Jack fixed me up... 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh, we're calling him Captain Jack now, are we? 
 ROSE : Well, his name's Jack and he's a captain... 
 THE DOCTOR   (smiling in a self-satisfied sort of way):  He's not really a captain, Rose. 
 ROSE : D'you know what I think? I think you're experiencing Captain envy. 
 The Doctor half nods, not denying this. He takes her hands and they begin to dance. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : You'll find your feet at the end of your legs. You may care to move them. 
 THE DOCTOR   (now in rather intimate proximity) : If ever he was a captain, he's been defrocked. 
 ROSE   (smiling) : Yeah? Shame I missed that. 
 JACK : Actually, I quit. Nobody takes my frock. 
 INT. JACK'S SHIP 
 They look up in surprise, and somehow, they are standing in Jack's ship. They look around at their surroundings, now standing apart. 
 JACK : Most people notice when they've been teleported. You guys are so sweet. Sorry about the delay. I had to take the nav-com offline to override the teleport security. 
 THE DOCTOR : You can spend ten minutes overriding your own protocols? Maybe you should remember whose ship it is. 
 JACK : Oh, I do. She was  gorgeous. 
 Rose smiles. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Like I told her, be back in five minutes. 
 He ducks into a compartment underneath the console. 
 THE DOCTOR   (looking around):  This is a Chula ship. 
 JACK   (calling up):  Yeah, just like that medical transporter. Only, this one is dangerous. 
 The Doctor snaps his fingers, and his hand is instantly surrounded by nanogenes. 
 ROSE : They're what fixed my hands up! Jack called 'em, um... 
 THE DOCTOR : Nanobots? Nanogenes. 
 ROSE : Nanogenes, yeah. 
 THE DOCTOR : Sub-atomic robots. There's millions of them in here, see? Burned my hand on the console when we landed - all better now. They activate when the bulk head's sealed. Check you out for damage, fix any physical flaws. 
 Rose beams. The Doctor banishes the nanogenes with a wave of his hand and turns to Jack. 
 THE DOCTOR : Take us to the crash site. I need to see your space junk. 
 JACK   (as though he's being nagged) : As soon as I get the nav-com back online. 
 The Doctor looks mildly annoyed. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Make yourself comfortable. Carry on with whatever it was you were...  (Gestures the two of them)...  doing. 
 THE DOCTOR ( innocently):  We were talking about dancing! 
 JACK : It didn't look like talking. 
 ROSE : Didn't feel like dancing. 
 The Doctor looks at her, rather naively. 
 EXT. THE CRASH SITE ENCLOSURE 
 Nancy creeps onto the bomb site, making an effort not to be seen. She ducks behind a tent - but the flood lights suddenly flash on, filling the entire site with light. She is caught. 
 ALGY : Halt! Don't move! 
 The soldiers are pointing their guns at her. There is no escape route. 
 INT. JACK'S SHIP 
 Rose is sitting talking to Jack. Jack is in the pilot seat - the Doctor is sitting some way behind Rose, not taking part in the conversation. 
 ROSE : So, you used to be a Time Agent, now you're trying to con them? 
 JACK   (fiddling with the controls)  : If it makes me sound any better, it's not for the money. 
 ROSE : For what? 
 JACK : Woke up one day when I was working for them , ound they'd stolen two years of my memories. I'd like them back. 
 ROSE : They stole your memories? 
 JACK : Two years of my life. No idea what I did. 
 The Doctor watches him. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Your friend over there doesn't trust me. And for all I know... he's right not to. 
 The computer bleeps. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Okay, we're good to go. 
 The Doctor looks up. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Crash site? 
 INT. SHED 
 The door to a shed opens, and Agly enters with Nancy and another soldier. Another soldier - Jenkins, gets to his feet. 
 ALGY : As you were. Feeling any better? 
 JENKINS   (feverishly):  Just a turn, sir. 
 ALGY   (to the soldier):  Chain her up where Jenkins can keep an eye on her. 
 The soldier leads Nancy to a chair next to the table, sits her down, and starts to handcuff her to the table. 
 NANCY : No. Not in here. Not with him. 
 There is a scar on the back of Jenkins' hand. 
 ALGY : You shouldn't have broken in here if you didn't want to stay. 
 NANCY   (urgently):  You don't understand. Not with him. 
 ALGY : This is a restricted area, miss. 
 Jenkins looks at Nancy, clearly in discomfort. Nancy looks back, almost revolted. 
 ALGY (CONT'D) : You're going to have to stay here for a bit. We're going to have to ask you a few questions. 
 Nancy does not take her eyes off the trembling Jenkins. The soldier shows Algy Nancy's wire cutters. 
 SOLDIER : Found these, sir. 
 ALGY   (taking and examining them):  Very professional... little bit too professional. Didn't just drop in by accident then, did you? 
 NANCY : My little brother died here. I wanted to find out what killed him. 
 ALGY   (to the soldiers at the door):  Take the men, check the fence for any other breaches and search the area. She may not have come alone. 
 SOLIDER : Yes, sir. 
 They leave. Algy makes to follow them. 
 NANCY   (scared, pleading):  Please! Listen, you can't leave me here. 
 ALGY : Watch her, Jenkins. 
 JENKINS : Yes, mummy. 
 Algy has turned to the door but does a double-take. 
 ALGY : Jenkins! 
 ALGY   (rubs his sweating forehead, in severe discomfort):  Sorry, sir, I... I don't know what's the matter with me. 
 NANCY   (staring at Jenkins) : Look... lock me up, fine. But not here. Please, anywhere but here! 
 Algy, not knowing quite what to make of this strange situation, shakes his head and leaves. 
 JENKINS : You'll be alright, miss. I'm just a little... 
 Nancy shakes her handcuffs, trying to free herself. 
 JENKINS (CONT'D) : Just a little... just a little... 
 She shakes the handcuffs more persistently. He pants heavily. 
 JENKINS (CONT'D) : What's the matter with you? 
 NANCY : Please, let me go. 
 JENKINS : Why would I do that? 
 NANCY : 'Cos you've got a scar on the back of your hand. 
 JENKINS : Well, yes. But I don't see what that's got to do with anything. 
 NANCY : And you feel like you're gonna be sick, like something's forcing its way up your throat. 
 Jenkins stares at her, still heaving. Nancy speaks desperately. 
 NANCY : I know because I've seen it before. 
 JENKINS   (scared):  What's happening to me? 
 NANCY : In a minute, you won't be you anymore. You won't even remember you. And unless you let me go, it's gonna happen to me too. Please. 
 JENKINS : What're you talking about? 
 NANCY : What's your mother's name? 
 JENKINS   (clasping his throat):  Matilda. 
 NANCY : You got a wife? 
 JENKINS   (red in the face):  Yes. 
 NANCY : Wife's name? 
 He stares at her, blank. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : You got kids? 
 Nothing. He's horrified. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : What's your name? 
 He mouths "I don't know", not being able to speak anymore. 
 NANCY :  Please.  Let me go. It's too late for you, I'm sorry. But  please,  let me go. 
 She is now almost crying with panic and desperation. 
 JENKINS : What d'you meeee...:  (face contorted horrible, in a lot of pain).  M... muuummee.... 
 His jaw is forced open, as though something is about to emerge. Nancy screws up her eyes and looks away as he wails. 
 
 
 
 EXT. WASTE-GROUND/OUTSIDE THE CRASH SITE 
 The Doctor, Rose and Jack walk over the rail station near the bombsite. They peer over the barbed wire. 
 JACK : There it is.  (Spots Algy pacing up and down).  Ay, they've got Algy on duty. Must be important. 
 THE DOCTOR : We've gotta get past. 
 ROSE : The words 'distract the guard' head in my general direction. 
 JACK : I don't think that'd be such a good idea. 
 ROSE : Don't worry... I can handle it. 
 JACK : I've got to know Algy quite well since I've been in town. Trust me. You're not his type. I'll distract him.  (Walks away).  Don't wait up. 
 And off he goes. Rose and the Doctor look at each other. 
 THE DOCTOR : Relax, he's a 51st century guy. He's just a bit more flexible when it comes to dancing. 
 ROSE : How flexible? 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, by his time, you lot have spread out across half the galaxy. 
 ROSE : Meaning? 
 THE DOCTOR   (grinning) : So many species, so little time... 
 ROSE : What, that's what we do when we get out there? That's our mission? We seek new life, and... and... 
 THE DOCTOR : Dance. 
 He sniggers. Jack jumps down onto the rail track on the bomb site, where Algy is pacing. 
 JACK : Hey, tiger! How's it hanging? 
 Algy turns to Jack. He looks inquisitive. 
 ALGY : Mummy? 
 JACK : Algy, old sport, it's me. 
 ALGY : Mummy? 
 JACK   (smile fading):  It's me,  Jack. 
 ALGY : Jack?  (Cocks his head to one side, observing Jack with child-like curiosity).  Are you my... mummy? 
 And he coughs, falling to his knees. Before the very eyes of Jack, Rose and the Doctor, his face transforms into a gas mask. Jack is horror-struck. The other soldiers begin to hurry over. 
 THE DOCTOR : Stay back! 
 JACK : You men! Stay away! 
 Rose and the Doctor rush over to Jack, and Algy - who is lying on the floor, lifeless. Rose stares down at him in shock. 
 THE DOCTOR : The effect's become air-borne. Accelerating. 
 ROSE : What's keeping us safe? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nothing. 
 The air-raid siren sounds. 
 JACK   (looking up):  Ah, here they come again. 
 ROSE : All we need. Didn't you say a bomb was gonna land... Here  ? 
 Jack nods. Someone in the background is singing. 
 THE DOCTOR : Never mind about that. If the contaminants air-borne now, there's hours left. 
 JACK : For what? 
 THE DOCTOR : 'Til nothing. 'Til forever. For the entire human race. And can anyone else hear singing? 
 It's coming from the shed in which Nancy has been locked up. 
 INT. SHED 
 NANCY: "  Rock-a-by baby, on the tree tops, when the wind blows the cradle will rock... " 
 Jenkins, with a gasmask face, is fast asleep with his head on the table. 
 NANCY (CONT'D): "  When the bough breaks the cradle will fall, and down will come baby, cradle and all ". 
 The door creaks open. Nancy turns her head sharply to see the Doctor poke his head into the shed. He motions for her to continue singing. 
 NANCY (CONT'D): "  Rock-a-by baby... ".  (Draws the Doctor's attention to her handcuffs) "  ... on the tree tops, when the wind blows the cradle will rock... " 
 The Doctor approaches her, taking his sonic screwdriver out of his jacket pocket. He flicks it on and begins to unlock her handcuffs. Rose and Jack appear in the doorway. The handcuffs snap open, Nancy stands, and they all leave the shed, leaving Jenkins fast asleep. 
 INT. CRASH SITE ENCLOSURE (INSIDE THE WIRE) 
 They go back to the bomb site, and the Doctor and Jack uncover the Chula med-ship, which has a tarpaulin over it, hiding it from view. Nancy and Rose watch. 
 JACK : You see? Just an ambulance. 
 NANCY : That's an ambulance? 
 ROSE   (with a reassuring arm around Nancy):  It's hard to explain, it's... it's from another world. 
 JACK   (looking at the controls):  They've been trying to get in. 
 THE DOCTOR : Of course they have. 
 Jack begins to enter the code. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : They think they've got their hands on Hitler's latest secret weapon. What're you doing? 
 JACK : Well, the sooner you see this thing is empty, the sooner you'll see I had nothing to do with it. 
 The controls explode with sparks, and they all jump backwards. An alarm goes off. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Didn't happen last time. 
 THE DOCTOR : It hadn't crashed last time. They're the emergency protocols. 
 ROSE : Doctor, what is that? 
 A red light on the control panel flashes. 
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
 The Child is standing alone in the hospital corridor. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 
 All the gasmask people inside the hospital climb slowly from their beds. As one, they make for the exits. 
 EXT. CRASH SITE ENCLOSURE (INSIDE THE WIRE) 
 ROSE : Doctor! 
 The gates at the other side of the bomb site are shaking. 
 THE DOCTOR : Captain, secure those gates! 
 JACK : Why? 
 THE DOCTOR : Just do it! 
 Jack obeys. The Doctor turns to Nancy. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Nancy, how'd you get in here? 
 NANCY : I cut the wire. 
 THE DOCTOR : Show Rose.  (Tosses his sonic screwdriver to Rose).  Setting two thousand four hundred and twenty eight D. 
 ROSE : What?? 
 THE DOCTOR : Reattaches barbed wire. Go! 
 Jack slams a gate shut. 
 EXT. HOSPITAL 
 The gasmask people emerge from the hospital doors, marching as one, calling for mummy. 
 EXT. CRASH SITE ENCLOSURE (INSIDE THE WIRE) 
 The sonic screwdriver buzzes as Rose works on the wire, reattaching it. Nancy holds the two ends together as she fuses them. They finish one, start on another. 
 NANCY : Who are you? Who are any of you? 
 ROSE : You'd never believe me if I told ya. 
 NANCY : You just told me that was an ambulance from another world. There are people running around with gas-mask heads calling for their mummies, and the sky's full of Germans dropping bombs on me. Tell me. Do you think there's anything left I couldn't believe? 
 Rose looks at her, getting the point. 
 ROSE : We're time travellers from the future. 
 NANCY : Mad, you are. 
 ROSE : We have a time travel machine, seriously! 
 NANCY : It's not that. All right, you've got a time travel machine. I believe ya. Believe anything, me.  (Looks up at the sky).  But what future? 
 Explosions in mid-air. Planes soar around, dropping bombs. 
 ROSE   (having followed her gaze):  Nancy, this isn't the end. I know how it looks. But it's not the end of the world or anything... 
 NANCY : How can you say that?? Look at it. 
 ROSE : Listen to me. I was born in this city. I'm from here, in like, 50 years time. 
 NANCY : From here? 
 ROSE   (smiling encouragingly) : I'm a Londoner. From your future. 
 NANCY : But... but you're not... 
 ROSE : What? 
 NANCY : German. 
 ROSE : Nancy, the Germans don't come here. They don't win. 
 Nancy furrows her brow. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Don't tell anyone I told you so, but do you know what? You win. 
 NANCY : We win? 
 Rose nods, smiling. Nancy half laughs, finding this unbelievably good news. 
 ROSE : Come on! 
 They jump to their feet and head back to the Doctor and Jack. 
 EXT. CRASH SITE ENCLOSURE (INSIDE THE WIRE) 
 Jack opens the hatch of the med-ship. 
 JACK   (to the Doctor):  It's empty. Look at it. 
 Rose and Nancy join them. 
 THE DOCTOR : What do you expect in a Chula medical transporter? Bandages? Cough drops? Rose? 
 ROSE : I dunno. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes, you do. 
 He mimes summoning the nanogenes. 
 ROSE : Nanogenes! 
 THE DOCTOR   (to Jack):  It wasn't empty, Captain. There was enough nanogenes in there to rebuild a species. 
 JACK   (ashen, shaken, he gets it):  Oh, God. 
 THE DOCTOR : Getting it now, are we? When the ship crashes, the nanogenes escape. Billions upon billions of them, ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the whole world. But what they find first is a dead child, probably killed earlier that night and wearing a gasmask. 
 ROSE : And they brought him back to life? They can do that? 
 THE DOCTOR : What's life? Life's easy. A quirk of matter. Nature's way of keeping meat fresh. Nothing to a nanogene. One problem, though, these nanogenes, they're not like the ones on your ship. This lot have never seen a human being before. Don't know what a human being's supposed to look like. 
 Jack, Rose and Nancy are listening to him intently, processing this. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : All they've got to go on is one little body, and there's not a lot left. But they carry right on. They do what they're programmed to do, they patch it up. Can't tell what's gasmask and what's skull, but they do their best. Then off they fly - off they go, work to be done. 'Cos you see now they think they know what people should look like and it's time to fix all the rest. And they won't ever stop. They won't ever, ever stop. The entire Human Race is gonna be torn down and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child looking for its mother, and nothing in the world can stop it! 
 His voice has risen almost to a shout. Jack is abashed, shaken. 
 JACK   (defiantly):  I didn't know. 
 The Doctor fixes him with a cold stare for a few seconds, and then goes back to examining the med-ship, starting work with his sonic screwdriver Nancy stares into the distance, beyond the fence. The gasmask people have arrived, still calling mummy. 
 NANCY   (scared) : Rose? 
 Rose rushes to Nancy's side, following her gaze. The gasmask people stumble towards them over the rail-track. They are quite a distance away, but still too close. Rose rushes back to the med-ship, and looks again at the flashing red light on the control panel. 
 ROSE   (to the Doctor):  It's bringing the gasmask people here, isn't it? 
 THE DOCTOR : The ship thinks it's under attack. It's calling up the troops. Standard protocol. 
 ROSE : But... the gasmask people aren't troops... 
 THE DOCTOR : They are now. This is a battle-field ambulance. The nanogenes don't just fix you up, they get you ready for the front line. Equip you, programme you. 
 ROSE : That's why the Child's so strong. Why it could do that phoning thing. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes. All that weapons tech in the hands of a hysterical four year old, looking for his mummy. And now there's an army of them. 
 The gasmask people surround the fence. The four of them look around nervously. 
 JACK : Why don't they attack? 
 THE DOCTOR : Good little soldiers. Waiting for their commander. 
 JACK : The child? 
 NANCY : Jamie. 
 JACK : What? 
 NANCY   (glaring at him):  Not "the child". Jamie. 
 The Doctor looks at her. 
 ROSE : So, how long until the bomb falls? 
 JACK : Any second. 
 THE DOCTOR : What's the matter, Captain? Bit close to the volcano for you? 
 NANCY : He's just a little boy. 
 THE DOCTOR : I know. 
 NANCY   (upset) : He's just a little boy who wants his mummy. 
 THE DOCTOR : I know. There isn't a little boy born who wouldn't tear the world apart to save his mummy. And this little boy can. 
 ROSE   (loudly):  So what're we gonna  do? 
 THE DOCTOR : I don't know. 
 Rose sighs. Tears whell in Nancy's eyes. 
 NANCY : It's my fault. 
 THE DOCTOR : No. 
 NANCY : It is. It's all my fault. 
 THE DOCTOR   (gently):  How can it be your... 
 He suddenly breaks off. He spins around, looking at all the gasmask people positioned behind the fence, calling for their mummy, and then back at Nancy, who is sobbing uncontrollably. He stares at her. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nancy, what age are you? Twenty? Twenty-one? Older than you look, yes? 
 A bomb lands nearby. Rose and Jack flinch. 
 JACK : Doctor, that bomb. We've got  seconds. 
 Another lands. 
 ROSE   (to Jack) : You can teleport us out. 
 The Doctor is paying them no attention, eyes fixed on the sobbing Nancy. 
 JACK : Not you guys. The nav-com's back online. Gonna take too long to override the protocols. 
 THE DOCTOR   (eyes fixed on Nancy):  So it's volcano day. Do what you've got to do. 
 ROSE   (staring at Jack, betrayed):  Jack? 
 Jack looks at her almost apologetically. He makes his decision and teleports himself out. 
 THE DOCTOR   (to Nancy):  How old were you five years ago? Fifteen? Sixteen? Old enough to give birth, anyway. 
 Nancy, still sobbing, glances up at him and then away again, shame faced. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : He's not your brother, is he? 
 Nancy shakes her head, tearful. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : A teenage single mother in 1941. So you hid. You lied. 
 Nancy nods, tears streaming down her face. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You even lied to him. 
 The gates swing open. The Child stands at the forefront of an army of gasmask people, ready to charge. 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 THE DOCTOR : He's gonna keep asking, Nancy. He's never gonna stop. Tell him. 
 No answer. The gasmask people begin to walk forward. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Nancy... the future of the human race is in your hands. Trust me... and tell him. 
 Nancy sniffs, still tearful. The Child approaches them. 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 The Doctor gives Nancy a gentle push in the direction of the Child. 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? Are you my mummy? 
 NANCY   (whispers):  Yes.  (Stronger).  Yes. I AM your mummy. 
 She faces him. The Child walks slowly forward. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 NANCY : I'm here. 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 NANCY   (kneeling before him):  I'm here. 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 NANCY   (whispers):  Yes. 
 THE DOCTOR   (to Rose):  He doesn't understand. There's not enough of him left. 
 Nancy looks at her little boy. 
 NANCY   (tearful, sincere):  I am your mummy. I will always be your mummy. I'm so sorry. 
 And she takes him into her arms, no longer caring what will happen. The nanogenes surround them, making them glow with a golden light. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : I am so, so sorry. 
 ROSE   (to the Doctor):  What's happening? 
 Nancy, still hugging her little boy, has her eyes closed and is stroking his hair. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Doctor, it's changing her, we should... 
 THE DOCTOR   (holding an arm out to silence her):  Shh! 
 He stares intently at the two of them surrounded by the nanogenes, apprehensive and excited. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Come on, please. Come on, you clever little nanogenes, figure it out! The mother. She's the mother! There's gotta be enough information, figure it out! 
 ROSE : What's happening? 
 THE DOCTOR   (pointing):  See? Recognizing the same DNA. 
 Nancy falls away from the child to the ground, as the nanogenes disappear. The Doctor and Rose rush over, the Doctor staring down at the child, hardly daring to hope. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Oh, come on. Give me a day like this. Give me this one. 
 He reaches out to the gasmask... and removes it, revealing a perfectly ordinary, very sweet little boy underneath. Nancy stares in delighted wonder and the Doctor laughs ecstatically. He lifts the little boy into the air, swinging him around. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Ah-ha-ha! Welcome back! Twenty years 'til pop music, you're gonna love it. 
 And he hugs Jamie, laughing. 
 NANCY   (in wonder):  What happened? 
 THE DOCTOR : The nanogenes recognised the superior information, the parent DNA. They didn't change you because you changed them! Haha!  (Plonks Jamie down in front of her).  Mother knows best! 
 NANCY   (almost crying with happiness):  Jamie...! 
 A bomb lands nearby. 
 ROSE : Doctor, that bomb... 
 THE DOCTOR : Taken care of it. 
 ROSE : How? 
 THE DOCTOR   (gesturing Nancy and Jamie):  Psychology! 
 The bomb plummets towards them... and is suddenly snatched out of the air by a blue forcefield. A moment later, Jack appears hovering in the tunnel of light. He calls down to them. 
 JACK : Doctor! 
 THE DOCTOR : Good lad! 
 JACK : The bomb's already commenced detonation. I've put it in stasis but it won't last long. 
 THE DOCTOR : Change of plan, don't need the bomb. Can you get rid of it? Safely as you can? 
 JACK : Rose? 
 ROSE : Yeah? 
 JACK : Goodbye. 
 And he disappears. Rose looks slightly let down, and then he reappears. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : By the way, love the tee-shirt. 
 He grins. Rose returns the grin, pulling the tee-shirt down embarrassedly. Jack disappears again. His ship zooms off into the night sky. The Doctor walks a few paces away, staring intently at his hands. He summons the nanogenes. They flutter around his hands. 
 ROSE : What're you doing? 
 THE DOCTOR : Software patch. Gonna email the upgrade. You want moves, Rose? I'll give you moves. 
 And he throws the nanogenes away from him, towards the gasmask people who are still milling around on the train track. The Doctor gives his widest grin as the gasmask people fall to the floor, the nanogenes surrounding them. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (ecstatic)  : Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once. Everybody lives! 
 And the gasmask people get to their feet, except they are no longer gasmask people. They are restored to normal human beings. The Doctor bounds over to Doctor Constantine. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Doctor Constantine. Who never left his patients. Back on your feet, constant doctor! World doesn't wanna get by without you just yet, and I don't blame it one bit.  (Gestures the former gasmask people milling around).  These are your patients. All better, now! 
 DR CONSTANTINE   (completely confused):  Yes, yes... so it seems. They also seem to be standing around in a disused railway station. Is there any particular reason for that? 
 THE DOCTOR   (beaming):  Yeah, well, you know, cutbacks. Listen, whatever was wrong with them in the past, you're probably gonna find that they're cured. Just tell them what a great doctor you are. Don't make a big thing of it. Okay? 
 And he rushes back to Rose. An old lady, Mrs Harcourt, hobbles towards Constantine. 
 MRS HARCOURT : Doctor Constantine. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Mrs Harcourt, how much better you are looking! 
 MRS HARCOURT   (bewildered):  My leg's grown back! When I come to the hospital, I had one leg. 
 DR CONSTANTINE   (observing this):  Well, there is a war on. Is it possible you miscounted? 
 THE DOCTOR   (calling over them from on top of the Chula med-ship):  Right, you lot! Lots to do! Beat the Germans, save the world, don't forget the Welfare State! 
 Constantine smiles. He and his patients begin to walk away, and the Doctor bends down to the control. He speaks to Rose. 
 THE DOCTOR : Setting this to self-destruct, soon as everybody's clear. History says there was an explosion here. Who am I to argue with history? 
 ROSE : Usually the first in line. 
 The Doctor looks at her and grins. She grins back. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor and Rose enter the TARDIS, the Doctor still chatting away happily. 
 THE DOCTOR : The nanogenes will clean up the mess and switch themselves off, because I just told them to. Nancy and Jamie will go to Doctor Constantine for help, ditto - all in all, all things considered, fantastic! 
 Rose smiles at his enthusiasm. 
 ROSE : Look at you, beaming away like you're Father Christmas! 
 THE DOCTOR : Who says I'm not, red-bicycle-when-you-were-twelve? 
 ROSE   (startled) : What?! 
 THE DOCTOR   (arms wide to embrace this) : And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives!  (Pings a switch on the console).  I need more days like this. 
 ROSE : Doctor... 
 THE DOCTOR : Go on, ask me anything. I'm on fire! 
 ROSE : What about Jack? 
 The Doctor's smile fades, and he carries on working, as though he doesn't want to answer this. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Why'd he say goodbye? 
 No answer. The Doctor stares intently at the console. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 Jack's spaceship soars through space. 
 INT. JACK'S SHIP 
 Jack clambers into the pilot seat. 
 JACK : Okay, computer, how long can we keep the bomb in stasis? 
 COMPUTER : Stasis decaying at ninety percent per cycle. Detonation in three minutes. 
 JACK : Can we jettison it? 
 COMPUTER : Any attempt to jettison the device will precipitate detonation. One hundred percent probability. 
 Jack closes his eyes for a second. 
 JACK : We could stick it in an escape pod. 
 COMPUTER : There is no escape pod on board. 
 JACK : I see the flaw in that. I'll get in the escape pod! 
 COMPUTER : There is no escape pod on board. 
 JACK   (voice rising) : Did you check everywhere? 
 COMPUTER : Affirmative. 
 JACK   (yells):  Under the sink! 
 COMPUTER : Affirmative. 
 Jack nods, beginning to acknowledge his situation. 
 JACK : Okay. Out of one hundred... exactly how dead am I? 
 COMPUTER : Termination of Captain Jack Harkness in under two minutes. One hundred percent probability. 
 Jack sighs. 
 JACK : Lovely. Thanks. Good to know the numbers. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The ship drifts along. 
 COMPUTER   (voice-over) : You're welcome. 
 JACK   (voice-over) : Okay then. 
 INT. JACK'S SHIP 
 JACK : Think we'd better initiate emergency protocol four-one-seven. 
 COMPUTER : Affirmative. 
 And a drink appears on Jack's dashboard. He reaches out to take it, smiling. He sips it. 
 JACK : Oo, a little too much vermouth. See if I come here again!  (Laughs).  Funny thing... last time I was sentenced to death, I ordered four hyper-vodkas for my breakfast. All a bit of a blur after that. Woke up in bed with both my executioners. Hmm, lovely couple. They stayed in touch!  (Ponders this).  Can't say that about most executioners.  (Laughs again).  Anyway. Thanks for everything, computer. It's been great. 
 We pull back and back. The bomb ticks away... "Moonlight Serenade" in the background... continue to pull back, right through the doors of the TARDIS. Jack spins around. Rose and the Doctor seem to be in a rather awkward position inside. 
 ROSE   (calling to Jack):  Well, hurry up then! 
 Jack leaps to his feet and dashes into the TARDIS. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose and the Doctor are waltzing around to "Moonlight Serenade". Rose is teaching the Doctor dances moves, making okaying noises as they dance. Jack looks around at the sheer size of the place, compared with the outside. 
 ROSE : Right, and turn... 
 He spins her around, getting her arm all twisted. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Okay, okay, try and spin me again, but this time, don't get my arm up my back! 
 The Doctor looks sheepish. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : No extra points for a half-nelson. 
 THE DOCTOR   (rather put out):  I'm sure I used to know this stuff.  (To Jack):  Close the door, will you. Your ship's about to blow up, there's gonna be a draft. 
 Rose grins and leans against one of the pillars. The Doctor flicks a switch and the engines start up. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Welcome to the TARDIS. 
 JACK : Much bigger on the inside... 
 THE DOCTOR : You'd better be. 
 ROSE : I think what the Doctor's trying to say is... you may cut in. 
 They grin and she takes his hand, as if to dance with him. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose! I've just remembered! 
 ROSE : What? 
 And "In The Mood" blares out of the speakers, wherever they are. Lights flash all around the room, and the Doctor moves towards Rose in time to the music, clicking his fingers. 
 THE DOCTOR : I can dance! 
 ROSE : Actually, Doctor... I thought Jack might like this dance. 
 THE DOCTOR   (unfazed):  I'm sure he would, Rose. I'm absolutely certain. But who with? 
 Rose sniggers and hops up the steps to take the Doctor's hands. It's almost as though he was only pretending he couldn't dance before. He spins her perfectly. Jack watches them with a big smile on his face as they dance around the console room, perfect partners. The Doctor suddenly throws her backwards over his arm, earning a whoop of delight from Rose. Jack averts his eyes, still smiling. Rose pulls herself up, and sags onto his shoulder, giggling.
