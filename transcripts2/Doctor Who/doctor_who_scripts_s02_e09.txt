 A recap of 208 "The Impossible Planet". 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 The Ood advance towards Jefferson, Rose and the other crew member. 
 JEFFERSON : Open fire! 
 He and the guard fire at the Ood, whilst Rose cowers. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 The shaking lessens slightly in the control room. 
 ZACH : We're stabilising... 
 The overhead shutters slide closed. 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : We've got orbit. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Rose steps over to the dead bodies of the Ood and grabs the communication device once more, impatient to see if the Doctor is okay. 
 ROSE : Doctor? 
 Static, no reply. 
 ROSE : Doctor, can you hear me? Doctor? Ida? Are you there? 
 COMPUTER :  l Open Door 25. 
 Jefferson and the guard spin round, guns raised and ready for whatever will come through the door, but it's only Danny. 
 DANNY : It's me! But they're coming. 
 COMPUTER : Close Door 25. 
 DANNY : It's the Ood. They've gone mad. 
 JEFFERSON : How many of them? 
 DANNY : All of them! All fifty! 
 JEFFERSON   (approaching the door) : Danny, out of the way.  (Danny doesn't move, so with more ferocity...):  Out of the way! 
 He pushes Danny out of the way of the door. 
 DANNY : But they're armed! They're da... 
 Jefferson starts to open the door. 
 DANNY : It's the interface device. I don't know how, but they're using it as a weapon. 
 COMPUTER : Open door 25. 
 Jefferson opens the door, the Ood are standing on the other side. One of them immediately advances, sticking the communication orb to the guard's forehead. She screams and slumps to the floor, dead. Jefferson open fires. 
 INT. CORRIDOR 
 Zach closes the door from the control room. 
 COMPUTER : Close Door 1. 
 He starts to run down the corridor, but skids to a halt as he sees the Ood advancing from the other end. He goes back the way he came. 
 COMPUTER (CONT'D) : Open Door 1. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 Zach closes the door behind him. 
 COMPUTER (CONT'D) : Close Door 1. 
 Zach presses buttons on a control panel mounted on the wall. 
 ZACH : Lockdown, seal Door 1. 
 COMPUTER : Lockdown Door 1. 
 Zach goes back to the controls in the centre of the room, a babble of frantic voices sounding from communication. 
 ZACH : Jefferson, what's happening, there? 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 JEFFERSON   (into wrist device):  I've got very little ammunition, sir. How about you? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 Zach quickly checks. He opens a cupboard and inside is a gun. He removes it. 
 ZACH : All I've got is a bolt gun. With uh...  (Check)  all of one bolt. I could take out a grand total of one Ood. Fat lot of good that is. 
 JEFFERSON : Given the emergency... 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 JEFFERSON (CONT'D) : I recommend Strategy Nine. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH   (defeated):  Strategy Nine agreed. Right, we need to get everyone together. Rose? What about Ida and the Doctor? Any word? 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Rose shakes her head. She's out of her mind with worry. Her voice is shaking slightly. 
 ROSE : I can't get any reply, just... nothing, I keep trying, but it's... 
 Just then, the communication device crackles and the Doctor's voice comes through. 
 THE DOCTOR : No! Sorry, I'm fine. Still here! 
 ROSE   (so relieved):  You could've said, you stupid b... 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 The communication device screeches loudly, blanking the rest of the word out. The Doctor winces. 
 THE DOCTOR : Whoa! Careful! Anyway, it's both of us, me and Ida. Hello! But the seal opened up. It's gone. All we've got left is this chasm. 
 As the Doctor says, the trapdoor has opened onto a gaping pitch black hole. 
 ZACH : How deep is it? 
 THE DOCTOR : Can't tell. It looks like it goes on forever. 
 ROSE : "The pit is open." 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : That's what the voice said. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : But there's nothing? I mean... 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : There's... nothing coming out? 
 THE DOCTOR : No, no. No sign of "the Beast". 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE   (scared) : It said "Satan". 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 THE DOCTOR : Come on, Rose. Keep it together. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE : Is there no such thing?  (No reply).  Doctor? 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 The Doctor, still not answering, turns his back on the pit. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Doctor, tell me there's no such thing. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Ida? I recommend that you withdraw. Immediately. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA : But... we've come all this way! 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Okay, that was an order. With-Draw .  With that thing open, the whole planet's shifted. One more inch and we fall into the black hole. So this thing stops right now. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA : But it's not much better up there with the Ood. 
 ZACH : I'm initiating Strategy Nine, so I need the two of you back up top immediately, no ar... 
 Ida turns off her wrist device. The Doctor raises his eyebrows. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH (CONT'D)   (upon hearing the static):  Ida? IDA? 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA   (to the Doctor):  What do you think? 
 THE DOCTOR : I think they've an order. 
 IDA : Yeah, but... what do you think? 
 The Doctor puts one foot on the edge of the pit, staring down into it. 
 THE DOCTOR : It said "I am the temptation". 
 IDA : If... if there's something in there... why's it still hiding? 
 THE DOCTOR : Maybe... we opened the prison but not the cell. 
 IDA : We should go down. I'd go. What about you? 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh! Oh, in a second, but then again...  (He gives a half laugh, turns to her).  That is so human. Where angels fear to tread. Even now, standing on the edge. It's that feeling you get. Yeah?  (Looks into the pit as though mesmerised, musing).  Right at the back of your head. That impulse... that strange little impulse... that mad little voice saying "Go on... go on... go on... go over, go on...", maybe it's relying on that. For once in my life... Officer Scott... I'm going to say... 
 He looks at her. She looks at him... hold the moment, before... 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Retreat.  (He sighs and pulls his foot back from where it was rested on the edge of the pit).   Now I know I'm getting old.  (Opens communications).  Rose, we're coming back. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE   (smiling, pleased):  Best news I've heard all day! 
 Jefferson released the safety catch on his gun. He's looking down at Toby. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : What're you doing? 
 JEFFERSON   (aiming the gun at Toby):  He's infected. He brought that thing on board. You saw it. 
 Toby's eyes widen in shock. He's cornered, cowering on the floor. 
 ROSE   (approaching him):  Are you gonna start shooting your own people, now? Is that what you're gonna do? Is it? 
 JEFFERSON : If necessary. 
 ROSE : Well then, you'll have to shoot me "if necessary", so what's it gonna be? 
 Jefferson pauses. Rose kneels next to Toby. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Look at his face. Whatever it was, it's gone. It passed into the Ood. You saw it happen. He's clean. 
 Jefferson considers. Toby is breathing heavily, frightened. 
 JEFFERSON : Any sign of trouble... I'll shoot him. 
 He moves away. 
 ROSE   (to Toby):  Are you all right? 
 TOBY   (trembling, close to tears):  Yeah... I...  (Shakes head).  Dunno. 
 ROSE : Can you remember anything? 
 TOBY : Just... it was so angry. It was... fury and rage... death... 
 From casting terrified glances around the room, he meets Rose's eyes. 
 TOBY (CONT'D) : It was him. It was the devil. 
 ROSE : Come here. 
 She draws Toby into a comforting hug. He clings to her, eyes still wide open with horror over her shoulder. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 The Doctor and Ida are trudging back to the capsule. 
 THE DOCTOR : What's Strategy Nine? 
 IDA : Open the airlocks... we'll be safe inside the lockdown... the Ood will get thrown out into the 
 vacuum. 
 THE DOCTOR : So we're going back to a slaughter? 
 They have reached the capsule. Ida turns to him. 
 IDA : The devil's work. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Jefferson, Danny and Rose are waiting for them to make contact. 
 IDA : Okay, we're in. Bring us up. 
 JEFFERSON : Ascension in... 
 Rose smiles with anticipation. 
 JEFFERSON (CONT'D) : Three... two... one. 
 The mechanism fails. The lights go out. 
 INT. CAPSULE 
 The lights fail. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 The lights blink out. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : This is the Darkness. This is my domain. 
 The display on the screen changes to that of several of the Ood standing together, the Beast is using them to communicate. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST (CONT'D) : You little things that live in the light... clinging to your feeble Suns... 
 Zach picks up his bolt gun. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST (CONT'D) : ... which die in the... 
 ZACH   (through communication):  That's not the Ood. Something's talking through them. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : Only the Darkness remains. 
 ZACH : This is Captain Zachary Cross Flane of Sanctury Base Six representing the Torchwood archive. You will identify yourself. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : You know my name. 
 ZACH : What do you want? 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : You will die here. All of you. This planet is your grave. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 TOBY   (trembling):  It's him. It's him. It's him... 
 INT. CAPSULE 
 THE DOCTOR : If you are the Beast, then answer me this: which one? Hmm? 'Cos the universe has been busy since you've been gone. There's more religions than there are planets in the sky. The Archivits... Pordonity, Christianity... Pash-Pash, New Judaism... Sanclar... Church of the Tin Vagabond, which devil are you? 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : All of them. 
 THE DOCTOR : What, then you're the truth behind the myth? 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : This one knows me, as I know him. The killer of his own kind. 
 THE DOCTOR   (choosing not to acknowledge this):  How did you end up on this rock? 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : The disciples of the Light rose up against me. And chained me in the pit for all eternity. 
 THE DOCTOR : When was this? 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : Before time. 
 THE DOCTOR : What does that mean?! 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : Before time. 
 THE DOCTOR : What does "before time" mean? 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : Before light and time and space and matter. Before the cataclysm. Before this universe was created. 
 THE DOCTOR : That's impossible. No life could have existed back then. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : Is that your religion? 
 THE DOCTOR : It's a belief. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : You know nothing. All of you. So small. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 Cut to Zach. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST (CONT'D) : The Captain, so scared of command. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Cut to Jefferson. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST (CONT'D) : The soldier, haunted by the eyes of his wife. The scientist, still running from daddy. 
 Ida shifts uncomfortably in the capsule. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST (CONT'D) : The little boy who lied... 
 Cut to Danny, who is uncomfortable. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST (CONT'D) : The virgin... 
 Toby turns, on edge. Then cut to Rose. 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST (CONT'D) : And the lost girl, so far away from home. The valiant child who will die in battle so very soon. 
 ROSE : Doctor, what does it mean? 
 THE DOCTOR   (quietly):  Rose, don't listen. 
 ROSE : What does it mean? 
 THE VOICE OF THE BEAST : You will die... and I will live. 
 The footage of the Ood suddenly cuts and is replaced with a roaring horned beast, which causes everyone but the Doctor to gasp and stumble backwards. 
 DANNY   (voice shaking with fear):  What the hell was that? 
 They're all speaking over one another, frantic. 
 TOBY : I had that thing inside my head. 
 ROSE   (voice becoming higher):  Doctor, what did it mean? 
 DANNY : What do we do? Jefferson? 
 JEFFERSON   (into wrist device):  Captain? What's the situation on Strategy Nine? 
 DANNY : Zach, what do we do? 
 TOBY : What if I can fix it? ... the black hole, everything's true. 
 JEFFERSON : Captain, report. 
 ZACH : We've lost pictures... 
 ROSE : Doctor, how did it know all of... 
 IDA : Did anyone get... 
 ZACH : Jefferson? 
 THE DOCTOR : Stop... 
 ROSE : What did it mean? 
 THE DOCTOR : Everyone just stop... 
 DANNY : What do we do? 
 JEFFERSON : Report. 
 INT. CAPSULE 
 The Doctor holds the communication device close to the speaker, making it screech loudly. The babble stops and silence falls. 
 THE DOCTOR : If you want voices in the dark, then listen to mine; that thing is playing on very basic fears. Darkness, childhood nightmares, all that stuff. 
 DANNY : But that's how the devil works. 
 THE DOCTOR : Or a good psychologist. 
 IDA : But... how did it know about my father? 
 THE DOCTOR   (after a slight pause):  Okay, but what makes his version of the truth any better than mine? Hmm? Cos I'll tell you what I can see: humans. Brilliant humans. Humans who travel all the way across space. Flying in a tiny little rocket into the orbit of a black hole! Just for the sake of discovery, that's amazing! Do you hear me? Amazing. All of you. The captain, his officer, his elder, his genius, his friends. All with one advantage. The Beast is alone. We are not. If we can use that to fight against him... 
 With a loud bang, the cable for the capsule snaps. It falls down the shaft. 
 IDA   (looking up):  The cable's snapped! 
 THE DOCTOR : Get out! 
 The dive out of the capsule just as the cable lands inside it with force. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Dust wafts onto the exploration deck. 
 ROSE : Doctor! We lost the cable! Doctor, are you all right?  (No reply).  Doctor? 
 ZACH : Comms are down. 
 ROSE : Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH   (looking at the monitor):  I've still got life signs, but... we've lost the capsule. 
 ROSE : Say something, are you there? 
 ZACH : There's no way out.  (Beat).  They're stuck down there. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 The Doctor and Ida stand, brushing themselves off. 
 THE DOCTOR : How much air have we got? 
 IDA : Sixty minutes.  (Checks wrist device).  Fifty-five. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Rose, Jefferson and Danny peer down the lift shaft. 
 ROSE : But we've got to bring them back. 
 JEFFERSON : They're ten miles down. We haven't got another ten miles of cable. 
 Another loud bang on a door makes them jump. 
 JEFFERSON (CONT'D)   (into wrist device):  Captain? Situation report. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 Zach glances up. Something is banging on his door too. He goes over to it and opens the small round window. An Ood stares back at him. It has what looks like an enormous pair of pliers and is using them in order to break the door down. Zach sighs. 
 ZACH : It's the Ood. They're cutting through the door bolts. They're breaking in. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 JEFFERSON : Yeah, it's the same on Door 25. 
 ROSE : How long's it gonna take? 
 JEFFERSON : Well, it's only a basic frame, it should take ten minutes.  (another bang).  Eight. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : I've got a security frame, it might last a bit longer, but that doesn't help you. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE : Right. So we need to stop them, or get out, or both. 
 DANNY : I'll take both, yeah? But how? 
 ROSE : You heard the Doctor. Why do you think that thing cut him off? 'Cos he was making sense. He was telling you to think your way out of this. Come on! For a start, we need some lights. There's gotta be some sort of power somewhere. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH   (bitterly) : There's nothing I can do. Some captain, stuck in here, pressing buttons. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE : That's what the Doctor meant: press the right buttons. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : They've gutted the generators!  (With realisation).  But the rocket's got an independent supply. If I could reroute that... Mr Jefferson? 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ZACH : Open the bypass conduits. Override the safety... 
 JEFFERSON   (pressing the appropriate buttons):  Opening bypass conduits, sir. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Channeling rocket feed. In 3... 2... 1... power. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 The lights come back on. Rose claps. 
 ROSE : There we go. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 The lights flash on. 
 DANNY : Let there be light! 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE : What about that Strategy Nine thing? 
 JEFFERSON : Not enough power. It needs a hundred percent. 
 ROSE : All right, we need a way out. Zach, Mr Jefferson, you start working on that.  (Approaches Toby).  Toby, what about you? 
 TOBY   (standing):  I'm not a soldier. I can't do anything. 
 ROSE : No, you're the archaeologist. What do you know about the pit? 
 TOBY : Well, n-n-nothing. We can't even translate the language. 
 ROSE   (turns away):  Right. 
 TOBY : H-hold on. Maybe. 
 ROSE : What is it? 
 TOBY : Since that thing was inside my head, it's like the letters made more sense. 
 ROSE : Well... get to work. Anything you can translate, just... anything.  (Approaches Danny).  As for you, Danny-boy, you're in charge of the Ood, any way of stopping them? 
 DANNY : Well... I don't know. 
 ROSE   (pulls him over to the computer):  Then find out. The sooner we get control of the base, the sooner we can get the Doctor out. Shift. 
 She smacks him playfully and then looks down the never-ending shaft. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA : We've got all this cable, we might as well use it. The drum's disconnected, we could adapt it. (Starts gathering up the fallen cable).  Feed it through. 
 THE DOCTOR : And then what? 
 IDA : Abseil. Into the pit. 
 THE DOCTOR : Abseil. Right. 
 IDA : We're running out of air with no way back. It's the only thing we can do. Even if it's the last thing we ever achieve. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'll get back. Rose is up there. 
 IDA : Well, maybe the key to that is finding out what's in the pit. 
 THE DOCTOR : Well... it's half of a good plan. 
 IDA : What's the other half? 
 THE DOCTOR : I go down. Not you. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Rose watches Jefferson as he works at the computer. 
 JEFFERSON : Open junctions five... six... seven...  (A bang on the door)  ... reroute filters sixteen to twenty-four. Go. 
 Toby is working on the symbols. 
 DANNY   (also working) : There's all sorts of viruses that could stop the Ood. Trouble is, we haven't got them on board. 
 ROSE   (sarcastically) : Well, that's handy, listing all the things we haven't got. We haven't got a swimming pool either. Or a Tescos. 
 The computer bleeps. The word "affirmative" flashes on the screen. 
 DANNY   (excited) : Oh my God. It says yes! I can do it! Hypothetically, if you flip the monitor, broadcast a flare... it can disrupt the telepathy! Brainstorm! 
 ROSE : What happens to the Ood? 
 DANNY : It'll tank them, spark out! 
 ROSE   (enthusiastically):  There we are, then! Do it! 
 DANNY   (face falls):  No, but...  (Shakes head).  I'd have to transmit from the central monitor. We need to go to Ood Habitation. 
 Another bang on the door, causing sparks to fly. 
 ROSE   (staring at the door):  That's what we'll do, then.  (She goes to Mr Jefferson).  Mr Jefferson, sir! Any way out? 
 JEFFERSON : Just about... there's a network of maintenance tunnels running underneath the base. We should be able to gain access from here. 
 ROSE   (smiling):  Ventilation shafts. 
 JEFFERSON : Yeah, I appreciate the reference, but there's no ventilation. No air, in fact, at all. They were designed for machines, not life forms. 
 Another bang. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : But, I can manipulate the oxygen field from here. Create discrete pockets of atmosphere... if I control it manually... I can follow you through the network. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE : Right, so we go down, and you make the air follow us. By hand. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : You wanted me pressing buttons. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ROSE : Yeah, I asked for it, okay, we need to get to Ood Habitation, work out a route. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 The Doctor and Ida are securing the cable so they can abseil down the pit. 
 IDA : That should hold it. How's it going? 
 The cable unravels. 
 THE DOCTOR : Fine! Should work... doesn't feel like such a good idea, now.  (Stands on the edge of the pit).  Ha... there it is again. That itch.  (He bobs up and down crazily).  Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down. 
 IDA : The urge to jump. Do you know where it comes from, that sensation? Genetic heritage. Ever since we were primates in the trees. It's our body's way of testing us. Calculating whether or not we can reach the next branch. 
 THE DOCTOR   (thoughtfully):  No, that's not it... that's too kind. It's not the urge to jump, it's deeper than that. It's the urge to fall! 
 And he jumps backwards down the hole. 
 IDA : Doctor! 
 She presses a button, the cable becomes taut. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE / THE PIT 
 The Doctor stops falling. He is now hanging by the cable a short way into the pit. 
 IDA : Are you okay? 
 THE DOCTOR : Not bad, thanks. The wall of the pit... seems to be the same as the cavern, just... (Shines torch down).  Not much of it. There's a crust about twenty feet down and then... nothing. Just the pit. Okay, then. Lower me down. 
 IDA : Well, here we go, then. 
 She presses the button again. The Doctor is lowered slowly down the pit. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Another violent bang on Door 25. Rose, Jefferson and Toby are ready to enter the maintenance tunnels, but Danny is still at the computer. 
 ROSE   (shouting to him):  Danny! 
 DANNY : Hold on! Just conforming... 
 JEFFERSON : Dan, you gotta go now!  (Another bang).  Come on! 
 The computer bleeps. 
 DANNY : Yeah! 
 He takes what looks like an orange computer chip from the machine. He shows them as he hurries over to the entrance to the maintenance tunnels. 
 DANNY (CONT'D) : Put that in the monitor... and it's a bad time to be an Ood! 
 ROSE : We're coming back. Have you got that? We're coming back to this room and we're getting the Doctor out. 
 JEFFERSON : Okay, Danny, you go first, then you Miss Tyler, then Toby, I'll go last in defence of position. Now come on! Quick as you can! 
 They all lower themselves down into the tunnels in the order Jefferson specified. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 Rose lands in the tunnel next to Danny. She sniffs. 
 ROSE : God, it stinks. You all right? 
 DANNY : Yeah, I'm laughing. 
 Toby lands beside them. 
 DANNY (CONT'D)   (through comm, to Zach) : Which way do we go? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Just go straight ahead. Keep going 'til I say so. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Jefferson makes it down the hole just in time, the Ood finally break the door down. They advance. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 Danny, Rose, Toby and Jefferson crawl down the tunnel. 
 ROSE   (staring at Danny's bum):  Not your best angle, Danny. 
 DANNY : Oi! Stop it! 
 TOBY   (considering Rose's bum):  I dunno, it could be worse. 
 ROSE   (indignantly):  Oi! 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Straight along until you find junction 7.1. Keep breathing. I'm feeding you air. I've got you. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 Exterior shot of the base. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 They reach a junction in the tunnels and sit down, out of breath. 
 DANNY   (into wrist device):  We're at 7.1, sir. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Okay, I've got you... 
 He presses more buttons. A bang on the door makes him jump. 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : I'm just aerating the next section. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 DANNY : Getting kinda cramped, sir... can't you hurry up? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : I'm working on half power, here. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 JEFFERSON : Stop complaining. 
 ROSE   (to Danny):  Mr Jefferson says: stop complaining. 
 DANNY : I heard. 
 ROSE   (to Jefferson):  He heard. 
 TOBY   (into wrist device):  But the air's getting a bit thin. 
 ROSE : He's complaining now. 
 JEFFERSON : I heard. 
 Danny wipes the sweat of his face. Rose sniffs, her face screwed up in disgust. 
 ROSE : Danny, is that you? 
 DANNY   (defensively)  :  I'm not exactly happy. 
 ZACH : I'm just moving the air... 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : I've got to oxygenate the next section. Now, keep calm... or it's gonna feel worse. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 There is a loud banging from the other end of the tunnel. Jefferson aims his gun. 
 DANNY : What was that? 
 ROSE   (loudly):  Mr Jefferson, what was that? 
 TOBY : What's that noise? 
 JEFFERSON : Captain... what was that? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH   (looking at the hologram):  The junction in Habitation Five's been opened, it must be the Ood. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 The Ood crawl down the tunnels with frightening speed. 
 ZACH   (warningly):  They're in the tunnels! 
 DANNY : Well, open the gate! 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : I've gotta get the air in! 
 DANNY : Just open it! ... sir. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 ROSE : Where are they? Are they close? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Don't know, I can't tell - I can't  see  them... the computer doesn't register Ood as proper life forms. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 ROSE : Whose idea was that? 
 DANNY   (practically roars into the wrist device, sweating and shaking):  Open the gate! 
 The gate opens and they lunge through it. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Danny, turn left. Immediate left. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 They crawl down the tunnel as fast as they can, Jefferson going backwards with his gun at the ready. 
 JEFFERSON : The Ood, sir, can't you trap them? Cut off the air? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Not without cutting off yours. 
 Another bang on his door. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 The Ood pursue them down the tunnel, but they're still not in sight. 
 ZACH : Danny, turn right. Go right! Go fast, Dan, they're gonna catch up! 
 Danny does as he says, frantic. 
 JEFFERSON : I'll maintain defence of position! 
 ROSE : You can't stop! 
 JEFFERSON   (sitting down, aiming his gun):  Miss Tyler, that's my job. You've got your task, now see to it. 
 TOBY   (to Rose):  You heard what he said, now shift. 
 They move on, leaving Jefferson. An Ood appears from round the corridor and crawls towards Jefferson. He fires his gun. The others can hear the shots as they crawl as fast as possible. Jefferson turns, shoots more oncoming Ood. Toby and the others reach the next juction. 
 DANNY   (into wrist device):  8.2. Open 8.2. Zach! 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH   (pressing buttons):  I've gotta aerate it! 
 DANNY   (furiously):  Open it now! 
 ZACH : I'm trying. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 Danny thumps on the gate, desperate. 
 ROSE   (stopping him):  Danny, stop it. That's not helping. 
 TOBY : Zach, get it open! 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Jefferson... I've gotta open 8.2 by closing 8.1. You've got to get past the junction, now move .  That's an order, now move! 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 Jefferson shoots at an Ood from around a corner, he runs out of bullets. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH   (angrily):  I'm gonna lose oxygen, Jefferson, I can't stop for your dramatics! 
 He watches the hologram, showing Jefferson move towards the rest of the group. 
 
 
 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 Gate 8.2 opens, allowing Danny, Rose and Toby through it. 
 DANNY   (crawling through) : Come on! 
 Rose glances back down the corridor before following. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Danny, turn left and head for 9.2. That's the last one. Jefferson... 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 Jefferson is crawling along the corridor, trying to reach the gate before it closes. 
 ZACH : You've gotta move faster. Move! 
 ROSE : Mr Jefferson, come on...! 
 TOBY   (pushing her forward):  Keep going! 
 It's too late, the gate closes, leaving Jefferson trapped on the wrong side. He slumps against it, panting. 
 JEFFERSON : Regret to inform, sir... I was a bit slow. Not so fast, these days. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : I can't open 8.1, John. Not without losing air for the others. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 JEFFERSON : And quite right too, sir. I think I bought them a little time. 
 The others reach the end of the tunnel. 
 ZACH : There's nothing I can do, Jefferson. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH   (quietly):  I'm sorry. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 JEFFERSON : You've done enough, sir. Made a very good captain under the circumstances. 
 Danny and Rose are both close to tears. 
 JEFFERSON : I ask, if you can't add oxygen to this section... can you speed up the process of its removal? 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : I don't understand. What do you mean? 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 JEFFERSON   (staring down the tunnel):  Well... if I might chose the manner of my departure, sir... lack of air seems more natural than... well... let's say... death by Ood. 
 For an Ood is crawling towards him. 
 JEFFERSON (CONT'D)   (voice rising):  I'd appreciate it, sir! 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : God speed, Mr Jefferson. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 JEFFERSON : Thank you, sir. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 Zach presses the appropriate buttons and cuts off the air. He closes his eyes. The light representing Jefferson on the screen goes out. 
 ZACH   (close to tears but fighting them):  Report... Officer John Maynard Jefferson PKD... deceased... with honours. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 Danny, Rose and Toby sit in silence. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : 43K2.1. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 DANNY : Zach... we're at the final junction. 9.2. And er... if my respects could be on record. He saved our lives. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : Noted. Opening 9.2. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 The gate opens. The Ood are right behind it, waiting for them. Rose, Danny and Toby scramble away, shocked. 
 ROSE : Lower 9.2. Zach, lower it! 
 DANNY : Back! Back! Back! 
 TOBY : We can't go back! The gang point's sealed off, we're stuck! 
 Rose looks up and notices grilling above her head. 
 ROSE : Come on! 
 She pushes it out of the way. 
 INT. CORRIDOR 
 She emerges through the floor of the corridor above. Danny follows. 
 INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNELS 
 The Ood crawl towards Toby. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (calling down to Toby):  Come on! Toby, come on! 
 Toby looks at the Ood and places a finger to his lips. His eyes are glowing red once more. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Toby, get out of there! 
 TOBY   (scrambling up, eyes back to normal):  Help me! Oh, my God, help me! 
 INT. CORRIDOR 
 Rose and Toby hoist him up through the hole. More Ood approach from one end of the corridor. 
 DANNY   (running in the opposite direction):  It's this way. 
 They follow Danny along the corridor, the Ood in pursuit. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 There is another bang on the door of the control room. Zach picks up his bolt gun. 
 ZACH : Hurry up! 
 INT. OOD HABITATION 
 Danny, Rose and Toby burst through the doors into Ood Habitation, and rush over the computer. The Ood already inside look up at their arrival. 
 ROSE : Get it in! 
 TOBY : Danny, get down. 
 ROSE : Transmit! 
 DANNY : I'm trying, I'm trying! I'm getting at it... 
 TOBY : Stop them! 
 The Ood are making their way up the stairs towards them. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 With a final bang, the Ood manage to open the door to the control room. Zach stands and points his gun at them. 
 INT. OOD HABITATION 
 ROSE : Danny, get that thing transmitting! 
 Danny bungs it into the computer. The reading goes down to Basic 0. The Ood clutch at their heads and stumble about, all over the ship. They finally collapse to the floor. Silence falls. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (smiling):  You did it! We did it! 
 DANNY : Yes! 
 She laughs in delight, as does Danny, and throws her arms around him, then hugs Toby, who grins. Danny and Toby hug. 
 ROSE   (into comm):  Zach, we did it. The Ood are down. Now we've gotta get the Doctor. 
 INT. CONTROL ROOM 
 ZACH : I'm on my way. 
 INT. OOD HABITATION 
 Rose rushes from Ood Habitation. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE / THE PIT 
 The Doctor is still being lowered down the pit, in complete darkness. 
 THE DOCTOR : You get representations of the Horned Beast right across the universe. In the myths and legends of a million worlds. Earth... Draconia, Velconsadine... Daemos... the Kaled God of War... it's the same image, over and over again. Maybe... that idea came from somewhere. Bleeding through... the thought at the back of every sentient mind. 
 IDA : Emanating from here? 
 THE DOCTOR : Could be. 
 IDA : But if this is the original... does that make it real? Does that make it the actual devil, though? 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, if that's what you want to believe. Maybe that's what the devil is, in the end. An idea. 
 The cable runs out and the Doctor jerks to a halt. 
 IDA : That's it. That's all we've got. 
 The Doctor presses buttons on the device on his wrist. 
 IDA (CONT'D) : You getting any sort of readout? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nothing. Could be miles to go, yet. Or... could be thirty feet. No way of telling. (He thinks about this).  I could survive thirty feet. 
 IDA : Oh no you don't. I'm pulling you back up. 
 She presses the button to hoist him back up. But the Doctor presses a button on his own end, stopping her. 
 IDA   (striding to the edge):  What're you doing?! 
 THE DOCTOR : You bring me back, then we're just gonna sit there and run out of air. I've gotta go down. 
 IDA   (scared):  But you can't. Doctor, you can't. 
 THE DOCTOR : Call it an act of faith. 
 He releases one the hooks securing him to the cable. 
 IDA : But... I don't want to die on my own. 
 THE DOCTOR : I know. 
 He releases another hook. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Rose and the others have reached the exploration deck. Without a moments hesitation, Rose picks up the comm. 
 ROSE : Doctor? Are you there? Doctor? Ida? Can you hear me? 
 ZACH : The comms are still down. I can patch them through the central desk and boost the signal. Just give me a minute. 
 He starts to work at the computer. Rose looks on, anxious, eyes wide. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE / THE PIT 
 The Doctor releases another hook. 
 THE DOCTOR : I didn't ask: have you got any sort of faith, or...? 
 IDA   (sitting on the edge of the pit):  Not really. I was brought up Neo Classic, congregational... because of my mum, she was...  (She pauses, reminiscing).  My old mum. But no, I never believed. 
 THE DOCTOR : Neo Classic, have they got a devil? 
 IDA : No, not as such. Just um... the things that men do. 
 THE DOCTOR : Same thing in the end. 
 IDA : What about you? 
 The Doctor pauses for a long moment, thinking. 
 THE DOCTOR : I believe... I believe I haven't seen everything, I don't know... it's funny, isn't it? The things you make up, the rules. If that thing had said it came from beyond the universe, I'd believe it, but before the universe... impossible. Doesn't fit my rule. Still, that's why I keep travelling. To be proved wrong. Thank you, Ida. 
 IDA   (suddenly standing):  Don't go! 
 THE DOCTOR : If they get back in touch... if you talk to Rose... just tell her... 
 He pauses for a moment, looking down. Ida waits. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Tell her I...  (Another pause. Then, to himself).  Oh, she knows. 
 He releases the final hook and falls into nothingness. 
 ROSE   (through comm.):  Doctor? Are you there? Doctor, Ida? Can you hear me? 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Are you there, Doctor? 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA : He's gone. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE : What do you mean, "he's gone"? 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA : He fell. Into the pit. And I don't know how deep it is, miles and miles and miles. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ROSE   (voice breaking):  But... what do you mean "he fell"? 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA   (quietly):  I couldn't stop him. He said your name... 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 Zach gently tugs the comm. away from Rose. She's silent, staring straight ahead. 
 ZACH : I'm sorry. 
 Rose does not respond. He speaks into the comm. 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : Ida? There's no way of reaching you. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 Ida listens to this, alone on the edge of the pit. 
 ZACH : No cable, no back-up... you're ten miles down... 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : We can't get there. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA   (looking around):  You should see this place, Zach.  (Sits down on the edge of the pit).  It's beautiful. Well, I wanted to discover things...  (She tears up).  And here I am. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ZACH : We've got to abandon the base. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 Ida bites her lip as she listens. 
 ZACH : I'm declaring this mission unsafe. All we can do is make sure no one ever comes here again. 
 IDA : But we'll never find out what it was? 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ZACH : Well, maybe that's best. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 IDA : Yeah. 
 There is a pause. 
 ZACH : Officer Scott... 
 IDA : It's all right. Just go. Good luck. 
 INT. EXPLORATION DECK 
 ZACH : Thank you.  (Replace the comm.).  Danny, Toby, close down the feed links. Get the retrotopes online. Then get to the rocket, strap yourselves in. We're leaving. 
 Rose turns to him. 
 ROSE : I'm not going. 
 ZACH   (reassuringly):  Rose, there's space for you. 
 ROSE   (quietly) : No, I'm gonna wait for the Doctor. Just like he waited for me. 
 ZACH   (gently):  I'm sorry, but... he's dead. 
 ROSE : You don't know him. 'Cos he's not...  (Her voice breaks up with repressed tears).  I'm telling you, he's... he's not... and even if he was, how could I leave him? All on his own, all the way down there? No. I'm gonna stay. 
 Zach nods. 
 ZACH : Then I apologise for this. Danny, Toby, make her secure. 
 Danny and Toby come up on either side of Rose, taking an arm each. 
 ROSE   (struggling):  No, no! No! No! No! Let me go!  (Straining, screaming at them).  Get off me! I'm not leaving! 
 Zach plunges a needle into her arm, sedating her. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (as she goes limp):  No... 
 ZACH   (determinedly) : I have lost too many people. I am not leaving you behind.  (Hoists her over his shoulder).  Let's get her on board. 
 INT. CORRIDOR 
 They emerge into a corridor, which is littered with the Ood. 
 TOBY   (pointing at one):  Did that one just move? 
 It did. The Ood opens its eyes and lifts its head. 
 DANNY : The telepathic field, it's reasserting itself. 
 ZACH : Move it, get to the rocket, move! 
 They hurry down the corridor. 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 The Doctor lies face down at the bottom of the pit. His helmet has shattered. He stirs, groaning. As he stands, he realises his helmet has broken and he gasps, a hand flying to his mouth. But then... 
 THE DOCTOR   (with wonder):  I'm breathing. 
 He removes the helmet and looks around. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Air cushion to support the fall...  (Turns on comm.).  You can breath down here, Ida.  (comm. Crackles).  Can you hear me, Ida? 
 INT. ROCKET 
 ZACH   (who is the pilot) : Dislocating B-Clamp, C-Clamp, raising blue nitrates to maximum. Toby, how's the negapact feed line? 
 TOBY : Clear! Ready to go, sir. For God's sakes, get us out of here! 
 Rose stirs. 
 DANNY   (noticing):  Captain... I think we're gonna have a problem passenger... 
 ZACH : Keep an eye on her. 
 ROSE : Wait... I'm not... 
 DANNY : It's all right, Rose, you're safe. 
 ROSE : I'm not going anywhere!  (Tugs at her seatbelt, shouting).  Get me out of this thing! Get me out! 
 ZACH : And... lift-off! 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE / THEPIT 
 The three men whoop and cheer as the rocket lifts off. Ida looks up, as does the Doctor at the bottom of the pit. 
 THE DOCTOR   (whispers):  A rocket... 
 He watches as it flies further and further away. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 Rose spots the bolt gun, she grabs it and points it at Zach. 
 ROSE : Take me back to the planet. 
 Zach doesn't reply. He doesn't even turn around. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (shouts):  Take me back! 
 ZACH : Or what? 
 ROSE : Or I'll shoot. 
 ZACH   (finally turning to her):  Would you, though? Would you really? Is that what your Doctor would want? 
 Rose holds his gaze for a moment. Danny looks slightly shaken. Defeated, Rose slumps back in her chair, dropping the gun. 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : Sorry, but it's too late anyway. Take a look outside. We can't turn back. This is what the Doctor would have wanted. 
 Rose looks out of the window. 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : Isn't that right? 
 They're speeding away from the black hole. 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 The Doctor shines his torch on the wall of the underground cavern, there are crude drawings of a horned beast and tiny stick figures surrounding it. 
 THE DOCTOR : History of some big battle. Man against Beast. I dunno if you're getting this, Ida. Hope so. Anyway, they defeated the Beast and imprisoned it. 
 The light of his torch falls on what looks like a large vase on a stand. Surprised, he turns the torch light back on the symbols of people carrying the vase on their heads. He approaches the vase, there is another one in line with the first. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Or maybe that's the key... 
 He touches the vase, and they both light up. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Or the gate, or the bars... 
 The Doctor turns upon hearing a quiet growl. His mouth opens, before him, in a pit, is a huge horned beast, chained down. It roars at him. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 In the rocket, Toby starts to laugh quietly to himself, as Rose does up her seatbelt again. 
 DANNY : What's the joke? 
 TOBY : Just... we made it. We escaped. We actually did it. 
 No one shares his mirth. 
 ROSE : Not all of us. 
 ZACH : We're not out of it yet. We're still the first people in history to fly away from a black hole. Toby, read me the stats. 
 TOBY   (still smirking):  Gravity funnel holding, sir. Always holding. 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 THE DOCTOR   (staring at the Beast):  I accept that you exist. I don't have to accept what you are, but you're physical existence, I'll give you that. 
 The Beast growls. The Doctor takes a few steps forwards. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : But I don't understand. I was expected down here. I was given a safe landing, and air. You need me for something. What for? 
 The Beast lunges forwards, straining against the chains holding him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (completely out of his depth) : Have I got to... I dunno, beg an audience? Or... is there a ritual? Some sort of incantation or summons or spell, all these things I don't believe in, are they real? 
 The Beast just looks at him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (loudly):  Speak to me! Tell me!  (No reply).  You won't talk. Or... you can't talk. Hold on, hold on. Wait a minute, just let me...  (He thinks hard).  Oh! No. Yes! No... think it through, you spoke before. I heard your voice. An intelligent voice. No, more than that, brilliant! But, looking at you now... all I can see...  (The Beast growls)  is...  (growl)  Beast. The animal. Just... the body. You're just the body, the physical form! What's happened to your mind? Hmm? Where's it gone? Where's that intelligence?  (He glances upwards as it dawns on him).  Oh, no... 
 INT. ROCKET 
 TOBY : Stats. at 53, funnel status at 66.5. Hull pressure constant. Smooth as we can, sir. All the way back home. 
 Rose stares out of the window, so sad. 
 TOBY (CONT'D) : Coordinates set for Planet Earth. 
 The corners of his mouth twitch upwards in an unpleasant smile. 
 INT. THE PIT 
 The Doctor shines his torch on the symbols covering the walls. 
 THE DOCTOR : You're imprisoned. Long time ago. Before the universe, after, sideways, in- between, doesn't matter. The positioning is perfect .  It's absolutely... it's eternal. Oh, yes! Open the prison, the gravity field collapses! This planet falls into the black hole! You escape, you die. Brilliant! But that's just the body. The body is trapped, that's all. The devil is just an idea. In all those civilisations, just an idea.  (He pauses, edging forwards as he works it out).  But an idea is hard to kill. An idea could escape. The mind, the mind of the great Beast, the mind can escape! Oh, but that's it! You didn't give me air, your jailers did! They set this up! All those years ago! They need me alive. Because if you're escaping, then I've gotta stop you. 
 The Beast roars in fury, straining against the chains. The Doctor picks up a rock. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : If I destroy your prison, your body is destroyed. Your mind with it. 
 He swings the rock over his head, ready to bring it crashing down on the vase, and then stops. He drops it. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : But then you're clever enough to use this whole system against me. If I destroy this planet, I destroy the gravity field. The rocket. The rocket loses protection and falls into the black hole. I'll have to sacrifice Rose. 
 He has a look of mild disgust on his face. The Beast laughs mirthlessly. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 ROSE   (thinking):  It doesn't make sense. We escaped, but there's a thousand ways it could've killed us. It could've... ripped out the air or... I dunno, burnt us, or anything. But it let us go. Why? Unless it wanted us to escape... 
 TOBY : Hey, Rose, do us a favour...  (Nastily).  Shut up. 
 Rose stares at him. He looks away. 
 TOBY (CONT'D) : Almost there. We'll be beyond the reach of the black hole in 40... 39... 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 THE DOCTOR : So, that's the trap. Or the test or the final judgment, I don't know. But if I kill you, I kill her. 
 The Beast laughs, then roars at him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Except that implies, in this big grand scheme of Gods and Devils, that she's just a victim. But I've seen a lot of this universe. I've seen fake gods and bad gods and demi gods and would-be gods, out of all that, out of that whole pantheon, if I believe in one thing... just one thing...  (with passion)  I believe in her. 
 And with that, he picks up the rock and smashes the vase. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 The rocket begins to shake violently. 
 DANNY : What happened? What was that?! 
 TOBY : What's he doing? What is he doing? 
 ZACH : We've lost the funnel! Gravity collapse! 
 ROSE : What does that mean? 
 ZACH : We can't escape. We're headed straight for the black hole! 
 The rocket turns back on itself and spirals towards the black hole. 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 The Doctor smashes the other vase. 
 THE DOCTOR : This is your freedom! Free to die. You're going into that black hole and I'm riding with you. 
 Flames fall from the Beast's mouth. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 ROSE   (looking out of the window):  It's the planet. The planet's moving. It's falling. 
 She sits back in her seat and glances at Toby, and reels backwards in shock. He's glaring at her, eyes red, the symbols have broken out onto his skin again. 
 TOBY   (in the Voice of the Beast):  I am the rage... 
 ROSE : It's Toby, Zach, do something... 
 TOBY   (speaking very fast, obviously fearful) : And the bile and the ferocity. 
 ROSE   (screaming):  Just do something! 
 TOBY : I am the Prince and the Fall and the Darkness... 
 DANNY : It's him! It's him! It's him! 
 ZACH : Stay where you are, the ship's not stable! 
 Toby expels a burst of flame from his mouth. 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : What is he?! What the hell is he?! 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 The Beast writhes around, burning up. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 TOBY : I shall never die! The thought of me is forever! In the bleeding hearts of men, in their vanity and obsession and lust... 
 Rose picks up the bolt gun. 
 TOBY (CONT'D) : Nothing shall ever destroy me. Nothing! 
 Rose points the gun at the front window. 
 ROSE   (darkly):  Go to hell. 
 She fires, shattering the glass, she undoes Toby's seatbelt and he is sucked through the window and into outer space, headed straight for the black hole. He roars in fear and anger. 
 ZACH : Emergency shield! 
 He presses a button and the emergency shield activates, covering the gaping hole. The rocket continues to shake and shudder, headed towards the black hole. 
 ZACH (CONT'D) : We've still lost the gravity funnel. We can't escape the black hole! 
 ROSE : But we stopped him. That's what the Doctor would've done. 
 ZACH : Some victory. We're going in. 
 The rocket continues to spirals towards the black hole. 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 The Beast is burning up, struggling against his chains. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 Danny looks at the computer screen. 
 DANNY   (terrified) : The planet's lost orbit! It's falling! 
 INT. CORRIDOR 
 The Ood fall around the corridor back in the base. 
 EXT. KROPTOR'S SURFACE 
 Ida falls down, unconscious from lack of oxygen. 
 EXT. THE PIT 
 The Doctor runs back down the tunnel, away from the Beast. A blast of air knocks him backwards, straight into something blue... he looks up, and beams. It's the TARDIS. He laughs with delight. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 The computer screen indicates the planet has fallen into the black hole, and then goes blank. 
 DANNY : The planet's gone.  (Rose says nothing).  I'm sorry. 
 ZACH : Accelerate. I did my best. But hey, first Human Beings to fall inside a black hole. How about that? History. 
 Rose closes her eyes. They hold on tight as the rocket shakes violently. They all have their eyes screwed shut, ready for the impact, when... it stops. Silence falls. 
 ROSE : What happened? 
 They all lean to one side as the rocket turns. 
 ZACH   (confused):  We're... turning.  (Looks at screen).  We're turning around. We're turning away! 
 The comm. springs to life. 
 THE DOCTOR   (through comm.):  Sorry about the hijack, Captain. This is the good ship TARDIS. 
 Rose's mouth drops open and her eyes light up. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Now, first thing's first, have you got a Rose Tyler on board? 
 INT. ROCKET 
 ROSE   (quickly, overjoyed):  I'm here! It's me! Oh, my God!  (Laughs and puts her hand over her face, giddy with relief and happiness).  Where are you? 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The TARDIS speeds away from the black hole, the rocket safely in tow. 
 THE DOCTOR   (voice-over) : I'm just towing you home. Gravity-schmavity. My people practically invented black holes. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Well, in fact, they did.  (Pulls a lever).  In a couple of minutes, we'll be nice and safe. Oh, and captain, can we do a swap? Say, if you give me Rose Tyler, I'll give you Ida Scott? How about that? 
 Ida is propped against a pillar, still unconscious. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 ZACH   (delighted):  She's alive! 
 DANNY : Yes! Thank God. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah! Bit of oxygen starvation, but she should be all right.  (More solemn).  I couldn't save the Ood. I only had time for one trip. They went down with the planet. 
 His computer bleeps. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Ah! Entering clear space, end of the line, mission closed. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 Rose smiles to herself, so happy and relieved and proud of him, all at the same time. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The TARDIS and the rocket zoom off into clear space. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose opens the door of the TARDIS. The Doctor looks up and smiles. They run to each other and the Doctor gathers Rose up into his arms, lifting her clean off the floor. They both giggle, so happy to see one another again. 
 INT. ROCKET 
 Ida is back with her friends in the rocket. 
 IDA : I don't know. I can't remember. 
 DANNY : Well, it looked like a box. 
 ZACH : What do you mean a box? 
 DANNY : Well, down in the hull. A big blue box. It just appeared! I don't know! 
 THE DOCTOR   (through comm.):  Zach? We'll be off, now. Have a good trip home. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor and Rose stand side by side at the TARDIS console. 
 THE DOCTOR : And the next time you get curious about something... oh... what's the point? You'll just go blundering in. The human race... 
 INT. ROCKET 
 IDA : But Doctor, what did you find down there? That creature, what was it? 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR : I don't know! Never did decipher that writing. But that's good! Day I know everything? Might as well stop. 
 ROSE : What do you think it was? Really? 
 THE DOCTOR : I think... we beat it. That's good enough for me. 
 ROSE : It said I was gonna die in battle. 
 The Doctor catches her eye. 
 THE DOCTOR   (with quiet confidence):  Then it lied. 
 Rose smiles. That's all she needs to reassure her. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Right, onwards, upwards, Ida, see you again, maybe! 
 INT. ROCKET 
 IDA : I hope so. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 ROSE : And thanks, boys! 
 INT. ROCKET 
 Zach and Danny grin. 
 IDA : Hang on though, Doctor. You never really said... you two... who are you?
