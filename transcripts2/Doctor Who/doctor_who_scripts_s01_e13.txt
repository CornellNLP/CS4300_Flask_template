 A recap of 112 "Bad Wolf". 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 INT. SPACESHIP 
 The Daleks are in a state of panic. One of them rounds on Rose. 
 DALEK 1 : You know the Doctor! You understand him! You will predict his actions! 
 ROSE : I don't know! 
 The Dalek glides dangerously towards her. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : And even if I did, I wouldn't tell ya... 
 DALEK 1   (slightly hysterical):  Predict! Predict! Predict! 
 DALEK 2   (distracting Dalek 1) : TARDIS detected. In flight. 
 DALEK 1 : Launch missiles! Exterminate! 
 ROSE   (desperately) : You can't! The TARDIS hasn't got any defences, you're gonna kill him! 
 DALEK 1 : You have predicted correctly. 
 Rose trembles. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 Two missiles are fired from the Dalek's ship towards the TARDIS, which is hurtling through space. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Jack and the Doctor are manning the controls frantically. The whole ship is shaking. 
 JACK : We've got incoming! 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The two missiles and the TARDIS hurtle towards each other and then collide, exploding with orange flame and obscuring the TARDIS from view. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 JACK : The extrapolator's working. We've got a fully functional forcefield. Try saying that when you're drunk... 
 THE DOCTOR   (operating the controls)  :  And for my next trick... 
 INT. SPACESHIP 
 The Daleks and Rose hear the sound of the TARDIS materialising. They look around. A breeze blows Rose's hair as she turns to see the faint outline of the TARDIS slowly appearing around her. It surrounds both her and one of the Daleks. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor's outline becomes more and more distinct, standing beside the console. When the engines have stopped... 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose! Get down! 
 Rose flounders. The Dalek's eyepiece swivels round. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Get down, Rose! 
 Rose throws herself to the floor. 
 DALEK 1 : Exterminate! 
 The Dalek fires at Jack, who is holding the Defabricator. With this, he deflects the ray back at the Dalek, who explodes with a scream. Rose winces. Smoke billows from the remains of the Dalek, and Rose struggles to her feet. 
 ROSE : You did it! 
 The TARDIS seems strangely silent after all the action. The Doctor goes over to Rose and without single word, puts his arms around her in a tight embrace. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Feels like I haven't seem you in years . 
 THE DOCTOR : Told you I'd come and get you. 
 They pull away slightly. 
 ROSE : Never doubted it. 
 THE DOCTOR : I did! You all right? 
 ROSE : Yeah. You? 
 THE DOCTOR : Not bad. Been better! 
 He goes over to the smouldering remains of the Dalek and peers at it while Jack approaches Rose. 
 JACK : Hey, don't Iget a hug? 
 ROSE : Ahh, come here! 
 JACK   (gesturing the Doctor)  :  I was talking to him. 
 They laugh and throw their arms around each other. 
 JACK : Welcome home! 
 ROSE : Ohh, thought I'd never see you again. 
 JACK : Oh, you were lucky, I was just a one-shot wonder. Drained the gun of all its power supply. Now it's just a piece of junk. 
 They Doctor carefully examines the Dalek with his sonic screwdriver. 
 INT. SPACESHIP 
 Outside the TARDIS, the Daleks shuffle around in a nervous silence. A deep voice - the voice of the Emperor Dalek, booms out. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : Patience, my brethren... 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The three of them bend over the Dalek, looking at it. The battle armour has been blasted away, giving them a clear view of the mutant inside. 
 ROSE : You said they were extinct. How comes they're still alive? 
 JACK : One minute they're the greatest threat in the universe, the next minute they vanished out of time and space. 
 THE DOCTOR   (examining it):  They went off to fight a bigger war... the Time War... 
 JACK   (surprised):  I thought that was just a legend. 
 THE DOCTOR : I was there. The war between the Daleks and the Time Lords. With the whole of creation at stake. My people were destroyed, but they took the Daleks with them. 
 The Dalek smoulders. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (quietly):  I almost thought it was worth it. Now it turns out they died for nothing. 
 ROSE : There's thousands of them now. We could hardly stop one .  What're we gonna do? 
 THE DOCTOR   (cheerfully)  :  No good stood round here chin-wagging! Human race, you'd gossip all day. The Daleks have got the answers, let's go and meet the neighbours. 
 And he heads off down the ramp. 
 ROSE   (urgently):  You can't go out there...! 
 But he has opened the door and stepped out. 
 INT. SPACESHIP 
 DALEKS : Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! 
 They fire their bolts of energy, but to no avail, the rays reflect off the forcefield of the TARDIS, keeping the Doctor safe, as well as Jack and Rose who have just cautiously popped their heads out behind him. The Daleks give up, and the sound of their guns fades into silence. The Doctor raises his hands mockingly. 
 THE DOCTOR : Is that it? Useless! Nul points.  (Leans against the TARDIS. To Jack and Rose).  It's all right, come on out. That forcefield can hold back anything. 
 JACK : Almostanything. 
 THE DOCTOR : ... Yes, but I wasn't gonna tell them that. Thanks. 
 JACK : Sorry. 
 The Daleks are silent, watching them. The Doctor steps forward to address them. 
 THE DOCTOR : D'you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the Dalek Homeworld? The Oncoming Storm. You might've removed all your emotions... but I reckon that right down deep in your DNA, there's one little spark left. And that's fear. 
 The Dalek's eyepieces twitch nervously. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Doesn't it just burnwhen you face me? So, tell me, how did you survive the Time War? 
 EMPEROR DALEK : They survived through me. 
 The Doctor has thus far not noticed the Emperor Dalek and he turns around, startled. He takes a few steps towards the voice, and the Dalek Emperor is illuminated, towering above all of them. The Doctor stares up at him in open-mouthed awe. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose... Captain... this is the Emperor of the Daleks. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : You destroyed us, Doctor. The Dalek Race died in your inferno, but my ship survived, falling through time, crippled but alive. 
 THE DOCTOR : I get it. 
 DALEK 1 : Do not interrupt! 
 DALEK 2 : Do not interrupt! 
 DALEK 3 : Do not interrupt! 
 Rose and Jack flinch and wince, but the Doctor merely looks mildly annoyed, still strong and unwavering. 
 THE DOCTOR : I thinkyou're forgetting something. I'm the Doctor. And if there's one thing I can do - it's talk. I've got five billion languages, and you haven't got  one  way of stopping me. So if anybody's gonna shut up, it's you! 
 He pronounces these last words with such fervour, that the Daleks shuffle backwards slightly. The Doctor turns back the the Emperor Dalek. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (light again):  Okey doke. So, where were we? 
 EMPEROR DALEK : We waited here in the dark space, damaged but rebuilding. Centuries passed, and we quietly infiltrated the systems of Earth. Harvesting the waste of humanity. The prisoners, the refugees, the dispossessed, they all came to us. The bodies were filtered, pulped, sifted. 
 Rose looks as though she has an extremely nasty taste in her mouth. 
 EMPEROR DALEK (CONT'D) : The seed of the Human Race is perverted. Only one cell in a billion was fit to be nurtured. 
 THE DOCTOR : So, you created an army of Daleks out of the dead. 
 ROSE : That makes them... half human. 
 EMPEROR DALEK   (voice rising):  Those words are blasphemy! 
 DALEK 1 : Do not blaspheme! 
 DALEK 2 : Do not blaspheme! 
 DALEK 3 : Do not blaspheme! 
 EMPEROR DALEK : Everything human has been purged. I cultivated pure and blessed Dalek. 
 But the Doctor is looking around at them all, clearly disturbed. 
 THE DOCTOR : Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy? 
 EMPEROR DALEK : I reached into the dirt and made new life. I am the God of all Daleks! 
 DALEKS : Worship him! Worship him! Worship him! 
 THE DOCTOR   (to Rose and Jack):  They're insane! A hundred years hiding in silence, that's enough to drive anyonemad.  (Stares intently at the Daleks, walking towards them, even pitying them).  But it's worse than that. Driven mad by your own flesh. The stink of humanity.  (Shakes his head, sad for them).  You hate your own existence. And that makes them more deadly than ever.  (To the Emperor Dalek):  We're going. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : You may notleave my presence! 
 But they're already halfway towards the TARDIS, none of the Daleks in power to stop them. 
 DALEK 1 : Stay where you are! 
 The Doctor grins at them mockingly before closing the door on them. 
 DALEKS : Exterminate! 
 They fire fruitlessly at the closed door, crying "exterminate". 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Once inside, the Doctor leans his head against the door and we now know that however confident he appears - the Doctor does not know what to do. He's helpless, the battle cries of the Daleks ringing in his ears. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Satellite floats serenely above the Earth in the sunlight. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 Lynda is on Floor 500, deep in thought, waiting for the Doctor and the others to come back. She perks up when she hears the sound of the TARDIS engines. A second later, the Doctor, Rose and Jack march out of the TARDIS, which has materialised at one end of Floor 500. 
 THE DOCTOR   (striding to the controls):  Turn everything up. All transmissions, wide open, full power. Now! Do it! 
 MALE PROGRAMMER   (obeying):  What does that do? 
 THE DOCTOR : Stops the Daleks from transmatting on board. How did you get on? Did you contact Earth? 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : Well, we tried to warn them, but all they did was suspend our license because we stopped the programmes. 
 THE DOCTOR : And the planet's just sitting there, defenceless.  (Notices Lynda).  Lynda, what're you still doing on board?  (Rounds on the Male Programmer).  I told you to evacuate everyone. 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : She wouldn't go. 
 LYNDA : Didn't wanna leave ya. 
 She smiles at him. Rose looks her up and down, clearly not liking her implication. 
 FEMALE PROGRAMMER : There weren't enough shuttles anyway, or  I  wouldn't be here... we've got about a hundred people stranded on Floor Zero. 
 INT. FLOOR ZERO 
 The people stranded on Floor Zero are milling around - Rodrick among them. 
 RODRICK   (to the guard)  :  Listen, listen, my name's Rodrick. I won the game! Where's my money? 
 The people are in a state of mild panic, but Rodrick does not seem to register this. 
 RODRICK   (yelling into an intercom):  Is anyone listening? Where's my money?! 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 MALE PROGRAMMER   (staring at the screen):  Oh, my God. The Fleet is moving. They're on their way. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Dalek ships begin to move smoothly across space. 
 INT. SPACESHIP 
 The Dalek Emperor is giving out orders while lines and lines of Daleks levitate above him, ready for battle. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : Purify the Earth with fire. The planet will become my temple and we shall rise. This will be our Paradise! 
 EXT. SPACE 
 And the ships move towards the Satellite, which is revolving slowly above the Earth. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 On Floor 500, the Doctor is frantically ripping armfuls of wires out of desks. The others watch him, clearly not knowing exactly what he's trying to do. 
 THE DOCTOR   (speaking quickly):  Dalek plan, big mistake. Because what have they left me with? Anyone? Anyone? Oh, come on, it's obvious. A great big transmitter, this station. 
 Jack is staring at him, brow furrowed in concentration, trying to work out what he's on about. 
 THE DOCTOR : If I can change the signal, fold it back, sequence it, anyone? 
 JACK (CONT'D)   (finally working it out):  You've gotta be kidding. 
 THE DOCTOR : Give the man a medal! 
 JACK   (incredulous)  :  A Delta Wave? 
 THE DOCTOR   (excitedly):  A Delta Wave! 
 ROSE : What's a Delta Wave? 
 JACK : A wave of Van Cassadyne energy. Fries your brain, stand in the way of a Delta Wave and your head gets barbequed! 
 THE DOCTOR : And this place can transmit a massivewave! Wipe out the Daleks! 
 Rose opens her mouth to say something but is interrupted by Lynda. 
 LYNDA : Well, get started and do it then! 
 Rose shuts her mouth again, disgruntled. 
 THE DOCTOR : Trouble is, wave this size, building this big, brain as clever as mine, should take about, ooh, three days? How long till the Fleet arrive? 
 MALE PROGRAMMER   (checking the computer):  Twenty-two minutes. 
 The Doctor frantically pulls another cable out from underneath the desk, stares at the end of it for a second, looks up and beams at them all. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Fleet glides smoothly towards the Satellite. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 JACK : We've now got a forcefield so they can't blast us out of the sky. 
 Rose, Lynda, the Male Programmer and the Female Programmer are gathered around the computer while Jack explains this to them. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : But that doesn't stop the Daleks from physically invading. 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : Do they know about the Delta Wave? 
 JACK : They'll have worked it out at the same time. So, if they want to stop the Doctor, that means they've got to get to this level, 500.  (Indicates the illustrative diagram on the screen).  Now, I can concentrate the extrapolator around the top six levels, 500 to 495. So, they'll penetrate the station below that at level 494 and fight their way up. 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : Who're they fighting? 
 JACK : Us. 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : And... what're we fighting with? 
 JACK : The guards had guns with bastic bullets, that's enough to blow a Dalek wide open. 
 FEMALE PROGRAMMER   (skeptically):  There's fiveof us. 
 THE DOCTOR   (calling from where he's busying himself with the wires):  Rose, you can help me. I need all these wires stripped bare. 
 Rose joins him immediately. 
 FEMALE PROGRAMMER : Right! Now there's fourof us! 
 JACK : Then let's move it! Into the lift! Isolate the lift controls! 
 The Male and Female Programmer hurry off, and Lynda approaches the Doctor. He stands up to meet her. 
 LYNDA : I, I just wanna say, um... thanks, I s'pose. And... I'll do my best! 
 THE DOCTOR : Me too. 
 They awkwardly try to decide on the best way of saying goodbye, at one point the Doctor looks as though he's going to kiss her forehead, but they settle for a handshake. They laugh embarrassedly, while Rose looks absolute daggers in the background. Lynda heads off, glancing back at the Doctor who watches her go. Rose, looking like murder but evidently deciding not to comment, strips a wire with unnecessary ferocity. She drops it to the ground as Jack approaches them and stands before them, ready to say his goodbyes. 
 JACK   (trying to keep it light):  It's been fun! 
 The Doctor smiles. 
 JACK (CONT'D)   (serious, now):  But I guess this is goodbye. 
 ROSE : Don't talk like that. The Doctor's gonna do it. You just watch him. 
 JACK : Rose...  (Cups her face in both his hands and looks her intensely in the eyes. Sincerely):  You are worth fighting for. 
 He places a brief kiss on her lips before turning to the Doctor. 
 JACK (CONT'D)   (grinning)  :  Wish I'd never met you, Doctor! (C ups his face in both hands).  I was much better off as a coward. 
 And he kisses him in exactly the same way as he kissed Rose. He places a hand on each of their shoulders, then points forward to the exit. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : See ya in hell. 
 And he runs off. The Doctor and Rose watch him leave, before Rose turns back to the Doctor. 
 ROSE   (nervously, trying to make herself believe it):  He's gonna be all right... 
 The Doctor looks at her. No reply. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (needing an answer)  :  ... isn't he? 
 EXT. SPACE 
 View moves slowly down the Satellite. 
 INT. FLOOR ZERO 
 Jack is standing on a box in the middle of Floor Zero, surround by the stranded contestants, who are babbling away with panic. He fires a few shots of his fun into the air for order. They jump, and then fall silent. 
 JACK : One last time. Any more volunteers? 
 Deadly silence. There are are group of seven volunteers slightly separate from the others, including Lynda and the Male and Female Programmer. A few of the contestants shake their heads. 
 JACK (CONT'D)   (quiet urgency) : There's an army about to invade this station. I need every last citizen to monitor defence! 
 RODRICK   (pushing forwards):  Don't listen to him! There aren't any Daleks! They disappeared thousands of years ago! 
 Despite his words, the Floor Manager puts herself forward. She nods at Jack, who nods back gratefully. 
 JACK : Thanks. As for the rest of you... the Daleks will enter the station at Floor 494 and as far as I can tell, they'll head up. Not down. But that's not a promise. So here's a few words of advice; keep quiet. And if you hear fighting up above... if you hear us  dying... then  tell me that the Daleks aren't real. 
 He glares pointedly at Rodrick. A short silence follows his words. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Don't make a sound.  (To the volunteers):  Let's go. 
 He jumps off the box and heads towards the lifts. He and the eight volunteers bundle inside, and the doors close on them. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Satellite revolving. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 Rose and the Doctor are sitting on the floor in the space between the middle row of desks, working busily in a companionable silence. They're now the only two people left on Floor 500. 
 ROSE : Suppose... 
 But she does not finish her sentence. 
 THE DOCTOR   (after a moment):  What? 
 ROSE : Nothing. 
 THE DOCTOR : You said: suppose. 
 ROSE : No, I was just thinking... I mean, obviously you can't, but... you've got a time machine. Why can't you just go back to last week and warn them? 
 THE DOCTOR   (not looking up from his work) : Soon as the TARDIS lands in that second, I become part of events. Stuck in the timeline. 
 ROSE   (as though this is exactly the answer she was expecting):  Yeah, thought it'd be something like that... 
 She carries on working. 
 THE DOCTOR : There's another thing the TARDIS could do... it could take us away... 
 Rose glances briefly up at him with a small smile. 
 THE DOCTOR : We could leave. Let history take its course. We go to Marbella in 1989. 
 ROSE   (softly, smiling):  Yeah, but you'd never do that. 
 THE DOCTOR   (meeting her eyes):  No, but you could ask. 
 Rose does not reply... 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (with quiet affection):  Never even occurred to you, did it? 
 ROSE : Well, I'm just too good! 
 And the Doctor's just smiling at her like she means the world to him. The computer whirrs in the background and the Doctor looks over at it, suddenly alert. 
 THE DOCTOR : The Delta Wave's started building. How long does it need? 
 And they both leap to their feet and rush over to the computers. The Doctor plonks himself in one of the chairs and Rose peers over his shoulder. He presses a few buttons, stares at the monitor... and his face falls. 
 ROSE : Is that bad? 
 No reply. His head is sinking to his knees. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Okay, it's bad. How bad is it? 
 The Doctor suddenly perks up and leaps to his feet, eyes bright. 
 THE DOCTOR   (gleeful):  Rose Tyler, you're a genius! 
 Rose smiles eagerly. He places a smacking kiss on her forehead. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : We can do it! If I use the TARDIS to cross my old timeline... yes! 
 And he shoots off towards the TARDIS, Rose close behind. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 They go through the doors and over to the console. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (indicating a lever):  Hold that down and keep position. 
 ROSE   (breathless):  What's it do? 
 THE DOCTOR   (looking busy at the computer)  :  Cancels the buffers. If I'm very clever, and I'm more than clever, I'm brilliant ,  I might just save the world. Or rip it apart... 
 ROSE   (holding the lever down):  I'd go for the first one. 
 THE DOCTOR : Me too. Now, I've just got to go and power up the Game Station. Hold on! 
 He runs out of the TARDIS again, full of energy... 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The door shuts behind him... and then he stops. He turns around slowly to look at the TARDIS and he looks so, so sad. And we realise what he's about to do. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose waits for him with wide-eyed expectancy, completely oblivious. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The Doctor raises his sonic screwdriver and points it at the TARDIS. The engines groan and the rotor starts to rise and fall. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 ROSE   (yelling in the direction of the doors):  Doctor, what're you doing? Can I take my hand off? It's moving. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The Doctor does not lower his sonic screwdriver. He carries on pointing it at the TARDIS. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose abandons the lever and and runs across the room, throwing herself against the doors. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (panicking):  Doctor, let me out! 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The TARDIS begins to fade away... 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (hammering on the door):  Let me out! Doctor, what've you done? 
 But her cries are becoming more and more distant as the TARDIS fades into nothingness. And in a moment, it is gone completely and the Doctor is facing an empty space. He finally lowers his sonic screwdriver and turns away, so tired and sad. 
 EXT. TIME VORTEX 
 The TARDIS falls through the time vortex. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose is still pounding frantically on the door when a hologram of the Doctor appears standing next to the console, flickering slightly. Rose spins around when she hears him speak. 
 THE DOCTOR : This is Emergency Programme One. Rose, now listen, this is important. If this message is activated, then it can only mean one thing. 
 Rose stares, wide-eyed. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : We must be in danger. And I mean fatal. I'm dead or about to die any second with no chance of escape. 
 ROSE   (lunging forwards):  No! 
 THE DOCTOR : And that's okay. Hope it's a good death. 
 Rose stops at the top of the ramp, just staring at him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : But I promised to look after you, and that's what I'm doing. The TARDIS is taking you home. 
 ROSE : I won't let you. 
 She rushes up the remainder of the steps. The Doctor's hologram continues to stare ahead of him, not looking at her. 
 THE DOCTOR : And I bet you're fussing and moaning now, typical. But hold on and just listen a bit more. The TARDIS can never return for me. Emergency Programme One means I'm facing an enemy that should never get their hands on this machine. So this is what you should do: let the TARDIS die. 
 Rose's mouth drops open ever so slightly in distress. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Just let this old box gather dust. No one can open it, no one will even notice it. Let it become a strange little thing standing on a street corner. And over the years, the world will move on and the box will be buried. And if you want to remember me, then you can do one thing. That's all. One thing.  (His head turns to face her, his eyes full of compassion, as if he knows she's there. His voice sounds less distorted).  Have a good life. Do that for me, Rose. Have a fantastic life. 
 Rose just watches - can do nothing but look on as the hologram flickers before fading altogether. 
 ROSE : You can't do this to me.  (Strides over to the console).  You can't.  (Rages at the TARDIS, slamming down every available button and lever, yelling in desperation).  Take me back! Take me back! 
 The pain is evident on her face as she rattles at the controls, having no effect whatsoever on the TARDIS. The engines eventually die down and grind to a halt. Rose abandons the console, runs across the room, flings open the doors and rushes outside... 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Rose finds herself looking up at the block of flats where she lives on a grey and dismal day. She runs back inside, refusing to accept what has happened. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 ROSE   (rattling the controls, raging at the TARDIS):  Come on, fly. How do you fly? Come on, HELP ME! 
 But to no avail. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Mickey rushes in to view from round a corner at the end of the road and bolts down the street in time to see Rose stepping slowly out of the TARDIS doors, defeated. She leans against the side as he catches up with her. 
 MICKEY   (striding towards her):  I knew it! I was all the way down Clifton's Parade, and I heard the engines and I thought 'there's only one thing that makes a noise like that'.  (As he gets closer, he realises that she is in tears. Concerned).  What is it? 
 But Rose says nothing as she reaches blindly out to him, clinging to him with her eyes screwed up against the pain and the tears. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Satellite rotates calmly above the Earth. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The Doctor is working alone. 
 JACK   (over intercom):  Rose, I've called up the internal laser codes. There should be a different number on every screen, can you read them out to me? 
 THE DOCTOR : She's not here. 
 JACK : Of all the times to take a leak! When she gets back, tell her to read me the codes! 
 THE DOCTOR : She's not comingback. 
 JACK   (wrong-footed):  What d'you mean? Where'd she go? 
 THE DOCTOR : Just get on with your work. 
 JACK   (realising):  You took her home, didn't you? 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah. 
 Jack nods, not at all surprised. He realises how hopeless their situation is. 
 JACK : The Delta Wave... is it ever gonna be ready? 
 EMPEROR DALEK : Tell him the truth ,  Doctor. 
 And the Doctor looks up to see an image of the Emperor Dalek projected onto the screen. 
 EMPEROR DALEK (CONT'D) : There is every possibility that the Delta Wave could be complete, but no possibility of refining it. The Delta Wave must kill every living thing in its path, with no distinction between Human and Dalek. All things will die. By your hand. 
 The Doctor does not answer. 
 JACK   (warningly)  :  Doctor... the range of this transmitter covers the entire Earth. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : You would destroy Daleks and Humans together. If I am God, the creator of all things, then what does that make you ,  Doctor? 
 THE DOCTOR : There are colonies out there. The Human Race would survive in some shape or form, but you're the only Daleks in existence. The whole universe is in danger if I let you live. 
 The Doctor looks back at Jack on the other screen. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Do you see, Jack? That's the decision I've got to make for every living thing. Die as a Human or live as a Dalek.  (Appeals to him for an answer, completely helpless).  What would you do? 
 JACK : You sent her home. She's safe. Keep working. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : But he will exterminate you! 
 JACK   (grinning):  Never doubted him, never will. 
 And the Doctor grins back and leaps to his feet, energised by Jack's trust. He strides across the room to the screen. 
 THE DOCTOR : Now, you tell me, "God of all Daleks", 'cos there's one thing I never worked out. The words "Bad Wolf", spread across time and space. Everywhere, drawing me in. How'd you manage that? 
 EMPEROR DALEK : I did nothing. 
 THE DOCTOR   (skeptical):  Oh, come on. There's no secrets now, your worship. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : They are not part of my design. 
 A short pause while the Doctor stares at him, baffled. 
 EMPEROR DALEK (CONT'D) : This is the Truth of God. 
 The Doctor raises his eyes to where 'Bad Wolf Corporation' is written in huge letters high on the wall. 
 INT. CHIP SHOP 
 A few pigs revolve slowly, cooking in an oven. 
 JACKIE : And it's gone up-market, this place. They're doing little tubs of coleslaw, now. 
 Mickey and Jackie are sitting at a table in a completely ordinary chip shop, Rose opposite them. Mickey and Jackie are tucking in, but Rose's box is untouched. She's gazing out of the window, not taking in a single word of the conversation. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : It's not very nice. Tastes a bit sort of clinical. 
 MICKEY   (glancing at Rose)  :  Have you tried that new pizza place down Minto Road? 
 JACKIE : What's it selling? 
 MICKEY : Pizza. 
 JACKIE : Oh, that's nice. 
 Rose gazes out of the window with a faraway look in her eyes, looking incredibly downcast. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : Do they deliver? 
 MICKEY : Yeah! 
 Jackie takes another look at Rose, and then abandons all pretence of having an ordinary conversation. 
 JACKIE   (pleading):  Oh, Rose. Have something to eat... 
 ROSE   (voice trembling, eyes not leaving the window):  Two hundred thousand years in the future, he's dying, and there's nothingI can do. 
 JACKIE : Well, like you said, two hundred thousand years, it's way off! 
 ROSE   (finally looking at her):  But it's not! It's now! That fight is happening right now, and he's fighting for us! For the whole planet, and I'm just sittinghere eating chips! 
 She's angry and upset. 
 JACKIE : Listen to me. 
 Rose turns to face her, reluctantly falling silent. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : God knows I have hated that man, but right now, I love him, and d'you know why? Because he did the right thing. He sent you back to me. 
 And she returns her attention back to the chips, as though the matter is closed. 
 ROSE   (desperate) : But what do I do every day, mum? What do I do? Get up, catch the bus, go to work, come back home, eat chipsand go to bed? Is that it? 
 MICKEY   (coldly):  It's what the rest of us do. 
 ROSE : But I can't! 
 MICKEY : Why, 'cos you're better than us? 
 ROSE   (frustrated):  No, I didn't mean that! 
 She pauses, trying to calm herself down. Jackie watches her. 
 ROSE   (quietly)  :   But it was... it was a betterlife. And I, I don't mean all the travelling and... seeing aliens and spaceships and things, that don't matter. The Doctor showed me a better way of livingyour life.  (Meets their eyes, speaking earnestly. To Mickey):  You know, he showed you too.  (Passionately):  That you don't just give up. You don't just let things happen. You make a stand. You say no. You have the guts to do what's right when everyone else just runs away, and I just can't... 
 She breaks off, unable to carry on. She kicks the table in frustration and leaps to her feet, running out of the chip shop in despair. Jackie and Mickey glance at one another. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 Jack is instructing Lynda over a terminal. 
 JACK : Right, Lynda, you are my eyes and ears. When the Daleks get in, you can follow it on that screen and report it to me. 
 LYNDA : Understood. 
 JACK : They'll detect you but the door's made of Hydra Combination. Should keep them out. 
 LYNDA : Should? 
 JACK : It's the best I can do.  (Speaks into his wrist device).  How long till the Fleet arrives? 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : They've accelerated. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Fleet has already arrived, their spaceships flying around the Satellite and the Earth. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 JACK : This is it, ladies and gentlemen! We are at war! 
 He leaves the deck. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 Rows and rows of Daleks fly smoothly from their ships and across space, towards the Satellite. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE, PLAYGROUND 
 Rose is sitting on a bench, staring into space. Mickey stands over her. 
 MICKEY : You can't spend the rest of your life thinking about the Doctor. 
 ROSE : But how do I forget him? 
 MICKEY : You've got to start living your own life. 
 Rose looks up at him. 
 MICKEY (CONT'D) : You know, a proper life, like the kind he's never had. The sort of life that you could have with me. 
 But Rose's attention has already wandered. She has noticed the words "BAD WOLF" written in huge letters on the playground floor in spray paint. The camera pans out to reveal the words in all their glory... astonished, Rose stands up and walks over to them. Mickey follows. Rose then realizes that "Bad Wolf"is graffiti'd all over the playground walls as well. 
 ROSE : Over here. It's over here as well! 
 She dashes over to the wall to examine the graffiti. 
 MICKEY   (calling after her):  That's been there for years! It's just a phrase! It's just words! 
 ROSE   (excitement building)  :  I thought it was a warning... maybe it's the opposite. Maybe it's a message .  The same words written down now and two hundred thousand years in the future. It's a link between me and the Doctor! Bad Wolf here... Bad Wolf there! 
 MICKEY : But if it's a message, what's it saying? 
 ROSE   (already running off):  It's telling me I can get back! The least I can do is help him escape! 
 INT. FLOOR 499 
 The volunteers are getting themselves ready to face the Daleks. 
 JACK : Stand your ground, everyone... follow my commands. And good luck. 
 The Male Programmer hands a gun to the Female Programmer. 
 
 
 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 Lynda watches the screen. 
 LYNDA   (over intercom):  You were right! They're forcing the airlock on 494. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The Doctor is going into overdrive, he's working so fast. The Satellite shudders violently. 
 INT. FLOOR ZERO 
 Feeling the shudder, the contestants stranded on Floor Zero all look up, alarmed. 
 INT. FLOOR 494 
 Rows of Daleks glide smoothly onto Floor 494 in perfect formation. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 ROSE   (hopeful and lively):  All the TARDIS needs to do is make a return trip. Just... reverse. 
 MICKEY : Yeah, but we still can't do it. 
 ROSE : The Doctor always said the TARDIS is telepathic. This thing is alive.It can listen. 
 MICKEY : It's not listening now, is it? 
 ROSE : We need to get inside it. Last time I saw you, with the Slitheen, this middle bit opened... 
 Flashback to the console being ripped open in 1x11 "Boom Town". A blinding white light floods out from underneath it. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : And there was this light... and the Doctor said it was the heart of the TARDIS. If we can open it, we can make contact. I can tell it what to do! 
 MICKEY : Rose... 
 ROSE : Mm? 
 MICKEY   (quietly)  :  If you go back, you're gonna die. 
 ROSE   (completely confident):  That's a risk I've gotta take. 'Cos there's nothing left for me here. 
 MICKEY : Nothing? 
 ROSE : No. 
 She looks away, avoids Mickey's eye. That hurts him so much and she knows it, but it has to be said. 
 MICKEY   (with dignity):  Okay, if that's what you think... let's get this thing open. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Satellite revolves. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 Lynda is monitoring the Dalek's progress on the screen. She watches the red lights that indicate the Daleks moving slowly down a corridor. 
 INT. FLOOR 494, CORRIDOR 
 We see the Dalek in reality, gliding round a corner and nearing the waiting volunteers. Jack communicates with them via his wrist device. 
 JACK   (voice over) : Okay, activate internal lasers. Slice 'em up. 
 The Floor Manager places her hand on one of the touch sensitive pads. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 A bleeping sound. 
 LYNDA   (nervously):  Defences have gone offline. The Dalek's have overridden the lock. 
 INT. FLOOR 494, CORRIDOR 
 A row of Daleks move dangerously down the corridor. The volunteers ready their guns and get into position. They begin to shoot - but this has absolutely no affect whatsoever on the Daleks. The bullets melt away before they even touch the armour. 
 FLOOR MANAGER   (yelling into communication device):  You lied to me! The bullets don't work! 
 She carries on firing, and a second later, one of the Daleks shoots its death ray at her. She shouts in pain. The screen briefly goes negative, revealing her skeleton... and then she slumps to the floor, dead. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Mickey's releases the handbrake of his Beetle. He starts the engines, a look of determination on his face. The Beetle is hooked up with a thick, strong chain. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The other end of the chain is attached to the TARDIS console. Rose stands by it. 
 ROSE :  Faster! 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Mickey slams his foot down, trying so hard that steam is billowing from underneath the car, but still, the console refuses to budge. 
 MICKEY   (yells):  Come on! 
 The wheels spin uselessly on the spot. 
 ROSE : It's not moving! 
 Mickey growls with the effort, the chain becoming more and more taut but still to no avail. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose chews her lip with anticipation. The chain shudders... then snaps. Rose yelps in frustration, kicks the console and leans on it, head down. Defeated again. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 LYNDA :  Advance guard have made it to 495. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 THE DOCTOR   (through intercom):  Jack, how're we doing? 
 INT. FLOOR 499 
 JACK   (through wrist device):  495 should be good. I like 495. 
 INT. FLOOR 495 
 Three Daleks glide onto floor 495, suddenly alerted. 
 DALEK 1 : Identify yourself! 
 ANNE DROID : You are the weakest link. Goodbye! 
 The Anne Droid fires three times in quick succession at each of the Daleks, who are disintegrated. 
 INT. FLOOR 499 
 Jack, upon hearing this, punches the air in triumph. 
 JACK   (ecstatically):  Yes! 
 INT. FLOOR 495 
 Another Dalek glides onto floor 495. The Anne Droid cocks her head towards it. 
 ANNE DROID : You are the weakest link... 
 The Dalek fires and blows her head off. 
 ANNE DROID (CONT'D)   (power failing):  Goodbye. 
 DALEK 1 : Proceed to next level. 
 They glide forwards. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 LYNDA : They're flying up the ventilation shafts! 
 The diagram on the screen shows the red lights that represent the Daleks doing just that. 
 LYNDA (CONT'D) : No... wait a minute... oh, my God! Why're they doing that? They're going down! 
 For the Daleks are now heading down the ventilation shafts. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Satellite, view moving slowly downwards following the Dalek's progress. 
 INT. FLOOR ZERO 
 The stranded contestants on Floor Zero sit in a nervous silence, when suddenly... 
 DALEK : Exterminate! 
 The Daleks are gliding through the doors. The contestants all leap to their feet, panicking and screaming and trying to get away. But there are too many of them, all intoning "exterminate! ". 
 RODRICK   (in terror):  You can't! You don't exist! 
 A Dalek advances dangerous on him. 
 RODRICK (CONT'D)   (backing against a wall) : It's not fair! I won the game! I should be rich! I'm a winner, you can't do this to me! 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 Lynda, on the observation deck, can hear the screaming of the dying people on Floor Zero, the cries of "exterminate! " and the sound of the ray guns. She clicks the sound off, horrified, not wanting to hear any more. She puts her hands to her mouth, fighting back the tears. She opens communication again. 
 LYNDA : Floor Zero. They killed them all. 
 Her eyes fill with tears and she puts her hand over her mouth to stifle a sob. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose is slumped in one of the chairs next to the TARDIS console, broken, defeated, and staring into space. Jackie's standing over her. 
 JACKIE   (consoling, gentle):  It was never gonna work, sweetheart. And the Doctor knewthat. He just wanted you to be safe. 
 ROSE : I can't give up. 
 JACKIE : Lock the door. Walk away. 
 ROSE : Dad wouldn't give up. 
 JACKIE : Well, he's not here, is he? 
 Rose stares at her in silence for a few seconds. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) :  And even if he was, he'd say the same. 
 ROSE : No, he wouldn't. 
 Jackie stares at her. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : He'd tell me to try anything. If I could save the Doctor's life... try anything. 
 JACKIE : Well, we're never gonna know. 
 ROSE : Well, I know. 'Cos I met him. I met Dad. 
 JACKIE   (quietly):  Don't be ridiculous. 
 ROSE   (sitting up):  The Doctor took me back in time, and I met Dad. 
 JACKIE : Don't say that. 
 ROSE : Remember when Dad died...? There was someone with him. 
 Her voice begins to crack under the pressure of her suppressed tears. Jackie just stares at her, finding this hard to take in. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : A girl. A blonde girl. She held his hand... 
 No reply. Jackie's still just staring. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (frustrated, tears running down her cheeks):  You saw her from a distance, mum! You sawher! Think about it! That was me .  You saw me... 
 JACKIE   (abruptly):  Stop it. 
 ROSE : That's how good the Doctor is... 
 JACKIE   (shouting now, not wanting to hear this):  Stop it! Just stop it! 
 And she runs from the TARDIS, crying, leaving Rose alone. Rose's whole body is shaking with grief as she sobs her heart out. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The Satellite and the Dalek ship are both hovering above the Earth, rotating slowly.

 THE DOCTOR   (through intercom, hard at work):  Lynda! What's happening on Earth? 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 Lynda watches the Fleet glide smoothly down to Earth. 
 LYNDA   (hushed):  The Fleet's descending... they're bombing whole continents. Europa... Pacifica... the New American Alliance... 
 The diagram on the screen shows waves of red light radiating from the continents as she says their names. 
 LYNDA (CONT'D) : Australasia's just... gone. 
 INT. SPACESHIP 
 DALEK EMPEROR : This is perfection. I have created Heaven on Earth. 
 INT. FLOOR 499 
 Jack hurries onto Floor 499, carrying a gun. 
 JACK   (to remaining volunteers)  :  Floor 499. We're the last defence. The bullets should work if you concentrate them on the Dalek's eyestalk. I've got the forcefield at maximum so the Dalek fire part should be at its weakest. 
 He positions himself with the other volunteers behind the barricade, waiting for the Daleks to arrive. 
 MALE PROGRAMMER   (to Female Programmer):  I'm only here 'cos of you. I joined the Programme because... you were on it. 
 FEMALE PROGRAMMER : Am I supposed to say, when this is all over and if we're still alive, maybe we could go for a drink? 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : That'd be nice. 
 FEMALE PROGRAMMER : Yeah, well, tough. 
 He looks around at her. She winks at him and they smile at each other. They then release the safety catches of their guns, ready to fire. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Mickey and Rose are leaning against Mickey's car, looking at the TARDIS. 
 MICKEY : There's gotta be something else we can do. 
 ROSE : Mum was right... maybe we should just lock the door and walk away. 
 MICKEY : I'm not having that. I'm not having you just... just give up now. No way. We just need something stronger than my car... something bigger... something like that! 
 And they both turn around as they hear the roar of an engine. They see a huge recovery truck drive around the corner, driven by Jackie. Rose grins in amazement. It comes to a halt and Jackie climbs out. She strides towards them. 
 JACKIE : Right. You've only got this until six o' clock, so get on with it. 
 ROSE   (amused, astonished)  :  Mum, where the hell did you get that from? 
 JACKIE : Rodrigo. He owes me a favour. Never mind why, but you were right about your dad, sweetheart. He was full of mad ideas, and this is exactlywhat he would've done. Now, get on with it before I change my mind. 
 She chucks the keys to Mickey, who catches them with a nod of thanks. Rose runs back into the TARDIS and Mickey hurries to the door of the pickup truck. 
 INT. FLOOR 499 
 The volunteers have their guns positioned behind the barricade. They are out of sight, waiting for the Daleks. The POV of a Dalek - the doors slide open. 
 JACK : Open fire! 
 The volunteers fire madly in the direction of the Daleks On Floor 500, the Doctor hears the sound of the gunshots as he dashes around, working frantically. The Daleks advance, unaffected by the bullets. They face the barricades. The Male Programmer jumps down and shouts to Jack. 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : It's not working! 
 JACK : Concentrate your fire! Eyestalk, two o' clock! 
 The volunteers continue to fire, the bullets falling uselessly to the floor with a clatter before they can even touch the Daleks. One of the bullets, however, manages to catch the eyestalk of one of the Daleks and his vision goes blank. 
 DALEK : My vision is impaired! I cannot see! 
 FEMALE PROGRAMMER : We did it! 
 But she pays for letting her concentration slip, a bolt hits her and she slumps backwards, dead. 
 MALE PROGRAMMER : No! Nooooo! 
 He shouts with rage and stands, firing madly over the top of the barricade, no longer caring about the consequences. He too is hit with a bolt, and he is thrown backwards. Jack carries on firing, roaring with anger. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 Lynda's computer is beeping. 
 LYNDA : I've got a problem... 
 The beeping subsides, and Lynda looks uneasily at the door. 
 DALEK   (from outside):  Human female detected. 
 A deadly silence. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OUTSIDE OBSERVATION DECK 
 There are two Daleks outside, one of which touches the pad next to the door. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 Lynda looks at the door with apprehension. 
 LYNDA   (fearful):  They've found me. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 THE DOCTOR   (through intercom, still working):  You'll be all right, Lynda. That side of the station's reinforced against meteors. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 LYNDA   (trying to keep it light):  Hope so! Know what they say about Earth Workmanship... 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OUTSIDE OBSERVATION DECK 
 Outside the door, another Dalek advances with what looks like a small blow-torch. The Dalek places the flame onto one of the joins of the door. 
 INT. FLOOR 56, OBSERVATION DECK 
 From the inside, Lynda can only see the flame coming through the crack, sparking. Then, as if sensing something behind her, she turns slowly back to the window. Her eyes widen in shock. There are three Daleks rising into view outside. The dome-lights on the head of the Dalek at the front flash four times, indicating four syllables... and it fires. The window smashes, and Lynda screams. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 Upon hearing her scream, the Doctor looks up with shock. 
 INT. FLOOR 499, CORRIDOR 
 Jack is running backwards down a corridor, firing at the Dalek perusing him. 
 JACK   (yelling)  :  Last man standing! For God's sake, Doctor, finish that thing and kill them! 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The Doctor, still working, hears the Dalek Emperor's voice, sees him on the screen. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : Finish that thing and kill mankind. 
 The Doctor, after pausing to listen to this, carries on working frantically. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 One end of the chain has now been fixed to the truck and other to the console. Jackie watches by the TARDIS doors. Mickey is at the wheel, Rose by the console. The chain is stretching and stretching. 
 ROSE   (shouting out to Jackie):  Keep going! 
 JACKIE   (calling to Mickey):  Put your foot down! 
 Mickey does so. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 ROSE : Faster! 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE

 Mickey roars with the effort.

 INT. TARDIS 
 The chain becomes more and more taut, the metal creaking even more loudly in protest. 
 ROSE : Keep going! 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 JACKIE : Give it some more! 
 Mickey growls, putting his foot down as hard as he can. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Finally, the catch rips off and the panel flies open. A blinding white light pours out. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 The pickup truck lurches forward as the chain goes slack. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose steps forward to look into the light, and it reflects onto her face so she shines with a golden light. A breeze blows her hair and suddenly, the light flows into her eyes in two golden streams. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 MICKEY : Rose! 
 He rushes towards the TARDIS but the doors slam shut before he can reach it. Jackie covers her mouth with her hands with shock. She pulls Mickey back as the engines groan into life. The TARDIS dematerialises, rays of light shining from the windows, a wind blowing up around it... and then it is gone. Jackie looks at Mickey, completely bewildered. Mickey is breathing very heavily, staring at the spot where it disappeared. 
 INT. FLOOR 500, CORRIDOR 
 Jack is still running backwards down the corridor, shooting vainly at the Daleks advancing on him. 
 JACK : Doctor, you've got twenty seconds maximum! 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The Doctor throws equipment together, dashing around like a madman. 
 EXT. TIME VORTEX 
 The TARDIS hurtles through the time vortex with unnatural speed. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The golden time vortex streams into Rose's eyes as she stares into it as though hypnotised, a breeze blowing her hair. 
 INT. FLOOR 500, CORRIDOR 
 Jack's bullets run out as he reaches the end of the corridor. He tosses the Defabricator aside and produces another smaller gun, and begins firing that instead, but to no avail. The Daleks advance, untouched until finally the gun clicks, empty, and Jack is backed up against a wall with no weapon and facing three Daleks. He faces them squarely, defiantly. 
 DALEK 1 : Exterminate! 
 They raise their guns. 
 JACK : I kinda figured that. 
 He opens his arms slightly, ready. The Dalek fires and Jack slumps down against the wall, dead. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 The Doctor pulls up the lever of the device he has put together. 
 THE DOCTOR   (amazed):  It's ready! 
 He looks up as the Daleks begin to file into the room, surrounding him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You really wanna think about this. 'Cos if I activate the signal, every living creature dies. 
 EMPEROR DALEK   (on the screen):  I am immortal. 
 THE DOCTOR : D'you wanna put that to the test? 
 EMPEROR DALEK : I want to see you become like me .  Hail the Doctor, the Great Exterminator! 
 THE DOCTOR   (angry, placing his hands on the lever):  I'll do it! 
 EMPEROR DALEK : Then prove yourself, Doctor. What are you: coward or killer? 
 The Doctor's hands tense on the lever. He shakes, his face screwed up in pain. Then, he just lets it go. 
 THE DOCTOR : Coward. Any day. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : Mankind will be harvested because of yourweakness. 
 THE DOCTOR : And what about me? Am I becoming one of your angels? 
 EMPEROR DALEK : You are the Heathen. You will be exterminated. 
 THE DOCTOR   (unresisting)  :  Maybe it's time. 
 And he closes his eyes, ready. The Daleks all around him. Suddenly, one of the Dalek's eyepieces swivels around as we hear the sound of the TARDIS engines. It begins to fade in at exactly the point where it left. 
 DALEK 1 : Alert! TARDIS materialising! 
 The Doctor's eyes snap open and he spins around in shock. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : You will not escape! 
 The TARDIS has fully materialised and the doors fly open. The Doctor throws a hand over his eyes as the blinding golden light of the time vortex pours out. In the doorway stands Rose. The Doctor stares, awestruck as the light curls around Rose when she steps forward. The Doctor stumbles backwards, falling to the ground. 
 THE DOCTOR   (scared):  What've you done? 
 Rose gazes down at him, her eyes full of the light of the time vortex. When she speaks, her London accent has vanished. 
 ROSE : I looked into the TARDIS. And the TARDIS looked into me. 
 THE DOCTOR : You looked into the Time Vortex, Rose, no one's meant to see that. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : This is the abomination! 
 DALEK 1 : Exterminate! 
 The Dalek fires at Rose, who holds up her hand. The bolt freezes and reverses back into the gun. The Doctor looks at it in amazement. He stares up at Rose intensely. 
 ROSE : I am the Bad Wolf. I create myself. I take the words... 
 The words "BAD WOLF CORPORATION" written high on the wall. Rose waves her hand. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I scatter them in time and space. 
 The words "Bad Wolf" rise from the wall and float away. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : A message to lead myself here. 
 THE DOCTOR   (urgently):  Rose, you've got to stop this. You've got to stop this now. 
 Rose stares straight ahead as though she hasn't heard him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (wildly concerned)  :  You've got the entire vortex running through your head. You're gonna burn. 
 ROSE   (suddenly looking at him):  I want you safe. 
 The Doctor is taken aback. He stares. Rose has the traces of tears on her cheeks. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : My Doctor. Protected from the false God. 
 EMPEROR DALEK : You cannot hurt me. I am immortal. 
 ROSE : You are tiny. I can see the whole of time and space, every single atom of your existence, and I divide them. 
 She raises her hand. The Dalek in the centre is separated into golden, liquid-like particles. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Everything must come to dust... all things. Everything dies. 
 She looks to the side, and the Daleks lined up there are reduced to golden particles. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : The Time War ends. 
 EMPEROR DALEK   (voice rising in fear)  :  I will not die. I cannot die! 
 It screws up its eye. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The entire mother ship is reduced to the liquid-like golden particles, dissolving away into oblivion. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 Rose stands with her arms raised, staring straight ahead of her, shaking. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose, you've done it. Now stop. Just let go. 
 ROSE   (hushed, blissful):  How can I let go of this? I bring life... 
 INT. FLOOR 500, CORRIDOR 
 Jack suddenly takes a huge intake of breath as his eyes snap open... 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 THE DOCTOR   (terrified)  :  But this is wrong! You can't control life and death! 
 ROSE   (looks at him again):  But I can. The sun and the moon... the day and night.  (Voice trembles).  But why do they hurt...? 
 THE DOCTOR   (desperately):  The power's gonna kill you and it's myfault. 
 He lowers his head with anguish. 
 ROSE   (a tear falling):  I can see everything. 
 The Doctor raises his head again. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : All that is... all that was... all that ever could be. 
 The Doctor stands up abruptly, looking down at her as if suddenly, he understands. 
 THE DOCTOR : That's what I see. All the time. And doesn't it drive you mad? 
 ROSE   (scared):  My head... 
 THE DOCTOR : Come here. 
 ROSE : ... it's killing me... 
 THE DOCTOR   (taking her hands):  I think you need a Doctor. 
 And they step slowly around to face each other. The Doctor gazes into her eyes, and then gently, carefully, leans down and presses his lips against hers. As he kisses her, the Time Vortex flows out of her eyes and into his. They part slowly and they gaze at each other for a few more moments before Rose's eyes flutter closed and she falls into his arms, unconscious. He lays her carefully down on the floor and then stands up straight, facing the TARDIS calmly. He slowly exhales and the Time Vortex is expelled from his mouth and it streams back through the doors into the TARDIS. The doors close quietly, and the TARDIS looks completely normal once more. The Doctor opens his eyes and smiles softly to himself. He kneels down and leans over Rose, stroking her face and neck tenderly. 
 INT. FLOOR 500, CORRIDOR 
 Groaning and wincing, Jack stands. He staggers forward through the doorway. Jack spots a pile of dust on the floor, where one of the Daleks once stood. He stoops and runs his hand through it in confusion. Suddenly, he hears the sound of the TARDIS engines groaning to life. Jack runs through as fast as he can. 
 INT. FLOOR 500 
 He's too late. the TARDIS is fading away, leaving Jack stranded. He stares after it, hurt and confused. 
 EXT. TIME VORTEX 
 The TARDIS falls through the time vortex. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Inside the TARDIS, the Doctor is at the console, looking up at the rotor and the monitor. Rose, whom he has lain down on the grilling next to the console, stirs. She awakens, disorientated. 
 ROSE : What happened? 
 THE DOCTOR   (mildly surprised):  Don't you remember? 
 ROSE   (sitting up, very confused):  It's like... there was this singing... 
 THE DOCTOR   (cheerily)  :  That's right! I sang a song and the Daleks ran away. 
 ROSE   (struggling to remember)  :  I was at home... no, I wasn't, I was in the TARDIS, and... 
 Unseen by Rose, the Doctor glances down at his hand. The veins shimmer with a golden light for a moment, and then it's gone. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I can't remember anything else... 
 The Doctor looks around at her uneasily. She is shaking her head, completely oblivious, trying to remember. She notices him watching her. He smiles. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose Tyler.  (Small laugh).  I was gonna take you to so many places. Barcelona, not the city Barcelona, the planet. You'd love it. Fantastic place, they've got dogs with no noses. 
 He laughs at his own joke. Rose giggles, half rolling her eyes. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Imagine how many times a day you end up telling that joke, and it's stillfunny! 
 ROSE : Then, why can't we go? 
 THE DOCTOR : Maybe you will. And maybe I will. But not like this. 
 He does not elaborate, but goes back to looking at the monitor with a vague smile on his face. 
 ROSE   (standing):  You're not making sense! 
 THE DOCTOR : I might never make sense again! I might have two heads. Or no head! 
 He laughs. Rose nods with a bemused smile on her face. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Imagine me with no head! And don't say that's an improvement... 
 Rose grins, eyes twinkling. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : But it's a bit dodgy, this process. You never know what you're gonna end up with... 
 And suddenly, he is propelled backwards with a blast of golden light. He clutches his stomach as though he has been punched. Rose rushes forward, full of concern. 
 ROSE : Doctor! 
 THE DOCTOR   (urgently)  :  Stay away! 
 Rose stops, staring at him, eyes wide. The Doctor winces in pain. 
 ROSE : Doctor, tell me what's going on. 
 THE DOCTOR   (still trying to keep his tone light despite being in pain):  I absorbed all the energy of the Time Vortex, and no one's meant to do that! 
 He screws up his eyes in pain, Rose staring at him with concern. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (serious, now)  :  Every cell in my body's dying. 
 ROSE   (horrified):  Can't you dosomething? 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah, I'm doing it now! Time Lords have this little trick, it's... sort of a way of cheating death. Except...  (Looks into her eyes).  It means I'm gonna change. 
 Rose shakes her head slightly, not understanding. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : And I'm not gonna see you again. Not like this. Not with this daft old face.  (He laughs, not wanting to scare her).  And before I go... 
 ROSE   (cutting across him, upset):  Don't say that. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose... 
 She backs down, listening. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Before I go, I just wanna tell you, you were fantastic.  (Smiles at her, so proud).  Absolutely fantastic. 
 Rose looks back at him, unsmiling, still upset and not knowing what to make of this. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : And d'you know what? 
 Rose shakes her head. The Doctor grins. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : So was I. 
 And finally, Rose smiles, nodding. The Doctor smiles widely back at her for the last few moments before suddenly, he convulses and orange energy explodes from his skin, blasting out of the neck of his jumper, the sleeves of his jacket and the bottoms of his trousers. 
 Rose staggers backwards, shielding her eyes from the heat and light - but she cannot look away. She stares transfixed, as gradually, the Doctor's hair lengthens, his face changes... until the energy eventually dies away and a completely new man is stood before her, still wearing the old Doctor's clothes. 
 He looks slightly surprised for a moment, before turning to look at Rose. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Hello! Okay... oo. 
 He gulps. Rose stares at him with fascination as he runs a tongue over his teeth, brow furrowed. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : New teeth. That's weird. So, where was I? Oh, that's right Barcelona. 
 Rose just stares at him with undisguised shock. He grins.
