 Previously on Hannibal... 
 Special Agent Jack Crawford. 
 I head the behavioral science unit. 
 Will Graham. Works for the FBI but isn't FBI. 
 He catches insane men because he can think like them. 
 This is Dr. Lecter. 
 What you need is a way out of dark places when Jack sends you there. 
 Will is connecting murders that previously had no connections. 
 You catch these killers by getting into their heads. 
 But you also allow them into your own. 
 I hallucinated that I killed her, but it wasn't real. 
 Will Graham, you're under arrest for murder. 
 Whoever's doing this to me, they'll be close to you. 
 You have to be careful, Hannibal. 
 They're starting to see your pattern. 
 Jack Crawford's beliefs about you might unravel. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 (Both grunting) 
 (Jack yelling) 
 Oh! 
 Ah! 
 (Yelling) 
 ♪  
 (Classical piano music) 
 This course is called 
 Mukozuke - 
 seasonal sashimi, sea urchin, water clam, and squid. 
 What a beautiful presentation, doctor. 
 Kaiseki - 
 a Japanese art form that honors the taste and aesthetic of what we eat. 
 Well, I almost feel guilty about eating it. 
 I never feel guilty eating anything. 
 Mmm. 
 I can't quite place the fish. 
 He was a flounder. 
 I last prepared this meal for my aunt Murasaki, under similarly unfortunate circumstances. 
 Well, what circumstances were those? 
 A loss. 
 This is a loss. 
 Will is a loss and we're mourning a death. 
 Will's death is on me, not you. 
 It's on both of us. 
 I can't stop thinking that Will may be convicted of five murders while I am only maybe convicted of one. 
 Well, you're not on trial. 
 I will be - 
 in the halls of the FBI. And so will you. 
 I mean, according to Will Graham, this was all you. 
 Will was your bloodhound. You can't ignore where he points. 
 I'm not ignoring it. 
 You have to investigate me. It's in my best interest, and yours. 
 Yes, it is. 
 But I also can't ignore the fact that my bloodhound went mad before he pointed in your direction. 
 We can't define Will only by his maddest edges. 
 We can't define Will at all. 
 (Stag huffing) 
 (Stag huffing) 
 (Inaudible speaking) 
 What did you say? 
 I said, how does that make you feel? 
 Makes me feel... like... 
 I'm sitting in a dunking tank and you're lobbing softballs, hoping to make a splash, but you keep missing the target. 
 Fortunately, I have time for a few more lobs. 
 You are in my hospital. 
 You're my patient now, Will. 
 I'm not talking to you, Frederick. 
 (Sigh) 
 I want to talk to Dr. Lecter. 
 According to Dr. Bloom, you were warned against putting someone with Will Graham's issues into the field. 
 Yes. That's correct. 
 Were you aware that Dr. Bloom would be filing this report? 
 Yes. She told me what she was going to do. 
 Did you advise her against it? 
 I told her she should do whatever she felt was necessary. Evidently, she felt it was necessary to file the report. 
 These are allegations of misconduct. 
 It's damning stuff, Jack. 
 I never stated anywhere that this was misconduct. 
 In my opinion, it was a lapse in judgment. 
 A lapse in judgment is misconduct. 
 There'll be an internal investigation. 
 There should be. 
 A federal examiner is someone who arrives at a battlefield after the battle and bayonets the wounded. 
 You have wounded Agent Crawford. 
 Who do you think is gonna be getting the bayonet? 
 There is a general desire to see this go away quickly and quietly. 
 In light of that, Dr. Bloom, I would greatly appreciate it if you would recant your report. 
 No. Will Graham's life has been destroyed. 
 How that happened has to be a matter of record. 
 I'm sorry, Jack. 
 Dr. Bloom is not easily swayed. 
 This is going to get ugly. 
 It already has. 
 Was there a storm? 
 Ah, it looks like someone's blasting beaver dams again. 
 Aw, man. 
 It smells real bad down here! 
 Probably dead beavers! 
 (He shouts.) 
 Get me out of here! Ah! 
 Will Graham has asked to see me. 
 I would like to see him. 
 I continue to be curious about the way he thinks, despite all that's happened. 
 He's still influencing you. 
 Will Graham asking to see you betrays his clear intent to manipulate you. 
 And if I agree to see Will? 
 It betrays your clear intent to manipulate him. 
 I miss him. 
 You are obsessed with Will Graham. 
 I'm intrigued. 
 Obsessively. 
 And he will take advantage of that. 
 Will is my friend. 
 Why? 
 Why is he your friend? 
 He sees his own mentality as grotesque but useful. 
 Like a chair of antlers. 
 He can't repress who he is. 
 There's an honesty in that I admire. 
 I imagine there's an honesty in that you can relate to. 
 What can't you repress, Hannibal? 
 (Door buzzer) 
 (Door opening) 
 (Footsteps) 
 Hello, Will. 
 Dr. Lecter. 
 Lost in thought? 
 Not lost. 
 Not anymore. 
 (Will chuckles softly.) 
 I used to hear my thoughts inside my skull with the same, um... tone, timbre, accent, as if the words were coming out of my mouth. 
 And now? 
 Now... my inner voice sounds like you. 
 I can't get you out of my head. 
 Friendship can sometimes involve a breach of individual separateness. 
 You're not my friend. 
 The, uh, light from friendship won't reach us for a million years. That's how far away from friendship we are. 
 I imagine it's easier to believe I am responsible for those murders than it is to accept that you are. 
 Sure is. 
 Your inner voice can provide a method of taking control of your behavior, accepting responsibility for what you've done. 
 Giving your thoughts words encourages clarity. 
 Oh, I have clarity. 
 About you. 
 Our conversations, Will, were only ever about you opening your eyes to the truth of who you are. 
 What you did to me is in my head, and I will find it. 
 I'm going to remember, Dr. Lecter, and when I do, there will be a reckoning. 
 I have huge faith in you, Will. 
 I always have. 
 I'm amazed what falls off the best of us when moving through a room. 
 Lessons learned from cellular decay: 
 Enjoy the world while we have it and give a little bit back. 
 When possible, I try to leave an indelible mark wherever I go. 
 Hopefully not with your DNA. 
 How long will you have my suits? 
 You might want to think about supplementing your wardrobe. 
 I frequently do. 
 You know, this is just a formality. Nobody expects to find anything. 
 Except for maybe Will Graham. 
 He'll have to be disappointed. The beauty of what you do, Ms. Katz, is in its certainty. 
 It'll be your evidence that convicts Will. 
 Well, I found enough of it. 
 No need to infer or intuit or trust. 
 So much simpler than psychiatry. 
 Will is doing his best to understand where he is and why. 
 You were supposed to protect him. 
 From himself? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not mad at you - 
 not any more than I'm mad at myself. We all missed it, whatever it was - is. 
 We all are not suspects. 
 You're not a suspect; You're the new Will Graham. 
 Thank you for coming, Dr. Lecter. 
 Jack, what can I do for you? 
 I was hoping you would help me with a psychological profile. 
 (Man): We found another body. 
 (Camera click) 
 This way, doctor. 
 This is the fourth body we've recovered so far. There's at least one more down there. 
 How long have they been here? 
 Hard to say, but someone went through a lot of trouble to make sure that they were well preserved. 
 They've been coated in some kind of resin. 
 The big one was partially sealed, rotting from the inside out. 
 The other three look like they were embalmed. 
 (Jack): Whatever he's doing, he's still figuring out how to do it. 
 Were they injected with silicone? 
 They were injected with something. 
 Silicone? 
 A technique for making resin-coated models out of fish. 
 Helps the body retain shape in death. 
 He's making human models. 
 You make models of things that you want to keep; these were tossed in the river. 
 Maybe they were imperfect. 
 (Jack): These are his discards. 
 
 
 
 I'm giving you informed consent to discuss me as your patient. 
 With whom? 
 Jack Crawford. 
 Disclosure of patient information should be limited to the requirements of the situation. 
 What is the situation, Hannibal? 
 Will Graham made accusations. 
 Jack's only being thorough. 
 You're keeping Agent Crawford close. 
 We share an obsession. 
 I got to be Will Graham today. 
 I consulted at an FBI crime scene. 
 I stood in Will's shoes, looked through his eyes, and I saw death... how I imagined he would see it. 
 Why would you be inviting the scrutiny of the FBI? 
 I'm being as open and honest as I know how. 
 You maintain an air of transparency... while putting me in the position to lie for you. 
 Again. 
 You're not just lying for me. 
 How far will this flirtation with the FBI go? 
 It would seem Jack Crawford is less suspicious of me than you are. 
 Jack Crawford doesn't know what you're capable of. 
 Neither do you. 
 Come on! Come on! 
 (Dog barking) 
 Whoa! 
 (She laughs.) 
 (Will):  And how are the dogs? 
 (Alana): Good. Well, Winston keeps running away, but the others are adjusting. Where does Winston go? Home. Well, he's not gonna find me there. Not today. But maybe someday he might. With the right defense. I don't currently have legal representation. You keep firing your lawyers. No, they're the FBI's lawyers. Then I'll find you a lawyer who's not affiliated with the FBI. What defense do you think I have? Automatism. Allows a defendant to argue they shouldn't be held criminally liable for their actions due to unconsciousness. Unconsciousness? Will... your mind was on fire. You had no control of what you were doing, much less remember doing it. What if I could remember? What if I could remember how this was done to me? What if you could remember how you did it? You believe Hannibal. I believe the Will Graham standing in front of me now is incapable of that violence. I believe you lost your mind, and for periods of time, you weren't the Will Graham I know. I hear Hannibal's voice in the well of my mind. I hear him saying words that he's never said to me. It isn't my imagination. It's... it's something else. Have you ever helped a patient recover memories? (Metronome ticking) Close your eyes. (Whispering): Feel the happiness in your limbs. Imagine yourself in a safe... and relaxing place. Safe to relax completely. No matter how deeply you go... my voice will go with you. This... this isn't working. (Will panting) What did you see? Will, what did you see? Salted and ash-baked celeriac with foraged  sel fou. Frederick, you have tested me. ♪ (Classical piano music) It's rare that I cook a meatless meal. I lost a kidney; I have to watch my protein intake. You didn't lose it, Frederick; it was taken from you. I remain impressed with your recovery. One can grow to love beets. Alana Bloom was visiting with your former patient today. Will was never my patient. The irony is that he is my patient, but he refuses to speak to me. Makes me feel like I'm fumbling with his head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. Will is going to be a challenge for any psychiatrist. He is so lucid, so perceptive. He's trained in criminal psychology, and he is a mass murderer. He's a prize patient. Or should be. How was Dr. Bloom's visit? He asked her to hypnotize him so he could recover his memories. This is delicious. Was he successful? Only in playing Dr. Bloom. It's sad to see a brilliant psychiatrist fall for such hoary old chestnuts. She wants to believe him; I do too. You do realize you're his favorite topic of conversation. Hannibal, Hannibal, Hannibal. Not with me, of course, but with everyone else who will listen. He tells everyone that you are a monster. Well, in that case, you are dining with a psychopathic murderer, Frederick. (Man): You have nice skin. (Honking continuously) (Alarm chirps.) (Honking stops.) Dental medical records placed the six - all adults, both men and women, different ages, different ethnicities, all from different states; nothing in common except they all disappeared from their homes with their vehicles. And they all had large amounts of heroin in their systems. Enough to be the cause of death? And then some. What's this strange skin discoloration on these bodies? We found traces of BHT, which is a color preservative. He wants them to look alive. Shot them up with a little China white, injected them with preservatives, then filled the bodies with silicone so they don't emaciate, then he seals them with, like, a hard resin shell. What are these puncture wounds? Those are like eyelets. Um, something was threaded through. They were strung up, mounted, presented. So how's he choosing them? We got nothing. Appears to be random, but if this is the discard pile, I'm curious to know how many were keepers. All right, I want a list of any missing persons that disappeared along with their vehicles in the neighboring states. Got it? Got it. (Door buzzer) It's good to see you. Don't know how I feel about seeing you. I'll let you know when I do. Does Jack know you're here? No, but he shouldn't be surprised. I'm surprised. I'm...compartmentalizing. There are a lot of people missing. Ah. You have the file with you? Yes. And pictures? Yes. The first six bodies were found in the same place - dumped in a river, caught in a beaver dam. What's he do to 'em? He targets them, follows them home, abducts them, and preserves them. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you? I thought you would have some ideas. These are DMV pictures of people who are still missing under similar circumstances from three different states. Tell me what you see. It's a color palette. (Exhaling) (Person choking) (Will choking) (Choking) (Spitting) (Coughing) (Dog whining) Hi, Winston. Come here, boy. There you go. I suppose you blame me too, huh? Hello, Jack. You need to take better care of this dog. Mm. I feel horrible. I got all the dogs chipped, but at least they're not running away to anywhere I can't find 'em. He's just looking for Will. Hmm? Yeah. Isn't that why you're here? Listen, uh... I understand why you felt you had to file that report. You questioned my judgment when it needed to be questioned. Yes, it did. And it will help in Will's defense if it's in the record. Declaring Hannibal's guilt is more important to Will than establishing his own defense. Hannibal's not guilty. Neither is Will. But he's clinging to the hope Hannibal did this so he doesn't have to face what he did. Convince me he didn't know what he was doing. I would really like to be convinced, Alana. A psychopath wouldn't be so scared of the truth, Jack. Will's terrified, but that's not stopping him from trying to find it. Somebody's gotta find the truth, eh, Winston? If Will doesn't remember what he did... he'll never accept the truth. (Jack): Will? Will? Hey, Will. Hi, Jack. Where were you just now? Gone fishin'. What are you doing here? I needed to remind myself of who you once were. You know, that man whose classroom I walked into months ago. I remember that man. Memories are all I have. Imagine how nice it is to stumble on a new one. I was almost certain Hannibal Lecter did this to me. And it's a funny thing, doubt. I had nothing to prove to myself or... or anyone else that Hannibal was responsible - not even a memory. You have something now? You've recovered a memory? Yes. That's meaningless. Not to me. He did it so well. I... there... there wasn't an orgy of evidence. There was just enough to convince you. We investigated your claims about Dr. Lecter, Will - thoroughly. We went over every fiber of every stitch of clothing. We took his DNA. We took his fingerprints. We found nothing. You let the fox into the henhouse. You stood over Cassie Boyle's body in that field and you described yourself to me. No, I described Hannibal Lecter. I can't hear this anymore. I... I am not the intelligent psychopath you are looking for. Goodbye, Will. (Dejected sigh) You may not believe me now. You will. (Shuddering) (Grunting with effort) (Yelling) (Yelling) (Yelling) (Yelling)
