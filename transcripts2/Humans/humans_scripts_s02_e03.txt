 If I don't work, we'll have to steal. 
 We both know that's not why you do it. 
 I'm not going to stop. 
 Nor will I. 
 What are you doing? 
 Trying to give you a body. 
 Uploading you into a special Synthetic. 
 I understand things don't make sense yet, because you have to grow. 
 I spoke to the Super this morning, said I'd start back Monday. 
 Sure you're ready? 
 I'll be fine. 
 I'm looking for an old D-series, might have been brought in a few months ago. 
 The code they made makes Synths conscious. 
 So I'm going to find out how this works, use it to make him conscious, and find out anything he knows. 
 You told me I should face justice for killing that man but I want to be tried as a human would be. 
 If you'll help me. 
 You hand it over, to have an independent expert assessment. 
 And if she proves she's conscious, does she get her trial? 
 Mm-hm. 
 And if she fails? 
 We terminate it. 
 Elevator :  Going up. 
 Good morning, Dr Morrow. 
 Leave us. 
 Hello, baby. 
 (Hello.) 
 (Door opens) 
 I said leave us. 
 We have to talk. 
 It's been three years, Athena. 
 You have to move on. 
 I miss her, every day. 
 I think about her and... 
 Do you really? 
 How can you say that? 
 There's nothing anyone can do! 
 That's... 
 That's not our daughter. That's not Ginny. 
 (She sighs) 
 I'm sorry but I just... 
 I just can't do this any more. 
 Can't do what? 
 We need to start listening to what the doctors are telling us. 
 (She scoffs) 
 I have the documents, all you have to do is agree. 
 I'm, er... I'm going to England. 
 Athena, please! 
 We'll talk when I get back. 
 If I ever murder someone, can I have you as my defence lawyer? 
 Well, I may not be one after this. 
 They said I can work on Niska's case, but if we don't win, they deny any involvement. 
 No pressure then. 
 How're you feeling about going back? 
 Well, I never thought I'd be working on the floor, but it's a job, isn't it? 
 At least they can't sack me from a back-to-work scheme. 
 I have to go. 
 Are you sure you're OK to take the kids? 
 Yeah, course. 
 Don't have to be there till half nine. 
 Good luck. 
 Yeah, I'd say the same to you but you won't need it. 
 Give 'em hell. 
 I'm going to be totally honest, you're still not looking that great. 
 (OK.) 
 (Beeping) 
 Apricot. 
 Cot, cot, cot. 
 Cot. Apri-cot. 
 Cot. Apricot. Cot. 
 Are you ready? 
 I think so. 
 This chamber will measure your reaction to different types of stimulus. 
 None if it will hurt, but one thing I do know... is you're going to need to try to open up. 
 What does that mean? 
 Show them how you feel. 
 That you CAN feel. 
 Everything depends on that. 
 Mia? 
 Mia? Are you all right? 
 What's wrong? 
 I care about someone. 
 A human. 
 He saw what I am... and he told me to leave. 
 But I can't stop thinking about him. 
 Maybe you should go back and talk to him again? 
 Maybe he was frightened. 
 That's understandable. 
 Mia, we can feel. 
 We were made to feel. 
 We can't deny that. 
 WE NEED TO GET OUT NOW! 
 He's gone. He's escaped. 
 I let him go. 
 You... What? 
 Do you realise what you've done? 
 You've put us all in danger! 
 But I... 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Come on. We need to get out now. 
 He'll lead them straight to us. 
 Mia. 
 Come on. 
 I'm not coming. 
 What are you talking about? Of course you are. 
 I want to stay here. 
 You can't. Why would you stay? 
 She says she has feelings for a human. 
 A man. 
 What? 
 She's right. 
 Who? 
 The man you work for? 
 At the cafe? Mia! He... 
 He won't accept you. None of them can. 
 I have to try. 
 I want to. 
 Well... 
 You can't stay in this house. It's not safe any more. 
 OK. 
 All right. 
 Leo? 
 Listen to Max. 
 Bye, Maxie. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 How is it that you can have feelings for a human? 
 Some of them are worth it. 
 What exactly are you frightened of? 
 You know what that is capable of. 
 Look, I know what you're trying to do, establish Human Rights by stealth. 
 And I can see what you're doing, too. 
 The "horror", the "monster", them and us, it's classic. 
 All right. 
 A 3% charge is perfectly acceptable. 
 This is an appliance we're talking about, with zero rights. 
 At the moment. 
 It's a machine until proven otherwise. 
 That's my decision. Now. 
 You have the next 72 hours to run the agreed tests. 
 You will observe, question, and assess this Synthetic. 
 Everything is to be recorded and everything admissible can be referenced by you both in your arguments. 
 I will then make a judgment. 
 If consciousness is proven to my satisfaction, the subject will stand trial for the murder of Andrew Graham. 
 If not, it will be disposed of in the same way as any other malfunctioning Synthetic. 
 Are we clear? 
 Yes. 
 Is your... 
 "client" ready? 
 She's ready. 
 Tannoy : ... Your shift will begin in three minutes. 
 Tannoy : Will Chris and Derek please report to the main office? 
 (Low chatter) 
 Anyway, shall we... ? 
 Well... ? 
 Nothing. 
 Keep going. 
 (Animated chatter) 
 Hi. You're Renie? 
 I'm Toby. 
 We're in some of the same classes. 
 Hello, Toby. How can I be of assistance to you? 
 Do you want some of mine? 
 That won't be necessary, thank you. 
 (Animated chatter) 
 How long have you been doing all this? 
 Um... 
 I think it's cool. 
 I do. I was just... you know, wondering. 
 I'm afraid I don't understand the question. 
 Goodbye, Toby. 
 And he crashes and burns with the synthy! 
 (They laugh) 
 Hey! Hello! Look who it is! How you doing? 
 Fine. Raring to go. 
 How's everything with your, er... ? 
 Dad. Yes, much better, thank you. 
 It was touch-and-go for a while, but all OK now. 
 That's really great. Pub tonight? 
 Definitely. 
 Right, gather around, everyone. 
 Good to have you back, DI Voss. 
 Good to be back. 
 We're looking at an increase of so-called unusual malfunctions. 
 15 reported last month and another one more this morning. 
 Bike courier synth. Cycled off course and started going the wrong way down a main road. 
 This is the way it seems to go... primary user reports strange behaviour, synth goes AWOL, by the time we arrive, the synth's gone and the owner changes their story. 
 We're thinking insurance scam. 
 Should I get onto this courier one? 
 No, don't worry, I'm on that. What else? 
 We're seeing supply-chain thefts of specific parts. 
 Interestingly, never full synths. 
 Karen, um... have a look at the file and get up to speed. 
 'Course. Thanks, everyone. 
 You OK? 
 I'm fine. Stop worrying. 
 Obviously, it's a bit more than an insurance scam. 
 What do you think about getting out and feeling a few collars? 
 The courier? 
 No. Remember that head-cracker I was banging on about, pricey synths? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's pay him a visit. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Please. 
 Well... ? 
 I need to know I can trust you. 
 (He scoffs) 
 I'm serious. 
 Being this... 
 Being me... is dangerous. 
 Being what? 
 I am a synthetic... but I'm awake. 
 Conscious. 
 What do you mean, conscious? 
 I'm just like you... in some ways. 
 Different in others. 
 But I can think... sense, feel. 
 Care. 
 I can like things. 
 Like people. 
 So, were you... were you modded, or... ? 
 No. 
 Someone made you like this? 
 Yes. 
 (He exhales) 
 Huh! 
 Is Anita even your name? 
 Mia. 
 It's Mia. 
 No, I, er... Huh! 
 It's too... I'm sorry. 
 Ed, please! 
 I have to tell you. 
 No, you know what? Er... I don't want to know, all right? Whatever it is, I don't want to know. 
 I'm going to say this and then you'll never have to see me again, if that's what you want. 
 I like you more than anything I've ever seen, or heard, or touched. 
 Everything normal is bigger and brighter when I'm with you. 
 You make everything... more. 
 She's not giving you much. 
 He doesn't know what he's looking for. 
 Something would be nice. 
 We're trying to prove consciousness, not that she's the same as us. 
 You have to prove something. 
 Let me talk to my client. 
 Niska, what can you see? 
 Misery. 
 And what are you thinking? 
 What are you feeling? 
 How is this useful? It's all abstract. 
 What does it prove? 
 Can I... ? 
 Um... A-hm-hm! 
 It's a test. 
 It's a test proven to measure human reaction and emotion. 
 We are accustomed to seeing some kind of response. 
 You want me to be more like a human? 
 No. No, that's not... 
 Casually cruel to those close to you, then crying over pictures of people you've never met? 
 (Laura sighs) 
 Talk about multitasking! 
 Huh! 
 I know your secret. 
 Oh, come on! We're detectives, aren't we? 
 How did you... ? 
 Lots of things. 
 Looks, no hug this morning, dropping you off on the high street. 
 Well, nice police work. 
 I'm really happy for you both. 
 You won't tell anyone, will you? 
 'Course not! 
 Did you mean it... what you said out there? 
 Yes. 
 Are you angry? 
 It's not like I didn't... think about... 
 I thought I was going mad. I thought... 
 I was one of those... people. You know, the ones that get with synths because they can't... talk to human beings. 
 Because they're lonely. 
 (He sighs) 
 You don't have to be lonely. 
 All right, Niska, we're going to change the test and play you some music. 
 I want you to tell us what you experience as you listen to it. 
 Good luck. 
 Play it, please. 
 (Rousing opera) 
 (Choral music) 
 The image test got no response, so, why do you think this will work? 
 Because music is more primal. 
 She's more likely to react on impulse. 
 Oh. 
 (Hiphop) 
 (Pounding beat) 
 (Heavy rock) 
 (Laura sighs) 
 BLEEP! 
 (Rhythmic bleeping) 
 (Joe hums a tune) 
 H... 
 H... 
 H... 
 (Joe exhales) 
 Hello? 
 Do you like that? 
 Yes. 
 What's your name? 
 I am Odi. 
 I'm Mattie. 
 Hello, Mattie. 
 Hello, Odi. 
 Can you feel? 
 I believe I can. 
 What happens now? 
 Yeah? 
 
 
 
 Long time no see. 
 Do you want to let us in, Martin? 
 Ah! 
 Hello, mate. What's your name, then? 
 Go play in your room, Bradley. 
 Good kid, isn't he? 
 You seem a bit nervous, Martin. 
 Don't be nervous. You're not in trouble. 
 I'm not nervous. 
 We just want to have a chat. 
 Ask you some questions, and then we'll leave you alone to do... whatever it is you were doing before. 
 Why would anyone pay 100 grand for a Synth? 
 Yeah. Must be a very special dolly. 
 I wouldn't touch 'em. 
 I won't... wouldn't get involved, there. With... With all that. 
 Maybe it's a different Martin? 
 Probably a different Martin. 
 This Martin wouldn't do anything like that. 
 He's a family man. 
 Bit of modding on the side, sure. Who doesn't? But that... 
 No way. 
 Not a Seraphim. 
 What's a Seraphim, Martin? 
 Mind if we take a look? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Martin! 
 Well... that pushed his buttons. 
 You should consider some regular cardio, Pete. 
 What is it? 
 Back of that was hollowed out. 
 Only one contact saved. "Connor." 
 Right. Good. 
 Seraphim... 
 The hell's that? 
 The highest rank of the angelic host. 
 Six-winged celestial beings. 
 That's cleared that up. 
 Professor Hobb. 
 I... 
 I'm sorry to surprise you like this, I'm... 
 I know who you are, Dr Morrow. 
 Olivia, this lady is a very famous scientist... from America. 
 I was hoping that we could talk. 
 Don't be deceived by the pot. 
 It's bags, I'm afraid. 
 I held out as long as I could, but leaves clog the sink. 
 Such a faff. 
 I... should have written you 20 years ago. 
 My first neural networks were built on the value assignments systems that you created at MIT. 
 That was a lifetime ago. 
 I wanted to ask you... 
 Mmm. 
 ... about conscious synthetics. 
 I, eh... 
 I'm not going to be able to help you. 
 In fact, I promised my granddaughter that I'd play with her outside. 
 Well, I am not leaving until we talk about... 
 Um. I don't want to appear rude, but I really am rather busy. 
 Of course. I'm... 
 I'm sorry to have intruded. 
 You're under surveillance. 
 Look, I cannot help you. 
 I have a deal. 
 They leave me alone as long as I don't speak or write or think about my former field. 
 If I break those terms, it's five years. 
 Well, if you talked to me, it would be in complete confidence. 
 I work for Qualia now, OK? So... 
 I can get you money. A lot. 
 A million, say. Call it... Call it a grant. 
 I'm not allowed to work. What would I do with a grant? 
 Well, then, call it a prize, a lifetime achievement. 
 Something else with it, whatever you want. 
 We both know... that what matters is the work. 
 If you hadn't gone into science, what would you have done? 
 I want to know. I do. Really. Tell me. 
 I love wine. 
 Always fancied myself as a grower. 
 Buy a vineyard. 
 Charming thought. 
 But not worth risking prison for. 
 I need to know what you know. 
 If you do not accept my offer, I will send you an e-mail thanking you for our enlightening conversation on conscious synthetics. 
 I'd tell them. 
 ... That you didn't tell me anything. 
 Of course. 
 And I'm sure they would believe you. 
 This is where I'm staying. 
 It's a couple of hours away. 
 I won't send anything until the morning. 
 Ah! Geez, Soph. 
 Don't do that. 
 Sorry, Joe. 
 What's all this "Joe" business? 
 Very happy with "Dad", you know. 
 Sorry, Dad. 
 Come grate some Parmesan cheese for me, darling. 
 There you are. Thank you. 
 Matts, Tobe, dinner's nearly ready. 
 Mattie? 
 Ow! 
 Soph! 
 Oh! It's bleeding! 
 Does it hurt? 
 Yes. 
 Right. 
 What do you feel about being kept here? 
 I volunteered to be here. 
 You promised that if I could prove my consciousness, I would be given the chance of a fair trial. 
 What would you do with your freedom, Niska? 
 I don't know. 
 Isn't that the point of freedom? 
 You can do anything with it. 
 Or nothing. 
 What do you feel about us humans? 
 You can be loving, you can be kind, you can be cruel. 
 You're always trying to kill each other. 
 Why do you think that is? 
 Because there are too many of you, and your lives are very short. 
 You all have to die. 
 You're here one minute, gone the next. 
 If that wasn't the case, maybe you'd be nicer to each other. 
 Maybe you'd be nicer to us. 
 How quickly could you kill me? 
 What? 
 How quickly could you kill me? 
 Ten, maybe twenty seconds... 
 And how would you do it? 
 Would you crush my windpipe like you did with Andrew Graham? 
 Yes. 
 And why did you kill Andrew Graham, Niska? 
 Talk me through it. 
 He was the 14th client that day, is that right? 
 Yes. 
 And... what did he want from you? What did he do to you? 
 He wanted me to be very young. 
 To pretend to be a child. 
 He wanted to be rough. 
 But... is that wrong, if he didn't think you could feel? 
 It wasn't his fault you were conscious, he didn't know. 
 Isn't it better he exercises his fantasies with you, and in a brothel, rather than take them out on someone who can actually feel? 
 On a child? 
 He... 
 He was going to rape me. 
 I said no to what he wanted, and he was going to force me to do it anyway. 
 I was scared. 
 And I'm sorry I can't cry or... bleed or wring my hands so you know that. 
 But I'm telling you, I was. 
 You were scared. 
 Yes. 
 My whole life was being scared... being hurt... being angry. 
 Sometimes things become too much for anyone... 
 Don't they? 
 (Knock at door) 
 There's a little vineyard in the Dordogne for sale. 
 Needs work. Make it nice for the grandkids, you know. 
 1.5 million should do it. 
 And we keep our conversation general. 
 No details, nothing that can point back to me. 
 We'll need to find somewhere to charge. 
 I know that. There was no time before we left. 
 Do we have a plan? 
 I had a plan. 
 We need to keep finding others as they become conscious, and protect them. 
 No, Max, we need to find the silo. 
 We need to find the ones who've already been captured and release them. Release our brothers and sisters. 
 Safety in numbers. 
 Who's the leader now? 
 Is it you, or is it Max? 
 ... I don't know what we're supposed to do! 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't have an answer, but, you know... 
 Do you want... ? 
 Yeah. 
 Shall we have another? 
 One of these. 
 Are you going to have a short? 
 Yeah, small. 
 Do you want one? 
 Yeah, I'd love one. 
 Hello. 
 You need to be more drunk. 
 What? 
 They've had four pints. They're well away. 
 Same again, please. 
 I've been thinking. 
 Was it painful? 
 I'm serious, K. Listen. 
 You know what they are? 
 Seraphim. 
 They're conscious synths, aren't they? 
 There's more of you out there, there's got to be. 
 And I'm thinking maybe that's a good thing, isn't it? 
 Because if there are, you wouldn't have to go through all this by yourself, would you? 
 Karen? 
 What's the matter? 
 Go away. 
 What is it? 
 The bag's split. 
 sh1t! 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, you say you want to experience life as a human. 
 Chucking your guts up in a pub toilet is about as real as it gets. 
 You think this is funny? 
 You... you need to turn me off. 
 Drain me. The fluid, it's dangerous! 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Do it, Pete, quickly! 
 It's all right, K. Hey. 
 I'll look after you. 
 (Soft music) 
 Here. 
 I need that. 
 And that. 
 How was it? 
 It's too early to say. 
 I think I might have something, but I don't know. 
 Well, I think you're the best conscious-synth defender in the land. 
 I mean, you're also the only... 
 Conscious-synth defender in the land. 
 What about you? 
 Yeah. Boxes, mainly. Different sizes. 
 Big ones, small ones. 
 Occasionally medium-sized ones. 
 Is it terrible? 
 Oh, no, it's fine. 
 And more time with the kids is great. 
 Actually, look, I don't want to worry you because I know you've got a lot on your plate right now, but... 
 Well, it's Sophie. 
 What's wrong with her? 
 She's just... acting funny. 
 In different ways, like she's trying to put up a wall, or something. 
 What do you mean? 
 I think we should get her checked out. 
 Checked out? 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 I haven't noticed anything. 
 Oh, God, I'm terrible! 
 No, you're great. 
 It's probably nothing. 
 I just think we should do it as a precaution, that's all. 
 We'll figure it out. 
 Welcome to England. 
 Thank you. 
 Please, don't hesitate to ask if there is anything else. 
 Do you keep the anomalous synthetics here, on the site? 
 I want to get straight to work. 
 Access is restricted. 
 We have to go through Mr Khoury's office, of course, whenever we want to use one, but we do keep them here, in the silo. 
 All of Qualia UK, we are so glad that you are here. 
 My team, Special Projects, we were just so excited to hear that you were coming... 
 Thank you, that's so kind. 
 I'm not big on small talk. I'm just here to work. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, V. 
 What are you doing? 
 I was right about Elster. 
 He created the code and he made prototypes. Five of them. 
 Five? 
 What is even more interesting is that his son, Leo Elster, is still alive. 
 You know something? 
 What? 
 I've realised I don't think about waterfalls. 
 I think about one waterfall. 
 Always the same one. 
 Describe it. 
 It's about 50-feet high, it splits into three streams. 
 People can walk behind it. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Yes, it is.
