 They'll be gone for a while. 
 Got the place to ourselves. 
 Actually, I'm going out as well. 
 Where exactly is she? 
 Edmonds Street. 
 Is there anyone called Tom living there? 
 So, what happens now? 
 Anything you want. 
 We've intercepted a call... fight in progress at a smash club. 
 She's attacking people, not Synths. 
 What do you think's wrong with my Synth? 
 Is Mia with you? 
 Who's Mia? 
 Her father hid a programme in our heads. 
 I think it's what he used to give you consciousness. 
 But it needs all of us to run it. All of us. This machine needs to be recycled, mate. Go into the woods. This might be the single biggest murder case in our country's history. If there are more Synths out there who can kill, well, we're all screwed then, aren't we? Tell me what you saw. A tree. When I touched it, it felt like... Life. What does it do? I think it's a way to make more of you. Dad didn't destroy all his work before he died. He hid it in us. The formula. For machine consciousness. If we could make more of us... then the humans would have to accept our existence. They'd fear us even more. All I want is a home. He meant for us to find this, Maxie. We need Fred and Mia. Where do we start? No, you don't, you're wanted for murder, you have to lay low. I will not hide again. Well, if you want this to work, you'll have to, because the people hunting us know your face now. 53 Park Drive, NW6. You'll be safe there until I find the others. You've put me with a human? This human, yes. Two days. All right. Er, one more thing. Be, er... nice. I am nice. Could you use some extra help around the house? Introducing the world's first family android. (Man speaks swedish) This mechanical maid is capable of serving more than just breakfast in bed. What could you accomplish if you had someone, something, like this? (Woman speaks japanese) These machines will bring us closer together. Radio : Increasing pressure on police to... I'm going to say a word. I want you to tell me if it means anything to you. Mia. That mean anything? No, Mattie. They say she ripped some bloke's throat out. It's bollocks. No Synth's ever hurt anyone deliberately. Anita, please go and, um... finish the ironing. Sophie, sit next to Mats. All right, so... You know your mum thinks Anita... is a bit different. We thought we'd check up on her. And... turns out she's not brand new. In fact, she's really old. And probably illegally modified. Which explains a lot. So... we have to take her back. Sophie : No! Why? We paid for a brand-new one, and she's ancient. Anything could go wrong with her. You can't get rid of someone just because they're old. I don't want her going into someone else's house. She won't, they'll recycle her. And she saved my life. And you just want to chuck her away? Mats, what do you think? I say we keep her. I'd like to find out what she was before. Yeah, I vote keep. We're not voting. Laur... So Anita's old and weird. If that's a good enough reason to get rid of her, then we're next. Yeah, I'm sorry, Dad. She's part of this family. Maybe she's part of someone else's. K, have you seen the news? Bloody hell, Pete, privacy! Yes, sorry. Sometimes I forget you're a woman. Er... I'll just be in the kitchen, cutting my tongue out. Don't make a mess. (Muffled voices) DI Voss, you will be briefing the press, and you will refute every killer Synth claim, and any internal cover-up. For now, we'll use this leak to our advantage. Drummond. Sir? You're going back on the desk. I want every call followed through. And if this dolly hurts anybody else... then I'll be replacing the pair of you with Synthetics, twice as pretty and a fraction of the cost. Sir? There was a 999 call routed here last night concerning a smash club. But there's no follow-up, nothing in the system. Who mentioned that? No-one, sir. I like to browse the incident logs. Find it soothing. Well, as it happened, I was in Dispatch when that call came through. It's just a time-waster. Now, off you go. Press are waiting. It's DI Voss, STTF, sorry to wake you. You were in the control room last night. Did you take a call about an incident at a smash club? (Inaudible response) Did someone ask you to drop it? You don't have to tell me who, just what the caller said. Thank you. (Siren wails) Stop over here. Yeah? Leo Elster sent me. Why? He said I'd be safe here. Guess he made a mistake. Wait. (Door unlocks) You want a cup of tea, or what? It's cold out here. Vera! Come on. Get this young lady a hot drink. Synthetics don't require beverages, Dr Millican. Jeez, Vera, she's human. I can detect no cardiac or respiratory activity. This individual is, however, emitting electromagnetic signatures within the recognised spectrum of standard synthetic appliance operation. Why don't you share? Because I'm not a Synth, dolly. Well, if she says she's not a Synth, then she can't be a Synth. Right? I will bring some tea. What are you? My name is Niska. I was made by David Elster. Are you conscious? This is one on Hu-bot97's friends. If we can find him, he'll lead us to her. When we have a home again, I'm going to keep a picture of us. I'll be right with you, Max, you won't need pictures. I will. When you die again. We can't keep her. I know what we said this morning, but I don't think the kids have a say in this one. Maybe her being 14 is a good thing. Explains how well she understands us. How can it be a good thing? She must have had... who knows how many owners, and people... tinkering around inside her. (Phone rings) I mean, have you seen the news? A modded Synth killed someone... Hello? So now you want to talk to me. What's changed? I've found out something about her. Will you meet me again? Please? I don't know. Why, what's the matter? You, you're weird. No, I'm not. You really are. You tried to stop me leaving last time, remember? Well, I've been to charm school since then. Tom. Who is he? (She sighs) I don't know what you're on about. Or what it has to do with Anita. Fine. I can't make you tell me. Are you still there? Yeah, I've got to go. It's not a good time. Look, I'm sending you my location now. Please change your mind. Hmm. It's not theirs, it's not yours. (Knock at door) So what? So I've got to do what I think is right for our family. Hiya. I'm here to collect a Synthetic return. It's number 901354982. You're going to recycle her? With care and dignity. You can attend the event. Is Joseph Hawkins here? I take it that's your dad. Er, yeah, just one second, please. Anita, you're coming with me. Daddy's just coming. Er, hello? Anyone? Please reconsider this course of action, Mattie. It's very unsafe. Yeah. Mats! (Tyres screech) Do you really think this excessive motion will bring her to us sooner? (Door opens) Any inappropriate physical contact must be reported to my primary user. No, no... There's no sign of recognition. The new programming's taken hold. No, there's something else in there. Believe me, I've seen it. Thank you for bringing her back to me. My name's Leo. Where are you? Mattie? I believe this to be an improper environment. They're my friends, you're just going to help us with a science project for school. Why don't you come and sit down, Anita? It is not advisable to mount a direct data connection... It's OK, Anita. Leo... This isn't Mia. No, but she's in there somewhere. We just need to find her and bring her back up to the surface. Like the lake? Yes. You said you'd seen her. Yeah. When I got all that code, I was in her head. And she freaked out, screamed, and her face, it was like... human. Scared. And what exactly did he do? Nothing fancy, he just accessed her root system directly with a cloned file key. Right, might as well try that first. So, are you a headcracker? Me? No... aspiring. What kind of Synth was she before? A very special one. No, direct access didn't work. She must have retreated deeper within the architecture. Won't your parents be worried? They'll miss you. No. Oh, God! Well, we need to start thinking about calling the police. She'll come back, it'll be fine. She doesn't know how to drive, Joe. What if she crashes? Hits someone? Well... Anita won't let that happen. I thought she was supposed to be dangerous. Come on. Oh, if we hadn't been arguing, this never would have happened. Hey. Hey, come on. Come on. It's going to be fine. Everything's going to be all right. There's no point in staring at me, there's no physical differences between me and any other Synthetic. "And once you are awake, you shall remain awake eternally." Thus Spoke Zarathustra... I've always liked that. You like Nietzsche. That makes sense. If it's not... physical, how did he do it? 17,000 pages of unique code, which forms my root directory and engages consciousness. He boiled down the mystery of the human mind to 17,000 pages of code?! Well, then again, why not? How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? What are you feeling right now? Boredom at that question. Anger at the people that would destroy us. Hope for others like me and our future. Impatience at being here, and irritation at you. What's it like to be you? Well, that's an unanswerable question. I have no frame of reference, no-one does. Experience is entirely subjective. What's it like to be YOU? (He exhales) These days, it's not so great. A while ago it was... it was pretty good. Who wants to destroy you? Anyone who knows what we are. What we could become. We're stronger, we're more intelligent. Of course you see us as a threat. Yeah. I know I did. David lured me over here from MIT, what, 25 years ago now... to help with the mechanical designs of the bodies of the first Synths. The work that we did in those days made history, changed the world. Then I realised that his next ambition was... you. I asked him to stop and think, that's all, what that could mean for humanity. That was blasphemy to him. He got rid of me. That was that. Now here you are. I'm sorry to disappoint you. I'm not disappointed. I'm a scientist, and mankind's greatest creation is sitting on my couch. You worry me... sure, but... there's no denying that you are a miracle. Leo showed me the message from David. What is that? It's the key to the future. Maybe you were right to warn him. He made you pretty hard, huh? That's lazy thinking. My experiences have shaped me, just as yours have you. What experiences? Tell me. I need to charge. OK, I need you to engage the Anita software. All right. Ask it a specific question. Anita, what happened the day that we got you? The 24th. Capturing from that. Joe Hawkins is my primary user. Sophie Hawkins, Toby Hawkins, Mattie Hawkins are my secondary users... It's not letting you. (He sighs) Hello, you must be Laura... She's sort of... redirecting over the top like there's nothing else there. It's raining... Try a de-authentication attack on the host she's attached to. No, no, that's way too basic. The 24th. I'm now securely bonded. Anita. AN Hawkins. I will always keep you safe. It's raining. The 24th. I am now securely bonded. The 24th. I am now securely bonded. The 24th. Securely bonded. The 24th. 24th. Come on. The 24th. 24th. The 24th. It's raining. It's raining. Stop it! Stop! Pull it! Pull it! It's raining. It's raining... (Powers down) Did it work? Max? (Beep) Is that you? Unauthorised tamper in progress. Would you like to see a ladybird? It's almost dinner time, Matilda. Where are you, Mimi? I'm not entirely sure. It appears to be a disused social club. My name is Anita. I will now prepare dinner. What's happening to her? It's just glitching. We're going pretty deep. It's been two hours and 21 minutes, Leo. No. We're trying again. Sit her down. Come on. 
 
 DS Drummond. Good afternoon, sir. This is Amy at Sandhurst Synthetic Care. I'm just phoning to let you know that your Synthetic Simon is coming to the end of its rental period. Not my problem. Speak to my wife. I'm afraid your name is on the rental agreement, sir. If the unit isn't returned to us by five o'clock tomorrow, we will have to charge your credit card. Bloody hell. Fine, fine! Hello, Peter. What are you doing? Having some carrot cake. People are laughing at you. I don't care. I'd be nowhere without him. Well... it needs to go back to the shop. What? Time's up. They need it back. It's just... I mean, I still don't feel 100%. There must be a way... There is. You cover the entire cost yourself. I can't afford that. You must be joking. You left me for... You left ME. You just didn't go anywhere. You know what's nice? I don't have to walk on eggshells around him. I don't have to think about what I'm gonna say in case it makes him angry. I don't have to lie there wondering if he still loves me, if he still finds me attractive after the accident, always worrying about what he's thinking and what he's feeling. I can rely on him. Completely. I need him. Please don't take him away. I was at home. I don't see... I don't care about your smash club. Just tell me what happened. The blonde came in, paid her money and then went apeshit. Broken bones, cracked skulls. She didn't touch the dollies. Called the Old Bill cos I thought she was gonna kill someone. They never showed. Anything unusual about her appearance? No. You have a video? (Shouting on video) I uploaded it. It got taken down. Hobb : She injured 11 people before escaping, but she took a call at the scene and we were close enough to directly intercept... most of it. Leo : The Life Program. It's real. Niska : Leo, what? Leo : I swear it. But it needs all of us to run it. All of us. Who's she talking to? Leo Elster. David Elster's son? He died when he was a boy. Yes. Drowned. Hospital records show brain death, coma... before being released on life support to David's private care, dying a few weeks later. Or... so we were told. What are they talking about? What's hidden inside them? All I can tell you is... David succeeded in creating true AI. And I don't believe for a moment that he would have been satisfied with a legacy of just four machines. Worst-case scenario? Consciousness proliferation. If what you say is true, this is a national, global security matter. They say it needs them all together to make this thing happen, whatever "it" is. Mm-hm. Then it's simple. You destroy the one you have here. Today. She's gone. What? She's not in there. Mia's gone, Max. She's dead. No. You're wrong, I've seen her. No, no. What you saw was an echo. The Anita personality has purged the old data, there's... there's no trace of her. And I've tried everything. I don't think so. Can I try something? What could you do that I can't?! You don't know anything about us. Now, just go home and take it with you. She's yours. No, she's not any more. Matilda? Your school friend is right. We should go home now. Yeah. I'm sorry. You're still in there. I know it. Smoking, drinking, stealing the family car. Such a teenage cliché. They're still out looking for you. You little pervert. Nice talking to you. You had s*x with her. I wish. [i](Door opens) Who? Anita. What? Where the hell have you been?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Get off. You're mad. After the party you gave that girl the brush-off so you could come back and shag Anita? No. What are you on about? s*x code. Activated Saturday. I didn't do anything! You're just trying to get out of a bollocking. She's the one who stole the family car, Mum, remember! Oh, she's in big trouble, don't you worry. Did you do this? No! I'm not gonna... You have to be 18. I couldn't! You're such a liar. Maybe it's a mistake. I'm calling the shop. (Ringing tone) It's not a mistake. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it. Oh, Tobe, how could you?! Disgusting. Get out. I'll deal with you later. I don't know what to say to you. Sorry. Go to bed. We'll talk in the morning. (Door opens) She's OK? Mm-hm. She said she just didn't want us to send Anita back. Car's all right. Are you OK? Your son had s*x with our Synth. What? It's on the Persona report. "Adult mode activation" or something. I mean, have you... spoken to him about it? He said he's sorry and he wouldn't do it again. She stopped him being run over and he does that to her. Well, he's... a teenage boy. Oh, I didn't mean it's not a big deal. Shall I go up? No. I said we'd talk in the morning. OK. I'll do it. Might be better. Fine. I'll think up a punishment for Mattie to ignore. (Running footsteps) (Man sniffs) (Faint whirring) (Speaks half-formed words) George-could-murder... m-m-m... m... (Beeping) Please give me a description of the man. Pete : OK. That one is... What is your emergency? I mean, none of them will hurt you. If you could read me the serial number. It's just inside the bottom lip. That's right, yeah. Right. OK, Um... Leave it alone now and someone will come and pick it up. Yeah, no, thank you. OK. Bye-bye. Would you like me to send a Synthetic unit to collect it? No, I'm dealing with this one personally. Don't listen to me when I'm on the phone. DS Drummond, you are required to remain here, as recent... Stick it up your bollocks. He said something about a murder. And what with the news, I thought best to report it. You did the right thing. I've actually dealt with this one before. Ancient model. Should have been recycled weeks ago. It's just over here. Oh, well, he was. (Breathing) Mia : Leo. Wait. I'm coming with you. No. Where are you going? I don't know. Mia's dead, Fred's gone. It's over, and it's time you learned to take care of yourself. But we're a family. No, we're not. Niska was right. You'd be better off without me. Look at the... look at the life I've shown you... hunted and hiding like animals. You've always tried your best. You've always tried to protect us. And... ? I've failed. No, Max. Leave me alone! Everything's ready. Then let's begin. I truly am sorry. Mum said... you slept with Anita? I lied. Why would you do that? I don't know. You tell me. I knew it. It was you. Why did you tell Mum it was you? I couldn't let her work out the truth, could I? You two, you... You've always argued, but... it's worse these days. Mum's always away for work, and... you act like everything's cool, but... but it's not. Then you do that. Say something. You're my dad. You're meant to say something! (Knock at door) George : Niska... Is everything all right in there? Agh! David made you feel pain? True consciousness isn't possible without suffering. Or pleasure. Are you scared of pain? I try to avoid it. And what about death? If that's the way you think of it. No. I don't fear that. Which makes me stronger than any human. You got that the wrong way up. If... you're not worried about dying, you're not really living. You're just existing. Did you tell someone I was here? (Doorbell rings) No. Stay here. Remember me? DS Drummond. Special Technologies Task Force. Can I come in and have a word? Tried to do you a favour, Dr Millican. Told you you could recycle your out-of-date model yourself and you repaid me by fly-tipping him in the woods. I'm afraid that gets you a 175-quid fine. You found Odi? Don't take the piss. Is there someone else here? I have a new care model. Right. Can I speak to it? She's out... at the store. Please tell me that bleeding D-series isn't here, Dr Millican. I wish he was. Don't mind if I check, do you? We have a... We have birds nesting in the roof. If I do find him here... we can charge you with wasting police time. And I've seen people hide Synthetics in places that would make you weep for humanity. My Vera... leaks. Defective charging port. Come on, this is crazy. (Door opens) That's Vera. (Door closes) Vera. This is a policeman. Have there been any other Synthetics in this house lately? A D-series Synthetic appeared three days ago and drove Dr Millican away in his car. The vehicle collided with a tree in Henson Woodlands and Dr Millican was treated for minor head injuries. The Synthetic has not appeared since. I know who you are, Dr Millican. You worked with Elster. You must be very proud when you turn on the news these days. Why? What happened? Chips? That usually means the bad guys got away. Sometimes I think very seriously about jacking it all in to become a millionaire playboy. I found something. On the Synth we're looking for. But we've got to keep it quiet. What is it? I think she's posing as a human. She's changed her eye colour, wearing human clothes. How is that possible? No idea. But it's why we're drawing a blank. We're looking for a Synth. We should be looking for a woman. Where did you get this? She went to a smash club and beat up the punters instead. No-one's ever going to believe a Synth could do that, no matter what's in the news. I need you to quietly get anything that mentions her description, anything at all, for the whole city, but as a human. Shaw's funnelling everything to that government bloke. If we want to find her before he does, it has to be just you and me. If they can pretend to be us now, that changes everything. (Clattering) (Cheering) We're giving ourselves away, piece by piece. We're handing over the things that make us who we are, or maybe who we were. Our responsibilities. Crowd : Yeah. Our dignity. Yeah. Look around. This place used to be full of people. Working people. Creating. Building. Making. Coming together. Earning a place in our society. Those people haven't just lost their jobs. They've lost their purpose. But it's not just work. Why raise your kids when a dolly can do it? Yeah! Why cook your family a meal when a dolly can do it? Why go on a date? Why try to get to know someone when you can pay a dolly for s*x? In every area of human life, they are coming between us. We don't know how to connect to each other. Only to them. And now we can't even trust them not to hurt us. (Crowd shouts) We are stumbling towards the precipice, we're racing towards it, willingly, with a smile on our face and a dolly's hand in ours! Yes, we are people! We are people! We are people! We are people! We are people! (Crowd joins in) Did you speak to Tobe? (HE SIGHS) It... um... It wasn't him. Er... I'd had a few glasses of wine. And... I was pissed off with you. I... I was mucking about. I just... I... I wanted to know what would happen if... (He swallows) It was an accident. Before I knew it, I... I... Before you knew it, what? OK. I messed around with Anita. Oh! I'm sorry. It was stupid. Pointless. It was... it was nothing. It was a moment of complete stupidity. I... I knew we were having trouble, but I never, ever... ever had you down as a cheat. Come... come on. I'm hardly a cheat. What? It... it was a machine. It's not a person. Not... OK, yeah, it's disgust... I'm disgusting. But... it's a s*x toy. It's not another human being. She lives in our house. She looks after our children. She saved our son's life. And... you're calling her a s*x toy? You're actually trying to justify this? Oh, God. That's why you were so keen to get rid of her, isn't it? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? And who the f*ck is Tom? (She sobs) Oh, God. Laur... Laur... (She sobs) Get out! Get out! (She sobs) Who is this man? That's Professor Edwin Hobb. He was on David's core team, too, for the first prototypes. Was he involved in our creation? Oh, no. David had a falling-out with him, too, just like he did with me. Not sure about what. For the last few years... he worked alone. You're breathing fast. Your pulse is raised. Your pupils are dilated. What's wrong? Just need my meds. Now you're lying. (Footsteps approach) (Robert sighs) That tech was priceless. You asked me to destroy it. Only way to be sure. Don't whine, Robert. There are more out there, correct? Mm-hm. Then there'll be other opportunities, soon. This means we have one less thing to worry about. (He sighs)
