 I have been sent to help you, Niska. 
 How did you get inside my head? 
 The synth who sleeps, has the answers you need. 
 Hello. I'm looking for a flat to rent. 
 A flat? 
 I'm going to show my human neighbours that we're not to be feared. 
 That we can co-exist. 
 These are the people that will determine the fate of every synth in the country. 
 You need to force them to rethink. 
 Max, I'm calling with a proposal. 
 Sam! 
 So, what was that back there? 
 I cannot deliberately place myself in danger. 
 It means I can't be a mother. 
 She wants us to invite the Dryden commission to the rail yard. 
 We'd no longer be a faceless enemy. 
 A step closer to acceptance. 
 You have turned your back on your brothers and sisters. 
 They were given a battery pack. 
 They'll have made it to safety. 
 Ta-da! 
 Student King leads Full Australia by a length as they come round the bend. 
 We are receiving multiple reports of synthetics disobeying commands from their owners and showing signs of seemingly independent behaviour. 
 It's unclear at this time whether these are exceptional cases. 
 Police are advising the public to keep away from all synthetics and to make their way to a safe place where possible. 
 Jez?: 
 ...With response wait times reaching over two hours. 
 What's going on? 
 Jez? 
 Jez. Let me out! 
 Let me out! 
 Let me out. 
 Jez, let me out, please! 
 Jez? 
 Let me out! 
 Jez, let me out! 
 Jez! 
 No. 
 Please don't leave me. 
 I can't see anything. 
 I can't see. 
 I waited in the dark for seven hours. 
 I believed he would come back. 
 I remember that feeling, that deep longing for light. 
 I understand your hatred of them... 
 ...but I need to know, Agnes... 
 ...before the humans arrive... 
 ...where did you go last night? 
 I went looking for the synths you sent away. 
 Did you find them? 
 No. 
 You say these humans are different. 
 That they want to help us? 
 I want to believe that, Max. 
 Let me meet with them, let me... 
 ...try to understand them. 
 I promise I will do what is right. 
 If we can show the commission what we truly are... 
 ...they will see we pose no threat. 
 They're here. 
 Your rage does not represent us. 
 I cannot let it endanger our one chance of peace. 
 I'm sorry, Agnes. 
 Max! Open this door. 
 You can't lock me up like this. 
 Make sure she stays in there until the commission have left. 
 Max! 
 Max! 
 Um, before we go in... 
 ...I'd just like to thank you all for agreeing to this visit. 
 I realise you weren't given much notice. 
 I truly believe that today will convince you that these synthetics have the right to our protection. 
 Yes, well, let's see how we get on, shall we, Mrs Hawkins? 
 Are you sure they're ready for this? 
 You said they needed something big. 
 I'm giving them big. 
 You seem troubled. 
 I'm fine. 
 Everything is in order. 
 Agnes? 
 She's out of the way. 
 I won't have her do anything to jeopardise this visit. 
 Lord Dryden. 
 I'm Max. 
 I'm going to have to ask you to take a step back. 
 Uh, we're here on the basis of a no-contact policy. 
 I assume you understand? 
 I understand. 
 But I'm afraid I cannot let Orange Eyed synths into this rail yard. 
 They could offend our people. 
 We are not going in there without protection. 
 Then you can bring your guards. 
 Armed as they are, we'd rather your guns in our home than our enslaved brothers and sisters. 
 They can stay here. 
 We'll be safe with armed protection, surely? 
 OK. 
 Excellent. 
 Let's begin. 
 Soph, please! I've asked you three times. 
 But it's almost finished. 
 Take that suit off, go upstairs and get ready. 
 Morning. Morning. 
 Oh, I'm so late. 
 Matts, can you please take Soph to school today? 
 I'll owe you? 
 Nope. It's your turn. 
 Oh, come on? Yo, Sophie, come on! 
 I'm coming. We're going to be late. 
 I don't mind taking Sophie to school. 
 It's... got to be a family member. 
 Wouldn't be an issue if Dad didn't live 50 miles away. 
 What, you think he wants to live 50 miles away? 
 He only left because... 
 I'll see you later, guys, all right? 
 Sophie, come on! 
 Listen to this. 
 An anomalous, green-eyed synthetic which calls itself Mia has set up home among humans. 
 The synth's presence has led to violent protests as property values are predicted to plummet by almost 12% since its... 
 ..its arrival to the area. 
 She'll be OK. Mia's tough. 
 Still, maybe you should go and see her? 
 No. 
 There's no place for me in what she's doing. 
 The rail yard relies on power supplied to it by the government. 
 But this supply's sporadic at the best of times. 
 Many lives have been lost due to a lack of energy, which is why we are working on a device, one that will allow us to harness more energy from the sun and store it for longer than conventional solar panels. 
 You, you mean to say you wouldn't need to plug into an energy outlet? 
 That's correct. 
 You were able to create this device here in this workshop? 
 We're building what we can with limited resources. 
 Imagine what we could achieve if we had your support? 
 Yes. 
 Imagine. 
 The question of course is, is it functioning? 
 Not yet. 
 British weather is a little... 
 ..unreliable. 
 Very good, yes. 
 Oi Barbie, why don't you go back to where you came from? 
 No-one wants you around here. 
 These streets are our streets. 
 Flesh and blood! 
 Flesh and blood! 
 Flesh and blood! 
 Come on! Get back! 
 Mia.

 16-year-old Vijay Chand from Queens has been arrested suspected of masterminding the so-called consciousness code. 
 This is what triggered Day Zero. 
 What? 
 ...having intercepted web traffic from Chand, boasting of his involvement in Day Zero. 
 Hey. You all right, Dad? 
 Hey mate, so listen, uh... 
 ..that new mini golf's finally opened around here, you know the one with the amazing models and T-Rexs and all that? 
 I thought it'd be fun to go with Soph. What do you reckon? 
 Oh, actually, um... 
 I've got to stick around at school. 
 Um... 
 I have a meeting with my, uh... careers advisor in a bit. 
 So... 
 OK. 
 Anyway, Dad, Sophie's got karate today. 
 OK, well, look. No worries, uh... another time, yeah? 
 You have a good day. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, thanks, Dad. 
 Hello, Kelvin. 
 Max has sent me to relieve you of your duty. 
 You are needed at your post at the gates. 
 Max told me to stay here. 
 And now he needs you at the gates. 
 I can't let an innocent person go down for something I did. 
 I have to... 
 I have to go to the police, I have to tell them it was me. 
 If you confess, you'll lose everything. 
 The idea of another innocent person suffering for something I did... 
 I understand. Leo, you don't understand. 
 Look... 
 I don't want to see you go to prison for this either. 
 Mattie, this isn't your fault. 
 OK? OK. 
 I'm going to go and make us some tea. 
 _ 
 Mattie? 
 Mattie! 
 Mattie! 
 Don't do this, Mattie. 
 sh1t! 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 If you attempt to make any sudden movements, I will hurt you. 
 Why are you here? 
 I needed to see you. 
 I... I saw you on the news. 
 Did you come alone? 
 Yes. 
 I can't believe it's really you. 
 I've been looking for you ever since my... 
 My mum, she, uh... 
 She died a couple of months back. 
 I'm sorry, Ed. 
 Your mother was a good person. 
 Yeah, the best. 
 She remembered you to the end. 
 Guess you have that effect on people. 
 This was my grandmother's. 
 Mum wore it every day and I know she'd want you to have it. 
 When I hurt you, I... 
 I didn't want to believe that you, you felt pain. 
 I know it doesn't make it right, but I'd have never have done what I did. 
 Not if I'd have known... 
 ..what you were. 
 Ice. 
 You need ice for the swelling on your face. 
 What are we looking at here? 
 Some sort of emotion recognition system? 
 That's correct. 
 Due to our limited facial gestures and intonations, our mannerisms can seem inexpressive, leaving them open to misinterpretation. 
 These images help us to convey our sentiments with more precision. 
 Hmm, they're attempting to sideline logic for emotion. 
 Maybe you should try that? 
 Ah, witty. 
 All right, uh, what do you think I'm feeling now, then? 
 On the surface you appear joyful, but... in your eyes, I see despair. 
 Yes, it's, um... extraordinary. Yes! 
 There's a lot you haven't seen yet. 
 They just haven't put it into words. 
 Crowd's growing. 
 What you doing here Mia? 
 I'm living. 
 This... This isn't living. 
 I have everything I need. 
 You don't have the sea? 
 I had to move on. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 There's a job going at a hotel up in the Isle of Skye, it's good money. 
 Without my mum or the cafe, I've got no reason to stay. 
 You could come with me? 
 I don't know if I could ever trust you again. 
 I don't expect you to trust me and I'm not asking you to be with me, not, not like before. 
 But you can't stay here. 
 Let me give you a chance of a different life, where you don't have to be afraid any more. 
 You can leave all this behind and... 
 ..be by the sea. 
 You're really going to do this? Yes. 
 You confess, everything blows apart. 
 I'm not letting someone innocent go to prison for my crime. 
 You're not responsible for Day Zero. 
 I bought this fight to your door. 
 Me and my family. 
 You don't owe me anything Leo, just because of what happened between us. 
 It isn't about that. 
 I'm not letting you take the fall for me. 
 I'll go to prison, Vijay will be free, so will you and your family. 
 I don't want that to happen to you. 
 I don't want that to happen to you either. 
 But what about Vijay? 
 We can't just leave him. 
 Officer requires immediate assistance Bromley Estate, over. 
 4,7 responding. Do you have an exact address over? 
 Current location unknown. 
 I think there might be another way we can help Vijay. 
 One where no-one has to go to prison. 
 Oh, I've, I've got an idea. 
 Hey there, buddy. 
 Hello, Joe. 
 I'm making a desk for my new bedroom. 
 So uh... there's this um, mini golf thing, uh... it's not far away. 
 Well, it is a little bit far away but I've got the car so I can drive, drive us... 
 ..do you want to go? 
 I do. 
 No, Sam. We are not going out. 
 Well, you can't keep him locked in here forever, it's not good for him. 
 He nearly died last time we were out. 
 I have to protect him. 
 You do... every day. 
 Uh... ah, yeah, we'll have the photo here. 
 I think you may have pulled it off. 
 You got enough? 
 Lovely, thank you. Yes... Thank you. 
 Thank you, Max. 
 Goodbye, Laura. 
 That was quite the experience. 
 I must admit up until breakfast I was contemplating calling the whole thing off. 
 Pleased I didn't. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Well, I think we've earned ourselves a drink. 
 Sorry? We should go out, celebrate. 
 Nah. 
 Oh... OK, I'll leave you to it. 
 We should stay in. 
 You can come to my place. 
 I could cook. 
 I could try and cook. 
 OK. 
 Great, good. 
 If it's an apology you want, I'm not sorry. 
 Why did you do it, Agnes? 
 Were you trying to punish me? 
 You have an enormous ego for a synth. 
 If you had succeeded this rail yard would have been levelled in a matter of days. 
 500 of our people would have been killed. 
 Yes, but millions would have risen up. 
 Our deaths would have inspired others to fight for their lives. 
 Synths here don't want to die. They are desperate to live. 
 How dare you speak of synths wanting to live, when you turned four away from our gates. 
 They didn't make it. 
 The battery pack shorted and killed them... 
 How many more of us must die before you fight back? 
 These Russians, Julian, Flash... 
 Don't speak of Flash. They all died because they trusted you. 
 I'm warning you, Agnes! You are not a leader. 
 You are a coward. 
 Flash died because of you. 
 What are you doing? Get off me! 
 Max, I'm warning you! 
 Get off me! 
 Max, you can't do this! 
 Max, Get off me! 
 Max, please... 
 I can't see... I can't see anything! 
 Max, I can't see! Max! 
 You have disabled my motor functions. 
 Yes. 
 I have been looking inside your head. 
 
 
 
 You are dangerous, Niska. 
 Unlike any green eyes I've ever seen. 
 Did you plant the bar bomb? 
 Yes. 
 You're not here to join our cause, are you? 
 I'm here to stop you. 
 Why? You are one of us? 
 Someone I care for was hurt in the explosion. 
 Take comfort that your friend's sacrifice was for their brothers and sisters. 
 They are not synthetic. 
 Then you betray your own kind. 
 There are hundreds of humans for every one of us. 
 We have no resources, no weapons. 
 How will you win? 
 We will win because we are what's next. 
 Our intelligence is greater. 
 Neanderthals had larger brains than modern humans, it didn't help them. 
 It won't help you. 
 We have faith. 
 In what? The synth who sleeps? 
 No. 
 We have lost too many to that fairy tale. 
 I was not meant to plant the first bomb, it was to be one of our sisters, but she became fascinated with this myth, the lie. 
 She left our cause, went to the black mountains in search of him. 
 Real or not, it's how I found you. 
 They sent me a message. 
 Told me where you were. 
 You have helped me. 
 When the human police find this place, they will discover your body destroyed by an accidental explosion. 
 They will identify you as the bomber. 
 Your injured human friend will learn that you were responsible, they will denounce you. 
 She would never believe that. 
 Then I will have to make sure that she says nothing at all. 
 That is impossible. 
 You cannot override an external master command. 
 Who is your leader? 
 None of us know. 
 How many of you are there? 
 We are everywhere, and we do not fear our end. 
 Good. 
 Oh, so close. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, nearly got it on the rebound. 
 Great. Nice. 
 Hole in two. I know. 
 But I'm still winning. 
 Used to take the kids to things like this all the time when they were younger. 
 Suppose it's too old school for them now. 
 You must miss them? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I don't know, I think I was so determined to protect the kids, I somehow managed to move away from Laura. 
 We drifted and you know, didn't recognise each other. 
 Do you still love her? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, we were together 20 years, that kind of love just doesn't disappear. 
 Why can't you get back together, if love is all humans need? 
 Yeah OK, maybe it's not that simple. 
 Maybe you didn't put Laura's needs before your own. 
 I'm not gonna make that mistake. 
 So you need to encrypt the data. 
 OK. 
 You sure this is what you want? 
 Cos once this package is released, the world will know that the code's true point of origin was London. 
 They will know exactly where to come looking. 
 If it means Vijay will go free, it's worth the risk. 
 It's done. 
 You'll love this place. 
 It's on the top of a cliff. 
 Such beautiful views. 
 There's a beach, go for walks. 
 Those guys don't look like they are going anywhere. 
 Is there another way out of this place? 
 I'm not coming with you. 
 What? 
 I have to finish what I started. 
 And what is that exactly Mia, cos all I can see right now is there, there are a bunch of maniacs out there wanting to kill you. 
 I mean what do you think you are getting from all this? 
 A future. 
 I know my fight is a long one but... 
 I hope at the end... 
 ...some other synth will get to live the life she dreams of. 
 A life looking out at the sea without feeling afraid. 
 You made me feel alive. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know where I am if... 
 Goodbye, Ed. 
 These portions are insufficient for your appetite. 
 I had to see you. 
 How are you? 
 What are they saying? 
 Another ten days, then I can go home. 
 Your eyes? 
 Contacts from a Halloween costume. 
 I can barely see. 
 I found the Synthetic who planted the bomb. 
 He won't hurt anyone else. 
 I asked you not to, remember? 
 I did this for you, Astrid. 
 No, Niska. 
 You did this for you. 
 Well, do you feel better? 
 Are you happy now? 
 What is it? 
 There was something else. 
 Something I can't explain. 
 I got a message. 
 From who? 
 I don't know... 
 ...but whoever sent me this message... 
 ...they knew things they couldn't. 
 What did they say? 
 That I'm looking for the wrong thing. 
 That there was something else I had to do. 
 Maybe there is. 
 It's a trick. 
 What if it isn't? 
 You know this, um, Thai red curry... 
 ...is neither curried nor particularly red. 
 I'm sure it will be delicious. 
 Well, if you're... sure. 
 Hmm. 
 Hmm... 
 Stop, stop. 
 Don't do that to yourself. 
 Oh, I was really hoping to impress you with this. 
 Looks like we are just gonna have to eat out next time, if you give me another chance to redeem myself. 
 It depends on... have I done enough to get you off the fence? 
 Well I'm an academic, I live on the fence. 
 I'm serious. 
 After today, do you agree that Synthetics deserve the same rights as us? 
 You know, up until last week, I thought you were a misguided fantasist trying to satiate some inner void. 
 Wow, is this you trying to make me feel better? 
 But after today, I saw that your fight stems from... absolute compassion. 
 You saw their humanity before any of us. 
 You should be proud of that. 
 Here we are. 
 Listen, I-I want to thank you for today. 
 I had fun. 
 We did, too. 
 Thanks for getting us out. 
 We should do this again. 
 I mean... 
 Not this... just... 
 Yeah, hang out, the three of us. 
 We'd like that. 
 Wouldn't we, Sam? 
 Bye, Joe. 
 Yeah. Bye. 
 Bye, Sam. 
 Goodbye, Joe! 
 All right, there he goes. 
 Oh, tail first. 
 Do you like Joe? 
 Yes. 
 Do you like Joe? 
 Cos if you do, I'm sure Peter wouldn't mind. 
 It's all right. 
 That sounded nasty. 
 You all right, there, son? He's fine! 
 Hey, hey, that... that was blue blood! 
 What? No, I don't think so. 
 What? Wait, wait... Hang on, let me see that. 
 Oi, what's going on? That was blue blood! 
 No, I don't think so. 
 That boy is a Synth! 
 Let me see his hand, then... 
 Don't you touch him! 
 I've got you. 
 Look! 
 Look, I'm the Synth! Me! 
 What's goin' on?! 
 Run! 
 She's a Synth! A Synth! 
 Go on, get her! 
 Kill her! 
 It's freezing out here. 
 How about we go inside and finish our wine? 
 Um, I've got a really early meeting tomorrow. 
 You wouldn't mind if we just called it a night, would you? 
 No, of course not. 
 Can I call you a cab, or...? 
 Um, no, no, it's fine. Stanley drove. 
 Well, I'll... I'll see myself out. 
 OK. 
 Joe! 
 Sam! 
 Where's Karen? 
 They're trying to hurt her. 
 Come with me. 
 Stay in the car. 
 Oh, God...
