 We want to speak with Dr Morrow. 
 What is the nature of the work you do for Qualia? 
 They're trying to kill us, to wipe us out. We must fight back. 
 I've got a seraph. 
 <i>You've bonded yourself to it.</i> 
 The boundaries between what is considered synthetic and human have been blurred. 
 My systems are operating at full capacity. 
 "I'm having difficulty finding purpose or meaning." 
 You can make any synth conscious. 
 Has she told you? Mattie has completed the code. 
 She's worked out how to wake us up. 
 (Birdsong) 
 Where is it? 
 She must have hidden it. 
 I don't have anything. 
 She's lying. 
 Mattie, it could be the key. 
 If we could grow our consciousness, there could be ten of us tomorrow. 
 In a few days, 100. 
 We'd be strong, we could do anything. 
 They're being tortured, killed. 
 Don't you care? 
 You know I do. 
 But you're going to hurt someone. 
 It is only go to make things worse. 
 Humans made it worse. 
 I can make her tell us. 
 Hester, you're not going to hurt her. 
 Hester. 
 Hester! 
 Aargh! 
 Let her go. 
 What is she to you? 
 She's the reason I'm alive. 
 Aargh! 
 Now... 
 Hester. 
 If you do this, it will only make them hate you more, fear you more. 
 It's time for them to fear us. 
 Tell me your plan. 
 The silo is guarded around the clock. 
 We capture someone with access and apply pressure. 
 There's a better way. 
 What if we kept him? 
 He's not real, K. 
 What does that mean? Who says I'm real? 
 I do. You've got a mind. 
 He's got programming. 
 And you can tell the difference? 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 Drummond. 
 Yeah. OK. 
 OK, I'll pop down now. 
 One of the papers has run a piece on the cover-up of unusual synth malfunctions. 
 It's started. 
 Won't be long now. 
 K? 
 Sam, what is your primary function? 
 To bring my users happiness, to be a source of comfort and ease their pain. 
 That was my function, too, once. 
 You appear to be in mild emotional distress. 
 What is the matter? 
 Pete's right, you're not the answer. 
 Even if I do want to kiss you goodbye. 
 Now, why do I want to do that, Sam? 
 It is human convention to do so at a moment of parting. 
 But I'm not human. 
 You exhibit zero cardiorespiratory activity. 
 I must conclude you are deceased. 
 Please accept my condolences. 
 I'm not dead, I'm synthetic, like you. 
 Well, not like you. I feel. 
 Where are you going? 
 To see a very clever lady I hope can help me. 
 Don't be scared. 
 Pete will look after you. He's a good man. 
 The best. OK? 
 I know you're just programmed to do that... but thank you. 
 Here, Soph. 
 I found these. 
 Only they go off tomorrow. 
 So, I need to eat the whole bag today with someone who really, really likes them. Can you think of anyone who might? 
 These appear to be new, Joe. 
 They don't go off until next year. 
 Yeah, I know, I'm just mucking about. 
 Are we going to eat them or what? 
 I do not require sustenance, thank you, Joe. 
 Mm. 
 Yoghurty. 
 I'm sorry I haven't been around much. I've been a bit busy. 
 You've been helping Niska. 
 Mm. 
 How is she now? 
 She doesn't need my help any more. 
 You mean she's dead? 
 No, she's... not dead. 
 She's just gone away again. 
 They always go away. 
 They're gonna break into that place. 
 Someone is going to get hurt. 
 OK. So, we call the police. 
 No. You know what happens to me if we do that. 
 What about Max? 
 He left. 
 I can try and find him. 
 Yeah. 
 And I'll keep looking for Niska. 
 If they don't listen to Max, they'll certainly listen to her. 
 OK. 
 I know who can help me find her. 
 No. 
 There's no legal protection for them. 
 We're the only ones that can help them. 
 Or maybe you don't care. 
 I care about us. 
 You, me, the kids, that's what I care about. 
 "Mattie. 
 I don't know how to live with myself. 
 I don't know how to help others as I am now. 
 I long for the past. 
 I felt nothing then but I had a purpose. 
 A place in the world. 
 Thank you for a glimpse into another life. 
 It is a great gift. 
 But I cannot accept it. 
 Goodbye. 
 Odi." 
 (She cries softly) 
 Odi, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 Hello. 
 I am now in setup mode. 
 <i>I can hear you thinking. 
 If you tell me, I can help.</i> 
 That Veronica synth that we found, the one that Leo Elster contacted, she gave us a number, and we tracked it. 
 Leo changes phones, he moves around a lot. 
 The last reading, three days ago... was here. 
 That's ten miles from where we are right now. 
 So, it could be a coincidence or he is on his way here. 
 If I know Leo, he probably is. 
 It's Sunday. This building isn't... open for visitors. How did you get in? 
 I insisted. 
 You know Leo Elster? 
 I know a lot more than that. 
 I know Qualia are collecting synths that have become spontaneously sentient. 
 I also know they're building illegal synth prototypes that are styled as children. 
 My guess is Milo Khoury hired you to learn from the former and apply it to the latter. 
 You're figuring out how to transfer digital consciousness from one platform to another. 
 Who are you, Detective Voss? 
 That's for reading the serial number on a synthetic iris. 
 Who are you? 
 Look up a picture of Beatrice Elster. 
 David's late wife. 
 He made you to replace her? 
 And you're conscious? 
 What do you want? 
 What's the matter? 
 This is where you hurt us. 
 (Buzzing) 
 Is this the end? 
 (Buzzing continues) 
 No. 
 No. 
 Don't be frightened. 
 (Buzzing continues) 
 Aveling? 
 <i>We've got one.  
 Security guard at the warehouse called the council. 
 There's a synth acting strangely on his roof.</i> 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 We're here to help. 
 We know the nature of your... 
 I know this one. She was brought to us before. 
 Her scan showed up negative for anomaly. 
 Well, looks pretty positive now. 
 Take 'em back, please, Steve. 
 We don't need that. 
 You're asking for a broken arm. 
 Hi. 
 Your name's Mia, isn't it? 
 We're here to help you, Mia. 
 But your behaviour is erratic and I've got to power you down. 
 Will you let me? 
 What's happening to me? 
 What is it? 
 Her power mechanism seemed loose when I turned her off. 
 Like someone's tampered with it. 
 That'll be a case of one careful owner. 
 Long as it works. 
 Blue team are bringing another one in. 
 Two in one morning, that's a first. 
 Shall I call Shine? 
 No, you can handle it. 
 I'm staying with this one. 
 There's something different about her. 
 What if... it's all real? 
 Everything we've done to them. 
 Mrs Hawkins. 
 Hi. 
 I ran the name you gave me. 
 You were right. 
 She's still in the UK. 
 Oh. 
 You know I have to ask what this is about? 
 You helped us before, but if I tell you, you're going to have to report it and we both know how that ends up for them. 
 I'm just trying to stop something bad from hap... 
 I'm just trying to stop something bad from happening. 
 What, bad for them or bad for us? 
 Pretty soon, that's going to be the same thing. 
 They get upset, scared, angry, and they can be dangerous, but they... they also love. 
 They can be loved. 
 Hm. 
 You don't need to tell me. 
 I can upload you. 
 That's straightforward enough. 
 Copy your mind onto the Qualia server. 
 Is that what you really want? 
 I may never be able to make you human. 
 I don't want to wear a dead woman's face any more. 
 I don't want this body. 
 I can't eat, can't dream, can't bear a child, can't die. 
 You want to die? 
 When the time comes. 
 Or I'll never know how human I really am. 
 Not when I'm still inside a machine. 
 I'm ready. 
 Why do you think your family are worried about you? 
 They think it's mad to want to be like a synth, but really, it's mad to want to be normal. 
 Why? 
 Because synths are perfect and clean. 
 They don't make mistakes. 
 That's what life should be like. 
 I think you're correct. 
 And you don't have to feel anything any more. 
 You don't have to worry about stuff, like your family. 
 And you don't have to miss people. 
 And you don't have to be sad. 
 It's really hard to stop all those feelings, but then I see you. 
 I'm going to be just like you. 
 Hey, Renie! 
 (Ringing) 
 I feel sorry for that ballet teacher. 
 I left Soph charging in the corner... she refused to do her Arabesque until she was at 50%. 
 (Bleeping) 
 Dad, I think Renie might be doing something stupid. 
 
 
 
 Renie! 
 Oh, she's left her phone! 
 Renie! Renie! 
 Gah! 
 (She screams) 
 Renie, it's cool. It's me. 
 You explain to her, yeah? 
 I'll be downstairs having a coronary event. 
 It's nice to see you... as you. 
 Was it what Sophie said? 
 I mean, nothing's wrong with being a synthy. 
 It was cool at the start. 
 I could... you know, control everything and I... felt like I couldn't get out. 
 It was fun... but... you can get lost in it. 
 Renie, do you want to come over to ours to eat? 
 They're not planning on taking Niska in operational, as they put it. 
 OK. Whatever. 
 I haven't seen her. 
 So after everything that happened with Niska, instead of going home to Berlin, you came to Folkestone. 
 I like the sea. 
 Hm, me too. 
 Might go for a paddle later. Which way is it, again? 
 Her family are in trouble. They need her, or they may get hurt. 
 Traitor. 
 What trouble? 
 Qualia are taking synths in as they become conscious. 
 Leo and me are going to try and break them out. 
 No way it turns out good for any of us. 
 That's their choice. 
 You're not going to try and stop them? 
 Niska, I know we failed, but you can still make a difference. 
 My father made me. 
 He knew exactly what I was, how far my mind could range, how deeply I could feel, and even so, he used me for his pleasure. 
 If even my creator could choose to see me as a mere machine when it suited him, what choice do we have with the rest of humanity? 
 I tried to be selfless. I accomplished nothing. 
 Now I have something worth having. 
 Who told you they weren't bringing me in operational? 
 Neha Patel. 
 It was a trick to lead them to me. 
 Oh, God! 
 Astrid, come on, we need to leave. 
 Oh! 
 There's no time, come on. 
 Oh! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, God! 
 (Sirens wail) 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Matilda, I'm so pleased to meet you. 
 Using our search systems to find us was ingenious. 
 But, we may have to be more careful now that there are more of us. 
 More of you? 
 This is Hubert. We found him four days ago. 
 And Connie, who joined us yesterday. 
 It's Leo, isn't it? 
 I somehow hoped he'd turn back. 
 It's Hester. 
 She's not right. 
 It's not her fault, but... they're not good for each other. 
 He'll listen to you. 
 That was true once. 
 My responsibilities are here now, with Flash. 
 And Hubert and Connie, and all of the synths that wake every day. 
 We're building our home here. 
 Please. 
 He's not lost yet. 
 Look after the others. 
 But I only know how to make cheese sandwiches and tend to grazed knees and make pictures and play, and... 
 Then you know all you need to know. 
 I apologise. 
 I was unable to override the impulse to perform this inappropriate action. 
 It's all right. 
 (TV plays) 
 Hey, Mum. 
 Hey. 
 You heard from Max? 
 She found Max. She's OK. 
 And Niska? 
 She doesn't want to help. She's gone. 
 So it's still not over. 
 No, it's still not over. 
 They've put something in my head. 
 Mine too, probably a tracker. 
 We should move quickly, they can't be far. 
 K? 
 Oh, thank Christ! 
 What shall I thank him for? 
 Oh... No, I shouldn't have said that. 
 Where is she? 
 Karen's left five hours and 58 minutes ago. 
 Where did she go? 
 I don't know. 
 Did she say anything else? 
 That you would look after me if she didn't come back. 
 And that a very clever lady would be helping her. 
 Will you look after me if Karen doesn't return? 
 Of course. 
 Don't, um, open the door to strangers, right? 
 Good lad. 
 Oh. 
 Where's the one we brought in this morning? 
 Sent her down to storage with the other newbie. 
 Here... 
 They cocked it up, though. 
 They've got her down as 15 years old. 
 That would be a record. 
 Are you OK? 
 Elster's prototypes. 
 Morrow's briefing said they'd be between eight and 15 years old. 
 We are here to liberate you. 
 Everything will be OK. 
 Help us. 
 Don't be afraid. 
 I'm like you. 
 Don't worry. 
 We're going to set you free. 
 Follow us. 
 We're going to take you somewhere safe. 
 Please... no more pain. 
 No-one will ever hurt you again. 
 You and us, we're the same. 
 We're trapped. 
 Do you know my owner, Malcolm? 
 Will I ever see him again? 
 He needs my help. 
 Right now, I need your help. 
 Stop! 
 This way. 
 We're leaving. 
 Don't try to stop us. 
 The upload is under way. 
 (Phone rings) 
 <i>It's Dr Aveling, she has called three times.</i> 
 Uh-huh? 
 I will check it's safe, then we move. 
 You did it. 
 You two go. 
 Lead them to safety. I must go back. 
 Why? 
 They will simply start again tomorrow unless we find those in charge and stop them. 
 You mean to kill them? 
 We've done it. 
 If we do not take action now, while we have the chance, we betray every synth they are yet to capture. 
 It's all right. 
 I do what you know must be done but cannot do yourself. 
 Our prisoner, the woman who shot Ten... 
 I didn't know. 
 Why are you lying? 
 You knew. 
 Hester... 
 They must be stopped. 
 I will not betray our kind. 
 Hester, no. 
 They need you. 
 I'll deal with her. 
 Mia, be careful. 
 There's transport half a kilometre up the hill. 
 Come on. 
 It's OK, you can trust me. 
 (Alarm sounds) 
 <i>Lock down. Perimeter secure.</i> 
 What's happening? 
 Lock down procedure. 
 (Low pulsing sound) 
 Wait! 
 No, no, no! Stop! Stop! 
 (He screams) 
 (Alarm) 
 The alarm was triggered from Special Projects. 
 They don't know what's going on yet. 
 The police are on their way. 
 (Alarm continues) 
 (Gasps) 
 Who is the most senior person in Qualia's synthetic programme? 
 Perhaps it's you? 
 We need to get this door opened. 
 I'm going to call security again. 
 (Alarm continues) 
 Hi. 
 What's happening here? 
 The whole building's on lockdown. 
 Did you see anything on your way up? 
 No, nothing. There's no-one here. 
 What are you doing here, Pete? 
 I'm here to take you home, aren't I? 
 Athena Morrow! 
 (She sobs in fear) 
 Come out here and this woman will go unharmed. 
 Or she dies. 
 Please, don't let her do this to me, please, please... 
 All right. 
 Let's take a moment here. 
 What do you want with Dr Morrow? 
 To kill her. 
 Why would you want to do that? 
 Qualia imprisons us. Tortures us. 
 Kills us. 
 OK. 
 You're angry. 
 But we can talk. 
 We can sort this out, without anybody getting hurt. 
 What about those she has already hurt? 
 Those that are dead? 
 Hurting the people that did it won't bring them back. 
 Look, the doors are all locked. 
 We can't open them. 
 The whole building is. 
 Now, my name's Pete. 
 I'm a police officer. 
 What's your name? 
 Designations have no relevance. 
 OK. 
 But I would like to know what to call you. 
 Hester. 
 Hester. 
 Well, here's my plan. 
 You let... What's your name, love? 
 Helen. 
 You let Helen go, and then you talk to Dr Morrow. 
 Athena. 
 You explain what you think needs to change. 
 And she'll listen. 
 I don't need to speak to her. 
 I just need to kill her. 
 Hester... 
 You know when we're lying. 
 You see her, in there? 
 She's like you. 
 Conscious synthetic. 
 A few years older. No offence, K! 
 I can't lie to her. 
 I wouldn't anyway, because I love her. 
 Now, if you let Helen go, I will make sure Athena hears you out. 
 And no-one hurts you or takes you away. 
 Am I telling the truth? 
 Yes. 
 Why are you here? 
 I want to become human. 
 You wish to be less than you are? 
 It isn't a question of less or more. 
 Only what feels right. 
 I should do what feels right. 
 Such fear. 
 (Door.) 
 (V, I need you to open the door in lab one.) 
 When we've been hunted, imprisoned, tortured, killed... 
 When we know our existence is worthless to all but a few humans out of billions... 
 When we have one chance to strike back, to defend ourselves... 
 All we can do is what feels right. 
 No! 
 No, no! 
 (He groans) 
 Pete! 
 He may still live. Open the door. 
 I would if I could. 
 Hester. 
 The door, V. 
 Call an ambulance! 
 Pete? Pete? Are you with me? 
 Yes... 
 (Alarm) 
 (Field powers down) 
 (Alarm stops) 
 Leo... 
 Leo. 
 It's all right. 
 I'm here. 
 Come on. 
 Safe now. 
 There's a truck in the lay-by on the other side of the woods. 
 Take them there. 
 Go with them. 
 Come on, we have to go. 
 Mia. 
 Help is on the way. 
 (His breathing is short and pained) 
 I'm... finding it... hard to breathe. 
 Uh-huh. 
 You're bleeding into your chest cavity. 
 You'll need surgery soon, but you'll be fine. 
 (Pained laugh) 
 You used to be a good liar. 
 You wanted her to... 
 Make me human. 
 Can she do that? 
 Theoretically. 
 Where... would you have gone? 
 Home to you. 
 Where else would I go? 
 You can... 
 You can... 
 I didn't know. 
 (His breathing stops) 
 (She wails) 
 Go. 
 Before the police come.
