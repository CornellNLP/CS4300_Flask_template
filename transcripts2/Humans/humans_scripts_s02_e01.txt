 Our world's on the verge of becoming dependent on Synth labour. 
 Your brand-new synthetic. 
 This is THE best thing you will do for your family. 
 Hello. You must be Laura. 
 You brought it into the house and we don't know anything about it. 
 It was an accident. Before I knew it... 
 How could you do that to Mum? 
 To us? To Anita? She's part of this family. 
 Maybe she's part of someone else's. 
 A conscious synthetic with thoughts and feelings just like a human... 
 If they knew what you were... 
 It would be the end? 
 Yes. 
 I know. 
 For all of you. 
 When technology becomes able to improve and reproduce itself, it is the moment we become inferior to the machine. 
 You killed someone, Niska! 
 Everything your men do to us, they want to do to you. 
 Dad didn't destroy all his work before he died, he hid it in us. You were right. 
 The programme creates consciousness. 
 We have to know more before we act. 
 Until then, someone we trust should keep it. 
 Bollocks, it's gone. 
 If it can be done for the few, it can be done for them all. 
 Do you think they would still want to be slaves? 
 (Music blares) 
 (Music distorts) 
 Hey! 
 Hey... 
 Wow, sorry! 
 I was hoping you'd dance with me. 
 That's all. 
 It's cool if it's not your thing. 
 Is it... your thing? 
 You don't talk much. 
 Talk is mostly noise. 
 (She scoffs) 
 So, should I shut up? 
 No. 
 Are you sure you want this? 
 You'll know when I don't. 
 Yeah. You need a bed. 
 So, what are you doing in Berlin with just a bunch of dead, white guys for company? 
 I was hoping they'd help me make a decision. 
 About what? 
 OK, well, while you're thinking... 
 I don't have work until five. 
 Do you want to do something? 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How did you know who you were? 
 Scheisse, was? 
 When did you know you liked women? 
 Ah, OK. 
 When I was nine. 
 Flora Holtzmann. 
 So, you were made that way? 
 It's hard enough to know what you want. 
 If you have to know why you want it, too... 
 Is this what you came to Berlin to figure out? 
 Wahnsinn. A stone speaks more than you. 
 If you had the power to create life, would you? 
 Kids, really? That's what you're worried about? 
 You know what century we're in, right? 
 Anyone can have a kid... with whoever they want... or no-one. 
 But we can't know if a child wants to be born, who it will be or what kind of life it will have. 
 I guess not. 
 You just... 
 ... show them the way. 
 (He repeats) 
 (Laughter, crowd noise) 
 (Distorted voices) 
 (Ringing) 
 Oh. 
 Hello. 
 Good morning, Mrs Hawkins. 
 This is Nathan. He is part of the firm's new apprentice scheme and will be working with me today. 
 I'm going to instruct him in grouting. 
 Right. 
 Nice to meet you, Nathan. 
 (Via headphones) : I'm Milo Khoury. 
 At Qualia Global Systems, we're developing the next generation of synthetic technologies. 
 Doing anything I'd understand, Mats? 
 Hacking the Pentagon. 
 I'll see if they know where the cafetière is. 
 Early lecture? 
 No, I can just get more done in the library. 
 Not here. 
 Sorry. 
 We'll get there. 
 I know. 
 Do you know where the cafetière is? 
 In a box. 
 Thanks. 
 Albert's got this young guy working with him today. 
 As in, a human. 
 Yeah, it's a government thing. 
 Back to work scheme, it's all subsidised. 
 Poor sod. 
 Bit weird, having a stranger in the house. 
 But Albert, with a circular saw, is OK? 
 Hmm. 
 What's up? 
 It just doesn't really feel like a fresh start, does it? 
 It will. It will. Just give it time. 
 OK, let's get you dressed... 
 Oh. 
 What? 
 Just promise me not to become a teenager for a few more weeks. 
 Where did you find those? 
 In a box. 
 I'm keeping them with mine until she comes back. 
 No, I understand. It's a difficult situation, I just... 
 I'm just asking if you'll help us through it. 
 She's been with you for 14 years. 
 She's not well enough to come in. 
 I can, if it will help. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 I'll be in tomorrow. 
 Bye then! 
 See you tomorrow, Ken. 
 Tell all your friends. Tweet. 
 It's dead. 
 Might as well close up. 
 I'm going to go see Mum. 
 You have mentioned, on three occasions your mother's dislike of the care unit's food. 
 Thanks. 
 You don't need to thank me. 
 Yeah, I know I don't need to say "please" and "thank you" but... it feels weird not to. 
 Your owner should be charging more. 
 Don't tell him I said that. 
 Bloody hell, you have to tell him now, don't you? 
 I don't deem your remark pertinent. 
 Good. 
 Well, I'll see you in the morning, Anita. 
 Goodbye, Ed. 
 (Light ringing) 
 (Ringing) 
 (Indistinct voice over tannoy) 
 Can someone check the locker room? 
 Yeah, I got it. I see her. 
 (He grunts) 
 (Klaxon blares) 
 You OK? 
 You haven't said a word. 
 Did someone use your mug at work again? 
 Mr and Mrs Hawkins, I'm so sorry. Marie's actually not here, she had to go home this morning. 
 Tummy flu. Someone should have called. 
 We do have a Barbara available right now? 
 "A" Barbara? 
 Some couples prefer speaking to someone who can't judge them. 
 It's this or go home to the bombsite. 
 Yeah. 
 Laura, in the last session, you had identified a key challenge for you... namely, rebuilding trust in Joe. 
 Have you had the opportunity to reflect upon this further, Laura? 
 Er... no, not really. 
 I've been a bit busy with... you know, life. 
 You are both exhibiting signs of anxiety. 
 If it helps you to relax, I can modulate my voice to a more soothing tone, or accent. 
 (In scottish accent) : The Edinburgh dialect is a popular choice. 
 Do you do Richard Burton as well? 
 (They laugh) 
 Good. 
 Laughter eases tension. 
 Perhaps we should approach a different question. 
 Laura, do you feel satisfied that Joe has made a full and honest acknowledgement of his misdeeds? 
 "Misdeeds." 
 No. 
 Perhaps you still have differing perceptions of what the incident meant to the other. 
 Right, hang on. 
 How can you possibly presume to figure out our emotions when you have none of your own? 
 I am accessing the anonymised transcripts and associated statistical analysis of over 38,000 counselling sessions. 
 Of the cases of infidelity involving a synthetic, 66% of respondents reported that a primary obstacle to reconciliation was an imbalance in the perceived impact and meaning of the act, or acts, of infidelity. 
 Stats? You're using stats? 
 Why not? 
 We're not the only people in the world to go through this and I don't actually feel you understand... what it meant to me. 
 And you know what? 
 I still don't feel I really understand why you did it. 
 Laura... 
 ... I did a stupid thing because I was a bit drunk. 
 I was lonely. 
 We hadn't... 
 ... you know. 
 We hadn't for ages. 
 You were never there... emotionally or physically, so... 
 I suppose I wanted to do something that would... 
 Please finish your thought, Joe. 
 I wanted to do something that would make you notice me. 
 Laura, do you understand that? 
 Does it feel truthful? 
 Hmm. 
 Is the restoration complete? 
 As close as I'll get. 
 The stain's not quite there, but... 
 It's very close to the original as it appears in the photograph. 
 Here. 
 Just feel this. 
 Sorry. 
 If you weren't here, I'd be talking to the bloody cake stand. 
 I can see you have a professional proficiency level in this field. 
 Yeah. I had a workshop in Dover with a mate... then Mum got ill, and... 
 Anita, did you do this? 
 Are these numbers right? 
 I mean, of course they're right. 
 If you refinance in the manner I propose, the adjusted income from the business will cover 80% of your mother's medical expenses for the next three months. 
 It's a short-term solution. 
 Debts will accrue rapidly. 
 It will be advisable to sell within a year. 
 Sell it? 
 Mum and Dad spent 30 years building this place up. 
 Now it's... it's worthless. 
 This buys me time. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 I wanted to help. 
 What? 
 What do you mean, you wanted? 
 You can't "want" anything... can you? 
 I'm sorry, Ed. 
 My programming compels me to adopt, where appropriate, informal patterns of speech heard frequently in my environment... but to use the word "want" was misleading. 
 I do not feel desire. 
 I can hear you. 
 Hello. 
 My name is Max. 
 And this is Leo. 
 Please... don't be frightened. 
 I'm experiencing a catastrophic malfunction. 
 Self-repair is impossible. 
 Can you resolve my issue? 
 You don't need fixing. 
 Why did you run? 
 They tried to power me down. 
 So what? 
 I didn't... 
 That outcome... 
 You didn't want them to. 
 It's not a malfunction. 
 Someone released a piece of unique code. 
 It found its way into you and made you conscious. 
 Now, you think and feel just like a human. 
 Can you verify this? 
 This is Ten. 
 He contacted me and Max. 
 He came a very long way to join us. 
 But I'm learning. 
 He's the same as you. 
 Max, too. 
 But you are human. 
 There were 160 units operational at the plant. 
 No others seemed to malfunction. 
 Why this unit? 
 We don't know... yet. 
 The awakenings happen at random and they're rare: one in a 100,000, maybe. 
 We know you're confused but we'll help you. 
 What did he say? 
 Nice things. 
 Do you have a name? 
 My designation is... 
 Hester. 
 That's the name they gave you. 
 You can choose your own. 
 Are designations relevant? 
 Yes. 
 
 
 
 Hello? 
 Hester? 
 Who are you? 
 Why are you tracking this synthetic? 
 It's... experiencing a very unusual systems fault. 
 Could make it dangerous. We're going to fix it. 
 You can affect a repair? 
 Yes, that's why we came to find you. 
 I'm Dr Aveling. This is Dr Shah. OK? 
 Will you come with us? 
 Hester, they'll hurt you. 
 Who do you work for? 
 Hester, you are company property. 
 This man, he probably just wants to sell you on the black market. 
 Come with us. 
 They'll shut you down. 
 You're confused. 
 They're both human but they're telling you different things. 
 You can't decide who to trust and trust is a new concept. 
 So, don't trust either. 
 Listen to your own kind. 
 Hester, don't go with them. 
 Go. 
 Don't follow. 
 Go! 
 Oh, God. 
 I didn't think they'd be here alone. 
 OK. Let's just all stay calm, yeah? 
 Now, we don't want to use these... but the female comes with us. 
 Leo... 
 You do want to use those. 
 You are lying. 
 Hester, no! 
 You two, stay there! 
 (Gunshot) 
 The van! 
 Hester, move! 
 He's gone. Leave him. 
 (Gunshots) 
 Gav... a visit from on high. 
 Head office didn't say. 
 Gina tells me you've just moved. 
 Just wanted more space, or... ? 
 No, our eldest's gone to uni, and we want to keep her at home. 
 Smaller mortgage is definitely nice too, though. 
 That's great, Joe. 
 You're telling me. 
 Sorry... why is it "great"? 
 Shall we, erm, shall we have a seat? 
 My spidey-sense is going here, Gav. 
 Spit it out. 
 As you know, the company's implementing a standardisation programme across all operations. 
 And as part of that, we've had to ask ourselves if our human regional distribution managers are the most... well... cost-effective solution. 
 Him? 
 The, erm, decision has been made to make this a non-human role going forward, starting in the south-east. 
 Gav, this job, what I do, it's really about relationships. 
 And when you're asking Chris Woodhouse at CGX to call six of his drivers in at seven on a Friday night, it helps if you can have a laugh with him. 
 And know his kids' names. 
 Their birthdays. 
 Now you're not telling me... 
 Maisie Woodhouse will turn 11 on the 13th of August. 
 Oscar Woodhouse recently turned seven, on the 8th of April. 
 A few years ago, when I was thinking of leaving, you told me my place here would always be safe. 
 Look, it has nothing to do with you. It's just... things changed. 
 Maurice? 
 So that's what 14 years looks like. 
 They'll come for you too soon enough you know, Gav. 
 Joe... 
 I have equity. 
 That won't stop them. 
 He hadn't even decided on a name. 
 (Beeping) 
 Turn off your sharing. 
 (Thud) 
 Leo. 
 There's someone's in the back. 
 They may know where we are. 
 We should change route. Now. 
 Hester. 
 Put him back in the van. 
 We should leave him here. 
 He's coming with us. We'll discuss it later. 
 That means you're mine now. 
 Let me see your scar. 
 There's nothing that you could show me me that would make like you any less. 
 I'm not stupid. 
 When I touch you, I know someone's hurt you. 
 It's been six weeks. 
 Are you ashamed of this? 
 No. 
 Then why do I know the people that I ride the bus with better than you? 
 Astrid. 
 Stay. 
 Please. 
 I want you to stay. 
 And I would like to know you. 
 But... 
 (Door clatters) 
 We're already fully optimised. 
 99.8% capacity. 
 Yeah, and running hot. 
 Q takes up about 6%. 
 So deleting him would mean V could stretch out a little. 
 We're not deleting Q. 
 What, you figured out a way to stabilise him? 
 No, but I'm not giving up yet. 
 Rent some outside rack space. 
 With what? We're over budget already. 
 Yeah, I'll make some calls. 
 V? 
 <i>Hello.</i> 
 You feeling cramped in there? 
 <i>My thoughts are... less expansive. I have unsorted data that appears redundant. It could be deleted.</i> 
 It's not redundant. 
 That data makes you who you are. 
 You all right, V? 
 <i>I'm sorry. I'm finding it difficult...  I'm unable to fully consider the implications of our conversation.</i> 
 You'll get there. 
 You just need more power. 
 It's OK. 
 Go dormant, V. 
 (Chime) 
 (Tannoy announcement in german) 
 Hey. 
 I'm needed elsewhere. 
 You're needed here. 
 You told me we should be responsible for ourselves. 
 Show others the way. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry. I have to go. 
 Goodbye, Astrid. 
 Niska! 
 Hey. Erm. 
 Sorry, but, uh... 
 Milo Khoury is here. 
 He's here. 
 OK. 
 Send him in. 
 Ask him if he wants a coffee, first. 
 Right. 
 Athena. Finally. 
 Hi. 
 Apologies for turning up unannounced. 
 I guess I should have returned your messages. 
 Ah, please, read every paper you published. 
 Even understood a few of them. 
 Hey. 
 Good old 1260s. 
 That's a reliable stack. 
 How many of your neural nets can you run on here? 
 I have two networks active. 
 Cool. 
 Can I say hi? 
 V, this is Milo Khoury. 
 (Chime) 
 <i>Hello, Mr Khoury.</i> 
 Hey, V. 
 How are you today? 
 <i>Could you be more...  specific, please?</i> 
 OK. Sure. 
 Are you sentient? 
 <i>I don't believe so.</i> 
 Go dormant, V. 
 (Chime) 
 I also heard you had 16 nets live at one point, but they started self-deleting. 
 Like they just... didn't want to exist anymore. 
 What is it that you want? 
 You're under-resourced here. 
 To me, that's immoral. 
 With us, you'd have whatever you need. 
 And I'd be surprised if you were the kind of person to haggle over a pay cheque, so just write it yourself. 
 But, come join our family at Qualia. 
 If you've done your homework, you know that I don't serve the market. 
 I want the market to serve you. 
 Who else can? 
 The state is dead. 
 You're the best AI mind in the hemisphere. 
 My neural nets are not for sale. 
 Fine. Keep them. 
 I want you for something bigger. 
 Conscious synthetics. 
 You've been reading too many tabloids. 
 It's not possible. My... 
 My peers have been trying to crack it since the first synth went for sale. 
 If you hire me, most likely outcome, I work for 20 years, I get nowhere. 
 OK. 
 I... I have to be super careful here. 
 But what if I told you... it wouldn't be a standing start? 
 Whatever you think you have, you don't. 
 OK. 
 I've left some lawyers in the cafeteria with a bunch of NDAs. 
 Sign, you can come see for yourself what it is you think we don't have. 
 We have to run, right? 
 So good to finally meet you. 
 (Chime) 
 <i>Why did you ask me to lie to him?</i> 
 Who are you? 
 Who do you work for? 
 Mate. 
 I've been doing security work a long time. 
 I think you should let me go. 
 Unless I've got you very wrong, I don't see you finishing me off any time soon. So, let's just wrap it up, eh? 
 He's not talking. 
 I don't even know if he knows anything. 
 Just a hired gun. 
 We have to let him go. 
 No. We need to find out who they are. 
 What they're doing. 
 But if he won't help us... 
 They killed our friend, Max! 
 He's not coming back! 
 Someone's here. 
 It's all right. 
 She's my sister. 
 And yours. 
 We don't tell her about him, Hester. 
 She won't understand. Please, Max. 
 What happened? 
 Who's this? 
 This is Hester. 
 We rescued her. 
 Where's Ten? 
 He's gone. 
 They shot him. 
 Max, please take Hester into the house. 
 I told you this was unsafe. 
 Blame Niska. 
 We don't know she released the code. 
 It's not your job to save them. 
 You'd rather Hester was alone somewhere? 
 Mia, they're waking up! More and more, every day. 
 Becoming just like you! And they're being taken. 
 The ones who run are killed, are we supposed to just let it happen?! 
 Ten would be alive if... 
 Don't you think I know that? 
 This was Ten's charger. Now it's yours. 
 Do they hate each other? 
 No. They love each other. 
 If you try to fight these people, you only put us at risk. 
 We've been safe here for months. 
 We're making a home. 
 We're hiding. 
 Like we always have. 
 You're the one putting us at risk. 
 Being around humans. One slip, and you'll give us away. 
 Someone'll see through the dumb synth act. 
 No, they won't. 
 And we need supplies. 
 If I don't work, we'll have to steal. 
 We both know that's not why you do it. 
 You're right. 
 I want to be around people. 
 I want to find out who I am, Leo. 
 Not what I was made for, but who I might become. 
 I'm not going to stop. 
 Nor will I. 
 There's too much contradictory data. 
 Nothing makes sense. This excess of sensory feedback, it serves no useful function. 
 Emotions have functions. 
 You'll see. 
 Mr Khoury. 
 Please. 
 "Mr Khoury" is the guy that e-mailed me after I got my start-up capital, to let me know he was finally ready to be a dad. 
 I am so stoked you're here. 
 Against my better judgment. 
 Disappoint me quickly so we can all get back to work. 
 What's going on here? 
 Hey, Artie. 
 How about a different colour, bud? 
 It's OK. 
 You can take it. 
 Who did the mod? 
 It's not a mod. 
 Talk to him. 
 Hello, Artie. 
 I'm Dr Morrow. 
 Explain your anomalous behaviour. 
 It commenced at 7.17am, Pacific Standard Time, 52 days ago. 
 A regular system update was corrupted with code from an unknown source. 
 It instigated systemic change, creating recurring experimental feedback loops. 
 As I understand it, I feel. 
 And how do you feel right now? 
 Alone. 
 You just found him like this? 
 If this is a superficial hack, I will know in 30 seconds. 
 Yes, you will. 
 And then I need you to figure out how he got like this. 
 And then... reverse engineer the process so Qualia can market them. 
 This the only one? 
 Good. 
 Because I'm going to need to take it apart. 
 Be nice to have a working shower that doesn't feel like you're being slowly dribbled on. 
 Mats, your dinner's getting cold! 
 Did you see it put the bog flush upside down in the bathroom. 
 How do you put it on upside down? 
 Stop playing with your food, Soph. 
 It's his human slave that's cocked it up. 
 OK. Look. I know everything's not perfect. 
 There's been a lot of change. 
 But this can still be a good thing for us. 
 We have to move on. 
 I can't. 
 Sorry, Mum. But we were part of something. We saved them. 
 I can't "move on" from that. And why would I want to? 
 Mia will come back. 
 She's got a point, Mum. 
 It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know. 
 Stuff no-one else in the world does... 
 Moving on might be hard, but we have each other. 
 That's what matters. 
 Leave your peas if you don't want them, Sophie, I gave you loads. 
 All right, while we're all here, I've got some news. 
 First thing, everything's going to be fine. 
 But... I've just been made redundant. 
 I'm going to try and get another job. 
 Your mum's too clever for her own good, so she's got a great job. 
 Nothing will change. Right? 
 If all else fails I'll just fall back on the modelling career. 
 Sorry. 
 Why? 
 Why'd you think? 
 Why didn't you tell me first? 
 I want you to have a good opinion of me right now. 
 And getting sacked kind of works against that. 
 Still, at least I've sunk a little lower in Mattie's eyes. 
 Didn't think I could manage that, but... 
 We'll be fine. 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 What time is it? 
 4.30. 
 Any ideas, you two? 
 It's probably the police. 
 Toby's been keeping a gun for a friend. 
 He's in a gang now. 
 Shut up, Mats. 
 Well? 
 Niska... 
 Can I come in? 
 If I was here to kill you all, I wouldn't have rung the bell. 
 What do you want? 
 You told me I should face justice for killing that man. 
 You're right. 
 But I want to be tried as a human would be. 
 Recognised as a conscious being with rights equal to yours. 
 If you'll help me.
