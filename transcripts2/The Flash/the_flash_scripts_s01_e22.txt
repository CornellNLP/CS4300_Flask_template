 Barry : My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. 
 When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 Barry : My father went to prison for her murder. 
 Then an accident made me the impossible. 
 To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. 
 And one day, I'll find who killed my mother... 
 Mom! 
 Barry : And get justice for my father. 
 I am The Flash. 
 Caitlin : Previously on  The Flash... 
 A man in yellow, he took Eddie. 
 Iris : Hi, Barry. 
 Or should I say The Flash? 
 Observe. Barry marries Iris, and not you. 
 I've been having these dreams. 
 What happens in the dreams? 
 Cisco : Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash, and he kills me. 
 Caitlin : If this is Dr. Wells, then who have we been working for this whole time? 
 Barry : A completely different person. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I don't want to kill you, Barry. I need you. 
 We will face each other again very soon. 
 Wells : I want you to take a moment, and think about all the things that define your life. 
 All the people you love. 
 Your job. 
 Your coworkers. 
 Your home. 
 And now imagine if one day, in a flash, all of that vanished. 
 Would you simply accept your new life and continue on? 
 Or would you do whatever it takes... to get back what was taken from you? 
 Because... 
 I can assure you. 
 I will get everything that was taken... from me.

 I kept asking myself, why would Wells pretend to need a wheelchair? 
 Sympathy, I suppose. 
 That's what I thought at first, but he's the man in yellow. He's the Reverse-Flash. 
 He's much smarter than that. 
 Sympathy can't be the only reason. 
 Yeah, it was a misdirect. 
 Just like everything else Wells has done. 
 I mean, the last person we'd suspect to be the man in yellow is someone who lost the use of their legs. 
 That's exactly right, Joe. 
 Which is why I started messing around with the wheelchair. 
 And that's when I found this. 
 Damn. You can't get that at Radio Shack. 
 Barry : Looks like the tech inside Gideon. 
 I measured the output, and this thing is kicking off serious juice. 
 I mean, we're talking enough to power all of Central City. 
 Seriously? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 What do you think Wells was using it for? 
 I think this thing is some kind of battery. 
 Battery? 
 As in, Wells was using it to power himself. 
 To gain more speed. 
 And that's why he's so much faster than you.

 Why would Wells want the Particle Accelerator to work again? 
 I don't know. It's not like it was such a big success the first time. 
 It made me The Flash. 
 That's not all it did. 
 Caitlin : So what happens if the Particle Accelerator turns on while the meta-humans are in their containment cells? 
 They're toast. 
 We put them down there and now their lives are in danger because of us. 
 Look, I think you all know I've never been a fan of this arrangement here. 
 I thought the whole plan was to rehabilitate them and set them free. 
 It was. 
 We've been a little busy. 
 Well, if they stay in there, the die. 
 And if we let them go, they destroy the city. 
 We're gonna have to move them. 
 Move them where? 
 Iron Heights can't handle meta-humans. 
 You're right, but Lian Yu can. 
 What the hell's a “Lian Yu?” 
 Lian Yu is the island where Oliver was stranded for five years. 
 A.R.G.U.S built a covert military prison on it. 
 It's where we sent Captain Boomerang. 
 Oliver keeps his worst criminals there. 
 They won't be able to escape, and more importantly, they won't be able to hurt anybody. 
 Great. So we ship them from one illegal black site to another? 
 Yeah, I guess so. Yes. 
 And how do we move them to Oliver's own private Alcatraz? 
 I'll call him. Maybe he can help with transport. 
 And Cisco... if we do this, nobody can get loose. 
 I might have a way of getting them out of here safely. 
 All right, get on it. 
 Barr, this is insane. 
 Joe, we have to do this. 
 You don't think that if we start bussing super-villains through downtown, nobody's gonna notice? 
 Oh, they'll notice. 
 That's where you'll come in. 
 Oh. 
 Cecile. 
 Aww. 
 How's my favorite D.A.? 
 Thanks for stopping by. 
 Hey, anything for my favorite detective. 
 Hey. 
 So what can I do for you? 
 You sounded a little cryptic on the phone. 
 Yeah, I wanted your opinion on something. 
 These people with powers, the meta-humans. 
 Is that what they're calling them? 
 People love their labels. 
 Yes. Let's say, hypothetically, I know a prison of sorts, a place that can do what Iron Heights can't. 
 Where these meta-humans, the bad ones, are being locked up. 
 I would be very concerned. 
 Especially if, hypothetically, you had anything to do with it. 
 Why are you asking me about this? 
 Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon, and you're the only other person I can trust to know this. 
 Okay, what are you asking me to do? 
 I need to clear a route through the city. 
 Barricades, police cars, the works. 
 What am I supposed to tell people? 
 The President's in town? 
 I don't know. 
 You think they'll believe you? 
 No, Joe, no. They wouldn't. 
 What you're doing, it's called unlawful imprisonment and human smuggling. 
 Joe, those are very bad things. 
 These are some bad people, Cecile. 
 But their lives are in danger. 
 I can't... I can't get involved in this, Joe. 
 I can't. 
 And as your friend, and quite possibly the attorney who will one day be prosecuting you, I'm telling you, get as far away from this as possible.

 My uncle owns it. 
 His company hauls frozen food cross country. 
 Okay, so I retrofitted the cooling system with the wheelchair's power source to create an energy damper. 
 Which means what, exactly? 
 Basically, the back of this rig is being flooded with so much power that it's effectively creating a transient pulse strong enough to disrupt the meta-humans' powers, so we can get them to the airport and get them on a plane without them getting fresh on us.

 What the hell is that? 
 Guys... 
 The Particle Accelerator is fully charged and online. 
 Whatever Wells needs it for, it's ready.

 [indistinct radio chatter] 
 Iris, there really isn't anything else to say. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 You're going to end this relationship because some lunatic from the future told you that I am destined to marry Barry? 
 Well, I don't believe that, okay? 
 I believe that we choose our own destiny. 
 I decide who I love, and I love you. 
 Whatever future Wells showed you, it is not my future. 
 It's not our future. 
 Please let me prove it. 
 This isn't about the future, Iris. 
 It's about here. 
 Now. Today. 
 Ever since the very beginning, there's been three people in this relationship. 
 You, me, and Barry. 
 That is not true. 
 You can deny it all you want. 
 But Barry knows it. 
 Joe knows it. 
 And if I'm gonna be completely honest with myself, I knew. 
 I always knew. 
 I guess I just... thought I could love you enough to change things.

 Well, I heard your prison transfer didn't go so well. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 All a part of your plan, I assume? 
 Actually, that didn't factor into my plan at all, but I'm impressed you went to such great lengths to keep those people from harm. 
 Ever the hero, huh, Barry? 
 You've hurt enough people. 
 I know. 
 You see me as the villain, but, Barry, if you were to look back, look back carefully at everything I've done, every wheel I have set in motion, you would realize I have only done what I had to do. 
 Nothing more. 
 Nothing less. 
 And the Particle Accelerator? 
 Barry : How does that fit into your grand plan? 
 Well, why don't you go on inside, and let me show you. 
 You know, I just learned the hard way not to trust the bad guy. 
 And yet... 
 I've shown you time and time again you can't beat me, Barry.
