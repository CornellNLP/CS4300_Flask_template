 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. 
 When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 My father went to prison for her murder. 
 Then an accident made me the impossible. 
 To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. 
 And one day, I'll find who killed my mother... 
 Mom! 
 And get justice for my father. 
 I am The Flash. 
 Previously on  The Flash... 
 If you ever need anything, I will race over in a heartbeat. 
 Same. Well, as fast as I can run. 
 Ray : Advanced Technology Operating Mechanism... A.T.O.M. 
 What are you gonna use it for? 
 To protect the people of this city. 
 You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom? 
 West : I don't know yet. 
 But I do know that Wells keeps secrets. 
 Barry : The way that he described running... feeling the wind and the power... it's like he was talking from experience. 
 Harrison Wells is The Reverse-Flash. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Eddie, we need your help. 
 [siren wailing] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Pedal to the metal. 
 female dispatcher : We've got a 10-31 in progress. 
 Shiny Diamond, 18th and Olive. 
 That's only a few blocks from here. 
 Has every crook in Central City gone crazy? 
 This is the third attempted robbery tonight. 
 Barry. We got another one. 
 Hello. 
 18th and Olive. 
 Got it. 
 Who's this? 
 Oh. Indecent exposure. Powell Park. 
 That ain't something you should be showing people. 
 They're getting away, guys. 
 They're not getting away, Eddie. 
 Let's get these bozos up ahead of us first, and then we'll worry about the idiots at the Shiny Diamond. 
 All right. 
 We're gonna run out of room, though. 
 I'll take care of that. 
 What do you think he meant by that? 
 Oh. That's what he meant. 
 I think we lost them. 
 Oh, no, you didn't. 
 And by the way, you're under arrest. 
 [chuckles] 
 We need to go. Now. Come on! 
 [alarm wailing] 
 Uh-uh. Freeze. 
 You guys missing these? 
 Thawne : On the ground. On the ground. 
 So, uh, I'm just curious, but... have you guys not heard of me, or what? 
 [laughs] 
 Nice work, detective. 
 Good night, Dr. Kang. 
 Good night. 
 [lock beeps] 
 [bee buzzing] 
 [engine turns over] 
 [bees buzzing] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [yelps] Oh... ow! 
 [screaming] 
 Victim's name is Lindsay Kang, engineering professor at Hudson University. 
 Just got tenure. 
 Hey. 
 So, her whole body's covered in these puncture wounds you see on her face. 
 Bite marks maybe. 
 Whatever it was, she must have gone into anaphylaxis. 
 Damn. 
 Yeah. 
 The blood sample should tell us everything we need to know. 
 I'll run tests back at my lab. 
 They can do it faster at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 Well, yeah, but, I mean, it's just... 
 It's just what? 
 It's kind of weird being there right now. 
 Barry, you know we have to play it cool with Wells. 
 If he finds out we suspect him... 
 I know. I get it. 
 I just think that we should tell Cisco and Caitlin. 
 They could help us. 
 The more people who know, the more chance Wells is gonna find out we're on to him. 
 I mean, what if one of them slips up? 
 Or panics? 
 Or what if... 
 What? 
 What if they're not on our side? 
 No. Absolutely not. 
 They're not involved in whatever he's planning. 
 I mean, Wells is their boss, their mentor. 
 They've been with him for a long time. 
 I've seen plenty of people make the wrong choice for loyalty. 
 Please do not include them until we can be sure. 
 All right. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Death by apitoxin. 
 Honeybee venom. 
 Bees. Why did it have to be bees? 
 Y'all, I don't do bees. 
 Ain't nobody got time for bees. 
 But when a honeybee stings, the stingers are literally torn from their abdomen, and they die. 
 But there were no stingers in the body and no dead bees in the car. 
 A honeybee can only deposit .1 milligrams of apitoxin when it releases its stinger. 
 Wells : And yet, Ms. Kang was found with enough venom in her system to kill a herd of elephants. 
 It appears not only is a meta-human controlling these bees but also increasing their toxicity. 
 Bees communicate by releasing pheromones. 
 Maybe this meta's controlling them through secretion? 
 Anyone want to join me in getting a beekeeper suit? 
 I'm pretty sure I can outrun a bee. 
 Just don't run into a lake. 
 Bees will wait for you to come up for air and then they'll sting you. 
 Discovery Channel. 
 Turns out there's a lot to discover. 
 Felicity, what are you doing here? 
 Can you guys come outside for a sec? 
 [gentle sweeping music] 
 What exactly are we waiting for, Ms. Smoak? 
 Up there. 
 Is that a bird? 
 It's a plane. 
 It's my boyfriend. 
 [sighs] Hi. 
 I'm Ray. 
 So he seems a little tall for you. 
 Barry Allen, are you jealous? 
 Je... no. No, I'm not jealous. 
 I just... I really wish you would've called before flying in. 
 Oh no, he flew. I drove. 
 I'm serious, all right? 
Now is not the best time. 
 Why? What's going on? 
 Ah, well, my ears popped, so that's something. 
 You're lucky you didn't break your neck. 
 What is it with billionaires being superheroes? 
 So have you... picked a name yet? 
 I'm kind of partial to The Atom. 
 Shoo. 
 You married to that, or...? 
 Your A.T.O.M. suit... it's quite the technological achievement, Mr. Palmer. 
 Wells : I'm impressed. 
 And he is never impressed. 
 Well, thank you, but I can't quite seem to keep it up. 
 Felicity : He means the suit. 
 Yeah, I mean the suit. 
 Yeah. 
 I can attest that everything else works just fine. 
 There's nothing we need to fix in... 
 [clicks tongue] That area. 
 No, no, no. The s*x is great. 
 God, there's two of them. 
 I know from Felicity that you have been very helpful with Barry and the Flash suit, and I was hoping to get another set of eyes on my... 
 Problem. 
 Problem. 
 Any friend of The Arrow's is a friend... 
 Hell, yes. 
 Uh, guys. 
 We kind of have a lot going on already. 
 There's the meta-human killer that can control a whole swarm of bees? 
 Cool. [chuckles] 
 I mean, awful. 
 I'm sure Caitlin and I will provide ample support, Barry. 
 And I will be happy to sit this one out. 
 You... 
 Ray, why don't you stay here and work on your suit while Barry and I run to Jitters for some java? 
 Sounds like a plan. 
 Coffee? 
 Sure. 
 [tense music] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Hey, Detective. 
 Iris. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I am following up on my story about crime in Central City. 
 Or lack thereof. 
 Could someone be working with The Flash? 
 No. Of course not. 
 You caught a flasher, armed robbers in a getaway car, and two jewelry thieves last night. 
 I'm just that good. 
 What is going on with you lately? 
 You've been acting really weird and withdrawn. 
 If I didn't know any better, I'd think that you were hiding something from me. 
 Iris, I'm... I'm not hiding anything from you. 
 [solemn music] 
 Do you ever go to work? 
 Oh, you're funny. 
 [laughs] 
 Okay, I can't keep lying to Iris about The Flash. 
 You have to. 
 It's really starting to affect our relationship. 
 We haven't had s*x in two weeks. 
 Which you didn't want to know about. 
 Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe. 
 I don't agree. 
 Well, I'm her father. 
 And I'm her boyfriend. 
 When does my vote outweigh yours? 
 When you become her husband. 
 You know I left Starling City to get away from the mood and brood, but it looks like it followed me here. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 It's like I said before, now is not the best time. 
 Barry, I have been through enough with you to know when you're holding something back. 
 Is this because I told Ray your secret? 
 Because he is trustworthy, Barry. 
 He wants to help people, just like you. 
 I know, that's not what I'm worried about. 
 It's... 
 I really don't want to put anyone else in danger. 
 In danger of what? 
 Barry, hey. 
 Eddie, hey. 
 You remember Felicity. 
 Of course. 
 Hey. 
 Great to see you. 
 Yeah. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 Is everyone in Central City in a bad mood? 
 I thought Central City was supposed to be the fun one. 
 It's, um... 
 It's not... 
 Felicity knows. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 So everyone but Iris. 
 It feels that way. 
 How do you lie to everyone you care about? 
 Felicity : For starters, don't think of it as lying. 
 Think of it as protecting her from getting hurt... with a fib. 
 But Iris can tell I'm hiding something, and it's putting this distance between us. 
 Felicity : I have an idea. 
 Why don't we all go to dinner tonight? 
 A little wine and dine is sure to bridge the gap. 
 Come on, we all had fun last time. 
 Sure. Why not? 
 Barry Allen, fifth wheel. 
 man : Well, I can't make my 3:00 meeting this afternoon. 
 Also, confirm my dinner reservation for tonight. 
 Last time, they couldn't find it, and that was unacceptable. Thanks. 
 [tense music] 
 You see that bad man over there? 
 [bee buzzing] 
 Tell your sisters it's time. 
 Cisco : So you put solid oxide fuel cells into the belt? 
 Yeah, it's the only place to hide the hardware. 
 Hmm, well, they should be generating enough energy to power the suit. 
 It could be the operating temperature. 
 I mean, you're essentially... 
 Overheating the system, yeah. I figured. 
 But if we insulate them with a ceramic compound... 
 We may improve the operating efficiency. 
 [chuckles] 
 You really are quite clever, Cisco. 
 Reverse-Flash voice-over : Some would say I'm the reverse. 
 [dramatic music] 
 You're incredibly clever, Cisco. 
 How do you turn this thing on? 
 Cisco? You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I haven't been getting enough sleep, so... 
 [alarm blaring] 
 Caitlin : Cisco, we need you up here. 
 [energetic music] 
 Killer bees are at it again. 
 Get a hold of Barry. 
 [phone vibrates] 
 Another bee attack. Folston Tech. 
 I'll see where Joe is. 
 Bee  careful. 
 For real? 
 Bad pun. Sorry. Just don't die. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [people screaming] 
 I'm too late. 
 Where are the bees? 
 I don't know. There's no sign of them. 
 [bees buzzing] 
 Found them. 
 Flash : How do I get out of here? 
 Take the northeast crossway. 
 It's the quickest way out of the building. 
 Guys, they're everywhere. I'm surrounded. 
 [siren wailing] 
 Barry! 
 Barry. 
 He's going into cardiac arrest. 
 [computer beeps] 
 Barry, stay with me. 
 Cisco! Barry doesn't have a pulse. 
 Step away from him. 
 What? Why? 
 We need to jumpstart his heart. 
 There's a defibrillator in the suit. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Caitlin : Charge it to 360 joules. 
 Charging in three, two, one. 
 [electricity sparks] 
 Hit him again. 400 joules. 
 Charging in three, two, one. 
 [gasps] 
 [coughing] 
 Barry. 
 [gasping] 
 Joe. 
 That is it for the defibrillator. 
 It is completely fried. 
 You're lucky to be alive, Mr. Allen. 
 I was very specific that you not die. 
 Yeah, that's a pretty big thing for her. 
 Cisco, what happened out there? 
 I followed your directions exactly. 
 I'm sorry. I led you the wrong way. 
 The schematics that we had, they... they weren't up to date. 
 Barry : What, they weren't up to date? 
 What do you mean? 
 That's never happened before. 
 What, you think Cisco was trying to get you killed? 
 No. Why would he do that? 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 I know. That's why I was joking. 
 Barry, it's our job to protect you, and today, we failed, but that'll just serve as a warning for all of us to be more vigilant in the future. 
 Caitlin : Good news... the apitoxin is out of your body. 
 Your levels are back to normal. 
 Terrific. 
 Ray, Felicity. We're gonna be late for dinner. 
 Are you sure that's wise, Barry? 
 You just died. 
 Maybe you should order in tonight. 
 Yeah, we could totally cancel. 
 I'm fine. Alive. Hungry. 
 All right? Let's go. 
 That was weird. 
 Yeah. 
 Why didn't we get invited to dinner? 
 [tense music] 
 [bee buzzing] 
 [upbeat music] 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Wow, Iris. Check you out. 
 [chuckles] Hi, Felicity. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. Guys, this is Ray Palmer. 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. 
 Lovely to meet you. 
 Hi, nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Barry. 
 Bienvenue chez Massimo Restaurant. 
 maitre d' : Mr. Palmer, your table is ready. 
 Great. Shall we? 
 Yes. 
 Hey, how did he get a reservation here? 
 We've been trying for months. 
 I don't know. 
 [laughs] 
 Here's your table, sir. 
 I thought it'd be nice if it was quiet, so I bought out the entire restaurant. 
 Too much? 
 Just a tad, sweetie. 
 Joe. 
 Oh, Cisco. Hey. 
 You just saved me a trip to S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 I got some info on our second victim. 
 Name's Bill Carlisle. 
 West : He was recently hired at Folston Tech to beef up their robotics division. 
 Robotics? 
 That's just like the first victim. 
 Wow. That is weird. 
 That's not why you stopped by. 
 No, I wanted to talk to you about Barry. 
 Okay. 
 [tense music] 
 Is there something going on with him? 
 Something he's not telling us? 
 What do you mean? 
 He hasn't really been himself lately. 
 Not that I'm aware of. 
 It's like something is just really bothering him. 
 Well, I think he's got his mind trained on catching the bad guys, Cisco. 
 And he's probably worried about when The Reverse-Flash is gonna show his face again. 
 Reverse-Flash voice-over : Oh, I'm not like The Flash at all. 
 Some would say I'm the reverse. 
 Hey. You okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine. 
 It's just... I've got this crazy headache. 
 Thank you for the file and the talk. 
 [solemn music] 
 So how did you two meet? 
 Work. 
 Well, actually, I bought the company where Felicity was employed, and so she was forced to join me at Palmer Tech. 
 It's not as creepy as it sounds. 
 So you two work closely together? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Interesting. 
 I guess you guys share all of your thoughts and feelings and... 
 Yeah...I share everything with Felicity. 
 It's nice that you guys have that level of communication. 
 
 
 
 [lounge music playing] 
 Oh, well, no, not every-everything. 
 I mean, sometimes it's good to just shut up. 
 [chuckles] 
 I get that. 
 Some things are better left unspoken. 
 Really? 
 I... I don't find that to be true. 
 Oh, thank God. It's the food. 
 Barry : Food's here. 
 Our first course on the tasting menu is a quail egg frittata. 
 Bon appetit. 
 Ray : Barry. [chuckles] 
 I got to admit, I envy you spending so much time at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 Harrison Wells is, like, a personal hero of mine. 
 I mean, it's amazing just to actually be in the same room with him. 
 [voices and music echoing] 
 I'll be right back. Just excuse me. 
 Okay. 
 [tense music] 
 Well, I, um... have to pee. 
 Okay, you've been acting super strange ever since Ray and I got to Central City. 
 What is going on with you? 
 And don't say it's a bad time. 
 Oliver might be joining the League of Assassins, Laurel's the Black Canary, and Thea's training with Malcolm, so I know about bad times. 
 Okay. 
 Joe and I found out that Wells isn't who he says he is. 
 He... [sighs] 
 He is the man that killed my mother. 
 Oh, my God. But he's been helping you. 
 Get faster, stronger. I know. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know anything anymore, especially who I can and can't trust. 
 So you think Cisco and Caitlin are helping him? 
 That's impossible. 
 Is it? 
 Yes. 
 They were trying to save you today, Barry. 
 They did save you. 
 Wells has also saved me. 
 Many times. 
 I thought that Wells was a great man, and I was so wrong about him. 
 What if I'm wrong about everything else too? 
 [door clicks] 
 Hey, guys. 
 Uh, things are getting a little intense in here. 
 [both chuckle] 
 Please can't we just have a nice evening? 
 Okay, so it's my fault that we're not having a nice evening? 
 I am your girlfriend. Who you live with. 
 I shouldn't have to beg you to talk to me. 
 If I could talk to you about this, I would, believe me. 
 But I can't. 
 You know what? I am not hungry anymore. 
 Iris. 
 You know what? 
 When you are ready to act like we are two people who love each other, call me. 
 I'll be at my dad's. 
 [somber music] 
 Thank you for dinner. I've got to go. 
 [phone vibrating] 
 Uh, emergency at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 Go. 
 Sorry. 
 [chuckles] 
 Well, only 17 more courses to go. 
 male voice : Containment breach. Foreign object detected. 
 [shouts] 
 Did I get it? 
 I think I got it. 
 Where is he? 
 [buzzing] 
 [buzzing silences] 
 Thank you. 
 Let's see what makes this bee so poisonous. 
 [groans] 
 You saved my life. 
 That is one odd-looking bee. 
 Cisco : That's 'cause it isn't a bee at all. 
 It's a robot. 
 No way. 
 Unbelievable. 
 This bot's got a 360-degree vision system. 
 I mean, we're talking multiple micro-cameras all coming from various angles at the same time. 
 Which means... 
 It can see all around the room at once. 
 That is... 
 both : Amazing. 
 Disturbing. 
 It's also next-gen hardware that nowhere near the market. 
 So we're not dealing with a meta-human? 
 It's just a mad scientist. 
 Cisco, you said the second victim, Bill Carlisle, was a robotics engineer. 
 Let's cross-reference his previous employers with those of Lindsay Kang. 
 Allow me. 
 Mama's been away from a keyboard for far too long. 
 Okay. 
 [solemn music] 
 They both worked at Mercury Labs. 
 Let's call Joe. 
 I think it's time we paid a visit to an old friend. 
 McGee : Twice in one year, Harrison. 
 You really are vying for comeback scientist of the year. 
 Always a pleasure, Christina. 
 To what do I owe this visit? 
 Did you finally find my tachyon prototype, or are you here to blackmail me for another one? 
 Do you have another one? 
 West : We came here for information. 
 Bill Carlisle and Lindsay Kang. 
 Former employees who were recently murdered. 
 My God. I wasn't aware. 
 Stung to death by robotic bees. 
 You're looking for Brie Larvan. 
 Brie Larvan? 
 A quite brilliant roboticist who once developed miniature mechanical bees for agricultural use. 
 Kang and Carlisle warned me that Brie was weaponizing the bees for military use, so I terminated her. 
 Well, it seems that you would be on her hit list too, Doctor. 
 You've got to let us keep you safe. 
 [chuckles] 
 I'm all too familiar with your inability to protect things, Harrison. 
 I can ta care of myself. 
 Good day, gentlemen. 
 Thank you. 
 [soft pop music playing] 
 Hey. 
 Okay, so we found our queen bee. 
 Brie Larvan. She's a roboticist. 
 Joe is running a trace on her current location, but so far nothing. 
 [clears throat] Good. 
 Where is Ray? 
 Oh, he's working on his suit with Cisco. 
 I like Ray. 
 He seems like he's a really good guy. 
 He is a good guy. 
 Just like Cisco. 
 And Caitlin. Girl. 
 Is that why you called me here? 
 I know that you're in a tricky situation, but that's when you need your friends to have your back. 
 And how can they if you won't let them? 
 It's not that simple. 
 What if Joe is right, and I tell them, and it backfires? 
 Wells isn't just their boss, Felicity. 
 He is their mentor, their hero. 
 [sighs] My hero. 
 Look, it's... 
 I don't know what to do. 
 [sighs] 
 When I first met Oliver, before I knew he was The Arrow, he would... he would ask me to do weird things for him like decrypt a bullet-ridden computer or hack some company. 
 And when I would ask him why, he would come up these ridiculous excuses. 
 And I always knew he was lying, but I would help him anyway. 
 You know why? 
 Hmm? 
 Because I knew Oliver was a good person with a good heart. 
 And Cisco and Caitlin? 
 They're no different. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So you're really staying here tonight? 
 Tonight. Tomorrow night. 
 The night after that. 
 Do you think that Eddie is cheating on me? 
 No. Eddie's not that kind of guy. 
 Well, then I don't know what else he could be hiding from me. 
 Iris... 
 Remember when we were kids, and Joe would come home from work with that blank expression on his face? 
 [chuckles] Yeah. 
 The "Earth to Joe" look. 
 How could I forget? 
 Barry : I never understood that look until I started working for the CCPD. 
 Showing up at crime scenes and seeing someone murdered... it can be ugly work. 
 Barry : And I'm lucky. 
 I get to hide behind the science of it and just stay in my lab, but Eddie, he's out there every day in the darkness. 
 I just... I think that maybe if he doesn't want to talk to you about his work, it's probably because he wants to keep you in the light. 
 What? 
 I'm just surprised. 
 You going out of your way like this to help me see Eddie's point of view. 
 I mean... 
 Eddie makes you happy. 
 All I ever want is for you to be happy, Iris. 
 Welcome home. 
 [chuckles] 
 It is so fun to watch grown men play with their toys. 
 Caitlin : You're so lucky. 
 Ray is so nice and smart and hot. 
 Yeah, it's kind of like I'm dating Barry but in Oliver's body. 
 A sentence you will never repeat to anyone. 
 Your secret's safe with me. 
 [bee buzzing] 
 It must have re-activated. 
 And if it's being controlled wirelessly... 
 I can trace its signal and figure out where it's trying to go. 
 [tense music] 
 Oh, no. 
 Oh, boy. 
 What? 
 The swarm is headed for Mercury Labs. 
 Brie Larvan's going after Tina. 
 [tense music] 
 [swarm buzzing] 
 Hello, Dr. McGee. 
 You gonna open the window, or should I buzz myself in? 
 How do we stop them? 
 Wells : She's got to be remotely piloting those bees from somewhere. 
 We need to stop this bug-eyed glasses woman. 
 And her mini bandits. 
 Bug-Eyed Bandit. 
 Bug-Eyed Bandit. 
 Felicity : Got her. She's in an abandoned greenhouse. 
 Barry, you have to take out Brie. 
 It's the only way to stop these nanodrones. 
 What about Dr. McGee? 
 The defibrillator in your suit is broken. 
 You cannot risk going near Mercury Labs. 
 Bees can't penetrate my suit. 
 I'll go. 
 Whoa. 
 We haven't tested out the new power system yet. 
 We'll do it now. 
 I'm following you. 
 I'm driving. 
 Felicity : And I'm kissing you. 
 [heroic music] 
 Dr. Wells... 
 Mr. Palmer will protect Tina. Go. 
 [dramatic music] 
 You fired me, destroyed years of my research. 
 You took everything from me. 
 What you were doing was wrong. 
 You wanted to harm people, not help them. 
 I did what I had to do. 
 You wanted to harm people, You mean ruin my life? 
 Sure. 
 Now I'm doing what I have to do. 
 [buzzing] 
 [electronics beeping] 
 Found her. 
 Felicity, can you jam their frequency? 
 I already tried, but I might be able to redirect them onto a new target. 
 Felicity : Ray, get ready for incoming. 
 We have the technology. 
 It's over, Brie. 
 Flash : I know you're trying to kill Dr. McGee. 
 You think that she betrayed you. 
 I can imagine how that feels. 
 You think you understand the sting of betrayal? 
 I'll show you what it means to be stung. 
 [swarm buzzing] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Barry. 
 Barry, I hacked into the bees' frequency. 
 I'm controlling them. 
 I'm the queen of this hive. 
 Oh, she's good. 
 She's like my nemesis. 
 I've never had a nemesis before. I kind of like it. 
 [swarm buzzing] 
 Okay, Cisco. Now what? 
 Cisco : Ray, get to the ocean. 
 If the bots follow you into the water, their electronics will fry. 
 Got it. 
 Wait. But so will my suit. 
 [swarm buzzing] 
 [heroic music] 
 [electricity crackling] 
 Cisco, I'm fried. I'm losing propulsion control. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Can you see the van? 
 [electronics beeping] 
 Yeah. 
 We'll catch you. 
 You will? 
 We will? 
 We will. 
 All right. 
 Keep it steady! 
 [groans] 
 Whoo! 
 The Atom lives. 
 [chuckling] 
 [groans] 
 Oh. 
 Let's work on some softer gloves for next time, okay? 
 Sorry. 
 Oh, you want to bring it? 
 It's been brought. 
 [yelps] 
 Rude. 
 Felicity, right now would be a good time to do something. 
 Stay away from Barry Allen. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Felicity! 
 Got it. 
 Boom. Drop the mic. 
 It's metaphorical, of course, because I don't have a real mic. 
 Brie's restrained. 
 Call CCPD. 
 Ah. Some kind of team you have here. 
 Helps to have friends in your corner. 
 [buzzing] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [bee buzzing] 
 [gasping] 
 Are you okay? 
 Cisco! 
 Come on. Please. 
 Wake up. 
 Cisco's been stung. He's going into shock. 
 Flash : I'm on my way. 
 Come on, stay with me. 
 Hold on. Back up. 
 I'm gonna try something. 
 [electricity crackling] 
 Cisco. 
 [gasps] 
 Either my fear of bees is over or it just got a lot worse. 
 Thank God you're okay. 
 I've never had anybody take a bee for me. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome, bro. 
 Cisco, you're a hero, man. 
 Dr. McGee. 
 May I come in? 
 Yeah, of course. What can I do for you? 
 I wanted to apologize. 
 McGee : I should have listened to you when you warned me about Brie. 
 Perhaps next time I will take the CCPD's offer of protection. 
 After we lost your tachyon prototype, I can understand why you were hesitant to trust us. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 I couldn't help but notice some tension between you and Dr. Wells. 
 That's all in the past. 
 Do you mind if I ask what happened between you two? 
 I ask myself that same question all the time. 
 15 years ago, Harrison and I were thick as thieves. 
 We were promising young scientists in Starling City. 
 He was such a kind man. 
 Then everything changed after Tess died. 
 They were gonna get married? 
 I understand how grief can affect someone, but this was more than that. 
 It was like, after that day, Harrison Wells became a completely different person. 
 Good day. 
 Bye. 
 Doctor. 
 How's Cisco? 
 Happy to be alive. 
 And sad that Ray is leaving. 
 It was a really brave thing he did, risking his life. 
 Barry : Selfless. 
 Yeah. It definitely was. 
 [upbeat music] 
 And another end to another exciting adventure in Central City. 
 Ah, yes, thank you. 
 Ray, thank you for all your help. 
 Oh. 
 And I hope you figure out the problem with your suit. 
 I already have, actually. 
 Oh. 
 All this time, I've been looking at the power source the wrong way. 
 I kept thinking we needed to go bigger. 
 But the solution, as always, is simply to go smaller. 
 Oh. Great. 
 [chuckles] 
 You okay? 
 Mm-hmm. I'm gonna be. 
 Thank you for your advice. 
 I won't even charge you the 5Â¢. 
 [sighs] Bye, Felicity. 
 Bye, Barry. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 I, um... 
 I spoke to Barry last night. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 He was trying to help me understand why you've been so off lately, why you might be having trouble connecting with me. 
 Really? 
 What did he say? 
 It was a good explanation. 
 Valid. 
 But the truth is, it doesn't matter, because when you love someone, you tell them everything. 
 So if you love me, Eddie, you'll tell me what is going on with you, or... 
 Or what? 
 You know what. 
 [solemn music] 
 All right, all right, who's ready for some... 
 ♪ Karaoke ♪ 
 We are not going to karaoke, are we? 
 No. 
 This is everything we know about my mother's murder and The Reverse-Flash. 
 I've been gathering information on him for a long time. 
 And this is everything we know about Dr. Wells. 
 [tense music] 
 I don't understand. 
 What do Dr. Wells and The Reverse-Flash have to do with each other? 
 Um... 
 They're the same person. 
 That's impossible. 
 Look, Caitlin, it took me a long time to believe it too, but it's him. 
 Dr. Wells is a speedster? 
 He's paralyzed. 
 Is he, though? 
 And why would he kill Barry's mother? 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 Cisco. Say something. 
 I've been having these dreams. 
 Mostly at night, but sometimes during the day. 
 But they don't really feel like dreams. 
 They... They feel real. 
 What happens in the dream? 
 Dr. Wells is The Reverse-Flash. 
 And... he kills me.
