 My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. And one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am The Flash. 
 Previously on The Flash... 
 West : That's Barry's old house. 
 Maybe it's been too long. Everything's different. 
 Except that mirror. 
 Cisco : This mirror might contain photographs of what happened that night. 
 That blood belongs to one of the two speedsters that was here that night. 
 It's Barry's... As an adult. 
 Mrs. Stein, have you seen this person? 
 Yes. 
 He's not even Ronnie anymore. 
 He's Martin Stein walking around in Ronnie's body. 
 Any attempt we make to separate the two of them could be catastrophic and nuclear. 
 Barry? 
 Barry, what happened out there? 
 Are you guys okay? 
 Are you okay? 
 I think so. 
 I think so. 
 Oh, God. The nuclear explosion. 
 There's no telling how much radiation we were exposed to. 
 Wait... wait, wait, wait, wait, this can't be. 
 The Geiger counter in the suit... it's reading less than one millirad. 
 But that's normal. 
 Wells : There's no radiation. 
 Let's go. 
 Cisco : Did it work? 
 Did you separate them? 
 I don't know. 
 Ronnie? 
 Tell me your name. 
 Ronnie Raymond. 
 Cait. 
 It's me. 
 Uh, pardon me. 
 Obviously, I need a change of clothes. 
 Nice to see you in the flesh again, Professor Stein. 
 We're coming home. 
 All of us. 
 Ronnie Raymond. 
 Cisco. 
 Man. Ohh. 
 I missed you so much, man. 
 I shouldn't have locked you in there. 
 Hey... don't. 
 Welcome back, Mr. Raymond. 
 Dr. Wells. 
 Caitlin told me what happened to you. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm responsible for putting myself in this chair. 
 You are responsible for my still being alive... thank you. 
 You said you'd bring him back, and you did. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Excuse me? 
 Are we all planning to sing Kumbaya next? 
 Professor Stein, I presume. 
 Harrison Wells. 
 Do you have somewhere I can freshen up and get a change of clothes? 
 Of course. 
 Right this way, Professor. 
 Bates : General, are you getting this? 
 Roger that, Sergeant. 
 Sir, look at this. 
 Two imprints of impact. 
 Two imprints. 
 Eiling : Two different people. 
 It's Firestorm. He's separated. 
 Your vitals appear to be normal, except you have a slight fever of 100.6. 
 Cait, I'm fine, I promise. 
 I know, but we just need to be... 
 Shh. 
 Yep... just when I forgot how awkward it was to walk in on you two. 
 Well, you can get used to it again. 
 So I did a full medical workup on the Professor. 
 It turns out that now that he and Ronnie are separated, they no longer possess the ability to harness nuclear energy. 
 Professor Stein, you seem to be running a little hot as well. 
 Same as Ronnie... 100.6. 
 Hardly a sweat, Dr. Snow. 
 And hopefully now the only thing Ronald and I have in common... 
 It's Ronnie. 
 Mm. 
 Hey? 
 You gonna miss being able to fly? 
 Yeah, maybe if I was the one holding the controller. 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning, you weren't the most conscientious body-mate. 
 So you do not consider keeping you alive to be conscientious? 
 Alive? 
 We were living under a bridge, eating garbage. 
 I did not determine that it would be my mind that would dominate our existence, but thank God it was. 
 I could feel your fear and panic, emotions that likely would have gotten us killed in that state. 
 You kept me buried down. 
 You kept me from her. 
 Which is likely why she's still alive. 
 Now I believe you and I have spent quite enough time together. 
 Yeah. 
 I would like to go home to see my wife. 
 Mr. Allen will take you. 
 Thank you. 
 I need some pizza. 
 You got it. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Oh... wait. 
 Uh... what should I say? 
 I don't think you're gonna have to say anything. 
 Oh, Clarissa. 
 I'm so sorry I put you through this. 
 [mouthing] Thank you. 
 Mister, uh... Barry. 
 Yeah? 
 Barry, I... I know I can be difficult, but thank you for bringing me home. 
 I'll see you soon, Professor. 
 Hey. 
 I left you three messages. 
 Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. 
 About the lack of communication, or that new hole out in the badlands? 
 Uh, we're all fine, thanks. 
 I wasn't calling about the explosion. 
 I have to show you something. 
 What? 
 It's smaller than I remember. 
 Yeah. 
 It's because you're bigger. 
 Have you been in here? 
 I mean, recently. 
 No. 
 I haven't been in this house since that night. 
 Bar? This mirror... you remember it? 
 Yeah. It belonged to my grandma. 
 How is it still here? 
 Just be glad it is. 
 Look... I don't fully know how Cisco did it, but... 
 Did what Joe, what are we doing here? 
 Mom. 
 You can definitely see two very fast people fighting around your mother. 
 Two speedsters. 
 You see that? 
 The blood? 
 Cisco and I had the DNA tested. 
 It's yours. 
 No, it's not. That's impossible. 
 I wasn't even downstairs yet. 
 No, Barry. Not that you. 
 This you. 
 Cisco had the samples analyzed and the proteins in the blood were that of an adult, not a child. 
 But that means... 
 The second speedster, the one trying to stop the man in yellow... 
 Is the Flash. 
 That's me. 
 Time travel. 
 If the last five months have proven anything, it's that anything can exist, but to actually travel through time? 
 Well, the greatest minds in human history put their collective genius towards solving that puzzle. 
 So. Is it possible? 
 Yes, it's possible. 
 But problematic. 
 Assuming you could create the conditions necessary to take that journey... well, that journey would then befraught with potential pitfalls. 
 The Novikov principle of self-consistency, for example. 
 Wait, the what, now? 
 If you travel back in time to change something, then you end up being the causal factor of that event. 
 Like  Terminator. 
 Ah. 
 Or is time plastic? 
 Is it mutable whereby any changes to the continuum could create an alternate timeline. 
 Back To The Future. 
 Oh... saw that one too. 
 Doc Brown. Tremendous picture. 
 Right. So what's the answer? 
 I might be a clever guy, Joe, but if you're asking me to give you a working theory on how to travel through time, I'm afraid I just can't do that. 
 There is someone else you can talk to about this. 
 Danish? 
 Why do you have a blueprint of the S.T.A.R. Labs Particle Accelerator? 
 Do you actually know anything about physics? 
 Not a thing. Might as well be in Dothraki. 
 So what more is there with the S.T.A.R. Labs story? 
 The only new piece of information is the fact that Harrison Wells admitted that he was warned of a potential disaster. 
 Yeah. Why do you think he did that? 
 Because he's a good person? 
 Is he? 
 Yes. 
 He saved my friend's life. 
 He was struck by lightning that night and Dr. Wells and his team kept him alive. 
 So? 
 Your friend wouldn't have needed saving if Wells hadn't zapped him in the first place. 
 It was an accident. 
 What if it wasn't? 
 So you think Harrison Wells wanted the Particle Accelerator to explode? 
 Why would he do that? 
 I don't know what goes on inside that building. 
 But I think you know some people who do. 
 So you think I would investigate my friends because you got me a danish? 
 I think that you'll do it because you really want to know what goes on inside that building. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Harry? 
 Mrs. Stein, I'm sorry to bother you here, but is Professor Stein here right now? 
 Well, after a year apart, I'm not letting him out of my sight. 
 S.T.A.R. Labs did quite a few tests on Martin, didn't they... and they said he was fine? 
 Yeah. Why, is something wrong? 
 He just seems a little different, is all. 
 Different how? 
 He's been asking for pizza. Martin despises pizza. 
 Is that the delivery man? Oh, Mr. Allen. 
 I suppose it's too much to hope you moonlight as a pizza boy. I am famished. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, bravo! Please, come in. 
 Mr. Allen. 
 Oh, mmm. What can I do for you? 
 I... I needed to talk to you about a paper that you wrote 25 years ago for the Oxford University Press. 
 I've written many papers for that publication. 
 Could you be more specific about the subject matter? 
 Time travel. 
 These are just a few of the random thoughts I've had on the subject. 
 Few? 
 See, I believe that space-time is a free-flowing highway that intersects the physical world. 
 We live in... in the moments between the on and off ramps. 
 Theoretically, to travel through time, one merely needs to find a way onto the highway. 
 Okay, so... so you're saying that this is actually possible to... to travel into the future? 
 Undoubtedly. 
 What about the past? 
 Yes. 
 My own personal choice would be the Chicago World's Fair, 1893. 
 I... I think Nicola Tesla and I would have some wonderful arguments. 
 What about you? 
 Would you be interested in taking a trip into history? 
 I think that I already have. 
 Professor, um... 
 15 years ago, my mom was murdered and we recently discovered some evidence that... 
 I was there that night, and not just as a kid, but as an adult. 
 That must be a side effect of your incredible speed. 
 In some... future date, you actually move so fast that the resulting kinetic energy buildup smashes a hole in the space-time continuum! 
 You seem disappointed by the prospect. 
 I mean, if I do somehow make it back there to that night, then... it means that I didn't save her. 
 My destiny is to fail. 
 And the boomerang goes flying through the cortex, smashing everything and Cisco's all, “My bad. This one's on me.” 
 Sounds like you had some crazy times. 
 Yeah, we have. 
 Are you ready for life to get back to normal? 
 What do you mean? 
 I was thinking we could leave town. 
 Start fresh somewhere. 
 Our lives are here. My job is here. 
 Yeah, hunting meta-humans. 
 There's more to it than that. 
 And it's dangerous. 
 It can be. 
 Look, I stayed at S.T.A.R. Labs because I believed in Dr. Wells. 
 But ever since Barry became The Flash and we've been working to keep this city safe, I found a new way to help people. 
 Look, Cait, I'm not mad at anyone. 
 Okay, I know the accelerator explosion was an accident. 
 But that building took a year of our lives. 
 I don't want it to take anymore. 
 Do you guys need anything else? We're about to close up. 
 I'm good. Babe? 
 Ronnie, get down. 
 Get out of here. 
 No, not without you. 
 I'm right behind you... go! 
 Professor? 
 Martin? 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't know, I... I feel terrified. 
 My... my heart is racing. 
 Man : Hands in the air! 
 I think... I think Ronald is in trouble. 
 How could you know that? 
 Jitters. He needs help. 
 Go! 
 
 
 
 Ronald Raymond. 
 Burning Man himself. 
 Half of him, anyway. 
 Who are you? 
 General Wade Eiling, United States Army. 
 What do you want? 
 Firestorm. 
 [screams in pain] 
 Stings, doesn't it? 
 Had that one developed especially for you. 
 Micro fragments attracted to kinetic energy. 
 Firestorm was tonight's main objective, but getting you... that's just gravy. 
 Get in! 
 Gentlemen, we are at war. 
 You need to hurry, Barry's wounds are starting to heal with the fragments still under his skin. 
 This is just like that time I stepped on a sea urchin. 
 Only much worse. 
 Just don't pee on me. 
 Uh, you know that's a myth, right? 
 [yells] 
 I'm so stupid. 
 Jason Rush, the grad student who was helping Professor Stein with his Firestorm research, he said that the army took all of Professor Stein's material when he disappeared. 
 I should have known it was General Eiling. 
 Not your fault. 
 He still thinks you hold the keys to the ultimate human weapon... both of you. 
 Okay, let's just finish this. I gotta get to Stein's house. 
 Eiling's gonna be after him too. 
 Stein's fine. 
 How do you know? 
 He's right there. 
 I don't think Mr. Raymond and I are as distinctive as we had hoped. 
 I'm still inside Ronald. 
 There has to be a better way to phrase that. 
 Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta... all your brain waves are perfectly in sync. 
 The chances of that happening are next to impossible. 
 Impossible's just another Tuesday for us, remember? 
 Yeah, but this is like some  Twilight Zone  level stuff, and I say that knowing full well that we have a guy locked up in our basement who can turn himself into poison gas. 
 Wait, really? 
 Dude, that was, like, week three. 
 Look, if this Eiling is as dangerous as you say, then I need to warn Clarissa. 
 I promise, I can get Clarissa out of the city in time, but we need you to stay here. 
 Professor, I need you to trust us. 
 Very well. 
 Hey. Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it's just not the S.T.A.R. Labs I knew. 
 Ronnie, this isn't the world that you knew. 
 Tell me about it. 
 All right, here we are. 
 Uh, all right. 
 You guys can stay down in Iris' old room. 
 It's kind of small, but... 
 Hey. 
 We have guests. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 I hope that's okay. 
 Mi casa. 
 This is Ronnie. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Ronnie, the... 
 Dead fiance. 
 Right. 
 Beer? 
 Thanks. 
 Dad? Barry? 
 Iris, hi. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Uh, it's Tuesday. 
 I was gonna make us dinner, remember? 
 Yep. 
 Yeah. 
 Here, I'll help. Got it. 
 I knew you'd forget. 
 Well, there's plenty for everyone. 
 Caitlin, what brings you by? 
 There's a gas leak in my apartment, so Barry said that we could stay here. 
 Oh, that's sweet of him. And, uh, who's this? 
 This is, uh... 
 Her cousin. 
 Sam. 
 Visiting from Coast City. 
 You look really familiar, Sam. 
 Yeah, I... I have... one of those faces. 
 So what's for dinner? 
 Harrison. 
 Wade. 
 I had a feeling you would be wheeling by. 
 Tell me. 
 They still pulling needles out of Barry Allen's hide? 
 I guess your sweet little Flash didn't want Sergeant Sans Soucie to die looking into a mask. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't see you. 
 I don't know how Firestorm works. 
 Well, you may not know the how, but you know the who. 
 Both of them. 
 Thanks to you, it's the dawn of a new age, Harrison. 
 Cold War, the war on terror. 
 We'll seem like cave men fighting with sticks once those two freaks bind together. 
 Well, you know where to find me when you've come to the right decision. 
 And I know you will. 
 After all, you're the smartest guy I know. 
 Bar? 
 Should I have not shown you? 
 No, I had to know. 
 We have been through so much. You have... all your life. 
 And you've been so strong. 
 But I am still your guardian, and it's my job to guard you, not just physically, but from heartache. 
 I can't help but feeling like I just handed you a brand new burden. 
 Yeah. But it's our burden, right? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Hey, can I ask you something? 
 Mm hmm. 
 How did you know that the blood in the house belonged to me? 
 You would have had to have tested it specifically. 
 Cisco tested it against everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells? 
 Joe. 
 Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder. 
 You believe that now? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah... I do. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 Delicious. 
 This is quite an impressive facility. 
 Well, it was. 
 Now it's just a shell, I'm afraid. 
 Must have been devastating, seeing your life's work fall to pieces before your eyes. 
 It was and yet, it was the exact same moment your life's work came to fruition. 
 My life's work? 
 If living the last 14 months as a conjoined meta-human has taught me anything, it's that my life's work should have been being the best husband I could to my wife. 
 Are you all right, Martin? 
 I apologize, it's just... 
 I feel a little light-headed. 
 [glass shattering] 
 Are you okay? 
 Uh...yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. 
 Just got a little dizzy for a second. 
 You want the secret to Firestorm. 
 He has it. 
 See, Harrison? We do work well together. 
 Oh, hey... hey. 
 You said you knew some of the leftover scientists at the S.T.A.R. Lab. 
 What about a Caitlin Snow, M.D. You know her? 
 Yeah, I know her, why? 
 There was an incident at a local coffee shop. 
 She was there. 
 That's Jitters. I used to work there. 
 Is there anything you can't do? 
 Gimme this. 
 Witnesses swear they saw soldiers shooting the place up, so I contacted the Army's media relations division and asked, “Are soldiers permitted to operate like that on U.S. soil?” 
 You know what they told me? 
 Hooah. 
 That's weird, Caitlin didn't mention anything the last time I saw her. 
 Really? 
 When and where was that? 
 Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's an explanation for all of this. 
 He didn't hurt you? 
 Barry, I told you... only my pride is hurt. 
 Unfortunately, I'm not in the position to take on armed soldiers. 
 Where do you think Eiling took Professor Stein? 
 I imagine some off-the-books military research facility. 
 We have to get him back. 
 Easy... Eiling has already demonstrated he has the weaponry to disable The Flash, or worse. 
 Well, we can't let him turn Stein into a weapon. 
 How do we find him? 
 What? 
 No abnormal brain activity. 
 All vitals steady. 
 You really think Ronnie can somehow feel where they're keeping Stein? 
 Ronnie got dizzy when the soldiers grabbed Stein, and Stein developed Ronnie's obsession with pizza. 
 I don't feel anything right now. 
 Just keep trying. 
 Whatever this is, it doesn't have an on and off switch. 
 It's possible it's just some kind of residual connection. 
 A temporary link to your time together. 
 Wait. I feel something. 
 I'm... I'm cold. 
 It's freezing in here! 
 My apologies. It should warm up pretty quick. 
 I know what you want. 
 But my research was never intended to be used as a weapon. 
 I joined the military when I was 20 years old, Professor. 
 My father had me convinced that our greatest threat was the Soviets. 
 Our greatest fear... nuclear war. 
 Then came terrorism and Ebola. 
 And now, it's the age of Firestorm. 
 Soldiers enhanced by your project, Professor. 
 Soldiers who can generate energy blasts with their bare hands. 
 Soldiers who can fly. 
 I would gladly die before I see my life's work perverted in this way. 
 Good. Because you will die, Professor. 
 How soon I let that happen, though, is entirely up to you. 
 What's going on? 
 Last time I did this was to a gorilla. 
 [screams] 
 [screams] 
 You're okay, man, we got you. 
 What's happening to him? 
 Nothing's happening to him. 
 It's happening to Stein, and Ronnie is feeling his pain. 
 I was wrong. 
 The connection's not temporary. 
 It's only getting stronger. 
 Just try and hold on. 
 Water. Water. 
 My, my, my, my, my, my. 
 You show remarkable grit for a teacher. 
 I am impressed. 
 Why don't we let you catch your breath? 
 Think about how much more of this you want to endure. 
 Hmm? 
 Ronnie, no! 
 Wait, Cait, wait. 
 He's cutting himself. 
 I know. Let him. 
 Ronald. 
 [taps] 
 Anything? 
 Nothing. Nothing, just...just cold. 
 Like a metal surface. Pressure on and on and off. 
 Tap, tap. Tap. 
 Tap. Tap. 
 Tap, tap, tap. 
 Morse code. 
 I got this. 
 Same thing again. Tap, tap. 
 Tap. 
 Tap, tap, tap. 
 27. 
 What does it mean? 
 Army bases... they sometimes go by numbers, like Area 51. 
 Facility 27, about 300 miles away. 
 It was shut down in 1961. 
 Well, that's where they're keeping Stein. 
 Bet you that's where they're keeping aliens too. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No, you're not. 
 You can't. 
 I'm connected to Stein. I have to go. 
 But did you ever stop to think why your connection to him is growing stronger by the minute? 
 Maybe you're being drawn back together. 
 Maybe your proximity will cause you to re-merge into one. 
 And what happens to me if he gets killed? 
 Cait, Barry was right. 
 The world is different now. 
 Look, I... I thought we could get away, start a new life, a normal life, together. 
 But there is no normal life for us. 
 You will always risk your life to try and help people, and I will always be the guy that runs into that pipeline for you. 
 The quantum splicer. 
 It was used to separate you once. 
 Maybe it could be of use to keep you you. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Wait. 
 Come back. All three of you. 
 Let's go. 
 Oh. 
 This place definitely doesn't look too shady. 
 Stein's inside. 
 I can feel our connection growing stronger, like he's pulling me. 
 It's as I feared... the Firestorm matrix is building toward a proximity reemergence. 
 Like all matter, it yearns to be whole. 
 If you do merge... we might not be able to separate you again. 
 We've been able to isolate the Firestorm matrix inside the subject's cellular structure. 
 Excellent. 
 Professor Stein, I'm afraid you have made a terrible assumption... 
 That I need you alive. 
 Eiling has a gun to Stein's head. 
 He's about to pull the trigger. 
 He's here. 
 Ho! 
 Whoa... I never thought I'd be happy to see you. 
 Yeah, likewise. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 [screams] 
 Run! 
 Okay... come on, come on. 
 Barry, I'm picking up some serious pH numbers on your suit. 
 They hit me with some kind of chemical. 
 Cisco : It's a weaponized phosphorous. 
 Water or foam won't extinguish it. 
 But you can't burn in a vacuum, so you need to create one. 
 Run, Barry. Run! 
 We need to merge again. 
 Ronnie, no! 
 Cait, we're dead if we don't. 
 Listen to me. 
 The last time you two combined, you both fought it. 
 This time, don't. 
 Accept the change, accept the balance. 
 Accept each other. 
 Once more unto the breach, dear friend. 
 Cait... whatever happens, just remember I'll always love you. 
 Stein : Can you hear me, Ronald? 
 Professor? 
 Stein : It appears we merged properly on this attempt. 
 Wells was right about balance and accepting. 
 Behind you! 
 Stein : Ronald, there's more of them. 
 Eiling, this ends now. 
 Yes, it does... 
 For both of you. 
 An ion grenade. 
 Just bombarded your cellular structure with enough ions to destabilize your matrix. 
 Mr. Raymond, Professor Stein, you're both fine Americans. 
 Your country thanks you for your sacrifice. 
 That was a lot of running. 
 Ronnie? 
 Home? 
 Yeah. 
 I think it looks worse than it is. 
 Ronnie or Stein? 
 It's me, Cait. 
 [Stein clearing throat] Excuse me. 
 It's both of us. Somehow. 
 Stein : She's quite lovely. 
 Acceptance is a powerful thing. 
 Powerful enough to reverse it? 
 Stein : I'm game if you are, Mr. Raymond. 
 We could try. 
 I think we're getting the hang of this quite nicely. 
 It's okay. 
 I understand. You have to go. 
 How'd you know? 
 I'm connected to you too. 
 Where will you go? 
 Pittsburgh, maybe. 
 Professor Stein has a colleague he thinks can help us learn more about our abilities. 
 We can help you here too. 
 Eiling has already breached S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 We need to stay one step ahead of him... for all of us. 
 I'm coming back. 
 We'll have pizza. 
 Godspeed, Mr. Allen. 
 You too. 
 As to our earlier conversation, I believe in second chances. 
 You'll get yours. 
 Give it time. 
 Ready, Ronald? 
 Please stop calling me that. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 We love you. 
 I had Ronnie, then I lost him. 
 Then I found him again, but he wasn't actually Ronnie. 
 Then I got him back but just for a day until I lost him again. 
 You guys are like 10 seasons of Ross and Rachel, but just, like, smushed into one year. 
 I am not heartbroken this time. 
 I love Ronnie. I always will, but there's not this devastating hole inside me. 
 I have a life, and it's a good one. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Iris, hi. 
 Hi. 
 Where is your cousin? 
 Uh, he went home. 
 Oh. Uh, where was that again? 
 Uh, Midway. 
 Oh, I thought you said Coast City. 
 Uh, Midway via Coast City. 
 He moved around a lot. 
 That's always really hard. 
 All right, well. Enjoy. 
 Bye. 
 See you. 
 Am I supposed to know what that means? 
 It means that I'm gonna help you figure out what's going on at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 I think our Burning Man used to work there. 
 [door bell rings] 
 Yo. 
 Hey. 
 So why'd you bring me here? 
 I don't know how and I don't know when, but one day soon, I'm gonna be in this house again, 15 years ago. 
 And I'm gonna fail... 
 Unless this time, I don't. 
 What are you saying? 
 Knowing that I'm supposed to lose gives me the advantage. 
 Those images are a lesson in what not to do. 
 When I face off against the man in yellow, I won't make the same mistake twice. 
 You're gonna... change the past? 
 Joe... I'm gonna save my mom. 
 [electric buzzing] 
 What... what the hell was that? 
 distorted voice : It's good to see you again, General. 
 Who are you? 
 distorted voice : Who am I? 
 Harrison... You're one of them. 
 A meta-human. 
 Yes, I am. 
 And I protect my own.
