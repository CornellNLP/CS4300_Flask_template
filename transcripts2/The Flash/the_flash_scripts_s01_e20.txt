 Barry : My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 Barry : My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. And one day, I'll find who killed my mother... 
 Mom! 
 Barry : And get justice for my father. I am The Flash. 
 Previously on The Flash... 
 Cisco : The night we trapped the Reverse-Flash in the force field, there's no reason that the containment system should have failed. 
 I've been having these dreams. 
 What happens in the dream? 
 Cisco : Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash, and he kills me. 
 Caitlin : If this is Dr. Wells, then who have we been working for this whole time? 
 Barry : A completely different person. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What the frack? 
 "Flash missing. Vanishes in crisis." 
 "After an epic street battle with the Reverse-Flash, 
 "our city's very own Scarlet Speedster disappeared in an explosion of light." 
 Barry, look at the date. 
 April 25th, 2024. 
 Guys, when I fought The Reverse-Flash at Christmas, he said that we'd be fighting for centuries. 
 Wait, you can't really think that this is from... the future. 
 That would means Dr. Wells, or whoever he is, is also... 
 From the future. 
 I have to say, I'm really digging the brighter red suit. 
 And the white on the symbol? 
 Cisco : That's dope. 
 Wait a second. 
 Suppose we now change the color on your suit. 
 Will it be because we got the idea from this picture? 
 That would mean we're living in a causal nexus. 
 This... wow. 
 This is so trippy. 
 Like, Marty and the Polaroid trippy. 
 Not as trippy as the name on the byline. 
 Iris West-Allen? 
 Mazel tov? 
 Gideon : Hebrew. 
 [Caitlin gasps] 
 Gideon : Ancient language of the Jewish people. 
 Uh-uh. What the hell was that? 
 Is someone here? 
 Hello? 
 Good evening, Barry Allen. 
 Uh... 
 H-hi. [stammers] 
 You know who I am? 
 Of course. 
 Barry Allen, director of Central City Police, CSI Division. 
 Director? 
 I guess you get a promotion. 
 Gideon : Also known as The Flash. 
 Founding member of... 
 What are you? 
 I am Gideon, an interactive artificial consciousness. 
 [exhales sharply] AI. 
 Sick. 
 You know Dr. Wells? 
 Gideon : Yes. 
 Do you know who he really is? 
 I don't understand the question. 
 I... I mean, what is he doing here? 
 W-why did he come here? 
 To kill you.

 He's in the Cortex. 
 Ask questions fast. 
 Why did he kill Nora Allen? 
 Because he was angry. 
 About what? 
 Gideon : That you escaped. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 He's on B level. He's coming this way. 
 What does he want from me? 
 For you to be The Flash. 
 Maybe that's why Wells let the particle accelerator explode, so that you could become The Flash. 
 Why? I mean, for what reason? 
 Guys, we got to go. He's almost here. 
 Hurry. 
 All right. 
 Wait a second. Wait. 
 What if HAL over there tells Wells that we were in here? 
 That would be bad. 
 If I can get into its operating system, maybe I can disable its memory core. 
 Gideon, can you show us where your operating system is? 
 Gideon : Certainly. 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah. Nope. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 Guys, he's in the corridor. 
 Gideon, could you just, like, not tell him that we were here? 
 Gideon : Of course. 
 I will accept any command given to me by you.

 Eddie. 
 Thank you. 
 What's the emergency? 
 Oh, no emergency. 
 I just wanted to, you know, talk to you... 
 Thanks. 
 Without Iris around or Barry around or Cisco around or Caitlin around. 
 So, in other words, you want to talk to me alone. 
 [chuckles] 
 What is it? 
 Right. 
 Um, so listen. 
 With everything going on... 
 Investigating Wells and finding out about Barry... 
 Eddie, you cannot tell Iris about Barry. 
 This isn't about Barry. 
 I know the timing might seem off, you know, with everything that's going on, but I want to propose to Iris, and I'd like your blessing. 
 [inhales deeply] 
 No. 
 [chuckles] Come again? 
 No. 
 You do not have my blessing. 
 [cell phone vibrates] 
 That's Barry. We got to go. 
 Joe, I only asked as a courtesy, out of respect. 
 I don't need your permission. 
 West : Really? 
 For three very smart people, that was really stupid. 
 What if Wells had caught you in that... 
 Time vault. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, I know we've seen a lot this past year, but time travel? 
 I did it. 
 Or I will do it, I mean. 
 Excuse me? 
 One of the two speedsters in Barry's house the night his mother died was Barry. 
 I mean, The Flash. He was there. 
 Which means that one day in the future, Barry will travel back in time to that night. 
 Okay. 
 Actually, I wasn't talking about that. 
 I kind of already time traveled. 
 By accident. 
 What? 
 I was running to try and stop a tsunami from hitting the city... 
 When was that? 
 A few weeks ago. 
 Right before you started getting those dreams. 
 Oh, you mean the ones where Wells uses his super-speeding hand to shred apart my heart? 
 Those? 
 Yes, right. 
 So, what if they're not dreams? 
 What else could they be? 
 Memories. 
 I'm not following. 
 All right, what if, that day, Cisco found out that Wells is the Reverse-Flash, and then Wells killed him? 
 But when I ran back a day, I changed the timeline so that event never happened. 
 If it never happened, how can Cisco remember it? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 I think the important thing is, he does. 
 Guys, I think I've got a really bad idea.

 You're out of your mind. 
 I'm not gonna try and convince you with promises. 
 But, Detective, give me a chance. 
 I think we already know what you're capable of, Doctor. 
 You hurt a lot of people that night. 
 So those doctors in there, they're good enough? 
 The best in the city, best in the country. 
 Look at them. 
 They have no clue what's going on. 
 They're baffled, and the reason for that is what's happening inside Barry is a mystery, and they don't have the tools to solve it. 
 But you do? 
 That's right. 
 Millions of people used to look at my lab, and what did they see? 
 They saw the future.

 doctor : Charge. 200. Pads. 
 Barry : Joe? 
 Joe, are you listening? 
 Yeah. 
 We... we have to access Cisco's memories somehow. 
 Somewhere in his subconscious is the key. 
 The key to what now? 
 Getting my dad out of prison. 
 And how are we going to do that? 
 We're gonna get Wells to confess to killing my mom. 
 So, this will allow Cisco to see into his dream? 
 I got the idea from a journal article on lucid dream therapy. 
 They think it can be used to help people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 [scoffs] Traumatized, stressed? 
 Check and check. 
 The theory is that it will allow people to objectively enter their dreams and face their fears. 
 Still working on the talking part. 
 And you're sure this thing isn't gonna, you know, mess with my brain? 
 Oh, the amount of electricity required to trigger lucid dreaming is harmless. 
 Probably. 
 Who's going to be lucid dreaming? 
 Um... 
 With all of the meta-humans in Central City, people have been seeing some strange things... 
 Things that they don't understand. 
 And it's really just a matter of time before psychological issues develop. 
 And lucid dreaming will help the doctors better understand their fears. 
 Intriguing. 
 Of course, you still need to guide the patient from the outside, right? 
 Direct them to specific aspects of the dream. 
 We're still working on a communications interface. 
 When we dream, the middle brain lights up with electrical activity, whereas the higher brain remains dormant. 
 Once we find a way to make both parts of the brain active, then it's just a matter of finding the frequency that will stimulate the language center. 
 Then the dreamer could speak. 
 He could describe his dream. 
 Exactly. 
 Or her dream. 
 It could be used for anyone. 
 Wells : Right, it's not gender specific. 
 I would try a frequency of 45 hertz to start. 
 Thank you, Dr. Wells. 
 Well, you never cease to impress me, Caitlin.

 It was never my intention to kill Nora. 
 But from my perspective, she was already dead. 
 It just happened sooner than it was supposed to. 
 No. That's not an admission. 
 Oops. 
 [dramatic music] 
 You're not gonna get away with this. 
 I'm not gonna get away with it? 
 [cell phone beeps, force field buzzes] 
 [chuckling] 
 Oh, you're smart. 
 You're smart, Cisco. 
 But you're not that smart. 
 Cisco! 
 Barry : No! 
 He didn't confess. 
 Cisco, are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm never ever gonna sleep ever again, but, yeah, I'm okay. 
 [solemn music] 
 He's dead. 
 Barry : He didn't confess. 
 Joe, this was it. 
 My dad's gonna be in prison forever. 
 Barry, I'm sorry. 
 Cisco : Hey, uh... 
 Whoa. 
 What the hell? 
 Wells : I told you this before. 
 I am always one step ahead... Flash. 
 Allow me to reintroduce to you Mr. Hannibal Bates and his incredible ability to transform into any person he touches. 
 Wells : I knew that ability would come in handy. 
 I did not expect it to come in handy this soon. 
 You used him! 
 Like you used all of us! 
 Wells : Well, he served a purpose. 
 Didn't take much convincing. 
 Just the simple promise of his freedom. 
 You ruined my life! All our lives! 
 We stood by you after everything that happened. 
 I can see how this must be difficult for you to understand, but trust me, your lives now are so much better because of what I have done for you. 
 West : You don't have to hide anymore. 
 We know you're not Harrison Wells. 
 Just tell us who you are. 
 A confession will get you nowhere. 
 You've seen who I am. 
 You know what I can do. 
 You want to kill me, go ahead. 
 I'm not gonna fight you. 
 But just tell the police what you did. 
 Get my dad out of prison. 
 Wells : I don't want to kill you, Barry. 
 I need you. 
 And... [chuckles] I also did not anticipate, as difficult as the past 15 years have been for me, how much I would come to love working with you. 
 With all of you. 
 And yet, that does not change what needs to happen. 
 Then face me now! 
 Oh, we will face each other again. 
 I promise you. Soon. 
 Very, very soon. 
 [cell phone vibrates] 
 He's in the time vault! 
 Barry! 
 [tense music] 
 It was all a set-up. 
 We thought we set a trap for him, but he set a trap for us. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Iris. 
 We have to find Iris. 
 Why? 
 Wells. 
 He's been watching all of us. 
 He has surveillance footage set up everywhere. 
 Our homes, my lab at the police station, Central City Picture News. 
 Cisco, call me when you have a location. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Iris : I am very much enjoying this stroll. 
 We needed a good stroll. 
 Yeah. 
 [chuckles] 
 Actually, though, would you mind if we park here for a second? 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 Um... 
 Oh, it's my dad. 
 Could you call him back later? 
 Sure. 
 What's going on? 
 Iris, this week, when I was arrested and it looked bad, you never wavered. 
 You never lost faith in me. 
 Impossible. 
 And even though we've been through some rough times, I've never lost faith in us. 
 [gentle music] 
 Iris West. 
 Eddie? 
 [tense music] 
 Eddie! 
 Bad timing, Detective. 
 Stop! Leave him alone! 
 Iris, no! 
 I know who you are. 
 You killed Barry's mom. 
 But you don't have to hurt anyone else. 
 [gasps] 
 [yelps] 
 Hey, Iris. 
 It's okay. It's me. 
 He took him. 
 The Man in Yellow, he took Eddie. 
 I promise I will find him, okay? 
 What is happening? 
 This is *** and I'm alone*** 
 Don't say anything to anyone. 
 I swear to you, I will bring him back, all right? 
 Wait, stop. [electricity crackles] 
 [triumphant music] 
 Barry? 
 [groans] 
 You might as well take that mask off. 
 I know it's you, Wells. Or whoever you really are. 
 Well, allow to to introduce myself. 
 My name is Eobard. 
 Eobard Thawne. 
 I don't understand. 
 Why do you have my name? 
 Why? 
 Well, 'cause we're family, Eddie. 
 Funny, I haven't seen you at any reunions or weddings. 
 [chuckles] That is funny. 
 And the reason for that is because as far as those guest lists are concerned, I haven't been born yet. 
 So that's why you didn't kill me that night at S.T.A.R. Labs? 
 [dramatic music] 
 This whole thing... 
 It's been about me? 
 Not a chance. 
 You, my friend, are simply my insurance. 
 [machine beeping] 
 [chuckles] 
 You look so young. 
 [solemn music] 
 And I could kill you right now so easy. 
 What I wouldn't have given... 
 [sighs] 
 All those times before to have had you like this. 
 So... helpless. 
 But fate, it's tricky, isn't it? 
 I come here to destroy you... 
 And then to get home, I have to be the one who creates you. 
 [chuckles] 
 But I will say, it's been an education... 
 Watching you grow up all these years. 
 Science fairs and soccer games. 
 No hint, no sign, no trace of the man you will be one day for whom I have nothing but hate. 
 And to be clear, nothing is forgiven You will be eradicated. 
 I promise you, Barry Allan, that you will die.
