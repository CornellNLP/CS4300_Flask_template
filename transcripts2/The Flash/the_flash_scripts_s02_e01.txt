 Last season, on "The Flash"... 
 What's happening to me? 
 I wasn't the only one affected, was I? 
 We've been searching for other meta-humans, like yourself. 
 Don't be afraid, Cisco. You were affected, too. Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me. Yes, I did. What do you say we do that? Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash. [knife sinking in] You killed my mother! Why? We're enemies, rivals, opposites,  reverses of one another. Just tell the police what you did. Get my dad out of prison! You could go back and save your mother. A wormhole, opening the gateway  into time itself. I always win, Flash! Eddie! Eddie's his ancestor. If Eddie dies, he'll never be born. He's being erased from existence. The singularity won't stop, not even after the Earth is gone. We have to disrupt the motion. It cannot be stopped! I have to try. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] He's coming back around! Yeah, to die! [both grunting] I swear one of these days I will kill you! [grunts] [groans] I was late again, wasn't I? [laughs] Right on time. - [sirens wailing] Whoo! [laughs] Two down at the same time? Superhero double play, baby! Didn't do it alone. You're never alone, Barry. Neither are you, Mrs. Raymond. [groans] Thank you for not doing that when I was inside you. It happened one time. Let it go. Snart and Rory. You're gonna put a cop like me out of a job. Just trying to help. You do more than help, Barry. You give the people of this city hope. You're the hero, Barry. Congratulations, everyone. A spectacular victory. A milestone, if you will. Mr. Allen, I believe there's nothing left I can teach you. I believe... that you're ready to do all of this on your own. [quiet beeping] My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible, and I became the Flash. I used my powers to find the man responsible for my mother's death. I thought I would finally get justice for my family, but I failed. It's been six months since the Singularity. I'm on my own now. Decided it's better that way. Keeps the people I care about safe. There's only one thing I can do now. I run. How's it going? Hey. Uh, good. How you doing? Good. So, the victim. His name is Al Rothstein. He's a welder here at the nuclear plant. Co-worker found him this morning. So, what do you got? Petechiae on his face and the whites of his eyes, and this bruising around his neck... Oh, so he was strangled. Mm-hmm. By someone very strong and very large. Or something? This wasn't Grodd. Oh, thank God. - [sighs] Look, I'll let you know when I find more. So this Flash Day thing. I'm hoping you're planning on making an appearance. Ah... I haven't decided. Bar, I heard the Mayor's trying to give you the key to the city. Yeah, I don't need an award. You love getting awards. Like all those science trophies you got in high school? Those I deserved. I'll let you know what I find, all right? All right. [camera shutter clicks] Flash Day is almost here. A special downtown rally to honor the man who saved Central City. It's been six months since the Flash saved Central City from the freak black hole that erupted in the sky. Joe, where are we at with the murder at the nuclear plant? Barry's still analyzing the evidence, but there was definitely something weird. Yeah, which is why I let you have that Anti-Meta-Human Task Force. Speaking of which, where's your scientific advisor? Ho, ho, ho! Fear the beard! It's a very distinguished look... Sir. What is all this, Mr. Ramon? Oh, this right here? This is a little something I'm working on. I'm cooking it up for Joe and the task force to take down meta-humans. I'm think I'm going to call it The Boot. Oh, here are the receipts. [sighs] Oh, um, Captain, one more thing. You are not getting a badge, Mr. Ramon. [chuckles] He's really stingy with those badges, isn't he? Yeah, cops are funny that way. So you really think you can get this to work? Don't have me caught out on the streets with my pants down. Yes, once I finish the Boot, CCPD will totally have what it needs to take down a meta-human. Especially now that Barry has decided to go all Lone Wolf McQuade and fight crime by himself. I know, right? Have you spoken to him? Not really. Haven't even heard from Caitlin since she started work at Mercury Labs. Hey Cisco. Hi, Dad. Hey, baby. Hey, I was wondering if you'd talked to Barry about the rally. We was just saying. [both chuckle] I'm sorry, but, I can't believe they're gonna give the Flash the key to the city. Although technically, as members of Team Flash, we should all be getting keys. Well, you know Barry. The more we try to convince him to do something, the less he's gonna want to do it. Yeah, but he should go. Someone should try and get through to him. Maybe his best friend. Joe, believe me, I've tried. I meant her. Bye, baby. Yeah. Okay. - [whooshing] [fast hammering] [drill whirring] [whooshing] [whooshing] [drill whirring] [exhales] You know, if you ever decided that you didn't want to be the Flash, you have a good future being a contractor. [chuckles] Thanks. Yeah, I'm just trying to put it all back exactly how it was before the... You know. [clears throat] Seems like a lot of local businesses are being rebuilt at night. In secret. I was thinking about writing an article about it for the paper. Don't. Please. Look, people have heard the stories. They've read the articles. They've maybe even seen the red streak racing past them. but they've never seen the Flash, Barry. So that's why you're here? You came to talk me into going to the rally? 'Cause I'm... I'm not gonna go. People just want to thank the man who saved Central City. Well, they can't, 'cause that's not me. You should know that, better than anyone. [sighs] Central City believes in the Flash. So do I. [crowd panicking] [rumbling] [wind blowing] [thunder rumbling] [debris crashing] [crowd screaming] [woman screams] Brilliant! He's contained the Singularity by adding to its angular momentum! Barry, it's stabilizing. Keep doing what you're doing! I'm not sure how much longer I can. Cisco! Now what? We have to merge the inner and outer event horizons. How do we do that? By separating in the eye of it. The amount of energy from the fissure should do the trick. It's our only hope, Ronald. Ronnie, no! It's too dangerous. What if you can't escape the inrush? Cait, we have to try. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Ronnie... Professor... No! [panting] Ronald... Ronald... I'm so sorry. [emotional music] [marching band plays] [crowd cheers] Are we expecting trouble? Cops always expect trouble. In this city, I expect super evil flying monsters. That's a solid expectation. [chuckles] Well, I'll be. [crowd cheering] Good morning, Central City! A year ago, our world changed. Our city became ground zero for... some pretty weird stuff. We got a new breed of criminal: Men and women who defied not only our laws, but physics and reason. But we got something else, too. We got the Flash! [crowd cheers] Our wounds run deep,  and I know many of you are afraid  of what threats tomorrow may bring. But the Flash doesn't just protect us, he restores hope where it was lost. That's why I'm honored to present the key to the man who saved Central City: The Flash! [crowd cheers] [whooshing noise] [crowd cheers] [crowd chants "Flash!"] Flash. Flash. [crown continues to chant "Flash!"] - [emotional music] [crowd continues chanting] The doors to Central City will forever be open for you, Flash. [people scream] Look out! [crowd screams] You all right? I got this, all right? The man who saved Central City, hate to rain on your parade. Oof! [tires screech] Cisco! Cisco! The Boot! Right! [gun shots] Locked and loaded. Go! Booted! [buzzing noise] [grunts] [roars] Cisco, you said this thing would take him down. He's not going down. He went up. Run! Run! What are you doing? I'm throwing, you're shooting. [grunts] [roars] That's Al Rothstein. The body we found at the nuclear plant, he's alive! According to the coronerâs office, Al Rothstein's body was in the morgue all night, so we can scratch off "zombie attack." Rothstein have a twin brother? Nope. Only child. And get this, the night the accelerator exploded, Rothstein was on his honeymoon, in Hawaii. Huh. So we're looking for a guy who's really strong, can grow twice his size, and just happens to look exactly like the guy he murdered? I would think this meta was really cool if everything about him didn't just terrify me to my core. Is that what happened to you? You looked really spooked there for a minute. Uh... I actually see the guy that I can ask about it right now. Call you back, okay? Hey. So, the hospital next to the Flash Day rally, The x-ray and CT machines all failed at once. Was that because of you? I did not do anything that would cause that. I'm 92% sure. I'm going to go make that 100. Excuse me. You okay? We need to talk. Okay. Barry can't do this alone anymore. [sighs] That's his plan and I don't know how to talk him out of it. At this point, I'm just trying not to push him farther away. Well, maybe Barry has been so successful at pushing you, me and everyone else away because we keep letting him. Let's not let him. What do you suggest? Well, "if you keep getting 'no' for an answer, stop asking questions." I say that. You quoting me to me? What can I say? You are a very smart man. [chuckles] So this is what it looks like inside Mercury Labs. Security here is way better than it was at S.T.A.R. Labs, what with people walking in and out of the Cortex all the time. Hi Cisco. Sweet Sarek. Is that a 6K proton splicer? Yes, it is. Dr. McGee insists on having all the latest technology. Wow. You deserve it. [chuckles] I spotted you, at the rally today, and I'm guessing you saw what happened. Cisco, I can't come back. Okay, check this out: we found this on a victim at the nuclear power plant, but the badge shows absolutely nothing at all, which is so weird. What's also weird is that at the same time that meta-human grew, all the x-ray machines within a mile radius just went belly-up. Cisco. Just... if you could just... See if the badge was tampered with or something. I mean, if it's broken, or... Whatever. It'll really help. Mr. Allen. Barry Allen? Yeah. I'm Greg Turk. I'm an attorney at Weathersby and Stone. I don't usually make house calls, but I've been trying to get in touch with you for several months. Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I've just, um... I've been really busy with police work. We need to talk about S.T.A.R. Labs. As you know, Harrison Wells left the property to you as part of his living trust. Yeah, which I did not ask him to do, but I've been keeping the place up. Well, It's going to take more than cleaning the floors to retain it, I'm afraid. The facility and the real estate are scheduled to go into receivership at the end of this week unless... you watch this. What is this? A video message drafted by Dr. Wells. What's on it? Have you seen it? No. He was very specific. It was only to be watched by you. The device will send me a notification after you've viewed it. And at that point, I'll have everything ready to execute. I'm not going to watch that. Well, that's up to you, Mr. Allen. I'm only here to represent Harrison Wells' final request. Good day. [quiet music] [beeping] What are you guys doing here? Working. So, Caitlin was right. Yes, all humans contain small amounts of radiation due to contact with cell phones, microwaves, televisions, et cetera. Our bodies are natural conductors. I think our meta's been sucking up all the radiation around him and using it to power himself. Which is why the x-ray machines at the hospital failed the day of the rally. So if we want to find him, we gotta look for places without radiation. All right, guys, I don't want any of you here right now. Tough. You need your partners. You need your friends. Barry, everyone in this room cares about you, but we also care about this city. We all want to make a difference, and that means fighting meta-humans, and that means working with the Flash. You can't deny us that. Not anymore. Got him. There's a three block dead zone near a hazardous waste reclamation plant. It should be blooming with rads, and right now it's at zero. That's where you'll find your atom smasher. [chuckles] Because he absorbs atomic power, and he, well, smashes. Come here. [chuckles] That's a great name. Welcome to the team. Thank you. Great, guys, thank you. You can go now, all right? Barry, you need to let Cisco and Stein figure out a way to stop this guy. No, I don't. [all sigh] Barry left his comm system behind. We can't talk to him. He's on his own. [sighs] [inhaling] [exhaling] Well, this is a curve ball. I thought I was going to have to come looking for you. I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else. I'm only here to hurt you, buddy. Yeah? Then why'd you kill Albert Rothstein? And why do you look like him? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. [chuckles] Try me. I'm about to. Is there really no way of knowing what's going on in there? I'm looking for the security cameras. Booyah. 
 
 [heroic music] My turn. [choking] Dad. Maybe I can make it there. No, you won't, and what are you gonna do when you get there? The Boot didn't work on him. Alarm! Believe me, we're all alarmed. No, the alarm system. You've tapped into the surveillance cameras, correct? Correct! "Come on, feel the noize." [grunts] [grunting and choking] He said you were some kind of big hero, but you don't seem worthy of him, or this city. [alarm blares] [sighs] Professor Stein, you are a genius. I believe that's already been well established. [laughs] [gasping] No, thank you. Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite. I'm not hungry. It's been six months, Barry. You gotta eat, son. [sighs] It's a good move, being angry all the time. I get it. You miss your mom and dad, and you want to show them that you're strong. Being mad makes it easier. Tougher thing to do would be to let yourself feel. It's okay to be sad. You can be sad, Barry. Your parents will understand if you're not strong all the time. That is why I'm here. It's okay, son. I got you. [heart monitor beeping] You're good. I got you. Where is everyone? I figured you wouldn't want an audience when you came to. [scoffs] Yeah, thanks. Iris is right. You're not gonna do this anymore. For the last six months I've given you your space to work all this out, come back to us. But today proved that you'd rather just get yourself killed. [chuckles] It's better than getting my friends killed. You want me to tell you that it wasn't your fault? I can't. It was. Guess what? You weren't the only person making decisions that day. All of the rest of us were there too. Eddie and Ronnie, they chose to help you stop Wells, and stop that... Singularity. Singularity thing. It's on all of us, Barry. So stop with this hogging all the blame and regret. We gotta live with it. Move on. What do I do now? Well, I know that you've been rebuilding Central City at night. It's just bricks and paint. Maybe you should start trying to rebuild... things that really matter. What are you doing here? Sorry, I should've called or something. I just... I wanted to see you. It's been a while. Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you at the Flash Day celebration. I was surprised. You, better than anyone, know I wasn't the hero that day. Of course you were. No. [sighs] Cait, Ronnie died saving me. and I should've saved him, and I'm... I'm so sorry. Barry, I know that you did everything you could. It wasn't your fault. I don't blame you for Ronnie's death. I blame myself. Why? When Ronnie first became Firestorm, he asked me to leave Central City, and go somewhere that we could have a normal life. And I said no. I couldn't leave S.T.A.R. Labs, Dr. Wells... you. If I had gone with him, Ronnie would still be alive. Being at S.T.A.R. Labs just made me think of that  every single day. Here. Oh, you carry a handkerchief now? What are you, 80? [object clatters to floor] What's that? Ah, it's uh... Apparently, in case of his death, Wells had some kind of a living will. And you haven't watched it yet? No. No, I've... been too afraid. What if we watched it together? All right. [sighs] Hello, Barry. If you're watching this, that means something has gone horribly wrong. I'm dead and the last 15 years have been for nothing. Bummer. 15 years. You know, when I realize that in all those years helping raise you, we were never truly enemies, Barry. I'm not the thing you hate. And so, I want to give you the thing that you want most. It won't matter. You'll never be truly happy, Barry Allen, trust me. I know you. Now... [clears throat] Erase everything I said up to this point. Give the following message to the police. My name is Harrison Wells. Being of sound mind and body, I freely confess to the murder of Nora Allen. In her home, on the night of March 18th, in the year 2000. I attacked Nora Allen in her dining room. Oh, my God. I stabbed her in the chest with a large butcher knife... He confessed. From the drawer to the left of the sink in the kitchen. This is it. [laughs] This is what I need to free my dad. Hey, Joe. Yeah, hey. Can you have everybody meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs? Yeah. All right, thanks. Yeah. All right, bye. [exhales] I'll drive. Okay. You think the video's enough? Mm-hmm. Well, sure. What's she saying? Hold on. Wells gave all the right details. It's not a done deal yet, but the D.A. says it looks good. Yeah, I'm here. Is it good news? I think so. Henry's coming home? Oh! [laughs] Okay, well... that still leaves Atom Smasher to deal with. Last time you faced him, it did not go well. No, it did not. I clearly can't stop him by myself. So how are we gonna beat him? Well, ever since I was shown a drained radiation tag, which I haven't been able to stop thinking about. Thank you, Cisco. You're welcome, Caitlin. If this guy likes radiation so much, I say we give it to him. [sighs] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Showtime. What's up? I see you got my message. That light was perfect bait. What made you think of that? I don't know, I think I saw it in a comic book somewhere. You want me? You're gonna have to catch me. [growls] It's working, dude. Rothstein's following you. I must say, he's quite agile for a man his size. Run, Barry, run. Come on. [crashing noises] [dramatic music] Didn't think I could catch you, huh? No, I knew you could. Now, Cisco! [beeping] [alarm blares] The amount of radiation about to flood that room... Atom Smasher won't be able to absorb it all. - [alarm blares] [growling] [heroic music] [roaring] The radiation's been cleared. It's safe for you to go in. I'm sorry. I couldn't let you hurt anyone else. Why? Why did you want to kill me? [gasping] He promised he'd take me home... if I killed you. Who? Who promised you that? [gasping] Zoom. [panting] Let's get out of here. I'll race you. [laughs] You will lose. [X Ambassadors' "Renegades" plays] All : Welcome home! [cheers and applause] ♪ Run away-ay with me ♪

Looking at all of you, thinking how far we've all come,  and remembering those who are no longer with us, I'm reminded of a Hebrew word used during times of graduation. Kadima. It means, "Forward." Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Well said. Thank you. [clears throat] You good? Ah, yeah. [laughs] Stuff goes to your head after being away from it for 14 years. I bet. All right, well, look. I was thinking, what if, in the morning, the two of us started looking for an apartment for both of us, and Iris has actually been doing some research on how to get your medical license back so you could start your practice up again, or, if you wanted, come work with us at S.T.A.R. Labs. I don't know. I mean... What's wrong? You okay? Yeah, it's a party. Come on, we can talk about all this tomorrow. Talk about what? Barry... Are you not planning on sticking around? Okay. Okay, do you think... Can you be all that you are becoming... With me here? [chuckles] You're the only family that I have left. Well, that's not really true, is it? Don't you have another family in this room? They need your help too, Barry. When you need me, I will be here, but right now, Central City doesn't need you to be Henry Allen's son. It needs you to be the Flash. My kid. The superhero. [sighs] I have to go. I need you to tell me that it's okay. Yeah. [melancholy music] [elevator dings] Hey. Hey. Your dad get off okay? Yeah, I just dropped him at the station. You good? I don't know, I... Just feels like every time I win, I still lose. Well... It's not bad. No, it's not bad. It's pretty cool. It's real cool, come on! Hey! Hey. Ho ho! Hey, guess what? I added a little upgrade to your suit. [chuckles] It's just like the one from the future newspaper Gideon showed us. I was thinking, you know, you shouldn't fear the future anymore, right? No, and it'll be here faster than we think. Well, see, I like it. The lightning definitely pops more against the white. And S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever. Increased security and surveillance. Re-coded, double firewalled, electronic lock sets. Nothing is getting through here without us knowing. So people can't just waltz in and out of here. Exactly. [gasps] For real? Stay where you are. Who are you? You don't know me, but I know you... Barry Allen. Take one more step, it'll be the last step you take. The man asked you a question. Who the hell are you? My name is Jay Garrick, and your world is in danger.
