 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. 
 When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 My father went to prison for her murder. 
 Then an accident made me the impossible. 
 To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. 
 And one day, I'll find who killed my mother... 
 Mom! 
 And get justice for my father. 
 I am The Flash. 
 Previously on  The Flash... 
 You killed my mother. Why? 
 If you want to know that, you're gonna have to catch me. 
 Not fast enough, Flash. 
 I love you, Iris. 
 I couldn't lie to you anymore. 
 I'm sorry. 
 My name is Barry Allen. 
 I am not the fastest man alive. 
 That title belongs to the man who killed my mother. 
 But not for long. 
 That was too close. 
 He told me to make it hard. 
 Pretty sure he didn't tell you to make him dead. 
 Remember, this is just supposed to be a training exercise to improve Barry's speed. 
 Cisco, you gonna bring it or what? 
 Bring it. 
 [Missile whistling] 
 [Grunting] 
 Why isn't he running away? 
 Barry, run away.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Very impressive, Mr. Allen. 
 Your reaction to stimuli at super-speed continues to improve. 
 It's still not enough. 
 It will be. 
 You keep working like you are, you stay focused like you are, and you will be ready the next time your man in the yellow suit comes around. 
 I think you mean the reverse-Flash. 
 What? He said it, not me. 
 And he's right. 
 Yellow suit, red lightning, and evil... the reverse of Barry. 
 Meh. 
 Actually, I kind of like it. 
 All right, I'm still ready for another round. 
 How many more drones do you have left? 
 Two. 
 And they've got lasers. 
 Both : No. 
 [Crunching, cracking] 
 [Engine revving] 
 [Tires screeching] 
 Told you it would break. 
 And the shrink says I'm crazy. 
 What is this place? 
 Customs warehouse. 
 Imported cars from Europe, all worth a fortune. 
 Question. 
 How do you suggest you and I drive all these cars out of here? 
 We're not. 
 We're not stealing anything. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Our entrance set off the silent alarms. 
 The cops will be arriving in 2 minutes and 14 seconds. 
 Bring them. 
 [Grunts] 
 That's not for the cops, as we discussed. 
 He'll be here. 
 [Police sirens blaring] 
 You do hear that, right? 
 He's not coming. 
 We're leaving. 
 This better make sense real fast, buddy. 
 It will. Let's go. 
 You promised me I'd get to do my thing. 
 I always keep my promises. 
 Seat belt. 
 [Grunts] 
 Are you sure nothing's missing? 
 That's what the supervisor said. 
 I can check again. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Bar. 
 Hey. 
 Well, the breakage indicates that the door somehow had zero viscoelasticity when it hit the ground. 
 What does that mean to normal people? 
 Sorry. Uh... 
 The steel shattered like glass. 
 It was frozen, Joe. 
 Snart. 
 He's back. 
 I thought Snart was some world-class thief. 
 All these expensive cars... He didn't take any of them? 
 It doesn't make sense. 
 Eddie, put out an APB on Snart. 
 Got it. 
 [Metal clatters on floor] 
 Snart wasn't here to steal anything. 
 He was setting a trap. 
 For me. 
 And by me, I mean... yeah, I know who you meant. 
 God, you're beautiful. 
 Mick. 
 This is a joke. 
 How do you know this Flash didn't skip town, hmm? 
 Maybe that's why he didn't show up. 
 Or maybe he's dead. 
 Or maybe someone smarter than you iced him. 
 He's not dead, and he didn't leave town. 
 You will tell me what we're stealing this time. 
 We are partners, after all. 
 This is what we came for. 
 That's worth money? 
 It's called fire & ice, an abstract modern-day masterpiece said to represent the dichotomy of being. 
 It represents to me that people with lots of money buy dumb stuff. 
 Osgood and Rachel Rathaway, one of the richest couples in central city, paid 25 million for it in Paris. 
 They're flying home with it today. 
 Mm. 
 Captain cold is back? 
 For a non-metahuman, Leonard Snart is proving to be quite the Nemesis. 
 He still has the cold gun, the one he stole from us, the one I built. 
 Well, what does he want this time? 
 The Flash. 
 If Snart wants a fight with the Flash, then I'll give him one. 
 Well... 
 You don't think I should? 
 I didn't say that. But, Barry, as fast as you are, you cannot be everywhere at once. 
 And it becomes then a question of priorities. 
 Now, in the last month, you have made a commitment to increasing your speed, enhancing your reflexes, and it's working. 
 You're finally getting faster. 
 Okay, but what am I supposed to do, just ignore Snart? 
 The last time you had a fight with Snart, a train derailed. 
 You were lucky to get all those people to safety. 
 And if you don't give him that fight... 
 He may just back off, and there'll be no casualties. 
 Look, Barry, Cisco and I will work with Joe and the police and devise a way to catch cold. 
 Yes, I said it, Cisco. 
 As soon as it came out of my mouth, I heard it. 
 Yeah, we can definitely come up with ways to neutralize Snart. 
 Listen, Barry. 
 Whether or not you go after Snart, that's your choice. 
 We here, we will do whatever we can to support you. 
 But after this past Christmas, after the events with the reverse-Flash... 
 I just think he poses a greater threat to all of us. 
 Okay. 
 T-minus three days and counting... 
 Till the big move in. 
 You know, I've never had a roommate. 
 But it did occur to me that if we ever get in a fight, I can't just storm away and go home, because home will be with you. 
 Are you predicting many arguments? 
 Have you met me? 
 I remember the night we met. 
 I stopped a mugger who stole your bag. 
 My hero. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Eddie, you know where Joe is? 
 Uh...I think he's upstairs in your lab. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 No second thoughts about moving in together? 
 None. 
 Joe, hey. 
 Hey. I'm glad you're back. 
 I've been going over Snart's file. 
 Thanks. Yeah, I need to talk to you. 
 As CSI, my work on this case is done. 
 And as the Flash, I don't think I can focus on Snart right now. 
 You mind telling me what brought about this change of heart? 
 This man in yellow, the man that killed my mom, is still out there. 
 I have to be ready to face him, which means amping up my speed. 
 It's a question of priorities. Your mom's killer isn't the only reason you've been doing this. 
 You told me that if you could use your powers to save someone from a burning building, you would. 
 Look, Dr. Wells and S.T.A.R. Labs are gonna work with you. 
 Cisco thinks he has a way to protect the police against Snart's cold gun. 
 Barry, I can understand if you're scared. 
 We talked about this. Of course I'm scared, Joe. 
 This guy could run into the precinct and kill everyone in here in seconds. 
 He threatened Iris. 
 I won't let him hurt the most important people in my life again. 
 If that means devoting every second I have outside this place to getting faster and to stopping him, then that's what I'm gonna do. 
 I'm sorry. I've made up my mind. 
 Aw. Mcsnurtle the turtle. 
 How you been? 
 When did you stop sleeping with this? 
 It was your favorite. 
 He was. 
 But if I remember correctly, you took him away from me after I broke your  Duke Ellington: Live at the Blue Note  vinyl. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Mm. 
 You can have him back now. 
 Oh, gee, thanks. 
 Oh, dad. 
 I'm going to miss you, baby. 
 Dad, I'm only ten minutes away. 
 I know. Don't you worry about me. 
 I'll be fine, just like always. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You came to help her pack? 
 Oh, no. No, no, no. 
 Iris said that she had something for me. 
 Oh, um... 
 I found this in my closet. 
 [İris and father laughing] 
 I haven't seen this in years. 
 Well, the nerd survival kit is still intact. 
 Wow. 
 I thought those might be worth something. 
 I am so late for work. 
 I promise I will clean this up when I get back, okay? 
 Bye. 
 Bye, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 You mind telling me what's going on with you and Iris? 
 Nothing. 
 Hmm. 
 That's funny, because I have these two things called eyes, and it doesn't look like you two are fine. 
 I told Iris. 
 You told Iris you're the Flash? 
 No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. 
 No. [Laughs] 
 I told her how I felt about her. 
 Oh, God. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What did she say? 
 Well, I mean, she's still moving in with Eddie, isn't she? 
 I just want to pretend like it never even happened. 
 I mean, that's what we're both doing, so... 
 Well, not saying how you feel is what got you in this mess in the first place. 
 Speaking of which, we both know she's not gonna clean this mess up anytime soon. 
 Nope. 
 Sure. 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 If I could have everybody's attention, please. 
 You have our attention, Mr. Ramon. 
 Okay, check it. 
 So Dr. Wells and I, we took your ballistic shields and... and we lined them with a pretty sweet compacted heating ribbon designed to repel temperature at especially those reaching absolute zero, like captain cold's gun. 
 And that's supposed to keep us from getting turned into popsicles? 
 Um, yeah. 
 Yeah, they will. 
 How are we supposed to trust anything from S.T.A.R. Labs after you nuked the city? 
 You're right. 
 You're right, you shouldn't trust us. 
 What happened a year ago... that was our fault. 
 And we can't change the past, as much as we wish we could. 
 But tomorrow is a different story. 
 Tomorrow's a different thing. 
 We just want the chance to make things better. 
 Observe. 
 [Chatter] 
 Dummies are one thing. 
 My officers are another. 
 You seem pleased with yourself, doctor. 
 Well, I'm just happy to help the police catch Snart, Joe. 
 Barry might be able to help too. 
 I think Cisco's heat shields are more than up to the task. 
 And, Joe, if Barry feels he's gonna endanger lives by taking on Snart and, conversely, feels he's gonna save lives by training to take on the man in yellow... 
 That's ultimately his call. 
 You know what makes Barry so special? 
 He wants to help everyone he can, however he can. 
 Always has. 
 Until now. 
 I guess it's just a question of priorities then. 
 You know, Barry said the exact same thing to me. 
 And I thought, “doesn't sound like him.” 
 I guess because it sounds like you. 
 Hey. 
 [Gasps] 
 Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. 
 No, it's okay. I was just kind of focused. 
 Gotcha. 
 What's firestorm? It's one of the last things Ronnie said to me before he... Flew away. 
 My dead fiance can fly. 
 I haven't broke that to my parents yet. 
 You doing okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 No, I just... 
 I told Iris how I felt about her. 
 Bold choice. 
 I knew where we stood before. We were best friends. 
 And...I don't know. Now I just don't know what's normal for us anymore. 
 Before I met Ronnie, I knew exactly what was going to happen every day of my life. 
 It was predictable. I like predictable. 
 But when Ronnie and I started dating, everything started to change. 
 He made me try Indian food and scuba diving. 
 At first it was scary. 
 But then it was better. 
 Things weren't really normal with you pining after Iris and her being totally unaware. 
 Whatever happens next, it will be better. 
 Wait, Caitlin. 
 Scuba. 
 What about it? 
 Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, it's an acronym. 
 What if firestorm isn't a word? 
 [Keys clicking] 
 Fusion ignition research experiment and science of transmutation originating rna and molecular structures. 
 It's 800 pages. 
 [Clears throat] 
 There's a lot of stuff in there, but it mostly focuses on transmutation, which is the process of altering the structure of an element by unzipping the atoms... and rebuilding it to create an entirely new element. 
 Well, the article was co-written by Jason rush, who's a grad student here at Hudson university. 
 So if anybody knows what happened to Ronnie... 
 Maybe he does. 
 [Softly] Maybe. 
 Thanks. 
 Pleasant flight, Mrs. Rathaway? 
 Yes, quite. Thank you. 
 Careful, please. It's worth a fortune. 
 Welcome home, Mr. Rathaway. 
 Thank you, Ethan. 
 Sir, your son Hartley... he called again. 
 We don't have a son anymore. 
 [Power-up whine] 
 [Women screaming] 
 Someone better call 911. 
 [Police sirens blaring] 
 Move. Move! 
 Snart, freeze. 
 Mick! 
 Gaaaah! 
 What the hell? 
 Why do they call you people the heat? 
 I'm the heat! 
 Forget them, Mick. Get ready for him. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Mick. 
 Mick. 
 Mick! 
 We go, now!

 [Police shouting in background] 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Is he all right? 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Okay. 
 Hey. Hey, are you okay? 
 I'll call you back. 
 I'm fine. 
 Snart's new partner, he's got this handheld flamethrower. 
 Almost everyone was treated on the scene, but... 
 We got two in the burn unit, though. 
 I'm sorry. I should've listened to you. 
 It's all good. But... 
 The next time Snart and his pyro pal show up, you make them sorry they ever messed with you. 
 I got to call the hospital. 
 The cop's bullet ruptured the secondary internal fuel chamber. 
 It could've been worse. 
 You were right to get me to learn every part and circuit of this thing. Repairing it was... 
 A snap. 
 Give me one reason I don't kill you right now. 
 It's gonna be hard to find someone else to listen to your winning speeches. 
 You lost it out there, just like the last job. 
 You lost focus, became obsessed. 
 I'm obsessed? What about you? 
 You're usually counting the seconds, got the whole thing planned out, dotting “t”s, crossing “I”s. 
 But all you care about now is the Flash. 
 We have to put him down. 
 Why? 
 We got the finger painting. 
 It's worth millions. It's ours. 
 We're rich. Job done. 
 And what about the next job, Mick? 
 And the job after that? 
 With weapons like these, no one can stand against us, no one except the Flash. 
 If you want out, take the painting and go. 
 But if you want central city to be our home where we can do and take whatever we want... 
 This is our chance... 
 Your chance. 
 Mm. 
 Very motivational. 
 How do we get him? 
 The Flash isn't so different from us. 
 He's got partners too. 
 
 
 
 Jason Rush? 
 Yes. Dr. Snow? 
 Please, call me Caitlin. Thank you for meeting me. 
 Oh, happy to. 
 Although, to be totally up front, if this is about the resume I mailed in to S.T.A.R. Labs, I've already accepted a position at Mercury labs. 
 No, actually, I wanted to talk to you about Firestorm. 
 I'm sorry. This was a mistake. I have to go. 
 No, look, someone I care about is in trouble, and you're the only clue I have to help him. 
 Please. 
 What's the line? 
 I never got paranoid till they started plotting against me? 
 Why would they be plotting against you? 
 Because of our work, because of f.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. 
 Transmutation, the ability to alter matter on a molecular level. 
 We had some rudimentary success with our stage one testing, working with sand grains. 
 But Professor Stein said that we should... sorry, Professor Martin Stein? 
 He was the co-author of the paper? 
 Yeah, he was our team leader. 
 He didn't believe in baby steps, so we skipped to stage three. 
 Which was? 
 We melted a concrete wall. 
 But the university threatened to shut us down. 
 So Professor Stein published his paper without them giving permission, and they went nuts. 
 So he went to talk to a friend of his to secure private backing. And who was that? 
 He didn't say. He just said he'd call me later. 
 And no one has seen or heard from Professor Stein since. 
 What do you think happened to him? 
 All I know is that the army showed up the next day and confiscated all of our research. 
 So tell me, Dr. Snow, do you think I'm being too paranoid, or not paranoid enough? 
 Car trouble? 
 [Screaming] 
 Aah! Aah! 
 I hope we're not enemies. 
 What? No, of course not. 
 I thought you might blame me for pushing you to pursue your training rather than help the police. 
 Look, I'm an adult. 
 I make my own choices, my own mistakes. 
 And I'm glad you push me to be better. 
 It's so weird. 
 There was a time in my life that I would've paid money for your autograph. 
 And now we're... 
 Partners. 
 I was gonna say friends. 
 In case you doubt it, you push me to be better too. 
 Guys, you have to come look at this. 
 When the heat gun was fired, it increased the surrounding temperature of the air dramatically, sort of like an extreme heat wave. 
 Heat wave. 
 Stop doing that. 
 Okay. I measured the temperature output of both the cold and heat guns, right? 
 And while the cold gun achieves absolute zero, the heat gun successfully reaches absolute hot, or the hottest temperature an object can reach. 
 Planck temperature. 
 So potentially, these two guns could cancel each other out. 
 Yeah, but to do that, you'd have to make them cross streams. 
 You mean like Ghostbusters? 
 That film is surprisingly scientifically accurate. 
 And really quite funny. [Phone vibrating] 
 Hey, Joe. What's up? 
 [Background chatter] 
 Joe, anything? 
 There's no sign of Caitlin. 
 [Whispers] Oh, my God. 
 We're getting her back. We have to find Snart. 
 Damn right we do. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Joe, Joe. 
 We got a hit, a second pair of prints. 
 They belong to a Mick Rory. 
 Who is he? 
 Big-time arsonist. 
 He and Snart worked a job last year that went bad. 
 Half of Rory's body was burned in a fire that got out of control. 
 He escaped from an ambulance on the way to the hospital, hasn't been seen since. 
 Why would they kidnap someone like Caitlin? 
 Joe, thawne, it's on every station. 
 [Caitlin whimpering] 
 Greetings, citizens of central city. 
 I am Leonard Snart. 
 But you can call me cold. 
 I'm gonna make this very simple for everyone. 
 That red streak you've been hearing whispers about, the one mysteriously saving people these past few months? 
 Well, surprise, he's real. 
 He calls himself the Flash. 
 Porter and main, tonight, sundown. 
 Come out, come out, wherever you are, Flash. 
 Show the whole world you're real. 
 [Caitlin breathing hard, grunting] 
 Or this woman dies. 
 No, don't come for me. Stay away! 
 You're a friend of his, huh? 
 He's fast... 
 Like fire. 
 Fire, it's undefinable. 
 Heat, light, energy. 
 It's an evolution when things burn. 
 You're sick. 
 Maybe you're the sick ones. You ever think about that? 
 Not really. 
 Mm. 
 You've got third-degree burns. 
 Why didn't you get skin grafts? 
 The fire revealed my true self, showed me who I really am. 
 I wonder what your Flash will reveal when I burn his suit and skin off. 
 Do whatever you want to me, but leave him alone. 
 Oh, okay. 
 You and this Flash must be really close if you're willing to die for him, hmm? 
 You want me to show you who you really are? 
 That'd be fun. 
 Show you who you... Really are. 
 Mick. 
 Time to go. 
 You better pray the next people that come through this door is us. 
 [Phone buzzing] 
 Hey. 
 Okay, you're on. 
 Good luck, son. 
 Thanks. 
 Barry, after tonight, everyone's gonna know that the Flash exists. 
 Are you ready for that? 
 [Exhales] 
 I'll see you soon.

 Did... did you see that? 
 That was him. That was the Flash.

 Yeah, not as easy as it sounds. 
 Eddie, Eddie! 
 Iris, what are you doing here? 
 They evacuated Jitters. 
 I saw your car. 
 No, you can't be here. 
 It's not safe. 
 Are you sure Caitlin's here, Cisco? 
 Starting from Caitlin's car, I pieced together surveillance footage that led us to his general area. 
 But there's over a dozen warehouses here. 
 Yeah, but only one of them has had the heat on the last three nights. 
 And I'm betting Mick Rory likes it hot. 
 Okay. 
 Stay behind me.

 We need to expand the perimeter. 
 We can't. We can't let this spread.

 Thawne!

 Not while I'm around. 
 Or him.

 Hold on!

 Look out, look out, look out! 
 I can't get them to cross streams. 
 Speed isn't getting it done.

 Nice work, Eddie. 
 It wasn't me. 
 It was the Flash. 
 We're not gonna be needing these for the trial. 
 You'll make sure... they'll never hurt anyone ever again. 
 Mr. Ramon. 
 Thank you. 
 He was like a lightning bolt, zipping through the streets. 
 Took them both out singlehandedly. 
 That's amazing. 
 I wonder who he is. 
 If you ask me, he's a hero. 
 Okay, all right. 
 I think that's it. 
 This better be it. 
 Well, like you said, you're ten minutes away, so if you forget something... 
 Okay. 
 Dad. [Laughs] 
 I can't say it enough. 
 I'll miss you. 
 You know you can come around anytime, Joe. 
 Just give us a heads-up. 
 Or not. 
 Come around whenever. 
 You want a key? [Chuckles] 
 I'm gonna go. 
 I'll wait... In the truck. 
 Why don't I give you two a minute? 
 Well... Look, I know things have been really weird between us recently. 
 Yeah, they have. 
 Well, did you know that I can see into the future? 
 Really? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Did I forget to tell you that? 
 You did not mention it, no. 
 Wow. 
 [Laughs] 
 So what do you see? 
 I see you and Eddie being really happy together. 
 And things aren't weird between us anymore. 
 It took a little time, but everything's back to normal, and we're still best friends. 
 The future doesn't sound so bad. 
 No. 
 And it'll be here faster than you think.

 Yeah. 
 My baby girl. 
 See you. 
 Pffft. Well... 
 You okay?

 How about you? 
 It was bound to happen sometime, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Want to order some pizza and watch the ball game? 
 Make it pizzas and you're on.

 You know, if you ever need somebody to come and eat your food, I'm there. 
 Besides, the laundry machines in my building have been broken for, like, a month, so... 
 I don't know why you moved into that deathtrap in the first place, since you still got a perfectly good room here. 
 You said you were turning it into a gym. 
 We both know I'm not turning it into a gym. 
 Yeah. 
 Besides, you got me running around enough as it is. 
 You know, it is getting hard to hide the blasting in and out of my apartment at all hours of the night from my neighbors. 
 I suppose it would make sense for me to move back in. 
 I mean, I am a millennial. That is what we do. 
 [Laughing] 
 Well, don't do it on my account. 
 I'll be fine on my own. 
 Oh, yeah, me too. 
 Sure. 
 All right, roomie. You order the pizzas. 
 I'll unpack. 
 No way. 
 I want to help you. 
 I want to enjoy this. 
 All right. 
 You know this does nothing to me. 
 Just drink it. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I should've burned the entire city block down. 
 But instead, I listened to you. 
 We had the painting. We had the guns. 
 We could've had everything.
