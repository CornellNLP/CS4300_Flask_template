 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 Barry : My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. And one day, I'll find who killed my mother... 
 Mom! 
 Barry : And get justice for my father. I am The Flash. 
 Previously on  The Flash... 
 Barry : Last night, on my way to the morgue, I saw something. 
 Taxi! Oh, come on! 
 I'm gonna be late! 
 Simon Stagg, remember him? 
 Hasn't been seen in, like, six months. 
 You're saying Wells knows where Stagg is. 
 Mason : No, I'm saying Wells killed him. 
 I have evidence in a secure digital file that will explain everything. 
 There is a tsunami heading for the city. 
 You need to get as far away from here as possible. 
 I have not been able to stop thinking about you. 
 Go! 
 Aah! 
 [gasping] 
 [dogs barking] 
 No, no... 
 Taxi! Taxi! 
 Oh, come on! I'm gonna be late! 
 Oh, boy. 
 Cisco : Hey, what's going on? 
 Dude? 
 Yeah, Cisco. 
 I'm...here... 
 What happened? Why'd you stop? 
 I just got a little disoriented. 
 Well, you need to make up some time, man. 
 You better hurry up. 
 Hurry? What are you... 
 Hurry, as in get to the morgue. 
 The morgue? I was there. 
 Yesterday. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Come on, you gotta go. 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 Hey, Barr. What's with all the water? 
 Did the sprinkler system go off or something? 
 What? No, I checked the sprinklers. 
 They're all intact. 
 But the water has ice in it. 
 And the bruises on the coroner aren't just on his face. 
 Check... look at his torso. 
 Whoa. 
 How the hell did you know that? 
 He was killed by hail. 
 We have to listen to the recording. 
 Recording? 
 Thawne : Joe, we got something. 
 The coroner's office just installed an automated dictation system. 
 Listen to this. 
 coroner : Please... no more... 
 Mardon : I'll stop when you tell me... 
 coroner : Just stop! 
 Mardon : Who killed him? 
 It's Mark Mardon. 
 He wants revenge. 
 [screams of pain on recording] 
 And I really don't wanna go. 
 He's your brother, Cisco. 
 Not by choice. 
 Okay, well, how bad can a birthday party be? 
 Um, my folks think Dante's stink don't stink. 
 Doesn't matter how much he screws up, or how many times he gets into trouble. 
 In their eyes, he can do no wrong. 
 And yet, they never fail to remind me that I can do no right. 
 What if I came with you? 
 What? Seriously? 
 Absolutely. You've done so much for me. 
 Let me be there for you for a change. 
 And I could look at old family photo albums and see what little Cisco looks like without long hair. 
 I'm rescinding your invite. 
 Clyde Mardon has a brother? 
 So, both Mardon brothers survived the plane crash and then the dark matter released by the Particle Accelerator explosion affects them both in... 
 Barry and Wells : Virtually the same way. 
 That's right. 
 Only Mark's not like Clyde at all. 
 He can do things that you couldn't even imagine. 
 You mean he's sort of like a... 
 Barry and Cisco : Weather wizard? 
 Weather wizard? 
 Yeah. 
 [slurps] Mm. 
 Barry and Caitlyn : Trigeminal headache? 
 Mr. Allen. 
 A word please. 
 Yeah. 
 Wells : You ruptured the time continuum, didn't you? 
 You're experiencing temporal reversion. 
 Yeah! 
 How long? 
 Uh, a day and some change. 
 It's like I'm living it all over again. 
 Yeah, well that's good. That means there's not too much you could've messed up yet. 
 How did this happen? 
 I... I don't know. I mean, I was running faster than I've ever ran, and the first time that I lived this day some really horrible things happened. 
 There was a tidal wave and... 
 No. Do not tell me. 
 I do not want to know anything about the future you experienced. Nothing! 
 Okay, but Dr. Wells, I... 
 Barry. 
 Time... is an extremely fragile construct. 
 Any deviation, no matter how small, could result in a cataclysm. 
 Now here's what you're going to do. 
 Everything you did before. 
 Every word you uttered, every step you took, you're going to do again. 
 And you're not going to tell anyone this happened. 
 [sighs] 
 Good day, Dr. Wells. 
 Time will tell, Gideon. 
 Show me the future. 
 Gideon : As you wish. 
 The future remains intact, Dr. Wells. 
 If anything changes, alert me immediately. 
 Gideon : Of course, Doctor. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What's going on with you? 
 How'd you figure all that stuff out at the morgue? 
 Lucky guesses, I guess. 
 Look, I'm telling you, I'm gonna get Mardon if it kills me. 
 Joe, um... 
 I gotta run an errand. 
 I'll see you later. All right? 
 I didn't know there was anyone else like me. 
 Mardon : I'm gonna break out of here! 
 I'm gonna create a tidal wave that destroys your entire city! 
 Cisco : So, I still don't understand. 
 How did you find him? 
 I just had a hunch. 
 That's gotta be some kind of record. 
 [laughs] Yeah. 
 Well, there goes my excuse for bailing on my brother's birthday. 
 Do you have any idea what you've just done? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I just saved a lot of lives. 
 I warned you not to mess with the timeline. 
 Dr. Wells, if you would just let me tell you what was gonna happen, you'd understand why I did this. 
 Whatever tragedy you think you've just averted, time will find a way to replace it and trust me, Barry, the next one could be much worse. 
 Don Santini, they're here. 
 man : Move it. 
 Oh, love the paneling. Mahogany? 
 So glad your house is made out of wood. 
 It's gonna be a pleasure watching it burn. 
 Aah! Refreshing! 
 What are you doing back in Central City, Snart? 
 This is my city. 
 Our city. 
 I told you if I ever saw you again I'd put the hurt on you. 
 You stir up trouble. Trouble is bad for business. 
 It's time for you and your family to pack up. 
 Leave town. Retire to warmer climates. 
 Finito. 
 And if we don't? 
 You will all freeze. 
 Or burn. 
 I heard about your guns. 
 I also heard that you lost them. 
 So, tell me, Snart. 
 What the hell are you and your pyro friend gonna do without your fancy weapons? 
 This. 
 [fighting efforts] 
 [grunts] 
 Now that was fun! 
 Fun. Fun. Fun. 
 Go. 
 Tell the rest of the Santini family there's a new Godfather. 
 And his name is Cold. 
 [Spanish party music playing] 
 -  Hola. - Coma esta. 
 Wow. 
 Your parents really went all out with the cake. 
 Oh, well... it is Dante's birthday. 
 The most important day of the year. 
 Mi hijo  was invited to play Carnegie Hall when he was just 13 years old. 
 They invited the entire band, Mama. 
 Mrs. Ramon : That doesn't make it any less worthwhile. 
 [chuckles] 
 Hey. What's up, man? 
 Hey. 
 Glad you could make it. 
 Of course. 
 Hi, I'm Dante. 
 This is my friend, Caitlyn. 
 Hi, Caitlyn. 
 Happy birthday, Dante. 
 Thank you. 
 Here, I... I got you this. 
 Oh... 
 I think you'll really like it. 
 It's... 
 Thanks, man. 
 Yeah. 
 Excuse me. 
 [panting] I don't get it. 
 I've been running just as fast as I was when it happened, and nothing. 
 I'm still here. 
 Any number of things could've triggered the wormhole that allows you to repeat your day. 
 Your emotions, your circumstances, your cortisol levels, all of the above. 
 Well, I mean, my adrenaline was super high since Iris and the entire city... 
 No, no, no. 
 No details. I told you. 
 All right, I'm sorry, but Mark Mardon's already locked in the pipeline and nothing bad has happened. 
 Yet. 
 [knocks] 
 Detective. 
 Hey. What are you doing here? 
 So when were you planning on telling me you took down Mardon? 
 I... I just haven't had a chance yet. 
 You got sidetracked, you mean? 
 No, Joe, you can't be mad. 
 I'm not mad. 
 But I am curious. I mean, you were acting so weird at the crime scene. 
 I always act weird. 
 Okay. Weirder. 
 Look, Joe, there are just some things that I can't tell you, and you're gonna have to trust me. 
 [phone vibrating] 
 Hey, Linda. Yeah, I know. 
 I'm so sorry. I... I lost track. 
 I'm gonna head that way now. 
 All right, bye. 
 I have a lunch date with Linda. 
 I gotta run. 
 And I don't suppose you're gonna fill me in either? 
 No. 
 Mm. 
 [upbeat piano music] 
 Que linda, Dante! 
 Well, here is one who was touched by God. 
 Ah, I was a little rusty. 
 I haven't played in a while. 
 Oh, well... 
 If that was what you sounded like rusty, I can't imagine what you sound like when you've practiced. 
 Oh, for you, I'd practice morning, noon, and night. 
 [laughs] That means you'd actually have to get up in the morning. 
 So, Mom tells me you're still working at S.T.A.R. Labs, huh? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 No reason, man. 
 Guess it was just hard to find another job, huh? 
 Oh, I wasn't looking. 
 I actually like working at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 And we couldn't do what we do without Cisco. 
 Oh, he's loyal. 
 Just like a dog. 
 Oh, come on. Why are you so serious,  mi hija? 
 Happy birthday. 
 Hey! I am here. So sorry, again. 
 [exhales] 
 Well, you get a pass considering you're never late. 
 Hey, um... 
 What's going on with you lately? 
 Nothing. 
 Come on. 
 Give me a little credit here. 
 [sighs] 
 I've just been dealing with a lot of things lately. 
 I like you, Linda. And we really get along. 
 Relationships should be more than just getting along. 
 Your heart should ache for me. 
 Does it? 
 You're not upset with me? 
 No one did anything wrong. 
 I really do feel a lot for you, Linda. 
 It's just... 
 Just not as much as you feel for someone else. 
 Go get her. 
 "The Flash, speeding his way into our lives." 
 It's a little bit on the nose, don't you think? 
 I have something to show you. 
 Simon Stagg, remember him? 
 Hasn't been heard from in nearly a year. 
 Hey, Iris. Mr. Bridge, hi. 
 Do I know you? 
 Oh, no, we haven't met yet... fully, you know, um... 
 Iris, can I talk to you for a second? 
 Uh, yeah, sure. 
 We'll catch up later. 
 Yeah. 
 Nice meeting you, strange young man. 
 Is everything okay with you and Linda? 
 Uh... No, that's done. 
 Oh, I... I am so sorry. 
 No, no, no, it's okay. We're gonna be friends. 
 Um, yeah, no, it's gonna be awesome. 
 Uh...anyway, are you... are you free tomorrow? 
 Do you want to get some coffee and we can just talk and just tell each other stuff... 
 I don't know, stuff we got rolling around in there, you know? 
 I don't know. 
 O-okay, yeah, sure. 
 It sounds great. 
 Okay, great. Great! 
 All right, I'll see you. 
 I know you think Harrison Wells had something to do with Simon Stagg's disappearance, but you're wrong.

 Hey. 
 Oh, hey, man. 
 Thanks for meeting me here. 
 Even though... you can't get drunk. 
 [laughs] 
 No worries. 
 So, how was your day? 
 Great. But... 
 Linda and I did break up. 
 That's the first time I ever heard anyone use the word "great" to describe a break-up. 
 I have a feeling that I'm about to move forward with someone really special. 
 Okay. Go ahead, Barry. 
 [laughter] 
 Hi. 
 I don't normally do this, but I was watching you, and... can I buy you a drink? 
 Uh...wow. 
 I mean, I'm really flattered, but I... 
 Actually, I was talking to him. 
 Um... I'm... I'm sorry, you said... you said you were talking to me? 
 Yeah, I just told my friends over there that I thought you were cute and they dared me to come over here and talk to you, so... please talk to me. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I suppose I can talk to you for a little bit. 
 [mutters suggestively] 
 Yeah, no, I was just leaving. 
 Make me proud. 
 [clears throat] 
 I'm Lisa, by the way. 
 Hi, Cisco. 
 I'm just in town for this symposium at Mercury Labs. 
 Really? You... what do you do? 
 Oh, I'm a structural engineer. 
 Why do you look so surprised? 
 Can't a girl be an engineer? 
 No, of course. That's... 
 You just don't look like an engineer. 
 I can't help how I look. 
 I... I mean, it's good. 
 It's a... it's a good look. 
 It's a great look. 
 Well, you don't look so bad yourself. 
 Am I being pranked right now? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What do you think? 
 Cisco : I can't believe this. The day started out pretty terrible, but now it's turning out pretty damn good. 
 I'll say. 
 Wow. 
 Look at this. 
 These are nice things. 
 Oh, we're just squatting. 
 We? 
 Yeah. 
 Me and my brother. 
 Hello, Cisco. 
 What exactly are your intentions with my sister? 
 Oh, come on. 
 I should've known better. 
 I am not that lucky. 
 Please don't kill me for kissing your sister. 
 You kissed him? 
 You're not dad, Lenny. 
 I know. Dad's in jail. 
 Sterling role model. 
 What do you want, Snart? 
 Guns. Heat and cold, to be precise. 
 There's no way I am making weapons for you. 
 Never again. 
 Mick. 
 [muffled moaning] 
 I know I would do everything in my power to protect my family. 
 The question is, will you? 
 Dante. 
 Dante, just keep cool, okay? 
 Let me do my thing. 
 Oh, really? 
 And what? You're gonna save us with your mechanical engineering skills? 
 Right now, my skills are the only things keeping us alive, so if I were you, I would shut up. 
 You shut up! 
 Ah! There she is. 
 I missed this baby. 
 Here it is. All finished. You gonna let us go now? 
 You know, I took the first gun you made me apart dozens of times. 
 Learned how it ticked. 
 What went where. 
 Thought you could tamper with the firing pin without me noticing. 
 Nice try, kid. 
 [weapon whirs] 
 Yes. 
 Lenny? 
 Where's my gun? 
 Girl's gotta defend herself. 
 Besides, why should you two have all the fun? 
 My sister needs a weapon. 
 Something that suits her personality. 
 Make me something pretty and toxic, like me. 
 How about something with gold? 
 Gold. 
 [short laugh] 
 
 
 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 One incredibly heavy cronut and one Americano with an extra shot. 
 Just the way you like it. 
 Just the way I like it. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I know you, Iris. 
 [clears throat] 
 So...what is going on with you? 
 You're acting like Christmas came early. 
 [laughs] Uh... 
 Yeah, no, I guess it did, kind of. 
 Look, Iris, um... 
 I still think about you all the time and I know you've been thinking about me too, so let's just stop thinking and start doing. 
 Barry... 
 I know. 
 I know that we both have awful timing, but we were meant to be... 
 Barry, what are you talking about? 
 You and me. 
 We like each other. 
 Barry, we've been over this. 
 Okay? Nothing has changed for me. 
 No, but it has. 
 How do you know that? 
 I just... 
 I just know some stuff somehow. 
 I don't know, maybe it's like ESP or something, but... 
 Barry. 
 I love Eddie, okay? 
 I'm sorry, but nothing has changed for me since Christmas. 
 And you can't keep springing this on me. 
 Okay? It's not fair that you keep making me the bad guy who keeps telling you no. 
 [sighs] 
 [knocks and sighs] 
 What? No whoosh-in? 
 I needed the walk. 
 What happened? 
 Nothing, uh... 
 Linda... Iris... 
 I don't want to talk about it, actually. 
 Okay. 
 [sighs] 
 Have you talked to Cisco? 
 I've been trying him on his cell, but he's not answering. 
 Kind of... worried about him. 
 He had a rough night. 
 Trust me, it got better. 
 [phone vibrating] 
 Hey, Joe. What's up? 
 Yeah, Snart's back. 
 Wait, Cold is back? 
 West : Yeah, he was spotted at the Santini crime family casino. 
 If he's hitting the Santinis, we could be looking at the beginning of a mob war.

 Well, this day just keeps getting better, doesn't it?

 You killed my brother. 
 You shouldn't have messed with my family.

 This is sick. 
 Well, you wanted us to spend more time together.

 How many times are we gonna go through this, Snart? 
 Until the best man wins! 
 Drop the gun! 
 We both know you're not going to do anything to her. 
 Oh, by the way, meet my baby sister. 
 Lisa, Flash. Flash, Lisa. 
 Snart : Cisco has been very, very busy. 
 Unless you want me to mail small, frozen pieces of him back to his family, I'd take your hands off her. 
 Let him go, Snart. 
 I'll think about it. 
 Barr. 
 Witnesses reported seeing The Flash. 
 They said you had Snart dead to rights but you let him go? 
 Why? 
 Cisco. 
 Snart and his sister have him. 
 Oh, man. 
 Okay. Get to S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 I'll get there when I can. 
 All right. 
 Allen. 
 Yeah, Eddie, I... 
 [grunts] 
 Whoa. 
 Stay away from Iris. 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 Hey, if you two have a beef, you take it outside. 
 You know what the worst part is, Barry? 
 I thought you and I were friends. 
 [exhales] 
 So there's Cisco getting into a car with Snart's sister. 
 And the license plate is iced over. 
 All right, Dr. Wells, you were right. 
 I... I... I screwed with time and now time is screwing with me. 
 Cold is back, he kidnapped Cisco, and Iris is... 
 Stop right there before you cause another disruption to the timeline. 
 Barry : Please, Dr. Wells. 
 Please, I have to talk to someone. 
 Go ahead. 
 In the previous version of today, Captain Singh is seriously injured, Joe is in danger, and Iris said she had feelings for me. 
 And now Cisco's life is on the line, and Iris has no idea she confessed those feelings. 
 But she still has them, right? 
 The unconscious mind, Barry, it... it's a powerful thing. 
 It sounds like it took this apparent disaster to jar those feelings loose and without a disaster, those feelings remain deeper down. 
 Unaccessed. 
 I don't understand. 
 I thought that I was helping people by stopping Mardon. 
 Yes, but this new ability of yours, Barry, is dangerous. 
 You only traveled back in time one day. 
 What if you traveled back decades? 
 Centuries? 
 Imagine the havoc you could wreak. 
 But I will have the opportunity to travel back in time in the near future and save my mom. 
 Or...you're saying I shouldn't? 
 I'm saying how many more people could die if your mother lives? 
 Did you guys find Cisco? 
 Most people think the hottest part of the flame is the white part. 
 They're wrong. 
 [blows air] 
 You gonna admire those or you gonna drink 'em? 
 Both. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 I told her you wanted to become a priest. 
 Broke her heart. 
 Why'd you do that? 
 Because I was jealous of you, man. 
 I mean, even then I... 
 I knew exactly where my life was headed. 
 Nowhere. 
 Dante. 
 That's not true. 
 I live at home. 
 And I work a crap job for no pay. 
 Yeah, but you still manage to be mom and dad's favorite. 
 [scoffs] I don't even know why. 
 It's because they... they still think of me as their son, the concert pianist. 
 But you, man, they never understood your talents. 
 Never understood that you pursued your passion no matter what. 
 And me, I was just too scared to even try. 
 [speaking Spanish] 
 Dant... Dante... 
 No! 
 Aah!

 Oh! 
 Mick! 
 Mick, calm down! 
 Mick! We need them! 
 Mick? Baby? 
 It sounds like you're hungry. 
 Lisa : How about you and I grab some dinner? 
 I like you, kid. 
 You're smart. 
 You pulled yourself up from humble beginnings. 
 You seem like a good brother. 
 You too. 
 Debatable. 
 You answer one question for me, I'll let you and your brother walk. 
 What's the question? 
 The Flash. Who is he? 
 I swear...he always wears a mask. 
 Aah! 
 No! 
 No! Stop! 
 [cries in pain] 
 This is first degree frost bite. 
 Your brother could recover with proper treatment. 
 If not, all his tendons, blood vessels, and nerves will freeze. 
 His fingers will need to be amputated. 
 No more concertos for the Ramon family holidays. 
 Now tell me, who is The Flash? 
 There's nothing the satellite thermography. 
 You were right. This is all my fault. 
 How is this your fault? 
 Brave heart, Barry. We'll get Cisco back. 
 Cisco : I'm back. 
 Caitlyn : Oh, my God. Are you okay? 
 We were so worried. 
 What happened? 
 How did you escape? 
 I didn't. 
 Snart just let you go? Why? 
 He, um... he tortured my brother. 
 And he said he was gonna kill him if I didn't... if I didn't tell him... 
 Tell him what? 
 Who The Flash really is. 
 Cisco : I, honestly, man, they... they could've killed me. 
 But they were gonna kill my brother. 
 I couldn't let him do that. 
 [cries] 
 Hey. 
 I'm sorry, Barry. 
 No. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I put you in that position. 
 I'm the one who's sorry. 
 Where are you going? 
 I don't deserve to be here. 
 I won't be the one to put you in jeopardy. 
 Not again. 
 Never again. 
 Hey. 
 What? 
 What a surprise. 
 Oh. 
 [chuckles] 
 As big a surprise as Eddie punching Barry at a crime scene this evening. 
 Oh, my God. Is Barry okay? 
 Yeah. He...heals fast. 
 Look, Iris. This got complicated. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 Barry was too late. I'm with Eddie. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 Who do you love? 
 I mean, I love Eddie. 
 Okay. You need to make them believe that, because right now, I'm not sure either one of them does. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Did I ever tell you how wise and amazing you are? 
 Not enough. 
 See you later. 
 Bad time? 
 Yes, actually. 
 [sighs] 
 Don't worry, I'll be out of here soon. 
 Well, before you shuffle off forever, may I show you something? 
 I get it. I failed. 
 Wells : No, no, no. Now, you're an incredibly clever guy, Cisco. 
 So why don't you tell me why would I bring you down here? 
 Because we all failed that night. 
 But we kept going. 
 We kept trying to protect each other, and Barry, in spite of the setbacks. 
 Making a choice between two people you love, that is the hardest dilemma you will ever face. 
 Well, you won't have to worry about me making the wrong decision again. 
 All you proved today, Mr. Ramon, is that you're human. 
 All you proved today is that you love your brother. 
 And the reason that we all want you to stay is that we love you too. 
 Now, I am not a parent, but, in many ways, you have shown me what it's like to have a son. 
 Caitlyn over intercom : Guys, you should get up here. 
 Shall we? 
 The casino wasn't the target. 
 Then why did he do it? 
 Casinos keep tons of cash on hand to cover their markers, not to mention the money that they make. 
 But if they're under attack, the protocol is to relocate the money outside the casino. 
 So, that was Snart's plan all along. 
 To trigger the move. 
 Okay, where is it now? 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Get ready, we got company. 
 Aah! 
 [gunfire] 
 [tires squealing] 
 [weapon whirring] 
 [tires squealing] 
 Oh! 
 [crashes] 
 Good to see you... 
 Barry. 
 We have to talk. 
 Barry : I know Cisco told you who I am. 
 Can't really blame the kid for giving you up. 
 You or his brother? Come on! 
 I put him in a tight spot. 
 Same kind I got you in right now. 
 Can't really stop me now that I know who you are. 
 I could speed you to my own private prison where you'll never see the light of day. 
 You could, but then I won't be around to stop my own private uplink that'll broadcast your identity to the world. 
 So, the million dollar question. 
 What to do with me now, Barry Allen? 
 I won't let you keep stealing whatever you want, whenever you feel like it. 
 It needs to end. 
 Can't do that. 
 It's what I do. 
 Then find a new line of work. 
 Don't want to. 
 Why is that? 
 The same reason you keep running after guys like me. 
 The adrenaline. The thrill of the chase. 
 I love this game. 
 And I'm very good at it. 
 Then go play it somewhere else. 
 Leave Central City. 
 Can't do that either. 
 I love it here. [inhales] 
 This city is my home.

 You've seen what I can do. 
 You know that I can stop you. 
 You want to keep pushing your luck, go for it. 
 But from here on out, no one else dies. 
 If you're as good as you say you are, you don't have to kill anyone to get what you want. 
 That's true. 
 And if you, or anyone in your Rogues' gallery goes near any of my friends or family again, I don't care who you tell my identity to. 
 I'm putting you away. 
 I guess your secret's safe... 
 Flash. 
 For now. 
 Oh, I don't suppose you'd give me a ride back to town, would you? 
 The Rogues. 
 Cute.

 I... 
 I am so sorry, pal. 
 It's not like me to hit anyone. 
 I don't know what came over me. 
 Uh... thanks, Eddie. It's... it's okay. 
 You poor thing. I had no idea. 
 Is that right? Um... what exactly did you have no idea about? 
 I was just explaining to Iris and Eddie about your Lightning Psychosis. 
 My what now? 
 Your Lightning Psychosis. 
 How your recent odd behavior is a side effect of being struck by lightning. 
 Mood swings, sudden outbursts of affection, and other lapses in judgment. 
 He has had all of those things. 
 He told me that he had ESP. 
 Yeah, it's a very uncommon neurological phenomenon. 
 We're really only just now starting to research in kerauno-medicine. 
 That's why Barry's been spending so much time at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 I just... I wish you would've told me. 
 I didn't... it hardly feels real sometimes. 
 We're just glad you're getting help. 
 Yeah. 
 So, we're good? 
 Yeah, we're good. 
 Coffee? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 You are welcome.

 Come on. Hey. 
 Reverse Flash : Harrison Wells. 
 What do you know about him? 
 Ooh! 
 [whimpering] 
 Reverse Flash : What do you know? 
 Everything I know is in that drive. 
 I swear. 
 Oh! 
 Ugh! 
 Reverse Flash : Everything? 
 Everything! Just take it! 
 [panting] 
 You really were on to the story of the century. 
 Well... this century, anyway. 
 Do you think I made a mistake letting Snart go? 
 I think you did what you felt was right in the moment. 
 And really, Barry, that's the best any of us can hope for. 
 Now, let's be thankful the timeline remains intact. 
 Oh! I keep forgetting. 
 I've been meaning to ask you. 
 It's about Simon... 
 You were saying, Mr. Allen? 
 Uh... 
 Nothing. Sorry. 
 Goodnight Dr. Wells. 
 Goodnight Barry. 
 Barr, what's up? 
 Why did you want to meet up here so late? 
 I think that maybe you were right, about Dr. Wells. 
 Which part? 
 All of it.
