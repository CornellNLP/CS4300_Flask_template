 My name is Barry Allen, and I'm the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me, and one day I'll find who killed my mother... 
 Mom. 
 And get justice for my father. I am The Flash. 
 Previously on  The Flash... 
 Ronnie! 
 17 people died that night; Many more were injured. 
 I'm not the most popular person in town these days. 
 We're just supposed to get used to working above a makeshift prison housing evil people with superpowers. 
 What is this? 
 Somewhere you'll never hurt anyone ever again. 
 [Upbeat music] 
 [Laughter] 
 Farooq! 
 It's not safe. 
 Come down. 
 Farooq, I'm serious. 
 It's gonna rain. 
 Y'all are tripping. 
 This is the best seat in the house. 
 Whoo! 
 You know, when I said we should watch the particle accelerator turn on, I just meant we should get naked and howl at the moon. 
 It's already on. 
 Consider me unimpressed. 
 [Distant boom] 
 Whoo! 
 Yeah, baby. 
 Oh. 
 This is awesome. 
 Are you seeing this? 
 Oh, man, I think I am tripping. 
 Oh, man. 
 Get in the car! 
 Get in the car! 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 Farooq! 
 Farooq! 
 Farooq! 
 [Screams] 
 Good day, Dr. Wells. 
 One can always hope, Gideon. 
 Bring up my log, would you? 
 Certainly. 
 Go ahead, doctor. 
 New entry. 
 It has now been 311 days since lightning struck. 
 Subject has begun relying on his speed in everyday life, using his extraordinary powers to solve ordinary problems... 
 [Alarm beeping] 
 I'm late. 
 And accomplish ordinary tasks. 
 Unfortunately, his penchant for the heroic persists. 
 I hate it when they let the new guy train during the morning rush. 
 [People talking at once] 
 Did you get one too? 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 The fact is... 
 Don't try nothing. 
 He can be a bit of a showoff. 
 Wallet. Now. 
 Oh, this is awesome. You've got to be kidding me. 
 Hold on, okay? I'm just gonna... 
 I'm gonna set this down. 
 [Laughs] I mean, this is crazy. 
 There are literally hundreds of thousands of people in Central City, and out of everyone you could have picked to rob, you pick me. 
 What, are you sick? Money, now. 
 I just... You're really gonna be kicking yourself, man. 
 I mean, if there was an Olympics for bad luck, you didn't just medal, pal. 
 You Michael Phelps-ed. 
 I'll count to three. Then I'm gonna shoot you. 
 One... 
 Yeah. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Two. 
 And while his desire to help others is commendable, it is impeding him from realizing the full scope of his abilities. 
 But there's still time, as the future remains intact. 
 Where's Barry? He's late. 
 Late is kind of his signature move. 
 Hey, you guys want to see my signature move? 
 Sorry, guys, I got a little held up. 
 You had to be there. 
 I'm gonna need a moment or two alone with Barry. 
 Ooh, you're in trouble. 
 Now, may I remind you, Mr. Allen, we had an agreement. 
 We would help with your heroics out there while you would help us research and develop your abilities in here, right? 
 Yeah. No, I know. 
 I... I guess I've just gotten a little caught up with being able to help people, you know, put bad guys away. 
 It feels good. 
 Imagine how good it will feel to cure diseases, stop aging, reverse paralysis. 
 All good causes. 
 So how can I help you do that? 
 You need more MRIs, more blood, or... 
 I need more speed. 
 Okay. 
 Speed is the key to progress. 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 You need to kick it up a notch. 
 There was a homicide. 
 I'm sorry. I've got to go. 
 This is not just about you. 
 Remember that, Barry. 
 Yeah. 
 [Exhales] 
 I hope you both skipped your breakfast. 
 Whoa. 
 What the hell could do that? 
 2,400 degrees, give or take. 
 This area's filled with combustibles. 
 How come nothing else burned up? 
 Where you going? 
 You see the soot on the ground where the cement is burnt? 
 Yeah. 
 That's evidence of arc blasts. 
 Happens when high-amperage currents travel or arc through the air. 
 There's no live wires. 
 There's no utility poles. 
 So how was this guy electrocuted? 
 Well, the first thing we need to do is ID him. 
 Yeah. 
 His face is melted off. 
 How's that picture gonna help ID him? 
 I got mad skills. 
 Please don't ever say that again. 
 All right. 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. Why? 
 I don't know. You seem a little off. 
 No, I'm fine. 
 All right. 
 Facial recognition software... it's designed for archeologists, and it should help us ID your crispy corpse. 
 The question is, how did he get fried in the first place? 
 Is there a metahuman out there that can control electricity? 
 It'd take a serious electrostatic discharge to cause that level of tissue damage. 
 Guys, according to the software, there's an 82% chance your victim looked like this. 
 82%? 
 Hey, it was zero when you walked in here, pal. 
 Can you cross-reference that with the DMV database, maybe get a name? 
 Absolutely. 
 This software can do just about anything now that Felicity reprogrammed it. 
 Casey Donahue. 
 No wife. No kids. 
 Used to work at the Petersburg electrical substation. 
 That can't be a coincidence. 
 That's weird. 
 Someone just used his ID To enter the substation. 
 The Petersburg grid is experiencing a power drain right now. 
 Barry, be... 
 Careful. 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 I'm pretty sure this is a restricted area. 
 Easy there, Zappy. 
 I have to feed. 
 Whoa, what was that? 
 More of that. 
 I need more. 
 Barry, what's happening? 
 [Screams] 
 Too much. 
 Too much. 
 Get out of there. 
 Run, Barry. 
 I can't. 
 My speed... is gone. 
 He runs slow even for a normal person. 
 You can't just lose your powers, okay? 
 Your DNA was transformed by the particle accelerator blast. 
 There's no way to untransform DNA. 
 Yeah, tell that to the uber driver who charged me 65 bucks to take me here. 
 I had to tell her I was coming from a cosplay party. 
 So we were wrong. 
 This metahuman doesn't electrocute people; he siphons electricity, thereby removing your power. 
 All right, do we think this is temporary or... we have to run tests. 
 Yeah. 
 I've got to warn Joe. 
 Barry, we will find a way to restore your speed. 
 I promise you that. 
 You didn't catch it. 
 I loved that mug. 
 And what part of “a metahuman stole my speed” didn't you understand? 
 Barry, there's no part of anything you can do that I ever understand. 
 What does Dr. Wells say? 
 He's working on it. 
 Barry, you have to get your speed back. 
 People in this city need protecting, and if you don't get your speed, how the hell are we gonna keep them safe? 
 Joe, the meta who stole my speed, he burned up the body we saw in the alley today. 
 You need to tell the police not to confront him. 
 He's dangerous. 
 Who's dangerous? 
 No one, just some thief. 
 Well, criminals better watch out. 
 Cops in Central City are the best there are, and if you can't protect this city, dad, I know The Flash will. 
 What if he can't? 
 What if he's gone? 
 Gone? 
 Yeah, or maybe he's just done, or maybe it's like whatever he could do before, he can't do anymore. 
 Huh? 
 Barry? 
 Don't you have someplace to be? 
 Yeah, going. 
 Aw, Barry loved that mug. 
 That's a quality time piece, young man. 
 Oh, uh thanks. 
 They took mine, all of them. 
 I guess you shouldn't have done whatever it is you did. 
 Come on. 
 Gideon, show me the future. 
 Certainly, doctor. 
 Run a complete search. 
 Show any references to The Flash. 
 Zero references to The Flash. 
 Look again. 
 Zero references. 
 Show any references to Barry Allen. 
 Zero references to Barry Allen. 
 Look again! 
 I've searched 3,452 times, Dr. Wells. 
 There's nothing. 
 You think I'll ever wear it again? 
 I hope so. 
 I didn't have my speed for very long, but now that it's gone, it feels like part of me is gone too. 
 With or without your speed, you're still you, Barry. 
 But I'm not. 
 I'm not the best version of me. 
 I love being The Flash. 
 I love everything about it: The feeling of running hundreds of miles per hour, wind and power just rushing past my face, being able to help people. 
 I'm not sure I can live without it, Caitlin. 
 Farooq Gibran. 
 Who? 
 The powers vampire who jacked your speed. 
 I hacked into the surveillance footage from the Petersburg substation. 
 Once I got his face, it was easy to find a match. 
 He climbed an electrical tower the night of the accelerator explosion. 
 No surprise where his powers came from. 
 [Alarm beeping] 
 Oh, you've got to be kidding me. 
 This is not happening. 
 Dr. Harrison Wells, I need to see you! 
 Come on, I know you're inside. 
 Open the door. 
 I just want to talk, Dr. Wells. 
 Wells! 
 Let me in! 
 Joe. 
 Hello, Iris. 
 I am out. 
 I need you to cover for me until the shift change. 
 Only one headline, prison transfer, William Tockman. 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [People scream] 
 Guns on the floor! 
 It should take you less than three seconds to discard any thought of rebellion and comply. 
 I take it I don't need to count out loud. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Hmm. 
 Striking resemblance. 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 He's inside. 
 Captain, Tockman has at least ten hostages. 
 Two officers down. 
 Copy that. When is the power back? 
 We're on gennies for now. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Not now. 
 Wait. 
 Captain Singh, I've been trying to get in touch with Joe or anyone at the precinct. 
 There's a hostage situation, Barry, and Joe's inside. 
 So's his daughter. 
 I'll call you when I know more. 
 Wait... 
 [Line clicks] 
 Joe and Iris are in trouble. 
 I need my powers back now. 
 I have a theory. 
 It's untested. 
 I'm willing to roll the dice. 
 Okay, you've lost your speed, yes, but nothing has changed inside you on a subatomic level. 
 In other words, your cells are still primed. 
 They just need a jumpstart. 
 Okay, how do we do that? How do we jumpstart me? 
 We need to replicate the initial jolt to your system. 
 But that would mean a peak current of at least 20,000 kilo-amps. 
 Are you insane? 
 That's more electricity than they give to people in the electric chair. 
 Caitlin, with Farooq in the building, we're all looking at a death sentence here. 
 The spare generator's offline. 
 If we reboot it, we could get a charge that big. 
 We need something that can transmit the load from the generator to Barry's body without shorting out. 
 The treadmill. 
 My baby could take the charge. 
 What if Barry can't? 
 Well, that's up to Mr. Allen. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm gonna talk to him. 
 No. No. 
 Okay, you didn't see him at the substation. 
 He needed to feed. 
 I got super speed out of the particle accelerator blast, but his best friends died. 
 He woke up with a disease. 
 Earlier today, you worked a crime scene where this metahuman electrocuted an innocent man. 
 He's a murderer! 
 And you are powerless to defend yourself against him. 
 He may just need help like I did. 
 I don't need my powers to offer him that. 
 I have to try. 
 Tockman? 
 Tockman. 
 Tockman! 
 I am presently in control of eight of Central City's finest, three underpaid assistants, and one very brave civilian girl. 
 You've got demands; I want to hear them. But first let the civilians go. 
 Would you prefer I sent them out alive or dead? 
 Please be more specific. 
 One helicopter, one vegetarian takeout meal, one laptop with eight gigabytes of RAM will be delivered on this roof at exactly 53 minutes and 27 seconds from now, or I shoot a hostage. 
 
 
 
 There is a citywide blackout. 
 I'm gonna need more time. 
 Captain, you may delay, but time will not. 
 Benjamin Franklin. 
 Very good, detective. 
 Hey, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa, whoa, easy. 
 I'm not gonna hurt you. 
 You can't hurt me. 
 Where is Harrison Wells? 
 Look, I know what happened to you. 
 The night of the accelerator explosion, it changed you. 
 It changed me too. 
 You were the one in the red suit. 
 I fed from you. 
 I have to keep feeding. 
 All right, I know this has to be terrifying. 
 That's why I want to help you, okay? 
 The night of the explosion, when the light hit me, it stopped my heart. 
 Jake and Darya... they were your friends. 
 I woke up, and they were beside me, dead. 
 They tried to give me CPR. 
 They were touching me, and I electrocuted them. 
 This is not your fault. 
 I know. 
 Wells did this to me. 
 Farooq, you need to listen to me. 
 Not sure how long that will hold. 
 Done being noble, Mr. Allen? 
 Caitlin, get him to the treadmill. 
 Cisco, bring the generator online. 
 Make sure Barry gets the charge. 
 What? You're not coming with me? 
 I am not leaving you. 
 Listen to me. 
 Of everything I've done in my life, of everything I have invented, my most important creation is The Flash. 
 Barry Allen must have a future. 
 Now, go. 
 Go! 
 End this now, and I'll talk to the D.A. 
 It was your district attorney that denied me furlough so I could visit my dying sister one last time, say goodbye to her in person. 
 That's time I'll never get back! 
 So however long I have in this life, I promise not one second more will be spent in a prison cell. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Got him. 
 [Gunshots] - Eddie! 
 [Screams] 
 Eddie. Eddie, Eddie. 
 An officer was just shot 9.2 seconds ago. 
 I'd pick up the pace in meeting my demands, Captain. 
 I'm not healing fast anymore. 
 That's unfortunate. 
 Don't worry. 
 When Dr. Wells has a theory, he's usually right. 
 What if something happens to Joe and Iris first? 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 Come to check on your pet? 
 Why don't you just kill me, huh? 
 Get it over with. 
 Quid pro quo. 
 That's Latin, Mr. Woodward. 
 You've heard of Latin? 
 Quid pro quo means something for something, and in this case that something is your freedom. 
 I'm prepared to grant it to you. 
 How do you know I won't kill you? 
 Let's call that a calculated risk, one I'm willing to take. 
 Really? 
 That's right. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Because there is another metahuman loose in this facility. 
 I want you to kill him. 
 Did you know the human body generates electricity? 
 The average person gives off 342 watts, and I can smell it coming from you. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 Turn on the treadmill. 
 You're still hurt. 
 We don't have time! 
 Been dying to punch somebody. 
 Ouch. 
 Caitlin! 
 I can't. 
 We don't have a choice. 
 If I turn this on, it could kill you. 
 If you don't, we could all die. 
 I already lost someone I cared about in this building. 
 I can't do it again. 
 Listen, someone once told me that I was struck by that lightning for a reason, that it chose me. 
 I'm not sure I believe it. 
 Right now, it doesn't matter what I believe. 
 What do you believe? 
 Come on. 
 [Grunts] 
 My God, are you okay? 
 Did you feel anything? 
 It didn't work. 
 [Loud boom] 
 Please, he's bleeding. 
 You have to let us get him some help. 
 You'll stay where you are. 
 And while you're killing time, he's bleeding out. 
 [Laughs] 
 As if you could kill time without wounding eternity. 
 Henry David Thoreau. 
 Ooh, good. 
 A little battlefield trick. 
 Eddie. 
 [Screams] 
 If he lives long enough to receive medical treatment, they'll know the exact time the tourniquet was applied. 
 What? No “thank you”? 
 They call you the clock king, right? 
 A somewhat florid appellation, but I've grown to see the humor in it. 
 You're going back to prison. 
 Really? [Laughs] 
 And... And how do you reckon? 
 Because The Flash is coming. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, where are you? 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 Tony. 
 Hey, Tony, what are you doing? 
 Oh, come on. You know me, Allen. 
 I never run from a fight. 
 All right, well, stay with me, okay? 
 You're good. 
 Run. 
 What? 
 Hey, Tony. 
 No. 
 [Gasps] Barry. 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 Early. 
 You ever seen the city at night by helicopter? 
 It's quite spectacular. 
 You're winded. That's not good. 
 I need to take your blood and figure out what happened. 
 I can't believe he's dead. 
 Dr. Wells? 
 No, no. Tony woodward. 
 He escaped from the pipeline. 
 He must have got out when the blackout hit. 
 Not possible. 
 The pipeline was designed to withstand a power outage. 
 Someone had to have let him go. 
 I did. 
 I released him. 
 Why? 
 To divert our intruder's attention while we worked to restore your speed. 
 You used him as a distraction? 
 An unnecessary one, as it turns out. 
 It seems the plan has failed. 
 I... 
 I have his blood on me. 
 How could you do that? 
 You're showing a lot of sentiment for a man who tormented you as a child. 
 Tony might have been a bully then and now, but he didn't deserve to die. 
 Does Caitlin or Cisco or me or you? 
 I had a choice to make, him or us. 
 I chose us without a second thought. 
 Well, all your talk about miracle cures and scientific breakthroughs, but you don't care about people at all. 
 Well, maybe you care too much, Barry. 
 I know being a hero is important to you, and I respect your ideals. 
 I just don't have the luxury of sharing them. 
 I forgot. 
 Your game's chess. 
 We're all just pawns to you, right? 
 So what's your move, doctor? 
 Which one of us gets sacrificed next? 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 We have to get out of the facility. 
 We just left him on D level. 
 We'll never make it to the main entrance from here. 
 What about the garage, the mobile lab van? 
 It's my move, Mr. Allen, and I say we make a run for it. 
 Oh, my God. Barry, look. 
 Your cells, they're rapidly regenerating. 
 I still don't have my speed. 
 It must be mental, not physical. 
 Oh, you have the yips. 
 The whats? 
 You know. 
 When a second baseman all of a sudden can't throw to first or a golfer tries to putt and they get all embarrassed and upset, and then that makes the yips worse, and it's a hot mess, and then they feel like even more of a failure. 
 That's not helping. 
 Look, you asked if I believed you were struck by lightning for a reason, if you were chosen. 
 I believe. 
 You should too. 
 [Loud boom] 
 Let's move. 
 Tockman, no. 
 No, don't do this, not her. 
 No, take me, please. 
 Something tells me you will not be a docile passenger. 
 She will. 
 Dad. Dad. 
 Wait, wait! Let her say goodbye. 
 This is her boyfriend lying here dying, and I think you and me both know that he probably won't make it. 
 It's wrong that you didn't get to say goodbye to your sister. 
 Give them what you deserved. 
 You have 20 seconds. 
 Eddie. Eddie. 
 Sorry, babe. 
 No, please. 
 You have to hang on for me, okay? 
 I'm gonna be right back. 
 [Whispers] 
 Let's go. 
 Second van, keys are inside. 
 Come on. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Get in! Come on! 
 Come on. 
 He's here. 
 Barry. 
 Quickly. 
 Time and tide wait for no man. 
 Wait, let her say goodbye. 
 You have 20 seconds. 
 Ankle holster. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 [Gunshot] 
 Iris! 
 Oh, my God, are you okay? 
 I'm okay. Come on. 
 Did he hit you? 
 I'm okay. 
 Guys. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. No, please. 
 Hey! 
 You're here for me. 
 Finally you show your face. 
 Well, I wasn't exactly eager to be killed. 
 Neither were my friends. 
 I know. 
 I hurt a lot of people that night. 
 People? 
 You don't even know their names. 
 Jake Davenport. 
 Darya Kim. 
 Ralph Dibny, Al Rothstein, Grant Emerson, Will Everett, Bea Da Costa, Ronnie Raymond. 
 I know the names of every person who died that night. 
 I know they all mattered, and the fact that the world is now deprived of their potential is something that I have to live with every day, but these people... These people have done nothing wrong. 
 You want to punish me? 
 Fine, let's do that, but let these people live. 
 You died that night too. 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 No! 
 You just didn't know it till today. 
 [Screaming] 
 [Panting] 
 Iris. 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 We could have called him “Blackout.” 
 He had a name, Cisco. 
 I'm just not sure what happened. 
 Why didn't he just siphon all my powers like before? 
 Because you finally stopped thinking about your powers and just connected to them. 
 Look, this is a sample of your blood from just after you were struck by lightning. 
 Now your cells are generating more energy than ever before. 
 It was more energy than the meta could safely handle. 
 It's almost like he choked on you. 
 But what does that mean? 
 It means you've kicked it up a notch. 
 Dr. Wells. 
 What I said about how you don't care about people, I... 
 No, look, Barry. 
 There is a reason that my biography describes me as arrogant, prickly, brusque... 
 “at times contemptuous.” 
 I read it twice. 
 You were right. 
 I don't care much for people, Barry. 
 I find them misinformed, shortsighted. 
 So why do you do what you do? 
 Why get up in the morning? 
 Because I believe in a better future, one that I very much want to see, one that you are a part of. 
 I might not much care for people, Barry, but I care about you. 
 Trauma team to the NICU. Trauma team to the NICU. 
 [Knocks] 
 Hey, Allen. 
 Hey, Eddie. 
 Flowers. 
 That's so nice. [Giggles] 
 Where were you all night? 
 Home, trying to eat all the ice cream before it melted. 
 I love ice cream. [Laughs] 
 He is on pain meds, lots of them, but he's gonna be okay. 
 It's been some night. 
 I am gonna get some coffee. 
 I'll be back. 
 Dude. 
 Awesome. 
 I guess you're feeling better. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Did you guys see that? 
 You're just high, partner. 
 Right, I forgot. [Laughs] 
 Oh, now you show up. 
 I'm sorry I wasn't there for you today. 
 It couldn't be helped. 
 It's okay. 
 A girl's got to be her own hero every now and again. 
 I promise I'll never be late again. 
 My best friend is always saying that, and he is always late. 
 You're worth being on time for. 
 Honey, you all right? 
 Yeah, why? 
 You forgot your coffee. 
 Oh, uh... 
 Good day, Dr. Wells. 
 Yes, it is, Gideon. 
 Bring up my log, please, new entry. 
 It has now been 312 days since lightning struck. In the past 24 hours, subject has taken a great leap forward, causing me to revise my initial thesis. I thought... Well, I thought his attachment to people was a distraction slowing down his progress. Now I realize the opposite is true. Barry's attachment to people, the people he cares about, is actually the key to getting him up to speed. In the meantime, good news. The future remains intact. 
 You're early. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It feels weird to me too. 
 I thought after yesterday, you'd want to sleep in. 
 Can't. There's too much work to do. 
 I'm ready to do it. 
 I want to push myself, find out how fast I can really go. 
 You were right. 
 This is not just about me. 
 Let's get to work. 
 Now, you... Had the ability to steal The Flash's powers, and I... Would love to know... How you did that.
