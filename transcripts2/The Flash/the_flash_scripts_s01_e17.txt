 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. 
 When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 My father went to prison for her murder. 
 Then an accident made me the impossible. 
 To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. 
 And one day, I'll find who killed my mother... 
 Mom! 
 And get justice for my father. 
 I am The Flash. 
 Previously on The Flash... 
 You're him. The Reverse-Flash. 
 I'm Eobard Thawne. 
 And the Flash's speed is the key to my returning to my time. 
 I've been teamed up with Mason Bridge, who is a legend. 
 You're the guy who thinks Harrison Wells is some mad genius? 
 What do you know about him? 
 I think that maybe you were right about Dr. Wells. 
 Which part? 
 All of it. 
 Come on. 
 Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy. 
 Mom! 
 Barry, no! 
 Mom! 
 Get back! 
 Mom! 
 All right, this is everything that we know about Harrison Wells, which is actually not a lot. 
 Didn't you read a whole book about him? 
 Yeah, 600 pages, and the big takeaway is, he's enigmatic. 
 Your mom was killed by a speedster. 
 Wells' machine turned you into a speedster. 
 That's way too many coincidences for this old cop. 
 Do you think that he wanted me to become The Flash? 
 Everything he's done since that night you got struck by lightning... bringing you to S.T.A.R. Labs, giving you the suit, training you... it's all been to keep you safe. 
 And to make me faster. 
 Wells once said that he needed more speed from me. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 But he wants something from you, Barry. 
 We just need to figure out what it is. 
 Well, let's go get him then. Let's get some answers. 
 We can't do that now as much as we might want to. 
 Joe, you had your suspicions about Wells from the very beginning. 
 You thought that he might be the man in yellow. 
 Except the blood from your house didn't match him. 
 All right, so maybe he's not the Reverse-Flash, but you think that he knows what happened that night. 
 He may have the key to getting my dad out of prison. 
 Whatever Wells wants from you, it started 15 years ago. 
 He's been patient. 
 Scary patient. 
 You gotta listen to me on this. 
 We have to be just as patient. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Wow. Look. 
 Wow. 
 Henry? 
 Henry! 
 Henry! 
 Henry! 
 Henry? 
 Nice name. 
 Tricked ya. 
 Look who's back. 
 My tricks. My treat. 
 But I'll give you something good to eat. 
 Today's special. A city in ashes. 
 The Trickster proudly welcomes you all to the new disorder. 
 Talking in the third person. That's never a good sign. 
 You're just mad because he named himself. 
 Actually, he didn't. 
 20 years ago, Central City was hit by a series of terrorist attacks. 
 One man killed at least ten civilians, two cops. 
 That guy called himself The Trickster. 
 Whoa. Someone was rocking the unitard. 
 James Jesse? 
 Like Jesse James, only more twisted. 
 Where is this Mr. Jesse now? 
 He's serving several life sentences at Iron Heights. 
 He was just about the most dangerous thing Central City had ever seen. 
 You mean until the Particle Accelerator blew up. 
 Um... 
 Barry and I will go see this James Jesse at Iron Heights, see if he can give us something that can help us catch his groupie. 
 I'll analyze the video and see if I can figure out the source. 
 Hey, Joe. 
 Is Barry doing all right? He seems cranky. 
 Even The Flash wakes up on the wrong side of the bed some mornings. 
 He's fine. 
 Mom! 
 Nora, hold on! 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 Gideon, what's happening to me? 
 Your latest time jump against The Flash caused a massive drain on your powers. 
 Your cells contain no trace of The Speed Force. 
 That's impossible. 
 Your ability to move at super-speed as well as travel in time has been completely depleted. 
 How am I supposed to get back? 
 You can't. 
 Never seen this part of the prison before. 
 Yeah, I had to have this cell specially built for James Jesse about five years ago. 
 Why is that? 
 A criminal psychologist set up weekly visits with him. 
 James talked the shrink into committing suicide. 
 Oh, you're gonna need these. 
 Okay. 
 Gentlemen. 
 Please, be seated. 
 I'm Detective Joe West. This is Barry Allen. 
 Uh, we'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 Mmm. 
 I can smell them in your pocket. 
 Mmm. 
 Yesterday, hundreds of these parachute bombs were released throughout Central City. 
 Huh. 
 Fun idea, but not an effective delivery system. 
 How many died? 
 No one, luckily. 
 You know, when I was free and at my height, a day without casualties was like... well, like the Cubs winning the pennant... it just never happened. 
 The explosives they found in all the parachute bombs had the same explosive composition as the bombs you set off 20 years ago. 
 That's impossible. 
 I never told anyone that formula. 
 The signatures are an exact match. 
 He called himself The Trickster too, just like you. 
 He is nothing like me, Detective. 
 Nothing! 
 Do you know who he is? 
 Oh. 
 If I did, I would tell you, so you could find him, cut off his head, and throw it right in his face. 
 No, this is obviously the work of a rank amateur at best. 
 A mere pretender angling for my throne. 
 I hear you. 
 So... help us catch him. 
 Prove there's only one Trickster. 
 Trying to trick The Trickster, Joseph, hmm? 
 No. 
 There's only one way this could happen. 
 Whoever he is, he must have found my lair. 
 I ask only one thing, when you find this schtick stealer, this gimmick grabber, this pathetic wannabe, fake, make sure your safety's off. 
 Something has happened to Mason Bridge. 
 No one has seen or heard from him in a week. 
 Well, he's a journalist, Iris. Maybe he's on a story. 
 Then why hasn't he answered his phone or his emails? 
 Maybe he stumbled on the wrong story and he's laying low. 
 You don't know him like I do, Eddie. 
 When Mason is on a story, nothing is getting in his way. 
 I mean, he considers threats minor annoyances. 
 Then maybe he's on a bender or he met a girl worth disappearing for a week over. 
 Look, he also said that something weird was going on at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 Eddie, something has happened to him. 
 Something bad. I can feel it. 
 Please. 
 Look, Captain Singh has everyone on the Central City Park bomber. 
 But as soon as I can, I'll look into Bridge. 
 I promise. 
 Okay. 
 This looks like nobody's been here since the '90s. 
 Yeah, look at this thing. 
 You really think Jesse doesn't know who this new Trickster guy is? 
 He seemed pretty ticked off that someone was besmirching his bad name. 
 Joe. 
 Let's see what he's got stashed in there. 
 Yeah. 
 Damn. 
 You good? 
 The copycat... he took everything. 
 Hey, c-can we have a second? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Just... 
 Dad. Hey. 
 Barry. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Uh, Joe and I have some questions for an inmate about a bombing case. 
 Dad, listen, I'm close. 
 The man that put you in here... 
 I'm getting close, closer than I've ever been. 
 Barry, we have talked about this. 
 I know, and I'm done talking. 
 You're not gonna pay for another man's crime anymore. 
 Just hang in there, okay? 
 Joe, what's he talking about? 
 Like he said, Henry, just hang in there. 
 What? No candy, fellas? 
 That storage space you sent us to was booby-trapped. 
 You can never be too careful with your private things. 
 You were protecting nothing. 
 Your secret stash was empty. 
 What do you mean? 
 No firearms, none of your explosives, nothing. 
 Whatever you had in there, it was stolen, all of it. 
 No. He's stealing my legacy. 
 Whoever this is, you need to find him. 
 I will not let this... this... 
 Trickster? 
 That is my name! Mine! 
 What was in that room? What were you keeping there? 
 A bomb. A really big bomb. 
 How big? 
 Bye-bye, Central City. 
 Cisco. 
 Yo, this Trickster guy just posted a vlog. 
 You gotta see this. 
 I'm sending you the link right now. 
 Okay. 
 Denizens of Central City, or those of you who remain, welcome to Boom Day. 
 I'm very proud to report that my first trick was an exploding success. 
 Show him. 
 But I think you all deserve something much, uh, bigger. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 So for my next trick... 
 Take off my mask, you fraud. 
 Keep your eyes glued... 
 Pretender. Sham. 
 Take off my mask. 
 Take off my mask. 
 Take off my mask! 
 This was posted a few hours ago. 
 Whoever this Trickster is, he's certainly not shy. 
 Well, not every criminal likes to hide in the dark. 
 Cisco, can you trace where the video was posted from? 
 I tried, but this guy is using some crazy Felicity-caliber scrambler like I've never seen. 
 The origin of the upload's coming from hundreds of different locations. 
 Until he uploads another video, it's gonna be tough. 
 This psychopath has the capability to destroy the city. 
 Hey, I said tough, not impossible. 
 Barry, we'll catch him. We always do. 
 Mr. Allen, a word please? 
 I know what's going on with you. 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 Do you? 
 I know going up to Iron Heights prison and conversing with Mr. Jesse has brought about feelings of your father. 
 How could it not? 
 Yeah, no, it's, uh, it's been really tough knowing that my mom's killer is still out there. 
 Of course. 
 But we'll find him, together. 
 You have my word. 
 Thank you. 
 For now, how about we focus on finding this Trickster before anybody else gets hurt? 
 I have to go. 
 But thanks for the pep talk. 
 I'm always here for you. 
 Research laboratories unconnected to the government, unconnected to any business interests or any of that kind of stuff. 
 And then we build right downtown in the heart of the city, in the epicenter, and we become the heart of the city. 
 We become the heart of the nation. 
 We change the way you think about the sciences, and then... 
 What? 
 Just that my father would have loved you... as much as I do. 
 Well, I wish I could have met him. 
 Oh. 
 And what would you call these laboratories? 
 Well, we, Tess Morgan, would call them “The Technological Engineering Scientific Studies,” or T.E.S.S., for short. 
 Well, that is very, very sweet. 
 But how about... 
 “Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories” or S.T.A.R. Labs, for short? 
 Because in the vast night sky, you, Harrison Wells, are the only star I see. 
 That's gonna get you kissed. 
 I thought you were a full-time reporter now. 
 Why are we meeting here? 
 I still have a key. 
 And this is kind of our place, right? 
 What's up? 
 My coworker Mason Bridge is missing. 
 He's not at home. He's not answering his phone. 
 I mean, it's not like him. 
 I am really worried that something bad has happened. 
 I'm sure he's fine. 
 That's what Eddie says. That's what everyone is saying. 
 Please, will you look into it? 
 For me? 
 For you. 
 Thanks. 
 Um, are you okay? 
 You seem like you have a heavy heart. 
 Sometimes I'm not sure why I wear a mask with you. 
 Well, maybe one day you'll take it off. 
 Heads up. Trickster's broadcasting again. 
 Can I borrow your laptop? 
 Um, sure. Help... 
 Help yourself. 
 Get ready for the games to begin! 
 I have...a bomb. 
 It's a big bomb. 
 It'll make a big bang and then a big hole and then a big drop in the pop-ulation. 
 But never say The Trickster is not fair. 
 The bomb is somewhere between 52nd Street and Avenue B. 
 I want all units, every uniform, every detective searching that area right now. 
 Somehow we need to alert The Flash. 
 Something tells me he already knows. 
 Guys, I can't find it. I need your help. 
 There's nothing on traffic cams or CCTV. 
 I retasked the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to scan the area for incendiary devices. 
 A bomb that large should be giving off some kind of thermal or chemical signature. 
 Well, then why can't you find it? 
 Because it's a trick. 
 The bomb's not there. 
 No, it has to be. I'm gonna keep looking. 
 That is what he wants, for you and the police to keep running around in circles. 
 There is something else going on, Barry. 
 I can feel it. Now, trust me. 
 I'm gonna keep looking. 
 Barry? 
 Why doesn't he just listen to you? 
 I found it. 
 Uh-oh, there's an explosion at Iron Heights. 
 This was all a diversion. 
 The prison was the real target. 
 James Jesse. 
 I guess he's tricked us all. 
 Joe, there's no bomb in this city. 
 It was a diversion so The Trickster could help James Jesse escape. 
 I know. 
 We just got surveillance footage from Iron Heights. 
 Jesse got away. 
 
 
 
 Barry, look, they took a hostage. 
 Well, who did he take? A guard? The warden? 
 No. Your dad. 
 You have to admit, that was one hell of a trick. 
 I cannot believe we're finally in the same room. 
 I mean, you're my hero. 
 You need a better role model, kid. 
 Can't you see? He's just using you. 
 Why did we bring him along? Huh? 
 Because his son works for the CCPD. 
 Should we find ourselves in a jam, a cop's dad makes an excellent bargaining chip. 
 Right. 
 I wouldn't worry too much about what the cops might do to you. 
 Really? 
 If the police aren't able to find you, trust me, The Flash will. 
 Here's hoping. 
 So what's next? 
 In your last letter, you said you had something big in mind for when you got out. 
 I've had 20 years to come up with the perfect trick. 
 It's going to be my masterpiece. 
 My Mona Lisa. 
 My Breaking Bad season five. 
 They gave me cable in prison so I'd stop killing the guards. 
 Right. 
 There's just one thing I've been dying to ask. 
 Why did you choose me? 
 Because I knew you had the strength to fulfill my legacy. 
 Besides, it was in your blood. 
 Wait. 
 What do you mean in... in my blood? 
 The real reason I tracked you down and groomed you to be the best you could possibly be, Axel... 
 I am your father. 
 We were able to identify the other Trickster. 
 His name's Axel Walker, age 25. 
 Apparently him and James have been corresponding through snail mail for over a decade. 
 I should have been there. 
 We're gonna find your dad, okay? 
 Definitely. 
 I guess I should have listened to you. 
 Sorry, I am so tired. 
 I think I'm just gonna put on my pajamas, go straight to bed when we get home. 
 Really? 
 No. 
 Definitely not wearing pajamas. 
 Hello. 
 No, no, no. Tess. 
 Tess. Tess! Oh, no. 
 Oh, no. Tess. Tess. 
 Oh, thank God. You gotta help me. 
 Please help me. Oh. 
 She... she's... 
 What are you doing? What are you doing? 
 Help. Call someone! Call anyone! 
 Can't you see she's dying? 
 This woman has been dead for centuries. 
 Help! 
 You okay? 
 Do you think my dad is still alive? 
 Yes. Yes, he is. Of course. 
 Jesse only took your pop to use as leverage. 
 He might be crazy, but he's not stupid. 
 And everyone upstairs is looking to find him. 
 So now I'm supposed to just leave my dad's fate in the hands of a man who may have had something to do with my mom's murder. 
 Joe, I can't do this. 
 Yes, you can. 
 It just doesn't make any sense. 
 I mean, if Wells is a murderer, then why does he want to help me? 
 Why has he helped me stop so many criminals? 
 Or saved Ronnie? 
 Why didn't I see this? 
 I spent 1/10 as much time with him as you did, and he almost had me believing in him. 
 Almost. 
 Look, whatever else he is, he is Harrison Wells. 
 You love science. He is science. 
 It's like you made best friends with Einstein. 
 You're saying I wanted to be tricked. 
 You always want to be the person who sees the best in people. 
 I've been a cop for 25 years. 
 All I can see is the flaws, the lies, the dark thoughts that people think I don't see. 
 I wish I could be you. 
 As fast as you are, that is your real power. 
 Don't let Wells take that from you. 
 I don't know why he's helping us. 
 All that matters is that he is. 
 I can't lose my dad, Joe. 
 Barr. 
 Barr, come on. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Hi. Iris West, I'm with Central City Picture News. 
 Thanks. 
 Champagne, miss? 
 Oh, thank you. 
 We're almost out of champagne. 
 Then the fun's about to begin. 
 Oh, Mayor Bellows, hi. 
 This is a lovely party. 
 Thank you. 
 Welcome, welcome, Central City's finest. 
 How about a toast to Mayor Anthony Bellows? 
 He doesn't just yell at his staff, he bellows! 
 You see what I did there with the wordplay and the... 
 Tough crowd. 
 Excuse me. 
 Who are you? 
 How quickly they forget. 
 James Jesse, your honor, aka The Trickster. 
 And I'm here to relieve you fine people from all your money. 
 Because we know if you're in this room, you've got loads of it. 
 What makes you think that anyone in this room would give you a cent? 
 Because that champagne they just slurped down like so much fruit punch... 
 I added a little something special to it. 
 Trimethylmercury 32. 
 Poison. 
 Without the antidote, you'll begin to feel the effects in about, oh, um... 
 One hour. 
 One hour. 
 I remember you. 
 You got to the party about an hour early. 
 I offered you the very first glass of champagne. 
 [chuckles] 
 An hour is plenty of time for all of you to call your bankers and transfer everything you have to the account number on the bottom of your glass. 
 Once my young friend and I are rich, you'll get the antidote. 
 If any of you decide to call 911 instead, well, then we switch to lead poisoning. 
 [chuckles] 
 Anything? 
 I'm scanning all the traffic cams in the city. 
 I got nothing. 
 Hey, baby. 
 Iris? [stammers] 
 What's up? 
 James : How many of you feel the Trimethyline 32 coursing through your veins, hmm? 
 That's him. That's Jesse. 
 Cisco, can you ping her phone? 
 I'm on it. 
 Trimethylmercury 32 is a relatively fast-acting poison. 
 Is there a cure? 
 Yes. We can start synthesizing the antidote right now. 
 Cisco, where is she? 
 City hall. 
 The mayor's having a fund-raiser there tonight. 
 Barry, do not underestimate The Trickster. 
 [overlapping chatter] 
 Well, hello. 
 You know, I've been in prison for 20 years. 
 Then you'll know the routine when you get sent back. 
 [both grunt] 
 Where's Henry Allen? 
 He's where you'll be soon. 
 Heaven! 
 [chuckles] 
 Are you familiar with the movie  Speed? 
 Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock? 
 See, you're the bus, and that's the bomb. 
 A kinetic bomb, actually, and if you go below 600 miles per hour, it'll explode. 
 Same thing happens if you try to remove it. 
 Ooh, it's active. 
 Run, run, run, run, run. 
 Flash : Cisco! 
 Cisco : He wasn't lying. 
 That thing's linked to a speedometer, and it will blow if you stop moving. 
 I can't run forever. 
 There's gotta be a way to get it off him without damaging it. 
 Barry, do you see any walls nearby? 
 Why? 
 Because I need you to run into one. 
 Or more accurately, through one. 
 both : What? 
 If you vibrate at the natural frequency of air, your body... your cells will be in a state of excitement that should allow you to phase right through that wall, leaving the bomb on the other side. 
 Should? 
 You can do this. 
 I believe in you. 
 I can't. 
 Listen to me, Barry. 
 Breathe. 
 Breathe. e.Feel the air. 
 Feel that wind on your face. 
 Feel the ground, your feet lifting you up, pushing you forward, and the lightning... 
 Barry, feel the lightning. 
 Feel its power. 
 Its electricity pumping through your veins, crackling through you, traveling to every nerve in your body, like a shock. 
 You're no longer you now. 
 You're part of something greater. 
 You're part of a speed-force. 
 It's yours. 
 Now do it. 
 [panting] 
 Oh! 
 Barry? 
 Oh, that felt weird. 
 Oh. 
 I'm good. 
 Ooh, I like it. 
 Look at that. 
 Lobsters on me, kid. 
 It's okay. You've all been given an antidote. 
 That wasn't very sanitary. 
 Now where is Henry Allen? 
 You're going to prison either way, James. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [chuckles] All right. 
 [both laugh] 
 You always did look good in red. 
 [both laughing] 
 Wow. 
 Half of this stuff didn't even exist when I was practicing. 
 Yeah, well, I'd be happy to give you a crash course on all of it if you get out. 
 I'm gonna shut up now. 
 [chuckles] It's okay. 
 Dr. Allen? 
 Yes? 
 I'm feeling the need to give you a hug. 
 Absolutely. I will always accept a hug. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow. You gotta tell me. 
 What does it feel like when you're running down the street like a bat out of hell? 
 There's no feeling like it. 
 I bet. 
 Actually, you're all heroes in my book, especially you, Dr. Wells. 
 Thank you for everything that you've done for my son. 
 Well, your son is an extraordinary man, Dr. Allen, and I will do everything in my power to ensure Barry's future. 
 [gentle music] 
 It's time, Joe. 
 No. 
 No? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 You seem like you could use a hug too. 
 Your father is an extraordinary man. 
 You're lucky to have him. 
 I'm lucky to have you too. 
 Ahh! 
 [grunting] 
 Who are you? 
 My name is Eobard Thawne, but that name doesn't matter. 
 Not anymore. It won't matter for many years. 
 The only thing that really matters is who you are. 
 Harrison Wells. 
 What are you talking about? I don't understand. 
 In the year 2020, you and your wife, Tess Morgan, successfully launched a Particle Accelerator that changed the course of history. 
 I need it to happen a bit sooner if I'm going to get back. 
 Much sooner. 
 What is that? 
 My way home. 
 [police sirens approaching] 
 You see, they're not coming to save you. 
 They're coming to save me. 
 [grunts] 
 [sirens continue] 
 [grunting] 
 [both screaming] 
 [exhales] 
 Hey, Joe. 
 Desk Sergeant said you were looking for me. 
 Eddie, yeah. Uh... 
 Sit down. 
 It's about Iris. 
 She's looking into Mason Bridge's disappearance. 
 We can't let that happen. 
 Detective. 
 Eddie, we need your help. 
 Brazil? 
 Why... why would Mason move to Brazil? 
 Apparently there was a girl involved, and he decided to go hike the Amazon with her for a year, you know, live off the grid, write his memoirs or something. 
 Wow. I guess you really don't know anyone. 
 No, you don't. 
 West : Hey, baby, everything good? 
 Yeah, yeah. Of course. 
 Um, dinner will be ready in a jiff, okay? 
 Okay. 
 She buy it? 
 I think so. 
 Keeping her in the dark, it's for her safety. 
 That is debatable, and we will have that debate. 
 But for right now, what's our next move? 
 How do we figure out what Wells is up to? 
 When Wells was talking me through phasing so I could get the Trickster's bomb off my wrist, the way that he described my being The Flash, running, feeling the wind and the power, it's like he was talking from experience. 
 What are you saying? 
 I don't know how... but he's the man in yellow. 
 Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash. 
 I got an 11-80, possible 10-54, County Road J, requesting immediate assistance. 
 man on radio : Copy that. Units en route to your location. 
 [grunting] 
 Sir, we're gonna get you out of here. 
 Can you tell me your name? 
 Do you know who you are? 
 My name... is... Harrison Wells.
