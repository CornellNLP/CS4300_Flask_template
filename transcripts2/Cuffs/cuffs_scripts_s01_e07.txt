 Police radio : '.. I will assign that to you. Just let me know when you are in state five.' 
 'Any patrols, please, for an immediate graded call to Buckland Parade. Reports that an ATM has been stolen.' 
 'Control, show us state six for that robbery, over.' 
 If you could just tell me what happened, that would be great. 
 Um, there were... Sorry. 
 It's all right, it's all right. Take your time. 
 There were three of them, I think. 
 Description? 
 They had those things, erm... Covering their... 
 Balaclavas? Yeah. 
 Control, this is Kilo Two Three Zero. 
 'We have arrived at Buckland Parade and can confirm an ATM has been stolen.' 
 Some witnesses say they saw a silver pick-up truck leaving the scene with an ATM, with a partial index of Bravo Foxtrot Zero Eight. 
 Priority, this is Kilo Zero One. 
 'I'm behind the silver pick-up suspected of being involved in the ATM raid. I'm in an unmarked vehicle.' 
 The occupants are unaware that I am following. 
 Kilo Zero One, this is the Duty Inspector. 
 You have authority to follow the vehicle covertly. 
 'Other units will be sent to assist you.' 
 Down there. Reckoned he saw everything. 
 'All units, Kilo Zero One is following a silver pick-up believed to be involved in an ATM raid. Please make your way to Berrington Avenue and listen out for commentary.' 
 Is that the Chief Super? 
 The subject vehicle is now heading into Barscroft Road. 
 I need marked vehicles here immediately to get it stopped. 
 Received that, Kilo Zero One. 
 Any Kilo units, please provide an update on your location. Over. 
 Received that, boss. We are en route, ETA three minutes. 
 Suspect vehicle has turned into Croxford car park on Addlesham Road. 
 I suspect they're going to do a vehicle swap. 
 I intend to follow them in and keep obs on them. 
 I need tactical options available. 
 Ask Kilo Zero Three to arrange for a helicopter and a stinger for when they get out. 
 This is Inspector Webb, South Sussex. Priority Call. 
 I request urgent NPAS. 
 'Kilo Zero One,' due to other task, air support is not available for another 20 minutes.' 
 Come on! 
 I've lost visual on the subject vehicle. 
 I need back up here NOW to apprehend them on the exit. 
 Kilo Zero One, I have been rammed by the subject vehicle. 
 My vehicle is severely damaged and I need urgent assistance now. 
 I am on the fourth floor by the ramp. 
 GET DOWN! Put your weapons down! 
 ON THE GROUND! On the ground now! 
 Put down your weapon! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 OK, I'm putting it down. 
 Over there. 
 MOVE! 
 LIE DOWN! 
 Let him go! 
 Now! 
 We're letting him go. 
 We're letting him go. 
 'On the ground. Hands behind your back.' 
 You move, you're dead. 
 This is Kilo Two Three Zero, Priority Call. 
 I'm requesting a Live Cell Trace. 
 ( Sirens wail ) 
 'The force is throwing everything at this raid, so listen up.' 
 Donna's phone's been triangulated to one of these outbuildings. 
 It's a sprawling site, so it's going to be a nightmare to search. 
 Now, as we know, this gang are armed and well aware we're after them. 
 Firearms will go in first to capture the gang, secure the scene. 
 Then -- and only then -- the response teams go in. 
 Away we go. 
 Foxtrot Two to Foxtrot One. In position now. 
 We're just going to have to wait this one out. 
 Spoken to Corey yet? 
 Still at his gran's. 
 Hardly surprising. 
 No, don't do that. 
 I'm not a... homophobic or whatever, yeah. 
 I never had a problem with... you, Donna... 
 Don't like my boyfriend much. 
 That's cos he's a solicitor, not cos he's... 
 What? Say it! You can't catch it just cos you say it. 
 Look, this is different, all right? 
 Corey is young. He's confused. 
 He's had a lot to cope with. His mum died, all right? 
 It's probably just a phase, anyway. 
 A phase? 
 Ryan, just admit it. 
 You're not OK with your son being gay. 
 All right, I'm not. All right? 
 Good. Least you're being honest. 
 How did he react when you told him? 
 Wouldn't know. 
 My dad's never had a real emotion in his life. 
 All units, this is Kilo Zero Three. 
 Three subject males have left the building and are making off in subject vehicle. 
 All units -- strike! Strike! Strike! 
 ARMED POLICE! On the ground! Face down! 
 Put your arms out! Put your arms out! 
 Put your arms out! Bring your hands towards your back! 
 Keep your hands STILL. 
 CLEAR! CLEAR! 
 ( Police sirens ) 
 Hello again. 
 Obviously the priority for CID is to find evidence that links the gang to the thefts, the ATM, money, tools, etc. 
 So split up, bag up anything you think relevant, leave the rest to CSI, who are en route. 
 ( Informal chatter ) 
 Oh, hey, guys! What's going on? 
 ( She chuckles ) 
 We'd better get CSI down here, get some fingerprints off these... 
 ( Radio beeps ) 
 Aargh... Dead spot. 
 Don't touch 'em. 
 ( Bird flaps wings ) 
 ( They grunt ) 
 ( They grunt ) 
 ( He shrieks ) 
 Come here! 
 Ah! 
 Oh, yeah. 
 ( He chuckles ) 
 ( They pant ) 
 [Come here.] 
 ( Radio chatter ) 
 Should get that looked at. 
 Rumble in the jungle, eh? 
 Heard you landed a pretty good punch yourself. 
 Ah, well... 
 What I've lost in speed, I've made up for in accuracy. 
 Look, Jake, I understand your, erm... 
 No. 
 You don't. 
 How much cash is there in an ATM? 
 I don't know, 70, 80 grand? 
 A couple of those a week... 
 Exactly. A nice little earner. 
 Do you fancy it? 
 Yeah, go on, then. 
 ( He chuckles ) 
 DS Moffat. 
 Yes, sir? 
 I want you to be the SIO on this case. 
 If you're ready? 
 Er, yeah. Definitely ready, sir. Yeah. 
 CSI, evidence collection... Custody... Interview strategy. 
 All yours. 
 Thank you, sir. Thanks. 
 (Yes!) 
 ( Camera clicks ) 
 'And I'm telling you now that we have recovered DNA from the inside of this balaclava.' 
 We will be running it against the fingerprints you provided today, and we'll have the test results back in a few days. 
 Are we going to find your DNA on this item? 
 No comment. 
 DC Hawkins, I believe you have another exhibit for us... 
 I do. 
 I am now showing the suspect Exhibit DP0002... a Glock... 9mm pistol. 
 Can you see the gun? 
 No comment. 
 But you can SEE the gun? There's nothing wrong with your eyesight? 
 Detective... 
 It's Detective Sergeant. 
 Are we going to find your fingerprints on this firearm? 
 What are you looking at your solicitor for? 
 It's a simple yes or no question. 
 No comment. 
 Is there any reason for you to have handled this firearm? 
 No... comment. 
 Officers have identified you from your clothing, as having been present when police were threatened with a firearm at the Croxford multistorey car park. 
 Were you there when this incident happened? 
 My client insists he wasn't present. 
 He's adamant this has nothing to do with him. 
 Adamant? He's adamant... 
 Yeah... 
 ( She inhales ) 
 Right, well, we'll leave it there, then. 
 Interview terminated at 1700 hours. 
 I'm just going to make a quick phone call. 
 ( Door opens ) 
 ( Door closes ) 
 That's fantastic! Thank you... 
 All right, will do. Cheers. 
 CPS happy to authorise all charges for all suspects. 
 Get in! 
 Court in the morning, which means they will be remanded in custody and I will be very hungover. 
 HE CHUCKLES - Right, I'm going to go and do the honours, you can round up the troops for the pub. 
 Yeah, you might want to dial back a bit on that smug smile when you charge 'em? 
 Not a chance, I'm turning it up to 11. 
 Got to get your kicks while you can in this job. 
 And you're going to be put forward for a Divisional Commander's Commendation. 
 ( She laughs ) 
 Cheers, boss. 
 Well deserved. 
 Without you, we wouldn't have four dangerous criminals in custody. 
 It was a team effort. 
 Initiated by YOUR quick thinking. 
 You'll get your formal letter in a week, with your invitation to the next ceremony, so keep your eyes peeled... 
 I will. 
 You know this job... 80% a bureaucratic ball-ache. 
 But moments like this... 
 Are you decent? 
 ( Cheering ) 
 Tea and medals! 
 Well done. 
 Cheers. 
 How's your head? Still managed to fit it through the door? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry, I'm not going to let it change me. 
 You're still going to talk to us little people, then, yeah? 
 Yes. If I have time. 
 She's changed! 
 ( Laughter ) 
 Are you coming for a drink? 
 No. 
 OK. See you later, mate. 
 Shall we go? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
 See you later, Ry... 
 Yes. 
 ( Laughter and chattering ) 
 All set? Got your thirst on? 
 Drinking arm at the ready. 
 Argh, I didn't realise that was the time. I promised I'd go home tonight... 
 Oh, come on, you're just having a quick one. 
 Oh, hang on, do you reckon we should invite the boss? 
 To the pub? 
 Yes. 
 Can do, but he'll never say yes. 
 Really? 
 Night, sir. 
 ( They chatter ) 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. No. I'll tell you later. 
 Oh, look who it is. 
 What's this? Travelling en masse? 
 Yes. 
 Just going out for a drink, celebrating the good result with the ATM gang... 
 Maybe I should tag along? 
 You want to come out with a load of cops who are celebrating catching a gang... that you're defending? 
 Sounds fun. 
 ( He scoffs ) 
 No. Nah, not a good idea. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Right, come on, guys. 
 Let's go. 
 ( All jeer ) 
 You going to give me a backie? 
 How old are you? 
 Hey... Does anyone want a lift? 
 Yeah! 
 Actually, you know what? I'm going to head home. 
 I'm going to be late. 
 Oh, come on, this is for you, this is. 
 Hi... 
 I can't. Alice is cooking. 
 I want to tell her about today and... 
 BOO! 
 Guys, actually, I am going to head home. 
 Oh, OK. 
 Have a good one tonight, OK. Behave yourselves! 
 Take car, be safe. 
 See ya. 
 This is nice. 
 Watch your clothes. Had a Corgi in here earlier. 
 Shed like a b*st*rd. 
 ( Door opens ) 
 Hi. How was your day? 
 Really good. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Debbie? 
 Debbie? 
 And then it was like... I just didn't think. 
 I just chucked it over as they... As they drove off. 
 And it was only afterwards that I actually realised what I'd done...! 
 And I was shaking... after. My hand was going like this... 
 But it wasn't shock, like, erm... 
 Like after an RTC or, or something like that... It was... 
 It was adrenaline. It was a rush. 
 It was amazing. 
 Mm. Babe, this is delicious. Thank you so much. 
 You not eating anything? 
 I'm not hungry. 
 You all right? What's wrong? 
 You know, the fact that you have to ask, that's... 
 That's the most upsetting thing of all. 
 I've lost my appetite. And I... 
 I don't know whether I want to throw up, or... cry... 
 Are you sick? 
 No, I'm not. 
 Yeah, actually yes, yes, I am -- I am sick. 
 I'm sick of worrying about you every time you go to work. 
 I'm sick of freaking out every time the phone rings cos it might be the station, or... 
 Or the hospital, saying something's happened to you... 
 Al, I'm fine! 
 How can you say that after what happened to you today? 
 You had someone pull a gun on you! You nearly died... 
 But I didn't. 
 But you could've done! 
 And you're sat there, talking about it like it's... 
 Like it's the most exciting thing in the world. Listen to yourself -- 
 "the rush, the buzz..." 
 I don't think it's exciting that you nearly got killed. 
 I'm really proud of what I did today. 
 No, that's not... I'm not... 
 Sorry. 
 I'm sorry... 
 I wasn't saying that to scare you. 
 Well, you have. 
 And I'm sorry if you wanted to have a lovely romantic evening where you get to talk about staring down the barrel of a gun and the... 
 The thrill of the chase. But I'm going to bed. 
 Alice, come on... 
 I don't know how much longer I can do this. 
 Alice? 
 Alice, please don't do this. 
 Alice? 
 ( Door shuts ) 
 There we go... 
 ( Cheering ) 
 ( Laughter and chat ) 
 ( Score over dialogue ) 
 ( Score continues ) 
 Oh, like the shades. Heavy night? 
 What's the matter with you? 
 I really don't want to talk about it, mate. 
 Suit yourself. 
 I'll tell you something, though. 
 Everything you've ever been told about Irish girls in bed is true. 
 Wild. Mental. She tried to put her finger... 
 Lino... I cannot spend another day listening to you blathering on about Orla. All right? 
 All right! Blimey. 
 Morning! Oh... 
 From the bleary eyes, it's clear to see that most of us are still recovering from celebrating PC Prager's exceptional police work -- even if the woman herself couldn't make it... 
 Boss, good news -- as expected, all four suspects have been remanded in custody... 
 In addition, I'll be liaising with cross-border colleagues. 
 Early indications are this gang are responsible for numerous violent robberies across the South. 
 It's a result that's going to keep on giving... Well done. 
 Well done. 
 Right... On that note...

 Get off me. Oi. Oi, I haven't done anything wrong. 
 Let's see about that, shall we? 
 Control, this is Kilo Two Two Zero, we have four Ninja Turtles under arrest for theft. 
 Request another unit for transport, as soon as possible, please. 
 Why are we getting nicked? 
 Donatello was the only one doing it. You've checked me. I'm clean! 
 You work together, don't you? 
 Distraction. You dance, he dips. 
 Hey. All for one... and one for all. 
 Well done. 
 That's all right, isn't it? 
 And then put the little one... 
 That's Michelangelo, Sarge... 
 He's small, green and annoying. 
 I don't care what he's called, PC Vickers. 
 Sarge. 
 Put him in four. 
 Right, I'm going to need you to re-interview the shop worker from yesterday's ATM. 
 See if you can get any more details from her, all right? 
 Cheers, Anna, thanks. 
 ( He sighs ) 
 ( She chuckles ) : Oh, my goodness me. 
 Oh, I wondered when we'd see you. 
 Head. Guts. 
 And I swear my mouth feels like the inside of Madison's hamster cage. 
 Ah. 
 Oh, I don't want to see that. 
 ( He sighs ) 
 Just going to... sit here quietly until the room stops spinning. 
 All right. 
 DC Hawkins, you're with me. 
 Oh, boss, I think... 
 Eva Price. Vulnerable, juvenile, female MISPER, needs chasing up now. 
 Let's go. 
 ( He exhales ) 
 She's bright, in an academic sense, but... 
 She's had... 
 She HAS issues. 
 Er, anxiety... panic attacks, self-harm. 
 She has struggled for years and we try and help her, but... 
 How do you help someone who doesn't want to be helped? 
 And what does Eva do now? Is she still at school? 
 Just finished sixth form college and we're waiting for her A-level results. 
 When did you last see your daughter? 
 We had a family birthday two weeks ago. 
 She walked out and we haven't seen her since. 
 I mean, we know... 
 We understand she's not a child any more, but... even at 17... 
 She's still our little girl. 
 And you've no idea where she is now? 
 There's no other way to describe it. She's been brainwashed. 
 What do you mean? 
 The cafe owner where she works, he's a... charismatic, dangerous man. 
 Eva just seemed to spend more and more time with him, and she... fell under his spell. 
 She's run away with him to live on his houseboat. 
 And we just want her home. 
 Piers Trilby. 
 Boss? 
 The cafe owner. 
 I investigated a similar missing teenager case where he was involved. 
 Another waitress. 
 Any charges? 
 No. But there's a pattern. They're always vulnerable. 
 Mental-health markers. 
 They move out from the family home. Cut off all contact. 
 Stay with him until he moves on to the next one. 
 Right. Let's go visit this nonce on a boat. 
 Just looking for few moments of your time, that's all... 
 Of course, yeah. 
 So, er... we have some upset parents who are worried about their missing daughter. 
 We're just following up on their concerns... 
 Would either of you like a camomile tea? 
 Er, not for me. Boss...? 
 Camomile...? 
 No, thank you. 
 So, where is Eva now? 
 She went out for a walk. 
 Did she? Do you know where she went? 
 Er... I'm afraid not, no. 
 She likes to walk... 
 Watch the birds... 
 Look, I understand... 
 You've probably been sold a particular narrative by Eva's parents, but there really is nothing here for you to be concerned about. 
 I don't lure girls anywhere. 
 I PROVIDE them with a creative, elemental environment where I can support them in their learning... in the widest of senses. 
 But you can understand why people might think it's peculiar? 
 Middle-aged man with a queue of messed-up teenage girls? 
 Believe me, Eva is in every way my intellectual equal. 
 (sighing) : She was being stifled at home -- here, now, she's free. 
 Yeah, so that's why she ran away, is it? 
 Just so she could read books with you? 
 Does she cook for you? Clean the boat? 
 We share our domestic lives. 
 DC Hawkins! 
 ( Dramatic score ) 
 EVA! 
 EVA! 
 EVA! STOP! 
 Please... Please, leave me alone... 
 ( They pant ) 
 I'm not going to hurt you. 
 We just want to make sure you're all right... 
 Right. Come on. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This way. 
 Control, this is DI Kane. 
 I need a female officer to Beach Green to search and transport a prisoner soon as possible, please. 
 Don't let them do this, please. 
 Please don't let them take me... 
 I'm arresting you on suspicion of possession of a controlled drug. 
 You do not have to say anything. 
 But it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court. 
 ( She sniffles ) 
 Anything you say may be given in evidence. 
 Oh, come on, surely we don't need to arrest anyone. 
 It's just a bit of weed. 
 I'm taking Eva into custody to protect her as a vulnerable person. 
 My concern is to keep her safe. 
 And our driver, Duane... 
 A very nice man... 
 A VERY, very nice man... 
 And HE told us that we'd got to be back on the bus in an hour, so we thought... 
 Time for a quick one...! 
 ( Laughter ) 
 Yeah. Or three! 
 So, we had some pear cider... 
 It were gorgeous. 
 And now we don't know who we are or where we're going! 
 Luckily, we know where you're going, because Duane reported you missing... 
 Oh! 
 Oops, steady... 
 Oh, he's gorgeous, in't he? 
 Small, but firm.... 
 I think you're barking up the wrong tree there, Elsie... 
 Oh... Are you one of those? 
 How lovely! 
 They're everywhere in Brighton, aren't they? 
 Yeah. Not so many in Halifax, though, cos of the weather. 
 Oooh! There's Duane...! 
 Duane! 
 Duane. Duane, we got lost in the lanes! 
 Sorry, Duane, we got... We got... 
 ( Laughter ) 
 Come on, please. Mind your head... and your dress. 
 Where were you last night? 
 Missed a massive session. 
 Lino's bird did a brilliant Beyonce, didn't she? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Got us all free shots. 
 Single Ladies, my friend. Single Ladies. 
 Which is ironic, really. Cos she's not. 
 Not any more, anyway. 
 Will you please stop crying? 
 Right. Are we going, or what? 
 See you later. 
 See you later. 
 That guy's a creep. 
 He can wear hippie shirts, philosophise all you want... 
 He's still an abuser... 
 ( Phone chimes ) 
 Yeah? 
 No, I can't. 
 I can't come now. I've told you, I'm at work. 
 Boss? 
 ( He sighs ) 
 ( Tyres squeal ) 
 Boss, where we going? 
 ( Engine revs ) 
 Afternoon, Sarge. This is Eva, 17 years old. 
 She's been arrested on suspicion of being in possession of cannabis. 
 DI Kane and DC Hawkins witnessed her throwing this onto the ground. 
 17? 
 That case, I'm going to need to inform your parents that you've been arrested. 
 Would you like to speak to your mum and dad? 
 I'm not going home. I'll suffocate. 
 I'll take that as a "no", then. 
 Could scan this young lady please, PC Prager. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Can you put your arms out for me? Thank you. 
 ( Device beeps ) 
 Parents' number and address, there. 
 ( Device whines ) 
 Underwired bra? 
 OK, turn around for me. Your arms... 
 Thank you. 
 OK, clear, Sarge. 
 Put her in five, please, Donna. 
 Yeah, this way, Eva. 
 This is South Sussex Police, your daughter's been arrested on possession of drugs. 
 She'll need to be interviewed by police officers. Mm-hm. 
 Would one of you like to be the appropriate adult? 
 ( Door bangs ) 
 ( Keys jingle ) 
 I'll be five minutes. 
 What are we doing? Where are we? 
 Just stay in the car. 
 Come on, mate, what are you doing? 
 ( He sighs ) 
 ( Man shouting ) 
 I CAN'T BREATHE! 
 YOU'RE KILLING ME! 
 GET UP OFF THE FLOOR! 
 ( He wheezes ) 
 STOP DOING THIS TO ME! 
 STOP! I HATE YOU! 
 ( Door opens ) 
 ( He wheezes ) 
 ( He whimpers ) 
 Hey. Come here. Come here. 
 ( He sobs ) 
 It's all right, mate, it's all right, it's all right... 
 ( He sobs ) 
 Sh... It's OK. 
 Hey, sh, sh, sh... Sh.. 
 ( Door closes ) 
 ( He whimpers ) 
 ( Shouting from other cells ) 
 It's all right. 
 There we go. 
 This is a bit more comfortable, isn't it? 
 MEDIC! 
 ( Alarm blares ) 
 It's OK, Eva... It's all right. 
 Just let the nurse help you with those arms... 
 Can we call a paramedic in here, please, and I need a sharps tube, now! 
 It's OK. It's OK. 
 That was my father. 
 He had a stroke two months ago. 
 He has left-sided brain damage, aphasia... 
 ( He sighs ) 
 .. coordination problems. 
 I moved in with him to take care of him. 
 Well, what I saw didn't look like care to me. 
 He lashed out at the nurse, fell out of bed. 
 I was trying to get him back into bed, trying to help him... He attacked me. 
 Yeah. Then you lost it. 
 One of our prisoners concealed a weapon into her cell. 
 Harmed herself, but the paramedics have seen and treated her. 
 So, all under control, then? 
 Yes, sir. 
 It seems like a prisoner managed to smuggle a weapon into custody. 
 Mind you, I'm sure your PR department would manage to put a positive spin on that? 
 Right, where were we? 
 As I was saying, sir, obviously we're very restricted in what we can release before any potential court case. 
 However, the Chief Constable's very keen to issue a press release publicising the successful arrest of such a wanted gang... 
 We were lucky, rather than successful. 
 I'm sorry? 
 We were lucky that a single, resourceful police officer managed to throw her phone onto the back of a pick-up truck. 
 We were LUCKY that the gunman decided not to pull the trigger. 
 Otherwise, that would be a very different press release, wouldn't it? 
 One publicising the death of three police officers. 
 Sir, if we could just address the Chief's questions... 
 I'd like to address some questions of my own. 
 Why were the other units so far away? 
 Why are front-line police officers so thinly stretched? 
 Why are there never enough helicopters in the sky? 
 You know... I don't think I'm going to be able to help you with your good-news story, but I'll be certain to forward you a copy of the complaint about the lack of tactical resources that I WILL be sending to the Chief Constable. 
 OK? Thank you. 
 WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEARCHING THAT PRISONER? 
 Is this all we are now? Eva's appropriate adults? 
 Eva... the Mental Health Crisis Team are on their way. 
 And because of concerns about your mental health, you're going to be sectioned. 
 Taken to an appropriate in-patient facility. 
 Eva? 
 'So they'll keep Eva there?' 
 She won't be able to go back to the boat? 
 To that... awful man? 
 It's a safe, secure environment where Eva will get the support she needs. 
 That's what we've ever wanted for her. 
 [SHE SNIFFLES] It's the right kind of help... 
 Just can't believe this has happened to Eva... To our family. 
 We tried, we really did. 
 That's all you can do, you know. 
 Your daughter was vulnerable and someone took advantage of her. 
 She found herself in a relationship that she couldn't escape. 
 Abuse takes many forms. 
 Maybe it took this -- a crisis -- for you to get the help you needed? 
 Excuse me. 
 ( Door opens and closes ) 
 ( Door opens ) 
 You need to sort this out, boss. 
 Cos that situation, it's not good for your dad, and... 
 And it's definitely not good for you. 
 And as the officer responsible for searching the prisoner in custody... you're being suspended from duty, pending an investigation. 
 'You now need to leave the building immediately...' 
 (What's happened? What did he say?) 
 And you're not allowed to talk to anyone else involved. 
 ( She sniffles ) 
 Do you want a lift? 
 Lino's called me. He's asked me to take you home. 
 I'm all right, thanks. 
 Just do me a favour, then, yeah? Keep him happy. Come on. Get in. 
 Sorry about the mess. You know what it's like. 
 A badly-behaved macaw. 
 Here you are. 
 Look, I know it's none of my business, but... you might want to keep a bit of perspective. 
 Lino filled me in on everything and it sounds like a bloody nightmare. 
 But it's only work. 
 I messed up my first marriage... gorgeous, he was. 
 Looked like Colin Farrell -- don't tell Lino I told you that. 
 I got obsessed with the nine to five, ended up losing... the job and the bloke. 
 Just forget about this suspension nonsense. 
 It'll blow over. 
 Or it won't. 
 Either way, Donna, you'll be all right. 
 You're a survivor. 
 Did you just quote Beyonce? 
 Destiny's Child, actually. 
 They were shite. 
 Look. Go home. 
 See your missus... 
 You're going to be fine. 
 Well, yeah, it certainly matches our gang's MO. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Right, I'll be in touch when we get the DNA results back, but it's looking like more good news, though, right? 
 Excellent. All right. Cheers. Bye. 
 ( Phone rings ) 
 DS Moffat. 
 Yeah, well, I worked that DV. 
 It's, er, Stacey Shawcross. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Why? What's he done to her this time? 
 All right, I'll be right there. Thanks. 
 Debbie? 
 Hospital PA announcement : Please call X-ray on extension... 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 Apparently, the stress of the assault brought on early labour... 
 Jesus... 
 Apart from the obvious injuries... bruising, she's all right. 
 And as far as they can tell at this stage, the baby seems fine. 
 Could have been a lot worse. 
 So, where's Tyler? 
 Her toddler? 
 Mm. 
 Already in care. 
 And as soon as that one's out, we'll slap a care order on it. 
 There's no way Stacey's taking that baby home. 
 Not unless she can get rid of Reece. 
 Well, you can say that, but I can't. 
 I tell Stacey to press charges in order to get her kids back, his solicitor is going to have a field day in court. 
 ( Toy squeaks ) 
 OW! 
 ( Woman screams ) 
 Jesus! Sand... 
 Look! Look! Can you believe it? 
 I did one, then I thought I must've imagined it, so I did another one. 
 Three times -- same result. Aaaah! 
 Oh, my God. That is, erm... 
 I know. 
 I mean, I thought I might be, cos my boobs were agony, but then I thought it was cos I was about to come on, then I did the test this afternoon... 
 I can't believe this. 
 It's, it's unbelievable. 
 I know. 
 I didn't know whether to call you at work, or just wait... but we did it! 
 It's amazing. 
 Yeah! 
 Hey, come here. 
 Er... So, how, how, how many weeks are you? 
 Erm, about three... 
 Three? Right. OK. 
 What do you mean? 
 Eh? 
 Erm, "Right"? 
 No, no, no. I'm just trying to work out when it happened, that's all. 
 It's a bit of a surprise. 
 It can't be that much of a surprise, we've been trying for months. 
 No, I know, yeah. 
 Come here. Come here. Don't be silly. 
 Erm... 
 What? 
 This is what we wanted, isn't it? 
 Isn't it? 
 Oh... 
 I don't believe this. 
 It's not like it's even a big deal these days, you know. I didn't have to go to hospital or anything, it was just GP surgery. I just popped in and out. 
 That's not the point, Carl. 
 Isn't it? 
 No! 
 You had a vasectomy. 
 In secret. 
 Because you didn't want to have any more kids. 
 Yeah, but that was THEN. 
 And what about now? 
 Now? 
 Now, it's out of our hands, isn't it? 
 You know, that's the great thing about it. It's just fate, isn't it? 
 And babe, listen, we put all this behind us and we roll with it. 
 Ah... For what? 
 What, the next 18 years? 
 18 years with a kid that you don't really want and a wife that you're too frightened to tell the truth to? 
 Dad, why is there no hot water? 
 Bethany, please. 
 It's freezing. It's like Syria here, or something. 
 You know what, Bethany? Do you know who might have some hot water? 
 Your mum. 
 Dad! 
 Not now. 
 Yes, not now, Bethany. 
 OK, your dad and I are trying to have a conversation, a real conversation about something important. 
 About whether we have a future together. 
 Come on... 
 Why are you letting her talk to me like that? 
 Please, just go to your room. 
 Because this is my house and I will talk however I want. 
 And if you don't like it -- there's the door.

 As long as Reece is in your house, it isn't safe. 
 Listen, you'd better sort this out, cos I'm not going back inside! 
 Sorry, mate. 
 OI! 
 You're putting some violent scum before me? 
 Don't do this to me. 
 What have you done? 
 I've let you down. 
 Robert, I'm dealing with it! 
 HELLO? 
 It's OK, mate. 
 Don't move! 
 It's all right. I'm not moving, mate! 
 I'll do what you want.
