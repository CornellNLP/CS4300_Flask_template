 Previously on  Helix ... 
 So what are we looking for? 
 Fungal toxin that's ingested. Likely in the food supply. 
 Whatever this is, it's hot and it's on the move. 
 Honey. Tracked down a massive hive on the north wall. 
 Samples crawling with mycotoxin. 
 Are the bees carriers? 
 Take it. It is my legacy. 
 I'd say it's about time we took matters into our own hands. 
 Your actions threaten to destroy everything we've worked for. 
 Do not be consumed by the doubts and fears of a world we left behind. 
 You might have others fooled, but I know what you are. 
 What am I? 
 I think Alan suspects something. He keeps bringing up Ilaria. What is going on here? 
 Maybe you're the one who took Soren. 
 This is the suspect. Dr. Alan Farragut, former head of the CDC's special pathogens branch and field leader of the rapid response team. He led his team to the Arctic to investigate a deadly pathogen that... 
 NARVIK. I know. 
 Then you know that right after the Arctic BioSystems fiasco, Farragut dropped out of sight. 
 That's the last image that we have of him, exiting the headquarters of the Ilaria corporation moments before a bomb went off. A dozen people were killed. 
 Farragut is wanted by the French police, the FBI and Europol. 
 But he's our responsibility. We need your help to bring him in. 
 Why me? 
 Your background in toxicology and epidemiology make you uniquely qualified to join his former team. 
 Your job is to collect intel so we can make an arrest. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 (panting) 
 Stay with me, Sarah. OK? 
 Stay with me. Somebody help! Help us! 
 Somebody help! Help! 
 (coughing) 
 Oh my God, what happened? 
 I found her on the cannery floor. 
 She's losing a lot of blood. Help me get her up. 
 Can you stop the bleeding? 
 I can't even feel the bottom of the wound. 
 sh1t! We need a surgeon! 
 What happened to her? 
 Somebody attacked her. 
 You both need to leave. 
 Not leaving her with you. 
 She has a punctured lung and a lacerated pancreas. 
 Dr. Sommer and I are both qualified medical professionals. We'll handle it. 
 You're research doctors. 
 You're not a doctor at all! 
 I've sutured every wound on this island for the past 50 years, so unless one of you is a thoracic surgeon, you'll just be in my way. 
 I promise I'll take care of her. 
 There's nothing more you can do. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 This place is a nuthouse. We should grab Sarah and get the hell out. 
 Coast guards said they can't come back for another week. 
 Then use the damn sat phone, get us an airlift back to the mainland. 
 Kyle, we can't go anywhere until Sarah is stable. And if we run before we get containment, this outbreak could spread. 
 Fine, then we should tell these people about the honey before it turns the entire flock into a bunch of raving maniacs. 
 If we go wide with this, it could create a panic. 
 Are we on the same island? 
 I just got stoned by a bunch of kids! And someone just stabbed Sarah! We're so far past panic, it would take the light from panic 100 years to reach us. 
 OK. You're right. 
 I'll talk to Michael. 
 I'll tell him about the mycotoxin in the honey. 
 You go to the orchard, cordon off the infected hive. 
 We need to destroy it properly and then bioseal the remains. 
 If we do our jobs, we could still stop this thing. 
 Honey? 
 You're saying that this... disease and all the pain and suffering is caused by a few... infected bees? 
 More than a few. 
 And we don't know if the bees were the source. 
 They could've picked up the pathogen and carried it back to the hive. 
 Well, how are my people getting sick? 
 We don't eat honey or any food outside our walls. 
 We believe one of your followers may have harvested the honey and shared it with others. 
 Who? Who would do such a thing? 
 There's a man... 
 He's here undercover, pretending to follow your rules. 
 He's even using a false name. 
 Jerome. 
 Well, many of our followers come here trying to escape their past. We offer them a fresh start, no judgment. 
 Does that include terrorists? This man is a wanted criminal. 
 Our gates are open. We turn no one away. 
 Did you have any of these problems before Jerome arrived? 
 These problems began when  you  arrived. Doesn't make you a terrorist, does it? 
 I'm curious. Exactly how did you come by this information? 
 Jerome and I have a... history. 
 He's my brother. 
 Your brother? 
 I wasn't expecting that. 
 I felt I owed you an explanation. 
 So what do you suggest I do? 
 Keep him away from the rest of your people. Until you do, no one here is safe. 
 Thank you, Peter. 
 You've done me a great service. 
 And now I owe you. 
 (door opening and creaking) 
 (groaning) 
 Hello, Jerome. 
 Michael? 
 Where am I? 
 The French call it an oubliette. 
 The word literally means "to forget". 
 You wanna forget me? Why? 
 Have I done something to displease you? 
 It's time for you to confront your past, Jerome. 
 Your true past. For you to be honest about who you are and what you've done. 
 But my past is my own. You told us to leave it at the gate. 
 Don't tell it to me. 
 Talk to him. 
 Dr. Farragut seems to think you're dangerous. 
 He actually knows quite a bit about you. Well, he should... since he's your brother. 
 I really have no idea why he wanted me to confine you, but I mean, it's fairly obvious that you two have your issues. 
 Maybe you'll solve them. Maybe you'll kill each other. 
 I can't wait to find out which. 
 You gonna untie me? 
 Depends. 
 Wanna tell me why he threw you in here? 
 I was trying to do my job. To protect his people from the mycosis. 
 And that involved ratting me out? 
 (sighing) 
 I was trying to convince him to work with us. 
 You were the last chip I had to bargain with. 
 Right. 
 Michael and his people have been working against my team. 
 My team. 
 Not anymore. 
 You know, every time something goes wrong, I look up and there you are. 
 Arctic BioSystems, Paris, and now here. 
 Me? 
 You blew up a building, Alan! You murdered people! 
 I was trying to save Julia. 
 Ha! Well, you could've killed her. 
 Since when do you care? 
 Oh, that's right! Since you slept with her. 
 Oh, you selfish, self-centered prick! 
 I went up to the Arctic to get away from her, so you could have your life back! And what did I get? 
 NARVIK! I nearly lost everything, and yet somehow, you're the one who's suffered? 
 I lost Julia in the Arctic. 
 Don't kid yourself. She'd been trying to get away from you for years. 
 Not another word about her. 
 It's easy to threaten a man when he's tied up. 
 Now say something. 
 You threw your life away, Alan. 
 You're a murderer and a terrorist. 
 And you're a secondrate hack who's pretending to live my life because he couldn't make it on his own. 
 Do you have any idea what it's like to be the man who could never quite measure up? 
 Not my fault I was better at everything. 
 That's not what your wife said. 
 I would very much like to know what is going on in my orchard. 
 Is something happening? 
 Well, our friends in the CDC seem to have figured out how this terrible sickness is transmitted. 
 Through honey. 
 Michael, that's not possible. 
 We followed the safeguards, took every precaution... 
 And yet, there's a contaminated beehive where no hive should be. 
 If that's following precautions, I'd hate to see what out of control looks like. 
 We bred the pollen to be aseptic. 
 Even if the bees were cross-pollinating from outside the wall, this shouldn't be happening. Well, then how can you explain it? 
 Sometimes... nature finds a way. 
 Nature. Hm! 
 Do you know what this is? Cerbera odollam. 
 From Madagascar. They call it the Suicide Tree. 
 Its sap contains an alkaloid toxin which blocks the calcium channels in the heart. Just a single drop, the heart stops completely, and death... is nearly instantaneous. 
 (grunting) 
 If nature had its way, you'd already be dead. 
 But this plant is harmless, because I grafted the poison out of it. 
 On this island, nature does what I tell it to do. 
 Just like you. 
 Fix this. 
 (moaning in pain) 
 Being dead can't possibly hurt this much. Ah! 
 Stay still. 
 Something's not right. 
 You're not gonna die on me, are you? 
 I didn't think that was possible. 
 I'm already dying. 
 I know. 
 You told me. 
 TXM-7. I thought you were... 
 Immortal, not indestructible. 
 I don't age, I heal faster than you, but I can't grow a finger. I'm not Wolverine. 
 Who's Wolverine? 
 (laughing) 
 Ow! 
 Still. 
 It hurts to laugh. 
 Ah! 
 Ow! 
 Still. 
 You fought the haunted man. 
 The one that talks to ghosts. 
 His name was Hatake. 
 Was? Is he dead? 
 I don't know. 
 Why did you fight? 
 Is it about why you're here? 
 No. 
 Our fight was personal. 
 He was my father. 
 You killed your father? 
 We had issues. 
 (laughing) I have issues with my father too. 
 Different kind. 
 I never met him. 
 Yeah, well, maybe that's for the best. Ow! 
 (moaning softly) 
 Kyle? 
 Kyle... 
 You're awake. 
 Where is everybody? 
 They were very concerned about you. Especially Dr. Sommer. 
 How do you feel? 
 Like someone just stabbed me. 
 You barely had a pulse. 
 I've never seen someone recover so quickly after losing so much blood. 
 Yeah, I've always been a fast healer. 
 Ah! 
 You have a perforation in your lung and pancreas. 
 Lie back. 
 Was there any... permanent damage? 
 You'll have a pretty good scar, but your recovery is remarkable. 
 (sighing deeply) 
 Good genes, I guess. 
 Clearly. 
 Did you know about the honey? 
 I just found out from Michael. 
 I was coming to tell you. 
 Hm. 
 The way this works is when you hear things, you tell me immediately, so I don't get blindsided. 
 If I have to find things out on my own, what do I need you for? 
 I'm sorry. It won't happen again. 
 It's not the only thing that won't be happening again. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Hey! Hey, are you okay? Jesus. 
 Doesn't make sense. Symptoms are still presenting. You shouldn't be dead yet. 
 I'm not. I'm just the bait. 
 Come. 
 Michael, I wanted to apologize. 
 I should have checked the grounds for any rogue hives. 
 I believed the pollen was sterile, but obviously I was wrong. 
 I understand. 
 And I forgive you. 
 I know how difficult it is for you to see the scope of what we're doing here, but that's why I need the three of you. 
 We cannot allow things to fall through the cracks. 
 I know. 
 It won't happen again. 
 Oh, Anne... 
 So strong. And smart. 
 Clearheaded. 
 A good leader. 
 It's a shame what the years have done to you. 
 I suppose it can't be helped. 
 Perhaps one day we'll be able to hold back the ravages of time, but... 
 Until then... 
 Until then. 
 I think you knocked a filling loose. 
 Serves you right. 
 Same one you knocked out in high school. 
 You deserve it that time too. 
 I don't think that was a fair fight. I was hungover. 
 That your excuse for losing? 
 You always did have a great left hook. 
 Just like the old man. 
 I'm nothing like Dad. 
 Sorry. 
 Used to be you and me against that b*st*rd. 
 Now look at us. I don't know what happened. 
 We grew up. 
 You think we'll ever figure this out? 
 What's to figure? 
 Michael threw us down here so we could beat the hell out of each other. 
 No. 
 No, I think he put us down here to see if we'd figure a way out. 
 (scoffing) It's a fricking dungeon, Alan. 
 No, look. 
 I put you on my shoulders, you can reach that grate. 
 Who knows if it's locked? If not, you can pull me up after. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 Okay, hoist me up and... 
 What? 
 Come on. 
 Oh, I get it. You don't trust me. 
 You did just try to knock out my teeth. 
 That means I'm gonna leave you down here? No matter what our differences are, we're family. 
 I would never do that to you. 
 I wanna believe you, but with all we've been through lately... 
 Okay, I'll boost you and then you pull me up after, okay? 
 You'd do that? 
 Yeah, like I said, we're family. 
 Come on. 
 No signs of infection or sepsis. Your swelling is already going down. 
 Great. 
 That means I'll be out of here soon. 
 You shouldn't be so eager. 
 That recklessness is what got you in trouble in the first place. 
 See, in the real world, there's this new thing where we don't actually blame the victims. 
 A woman in your condition shouldn't be going anywhere near infectious diseases. 
 What do you mean, in my condition? 
 You need to take better care of yourself... and your baby. 
 Uh, no. 
 No, I'm not pregnant. 
 I've delivered nearly a hundred little ones. 
 I think I know when a woman is with child. 
 Is it okay if this just stays between us? 
 Of course. You haven't told the father yet. 
 Is it Dr. Sommer? 
 Kyle? No. 
 No. 
 He seems to care a great deal for you. 
 No, Kyle and I are just colleagues. 
 As for the father, he... He and I aren't close anymore. 
 Perhaps it's just as well. The better to protect your legacy. 
 My legacy? 
 Children are the only thing that last. Nothing else matters. 
 I've cared for hundreds of people on this island. Saved many lives. 
 But when I'm gone, I'll be nothing more than a picture on a wall. 
 But through our children, we live forever. 
 Trust me... There's more to life than living forever. 
 
 
 
 What is this stuff? 
 Smells like my grandma's condo is St. Pete. 
 Lavender oil. 
 It's a natural antidote for bruising. Yeah. I'm sure I'll be fine. 
 This island... can be dangerous. 
 You think this is a game? 
 There were six members of that crew. We've only found four. 
 That means there's two homicidal mycotics loose on the island. 
 Maybe more if anyone else ate more of that honey. 
 This pathogen is spreading and you're acting like a naughty schoolgirl with her first crush. 
 I didn't know you liked to play rough. 
 I can play rough too. 
 Where'd you learn to cook? 
 My mother. 
 She said a good meal nourishes the soul. 
 Smart woman. 
 Yeah, she had to be. 
 Did you ever try to find your father? 
 There's nothing to find. 
 He died in the NARVIK outbreak when I was young. 
 I remember. That was nearly... thirty years ago. 
 That's why my mother brought me here. 
 The riots. The outbreaks. She said that the world was no longer a fit place to raise a child. 
 Like I said, smart woman. 
 And it's only gotten worse. 
 Maybe you'll find a cure. 
 (laughing) Not at this rate. 
 By the time I get back, there may not be much of a world left. 
 I hear there's not much left anyway. 
 I wouldn't have risked my life for nothing. 
 I'm trying to save all the remaining immortals before it's too late. 
 Funny. 
 What's that? 
 All it took was a little mortality to make you people human again. 
 You should be sleeping. But you're awake. 
 Alert. 
 I've been in bed all day. I need to move around. 
 Slow down, you're not ready yet. 
 I'll be fine. 
 I really need to get back to the lab and check on my team. 
 At least let me get you cleaned up. You've still got blood on your face. 
 Just another moment. 
 No... 
 It can't be. 
 Landry. To what do I owe the pleasure? 
 Amy thought you might need this. 
 Right. She probably just wanted you to check up on me. 
 What does that mean? 
 You know, make sure I wasn't... 
 Wasn't what? 
 Making any mistakes. With my work. 
 She's been very concerned about our progress. 
 Amy is the best thing that ever happened to this island. 
 She's, uh... she's a special girl. 
 And lucky to have somebody like you looking after her. 
 Now if you don't mind, I need to get back to my work. 
 Agnes! Agnes, where have you been? We need your help. 
 I've been taking care of my patient. 
 We have a problem. 
 The sickness, it's... in the bees. 
 The honey's infected, we have to do something. 
 Find Anne. 
 Deal with it. 
 Did you hear what I said? 
 We have bigger concerns than a few bees. The CDC doctor is a silver eye. 
 No, that's not possible. 
 You're right, Amy. It's not. 
 (grunting) Okay. 
 Bring me forward. 
 Come on, hurry up! The human spine is not designed to carry this much weight on the same back! 
 Almost... 
 I got it! 
 Help me get wedged in here. 
 (grunting) 
 (grunting) Come on! 
 Oh, God! 
 You know, the only reason I'm in this mess... is I tried to save you in the Arctic. 
 Wha... what are you talking about? 
 Just get me out of this hole. 
 Spent most of my life trying to save you from yourself. 
 But it is way too late. 
 Alan, we had a deal. 
 I boost you up, you'd have never come back for me. 
 No, no, no, come on! That's not true, I'd never do that to you! You're my brother! 
 You're no brother. 
 The shortcuts, the backroom deals, the lies? 
 You know who that sounds like? 
 You b*st*rd. 
 Our father. 
 Come on, just get me out of this hole! 
 You ready to tell the truth? 
 About what? 
 NARVIK, in Porto Rico? 
 An adolescent psychopath, the Scythe, escaping in the Arctic? The mistakes in Paris? 
 How long have you been working for Ilaria? 
 What? That's ridiculous! 
 I heard you, Peter. You called them from the roof. 
 You always took the easy way out, never wanted to work for anything. 
 What did they offer you? Money? A seat on the board? 
 Jesus. You didn't get that much from them, did you? 
 You sold your soul, you disloyal son of a bitch. And for nothing. 
 Hey. Hey, you don't know what you're talking about, okay? 
 Just get me out of this hole. 
 You dug this hole yourself. It's where you belong. 
 No, no, no, no! Alan! Alan, don't leave me here! Alan! 
 (gasping) 
 I just wanted to check your temperature. 
 Am I okay? 
 You're fine. 
 Better than that. 
 You almost look as healthy as you did when you landed. 
 You mean right before you clubbed me? 
 I already apologized for that. 
 No you didn't. 
 But I forgive you. 
 What about your father? 
 Did you think about forgiving him? 
 That wasn't really an option. 
 But I think in the end the sword was some sort of apology. 
 He called it his legacy. 
 May I? 
 Do you know what it says? 
 My father never taught me how to read Japanese. 
 His last gift... I have no idea what it means. 
 You get some sleep. 
 Here's the last of the honey, just like you asked. I gave the rest to your... 
 CDC friend. 
 He's not my friend. 
 You are. 
 And you did a very good job. 
 This jar... is going to get me off this island. 
 And you, Landry... 
 You got it for me. 
 Caleb? 
 Oh no! No! 
 No, no, no! 
 Caleb! 
 Caleb! 
 Ow! Dammit! 
 You don't look very comfortable with that equipment. 
 Long day. 
 Do you need something? 
 I'm looking for Dr. Jordan, have you seen her? 
 She's... taking samples. 
 This late at night? 
 You know Hot Zone. 
 All business all the time. She doesn't really have an off switch, does she? 
 Yeah. If you see her before I do, tell her I need to talk to her. It's important. 
 Wait. You can't go. 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, Dr. Jordan said you might help us. 
 Not before I talk to her. 
 Well, then settle something for me. Arctic BioSystems. 
 What? 
 There are rumors. 
 Well, she was there, so you can ask her. 
 What about Paris? 
 Was she there too? 
 I figure I oughta know who I'm working with. 
 Sarah help you blow up that building? 
 Who are you? 
 What are you really doing here? 
 I'm investigating a pathogen. 
 How about you? 
 Who do you work for? Tell me! 
 You work for Ilaria, don't you? 
 Tell me! Who do you work for? 
 You're making a huge mistake, Dr. Sommer. 
 (Music playing) 
 I don't know how we reached this point. 
 Illness, disobedience... contempt for our rules... 
 I'm failing my people. 
 There's some good news. 
 The CDC doctor's recovering. 
 You said she was going to make it. 
 She shouldn't have. I'd say it's a miracle if I believed in that sort of thing, but you and I both know better. 
 Do we? 
 She's not the first person I've seen who heals like that. 
 I'd say she's just like you. 
 There's no one like me. 
 You lied to us. 
 Oh, Agnes. Of course I didn't. 
 You told us you were the only one. 
 That there were no others. 
 But I saw her eyes. 
 Silver, like yours. 
 That's impossible. She wasn't there. 
 Wasn't where? 
 (sighing) 
 You've always known there were others, haven't you? 
 Oh, Agnes... 
 Please, tell me the truth. 
 Are there other immortals? 
 Have you been keeping this from us? 
 Could you have made me like you? 
 Agnes... 
 You know I love you. 
 More than every face on that wall. 
 Ever since you were... a small child, you were different. 
 You're smarter, you're more self-possessed, more driven. 
 Of all my daughters, you've always been my favorite. 
 But this lack of trust, this doubt, it's... it's like a virus. 
 And we will lose everything we've worked for, everything I've built for the past five hundred years. 
 I just wanna be with you forever. 
 Oh, I know.
