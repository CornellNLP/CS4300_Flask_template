♪ I've got lots of friends in San Jose ♪ (Low growling) (Man coughing) What is that? Progress. (Rumbling and growling) Presentation starts in five minutes. I can't find it. Did you look under the desk? Why would it be under the desk? That's where I found your Seaborg medal. How hard can it be to find a 160-year-old pump handle? Depends. On what? On who's doing the finding. Where did you... Where you left it. You're a lifesaver. So I've been told. In 1854, London experienced a terrible cholera outbreak. Local doctors attributed the epidemic to miasma, or bad air and they responded to it by burning incenses and promoting the sale of fragrant flowers. (General laughter) Not, as you might imagine, terribly helpful to the 600 or so who died of the disease. But a doctor and a clergyman mapped out the victims, and this was the very first epidemiological study. What they found... was a cluster of cases around Broad Street, where there was a city water pump. Defying the local authorities, they did the unthinkable. They took off the handle. (General laughter) And the outbreak came to an end, but the lesson lives on. And so, unfortunately, does cholera. (Startled reactions) When a surgeon fumbles, a patient dies. When we drop the ball, thousands die. As new CDC field officers, you are about to embark on a mission to the far corners of the earth. And you will witness horrors others cannot imagine. Horrors that make cholera seem tame. You will make sacrifices that others find unthinkable. And your family and your friends will sacrifice right along with you. And you will do all of this... because you cannot fathom living any other life. This is no game. The stakes... are very real. That's just scotch in there, by the way, single malt. In fact, toss it back. (General laughter) Good luck to you all. Late last night,  a military listening post received a distress call from a private research base owned by Arctic Biosystems. Big pharma. Just read about them. The call denoted a possible retroviral outbreak. Two people dead that we know of, and a third person already infected. I'm sorry, who are you again? Major Sergio Balleseros, USAMRIID by way of the Army Corps of Engineers. I've been ordered to escort you and your rapid response team, including Dr. Walker, up to the base to determine whether it is in fact a retrovirus. Now, given that the army fielded the distress call, we're gonna share jurisdiction with the CDC. It looks like there's no jurisdiction at all. If the base is above the 83rd parallel, it's international territory. We have no authority there. Arctic Biosystems is granting us access, for now. How kind of them. This is all fine, but why me? There are six other senior scientists at the CDC who can run point on this, including Dr. Walker. The distress call specifically asked for Dr. Walker. She thought it best that we include you. I'm... I'm still not following. The third infected patient is Peter. Who's Peter? My brother. (Wind blowing) Our primary goal  is to identify this pathogen. Sarah. You'll be with me and Peter on the deceased to establish the extent of the illness. Julia will determine the cause of the illness. Doreen, I need you to swab every inch of Peter's lab, test every animal for the source of the illness. How about you, GI Joe? What is it that you do exactly? I'm a systems engineer. I'll be analyzing the base infrastructure. Air, water, waste treatment Looking for ways the virus might have spread through pipes or air vents. So, you're a glorified plumber. Only if you're a glorified veterinarian. Look, we have no idea what this thing is, so we treat it like a hot agent. BSL-4 protocol, full suits, and decontamination showers for every potential exposure. That could eat up a lot of time. Well, better safe than sorry. Says the man who spent the night in a thatched hut full of Ebola victims. That's his ex-wife? Yep. Not what I expected. She's smarter than you. Doubtful. Better in the lab too. Highly doubtful. He never talks about her or his brother. That's probably because he caught her and his brother in bed together. Don't worry, they're professionals. They'll make it work. Why would I be worried? 'Cause I see the way you look at him. This is gonna be the most frakked-up family reunion ever. Raptor 47 to Artic Biosystems, come in. We read you, Raptor 47, loud and clear. We're making our final approach. We clear for landing? Daniel Aerov, Head of Security. Sorry we don't have the red carpet waiting, but we're not used to visitors. We're not used to red carpets. This is Dr. Hiroshi Hatake, Director of Research. Alan Farragut, CDC. Peter's brother. Of course. We've come a long way for Peter. When can we see him? He's been transferred to our isolation facility. I'm afraid the news isn't good. He's been in and out of consciousness for the last eight hours. And the rest of your people? Are you implementing hard or soft quarantine? Neither. You haven't locked down the base? Allow me to explain... You have three victims of an unknown pathogen. And only three, who all worked in the same lab. There have been no other infections. Since we are not seeing a base-wide outbreak, we are fairly certain it's not airborne. Well, at least you're fairly certain. Hey, that's our ride. They can't stay here. The temperature can drop to -70; it turns jet fuel to jelly. Plus, we can't risk leaving before we have full containment; CDC protocol. You just made me feel better, knowing they're out there. Not to worry. Camp Eisenhower is only 200 miles away. They can be back here in no time. Please stick out your left hand. RFID marker injected under the skin. We all have them. Yours will give you unrestricted access to the base. (Alert tone) Main elevator security access granted. Level B. Sweet Mother Mary Matthew. How many people work here? A hundred six scientists from 35 countries; 15 support staff. That's a lot of potential patients. Let's focus on what we know. I'll need to see the personnel records of the infected, their professional and medical histories. I'll need to see their living quarters and any other areas they frequented. And I want access to their lab animals and research materials. And I'll need to start tracking down anyone they've been in contact with for the past... 48 hours. Understood. Level E. Now I want to see my brother. Level F. I haven't talked to Peter in a long time. How long? That night? I went home and packed a bag; caught the next flight to La Paz. Ah, you always did have issues with impulse control. I'm worried. That's all right. We're here, we'll do what we can for him. He's not the one I'm worried about. (Device beeping steadily) His vitals are all over the place. He... probably won't make it through the night. Peter. I'm going to ask you some questions. If you can't speak, try to nod yes or no. Do you have a T1 link here? No. That's too bad. It's gonna take forever to upload this data back to Atlanta. We don't have a T1 because it's obsolete. It's a synchronous optical network, 10 gigs a second. It has to be fast, 'cause we only get the satellite an hour each day. You seem to know a lot about medicine and technology for a head of security Dr. Hatake taught me everything I know. Where did you two meet? An orphanage. In Barrow. He adopted me. I've been with him as long as I can remember. Peter, it's me, Alan. Dr. Farragut, do you know where you are? Do you know what happened to you? Yes. The white room. Peter. Peter. Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes. Can you do that? Look into my... That's it. Peter, it's me. It's Alan. Alan, the blood. It's black. (Peter grunting) (Alarm beeping) I need a security team to quarantine now! You lie! You all lie! Everyone lies! Everyone! Everyone lies! (Alarm stops) (Alan panting) (Device beeping steadily) (Julia panting) How long had Peter been assigned to this lab? The last six months. Working on...? I'm afraid that's over my pay grade. You'd have to ask Dr. Hatake. You expect us to help you, but you won't tell us what you're working on? We check that weekly. Good for you. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Aren't you a big girl. Or boy. They have no s*x organs. We've designed a way to inhibit the signaling pathway responsible for genitalia. Makes control easier. Got an ex-husband I wouldn't mind trying that on. Where are the monkeys? We don't have any monkeys. You're kidding, right? With the kind of work you're doing here? No monkeys means no monkeys. These are the other two victims that were found with Peter. You ready? Yeah. Open the bag. What the hell? (Retching) (Door opening) (Door pneumatics hissing) That won't happen again; you have my word. No, Sarah, it's OK. I've been around some nasty hot agents, but I've never seen anything like that. No one has seen anything like this. You still thinking retrovirus? Looks more like some kind of hemorrhagic fever. Blood loss is consistent with Ebola or Marburg, but... this kind of tissue degradation... This thing doesn't kill, it annihilates. So how was Peter still alive? First things first. Where's Doreen? With Major Balleseros, swabbing down Peter's lab. Good. Get started on the assays, Sarah. I need to see this thing to beat it. Yeah, I'm on it. Jules, talk to Hatake. Find out what our victims were working on. We need to find the causation of this. You should be in there with Peter. Whatever time he's got left... No, he wouldn't want me sitting around watching him die. What are you gonna do? (Squeaking) Yep, just as I thought. Hey, what are you doing? These lives rats in the PRC test confirm conclusively that Hatake's right. It isn't airborne. That's good news. Yep, except I'm no closer to the source, and I still have no idea on the mode of transmission. I hate rats. I don't. My dad was a master sergeant. Moved us around a lot. Rats are easy to travel. You do this a lot in the service? Take apart drains and toilets looking for viruses? I spent my first tour in Iraq, searching for WMDs. See any action? Rarely left the base. Sounds dangerous. Bet you got some pretty nasty paper cuts. The last few years I spent harassing the cartels in South America. Must have been shaking in their boots. Ever actually fire a gun? Not since boot camp. Hey, let me see that. What is it? M. mulatta. Unless I miss my guess, this is from a rhesus macaque. So, they have monkeys. What's the big deal? That they lied about it. Monkeys are one of the main agents of zoonotic transfer that's passing a virus from animal to human or vice versa. So, what didn't they want us to find out? Dr. Hatake? Dr. Hatake? (She exhales.) Unbelievable. The Arctic has a timeless quality. Don't you agree? Makes it a little tough on the commute, though. (He chuckles.) We get more accomplished without the distraction of the outside world. Like interference from regulatory agencies? I need to know everything about Peter's last few days. What he was working on, who he was working with... I thought you might. What's all this? Peter's research. There are 20 more boxes in his lab. That's gonna take me days to sort through. Can you at least tell me what he was working on? Mutagens, mostly. For speeding up mutations. Those are dangerous. You wouldn't want to let your children play with them. Do you have children? No, I don't. Can you think of any correlation between his research and the infectious agent? No. I'm sorry. System voice :  Shift one, report. Shift one, report. Shift one, report. Alan, tissues samples are... Uh, I didn't mean to interrupt. No, it's OK. Entry 224. Got in some UV therapy this morning. Ran three miles on the treadmill. It's getting harder to tell day from night, but I guess that doesn't matter. I'm still seeing T. She is... terrific. But I'm starting to wonder whether I'm truly meant for relationships. And it's not that I'm bad at them. It's more like... well, they're bad for me. More than anything, I am excited  about being up here. I... I understand certain things now. ...up here. I... I understand certain things now. What is it? Look at his hand. We used to do that nights when our father came home drunk or angry, which was most nights. What does it mean? Run like hell. You need to come to isolation now. Contamination. Contamination. Contamination. Contamination. Contamination. Contamination. Contamination. Contamination. How did you leave him in there with the bone saw? I was a little busy trying... Too busy to follow BSL-4 safety protocol? You're both missing the point here. How did he get out? This morning he was terminally ill. Now he's ripping out of restraints? We sealed off the entire floor. Deactivated Peter's RFID chip. He's trapped. But we still need to get him out of there. We're gonna flood the ducts with halothane gas. It'll knock him out for four hours. Once the gas clears we'll retrieve his... Look, Peter is our best chance to understand how this pathogen works. He may have antibodies which have allowed him to fend off the infection. We need him alive. I'm sorry, but I have the lives of 120 others to consider. No one is safe from the virus until we have contained here. Security teams confirm level lockdown.[i] Once the gas clears I'll take a security team and we'll bring him back to isolation. (Gas hissing) (Mechanics locking in) If you're going up there, I'm going too. I can't allow that. It's too dangerous. If there's any chance Peter's alive, I need to be up there. As you wish. Listen, we've been at this for over an hour, and still no monkeys. If Hatake is granting us unrestricted access to the base, why don't we just confront him, tell him we found a monkey hair? Yeah, right. I doubt we'd get a straight answer. Besides, this is way more fun. [i]Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. So much for unrestricted access. You got any bright ideas? Liquid nitrogen. Freezing rearranges the tensile strength. (Beeping) (Unlocking) Huh. Northwest A, clear. Section northwest B, clear. Southwest B, we're clear. Daniel : Dr. Farragut, we need you to check in. Dr. Farragut. Are you sure my brother's up here? We sealed the vents in this sector, and that concentration of gas should have knocked him out. (Breathing with respirator) Jeez. What the hell happened here? What's that smell? That is monkey. The only creatures that smell worse are humans. There must have been a hundred of them. Where the hell did they all go? I don't know, but someone busted off this cage door. From the inside. I've got something here. Uh... black mucus. Uh, Southwest... uh... Yeah, Southwest C. He was definitely here. (Crash) (Monkey screeching) What was that? Peter? Peter! (Monkey chattering) (Monkey chattering) (Clattering) He's smart. Way too smart. (Low boom) (Snarling nearby) There you are, handsome boy. Come on out. Peter! Come on. (Monkey screeching) (Doreen screaming) He's here! Peter's here! Wait for backup! (Heavy blow struck) Are you okay? Am I cut? Do you see any breaks on the skin. I don't think so. Be sure. It's important. You're okay. (Sigh of relief) He's here. Peter's here. It's not him. It's... it's not Peter. Oh, my god. He was on one of my security teams. Joseph Kneizeh, 31 years old, Talkeetna, Alaska. He was attacked and dismembered. This doesn't make sense. The question we should be asking is  why? Why did Peter attack this man? Why cut off his hand? And why is the pathogen making him stronger? I want to seal off this part of the base. All nonessential personnel, keep them in dedicated safe rooms. Nobody travels unless they travel with a partner, at least until we can recapture Peter. Attention, Code 830, Level G, Oncology. Anything from the first set of cultures? Cells are heavily damaged, most totally deformed. It's like... Armageddon down there. But no sign of a virus? I screened for all current viral structures. Filaments, polygons, cylinders, spheres... even icosahedrons. What if it's not current? A couple of MIT scientists discovered evidence of ancient viruses in the Greenland ice cores. They found these obsolete structures dating back 140,000 years. I gotta hand it to Alan. He's got an eye for the smart ones. It's not like that. Not like what? Alan is a great mentor, but there's nothing going on. I would have said the exact same thing. Only that was eight years ago. Look at that. What? What is it? Right there. That's only 15nm. There's no virus that small. No current virus. I need you to finish this. Where are you going? To find Alan. He needs to see this now. (Device beeping rapidly) (Signal noise) started checking for paleoneurological structures. It's some form of spherical capsid, but unlike anything we've ever seen before. It's not naturally occurring, at least not in this century. Here it is blown up to 100,000 XP. Here's 500,000. How was your walk in the snow? Fine, thanks. A bit colder here than you're used to. Doesn't bother me. I'm adaptable. You know what they say about those who fail to adapt. The delivery will be on schedule. The schedule changed when the CDC showed up. I had nothing to do with that. Either way, the people you and I work for aren't happy, and now I have to clean up your mess. Alan :  Oh, what the hell is that? Sarah :  Wait, there's more. My god. We thought it was just replicating, but there's something else. This mutation only occurs in a fraction of the samples. It's minimal but it's statistically relevant. Which could explain why Peter is still alive and the others died. But what's it doing to him? Julia : For lack of a better term, it's... changing him. Into what?

(Alarm) He held me down, put his mouth over mine, like some kind of animal. (Chattering) I've never felt so violated. (Screams) I was choking. I couldn't bloody breathe. Like he was trying to smother me. What about the others? What others? There were three more in here with us. After the attack... they ran. Where? I don't know. I need their names. We have a containment issue. I heard. I've asked Hatake for a security team. We're mounting a search. This place is huge. If we can't maintain a simple isolation protocol... There's nothing simple about this. All right, let's concentrate on what we do know. We know the virus is not airborne. What are the victims saying? They're saying that Peter engaged in some kind of oral contact. What, like a kiss or a bite? More like an assault. The R-naught of the virus is now six. Multiply that times our escapees... That's 18 new cases we can look forward to. We're not even sure Peter's done yet. Jules, I need you to get started on the rats right away. We need to find out the rate of infection. Sarah, can you handle the isolation unit until Doreen checks in? Yeah, absolutely. If you see any signs of acute viral syndrome... Fever, sweats, rash, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy... Any of that. You get back into a Racal suit and you find me immediately. Dr. Farragut. Our three missing doctors, Tracey, Raver, and DeKlerk. No one has seen them since they fled the sunroom. Why does that not surprise me? Can you tell me, then, if anyone's tried to leave the base in the last eight hours? No. Well, then we'll have to do this the old-fashioned way. Major Balleseros and myself will go floor to floor, room by room. And if they refuse to cooperate? Like your brother? Let's not forget he's still out there. I'll have to persuade them. I hope you can. But just in case, our security teams will carry stun batons and restraints. You're going to try to win them over with force? The safety of this base is my only concern. All right, I don't agree with restraining people any more than you do, but let's just find them first, see if we can convince them to do what's best for the whole base. You're gonna need my help with those escaped patients. Not as much as I need you in the lab. Rate of infection is secondary to containment. You know that. I've been tracking infected patients for the past two years. I know how to talk to them. This is not about your qualifications. Then what is it about? Our lack of resources up here. That's bullshit. When was the last time you even left Atlanta? Damn it, Jules, we cannot both be in charge. You'll have to follow my lead on this. (Beep) (Happy instrumental music) (Squeaking) (Rats squeaking) (Quiet static sound) How long do we have to be in here? A couple of weeks at most. A couple of weeks? What about my research? What if I'm not infected? I'm in the same room with them. We're breathing the same air... Shut up, Bryce. Everybody, please calm down. I know this is very stressful. You don't know anything. How old are you? I'm twenty-six. You look like you're 15. I have two master's and a PhD from MIT specializing in virology and biogenetics. I was the youngest doctor hired by the CDC in over a decade, and Dr. Farragut put me in charge of isolation because I'm qualified. Now, I will do my best to address your needs, but I want to make one thing perfectly clear: we will have order here. We'll start with Dr. Tracey's room. I'll breach the door and enter first. Don't follow until you hear the all-clear. What's that? Stun baton. Use 'em on polar bears. Non-lethal, but they pack a wallop. Ought to come in handy if we run into any bears. If we run into Peter Farragut, you'll be glad we have these. He tore off a man's head. You think a shock is gonna stop him? You got a better idea? Yeah, I do. No breaching, no batons. We knock on the door. If Dr. Tracey's home, we have a conversation. And if she's in no mood to converse? I've grown kind of fond of my hands. (Wind blowing) Dr. Tracey? Dr. Tracey, it's Alan Farragut with the CDC. These are from the sunroom. She was here. But she didn't want to be. She was trying to get out. Then where the hell did she go? (Happy instrumental music) Who are you? D-Doreen Boyle. How do I know that's your real name? I-It's on my driver's license. I got my real weight on there too, but I'm not telling you that. Who sent you here? I work for the CDC. I study infectious diseases. Maybe you can help me... Don't you come near us! You hear me? Us? Who are you talking to? You're messing with my head. I'm not gonna hurt you. to take you to isolation... No, no, no! Not there. They do terrible things to you. No, I can't tell you. They'll take me to the White Room like Dr. Hvit. I want off this base! You get me on the helicopter. You promise me? I'll even get you to sit shotgun. Come on, I'll go with you... Why... Why would you lie to us? There is no helicopter here. No, not now, but I can make a call. You are a dirty, filthy liar. Now, what are we gonna do with you? Are you all right? Yeah. I thought I heard something. I keep thinking about Peter up there. It's just the base settling. Have you slept since you arrived? Uh, an hour or two. (She sniffles.) I'm fine, really. Sleep in the Arctic is critical. The mind can play tricks. I'll take that under advisement. Wait. What just happened? (Rats squeaking) Did you see that? Yes. What was going on in that lab? I told you. Peter was researching mutagens. I think we both know that was no mutagen. What was he really working on? (Labored breathing) You've got to let us out of here. This is kidnapping. I demand to talk to a lawyer! This is a public health crisis. The CDC has full jurisdiction. Oh! A hell of a lot of good that's done! We could do a better job of finding a cure ourselves. Give it a rest, Bryce. You give it a rest! You're not the one who shared a bathroom with Typhoid Mary over there. I'm sorry. Try to keep still. Or what? I'll get sick and die? (Chuckles) Must be bad you put the suit back on. We don't know exactly what we're dealing with. Everything could be fine. Not knowing is why things can't be fine. Not knowing is why those two over there are gonna turn on me. It's just a matter of time. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. That's a promise you don't want to make. (Gasping in pain) Do you have morphine sulfate here? He needs morphine now. Where do I get it? Level G, drug stockroom. (Loud shout) Get up! Who is it? One of the runners from the sunroom. He was hiding in the stairwell. That's Dr. DeKlerk from the aerosol division. You didn't have to be so rough with him. Maybe if you people followed directions. Maybe if you told us what the hell was going on. (DeKlerk coughing) What's wrong with him? Is he infected? Uh, we don't know. What's his name? I told you. DeKlerk. His first name! Uh, Henrik, I think. Henrik, we're with you. We're with you. We'll take care of you. He's still breathing. Get him to sickbay. Show's over. Everyone go back to your rooms. Not until you tell us why we haven't been evacuated. Keep him away from me. You didn't answer my question. We're doing the best we can. That's bullshit. You're from the CDC. You could get us out of here if you really wanted to. You know what? You're right. You're right. We could evacuate you all, airlift you out to the nearest hospital, and you know what would happen then? It would start with the doctors and the nurses. The ones caring for you. They'd go home to their families, kiss their kids goodnight, and pass on the virus. And the next day at school, some of those kids would infect others, and in two weeks' time, this virus... is in the general population. In four weeks, every major city on this planet. So, no, we're not evacuating you. But we're not abandoning you. We will stay with you as long as it takes to figure this out. Now, please, just go back to your rooms. Nice speech. I haven't heard that since... Kikwit, '95? It was Joburg, '96. What are you doing here? There was something strange going on in Peter's lab. I've been combing surveillance tape... I asked you to work on rate of infection. This seemed more important. I thought I made this clear... What's going on, Alan? You were always stubborn, but at least you made sense. We talked about this... Is this about Peter? That's absurd. Are you punishing me? Because believe me, I've punished myself enough for both of us. This is not the time, it's not the place... It was never the time or the place! That was the problem to begin with. Jules. Ah! You're here for... What? You're here for a reason! Um... yeah, I'm, uh, I'm with the CDC. We're here to help you. No! Not you. Walker. Got something here. Injection logs for the last three months. Here's the date that matches the surveillance tape. February 19th. Lot 14. He injected 0.2ccs of NARVIK-A. Lot 15, 0.2ccs of NARVIK-B. What is that? I encourage my staff to push the envelope, to try new and untested formulas. Was Peter experimenting with this? Not that I was aware of. Who else worked in this lab with him? You met both of them yesterday. In body bags. We need to replicate the test. Peter's research. We can examine the results ourselves. Inject more rats? And see what happens. I should've known. They were never gonna use it for something good. Move a few genes here and there, activate the replication cycle. Bingo, you got yourself the perfect weapon. it wasn't my fault, right? How was I supposed to know it was gonna go sideways? You can't make a virus and expect it to follow instructions, right? Don't play dumb! You're not fooling anyone. You knew what you were doing this whole time. I am not taking the fall for this alone, you hear me?! (Tracey roaring furiously) Ah! Oh, God! I'm sorry. What's wrong with me? Sarah! Are you all right? Not really. Did he... touch you? Make any kind of contact? Did he get any secretions on you? No, I'm... I'm OK. He didn't attack me. A lot of empty vials and syringes over here. Morphine sulfate. He's in pain. This is good. Excuse me? If he has the presence of mind to self-medicate, then maybe we can talk him into coming back to isolation before he infects anyone else. I don't know. He... he had this look in his eyes. It wasn't... it wasn't quite human. What else did he do? You mean aside from climbing this cage like Spiderman? He said something. He said, "You're here for a reason." Only not me, he said Walker. Jules? I think he left us a trail to follow. I'll get a security team. I'm going with you. Not this time, Doc. Things have been getting out of hand, and you know we can't afford to lose you. But I'll tell you what, though. How about you be my wingman? Now I know what a TV dinner feels like. I didn't think you were old enough to remember that one. Die Hard? Sure, saw it in third grade.  Tsk. Ouch. You see anything up there yet? Nada. How do we even know he's still up here? If I know Peter, he's still up there. What makes you so sure? He used to hide in the attic when we were kids, when our dad was drinking or angry, which was a lot. Keep the chatter down. We don't want to scare him away. No offence, but I don't think he's the one who's scared. Will you look up? I can't see anything. Join the club. What was that? What was what? Tilt your head up about 20 degrees. Now look left. It's dark up here. Get it? Check your six. Make sure he's not behind you. Holy sh1t! Ugh! Balleseros! (Peter breathing) Is he all right? I'm not sure. Is he infected? Well, he's still breathing, none of that black sh1t on him. His pulse is steady. What happened up there? Hell if I know. One minute I was alone. the next minute, I'm getting a face full of your brother. I guess I must have nailed us both with that bug zapper. That stun baton packs 600kV. It should have knocked him out cold. Seems like a lot of things that should be happening with Peter aren't. Base One. OK, we're on our way. Elevator alarm just went off upstairs. Someone's trying to leave the base. NARVIK-A subjects are decimated. Close to a 100% mortality rate. And NARVIK-B? Morbidity at 100%, but mortality at zero. They're infected but still alive. It's been a long time since I did real lab work. Guess you forget how tedious it can be. No, I miss it. The precision, commitment, sacrifice, all leading to the joy of discovery. My mother used to say something just like that. She was also a scientist? Cellular biologist, yeah. She died when I was very young. I am sorry. What about your father? (Glass shattering) (Rats squeaking) Oh, my god. (Man groaning in pain) Can't you make him stop? Morphine isn't working. If I give him any more, I might kill him. Yeah, maybe that's not such a bad idea. Nice. I suppose you'd feel the same way if it was you lying there? Look, I feel sorry for Haven, but those are the breaks. Everybody, please. We just need to be patient. That's easy for you to say, you're back inside that suit. This is just a precaution until we figure out a treatment. You're not figuring out a treatment. In fact, I don't think you know a damn thing about this virus at all. Stop it! Stop. We're all doctors here, right? Instead of bickering, let's put our heads together. Yeah, let's get her to let us out of here. You know I can't do that. There's a chance that you could infect others or become violent... And what if someone gets violent inside this box, huh? What are we supposed to do then? Open the door. At least let us go back to our labs. No. (Sarah gasps.) Do what you want, but I'm not letting you out of here. Then you're gonna call someone who will. Base One. OK. We have to go back. Why? A couple of detainees are demanding to be let loose. They're holding Dr. Jordan. Go. I'll check outside, secure the perimeter. Security teams, confirm level lockdown. Release Dr. Jordan at once. Then we can talk. Let us out and she comes with us. No harm done. If you let us go back to our labs, we can help with the virus. Bryce is a hematologist. I'm a biochemist. You are in isolation for your own safety. More like rats in a box. We're not gonna die in here. We are working on an antiviral therapy. As soon as we run animal trials... Animal trials could take weeks! We're not going to be around that long, and you know it. Dr. Farragut. I need you to let Dr. Jordan go. Uh-uh! Don't come any closer! Look, we're working as hard as we can to figure this thing out, and we won't stop until we do. We both know that's a crock of sh1t. Hear him out, Bryce. Listen, I'm in here with you, not out there. We will work this out. All right? Just give me the syringe and let Dr. Jordan go. Why should we trust you? Dr. Farragut. Now we're in this together. Alan, what you did back there... Thank you. I was just doing my job. And so were you by not letting them leave. I had a good teacher. Yeah? Do I know him? There's no risk anyway, what with the lack of airborne transmission. Jules, what is it? I need to show you something. The NARVIK-A subjects died horribly... lesions, hemorrhagic shock, liquification of internal organs. But the NARVIK-B subjects didn't die. They became highly aggressive, agitated. Sounds like a lyssavirus. Maybe some form of rabies? Rabies doesn't include a compulsion to spread the contagion. I've never seen a pathogen with such focused behavioral patterns. The B samples are acting just like vectors. Vectors on steroids. I think the B virus rewires the brain to create a perfect contagion machine. Like Peter. Dr. Farragut, Dr. Hatake would like a word with you. And I'd like a word with him. Get down to isolation. Check on the infected patients. If what you've discovered is true, we're not just dealing with a single virus anymore. (Motor failing to start) Going for a spin? It's a brisk night. I hope you brought your woolies. This doesn't have anything to do with you. Still, I'm gonna have to ask you to return back to the base. If you had any idea what they were doing here, you'd be getting the hell out yourself. The transgenic experiments, the virus vaults... Unregulated research sounds great until you're actually doing it. What they did to those monkeys was... was an abomination. Come back inside. I want to hear about this. I'm not going back. Just come back inside. You're gonna freeze out here. People have to know what's going on up here. We have to tell the newspapers. Hell, we have to tell everyone. (Stab) (Groaning) You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You don't have to go back in there right now. I can handle it. I'm good, thanks. (Door opening) A little help? Meet Dr. Tracey. She's in the advanced stages, but I got her tranqued up on monkey juice. Took me a long damn time to haul her ass up here. And there's some other monkey business I think Dr. Farragut would like to hear about. You're not bringing her in here, are you? She's going straight into the ICU chamber. You won't have any contact. A little late for that, isn't it? (Grunting) He's seizing! I need a crash cart! Do it now. Ah! Come on, let's get out of here! This virus was less of a danger before the CDC arrived. My people were the ones attacked in there. Yours were doing the attacking. I thought you had that situation under control. I was mistaken. And I thought we had the full picture, not to mention complete access. Maybe you can tell me how it is that patients here just go missing, or how a member of my team is attacked by an infected monkey she was told didn't exist in the first place. Or maybe you'd like to tell me why my brother was tinkering with maybe the worst contagion this world has seen in his own damn lab? You should ask your brother. I would never encourage something so reckless. First things first: how do we contain the infected patients? We don't, not without complete transparency. And if I refuse? We came here to help. You no longer want that help? That's fine. But it seems to me we're the last chance you have. So, maybe we give each other what we want, what we need... and just maybe we all get out of here alive. (Breathing unsteadily) I'm sorry. For what? It's not your fault. I should've been there. Ah, don't beat yourself up. We'll get them back. I didn't keep you off the search because of Peter. I didn't want to... I lost you once. I appreciate that, I do. But I'm not your responsibility anymore. You can't keep trying to protect me. I don't know that I can stop. (Door opening) (Door closing) (Happy instrumental music) Julia. Peter. Ah! No. No! No! No! Please! Peter! Please! (Screaming)
