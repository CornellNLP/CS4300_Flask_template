 Previously on  Helix... 
 I ate all of it. Now I'm sick. 
 You must decide what kind of man you want to be: one who fears, or one who inspires fear. 
 Right now, we have a job to do. Loose ends that need to be tied up. 
 None of them can leave the island. 
 WOO! Looks like I got me a big one! 
 Ooh... (groaning) 
 Ilaria's planning to release a new version of Narvik worldwide. 
 When? 
 Two days. 
 Contact your superiors. 
 I'm not getting any response. 
 Where's Mother? 
 150 yards north of the main gate. 
 Am I looking at a rescue? 
 Just the opposite. 
 They're going to kill everything on the island. 
 (engines roaring) (gas hissing) 
 (gagging) 
 PETER! 
 (choking) 
 YOU CHEATED ME! 
 You found Mother! 
 Oh, no, it's dead! 
 Now the rest of the world's going to be dead, too. 
 (grunting) 
 (The Flower Duet  from  Lakmé  playing) 
 (screaming and cackling) 
 (yelping) 
 (screaming) 
 There's no going back now. 
 Why would you want to? 
 What has the world outside ever given to you? 
 Nothing. 
 Less than nothing. 
 I wanted to be a healer. 
 That's your past talking. 
 You're so much more than that now. 
 You have shed your old clothing along with your old life. 
 You're reborn now. 
 Ascendant. 
 Under your guidance, we will prevail. 
 We will take back our abbey. 
 Our island. 
 Why stop there? 
 The outside world is soul-sick, Anne. 
 Why not heal it? 
 We can expand our reach all the way to the mainland. 
 The island has always been our home. 
 That's your past talking. 
 First, we need to break the naval blockade. 
 What we lack is leverage. 
 We need to control something they want. 
 How? 
 We're trapped here. 
 Trapped with the CDC. 
 They've discovered a cure for mycosis. 
 We need to get our hands on that cure. 
 Then we eliminate them. 
 Ow... Stings a bit. 
 It's better than the alternative. 
 What's this for? 
 You need it worse than I do. 
 Coast guard needs it too. Get it off the island. 
 I... I don't know what to say. 
 I mean, I tried to kill you yesterday. 
 That wasn't you. It was the pathogen. 
 I was wrong about you. 
 I used to think there was a right and a wrong, no in between, but immortality turned all that upside-down. 
 If I were you, I'd forget I ever set foot on this island. 
 Can't do that. When this is all over, I still got to turn you in. 
 I tell you what, I'll make you a deal. 
 When this is all over, I'll turn myself in. 
 But first I need a favour. 
 Alright. 
 I need to borrow your gun. 
 And I need to know what happened in Paris. 
 First Bank of Atlanta. 
 Safety deposit box 274. 
 You'll find all the proof you need. 
 Mother's dead. 
 No fungal antigens, nothing. 
 You could try an ammonium nitrogen-based fertilizer. 
 That would take a month. I've only got one day before the Narvik release. 
 Did you hear what I said? 
 Sorry, what? 
 Nothing. 
 Just the end of the human race as we know it. 
 You'll figure something out. You always do. 
 What is that? 
 Homemade fluorocarbon. 
 Highly oxygenated, breathable. 
 It's similar to what Dr. Adrian was using on Peter to keep him alive at ABS, and I think it might work here. 
 For how long? 
 Indefinitely, as long as he is receiving fresh infusions every 30 minutes. 
 You're going to inject fluid into that jar every half hour for the rest of your life? 
 If I have to. 
 (door opening) 
 Alan : Jules? 
 Oh, my God... 
 Is that... our child? 
 Why don't I, uh, let you two have some time alone? 
 So that's where the root came from. 
 Anne : The Mother Tree. She's the reason we're on this island. 
 Michael discovered her so many years ago. 
 Her root system contained amazing medicinal properties. 
 Like infertility? 
 Michael spent decades studying her. 
 After she died, he took pieces of the root and grafted them onto other plantings. 
 The piece that was lost was the last remnant of the original tree. 
 I need to go to the tree's location. 
 There may be viable seeds or pieces of root left behind. 
 That's not possible. 
 I know it's a long shot, but I have to try! 
 You misunderstand. I'd take you there if I could. 
 Michael was the only one who knew its location. 
 But this painting... 
 Is nearly 300 years old. 
 It's a view from a hill near the abbey, but the tree is long gone. There must be some record. 
 You're welcome to look through Michael's ledgers, provided you have Eli's permission. 
 Who's Eli? 
 Eli, Dr. Walker would like a word. 
 (inhaling deeply) 
 (laughing) 
 What the hell? Ha! 
 Peter! 
 Where are your clothes? 
 Peter is dead. 
 This is Eli, the new leader of our order. 
 Eli... Alright, you're kidding, right? 
 A new man deserves a new name. 
 Eli means "ascendant" in... 
 I don't care what it means. 
 Peter, you're a doctor. 
 Are you going to throw away everything for this? 
 I found a higher calling, a sense of purpose, a place to belong, much like you did. 
 Alright, Eli... 
 I need full access to Michael's records. 
 That won't be a problem, as long as we get something in return. 
 I already offered you immunity from Ilaria. 
 I want the same for my followers. 
 Ilaria stays off this island. No persecution, no Narvik, nothing. 
 I can arrange that. 
 Plus a royalty on the sale of the infertility apples. 
 10 per cent... Make it 20! 
 Oh, come on! 
 (sighing) It looks like you're still Peter after all, hmm? 
 He's been fed. 
 It's time for his nap. 
 Anne... 
 Gather the followers in the council hall. 
 Have them arm themselves. 
 It's time to take care of our CDC problem. 
 (baby babbling) 
 Anne : Yes, Eli. 
 (theme music playing) 
 You sure you're OK, Dr. Connor? 
 I'm fine, Soren. 
 Gotta get to the lab, help Dr. Jordan. 
 But what about your my... Uh... 
 Mycosis? 
 Yeah! 
 I'm getting better, just like you did. Dr. Alan fixed me. 
 I want to fix people, too. 
 Is that right? 
 Yeah. I can come work with you at the CDC. 
 I'd have you on my team anytime. 
 Soren, I need to talk to Dr. Kyle alone. 
 But I'm helping him. 
 Now! 
 Don't backtalk me. 
 You need to get out of here now. 
 Out of where? 
 The island. Get as far away as you can. 
 Believe me, I'm trying. 
 What's going on? 
 I don't want him to kill Dr. Alan, you and Dr. Jordan. 
 Him who? 
 Eli! 
 Peter! He won't let you leave the island alive. 
 You heard him say that? 
 He wants the cure, and once he gets it, you're going to end up in a barrel. 
 I found this. 
 There's a coastguard radio in there. 
 Call for help. Do whatever, just get off the island! 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 You saved my Soren, you, and Dr. Alan. 
 Alan : It doesn't seem possible. 
 There's no scientific evidence to explain it, but... 
 Not yet. 
 But it doesn't matter how. 
 The fact is that he's alive in this jar, and I need to find a way to get him off this island. 
 What kind of life is he going to have? 
 I don't know, but I am willing to spend an eternity to figure out a way for him to have a normal life. 
 Why don't you come with me? If there's anybody who can help me figure this out, it's you. 
 Sarah, I... 
 I can't. 
 You can't. 
 He's your son too. 
 But you can't, because of your obsession with Ilaria and killing Immortals. 
 Well, why don't you start with me, Alan? I'm standing here right in front of you. 
 I have to finish what I started. 
 I should have told you I was going to see Dr. Kyle. 
 No, no, no, Soren, you didn't do anything wrong. Now I need you to listen to me. 
 Mommy made a terrible mistake. 
 What did you do? 
 I can't explain right now, but I'm trying to fix it, so I need you to do something for me. 
 Remember when we used to play hide-and-seek, that spot you used to hide? 
 But I don't want to hide. 
 Dr. Kyle's my friend. I can help too. 
 You can help by staying out of sight. 
 Soren, promise me. 
 I promise. 
 (gasping) 
 You scared me. 
 I figured I'd find you up here, pouring through 500 years of clues. 
 Believe me, there's not much to find. What do you want, Alan? 
 Actually, I came to apologize. 
 I came at you pretty hard yesterday. 
 It was unfair. 
 I appreciate that. 
 I'd like to help. 
 Find anything of use? 
 Uh... 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 This is a painting of the Mother Tree. 
 I might be able to use reference points to determine its location. 
 Assuming the painting's true to life. 
 We have no way of knowing if it's accurate. 
 Well, Michael was a geneticist, but over the centuries, he was also an artist, a cartographer and an astronomer. 
 The man had a lot of time on his hands. 
 Landscapes change, mountains erode, and, uh, forests die, but one thing stays the same, the stars. 
 Do you remember that weekend in Yosemite? 
 With the leaky tent? 
 You said there was a way to use astronomical coordinates to determine a precise location. 
 Declination and ascension, yeah. 
 Right. You were showing off. 
 I was trying to show you where Ansel Adams shot  Autumn Moon. 
 You were trying to get me back in the tent. 
 What if there's a way to compare the stars in the sky to the stars in the painting? 
 It's a good theory, but we have no idea when this was painted. 
 No, but that might only be the difference of a few degrees. 
 It could still give us an idea of the tree's location. 
 It's good work. 
 chuckling : Yeah. 
 The work's just getting started. 
 Sarah! Thank God you're here! We gotta pack up and get out. 
 What the hell is that? 
 It's my son. 
 Your what? 
 When were you pregnant? 
 It was a... 
 No, stop. You know what? 
 You can explain it to me on the way. 
 Nothing on this island surprises me anymore. 
 No, I'm not going anywhere. 
 Sarah, please! They're coming to kill us. 
 Who? 
 Peter's gone off the deep end. 
 We gotta call for an evac or we're going to be scattered in that boneyard. 
 Come on, Sarah, we gotta go! 
 Don't rush me. 
 Sarah, come on, please! 
 Do not rush me! 
 Too late. They're coming. 
 (slamming) 
 Kyle, stop! 
 We gotta keep moving. What's wrong? 
 Something's leaking onto my back. 
 No... 
 It's leaking! 
 What... 
 What are you doing? 
 Juicy Fruit. There is no substitute. 
 Did this with my fishbowl back home. 
 Your fish was named Copernicus, mine was Eggman. 
 Figures. 
 Yeah, that'll hold it for a while. We gotta get the hell up there, call for an evac. 
 No, no, he can't live inside a cracked jar. I have to get him a new one. 
 Well, where do you think we're going to find that? 
 Amy said there are more jars inside the Abbey, and since she's currently indisposed, I have to find Anne. 
 Come on, you gotta be kidding. 
 You can go if you want. I'm not going to stop you, but if I don't get him another jar in 30 minutes he's going to die. 
 OK. 
 We'll split up and find Anne. Meet back here in 30 minutes. 
 No, Kyle, you don't have to. 
 I'm not leaving without you or your son. 
 
 
 
 Alan : Can barely recognize this place. 
 It'll take time, but the island will heal. 
 Incredible what nature can do when left alone. 
 Is that another Ilaria save the planet talking point? 
 Look out there, Alan. It's the hand of man. 
 It's what we do best, isn't it? Take something beautiful then destroy it. 
 And Ilaria never destroyed anything. 
 Only in service of the greater good. 
 Jesus! 
 You can't believe that, can you? 
 Alan, it doesn't matter what I believe. 
 There's no defeating Ilaria. 
 They are everywhere: in every major city, in every branch of government. I've seen their plans. 
 Has it ever occurred to you that they might be lying? 
 About what? 
 Narvik-C? 
 Think about it, Jules. 
 Hatake needed several lifetimes to do what some genius at Ilaria perfected in under a year? 
 Wow. 
 It's not just the beard. You've really gone full conspiracy theorist. 
 Look... I know this can't be easy for you. It wasn't easy for me, either. 
 That's the thing. 
 It was too easy. 
 I killed all those Immortals for you, Jules, and I'd have killed 10000 more. 
 For you. 
 You were the one, Alan. 
 You're the closest I came to knowing anyone and I tried to let you know me too, but there was just something missing. 
 I was missing. 
 No. It wasn't you. 
 I know you want to believe you could have done something to change things. It's me. 
 It's what I am. 
 My father Hatake, immortality... 
 Arctic Biosystems was the worst and best thing that ever happened to me, because I finally made sense. 
 (baby cooing) 
 whispering : He's asleep. 
 The CDC doctors have fled. 
 And the cure? 
 We scoured the entire lab. They must have taken it with them. 
 I'm so sorry, I should have known. 
 Don't apologize. I'm not Michael. 
 You could never disappoint me. 
 Someone must have warned them. 
 But who would do such a thing? 
 No one else... 
 Olivia. She was in the room with us. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Keep the search going for the CDC. 
 I'll handle everything else. 
 Show no mercy. 
 Show no mercy. 
 Julia : OK, where are you, Polaris? 
 Right in the Big Dipper, and from those two pointer stars, five times the distance. 
 There she is. 
 The North Star. 
 This can't be right. 
 Well, maybe it's just a painting, Jules. 
 I combed through Michael's files for hours. 
 He was meticulous about his work, almost obsessive. Why would he be different on this? 
 So we have the star. 
 Where's the hill? 
 It's there. 
 It's almost as if... 
 Oh! 
 I assumed we were at the vantage point, but I got it backwards. 
 The star, the hill... 
 The triangulation point is... 
 It's at the steeple! The tree's here, at the abbey! 
 (muffled voices) 
 woman : Maybe there's someone over here. 
 man : All clear! 
 (approaching footsteps) 
 Eli! 
 (lamp rattling) 
 You seem nervous, Olivia. 
 Is anything wrong? 
 No! I just really want to find my Soren, make sure he's OK. 
 If you care about your son, why risk everything by telling the CDC we were coming for them? 
 No, Eli. I would never betray you. 
 There's no need to lie. 
 That will only make it worse. 
 (screaming) 
 (glass smashing) 
 Please, I just want to be with my son! 
 Please, I just want to be with him! 
 I know you do. 
 (Olivia choking) 
 Olivia... I know. 
 (neck cracking) 
 (short gasp) 
 I'm sorry, but... we gotta go before they come back. 
 Soren... 
 Why did he kill my mom? 
 No reason. 
 He's just an evil man who did a terrible thing. 
 He's a doctor like you. 
 He's supposed to fix people! 
 Sometimes people pretend to be someone they're not. 
 I don't want to pretend. 
 I want to be someone else. 
 Hey, no one deserves what you've been through. 
 And after all I did to you, you still saved me and Alan. 
 I'd say that makes you the bravest person I've ever met. 
 I'm not brave. 
 I could have saved her, but I was too scared. 
 Soren, you listen to me. Listen: none of this is your fault. 
 You hear me? None of it. 
 I lost my mom, too, when I was just a few years older than you. 
 I still think about her every day. 
 That wish is always with me, no matter what. 
 But my mom was my only family and now I'm all alone. 
 I'll be your family now, if you want. 
 I'll check over here. Take this side. 
 They're not here. Split up and circle the grounds. 
 The doctors can't have gone far. 
 (object clattering) 
 Put it down. 
 Not one word. 
 I understand. 
 Now what do you want, Dr. Jordan? 
 Michael's premature baby experiments: where are the life support units? 
 Why? 
 Because I'm the one holding the knife. 
 There's no need to threaten me, just settle down. 
 Sit. 
 Where are they? 
 If I refuse to say... 
 You're going to tell me one way or another. 
 Julia : This place is so beautiful. 
 Michael built himself a shrine to Mother Nature. 
 It's hard to believe somebody capable of so much beauty could be responsible for so many horrors. 
 More common than you'd think. 
 What was he like, Michael? 
 What kind of man was he? 
 Loved the sound of his own voice. 
 A narcissist? 
 A lunatic. 
 He did have a gift for words, alright. 
 Hell for Michael was a room without an audience. 
 Jules... 
 What are we doing? The tree's not here. 
 Is this where he would speak? 
 He called it "counselling". 
 (floor making crunching noise) 
 (bag dropping) 
 Jules, what the hell are you... 
 (slamming) 
 (hammering) 
 (wood splitting) 
 Help me! 
 Help you what? 
 Help me pull up this floor. 
 (wood cracking) 
 The Mother Tree, Michael built the abbey right on top of it! 
 He must have had some way to access its roots. 
 There's an extensive tunnel system under the abbey, but we don't have a painting to guide us. 
 Good thing I have you! 
 Where are they? 
 If you turn yourself over to Eli, he may show you mercy. 
 Who's Eli? 
 I believe you knew him as Peter Farragut. 
 (snorting) 
 Peter is a lot of things. 
 And he will be so much more to so many people. 
 You're serious? 
 It's no wonder that Amy turned out the way that she did. 
 You have no idea what it is to be a parent. 
 I am a parent. 
 No, you're not. 
 That thing over there is not a child. 
 Shut up! 
 And keeping it like that is cruel and pointless. 
 If I hear one more word out of your mouth that isn't the location of those jars... 
 Why don't you put that away? We both know you won't use it! 
 Oh, really? 
 (screaming) 
 (strange gasping and breathing) 
 What the hell is this place? 
 weakly : This is where Michael bestowed his greatest gift upon the world. 
 The gift of life. 
 (gasping and breathing) 
 (gasping) 
 What have you done to them, their throats, their voices? 
 Only in silence could they find peace. 
 (groaning and gasping) 
 Where are the life support units? 
 WHERE ARE THEY? 
 (sighing) Release them. 
 All of them. 
 I will not. 
 You can do it with half your toes or none at all. 
 (gasping) 
 (strangled gurgling) 
 When I was a boy, 
 I used to dream they made a mistake at the hospital, that they switched babies. 
 I used to pray that... 
 That I didn't actually belong to that family, to that man. 
 Now I understand that blood is meaningless. 
 (baby babbling) 
 You are my son, my family. 
 Years at med school couldn't teach me what you did in just one day. 
 DNA, RNA, the building blocks... 
 That's not what it is to be human, what it means to be a man, a father. 
 (baby cooing) 
 It's all the things we can't see that make us who we are. 
 Love, hope. 
 I want to give you everything my father didn't give me. 
 Blood is meaningless. 
 Family... is everything. 
 (Julia grunting) 
 Oh, my God! 
 This is unbelievable. 
 We're inside the root system of a tree. 
 Come on... 
 The tree's dead, Jules. 
 Probably been dead for generations. 
 An organism this big? 
 There are root systems that have been alive for 80000 years. 
 Trees, not stumps! 
 We're too late. 
 (vials clinking) 
 (gasping) 
 (glass shattering) 
 Mayday, mayday,  this is Dr. Kyle Summer with the CDC. 
 Requesting immediate evacuation from St. Germain Island. Do you copy? 
 (radio producing static) 
 Mayday, mayday, this is Dr. Kyle Summer with the... 
 Sarah! Did you find Anne? 
 I found her. 
 Did you get her to talk? 
 She talked. 
 What happened? Whose blood is that? 
 I'll tell you after about five years of therapy. 
 Mayday, mayday, this is Dr. Kyle Summer with the CDC requesting immediate evacuation from St. Germain island. Does anybody copy? 
 (static) 
 man : [This is the USS Portledge, you're on] 
 [a priority military channel. Sign off immediately.] 
 This is Dr. Kyle Summer. We need an evac! 
 [I don't care who you are, switch your frequency! ] 
 Listen up! 
 I have a cure for the pathogen that's infecting your ships, so if you want it, you better put somebody on the line that can get me an evac! 
 [Hold for Captain Wilson.] 
 (dragging footsteps) (laboured breathing) 
 (gasping) 
 Anne! Oh, my God... 
 (groaning) 
 What happened? 
 Who did this to you? Who? 
 weakly : Dr. Jordan. 
 Sarah? 
 She made me take her to the birthing chamber. 
 We need to get you to the infirmary. 
 No! 
 You have to stop her and Dr. Summer. 
 They're trying to leave the island. 
 Where are they now? 
 Julia : No, no, no, no! 
 Alan : What happened? 
 The test vials are broken. I don't have any more. 
 Well then, there's nothing you can do. 
 Look, do you see this? 
 The fungal enzyme, it spilled into the ground. 
 Do you know what this means? 
 It's Mother! 
 She's everywhere! 
 (wind howling) 
 Alright, Soren, you'll go first, then you, Sarah. 
 (gunshot) 
 pilot : We're taking fire! Hang on! 
 Come back! 
 The fungus, it... 
 It's in the soil around the roots. 
 But you don't have the root. 
 I don't need it. 
 Mother was just a repository for the fungus. With modern gene splicing, We can insert the fungus into any plant we want. 
 We can create widespread infertility without any mycotic effects. 
 This is incredible. We can create seeds, plantings, whole orchards in the span of a few years. 
 This will eliminate the need for Narvik. 
 (cocking gun) 
 I'm sorry, Jules. 
 Alan, what are you doing? 
 Stopping Ilaria. 
 By killing me? 
 I'm trying to stop them, too. 
 No. 
 If you do this, you're as bad as they are. 
 Alan, you're making a huge mistake. Please. 
 You have to let me go. 
 I can't.
