 Previously on Helix...  
 There's no baby. 
 The good doctors from the CDC have developed a serum to combat the illness. 
 Peter : Mass suicide. 
 (Door opening) 
 What is this? 
 There has been a change of plans. 
 You can't do this to me! 
 I will live forever! 
 We are responsible for the abbey now. 
 Not you and me; Just me. 
 I won't let you destroy our home. 
 The CDC sent us back for you. You're being evacuated. 
 This is no longer the only island under quarantine. 
 They've lost 75 people. 
 We can't leave. We need to examine this mycotic right away. 
 The mycotics outside the wall are not dying. We need to figure out why. 
 I found this in his stomach. 
 That looks like tree sap. 
 He's been practically living off it. 
 This gunk may lead to a cure? 
 It's the only lead we have. 
 At the very least, we need to get out there and investigate, find out what this is all about. 
 Tell me what happened to me and my baby. 
 Amy : I'd be happy to give it back to you. 
 You just have to give me something in return: Immortality. 
 man : When'll the stew be ready? 
 It'll be ready when it's ready. 
 A meal takes time. 
 I'm hungry now. 
 You're always hungry. Not my problem. 
 My problem's your cooking. 
 You ever gonna make anything edible? 
 When are you gonna act like a man instead of sitting whining? 
 Looks like sh1t. 
 Tastes like it too. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 How does it feel? 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 (Man yelling) 
 Ahhh! (Man growling) 
 (Both grunting) 
 Woman : Get off me! 
 (Grunting and scuffling) 
 (Fire crackling) 
 What are you doing here? 
 Trying to stay warm. don't these coasties know how to keep a frackin' fire going? 
 Aren't you... 
 Dead? Checked out? 
 Taking the ol' dirt nap? don't look at me. 
 You're the one dreaming this up. 
 Dig the beard. 
 Very anti-establishment... screw the man and all that... but, uh, I gotta ask... 
 What are you trying to prove? 
 Maybe I just like the way it looks. 
 It makes you look like one of the village people. 
 (Chuckling) 
 What the hell are you really doing out here, Alan? 
 I'm trying to stop Ilaria. 
 By traipsing through the forest with a bunch of sailors? 
 Not to mention this Kyle guy who's trying to get your butt thrown in federal prison. 
 Ilaria have come up with a new pathogen. 
 I'm not sure why, but I... 
 Ah, horse sh1t. 
 You and I both know that ain't the real reason you're out here. 
 Of course it is. 
 Humor me. 
 First, you were trying to save Julia. 
 Then, you were hunting a bunch of immortals in Paris. And now, you're trying to find a cure for this pathogen. 
 Seems to me like you're a man in search of a mission. 
 I know why I'm here, Doreen. 
 Oh, I don't think you do. 
 And you need to wake up. 
 You hear me? 
 Wake up, Alan. 
 Wake up. 
 Alan, wake up. 
 Keep at it, I'll put that boot up your ass. 
 I just figured you might want to stay with the gang here, but you can sleep till noon if you want. 
 Look, we don't have to get along. 
 We don't get along, Doc. 
 But we're in this together, like it or not, so let's get it done. 
 You get a headcount? 
 Ok, take three men, maintain visual contact, check the perimeter, then uphill. 
 What's happening? 
 One of our guys hasn't reported in. 
 Must have just overslept. 
 I know you've been through unspeakable horror, the loss of friends and loved ones. But I can promise you, we will prevail. 
 Say it with me. 
 All : We will prevail. 
 When will it be safe for us to eat or drink? 
 Dr. Farragut has assured me that our remaining food and water supplies are uncompromised. 
 Why did Michael lie to us? 
 Why did he kill everyone? 
 What Michael did was a terrible mistake. You're all safe now. 
 The CDC... 
 Michael said the CDC was here to keep us safe, but they're the ones that brought the sickness. 
 No. That's absolutely not true. 
 Amy : Lies and more lies. 
 Michael, who called himself our brother, fell prey to the evil words of the outsiders, and now my mother is following his path. 
 How dare you speak to me that way? 
 I will speak to you any way I like! 
 We are no longer afraid of you and Michael. 
 For years we leaned on tradition, went about our work, and reassured ourselves the old ways are the safest ways, the surest ways. 
 But we have been led down a path to ruin. 
 Whole families lost to sickness or poison. 
 The old ways are dead! 
 The time has come to move on, to open ourselves to our new incarnation. 
 Skeptics and outsiders have done their best to destroy us. 
 And Anne... 
 Has embraced them, even laying with one of them! 
 (People murmuring) 
 That's not true! 
 They misled my mother and Michael, but they shall not mislead us. 
 Come! 
 Join me. 
 ♪ ♪ ♪ (Happy tropical music) 
 (Door opening) 
 (Door closing) 
 Peter : Anne? Anne. 
 Your daughter has Michael's gift for empty speech. 
 Not only empty, but cruel. 
 I'm sorry she singled you out. 
 It was... Unforgivable. 
 No need to apologize for Amy. 
 Why not? I'm her mother. 
 Her failure is my failure. 
 That's not true. 
 You have to stop blaming yourself for everything that goes on here. 
 I've spent my life doing exactly what I've been told. 
 No one ever listened to me, except when I repeated what Michael said. 
 If I disagreed, I was yelled at. 
 But I put up with it because I believed in him. 
 Two days ago in the oubliette, you yelled at me. 
 Anne, I'm sorry. 
 No, it's fine. 
 The point is, I yelled back. 
 I felt... safe with you. 
 You were right, and you listened. You listened. 
 The survivors of the thinning aren't the only ones in need of a savior. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm not going down without a fight. 
 Amy may think she has control of the abbey, but I have... 
 (Phone beeping) 
 Oh, my god. 
 What is it? 
 I haven't had a chance to get up here since I was trapped in that pit. 
 There must be a hundred new messages. 
 They're here. They're already here on the island. 
 Who's here? 
 The answer to our problem. 
 I thought you said this hike was an hour tops. 
 An hour as the crow flies. 
 We could have taken the Ilaria chopper. 
 Not without raising a dozen red flags. 
 We need to get in, find Michael and the infertility bio tech quickly and quietly. 
 And what if this Michael doesn't want to cooperate? 
 Then we reason with him. 
 I haven't heard from Peter in five days. 
 Who knows what kind of sh1t storm we're walking into? 
 I don't want to use force unless it's absolutely necessary. 
 It might be. 
 Ah, Dr. Jordan. I thought I might find you here. 
 The curious scientist. 
 Is this some kind of game to you, you crazy bitch? 
 Uh-uh, language. 
 Do I need to have Landry wash your mouth out with soap? 
 You know, I am willing to give you a trade, if you give me what I want. 
 I can't make you immortal. 
 I've never done the procedure. 
 "Can't," 
 "never", those are self-defeating words. 
 That's just the kind of negative thinking that can lead to a terrible accident. 
 Stop it! 
 How long... 
 Do you think the child could live outside the jar? 
 What are you... don't do... 
 Five minutes? 
 Don't! Stop it! 
 Two? 
 Ok, wait, wait! I'll... 
 I'll do it, whatever you want. 
 I thought you might see the light. 
 Radio: Lieutenant Commander, we found him. 
 (Soldier retching) 
 Soldier : Oh, my god. 
 You're no doubt wondering how exactly our little organism survives. 
 When Michael decided to raise children separately from their parents, he naturally encountered resistance, so he tried separating babies and mothers pre-birth. 
 But how to keep the babies alive? Well, he devised a neutral environment, a synthetic womb in which babies could gestate without all those... 
 Troublesome emotional attachments. 
 You people are insane. 
 And your opinion is noted. 
 Anyway, it didn't work. 
 They lived a few weeks, which isn't bad, but... 
 Ultimately... A dead end. 
 (Amy chuckling) 
 You see, he could only use the jar for a baby that never grew, one frozen in its development, as if it were... immortal. 
 Don't... don't. Don't do that. 
 Look, I don't care about you or your little tadpole. 
 Tell me how you became an immortal. 
 I was dying, and I received an infusion of spinal fluid from another immortal. 
 Sounds dangerous. 
 It can be, especially if the fluid is from one of us. 
 When I was little, I used to watch my father standing here, supervising his followers in the orchard. 
 Even then... 
 I thought maybe one day I would take his place. 
 And now I'm here. 
 But it's not enough. 
 I imagine there's never enough for people like you. 
 I want everything he had: His world and his eternity. 
 Make me immortal, and you will get your child back. 
 So... do we have a deal? 
 Good. 
 We'll do it today. 
 I can't do a spinal sample myself. 
 Alan can do it when he gets back. 
 I'm not waiting. 
 Well, who do you expect to do the procedure? You? 
 Why not me? 
 Because you're not a doctor! 
 If you make a mistake, you could leave me paralyzed. 
 Please, just let me talk to Peter. 
 Peter is off playing nursemaid to my poor mother. 
 No. 
 I want immortality today! 
 It's latched from the inside. 
 No way to get through or over unless you want to get lit up like a Christmas tree. 
 So, you're telling me there's no way in. 
 Could try knocking. 
 Julia. 
 Sergio. 
 Don't "Sergio" me. Why haven't you returned my messages? 
 It's a long story. 
 We don't have time for this. 
 I need to talk to somebody named Michael. 
 He is gone missing then who is in charge? 
 My name is Anne. 
 You arrive at a time of some change. 
 But you are welcome. 
 Whoever took out our guy is gonna try again, pick us off one at a time. 
 Keep your head on a swivel, teams of two, no wandering off. 
 Yes, ma'am. Listen up! Teams of two! 
 Fan out from here and sweep east! 
 I've seen this before, when we first arrived. 
 Winger : Any idea what it means? 
 A trail marker, maybe? 
 Yeah, it's a trail marker. 
 You have a better theory? 
 Yeah, there are crazies out here saying, 
 "go back wherever the hell you came from." 
 Can you two cut the chatter? 
 (Distant screaming) 
 Form up! Form up! 
 Soldier : You heard the commander! Form up! Go! Go! 
 Soren? 
 Jesus. 
 Are you ok? What happened to your eye? 
 I... I'm sorry, Dr. Kyle. 
 For what? 
 Are you aware of the Ilaria Corporation? 
 The name is unfamiliar to me. 
 In four days, they're going to launch a fatal virus, which will decimate a large percentage of the human population up to 5 billion deaths. 
 NARVIK? 
 A new strain, NARVIK-c. 
 It's self-replicating, so it'll spread around the globe in a matter of weeks, if not days. 
 I don't see how we can help. 
 Please don't waste my time. 
 I know about Michael's infertility experiments. 
 I want the bio tech. 
 Why should I give it to you? 
 Ilaria's unconcerned about how we slow population growth, just that it happens. If I can show them another way... 
 Using our infertility graphs. 
 Better that than slaughtering billions of people. 
 This is an outside-world problem. 
 It's a whole-world problem. 
 If they release the new NARVIK, no one is safe, not even on an island. 
 I'm asking for your help. 
 There's no need to lie. 
 You're not asking: Your man... 
 Is prepared to shoot me if I refuse. 
 Isn't that right? 
 You don't have it, do you? 
 It's in a safe place. 
 No. If you knew where it was, you'd already be taking bids. 
 I know Anne, and I know this abbey. 
 I can get you what you want. 
 For a price? 
 What do you want, Peter? 
 Guaranteed immunity from Ilaria when all this is over. 
 Done. 
 And a finder's fee: Nine figures. 
 You want $100 million? 
 To prevent 5 billion deaths, I'd say you're getting a bargain. 
 You're a pig. 
 And pigs get fed. 
 There's an indentation in between the third and fourth vertebrae. 
 Got it. 
 Angle the needle upward. 
 Insert the needle half an inch very slowly. 
 I don't know that I'd let anyone do this to me without anesthesia. 
 I can't tell you what to do if I'm taking a nap. 
 Ah! 
 Did I mention to do it slowly? 
 It's not going in. 
 The resistance is a membrane with fluid. 
 Push a fraction of an inch. This part is crucial. 
 Any further and you could damage my spinal cord. 
 Nothing's happening. 
 Ah! Take it out! Take it out! 
 What's going on? 
 You missed, you're in the nerve tissue. 
 What should I do? 
 Take it out, damn it! 
 You'll have to start over again. 
 You know, this isn't easy for me either. 
 (Sigh) 
 
 
 
 (Insects chirping) 
 (Groan) 
 (Tapping) 
 Good. 
 You're awake. So we get to see those pretty eyes. 
 Where am I? 
 You're a guest in our home. 
 See? 
 I even brought you supper. 
 (Grunting with effort) 
 What we need on this island is salt. 
 Did you bring any salt? 
 Sorry, fresh out. 
 Try some. 
 Ugh! 
 Smells great, but I'm not hungry. 
 I see. 
 You're too good to eat at my table. 
 Got one of the good bits. 
 (Retching) 
 The eyes are the best part. 
 No, really, I couldn't. 
 Well, that's it. 
 I said I'd look after you, but if you're gonna badmouth my cooking... 
 Man : What do you think you're doing?! 
 I was just looking at his eyes. 
 You stay away from him. 
 Look at ya. You're nowhere near ready... skinnier than one of them island rabbits. 
 Soldier : Nothing. 
 Any sign of Dr. Sommer? 
 The trail disappears up at the ridge. 
 There's no sign of anything within a quarter-mile radius. 
 We're going back to the abbey. 
 No, no. We leave him out here, he's dead. 
 He's probably dead already. 
 Look, winger, we're on the verge of finding a possible cure to maybe the world's worst pathogen. I'm not going back without it. 
 The men assigned to my command are not special forces or Navy seal, but they're men, and that guy hanging in the tree back there is one of their own. 
 Look, the only reason we were attacked is because we're getting closer. 
 Now, I'm sorry, but your man in the tree can't get any more dead than he is! 
 We keep searching. 
 Jeez. That coulda left a mark. 
 You're still here? 
 Someone's gotta knock some sense into that thick head of yours. 
 Guess the big log didn't do the trick. 
 Do me a favor: If you have a point to make, could you make it? don't get all snippy on me. 
 I'm just wondering if you've figured it out yet. 
 I'm afraid to ask. 
 Then I'll ask for you: What is it about this Kyle fellow that's got you so hot under the collar? 
 Nothing. I told you, I'm trying to stop Ilaria. 
 Oh, Ilaria this, Ilaria that. 
 You're starting to sound like a broken record. 
 What do you want from me, Doreen? 
 The truth, for starters. 
 You and I both know saving a kid doesn't amount to a hill o' beans as far as Ilaria's concerned. 
 If the shoe was on the other foot, he'd be halfway back to Seattle by now. 
 No, he believes in what he's doing. 
 How's that? 
 He's young, he's reckless, but he's not going through the motions. 
 He really believes it. 
 Now we're getting somewhere. 
 Doreen, you know exactly why I can't leave Kyle out here. 
 Yeah, well, he's as stubborn as you. 
 And doesn't back down from a fight. 
 He may even look a bit like you if you shave the damn beard. 
 Oh, and, uh, you may want to take care of that head wound. 
 They bleed like a son of a bitch. 
 What head wound? 
 Hey, you still here doc? 
 (Weak sigh) 
 I think so. 
 Lucky you're still in one piece. 
 What happened? 
 Booby trap. 
 We are getting close. 
 Closer than you think. 
 Thank god the mycotics are into juicy fruit. 
 It worked. 
 I did it. 
 Now we transfer it to a clean syringe and... 
 When you're ready, we reverse the procedure and inject it into your spine. 
 What's the matter? I thought this is what you wanted. 
 I'm not sure I trust you. 
 I trusted you. 
 What choice did you have? 
 I just want my child back. I held up my end of the bargain. 
 And I will hold up mine as soon as I know that you're not gonna try anything. 
 You want immortality, this is the only way. 
 Maybe we could try it on a rabbit. A test. 
 It doesn't work like that. 
 I'll do it. 
 What? 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 I'm not. You can try it on me first. 
 Why would you risk that? 
 She could be poisoning you. 
 Then I'll die. 
 But I get to protect you, and... if it works, then I get to be immortal too. 
 We could be together forever. 
 Fine. 
 Try it on him first. 
 That wasn't part of the deal. 
 It is now! 
 If you ever want to see your son again. 
 (Grunting with effort) 
 (Jars king) 
 Hey, can I get a drink of water? 
 Look, I'm sorry about the stew thing, but I'm... I'm dying of thirst. 
 Soren. 
 I... I'm sorry, Dr. Kyle. 
 For what? 
 For tricking you into coming here. 
 You didn't really trick me. 
 Plus, the big guy did the heavy work anyway. 
 What you got there? 
 It's from the bleeding tree. 
 The bleeding tree? 
 Yeah. 
 We eat it so we don't get more sick. 
 Soren, do you know what Cadmus and Carol do? 
 Y... you know how they get their food, right? 
 Yeah, they trap people... 
 And eat them. 
 That's right. 
 But I don't want to be on the menu. 
 If I help you, they'll eat the rest of me. 
 What do you mean, eat the rest of you? 
 Soren, listen. 
 I promise I won't let them hurt you anymore. 
 You can't I can't while I'm tied up here. 
 I need you to be brave. 
 No. 
 Please. 
 No. 
 Soren, please. 
 That's it. 
 Cadmus : Hey! 
 What's going on here? 
 How many days before you can give the procedure to Amy? 
 Another three to four days before I can donate any more spinal fluid. 
 You hear that, Amy? 
 I wish we could do it together right now. 
 Me too. 
 But we're going to be immortal together, so... 
 What's a few more days? 
 What's the holdup? 
 I'm waiting for the anesthetic to kick in. 
 Get it over with. 
 Unless you have some reason not to. 
 Ok, you might feel a slight amount of pressure. 
 (Landry groaning) 
 I don't... I don't feel any different. 
 (Landry groaning) 
 (Landry grunting) 
 Amy : Ow! Ah! 
 Help me! Hold him down! 
 (Landry grunting) 
 What's happening?! 
 I don't know. I've heard of patients who can reject a CSF infusion. 
 And I've heard of doctors who poison their patients! 
 I didn't do anything! 
 Yes, you did. 
 You just said goodbye to your baby! 
 (Lock turning) 
 (Growling) 
 Sergio : What's wrong? 
 There are no seeds. 
 Of course not. 
 But we need seeds to plant trees. 
 That's the point of this whole mission. 
 We don't need seeds. 
 We graft all our trees from the original root stalk. 
 We call her "mother". 
 Her? 
 Michael discovered mother quite by accident when the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight. 
 Only one tree survived, absorbing the fungus rather than being consumed by it. 
 Later, Michael discovered a curious effect in the fruit. 
 It made the mortal men who ate it unable to father children. 
 So all of this was created by accident? 
 Many of humanity's greatest discoveries were accidental: Penicillin, quinine, insulin. Why not mother? 
 I'd like to see her. 
 Of course. 
 First you won't eat my cooking... 
 Then you want to leave without saying goodbye! 
 Ah, yeah, where are my manners? 
 You're a funny one. 
 Lucky Caddy didn't catch you first. 
 Sometimes... He lets the rabbits run, just so he can have a good chase. 
 Says it tenderizes the meat. 
 Only trouble is, when he catches 'em... 
 He eats the eyes all to himself. 
 We will definitely be sharing yours. 
 Blue is my favorite color, tastes great with honey. 
 You eat the honey? 
 Course we do. 
 Isn't that dangerous? 
 Nah, I keep a jar of it all to me self. don't tell Caddy. 
 That's... that's funny. 
 He said the same thing about you. 
 What's that? 
 Ah, I probably shouldn't say anything. 
 Cadmus swore me to secrecy. 
 He did, did he? 
 Cross my heart and hope to die. 
 What'd he say? 
 Don't worry. You can trust me. 
 I'd like to, but... 
 You've seen how Cadmus gets when he's angry. 
 I can get angry too! 
 You tell me, little rabbit. 
 All right, all right, all right! 
 But you gotta promise not to say anything. 
 It's just... he wants both my eyes for himself. 
 Son of a bitch, I knew it! 
 Please, don't tell him I told you. 
 Some days I think I could kill him. 
 That's a good idea. Then you could eat his eyes. 
 What do you think we are? Savages? 
 We don't eat our own. 
 Why not? 
 Because it's wrong and the disease makes the meat rotten. 
 Everyone knows that! 
 We've taken extraordinary precautions where mother is concerned. 
 Nothing at the abbey is more important. 
 (Gasp) 
 N... no! 
 What's wrong? 
 She's gone. 
 Mother is gone. 
 (Insects chirping) 
 Whew! All right. 
 Come on, you can do this. Come on! 
 Come on. 
 Oh! 
 Come on. 
 (Kyle groans.) No... 
 Oh, what's this now? 
 Oh! 
 What happened to you? 
 I can't say. 
 Oh, come on now, you can tell me. 
 You tell me or I'll give you something to bleed about. 
 Who did that? 
 No, no. 
 No, Carol will get angry. 
 Ah... Carol. 
 She knows better. 
 She said she wanted 'em all to herself. 
 What are you talking about? 
 My eyes! 
 She wanted to take my eyes, but I wouldn't let her! 
 She did what? 
 She said she didn't care what you thought. 
 I told her you'd get angry, but she didn't care. 
 That bitch! Argh! 
 Never should have left her with fresh meat!
