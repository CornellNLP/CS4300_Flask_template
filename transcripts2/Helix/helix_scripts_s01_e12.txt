 Previously on Helix... 
 You believe you can save her? 
 No, but Julia can. 
 It's incredible. 
 So it worked. 
 Ugh, this migraine, it's killing me. 
 It's not a migraine. 
 A strike team will storm the base, looking for the virus, and leave nothing behind. 
 There is a hidden bunker underneath the base. 
 We will be safe there. 
 This was not your call to make! 
 I had a theory. 
 A theory that could get us all killed! 
 We can save everyone. We can get Peter back. 
 (vectors shrieking) 
 I think it's working. 
 (vectors shrieking) 
 This is a picture of me and my brothers twins. 
 If you scatter to the wind, you still have a fighting chance. 
 You can be the man you want to be, not the man they made you. 
 There is just one. 
 They call him The Scythe. 
 Initiate video. I need to speak with him immediately. 
 Location unknown, but I'm happy to report the cure does exist. 
 Yeah, no sh1t. 
 Now, can I please have my to-do list, so he can enjoy all the credit and I can get on with it? 
 We're in a bunker hiding for our lives. Would you choose diet? 
 Is there scotch involved in this scenario? 
 There is another way. Hatake's escape tunnel. 
 We can get everyone out of the base. 
 No, that's just it, Sarah. 
 They will find us, and they will kill us all. 
 And that's not the worst of it. 
 What we've seen of the virus so far, it's small scale. 
 Ilaria has worldwide ambitions, and we can't let them succeed. 
 There is no running, no hiding. 
 Either they survive, or we do. 
 You're healing fast. 
 Don't worry. Daniel will be back soon. 
 A parent always worries. 
 I'm sure he'll find the last group of scientists. 
 For his own sake, I hope not. 
 It is too late for them. (hatch opening) 
 The others? Did you find Duchamp? 
 That's Bennett. 
 Chang, Triantis. 
 I just can't help thinking whoever did this... 
 Was inhuman. 
 Was just like me. 
 From what I can see, The Scythe is a true sociopath. 
 Ilaria's hatchet man. 
 And yet your father worked for the very same corporation. 
 How do you defend that? 
 I don't. Not anymore. 
 I need a minute. 
 We need to keep moving, keep out of the open. 
 They could be watching. 
 I'm hoping that's exactly what they're doing, and we can lure them out. 
 Jesus. That's your plan? 
 I need you... down in the cabin. 
 I've tasked Sarah with keeping people calm and organized, but... they know you down there and they could use your help. 
 Given everything I've done, that may not be the best idea. 
 I'm still trying to wrap my head around all this. 
 Which part? Curing your incurable cancer, or figuring out what to do with the next thousand years? 
 Sorry. It's not funny. 
 No, it kind of is. 
 I'm really grateful to you for saving my life. 
 And there's something to be said for never having a cold again, or getting to work in the hot lab without gloves. 
 Not to mention looking like you're 26 forever. 
 Seriously? That's how this works? 
 I can understand it on a cellular level, but Hatake telling me he was born in 1501? 
 That makes him 513. 
 And doesn't look a day over 500. 
 (laughing) 
 All I've ever wanted was to make my mark on the world. 
 You know? Put my name on something that really changed people's lives. 
 And I know that this may sound naive, but I feel like with enough time we can do anything. 
 It's a lot of options to consider. 
 I know. 
 People don't like what they don't understand. 
 We're gonna have to hide what we are, not just from Ilaria but the rest of the world. 
 Everyone around us will eventually die. 
 Friends, family... 
 I don't know if I can handle that. 
 Let's hope we get the chance. The next 12 hours, Ilaria is gonna try and wipe this base off the face of the earth with us inside. 
 We made good time today. 
 Nearly 40km. We rest here. 
 At dawn, split into smaller groups to hide our numbers. 
 Take off in four-hour intervals, maintain radio silence, then we'll meet at the rendezvous in Nunavut. 
 Speaks like he's one of us. We all just fall in line, no questions? 
 He may not be one of us, but he's a born leader with tactical skills we need. 
 I don't think it's his tactics you're admiring. 
 I'm not blind to his faults. 
 But he knows the Ilaria Corporation and her methods. 
 That's 'cause he's one of them. He's a hired gun! 
 He doesn't have any loyalties. 
 He saved my life. He saved our people. 
 You really think we're that special to him? 
 In a couple days out on the ice, we're gonna make him forget who he really is? 
 No. But I trust him. 
 And what if you're wrong? 
 Then I'll gut the son of a bitch myself. 
 ♪ (happy instrumental music) 
 I got something. From six hours ago. 
 My god, he's young. His name is Spencer Chissik, but he prefers the name of his weapon of choice: a scythe. 
 And this child is responsible for all those people on the elevator? 
 Don't let his appearance deceive you. He has spent centuries perfecting the art of human suffering. 
 We would be foolish to underestimate him. 
 Well, we have one advantage: They will underestimate us. 
 Spencer : Where are they? 
 They're in Hatake's office. 
 It's too easy. 
 Why are they just walking around in the open like that? 
 Perhaps their curiosity got the best of them. 
 No, Hatake's too smart for that. 
 (banging) 
 Would someone please shut her up? 
 (container beeping) 
 (steady beeping) Oh, my god. 
 I... 
 What is it? 
 Security footage from four days ago. 
 It's Sutton. 
 Show me. 
 I'm so... 
 Show me. 
 (Sutton yelling) 
 (Sutton choking) 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I will avenge my mother. 
 (Sutton choking) 
 I think you should hear this. 
 Our friends are about to lead us to what we came for. 
 It will never work. 
 Why not? It looks like there's only three of them. Even the remaining vectors have more sense than you. They are hiding, as we should be. Is that true? No sign of them anywhere. We are in this situation because you brought NARVIK back to the base. Without the NARVIK, there wouldn't be a cure. Now we have both. Ilaria has invested tens of millions. They will not allow NARVIK or the cure to be destroyed. Well, it's a good thing we're not asking their permission. Here's the plan: Daniel, you'll create a base-wide diversion. Hatake and I will go after and retrieve the virus and the cure. And then it's a race to the incinerator. Agreed. It's a bold plan, but it should work. Hiroshi. Taking orders in your own home. I almost feel sorry for him. What do you want us to do? Suit up. Let's finish what my mother started. You and I need to talk. Good idea. Let's wait until Nunavut, where it's warmer. I want you to stay away from my sister. Why not ask her about that? She won't listen to me. What makes you think I will? My sister thinks she can change you. But you and I, we know the truth. Yeah? What's that? That you don't give a sh1t about anybody but yourself. Yep. I'm out here risking my life because I enjoy the scenery. You're doing this for Anana? Because you care? What does it matter why I do this? Because you're gonna hurt her. Maybe not tomorrow. But you will. Maybe she wants to get hurt. Maybe you should get on that snowmobile and keep riding! You know, you kind of remind me of someone. If you truly care about her, you'll go. Can you hand me a torque wrench and a 3/8 socket? It's the one that looks like, uh... Heh. Thank you. You really think Alan's plan's gonna work? You think they were watching us? I'm sure they were. I never thought I'd be wishing I was back in Bolivia. Bolivia. Capital is Sucre. Major export: Petroleum gas. You've been? No.  Encyclopedia Brittanica. Hatake gave me one for my 7th birthday. You grew up here? Yeah. Never left. Not even to travel? I never left because... I believed in Hatake and his work. I thought I was somehow part of it, but it turns out everything he did was for you. Daniel, I... It's not your fault. I chose to stay. And when all this is done, I'm gone. If we get out of this, I just want you to know you can treat me like a sister. Thank you. But I already have one. We need to get going. (snowcat beeping) You risk too much. Spencer is centuries old, an expert in tactics. I'd rather go on the offensive than sit around waiting to die. You're impetuous like your brother. Don't bring him into this. I've met many men like you. They are only able to see what is now, not what is coming over the horizon. And you're so consumed with the long view, you can't see what's right in front of you. I have dedicated many lifetimes trying to engineer the virus, to give humanity the greatest gift. Immortality. Even if it were true, how is that your gift to give? An end to suffering, disease, war, and death. We will change the world. Gunnar suffered, went insane, killed himself. You murdered Sutton. How has your immortality improved your humanity at all? You do not understand. System voice :  Biohazard. Biohazard. There's the diversion. Let's get the virus. Stay where you are! Put your hands where I can see them. Hiroshi. Spencer. Don't ever call me that. You know what I want. I only know you are as foolish now as when we first met: A 15-year old still clinging to his mother's skirts. Yes, my poor mother. You will answer to the board for her. But first, my virus. Come and get it. (gunshots) What happened? Did the trap work? We got one of them. Spencer is still alive. Well, it's one less we have to deal with. The other two are meaningless. We had our chance. We will not have another. We can't stand around discussing this. We need to get back to the cabin. We're just gonna hide? We have the virus, cure, enough food to wait them out. If Spencer's anything like Sutton, I'll take my chances in the cabin. It's settled. We go downstairs. No more traps. I can't believe Thea would fall for that. She was reckless. She underestimated Hatake, as did my mother. Why allow Hatake into her room in the first place? Speak clearly. What threw Sutton off? Why didn't she just kill him? Yet you were willing to throw it all away. For what? This abomination? Was it worth it? Chasing the Willis Hypotsis to protect your daughter? Your daughter? I mean, how? That's impossible. What's the Willis Hypothesis? The ravings of a madman, one who can no longer be allowed to propagate his insane ideals. Listen to me, Blake, my love. I have a very important job for you. I need you to figure out everything you can about that daughter. Now. 
 
 (tropical music playing in elevator) System voice :  Level B. It's almost over, Jules. I wish I believed that. Level C. So do I. It felt... good to say it, anyway. (thud) (elevator powering down) What was that? Breaker must have tripped. Happens about once a month. You sure that's all it is? System voice :  Service error. Service error. Hey. Something's wrong. They should be back by now. I know. Well, we should go look for them. No one in, no one out. That's what Alan said. Oh, wow, don't quote Alan's rules back to me. I had enough of that growing up. Has he always been such a stickler? Are you kidding? We got in a fight once because I pulled one of those tags off a pillow. I'm sure they'll be back soon. And if not? What then? Alan will be back. How do you know? Because I know. You really care for him, don't you? I do. He's my mentor. Your mentor. So that's why you came up here even though you're sick? I came up here because it's my job. Right. Why did you come up here? To run away after you slept with Julia? I slept with Julia because I loved her. System voice :  Service error. (tropical music playing) Where's Julia? System voice :  Level D. Man : She was right next to me. How the hell did she get out? He has her. Well, then we have to go back upstairs. No. He knows she is my daughter. We must follow Spencer's rules now. What, and leave her up there with that lunatic? Of course not. They will only inflict more pain. We must wait. I have to go back up. We can't just sit around waiting for some list of demands. I told you. We must not provoke him further. I don't want to provoke him. I want to rip his head off. As do I. But that is what he wants. To unbalance us. He's succeeding. Be patient, then. Spencer will come when he's ready. (knocking) "To the traitor Hiroshi." Everybody just quiet! Move aside. This is exactly what The Scythe wants. You once told me, to react in anger is to act against yourself. That was before my daughter's safety was threatened. Perhaps one day, when you have a family of your own... I thought I did. You cannot stop me. Maybe not. But I can slow you down. Stop it! Stop it! We're playing right into his hands. Are you telling me you would not sacrifice your own life for Julia? Of course I would, unless there were any other way. What did the note say again? "She has nine more fingers, but I only had one mother. Come directly to Isolation. The longer you wait, the less of your daughter will be left." This is between Spencer and me. I will go to him. Alone. That's suicide. There is no other way. He's right. He has to go alone or Julia dies. She's dead either way. You think he's just gonna let her walk out of there? No, but I'll be damned if I'm letting that... that boy do any more harm to her. What did you do?! What did I do when? Stop it! Not until you tell me what you said to Sergio! I didn't say anything. Don't you lie to me! Qamut saw you two talking last night. I was only looking out for you. Who asked you to? He's not one of us. He is not one of anybody! He was helping us, you idiot! Stop, Anana! People don't change! He would've turned on us! You're wrong about him! You and Miksa both! The halothane gas system is confined to the ducts by a series of metal louvers. If we can divert the gas, we could knock them all out and get Dr. Walker back. The louvers will need to be reset manually, which means somebody will need to go back up into the ducts. I've been up there. I'll go. I'll go with you. No, no, Peter, you are still recovering. I'm fine. Besides, who knows his way around those ducts better than me? You're willing to give up everything for Julia? Even your own life? Yes, of course. She's my daughter. And if it were your son? You know the answer. And yet you built this place for a daughter, and then lied to your son about it. Daniel... Miksa, I... You don't need to explain. She's your blood. You've been a good son. I wish I could have been a better father. Uh-uh-uh-uh. I would not do that if I were you. Mercury sensors are attached to the trigger mechanism. Any sudden movement, and the device will go off. What is this thing? Simple explosive fitted to a collar. A little trick I picked up from the Colombians. Why? See, your father... He's quite fond of separating people from their heads. I figured I'd return the favor. You're worried about him. I'm worried about all of us. If it was my father... He's not my real father. He's the man who stole me from my family. What kind of a monster does something like that? The same man who's out there right now risking his life for Julia. That doesn't excuse what he did. No, it doesn't. But I'm sure he would do the same for you. You sound like you're on his side. I'm not taking any sides. But even monsters have their reasons. There's a T-intersection up ahead, and that's where the louvers are. No, I don't think so. It's a dead end up there. You want to lead? Hey, I've spent a lot more time up here than you. Well, you should have thought of that before we got in here. This reminds me of hiding in the attic when the old man was on one of his benders. Well, that was usually me hiding. You were more often in the line of fire. I did have a knack for getting in his way. You're right, it's a dead end. Told ya. In case you're interested, T-intersection's down here. I guess you did spend some time up here. I was, uh... infected. I... I don't really remember this. Uh-huh. Hatake. Are you in position? Almost there. Yes, it's cramped, yes, we're hungry, and we could probably all use a hot shower. If you want to take your chances out there, go right ahead. Otherwise, please be patient. We're not the enemy. Daniel... Daniel. Daniel? I have what you want. (grunting with effort) It feels like it hasn't been opened in years. Dad may have been an angry prick, but he was right about one thing: Always bring WD-40. Here, let's... try it from the bottom. I think we'll get better leverage up here. What are you doing? Come on. Hey. Just because it's not your way doesn't make it the wrong way. You never listen. Are you kidding? That's all I do. You never take me seriously. That is not true. Yeah? Then let's try it my way. From the top. Hatake, the last of the vents is open, and we're ready for the gas. Do you hear me? Do you copy me? The vent is open and we're ready for the halothane gas. Dr. Hatake, can you read me? What's he waiting for? Hatake? Do you read me? I repeat: The vent is open. We're ready for the gas. Spencer. Hiroshi. Took you long enough. I was just about to go in there and slice off another piece of your daughter. Just 20 seconds shy. Thank you. You can run along now. Go check on our friend. Let Julia go, and you can do with me as you please. I will not fight you. That's very generous of you. Sacrificing yourself for a loved one. There's nothing quite like a bond between a parent and a child. I know that now, since you took my mother from me. My life... for hers. I'm begging you. It doesn't quite look like you're begging. Try again, but this time on your knees. Please. Let my daughter live. (Spencer chuckling) You know, I never thought I'd see the day. But it's just the beginning. Behind the glass, your daughter. But wait. Daniel. This is barbaric... even by your standards. You will answer to the board! Where was your concern for the board when you killed my mother? She would have killed me. Only had you let her. And it would have spared you the decision you now have to make. What do you want? The virus? I already have the virus. What I want is for you to make a choice. One lives, and one dies. It's completely up to you. I refuse to play your sick game. I think you will, 'cause, see, if you fail to choose... I kill both of them. Oh, and what fun is a game if it's not against the clock? So, who will it be? The miracle that is your biological daughter, or your loyal son who dedicated his life to you? You will kill them both. I will not. One of them loses their head, and one of them goes free. That is a promise. No. I cannot. You will. I will not! Say goodbye to your children, then, Hiroshi... Stop. You don't have to choose. Daniel. There is no decision to make. Daniel, please. Don't do anything foolish. I love, you, Father. I always will. And I forgive you. Daniel! Daniel. Did that make you feel powerful? No, but this does. (computers beeping) Mom?
