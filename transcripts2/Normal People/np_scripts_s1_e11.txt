 Is this all you been doing all day? 
 Cleaned the house. You wouldn't know. 
 This is your thing again now you're back from Sweden? 
 So this is your thing again now, is it? 
 What? Just lazing around. 
 It's the summer holidays. 
 You're pathetic. 
 Really f*cking pathetic. 
 He'll say, "You think I'm such a horrible person". 
 Right. 
 "I try to be nice to you and you always throw it back at me". 
 And does he? 
 What? 
 Try to be nice to you. 
 No. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Do you know how often you've been back here since I came home? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 Don't know, just... you don't have to. That's all. 
 Well, it's really the only thing I have to look forward to, so... 
 ♪ I need you to breathe again ♪ 
 ♪ You have been hurting so much ♪ 
 ♪ I need you to breathe again ♪ 
 Against Fermanagh, it's a great catch, to get it is Brian. 
 Brilliantly done. His reading of the game is exquisite for a player who's so young. 
 Dean Rock. Stumble and fumble here this time, on the part of Brian Fenton. 
 And a lot of pressure coming on Shaun Patton's kick outs. 
 We've seen earlier in the game the two short ones that were intercepted. He's going long now and Dublin are doing extremely well on their long kick outs. 
 You falling asleep? 
 No. 
 I can run you back at halftime if you want. 
 Am I in your way? 
 Not at all, you just seemed pretty sleepy. 
 Where did you disappear to last night? 
 Uh... 
 I don't know, I was in the smoking area for a bit. 
 Did you end up kissing that girl? 
 No. 
 I'm really warm. 
 Do you find it hot in here? 
 No, but you can open up the windows there if you want. 
 Ah, Eric was looking for you last night, actually. 
 Did you see him? Yeah, I saw him. 
 It's weird. 
 For some reason he wanted to apologize to me. 
 For the way he acted in school. Really? 
 Did you accept the apology? 
 Course I did. 
 Don't go in for grudges. 
 Luckily for me. 
 Do you want an ice cream? 
 Sure. Right, back in a sec. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 How are you, could I get two rockets please? 
 Two rockets. Thanks. 
 Thank you very much, cheers. Cheers, thank you. 
 It's nice Eric apologized to you. 
 I know, people from school have actually been really nice since I got back. 
 Though I never make any effort to see them. 
 Maybe you should. 
 Why? You think I'm being ungrateful? 
 No, I just mean, like... it must be kind of lonely for you. 
 I'm used to it. 
 Been lonely my whole life, really. 
 Yeah, I know what you mean. 
 You weren't lonely when you were with Helen. 
 Were you? 
 I don't know. Sometimes. 
 Mm. 
 Didn't feel totally myself with her all the time. 
 Connell. Mm-hmm. 
 You know when we were dancing last night. 
 Yeah. 
 Mm, what about it? 
 Did I do something to annoy you? 
 Why do you say that? 
 Well, when you walked away and just left me there, felt kind of awkward. 
 I thought maybe you were annoyed with me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I wasn't. 
 I, um... 
 I feel like, uh... our friendship would be a lot easier if like... uh, certain things were different. 
 If what was different? 
 I don't know, I um, things would be a lot less confusing if there weren't like this... other element of the relationship. 
 When we were together in the first year of college, were you lonely then? 
 No. 
 You? 
 No. 
 I was frustrated sometimes, but not lonely. 
 I'm never lonely when I'm with you. 
 Yeah. 
 That was kind of a perfect time in my life, to be honest. 
 I don't think I was ever really happy before then. 
 I really wanted you to kiss me last night. 
 Oh. 
 I wanted to kiss you as well, I guess. Uh... 
 I guess we just misunderstood each other. 
 That's okay. 
 Look, I, uh, I don't know what the best thing for us to do is, like, obviously. 
 It's nice for me to hear you say that stuff, but like... 
 At the same time, things haven't worked out well for us in the past, like... 
 You know? 
 You are my best friend, and I don't... don't want to lose that for any reason. 
 Yeah. 
 I know what you mean. 
 And I don't want you to think that I'm... not being appreciative or anything because I think you have been... so supportive of me what with the depression and everything. 
 And I'm not lingering on that too much, but... you really have been a big help with that. 
 You don't owe me anything. 
 No, I know that. I didn't mean that. 
 Look, I... I'm just getting anxious now. 
 I don't want you to think like I'm rejecting you or anything. 
 Don't be anxious. Everything's fine. 
 Think I might head home now if that's okay. 
 I'll drop you. No. 
 You don't want to miss the second half. I'll walk. 
 I forgot there was a match on, to be honest. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 That's nice. 
 I'm just really nervous. 
 I think it's pretty obvious I don't want you to leave. 
 I don't find it obvious what you want. 
 I want this so much. 
 It's really nice to hear you say that. 
 I've missed you. 
 It's not like this with other people. 
 I know, but I like you a lot more than other people. 
 Yeah. 
 I actually don't have any condoms. 
 That's okay. I'm on the pill. 
 Do you want it like this? 
 However you want. 
 I haven't done this in a while, so... 
 It's okay. 
 Marianne, can we... can we do this, like, next weekend? 
 Whenever you want. 
 Whenever I want, really? 
 You can do whatever you want with me. 
 Ah, that's nice. 
 Do you like hearing me say that? 
 Yeah, a lot. 
 Will you tell me I belong to you? 
 What do you mean? 
 Will you hit me? 
 No, I, uh... 
 
 
 
 I don't think I want that. 
 Is that, is that okay? 
 Do you want, do you want to stop? 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm, uh... 
 I'm sorry, I just didn't, I didn't, uh, want to do that. 
 I just, I... 
 I just, I just think it'd be weird. 
 Er, uh, no, not weird. I just... 
 I don't think that'd be a good idea. 
 You think I'm weird. 
 No, I didn't say that. I just mean I'm... 
 I don't know, I just don't want it to be weird between us. 
 I think I'd better go home now, if that's okay. 
 Uh, yeah. Yeah, if that's what you want. 
 Um... 
 Listen, let me drive you home at least, then. 
 No, I, I want to walk a bit. 
 Marianne! 
 Where the f*ck were you? 
 Connell's house. 
 You shouldn't be going over there. 
 I thought you liked him. 
 You did when we were in school. Yeah. 
 How was I supposed to know he's f*cked in the head? 
 I suppose you'll have to ask him. 
 I don't want people going around town saying a knacker is riding my sister. 
 Can I go now, please? 
 I don't want you to go near him again. 
 I'm warning you now. 
 People are talking about you. 
 I can't imagine what my life would be like if I cared what people thought... 
 Come back here. Marianne! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 I'm really sorry about this. 
 I-I feel like an idiot. 
 Yeah, uh, about earlier, um... 
 I was thinking about it as well. 
 No, I, I, it's not that. 
 It's, it's really stupid. I just, I, I tripped or something and I-I've hurt myself. 
 I'm sorry to call you. It's, it's, it's nothing. 
 I just, I don't know what to do. 
 Where are you? I'm at home. 
 It's, it's not serious. It, it just hurts that's all. 
 Okay, I'm on my way now. I'm getting in the car, okay? 
 Okay. 
 What's happened? 
 Why have you got blood on you? I think my nose is broken. 
 Yeah. 
 Was it him? 
 Okay. Uh... 
 Uh, get in the car. 
 Go. 
 What's going on here? 
 I didn't do anything. 
 Huh? If you ever touch Marianne again, I'll kill you. 
 Say one bad word to her ever again and I'll come back here myself and I'll kill you. 
 That's it. 
 Do you understand me? Yes. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry to bother you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't know what to do. 
 No, don't say sorry. 
 It's good that you called me, okay? 
 Look at me a second. 
 No one is ever gonna hurt you like that again. 
 Everything's gonna be all right, trust me. 
 'Cause I love you, and I'm not gonna let anything like that happen to you again. 
 Thank you.
