 It's a simple game. 
 You have 15 players. Give one of them the ball, get it into the net. 
 Very simple. Isn't it? 
 Oh, what? Oh. 
 Brilliant. 
 How's it going, Rachel? 
 Talking tactics, there, for the game. 
 We're getting a master class. 
 How incredibly boring of you. Yeah. 
 Did you get your hair done? I did, yeah. 
 It's very pretty. Thanks. 
 Can I use my locker, by any chance? Yeah. 
 Yeah, I sort of need you to move, Connell. 
 Oh, sorry. Excuse me. 
 "Uh, sorry. Ex-squeeze me". All right, relax, will ya? 
 But you know that's important. 
 Because it's turned up in the exam twice out of the last three years. 
 Marianne? 
 Yeah? 
 Something outside caught your attention? 
 I suppose so. 
 Eyes forward, okay? 
 I wasn't aware my eye line fell under the jurisdiction of school rules. 
 Here we go. Jesus. 
 Trying to impress your classmates? 
 They don't look too impressed to me. 
 I'm pretty sure I was just looking out the window. 
 Come on, Sheridan. 
 If you're staring out the window daydreaming, then you're not learning, are you, Marianne? 
 Don't hurt yourself. 
 I have nothing to learn from you. 
 Okay, in that case, principal's office. 
 Yeah. I might go there. 
 Or I might just head home. 
 It's not really your business what I do, is it? 
 Don't worry, sir. She's a psycho to everybody. 
 Do you want to follow her, Folan? 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Come on in. Your mum's in the kitchen. 
 Hey, love. 
 Marianne was telling me you got your mock results back today. 
 Uh, just English. 
 They come back separately. 
 I hear you did very well. 
 He did. Yeah, well... 
 Marianne did pretty good, too. 
 Can we go? 
 Didn't realize we were in a rush. 
 Just put these away, and then we'll be off. 
 Immediately, okay? Mm-hmm. 
 Do you want some? N-no thanks. 
 Didn't you get French back today? Yesterday. 
 Yeah. 
 Got an A1. 
 What'd you get in German? 
 Are you bragging? 
 Got an A1. 
 Ah, you're gonna get 600, are ya? 
 You probably will. 
 Yeah, well, you're smarter than me, so... 
 Smarter than everyone. 
 Ah, well, you're not top of the class in English. 
 Maybe you should give me grinds, Connell. 
 Good to go? Yeah. 
 Oy. 
 Thanks for everything, Lorraine. 
 Tell your mum I'll clean upstairs tomorrow. 
 Did you rob the place? 
 What? 
 The quick getaway. 
 You could have said goodbye. I did. 
 She doesn't exactly have an easy time of it, Connell. 
 You could try being a bit nicer to her. 
 I am nice to her. 
 She's actually a very sensitive person. 
 Oh, look. Can we talk about something else, please? 
 You enjoying your book there, Marianne? 
 I said, are you enjoying your book? 
 You're not getting distracted by the f*ckin' window, are you? 
 That is absolutely tragic. 
 That's it, that's it, Connell. That's it. 
 Right. Let's focus it. Yeah. Here. 
 Beautiful. Keep it going, boys. Fast, fast, fast. 
 Sorry. Am I disturbing you, Marianne? 
 No. 
 If I knew what I wanted to study, I'd obviously tell you. 
 Well, you must have some idea. 
 No. I know what I don't want to study, but that's about it. 
 Jesus, how long is that list? 
 Fairly long. 
 That's a great way to decide, Connell. 
 Rule out marine biology and astrophysics, and all the rest till you're left with one. 
 I could be a marine biologist. 
 Yeah, that sounds like your area of interest, all right. 
 You've not got long. Forms are due soon. 
 Yeah. I'm aware. 
 Is this just out? 
 About five minutes ago. 
 Made some salad. 
 Could you not have drawn the curtains, Marianne? 
 It's literally only just getting dark. 
 You've got the heating on full and the curtains wide open. 
 Did you have a good day? 
 Depends on what you mean by good. 
 You can get rid of one client and another one arrives. 
 Isn't that good business? 
 Yes. 
 Where's your brother? 
 Don't shrug, Marianne. 
 I don't know. I haven't seen him. 
 And how was school? Okay. 
 Got some results back. 
 Mocks. And? 
 Good. 
 Good. 
 Is there any food? 
 Your sister's reheated a lasagna. 
 Oh, good effort, Marianne. 
 How was your day? All right. 
 Not too busy. 
 You out this evening? 
 Yeah. 
 'Cause I got this thing called a social life. 
 Right. 
 You know, like, actual friends. 
 Lucky you. 
 Fermanagh now completing the list of qualifiers. 
 Draw for the next round will be held on Thursday. 
 Finally, at the Cricket World Cup today, it's the semi-final clash, as India... 
 Hello? Alan, it's Ger. How's it going? 
 Good, yeah. Uh, listen, I'm after missing the bus, and I hate to ask you, but any chance of a lift in? 
 Yeah, no bother at all, man. You at the house, eh? 
 I'll swing around for you now. Oh, thank you so much. 
 Sound. Stall it there. I'll see you in a few. Yeah, you're a star. 
 What are you doing? 
 Uh, did you not hear that entire call? 
 I have to go pick up Ger out in Garryduff. 
 You hop out here. 
 Are you serious? I'll get drenched. 
 Right. sh1t buzz for you, pal. 
 Maybe you should learn to drive. 
 Go on. 
 "It was sliding beneath the big, black wave. 
 Another and another. 
 Then I was back in it. The war was..." 
 Class begins at nine, Marianne. 
 Yeah. Thanks for that. 
 Excuse me? 
 Can you just give me a detention and move on? 
 Quiet. 
 "Then I was back in it. 
 The war was on outside, in Worcester, Massachusetts..." 
 I'm having people over Friday, after the match. 
 Come celebrate, or drown your sorrows. 
 Whatever. 
 Yeah. Sounds good. 
 What happened to you this morning, Marianne? 
 You're looking a bit on the drowned rat side. 
 Thanks, yeah. It was raining. 
 You should have brought an umbrella. 
 Good advice. 
 You strip off in the toilets to dry yourself again? 
 Not this time. No. Why? 
 Would you like an invitation next time? 
 "Just give me detention, and move on". 
 That was a good one. Glad you enjoyed it. 
 The sh1t you get away with 'cause you're smart. 
 I understand you're at a disadvantage there, Rob. 
 f*ck off. 
 Hey. 
 You're not heading home, no? 
 I did actually get a detention. 
 Sorry. 
 Technically, I requested it. 
 You were fairly harsh on Kerrigan the other day, as well. 
 He's actually pretty decent. 
 I don't know why you had to have such a go at him. 
 I object to every thought or action, or... feeling of mine being policed like we're in some authoritarian fantasy. 
 Well, it's not that, though, is it? 
 It's just school. 
 It's the same for everybody. It's not unique for you. 
 You try to act like we're friends, but you know you're not that kind of person. 
 I'm not acting. 
 Maybe I am that kind of person. 
 Why are you talking to me, then? 
 Yeah. 
 What was Ms. Neary talking to you about after class? 
 Oh, don't know. Uh... getting out of class early for training or something. 
 She must find training highly amusing, then. 
 Well. 
 Does she fancy you or something? 
 Why'd you say that? 
 God, you're not having an affair with her, are you? 
 Please. You think it's funny joking about stuff like that, do you? 
 Sorry. People going at me like I fancy her. I... 
 I don't fancy her. 
 Well... maybe it's because you blush a lot when she talks to you. 
 Aah. 
 But you know, you blush at everything. 
 Thanks. 
 Guess you have one of those complexions. 
 Great. 
 You're blushing right now, actually. 
 Yeah. I'm aware. 
 Sorry. 
 I don't want to get into a fight with you or anything. 
 We're not fighting. 
 I know you... probably hate me. 
 But you're the only person who actually talks to me. 
 I never said that I hated you. 
 Well... 
 I like you. 
 Oh. 
 Got to head to training, so, uh... 
 Good luck at the match tomorrow. 
 Thanks. 
 Marianne, you gonna join us? 
 Come on, lads. In you go. 
 Keep going, keep going. 
 Come on, sink his ass! 
 
 
 
 f*ck! 
 Push through it, Kiernan! Come on! 
 Come on! Score! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 f*ck, we did it! 
 f*ck! 
 Come on! 
 Grand. Good lad. 
 Woo! 
 You're early. Come on in. 
 Have a bit do, yet. Grand. 
 Quick as I can. 
 No, not in there. 
 I've just finished mopping. 
 And well done, man of the match. 
 Marianne told me. 
 Did she? She did. 
 You played well today. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 That's nice of you. 
 I can be nice. I know you can. 
 You know, the way you are in school, I don't think you're like that, really. 
 What am I like, really? 
 Ah. 
 You can borrow it, if you like. 
 Oh, I... I actually read it already. 
 I don't know why I picked it up. 
 Any good? Yeah. I liked it. 
 You... You'd like it, actually. 
 It's got a lot about feminism, and all that. 
 Do your friends know you read so much? 
 Yeah, they wouldn't really be interested in all that stuff. 
 You mean they're not interested in the world around them? 
 Eh, not in the same way that we would be, but they have their own interests, I suppose. 
 Right. Like, uh, bragging about who they're having s*x with. 
 Yeah. They can do a bit of that. 
 I'm... I'm not defending it. 
 Doesn't it bother you? 
 Most of it wouldn't. 
 And then they do some stuff that's a bit over the line, and that would bother me, obviously, but... they're my friends at the end of the day. It's different for you. 
 Why is it different? 
 You know, um... 
 You were saying the other day that you like me. 
 B-by the photocopier, you said it. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Did you mean "like" as... a friend, or what? 
 No. 
 Not just as a friend. Yeah. 
 I thought that might be implied. I just... wasn't sure. 
 See, I'm... just a little confused about what I feel, I think. 
 Uh, it'd be awkward in school if something happened with us. 
 No one would have to know. 
 That was nice. 
 What, what are you laughing for? 
 Nothing. 
 Well, you're acting like you've never been kissed before. 
 I haven't. 
 Connell. Uh... 
 Don't tell anybody in school about this, all right? 
 Like I talk to anyone at school. 
 Yeah, I'll pop in for a bit. See ya in there. 
 Yeah, busy. Yeah. See you inside, all right? 
 All right? 
 How's things, boss? Keeping well, yeah? 
 All right. Thanks. 
 Come here to me. Fair play to ya. 
 Man of the hour! Ah, no, not really. 
 Thought you'd change your mind. 
 Oh. Well, I'm glad you're here. 
 Shots. 
 Go on, get that into ya. Cheers. All right. 
 Cheers! 
 Cheers! 
 How's the craic, Waldron? All right. 
 You were on form on Friday. 
 So you were feelin' it, were you? 
 He was almost as drunk as Rachel. 
 f*ck off, Rob. You passed out in a hedge. 
 That, I did. It was a good night. 
 From what I can remember. It was a good night. 
 Hey. All right. 
 Waldron? Yeah. 
 Have you got that French homework, there? 
 Yeah, I do. Yeah. Can I get it off you before break? 
 Give it to you now. I have it handy. 
 You're a lifesaver, man. 
 Throw it back to me, yeah? Yeah. 
 Hiya. 
 Your mum's not here. Yeah, um... 
 Can I come in? 
 Thanks. 
 You're not busy or anything, no? 
 No, I'm just... 
 Are you going to start kissing me again? 
 Can we take our clothes off? 
 No. 
 Not here. It's... 
 Uh... 
 Uh... 
 Got a free house on Saturday. 
 You could come over then, if you wanted to. 
 Will anyone else be there? 
 No. 
 Are you sure we can't take our clothes off? 
 Oh, no. Yeah. 
 I said I'd take Lorraine to the shops, and this is, uh... 
 You were tempted, though, for a second. 
 Not really. 
 You were tempted. 
 I tempted you. 
 So you'll come on Saturday?
