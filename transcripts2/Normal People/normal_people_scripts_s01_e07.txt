 Aah. 
 It's like f*cking school again. We got so wrecked. 
 Should have come. It was a good night. 
 Proper laugh. 
 _ 
 Uh, so look, I, um... 
 I am not gonna be here for the summer. 
 Yeah. 
 Like, I can't pay the rent. 
 Yeah. 
 And Niall's gonna sublet the room, so... 
 I'll have to move out. 
 When? 
 Uh, pretty soon. Next week, maybe. 
 So you'll be going back to Sligo, then. 
 I mean, um... 
 I guess... 
 I guess you want to see other people, or, uh... 
 I guess so. Yeah. 
 Connell Waldron. Ah, Ms. Neary. 
 Oh, my God. Would ya not call me that? 
 Haven't seen you since school. 
 Ah, it's weird seeing ya. 
 Good weird. Mm. 
 Ooh. 
 You're so f*cking hard. 
 What? 
 Do you wanna come back to my place? 
 Oh... 
 I'm gonna be sick. 
 What? Uh... mm. 
 Hey, um... 
 I should go. 
 So I guess we should see other people. 
 I guess so. 
 You didn't tell me you were in town. 
 Yeah. 
 I got your text... when you were home. Feels a bit weird running into you with no warning or anything. Warning? 
 You know what I mean. 
 I'm just back for the weekend. 
 It's my father's anniversary mass. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Can I come? 
 Obviously, if you don't want me to I won't, but I'd like to. 
 Sorry. No? 
 Okay. 
 You're with Jamie now, I hear. 
 He always liked ya. 
 What about you? 
 You seeing anyone? No. 
 Not at the minute. 
 Embracing the single lifestyle? Yeah. 
 Yeah, you know me. 
 I did once. 
 Look, if you don't want to be friends, that's fine. 
 I'd just rather know, so we can... 
 Course I want to be friends. 
 Okay. 
 Do you want to come in? 
 For, like, a tea, or... 
 I can't. I've got shopping in the back. 
 Thanks for the lift. 
 Length of days is not what makes age honorable, nor number of years the true measure of life. 
 Understanding. 
 This is man's gray hairs. 
 Untarnished life. 
 This is ripe old age. 
 He has sought to please God, so God has loved him. 
 As he was living among sinners, he has been taken up. 
 He has been carried off so that evil may not warp his understanding, or treachery seduce his soul. 
 For the fascination of evil throws good things into the shade. 
 You didn't need to run. 
 Ah, my bus got caught in traffic. 
 Some protest. 
 Got you a coffee. 
 Ah, thanks. 
 How are you feeling about Schols? 
 How are you feeling about them, Connell? 
 Hmm. How am I feeling about my entire future being potentially secure, or... mind-numbingly difficult? Yeah, it's, ah... 
 ... casual. 
 How's Jamie? 
 Be nice if you guys could actually be civil. 
 Ah. I'm civil. Oh. 
 You could just, like, uh, try not to intimidate him quite so much. 
 Are you telling him not to intimidate me? 
 As if, Connell. 
 He's barely my height. Ah. 
 I'm not sure intimidation is strictly limited to height, though. No? 
 From where he's standing, you're the tall guy who used to f*ck his girlfriend. 
 Right. 
 Is that how you describe me to all your friends? 
 The tall guy who f*cked you? 
 Pretty sure we f*cked each other. 
 We had mutual, equally involved kind of s*x. 
 It's different. 
 With Jamie. 
 What do you mean? 
 Do you want to hear about this? 
 He's into pain. 
 Like, inflicting it. 
 Turns out he's a bit of a sadist. 
 Are you serious? 
 Just during s*x, that is. Not arguments. 
 Your face. 
 And you're, you're into that, are ya? 
 Yeah. 
 You're so shocked. 
 We really don't have to talk about this. 
 What does he do to ya, specifically? 
 Slaps me. Uses a belt. 
 Things like that. 
 Right. 
 Sounds f*cking horrible. 
 It's not. 
 It's just different. 
 You never said any of this to me when we were... 
 Well, it was different with you. 
 Things were different. 
 Right. 
 Didn't have to play any games with you. 
 It was just real. 
 With Jamie, I don't know. 
 It's a bit like I'm acting a part. 
 I just pretend to feel a certain way. 
 Like I'm in his power. 
 But with you, I actually had those feelings. 
 I'd have done anything you wanted me to. 
 Anyway... 
 How are you? 
 _ 
 The English scholars are... 
 Marion Pickard... 
 David Sexton... 
 Ashley Tobin... 
 Connell Waldron... 
 f*cking yes, mate. 
 f*cking right, you absolute f*cking nerd. 
 f*cking five years free tuition, free accommodation. 
 Five years, you jammy fucker! Unreal, man. 
 And Mairead Button... 
 The history and politics scholar is... 
 Marianne Sheridan. 
 Aah! 
 Traveling from west to east is literally like crossing a border into a completely different city, it's totally surreal. 
 I mean, I've been, so, I, uh... 
 Yeah, because everyone has been to f*cking Berlin, Peggy. 
 You're making out like you just got back from Syria. 
 Marianne's not been to Berlin. I'm explaining for her benefit. 
 They don't let people from Connacht travel that far. 
 Ooh. 
 Extremely hilarious. Marianne has been to Berlin. 
 Does anyone want more food? Yeah, it's so good. 
 Joanna cooked it. Yeah, I can make, like, one thing. 
 Anyway, should we do, uh, a f*ckin' toast or something to the cleverest history and politics student Trinity has ever known? 
 Hear, hear. Stop it. 
 Don't mind f*ckin' me. Ooh, we won't. 
 Poor Peggy. It's fine. I never studied. 
 To Marianne. 
 To Marianne. To Marianne. 
 To the cleverest girl in Trinity. 
 Jesus, stop it, please. 
 Thank God. 
 Eat up. 
 Hello? 
 Oh. Hi. 
 What? Are you okay? 
 Where are you? 
 Jesus Christ, Connell. 
 I know, it's fine. It's, uh... It's not as bad as it looks. 
 Thank you. Thanks. 
 What happened? Uh, just this lad. 
 Asked for my wallet. 
 I should have handed it over, but I said no, and he hit me in the face. 
 I'm fine. 
 Your phone number was the only one I knew off by heart. 
 I'm really sorry. I'm really drunk. 
 How drunk? 
 Ah, well, I've been out since they announced Schols, so... 
 Right. Mm-hmm. 
 Do I still have pupils? 
 Just about. 
 They're huge. Mm. 
 They always get like that when I see you, anyways. 
 
 
 
 Aah. Mm. 
 Mm. You must be drunk. 
 How do you mean? 
 Jamie's downstairs. 
 Oh. 
 Uh... 
 Ah, maybe I'll just go back out and get punched in the face. 
 It really wasn't that bad. Connell. 
 Ah. 
 Ugh. f*cking lowlife scum. 
 What? 
 f*cking lowlife scum? 
 Well, that's quite the welcome, Jamie. 
 You know, uh, we can't, uh... 
 We can't all be the spawn of millionaires. 
 Yeah, well, I was talking about the dickhead who robbed you to buy drugs, obviously. Drugs? 
 Yeah. Well, he's hardly using your cash to buy loaves of bread for his kids. 
 Be up his nose or in a needle, won't it? 
 Looks pretty bad, Connell. You okay? 
 It's not as bad as it looks. 
 Okay, I mean, will we get going, or... 
 You're such a sweetheart, Peggy. 
 He just said he was fine. I am. Thanks. 
 I'll join you in a bit. Get this one cleaned up first. 
 They stop letting in at 12. 
 I'm pretty tired anyways. 
 You go. Call you tomorrow. 
 Right. 
 If you're sure? 
 Okay? 
 Thanks for dinner, mate. 
 Thanks, Marianne. Thank you. It was delicious. 
 And congratulations again, Marianne. 
 You, too, Connell. 
 Congrats, Connell. Thanks. 
 Feel better. Come on, you guys. 
 Connell. Jamie. 
 You could have a different boyfriend, you know. 
 I mean, guys are consistently falling in love with you, from what I hear. 
 Stop that. 
 Tea? 
 People love ya or hate ya. 
 Right. 
 You don't hate me. 
 No. 
 No, I'm immune to ya. 
 Because I knew you before, in school. 
 When I was ugly and pathetic? No. 
 You were never ugly or pathetic. 
 I'd rather literally anyone else, Marianne. 
 I'd rather the lad that mugged me was your boyfriend. 
 Why do you care? 
 Do you love him? 
 We don't talk about that, do we? 
 I thought that stuff was off-limits for us. 
 All right. Okay. 
 You know, I probably should have mentioned this before, but I've been seeing someone. 
 Been with her a while. Yeah. 
 Should have mentioned it before, but then again, I feel like we've hardly seen each other. 
 Barely spent any time together, and, uh... 
 Yeah, her name's Helen Brophy. 
 I don't know would you know her. She studies medicine. 
 Why were you trying to get me to break up with Jamie? 
 No, I'm not. 
 I'm not. I just want you to be happy is all. 
 'Cause you're such a good friend, is it? Yeah. 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. I, I mean, I... I, I think I... 
 Jesus. Marianne. 
 I feel awful. I'm sorry. I should have said it before. 
 I don't want to talk to you, Connell. Just leave. 
 Please, can you just go? Yeah. 
 Look, I'm, uh, really sorry to have to ask. 
 It's just, I, uh... 
 I can't get home. 
 Uh, uh... 
 Would I be able to borrow the money, like you said? 
 Oh, God. 
 Sorry. 
 I managed to forget you've been beaten up somehow. I... Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 Here. 
 Uh, thanks. 
 Um... 
 You know, uh... 
 I don't know what happened with us last summer. 
 Uh, like, when I had to go home and that. 
 See, I kind of hoped that I would have been able to stay here. 
 That you would have let me. 
 Yeah, I, I just, uh... I don't really know what happened between us, to be honest. 
 You said you wanted to see other people. 
 No. 
 I thought you were breaking up with me. 
 You never said anything about wanting to stay here. I... 
 That would have been... 
 Always. 
 Obviously. 
 Uh... 
 Right, well, I, I should go. I'm, uh... 
 Have a good night, Marianne.
