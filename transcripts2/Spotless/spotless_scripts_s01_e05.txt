 Previously on Spotless... 
 What kind of trouble are you in? 
 Some people died. 
 I'm under investigation, for soliciting and accepting payments, in return for the award of contracts. 
 I want you to make it look like suicide. 
 I acted in the common interest. 
 It can be a brave way out, suicide. 
 Bollocks. 
 If they've had any doubt, they wouldn't have allowed us to clean the scene. 
 Life's for f*cking living. 
 Drag your tools out of storage, and make wonderful things. 
 It's a shitty old dump. 
 But it's my shitty old dump. 
 Where are the drugs? 
 I tried to sell the drugs, to a guy called Nelson Clay. 
 Nelson Clay? 
 Who did that? 
 The guys, from St-Nazaire. 
 Swear you won't say anything. 
 Forget the lack of airs and graces. 
 It's been a long day. 
 I left Portugal at 4.30 this morning. 
 It's the alcohol that's keeping me going. 
 And where about in Portugal? 
 Loriga. 
 It's a little village in the mountains. 
 It's really hot in the summer. 
 Ski country in the winter, I'd... live there and bake bread, if I could. 
 I'll stick to beer. 
 A Frenchman who doesn't drink wine? 
 I drink wine just not tonight. 
 Are your kids bilingual? 
 No. 
 No, they probably should be, but, when they were growing up, we didn't speak much French in the house. 
 I always thought if I ever had kids, it'd be really nice for them to have two languages: you know, mom's language, and dad's language. 
 Little cultural citizens of the world. 
 But then I hooked up with Nelson, and... well, he's barely got any English. 
 Sonny married beneath herself. 
 Where are you from? 
 Not London. 
 Corby. 
 Old steel town in the middle of the country. 
 I'm a mick-mack. 
 I don't know what that is. 
 Half-Irish, half-Scottish. Second generation. 
 They all followed the heavy industry to England, and stayed. 
 It can be a difficult mix. 
 The Celt and the steel, and the displacement... hard to penetrate really. 
 Do you go back? 
 My brother and I, we were... put into care, as kids. 
 I didn't see him or years, but I eventually shipped down here when I was in my teens. 
 But Corby, I was born there, I wouldn't call it home. 
 Care can mess kids up. 
 Yeah it can. 
 My brother and I spent some years in care. 
 What? 
 What shall we toast? 
 How about... absent friends. 
 36 HOURS EARLIER You need a piss? 
 Really, you're making me nervous. 
 I can't sleep. 
 When I do, eventually, I just see his face right there, all the time. 
 Who are you talking about? 
 Victor! 
 I just keep on hearing his phone call over and over. 
 He was probably wasted. 
 The guy can't hold his liquor, you know. 
 Yeah, he's a friendly type of murdering necrophiliac. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Lay low. 
 I'm not sure we're good at that. 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing? 
 I work here. 
 Well, it's 6.30! 
 Yeah. 
 That's the time I start work. 
 Really? 
 Possible new contract. 
 Didn't want to tie up one of the vans. 
 Did you get a haircut? 
 No. 
 The city that never sleeps. 
 That's New York. 
 What's London? 
 London is The Big Smoke. 
 So, what's Paris? 
 An overpriced shithole near Disneyland. 
 Look at you making a joke. 
 You're evolving. 
 Hello, we're looking for Nelson Clay. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Battle wound. 
 You're such a loser. 
 I never lose. 
 Can you put the pens away, please? 
 Knife wound. 
 It needs stitches. 
 It needs a wash. 
 She's right. No knife wounds before school. 
 I'm practising, in case the French guys show up. 
 There are no French guys, darling. 
 Come on. 
 Where are we going? 
 You don't have to be such a dick, man. It's very rude. 
 I'm not in the mood to chat, lads. 
 So if you don't mind... 
 Taste this. 
 What are you getting? 
 Ah, um... 
 Tangy. 
 It's rose-hip. 
 There's your daily dose of vitamin C in that one cup. 
 See, I'm growing these old school traditional shrubs. 
 The new ones are bred, so they don't fruit. 
 People want everything sterile these days. 
 Are we here for a tea party? 
 I need your help. 
 Inside. 
 What are you reading? 
 Don't try to be my friend. It won't work. 
 He's been shot? 
 Right knee. 
 Well, I can't f*cking do this. This is way beyond me. 
 You need to get him to a hospital, he needs a doctor. 
 We're not here for that. 
 You're going to kill him? 
 Yeah. 
 This is my death scene, mate. 
 Joey will kill him. 
 You will clean it up. 
 It's just his leg. You can save him. 
 You don't understand the bigger picture? 
 What? And you do? 
 Boss. 
 Denny, put your weapon away. Get some air. 
 I'll let Frank fill you in himself. 
 Don't leave anything out now. 
 f*ck! 
 What did you do? 
 Got caught. 
 I don't suppose you carry any painkillers, do you? 
 No, sorry. 
 Ha! 
 Last one. 
 Was this the way out you talked about? 
 Yeah. 
 I, um... I was involved with a man named Veysel Kisa. 
 He's the real deal. 
 Turkish. 
 They were in Saint-Nazaire. 
 They're everywhere. 
 I sold Veysel some information. 
 It was good money. 
 Enough for this? 
 Maybe not. 
 Gotta go into London. 
 Let's finish this thing up. 
 He's not really going to kill you. 
 Yeah, he will. 
 And he'll kill you too. 
 When it suits him. 
 Not today, but you know... 
 Try not to overthink it... it's... it's just a fact. 
 Who's been smoking? Huh? 
 Sonny's got a nose like a beagle! 
 Let's not make this any more painful. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 You know I do! 
 Bullshit. 
 Just to be clear, this is business, all right? 
 It's not personal. There is no alternative. 
 He knew exactly the risk he was taking when he went squealing to those f*cking Turks! 
 You're finished. 
 This isn't part of the agreement. 
 I said no. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave you to get on with it. 
 I have some business in town. Joey will drive you back when you're finished. 
 f*ck you! I'm not cleaning this! 
 Joey can drive us back right now. 
 Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
 Your partner agrees with you? 
 Always. 
 It's been a tough morning. 
 I'll assume you're emotional. 
 I'm not an emotional man. 
 We're not cleaning up the murder you just committed. 
 And that's your decision? 
 This place will remain exactly as it is until these two change their minds. 
 Sonny comes back tomorrow, this place isn't as was, there will be consequences. 
 Joey, get the car. 
 Every rule I insisted on, he breaks: we're not there for crime, we don't know details of what sh1t has gone down, we control the scene. And... and now he's killing guys in front of us? 
 His own f*cking guy. 
 You don't have anything to say about this? 
 Yeah. I have something I want to contribute. 
 If you say no to Nelson Clay, we're gonna need new friends. 
 Well, even for you that would be very stupid. 
 I told you not to say that anymore, all right? 
 All right? 
 You're willing to put your family at risk because your pride is hurt? 
 It has nothing to do with my pride! 
 You got a pretty f*cking big hide. You know that? Do you know that? 
 Huh? 
 We gotta make it stop now, or we're f*cked! Permanently. 
 He will cut Oliver's balls before they grow peach fuzz. and he will let Maddy live, but he will ruin her! 
 How are you f*cking helping right now?! 
 How do you ever help? 
 You go back, you do the job, and you buy us time. 
 No. 
 I should rip your f*cking head off right now. 
 Well, anything you wanna try. 
 Go for it. 
 You okay? 
 I dropped 'em off in town. 
 So what happens if he doesn't do the clean? 
 He will. 
 He's just... overwhelmed. 
 Denny, go inside, check them out. 
 Jean Bastière needs to feel like he has some control. 
 But he doesn't. 
 He can always say no. 
 It's a powerful word. 
 And then what? 
 Stay here. 
 Clear your head. 
 My husband suffered some depression. Long-term unemployed. 
 Doctors got him on this dairy-free diet. 
 Trouble is, everything tastes like rubber. 
 Well, it could help I suppose. 
 Our bodies aren't designed to cope with all the processed rubbish on the shelves. 
 True. We try to stay clear of processed. 
 Except crisps. 
 Hm! 
 Couldn't live without crisps. 
 Jean, this is... um... 
 DCI Squire. 
 Diane Squire. 
 I hope you don't mind me popping by. 
 No. 
 Could we have a quick word? 
 Of course. Um... could you just give me 5 minutes? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 Could we have the room please? 
 He means "get out". 
 Thank you. 
 I'll go see a man about a horse. 
 Can I offer you a drink? 
 No, thanks. 
 Mind if I have one? 
 Not at all. 
 Thanks for seeing me. 
 Uh... 
 I'm taking over the Met investigation into the activities of DCI Tom Kendrick. 
 I know you had dealings with him. 
 Many people did. 
 He was head of procurement. 
 He put a lot of work your way. 
 He put work everyone's way. 
 You paid Tom Kendrick back-handers. 
 I can demonstrate that very clearly. 
 You weren't alone. Everyone paid him. 
 I'm not interested in that. 
 I believe Tom Kendrick was involved with some serious criminals. 
 People powerful enough to kill a police officer and feel protected. 
 Kendrick was murdered? 
 You were there, you tell me. 
 You did clean the scene. 
 Yes, um... but I understood it was suicide. 
 The death of a fellow officer seems to put everyone on edge. 
 It's early days, but anything you know, scenes you cleaned, paperwork you might have, photographs, logbooks, diaries... anything you think could help. 
 Keep in touch. 
 I'll see myself out. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm looking for someone. 
 Who? 
 Veysel Kisa. 
 Are you a friend? 
 I'm a friend of a friend. I need to talk to him. 
 Tell him Frank McElroy is dead. 
 I know a Veysel. 
 It might be the same one. 
 He's kind of difficult to get hold of. 
 But I can try. 
 I don't usually take the time for meet and greets. 
 But you have my attention. 
 We've lost £100 000 worth of A-grade heroin. 
 That was clumsy. 
 We think you have it. 
 I don't. 
 We need payment, or our product back. 
 This is the last time I will repeat myself, and I do it out of politeness because you are tourists in my city. 
 I don't have any heroin. 
 A-grade or otherwise. 
 We were told you did. 
 You were misinformed. 
 Lying f*ck! 
 No, no, no! 
 Martin Bastière is the lying f*ck! 
 A guy called Martin Bastière told us that you took it from him. 
 And it wasn't hard to find you, so, we figured that you must be a player. 
 You know Martin Bastière. 
 I don't know any French man. 
 Do we know any French man, Denny ? 
 I know a couple Spanish, a Swede, no French though. Seen 'em on telly. 
 No French. 
 Sounds to me, like you all need to keep a closer eye on your heroin. 
 Do you think I'm stupid? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I do. 
 That is exactly what I think. 
 Don't talk anymore. 
 Get on your feet, and leave. 
 Okay, we go. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 Hello? 
 Hello, who's this? 
 Maddy? 
 So, you didn't drown. 
 No, I didn't. But my shoulder hurts if it makes you feel any better. 
 I should have cut your throat! 
 Maybe. 
 But you didn't. 
 Nelson Clay doesn't have my heroin. 
 You've met him? 
 No, we tweeted him, you lying prick! 
 Oh, there you are, you sh1t for brains. 
 Romain took off your kit mask, did he, uh? 
 I gotta go now, miss you already. 
 We will find you! 
 Ciao! 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Excuse me, do you have this in my size? 
 I have already had 127 hits. 
 Well, then your life is now worthwhile. 
 Hm. 
 It's mostly just... samples and drawings, a few images of pieces I admire, some of Maddy's photos. 
 Bastieredesign.com is alive and kicking. Hm! 
 You all right? 
 No. Eh... ah... I think I may have made a bit of an ass of myself. 
 Right... 
 He proposed. 
 Philip? 
 Mm... now, I mean he's very nice, but... 
 I've been married twice already. 
 If I'm ever going to do it again, he is going to have to rock my world. 
 How did you know? You know, that Jean was... the one. 
 You know, just never really thought about it, he just... was. 
 Did I really just use the phrase "the one"? 
 Yeah, you did. You know, that makes you officially lonely. 
 Right, now listen I'm going to pop by tomorrow. 
 Okay, not too early. It's Maddy's first day at school. 
 Oh, Jesus! 
 I would rather gnaw my own nipple off than go back to school Really? 
 Oh, I'd get back in a heartbeat. 
 Freak. 
 Hm. 
 Hey. 
 Everything okay? 
 I can help. 
 What? 
 Everything's fine. It's good. Don't worry about it. 
 I can help. 
 I don't even know what you... 
 Our petty cash flow averages £500 to £700 across an average week, give or take. 
 Less lately, 'cause things have been a bit tight. 
 If I open the safe now, I'd find close to £56,000 in used notes, bound and stacked in neat little piles. 
 That's 30,000 more than was in there last week. 
 Detective Chief Inspector Squire seems like a very serious woman. 
 I think she is. 
 Promise me you're not hurting anyone. 
 I'm not hurting anyone. 
 Are you in danger? 
 My father has dementia, he's in a nursing home. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, don't be. 
 He's an horrible man. Being such a c**t's the only thing that's keeping him going. 
 Okay. 
 I do the books for them, gratis. 
 It takes the edge off the fees which are a disgrace for the level of care they offer. 
 I have access to the records of all of the nursing homes in the group, going back 8 years. 
 I can create false invoices for cleaning jobs on deaths that have actually happened. 
 You mean, launder the money? 
 We'd run two diaries. 
 Make sure that very job was detailed, accounted for. 
 The second diary would be for the off-the-record jobs. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Because I love my job. 
 And I was here from the start, and I don't want to lose it because of temporary difficulties. 
 You'd be exposed. 
 I'm already exposed. 
 I can help. 
 
 
 
 You're always sad. 
 No, I'm not. 
 You are. Like everything's tragic all the time. 
 I seem like a tragic guy to you? 
 I got you, Ollie, Mom, I'm the luckiest guy I know. 
 If you're going to lie, at least put some efforts into it. 
 That was rubbish. 
 Do you wanna share? 
 Kids sharing an adult problem isn't always a good idea. 
 So you do have problems. 
 What are you, a cop? 
 I'd be a great cop. 
 You'd be a great anything. 
 Beat it. 
 You're drunk. 
 I've been trying really hard, but no. 
 Have you changed your mind? 
 No. 
 Can we talk? 
 No. 
 I found someone. 
 I don't care. I don't want you to interfere. Stay away. 
 You don't even factor in my thinking. 
 Yeah, you said that already. 
 Right before you called me for help. 
 You're pissing me off! 
 Yeah, I piss everybody off, that's my thing. 
 Mom? 
 Mom? 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Urgh! Urgh! 
 Urgh! 
 Ah! 
 Urgh! Urgh! 
 Ah! 
 Urgh! Urgh! 
 Urgh! 
 Ah! Ah! Ah! 
 I... I'm looking for Claire. 
 She's asleep. 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 Are you the French man? 
 Yeah. 
 Claire! 
 Take your shoes off. 
 What's going on? 
 Booty call. You owe me. 
 Sorry. 
 I saw a man killed yesterday. 
 They shot him. in the heart. 
 Right in front of us. 
 Us? 
 My brother and some guys that work for this gangster. 
 He wants me to clean it up, remove the body, get rid of the evidence. 
 Can you do that? 
 Yes. 
 If I do, he owns me. 
 Accessory to murder, along with everything else. 
 This main guy he has a brother. 
 Properly evil guy. 
 And I made an enemy of him. 
 I'm sorry, I don't want to frighten you. 
 No. 
 I wanna know. 
 Hello? 
 Yes, speaking. 
 Oh, God! 
 Um, right. 
 Yeah, no, I understand. 
 Okay, I'll be there right away. 
 f*ck! 
 Oh, Jean, it's me! Where are you? 
 Where are you all the bloody time? Um, call me when you get this! 
 Martin? 
 Sorry. 
 Mornin'. 
 Listen, a pipe's busted the studio. 
 The ceiling's fallen in, I've gotta get over there. 
 Oh, it's terrible. You want me to go? 
 No, it has to be me 'cause I'm the tenant. 
 But can you stay with Maddy? 
 Sure. 
 Okay, she's got her induction at the school at 11 o'clock. 
 I'll be back in time to take her, but she needs to be ready. 
 Okay. What about Oliver? 
 Uh, no, I've already taken him. 
 Listen, I owe you. Thank you. 
 Maddy? 
 Maddy? 
 Maddy? 
 Maddy? 
 Maddy? 
 Maddy? 
 No! 
 Don't come in! 
 Okay. 
 Has Mom left already? 
 Yeah, it's just you and me. Are you ready for school? 
 No! 
 Come on, it won't be that bad. 
 When's Mom back? 
 You do look something in that uniform, you know? 
 Can you wait downstairs, please? 
 Are you okay? 
 I've... I've started my period. 
 Oh. 
 Um... 
 You sure you got everything you need? 
 I don't know. 
 Um... 
 Are you looking through your mom's stuff? 
 I have. There's a lot of different things. 
 And anything that looks right? 
 No! 
 You sure you don't want me to come in? 
 No! 
 Oh... 
 What about the... the pad thing with the little wings? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Oh my god. 
 I'm gonna go to the shop. 
 See what they have, and, um... 
 I'll leave you a hot water bottle, so you can rub... 
 Okay! 
 Are you gonna me moody from now on? 
 Shut up! 
 Okay. 
 Ah, I'll be right back. 
 Oh, hey. 
 What time is it? 
 Late. I let you sleep. 
 How late? 
 9.30. 
 f*ck. 
 This is a one-off, you can't come here again. 
 Why not? 
 'Cause you're not invited. 
 This is my space. 
 Hello. 
 Hey. 
 What? 
 I can't come now. 
 D... don't worry. 
 We'll fix it. 
 Who's taking Maddy? 
 Okay. 
 I'm on my way back. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 That's why not. 
 Don't take a phone call like that in front of me again. 
 I got you one of everything they had, just to stay on the safe side. 
 And... 
 I made you hot chocolate. 
 Because in my experience, women love chocolate. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, sign here, please. 
 Thanks. I'll get my solicitor to call you about repairs. 
 You got your insurance details? 
 Yeah, they're at my husband's office, but I'll get them to you later. 
 Best of luck. 
 Thank you. 
 Jesus! 
 It is f*cking carnage! 
 Jean is nowhere to be seen, and I'm missing Maddy's first day at Kings Gate. 
 Kids are resilient. 
 Maddy holds grudges. 
 When I was her age, Dad took me out for a drive to Suffolk. 
 Kicked me out to the curb with and apple and fiver, and told me to find my own way home. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Taught me independence. 
 Look, kids are tough. 
 f*cking Suffolk though. 
 It was like being stranded in the 17th century. 
 Well how did you get home? 
 Gave a policeman a hand-job. 
 I think that's how I first became interested in the law. 
 Right, well, what's next? 
 Insurance. 
 f*ck, this is gonna take all day. 
 Are you feeling better? 
 I don't smoke. 
 Not even now that you're a real woman? 
 Oh! 
 So what now? 
 My womb will shed for 4 to 5 days. 
 And then I wait a month until the next time. 
 In about 40 years, I dry up again. 
 They teach you that in school? 
 Google. 
 Yeah? 
 4 to 5 days? 
 Mostly. 
 Do you feel any different? 
 I'm not in pain. 
 Mom always gets pains. 
 You... you look in pain. 
 That's because it's like 50 degrees in here, but thanks. 
 Do you want to bunk school? Celebrate? 
 I can't, it's my induction, remember? 
 Shall I take you? 
 They love me at your fancy school. 
 They think I'm a proper gentleman. 
 What else can I take? 
 Whatever you need. 
 Is anyone free? 
 Oh, no, it's fine. I can do it. 
 Well, Rosie's free. She's just coming from the Islington Terrace job. 
 We own a cleaning company. 
 Don't be so stubborn. 
 I'm not being stubborn. 
 Rosie can help. 
 It'll be fine. 
 I know it'll be fine. 
 I'm a big girl. 
 I can make phone calls to insurance companies all by myself. 
 You're right. 
 Sorry. 
 How was last night? 
 Fine. 
 Dull. 
 What are you doing? 
 I need to know your decision. 
 The answer is no. 
 You sure? 
 It's not something I can do. 
 I met two friends of your brother earlier. 
 Here from their mother country, looking for Martin. 
 Some dispute they've had over drugs and money. 
 Muscley guy and a younger one. 
 Smarter. Who were they? 
 Nico and Romey. 
 Romain. 
 Probably. 
 And what did you tell them? 
 Do the job I've asked you or I will send Romey and Nico after your brother, and after your home. 
 Get your stuff. 
 Sure you don't want me to come in with you? 
 No, I'll be okay from here. 
 Are you nervous? 
 No. 
 Everybody's nervous on the first day. 
 You'll be great. 
 Thank you for this morning. 
 You're welcome. 
 Where are they? 
 I got 5 minutes before I pick up my son from nursery. 
 Who are you? 
 My name is Martin Bastière. 
 What do you know? 
 I know Nelson Clay shot and killed Frank McElroy. 
 Why should I believe you? 
 Because you haven't been able to contact Frank since I've been here yesterday. 
 Maybe Nelson knows you stole from him. 
 What's your interest in this? 
 My brother is a very talented man. 
 He's a cleaner. 
 He can manipulate a situation, a crime scene for example, so that it tells the story you want. 
 He can even make it disappear completely. 
 Forensics? 
 We're better than them. I work with him. 
 I'm his consigliere. 
 Now you've come to see us. 
 Frank said you could be trusted. 
 Nelson Clay is blackmailing us. 
 He's forcing us to participate in death, in killings. 
 And? 
 And I'm offering you our services, in exchange for your protection against Nelson Clay and a little problem that has been following me from France. 
 We'll work for you. 
 This is a sales pitch? 
 Yes. 
 Very good. 
 Show me. 
 Okay. 
 Very good. 
 I... think he's been called away. 
 Thanks, Maureen. 
 Rosie won't be long. Can I get you anything? 
 No, I'm just on hold. 
 Thanks. 
 MORTGAGE It's not complicated. 
 Won't take long. 
 Beautiful piece of music this. 
 No, I'm not asking for access to the account, I'm just asking for confirmation that the account exists. 
 Okay, well, is it possible for there to be a mortgage against my home, which I'm co-owner of, without my knowledge? 
 Yes? 
 Is everything all right? 
 Everything's fine. Thank you. 
 Okay, it's almost a million pounds borrowed against my house. 
 Don't you think I have a right to know? 
 Jean? 
 I'm proud of you for standing up to me today. 
 Frank said you'll kill me too one day. 
 That's a possibility. 
 That doesn't mean we can't have a good relationship in the meantime. 
 I'd like you to bring your wife, over for dinner. 
 Absolutely not. 
 I insist. 
 Sonny gets back tonight. I was planning to cook. 
 Around 8 would be good. 
 Hey. 
 Where are you going? 
 Work thing of Dad's. Dinner with a client. 
 I'd rather burn matchsticks under my fingernails. 
 Have you got anything you want to talk through? 
 No. 
 I'm so, so sorry about today. 
 Uncle Martin was really good. He saved the day. 
 Not for the first time. 
 I would have freaked out otherwise. 
 You had totally the wrong stuff for my age. 
 He went to the shop and bought one of everything. 
 I don't think I had gone to school if he hadn't. 
 Right, what are you talking about? 
 I ended up using one of those all-night pad-ultra things. 
 Seemed the safest. 
 Today? 
 Oh honey, why didn't you call me? I'm so sorry! 
 We were fine. 
 But that's not the point, I should have been here. 
 Mom, I need a way to get money. 
 Don't interrupt. 
 Sorry. 
 Listen, we'll go and get supplies tomorrow. 
 Okay? We'll go to the chemist. 
 How can I get some money? 
 What for? 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Hey. 
 For supplies. 
 You look good. 
 Thank you. 
 So can we talk about it in the morning? 
 How did you and Nelson first meet? 
 I worked at the hospice where his first wife died of cancer. 
 It's... what it trained us. A nurse. 
 That can't have been easy being... second wife under those circumstances. 
 It has its moments. 
 You didn't know that your husband had been in care, did you? 
 No. 
 Don't be upset about it. 
 Some people never come to terms with being in care. 
 Something very bad happened... to them when they were kids. Uh, to Jean and his brother. 
 They're both still battered by it. 
 I think I met the brother. 
 Martin? 
 Hmm. 
 He's a law unto himself. 
 Ah. 
 Too many secrets. 
 What does she do? 
 There's no way she's content with playing house. 
 She has a furniture design business. 
 Well, she's just starting up. 
 That's what she studied. 
 Then she got pregnant, and life happened. 
 Is she good? 
 She's good at everything she tries. 
 For today. 
 Keeps it professional... 
 Julie's lovely. 
 I'm sorry about tonight. 
 Which part? 
 All of it. 
 You shouldn't be exposed to those things. 
 I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 
 We were put in care, after my father died, for a couple of years. 
 It wasn't great. 
 Where was your mother? 
 She was getting l lost in drink around that time. 
 Because of your father? 
 Partly. 
 She had a lover. 
 Do you lie to me much? 
 What? No. 
 What kind of question is that? 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Probably just the wine. 
 So this is where we keep all the chemical products that we use to clean. 
 And this is the sponges, the tea bag, the gloves, you name it... 
 Uh, this is the common room and this is the locker room. 
 So, what do you want me to do? A demo? 
 Food dye? 
 Something we use for training? 
 That won't be necessary. 
 This is good. 
 He's got a beautiful young wife. 
 Mother to his son. 
 And he hits her. 
 Okay. Show me. 
 Don't turn on the shower. 
 Do it like you would if you were outside. 
 Come on. 
 We're your new friends.
