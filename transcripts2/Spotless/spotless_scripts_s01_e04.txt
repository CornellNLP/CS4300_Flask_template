 Previously on Spotless... 
 I want you to make it look like suicide. 
 Do you realise you guys just wasted a pretty senior cop? 
 Mate, we are too big to fail. 
 Sorry. I'm sure my husband will be here any minute. 
 See you later. 
 Madam. 
 I do apologize. 
 It has been a bitch of a morning. 
 I think this is going very well. 
 You can take your hand off my arse now. 
 Sorry. 
 He's around here. 
 I can smell him. 
 Spending our money. 
 This could kill you. 
 Where is it? 
 I flushed it down the toilet. 
 What is it? 
 I think he's a cop. 
 You know he was under investigation. 
 I had heard. 
 It can be a brave way out, suicide. 
 Bollocks. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Confession. 
 Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sunday afternoons. 
 I came here to see you. 
 Julie thinks you're out drinking. 
 Don't worry, I won't tell her. 
 Ruin your legend. 
 With all due respect to my surroundings, f*ck you. 
 I thought you didn't believe in God. 
 I don't. 
 It's just mythology. 
 I like churches though. 
 I like the peace. 
 Why did you stay? 
 I can go if you want. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 I'm scared you know. 
 It's not just you and me anymore. 
 There's Julie, the kids. 
 These guys in our lives... 
 I have no control. 
 You can't always control everything. 
 Life doesn't work that way. 
 Do you ever think about him? 
 Who, Jesus ? 
 No, the guy we killed. 
 He had a wife and kids. 
 We changed their lives forever. 
 I have to go. 
 Do you have more karate stuff? 
 It's kickboxing! 
 And no, I've got a hot date. 
 That's cool. 
 I know it is. 
 How far would you go to protect someone you love? 
 Wherever it takes. 
 If it's illegal? 
 If people get hurt? 
 What kind of trouble are you in? 
 The worst. 
 Some people died. 
 But you didn't kill anybody. 
 No. I wouldn't do that. 
 Can you get out of it? 
 I'm trying. 
 But they won't let you? 
 You're a good guy. 
 But if you're dealing with bad guys, you have to be prepared to do whatever it takes. 
 Do you really have a hot date? 
 I'm meeting my mom today. She's having chemo. 
 How is she? 
 She's strong. 
 This is a waste of time. 
 There's like 8 millions people in London, and you want to go door to door? 
 Maybe you could cut up some more people with your knife, I mean, that worked so well for us before. 
 My turn. 
 Hey. 
 I'm looking for this guy. 
 He kidnapped my sister's baby. Custody thing, you know? 
 Nah, sorry, mate. 
 Kidnapped? 
 Yeah, if we invent a story, it passes the time, it keeps the interest up. 
 It's great. 
 It's a shitty old dump. 
 But it's my shitty old dump. 
 Oh for f*ck's sake. 
 Get a room. 
 Actually, scrap that, why don't you just mount him here, in amongst the turpentine and wood shavings. 
 Oh, don't tempt me! I f*cking love this amount of sawdust. 
 Yeah, wood is like some kind of aphrodisiac for her. 
 As delightfully grubby as that sounds, I need to get to work. 
 Hey. 
 Thank you. 
 Shut up and make a chair. 
 You're an awesome sister-in-law. 
 I can only agree. 
 Happy? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah I think I am. 
 Oh f*ck. 
 Where's Maureen? 
 I don't know who that is. 
 We gave you a phone. 
 Yeah, it's in a drawer at home. 
 Well, that'd be why you don't hear us when we call. And, um, we have been calling. 
 I can't... always be available. 
 You know what. 
 Your brother said exactly the same thing. 
 Thanks for coming so quickly. 
 Let me introduce you to Andrew St. John-Paine. 
 Candidate for deputy mayor of this fierce city. 
 Four terms counselor for the borough of Croydon, rising political star... 
 A very dear friend of mine. 
 What's wrong with him? 
 Come with me. 
 That's not good. 
 No. 
 Her name was Joanna. 
 High-end. Nice girl. 
 I've known her a decade probably. 
 Well, knew her. 
 What killed her? 
 Drugs. 
 Heroin. 
 Yeah, she OD-ed. 
 That's Paine's story. 
 They partied for a while, had s*x, partied some more. 
 She suggested they speedball. 
 He declined. She went ahead, shot up in the bathroom. 
 Came back a little wasted, but you know, still... game. 
 A little heavy petting and she just... went. 
 He thought she was asleep. 
 Well, he might be telling the truth. 
 I don't see any signs of struggle. 
 What do you want from us? 
 Joanna was Paine's date at an official function last night. 
 He's married. Three kids: 4, 7 and 10, two boys and a girl. 
 They've been seen together, photographed, CCTV. 
 If she's found dead here, and he's implicated, then he's finished. 
 Must be pretty useful to have a politician who owes you his life. 
 Nobody likes it. But it is what it is. 
 We have to look to the future. 
 So what do you want? You want us to clean the room, get rid of the body because your brother owns this flat? 
 I let my friends entertain here. 
 No, if she disappears, someone will miss her, and your friend will still be the last one to see her alive. 
 I want you to fix it. 
 She's not a criminal, or a killer, or a tough guy. 
 I know. 
 She's somebody's daughter. 
 Who are you mourning for? 
 The girl? 
 Yourself? 
 I have to ask him some questions. 
 I need you to answer fully and honestly. 
 Of course. 
 Look at me. 
 You had s*x with the girl last night? 
 Yes. 
 Did you wear a condom? 
 Yes. 
 The whole time? 
 Yes. 
 You didn't deposit any bodily fluids inside her? 
 No. 
 In her mouth? 
 Are you getting off on that. 
 A woman died here. 
 And listen, I don't like this any more than you. 
 But I need to know exactly what happened, every detail. 
 Did she suck your cock? 
 f*cking hell! 
 Did she? 
 No. 
 Did you go down on her? 
 No. 
 a**l s*x? 
 You on her, her on you? 
 No. 
 He's a traditional kind of guy. 
 Why is she restrained? 
 It was her idea. 
 Joanna was very sexual. 
 She liked... 
 I don't need to know that. 
 Did you use the heroin? 
 I... I did a couple lines of coke to be social, but... 
 I'm not into hard drugs. 
 Did she live alone? 
 I believe she did, yes. 
 OK. Well, we can move her, to her home, clean every trace of your "good friend", I'll stage her death as just... another drug's casualty. 
 You can do that? 
 Not perfectly. 
 Maybe enough to give the appearance of it. 
 Leading the investigators towards a preferred conclusion. 
 And you'll clean this apartment. 
 Yeah. 
 I need my gear. 
 Joey and I will stay, help out. 
 No. 
 I want him to do it. 
 He's got some ground to make up, Joey. 
 He can start here. 
 I'm so grateful. 
 I had no idea... 
 Be quiet. 
 I loathe you. 
 And now I own you. 
 You better have a very long and a very successful career. 
 I have a bad feeling about this. 
 This is not a nice situation. 
 What we're trying to do forensically, it's f*cking nuts! 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Well, Padraig and Rosie, they're on a job, at the morgue, South Ken Hospital. 
 It's a regular contract. I'm supposed to be there, but... 
 I think you should go instead. 
 If everything goes well, then great, but... if it doesn't, at least one of us will stay alive, and not go to jail. 
 
 
 
 Hello? 
 Mrs Bastière? 
 Speaking. 
 It's Marcella Collins, at St. Bart's, Madeleine's form teacher. 
 Yes, hello Miss Collins. 
 Madeleine attended registration this morning, but none of her classes since. 
 We haven't received a letter from you regretting an absence. 
 No... 
 So she is truanting? 
 Maddy is a bit unsettled. 
 This is her last week with you. She starts at Kings Gate on Monday. 
 Yes, that is unfortunate. 
 What would you suggest I do? Comb the streets looking for her? 
 Are any of her friends absent? 
 No, it seems to be just Madeleine. 
 And I have to say, it's not entirely a shock. 
 Has it been long Miss Collins? 
 Um... I'm sorry? 
 Since you got laid. Because the general consensus in our household is that you really need it. 
 Right there, next to her. 
 A little bit closer. 
 Yeah, that's good. 
 I've known her since she was 19. 
 Beautiful kid. 
 Did she always do drugs? 
 No. 
 Only since she started to f*ck scumbags like St. John-Paine. 
 We'll give her a decent death. 
 So what now? 
 Well, we wanna disturb the body as little as possible. 
 Slowly! Slowly! 
 Follow me. 
 Buy two things? 
 Have enough? All right. 
 I'm looking for this guy. 
 He has amnesia. 
 Wears a rose in his buttonhole. 
 No, sorry. 
 Ask your friend. 
 Have you seen this guy? 
 No. 
 No. 
 We're busy. 
 Go f*ck yourself. 
 He's a charming guy, my friend. 
 Do you understand me? My accent? 
 I mean, I'm French. 
 Not everybody in France is so nasty, like him. 
 Don't let it put you off. 
 You don't talk much, uh? 
 Why are you looking for the man in the photograph? 
 He's a thief, you know. A robber. 
 He stole some pretty important things from a big museum. 
 That's why my friend is so angry. 
 In fact, he's had lots of reasons why he's so angry. 
 That's just one of them. 
 You shouldn't stare, kid. 
 It's a bad habit. 
 Tchao. 
 Wait here. 
 So what now? 
 Well, the best thing to do is skip your DNA off the premises. 
 If I need you, I'll call. 
 We're supposed to help you. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, what are you gonna do? 
 Clean, and set the scene. 
 I think I should stay. 
 Knock yourself out. 
 In the car. 
 I'll get my stuff. 
 How long are you gonna be? 
 What? 
 Just... listen, I'm... 
 I'm sorry, right, 'cause you know, I'm the one who got you involved in all this. 
 It has no happy ending. 
 Look at what he did to f*cking Kendrick. 
 You know, he knew the man for 20 years. 
 He took him to the racing, to restaurants, his wife and family. 
 You pulled the trigger. 
 Yeah. 
 I did. 
 And you see how he treats me now. 
 I'm making plans. 
 You should too. 
 Oh, f*cking students, always leave the place in a state. 
 Well, it's probably good that they get to practice though, before they start slicing up live people. 
 I thought they cleaned this sh1t up as they go. 
 Yeah, they do. 
 But once a week, we get the joy of a deep clean. 
 Ready? 
 Hey! 
 Hello? 
 Mrs Julie Bastière? 
 Yeah. Sorry, if you're selling anything, I'm really not interested. 
 This is the custody sergeant at West End Central Police Station. 
 Yes, hello sir, this is Mrs Bastière. 
 I believe we have your daughter, Madeleine, with us. 
 Oy, what the f*ck is he doing? 
 Shut up. 
 We're meant to be keeping an eye. 
 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. 
 Yeah, you f*cking prick. 
 Is this a new thing? 
 Hmm? 
 Shoplifting? 
 Well, I bet that hurts. 
 Is this about changing schools? 
 Maddy, do you not want to go to Kings Gate? 
 It's you who wants it, not me. 
 Well, you won't believe me when I tell you this, but actually, it's your dad's idea to change schools. 
 He never had a chance at an education. 
 He wants the best for you. 
 Some parents believe that a good education is the best gift a parent can give a child. 
 Do you? 
 Well, better to have it than not. 
 And changing schools, It's a... an opportunity, you know, you can reinvent yourself. 
 You can be anything you want to be. 
 Do I have to go back to St. Bart's. 
 No. 
 I think you're done with St. Bart's. 
 I told your form teacher she needed to get laid. 
 She really does. 
 Come here. 
 Well, I'm gonna have a cigarette. 
 You can't smoke in here. 
 Outside. 
 Do you want a coffee? 
 Yeah. 
 Can I borrow money from you? 
 There's some petty cash in the van under the passenger seat, but bring me a receipt. 
 Right. 
 I knew that. 
 This guy! 
 Excuse me sir, you can't do that in here. Excuse me! 
 Please, excuse me. 
 Thank you. 
 Excuse me? 
 Can I have one of those? 
 Got a light? 
 Thanks. 
 So, if you had to count, How many women would you say you had s*x with? 
 One. 
 One? 
 My wife. 
 Every night for 35 years. 
 Never miss. 
 sh1t. 
 Why are we wasting our time at the f*cking hospital? 
 I'll see you around, buddy. 
 Maybe not. 
 He's here, go! 
 Open the door! 
 Open that f*cking door! 
 Putain ! 
 sh1t! 
 Oy! w*nk*r! 
 Watch where you're f*cking going! 
 sh1t! f*cking leg! 
 f*cking leg! f*cking leg! 
 You, f*cking idiot! 
 You f*cking idiot. 
 What do you want? You stole from me. 
 It's poker. Everybody steals from everybody. 
 Where are the drugs? 
 What drugs? 
 The... the girl has them. 
 What girl? 
 The drug mule. 
 Where is she? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Where are my drugs? 
 f*ck off! 
 They're not your drugs. You're a f*cking lap dog. 
 Before I kill you, and I will kill you, you're gonna tell me where my drugs are. 
 OK, OK, I f*cked her! 
 I f*cked her and then she died. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 I tried to sell the drugs, to a guy called Nelson Clay. 
 He's a big guy here. 
 He lied. He took the drugs, never paid! 
 And when I told him about you guys, he... he laughed at me! 
 I swear! Oh, f*ck! 
 Nelson Clay? 
 sh1t! 
 Grab him! 
 Where is he? 
 I think he went under. 
 Go in. 
 What? 
 I... I got a little bit of vertigo. 
 Jump in, find him. 
 You jump in, you f*cking lunatic! 
 f*ck! 
 What the f*ck you're doing? 
 I thought... I thought you'd gone. 
 She's still a f*cking person! 
 I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 
 You're f*cking sick! 
 Hey, hey, what's all the noise? 
 f*ck. 
 Get Nelson! 
 No, no, no, please! Please, no! 
 Call him! 
 No, f*ck... 
 Please! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! 
 It was a mistake. 
 Get your f*cking hand off my arm immediately. 
 Do you want something? 
 No. 
 What are the options? 
 There's no options. 
 His DNA is inside her, and, I can't fix that. 
 We have to burn the place. 
 There'll be a fire investigation. 
 Yeah, but, but they girl's body won't give off any evidence. 
 Victor married young. 
 18. 
 She was a lovely girl. 
 Best thing that ever happened to him. 
 Being my younger brother, he had a certain licence to behave badly, which he did. 
 Finally, she decided after, 7, 8 years, to leave him. 
 He came back after a 3-day binder, still wild. 
 Her bags were packed. She was good to go. 
 And she wouldn't be talked around. 
 So he killed her. 
 With his fists. 
 The next morning, sober, he can't believe he's killed the only thing that mattered to him. 
 His one chance at a good life. 
 So, grief-stricken, he carries her up to the marital bed... 
 Jeez. 
 ... And tries to "love" her back to life. 
 It was 7 days before I went looking for him. 
 He's sick. 
 Yes, he is. 
 As far as I'm aware, it hasn't happened since. 
 You believe that? 
 Yes, I do. 
 And he will never, do it again. 
 Oh, hell, f*ck. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Here you go. 
 sh1t! 
 f*ck! 
 We're working against the clock. 
 We'll have to take it with us now. 
 Well, it's a murdered cat! 
 Aren't we trying not to draw attention? 
 I'll... I'll get the cat, boss. 
 Your brother might be home. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You all right? 
 I'm fine. 
 Well, you're soaking wet. 
 Shouldn't you be in the hospital? 
 I can't. 
 All right, Maddy, go to my bathroom, and take all the cotton pads you can find, disinfectant, antiseptic, anything you can carry, OK? OK, go. 
 Should we be worried about you? 
 Don't worry about me. 
 Us? 
 I would never hurt you guys. 
 OK, I'm gonna try and find a bandage. Maddy, come here. 
 I need you to put pressure on the wound, OK? 
 OK. 
 Real pressure. 
 You can press harder. 
 Are you OK? 
 I'm OK. 
 I can feel your heart. 
 That's good. 
 Hey, big man. 
 Hey. 
 What happened? 
 Did the French guys get you? 
 Scallions weren't ready yet. 
 I thought you'd rather do without than pick them early. 
 Good call. 
 Bok choy, rainbow chards, baby carrots, broad beans. 
 All fresh. Take them home to the wife. 
 I'll take the cat. 
 Give me the cat. 
 Apparently it's an old wives' tale, but burying them in the allotments stops the others coming around, sh1tting all over the place. 
 Bonsoir. 
 Hey. 
 I missed you today. 
 Are you OK? 
 Shitty day. Shitty job. 
 Listen, you're not the only one. 
 I think your brother's really hurt. 
 Who did that? 
 The guys, from St-Nazaire. 
 What happened? 
 One of them stabbed me. 
 But don't worry, it's clean. 
 Do they know you're in my house? 
 If they did, they would have come already. 
 But they will come, right? 
 That's why I came back. 
 It wouldn't be fair just to leave you with it. 
 God, this weed is strong. 
 Give me that. 
 Nelson's brother f*cked a dead girl today. 
 I had to burn the body. 
 I never know anyone who f*cked a dead person before. 
 I know a guy who f*cked a goat once. 
 "Pascal the goat fucker" we'd call him. 
 This weed is really strong. 
 It's just tobacco, it's not weed. 
 Yeah? 
 I know where you live. 
 I know where your family is. 
 I know where your wife works. 
 I know where your kids go to school. 
 I am gonna hurt them. 
 I am gonna make them bleed. 
 Nelson won't go for that. 
 You think he'll chose you over me? 
 No. 
 After that, I am coming for you. 
 You f*cking grass c**t. 
 f*ck! Martin! Martin! 
 You're all right? 
 Julie? 
 Open your eyes. Open your eyes. There you go. 
 You're all right.
