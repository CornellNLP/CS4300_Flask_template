 Giddy, what are you doing? 
 Trying to find the purple golf ball. 
 What purple golf ball? 
 The one Sam and Freddie told us about. 
 We are good. 
 We are. 
 Why? 
 Why what? 
 I'm not playing. 
 Why did you guys intentionally sabotage my interview? 
 Don't nonchalantly sip your drinks. 
 Answer me. 
 We didn't want you to go. 
 You wouldn't like it at briarwood. 
 We were just thinking of you. 
 No, you were just thinking of yourselves. 
 Carls. 
 This interview was really important to me. 
 You don't wanna go to snotty rich kid school. 
 Maybe I don't or maybe I did, But it doesn't matter now 
 'cause I'll never be able to make the choice, Cause you guys ruined it for me. 
 Come on, what we did wasn't that bad. 
 Purple ball. 
 They wanted a purple ball. 
 I never had a purple ball. 
 I'm going home now. 
 Wait. 
 Mrs. Peeloff. 
 Don't blame Carly for all this stuff. 
 She had nothing to do with it. 
 We tried to mess up her interview cause-- 
 Cause, she's like our best friend. 
 And we didn't want her to leave our school. 
 'cause we'd miss her. 
 But she likes the best kid You could ever get at briarwood. 
 So don't not let her in Just because she's got a couple of rotten friends. 
 You guys aren't rotten, Usually. 
 Well, I do think, There's something to be said For a girl who has friends Who care so much about her. 
 We do. 
 So I might still get In to briarwood? 
 Well I won't make any promises, but I think There's a good chance a student-- 
 There she went. 
 Give me the purple ball. 
 I don't have the purple ball. 
 Go help her. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, guys get out of there. 
 Come on. 
 They chased her into Spencer's shower. 
 I didn't really want to go to briarwood anyway.
