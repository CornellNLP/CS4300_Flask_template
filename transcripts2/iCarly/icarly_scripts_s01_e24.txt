 Okay. 
 To wrap up this webcast-- 
 Each of us is gonna paint a picture in only 10 seconds. 
 And then you, The "iCarly" viewers, Are gonna vote online for whose painting is best. 
 It's our wacky, little friend, Gibby. 
 You really do it, Gibby? 
 Sure, whatever. 
 Ten seconds on the clock. 
 And go. 
 Try not to move. 
 Hold still, Gibby. 
 Five seconds. 
 The brushes tickle. 
 Time. 
 Okay. 
 Now here's my painting. 
 Who's that? Freddie? 
 No, it's a clown. 
 Oops. Sorry, clown. 
 And now, let's take a look at Sam's painting. 
 Okay, I have no idea what that is. 
 It's a meatball. 
 Yes, Sam has painted her dream. 
 Okay. 
 Till the next "iCarly." 
 Bye. Ciao. 
 See you. 
 And we're clear. 
 Hey, you should go Rinse the paint off first. 
 You're gonna ruin your shirt. 
 Who cares about my shirt? 
 Who cares about anything? 
 Not me. 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 Good. 
 Who's up for chicken wings? I know I am. 
 Shannon Mitchell, okay? 
 What about Shannon? 
 What's the prob? 
 I want her to like me, But every time I try to talk to her, I get all shy. 
 Why does she have to be so cute? 
 I'm going' home. 
 Gibby-- 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 Oh, poor kid. 
 It must be awful to love someone who doesn't love you back. 
 Sorry. 
 I know, you see. 
 Somehow the world will change for me. 
 And be so wonderful. 
 Live life, breathe air. 
 I know somehow we gonna get there. 
 And feel so wonderful. 
 It's all for real. 
 I'm telling you just how I feel. 
 So wake up the members of my nation. 
 It's your time to be. 
 There's no chance unless you take one. 
 And the time to see the brighter side of every situation. 
 Some things are meant to be. 
 So give your best and leave the rest to me. 
 Leave it all to me. 
 Leave it all to me. 
 Just leave it all to me. iCarly S01E25 iWin a date Oh, there he is. 
 Hey, Gibby. 
 What's up? 
 We came up with a great way to set you up with Shannon. 
 How? 
 On the next "iCarly", We're gonna play a game Called "I win a date." 
 "I win a date"? 
 Yeah. 
 And you're gonna be the special mystery date. 
 And we're gonna get Shannon to be one of the contestants. 
 So that way-- 
 Who's your friend and why is he staring at me like a freak? 
 Oh, this is Reuben. 
 Sorry. 
 Zipang. 
 Okay, I think I gotta punch this kid in the mouth. 
 Wait, I think he might be complimenting you. 
 Was that a compliment? 
 Hey, just cause I bump the chump Doesn't mean I lost my bingo trap. 
 That is so true. 
 No. no. 
 Stephanie, I really don't think we should go out again. 
 Come on, I didn't say I had a bad time last night. 
 It's just--Stephanie-- 
 Step--Steph-- 
 Because I don't like you. 
 So, I guess your blind date Went pretty well last night. 
 She brought her pet unicorn to dinner. 
 There's no such thing as unicorns. 
 Try telling her that. 
 I'm just gonna stay single the rest of my life. 
 They'll call me "single Spencer," 
 The guy with no lady to hold. 
 Why don't you try one of those dating websites Like whynotdateme.com, You know, where lonely adults Find even lonelier adults? 
 Sounds so tempting. 
 At least you get to see a video Of the person before you go on a date. 
 Yeah, but those websites Are just so-- 
 Hello? 
 Stephanie. 
 Stephanie-- 
 No, I will not speak to your unicorn. 
 Because he's not real. 
 That website again? 
 Hey, Shannon. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So, listen, you guys wanna be on the next "ICARLY"? 
 Definitely. 
 Oh my god. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Well, let's just say One of you is gonna win a date With an awesome guy. 
 Freddie? 
 I said "awesome guy," Not "ridiculous goob." 
 I think Freddie is cute and smart. 
 Okay, what'd you eat for breakfast? 
 A big bowl of crazy flakes? 
 There's my raspberry Soccer ball. 
 And speaking' of crazy flakes, It's you. 
 Hello there. 
 My name is Spencer Shay. 
 Hello. 
 I've never used an internet dating service before, But my sister told me about this one, Whynotdateme.com. 
 So, why not date me? 
 I enjoy people. 
 What are you doing? 
 Making a video for whynotdateme.com. 
 Give me the remote. 
 What's wrong? 
 You're not being you. 
 You gotta be looser. 
 How do I not look-- 
 Your shirt should be out, These buttons should be undone, And your hair needs some of this. 
 There. 
 What did you put in your hair? 
 Chicken fat. 
 Oh my god. 
 Gibby, ready to play "I win a date"? 
 Shannon's really in there? 
 Right through that door. 
 Man, this is intense. 
 Just remember, All your voices are gonna be electronically disguised. 
 Why? 
 To keep your identities a mystery. 
 Then how will I know which one is Shannon? 
 She'll be girl number-- 
 You can't just tell him. 
 We have to keep the game real and fair. 
 But what if I don't pick Shannon? 
 Listen; there'll be three girls out there. 
 Girl number one, Girl number two, And girl number three. 
 But how will I know which one is Shannon?

 That's all you have two-- 
 Two-- 
 do. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, you guys Better come in here. 
 Be right back. 
 What? 
 What's up? 
 Celine and Julia Aren't coming. 
 What? 
 Why aren't they coming? 
 They got tickets To see "girly cow on ice." 
 Why is it that whenever There's a popular tv show, They just gotta go Put it on ice? 
 Guys, we have seven minutes To figure out How we're gonna play "i win a date"
