 No. 
 Why not? 
 I'm really good at it. 
 Don't you ever say that again? 
 We're going home right now. 
 No. 
 Fredward Benson. 
 Give me one good reason why I shouldn't be allowed to fence. 
 The fencing' Bensons. 
 The fencing' Bensons. 
 Sit down, Freddie. 
 I never wanted you to know. 
 What? 
 Your great grandfather, long before you were born, He led a troop Called the fencing' Bensons. 
 They performed with the tingling brothers Circus. 
 It was him, his brother, and their seven cousins, They were gifted fencers, wildly popular. 
 The tingling brothers? 
 Yes. 
 Your great grandfather was a master at fencing. 
 But he became obsessed with it. 
 He forced my my father to fence. 
 And later, my father made me. fencing's in our blood, Freddie. 
 And I never wanted you to become obsessed like our ancestors. 
 Ah, come on. 
 It's true. 
 Right. 
 You know, my great grandfather was a magical penguin. 
 His name was Pingo. 
 Mom, not letting me fence is bad enough. 
 I can't believe you'd make up such an insane lie. 
 I will not stand here and be called a liar by my own son, Or you, sassy pants. 
 Mom, you let me fence against Doug Toder tonight Or else-- 
 Or else what. 
 I'll never make another puzzle with you again. 
 Freddie Mean it, mom. 
 What's in that first aid kit, an ambulance? 
 Just everything I need in case Freddie gets hurt. 
 He will be fine. 
 You better hope so, missy. 
 Well. 
 You boys ready? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You're going down, Fredward. 
 Ready.
