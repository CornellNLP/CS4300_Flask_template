 Someone snuck into my locker yesterday and stole My fruit-scented markers. 
 So the next time someone breaks in, It'll trigger this mechanism Which causes this camera to snap A picture of the thief,so I'll know that you took my markers .

 Hey, Gibby, go ask Mr. Palladino to staple those together. 
 What for? 
 Just do it!

 I'm sorry, Gibby. I can't find the stapler. 
 That's right, cause I took it. 
 Ah, yes.

 The sooner we start, the sooner we finish. 
 So everybody, let's take your seats.

 Absolutely not. 
 An on-the-job accident means the school has to give me a two Month paid vacation while I recover. Bye!

 Out of the way! 
 Who knew getting in trouble would be so impossible. 
 I gotta give you credit, Sam. You make it look easy. 
 Years of practice.
