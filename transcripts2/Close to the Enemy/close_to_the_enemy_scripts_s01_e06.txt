 Your German worked with V-2 rockets. 
 He has lied to you about everything. 
 I was never involved in ordering executions. 
 Alex came rushing back from work at lunchtime today. 
 I don't think he knows. Do you think he does? 
 It's dynamite. Everything is there. 
 The people that turned down the chance of getting rid of Hitler in 1938. 
 Are you going to make this all public? 
 Yes. 
 At a Foreign Office dinner they're giving in my honour. 
 You going to change everything? People spouting poetry. 
 I'm getting married. 
 Married? 
 Yes! 
 We haven't told anybody so far. 
 I dropped by to say hello, and I also thought that it was time to tell the world about how we're giving Nazis a night out, and lovely new lives if we think they're worth it. 
 I'm pretty sure people would be very interested to hear about that. 
 [LOUD CHATTER] 
 And now, we have the chance to hear some music. 
 A world première, in fact! 
 Mr Callum Ferguson is going to play his latest composition. 
 Callum? 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 I have never been so terrified. 
 Fighting in Normandy was nothing compared to this! 
 [SOULFUL MUSIC STARTS] 
 [DOOR SLAMS] 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 No need to apologise. I am rather in the way. 
 I might have guessed that'd happen! 
 That's my brother playing! 
 You can tell from up here? 
 Yes, I know that tune. 
 Callum always tries out his new pieces on me, since we were little. 
 Ah, so you're the policeman's brother? 
 I'm very interested to meet you. 
 Yes, I'm Victor, and I guess you're the perfume lady? 
 I am, yes. 
 Very definitely the perfume lady. 
 Well, I won't stop, though. 
 Can't you? Even for a moment? 
 No, there are people looking for me, and I have much to do. 
 And what's more, I've just realised something. 
 What have you realised? 
 How everybody is moving on. 
 And that's just how it's going to be now. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I'm not sure... where I fit in at all, really. 
 Well, if it's any comfort, that makes two of us. 
 Me sitting here on the landing, too nervous to go downstairs. 
 And me charging about. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [MUSIC ENDS] 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 Well... 
 I take it all back. This man has a use after all! 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 And the other thing I take back, I thought tonight was going to be a disaster! 
 But it hasn't been that at all, has it? 
 It's dangerously close to being a success! 
 [FAST MUSIC STARTS UP] 
 [WOMAN GASPS] 
 Mr Ferguson? 
 Are you dining with us this evening? 
 Yes. Yes, I am. 
 I think I'll have the soup. 
 And then the pork served with some boiled potatoes and cabbage. 
 Can you do the special cabbage? 
 Mr Ferguson... 
 No, I will have the special cabbage! 
 Is that all right?! 
 Impertinent. 
 Mr Ferguson! 
 Mr Ferguson? 
 I really must insist. You must see the doctor. 
 For the sake of the other guests, I must insist. 
 Excuse me, please. 
 Please leave us, thank you. 
 What's the matter, Victor? 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 You're missing your evening. 
 Don't worry, they can manage without me. 
 I'm not sure... 
 I'm not sure I can manage, though, not tonight... not any more. 
 I don't want to cry all over you again. 
 [ECHOING VOICES] 
 It's always a much better view like that. 
 So you say each time. 
 Really? How many times have you been this week? 
 I've been almost every day this week. 
 I've been almost every day for the last six weeks, actually! 
 What dedication! 
 It's been a bit of a blur with all the pills. 
 Aren't you neglecting the German, then? 
 No, no, his work's nearly there. 
 You look fantastically smart today! 
 Do you always look like this when you visit the loony ward? 
 You're not in a loony ward, you're in a psychiatric ward, and you're going to be able to leave soon. 
 I'm locked up, Callum. 
 But at least I've not got electrodes poking out of my head, thanks to you, and I'm grateful. 
 Today, my mind is just wonderfully clear. 
 That's good because I have a surprise for you today. 
 I brought some visitors. 
 Visitors? 
 Yeah. 
 Hello, Victor. You look so much better! 
 Very good to see you, Victor. 
 I brought you some chocolate. 
 Really good dark chocolate, don't ask me how I got it! 
 Thank you. 
 This can't be all for me, you looking like this? 
 Well, it's not entirely for you, I'll admit. 
 We're going to a rather formal cricket match to watch Alex play. 
 The Foreign Office versus the Home Office. 
 That explains it. I thought you were going to a wedding! 
 Talking of weddings, have you heard the news? 
 The German is getting married! 
 He's getting married?! 
 Yes, he's marrying the young waitress from the hotel, Anna. 
 Isn't that amazing?! 
 We're going to the engagement party very soon. 
 [LIGHT APPLAUSE] 
 Ah, Rupert. 
 Good afternoon. 
 It's going well? 
 Yes, very well. 
 Good afternoon, sir. Good luck. 
 The chief. 
 I have to say, you're very calm for someone's who's about to go in. 
 I'm totally calm, yes. 
 Altogether, in fact. 
 It makes such a difference she's happy. 
 I had no idea what an avalanche of work was going to hit me at the FO, all these worries about if the Russians get the bomb, and whether we should strike at them first. 
 I'm so pleased her evenings of music and poetry have proved such a success. 
 It was your idea, Alex. 
 For her to do more at the hotel. 
 It was, but you've encouraged her. 
 And for that I'm grateful. 
 Looks like you're in. 
 So he's off! 
 Talking of bombs going off, I've been given a date for my party. 
 My dinner at the FO. 
 Oh, at last. That's terrific. 
 It's only just occurred to me I don't know why I didn't think of it before but Alex he's not involved, is he? 
 No. No, not Alex. 
 But there are people here who were very involved. 
 [INAUDIBLE] 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 I knew he'd be good! 
 The German is getting married. 
 The German is getting married. 
 The German is getting married. 
 What is it, Victor? 
 Don't you start working yourself up. 
 The German is getting married. It's not right. 
 It's not right that he's getting married. It's not right. 
 The German is getting married. 
 That's the way, Lombard! 
 Good show, Alex. 
 It's amazing. I think he's going to score 100 runs. 
 I hope he's not trying to prove something to us, because he knows I can't play cricket. 
 So there  is  something you can't do! 
 Alex is going back to Washington for a few weeks on Saturday. 
 He is? 
 You know, he is definitely batting as if he knows something about us. 
 He doesn't know. I'd be able to tell if he did. 
 Good shot. 
 I thought maybe we could go away somewhere. 
 As a last sort of... 
 Last? Why last? 
 Because if we don't stop, he will find out, and I don't want that, not at all. 
 [CALLUM SCOFFS] 
 Don't argue with me, Callum. 
 Very soon, you and I will have to start new lives, very different to this. 
 We can't keep putting it off. 
 Now, Victor, it is way past bedtime. 
 Time for you... 
 The German is getting married. 
 Victor! 
 Really! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I shouldn't have done that. 
 I'm... I am so very sorry. 
 You've got a picture up of the b*st*rd, I see. 
 Captain Ferguson! Yes, I have. 
 I like to have photographs of all my targets. 
 So how is your drinking companion? 
 The torturer? 
 She's still very quiet. 
 Sometimes, it seems I'm making progress, but I'm not really. 
 Maybe it's because I can't stop myself thinking about what she's done. 
 Time is running out. 
 The trial is very soon. 
 Have you thought about taking her home for a meal? 
 No, I haven't thought about that, surprisingly! 
 It's not a good idea. Cooking is not my strong suit. 
 She's not going to be thinking about your cooking. 
 Well, anyway, it's just a thought. 
 Are you OK? Why are you wearing gloves? 
 Because they won't let us wear anything with our pyjamas, unless we say we're cold. 
 Of course, I'm boiling now! 
 I know where they keep the clothes hidden, though. 
 Victor, the German is having his party this evening to celebrate his engagement to Anna, and I am going to have to go. 
 No. 
 So I want you to know... 
 It's not right, Callum, that he should have a lovely new life. 
 I want you to know that I've now had his records checked in Germany, and there is no evidence of war crimes. 
 Well, they haven't looked. You haven't looked. 
 You must stop worrying about this, Victor. 
 I "borrowed" one of the cakes they've made for the party this evening. 
 It's not too early for cake today, is it? 
 Well, looking at that, I think I can certainly make an exception. 
 Now, let's see what an RAF cake tastes like. 
 Mm. 
 Tell me, Mr Lindsay-Jones, why are you helping the policeman? 
 Because I like him. 
 And because he did me a very big favour. 
 Yes. I see. 
 Because of the war, we all have to conceal our real reasons, don't we? 
 Just in case. 
 That's very true. 
 True of me, anyway. 
 [MAN SPLUTTERS] 
 Kate, quickly! 
 Fetch help! 
 [MAN GROANS AND SHOUTS] 
 [CLATTERING] 
 [TRUMPET PLAYS] 
 [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 I'll be right outside in the car, Miss Griffiths, with the driver, all the time, in case you need me. 
 [CORK POPS] 
 [GLASSES CLINK] 
 Been waiting for me, Bella? 
 It's lucky Mrs Tooley keeps the spare key in the same place. 
 [DOG GROWLS] 
 Shh. 
 [DOG WHIMPERS] 
 Shh. 
 You look at me all the time. 
 Those little looks. 
 Do I? 
 I'm sorry. 
 What if I did that to you? 
 You're quite right. Forgive me. 
 The food is good. Let's just eat the food. 
 Your dad has surprised us all, honey. 
 And I think it's wonderful. 
 Everybody coming together. 
 That's the way it should be. 
 [INAUDIBLE] 
 Tomorrow, we'll go? 
 Yes, we will. 
 [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 Government? Best come in, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 May I take your hat? 
 No, no, that's quite all right, thank you. 
 I thought Mr Ferguson was meant to be in hospital, but now he's here. 
 Nobody called me. 
 Victor? 
 I'm Geoffrey Salter. 
 I'm a colleague of your brother's. 
 Mr Salter. 
 Ah, yes, he doesn't like you. 
 I'm sure that's true. 
 On the other hand, I am surprisingly fond of your brother. 
 And that is why I'm here. 
 You're here because you like my brother? 
 I don't think so. 
 I know a lot about your brother. 
 Everything there is to know, in fact. 
 And whatever else you say about him, he is a patriot. 
 That is why I like him, and that is why I am here. 
 You will have to explain that to me. 
 You've taken some files that don't belong to you, Victor, which Miss Griffiths now has. 
 You have also escaped from the psychiatric ward, where you were being held for your own safety. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I am surprised that they haven't come to look for me yet. 
 Unless you... 
 No. 
 No, that's not my business. 
 In fact, I want to give you the chance to consider what I have to say all on your own. 
 Victor, you have gone round boasting you will tell the world about what's happening to the ex-Nazis who are helping us, how we're giving them new identities. 
 You mustn't do that, Victor, any more, ever again. 
 It will make all our lives more difficult. 
 But shall I tell you what it really means? 
 It will destroy your brother, his career, his prospects, even endanger his life, for failing to control you. 
 And if that happens... there will be only one person to blame. 
 I couldn't...? 
 Yes? 
 I couldn't stay a little longer? 
 Not for the night, of course, but just sit here, for a moment longer? 
 Of course. 
 It is so kind of you to walk me to the bus stop, Mrs Tooley. 
 I'm going to miss your dog, you know. 
 I'm going back to the hospital, I promise. 
 And once I'm on the bus, I'll be OK. 
 [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] 
 Mr Ferguson! 
 What are doing here, Mr Ferguson? 
 Your brother's not here. 
 And no, I don't know where he's gone. 
 Morning, gentlemen! 
 Tell me, who's the worst tipper amongst all the people you drive? 
 [CHAUFFEURS CHUCKLE] 
 The blue one! 
 Yeah. 
 That's about right, yeah. 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 Oi! Oi! Oi! Come back here! 
 We'd like a double room for one night, please. 
 [CLOCK CHIMES] 
 They seem to hate us! 
 They sense danger. 
 And love. 
 You signed your real name. 
 I had to. 
 I might get called by somebody from the base. 
 No, you're not taking any calls here. 
 None at all. 
 It's bad enough that you've chosen a hotel so close to the base. 
 You've got to let your work go for a moment, Cal. 
 You're like one of your machines, those engines, that can never be... 
 That can't be stopped? 
 Mm. 
 I'm Captain Ferguson's brother. 
 I need to see him. I need to see him now! 
 We haven't see him today. He's not here. 
 Well, then, get Mr Dieter Koehler. It's extremely urgent. 
 [BOTH LAUGHING BED CREAKS] 
 God, it makes a noise! 
 They'll all be listening. 
 There'll be a queue in the passage! 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 It's so noisy! 
 I need my brother. I've got something to tell him. 
 I don't have an address for where he is. 
 Well, you must be able to contact him in some way. 
 In case there's an emergency. You must! 
 I have just a telephone number. 
 [WOMAN]: Mr Ferguson, a telephone call. 
 You're not going to answer that? 
 Callum! 
 Come on. Come on! 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello? 
 Cal! 
 Cal, there you are. 
 I need to say something to you. 
 Victor, what is it? Where are you? 
 Are you at the hospital? 
 No, I couldn't stay, there was this nurse, and I did something wrong. 
 Anyway, I've done worse things. Bad things. 
 I know I shouldn't have said what I did about your work, so you must forgive me. 
 Victor, what is this? Where are you? 
 I found some evidence. The real evidence now. 
 You must read it. It was all true, about Dieter, what I said! 
 And I knew it was, but anyway, that doesn't matter now... 
 Victor, you must tell me exactly where you are. 
 All right? I'll come and find you. 
 No, no, no. They came to see me. 
 No, they wouldn't like that. 
 Cal, I know that I have done the wrong thing, OK? 
 And I am not worth it. I'm really not.... 
 I'm not worth destroying everything for you. 
 Who came to see you? 
 If they've threatened you, I will kill them. 
 I will f*cking kill them. Now, where are you?! 
 Somewhere with a pond. Little Rooting,  or Great Rooting, Tiny Rooting, I... 
 I stole a blue Rolls, Cal. 
 If you're going to steal a car, it's-it's the car to steal, don't you think? 
 It's a great car! Erm... 
 I have to go now, Cal, there are people watching. 
 No, no, no, no, no, Victor, you don't move, you stay there. 
 Whatever you do, all right, you don't move. I'm coming to get you. 
 No, better you don't, Cal. 
 I don't need you to come. 
 All right, I  am  coming to get you. 
 You have to stay exactly where you are. 
 
 
 
 Victor? Victor? Victor! 
 I'll come with you, Cal. 
 Just stay there! 
 Victor! 
 Victor! 
 Victor! Oh, God, no, please. 
 No, Victor! Please, no! 
 Can you hear me? Huh? 
 Can you hear me? 
 Victor! 
 Come on, in you go. That's it, Victor, that's it. 
 [WHIRRING] 
 How is he? 
 How is he now? 
 I'm waiting to hear. 
 Did somebody attack him? What happened, Callum? 
 I think I know exactly what happened. 
 Forgive me. 
 No... 
 No, there's nothing to forgive you for. 
 I made such a mess of it. 
 I bungled it. 
 Trying to cut one's own throat... not the best way. 
 Well, luckily, probably not. 
 But you were driven to it. They threatened you. 
 But don't worry... I will take care of it, in a way that they will not forget. 
 How are you, Victor? 
 Can you hear me? 
 [ENGINE WHIRS] 
 [WHIRRING INTENSIFIES] 
 [INDISTINCT SHOUTS] 
 Stop it! Stop it! 
 It should not be vibrating like that. Stop it! 
 I'm sorry, gentlemen. This should not be happening. 
 It'll just take a little adjustment. 
 We need to rebalance the components. 
 That is all it will take. Really, I promise, I promise. 
 You won't be seeing them again. 
 They've been reassigned to some godforsaken place in Germany. 
 So, don't worry about them, worry about this, Ferguson... the engine's not ready. 
 I saw that, sir. 
 It's very simple... if we fall behind the Americans and the Russians, if we can't fly as fast, we lose the next war. 
 Victor, my dear boy. 
 How are you feeling? 
 I brought these because I got it into my head that something really colourful would be best. 
 What I really want... is another huge bar of chocolate. 
 I can't believe that just happened. In front of all of them. 
 We will take it apart and see why it's happening, and then stop it happening. 
 We are able to do this, Rita. 
 We're still going to beat the Americans. 
 Is that how you want it? 
 Yes, thank you. 
 With so many buildings destroyed round here, the sun is so bright! 
 Too bright, sometimes. 
 Now, tell me... is he better? 
 Is the brother better? 
 It's hard to tell yet. A little, yes. 
 And they're keeping a watch on him, so he doesn't try to do it again? 
 I'm sure they are. 
 Callum is seeing to everything. He always does. 
 That boy must not be left alone. 
 He won't be. 
 Ah, the two women together! 
 Yes, you've managed to introduce us, Victor. 
 I brought you something. 
 Two things, actually. 
 It took a lot of coupons, but here's another, rather smaller, bar of chocolate. 
 Some milk chocolate. At last! 
 Not that the other one isn't nice, but... 
 I thought this might interest you too. 
 It's rather silly, but I brought it anyway. 
 It's all the beetles that crawled out of the files you found. 
 That's terrific. 
 Blimey, that's a lot! 
 You're right, it really appeals to me, even if they are all dead. 
 [VICTOR LAUGHS] 
 They'll probably take it away, though. 
 And, Victor, I am determined to get a result with Fraulein Mentz, who I found out about because of the files. 
 So, are you in love with Callum? 
 And is he in love with you? 
 Victor! 
 Excuse me. I have to get back to work. 
 Oh, no, don't go, please! 
 No, no, it's a long journey. I ought to go. 
 But I'll be back again, very soon. 
 She's run away just because I asked a perfectly sensible question. 
 You made her run away. 
 So aren't you going to give me an answer? 
 Why do you even ask? 
 Because I know my brother. 
 This is not the place, Victor. 
 That's a very disappointing reply. I thought we were friends. 
 We are friends. 
 Well, whether you are or you aren't in love with each other, you must promise me that you'll keep a close eye on him. 
 He blames the Secret Service for me being like this, and he may try to take certain actions because of that. 
 What kind of actions? 
 You must remember the war messed him up just as much as it did me. 
 Maybe more. 
 Who's messed up? 
 Me, of course. It's always me! 
 So, what was he saying to you? 
 That you're as much scarred by the war as he is. 
 Well, that's rubbish. 
 Is it? 
 You've never talked to me about it. 
 About the fighting in Normandy, everything that you went through So? Who talks about the war? Nobody does. 
 Not to people that weren't there, anyway. 
 Remember, Victor is full of medication. 
 Not everything he says is to be taken literally. 
 Your brother has tried to take his own life, but everything is fine? 
 You're totally calm and relaxed, are you, Callum? 
 Is that what you're telling me? 
 I'm as calm as I have been for a long time, without a doubt. 
 Somebody has to be. 
 Don't believe Victor. 
 And as these are our last weeks together... well, then, you won't have to worry about me any more, will you? 
 [PIANO PLAYS SOFTLY] 
 [LOW MURMUR OF CONVERSATION] 
 Would you like to follow me? This way, ladies. 
 I'm sorry I'm so very late. 
 Don't worry, you're very busy, I know... getting the engine ready. 
 Yeah. 
 I took the liberty of ordering. 
 I thought we could see if the ice cream has improved here. 
 Excellent. What better way to take time off work than to have a day in London, and eat an ice cream with you? 
 Yes. 
 Your ice cream, sir. 
 And there's a little fresh fruit. 
 It's an extra on the side. 
 Some people like to mix it in with their vanilla ices. 
 There's no additional charge. 
 What a good idea! 
 How did you think of that? 
 May I? 
 I think you'll find that  this  is the file. 
 Another of Victor's files? 
 Eight different witness statements. 
 All identifying you. 
 [SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYS] 
 You're going to tell me that they're all a case of mistaken identity, are you? 
 No. 
 I'm not saying that. 
 People died. 
 There were acts of sabotage, which were punishable by death, and I saw people executed, yes. 
 Did I encourage them to be carried out? Executed? 
 Well, I certainly didn't stop them. 
 It seems extraordinary thinking about this now, with ice cream, and the ladies here. 
 What really went on... 
 People were hanging from hooks. 
 [CREAKING] 
 [WHIMPERING] 
 Sitting here, it is almost unimaginable that it happened so recently. 
 I always knew you would find out in the end. 
 I thought it might be right in the beginning that is why I was so keen to get back to Germany and when you did ask... 
 I just couldn't tell you. 
 But you and I, Callum... we have come so far in such a short time. 
 I'm not going to insult your intelligence by saying that we are on the same side now, and that there is a new enemy that we have to defeat together. 
 Except I've just said it. 
 Is everything all right, gentlemen? 
 Any teas or coffees to go with your ice creams? 
 No. Thank you, everything is fine. 
 I have no excuse. 
 Except to say, of course, that we were at war, which is no excuse. 
 And the work was everything. 
 One is blinded. 
 What do we do now, Callum? 
 We were friends. 
 We are friends. 
 Yes, we are. 
 Right now, of course, my work is so very close, so what is your plan? 
 The Government will see to it that you can finish your work, and that you're immune from prosecution. 
 But you are not saying anything, about what I've just told you? 
 No. 
 I hardly dare ask this, but are you still going to come to the wedding? 
 Absolutely. 
 I've got a few very busy days ahead. 
 It's Harold's party at the Foreign Office, and then your wedding at the end of the week. 
 That's two occasions I couldn't possibly miss. 
 Harold, you're all dressed up! 
 I am. Thank you for letting me do this. 
 Well, it's not going to be possible soon. They're moving out. 
 All being well, they've stopped using this for training. 
 Sniper training. 
 [SHOUTING]: Anybody up there? 
 Well, that's one way of getting rid of my nerves for tomorrow. 
 A bullet between the eyes! 
 How nervous are you? 
 Fairly terrified. 
 A room completely packed with people I know, and I'll be attacking them all. 
 I came here to get some strength. 
 Well, we both might need some strength, in fact. 
 You as well? Why? What are you planning? 
 I can't tell you that. 
 This place is very important to me. 
 Not just because it was the last time I ever went to a party with my wife, but... 
 I keep coming back here in my dreams. 
 Almost every night recently. 
 There was beauty. 
 And a terrible ignorance. 
 Our complacency seems so shocking now. 
 [ENGINE REVS] 
 And the extraordinary mistakes that nobody has owned up to. 
 Oh, I know! 
 Like letting the bloody jet engine go! 
 And I was there. You know, I was working on it before the war, when Mr Whittle needed just five pounds to renew his patent. 
 Just five pounds. 
 But he couldn't afford it, and the Government wouldn't give it to him, wouldn't give him five f*cking pounds, and we lost the jet engine! 
 What a p... what a price we paid for that! 
 It's unbelievable, the incompetent bastards, just like your incompetent bastards that failed to back the coup against Hitler, that could have prevented the entire f*cking war! 
 Well, their time has come. 
 We are their nemesis, Harold. 
 Let's hope so. 
 They've certainly gone unpunished so far. 
 And you'll manage fine tomorrow. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 So there you are! 
 Here I am, yes. 
 I've been neglectful, and I'm sorry. 
 Don't be stupid. Your brother has been very ill... of course you've had better things to do. 
 I just wanted to know how he is. 
 He's getting better. 
 His wounds are healing, but he's lost a lot of blood. 
 What really happened to him? 
 Well, I'm not sure of the facts, but whatever it was, it was caused by him being put under terrible pressure by a member of the Secret Service. 
 Why would they do that? 
 I'm sorry, I'm asking a lot of questions. 
 No, that's OK. 
 Because he was proving a nuisance. 
 Of course, their actions have to be answered. 
 How? I'm sorry, I'm doing it again. 
 I don't know why I think I have a right to know, because I don't. 
 I only met him for a couple of minutes. 
 That's all Victor needs to make an impression. 
 I have a plan... but for the moment, it's... it's private. 
 Of course. 
 Quite right. 
 I was going to suggest I gave you the formula today, and sign the papers. 
 But, clearly, this is not the right moment, when you have so much on your mind. 
 I have a little on my mind, yes. 
 [HUM OF CONVERSATION] 
 Callum, I'm here! 
 I made it back from Washington just in time. 
 I wasn't going to miss this... Harold being honoured. 
 It's going to be a splendid night! 
 It is. 
 Oh, rare sighting of the chief. 
 Do excuse me. 
 Of course. 
 So, he's back. 
 Yes. For quite a while, anyway. 
 So that really was our last time together? 
 Callum, I hardly think that this is the place. 
 It's fine. 
 It doesn't matter anyway. 
 I have other plans. 
 What's that mean? 
 It means exactly that. 
 Just thought I'd fortify myself. 
 Though, oddly enough, I find I'm quite calm, and really rather excited. 
 My journalist friend. 
 Even he doesn't know what's coming. 
 I'm going to tell the truth about the coup against Hitler that never happened, and they have no idea. 
 Well, remember, no oysters before the speech, Harold. 
 Oh, certainly not. 
 I will be oyster free. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, it's long overdue, of course, that we're all gathered here to honour Harold Lindsay-Jones and his many years of service, but now that we are finally here, we're doing it in exactly the way Harold wants, which is totally appropriate. 
 At his favourite place in the world, his beloved club, and having the speeches before the dinner, rather than after as is customary, because Harold says he wanted all the suspense out of the way. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Now, of course, Harold was famous to all of us for knowing exactly what people were thinking, even the most inscrutable the French, the Americans, above all, the Germans. 
 He invariably had an insight into other people's minds, which makes tonight a little alarming. 
 Does he know what we're all thinking now? 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Well, if he does, he will know that we're full of admiration, and gratitude, and, of course, friendship. 
 So, now, Harold, I'm going to hand over to you. 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 [FEEDBACK] 
 Ah, it's working, so that's a very good start! 
 My friends, this is a very important moment for me, in all sorts of ways, and you'll forgive me, because to help me through these nervous opening moments, I've brought along a couple of props. 
 A golden box, with a couple of little stories in it, and first out is this. 
 A scrap of paper. And what is it? 
 It's a film review, written by Winston Churchill, of Mr Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, and it is exceedingly short. 
 But let me paint the picture. 
 [MUFFLED]: There was a film show, almost every night... 
 I'm sorry I'm so late. 
 I'm here for the gala dinner for Mr Lindsay-Jones. 
 Your name? 
 It's Lucy Lindsay-Jones. 
 I'm his niece. 
 Please hurry. 
 Please, hurry! 
 Your name's not here. 
 What do you mean? It's got to be there. 
 I can't miss it. You've got to let me in. 
 Your name is not here, and, therefore, I cannot let you in. 
 "Rubbish, rubbish, bloody rubbish." 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 Winston may have been no film critic, but what a man to work for! 
 Hear, hear. 
 Glorious! 
 He would stomp along the corridors of Chequers at night, yelling "This unnecessary war! This completely unnecessary war!" 
 But more of that in a moment. 
 And that brings me to my second exhibit... this key. 
 Lord Halifax, our old boss... his private key. 
 Now, by the way, he's completely relaxed about me telling you this. 
 This key was given to him by the Queen, to the garden at Buckingham Palace. 
 Miss! 
 This key opened a special door, which let him use the lovely summer house whenever he wanted. 
 A place for him to retreat to in those terrifying days after the invasion of Norway, when we all thought he would become Prime Minister. 
 How did I end up with this key? 
 It was a gift from His Lordship, because it doesn't work any more. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 A memento of that extraordinary time, when we were all holding our breath to see who would become the next Prime Minister. 
 When so many of us at the Foreign Office, myself included, I must admit, were saying "Don't let it be Churchill! 
 "Please, whatever happens, let it not be Winston," until we got to know him. 
 Lucy, there you are. 
 They won't let me in! 
 That's ridiculous. 
 Her uncle, who also happens to be her guardian, is making a very important speech. 
 She can't possibly miss that. 
 You will let her in immediately. 
 And that brings me to the heart of what I want to say. 
 We fought that "unnecessary war". 
 What did Churchill mean by that? 
 How was it "unnecessary"? 
 He meant, of course, there were opportunities, in the events leading up to the war, when different decisions could have been made. 
 When war itself might have been prevented. 
 And we all know there were moments like that. 
 Some better known than others. 
 Some still... some still to be uncovered. 
 But in the end, we all did what we had to. 
 We went on a momentous and startling journey together, terrifying, sometimes exhilarating, sometimes tragic. 
 And I want to thank you all for your tremendous support during that time, and for this marvellous dinner tonight. 
 Thank you to all of you. Thank you very much. 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 You're looking much better, Victor. 
 They've sent for some brain doctors, to interrogate me. 
 An inquisition! 
 And, if I pass, if they conclude I'm not a lunatic, then I might be free to go soon. 
 Well, that's tremendous. 
 Well, if they don't lock me up for stealing the Rolls. 
 And how are you? 
 Have you got the girl in the green coat to agree to give evidence yet? 
 The Green Torturer? 
 No, not yet. 
 I've tried everything I can think of, and everything Callum suggested as well. 
 Well, take her to your favourite place in the world. 
 Or in London, at any rate. Your special place. 
 I don't have a favourite place. 
 Well, you ought to. 
 Mine's a bombed church called St Mildred's. 
 I'll think about it. 
 Be even bolder than Callum, Kathy. 
 He is a genius, of course, at making the enemy feel at home, but he's not nearly so good at looking after himself. 
 He thinks he's in control all the time, but he isn't. 
 I'm really quite worried about him. 
 The last person that needs worrying about is Callum! 
 Your brother's right... we underestimate chickens. 
 They can be quite formidable, when they choose. 
 To chicken out of something... that's an unfair expression. 
 Unfair on them. 
 I'm sure it is. 
 I am so very sorry, Callum. 
 You can do it again. 
 It doesn't have to be at your farewell party. 
 We could find an easier moment. 
 You didn't read this document, did you? 
 The one you "borrowed" from the Foreign Office. 
 The memo of that crucial meeting. 
 I didn't read it, no. 
 I just glanced at it. 
 Then you missed the most vital thing, then, didn't you? 
 I was going use it to put it under their eggs in the hut there, but before I do, take a look at the top. 
 Where it says who was present at that meeting. 
 It was me that told them not to do anything. 
 It was my advice that meant we didn't back the coup against Hitler. 
 Not just me, of course, but I was, "the man who knew what foreigners were thinking". 
 My contribution was crucial. 
 So this whole plan...? 
 You just wanted to get hold of the file... 
 To cover up my tracks, yes. 
 So people wouldn't know about the biggest mistake of my life. 
 That it was my advice... that these senior, well-intentioned Germans were not serious people. 
 Posterity would never know it was me. 
 That was my initial idea, Callum... to bury the truth. 
 I see. 
 Then... over the last few months, as I got to know you well, you encouraged me, you made me bolder. 
 I decided I was going to make the whole thing public. 
 My contribution, the dramatic failure of the Foreign Office to seize the chance, the whole story. 
 I really meant to. 
 I just wasn't brave enough. 
 And seeing Lucy there especially. 
 I thought she was away visiting friends. 
 I didn't expect her to come. 
 And all those faces looking at me. 
 I was afraid. 
 I hate to think what you must feel about me, Callum. 
 Don't worry yourself so much, Harold. 
 That still leaves me. 
 I can do something. 
 Ah, we're back staying here, my friend, and two days early! 
 But there's the rehearsal tomorrow, and, of course, we wanted to make sure to be on time for the ceremony. 
 And to see the hotel again. 
 Yes, she's grown to love it here. 
 I promised she could play outside for once, on the bombsite. 
 Meanwhile, I'm continuing to work right up to the last minute. 
 Gentlemen.
