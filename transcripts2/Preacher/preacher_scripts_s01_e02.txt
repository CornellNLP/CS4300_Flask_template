The Lord All Powerful, he's took time out of his busy schedule, sit behind his pearly, little desk there, and gone, "Right, angels, here's my plan for Jesse Custer." That's right. And what is it, then? Be here. Work hard, help others, preach the Gospel. Be one of the good guys. Do you know what? He has a plan for me, too. I'm sure He does. His plan for me is to let you know that his plan for you is the dumbest, most boring plan he's ever come up with. So selfishness... that's your answer. Just run around, do whatever whenever you want. What kind of a life is that? An honest one. [Laughs derisively] "Honest"? Passing the hat for your sick grandmother back home? Now, you just hang on a minute. She's not me grandmother, but she's me Granny B., and she's had a series of intest... Stealing church wine? That's not fair. I was gonna pay that back. I'm sure that's the least of what you done.

Loser is... all right. Look, I'm just sayin', boring's not the worst thing a person can be, Cassidy. [Exhales] I think you're wrong. I think boring's the worst. [Chuckles] [Chuckles] I've been wonderin' who taught you how to fight like that. Was that your dad? To fight? No, that was someone else. Oh. There's a tale to be told there, I think. Why we always talking about me? What's your story, Cassidy? No, it's pretty typical, really. I am 119-year-old vampire from Dublin City. [Chuckles] And I'm currently on the run from a group of vampire-hunting religious vigilantes who keep tracking me down somehow. What else? I'm a right-handed Sagittarius. I love Chinese food. I've never seen the Pacific Ocean. And I think that "The Big Lebowski's" overrated. Vampire, huh? [Clicks tongue] Sounds like fun. Can be. Sometimes. 
 
 Whatcha got there? Mnh-mnh. [Swallows] No. Let me see that. No, I shan't. It's too potent for ya. Leave it out. Give it. After a sip of this, you're not going to feel like one of the "good guys," all right? So just... Give me that! All right, all right. Don't spill it! Don't spill it! [Sighs] [Sniffs] That's a combination of rubbing alcohol, coffee-machine descaler, and a bit of shite I found dripping out the back of the air-conditioning unit.
