 I mean, I'm... 
 I'm not a nut job, right? 
 It was a normal Sunday,  and I always eat toast on Sunday. 
 I mean, sometimes a bagel, but usually toast. 
 So, anyway, this Sunday, I'm just about  to put my strawberry jam on my toast...

 I think he's gonna make it. 
 That's great, Cass. 
 Yeah. 
 Looks like we didn't need your help after all. 
 Right there, watching me... 
 So, what, are we looking for God on YouTube now? 
 Is that what it's come to? 
 God is missing, Cass. 
 It's important. 
 Without God, there's no structure. 
 No order. 
 With no one at the wheel, we hit the rocks, and it's... 
 It's chaos.

 Sure.

 Yeah, so, it took three from a 44. 
 But you know what...

 That's the power I've been talking about. 
 He just said "Go to sleep," and she went to sleep,  just like that. 
 People do whatever he says.

 And they opened it just for you. 
 My father told me you were very important. 
 Right? 
 Is what right? 
 That you're important... 
 Your job. 
 Yes, I suppose that's true. 
 You're not satisfied with it? 
 I work for the most powerful organization in the world... 
 Agents in 113 countries ready to do my bidding  at a moment's notice. 
 Impressive. 
 And yet...? 
 And yet... 
 [Sighs] 
 And yet, I have been feeling a little... 
 disenchanted lately. 
 Hmm. 
 I was like you once... 
 Looking for sense of purpose and meaning. 
 On the surface, I had it all, but... 
 my life was like a jigsaw puzzle with one missing piece,  one vital piece. 
 I traveled, volunteered. 
 And then, one night, in a hospital in the inner city,  Stephen walked into my life. 
 He was 8 years old, tears in his eyes. 
 His mama was a crack addict,  his daddy was a deadbeat,  and he was developmentally challenged. 
 For months, all I saw was his tears. 
 But then, one day, I reached into my bag  and I gave him a chocolate... 
 Just one chocolate... 
 And that's when it happened. 
 [Chuckles] 
 He smiled. 
 For the first time. 
 A simple act of kindness had changed his life, and... 
 that beautiful smile was my missing puzzle piece. 
 [Chuckles] 
 The smile of an indigent half-wit? 
 That was your puzzle piece? 
 You understand they smile all the time, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 Your father is the Governor of Louisiana, yes? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Has he ever been to Angola? 
 The country or the prison? 
 Either. 
 Stand up. 
 Remove your shirt. 
 Hold the butter in your hand. 
 Not the tray... 
 The butter. 
 Take it in your hand.

 In the general ballpark, how long can you hold your breath?

 I love you. 
 Shut up, Hoover. 
 I was supposed to be in Ulan Bator tomorrow. 
 Now, because of your incompetence... 
 Who's first? 
 He is. 
 I am. 
 On the tarp. 
 FEATHERSTONE: You're absolutely right to be disappointed, sir. 
 We deserved to be put down. 
 [Trigger Clicking] 
 Let me say what an honor it's been to serve the organization. 
 Our sacred mission is... 
 - Damn it. 
 - Sir, may I? 
 The Glock has a tendency to jam. 
 Let me just... 
 I assume you'll try to kill Custer again. 
 - Immediately. 
 - [Clatters] 
 May I ask which method? 
 Gas leak, oven fire, junkie break-in... 
 If I may be so bold,  Custer just took out six Samson operatives... 
 Easily. 
 Have you had a chance to look at his file? 
 He poses a direct threat to the Holy Child. 
 We cannot underestimate him. 
 What would you suggest? 
 A target like this? 
 We should activate B.R.A.D. 
 You don't think that's overkill? 
 I think it's just the right amount of kill. 
 [Gun Cocks] 
 What is your name again? 
 Featherstone, sir. 
 We met at the conference in Paris last year  and the weapons lecture in Budapest  and this morning. 
 It will take time to activate B.R.A.D. 
 Meanwhile, I have a rape fantasy. 
 Oh, absolutely, sir. 
 I'll put on a miniskirt and some lipstick... 
 Not you. 
 I want a professional. 
 Oh. 
 Something rough, ready, cruel. 
 One of those no-means-yes things, sir? 
 - Exactly. 
 - We're on it. 
 I'll contact B.R.A.D. 
 Hoover here will take care of the professional. 
 [Gun Cocks] 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I'm going to leave the tarp out.

 But we fought 'em... 
 Teddy, Nunes, that albino with the teeth. 
 Remember? 
 We ran them off, and we got the hell out of there. 
 Must have been about an hour later, way up the road,  you suddenly realized the earache had gone.
