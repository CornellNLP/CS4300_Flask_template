 Visiting as Secretary of State,  Thomas Jefferson himself was said to have called Angelville. 
 "The place which burrows into your heart, and will not seem to leave."  Now, over here is the gift shop. 
 So, how do I know it worked? 
 Thank you. 
 All set? 
 How'd it go? 
 That looks like a very successful sober spell, indeed. 
 Come on, let's get a mop and some fresh air. 
 You were right to suggest her. 
 She's incredible. 
 Thank you, Councilman. 
 Glad I could help. 
 Please see yourself out. 
 You and your husband are next. 
 You're here for a libido spell? 
 Great. 
 Just need a minute, and then Madame L'Angelle will see you. 
 I want it back. 
 Help me. 
 Please. 
 I can't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Help me... 
 Weeble wobble, but he does fall down. 
 T.C., how the hell did he get out? 
 Sorry, Miss Christina. 
 This house doesn't run on "sorrys."  Now, put him back with the others, before someone sees. 
 And Miss Marie's office needs a clean-up. 
 Hello. 
 You must be lost. 
 Hi, we're looking for the plantation tour? 
 That starts outside. 
 Across the way. 
 Someone'll point you. 
 Thank you. 
 Although, this one's a little worried  that he's going to be sold off and taken away. 
 Don't you worry. 
 As long as you got your mama with you, you'll be fine. 
 Come on. 
 - Miss Marie asking after you. 
 - Headache, I'll be down in a sec. 
 You want some aspirin? 
 No, Jody. 
 I already took some. 
 - What's that in your lap? 
 - What? 
 - In your lap. 
 - Nothing. 
 - What is it? 
 - Get out of here! 
 I'll tell her you'll be down, then. 
 Thanks for your patience, folks. 
 You'll be on your way in a minute. 
 I'm not going back there! 
 Just going into the city to see a movie. 
 Wasn't leaving for good. 
 No law against movie-seeing last I checked. 
 Jody says you've been hiding something from me. 
 Well, here's a news flash, Jody's a damn liar. 
 Search her. 
 What was that? 
 Wouldn't you like to know, you crazy bitch. 
 Yes. 
 As a matter of fact,  I would. 
 Mama, you wouldn't. 
 You love me. 
 More than anything. 
 Hold her down. 
 Hold her! 
 No! 
 No! 
 Wait! 
 Stop! 
 Leave him alone! 
 I came back. 
 You have me! 
 I came back to you! 
 You have me! 
 Leave him alone! 
 No! 
 Please! 
 Leave him alone! 
 Don't you dare. 
 Don't you touch my Jesse. 
 Sew her up, now, Miss Marie? 
 No. 
 Strap her in the machine. 
 Gran'ma! 
 Gran'ma! 
 Hello! 
 Gran'ma! 
 Gran'ma! 
 Hello! 
 There's nobody here. 
 Hello! 
 Hello! 
 Gran'ma! 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 I don't know what happened. 
 You played God, and you let her die, rather than be like me. 
 You're a scumbag. 
 You killed her. 
 - That's what happened. 
 - No, I loved her. 
 Yeah, you and me both, Jesse. 
 Yeah, she really liked you, too, Cass. 
 You're right. 
 You're right, she did really like me. 
 Yeah, she liked me so much, she shagged me, how's that? 
 Yeah. 
 Back in Texas, we got high. 
 Next thing you know, we're in the back of her car,  and we're just shagging like a couple of animals back there. 
 Whoa, nelly, you're scuffing up my floor. 
 T.C.? 
 Lil' Jesse? 
 Lil' Jesse? 
 Lil' Jesse. 
 Miss Marie! 
 Miss Marie! 
 Look what the cat coughed up. 
 Gran'ma. 
 Is that your Gran'ma? 
 Holy shite, she's unattractive, isn't she... 
 I need your help. 
 She was dying. 
 Her name's Tulip, and she died. 
 I didn't know what else to do, so I thought of you. 
 - Where are you going? 
 - I'm hungry. 
 She doesn't have much time, right? 
 Before she can't come back at all. 
 You need to help me. 
 I'll pay you whatever. 
 How much? 
 How much you need? 
 Nine billion four hundred thousand ought to put us back on our feet. 
 - Right, Miss Marie? 
 - I can get you guns. 
 Me and Tulip, we used to work with  the Rodríguez Brothers down in Mexico. 
 I could introduce you. 
 We're always on the lookout for industrious Mexicans, Lil' Jesse. 
 But we already got guns. 
 Lil' Jesse, that's my swamp consommé. 
 You need to help me. 
 Right now. 
 A betrayer? 
 A boy who leaves his family to struggle and rot,  and get gobbled up by competitors, for him? 
 I don't need to help sh1t. 
 I'll do anything. 
 Just bring her back. 
 Please. 
 "Anything." That's a big word. 
 You know what I want. 
 Or maybe she's not worth it? 
 She is. 
 You gotta pull the slide back. 
 Is that them? 
 Hey, little girl, remember me? 
 Well, what you gawping at? 
 Come on over here, and give your mean ol' daddy a hug. 
 Now see, that's the ticket. 
 How come you're not in school? 
 - Fighting. 
 - Hey, now, no more of that. 
 The one thing I learned in prison, you got to watch your temper, okay? 
 - That your mom? 
 - She's working. 
 Well, she's not gonna have to work much longer  because I got a job interview down at Monday's Bistro. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Awful lot of felonies here, Mr O'Hare. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Entrusting yourself to an O'Hare is a dubious proposition,  has been for years. 
 Some call it the family curse. 
 A long line of losers, cheats and convicts. 
 But that's changing now. 
 With my little girl here as my witness,  I swear to you that as of today,  the O'Hares are done screwing things up. 
 Okay, yeah, come on down to Monday's, first thing Tuesday morning. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 You did it, Daddy! 
 You got the job! 
 Well, of course I did. 
 This calls for a celebration. 
 You still like them little rolls of candy? 
 Necco Wafers? 
 I'm gonna go down to the store,  and get you all the Necco Wafers you can eat. 
 - Thank you, Daddy. 
 - All right. 
 All right. 
 I'll be right back, okay? 
 - Promise? 
 - Cross my heart. 
 What are you smiling at? 
 You know what's coming. 
 I thought that was them. 
 No, it was Daddy! 
 He got a job! 
 He went to go get me candy, so we can celebrate! 
 Priscilla Jean, I got more chance of growing another tit  than that man going out and getting a job and coming back with candy. 
 It's true. 
 He crossed his heart. 
 When are you gonna grow up and learn something? 
 He's just another worthless O'Hare. 
 But I'm an O'Hare, too! 
 Yeah, you are. 
 Bitch! 
 Keep it down out there. 
 Daddy's back! 
 How was work? 
 - Why aren't you in school? 
 - Fighting. 
 Now, see, that's the one thing I learned in prison. 
 You can't let those sons of bitches push you around. 
 Give me a hand here. 
 "Head" dishwasher. 
 Like I'm supposed to be impressed by that. 
 - Talking to me like I'm an idiot. 
 - Maybe 'cause you are one. 
 And I told him, the plates are coming out spotty  because you're using too much dish soap, not too little. 
 But he didn't want to listen. 
 No, he wanted trouble. 
 Well, careful what you wish for, buddy. 
 Did you get my candy? 
 Why can't I do one right thing? 
 It's okay, Daddy. 
 Let's get those sons of bitches. 
 Good, she's still in Purgatory. 
 Got some fight in her. 
 So you can do this? 
 You can bring her back? 
 Well, Purgatory is a waiting room, but you can't wait forever. 
 Pretty soon, I'd say in like... 
 Soon, death will come to the door. 
 And when she answers, she'll be gone for good. 
 You know what I need? 
 - Yeah, I made a list. 
 - Well, hurry up, then. 
 - All right. 
 - And some transpoil? 
 I'm all out. 
 - Where am I gonna get some? 
 - Ask Jody. 
 Come on, I need your help. 
 That's better. 
 Now, it's just you and me. 
 Take this, go to the store. 
 What is it? 
 It's a list of Tulip's favourite things. 
 In order to invite her spirit back to the land of the living,  it helps to remind her of stuff she likes. 
 I see, it's a "favourite things" list to invite her spirit back  to the land of the living. 
 Well, that makes perfect sense. 
 I have no questions. 
 Good. 
 - Boo Berry, guns, beer. 
 DragonForce? 
 - It's a British heavy metal band. 
 Yeah, I know who DragonForce is, Jesus. 
 And, you know, sure, Tulip, she loves her kettle thrash. 
 But what about '70s folk? 
 What about like, JT, Joni Mitchell,  that's by far her favourite kind of music. 
 - Hey, Cass? 
 - What? 
 Anything else you wanna tell me about the girl I've known my entire life? 
 Yeah. 
 If it doesn't save her, I'm gonna kill you. 
 Right. 
 Just get what's on the list. 
 I'm gonna go and talk to Jody. 
 - Who's that? 
 - The guy that killed my father. 
 Hey. 
 It's been a while. 
 You're probably still pissed. 
 I need transpoil. 
 My girlfriend... 
 I don't have much time. 
 So, you gonna help me, or what? 
 You can dress up like your daddy all you want, kid. 
 But you never looked more like your mama than you do right now. 
 A lot to catch up on. 
 But for now,  your lady's in trouble, and you need some transpoil? 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I know just the place. 
 The Boyds, seriously? 
 You're right. 
 Bad idea. 
 Let's hear your better one. 
 Someone recognise you, that'll really piss 'em off. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm just gonna sorta piss 'em off. 
 Pull around back and wait. 
 The hell you want, Jody? 
 I come in peace. 
 I just wanna ask Madame for something to lend us. 
 Get lost. 
 She ain't gonna do you any favours. 
 What if I ask real, real nice? 
 Yeah! 
 That's right! 
 I know you? 
 Maybe. 
 You take communion? 
 Church of The Blessed Virgin? 
 No, man. 
 
 
 
 I don't know no blessed virgin. 
 Then I guess you don't know me. 
 Well, that's too bad, Preacher, 'cause I know this truck. 
 Just like old times, right, kid? 
 I got your transpoil, let's go. 
 - So young. 
 - Skin tighter than a hotel sheet. 
 Finish your chores. 
 There he is! 
 Sorry about the noggin. 
 I'll take a look at it if you like. 
 I'm good with wounds... 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 All right. 
 Come up out the way, you lightning-struck little bogtrotter. 
 Maybe later, when you're not so mad. 
 I got her favourite things. 
 - Is Jesse not back yet? 
 - Soon, or better be. 
 - What's that? 
 - Scorpion pepper. 
 Sometimes, if the spirit senses your pain,  - it'll come back to ease it. 
 - Right. 
 Maybe she'll come back for yours. 
 Years ago, I loved someone who loved another. 
 I tried to woo him. 
 Everything, anything,  to move his heart to mine, but nothing worked. 
 And I was beautiful, too, years ago... 
 Leave it. 
 The more it hurts, the more it helps. 
 Anyway, nothing worked. 
 I just wanted... 
 Just wanted to be wanted back. 
 So,  I made him a draft, a spell. 
 An old recipe from slavery days. 
 I made it, mixed it, and I sprayed him with it. 
 And it worked. 
 And from that moment on,  he wanted me and only me. 
 Day after day,  after day,  until I killed him. 
 I'm so grateful that you brought Jesse back to us, Irish. 
 If you ever wanted something in return,  all you have to do... 
 Is ask. 
 Come on, hurry up! 
 Jody! 
 I told you we had some catching up to do. 
 Give me the transpoil. 
 What do you think, kid? 
 Is today the day you finally beat me? 
 For your lady love's sake, I sure hope so. 
 Your mind's probably worrying on the girl inside there. 
 Better. 
 Glad to see you still got a little bit of that buck-wild left in you. 
 But you don't have enough to beat me. 
 Jody! 
 That's enough. 
 We just playing around, Miss Marie. 
 Good luck with your girl. 
 Attention! 
 This is the Department of Family and Protective Services! 
 They're here. 
 Secure the perimeter. 
 Incursion team to the rally point, and hold for my go. 
 Where they're taking us,  it's not gonna be any worse than this, okay? 
 You are now wards of the state. 
 Open the door, and step outside. 
 It's time. 
 Let's go. 
 Come on. 
 Magnesium. 
 Zinc. 
 Mercury. 
 Mercury, is that not poisonous, like? 
 She's already dead. 
 - Where... 
 - It's time to go to the orphanage. 
 Either you come out to us, or we're coming in to you. 
 One quick bowl before I go. 
 Transpoil? 
 Incursion team is a go to breach. 
 Repeat, the breach is a go. 
 This is your last warning. 
 Incursion team is a go to breach. 
 Repeat, breach is a go. 
 Why isn't it working? 
 Sometimes, it takes a moment to figure out how to come back,  and sometimes, there's not enough reason for them to come back at all. 
 Bullshit. 
 She'll come back. 
 She has to come back. 
 You wanna know what I need you for? 
 When you asked me the other day, it was so stupid, I couldn't think. 
 I need you for everything. 
 Everything, Tulip. 
 My entire life. 
 To drink, and have fun, and mess around with. 
 Who am I gonna rob a store with, except for you, you know? 
 I mean, I don't even know how to blow a safe for Christ sakes... 
 It's her favourite. 
 This is your last warning... 
 When you're walking and the streets are full of strangers. 
 All the news of home. 
 Give me a minute, okay? 
 I need to think. 
 Come on, Tulip, think. 
 - Think, Tulip! 
 - You need to go. 
 What? 
 What about you? 
 I'm a re-enactor. 
 I work here. 
 What? 
 I need you for everything. 
 - Jesse? 
 - Everything, Tulip. 
 My entire life. 
 Jesse, where are you? 
 Come on, Tulip. 
 Just cut the crap and come back. 
 - I can't... 
 - Please. 
 - Come back. 
 - No, no, no. 
 You need to go. 
 You need to go. 
 - No, no, no! 
 - Come back. 
 I need more time! 
 Just getting my things. 
 Maintained, supervised, and inspected by the State of Texas. 
 You're gonna love it. 
 Be right there. 
 You little... 
 Okay, now, we're pissed! 
 You need to go! 
 You need to go! 
 You need to go! 
 God? 
 Yes. 
 - You brought me back? 
 - No, that was another. 
 But now that you, Tulip O'Hare, are returning to life,  I'm counting on you for something very important. 
 Something to help me fulfil my great design. 
 You have been chosen. 
 No sh1t. 
 Listen to me carefully, Tulip O'Hare. 
 For I want you to  get those... 
 Oh, my God! 
 Thank God! 
 Thank God. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 You're welcome. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, we have a deal, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Or I could cheat and change my mind. 
 Kill you, like I should've done years ago. 
 Wouldn't take much. 
 Push you over, and you'd be dead before you hit the ground. 
 You think I haven't thought of that? 
 Push me, see what happens. 
 Gran'ma loves you. 
 More than anything. 
 Welcome home, Jesse.
