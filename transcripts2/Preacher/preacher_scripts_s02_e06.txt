 - We pay $5,000 per unit. 
 However, if you're willing to give more than 10%,  purchase price doubles. 
 Payment is made in full on the day of removal. 
 There's also a standard confidentiality clause. 
 That's detailed on page seven of the release. 
 Do you have any questions? 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes. 
 Will it... 
 hurt? 
 I told you. 
 Don't worry 'bout that. 
 I'm allowed to worry. 
 I'm your wife. 
 The procedure itself doesn't hurt. 
 Some donors complain of fatigue  accompanied by minor headaches. 
 Nothing that a few aspirin won't fix. 
 Yes, but... 
 will he be... 
 The long-term effects. 
 Yeah. 
 Common question. 
 The simple answer, as far as we can tell,  based on now thousands of clinical trials is:  there aren't any. 
 But would you like some more time to think it over? 
 We don't have time. 
 Mortgage company's breathin' down our backs, and your sister's not gonna bail us out this time. 
 Like, what about 10%? 
 Is that enough? 
 Absolutely. 
 But remember, 15 is double the price. 
 Trust me. 
 You won't even miss it.

 You wear a vest and that. 
 It's a game. 
 Where they pay you to get shot in the chest? 
 Yeah. 
 Or you pay them. 
 That part was unclear. 
 Well, we could get shot in the chest  for unclear reasons,  or we could do what we came to do in the first place  and look for God.

 This lounge singer I met. 
 Mm. 
 Lara the lounge singer. 
 That's right. 
 I remember now. 
 You were quite excited about her.

 No, I was excited about the lead she gave me.

 She was in trouble.

 That's it.

 Now, the God audition seems like a dead end. 
 All we have is a hand shooting a gun. 
 So good to find out who shot that bloody gun. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Why don't we just zoom in on the serial number? 
 - "Helping's" good. 
 - It is good. 
 - What? 
 - On the gun. 
 I said it was good. 
 Zoom in on the serial number  and then trace it back to the owner. 
 It's always good to give a girl a good helpin' whenever you can. 
 Just like they do in the shows and that. 
 I couldn't agree with you more. 
 What are you talkin' about? 
 Talking about zoomin' in on the gun  to find out who shot at you. 
 Just zoom in... 
 Okay, seriously. 
 What the hell happened with you and this girl? 
 I didn't marry her, Tulip. 
 I'll tell you that much. 
 [Banging] 
 Which one? 
 Tell me. 
 That one. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Don't make me shoot you, man! 
 I'll do it! 
 I swear! 
 I'll do it!

 There's no Preacher here, man! 
 I'm a Jew!

 You know, "zoom in," "resolve"... 
 "Hold on. 
 Is that a clue there?"  Like they do in the shows. 
 Hm. 
 [Footsteps] 
 Preacher? 
 [Man and woman screaming] 
 Don't make me bust you up, man! 
 When you say "the shows,"  you mean TV shows that take place say,  in outer space or the Pentagon? 
 Yeah, but we don't do any of that. 
 We... 
 We take the tapes down to the Circuit Works  and we let the Dork Docs do all the bloody faffin' about  with their technicalogical software and that. 
 Mm. 
 That so, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Used to work in TV shows, yeah? 
 - Which shows you watch exactly? 
 - I know 'em all. 
 Like, high-school shows, law shows, and all that. 
 Love serial killers and stuff like that. 
 Terrorist attacks and comedians. 
 I love reality TV... 
 You know, like, idjits  just ridin' 'round the world on motorcycles  and fat women competin' for prizes. 
 So basically, you watch trash TV. 
 I do not just basically watch trash TV at all. 
 It's really an in-depth survey  on the human experience, all right? 
 Watchin' those fat ladies transform  into beautiful things, wonderful things. 
 Then they finally learn to love themselves. 
 And sometimes the producers even pay  to get rid of their stretch marks. 
 You really oughta try watchin' it. 
 It's very amusing.

 Aw, dead-dead? 
 Wait, the angel from the casino? 
 I thought he was like... 
 - he couldn't die. 
 - I guess not. 
 Apparently, a cowboy shot him and he never came back. 
 So what do we do now? 
 What? 
 About the indestructible angel-killer? 
 I think it's pretty clear that we run. 
 We can't run forever.

 That's how he keeps trackin' us, right? 
 No. 
 I need that to help me find God. 
 Well, I don't know what then. 
 Why doesn't the Word work on him? 
 Works on everyone else. 
 Works on angels, people. 
 - Works on Cassidy. 
 - Does that. 
 The Saint made a deal with the angels. 
 Somethin' he could get, somethin' he wanted  in exchange for destroyin' Genesis. 
 - That's his weakness. 
 - Yeah, right. 
 Like, Superman has Kryptonite. 
 Spider-Man has his Mary Jane. 
 We've just gotta find out what the Saint's weakness is. 
 Great. 
 Let's do that then.

 We read.

 I used to drop acid and flick through these for hours, man. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Aha. 
 Really? 
 A book on tape? 
 Still a book. 
 Hello. 
 You're listening to another edition  of "American Psychopaths."  Chapter 57. 
 The Saint of Killers. 
 ♪  Our story begins in 1861. 
 Our backdrop... 
 The American Civil War. 
 Before he was a myth, our subject was a man. 
 Fighting for the Confederate Army. 
 Some called him heartless. 
 Others, insane. 
 His compatriots dubbed him "The Butcher of Gettysburg."  But all wars come to an end. 
 One day, as fate would have it,  he fell in love. 
 She hailed from Laredo,  a Christian girl of German descent. 
 It wasn't long till they were wed. 
 And sooner still, she gave him a daughter. 
 For a time, the cowboy was at peace. 
 ♪  But fortune favors the wind. 
 The cowboy lost his wife and daughter to disease. 
 Legend says that in that moment,  his soul shattered into a million pieces,  scattering to the four corners of the Earth. 
 Hate became the blood coursing through his veins,  the only living man without a soul. 
 On that fateful day,  the cowboy became the grim, taciturn,  implacable killing machine  known commonly as The Saint of Killers. 
 But our story doesn't end here. 
 The Saint sought bloody revenge  on the town of Ratwater... 
 ♪  Dying there in the famous tornado of 1881. 
 But soulless men have no place in paradise,  and God banished him to the Netherworld,  imprisoned and forced to relive his most injurious memory  over and over and over again. 
 It's there he rots. 
 The most hated man in Heaven,  the most dreaded in Hell,  rumored to be feared by Satan himself. 
 ♪  We hope you enjoyed this edition  of "American Psychopaths."  Join us next time for Chapter 58... 
 - Dick Cheney. 
 - All right. 
 Weaknesses? 
 I'm gonna start. 
 He's not very well-liked... 
 which is a weakness of a sort. 
 He is also a vicious,  child-murderin' maniac with no soul. 
 Although in this case, you know, that might be a strength. 
 - I don't know. 
 - He lost his family. 
 Now, I don't know if that's a weakness  so much as a... a thing that happened. 
 You know what? 
 Holy mother of bleedin' shite! 
 I forgot about Denis! 
 [Coughing] 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Allô? 
 Cassidy: Denis, don't go back to the apartment. 
 Cassidy?

 He's gonna shoot your bloody head off! 
 Don't open that door!

 Kill me and the deal is off.

 Fiore. 
 You don't know sh1t.

 Uh-huh. 
 [Gun cocks]

 Or see what doesn't happen.

 Let him go.

 That just kills me.

 Hold on. 
 That's an actor. 
 This whole thing's a cover-up.

 Where is He?

 But I know what you want. 
 Hear me! 
 You want to go to Heaven. 
 And tremble and know... 
 God won't get you there. 
 Of the world to come. 
 Not anymore. 
 Look for the changes... 
 You leave us alone, and I can. 
 The dying land... 
 Can you now? 
 The falling sky... 
 Why'd the angels send for you to kill me? 
 Genesis. 
 I got a power inside me. 
 A power that rivals God's. 
 I can command anyone in the universe to do my biddin'. 
 I can call upon the angels. 
 I can send a man to Hell if I want. 
 Look!! 
 I've done it before. 
 I can send you to Heaven. 
 I mean, it's just not as scary  if He's trying to be scary. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Do you know what it takes to get me to heaven? 
 What I need? 
 Yes. 
 And you can get that?

 Papa Bébé's been selling souls for over 150 years. 
 So you know exactly what I'm talkin' about. 
 Who the hell are you?
