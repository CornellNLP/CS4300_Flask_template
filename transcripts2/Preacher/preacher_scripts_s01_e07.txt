 announcer : Previously, on "Preacher"... 
 Jesse, it's important to make an example for others to learn from. 
 Jesse Custer : Come to church tomorrow. 
 You don't leave a Christian after that. 
 Odin Quincannon : My father's land. 
 It's yours. 
 Serve God. 
 I've fallen for you, Julie. 
 So what do we do now? 
 Go to hell, Eugene!

 Serve God. 
 Please join me in the prayer of confession. 
 "Most merciful God... 
 All : .. we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed by what we have done and by what we have left undone." 
 Wonderful sermon, Preacher. 
 Thank you so much, Mrs. Douglas. 
 We'll see you next time, okay? 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Nice to see you. 
 You take care, have a great weekend, what's left of it. 
 You get some rest. 
 Nice to see you, too. 
 Good to see you again. Thank you for coming back here. 
 Sheriff Root : Preacher. 
 See ya, Sheriff. 
 Has anybody seen Eugene? 
 Bye. 
 Have a good week, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thanks. I'll see you next time. 
 Hey, buddy. See you next time. Thank you. 
 [Church door closes] 
 [Demonic voices] 
 [Cattle lowing] 
 Explain yourself. 
 We didn't mean for it to get out of hand. 
 But you always said it's all right to stand up to bullies. 
 Sounds like this is more than just "standing up." 
 Three kids in the infirmary. 
 And Donnie Schenck lost a nipple. 
 What? 
 [Sighs] Tulip bit him, but that's 'cause he called her a piece of trash. 
 And it was an accident, right? 
 You thought you were just biting his shirt, and your mouth slipped. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We didn't mean for it to get out of hand. 
 All right, let's go. 
 Wait. What about Tulip? 
 Where's your mother? 
 Jail. 
 Where's your uncle? 
 Drunk. 
 We can't just leave her here. 
 Jesse : Thank you for the church. 
 Thank you for the dinner. 
 What else? 
 Uh, please help me on that test coming up next week. 
 And please take care of my mom, wherever she is. 
 [Sighs] Thanks for the lesson today. 
 I'm trying really, really hard not to be so bad. 
 [Sighs] 
 And thanks for helping my dad always do the right thing. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Dogs barking] 
 Boy : [Laughs] 
 Aah! 
 Gimme the pants. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Car engine idling] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Snoring] 
 Come on. 
 [Straining] 
 Come on. 
 Come on, Walter. Come on. 
 Work with me. 
 Let's get you inside. 
 You gotta help me. Come on. 
 [Groans] 
 [Snoring] 
 [Sighs, clears throat] 
 Okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 Jesse : Wagners... premarital counseling. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Jackson... blessing. 
 [Muttering] 
 Phil and Melinda baptism arrangements. 
 That's a busy day. 
 Emily : Mm-hmm. 
 Hard to believe. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, like you always say, we're just getting started. 
 [Music plays in background] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Oh, busy. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Corleone Family wedding day busy. 
 [Laughs] 
 So, how's it going? Huh? 
 It's good. 
 How are you? 
 Good, yeah. Very good. 
 How are  you  doing? 
 I'm still good, Cass. 
 What's up? 
 Well, see, to me, I think what's up with you seems like the more interesting question here, don't you think? 
 What's up with me is I'm stuck in a weird conversation with you. 
 Unfortunately, I got Bible study coming up, so unless you figure out what it is you want to talk... 
 Hey, I saw, I saw, I saw. All right? 
 What do you mean? 
 With the arse... with the arsey-faced kid. 
 Jesse, I saw, all right? You know? 
 Oh. 
 [Dishes clanking] 
 Yeah, look, we're best mates, you know? 
 I... I... We'll figure something out. 
 I just... 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm not judging you, mate. 
 I just need to know what I can do to help out here. 
 Help what? 
 With the kid, Jesse. 
 I saw what you done to him. 
 Ca... 
 You ready for me? 
 Ready. 
 All right. 
 Oh. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What you got there? 
 I'm cooking dinner. 
 Oh, dinner, eh? 
 Yeah. So what? 
 So whatever happened to getting out of here? 
 Going ripping the balls off what's-his-name? 
 Bloody... Pedro? 
 Carlos. 
 Right. 
 We're still doing that. 
 It's just on pause. 
 I see. 
 Hamburgers, pre-pattied, hash browns. 
 Carrot sticks and a "frozen vegetable medley." 
 [Laughing] Why not? 
 Come on. 
 I, uh, I-I didn't tell him, by the way. 
 Tell who what? 
 Jesse. 
 You know, about... 
 Well, that's good. 
 'Cause he'd probably kill you. 
 He won't kill me. I'm his best friend. 
 And I'm his girlfriend. Doesn't mean I tell him everything. 
 All right, well, if you're his girlfriend, then why did you... 
 Why did I what? 
 Why did you... make love to me the other night? 
 [Scoffs] Make love? 
 [Laughing] Oh. 
 I didn't. 
 Me and Jesse talk a lot, is all, you know. 
 And I just... I didn't say anything. 
 [Chuckles] So you're bloody welcome. 
 You two talk a lot, huh? 
 All the time. 
 You tell him everything. 
 Pretty much. 
 You tell him what you are? 
 Absolu... Yes, absolutely. 
 Oh, really? Mm-hmm. 
 I did. I told him like... 
 I've told him like nine times, all right? 
 Why'd you do that? Why did I do what?! 
 Why did you tell him nine times? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Because I thought it was worth repeating. Huh? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You didn't tell him nine times. 
 You didn't tell him  once. 
 Not really. 
 And you know why. 
 'Cause he wouldn't be okay with it. 
 Oh, come on. That's not true. 
 Okay. 
 Well, it's not. 
 He's a bloody preacher, for Christ's sake. 
 He's a preacher, all right? 
 You know, his job is to... is to, uh... 
 [Taps table] 
 T-To tell you the truth, I don't... 
 I don't know exactly what his job is, but I know it's not walking around, just casting judgement. 
 I bet I could tell him right now, and he wouldn't give a kitten's arse hole. 
 All right? 
 Who's his favorite movie star? 
 What?! 
 His favorite movie star! 
 Who does he think pretty much sh1ts sunshine? 
 Who would that be? 
 It's Ryan Phillippe. It's Ryan Phillippe. 
 John Wayne. 
 [Sighs] Wake up, Cassidy. 
 Jesse's a preacher boy from West Texas. 
 So what?! 
 So tell him. 
 If you really want to. See what he does. 
 I bet I know a thing or two about him you don't. 
 Like what? 
 Like did you know he could make you do things just by telling you to? 
 [Scoffs] Not me. 
 [Jesse speaking indistinctly in distance] 
 You'd be surprised. 
 [Grunting] 
 I'm gonna lick your eyeball! 
 Nnh! 
 Hey! 
 Homework? 
 Done. 
 All of it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I finished my geometry on the bus. 
 Tulip? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Good. 
 Dishes do themselves now, do they? 
 No, sir. 
 No, sir. 
 [Water running, radio playing] 
 Out of dish soap. Check the closet. 
 John : She's stubborn, strong-willed... 
 [Continues indistinctly] 
 Mm-hmm. Mostly welfare. 
 It's a lot for anyone to take on. 
 [Continues indistinctly] 
 You asleep? 
 What? 
 Pee the couch again? 
 No. 
 Till the end of the world. 
 Right? 
 Mm. 
 [Grunts] 
 You have to say your part of it, or else it doesn't count. 
 Till the end of the world. 
 [Slow music plays] 
 Have a seat. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 You can't do this! Hey, are you listening to me?! 
 I said no! 
 I said you can't! 
 John : Jesse! 
 Dad, stop them! We got to stop them! 
 Dad! 
 Wait! Open the door! 
 Open the goddamn door! 
 [Car engine starts] 
 No! 
 I know you don't understand... 
 She was good. 
 She didn't get in trouble barely at all the whole time! 
 Why did you do that?! 
 I know it's hard. 
 Why?! 
 Look... 
 Tell me! 
 Because she's an O'Hare, all right? 
 There's always gonna be trouble. 
 Dear God, please take care of Tulip, wherever she is. 
 [Sighs] And please, please... kill my dad. 
 Kill him and send him straight to Hell. 
 [Conga drums playing] 
 Run! Run! 
 Don't look back! 
 Don't look back! 
 Lot's wife, that's your cue to look back. 
 Oh. Great. 
 [All gasp] 
 Good. Good. 
 Uh, Angie will duck behind the pulpit. 
 Davie throws the salt. 
 But that... that's enough. Thank you. 
 Uh, Angie? 
 And Ben. 
 [Drumming stops] 
 God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city and set it on fire with its inhabitants and laid waste the country with the like burning. 
 Anyway... just getting the kinks out. 
 What do you think? 
 I think they should be more scared. 
 An inferno at your back consuming every man, woman, and child in its path. 
 And you're what? 
 Smiling? 
 They should be terrified. 
 The world's ending. 
 Otherwise, who gives a sh1t? 
 Uh, okay. 
 Well, keep going. 
 O-kay. 
 So, let's reset from... 
 Abraham trying to cut a deal with God to be merciful. 
 Business looks good. 
 Mr. Quincannon. 
 Might I have a word? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Right. 
 
 
 
 [Door closes] 
 So, I did it. 
 I finished the model. 
 Really? Yeah. 
 Topped off the south wall, placed the last of Santa Anna's men. 
 Well, I'm impressed. 
 Explains why we didn't see you in church this morning. 
 Yeah, well, I've, uh... 
 I've been busy. 
 Something you want to talk about? 
 Have you ever been to Brazil? 
 Brazil... no. 
 There's a slaughterhouse there in a place called uh, Mato Grosso. 
 Processed 5 million head of cattle last year alone. 
 That's 5 million head. 
 They say you can hear the sounds of 'em all the way down to the Cuiaba River. 
 Yep. 
 I, uh... 
 I've done a terrible thing, Preacher. 
 Go on. 
 When I inherited Quincannon Meat and Power from my father, we were the largest packing plant in Texas. 
 Now we don't do in a year what we used to do in a month. 
 Hell, what my grandaddy did in a week. 
 I neglected my birthright. 
 Let my family down. 
 Well... with God, it's... 
 It's never too late to make things right. 
 I couldn't agree more. 
 [Sniffs, clears throat] 
 What's this? 
 That's a deed of transfer for your church and land, as agreed upon. 
 It's all aboveboard. 
 Had Miles take a look at it last night. 
 I'm sorry... you need a pen? 
 Odin, I didn't agree to this. 
 Yes, you did... in my office. 
 What, the bet? 
 If I agreed to come to church... 
 And I did. I came to church. 
 And you left a Christian, which is what we agreed. 
 Jesse, you should know better than anyone that I'm no Christian. 
 You're lying. 
 No, I'm not. 
 You agreed to serve God. 
 Everyone saw it. Saw it with my own eyes. 
 Well, I'm sorry, Preacher. 
 You saw wrong. 
 Sign. 
 I'm not signing anything. 
 We made an agreement. 
 I don't care what we made. 
 I'm not giving you my father's church. 
 Yeah. 
 [Paper rips] 
 You know, toward the end there, William Travis wrote a letter, one of them cold nights of his up behind the garrison walls. 
 When I was a boy, I kept a copy folded under my pillow. 
 [Clears throat] 
 "I have answered the demand with a cannon shot. 
 I shall never surrender or retreat." 
 "Victory or death." 
 Exactly right. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll be back. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Bird cawing] 
 He said I could smoke out here, as long as it's tobacco. 
 He... 
 He said so. 
 I know... there's things I don't know about him, things that would... surprise me. 
 Yeah. 
 But, then again, that's true of all of us. 
 Don't you think? 
 [Sighs] Yeah. 
 Jesse's a good bloke. 
 Dinner's on. 
 You know, everyone says it's not supposed to make sense, like that's the whole point, dude. 
 And I'm just saying, you know, that's like an excuse for lazy storytelling. 
 J-J-J-Just don't sell me shite and tell me it's gold, all right? 
 I might be stoned, but I'm not high. 
 You know what I mean? 
 [Muffled] Plot matters. 
 Hmm. Never seen a Coen Brothers. 
 Yeah, well, don't start with "Lebowski," or you're done. 
 [Sighs] 
 How are the hash browns? 
 Oh, delicious. Tastes really good. Lovely. 
 They've got a, uh... sort of a flavor to them? 
 Right. Vanilla extract. 
 Huh. 
 But not too much, 'cause otherwise, it's, uh, I don't know. 
 Overpowering? No, absolutely. 
 [Cassidy hums] 
 You know, don't get me wrong... 
 "Miller's Crossing," "No Country For Old Men"... structured, quality filmmaking. 
 Bloody "Ladykillers." They can do it. 
 You just gotta give a sh1t. 
 Know what I mean? 
 What's your problem? 
 What? 
 [As Jesse] What? 
 [Normal voice] Haven't said four words. 
 What happened? Did someone's cat die? 
 Leave it alone, Tulip. 
 What the heck is going on?! 
 Sheriff : [Clears throat] 
 Sorry. I was knockin'. 
 Oh. 
 Miss Woodrow. 
 Evening, Sheriff. 
 I hate to interrupt your supper, but I was hoping... 
 Well, I'm... I'm looking for Eugene. 
 A-And I was hoping he'd run off to spend time with you, like he sometimes does. 
 But I reckon not. 
 It's the darndest thing. 
 Have you seen him? Have you seen Eugene? 
 [Alarm beeping] 
 Cassidy : Oh! No! 
 Oh! Oh, there we go. 
 It's out again. 
 Oh, dear God. Look at that. 
 All right? They all right? 
 [Metal clanks] 
 Careful. 
 Oi. Down there. 
 [Sighs] 
 Whew! 
 What the bloody hell happened there? 
 I think... 
 Did you put vanilla extract on the bake sheet? 
 [Beeping continues] 
 No. 
 Huh. 
 Is that flammable? 
 Very. 
 That's... That's very shocking, actually. 
 I didn't know that. Did you know that? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. God. I had no idea. 
 All right. 
 Well, um... 
 I will get out of your hair. 
 When I saw him this morning before church, he said he was gonna come by to find you. 
 Jesse : Before church... 
 Nope. No, I-I didn't see him. 
 It's the darndest thing. 
 Actually, you did see him. 
 I did? 
 You were in the church, and I came in and I said Eugene wanted to talk to you? 
 You said you were too busy but to send him in anyway. 
 [Dramatic music plays] 
 But I... saw him leave after. 
 So... 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Sheriff : Oh. 
 All right, then. 
 Sorry to have bothered you. 
 I'll walk you out. 
 Cassidy : Hey, Padre? 
 [Groans] 
 So, how's it going? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Well... 
 [Sniffs] I got a bloody nose. 
 That's not what I meant. 
 [Sighs] 
 I didn't mean to. 
 I said the words, and he was gone. 
 You know, I went to Atlantic City once with the wife of a Russian gangster, right? 
 And honestly, she was lovely. 
 But Atlantic City turns out to be not much more than a shank of shite, so, you know. 
 We all make mistakes, don't we? 
 All right, come on. 
 What's next? How can I help you? 
 Well... maybe take a look at the balcony railing. 
 See how busy we've got. Be even busier come Sunday. 
 I meant, what are you gonna do about Eugene? 
 Well, what can I do? 
 [Sniffs] You tell me. 
 You just sent an innocent kid to be forever poked by piping-hot pitchforks. 
 I think acting like you give a damn might be a good start, mate. 
 He's not that innocent. 
 What? 
 You know about Eugene and Tracy Loach? 
 Tracy Loach was prom queen, rodeo queen... queen of everything. 
 Everyone loved her. 
 Eugene loved her, too. 
 One day, he gets the courage to confess his love, and she rejects him. 
 Now, any normal kid would sulk, nurse his broken heart, let it go. 
 Not Eugene. 
 Eugene got a shotgun, put it to her head, and blew half her head off. 
 Once that was done, he turned the gun on himself. 
 So... Eugene is not that innocent. 
 So he deserves it. 
 Is that what you're saying? 
 I'm saying better men then Eugene Root have been cast down. 
 Much better men. 
 No, Jesse, this Genesis thing, it's really playing with your head. 
 And those English boys... they're right. 
 We've got to give this thing back... 
 I'm not giving it back. 
 Not part of the plan. 
 Oh, for... There is no plan! 
 There's no plan! 
 You've lost control of this thing! All right? 
 For Christ's sake, you've sent an innocent kid to Hell! 
 How can you say there's no plan, Cassidy? 
 [Groans] 
 Angels. 
 [Sighs] 
 Angels, Heaven, and Hell... you've seen it. 
 You've seen it's real. It's real, and it has a reason. 
 Look, I'm not saying... And it's God's plan. 
 If his reason, if his judgment is to send one more sinner, one more lost soul into the fire, what can I do? 
 Except stand aside... and watch him burn. 
 Tulip was right about you, you know. 
 Tulip. 
 What do you know about Tulip? 
 Never mind. 
 What about me? 
 I'm no innocent, either. 
 I'm a lazy, lying, self-obsessed, drug-abusing, cheating fornicator with a filthy mouth and no ambition. 
 And I think your God, if he really does exist, is not more than a stocious moppet who smells his own farts! 
 And that's not the worst of my sins, neither... 
 Preacher. 
 Not by a long shot. 
 What's this for? 
 It's for me, Padre. 
 [Exhales] 
 Or will you let me burn, too? 
 [Groaning] 
 [Screaming] 
 Everything all right? 
 Where'd Cassidy go? 
 Jesse? Where's Cassidy? 
 [Sternly] Jesse? 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 You know about him? 
 What he is? 
 Jesus. That's right. 
 You did. 
 You know? 
 I-I... I don't know anything. 
 Jesse Custer, what did you do to him? 
 You son of a bitch. 
 Throw someone out on their ass, just 'cause they don't live up to your uptight, redneck Christian standards. 
 Your daddy would by proud. 
 Don't you talk about him! 
 What do you know about standards... 
 O'Hare? 
 Frozen vegetables? 
 Vanilla hash browns? 
 Gimme a break. 
 What are you even doing here? 
 That's a real good question. 
 Dick. 
 Jesse? 
 Jesse, whatever... is going on... whatever it is, or... whatever he did, or whatever it is that's going on... 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 From... the day you came back here... first moment I saw you... 
 I... just... believed in you. 
 I believed in you. 
 Well, that was stupid. 
 Go home, Emily. 
 John : Wake up. Jesse, wake up. 
 Jesse? 
 Under the bed... right now. 
 Stay quiet. 
 [Banging] 
 Get out of here. Told you to stay away. 
 [Bat thudding, groaning] 
 Ooh! [Groans] 
 Jesse, much bigger things are coming for you, much bigger things than this here. 
 So you got to be one of the good guys. 
 'Cause why? 
 'Cause there's way too many of the bad. 
 You promise me? 
 [Voice breaking] I promise, Daddy. 
 You stop that. 
 We Custers don't cry. 
 We fight. 
 I did this, Daddy! 
 I prayed for this! It's all my fault! 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Thud] 
 [Banging] 
 [Grunting] 
 Come back. 
 Come back! 
 Come back! 
 Come back! 
 Come back!! 
 [Dramatic music plays]
