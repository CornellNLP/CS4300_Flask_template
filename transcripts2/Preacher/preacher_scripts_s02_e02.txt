 Stop! 
 I said, "stop!"  -This way! 
 -He's down there. 
 Right over there! 
 stop him! 
 -whoa! 
 -Yeah! 
 Whoo! 
 Hell, yeah! 
 Smoked him! 
 Man: What can't guns do? 
 Yeah! 
 Another problem solved by guns. 
 Oh, man! 
 All right! 
 Look! 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 Run! 
 No! 
 Run! 
 Aah! 
 ohh! 
 Ugh! 
 Jess, we gotta go. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 He's killing them all. 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 He'll kill us, too, if we don't go now. 
 Where's tulip? 
 you hear that?! 
 We gotta go! 
 Look. 
 Newscaster: The death toll continues to climb  in the small west Texas town where a large methane leak caused a devastating explosion. 
 Grim, new details are emerging as local authorities  are reporting that survivors are highly unlikely. 
 Authorities are compiling a list... 
 All right, we gotta go. 
 We gotta go. 
 We gotta go. 
 Wha-wha-what? 
 What is it? 
 Look. 
 Let's go! 
 let's go. 
 Get down. 
 Man: No! 
 Don't sho--  Jesse, now would be a really good time for Genesis. 
 I tried. 
 It doesn't work. 
 The window's painted shut. 
 Climb up on me shoulders and see if you can pry it open. 
 please don't! 
 Hey, wait a minute. 
 I pressed root beer. 
 Shh! 
 Have any quarters? 
 Shut up. 
 Mass murderer. 
 I pressed root beer, not ginger ale. 
 It's not fair! 
 What's wrong with ginger ale? 
 It's good for blood loss, you know that? 
 I want root beer! 
 Hey! 
 Shh! 
 Shh! 
 Be quiet. 
 I want root beer. 
 do you have any quarters? 
 Cassidy: All right. 
 Three possible explanations here for all of this. 
 Number one -- Terminator. 
 Machine sent from the future to kill one of us. 
 Number two -- Terminator 2. 
 Machine sent from the future to kill all three of us. 
 Or number three -- he's nazg? l, fell rider. 
 "Lord of the rings" -- brilliant film. 
 Come on, cass. 
 Well, what do you think? 
 Who the hell is he? 
 How does he keep finding us like that? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, what about Mike? 
 Still not answering the phone. 
 I'm sorry about your town, padre. 
 Do you think that guy back there had something to do with it? 
 I don't know, cass. 
 That's another thing god's gonna need to explain,  but we're never gonna find him  with that damn cowboy on our asses  and I don't know how to stop him. 
 Announcer: "The amazing Ganesh."  A performance to remember  from a performer you will never forget. 
 Hey. 
 I almost forgot to ya. 
 I was watching TV last night. 
 You will never guess who come on this commercial. 
 Someone who actually might be able to help us here. 
 Someone who actually might know what to do with this bloody cowboy. 
 If you say "Gandalf", I'm going to hit you. 
 No, I mean really be able to help us out here. 
 ha, ha, ha. 
 ha, ha, ha. 
 Whoo! 
 Aw, someone's been bloody busy, haven't they? 
 He's doing really well. 
 Fiore and his partner are the angels that came to annville. 
 They're the ones that first told me about Genesis. 
 No, I -- no, I thought --  I thought this one was deblanc. 
 No, that's Fiore. 
 Oh, maybe you're right. 
 I have no idea. 
 Where you going? 
 Drink. 
 You guys got this. 
 She all right? 
 Let's go. 
 Listen, these angels --  how did we leave things with them? 
 Uh... 
 You know. 
 Good. 
 you're still mad. 
 I tried to give it back. 
 I really did, remember? 
 Genesis wouldn't leave. 
 It wanted to stay with me, so... 
 Excuse me. 
 Um, I'm sorry. 
 Um... 
 Oh, come on. 
 Again? 
 Go on. 
 Okay. 
 Get it over with. 
 Yes. 
 Sorry. 
 - Jesus. 
 - Endless. 
 Anyway, you and... 
 Y-your friend -- where is he by the way? 
 Dead. 
 No, I th-- I thought angels couldn't die. 
 He's dead. 
 All right. 
 Anyway, you guys were right. 
 You said word would get out about Genesis  and the bad men would want it for themselves. 
 Well, that's a happened. 
 Someone's after us. 
 A cowboy. 
 We don't know how to get rid of him. 
 We thought maybe you could help us, deblanc. 
 Tell us what you know. 
 The cowboy isn't a man... 
 At all. 
 Not anymore. 
 His name's the Saint of killers. 
 I thought that was a ghost story. 
 He's real. 
 He's a beast straight out of hell. 
 But he doesn't want Genesis for himself. 
 He wants to kill it... 
 And you. 
 And there's nothing anyone can do to stop him. 
 Except me...'Cause I'm the one that hired him. 
 there. 
 That's what I know. 
 Frank: Hey. 
 Hey! 
 There he is! 
 Hi, Ganesh. 
 This is for you. 
 Take a pic. 
 How do you do it, Ganesh? 
 How do you die, then come back to life? 
 Ha ha! 
 Give away my secret? 
 Nice try, kid. 
 Nice try. 
 Okay. 
 Man: Two minutes till showtime. 
 Anyway. 
 You hired this Saint? 
 Genesis is too dangerous. 
 Once we saw it wouldn't go back with us,  we told him it had to be destroyed. 
 In exchange for what? 
 What are you offering in return? 
 I could make you un-hire him. 
 go on, then. 
 Make me. 
 Use it. 
 Watch what happens. 
 That's how he's finding us, isn't it? 
 He's tracking the word? 
 That's right. 
 We called heaven, you know? 
 Right. 
 On our phone, which you stole. 
 It's a good thing I did, 'cause you know what we found out? 
 God's gone missing. 
 He's gone. 
 Gone? 
 Gone where? 
 You don't know? 
 No. 
 Right. 
 Well, no one seems to. 
 I understand why you did what you did. 
 But things have changed. 
 We're on the same side now. 
 If this Saint isn't stopped,  if Genesis is destroyed,  chances are we're never gonna find god. 
 I understand. 
 This is serious. 
 I don't know what happened to me. 
 I used to be happy. 
 Until I came to this place, this earth,  all I knew was peace. 
 But now? 
 and this is my only hesitation at helping you, preacher,  my only hesitation whatsoever --  and this is I really don't... 
 Give a sh1t. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 Frank, hat. 
 Frank: Ah, yes, sir. 
 Coming, sir. 
 get off. 
 Oh, uh, by the way, I'm Fiore. 
 Deblanc was the other one. 
 What now? 
 Frank: Ladies and gentlemen... 
 I'm gonna walk out there and kick the sh1t out of him. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 No, no, no. 
 All right. 
 ...the amazing Ganesh! 
 Calm down. 
 I mean after that. 
 Use the word, bring the Saint here,  then make the angel call him off. 
 If he can? 
 If he can even get close enough to him? 
 After the Saint shoots up half the bloody casino? 
 It's very good. 
 Surgical. 
 I like it. 
 What do you suggest? 
 Well, me and Fiore have a bit of history. 
 So... 
 Let me have a crack at him. 
 I dunno, cass. 
 No, look. 
 I know -- I know screwed up, all right? 
 But you gotta let me make it up. 
 I have a skill set, too, all right? 
 I can help. 
 And if my way doesn't work,  then we go with your bloodbath version. 
 How's that? 
 How long is this "crack" gonna take? 
 2 hours 45 minutes. 
 Torrent downloaded from RARBG  What are you gonna do? 
 Cassidy: Like I said, i have a skill set. 
 You okay? 
 I know Walter wasn't much, but... 
 He was my only family left. 
 I know. 
 Remember when he came to my bring daddy to first grade day? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Showed up so drunk,  he kept fallin' off the little kids' desk. 
 Then he threw up by the swing sets. 
 But I wasn't that mad, you know? 
 He was always throwing up and falling off of things. 
 I wasn't that mad 'cause... 
 He wore a suit and tie. 
 I don't know where it came from. 
 Lord knows i never saw it again after,  but, um... 
 That day... 
 He wore a suit and tie... 
 For me. 
 So, your angel gonna help us? 
 Cassidy's working on it. 
 We'll see. 
 I trust him. 
 Got a few hours. 
 You want to hit the tables? 
 Our whole entire town just blew up, Jesse. 
 Okay. 
 What then? 
 let's get a room. 
 what next? 
 Bathtub seems like a good size. 
 Why don't we give that a shot? 
 I meant about god. 
 We still doing that? 
 Assuming Cassidy can get this Saint character off our backs. 
 We keep going. 
 We keep looking for him. 
 That's the plan, right? 
 That's what we agreed. 
 I know. 
 I mean, you don't have a church anymore, Jesse. 
 And annville's gone. 
 I mean, what does it matter? 
 It matters more. 
 Our hometown blows up in a mushroom cloud of cow sh1t? 
 Things he has to answer for are piling up by the minute. 
 Okay. 
 Where do we look? 
 I don't know. 
 I just don't know. 
 Don't fret. 
 You'll figure it out. 
 You're good at that. 
 You're one of the best figure-it-out-er's I know,  Jesse custer. 
 Thanks, babe. 
 Now what -- bathtub or closet? 
 let's get married. 
 Excuse me? 
 I was thinking about what you said  about Walter being your last and only family. 
 Well, annville's gone, but...We're still here. 
 I spotted a wedding chapel in the lobby. 
 Let's get married. 
 Cassidy: There you are. 
 let's talk. 
 aah! 
 You hate marriage. 
 When did I say that?! 
 You always said it was stupid and pointless. 
 I'm pretty sure that was you. 
 I just thought after everything that's gone wrong,  it might be nice for us to have something go right. 
 Maybe it is stupid. 
 It's not as if we come from families with great marriages. 
 Was just a thought. 
 Jesse custer, that was the worst  marriage proposal i ever heard. 
 your basic ingredients here --  heroin, rock cocaine, lemon juice, mineral water. 
 Tap water these days? 
 Who knows what's in it? 
 You know what I mean? 
 I know what you're doing. 
 What? 
 Have you done this before? 
 No. 
 You want me to change my mind about helping you,  and I'm not going to. 
 Well, but hang on a minute. 
 I'm not here to change anybody's mind about anything. 
 All right? 
 Now, look, we're mates. 
 And I noticed you were looking down. 
 I thought to myself, i thought,  "my man Fiore looks down. 
 I should go and cheer him up. 
 That's what I should."  And there's nothing like a bit of speedball  to turn your whole day around. 
 Come on. 
 I have a 6:00 curtain. 
 And you'll be there with bells on it, all right? 
 No, no, no, no, no, my friend. 
 First time means mainline, all right? 
 Just keep your head still like that. 
 That's it. 
 All right, hold still. 
 Here it is, mate. 
 Nice, huh? 
 Okay, less heroin. 
 deblanc and I had a legendary friendship. 
 Legendary. 
 He'd scream at me sometimes, sure. 
 But I'd scream right back at him. 
 It was just that kind of thing, you know? 
 He'd do something, and then I'd do something in response and so on. 
 A friendship like that? 
 I don't how to describe it. 
 Was it legendary? 
 Yes. 
 Exactly. 
 Legendary. 
 How was the s*x? 
 What you mean? 
 You shared a room, right? 
 Shared everything. 
 And you slept together? 
 Of course. 
 We were best friends. 
 More speedball? 
 He can kill anyone. 
 He killed deblanc. 
 All right, but -- but -- but if angels,  if they live in heaven, where do dead angels go? 
 That's the question, isn't it? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yes, it is. 
 good god. 
 That Betty's a sly one, isn't she? 
 With Veronica swishing about all the time, she has to be. 
 I mean, that's a lot of foreskins. 
 Mm. 
 what you think they're doing with 'em? 
 I don't know. 
 Making money,  putting them into whatever they feel like. 
 like what? 
 I don't know. 
 Like... 
 Bed linens  and lawn furniture, food. 
 Could be a shite-load of foreskin  in this here ice cream for all we know. 
 well, it would explain the creamy. 
 ah, "the creamy."  Gross. 
 Thanks. 
 Gonna be a wait. 
 Love is in the air. 
 Day cap at the bar? 
 No fun in doing this sober. 
 thanks. 
 This is crazy. 
 I know, right? 
 We're getting married. 
 Yeah, we all are. 
 Good crazy, though, right? 
 Awesome crazy. 
 I'm gonna go change my shirt. 
 What's wrong with your shirt? 
 Needs changing. 
 It'll be fine. 
 It's all gonna be fine. 
 Hey, tulip. 
 Hey, Gary. 
 Nice shirt. 
 I remember the first time i heard his voice. 
 "Summer wind"  coming over the radio at the bangalore bistro. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's like velvet honey. 
 Yup, Sinatra was --  like honey! 
 now what? 
 
 
 
 This sh1t? 
 Cannons and saws and blowing your brains out? 
 savages. 
 Animals. 
 People like violence. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 No, I get it. 
 I get it. 
 I like a good stabbing myself now and again. 
 But don't forget the music. 
 Whatever it is, no matter the question,  music's your answer. 
 Maim and kill till you're blue in the face for all I care. 
 But in the end... 
 You gotta remember the music. 
 He came for the jazz. 
 Man: Holy sh1t! 
 It's Ganesh! 
 You all right? 
 Cheers. 
 Hey, hey. 
 I figured out where to go. 
 Where to look next. 
 Great. 
 Did you talk to him? 
 Yeah, it's taken care of. 
 Seriously? 
 He's gonna call off the Saint? 
 Yeah. 
 I think he needed someone to talk to. 
 Hmm. 
 Great. 
 Tulip and I will get married, then we'll hit the road. 
 You... 
 You're -- you're getting married? 
 Kind of spur of the moment kind of thing. 
 Crazy, huh? 
 Uh, no. 
 No. 
 Not at all. 
 It was meant to be, actually. 
 Mm. 
 so, where is she now? 
 I thought that was you at the bar. 
 You were right. 
 How are you, Gary? 
 I'm extremely well. 
 Everything's good. 
 Good. 
 You wanna come in? 
 You're not busy? 
 Not at all. 
 Come on in. 
 Long way from Louisiana. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 The boss sends me on the road time to time to look in on things. 
 Check the machines, check the skim. 
 You know...Annoy the sh1t outta people. 
 That's right. 
 Viktor's got slots in Texas now. 
 I forgot. 
 What about you? 
 What -- what -- what you've been up to? 
 Good. 
 Mm. 
 Hey, what's up with that priest? 
 From the bar? 
 Oh, he's just someone I'm working with. 
 Hmm. 
 Looks like hard work. 
 Gary -- Viktor's been looking for you. 
 I know. 
 You should get in touch with him. 
 He's been looking a long, long time now. 
 I'm an asshole. 
 I've been meaning to, and I will. 
 How about now? 
 Now now? 
 Well, I can't now. 
 I -- I have... 
 ...a thing. 
 What is a thing? 
 I have a thing! 
 Tulip, what's a thing?! 
 I just -- i have a thing. 
 give me a break on this one, gar. 
 Okay? 
 Say you didn't see me. 
 Tulip, if it was me...Maybe. 
 Old times' sake. 
 But Viktor's a different situation  he wouldn't understand. 
 Make the call. 
 No. 
 Then I will. 
 Don't do that again. 
 No reception. 
 Damn. 
 come on. 
 Damn it. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Gimme me some bars. 
 Where's that signal? 
 Knew I should have switched providers. 
 Come on. 
 I can't do this now, Gary. 
 Please. 
 Not today. 
 Bitch, I'm gonna kill you. 
 oh, man. 
 My shirt. 
 Cassidy: Jaysis. 
 What happened? 
 Don't tell Jesse. 
 hindu priest: May you remember the lord. 
 May this pious feeling pervade all your activities. 
 May you be righteous in your deeds. 
 Amen. 
 Women. 
 Level up. 
 The Saint? 
 You can call him off? 
 We hired him. 
 His contract was with us. 
 He'll do what I say. 
 Then I can use the word again? 
 For the last time, no. 
 Genesis isn't a toy. 
 You of all people have seen how dangerous it is. 
 And so is the boy you sent to hell. 
 Eugene. 
 Can I? 
 You said once you'd get him out for me. 
 Yeah, well, that's not gonna work. 
 Not anymore. 
 Besides, I'm never going back down there. 
 We can't just leave him there. 
 I'm never going back there. 
 It's that bad? 
 Hell? 
 Where is she? 
 Relax. 
 She'll be here. 
 You were right. 
 Genesis is not a toy. 
 I was wrong about that. 
 Incredibly wrong. 
 Unbelievably wrong. 
 Stupendously --  but if the situation arises,  if there is a time i think using the word  will bring me a step closer to finding god,  I'm gonna use it. 
 That would be a big mistake. 
 Yeah, you guys said that a lot. 
 Genesis is a "mistake."  But I think it was meant for something. 
 Like what? 
 I said it before. 
 Told you back in annville. 
 It was meant for me. 
 Here she comes. 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Where's Cassidy? 
 He had to do something. 
 Well, I don't want to start without him. 
 Thought you were gonna change your shirt? 
 Jesse, i changed my mind. 
 I like that shirt. 
 I meant about getting married. 
 No, thank you. 
 um, guys. 
 Guys! 
 We're good! 
 Cancellation. 
 I repeat, cancellation. 
 I need the uribe and Hernandez party  at their places now. 
 You know what? 
 You were right about marriage. 
 It's stupid. 
 But you're the one that said that. 
 Well, then, I'm right. 
 Look. 
 I love you, you love me. 
 In the end, that's all that matters. 
 Right. 
 What do we do now? 
 We do the keep-looking-for-god thing like you said. 
 Hey, you the angel that's gonna help us? 
 Okay, cool. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, that's done. 
 Uh, I'll get Cassidy, and then we can go  and, you know... 
 Keep going. 
 Thanks for this, mate. 
 Ah, come here. 
 Ooh, all right. 
 All right. 
 That's enough of you now. 
 Goodbye. 
 Eh, right. 
 Let's go. 
 Heard about the wedding. 
 It's fine. 
 We agreed. 
 Bad idea. 
 Fiore: Careful with that one. 
 It's Cassidy's. 
 Did something happen? 
 When? 
 Upstairs? 
 With tulip? 
 Feels like something happened. 
 No. 
 Good luck with your search. 
 I never met god myself, but i hear good things...Mostly. 
 Where will you go next? 
 We're gonna follow the music. 
 So far, we don't know much about god. 
 What he looks like, who he knows,  why he left. 
 All we really know is he likes jazz. 
 So stupid I didn't think of it before. 
 If god likes jazz, what better place to look for him than... 
 New Orleans. 
 ...New Orleans. 
 sh1t. 
 Ready? 
 What should I say? 
 Find peace. 
 Find peace. 
 find peace. 
 man: Five minutes to curtain. 
 Curtain in five. 
 our deal...Still holds? 
 Kill Genesis and you'll see your family again. 
 tell me. 
 he can't be trusted. 
 I told him, but he's just gonna keep using it. 
 New Orleans. 
 That's where they're headed. 
 before you go... 
 I have another job for you. 
 I have to get out of here.
