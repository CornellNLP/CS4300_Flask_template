 Previously  on  When Calls the Heart... 
 Elizabeth :  I spend so much time focused on my future, I lose sight of the most important things. 
 Good to see you. 
 Jack :  He's a good man. 
 Elizabeth :  And apparently sweet on Rosemary. 
 Nora... I understand that my leaving upset you, and I think we can try again. 
 Jack : Welcome home. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Excuse me, miss? 
 Can you tell me what this is used for? 
 You don't know what that is? 
 Well, I've seen it around the kitchen. 
 It's a rolling pin. 
 You use it for baking. 
 Ah. 
 Do you bake? 
 Oh, I'm afraid I'm better at burning things than baking them. 
 Do you think it would make a nice gift for my mother's birthday? 
 Well... 
 I think women prefer something more personal. 
 Like perfume, or soap for the bath... 
 Things like that. 
 Oh. I see. 
 I don't believe I've seen you before. 
 I haven't been in Hope Valley very long. 
 I'm from Hamilton. 
 Oh. City girl? 
 Always wanted to live in a big city. 
 I didn't care for it much. 
 We just arrived a few weeks ago, from Rock Creek. 
 It's a nice town, but small. 
 Smaller than Hope Valley. 
 Are you following me? 
 Yes. [Laughs] 
 I am. 
 Well, I'm... going over there next. 
 Okay. 
 How do you like living here? 
 I like it. Very much. 
 May I ask your name? 
 Clara. 
 Clara Stanton. 
 Luke McCoy. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you, Clara Stanton. 
 May I ask you something else? 
 All right. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Bill. 
 Thought that was your horse outside. 
 Welcome back. 
 Just got into town a little while ago. 
 I got an alert yesterday, said there might be some counterfeiters working this territory. 
 That what brings you out here? 
 Well, I'm always on the trail of something, Jack. 
 Mm. 
 How's Clara? 
 She seems to be adjusting. 
 Has Abigail mentioned me at all? 
 No, that's okay. 
 I don't mean to put you on the spot. 
 I'm sure the whole town's heard about Nora by now. 
 You don't owe me an explanation. 
 You, uh, you have a description of these counterfeiters? 
 Might help me keep an eye out for them. 
 No, I don't. 
 Doubt they'd be working a small town like Hope Valley anyway. 
 Well, actually, the alert said they were working their way west. 
 You must be keeping pretty busy, given how this town's growing so fast. 
 Yep. 
 It's got its challenges. 
 Well, don't let me get in your way, Jack. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Elizabeth : And how is Clara doing with her sewing? 
 Oh! Busy. People have seen the apron that she made for me and the word is out! 
 Women are asking for alterations. 
 One woman asked her if she could design a dress for her. 
 That's marvelous. 
 She's so talented. 
 Oh, I'm hoping, if she can get enough work, she can open a little store here in town. 
 [door opens] 
 Clara? 
 Oh. 
 Abigail. 
 Hello, Elizabeth. 
 Hi. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Well... there was this man at the Mercantile... 
 And...? 
 And... he asked me to go to the ice cream social with him. 
 I see. 
 Clara! That's wonderful. 
 Who is he? 
 His name is Luke McCoy. 
 And...? 
 And he's quite nice. 
 And...? 
 And handsome. 
 [Elizabeth laughs] 
 Is there a problem? 
 Well, I told him I was a widow, but it didn't seem to matter to him. 
 Well... 
 What did you say about the social? 
 I told him no. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Okay, it's this parcel... right here. 
 This'll give us the inventory we need to handle our current contracts. 
 Oh, and I need you to file that application with the Forest Services Department in Union City as soon as you can, all right? Thank you. 
 Lee. 
 I have to read you something. 
 Um... is this gonna take long, or can I sit? 
 Sit, stand... It makes no difference to me. 
 "Louise Grant gives a  stunning  performance as Princess Marie in  The Pride of Jennico." 
 I can't believe that! 
 I can't believe it either. 
 Why can't we believe that? 
 I know that woman. 
 And she is a terrible actress! 
 I played Princess Marie myself once, and... 
 [stomps foot] 
 Well, I was terrific. 
 Why do I have a feeling there's a reason you felt compelled to come in here and tell me this? 
 I miss the theater, Lee. 
 Ahh... 
 The costumes... the applause, the opening night excitement. 
 The adulation? 
 Well... 
 I'd be lying if I said I didn't love all the attention. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But seriously... now that the sawmill is up and running, and there's new folks coming into Hope Valley, don't you think it's time this town got a theater? 
 Rosemary, it's a little more complicated than that. 
 You don't believe I'm good enough to run a theater. 
 Do you? 
 No! That not it at all. 
 Yes, it is. 
 And I am a wonderful actress... 
 [theatrically] who can  fill  a house! 
 But you probably don't believe that either. 
 Rosemary, it's not that either. All right? 
 Look, this is just a very critical time at the mill, what with this new contract and everything. 
 [Door slams] 
 That woman could give a pack of wild horses a run for their money. 
 [Birds singing] 
 She's been quite distracted since it happened, and she... she's really not open to speaking much about it. 
 Do you think she's concerned about honoring your son's memory? 
 I think that's a possibility, and... well, I feel like I want to be there to help her, but I don't know how to get her to talk about it. 
 What's your take on the subject? 
 If I were being honest... 
 I'm a little conflicted. 
 How so? 
 I want to be happy for her. 
 She's young and she has her whole life ahead of her, but I... [sighs] 
 You've never had a daughter, have you? 
 No. 
 You think it's possible you're being a little protective? 
 I suppose I am. 
 You don't think there's anything wrong with that, do you? 
 No. No, I think it's completely normal. 
 I mean, she just got here and you're enjoying having her around, and now you're afraid you may lose her. 
 How perceptive of you. 
 Do you think I'm being selfish? 
 I've never been one to judge people's feelings. 
 But, you know, I-I don't think that the memory of your son is what's causing her conflict. 
 I think that... what she's concerned with is hurting you. 
 I hadn't thought of that. 
 She is a very sensitive girl. 
 In my experience, I've learned there are two things you cannot have any influence over... 
 Young love and mules. 
 So my advice to you is let her know that you're okay with her dating, back off... and hope for the best. 
 I would say "have a little faith," but... well, that sounds like something a preacher would say. 
 [Both chuckling] 
 Thank you, Pastor Frank. 
 Just call me Frank. 
 Oh, I'm not sure that's appropriate. 
 After all, you are our pastor. 
 There's no difference between you and I, Abigail. 
 We are all the same in the eyes of God. 
 And people that call me "pastor" are just putting up an invisible wall that keeps me from my flock, and I sure don't want that. 
 Well, all right, then. 
 Thank you for the advice... Frank. 
 [Chuckles] Better. 
 Good day. 
 [shuts the door] 
 Mr. Avery, I'm quite busy, so if you'll excuse me. 
 Abigail... 
 You have some nerve coming here. 
 I'm only in town on business. 
 And before someone else said something to you, I thought I should tell you myself. 
 Well... now that you have, you can be on your way. 
 How's Clara? 
 She's doing just fine. 
 How's Nora, your wife? 
 Mr. Avery. 
 Clara. 
 How nice to see you. 
 Abigail tells me that you're settling in here in Hope Valley. 
 Well, it's had its ups and downs, but everyone has been very supportive. 
 Especially Abigail. 
 She's wonderful, isn't she? 
 Will you be staying long? 
 No. 
 He's just here on business. 
 Oh. Well, that's too bad. 
 I do hope we get the chance to see you again before you go. 
 So do I. 
 He's such a nice man. 
 [sighs] 
 [quiet exchange] 
 Bill. 
 Our banker just handed me this note. 
 Says it's counterfeit. 
 He's right. 
 Did he get a description of the man who passed it? 
 He said it was a busy time. The teller didn't remember. 
 I'm gonna go alert the other merchants. 
 No, no. 
 I'll handle this. 
 It's best you focus on your duties here in town. 
 Bill... 
 I'm getting the distinct feeling you have some issue with me. 
 I really don't, Jack. 
 But if you keep badgering me, I will. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [hearty chuckling] 
 Do you think you can do it for me, Hickam? 
 Well, um, Miss Rosemary... 
 I know it's asking a lot, but... well, it's just this one favor. 
 It's not that I don't want to... 
 It would mean a great deal to me. 
 Well, I... I can do it... 
 Oh! Wonderful! 
 But I don't want Lee to find out. 
 Yeah, me neither. 
 Considering what you're asking, I don't know if it'll make Mr. Coulter so angry he'll fire me. 
 [laughing] 
 No! He won't fire you. 
 I won't let him. That's a promise. 
 So... do we have a deal? 
 Miss Rosemary, you are one hard woman to say no to. 
 [laughs] 
 How true. 
 lee : What do you suppose that was all about? 
 With Rosemary, anything could be going through that head of hers. 
 I swear, that woman is a puzzle to me. 
 Never know from one moment to the next what's going to come flying out of her mouth. 
 This morning, she told me what a great actress she was. 
 You ever seen her act? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, you have? 
 I wouldn't be surprised if sooner or later she asks you to build her a theater. 
 She did! This morning. 
 No! 
 She did, yes! 
 I'll tell you one thing. 
 Once that woman gets an idea in her head, she is like a dog on a down-wind scent. 
 Hyah! 
 Excuse me. 
 Of course. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Are you sure this is all right? 
 As long as we're back before Father gets home. 
 This is gonna be so exciting! 
 You have the key? 
 Don't be so quick with those hands. 
 Been a pleasure talking to you. 
 Excuse me, ladies. 
 Do either of you know where I might find Elizabeth Thatcher? 
 Just down here? Thank you. 
 So, have you made a decision about Luke? 
 I'm just so confused. 
 Are you afraid you would be dishonoring Peter by accepting his invitation? 
 Well... 
 I loved Peter very much. 
 Oh... I know you did. 
 I went through the same thing, Clara. 
 Have you ever... 
 Opened my heart to another man? 
 Yes. I did. 
 Didn't you feel... 
 Guilty? 
 No. 
 Because I realized, if the situation had been different, and Noah had lost me, I wouldn't have wanted him to spend the rest of his life alone, because, when you truly love someone, all you want is for them to be happy. 
 I know Peter truly loved me. 
 And I know Peter would not have wanted you to spend the rest of your life alone. 
 Are you saying it would be all right with you if I went to that social? 
 Is that what's troubling you most? 
 Abigail... you have been like a mother to me, and the last thing I'd want to do is to hurt you. 
 Clara, you are a very thoughtful young woman, and I appreciate you considering my feelings, but if you want to accept that invitation from Luke, it is fine with me. 
 [relieved chuckle] 
 [door opens] 
 Working overtime? 
 Charles! 
 [sighs] 
 Why didn't you let me know you were coming? 
 Well, I know how fond you are of surprises, so. 
 I am not fond of someone suddenly showing up on my doorstep unannounced. 
 Even you. 
 I must look a fright. 
 You look lovely, as always. 
 Lovely? 
 After a day of teaching 20 children, all needing my attention, and now laden down with a stack of books? 
 May I carry teacher's books? 
 Teacher is just fine carrying her own books. 
 Of course. I forgot. 
 This is Elizabeth Thatcher frontier woman. 
 Totally self-sufficient. 
 All right. 
 You may carry my books. 
 Thank you. 
 But if you think you're going to get a better grade... 
 Of course not. 
 I'm fully prepared to work hard to earn that "A." 
 [Sighs heavily] 
 It's my father's pride and joy. 
 Well, after his daughters, of course. 
 I can see why. 
 I like danger, but we're skirting awfully close to the flame, taking this baby out. 
 Well, what's the matter? 
 Losing your nerve? 
 Heck, no! 
 I just... I've never driven a car like this before. Especially without the owner's permission. 
 Since when did you ever need permission? 
 For anything? 
 Julie, I think you're a bad influence on me. 
 I think you love it. 
 Shall we? 
 Let's. 
 Charles... why did you do this? 
 Do what? 
 Come all the way out here just to see me? 
 It will only make things very awkward. 
 Elizabeth... you know I would never do anything that'd make you feel uncomfortable. 
 I came out here on business. 
 Honestly, Charles. 
 What business could my father's company possibly have in Hope Valley? 
 
 
 
 Charlie? 
 Charlie Kensington? 
 Leland Coulter? 
 [Chuckles] Figured that was you. 
 City-slickers stick out like a sore thumb. 
 Good to finally meet you. 
 Likewise. 
 You two know each other? 
 Sure! Charlie works for Hamilton shipping. 
 I know that. 
 He's their top sales representative. 
 Yes, I know that, too. 
 Okay, well, did you happen to know that they're one of my first big contracts? 
 Yeah, Charlie and I have been sending telegrams back and forth for... quite a while. 
 Yeah, they ordered a whole load of lumber to build shipping crates. 
 Charlie's here to check out the operation. 
 I didn't know that you knew Elizabeth. 
 We're just friends. 
 Very good friends. 
 We go way back. 
 Mm. Okay. Well, um... when you get a minute, why don't you come by the office and I'll show you around? 
 Will do. Thank you. 
 Of course. 
 Elizabeth. 
 So, it's really just a coincidence that my father's top sales representative decided to start doing business with Lee Coulter, whose sawmill just happens to be in Hope Valley? 
 He did give us the best price. 
 Charles, I have known you too long. 
 Tell me... is there a good place to eat in this town? 
 Well, Abigail's has wonderful food. 
 Oh. Well, then, I hope you'll join me for dinner. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't this evening. 
 Ah. 
 I see. 
 You're otherwise engaged. 
 Yes. 
 Well, then maybe after I meet with Lee, you'll spend a little time showing me around Hope Valley? 
 Of course. 
 [sighing] 
 Oh. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Luke. 
 I remember. 
 I'd like to apologize. 
 For what? 
 Well, the way you ran out of the store the other day, I felt terrible. 
 If anything I said offended you... 
 No. It wasn't anything you said, Luke. 
 You were very polite. 
 Thank you. 
 [laughs] Well... I have some things to purchase for Abigail. 
 Oh! 
 Sure. Of course. 
 Well, it was nice seeing you again. 
 It was nice seeing you again, too. 
 Clara? 
 Yes? 
 Now that we got clear that you weren't offended by what I said, I was wondering... 
 I'm wondering about something, too. 
 You are? What's that? 
 Are you ever going to ask me again to that ice cream social? 
 Uh... Clara? 
 Would you allow me to escort you to the ice cream social? 
 I thought you'd never ask. 
 If it's all right, I'll come calling for you around 4:00. 
 I'll see you around 4:00. 
 [giggles] 
 That's all of it. 
 We hit six towns, including Hope Valley. 
 Nice take. 
 And the plates? 
 [Gun hammer cocks] 
 A lot of work, cleaning that money. 
 Never liked the idea of you just leaving us with the funny stuff. 
 [Horse snorts] 
 [Gun discharges] 
 I'd drop my gun if I were you. 
 [Thud] 
 You all right? 
 I thought I told you to stay out of this! 
 Bill, these guys were... 
 I had it handled! 
 You've blown my cover! 
 If I hadn't rode in, you'd be a dead man. 
 Get 'em tied up and take 'em in. 
 It was a bit of a shock, his suddenly showing up like that. 
 Oh, I made a complete fool of myself. 
 Oh! I seriously doubt that. 
 It's quite clear that Charles thinks the world of you. 
 [sighs] I know, but... 
 I just assumed he was coming here specifically to see me. 
 I've never been so embarrassed in my life. 
 Elizabeth, Charles cares about you so much, I'm sure it made you that much more endearing to him. 
 Does Jack know he's here? 
 I told Luke I'd go with him to the ice cream social. 
 That's wonderful! 
 Isn't it? 
 Well, I've been thinking it over and... now I'm not so sure. 
 Why? 
 Well, I haven't been on a date in a very long time, and never to an ice cream social. 
 Maybe I was too hasty. 
 I mean, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to even act. 
 There's no special way to act. 
 You just have to be yourself. 
 Clara, something tells me that that's not the real problem, is it? 
 No. 
 Abigail, the social is tomorrow, and I have nothing to wear. 
 I don't have any makeup! 
 I don't know what to do with my hair. 
 You can use some of my makeup. 
 I will do your hair. 
 I'll loan you a dress! 
 Oh, no, I couldn't. 
 Of course you can! 
 I'll even lend you some jewelry. 
 Elizabeth, I... I don't think... there's any use in protesting. 
 No. None. 
 And by the time we're through with you, you will look so beautiful, Luke may just faint when he sees you. 
 Or at least get a little dizzy. 
 Come on. 
 Ahh. Miss Rosemary. 
 May I help you find something? 
 I believe you can, Mr. Yost. 
 Whispers : I'm looking for a Victrola. 
 A Victrola? 
 I-I don't get many calls for those, so I don't stock them, but I could special order you one from a catalog. 
 Well, I would need it by tomorrow night. 
 Oh. Well, uh... special orders take at least a week. 
 No! 
 This is extremely important. 
 Not just for me, but... well, for the future of this town! 
 Miss Rosemary, I can't imagine how a Victrola could be that important, but if it is, I could lend my own. 
 [gasps] Would you? Oh! 
 That would be wonderful. 
 But you'd have to promise to take very good care of it. 
 I use it every night to play some records I just got with that new "ragtime" music. 
 Oh, isn't that music just divine? 
 Don't worry. 
 I'll treat it like my own child. 
 I-I didn't know you had a child. 
 I don't. 
 Whatever gave you that idea? 
 I'll be by later with a friend to pick it up. 
 Right. 
 [door opens and closes] 
 I think it's the beauty of this place that I find so uplifting. 
 That, and the honest, hard-working people I've met here. 
 I can't deny, it's a very different life than either of us were raised in. 
 And a good life, Charles. 
 A life where I feel valued. 
 You can't say you didn't feel valued in Hamilton. 
 You have family and friends who adore you. 
 Yes. I know that. 
 But there's a difference between being valued by family and friends for who you are and being valued by people for the contribution you make to them. 
 Your students. 
 Yes. 
 You know, there are students in Hamilton who would benefit from your work as well. 
 Yes, but the children in Hamilton have far more opportunities and far more teachers! 
 For the children here, I'm their only teacher. 
 The work I'm doing here can change their lives. 
 Give them opportunities they wouldn't otherwise have. 
 Don't you know how rewarding that is? 
 So that's the reason this place has such a hold on you. 
 Or is there something more? 
 [Sighs] 
 Didn't you say that you only came to Hope Valley for business? 
 You realize the liability of becoming involved with a Mountie. 
 I'm well aware of it. 
 You know I'm only thinking of your welfare. 
 I know that. 
 I think we should be heading back. 
 Bill : I'll contact headquarters. 
 Make sure no one speaks to them. 
 Why didn't you tell me you were working undercover? 
 It kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? 
 You were my mentor. 
 Since when can't you trust me? 
 Since you don't follow my instructions and stick your nose in my business. 
 You're welcome. 
 For what? 
 For saving your life. 
 [Horn blares] 
 Oh! You are a daredevil! 
 I will admit, I've never driven a car this fast before. 
 Let me drive. 
 You serious? 
 You can't drive. 
 Well, who says? 
 Well, have you ever driven a car before? 
 No. 
 But you can teach me. 
 I don't think so. 
 Oh, don't be a wet blanket. 
 I taught you how to tango. 
 Learning to dance and learning to drive are two very different things. 
 Driving this car is like taming a team of wild horses. 
 Then teach me how to tame them. 
 [Laughs] 
 I can't believe I'm about to agree to this. 
 All right. 
 [giggles] Yes! 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 [Engine fires up] 
 [Yelping] 
 Jack. 
 Charles. 
 Heard you were in town. 
 Some business with the sawmill? 
 Yes. Lee runs an excellent operation. 
 We've made a deal that's going to make him quite wealthy. 
 Tell me. Is it possible to get a carriage here? 
 I've decided to go to Buxton and get the train, rather than wait for the stage tomorrow. 
 You know, I wouldn't recommend it. 
 It's not the safest territory to cross for a man alone. 
 I see. 
 I suspect you've seen Elizabeth? 
 Yes. 
 She took me on a tour of Hope Valley. 
 Showed me the pond. 
 Beautiful spot. 
 It is. It's excellent fishing out there. 
 I suppose. 
 But it would appear that you need the right bait in order to catch anything. 
 Yeah. 
 Some fish seem to like one type of bait more than another. 
 Of course. 
 I suppose the question is, how does the fisherman know which is the best bait? 
 I find that people that have the most success seem to fish every day. 
 So it helps if you're a local. 
 And have you had much success lately? 
 I'd say it's been pretty good. 
 Charles... 
 I don't mind sharing one thing I've learned. 
 You don't need an expensive lure. 
 Just your ordinary, everyday live bait seems to be all you need to reel them in. 
 Thanks for the tip. 
 [Humming quietly] 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 Lee. 
 I think it's time you got to know me a bit better. 
 Good evening to you, too, Rosemary. 
 Now that you've got the sawmill going, you're going to have some extra time on your hands. 
 Well, as a matter of fact... 
 You know the old saying, 
 "All work and no play makes Lee a dull boy." 
 I believe it's "Makes  Jack  a dull boy." 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 But we're not talking about Jack. 
 Oh, good. I'm glad. 
 What I think what you need, after working so hard all this time... is a night out. 
 A night out? 
 Is that so? 
 And what I propose is, tomorrow evening, I take you to see something... you've never seen before. 
 [laughs] 
 Can you provide me with a little bit more information? 
 Actually, no. I want it to be a surprise. 
 But I can assure you it will be a most memorable evening. 
 Hmm. 
 Trust me! 
 Mm. Two words that get people into an awful lot of trouble. 
 I promise... You won't regret it. 
 [Elizabeth laughing] 
 Well, thank you for a wonderful dinner. 
 You're welcome. 
 [Both chuckling] 
 So I heard you saw Charles today, at the stables? 
 Yeah. We had a nice chat. 
 About what? 
 Fishing. 
 Fishing? 
 Fishing. Apparently, he's... quite interested in the sport. 
 I had no idea. 
 You know... 
 I thought it was an interesting coincidence that your father's company decided to do business here with Lee's sawmill. 
 I thought so, too. 
 Good evening, Elizabeth. 
 Mr. Avery. 
 What happened? 
 Ah, nothing serious. 
 I'm glad I ran into you. 
 Jack, I owe you an apology. 
 I was a little out of sorts this afternoon. 
 I should have said thank you. 
 That's all right. 
 What did you do? 
 Well, I guess you could say he saved my life. 
 Goodnight, Jack. 
 Elizabeth. 
 Jack! 
 What happened? 
 I was just doing my job. 
 What kind of danger were you in? 
 It was... 
 Mountie business. 
 Jack, if we're going to have any kind of relationship, I need you to be completely honest with me, regardless of the circumstance. 
 Elizabeth... it's not that I don't want to tell you. 
 It's just sometimes a Mountie's work is unpredictable and... 
 And dangerous. 
 And some of the things that... That I get involved in... 
 I'm just not at liberty to tell you about. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Thanks for coming in. 
 Enjoy the rest of your day. 
 Oh! You must be Luke. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 I'm Abigail Stanton. It's a pleasure to meet you. 
 Oh, won't you come in? 
 Why don't you have a seat right here? 
 Clara is still getting ready. 
 Thank you. 
 Well... 
 So, Luke, tell me about yourself. 
 Did you go to school? 
 Yes, ma'am. I graduated high school. 
 Great! And you have a job here in town? 
 Got a job today! 
 I'm going to be working at the Mercantile. 
 Wonderful. 
 And your family must have recently arrived. 
 I don't think I know your parents. 
 My dad works at the sawmill and that's what brought us. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Clara. 
 These are for you. 
 Oh! Daisies. 
 My favorite. 
 Well... you two better get going. 
 Yes, Ma'am. 
 I'll put those in water for you. 
 Thank you. 
 You look so beautiful. 
 Have a wonderful time. 
 Thank you both so much. 
 You really have made me feel like family. 
 Clara, you are family. 
 You two enjoy yourselves. 
 Yes, Ma'am. We will.

 [Lee laughs] 
 Well, where did all this come from? 
 I... built it for Miss Rosemary. 
 Now, don't you get upset at Hickam. 
 I kind of twisted his arm to do it. 
 It's all right, Hickam, I'm not upset. 
 I know how hard it is to say no to this lady. 
 Now, you just sit down, right here. 
 Okay.

 Oh, did you like it? 
 Did I like it? 
 You're incredible. 
 Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you. 
 Now, is it worth building a theater for me? 
 [takes a deep breath] 
 Well... contracts are coming in. 
 Shouldn't be long before we're turning a profit. 
 I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but yes, Rosemary LeVeaux, I promise, you will get your theater. 
 Oh, Lee! Thank you! 
 And I want you to know... 
 That's not the only reason I like you. 
 Can I trust you on that? 
 [Giggles] 
 That was great. It was great! 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [Quiet exchange] 
 Always wonderful to see you, Elizabeth. 
 For me as well, Charles. 
 And it looks like we're going to continue doing business with Lee's sawmill, so I suspect I'll be back every now and then. 
 I will look forward to it. 
 I look forward to it, too. 
 That's a beautiful scarf.

 Is that Charles Kensington Elizabeth just kissed? 
 Yep. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 I thought they were just friends?
