 Previously on "When Calls the Heart"... 
 Why is Jake Garrison so set on dragging you back in? 
 He's planning a robbery. 
 He killed a good friend of mine, left behind a widow and an 8-year-old daughter. 
 I don't have to listen to you! 
 You need to do as you're told. 
 You're not my father! 
 You said that you would be someone to lean on. 
 I have to think about it. 
 ♪♪ 
 (Elizabeth writes): For the years Hope Valleyhas been my home, it has become much more than that. 
 It's my inspiration. 
 Finally, I've found the heart of the story I want to share about this special place. 
 It's about the spirit of love and community here, how no one is judged by the past, how redemption is possible, even when it seems impossible. 
 I have the beginning and the middle... 
 I just wish I knew the ending. So, do you have an idea for your first story? I think I do. Oh, I wish I could write. You're so talented. You have to say that because you're my friend. Because you're my talented friend. And your nosy friend. So... you and Frank? (sighs) Me and Frank. Well? Well, Frank is a wonderful pastor, and I'm happy the town wants him to stay. But you're worried. I don't know if I want to get involved with someone who has secrets. Had secrets. Fair enough. What are you talking about? Grown-up stuff, nothing interesting. Cody, how come you're not dressed for school? I'm hungry. Get dressed and we'll talk about breakfast. I need you to pick out my shirt. Cody, I think you're old enough to pick out your own clothes. I can help you. I need you to do it. (giggles) (sighs) I'll be right back. Let's go, young man. (chuckling) You're headed out early. I got a long ride ahead of me. I want to let Carl Benson's widow know we got a lead on Garrison. Headquarters sent out a few extra patrols. Nothing yet. No sign of Jesse, either. Garrison's out there, Jack. He needs Frank. He doesn't give up easily. Neither do we. (horse whinnies) H'yah! H'yah... (♪♪) I have an announcement. This week, we'll be having a spelling contest. You mean like a spelling bee? Well, Robert, it's better than a spelling bee, because for this contest, you won't be competing against each other. You'll be competing against yourselves. What does that mean? Well, it means that everyone who learns all of the words on the board and gets 100% on the test will receive... one of these... with your name on it. So, make sure you get someone to help you study after school. All right, you may go to recess. I'm going to get my mom to help me study. I'm going to get Miss Abigail to help me. She's not your mom. So what? She can still help. It's not the same. Sure it is. You're not her real family. Miss Abigail doesn't love you the way my mom loves me. Miss Thatcher. Mr. Barrett, what brings you here? I'm looking for Constable Thornton, you know where he is? I believe he's on patrol. What's wrong? There's been an accident at the mill. It's Mr. Coulter. I did everything you told me. I guess it just didn't work out. Maybe I sent the wrong man. Everyone in the valley saw that wanted poster. Still, they wouldn't run him out of town. What are we gonna do now? If we can't get Matt, seems to me we might as well move on. All go our separate ways. Say, Lucky, why don't you show Jesse here what we do to somebody who decides to leave before I say so? You're not going anywhere. You understand? (wincing) Now, I stopped the bleeding, but you are going to need stitches. Well, what I need is to get back to work. You can't stand on that foot, much less work. Well, I can if you stitch it up. To be honest, Lee, this is more than I can handle, but if I wire Dr. Burns now, he can probably get here before the end of the day. Well, can I at least go home? It's best you stay here in town until the doctor arrives, okay? Well, I guess that's it, Wade, you're in charge until I get back. Please try and keep things on schedule. Yes, sir. We haven't officially met yet. I'm Mr. Coulter's new foreman. Wade Barrett. Hi. Lee! I came as soon as I heard. What happened? (wincing) Ah, ah, ah! The Number two winch cable... just, this cable snapped and whipped across my foot, but it'll be fine. (gasping) I don't want you to worry about a thing. I am not going to leave your side until you are back on your... foot again. I'll be fine, Rosemary. You don't need to stay. I want to stay. Well, thank you, I appreciate that, but I think I just need to rest. Of course you do. Rest is the best thing for you until the doctor arrives. Here, let me fluff your pillow. Whoa... There. Ow. Oh, one more. Oh! Oh, okay. Ow, ow, ow, careful. You just going to sit there and watch me sleep? Nothing is going to happen to you while I'm here. I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Okay. Just... just sleep. Shh. Yeah, okay, okay. H'yah! Excuse me, Miss. Are you by chance Lucy Benson? I am. My name's Bill Avery. I was a good friend of your father's. Is your mother around? Oh, um... my mother passed... just a few years after my father was killed. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Um, well, it looks like you've ridden a long way. Would you like to come in for some tea, Mr. Avery? That's mighty nice of you, thank you. Sure. You here to pick up Cody? He likes it when I walk him home from school. I can't say I blame him. I just wish I didn't have to run back to the cafe for the dinner rush. You're working too hard. You need to have some fun. I have fun. You ever play darts? A long time ago. Well, how about you and I see how much you remember tonight at the saloon? Well, I'd like that, but... My past is still bothering you, isn't it? Who I was and who I am now. I'd be lying if I said it didn't. (school bell rings) You don't feel comfortable spending time with someone like me? It's not that... Abigail, I don't want to push you into doing something you don't want to do. You're not. Darts it is. I love darts! When are we going to play? Cody, you and I will play darts another time. But it's spaghetti and meatball night! And Miss Thatcher said there's a spelling contest, and I need you to help me learn the words! I'll help you learn the words, Cody, and I'll make you an extra big bowl of spaghetti. You and Frank go have a great time, and we'll have a great time, too. Come on, Cody. Here you are. Thank you. Careful, it's hot. You have your mother's smile. She was, um... she was never the same after my father was gone. Seeing my father shot during the bank robbery, it was just too much for her. The reason I'm here is because... we were never able to find a suspect for your mother to identify. Until now. You found the man who killed my father? I think so. His name is Jake Garrison. I believe he's hiding out in the high country, somewhere east of Hope Valley. But, Mr. Avery, I mean, without a witness like my mother, you can't... There's no... Lucy... I promise you, I will personally see to it that Jake Garrison pays for his crimes, one way or another. Thank you so much. (crying) What about this one? Are you going on a date or to a funeral? This is the one. Oh, I'm not sure this is a good idea. No, trust me. It's beautiful. I meant tonight. Getting all dressed up, leaving Cody... Don't worry about Cody. He'll be fine. I know, but is this happening too quickly? Look what happened with Bill. Different men, different situations. Well, I'm not so sure. I thought I knew Bill, and really, what do I know about Frank? That's why you're going to spend time with him... to get to know him. (sighs heavily) Cody! Cody! Isn't Miss Abigail's dress beautiful? I guess. Cody, I won't be long, and you'll have fun at Miss Thatcher's. No, I won't. Sure you will. We'll study your spelling words, we'll eat spaghetti and meatballs, you can play catch with Constable Thornton while I shop for dinner. Don't you want to practice your pitching? I'd rather stay here with Miss Abigail. We will study your spelling words tomorrow, I promise. And... I'll bake you a pie for dessert. Okay? Okay. He's not usually like this. He'll be fine. (sighs sadly) Oh... (chuckling) You and this dress. So, how is Mr. Coulter? Oh, he's going to be better once the doctor gets here. Tell me, you ever think about re-opening the infirmary? Well, technically, the infirmary is still the property of the mining company. Well, I'm sure you could pull some strings. A growing town needs a doctor. I'll take that under advisement. That's not a bad idea. Let me help you, Miss. Jack! Faith? It is so good to see you. I was hoping I'd run into you, but I didn't know it would be this soon. What are you doing here? I live in Union City now. I work for Dr. Burns. He was busy, so he sent me instead. Um, this is our mayor, Henry Gowen. Nurse Faith Carter. I take it you two know each other. We met in Hamilton, when I took care of Jack's brother in the hospital. A pleasure, Miss Carter. Mine as well. Good afternoon. I shouldn't keep my patient waiting. I just need to drop off my bag and clean up a bit. Which way is the hotel? Well, I'll walk you over. Thanks. You moved to Union City? I did. I got engaged to a banker who lives there. Oh, that's great. Congratulations. (chuckling) Oh, Jack. You didn't think I came all this way just to see you? No, of course not. I hope not, because I was worried it might look that way, and I didn't want you to think... No, it didn't, at all. Good. What about you? Did Elizabeth Thatcher stay in Hamilton? No. She's right here. So you're engaged, too? We're taking our time. That's smart. I know there were things the two of you needed to work out. And that is all behind us. I'm glad to hear it. I hope things aren't awkward between you and me. I enjoyed spending time with you in Hamilton, and I want us to be friends. Of course, we're friends. That means a lot to me. Look, if there are any problems with the shipment, any at all... I got it handled, Mr. Coulter. Don't you worry. All Abigail had left was some tomato soup. It's not half as good as mine, but it'll do in a pinch. I added a little salt. I'm not hungry. (knocks gently) Hey. Help has arrived. This is Faith Carter. She is a nurse from Union City. Nurse? Where's Dr. Burns? He wasn't available, so I'm filling in. I hope you don't mind. I guess you'll have to do. I guess I will. I once played a nurse on the stage. What a coincidence. I once treated an actress for pink eye. (laughs) Well, looks like you're in capable hands here. I'll check on you later. Thanks, Jack. Nurse Carter, I'm afraid your patient hasn't been very cooperative. Really? I can't get him to eat anything. I keep telling her, I'm not hungry. And I keep telling you, a healthy diet is key to a speedy recovery... Oh. As I'm sure you're well aware. True, but I'm more concerned with cleaning and suturing the wound. Constable Thornton has already taken care of that. Mounties are trained in first aid. I know, but it doesn't hurt to be thorough. Why don't we just let her do her job, okay? Lee, save your strength. No need to chime in. Mm-hmm... What's the bell for? (gasps) Oh! That was my idea. It's for emergencies. In case Lee needs me, and I'm not right here. Are you sure you can hear it all the way down the hall? It's so small. It might not be loud enough. Well, I don't know. He hasn't used it yet. Why don't we test it out? Just to be on the safe side, huh? That is a good idea. Now, Lee, when I leave the room, ring the bell. Whatever you say. Okay. Whenever you're ready! Just a minute! Ha! Now, let me have a look at that foot. Pastor! (clucking to horse) H'yah, h'yah... Yeah, no word from Jesse, so no need asking again. Jake Garrison killed one of my best friends, and I stood up for you in this town when most people wanted you gone. So, the way I see it, I can ask any question I want. As long as we keep the subject to Garrison, that's fine. Convince me Jesse won't bring Garrison into town to get you back. Jesse won't come near this town if he's smart. Well, he didn't appear to me to be all that bright. He's had it harder than most. He lost both his parents when he was young. He kicked around a spell before Garrison took him on. He's not a bad kid. A little girl named Lucy Benson grew up without a dad because of Jake Garrison, so you'll excuse me, Pastor, if I don't turn the other cheek. He had nothing to do with that. Like I told you before, he's not a killer. Sounds like you got a soft spot for the kid. There was a time when he looked up to me, for all the wrong reasons. No, Jesse's old enough to make his own choices. I just pray every day he makes the right ones. You let me know if you see him. And I need some iodine, if you have any. You're in luck. That'll be $2.00 even. Mr. Coulter said I could put it on his account. I hope that's all right. I didn't catch your name. Faith Carter. Faith Carter from Hamilton? You must be Elizabeth Thatcher. Nice to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you. You, too. (sighs awkwardly) So, what are you doing in Hope Valley? I'm looking after Mr. Coulter. The doctor was busy, so he sent me. And you came all the way from Hamilton? No, I work at the hospital in Union City now. Oh. What brought you to Union City? My fiancé lives there. He's in banking. Oh... Oh! You have a fiancé. That's wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you. (chuckling in relief) Jack has told me so many wonderful things about you. I feel like I already know you. That's very sweet of you to say. Um, I'd better get back to my patient. I hope we have the chance to get better acquainted. I'm sure we will. Great. Thank you. Bye. Bye. How's that? Perfect. Hello? Hi! Hi. Oh, hope I'm not interrupting. No. Jack, you've met my new neighbor. Yes, of course. Wade Barrett. Hey. Wade was kind enough to hang this picture for me. It was good to see you again, Constable. Ma'am. Thank you. You know, I could have hung that picture up for you. I know you could, but I mentioned it to Wade, and he offered. Where's Cody? He's outside playing with Rip, and he's not in a great mood. He wanted to stay with Abigail tonight to practice his spelling with her. He really wants to get that certificate. Would you mind setting the table? Sure. So, I ran into Faith Carter today. Oh, you did? You met her? She's very pretty. Well, she's a very good nurse. I'm sure she is. Elizabeth, you know I had nothing to do with her coming to Hope Valley, right? I really want to believe that, but I think I might need something a little more convincing than just words. More convincing? Mm-hmm. I wonder what that could be. (door opens) Is dinner ready? Coming right up. Um, just wash your hands. 
 
 ♪♪ Is this how I hold it? Yeah, very close, just... Just... that's it, two fingers there. Just feel... just relax a little. Okay. Just nice and easy. Okay. Real smooth. Okay? Here we go. All right, give it a shot. Not bad, not bad. Try again, just... boom. Okay. Wow, that's what I call beginner's luck. I never said I was a beginner. You didn't even know how to hold the dart. I'd forgotten. Wait a minute, have I just been taken? I don't know. Have you? It seems I'm not the only one with some secrets around here. A little mystery can be a good thing. What else don't I know about you? Well, you'll have to stick around and find out. ♪♪ All right... That's not how Miss Abigail makes spaghetti. Well, it's Miss Abigail's recipe. But she doesn't mix it all together. But it tastes exactly the same. I'm not hungry anymore. Well... I'm not a doctor, but I think it's because you have a case of the giggles trapped inside you. No, I don't. Good. Because whatever you do, don't smile, because there's absolutely... (breathes out) nothing to smile about. Nothing to laugh about, nothing funny. Nothing at all. Isn't that right, Jack? That's right. You listen to Miss Thatcher. There is absolutely... nothing to laugh about. In fact, laughing is strictly forbidden. (giggles) Can I try it? Mm-hmm. Yay! (clapping) (laughing) I guess I'm a little hungry after all. (howls) (chuckling) (laughing) I don't remember the last time I was hustled in darts. Oh, I hope you're not mad. No! Mad? I'm impressed. (chuckling) I had a lot of fun tonight. Me too. Good night. Good night. You're back late. I didn't know I had a curfew. Business is better this month. Well, a growing town is certainly good for business, that's for sure. The question is, do you know what's good for you? Bill, if you have something to say, just say it. All right. I'm worried about you and Frank. I don't see how that's any of your business. Well, maybe it isn't, but that doesn't mean I can't be concerned about your safety. Frank had a past that he is not proud of, so he faced it. He faced all of us. Regardless, there are a lot of dangerous people looking for this guy. Well, then he needs us now more than ever. (windows smashing, yelping in fright) They're gone! I expressed my concerns about the situation with the pastor, but everyone wanted to pretend that it would be all right. Well... this is the situation that we find ourselves in. What do you suggest we do, Constable? (rowdy murmuring) Yeah! Come on! Okay, let's not overreact. No one's gotten hurt. Not yet. Garrison wants me. I'll find him, settle this thing once and for all. You go out looking for him, you're just going to get yourself killed. You know he's not going to take no for an answer. What do you say we arm some men and go out and outnumber Garrison? Sending out a mob to hunt down a gang of outlaws is a sure way to get innocent people killed. Listen up, everyone, If Jake Garrison wanted to hurt anyone here in Hope Valley, I believe he would have tried to do it by now. What he wants, and apparently he's succeeding, is to scare us into turning against one another. Garrison wants Frank to join up with him again. That's all. Now, I'm not going to let that happen, Frank. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to Hope Valley. And you're not alone. If they do come, we'll be ready. We can take shifts watching the streets. I'll take the first watch. As long as you just watch. No heroics. That goes for all of you. If any of you see anything suspicious, you come straight to me or Bill. Understand? Yeah. Good. I think you should stay away from Abigail. At least until this is over. At least? You know what I mean. Yeah, I think I do. This is about Abigail's safety, nothing else. Garrison will leave her alone if you stay clear of her. You're right. I'll stay clear. Until Garrison gets arrested. Were you able to get any sleep at all? A little, but it wasn't easy. Abigail, it's okay to be scared. If I'm scared, then those monsters win, and I will not let them win. Well, at least close down the cafe for a few days. I can't. Can't or won't? Maybe a little of both. But do you think that Cody could stay with you until this is all over? Of course. There's nothing to be afraid of, Miss Abigail. I won't let anyone hurt you. I know, sweetheart, and I promise, they won't, but it's important that you stay with Miss Thatcher for now. But don't you need me here? Cody, I need you to be safe, and to work on getting that wonderful spelling certificate. Come on, let's go pack your bag. ♪♪ Clara... Jesse... You scared me. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. What are you doing here? I came back to tell you, you have to warn Frank. Garrisons are coming for him. If he doesn't go with them, they'll kill him. You have to tell Constable Thornton. No, I gotta get out of here. You can't keep running forever. If Jake finds me, he'll kill me. Then you have to stand and fight, or you're going to be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. You can make a new life here, Jesse. I don't know... If Matt Landry can do it, so can you. He's a better man than I am. I don't believe that. I believe in you, Jesse. It's time you start believing in yourself. Right now, your friend needs you. Are you going to run out on him? How is he? His foot was infected, but he's going to be fine. I gave him something for the pain. It should help him rest. I think we got off to a bad start, and I'm sorry for that. Don't worry about it. It's very hard when someone you care about gets hurt. Still, I didn't mean to tell you how to do your job. And I guess I owe you an apology for that trick with the bell. (chuckles) It's all right, I probably deserved it. No, you didn't. Maybe just a little. Thank you for taking such good care of him. It's what I do. (chuckles fondly) (sighing heavily) Oh, Lee... I'm so glad you're going to be all right. But you scared me half to death, you heartless man. When I heard about your accident... I didn't know what to do. I couldn't imagine my life without you, and that scares me even more. What I'm trying to say is, don't you dare get hurt, and don't you dare ever leave me. It's been a long time since I've been in church. Well, things could have been different if you'd spent more time in one. Good to see you boys. Well, this isn't a social visit, Matt, but you guessed that. Nah, there's a gold train coming this way, and we need your help. Well, I don't want any part of it, but thanks for asking. (chuckles) Well... you better change your mind, 'cause I don't want to start hurting people, but I will, starting with that pretty lady of yours. You touch Abigail, and I will end you. Well... maybe I won't kill her, maybe I'll just bring her along for the ride. All right, Jake, you win. I always do. Pick him up. (gun cocks) Stop right there. Don't do it. (henchman groans) Frank! (shot fires) (groaning) You got this? I got it. (groans) I won't miss from here. Do I know you? Let's just say I'm a friend of Carl Benson's. Got killed in a bank robbery. Or so I heard. You should know you killed him, along with Silas Ramsey, and who knows how many others. You got no proof. I'll get it. Maybe not from you, but I'm sure one of your buddies back there is willing to talk. Your friend? He died on his knees, begging for his life. I guess he didn't beg hard enough. Well, you're not gonna have a chance to beg. Don't do it! Now, I know how you feel, but you cannot shoot him in cold blood. Watch me. Bill... he's going to get what's coming to him, believe me. You pull that trigger, you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison. Put down the gun, Bill. Put down your gun. Thanks, Clara. Miss Abigail! I was really worried about you. Oh, I told you I'd be fine. Get your books, I'll walk you to school. The spelling contest is today. Oh! We can practice on the way there. So it's over with Garrison and Frank? Finally. Are you all right? I think so. I'm going to talk to Frank later. You've been through so much. I can't imagine what you must be feeling right now. Well, they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Then I think you must be one of the strongest women I know. (chuckling) I owe you one, Jack. What for? For making me take my finger off the trigger. The Garrisons deserve to be locked away, not you. You know how hard it is for me to play by the rules. I do. That's why my days as a Mountie are over. You sure about that? I'm sure. Well, the Mounties' loss is the Pinkertons' gain. I'm won't be taking that job, either. No? I think I do my best work when I don't have to answer to anyone. Well, I'd have to agree with that. (chuckles) Well, what do you know, Jack, for the first time in my life, I get to choose to do whatever I want. Whatever you choose, I hope you stay in Hope Valley. I'll always have your back. That goes both ways, Jack. I know. I have never been more proud of this class. You all worked so hard, and it shows by your scores on your spelling tests. Yes, Robert? When are you going to hand out the awards? Right now. First up, we have... Opal. 100%! (Applause) Very good work, Opal. Thank you. Next up, we have... Cody. 100%! (applause) Miss Abigail will be very proud. Next, we have... Abigail, I'm so sorry. For what? For what could've happened. I can live with that, Frank. I couldn't live with giving in to fear. You don't scare easy, do you? No, I don't. Neither do I. You think you can live with that? I don't know, but I think I need to find out. Do you think she knows? I know she does. And she's at peace. So am I. Thank you for that. Mr. Avery? Would you pray with me? (chatting quietly) Excuse me. Faith! Faith, wait up. How's Lee doing? Fine. He should be back on his feet in a day or two. Well, good. Is something wrong? No. No, it's nothing. You sure? Maybe I can help. You can't. Bad news from home? No, no, not at all. Um... it's personal. I'm sorry, Jack. I have to go. Miss Abigail! Miss Abigail! Whoa, Cody, slow down. Where's Miss Abigail? She's out with Pastor Frank. Don't worry, you can show her your certificate as soon as she gets home. But I want to show her now. But she isn't here now. She's never here. She's always busy. Cody, that's not true. Who cares about a stupid certificate anyway? Cody, what's wrong? You won't understand. I could try. I know it's hard having to share Miss Abigail with other people. Would you like to know a secret? Constable Thornton told me that he didn't like it when his mom went out without him either, but it didn't mean she didn't care about him. It's not the same. Well, I think he felt a lot like you do. But Miss Abigail's not my mother! No, she's not, but... Anna says Miss Abigail can't love me the way a real mom can. Anna's wrong. No, she isn't. I don't belong here. Cody, that's not true. Yes, it is. I don't belong anywhere. Have you ever heard the story of the ugly duckling? Well, there once was a little duckling, and he thought he didn't belong anywhere either. And all the ducks and other birds would make fun of him, and... he thought no one cared about him. And then one day, he met a family of swans. And guess what? He found he fit right in. It wasn't the family he was born into, but it was the family he was meant to be with. You're a swan, Cody, and you found your family, and that family is Miss Abigail. But I'm not her real family, I just live in her house. No, you don't. You live in her heart. (groans) Ah... Thanks for the game. I hear Jesse's on the mend. Yeah, he's going to be all right. Turns out he did the right thing after all. You sound surprised. I am. I guess those prayers of yours paid off. They usually do. But you didn't come here to talk to me about the power of prayer, did you? No. I came to thank you for everything you did for me. Don't thank me, thank Jack. I had a score to settle with Garrison. I thought you boys were on the clock? Not anymore. Another axle broke on a delivery wagon. It's the third one this week. Looks like we're gonna miss another deadline. That must be bad for business. You're not kidding. First, Mr. Coulter gets hurt, now this? If things don't start turning around, we're gonna start losing a lot of contracts. And Mr. Coulter's not going to be happy about that. I don't blame Anna. I don't think she meant to hurt Cody. Oh, of course not. I just wish I had known a little sooner. Well, we've all been a little distracted lately. And Cody hadn't mentioned it to me until just now. I need to tell Cody that Anna was wrong. Children always know the truth when they hear it. Which is exactly what I'm going to tell him. I'm glad you're still awake. I thought you'd be mad 'cause I have school tomorrow. Sometimes, it's okay to bend the rules now and again. Do you know why you're so special to me? Because God put you in my life for a reason, and the moment you were here, I knew I wanted you to stay. I never thought about it like that. Well, think about this, I need you just as much as you need me, and that's why we found each other. Like the ugly duckling found his real family? Just like that. You're my real family, Cody, and I love you very much. I love you, too, Miss Abigail. ♪♪ I needed an ending to my story, and I found one. I found it in how the people of Hope Valley stood together to face their problems and their fears, whether those fears belonged to a whole town, or just to a little boy who needed love. Tonight, in Hope Valley, our hearts rest peacefully, and safe.
