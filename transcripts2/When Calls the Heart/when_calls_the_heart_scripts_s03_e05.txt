 Previously on When Calls the Heart... 
 How's Becky? 
 The fever broke, but her pulse is weak. 
 I'm going to need to bring her back with me to Union City. 
 The sooner I get her there, the sooner she'll recover. 
 Peter, I'm not going with you. 
 If you don't get on this coach, our engagement is over. 
 This is part of the broken cable that cut your foot, and that didn't break because of wear and tear. 
 Something's not right here. 
 Sabotage. 
 Here you go. That's a list of every employee who's ever had a job with me. 
 Anyone with a score to settle? 
 Not that I can think of. 
 I haven't fired anybody since we've been open. 
 We need to keep this investigation quiet for now. 
 We don't want to tip our hand. 
 I think I'll have a few casual conversations and see what I can find out. 
 Well, if it is really sabotage, we need to put an end to it, and fast. 
 We will. 
 I mean, I hate cutting back on shifts, but I really have no choice. 
 We're so far behind schedule, and now... we're losing contracts. 
 Whoever's behind this, Lee, is going to make a mistake. 
 They always do. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 I saw Florence this morning. 
 She said there might not be a service at church this week. 
 Well, it depends on when Frank gets back. 
 He's in Buxton, testifying in the Garrison case. 
 I'll be so glad when I don't have to hear that name ever again. 
 Me too. 
 Miss Abigail! She's coming! 
 Becky's coming! 
 She says she's getting better, and the hospital is going to release her. 
 That's wonderful news. 
 Does it say when she'll be back? 
 No, but this was mailed last week. 
 So it'll be soon, right? 
 I will wire Dr. Burns and find out. 
 Then we can all be together. 
 Yes. We can all be together. 
 (laughs) 
 Whoa... 
 Morning, Constable. 
 Oh, morning! 
 You're a lucky man to wake up to this every day. 
 That's what's going to make it hard to leave. 
 You still thinking about selling? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I'm going to move back east, live with my daughter and grandkids. 
 How much you asking? 
 I don't know for sure. 
 Depends on who buys it. 
 If it's a young man like yourself, who's looking to build a house for your new family, I'll give you a good price. 
 Well, I'll keep that in mind. 
 I've already got someone eyeballing the place, so if you're interested, don't take too long. 
 To buy the house... or start the family? 
 (laughs) Yeah! 
 Good day. 
 (♪♪) 
 I always thought it would be easy to be a writer. 
 There's so much to inspire me here, so many stories and characters that I want to share, but it turns out it's much easier to think of yourself as a writer than it is to sit down and write. Need a ride, miss? Miss? (laughs) Actually, no, I'm not in the habit of accepting offers from strangers. I'm a Mountie. You have to trust me. It's the law. Well, if it's the law... About dinner tonight... I'm not really sure I'm going to be back in time. Since Frank is out of town, I'm going to be going with Faith to the settlement to deliver some medical supplies. Well, maybe she has something for your memory. What's wrong with my memory? You forgot to mention that she's staying to run the infirmary and she broke off her engagement. Did I forget that? You know, it really doesn't bother me that she's staying. Faith is a really good nurse, and we need her. I'm glad to hear you say that. Come on. When's Becky coming? Dr. Burns told Miss Abigail it'll be soon, maybe even tomorrow. I wish I had a big sister. Then you can have mine. Thank you. You're welcome. What's that, Miss Thatcher? This... is... a volcano! And it's also an example of a project for the Science Fair. We're going to have a Science Fair? Not just us. Schools all across the west will be putting on Science Fairs, and a judge from the Polytechnic Institute in Cape Fullerton will be choosing the top five students to compete for a scholarship. I'm too young to go away to school. But you're not too young to build a science project, and the most important part is to have fun. It doesn't seem very fun to me. Well, watch this. (kids gasp, laugh) Ooh... Whoa! Wow. So? Are we having fun yet? Yeah. So how are things at the infirmary? Busy... but I'm not complaining. It keeps me from feeling lonesome. Well, you do have friends here, you know. I know. You miss Peter. It's hard to let go. Are you having second thoughts? No. He wasn't a bad person. We just wanted different things. So you're happy here? Happy... but also a little scared. Being in charge of an infirmary... it's a lot. I've never done anything like this before. Well, you're a strong woman, and you have the talent. You're more sure of that than I am. Well, that's because I've seen you in action. Mr. Coulter! Yes? I hope I'm not being too nosy, but I'd like to ask you a question. You? Nosy? Never. What can I do for you, Mrs. Blakely? I've noticed that some of your men seem to have some extra time on their hands. Is there a problem at the mill? No! No, no, no, just, uh, routine maintenance, that's all. We'll be up and running at full capacity in no time. Good day. Good day. Coffee, please. Lee! There you are. I have big news. I do hope it's good big news. It couldn't be better. The Omnigraph Moving Picture Company is coming to Hope Valley. They're going to shoot a motion picture right here! In the saloon? All over town. Isn't it thrilling? Yeah, I'm thrilled. It's called "The Reluctant Bride," and it's starring none other than Mary Medford herself. Lee! Mary Medford. She's starred in dozens of movies. She's very famous. If you say so. I do. Okay. And it gets even better. The director is Tobias Pope, and he is going to be auditioning locals to play some of the supporting roles in the movie. Ah, and let me guess, you're going to try out. Of course I am. It may just be a supporting role, but Lee, this is my chance to reach an audience a million times bigger than just... some tiny little theatre. Mm. Just think of it. All the world will be my stage! Ooh! (laughs) As if it isn't already. Here you go. You don't need all of those. I'm telling you to back off. Hey, let's take it easy. Guys, no one's going to go hungry. There's plenty of food to go around if everyone shares. Good... All finished. You'll have to change the bandage every day. You don't want an infection. Edith! How's Oliver? Taking a nap right now. It gives me a chance to take care of a few things. You look tired. Maybe you should rest too. After I get the wash done, and cook dinner. Ready to head out? Almost. There's a cradle in the back of the wagon. I'd like Edith to have it for her baby. I think that can be arranged. Let me. Thank you. Here we go. Oh, actually, it's pretty heavy. Your husband around here to give you a hand? I'm afraid he's gone. I didn't know. I'm very sorry for your loss. Oh, it's not like that. Roy left a while ago, before he knew I was with child. Have you told him about Oliver? No. I haven't heard from him since the night he walked out. Do you think that he should know? Even if he did, he wouldn't care anyway. Well, let me give you a hand with this. Thank you. This way. Well, looks like one of your tent posts is broken. Canvas is torn, too. It's nothing, really. Bad weather's coming. I'll bring some tools next time I come out and fix it. I wouldn't want you to go to any trouble. It's no trouble at all. Happy to help. How'd the trial go? It's not over yet. I gave my testimony yesterday, but Frank still has to testify tomorrow. My guess is, the Garrison boys'll be going away for a long time. I'm really glad that you decided to do the right thing, Jesse. You saved Pastor Hogan's life. You're a hero. I'm not so sure I like being called a hero for it. You'll get used to it. You know... I was talking to some of the boys at the mill, and they said there's a barn dance coming up. You wouldn't happen to know anyone who might like to go, would you? You know... I think Florence Blakeley loves to dance. I'm sure she does. I bet she's pretty good, too. No one does a quick step like Florence. Well, just in case she turns me down, maybe you could go with me? Maybe... (laughs) I thought you were having dinner with Jack. I am... if he gets back in time. Where is he? At the settlement... with Faith. You know, she's been terrific. I know. We're very lucky to have her. But...? I want to like her, Abigail, and I think we could be friends, if I could just trust her with Jack. Give it some time. I think you two actually have a lot in common. It isn't easy... What isn't easy? Eavesdropping on grownups, apparently. Can I go out and play with Robert? Do you have homework? Um... (door opens) Cody? Becky? Oh! They must have caught an early stage. Aren't you glad to see me? Sure I am. Are you okay? I'm fine. It's just taking a while to get better, that's all. I really missed you. (whispers) Why didn't you tell me about this? I was hoping she'd be out of it by now. Is it serious? The truth is, there's nothing wrong with her legs. Well, then, why the wheelchair? Well, she's weak from being in bed. Quite frankly, she just hasn't been motivated to put in enough of an effort. That's why I brought her here. She just needs encouragement and support. So you're saying it's emotional? She has to want to get better. Love from the people who care about her is the best medicine right now. Well, she will get plenty of love, that's for sure. I know she will. Mrs. Stanton, when I was here last, we spoke about the children needing a real home. I remember. Well, that need hasn't gone away. I was wondering... have you thought about taking the children on a permanent basis? I have thought about it every day, and I know that it would make Cody happy, but... But you're worried about how Becky might feel about it? I want to make sure it will make her happy too. She's been through so much, she might not be ready to make a decision like that. Well, the sooner she decides, the better. The social worker wants to place them as soon as possible. I will talk to her, and I'll let you know. All right. I'll say my goodbyes. Thank you for everything, Dr. Burns. Abigail... are you sure about this? So sure. I talked to everyone on the list you gave us, and it just doesn't seem like anyone holds a grudge. So it's not one of my men? I didn't say that. We still think the saboteur has to be an inside man. If he's not doing it for personal reasons, then someone's paying him. The question is, who would pay to put you out of business? Henry Gowen, for one. Tried to take the sawmill away from me last year. Yeah, I heard about that, in a poker game, but you won. Poker was only part of it. With all the fees and taxes he's slapped on me, it's a miracle I've been able to stay in business. Death by a thousand cuts. Yeah... Well, looks like he thinks I'm not dying fast enough. Based on past history, Gowen is suspect number one. But he's not the only possibility. You think you could put a list of your competitors together? We'll check them out. Sure, uh... it's not going to be a very long list. Uh... Tommy Northridge picked up one of my contracts. He also lent me a couple wagons so I wouldn't lose any other ones. He seems like a stand-up guy to me. Yeah, we'll talk to him anyway. I didn't know you were a writer. I'm not. I like to draw. May I see? Yeah. Where did you learn to do all this? My dad. Was he an engineer? He worked on the Queensland Bridge. I was building a model of it, but I never got to finish. And your father taught you all of this? Most of it. I have a great idea. Why don't you design a bridge for the Science Fair? Then you could build the model that you and your father never had a chance to finish. You really think I could? With your talent, you might even win the scholarship. I'm not really that good. Believe me. You are that good. It's getting cold out. Why don't we go inside and make some hot chocolate? I love hot chocolate. Me too. Would you like to try to walk inside? I don't know... I'll be right here. I won't let you fall. Maybe tomorrow? Tomorrow it is. It's all done. Should hold for a while. Thank you so much. I was a little worried the whole thing might fall down. Well, you need anything else, you just let me know. Thanks. Roy used to be handy at chores like that. He could fix almost anything. Is he a carpenter? No, a miner. Miner? He work around here? A friend said he got a job at the Silverton Mine, but I don't know for sure. You got a picture in your locket? May I? Next to Oliver's. Lord knows we had our differences, but... but Roy's the only man I've ever loved, and he'll always be Oliver's father. Edith, can I ask... did Roy ever mistreat you? No. It wasn't like that. He just... he just didn't take to the idea of being a husband too well, but it's all right. Oliver and I manage just fine. Whoa! You just need to straighten it out a little. There! Perfect. That should do it. Well, it's a good thing you have so many things that need fixing around here. Might have lots of free time on my hands if the sawmill shuts down. Well, that's not actually going to happen, is it? Well, I hope not. (knocking on door, door opens) Afternoon! I, uh, hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, Wade was just helping me fix the step. Always good to see neighbors helping neighbors. Let me know if I can help you with anything else. Oh, thank you. I'm right next door. Constable. Wade. (door opens and shuts) What? He's very... helpful. And very worried for his job. What's going on with the mill? Well, I can't really say. Can't, or won't? It's confidential at this stage. Then let's talk about something else. Like? Like your trip to the settlement. How did it go? Not so good. You remember the woman with the baby? The one Faith was helping? Edith. Her husband left her, before the baby was born. It's been really hard on her. Do you know what happened? No... But you're going to find out. Should I be worried you're starting to read my mind? Maybe a little. Well, can you tell what I'm thinking right now? I hope so. You haven't said a word all afternoon. I'm sorry. Sometimes I just get lost in what I'm doing. Oh, don't be sorry. 
 
 Miss Thatcher says you have a very special talent. Doing stuff like this makes me feel close to my dad. Did you used to do this together? When he had the time. Becky... I know that no one could ever replace your mother or your father, but... Dr. Burns was talking about finding a real home for you and Cody. I'd like to stay here, but... But what? Would you even want me? Why would you say that? Look at me. I can't even walk. The doctor says you'll be out of that wheelchair in no time. What if I'm not? It still wouldn't matter, not to me. I know that you'd like Cody to stay. Not just Cody. Becky, when you were sick, and I thought something might happen to you, I felt like I was losing my own daughter. I don't know if I can explain it, but... from the moment you and your brother came into my life, I knew that we were meant to be together... all three of us. You really mean that? Yes. You're in my heart, and that's where families are born. Does that mean we're going to be a family? That's exactly what it means. (laughs) Shot one, establish... Mr. Pope? Who wants to know? Rosemary LeVeaux. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you know my work. Can't say I do. Joan of Arc in "Joan of Arc?" Major Barbara in "Major Barbara," and the grieving widow in... Let me guess. "The Grieving Widow?" I've played the lead in dozens of plays, and I just happen to be available for your moving picture. Well, Mary Medford needs a maid. That's perfect. I played the chambermaid in "The Chambermaid." Not on screen. At the hotel, when she gets here. But I'm an actress. All the roles have been cast. Hickam? Is that a script? Yes, ma'am. Mr. Coulter cut back on my hours, so I figure I have some more time on my hands. Mr. Pope cast you? In the movie? Yep, and Mary Dunbar is playing my girlfriend. Mary's in the movie too? So's Molly Sullivan. Good ol' Molly Sullivan. Well, this is quite an operation you have here, Mister Northridge. Yeah, I get by. Lee Coulter mentioned to us that you loaned him a couple of your delivery wagons. Well, Coulter's helped me out of a jam or two before. You know, figure I owe him. We go way back. Have you heard about the accidents at his mill? Yeah... Heard they may not be accidents. You ever have any dealings with a man named Henry Gowen? Funny you should ask. Gowen came to me two months back. Wanted to team up to buy Lee out of his sawmill. I turned him down. Just didn't strike me as the type of man I could trust. You made a wise choice. Thank you for your help. Any time, gentlemen. Sounds like Lee's hunch about Gowen may be right after all. We've got to have some evidence, Jack. Let Lee know we talked to Northridge. I'm going to be back in a couple hours. (rings bell) Miss Thatcher! Me and Becky are going to stay with Miss Abigail! That's wonderful news! I wired Dr. Burns. There's still some paperwork to be filed. I will say a prayer that everything goes through. Can I tell my friends? I don't see why not. Becky, would you like to tell some of the other girls? Do you think they even remember me? Remember you? They can't wait to see you! I think Rachel's inside. Come on. I can't. It's okay. We'll get some of the bigger boys to help you. Boys? Would you mind helping me with Becky? Come on, boys. Thank you so much. Thanks, gentlemen. Excuse me? I'm looking for Roy Sampson? Thank you. Uh, Roy? Got a minute? Who're you? I'm a friend of Edith's. She okay? She's not sick, if that's what you mean. She send you? No. No, she doesn't even know I'm here. I'd like to talk to you about her. It's important. I'm busy right now. How about we get a cup of coffee on your break? I don't have a break for another hour. It's okay. I'll wait. All right. Opal... what's wrong? I don't know what to do for my project. Oh! Well, maybe I could help. Ephraim says science isn't for girls. Remember what I said on our camping trip? Girls can do anything boys can do. That's right. There are lots of famous scientists who are women. Elizabeth Blackwell was a famous doctor. Then there's Marie Curie. Becky! Emily Roebling was a field engineer on the Brooklyn Bridge. I didn't know that girls could be engineers. Well, they can. You're only limited by your imagination. So, tell me something that you like to do, something fun. I like to play with Brownie. Then why don't you do your science project on bears? You can find out where brown bears live and what they eat. Is that really science? Sure! It's the science of zoology... and this is a book just full of wonderful facts about bears, and pictures too. See? There's Brownie's cousin! (gasps) I'm going to like science a lot. Here you go. I have a son? His name's Oliver. I didn't know Edith was pregnant. I know you and Edith didn't always see eye to eye on everything, but I think it's time that the two of you talk things out. It won't work. You won't know unless you give it a shot. I made a lousy husband. Think I'll do better as a dad? There's only one way to find out, Roy. Edith doesn't need me. I think she needs you now more than ever. We gave it a try. It didn't work. Look... it's okay to be scared. I'm not scared. Leave it be. So Gowen went to Tommy to try and put me out of business? That's what Northridge told me. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. So what's the next move? You know, Lee... suddenly I'm in the mood for a little poker. You look about as happy as I feel. Is it the sawmill? Aw, it's nothing I can't handle. So tell me, what's got you so down? (sighs) It's this director, Tobias Pope. He's cast everyone in town except me to be in his movie. Molly Sullivan. Mary Dunbar. Even Hickam. What am I doing wrong? You're not doing anything wrong, Rosemary. It's not your fault that this Pope character can't see your talent. If he could, he would hire you in a heartbeat. Yes... he would. Yeah. That's it! What's it? Leland Coulter, you are the most clever man I know. I'd better get started. Whoa, whoa, whoa... started on what? Your plan. My plan? It's just genius! Mwah! Glad I could help. It's so good to see you. Very nice to see you too. Becky has made amazing progress on her science project. Yeah, but not getting out of the wheelchair. I'm not giving up. It seems like Wade Barrett's everywhere these days. He's a very nice man. In fact, I'm thinking of basing a character in my story on him. Well, every heroine needs an annoying neighbor. He isn't annoying. He's... solicitous. Isn't that just a fancy word that means he gets on people's nerves? Jack! I understand Wade is very valuable to Lee. I have to go. That sounds serious. Mountie business? No. It's... it's private. I see. Very mysterious. Yup, that's me. Man of mystery. So what's happening? Remember I said there was another fellow looking at my land? I do. Well, he's getting ready to make an offer. I just thought you should know. Mr. Besser, will you excuse me just one moment? Now... you were saying? Portia, from "Merchant Of Venice." Ophelia, from "Hamlet." Juliet, from "Romeo and Juliet." Just name the soliloquy, and prepare to be impressed. You do know that moving pictures are silent? Of course. Well, I'm happy to pantomime. Shall we start with Juliet? Like I said, all the roles have been cast. Mr. Pope.... I don't know what I have to say to make you change your mind. There's nothing to say. Now, if you'll excuse me... Have you ever wanted something so much that you thought your heart would simply stop beating if you didn't get it? Like some peace and quiet? And once within reach, was it kept from you by one person? Someone who could change your life if they simply said the word "yes?" D.W. Griffith... on a one-reeler called "A Sweet Revenge." He needed an assistant, but wouldn't give me the time of day. I saw it at the Princess Theater. I was doing summer stock. I didn't bother. Because you were well-qualified, and he just didn't give you the chance to show him what you could do. That's right. Well, then you know how it feels. (chuckles) If that was acting, you're better than I thought. It wasn't... and I am. In that case, you just got a chance to prove yourself. Really? Oh, this is just wonderful. I promise, you won't be disappointed. Oh, of course, I'll need a copy of the... script. Here you go. You'll be playing the saloon girl. Does she have a name? Yes. "Saloon Girl." I see. Well, thank you. Thank you for giving me the chance of a lifetime, the chance... Miss LeVeaux? I suggest you leave me in peace before I change my mind. Now that the divorce is final, Dottie said I could stay at her house for as long as I like. That's very generous of her. I gather things are sorted with your father, then? Oh, yes, he likes living with his brother, even though they fight like cats and dogs. Well, let the two of them duke it out. I'm just glad you're here. So, are you going to tell me why you brought me up here? Well, a gentleman named Clem Besser is selling this plot of land, and... I'm thinking of buying it. Well... what about your place in town? Well, I figure I'm about ready to move on to the next chapter of my life. How about you? I might be. Surprised to see you in town. Boss sent a few of us in to get supplies. I thought about what you said... about Edith and the boy. Your wife and your son? Yeah... Figured you could give this to her next time you see her. The settlement's just down by the river. It's easy to find. I've got to get back to work, so... Roy... you know as well as I do it's not about the money. It's about doing the right thing, about being a man. Make sure she gets that, will you? (♪♪) It's been some time since you and I played poker together. You always were interested in winning things that don't belong to you. Hm. I'll raise you 20. I think you're bluffing. It's going to cost you to find out. Raise you 20 more. Ante up. I had an interesting conversation with Tommy Northridge yesterday. Business must be booming for him. He mentioned that you were interested in Coulter's sawmill a couple months ago. Before you go barking up that tree, just let me make this perfectly clear to you that I had nothing to do with whatever happened at Coulter's mill. I didn't say you did. Why don't we drop the act? We both know what's going on here. Why don't you tell me? Now Nora's back in town, nothing you'd like better than to drag me through the mud just out of spite. How many cards you want? Three. What's your bet? I'm all in. I call. Queen of Clubs. Queen of Diamonds. Pair of kings. I'm not done yet. Queen of Hearts. Looks like I win. For now. So what makes you think Gowen is innocent? Well, I can't be sure, but he has a tell. When he bluffs, his eyes shift to the left. And he wasn't bluffing when you asked him about the sabotage at the mill? No, I don't think he was, but it's not hard evidence. Well, if Gowen isn't pulling the strings, then who is? That's a good question. (laughing) She's really having fun, isn't she? Mm-hmm. I just can't understand why she hasn't even tried to walk. (children laugh) Thanks. Do you think we're making things too easy on her? Maybe, but I think it's all right for now. You're telling me to be patient. She has to want to walk, and she will... when she's ready, not when we want her to be. Mm. (children laugh) I guess this tells me all I need to know. This is his way of helping right now. If he wanted to help, he'd be here, but he's not. It's my fault. I wasn't a good wife to him. It was hard for him. I should have been more understanding. Edith, you have to believe me. This has nothing to do with you. This is about Roy. He doesn't love me. That's not it. I think he's scared. Deep down, he knows he never should have left, and right now, he doesn't think he can handle the responsibility of being a father, but he still cares about you. I saw it in his eyes. No, he doesn't. He just feels sorry for me. There's more to it than that. Here. I don't want this. I don't want anything from him. Now, here... this is where I have a question. You enter the saloon. What don't you understand? But how do I enter the saloon? Am I happy to be there? Am I sad? Am I worried that perhaps there's an evil villain out to harm me? You're coming to work. Yes, I know, but what is my motivation? It's your job. Mr. Pope. I'm a professional actress, and I'm just trying to protect the essence of my character. Your character? (chuckles) Mm! Here's some news. It's not your character anymore, because you are... Rosemary LeVeaux? That's me. It is an honor to meet you. I saw you in "The Grieving Widow." Three times, actually. (laughs) Pleased to meet you, Mr...? Addison. James Addison. I own Omnigraph Pictures. The James Addison? In the flesh. Tobias, how on earth did you manage to land Rosemary LeVeaux? I've... always had an eye for talent. Lucky for me. Miss LeVeaux... how would you like to become a movie star? More bad news. How bad? The head saw's gone. Blown motor. It cut into a spiked log we took from the northwest parcel. I rode up there to have a look. Half a dozen of our trees are spiked. No sign of anyone, just some tire tracks. Well, that's it. Without a head saw, there's nothing we can do. There's no point cutting down trees. They're just going to pile up. I hate to say it, sir, but I think we have to shut down. I have never shut down a day in my life. I don't see where we have a choice. Do you? All right. Get the men together. They better hear this from me. Is there any dessert? Oh, I can bake some cookies. It won't take long. Can I help? You mean, can you lick the bowl? (she laughs) Yes, but do your homework first. Elizabeth, have you seen the new linens in the dining room? No, I haven't. Oh, let me show you. I want to get your opinion. Can somebody grab me my notebook? I am so proud of you.  Sometimes our smallest actions lead to our biggest victories. Watching Becky find the strength to try to break free from her self-imposed prison was both inspiring and humbling. It reminded me that despite our fears, we can overcome any obstacle when we allow the courage granted to all of us to unleash our human spirit. The future for Becky... for all of us... is known only to a greater power, but we help define our path by our strength of character, a truth I will strive to celebrate in all of my writing. Be good, and I'll see you after school. Have a great day. Bye. You be good. Be safe. Don't dawdle. (door opens) Hello? Oh! Hello. I'm running a little behind this morning, but if you give me five minutes, I'll put the tea on. You're Abigail Stanton? Yes, I am... and you are? Carolyn Connors. I'm looking for Becky and Cody Hastings. I heard they were staying with you. They are. May I ask what this is about? I'm their aunt.
