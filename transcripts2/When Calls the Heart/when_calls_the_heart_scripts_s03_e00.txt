 Isn't life the most peculiar thing? The twists and turns... the triumphs and failures... they all lead us on the most unexpected journey. I came to Hope Valley to become a teacher, but what I found was so much more. This town and the people here have changed me. They've opened my eyes to things I couldn't have imagined before. I found true love here... I've made wonderful friends here, some of whom have found love themselves. And while our little town can neither spare us from misfortune, nor shelter us from the past and the complications it brings, Hope Valley is my home now... My present and my future. 
 I've been looking everywhere for you! 
 The church is low on firewood. 
 I thought we were going for a ride after school. 
 Well, we were... but you had company. 
 How did... 
 I came to pick you up... but Charles was there, on bended knee. 
 How much did you hear? 
 Well, enough to know that I shouldn't be listening, so I left. 
 I told him no, Jack. 
 But he wouldn't have been there if he didn't think he had a chance. 
 I never gave him any reason to believe that. 
 Why is it that every time I think the past is the past, something like this happens? 
 I don't know. 
 Because life is messy? 
 Because people are messy? 
 Maybe some things just aren't meant to be. 
 You don't mean that. 
 I don't know what I mean right now. 
 Jack! 
 We can't go back, not when we've come this far. 
 It's over with Charles, once and for all. 
 I don't know if I believe that. 
 Then let me convince you. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Elizabeth :  They say time heals all wounds, but will that be enough? I wish we could go back and do everything differently, but here we are. As we say goodbye to Christmas, a new year is upon us. I can only hope the past stays in the past, and the future is something we cherish... together. 
 ♪ 
 Well, have you and Mr. Coulter made any big plans for New Year's Eve yet? 
 No. 
 It's going to be a quiet little evening, I'm afraid. 
 I'll take this one. 
 Very good. That's 10 cents. 
 Oh! I almost forgot. 
 This came for you this morning. 
 [gasping] Oh! 
 I've been waiting for this. 
 [gasps and giggles] I can't believe it! 
 Is everything all right? 
 All right? It's incredible! 
 This is going to be the best New Year's Eve in the history of Hope Valley! 
 Oh, Mr. Yost! Mm! Thank you. 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
 What was that about? 
 Beats me, but I am not complaining. 
 [chuckles] 
 Charles proposed? 
 I was totally shocked. 
 He didn't look too happy when he got on that stage coach. 
 That's because he isn't used to hearing the word "no" very often. 
 He'll make some lucky woman very happy one of these days. 
 Just won't be me. 
 Does Jack know what happened? 
 [sighing] Jack overheard most of it. 
 No! 
 Yes. 
 Okay, you and I need to sit down and catch up. 
 Was Jack upset? 
 He thinks I gave Charles hope. 
 Well, I suppose that's a natural reaction. 
 After all, he did propose. 
 Charles is a dear friend. 
 I knew his feelings were stronger, but I was always honest with him. 
 Well, it's not your fault that Charles misread your friendship as something more. 
 I know. 
 Jack just needs a little bit of time. 
 I don't blame him. 
 And you're smart to give it to him. 
 Thank you. 
 You've changed since you've come back from Hamilton. 
 How? 
 You know who you are now. 
 And who I'm not. 
 And now that I have it figured out... 
 Look out, Hope Valley. 
 Look out, world. 
 Well, that's strange. 
 I baked a pie, and now it's gone. 
 You probably served it at lunch. 
 I guess I must have. 
 [chuckles] 
 Anyway, who needs pie when there's so much to talk about? 
 There is nothing more to talk about. 
 Well, honestly... if it were me, I would've decked the guy. 
 It wouldn't have solved the problem. 
 Charles is like a bad penny. 
 He keeps showing up where he's not wanted. 
 He's still got some business with the sawmill, but if he ever proposes to me, then I really will deck him. 
 I'm not convinced he's ever gonna stay away from Elizabeth. 
 Aw, Jack. It doesn't matter. 
 Elizabeth only has eyes for you. Everyone knows that. 
 I hope you're right. 
 Trust me on this one. 
 Have a good day. 
 ♪ 
 You've already decided I'm guilty, haven't you? 
 I know what I saw. 
 It's not what you think. 
 What else can I think, Bill? 
 You had counterfeit money and printing plates in your hotel room, and that was after you were pulled off the case. 
 I did it for good reason. 
 I wired Inspector Houston. 
 He's gonna be here on the next stage, to take you back for trial. 
 You're making a mistake, Jack! 
 [sighs] 
 I wish I could believe that. 
 Well, I think we'll have to add another shift if we're going to make delivery before the first of the year. 
 Lee! I won. [giggles] I won! 
 Uh, give us a minute, all right, fellas? Thank you. 
 [Rosemary giggles] 
 Okay. I'll bite. What did you win? 
 The  San Francisco Herald  wants to do a story on how people celebrate New Year's Eve on the frontier. 
 Something that really captures the spirit of hard-working people, fighting obstacles, standing up for their families, creating new bonds and forging into... 
 Rosemary? 
 So they ran a contest. 
 Ah. 
 And? 
 I wrote an essay... about our dear little town, and... 
 I won. 
 Well! Congratulations. 
 So what does that mean? You win a prize or something? 
 Better. 
 They're sending a reporter... Here, to Hope Valley... 
 To do a story on New Year's Eve that is going to run on the front page of the biggest newspaper on the entire west coast. 
 Featuring... let me guess. 
 You? 
 Hmm! How did you know? 
 What can I say? Lucky guess. 
 Well, there is so much to do. 
 I need to get started right away, and I can count on you to pitch in? 
 Pitch in with what? 
 I made a list. 
 Of course you did. 
 This is not a list, Rosemary. 
 This is the  Magna Carta. 
 Oh, Lee. Come on! 
 It'll be fun. 
 A project for us to do together. 
 We've always made a great team. 
 Yay, us! 
 [laughs] Take a look. 
 We can talk about it tomorrow. 
 I can hardly wait. 
 What is this? 
 Fireworks. Champagne. 
 A marching band? 
 [laughing] 
 A marching band! 
 Where am I gonna get a marching band? 
 Elizabeth. 
 I've been thinking about our conversation. 
 And? 
 And I don't understand how Charles could've shown up if you hadn't encouraged him. 
 Jack, I was very clear with Charles, and I was just as surprised to see him here as you were. 
 Can we talk about this tonight? 
 Whenever you're ready. 
 And, Elizabeth... you were very convincing before. 
 ♪ 
 Inspector Houston. 
 You must be Constable Thornton. 
 Yes, sir. Welcome. 
 Let me help you get settled. 
 Thanks! 
 Congratulations on a job well done. 
 Well, it's never a happy day when we have to arrest one of our own, sir. 
 Well, I had my suspicions about Bill Avery for a long time now, but you were the one who caught him red-handed. 
 They set a trial date yet? 
 Not yet, but they'll expect you to testify. 
 Good day. 
 Good day. 
 A reporter from  the San Francisco Herald  is coming here, to Hope Valley? 
 Yes, indeed. 
 To enlighten the world on how we celebrate New Year's Eve. 
 But we don't really do anything for New Year's here. 
 It's a pretty boring holiday. 
 I'm asleep by 10:00. 
 Well, this year we are going to celebrate in style. 
 How? 
 [deep breath] 
 A grand ceremony in front of the church, with fireworks and a dedication for the memory box. 
 Oh, a memory box? 
 You mean like a time capsule? 
 It's a wonderful way to commemorate the year gone by. 
 The memory box committee collects important items from everyone in the town, seals them up, to be opened 100 years from now. 
 I would love to be in charge of that committee! 
 Done! 
 We'll also have an art contest, and the piece that best embodies the spirit of the New Year's will be placed in the memory box, along with the other memorabilia. 
 What about... planting a tree as part of the ceremony? 
 Yes! Dottie, that is an excellent idea! 
 And of course, we must have a program for the children. 
 Yes, a program... Something simple. 
 A recitation, perhaps. 
 I'll be sure to let Miss Thatcher know so she can get started right away. 
 Miss Thatcher? 
 Well, won't she be directing the children? 
 You'll be far too busy, with all of your other responsibilities. 
 Oh... dear. 
 Do you think she can handle it? 
 The sign of a true leader is the ability to delegate. 
 Of course it is. 
 Yes, indeed. 
 I'll make sure to tell her. 
 Rosemary : You do that. 
 Well, this is just so much fun! 
 Delegating. 
 So have you made any New Year's resolutions yet? 
 Have you? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 To be patient, to be kind. 
 Not to envy, but to trust. 
 First Corinthians. 
 My favorite passage. 
 It's not that I don't trust you. 
 Well, then what is it? 
 Charles is everything I'm not. 
 High society, social status... 
 I mean, you and he have a lot in common. 
 Only on the surface. 
 Jack, you said things could be hard for us, because we come from different worlds, but you also said we could face anything, if we do it together. 
 I did. 
 Do you still feel that way? 
 Do you? 
 With all of my heart. 
 It will be a new year. 
 This could be a new start for us. 
 Not to rush... to get things right. 
 Yeah, that's probably a good idea... 
 Not to rush. 
 I think so. 
 To proceed cautiously. 
 Not too cautiously. 
 To take our time. 
 And enjoy the time we take. 
 Well, I'm all for enjoying things. 
 [Elizabeth chuckles] 
 You sweeping the sun off the sidewalk? 
 Just getting the cafe ready for the big New Year's Eve festivities. 
 Those boys from the mill have a talent for tracking mud onto my floors. 
 Ah, they're just in a hurry to dig into your sweet potato casserole. 
 Well, it'll still be there, even if they wipe their feet. 
 Think I could convince them to take their shoes off? 
 [laughs] 
 I don't think their socks would be much cleaner. 
 [chuckles] 
 I had a really nice time at dinner the other night. 
 I'm sorry if I asked too many personal questions. 
 I think it was my answers that were the problem. 
 I was wondering, um, if you'd like to have dinner with me Friday. 
 There's more to the story. 
 I'm taking dinner to the Hendersons on Friday. 
 Jason's mother is sick. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 Well, perhaps another time, then? 
 Abigail! 
 It is so nice to see you sweeping and tidying up. 
 I wish some of the other merchants would have the same sense of civic pride that you do. 
 We want to look our absolute best for the reporter from  the Herald. 
 [laughs] 
 Well, I'll leave you two ladies to your work. 
 Now, I trust the church is going to be in tip-top shape for New Year's? 
 I'll let God know there's gonna be an inspection. 
 Abigail : Frank? 
 Let's grab that dinner soon. 
 Great. 
 Dinner? 
 Don't you have somewhere to be? 
 As a matter of fact, there is a decorations committee meeting for the New Year's Eve party, and then one for the tree dedication ceremony, and then there's the refreshment committee. 
 So many committees, so little time. 
 There's only so much of me to go around. 
 Such a shame. 
 It is, isn't it? 
 [giggling] 
 Clara, did Ned deliver those extra bottles of milk I ordered? 
 They were on the back porch when I left this morning. 
 I didn't see them. 
 ♪ 
 That's odd. 
 I have some news. 
 Good news or bad? 
 I think it's good. 
 Dottie Ramsey has invited me to stay with her through New Year's. 
 Well, that's good news, indeed. 
 [chuckles] 
 So, tell me, have you given any further thought as to what's going to happen next? 
 With Bill? 
 Well, it's a new year. 
 Perhaps it's time for something new. 
 I'm waiting till after the trial before I decide anything. 
 Well, while you're waiting, perhaps you'd allow me to take you to dinner?

 [whinnies] 
 ♪ 
 Elizabeth : As you all know, we have a big holiday coming up. 
 Even though New Year's is celebrated all over the world, what some of you may not know is that the new year doesn't start at the same time for everyone. 
 If you want to be the first to celebrate New Year's, you have to go to a place in the Pacific Ocean called Christmas Island. 
 And if you want to be the last, you have to go all the way... to the Cook Islands. 
 Now, in New York City, in 1907, they built a giant ball... and when the clock strikes 12:00, it slides down a giant flagpole, and everyone cheers. 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Are we going to have a giant ball slide down the flagpole here? 
 No, Emily, but our class is going to put on a special New Year's Eve program, and there's going to be an art contest. 
 Yes, Laura? 
 Does everyone have to be in the art contest? 
 It a lot of fun. 
 And there's gonna be a prize for the winner. 
 But we won't get started on that until tomorrow. 
 Today, we're going to learn arithmetic! 
 [moaning] 
 Shall we have some cookies first? 
 [class agreeing happily] 
 Miss Thatcher... there's a boy outside. 
 I've never seen him before.

 I don't see anyone. 
 He went around back. 
 All right, everyone. Please, stay in your seats. 
 Thank you.

 Hello. 
 I'm Miss Thatcher. 
 Would you like to join us for some cookies? 
 You can meet some of the other children. 
 ♪ 
 [school cow-bell clangs] 
 Have a good day! 
 And don't forget to work on your lines for the New Year's program! 
 Miss Thatcher, I don't think I can be in the art contest. 
 Why not? 
 Time to go, Laura. 
 Coming. 
 I thought you might need some help carrying your books home from school. 
 That's the best offer I've had all day. 
 Oh, I wanted to ask you... 
 There was a young boy who was outside the back of the schoolhouse earlier. 
 Light hair. About 10. 
 I've never seen him before. 
 Any idea who he might be? 
 He's probably just one of the new settlers in the valley. 
 I asked him inside, but I think I might have scared him off. 
 Oh, well, I was scared of my teachers when I was a boy, too. 
 Yes, but I'm not a scary teacher. 
 I don't know, I've seen your "scary teacher" face. 
 Jack Thornton, I do not have a "scary teacher face." 
 You better be careful, or your face might freeze like that. 
 Well, I-I know one way to make sure it doesn't. 
 What's that? 
 [Rip growls and barks] 
 Calm down, boy. 
 [growling] 
 What, did you forget to feed him today? 
 No, I don't think that's it. 
 [barks] 
 [growls] 
 [laughs] What are you doing? 
 I'm testing a theory! I think he's jealous. 
 Excuse me? 
 I've seen it before. 
 When I joined the Mounties, Tom got a dog, and when I came back for a visit, he wouldn't let me near him without barking up a storm. 
 You can't be serious. 
 Rip and I go way back. 
 Elizabeth : Well, animals love me. 
 Remember, at the homestead? 
 They named a cow after me. 
 I don't know if I'd be bragging about that. 
 Well, Rip and I are just gonna have to work things out. 
 I know. 
 Why don't I take him with me for a few days? 
 We'll be best friends before you know it. 
 [exhales] 
 It might not be as easy as you think. 
 He can be a tough customer. 
 Well, I can be tough, too. 
 Okay. 
 He's all yours. 
 [laughs] 
 Come on, boy. 
 How about you and me go get a nice yummy snack? 
 Come on, boy! 
 Come on! 
 [whispers]: Go on. 
 [door opens] 
 [door shuts] 
 Well, if it isn't the great Inspector Avery. 
 Should've listened to me, Bill, but you couldn't stay away, could you? 
 The case wasn't closed. 
 You disobeyed a direct order. 
 And if I were you, I'd start thinking about getting the best lawyer I could afford. 
 Not that it's gonna do you any good. 
 We both know who's guilty. 
 You're a crook, and you're gonna pay. 
 I'm going to enjoy watching you rot. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm looking for a friend of mine. 
 Matt Landry. 
 Landry... I'm not familiar with the name. 
 Heard he moved to Hope Valley. 
 Well, maybe check over yonder, by the river. 
 There're some squatters down there. 
 Thanks. 
 I'll do that. 
 Now, is there a hotel in town? 
 It's above the saloon. 
 Much obliged. 
 Come across this Landry, you want me to give him a message? 
 Rather deliver that in person. 
 Thanks for the offer, though. 
 If you were hungry, you should have just asked. 
 I'll put everything back. Just let me go. 
 Whoa, hold on, young man. 
 Why don't I get you some fried chicken instead? 
 I didn't hear a "Yes, please." 
 Yes, please. 
 Much better. 
 You're the boy I saw outside the schoolhouse, aren't you? 
 What's your name? 
 Thomas Edison? 
 Huckleberry Finn? 
 No, you must be Napoleon Bonaparte. 
 [chuckles] 
 No. Cody. 
 Where are you from, Cody? 
 [footsteps] 
 Can I have some potatoes, too? 
 Please? 
 This is good. 
 I bet your mom makes cobbler that's pretty good, too. 
 When you finish, why don't I take you home, and we'll ask her? 
 I'd better go. 
 Jack : Oh, hold on there, buddy. 
 Cody... we need to know where you live. 
 Your parents must be worried about you. 
 I can take care of myself. 
 Jack : Oh, I know you can, but it's not safe for you to be out alone this late. 
 I'm not telling. 
 Then I guess you're just gonna have to come back to the jail for the night. 
 What? No, I can't go to jail. Becky won't know where I am. 
 Is Becky your sister? 
 She's sick. 
 Honey, you need to take us to her so we can help her. 
 I can't. 
 Well, why not, Cody? 
 She says if I tell anyone about us, they'll send us back. 
 Did you run away from home? 
 I don't have a home. 
 I'm guessing you don't have a mom or a dad either, do you? 
 Abigail : Please, Cody... 
 I bet Becky is as hungry as you were. 
 A hot meal would do her a lot of good. 
 This way. 
 What are they doing here? 
 [coughs deeply] 
 We just want to help. 
 We don't need your help. 
 It's okay, Becky. 
 No, it's not. 
 Oh... 
 She's burning up with fever. 
 Okay, let's get you out of here. 
 I saw some other ones this way. 
 What was wrong with the last five we looked at? 
 Lee, the tree that we plant in front of the church is going to be the centerpiece of all the festivities! 
 It has to be picture-perfect. 
 You do realize, of course, that these guys are on the clock? 
 Do you realize what this story will do for us? 
 People will read this story and think what a wonderful community we have, they will want to move here, and build homes and open businesses. 
 We're ensuring our town has a future. 
 Miss LeVeaux has a point there, Mr. Coulter. 
 Do not encourage her, please. 
 Thank you, Hickam. 
 And who do you think they will buy lumber from when they are building their houses and opening their businesses? 
 I do like when you talk dollars and cents. 
 Follow me, boys! 
 Right behind you. 
 You heard her. Let's go. 
 Let's get this over with. 
 See if you can get some rest. 
 Make sure she drinks plenty of water. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 I'll be downstairs if you need anything. 
 She seems nice. 
 [coughing] 
 It's okay. 
 How is she? 
 I'd feel better if she saw a doctor. 
 But Dr. Wilkins doesn't make his rounds till after New Year's. 
 Ned Yost said there's a new hospital in Union City. 
 I'm heading to the mercantile now. 
 I'll wire the hospital and see if they can send someone. 
 Thank you. 
 Cody? 
 Where are you going? 
 Back to the camp, but I'll come to see Becky before dark. 
 Well, it's awfully cold out in the forest. 
 Wouldn't you rather stay here with your sister, where it's nice and warm? 
 I only have three pennies. 
 How much would it cost? 
 Well, I'm a businesswoman, so maybe we could figure out some kind of arrangement. 
 I'm pretty good at chores! 
 Oh! Maybe you could do some chores, in exchange for room and board? 
 Could I earn enough for apple pie at dinner? 
 Can you make your bed? 
 Sure can. 
 Then pie is possible. 
 Do we have a deal? 
 Yes, ma'am! 
 Deal! 
 Good morning, Miss Thatcher. 
 Good morning, Constable Thornton. 
 Whatcha got in the bag? 
 Nothing. 
 Just something I need to have repaired at the mercantile. 
 Oh, something I can fix? 
 No. 
 It's nothing, really. 
 Ah, it wouldn't have anything to do with Rip, would it? 
 [bag rustles] 
 [chuckling] 
 Your shoe. 
 I think it's time that he came home. 
 No! That would be admitting defeat. 
 Oh, and Thatchers never admit defeat. 
 Never! 
 What do you know about Laura Campbell? 
 I know she lost her mother a few years back. 
 It's been hard for 'em. 
 I can tell. 
 Jed's a good man. 
 He works from sun-up to sundown, but I don't think there's a lot of joy in that family. 
 [door opens] 
 [door closes] 
 Abigail sent over breakfast for you. 
 That's very kind. 
 Make sure you thank her for me. 
 Houston's the one who's dirty. 
 Not me. 
 Houston has been a Mountie for over 20 years, Bill. 
 My father knew him. 
 Doesn't mean he's clean. 
 It just means he's gotten away with it till now. 
 I'm telling you the truth, Jack. 
 If you let him take me tomorrow, there's not gonna be a trial. 
 He'll put a bullet in my back and convince everyone I tried to run for it. 
 Jack! 
 I'm asking you to trust me. 
 [kids chuckling] 
 Elizabeth : So the idea for the art contest is to create a drawing or painting that captures the spirit of New Year's. 
 What do you mean, the "spirit"? 
 How are you supposed to draw something that you can't see? 
 Well, it's not about what you see, it's about what you feel. 
 When I think about New Year's, I think about fireworks. 
 It makes me feel happy inside. 
 Good. So I want you to take those happy feelings and put them down on paper. 
 That picture of Times Square makes me feel like there's something big and exciting gonna happen next year. 
 Then draw "big and exciting". 
 I don't know anyone by the name of Landry. 
 Well, Matt wrote and told me he was in Hope Valley, but... doesn't seem like anyone's ever heard of him. 
 Is this Mr. Landry a friend of yours? 
 More than a friend. 
 My dad took off when I was 15. 
 Left me to take care of my mom and my little brother. 
 That must've been difficult for you. 
 It was. 
 But Matt loaned us some money to get back on our feet, and, well, now that the crop's come in, I wanted to pay him back. 
 Start the New Year with a clean slate. 
 Maybe our constable might know your friend. 
 Have you met Jack Thornton? 
 I don't think I've had the pleasure. 
 He usually comes in around noon. 
 Well, no sense waiting. 
 I'll go see if I can find him. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Who was that young man? 
 His name is Jesse. 
 He's in town looking for a friend. 
 He's very handsome. 
 Maybe Clara... 
 Clara doesn't need us meddling in her personal life, Florence. 
 Everyone's personal life could use a little meddling now and then. 
 [laughs] 
 ♪ 
 Miss Thatcher, is there really gonna be a war on New Year's? 
 I don't think so. Why? 
 Someone said there was gonna be a New Year's revolution. 
 I think you mean "resolution." 
 What's a resolution? 
 A "resolution" is a promise we make to ourselves to do something different in the new year. 
 I'm going to make a New Year's resolution to read... 
 That's a good one! 
 More  Captain Billy and his Bloody Pirate Adventures. 
 [class laughing] 
 How about a New Year's resolution to read more Dickens or Shakespeare? 
 [class groaning] 
 All right, we can talk more about that later, but, for now... class dismissed. 
 [cow bell clanging] 
 I'll see you after lunch. 
 Laura? 
 Why don't you take your assignment home with you so you can work on it there? 
 I can't. 
 Mr. Campbell? 
 May I speak with you for a moment, about Laura? 
 What about her? 
 Oh, no, no, it's all right. 
 She just doesn't seem to want to do the art project I assigned in class today. 
 I send my daughter to school to learn. 
 Well, there's more to learning than just reading and writing. 
 Pardon me for speaking plainly, Miss Thatcher, but you don't understand what life is like for people like us. 
 We  work  for a living. 
 Yes, but... being creative is part of "work" for children. 
 It teaches them how to communicate and express themselves. 
 That's your opinion. 
 Avery says there's two more sets of plates buried on the north side of town. 
 Oh? 
 He'll show us where they are, if the judge grants him leniency. 
 Well, personally, I'd throw the book at him, but it's up to the judge. 
 Where is he? 
 [sighing] 
 I don't know, but I can guess where he's headed. 
 He's armed! 
 Better take this.

 [footsteps receding] 
 Bill! 
 Got a minute? 
 Sure. What's on your mind? 
 Well, I'd like to know why you froze me out. 
 Not sure I know what you're talking about. 
 Sure, you do. 
 Why'd you keep it a secret about Houston? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Matters to me. 
 I've known Houston's been dirty for years, I just couldn't prove it. 
 You should've told me from the beginning. 
 It was too dangerous. 
 Bill, I have a job to do. 
 I wasn't gonna let your mother lose a husband and a son. 
 That's not your decision to make. 
 Maybe not. 
 You did exactly what I would have done, Jack. 
 I'm proud of you for it.

 Mr. Campbell! 
 Hello. 
 I want to apologize if I said anything wrong the other day. 
 Oh. You don't have to apologize to me. 
 I just want you to know that your daughter needs you very much. 
 She misses her mother. 
 I know. 
 But you still have each other. 
 You don't know what it's like. 
 No. I don't. 
 But I think Laura feels guilty about ever being happy again. 
 She needs her childhood, Mr. Campbell. 
 Please don't let what happened to her mother take it away.

 Pastor Hogan? 
 Hi, Cody. 
 What brings you here? 
 Mrs. Stanton said I could play outside before dinner, but I needed to talk to you. 
 Okay. About what? 
 My sister. 
 She promised she would come to see me at the New Year's program tonight, but she keeps getting worse. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Do you think you could say a prayer for her? 
 Because I don't think I'm doing it right. 
 I'm sure you're doing just fine. 
 You're a pastor, so maybe God listens to you better. 
 No, God listens to both of us just the same. 
 Well, when my mom and dad died, the pastor at our church said that God needed them in heaven, but Becky's all the family I have left. 
 God can't need her more than I do, can He? 
 Tell you what. 
 Let's do it together. 
 Sit down. 
 Two voices are better than one, right? 
 Okay. 
 I'm going to pray really hard. 
 So am I. 
 ♪ 
 I don't know if I got through to Mr. Campbell, but I tried. 
 The day my father died, my mom went on as if nothing happened. 
 She just smiled, kept going, made dinner for everyone. 
 I... I never saw her cry that night. 
 That must've been very hard. 
 Kids need time to grieve. 
 They also need to know when it's all right to move on. 
 I remember... feeling guilty about being happy, too. 
 I mean, for the longest time, I didn't think it was right to have fun. 
 Like Laura. 
 And when I see her and her dad, I understand it, and it brings back a lot of memories for me. 
 Of course it does. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't... I don't mean to burden you with this. 
 Jack! 
 We need to be able to share our memories with each other... good or bad. 
 Why don't we just concentrate on making new memories together? 
 [laughs] 
 ♪ 
 Welcome, everyone, to the first of many of our special New Year's Eve celebrations. 
 Later today will be the tree dedication ceremony, and then, this evening, the children's program, and, of course, fireworks at midnight, when we will seal the memory box for 100 years. 
 [laughs] 
 [applause] 
 And now, without further ado, Mayor Gowen, would you please announce the winner of our art contest? 
 The committee deliberated long and hard, 'cause all of you did such a marvelous job, but the winner is... "Sunrise over Hope Valley." 
 [applause] 
 That's mine! 
 You drew from the heart, didn't you? 
 Mama's our sunrise, Daddy. 
 She wants us to be happy.

 Lee? 
 Yes? 
 We have to hurry if we're gonna get the tables set up for the refreshments. 
 Rosemary, please relax. We have plenty of time. 
 I can't relax. 
 I need everything to be perfect for Mr. Ward. 
 Not everything needs to be perfect. 
 [words catch] 
 I finished setting up the launchers for the fireworks, Miss LeVeaux. 
 Is there anything else? 
 As a matter of fact... 
 Uh, Hickam... 
 You've done enough. Thank you. 
 You need to stop taking advantage of that poor boy. 
 He follows you around like a puppy dog. 
 That is ridiculous... I'm not taking advantage of anyone! 
 Really? 
 You are so busy keeping up appearances, I'm not sure you actually care about what's real and what's not. 
 Lee Coulter, you take that back right now. 
 No. 
 No, I won't. 
 Because, sometimes, Rosemary, life is about more than just the show, but you, you get so caught up in the performance, I think sometimes you forget about what's important. 
 That simply isn't true. 
 The truth? 
 So you do care about the truth? 
 Of course I do. 
 Good. 
 Then convince me. 
 Thank you! Thank you. 
 That's right. 
 Mr. Ward... 
 I have a confession to make. 
 Oh? 
 I haven't been entirely... truthful with you. 
 About? 
 There may have been a misunderstanding. 
 I bent a tiny little rule in your contest. 
 I'm not actually... [sighs] 
 Technically, I don't ha... 
 Ahem! 
 I don't have... 
 Have what? 
 A husband. 
 There. I said it. 
 I don't have a husband. 
 You don't? 
 You wanted a story about a frontier family New Year's, and so that's what I gave you. 
 But the real truth is... 
 I do have a family, but families come in all different shapes and sizes. 
 All the people here in Hope Valley are my family. 
 There's no better family anywhere in this country than the one I have right here. 
 You think I didn't figure that out? 
 Why didn't you say something? 
 I just wanted to see what you'd do next. 
 [quiet chuckle] 
 I assume you'll be canceling the story about Hope Valley? 
 Heck, no! 
 This story is bigger than "A Frontier Family New Year's." 
 This town is a place where people really care about each other all year-round. 
 Now, that's an angle my readers are gonna eat up with a spoon. 
 What? So you'll still be joining us tonight? 
 I wouldn't miss it for the world.

 He's saying goodnight to his sister. 
 He didn't want to leave her, but I reminded him how much she wants him to be in the show.
