 ( music playing )  _ 
 Sand :  How many times in the last year has the City of Yonkers been in this courtroom at the brink of a crisis of its own making? 
 Three? Four? 
 This case was decided over two years ago. 
 This court issued its remedy order 18 months ago. 
 To vote in favor of the overall remedy, as the Yonkers City Council has finally managed to do, is insufficient. 
 Yonkers must approve a plan to build specific houses at specific locations. _ 
 If Yonkers officials continue to ignore this court's order and by 4:30 Thursday do not approve 200 units of public housing to be built at specific locations east of the Saw Mill River Parkway, I will find the City of Yonkers in contempt. 
 In addition, I will impose a daily fine, beginning at $100 the first day and doubling every day thereafter until Yonkers is bankrupt. 
 This is the moment of truth, gentlemen. 
 Your Honor, I'd like to request a recess so I can confer with my client. 
 Well, it's approaching lunchtime. 
 Why don't we reconvene at 2:00? 
 Court stands in recess until then. 
 Clerk : All rise. 
 ( chatter ) 
 You can see we've worked his last nerve. 
 Nick : Yeah. 
 We don't have any slack here. 
 Gentlemen, enjoy your lunch. 
 DeLuca : You, too. 
 You know, to hell with him. 
 We appeal again. We go to the Supreme Court. 
 Win or lose, we take our shot. 
 Councilman Longo, what the f*ck? 
 I know, but there's got to be a way out of this. 
 This goddamn judge, he's shoving it so far up my ass, I can feel it in my throat, Nick. 
 Neil, he starts-- he starts fining us 100 bucks and doubles it every day, when do we start hurting? 
 The entire city operating budget is just under 300 million. 
 So working backwards, we exceed that on... 
 ( calculator clacking ) 
 ...day 22. 
 Clear enough, guys? 
 In three weeks, the City of Yonkers goes bankrupt. 
 Man :  f*ck. 
 ( chatter ) 
 At last, they see the light? 
 Sand was breathing fire in there. 
 Now they're singed. 
 Once they cross the Triborough, a little north of the Bronx, this thing, it becomes a lot less real. 
 It's like a bad dream to these guys, and they'll tell each other, "It'll all be okay somehow." 
 The good white folk of Yonkers give 'em a slap on the back and tell 'em, "You be courageous, stand up to those blacks, those Jew lawyers, goddamn liberal judges." 
 Ah. 
 What? 
 Hey. 
 I know, it just-- this case. 
 I swear, every time I worry I'm getting too cynical, I see I'm not even keeping pace. 
 What do you think of the new mayor? 
 The kid? 
 Yeah. 
 ( elevator dings ) 
 I'll meet you there. 
 All right, okay. 
 This is gonna eat him up. 
 ( man singing in Spanish on radio ) 
 Ah, muchacho. ( children chattering in Spanish ) ( woman singing in Spanish on radio ) One cookie each, please! ( music continues ) ( chattering in Spanish ) Roberto, don't let them ride in the street, please. Yes, Mom. Hey, guys, don't ride in the street! Carmen, here they're all in the street. I know, but if I pretend to yell at them about that, they won't ride on the  avenida. ( both laughing ) Carmen : Es verdad. ( speaking Spanish ) I still don't understand why we can't appeal the Second Circuit decision. You can. But you don't really have a leg to stand on and there are no constitutional grounds. But we could appeal, technically. Councilman :  And lose. Maybe the full Circuit isn't as liberal Maybe. - Judges Pratt and Miner were Reagan appointees. We lost on the merits. Look, here and now, you guys need to make a good faith effort to comply with Sand. Come up with a plan you can live with and stick to it. I think the judge is pretty much wedded to the four School sites. You know, the School 30 site is right behind my house over by Nevada Avenue. And I already got a site in my district. Don't look at me. I already ate the Walt Whitman School site. Yeah, you know what? I got news for you. All right, we're gonna lose Nevada Avenue or we got no deal. If I have to, I could live with a small site, you know, down on Midland, over by Sarah Lawrence, but not, you know, in my backyard. ( chuckling ) You did not just-- That is actually my backyard. Look, this train's left the station. We're your lawyers. We're just trying to prevent a wreck. Chema :  If we do it now, early in the term,  it'll get hot for a while, but it'll cool down before the next election. ( scoffs ) Jesus, this is a bitch. Hey, it's what they pay us the big bucks for, right? ( grunts ) She said we could stay here till the baby comes. ( woman yelling indistinctly ) She's cool with it. You'll see. Never been over this way before. Yeah, well, they built Mulford a long time back. When they opened it, it was all white people. When Gammy moved in, it was still mostly white people. You know we're gonna need more than one room when the baby comes. Look, we ain't gonna be here forever. ( music blaring ) Now, what you doin'? You ain't gonna help out? No, I like a man carrying stuff for me. You like this, huh? Yeah. Oh, okay. Check this out. ( grunts ) Whoo! Yeah, baby. ( laughs ) Ooh, watch out. Damn, boy. Whoo. Baby. ( coughs ) You got it. You like that? Good job, babe. Please be seated. Mr. McAmis? Your Honor. The City of Yonkers understands the gravity of the situation. After conferring for the past four hours, the mayor and council majority here have agreed to meet in a special session tomorrow  to approve a plan of 200 units of public housing at specific sites. In addition, Your Honor, Mayor Wasicsko, himself a member of the bar, would like to address the court. Very well. Mr. Mayor? Thank you, Your Honor. Um, Your Honor, a majority of the Yonkers City Council supports making the housing commitment and negotiating a building plan, and I just want to assure you that the city will obey the law. Well, I appreciate that, Mayor Wasicsko, I do. But let me say this-- we have been here before with Yonkers. Four years ago and six years ago we came to the brink of a settlement in this case before the City Council balked at building  even a single unit of low-income housing. In light of that, the council must approve a housing plan Yes, Your Honor. Sand :  Mr. McAmis, the court will expect... Goddamn sellout. ...immediately following the council vote. McAmis :  Yes, Your Honor. Yonkers officials agreed to comply with the federal desegregation order  after the judge threatened fines that would bankrupt the city. We are making these concessions in order to save the city from enormous fines and contempt. Reporter :  But even opponents... They talking about building those here? I think so. We were double-crossed by the councilmen in there today. They promised people they wouldn't give in and they folded. Reporter :  And city officials must still identify specific sites... Did you pick up-- Shh, please. ...for another deadline set by the judge. I think we'll have a resolution by Monday one way or the other. Now, there are some proposed sites that are still on the table, but the ball is squarely in the City of Yonkers' court. ( chuckles ) Reporter :  I'm Virginia Kim, Cablevision News, Westchester. Chicken's overcooked again, isn't it? News anchor :  Turning to sports, the New York Knicks take on the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight... Buddy? The Knicks have had big trouble on the road this year... No, it's fine. It's real-- it's great, actually. So Martinelli was right. About the housing? Yeah, about the housing. He said we had to build it, and guess what? We gotta build it. ( chuckles ) It's just an appeal is a waste of money. I mean, there's no getting around this goddamned judge. You didn't know all that when you ran against him. Right? ( music playing ) I don't know. Maybe I didn't want to know. You know what? We can get past this. We can. I just got to, uh, get everybody on board, convince the rest of the council that the law is the law. ( chuckles ) I think you're gonna be a great mayor. Yeah? I think so. ♪ I just want to say ♪ 
♪ this is my way of telling you... ♪ Nick :  You weren't there. You don't know how angry this judge is. Oh, he's angry? He ain't the only one. I'm for taking this to the Supreme Court, appealing all the way. Councilman, we don't have a chance before the Supreme Court. We need to offer them a housing plan-- A housing plan? Sure. Here's my housing plan. No low-income housing. If they can afford a house, great. If not-- We're past that, Hank. That argument was heard and it lost. If we don't offer a plan, the judge is gonna hold  the city, all of us, in contempt. He can fine us, jail us-- This judge ain't the Pope. We're talking due process here. All right, sit down, Hank. Let's agree on something we can all support. I ain't supporting nothing. ( chuckles ) He's not supporting nothing? Oh, God. Well, as we've been intimating, Mr. Spallone's just doubled the number of housing units coming to his district. Longo : What a gaping asshole. Hank's gonna grandstand the sh1t out of this. No, Daddy. No, no, she was here this morning, but I think she went to, um-- she went to work this afternoon. Where? Work. I think she went to work, Daddy. All right. Mm-hmm. ( music blaring ) If I see her, I sure will. All right, then. All right. Love to Mama. All right. Love you. ( beeps ) I don't like lying to him. ( coughs ) Hey, Skip. Hey, what's up? Breakout down. You making money today, ain't ya? ( scoffs ) As long as the young'un ain't f*cked the count up. Who? Dante. Boy in the blue. He been f*cking up, huh? Every goddamn day. ( police siren chirping ) Gary :  Oh, sh1t. 5-0 checking. They're hitting up Frankie's crew. I said turn around! Turn around! Yo, I'm paying this m*therf*cker over here to be the lookout  and he got his f*cking hand in his pocket rubbing his goddamned nuts. sh1t. Yo, pick it up and go. Casual. Ignorant m*therf*cker. Pick it up. Pick my sh1t up. Now. God damn! What the-- Hey! Hey, you, freeze! 5-0 on you, Skip. ( helicopter blades whirring ) Yo, yo, yo! ( Skip coughing, wheezing ) Run back, tell my sister to dial 911. ( raspy ) No. You can't breathe! You call an ambo and the police are gonna come with. ( coughing ) Just let me be. ( police sirens wailing ) ( music playing ) There's my girl. Hey. Hey, how's the Bronxville Bomber? Huh? Oh. Thanks for coming out. You sounded pretty down, Vinni. Oh, yeah. I don't know. I just, uh-- I felt like I-- I just needed to talk to someone. Someone other than myself. ( chuckles ) Hi. A Stoli and tonic with a twist of lime, please. - Sure. Another one of those? Uh, yeah. Just no lime. Menus? No, thank you. Uh... What's going on? I don't know. I just, uh-- I'm just feeling a little lost. Adrift, maybe, just being out so suddenly. Right. Well, you're working at the photography shop, right? Yeah. Family is...? Yeah, good. You know. Yeah? It's different. It's like, when you're out of office, it's like your candle goes out, you know? And everyone just moves on to the next candle. And, uh... people stop calling and reporters stop trying to reach you and, uh... it's back to your life. Yeah. But you're reading the paper and you're watching TV, so you know what's going on. You know what? I think you might've been the lucky one in this situation because this housing sh1t... the judge, Spallone, Longo... Oh, f*ck Nick Longo. He should get ass cancer. ( laughs ) sh1t. Well, I definitely would prefer you in that seat than him, but what are you-- what are we gonna do? They redistricted us. From 12 seats down to six, you know? Some of us were gonna fall. ( exhales ) Yeah, but... it hurts to lose. You tell yourself it's not personal, but... Right. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Ahem. Yeah, I know. I have my family, I have a phenomenal relationship with my kids. I love them to death. But, uh, the whole time I'm thinking, "My God, there's a whole part of my life that's not gonna be there anymore." It's just politics, Vinni. It's addictive is what it is. Once you get that taste in your mouth, I mean... I've, uh-- ( sniffles ) I've even thought... You can think some pretty dark sh1t when they make you walk away. ( Vinni chuckles ) You're all right. ( sniffles ) You're all right. Yeah, how's Nay? Good? Stressed. Yeah, me, too. Oh, you know, I miss the stress. Yeah, well... Give me your stress. I want the stress. ( laughing ) All right, just get Nevada Avenue off the goddamn list. All right? That's all I'm asking. Well, look at the f*cking seminary, then. St. Joseph's? Yes. What-- didn't we already object to that in the earlier court filings? Yeah, well, that was then, this is now. I could talk to the cardinal about it. I'm on the boards of St. Patrick's and Catholic Charities. I see him enough. Wait, wait, wait. You really think? Look, let's just put it down as tentative for now. Fine. Judge, you'll talk to the cardinal? Yes. Okay, well, that's one site down, maybe. McAmis :  That's a start. DeLuca :  Seven to go. ( typewriters clacking ) Oh, my God. "You won't see the next one." Oh, Jesus. Mine's bigger. ( chuckles ) Hey, you get yours yet? My bullet? Yep. You see that guy over there? That's your new best friend, Nick. He's gonna follow you home after the meeting, stay outside your house, and follow you back to work tomorrow. Round the clock. Well, I feel so special. You're not. The other good-vote council members get police escorts, too. For everybody else, tomorrow we put in metal detectors. All visitors start signing in and out. Hey, this mayor thing? When's the fun part start? Okay. ( speaking Spanish ) - 260. 260? That much? 25 each of these, 75. Plus 45, four of these for 15.60, and the chicken, 80. 260. Okay. ( music playing ) Leave this, I'll pay for the rest. Okay. 165. Maria. But I want candy. We have at home. ( chatter in Spanish ) And finally the last site would be at Midland and Theresa Avenues, making for a total of seven agreed-upon sites, so-- Cardinal's on the line, Your Honor. Thank you. Your Eminence, Judge Sand here. Good morning. How are you? Cardinal :  Just fine, Judge. And you? Very good. I have here in chambers lawyers for the City of Yonkers and from the Department of Justice and the NAACP. I just want to make sure we all understand each other. Certainly, Judge Sand. Go ahead. The city's lawyers, Judge Mulligan among them, tell me that the archdiocese has agreed to let the city build 16 low-income housing units at St. Joseph's Seminary off Valentine Street. That's right. Bill and I have talked about a sliver of the site for the housing and perhaps a bit more for a playground. I see, Your Eminence. If you have a problem with this proposal-- a political problem-- Oh, no, no, I understand the proposal and I'm prepared to do it. It's a help to the poor and consistent with the mission of the archdiocese. Once everything's finalized on your end, let us know and we'll release a statement. Will do, Your Eminence. Thank you. Not at all. We'll be in touch. ( phone clicks ) Done. ( chuckles ) Wait, which one did you say was Hobart again? Uh, 3F. Right there. Yeah, that one. Now, there. Yeah. That way I'll be able to tell when you're not here to help me. Yeah, I got practice Tuesday at the rec. You know, I could miss it, but that'd mean I'd have to quit the team. No, no, no, no. I'll make do on Tuesday. All right. Can you wait on me? Jesus Christ, did you read this quote from Fagan? About the judge? ( scoffs ) If I knew you'd be so little help, I would never have agreed to move in with you. I put the bed together. What else do you and me need in a new apartment? ( scoffs ) If my father heard you talk like that, he'd kill you twice. ( laughs ) Yeah, he's already mad at me, moving in with a guy and no ring on my finger. Ah, I'll win him over like any other constituent. You'll see. ♪ now, some may want to die, young man... ♪ You should come to bed. Tomorrow's gonna be a long day. ( sighs ) Tomorrow is gonna be hell. ♪ hey, buddy, that ain't me... ♪ ( crowd shouting, booing ) Cola :  That's-- that's--  that's the only plan that makes sense for the city. Thank you, Councilman. Mr. Spallone? You know, I'm not like these wimps who are kowtowing to some judge who's off the friggin' wall. ( crowd cheering ) I'm not wearing Pampers. I swore an allegiance to you, the voters, and I'm gonna keep that allegiance to you, and I got a message for Judge Sands. Nuts to Judge Sands. You wanna take me away? Come get me! ( cheering ) Great, we're one wing nut away from a riot. Tell me about it. They confiscated four guns at the door. I wonder which one of these bastards sent the bullets. Uh, we're here to take testimony from the citizens of Yonkers...  ( scattered booing )  ...regarding the housing site plan. ( booing, shouting ) Those who have signed up and wish to make a statement may proceed to the podium in the proper order. What I'd like to know is whatever happened to majority rule, huh? Crowd : Yeah! Isn't this still America? Crowd : Yeah! A bunch of wimps is what you all are! It's about these public housing people  bringing drugs and crime into our neighborhood  and ruining our property values! You promised us an appeal! Yes! You promised you wouldn't settle! You have succeeded in raping the voters of their city! ( cheering ) You people campaigned on this issue. I knocked on doors for you, Nick Longo. And you, Ed Fagan, you said, "I will go to jail." You're not even a man of your word. You know, we're gonna find out. We're gonna find out what deal was done and I think you're gonna regret the day you went into politics. So enjoy the next two years on the council! They're your last two years! Shame on you! You should be ashamed of yourselves! I'd like to remind the speakers to be respectful of the people up here. Woman :  Where's our respect? No more lies! No more lies! No more lies! ( crowd chanting ) No more lies! No more lies! No more lies! Yet officials say approval of eight East Yonkers housing sites by the council is inevitable despite the near unanimous objections of Yonkers residents,  hundreds of whom turned out tonight to register their displeasure. They're really gonna build them. Yeah, the paper said that the Loring and Clark site is still on the list. And that's just a couple of blocks from us. I mean, these people. They don't live the way we do. They don't want what we want. And their neighborhoods... Yeah, a mess. Buddy, that's the last damn meeting I'm going to miss. You mark my words. Majority rules in America, but it can't rule contrary to law! ( booing, shouting ) Mr. Clerk, roll call this vote. Mayor Wasicsko? Yes. ( booing ) Clerk :  Vice Mayor Spallone. No. ( cheering ) Majority Leader Cola? Cola :  Yes. Minority Leader Longo? Yes. Council Member Fagan? Yes. Mr. Chema? Mr. Chema? ( cheering ) Mr. Oxman? Yes. Clerk :  I have five ayes, two nays. The measure passes! ( booing ) Hey, please. What a waste of time. ( crowd chanting ) Sold us out! Sold us out! Sold us out! Sold us out! Sold us out! Sold us out! I never thought it could get this bad. Did you hear those people? Jesus Christ. What if we appeal to the Supreme Court? What if we say we're gonna appeal? There are no grounds, Nick. The lawyers said so. f*ck the lawyers. f*ck the lawyers? Yeah. You got a law degree, right, Nick? Yeah, I got too much pride to use it. Seriously, f*ck the f*cking lawyers. ( laughs ) Seriously, I don't see how you guys can sit here going over it again and again and again. I just want to go home. All right, I'm right behind you. I need to decompress, okay? I'm wired and exhausted all at once. I get it. I'll see you later. Be safe, okay? Yeah. 
 
 ♪ oh, I wanna dance with somebody... ♪ What's wrong with you? f*ck the lawyers? Never. The lawyers only f*ck you. Yesterday they sent us a bill for another $160,000 for last month, which means we've already spent, what, $15 million fighting this thing? Yeah, well, what's another couple hundred thousand? Come on, Nick. When we accepted the consent decree, we gave up our right to appeal. You go to the Supreme Court now, you piss off Judge Sand all over again. All right, so we don't appeal the low-income housing part of the plan. That's done, fine. But we can still appeal the affordable housing part, can't we? Right? That's the next 800 units that we're gonna have to build after these sites. What? Would you rather take your chances with Judge Sand or the good and angry people of Yonkers, New York? Whoa, wait a minute. Are you sh1tting me? Maalox and Stoli? Yeah. I've never seen anyone do that. Me neither, actually. ♪ I want to feel the heat with somebody ♪ 
♪ yeah, I wanna dance with somebody... ♪ Well? I don't recommend it. ( laughs ) ( coughs ) Where does this go? ( coughs ) That's extra. Extra? Yeah, you know they always give you extra pieces. No, they don't always. For real, Skip, we gotta do this right or the baby gonna be falling through the slats or some sh1t. Oh, my God. ( laughs ) This is serious. It ain't funny. We got to assemble this right or it's dangerous. All right, just chill out. You want me to call my father? He know how to do sh1t right. No, you ain't gotta call nobody. What, you don't think I know how to be a daddy? Yo, as soon as this boy come out, I'm going back to school. School? You? Yeah, me. Westchester CC. In the spring. I mean, I want to quit now, but... I need the cash so I can step back and do it right. What you gonna study? Something to get me hired. I don't know, maybe computers or some sh1t. I don't know. You know, definitely not construction. ( laughs ) This sh1t ain't me, man. It's not you, babe. It's not me. But it's okay. Carmen :  Felipe missed you. That he and his father have this time together is a good thing. I got the banana. ( laughs ) Good boy. Well, he home now. And you, too. It's better for them here, Javier, but I am killing myself. I'm working at the school 12 hours a day and I still can't keep up. Rent, electricity-- it's cheaper than New York, but not that cheap. And food. Food alone costs almost as much as I make here in a week. But Felipe's happy, no? All your kids. Plus, your place in New York is bad. So it's settled. What is settled? You raise my son here. You didn't hear what I said? I heard what you said. I can't believe you're saying it. Which part? The part about the money? 'Cause I don't see you working 12 hours a day to put food in his mouth and a roof over his head. That my fault, huh? That my fault? Always my fault. Huh? You gonna leave your kids here with a maid, huh? And you go back to America. That's my fault? The maid knows them a lot better than you do. Anyway, my mother is just down the street. ( speaking Spanish ) You're a bad mother. You're gonna leave your sons here and you're gonna run away. You're not a father. Do you want Felipe living with you? No. Then you have no say here. Felipe! ( chanting ) Sand is dirt! Sand is dirt! Go ahead. Thank you. Excuse me. That's their lawyer. That's f*cking Sussman! Excuse me, please. Hey, f*ck you, you son of a bitch! ( booing ) Thank you! Thank you! Uh, Michael Sussman, lead council for the NAACP. Not this door. What do you mean, not this door? They just-- they just told me to come in the side door. I could get in. That's what they just told me. You were told wrong. Look, Officer, I got to get in there, okay? I got to be in court tomorrow-- depending on what they do tonight be ready to argue that the council be held in contempt. I got to get-- What can I tell you? You're really doing an exemplary job, Officer. Really preserving the peace. Thank you. ( indistinct shouting ) Okay, I guess I'll just have to use the front door. Officer of the court coming through. Excuse me. Right. I'm not playing this game, okay? I'm not playing this game. Excuse me, sir. Please keep your hands-- thank you. Officer of the court coming through. Excuse me. ( crowd shouting ) ( exhales ) Look, I know it sounds bad out there. I know what's in your ears. But the vote tonight was specifically requested by Judge Sand. Now, he's not yet asking that we name more sites or even have a full plan for affordable housing. What he is asking is that the council affirm that we're still committed to the affordable housing part of the settlement. And we have to be committed. We agreed to it. Understood? Good. ( chanting ) Appeal! Appeal! Appeal! Yeah, you bunch of bums! ( chanting, yelling continues ) Oh, you! It's all right. ( gavel pounds ) ( chanting continues ) The Yonkers City Council is now in session. Mr. Clerk? ( Nick pounds gavel ) Please take your seats. Excuse me, may I? Thank you. Nick :  Will you please take your seats? This is my first meeting. ( pounds ) What do you do with this? Any idea? Here's your Pampers, baby mayor! ( cheering ) Man :  Yeah, I'm talking about you! Hey! Man #2 :  Try this on for size! DeLuca :  Remove him! What are you waiting for? Mr. Mayor, I think this was meant for you. ( cheering ) Thank you, Hank. ( laughing ) We've had it with what you're doing here! The hell with you! Officers, officers, could you please take care of this? Don't you build those projects! That's enough of you! ( gavel pounding ) Nick :  Officers. ( shouting continues ) Hey, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. You wanna carry me? Leave her alone! Don't you dare, Bobby. Don't you dare. I know your mother. ( shouting, booing ) Don't you dare! ( overlapping arguing ) ( pounding ) ( crowd chanting ) Don't you dare! Don't you dare! Don't you dare! Don't you dare! ( pounds gavel ) As indicated by our last vote, we elected to appeal the affordable housing portion of the judge's order to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court has refused to-- Appeal all of it, you coward! ( shouting, booing ) Roll call, Mr. Clerk. Roll call. Mayor Wasicsko? Aye. ( booing ) Vice Mayor Spallone? No. ( cheering ) Majority Leader Cola? No. Minority Leader Longo? No. Council Member Fagan? No. Council Member Chema? No. Council Member Oxman? Abstain. ( scattered laughter ) Man :  Pussy. Clerk :  I have one aye, five nays, one abstention. The measure fails! ( cheering ) Meeting adjourned. ( pounds gavel ) ( sizzling ) ( men yelling in Spanish ) Felipe :  I wanna play. When's it my turn? You're six. You don't know how to do anything. Next game. You always say, "Next game." Guys... I have something to tell you. This isn't gonna be easy for any of us, but I have to go back to New York soon. What? No fair. No, you can't. Felipe. This is best. For you to be here while I earn what I can there. Okay? Do you understand? Reporter on TV :  About 50 protesters from the Save Yonkers Federation greeted New York's Cardinal John O'Connor this afternoon when he rived at the gate of Saint Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie. The group objects to the New York Archdiocese's agreement to give some of the seminary's land to the City of Yonkers for public housing. Woman on TV :  We're urging Catholics all over the city, especially the parishioners of St. John the Baptist,  to withhold their donations from the church and from the cardinal's appeal. He needs to remember who the people are who are in his archdiocese. ( chatter ) ( phone rings ) Prenatal clinic. Is there a Doreen Henderson here? Me. Nurse :  Miss Henderson, I have a call for you. For me? Here? Mm. Hello? Man :  Ahem. Gammy found him in the apartment in Mulford. My boy always had trouble with that. Always. I never knew Skip to breathe without a struggle. What are we going to do? ( sobbing ) Clerk will call the roll... on the resolution approving the plan for 800 units of affordable housing to be built on the specified sites. Ahem. On the resolution approving the plan for 800 units to be built on the specified sites. What are you doing? I'm practicing. I'm trying to do it as dispassionately as I can. ( laughs ) Just even voice and... no show of emotion. I just want 'em to see that it's not getting to me, you know? Yeah? How's it going? I think I'm getting better at it. Yeah? I think so. Good. Yeah. Keep practicing. Clerk will call the roll. Ahem. Yeah. Clerk will call the roll. Clerk will call... the roll. Clerk will roll the call. ( clucking ) Ma'am Thank you. ( speaking Spanish ) Are you okay, ma'am? ( speaking Spanish ) My children. I miss them already. I'm so sorry, ma'am. ( engine starts ) Your nephew can't come anymore? I'm going to miss you. I know, darling. Your eyes can't get any better? No, Mr. Hobart, they can't. Norma, how old are you? I'm 47. You're still young. ( chuckles ) Am I? Sussman : Misled? Misled? Look at this. "Too many people of any category together can lead to a ghetto situation"? Are you kidding me? Your Honor, I know we're well past your deadline for approving the affordable housing component, but the cardinal's turnaround has the council marching backwards. They're asking for a new vote on the consent decree. They're saying that your decision is antireligion. Or anti-Catholic. Another Hebrew plot exposed! Yonkers officials are obviously using the cardinal's unfortunate retreat as a transparent ploy to get out of the entire consent decree. And please tell your mayor I said so. And where is Mr. Wasicsko today? He's meeting with our trial attorneys. Apparently, Cardinal O'Connor isn't the only one with cold feet. ( laughs ) Jesus Christ. Of course my firm has to resign from the case. I mean, what choice do we have? Our integrity's been attacked. The entire law firm has been attacked. I've been accused of misleading the cardinal, for God's sake. Cigar? ( sighs ) Cardinal O'Connor is actually saying we bamboozled him, as if we tricked him into offering land. Yeah, it's a dirty business, huh? Nobody gets out clean, do they? Gentlemen, I asked for the council to affirm that Yonkers still supports continuing with the second phase of the court settlement-- the affordable housing plan-- and the latest council action signals the exact opposite. So we are back to the usual precipice. I'm setting next Monday as a deadline for a vote in favor of enactment of a full housing plan, including the affordable housing component. Should you not approve a plan by then, you and the City of Yonkers will be in contempt of court and fines will begin. In addition, anyone who fails to vote in favor of enactment will be personally fined $500 a day and imprisoned. They'll be released once a week to attend a council meeting and consider changing their vote. Gentlemen, our object is not to create martyrs or heroes. Our object is to get this housing built. ( engine turns off ) Big night tonight, Pop. Judge is gonna give us one more chance. Deuce hits the fan and we separate the men from the sh1t talkers. ( sighs, chuckles ) Well, I don't think I got the votes. The stuff they're gonna be saying tonight, the shouting, the things they're gonna call me... You know, I wish you woulda lived long enough to see me win my first primary for council seat. New on the job, everybody wanted to be my friend. It won't be like this forever, though, right? I'll see you. Okay. Ahem. ( chatter ) That's the son of a bitch working for Judge Sand. The guy with the beard. ( clamoring ) Oh. You piece of sh1t. That's right, you're a piece of sh1t. Man #2 :  Hiding behind the cops. He's a Jew, Newman. They all are. That's why this is happening. They're not all Jewish. Well, Sussman, the lawyer that brought the suit, he's Jewish. And Newman and Sand. Last weekend, when we went up to Pound Ridge where he has a house-- Wait a minute. You went-- you-- I'm sorry, but you went to Pound Ridge where Judge Sand lives to protest? Judge wasn't home, but I'm sure he got the message. You know, I don't think it's right to make this about religion. That's not the point. All I'm saying is look who's behind all this mess. ( chattering ) Good to see you. Well, it's gonna be a wild one. Don't you feel threatened? Nah. Goes with the job. Maybe with yours. ( chuckles ) Man :  All right, Hank! Go get 'em! ( crowd cheering ) Woman : Hey, Hank! You tell 'em! Man :  Show us the pictures! Let us see what's on them. ( crowd booing ) ( pounds ) Will council members please take their seats? ( gavel pounds ) Council members, take your seats, please. ( shouting indistinctly ) Mr. Spallone, would you please take your seat? All right, as a first order of business, the, uh-- the council members  would like to just take a few moments to honor the firefighters and the police officers of this city  who have shown extraordinary bravery this past year. ( crowd booing ) ( pounds ) These men risk their lives. ( booing continues ) You go home to your mother, Wasicsko! Go home to your mother! Your father would be ashamed of you. Officers, please eject this woman. You hear me? You're a sleaze! You're a sleaze, Wasicsko! Officer :  Come on. Let's go. Here we go. Shame on you, Mr. Mayor. I invite everyone to come with me to the housing projects. Man :  Yeah. You can see here what public housing always leads to. Not just here in Yonkers, but everywhere else. Now, these are places that have become crack jungles  which have trapped innocent people in the name of helping minorities. As many of you know, I have been opposed to this plan... Man :  Cola, you sellout! ...but I am voting for it because... ( crowd booing ) ( pounds ) I am voting for it because maintaining our bond rating is too important. This is a direct attack by the judge on the quality of life here in Yonkers. ( cheering ) This is-- it's a typical case of the hypocrisy of the rich and the elitists looking down on those who have to work for everything they have. It is not up to this council to judge on the constitutionality of a court order. ( booing, shouting ) We've all sworn an obligation to uphold and obey the law. This is not about race. This is not solely a black and white question. This is a green issue. This is a question of economics. Roll call vote, Mr. Clerk, on the intent to adopt the housing plan as proposed. Man :  I got your intent right here! Mayor Wasicsko. Aye. ( booing ) Vice Mayor Spallone? No. ( cheering ) Majority Leader Cola? Yes. ( booing ) Minority Leader Longo? No. ( cheering ) Council Member Fagan? No. Mr. Chema? No. Mr. Oxman? Yes. Clerk :  I have three ayes, four nays. The measure fails. Meeting adjourned. ( cheering ) There does have to come a moment of truth, a moment of reckoning, a moment when the City of Yonkers seeks not to become a national symbol of defiance of civil rights  and not to heap shame upon shame upon itself. No court has strained harder, with greater patience,  to defer to the state and local government. But it would be difficult to imagine a clearer challenge to the Constitution or to a government of law than that presented this morning. I therefore have no alternative A fine that will double every day hereafter. As for you, councilmen, I find your rationale to be a frivolous pretext. How much hypocrisy must accompany this litigation? I find Councilmen Longo, Fagan, Chema, and Spallone  to be personally and individually in contempt of this court  and impose upon each of you a penalty of $500 a day, beginning today. In addition, if the necessary legislation is not enacted on or before next Wednesday, August 10th, you will report to the federal marshal for imprisonment until such time as you have purged yourself of contempt by approving the housing plan. This court stands adjourned. ( pounds gavel ) All rise. ( door opens ) ( phone ringing ) Is anybody gonna get that? Lisa? Nay? Is anybody out here? ( ringing continues ) Mayor's office. Yes, my name is Mary Dorman. I would like to talk to the mayor, please. This is the mayor. Hello? This is Mayor Wasicsko. This is-- I didn't, uh-- I didn't expect for you to answer. I called-- I wanted to tell you that I, um-- I think it's wrong of you to support the housing. Yeah, well, the law is the law, and the judge ordered it and the court upheld it and the law's the law. Well, why can't you say that you think it's wrong? At least let the people know that. Because that's not what a leader is supposed to do. A leader is supposed to lead, and that's what I'm trying to do. You threw me out of the last council meeting. Which one were you? I have gray salt-and-pepper hair. I have-- wear glasses. I was standing right at the railing. Yeah, I remember you. I promise I'll never have you thrown out again. Okay? Okay. All right, good-bye now. Who was that? No one, really. ♪ it's late at night ♪
