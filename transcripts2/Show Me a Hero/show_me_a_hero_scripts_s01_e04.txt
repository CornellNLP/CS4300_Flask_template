You got everything to the east where no one ever misses an election there. 'Cause they give a sh1t, right? This year, they do for sure. You're not an easy man to catch up with, Councilman. I've been calling to talk with you for a few days. Yeah, well, you know how these campaigns go. We're always running somewhere. Speaking of which, we're late for some radio we have to do. Oh, come on, Councilman. Couple questions and I'm out of your hair. Yeah? What would be the point? The point? It's an election, you're running. I'm covering it. Yeah, for "The New York Times." See, if you were one of the Yonkers guys, I'd talk to you. You know why? No, why? Because that would mean that you lived in Yonkers, that you worked in Yonkers like me, like they do. All you guys telling us what you think we should do, you're all actually from someplace else. You know that judge, he lives in Westchester. And Sussman and them lawyers, they live where they do. You know, I'm guessing you got yourself a nice little place in Manhattan somewhere or Park Slope, huh? Am I right? ( chuckles ) But you see, we live here. And when I pick up a copy of "The New York Times" and I read what you are writing about me and about this kid mayor who's gone all wet and about the housing thing, I know that it's got nothing to do with what's going on here. And what's going on? People working for their homes, their neighborhoods. They want to keep what they have. And you really think that building a couple hundred units of public housing is gonna wreck those neighborhoods? Yeah, I do. And the voters do, too. Man :  Go get 'em, Hank.

Wasicsko, why don't you go f*ck your mother? Go on. Why do you even have to talk like that, huh? ( spits ) Crowd : Oh! - Come on, man, you can't do that. You son of a bitch.

( faint chatter ) ( knocking ) Yeah, come in. Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys? Jesus. Yeah, I shoot the messenger. Who are you? This is Jeffrey Conlon, our best poll man. Right, right, right. Nick Wasicsko. How's it going? Have a seat. That's right, you were a cop. Yeah, Westchester County until I decided I needed a bigger gun and I went to law school. You see how that turned out. All right, what's the bad news? Wait a second. When is this sample from? This week through Tuesday. Holy Jesus. Really? I'm sorry, I've just been riding around in forests of Spallone signs. I'm finding it hard to believe. Citywide, we've got 48% who support accepting Judge Sands' housing order. Only 39% want the city to still keep fighting it. Yeah, and 12% with no opinion. How the f*ck does 12% of Yonkers not have an opinion on the housing? I mean, where do they find these people? Under f*cking rocks? On the issue, you've won. Spallone's flogging a dead horse here. You know something? I ride around this city, I look at all the signs, I hear these people yelling, but you forget that there's like this whole silent majority out there. Especially when you got these other bastards sh1tting on you every day. Spallone's got to know about these numbers, right? I mean, this has got to take the wind right out of his sails. He and his people probably have some idea how far he's trailing, yeah. But I bet the money people don't. Of course, we could enlighten them. Like leak the poll? "Herald Statesman"? You know, I mean, I'm nothing but a bum. But I love you. And you told me-- Yo, I'm telling you I ain't good enough for you. You need to forget about me. ( TV playing ) ( sniffles ) I'm pregnant. I wasn't gonna tell you. But you don't have to worry. I'm gonna get rid of it. ( distant siren wailing ) ( door opens, slams ) ( music playing ) ♪ jump, jump, jump, jump ♪

You're gonna have to step the f*ck up and be a father. Stop all your bullshit and be a f*cking man for me. I'm not doing this on my own. Damn, girl. Okay. I hear you. Yeah, you damn well better. ( dog barking ) You've never come up here before. To my mother's apartment. What you mean? You ain't never come up here for me. ( tsks ) Your mom's home? Why don't you come find out? Republican?  ( knock on door ) Wait, what the hell are you talking about? Oh, that son of a bitch. All right, let me call you back. sh1t! Oh, you heard. f*cking Spallone. I'm all set to wipe the floor with that asshole in the primary and now he switches parties? Are you f*cking serious? I didn't see this one coming. When's he gonna announce? Later today. Listen, local GOP didn't see it coming either. They're ripshit over it. They don't want him. They already got Longo, Chema, Fagan. Now with Spallone switching to Republican,  they're afraid they're gonna be known as the party of defiance. Jim, we should have never leaked those poll numbers. That's what did this. Well, think of it this way. You just saved yourself $75,000 in the primary. What the f*ck are you talking about? I'm gonna need twice that and then some come November when all the Neanderthals crawl out of the woodwork for Spallone. Plus who knows how much of a fight Iannacone's gonna put in the primary now or how much money Ralph Arred's gonna put behind him just to derail me. Well, if politics were easy, everyone would be in politics. Bullshit. Nobody sensible would ever put themselves through this. ( sighs ) Oh, God. This question of individual right is being trampled on by an unfair judge. Judge Sands, this-- ( laughs ) this philosopher king. Now it's time we restored the people's government to Yonkers. And I promise you, I will continue to appeal against this off-the-wall judge's decision to the Supreme Court and I will unconditionally oppose construction of public housing. We've all seen what this mayor has done. It's time you recognized your failure as a leader. And if the good people of Yonkers vote for you again...  - Time. ...you will be a disaster upon this city. Time, Mr. Spallone. Mr. Wasicsko. ( stopwatch clicks, ticking ) Ahem. Uh, certainly. My opponent is a one-dimensional candidate. He can only talk about one issue, housing, and he doesn't even get that right most of the time. He keeps trying to dupe the people of Yonkers by telling them that the Supreme Court can change the situation, but the Supreme Court has already ruled on all issues of liability and remedy in this case. That is forever closed. Yet Mr. Spallone, in order to advance his own personal political career, is willing to bankrupt the entire city in the process. There is a silent majority out there that's ready to put this issue behind them because they know that there's more important issues in this election. But they are being intimidated by the mob which is the loud minority. Well, it's time for the good people of Yonkers to take back the ground lost by these-- this very narrow lunatic fringe element. ( scattered applause ) ( music playing ) I got endorsed by "The New York Times." I get endorsed by Moynihan, by Governor Cuomo. I got the teachers, I got the unions, and I kicked his ass in the debate. ( sighs ) What the f*ck does it take? Whatever happens, you know you did the right thing. And if you lose, it won't be to stop the housing. It'll be to punish you. You see that, why can't they? Well, they aren't in love with you. Why? ( laughs ) Why aren't they? I'm lovable. Yeah, to me. To everybody. I'm the most lovable politician in America. That says next to nothing. Oh, come on. Don't go there. There are plenty of lovable politicians. Reagan is a lovable politician. FDR, Tip O'Neill, Kennedy. Lovable, lovable, lovable. ( laughing ) Ed Koch. He's a fat, wrinkly f*ck and they love his lovable ass down the river. ( high-pitched ) Hey, how am I doing? ( snorts, laughing ) Really, what-- how am I not lovable? You are. You think I'm gonna share a bed with Ed Koch or Tip O'Neill? Or Kennedy? Kennedy I might. He's dead, Nay.

Anchorman :  If that call is correct, it looks as if Dinkins will replace Mayor Ed Koch, the man he defeated in the Democratic primary, when the mayor leaves office at the end of the year. Dinkins' apparent win means that voters today elected the first black mayor of New York. Anchorwoman : With nearly all of the districts reporting to you live, Dinkins is leading... ( chatter ) Okay. Thank you. Well, that's the ball game. What do you mean? East Side results are still out, West Side is almost all in and I'm down a couple thousand, so... Is he sure? Yeah. Yeah, he's sure. Sorry, Ma. Your son is now the youngest ex-mayor in America. Nicky, it's just a bump in the road. Yeah, Nick, who knows, maybe you'll take the mayor's seat back after two years. I need an honest job. I gotta find something for you outside the mayor's office. Out of civil service. Maybe Parking Authority. You, too, Mike. There's a YPA spot open on the board. Finally get you that cushy job I promised you. ( chuckles ) Man :  Here it is, Nick. ...in the race for mayor of Yonkers... Here we go.  ...Democratic incumbent Nicholas... Break out the parachutes, everybody, 'cause this plane's going down. Reporter #2 :  At this point, Spallone... The fact is that this was not an easy time for Yonkers, but I am honored to have served my city when it needed me and I have no regrets. ( applause ) Thank you. You know how you know you're doing the right thing in Yonkers? No, how? They make you pay for it. ( chuckles ) If there was a hero in any of this, it was Nick. Show me a hero and I will write you a tragedy. You come up with that one? I wish. Fitzgerald said that. Who, the guy from New Rochelle? The one who's running for state Senate? ...in any way I might be able to help to do so. And I will be at Mr. Spallone's disposal. Thank you for all your hard work. ( applause, cheering ) And furthermore, we have been right and we are still right. I believe the decisions of the Supreme Court will come down in our favor and we will have struck a blow against the housing. ( cheering ) But if the decision is not in our favor, then we will abide by the decision. But we will see this appeal... What did he say?  ...right through to the end. What did he mean "abide by"? ( cheering ) Now, I'm being told that this housing fight is over. Crowd :  No! Well, for as long as these decisions are before the Supreme Court, they are very real. ( cheering ) ( knocking ) Hey, Pete. Hey. Come on in. Have a seat. Nay :  Hi, Peter. Oh, no, no, no. I know you guys are busy. I really just wanted to drop off this set of the working drawings for the first phase of the housing. These are the approved bids. Figured you'd want a copy. I mean, after all you've done for this. After all this is forgotten, those are gonna be there. I know it's been a lonely fight. Appreciate it. Nay. See ya. ( door opens, closes ) Carmen, sit. Eat with me. How are things in the DR? What have you heard from your babies? Well, a neighbor's dog bit Maria and it got infected. Thank God somebody finally saw the bite and took her for antibiotics. Oh, and Roberto, he went to the hospital, too. He and his friends were fooling around with an old truck and thought they'd push it to get it started. ( chuckles ) Ran over his foot. Boys. As soon as I get the money for two plane tickets, they come home.  ( distant chatter ) This is no way to be family. Ask Paul for an advance. You ask him. Me? I'm just the wife. You're his best worker. Me he can divorce. ( both laugh )  ( knocks ) Neil :  Getting out quick, huh? Yeah, well, Martinelli let me in early. I can do the same for Mayor Spallone. What is this, f*cking Christmas? Ah. You shouldn't have. What I mean by that is you really f*cking shouldn't have. f*ck you, DeLuca. If it's not parked out front and candy-apple red, then you really shouldn't have. First copy of the charter amendment you worked up and we passed. Because of you, this place won't be half as f*cked up as it is now. Well, I was just trying to get rid of you as city manager. It's easier to eliminate your job in the charter than round up four votes to fire you. Yeah, four votes are pretty elusive around here, aren't they? Yeah. If that had been there for us, none of this sh1t with the housing would have happened. You had no patronage. But two years from now? Nick, even Angelo couldn't get the strong mayor amendment passed. It's been a lonely fight, I know. What? Pete Smith said the exact same thing. Lonely fight. Well, don't be a stranger, Mr. Mayor. ( door opens, closes ) Girl, where the hell have you been? I've been looking for your ass all night. A'ight. Your boy locked up. What? John is locked up. Something about a robbery charge and some girls in a car. What the f*ck are you talking about, Meeka? John is locked up in Rikers. That's what Mambo said. My God, I gotta go see him. You realize that's all day to get there and back, right? You can't just show up at Rikers. It's Rikers. You gotta figure out visiting hours and when you can see him. Meeka, shut the f*ck up! Man :  You shut the f*ck up! ( sighs ) Be stupid. ( couple arguing ) Nothing at all? I thought he was your friend. 
 
 ( chatter ) ( whistles ) Woman :  Kamasa, come here! Kamasa :  What's up, girl? Woman :  No, come here. I wanna talk to you about the deal... ( continues indistinctly ) ( door buzzes ) John : It starts raining. I tell them, "Yo, we can take the train." But they didn't want to. Then like that, these four girls drive by in a car. Stash gets them to stop. They said they might give us a ride. Do you know them girls? No, they was just girls, you know? So we get in their car. This boy up front with two girls, me and Stash in the back with the other two. And we was laughing and sh1t. So we swapped names and numbers. You gave them your name? Nah, not my real name. Just Hot. But I gave the real number. I ain't know Stash and the other boy, they didn't give their real numbers. But later, Stash's friend, he tries to rob one of them girls and they're like all screaming and sh1t. I'm like, "What the f*ck was going on here?" Then they take off and I got nothing to do but follow. I thought that was the end of it, but one of them went to the cops. I guess I'm the only one they could find 'cause I'm the only one that gave a real number. Now, sh1t, they got me on robbery two. Why you gave them your number? They're clearing the land for the housing and what are you doing? Spallone :  What can I do? Mary :  What do you mean? You tell them we're not gonna take it. Stop the Housing Authority from making a plan. Mr. Spallone. All right, all right. You think I should just lie down in front of a bulldozer? Come on, Mary. Well, how is this any different from when Nick Wasicsko was mayor? I'll tell you. That kid was all wet. He ran saying he would fight and then he didn't fight. And you're the same way now, Hank. Come on, you know where I stand.  ( gavel pounds ) But what can I do if the court won't hear it? Mr. Mayor, if you please. We'd like to start the meeting now. All right. If we start late, we end later. Hold your horses. Come on, now. You know me. You know me.  ( gavel bangs ) Come on. Yeah, give me the hammer. What's first? Call to order, then the pledge, then the proclamations. Oh, Christ, wake me when there's something that matters. Council meeting of the City of Yonkers is now in session. Please all rise for the Pledge of Allegiance. ( trumpets softly ) ( sighs ) ( distant train horn blowing ) ( water running ) ( swishing )  ( water stops ) Hmm. That's not good.

Jesus, 14 months out, he's already announcing. He's running scared already. At City Hall they're saying he did it early to scare off competition. Well, yeah, he heard that Martinelli was running again. There'll be a dozen or so others lining up before it's all over. But this sh1t? This makes Spallone look desperate. Desperate's no way to kick off a campaign. Jack on TV :  Spallone sold us out... Check it out. Jack O'Toole. He's finished. We believed in him, we backed him and his campaign last year, but he has been a complete disappointment. He said he'd never give up. He said he'd never give in to the judge. That's it. That's it. Spallone lost O'Toole. Stick a fork in him. He's done. That's his base right there. O'Toole scares me. Like, more than the others. Yeah, 'cause he's more dangerous. You will never hear Jack O'Toole utter a racist phrase 'cause guys like that, they learn how not to say the bad words. No more coon. No more nigger. Nothing out of his mouth that'll give it away, you know? It's all property values and life and liberty and people only living where they can afford and all that talk. But underneath it all, it's fear. Same as it ever was. I played into that fear, too. When I got in for mayor, I did. It chewed me up. Man. What I would do with a second chance at that brass ring. They're getting ready to knock School Four down. This beautiful old building. I mean, it's 104 years old. It's a sin to tear this down, Buddy. Yeah. Well, do you think there'll be any trouble when they start? They did some demolition over at the site by the raceway, but that was just a vacant garage. I mean, when people see this go down... Is Jack O'Toole planning anything? He says we should be at every site,  protest every single change. I'm late. I'll see you later. Bye. Take care, doll. All right. I think I'm gonna drive out there, okay? I think I feel like I need to see it for myself. Okay. Well, be safe. I'll see you later. I'll see you. ( imitating truck engine ) Oh, boy. ( car opens, closes ) ( engine starts ) ( chatter ) ( door buzzes ) ( chatter over PA ) Man, yo. Oh, my God. Your cheek. You cut? Ain't nothing. What we got here? This is John Billie Santos. ( clicks tongue ) ( baby cooing ) Look at that. ( clicks tongue, laughs ) I don't know. It's a hard thing giving someone else your name. Well, he has both our names. That's right. I'm on the wait list for Schlobohm for a place of our own. The housing lady say with the baby I go to the top of the list. Yeah? Just about. ( fussing ) Come here. ( talking quietly )  ( door opens ) Hey. Oh, hey, Anne. Hi. Hi. Okay, why are you smiling like cats? Um, I don't know. Maybe it's this John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. What? I'm a finalist. I haven't-- Shh! I think Moynihan must have nominated me. Shh! ( laughing ) ( gasps ) All right, while-- while only 28 years old, you demonstrated political courage by your leadership and your unrelenting support for the rights of minorities and the poor. Despite calls for your resignation and threats to your personal safety, you forged a path to equality of opportunity and access to public housing in all parts of Yonkers, the committee found. It comes with a $25,000 check if I win. ( laughing ) Jackie Onassis herself handed out the award last year. If I'm gonna meet Jackie Kennedy, I gotta go shopping. Okay, Mom. You deserve this so much. If I win this, I'm running for mayor again. Yeah. No question. No question. Look at this. Look.  ( people arguing ) Man :  Yellow. Man :  Got that yellow. How you doing this evening? I'm all right. You up again? Man :  Got them yellow tops. Yeah, but I'm a little short right now. I mean, I'll be good later in the week, but now... I think we can work something out. Man :  Yellow. Cool. I'll get right with you later this week, for sure. Nah, I mean work it out. You know, a little something something. Man :  Yellow tops here. I don't-- Come on, girl, you ain't want the rock? What's up? I'll get you money later this week. There ain't no later. Ain't no free. You and me just got to step around the corner. Man :  Yellow. Man #2 :  Jimmy D! Man #3 :  Yo. Man #2 :  Yo, get your ass over here. Man :  Yellow. Man #3 :  Come on, man, what you want now? Man :  Got that yellow. Man #4 :  What's up, man? ( tractor beeping ) No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. Jack! No rest till we've won. No rest till we've won. Jack O'Toole! No rest-- What are we doing here? They started building already. We're letting them know that this doesn't end. They're never gonna be welcome here. What are we trying to accomplish? ( crowd chanting ) No rights for the whites! Mary : What? Jack :  We'll remember in November. ( crowd chanting ) We'll remember in November. We'll remember in November. We'll remember in November. ( music playing ) Man :  All sewage is done at the plant. The whole kit and caboodle will be done by the time they truck down here. Newman : You'll have this done in one day? Oh, yeah. We'll weld them in place, hook up the utilities, and then we're good to go. How quickly can you set the rest? Oh, after this, we'll be setting two or three a day. We'll have the first 142 up by the end of the year. No problem. ♪ she'll let you in her house... ♪
