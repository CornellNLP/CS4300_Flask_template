 You still here? 
 .. Morning. 
 Blueberry and banana pancakes... Secret recipe. 
 A coffee would have done. 
 You can't just have coffee on Holi. 
 It's a festival, a time of joy, for friends, family... loved ones. 
 The only thing Holi is a time for is abject bloody chaos. 
 So we're not having breakfast? 
 No time. Sorry. 
 You can make time. 
 And why would I do that? 
 I just thought it would be nice to have some quality one-on-one time. 
 You and me. Us. 
 We spent the night together. What more do you want? 
 Don't you think it would be nice to actually... talk sometime? 
 Talk? What on earth would we talk about? 
 I dunno. Life, death. 
 I just don't get the rush. 
 The hospital's not gonna fall down without you. 
 Yes, it will, actually. 
 Because some of us have real jobs with real responsibilities. 
 Not again. 
 Aw! 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 Today is, of course, the Festival of Holi. 
 The day when the entire adult population of this state behave like children for 24 hours. 
 What to expect? Everything. 
 Fractures, burns, breaks, poisonings. 
 You won't have heard of bhang, Dr Walker. 
 You have a treat in store. 
 It's made from cannabis leaves. They mix it into drinks. 
 Then come to us to have their stomachs pumped. 
 Expect a lot of that. 
 There's always some bunch of idiots who fall off a float somewhere and they all arrive at the same time. 
 Any questions? 
 Yes. Who's that? 
 That is a good question. 
 No idea. I found him on my doorstep this morning. 
 Someone just abandoned him? 
 It does happen, Dr Walker, in India and in England. 
 I've notified the bovines in the police department but, given the festival, I doubt they'll be here any time soon. 
 Poor thing. 
 Thank you for offering. 
 But be careful. 
 A weakness for babies has set women's emancipation back at least 100 years. 
 There you go. 
 You're a natural, Dr Walker. 
 Check him over before the rush really starts. 
 A foundling is the least of our worries today, believe me. 
 Now, where's AJ? 
 Er... He must be held up in traffic. 
 I'm sure he'll be here soon. 
 Will you come visit me? 
 You know I would love nothing more. 
 But I cannot. 
 An Indian doctor has many responsibilities. 
 My patients rely on me. 
 But not even for a holiday? 
 Holidays are for amateurs. 
 My work is my life. 
 Do you think we'll ever see each other again? 
 My British butterfly... if it's meant to be, the gods will take care of it. 
 This has truly been the best week of my life. 
 Mine too! Definitely. 
 Come on, Josie. 
 Let's hope that the gods are listening. 
 Goodbye, my British butterfly. I will miss you! 
 I will never forget you! 
 Hey, not so fast. 
 OK, well, girls, I've got to go this way. 
 All the best. Take care. 
 Bye. 
 Er... excuse me. Excuse me, guys. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Hello? Can you hear me? Are you OK? 
 Did anybody see what happened? 
 Well? 
 Normal. 
 So, how are you feeling? 
 Never better, Dr Varma. 
 I think India agrees with me. 
 Well, I'm glad. 
 But your condition remains serious. 
 Ssh. Not today. It's Holi. 
 Yes, I am aware of that. 
 It can be quite... intense. 
 Especially for a first-timer. 
 Good. 
 My mind is waiting to be blown. 
 I may even try some of this concoction everyone's talking about. 
 Ah, bhang. 
 May as well go out with one, eh? 
 Excuse me. Hey... 
 I need some help here. 
 One moment, please. 
 Doctor! Doctor! 
 Hi. 
 Excuse me! 
 Please don't manhandle my staff. 
 I'm sorry. I just need someone to help me. 
 You look fine. Take a ticket and sit down. 
 You don't understand. I'm fine. It's my father. 
 I think there's something wrong. His name's Desmond Macintosh. 
 He's around 60. 
 Sunshine? 
 You're Sunshine? 
 I used to know his father really well. 
 Haven't seen him for years. 
 You OK to hold the fort here? 
 Of course. I'm used to holding the baby. 
 Confidence. That's what I like to see. 
 Never underestimate your own abilities. 
 One hour, no more. 
 Make sure I have a functioning hospital to return to, please. 
 I can't believe you remember me. 
 How can I forget the day I met Sunshine Macintosh? 
 I'd only been here a few weeks. 
 You were burning up with a fever, screaming blue murder. 
 Your mother was sobbing and your father was chanting some kind of Tibetan mantra into my right ear. 
 And these days people call me Sunny. 
 Oh. OK, Sunny, so what are you up to these days? 
 I run a data processing department in Reading. 
 Actually, there they call me Mr Macintosh. 
 And what does Desmond think about that? 
 I've no idea. I haven't seen him for ten years. 
 Found her collapsed in the street. Possible head injury. 
 Do we know her name? 
 Nobody was with her. 
 I don't recognise her. 
 Hello, can you hear me? What's your name? 
 OK, she's not responding. 
 Let's get a nasal airway in her, please. 
 Yes, I agree, looks like a probable head injury. 
 Probably slipped and fallen. 
 I don't think so. 
 She's bleeding. 
 You see, placenta fragments have been retained. 
 Which means the womb can't contract. 
 Which explains the bleeding and the shock. 
 Maybe we've found our missing mother. 
 Treatment? 
 Resuscitate, therapeutic D&C? 
 Good. You think you can handle that? 
 I'm not a gynaecologist. 
 I know that. 
 But you're here to learn, aren't you? 
 Yeah, but... 
 So learn. 
 OK. 
 Ready? 
 You start with the smallest dilator first. 
 Then you move on up. OK? 
 What are you waiting for? 
 A few days ago, I get this letter asking me to come out here. 
 No reason. Only that it's a matter of life and death. 
 So I fly halfway across the world and he won't let me in. 
 It doesn't make sense. 
 And you think he's unwell? 
 Or deaf. 
 Listen. 
 He's singing. 
 He's wailing. 
 Desmond? Desmond Macintosh. It's Lydia Fonseca. 
 Dad? Dad! Desmond! 
 See? 
 In situations like these, I think it's essential to try and think like one's opponent.

 Ohh-oh! 
 Come here. Come here. Come here. 
 You're home! 
 My boy... 
 My boy. 
 Aw... 
 You don't get this in Stourbridge, eh? 
 Whoa! 
 Come on. 
 Thank you. 
 We're ready to go. Come on. 
 Oh, look, come here. 
 Can I have two, please? 
 You don't even know what that is. 
 Oh, it's traditional. Something called bhang. Look. 
 Smells like disinfectant. What's in it? 
 Better not to smell, sir. 
 Just drink. 
 Come on! One... two... 
 If I go blind, I'll come looking for you. 
 .. three! 
 Ooh! 
 Oh. 
 Pay the man. 
 There you go, mate. 
 Thank you. That was strong. 
 You should put some clothes on. 
 Never! I always work naked. 
 Peels back the barriers to perception. 
 How long have you had that cough? 
 May 11th, 1981. 
 It started the day Bob Marley died. 
 You're severely congested, probably pneumonia. 
 Desmond, you should have called me. 
 Sorry. Quacks don't agree with me. 
 I can't believe you live like this. 
 Priorities, Sunshine, dear boy! 
 Art comes first. Life later. 
 What the hell was that? 
 Rat! God, there's a rat! 
 That's not a rat. It's Jimi Hendrix! 
 Hey, I'm Dr Walker. 
 What's your name? 
 Shobha. 
 Where am I? 
 You're in the hospital. 
 You collapsed. 
 You had to have a procedure. 
 But it's OK. Really. 
 You're going to be fine. 
 Where's your baby? 
 What baby? 
 We know you gave birth recently. 
 It's why you collapsed. 
 Your body hadn't discharged the placenta. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have a baby. 
 I'm not going to a bloody hospital! 
 You need an X-ray. 
 Probably intravenous antibiotics. 
 Plus this place is disgusting it's a health hazard. 
 Sunny's right. You can't stay here. 
 I'm going nowhere. This is exactly what happens when doctors get involved! 
 Why the hell did you bring her here anyway? 
 The same reason I jumped on a bloody plane. 
 The letter you sent... I was worried about you. 
 God alone knows why. 
 I don't know what's wrong with him. He's changed. 
 Should've seen him as a baby. 
 So calm. Like a little Buddha. 
 He's simply concerned about you. 
 That chest needs treatment or it'll get worse. 
 So treat me here, if you're so worried about it. 
 Hospitals are for sick people. 
 I would, but Jimi doesn't sound too well either. 
 Jimi? 
 That cough could be pneumonia. 
 Which is pretty serious in simians. 
 Can kill them..... like that. 
 Or monkey pox. 
 Or worse. 
 Of course, if we got him to hospital, we could confirm that diagnosis and maybe save his life. 
 But you probably don't like that idea. 
 Shobha is clearly the mother of the baby but refuses to admit anything. 
 Do you blame her? Abandoning a baby is a criminal offence. 
 No, it's not that. She's terrified. 
 She needs help. 
 She should have asked for it before she put her child at risk. 
 You need to inform the authorities. 
 Everything is black and white with you. 
 She knows she's in trouble. 
 I'm glad she understands how serious this is. 
 She's virtually a child herself. 
 She needs help, someone she can trust. 
 If you can't see that, you're blind as well as arrogant. 
 Oh. 
 Dr Walker! Dr Varma! Here... Now! 
 And what can I do for you? 
 Argh! 
 So the powder must have worsened your asthma. OK? 
 No more today. OK? 
 No! No! 
 No! 
 Come, come. Breathe, breathe. 
 Come with me. Come, come, come. 
 It's not funny. 
 Of course not. 
 Mari. 
 As predicted, abject bloody chaos. 
 Excuse me. 
 Highly congested. 
 It's Holi, Jimi. 
 My favourite festival of the year... 
 .. and I forgot. 
 You've been sick. 
 You don't understand, Sunshine. 
 It's like Santa Claus forgetting Christmas. 
 I didn't remember. 
 I've never missed Holi in 20 years. 
 Excuse me, this way, please. 
 We've found the mother. Well, at least I think we have. 
 I just wanted somewhere quiet for the baby till... 
 And the police, they've been informed? 
 I wanted to talk about that. In the circumstances... 
 Abandoning a baby is a crime, Dr Walker. 
 Whatever the situation, the authorities must be informed. 
 I don't think we should rush. 
 And in England, a girl like this would be a personal crusade, would she? 
 Or would you be required to inform social services whatever the circumstances? 
 I thought so. 
 I need to change. 
 Fine. I'll call them. 
 Haven't you forgotten something? 
 
 
 
 AJ! AJ! 
 I think someone's looking for you. 
 AJ? 
 Josie? 
 Wow. Was your flight delayed? 
 So you'll get the next flight out? 
 I'm staying, my handsome gorgeous doctor! 
 She has to go home! 
 Doesn't look like she's going anywhere, mate. 
 What the hell did you say to her? 
 Nothing! I simply told her what I tell all of them. 
 Which is? 
 That, you know, if it's meant to be, the gods will take care of it. 
 The gods usually make sure they get back on the plane. 
 This is such a disaster. 
 Thanks. 
 OK. So let's go snorkelling at the weekend. 
 Or get a boat to one of the islands and have a picnic! 
 That would be romantic, wouldn't it? 
 You and me... dolphins! 
 Yeah. 
 Obviously I'm dying to see your penthouse first. 
 Er... no. 
 I have to go. 
 Oh, now? 
 It's the hospital. They just texted. 
 I mean, I have it on vibrate. 
 There's an emergency. So... 
 When will you be back? 
 As soon as I can. Promise! 
 See you later, Dr Nair! 
 Yeah, later, doc. 
 There you are! 
 In your absence, I've been holding the fort almost.... 
 Oh... 
 Are we a veterinary practice now? 
 I thought you hated monkeys. 
 I do. 
 But out of the two, the monkey is the easiest to deal with. 
 Lobar pneumonia. 
 Looks nasty. 
 Someone from the festival? 
 No. Desmond Macintosh. 
 Oh, the artist? 
 Is he still alive? 
 Just. 
 Although he's trying his best to change that. 
 He's here, but he wants to go home. 
 Home? With a chest like that? 
 Is he mad? 
 Very possibly. 
 Hi. 
 Do you wanna hold him? 
 It's easy. 
 Let me help you. 
 Come on. 
 Shobha! 
 Shobha? Shobha, come back! 
 Shobha? Excuse me. Shobha? 
 Shobha, you need to come back to the hospital. 
 I'm not going there. 
 You're going to call the police. 
 No, we're not. I promise. 
 I saw the way you looked at me. 
 You think I'm a terrible person... 
 You're my patient. 
 All I care about is getting you well. 
 Nobody's talking to the police. 
 You have my word. 
 Where's Dr Walker's patient? This is her bed. 
 She's post op, the uterine bleed. 
 OK, if you can't find her, call the police and make sure they understand the situation. 
 She's probably scared and vulnerable. 
 And find Dr Walker! 
 OK, sorry to keep you. 
 Right, as suspected, both you and Jimi Hendrix have severe pneumonia. 
 You'll need to stay a while for monitoring. 
 This is ridiculous! 
 Dr Fonseca only wants to help you. 
 You won't be here for long. 
 Right? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 It's just a temporary measure. We have your antibiotics. 
 Red for you. Yellow for Jimi. 
 Don't mix them up, OK? 
 I'm not an idiot! 
 Exactly how long do I have to stay in this hell hole? 
 I'll review you in a while. 
 If you behave yourself, we'll talk. 
 Oh, maybe you can settle something for me. 
 Dr Nair and I were just arguing. 
 The Rolling Stones -- who was in the original line-up? 
 Jagger, Richards, Wyman, Watts. 
 And poor old Brian, of course. 
 Not Taylor? 
 Joined in '69. 
 First played on Let It Bleed. 
 Damn. I lose. 
 Now remind me about those pills. Which ones are yours? 
 What pills? 
 Have you finished with that? 
 You think I should go to the hospital? 
 You know, surprise him? 
 Or is that a bit stupid? 
 Stupid? Are you crazy? 
 Dr Nair loves surprises more than my mum loves cake. 
 Really? 
 Go. 
 Go surprise him. 
 What are you waiting for? 
 Dementia? 
 You're displaying all the signs -- short-term memory loss, erratic behaviour. 
 Then there's the weight loss. When did you last eat? 
 I eat when I'm hungry. 
 I don't think you remember to eat at all. 
 This is ridiculous! 
 If you poke and prod around, of course you're gonna find some trouble in a man of my age. 
 I'm just a little under the weather, that's all. 
 What about Sunny, then? Why is he here? 
 Dunno. Ask him. 
 You wrote to me. 
 You asked me to come and see you. 
 Nonsense. 
 Then what's this? 
 You said you wouldn't call them. 
 Shobha Pereira... 
 I gave her my word. 
 You should have started correct procedures. 
 I told you to remain objective. 
 That's not fair. I was trying to make sure -- 
 If fairness came into it, there'd be a cure for cellulite. 
 I said to call the authorities. 
 But clearly Dr Walker preferred to take matters into her own hands. 
 The fact remains we had a vulnerable patient on our hands and we should all have been watching her. 
 So are you gonna sort this mess out or will it, as usual, fall to me? 
 I'll call the parents. 
 Hi, there. 
 I'm here to see Dr Nair. 
 He's busy. You'll have to wait your turn. 
 Oh, buggeration. 
 Surprise, Dr Nair. 
 Ah! 
 So, how long... before I go completely gaga? 
 Impossible to say. 
 I'm curious. Why did you write to him? 
 I just wanted to spend some time with my boy. 
 But why now, after all these years? 
 I don't know. 
 He owes me nothing. 
 He's still your son. 
 Is he? 
 Now I look him in the eye, I'm not so sure. 
 Talk to Sunny. Tell him how you feel. 
 Whilst I still remember his name? 
 Which is Sunshine, by the way. 
 Always was. 
 Just... Sunshine. 
 Shobha's made a good recovery. And the baby's great, healthy. 
 I cannot believe it. 
 How could she have hidden this from us for so long? 
 Everything is going to be all right. 
 I never knew you could dance like this. 
 Me neither. 
 Whoa. 
 I feel a bit stoned. 
 Stoned? No! 
 I smoked a bit of weed back in the day. 
 I remember. 
 Paul Smart, you bad boy! 
 Come on! 
 Hey. Are you all right? 
 Is it too much? Should we go? 
 No. 
 It's amazing. 
 I'm having the most amazing time. 
 What is it, then? 
 I don't want it to end. 
 I don't want to die, Paul. 
 I don't want to die. 
 The police understand that Shobha panicked and made a mistake. She's just a child. 
 She can't be held responsible for her actions. 
 They can put the formal adoption procedures in place now. 
 And you're sure that's what Shobha wants? 
 It is what is right. 
 My daughter is an excellent student. 
 She has a bright future ahead. 
 Must put all this unpleasantness behind. 
 I want to thank you again for everything you have done. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 I'm sorry. You OK? 
 Yeah. Just missed me. 
 My fault. Let me get you another. 
 Erm... two teas, please. 
 Two teas? 
 Yeah. 
 How's your dad? 
 Erm... it turns out he's losing his mind. 
 Although quite how anyone can tell is a mystery to me. 
 Thanks. 
 It's almost funny. 
 I'd finally managed to forget him and now this. 
 What would you do? 
 A man I hardly know expects me to drop everything to take care of him. 
 I never knew my dad. 
 Maybe you have a second chance? 
 Thanks for the tea. 
 Well? 
 I suppose I can take time off work. 
 At least until we figure things out. 
 I need to make some calls, tell work I'll be away a while. 
 Thank you. You're a good son. 
 For what it's worth, I agree. 
 I need a couple of hours, and then I'll be back to collect him. 
 Can we make sure he's ready? 
 Yeah, yeah, of course. 
 Thanks. 
 I've never been so embarrassed in all my life! 
 Clearly I've failed as a father. 
 I've not imposed enough discipline, allowed you too much freedom. 
 If your mother were here... 
 Well, things are going to have to change. 
 Beginning now. 
 I want to apologise for my son's poor behaviour towards you. 
 He was not raised to be so disrespectful to women. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. 
 Where is he now? 
 With the police. 
 They've come to collect him. 
 Do you think I can see him, say goodbye? 
 I'm sorry, it's against the rules. 
 But they'll take good care of him. 
 So did I. 
 I'd have never left him on a doorstep. 
 What do you mean? 
 My mother. My father. 
 They took him away in the middle of the night. 
 They didn't even tell me. 
 So you don't want this? 
 If I try to keep him, my parents will disown me. 
 What kind of life would he have then? 
 I can't take care of him on my own. I don't have any money. 
 My parents are right. 
 This is the only way. 
 I'm er... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should have... listened to you. 
 Imagine how she must have felt, waking up like that to find him gone. 
 And then they tell her what they've done. 
 One minute he's there and... and the next he's gone. 
 Disappeared out of her life forever. 
 Erm... I need a drink. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 I-I don't want a drink. 
 I know... I know it's supposed to be the default setting for the English doctor but I... I really, really don't want to just forget this. 
 Not today. 
 We're not going to the bar. 
 What do I do? 
 That's up to you. 
 How often do you come to your temple? 
 Only when I need to. 
 Or someone else does. 
 You were right. I shouldn't have let it get to me. 
 It's easier said than done. 
 Plus I've had more practice. 
 I was pregnant. 
 Three years ago. 
 It wasn't planned. I had exams. 
 And I'd worked so hard to get there. 
 So I just kept on working, kept on pushing, pretending nothing was happening. 
 Marcus was painting the spare room and I... 
 I was wishing it would all just go away. 
 And then it did. 
 He did. 
 They told me it was a boy. 
 I think they thought it would help, you know, with the process. 
 And everyone kept saying, "Oh, don't worry. 
 You can try again." 
 But I knew I couldn't. 
 I didn't deserve it. 
 Because I'd had a baby... 
 .. and I'd just wished it away. 
 I wished him away. 
 Sunshine's not coming back, is he? 
 Sorry, Desmond. I don't think he is. 
 Then I want to go home. 
 I'm not sure that's a good idea. 
 Please. 
 Just take me home. 
 There should be enough there to last the week. 
 Here's my number. 
 You can call me any time, day or night, OK? 
 And those are for Jimi. 
 Guess you pays your money and you takes your choice, eh? 
 Please tell me you've still got alcohol. 
 Sorry, after hours. 
 It'd be illegal for me to sell it to you. 
 So... to what do I owe the honour of this late-night visit? 
 You said you wanted to talk, didn't you? 
 So let's talk. 
 Just make it interesting.
