 Vikram! 
 That's it? 
 Big full moon parties going on all down the coast. 
 Demand is up, so the supply is down. 
 You know I've always been your best customer, Vikram. 
 That's what they all say. Do you want this or not? 
 Yes. Yes, I want it all. 
 Just give me a minute, will you? 
 He's alive. He's breathing! Come on! 
 Get him out of the water! 
 Come on. Can you help me here, buddy? 
 That's good. 
 Treat her like a lover and she won't want to fight you. 
 I thought you said you could drive. 
 I can. Cars! 
 Sensible little cars with pedals and automatic climate controls. 
 More throttle. And this time, ease the clutch out gently. 
 Er... or you could always ride pillion. 
 A lot of girls prefer it, huh? 
 Right. 
 Clutch... and down. 
 3,000 revs. 
 Clutch... 
 Male, early 30s, found face down in the sand. 
 Lungs are clear -- no sign of any pulmonary oedema. He's lucky. 
 Does he have a name? 
 Nothing was on the beach. 
 No bag or wallet. 
 Probably a tourist. 
 Early morning swim gone wrong. 
 People underestimate the currents. 
 Most of them are never seen again. 
 A ray of sunshine as ever, Dr Varma. 
 Gorgeous and lucky. An ideal combination. 
 Can we say that about a patient? 
 A medical observation, Dr Walker, nothing more. 
 From the definition of his rectus abdominis, it's obvious he takes care of himself. 
 I think these days they call it a six pack. 
 His identity will have to wait till he comes round, or someone arrives to claim him. 
 It can't be every day you misplace an Adonis. 
 Even on a full moon. It's not just about the party. 
 I don't get how that's... 
 Well, strange things happen. 
 You know, things even I can't explain -- seriously. 
 Oh, do stop it! 
 Dr Walker isn't a beach shack seduction -- she's here to work! 
 She's not interested in ridiculous superstition. 
 This way, Dr Walker. 
 If you can tear your eyes away from his abdominals, I have a job for you. 
 Dr Varma. 
 I'm assuming you've done a school check before? 
 Actually, no. 
 In England, the GP did it, but I did community work. 
 Small children are equally disgusting the world over. 
 Dr Varma here will help with any communication issues. 
 I'm quite capable of doing this myself. It will be easier. 
 But not as educational for Dr Walker. 
 How are the language lessons going? 
 Namaskaram! Ente peru Ruby ennannu. 
 Not bad, but the accent is truly appalling. 
 Still, I suppose Mumbai wasn't built in a day. 
 If Dr Varma would rather go alone, I really don't mind. 
 Whether this is nascent sexual tension or genuine dislike, in this hospital we must all find a way to work together, whether we like it or not. 
 Make sure to check the boys' testicles. 
 As I recall, two is the magic number. 
 Is a blessing really necessary? 
 On these roads, you need all the help you can get. 
 Should we have a lighter that close to the petrol tank? 
 Ready? 
 OK, consider yourself blessed. 
 I've asked both Ganesh and Vishnu to protect you. 
 If you insist on driving in India, two gods are better than one. 
 Be safe! 
 I don't see why we need to involve him. 
 We have an unidentified person on the ward. 
 And involving the police will simply complicate the matter. 
 Inspector Gomez... 
 .. is a hare-brained ignoramus whose only saving grace is that he's eating himself into an early grave. 
 Who, despite all that, is in a position of authority. 
 Our mystery man will come round soon enough. 
 And what if he doesn't? 
 Sorry. 
 Dr Fonseca. I thought you'd want to know. He's awake. 
 How many now? 
 Three. 
 Your brain appears to function, at least at a basic level. 
 Now all we need is a name. 
 Sorry? 
 They found you on the beach. 
 No identification. So we have no idea who you are. 
 Just go around it! Or run him over, I don't care. 
 It's only a python. 
 It's harmless. 
 They can swallow a small dog but even pythons draw the line at English doctors. 
 Funny! 
 Or you can turn around and go back home. 
 Keep on going till you get back to England. 
 Do you know you're very rude? Disrespectful, in fact. 
 But it's not gonna work. 
 Are you on holiday? Travelling? 
 I'm trying. I... just don't know. 
 The accent, can you place it? 
 Unhelpfully international. 
 What's wrong with me? 
 Physically, zero. 
 Vous etes francais, peut-etre? 
 Wie heisst du? 
 So you're really telling us you don't remember anything, that you have no memory of your life before now? 
 Nothing. Nothing at all. 
 So... your call. 
 Heads for pricks, tails for balls. 
 Tails? 
 Tails it is. 
 So I'll do the vaccinations. 
 And the balls are all yours. 
 Dr Varma usually comes by himself. 
 He must be glad of the help. 
 You'd think so, wouldn't you? 
 I've always found him most professional. 
 Perhaps he's worried that the children will like you more. 
 Maybe we should get down to business. 
 First I'll need to examine the boys, make sure they're all... developing correctly. 
 Of course. 
 Er... 
 I was thinking maybe one at a time? 
 That's a lot of tiny balls for one morning. 
 They're cute -- the boys, not the balls. 
 Are they always this well behaved? 
 Without fail. 
 Because they hold their esteemed teacher in such high regard. 
 Or the fact I promised them they could all skip mathematics if they kept quiet. 
 That's bribery, surely? 
 This is India, Dr Walker. 
 A bit of baksheesh now and then makes our lives a little easier. 
 I'm surprised this is your first visit here. 
 Don't you have relatives, family? 
 Possibly. Probably? 
 My mother's English but my father was born in Mumbai. 
 They met back home but he left when I was a baby. 
 So you've never even met him? 
 And you believe he returned to India? 
 I don't think anyone knows. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey! 
 Nothing? 
 Profound and total memory loss. 
 I can see how that would make it difficult to identify him. 
 Yes, but what are you actually going to do, apart from standing here littering my office, masticating like a bovine? 
 Well, if there's no crime been committed... 
 First we must follow the approved procedure. 
 A formal missing persons report, then full state notification. 
 We should have a preliminary answer within a week or so. 
 A week! Ridiculous! 
 My patient doesn't have a week! I need an answer today. 
 Here's a thought -- why don't you go and find out who he is? 
 Ask questions, look for clues. You have six hours. 
 And give me that chocolate, you're too fat! 
 No wonder your blood pressure's sky high. 
 What are you waiting for? Go! 
 Hello? 
 How can I... Not again! 
 This b*st*rd just bit me. 
 Where this time? 
 Just now, behind the old bakery. 
 Where on your body? 
 Oh, on my leg. Here. 
 Must have sneaked up behind me. 
 The place is crawling! 
 It's the grain brings the rats, the rats bring the snakes. 
 And the snakes bring Juan Gonzalo, the snake catcher. 
 Only now, they're biting back! 
 May I see it, please? 
 Yeah. 
 The snake. 
 Here. 
 Russell's viper? 
 Correct. 
 I blame it on the full moon. 
 Always makes them more aggressive. 
 Russell's viper... 
 I'll fetch the antivenom. 
 Thank you. 
 Yet again, Juan. 
 Senor Gonzalo. 
 I'm Ram Nair. I'm the senior doctor here. 
 Along with Dr Fonseca. 
 Oh, I know the good doctor. 
 May we take a look at your leg, please? 
 Ah, yes. 
 Is there a problem? 
 Yes, I understand. I'm on my way. 
 Hey, where you going? 
 We've run out of antivenom again. 
 I need to fetch some from the Dhoni Clinic. 
 You need to get back on your own. Think you can handle that? 
 I'm sure I'll cope. About the... boy you were talking to... 
 You're being abandoned? 
 There was an emergency. 
 But I think we were pretty much finished here. 
 I was going to ask Dr Varma. 
 Could you take a look at someone for me before you leave? 
 A child I have some concerns about. 
 He's been falling behind in class, losing weight too. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Vijay! 
 You're Dr Varma's friend, aren't you? 
 Doctors are like rats. 
 One could be just passing through. 
 Two mean you've definitely got a problem. 
 I mean, usually you just jab me in the back and send me back to work. 
 There's no antivenom left. 
 The nearest supply is in the city. 
 We're doing our best to get you some as soon as possible. 
 Oh, I... I see. 
 Well, in that case... 
 .. I'd like you to call this number, please. 
 Please. 
 Well, his examination is normal, but I agree, he seems small for his age. 
 Any other symptoms? 
 He falls asleep in class sometimes. 
 Sometimes has abdominal pains. I think he's hungry. 
 What about his parents? Are they concerned too? 
 That's part of the problem. I understand the father is absent. 
 I tried Vijay's mother but she doesn't respond. 
 Does she live nearby? 
 The next village. 
 I think she has a stall at the local flea market. 
 I should take some blood tests. 
 Normally we check with parents, but in the circumstances... 
 Please... 
 Nanni. 
 What did he say? 
 That he is brave. 
 Also that your accent is funny. 
 Ah. 
 These are lovely, Paul. 
 Yes, I'll take them. They're only 200. 
 Nanni. Put them in that black bag there. 
 There's another stall I just want to have a quick look at. 
 Nice colour. OK. 
 Beautiful. 
 This is our highest quality garment. 
 Oh, it's really lovely. 
 But I've spent so much already today. 
 My husband will have my guts for garters. 
 But this is your perfect colour. 
 Surely your husband will see that immediately? 
 You're not wrong. 
 And they do say you only live once, eh? 
 Actually, Hindus believe we all live many lives. 
 Sir! Insect! 
 Insect in your ear! 
 Please! Huge one! 
 What? Where? Christ! 
 OK, sir. Gone now! 
 I take away. Please! 
 Please! Please! 
 Get out of here! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Little conman! Let me help you, sir. 
 No, don't worry. It's fine. I can do it. 
 Not more? 
 I'll give you a twirl. 
 I'll let you know as soon as we get the results. - Thank you. 
 It's the full moon tonight. 
 I know! 
 Weird things happen, right? 
 Magic in the air, the dead walk the earth. 
 Everyone round here goes to Greg's. 
 If you're free tonight... 
 Sounds fun but I was thinking of hitting the phrase book. 
 Lydia wants me fluent by the end of the month. 
 It's more original than the hair-washing excuse. 
 Clearly I meet a lot of women who have dirty hair. 
 No excuses, honestly. 
 Plus... 
 It's a long story. 
 The best kind. 
 I'm sort of getting over someone. 
 On my own. 
 I understand. 
 A broken heart needs time to mend. 
 And perhaps a little distance? 
 Thank you for helping Vijay. 
 Let me know what you find. 
 Of course. 
 I guess that might've been my fault. 
 I can give you a lift. 
 OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Move over, Vishnu. 
 What are you doing in my home? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Dr Walker. 
 Ruby Walker, from the hos... pital. 
 You did this? 
 It's simply a routine blood sample. 
 I know we should have asked your permission first. 
 Of course, it might just be simple failure to thrive. 
 You know how I feel about those vultures! 
 But I'm concerned the child is neglected. 
 I want to know who let him in! 
 Senor Gonzalo insisted. 
 Dr Fonseca! 
 Will you just wait? 
 I can only be furious about one thing at a time! 
 You, out! 
 Now! 
 Senor Gonzalo asked me to hear his last confession. 
 Did he now? Then, in that case, I'll save you both a job. 
 All this man's done for the last ten years is gamble, kill snakes and drink too much coconut feni on a Friday night. 
 He also cheats at gin rummy but thinks no-one notices. 
 That's a lie! I never cheat! 
 Get out of my hospital. 
 Say three Hail Marys and a... 
 Out! 
 Give me your hand. 
 Now you listen to me, Juan Gonzalo. 
 Dr Varma will get the antivenom here in time. 
 You will die only when I tell you that you can die and not a minute before, do you understand? 
 Good. 
 Increase the fluids. Another dose of steroids. 
 And no more priests! 
 Yes, Dr Fonseca. 
 Where is Dr Varma? 
 I'll call him now. 
 Nanni. 
 Hey! Hey, hey! 
 Hey! 
 Total amnesia. Remarkable. 
 I haven't seen a case like that since 1987. 
 He really has no idea who he is? 
 So it seems. 
 The police are investigating, if you can dignify it with that label. 
 Why don't you go and talk to him, Dr Walker? 
 You're a similar age. See what you can find out. - What exactly do you want me to do? 
 Examine, chat, interrogate. 
 Just make him open up. 
 Use your feminine wiles. 
 Oh, about the child at the school... 
 And then come and find me! 
 What is it telling you, exactly? 
 I'm testing your pupil reaction. 
 Also, it looks professional. 
 You're sure you're a real doctor? 
 Honestly? 
 This isn't really my area but the boss asked me to examine you. 
 I need to make it look good, so... 
 Just go with it, OK? 
 So what is your area? 
 Paediatrics -- kids. 
 At least it was. 
 Now I'm meant to turn my hand to anything. In a foreign language. 
 So do you remember anything? 
 Parents? 
 Friends? 
 Nothing. 
 Aren't you scared? 
 I would be. 
 The other doctor said it usually comes back... eventually. 
 But what if it doesn't? 
 Would that be such a bad thing? 
 I'd be scared. I mean... 
 My life hasn't exactly been perfect, but... 
 .. I'd want to know it happened. 
 But haven't you ever dreamed of a new life? 
 To just wipe the slate clean, start again? 
 Sometimes the past isn't something you want back. 
 Something doesn't quite add up. 
 Which is? 
 I'm not sure. It's just a feeling. 
 The woman who works in the corner shop has feelings. 
 Doctors work in specifics. Well? 
 If you lost your life, everything that makes you who you are, wouldn't you want it back, more than anything else in the world? 
 Precisely. 
 Dr Fonseca! 
 We'll make a real doctor of you yet. 
 Get me 200 milligrams of hydrocortisone. 
 We'll need some adrenaline. 
 Magdalena! Is that you? 
 It's his late wife. He keeps asking for her. 
 What the hell's keeping Dr Varma? 
 Hurry up with those steroids, please. 
 And get that priest back. 
 I commend you, my dear brother, to Almighty God, and entrust you to your Creator. 
 May you return to Him who formed you from the dust of the earth. 
 May the holy Virgin Mary, the angels, and all the saints come to meet you, as you go forth... 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 What happens now? 
 We wait. 
 And pray. 
 Come! 
 I've given you a whole day. How much time do you need? 
 The correct procedures must be adhered too. 
 Typical man. 
 Obsessed with rules and incapable of getting results. 
 Dr Fonseca, I must formally protest. 
 To regard all men as equally useless is prejudice at its most vile. 
 You had your chance and found nothing. 
 And don't you lecture me on prejudice. 
 We women, as usual, will have to deal with this ourselves. 
 You can't just retire. What about my alcohol supply? 
 Old men must make way for youth. 
 Oh. 
 Dr Fonseca. Can I get you a drink? 
 Anyone who drinks before 6pm is a dipsomaniac. 
 You insult both my customers and my business model. 
 I need your help. 
 'He's really got no memory?' 
 He says his mind is a complete blank. 
 I want you to talk to him. You have a lot in common. 
 I've heard nothing round here. Could ask around again, find some people further up the coast, if I wasn't so busy today. 
 Come on. You'll be doing a vital public service! 
 And you're asking an idiot man like me? 
 Indication of my desperation. 
 If you weren't so nice to me, I might take off... 
 Careful. There are plenty more options, you know. 
 Yet, night after night, you consistently refuse them. 
 I don't pretend to understand, Dr Fonseca. 
 I just lie back and think of England. 
 Are you refusing to help me? 
 I didn't say that. 
 Perhaps there's something you could do for me first. 
 Vikram? 
 Vikram? 
 Age-related cervical spondylosis. 
 Retirement is the only option. 
 That's your advice? 
 You'll have to get your booze from a legitimate wholesaler. 
 Where did you get that? 
 Found it on the beach today. 
 I can't read it. I think it's Russian. 
 That's not Russian, that's Hebrew. 
 I need to take this. Or we can discuss my fee? 
 Thank you. 
 He's Israeli. 
 Private Silver? 
 I think you'd better start talking, don't you? 
 I threw this in the water. 
 I thought I was done with the Army. 
 My unit has been here for a week on leave. 
 Yesterday was my last night. 
 Suddenly, I just knew that I couldn't go back there. 
 I knew I couldn't be a soldier any more. 
 I'd asked to be released but they told me it would be impossible. 
 So I went to the beach. 
 I wanted to walk, to think. 
 Then I saw the moon. 
 It was as if it was calling out to me. 
 And in that moment, it felt like the only answer. 
 You wanted to die? 
 I think I did... 
 .. last night. 
 I don't believe in God. 
 Something saved me. 
 Something wanted me to live and to leave the past behind. 
 A new life. 
 All I had to do was forget the old one. 
 Do you have a family back home? 
 A mother in Tel Aviv, a sister... 
 And they love you, this family? 
 Yes, they do. 
 Do you think they'll forget you? 
 It's my choice... my life. 
 Will your mum forget you when she walks down the street? 
 Or will she stare at every young man, willing them to be her son? 
 Or will she wait by the phone, hoping and praying to get a call telling her that her missing son has been found safe and well? 
 People here say there's a little magic in the full moon. 
 I say it's nonsense and superstition, but just maybe I'm wrong. 
 Just maybe you're the living proof. 
 Too many lost souls go missing in this world. 
 Don't be one of them. 
 If the full moon saved you, then maybe it saved you for a reason. 
 To go home again. 
 Here. 
 You sensed it too. No real panic, no emotion. 
 Because he was faking. We just had to prove it. 
 Medicine is more than lists and tables, Dr Walker. 
 The real skill is to learn how to read their minds. 
 What will they do to him? 
 Counselling, I expect. 
 Or a military prison. One of the two. 
 You don't care? 
 We all make bad decisions in life. 
 Just don't compound the error. 
 The money you gave my son. 
 What's going on? 
 200, 250... 
 That's the boy from the school. 
 The one I was trying to talk to you about. 
 Huh? 
 How dare you touch my son with that money? 
 He gave her that money to buy food for Vijay, I think. 
 Perhaps he's attempting to atone. 
 Doctor Fonseca? It's Mr Gonzalo. 
 Thank you. 
 What the hell is he doing here? 
 You took bloods without consent? 
 His teacher was concerned about him. 
 Weight loss, failure to thrive, I just did some basic screening. 
 We need parental consent for all medical procedures whatsoever. 
 The rules are as strict here as in the UK. 
 Even if I believe it was in his best interests? 
 You know nothing about the family circumstances. 
 I saw you. 
 I saw you give him that money and I saw her throw it back in your face. 
 Why? 
 That is none of your business. 
 Dr Varma? Nanni. 
 Our appointment? 
 I know you're a busy man, but I haven't got time to sit twiddling my thumbs. 
 Come. 
 So your brain tumour is called anaplastic astrocytoma. 
 Now it's not suitable for surgery. 
 You have declined radiotherapy. 
 So median survival in cases like yours is... 
 Six months to a year. 
 I don't want to go home. 
 If I stay, I need to know you can help me. 
 This is a complex condition. 
 As a doctor, I'd have to recommend that you return home and be cared for by specialists. 
 What if I refuse to go? 
 What if I refuse to help you? 
 If ifs and buts were pots and pans, we'd have no need for tinkers. 
 I'm sorry, I have absolutely no idea what you just said. 
 I have fallen in love, Dr Varma. 
 With this place. With India. 
 I've lived on this planet for over 60 years and I never knew a heaven like this even existed. 
 I need to know you understand the risk. 
 The treatment we can offer you here is basic. 
 Now, if there's an emergency, we may not be able to help. 
 And if that happens... you will die here. 
 That's the plan. 
 Ssh. 
 Don't tell anyone. 
 I understand. 
 Help me. Please. 
 What does your husband think about this, about staying in Barco? 
 He's behind me 150%. 
 So... do we have a deal, then? 
 Against my better judgement... yes. 
 See? I'm gonna get it all in. 
 I know you thought you'd defeat me, but guess what? 
 You can fold your way out of any crisis. 
 What? 
 I don't understand. 
 What have we got to go back to? I mean, really? 
 Home, family. 
 NH bloody S. 
 I've checked. The local hospital will take care of me. 
 Oh, great. Oh, that's fine, then. 
 Silly me, worrying about nothing. 
 You know I hate it when you're sarcastic. 
 And I hate it when you get diagnosed with a brain tumour and decide on a whim to stay in bloody India! 
 Christ! Oh, bollocks! 
 I just don't get it. What's this about, Maggie? 
 Make me understand what the hell this is about. 
 You remember that time we went to the South of France on the back of that... damn motorbike? 
 '72. 
 '73. 
 And three miles outside Lyon, I told you I was pregnant. 
 And you didn't say a word. 
 Just put your helmet on and we set off. 
 Then at the next stop, you asked me to marry you. 
 I remember. 
 I loved that trip. 
 But that was the last time... it was just you and me. 
 The two of us together. 
 Like the rest of the world didn't exist. 
 Then it was... the kids, family, your bloody mother. 
 But you and me... was how it all started. 
 And you and me... 
 .. is how I want it to end. 
 Together. 
 Please. 
 You know how much this bloody place costs? 
 We can't afford to stay here. 
 Don't worry. 
 I've thought of that already. 
 What do you think? 
 Lovely. 
 Look at this. 
 Coming through. Yeah. 
 So how did you manage to replace me? 
 I called for an ambulance. 
 So? 
 Waved me across the border. 
 I told them they could look inside but only if I vaccinated them all for Lydia Fever first. 
 Lydia Fever? 
 I made it up. Deadly, no cure. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Right. 
 Champagne! 
 One beer, one pina colada. 
 Fully loaded. I've gone legit. 
 Everything imported fair and square. 
 Of course, now I'm losing money on the deal. 
 Sometimes life has a way of rewarding the virtuous. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 I'm still worried about Vijay and Dr Varma. 
 It was nearly five years ago. 
 Vijay's father was an extremely anxious man, always at the hospital, complaining of one spurious malady or another. 
 Always nothing. 
 This time it was lower abdominal pain. 
 Gabriel didn't consider it serious, sent him away. 
 His wife was with him. 
 I met her. 
 She called her husband lots of names and dragged him home. 
 Next morning, she found him dead from a ruptured appendix. 
 As you can imagine, Gabriel took it very hard. 
 A wife without a husband, a fatherless child. 
 And she blames him. 
 We doctors can bury our mistakes, it doesn't mean we can ever forget them. 
 I'm gonna... 
 Hi. 
 I erm... spoke to Lydia. 
 She told me about Vijay's dad. 
 She shouldn't have told you. 
 Well, I'm glad she did. 
 In case you hadn't noticed, this is an official apology. 
 I was younger, I was arrogant. 
 I thought I knew everything. 
 Unlike now, right? 
 We all get it wrong sometimes. 
 Vijay's mum shouldn't blame you. 
 Well, I disagree. 
 Thanks to me, her husband is dead. 
 Our actions have consequences. 
 Sometimes there are no excuses. 
 How's the study? 
 I was er... sort of persuaded. 
 So I see. 
 Can I get you a beer? 
 You're alone? 
 Yeah, looks that way. 
 And this is what I call a Full Moon Fandango. 
 Ooh! 
 Enjoy! Love in a glass. 
 Cheers. 
 Be gentle with him. 
 Evening. 
 Morning! 
 Pina Colada. 
 Guaranteed hangover-proof. 
 I'll try and keep that in mind. 
 And to stay on speaking terms with your liver, avoid the Mumbai Scotch. 
 Greg swore it was ten years old. 
 There's one born every minute, Dr Varma. 
 However, your nocturnal activities are none of my business. 
 Here are the blood results to be checked and filed. 
 And once the analgesia takes effect, you can both meet me on the wards. 
 What do you want? 
 Can I come in? 
 It's about Vijay. 
 Dr Walker. 
 Vijay is intolerant to gluten. 
 It explains everything -- the weight loss, lack of concentration. 
 Coeliac disease is unusual in India but not unknown. 
 You told her? 
 Mm-hm, first thing. 
 She seemed happy. 
 She didn't slam the door in my face. 
 "Well done, Dr Walker. Nice work back there. 
 Congratulations." 
 Mm-hm. 
 How is she? 
 Well... 
 The odds were against it, but... I think she's going to pull through.
