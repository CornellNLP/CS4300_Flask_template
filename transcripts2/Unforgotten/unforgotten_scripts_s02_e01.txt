 Sunil on phone : Say again? Why can't Chigwell pick it up, or Edmonton? 
 I'm not sure, really. Andrews just rang me and told me it was ours. 
 Hold on one second, please. 
 Will you two please be quiet? I'm on a work call! 
 Yeah, sorry - Listen. Listen, I know it's late. 
 For me it was either this or Time Team Revisited, so... 
 (GIRLS CONTINUE TO ARGUE) 
 You coming past me? 
 Mum, it was my birthday. 
 So, what time did it finish? 
 God... four, maybe five. 
 Your neighbours must love you. 
 They were the last to leave. 
 And was Alice there? 
 Alice and I split. Oh! Right, another one I never met. 
 I'm not sure you would've liked her anyway, so... 
 It doesn't matter what I think of her, Jase. 
 I just want you to be happy. Yeah. 
 You want another one? 
 Erm... 
 Well, go on, then. A quick one. Then I should shift. Paul's cooking. 
 Yeah, me too. The flat's totalled. 
 I mean... my sister did it. 
 When she split up with Michael. 
 No. It's not really my thing. 
 Well, one in four marriages last year started online. 
 Yeah, I'm sure. 
 I just don't really fancy ending up standing in front of some bloke I've been on three dates with in my bra and knickers. 
 That bit never bothers me. 
 What? 
 You in your bra and knickers? 
 Evening. Evening, sir. 
 Which way? 
 Just go over the bridge... 
 Thank you. 
 Because...  
 What? 
 Because you want to watch EastEnders, or because wanna go out, or...? 
 Because you're feeling sick? 
 I'm always feeling sick, fucktard. 
 On account of the cancer. 
 Do you have cancer? 
 Just... Really, what's the point? 
 Oh, yeah, I know. 
 You do everything you're meant to do and you fight with every fibre in your body and it turns out cancer doesn't give a sh1t. 
 So, by all means, have a cry... and just tell me that you're scared. 
 And if you like you can give up in here as well, cos that's not really gonna make a difference, but... 
 Please, please don't stop taking the chemo, cos in the end, that is all we've got. 
 Never ever become a therapist. 
 Now please, piss off before I top myself. 
 And according to the local council, the river was last dredged in 1994. 
 Right. Obviously that doesn't necessarily mean this went in the water after then. 
 The last dredge could've just missed it. 
 Sorry, to me, this looks way too preserved to have been in here for any serious length of time. 
 Ordinarily I'd agree, but there are potentially a couple of unusual factors here. 
 Firstly, the body was in a sealed case - meaning very little got in for quite some time, I imagine. 
 And then secondly, if the conditions are right, sometimes a body that's been left in water undergoes a chemical change called saponification. 
 Which, effectively, seals and preserves the body. 
 So, how old could it be? 
 Hard to say, but easily... five, ten, 20 years? Maybe longer. 
 Wow! Male, do you think? Cos that looks like a bloke's watch. 
 Let me get everything back to my lab. 
 We'll get the remains out, clean them up and see where we are. 
 Yeah. Call me when you're ready. 
 Thanks, Fran. 
 Popular picnic spot apparently. 
 All the people who sat here... 
 Families, lovers, old ladies eating their egg and cress and just a few yards away... 
 I hate egg and cress. 
 Do you? Mm. 
 I don't mind it. 
 No? What's your sandwich of choice, then? 
 Wouldn't be a sandwich. A crusty, white roll, grated cheese and onion. 
 White bread gives you cancer. 
 Yeah, that's what they say today. 
 Next week... the key to everlasting life. 
 Hi, jason. Oh, hi, Cath. 
 Sorry about your party. I had to work late, and by the time we got back your lights wereout. 
 Yeah, oh, well. Everyone was knackered, so it wasn't a late one. 
 Another time maybe? 
 Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice. 
 Do you wanna fix a date now or...? 
 Well... let me have a look at my diary and I'll Sure. 
 No problem. Night, Cath. 
 Hiya. In here. 
 Hey, love. How'd it go? 
 Fine. 
 What? 
 Oh, just... 
 Well, they're all lovely and everything but... 
 They're all little, old ladies, aren't they? 
 And you're an old man. Old man. 
 Yes. Well, thanks for that. 
 I'm gonna head up. Dad... 
 Sorry, no, I didn't mean - No, no, it's all right. 
 I'm just feeling a bit bushed. 
 I'll see you in the morning. 
 Love you. 
 How about I get an extra flight to Spain? 
 Becca wouldn't mind. He's always great company. 
 Paul... that is so kind of you. 
 Oh! Come on. Hey! 
 He'll be OK. 
 Mm? 
 He's a cracking lad. 
 Someone will see that one day. 
 They will. Mm. 
 Hm? 
 Oh! 
 On three. One, two, three. 
 Yeah, as I suspected it is a Blanchard. 
 You can just see that mark on this rim. 
 Oh, I've never heard of it. 
 They went out of business in the early '905. 
 The seals kept going, which wasn't brilliant on a diving watch. 
 Don't they have serial numbers inside? 
 Not this model, annoyingly. 
 So, not helpful then, in terms of dating the body. 
 Maybe we should be concentrating on the suitcase. 
 Well, this is a watch, although not a premium one, it still cost the best part of a grand. 
 So if it goes wrong, you get it fixed. Any watchmaker fixing a watch, will leave a little mark on the inside plate. 
 Now, if I can get this off we might find the date, firstly. 
 But more importantly, we might find a name. 
 So if this watch was fixed at some point... you think we could probably identify the watchmaker? 
 If we can identify them... 
 They might be able to tell us whose watch it was. 
 ♪♪ 
 In mitigation, Your Honour, I would ask you consider the side of jordan that he hides, very successfully, from any figure of authority he comes into contact with. 
 And that is the side of this young man who spent all the profits accrued from selling the drugs he was arrested for on a week at a holiday camp for his younger brother Liam. 
 If I may... 
 The younger brother, who, like jordan, was taken into care before he turned six. 
 The fact is, Your Honour, what jordan needs... 
 In fact, what he desperately wants is help with his addiction. 
 Because jordan is, at heart, a kind and decent young man. 
 And Iwould ask that we help him show the world what he is truly capable of. 
 Laters, bruv. I sincerely hope not. 
 Say hi to Liam for me. Will do. 
 See ya, Col! 
 Oh! 
 Excuse me! 
 Are you serious? 
 The most important day of our lives. 
 Nearly gave me a bloody heart attack. 
 Oh, what you worried about? We've got at least 15 seconds. 
 Oh, just hold me up for a minute. 
 Daddies! Hey! 
 Oh, hi! 
 Oh, my darling girl. Shall we go home? 
 Yeah. You all right? You ready? 
 Yeah. Yeah? 
 Good. 
 I'll take that. You all set? Oh, she's been so excited. Bye, Janet. 
 Bye, Flo! Bye! 
 Bye, Flo! 
 Pizza! Pizza? 
 Oh, yes. 
 And carrot sticks? 
 No. 
 And some fruit. 
 Smith? 
 I'm afraid so. But we do have an initial. 
 W Smith? 
 12/06/89. Yep. 
 And 04/02/90. 
 In the absence of a serial number this is your best bet of identifying the owner. 
 Jake : 'So, I've started in january, 1990.' 
 Yeah, good. 
 'And for now I've taken it up to 1995.' 
 Fair enough. 
 'And that brings up only 1.5 million missing persons.' 
 Oh, please. Now, as we're pretty sure it's male... that narrows it down to about 750,000. 
 Still missing after five years - that narrows it down to 1% of that figure. 
 Yeah, that's still 7,500. 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 Yeah, hold fire on that for now. 
 Thanks, jake. 'Cool.' 
 I think that's it there. 
 Obviously there are quite a number of Smiths. 
 Though the initial does narrow it down quite a bit. 
 I should also say there are many thousands of watch repairers who don't belong to our guild, and we don't keep records of. 
 Right. 
 But listen... Give me half an hour. I'll see what I can do. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (MOBILE RINGS) 
 Oh, will you excuse me? 
 Dr East, how we doing? 
 'Come, you spirits, that tend on mortal thoughts. Unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the toe top, full of direst cruelty.' 
 'Unsex me here.' 
 So why is she talking about s*x in this scene? 
 Why, we might suppose that she has more important things on her mind? 
 What's more important than s*x? 
 Why is she saying this? 
 Janice. Cos she isn't talking about s*x in that way. 
 She means, like, gender. 
 Very good. But women murder. 
 They do. Like Myra Hindley. 
 Charlize Theron. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 No, no, it's a good point Karim's making. 
 But like Aileen Wuornos, who I think you're referring to, like almost all female killers, when women do kill, they generally kill for a man or because of a man. 
 What Shakespeare is saying here is that it's not really in their nature to murder. 
 (BELL) 
 Two sides, please, for Monday. 
 Is Lady Macbeth more evil than her husband? 
 Did I say you could touch me? 
 So there's some lamb burgers in the freezer, and they can have them with spaghetti hoops and broccoli? 
 Oh, I think we're covering all the food groups there. 
 And I should be back by nine-ish. 
 CooL You nervous? 
 No. Terrified. 
 Ah, you'll be fine. How many do you reckon they're seeing? 
 Dunno. Loads, though. 
 I thought you said it was in special measures? 
 Exactly. Who wouldn't want to turn a school like that around? 
 All right. 
 Teachers are weird. 
 Says the man who adds up for a living. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Piss off. Love you. 
 Yeah, love youtoo. Bye. 
 0h! 
 Oh, why not? 
 Well, because I thought we agreed fresh fruit for brekkie, and cos Daddy Colin said no. 
 0h! Right. 
 I knew it would end up being somehow my fault. Please, Daddy! 
 Please, Daddy! 
 All right, one packet. Yes! 
 Look! Nope. Yeah, let's not push it, eh, Flo? 
 Come on, yoghurt. 
 I hope you all die of f*cking AIDS. The kid, too. 
 So, it is a male? 
 Height - approximately 5'9"-5'10". 
 And from the extent of the saponification I'd say he was probably a little overweight. 
 Age wise... I'd estimate somewhere between 30 and 50. 
 OK. 
 Cause of death. 
 It was in his chest cavity. 
 I'm guessing... a kitchen knife? 
 The handle's maybe rotted away or perhaps even snapped off at the time of entry. 
 Right. 
 So, there are blade marks on the fourth and fifth left side ribs here. 
 And here. 
 All of which is consistent with a fatal stab wound to the chest. 
 To the heart? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Based on striations and... the width of the blade, it would certainly have penetrated the heart and the victim would have bled out fairly quickly. 
 OK. 
 So, we found nothing else in the suitcase. 
 But when I was examining the body I... noticed something a bit odd about the area directly below the wound as he was laying. I had a bit of a dig around... and eventually... 
 I pulled out this. 
 What is it? 
 Well, the waxy material is what I told you about, the hydrolysed body fat. 
 Yeah. 
 But it's what it's collected around that's interesting. 
 Jesus! 
 It says 'Andersson', who were a telecoms company. 
 I'm guessing it was in his shirt pocket. 
 And I think it was the remains of a pager. 
 ♪♪ 
 Here we go. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Just a bit nervous, I think. 
 We're gonna be fine. 
 Are we? 
 100%. And in ten weeks' time she'll be ours for good. 
 Trust me. 
 They're not gonna revoke the adoption because we gave her Honey Squares. 
 Right. Seatbelt on, please. OK. I'll open those for you in one second. 
 Done. OK. That's it. Done. OK. 
 Obviously, for your sake, I would've hoped there'd been less. 
 Trust me... I thought it'd be worse. 
 Email the ones that I've marked, and attach of a photo of the watch. 
 And Oliver's photo of the engraved signature. 
 I'm gonna visit some of the Central London ones in person. 
 Got you. 
 No, that's not me. You sure? 
 Absolutely positive. OK. 
 So the email I sent you. Do you recognise that signature? 
 No? OK, no problem. Probably be back in touch. 
 Thanks for your time. Bye. 
 Not to worry. We have your details if anything changes. Cheers. Bye-bye. 
 OK, thanks for your time. 
 Hiya! In here. 
 There you go. 
 Hello, my darlings. We're having fish fingers again. 
 We've run out of quail's eggs and lark's tongues. 
 Oh, nothing wrong with fish fingers. 
 A fish finger sandwich is one of the finest inventions knownto man. 
 Hear-hear. 
 
 
 
 (DOORBELL) 
 I thought you said five. 
 That's what she told me. 
 Oh, hi, love. 
 Hi. I thought you said five. 
 No, I said four. 
 Party starts at six. 
 Oh, right, four. Well, it's 4:25. 
 Marion, don't start. 
 Tony's just served up, we're still eating. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry, Tony. 
 Sorry, I did tell Marion four. 
 No, she didn't. 
 It's not a problem. 
 Come on, boys, we need to get going because I want you dressed and showered by the time everyone arrives. 
 Want me to doggy bag it? 
 No, I'll give them a sandwich or something when we get home. 
 Thank you so much. 
 All right. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Bye. 
 And don't be late. 
 Bye, boys, we'll see you later. 
 Bye, Aunty Marion. 
 You got everything? 
 Yes, thank you. 
 I go on first. 
 Hey, come on, then. Off we go. jump in the back. Bye! Bye! 
 Ah! 
 How does she manage to be such an annoying bitch? 
 I do not know. 
 What's that? What? 
 Right, that was evil. 
 It's all going in. 
 No... 
 3CX, and that's it. 
 OK. So try Andersson first. 
 See if they can help. 
 OK, thanks, Fran. 
 Hi. I'm looking for Nathan. 
 Yep, that's me. 
 Right. Blimey. 
 Last time I saw you, you just weed your pants all over my sofa. 
 I'm Adam Stuart's mum. 
 Ah, hi, Mrs Stuart. 
 Yeah, he said you might pop in. 
 I mean, you were only nine, so... you know, I've moved on. 
 He said you had a pager that you wanted me to look at. 
 And this was released in...? 
 1989. 
 And did this have a... what? 
 I dunno, SIM or...? 
 This is a pager. SIMs are only in phones, and only 2G, which wasn't launched till '91. 
 OK, so how was information stored on it? 
 It's a basic data chip built into the pager itself. 
 And these chips held how much data? 
 Very little. Maybe last 20 messages. 
 Which was just... Were they just numbers or...? 
 Oh, no, it's alphanumeric. 
 So it could receive messages 29 characters long. 
 OK. So given what I've told you, and where it's been for the last... 
 I dunno, however many years... 
 What do you think the chances are that we could pull any data off it? 
 What we'd need to do is source a working version of this model. 
 How do we do that? 
 eBay. 
 Yeah, and then we de-solder the data chip from this, solder it into the working version and see what we get. 
 But it's possible? 
 It's a microchip made of silicon. 
 Anything's possible. 
 Good to see you, mate. Give my best to Emma. We'll be in touch very soon. 
 Mrs Mahmoud, so sorry to keep you waiting. Would you like to come in? 
 Yes. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 
♪ Happy birthday, dear joy ♪ 
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 
 Hooray! 
 All right, here we go. Wish me luck! 
 Ooh! Come on. Oh, come on, Mum, you can do better than that. 
 Come on! 
 Loads of puff. 
 Hooray! What? 
 No, you're right. It would be a big leap for me, heading up a school. 
 But I've headed up a Sixth Form for five years now and so... I'm confident that I could successfully make the leap. 
 Sorry, said 'leap' twice. 
 With the right support, and Iwould relish the opportunity. 
 So... 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry! Hi, there. 
 Hi. Ijust... 
 I wanted to say... 
 I wanted to say there are gonna be better qualified candidates than me. 
 Better managers, more eloquent speakers, definitely. 
 But I promise you this... 
 You will never, never find a candidate who understands the sorts of kids you have at Highbrook better than me. 
 A woman who left school at 16, who didn't get a single qualification till she was 25. 
 Who knows what it feels like to be written off. 
 What it does to you inside. 
 Which is why I've never written any kid off, no matter how challenging in my entire career. 
 And why, if I got this job, I would fight with my dying breath to make Highbrook the school that every single kid who comes here deserves. 
 And I'd be cheaper, too. 
 Hmm... Thanks for your time. 
 Have a good evening. 
 Oh, I blew a few candles out. Get a life, Elise. Come on! 
 Which I asked you not to do because she said she wanted to do it herself. 
 I can't believe you're making a fuss about this! 
 I just wanted her to be centre of attention for once! 
 Says the woman who insisted on having the party here. 
 We could hardly have got 50 people into your house, could we? 
 She didn't even want 50 people, Elise. 
 Please, do not even try and tell me what Mum wants. 
 You don't even begin to understand what she wants. 
 And you do because you're the golden child. 
 No, I am not the golden child, Marion. 
 I just didn't piss off for the best part of a decade.- Oh, here we go! 
 So the relationship I have with her, I have earned.- Anyone want a top-up? 
 No, we're leaving. 
 What? 
 I'm sure it's what we both want anyway. 
 What the hell happened? 
 I'm so sorry, Tony. 
 You always get caught in the bloody crossfire. 
 All right. Well, say sorry to joy for me. I will. 
 See ya. 
 Marion? 
 Marion! Marion, slow down! 
 If you defend her... If you say one bloody word, I swear... 
 Look, you didn't even say goodbye to - Oh! 
 Marion! 
 Hey, what is going on here? Having fun at this time of night? 
 Come on. It's bed. Come on. Let's go on up. 
 I'll take her. Come on. 
 Good night. Say night night. 
 Love you. Love you. 
 Right, Monkey. I'll race you. 
 Come on. Go, go, go! 
 What if something goes wrong? 
 But what if it doesn't? 
 But what if it does? 
 But what if it doesn't? 
 Come on, you scooch down. 
 You're safe now, Flo. Safe with us. 
 OK? No-one's ever gonna take you away. 
 OK? 
 OK. 
 Love you, sweetheart. Love you, too. 
 Good night, Daddy. 
 See you in the morning. 
 Night night. 
 She's asleep. She's down? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Well done. 
 Excuse me! Excuse me, sir! 
 I think that could be my uncle's signature. 
 ♪♪ 
 She was drunk, that it was a ten-second snog and that it didn't mean anything. 
 Oh! 
 Yeah, well, far be it from me to pass judgment. 
 Here we go. 
 She's clearly a cow. 
 I mean, you don't go getting off with your boyfriend's best mate, do you? 
 It's like some weird porno scenario. 
 How would you know? 
 It's just not normal, is it? 
 (MOBILE RINGS) 
 Oh, sorry, I've got to take this. 
 Sunny? 
 Hey, I think we may have found our watchmaker. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yes, I spoke to a Patrick Smith earlier. Shh! 
 Spoke to a Patrick Smith earlier. He thinks that the signature is his Uncle Bill's. 
 He used to run the business, and he's gonna check I'll speak to him in the morning. 
 OK. Sounds good. 
 How's it going with the pager? 
 Yeah, we found a second-hand one on eBay, so... 
 We'll know one way or the other tomorrow. 
 OK. Well, progress. Yep. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Yeah. 
 Girls! 
 Evening. Oh, hi, love. How'd it go? 
 God, no idea. 
 There's at least ten people going for it, though. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 And the actual interview was a bit of a disaster. 
 Sorry, no offence, Mum, but jesse might be about to kill Gale. No! 
 No way would jesse kill Gale. 
 Not a chance. 
 Bye, sweetheart. Bye, Daddy, I love you. Love you, too. 
 Be good! 
 Colin? 
 Hi. How you doing? 
 Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. How are you? 
 You don't remember my name, do you? 
 Erm... No worries. I'm Tyler. 
 Tyler? 
 Well, of course. You're Milly's dad, is that right? 
 No, no, no. I'm not a parent here. 
 Well, not technically anyway. 
 I'm a stepfather. 
 All right. Who to? 
 Flo. I'm her birth mum's partner. 
 What? What the hell? 
 It's OK. 
 Look, Ijust wanna talk. 
 About what? You shouldn't be making contact with me. Colin, it's... No, no, no. 
 How the hell did you find out where...? 
 It doesn't matter, I can't talk. 
 Of course you can. 
 I saw you yesterday, in the supermarket. 
 Have you followed us? 
 I can guess what he said to you, that bloke, so I don't blame you for what you did. 
 It would've made me pretty angry, too. 
 But I guess others might not be so sympathetic. 
 What, with you being a lawyer and everything. 
 What do you want? 
 Like I said, just to talk. 
 With the greatest respect, 25 years of this mob is enough for anyone. 
 Well, I hope that it goes without saying that you'll be very sorely missed. 
 No, in all seriousness, I've loved every single minute of it. 
 Well, you were always a natural, Tess. 
 I suspect it's gonna be early next year. Probably April. just let me know as soon as you decide. 
 We'll start organising a party. 
 Absolutely. 
 What are we going to do without you, Tess? Ah! 
 All right, T. 
 The wonders of eBay. Hmm. 
 So, pleased be prepared for this not to work at all. 
 The data chip could be damaged as I remove it. 
 It could be damaged as I put it in the new pager. 
 It's OK. I get it. 
 I'll call you. 
 Or I can wait. 
 I'll call you. 
 OK. 
 I don't wanna be here. You know, I have pride like you. 
 And I love Flo. 
 You know, we both did. 
 Do. 
 But if you knew the childhood Sal had had... 
 Cos she was never taught how you do it, you see - be a good mum. 
 How much do you want? She's been clean for three months now, Col. 
 Colin. Which is the longest time ever. 
 Which makes it even harder knowing Flo's in the same city just a few miles away, being brought up by someone else. 
 And she absolutely knows it's the best for Flo. 
 How much? 
 £5,000. just to move. Money for a van and a deposit on a flat. 
 We've seen a place in Hastings. 
 We're not bad people, Colin. We just want the same as you - the best for Flo. 
 I need to think. 
 Give me your number, I'll call you. 
 Yeah, but just remember, Zoe, as hard as this is for you, I actually sometimes think it's harder for them. 
 I can't imagine anything worse than being a parent and seeing your child in pain, and not being able to do anything about it. 
 So maybe you just need to cut them a little slack sometimes. 
 You know, cos they're under immense pressure, too, aren't they? 
 Yeah. 
 OK. Listen, I've gotta go but I'll see you on the ward on Friday, OK? 
 Bye. All right, bye, love. 
 Hiya! Who was that? 
 Oh, it was Zoe, the girl with Non-Hodgkin's. 
 Oh, right. She's got your personal number? 
 How was your morning? 
 Yeah, great. I got the sash windows Great. Listen, I gotta shift cos I'm on at two. 
 Marion? 
 Yeah? 
 Er... do you wanna talk about last night? 
 I'm really late, love. 
 See ya. 
 Here we go. 
 Three months either side of when the repairs were done. 
 Ah, brilliant. Thank you. Good luck. 
 So, I got Patrick Smith to dig out the business account statements for three months either side of the dates the repairs were done. 
 I thought that if I could find payments that were made on or around the repair dates that were made by the same person... 
 Chances are that could be our man. 
 So I did. 
 First one's here... 
 Was made on 21st of june, 1989 - a week or so after the first repair. 
 Credit card payment made by Mr D Walker. 
 And the second one... made on February the 14th, 1990 - about ten days after the repair. 
 Payment made by Mr D Walker. Genius. 
 Then I checked Missing Persons... 
 And... here he is... 
 Mr D Walker. 
 'David Ewan Walker. 39 years old. Last seen on the 8th of May, 1990. 5'9" tall, blue eyes, brown hair. Last seen in the Cricketers Public House, Cannon Street, London. If you have any information on David's whereabouts, please call Winston Hill Police Station and help reunite David with his wife... and five-year-old son... who desperately wants his daddy to come home.' 
 Hello. Hello. We're looking for Tessa Walker. 
 I'm DCI Cassie Stuart. 
 This is DI Sunil Khan. 
 I'm Tessa Nixon. I haven't been Walker for eight years. 
 Right. Can we come in, Mrs Nixon? 
 Why? Can we? 
 Is this...? 
 Is this David? 
 Yes, we think so. 
 Where did you find him? 
 His remains were found in a river. 
 In a river? 
 The Lea. 
 So, when do you think he died? 
 Probably not long after he went missing. 
 How on earth does a body survive 26 years in a river? 
 I'm a copper myself. I've seen what water does to a body. 
 How... how do you even start to identify remains from that long ago? 
 His remains were found in a suitcase. 
 I assumed... that it was suicide. 
 Wasn't it? 
 We've found pretty good evidence to suggest that David was murdered. 
 0h! (PHONE BUZZES) 
 I'm so sorry. 
 That was your husband, Mrs Nixon. 
 He's on his way now. 
 So, what are the next steps? 
 Well, we'll need a DNA swab from your son, if that's OK to confirm that it is David. 
 And obviously we'll be accessing the original files into his disappearance. 
 But in light of these new developments, when would it be convenient for us to talk further with you? 
 We could do it here. 
 Or at our station. 
 What about tomorrow, after lunch maybe? 
 Yeah. Fine. 
 Thank you. 
 Once again... I am so sorry for your loss. 
 63% of all murder victims are killed by their partners. 
 You'll be thinking that, won't you? 
 I would be. 
 We'll see you tomorrow, Tessa. Yeah. 
 Well, she looked how you'd expect, didn't she? 
 Shocked. Upset. 
 But... But she'd know how to fake it better than most. 
 (MOBILE RINGS) 
 Oh! Nathan. 
 We have some code. It's binary. 
 Right. And that's good? 
 I need to do some work on it. 
 But right now, we have a date - 
 15th of February, 1990. 
 And we have words, with lots more to come, I reckon. 
 Thank you, Nathan. Night. 
 And so it begins.
