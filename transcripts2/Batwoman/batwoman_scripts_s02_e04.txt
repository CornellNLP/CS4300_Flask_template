 [Whethan and grandson's "all in my head" playing] 
 Grandson: ♪ all in my ♪  ♪ All in my ♪  ♪ Jump ♪  ♪ I'm stuck with these voices... ♪  Vesper: as if there were a shortage of syringes  In gotham's gutters,  A new party drug just hit the streets  That apparently makes an amphetamine high  Feel like your earl grey has steeped for too long. 
 It seems the gang known as the false face society 
Is showing their entrepreneurial side  By making and distributing snakebite,  Known for its dual-pronged injector needles,  Which are said to give a double whammy dose  Of fantasy and fright,  So more fang for your buck. 
 This trippy two-for-one is part psychedelic mushroom oil,  Part concentrated fear toxin. 
 It's already sunk its teeth into the city,  Becoming the most sought-after high on the street. 
 Users are calling it the ultimate escapism,  But doctors warn that snakebite is as lethal as it is addictive. 
 Talk to me, gotham. 
 Am I the only one  Who's feeling rattled? 
 Grandson: ♪ I'm stuck with these voices ♪  ♪ They're all in my head ♪  Are you... 
 Are you real? 
 You're throwing your life away. 
 That crap will kill you. 
 Certainly get you close. 
 That's the point. 
 Fear, fantasy,  Whatever makes your blood pump. 
 Who sold you this stuff? 
 Sorry. 
 Can't give a plug. 
 Aah! 
 I will ask you this just one more time. 
 Who is your dealer? 
 [Engine revs, tires squeal] 
 Target acquired. 
 Luke: you're not actually gonna run him over, right? 
 And ruin my new paint job? 
 [High-pitched squeal] 
 What the? 
 Tommy: you're not batwoman! 
 [Batmobile beeping] 
 [Horn honking] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Luke: what was that? 
 Ryan: I don't know. 
 Steering got a little stiff. 
 Huh! 
 [Groans] 
 You get off on ruining lives? 
 I don't tell my clients what to do. 
 Well, I'm gonna tell you what to do. 
 Stop destroying lives! 
 Who's your boss? 
 [Alarm ringing] 
 [Grunting] 
 You tell him I will find  The head of the snake,  And I will cut it off. 
 I couldn't get the bat-light, so I yanked the door. 
 You set this off? 
 My brother left for school,  And he never showed up. 
 He's been gone for 3 months,  And nobody cares. 
 Do you care, batwoman? 
 Jacob: I have received intelligence  Suggesting that my daughter kate kane is alive. 
 I believe that she survived the crash  Or perhaps wasn't even on the aircraft to begin with. 
 I also believe that my daughter is collateral damage  Between two warring parties,  And I am personally offering a million-dollar cash reward  To anyone who can provide information into who took her  Or how that happened. 
 Reporter: what do you tell critics who think  This is a futile attempt to rectify  Your failed search for beth kane? 
 Well, i--i tell them that I am a father who needs your help  To find his daughter,  And this search will not fail. 
 Thank you. 
 Dewitt: with the largest cash reward in gotham history,  Crows commander jacob kane has galvanized the city  To help find his daughter kate kane,  Now publicly declared missing. 
 Are you seeing this? 
 All this press combined with a $1 million reward? 
 We're gonna find kate. 
 [Sighs] 
 -What? 
 -Nothing. 
 Sophie just told us that kate is alive  On an island in the mediterranean. 
 Yeah, and the person who told sophie  That kate's alive is named alice,  And alice heard it from some mystery woman named safiyah,  Who just hired a hitman to try and kill me,  So we are playing a game of telephone  With a bunch of homicidal women. 
 Or alice is telling the truth,  And kate needs us to find her. 
 Or she's not, and we're getting  Our hopes up for nothing. 
 See, alice can't get my hopes up  Because I never lost hope to begin with. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where are you going? 
 To work with someone  Who wants to find kate as badly as I do. 
 Anchor: local firemen rushed to the scene of a... 
 Ryan: hey. 
 Team meeting. 
 Where's luke? 
 Burrowing down a rabbit hole. 
 Well, clearly, you're free today. 
 We've got ourselves a batmission. 
 Black, male, foster kid, juvie. 
 In case you're wondering why gcpd isn't looking for him,  Those 5 words. 
 They probably just wrote him off as a runaway. 
 How long has he been missing? 
 Couple of months. 
 Oh, wait. 
 I once lived in the neighborhood he's from--  Wayside heights, aka wasteside. 
 Is that where you lived with cora? 
 No. 
 Wasteside was years before mama found me. 
 This was one of the group homes,  But there was nothing homey about it. 
 Girl: check it. 
 New girl. 
 Hi. 
 I'm ryan. 
 I'm 12. 
 My favorite animal's the snow leopard. 
 My favorite color's yellow. 
 My last foster parents said I watch too much tv. 
 Did your last foster mama tell you that you  Talk too damn much? 
 Ha ha ha! 
 [Rap on window] 
 Girl, muffled: yo. 
 Open up. 
 I know you hear me. 
 Thanks. 
 Gonna get your ass busted. 
 Gonna be boring your whole life. 
 Am I on your bed or something? 
 No. 
 I'm just nosy. 
 "Ghost kid"? 
 He ain't a superhero. 
 -Says who? 
 -All he can do is be invisible. 
 Maybe people who feel invisible think he's dope. 
 Who? 
 Like you? 
 For the record, I see you. 
 New rule. 
 You keep opening that window for me,  And I've got your back when you need someone. 
 Mary: so do you remember the area? 
 Ryan? 
 The police report says he disappeared  Between home and school. 
 Well, worth checking out his route. 
 Field trip? 
 I'll drive. 
 -The batmobile? 
 -Eh. 
 I actually love vintage vans. 
 Well, uh, my carburetor chokes,  Fuel leaks, and I don't have any air bags,  But, yeah, if you want to take a selfie  In my living room for insta, be my guest. 
 Wait. 
 You, like, live here live here. 
 Like, full-time? 
 Who else would keep my plant company? 
 Wait. 
 Hold up. 
 [Gears grinding] 
 What are we doing here? 
 Give me a sec. 
 Young ryan: crap. 
 [Spinner rack squeaking] 
 Garbage. 
 Yes! 
 What you doing, sweetie? 
 I'm not stealing. 
 These are free. 
 Oh, don't worry. 
 I'm not police. 
 Around here, I'm known  As the neighborhood candy lady. 
 Jelly bean? 
 -Nah. 
 -Heh. 
 So...my son... 
 Just left for boarding school--  Heh--and now, I got a minivan full of comic books. 
 I was just about to donate them,  But, uh, maybe you might want to pick through them first. 
 Depends. 
 What's he all got? 
 Too many, and by the looks of your stash,  I'm guessing your mom has the same problem I do, huh? 
 Heh heh. 
 I'm good. 
 Thanks. 
 No worries, sweetie. 
 Just an offer. 
 Well, I'll just get these inside. 
 Happy hunting! 
 Wait. 
 Maybe I'll take a peek. 
 Why...are we here? 
 Because I think kevin was grabbed from here to be brainwashed  And sold to a gang. 
 And you got all that  From a janky comic book storefront? 
 I got all that because the same damn thing  Happened to me. 
 [Alice humming] 
 Oh. 
 Let me guess. 
 You're not a morning person. 
 What the hell are you doing in my condo? 
 Sampling the products in your guest bath. 
 Of course your theme is lavender. 
 Alice! 
 Fine. 
 Allow me to remind you  What happened less than 48 hours ago  When I explained to you I made a deal with safiyah for kate. 
 She gives me kate, and in return,  You and I help her find someone. 
 I don't need to partner with you to find kate. 
 Well, now that I think about it,  You do have double locks on all your doors,  No fashionable attire--  I looked-- and not a single thing  Past its expiration date in your fridge. 
 Risk terrifies you,  And I'm a risk, and it's quite obvious  That you're not willing to risk anything for my sister,  So I'm sure you'll find kate the safe, regimented,  By-the-books way. 
 Seems to have gotten you pretty far. 
 Cute press conference by the way. 
 A million-dollar reward is sure to get the woman  Who owns an island to spill the beans. 
 Stop. 
 What do we need to do? 
 You need to power up your computer  And use that "all-access" crows pass of yours  To find a guy named ocean,  And i... 
 Need some more milk for tea... 
 Partner. 
 Whelan, get art an antiquities started  On finding the original. 
 This is the mysterious jack napier piece. 
 -Yeah. 
 -It's hideous. 
 Who's safiyah? 
 The woman who has my daughter apparently. 
 We can't locate her, but since this was  The last thing on kate's phone, we think it will help. 
 It was stolen apparently from an active crime scene  And is now rumored to be bouncing around the black market. 
 On it, sir. 
 Ryan: the clerk remembered seeing a minivan lurking  Around the comic book store. 
 That means it's possible she's still stalking that place  All these years later. 
 You're telling me a woman's been lurking in the shadows,  Plucking kids off the street  -For the last decade and a half? 
 -That's the point. 
 She doesn't need shadows. 
 She's a blue-eyed suburban housewife  Who targets kids no one cares about. 
 She figures out who has a family, who doesn't,  And then she makes her move. 
 She sprayed something in my face. 
 I was so disoriented by the time I woke up,  I couldn't figure out where the hell I was. 
 Does wayne have cameras in wayside? 
 Mary: I don't know. 
 [Ryan typing] 
 What'd this monster do to you, ryan? 
 What did she do? 
 She preyed on every foster kid's greatest fear,  That we don't matter because we're invisible. 
 Young ryan: let me go! 
 You can't keep me here. 
 Well, when someone comes to claim you, you can leave,  But until then,  I'm just a good samaritan who found a lost child  Wandering the streets. 
 There's nothing good about you! 
 That's not true. 
 Look. 
 There are 60 jelly beans in this jar,  And every day that you're here, I'll remove one,  And by the time there are no more jelly beans left,  You'll realize I am the only one who's here for you. 
 Me...the sweet neighborhood candy lady. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 I'm gonna help you find your new family,  One who appreciates you,  One who sees you for your true potential. 
 Someone will come for me and kick your ass! 
 You're not gonna break me. 
 Do you really believe that? 
 Think about it. 
 In all those comic books  That you love so much,  Have you ever read about one of those heroes  Saving a kid like you? 
 Ryan: the sad truth is she was right. 
 Heroes didn't save kids like me. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Honestly, so much crap has happened since,  I hadn't thought about it much till now,  But the thing I remember is  By the time kevin gets to the bottom  Of this candy jar the candy lady will have him believe  He has no other choice. 
 [Door opens] 
 Don't stop on my behalf. 
 It's normal to want to leave. 
 Strange place, strange people. 
 Ha ha ha! 
 But soon it won't seem so strange. 
 I'm here for my jelly bean. 
 Someone will notice I'm missing. 
 Wouldn't that be a nice change of pace? 
 [Door shuts] 
 That's when our little game started. 
 She had 60 days to break me,  And I had 60 days to prove her wrong. 
 [Door opens] 
 Good morning, sweetie. 
 [Door shuts] 
 [Door opens] 
 Still no inquiries. 
 Tck. 
 Batman stopped the joker last night. 
 It's all over the news! 
 Unfortunately... 
 You're not. 
 [Jelly beans rattling] 
 [Door shuts, locks] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Lock turns] 
 Young ryan: what are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 Shh! 
 Don't you make a sound. 
 [Door shuts, locks] 
 Good morning, ma'am. 
 We're wondering  If you can help us with a missing persons case. 
 We're volunteers from gotham u looking  For this girl last seen a couple weeks ago. 
 Got a lot of people worried. 
 Ryan: I never saw her nervous, never saw her sweat,  But when I heard those voices outside the window,  I knew why. 
 [Muffled] 
 I'm here! 
 I saw that search party outside,  And I thought I'd done it,  Thought I'd won. 
 I thought I had proved to that bitch  That I was worth something to someone. 
 Help me! 
 I'm here! 
 That is so upsetting. 
 Uh, what does the little girl look like? 
 [Banging] 
 She's 13, fair skin, blue eyes. 
 [Echoing] 
 fair skin, blue eyes. 
 She was last seen wearing a necklace with a red stone. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 That is just awful. 
 I will definitely keep my eyes peeled. 
 Ryan: but they weren't looking for me. 
 They were looking for some white girl  Because when white girls go missing,  People get off their asses,  And they do something about it. 
 [Computer beeping] 
 Hang on. 
 A search team was looking for a 13-year-old white girl  Wearing a red stone necklace? 
 I now how to find the candy lady. 
 -How? 
 -That girl was beth kane. 
 You mind? 
 I really thought you'd be better at this. 
 We're looking for a man named ocean. 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 -I'm happy to tell you  Everything you want to know about the 7 seas,  But there's only so far I can get without a last name. 
 Yeah. 
 Coryana doesn't really do last names. 
 Safiyah, ocean, tatiana. 
 It's all very biblical. 
 Then we need another angle. 
 In hindsight, I don't know why  I thought you could help me figure out who this person is  Considering you didn't even know you were swapping spit  With your former flame. 
 I think it's time for you to go. 
 And I think you're haunted. 
 Kate disappeared with so much left unsaid  Between you two, and it's killing you,  Which is precisely why I want to work with you--  Because you'll stop at nothing to find her. 
 Is that what you are? 
 Haunted? 
 What do you want me to say, soph,  That I miss my sister more than anything,  That I regret spending the last year  Terrorizing her,  Now that she's gone I realize  How much she meant to me? 
 If it's the truth. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Luke: yo, sophie. 
 It's luke fox. 
 I can't be seen working with you. 
 -I totally understand. 
 -Alice, don't! 
 What the hell? 
 I didn't order takeout,  But I'll take you out anyway. 
 Kate was obsessed with finding beth. 
 She collected every piece of documentation  Having to do with the search,  Including logs of who searched where. 
 Now we just have to find them. 
 Ooh! 
 I do not think I was supposed to see this. 
 Oh, my god! 
 Thank you. 
 This is mine. 
 Please don't tell me kate was borrowing those. 
 No. 
 I've just kind of started moving in. 
 Wait. 
 You went from the 56th floor  Of a riverside penthouse to a loft  Above a loud gay bar? 
 A gay bar that I now run. 
 Figured it would save me the commute. 
 Bingo. 
 I get it. 
 You move into her place,  You take over her bar. 
 If I lost my sister, I'd want to hang on  To every piece of her, too. 
 You know, speaking of shorter commutes to work,  You should totally live here. 
 -With you? 
 -I'm serious. 
 I mean, it's already paid for. 
 There's an extra bedroom. 
 The bathroom is huge,  And no offense, your plant was looking kind of sad in your van. 
 This has corner sunlight, and there's a cute--  You don't have to sell my ass on moving  Out of my van. 
 Yes, I'd love to live here. 
 -Ok. 
 -Good. 
 Kate collected all of this as a kid? 
 Yeah. 
 The gcpd stopped looking for beth. 
 Search parties stopped looking for beth. 
 Eventually, even our dad  Stopped looking for her,  But kate never did. 
 She reminds me of someone. 
 Hmm? 
 My ex. 
 She never stopped looking for me either. 
 No. 
 She got you, too? 
 That's what she thinks. 
 Told you I got your back. 
 Ryan: she allowed herself to get caught  To help break me out. 
 It was the first time I remember ever feeling like  I actually mattered to someone. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, if angelique was there,  Then maybe she remembers where the house is. 
 -You got to call her. 
 -No, no, no, no, no. 
 I can't. 
 Things took a turn. 
 We don't even speak anymore. 
 Listen. 
 As a person with season tickets  To crazy lesbian drama, I can appreciate that,  But on behalf of kevin johnson,  You got to make an exception. 
 Mmm. 
 See? 
 Took a turn. 
 Must have changed her number. 
 Wait, wait. 
 Maybe this will help. 
 Point rock,  Gotham hope search group,  Gotham u's youth volunteers. 
 According to this, on saturday, october 1,  They went door to door. 
 This is a map of their route. 
 This must be where the candy lady lives. 
 -Yeah. 
 -I'm coming for you, kevin. 
 Wait. 
 Aren't you gonna suit up? 
 No. 
 She needs to see my face. 
 Well, how can I help? 
 You can clear out my bedroom,  Which you're currently using as your walk-in closet. 
 I need to do this alone. 
 Go get kevin back...roomie! 
 Alice, put the gun down. 
 Sorry, soph, but threesomes aren't my thing,  Especially when 1/3 worked with kate  To lock me in at arkham. 
 He can help us. 
 Us? 
 Are you not being held hostage right now? 
 What the hell is happening? 
 
 
 
 Oh. 
 Soph and I have been tasked by safiyah  To find a man, and once we do and I kill him,  We get kate back. 
 Wait. 
 What? 
 You never said anything about killing him. 
 Heh. 
 Didn't i? 
 Well, this one comes with special instructions. 
 Abracadabra. 
 I kill him with this. 
 [Cell phone vibrating] 
 Don't even think about it. 
 There's been 100 tips since the announcement,  But the one on wayside sounds half legit. 
 I'll swing by, check it out, let you know what I find. 
 Never touch my gun again. 
 So should I stay, or... 
 We can use your help. 
 [Door opens] 
 Can I help you, sweetie? 
 I'm here to claim kevin johnson. 
 Who? 
 15, Male, african-american,  Last seen...with you. 
 And who might you be? 
 Someone who cares. 
 I have seen him,  And he's found a family who loves him. 
 [Gagging] 
 Get her inside. 
 How exactly am I supposed to find a guy  With no last name on a laptop? 
 Do you have anything with actual calories in here? 
 There's rat poison under the sink. 
 Look. 
 I appreciate that the crows  Can get past most encryption fields,  But that doesn't do us any favors here. 
 This island must have the most advanced tech in the world  Because it's not showing up on any satellites. 
 You can see for yourself. 
 It's a dead end. 
 Wait. 
 What is... 
 Any chance there's something at wayne with more firepower? 
 100%. 
 Let me do a deep dive,  And I'll see what I can find. 
 Behold the only carbs in this hellhole. 
 Baguette? 
 I'm good. 
 Then I guess we wait. 
 Tell me you recorded "90 day fiance."  I'm gonna find your dad and see if his lead  Amounted to anything. 
 If you want to avoid being arrested,  I'd stay put. 
 Can you pick me up a 6-pack when you're out? 
 Young ryan: I can't believe you let yourself get caught. 
 I heard about this lady creeping  Around galaxy hero comics,  So I went there and made sure she saw me. 
 Why didn't anyone come for me? 
 Everyone thought you ran away,  But I knew you'd never leave your "ghost kid" collection behind. 
 Ha ha ha! 
 [Rubber band stretching] 
 Ohh! 
 Agh! 
 No! 
 [Coughing] 
 This is exactly why nobody wants you. 
 Ohh! 
 Come on, ryan. 
 We got to go before she wakes. 
 Ryan! 
 Ryan, you got to fight this. 
 Ryan, fight! 
 Fight like ghost kid would fight. 
 Remember when he lost his lame-ass invisibility  And everyone kept throwing crap at him  But he kept fighting anyway? 
 Ryan, get up! 
 You read "ghost kid"? 
 Unh. 
 [Grunting] 
 Ok. 
 [Thud] 
 Unh. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 Ooh! 
 Ok. 
 Ok, ok. 
 Come on. 
 Oh. 
 Right there. 
 Mmm. 
 Ahh. 
 [Glass crunches] 
 Huh! 
 Ahh! 
 Aah! 
 Ugh! 
 You don't remember me, huh, bitch? 
 Huh! 
 I'm the girl you couldn't break! 
 Unh! 
 Where is kevin? 
 Kevin ran out of jelly beans. 
 Who did you sell him to? 
 No one ever really knew his face,  And now that it's hidden behind a mask--  Ha ha ha! 
 No one ever will. 
 Ha ha ha! 
 Unh! 
 -You rudy? 
 -Kane, right? 
 What do you know? 
 Like I said on the phone, before the plane took off,  I was working the tarmac as a marshal,  You know, the guy with the orange batons--  Yeah. 
 I know what--what that is. 
 So right before the plane takes off,  I notice a suspicious suv pull up to the aircraft,  And I'm thinking to myself, "what the hell's going on?"  Because only catering and emergency vehicles  Are allowed that far out. 
 Agh! 
 Heh. 
 Damn, kevin. 
 You smooth. 
 Now...let's go and earn you your mask. 
 I'm here. 
 What makes you think ocean is? 
 Luke: because while you and alice were bickering  Over what temp to keep your thermostat,  I was texting the only person we know who knows safiyah. 
 -Julia? 
 -Yeah. 
 Turns out julia had heard ocean left the island a few years back,  So she went looking for him herself,  Hoping to get more intel on safiyah. 
 So where's he? 
 Well, she was waylaid, but she did narrow down  His hideout to 4 possible locations. 
 It looks like two were demolished,  One is now an ice cream parlor, and--  I'm sitting in front of the fourth. 
 -Be careful. 
 -Copy that. 
 Woman: you break it, you bought it. 
 Unh! 
 Ohh! 
 Agh! 
 [Both grunting] 
 Do I know you? 
 Unh! 
 If you did, you would have seen that coming. 
 Alice: let her go. 
 Where's ocean? 
 Who? 
 Look. 
 I just came here looking to bag the place,  And clearly, it's not worth it,  So you two can have it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. 
 Just when I thought we were bonding. 
 Did you really think I'd trust you? 
 I want to find kate just like you. 
 The question is why? 
 To make things right, to apologize,  To promise you'll change your ways? 
 I think we both know the answer to that question. 
 I'm gonna find my sister,  And I'm gonna kill her. 
 Yo, kevin. 
 Candy lady says you're ripe. 
 Prove it. 
 Kill a crow. 
 But he didn't do nothing. 
 He's not on trial. 
 You are. 
 You want to be in the family, right? 
 Prove it. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 You know, I do have a legit tip for you, commander. 
 Don't come down to false face society's hood solo. 
 [Whoosh] 
 He didn't. 
 Woman: ♪ I'm not gonna shed a tear, baby ♪  ♪ You can watch me move ♪  And that's for making me sweat out my edges. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Kevin, no, no, no. 
 What are you doing? 
 I want a family, and they want me. 
 Kid, put the gun down. 
 Kevin, listen to me. 
 You do this, and you throw your entire life away. 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 Kevin--hey. 
 Wait. 
 I do, though. 
 I know you have a brother. 
 I know that you think no one cares about you,  And I know that if you pull that trigger  You'll become exactly what the candy lady says you are--  Invisible. 
 How do you know so much about me? 
 Because I set out to find you,  Because you matter. 
 I see you,  And you are meant for so much more than this. 
 Protect him. 
 This is a false face society hot spot. 
 There's bound to be more creeping. 
 How'd you know he was here? 
 Easy. 
 I looked. 
 Dewitt: candice long, aka the candy lady,  Was captured tonight after batwoman uncovered  A 20-year conspiracy involving the false face society  And child trafficking. 
 This street-to-gang pipeline includes kevin johnson,  Who credits both batwoman and crows commander jacob kane  For his rescue earlier tonight,  Which begs the obvious question--  Is there a bat-crow partnership on the horizon? 
 At least one of us did something right today. 
 Half right. 
 You know, I never thought I'd say this,  But if batwoman hadn't been there,  I probably wouldn't be here. 
 What happened? 
 Alice happened, sir. 
 She wants to find kate,  And it's imperative that we find her first. 
 I'm totally stealing this jacket fyi. 
 So you're already raiding my closet. 
 Duh! 
 Ha! 
 [Sighs] 
 [Ag and nilu's "found a home" playing] 
 She never stopped looking,  Even when all the evidence said that she was crazy. 
 You know, I can live in her place  And take over her bar  And hold on to all the little pieces of her,  But none of it will bring me closure  If I don't actually look. 
 I don't want to believe alice,  But i--i don't want to believe that kate's dead either. 
 Then maybe it's time we start thinking a little crazy. 
 Yeah. 
 [Cell phone buzzes] 
 -Hey. 
 I got to go. 
 -Everything ok? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll let you know. 
 Nilu: ♪ alone ♪  ♪ Where every word is true ♪  ♪ And you ♪  ♪ My feet have traveled far ♪  ♪ My arms have been... ♪  Look who might have found the key to the ocean. 
 Nilu: ♪ outstretched ♪  ♪ I was looking for something I hadn't seen yet ♪  [Gasps] 
 [Men grunting] 
 Safiyah: ocean. 
 Nilu: ♪ and now I don't have so far... ♪  Hi. 
 Hi. 
 [Exhales]
