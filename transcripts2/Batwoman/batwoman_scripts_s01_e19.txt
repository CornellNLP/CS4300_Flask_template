 Previously on "Batwoman"... 
 What's so special about Lucius Fox's journal? 
 It's a failsafe to kill the Bat. 
 No! 
 We can make you into anyone you want to be. 
 When do... I get my face? 
 As soon as I get that journal. 
 Kate? 
 Reagan? 
 What do you mean it's gone? 
 I woke up, and Reagan was gone, and... and so was the book. 
 The book filled with secrets my dad died to protect? 
 I never thought that Reagan... 
 Guys, the million dollar question is what would a bloody bartender want with it? 
 You got your book. You can trade it for your freedom, but I'm done being advance scout for Magpie. 
 How's my new favorite book? 
 Lucius Fox wrote the entire journal in code! 
 What? No. Errr! 
 Wait. Please don't... 
 Oh, my God! 
 What the hell? 
 Hush. 
 Unh! 
 Oh... my God! 
 I double-locked that. Where's the journal? 
 How did you even find me? 
 You don't get to ask questions, Reagan. 
 No more B.S. 
 Tell me where the journal is, and I will get out of your life. 
 It wasn't all B.S., Kate. 
 Sorry. I must have misinterpreted the part where you slept with me so you could steal my property. 
 Yes, I stole it, and, yes, I slept with you, but it wasn't all... 
 I still... 
 I totally get why you hate me. 
 Where's the journal? I don't know, and that's the truth. I... 
 I gave it to someone. 
 Who? 
 It will sound worse than it is. 
 Who do you work for? 
 It's more like with. 
 My sister Margot. 
 You know her... as Magpie. 
 Magpie is your sister? 
 Surprise. 
 Why did she want it? 
 It bought her her freedom out of Arkham. 
 Who did she give it to? I don't know. 
 I don't ask for details for exactly this reason. 
 Besides, by now, it's lost up the food chain, she's in the wind. 
 I told all this to your friend. 
 What? What friend? 
 Blond chick with the British accent. 
 She cornered me in a parking lot, put a knife to my throat, didn't stop to give a name. 
 Good evening, Janet. 
 I heard you had quite the encounter with Abraham earlier. 
 Well, they don't call it the mess hall for nothing, Dr. Butler. 
 Ha ha! Indeed. 
 That was the wrong answer, Professor Carr. 
 Try again. 
 Is he done yet? 
 Does he look done yet? 
 I think this numeral is Aramaic. 
 This is Mayan. 
 These two letters could be Babylonian. 
 I mean, if you want Kate dead so badly, why don't you just shoot her? 
 I'm sure Tommy will give you the friends and family rate. 
 So the last thing she sees is his gauze pad and his gun and has no idea what's happening? 
 No. Her betrayal deserves a reckoning. 
 You see this, douchewad? 
 Not exactly the lady killer I used to be before that looney tune decided to hold my new face hostage till you figure out what the hell this book says, so glue a few brain cells together and think on it! 
 This is extraordinarily complex. 
 My expertise is actually numerical analysis, iterative... please, please! 
 Just let me go! 
 I won't tell anyone I was here! Please. 
 Alice, Alice, stop, stop! 
 Alice, stop! Stop! 
 Agh! 
 Oopsie. 
 Looks like Professor Carr ran out of gas. 
 Yeah, but you didn't even give him a chance. 
 Can we move on to my plan now? 
 No. We can't bring Luke Fox into this. 
 His father designed the code. 
 It doesn't take a cryptologist to puzzle together that he's our best choice. 
 If we kidnap the kid, we draw out the Bat. 
 It's already dangerous enough bringing in these other people. 
 We found our Wonderland... hot showers, comfortable beds, 3 meals a day, and we get to be together. 
 If we draw her out, we could lose everything. 
 Tommy said that this book holds the key to killing Batwoman, and I want her very, very dead. 
 Having said that... 
 I hate to see you fret. 
 He's number one. 
 You have two strikes left. 
 Now put on your Dr. Butler face and escort Tommy out the door. 
 Good morning, Gotham, or should I say... 
 Good morning, Gotham? 
 After a showdown in G.U.'s library last night, the GCPD have coined the bandage-wrapped gunslinger after the only word witnesses heard him utter... "Hush". 
 Welcome to Gotham City, Hush. 
 Sounds like you're gonna fit right in. 
 What, you, uh, didn't think I'd find her? 
 Sorry, luv. You caught me before my latte. 
 Reagan said you came looking for the journal. 
 Right. I did. 
 Well, considering her little Dine and Dash, I figured I'd spare you the humiliation. 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 Why did you want it? For you. 
 You held a knife to her throat. 
 Oh, please tell me you're not defending the woman who lured you into bed to pluck a book out from underneath your pillow. 
 Why didn't you just use your name, tell her you're with The Crows? 
 I see. Reagan can't be trusted, and now no one can be trusted. 
 Not no one, just people who have lied to me in the past, and last time I checked, that includes you. 
 Thanks. 
 Kate, hey. Didn't expect to see you here. 
 She was just leaving. 
 Commander called a briefing. We should go. 
 Approximately 20 minutes ago, one of our clients was kidnapped. 
 Tony Kim, 45, undercover NSA agent. 
 He was taken while reporting for work at the field office at Tricorner Yards. 
 In searching the area, their security also discovered last night's kidnapping victim Professor John Carr dead in a dumpster. 
 Based on CCTV footage at Tricorner, we can confirm Kim was abducted by the same faceless perp that took Carr from the university, and apparently, the press has already given him a nickname... 
 Hush. 
 Let's find agent Kim and snuff this homicidal b*st*rd out. 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 Why would Julia want the book for herself? 
 I don't know. Why is Julia suddenly back in town, working for my dad, dating my ex? 
 She's not scheming against us. And you'd know that how? 
 Because she pretended to fall in love with you when she was really just a babysitter sent by Bruce Wayne? 
 Okay. It's time to day drink. 
 Because I've known her since we were kids. 
 She's legit. So you believe her over me? 
 Am I not allowed to disagree with you now? 
 Not when we're both being lied to. 
 I trust her, Kate. 
 Then I can't trust your judgment. 
 Says the girl who went home with the bartender and left the key to destroying Gotham on the nightstand. 
 Damn. If you don't like how I do things, no one's forcing you to be here. 
 You know what? You are absolutely right. 
 I have to find this damn book. 
 Which would be easier with Luke. 
 Because computers and stuff. 
 Okay. I got to... um... mmm. 
 Gotham safety alert. 
 There's been another kidnapping. 
 They think it's the same guy who hit up G.U.'s library last night. 
 NSA data analyst. 
 NSA? Wait. Hang on. 
 In college, one of my friends had Professor Carr at least until he had to have an emergency heart surgery, and then apparently, they got, like, the hottest sub to replace him, and the class became standing room... 
 Mary. Only. Sorry. 
 Right. I think... 
 Yep. Dr. Carr taught cryptography I and II. 
 Codes just like the NSA. 
 Okay. Reagan said the journal looked like it was written in hundreds of different languages like a cipher. 
 So you think this Hush guy is kidnapping codebreakers because he has the journal? 
 Yeah, and if he gets someone to break the code before I find him... then the same monster who shot up a library full of people will know all about the deadliest weapons in Gotham. 
 Agent Kim, hi. 
 I was hoping to employ your services. 
 Hmm? 
 And to think, he was hired to protect our country. 
 They need more than 90 minutes to figure it out. 
 Alice, you keep killing them. 
 Well, they keep disappointing me. 
 You realize the more people we abduct, the more we risk exposure. 
 And you realize none of this is real, right? 
 You can play house and dress-up and pretend this funny farm is your own private castle, but at the end of the day, you're just a freak who made out with a radiator. 
 Enough! 
 Boys... 
 You'll just have to find me someone else. 
 Every codebreaker in the city is on lockdown because of him! 
 Well, there is one codebreaker no one knows about. 
 Ha ha! You are such a dork. 
 You know, my mom is now obsessed with that show thanks to you. 
 As she should be because she understands cultural relevancy. 
 My mom thinks culture is spaghetti with... 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hush. 
 Parker, what's up? 
 According to the "Gazette", Carr's body was found covered in burn marks. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means poor Professor Carr. 
 Like he hadn't been through enough. 
 Right. You said he had heart surgery. 
 Mm-hmm. Any chance that surgery involved getting a pacemaker? 
 Hmm. Because a pacemaker is totally traceable. 
 Exactly. 
 So we trace it back to where it transmitted its last signal, and then we'll know where he died, and then we'll find hush. That's genius. 
 Mm-hmm. Right. 
 Let's do it. Okay. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Right. So trace it. 
 How? You don't know? 
 Kind of a Luke thing. 
 Maybe it's time to apologize. 
 Wait. Me? Mm-hmm. 
 You have a land line? 
 Gotham Pride Real Estate. 
 Is Kate Kane there? 
 Who is this? My name's Gina. 
 I'm Parker Torres's girlfriend, and she said she knew you. 
 Okay. Yep. Hi. So I don't know what happened, but we were Facetiming, and then the phone started shaking, and then she screamed to call you, but then it went dead, and the last place she showed up on find my friends was in Somerset, and now I'm freaking out. 
 Who is Parker Torres? 
 So if you're scared to show your face in Gotham, that's bad. 
 Like, what's under there? 
 Shut up! 
 Aren't you supposed to say, "Hush"? 
 Shut up! 
 No offense, but I've been kidnapped by worse, and I know if you haven't killed me yet, it means you can't kill me. 
 Err. Ahh. 
 Kate, this is Mary. Oop. Wait. 
 Are we allowed to use our real names? 
 It doesn't matter. I'm in Somerset. 
 Okay. There's a Van going south on the Williams Viaduct. 
 It just triggered 3 speed trap cams. 
 Probably him. I'm heading north. 
 I... don't know if that's a good idea. 
 Let me zoom in real quick. 
 God. How do you... Ohh. Is there a manual? 
 Ohh. 
 Uh, okay. Hello? Can you still hear me? 
 I think you're driving the wrong way on a one-way. 
 Kate, you're going the wrong way. 
 Batwoman. 
 Well, Batty wants to be a hood ornament. 
 Unh! 
 Come on. 
 Hey! 
 Oh. Hello, Parker. 
 Welcome. Thank you for joining us. 
 "I'm a teen. I have angst". 
 We get it, Alice. 
 Do you? 
 Because you couldn't handle a teenage school girl. 
 Well, Batwoman showed, I had to bail. 
 What do you mean Batwoman showed? 
 Were you followed? 
 Well, I sort of stopped thinking clearly when she threw a batarang in my leg! 
 Boys, boys, all the more reason to want her dead. Ha! 
 Now I have met disappointment thrice. 
 Are we finally ready to do things my way, hmm? 
 Got to jet. We got a possible Hush sighting on the Williams Viaduct. 
 Got it. 
 Uh, you go ahead. I'll meet up. 
 Copy. 
 Hey, you. I love visitors and all, but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to be here. 
 That's funny because I did a little digging, Julia, and I'm pretty sure I can say the same thing about you. 
 OMG! Full disclosure, I thought Batcave was a metaphor. 
 Are there, like... Aah! 
 Yep. Not a metaphor. 
 Uh, hi. I think you got off at the wrong floor. 
 It's fine. This is Parker Torres. 
 Hmm. K.K. and I go way back, and you're... 
 Mary, otherwise known as the last person to find out that Kate is Batwoman. 
 Hush got away. 
 What do you mean Hush got away? 
 He was our only lead since you refuse to ask Luke how to track a pacemaker. 
 I'm well aware. Thank you. 
 Maybe you should kiss and make up and get his butt back here. 
 Who are you? 
 And then SRR found out I was doing a spot of freelancing for another party, and, well, they let me go. 
 No. A spot of freelancing doesn't get you blacklisted from the biggest intelligence agency in the EU. 
 Who are you working for? 
 Who wants my dad's journal? 
 Luke, if I told you that, we wouldn't be sitting here right now. 
 _ 
 Hello. Hey. Where are you? 
 Wilson Plaza by Crows headquarters. 
 What... what phone are you using? 
 Stay there. I'll find you. 
 Okay. 
 Kate's on her way down, so are you gonna tell her, or am I? 
 Ballistics matched these rounds to the library crime scene. 
 Same 45-caliber pistol. 
 It was Hush. And he wasn't alone. 
 We're lucky there wasn't much traffic on that bridge, or we'd be bagging a lot more than batarangs. 
 Sir... I don't want to fight with you about Batwoman's intentions. 
 My fight's not with you, but I also don't want to wait around to find out which masked freak is gonna get more people killed. 
 I'm bloody serious, Luke. 
 Kate can't know any of this. 
 I blew up on Kate this morning in your defense, and she was right about everything. 
 Not everything, okay? 
 There's stuff about Kate you don't know. 
 _ 
 Are you here already? 
 What are you talking about? 
 What do you mean what am I tal... 
 Hush. 
 Unh! 
 Welcome to Arkham. 
 You're going to decipher Daddy's code, or we will fry this little cutie... like bacon. 
 There's no way. My dad was a genius legitimately... Mensa, 163 IQ. 
 It would take a team a codebreakers weeks, months to crack this. 
 Well... sadly, I don't think he's gonna give you that long. 
 Hey, it's Luke. 
 Now he's not answering. Can you text him? 
 I am. It's green. 
 I think his phone is off. 
 Something's up. He might be mad at me, but he wouldn't turn off his phone. 
 Wait. Is that him? 
 No. It's Sophie in the elevator. 
 Should I invite her down here since apparently everyone else is allowed? 
 Good talk. 
 Hmm. 
 Sophie, hey. 
 You okay? 
 Honestly, trying to rein in a little panic. 
 Not to make this awkward or... whatever, but have you seen Julia? 
 She's M.I.A. 
 Who's the babe? 
 Way off limits. It's Kate's ex. 
 Of course she is, and who's Julia? 
 Uh... 
 Her other ex. 
 Okay. Move! 
 I heard you two were hanging out. 
 Julia and me? 
 I... I guess you could say that. 
 Is that... okay? 
 No, it's not okay. Oh, this is torture. 
 Because if it's not, I'll keep it platonic. 
 Whatever makes you happy. 
 No! Tell her you love her! 
 Oh, shh. I can't hear. 
 If I hear from Julia, I'll tell her to check in. 
 Would you ask Luke, too? 
 He was with her before she went radio silent. 
 Luke? 
 Stop! Stop! Stop! 
 Stop! You're killing her! 
 Ugh! 
 Nope. Not yet. Still alive for now. 
 Aw. You are a tough one, lass. 
 Arkham's power bills are gonna be through the roof, but just between me, you, and... well, science, I'm not sure how much more you can take. 
 I've had worse. 
 Not yet, but you will if the human abacus over here doesn't show me how the cipher works. 
 How do you expect me to concentrate? 
 You want me to figure this out, give me some space. 
 Indeed. Oh, and show me your work, Mr. Fox, because if you're lying, I am going to turn blondie into a glow stick. Heh. 
 You can do this, right? 
 I don't know. Uh, I need more brain power, I need... I need more time. 
 I need... I need my dad. 
 Luke, you are every bit as smart as your father. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Okay. I more than anybody wish like hell that were true, but I am not my father, okay? 
 I'm not even close. 
 And we're both going to die because of it. 
 I don't understand why we're keeping Tommy alive. 
 Because he spent the last decade looking for ways to kill Batman. 
 He managed to steal the Rail Gun from Wayne R&D before my sister pilfered it. 
 Maybe he'll know where we can find whatever weapon we glean from this journal, and then we'll kill him. 
 Heh heh. Off to group therapy. 
 Mr. Calderon is right on the verge of a real breakthrough. 
 Ooh. Go get them, doc! 
 Heh heh heh. 
 Of course Hush took Luke. His dad wrote the journals. 
 Anything? 
 I can't get a ping on either of their phones. 
 Okay. What about running a trace on Professor Carr's pacemaker? 
 Yeah, maybe, but not from this. 
 What about that? 
 That looks older than my mom. 
 Sure you don't have anything more modern like a sundial? 
 Sorry. Why does this rando teen get to know you're Batwoman? 
 Let me see what I can do. Ooh. 
 Julia... 
 It's a polyalphabetic cipher. 
 Okay. That's a start. 
 How many letters are in it? 
 Hundreds. 
 Hundreds in multiple languages and alphabets. 
 Well, can you work out the sequence? 
 So far, I got "A" corresponds with Heth, the first letter of the Aramaic alphabet, which is alphabetically the first of the other alphabets my dad used. 
 "B" takes us to the Babylonian alphabet, the next alphabetically. 
 That's bloody brilliant. 
 Can't you slide one letter at a time? 
 
 
 
 No. I tried that. 
 That would be way too easy for my dad. 
 There's an interval variance each time he switches to a new alphabet. 
 Now if I could figure out the... the number sequence for the intervals, then I'd have the key to decrypt this. 
 That leaves us 10 minutes to work out a few billion random number sequences. 
 Except my dad was meticulous. 
 It would never be random. 
 It'd be personal to him. 
 Or personal to me. 
 Okay. The first slides 5, the second slides 3, the third 5. 
 He used my social security number. 
 Okay. No pressure, but... 
 That's what people say when they're pressuring someone. 
 It's just that we're running out of time. 
 I'm in. Manufacturer's database says there are 3 John Carrs with pacemakers. 
 Do you have their locations? Not yet, but if I'm not careful, I could kill the two John Carrs that aren't already dead, so, yeah, no pressure. 
 Anything I can do to help? 
 Can you bypass the data throttle and get me more speed out of this heap? 
 Nope. 
 Then I'll settle for you not distracting me. 
 Aw. How cute was baby Luke? Ha! 
 Hey, Mr. Fox, your frames are on point. 
 Glasses. It's the glasses. 
 They can translate the journals. Try. 
 The journals need these to decode them. 
 Ah. You did it? Ah! Didn't you? 
 You know what it says? 
 Yeah. Ha! 
 Why aren't you happier about this? 
 You did it! 
 What does it say? 
 Something that I can't tell anyone, most of all Gotham's least mentally stable villain. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Time's up. Pencils down now. 
 Read to me from my new favorite bedtime story. 
 We're not telling you. 
 Does she speak for both of you, or... 
 My father was willing to die for this secret, and we're willing to do the same. 
 Okay. Two of the John Carr pacemakers are still active, and the third stopped working here. 
 Professor Carr's heart beat for the last time at... 
 No. Is that Arkham? 
 Alice is behind this somehow. 
 Reagan stole the journal to get Magpie out of Arkham. 
 That's who she bought her freedom for. 
 Not to state the obvious, but Alice is an inmate. 
 She's also Alice, and being captive is a way of life for her. 
 You know how Carr had burn marks on his body? 
 Yeah. 
 I think I know how she's torturing her victims. 
 How? 
 Oh, she usually doesn't tell us what she's thinking. 
 So cool. 
 Hey. Stop right there! 
 Hey. What the hell are you doing? 
 Sorry, guys. I didn't want to do that. 
 Like hot having the right tool. 
 Can I get an amen? 
 That's right, and when it comes to drill bits, I'm... 
 Delta 1566, give me a call... 
 Batwoman just took down a pair of guards at Arkham. 
 We're still rounding up the perps from the last breakout. 
 I want all available teams getting a handle on this now! 
 I can do this all day. 
 Oh, she's so strong. 
 Ooh! Toasty! 
 Now tell me what Daddy had to say. 
 Do you not get it, Alice? 
 You're the reason there's a code in the first place. 
 And you're the reason Alfie Pennyworth has to go... casket shopping. 
 Let them go. 
 I'm sorry. Who are you? 
 All the torture therapy I've endured here has messed with the old noggin. 
 I said let them go. 
 Aw. Batty, you're outnumbered, and sadly, we don't do demands. 
 I'm not demanding. I'm trading. 
 These are Lucius Fox's glasses. 
 They unlock the code. 
 No. 
 Let Luke and Julia go, and they're yours. 
 You cannot do this. 
 If I don't, she will kill you. 
 And she'll kill you! 
 The book doesn't contain Batweapon designs. 
 It contains the secret to killing you. 
 My offer stands. 
 Let them go. 
 Take these stairs to the bottom. 
 You'll find a hatch in the floor that leads to the tunnels. 
 Get her out of here. Where are you going? 
 To stop Alice and get the book back. 
 Hey! 
 Batwoman's in cell block "D". 
 What did they do now? 
 Oh, we got to get out of this place. 
 Our cover's blown. 
 Get the van. Pull to the side lot by the air vents. 
 We'll find you. 
 Alice, you got to get back to your cell now. 
 Uh... what are you doing? 
 No. No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 It was all very well and good while it lasted, my dear Mouse. 
 Please don't. 
 Come on. We're headed to the main room. 
 Aah! Unh! 
 Ha ha ha! Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeahhh! 
 Aah! 
 No! Alice! Help me! 
 This doesn't matter. It does matter. 
 We've built a life for us here. 
 It's over, Mouse. 
 We've been exposed. 
 Oh! 
 No! 
 Let's go! Tunnels now! 
 Get out now! 
 Sir, we were too late. 
 It's World War III in there. 
 Lock it all down and find me the Bat. 
 Hey. 
 I thought you went home. 
 Let me just say something real quick. 
 You messed up today, okay? 
 I'm not worth the death of Batwoman. 
 I'm not worth seeing hundreds upon thousands of citizens lose hope as a result of whatever insane plan Alice is formulating. 
 I am not worth all the lives that could have... 
 We both know there's no Batwoman without Luke Fox 
 I was lost without you today. 
 Good. 
 Sorry. Hi. 
 Um, I'm... where... wh... 
 Uh... I'm gonna go. 
 Thank you for your help today. 
 Not that you're gonna take advice from a rando teen, but... Sophie. 
 Maybe fight a little harder? 
 We'll see. 
 I was gone for 5 hours. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 What's the damage? 
 Oh. Well, my left hand's numb, some nerve damage in my arm. 
 The medic thinks I'll heal eventually. 
 Or sooner. 
 I'm glad you're okay. 
 Me, too. 
 Kate. 
 Looks like a bad time. 
 Hey. I'm gonna go. 
 Luke told me everything. 
 He couldn't have told you everything because he doesn't know everything. 
 I know you're lying about why you're after a book that describes how to kill me. 
 The Rifle showed up in Gotham to assassinate you several months ago. 
 I helped thwart him, and he disappeared. 
 You ever wonder why he never came back? 
 Because I followed him to his boss and made a deal with her to stop pursuing you. 
 In exchange for your life, I'd fetch her the journal, and we'd both be on our merry way. 
 If she had the journal, she could still kill me. 
 She played me. 
 I didn't know what the journal entailed till today. 
 Now that I do, the deal's off. 
 Who is she? 
 Safiyah Sohail. 
 I've never heard of her. 
 Well, she's heard of you, luv, and now that I've double-crossed her, we've both got targets on our backs. 
 How's Arkham? 
 It's a mess. 
 Psychotic escapees are all over this city right now thanks to you. 
 Thanks to Alice. 
 She had the entire asylum under... 
 Alice isn't the one claiming to be the city's hero. 
 She needs you as much as you need her. 
 The Joker had Batman like she has you, and guess who always ends up as collateral damage. 
 I will protect my city. 
 No, you won't because you're done. 
 Get out. 
 You know I won't leave. 
 Let this serve as your warning. 
 If I see you again, it's war. 
 This isn't a shelter, Alice. 
 This is... back to where we started. 
 No one's forcing you to stay. 
 I told you that inviting Luke into your obsession would draw out the Bat, and now here we are, freezing, wet, drenched in sewer water. 
 And I told you that Luke would bring us the answers that we need, so I suppose we're both right. 
 I was happy, Alice. I was happy. 
 What happened to you? 
 Do you even care that you burnt the whole thing down? 
 I care about killing the Bat, so go bring me that walking facial gone wrong so he can tell me where to find a little green rock called Kryptonite. 
 Greg, move your head.
