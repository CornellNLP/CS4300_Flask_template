 Oh, you think you're good, huh? 
 Who's your daddy? Unh! That's right! Me! 
 Come on. Err! Come to Daddy. 
 Yes! 
 Ahh. Finally. 
 Hey. Is there any more wine? 
 LIZA ANNE: ♪ Oh, I'm just tired ♪ 
 ♪ Tired of trying to hold... ♪ How did you beat him already? 
 I learned the secret sucker punch combo. 
 The secret sucker punch combo's a thing. 
 Yeah, which you would know about if you'd, like, ever beaten me, like, one time. 
 Okay. I'm sorry that I spent the best video gaming years of my life locked in a basement cell. 
 That's one way to take someone's head off. 
 She's giving me pointers on how to be evil. 
 WOMAN: ♪ 'Cause you're talking to me ♪ Nice building. 
 I thought you renovated the place. 
 I did... just badly apparently. 
 WOMAN: ♪ Maybe it's bitter, and I don't want to go down ♪ Is this really happening? 
 What? Us? 
 Bickering, drinking, playing video games. 
 Like actual sisters? 
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's happening. 
 Give me that. You suck. 
 I've had wine, so this will probably be overly sentimental, but... 
 Thank you for never giving up on me. 
 Hey. It's like I've always said. 
 You're worth it. 
 [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] 
 That's not a bad connection, is it? 
 No, it's not, but it was nice while it lasted. 
 No. 
 Stop. 
 Let me stay here. 
 Let me stay here! 
 [ECHOING] Here! 
 [GAGGING] 
 Let's try this again. 
 You live in a fantasy. 
 Fantasy is not reality. 
 This is your reality, Alice.

 [BOTH GRUNTING] 
 [HEART BEATING] 
 [CARTWRIGHT GROANS] 
 [GAGS] 
 Don't be dead, please. 
 [GRUNTING] 
 Come on! Live! 
 Wake up! Come on! Please. Wake up! 
 MAN: Up here! 
 LUKE, ON COMMS: Batwoman, you got company. 
 [HEART BEATING] 
 Talk to me, Batwoman. 
 Your heart rate's off the charts. 
 Kate, answer me. Are you okay? 
 - Kate? I'm fine. 
 _ 
 [BEEPING] 
 DISPATCHER: Charlie 34, what's your 20? 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 Uhh. 
 What the hell? 
 Ohh! Oh, no! No, no, no. 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 _ 
 DISTORTED VOICE: Officer Wilcox, you have a bomb strapped to your chest. 
 Don't worry. It's easy to disarm. 
 Simply push the yellow button, which will trigger a second bomb I've planted somewhere else in Gotham. 
 What? - That's right. 
 You disarm your bomb to save yourself, allowing countless others to die, or you die and save all those people you've never met, who will never know of your sacrifice. 
 So, my friend, are you a hero? 
 The choice should be easy, right? 
 A hero would do anything for his city. 
 Would you... 
 [GASPS] 
 [EXPLOSION] 
 VESPER: Now here's a blast from the past. 
 The Detonator is back after a 7-year hiatus, and he's out to prove there are no heroes left in Gotham. 
 Got to admit he made his point in dynamite when a GCPD officer blew up a bank last night to save his own tail without even letting the timer drop into the single digits. 
 Yikes! Talk to me, Gotham. Are you a hero? 
 Again? 
 You're the second one this week. What happened? 
 I was helping a guy out of the bomb wreckage, and the ceiling collapsed. 
 I'm gonna take a look at your ribs. 
 No. Don't cut it. No. Aw! 
 This thing took forever to make. 
 So insider tip. My scissors should not be able to cut through your supersuit. 
 Why are you pretending to be Batwoman? 
 Because the real one is M.I.A., and the city still has PTSD from when Batman left. 
 I thought maybe if people saw me and believed that she was still around that... hsssh! 
 Mm-hmm. I know. I'm an idiot. 
 Your heart is in the right place your ribs, however, are not. 
 Hey. You know people in the underground. 
 Do you know where she is? 
 Trust me. I'm the last person Batwoman would ever confide in. 
 I left you like this a week ago, and now it smells like this. 
 So you just let yourself into my home now? 
 Yeah, and I could have been anyone. 
 Ugh. I remember this vile concoction. 
 I don't call it a chimney sweep for nothing. 
 Cheers. 
 You haven't returned my texts, and while I'm decidedly not that girl, do we need to talk about what happened the other night? 
 Let's not turn this into a thing. 
 But... ahem... thank you for... 
 Being there for you? 
 No complaints from me, luv. 
 Gotham, on the other hand, feels right ghosted by their caped crusader. 
 What's going on? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Whenever I put that suit on, I... 
 I crossed a line when I killed Cartwright. 
 What if I screw up and kill someone else? 
 I see. You want to punish yourself. 
 Fine. You screwed up and took a man's life. 
 Bruce would be blustery with disappointment, and now you need to get over it. 
 That's your pep talk? Yeah. I'm needed elsewhere, and so are you. 
 Someone bombed Gotham International Bank last night, killed a dozen people. 
 Vacation's over, Batwoman. 
 MOUSE: My whole life my father urged me to hide my face, to live in the shadows. 
 He claimed it was for my own good to avoid ridicule, but it turns out it was for his own good. 
 I hid for his comfort, but the moment I realized I didn't care if he was comfortable or not, I became myself. 
 I became free. 
 [SOFTLY] What are you doing? 
 [SOFTLY] I'm unburdening myself. 
 Unburdening yourself? 
 We are trapped in yet another cage thanks to my traitorous sister. 
 It's not a cage. It's a sanctuary, one where your family can't hurt you, where Safiyah can't find you, where we have each other. 
 MOUSE: What else do you need? BUTLER: Alice. 
 Would you like to share? 
 We haven't heard from you yet. 
 I'm gonna pass, yeah. 
 TOMMY: Oh, I've got something to share. 
 ALICE: Oh, goody. It's Tommy Elliot. 
 TOMMY: Excuse me. Ah. 
 Bruce Wayne could speak over 40 languages. 
 That's 4... 4-0. 
 BUTLER: Mr. Elliot, this group started 15 minutes ago. 
 TOMMY: Okay. Well, so sue me. 
 Oh, that's right. You can't because my, uh... my estate's been frozen. 
 BUTLER: Mr. Elliot, I am thrilled that our therapy has converted your disdain for Mr. Wayne into a deeper appreciation, but we do need to move on to other topics. 
 What's wrong, doc? It's, like, too crazy? 
 Because that one thinks she's a cat. 
 That one thinks she's a myna bird. 
 MAGPIE: Magpie. The name is Magpie. 
 Steals people's faces. 
 I mean, this one drools so much the orderlies have to follow him around with a mop, and, you know, what about me? 
 [MOANING LOUDLY] What about me? I'm the guy that taught Bruce Wayne everything he knows, so where's my recognition, doc? 
 Get him out of here, please. 
 No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! 
 No! Bruce is my best friend, and when he hears about this, he will end your career! 
 Enjoy the power trip while it lasts! 
 [PEOPLE CRYING, MOANING, INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 I can't live like this. 
 [REPORTERS CLAMORING] 
 REEVES: My client Reggie Harris was wrongly incarcerated for years and then gunned down the same day he was freed. 
 Why? What did he know? 
 I will not rest until his family sees justice. 
 Excuse me. 
 REPORTER: Bobby, Bobby, one more question. 
 JULIA: Michael Fisher? Never heard of him. 
 Probably an alias, but he killed Alia Nazari and Reggie Harris, and he tried to kill me and my boss, all to keep some cover-up inside The Crows from getting out. 
 Which means we've got a juicy scandal on our hands. 
 Assuming we can figure out who he's working for. 
 This one's yours. Extra pickles. 
 Um, well, I'll look into his finances, see if anyone's paying him kill 4 people in 1 day money. 
 I already did. 
 A wire was sent to his account for 180 grand the day Reggie Harris was exonerated for Lucius Fox's murder. 
 Nicely done. 
 I'll go pester the bank manager then, figure out who sent it. 
 Which bank? Gotham International. 
 You're kidding. What? 
 Gotham International Bank is a pile of rubble along with its vault, its servers, backup servers. 
 Yeah. Some bloke cleverly named The Detonator bombed it last night. 
 Do you think he could be involved in this Crows cover-up? 
 No. I remember The Detonator. 
 He was active long before Reggie was convicted. 
 All right. Move over. 
 If we can't trace our sniper's paychecks, maybe we can figure out his real name. 
 [TYPING] 
 KATE: That's new. 
 Want to talk about it? Not especially. 
 Luke, the man you think killed your father, he was cleared and then shot in front of you. 
 Kind of think talking would be good. 
 Then let's talk. Why haven't you found anything on Cartwright yet? 
 I don't know. Maybe he's gone underground. 
 Well, while you've been away, ignoring all my texts, the Bat-light's gone unanswered. 
 Why do you think I'm here? 
 What do we know about The Detonator? 
 JACOB: 7 years ago, The Detonator crippled Gotham with fear and uncertainty. 
 He's a terrorist, who targets the city's good guys and compels them to kill innocents at random. 
 The question is why is he back now? 
 LUKE: You want an honest answer to that? 
 You, Batwoman. 
 When the Bat's away, the crazies will play. 
 I've only been out a week. 
 And in that week, the bad guys are getting comfortable. 
 JACOB: The Detonator targets people the public views as heroes... doctors, police officers, firemen. 
 He wants to prove that they're not as heroic as the world thinks they were. 
 KATE: Where'd you get these? 
 Bruce's research. 
 Yeah. He was obsessed with catching this guy. 
 Kept a long list of suspects, but the trail went cold before he could narrow it down. 
 JACOB: 214. The bomb that took out Gotham International Bank had these 3 numbers stamped into the ground plate. 
 This signature matches all 15 bombs detonated 7 years ago. 
 To be clear, this information was never released to the public, which eliminates the possibility of a copycat. 
 This is an original. That is our assertion, although we still don't know what 214 actually means. 
 KATE: Anyone on that suspect with military experience? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Yeah. A couple. 
 Who's George Adler? 
 Private black ops contractor. 
 He was fired for... 
 Yeah. That'll do it. 
 He was caught taking selfies with enemy corpses? 
 Adler was dishonorably discharged from military school back in the day. 
 No surprise there, but clearly that wasn't enough to implicate him in Bruce's mind. 
 Bruce didn't go to military school. 
 He wouldn't know the specific form number on discharge papers... DD-214. 
 I only know because Point Rock put the same code on my papers. 
 So the military deems you not good enough, and now that very thing is gonna save your city's ass. 
 I'm just gonna leave that little piece of irony right there. 
 I'll go talk to Adler. 
 Welcome back, Batwoman. 
 You should know your suit's nano tech is designed to withstand detonation overpressures of 10 pounds per square inch. 
 Gotham can be glad their hero's bomb-proof. 
 Now that kind of blast will knock off limbs and topple buildings... 
 [DISTORTED] But if you see any evidence of nuclear materials... 
 Uranium, anything marked isotope... 
 [NORMAL] Grapple the hell out of there. 
 I'm not suiting up. 
 I'm going as me. 
 Like a fledgling real estate developer? 
 I'm just gonna talk to him. 
 You haven't been out looking for Cartwright, have you? 
 Okay. Uh, look. The Bat team doesn't have an HR department, so as your co-worker and partner and pretty much only person you see on a regular basis, shouldn't I know what the hell is going on with you? 
 [SIGHS] 
 If I told you the truth, you would not want me to suit up either. 
 [TOMMY HUMMING] 
 Bruce Wayne wannabe. 
 I'm sorry. What did you just say? 
 Oh. Your boyfriend Bruce, yeah, he'd think you were a loser. 
 Hey. Knock it off. 
 Shh. Don't you ever say his name. 
 You will never be Bruce Wayne! 
 Aah! Unh! 
 [TOMMY GROANING] 
 Aah! I need a doctor! 
 [TOMMY GROANING] 
 Ha ha! 
 George Adler? 
 And you are? Kate Kane, Gotham Pride Real Estate. 
 I'm in the process of buying this building, and I have to photograph each of the units. 
 Yeah. You got paperwork or something? 
 My assistant will e-mail you. 
 _ 
 Really think he's back? 
 How the hell would I know? 
 Unh! 
 Ugh! What the hell? I thought you were in real estate. 
 Where'd you plant your next bomb? Who the hell are you? 
 Someone with an interest in Gotham's property values. 
 Let's just say your obsession with explosives isn't doing business any favors. 
 Hey. Look. The bombs, that wasn't me. 
 [GROANING] 
 I swear. It... it was my old man George Adler Sr. 
 Talk. 
 The first time he killed a guy, I don't know, it triggered something dark. 
 Look. I don't expect a billionaire developer to understand how taking a man's life screws with your head. 
 Try me. 
 He snapped, okay? 
 He wanted to show people that it's a lot harder to act like a hero when you're in the heat of it staring down your own death. 
 Where is he now? Gotham Cemetery. 
 What? 
 He's dead. Died 7 years ago. 
 [REEVES MOANING] 
 [BEEPING] 
 [GASPING] 
 No. No, no, no, no, no. Don't do this to me. 
 Ohh! 
 DISTORTED VOICE: The charismatic defense attorney who claims to stand up for the little guys, the every man. 
 What a hero. Now you have a choice. 
 Looking for me? 
 Are you okay? Yeah. 
 No thanks to security, so that's you. 
 They put Tommy in solitary. 
 Oh, good. Little does he know, the Bruce-obsessed neanderthal played his part to a t. 
 [MOANS] 
 I asked the nurse to be thorough. 
 Unh. Ow! 
 What are you... you're bleeding. 
 It's only temporary, Mouse. 
 Plus what's a little blood if it ensures our freedom? 
 REEVES: I can't do this. I have a family. 
 Well, you called us for a reason. 
 You know that lives depend on you staying calm and doing the right thing. Jacob, look. I'm no hero, okay? 
 You have to be one today. 
 It's down to 22 minutes. 
 Well, that's 22 minutes to get everyone cleared out of the area so you can push that button. 
 You just hang tight. 
 The Detonator wants his victims to hear the explosion they've caused. 
 That means the secondary explosive is likely within a one-mile radius of Bobby Reeves. 
 Bomb squad's on its way to Bobby. 
 Waste of time. This guy uses half a dozen tripwires. 
 If we want to save lives, we need to clear that mile in less than a half-hour. 
 Bobby, you still with me? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 The Detonator's dead. It's got to be a copycat. 
 You sure junior didn't pick up where his old man left off? 
 He was at work. Alibi checks out. 
 Crap! We're out of time, Kate. 
 The Detonator has another victim. 
 Crows and GCPD are clearing buildings now. 
 Ohh. Where is it? - Doesn't say, but they're clearing a mile from Wiget and Brighton. 
 Isn't that right by... - Mary. 
 Residents are to take only pets and leave everything else behind, follow authorities to the nearest checkpoint, and not to return under any circumstances until the threat has been neutralized. 
 We will continue to bring you live updates on this evacuation and bomb scare... 
 MARY: Go straight on Brighton for 6 blocks. 
 You'll hit a police barricade, and you'll be safe from there. Go. 
 Mr. Whittaker, we need to move you. 
 Get him to the checkpoint. 
 You need to come with. 
 Nobody knows this clinic exists. 
 They're gonna detonate that bomb whether this place is clear or not. 
 Come on. 
 I'm not leaving them. 
 Go! 
 [SIRENS] 
 Hey, Bobby. You're doing great. 
 You got to get this thing off me. 
 Oh, we will, we will. 
 We need to give our guys more time to clear the area. 
 I can't. I can't do it. I can't. 
 You're gonna do the right thing. 
 MAN, ON P.A.: On the order of Mayor Akins, all civilians are ordered to evacuate immediately. 
 Do not hesitate. Do not pack your belongings. 
 Humans and pets only. 
 If you can hear this message, evacuate now. 
 On the order of Mayor Akins, all civilians are ordered to evacuate. 
 WOMAN: Head straight to the checkpoint. 
 This is the last building on this block. 
 I promise you this is just a precaution like the fire drills you had as a kid. 
 What can I do? 
 Why did you come back? You need to get out of here. 
 These people need help. 
 Get everyone on the ground. 
 If they can't move, try and cover them with a mattress and pray this building passed its earthquake inspection. 
 Mary! 
 [TIMER BEEPING] 
 MAN: GCPD just gave the all clear. 
 Okay, Bobby. 
 [BEEPING STOPS] 
 [EXPLOSION] 
 Aah! 
 MAN, ON P.A.: Gotham is under a mandatory lockdown. 
 The streets are not safe. 
 Remain in your homes. 
 Gotham is under a mandatory lockdown. 
 The streets are not safe. 
 Remain in your homes. 
 [COUGHING] 
 Mary! 
 MARY: Aah! Ugh! 
 Help, please! 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [COUGHING] 
 Who is this? 
 MARY: Isn't it obvious? 
 She's Batwoman. 
 Uh, I... I have to go. 
 No! 
 [HEART BEATING] 
 You want to know why people like her exist and why they keep on showing up to spread hope? 
 It's because you inspired them, and now they feel abandoned. 
 What? What are you talking about? 
 Please, Kate. I know you're Batwoman. 
 I mean... 
 I just can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner... 
 But of course, Batwoman's the same girl who hunted down Derrick Peters and locked him in a urinal after he ditched me at homecoming, and of course, the maniac on the Batbike is the same maniac who taught me how to drive without actually having her license and totally charmed her way out of a ticket after my ass got us pulled over. 
 It couldn't be more obvious. 
 Batwoman is the same person I've looked up to my entire life, and now this city needs you as much as I do. 
 It's not that simple. 
 
 
 
 Uhh. It never is, but Batwoman doesn't get a sick day. 
 I'm not a hero, Mary. 
 I'm not asking you to be a hero. 
 I'm just asking you to keep going. 
 BUTLER: And how are we feeling today, Johnny? 
 I think I had another moment of clarity, Dr. Butler. 
 Really? And what was that? 
 Well, you know, I have almost everything that I want here. 
 Mm-hmm. Shelter, protection, my sister. 
 Hmm. And what is it you're still missing? 
 Power. 
 Huh! Unh! Ohh! 
 Feel that, Dr. Butler? 
 This is your reality now. 
 Unh! 
 [MOANS] 
 [THUD] 
 SOPHIE: Took a minute, but we figured out the real identity of the sniper who killed Reggie Harris. 
 He lived at 2420 Maple Street. 
 The same 2420 Maple Street that blew up? 
 Eviscerating all evidence linking him back to whoever hired him. Great. 
 In the last week alone, everyone with any knowledge of your father's real murderer has been killed. 
 We think The Detonator hired the sniper to kill Reggie Harris and used these bombs to cover his scent. Except The Detonator's dead. 
 We're dealing with a copycat. 
 The real Detonator died 7 years ago. 
 Which means that we're looking for someone who's intimately familiar with the Detonator's case. 
 Who'd have had access to the sealed reports 7 years ago? 
 Depends. Who was the investigating officer at the time? 
 Miguel Robles. He was a rookie cop on The Detonator investigation team. 
 Robles is head of the Crows homicide division. 
 Well, that's pretty high up in your bird's nest. 
 After Lucius was killed, The Crows paid Alia Nazari a 50 grand cleanup fee for the destruction of her Sip & Dash. 
 The Commander was worried it was a payoff to delete the surveillance footage, but Robles was convinced the payment wasn't out of the ordinary. 
 He was also the first to arrive at the Sip & Dash that night. 
 This guy's hands are in everything. 
 JACOB: I want every piece of shrapnel collected and tested for prints. 
 We'll find him before he strikes again. 
 Huh! 
 KATE, VOICE-OVER: You're wrong. I am not a killer. 
 CARTWRIGHT: Yet. 
 ALICE: You're scared you're becoming like me. 
 You wanted this. You left Cartwright for me to find. 
 You wanted to push me over the edge. 
 You set me up to kill him so that I would be like you. 
 Kate, you can't give me all the credit. 
 After all, it wasn't that hard. 
 MARY: I'm not asking you to be a hero. 
 I'm just asking you to keep going. 
 [BEEPING] 
 [DISTORTED VOICE] Jacob Kane, city savior, you had to see this coming, right? 
 Hang on. You think our bomber's a Crow? 
 Robles was at the scene of my dad's murder, Kate. 
 The facts line up. - Where is he? 
 I just got a ping on his phone. 
 He's crossing the 1200 block of Rucka Ave. 
 He's headed for the bridge out of Gotham. 
 Got him. 
 [TIRES SQUEALING] 
 What's going on? I just heard gunshots. 
 Our boy Robles seems pretty eager to get out of town. 
 [BEEP] 
 [GRAPPLING LINE WHIPPING] 
 [ROBLES GROANING] 
 Unh! 
 Ohh! 
 You see the badge, bitch? 
 I'm a Crow! I'm gonna destroy you! 
 Like you did Reggie Harris or Alia Nazari or the dozen people at Gotham International? 
 Unh! What do you want? 
 The truth. Did you kill Lucius Fox? 
 Who wants to know? His kid? 
 He's never gonna be able to prove it. 
 Why? 
 I tie up loose ends. 
 [TIMER BEEPING] 
 Luke, evacuate the building immediately. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Disarm the damn bomb, or we both blow up in here! 
 I can't. Only way to disarm it is for the other bomb to go off. And where is that? 
 Ask Commander Kane. 
 What? 
 JACOB: Robles? No. No. He wouldn't do this. 
 I didn't want to believe it either, but the evidence is there, even though he killed a lot of people trying to cover it up. 
 [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] 
 JULIA: Tuxedo One here. KATE: It's me. 
 The second bomb is at Wayne. 
 Do not let anyone touch that button until I give the all clear. 
 Copy that. Good luck. 
 Second bomb's at Wayne Tower. 
 Says who? An associate. 
 [MOUTHS WORDS] Batwoman. 
 Gotcha. Didn't realize you had associates. 
 Just the one. Call Kate. 
 Tell her to stay the hell away from that building. 
 On it. Sir, I can deactivate two of the tripwires, but there's a pressure plate on your chest. 
 If I move it, can... No. We'll let it tick down until we can clear the area around Wayne. 
 You move the truck or tamper with the timer, it blows. 
 If you don't disarm it, it blows. 
 LUKE: I need him alive. KATE: Luke. 
 What are you doing? 
 Introducing myself to the guy who killed my father. 
 Get up. 
 I said get up! 
 Look at me! 
 Luke, this bomb goes off in 5 minutes. 
 Well, it's a good thing my dad planned for that. 
 City's safe. 
 Now the bomb blows up this room and only this room. 
 You really want to die a coward, Robles? 
 Don't. You're fast, but you're not that fast. 
 ROBLES: I'll talk. Just put the gun down. 
 Why... did you kill... my dad? 
 Money. Money? 
 Whose money? That rich asshat Tommy Elliot. 
 Why would Tommy Elliot want Lucius Fox dead? 
 He had a book, some journal Lucius was writing. 
 What journal? No idea. 
 All I know is Tommy was obsessed with it, and after I was recruited to The Crows, I was put on Tommy's personal detail. 
 He paid me 10 grand to rough Lucius up. 
 You shot him in the chest! 
 By mistake. I told your old man if he didn't give Tommy what he wanted I would turn my attention to his kid. You. 
 That set him off. He charged, I pulled the trigger, and then it just snowballed after that. 
 I framed Reggie, and I spent the last 4 years just covering up. 
 Unh! 
 JACOB: It's my fault. I started The Crows to protect Gotham. 
 Now the whole city's on lockdown because of me. 
 Robles going rogue is not your fault. 
 JULIA: It's a high-density blast radius. 
 They're still evacuating. 
 [WHISPERING] You should get out of here. 
 I'm on comms with Batwoman, waiting for the go-ahead, so if anything, you should go. 
 I'm not leaving my boss. 
 Looks like we're stuck with each other then. 
 KATE: Luke, we need to get out of here. 
 There is a bomb strapped to my dad, and I... 
 I need to give him the greenlight to disarm it. 
 Luke. 
 [KATE BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 [HEART BEATING] 
 He took everything from me. 
 Killing him... 
 It won't change what happened to your dad. 
 So we just hand him over to the same court that convicted Reggie Harris? 
 No. I'm dealing with this my way. 
 [ECHOING] 
 I killed Cartwright! 
 What? 
 What? I didn't want to suit up because I feel like a fraud in this thing. 
 I had every chance to stop myself, and I didn't. 
 Luke, the world is short on heroes. 
 Do not let your anger turn you into someone that you are not. 
 [BEEPING ACCELERATES] 
 Grab his arms. 
 KATE: Julia, hit it! 
 Do it. 
 Couldn't have done this without you, Moore. 
 Glad to officially be back, sir. 
 Formalities aside, this is the start of a major overhaul. 
 Robles gave up everyone who took part in Harris's frame job to avoid the death penalty. 
 We are draining the swamp. 
 I'm putting a new strike team in place, and you are co-heading it. 
 I'm not capable of running it solo? 
 So I just got off the phone with my agency. 
 Apparently, I've been recruited to run a Crows strike team. 
 Co-run technically. 
 So where do you want to start? 
 Personal detail, homicide squad? 
 With burgers. Good ones, not the garbage you've been bringing to the motel all week. 
 Go on then. Twist my arm, but you're buying. 
 Company card. 
 You'll get yours at orientation. 
 Bomb squad just left. 
 They're gonna have some follow-up questions, but since you weren't here... 
 Thanks. 
 I should be thanking you for talking me off the ledge last night. 
 That's what partners are for. 
 Hey. Do you know anything about this journal that Tommy Elliot wanted? 
 Yeah. Let's just say my dad's journals weren't poems about his feelings. 
 This was an instruction manual to building every piece of Wayne technology. 
 Phew. Well, it's a good thing that Batwoman's back. 
 Why didn't you tell me about Cartwright? 
 Honestly... 
 Sometimes I feel like you think I'm some infallible hero that makes the right choice every single time. 
 I just... I didn't want to see the look on your face when you realized you were wrong. 
 I'm not wrong. 
 I broke Batman's code. 
 You think you're the only one? 
 Ever wonder why the Joker hasn't reared his head in 5 years? 
 He's not in Arkham, Kate. 
 Both you and Bruce stared into the abyss. 
 The question is how long are you gonna let it stare back at you? 
 MARY: Okay. So I assume that you've seen this because you look good. 
 Oh. Ha! Ha ha ha! 
 Uh, hi, Mary. Kate's not Batwoman. 
 That would be a major time suck from real estate development, her actual job. 
 It's fine. She knows. Mm-hmm. 
 Sh... sh... she knows... She knows what exact... 
 Yeah. We don't have to play this little game anymore. 
 What game? So you now what, Kate? 
 You have a showing in 15 minutes. 
 You should really get going. 
 I'll let you two work this one out. 
 Yeah. Great. So you know what? 
 I'm gonna... you e-mail me that investment strategy, and I'll make sure to... I'll forward you back some comments about the building's blueprints, and we'll make sure to get on the numbers. 
 Now you're just saying words. 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 Time for your therapy, young lady. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It is amazing what I can do with a sharp edge and a little thread, Chief Physician Butler. 
 [MOUSE'S VOICE] What do you say we hit up the ice cream cart before we skip our way right out the front door? 
 I was thinking about what you said about the allure of this place, the protection, the anonymity, the way the walls help the outside world forget all about us. 
 Why be rats on the streets of Gotham when we can be royalty in here? 
 You will be queen, and I will be king. 
 And when everyone has forgotten us, we'll remind them of who we are, and they will never, ever forget us again.
