 Now, like all of you, I am awed by his artistic talent, but I promise you... the greater privilege is to know Kyle West the person. 
 If you witness his energy doing charity work or sharing his experiences at the Institute of the Higher Mind, you see someone so positive and so truly committed to make the lives of people around him better. 
 That's why I'm honored and grateful to call him a colleague and most importantly... my friend. 
 Kyle West, everybody. 
 [cheers and applause]

 ♪ ♪ 
 Here we go, guys, J. Law, Ariana's new beau, and Miley Cyrus has a surprise up her sleeve. 
 Ooh, I'm very intrigued. 
 But first up tonight, we have to talk about Kyle West, who just got his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
 Definitely a lucky guy. Yes. 
 He also has his new movie, "AWOL," and his reunion with his ex, Lisbeth Graves. 
 Is this going to be awkward? 
 You could probably say that, 'cause next week, they're both scheduled to be at the Venice Film Festival premiering their new movies. 
 Everybody's watching because Kyle and Lisbeth haven't seen each other since she called off the wedding... last summer. 
 I need a tarte tartin and a ganache. Gracias. 
 Why are you still here? You're gonna be late. 
 I'm about to run this guy's card. 
 I'll be fine. 
 No, you're not gonna be fine. 
 You're actually auditioning for a Kyle West movie. 
 I'll take your table. You need to prepare. 
 Because I'm really gonna get this part. 
 I don't even know how I got this audition. 
 Megan, stop that. You're amazing. 
 That guy in the suit is really, really hot. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Thank you guys so much, and, uh, enjoy the rest of your day. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 You're an actress, right? 
 I am, in fact, an actress. 
 Really? 
 Or are you just a waitress who's trying to act? 
 Sorry, my douche-bag friend and I have a bet. 
 I've seen you before. 
 Yeah, you've seen her... here, idiot. 
 Have you actually done anything? 
 I was in a film that went to Sundance a few years ago. 
 Any TV? 
 Please. I have 100 on this. 
 "Seattle Med," "Blood Works," and I'm doing "Paper Tigers" later this week. 
 See? I knew she looked familiar. 
 Pay me. 
 I'm not giving you squat until she does a line from one of the shows on her apparently extensive résumé.

 I've always had this image of him as being this grounded, evolved guy. 
 Kyle West? 
 Yeah, he does really interesting movies, and he's into the whole self-actualizing Institute of the Higher Mind stuff.

 We're gonna get an insert of the coke, Megan. 
 You can step out. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Second team. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Fat lady alert. Out of the way. 
 Hi. 
 Les, what are you doing here? 
 I just thought I would waddle on down and see the magic happen. 
 Chloe, how are you? 
 Can we go somewhere to talk? 
 Yeah. Yeah, come here. 
 Okay. 
 So... what's going on? 
 Well, this arrived at my office this morning. 
 Oh, please tell me those aren't photos. 
 Photos? Oh, sweet Jesus. 
 You had s*x with Kyle West. That explains a lot. 
 Excuse me? 
 Never mind. 
 Um, we've been presented with a bit of a situation. 
 Not gonna lie. It's unusual. 
 It's a little Bollywood. It's really weird. 
 It's Bollyweird. 
 What's in the envelope? 
 Sit down. 
 I don't want to sit down, Leslie. 
 You're freaking me out. 
 Okay, well, I want to sit down because I'm about to face-plant, so... 
 [sighs] Okay. 
 [clears throat] 
 This is an offer from Kyle West. 
 For the movie? 
 Technically, no. 
 It's an offer to be... his next wife. 
 His wife? 
 Relax. 
 You start out as the girlfriend, okay? 
 And then if all of that goes well, then the official proposal comes, followed by the engagement period, and then, if you want the full 10 million... 
 $10 million? 
 Paid in installments. 
 Most of it comes after the wedding. 
 And then there's also language in here about children, which involves a second agreement, and then, of course, whatever you get in the divorce, but that part's not commissionable. 
 You should know that. 
 Leslie, th... this isn't real. 
 This is completely real. 
 No, it isn't. 
 This is Kyle's version of a joke. 
 [chuckles] 
 Sweetie... this is Kyle's version of a proposal. 
 He's offering you a contract marriage. 
 Let me see this. 
 [clears throat] 
 "No infidelity. 
 "No drug use. 
 "Approval of all of my interaction with the media"? 
 I don't get this. I've known this guy for two days. 
 Well, you and your 25-year-old v*g1n* made quite an impression. 
 Hey. 
 Megan... 
 I know this is not how we thought we were going to take your career to the next level, but, sweetie, if you sign this contract, you are going to be able to do whatever you want. 
 No. There's no way that I'm doing this. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 Not at all. 
 In fact, Kyle had nothing but good things to say about you. 
 I don't understand, though. 
 The arrangement just ran its course. 
 But I wanted to thank you. 
 Your contribution the last few weeks was very important. 
 We should talk about getting you involved in other Institute projects. 
 It's not going to be that easy. 
 What do you mean? 
 I lived in that unbelievable house with his hands on me every night. 
 I don't want to go back to reality, and I won't do it quietly. 
 The so-called therapist, Sophie... she's not cooperating. 
 We need to get her on board. 
 What can I do? 
 Get her into the facility quietly. 
 Can you handle that? 
 Absolutely. 
 [soft music] 
 [car door closes] 
 Hey. Thanks for coming. 
 If you want to avoid the paparazzi, why don't we just meet at your house? 
 This is actually more private, believe it or not. 
 So... you want me to play the girl on your arm... so you can do what? 
 What's your big secret? 
 There's no big secret. 
 I mean, after what we did last night, do you think I'm really looking for a beard? 
 I don't know. 
 You're an actor. 
 [chuckles] I'm not that good. 
 Wait, Kyle. 
 If you like me, then why don't we just date and see where this goes? 
 Why are we talking about marriage? 
 [sighs] God, you have no idea how much I wish that I could just... just date. 
 I don't know if you're after me for my money or to advance your career. 
 I would never do those things. 
 [sighs] 
 If we just got to know each other like regular people, you would see that. 
 When you met your boyfriend, did you think he was actually the type of guy that would cheat on you? 
 I never thought Lisbeth would just bail on me at our wedding. 
 Did she ever explain herself? 
 There was a note... something about getting lost in my world. 
 Uh, look, this contract's not about making sure that my feelings don't get hurt. 
 I don't... 
 I don't understand, then. 
 It's about my reputation. 
 It's about my... 
 [exhales deeply] it's about my brand... the people that are relying on me to be the actor that everybody has to have in their movie. 
 [sighs] 
 Megan, look, when I'm with you, all the bullshit, it just... it melts away. 
 Okay? And I... 
 I feel like me. 
 [chuckles] 
 I think that you are amazing. 
 But if Kyle West gets humiliated again, well, then that is a pattern, and that pattern's bad for business, okay? 
 That's what the contract and the money are for. 
 That sounds so sad. [chuckles] 
 Is this all worth it? 
 I honestly don't know. 
 But I feel like with you... it would be. 
 We just met. 
 [chuckles] I know. 
 It's crazy. It... this is all crazy, but... 
 I-I've got this feeling that I am almost certain of, that if we just go for it... 
 You should come to Venice with me. 
 To Italy? [chuckles] 
 Don't... don't you ever just chill and go to the zoo? 
 Look, my movie closes the festival next week. 
 We could go see a bunch of films, go to some parties, maybe do a couple of days at Lake Como. 
 [sighs] 
 You don't have to give me an answer now. 
 Take a couple of days. 
 Think about it. 
 You'd be crazy not to. 
 A couple of days... to decide what I am doing with, potentially, the rest of my life. 
 Yeah. 
 [chuckles] 
 ♪ Howl ♪ 
♪ Howl ♪ 
 Kyle West gave you three orgasms? 
 Almost four. 
 Almost four orgasms on the porch of a Mexican bungalow? 
 Gi... you should be paying him $10 million. 
 All right, can we just forget about the s*x for a minute, please? 
 I can't. 
 I mean, number one, I just can't. 
 And two, that's what this is. 
 Kyle's a stupidly hot guy with a private jet and some special skills. 
 I mean, we're not talking long-term potential here. 
 So you think I'm crazy for considering this? 
 I think you're on the rebound, and he has major trust issues. 
 Have you looked at the language in this contract? 
 He's expecting you to be, like, the perfect girlfriend. 
 And I'm sorry, but we both know you haven't been perfect. 
 I knew you would bring that up. 
 You're welcome. 
 It's a land mine. It can blow everything up. 
 I know, but I still have to live my life. 
 Well, you'd be taking a big risk. 
 And that's worse than waiting tables for the rest of my life? 
 I mean, and what if Kyle and I are amazing? 
 Oh, God, you did not just... 
 I'm serious, Shaun. 
 No, look, I've never met anybody like this guy. 
 He totally got me right away, and I-I know that we've only spent a day together... but... it feels like I've known him Mm-hmm. for so much longer than that. 
 I know, but... maybe it's because somehow... he's what I've been looking for. 
 Look, there's no law that says you have to decide now. 
 You should wait. 
 Wait till he gets back from Venice. 
 Then give him an answer. 
 [sighs] 
 I could. 
 But it'd be really nice to go to Venice.

 Take me with you. 
 Hello. 
 Terence Anderson, this is Megan Morrison. 
 Playing Megan Morrison this time. 
 Hardest role of all. 
 Well, I'm a very big fan of yours. 
 Shall we take care of business? 
 Talent gets you noticed... maybe. 
 And looks, sure, for a moment. 
 But the only thing that gets you a seat at the table in this town is force of personality. 
 I'm talking about complete... and utter confidence in who you are. 
 When you have that, people are drawn to you. 
 They don't know why, but suddenly they need you. 
 And they will turn their lives inside out to be with you. 
 But you have to work your ass off. 
 You have to be the one willing to do the things that scare everybody else to death. 
 That's the difference between talent and success. 
 You're off to a great start, but you have to keep doing it. 
 I plan to. 
 Okay, Annika. 
 Let's see what we can do about getting you an agent.
