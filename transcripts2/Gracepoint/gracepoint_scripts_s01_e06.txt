 Narrator : Previously, on Gracepoint... 
 Emmett : 100 bucks says that's the boat they used, Hey, what are you doing with that? You said you were gonna stop. I know men who'd rape you. If you or your family ever need to talk, call me. Where were you on the night of Danny's death? I was up late trying to write a sermon, trying. I know about you and Gemma Fisher. Emmett : You can't tell anyone about this. You listen to the doctors, and you get some proper help. Do you have a conviction for statutory rape? So you send me off to question Jack 'cause you got something better? Your Jack Reinhold piece is next. Yesterday I saw Owen talking to Jack Reinhold. He's got a history. They're gonna say that I did it! I didn't do it! That camera has Danny passing by at 11:07. I'd put him at Harvey Ridge around 11:35. Let's see how long this takes. Be as precise as we can be. The later he gets to the hut, the smaller our window for the murder. That sound good to you, Miller? I'm not sure "good" is the word I'd use. Emmett : I still want to know why Jack Reinhold had Danny's phone. Did forensics get anything off it? No, it got soaked in the bottom of the kayak. Aw! No data, no texts, no call log. Two prints that match our database, Jack's and Mark's. Mark touched the phone when Jack brought it over to the house, and Jack found the phone, so... Or claimed to 'cause his prints were already on it. But here's what I don't understand. I always thought that Danny had a smartphone because Tom was constantly complaining that Danny's phone was better than his. So where is it? Good question. Both Mark and Beth say that he only had that old one. Think he bought it on his own? He did have all that cash in his room. Where from, Jack Reinhold? Yeah, none of this fits. Jack is 73. How would he get a body two miles down the coast, boat or no boat? Maybe he had an accomplice. Yeah. [Sighs] You talk to Tom at the end of the night? A little. He was tired. He just wanted to go home. Tell him thanks for me. This was important, timing the route. He did right by Danny. Jack paid a visit to the Solanos on Sunday. He was pleading and begging as they threw him out. Come on, Owen, are we doing this story together? What's that supposed to mean? It means shared byline. Means a little bit more money. I figured out I make about 400 bucks a story, on average. I'll give you 200, cash. It might come in useful with your mom. Wow. You really go for the jugular. I thought I was trying to help you out. Jack pled guilty to the statutory rape charge. He admitted it? I was gonna bring it to Kathy, see what she thought. You're going to Kathy with it? I work for her. Yeah, I know, and I know you respect her, but what do you think she's gonna say? She's probably gonna say that we should sit on it, wait for Jack to respond. And you already gave him that chance. 10:40, we write fast, we can have something in by tomorrow. San Francisco Globe or Gracepoint Journal,  your choice. [Reporter on TV] An eerie silence enveloped the town of Gracepoint... We're on the news again. To stage a reconstruction along the route where Danny Solano was last seen the night before his body was found beneath the cliffs. Are we ever gonna talk about it? By "it," you mean what you did? [Turns TV off] [Sighs] I... I've been with you... since I was 16 years old, Mark. What don't you get from me? Are you still attracted to me? Of course I am. Not of course! You slept with someone else! Why? Am I not inventive enough in bed? Is that it? That's not it. What is it? Are you bored with me? No. Then what? Maybe... [Sighs] Maybe it was the opposite. I don't know what that means, Mark. Maybe it's a part of you that's bored with me, that wishes that life would have been a little bit different, 'cause I know you had ideas about how life would be. Like, you have other plans. You probably wouldn't have even married me if it wasn't for Chloe. That isn't fair. I mean, but it's coming from somewhere. Oh, God. So now it's my fault? Hm. You're putting what you did on me. No, that's not what I'm saying, not at all. Gemma, that was a surprise. To be wanted. And while you were out enjoying your surprise, our son died. You don't think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life knowing that? Wishing that I was here? With Danny, you, at home? Well, you weren't. I really don't want to lose you, Beth. Mm. I feel like I already have. I'm pregnant. [Sniffs] Well, you have to keep it. No, I don't have to do anything. [Turns on TV] Showers heavy at times with occasional thunderstorms and a high of 89 degrees. Partial clearing... What are you doing? Laptop. That'd be this way. Mm-hmm. Oh, here? No, stop it. I was joking. I'm trying to sleep. Fine. Go back to sleep. Mmm. [Sighs] First byline, pretty exciting. Yeah, yeah. Ugh. God, I need coffee. What? This is not what we wrote. Before you say anything... In the Big Leagues now, huh? Shot straight to the top. Kathy... Apparently, a promise to your editor, your so-called mentor... your words... means nothing to you. For this? Will you hear me out, please? Pointing the finger at an innocent man. - You know Jack's not...  I didn't write that! Your name's right here, Owen. I know, but the entire article's rewritten, it's amped up! That's not the version we submitted. We submitted something else last night. I can show you. Go on, get out of my office. This is a first. Thought I'd stop by on my way to work, say hi. You work too early. Nah, I work too much. Did Owen send you to check up on me? Do I need to check up on you? Oh, don't do that. Don't detective me. You all right, Sara? I could be, if you felt like helping me out a little. [Scoffs] You're unbelievable. Look, I got no furniture. A thousand bucks, 900? Oh, I've already given you three times that much. It's not enough you're stealing from your own son? Tell me what you did with that money. No? God, I don't know why I even bothered to stop by. I saw something, Ell. I don't believe you. The night that Danny was killed. Do you even know what night it was? It was a Thursday. All right. Tell me what you saw. You lend me a thousand bucks, I-I will. You need professional help, Sara. Vince : He admitted it, s*x with a minor! He pled guilty, and we're still letting him go count sea lions with our kids. You don't even have kids. What does that matter? I spent the day in jail because they thought I did something. There's no real evidence yet. So we're just gonna wait around until he does it again, huh? Till he hurts some other kid? How's that gonna fee... Enough! You don't think I've thought about this? About him? About anyone else in this town? I'm not a cop. I can't do anything. If you want to work yourself up, fine! You do what you want to do. Just please stop hounding me! Is Reinhold a credible suspect? Close ties with Danny through the Wildlife Club, plus no alibi for that night. Also had Danny's phone... one of them, at least... in his possession. And a previous conviction for s*x with a minor. Except there's no sexual element to Danny's murder. That we know of. Who else? Nothing more on our backpacker? Not till you get me that warrant. We're checking campgrounds 100 miles in each direction. Park service put up some photos. So far, no one's seem him. You still giving the priest a hard time? Emmett : No alibi, insomniac,  close contact with kids through the Sunday school. Plus there's a straight view from the rectory  to the Solanos' street. Easy access to Danny. We're doing a background check. Tread lightly. Let's try not to pick a fight with the church. Well, you better hope it's not him then. Paul : This place seems busier. Those two, they're just in from Seattle. I've got press in... eight rooms now. That's making up for missing tourists. Doesn't feel right though. It feels like I'm housing sharks that are just here to feed on Danny's murder. And I've got Carver staying here too, right? So it's just all a little bit hairy. What? What are you smiling at? Are you smiling because I said, "hairy"? No, the... nothing hairy about paying your bills. - (Paul) Beth? Beth, hi. Paul : Hey. Hi, what can I help you with? Oh. Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Beth, that's enough! Oh, that's enough? It was a mistake, okay? Yeah, you're damned right it was a mistake. I'm sor... Beth, I am sorry! I am so sorry about Danny. Don't you dare bring Danny into it! You do not deserve to say his name. Okay. You come near my family again, I swear to God, Gemma, I swear to God, you will regret you ever moved here. Beth... Hey, Beth, wait... Don't come after me, Paul! [Sighs] [Door buzzer] I served my time. I never hurt Danny. I never hurt a single child in my life. You can make a complaint. Call the paper. What would that do? Probably nothing. [Sighs] Better for you to cooperate, help us clear your name. You think I haven't heard that before? "Help us and we'll help you," and the next thing I know, you're putting me in handcuffs over something I didn't do. All I want, Mr. Reinhold, is to find out who killed Danny. Well, I didn't do it, and you know it. You don't have a shred of evidence, and I made that perfectly clear to Owen Burke. You have your partner tell her nephew he'd better watch hisself. I told you to stay away from me! Chloe, give me a chance! I know I shouldn't have taken Danny with me. Look, I know you hate me right now,  but I got something I think you need to know, about Jack Reinhold. She was in the journal building with you? I'd locked up for the night. I don't know how she got in. She said she knew men who'd rape me. She said what? I'm not saying this has anything to do with Danny. I told myself I wouldn't interfere with your work. Kathy, that... Okay, I will look into it. If she ever bothers you again, you call me directly. Okay? Thank you. Of course. By the way, you're not interfering. It's my nephew who's interfering. I don't know what he's thinking. I was in Wildlife as a kid. He was always reaching out, putting his arm around us, especially when we were in our bathing suits. Jack put his hand on my back once, and I knocked it off. Told him leave me alone. He put his hand on you once, or more than once? Well... all the time. Chloe, let him answer. I can think of... four or five times. Hey, look, I want them to catch whoever did this to Danny, all right? You know, I was in Wildlife, and he never put his hands on me. Show him. Three guys who were in Wildlife with me,  and their phone numbers. They'll back him up, every single one. You want to call them? I'll write up what Dean's saying? Nope. I think they should take this to the police, let them look into it, not us. You gave me your number. You said you would help. I know. You can handle this one on your own. Another byline in the Globe, some more cash. You don't want that? No, not like this. [Door bell jingling] You're absolutely certain about everything you just said? Of course he is. Beth : I just wanted to apologize, not to her, to you. I can't believe I did that. No, you know what? I can. I-I can believe it. God, it felt good. Well... do you think I have to pay her? I... no, no, no, no. Well... I'm not paying her anything. She's the one who did the damage. [Sighs] Have you thought about seeing anyone? A bereavement Counselor? I don't want to see a Counselor, Paul. A Counselor will want me to stop being angry. I need my anger. It's all I've got right now. [Sighs] Mark knows about me being pregnant. He said I had to keep it. Well, I think he's right. [Scoffs] Well, if the men think that's what's best... [Laughing] Hey, no. That's what I was thinking. I hate it. This thing growing inside me, I don't want it. It's not right. Danny should just be growing. I am not done with Danny yet. I want him, not something in his pla... Oh, Beth, you... I had one job as his mom, and I failed him! Hey, hey, hey, Beth. Beth, hey, look at me. Hey, you didn't fail him, okay? You are a wonderful mother. [Scoffs] A wonderful woman. Look, we just... we just have to find a way to lift you out of his hopelessness. [Scoffs] [Laughs] Hey, have... have you given more thought to the memorial service? Yeah, I want to do it, but Mark's still not sure. I think it could be beautiful. Hey, hey. You know, we'd celebrate Danny's life, give thanks for the time we did have with him. You know, I have a feeling it would get a lot of attention. You know, everyone in the community will want to come. Hey, just let me... let me do this for you. 
 
 Still short. There's 200 there. 200 will get you half your fridge back. Which half you want? Listen, do... do you deal in boats? Female : Jack? Jack Reinhold? [Photos snapping] What? Over here. Oh. Jack. Jack. Just a few questions, Jack. Stay in here. They'll take off eventually. Oh, stay in here, stay inside. Huh, Carver? That's your big answer to this? Clear them out of here! I've got a shop to run! Not today you don't. [Sighs] Jack, I'm sorry, we're stretched really thin, but maybe we can send somebody by to make sure things don't escalate. You're letting this go on purpose! You're just hoping that I'll snap, say something you want me to say! You're asking for help but you won't talk to us! Hmm? I can understand why they think you're hiding something. [Chuckles] [Sighs] I was a piano teacher, and she was one of my students. No boys. Just a girl. A girl I loved. You guys can fill in the gaps. You had s*x with one of your students? No, Ellie. I had a relationship with one of my students. You had s*x how many times? What, do you think I carved notches on my bedpost? Were you the one to initiate it? It was a mutual attraction, Ellie. So who told the police? Her father. He followed us. Panicked. Called the cops. She fought with him. She tried to tell them, but they couldn't hear it. They wanted to make an example out of me. [Sighs] So I served two years, did my time. I was lucky to get out alive. Oh. She was 16 and 11 months. Four more weeks, and we'd have been fine. Why didn't you tell us this earlier? Because it is none of your business. It's my business only. Did you ever see that girl again? See her? I married her. She was 18 and I was 40. Thanks very much. Doing the right thing. Oh, Joe, hey. Oh, hey, Jeff. Glad I caught you. What's this? It's a petition, against Jack Reinhold, to kick him off Wildlife. Why don't you go inside and mail this for me, okay, man? Thanks. [Sighs] Hey, boy. He really likes you. What's his name? Archie. Archie, meet... Tom Miller. You're the detective's kid. You like dogs, Tom? Yeah, but my mom doesn't let us have pets. You can take him for a walk sometime if you want. Really? Sure. He hates being cooped up inside all day. Don't you, boy? I'm Susan. We're down by the water, near the cliffs, fifth trailer on the right. Okay. Come and knock on my door sometime. Will you do that, Tom? Yup. Fifth trailer on the right. Anytime. Hey, what are you doing to protect Jack Reinhold? Not your problem, Mr. Coates. We'll deal with it. Hey, he is a member of the church. I spoke to him. He's terrified. We're doing what we can. Well, it isn't enough. There's a mob of press outside of his shop. You'd rather they talk to you, is that it? What's that supposed to mean? Don't worry. I'll deal with him. I'm sorry. Can I just say for the record, next time you have a crime scene on the beach, call another guy. It's been a complete nightmare. We've eliminated 400 pieces of evidence as irrelevant. What have you got that's relevant? Cigarette butts? All found within a few feet of Danny's body. They'd have been there a couple hours earlier, they would have washed away at high tide, but they didn't. They were left there that morning, stubbed into the sand around the same time the body was found. All the same brand. And high tar content. Very unusual. Three cigarettes. What's wrong? Just all that way to dump a body, and then stand there and smoke? More important question: Who smokes these cigarettes? Owen : It was my dad's boat, so it's probably a little rusty. Uh, which one? What's the problem? You forget what it looks like? It's not here. Somebody must have taken it. Come on, sweet love. Come on. When did you last see the boat? Seven, eight weeks ago. With the motor and everything? Yeah. Just like dad always did it. By the way, it wasn't insured, so... Okay. Owen, I... ooh, I went to see your mom this morning, and I don't think I did much good. She is a very troubled woman. Yeah, I'm aware of that. Don't let her problems force you into making decisions that you will come to regret, okay? So what happens if it's the boat that burned? Hey. Hey. I was just... No, it's okay. You don't have to explain. I know about the baby. Were you listening at the door? Mom sounded really angry. You have to make her keep it. Yeah, I can't do that. I wish I could, but... - I'll talk to her. No. You're not gonna talk to her. That's something that me and your mother... I lost a brother. I don't care if this baby was an accident. What do you think I was? [Doorbell ringing] Don't make this any harder than it has to be. Is that why you're sitting in Danny's room? To make it easier? [Knocking at the door] I didn't know if I should come, uh, but a bunch of people are headed over to Jack's house. Vince is rallying up a lynch mob. Jack Reinhold! Where you hiding, Jack? Guys, come on, let's not do anything stupid, all right? Ah, Doug, we just want to talk to him. There's nothing wrong with that, right? Hey, Reinhold! [Men yelling] Request for backup, Reinhold residence. Backup, over. Vince : Come on out, Jack! [Men yelling] Hey, Reinhold! Why don't you put down the kiddie p0rn and come talk to me man-to-man? Jack! What would you know about being a man, Vince? A lot more than you, you freak. Hey. Why don't you put your hands on me, huh? Put your hands on me, Jack! Hey, no, back off! Back off! You told me to handle it, and I'm handling... I said back off! [Panting] They've been saying a lot of things about you, Jack. I'm not what they're calling me. I didn't go near your boy. You had his phone though. He left it in the back of a kayak, I swear to you. Yeah? You've also been in prison. Underage kids, was it? What am I supposed to think? What am I supposed to think, Jack? [Sighs] There was a girl. We had an affair. She was 16, the same age as Beth when you got her pregnant. Mark, we got married. We had a son together. Well, then how come they're not with you? Mark, he died at nine years old. He was in a car accident. We tried, we tried to put it back together. Grief just ripped us apart. They're saying that, uh, I wanted to be near boys because I'm a pedophile. Nah, that's not it. I miss my son. I miss him so much. I mean, you know, what kind of a world is this where it's wrong for a man to seek affection? I would never, ever hurt Danny. Never. You know, Mark, we're the same, in a way. No parent should ever outlive their child. Your son, he was a good boy, a really good boy. You okay, Mark? Yeah. Why don't you guys just go home, man? What do you mean go home? What's he saying to you? Just go home! You got to leave. It's not safe for you here. This is my home now. But you can make another place your home. I mean, the people have made up their minds about you. If you want to be safe, move far, far away from here. Ellie? [Groans] Hey, Hugo, I just... The picture you gave me of that boat? Mm. It's a match with the one we got. Color, molding. It's looking likely. Really? I still need to confirm, but with Danny's blood on the burned one, if it is a match, we're there, one step away. Oh, okay. Hey, uh, you feel like grabbing a drink? What, you... do you mean... Just you... you and me? [Laughs] Yeah. Oh. Well, Hugo, I'm... I'm married. So that's a deal-breaker for you? Well, yeah, Hugo. I'm happily married. All right. That's fair. Lots of people are happily married though, no? Hugo, I'm actually happily married. Okay. Okay. Must be nice. Yeah, it is. It's really nice. You want anything? A cup of coffee, or... No, no, I'm good. I'm good on coffee, thanks. Okay. Did Danny know? Danny know wha... About you and Gemma, did he know? No, he didn't know. What were you doing? Nothing, I'm ju... You were emailing her? No, I... I wouldn't do that. I-I said it's over. I'm... it's over. Were you reading the news? Because I don't want us to do that. I can't stand it anymore. No, I'm... I'm looking at pictures, at baby pictures of Danny. After you told me, I just... Okay, stop. - I can't help it. Mark... I'm not pressuring you. [Sighs] I'm really not. I just want to look at my boy. I just want to spend five minutes with him, just five minutes. So, uh, this is a little odd, but the... our burned boat, it belonged to my brother-in-law, Owen's dad. He's been, um, out of the picture for a while. He took off for Florida, so, um... The boat that was burned with Danny's DNA was your brother-in-law's? It was left on shore. It was chained to a post. Anyone with bolt cutters could have... Who knew it was there? Owen, my sister, anyone else who keeps a boat there. I'm not sure. Okay, check that your brother-in-law wasn't back for a visit. See if Hugo can get any other prints off the shards. Match them against all the elimination prints. Well, uh, okay, but, um, Sir, uh, would you mind asking Hugo for me? Me? Yeah. He actually just made a pass at me. Why did he do that? Thank you very much. You're married. I know. He... he knows that. [Groans] A fling with a crime scene investigator could be interesting. What? What... what does that mean? Attention to detail. Used to having their hands everywhere. Okay, that's gross. Dirty Hugo. That's so gross. That is nasty. Thank you for that visual, by the way. You're welcome. [Ellie sighs] Sir? Yeah? What if we don't close this case? If we don't find Danny's killer? We will. But you didn't in Rosemont. How long have you been waiting to bring that up? I haven't been waiting. Rosemont was different. How? Well, you've really been holding this in, huh? A mistake was made. A big mistake. By you? Thank you for the visit, Miller, good night. Sir... I've known these people all my life. They're my friends. I can't let them down. We won't. [Soft piano music] ♪ ♪ [Knocking at the door] Hi. Hi. Hi. I saw you come back in. I hope this is okay. - Oh, come in. Thanks. There you go. Uh, so I've got a lot of press staying here, and I kind of figured out that isn't the best for you, right? Bumping into them, etcetera, etcetera? But all my normal bookings have canceled, sadly, and I don't want to inconvenience you, but I'd really like to try and make it through till the spring, if that's even possible. Sorry, are you asking me a question? No. Uh, sort of. I want to offer you a deal... as an apology. I'll charge the department half the price for your room, and you can consider it my contribution to the investigation. You like me staying here that much? Well, I've had worse guests. It must be really hard running a place like this. Oh. You have no idea. You ever get to relax? Yeah. Well... I have my ways. [Both chuckle] So would you like to relax a bit with me here tonight? Oh, God, no. Oh. That didn't come out...  No, no. The way I wanted that to come out. I misunderstood, that's okay. What I meant is that I... it's not that I wouldn't or that you're... Of course. I ju... I wouldn't want to worry. Worry about? Worry that you'd pass out on me. Oh. Okay. Excellent. Sorry. Actually, have you even told anybody that you're ill yet?  'Cause I think you should. I mean, maybe your boss  or Ellie or... I don't want to be the only person knowing about this. If you want to try to help, make a contribution to the investigation, leave it alone. Let me finish my work. Well, what if you keel over again? I'm not going to. But you already have. I'm not going to. I have a job to finish, so... Okay then. Yup, I'll...  Let you finish your, uh... okay. [Clears throat] Good night. [Door closing] Our Father, who art in Heaven... [Phone buzzing] [Groans] Yeah?
