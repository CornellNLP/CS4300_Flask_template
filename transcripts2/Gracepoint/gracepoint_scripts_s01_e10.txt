 Emmett :Previously on Gracepoint... 
 Cause of death: Blunt trauma, one blow to the head. 
 Harsh blow. 
 Forensics from the hut. 
 Boot print in the mud up the hill match with the print they found inside. 
 You're blacking out. 
 I can't allow you to carry a weapon. 
 Emmett :Danny's life touched many people. 
 We'll be looking at all those connections. 
 If you or someone you know has noticed anything unusual, please, come forward now. 
 I urge everyone, don't hide anything, because we will find out. 
 If a member of your family or a friend or a neighbor has been behaving differently in the past days or weeks, please tell the police immediately. 
 There will be no hiding place for Danny's killer. 
 We will catch whoever did this. 
 I've got no choice here, Carver. 
 I need until the end of the day, eight hours. 
 Morgan :What difference will that make? 
 The case is going to Detective Miller. You should consider someone else. Really? After all this time, I thought you'd grown to respect each other. I'll be out by 6:00. I've got another witness, Vince. She saw you that same night carrying what looked like a body towards Mark's plumbing van. My mom needs her meds. And I need an explanation. She probably hasn't eaten since yesterday morning. You either need to let me go check on her, or you have to send someone over. I'm not saying anything until I know she's all right. Get someone over to Vince's mother, and get back in with him. What was he doing that night? What was he doing two nights ago when we were at the hut? Minute by minute. If it wasn't Vince your sister saw, who was it? Bam, bam, bam, bam. I'm sorry? Never mind. I am going to get some coffee, and then I'm following orders. I gotta check in with CSI, see what they got on the van. Did you find your boy's computer? He says it was stolen. Do you believe him? I called Joe, asked him to come in. What, this morning? You're calling him in, and you didn't tell me? I'm telling you now. You lost your computer. Right, I left it in my bag at school, and it got stolen. Paul Coates said you threatened to accuse him of hitting Danny if he gave this to us. You threatened the priest? Did Paul Coates ever hit Danny? I don't know. [Camcorder clicks off] We can, uh, we can wait if you want to go get help. No, no, no. No, it's fine. Wait. I'll use my phone. Here, all right. So... Did Danny ever tell you that Paul hit him? No. Did you ever see anyone hit Danny? I never saw anyone else hit Danny. Why did you smash your computer, Tom? Go ahead, answer him. I had my emails on it. Your emails with whom? With Danny. Are these your emails with Danny? How did you those? Rescued from your hard drive. Danny was using a different email address from his home computer. You're the only person he wrote to from that new address. Actually, you and one other person. Why didn't you tell us that you and Danny had been arguing? Because in these emails, Danny's being kind of rough on you. You were reaching out to him after his dad hit him, asking him to come back to the soccer team, and a little later, he's calling you a Dumb Jock and a conformist. Why is he saying these things? I don't know. He never explained it. And then finally he wrote to you, "Leave me alone. You're a follower. Your dad's probably disappointed in you too. He's bored by you. You just don't know it." He really said that? Did it hurt you when you read what your friend wrote? Maybe a little. Did it hurt you so much that you wanted to hurt Danny? Okay, we're done. We're through here. If you want to accuse my son, we'll get a lawyer. Yeah, we're through. Come on. That's all for now anyway. Oh, Tom, what shoe size are you? Six. What about you, Joe? Ten. Ellie :What's going on? Why did you call me all the way down here? I was here before, on this beach. I came here as a kid. Some campground close to the cliffs. I tried looking for it when I first got here. You came to Gracepoint on vacation? Yeah. My parents were about to break up. They spent the entire time fighting. How'd it go with Vince? He says he was carrying a small deer. A deer? Mm-hmm. He claims he was out hunting the night of Danny's death. He says he cut through a farmer's fence out by Hill Road. Interesting. Um, I spoke to Joe. He said things went all right. Took Tom out for ice cream. Good. Well, did it go okay? [Phone buzzing] Hello. Danny's smartphone's back on. We have coordinates and a trace on the signal. Emmett :All right. Send it through to this number. Happening now, Sir. Okay. What's going on? I got to take a call. My last day. Lots to... Wrap up. I can wait if you... No, no, no, I got Yeaton. Go, get back in with Vince. Go, I'll meet you there. All right. Miller. Yep? You've done good work on this case. [Suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [No audible dialogue] [Thunder rumbles] I'll tell you everything. Talk to me. Danny :What's Oaxaca like? Joe :Oh, it's beautiful. White sands, huge mountains, cranky toddlers. [Chuckles] [Zipper sound] [Rattles] I brought you this. [Rattling] Thanks. [Chuckles] [Sighs] I missed you. I missed you too. Things been okay here? No more dad drama? No. I really did miss you, you know. Hmm. Don't. Joe :It was the first time we'd met there. We'd only spent afternoons at the house. Tom was at soccer and Dylan napping. Afternoons doing what? Talking. And that's it, just getting to know each other. How long were you doing this? Maybe three months, a little less. Danny came over one day upset, looking for Tom. He told me Mark was pissed that he had quit the team, that he'd hit him. Go on. I listened. I think that meant something to him. So you lured him to the hut. I didn't lure him. We planned to meet after Mexico. To continue your chats. And what else? I don't know, neither of us knew what would happen. Come on, Joe. No, it's true. And the second he said no, the second he pulled back, I respected that. I... I can't do this. Oh, come on, Danny, sit down. No, I shouldn't have come here. You don't mean that. Come. Don't touch me. What? Don't be ridiculous. It's me. I have to go. Well, not like this. We need to figure out... Danny! Aah! Danny! We were both scared... [Sighs] And confused. The boy was 12 years old. I know. It was too much for him. I get that now. He ran to the edge of the cliff and threatened to jump. I told him everything was okay. I was sorry. I said, "go home, just go home. Everything will be fine." No, it won't be. Yes, it will. I promise. You're not normal. You're sick. It's my problem. You should just go home. Just go home, go to bed, and we'll forget this ever happened. We'll forget we were ever friends. Is that what you want, to forget that you ever knew me? Of course not. Danny! And no one has to know about this... not Tom, not your parents. I have to tell them. You don't. You can't. Danny? It was an accident. I thought he was running away. I-I grabbed for him. I grabbed his sweatshirt. He just tripped, slammed his head into a rock, hard. I never, ever meant to hurt him. I cared about him. I care about him. [Grunts] [Engine humming] [Grunts] [Panting] [Grunts] [Panting] [Breathing heavily] This is not who I am. No? You were attracted to him. Sexually. I'm not sure why that matters now. It all matters now. I need to have the facts, Joe. I got to understand. If I can't understand it, why should you? [Whispering] It was a horrible accident. Did you slam his head against a rock when he refused you? No, absolutely not. But you were angry with him. No. The $500 we found in Danny's room, was that from you? It was for his cell phone bills, so he could pay in cash. I told Ellie I needed it for the house,  home repair stuff. I've destroyed my own family. The night before at the hut, why did you call and then take off? I wanted it to be you, just you, to confess. It was just too much with Jack's suicide and lying to Ellie. And once I saw her, I just ran. Does she know? No. I can't tell her. You have to tell her. CSI's scouring the van. What do you think we're gonna find when we... Sir, do you mind? Interview terminated. 12:43 P.M. Ellie :What are you doing? That is my suspect. Sit down, Miller. What's going on? It's not him. How do you know? Please sit. Please. [Sighs] I have to ask you a couple of questions. Where were you the night of Danny Solano's death? What? I'll explain. Let's keep things simple. I'll ask questions. You give me answers. You think it was me? Where were you? Are you... you're serious. Please, Ellie. Do not call me Ellie. Tell me where you were the night Danny Solano died. I was in bed. We'd just got back from vacation that day. We had been flying all day, two flights, a long drive. I was exhausted. I got Dylan in the bath. I got the kids to brush their teeth. I unpacked. I took a sleeping pill, and I went to bed. What time? I... I don't know. Early-ish, 9:00, 9:15. Did you notice Joe come to bed? No, I just told you I was exhausted, and those sleeping pills... I'm not answering any more of these questions. Tell me what's happening. What are you doing? Huh? Why are you coming close to me? It was Joe. Joe killed Danny Solano. Why are... why would you even say that? Why... why are you saying that? What...  he didn't do that. He would never do something like that. We have him in custody. He confessed. [Shallow breaths] [Gags] [Vomiting] [Cries out] It's okay. Ah! It's okay. [Groans] No. No, but Susan Wright said she saw Vince... Medium build, medium height, same hat pulled down low. She thought it was Vince. Maybe she wanted it to be Vince, but it was Joe. No, not Joe. [Whispers] Please not Joe. You're wrong. I'm not wrong. I have to see him. You don't touch him. You don't do anything that would compromise the investigation. Ellie. Sweetheart... Is it true? I'm not what you think I am. What are you? He was 12... Years... Old. I know. I can't explain. 12... Years... Old! I just need you to know I'm a good man. I'm not a... No, you're not, Joe! [Ellie grunting] Get her off! Take her out of here! [Ellie, screaming] Why? Aah! No! Why? Why did you do that? Why? No... why? 
 
 Emmett :We've booked you a double room at the motel out by the highway. Pete'll meet you there with Dylan and Tom. You can pick some stuff up from home on the way. Don't talk to anyone. Close the blinds. Don't answer the phone if it isn't me. This doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense. Well, he claims it doesn't to him either, that it was someone else, some other part of him. How could he say "I'm a good man" after what he did? All these years, this is who he was? This is what he... Wanted? I wish I had some answers for you. It's gonna take time. [Knocking on door] Ready. Thank you, Frank. I'll tell the Solano family. At 6:00 P.M. I'll make a brief statement to the media, and then we all need to be ready. This is gonna crack open a fault line in this town. You all know Detective Miller. She has been removed from the case and placed on leave with full pay. There's no suggestion she knew, absolutely no suggestion she covered anything up. You're her colleagues and friends. She's gonna need you. She's gonna need all of us. I'm sorry, Ellie. We were happy here. Ellie :Here you go. Look at this. Okay. What a nice room we have, huh, honey? Look. It's pretty good, isn't it, Tom? Are you gonna tell me what's happening? Yeah, sweetie, I-I will, but I just want to get your brother settled first. It's okay. Emmett :We've charged someone with Danny's murder. Beth :Oh, God, I don't want to know. No, but it's good, it's good. It's what we want. Please, please do not tell us that it's someone that we know. Joe Miller... has confessed. What? He and Danny had been meeting secretly for months. Oh, my God. What does that mean? We don't know the details, just that we believe we have the right person. But Ellie... She didn't know. Dad. Mark. Mark. [Door opens and closes] We found out who killed Danny. Tom... It was dad. No, it wasn't. He wouldn't. He didn't. He did. I'm so sorry. I have no idea what would make him do something like that, but I do know that it is not your fault or Dylan's. Or mine. Tom. I'm here with you, and I will never leave you. I will always love you, and I will always protect you. I need to ask you a question though. Did your dad ever... touch you or Dylan? Did he ever do anything physical that made you feel uncomfortable? No. Never. You can tell me, Tom. You can tell me if he did. He didn't. You know that you do not blame yourself if your dad... No, stop it! I told you no. Okay. Now stop asking me. He never touched me. Tommy. [Crying] I don't understand. I don't understand what's going on. What am I supposed to do? I don't know, sweetheart. I don't understand either. No, you don't. There's also kids' sneaker prints, size six all over this area. Size six? Why did you have one of Danny's crossword books in your backpack? Tom. What are you not saying? [Whispers] Tom... Please look at me. Is there something you never told me about the night Danny died? [Footsteps] I can't do this. Oh, come on, Danny. Don't touch me. Don't be ridiculous. It's me. Danny :I have to go. Not like this. We need to... Danny! Danny! No one has to know about this...  not Tom, not your parents. Danny :I have to tell them. Joe :You can't. What are you doing to him? What are you doing? Stop! Leave him, dad! He's my friend! Joe :Stop, stop! Danny? Danny. Danny! Come on. Danny. Go home. But... Go to bed. Don't do anything. Don't say anything. This is my fault. This is completely my fault. I will take care of it. Go! What are we gonna do? Mom, what are we gonna do? [Buzzer] Here? I can give you five minutes, Mark. Mark. [Sniffles] You were our friend. You were in our home. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I left him on the beach so you would find him. Do you hear yourself? He came to me. That's how it started, because you let him down. You hit him. One time. And I hate myself for it, and I'm gonna have to suffer with that for the rest of my life. You did things to him, didn't you? You did. I know you say you didn't, but I know you're lying. I'm not. I swear. There are things you don't know. I cared about Danny. I would never intentionally hurt him. I really cared for him. He's not yours to care for! For your sake, I hope they keep you locked up for a long time. [Knocking on door] All right? Hey. Hey. Here. Just go for a walk or whatever you need. Yeah. Just... Okay. Okay? I got comic books, processed sugar. You hanging in there, bud? Tom's gonna be fine. We all are... Right? Okay, thank you. Yeah. Bye. Beth. How could you not know? Hey, this is Julianne. Leave a message, and we'll talk soon, maybe. Bye. Hey, it's me, dad. This'll be a surprise, but I'm thinking of taking your advice to take care of myself and maybe get that surgery I've been avoiding down in San Francisco. Anyway, I was wondering, um, when your graduation is exactly? I was thinking I could, um, schedule it for after. I could come there, and then you could visit me, maybe. Spoon-feed your invalid father. How's that for an offer, huh? Anyway, no obligation. Okay, so that's it. Give me a call if you ever feel like it. You're not too angry, I hope. I love you. It's time, Mark. Paul :The Bible says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. The Lord is faithful and righteous, cleansing us from unrighteousness. Be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. [Buzzer] That's what you meant by "I'm a good man"? He shouldn't have told you. Why? I was trying to protect him. You were with his best friend. That's why I'm doing this. What happened was my fault. That, and I love Tom. I love you. Don't say that. Don't you dare say that to me. It's true. I never touched Danny. But you were going to. What do I do? Tell me what you want. Do I know everything now? Yes. All of it, every single bit of it, stays between us. Whole town's turned out, looks like. Except for us. You always said I was too close... That I couldn't see what was right in front of me. I wanted to be wrong. I really did. What made you know it was Joe? Who could it be if it wasn't Vince? And the way he behaved when Tom is being on you. And then the email account on Danny's missing phone... it only had two contacts, Tom... And him. Are you leaving? I shouldn't be here. And I... I need to get back to... This doesn't feel right to me, Miller. I hope you know that. I just keep thinking about your family, your boys. My boys will be fine. I'll make sure of it. What you gonna do? Take them someplace else. Give them a new start. Away from Gracepoint? How can we stay here? How can we walk down Main Street? Look at us... the Former Detectives Club. Good night, Emmett. Night. Hey, look. They're everywhere. Mark :How'd everybody know? Paul, was that you? I passed the word. Maybe the word was good. [Phone buzzing] _ Wow, you figured it out. What? Your phone. Uh, yes. Hi, julianne. June 11th. Sorry? You wanted to know when my graduation was. Right, I'll be there. Good, and I will be there for your procedure. No, I really shouldn't have asked that. That won't be much fun. They're cutting you open. You think I'm gonna leave you alone? Thank you. Bye, daddy. Congrats on figuring out your phone. Bye. Emmett :So... Did Danny ever tell you that Paul hit him? No. Did you ever see anyone hit Danny? I never saw anyone else hit Danny. Why did you smash your computer, Tom? Did you ever see anyone hit Danny? I never saw anyone else hit Danny. Why did you smash... Did you ever see anyone hit Danny? I never saw anyone else hit Danny. [Line ringing] [Phone buzzing] [Phone continues buzzing]
