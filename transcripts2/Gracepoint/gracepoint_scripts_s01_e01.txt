 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Exhales] 
 [Groans] 
 Why didn't you wake me? 
 I did. You told me to go to hell. 
 Blueberry pancakes. 
 Mom, why are you here? 
 I told you you don't have to come make breakfast for us. 
 I wanted pancakes. 
 I'm not gonna make 'em just for myself. 
 I'm not complaining. 
 My alarm clock stopped. 
 Fuse must've blown. I'll check it later. I'm late. 
 Mom, I have a fever. 
 No. Go to school. Tell her. 
 That's her diagnosis, a hand on my head? 
 Yeah, mom's in charge. 
 I got to go. 
 Did you see Danny? 
 He forgot his lunch box. 
 No. 
 He's probably at the wild life club. Got to go. See you guys. 
 Mark Solano, renewal check. 
 Hand delivery. 
 Two weeks late... I should've pulled your ad already. 
 You know I'm good for it. 
 Next check's due in five days. 
 Have a great day, Kathy. 
 Don't cross her. She'll crack the whip, man. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It'd be interesting, though, right? 
 So where's she sending you? 
 Field day at the school. 
 You want to lay down some money on the egg toss? 
 No, no, I think your boss just cleaned me out. 
 Right. All right. 
 Have a good day, all right? 
 Take care, Owen. 
 Watch your back. Watch your back. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How was your vacation? 
 Not long enough. 
 Two weeks isn't long enough? 
 Not when it's her first day back at work. 
 I like vacations. I'm good at vacations. 
 Hey. 
 So you getting ready for field day? 
 Can you do me a favor and tell Danny that his mom's got his lunch box? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Good, good. Good. 
 See you later, Mark. 
 Yeah, see you guys. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey, Mark. 
 Hey, Beth told me that you were going to the kids' soccer game. 
 Oh, yeah, sorry. I got caught up in something. 
 Oh, don't worry about it. We won it anyway. 
 5 to 2. Well, save your prayers, huh? 
 [Laughs] 
 So when am I getting that free dinner, huh? 
 I fixed your boiler. 
 Well, you have to have class to eat here. 
 Oh. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Yeah, I'm nothing but class. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Hey, you dropped your wrench. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 This place is falling apart. 
 Yeah, tell me something I don't know. 
 [Horn honks] 
 Buddy. You're late. 
 Yeah, traffic was hell on the highway, man. 
 Yeah, got all those tourist girls, huh? 
 They're after you, Vince. 
 Hey, uh... You get a chance to think a little more about that raise? 
 What, borrowing my van isn't enough? 
 Just keep driving. 
 I am back. I have returned. 
 That's right. Vacation is over. 
 We are now living the dream once again. 
 So what's been going on? 
 Ellie. 
 Yeah. 
 My office. 
 Ellie, we hired someone else. 
 What? 
 I knew you'd be disappointed. 
 But you said the promotion was mine. 
 You said it could wait until after my vacation. 
 The situation changed. 
 Well, who... who did you give it to? 
 His name is Emmett Carver. 
 A man. 
 Huh. 
 So what happened to, "we need women in more positions of authority in this department"? 
 He has a lot of experience. 
 When does he start? 
 Last week. 
 It's over this way. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Must've cut the fence right here... And made their way into the woods. 
 You hear any shots? 
 My wife thought she did, middle of the night. 
 Season hasn't started yet, but permits or no permits, I don't want these guys on my land. 
 Someone'll call you. 
 Well, that's it? 
 You're just leaving? 
 We'll send someone out. 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Go for yeaton. 
 Call me out 7:00 in the morning for that? 
 Just serving the community. 
 We got another call. 
 Lifeguard saw something down at the beach. 
 After everything he said, I should just clear my desk off, and I should just go. 
 I know, but it's... when I walked back in, I felt... I felt good. I felt... I felt ready to go. 
 [Knock on door] 
 I am in here! 
 Ellie... 
 What? 
 Call's come in. 
 [Cheering and shouting] 
 [Eerie music] 
 Show me the gold, all right? 
 Three, two, one. 
 There you go. 
 Hi, James. How are you? 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, Beth. 
 Hi, Lana. 
 Hey, is Danny okay? 
 What do you mean? 
 He didn't come in this morning. 
 Yeah, he did. 
 No, we haven't seen him today. I figured he was home sick. 
 Danny, it's mom. You're not at school. Call me now. I want to know where you are. 
 Jack, hi. Hi, Beth Solano. 
 Danny was with you today, right? Counting the... Oh, okay. 
 And... and he didn't call to say he wasn't gonna be in? 
 No, no, no, no. We're good. Just not sure where he is right now. 
 Mark, it's me. Call me now. 
 Did Danny tell you he was going anywhere today or with anyone? 
 He had his wild life shift, but I thought he'd be here. 
 Okay, all right. 
 Thanks, Tom. You can go. 
 Call me if he shows up. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Rush hour traffic... Don't you just love it? 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Horns honking] 
 Traffic is backed up, causing a bit of congestion. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Dj speaking indistinctly] 
 We've got all the news right here. 
 Don't go away. 
 [Horns honking] 
 Sorry, excuse me. Do you know what's going on? 
 Cops at the beach. Heard they found a body. 
 [Dark music] 
 [Sighs] 
 Don't do this to me. 
 Oh, God. Oh, God. 
 Back behind the tape, ma'am. 
 No! 
 This area's restricted. 
 No. 
 I'm a cop. 
 Seriously? 
 I know this boy. He lives here. 
 He's my son's best friend. 
 Calm down. 
 You don't understand! I know this boy. 
 Enough. Shut it down. 
 Shut it down? 
 You're working a case now. 
 Carver. 
 I know who you are. 
 You took my job. 
 Wow, you want to do that now? 
 You don't even know this kid. 
 So tell me. 
 Danny. Daniel Solano, 12. 
 He goes to school with my son Tom. 
 His mom, dad, and his sister Chloe, they live here in town. 
 His dad is the local plumber. 
 Is this a suicide spot? 
 No, he wouldn't do that. 
 Answer the question. 
 No, it is not a suicide spot. 
 He's not that kind of kid. 
 Where the hell are the crime scene guys? 
 [Beth panting] 
 [Eerie music] 
 [Indistinct announcement over megaphone] 
 Sir, if you'd listen, there's been an incident on the beach. 
 You need to stay back for now. 
 Now, we'll let you know... 
 Ma'am. 
 Ma'am! 
 Hey, hey, ma'am! 
 Who the hell's that? 
 No, no, no, no. No, Beth, Beth, Beth, you can't be on the beach. Stop, please. 
 Danny has those sneakers. 
 I know. I know. I know. 
 Get off of me! 
 No, let her go. Let her go. 
 Get off of me! 
 [Melancholy music] 
 Ladies, gentlemen, you are looking at a survivor of the Gracepoint Elementary School field day. 
 Let me tell you something. It was epic. 
 Hope you got the right spellings for those kids. 
 Not gonna get chewed out by parents again this year. 
 Look at the little jocks. 
 It's Jamie from the Crab Shack. 
 She said the police just shut down the beach. 
 Huh. Want to go check it out? 
 Or stay here and edit pictures of kickball? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay, I'll go to the beach. 
 People just walk along here without a fence? 
 Yeah, they know how to be careful. 
 Hi, Hugo Garcia. 
 Talk to me. 
 This is Detective Carver. 
 He's new. 
 Okay, then. 
 The rock fall around the body was faked. 
 What do you mean? 
 Angle of the body was wrong for a fall, too arranged. 
 And up here, there's nothing. 
 No footprints, sneaker Marks. 
 Flattened grass, no slippage. 
 No loose rocks, no fibers, no hand marks. 
 He didn't fall from here. 
 Could he have jumped? 
 Not to where the body was found. 
 Trajectory doesn't match. 
 Not a suicide. 
 My guess... Someone wanted to make it look like an accident. 
 But that kid wasn't up here. 
 Call the M.E. tell him I want details. 
 Even if it's just preliminary. 
 Okay. 
 Ellie! 
 Who's that? 
 Aunt Ellie! 
 Just get in the car. 
 Aunt? 
 I've told you not to do that. 
 Owen Burke, Gracepoint Journal. 
 Why's the beach... 
 Get out of here. 
 I got nothing to say to you. 
 I heard there's a body. Have they identified it yet? 
 Owen, we'll give a statement when it's appropriate, okay? 
 Okay. 
 I want to tell them. 
 No. 
 You don't know this family. 
 How many deaths have you worked? 
 This is my first. 
 You can't make it better for them. 
 You don't know how I work. 
 Most likely, it's abduction. 
 Was he taken? Who by? 
 Watch them, everyone in the room. 
 Every movement. 
 Anything that doesn't make sense, tell me. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Don't look at me like that. 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Shh. 
 [Knock on door] 
 [No audible dialogue] 
 Why don't you take a seat? 
 Okay. 
 Come on. 
 A boy's body was found on the beach... 
 It's Danny. 
 This morning. 
 Babe, let him talk. 
 I saw his sneakers. 
 Let him talk. 
 We believe it's Danny. 
 Is it, Ellie? 
 [Beth cries] 
 Dad. 
 [Cries] 
 [Sobbing] 
 It's all right. 
 [Both sobbing] 
 [Weeping] 
 Thanks a lot. 
 It was an accident, right? 
 Right now, it's unclear. 
 How's Danny been lately? Anything bothering him? 
 Well, he didn't kill himself. 
 When did you last see him? 
 Um... I checked on him... Last night just before 9:00. He was in his room reading. 
 What about this morning? 
 He was out early. He's part of a wild life group. They go out to osprey point in the morning to record the sea life. 
 They? 
 Jack Reinhold... He runs the kayak shop. He's the... The town's wild life recorder. Has been for years. He lets the local kids help out. 
 Jack told me that Danny didn't show up this morning. 
 Any forced entry, disturbance around the house? 
 I want to see the body. 
 You might be wrong about it being him, and I want... I want to see. 
 [Somber music] 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Can I touch him? 
 Look at you. 
 [Murmurs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry that I wasn't there to protect you. 
 I'm never gonna forgive myself. 
 Okay. 
 Well... 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Sniffles] 
 We're gonna catch whoever did this. 
 I promise. 
 I love you, Danny. 
 I love you. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Melancholy music] 
 [Fog horn blares] [Bell dings] 
 Was the kid abducted? 
 Did someone gain access to the house? 
 If so, how? 
 If not forced entry, who has keys? 
 The family... What do we know? 
 Beth and Mark, childhood sweethearts. Beth had Chloe when she was 17. 
 I meant last night. 
 Okay. 
 Beth and Chloe watched TV. They did not leave the house until this morning. 
 Mark was out on an emergency call. He's a plumber. He got back around 3:00 A.M. 
 Nobody checked on Danny after 9:00 P.M. 
 Grandma lives nearby, and she was in all night. 
 I'll make a statement to the media later. Till then, everything stays between us. No gossip, no briefing, you understand? 
 Yeah, I think we all know how to do this. 
 There's gonna be some heat around this case. 
 We don't typically see crimes like this, so it's gonna attract attention. 
 I'm suggesting you hand this off to detective Miller. 
 No. 
 Look, given the specifics of the case, we don't want Rosemont to become a distraction for you as much as anyone. 
 I was fully exonerated. 
 You came here to lie low. 
 I came to do a job. 
 Rosemont doesn't make me vulnerable. It makes me the best cop you could hope to find. 
 Right now, I got people to interview. 
 
 
 
 What did the chief want? 
 What? 
 Well, you were just walking with him. 
 No. 
 No? 
 Yes, you were. 
 Your son, Miller. 
 He and Danny were friends. Does he know yet? 
 No, of course not. 
 I need to talk to him. 
 Tomorrow. I'll tell him tonight. 
 And you know what? I... I would prefer that you didn't call me Miller. 
 Why? 
 I don't like the last name thing. It's just Ellie. 
 Ellie. 
 Ellie? 
 Yeah. 
 No. 
 Mr. Jack Reinhold? 
 [Grumbles] 
 I rent kayaks and bikes during the season, and the rest of the time, I... I record the sea life... The whales, otters, seals, and submit them to the marine reserve. You know, we're smack in the middle of a gray baleen migration as we speak. 
 Gray baleen migration. 
 15,000 whales started back north for the summer. 
 You didn't know that? 
 Strangely, it had escaped my attention. 
 He's, uh... He's from the city. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 Danny's mom said he was here every... every morning this week? 
 The kids come here throughout the year. 
 They take turns to go out and record sightings with me. 
 You know, it makes them aware of the environment, our relationship to nature. They need to know this stuff. 
 But he did not show up today. Is that correct? 
 Figured he was sick. 
 You didn't call his family to check? 
 You think he's the first kid to miss a morning? 
 Has he ever missed days before? 
 No. 
 You married? 
 No, are you? 
 What can you tell us? 
 Injuries don't point to a fall from that height. 
 Cause of death: Blunt trauma. 
 One blow to the head, harsh blow. 
 The kid was facing his attacker. 
 He would've looked him in the eyes. 
 Any sexual violence? 
 No, thank God. 
 Time of death? 
 Between 10:00 P.M. Thursday night and 4:00 A.M. Friday morning. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 You may be used to this, but we don't get these around here. 
 You find this guy, you lock him up for a very long time. 
 [Solemn music] 
 [Knock on door] 
 We have an update for you. 
 Preliminary findings means we're now classifying this death as a suspected homicide. 
 I should've checked on him before I went to bed. 
 If I'd checked... 
 No, Beth, Beth. This isn't your fault. 
 Whatever happened, you are not to blame. 
 I swear, we will find the person responsible. 
 You have my word. 
 Okay? 
 I just need to eat. 
 Low blood sugar. 
 Do you think other kids are in danger? 
 Maybe. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Melancholy music] 
 Want me to do it? 
 [Eerie music] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 This is Ellie. 
 Is it Danny Solano? 
 Owen, hang up. 
 You know I can't talk to you. 
 I just saw Chloe at the beach. 
 She was leaving a stuffed animal. 
 This is not appropriate. 
 Oh, my God, poor kid. 
 I did not confirm that. 
 Thanks, I got to go. Bye. 
 Owen. 
 Owen! 
 Hey, this is Owen. Leave me a message. 
 Owen, you had better answer my calls. 
 You do not speculate, and I'd... 
 You better call me back. 
 Hey, Renee, I got something for you. 
 12-year-old kid found dead at the beach at Gracepoint. 
 It's a small town halfway between here and the Oregon border. 
 Likely homicide. 
 Send me the link. 
 It's yours. 
 [Dark music] 
 Here, sweetie. 
 Here you go. 
 We're taking Danny's computer. 
 Will you tell us if you find anything on it? 
 That's really not up to me, Mrs. Solano. 
 They released his name. 
 Did you agree to that? 
 Wait, agree to what? 
 It's online from the Gracepoint Journal. 
 Daniel Solano. 
 Everyone knows it's us now. 
 Why did you do that? 
 You need to talk to Detective Carver. 
 No, we're talking to you. 
 And how do you know about it anyway? 
 I got an alert on Gracepoint and death. 
 Chloe. 
 Lucky I did, or we wouldn't know. 
 Know what? 
 Who told that journalist? 
 That family's lives are destroyed, and then we screw up and make it worse! 
 Why the hell should they trust us now? 
 Who was it? 
 There... [clears throat] There was an assumption made. 
 Your nephew? 
 He called me and he said he saw Danny's sister leaving a toy of his behind at the beach. 
 I did not give any confirmation. 
 I told him not to publish. 
 I will talk to him. 
 I will explain everything to the family. 
 Go away. 
 Son... of... a... bitch! 
 [Groans] 
 Hey, Nick. 
 Ellie. 
 At 6:52 A.M. today, the body of a 12-year-old child was found on north beach here in Gracepoint. 
 Deceased has been identified as local resident Daniel Solano. 
 The family has been notified, and a homicide investigation is now underway. 
 A full media briefing will follow this evening. 
 We ask you to respect the family's privacy at this difficult time. 
 Do you have any suspects... 
 No questions now. Thank you. 
 You know that guy? 
 He was a detective in Rosemont when I was on the paper there. 
 I can't believe he got hired again. 
 Boss. 
 Suspected homicide. 
 Kid in a small town couple of hours up the coast. 
 Gender, age? 
 Boy, 12. I want to go up... 
 Wrong gender, wrong age. Too far, cost too much. 
 Just take what the locals report and Polish. 
 Come on, all I'm doing right now is polishing press releases. 
 And I've got an angle on this story... 
 I like your drive, clemons. 
 Let's not waste it on this one, huh? 
 Hey. 
 Long day. 
 Right. 
 It is so tragic. 
 I can't image what that family must be going through right now. 
 Everyone's in shock. [Sighs] 
 And do you think that the beach will be closed tomorrow? 
 I mean, just so I know what to tell my guests. 
 I don't know. 
 Only I've had one room check out early and an email cancellation just tonight, so I... 
 I'm going up. 
 Oh, I forgot there are people waiting for you in the bar. 
 Speak. 
 I'm an idiot. 
 I shouldn't have posted Danny's name. 
 I apologize. 
 I've made it clear... another move like that, he'll be singing at least a whole octave higher. 
 All reporting comes through me now. 
 The journal works with the police. 
 I'll talk to Mark and Beth, give them our apologies. 
 Stay out of my way. 
 Hey. 
 There she is. 
 Mommy. I told you she would come. 
 Hey, there you are. And you're eating spaghetti... And you're wearing it too. 
 Good job. 
 [Kissing] 
 You okay? 
 Hanging in there? 
 I just... I actually have to go back. 
 I just came home to shower and just kiss these boys. 
 Where's Tom? 
 Upstairs. 
 Okay. 
 He doesn't know, does he? 
 Not yet. 
 I kept him away from it all. 
 Okay. 
 You know what happened? 
 Should we be worried for the kids? 
 I don't know. 
 I... [Sighs] I should go talk to Tom. 
 [Sighing] 
 Sorry about the job. 
 Who cares? 
 How's the new boss? Is he okay? 
 [Cries] 
 Hey, come here. 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 I can't do this. I can't do this. 
 I keep thinking that... That he's gonna walk back in. 
 Every time I hear the phone ring, I think... I think... I think it's Danny. 
 Why didn't you check on him last night? 
 Hey, Beth... You always check on him when you come to bed. Why didn't you see he was gone? 
 Why didn't you? Where were you last night? 
 I told you. I was working. 
 You know Danny wasn't at school today, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Danny died last night. 
 How? 
 We're not sure. 
 He was found lying on the beach early this morning. 
 Does his mom and dad know? 
 Yeah, they do. 
 Listen, when something like this happens, it's... It's impossible to know what to do or how to feel, especially when it's your best friend, so you can be sad. You can be really angry. You can be confused. It's okay to cry. You can do whatever you need to do, okay? 
 Will the police need to... Will the police want to talk to me? 
 They probably will, but I don't... I don't want you to think about that right now, okay? 
 Can I be alone now? 
 Of course. 
 [Dark music] 
 Thanks for bringing me. 
 Of course. 
 Sure you want to be here? 
 I used to drive down here with him when he was little, a year maybe. 
 Middle of the day, just me and him. 
 I'd dip him in the waves and sweep him up. 
 [Laughs] 
 Tiny, fat legs all wet. He loved it so much. 
 He would just squeal with excitement. 
 I used to do the same thing with Tom. 
 Does Tom know? 
 Promise me, Ellie, because I don't know your boss. 
 You and me, we go back. The boys go back. 
 I'm relying on you to catch them. 
 I promise you, Beth. 
 I promise. 
 He did know, didn't he, that I love him? 
 Of course he did. 
 You are a beautiful mother. 
 You can't doubt that. 
 I feel so far away from myself. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Owen speaking. 
 Hi, Owen speaking. 
 This is Renee Clemons from the San Francisco Globe. 
 I saw you broke the story about Danny Solano. 
 You saw that, did you? 
 Listen, I was hoping for a hotel recommendation in Gracepoint. 
 You expect me to help out a reporter from a rival newspaper? 
 I'll assume you're kidding. 
 Yeah, well, listen, I don't really care, but I'm not so sure about my boss. 
 What, are you in town already? 
 Yeah, I'm down at the beach. 
 People are already leaving flowers. 
 Danny's sister left one of his toys there. 
 That's probably what started it. 
 Check out the Crestview Inn. 
 You know, it's nothing fancy, but it's solid. 
 And just tell Gemma you know me. 
 She'll give you a good rate, okay? 
 I'll do that. Thanks. 
 Maybe see you around. 
 Yeah, maybe you will. 
 Who are you setting up at the Crestview Inn? 
 Just a girl. 
 Woman. 
 Woman. 
 Not gonna tell me more than that? 
 I'll tell you more if there's more to tell. 
 Okay, press briefing at the school. 
 Good luck or... 
 I know. 
 [Dark music] 
 Press briefing in half an hour. 
 Look at this, security camera from Ichabod's last night. 
 I called every business on main street to see if they had a security camera running. 
 Is that Danny? 
 Matches his clothes, height. 
 Even looks like his skateboard. 
 Danny wasn't abducted. 
 He snuck out. 
 Why? Where was he going? Who was he meeting? 
 And where's his skateboard? 
 Oh, and I also went through a list of his possessions. 
 No cell phone, and I know he had one. 
 He and my son tom, they texted each other constantly. 
 But it's not there? 
 Nope, not from his body or from his home. 
 Check with the family. 
 Nice, Miller. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Let me hand this over to Detective Carver, who can answer any specific questions. 
 Kathy. 
 What advice do you have for people in the town, particularly parents? 
 The crime rate here is one of the lowest in the state. 
 This is a terrible, uncharacteristic crime. 
 Um... We're in the early moments of what may be a complex investigation. 
 Danny's life touched many people. 
 We'll be looking at all those connections. 
 If you or someone you know has any information, has noticed anything unusual, please come forward now. 
 I'd urge everyone: Don't hide anything, because we will find out. 
 If a member of your family or a friend or a neighbor has been behaving differently in the past days or weeks, please tell the police immediately. 
 There will be no hiding place for Danny's killer. 
 We will catch whoever did this. 
 [Camera shutter clicks]
