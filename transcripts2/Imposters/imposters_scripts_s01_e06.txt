 Patrick Campbell could be one of our biggest scores. 
 The numbers aren't good. They are amazing. 
 Not in a million years, Max. 
 Oh, yes, you most definitely will. 
 The payoff is huge. 
 What's the payoff? 
 We get to live. 
 If you ever go to the police or try to find me, everyone in the world will know what's inside that folder. 
 I bet whatever's in your folder is way worse than what's in mine. 
 I have literally no idea what you're talking about. 
 Yeah, me neither. 
 Ready to go? 
 We were never going to run. 
 You need to stop saying "we." 
 Rules of the game, Sal. 
 You broke 'em. Maxie. 
 This is your ex-wife. 
 Your shape-shifting, money-stealing, professional con artist ex-wife, and mine, and his. 
 Guys, we need a Maddie code. 
 No alone time. 
 No contacting her on our own. 
 All: No s*x. 
 I'm gonna throw you one kick-ass birthday party. 
 I hate birthday parties, always have. 
 Until you met me. 
 Ez. 
 Hi, Ava. What are you...

 Fine, I'll start. You found me, congratulations. 
 That's right. We did. 
 Yeah, and we're not leaving until we get what we came for. 
 What'd you come for? 
 Don't you wanna know how we found you? 
 Why don't you just tell me what you want? 
 You stole our money. Yeah, that's right. 
 You can't just take people's money. 
 You didn't just steal our money. 
 You took... our dignity. 
 Wrong. No one can take that from you unless you give it to them. 
 Anything else? 
 Yeah, you at least owe us some answers. 
 I don't have any answers. 
 Well, you haven't heard the questions yet. 
 Let me guess. 
 How could I do this to you? Right? 
 Or better yet, "Why me?" Yeah, exactly, why us? 
 Because it's my job. 
 It's what I do. 
 And because you let me. 
 [scoffs] 
 Um... [chuckles] 
 Okay, we're willing to cut you a deal. 
 A deal. Mm-hmm. 
 There's no deal to be made because there is no money. 
 Uh, what about everything you stole from us? 
 It's gone. 
 It's gone? Yep. 
 What, it's just gone? 
 That's right. Okay, bullshit. 
 We're entitled to the truth. 
 You want the truth? Yeah. 
 And we're not leaving until we get it. 
 Okay. 
 Here's your truth.

 If I screw up this job that I'm doing right now, if you screw it up for me, then he is going to kill me. 
 He's going to kill me in a very slow, painful way. 
 Who are you talking about? 
 What, you think I do what I do all by myself? 
 All right, so, here's what's gonna happen. 
 I'm going to get up, and I'm gonna walk out that door, and then each of you are going to turn around and go back to your lives because if you don't, then I'm quite literally a dead person. 
 And then all of you are not far behind. 
 There's your truth. 
 What just happened? 
 Ava... get out, let me out! What are you... 
 Maddie, wait!

 Well, either call that gentleman and tell him you'd like to thank him in the flesh or give me his number. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 How soon can we get out of this goddamn bank? 
 Whoa. Whoa, hold on. 
 Look, Max. 
 This morning at the diner... 
 I just... I can't... I can't work here anymore, okay? 
 I thought after Heller was, you know, gone that they'd let me go.

 Yeah. [chuckles] 
 I sure didn't expect all of this.

 Is my brother being a pain in the ass again? 
 No, no, he's a funny guy. 
 You know, it's nice to hear some things about your childhood.

 Well, a cult would've been a lot more interesting than Pottsville. 
 Pottsville? Where's that? 
 Pottsville, Pennsylvania, hometown. 
 Wait, I... I thought Cincinnati? 
 It's Cincinnati. 
 Right, we're originally from Cincinnati... 
 Right. But our uncle got sick, and we moved to Pottsville. 
 Uncle Sam. And let me tell you, Pottsville had never seen anything like Saffron. 
 Stop. 
 When's... when's the last time you visited? 
 Ezra. No, no, no, it's fine. 
 You know, things are a bit tough back there, you know. 
 Our dad, his, uh... his memory's going down, you know, and, uh...

 People need to know who she really is. 
 Shh! No, don't you shush me! 
 She was my wife too, okay? I have things to say too. 
 Okay, okay, come on, come on. 
 All we had to do is keep our sh1t together for 30 minutes, Jesus! 
 No, I'm fine. Unbelievable. 
 What the hell? 
 You actually did the wig thing? Are you insane? 
 We came here to do a job, get the money, and run, remember? Is that what you were doing when you were dancing cheek to cheek with her? 
 Exactly, no one-on-ones, remember? 
 She asked me. 
 [whistles] 
 Mr. Ellis. Pops? 
 Señor Cisneros? 
 My name is Max. 
 I knew you weren't dead. 
 You're a bright kid. Wait, so you were working with her the whole time? Yeah. 
 So does this mean that you don't really think my art 
 "marries the playful subversivism of Duchamp with the sublime sensuality of Kahlo"? 
 How drunk is she? 
 Not... not enough. 
 Sit down, everyone. Now. 
 Do you know why you're here? 
 We're not here for any trouble, okay? 
 We just want our money. Wrong. 
 You came here to chase a phantom. 
 People do crazy things for love. I get it. 
 If they didn't, well, I wouldn't be in business. 
 But know this: there's no Ava; there's no Cece; there's no Alice; and there's no money, not now, not ever. 
 Says you. 
 I'm sorry? 
 "A," you're a con artist, so what you say doesn't exactly hold water. "B," we can blow the lid off this whole thing in five seconds flat... 
 Yeah. If you don't guarantee us a piece of the action. True that. 
 "A piece of the action." Mm-hmm. 
 At what price, hmm? 
 Are you willing to destroy your mother and bring down Bloom Boot & Heel in one fell swoop when I reveal to Mumsy that your father has a sweet little side dish named Chanterelle and that the entire family business is built upon a stolen patent? 
 Whoa, seriously? 
 And are you going to be able to live with yourself when your hometown finds out that you threw that interception on purpose to beat the spread? And for what, 10 grand? 
 That's pretty weak. 
 That money went to my mom. 
 Nobody cares, son. I knew it. 
 I knew you guys had your own secrets. 
 So it seems we're all con artists in our own way, aren't we? 
 And poor Jules... Do not go there. 
 Please don't forget that we have this information. 
 Leave town today, or we'll use it. 
 And my last and most important point: if anything interferes with Maddie doing this job, the people who sent her here to do this job, well, simply put, they will kill her, they will kill me, and, as far as you three bumblers go... 
 Hey, man, don't threaten us. I'm telling you... 
 Oh! Whoa! 
 [snap] [screaming] 
 And, oh, yeah, there's that. 
 Don't let me see any of you ever again.
