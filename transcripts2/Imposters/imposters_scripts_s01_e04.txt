 Previously on "Imposters"... 
 I answer the door and it's these two guys, and they're looking for Cece. 
 I am over her. 
 - I am fine. Oh! 
 This is my car! 
 With what I know about her and what you guys know about her, we might just find a clue to who she really is. 
 Guys, St. Agnes Academy in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. 
 This was her school. 
 Pottsville, here we come! 
 Yes! Yes! 
 Meet Gary Heller, managing director of the Pacific Bank and Trust. 
 I'm supposed to fall in love with this guy? 
 His big hobby is darts. 
 [screams] Oh, my God! 
 Gary is a pussy, okay. 
 Keep talking, Freddy. Jesus! 
 Am I the only one who thinks there's something off about this job? 
 The only thing off is Maddie's focus. 
 We're right on schedule. 
 I told you, I'll close him tomorrow night. 
 Gary... Oh, no. 
 I don't want to rush things. 
 Kind of complicated. 
 Some things can be pretty simple. 
 All you have to do is be open. 
 I'm sorry, I just can't right now. 
 Is she getting distracted? 
 Maybe I should send Lenny Cohen. 
 [shouts, grunts] 
 There's no need for Lenny Cohen.

 I pump-fake once... defenders bite. 
 I cut back right, and boom! Ow!

 Are you sure this is it? 
 It just looks so, like, out of a horror movie. 
 It has to be it. 
 It's the only Jonsons in the phone book... 
 Arlen and Margaret. 
 Maddie Jonson. That is so... 
 Maddie Jonson. 
 There's no "H" in Jonson. I've never seen that. 
 Maybe they couldn't afford it. 
 Man, she grew up here. 
 In this house. Played in that yard. 
 Yeah, man, how do you grow up in a place like this and become... her? 
 Shh, shh, hey look. 
 That's Maddie's mother. 
 Yeah. I think you're right. 
 She looks kind of sad to me. 
 She looks sad.

 You don't look anything like her. 
 How about... her? 
 I never looked anything like that. 
 Well, life goal: 
 "move to New York and become famous." That's good. 
 My goal is not to become famous. 
 Right. I wanted to be successful, sure, respected and admired for my work, but that's not the same thing as famous. 
 I think all Richard means is the less we have to make up, the better. 
 Yeah, so let it go. 
 Your name is Jennifer Sherman. 
 You were in the French club, just like Maddie, and president of the "no smoking" initiative. 
 Yeah, but what if Jennifer Sherman still lives here, or she's dead, or... Jenny, it's called research. 
 That's why God invented Facebook. 
 Guys... she's pulling in.

 ♪ ♪ Okay. 
 Let's make a plan. 
 So, question. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Why banking? 
 It's a living, and there are banks everywhere, so I could just pick up and go every couple years, if I wanted. 
 Yeah, but why would such a smart, beautiful woman always feel the need to keep moving? Who knows? 
 Maybe I'm running from something. 
 Hmm. Mm. 
 But seriously, don't you get lonely? 
 Always meeting people and then... moving on? Sometimes, but just because something's temporary doesn't mean it's not real. 
 [pop music playing] 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Anything. 
 Is it weird to not have to work? 
 Well, I do have to work. 
 Your story's changing. 
 [laughs] Well, wait, wait, wait. 
 Let me rephrase. 
 I'm not compelled financially to work... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But I have to work. 
 You know, I like to work, really. 
 Do things, learn things. 
 You know, I'm not great with idle time. 
 Really? 
 Family barbecues, fancy lunches with new pals... 
 Seems to me like you got it down, buddy. 
 [chuckles] 
 Well, maybe. Maybe, but I don't get to kiss my new pal. 
 Well, you can't have it all. 
 No, apparently not. 
 [laughs] 
 [pop music playing] 
 So what kind of feeling? I don't know. 
 But it's just, like the... It's all gone to crap. 
 Older people often feel that way, Meg. 
 I'm not an "older people." 
 Young people, they just see a world that is exciting and they can't wait to figure it out. 
 So they go and get tattoos and go on adventures. 
 Excuse me. 
 Mrs. Jonson? 
 Maddie's mom? 
 Well, could be. 
 And who are you? 
 Jenny Sherman. 
 I was in Maddie's year at St. Agnes. 
 We were in French club. We used to walk home together. 
 Oh, my. 
 You're Kelly Sherman's daughter, aren't you? 
 Yes, I am. 
 That was such a terrible thing with your mother. 
 I am so sorry. 
 What... what happened with your mother? 
 W-was it cancer, or a car? I-I can't remember. 
 Oh, honey. 
 You do not need to talk about this, okay? 
 Margaret, really. 
 So how is Maddie? She's busy. 
 Very busy. Barbara, can you finish? 
 How much longer? 
 Okay, thanks so much for your help. 
 I appreciate it. All right. 
 Jen, not good news. 
 The visas won't be ready until the day after tomorrow, so it looks like we're... 
 Oh, excuse me, ladies. 
 I'm sorry for interrupting. 
 This is my husband, Channing. 
 Channing, this is Mrs. Jonson. 
 Her daughter Maddie and I went to high school together. 
 Oh, wow. Yeah. 
 Hi. Hello. Evan. 
 That's your brother's name, right? 
 What's he up to? 
 Evan is still living with his girlfriend in Florida. 
 West coast. 
 He posts some gorgeous photos on Facebook. 
 So are... are you from around here, Channing? 
 Oh, I wish, but no. 
 We were actually supposed to fly to Havana today for a business conference. 
 Got waylaid with some visa issues. 
 So looks like we're gonna be stuck here for 36 hours or so. 
 I got us a room at the Shady Lane Inn tonight. 
 A little room with a twin bed. 
 Why don't you have them over for lunch? 
 You know, you can all talk about the old days. 
 Oh, that is so sweet of you... Oh, no. 
 We wouldn't want to be an inconvenience. 
 It'd be very good for you. 
 Her Arlen has been not well. 
 [chuckles] Not well? 
 That's one way to put it. 
 [sighs] 
 Oh, come over and... you can tell me stories about Maddie and make an old girl happy. 
 Well... Okay, yeah. 
 That'd be lovely. That'd be awesome. 
 12:30 sharp. You know the address, right? 
 And-and you two don't have any of those silly food allergies, or anything, do you? Because I cook what I cook. 
 And that's all that I cook. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Great. All right. Thanks, ladies. 
 We'll see you tomorrow. Bye. 
 Nice meeting you, Barbara. 
 Barbara, put your tongue back in. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Okay, Jenny, Channing, how'd you guys meet? 
 We met at our friend Ezra's birthday party. 
 Birthday party. We got the same gift for each other. Whoa, like fate. 
 Like, what was the gift? 
 Art book. Rothko. Scotch. Single malt. 
 Scotch. Roscoe's. 
 Wait, what? [laughs] What's Roscoe's? 
 Okay, very cute, but don't forget, God lives in the details. Oh, yeah? 
 I thought he lived in the Middle East. 
 Ooh, that's funny. You're funny. [laughs] 
 Okay, Jenny, what do you do for a living? 
 I manage an art gallery in Tucson. 
 I pick the artists and curate the shows. 
 Channing, w-what do you do? 
 I'm a two-term state senator. 
 Whoa! What? 
 That's not what we agreed on at all. 
 That's... Why not? 
 Alice and I used to... Because no one would believe you're a f*cking senator. What? 
 We need to stick as close to the truth as possible. 
 Fewer complications, fewer mistakes. 
 It's very simple. Whatever. We gotta go. 
 Okay. Back door. 1:15, sharp. 
 Don't forget. Jenny, Channing, you're a lovely couple. 
 Thanks. Good luck. 
 Oh, thanks, dearest. 
 What are you doing? Why are you touching me? 
 Opening the door for you, darling. 
 You're opening the door for me? 
 Come on, guys, don't be late. Do you see this fool? 
 And you always worry about her, Max. 
 You're with her all day at the bank. 
 Is she doing her job, yes or no? 
 Ah, I suppose she is. 
 But is her head in the game? 
 She said she's not messing around with this guy at the cafe but, Heller should have been closed by now. 
 It's the easiest mark we've ever had. 
 Maybe he's more complicated than he seems. 
 What do you mean? 
 What do we really know about Gary Heller? 
 Just what we have in the Doctor's file. 
 I got into his computer, but so far nothing much has turned up. What about you? 
 Did you find anything at the house? 
 No. Nothing. 
 Then what's the problem? 
 I don't know. 
 Just a feeling, I guess. 
 Keep wondering why the Doctor picked him. 
 You had a feeling. 
 You know, if everybody just did their jobs and stopped worrying about their goddamn feelings... 
 Feelings aren't always bad, Max, you know. 
 Sometimes they get hurt, but... 
 I'm talking about mixing feelings and work. 
 I know. 
 Look, I'm just saying... I'm serious. Stop it. 
 All right. All right. 
 We just have to land this guy. And soon. 
 We will, Maxie. 
 We always do.

 Lunch? Good. Nice. That's good. 
 I... um, I stopped by 'cause I got you this after our night together the other night. 
 I thought you might enjoy it. It's darts. 
 Handcrafted, not cheap like the ones at the pub. 
 Thank you so much. That's so thoughtful. 
 That's me, Mr. Thoughtful. [laughs] 
 We've been playing darts together at night. 
 I... I teach her how to play darts. 
 Do you play? Uh, once or twice. 
 I'm not good at it. Yeah. 
 Probably not a lot of time, huh? 
 'Cause you're in the gym, you know, pumping iron, getting swole and all that. 
 Swole, yeah. Something like that.

 You were just so incredibly rude to him. 
 Rude? You want to talk rude?

 Yeah, he's my friend, Gary. 
 He's my friend. 
 You've been here for, what, a month? 
 You're making a lot of guy friends, aren't ya? 
 Just because we had one awkward dinner and you grabbed my tit doesn't give you the right to be an asshole and embarrass me in front of my friends. 
 I mean, you can't just jam a dart in someone's face every time you don't like something, like some kind of Neanderthal.

 This is delicious. 
 You eat like an athlete.

 I bet you miss her. 
 Well, she visits at Christmas and we email. 
 And email, I mean, it's not like writing a real letter. 
 But it's better than nothing, I guess. 
 I mean, I... 
 I always found her so mysterious. 
 I think she was one of those people who lived in her head with her daydreams. 
 She didn't have many friends. Didn't go to dances. 
 I was always encouraging her and she'd nod then not much would ever happen. 
 Then she went off into the world and... 
 Well, sometimes it's like she was never even here. 
 It's like when people leave you, sometimes the memories just aren't enough. 
 You wish you could make more of them.

 Hello, Maddie. 
 I'm Lenny Cohen. 
 Hey. 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Of course. 
 Good. Let's eat. 
 Why am I here? 
 How did you get in? 
 Don't answer a question with a question. That's rude.

 I asked you. You tell me. 
 I'm really not sure. 
 Heller is... coming along. 
 You know, he's a bit more challenging than we expected. 
 Um, he's got a temper, let me tell you, but I have a calming effect on him, which is kind of the angle I was taking, you know, rather than just the obvious seduction, you know.

 Tell me about Patrick Campbell. 
 Oh. 
 He's a friend I made at the coffee shop across from the bank. 
 Yes, I know. 
 Tell me about him. 
 Not much to tell. 
 Nice guy. Nice family. 
 Smart. Oh. 
 You met his family? 
 I... met some of them at a barbecue he had at his house. 
 It was really lovely and harmless. 
 Hmm. I'm glad you think so. 
 The Doctor doesn't think so. 
 Doesn't think it's harmless to be spending time with someone who's not your mark. 
 The Doctor doesn't think it's harmless that while you're on the job, while he's paying you to do one thing, you're actually doing another. 
 Doesn't seem harmless to the Doctor at all. 
 Okay, I can understand how... 
 Are you f*cking him? 
 No! 
 Absolutely not. 
 Not even a little. 
 Not even a little? [laughs] 
 [laughs] 
 That's funny. 
 [laughs] 
 I mean, I just meant that... 
 You know what I mean. I just meant... 
 Does he want to f*ck you? 
 You know, he... he did want to get, uh, romantic, but I made it very clear that that was not going to happen. 
 You want to f*ck him? 
 [laughs] Why... why are we even having this discussion? 
 Handsome guy, smart, nice family... 
 Seems rather fuckable to me. 
 Well, I haven't and I'm not going to, so... 
 I asked if you wanted to. 
 More to the point, are you f*cking Gary Heller? 
 Not yet, no. Not even a little? 
 Does he want to f*ck you? 
 He seems interested, yes. 
 Well... [clicks tongue] 
 I heard he got upset with you today. 
 That was a work related misunderstanding. 
 I... I can assure you, it... it's really not a big deal. 
 Maddie, you're not doing your job. 
 It is a big deal. 
 That's not right. 
 I... I think that I'm... 
 Not even a question. 
 The Doctor sends me when people aren't doing their jobs, and... 
 I'm here, aren't I? 
 Yes. So one more time. 
 Why am I here? 
 Because I'm not... doing my job. 
 Yes. That's right. 
 Because you're not doing your job. 
 So I'm here. Okay. 
 And I'm going to stay here until you do do your job. 
 Okay. Stop saying "okay." 
 It's annoying. 
 You know what's great about the Doctor? 
 He really understands we all have our areas of expertise. 
 He's so good... masterful, really... [chuckles] at employing us to do what we do best. 
 And, Maddie, you are really good at your job. 
 (quietly) Thank you. That's nice to hear. 
 I also am really good at my job. 
 Yes. 
 Sure you are. 
 My job begins when you fail to do yours. 
 Yes? 
 Yes. [clears throat] 
 So let me say a few things to help you. 
 Everywhere you go, everything you do, everything you think should be about doing your job. 
 So land Heller. Go to bed with him. 
 Marry him. And disappear. 
 You know the game. 
 Just do your job. 
 Got it. And Patrick Campbell? 
 Not helpful to this goal. 
 So... lose him. 
 Understood. Start tonight. 
 Yeah, I will. 
 Of course. Good. 
 [laughs] 
 It's just, you don't want to see me do my job. 
 Mm-mm. 
 Let's not let it come to that. 
 Go on, sweetie, eat. 
 Ooh, smells good in here. 
 Hey, can we sit up in that cabin-y section? 
 It's so... Cabin-y? 
 Yeah. Yeah, she's not gonna be able to tell what it is. Like Tinder or something? 
 No. The app embeds a bug in the photo that will attach to the email. Right. 
 When Maddie opens it, the browser automatically finds the IP address and the location of whatever device is on the email. 
 So glamorous. 
 You look like a... beautiful sea captain up here. 
 Like a Viking princess or something. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Your waitress will be here in a moment. 
 Oh, hold up. You're not our waitress? 
 No, I've gotta go back to swabbing the deck over at the host stand. 
 Argh. That sucks. 
 All right, well, don't be a stranger, okay? 
 Come visit. 
 Does that bullshit actually work? 
 That's called being nice to people, all right? 
 You should try it sometime, Grumpy McPoutsAlot. 
 So once we have the IP address, we can always find her? Or at least her phone. 
 Wow. Cool. 
 Yet still no progress with jet packs. 
 "Thinking of you. Hey, sweetie..." 
 How do you know Mrs. J calls her "sweetie"? 
 It's in the other email. 
 "Drove past your old school today. 
 "Thought of you. Hope all is well so far away. Miss you. Mom." 
 Now we just have to wait for her to open it. 
 All right. Jesus, I'm starving. 
 God, that lunch was a crime against humanity. 
 No wonder Maddie never comes home. 
 Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Can we order? Thanks.

 [sighs] 
 So I had a shitty, shitty day. 
 How about you? How was your day? 
 Oh, fine. 
 You know, I clean the other house and then I clean yours. 
 Two houses better than three. 
 Drink. 
 Yes. 
 No, no. You've got to kill it. 
 Kill? Kill it. Like a shot. 
 One. 
 There you go. That's better. 
 [coughing] 
 So where is this other house? 
 This house you clean? 
 Oh, the Markinson house. Forest Avenue. 
 I don't know the Markinsons. 
 But you know, I think I'd like to. 
 Maybe I'll give them a call. Is that okay? 
 Of course. In my Apples phone in purse. 
 I get it. No. No, no, no. Sit. 
 Later. 
 We're having a drink. 
 Cheers. 
 Nastrovia. Whatever. 
 [grunts] 
 It's got to be strange cleaning people's houses. It's so intimate. 
 Not sure I'd like it. I don't know. 
 It's not so bad. It pays good... 
 You know, when my mother would leave the house... you know, I would never go through her stuff. 
 All the other neighborhood kids, they... 
 They'd go through their parents' stuff. 
 And now, you know what's funny? 
 Every day, I deal with people's money. 
 You know, it's just numbers, but it's like sneaking through their lives. 
 I can't imagine that. 
 Well, you go through strangers' houses. 
 I go through their bank accounts. 
 Who else gets to peer into the dark corners of our lives, huh? 
 I don't know. 
 What do you mean you don't know? 
 It's not complicated. 
 Who else sneaks around and looks at other people's stuff? 
 Oh, the dentist looks in our mouths. 
 Dentist, yeah. That's good. 
 That's intimate. 
 But you know who else is far more intimate? 
 The doctor. 
 Do you go to the doctor? 
 Of course, he's important. 
 Have you been to the doctor recently? 
 No, not in a while. 
 Do you work for the Doctor? 
 No, I don't clean any doctor's house. 
 Who are you? 
 Oh. [laughs] 
 Mr. Heller, I think maybe you are drunken now. 
 I go and I... 
 Stop! 
 Do you work for the Doctor, you Polish bitch? 
 No, sir. 
 Bullshit. 
 No.

 Okay, you ready? 
 Mm-hmm. Ready? 
 Yep. Do it. 
 Ahh! [laughs] 
 I hardly felt a thing! Yeah? 
 Getting good, Mr. Bloom. Getting really good. 
 Thank you very much. 
 What's up, guys Hey, man. Watch this. 
 Yeah, show me. 
 What? Did you just stick it in the hostess? Crude! 
 So what if I did? I don't believe it. 
 Oh, come on. You saw the way she was looking at me. 
 What was I supposed to do? What? 
 Where, in the... in the bathroom? 
 How do you even know? You just know, man. 
 You just know. And no, not in the bathroom, sicko. They got this little closet for their coats. Disgusting! 
 Oh, who asked you? 
 You know, for a wannabe artist, you certainly have a lot of hang-ups. 
 "Wannabe," are you kidding? 
 Guys, come on. Yeah, what hang-ups? 
 When's the last time you actually got some? 
 Like I'm gonna tell you. 
 Well, you're awfully interested in who I'm screwing and when, but you won't talk about it? 
 Can I show you the watch lift? Tell me. Tell me. 
 Cece was what, two years ago? 
 Was she the last time? I've been laid in two years. 
 I have! Okay. Sure, if you say so. 
 You guys need anything else? 
 Some dessert? 
 I think just the check. Thank you. 
 By the way, the service here was incredible. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, my God, he's like a boner with a body. 
 Now, that's funny. 
 [cell phone chimes] 
 Oh, my God, she opened it. 
 Is it working? What's happening? 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Seattle. 
 She's in Seattle. 
 Seattle? You're a genius. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Great job. So... no! 
 Away. All right. 
 So let's get that phone back to Mrs. J, pronto. 
 You promised, right? [groans] 
 What's the matter with you? 
 We're gonna need more money. 
 To pay for dinner? To pay for Seattle. 
 And everything we have to do there. 
 Maddie? 
 I'll make this right. 
 I promise. Good. 
 Because you'll be seeing me around until it's done. 
 All right? 
 All right.
