 - Previously on "Imposters"... You stole the patent for the Bloom heel from Uncle Joe. 
 And you've been cheating on Mom for 20 years with a woman named Chanterelle. 
 I mean, what is that? A mushroom? 
 Where'd you get this? - Eva left it in the freezer. 
 - Screw it. [crashing] 
 Poor schmuck. 
 That was quite a night. We should do it again tonight. 
 And then definitely Friday after your birthday party. 
 Oh, my God! I cannot believe my baby sister is turning 30. Happy birthday. 
 Hey, I have a question. 
 What the f*ck do you think you're doing here? 
 Not leaving until we get our money. 
 You came here to chase a phantom. 
 But know this: there's no Ava, there's no Cece, there's no Alice and there's no money. 
 Not ever. So you just throw your heart around like it's nothing. 
 Maybe it's different this time. 
 Maybe he's not just a mark. Thanks, Gaby. 
 You know I'd be lost without you. 
 You're welcome. Ezra! 
 Stop flirting and get your skinny ass in my office. 
 [both moaning] What's the matter? 
 Is this good? Maybe if you, you know, talked with an accent. Do you wanna make love to me? 
 What happened to your face? I saw Ava at the airport, - dressed as somebody else. I thought this weekend I'd take you for a little getaway. 
 Oh, my God. Don't you wanna know where we're going? Anywhere that's away with you is exactly where I wanna be. 
 He's an assignment, sweetie pie. 
 Yeah, the Doctor called it in. 
 He says that Patrick Campbell could be one of our biggest scores in years. 
 Not in a million years, Max. 
 This is the life we chose. There are rules. 
 We don't get to break them because we're stupid enough 
 - to fall in love. Man, she grew up here in this house, played in that yard. 
 Dad had a heart attack. You need to come home. 
 I really think it's a stupid idea. 
 She chose this life. Patrick didn't. 
 What if somebody could have come to you, could have stopped it? 
 I'm going.

 And they're probably onto my cousin and her pals. 
 So that's it. Any ideas?

 You have integrity. 
 You treat people well.

 You're not actually dying, are you, Dad? 
 That's very funny, Josh. You wanna know who's dying? 
 I'm dying! Come on, get with it! 
 Your mother and I have decided that we would like the two of you... with Gaby's help... to start taking over the family business. 
 What? 
 We thought you were never gonna leave. 
 Yeah, mostly because you said, "I will never leave. 
 They can wheel me out." 
 I had a change of heart.

 Sometimes the life you want is right in front of you. 
 You just have to see it.

 If you add it all up, Maddie could get 30-40 years in prison. 
 What about us? 
 They say we'll maybe do five. 
 Five years? Years. 
 Oh, my God. Yeah. 
 But there is one more thing. [sighs] 
 If we're willing to work with the FBI to bring Maddie to justice... 
 Mm-hmm. We could make a deal. 
 Okay. Do probation, not serve any time. 
 Could you do that? 
 Put the woman that you love behind bars? 
 Well, I'd know where she is all the time. 
 I could visit her. Bring her magazines. 
 Maybe she'd finally do crosswords with me. 
 She never would before. 
 And then maybe we could finally... 
 Yeah, stupid idea.

 Yo, I was thinking, because I'm older, I should have Dad's office and you should have Mom's. 
 You do know Mom's a year older than Dad. 
 Right, right. Hmm. 
 No problem. It's all yours. 
 For reals? Mm-hmm.

 Hey, Ezra the human, you wanna go walk Ezra the dog with me? Sure. 
 And around they go again. Both: Shut up, Josh. 
 So then he walks in the exam room and he's like, "Hi, I'm Dr. Sheffield, the vetinarian." And I'm like, "Oh, you mean the veterinarian?" Yeah. 
 And he looks at me like I'm pronouncing it wrong. 
 That's nuts. No, it gets crazier. 
 Later that day, I went to return a book and there was this woman that I didn't recognize sitting at the desk and she's like, "Hi, I'm Mrs. Jones, the new libarian." 
 No! Like, you have to be able to pronounce your own job. [cell phone buzzing] 
 It should be a requirement. Yeah. 
 At the very least. Uh, sorry. 
 My friends think they're being funny or something. 
 Oh, do you have new friends? 
 Uh, yeah. Wow. 
 You got a problem with that? No, it's just so fancy.

 It's pretty crazy about your mom and dad, huh? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Um, you know, Josh wants to do it and I think it could be really good. 
 It's just, um... What? 
 Part of me thinks I need to finish what I started with my so-called ex-wife. 
 Did you just roll your eyes at me? 
 Oh, sorry. I don't know what they're playing at. 
 You know what? What your dad said is pretty spot on, Ezra. 
 I hope it doesn't take you 30 years of whatever you're doing to realize what you have standing right in front of you.
