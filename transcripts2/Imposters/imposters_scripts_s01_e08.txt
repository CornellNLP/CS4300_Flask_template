 Previously on "Imposters"... 
 You're in way, way over your heads. 
 You're gonna get the hell out of Seattle, because if you don't, I am quite literally a dead person, and then all of you are not far behind me. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Uh, Federal Borough of Investigation. 
 Did you say "Borough"? 
 We just want our money. 
 Are you willing to destroy your mother and bring down Bloom Boot & Heel in one fell swoop? 
 And are you going to be able to live with yourself when your hometown finds out that you threw that interception on purpose to beat the spread? 
 Poor Jules. 
 Do not go there. 
 Don't threaten us, I'm telling you. 
 [grunts, screams] 
 We were never going to run. 
 You need to stop saying "we." 
 Maxy? 
 Rules of the game, Sal. 
 You knew 'em. You broke 'em. 
 Chin up, Max. 
 It's better to be sad than dead. 
 [tense music] 
 Dad had a heart attack. You need to come home. 
 Saffron Keyes, will you marry me? 
 No. I have a counter-proposal. 
 Let's run away together. 
 Patrick's in the FBI. No, he isn't! 
 I followed him to the goddamn headquarters, looked down on the goddamn seal, and it said Federal goddamn Bureau of Investigation. 
 Wait. What? 
 We need you back, like, now. 
 Okay, okay. 
 What am I doing here again? 
 Well, some information has come to our... 
 More importantly, what are you doing here? 
 Wasn't Max clear? 
 Danger for you. Danger for me. 
 Leave Seattle. Not that hard to understand. 
 You know, we didn't have to come here and tell you this. 
 We could've just left town with you in jeopardy. 
 I'm aware of the risks of my job, thanks. 
 Yeah. A different kind of jeopardy. 
 Yeah, that puts us in jeopardy, too. 
 Legally, maybe. 
 Probably. Definitely. 
 So, we decided that whether you deserve our help or not, not telling you would make us as unethical as you, which we're not. Indeed. 
 That's right. Ethics, Google it. 
 So, we're gonna tell you, okay? 
 Patrick's in the FBI. 
 [laughs] 
 What... what is that supposed to mean? 
 Which word didn't you understand? 
 So much for true love. 
 Patrick is in the Federal... 
 He's a Federal agent in the FBI. 
 You really think I wouldn't be able to figure it out if Patrick was in the FBI? 
 Current circumstances would suggest that no, in fact, you would not. 
 Because you have not. 
 Because it's wrong. It's not possible. 
 Oh, you just know him so well? 
 You guys are what, soul mates? 
 Okay. This is ridiculous. 
 Bye-bye, kids. I suggest you all... 
 Just shut up for a second and listen. 
 I followed Patrick into the Seattle headquarters of the FBI, where he used his f*cking badge to go through security. 
 And then I saw his little sister Gina and Auntie What's-Her-Face with their badges, dressed like legit freaking FBI agents.

 Finger's fine. Well, you heal fast. 
 That's a good trait. I hope you do, too. 
 Oh, I have an idea... Hey, hey, everybody calm down. 
 So, here we are. 
 And no amount of blaming or finger pointing or finger breaking or bullshitting is going to change the fact that we are all... all five of us... in the exact same boat. 
 We run, the Feds catch us, or the Doctor kills us. 
 Us? 
 You think the Doctor knows they're in Seattle? 
 I would imagine so, yes. 
 So, yes, us. We are, simply put, cornered. 
 Nice to see you, too. Who's got the cyanide? 
 I have a plan. 
 So, wait a sec. This Heller guy leaves, and then you guys decided to scam Patrick instead? 
 It's irrelevant. We should just focus on the job. 
 Kinda, yes. 
 "Kinda?" 
 Well, that's suspiciously inarticulate. 
 When Heller disappeared, the Doctor made Patrick the new mark. 
 He's very rich, and he was already on the hook, if you know what I mean. 
 Interesting. Why's that interesting? 
 Proof of life on Mars, I guess.

 Who'd you pretend to be when you conned my parents in Pottsville? 
 They have the look, don't they, Max? 
 They might, yeah. They just might. 
 What's the look? 
 Some people need the life. They've done something bad, or someone or something is chasing them. 
 Other people get a taste of the grift, and then they get hungry for it. 
 They like it. 
 Those people have the look. 
 So, let's not pretend we're not all up to the task. 
 Eyes on the prize. Agreed? 
 Good. 
 Max and I are going to teach you everything you need to know. 
 And then we take Patrick, we pay off the Doctor, and the FBI doesn't even know what happened. 
 Okay.

 Am I right? We're all in this. 
 We have to finish this. 
 Not for her, but... for us. 
 [sighs] 
 Got any quarters? 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh. 
 Stupid. 
 [laughing softly] 
 [coin clinking] 
 [sighs] 
 [sighs] 
 You know she's playing you, too, right? 
 You're not special. 
 I'm not special. 
 Richard... 
 Both: Definitely isn't special. [both laugh] 
 This is still a con, and we're all suckers. 
 Now we're just the suckers who are in on it.

 And? 
 Well, the wedding is on. 
 Ah, how great. Congratulations all around. 
 Well, I-I wanted you to be the first to know. 
 Dad, come on. It's starting. 
 I'll be right up, kiddo. 
 Anything else I need to know? 
 Uh, no, no. That's the report. 
 And I'll be getting back to you.

 Ezra Bloom, stop walking! 
 Hands up! Get your hands up! 
 Show me your hands, show 'em. All right, all right. 
 Go to the hood. All right. 
 Go to the hood. Get your head down. 
 I know Maddie Johnson had a plan to take all my money. 
 And I'm sure that you were hoping to get yours back after she stole mine. 
 But guess what? 
 I don't make that kind of money. 
 [exhales sharply] 
 Yeah. Bitter pill. 
 I knew you were bad news. 
 I told Maddie when I met you there was something about you that just didn't... 
 You told her what? 
 That I wasn't rich or handsome or charming as hell? 
 Screw you. I want a lawyer. 
 You got no idea what you stepped into here. 
 But you getting drunk and screaming to the world that Maddie is Saffron or Saffron is Maddie, and the sky is falling... 
 That doesn't help me do my job. 
 Why would I care about helping you do your job? 
 Whatever fantasy you have in your head about sticking by her side, and maybe she'll realize that you guys are meant to be... it's never gonna happen. 
 Maddie Johnson cares about one person: 
 Maddie Johnson. 
 She doesn't give a sh1t about you. 
 Meanwhile, I got you. 
 I got you on credit card fraud, I got you on identity theft, and I got you on petty larceny. 
 So, you are going to do whatever it is I need you to do to take her down. 
 Or you are going to go to big boy prison.
