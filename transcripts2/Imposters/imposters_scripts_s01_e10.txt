 Patrick's in the FBI. I followed him, and then I saw Gina and Auntie what's-her-face with their badges dressed like legit FBI agents. 
 It's complicated. [laughs] 
 Or maybe... not complicated. 
 [whispering] I slept with Gina. 
 You bedded an undercover agent? 
 [beeping] 
 - That's a saffron. Max is telling this story about this chick he was in love with and how she betrayed him and he had to give her up. 
 He said what? Max and I are going to teach you everything you need to know, and then we take Patrick, we pay off the Doctor, and the FBI doesn't even know what happened. 
 Let me see the art piece. 
 I switch out the real money with the fake money. Voilá. 
 What do you need? Answers. 
 Don't try to know me, Ezra. It ain't worth it. 
 What's your angle? Immunity. 
 I get you the Doctor, you get me someplace new to start over. Max, my right-hand man, you have to leave him alone for this to play out. 
 Maddie tells the Doctor they found the missing money, he comes to claim it. 
 Once he takes the bait, we've got our man. 
 This isn't over yet, Max. 
 I need you to keep up the good work. 
 Well, of course, Doctor. I'm your eyes and ears. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the Doctor is in.

 Man, I have always been good at this. 
 Remember when I showed up at your house with that FBI badge and totally fooled you? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, and I saw right through your ruse and punched you in the face? You mean you sucker punched me after I pinned your ass to the ground.

 Mm... Do you remember that? 
 Doesn't really ring any bells. No, I don't remember... ow!

 No, no, I'm not asking for excuses. 
 Just answer the question. 
 Why am I here? 
 Because I'm not doing my job.

 Excuse me.
