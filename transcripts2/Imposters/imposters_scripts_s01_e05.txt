 Previously on "Imposters"... 
 Yes, Doctor, we're on schedule. 
 I have a concern. 
 Is she getting distracted? 
 Are you attracted to me? 
 [laughs] 
 I almost jumped you at the coffee shop, first time we met. Oh. 
 I drive up and there's some strange guy here, touching your face. Just because we had one awkward dinner and you grabbed my tit, doesn't give you the right to be an asshole. 
 Maybe I need to send Lenny Cohen. 
 Hello, Maddie. I'm Lenny Cohen. 
 This is Florence Hayes, our new IT man. 
 It symbolizes what? The wanderer who finally stopped his wondering. 
 I did get this. [gasps] 
 Now we can track her through her IP address. 
 Oh, my God, she opened it. Is it working? 
 What's happening? Seattle. 
 She's in Seattle. We're gonna need more money. 
 Do you work for the Doctor? No, sir. 
 Ah! Mr. Heller? 
 [panting] 
 Get out of here. Get out of here. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 First dead body? 
 Yeah. 
 When's she getting here? 
 Soon. 
 She'll be here soon. 
 It's late for you to be out here, isn't it? 
 My dad said I'm allowed to patrol the alley. 
 Oh. Are you a good guy or a bad guy? I'm not a guy at all. 
 Fine. Are you a good girl or a bad girl? 
 Let me see. Is a shark good or bad? 
 Bad. Why? 
 Because it eats people. 
 So if you're a person, a shark is bad because it might eat you. 
 But if you're a shark yourself... 
 Say, a hungry little boy shark that likes to eat people for snacks... If you're bad, I have to smash you with my Hammer of Justice. 
 Oh, please don't smash me with your hammer of justice. 
 Are you good or bad? 
 What if I won't say? Or don't know? 
 Can your Hammer of Justice tell if I'm good or bad? 
 What? No. 
 My Hammer of Justice is just, like, my tool. 
 I'm Hammer Man. Hm. 
 Look... 
 Think about it this way, Hammer Man: 
 I'm a tool, too. 
 So what do I know about being good or bad? 
 You're no fun. Not true, Hammer Man. 
 First, I get to have so much fun. 
 I'm like the shark's teeth. 
 Or that Hammer of Justice you're holding. 
 Or maybe I'm like the fire that's burned since the beginning of time. 
 No one knows who started it, and no one can put it out. 
 But I get to be the fire. 
 So maybe I'm not good or bad. 
 I just am. 
 [gulps] Sorry. 
 Was that too poetic? 
 A bit forced? 
 All right. 
 Time for you to go home. 
 Look, I promise I'll keep an eye on the alley for you. 
 Okay? Go on home. 
 Go! Ah!

 Ouch.

 It kinda screams desperation, no? 
 Red works, okay? All right. 
 We pull off your little scheme, we'll be able to buy the tickets and have enough to live off of for a while, right? 
 My little scheme is actually quite elegant. 
 It's all about a synchronized execution of various...

 Where the hell's Sally? 
 Check if she got back to you, will you? 
 Nothing. 
 I don't know. Maybe she's asleep. 
 This is not good. 
 You think maybe it was someone at the bank? 
 I mean, we pissed off a lot of people. 
 Maybe someone over there... 
 Sally did this. Don't kid yourselves. 
 No, this is not Sally's style at all. 
 We shouldn't jump to that conclusion. 
 I'm thinking it, you're thinking it. 
 But... Occam's razor. 
 The simplest explanation is the correct explanation. 
 Sally found the Doctor's money under the floorboard. 
 Heller found Sally. Violence ensued. 
 Sally ran off with the Doctor's money. 
 What do you mean the Doctor's money? 
 Heller was laundering money for the Doctor. 
 He has been for years. And then he started skimming more and more and... How did you not tell me this? 
 How am I supposed to do my job? You didn't need to know! 
 If I don't know this kind of information... 
 No, you just had to land the guy, that's all. 
 Kids, shh! 
 I'm sorry that Heller was not exactly beloved, okay? 
 And if someone is holding some kind of a grudge and... and knew that he was keeping money here... 
 Sally's overcoat? 
 Yes. Hm. She left it in the hall. 
 And... [grunts] this, in our dead friend's fist. 
 It's her hair. 
 Same color, no? 
 Think it's a little bit of scalp in there. 
 Eyes on the prize. Scrub, scrub. 
 I'm gonna give the Doctor a ring-a-ding, figure out how to get you out of this ridiculous sh1t show you've got yourselves in. 
 Stay tuned.

 Go on, take a breath. Use your head, not your heart. 
 Hon, keep talking. 
 He liked darts. 
 Not helpful. 
 He had his gallbladder removed, liked dumplings... I don't... Charming. 
 [sighs] Max, your turn. 
 Well, thank you. 
 He had a bunch of kinda sad dating profiles. 
 And he was looking into Russian mail-order brides before Miss Saffron Keyes here waltzed into his life. 
 Mm. Much better. What else? 
 He was not well liked at work. 
 Because? 
 He was a dick. He could be a dick. 
 Hm. 
 It's getting better all the time. 
 Now here's the play: 
 We finish here. 
 You leave your scrubs and you go home. 
 Throw away the clothes you're wearing in the same bag as some kitchen garbage. 
 Whatever your day was supposed to be is still what your day will be. 
 You will go to work. 
 You will do all the things you would do if your boss didn't show up. Any word from Heller? 
 There's absolutely no way we can push that 10:00 conference call. 
 I left him a message at home and on his cell, but I'll try again now. 
 Well, let me know. Okay. 
 Please leave a message. [beep] 
 Hi, Mr. Heller. Just checking in again. 
 Your 10:00 call is still on, so let me know if you need anything at all. 
 [phone beeping] Max, check the hospitals. 
 Check her apartment. The number you have reached is no longer in service. 
 She's injured and scared. 
 But she's not in trouble. 
 Yes, I wonder if you could help me. 
 I'm looking for a woman who might have been treated at your facility at 5'7... 
 Find her. Don't let her leave. 
 It's only dangerous for her if she leaves. 
 This afternoon, a package from an associate of the Doctor's will arrive at the bank addressed to Heller, care of Saffron Keyes. 
 Here you go. It will contain everything we need to resolve the situation. 
 If you stay calm, if you keep your wits and do exactly as I say, all will be well. 
 Just do your job. 
 No, for a second, the card actually slipped out of my hand. 
 [laughs] It was like slow motion. 
 It was in the air and boom, I snatched it back. 
 Odell Beckham Jr. style. Whoo-hoo-hoo!

 Exactly. And that's why we have the code, and now we get to confront the real criminal, Maddie Jonson.

 What's the payoff? 
 We get to live.

 I figure you'll get engaged to him in what, six weeks, tops. 
 I mean, you're so hot for each other. 
 Married right away and 28 days later... 
 It's our lives, Maddie. [sighs] 
 So freshen up. Go back to work.

 What about her? 
 She made a big mistake and he'll find her. 
 Rest assured, the Doctor will find her. 
 And when he does... That's it? 
 You loved her. 
 Don't even try to tell me that you didn't. 
 And? 
 You love this guy Patrick. 
 Doesn't change anything. 
 And don't be arrogant. This is the life we chose.

 Now get going. 
 I'll see you in the game. 
 In the game. 
 Yeah, the mother-effing game.

 Wow. 
 Gary Heller in the wind, huh? 
 Yeah. I mean, I never liked the guy, but yeesh. 
 Yeesh, indeed, Mr. Wang. 
 Yeesh, indeed.
