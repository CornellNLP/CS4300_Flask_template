 After it ended, I couldn't get the clasp to open and just kinda got used to having it on. 
 - Boom. We are all... all five of us... in the exact same boat. 
 We run, the feds catch us, or the Doctor kills us. 
 I have a plan. 
 What do we do? 
 You will each have specific jobs. 
 - Pretty discreet, huh? Yeah, I'd never notice it. 
 I can't wait to make you my wife. 
 I can't wait to be your wife. 
 You'll be sorry if you marry her! 
 What the hell was that? 
 I thought he was working with her. 
 The whole lame brother backstory and everything? 
 This actually might be good for us.

 Stupid Dad. [laughs]

 Thanks. Oh, my God, he's like a boner with a body. Now that's funny. 
 What's your angle? Immunity. 
 I get you the Doctor, you get me someplace new to start over. 
 Ezra Bloom, my ex, Max, my right-hand man... 
 You have to leave them alone for this to play out. 
 Do we have a deal? I'm gonna need the ring.

 He was telling me this story about this chick he was in love with, and, I mean, the same sort of thing. 
 Some sh1t went down, she betrayed him or something and he found her at, like, a train station, about to leave town, but he had to give her up. 
 [ominous music] 
 He said what? 
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know the details, but it sounded really intense. 
 But that's what I have to do, right? 
 I mean, I have to give it up. 
 But hey, without pain, there's no wisdom.

 Hello, Doctor. 
 Here we go, Max. Are we ready? 
 Yes, Doctor, everything is on track. 
 Maddie marries the mark tomorrow, and after that, we'll follow our usual schedule. 
 Good. This is the big one, Max. 
 After the Heller fiasco, we have some ground to make up. 
 That seems doable, doesn't it? 
 Well, Patrick Campbell's numbers are excellent. 
 Don't worry. It's only bait. 
 We should all do very well. 
 This will be the biggest single score we've ever had. 
 And how 'bout Maddie? 
 I take it Lenny Cohen's visit got her back in line? 
 Oh, yes, Maddie's back to her old self. 
 Nothing to worry about there. 
 We're all having fun again. 
 All right, everyone, tomorrow's the big day. 
 Game time. Agent Simons. 
 Okay, everyone should know their jobs. 
 Let's go over it one more time, just in case. 
 Agent Anderson will be running... 
 And personally, I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. 
 Well, I'm pleased to hear that everything's back on track. 
 I'm promised you that I would take care of it, Doctor, and I did. 
 Hell, I would never let you down. 
 We hit some snags, but everything's going very well now. 
 This isn't over yet, Max. 
 I need you to keep up the good work. 
 Oh, of course, Doctor. I'm your eyes and ears. 
 Bye now. 
 Ladies and gentlemen... the Doctor is in. 
 12:00? 
 I deliver the art piece to the gift room. 
 Good. 12:15? 
 I make sure Max's car has a clear path out. 
 12:20? 
 I seat Max... I mean... the Doctor where Patrick has a clear view of him. 
 12:25? 
 The wedding starts, the song plays. 
 I hear the song, I start car number one, - and boom. Good. 
 Again. 12:00? 
 - I deliver the art piece. 12:15. 
 Make sure Max's car has a clear path out. 
 12:20. [continue indistinctly]
