 Previously on Cardinal. 
 I got a call about a possible missing person. 
 Prosecutor Robert Quillen. 
 His clothes are here. 
 His keys, wallet, a feather. 
 A man called, he said he knew who'd taken Robert. 
 Wade Kleiss. 
 Where's Robert Quillen? 
 Put him in interrogation. No stops. 
 You gotta get me outta here. 
 So the partner kills Wade before he can talk. 
 Do you remember, I spoke to my old colleague in Toronto? 
 You got the job? 
 Do you wanna come inside? 
 Yeah. 
 Tell me what you want! 
 Why dress him in warm clothes before leaving him to freeze to death? 
 He wanted Robert to suffer. 
 Wade Kleiss was business, this is personal. 
 Still partially frozen, so all I can give you is an external right now. 
 How about a time of death? 
 An approximate one, based on the data from the video, the time he was found, if I knew air temperature, I could be more specific. 
 Yeah, we can check that. 
 But for now- 
 I'd say 15 to 20 hours before you found him. 
 Severe frostbite on his fingers, his toes. 
 He was out there for a while before he died. 
 And these injuries are consistent with steel cable ligatures. 
 He's dragging something heavy. 
 A log. 
 Made it quite a ways before he collapsed. 
 He would have been sweating, his boots were cut short, so the sweat froze to the cables and cut his skin here. 
 The more he dragged, the more he bled, the more skin he would've lost. 
 Anything else? 
 As soon as I can get fluids thawed, I'll get a tox screen to the lab. 
 Can you ask them- 
 To put a rush on it? 
 Yeah, I'll do my best. 
 This could be an artifact from freezing, but it looks like the skin around his lips was ripped off. 
 Consistent with duct tape being torn away? 
 That would do it. 
 Also, the ligatures around his wrists, a thin cable, a zip tie. 
 At this point, my opinion is that Robert Quillen died of exposure. 
 But, you see this here, this mark? 
 That looks like it came from a stun gun. 
 Poor things. 
 Winter hit us early this year, caught me off guard. 
 Help you find something? 
 I'm lookin' for a house plant, you know, somethin' to cheer the place up a bit. 
 How 'bout an orchid? 
 Okay. 
 I got a bad habit of killin' them though. 
 Keep thinkin' maybe, uh- 
 Thinkin' maybe this time will be different. 
 I think I got a pamphlet somewhere that oughta help. 
 My mother's the, uh, local orchid expert, she, uh, wrote up some tips. 
 It's interesting, isn't it? 
 The value we put on different life forms. 
 Like if I came in here to buy a puppy from you and I said that I was having a hard time keeping it alive, would you sell me another? 
 Oh, don't be too hard on yourself. 
 Orchid's can be tricky. 
 Uh huh. 
 You're very forgiving, Barry. 
 Oh, yeah, uh, twenty bucks. 
 You've been very helpful, thank you. 
 Good luck. 
 You, too. 
 It's the same person that killed Wade Kleiss. 
 Stun gun makes it look that way. 
 But with Wade, it was professional, efficient. 
 And with Robert Quillen, it was different, it was, it was like it was staged. 
 And based on the time of death, he made sure Robert was dead, well before he sent Sheila the video. 
 Well, if he was already dead, sending that video was about making her suffer. 
 Then she could be the target. 
 A politician, she said it herself, she has enemies. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 That's okay. 
 Ah. 
 Hey, Lise. It's been a while. 
 It's good to see you. 
 Good to see you. 
 Yeah? So, how's he doing up there. 
 He's good. Yeah. 
 Why? Yeah, Cardinal. 
 Doesn't look like he's been sleeping much. 
 Do you guys have an intense case going or something? 
 No, actually, it's been pretty quiet until this week. 
 He still hasn't sold the house. 
 Still living in that tiny apartment. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I worry about him all alone, you know? 
 Do you want me to say something? 
 Uh, no, no, no. 
 No? I will. 
 All right, yeah, bye. 
 Sorry about that. 
 Um, so, I'll go check in with my new Sergeant. 
 I'll meet you here in an hour? 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Good to see you. 
 How's school? 
 What did she mean, "new Sergeant"? 
 She's, uh, she's leaving. 
 She got a job down here. 
 Oh. 
 Uh, when is she going? 
 Soon. 
 You know, I was actually thinking of taking a semester off. 
 Maybe I could come up there for a while. 
 Uh, what for? 
 To hang out. 
 Help you figure out your living situation. 
 Kel- 
 I don't want you putting your life on hold for me. 
 Stop. 
 You're a part of my life. 
 You're the only family I've got. 
 Still don't know why you moved outta that place. 
 I just don't wanna be staying in the old house with people trooping through for showings. 
 Just seemed simpler. 
 Okay. 
 But when it does sell, what's the plan? 
 Where are you gonna go? 
 What do you want for lunch? 
 Italian? 
 Ummmm... 
 Say Italian. 
 No, say it again. Um... 
 Say Italian. 
 Italian? You want Italian. 
 Do I want Italian? Yes, you want Italian food. 
 Go put you feet up, Mom. 
 I'll put the kettle on. 
 Ever miss the city? 
 Maybe, if I left for other reasons. 
 What happened- 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 None of it's been your fault. 
 I don't know. 
 It's just, um- 
 It's hard for me to think of it that way. 
 Anyway, that was another life. 
 But you can start a new one. 
 We should get back. 
 Quillen, husband of Minister of Northern Affairs, Sheila Gagne, was abducted and later found frozen to death at a remote logging site earlier this week. 
 A suspect in the abduct- 
 Poor, Sheila. 
 You two were such good friends. 
 Are you ready to go, Mom? 
 No, I wanna take that bag of old clothes for donation. 
 I can't understand what's happening in this town anymore. 
 All these terrible people, doing terrible things. 
 Hi. 
 You've rearranged the pictures. 
 Who? 
 Yeah, they look better. 
 Everything was fine when I left last night. 
 Okay. 
 No. 
 How bad? 
 I'm leaving right now. 
 Mom- 
 There's been an emergency at work, heating system's out. 
 Oh, no, for how long? 
 I don't know. 
 I can, uh, drop you off at the church on the way but we gotta hurry. 
 You go, I'll get there on my own. 
 You sure? 
 Of course, I don't wanna hold you up. 
 I hope it's a quick fix. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 I was gonna tell you before all this started, I was offered a job in the city. 
 I took it. 
 When are you leaving? 
 Not until we're done with this. 
 How does your partner feel about it? 
 I think he's fine with it. 
 Well, it's the right move for you. 
 I'm just glad you're not leaving us yet. 
 No. 
 Wade Kleiss did three stints in two different prisons. 
 So, hundreds of potential associates? 
 I'm cross-referencing similar kills with everyone who did time with him. 
 No luck so far. 
 Uh, there's a memorial for Robert Quillen at Sheila Gagne's house tomorrow. 
 We'd like to go in case the killer shows up. 
 You two, attend. 
 McLeod, you'll be on surveillance outside. 
 Okay? 
 So, we found snowmobile tracks. 
 Are we still thinking that that's how Robert was taken out to the clearcut? 
 Well, I've been following all the calls on missing machines. 
 Could be looking for one of these, all these snowmobiles were reported stolen in the last six weeks. 
 Yeah, we know somebody that might be able to narrow that down. 
 They're all yours. 
 I wanna help, I do- 
 But I can't do that, 'til I get some kinda guarantee. 
 What if we add obstruction charges? 
 Randi, you know better than anyone that there are no guarantees. 
 But I promise I will suggest to the prosecutor that he go easy on you for the stolen snowmobiles. 
 Thanks, hun. 
 All right. 
 Why don't you just point to any that you're not familiar with. 
 Okay? 
 2562 Wayburn Drive? 
 Don't even know where that is. 
 2018, custom powder blue paint job with silver snowflakes, matching sled, stolen from a locked garage last Tuesday. 
 First, that's a real distinct paint job. 
 But people notice a flashy machine like that. 
 I wouldn't touch one like that. 
 It's too risky. 
 Thanks. 
 Any time. 
 Hey! 
 I'm Yvonne. 
 I'm the McDermotts' neighbour. 
 You must be their renter. 
 Neil, hi. 
 I knocked but I heard ya down here, so, consider this a welcome. 
 That's very kind. 
 Thanks. 
 They're outta town. 
 They just asked me to pop over, make sure you have everything you need. 
 Everything I need. 
 You got enough firewood? 
 Yeah. 
 They left me plenty. 
 I'm sorry, I gotta ask- 
 What brings you to Algonquin Bay the coldest month of the year? 
 Silence. 
 Okay, well, um- 
 I'm sorry I interrupted. 
 Uh, if you need anything I'm right over there. 
 That's good to know you're close. 
 Bye. 
 Bye, Yvonne. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 How are ya? I'm good, how are you? 
 Good, it's been a while. 
 Yeah. 
 Good to see you, Josh. 
 This is my wife, Julie. 
 Hi, Lise. Hi. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Oh, and this is Alex. 
 Pretty hard to see there, she's buried under about four layers. 
 Gosh, she's so cute. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, it has been a while. 
 Are you still working Major Crimes? 
 Ah yes, but I'm moving away soon. 
 New job. 
 Well, I'm surprised it took you this long. 
 I just mean that Algonquin Bay has always kinda been temporary for you, you never really seemed settled here. 
 You still working with your dad? 
 Yeah, you'd think he'd cut me some slack what with the baby, you know, no sleep, but he is, um- 
 Same old Ken. 
 Yeah. Great. 
 Well, I should go. I'm on shift. 
 Okay. Good luck. It's nice to see you. 
 Yeah. Congratulations. 
 Thanks. 
 Josh looks happier. 
 Yeah. 
 Any regrets? 
 I never wanted that life. 
 I should have told him that. 
 Ms. Gagne. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Yes, we felt that we should be here to see your guests. 
 Yeah, if anyone stands out. 
 I see. 
 Uh, I'll-I'll let you know. 
 I'm so sorry, please excuse me. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Anyone catch your eye? 
 Not yet. 
 Hard to believe the killer would miss all of this. 
 Just a word of warning, the OPD is getting pressure from the Attorney General, they're taking the death of one of their prosecutors pretty seriously. 
 You can tell them that we were, too. 
 You need a hand? Oh! 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I didn't mean to startle you. 
 It's Neil. 
 Uh, Barry's friend from work, Mrs. Leblanc. 
 Oh. 
 I don't remember ever hearing about you. 
 Are you having trouble with your scooter? 
 It doesn't seem to wanna start. 
 Hm. 
 You mind if I take a look? 
 Oh, please do. 
 I think the battery's dead. 
 It can't be, I just replaced it last month. 
 And I was only inside for half an hour. 
 Maybe I can give you a ride home. 
 That's very kind but I can't just leave it here. 
 Oh, Barry and I will find a way to pick it up, once you're settled at home. 
 That's far too much trouble. 
 Not at all. 
 I think Barry would do the same thing for my mother. 
 I hate to leave it. 
 I know this town can be a little rough- 
 But who's gonna steal a scooter from a church? 
 Well, if you're sure. 
 I'm sure. 
 You know, my car's just over here. 
 Thanks, you're very sweet to do this. 
 Here, I just, it-it's very slippery. 
 Oh. 
 You know, Barry told me that you know a lot about orchids. 
 Is that true? 
 Orchids are easy temperature, light, humidity. 
 You need moist, efficient drainage and there's several kinds of growing media. 
 uh, fir bark, sphagnum moss, perlite. 
 Oh, I'm just, uh, two blocks down and three blocks over. 
 Maybe I'll just go back to the church and wait for Barry. 
 Here you go. 
 Just hold on to it. 
 Thank you. 
 Sheila. 
 Hi, Taj Roy. 
 Good to meet you. Nice to meet you. 
 Thank you. 
 I hope you don't mind me being here. 
 I, um, I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am about Robert. I- 
 Did they find the person who did this? 
 No. 
 Cops must be asking a lot of questions. 
 I just wanted to remind you that if the cops start asking you about your past, I'm not part of it. 
 I don't know what you mean, Mr. Roy. 
 And I have no more reason to speak about you than I have to speak to you. 
 So, thank you for coming. 
 Okay, all right. 
 All right then, I am very sorry. 
 Take care of yourself, Sheila. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 We're gonna be late. 
 If your coach gives you any trouble, just tell her she can deal with me. 
 Excuse me? 
 Good morning, officer. 
 Detective John Cardinal, Algonquin Bay Police Department. 
 Taj Roy. 
 
 
 
 May I ask how you know Sheila Gagne? 
 We served in the Chamber of Commerce years ago. 
 Ah. And your line of business? 
 I own a trucking company. Oh. 
 Sheila didn't seem- Bye, All that happy to see you. 
 Well, was she happy to see you? 
 I mean, she just lost her husband. 
 Would you tell me where you were when Robert disappeared, Mr. Roy? 
 I was in Sudbury. 
 I was with my daughter, we were at a skating competition. 
 How'd you do? 
 Third, not good enough. 
 Better than I coulda done. 
 Yeah, well, now we're gonna be late, so. 
 Yeah, can you think of anyone who would wanna hurt Robert Quillen or Sheila? 
 No idea. 
 I was just here paying my respects. 
 How well did you know Robert? 
 By reputation. 
 What do you mean by that? 
 It means, can we go now? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Have a good skate. 
 Let me know if you have anything. 
 Yeah. Okay, thanks. 
 Get anything? 
 A couple misdemeanours, nothing recent. 
 Yeah, well, Sheila didn't like seeing him. 
 I think there's bad blood there. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Mom? 
 Mom? 
 We're gonna find out who did this. 
 You can't think of anyone who would wanna hurt you? 
 I've been going over every choice I have ever made, trying to figure out which one brought me here. 
 It's-it's okay. 
 I think I just need to be alone. 
 But thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Keep in touch. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Appreciate you getting a rush on that for us. 
 Yep. 
 The lab says the tox screen shows cocaine and marijuana for Wade Kleiss. 
 Robert Quillen's came back clean. 
 Okay, so the killer stuns Robert, binds him but doesn't subdue him with drugs. 
 He wants his victim fully conscious. 
 He's confident. 
 He's done this before. 
 Yeah. 
 Where are we on Taj Roy? 
 His ex-wife doesn't like him but she confirmed his alibi. 
 She was at the skating competition in Sudbury, along with coaches and other parents. 
 I tried to find a connection between Taj and Sheila or Robert but I couldn't find anything, other than The Chamber of Commerce, like he said. 
 Cardinal. 
 Where? 
 We're on our way. 
 Look, Mr.Leblanc, we're gonna find her but I really need you to keep calm. 
 She comes here every day to light a candle for my dad. 
 Every day and then she comes right home. 
 It doesn't make sense. 
 She wouldn't leave her scooter here. 
 Does your mother suffer from memory loss or confusion? 
 She didn't just wander off. 
 Excuse me. 
 Listen, this might just be a senior thing, I mean, she left her scooter, but with the Quillen case every missing person. 
 All right. 
 Uh, let's start a search perimeter. 
 You canvas for, um, video cameras. 
 Ah, McLeod- 
 Mr. Leblanc, I'm Detective Cardinal, I understand you're worried about your mom? 
 I talked to the priest, I called all my mom's friends, I checked all the stores around here, the coffee shops. 
 Take a breath. 
 All right. We're gonna find her. 
 Uh, when is the last you saw her? 
 The priest saw her leave three hours ago. 
 And you're sure she didn't just- 
 No, I already told the other detective, she's sharp, she doesn't wander. 
 Why aren't you out looking for her? 
 Cardinal! 
 Sorry. 
 He's taken another one. 
 Barry. 
 You ever seen a feather like this? 
 No. 
 My mother loves birds. 
 She feeds 'em in her backyard, in the park. 
 But not birds like that. 
 This looks like something, something bigger I-I think. 
 So it's not hers? 
 I don't think so, why? 
 Are you familiar with the names Wade Kleiss, Robert Quillen or Sheila Gagne? 
 I've never heard of Wade Kleiss. 
 I saw about Robert on the news but I never met him. 
 I don't think Mom knows him. 
 And Sheila? 
 I went to school with her 30 years ago. 
 Have you seen her since? 
 I don't know, just on T.V. 
 Not in person? 
 We've run into each other a couple of times over the years. 
 I wouldn't say I know her. 
 What does this have to do with my mother? 
 Can you think of anyone who would wanna hurt you or your family? 
 Is this like what happened to Robert Quillen? 
 He was taken, too. 
 Just a couple of days ago, I mean, uh- that can't be coincidence. 
 Barry. 
 If you can think of any reason someone would want to abduct your mother, or of anyone with a grudge against you, you need to tell us now. 
 I don't. I- 
 I don't know who would do something like that. 
 Excuse me. 
 The scooter was sabotaged. 
 Somebody cut the battery cables. 
 Did the son know anything? 
 I don't know if he was hiding something or just in shock. 
 According to the priest, Mrs. Leblanc was alone in the church. 
 He didn't see her leave. 
 No cameras in the parking lot. 
 And we're checking all CCTV in the area. 
 She's 76 years old. 
 We know what he has in store for her. 
 We don't know that he has the same plan for her as he did for Robert Quillen. 
 Yeah, we do. We do- 
 A call just came in, altercation between a man and an elderly woman, description matches Adele Leblanc. 
 Leave me alone! 
 Leave me alone! 
 Police! Hey! 
 Step away. 
 Cardinal it's not her! 
 Get off me! 
 It's not her! 
 Arrest him. 
 My son, he didn't mean anything! 
 Domestic assault. 
 You wasted our time. 
 You prick. 
 Hey! Cardinal! 
 Stop! 
 I didn't even hit her! 
 Enough! 
 Nothing from checks on Highway 1, 11, 17 and 63, helicopter and UAVs haven't spotted anything either. 
 He had her well outta town before we even knew she was missing. 
 We can send the team back to the clearcut and where else? 
 We don't know where until we have a why. 
 He could be taking her anywhere. 
 My guess is somewhere remote. 
 Okay, well, I was just out at the greenhouse, where Barry Leblanc works, looks like someone vandalized the place. 
 Heating system was tampered with, sprinklers were activated the whole place was flooded and freezing when he arrived. 
 Who notified him? 
 Said he got a call, male voice, thought it might of been one of the new hires. 
 So, somebody deliberately drew Barry away before his mother was abducted? 
 It looks that way. 
 Anyway, I got Ident looking for prints, but I wouldn't hold your breath. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just 38 below tonight with a wind chill. 
 Well, if the killer's pattern holds, she'll be wearing something warm. 
 At her age and weight, she'll still only have a few hours. 
 I know. 
 (MUFFLED WHIMPERING 
 Stop right there. 
 Please I just wanna go home. 
 I'm so-so cold. Yeah, yeah I know. 
 Please, please let me go-go home. 
 I know. I know. I just wanna go home. 
 Please, please. Listen. 
 Listen, Just tell Barry that you love him, okay? 
 I don't understand what I did wrong! 
 You didn't do anything wrong. 
 Okay, listen, you have nothing to be sorry about. 
 You're out here because of Barry. 
 That's not-not true, Barry wouldn't do anything to- 
 No, shhhh. 
 Just tell your son you love him and we're done. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, just-just, shh. 
 I, I love-love you, Barry. 
 Okay? 
 That was very good, Adele. 
 Shh shh shh shh shh shh. 
 I'll be right back. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 As local temperatures drop, a 76-year-old Algonquin Bay woman, is feared missing. 
 Police are asking the public for assistance in locating Adele Leblanc. 
 She was last seen at St. Michael's Church wearing a grey wool jacket and white scarf. 
 Police are asking anyone who may have seen Ms. Leblanc to call the Algonquin Bay Police tip line. 
 Please! Please! 
 I-I won't tell anyone about you! 
 I won't say a word, I-I promise! 
 Please, please, don't do this! 
 Please! 
 Please! 
 No, please! 
 Don't do this! 
 Don't do this! 
 No! 
 Please! 
 Please!
