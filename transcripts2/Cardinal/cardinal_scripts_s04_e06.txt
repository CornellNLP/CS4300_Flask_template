 Previously on "Cardinal". 
 He had to know somebody would be out of here soon. 
 He wants them to be found. 
 Same winter clothes as Robert Quillen. 
 So there should be another video. 
 I love you, Barry. 
 You know why this is happening. 
 Why punish us for it? 
 Because we did nothing, we said nothing. 
 We let it happen. 
 You remember I spoke to my old colleague in Toronto? 
 You got the job? Mhm. 
 Ever miss this city? 
 Anyway, that was another life. 
 And you can start a new one. 
 We think somebody hired a professional, but it's possible they weren't the real targets. 
 Why would someone want to hurt you two so badly? 
 Those people and what they did to this place, to me and to her, I need them to see me. I need them to know. 
 You're a part of what happened. You know you were. 
 I'm about to lose everything because of this crap that Ken got us mixed up in. 
 I'm on my way to you. 
 I want you to pack a bag and get ready to move. 
 Where's my son? 
 He's where you put him. 
 Help! 
 Have you found my father? 
 He's dead. 
 I thought you were good at this, you and your partner. 
 You said that you wanted to retire, but you keep doing this job that grinds you down and it makes you shut everyone out. 
 Why can't you just stop? 
 You can't just let Lise walk out of your life. 
 I don't want you to leave. 
 Rebecca Bailey, masters student, raped and murdered in the area. 
 And this is the guy convicted for it. 
 Scott Riley, alpha type, loved to hunt. 
 He had some sort of an environmental awakening. 
 The salvage yard, the clearcut, the quarry. 
 And the forest. 
 His next victim. 
 So he's convicted, loses everything. 
 The woman he loves, 20 years of his life. 
 20 years to plan his revenge. 
 Sheila Gagne, Ken McNider, Barry LeBlanc. 
 He wants them to pay for Rebecca's death. 
 So who's the fourth? 
 If I go to my friend at the OPD, He will make sure that we get fair treatment. 
 Stop, stop, stop. 
 We found these in Neil Cuthbert's cabin. 
 The parka's a youth, size medium. 
 Taj Roy has a daughter. 
 And she'd fit that parka. 
 Mena! 
 I've got Sheila Gagne in a truck in the other room. 
 I'm finished with her. 
 I'm finished with Barry and with Ken. 
 There's only you left. 
 Sheila Gagne, you're under arrest. 
 Drop the gun! 
 No need to wait for my lawyer. 
 I want to help. 
 Okay. 
 We know you tipped off Ken McNider about logging rights in the Aagimaak Forest in return for him cutting you in on the profits. 
 Is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 You knew Barry LeBlanc? 
 Did you also know Taj Roy at the time? 
 We met Taj after. 
 Ken said we needed someone to look after roads and transport. 
 When the four of you encountered Scott Riley and Rebecca Bailey in the forest, what were you doing? 
 Ken was shooting the falcons. 
 We couldn't log with them nesting there. 
 I didn't want any part of that. I refused. 
 But you were there? 
 Ken told me if I didn't show up that day, he would cut me out of the deal. 
 It was my deal. 
 He thought it would prove we could trust each other if we all took part in it. 
 And so when you were done, you were leaving the forest and that's when you were confronted by Scott. 
 I saw Scott coming and she was following behind. 
 Ken told me to get the dead birds out of there so they wouldn't see them, and I did. 
 So who hit Rebecca Bailey? 
 Taj told me yesterday that Ken did. 
 He was trying to hit Scott. 
 And Taj Roy took the snowmobile keys, stranding them. 
 He just said that he made it so they couldn't leave. 
 You're telling us that you didn't know that at the time? 
 Well, I saw later that Scott was arrested for Rebecca's murder. 
 He-he did leave her. 
 I said nothing. 
 I was ashamed that I was any part of any of it. 
 I never even told Robert what we did that day. 
 Your husband was murdered, Sheila. 
 Adele LeBlanc was murdered and you still said nothing. 
 I didn't know until after Adele. 
 I tried to warn the others. 
 I tried to make up for that day with every good thing that I've done since then. 
 And Scott Riley wasn't worth throwing it all away. 
 A young man's entire life was thrown away and people have died. 
 And for what? 
 For you. 
 Do you have any idea where Scott might take Taj and Mena? 
 If I did, I would tell you. 
 Can you show us on the map roughly where everything happened the day Rebecca Bailey died? 
 Yeah, I'll do whatever I can. 
 I'll get a map. 
 I stood up for you, Sheila. 
 If you only told me. 
 But now all these people are dead. 
 Jerry, I'm so sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Mena! 
 Get off me! 
 Something I need to know. 
 You're gonna listen to me! 
 No, you listen! 
 Or it gets worse for your daughter. 
 Do you understand? 
 Nod if you understand, please. 
 You knew this was coming, right? 
 But still, you hid behind the lie, even though you knew it could end your daughter's life. 
 What does that make you? 
 I'm not the one that did this to you. 
 No? 
 No. 
 Ken, he said he was gonna send someone back for you two. 
 I didn't know you two were still out there until it was too late. 
 You didn't know? No. 
 I tossed your keys in the bush to delay you, that's all. 
 You guys got lost. 
 Nobody could've walked out of here alive hurt like her, and you know that! 
 You know that! 
 I'm sorry! You're sorry? 
 Ken is dead. 
 You're all that's left now. 
 You have to know you're not getting out of this alive. 
 I can smuggle you in one of my trucks, get you somewhere safe, give you enough money to last you the rest of your life. 
 Any other way, you end up dead or back in jail. 
 I know you don't want to do this. 
 That's the most truthful thing that you've said. 
 Then it should be me. 
 Just me. 
 Let Mena go. 
 You can tie me up like you did the others, I don't care. 
 My life for hers. 
 When it's all over, Taj, I intend to let what's left of you walk away from this place. 
 But your daughter's life ends today. 
 No, don't! 
 Goddamn you! 
 No, you can't! 
 Cut me free! 
 Hey?! 
 Come on! 
 You and me! 
 You want to hurt me?! 
 Then hurt me! 
 Robert Quillen was found near a clearcut, Adele LeBlanc, the auto salvage yard, Ken McNider, his old sawmill, and Josh, at the Mead Lake Quarry. 
 Sheila said in the '90s, most of the Aagimaak area was undeveloped. 
 It's been divided up since, but every site that Scott has chosen is within this region. 
 We think this is where he's taken Taj and Mena because it's so meaningful to him. 
 It's where all of this started 20-odd years ago. 
 This is where Rebecca Bailey's body was found. 
 The area around, it's still mostly forest. 
 That's gotta be the most significant place for him. 
 Yeah, it's just off the 19th line. 
 We have the coordinates from the old case file. 
 Yeah, but he's gotta know we have those. 
 Just saying, he may choose another spot. 
 Any other ideas? 
 Then let's hope they're out there. 
 Shh. 
 You should know, your father and his friends, I lost someone because of what they did. 
 They let people believe that I did terrible things to her. 
 But the worst thing about your father is 
 he could have stopped all of this. 
 He's alive. 
 Be advised of ongoing hostage situation in the Aagimaak Forest. 
 Units are surrounding the area and securing exit routes. 
 EMS personnel on standby. 
 Suspect is armed and dangerous. 
 If suspect or hostages are sighted, alert dispatch. 
 Do not approach. 
 I'm gonna set you down, okay? 
 Oh, careful, okay? 
 Don't sleep. 
 Look, we need to go get help, okay? 
 We need to go to the police and tell them what happened, Bec. 
 We move or we die. 
 Understand? 
 Say it with me, Bec. 
 We move or we die. 
 Huh? 
 At least take the tape off. 
 She can't breathe. 
 And she's scared. 
 Please. 
 Let me talk to my daughter. 
 At least give us that. 
 It's okay. 
 Is that better? 
 Dad, why is this happening? 
 Inside the van, he said I was gonna die. 
 No, no, that's not gonna happen. 
 You hear me? 
 To either of us. 
 Here, take this. 
 And put that coat on. 
 It'll keep you warm. 
 What about you? 
 Please. 
 Do what I tell you. 
 Wrap yourself up. 
 There you go. 
 That's a good girl. 
 Gonna be okay. 
 We'll handle the ground search. 
 We can't get a UAV or a helicopter up with this wind coming. 
 Now you two should direct your operations from here. 
 Yeah, there's, uh, a landmark where Rebecca was found. 
 This rock here. Well, that's a start. 
 Yeah. Cardinal. 
 All right, go carefully. 
 Okay. Stay in touch. 
 All right. 
 No. 
 You can't do that. 
 I'm not gonna sit here and watch her freeze. 
 That is what you're gonna do. 
 That's all you're gonna do. 
 Listen, if you love her, you'll let it end quickly. 
 Do you hear me? 
 Put it back on. 
 You don't get to die today. 
 No. I said put it back on. 
 Or she loses her coat. Do you understand me? 
 You're out of jail. 
 Why are you throwing away what's left of your life? 
 What's left of my life is this. 
 Dad. 
 Dad. 
 Dad. 
 You don't look good. 
 Try to move around, stay warm. 
 Do what she says. 
 What? 
 Listen to your daughter. 
 She's trying to save your life. 
 Move. I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 I can't. 
 Move. I can't move. 
 Wake up. I can't. 
 Stop it! Wake up! 
 I can't! Wake up! 
 Stop it! 
 Don't be scared. 
 Dying like this, 
 I've read a lot about it. 
 And they say that it doesn't hurt, 
 so please don't be scared. 
 I know you want your father to live, so why don't you tell him to stay awake. 
 Just say, "Daddy, stay awake." 
 Dad, wake up. 
 I'm here, baby, I'm here. 
 Don't sleep. 
 Please. 
 Please stop. 
 There's snowmobile trails all through here. 
 Too many to tell if it's our guy. 
 
 
 
 Are you close to the rock? 
 Think so, but the landscape's changed. 
 The trees are gone. 
 Copy. 
 Okay, so the search has already been through here by now. 
 If Scott took Taj and Mena there, there'd be some sign. 
 What? 
 Maybe he didn't take them there. 
 Why? 
 I don't know, I don't visit where Catherine died. 
 I don't even use that street anymore. 
 When I think of her- 
 When I think of her, I think of the last places that things were good, you know? 
 A cottage we thought of buying, walking through the woods while she was taking pictures. 
 The campsite. 
 Yeah. 
 Scott said that he and Rebecca slept together for the first time in that tent before the fight with Ken and the others. 
 Yeah. 
 He's been thinking about that night with her for 20 years. 
 If this is really all about revenge for what he's lost, what he's lost started there. 
 It's not to far from here? 
 No, the camp is here. 
 Okay, so you think the search went in the wrong direction? 
 Maybe. 
 Jerry, we're expanding the search to the forest northwest of the search access point. 
 You know something I don't? 
 We're not sure yet. 
 You want me to send backup? 
 We'll let you know if we see something. 
 You're ready? 
 Shh. What are you doing?! 
 Get off of her! 
 No! 
 No! 
 Please! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Camp's just a bit further on. 
 With all these snowmobile trails, do you really think he'd bring them here? 
 Well, if he managed to get out of sight, nobody would ever hear him. 
 So is it just over that ridge? 
 Looks like it. 
 Commanda, we're coming up on Riley's old winter camp. 
 Have you found anything? 
 Someone was here. 
 Might be long gone now. 
 10-4. 
 Wait for us before you move in. 
 No, Riley's had them out here for hours already. 
 No, there isn't time. 
 I'm sending the coordinates. 
 Latitude four- 
 Hey, I need your sled. 
 Did you see him? 
 No. 
 Scott! 
 Scott, we know what really happened to Rebecca! 
 Just go back! 
 Scott! 
 The next shot will kill you! 
 Go! 
 Go back! 
 We have to, We have to get around him to get to the camp. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'll move over there. 
 You cover me. 
 Ready? 
 Yeah. Go! 
 He's right there over that bridge. 
 Okay, I'm moving to the next cover. 
 No, wait. 
 Scott?! 
 Listen to me! 
 These people, you thought you'd make it right if you hurt them too. 
 But it didn't help, did it?! 
 A man killed my wife! 
 I put him in prison and he killed himself and I- 
 I liked the way it felt 
 when I heard about it! 
 But it didn't fix anything. 
 And it never will! 
 We both know I'm not walking out of these woods again! 
 Let us just take Mena! 
 I will kill you if you try! 
 I'll go over there. 
 Scott- 
 We're gonna try anyway! 
 Lise! 
 Lise! 
 Lise! 
 Lise! 
 Are you okay? 
 It's in the vest. 
 Lise. 
 I'm fine, I'm fine, it's in the vest too. 
 I've got them. 
 I'm sorry, Rebecca. 
 She wouldn't have wanted this. 
 Mena. 
 Mena? 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 Paramedics are on their way in. 
 Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Hang in there, buddy. 
 I got ya. 
 Mena, hey, you're safe. 
 Now we found you. 
 Okay. 
 It must just be a bruise but we've got to get some imaging done to be sure. 
 Okay, I'll come along with you. 
 Thanks. 
 ER's standing by. 
 Taj is a bit worse for frostbite but they'll both live. 
 Nice work, Lise. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 They think I have a cracked rib. 
 I need to go and get it checked out. 
 What are you gonna do when she's gone? 
 I don't know yet. 
 Well, I'm heading out to my hut for the weekend if you wanna think about it with a fishing rod in your hand. 
 Thanks, Jerry. 
 Yeah, just one moment. 
 Kel, it's Dad. 
 Hey, I- 
 I got those cottage plans drawn up and I'm thinking about making an offer on a piece of land. 
 Well, midsummer if all goes well. 
 Yeah, it'll have a dock you can dive off. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 You think you'll make it back up soon? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe better if you come down. 
 You'll let me know when's good? 
 Yeah. 
 Male body. 
 Looks like he's been down there a while. 
 Animals got at him. 
 Cause of death? 
 Barnhouse thinks foul play. 
 Broken neck, fractured skull. 
 You go have a look? 
 I thought McLeod was already out of here. 
 He was. 
 But he's booked for vacation next week. 
 I have to double up. 
 Got anything else on your plate? 
 No, it's fine. 
 It's treacherous.
