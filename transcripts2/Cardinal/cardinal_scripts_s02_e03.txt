 Previously on "Cardinal". 
 Ray: Surprised that the cops didn't find her. 
 Buried her deep. 
 How's her memory coming? 
 Memories are stored in many traces in the brain. 
 Some more accessible than others. 
 Lacey: Are you getting your memory back? 
 Red: No. 
 Musgrave: You put National Intelligence Service on the resume the sky's the limit. 
 You gonna tank your career for Cardinal? 
 Dyson: NIS. Delorme didn't get it. 
 I don't know who she pissed off at the RCMP. 
 (Grunting) 
 Kevin: He's a full patch biker. 
 They'll kill us! 
 Take him to the shed and hang him up. 
 Rachel: I gotta go. 
 I'll call ya tonight. 
 Cardinal: Who's blood was on that floor? 
 Was it Wombat's? 
 Does somebody out there have a beef with the Northern Raiders? 
 I want to talk to Alan Clegg. 
 Cardinal: She's Clegg's C.I. 
 Delorme: I wanna help you. 
 Rachel: You can't. 
 Ray: You'll never have to worry about money again if you follow my rules. 
 Keep your mouth shut about our plans. 
 No one at this table uses our product. 
 Break any of my rules I kill ya. 
 (Screaming) 
 (Rain Pattering) 
 Kevin (Breathless): Okay. 
 Okay, what am I going to do? 
 Toof: You fixed it. 
 You wanna try? 
 Did you hear the screaming last night? 
 Ah, no, man, I was‐ I was so launched. 
 Dude, the screaming went on for hours. 
 What was Ray doing to the guy? 
 Kev, you gotta relax, man. 
 Kev, that biker dude he woulda killed us. 
 Ray's protecting us. 
 Look, you said you wanted to go back to B. C., right? 
 What're you gonna do, show up broke again?

 I've asked Alan to join us because we have a murder, an attempted murder, and a disappearance all potentially linked to the Northern Raiders. 
 Clegg: All due respect, John, I'm just not seeing it. 
 What's your theory? 
 Cardinal: Ah, a new player in town. 
 Somebody targeting Lasalle's associates. 
 Clegg: I've been all over these guys for three years. 
 You've got nothing to indicate that someone is moving in on their turf. 
 Cardinal: The bikers' money launderer Dave Elhurst, a person of interest in Red's shooting until we found his remains on Beaufort Hill. 
 Delorme: And now another associate is missing. 
 Well, maybe Wombat took off with cash and drugs from the stash house. 
 According to Rachel, he and Lasalle are like brothers. 
 Clegg: Oh, there's no loyalty with these guys. 
 The only code they live by is greed. 
 They turn on each other in a heartbeat. 
 Delorme: Well, then if Rachel's intel is no good, let her go. 
 She's only nineteen. 
 Barely out of rehab. 
 Do you know how hard it is to get somebody in there? 
 It doesn't have to be her. 
 If I pull her, we lose our eyes and ears on the inside. 
 You have them under surveillance. 
 Lasalle knows we're watching him. 
 Girls like Rachel are the best shot we've got. 
 So it's okay when they abuse her? 
 What about all the Fentanyl deaths, hm? 
 That's Lasalle. 
 Cutting his product to maximize profits. 
 I'm not saying that you don't have to go after‐ Or the three girls from Algonquin High who overdosed last month. 
 What do I tell their parents? 
 I'm sorry, we can't get the guys who killed your kids because‐ But Rachel's expendable? 
 I'm sorry, she made her own bed. 
 It sounds harsh, I know, but in order to bring a guy down like Lasalle, we use every tool we've got. 
 (Bar Chatter) 
 Lasalle: This guy knew Wombat would be alone. 
 He knew where the deal was going down. 
 How would he know that? 
 You've been hanging around a lot lately. 
 Who's texting you? ‐My dad. 
 Nice trust. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 You better not be running around on me, hm? 
 Hm.

 Cardinal: Look at this. 
 What? ‐It's Red. 
 Where? 
 Where is this? 
 Cardinal: Gas station. 
 About an hour south of here off the 11. 
 Time stamp is the same day Commanda found her at the Tavern. 
 Yeah. She's wearing the same clothes. 
 And she used a card.

 ♪ Store Clerk: There's no record of a credit card purchase at 10:43. 
 Only cash. 
 But she‐she handed over a card. 
 She paid cash. 
 Thank you. ‐You're welcome. 
 Okay, so no footage from the pumps. 
 She must have parked in a space outside of camera range. 
 Two drinks. 
 Could have been travelling with someone. 
 Air Miles number. 
 That's the card she gave the cashier. 
 Air Miles? 
 Yeah. I use mine all the time. 
 I have thirty thousand miles. 
 But you never go anywhere. 
 Delorme: I'll track the number.

 Okay. 
 I read the shells again this morning. 
 Yeah. 
 Ray: Give me your hand. 
 That's it. 
 Now close your eyes. 
 She hasn't crossed over. 
 I told you, the bitch is dead. 
 You're sure. 
 Yeah. 
 I buried her myself. 
 (Grunting) 
 Shhhh. 
 Don't lie to me, Leon. 
 You made a mistake. 
 I'm not gonna kill ya for it. 
 Important thing is, you don't lose control. 
 She's still out there, isn't she? 
 Mhm. 
 Find her. 
 Bring her back to me. 
 I need her alive. 
 But I thought you said that she‐ Ray: I didn't recognize her power before. 
 You see? 
 We all make mistakes. 
 (Gasping) 
 (Dreamlike Instrumental) 
 Can I give you a hand? 
 Catherine: Ah, I can handle it. 
 Oh, my laptop. 
 You going to be okay? 
 I'll be fine. 
 I hate to leave you, actually. 
 You can't wait to get out of here.

 Alright. 
 Bye.

 Student at Vancouver Community College in Business Administration. 
 Cardinal: So what brings her out here gets her mixed up with bikers? 
 Terri: Terri Tait. 
 It's me. 
 Delorme: Mhm. 
 It says you live in Vancouver. 
 Does the Vine Street Café sound familiar? 
 We called them today. 
 You've been working there over a year. 
 You took a week off to come here. 
 You didn't tell them why. 
 Do you remember? 
 Sorry. 
 You were supposed to return to work on Monday, and you never showed. 
 We found some footage of you at a gas station on your way to Algonquin Bay. 
 Was someone with you? 
 I think, I remember, being in a motel? 
 It's coming back to you? 
 It's foggy. Just‐just images. 
 The motel, what did it look like? 
 It might've been by a lake. 
 And you were alone? 
 I don't know. 
 Cardinal: It's okay, Terri. 
 What else do you remember? 
 That's it. I'm sorry.

 ♪ Not one motel has recognized her picture. 
 Terri was lying. 
 She's just getting her memory back. 
 Every time we asked her a question, she refused to make eye contact. 
 You saw it, too. 
 She took a bullet to the brain. 
 We can't apply the same criteria. 
 No, you're right. 
 We don't know what's normal for her. 
 So why are we so sure she's innocent?

 No. She told me 207. 
 Well let's go find out where she is, huh?

 Next minute she was gone. 
 Yeah, she was here. 
 Did she say she was going somewhere? 
 No. But she was freaked out. 
 About what? 
 Probably the guy who shot her. 
 He's still out there, right? 
 Yeah. So help us find her before he does. 
 She borrowed my phone. 
 She remembered a phone number? 
 Unlock it.
