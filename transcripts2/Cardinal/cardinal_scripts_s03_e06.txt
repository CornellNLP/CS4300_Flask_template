 Cardinal: Previously on Cardinal. 
 Why would she buy this for me if she were going to kill herself? 
 Valerie: What really got to Catherine was having to write that note. 
 He had you write a suicide note? 
 I did a search of all the recent suicides in Algonquin Bay, who was seeing Dr. Bell, nine, in under two years. 
 I did everything I could to help her. 
 Did you? 
 I don't want to see John Cardinal again, love. 
 Dyson: Perry's dead. 
 He shot himself two hours ago. 
 Delorme: Our suspects, Jackson Till and Sharlene Winston now have a large quantity of weapons in their possession. 
 Lloyd: Money, is that what you want? 
 Mama: I'm not interested in your money. 
 You've got one thing I want. 
 I need you to set some traps on the parameter of the property. 
 Her prison psych assessment mentions, 'complex apocalyptic delusions'. 
 End of the world stuff. 
 Jack: Just like you said, enough to fight the war, enough to win.

 Cardinal: So what do we think? 
 Delorme: I think it's her. 
 I think Sharlene Winston is Amy Scriver. 
 Okay, let's say you're a seventeen year old girl who just killed your parents. 
 How do you get rid of two bodies? 
 McLeod: Well, she couldn't have carried them far. 
 But she could get them on a boat. 
 Same thing that happened at Island Road and Amy Scriver would've known the deepest parts of Black Lake, where to sink 'em. 
 Might explain why they were never found. 
 Delorme: But now you have a sonar scanner.

 Hey old man, whatever you have to do to get that plane ready to fly. 
 It's time. 
 Shut up. 
 Nikki: They have us surrounded. 
 Mama: No, if they knew we were here, we'd be dead already. 
 We're never gonna get past those police boats. 
 We're not going anywhere. 
 We're gonna make a go for it. 
 We're gonna shoot our way past them. 
 And then a bullet hits our gas tank and we all go up in flames. 
 Well then maybe we should just wait. 
 Maybe they'll just go away. 
 If we want the enemy to go away, we have to make them go away. 
 Come on. 
 Go. 
 Hey, Dr. Jones, thank you for getting back to me. 
 Any luck finding background on Dr. Bell? 
 Dr. Jones: Well, he's moved around a lot, which in and of itself is not of concern. 
 But he's gone from New York to Toronto, to Ottawa and then finally Algonquin Bay. 
 Delorme: Each city smaller than the last. 
 Dr. Jones: And less prestigious. 
 Dr. Jones, I need to know facts. 
 Dr. Jones: In Toronto he was sued on several occasions by families of patients who'd killed themselves. 
 All of the cases were eventually dropped. 
 Proving psychiatric malpractice is complicated. 
 So there's never been a medical investigation into his methods. 
 Like into the suicide note business? 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Jones: No, not that I know of. 
 What would it take to launch one? 
 More than you have, I'm afraid. 
 I wish I could do more to help you. 
 No, it's okay. 
 Kular: Cardinal, there's a woman here to see you. 
 Wouldn't say what it was about. 
 Cardinal: Helen. 
 Uh-uh, I-I hope it's all right that I came by. 
 Of course. 
 Sure. 
 Frederick, um, he was quite upset by your visit, with you and with me. 
 Oh, I'm sorry about that. 
 Helen: I worry about him sometimes, when he's in a mood, the way he talks about his patients. 
 He's frustrated. 
 He's, he's just taken on too much. 
 He ever talk about Catherine that way? 
 I'm sorry, it's hard for me to think about her. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 I don't think he helped her at all. 
 So I took a look at some of the videos he makes of his patient sessions. 
 What I saw was- 
 Well, I think you should look at them too. 
 [suspenseful instrumental] 
 ♪ Helen: You know both of his parents killed themselves when he was a boy? 
 Unforgivable, really. 
 I hope you understand, it's not his fault. 
 But somebody needs to know. 
 I should go. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 ♪ A woman came to see me yesterday. 
 She assumed I knew John had been paying her to keep quiet about what I did. 
 Dr. Bell: And what is it you did? 
 I made a call when I was manic 
 and I blew an officer's cover. 
 Dr. Bell: John never told you? 
 Catherine: He risked his job for me. 
 Dr. Bell: And how did you feel when you learned this? 
 A man is dead because of me. 
 How do you think I feel? [sobbing] 
 Dr. Bell: And what did John say? 
 Catherine: I haven't told him. 
 Dr. Bell: Why not? 
 Catherine: He's heading a difficult investigation right now and he's already had to step away once. 
 Dr. Bell: You feel you're a burden? 
 I don't feel it, I am. 
 I have been for twenty years. 
 Dr. Bell: So you're going to go home tonight and sit next to your husband and not tell him that you know this secret. 
 Of course I'll tell him. 
 If we're going to get past this disaster I have to. 
 But not tonight, John's working late and 
 I just need to clear my head. 
 I'm going to take some pictures. 
 Dr. Bell: Your work is important to you and I think that's very healthy. 
 So, what are we shooting tonight? 
 Catherine: The Harrow Building. 
 [suspenseful instrumental] 
 ♪ He knew she was there. 
 Cardinal: Lise. 
 Yeah? 
 Cardinal: I want to show you something. 
 Dr. Bell: But I think, and this is me being very blunt, Catherine, I think you crave the attention you get when you're not well. 
 Do you disagree? 
 [suspenseful music] 
 ♪ Dr. Bell, I think we're done here. 
 Hey, how'd you get this? 
 His wife. 
 She's afraid of him. 
 Catherine: Every time I come here, I leave feeling worse. 
 It wasn't like that in the beginning. 
 But since my last depression, 
 you've been after me. 
 Dr. Bell: Lately, Catherine, every time I get close to the truth you lash out. 
 You used to welcome our sessions. 
 I've been warned about you, 
 now I'm going to warn others. 
 It's troubling, yes. 
 But she was upset. 
 She went to the roof to take photos. 
 Her mind went to a bad place. 
 Catherine didn't kill herself. 
 Believing that doesn't make it true. 
 I talked to Dr. Jones. 
 What Dr. Bell's been doing with his patients is wrong but now what you're talking about is first degree murder. 
 She told him where she would be the night she died and her threat is motive. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Bell: We talked about getting these feelings out of you, about writing a note. 
 It's just- if she walks out, I'm done. 
 I quit. 
 Dr. Bell: You've said all this before, Perry. 
 I don't know why you think anyone should take you seriously. 
 No, I could not be more serious. 
 I'll show you both just how serious I am! 
 Dr. Bell: I doubt that. 
 I think it's always gonna be more of the same with you. 
 It always is. 
 The son of a bitch. -Mhm. 
 He all but told him to go and do it. 
 So, do you think we have enough to bring him in? 
 It's hard to prove inciting suicide if he's not actually using the words, kill yourself. 
 Delorme: He also knew where Catherine was going to be the night she died. 
 Cardinal: And I'm worried about his wife. 
 Helen brought me these videos. 
 They could ruin his career. 
 I don't know where this goes, but we have to question him. 
 Well it can't be me. 
 He'll claim I'm harassing him. 
 No it can't. 
 I'll have him brought in and I'll- 
 I'll interview him myself.
