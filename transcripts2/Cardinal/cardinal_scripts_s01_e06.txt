 Previously on Cardinal... 
 Eric: It's just a normal day. 
 You go to work, get the dugs. 
 I'll get the new place set up. 
 Lionel: Edie. What's going on? 
 Josh: We're trying to have a kid. 
 The joke's on me because I found these. 
 If this isn't something that you want, you need to say so. 
 Musgrave: He got a cop killed. 
 He tipped them off, Delorme, and he erased the evidence. 
 That's the kind of secret that you pay to keep quiet. 
 Cardinal: You walk out of here with that I never want to see you again. 
 Musgrave: You find out who this guy is paying off, we got him. 
 Cardinal: Whatever you think you're looking for, there's nothing to find. 
 Delorme: So we need a vacant space while Eric was working for them. 
 There can't be that many. 
 [Gunshots & Screaming] 
 [Gunshots} 
 Where's Keith? 
 [Gunshot] 
 Dyson: There's no sign of Keith London. 
 We're looking for a body, aren't we? 
 Edie: They got Eric. 
 Keith: You don't have to do this. 
 You can let me go. 
 Edie: I can't. 
 Ugh. -Ah!

 [Pulsing Music] 
 Dyson: The tools we found at the school had your son's blood on them. 
 But we are continuing our search. 
 I have volunteers coming in from Sudbury, and dog teams are arriving this morning from Toronto. 
 Melissa London: But it's too late. 
 That's what you're saying, isn't it? 
 Keith is gone. 
 Dyson: You are gonna have to prepare for that possibility. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 Delorme: I'm Detective Delorme with the Algonquin Bay Police. 
 I'm gonna need your guest list and security footage for the past week. 
 [Ethereal Music] 
 * 
 Kelly: Did they take your gun? 
 Ah, a man died. 
 There's procedures. 
 He was a serial killer. 
 You did your job. 
 Cardinal: They know that. 
 They should be giving you an award, not a grilling. 
 Cardinal: Well, it will be over soon and then we can go see Mom. 
 I told her I was coming this morning. 
 I'll just take a cab over. 
 You need to let me be a part of this, Dad. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 And I want you to be honest with me. 
 Is there a dead raccoon in your freezer? 
 How would you describe your frame of mind yesterday? 
 Focused. 
 Nothing preoccupying you? 
 Nothing causing you undue stress or agitation? 
 I was fine. 
 Fit for duty. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 SIU Agent: And how do you feel today? 
 Today's the day after we lost another kid. 
 But you caught the killer. 
 That must be a source of some relief. 
 Detective, you were involved in another incident that SIU looked at four years ago. 
 That's right. 
 SIU Agent: A drug raid in Toronto. 
 Cardinal: What does that have to do with this? 
 SIU Agent: I see that after the incident you requested some time off, citing, uh, the emotional toll. 
 An officer died. 
 Of course. 
 And shortly after, you transferred out of Toronto back here. 
 Is that right? 
 Only after answering a thousand questions, all of them on the record. 
 SIU Agent: I understand and we don't have to rehash it. 
 Cardinal: We seem to be. 
 Paul, um, can you run this plate for me, please? 
 Detective, 
 an event like you went through yesterday, something that violent, it can call up trauma from past experiences. 
 Are you aware of the support services available to you? 
 I am. 
 SIU Agent: Because these things, they stay with you. 
 Lidstrom? 
 Got it. 
 Thanks. 
 I got you, John. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 Edie: Open the door. 
 Gran, my hands are full. 
 Do you want your steam or not? 
 [Banging] 
 TV Reporter: ...police have identified the deceased as 28-year-old Eric Fraser. 
 Fraser is alleged to have committed two murders in the Algonquin Bay area and may be connected to more. 
 The Coroner's service is working to locate next-of-kin. 
 Police confronted Fraser at the abandoned school... 
 Did you-did you know? 
 * 
 Edie.

 [Gasps] 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 Delorme: Can I have a word? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 You're thinking about the meds, right? 
 From Todd Curry's toxicology? 
 What about them? 
 Prescription stuff. 
 Rare. 
 Where does Eric Fraser get his hands on that? 
 Delorme: Internet? 
 Cardinal: Maybe, but why the cocktail? 
 Why not just a simple tranquilizer and be done with it? 
 Because he's not a doctor, he doesn't know any better. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm not saying anything. 
 I'm asking. 
 Are we missing a piece? 
 You're being investigated for corruption. 
 That's why I was transferred to CIS. 
 [Heavy Breathing] 
 I told you, there's nothing to find. 
 Delorme: Yesterday a woman named Tammy Lidstrom visited you. 
 She's the ex-girlfriend of Delroy Moss. 
 Delroy was your inside guy in Toronto. 
 He connects you to Kyle Corbett. 
 I was investigating Kyle Corbett. 
 That's no secret. 
 Lidstrom visits regularly. 
 She stays at the Chateau Guay Motel under a false name. 
 You pay her, John, secret payments in cash. 
 Money that you launder through Thunderbird Casino. 
 You tipped off Corbett's people. 
 As a result, an officer died. 
 You pay Lidstrom to stay quiet about it. 
 So why are you telling me? 
 Why not just file your report? 
 Because I want to understand. 
 You won't. 
 Tell me you didn't know they'd leave explosives. 
 Tell me you didn't know an officer would die. 
 Tell me that much. 
 It sounds like you have your answers. 
 Why? 
 Money. 
 Do what you have to do, 
 but let me tell Dorothy Pine that we caught the killer. 
 I'm filing my report this afternoon. 
 You have until then. 
 [Car Idling] 
 [Knocking] 
 Cardinal: His name was Eric Fraser, 28 years old, 
 and he won't be harming anyone anymore. 
 Fraser worked 
 at the store where we believe Katie bought this. 
 That's where he saw her? 
 Cardinal: Possibly. 
 I didn't know if you'd want it back or not. 
 In the coming days, you'll hear things about me, mistakes I made. 
 But I want you to know, 
 with Katie, 
 I did everything I knew how to do. 
 Are you hungry? 
 People keep bringing me food. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 * 
 Delorme: I just wanted to let you know I've completed my investigation. 
 I'm submitting my report to Sergeant Musgrave this afternoon. 
 Dyson: Are you okay? 
 In Financial you find someone who broke the law. 
 You do the math. 
 You nail him. 
 Black and white. 
 The task you have been given, you're gonna have doubts. 
 Six months ago, I called off the search for Katie Pine. 
 I followed the rules. 
 I did what I thought was right. 
 Sometimes that's the only part you get to be sure about. 
 So here's what you do. 
 If you're, uh, McLeod, you go home, you kiss your wife, you have a beer. 
 And if you're Cardinal, you keep chewing on it until you're in pieces. 
 The doubts you have, can you live with them or not? 
 Hey. 
 Josh, right? 
 Yeah. Hi. 
 Um, is Lise here? 
 I was in the neighbourhood. 
 I think she just left. 
 You can probably still catch her. 
 Ah. I'll give her a call. 
 Hannam: You must be proud of her. 
 She's done really well here. 
 Yeah. I'm-I'm a lucky guy. 
 I'll catch up with her tonight. 
 Okay. -Yeah. 
 Good to see ya. -Yeah. 
 No, no, it's-it's in the freezer, like a Thanksgiving turkey. 
 What on earth for? 
 I don't know. He... he found it and didn't want to put it in the trash? 
 He hates raccoons. 
 Not this one. 
 I said I was gonna throw it in the woods. 
 You should have seen his face. 
 You know, he didn't want me to come here. 
 He doesn't think I can handle it. 
 It's me he's trying to protect.

 Dyson: John, you know you're not supposed to be here. 
 Go home. 
 I'm not staying. 
 Dyson: Let SIU do their thing. 
 I just wanted to say thanks. 
 You're good at your job, Noelle. 
 You don't need me to tell you that but... 
 Is this the stuff from Eric's van? 
 The guitar wasn't in there. 
 It wasn't at his house either. 
 That never bother you? 
 Maybe he sold it? 
 The bag from Southridge Pharmacy. 
 Dyson: It's a shopping bag. 
 Empty. 
 Along with about two hundred other items and they're not going anywhere. 
 It's time to clock out, John. 
 I know it's hard. 
 Go home. 
 Get some rest. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll do that. 
 [Suspenseful Music]

 Cardinal: You had any medicine go missing recently? 
 An officer came by a couple days ago. 
 We checked. 
 There was nothing missing. 
 Triazolam. 
 You have that? 
 Of course. 
 I'd like to check again. 
 Okay, three bottles, just as there's supposed to be. 
 And you take meds directly from here to fill prescriptions? 
 Yeah, that's right, and then we record it all. 
 Let's count 'em. 
 What? All of them? 
 Let's count all of them. 
 Manager: 211... 
 212... 
 213. 
 Check that with the inventory. 
 What? What is it? 
 It's supposed to be 218 but there's five missing. 
 How would a customer get back here without you noticing? 
 It wasn't a customer. It was an employee. 
 Cardinal: Why do you say that? 
 Because I saw her. 
 Edie Soames. 
 [Eerie Music]

 [Sigh] 
 Delorme: Hey. 
 So John's not coming. 
 I'm the one who texted you. 
 I'm Detective Lise Delorme, Algonquin Bay Police. 
 I got your number from the Chateau Guay Motel. 
 I don't like being ambushed. 
 Tammy, what I'm about to tell you is confidential. 
 So if you repeat any of it, you'll be charged with obstruction of justice. 
 You understand? 
 I guess. 
 You're keeping that purse awfully close. 
 Anything in there I should be worried about? 
 What do you take me for? 
 I don't know you. 
 I'm investigating John Cardinal on charges of corruption. 
 I need you to corroborate some information. 
 I know Cardinal tipped off Corbett. 
 I know you're extorting him. 
 So describe to me, what's your relationship with Cardinal? 
 Tammy: Top tier. 
 How much money did he get for alerting Corbett? 
 You're-you're bouncing around here. 
 No. No, I'm not. 
 No, it's all the same question. 
 Why would he do it? 
 His job was to befriend you, to stay close. 
 Maybe he wasn't doing it for the money at all. 
 Maybe he wanted to protect you. 
 You think Cardinal and I had an affair? 
 I don't know. 
 All that time together, the lines get blurred. 
 And what about Catherine? 
 Was he blurry on that subject too? 
 You're grasping, Detective. 
 Uh, how do you know about Catherine? 
 How do you even know her name? 
 Cardinal wouldn't expose his home life to you. 
 Well, he must have let it slip. 
 While undercover? 
 No chance. 
 Tammy: Well, later then. 
 While you were extorting him. 
 Look, I don't remember. 
 I got nothing more to say.

 TV Talk Show Host: Welcome to Divine Intervention. 
 My first guest is certain that after she came out at the age of 57, after having a family of her own, including children and marriage to a man, she was utterly ostracized from her family and it completely upended her life. 
 She thinks she's the victim of serious discrimination and it's leading to trauma in new relationships that are created and then broken. 
 Let's hear her story. 
 Woman on TV: I came out at the age of 57. 
 I loved my husband...

 This is Detective John Cardinal. 
 I have a DB at 212 Leighton in the basement. 
 I need an IDENT team. 
 I need units, and we need to lock this entire property down. 
 The whole place is hot. 
 This has to do with the Eric Fraser murders. 
 I need you to put a BOLO out on an Edie Soames, S-O-A-M-E-S. 
 If there's a car registered in her name, call me back. 
 And check to see who else lives at this address, 212 Leighton. 
 [Clanging] 
 If there's a car in the owner's name, BOLO that too. 
 [Clanging] 
 [Clanging] 
 [Pulsing Music] 
 [Moaning] 
 Cardinal: Keith. Keith. Keith. 
 Don't let her see me. 
 Cardinal: Keith. Just stick with me, Keith. 
 You'll be fine. 
 Hold on. 
 You'll be fine. 
 [Whimpering] 
 You'll be fine. 
 You'll be fine, son. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 You'll be fine, son. 
 [Moaning] 
 Cardinal: You're gonna be fine, son. 
 In you go. There you go. 
 In you go. 
 Call regional. 
 Tell them I'm bringing in a knifing victim. 
 He's hypothermic. 
 He'll need blood. I'm ten minutes out. 
 Get your car outta there now! 
 Officer: Yes, sir! 
 [Knocking] 
 Can I help you? 
 I-I'm looking for Detective Cardinal. 
 He's not here right now. 
 I can pass along a message. 
 Ah, he's been helping me. 
 Boyfriend problems. 
 Um, I can give him a call if you want. 
 Edie: It's okay. 
 Don't bother him. 
 Are you all right? 
 It's the injury. 
 It makes me dizzy. 
 If I could just sit down for a minute? 
 Uh... yeah of course. 
 Come in. 
 [Eerie Music] 
 * 
 Here. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you Detective Cardinal's daughter? 
 Yeah. 
 Kelly. 
 What's your name? 
 I saw him on TV. 
 Kelly: Yeah. He's been in the news lately, unfortunately. 
 Did he ask you to come by? 
 No. 
 But you've been here before? 
 Edie: You're wondering how I got the address. 
 I work at a pharmacy. 
 He's in the system. 
 Oh. 
 Edie: Divalproex Sodium. 
 That's what he got. 
 It's a mood stabilizer. 
 That'd be for my mom. 
 But should you really be talking about that? 
 It's kind of private. 
 Do you think he'll be long, your dad? 
 Tell you what. Why don't I call him? 
 Edie: I don't think you should. 
 No, no, really. It's okay. 
 I'll just give him a quick ring and see when he's coming home. 
 Put it down. 
 [Ethereal Music]

 Cardinal Voicemail: You've reached Detective John Cardinal. 
 Please leave a message. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 I need to talk. 
 Tabernac, John. 
 Turn on your phone. It's important. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 * 
 Cardinal: Anything on Edie Soames? 
 DB was her grandmother. 
 The BOLO's gone out and roadblocks are in place. 
 I should get back to the office. 
 I have very clear instructions from Dyson, you're to go home. 
 John, we'll find her. 
 Go home. Pour yourself a drink. 
 Save some glory for the rest of us. 
 [Eerie Music] 
 * 
 Cardinal: [Sighs] 
 * 
 Cardinal: Hey. 
 What? 
 Oh. 
 It's-it's not my blood. 
 * 
 Edie. 
 Edie Soames. 
 [Gunshot & Screaming] 
 Cardinal: Ugh. 
 Kelly: AH! AH! STOP! 
 Cardinal: Argh. 
 [Breathing Heavy] 
 Do you have a gun? 
 [Groaning] 
 Cardinal: No. -Good. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Kelly: No! 
 Stop it! Please! 
 Stop it! 
 Dad! 
 [Groaning] 
 Please. 
 You took Eric from me. 
 Now I'm gonna take something from you. 
 [Laboured Breathing] 
 Please. No. No. 
 [Whimpering] 
 She's not... she's not part of this. 
 Please. 
 Edie: Look at me, Kelly. 
 Please. 
 [Grunting] 
 Hey. 
 No, you're not dismissed. 
 You have to watch this. 
 [Grunting] 
 Edie: I'm gonna put a bullet in your daughter's brain. 
 You have to watch. 
 [Grunting] 
 Edie: Hey! 
 You have to watch! 
 Cardinal: Ugh! 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 Cardinal: Run, Kelly! 
 [Grunting] 
 Ugh! Ohhhh. 
 Ah. 
 Ugh. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 You don't have to do this for Eric. 
 I'm not doing this for Eric. 
 Then why? 
 'Cause it feels good. 
 [Gunshots] 
 John? 
 John? 
 John? 
 It's okay. 
 Look at me. 
 [Heavy Breathing] 
 Delorme: It's okay. 
 [Sombre Piano Chords] 
 * 
 Delorme: Oh, John. 
 John. 
 Call 911! 
 Tell them an officer has been shot. 
 John? 
 Stay with me. 
 Oh, no, you can't go anywhere. 
 John! 
 I know the truth. 
 I know what happened in Toronto. 
 I figured it out. 
 I know the whole story. 
 [Heavy Breathing] 
 Delorme: I know. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 * 
 Delorme: Hey. 
 What's that for? 
 You saved my life. 
 How's Kelly? 
 Cardinal: Doing okay. 
 She's a strong girl. 
 Can I run something by you? 
 Before I file my report. 
 Whatever you have to do. 
 I just want it to be over. 
 Your call to Corbett. 
 You wouldn't record it and then erase it. 
 It makes no sense. 
 You'd talk in person. 
 Leave no trace. 
 It happened. 
 You know it did. 
 How much did he pay you? 
 Enough. 
 Criminal conspiracy. 
 Obstruction of justice. 
 What was it worth to you? 
 Twenty grand? 
 Fifty? 
 You can't name a figure because there isn't one. 
 You wouldn't do it for money. 
 It's not who you are. 
 But you'd do it for Catherine. 
 [Dramatic Music] 
 Delorme: She made the call, didn't she? 
 No. 
 She was manic. 
 She got her hands on your burner phone, dialed the only number in there. 
 She blew your cover. 
 Cardinal: You're wrong. 
 You found the recording later, after the raid went bad. 
 You found it and you erased it. 
 Someone has to pay. 
 I understand that. 
 But not her. 
 She doesn't even remember making the call. 
 She was confused, delusional. 
 She called looking for me. 
 She needed my help and I wasn't there. 
 If she knew an officer died because of her, 
 it would kill her. 
 It's not your job 
 to protect her from herself. 
 Delorme, 
 I need her. 
 Tell them it was me. 
 Ma'am, I just got back from Cardinal's. 
 How's it look? 
 Uh, IDENT guys told me to bring this in. 
 Dyson: What on earth is that? 
 It's part of the crime. 
 I didn't ask for details. 
 They told me to put it in the evidence freezer, said you'd give me the door code. 
 There's no evidence freezer, is there? 
 Get it off my desk, Constable. 
 Mm hmm. 
 [Snickering] 
 [Ethereal Music] 
 * 
 Musgrave: All right. You called the meeting, Delorme. Talk. 
 Sir, Cardinal's not a rat. 
 There's no connection between him and Corbett. 
 We're not done looking. 
 If your unsanctioned investigation into Cardinal continues, I'll make it known. 
 Sergeant, with respect, I know you're looking for a reason you haven't got Corbett all these years but it's not Cardinal. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You're sorry. 
 You're sorry? 
 Well that is amazing. 
 Sir. 
 You really want to make an enemy of me right now? 
 No. 
 But you're wasting your time with Cardinal 
 and you need to back off.
