 Previously on "Cardinal". 
 Delorme: Red bolted. 
 Cardinal: Her memory's coming back. 
 There's something she doesn't want us to know. 
 (Grunting) 
 Find her. 
 Bring her back to me. 
 I need her alive. 
 Dr. Bell: How did you feel when John questioned your decision about taking your students to Toronto? 
 I have to prove I'm okay. 
 Cardinal: She's Clegg's CI. 
 Delorme: She's barely out of rehab. 
 I want you to back off. 
 You're off the hook. 
 What about Zack? 
 He's never gonna let me go. 
 Cardinal: I had a talk with Commanda's behavioral sciences guy and he feels we're dealing with an Afro Caribbean spiritual practice and he suggests we consult an expert in the field. 
 Kevin: This is‐ what are you doing? 
 You mean what are we doing. 
 No one at this table uses our product. 
 Break any of my rules, and I kill ya. 
 Cardinal: She came out here to see her brother. 
 That's why she lied to us. 
 She's trying to protect him. 
 Who's the dealer? 
 Clegg: That's Gordie Katyuk. 
 He's one of Lasalle's guys. 
 Wombat. 
 But how does Terri fit into this? 
 It's okay. 
 It's Detective Cardinal.

 Kevin (Echoing): He's not helping. 
 (Echoing) Have a look around. 
 (Echoing) Why can't you just believe that I'm trying to have a different life. 
 (Echoing) This exact conversation‐ 
 (Echoing) This is no, no‐ 
 (Echoing) So man times. So many times! 
 (Echoing Clicking) 
 Terri (Echoing): There were trees all around and a dirt road. 
 I saw this black truck in the distance coming fast towards me. 
 The same moments keep coming back to me. 
 I wish I could remember more. 
 Cardinal: Terri. 
 You don't have to hide anything. 
 I'm not interested in your brother's drug offences. 
 My only job is to find whoever shot you. 
 Now, you went to your old house on the airbase. 
 Why? 
 It was the only place I could think of that felt safe. 
 Who was chasing you? 
 I don't know. 
 I saw this black truck in the distance and I froze. 
 I had this flash that same truck coming down a hill towards me fast, like it was gonna run me down. 
 Cardinal: Are you sure it was the same truck? 
 (Muted Rumbling) 
 Let's back up. 
 You took a flight from Vancouver to Toronto. 
 What happened after you landed? 
 Terri: My brother was waiting. 
 Outside. 
 He had a car. 
 Flashy, black. 
 He wanted me to be impressed, but it obviously wasn't his. 
 Go on. 
 I remember the highway. 
 Those little stacks of rock, Inukskuk, along the side of the road. 
 He told me that he was clean. 
 That he was finally getting his life together. 
 And you think you're brother's using again. 
 That's why you came out here. 
 I wanted to know whose car it was, and where he was getting money. 
 And what did he tell you? 
 He he had a job with a property developer. 
 I tried to get the truth out of him. 
 But it turned into yelling. 
 Well, I‐ I was yelling. 
 I shout and he gets quiet. 
 Cardinal: But he was angry. 
 The dirt road where the truck was chasing you. 
 Did Kevin take you there? 
 Terri: I don't know. 
 I‐I don't know where that was. 
 Was Kevin driving the truck, Terri? 
 My brother would never hurt me. 
 Why were you running, Gordie? 
 When I found Wombat's head in my shower‐ 
 I figured maybe I'm next. 
 So you're taking off. 
 Gordie: Yeah, I am. 
 I'm not the only one, either. 
 Delorme: Why would someone want you dead? 
 Hm? 
 New player in town. 
 Someone's trying to take over the Northern Raiders' turf. 
 He's going after the Raiders' dealers. 
 Any clue who this rival is? 
 Gordie: If I knew, I'd tell Lasalle. 
 Problem solved. 
 (Door Clicks Open) 
 Delorme: You were right. 
 Someone's picking off Lasalle's men. 
 Wombat. 
 A dealer named Brendon. 
 How's she doing? 
 Cardinal: Whoever shot her knows she's alive and is looking for her. 
 We need to find her brother. 
 You think he's our shooter? 
 Cardinal: No, but I think he'll lead us to whoever it is. 
 I don't know how it's possible for somebody to come into our town, take over our trade. 
 Kill our dealers. 
 Murder our friends. 
 And no one here knows who the hell it is. 
 I had to go outside. 
 I had to ask a favour from the brotherhood in Michigan to find out who's trying to cut us out. 
 "Northwind". 
 Now, if Wombat were here, he could tell you: 
 I don't like asking for favours. 
 So this is what we're gonna do: 
 You're gonna go out there, you're gonna talk to the people you know, and we are gonna find this Northwind and we're going to take care of this in‐house! 
 Understand?

 Catherine (Voicemail): Hi, you've reached Catherine. 
 Leave a message and I'll get back to you when I can. (Beep) 
 Hey. 
 Uh, your meds are here. 
 Give me a call. 
 (Pulsing Dramatic Music) 
 Cardinal: We have confirmation of a rival moving in on the Northern Raiders' drug trade. 
 They've taken a‐ a biker's head, and a mid‐level dealer's hand. 
 Delorme: Brendon disappeared. 
 Presumed dead. 
 Yeah. Both apparently messages to Lasalle and his boys. 
 His dealers understandably are running scared. 
 What about the girl? 
 Cardinal: She's remembering more. 
 She's given us a description of the black truck. 
 I'll need you to look for that and the car that Kevin drove to the airport. 
 Any memories of her shooter? 
 Doctor says that she has memory gaps surrounding the shooting itself and that those memories may never come back. 
 We think the shooter is still looking for her to finish the job. 
 Terri was visiting her brother Kevin, a drug user, small‐time dealer. 
 Yeah, we think that if Kevin is somehow connected to this rival, that Terri might have heard or seen something she shouldn't have.

 It‐ it was him, I think. 
 He had boots. 
 Big black ones with steel‐toes.

 Ah, a‐ a white guy, with blond hair. 
 He had a thick neck.

 Terri: I'm not lying. 
 I just can't remember. 
 I believe you. 
 Terri: But you think that the answers are in my head. 
 Everything okay? 
 Cardinal: Ah, I have to go to Toronto to meet Dr. Wasserstein. 
 The rituals expert at U of T. 
 We could Skype with her, no? 
 Pull local mug shots matching the description Terri gave us. 
 See if she can identify him. 
 (Car Engine Engages) 
 (Dreamlike Instrumental) 
 White guy with black boots and a thick neck. 
 There's a lot of guys around here that fit that description. 
 Terri went through our photo line‐up. 
 No luck. 
 Maybe he's in your surveillance files, one of the bikers or their dealers. 
 Okay. Leave it with me. 
 I'll put together a photo line‐up for her. 
 Thanks. ‐ Yup. 
 Rachel called me. 
 Thanks for pulling her out. 
 You did the right thing. 
 Sure. 
 Rachel: Hey! 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Missed you last night.

 I'm going to get changed, and then I'm gonna kick your butt.

 Yeah, I've got my Gran's truck. 
 Rachel: C'mon. Let's get outta here. 
 You just got here. 
 It's a beautiful day. 
 (Sirens) 
 These items suggest Palo Mayombe. 
 An Afro‐Caribbean religion originating in Nigeria and the Congo. 
 The shaman invokes the help of particular orishas. 
 Conflations of African spirits of Catholic saints. 
 Cardinal: And what do the orishas do? 
 They have different spheres of influence. 
 Ellegua for crossroads, Oggun for iron or metal. 
 And how does one invoke them? 
 You make offerings. 
 Ellegua likes sweet things. 
 Oggun wants iron. 
 Railway spikes? 
 That would do it, yes. 
 Ah, the power of the spirit world grows as the moon waxes, and weakens as it wanes. 
 So if I were wanting to make an offering? 
 The most potent time would be at new moon. 
 Under cover of darkness. 
 Has human sacrifice ever been a part of this? 
 There are some missionaries' accounts, but they've been discredited. 
 I mean, certainly human sacrifice would be a gross perversion of the practice. 
 Cardinal: What do you make of the missing body parts? 
 Wasserstein: I won't ascribe that to any legitimate spiritual practice. 
 But in the context of animal sacrifice, the spirit must be able to get around in the afterlife. 
 To do the shaman's bidding. 
 It would need feet to travel. 
 Eyes to see. 
 So, I've cut them off or out. 
 What do I do with them? 
 You put them in your iron pot. 
 Your nganga. 
 You stir it all with sticks, your palos, in order to keep control of the spirit. 
 You would need fresh blood to keep it working. 
 More sacrifices. 
 In theory. 
 But this‐ Maybe it was inspired by Palo Mayombe but‐ that's not what this is.

 Hi. 
 Cardinal: Hey. You got a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 How was your meeting? 
 Cardinal: Dave's killer has co‐opted an Afro Caribbean spiritual practice called Palo Mayombe. 
 Delorme: I've never heard of it. 
 Yeah, well, looks like he's created a bastardized version. 
 It fits the details of our crime scene and he's gonna kill again in three days. 
 At the new moon. 
 Who's his target? 
 Cardinal: Somebody he thinks will be a powerful servant in the afterlife. 
 Delorme: Maybe Terri? 
 She identify anyone? 
 No. I would've called.
