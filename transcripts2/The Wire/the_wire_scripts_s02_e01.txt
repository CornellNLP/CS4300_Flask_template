 Freezing my balls off. 
 It ain't so bad. Loosen up. Couple more months, it's gonna be spring. 
 Spring, huh? 
 Listen, you gotta realize the bosses did you a favor sending you down here. 
 -Citywide to Marine Unit. -7672. Go ahead. 
 Distress call from a private craft. 60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead. 
 What's the location, Citywide? 
 In the channel near the bridge. About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier. 
 10-4, we're responding. 
 My father used to work there. 
 -Beth Steel? -In the shipyards, yeah. 
 I had an uncle who was a supervisor there. Got laid off in '78, though. 
 '73 for my dad. 
 -Party boat? -Pretty one. 
 -More than one engine. -Probably an electrical problem. 
 [JAZZ] 
 Is that a police boat? 
 How are you tonight? Good to see you. Henry, how are you? 
 -Drink? -No, thanks. 
 -You're the captain? -Yeah. Harbor master? 
 No, City Police. 
 -So you're dead in the water? -Think it's the starter. 
 -You're not a mechanic? -Me? No. 
 I can't tell the aft from the stern. 
 Best I can offer you is a tow line. 
 Claude, they're gonna need a pull. 
 -10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's. -That'll work. 
 Any chance you can hold off on bringing us in? Lot of party going on now. 
 Wouldn't wanna cut it short for engine trouble. 
 You're in the shipping channel. 
 Tow us somewhere out of the way and the band plays on a while longer? 
 [LAUGHTER AND CHATTING] 
 When you walk through the garden You gotta watch your back Well, I beg your pardon Walk the straight and narrow track If you walk with Jesus He's gonna save your soul You gotta keep the devil Way down in the hole He's got the fire and the fury At his command Well, you don't have to worry If you hold on to Jesus' hand We'll all be safe from Satan When the thunder rolls We just gotta keep the devil Way down in the hole 
 Down in the hole Down in the hole You gotta help me keep the devil Down in the hole 
 PREZ: Because... You see what I'm saying, right? 
 I mean, three years in auto theft and I didn't learn anything. I didn't care. 
 I'm telling you, I didn't even wanna be a police any more. I honestly didn't. 
 I think that was why I shot up my car like I did. 
 But this thing we did on Barksdale, the wiretap and all, that felt like something, that felt like something I wanna do. 
 So I was thinking, you know, Narcotics maybe. 
 [KNOCKING] 
 -Major, you want this stuff where? -Just in here. Up against the wall. 
 If there aren't any openings in the Narcotics shift, maybe Assets Forfeiture or something. 
 Hey, hey, easy, easy. Everything breaks. 
 I mean, with this Barksdale thing. 
 Lester Freamon had us deep into the money, real deep. 
 We could've seized real estate, cash, vehicles, all kinds of stuff. 
 If the bosses... I mean, if Command had let that case go forward. We were on it. 
 -Look at that. It's the dove. -Oh, right. 
 Look at that. 
 -So what do you think? -What do I think? 
 I think you're gonna take the sergeant's exam next month. 
 And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear and because he has City Hall's ear, you're gonna make sergeant. 
 Then you'll come out here to the Southeast where, because I'm your father-in-law, you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift in a quiet sector. 
 Then you'll take the lieutenant's exam where you'll also score high. 
 I don't want to make rank, I want to work cases. Good cases. 
 Roland... 
 Listen to me. 
 You did good with the drug thing. You buckled down, you did the work. 
 Except for that thing with the Grand Jury, you took some of the stink off yourself. 
 If you'll just shut up and listen to me, you might actually have a career in this department. 
 [MUFFLED RAP] 
 -This radio ain't working that well. -You're losing it. 
 -You're losing the station. -What you mean? 
 We're so far from Baltimore, we're losing the station. 
 -Try a Philly station or some sh1t like that. -Philly radio is different? 
 You f*cking with me? You never heard a station outside of Baltimore? 
 I ain't never left Baltimore except that Boys' Village sh1t for one day. 
 I didn't hear no radio up in that bitch. 
 [CLICKS THROUGH RADIO STATIONS] 
 Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop. 
 MAN: It's been perfect tomato weather. 
 These wonderful hot, humid days and then rain at night... 
 -This a Philly station? -How the f*ck would I know? 
 Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore? That's what I'm asking. 
 Yo, that be the exit. Take that sh1t. 
 [RAP] 
 -So far, they on it. -Mm-hm. 
 [BLEEPING] 
 [HORN BLEEPS] 
 [RAP] 
 Ahoy, matey! 
 The girls always told me about the little man in the boat. Now I know who they meant. 
 -Come on board, man, I wanna show you. -Uh-uh, f*ck, no. 
 -What's the matter? -The Bunk can't swim. 
 -I ain't too good at floating neither. -So what brings you to the water's edge? 
 Ilene Nathan called. Gant case is coming up in four weeks. 
 She wants to do preliminaries on our witnesses. 
 That means the old lady from the projects, which is no problem, and your man Omar, who's in the wind. 
 Uh-huh. 
 -You got a line on Omar, Jimmy? -Well, he's not to starboard. 
 -That's port, fool. -How the f*ck would you know? 
 Come on, let me buy you lunch and we can think on this sh1t together. 
 If I leave, I gotta tell my sergeant. 
 That reminds me, Landsman wants his $10. 
 -What for? -For betting that you'd ride the boat. 
 Tell that fucker he won't see that money. He probably told Rawls where I didn't wanna go. 
 Jimmy, ain't the same there without your ass. 
 No? 
 Better, actually. Hey, come on, now. 
 The canal gets dredged, we all work. Your people, my people. 
 The canal's the key, Nat. 
 Yeah. You know how much money you'd spend to even get them talking about that? 
 If we don't take a shot, we might as well roll over and die. 
 No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier. You got a hundred ships right there. 
 The best you'll do is one or two extra gangs a week on them blowers. 
 That's six or seven-man gangs at best. 
 Yeah, but you try for that, you might come away with something. 
 You go down to Annapolis asking for the goddamn canal, you'll come back with your shriveled-ass dick in your hand. 
 What's more, if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon, some asshole's gonna f*ck us by building condominiums. 
 -Nat, if the canal were two feet deeper... -Fuck the canal. 
 I'm gonna go to the District Council. I'm gonna tell them to push for the grain pier. 
 -You feel me? -Nat, calm the f*ck down. 
 Goddamn Checkers Local - always acting like you're the king of everything and sh1t. 
 Nat, listen to me. If we... 
 Y'all need to crawl back down in them holds. 
 Remind yourself of who you is and where you come from. 
 Damn, Frank. 
 We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson take a sh1t all over you. 
 And shrivel-dick m*therf*cker that you are, you take it. 
 I wake up every morning with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter. 
 I was gonna enlighten the president of the Local 47 on this point. He chose to depart. 
 -Blue steel, gentlemen. -For Christ's sake! 
 Three and a half inches of hard blue steel! 
 -Nicky boy, you working today? -As a lasher for Big Roy's crew. 
 Attaboy. Make the family proud. 
 First day they give me in two weeks. 
 -Is Ott around? -On his ass, as usual. 
 Worthless f*ck owes me 20 for them lotto tickets. 
 Hey, Nick. 
 Need to see the Greek and get a number. He's got one on the way. 
 -Today? -Tomorrow. 
 The Atlantic Light over at North Point. 
 All right. 
 -Yo, Frank. -What's up? 
 You gotta get with Ziggy, man. He's all over the place. 
 I'm here since eight. You know I been here since eight. 
 -Hold your horses. -You f*cking goose! 
 I'm gonna find it for you. Just shut the f*ck up. 
 -How we doing? -Ain't a problem, Chief. 
 f*ck it ain't. I'm here since eight for crane-to-chassis and Tweety Bird here lost the can. 
 It ain't lost. 
 It's right here on the manifest as a hot box. Where is it, Zig? 
 -It's either in Bay 7 or... -Bay 7 is empty, man. 
 Or in 8. In that case... 
 It's definitely somewheres in the stacks. 
 -Jesus f*cking Christ. -You're killing me, Ziggy, f*cking killing me. 
 Get me a number for your shipping agent. I'll call and try to square it. And you... 
 Clock out today and leave your box. Don't come the f*ck back. 
 You hear me, Zig? You're fired. 
 Later for you, goof us. 
 f*cking guy. He loses his job and he couldn't care less. 
 -He ain't fired, man. -No? 
 That's his father. 
 -How fast do you need this? -Trial's in a month. 
 Got to start prepping it this week. 
 Officer Burns... 
 Detective. 
 I heard they posted you down here, but... 
 I mean, you know, damn. 
 -These M*therf*ckers don't play, do they? -So what brings you downstairs? 
 I was pulling evidence on the Gant case. 
 Trial date for Bird is next month and Ilene Nathan wanted to be ready. 
 You give him my love. 
 -Who? -Bird. 
 -No evidence. -What do you mean? 
 Submission slip says, "Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3, four, right rear." It says that. 
 -So? -No such thing. 
 BB has 12 sections. This says 14. You see what I'm saying? No evidence. 
 RADIO: Winters kill off the weaker varieties of caterpillars... 
 -Fuckin'... -...that's of an entirely different breed... 
 f*ck. 
 [RAP] 
 ...it's not a protection against caterpillars, they eat right through it, but it is a sort of warning system. 
 [HORN BEEPS] 
 They here. 
 [BELL TOLLS] 
 Franuś, you made it. 
 Hey, Father, got you covered here. 
 Come on. 
 Do you wanna see your window? 
 Only Franuś Sobotka would send all the way to Esslingen for stained glass. 
 The Germans are hard-headed, but you can't beat them for craft. 
 I was glad to do it, Father, for the church, you know. 
 -I need to ask you something in return. -Anything I can do. 
 -I need some face time with the senator. -Barbara? 
 She comes to the early mass on Sunday, the one in Polish. 
 We got problems. We need to see something happen with the C&D Canal. 
 The granary pier's been down for a year. 
 I got tough guys coming in to confess things I never heard before. 
 I don't need you to tell me how bad things are at the docks. 
 You'll set something up with Mikulski soon? 
 You didn't need a German window to ask me for that, Francis. 
 What's more, you've made offerings way above what it would take to get that window up there. 
 How long since your last confession? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I'll see you, Father. 
 -The sh1t might be somewhere else, man. -Yo, the sh1t always up in the door, man. 
 m*therf*cker, you've been watching us. You see any sh1t come up out of there? 
 -You seen we ain't take sh1t up off this car. -Yeah, yeah. 
 Who gonna believe us? The sh1t is missing. And f*ck what you're saying. 
 -All he'll hear is this sh1t is f*cking missing. -Check it again. 
 The sh1t ain't there, man. Call your man and say so. 
 Nigger, what you say? 
 -I said, check it again, goddamn it! -Whoa, chill, chill. 
 Yo, man, cut that sh1t the f*ck out. 
 f*ck. What the f*ck is going on today, man? 
 Taking their time, ain't they? 
 What the hell is going on? 
 -Come on, man. -Damn! 
 -Ain't anywhere in this section either. -Start on the next row. 
 Lieutenant, those two bags could be anywhere in this basement. 
 You're right. 
 -We could be here all night. -Right again. 
 So that's overtime, right? 
 f*ck me. I still cannot type. 
 -Fucking white boys, I f*cking love 'em. -Yeah? 
 -Dumb as a box of rocks. -Who? 
 White boys. The braindeads in my Kane Street case. 
 I call and tell him I wanna buy drugs. You know what he says? 
 "OK, I'll sell you drugs. How much drugs do you want?" 
 I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it, they don't ask for a meet, nothing. 
 Then when you make the deal, there's no bullshit. 
 It's the guy himself saying, "I brought the drugs. Did you bring the money?" 
 I have much respect for black people after working with these idiots for two weeks. 
 For white boys to sell drugs here, they have to make different laws, even it out for them. 
 -Affirmative action. -Leave no white man behind. 
 -Herc, what the f*ck do you want? -I need you to do the seizures. 
 You got titles, deeds, registrations? 
 -What do you have? -You do that. You're the Forfeiture Unit. 
 I write the affidavits and the filing for the City Solicitor. 
 You've gotta give me the information on what we're taking. 
 -That's a f*cking hassle. -You want the property, do the paperwork. 
 You gotta step up, Herc. You don't have me or Carver to lean on here. 
 No? Come on the raids tomorrow. Take a few doors with me for old times' sake. 
 -You taking doors? -Two houses and a bar on Kane Street. 
 Come on, Kima, mount up with us. I know you miss it. 
 I'm done rolling round the gutter. I am inside now. 
 -You're a house cat now, huh? -I made a promise. 
 I gotta say, Kima, if you were a guy - and, in some ways, you're better than most guys - your friends would buy you a beer and let you know. 
 -Let me know what? -You're f*cking whipped. 
 -Whipped? -Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life. 
 I kid you not. 
 So... 
 So? 
 So where we find Omar? 
 Who? 
 -He say anything else? -No. Just to come back. 
 All of us. 
 -How he say it? -You know, he just said it. 
 f*ck. 
 Yeah. 
 sh1t. 
 [KNOCKING] 
 -They holding to it? -So far. 
 All right. 
 They got the times right? 
 How about the mileage? 
 All right. 
 So I'm gonna ask you one more time. 
 -You never saw him out the car? -No. 
 -You stayed with him the whole time? -Every minute. 
 How long before he came out the parking garage? 
 -How long was he on his own? -Not enough time to do sh1t, String. 
 -He was in and out, like, three minutes. -Chill. 
 This sh1t is f*cked up. You follow directions? 
 -I did... -Wrote down the mileage? 
 -Yeah. -Let me see. 
 See, right there. 
 Mmm. 
 No, you three-tenths of a mile long, dawg, and if you followed directions, you wouldn't be. 
 Yo, String, I did everything like I should, man. I swear. 
 You got answers? 
 You didn't take a detour in Camden when they shut down blocks on the Boulevard? 
 -You hurt your foot. -My foot? 
 The way you kicked that tire jack the way you did. 
 -You was on us the whole time? -Who, me? 
 Y'all had people following us? 
 So where it at? 
 OK. Hey, you know, you should take me with you. 
 I should meet these guys. If I meet them, we can figure out ways to do business. 
 -Zig, these guys are real. -What, I ain't real? 
 Six degrees. Everybody's going home to sauerkraut and Santy Claus and here comes a gang of us walking the other way... 
 Little Big Roy with his wooden leg. 
 -Christ, them wooden shovels! -Yeah. 
 You children know nothing about them wooden shovels. 
 Can't have no sparks, working grain! 
 -Kaboom! -It's more like kaput. 
 Never gonna see another grain ship in Baltimore. 
 -No... -Zig, you believe these f*cking dinosaurs? 
 They sit around talking sh1t about how they used to off-load with shovels. 
 -Carry f*cking railroad cars on their backs! -And drink whiskey through a fire hose! 
 And go home and f*ck their wives silly. f*cking heroes back then! 
 The sh1t is thick in here tonight. 
 What can you do? This generation just don't know. 
 -Ain't never gonna be what it was. -No. 
 Every night with these old f*cks is like 1952 and sh1t. 
 Hey, boys, you know, when I was your age, I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day! 
 Stick it to 'em, Zig! 
 I had do it with one arm after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos fell on me! 
 -What the f*ck is a Polish dildo? -Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa. 
 [ALL TALK AT ONCE] 
 Hey, hey. But where you boys hail from, I'm sure any old breakfast link will do! 
 -You know he's gonna pull out his dick. -That boy ain't right. 
 It was just me and my old wooden leg and my old wooden shovel and my glass eye and my Polish pencil. 
 Like anyone from the Checkers Local ever used anything but a real pencil. 
 sh1t, they don't push one of them no more! 
 Talking trash about 1514. 
 Jesus H Christ, you know what? All hands starboard! 
 [ALL TALK AT ONCE] 
 The old tub is listing. Can you feel her? You wanna know why? 
 Cause them old f*cks done unloaded so much bullshit that this whole m*therf*cker's gonna capsize! 
 Brace yourselves, we're sinking! 
 Goddamn it, Ziggy, you're not taking your dick out in here again. 
 Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo that none of yous could ever handle. 
 Who says they don't make them like they used to? Pretty boy is on the town! 
 [CHEERING] 
 f*cking Ziggy, man. 
 [UPBEAT ROCK] 
 [WHOOPING AND CHEERING] 
 -Bring her in the boat? -Hell, no. 
 -She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in. -What's the plan, then? 
 We'll hook her real good. We'll tow her slowly over to the pier. 
 -What's she look like? -What do you mean? 
 -How long you think she's been in? -She's fresh. 
 -Legs are broke, though. -Probably a jumper from the bridge. 
 [THUMPING] 
 [PUNK] 
 All right, Ma. sh1t. 
 Yo, Zig. 
 Ziggy. 
 Kitchen's closed. 
 No service for drunks who can't get up in time to catch a ship. 
 -What ship? -Your father says the Talco Line is in today. 
 That makes two ships at North Point. 
 It's the Atlantic Light. Ain't due until this afternoon. 
 That still is no excuse. 
 Good morning, Mom. 
 [BURPS] 
 Couple of goddamn drunks I got. 
 Don't leave without taking your cousin with you. 
 I gotta clean in there and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass. 
 Well, you keep us guessing, don't you, Stan? 
 At Sunday mass, you can't be found. Early on a Tuesday, you arrive with an army? 
 2,500 from myself and every other Polack in three districts and four firehouses. 
 -And to what do we owe such generosity? -A surprise. 
 We ordered up a window for where you renovated the nave. A memorial. 
 To Polish police and firefighters. 
 Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie that you would not believe. 
 -For the nave? -Yeah, for the nave. 
 We could use another window on the second floor of the rectory. 
 -The rectory? -The upstairs hallway. 
 How much did them dock boys offer for this spot? I can match it. 
 Offerings are confidential, Stan. 
 -And as you can see... -I can go as high as 4,000. 
 Tell me if they went higher than four. 
 More than four. From the docks. 
 How the hell... 
 I'm sorry, Father. 
 -Who came to you with the offer? -Francis Sobotka. 
 -Frank has that kind of money? -It was from his local. 
 The Checkers? They don't have a hundred guys left paying dues. 
 It's a parish of givers, Stan. Maybe you talk to Frank. 
 Work it out somehow. 
 Yeah, we'll talk. 
 Major? 
 -Well, well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor. -Hey, Ray, how you been? 
 I got nothing but red ink under my name. Landsman's become an asshole with teeth. 
 -Fish your wish, huh? -Jumper, probably. 
 -This close to the bridge. -Probably, yeah. 
 -Pretty, though. -She is. 
 I go in the men's room this morning. Guess who's puking his guts out. 
 
 
 
 -Bunk Moreland. -How'd you know? 
 Useless f*ck can't hold his liquor. 
 -What's happenin', man? -What's up, Fam? 
 -You ain't heard from Roberto? -Not a goddamn word. 
 Billy still got our money though, right? So you need to get down to New York, man. 
 f*ck kind of game this nigger playing? You sure of our people? 
 I broke down their stories and they were clean. 
 Besides, I had some good people watch 'em. 
 -Who? -Tank, Country. 
 -How long he been home? -A month. Still on parole. 
 -He said f*ck that, straight back in the mix. -All right. 
 So good, it ain't on us, it's on Roberto. Set it straight, know what I mean? 
 When you go hard on them, take it light, but be firm. 
 They got our money and we ain't got the product. 
 You feel me? This sh1t ain't right. 
 How you fixed in here otherwise, B? 
 This ain't no thing, man, know what I mean? You come in here, you get your mind right. 
 You do two days. It's the day you come in this m*therf*cker... 
 -And the day you get out this m*therf*cker. -That's right. 
 Exactly. 
 -What's up? Coming from the hiring hall? -Yeah, I'm working the Atlantic Light today. 
 -How's it looking for Local 47? -Outta luck. 
 RO/ROs isn't going to anybody lower than a G-series. 
 Best you can get - half a day doing break-bulk on an aluminum load at Locust Point. 
 -Half a day, huh? -Seniority sucks. 
 [LOUD ROCK] 
 -Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does. -You got that right. 
 -I'm outta here. -See you. 
 -The f*ck you ain't wake me up for? -Just got up, fuck-face? 
 No, your ma makes a good breakfast. 
 -No f*cking way. -Bacon and eggs, baby. 
 -You going down to see the Greek, right? -Ziggy... 
 Come on, man. I ain't gonna f*ck it up for you. 
 For Christ's sake, will you just get in the car already? Come on, let's go. 
 [REVS ENGINE] 
 Swear to God, Ziggy, you open your mouth, I'll f*cking kill you. 
 [PA ANNOUNCEMENT] 
 -Nicky from the docks. -Spiros. 
 How are you? 
 -Who's your friend? -Zig, my uncle's kid. 
 -Your uncle? -Frankie, yeah. 
 Ziggy's his oldest. My car broke down, you know. He drove. 
 So you must be the Greek. 
 Well, I'm Greek, anyway. 
 Hey, Boris Badanoff, I know you from around the way, right? 
 Why am I Boris? I don't understand this. Everywhere I am Boris. 
 -Shit, you're Russian, right? -No, Ukraine. Kiev is Ukraine. 
 -It's the same difference. -No, you're wrong. 
 What's the matter? You don't like being called Boris? 
 -Sergei. -No way! 
 Boris is way better. It's like the guy from the cartoon. Boris and Natasha? 
 Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle? 
 -You want some coffee, pie? -No, I'm good. 
 -Actually, what kind of pie you got? -Hey, Zig, shut the f*ck up, huh? 
 Sorry. 
 Who's that guy? 
 No, it's cool. He's cool. 
 -That's Frank's kid, huh? -Yeah. 
 He's in the union, you know, but he's, like, an L-series so he ain't getting any hours. 
 -Same deal, same rate. -All right. Who's driving? 
 Again? 
 You don't wanna mix it up a little more? Make it so Customs doesn't put no names to faces. 
 When you trust a man, you stay with him. 
 -OK. -All right. 
 -Boris it is. -Sergei. 
 Yeah, whatever. Come on, fuck-nuts. Let's go. 
 -How's the open-face turkey? -It's sh1t. Let's go. 
 See you guys later. 
 Bullwinkle? 
 Polacks. 
 You f*cking embarrassed me in there, man. 
 You embarrassed yourself, Zig. 
 ['50S POP ON RADIO] 
 You seen my nephew anywhere? 
 Nick? Not yet. I don't think he got any hours. 
 [MUFFLED POP] 
 -Hey, Frank. -Hey, darling. 
 Just so I can finish my paperwork early, what are your people gonna steal today? 
 I don't know. Couple luxury sedans, some color TVs, widescreen. 
 Couple of cans of vodka, maybe a whole container ship. 
 Okey-dokey. Y'all have a good one. 
 You let her f*ck with you like that? 
 She's all right. I like her. 
 [LOUD ROCK] 
 [MUSIC STOPS] 
 I checked the computer. It's Bay 9, Cell 11. It's right on the bottom. 
 -You working the Light, ain't you? -I'm on it. 
 -Did they say anything else? -No. Just that it's the same money to us. 
 Let's go. 
 All right, Uncle Frank. 
 -Winona. -Jimmy, where you been? 
 Jay? 
 Look who it is - Sailor Boy. You owe me ten. 
 f*ck you. You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go. You made it happen, Jay. 
 -I told him where you didn't wanna go. -And they sent me there. 
 I knew Rawls was pissed, I didn't know how pissed. What can I tell you? 
 -Where's Bunk? -Out on a call with Crutchfield. 
 That girl, she come off the bridge or what? 
 Doc Frazier posted her. Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest. 
 -Dead before she hits the water. -What about the defense wounds? 
 Bruising on three fingers. We saw that when we picked her up. 
 -You missed the defense wounds? -I wasn't looking. 
 -Thought she went off the bridge. -She has no coat or shoes on. 
 Maybe they came off in the water, maybe not. 
 I don't see her going to the bridge in winter dressed like she was, but that's just me. 
 Tell Bunk I was here, will you? Have fun. 
 We already had our fun. Dumping her on Baltimore County. 
 On the County? 
 You fished her out east of the bridge. Baltimore County. She's their stat. 
 -You sold them on that? -Rawls did. 
 He called up the Colonel, said, "You got one hell of a murder on your hands." 
 It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy. That's something you never learned. 
 Hey, Norris. State Police, line 2. 
 MAN: A little to the right. Good, good, bring her down. 
 It's there whenever they want it. 
 Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell, we are protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
 -I thought Roberto would be here. -Not likely. 
 This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers. 
 It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva has been targeted by the DEA. 
 That's why we didn't do the business? 
 Roberto and his people aren't going to be getting involved in anything that could complicate the situation. 
 Usually when you take a fall, you get back in there cause you know nobody's watching. 
 Sometimes. And sometimes you wonder how it is you got caught in the first place and you decide to change the pattern. 
 -He took our money. -Your payment arrived as our problem did. 
 I'm told the money is on the way back to Baltimore. 
 You know, I get the feeling that you're blaming us for Roberto's... Predicament. 
 Perhaps your problems in Baltimore and my client's problems here are coincidental. 
 -But right now... -Listen to me. 
 He was the first to know that we took a hit. 
 He knows no one came close to rolling over us and all the documents from the case. 
 Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern. 
 Considering the scope of Mr. Barksdale's operation, his sentence was, to say the least, mild. 
 But if the possibility exists, however unlikely, that the leniency he received was the result of cooperation... 
 Well, you understand our position, I'm sure. 
 Frank, it's sitting out there and this Russian f*ck won't take it off the pier. 
 I ain't blind. 
 I don't like it sitting out in the open that long. 
 The Customs seal is broke. Somebody'll see it. Our asses are hanging out here. 
 -Yeah? -Nicky, what the f*ck? It's still here. 
 -Shit. -Yeah. 
 -Where's Sergei? -Parked at the end of the lot. 
 -What's he waiting for? -No f*cking idea. 
 The ship's almost empty. They need to sh1t or get off the pot. 
 -I'll look into it. -Yeah. 
 OK, I understand. 
 [STARTS ENGINE] 
 Hey! 
 f*ck it. Get it on a fifth wheel and lose it in the stack. We're at risk. 
 [TYPING] 
 [COUNTRY] 
 -Hey. -Hey. 
 I ain't lying when I say this paperwork is kicking my ass. 
 Maybe so, but you come through the door in one piece. 
 You like to think so, but all these paper cuts are starting to take their toll. 
 Aw, you big, nasty detective. Come here. 
 Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss! 
 Oh. 
 -All this? -I'm just getting started. 
 $1,000 for the doctor. 
 $1,000 each time, girlfriend. Every month till I'm pregnant. 
 -There's gotta be a better way. -That would be on you, sweetheart. 
 Come up with a suitable donor and we pay a lot less. 
 Not with your pussy would I f*ck any of these guys. 
 What did you just say? You didn't just say that! 
 Sergeant. 
 Your floater's come back. County boys are putting her on our side of the bridge. 
 -No f*cking way. -Yeah. 
 Some useless f*ck in our Marine Unit faxed them a report on tides and wind currents. 
 Shows the body went in the water west of the bridge and drifted out. 
 McNulty. 
 f*cking Jimmy. f*cking with us for the fun of it. 
 I gotta give the son of a bitch some credit for wit on this one. 
 -Cocksucker. -Motherfucker. 
 [DISTANT SIREN] 
 The count is right. What's on the shelf? 
 Mace carrying ten down here, Moe Man holding about 38 up top. 
 I checked the stash, yo, and we way low. 
 -Moe Man taking our sh1t. -What he holding? 
 He said about 30-something, but I know that ain't right. I'm gonna f*ck him up. 
 First thing you think to do is f*ck a nigger up. 
 When your brick brain gonna realize there's more to this here than thumpin' on niggers? 
 -What Moe supposed to be holding? -38, thereabout. 
 -Ain't you the damn fool? -But then we low. 
 If we low, it's cause String want us that way. 
 When he want us up, we'll be up. Stringer's on top of this sh1t. 
 He on top of everything. 
 Go back to your spot, man. 
 f*cking McNulty. 
 The Prince of Tides. 
 [MUFFLED POP] 
 Brother, you feeling strong today? See if you can get his ass out of that chair. 
 He said it was fine if you want to hit him, too. 
 Hey, hey, hey. What's the first thing a guy from Local 47 does after he gets laid? 
 -What? -Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes! 
 Hey, Frank, something's going on. 
 [DISTANT SIRENS] 
 Come on. 
 [RETCHES] 
 -It's f*cking girls, man. Young ones. -A dozen of them. 
 Dead? They're dead?
