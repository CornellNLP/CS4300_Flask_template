 -Got that WMD here. -No. I want what you had the other day. 
 -This sh1t here? -You was calling it Bin Laden. 
 But now it's WMD. It will mass destruct your ass. 
 So this the hi-test? 
 Same sh1t, new name. You be all right. 
 Bang-bang-bang. Bang-bang-bang. 
 OK, get dressed. I pressed you some clothes and laid them out. 
 And don't forget that book bag neither. 
 You got your chrome, young 'un? 
 I'll take mine. 
 Y'all mind the crossfire, hear? Let's go. 
 -They coming up the alley! -They coming back! 
 Aim for the chest, brother. 
 Yo. Slide up. 
 Get down on that floor and stay there. 
 -You hear me, boy? -[BOY SHOUTS] OK, Mama. 
 -Come on! -Fuck! 
 sh1t! 
 -Why you running? -What the f*ck? 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Hit that nigger! 
 -Bitches! -Get down! 
 [SIRENS APPROACHING] 
 -Stay on it! -Shit! 
 Bitches! 
 That's right, come out. 
 Why you hiding? 
 -What's happening? -Come on! 
 -Move out, yo! -Yaaah! 
 [SIRENS BLARE] 
 Drama done with, boy. You gotta get yourself to school. 
 Get in, damn it! 
 TT, you hear me? Come on now. The drama's done. 
 Get your bags and get yourself to school. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I told you, you gotta get ready... 
 [SCREAMS] No! 
 When you walk through the garden You gotta watch your back Well, I beg your pardon Walk the straight and narrow track If you walk with Jesus He's gonna save your soul You gotta keep the devil Way down in the hole He's got the fire and the fury At his command Well, you don't have to worry If you hold onto Jesus' hand We'll all be safe from Satan When the thunder rolls We just gotta keep the devil Way down in the hole 
 Down in the hole 
 Down in the hole You gotta help me keep the devil Down in the hole 
 [TAPE FAST FORWARDS] 
 They're changing up? 
 MAN: Looking for my La-Z-Boys. Five you got for me, right? 
 -That shipment is tomorrow. -Got it. 
 That's what the warehouse was giving us. 
 Straight to the point drug talk. No muss, no fuss. Now listen. 
 WOMAN: Pyramid Incorporated. May I help you? 
 -You got them Davinas or what? -We no longer carry that line, sir. 
 Between us, we been sitting on that warehouse every minute since that truck came off the docks. 
 No players coming or going. No drug-related traffic. 
 To top it off, Sobotka hasn't used his cellphone since. 
 -We tipped our hand. -That second can. 
 The port police making a traffic stop spooked them. 
 Then we f*cked ourselves over nothing. 
 They dumped that can as a misdelivery. 
 -What? -They probably changed that up, too. 
 If they think we're onto them, they switch the can just to be safe. 
 And it goes off just to see if we pull them up. 
 Which we did... Which I did. 
 No, they're not on us completely. 
 If they were, they'd be shutting down and rolling out. 
 Instead, they're just sitting inside, turning away calls, waiting us out. 
 I, for one, am a patient m*therf*cker. 
 Don't waste film. 
 I been here so f*cking long that you're starting to look good to me. 
 Anything? 
 The drugs go in, they gotta come out. I mean, what the f*ck? 
 Little late. Used to be, when a nine-year-old hit the pavement, a district commander would be there in minutes. 
 We're living in a brave new world. 
 -I was in Washington with Burrell. -DC? What for? 
 Burrell took some district commanders down to DOJ. 
 Pimping ourselves for grant money. 
 So what do we got? 
 Nine-year-old catches a stray through the window. 
 -Dead? -Pronounced at University. 
 -Witnesses? -No names. 
 Two crews arguing over the real estate. 
 We got casings from three different calibers. 
 Your people in Tactical should hit the area drug corners and collect bodies. 
 -Fucking pointless. -We get enough shitbirds, this case can fall. 
 I ain't talking about that. I'm talking about this whole mess. 
 Been chasing this sh1t from one corner to the next like it's a plan. 
 Hit the corners, Howard. Take scalps. You'll feel better when you do. 
 You told us about WorldCom and the name change-up. You said... 
 I said change the name. I didn't say nothing about taking people off a corner. 
 We changed the name so many times that don't nobody come down no more. 
 And them Carrollton boys had it going on. 
 -Who shot the young 'un? -I don't know. 
 I don't think it was us. Them other niggers was going wild... 
 The cops are gonna have to bang some heads on this one. 
 They got to. That means we gotta shut everything down until this sh1t pass. 
 The towers, the low-rises. Everything gotta take a long f*cking time-out! 
 I know, String. 
 I'm sorry, man. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Let me tell you something, man. 
 This here game, it's more than the rep you carry, the corner you hold. 
 You gotta be fierce, I know that. 
 But more than that, you gotta show some flex. 
 Give and take on both sides. 
 -You hear me? -Yeah. 
 OK, anything that fired a bullet out on that corner has gotta disappear. 
 Not the storm drains. 
 Call that nigger Shamrock and drive all that chrome over to the harbor. 
 All right. 
 [RAP] 
 Coming up, yo. 
 [SPEAKING GREEK] 
 I got people waiting on a package, but Sergei says until we're sure about the police... 
 We're not going to be doing that business for a few days. 
 Your uncle, he is right to be careful. 
 But, Niko, if you are going to be doing this, -you should not be talking to us about it. -Why not? 
 We are more, what you call wholesalers. 
 I'm kind of small-time, huh? 
 [SPEAKS GREEK] 
 You are not so big, but you're among friends. 
 So. 
 Call that number. 
 -Talk to him. -Mike? 
 -This White Mike? -You know him? 
 From Curtis Bay. I went to Southern High School with the guy. 
 You are with us now, so he will be fair. No problem. 
 The rest of our business... 
 We will disappear these containers. All of them clean. 
 Take them to Newkirk Street. 
 If there is a problem, they will stop the trucks or we will see the police. 
 If not, no more worries. 
 All right. 
 We are off the warehouse phone now? 
 I've given the new number to our people. 
 This is bullshit. If they were onto the truck, they would've searched it. 
 Five-O! 
 Hey! Where you guys going? Come on, you know the deal. 
 Get the f*ck up against the wall! Hurry up. 
 Come on, keep moving. 
 Get him. Down. 
 This is bullshit, man. You know I ain't did nothing. 
 Everybody gets the special downtown. 
 One baloney sandwich and one white milk. 
 -Just shut the f*ck up. -Man, I'm clean, you hear me? 
 -What are you doing in the Pit? -Saying no to drugs. 
 Don't just say no to drugs, m*therf*cker. Say, "No, thank you." 
 Put your f*cking head down, step up and get in. 
 Sit down, stupid. Watch your head going in. Slide over, asshole. 
 Shame a kid had to get killed before we got around to doing this. 
 What exactly is it that we're doing? 
 MAN: Young boy killed over bullshit. 
 Now you got the police crawling all the way up your ass. 
 It's a good day to be an Eastside nigger, I gotta say. 
 Thing is, it ain't gonna happen like that if I take you up on your offer. 
 I'll be out there selling that real. My boys ain't gonna be scuffling. 
 They ain't gonna be standing on nobody else's corner, starting no sh1t. 
 You Westside. You must've heard of Charlie Sollers, right? 
 -No. -Goes back to Franklin and Fremont. 
 -All the way back to the '60s and sh1t. -Sollers? 
 Sold heroin like it was water. The m*therf*cker made some money. 
 I don't know who the f*ck you talking about. 
 I know you don't. And the police don't. 
 And the stick-up boys wouldn't have a f*cking clue. 
 Cause Charlie Sollers just sold dope. 
 No profile, no street rep. Just buy for a dollar, sell for two. 
 Sometimes, when your back up against the wall, you go to the gun. 
 I know. I been there. But you ain't gotta live by it. 
 Avon... 
 Avon a soldier. 
 That's who you want with you when the sh1t fly. But as far as business go... 
 -You still got that connect? -Right off the boat, String. 
 All right. I'm gonna buy from you at the price you paying... 
 And I'll let you walk that sh1t in the towers. 
 You can have 734, 770 and 221. 
 I keep the other three. 
 How you gonna tell it to Avon? 
 It makes sense, don't it? 
 He gonna hear something when it makes sense. 
 Right? 
 [QUACKING] 
 No sh1t. 
 -I thought you was in with Nicky. -Fuck Nick. 
 Said you was his other half. 
 I don't want his f*cking money. That's drug money. Drugs are bad. 
 Consider what that sh1t does to the community. 
 You spent all last year with White Mike. Remember? 
 A man can grow. 
 Besides, I got a caper that is gonna put that horseshit to shame. I'm telling you. 
 You want in? 
 -What do I gotta do? -What a longshoreman does best. 
 -Your duck won't touch Pikesville rye. -He drinks mid-shelf. 
 He don't like that rail sh1t. 
 f*ck if I wouldn't give my right leg for a shot and a beer. 
 -New Charles in the house. -Moving pretty good. 
 -I'm waiting on a prosthetic. -You got a lawyer? 
 Nat Coxson hooked me up through the union. 
 What's with the duck? 
 -Hey, Zig. -Charlie. 
 -You gotta let go of your name. -Say what? 
 Yeah, New Charles don't work for a one-legged f*ck. 
 Yeah, maybe "Stump". 
 -You know what? "Peg". -"New Peggy". 
 -How about "Tilt"? -Tilt? 
 Tilt. Just like a pinball machine. 
 Tilt. I like that. 
 ALL: Tilt. 
 I called a couple of nights ago. Told you I might be in town. 
 -WOMAN: So, this is your first time? -Yep, first time for me. 
 What do you do, Jimmy? Are you the police? Do you work with the police? 
 No. Christ, no. 
 No, I'm a traveling salesman. I travel and, you know... 
 -Where do you live? -I'm not gonna tell you that. 
 -I live out of town. -I don't think we can help you tonight. 
 Thank you. 
 You sucked. I mean, really. 
 f*ck if I thought I was gonna be interrogated. I'm just looking to get laid, right? 
 Hey, fucknuts. 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
 Christ, Ziggy. What the... Zig... 
 [SHOUTS] 
 Jesus, Zig. What the f*ck? 
 -What's up with my cousin? -Don't talk to me about that asshole. 
 -Drank himself to death. -Oh, sh1t. 
 What kind of fool would give a duck whiskey? 
 That boy ain't right. 
 His f*cking bird couldn't hold liquor for sh1t. 
 [BELCHING] 
 -La-Z-Boys? -And Davinas. Male and female. 
 -Dope and coke. -What's a Davina? 
 -It's like a love seat. -Any line on weight? 
 -All whole numbers. -No halves, quarters, eight-balls? 
 -Ounces? -What numbers they putting on the furniture? 
 Nothing much above five. 
 Proposition Joe has Ashland all the way up to North. Ten corners. 
 Five ounces wouldn't last him past lunch. 
 It's kilos. We're on the main stem. What was coming and going last night? 
 Not much. No trucks in, some cars in and out, but none of the drug players we saw before. 
 Whatever was in that last truckload probably went out in car trunks. 
 They're doing their distribution somewhere else. 
 Job one is to get back to a good phone. 
 The PC that got you the warehouse phone will get you anywhere else. 
 -All we need is the new number. -Any new lines in there? 
 -The phone people say no. -Probably going to a cellphone. 
 Best bet is to get the new number of the Russian's cellphone. 
 OK, then. Freamon and Prez, stay on one shift in the wiretap room. 
 Bunk and Russell, man the other. 
 Herc and Carver are on Newkirk Street to see if the warehouse traffic picks up. 
 McNulty and Greggs have the prostitution ring, but the people handling the girls have been cautious about fresh johns, so we're gonna need a new angle there. 
 Questions? 
 -What was your play with those girls? -Out-of-town salesman. 
 -How far out of town? -What do you mean? 
 The further out of town, the more they believe. 
 You do any accents? English, Scottish, something like that? 
 [BAD ENGLISH ACCENT] Crikey! I was looking to get a little hanky-panky and this bloke gave me this number to call when I got across the pond. 
 Work on it, son. Work on it. 
 200,000? That isn't a quarter of what they owe. 
 They will pay another two once their shipment clears the docks. 
 -And then? -That is all. 
 These Colombians are without honor, Spiros. They are cheats. 
 -The chemicals we sent are good, no? -No complaint. They want more, even. 
 And they understand we can guarantee their product clears Customs? 
 -Mm-hm. -Huh? 
 -And still, they try to chisel. -Why? What are they thinking? 
 That it is all profit for us. 
 That we will settle for half because 400,000 is still a lot of money. 
 The Greek will be angry. 
 This is business, Eton. The Greek? He will be smart. 
 -Got a charge? -We ain't got no charge, asshole. 
 Now shut the f*ck up. 
 -I didn't do sh1t. -Jesus. 
 You accidentally shoot one nine-year-old in his bedroom and the city gets its undies in a bunch. 
 To err is human, I say. 
 The mayor went to the scene last night. Said the crime will not stand. 
 -Tell him we got no eyeball witness. -How about the street talk? 
 Mentions of a 17-year-old, Bodie. Narcotics has him as Preston Broadus. 
 Why is young Preston not being hurled around one of our interrogation rooms? 
 We got cars on his grandma's as we speak. 
 What the f*ck you think you're dealing with here? Amateurs? 
 f*ck Nick. This is my thing. You want in, you gotta deal with me. 
 I got S-Class and SL-Class Benzes, roadsters, sedans, cabriolets. 
 Brand-new, keys in the ignition, nothing stripped. 
 -Off the docks? -No sh1t, off the docks. 
 Do I look like a f*cking car dealer? Twenty on the dollar. 
 But if we're gonna do this, I need you to order a minimum of three, or it ain't worth it for me. 
 Now, base price on an S430 starts at 73. 
 You round it, I get 15 for each car that you want. 
 A stolen car is a stolen car. Without title, who is going to pay even ten for it? 
 In Baltimore, maybe. But where you're from... 
 I bet you got family that don't give two f*cks whether or not an American car got a title on it. 
 It would be a sad state of affairs if an international entrepreneur like you didn't know what to do with a couple of extra Mercedes. 
 Big night for Jimmy McNulty. 
 Or should I say James Cromwell of Knightsbridge, Stepney and Mersey. 
 Excuse me? 
 Cromwell was the English f*ck who stole my ancestors' land and the others are all from rock and roll songs. 
 Ten tomorrow night, the shuttle comes for me on the parking lot off Russell Street. 
 Good work. 
 We'll get Greggs to wire you up. 
 Shame we're not up on a good phone. 
 Be nice to tickle the wire when we raid the brothel. 
 A little luck, maybe we get back up before then. 
 One other thing. 
 I'm kind of bothered that a Russian immigrant this deep in dirt doesn't have anything on the computer. 
 You still got that friend in Woodlawn? I'd like to know what the FBI has in its database. 
 After that meeting on the Barksdale case, I made a point of pissing him off. 
 So what? You do that to everybody. 
 George Glekas. He owns the appliance store where that second can landed. 
 Run his ass, too. 
 Cut another guy in and run them out the bobtail lane. 
 These babies start disappearing and everybody in the terminal is gonna suspect an inside job. 
 We need bolt cutters for the fence and then enough wood beams to make a track across the grass onto the road. 
 Why bother? We can run them cars over that patch of grass. 
 That ain't the plan. 
 -I just saw a can disappear. -Talco line? 
 -Pakusa working it? -It's him. 
 -Do we try to follow? -We know where it's going. 
 -12-08, you copy? -12-08. What's up? 
 We got a can that might be coming to you off the port. 
 Can number Paul-Mike-Quebec-Victor... 
 4-0-0-7-6-5, check digit two. 
 -What do you want us to do with it? -See if it arrives. 
 -And if it does? -See what happens then. 
 You wanna know something, Carv? 
 I'm starting to think that, as criminal investigators, we're not really respected. 
 That ain't necessary, Jimmy. 
 I knew we were f*cking the dog on that Barksdale thing. Who do I tell? 
 We got this new ASAC, thinks it's all about loyalty and ass-kiss. 
 It ain't like your agency. You piss them off, you ride the boat. Here... 
 Well, you find yourself assigned to some f*cking dustbowl Indian res in Arkansas. 
 -I was out of line, Fitz. -Fuck it. What you got there? 
 White boys. A different look for you. 
 They're all showing clean. What's the chance of that? 
 NCIC and NADDIS are a dead end. 
 Customs had a little intel on this guy, Glekas. 
 -Customs has intel on him? -Mm-hm. 
 Should show here. Let me try something else with it. 
 This'll give us any contact he might have had with us. 
 -Something out of San Diego. -On Glekas? 
 Let's see. 
 I call Hyattsville, I need three forms and a lieutenant's approval. 
 Agent Ernest Koutris, please. 
 Believe me, we ain't short on paperwork here either. Agent Koutris? 
 Not much to it. We pulled his chain in a stolen goods case I worked in '95, '96. 
 He was just crumbs, so no charges. But I did an interview. 
 The guy struck me as just a mope playing it slick. 
 Yeah, I can send you what I got. 
 All right. If you need it, let me know. 
 [RINGING TONE] 
 [SPEAKS GREEK] We need to talk. 
 Anyone following? 
 Run up and down the street. Take tag numbers from cars. 
 -All week I've done it. Nothing. -Again. 
 The truck is here. 
 Lester, it's here. 
 -They off-load anything? -Not yet. 
 OK, wait on it. 
 See, the thing about it, Preston, is that you're unbelievably stupid. 
 I don't say it to upset you. Just to state a fact. 
 He doesn't think so. 
 Nobody ever thinks they're stupid. It's part of the stupidity. 
 You don't need to tell us what happened. We know. 
 We got you, we got your guns, we got the whole f*cking story. 
 Where that lawyer at, man? 
 You just f*cked up. Way you looked at the bag, you know what's in there. 
 That's you, right there, f*cking up. 
 -I don't know what you talking about. -You f*cked up. 
 We even got your prints on one of the guns. We even got that. 
 Which one? 
 That's you right there. 
 Lawyer. 
 They were asking about me? 
 [SPEAKS GREEK] 
 San Diego. 
 San Diego was a long time ago. 
 Our friend in Washington does not know why. Only that they asked. 
 You told me the police looking into the women were local. 
 They were. No FBI. 
 -We've been running clean containers? -Yes. No one watches, no one follows. 
 -No one stops anything. -We changed the warehouse phone? 
 A day or two more, and we are back to business. 
 We watch, we are careful. But we are back to business. 
 We will have to do a favor for our friend. Fair is fair. 
 The Colombians, I think. 
 They take our chemicals and pay less than promised. 
 Down there, I understand everyone is a terrorist now. 
 Judges are killed. Bombs go off in the street. It's very bad. 
 The Colombians who cheated us are not with the guerrillas. 
 They're trash. 
 The world is a smaller place now. 
 And the FBI cares very much about such things. 
 Fair is fair, eh? 
 [PHONE] 
 Sergei's making a call. 
 -Yes? -Another box tomorrow, but clean. 
 Clean, yes. 
 If there is no problem, bring in the La-Z-Boys. I will meet you. 
 -Recognize that voice? -The man from the warehouse phone. 
 -That's the same guy? -Same guy, new number. 
 -[CHUCKLES] -Who you calling? 
 Pearlman, at home. Another affidavit and we're back on the main stem. 
 sh1t is raw, String. I mean, you can stomp on this m*therf*cker. 
 All right. When them police stop busting heads in them towers, you let Prop Joe's people take the three of them. 
 All right. 
 OK, add the DNR stuff to the boilerplate, and you're there. 
 Connect the dots and you have to ask yourself what these guys aren't into. 
 -Drugs, women, stolen goods. -FBI didn't have much. 
 Something out of San Diego on Glekas in a stolen goods case. 
 San Diego? These guys move around. 
 -What's with the suit? -Date night. 
 Undercover at the brothel. 
 Run like hell, ma'am. 
 We wanna be up on that phone to hear what we hear after tonight's raid. 
 Who's the affiant? 
 [WHISTLES] 
 Can you get the SL-series in Pacific Blue? That would be best. 
 -Whatever you need, chief. -I don't care about the color of this. 
 Ain't a problem. They all just gotta have sunroofs. 
 -It's a long story. -Next Tuesday would be good for us. 
 A ship comes Wednesday early, so... 
 Listen... You think I can get an advance on this? 
 I got some expenses right now, and I'm a little tapped. 
 -I'm just asking. -Payment on delivery. 
 Don't worry about it. I would never cheat a smart businessman like yourself. 
 It ain't enough that I gotta think this whole sh1t through. 
 That I gotta be the one looking out for this sh1t and that sh1t. 
 Checking up, making sure this sh1t is done. No, that's not enough. 
 That's why they be paying them f*cking CEOs so much money. 
 Because when the sh1t fall bad, it all fall bad on them. 
 Everybody else can be ducking and hiding, doing what they f*cking wanna do. 
 But when push come to shove, I'm the one who's got to take that responsibility and y'all are leaving me very little to work with. 
 -Hold up, String... -No, that's a simple thing, my nigger. 
 You drive the guns to the water. You look around, you ain't see anybody, you throw the guns... In the water. 
 Splash. 
 Now, get the f*ck out of here, man. 
 Except you, young 'un. 
 
 
 
 You ain't say sh1t? 
 No, they f*cked up when they told me my prints was on a gun. 
 I wiped them sh1ts down myself. And the one they said was mine wasn't even. 
 If they would've had anything past my name, they would've kept me, right? 
 -All right. -All right, String. 
 Lock that door. 
 You got a bolt cutter? I need a good one. 
 Got two in the window there. 
 You hung this on a duck? 
 Of course. 
 1,200. 
 Fair enough. 
 -Nick. -It's been a while, Mikey. 
 Yeah, it has. But your name's been in my mind lately. 
 Yeah? 
 My man called. Said you was gonna take a re-up from me. 
 Yeah, that's what they told me, too. 
 Nicky Sobotka, living the life. Who f*cking knew? 
 -How much you looking for? -Two or three G-packs a week. 
 I was getting that from the Greek's people. Four each. 
 Four? I wholesale for five, man. 
 I don't know. They told me you was gonna be straight with it, so... 
 Sergei. What up, dawg? 
 I got a friend of yours here says we're giving Gs at four. Yeah? 
 All right, f*ck it. Yeah, it's fine. 
 Another thing. 
 I wanna know it wasn't your people dropped that body over on Potee Street. 
 I'm asking cause it was someone with a Greek-ass name and f*cked if he wasn't dumped by a house I was using. 
 Did he have hands? Did he have a face? 
 Yes? Then it wasn't us. 
 Idiot. 
 You got friends in high places, Nicky. 
 -Four a pack for you. -All right, cool. 
 MAN: Thank God for the Russian's cellphone. 
 They might be laying off the warehouse, but he ain't changing. 
 SERGEI: Did he have hands? Did he have a face? 
 Yes? Then it wasn't us. 
 -What the f*ck is that? -PEARLMAN: It's a man's purse. 
 European men like yourself sometimes carry one. 
 Mm. 
 Them people ain't right over there. 
 The mic has to go somewhere. 
 Besides, you might have hands all over you before we get what we need. 
 Indeed I might, luv. 
 It'll be your call when we come through the doors. 
 You want us in, you say... What was it? 
 "Spot on." It means "exactly". 
 Remember, they have to bring up the money and s*x first, then an overt attempt to... Engage. 
 Spot on. 
 Detective Freamon with Baltimore Homicide. 
 What do you guys have in VICAP for male victims, headless or faceless, and missing both hands? 
 -State? -Middle Atlantic region. 
 Four and a half million in the capital budget that's set to pass House and Senate. 
 -Money'll be allocated for next year. -Congratulations, Frank. 
 What kind of stevedore drinks champagne? 
 So, Nat, about the election. 
 I just need one more year to bring the dredging home. 
 -Ott's turn, Frank. -[DOOR OPENS] 
 Frank. This is Agent Koutris of the FBI in Washington. 
 He's with the counter-terrorism people down there. 
 -Terrorism? -He needs our help tonight. 
 Some enchanted evening You will see a stranger You will see a stranger... 
 11 -34, what's your 20? 
 -BUNK: I'm at the overpass on Wicomico. -Copy that. 
 [SINGS] 
 OK, we're on here. 
 Good evening. 
 Paint pigments. They ship them in for the SCL plant down at Fairfield. 
 It's in there somewhere. Run it. 
 Same consistencies on all the barrels. 
 -Nothing else in there. -Nothing but the pigments. 
 -What's going on? -I don't know nothing, Horse. 
 Swear to God. Tonight I'm just a dumb white boy from Locust Point. 
 I'm saying this out of respect, Bri. 
 I love the man like my brother, but for something like this, he gonna listen to you more than me. 
 You think so? 
 All I put in his ear about my son didn't do a damn thing, did it? 
 I told him that he needed to do more for D'Angelo... And what happened? 
 He feel for that. 
 He feel for you. 
 I know he didn't see it coming. 
 -None of us seen it coming. -I did. 
 I swear, I saw it. 
 He ain't listen to me then. Why you think he gonna listen now? 
 Cause we got a weak product and we holding on to prime real estate with no muscle. 
 I don't got Wee-Bey, Stinkum, Bird. 
 I know that your heart is heavy. 
 Hm? 
 I know. 
 But them wolves is at that door. 
 As long as them towers are still standing, I am, too. 
 And I'll be damned if I let everything we fought for go to sh1t. 
 So I'll talk to him. 
 [CHAMBER MUSIC] 
 Mr. Cromwell. 
 Decisions, decisions. 
 Would it be wrong to take two? 
 Attaboy. 
 We should get upstairs. 
 Nothing but paint pigments. 
 MAN: Trust me, old friend. It's there. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 OK, then. 
 [LAUGHS] Right. Er... 
 Maybe, we could, erm... Talk about this first? 
 Yeah? 
 Hang on. Erm... 
 We, er... 
 -Any time you guys want. -The money changed hands, right? 
 Sounded that way. 
 -And they talked about s*x? -Definitely. 
 Any time you guys want... Hang on. 
 Oh, God. 
 -Jesus Christ. -Is it soup yet? 
 -Spot something. Spot on it. -Let's go. 
 -Whoa. Why? -We're supposed to get in quick. 
 Calm the f*ck down. They ain't gonna flush a half-dozen whores down the toilet. 
 -WOMAN: Who is it? -Baltimore Police. 
 -What do you want? -To lock your ass up. 
 Hands. Let me see 'em. Hands. 
 -Two more in the back. -Come on, ladies. 
 [GROANING] 
 You're late. 
 -He OK? -He'll live. 
 WOMAN: ...estimated at 1, 125 kilograms of processed crack cocaine is estimated to be in excess of $45 million. 
 Federal officials have confirmed that their investigation is ongoing and that while no arrests have been made, the seizure itself has severely disrupted the operations of a group believed to have ties to Colombian terrorist... 
 That, gentlemen, is a case. 
 God forbid you should put something like that on my friend Frank Sobotka. 
 -I would die happy. -[LAUGHTER] 
 -Our case is progressing. -Great. What can you charge? 
 We're not at that point. 
 We've got wires into an operation linked to drugs and women. 
 In all likelihood, the people bringing in the girls who were dead in that can two months ago. 
 We're on one location we believe is a transshipment point for narcotics. 
 And last night, you'll see we hit a brothel that we also think ties in. 
 A month or two more on the taps and DNRs and we will identify the top-end players. 
 -You hit a brothel? -Waterfront condo, high-end. 
 Jesus. 
 If you find anything that looks like a list of steady customers, flush it. 
 Half the names in the Maryland Manual are probably on it. 
 Any problems on the raid? 
 A complication or two. Nothing we can't write around. 
 Immigration is holding the girls. 
 The madam, who has legal residency, we cut loose on bail. 
 -You try to interview them? -Not while the taps are up. 
 Better to let them think it was random and see what's said on the wire today. 
 Cut to the chase. You any closer on my murders? 
 If these are the people who were importing those girls, then we're closer. 
 The more we learn, the more chance we have to clear those cases. 
 What about Frank Sobotka? I'm not hearing his name in here anywhere. 
 The union may be involved in the smuggling, but it doesn't go past that. 
 -This is about Frank Sobotka. -The case is bigger now. 
 Look, missy, this is my detail. I started it. 
 Now, I'm asking, do you have charges on Frank Sobotka? 
 Charging Sobotka now would lose us a chance at the real targets. 
 -He is the real target. -Patience, Stan. 
 -I'm sure if they bring the case... -You owe me on this, Erv. 
 You asked for a detail, I gave you a detail. 
 You asked for Daniels, I gave you Daniels. 
 OK. So, now the votes are in and you're moving your golf trophies upstairs to the commissioner's office, now you're freezing me out, huh? 
 f*cking rat fuckers, all of you. 
 This is my case. Mine! 
 And now you're gonna tell me who the target is? 
 Not f*cking likely. 
 WOMAN: He's saying no. He's saying we fought for every one of them towers and to give them up now would mark us as weak. 
 He says if we do this, Prop Joe would have it over on us and we might never get out from under. 
 We don't have the product or the muscle. 
 I told him. I did. 
 He say he still trying to find us a better connect. 
 And for muscle... He's saying he sending us the best he can find. 
 Brother Mouzone. 
 He sending in Brother? 
 From New York. Coming down to work on retainer, for as long as we need. 
 -Brother Mouzone? -Yep. 
 [SIGHS] 
 "At which point the officer was unable to resist" 
 "the ministrations of the aforementioned suspect" 
 "and found himself brought to the point of a sexual act." 
 [LAUGHS] You're famous behind this, you know that? 
 As a pervert, this report is gonna make you a BPD legend. 
 I can't perjure myself. I gotta explain it. 
 You have violated a half-dozen departmental regs right there. 
 And no state's attorney is gonna bring this into court. 
 The girls are being deported. We did the raid just to tickle the wire. 
 There were two of them. I was outnumbered. 
 You f*cking with me, right? 
 Brother Mouzone, from NYC? 
 I told Avon I didn't have enough muscle to hold down them towers. 
 -And he reached out. -Joe, I'm holding on to this deal. 
 -This is just sh1t we gotta deal with. -Deal with how? 
 I would take the m*therf*cker out, but Avon can't know it came from me. 
 You don't think I'm gonna send any of my people up against Brother? sh1t. 
 That nigger got more bodies on him than a Chinese cemetery. 
 True. 
 Look, I'm just saying, this your problem, not mine. 
 You want my product, you deal with it. 
 All right. We got some time here. 
 Avon gotta send the word and wait for word to come back, set up a price, talk to Brother Mouzone, set up the whole sh1t. 
 That's a week or maybe two. 
 By then, your people's gonna be in the towers and if the money's right then that is what it is. 
 Ain't no nigger from New York gonna change the facts from the ground. 
 -12-08 to 11 -37, you there? -11 -37, what you got? 
 That last truck is on the move. It sits there for days and they don't off-load a thing. 
 -10-4. -They're testing us. Moving clean cans. 
 -[PHONE] -[SPEAKS GREEK] 
 -The trash hasn't drawn any flies. -No? 
 -We took out the last of it. No problems. -OK, then we go. 
 -What about Ilona? -She is home. They kept the children. 
 There are always more children. 
 Why don't we tap that cellphone, even if we don't know who we're tapping? 
 That call might just be our PC. 
 And this here is the little king of everything. 
 So how many we got in this sector? 
 Double shift, plus the Flex Squad, DEU... and a dozen guys Tactical sent us. 
 We're on every corner. 
 Pretty damn quiet today. 
 Today. 
 Let's go. 
 Officer.
