 Hannah [over podcast]: This is Invisibilia, I'm Hannah Rosen. 
  Alix: And I'm Alix Spiegel. 
  Hannah: Invisibilia is a show about all the invisible forces that shape human behavior. 
  And today, as part of our concept album, we're talking about reality bubbles. 
  Most of us live in one. 
  It's our little corner of the world filled with the ideas and the people that we believe in, and that we like best. 
  Alix: And until recently, how completely we lived in these reality bubbles and the concepts that both created and sustained them wasn't entirely clear to us. 
  But then came the election, and our bubbles suddenly felt like a problem. 
  A lot of people were suddenly aware that they weren't ever even exposed to concepts or ideas that were clearly influencing other people. 
  Hannah: So, we offer you now a practical guide to bubble hopping.

  Yeah, I get that. 
  But, you know, you can't just go f*cking cold turkey with a flip phone, you know? 
  You probably gotta, like, step into it. 
  You know what you could do? 
  I have these other clients who do a totally tech-free evening one night a week. 
  No tech, no electricity.
