  ♪ SPEED: Let's, uh, jump on in now, folks. 
  I love starting the walking tour standing still, because this way we're our own natural, organic Greek chorus, walking around our own unfolding Greek drama. 
  And just like any Greek chorus in relationship to its unfolding plot, we'll be participating, observing, commenting, but never really committing, if you know what I mean. 
  As, most importantly, the walking tour is designed to be an intimate soirée that waltzes across this vast alienation... 
  Hey, people are trying to get to work, you dumb M*therf*ckers! 
  Welcome! 
  Let's charge off now into the great random choreography that appears five times a week: Rush Hour, starring neurosis, the mediocre psychedelic trip guiding all of this. 
  Off to your right, Central Park.

  Thank you all so much for coming. 
  As you know, this is our first-ever New York agent showcase, and the kids are so darned excited to meet you. 
  Thank you so much for coming and making their dreams come true. 
  Uh, and now the great work begins. 
  Oh, I'm... 
  I'm sorry. 
  Uh, okay, I'm... 
  I... 
  I'll just collect your... 
  your forms, uh, that you filled out, and if you didn't, please do, uh... 
  Thank you so much. 
  I'm Leonard Tully, as I said, and my picture and reésumé's not in your packet, but I've got a stack of them backstage if anybody wants one. 
  Thanks. 
  [Laughing]: I'm kidding. 
  Oh. 
  hi. 
  Hi, hi, hi, hi. 
  Don't go, I wanna sit and talk to you. 
  [Whispering]: Okay, I'll see you back there. 
  I'm gonna hang on to mine, thanks. 
  Okay.

  So good, so good. 
  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
  Thanks, thanks. 
  They... 
  Listen, you gotta go out and mingle 'cause they're dying to meet a real live actor. 
  Okay, okay. 
  Told 'em all about you. 
  Curtis: I'm telling you, all you need is a couple of good knives and a big pot so you can make soup for the whole week. 
  What about getting an agent? 
  Oh, that'll happen when it happens. 
  But in the meantime, you better get yourself a roommate and get into soup!

  Listen, do you have any tips or thoughts I should pass along to them? 
  Uh, um... 
  Oh, I loved that song from Dear Evan Hansen. 
  Oh, my God, it's so good. 
  Actually, I've got to get back to the office. 
  Oh. 
  It really was so great to see you, Leonard! 
  Thank you. 
  I'll let you know if there's interest, but, you know, we're boutique, so we can only take on so many. 
  Of course, of course. 
  Look, I know how show business works. 
  Oh, whoa, whoa...

  Yeah.

  What did she say? 
  Does she want to meet any of us or... ? 
  Well, here's the thing... 
  here's the thing about agents is that they work in a clump, and so... 
  Leonard, do we get to see our sheets? 
  Well, you know, guys, I want you to meet my friend Curtis. 
  We did Angels together at the Old Globe. 
  He has amazing stories, and he'll be able to really tell you some things that I can't. 
  Just listen and learn. 
  And if they want you in a cock sock, you wear a cock sock. 
  And there ain't nothing you can do about it. 
  Hopefully, it's the right size. 
  I didn't even see you here, girl. 
  Now, let me tell you right now, look at these freckles. 
  You let people see them freckles, because it's what makes you different, it's what makes you good. 
  Leonard: What the hell is this? 
  Do you know what NVS means? 
  Curtis: What's the context? 
  Leonard: It's what some of the agents wrote on the kids' forms. 
  NVS or NVG next to everybody's name except Sunny's. 
  Well, I don't know. 
  It's "New Verging Singer," "Now Very Strong," "Nubile Versatile Songstress." Or, uh, "Nice Vertical Stance." Yeah. 
  Yeah, something like that. 
  Cyclist: Heads up! 
  Really? 
  Dumb m*therf*cker! 
  [Laughing]: Wow! 
  Oh, it is so great to be back in New York! 
  God, I haven't been here since the Pleistocene Age. 
  Every goddamn break I had, I had to go to Alex's family. 
  Oh, how is Alex? 
  [Sighs] 
  Curtis! 
  We broke up! 
  I told you all about it on Facebook. 
  No, no, no. 
  You know I don't go on that sh1t. 
  Well, it's been about eight months. 
  It's been really rough. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Yeah. 
  But, you know, everything's for a reason and the timing couldn't be better because my sabbatical's coming up and, you know, New York's always been my white whale. 
  And so I'm thinking maybe now's the time to dust off my Capezios and the 16 bars and press some flesh in the Equity Lounge and see if there are any parts for 200-year-old men. 
  ♪ ♪ Don: This boy comes wobblin' down the street, and I say to him, "Hey now, what's all the fuss?" [Phone chimes] 
  And now he says to me, he's looking for a hospital, can I help him? 
  And so I say, there hasn't been a hospital around here in 20 years. 
  Yeah. 
  But then, of course, that Urgent Care is like a hospital, and that's just two blocks away, you know. 
  I told him so. 
  Always wondered what happened to that boy. 
  Yeah, I do too. 
  Mm. 
  Uh, I don't wanna change the subject or anything, but do you think this is gonna be an expensive fix? 
  And if it is, do you think you'll be able to take it off my hands if it's f*cked? 
  [Sighing]: Oh. 
  Uh... 
  We'll see about the engine. 
  Okay. 
  The rest seems to be in good shape. 
  You should keep it. 
  I don't know, man. 
  It's pretty high-maintenance.

  You still thinking about that? 
  Let it go. 
  Curtis, you once told me you didn't need talent to make it, that if you were persistent and everybody would leave and then you'd get all the parts 'cause there'd be nobody left. 
  I said that? 
  Yeah, and it worked out for you. 
  If you're gonna talk, go to the bar. 
  Plenty of people want to sing at the piano. 
  I'm not gonna leave till you play my song. 
  Okay, take it easy, Blanche.

  Come on, I can sing as well as these guys can.

  ♪ ♪ SPEED: A city is what happens once a landscape needs to order in. 
  New York City, great example. 
  The Collect Pond is the original drinking water downtown. 
  It gets polluted, they build a canal to siphon off the polluted water into the river: Canal Street. 
  Then comes the invention of private water companies that specialize in bringing drinkable water to the population. 
  And that right there, that's when it becomes New York City. 
  Yeah, baby! 
  For this city, from its very beginnings has been a gigantic ordering-in situation.

  ♪ ♪ SPEED: I suppose if I had an essential goal on the cruise right now, it would be to exhibit the fact that I'm thrilled to be alive and to still be respected. 
  I suppose the soulful or the Buddhist out there might ask, "Why do you need respect from others? 
  "The thrill to be alive, that's your own business. 
  You can do that in your living room." But that's not what the cruise is for me. 
  The cruise is about the searching for everything worthwhile in existence. 
  I mean, I will appreciate the beauty of a flower, and then likewise, I will stand exhibitionistic and have the flower appreciate the beauty of me. 
  Well, that's how I feel about cruising right now. 
  And I would say having a quote, unquote, "intimate love affair" with a flower is far more psychotic and riveting than having an "intimate love affair," quote, unquote, with some of the banal creatures of the human race. 
  Although, I'd be into that, too. 
  Yeah, I don't know...
