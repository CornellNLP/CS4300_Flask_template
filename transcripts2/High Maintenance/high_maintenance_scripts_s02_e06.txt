 The sativas go pretty quickly... 
  [door creaks, closes] 
    so I'm gonna give you a little Green Crack   and put that in the back of the case, uh, right by the cookies. 
    Crack in the back. 
    And I'm out of sativa cartridges, so I have these hybrids, but it's Sunday, so I think it's okay. 
     I don't think it'll be too crazy. 
     It should be fine. 
  Also, I was thinking it might be easier    if I just pull up, call them, and then they come down, hop in the whip, and we drive around the block. 
     I mean, that seems a little out in the open. 
     I don't know. 
  I'm not worried about it. 
     Everybody else does it like that. 
     But then you miss the insides of the apartment, which is, like, kind of the best part. 
     I just think it's gonna be faster, man. 
     Yeah, yeah, you're probably right. 
     - We can do that, yeah. 
  - Cool. 
     Um, I rolled you some Js man. 
     Figured with the arm and everything... 
     That is so nice. 
  Thank you so much. 
     - I really... 
  - How could I leave you high and dry, man? 
     - Look at you. 
  - You'll just leave me high. 
     [both laugh] 
  Indeed. 
     So, we're gonna try this burner thing. 
     Don't respond to an unknown number unless there's a referral first, okay? 
     I got robbed like that, so... 
     - Got it. 
  You're the boss. 
  - All right. 
     You already know the combination, got all that. 
     I got you some extra cash here. 
  Oh. 
     If they buy five, they get the sixth free, so, it's a promo. 
     Are there any nuts in the cookies? 
     No, there are no nuts in the cookies. 
     You are so conscientious, man. 
     I know. 
  I've literally never known anyone with a nut allergy, and I still freak out about it all the time. 
     It's gonna come in handy one day. 
     All right, I'm gonna head out. 
     I gotta give my lady a ride to work before I get started. 
     - This everything? 
  - Mmhmm. 
     - All right, man. 
  - All right. 
  Thanks, man. 
     You take care of that arm, huh? 
     - I will. 
  I will. 
  - All right, I'll see ya. 
     All right. 
  Yeah. 
     Hey, you need the phone. 
     Oh! 
  My bad. 
     - Part of the... 
  Part of the thing. 
  - I need that.

  Don't worry, huh?

  Oh! 
  f*ck! 
     [sighs] 
     And the password is Mom's birthday, right? 
  [keyboard clacks] 
     Yeah, that worked. 
  Thanks, Dad. 
     Also, you should probably not use that password for everything, or at least make it backwards or something. 
     - Yeah. 
  -  So, how do you get to be the king? 
     -  It ain't like that. 
  - [sighs] 
   Yeah, I'm okay. 
   It was bound to happen sometime, 
   so I'm just hanging at home today.
