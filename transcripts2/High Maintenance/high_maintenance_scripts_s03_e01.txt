  ♪ ♪ Suzanne: He wanted to die young, though. 
  He told me he hoped he didn't make it past 40. 
  But that was when we were dating, like a million years ago. 
  I'm sorry. 
  This is my husband, Bill. 
  Hi. 
  Jerry. 
  Suzanne: Bill and I both teach poli-sci at Vassar. 
  Suzanne: How'd you know Berg? 
  Jerry: We met at the college radio station 15 years ago. 
  He sold me pot ever since. 
  Oh, sounds about right. 
  But every time I'd call him out on that funny smell wafting in our windows, he'd say, "Who me? 
  There's skunks everywhere, man." He taught me guitar, but it's not like we ever got to the lessons or anything. 
  I know, I know. 
  "Let me twist one up for us, Baba." Yeah. 
  "Forget about the notes, man. 
  Let's jam!" "Life is funny... 
  " Both: "Bees make honey!" Sal: What a guy. 
  Joy: Oh, my gosh. 
  That sweet, man. 
  Oh, I'm gonna miss him. 
  But it's beautiful to see all these people here. 
  [Joy continues indistinctly] 
  [Softly]: I got you something, Baba. 
  [Chattering, laughing] 
  Yo. 
  What's up, man? 
  Hey. 
  How are you? 
  I'm doin' good, man. 
  Good to see you. 
  It's been a while. 
  Man, I can't even remember the last time I saw you. 
  I think it was... 
  You were with a guy from Kentucky on a motorcycle. 
  Right. 
  Yeah, man. 
  Dude, you and your wife were here, camping in a tent on the lawn. 
  Oh yeah. 
  Good memory. 
  What's up, man? 
  How are you? 
  You know, I mean, I'm growing in the Berkshires now. 
  Really? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Goddamn, I keep forgetting Massachusetts is legal, and, like, right there. 
  It's f*cking crazy, dude. 
  I mean, I spent years smoking Berg-schwag, but this past year, I've been supplying him with the kindest bud you ever saw. 
  Really? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  You know, maybe I should get your number. 
  I'm always looking for, like, uh, someone to hang out with. 
  For sure. 
  I know what you mean. 
  Hey! 
  Hey. 
  I think this is for you. 
  That's your RV outside, right? 
  Yeah. 
  Oh, wow, that is me. 
  Yeah. 
  I found it when I was cleaning up. 
  Man, I was supposed to come up this week, but, uh... 
  I guess I just missed him. 
  You know, this is a great party, Cori. 
  Thanks. 
  It's really cool. 
  I want to put this pie down. 
  Suzanne: Anyway, I... 
  I don't actually think that he was lonely. 
  That man had a very rich interior life and world. 
  He kept his cup very full, and I feel like one of the lucky people he gave a drink to. 
  [Chuckling] 
  Woman: Yeah. 
  Suzanne: To Berg. 
  All: To Berg! 
  Greg: Whoa, heh. 
  Getting smoky in here. 
  Suzanne: Goddamn right! 
  Um, thanks for coming everyone. 
  It's really awesome to be with a bunch of people who loved Berg. 
  Uh, I'm Cori. 
  I was his friend, and I was his neighbor for the last couple of years. 
  I live upstairs. 
  And we had this weekly ritual of... 
  Well, it was more like a daily ritual of getting stoned. 
  [Laughter] 
  And we would watch old episodes of Doctor Who together. 
  And I would bring over a nice beer, and he would order a pizza from Emiliano's... 
  an onion pizza, just onions. 
  [Laughter] 
  But I'm rambling now. 
  Um... 
  You know, like, Berg didn't have much in the way of blood family, and he and I had that in common... 
  [Voice breaking]: but he was, like, better than any family. 
  Better than any family that I've ever known. 
  And the thing that I appreciate about... 
  appreciate about him is that he never judged me for anything. 
  Woman: Yeah, that's right. 
  He... 
  He didn't judge anyone, did he? 
  So... 
  Woman: No. 
  He just, like, would let you be... 
  exactly the kind of person that you needed to be. 
  Like, you didn't have to clean up your place for him. 
  [Laughter] 
  He just was easy. 
  [Crying]: And he was my friend, so... 
  Cori: To Berg. 
  All: To Berg! 
  I'll go. 
  Come on, everyone. 
  Let's jam! 
  Wait. 
  I was gonna... 
  [Cheering] 
  Rita: What should we play? 
  He always ended every radio set with "Crimson and Clover." [Cheers, applause]

  That brings back memories.

  I was just seeing if maybe Berg had decided to stick around in here. 
  You know, he left his body while he was in a bath. 
  Oh, wow. 
  I didn't know that. 
  I can let you have your privacy. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  It's all right. 
  I'm sure he's still circulating this party...

  Oh, yeah. 
  Amazing. 
  Sorry, I'm coming at you like some fiend. 
  It's not for me, it's for my friend. 
  The Guy: Aw, man. 
  Yeah, this is Nigel. 
  He's got a problem. 
  I'm Lee. 
  I'm totally cool. 
  [Chuckles] 
  Hi, Lee. 
  I'm... 
  [Coughing] 
  Oh, I'm sorry. 
  You okay? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Want so... 
  Want some more? 
  No. 
  [Laughing]: No, I do not. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  It's all right. 
  So, color consultant. 
  Do you have like... 
  mental associations with colors? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Like, are you a synesthete? 
  A little bit. 
  I mean, there are some associations. 
  It's not... 
  It's... 
  I don't necessarily, like, uh, hear green. 
  But if I said the number six, would you have a color in mind? 
  Hmm... 
  curry. 
  Curry. 
  What about summertime? 
  Peach. 
  Ooh. 
  Loneliness? 
  Indigo, definitely. 
  Yeah. 
  I like this RV. 
  Yeah, it's awesome. 
  I love it. 
  I've been just chillin' for like the last two weeks.

  Having the time of my f*cking life. 
  What's up, buddy? 
  Hey, buddy! 
  Oh, he's hungry. 
  We gotta feed him. 
  Do you want to eat? 
  [Growling] 
  [Growling continues] 
  What, does he have to answer before you feed him? 
  Do you... 
  do you want to eat? 
  Do you? 
  Well, you were looking at the dog. 
  Right, and then I turned... 
  I pivoted my head and looked at you. 
  Well, now you're looking at me. 
  Now I'm looking at you. 
  Do you want to eat? 
  Okay.

  Um, I loved this. 
  Can I have a growler to take home? 
  Yeah, you got it. 
  Thank you. 
  Cori: Hey, sorry. 
  I said onions. 
  Not veggie, just onions. 
  Man: Ah, sorry Cori. 
  No problem. 
  Don't forget me. 
  Oh.

  Well, I don't know. 
  You want to get married? 
  Uh... 
  Technically, I'm not divorced yet. 
  Well, you know, it takes a while. 
  Uh-huh. 
  At least a year sometimes. 
  Yeah. 
  I'd prefer it didn't take so long.

  Oh, no. 
  We're friends.

  There's just a place in town that I need to go to get the good eggs, 'cause if you don't get there by a certain time, they're all gone. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Well...

  [Laughing]: Really? 
  I needed this, too. 
  You did. 
  I could tell you needed it. 
  Hey, uh... 
  This is kind of funny, but, um... 
  I saw you buy gas for that mom the other day. 
  Huh. 
  That was you, right? 
  Wait, really? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  I can't believe you saw that. 
  You do that a lot? 
  No. 
  Well... 
  no. 
  Funny thing I didn't mention is that I'm... 
  pregnant. 
  Really? 
  Yep. 
  Is that a good thing?

  Messy? 
  It's pretty messy. 
  It's my ex's, so... 
  You okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I will be. 
  You know, what they say about pregnancies is, "No big deal." [Laughing] 
  They do say that, don't they? 
  Like... 
  [Scoffs] 
  Whatever. 
  Yeah. 
  Life is funny. 
  Bees make honey. 
  Yeah, that's true. 
  Um... 
  So you... 
  You for sure have to go back to the city tonight? 
  Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  I'm gonna be there Wednesday. 
  Do you want to hang out? 
  Well... 
  Yes.

  I do.
