That's it.  Yeah.      Okay.  So, I...      - But didn't you write them a check?  - Did they get the check?      - Don't they have the check?  - No, they wrote the check and...      and I asked them to write it in the back.      So they wrote themselves a check.      - Yeah.  - They wrote it in the back.  Okay.      "A and K Plumbing, $   ." Right there.      - Is that it?  - Yeah.  That's it.      - Yeah.  - Just because they wrote     "   " right here,     doesn't mean the check was written for    .      It could be more.      Oh no, they were very nice guys.      It's fine.      - Okay.  - Listen, how about some lunch?      I gotta get going.  It's...  it's...  I gotta go.      Well, if you gotta go, all right, you must.      Hold on.  I'm just gonna do this real quick.      ART: You know, it, uh...      f*ck.  That's a lot of ice cream.      I'm just gonna put this away,     - and then...  - Yeah, sure.  Thanks.      You're a wonderful guy.      - You're a very nice guy.  - Hey, I just do what I can.      Even when you were small.      (CHATTERING ON TV)      - Okay.  - Even when you were small,     you were a nice guy.      What can I say?      Like your mother.      - (SIGHS)  - She always said you were her favorite.      I shouldn't say that out loud, but it's true.      She said that all the time.  Don't tell Sofia.      (SIGHS)      Well, Sofia's kind of a pain in the ass,     so how could she be the favorite, right?      (LAUGHS)  You're such a rascal.      - Funny guy.  - Yeah, man.      My funny guy!  Oh, that face.      Don't cover up that handsome face.      Please.      - Okay.  - All right?      - All right.  I'll see you later, man.  - All right.      Bye-bye.      - (DOOR OPENS)  - I'm so proud of you, son.      I appreciate that.  Thank you.      - I'll see you.  - Take it easy, man.
