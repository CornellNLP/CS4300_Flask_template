    -  Pardon moi. 
  - No problem. 
    [continues speaking French] 
    Okay. 
  Hey, hey, we should take Claire on that tour. 
    She's probably already gone. 
  She lives in the neighborhood. 
     I might want to go, Ron. 
     You're a grown-ass woman. 
  You do what you want. 
     Come on. 
  Let's find this damn place. 
  Thank you so much. 
     If we had parked closer... 
     Wait. 
  This left or that left? 
     - Let's go this way. 
  - Okay. 
  All right. 
     You've got to be kidding me. 
  Which one is the... 
  Here, let me see. 
     Oh, this is... 
  So it's the red tape on the back of the... 
     Aha. 
     Hey. 
  Do you think that we should get Claire some mace? 
     Yeah, maybe. 
  I don't like that there's bars on the windows. 
     Do you know what doesn't have bars on the windows? 
     - A hotel. 
  - All right. 
  That'll be enough of that. 
     [laughs] 
  Oh. 
  Hello. 
     Hey. 
  Afternoon. 
     - Hello. 
  - Cute kitty. 
     A cat on a leash? 
  That's freaky, right? 
     - All right, there we go. 
  - Oh good. 
     The whole building, K and upward. 
     It's crazy. 
     Oh God. 
  What a dump. 
     Well, high ceilings, plenty of light. 
     [door thuds] 
  Okay, that's insane. 
     The bathroom door doesn't even open all the way. 
     Yeah, well, you know, it adds character. 
     Eww. 
  Eww. 
  Oh! 
  Ron! 
     The gentlemen left me some dishes in the sink. 
     It's just like home! 
     Man, I got to get these compression socks off. 
     Honey, no! 
  You don't know who has sat on that thing. 
     And don't put your bare feet on that filthy carpet. 
  [Ron groans] 
     [sighs] 
     [grunts] 
  Wait. 
     [sighs] 
  Where's the bedroom? 
     I think it's up there. 
     Up this ladder? 
     - Uh-huh. 
  - No, no. 
  No. 
  No. 
     There is never a Sleep Number at the top of a ladder. 
     It'd be like sleeping in a tree house. 
     Oh, please, Aunt Sue. 
  Let's see how whimsical you're feeling the fourth time you get up to pee tonight. 
     Hey, settle down. 
     Claire thinks she's doing us a good thing. 
     It's cheaper than a hotel, and besides, we... 
     - Oh, oh, hell no. 
  - What? 
     - Hell no! 
  - What is it? 
     There's a f*cking snake over there! 
     Oh my... 
  [laughing] 
     Yes, Ron. 
  It's just like a tree house, with a snake and everything. 
     It's like  The Jungle Book. 
     Is it in the ad? 
  Did they have it in the ad? 
     I don't know. 
  I never saw the ad. 
     You are the one, Ron, who was okay with Claire picking us a place. 
     - A f*cking snake in a box. 
  - Hey. 
     Do you know where there are no snakes? 
     Shut up! 
  [laughs] 
     Yup, we got in okay. 
     Found parking a few blocks away. 
  It was a little bit of a walk. 
     Oh, honey, is this neighborhood safe for the car? 
     Well, I know, but you never know. 
     No. 
  Yes. 
  The place... 
     [whispers] 
  No. 
  That hotel is too expensive. 
  It is. 
     No, honey, the place is fine. 
     Thank you so much for setting it up. 
     Yup. 
  Oh no, we are in a loft. 
     There's a snake. 
  It is all happening. 
     Wait. 
  What? 
  Oh. 
  Umm... 
  [clears throat] 
     - Claire didn't know there was a snake. 
  - Oh, it's in the ad. 
     The snake's name is Fagin. 
     - She didn't even read it. 
  - Fagin? 
     Okay, honey, your dad is freaked out, needless to say. 
     I am so glad you like it. 
  I was so stressing out about it. 
     Oh, honey, it's wonderful. 
     Daddy and I are going to be very hip, staying here this weekend. 
  [laughs] 
  [grumbles] 
     Oh, if anyone in the building asks... 
     - Yeah? 
  - Don't say you're doing Airbnb. 
     - How come? 
  - Well, it's illegal, but not illegal, but really is illegal. 
  You know what? 
  Don't even... 
  Don't even bother. 
     Okay. 
  Did you hear that, Ron? 
  We're outlaws. 
     - Hey. 
  - Hey, Claire.

      Well, if we can get a table.

  what the girl has to say. 
      So, what are you up to?

  Ooh. 
      You don't have to whisper.

  Yeah, so not the white woman leading the conversation. 
      Probably for the best. 
      All this stuff has been happening while I've been gone? 
      We've been having a lot of fun, but we've missed you so much. 
      Every week we talk a lot. 
  People are energized. 
      But you know what? 
  The first march was, "Ah!" I mean, I stayed... 
  Actually, the first march was super safe. 
      - It wasn't that crazy. 
  - It was a lot of anger... 
      It actually wasn't very violent, which is not a positive thing. 
      What are you talking about? 
  That's a great thing. 
      Everyone was like, "Oh, it was so peaceful. 
  Good job, protesters." The police decide whether they escalate something or not, so I'm not interested in praising the police for not beating the hell out of people. 
      In Ferguson, the police react very differently to the protesters, and that's because of racism. 
      And the fact is that we should not be praising the police for showing restraint against white people. 
      I'm saying that you can have a good time and you can protest at the same time. 
      They wouldn't move. 
  They wouldn't act. 
      Beating the hell out of a peaceful protester...

  No, no, no. 
  Wait.

  Okay. 
      Here's my thought. 
  Here's my thought. 
  Come on. 
      sh1t is going down, ladies, and if I'm going to the gun fight, I don't wanna show up armed with my amazing ideals. 
      I wanna show up with an actual gun. 
      What... 
  No. 
  What do you think is going to happen when you come with a gun? 
      People use guns. 
  No, no, I knew you wouldn't like it, but the point is, things are changing. 
      We didn't think this stuff was going to happen, and it happened. 
  The rules have changed. 
      You're gonna shoot yourself in the leg is what's gonna happen. 
      I'm not gonna shoot myself. 
  Or someone else. 
      Once you bring a gun out, more guns come out. 
      - Yes, exactly. 
  - That's correct. 
      Do you know how to use it? 
      I don't... 
  I mean, how hard could it be? 
      I have a master's. 
  I'm sure I can figure out how to... 
      - In literature though, right? 
  - Yeah. 
      Are you kidding? 
  That's great. 
      You think you can show up to a "gun fight"? 
      What do you mean? 
  Against the police? 
  Against who?

      - Yes, don't worry. 
  - I brought food. 
      Great. 
  And I got Malia a little gift for being her. 
      - You're too sweet. 
  - Thank you. 
      Well, I was hoping to give it to her myself. 
      - Okay. 
  I'm sure that can happen. 
  - Maybe later. 
      I'm gonna go join the party. 
  Sure. 
      - Molly, Molly, Molly. 
  - Hi, Camille. 
      How are you? 
      Camille got Malia a black doll. 
      Is that weird? 
  I mean, Malia is half black, and she should have an abundance of black dolls of all different types, which she does. 
  Yeah, but do you think she's trying to tell us something? 
      Like when she babysat, did she take count of how many black dolls and how many white dolls she had or something? 
      I put together this little number. 
      - Ahh! 
  - Vulva! 
      - It's plush. 
  Whoa! 
  - It's so detailed. 
      It has multiple... 
  vulvas. 
  Oh my God. 
  Wow. 
      - Where's the v*g1n*? 
  - This is vulva. 
      You got... 
  You're all vulva right now. 
      There is artistic license. 
  I imagined     your v*g1n*, Rachel, when I made it. 
  Yeah. 
      Because, obviously, look at the coloring. 
      You know what it is? 
  It's tighter that I would think. 
      Cecily's the only woman of color here. 
      Do you think she feels okay with that? 
      Well, I know that we strive towards inclusion and representation always, but it's okay. 
      I'm trying to build a safe space, and I was actually really excited for Malia, to spend some time with some women of color. 
      Of course. 
  Of course. 
  And we can make sure that that happens. 
      If it doesn't happen today, that's only one time. 
      Who are you texting? 
      I'm just inviting a few more people since we had some cancellations. 
      Don't be weird. 
  I am not being weird. 
      Your coat drive went really well, though. 
      Thank you. 
  It was a huge success. 
  That was great. 
      Ooh, I should've given you some coats. 
      Yeah, you should've. 
  Sorry. 
 
 
 
      It's okay. 
  We did really, really well. 
  Yeah. 
      [whispers] 
  I kept one coat. 
  No, you didn't. 
      Where that weed at, girl? 
  I know. 
  Actually, we're out, but I was gonna order in. 
  You want? 
  Yes, I want. 
      Let's do it. 
  Of course I want. 
      You know what? 
  A hot glue gun. 
      Yes. 
  Okay, well, plug it in. 
      Katy Perry is actually Jon Benet Ramsey. 
      No. 
  I saw... 
  yes. 
  Have you read that? 
      And I did see this. 
  Why are you so... 
      Why do you immediately negate me? 
      I know, but I just feel like... 
      [knock on door] 
  Has anybody even looked at the years they were born? 
  It's the eyes. 
      Hi! 
  Dawnesha! 
      Hi. 
  It is so good to see you. 
      Her parents sacrificed her for Katy Perry's success. 
      - Hey, everyone. 
  - I'm telling you. 
      This is Dawnesha. 
      Hi. 
  Oh, Hi. 
  This is my wife, Molly. 
      Hi. 
  Oh wait, you guys have met. 
      You came to her amazing restorative yoga class at Kula. 
      That's right. 
  Yes. 
  Well, I haven't seen this one in my amazing class in a while. 
      Listen, I've been busy organizing these meet-ups, and I'm glad you could come. 
      Make a sign. 
  You want a red wine? 
  Yes, please. 
      [intercom rings] 
      This is, like, beautiful. 
  Just do this. 
      Dude, your weed guy's so fast. 
      He hasn't even texted me back yet. 
      Brenna, who's here? 
  Who did you invite? 
      I just invited a few more people. 
  Don't worry about it. 
      We've got room. 
  [women chattering] 
      - How do you know Brenna? 
  - Oh, I actually don't. 
  We've never met. 
      We just follow each other on Instagram. 
      She sent me a message. 
  She told me to come over. 
      It was a mild winter. 
  I know. 
  Remember that day, in February? 
         degrees in February. 
      You know, there are some good things about global warming. 
      It was really nice. 
  I mean, it's scary. 
  Just saying, you know? 
      Hey, you doing all right? 
  You got wine? 
  Hey, girl. 
  Yeah. 
      Okay, so this isn't a deck that I've ever really used. 
      Ooh, whatever. 
  Tarot's tarot, no? 
      In terms of delineation of tasks, it is like a "Pump Up the Jams" playlist. 
      Of course, yeah. 
  I already started it. 
  Oh. 
  Okay, great. 
      [intercom rings] 
  Molly, I think Cary's early! 
      Oh, it's the weed guy. 
  Wait. 
  Weed guy? 
      I thought we had a policy. 
      I'm not okay with this. 
      It's not like he's coming in to hang out with us. 
      Well, do you think he'll mind if you buy weed in the hall? 
      Just for today? 
  The hallway? 
  I'm not buying weed in the hallway. 
      What if somebody walks by? 
  [scoffs] 
  I don't know! 
      Molly, he just has a really intense male look. 
      He might trigger someone. 
      I always use a service that's all women. 
      Really? 
  It's female owned, female operated. 
      - Amazing. 
  - It's called CannaBitches. 
      CannaBitches? 
  That's wonderful. 
      [knocks on door] 
  It's gonna be fine. 
      Hey, hey. 
  What's up? 
  Hey. 
      Nice to see you. 
  Hey, Brenna. 
  Nice to see you too. 
      Hi. 
  How are ya? 
  Oh, a party. 
  Can I take these off? 
      Yes, thank you very much. 
  Sure. 
      Someone lost their cat. 
  Nice to see you. 
      Nice to see you too. 
  [Whispers] 
  All right, so listen. 
      I want to let you know that there's a palpable feminine moon energy surging through the space right now... 
  Okay. 
      And just you even being a man could disrupt it, so just try to be neutral, okay? 
      Oh man. 
  Should I go? 
  No, no, no, no, no. 
  Come on in. 
      But just... 
  [exhales slowly] 
      Okay. 
      [whispers] 
  It's fine. 
  Are you sure? 
      Yeah. 
  Okay. 
      Hey, you wanna set up over here? 
  Uh, sure. 
      Sure. 
  Yeah. 
  Sorry. 
      Don't mean to take up too much space. 
      Totally fine. 
  We got room. 
  Oh yeah. 
      Hold on a second. 
  This idea of male allies just reinforces that we need their voice to speak for us, that they validate our existence and what we want. 
      - And, uh... 
  - Well, how's the Amnesia Haze? 
      Uh, you know, it's good, man... 
  ma'am. 
  It's good. 
      It's really good. 
  Uh... 
      It's perpetuating the idea that we need them to help us to fix... 
  Right, right, and if they wanna help us, they have to stop treating us like we're helpers. 
      Well, I guess we'll take Amnesia Haze. 
  Thanks. 
      I don't have any money. 
  Brenna, you got cash? 
      - Create machines to jack 'em off. 
  - There is more - than our lives to procreating. 
  - Okay. 
      But not... 
  we don't all have to procreate. 
      - No, we don't. 
  - But some of us do. 
      Some want to. 
  Yeah. 
      You sure you don't want any more? 
      I think we're all right. 
  All right. 
      Oh, hey, will you take a picture of us before you go? 
      White people and black people had to come together for us to end slavery and Jim Crow. 
      I don't know why I'm gesticulating towards... 
  End Jim Crow? 
      Cool. 
      Guys! 
  Picture, picture, picture! 
      - Quick, quick, quick! 
  - All right. 
      All right. 
  You got this. 
      I want the pussy-teeth sign. 
      [lively chattering] 
      Oh good, get that in the shot. 
  We got it. 
  We got it. 
      We ready? 
  Okay. 
      - Horizontal? 
  - Yeah, horizontal. 
      Horizontal? 
  Yeah. 
      All right. 
  Okay, here we go. 
      And... 
  hey, there's something... 
      What? 
  [screaming, shouting] 
      Oh sh1t! 
  Oh! 
      Shut up! 
  Everybody calm down! 
      Calm down! 
  Calm down. 
      Calm down! 
  You gotta get under it like a pizza. 
      You gotta get under it like a pizza. 
      Yes. 
  Don't hurt it. 
      No, you gotta sandwich it. 
  I am giving him a platform. 
      We all deserve a platform. 
  Be careful. 
      We all deserve this. 
  Holy sh1t. 
      - Don't hurt it. 
  - I'm not hurting it. 
      It-it... 
  it's soft. 
  Come on, snake. 
  Come on, little snake. 
      Everybody, get down! 
      [screaming, shouting] 
      Rachel, you brought a gun in our f*cking house? 
      You guys, I am... 
  I am handling this. 
      Rachel, don't you dare shoot that f*cking snake in my house! 
      Okay, okay, okay. 
  It's moving. 
  I'm all good. 
  [knocking on door] 
      Okay, somebody's at the door. 
      [women shouting] 
  I got it. 
  I got it. 
      Rachel, my baby is outside the f*cking door. 
      I'm not shooting Malia. 
  I'm shooting the snake! 
      - Rachel! 
  - Guys, I'm freaking out! 
  Be quiet! 
      - Mommy. 
  - Hi, baby. 
      - Hi. 
  Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi. 
      Hi. 
  So, we've got a bit of a situation. 
      It's totally fine. 
  It's an adult situation. 
      Could you just go upstairs, minutes... 
  Do you want me to help you? 
      - Put the gun down, Rachel. 
  - Uh, no. 
      Absolutely not. 
  Thank you. 
  We've got it super under control. 
      Down! 
  Put the gun down! 
      [women yelling] 
  Please stop yelling at me. 
      Repeat, "I am not insane," and put the gun down. 
      Okay, okay, I'm sorry! 
  Stop yelling! 
  I'm sorry. 
      [The Guy groans] 
  Okay, okay, should I drop it? 
      sh1t. 
  Don't drop the gun. 
  Just put it down. 
      On the table. 
  Okay, putting it... 
  I'm moving the cheese. 
      I'm moving the cheese. 
  I'm putting it down. 
  I'm putting it down. 
      I'm so sorry. 
  I'm sorry, you guys. 
  I love you. 
      It's just... 
  he seems nice. 
      You brought a gun into this house? 
      All right! 
  Sisters, listen! 
      We gotta get this f*cking snake out of the apartment. 
      Who is with me? 
      - I am with you. 
  Are you kidding me? 
  - We're with you. 
      I am supporting you from here! 
      Wait a sec. 
  I think I know that snake. 
      What? 
  I've... 
  I mean, I don't know the snake. 
      I delivered down the hall to somebody. 
      I saw the snake. 
  His name is Fagin. 
      Or her name is Fagin. 
  I don't know. 
      It's a neighbor's snake. 
  Fagin. 
  Fagin. 
      [indistinct chatter] 
  No, no, no, no. 
  Don't. 
  Don't. 
      I just don't think that you should... 
  You know what? 
      Everyone shut the f*ck up for a second. 
      You should pick it up by both ends to support it. 
      I'm supporting it. 
  You need the butt too. 
      Pick it up the right way. 
  Don't... 
      [excited chattering] 
      All right, move! 
  Move! 
      Move. 
  Move. 
  Move. 
      Move. 
  Move! 
      Oh... 
  sh1t. 
  It's down the hall. 
      Okay, all right, just don't... 
      Careful. 
  Careful. 
  All right. 
      That's not the one. 
  That's not... 
  That's not the one. 
      Hey! 
      Are you guys in that snake club? 
      Snake club? 
      What's that? 
  I don't know what that is. 
  What does that mean? 
      What are you talking about? 
  We don't know what that is. 
      Sorry. 
  I'm looking for a cat. 
      Just keep going. 
  [indistinct chatter] 
      Be careful! 
  We'll let you know if we see the cat. 
  Sorry. 
      Hey, guys, it's  K. 
      Sorry I called you "guys." Sorry I said "guys."     ♪ ♪
