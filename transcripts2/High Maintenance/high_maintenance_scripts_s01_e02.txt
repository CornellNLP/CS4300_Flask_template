 Girl : Here is it. 
 (groaning) 
 Oh! That is disgusting! 
 That is some ratchet sh1t. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That looks like a gnarled root. 
 (laughter) 
 You have to rethink premed if you can't handle looking at an erect pen1s! 
 Erect? What kind of doctor are you trying to be? 
 Let me see. 
 Oh, that is so gross. Why? Why would anybody wanna look at that? 
 No! That's what he sent her after she broke up with him. 
 She broke up with him? 
 That's aggro. 
 She broke up with him? 
 Yeah. 
 She was gonna get weed for me from him. 
 Oh, that is not gonna happen anymore. 
 How do you even study stoned? 
 I don't know. I'm a genius? 
 Oh, she's a genius. 
 That's what we were missing. 
 It doesn't mess anything up, so just let me... 
 You do you, girl. 
 You live your life. 
 I need to pick up my cousin from her youth group thing, so I gotta go. 
 I gotta go too. I'll walk with you. 
 Okay, sounds good. Bye, girl. 
 All : Bye! 
 Why does Chantal have that picture? 
 I was wondering the same thing. She's keeping that dick pic. 
 Here. 
 It's okay, I guess. 
 You don't know anything. 
 Go pick whatever you want, okay? 
 And get me a drink, yeah? 
 Yeah! 
 You can choose. 
 Um, can I have a pack of those guys over there? 
 Can I see your ID? 
 Yeah. 
 You need to be 21 to buy cigarettes. 
 Really? Oh, well, I'm from Texas. 
 You only have to be 18 there, so... 
 Can you make an exception for me just this once, please? 
 You don't look that tall. 
 I am that tall. 
 But you don't look that! 
 The half is very important. 
 I am five-three and a half. 
 Well, well, you may be five-three, but... 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Baba! 
 Hey. 
 I have a lot of work, though. My biology professor hates us. 
 You can handle it. 
 How were your classes? 
 Same as always. It looks like my students hate me. 
 I got a 98 on my Mandarin. 
 Very good. Very good. 
 (mother speaking on phone) 
 Eesha : I'm sorry. I got busy earlier, and then I had to pick up Nasim from the masjid, so I'm sorry. 
 Yeah, we're walking up the stairs with him right now. 
 Faruq khaloo says hi. 
 There's this fish lab I need a little bit of help on. 
 I'll help you with the fish lab. 
 Sorry. 
 What's that smell, baba? 
 That smell? _ Okay? 
 Every time you get that smell, you walk the other way. 
 Well, I smell it in the hallway all the time. 
 So good, now you know... 
 (mother speaks on phone) 
 Sorry. 
 Just pass it over. 
 Beta, you can remove the head thing. We're home. 
 I like it, though. 
 We talked, like, God, twice already today. 
 She really needs something better to do with her time. 
 It's a matter of adjustment. 
 I'm sure we'll be the same when Nasim goes to college. 
 Maybe I can go to Texas A&M and live with Khaloo and Khala? 
 Oh, they'd actually love that. You'd be their dream daughter, Nasim. 
 Harvard. 
 Oh, so does that mean you're gonna actually let her live in the dorms? 
 This is all a little bit too far off, huh? 
 Let's just enjoy the tacos. 
 Can we have pasanday gosht? Like naanni's?

 Ah! There you go. 
 Thank you. 
 No problem. Have a good one.

 Yeah, that's my aunt. 
 Okay. 
 Um, sorry. No, I can't. 
 Come on, dude! What's the deal? I have money. 
 I don't sell to kids, man. 
 I'm not a kid. I'm in college. 
 Well, get weed at college then. 
 I can't. 
 It's complicated. I lost my connect. 
 I get it, but I have this system where people give me a referral of other people, and that's how you get weed from me. 
 So I'm sorry, I can't help you today. 
 I can't go bending the rules.

 Man :  So the ultrasound showed no signs of cancer,  but you did test positive for chlamydia, so that's likely what's causing your discomfort. 
 Now, on the plus side, chlamydia is very treatable. 
 I'm gonna write you a prescription for doxycycline. 
 You're going to need to refrain from s*x for at least one week until both you and your partner are treated, all right? 
 Yeah. 
 God! Nobody's answering their phone or their emails this week. 
 I'm still waiting for a response from guess who? 
 Hmm? 
 Miwa. 
 Ugh, Miwa. 
 Well, you know, maybe she took off for the long weekend and got into a robbery at the convenience store. 
 911? This is Miwa. I'm at the Wawa. 
 (laughs) How do you know about Wawa? 
 The Wawa? There's a Wawa near where, uh, Becky's parents have their lake house. 
 Okay. Okay. Yes. 
 Wawa. 
 I've been working on that Miwa-Wawa gag for ages. 
 Didn't think that would get a laugh. 
 (chuckles) 
 A bit of niche, regional humor. Are you not entertained? 
 I am very entertained by you. 
 Oh, if you guys don't have any plans this weekend, you should come by Leo's birthday party Saturday. 
 Oh! That'd be great. 
 Yeah? Uh, no pressure. 
 Yeah. Is it a late one? Should we get us a sitter? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Definitely get a sitter. 
 Um, well, let me check in with the boss. 
 See if she's made any plans that I don't know about. 
 It's a Moroccan theme. So, if you want, you can dress in that, you know, style. 
 Oh, hello! You could have opened with that. I'm all over that. 
 (phone rings) 
 A-ha, speak of the devil. 
 Hi, honey. 
 Hey, are you with, uh, Colon right now? 
 It's Colin. 
 Leo : Well, there's only one L. 
 Okay. Yeah, you're good at spelling. 
 Can you ask him if the weed guy that we all use also has E? 
 Yeah. Oh, hey. Um, he wants to know, do you if the, uh, weed guy sells E? 
 I... hmm... I think he's just a weed guy. 
 Oh, he thinks he's just a weed guy. 
 Oh, no, man. I haven't sold E since college, but, uh, I sell mushrooms. They're fun. 
 I'm doing them tomorrow for my birthday actually. 
 Uh, I don't think we're really a 'shrooms crowd. 
 Oh, did you hear that? It's his birthday too. 
 A couple of Scorpios. 
 Oh, really? 
 What year? Whoa. 
 Uh, '84. 
 (gasps) Holy sh1t! You're a baby. 
 Oh, no. I don't think so. 
 This is really quite the beard. 
 Can I grab it? 
 Uh... Uh, well, yeah. Go for it. 
 (gasps) It feels like pubic hair. 
 Y... yeah, I guess it does. Thanks. 
 Is that weird? 
 No, it's not weird. 
 I was actually thinking, yeah, that is what my pubic hair feels like, so... 
 Was that weird? I just ate a pot cookie about an hour ago, so I think it's kicking in, if I can be honest. 
 My... Weed nuts. Thoughts? 
 Um, you know, I actually don't do a lot of cooking, but the main rule with edibles is just don't eat too much. 
 Hey, if you get off work early tomorrow and you don't have any plans, you should come by and celebrate your birthday with us. 
 Oh, that's very nice. Thank you. Yeah, maybe... 
 Yeah. Bring your wife. 
 Oh, yeah. Um, yeah. 
 Maybe I will. I work till, like, 11:30 usually, so... 
 That's okay. We go late. 
 Okay. 
 Well, then have a good time. Maybe I'll see you. 
 Don't eat too many nuts. 
 Got it. 
 Happy birthday. Later, guys! Thanks for the invite. 
 Same to you. 
 
 
 
 (grinder whirring) 
 What the f*ck, Gi? Why did you do that? 
 What? 
 He doesn't want to hang with us on his birthday. 
 Oh, you don't know that. 
 Well, you have to think about everybody else. 
 They don't know him. He... We don't know him. 
 Nobody knows Colin and Becky. They're coming. 
 What? Why the f*ck... 
 (scoffs, sighs) 
 ...did you invite them to my birthday? 
 Oh, God, Leo. 
 Leo, Colin is actually my friend. 
 I know that, and I am cool with that, but I just think you should ask me... 
 What the f*ck is your problem? 
 (sighs, mutters) 
 Gigi : Jesus Christ. Then change. 
 I mean, don't dress up. Dress up. Wear normal clothes. 
 Who the f*ck cares, Leo? 
 I'm not going to be some contrary asshole in street wear just because it's my birthday. 
 Street wear? 
 You think you're not an asshole when it's not your birthday? 
 Nice double negative. 
 Yeah, nice shitty attitude. 
 Don't you do this! This is so f*cked right now! 
 (sighs) 
 f*ck it. I... Goddamn it. I'm gonna cancel. 
 I'm gonna email everybody, and I'm gonna tell them it's over, that we're sick. I wouldn't be wrong, would I? 
 Yeah. Oh, now you want to tell people we've got the clap? 
 The clap is gonorrhea. Get your sh1t straight. 
 Well, I'm glad I spent $150 on this f*cking cake then, in addition to everything else you see laid before you. 
 I didn't ask you to do anything. 
 Would it kill you to notice my throw pillows? 
 Excuse me for living halfway to a hundred. 
 Oh, okay. 
 You know what? 
 (doorbell buzzes) 
 Who... Fifteen minutes early to a party? 
 Who f*cking does this? I hate this. 
 Hello? 
 Colin (on intercom) : Hey! It's Colin and Becky! 
 Sorry we're a bit early. 
 Oh, that's okay! Come on up! 
 I'm changing into pants! 
 Man : No, I'm telling you, if you had told me ten years ago that a one bedroom shithole in Greenpoint would go for two million dollars, I would have, you know, I would have bought a couple of one bedroom shitholes in Greenpoint, you know? 
 You were smart to buy what you did when you did. 
 Can we stop talking about real estate? 
 It is seriously so boring. 
 I know no one wants to talk about it, but he's on the spectrum, right? 
 Nobody wants to say anything. 
 Okay, right. 
 But why don't they just get him tested? 
 They're afraid of the results. 
 I'm just worried about my daughter. 
 Wish she'd stop wetting the f*cking bed. 
 She's in the fifth f*cking grade. 
 Oh, that's a beautiful tunic. 
 It's a jalaba. 
 Oh! 
 I got it in Morocco last winter. 
 I'm dying to go to Morocco, but every time we get a break, we have to go visit Colin's family. 
 It's great. 
 Mm. 
 They have amazing textiles. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I went nuts buying fabric. 
 Why don't you get Rachel Comey to send you over there? 
 Oh, well, I wish she would, but I think it's more likely she's gonna send me to LA. 
 We're opening a store. 
 Oh, no, no, no. That's not fun. 
 Well, I kind of like LA. I've lived here my whole life, so at some point... 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 You're not taking my Colin way from me. We just got financing! 
 Well, uh... I was just telling her about LA. Just a nascent idea. 
 It's not. Can I, um, top anyone off? 
 I'm good. 
 I love this. 
 Oh, this? Thank you. 
 God. 
 You know where I got this? 
 Where? 
 You know where we were scouting the other day, off Atlantic? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah, I went back there. 
 You didn't go back. 
 Mm-hm. It was awesome. 
 And, uh, then I made the gross mistake of going downstairs and having that Yemenite food that you said looked dodgy. 
 No, you didn't. 
 I had food poisoning for what, like, two days? 
 Two days, yeah. 
 f*ck! I hoped you stiffed them on the tip. 
 In Boulder, we go out to the movies, and then afterwards, we go out to, like, a pot club. 
 You just fill a pint glass with weed smoke, and you do it like a beer. 
 What? 
 Amazing. 
 That's un-fucking-believable.

 Colin : Totally. 
 Gigi : Thank God. At least that.
