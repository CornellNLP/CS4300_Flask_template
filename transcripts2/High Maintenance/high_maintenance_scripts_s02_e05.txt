   But I think you should call a close friend. 
   I don't think you should be alone right now. 
   You look like you could use a hug. 
   [sighs] 
  Okay. 
   Okay. 
  Do you want to... 
   keep your same appointment time for next week? 
   Actually, would it be possible for me to come back first thing on Monday? 
   I'm sorry, I'm all booked up for Monday. 
   Friday is still the only day that I can accommodate a double session. 
   Okay. 
   You're doing great work, Natalie. 
   I'll... 
  see you next week. 
   - Thank you.

  Mmhmm. 
  Big fan. 
   [babbles] 
   Oh, that's... 
  very frightening. 
   Phyllis? 
   - I'm out. 
  Good night. 
  Do not call me. 
  - Bye, baby. 
  Okay. 
   I'm, like, falling off the bed. 
   You're not falling off the bed. 
   Look at me, I'm holding on for dear life. 
   I promise if you let go, you're not gonna fall. 
   I really don't wanna fall. 
   You are not falling. 
   Would you call Sarah for me? 
   I need to talk to her before I die. 
   You're fine. 
  You just ate a little too much pot. 
   My teeth feel brittle. 
   - Your teeth are also fine. 
  - There's nothing wrong with you teeth. 
   I can't breathe. 
  Oh God. 
  I don't wanna die. 
   You just gotta chill. 
   - I don't wanna die. 
  - Just chill. 
   You just gotta chill. 
  That's it. 
  Hey. 
   What was that? 
  Holy sh1t. 
   Huh. 
  Thanks! 
   Yeah, lemme know if you need any more. 
   But I'm gonna give 'em to you. 
   - Hey, you're a pal. 
  - Huh? 
   [man laughs] 
  [heartbeat thumping] 
   But I'm gonna give 'em to you. 
   - You're a pal. 
  - Huh? 
   - Sharesies. 
  - You. 
  I always share. 
   [man laughs] 
  [high-pitched humming] 
   Ahh. 
  Mmm. 
   [child crying] 
  [woman shushing] 
   It's okay. 
  It's okay.
