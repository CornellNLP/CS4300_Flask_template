 [voice mail]: Hi. You've reached Anja, and you're probably my mom, dad or grandma, so just feel free to leave a message and I'll get back to you when I can. 
 Thanks. [beep] 
 Woman [over phone] : Anja, I wish you'd change your outgoing message. 
 It's not very professional. 
 How do you know it's me, Dad, or Noni calling? 
 Anyway, I sent this in an e-mail, [Anja coughs] that the woman you should call is Barbara Horne. 
 H-O-R-N-E. 
 She's been at the top of God knows how many publications and she's the real deal, honey. All right? 
 I told her about your NYU column. 
 She's expecting your call, so call her please. 
 Do not e-mail. But like I said, just see if you can take her to lunch, pick her brain, whatever. 
 She's kind of a pain in the ass, but, you know, she's very major. 
 Uh, anyway, there you go. You're welcome. Um, what else? 
 Uh, not much happening over here. 
 Dad and I walked down to the lake with Rosie this morning. 
 She had a tough time. 
 I think we're gonna have to put her down soon so of course, Daddy's a wreck. 
 But if you want to see her, you should come visit. 
 Ow, ow, ow, Anyway, call us and call Barbara!

 Hey, what's up? 
 Anja : Thanks for agreeing to do this. 
 Yeah, it's not a big deal. 
 I mean, as long as I'm anonymous, I don't really care. 
 Yeah, no, of course. 
 Of course. You will be completely anonymous. 
 Um... uh... do you mind if I take a picture of your weed though? 
 I guess I'd rather you didn't. 
 It's just I have all these, you know, labels and I don't want any identifying things on the Internet, you know what I mean? 
 Uh, yeah. Okay, that's... 
 Sorry. 
 That's fine. Do you want some cold brew? 
 Uh, no. I actually had two today, so I'm good. 
 Oh, wow. 
 This is, like, my sixth cup today.

 Okay, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Cool. 
 That's a lot of coffee.

 Yeah. 
 There we go. 
 There you go. 
 Um, all right. Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 This is a safe space. 
 So... you're a pot dealer. 
 What's that like? 
 Uh, I just kind of bike around and, uh, people call me and... and then I bring them weed pretty much. 
 It's kind of all there is to it. 
 And, uh, where do you get your weed? 
 Uh... I'm not gonna answer that one. Sorry. 
 Pass. 
 Okay. 
 Cool. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's totally cool. Um... 
 Have you ever been arrested? 
 No, luckily not. Knock on wood. 
 Yeah. 
 Right? 
 Yeah. Um... 
 Do you feel like maybe that's because you're white? 
 Uh, maybe. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Um... I... I mean, yeah, I guess it has something to do with it. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 But, you know, it's also maybe 'cause I'm small potatoes and, uh... 
 Yeah. 
 I just deal a little weed and sometimes mushrooms, so I'm not really... 
 Oh. Okay. 
 So mushrooms as well? 
 Yeah, I'm not really on their radar. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 What about your, um, client list? 
 Are they mostly white as well, like you? 
 Well, uh, yeah, most of them are white actually. 
 Now that I think about it. I haven't really thought about it before. 
 There's... There's some... 
 No, there's more than a few non-white customers. 
 Why do you think that most of your clients are white? 
 Hey, so what's with all the racial questions? 
 Well, it's just that a... a disproportionate amount of people in prison for marijuana offenses are... are non-white, and I thought you might have something to say about that. 
 I mean, that's cool. I understand. It's important, but, uh... just, uh, off the record, when I sat down to do this, you said you wanted me to tell you some fun stories about dealing weed, and not, uh... 
 Mm-hmm. race politics. 
 Yeah, I know, I know. 
 So like, just a heads up, you know? 
 I'm sor... It's just that, um... 
 I feel like there's a bigger point that we... you know, like, it's just... 
 I'm trying to focus on, like, the, um, intersectionality of, like, race and pot in a post-prohibition era. 
 And we will get to the anecdotes. Um... 
 I just felt like I would be remiss as an interviewer if I didn't cover this very important part of the subject. 
 Like blacks in Iowa are 8.3% more likely to get arrested for... for possession and dealing than... than bla... than whites. 
 And, and I just... I felt like it was important to highlight how race might affect your experience of your job. 
 It is important. 
 Yeah. 
 [phone rings] 
 I'm sorry. Um, uh... 
 Do you... Would you actually just... uh, excuse me for a second?

 Hello? 
 Whoa, dude. 
 Hi, Barbara! 
 Thanks for calling me back! 
 Oh, my gosh, it's like, so nice that you called back at all! 
 I mean, my mom's been talking about you for a while, and, uh, to be honest, I didn't even really know who you were, who you are. 
 But then I Googled you and I was like, "Wow..." 
 Okay, here we go. 
 "this woman is like f*cking legit!" 
 Right. So I was hoping to find the time to like, buy you coffee and pick your brain. 
 The Guy : Oh, f*ck you. 
 Oh, no. 
 Okay, um... 
 In that case, can I, um, can I call you tomorrow again? 
 I'm actually in the middle of...

 Reporter : Now, using a dating app to find romance may have become the norm for finding love in the modern age, but this next fall comedy might have you think twice before swiping right. 
 It's called "Homeless Helga" and it stars "Orange Is the New Black's" Kimiko Glenn as Helga, who's, you guessed it, homeless. 
 Mm, ain't nobody got time for this. 
 Can we get the lobster mac and cheese, lamb face tacos, and a bottle of Dom? 
 Reporter : Now, on the surface, Helga looks anything but homeless. 
 She's adorable and put together, but she secretly scams guys she meets online into buying her meals and letting her crash. 
 So I met this girl on "What's Up, Cupid." I think I'm falling in love. 
 Her victims are totally oblivious as Helga blinds them with her adorable charm. 
 Almost done, baby. 
 Yay. Let's order tacos, dum-dum. 
 Okay. I'll pay. 
 [gasps] 
 It's working out well for her, but some people are on to Helga and her tricks. 
 I play Matt's weed dealer, and he tells Matt in the pilot that Helga is actually homeless. 
 She's called Homeless Helga, bro. 
 Uh-uh. 
 I would definitely say that Brooklyn is a character in this show without a doubt. 
 Matt : You can stay as long as you want. 
 Helga : Maybe I should just move in. 
 [Helga giggles] 
 Reporter : Be sure to tune in for this hilarious hipster comedy. 
 Yaaas! 
 Reporter : That really does make me think twice about online dating.

 I'm sorry, but do we know each other? 
 Uh... 
 Oh. 
 Well, I'm glad you and your Hollywood friends finally realized I was gonna sue your f*cking face off for getting rich off of my f*cking life story! 
 Yeah, I... I'm sorry, but I... I don't know who you are. 
 Oh, okay. Listen, shithead, pretending that I didn't endure two weeks of your stupid jokes and your stupid f*cking shitty railroad apartment, isn't gonna happen. 
 Look, I can't say that I know what you're talking about, Miss. 
 You see, I recently came into a bit of monetary success, and, well, now all sorts of people are crawling out of the woodwork and it kind of sounds like you're looking for a payday too. 
 Does that sound right or... 
 [screams] 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 Okay, look... 
 I don't need your money! 
 But I will say that if you and I were to spend a whole week in my apartment together, alone, ordering take-out and only going out at night to drink in dark places by ourselves, then I'm sure there'd be no one there to back up your story. 
 Oh. 
 Which never happened.

 You want me to testify in court that I'm a weed dealer and that I saw you scamming one of my clients? 
 Not in court, no.

 No, what do you mean she's homeless, dude? 
 Sin casa,  bro.

 He's kind of that comic relief. And...

 Listen, Ms. Park, are you able to offer physical proof that you ever spent time with Mr. Greene? 
 Yes. We have printouts of all of our correspondences on OkCupid, and I think you will see that Mark and I have had several exchanges since we, uh... before we met up. 
 We also have a printout of my inbox if you'd like to take a look at that... 
 Ms. Park? 
 .. as well. Yes? 
 Ms. Park, do you have proof that you actually, physically, spent time together? 
 My client was, well, let's just say he was rather active in the online dating community at the time you say you were lovers. 
 He was corresponding with a number of women three years ago. 
 Oh. 
 You mean private stuff, like he only has one ball? 
 Stuff like that? 
 Like personal, private information? 
 No, I don't know Heidi Park, nor am I acquainted with her drug dealer. 
 There are a number of details in your screenplay that would tell us otherwise, Mr. Greene. 
 It's incredible how many people think my work is about them. 
 It's been very surprising, but I think that just, you know, speaks to the universality of my writing. 
 I am surprised. 
 The specificity of the details of your "Homeless Helga" series, the Germanic first name that starts with an H, the family-owned yogurt business, these details, sir, are... fabricated from your own imagination?
