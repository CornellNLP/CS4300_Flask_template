 Can you hold the door... 
 Sorry. [grunts] Sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, can you press four, please? 
 Thank you. 
 You ever see "What About Bob"? 
 [phone chirps] 
 Hey, Patrick, man. 
 Hello? 
 I'm in an elevator. 
 Okay... 
 You're cutting out. 
 What? 
 Sorry... you back... 
 Okay. Great. That would be great. 
 Bye. 
 Like... like we were in a dream of something, right? 
 [coughs] 
 Bless you. 
 [elevator dings] 
 [door opens] 
 [buzzer] 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 This is f*cking cool. 
 I made it. Very good. 
 How are you, man... oh, I'm sorry. 
 Does that, uh... mean I should be quieter? 
 No, no. She's, um... she's not with us anymore, so... 
 I'm so sorry, man. 
 It's fine. 
 It's been... it was a long time coming. It's been like six months, so... 
 I'm getting used to it, so... 
 Good. 
 Um, are you thirsty? Do you want water? 
 Uh, yeah, that'd be great. 
 Something tells me you're gonna offer me a LaCroix. 
 Yup. Um... do you mind drinking a coconut one though? Because I need white. 
 Uh, no. Does it taste good? 
 Yeah... yeah. 
 All right. Cool. 
 Do you want a lemon square? 
 Uh, maybe on my way out. Sure. 
 And, um... do you have time today to just, um... like, stay and smoke with me a little bit? 
 Uh... yeah, sure. You got a bowl? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Cool. 
 Is this one good? 
 Uh, that's not what I had in mind, but, um, why don't you just pick something? 
 We'll figure it out. 
 So the idea is to just let the gravity do the work... 
 Right and when I take out the Greebs, Mm-hmm. 
 You push down and inhale at the same time. 
 It's gonna be pretty nasty, so be careful. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, oh. 
 Oh, my god. 
 You're losing it. 
 [coughs] 
 Oh! Oh, sh1t. 
 [coughs] 
 Oh, f*ck. Very smooth. 
 [chuckles] 
 Oh, I don't think so. 
 You want something to drink? 
 Yeah. Uh, yeah. Coconut. 
 Oh yeah, the white. 
 I need the white. 
 The whites! 
 [chuckles] 
 [groans] 
 That was good. 
 Sorry, man. It's... it's pretty rough. 
 You know, I usually have vape pens, but I ran out. 
 That's okay. I don't... 
 We didn't really, um... smoke it anyway because, um... like, I would bake with it 'cause my mom's lungs were bad. 
 [opens LaCroix] 
 Baked with only an eighth at a time? 
 No, I baked a dozen. 
 Okay. Cool. 
 This is new. This is nice. 
 Yeah, I got that one on Etsy. 
 Yeah. 
 But she looks sad. 
 Her eyes are all, like, little sad eyes. 
 I like that one. 
 It's from this movie, "Ride." She wrote it, she directed it, she stars in it, and it's, like, about, um... an overbearing mother and her son moves away, and... and she plays... 
 She doesn't "play." [laughing] She... she learns how to surf. 
 She learns to do... [laughing] 
 She teaches herself how to surf. 
 And there's this part... 
 [laughs] she smokes a joint in it. 
 Oh. 
 And she just, like, laughs and then she cries. 
 She's good when she cries, I think. I don't know. 
 [both chuckle] 
 You pretty f*cked up? 
 No. Maybe. 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah. 
 So I have to ask you a question. 
 Yeah? 
 [belches] 
 [laughing] How long have we been s... sitting here? 
 Like, uh, not very long. 
 I feel like... 
 [whispers] a little bit like I'm in a movie. 
 Oh, yeah, man. That's, like, the best part. 
 Sometimes you just put on headphones and you're walking around the city. 
 It's like you're in a movie. It's awesome. 
 That sounds fun. 
 Yeah, it is fun. 
 You should do it sometime. 
 I bet it's fun if you like... if you, like, listen to a real movie soundtrack and then it's like you're in that movie or your own movie or whatever. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna go, man. 
 No. Okay. 
 It's really nice outside, so you should, uh... have your movie moment today. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 I'm not even gonna put on my jacket. 
 Don't. 
 Don't put on your jacket. 
 Take off your shirt. 
 [laughs] Just... I'm kidding. 
 Gotcha, man. 
 All right, well... 
 Take a bar. Take a bar. 
 Okay. 
 [laughs] 
 See you later, man. 
 Take two. 
 No, this is good. 
 I appreciate it. Thank you. 
 [laughing] 
 I hope you feel better, man. 
 I feel great. 
 [door closes] 
 Oh, my god, what's happening? 
 Hey, Mom. 
 [laughs] 
 Mm... 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 [sniffing] 
 Okay... 
 Oh, hey, Patrick. 
 Hey, Carl. 
 What, are you going out? 
 Yup. I'm just going for a walk. 
 I heard it was nice out. 
 Well, you... you enjoy yourself. 
 I will. Thanks. 
 You... tell me how it is, all right? 
 Okay, Carl. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, you're back. 
 Yeah, I forgot something. 
 Well, you go right ahead. 
 No, no, you... you go. It's cool. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 [chuckles] I hope you're not in any hurry or anything. 
 I'm getting my workout. 
 That wears me out.

 I told you to get the f*ck out of here! 
 Holy sh1t. 
 There's Passionfruit. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, no. 
 sh1t. 
 You're not... you're not okay. You're bleeding. 
 Come use my bathroom. 
 We'll leave this. I'll come back for it. 
 Oh, you're a psychic? 
 Oh yeah. 
 I saw that comin'. 
 What's your name? 
 Pam. 
 Let me see your hand. 
 Ouch, ouch. 
 I hope you don't mind, I had to put your cart out on the curb. 
 It's busted. 
 I'm pretty embarrassed that you saw me do that. 
 [scoffs] Those old lady carts are treacherous. 
 You're lucky you made it out alive. 
 Let's see that forehead. 
 I hope you don't mind me saying so, Patrick, but... your scalp's pretty dry. 
 You should try some argan oil.

 Did I hurt you? 
 No, no, I just...

 Oh. 
 [crying continues] 
 [sniffles] 
 I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. 
 It's okay, hon. 
 I'd offer to give you a palm reading, but your hands are pretty jacked.

 Give me your leg. 
 Is that that "Toss away what doesn't spark joy" book? 
 Ooh, yes. 
 You should take it. 
 No, I can't take your book. 
 No, I insist.

 The Guy : Excellent.  Pamplemousse.  This is my favorite, I think. 
 I like Cucumber-Grape. That's hard to beat for me, but... 
 Holy sh1t, man. This is... f*cking different. 
 Yeah. 
 Whoa. 
 Um... 
 You... oh, you don't have to do that today. 
 Uh, I'm not buying. 
 Huh? 
 So I've... I've been simplifying some things in my life... 
 Yeah, that's great, man. 
 Thank you. 
 And, um... 
 I mean, that means that I'm not gonna buy weed from you anymore. 
 Or anyone anymore. 
 Okay. 
 I mean, you didn't need to... bring me here to tell me that, but I understand I think. 
 No, I... well, actually, I have something for you, so... 
 [clears throat] 
 If you turn around with a gun and shoot me, I'm gonna... 
 I'm gonna freak out, man. 
 [chuckles] 
 No. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Um... 
 I don't do refunds, you know that, right? 
 I know. I just thought maybe you could use it. [clears throat] 
 Well, some of this weed is... pretty f*cking old. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Some of it. 
 Uh, thanks, man. 
 No problem I wish I had your Tupperwares. 
 I would have brought them back if I knew you were gonna break up with me today. 
 I don't need them. 
 Well, that's good, 'cause I lost most of the lids to them already. 
 That hallway is crazy, man. 
 [Patrick chuckles] 
 Hi again. 
 Right here? 
 Yeah, that's great. 
 Cool. 
 Damn. That's a lot. 
 [giggles] You saw the wall. 
 Well, congrats on all the changes, man, and, uh... if you ever need anything again, you have my number. 
 I do. 
 Good luck. 
 Thanks. Ride safe, okay? 
 Yeah, I will. 
 
 
 
 Here, Carl. I got you one. 
 Too cold. 
 You can drink it later. 
 Who was that? 
 Oh... just an ex. [chuckles] 
 Man : I don't feel like I'm able to even have a good time unless I'm somehow doing something... selfish. 
 Like, I can have a good time, but then I'll look back on it and it'll... I'll realize that I'm upsetting people or being inconsiderate somehow. 
 And I don't know why that me having a good time can't just exist with making other people feel good, but it... I guess I can't. I don't know. 
 Sounds like you're being really hard on yourself, man. 
 Well, I can't control it. 
 That's how I feel, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 You want any? 
 Yeah, uh... not tonight. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you though. 
 [phone chimes] 
 I mean, just do your best. 
 And that's relative, you know? 
 Sometimes your best is just puttin' your pants on for the day, you know? 
 But I don't mean like the nudity is a problem. 
 I don't mind the nudity at all. 
 That was just a saying. 
 Yeah. 
 Just to be clear. 
 Yeah, I get... I get what you mean. 
 Okay. 
 And thank you for listening. 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 Uh... so it's a hundred. 
 Oh, right. I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Er... 
 Uh-huh. 
 Woman : Oh, hey. 
 Oh, hey. Hello. 
 Hey, I don't know if Arthur told you, but, uh, we're looking for a new roommate, so if you know of anyone... 
 [stammers] Uh, not off the top of my head, but if I think about anyone, I will let you guys know. 
 Here you go, man. Uh, thanks so much. 
 Thank you for the tip. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I feel like I'm getting a little extra, you know, service. 
 Woman : Your charger. Um... give me a sec and I'll take a look. 
 I just got inside. 
 Woman on phone : I hope I didn't lose it Yeah. 
 Oh, Ju-Boo, don't worry about it. 
 If you forgot it, you can just get another one at the airport. 
 Or literally anywhere. 
 I made a packing list and everything, so... 
 Okay, I see why you forgot your charger. 
 What? I always smoke before a flight. 
 That's not why I forgot it. 
 I Ubered here and... 
 Oh, you Ubered to JFK. 
 Okay, I see how it is. 
 You fancy when you travel alone. 
 I know, I should have taken the train... 
 No, Ju-Boo, I'm just giving you a hard time. 
 You know I love when you treat yourself. 
 Oh, now I see your charger. 
 Good. Okay, it is there. 
 Yeah, it's here. 
 I'll just grab one when I get there. 
 [phone beeps] 
 Oh, honey, I'm getting another call, and it's work. 
 God, work? 
 Yeah, I have to go. 
 I'll text you when I land. 
 Yeah, text me when you get in, okay? 
 I will. I love you. 
 I love you. 
 Bye, babe. 
 Bye. 
 This is Gwen. 
 All right, why don't we file that for now and um, we'll see how far that gets us? 
 Coworker : Gotcha. Will do. 
 Okay. Talk Monday. 
 Yes, Monday. 
 Hopefully not sooner, right? 
 Right. 
 Yeah. Hopefully not sooner.

 Hey. 
 Hey. What's up? 
 You have an extra set of my keys still? 
 Uh... yeah. 
 I'm gonna have to look for them, but, uh, probably. 
 Is Jules around? 
 No. 
 She's out of town. 
 So what's up? Are you locked out? 
 Yeah. I mean... 
 I got f*cking robbed, man. 
 Oh, my god! Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I am, but... 
 I was in this vestibule, and these two dudes came in, and one of them had a gun, I think, maybe, I don't know... 
 Oh, my god. and then, like... f*cking took my sh1t. So, that's $1,000 just... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 It was really scary. 
 Yeah. I'm sure it was. 
 Yeah. 
 So that f*cking sucks. 
 Yeah. 
 And they took my bike key, which was the last one for that lock that I have, so I have to deal with that now. 
 Well, you know, it could have gone a lot worse. 
 But the thing is, it was my f*cking fault because I didn't f*cking double check a referral that came in to me last moment, and I thought I could just knock one off for the rest of the day. 
 [phone chirps] 
 Goddammit, this job was supposed to be way more f*cking chill than this! 
 Okay. Okay. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Just be glad you're okay. 
 Yeah. 
 And they didn't take my phone, which is good, I guess. 
 Unless I f*cking broke it just now. 
 Whatever. I just want to get into my apartment, man. Can I get my key? 
 Yeah, let me find the keys for you. 
 Oh, a package came for you. 
 Oh, sweet. Great. 
 Oh, this? 
 Ugh, okay. 
 Gwen : Jules read that book everybody's reading about sparking joy in the household or whatever, and I... can't f*cking find anything anymore because she threw out half our sh1t. 
 I've been hearing a lot about that book. 
 Every person I know is throwing out stuff. 
 Oh, nice. 
 What is that? 
 There are my friend's, uh, hash oil pens that he makes in California. He sends them to me. 
 So, you're still having weed delivered to this apartment? 
 Well... 
 I told him to send it to my new place. 
 I guess he didn't update his records. 
 That's not okay because you don't live here anymore. 
 I told him. I'll tell him next time, and, uh, it won't happen again. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Sorry. I'm sorry. 
 That... that's, um... great. 
 No, I get it. 
 So can I just maybe text Jules or... 
 No. Jules is in flight right now. 
 Oh, god. 
 Did you try Obed? 
 You know, Obed's really shitty about getting back to us. 
 You know, if you keep trying him, he eventually... 
 Can I just stay here in the guest bedroom if he doesn't though? 
 Yeah. Uh, if we can't find these keys and you can't get back into your apartment... 
 This is mine. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, this is definitely mine. 
 Great. 
 The Guy : f*ck. I'm gonna have to move if every time they're gonna f*cking... 
 "make improvements," it's gonna cost like an extra hundred bucks a month. 
 I don't want to f*cking move. I hate moving. 
 We're all moving if Trump wins. 
 But I don't want to move. 
 Now. 
 [quietly] f*ck. 
 f*ck! 
 I can't believe I got robbed, man.

 This is f*cking... 
 Stupid f*cking stoners. 
 No. Mas.

 So where'd Julie go? 
 She's in San Francisco. 
 She's helping our friend Laurel with a... booth she has at some trade fair. 
 That's the girl with the, um... 
 Sorry, is Laurel the woman with the greeting card company? 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's helping her with branding and... her website and stuff like that. 
 Goddamn. Jules is so good at that sh1t. 
 Yeah. 
 I gotta get my sh1t together, man. 
 I'm a mess. 
 I gotta, like, either get bigger or get smaller or do something, because, like, this is not what I had in mind. 
 Mm. 
 I am working so hard and I'm not working smart at all. 
 Mm. 
 I am just like... 
 I don't know. 
 This is totally mesmerizing. 
 I think so. 
 Wow... 
 You ever do a buffalo smile? 
 Um... no. I don't know what that is.

 It's like, how would a buffalo smile? 
 Can you do it with your face? 
 Oh, f*ck me. 
 It goes like this. 
 [phone vibrates] 
 I'm sorry. This is Gwen. 
 Coworker : Gwen? 
 You're working on the Jackson case too, right? 
 Yeah, that's correct. 
 Just wanted to get all the details squared away. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Since this is her last month... 
 Well, be that as that may, we're still talking about a pregnant 13-year-old girl here. 
 Right, but, you know... 
 Her stepfather is about to be released and her mother kicked her out, so no, she doesn't have that option. 
 The grandparents? 
 No, I'm not gonna recommend that, and it's not gonna fly anyway. 
 Her grandfather has abuse charges from 1998. 
 Oh! I didn't hear about that. 
 Yeah, so she can't go there. 
 Okay, well, uh... 
 Oh, well, maybe I need to send him a photograph of the frostbite she got on her fingers when she had to spend the night outside in below freezing weather. 
 Do you think he would understand it then? 
 Well, I'll just let him know, okay? 
 You do that. 
 I'll be... I'll be here all night. 
 Look, sorry to bother you. We'll take care of this, okay? 
 Okay. Great. You have a good night. 
 You too. 
 Bye. 
 What the f*ck is wrong with people? 
 I'm sorry you have to deal with that. 
 That's truly terrible. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 You want a hit of this pen? 
 It might... I don't know. 
 No, I... I'm good. Thank you. 
 [phone vibrates] 
 I'm just gonna... go... to the bar where Beth works. 
 Oh, you don't have to do that. 
 No, it's fine. 
 I'll just, uh, wait till she gets off work and then maybe I can go home with her. 
 That Australian girl? 
 Yeah. 
 That's nice. 
 We liked her. 
 Yeah. She's great. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. Well, good. 
 Um, I'll keep looking for your keys. 
 Thanks. 
 Uh... 
 Do you want this? 
 No, I'm good. I'm still good. 
 Sorry if I, uh, put you out at all. 
 No, of course not. Okay. 
 Goodnight. 
 Goodnight. 
 See you. I'll let myself out. 
 Okay. 
 Get that trim!

 [door closes] 
 [door opening] 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 No. 
 It's okay. 
 It's... It's really not okay. 
 Um, just listen. I... I... 
 I've had a crazy f*cking week and... 
 I was just looking forward to having the night. 
 I love her, but, you know, she takes up a lot of space. 
 Dude, I get it. 
 I was married to her. 
 But I... I'm really sorry. 
 This is not okay. I... 
 Gwen, take it easy. 
 Take a pause. Make a buffalo smile. 
 [chortles] 
 It's totally fine. Really. 
 Okay. 
 I appreciate you letting me lick my "whounds" in your space. 
 You're "whelcome." 
 Very "whelcome." 
 [chuckles] 
 I love you, man. I'll talk to you later. 
 Okay. I love you too, dude. 
 Be safe. 
 You too. 
 Okay.
