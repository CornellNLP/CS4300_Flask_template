 Howard : You always say you're gonna make stock and you never do! 
 Woman : I've made stock!

 You're gonna get it now. You are in for it, mister.

 Howard, I am so sorry. 
 Get out of here, get! 
 Howard : Aren't you feeding this guy? 
 Chase : Yeah, you know, he's been acting up lately. 
 You know, after everything with Tracy. 
 I think he can tell something's happening. 
 Howard : Yeah, looks like you're almost packed. 
 When are you out of here? 
 Chase : End of next week. 
 Howard : Wow, that's soon. 
 Chase : Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready. 
 I asked them just to move it along as fast as they could. 
 Howard : Probably a good time for a fresh start, huh? 
 Chase : Yeah, I've always wanted to live in New York City.

 Chase : Hey, Gats! 
 How did you get into the biz? 
 Woman (Australian accent) : Well, I was in a church... 
 An ayahuasca church in Brazil, and halfway through the ceremony I looked down and I was like, "Whoa, I'm really close to the ground, and I also have paws." 
 And then I was like, "sh1t, I'm a dog." 
 And when I got back to the city I thought, "I have to work with dogs, and I am a dog." 
 Chase : Uh, well, yeah. 
 I've never been to church in Brazil. 
 Um, but it sounds really spiritual, so... 
 Listen, I hate to run, but I am late. 
 Uh, if he pushes you around on the walk, just give him a smack on the behind, okay? 
 You know what? I think we're gonna have a great time. 
 Uh, bye. 
 (door closes) 
 (mockingly) Bye. 
 Hey, hey! Stop. 
 That's right. You stop right there. 
 Stay.

 Now keep staying. 
 All right, Gatsby, you come here. 
 Good boy. 
 Hi. Hi.

 You want one? 
 Okay. 
 Yes. 
 Get in there. 
 Here you go. 
 This is gonna work out beautifully. 
 Let's make some walkies.

 All righty! 
 Look there. 
 We've got a new friend. 
 Look who it is, this is Gatsby. 
 Gatsby, this is Musso and Frank. 
 Yeah, their butts smell really nice. 
 Get on in there. All right.

 Really horrible. Why would anyone want to see that, man? 
 We see it as having an application towards empathy training for prisoners, you know, to help them relate to their victims. 
 Yeah, well, it's pretty intense.

 Hey, girl. 
 Beth : Hey, dude, how you doing? 
 Yeah, man, I just took a look at the future. 
 It's pretty f*cking terrifying. 
 If you are feeling sad about the future, I can make you feel happy about the present because I just met the most amazing bubble man, and he told me about this crazy bubble show that is going down in Astoria Park at 4:30... 
 Astoria? 
 ...and I think... 
 Yes, Astoria. 
 What, you find the Pulaski Bridge a little too strenuous? 
 I think you can handle it. 
 The Guy : No, it's not that, really. 
 Listen. 
 Why don't you just jump on your bike, come to Queens, we'll smoke, and then we'll watch the show together, huh? 
 Don't pretend you don't love Queens.

 He's just saying hello. He's super friendly. 
 Aren't you? This is Gatsby. 
 Hey, Gatsby. Sorry about that. 
 What about the other doggies, they good? 
 Oh, the doggies were so good. 
 But you know what was better than the doggies? 
 The bubble man. 
 Bubble man. 
 All right. But before we do bubs, where do you want to do this? 
 In there. 
 You sure? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 All right. Sounds good. 
 In case you didn't notice, it smells like sh1t in here. 
 I did notice. 
 It's like, do your dishes, man. Just do 'em. 
 Or at least put them in the fridge until you're ready to do them. 
 I mean, that's what I do. 
 Yeah, that's also an option. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So you got me on the clock for bubs. 
 It better be good, man. 
 Oh, sh1t. That's a lot of expectation. 
 I don't want to build him up too much. 
 It's kind of more of a conceptual thing. 
 It's like, here's this guy, and he's just invented this job where he just goes out makes bubbles, makes people happy. 
 That's pretty cool, I guess. 
 And so I was thinking, maybe I should learn to do some bubs? 
 Yeah, bartender, uh, mushrooms, dog-walking, bubs. 
 Yes, please. 
 Oh, my... You got a, uh... 
 Oh, sh1t.

 I didn't see the movie. I just know the quote. 
 It's people's lives. It's not a movie. 
 Okay, I'm gonna put this maniac in the bedroom.

 You do what feels right, stud.

 What, are you throwing a party while I'm gone?

 I'm sure I don't need to tell you this, but what you did was just totally unprofessional. 
 Absolutely. 
 I feel like I... I used some really bad judgment. 
 Chase : Yeah. 
 If you change your mind, ever, you have a beautiful dog, and I... 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Really, I just... I think we're good here. 
 I'm sorry I let you down. 
 All right. I'll, uh... I'll let them know that you've turned in the keys.

 Hey, I'll be back soon, dude. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Wanna go for a walk? Huh? 
 Come on, let's go. 
 No? All right. Suit yourself, man. 
 Come on, Gats. Let's go outside. 
 Come on. 
 Really? 
 You're coming outside. Let's go. Come on. 
 Hey, you got to take a leak sometime, man. 
 Come on. You're not leaking in the house. 
 Let's go. 
 What's going on with you, man? 
 You can take the boy out of Indiana, but it's tough to get there.
