  Yeah. 
  Right. 
  ... and the doctor was telling my mom they might have to sacrifice him for me. 
  That if he survived, he would have almost no chance at a normal life.

  Hmm. 
  Three months early. 
  We were crazy premature. 
  Tiny, like little Beanie Babies. 
  Cute.

  He survived. 
  Just a slight walking disability, but that was it.
