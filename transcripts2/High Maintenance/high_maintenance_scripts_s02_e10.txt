  Davenport. 
   You have other places you'd rather be today, Mr. 
  Davenport?

   Deals to broker? 
   Mr. 
  Davenport would never wear this outfit.

   Dill, chives, rosemary. 
   Hell yeah! 
  It's like a salad. 
   Yeah, I guess. 
  [laughter] 
   I'm gonna see if this guy wants some. 
   - Buttermilk biscuit? 
  Yeah. 
  - Really? 
   - Yeah, thank you so much, man. 
  - Homemade. 
   There's probably a lot of butter. 
   Hey, can I actually get a hit off of that blunt? 
   [all agreeing] 
   Once you pop, you can't stop.

   Well, you are my chiropractor's step-daughter. 
   Hired solely out of nepotism,  'cause you know how hot I think nepotism is. 
   So hot. 
   I do have a meeting in Munich,  but I can probably... 
   - Cancel that for me? 
  - Push that around. 
   You're so important. 
   "If the right are the Nazis,  "then the left is the Red Army,  who were worse. 
  Stop with the lies."  - Wow. 
  - That makes no sense. 
   You should probably just stop responding to her, right? 
   No, no, no. 
  It's a f*cking obligation  to educate our ignorant, racist relatives. 
   True. 
  But maybe not on Facebook. 
   - I don't know, man. 
  - That's f*cked. 
  I'm sorry. 
   That's the end of this. 
   Is that the last joint that we had? 
   I think we're all out of wine, too. 
   You know, I can help on one of those fronts.

  Okay. 
   And we have some sparkling wine.

   Excuse me, sir. 
  Oh. 
   - That's your hammock? 
  - Uh, yeah. 
  Is everything okay? 
   You can't hang a hammock in the middle of the park. 
   Oh, okay, I can take it down. 
  You want me to take it down? 
   No, you know what? 
  Whatever. 
   It's cool. 
   Okay. 
   Hey, what are you doing? 
  Why do you keep coming over here? 
   You're being, like, um, so standoff-ish. 
   I just want to be with you. 
   Try something new. 
  Hang out with these... 
   - these peeps. 
  They're chill peeps. 
  - Let them be chill. 
   - I don't... 
  I'm not... 
  I just wanna... 
  - I want you to chill with us. 
   I don't want to, so have fun. 
   Now put your hand over my boob. 
   Oh, yeah, that's hot. 
   Mmm, no, let's keep this on, 'cause I don't know how to swim.

   Ow, but it... 
   Ow. 
  Ow. 
  It hurts though. 
  Okay, look at me. 
   [sighs] 
   Okay. 
  So, um... 
   I know that whenever we've talked about marriage,  that I've been kinda weird. 
   Oh, whoa. 
   I think it's a bit of misogyny and gender roles  - and stereotypes and... 
  - Yo! 
 
 
 
  Turn off the music! 
   And my parents are f*cking weird, and... 
   like, everyone we know, like, f*cks it up. 
   And I was just thinking about f*cking it up,  and that if I was gonna f*ck up the rest of my life,  that I-I would want you to be there. 
   And.. 
   I just... 
  I love you! 
  I love you so much. 
   I love you so much that it's... 
  it's stupid! 
   And I just wanna... 
  f*ck! 
  Um... 
   Do you wanna get married? 
   - Yes. 
  - Yeah?

   - All right. 
  - Yeah, so can we paddle for once? 
   Now I will help you, yes. 
   Okay, do you have dark spots in your vision? 
   I'm definitely seeing dark spots.

   That means they were creeping on us all afternoon. 
   There was somebody taking pictures of us.

  - No, you can't take it off. 
   That's exactly how Princess Diana died! 
   _ I just find that a little bit creepy.

   You're with your side dude, he has pictures of you with your side dude. 
   You had your titty out!
