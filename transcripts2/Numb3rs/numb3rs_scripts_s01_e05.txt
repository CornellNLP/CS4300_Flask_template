 ( music playing ) 
 ( children laughing and cheering ) 
 What's wrong? 
 I really should get back to work. 
 It's her sixth birthday party. Please, it's important. 
 Emily's having a great time. She won't even know I'm gone. 
 ( kids cheering ) 
 ( kids cheering ) 
 CLOWN: What's your favorite color? 
 Green! Blue! 
 Okay, what color is this? 
 ( classical music playing ) 
 ( sighs ) 
 Bye-bye. 
 Check or credit card'll be fine, Mrs. Burdick. 
 Oh, right, let me get my checkbook. Hold on. 
 Bye. 
 Hey, where you going? 
 EMILY: Mommy! 
 No, no, no! No, no! No! 
 ( screams ): Mommy! 
 Emily! Emily! Please! 
 Help me, Mommy! 
 Emily! 
 ( whimpers ) 
 Ethan! 
 ( siren wailing ) 
 ( indistinct voices ) 
 We've got Amber alerts up on freeway signs. 
 We've already received over 300 tips. 
 I promise you we'll run down every one of 'em. 
 What is this about? 
 Do you think they want money from us? 
 We're prepared for the possibility of a ransom demand. 
 We have maybe $3,000 in savings. 
 Our house is second-mortgaged. 
 At this point, we don't have enough information for a motive. 
 This form here -- it'll help you remember everyone who's been to your house within the last few months -- baby-sitters, gardeners... 
 You have a worksheet for this? 
 ( gasps ) 
 David... 
 We've got 36 registered s*x offenders just within three square miles. 
 We'll need to look at all of them. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 You guys got anything on the clowns? 
 We're collecting photographs and video taken at the party for a possible I.D. 
 Okay, the mother got 'em through the same company that supplied the party rentals. 
 About two days before the party, someone calls the company, says they're Ethan Burdick and cancels the clowns, although Ethan says it wasn't him. 
 So whoever planned this knew about the party, knew which rental company. 
 The mom, dad, both... 
 I watched them during the interview. 
 Neither one of them looked to the other for visual or verbal cues. 
 No indication of a rehearsed story. 
 If one of them's involved, the other one doesn't know about it. 
 I want to check out the dad's office. 
 Where's that? DAVID: That way. 
 All right. 
 What this is is abstract number theory, most of it dealing with prime numbers, which are numbers that can't... 
 I know what prime numbers are, Charlie. 
 You can't divide 'em into smaller ones. 
 Don, this is deep stuff. 
 This is very advanced work. 
 His name's Ethan Burdick. You know him? 
 No, I've never heard of him, although... you know, just a preliminary look at his work... 
 These ideas on the Critical Strip are... are elegant. 
 He's got an approach here I've actually never seen before. 
 Wait a minute. All this from a preliminary look at his work? 
 I'd say Ethan Burdick is seriously brilliant. 
 So brilliant he didn't notice his only kid being snatched right outside his window. 
 ETHAN: Yes, I will. 
 Who is he talking to? 
 Officer, take your guys in the backyard, on the side, and take them out of my house. 
 If I ask you to leave, you leave. Mr. Burdick... 
 That's it. End of argument. There's no discussion here. 
 I don't need your cooperation in this investigation. 
 Whoa, sir, sir, just talk to me. 
 I don't need the police, I don't need the FBI to find my daughter anymore. 
 Tell me who called you? 
 I need you to leave. Everyone, out of the house, now. 
 Sir, who called you? 
 CHARLIE: We all use math every day... every day... to predict weather... to tell time... to handle money... 
 Math is more than formulas and equations. 
 It's logic. 
 Math is more than formulas and equations. 
 It's rationality. 
 It's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know. 
 I told you people to leave. 
 Do you even have any idea what you're looking at? 
 Yes. You're making significant progress toward proving Riemann's Hypothesis. 
 Yeah. Very good. 
 You know something about advanced number theory. 
 Sorry. I should've introduced myself. 
 My name is Charlie Eppes. 
 I'm a professor at CalSci. 
 I should've recognized you. 
 I attended your lecture series on P vs. NP a couple years ago. 
 Your work showed a certain... insight. 
 Where'd you get your degree? 
 I studied at Cornell, but I never finished my doctoral thesis. 
 You've obviously done amazing work here. 
 You should, uh, have it published, get it out into the math community. 
 Yeah. 
 I actually, uh, have the solution. 
 You can prove Riemann's Hypothesis? 
 After 15 years, I should hope so. 
 So... Agent Eppes is...? 
 My brother Don. 
 In that case, I'm going to have to ask you to leave, too. 
 I'm sorry, I... Now. 
 What happened? 
 We were almost through the worksheet, uh, when he got the call on his cell phone. 
 David... 
 I screwed up. 
 Mr. Burdick, who contacted you? 
 We don't have to cooperate with this investigation. 
 If I ask you to leave, you're required to leave. 
 Sir, just please calm down. 
 Now, I got to tell you, taking advice from the people that kidnapped your daughter is not a good idea. Ethan, what's...? 
 Becky, I'm in control of the situation. 
 I know what's going on. Sir, you're wrong twice now. 
 That's what these people are counting on. 
 Now, I've been through this many times before. 
 We can greatly increase the chances of getting your daughter back, but you've just got to try and cooperate with us. 
 BECKY: Emily! 
 EMILY: Mommy! 
 We need to keep working the case. 
 Our job is to find the girl with or without the family's cooperation, right? 
 Yeah. I think that the kidnapping was way too much effort for a $3,000 payday. 
 Yeah. Hey, Charlie, let me ask you something. 
 The math thing that the father was working on -- is there any way that could be worth money? 
 Well, it is one of the Millennium Problems. 
 What's a Millennium Problem? 
 Seven, like, classic, difficult math problems. 
 The Clay Institute of Mathematics offers one million dollars for the solutions to each of them. 
 All right, well, that's motive. 
 So, how would he collect the award? 
 Well, first, the solution has to be published in a refereed journal. 
 Then it has to achieve general acceptance in the math community over the course of two years. 
 And then an advisory committee is convened... 
 It's possible somebody knows he's working on it but doesn't know how far off the award is. 
 Right, well, who else would know he was working on it? 
 I would check with the math journals, you know, because maybe he contacted some of them. 
 All right, why don't you give me some of those names? 
 Here, actually, you write it... 
 DAVID: The American Journal of Number Theory says you're the point man on papers for Riemann Hypothesis. 
 I've worked on it for two decades. 
 Occupational hazard in math -- getting known as the guy who can't stop trying to prove Riemann's -- but, uh, I'm not the first. 
 So, you referee the papers on the Riemann submitted to the journal, correct? 
 Yeah. 
 That's how I first met Ethan Burdick. 
 Now, two years ago, he wrote a letter announcing that he was getting close to a solution to the problem and that he was going to publish his findings once his work was complete. 
 Now, when he didn't, uh, follow up for several months, I went to see him. 
 I went back several times. Please. 
 What did you think, um, of his work? 
 Oh, it was brilliant, and he made significant breakthroughs, but it was never quite ready. 
 Now, a month ago, he wrote, saying that he was ready to announce a solution, and this time, he was sure. 
 ( sighs ) 
 You think Atwood knew something? 
 He was scared of something. 
 Look at this. 
 The list the Burdicks gave us? 
 The mother says a cable guy came by six weeks ago to upgrade the wiring. 
 Cable company has no record. 
 Well, you sure you got the right company? 
 Only one serves the area. 
 I think somebody was trying to get into Ethan Burdick's computer system. 
 You mean, like, a hacker? Yeah. 
 The mom booked clowns and rentals through the party company's web site. 
 All right, let's just say they're after this Riemann Hypothesis thing. 
 I mean, getting into Ethan's system would certainly tell them how far along he is. 
 Right? 
 It's Paul Ballard -- the clown. 
 Who's Paul Ballard? 
 Now, you investigated this guy for two other kidnappings? 
 TERRY: Yeah. Wife of a bank president, 15-year-old son of a security company chief. 
 Couldn't make a case either time. 
 Wife's body was found, boy's body was never recovered. 
 Match is 93% -- that's pretty good considering the heavy makeup. 
 Good catch Terry, you were right. 
 I should've seen it sooner. 
 We sent him away for tax evasion before you got to L.A. 
 Best we could do. 
 There was an early release initiative at McNeill Correctional Institute. 
 Ballard got out. No parole. 
 Hello. Hey. 
 Tell me you found Emily Burdick. 
 No, I'm sorry, buddy, not yet. 
 ALAN: Hey, take a look at this. 
 Here in the kitchen, I put in the new sink myself, and the, uh... I did the tile work. 
 WOMAN: Oh, it's beautiful work. 
 I like how you've preserved the original Craftsman detail. 
 Oh, hey, boys. Hi. 
 We didn't know you were home. 
 Meredith, my two sons -- this is Don and Charlie. 
 How are you? Hi, Don. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Pleasure. Hello, Charlie. 
 Oh, Meredith, would you mind going upstairs for a minute? 
 I'll be right with you. 
 Sure. 
 Um... Um... What? 
 Nice. She's cute. 
 What is this? 
 Oh, come on, Charlie. 
 Don't you remember we talked about this? 
 Talked about what? No. 
 I'm sorry, I should have made sure you were paying attention when I was ta... 
 Don't apologize, Dad. No, you have no idea what this is all about, trust me. 
 I don't think we want to know. 
 Well, you have to know. No, we don't, Dad. 
 Look, you're allowed to have a private life. 
 Wait a minute. Just hold it a second. This is not a date. 
 Oh, my... Dad, what are you telling me? 
 That this woman is a pr... 
 Real estate agent. 
 Oh, right. I'm confu... 
 Are you dating a real estate agent? 
 No, he's selling the house. 
 Yes... Why? I-I live here. 
 Don't you remember? You live here. 
 Don't you remember? 
 I said I wanted to find a smaller place for myself, maybe a condo. I remember that, sure. 
 You need a place of your own. 
 But I didn't think you were serious. 
 You can't sell our house. What are you saying? 
 This is our house. Look, the market is... the market is at its peak right now. 
 Yeah, but I live here. 
 We are living... we are living on a very large part of my retirement savings. 
 He's right. Prices are high. 
 Believe me, I've looked around. 
 Can we... do me a favor... 
 I like how it looks upstairs; it's great. 
 I love the solarium. 
 Oh, you haven't seen the outside. 
 I do my best work in the solarium. 
 ( loud clanging thump ) 
 Oh, that's the heating system. 
 It's a little temperamental. 
 It needs a little finessing. I'll show you later. 
 Just wanted you to see this here, at the front of the house, we have, uh... 
 ( door shuts ) 
 Look, relax. 
 I got a great apartment in a great neighborhood. 
 You'll find one, too. 
 Then why are you over here all the time? 
 Because I'm making sure you let Dad have a life. 
 ( doorbell ringing ) 
 Mrs. Burdick... Agent Lake. 
 I need a minute of your time, please. 
 Have you ever seen this man? 
 No. 
 I think this is the man that has Emily. 
 He's kidnapped before and gotten away with it. 
 Ethan says... You need to let us help you. 
 Ethan says he can get Emily back. 
 Your husband thinks that he is in control of something he is definitely not in control of. 
 These other kidnappings -- did those families cooperate with you? 
 Yes. 
 But you say he got away with it. 
 And he's still out there, and he's taken our daughter. 
 With your help, we can get him this time. 
 I don't care about him, Agent Lake. 
 I care about Emily. 
 My husband, the smartest man I have ever met... when he says he knows what he's doing, I believe him. 
 Mrs. Burdick... 
 Okay, what's the biggest number you can think of? 
 Um, a gazillion -- is that a real number? 
 ( laughs ): No. 
 A quadrillion. 
 Quadrillion -- that's 1,000 trillion, or 1 followed by 15 0's. 
 Or it can be written like this. 
 Now, this is how many protons are in the entire known universe. 
 And this is the size of the numbers used to encrypt Internet transactions. 
 Huge numbers. 
 But for encryption, we don't use just big numbers. 
 We use big numbers that are built by multiplying large prime numbers, because, see, primes are the basic building blocks of mathematics. 
 And as far as we know, they occur at random intervals along the number line. 
 Because of that, it's incredibly hard to take a giant number apart and break it down to its prime components, okay? 
 I mean, that's basically how Internet security works. 
 A large, unknown prime number hidden inside a giant number that can't be broken down. 
 DAVID: So, the reason hackers can't break the encryptions is because of the sheer complexity of the math? 
 Exactly, and it is complex. 
 In 1977, three mathematicians challenged the readers of Scientific American to factor a 129-digit number. 
 It took hundreds of people 17 years to do it. 
 What does this have to do with Burdick's Reimann thing? 
 His work can help find large primes, making it easier to create what we call a "number sieve --" a tool that takes this and finds the primes that built it. 
 Once you have that, you can find the decryption constant and get in -- into people's bank accounts, into their credit card transactions, practically any secure website. 
 Wait a minute. That's why they took the girl. 
 It's not Burdick's money they're after; it's everyone's. 
 TERRY: That's why Ballard took the girl. 
 She's his tool to get the big score. 
 Look at this; he's in the wind. 
 Phony addresses, offshore accounts, bogus P.O. boxes. 
 Terry, let me ask you something. 
 Yeah? What happened? 
 What's the deal? 
 This guy got under your skin or something? 
 Yeah, uh... I was there when the found the bank president's wife's body. 
 Got a two-week suspension for running the Ballard tax case on my own. 
 Assistant Director said I was on a vendetta. 
 And were you? Yeah, probably. 
 Well, look, first of all, a guy like Ballard's going to need someone with computer skills and an advanced knowledge of math to pull something like this off. 
 Maybe he's got a crew that consists of a hacker and a mathematician. 
 Here's an idea on the hacker. 
 I searched for people who did jail time with Paul Ballard, checked against records for computer crimes. 
 Came up with Carl Mittendorf. 
 Mittendorf. 
 I remember this kid. 
 He hacked into some big financial newsletter, right? 
 Yeah, right. 
 Made investments off what they were going to recommend. 
 Nailed by the SEC for insider trading. 
 Let me guess -- his cellmate was Paul Ballard? 
 Well, let's pick him up. 
 We can't. 
 Skipped his last two parole appointments. 
 Police got no leads on his whereabouts. 
 Do you guys know anything about a hacker named Carl Mittendorf? 
 Mittendorf? Yes. 
 Sure. He's good. 
 He's famous for hacking into his math professor's computer and changing the grades. 
 Poor Dr. Atwood, yes, already infamous for his failure to prove the Reimann Hypothesis. 
 Atwood -- you mean Steven Atwood? 
 Yeah, that's him. 
 Carl Mittendorf took classes from Atwood? 
 They know each other? 
 Thank you. 
 Now, Dad, I've been checking around. 
 You were right about the house. You were right. 
 Yeah, the real estate lady said that this property on the current market, I can expect competing bids. 
 Dad, am I, uh...? 
 Do I bug you? 
 What? What kind of a question is that? 
 Well, it's just, you know -- my math work, and uh... 
 ( clearing throat ) 
 I never listen, and I'm always in my own world. 
 Well, that sort of makes you the ideal housemate, doesn't it, Charlie? 
 Hmm. Well, I just wanted to make sure. 
 Make sure of what? 
 You're selling the house because you want to do it for... yourself. 
 No, Charlie, I want to do it for both of us. 
 I thought we were having a good time. 
 We are. 
 It's just that this house is so big, and it takes so much work to maintain it. 
 And besides, you're almost 30. 
 Don't you think it's about time you found a place of your own? 
 I love this house. 
 So do I. 
 But still, the both of us, we have to move on. 
 Let's just put it together. 
 DAVID: Burdick tells Atwood he's cracked Riemann's. 
 Atwood sees potential for a heist, tells Carl Mittendorf. 
 TERRY: Mittendorf calls Paul Ballard, the kidnap specialist. 
 Well, we'll try one more time to see if we can get Burdick to cooperate. 
 If we can be there for the hand-off... 
 I mean, you know, we might get lucky and they'll lead us right to the kid. 
 Burdick thinks he can do this without us, we won't get in the front door. 
 Well... maybe Charlie will. 
 What the he...?! 
 Uh, Becky! 
 Becky! 
 I told her I was here to help you. 
 But you're not. You're here to talk your brother in the door. 
 And in case you haven't realized it, I don't have time to waste. 
 I think you'd be better off letting him do his job because he's actually pretty good at it. 
 They've figured out that the kidnappers want your proof on the Riemann Hypothesis, your work on number sieves. 
 Well, that's not exactly the stuff of Sherlock Holmes. 
 They're going to use its capabilities to break Internet encryption. 
 Which means... they'll expect you to distill it down to an algorithm. 
 That would be a huge job under normal circumstances, But Ethan, with a time limit, the stress of your daughter's... 
 Yeah, I know that, I know, okay? 
 15 years of work... my life's work... and I have to process it into an algorithm for people who don't give a damn. 
 To give it up like that. 
 It's like a part of me is dying. 
 I understand that. 
 More than that, more than anything, I-I need to get Emily back. 
 Let me help you. 
 I'm not suggesting a collaboration. 
 It's obviously all your work... 
 I don't care about that anymore. It's... 
 I need your help. 
 Well, you got it. 
 ( sighs ) 
 ( sobbing ) 
 Ah, here's the next section. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, okay, yeah, no, I see how this works... 
 I'm sorry, I see. 
 But, um... see, um... I'm still not so sure that I follow from this point... how we get to here. 
 See what I'm saying? 
 I-I think I... I have another... there's another notebook. 
 Okay. 
 CHARLIE: Hmm. 
 What's wrong? 
 This material for the number sieve... 
 I don't see how a working algorithm can be built from this. 
 I don't see anything that supports the expansion of the zero-free region into the critical strip. 
 Ethan? 
 Uh... I don't... 
 I'm not really sure... 
 Ethan, all your conclusions emanate from this point. 
 If it's not fairly solid, we can't get to where we need to go. 
 I know. 
 It doesn't work. 
 It doesn't work, it... it needs... we have... 
 It has to work, so we need to fix it. 
 You and I -- we have to fix this. 
 It's a 150-year-old math problem. 
 You know, we can't just solve it because we want to or because we need to. 
 How about because my daughter's life depends on it? 
 How about because she's going to die when they realize... there's nothing? 
 There's nothing. 
 There's nothing to give them for her life. 
 They bought me some games, and they let me eat whatever I want, like pizza. 
 But I miss you. 
 They said I can come home if Daddy helped them with a math problem. 
 And you can do it, Daddy, 'cause you're the best at math. 
 I told them. 
 ( transmission stops ) 
 TERRY: When did this come in? 
 A few hours after I asked you to leave. 
 The man on the phone said to distill the theorems into an algorithm, that we'd be contacted later. 
 ( under his breath ): All right, explain something to me. 
 So he was lying the whole time? 
 No, he wasn't lying. He was convinced that he had it. 
 And you can't do it? 
 Don, you just asked me to solve one of the world's biggest mysteries in a few hours. 
 Charlie, you got me thinking you can do anything with numbers. 
 No. 
 What do you think we should do now? 
 Well, same thing I did when I was in school and I didn't know the answer -- fake it. 
 Ethan, look, we're going to do everything we can to get your girl back. 
 How? 
 We're going to give them Reimann's. 
 But I don't have it. 
 Yeah, well, you got something that looks a hell of a lot like it. 
 My brother's right. 
 We can work off your principles and compose an algorithm that should be able to pass initial scrutiny. 
 So you'll make the drop, and we're going to track it. 
 Thank you. 
 Ah, you can thank me when we're done. 
 Now, Charles, I've been thinking about your housing situation. 
 If your father sells the house, I have 800 square feet I'm not using. 
 Yeah, there's certainly room enough for you in that huge, old place. 
 Huge, old place? 
 It's 1877 Victorian that I've restored inside, outside. 
 My equity has soared exponentially in the last ten years. 
 That's why my dad's selling. 
 All the equity on the home. 
 There it is. I got it. 
 Hey, you just said you wanted something to eat, right? 
 You're hungry? Sure. 
 Come with me. Come-come with me. 
 Kyono? 
 Yeah? 
 Special Agent David Sinclair. 
 Oh, too bad. 
 You have nice eyes. 
 I'd like to ask you a few questions about Carl Mittendorf. 
 Do you guys have, like, a file for me under "ex-girlfriend" or something? 
 Have you seen Carl recently? 
 No. He got busted, I got scarce. 
 Did he ever attempt to contact you when he was in prison? 
 He tried. 
 Wanted to get together when he got out, which was not going to happen. 
 
 
 
 Why not? What was he into? 
 Look, I don't really like the guy, he's a bit of a creep, which I found out the hard way, but I don't want to get him in trouble. 
 I mean, he's harmless. 
 He spouts off all the time about stuff he never does. 
 Kyono, he's not harmless. 
 The life of a small child might be at stake. 
 Carl? No way. 
 He always had these big schemes, but he wound up doing stupid, little stuff. 
 He called me right before he got out. 
 He said he'd gotten in on something really big. 
 Like that was going to impress me or something. 
 Do you know what this big thing is? 
 Something about the biggest hacking job ever. 
 Said he was going after the biggest financial secret in the world. 
 The world's biggest financial secret. 
 That you get by breaking Internet encryption. 
 Some huge merger, acquisition? 
 FDA approval of a new drug? 
 No, that's a large single point investment. 
 The SEC would be all over that. 
 Financial secret that would allow you to make a broad range of investments that can't be traced back to you. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 DON: How's it coming? 
 CHARLIE: Good. The way we're setting it up, it'll take Atwood a while to notice it's incomplete. 
 DON: How you doing, Ethan? 
 So, wait, I can't believe Stephen's involved. 
 He was my colleague, my friend. 
 Well, look, we've checked into his financial status. 
 In the last two months, your friend liquidated all of his assets which definitely gave him enough cash on hand to make some investments. 
 So when we finish this, what's the next step? 
 Well, whatever they ask. 
 We take the information, we give them the formula. 
 We just have to make sure we have enough time before they figure out it's not going to work, right? 
 They're going to factor big numbers, so they'll need to use a supercomputer. 
 But there's only so many of them. 
 But we can monitor who's using them during the time they need to run the algorithm. 
 Unless they built their own. 
 Wait, you can build a supercomputer? 
 Yeah, by linking a lot of smaller computers together, using them for parallel processing. 
 Then we're looking for someone who bought a lot of high-end computer equipment? 
 It'll also pull a lot of electrical power, about 200,000 watts. 
 The DEA tracks high electrical usage, looking for marijuana growers. 
 Oh, yeah? How would you know something like that? 
 I read an article in The New Yorker. 
 Be hard to keep a supercomputer cool. 
 It requires units of liquid Freon. 
 All right, well, we can track that. 
 DAVID: Don? 
 Excuse me. 
 ( sotto voce ): This just arrived by messenger. 
 Dropped at the messenger company. 
 No witnesses. 
 ( distorted voice on tape): We will know in 12 hours from delivery if the solution works. 
 If it doesn't... your daughter dies. 
 So put everything on computer files and call 818-555-0175. 
 By 6:00 tonight. 
 Was it all right that time? 
 That gives us 14 hours. 
 With no hand-off. 
 It's an Internet hand-off. 
 If we can trace where they're coming from. 
 A hacker with Mittendorf's skills, won't be easy or likely. 
 ( crying ): You said, if we cooperated... you said we'd get our daughter back. 
 Ma'am, we're doing everything we can. 
 I think there's a way. 
 Reimann's is a master key -- it opens all doors. Doesn't it, Ethan? 
 Well, they have a plan to open just one door -- it's a really important door. 
 Now, we can't give them the master key, but we can open that door for them by creating a false master key. 
 And by designing the lock it opens. 
 If we can figure out what door it is they're trying to open. 
 Yeah, the question becomes what's the world's biggest financial secret? 
 Say this... this is the financial information that the kidnappers want, right? 
 And then, um, this here... yeah, here, that's the Internet location where it can be found. 
 Okay? Yeah. 
 So once we know what this is, we can... build a security wall around it. 
 With our own special lock, designed only to respond to the false key that we will provide them with. 
 That way, when they try to access this... 
 We catch them with their hand in the Internet cookie jar. 
 They think they've cracked the system, but it's a set-up. 
 We know they're coming. We can watch for the break-in, then track them back through the net by marking the data we know they've taken. 
 Forcing them to leave a cyber trail. 
 Yeah, but it still doesn't deal with the fact that we don't know what they're after. 
 We know Ballard likes big payoffs that can't be traced. 
 It's interest rates. 
 Dad wants to sell the house, because he's worried that interest rates are going to go up. 
 DAVID: The Federal Reserve Board's announcement's due in, like, two days. 
 I mean, that's a full 24 hours after the kidnappers' deadline. 
 With the information classified until the actual announcement. 
 The prime interest rate affects the cost of bonds and currency, precious metals, real estate. 
 If he knows about it in advance, he can make investments across the board -- foreign currencies, foreign commodity markets -- extremely profitable, impossible to track. 
 We should see if they set up any accounts in any of those areas. 
 And we should also get our people building a fake interface to the Federal Reserve. 
 I'm on it. This could be something. 
 How are we doing? 
 We built the false key. 
 Amita's creating a transparent tracer that's silently pinging the kidnappers' computer. 
 ( phone rings ) 
 Yeah. Eppes. 
 Hey, we're on track with the Federal Reserve rate. 
 Atwood just opened up a range of new accounts -- commodities, precious metals, treasury bonds, mortgage companies, poised to profit off a change in the prime rate. 
 Anything with Ballard? 
 Nothing. Guy like that knows how to cover his tracks. 
 You all right? Yeah. 
 Terry, we're going to get this guy. 
 Okay? 
 David, you there? 
 Yep. We're monitoring traffic on the Fed's database. 
 Anybody goes fishing for classified interest rate data, we'll know it. 
 ( phone rings ) 
 The number you have reached is not in service at this time, and there is no new number. 
 Please be sure you have checked the telephone directory for the right... 
 Carl Mittendorf knows how to work the phone system. 
 They know we called. Trust me. 
 Sir, here we go. 
 All right, send it. 
 ( typing ) 
 Whoa. 
 CHARLIE: Should take them several hours to generate an encryption key. 
 Then they'll think they have what they need to crack the Federal Reserve. 
 ( beeping ) 
 They're here. 
 Someone's just come in. 
 They've got the fake encryption key, and they're coming in via the false firewalls. 
 He's walking right in. 
 Lock and key fit together perfectly. 
 What's he going after? 
 The classified prime interest rate, just like you guys said. 
 Great. 
 He's out. Got a location?! 
 It's down to two cell towers. 
 He broke off. 
 He's gone. 
 We've got a residence on the power drain list. 
 Cross-check it with the list for Freon purchases. 
 It's there. We got it. 
 Good, grab it. Let's go. 
 MAN: He's got it, definitely. 
 ( garbled voice ) 
 ...the Federal Reserve is going to up the prime interest rate -- oh, you'll like this -- by a full half point. 
 Between bonds, foreign currency, precious metals, we're looking at making 200, maybe $300 million. 
 There's Mittendorf. 
 Anyone got a sign on the girl? 
 Negative. 
 Negative. 
 You know what? I think you guys should get your team in place. 
 Something's off. 
 Feels like the algorithms are incomplete. 
 Ballard... we've got him. 
 Don't need Carl and the Professor anymore. 
 Get rid of them. 
 Let's get to the airport. 
 We'll start moving the money once we... 
 All right, I want to go. Let's move, let's move. 
 All units, let's move, let's move. 
 Look, um, I-I don't like this. 
 Relax. No, no. Relax. 
 MITTENDORF: Please... have a beer. 
 While you're at it, get me one, too. 
 Where's the professor? 
 Whoa. Calm down, I was just cleaning it. 
 I-I don't, I don't know where he, he just... he went to get me a beer. 
 Let's get back to work. 
 Execute, exec... 
 FBI! Warrant! 
 FBI! Warrant! Warrant! 
 FBI! Don't move, get back! 
 FBI! Warrant! FBI! 
 Get on the floor! Don't move! 
 F-B-I! Get down! You! Get down! 
 You got my thumb?! I got your thumb. 
 Door clear. Get on the floor! 
 Where's Ballard? Where's the girl? 
 She's in the basement. I've got Atwood. 
 DAVID: The girl's in the basement. 
 Hey, Emily, come here. I'm here to take you home. 
 No you're not. 
 Back away. 
 Put her down. 
 Back up! 
 Just put the gun down. 
 Don't even think about it. Put your weapons down. 
 It's not going to happen. 
 TERRY: I have a shot. I can take him. 
 I'm telling you right now, it's not going to happen. 
 Put her down, or you're dead. 
 Come on. Come on now. 
 Come on, sweetie. 
 I gotcha. 
 Hands behind your back. 
 Hey, look who I got. We're taking her home. 
 Hey. 
 I remember you... 
 I was kind of hoping you would. 
 Get him out of here. 
 Emily! Emily! 
 Mommy! Daddy! 
 Hi, honey. 
 Mommy, daddy! 
 You okay honey? I missed you! 
 Thank you so much. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Missed you so much. Are you okay? 
 ETHAN: Did they hurt you? 
 I bet you were so scared! 
 ALAN: How is it I always end up loading the dishwasher? 
 You were the one that wanted to flip a coin. 
 I know, but I lost the last five times. 
 And what's the odds of that happening? 
 Never mind. Don't tell me. 
 You know, I did get an offer on the house. 
 Actually, it was a great offer. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 The buyer didn't even have to take out a mortgage. 
 He's, uh, paying real cash. 
 That's great. 
 Charlie, I'm accepting the offer. 
 Glad to hear that. 
 Really? 
 You, uh... you're all right with this? 
 Well, it's like you said. 
 I need to find my own place. I agree. 
 And being a tenured professor, I have money, enough to buy a house that I like. 
 Well, you know, today's market... 
 I know you make a good salary, but... 
 And I also do a lot of consulting, and not just for the FBI. 
 Plus I've won all sorts of awards. 
 And you never have to pay any of it out for rent, or food or utilities. 
 That is true. Yeah. 
 Dad? 
 Yeah. 
 The offer's from me. 
 You're serious? 
 I asked the real estate lady to let me be the one to tell you. 
 ( snorts ) 
 Charlie, this is crazy. 
 What's crazy? It's a good investment. 
 How else would you want me to spend my money? 
 I just figured you'd, uh, get a place of your own. 
 This is a place of my own. 
 And you can stay here, too... if you want. 
 Just like you said, you know, I never paid any rent, so you wouldn't have to either. 
 Yeah, all right, all right, Charlie, you know, I get it. 
 I just don't think you realize what you're getting yourself into. 
 How's that? I've lived here pretty much my whole life. 
 I think I'm used to it by now. 
 ( clanking ) 
 Uh, that'll be the furnace in your newly-acquired home. 
 There's a wrench in the basement. 
 I'm sure you can figure it out.
