 Citizen Z : Good morning, people. Welcome to the third day of the sixth month of the year 03 A.Z. If you're listening to this, it means you're still alive. So congratulations. Or condolences. You know, whatever. 
 If you're noticing more despair in my voice than usual today, it's because we lost someone special. I know, we lose people all the time. Getting your face chewed off by a Z is more common than making it to your next birthday. But this guy... This one's worth mentioning. 
 Charles Garnett, First Sergeant, Army National Guard Reservist, was an honest to God, real life, actual good guy. He fought for other people, not just for his own survival. And he did something that's pretty much impossible these days. He gave people hope. Remember hope? Remember thinking that we might actually come out on the other side of this thing? Yeah. That. Sergeant Garnett died trying to give us a reason to hope. And for that... Sergeant Charles Garnett. On behalf of a grateful nation, or whatever the hell we are now, we salute you. 
 [pop] 
 Mack : Radiator? 
 Doc : Yeah. 
 Mack : Fixable? 
 Don't know. 
 Gee, if we only had a mechanic. 
 You got to let her deal, man. 
 She's got that post-traumatic stress. 
 She's got post-traumatic stress? 
 The whole world's got post-traumatic stress. 
 Actually there isn't anything post about it. 
 We all got plain ol' present tense, all traumatic, all stress all the time. 
 What makes her so special? 
 Hey. Wake up. Hey. 
 No, you can't just check out. 
 We got a job to do. 
 And I am running out of time. 
 And California is still 2,000 miles of bad road away. 
 And we are<i> not</i> gonna make it without you. 
 Cuz it's not like they're gonna follow me or the old man or the wonder twins out there. 
 Hey. 
 All right, Addy and I will scout up ahead. 
 See if we can get some help. 
 We will? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I dunno, guys. I think we should stick together. 
 No, Doc. Don't worry. 
 We're just gonna scout ahead and circle back around and find you. 
 I mean it's not like you're getting far in the truck. 
 Come on, Addy. 
 I can't believe I'm saying this, but what if Warren doesn't snap out of it? 
 She's not giving up. 
 All right, well we can't just sit here and wait for help to come. 
 I mean we got to do something. 
 Okay. 
 [bike revving] 
 (10K) I found the leak in the radiator hose. 
 Taped it up a little bit, but we're not going anywhere unless we get some water in there. 
 I get thirsty. 
 We all get thirsty. 
 I'll drive. 
 Knock yourself out, kid. 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 Easy there, kid! Easy! 
 Who taught you how to drive? 
 Ahhh... no one. 
 Hands on the ten and the two. 
 And easy on the gas. 
 Nothin' out here. 
 No people, no gas, not even Zs. 
 Nah, we got to go back. 
 There is no help out here. 
 There's no help back there either. 
 We have to go back, Mack. 
 We have a mission. 
 We made a promise. 
 No, we didn't. 
 We never did. 
 Addy, the only promise we ever made was to each other. 
 To stay alive. 
 Look, yeah, okay. 
 Maybe we didn't say the words and we didn't sign an oath. But we all stand for each other. 
 We don't leave each other behind. 
 Garnett came back for me when those cannibals kidnapped me. 
 And now you want to leave Warren? 
 She needs us. 
 They all need us. 
 I just think maybe we have a better chance on our own. 
 Like in the beginning. 
 Mmm-hmmm. 
 So how long? 
 What? 
 How long before you think that you have a better chance on your own? 
 Addy. Whoa. 
 Hey. 
 I came back for you. 
 Hmmm? 
 The cannibals. 
 I came back for you. I'll always come back for you. 
 You know me. 
 I'm not so sure anymore. 
 About anything. 
 All right. 
 We'll go back. 
 Okay. 
 Go right. 
 Why right? 
 Why not? 
 No Zs. 
 That's a good sign. 
 Getting interesting. 
 Liquor! Now you're talking. 
 Murphy, we're gonna have to let you navigate more often. 
 [Doc and Murphy laugh] 
 Congratulations, son. You're now the designated driver. 
 What's that mean? 
 It means step on it! 
 [Doc and Murphy laugh] 
 [rumbling] 
 [whispering] I've never seen so many in one place. 
 [whispering] So much for going back.

 Welcome to S&S Limited, the finest gun show in the west. 
 Entry fee is seven. 
 Seven what? 
 Bullets. 
 Oxy. 
 Grams of whatever DIY super fun time substance you got. 
 Well I think I got some crystal back in the truck. 
 It's the good stuff too. Yeah. 
 Back off with the toilet bowl cleanser meth. 
 We only take that genuine vein splittin' take you right out of this beautiful apocalypse and into a hell-hole meth. 
 Well slap my ass and call me Sally if it ain't Sketchy McClain. 
 How'd you get way out here? 
 We traded our way up in the world. 
 Here. 
 You see zombies, they move in mysterious ways. 
 We were on our last legs when we came upon this truckload of sweet weaponry under attack. 
 We had to give the former owners mercy. 
 And in return, they gave us this wonderful vehicle with enough gas to get us here to Kansas. 
 Oh. 
 Hey, Skeezy! 
 Look what the living dead dragged in! 
 Doc! 
 I heard you were toast back at Camp Blue Sky! [laughs] 
 Don't just stand there. Get your ass in here. 
 We need another sucker. 
 Doc : Bite me, Skeezy. 
 Hey, I got to show you the new and improved Z-Whacker. 
 [both laughing] 
 Hey, speaking of Z-Whacker what happened to the girl you were with? Did she... 
 No, man. We're still traveling together. 
 They went ahead looking for help. 
 Kinda thought they'd end up here. 
 No, haven't seen them. 
 And I'm pretty sure I'd notice. 
 [laughing] 
 Here we've got our latest innovations in zombie fighting technology. 
 Small arms. Hot potato. 
 Siege weapons. 
 Brain-obliterators. 
 You name it, we got it. 
 Just sit back, relax, and forget about the apocalypse. 
 Aren't you worried about the Zs? 
 Look around. 
 We're in the middle of nowhere Kansas. 
 We're surrounded by hundreds of square miles of nothing but fallow farmlands. 
 There's no Zs here. Nothing for them to eat. 
 They've all moved on to the big cities. 
 Don't you worry. 
 I'll protect you. 
 Yeah, but anyway, if one were to come amble by, to say we're prepared is an understatement, right? Uh, over there is the FU-Bar. 
 Home to the finest and probably actually the only corn whiskey and moonshine between here and the Miss... 
 Whoa. Somebody's thirsty. 
 Listen man, we need a new vehicle. 
 Ours is dying a slow death. You think you could help us out? 
 You know, for old time's sake? 
 No can do, my friend. 
 I'm an entrepreneur, not a philanthropist. 
 But there might be a way you can help yourself. 
 Our first annual live zombie shooting contest. 
 What's the prize? 
 Hey, Vernon. Show our friends here first prize. 
 [laughing] 
 Wow. 
 That a real 50 caliber M82 Barret? 
 Genuine. 
 Plus we'll even throw in a few hundred rounds of shells. 
 Seems like a little overkill. 
 Yeah. But there's a lot of guys who like their toys. 
 A lot of guys who might be willing to trade a vehicle for a sweet piece of steel like that 50. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Where do I sign up? 
 You think you got what it takes, little man? 
 This kid could kill a Z at 50 yards away with a rubber band and a paper clip. 
 All right. Sign ups in the FU-Bar. 
 If you do win and you want to trade it for a bad mama jama vehicle, you wanna talk to a guy named Wannamaker. 
 Oh and if you want side action talk to Vernon. 
 But do<i> not</i> bet against that guy. 
 Darren Cooper. 
 Ex Ranger Sniper. 
 Fifty confirmed kills in Afghanistan. 
 Lethal as they come. 
 Hey. 
 You got to do something about her. 
 I'm not waiting for anybody. 
 I know, Murphy. Keep your shorts on. 
 Have you seen a guy in here named Wannamaker? 
 What, are we making friends now? 
 Anybody know anybody in here named Wannamaker? 
 Who wants to know? 
 Oh, we're just lookin' to trade. 
 You know just a little business. 
 Yeah, my friend said he might have a vehicle. 
 Yeah. 
 Wannamaker's got cars. 
 Do you know where he is?

 Uh, hey! Uh, hello! 
 He's not gonna wake up. 
 Once Wannamaker's down, he's down. 
 Check back in forty-eight hours.

 You look like a car man. 
 I don't drive cars. 
 I drive machines. 
 Any, uh, any machine you'd be willing to let go of? 
 Depends. 
 What do you got to trade? 
 Don't worry, darlin'. You're not worth it. 
 Ain't nothing as sweet as the Formanmobile. 
 What about that 50 caliber first prize? 
 Ha! 
 Even if you do win, and that's a big if, the Formanmobile is not for sale. 
 Bio-diesel. 
 Solar-powered. 
 Quiet as they come. 
 Kitchen. 
 Bathroom. 
 Fully regenerative internal plumbing system complete with marine grade PEX fittings.
