 Previously on Z-Nation. 
 Citizen Z : Well, people. If we weren't already in an apocalypse, this would be a damn obvious sign. What do you call something worse than an apocalypse? Because this is it. Whatever it is. Swarm. Horde. Zunami. There's no end in sight. If you're not already west of this thing, you better get moving. There's no getting through it. There's no outrunning it. You got to find someplace safe and hide. Good luck, people. And Godspeed. [clank] [explosion] [gunfire] [gunfire continues] [slicing] [slice] [slice] [growling] [growling] Warren : Where are we? About a hundred miles north of Flagstaff I'm thinking. I dunno how much longer this old bucket of bolts is gonna keep running. Talking about yourself or the rig? Both. I think we're getting near the Grand Canyon. I went there once when I was a kid. It was beautiful. What? Can't believe I was a kid once? What's that? I've been watching it for a while. I hope it's not what I think it is cuz it's right where we're going. We need some recon. How's that radio coming? About to find out. Okay. [whining sound] Northern Light. Northern Light. Do you copy? Northern Light. This is Delta X-ray Delta. Do you copy? When's the last time you talked to that guy anyway? Probably isn't even alive anymore. Aren't you a ray of sunshine this morning? Well excuse me, princess. That's what happens when you haven't had a decent cup of coffee in half a decade. Citizen Z. This is your old pal. Addison Carver. Do you copy? [growling] Where the hell do you dudes keep coming from? [gunshot] [splat] [growling] sh1t! [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [splorch] That's right. I've been practicing. [broken with static] Citizen Z. Do you copy? [growling] Oh sh1t! [growling] [growling] [screaming] [gunshot] [breathing heavily] [broken] Citizen Z. I know you're out there. [broken] It's me. Addy. Do you read me? Addy? [broken] Citizen Z. Keep reaching out. Do you copy? Holy crap. She's still alive. Come on, Citizen Z. I know you're out there. You got to be. Do you read me? Addy. Addy, I hear you. I copy you. It's me, Citizen Z. [laughing] Man, it's great to hear your voice. It's so good to hear your voice. Can't believe you're still alive. How's the package? He hates being called that! The name is Murphy! The Murphy! Thanks to you, blabbermouth! Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I... I didn't mean to sic the whole world on you. Yeah, right. Oh yeah. Excuse me? We're gonna need those coordinates. Right. Ah hey, Citizen Z? We need you to transmit the GPS coordinates again. Last time the transmission was breaking up. We didn't get them all. Repeat. Re-transmit GPS coordinates. Over. Yeah, roger that. I'll send them as soon as I can find them. Place is kind-of a mess. Zombie issues. Copy you. Listen. There's a massive Z storm headed your way. I strongly suggest that you turn south. Possibly as far as Mexico before you can outflank this horde. It's miles wide, and it's moving fast. No, no, no. We got to go west. Not south. West. South is no good for us. South is no good. How's west looking? No, no, no, no. West is a no go. Repeat. West is a no go. You should be making visual contact with this horde at any time. That's not a Zunami. That's the end of the world. [electric guitar theme music plays] ♪ Have mercy, ♪ [gunshots] ♪ Oh, have mercy. ♪ Well? If it was a Z, we'd pike it. We're awfully exposed out here. I feel like bait. Those ATVs gonna run? Well, this one's got my name all over it. No way in hell I'm letting you out of my sight. Okay, so there's only room for two more. Somebody's got to hightail it. Me and Doc can make our way to higher ground on foot. But just don't forget to come back and get us when that mega super horde passes. Got it. Looks like you might be getting to ten thousand a lot sooner than you thought. Let's get out of here. [whistling] [gunshot] Hold it right there! This is tribal land! No visitors allowed! Our vehicle broke down a ways back. We were hoping for a little shelter from the horde of zombies that's coming. Can't help you. You got to turn around. Go back the way you came! Yá'át'ééh Yá'át'ééh Listen, sir. I know we're outsiders, and you have no reason to trust or believe us. But you can believe your own eyes. Believe me. It's already over the horizon You have a few hours or less. Come with me. Holy sh1t. [both grunting] [yelling] [grunting] Thanks, kid. Whoa. Check it out. Makes you feel kinda small, don't it? I guess that's why they call it the Grand Canyon. [twig breaking] Zombies? [twig breaking] I think so. Whoa. Doc? [electric zapping] [casino machines beeping] Welcome to Northern Quest Casino Resort. My name is Chief Danny Fire Cloud. Danny? What the hell kind of Indian name is Danny? It's the name on my birth certificate. What's yours? Smith. John Smith. What's wrong with your color? Nothing. What's wrong with your color, Chief? Excuse me, Chief Fire Cloud? Thank you for hearing us out. We actually came here to warn you. That's not just some dust storm out there. This is a solid wall of zombies headed this way. We've dealt with hordes before. I wouldn't be so sure. We've been in contact with Citizen Z. And according to him, this horde is miles deep and it's gonna destroy everything in its path. Our defenses will protect us. Listen. We got some friends still out there. You think they'll be okay As long as they make it to higher ground, they should be fine. Just hope they don't run into my son. Why? What's wrong with your son? Snake eyes. What are you gonna do to us? You'll be treated exactly how you deserve to be. [chanting] What are they saying? Can't make it out. Something in their native tongue. What does zendigo mean? I'll tell you what zendigo means. It's a plague you both carry. White man's disease. I dunno what you're talking about, but I can assure you we both had our shots. Your people infected us before. Zendigo nearly destroyed my people. We vowed never allow that to happen again. I'm only gonna ask you one more time. What are you doing on tribal land? You're trespassing on sacred ground. We didn't know anything about it being sacred anything. We were trying to get away from a zombie mega horde, which is headed straight this way whether you believe us or not. Your trespassing is the only thing that would lead them to us  Lead them to you? Have you seen that massive crowd of brain eating ghouls? Ain't nobody leading that. All we're trying to do is get out of its way. You people should too. Leave our land again? Never. I will die here. This horde is no different than any other that has come before. These creatures aren't interested in our people. They're only after you. They're a manifestation of your disease. You destroy everything you come into contact with. These creatures aren't the plague that can kill us. You are. That's enough! Gordon, you've got to give this zendigo bullshit a rest. You know I don't go by that name anymore. If mom was still alive, she'd smack you upside the head. It's great to tap into our heritage and all, but give me a break. Where are you taking them? To the infirmary. [rumbling] This hurt? Yep. How about this? Even more. Been in a lot of fights, haven't you? You have no idea what a long strange trip it's been. You wouldn't happen to have anything for the pain, would you Pain management happens to be my specialty. Follow me. Thank you for helping us. It's the least I can do. You got to forgive my brother. He doesn't mean to be such a jerk. He's just trying to protect us. He does know the zombie virus affects everyone, right? My brother's no fool. He was a professor for the Native American Studies Department at the University. He thinks that if we can avoid contact with the outside world that eventually the zombies will die off and somebody will synthesize a cure. Yeah, I'm sure somebody will synthesize one eventually. So is this all that's left of your tribe? This is half of our tribe. Gordon, I mean Red Hawk, and my dad don't exactly see eye to eye. My dad was Chief and CEO of the casino. When the apocalypse happened, half of them stayed with my dad while the other half followed my brother up here to where our ancestors first settled. So what does zen... Di... go mean exactly? Zendigo? Right. [laughing] It can mean a lot of things. But it usually refers to the disease of the soul. It's when a person takes without regards to the damage it causes to others. But it really never fills the hole inside of them. You always stare so much? Only when I'm really interested in what somebody's saying. Hey, this is for the dish. This is for the ham radio. Let's go ham. Okay, ham it is. I think it's really cool that you know the voice of the apocalypse. Oh yeah? Oh yeah. We were huge fans of Citizen Z you know before the radio crashed. [static and beeping] Is that Morse Code? Keeps giving the same thing over and over again. CZ. CZ. You think it's him? [growling] It has to be. Can you send back DXD? I don't have... I don't have a code key. Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. Nice. [short bursts of static] [beeping] He heard us. He's saying something new. [beeping continues] Three, four, period, one.  Where did you learn to do this? My grandpa. He was a code talker in World War II. [beeping continues] Does this mean anything to you? Dude. You just helped save the world. [mumbling] Remember before the apocalypse, when all this was illegal. I guess every cloud has a silver lining. The one drug I never tried. So you're a real medicine woman, huh? Same way you're a real doctor. Right on. This stuff is strong, ain't it? Yes. We use it to guide us spiritually. Just some of us. Actually just me. And you hallucinate on this stuff, right? Big time. Good. Cuz right now there's a three foot tall raven right next to you. How's your pain doing? Feeling no pain, doc. In fact, I'm gonna refer all my patients to you. Hey, you wanna see something over here? Are they talking to you too? They always do. That dude is my great great great grandpa. Taklishim. The Grey One. He was a great medicine man. He teaches me something new everyday. [chanting] I don't know how, but I swear I understand every word they're saying. Can't believe my ancestors were such boneheads. I'm really sorry for the way they treated your people. Not your fault. All we have is right here and now. In the end, everything is forgiven. I sure hope you're right. [chanting] [growling] [three gunshots] [growling] Warren : First floor barricades are complete. Anyone else feel like we're trying to plug a hole in the Titanic with toilet paper? Got any better ideas, Murphy? I'd love to hear it. Abandoning ship seems like a pretty good idea to me. To where? We do not have enough gas to get far enough away, and I do not want to get caught out there in the open. These walls are steel reinforced concrete. We're not gonna leave our home. Not again. Hey, kid. I tell you, you got to go talk to their ancestors. I'm telling you, they're some of the coolest people you'll ever meet. What the hell's going on?! You patched them up. Now it's time for them to go. Their presence here puts us all in danger. I'm not about to let that happen. This is as far as we go. Go back to your people. We're free to go? Take yes for an answer, kid. Come on. Woo! Doc! Thanks for volunteering to be our early warning alarm This is crazy! Let us go! You'll never see us again! You got that right. Look. You and I both know what happens if I let you go. You'll find your party and then turn around and come right after me and my family. No, we wouldn't. Yes, you would. And so would I. Besides, if I am wrong, it doesn't really matter. Does it? We're all gonna die anyway. 
 
 [rumbling] I've never seen so many stars, man. What? Doc, it's daytime. Wow, this stuff is stronger than I thought. What is wrong with you? Not a thing, man. In fact, I'm more at peace now than before the whole world turned fubar. I'm getting dizzy. We're gonna need to try to get free before I black out. I am already free. This reality is just a cage of our perception, man. Doc, you're scaring me. It's okay, kid. I'm just creating my own reality here. [growling] Well in your reality, is there a Z headed straight our way? Oh yeah. A butt ugly one too. Doesn't that concern you? Nope. [snarling] This is not how I want to die. It is not our time to die. I think I'm gonna pass out. [growling] [growling] [growling continues] [slice] What was that? Where's the zombie? I'm not exactly sure. But I think I killed it. How? Astral projection. [growling] Could you do it again? [snarling] [snarling continues] I got no idea how I did it the first time. I hate to tell you this, kid. But I think the peyote's wearing off. Hey, you! Ugly! You're slip's showing! [grunting] Doc, what the hell are you doing? Buying you time. Would you shut up? Come on girlfriend, over here! [snarling] [whimpering] I need some z weed. [splorch] What are you? Our guardian angel? Just someone who hates seeing innocent people mistreated. [growling] [screaming] [growling] I don't know how we can ever thank you. I need your help. Name it. Our people at the casino are just as stubborn as Red Hawk. They won't believe me if I tell them what's coming. But they might believe you. Well I'm in. Since when do you know how to ride a horse? I don't. This is my first time. I got some friends telling me what to do. I'll lead. [chanting] [static] I think I got him. Delta X-ray Delta. This is Citizen Z. Do you copy? Delta X-ray Delta. This is Northern Light. Come in, please. Citizen Z, go for Carver. Addy, hey. Listen. Battery's low. Can't talk long. I got a favor to ask. Yeah, what's up? I'm having a hard time killing this one last zombie. Anybody there know how to fire an AT4 anti-tank missile launcher? Hey, CZ. This is Warren. I can talk you through it. Is it in front of you? In my hand. Locate the firing pin assembly cover on the bottom of the tube  opposite of the sight. Don't open it yet. Then you need to arm it Now do you see the locking ring on the front and the back of the tube? Turn those opposite ways. Locked and loaded. How do I fire this thing? Fold up the sight. Slide back the trigger guard till it locks. With the tube on your shoulder, use the sight to aim and pull the trigger. Then watch out. [click] sh1t. It did not fire. Repeat. It did not fire. The battery's just cold. Flip over the firing tube. Open the battery housing. Got it. Now what? You need to put the battery someplace warm. [growling] [growling] Citizen Z? Citizen Z? Dad! What are you doing here? I thought you were with your brother. We came to warn you. I'm well aware of the Derecho. We've withstood many of these storms before. Brother, you got a 10.0 zombie-quake headed your way. Dad, you should listen to them. Quick. Let's go inside. Hey! Doc! 10K! You guys! Well thank God for small favors. Get over here! You made it. Right on. [breathing heavily] Hey, Warren. How hot does this battery got to be? As hot as you can get it. Not hot enough. Oh sh1t. [growling] Come on! [growling] [growling continues] [grunting] Hot enough. [growling] [breathing heavily] [explosion] [static] Zombie down. Repeat. Zombie down. [all cheering] Time to go. Got that right. They're coming. I can feel it. Please, come with us. The cliffs are no safer than here. If we leave now, at least we stand a chance. If you stay Dad, you can still make it to the sacred cliffs. Delta X-ray Delta. This is Citizen Z. Do you copy? If you haven't found cover, then do so now. The first of the fast zombies should be reaching you any minute. Guys Guys Everything we've worked for, it's over. Everyone, it's time for us to go. We need to hurry. They will kill all of you. It's time for you to lead us out of here. I'm not coming. What do you mean? You can't stay here. This is my life here. Your mother and I built this place with our bare hands. Her spirit rests here. This place is sacred too. It is stronger than a million zombies! What if it's not? Then I go down with the ship. Please don't do this. Everyone. It is time for you to go. It has been an honor to serve as your tribal Chief. In my absence, listen to my daughter. She has known you all of her life. And she holds a wisdom that is beyond her years. My girl, this is your time. I love you. From your mother. We love you. [whispering] Now go. We're going to the sacred cliffs. We'll take the vehicles as far as we can take them, then go on foot the rest of the way. Everyone stay together. Take that, you brain eating bastards. Hope you all made it out of there. [rumbling] [laughing] You've got to be kidding me. [rumbling] [rumbling] Oh my God. Let's go. [rumbling] Go take this to your mother. Ayalla! You're safe. What happened? Hello. Welcome. [crying] It's gone! Demolished by zombies! The casino? Father? He wouldn't leave. Stubborn till the end. Just like you! [crying] [crying] You can't be. Not anymore. [crying] You are welcome here. All of you. We should be safe here. We blocked the only narrow passage in. And zombies can't climb. I'm sorry. It's cool, brother. In the end, all is forgiven. I'm sorry, man. [growling] Zombie! [growling] Mercy. [growling] [gunshot] The fast ones. They're starting to arrive. But how did they climb up there? [growling] [growling] [splorch] Blasters! In a few hours, the entire zunami is gonna push over the cliff and into this canyon. What are we gonna do? We got to divert them somehow. We need a plan. [chanting] Hey! You think zombies are as dumb as buffalo? [chanting] [drumming] [fire crackling] [growling] [fire crackling] [fire crackling] ♪ [flare hissing] [fire crackling] ♪ ♪ [growling] [growling] [fire crackling] [growling] [fire crackling] I have to save them! Murphy, no! Turn around! What's he doing?  Trying to save his tribe. Turn around! Murphy. No, you don't understand! They can feel! They can feel! I have to save them! I have to save them! No, Murphy! There's way too many! What the hell are you doing?! There's too many! Come on. There's too many! Look, they're turning! [growling] Let's get to higher ground! ♪ ♪ It worked. And then some. On this day, in generations to come, our people will remember you of the Z Nation, who fought with us here today. They will know who you are and what you did. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. So what are you gonna do? Tough it out? These cliffs are still our home. My people have lived here for thousands of years. It's time to start thinking about the next thousand. More like next week. For your journey to protect you. Come back and see us sometime. I will. Definitely. Here's something, to remember your trip. Awesome. And this is for the road. A trip to remember. Oh and if anybody asks, we were nowhere near the Grand Canyon. Thanks, man. This should help you get started on the new radio. Did I really help save the world? Stay tuned. He's pretty messed up. Give me a minute. You didn't have to kill them. Yes, we did. We did need to kill all those zombies. Everyone we've ever mercied needed killing. Because it's us or them. That's what it's down to. And I choose us. A day is coming when you're gonna have to decide what you are. Human or zombie. And when that day comes, I want you to remember which of the two is trying to keep you alive. And which one wants to eat your brains. Let's go. Let's saddle up.
