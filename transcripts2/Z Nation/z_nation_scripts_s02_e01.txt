 [i] Warren : This man is the only known survivor of a zombie bite.[/] 
 He's our last best hope for humanity. 
 What if I don't want to be your guinea pig? 
 Then you'll wind up like patient zero over there. 
 I've led them into a trap. 
 Kill him. 
 [gunfire] 
 [i] 10K : Doc! 
 Murphy : You set me up you b*st*rd.[/] 
 I had no idea this was gonna happen. 
 You have to believe me. 
 No I don't. 
 I don't have to believe anything anyone says ever again. 
 [i]A tactical nuclear weapon will be launched from NORAD[/] to incinerate the lab. 
 [i](computer voice) Seven minutes to detonation.[/] 
 Doc : Is that all that's left of Murphy? 
 He shed his skin. 
 Holy crap. 
 Look. 
 Lets go. 
 God I hate the Apocalypse.

 This is Citizen Z broadcasting on all frequencies. 
 This is an emergency broadcast. 
 Repeat. This is an emergency broadcast. 
 Literally life and death for the human race. 
 Now there's a man traveling among you. 
 He's the only human known to have survived a zombie bite. 
 His blood has the antibodies to create a vaccine. 
 Now it is imperative that he be transported[i] alive[/] to the Centers for Disease Control Lab in California. 
 [i][crash] 
 [snarling][/] 
 His name is Murphy. Last seen in Fort Collins, Colorado. 
 Six foot two. Dark hair. Numerous bite marks on torso. 
 Known to control zombies. 
 Should be considered armed and dangerous. 
 Keep alive at all costs. Repeat. 
 Keep him alive at all costs. 
 [i][growling][/] 
 The Centers for Disease Control is offering an enormous bounty for Murphy's safe delivery to be paid in whatever form you desire, as well as being first in line for any cure developed. 
 [i][snarling][/] 
 [whispering] If you can hear this broadcast Save humanity. Save yourself. 
 Find Murphy. 
 [snarling] 
 [splorch] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 They're all dead. 
 How? 
 [i]We were on the hill watching the lights. 
 I think those were nukes. 
 That's what I thought. 
 Figured what was left of the world was trying to kill itself. 
 Anyway, the boy they banished because he turned thirteen? 
 He figured it out. 
 Came back. 
 Set the whole place on fire[/] and released the zombie bear. 
 Well sounds like she was right about men. 
 Look, Mack... 
 [i][roaring][/] 
 Bear? 
 [whispering] Yeah.

 Hey, friend.

 You're sure you're not The Murphy? 
 Cuz right now that's the only thing keeping you alive. 
 Show me your bites. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 Your heard me. 
 Lift up your shirt. I need to see those bites. 
 Got to make sure you're the real thing. 
 Those are bites? 
 They were. They're healing nicely, thank you. 
 Okay, so what if I am The Murphy, whatever the hell that means. So what? 
 [laughing] So everybody and their uncle's looking for you. 
 Government is paying a bounty on your ass. 
 [laughs] Look, I got a whole van full of oxy if that's what you want. 
 How 'bout you take half and I'll just be on my way? 
 How 'bout I take the oxy and you to California for that bounty? 
 You're gonna take me to California? 
 By yourself? 
 Damn straight. 
 [laughs] 
 [laughing] Sorry. Sorry. 
 You're insane. 
 [clicking of taser] 
 [moaning] 
 That's right. I'm insane. 
 You're my prisoner. 
 Don't worry Mr. Murphy, I won't kill you. 
 But I will hurt you real bad if I need to. Do you understand me? 
 Do you... 
 [i][stab][/] 
 Cassandra? 
 Oh, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. 
 [hissing] 
 [moans] Oh, okay. 
 Yeah, good to see you too. 
 All right, come on. Let's break it up here. Okay. 
 [stuttering] Bomb Bomb. Bomb, bad. Yeah. 
 Listen. It's not safe here. We need to get out of here, okay? 
 But first, you need a makeover, girl. 
 [growling] 
 No, no. No. 
 No mercy for that one. 
 [growling continues] 
 I got plans for him. Come on. 
 [growling continues] 
 Yeah, well you should've thought about that before you shot those innocent zombies, shouldn't you have? 
 Let me see. 
 Yeah. 
 I told you that white mink would pull it all together, didn't I? 
 Classy. 
 [whispering] Classy. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Come along, mister I'm So Badass. 
 Let's go. 
 [groaning] 
 Okay. Let's get you over here. 
 [groaning] 
 What is it? 
 The bleeding stopped, but Just go. 
 Find me a hole to crawl in. 
 Leave me a weapon and some ammo. 
 Hey. 
 Nobody's leaving you here to die. 
 Here, take the last of the water. 
 Go on. Pretty weak myself. 
 We wait here too long, we might be too weak to go look for help. 
 I've only got a day in me without water, if that. 
 Well I don't think I'm going anywhere, Chief. 
 10K, you stay here with Doc. 
 I'm going to see if I can find food or help while I still got the strength. 
 If I'm not back in 48 hours, you're on your own. 
 Good luck. 
 Thanks.

 Mack : If this works, Warren and the others will be able to see the signal for miles[/] 
 Find something? 
 No. It's just that same recorded broadcast again and again. 
 I hope he's okay up there. 
 [i](different voice on radio) Nine, eight, eight, three, four.[/] 
 Just that same weird numbers station again. 
 You know that's got to be some sort of code. 
 Wonder who needs to keep a secret anymore.

 [whispering] What? 
 Who was that? 
 I don't know, but they were talking about Murphy. 
 It was something in Spanish and I dunno, maybe Mandarin. 
 Do you think that means he's still alive? 
 The question is do we really still care if he's alive? 
 If you don't care if he's still alive, why are you trying to contact Warren and the others, huh? 
 Got nothing else to do, Addy. 
 [grunt] 
 [breathing deeply] 
 [whispering] Come on, Warren. 
 Don't die before you can kill yourself.

 I found this place about a week ago. 
 Looters missed the stash of food and booze in the basement. 
 Guess all the zombies in here kept out the rif-raf. 
 [laughing] Wait 'til I show you what I've been teaching the locals. 
 Cassandra? Hey, where'd you go?

 And even if he did, you're immune. Remember? 
 [whispering] I'm not a zombie. 
 I know. 
 You're better. 
 I've been working on my zombie whispering. 
 Come on. Let me show you. 
 This is Telulah and Gigi. 
 Check this out. 
 Ladies, let's show her what you've been working on.

 Oh, come on.

 Thank you.

 Maybe it's just some giant cosmic bingo game somewhere. 
 It's probably all just canned civil defense broadcasts triggered by the nukes. 
 Wow.

 [i] 10K : Three thousand ninety nine![/] 
 Doc yelling : We saw your signal! 
 Warren : You've made a real life for yourselves here. 
 Have some more goat cheese. 
 My husband's been monitoring the milk for fallout, but so far the winds have spared us. 
 No. Thank you. 
 I've eaten so much already, my body doesn't know what the hell is going on. 
 I haven't had real food for weeks. 
 Gave myself up for dead. 
 We've all been there. 
 [laughs] 
 [laughs] We don't get many visitors. 
 Oh, how 'bout you? How you doing? 
 A lot better. 
 Yeah. 
 Now she knows why we don't go digging for roots[i] alone.[/] 
 There were never zombies there before. 
 It's the damn nukes. 
 Everything's screwed up now. Even the weather. 
 Yeah. 
 Well I have two partners that are still out there, and I should be getting back to them. 
 All right then. 
 I'm gonna pack you some provisions. 
 Thanks. 
 Come here. 
 All right. 
 From what I've heard, everything west of this line here is a no-go zone. And there's more fallout here and over here. 
 And I think that's the tunnel where we crashed. 
 So that would put my friends somewhere in there. 
 Yeah, that's about a two day hike. 
 A little less if you go over the mountain. 
 Got it. 
 [i](girl reading) licking his face and hands. 
 And so, seizing the larger by the ears he jumped on his back.[/] 
 And to my great amusement [i]coolly rode to meet me as I came up the hatchway.[/] 
 Do you have to go? 
 Yeah, sweetie. 
 I have to go. 
 I have a job to do. 
 Come back and tell us how it turns out. 
 Promise? 
 Promise. 
 Good luck with that Murphy fellow. 
 [whispers] Yeah. 
 My husband told me what you did out there. 
 It must have been horrible. 
 I don't know how to thank you. 
 Those kids those beautiful kids. 
 That's how you'll thank me. 
 I was ready to die, and I needed a reason to live. 
 Those kids they're the reason. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck. 
 Got it.

 [motor running] 
 Oh hey! 
 My Spanish is terrible, but I'm sure this is what they were talking about. 
 I wonder who else heard that broadcast. 
 Ten o'clock! 
 I see them. Just keep going! 
 Folks are friendly here in Cheyenne. 
 Friendly ain't the vibe I'm getting. 
 Let's find Murphy and get the hell out of Dodge. 
 Cheyenne. 
 Whatever. 
 Okay so we all need to think like Murphy. 
 Get inside his zombified head. 
 And I know that's a scary place to be. 
 But where would you hide if you were Murphy? 
 Hey, hold on! 
 You say think like Murphy? 
 Hell, they might as well have his picture on the sign. 
 Hey, guys. 
 What the hell took you so long? 
 Murphy, you son of a bitch. 
 Yeah, what she said. 
 Now, now, Roberta. Is that any way to talk to an old friend? 
 [crash] 
 [snarling] 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 [snarling ceases] 
 That hurt. 
 Oh. 
 I'm just getting started. 
 Now come on, Chief. Hey. Don't forget the mission. 
 Come on. 
 You damn near got us killed. 
 And you did kill millions of other people. 
 Didn't you get the memo? 
 The Apocalypse means never having to say you're sorry. 
 I was just following the prime directive of this mission. 
 Save Murphy's ass. 
 Let's not forget. 
 If I die, party's over for the human race. 
 If you want to blame somebody, blame that nutjob Doctor Kurian. 
 Or your little buddy Citizen Z. 
 Maybe we should tie you up for your own good. 
 [hissing] 
 Cassandra. 
 [hissing] 
 You're alive. 
 [hissing] 
 Cassandra? 
 What did you do to her? 
 Saved her life. What did you do? 
 [hissing] 
 I'm sorry. What is she wearing? 
 Is that mildly impractical for the Apocalypse? 
 You try dressing a classy lady in Cheyenne, Wyoming. 
 Hey, is anybody else concerned that there's all these Zs standing around here? 
 Don't worry. They're friendly. 
 As long as I'm friendly. 
 Come on, Murphy. We got to get you to California. 
 Yeah. About California You know after everything that happened, the nukes and all I'm not so sure I'm down with the whole saving humanity thing. 
 I'm not so sure humanity is worth saving. 
 You're going to California. 
 You don't even know if California is still there. 
 Well look if you won't do it for humanity, do it for yourself, Murphy. 
 You need that vaccine more than anybody. 
 Have you looked in the mirror lately? 
 You may be styling, but you're turning zombie, brother. 
 Brother Maybe there are worse things than being a zombie. 
 Maybe being a starving fearful violent vindictive human is worse. 
 But hey! It is the Apocalypse! 
 Let's have some fun! 
 Let me show you what I've been working on. 
 Come on. Grab a seat. You're gonna love this. 
 The Apocalypse will still be waiting for us when we're done. 
 Cassandra!

 Well he's my prisoner now. 
 Uh no. Sorry. She's right. We got dibs on him. 
 Yeah. And we're taking him to California. 
 No, you're not. 
 He's coming with me. 
 Where? 
 To the highest bidder. 
 CDC in California aren't the only ones willing to pay for his blood. 
 Why does everybody always talk about me like I am not standing right here? 
 You know there's only one problem with all of your plans for The Murphy. 
 I ain't going anywhere with any of you.
