 This is Citizen Z. 
 There is a man traveling among you. His name is Murphy. Your name wouldn't happen to be Murphy, would it? His blood has the antibodies to create a vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control is offering an enormous bounty for Murphy's safe delivery. Keep alive at all costs. Repeat. Keep him alive at all costs. Well what do we do now Chief? We are going to find Murphy, get him to California, and they are going to make a vaccine and save the world. And I'm gonna kill any bounty hunter that gets in my way.
