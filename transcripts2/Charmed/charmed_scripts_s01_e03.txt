 [Scene: Outside the manor. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are walking down the stairs heading towards the house across the street.] 
 Prue: So, we're agreed? Twenty minutes? 
 Piper: Prue, you can't do a party in twenty minutes. 
 Prue: Watch me. 
 Phoebe: Prue's party tips - meet, greet and bail. 
 Prue: Hey, I'm sorry but some of us have a job. 
 Phoebe: And some of us have fun. 
 Piper: And some of us are having a really bad hair day. 
 Prue: You know, that is a sign. Let's turn back now before it's too late. 
 Piper: No. 
 Phoebe: Prue, it's never too late for a party. 
 Piper: It's never too late, Prue. 
 Phoebe: Remember my sweet sixteen? (You see a dog in the bushes. They walk across the street and into Fritz, Marshall and Cynda's house.) Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we throw a party and charge commission. It's a great way to make extra cash. 
 Prue: Hey, I have an even better idea. Why don't you just get a job. 
 Marshall: The sisters Halliwell. Now the party can begin. 
 Cynda: It's about time you chicks showed. 
 Fritz: Hey, Prue, I'm glad you made it. 
 Prue: Wouldn't miss it for the world, Fritz. 
 Piper: Marshall, the place looks great. 
 Marshall: Thank you. We're mostly just restoring it. I didn't wanna change it too much. You guys knew the old owners didn't you? 
 Phoebe: Oh, we basically grew up with their kids. We probably know the house better than you guys. 
 Marshall: (to Fritz) Oh, hey, how's the bar? 
 Fritz: Oh, dry. I'll take care of it. 
 Cynda: No, my turn. 
 (Cynda crushes a beer can with her bare hands. Cynda walks away.) 
 Marshall: Try to behave, Cynda. We have guests. 
 Fritz: You know... sisters. 
 Prue: Tell me about it. 
 (Piper and Phoebe look at her.) 
 Marshall: So listen, enjoy the party. 
 Phoebe: Okay. 
 (Fritz and Marshall walk away.) 
 Prue: Okay, I came, I saw, I was perky. Now I just want my head on a pillow because I have to wake up early. 
 Phoebe: No. I mean, not yet. 
 Piper: Yeah, Prue, we just got here. It, it wouldn't look good. 
 Prue: Alright, what's going on? 
 Phoebe: Going on? What do you mean? (Phoebe sees Andy.) Oh, what a coinkidink. Look, who's here. 
 (Prue looks over at Andy. He waves.) 
 Prue: Phoebe, you didn't. 
 Phoebe: Well, your fingers weren't doing the walking, somebody's had to. 
 Prue: We've been through this. Okay, cop, witch, is not a love connection. 
 Phoebe: Boy, girl, lighten up. 
 (Andy comes over to Prue.) 
 Piper: Hi, Andy. 
 (Piper and Phoebe walk away.) 
 Prue: We're working on their subtlety. 
 Andy: Then it's onto ending hunger and creating world peace, right? 
 Prue: Hmm, what will I do with my Saturdays? 
 Andy: Funny you should ask. I don't mean to push you but I was wondering if you're not doing anything, I kind of have these tickets but they're for a Warriors game and you probably wouldn't be interested, so... 
 Prue: Well, the team can't do any worse than they did last year. Did you see him get creamed by the Lakers? 
 Andy: Impressive. Is that a yes? 
 Prue: You know, um, I need to check my book because I might have a thing. 
 Andy: A thing? 
 (Fritz walks up to them.) 
 Fritz: So Prue, I hear you're friends with a cop. 
 Prue: Inspector actually. 
 Fritz: Oh, yeah. I've got these parking tickets. 
 Andy: My focus is mainly homicide and robbery. 
 Fritz: Yeah, yeah. So I have these parking tickets... 
 Prue: Gotta go. 
 (Prue walks away.) 
 Andy: Prue, wait. 
 [Cut to outside. Prue walks back over to the manor. She notices the door's open.] 
 Prue: Phoebe. 
 (She walks inside and shuts the door. There's a dog on the stairs and it starts barking at her. She runs back outside. The dog's eyes glow.) 
 Opening Credits 
 [Scene: Manor. Kitchen. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are there.] 
 Phoebe: How big was this dog again? 
 Prue: Huge. Did you see the scratches on the attic door? 
 Piper: What was it doing in the house? 
 Prue: I don't know. Someone obviously left the front door open again. 
 Phoebe: Why do you always assume it was me? What about Piper? 
 Piper: Not it. 
 Phoebe: Well, it's not a big deal. We checked the house and nothing is missing except my Pat Boone Christmas CD. 
 Piper: Now this is really creepy. If there were a dog in the house, then it had to have an owner. No dog I know can open that front door, let alone reach the top shelf. 
 Phoebe: Hey, maybe we should get a security system. 
 Prue: No, they are way too expensive. Besides after what happened, Andy will be checking in every five minutes. 
 Piper: Oh, you told him. 
 Phoebe: Convenient. So what should we do? 
 Prue: Well, either we could rely on our vicious guard cat to protect us or we could remember to lock the doors. 
 (Prue walks in the laundry.) 
 Phoebe: That is a really good idea, Prue. 
 (Phoebe walks over and locks the door. Prue wiggles the door handle. Piper and Phoebe laugh.) 
 Prue: Unlock the door, Phoebe. 
 [Scene: Bucklands. Prue's office. Prue's sitting at her desk writing on a notepad. Victor walks in. He clears his throat. Prue looks up.] 
 Victor: I was told that you might be able to help me. (He pulls a ring off his finger.) I'd like to have this (he puts it on the desk) appraised. 
 Prue: Well, you would be better off going to the ------- appraiser. 
 Victor: I've been there. He'd need a week. And I just... I wouldn't feel right without it. It's a family heirloom. 
 (She picks it up and looks at it.) 
 Prue: I think I've seen a ring similar to this before. The setting's quite old. At least 17th century. (She walks over to a shelf and picks up a book.) The stones looks like crystallite. Keep in mind this is just an educated guess. 
 Victor: Please, (he sits down) guess away. 
 Prue: I am not mistaken. It's a stone that the Egyptians believed would protect them against spells, curses, evil spirits. This wouldn't be a wedding band by any chance would it? 
 Victor: You tell me. 
 Prue: The stones are set in two's. The symbol of twoality. Man, woman. Like in protection. 
 Victor: And what does all that tell you? 
 Prue: Where did you get this ring? What did you say your name was? 
 Victor: I think you know what my name is... Prudence. 
 Prue: Get out, (she throws the ring on the table and stands up) and stay away from us. 
 (He puts on the ring.) 
 Victor: I'm staying at the Ballmark. What do you say you and your sisters join me for dinner? Let's say tomorrow night. We can talk. 
 Prue: After how you abandoned us? How dare you. 
 Victor: Fiery temper. I like that. It reminds me of someone I know. 
 Prue: I am nothing like you. I would never leave my responsibilities, my family. 
 Victor: I can see we have some issues to work through. 
 Prue: Oh, we've got the whole subscription. Now get out before I have you thrown out. 
 Victor: Is that anyway to talk to your father? 
 (He leaves.) 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: At a cafe. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are sitting at a table drinking coffee.] 
 Piper: I wonder why he went to you first? Why not Phoebe or me? 
 Prue: Piper, it's not like I won the lottery. 
 Phoebe: What was he like? Did he ask about us? 
 Prue: Actually, no. (Phoebe looks upset.) Phoebe, think about it. He abandoned us. He was a no show for twenty years and then what, suddenly here he is? Why now? 
 Piper: Maybe he just wants to be part of our lives. 
 Prue: After all this time? Don't get your hopes up. 
 Phoebe: Well, there's only one way to find out. Why wait till dinner? Let's go see him now. 
 Prue: Will you be rational. Don't you find it just a little suspicious that just when we find out... 
 (a waitress comes up to the table and picks up the dirty plates.) 
 Waitress: Let me get that for you. 
 (She walks away.) 
 Prue: Just when we find out we're witches he shows up. But when mum dies he's no where to be found. 
 Phoebe: He sent us birthday cards. 
 Prue: Selective memory. Grams always told us he was a threat to us. There's no reason to think that's changed. 
 Piper: Prue, it's not that I don't see your point but you knew him, we didn't. Why can't we have a chance to know now? 
 Prue: Because we really don't know why he's here and until we do we can't trust him. 
 [Scene: A hotel. Phoebe knocks on the door to Victor's room.] 
 Victor: Entrée. 
 (Phoebe opens the door and walks in. She walks down all hallway and into a room. She sees Victor getting a massage.) 
 Phoebe: Daddy? 
 Victor: Well, well. What a nice surprise. 
 (He stands up.) 
 Phoebe: I'm, uh, I'm sorry to just show up like this. I know I was supposed to wait for dinner but I... 
 Victor: No, nonsense. Welcome. Let me get a good look at you. This is my baby girl. Little... Piper? (Phoebe looks crushed.) Phoebe. 
 Phoebe: Yeah. That's okay. People confuse us all the time. 
 Victor: Are you kidding? I should be slapped and persecuted. Let me make it up to you. How about some room service? 
 (He heads towards the phone.) 
 Phoebe: I just ate actually. 
 Victor: A drink? You are legal, right? 
 Phoebe: Barely but no thanks. 
 Victor: A massage? I can call Lucy back. 
 Phoebe: No, really, I don't want anything. I just wanted to look at you. 
 Victor: It's like looking in the mirror isn't it? You've got you daddy's eyes, you know that? 
 Phoebe: I noticed that. 
 Victor: How about a hug? (They hug and Phoebe gets a premonition of Victor holding the Book Of Shadows. The premonition ends. The phone rings and they stop hugging.) They always manage to find me. 
 Phoebe: You know what? It's okay, I, I'll just see you at dinner, I've gotta go. 
 (Phoebe leaves.) 
 Victor: Phoebe. Phoebe, wait. 
 [Scene: Outside the manor. A mailman walks up the stairs to the front door. His index finger turns into a key, he unlocks the door and walks inside. He walks up the stairs and up to the attic. The attic door is locked so he breaks it down. He grabs the Book Of Shadows and runs back down the stairs. When he walks through the doorway, the book flies out of his hands. He picks it back up but it doesn't let him take it outside. He sees Prue coming up the stairs so he quickly closes the door and he throws the book in the living room. He shape shifts into Andy. Prue walks in.] 
 Prue: Andy, what are you doing in here? 
 Andy: Uh, door was open. 
 Prue: Again? 
 Andy: Yeah, I, uh, came by to check up and it was open. I looked around. Everything seems to be in order. (Prue sees the Book Of Shadows on the floor in the living room.) You want me to check upstairs? 
 Prue: Uh, no, no, no, that's okay really. (She uses her power and the book slides under a stand.) Oh, and, um, about tomorrow night, I've changed my mind. 
 Andy: Excuse me? 
 Prue: Well, you'll never believe who popped back into my life after twenty years. Victor, my dad. 
 Andy: Your dad? 
 Prue: Yeah, he wants to have dinner and I would really rather avoid that. Too bad the game's not tonight. (Cynda knocks on the door.) Uh, hi Cynda. 
 Cynda: Hey. Everything okay? 
 Prue: Yeah, thanks. 
 Cynda: Bye. 
 Prue: Nice party last night. 
 (Cynda leaves.) 
 Andy: I guess I'll get going too. 
 (He kisses her on the cheek and leaves. Prue locks the door. She walks over, picks up the Book Of Shadows and takes it back upstairs. She notices the broken door.) 
 Prue: What the hell? 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Manor. Kitchen. Prue, Piper and Phoebe's there. Phoebe sits down at the table. Prue and Piper are looking through the drawers.] 
 Phoebe: You don't know for sure. 
 Prue: I know plenty. First someone rips off the attic door, then the Book Of Shadows is found downstairs. Isn't that enough? 
 (Piper gets a phone book out of a drawer.) 
 Piper: Why would somebody want the book? Here. 
 (She hands the phone book to Prue and they both sit down at the table.) 
 Prue: Well, for one reason, they know what it can do. They want its power, our power. 
 Piper: That would mean it's someone who knows us and knows that we're witches. 
 Prue: Yeah, someone like Victor. 
 Phoebe: What? Dad? 
 Prue: Look, just think about it. The moment he shows up someone makes two attempts to grab the book. Coincidence? I think not. 
 Piper: The craft is a chick thing, Prue. It's passed on down through the female line. There's a good chance dad doesn't even know we're charmed. 
 Prue: And there's as good of a chance he does. 
 (Phoebe remembers the premonition she had.) 
 Piper: What would he want with the book? And why would he take it from us? Phoebe, help me out here. Phoebe. 
 Phoebe: Okay. Let's just say for the sake of argument that he is after the it. Wouldn't he of taken it with him? He wouldn't of left it behind. 
 Piper: Okay, we have to call the cops and report it as break in. 
 Prue: And tell them what? That someone broke into our house to try steal our broomsticks? I mean, please. Besides, Andy's already been here. 
 Phoebe: Oh, so Andy was here again. Talk about convenient. Did you ever think about pointing the finger at him? 
 Prue: He's probably the one who scared Victor away. Until we find out what's going on and whether Victor's involved or not, we've got to hide the book. Either that or we can't leave the house. 
 Piper: Fine. Then we hide the book because I'm going to dinner tonight. I wanna see dad. 
 Phoebe: So do I. 
 Prue: I've already seen him. 
 [Scene: Restaurant. Piper, Phoebe and Victor are sitting at a table. Piper's nibbling on a carrot stick.] 
 Victor: Girls, it's so nice to see you. It's not like we don't have a lot to talk about. 
 Phoebe: We do. I mean, yeah, we have a few questions. 
 Victor: (to Piper) You know, the last time we ate dinner together, you would only eat food that was white. I'm glad to see you've out grown it. 
 Piper: That's right. I was four. 
 Victor: Phoebe, that would've made you what? One? (She nods.) You know, you couldn't walk yet but you could swim. You were a fish. (Phoebe laughs.) This feels right doesn't it? This feels natural, almost like normal. 
 Piper: Almost. It's just, um, well, why? I mean, after all this time, why here, why now? 
 Victor: Well, I heard the food is pretty good here and it is dinner time. 
 (Phoebe laughs. The waiter places a plate in front of Phoebe.) 
 Waiter: Here you are, ma'am. 
 Phoebe: Thank you. 
 Victor: Bon appetite. 
 [Scene: Manor. Kitchen. Prue takes a container of broccoli out of the microwave and pours them out onto a plate. The door bell rings.] 
 [Cut to the foyer. Prue walks in and opens the door. Andy's there.] 
 Andy: My plans for tonight fell through, figured I'd stop by. 
 (Prue opens the door wider and Andy walks in.) 
 [Time lapse. In the kitchen. Andy's sitting at the table. Prue carries two cups of coffee over to the table.] 
 Prue: And then all of a sudden there he was. He just showed up at work. 
 Andy: I can't believe it. How are you dealing? 
 Prue: Honestly, I'm not. 
 (She sits down.) 
 Andy: I don't blame you. What do you think he wants? 
 Prue: Dinner. Piper and Phoebe are there with him now. You know, they just don't understand. They don't know him like I do. I can't believe I let them go. I can't believe they went. He's acting like no time has passed, like I'm still his little girl and I'm not. There are things I want to tell him, I want him to know what he missed. You know, like the time I broke my arm or the day that I finally passed my drivers test, our prom. 
 Andy: Didn't we miss that too? 
 (They smile.) 
 Prue: I want him to know. I want him to want to know. And I'm sorry but I also want some answers, like where the hell's he been all my life. Why didn't he come back until now? He needs to know that that's not okay. 
 Andy: So tell him. I'll drop him off. 
 [Scene: Restaurant. Prue walks in and goes up to the table. Victor stands up.] 
 Victor: Prudence. 
 Prue: Did I miss much? 
 Phoebe: Uh, just catch up. Dad was filling us in. Memory lane. 
 Prue: Has he mentioned where he's been all our lives? 
 Piper: Prue... 
 Prue: I don't understand. If you can afford a spot like this, why didn't you help out when Grams died? We actually could've used it then. 
 Piper: Give him a chance, Prue. Dad's explained. The money, all this, it's new. 
 Victor: It's okay, Piper. I'm a big boy. I didn't come back earlier because I was afraid I might disappoint you. 
 Prue: Too late. 
 Piper: I wonder what's keeping that dessert? 
 Victor: Please, sit down. Have something to eat. 
 Prue: I'm not hungry. 
 Victor: Always in a hurry, Prue. You skipped crawling and went straight to walking. 
 Prue: Ah, we're sharing memories. Well, I got one of my own, you're back walking out the door. 
 (Just as a waiter walks past them holding a flambeau, Victor puts out his foot and trips him. Piper freezes him and the restaurant. She gets up and takes the flambeau out of the waiters hands. Everyone unfreezes and the waiter falls flat on his face.) 
 Piper: Who wants flambeau? 
 (The waiter stands back up and takes the flambeau off of Piper.) 
 Victor: Nice reflexes. Now let me get this straight. Piper, you freeze time. Prue, don't you move objects? And what's you specialty, Phoebe? Premonitions? Maybe we should talk about this elsewhere. 
 [Scene: Manor. Living room. Piper and Phoebe are sitting on the couch reading magazines. The mail man walks in. Piper jumps up.] 
 Piper: What are you doing here? 
 Mail Man: What do ya think? 
 (Phoebe jumps up.) 
 Phoebe: Get out now. 
 Mail Man: No, you've gotta get out. 
 Phoebe: We've got it under control. 
 Mail Man: No you don't because they're on their way back. (The mail man shape shifts into Fritz.) I thought you were in charge. Look, shape shift into yourself and we'll get back to the book later. (Phoebe shape shifts into Marshall.) Nice plan, Marshall. 
 Marshall: Don't piss me off, Fritz. (Piper shape shifts into Cynda.) How was I supposed to know Prue would come back with her sisters. 
 Cynda: That little witch was supposed to be out on a date with that cop. 
 Fritz: You really think you would've been able to trick Prue into getting the book out of the house? 
 Marshall: Well, we sure as hell can't now can we? 
 Fritz: So what now, genius? 
 (Cynda laughs and then turns into a demon-like creature.) 
 Cynda: We kill them. 
 [Cut to outside. Prue, Piper, Phoebe and Victor pull up.] 
 [Cut back inside.] 
 Marshall: Cynda, heal. Plenty of time for that later. Heal. 
 [Cut back outside. Prue unlocks the door. When she opens it she sees three crows inside. They squawk and fly outside.] 
 Victor: Friends of yours? 
 Commercial Break 
 
 
 
 [Scene: Manor. Living room. Phoebe, Piper and Victor are there laughing. Prue walks in.] 
 Prue: Someone left the window open which is probably how the birds got in. What is so funny? 
 Piper: Do you remember the day this was taken? 
 (Piper shows her a photograph.) 
 Prue: Yeah, family picnic. It rained. 
 Victor: And your mother packed us all up and she brought us home and we had the picnic right here in the living room. Do you remember that Prue? 
 Prue: Barely. 
 Phoebe: Prue... 
 (Victor picks up another photograph and slowly walks over to Prue.) 
 Victor: This one was at one of your piano recitals. Not a very good shot. My fault. I had to take the pictures that day. Your mother was too busy holding her breath. If you look closely, (he hands her the photo) you see there, that's her. 
 Prue: I never noticed that before. 
 (Victor picks up another photo.) 
 Victor: And this one used to be a five by seven. (It is a picture of the family but a piece is missing.) When I was still in it. 
 Phoebe: I think Grams cut you out. 
 Piper: There's a bunch of other stuff in the attic. Grams left us some things. 
 Phoebe: Not all she left us. 
 Prue: Phoebe, let's not go there. 
 Phoebe: What, it's not like he doesn't already know and I'm sorry but it's kind of a relief to talk to someone about it. 
 Piper: Um, does anybody want coffee? 
 Phoebe: I mean, one day I am a member of the Y generation with average hair and a thing for caffeinated beverages, and the next I am a witch. 
 Piper: Dad, do you take cream or, um, sugar with that? 
 Phoebe: I just read from the book and 'wham!' I am Tabitha. The only thing is, is I got stuck with the power to see the future. How uncool is that? 
 Victor: Well, from what your mother always said, it was actually considered one of the more desirable powers. 
 Phoebe: Unless you see things you don't desire. 
 Prue: So how long have you known? About us, our powers, how long? 
 Victor: I knew there was a possibility. That's why I came back, to find out. It must of happened when your grandmother died, right? 
 Phoebe: Yep, I just read an incantation from the book and... 
 Prue: Phoebe. 
 Victor: Ahh, the Book Of Shadows. Not exactly summer reading. Is it still up in the attic? You know, I haven't seen it in years. Mind if I have a look? 
 [Cut to Fritz, Marshall and Cynda's house. Cynda is hitting a chair against the wall.] 
 Cynda: Disappointed. 
 Marshall: Patience, my sweet. 
 Cynda: Patience is highly over rated. We could've destroyed them right there. 
 Marshall: Then we'd have three dead witches and no way to get the book out of the house. Where would that put us? 
 Cynda: Satisfied. 
 Fritz: I still like my idea. We just kill two of them and we force the third to get the book out. 
 Marshall: Let me explain this once again for the cerebrally impaired. These are not school girls we're dealing with. These are good witches. We can not alert them with our presence. At their full strength, battling them would be unpleasant. However, once we possess the book, we get its powers, we weaken theirs and they're easy pray. 
 Fritz: You know, that sounds good in theory but, um, (he raises his voice) we've already tried everything. 
 Marshall: We still have Victor. 
 [Cut back to the manor.] 
 Victor: What exactly are you accusing me of, Prue? 
 Prue: Figure it out. 
 Phoebe: Come on, Prue, take it easy. 
 Prue: Are you kidding me? Am I the only one who sees what's going on here? 
 Piper: Couldn't we all just take a deep breath... 
 Prue: Think about it, Piper. He wines and dines and now he's back in the house he hasn't set foot in for twenty years and the first thing he wants to know is where's the Book Of Shadows? 
 Phoebe: You're just looking for something to blame him for. 
 Prue: Admit it. Tell them why you're here. 
 Piper: Prue, stop. 
 Prue: For the first time in your life, Victor, tell them the truth. 
 Victor: Alright, fine. You're right. I am after the book. That's exactly the reason why I came back. 
 Phoebe: Dad. 
 Victor: But not for the reasons you would like to believe. It would make it easier for you, Prue, wouldn't it? If I were evil. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, I'm not. I'm here to protect you. 
 Prue: Yeah, right. 
 Piper: To protect us from what? 
 Victor: From yourselves. That's why I want that damn book. It's where the power of three started and it's where it must end. 
 Phoebe: It's part of us, it's part of who we are. 
 Victor: That's what your mother believed too. Before they killed her. 
 Piper: What are you saying? 
 Victor: You have no idea what evil is out there. 
 Prue: Oh, I think we've got a pretty good idea. 
 Victor: Listen to me, Prue. That book is a magnet for evil. As long as you have it, as long as you use it, you're in danger. All of you. 
 Prue: You're unbelievable. After all these years of being an absentee dad then you waltz back into our lives and tell us how to live. 
 Victor: I never wanted you to have those powers in the first place. I battled with your grandmother after your mum died. She wanted you to find out you were witches when you grew up. I didn't. I fought for you, hard. Your grandmother was too strong. 
 Piper: Wait, you're blaming Grams for why you disappeared. She loved us, she raised us. 
 Prue: What'd she do? Put a spell on you? 
 Victor: believe me, nothing short of that would've kept me away. You have to believe me. All I want is for what's best for you. Phoebe, you believe me don't you? 
 Prue: We've done fine without you. 
 Victor: Prue, you can't fight this. I couldn't. 
 Prue: I'm not you. 
 Victor: Are you sure? Are you sure you can protect your sisters forever? 
 Piper: We'll protect each other. 
 Victor: Then you'll die together. 
 Prue: No one can hurt us as bad as you. 
 (She uses her power and he flies across the room and he hits the door frame. He stands back.) 
 Victor: If you wanted me to leave, all you had to do was ask. 
 (He leaves.) 
 Phoebe: Why did you have to do that? 
 (Phoebe follows Victor outside.) 
 Piper: Did you have to throw him so hard? 
 Prue: Piper... 
 Piper: We could've just, you know, talked about it like normal people. 
 Prue: We're not normal. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Hotel. Victor's room. Victor walks in and sits on the couch. The light turns on and Fritz, Marshall and Cynda are standing there.] 
 Marshall: Hell, Victor. Where have you been? 
 Victor: How did you get in here? 
 Marshall: I think you should be a little more concerned with what we're doing in here. 
 Victor: I was wondering when evil would rear its ugly head. 
 Marshall: Consider it reared. I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with but ---- they aren't willing to rip you into a thousand pieces and dance on your entrails. 
 Victor: Ahh, so you're lawyers. And here I was assuming you were shape shifters. 
 Fritz: Those are clever words for a man about to be an appetizer. 
 Victor: Cocky words for a man who can't get a simple book out of a house. Close your mouth. I mean, it's obvious. You're gonna shape shift into me and try to get to the girls that way. Am I right? It won't work. 
 Cynda: Why not? 
 Victor: (to Marshall) You mind if I poke holes? 
 Marshall: Poke away. 
 Victor: After tonight, the girls won't let me or anything that looks like me back into their lives let alone the house. I have officially been kicked out. There is however, one sister I can reach. Phoebe. 
 Cynda: So why don't I just become you and I'll reach her. 
 Victor: Because only her real father would know what buttons to push. The ones that would get me back in. If you kill me, you'll never know what they are. You'll never get back into the house and you'll never get the Book Of Shadows. 
 [Scene: Manor. Dining room. Piper and Prue are sitting at the table looking depressed. Prue's moving her food around the plate with her fork. Phoebe walks in.] 
 Phoebe: Good morning, Phoebe. (They ignore her. She picks up a napkin and waves it around.) Uh, guys. Can we call it truce just for five minutes please? I have a confession. Remember when we agreed to not see dad? Yeah, well, I did. 
 Piper: Hello, I was with you. 
 Phoebe: No, by myself before dinner and I had a premonition about dad when he hugged me. He was stealing the Book Of Shadows. Yeah, you were right about him, Prue. I didn't want the premonition to be true. I was hoping, praying that there was a perfectly good explanation for it. Hoping that, that he was really here to be with us. I just wanted him back in our lives. His our dad. 
 (Prue stands up.) 
 Prue: I know, Phoebe. 
 (Prue hugs her. Piper notices something on the floor. She walks over and bends down.) 
 Piper: Hey, look. (She picks up Victor's ring.) Dad's ring. What's it doing here? 
 (She hands it to Prue.) 
 Phoebe: It must of came off when he, uh... fell. 
 Prue: Well, I'll take it back to the hotel. 
 (She puts it on the table.) 
 [Time lapse. Outside. Phoebe picks up the paper. She waves at Fritz and Marshall across the road who are leaning against their car. Victor stands behind Phoebe. Phoebe turns around and gasps.] 
 Victor: Don't be afraid. 
 Phoebe: What are you... you have to leave. 
 Victor: Phoebe, please, this is very important. 
 Phoebe: I can't. I don't wanna talk to you anymore. 
 Victor: Phoebe, you gotta get the book out of the house. 
 Phoebe: You have to leave. 
 (She tries to walk away but he grabs her arms.) 
 Victor: Phoebe, trust me. Look... 
 (Phoebe has the same premonition as before again but this time Victor shape shifts into Marshall. Marshall, Fritz and Cynda walk off with the book. The premonition ends. Marshall and Fritz walk over to them. Victor lets go of Phoebe.) 
 Marshall: Excuse me, hey. Is this guy bothering you? 
 Phoebe: Uh, no. This is my, uh... this is Victor. 
 Victor: We were just saying goodbye. 
 Phoebe: Yeah, I gotta run. 
 (Phoebe goes back inside.) 
 Victor: What's the matter? Don't you trust me? 
 [Cut to inside. Phoebe runs inside heading towards the stairs. Prue comes in.] 
 Phoebe: Dad's not after the book, it's Marshall. 
 Prue: What? 
 Phoebe: My premonition, it wasn't dad. Gotta find a spell and banish them. 
 Prue: Banish who? 
 Phoebe: The neighbours. They're shape shifters. Fritz and Marshall and the... 
 (Piper and Cynda walk in.) 
 Cynda: Cookies. Just baked. 
 (Fritz walks in.) 
 Fritz: Hey, door was unlocked. 
 (Phoebe starts walking up the stairs.) 
 Piper: We're you going, Pheebs? 
 Phoebe: Uh, just to get something. Will you save me a cookie? (Cynda smiles.) Okay. 
 (Phoebe goes upstairs. Victor walks in.) 
 Victor: Daddy's home. 
 [Cut to the attic. Phoebe runs over to a closet. She pulls the clothes across and the book is in there. She flips the pages.] 
 Phoebe: Come on, come on. I have no idea what I'm looking for. (The pages turn by themselves.) Okay, I can take a hint. (It stops at a page.) "When in the circle that is home, safety's gone and evils roam, rid all beings from these walls, save sisters three now heed our call." (She repeats it and runs downstairs.) Dad, you can't be here, you have to leave now. 
 (Another Victor walks in.) 
 Piper: Whoa, time out. What's going on here? 
 Victor #1: Don't worry about it, sweetie. Everything's gonna be fine. 
 Victor #2: Don't trust him. 
 Piper: Wait a second. Last week we had no dad and now we have two? 
 Victor #1: Phoebe, remember, remember when you were little and you were afraid of the dark and I would leave the hall light on and the door open just a crack. 
 Victor #2: Oh, that's original. What kid isn't afraid of the dark? 
 Victor #1: Prue, she's never afraid of anything. 
 Piper: He's right, Prue. You were never afraid of the dark. 
 Victor #2: Lucky guess. I said I came back to protect you. Now there's only one way to do it. Kill us both. 
 Victor #1: You're bluffing. 
 Victor #2: Am I? Just do it because I wanna go out with a bang. 
 Prue: Do it, Phoebe. 
 Phoebe: The spell will kill everyone including dad. 
 Victor #2: It's the only way. Prudence... 
 Piper: Prue, the protection ring. 
 (Prue uses her power and the ring slides across the table. Victor #2 picks it up. Prue nods and he puts it on.) 
 Prue: Phoebe, now. 
 Phoebe: "In the circle that is home, safety's gone and evils roam, (Cynda turns into a creature) rid all beings from these walls, save sisters three now heed our call." (It gets windy.) "When in the circle that is home, safety's gone and evils roam..." (The shape shifters start melting. Victor #2 falls to his knees. He looks like he's in pain.) Daddy! 
 Victor #2: It's okay, keep it going. 
 Prue, Piper, Phoebe: "Rid all beings from these walls, save sisters three now heed our call." 
 (The shape shifters melt and disappear. Prue, Piper and Phoebe run over to Victor. Prue helps him up.) 
 Victor: For a moment there I wasn't sure what you would do. 
 Prue: For a moment there neither did I. 
 Phoebe: I thought you didn't want us to use our magic. 
 Victor: I didn't. Not as long as I still thought of you as my little girls. But you're obviously not anymore. 
 Piper: We're still you're little girls, we're just... 
 Prue: Witches. 
 Victor: Yeah, witches. Well, obviously you don't need your old man to protect you from anything. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Manor. Living room. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are there. Prue's on the phone.] 
 Prue: No, Andy, I'm fine really. Dad's gonna be here any minute, so can I take a rain check on dinner? Okay, thanks for the good advice. 
 (She hangs up.) 
 Phoebe: So he's dad now? 
 Prue: Yes, Phoebe, and by the way my dress looks good on you. 
 Phoebe: I don't have any nice clothes, Prue. 
 Prue: Dad said it was casual. 
 Phoebe: I don't care. I wanna look nice for him. Who knows how long it'll be before we see him again. 
 Piper: You don't think he's gonna stay around? 
 Phoebe: Well, let's just say I no longer have a romanticised image of him. And I'm glad about that actually. At least dad is real now. 
 Prue: And at least he's not a monster which is very reassuring considering we share his genes. 
 Piper: I'm just glad he came back no matter how long he stays. Kind of nice feeling like a normal family again. Whatever that means. (Phoebe nods. The doorbell rings.) Speak of the devil. 
 (Piper answers the door. Piper and Leo walk back in the living room.) 
 Prue: Uh, hi, you must be Mr. Wyatt. 
 Phoebe: The handyman? 
 Leo: Call me Leo. 
 Phoebe: Gladly. 
 Leo: This was on the steps. (He holds up a yellow large envelope. Prue takes it off him.) This place is, uh, you don't find many like this around anymore. 
 Piper: Yeah, it's kind of falling apart. 
 (Prue opens the envelope.) 
 Leo: The problem isn't the manor, it's the manner in which it was treated. I'd love to see more. 
 Phoebe: I would love to show it to you. The attic is right this way. 
 (She pushes Piper out of the way and Phoebe and Leo head towards the stairs.) 
 Prue: Guys. 
 (Phoebe turns back around.) 
 Phoebe: Uh, I'll be right up. 
 Prue: He's not coming. 
 Piper: Who's not coming? 
 Prue: Dad. He sent this. Um, (she reads the note) girls, something's come up, I hate to leave town. Can't make it to dinner. Probably best if we let the dust settle anyway. I know there's a lot you would like to forget but here's what I remember. Love dad. 
 (She holds up a video tape.) 
 [Time lapse. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are watching the video. On the video it's Christmas. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are there as kids. They are opening their presents. Victor kisses Prue on the cheek and then grabs Piper and lifts her in the air. He then asks what Phoebe got and she holds up a Barbie.]
