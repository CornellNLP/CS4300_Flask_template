 [Scene: Halliwell manor. Kitchen. Piper brings in the groceries. She's holding her shoe. Prue and Phoebe smell something.] 
 Phoebe: What did you buy? 
 Piper: Doody. 
 Prue: We weren't out of that. 
 Piper: No, I stepped in it again. That man has turned our front walk into a puppy mine field. 
 Phoebe: I can not believe that guy still let's his dog do his business right in front of our house. 
 Prue: Yeah, well, we've left notes. 
 Piper: And gotten no where. 
 Phoebe: Yeah, well, I've had it. The next time I catch him in the act, I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind. 
 (A dog barks.) 
 Piper: That couldn't be. 
 Phoebe: Oh, I hope it is. 
 (They run to the window.) 
 Piper: That's them. That's the guy and his dog. I can't believe it. 
 Prue: That is so rude. He's just gonna walk away. 
 Phoebe: Then don't let him. Use your magic. Well, if you can't teach the dog new tricks, how about the owner. Just think the money we'd save on carpet cleaning alone. 
 Prue: Phoebe, we can't use our magic just to teach him or anybody else a lesson. 
 Phoebe: Why not? It's for the greater good, I mean, I mean, that's our job, right? Think of it as community service. We'd be doing our whole block a favour. Come on. (She opens a window.) Okay, Piper. 
 Piper: I hope he's not out of my range. (She freezes the guy.) 
 Phoebe: Prue ... (Prue flicks the poo on his shoe.) Nice shot. (He unfreezes.) An eye for an eye, a shoe for a shoe. (The guy sees the poo on his shoe and tries to wipe it off. He looks around.) 
 Prue, Piper, Phoebe: Ooh! (They duck.) 
 Prue: Did he see you? 
 Phoebe: So what if he did? What's he gonna do? Cry witch? (The guy walks off.) Well, we've done our good deed for the day. I think I deserve fifteen minutes of channel surfing. 
 Piper: Who wants coffee? 
 Prue: I'll grind. 
 (Prue and Piper go to the kitchen. Phoebe sits on the couch and turns on the TV. A news report about Cal Greene shows up. Phoebe has a premonition. She makes a noise and Prue and Piper come in.) 
 Prue: Phoebe, are you okay? 
 Piper: Take a deep breath, honey, it's alright. 
 Phoebe: No, it's not. I saw my future. I was being executed. Burnt alive. 
 Opening Credits 
 [Scene: Halliwell manor. Continued from before.] 
 Piper: Why would a report about a baseball player trigger a premonition like that? 
 Phoebe: I don't know. All I know is I could feel it, I could feel the fire. 
 Piper: And we were just standing there? That can't be right. 
 Phoebe: That's what I saw. 
 Prue: There's no way that we would let that happen, not in the past, present or future. 
 Phoebe: What did I do? Or what is it that I'm going to do? 
 (The doorbell rings.) 
 Piper: That's Leo. I'll get that. (She opens the door.) Hey, stranger. 
 Leo: Is that what I am now? 
 Piper: Playing hooky? 
 Leo: No, they're making me work tonight so I've got the afternoon off. (They hug.) 
 Piper: The old 'I gotta save the world' excuse again? 
 Leo: Like you've never had to use it. 
 Piper: Ahh... 
 Leo: You're about to use it. 
 Piper: Well, there's just something I have to do. Maybe you could ... (The whitelighters make a noise to call Leo.) 
 Leo: Now? 
 Piper: Uh ... Leo? 
 Leo: It's okay, uh, you go. There's actually something I have to take care of. 
 Piper: Well, we really need to talk about things, you know, where we stand. 
 Leo: Yeah, we do. Rain check? 
 Piper: That's what we do best. (They kiss. Leo orbs out in the middle of the kiss.) I hate when he does that. 
 [Cut to the attic. Leo appears. He starts flipping through the pages in the Book of Shadows. He hears Piper, Prue and Phoebe coming up the stairs.] 
 Prue: So, what did he want? 
 (Leo disappears. The pages on the book keep turning.) 
 Piper: He cancelled our date. He's working again. 
 Phoebe: You didn't ask him what to do? 
 Piper: He had to fly ... literally. The pages were doing that flipping thing on their own again. 
 (They look at what the page says.) 
 Prue: It's a spell to take us to the future. 
 Piper: Two actually. One to send us, one to bring us home. But apparently we only get one shot. Once we use it they disappear. 
 Phoebe: Wait a minute, you guys. We almost died going back to the past. This is not something that you just do. 
 Prue: We're talking about your life, Phoebe. 
 Phoebe: And I'm talking about yours, Prue. I'm just saying I think we should think this over a little bit. 
 Prue: Look, you had that premonition today for a reason. It must mean that we're supposed to do something about it. And going to the future might be the only way to find out what you did to put you on that pyre. 
 Phoebe: How do you know it's something that I did? I mean, it might be a demon or a warlock that puts me there. 
 Prue: Do you really want to wait to find out? Okay, pack your bags, we go, try to figure out what happened and hopefully come back with enough information to stop it. We're gonna need a date, Phoebe. 
 Phoebe: February 12, 2009. That's two weeks before the date I saw in my premonition. 
 Prue: Alright, that should give us more than enough time to figure out what put you there. 
 Piper: I wonder how I look? 
 Phoebe: Piper, you look great but this is hardly the time ... 
 Piper: Not now. In the future. When we went back to the seventies we saw ourselves as kids and now we'll be seeing ourselves walk around ten years older. All that vanquishing. Think of the wear and tear. 
 Prue: Okay. (She lights a match and burns the paper.) "Hear these words, hear the rhyme." 
 Piper: "We send to you this burning sign." 
 Phoebe: "Then our future selves will find." 
 Prue: "In another place and time." 
 (They disappear. Piper wakes up on the couch in the manor. A little girl runs in.) 
 Girl: Mummy, mummy, mummy. 
 Piper: Uh, I think you have the wrong house. Certainly the wrong mummy. 
 Girl: Stop fooling. (She hugs Piper. A car honks.) Car pool. (She runs off. Piper looks in the mirror.) 
 Piper: Ooh. (She sees a wedding ring on her finger.) Ooh! (A report about Phoebe shows up on the TV.) Phoebe. Where's the volume? (She looks around for a remote. The sound gets louder by itself.) 
 Reporter: More news on the execution of Phoebe Halliwell coming up in just a moment. Now back to your regular scheduled programming MTV's real world eighteen on the moon. 
 Girl: Mum, I'm gonna be late. 
 Piper: Okay, uh, TV shut up. Mute. Something. 
 (She walks to the door.) 
 Neighbour: Morning, Piper. You alright? 
 Piper: I guess. 
 Neighbour: Yeah, with your sister, it's rough, I know. So, don't worry about your little one. I'll get her to school like you asked but uh, are you sure you want me to take her to your ex's? 
 Piper: Ex? As in husband? As in mine? Yes, if that is what I told you, then yes. 
 Neighbour: So, you and him are getting along better now? 
 Piper: Maybe. Prue? Prue? 
 Neighbour: Okay, let's hit the road. 
 (The girl whispers to Piper.) 
 Girl: Don't worry, mummy. I promise I'll do what you ask. I won't use my magic again ever. 
 (Piper goes outside and watches them drive off. A limo pulls up. Prue and her assistants get out of the limo. They fuss over her by brushing and touching her.) 
 Prue: Hey, hey. Okay, enough! People stop touching me. Stay, stay, stay. 
 Piper: Prue, what's going on? 
 Prue: I don't know, but I could really get used to this. Check me out. I don't just work at Bucklands, I own it. And three more. Paris, Tokyo and London. 
 Piper: And you're blonde. 
 Prue: Yeah, strange. 
 Piper: Wait, you had time to go to work already? 
 Prue: Well, actually, I woke up there but it was amazing. I had all these assistants and this huge office and I have a chauffeur and he's so totally hot. How'd you do? (Piper laughs.) Is that a good thing or ...? 
 (They walk inside.) 
 Piper: Well, if you ignore my apparently failed marriage and the fact that I still live in the manor. 
 Prue: You are married? 
 Piper: Was. My daughter is on her way ... 
 Prue: Wait. Stop right there. You have a daughter? 
 Piper: Yeah, and, and, and she's beautiful. 
 (Piper shows her a photo.) 
 Prue: Of course she is. What's her name? 
 Piper: Oh God. I don't know. But she has powers. But for some reason I told her not to use them. Why would I do that? 
 Prue: Speaking of why ... Why are we in our future bodies? I mean, I thought we were supposed to come here and see them. 
 Piper: Well, apparently going to the past isn't the same as going to the future. I just wish that since we are in our future bodies that we could have some memory of what's happened in the last ten years, like how I got a daughter. 
 Prue: Okay, wait a second, if I'm in my future body and you are in your future body then that means that Phoebe ... 
 Piper: TV ... louder, louder. 
 (The volume on the TV gets louder.) 
 Reporter: ... execution is less than eight hours away until the burning of Phoebe Halliwell. The witch accused of murdering Cal Greene six months ago. 
 Piper: Eight hours? We were supposed to be here two weeks before. 
 Prue: Shh ... 
 Reporter: Let's go there now live where Sierra Stone is standing by. Sierra ... 
 Sierra: San Francisco district attorney, Nathaniel Pratt, who's discovery of the witch last August, has made an early favour for the governor's seat, just came out to make a statement. Let's listen in. 
 Nathaniel: This is a reflection of our citizens resolved to fair it out, the hidden evil. To turn fear into fight, and to band together as one. To cleanse our city of its greatest threat. Tonight, Phoebe Halliwell will burn for her crime. In which she does, let that be a warning to other witches out there. You're next. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Halliwell manor. Attic.] 
 Prue: Oh, surprise. Here we go, up the stairs, into the attic, grabbing the Book of Shadows, please tell me we're not gonna be doing this in ten years. 
 (The book's not there.) 
 Piper: Apparently not. 
 Prue: What? 
 Piper: The book is gone. 
 Prue: It's got to be here, we need it to find the return spell. 
 Piper: Prue ... 
 Prue: Piper, just help me look for it. 
 Piper: Okay, relax, we'll find it. 
 Prue: You don't know that. I mean, what if it's lost, what if we can't find it? Then we're stuck in our future bodies with no way of getting out of them and no way of saving Phoebe. (She flicks her arm and her power destroys the attic.) 
 Piper: Ooh! Been working out? 
 Prue: I guess that's a little sample of what ten years does to our powers. 
 Piper: And to our attic. (Piper sees a key underneath a turned over table.) A key. (She picks it up.) 
 Prue: It's the key to my wall safe at Bucklands. 
 Piper: Do you think that means it's there? We've never taken the book out of the house before. 
 Prue: Yeah, we haven't but maybe our future selves have. The question is why? 
 Piper: We don't even know what we're like in this time, Prue, let alone what we think. But if the book is at Bucklands, maybe it'll give us some answers. 
 Prue: Alright, then we'll go there first, then to Phoebe to see if she's alright. (They walk towards the door.) Sorry about the mess. 
 Piper: Mmm hmm. 
 [Scene: Hobart State Penitentiary. Phoebe's in a prison cell.] 
 Phoebe: Hello? Hello? Could somebody please answer me. I really need to talk to someone. Okay, how about a snack? Maybe some crackers, peanuts, something? (A guy slides a tray full of slop in the room.) A tray full of goo? Hey, wait a minute. (She touches the glass and gives her a shock.) Don't I even get a phone call? 
 Some guy: (From other room.) Shut up, witch! 
 [Scene: Outside Bucklands.] 
 Piper: I can't believe you get a limo and a driver and I've still got my same old car. 
 Prue: You have a husband. 
 Piper: Had a husband. I'm getting divorced remember. And how do you know you don't have a guy in this time? I mean, after all, I have a kid and an ex, you could have several. 
 Prue: Ex's? 
 Piper: No, kids. I mean, we're in the future but with no memory of the past ten years. I don't even know who my ex-husband ...  
 (A guy holding a cup of coffee bumps into someone and Piper freezes him before it spills. They look around and notice everything is frozen.) 
 Prue: Okay, apparently my power isn't the only one that's grown. You just froze ... 
 Piper: Everything. What a difference a decade makes. 
 (Leo shows up.) 
 Leo: What the hell are you doing? 
 Piper: Leo, I'm so glad you're here. I have so many ... (She goes to hug him but he backs away.) Uh ... what's wrong? 
 Leo: You know, I knew you'd do something stupid like this. You used you magic in public. What's the matter with you? Are you insane? 
 Piper: Uh, Leo ... 
 Prue: Remember he thinks we know what's going on. 
 Leo: You wanna end up like your sister? Huh? We had an agreement. No using magic for Melinda's sake. 
 Piper: Melinda? 
 Leo: Our daughter. What's wrong with you? 
 Piper: Our daughter? 
 Prue: Wait a second, you're Piper's ex? 
 (A woman walks around the corner and sees everything frozen.) 
 Woman: Witch! 
 Prue: Okay, what's going on here? 
 Piper: Prue ... 
 (They see posters saying "Rid the evil. Turn in witches".) 
 Woman: Over there! Witch! 
 (Everyone unfreezes.) 
 Leo: Alright, hurry, we gotta get outta here before they see you. 
 Piper: They? 
 Leo: The witch hunters. 
 [Scene: Penitentiary. Phoebe hears a door open.] 
 Phoebe: Prue? Piper? 
 Nathaniel: They haven't come to visit you before. Why would they come now? They're gonna be as happy to get rid of you than I am. 
 Phoebe: Who are you? 
 Nathaniel: I'm sorry. It's been so long since our last visit. Executions are a bitch to plan. Logistics, alerting the media, gathering the kindling. 
 Phoebe: Uh, you know, I've had a lot of time to do some thinking about why I'm here. 
 Nathaniel: No amount of thinking will affect the outcome. Just as well been served for the crime. 
 Phoebe: Wasn't really a big crime was it? 
 Nathaniel: You are truly evil. What bigger crime is there than taking a man's life? 
 Phoebe: I killed someone? 
 Nathaniel: Phoebe, what is this? An attempt to stay your execution? Plead insanity? It won't work. You have five hours to live. Tick tock. 
 Phoebe: What? Five hours? But that's not possible. 
 Nathaniel: Well, I'm happy to see the seriousness of this crime has finally hit you. See, you represent everything I appoar. You're a threat. A danger to everything that is good and pure in our world. 
 Phoebe: You're talking out of fear. Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it evil. 
 Nathaniel: No, it's you who doesn't understand. You killed a man using your power and now you're gonna die because of it. I only wish I could burn all of your kind with you. But don't worry, in time I will. This is only the beginning. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Underground. A lot of people are living there.] 
 Prue: Leo, listen to me. The two of us, the Prue and Piper that you see before you are from the past. From ten years ago. 
 Piper: So, we have no idea what is going on. 
 Leo: Don't even lie to me. Right, Phoebe is set to die today and I only hope that this madness dies with her. Right, these people are in danger because of the witch trials she started. 
 Prue: How? How did she start them? 
 Leo: You know, I don't know what you hope to accomplish by pretending not to know ... (Piper kisses him passionately.) You haven't kissed me like that since ... 
 Piper: Since this morning. 1999, remember? We were supposed to meet, you had to leave, I went up to the attic and this is where I came, the future. If you don't believe me, at least believe what you feel, trust that. 
 Leo: I remember that was the day they sent me up to the attic to open the Book of Shadows, the future spell. 
 Prue: Wait, that was you? We just assumed it was Grams. 
 Leo: No, it was me. They didn't tell me why. What, you don't know what's happened the last ten years? (Prue shakes her head.) These people, they're here underground because they've been accused of practicing witchcraft. 
 Prue: They're witches? 
 Leo: Some of them. Most of them have been falsely accused. They're safe here for now. 
 Prue: What did Phoebe do? 
 Leo: Six months ago she killed a man. Cal Greene. 
 Piper: The baseball player? 
 Prue: This is crazy. I mean, Phoebe would never hurt anyone. 
 Leo: She hurt him because he murdered someone. Someone Phoebe cared about very much. A dear friend who he brutalized. But a technicality set him free. Phoebe was furious, outraged. And that's when she crossed the line from protecting the innocent to punishing the guilty. She used her power to kill Greene, got caught, and her magic exposed by Nathaniel Pratt. 
 Piper: And this is the result modern day witch trials with Pratt at the helm? 
 Prue: And Phoebe at the stake. I don't buy it. Her power can't kill. 
 Leo: Well, it can now. It's been ten years. All your powers have grown. 
 Piper: We have to get to Phoebe and explain. 
 Leo: You can't. Alright, as it stands, you and Prue are safe. Pratt checked you out and he doesn't suspect you're witches. To get to Phoebe you'd have to use your powers and then they'll catch you then kill you. 
 Piper: Leo, she's our sister. We're not gonna let her die. 
 Leo: Wait, I'll go. 
 Prue: Leo, this is our sister. We have to. 
 Leo: No. I'm still your guide. I can orb in and keep you out of danger. 
 Piper: Fine. Then we'll go back to Buckland's and get the book and get the spell to get us home. 
 Prue: We'll meet you at the manor. 
 Piper: Leo, um, we got married? (Leo smiles.) 
 Prue: Piper, later. We'll have plenty of time later. 
 [Scene: Bucklands. Prue and Phoebe walk out of the elevator and all these people crowd around them.] 
 Woman: Miss Halliwell, can you sign the P.O ... 
 (Everyone starts talking at once.) 
 Prue's assistant: Give the woman some air. She will meet with all of you after lunch. Thankyou. (They go into Prue's office.) Okay, good news first. The requisition paper work was approved and ... (Piper enters her office.) Yes? 
 Piper: I'm with her. 
 (Prue's assistant looks at Prue confused.) 
 Prue: It's Piper. My sister. 
 Assistant: Oh, right, sorry. Almost forgot you had another one, I mean other than ... 
 Piper: That's okay, I forgot your name too. 
 Anne: Anne. Miss Halliwell's personal assistant. 
 Prue: Anne, right, my personal assistant. By the way Anne, um, do you know if my husband called by any chance? 
 (Anne laughs.) 
 Anne: Husband, good one. Very funny. Like you have the time. Okay, I just need to get your final okay on the acquisition. Your sister was amazing. I mean, at first the board was a little resistant, what with the lay off it would entail, but Prue pushed it through. 
 Prue: I did? 
 Anne: I thought to hell with the little people part was particularly persuasive. 
 Prue: Okay, Anne, sweetie, I really need some private time with my sister, so if you can just ... 
 Anne: Oh, no problem, just buzz me. 
 (Anne leaves.) 
 Prue: Look at me. Alright, I am booked with work, I'm about to lay off countless people with a flick of my pen, no man to speak of. 
 Piper: Maybe you're just picky. 
 Prue: What's happened to me? Okay, well, I could dwell on the nightmare that my life has become, but we have work to do. At least some things around here haven't changed. (She opens the wall safe and gets out the Book of Shadows.) 
 Piper: Okay, it should be after the demon with the tusk and before the spell to discourage a lover. (They look for it in the book but it's not there.) Where is it? It was here in 1999. 
 Prue: Yeah, and now it's gone. So, if the spell can only been used once, that must mean that our future selves have already used it. Which means ... 
 Piper: We have no way of getting home. 
 [Scene: Penitentiary. Leo orbs in.] 
 Phoebe: Leo, oh, thank God. Look, I know what they think I did and if you just ... 
 Leo: Shh ... they'll hear you. 
 Phoebe: Where's the rest of the cavalry? 
 Leo: They're not coming. 
 Piper: So, what, you'll grab me and we'll just orb and we'll meet them back at the ... 
 Leo: Phoebe ... I'm sorry. 
 Phoebe: For what? Did something happen to my sisters? 
 Leo: Nobody's gonna rescue you. 
 (Phoebe laughs.) 
 Phoebe: If that is some kind of whitelighter humour, let me be the first to tell you, you are not a very funny race of people. 
 Leo: I wish you remembered what you'd done. It'd make this so much easier. Your future self used witchcraft for vengeance, Phoebe. Pratt is using that as a plan for him. 
 Phoebe: Why does everyone think I killed someone? I wouldn't. I mean, I couldn't. What did I do? Premonition the man to death? My power is passive. 
 Leo: Not in the future. It's grown. As have you. Which means unfortunately you have to suffer to consequences. 
 Phoebe: I don't believe it. 
 Leo: Then believe what you see. (He hands her a newspaper clipping. Phoebe has a premonition. In it she held her hands either side of Cal Greene's head without touching and electricity-like power came out of her hands and killed him.) 
 Phoebe: Oh my God. What have I done? (Leo orbs out.) Help me! 
 Commercial Break 
 
 
 
 [Scene: Halliwell manor.] 
 Piper: You wanna tell me how screwed we are? 
 Prue: Pretty screwed. 
 Piper: Thanks. I wonder what's taking Leo so long? 
 Prue: (Looking through the B.O.S.) Some of the pages are marked. The top corners are turned down and all of them are new spells. 
 Piper: Such as? 
 Prue: Like, here's a spell to create a door, one to induce slumber, a glamour to change ones appearance. Some of them have these baggies attached. 
 Piper: This must be potions of some kind. 
 Prue: But what about these? Okay, one to create money, to bend someone's will, to erase a memory, a binding spell. 
 Piper: Binding? What are all these marked for? 
 Prue: This must of been our future selves plan to break Phoebe out. But something is bothering me. Clearly some of these spells are for personal gain. 
 Piper: Which would break the most basic of wiccan rules. We wouldn't do that. 
 Prue: We wouldn't. But maybe in ten years our future selves would. 
 (Leo walks in.) 
 Piper: Perfect timing. We found the book but we can't ... Where's Phoebe? 
 Prue: Where is she? 
 Leo: She's in prison where she belongs. 
 Prue: Leo, you were supposed to bring her back here. 
 Leo: No, I said I'd go to her. And I did. To explain to her why she has to pay for her crime. 
 Piper: You're our guide, you're supposed to protect us and you're just gonna let her die. 
 Prue: You're signing her death warrant. 
 Leo: I'm to protect the greater good. If Phoebe lives, if you use your magic to save her, then the persecutions will continue. And our daughter will grow into a world where her powers punishable by death. Do you want that? 
 Piper: Of course not. 
 Leo: Well, then it has to end with Phoebe. She has to die. 
 Prue: Like hell. 
 (Piper freezes Leo.) 
 Piper: Relax. We've seen what your new powers can do when you're angry. 
 Prue: He's gonna stay frozen right? 
 Piper: If he knows what's good for him, he'll stay frozen. 
 Prue: Alright, let's get the spell. 
 [Scene: Penitentiary.] 
 Nathaniel: (on TV) Now, some people say this is a victory for me. But I say here's a victory for us all. For today the blight on everything that is good in our world, will be extinguished. Tonight, the witch will burn! 
 [Scene: Leo's house. Piper and Prue are in the car.] 
 Prue: Piper, if you're gonna do this, you'd better hurry. Leo can unfreeze and be home any second. Besides, Phoebe has less than an hour. 
 (She gets out of the car. She looks through a window and sees Melinda playing. Piper is holding a bind spell. Leo appears.) 
 Leo: You can't do it can you? 
 Piper: No. Our grandmother did it to us for protection. 
 Leo: You don't have to bind her powers, Piper. We agreed that I'd take care of her and I will, I promise. 
 Piper: I know you will. So we were together. Does that mean you clipped your wings for me? 
 Leo: No. You wouldn't let me. We tried to make it work with her powers, and it didn't, and all this happened. 
 Piper: Were we happy? Just for a little while were we happy? 
 Leo: Very. 
 Piper: Are you gonna try and stop us? 
 Leo: I can't do that. 
 Piper: I hope you understand why I have to do what I'm doing. 
 Leo: Yeah. 
 Piper: What are we gonna do? 
 Leo: What we always do. 
 Piper: Talk about it later. (Piper gets back in the car. Prue looks upset.) What is it? What's wrong? 
 Prue: I have no one to say goodbye to. My life, they didn't even know who you were at the office., my own sister. If we die tonight, my tombstone will read "Here lies Prue, she worked hard". 
 Piper: We're not gonna die. We're gonna find a way back to the present and we'll create a new future. 
 Prue: What if we can't. What if we can never get home. According to Phoebe's premonition we fail. 
 Piper: Our future selves fail. We still got a shot. 
 Prue: You're right, you're right. Let's go get Phoebe. 
 [Scene: Outside the penitentiary next to a big wall.] 
 Prue: So far so good. 
 Piper: Normal people usually break out of prison. 
 Prue: Nothing about this is normal. 
 Piper: To create a door, okay. 
 Prue: No place like here. 
 Piper: Okay. (She draws an imaginary door on the wall with her finger.) 
 Prue: Kinda small for us dontcha think? When you find your path is blocked, all you have to do is knock. (Piper knocks. The door opens and they walk inside.) 
 [Cut to Phoebe. Two guards put handcuffs on her.] 
 [Cut back to Prue and Piper.] 
 Guard: Freeze! 
 Piper: Good idea. (She freezes him.) 
 Prue: Alright, um, the cell should be up those stairs, come on. She'll be guarded, are you ready for this? 
 Piper: Do we have a choice? 
 (Phoebe's cell is empty.) 
 Prue: We're too late. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Penitentiary. In a room where Phoebe is tied to a pole and below her feet are holes where the fire comes out.] 
 Nathaniel: I love the smell of burnt witch in the morning. 
 Phoebe: At least I'm paying for my crime. There'll come a day where you have to pay for yours too. 
 Nathaniel: Remorseless to the end, huh. (To the people watching.) Let today be a lesson to all those who would seek to defy human nature with their way of life. Let today serve notice that black magic will not be tolerated in our society and let today be remembered as the day we burned the witch. 
 (Prue and Piper enter the room.) 
 Prue: Piper, freeze them. 
 Phoebe: Prue, Piper. 
 Piper: We're getting you outta here. 
 (Prue unties her.) 
 Phoebe: No, wait. You can't Prue, I'm serious. 
 Prue: What are you talking about? 
 Phoebe: You guys have to leave. I deserve to be here. Or my future self does. 
 Piper: You killed a killer. Don't be ridiculous. 
 Prue: Look, this is Pratt's personal crusade. This isn't about us, this is about him. Where ever we go, he will follow us. He will hunt us. He will hunt our families. If anybody should be punished, it should be him. 
 (Prue gets ready to use her power.) 
 Phoebe: Prue, what are you doing? 
 Prue: Saving the future good witches and our future. 
 Phoebe: Prue, wait! Don't become a murderer too. It has to end with me. 
 Piper: Phoebe, he was evil, he deserved what you ... 
 Phoebe: (She starts to cry.) Wrong things done for the right reasons still the wrong thing. Our job is to protect the innocent, not punish the guilty. And I crossed that line, I know that. And now you guys have to know that too. 
 (They all start crying.) 
 Prue: We are not leaving here without you. 
 Phoebe: Prue, we were sent here for a reason. Maybe not to stop this like we thought. But maybe to understand why this has to happen. Why you have to let this happen. I don't want to die. But I don't want you to die because of me. (They hug.) I love you. 
 (She stands back next to the pole. Everyone unfreezes. They turn on the flames and Phoebe burns to death.) 
 [Phoebe and Prue end up back in the manor.] 
 Piper: Prue ... 
 Prue: What are we doing here? 
 Piper: Phoebe? You don't think she was ... we saw ... 
 Prue: I know. Oh, please God, don't let it be true. Phoebe! (Phoebe walks in the room. They hug.) We thought that we lost you. 
 Phoebe: You did. I was burned. And I could, I could fell the flames on my skin. And then I was here. I don't know what happened. 
 Prue: It's okay, you're safe now, you're home. 
 Piper: You're home, but when? (She turns on the TV. The report about Cal Greene comes on.) 
 Phoebe: Wait, that's the baseball player. That's what triggered my premonition. We're right back where we started. The day we cast a spell. 
 Piper: Why? 
 Prue: Maybe because it worked. We were sent into the future to find out what Phoebe did. We came back to stop it from happening. 
 Piper: But we didn't cast a spell to come back. We didn't even have one. 
 Phoebe: Maybe they sent us back. 
 Piper: But who? And why today? If we were sent back to keep the future from happening, shouldn't we be sent back to the day Phoebe killed Cal Greene instead? 
 (They hear a dog bark. They go to the window.) 
 Prue: Not again. (The guy's dog squats on their path.) 
 Piper: This guy still hasn't learnt his lesson. 
 Phoebe: Apparently neither have we. I think this is why we were sent back here to this moment and time. This is where it all started. The first time we used our magic for revenge. 
 Piper: But it's just a little thing, it's harmless. 
 Phoebe: Yeah, but once you break the small rules, it's only a matter of time before the big ones are next. 
 Prue: A very smart girl once told me that we were supposed to protect the innocent not punish the guilty. 
 Phoebe: I haven't told you yet. 
 Piper: Maybe you won't have to. (Prue sees the face of the guy.) 
 Prue: Pratt. 
 (Pratt walks away.) 
 Piper: Do you think we should follow? 
 Phoebe: No. Our little act of revenge might of been what sent Pratt on his path to seek us all. 
 Prue: Which might of let him to start the future witch trials. 
 Phoebe: Hopefully now he won't. 
 Piper: I still think we should keep an eye on him just in case. 
 Prue: Absolutely. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Manor. Prue picks up the phone.] 
 Phoebe: Hey, what's up? 
 Prue: Not work. There is no way I am going to the office tonight. I'm going out with you guys. We all have a lot of changes to make if we want to avoid ending up where we just came from. 
 Piper: I had a future that wasn't all bad. You were like Miss Fortune five hundred and I had a beautiful little girl. 
 Phoebe: What? 
 Piper: Details later. 
 Prue: You know, we can still make the good things happen, Piper. We just have to make the right choices. 
 Piper: So maybe Leo and I will end up together. 
 Phoebe: Wait, you and Leo? 
 (The doorbell rings.) 
 Piper: Speak of the angel. I'll get that. (She answers the door.) Hey, stranger. (She grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) 
 Leo: I would of settled for a nice hello. 
 Piper: Didn't anyone tell you not to settle? 
 Leo: That's a good lesson. 
 Piper: I've been learning a lot of them lately. 
 Leo: So I've heard. Look, honestly, I didn't know you were gonna get sent to the future. I don't even know what happened when you got there. All I was told was apparently you had something to learn. 
 Piper: So, that's why you're here. 
 Leo: No. That's why you're here. You were given a glimpse of your future to learn a valuable lesson. And I'm glad you learned it too because I know they wouldn't of brought you back if you didn't. Speaking of which, they're making me work tonight, so I can't really ... 
 Piper: This is always gonna be a problem for us isn't it? 
 Leo: I'm willing to work on it. 
 Piper: Good. Because I'll never forget you said that. 
 (They kiss passionately.)
