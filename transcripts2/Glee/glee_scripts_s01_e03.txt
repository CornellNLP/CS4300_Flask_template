 Rachel went away. 
 Rachel : I've moved on and i'm bousingo on my career now. 
 Finn : So you want to talk about it?

 Dakota : Hum! Hum! 
 Rachel : What's smelt? 
 Dakota : A pungent low-carb freshwater fish. Okay, let's start with today's business. Artie, you're cut. 
 Artie : You're not. 
 Dakota : Trying hard enough at what? At walking. we can't be wheeling you around during every number. It throws off the whole dynamic, and it's depressing. 
 Mercedes : So, you're kicking him out? 
 Dakota : Mm-hmm. Also you. ouse got to go, Effie. 
 Mercedes : Oh! ... 
 Dakota : No, no, no. Yeah. 
 Kurt : You can't kick people out of Glee Club because you don't like the way they look. 
 Dakota : Uh, why don't you shut your face-gash and stay away from aerosol cans because you could burst into flames at any second? You three ...you're great. you're perfect. Seriously. don't change thing. Uh, you..... ew, nose job. 
 Finn : Now just hold on a second. What? 
 Dakota : What was that, frankenteen? Why don't you, uh, wipe that Dopey look off your face and get some lotion for those knuckles you've been dragging on the ground? 
 Finn : What's wrong with you? 
 Dakota : What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me is that you're freakishly tall. I feel like a woodland Creature. Um, am I hurting your feelings? Did I say something wrong? Because I thought you wanted somebody who respected you enough to tell you the truth. But maybe you don't have the confidence to hear it, hmm? Maybe you need somebody who's going to Lie to you and tell you things like, "you got what it takes." But you know what? As far as I can see, you don't. So, why don't you just take a little second, take a breather, and ask yourself, "do I want to be a winner..or not?" 
 Finn : Screw this. I quit. 
 Finn leaves followed by Tina. 
 Artie : Me too 
 Mercedes : Let's roll, Artie.

 Rachel : Wait. (Everyone stops.) Barbra streisand. When barbra was a young ingenue, everyone told her in order to be a star. She'd have to get a nose job. Thankfully, she refused. 
 Dakota : Where's this going, yentl? 
 Rachel : Where it's going is that... We don't need you. Let's face it. We're never going to be as good of dancers as Vocal Adrenaline. We're gonna win because... we're different. And that's what makes us special. 
 Mercedes : They told J.Lo her booty was too big. 
 Artie : Curtis Mayfield was more successful after he became paralyzed. 
 Finn : Jim Abbot. 
 Kurt : I have no idea who that is. 
 Finn : He was a one-armed pitcher for the yankees. Pitched a no-hitter. 
 Dakota : Okay, so, yeah. Misfits and spaz-heads and cripples can make it, too. That's great. What's your point?
