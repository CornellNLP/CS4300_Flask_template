 Scene 1: Teachers' Corner - Will, Emma, Ken 
 Emma and the coach Tanaka are eating when Will arrives. 
 Will: Hi. Can I join you? (He sits) Why everyone pomponne? 
 Emma: Class photo. This is the fiftieth edition of the McKinley High School. 
 Ken: I have raised 10 pounds Friday to look hot on the picture and be on my 31 for the wedding in two weeks. 
 Emma: Of course, the wedding was to take place in Hawaii, but I was told that I could not bring my fruit, so ... 
 Will: But the selections are in two weeks. 
 Ken: Oh, damn. You can not be, Eminem. 
 Emma: I completely forgot. I'm sorry. I wanted to come. For children. 
 Ken: We will not reorganize everything. The veterans hall is taken up in June It is only free Saturday because of the anniversary of the "Grizzly Fried Fish". I have a big discount. We must leave before the candlelight vigil. 
 Emma: I remember. Oh my god! Sue, you've finally hit someone? 
 Sue approaching their table. 
 Sue: Edie. William. You. Every year when the period comes from the album, I always dais a little something. This year, I paid a lifting eye. I took the opportunity to ask me to remove their lacrimal glands. I used it not. I have a whole closet full of trophies and medals. (She takes a chair and sits) But for you, mere teachers, this album is the only concrete evidence that anything you did in your poor little lives have made any difference. My cheerleaders are so excited. I put the sweet potato diet. It draws water out of the skin. 
 Will: I'm sure my choir will be delighted. 
 Sue: The choir will not have a photo. 
 Emma: What? Why? 
 Sue: I leave the principal's office Figgins, Eleanor. About the vandalism on the pictures of the old choir. I convinced him that put them in the abum of the year amounted to expose these monsters to more humiliation and ridicule. 
 Will: Why can not you accept that they will win this year? 
 Sue: It will not happen. 
 Will: And stop your ridiculous vendetta. 
 Emma: Yes. This is really unfair. 
 Will: I'll talk to Figgins. 
 Sue: Have fun. You bore me now. I'll do something else. 
 Sue goes. Will is ennervé. 
 Scene 2: Classroom - The New Directions 
 The New Directions, Rachel are without a meeting about the albums choirs. 
 Kurt: Rachel is there? 
 Finn: Not yet. 
 Kurt: All right. The club is in a difficult position. We all received the frosted juice in his face. For now, our relative anonymity protects us from the harshest persecution. Daubed. Tire-patriotic pants. 
 Mercedes: What is a breast patriotic pants? 
 Finn: That's when you attach the flagpole by the underwear. 
 Artie: Oddly, it makes me feel more American. 
 Kurt: After investigation, I think the album would only fuel the flames of terror antichorale. I did some research. (He opens the photo albums of old choirs) Peter Gellar. Second tenor, 1998. Can be seen here with Hitler's mustache and a Chinese hat. Soon after the album's release, Mr. Gellar became depressed. He is the homeless who sleeps in front of the library. 
 Quinn: Patches? 
 Kurt: Patches. 
 Brittany: He barks at my mother. 
 Kurt: Example B. Tawny Peterson. The choir promo 2000. Here, with a knife in the head. A macabre table four years later, will prove prescient. I speak for everyone when I say that not having to ask for the album could be a blessing. I suggest we let it flow. 
 Will arrives. 
 Will: Hi everyone. Looking at the old albums. 
 Artie: It's totally annoying. 
 Will: And completely unfair. Can I borrow it? (He takes the album) You know what? The album this year will be a photo of each of your smiling faces. I promise. 
 Scene 3: Office of the Principal Figgins - Will Figgins 
 Figgins: Shue, I do them a favor. Thus, other students will not humiliate them more. 
 Will: They take the stage all the time to enjoy their passion one likes them or not. They do not let anything or anyone, to reach them. You should support them! Sue is wrong. 
 Figgins: Very good. They will have their photo. 
 Will: Thank you. 
 Figgins: It will cost $ 1000. 
 Will: What? 
 Figgins: This is the price. The album is primarily a school advertising space. The funeral Frederickson grew by 1.3% of their income after their full-page album of last year. 
 Will: What would it cost a quarter of a page? 
 Figgins: $ 325. This is the price for a photograph with two members of the choir. In advertising for sandwiches from Uncle Sandro. 
 Will: It's too expensive. 
 Figgins: We'll deal with it. I think you should choose a pretty cheerleader, but not pregnant, and the quarterback for the photo. There will thus be less likely that they face Doodles. 
 Rahcel arrives unannounced. 
 Rachel: Mr Shuester. Excuse me for interrupting you. Principal Figgins, this is my first year in the choir and I just learned it will not be in the album.As you can imagine my gay dads are very active in defending my rights ... 
 Will: Leaves, Rachel. Consider it done. It will be in the album. 
 Rachel: Fantastic. Thank you very much. 
 She leaves and walks down the hall. 
 Rachel (Voiceover): Laugh if you will, but I want the class photos. (She arrives in the library) and I am preparing to dazzle the paparazzi. So they either intrusive, the stars need the press and I must prepare myself.Therefore, as soon as I can, I signed up for clubs. You probably think I do it out of interest, without me really involved. Not true for the choir. I really like. I share the values it. We are the dregs, rejected and humiliated by all, but we made something of ourselves, something I am proud, I want to be remembered. 
 She walks past Quinn, Brittany and Santana. These last two scribble on Rachel's head pictures. 
 Santana: It's the total. 
 Quinn (Voiceover): The uniform of the pom-poms I miss. It made me feel safe. Framed. Even when I was lonely, I was at least part of a group. 
 Quinn found only in the library, looking at an album. 
 Quinn (Voiceover): When my children see these albums, which I was, I want them to be proud. Not the little b*st*rd that I wear, but those that I would if I were married. I am perhaps more cheerleader, but my heart is still with them. I stop playing the victims. When you take the picture of pom-poms, I found my place who likes it or not to Sue Sylvester. 
 She gets up and walks away, determined. 
 Scene 4: At Will and Terri - Terri, Will 
 Terri watching TV, lying on the couch. Will arrives. 
 Will: Baby, what a tie is better? 
 Terri: You hide the TV, Will. 
 Will: Come on, I need you. That's the class photo. 
 Terri: Well, in this case ... the red to the picture of teachers and the green for the choir. It will get better with scribbles. 
 Will sits beside her. 
 Will: I wanted to tell you about it. Figgins does not want the choir on the album, because of scribbles. It makes me sad for the kids. They work hard. They deserve respect. Refuse the choir on the album, is like denying. I want to buy an insert for the photo of the choir. It will cost $ 300. 
 Terri: Great. There you just have to give them what we need food. The food that keeps your baby alive. 
 Will: We have $ 200 from the sale of the Blue Bomb. 
 Terri: No. It is not. 
 Will: But if ... 
 Terri: No! ... No! ... No! 
  Scene 5: Office of the Principal Figgins - Will Figgins 
 Will signing the check for album of the choir. 
 Will: Actually, can you wait until Thursday to cash it? 
 Figgins accepts and takes the money, happy. 
 Scene 6: Classroom - The New Directions 
 Kurt plays the piano and Rachel just talk to him. 
 Rachel: I have a great idea for a club that I would officially become the most committed student. I want us to do a Allgaylesb. 
 Kurt: I'm sorry? 
 Rachel: The Gay and Lesbian Alliance. All-Gay Lesb. 
 Kurt gets up and joins the other students. Will arrives. 
 Will: Hey, good news! The choir will have a photo to the album. (Everyone hides the fact that he is not happy, except that Rachel is more than happy) It will show everyone that the choir is cool. When we have won the regional, these photos will be collectible. All your classmates you begging for an autograph. But I had to make a compromise. It was a quarter page.We must therefore choose two team captains who will make the picture.Tomorrow, we will vote to choose them. Exciting, no? All right. 
 Will goes away happy. 
 Scene 7: Classroom - The New Directions 
 The New Directions waiting assient on their chairs. 
 Mercedes: We're here. We should vote. 
 Rachel: Let me say a few words. 
 Mercedes: I called Rachel. 
 Kurt: Me too. 
 Puck: I, I'm fine. I have to put on top for the photo of the football team. 
 A few minutes later, Will records the results. 
 Will: It seems that you all voted for Rachel. Even Rachel elsewhere. But we have two captains. 
 Quinn: Why? We are happy that Rachel is only us. 
 Kurt: Actually, we prefer. 
 Scene 8: Office of Emma - Will, Emma 
 Will discusses the problems with the choir. 
 Will: What's worse is that after all this time, they always ashamed of the choir. They still see themselves as zero. Would have one of them react and become co-captain. 
 Emma: Well, you probably should go through their elected Captain. Said by a peer, things sound different. Although this pair is also annoying as Rachel. You know, none of this will be a problem only if they win selections. I apologize for not being able to come. 
 Will: I wanted to talk about that. I think Ken has done on purpose to plan the wedding on the same day. Not for you to come. 
 Emma: Why he would do that? 
 Will: We both know how he sees our ... relationship. 
 Emma: I'm going to marry Ken. I know that I have ... given reason to be jealous before, but you must know that I'm done with it. Ken has many faults. I counted 74, but it is not resentful. It's really a good guy. It is nice and great with students. It has that in common. It's true, it could improve his health, but it is filled with compassion, that's why I'm going to marry her. 
 Will: You're right. I crossed the line. It will not happen again. 
 Will out of the office. 
 Scene 9: Classroom - Will, Rachel 
 Will prepare and Rachel enters the room. 
 Rachel: You wanted to see me, mr Shue? 
 Will: Yes, Rachel. Sit down. How is the direction of the choir? 
 Rachel: (She sits down) My unanimous election will allow me to make things happen. 
 Will: Great, well, I have a job for you, Captain. (He sits beside her) We need a co-captain. You have so many good ideas, he'll have to help to achieve them. 
 Rachel: A lieutenant would come in handy. I have over 65 offers. 
 Will: I can trust you? 
 Rachel: No problem. I'm on it. 
 They shake hands. 
 Scene 10: Corridor - Rachel, Mercedes 
 Rachel and Mercedes discuss. 
 Mercedes: I can not be co-captain. I have no time. That's Kwanza.

 Scene 11: Corner of the corridor - Rachel, Artie 
 Artie: I love to be in the photo, but you and me sitting upright it would spoil everything. 
 Rachel: I would look. 
 Artie: But if you do that, people will think you have a stomach ache. 
 Rachel: All in all, you do not have the makings of a leader. 
 Artie: A follower. 
 Artie goes.

 Rachel Finn walks alone but follows it. 
 Rachel: I despair. The choir needs you. 
 Finn: Thanks but you should take someone more involved. I am, but I football, friends and everything. 
 Rachel: The choir works only since you arrived. Pom-poms and football players would not have come if you were not there. 
 Finn: You know I love the choir. But why do I represent? 
 Rachel: Because you are a leader, Finn. That's what leaders do. They commit themselves to those they love. Much is at stake. Morale is low, you know. If nothing changes, we'll miss the selections and the choir is over. I could not do it alone. 
 Finn: You're not anymore. I am a leader. This is what I am, what I want to be. You have a co-captain. I do the picture with you. 
 Rachel smiles of happiness. 
 Scene 14: Classroom - Rachel Finn 
 Rachel: I know that as captain of the football team, you worked hard to give the impression of being strong as a rock. But the choir, it's different. It must be the epitome of positivity and optimism. So we will train and I'll teach you to smile correctly on a photo. 
 Rachel and Finn sings "Smile" (Lily Allen).

 Finn: (He bangs against the wall) f*ck, Karofsky! I'm sick of you people abase. 
 Azimio: Stop your speech out loud chorus. The system puts in place those who disturb the order. (Finn pushes) You got several options. Want to Hitler's mustache on the picture? Or horse teeth? What do you want? I do not care anyway. I will ... 
 Finn pushes him back.

 Rachel: Sorry. It's just that ... I ennevée. My co-captain dropped me ... I'm sorry, just a minute. 
 She gets up and goes to the mirror. 
 Rachel (Voiceover): Pull yourself. Stop thinking about the judgment of others or how they disappoint you. It is lonely at the top, you know. What is the song to overcome personal and professional disappointments?(She sings) When you're smiling. When you're smiling. The Whole World smiles with you. 
 She turns to the photographer. 
 Rachel: I'm ready. 
 She sits down, looks at the chair for Finn, begins profile and smiled. The photographer takes two pictures.

 Photographer: My brother is a commercial for his store. I realize. School pictures, it's for money. (Rachel starts to cry) Wait, I can take more pictures for you. 
 Rachel: I cry on demand. One of my talents. I am versatile and apart from the nudity and abuse of animals, I'd do anything for power drill.

 Rachel: I can help. 
 Scene 17: Classroom - The New Directions 
 Rachel: Let me begin this meeting. (It will close the door but Finn comes at the same time) Hi Finn. Nice coming.

 Puck: He sacrificed himself for us. Courageous. 
 Will: We worked very hard, you should try your luck. 
 Finn: We succeed without you. Maybe not even with you. 
 Will: That's not true. You are good. Even very good. You made "Jump" for the ad, without me. Listen, the best teachers do not give answers, they show you the way and let you make your choices, your own mistakes.Thus, the glory you will return. You deserve it. If you can not win without me is that I did my job poorly.
