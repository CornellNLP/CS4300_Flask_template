 Here's what's happened on Glee if you live in a cave or just got out of prison. 
  - Will took over the Glee Club. 
  At first they were terrible. 
  - We suck. 
  But then they got kind of good. 
  Quinn got pregnant and said it was Finn's but it was Puck's. 
  - I'm done with you! 
  - And Will's wife, Terri, said she was pregnant. 
  - But she was just scared that Will liked Emma. 
  - I just left my wife. 
  - And then they kissed. 
  - I want you to be happy, Finn. 
  Rachel loves that she and Finn are the Glee Club's new power couple. 
  But he seems weird about it. 
  Sue tried to throw sectionals, but they won anyway. 
  - Which is pretty exciting. 
  - This is a travesty of international proportions. 
  That's what you missed on Glee. 
  - [School Bell Rings] 
  - [Chattering] 
  - Hey, babe. 
  Looking good. 
  - Feeling good, Mercedes. 
  This is amazing. 
  Ever since Glee Club won sectionals everybody looks at us differently. 
  - I wanna be with you, Rachel. 
  - We're glitterati. 
  - I feel like Lady Gaga. 
  - Get used to it, guys. 
  We're stars now on par with all the jocks and popular kids. 
  It's the dawn of a new era here at McKinley and we are gonna rule this school. 
  Ooh-hoo. 
  Welcome to Loser Town. 
  Population: You. 
  But I don't understand. 
  We won sectionals. 
  I've completely demonstrated the validity of this program. 
  Now you're saying we have to place at regionals or the Glee Club's gone? 
  Schue, that was the deal from the beginning. 
  I still have a bottom line. 
  Those spotlights in the auditorium don't run on dreams. 
  Our electricity consumption is up two percent. 
  Besides, it's cold out, Schue and the Cheerios can no longer practice out of doors. 
  They need the use of the auditorium as well. 
  But the Cheerios don't even have a coach. 
  [Sue] 
  Oh, yes, they do. 
  Hey, buddy, you get a haircut? 
  Looks awful. 
  - What are you doing here? 
  - I'm just dropping off a mocha for my maharishi. 
  I took the liberty of making it a double whip. 
  Because after our conciliatory dinner I happen to know that there is nothing you won't eat whipped cream off of. 
  [Blowing] 
  Would've gotten you one, Will, but I don't like you. 
  Okay. 
  Okay, what the hell is going on here? 
  You suspended her after she leaked our set list to sectionals. 
  Yes, and the point of suspension is reinstatement. 
  [Pushing Buttons] 
  [Crowd Cheering] 
  [Finn's Voice] 
  In some ways, I'm happy football season's over. 
  I did set the single-season record for being sacked, but we only won one game. 
  So I'm hoping basketball can be a fresh start. 
  The fact is, I'm kind of depressed. 
  Hey! 
  - Hey, Finn. 
  - Oh. 
  I made us his-and-her relationship calendars. 
  That way, we always know what the other is up to so you can't say you forgot we had plans when you miss our dates anymore. 
  Great. 
  But I'm kind of allergic to cats, so I filled in all of our dates for the next month. 
  On the sixth, we're going to see Phantom at the Autistic Children's Center. 
  [Finn] 
  I know I saved Glee Club, and I guess chicks dig me but I guess if I'm being honest, it's more like I'm not over her. 
  I'm not breaking up with you. 
  I'm just saying please stop super-sizing 'cause I don't dig on fat chicks. 
  - I'm pregnant. 
  - And that's my fault? 
  - And Rachel now that we're sort of dating - [Chattering, Indistinct] 
  I have to work so much harder to pretend to be listening to her. 
  That sounds great. 
  Sometimes I wish I could be more like Coach Tanaka. 
  He pulled a Jessica Simpson. 
  You know, lost his fiance gained 40 pounds and stopped showering. 
  And everyone acts like it's totally normal. 
  - [Whistle Blows] 
  - [Buzzer Sounds] 
  That's my boyfriend! 
  I'm off my game, and I don't know how to get back on it. 
  [School Bell Rings] 
  There. 
  You no longer confuse me with your she-male looks. 
  I'm gonna donate this to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
  They can use it to plug the holes in their trailers. 
  Sue. 
  Please tell me how you managed to pull off getting reinstated. 
  Well, William, I realized back in my condo in Boca that I had indeed behaved poorly. 
  Riddled with remorse, I arranged a dinner so Figgins and I could have a little professional sit-down. 
  Sue, there's no way I'm letting you back into that school. 
  Mind flagging down that waiter? 
  We had a very frank and healing discussion. 
  And you know what, Will? 
  It was like he was seeing me and my moral integrity for the very first time. 
  [Siren Blaring] 
  So here's what's gonna happen. 
  As of right now, I am reinstated. 
  Or I will tell your wife and the entire congregation of the Cornerstone Bible Way Church of our sexual congress. 
  It's your choice. 
  Smile. 
  - Oh, God! 
  - Okay, look, Sue. 
  If you're back, let's bury the hatchet. 
  I won't be burying any hatchets, William unless I happen to get a clear shot to your groin. 
  You humiliated me. 
  You did this to yourself, Sue. 
  - All I did was enjoy watching it happen. 
  - Yeah, well, enjoy this, William. 
  Now that I am back and my position is secured I will not stop until you are fired and your little Glee Club is annihilated into oblivion. 
  - Bring it. 
  - Oh, I will bring it, William. 
  You know what else I'm gonna bring? 
  I'm gonna bring some Asian cookery to rub your head with. 
  'Cause right now, you got enough product in your hair to season a wok. 
  [Sighs] 
  Hello. 
  - Hello? 
  - Hello. 
  - What do you guys say when you answer the phone? 
  - "What up?"  
  - "Who this be?"  
  - "No. 
  She's dead. 
  This is her son. 
  " O-kay. 
  Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone liked to say "ahoy, ahoy" when he answered the phone. 
  It was Edison who decided that "hello" was a more appropriate greeting. 
  Look, I am really proud of what you guys did at sectionals. 
  But as most of you have realized by now it hasn't made a bit of difference in your day-to-day at school. 
  I have a Slushee-stained training bra to prove it. 
  The fact is, we're gonna have to be better even more spectacular at regionals. 
  It's time for some reinvention, some new New Directions. 
  We need a new hello. 
  Here's your assignment for the week. 
  Come up with a fresh number, but it has to have "hello" in the song title. 
  All right? 
  [School Bell Rings] 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - This is kind of weird, isn't it? 
  - Yes. 
  [Laughs] 
  Here we are. 
  We've been in this exact situation a hundred times. 
  Only this time I could just lean over and kiss you if I want to. 
  - And I want to. 
  - No. 
  Hold on. 
  - Hold on. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  I just need to clean up first, so I'll be right back. 
  - Just hold on. 
  - No, no, no, no. 
  Hey, Emma. 
  I don't care. 
  We've kissed before. 
  Yeah, but you caught me by a surprise sneak attack that time. 
  It was like a Pearly White Harbor. 
  - [Chuckles] 
  - I'm sorry. 
  This is a completely unattractive quality. 
  You are adorable. 
  You're right too. 
  We need to clean up a little before we charge forward. 
  Get the monkeys off our backs. 
  Let's do this right. 
  - We should go on a date. 
  - Okay. 
  Get to know each other as these new people not tied down by anyone. 
  My place. 
  I'll cook. 
  I didn't know you could cook. 
  There are so many things you don't know about me and I can't wait to introduce them all to you. 
  I'll see you later. 
  You two should be wetting yourselves with shame. 
  Glee Club won sectionals and you did nothing to stop it. 
  If you were samurai and my letter opener were sharp enough I would ask you both right now to commit seppuku. 
  In Japanese, this means ritual belly-slitting. 
  We were seduced by the glitz and glamour of showbiz. 
  Let me drop some knowledge on you. 
  Ever since Quinn Fabray got knocked up I've been in the market for a new head cheerleader. 
  If you want the job and back in my good graces, you're gonna have to turn around and listen up. 
  You're familiar with a little Glee Clubber named Rachel Berry. 
  Rachel's the kind of girl who wants things too badly. 
  And what she really wants is one Finn Hudson. 
  I want you to go after him. 
  She'll go crazy. 
  She won't be able to stand you're dating him. 
  Humiliated, shamed she'll have no choice but to leave the group. 
  And without her, Schuester won't make it to regionals. 
  - [School Bell Rings] 
  - [Will] 
  I know it's been hard on you since the baby drama. 
  - I get it, and it sucks. 
  - You seem to be handling it fine. 
  Well, that's because I realized that I had to find this new person inside of me the one that was okay with what happened. 
  I just feel so bad about myself. 
  Finn, that guy who made all those bad choices who ignored the signs, he's gone. 
  This new, more experienced, more interesting guy is here. 
  And I brought you here to introduce you to him, help you move forward. 
  Oh, you mean like meeting other girls? 
  Because I think I'm dating Rachel. 
  At least she sure thinks I am. 
  No, it's not about meeting someone else. 
  It's about being okay just being you. 
  You're a rock star, Finn. 
  You're like Jagger, Morrison. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, I like that. 
  - Good. 
  I want you to meet the new and improved Finn Hudson by singing about it. 
  - Oh, that's why the band's here. 
  - Yeah. 
  Pick a song, and they're ready to back you up. 
  Well, I like what you said about me being like Morrison. 
  And the doors have a "hello" song. 
  So maybe I could find myself and do my Glee assignment at the same time. 
  All right, man, go to work.

  - [Applause] 
  - Whool Yeah! 
  And that, fellow Glee Clubbers, is how we say hello. 
  - [School Bell Rings] 
  - Mr. Schuester, I'd like to run some of my "hello"ideas by you. 
  You're a really good dancer. 
  Thanks, but my feet weren't really moving. 
  - That was the best part. 
  - Oh. 
  Britt and I were wondering if you wanted to go out. 
  On a date? 
  With which one of you? 
  [Both] 
  With both of us. 
  [School Bell Rings] 
  Breadstix, 8:00. 
  Table for three? 
  - Cool. 
  - [Giggles] 
  What did they want? 
  Oh, nothing. 
  Just the time. 
  I know being my boyfriend is a challenge. 
  I'm not Quinn. 
  I don't look like her. 
  I'm not popular. 
  And my personality, though exciting and full of surprises isn't exactly low-maintenance, but I'll always be honest with you, painfully so. 
  And all I ask in return is that you're just honest with me. 
  I don't think I wanna be your boyfriend. 
  What? 
  Rachel, you're really awesome but I think I need to connect with my inner rock star before I can fully commit to one woman. 
  I need to find out who I am now. 
  I'll tell you who you are. 
  You're a scared little boy. 
  You're afraid of dating me because you think it might hurt your reputation though, which you'd never admit it, is very important to you. 
  You hate what Quinn did to you, not just because it hurt - but because it was so humiliating. 
  - You're freaking me out. 
  - It's like you're inside my head right now. 
  - I just see you for who you are unlike you who can only see me as this silly girl who made a fool out of herself in her first Glee Club rehearsal. 
  And that's where you lose, Finn because if you take a second look at me you'd realize that I'm the only person in your life who knows you and accepts you for who you are, no matter what. 
  [School Bell Rings] 
  [Finn] 
  Well, obviously, Hawaiian pizza's the best - because it's got ham and pineapple on it. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Right? 
  - Oh, God. 
  Wow. 
  - [Finn] 
  So it's better than most pizzas. 
  - [Will] 
  All right, guys. 
  We gotta get moving on those "hello"numbers. 
  Who has got something to show us? 
  Volunteers? 
  Mr. Schuester, I think I found a song that sums up my feelings perfectly. 
  Fantastic, Rachel. 
  Show us what you got.

  Guys. 
  Guys, guys. 
  I don't wanna be a buzz-kill but the assignment was "hello. " I'm sorry. 
  I was just focusing on the first syllable. 
  I don't think you guys understand the seriousness of what we're up against. 
  While we were busy winning our sectional Vocal Adrenaline was busy winning theirs. 
  They're last year's national champions. 
  They haven't lost a competition in three years. 
  This is the big leagues, guys. 
  Huh. 
  If we don't place at regionals Glee Club is over. 
  Lionel Richie, huh? 
  One of my favorites. 
  Oh, my God. 
  You're Jesse St. James. 
  You're in Vocal Adrenaline. 
  And you're Rachel Berry. 
  I saw you perform at sectionals. 
  Your rendition of"Don't Rain on My Parade" was flawed. 
  You totally lacked Barbra's emotional depth. 
  But you're talented. 
  This is one of my favorite haunts. 
  I like to come and flip through the celebrity biographies pick up some lifestyle tips. 
  I'm a senior now, so this year's kind of my victory lap. 
  Snagging a fourth consecutive national championship would just be gravy. 
  I'm getting out of Ohio soon. 
  I've got a full ride to a little school called the University of California, Los Angeles. 
  Maybe you've heard of it. 
  It's in Los Angeles. 
  What do you say we take her for a spin? 
  Here? 
  Uh, no. 
  L-I'm kind of nervous. 
  [Sighs] 
  I remember when I used to get nervous. 
  Come on. 
  I do this all the time. 
  I like to give impromptu concerts for the homeless. 
  It's so important to give back.

  [Bell Dings] 
  - Excuse me. 
  We'd like to send these back. 
  - But you ate all of it. 
  Look, I'm pretty sure you have to do what we say and this food was not satisfactory. 
  - There was a mouse in mine. 
  - So we'd like more, please. 
  All right. 
  Hottest guys in the school. 
  Go. 
  - Okay, um, Puck's super fine. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Finn's cute too. 
  - Yeah, but he's not hot though. 
  - He really isn't. 
  - And you know what, Britt? 
  I think that dwarf girlfriend of his is dragging down his rep. 
  If he were dating, say, popular pretty girls like us he would go from dumpy to smokin'. 
  Hello.

  I'm right here. 
  Would you guys mind, like, including me in your conversations? 
  Let us give you an introduction into the way that we work. 
  You buy us dinner, and we make out in front of you. 
  It's like the best deal ever.

  Did you see what Rachel was wearing today? 
  I know. 
  She looked like Pippi Longstocking, but like, Israeli. 
  - Those sweaters make her look home schooled. 
  - [Laughing] 
  Hey, guys, come on. 
  Don't make fun of Rachel. 
  She's kind of cool. 
  - Finn, that's mean.

  Look, I wanna apologize. 
  I realize I don't wanna date other girls, only you. 
  You do talk too much, and you usually just talk about yourself. 
  But at least I don't feel alone when I'm with you. 
  I'm glad you've come to that realization, but you're too late. 
  I've met someone else a boy who's finally worthy of my talent and love. 
  Whoa, whoa, wait. 
  Do I know him? 
  What, is he bigger than me? 
  He doesn't go to this school, and he's a senior. 
  His name is Jesse, and he's the male lead in Vocal Adrenaline. 
  We're both aware that our Romeo-and-Juliet romance will be a challenge but our deep respect for each other's talent will carry us through. 
  Rachel, don't you think that's kind of suspicious? 
  We make it to regionals, and suddenly the top guy in our main competition picks you up? 
  I know it's hard to believe that anyone would like me without an ulterior motive but you have to respect that our love is real. 
  Move on, Finn. 
  I finally have. 
  Mr. Schue. 
  We have a problem. 
  - Finn didn't fall for any of our tricks. 
  - Such as? 
  I didn't wear a bra, and I had them turn up the air conditioning. 
  Ladies, I misjudged you. 
  You may be two of the stupidest teens I've ever encountered. 
  And that's saying something. 
  I once taught a cheerleading seminar to a young Sarah Palin. 
  Wait. 
  We did find out Rachel's with some dude from Vocal Adrenaline. 
  - Name? 
  - Jesse St. 
  James. 
  Ohh. 
  Bringing down this club may be easier than I thought. 
  I'm engorged with venom and triumph.

  Uh, excuse me. 
  Ms. Corcoran? 
  Hi. 
  I'm Will Schuester. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I don't know who you are. 
  I'm a big fan, really. 
  I also coach the McKinley Glee Club. 
  I don't usually cotton too well to my competition sneaking in to watch a rehearsal. 
  But I also have trouble seeing you guys as competition. 
  I believe you have a student named Jesse St. 
  James? 
  Yeah, I think he might be dating one of my students. 
  I'm more than a little concerned with the whole fraternizing with the enemy aspect of their relationship. 
  You think we're spying on you? 
  Honestly? 
  Yes. 
  Noted. 
  Look, I don't stand for any funny business and Jesse's a good kid. 
  What can you do? 
  The heart wants what the heart wants. 
  Sometimes there's that little spark. 
  I'm not interested in coaching just your average high school Glee Club. 
  - I'm driven to excellence. 
  - Yeah, excellence. 
  A lot of people thought I couldn't take nationals with a routine where the kids dance entirely on their hands. 
  [Panting] 
  Okay. 
  Oh, no. 
  I'm sorry. 
  We have to stop. 
  L I just can't do this. 
  Aw, I'm sorry. 
  I'm all business. 
  I'm trying to work on that. 
  No, it isn't that. 
  - Are you gay? 
  - What? 
  No. 
  Because most of the show choir directors I make out with are gay. 
  I spend every waking moment thinking about Vocal Adrenaline. 
  I have no life. 
  I haven't been on a date in three years. 
  - Here you go. 
  - Thanks. 
  I did lie to you earlier. 
  I do know who you are. 
  I saw you at our fall invitational. 
  - I thought you were really cute. 
  - [Chuckles] 
  I know what you mean about being obsessed with work. 
  I'm so committed to the Glee Club and I think it played a big part in ending my marriage. 
  How long have you been divorced? 
  Um, well, I'm not really divorced yet. 
  And then l-I started dating someone l- I really care about but it isn't working for some reason. 
  Oh, you're already seeing someone else and you were just making out with me. 
  I'm kind of a mess. 
  - Look, I don't wanna tell you how to live your life. 
  - Please, be my guest. 
  I think you need to take some time to reintroduce yourself to yourself. 
  You just finished being somebody's husband, and that didn't really work out. 
  And now you're running off to be somebody's boyfriend? 
  Seems to me you need to take a little breather. 
  Look that hair, that dimple, that terrible clunker you drive I think you're about the cutest thing I've ever seen. 
  Here's my number. 
  When you get things sorted out, give me a call. 
  Thank you for the coffee. 
  And the making out? 
  It's kind of hot. 
  - [School Bell Rings] 
  - Hey, guys. 
  Cut the butter, Benedict Arnold. 
  We heard about your new boyfriend. 
  Look, Rachel, we're all happy that you're happy. 
  But we've worked too hard in Glee Club to let you throw it all away on a relationship that might not even be real. 
  Why, 'cause he's in Vocal Adrenaline? 
  Their motto is "Aut neca aut necatus eris" which loosely translates to "murder or be murdered. " They give their dancers human growth hormone. 
  - We're not saying the dude is playing you. 
  - He's playing you. 
  We just think that until regionals are over we can't risk the possibility that he is. 
  None of us wanna go through what happened at sectionals again. 
  Okay, look, Jesse and I might not be true love, but what if we are? 
  I know who I am. 
  And how many chances at this am I gonna get? 
  If you don't break up with him, you're out. 
  But you can't kick me out. 
  But we can all quit if Mr. 
  Schue doesn't. 
  Well, good luck winning without me. 
  Everyone is replaceable, even you. 
  - How could you do this to me? 
  - How could you do this to us? 
  We're a team, and all you've ever wanted was for us to be great and be a part of something special. 
  Now, is that still true or not? 
  [School Bell Rings] 
  [School Bell Rings] 
  You wanted to see me, Coach Sylvester? 
  I did, Rachel. 
  I wanna introduce you to the Mckinley High Old Maids Club. 
  Have a seat, boy hips. 
  - I don't understand. 
  - Well, Rachel, it's come to my attention you've been given the old heave-ho by that terribly uncoordinated Finn Hudson. 
  - Ouch. 
  - And I also understand you have a serious suitor in the form of a piping hot hunk wad from another district but that your fellow Glee Clubbers are so incensed with betrayal they barely have time to apply Freeze Off - to the clusters of warts between their knuckles. 
  - How did you know that? 
  Britt and I told everybody in Glee Club aboutJesse St. 
  James. 
  They're furious. 
  - Lf Rachel falls for him, the club will self-destruct. 
  - Outstanding. 
  On to step two round up a bunch of mustache-sporting teenage girls with glandular conditions. 
  - Anything else? 
  - Sometimes I forget my middle name. 
  I know how torn you must be, Berry. 
  My freshman year, I fell for a boy on an opposing wrestling squad but my team wouldn't go for it. 
  So the next time I stepped onto the mat, I pinned him so hard it ruptured his scrotum, ending his run for the state championship and my run for his heart. 
  To my team, I was a legend. 
  But I relished this victory in solitude. 
  Now I spend my Friday nights making out with my cat and watching Ghost Whisperer. 
  Well, Rachel, if I weren't ignoring what these ladies were saying out of an overwhelming sense of deep repulsion I would probably hear them encouraging you to go for it with your Carmel High beau. 
  Or you might end up like Dottie here who, although her father offered a sizable dowry, which included livestock still couldn't get a date to homecoming. 
  - No homecoming? 
  - No Valentine's, no sock hop. 
  Rachel, you need to become even more narcissistic and self-centered than you already are. 
  Think of yourself, your potential happiness. 
  If not join the club. 
  [Door Opens, Closes] 
  Beautiful table. 
  Meticulous, really. 
  I guess being crazy has its benefits. 
  It's date night. 
  Actually, it was tomorrow, but Will wanted tonight, so I'm surprising him. 
  And I know he keeps a key under the mat. 
  You're really loving this, aren't you? 
  I take no pleasure in your pain, Terri. 
  But I am enjoying seeing Will get a second chance at happiness, yes. 
  Oh, and you're the one to introduce him to this magical new world of bliss? 
  What, you with your three-times-a-day showers and the fact that you can't sleep unless your shoes are all in a row? 
  Is there a reason that you're here? 
  'Cause I'd kind of like you to be gone when Will gets home. 
  I just need to pick up the rest of my Bruckheimer DVDs. 
  Whose is this? 
  That's mine. 
  I got really tired of watching Con Air every night. 
  And Will picked "Hello" as our song. 
  Oh, you poor girl. 
  Don't bother sleeping with my husband tonight. 
  You're already screwed. 
  "Hello"was our prom song. 
  I doubt Will remembers. 
  He goes to the market for milk, comes home with a pack of gum. 
  You're lying. 
  Ask him. 
  Or better yet, go to the library and look it up for yourself in that year's Thunderclap. 
  Sorry. 
  Jesse? 
  Who's there? 
  - I carry a rape whistle! 
  - Just me. 
  - [Sighs] 
  - Most spots are 2,500 watts. 
  This one is 10 times brighter. 
  We have to wear sunscreen on stage, but it's worth it. 
  - I guess everything is bigger and brighter here. 
  - [Laughs] 
  I have to ask you something and I need you to tell me the truth, because if you don't there will be consequences life-and-death consequences. 
  Because if I give myself to you and it turns out that you're just playing me I might die. 
  Not literally, but emotionally. 
  It'll be the kind of heartbreak that girls like me hold for the rest of their lives - like Barbra in The Way We Were. 
  - [Chuckles] 
  Oh, my God. 
  - What? 
  - You're more of a drama queen than I am. 
  Hi. 
  I'm Jesse. 
  I know who you are. 
  You know Jesse St. 
  James, the star of Vocal Adrenaline, your competition at regionals. 
  I wanna introduce you toJesse the guy who's nuts about you the guy who would never hurt you. 
  No one can know. 
  I understand. 
  - [School Bell Rings] 
  - Hi. 
  Hey. 
  I get home last night and it was like some ghost had laid out this beautiful, romantic meal for me - a ghost who wears your perfume. 
  - I was just in the library. 
  Page 42. 
  Okay. 
  Oh, my my junior prom. 
  I wanted to surprise you on Wednesday. 
  Terri came by and, um, told me about the prom, about the song. 
  Emma, I have no feelings about this night anymore. 
  - I didn't even remember the song. 
  - I know, not consciously. 
  But somewhere inside, you're still not over her. 
  We were naive. 
  I think sometimes we spend so much time with these kids that we start acting like them. 
  You've been in the same relationship your entire life. 
  You don't know who you are alone. 
  I think this song is just the beginning of you repeating the same patterns. 
  Terri and I met when I was 15. 
  I'm a different person now. 
  How is you compromising yourself for my crazy any different than you doing it for hers? 
  Well, what do you wanna do? 
  I think that you need to spend some time alone. 
  I do. 
  I think you need to get to know yourself. 
  You haven't been okay with having your own needs since you were 15. 
  You're right. 
  I guess I'm just not good at being alone and realizing what my own needs are. 
  Well, maybe around the time that you figure out what they are maybe I'll be ready to get a little messy. 
  Can you go now? 
  I think I need to close the door and cry. 
  [Laughs, Clears Throat] 
  - [Cries] 
  - [School Bell Rings] 
  Hey. 
  I ended it with Jesse. 
  You can spread the word. 
  I know you know how to do that. 
  Look, I'm sorry. 
  Uh I know this really sucks for you, but I think it's for the best. 
  - Taking one for the team. 
  I get it. 
  - No, not just for the team. 
  For us. 
  You and me. 
  I've been thinking a lot lately. 
  I feel like I have all these problems you know, with Quinn and basketball and girls and stuff and I've been so overwhelmed trying to figure them all out. 
  Then I realized the only thing I needed to fix was us. 
  I want us to be together, Rachel, a real couple. 
  Look. 
  I even circled some dates on your crazy calendar. 
  Is you not being able to talk right now a good thing or a bad thing? 
  - I can't. 
  - Can't what? 
  L I can't be a couple with you. 
  It's the team. 
  We We can't have any, um, drama right now. 
  You know, we need we need to focus on regionals. 
  And I appreciate your offer but in the spirit of being a team player, I have to decline. 
  Hey, whoa. 
  [Chuckles] 
  I'm not just some guy you met at the music store that you can just blow off. 
  I don't give up that easy. 
  See you in rehearsal.
