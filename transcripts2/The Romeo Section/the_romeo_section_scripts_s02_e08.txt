 Previously on "The Romeo Section"... 
 Norman : I think somebody slipped you a drug. 
 Sonya : Why would they do that? 
 Norman : Because you saw something you weren't supposed to see. 
 Norman : What's wrong? 
 Wolfgang : Michael Gary. 
 Harry : A dangerous man with dangerous ideas. 
 Frank : Now there's a hole that needs filling at Andre's club. 
 That club's a good earner for us. 
 We need a strong hand to run it. 
 And I wanted to let you know we're here to help out. 
 Andre's 24 hours in the ground, and you're here looking to pick his bones clean. 
 If you're considering working with Professor Song, I hope you realize that she's connected to the People's Republic. 
 I hope you haven't let her too far in the door already. 
 Let go. 
 [gasping for breath] 
 S02E08 - Complicit 
 [card lock beeps and unlatches] 
 [gasps in disgust] Oh... 
 [curtains sliding] 
 [telephone rings] 
 Hello. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, of course, I know him. 
 Who is this? 
 When was this? 
 Well, when was he discovered? 
 I see. 
 Are you there now? 
 I'd like very much to see things as you found them. 
 Please don't let anyone disturb anything. 
 Has any media been informed? 
 All right, good. 
 Please hold off until I've had a look. 
 Aw, sh1t... 
 Gerard, it's Charlie. Come to the door. 
 [muttering] f*ck... 
 Come to the f*cking door, Gerard! 
 I've got some bad news. 
 Ed Sproule died last night. A heart attack. 
 What? 
 Your cousin, he's dead. 
 Look, my condolences, but we're quite possibly f*cked. 
 Good Christ. 
 What awful f*cking timing. 
 Well, there's a solution. 
 We've got that other guy, Al Crenshaw, we can plug him in. 
 I don't know where he stands on our program, but he'll come around, I suppose. 
 What story do we tell? 
 [scoffs] I think we simply dodge the question. 
 If asked, we simply say that Edmund Sproule was never even in the running for the top job. 
 We always had our eye on Al Crenshaw. 
 Al Crenshaw. 
 The voice of reason and experience. 
 You better put the arm on him pronto. 
 He was found like this? 
 Just like this. 
 Coroner said it looks like a heart attack. 
 A heart attack. 
 No sign of foul play or forced entry. 
 Bloodshot eyes. 
 Autopsy will confirm it. 
 There'll be an autopsy, no question about that. 
 You're in homicide, why are you here? 
 The Coroner says he's a pretty big wheel, might be some scrutiny. 
 They just wanted a second opinion. 
 He was, yes. 
 A big wheel, indeed. 
 How is it you knew to call me? 
 In his wallet was a card. 
 It said to call your number in an emergency. 
 Right. 
 You're with Intel Services as well? 
 Yes. I am. 
 I guess you were close. 
 We were. 
 I'm glad that you called me. 
 May I? 
 Oh, go ahead. 
 Probably you don't want to touch anything. 
 Looks like he was just about to have some wine and cheese. 
 [chuckles sadly] 
 He always enjoyed a good glass. 
 The high life. 
 Rich food, everything in butter. 
 He loved butter. 
 Never put on a pound of weight. 
 Skinny as a rail right till the end. 
 I never knew him to favour pÃ¢té. 
 Is that what that is? 
 I think so. 
 Liver. 
 Liver. 
 Do you mind if I have a moment alone? 
 There are a few things I'd like to say to him I never said to his face. 
 Go ahead. Don't mind me. 
 I'm just waiting for body pickup. 
 Does that mean you're finished here? 
 It's a heart attack? 
 No signs of foul play? 
 Toxicology might prove otherwise, but it's a fair guess. 
 That's what it appears to be. 
 Unless you know different. 
 No. 
 No, thank you. 
 I'll give you a moment. 
 [exhaling wearily] 
 Goodbye, my old friend. 
 Goodbye. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Hello. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Okay, well, see if you can hold him there. 
 I'll be 10 minutes. 
 f*ck... 
 It's a simple f*cking request! 
 I have a right to see the autopsy results! 
 At least tell the pathologist to do the blood work quickly so we know what drugs she had on board, because it's not a suicide! 
 [banging] It's not a f*cking suicide! 
 Yeah, I see you in there! 
 It's not a suicide! 
 Huh? 
 It's not a suicide! She did not kill herself! 
 You hear me? 
 Al Crenshaw? 
 Deputy Minister Gerard Lewis. 
 Edmund Sproule's cousin. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 Oh, yes, Minister. How may I help you. 
 I just heard about Edmund. 
 Are you aware that he passed away this morning? 
 Yes, my condolences. 
 I was very upset to hear about it. 
 Can you give me any details? 
 What happened? 
 As you know, Edmund had been selected for a senior intelligence position in Ottawa. 
 Yes, I was aware. 
 You were our very close second choice, by the way. 
 Very flattered. 
 Can you walk? 
 Yeah. 
 Here's, uh, here's our situation. 
 We need to find a temporary replacement for Edmund, and your name naturally rose to the top of the list. 
 Temporary replacement? 
 Yes. 
 You've already been vetted, it's just a matter of fast-tracking approval. 
 It's awfully sudden. 
 I'm still trying to deal with the fact that Ed is no longer with us. 
 Of course. 
 It's a shock. 
 But you'll be doing us all an enormous service. 
 We can't leave the ship out at sea without someone at the helm, yes? 
 Circumstances demand we press on. 
 I'll consider it. 
 That's all we can ask. 
 He didn't die at home. 
 He was camping out at a safe house, living out of a suitcase. 
 His wife, Evelyn, suggests he was having an affair. 
 Ah... 
 If someone should inquire, and they will, he died in his marital home, in bed, from a cardiac arrest. 
 Is that the Coroner's ruling? 
 I believe it will be. 
 One more thing. 
 We are going to say that Edmund was never approved for the hiring. 
 We're going to say that you were our first choice. 
 I hope you're all right with that. 
 [zipping body bag] 
 Your partner there, he's got a nasty streak in him. 
 Were you aware he bites? 
 He can be a little earnest on occasion. 
 He threatened to expose what he called "my complicity". 
 He does that, and I will sue you both, and your insurance company, for defamation. 
 I promise that's not gonna happen. 
 Did he happen to mention where he might be heading? 
 No. 
 Here. 
 I remember you asking for it the last time you were here questioning my integrity. 
 The toxicology report on the Security Guard who committed suicide. 
 Ah, brilliant. 
 I can keep this? 
 If you promise to keep your dogs off me. 
 Do my best. 
 Perhaps you'll be seeing a young woman who drowned coming through here, if you haven't already. 
 Yes, your partner made me very aware of that... 
 I'd appreciate a call. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 [tapping text message] 
 Sproule? 
 When did this happen. 
 Last night sometime. 
 Alone, in a safe house here in the city. 
 A heart attack, you said? 
 That's what I've been told. 
 You're skeptical. 
 18 months ago, the Chief of the Intelligence Service dies in his sleep, also of a heart attack. 
 The job is then held by an interim appointment until Mr. Sproule won the position. 
 He was due to be installed in Ottawa later on this month, but, as of this morning, he's now dead. 
 All well and good. 
 Two successive Intelligence Chiefs, they both die of a heart attack. 
 Long odds, if you ask me. 
 Then again, not impossible. 
 It's a very stressful job. 
 I have also discovered that the subject of your investigation, Mr. Michael Gary, has been on the short list to head the Intelligence Service. 
 Are you f*ckin' joking? 
 How does that happen with his past record? 
 He was placed there by the previous regime, way down the list so as not to raise any flags, so it was ignored. 
 But now, as the bodies fall, the list gets shorter and shorter, and Mr. Gary gets ever closer to the top of it, so I would not be surprised if, given the right circumstances, with in a year or two, he is the man running things. 
 I think he's pretty well occupied building a private empire right now. 
 These sort of men, like Mr. Gary, or myself, we go back and forth between the private sector and the government. 
 And besides, it's not as if Mr. Gary is a stranger to these sort of things. 
 "These sort of things"? 
 Regime change. 
 [playback rewinding] 
 [rewinding] 
 Lily Song :  Taste that. Tell me if it's gone off. 
 [rewinding] 
 Taste that, tell me if it's gone off. 
 Sproule :  No, that tastes fine to me. Very nice. 
 [rewinding] 
 Song :  Are you unwell, Eddie? 
 Sproule slurring :  I... I'm feeling... drizzly... [groans] 
 Song :  Drizzly? Is that a word? 
 [speeding video playback] 
 [Sproule gasping and groaning] 
 You're a foolish old man, aren't you? [Sproule gasping for breath] You're having a heart attack. Not much to do about it. [Sproule groaning] [wine glasses clinking] [reversing playback] You're a foolish old man, aren't you? Thank you, Fan Fan. Your kindness is overwhelming. Anyone would do the same. To think I hated you for so long, for stealing my son's love from me. Now you risk your life to save both his and mine. How is he? Very weak. He has not had any opium for days. He begs me for it. I'm afraid he'll risk death in search of it. If he pokes his head out, he will lose it. The Emperor will put it on the end of a stick. Where is he? In the shed at the bottom of the gardens by the pond. I will come to see him before you go. I have found a man who will take you south to the islands. But they are full of pirates and outlaws. How will we live? As the traitor and the mother of a traitor, how long do you think you two might last if the Emperor catches you? Prepare for a long journey. I will get what money I can for you. Cut! [buzzer blares] Mei Mei, that was great. Okay, moving on! Mr. Zhao? A guy named Jimmy Wah left a message with the production office for you. Jimmy Wah? Says he'll be on the set after wrap. He left his number. Jimmy Wah? Are you sure? That's what I was told. I really don't f*cking appreciate you coming around here drawing attention. What the f*ck is the matter with you? It's not a suicide. Check the blood work. They haven't even done the autopsy, and it takes at least two weeks to get the tox results, so calm the f*ck down. Sonya Faye was the last person alive to witness what happened at the baseball stadium. She is a complete innocent, and she's been murdered. When did this happen? When was she found? Yesterday. Okay, this is the first I heard about this. I don't know what the Coroner's said, but I imagine he's going to wait for the toxicology to make his ruling, like he usually does. You know what scopolamine is? No. It's a knockout drug. You happily do whatever you're asked to do, and then you wake up, and you don't remember a f*cking thing. Then you realize your furniture is gone, your bank account's empty, and your underwear is around your ankles. So when you do the f*cking blood work, look for scopolamine, or you won't find it. I don't do the blood tests. I am very f*cking aware of what you don't do, my friend. Are you gonna be an asshole your entire life? And many lifetimes beyond this one. I hope you brought a leash. Look, I'm simply pointing out that you should know what you're looking for, so when you see it, you f*cking recognize it! Hey... Like murder, for instance. Please, just... take him away. Easy, easy... Let's go. Let's get you something to eat. I'm sorry about going after the Pathologist. And the Detective? Him too. It wasn't very professional of me. It wasn't even remotely professional. But it was perhaps an effective technique. That's the toxicology report on our friend, Kent, the security guard. Where'd you get this? The Pathologist. Kent had scopolamine in his blood when he shot himself. Well, there you go. Sometimes, you just gotta threaten people in the right way, their assholes pucker, and then they cough it up. What'd she say about Sonya? She'll let us know. This means anything is possible. A suicide becomes a murder. Do you know where my son is hiding? Why would you ask me? Mr. Wah. Tony Zhao. This is a surprise. Welcome. Nice set. Very pretty. Thank you. It's nothing like what you're used to working with. Still, it looks good. Shows me you're smart with a dollar. What brings you to Vancouver? Things are slow in Hong Kong. I hear there is opportunity here. Good tax credit. Everybody knows how to mind their business. Let's hope it stays that way. A.D. in distance :  All right, this is final blocking! Technicians on the floor. The actors can go rehearse. I'm afraid you and I have an issue with Mei Mei. What's the problem? I found Mei Mei at the go-go bar when she was 16. I gave her one look, and I said, "That girl can be something." So I put her under contract. Modeling lessons, acting lessons, English lessons. I poured a lot of resources into her. I was under the impression that it was her husband, Wing Lei, who introduced her to the business. You'd be wrong. That's when she faded. These gangsters like Wing just want a starlet on their arm. They don't understand the hard work that goes into building a career. Not like we do. Of course. The point is, I never agreed for Mei Mei to be in this movie. Mr. Wah, I apologize. I was never aware of any agreement. Let me take it up with Mei Mei first thing in the morning. I remember when you were just a gofer, running around set, pouring tea, selling bad coke to all the actors. And look at you now. That was a long time ago. Not that long. That's another thing I like about this country. There's always room for a hungry man to climb his way up the ladder. All the players work out of here. We supply the downtown strip. Alonzo deals with the day-to-day. You gotta just do what you do, making sure you got the product in stock to keep the street rocking. Let me introduce you to some of the players down here. 
 
 Boys... Charles, this is Rufus. He's our new man on the street here. Good to meet you. Jonno... Meet Rufus. Rufus is gonna be helping you out now. He's the man, all right? And I think you'll be happy with what he brings to the table. What exactly are you bringing to the table? How about a round of drinks for a start? [chuckles] There you go. Welcome to the street. Feels like coming home. Excuse me a minute. You're gonna be on your best behaviour with this guy. Look, you let him get away with taking out Andre, and every goof in the city is gonna think he can shoot his way to the top. You gotta change your attitude. As long as this guy produces, we like him. We want to make him feel welcome, not like he's gonna get a knife in the neck. Lighten the f*ck up. Let's get the money out of him before we throw him away. Your partner gets dusted, you're supposed to do something about it. You'll get your shot. Rufus... Come on. There's a couple guys, you gotta say hello. They got half a dozen clubs on the strip. Do you know where my son is hiding? Why would you ask me? I see how you look at him, how you talk about him. He is your son. I care for him. Do you know where he's hiding? No. Why does my own son betray me? Because you ignore him since the day he was born, and do not let him play in the court, where he might learn at the knee of scholars. But instead, you let him wander in the city amongst pimps, murderers, and thieves... Do not strike me. I warn you. Do you know where he is hiding? I know nothing. He is a stupid boy, lazy and foolish. Why would I pay any attention to him? If you lie to me, I will sink you in the ocean alongside the opium. If you throw me in the ocean, no one will blink an eye. But if you sink the opium, a provocation like that will cause the British to attack us up and down the coast, and send their soldiers to occupy our towns. They will swarm over us like locusts, and then what will you do? I will destroy their opium, and hang my traitorous son from the gallows. We picked up this place 20 years ago. People thought it was a money pit. Now it's worth 10 times what we paid, maybe more. It's all in the price of dirt. [unlocking door] You own any real estate? Just the sand in my shoes. Come on in. Shut that door. Well, that'll change. You'll get yourself a piece if everything goes the way you say it can. I like the sound of that. How good is this dope connection? How long can you keep it coming? Hard to say. Give it a shot. Well, there's a few factors involved we have no control over. For instance what? Pricing? It depends on the harvest. If the poppies had a good year, we had a good year. This year, how we doing? It's a good year. You got an idea what kind of volume you can deliver, then we can discuss a price. Put a number on it. Let's say... 10 kilos a month? Ten kilos a week... Ten a month. Oh, I... I thought you said a week. I must've heard what I wanted to hear. Let's start with what I said, and see how that goes. I'll confirm that with the fisherman. Good. We'll settle on a price, and we'll do the deal. Onto this other business. Alonzo. He's a bit touchy about you taking a piece of the club, but he's gonna get over it, so don't throw any fuel on the fire. You'll get no trouble outta me. I want to make this work. Alonzo's not a bad guy when you get to know him a little. Give it time, you'll see, he's pretty useful. Sounds good. I'm gonna jump, see if I can get wheels under this deal. You know how to find me. Throwing this huge party on this gorgeous yacht. I'll be right back. I've got a buyer for 10 kilos, cash up front, and the same thing every month for a year. Every month for a year? This is real? Really real. You want to tell me who it is? No. And he's not gonna know who you are either. This is good. Yeah. Let me know, we'll make the exchange. Is Mei Mei around? Somewhere, yeah. She's had a big day... There she is. Wait. We may have a real movie here. It could make some real money. Now, you could have a piece of that, or you could do something to f*ck it up. Like what? Like letting Mei Mei's husband, Wing Lei, hear that you're getting tight with his wife, and him deciding to feed you to the sharks in the South China sea for doing it, and me for letting it happen. I'm just gonna say hello, let her know I'm bringing in some of her cash. It's Wing's cash, let's not kid ourselves. And we gotta finish this movie before he finds out that we're spending it as fast as it comes in. So instead of chasing Mei Mei, go make the deal, because you won't even have a dick to wag if Wing gets wise. Tell Mei Mei I was here. [slow footsteps overhead] [footsteps echo overhead] [footsteps moving] [distant sirens wailing] [distant sirens wail, roar of morning traffic] You all right? You're looking a little haggard. I can't get Sonya out of my head. I've been up all night. Candy! Hello. What the f*ck is she doing here? That's the escort we saw at Gary's. I'm aware of who the f*ck she is, what are you doing? We're insurance men... Hello! Hi, Candy. Norman. Norman, hi. This is Rupert. It's nice to meet you both. How do you do? Can we order you something? Yes, please. Uh... Vodka orange? I know it's early. I just, morning is my evening. I'm the same way. Two vodka and orange. For you? I'm fine. So, my manager said this was an insurance claim of some sort? That's right. And you'd be paying for the interview? Whatever your going rate might be. Great. Um, go ahead, ask away. In your experience, as an escort, have you ever had a client encourage you to take drugs during a date? I mean, they always want you to get high with them. You know, coke, weed, smack, ecstasy, acid? Did you ever come across a drug called Fantanamine? It's also known as scopolamine? I don't know. What does it do? Rupert? It's an amnesia-inducing hallucinogen. Like a date rape drug. That's right. It makes you very compliant, cooperative, and you don't remember a thing afterwards, including all the charges you've put on your credit cards. Oh... Okay. I think what you're referring to is what they call "Devil's Breath." That's the one. Yeah, I've heard of it. Some girls might slip it in their date's drink, you know, keep him going for days and days. A $300 date turns into a $30,000 date. I've, um, never actually used it myself. Never used it yourself. No. Do you recognize... this man? No. Who is he? He's not a client of yours? No. He's a good-looking guy. I think I would remember. Yes, thank you. Thank you. She doesn't recognize Gary, she doesn't remember anything about being in his apartment, shooting an empty gun, or anything else that went on in there. What does that tell you? She's being discreet, protecting a client. Please. We know this stuff works, since a thousand years ago. Gary used it on the security guard, he used it on Candy. You don't know that, you're speculating. I f*cking well do know it. Just like I know he used it on Sonya, and maybe even Mustapha. Shall we just sit back and let him perform his experiments on someone else, maybe assassinate someone? What more do we really need to know? There's a right way and a wrong way to go about taking this guy down. Yeah, the right way would be to eliminate this f*ck right now before he does any more damage. That's where we part company. I've got work to do at the university. You need to go home and get some sleep. I'll be in touch later. [locks click shut] [card lock beeps open] [case clattering hastily] Thanks for coming on short notice. Not at all. Let's be blunt, which way are you leaning, and what will it take to put you over the top? Pending details, I'm accepting your offer. Wonderful. So, priorities, what are they? I think a bit of housecleaning off the top, and I'd like to bring some of my own people. Of course. Uh, may I get you a drink? No, I'll pass. You have something on your mind? Yes. Mr. Sproule was handling a bit of business for me. I'd like to be sure it's been cleaned up. I see. I'm sure you're aware of the affair, two years ago, a bomb at the baseball stadium. Of course. The, um, Quiller Inquiry, of which I am the chair, put this affair to bed, but now we're getting uncomfortable attention from a Wolfgang McGee, with whom I believe you're familiar. Yes, I am. He's trying to shine a light upon this affair at a crucial juncture for us. You wanted me to help? Steer him off it. Find out what he'll take to go away. I don't think he's that sort. Everyone's that sort, eventually. I'll have a chat with Mr. McGee. Good. Maybe you can find out who's pulling his strings while you're at it. We have our own ideas, of course, but it would be good to confirm. I'll do my best, sir. [knock on door] Well, this is a rare treat. To what do I owe the pleasure? I just popped by to ask what trouble you've managed to land yourself in the middle of. Is this about Sproule? In a roundabout sort of way. I've been tipped for the chair left empty by his demise. Mm-hmm. And you've taken the job. I haven't decided. Tell me, what is it you've done to piss off the big boys? Well, that's why you're here, I suppose, to tell me. It's this bomb in the ballpark affair. It's a bit smelly, Al. Well, I take your word for it, but... what are the potential ramifications of whatever it is you're investigating? Longshot? Half a dozen convictions of some very important people for accessory to murder. But I don't believe there's an appetite for prosecuting the Intelligence Service. Be a first if there was. So, I don't suppose you'll be backing off. Now, why wouldn't you take the top job? You've been eyeing it for some time. Yes, well, I... I question what good is it I could accomplish. Maybe you could just prevent a few bad things from happening. I don't suppose you'd consider coming back into the ranks if I were to offer you something sweet? No, I wouldn't. Very unfortunate about old Sproule. Peculiar as well. I think so. Would our mutual friend be somehow involved? I believe she is. How involved? Fatally. And I'm open to ideas how to handle the situation, considering the potential consequences of the story going public, for not only myself, but yourself, Sproule, and quite possibly the integrity of the entire agency. You need to get rid of her quickly and cleanly. As we should have done ages ago. Again, I'm open to suggestions. Detective. Ah, there you are. How can I help you? I might have spoke too soon earlier. Oh? I'm starting to wonder if there wasn't somebody else in that room with Mr. Sproule. Like who? Don't know. Something's funny about it, though. How so? The wine, the liver pÃ¢té, box of condoms under the bed. Mm-hmm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's a safe house, is it not? It is. Then what's an Intel guy doing at a safe house if not meeting with somebody? That's a good question. I understand that he and his wife were in the process of separating. I believe that's true, yes. You know her well? His wife? Yes. A little. We used to be much closer, all of us. Has he talked about her lately? Has he said anything about what they might be going through? Eddie did tell me that she was going through a black depression. He was having a devil of a time leaving her, said he was worried about what she might do. Okay. This is helpful. I never considered her in this. My God... Mei Mei! It never occurred to you to let me know that you're under f*cking contract with Jimmy Wah? Don't listen to him. He's only trying to intimidate you. It's f*cking working. You know he could shut this whole thing down. I never signed a formal contract with him. He has nothing. You gotta talk to him and figure it out. He makes my skin crawl. One dinner. Charm him. I'd rather chew glass. Tell him how important this movie is to you, and thank him for everything he's done for your career. He's got an ego. Stroke it. He looked after me for a couple months when I was 16, and now he thinks he owns me for life. I don't want him anywhere near this set. You do whatever you have to do and get rid of him. Mei Mei, I'm begging you. We still have half the movie to shoot. We can't afford to piss the guy off right now. As my producer, I expect you to do your job. Grow some balls. How about that? [sighing] You look like you've seen a ghost. Edmund Sproule is dead. When? Early this morning, late last night. How? Heart attack, they think. I'm sorry. I know he was a friend of yours at some point. Yes, he had been. A very good one. What now? I have a feeling, my dear, that it might be time for you to get out of the game. I once visited a little place just on the coast below Manzanillo. A beautiful little bay, just enough to anchor your boat. Fish, fresh water, all you really needed. If you didn't want anybody to see you, it was easy. It sounds like a beautiful spot. I see it in my mind every single day. Would you like to visit there sometime? When would that be? Fairly urgently, I would say. I know what you did. I saw what you did. What exactly are you accusing... Murder. You poisoned Edmund, and that will all be eventually discerned, but by that time, you can be far away, on that beautiful bay. How? Your sudden disappearance will be best for all concerned. They would find your car just there in the parking lot. You'll leave a note, something succinct. "I can no longer live with what I have done," something like that. Here, they'll find your purse. Along the fence, your shoes. Maybe catch something as you go over, leave some evidence behind. Perhaps that scarf. "Lover's Leap," they used to call this. Sadly, tragedy seems out of fashion. I... can't just disappear into thin air. It's the simplest way. Vanish. You're scaring me. Sometimes that's what it takes. Anyway, my love, it's something to think about. But it's best not to leave it too long.
