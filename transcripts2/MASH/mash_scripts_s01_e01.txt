  Fore! 
  Here they come! 
  - I don't hear nothin'. 
  - Wait for it. 
  [ Rotors Whirring ] 
  [ Man On P.A.] 
  Attention, all personnel. 
  Report immediately to admitting ward and operating room. 
  Attention, all personnel. 
  Report immediately to admitting ward and operating room. 
  This guy's got a rapid pulse! 
  He's in shock! 
  Get him down to O.R. and give him first aid! 
  Let's go! 
  [ Man's Voice ] 
  Dear Dad. 
  Hawkeye here. 
  You said I sounded a bit callous about my job in my last letter. 
  Well, let me see if I can put it another way. 
  At this particular mobile army hospital, we're not concerned with the ultimate reconstruction of the patient. 
  We only care about getting the kid out of here alive enough...for someone else to put on the fine touches. 
  We work fast and we're not dainty, because a lot of these kids who can stand two hours on the table... just can't stand one second more. 
  We try to play par surgery on this course. 
  Par is a live patient. 
  - Clamp. 
  - Clamp. 
  I'll debride the wound, then we'll go in after the spleen, okay? 
  Dish, clean that up for us, will you? 
  Put some suction on that. 
  - Give me a clamp. 
  - Clamp. 
  Wanna play a little "doctor" after we're finished? 
  - Hurry. 
  I think we're losing him. 
  - Scissors. 
  Hey, Red, give us a little cross action here. 
  Put in a fix, will ya? 
  - Everything under control? 
  - Uh, yeah, fine. 
  But if you don't move, I'm gonna have to cut around your " B" cups. 
  I don't want a Kelly clamp, Lieutenant! 
  - But that's what you asked for. 
  - Give me what I want, not what I asked for! 
  Hey, Ginger, put a clamp on his mouth. 
  You can show us all your diploma later, Frank. 
  - That's enough, Captain. 
  - Oh, clever. 
  I can see well enough. 
  Now give me a sponge. 
  - I can't see a thing in here. 
  - Give me the retractor. 
  - Let me have a clamp. 
  - Which retractor? 
  - The biggest one you got. 
  - Get your seams straight. 
  Give me a clamp. 
  - Pierce! 
  - Hi. 
  Pierce, hold on! 
  Oh, lay off, Frank. 
  I just had a hard day at the office. 
  Your conduct in there was not only unbecoming of an officer, it was equally reprehensible as a medical man! 
  Frank, I happen to be an officer...only because I foolishly opened an invitation from President Truman... to come to this costume party. 
  And as for my ability as a doctor, if you seriously question that, I'm afraid I'll just have to challenge you to a duel. 
  Swords or pistols? 
  I was thinking of specimen bottles at paces. 
  There are ladies present. 
  - Oh, sorry, baby. 
  - Major to you. 
  Oh, sorry, major baby. 
  You're both a disgrace to this outfit. 
  Aw, come on, Frank! 
  We've all had straight hours of meatball surgery in there! 
  My brain is sending me urgent rest telegrams. 
  You must be tired, too, after all that malpractice you put in. 
  - You're dismissed! 
  - Thanks, Mother. 
  We gotta get up early anyway and fix MacArthur's hernia. 
  Come on, Mary. 
  Some nurse this guy had. 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  Was that the one with the- - Yeah, right. 
  The one I was tellin' you about. 
  Hi, Ho-Jon. 
  She came to me once with a sore throat. 
  She didn't mind my examining her tonsils, but she didn't understand why she had to take off her clothes. 
  - That's a woman all over. 
  - Best place for 'em to be. 
  Here. 
  Night, guys. 
  I've left a call for . 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Thanks, Ho-Jon. 
  All right. 
  Thanks. 
  - Ah. 
  Finest kind. 
  -Just like Mother used to make. 
  You know, we gotta do it someday. 
  Throw away all the guns, and invite all the jokers from the north and the south in here to a cocktail party. 
  Last man standing on his feet at the end wins the war. 
  You guys got mail. 
  That's Hawkeye. 
  Trapper. 
  I don't feel like mail. 
  Go ahead, open it. 
  They can't draft you again. 
  Bad news from my wife. 
  She still loves me. 
  Would you believe this? 
  She still thinks I got sent to Korea as part of some secret plot to cheat on her. 
  - Well, didn't you? 
  - Yeah, but how did she figure it out? 
  Hey, Ho-Jon! 
  Come here. 
  Sit down. 
  I got a letter from Dean Lodge. 
  - Is that a good place to stay? 
  - Ha-ha. 
  He's the head of my alma mater. 
  Listen to this. 
  "Dear Hawkeye, as dean of the college, I naturally remember you very well. 
  " After my first autopsy, I mailed him a nervous system. 
  "Your request to enter the Korean boy, Ho-Jon, "seems one of your nobler gestures, "and since his academic record meets our requirements, "we will be pleased to accept him this fall, "provided you can get him here... 
  "and also send me $ , tuition before the th. 
  "It was good hearing from you. 
  "If you do to the army what you did to this college, America is finished. 
  Yours sincerely-" Etcetera, etcetera. 
  - Hot dog! 
  - Hey, that's terrific. 
  How can I ever thank you? 
  You just go back there and become the best possible you you can. 
  - I go tell my folks. 
  - Okay. 
  [ Sighs ] 
  Where are we gonna get a thousand dollars? 
  It's more like , , you know, with transportation and clothing and everything. 
  He can stay with my parents, so there's no problem there. 
  [ Muttering ] 
  Maybe we could sell Spearchucker while he's asleep. 
  There must be something we can sell. 
  What does everybody want here? 
  What- What do all these people want more than anything else? 
  To go home or, uh, Tokyo, whichever comes first. 
  - What do they really want? 
  - s*x. 
  - Ahh. 
  - 'Cept for those baseball perverts. 
  All right, we'll have Radar print up some tickets, and you make up a sign. 
  Mind tellin' me what we're gonna put on the sign? 
  "All you can drink, ten bucks a head. 
  "Giant door prize: weekend pass for two in Tokyo. 
  " Lucky winner to share the company... of a gorgeous nurse. 
  " You wanna raffle off a nurse? 
  Is that what I said? 
  Yes, sir? 
  Radar! 
  Radar, don't do that. 
  Yes, sir. 
  You wanted to see me, sir? 
  Yes, but let me say I want to see you before I see you. 
  Yes, sir. 
  You wanted to see these, sir? 
  - How did you know that? 
  - That's why you called me. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  - You wanted me to take those, sir. 
  - Yeah. 
  Captains Pierce and Mclntyre to see you, sir. 
  Show them in. 
  Men. 
  - How are ya, Henry? 
  - How are ya, Henry? 
  That's not what you guys came to ask. 
  I mean, the last thing you wanna know when you say, " How are you?" is how am I. 
  All right, Henry, let's skip the gristle and get right down to the bone. 
  Now, what we want from you is two weekend passes so we can raise this tuition. 
  See, what we wanna do is raffle them off, along with the company of one of our nurses... whose heart and everything else is in the right place. 
  Seems like a good enough cause. 
  Why don't I trust you guys? 
  - 'Cause we're not trustworthy. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, maybe that's it. 
  How do I know you're on the level? 
  Which nurse have you conned into doing this? 
  Well, I haven't approached her yet, but there could be only one choice. 
  A girl with a face that doesn't quit. 
  A girl with so much body, she should be continued on the next girl. 
  -[ Henry ] 
  Lieutenant Dish. 
  -[ Hawkeye ] 
  Lieutenant Dish. 
  -[ Henry ] 
  Lieutenant Dish will never agree to this. 
  -[ Hawkeye ] 
  Oh, but she will. 
  Because inaccessible as she is to everybody else in this cruddy outfit, she's putty in the hands of the master. 
  Hawkeye, that makes me crazy. 
  My lips were made by Stradivarius. 
  [ Hawkeye ] 
  Dish, I have to ask you a favor. 
  [ Dish ] 
  How many times must I tell you? 
  I'm engaged! 
  [ Hawkeye ] 
  I'm engaged too. 
  Think of me as a dress rehearsal. 
  [ Dish ] 
  Always sneaking up on me! 
  -[ Hawkeye ] 
  Who sneaks up on you? 
  - Psst. 
  [ Dish ] 
  You really thrive on rejection. 
  Hawkeye, I'm trying to be faithful. 
  A girl can only take so much. 
  [ Hawkeye ] 
  Are we anywhere near that point yet? 
  You said you wanted a favor. 
  Yeah, I'll tell you after I finish my lunch. 
  Sickening. 
  Animals. 
  Here's $ for Radar's ticket. 
  Ten dollars for the Painless Pole. 
  And $ for the winning ticket. 
  You walk off with this raffle, we're gonna be able to sell tickets to your lynching. 
  Don't worry about it. 
  How are we doin'? 
  Oh, around . 
  We're a little short, you know. 
  Oh, well, we haven't given everybody a chance to contribute. 
  - What are you doin' to Frank's gear? 
  - Selling nickel-nose a ticket. 
  I know he wouldn't mind if he were alive today. 
  What are you doin' there? 
  I just wanted to borrow your Bible, Frank. 
  Since when are you interested in the Bible? 
  I peeked at the end, Frank. 
  The devil did it. 
  Shut up! 
  You get off of there. 
  Don't get physical, Frank. 
  You'll blow your sainthood. 
  I've had just about as much as I can stand from you two, between your snide remarks and your corruption of Ho-Jon... and your-your-your turning this place into a brothel! 
  - Hey, whoa! 
  - Wait a minute! 
  And a distillery! 
  Frank, I'm tellin' ya. 
  You drop that gin mill and your head's gonna go in the shop. 
  Oh. 
  Um, listen, guys. 
  I didn't know it was gonna break. 
  - Oh, that's okay. 
  - It's all right, Frank. 
  Don't worry about it. 
  Don't give it another thought. 
  [ Shouting ] 
  - [ Shouting ] 
  - I thought he'd never leave. 
  Henry, you have no idea what it's like... to share a tent with a guy who thinks he's all disciples. 
  Be that as it may, if I don't do something about this, Frank'll report it to Hammond, and he'll put my butt in traction! 
  And get your feet off my desk! 
  So I'm withdrawing the weekend passes. 
  You can forget about the party and raffle business tomorrow night. 
  Henry, that's pretty regular army of you, isn't it? 
  It's just as well. 
  I have to go down and see Hammond in Seoul for a few days, and I wasn't any too happy about the party taking place in my absence.
