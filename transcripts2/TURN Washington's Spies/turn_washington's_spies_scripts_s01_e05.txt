 Previously on "Turn"...  
 What'd you find out? A brigade of Hessian mercenaries 1,500 strong readies to march to Trenton. I gotta get this back to Ben right away. If German mercenaries are in Trenton, then the British are surely not. Now, don't you think General Washington should want to know that? Marco. Polo. Marco. Polo. You are a traitor and a spy. You believe you should be commander instead of Washington. And I agree. Did you arrange to sell Selah Strong's crop before or after you sought your attainder? All these confiscations achieve is to create more Selahs, more Ben Tallmadges, prolonging the war. There is no war without an army, and Washington's is finished. You underestimate them. Perhaps I overestimated you. Singing "Read 'Em, John" ♪ John wrote a letter and laid it on the table ♪

♪ Hush, hush. ♪ You going somewhere? York City. I feel our business there shouldn't wait till February. Sit, have a sherry with me. Uh, no, I'd rather just get on the road while there's still a chance of making the city by nightfall. Nightfall with the hogs? No hogs, no wagon, just me. This is a seller's trip. What I need from you is a letter from Colonel Cook to get me past the checkpoints. Abraham, no one is conducting business over the holiday. Which leaves us with no competition. See, all the fighting has stopped for the winter, so Howe's entire army is bunkered down in the city. Just think of the demand that this creates. Now is the time to renegotiate our contract. Alas, we've struck a gentlemen's deal with Cook. You want me to give you his letter  so you can sell to somebody else? The army has needs. The city's population will have tripled. Why are you so anxious to go to New York? Don't you want to celebrate Christmas with your family, with your wife and child? Of course I do, but, uh... I must provide for them first. Well, if it's a question of a loan... No. ... to get you through the winter. I don't want... Mary doesn't have to know. I want nothing from you. I had noticed you'd been avoiding me since the fortification of the barracks. "The fortification." Is that truly what you're calling it? I call it my duty and I would do it again. Well, good. You still have your wife's gravestone to tear out. She would know you didn't mean that. Just the same as you saying you want nothing from me is untrue. You want my pass to the city and I do not grant it  because I know that you running from your home,  from our family, will not bring you peace. I will be celebrating Christmas at my house this year, with my family. Don't expect us. (soldier shouting orders) Anna : Please understand, I'm not here to dispute the attainder against my husband or his estate. It is the military provision within it, this Dunmore Proclamation, that forms the basis of my complaint. Please do tell us what fault you find with Lord Dunmore. Not with the man himself. It's just... it's cruel, this business of freeing slaves of suspected Patriots. I am sincerely sorry that you're being punished for your husband's actions, but he is a confirmed insurrectionist, madam, not a suspected one. These poor souls have never had to provide for themselves. And now you give them a mere seven days to prepare for a life they have never known. Were their forefathers given a chance to prepare when they were plucked from the Dark Continent and introduced to these shores? Sir, I have known some of them all my life and... Slavery is a sin,  which is why it has just been legally abolished in England  and, I expect, soon throughout the Crown Colonies. The Dunmore Proclamation will be upheld. The able men will go to New York and join the war effort,  and as for the women, I've already arranged  a perfect opportunity for your housemaid. It's, uh... uh, Abigail, is it? All right. It was your father's. He'd have been so proud that you can read. It's mine to keep? (Laughs) (door opens) Jordan : Hey. You hungry, big man? Eh? You smell that balangu? You smell that balangu, huh? You best hurry before the whole thing gone. Go on. How often must I tell you not to push into my place? You only got about seven days to see what you're missing. Once New Year come, I get them papers, I gone. Then I wish you safe passage. Maybe you're not ready to walk free in this world. (scoffs) 'Cause I won't lay down with you? That's a different kind of walk. City walk. Eyes forward, not to the ground. Oh, you know that walk? I was born free. Then walk free with one of your gals. They ain't important. Not like you. Abigail : Why am I so important all of a sudden? Well, you can read, can't you? Jordan : Don't be afraid, Abby. I know your secret since way back. Look, if you treat me right, maybe I'll stick with ya. I'll protect you and your boy. You gonna need a strong man. My son is all I need. You think you better than me? I never said... Gals like you, always cold. But watch. You gon' end with nothing. Soldier : Major Rogers has come to wish you a happy Christmastide, sir. Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant is his title. He hasn't been Major Rogers since he fought the French and their native allies. Ah, so this is where your commander keeps all his favorite boys. Not bad, Johnny. Did you follow me here? It wasn't hard to track ya. Us Rangers always get our man. Oh, so you found that dragoon you've been hunting at long last? Oh, no, I recall. You came back from Long Island empty-handed. And the bird sings to me that you came back from New Jersey  with a captured general in tow. I should wish to talk with your prize. Where is he? The birds tell me your Rangers have been foraging for purpose, offering to take any task for any sum. For the Crown. Just because you lot plan to slumber all winter doesn't mean Georgie does. Have you intelligence to share? I have experience. Georgie fought alongside me in the wild, not in the dainty fields of Europe where rules matter. Still, when the bounties of his men expire next week, he shall be short precisely one army, and General Howe will no longer have use for the hounds of war. Tell me, Robert, what do you intend to do when this war is officially over? Return to settle your estate? Your debts? Apologies, sir. Your presence is requested by General... Oh, I aim to settle all accounts, boy. Frederick, please show my guest out. Frederick : Yes, sir. Happy New Year, Major. To peace! Major : Tallmadge, on your feet. Sir. Muster out and collect your supplies. Every man gets three days' cooked rations, 40 rounds of ammunition, fresh flints, and a blanket. For what, sir? Secret mission, they say. Password challenge is "victory." And the answer, sir? "Or death." Caleb! What? You know what this is all about? Me? No. Thought you would. All they told me is we're crossing the Delaware. Great. They told us just to follow you. Huh? Well, you're the whaler. As long as we're crossing, he's captain. That's me. So, you, you, and you grab the push-poles. Right, push off! (boat creaking) Caleb : I mean, you ask me, this is just a glorified scout. Secret password, "Victory or death." No, Washington's just trying to make us feel like we're still in the fight. Caleb, look. Jesus. This is no scout. I'm sorry. I was being silly. No. Do you like it? It's beautiful. It's yours. I insist. (Laughs) I couldn't... Please, take it. I know how impossible this all must be for you. I want you to know that I am here and I will continue working for you in this difficult time... Abigail... ... for whatever you can pay. We will survive this. Even when I'm free, we shall still be friends. You're not going to be free. Major Hewlett is hell-bent on making a gift of you to a British officer in New York. I am horrified by this decision. I protested as vigorously as I could. But my possessions and any say I might have had are gone. I'm as powerless in this as you. No, your possessions are being taken. You yourself are not. I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do. Don't let them do this to me. I pleaded with them, Abby. Plead with them again. Annie, please. I'm begging you. If I must go to New York, I will go. But let my son come with me. He can work. He can earn his keep. I asked, Abby. I begged. I'm so sorry. (sobbing) 
 
 (whispering) Anna. Anna! Anna, wait! I need to talk to you. No! I need to talk to you. (sobbing) What's happened? They're taking everything. What? Everything. (continues sobbing) Is it the attainder? (Sniffles) From my father? Look, we shouldn't waste any more time. I need you to do something for me. I need you to hang a black petticoat. Why? The British are recalling one of their most important men, General Cornwallis, back to London. Look, I copied this straight from Hewlett's correspondence. We need to get it to Caleb and then straight on to Ben. It's too late. Listen, Anna... It's over. Washington's finished, everyone says so. That's why Cornwallis is leaving and why this intelligence, as you call it, can be gotten in any local gazette. Anna. Now, go before somebody sees you. Anna, wait. You once said to me, "What are you waiting for?" Well, I'm here. I'm trying to fight back. I'm trying to change things. Things have changed, Abe. It's time for me to leave this place. No, you can't go. What's left here for me? You have a family, a wife and a child. I have a husband in prison. There's nothing you or Ben Tallmadge can do about that. Anna. What is it you...  you sailors say? "Fair weather brings cloudy weather"? Maybe this time it'll be the reverse. Or maybe the fog will lift and there'll just be more fog. We're here. All right, on your feet, men. Everyone, check your flints. Move back, you're tipping her. Watch those arms. Grab that swivel gun! Ben, no! Ben! Pull him! All right? Hey, wake up! How's that fire coming on? Come here, you. You're not going on me like this, you dumb b*st*rd. You hear me? You stay awake, all right? (echoing) Come on! You look at me! Caleb : Know why you can't die? You're still a virgin. See, all you ever done is box the Jesuit. I'm surprised you're not blind. Now, the man upstairs, He don't take kindly to virgins over the age of 20. Sees it as a waste of His good works. (coughing) (Caleb urinating) Hey, Happy New Year, Tall-boy. How do you feel? (groans) Where are the...  where are the men? Right now? Gone. Gone? Yeah. You've been out for a few days, my friend. What? The year's over. Bounties are up. I doubt too many are keen to reenlist. Where were they headed? Uh, Trenton. Trenton? (bottles shatter) Shite! Hey, now, that's on you, not us. It wasn't my fault. The ox moved the cart. You don't look like an ox. Clean it up. (Philomena laughing) I'll show you, Lethario. (chuckles) (Door opens) Who are you? Identify yourself. I demand to know the meaning of this intrusion. Charles? Robert Rogers. Robert Rogers? In the flesh. (both laugh) I haven't seen you since the disaster of Carillon. Oh! (Both laughing) My apologies, I trust that John told you that I'd be joining you, yes? Ah, Miss Endicott, you are in the presence of a true hero of the Seven Years' War. The Indians named him "White Devil." (chuckles) Boiling water, terrible temper. Oh. Nah. It's a pleasure, Miss Endicott. Major Andre was called away by Lord Cornwallis. Yes, that's an unfortunate business. He requested that I ask the good general here... (grunts) ... a few questions in his absence. It's a mere formality. This any good? Oh, very good. Let me get you a chair. Abe : Come on. Come on. Hey, Mr. Baker. Oh, Mr. Woodhull. What's all this? Oh, just helping Mrs. Woodhull. (door opens) Abe : Mary? Shh. (quietly) Where are you going? I'm going to your father's for the Feast of the Epiphany. No, no, we're not. Abraham... Mary, we spoke about this. I've spoken to him. We are not going. Thomas is sick. What? He has the croup. (Thomas coughs) Oh, Sprout. Who told you that? Dr. Mabbs. He was just here. He recommended inhaled steam twice daily  and a warm environment for the rest of the winter. Whitehall has a hearth in every room and excellent servants. I can keep a fire burning here night and day. My own brother died of this. I won't risk our son's life. Well, you'll have to keep him bundled, then, all right? There's a chill out there. Come with us. I can't. This is a time to be with family. Mary, I can't see him. I... I know that you're upset with your father, but think of his pain. He made a terrible sacrifice for the good of the town. Sacrifice? The man debased himself in front of God and the entire town. I'm not ready to forgive him that and I'm certainly not ready to share his table. (Thomas crying) Just go. Go before I change my mind. (Thomas coughing) (Horse whickers) As you may have heard, you are being sent to New York to join the war effort. There you will be assigned to the Black Pioneers and serve under Captain George Martin. At the end of your tours,  if you have served diligently, you will receive these signed papers attesting to your freedom. Take heed. If you try to desert your ranks or flee your duty, your freedom will be rescinded permanently. Don't take God out of your thoughts... (quietly) ... or let anyone know you can read. Yes'm. Mama, please. Hush, now. Baby. Go on, now. Go. Aberdeen will take good care of him. I want you to. That's not possible. I know what you've been doing with the laundry. You hang petticoats to summon the Brewster boy. The one who's fighting for the rebel side. I saw you in the barn that night... you, Mr. Caleb, and Mr. Abe all together like when you were children. But what you're doing is no childish thing. Abigail, listen. They say... I'm to work for a Major John Andre. I will cook, clean, come to know his secrets like no other. Protect my boy in Setauket... and I will do your laundry in New York. Do you agree? Soldier : Hurry up now. Nod if you agree. ♪ Here's to thee old apple tree ♪

Mary will appreciate the quality, I'm sure. Where is she? Uh, she's gone. So's Thomas. They're both at my father's house. Oh. I see. I've never been inside your home. (chuckles) Well, of course you haven't. That'd be forbidden, wouldn't it? Abraham, what has happened? Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Nothing matters, actually, when we take the measure of things, as we're meant to do at the New Year. In fact, let's make a toast. (liquid pouring) To the year ahead. To 1777. How much have you been drinking? Mm, just a little bit. Here, have some. I've come for another reason. What would that be? It's about our signal to Caleb. Oh, I see. Now you wanna hang the petticoat, is that it? No. Well, good, because I burned the letter. You were right. It's useless. So I don't need your laundry line or your sermon or your charity. Shouldn't you be using that to buy your husband's freedom instead? Abigail knows about the petticoats. She saw us meet with Caleb in the barn. She knows he smuggled out a letter and now she's traveling with that knowledge to New York. That is what I came here to tell you. But now I see it was a mistake. Wait, Anna, Anna. Wait, wait, wait. Let me go. Tell me, what did she say? Did she mention me? What does it matter? Nothing matters, right? I don't even know who you are anymore. Look, everything I do puts me right back on my arse. I have no idea if my letter got to Ben or if he got it to Washington or if any of it meant a damn thing. Look, I do want to strike against the enemy. That does matter to me. Everything matters, you know that. You know me, Anna. You always have. Oh, God. What are you doing here? I live here. I've had the utmost regard for this family. Beyond the kindness and hospitality,  you, Mrs. Woodhull, and little Thomas always stood as a symbol of what I came here to fight for. I suggest you join your wife and son at the judge's home for Epiphany. (door closes) I can't make out the uniforms, can you? No. Wait here, I'll see if I can get closer. (guns cock) Victory. Or death. (laughs) You two princesses made it. Yeah. Kneel for your betters, mate. Glad to see you in one piece. Yeah, you, too. He's the one saved your swivel gun. Boy, did we use it. They never saw us coming. Yeah, surprised those German bastards right out of their beds. Come on. (whispers) Christ on a pony. Hessians. In Trenton. Woodhull. (both laughing) Ready for the bad news? Bloodybacks ain't too happy. Cornwallis is camped 'cross that creek with all his boys. Where are the rest of ours? Washington marched them off an hour ago real quiet-like. Took some local cut-through to Princeton. Then what the hell are we still doing here? Look alive, boys. Oh, we're the decoys. General, I recommend we attack now while we still have the element of surprise. Cornwallis : Washington's entire force is stretched along that bank. To turn his flank in this pitch? Doubtful at best. Andre : It must be two, 3,000 men. (men shouting) (Pots banging) (laughing) Lee : Major Rogers...  I'm afraid we must retire for the evening. Oh, no, no, Charles. You are going to indulge me one more time. (groans) Hey. You see, Miss Endicott, I'm intrigued by legends... yours, mine, Washington's. Yes. We established our reputations during the Seven Years' War. Mm-hmm. But where we were... sharpened by success, George was forged by failure. Exactly. George Washington is an abysmal tactician. Always has been. He gets more men killed than any commander has a right. At least he isn't a traitor like you. I beg your pardon? See, you gave up your men for 30 pieces of silver. Yeah. A Connecticut dragoon unit filled with apple-cheeked young boys  fresh from their mothers' bellies,  fighting for freedom, fighting for you. And you gave them up to John Andre. And Andre fed them to me. And we slaughtered them like dogs. One of those dragoons got away. You are going to give me his name. Benjamin Tallmadge. "Bonny Portmore" playing  ♪ Oh, bonny Portmore ♪
