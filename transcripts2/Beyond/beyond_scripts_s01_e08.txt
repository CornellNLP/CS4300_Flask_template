 Previously on  Beyond... 
 What have you been hiding? 
 Anil Vemuri? 
 We emailed about your time working with Arthur. 
 You look just like her. 
 Just like who? 
 Your mother... Celeste. 
 Luke :  Holden drew these. 
 This is where your brother was when he was in his coma. 
 This guy has been involved in youth-based charities. 
 Fort Reed Helping Hands. 
 Jeff :  And it's run by Pastor... 
 Tom :  Pastor Ian Brockman. 
 How much do you really know about Pastor Ian? 
 Stop this! 
 We need to bring Holden in, now. 
 Man :  I'll need men and resources. 
 Shoemacher :  You'll have carte blanche. 
 (Jeff, muffled) Holden, we gotta go. Holden? Holden! 
 (raspy breathing) 
 (heart beating) 
 (monitors beeping) 
 (breathing and heartbeat speed up) 
 (alarms ring) 
 (gasping) 
 (grunting) 
 (yells) 
 Willa. 
 What happened? 
 About 5:00 A.M. his vitals started going haywire, his blood pressure spiked... and he woke up. 
 He woke up? 
 He said Holden woke him up. 
 Willa. 
 Where is he? 
 Arthur? 
 Willa! Willa! Willa! 
 I thought I'd lost you forever. 
 I don't understand. What happened? 
 I was lost 'till Holden woke me up. 
 He saved me, Willa. 
 Holden was in there with you? 
 No. He was here in the real world. 
 But he experienced something... a disruption. 
 Holden's connection with the Realm is stronger than I could have realized. 
 Uh, about the machine... 
 Holden destroyed it. 
 Daniel already told me. 
 Willa. I need to see Holden. 
 Where is he? 
 Jeff : Keep applying pressure. 
 You're gonna be okay. A bullet in the shoulder ain't nobody's idea of fun, but it ain't going to kill you. 
 No hospitals! They'll find me. 
 We can't. 
 We're not going to a hospital. 
 Not after what I saw you do back there, after what I saw those guys try to do to you. 
 Something happened to me while I was in the coma. 
 Whatever you got to tell me can wait 'till after we've fixed you up. 
 Sound good? 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 (grunts) 
 You want to be a farmer? 
 Here's a couple of "achers." 
 Lady : Here's a couple of "achers." 
 Both : Dekker, the next one I'll hurt. 
 (door alarm chimes) 
 Hey, I need bandages... a lot of bandages... rubbing alcohol, some forceps, and a suture kit. 
 A suture kit? 
 Or a sterile thread and a surgical needle of some sort. 
 Fishing accident. 
 Looks like you needed a bigger boat. 
 Um, alcohol and bandages, aisle 3... forceps, aisle 5 and... let me look for that suture kit. 
 Any luck with that suture kit? 
 (gun cocks) 
 Pop quiz, hotshot. 
 You've got a bleeding passenger in that shot-up Sedan, a gun in the small of your back, and you come in here asking for items that could only mean self-surgery, and now I've got you dead to rights. 
 So, what do you do? Huh? 
 What do you do? 
 Are you seriously quoting the movie  Speed  right now? 
 Jeff! 
 It's not what you think it is. 
 What do you think I think it is? 
 That me and my friend are some kind of criminals. 
 Don't tell me. 
 You're good people caught in a bad situation? 
 Actually, yeah. That's exactly what this is. 
 So you're Mickey Rourke in  Desperate Hours,  running from the law. 
 Or maybe you need money for your friend's s*x surgery, like Al Pacino in  Dog Day Afternoon. 
 What? 
 Look, lady, my friend has a bullet in his shoulder. 
 Then take him to the hospital. 
 I can't! 
 There are people chasing us. They're... bad guys. 
 Three Days of the Condor, Parallax View, Enemy of the State?  Which is it? 
 Look, I don't even know half of those movies, all right? 
 My name is Jeff McArdle. 
 I served two tours in the US Army. 
 The guy in the car is Holden Matthews. 
 He has a family in Fort Reed, that cares about him... and... he didn't ask for any of this. 
 Please. 
 (woman stammers) Hands up! 
 Turn around, slowly. 
 Slower, like a snail on Quaaludes. 
 Now move to the counter. 
 No. 
 No? 
 You don't want to help? Fine! 
 But I am walking out that door with these bandages, and the only way you're stopping me is by pulling that trigger. 
 Pull your car around back. 
 We'll unload your friend and I'm going to help you take the bullet out. 
 But if you turn into Dennis Hopper, I will shoot you! 
 I promise you, I'm Keanu Reeves. 
 ♪ He's got the whole world, in his hands ♪ 
♪ You've got the whole world... ♪ (mumbles) 
 Look, will you drop it? It's just a road trip to an observatory. 
 It's just weird. 
 You asked for Beth McCoy's birth certificate and a urine sample, before we went to frigging prom! 
 Well, you were 17 years old, Holden's not. 
 Stop with the older-brother syndrome! 
 What, no fresh-squeezed orange juice? 
 You should be making me breakfast, before I go to work. 
 I am looking for a job. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. I even got rejected by that Fro-yo place at the mall, because I don't speak Spanish... in Kansas! 
 Buenos dias. 
 Honey. 
 Luke : At the interview they asked me if I could be any type of animal, what kind of animal would I be? 
 How is that relevant for frozen yogurt? 
 Are you wearing Tom's aftershave? 
 Oh, I guess so. 
 I just found it in the medicine cabinet. 
 I wish you wouldn't. 
 Mom : Ow! 
 Ian : Oh. 
 Yes, I'm still on hold. Did you find the file? 
 He's a 17-year-old homeless boy, and he has a pregnant girlfriend. 
 I'm his social worker. 
 I'm just trying to get him into a vocational tech school. 
 Yes. I'll hold... again! 
 A force of nature, your mom. 
 She seems frazzled this morning. 
 Just this morning? 
 So, is... this a regular thing? 
 Semi-regular. 
 After you went to college, Luke, your mother and I... 
 You know what? I... 
 I don't want to know. 
 You know, down at Helping Hands, we could... 
 Look, Ian... 
 I respect your hustle to try to get folks to volunteer for your charity, but... 
 Ian : We can pay you. 
 Like a real job. 
 And, if you think the girls at church are cute... 
 You in? 
 Sí, señor. 
 (chuckles) 
 The plan was sound. 
 Might have gone down the same way even if McArdle hadn't crashed the party. 
 I'm bringing them in, come hell or high water. 
 Are you there? Shoemacher? 
 Shoemacher :  I'm listening. 
 I'm just waiting for you to tell me how you plan to fix it. 
 Man :  Holden got plugged. 
 Ergo, we have a literal Like breadcrumbs. Safe to assume they're not going to a hospital. Don't confuse assumptions with facts. I've called every hospital within a hundred miles. No Holdens. No John Does. Sending one of my people in person to double check. Well, McArdle's seen combat. Probably seen his fair share  of gunshot wounds. If he's planning on cutting out the bullet himself, they'll still need supplies. Every hen-house, outhouse, doghouse? No. There's only two farm-towns within spitting distance. Options are limited. You have to ask yourself, "Where would you go if you needed to patch up a bullet wound?" Especially if you didn't want to draw any undue attention. Exactly. And the girl? Oh, I'm not worried about Charlie. I've a pretty good idea where she's headed. And hey, worse come to worse, we know Holden has to come home sometime. How is he? He's in and out. You ever dig out a bullet in your  Zero Dark Thirty  days? Not exactly. So, what, you were just going to wing it? Yeah, I... (sighs) I think I have an idea. You keep fighting. You hear me, Holden? No. I think forceps and bandages are going to be a lot more handy than... Ronin  and  Black Hawk Down? Two of the best self-surgery scenes in the movies. This isn't a movie! It kinda is. (Holden groans) At times like, this I really miss Fort Reed, Kansas. (wolf howls) The smell of those cinnamon rolls on Maplewood Street. (wolf snarls) Luke and I, we... we used to like Butch and Sundance. We'd always freeze-frame... during shootouts, just like the end of the movie. (sighs) I miss him. We'll get you home. Our wizard in the hot-air balloon isn't far away now. Don't suppose there's any chance that your friend's an actual wizard, is there? Just asking. (chuckles) It means "Don't let them in." I hope "them" doesn't mean us. These temples are safe havens. You know that. What's so special about this one? Arthur? I've found... someone. Holden, this is Arthur... my grandfather. Grandfather? I've been waiting to meet you, Holden. I need you to hold the wound open and keep pressure on the top of the leg. Yurek, you're going to take the feet and a flashlight. On my count. You're full of pain killers. Get the bullet out, sew you up and get you back home. Call my parents. Tell them I'm okay. Okay? You got it. And if something happens, contact Willa with my phone. Nothing's going to happen. You hear me? How we doing with the supplies? They make it look so easy. You're cleaning that wound, right? Sorry, buddy, this is going to burn. (dribbles) (screams) Willa said you could get me home. It's not up to me, Holden. It's up to you. He survived the Wilds. Most people don't. Doesn't mean the Realm is done with him. It's purpose is to derail your odyssey. My... odyssey? Death is what gives life meaning. But the two must always remain separate. Wow! Hope that fortune cookie was delicious. My life's purpose is dedicated to preventing humankind from reaching too far, crossing a bridge that should never be crossed. You can help me prevent a catastrophe. Willa : And, Holden, when you succeed, you'll wake up in that hospital bed and you can go back to your life. Back to Butch and Sundance. Okay, so... I'm here to help prevent something, somewhere, and you need a guide? I need to ask more of you. But first... there's important preparation. When do we start? Willa :  Holden finally remembered. He never wants to go back in the Realm. He has to go back. We need Holden to finish the job. Frost is interfering in the Realm, sending people in. He's very close. You mean your former partner? The man you built the machine with? I found the tapes... in your safe. You kept a lot from me. Celeste. My mother. You lied about who she was. My whole life I had no idea. Not even her name. I had to find out from one of your old research assistants. I... I did it to protect you. To protect me? From what? From the truth? What happened to my mother? When your mother went into her coma, the only thing that kept me going was the hope that she might wake up and see you, Willa. But it just wasn't meant to be. Frost couldn't accept it. He thought he could bring her back himself. He attached Celeste to that machine... and he killed her. Isaac Frost is my father, isn't he? Is that why you kept him from me for all these years? I didn't need to keep Isaac away. He never once asked to see you. Lidocaine HCL, a local anesthetic. It should numb the pain. What movie did you see that in? No movie. I'm a pharmacist. Jeff : All right. Hand me the forceps. All right. Now I need you to grab that clamp and pry the wound open. You want me to pry the what? I need you to make the incision wider, to extract the bullet. Just like Josh Hartman. Black Hawk Down. Yeah. Now I'll... I'll get the bullet, and you mop up any excess blood with the bandages. (groans) Hey, this is real life, not a movie! I don't do real life. My friend is in trouble, and I need your help. You've got this. All right. (blood squishes) (groans) 
 
 Arthur : Reach into the flames. Open your mind. Allow yourself to surrender. You won't feel a thing. (whimpers) Ow! (rumbling) You said that wouldn't hurt! You stuck your hand in fire, Holden. What did you expect? Do it again. Is it out? Are you done? Is he fine? Almost there. Hey, you're doing great. (whimpers) (rumbling) (electricity sparking) What the hell is that? Willa : The pain is in your mind, Holden. It's just a recollection. Couldn't you have me just... I don't know... wax a car? Willa's seen you manipulate the elements. This fire is no different. Ah! Got it! Hold down on the wound as hard as you can. Let me do that. I used to sew up holes in my dad's clothes. Okay. Hold him still while I do this. (Holden groans) Holden : Why are... why are we leaving the temple? Willa? Arthur : Surviving in the Realm is more than just manipulating the elements. It's about preparing your mind for the dangers. I've seen those dangers. No. You haven't. What am I looking for? Arthur? (echoes) Arthur? (loud screech) He's burning up. Go grab the ice packs out of the refrigerator behind the counter. (rumbling) (loud screech) (growling and snarling) (howls) (bones cracking) (grunts) (loud screech) Glad to see the kid sleeping. Five doses of oxycodone will do that. You're pretty cool under fire. (scoffs) For a small-town pharmacist. For anybody. I've been in tight situations before. Today, you definitely had my six. (chuckles) I mean my... I know what "six" means. Lydia, by the way. My name is Lydia. I can see that. I'm Jeff... McArdle. Yeah. You said, earlier. And that's Holden Matthews. Who's after your friend? Guys with guns. Part of a cult or... religious zealots maybe. The Da Vinci Code,  or  Rosemary's Baby? I think these guys fall outside the Judeo-Christian spectrum. (chuckles) (phone buzzes) Forgot to call his folks. Told him I'd tell them he's okay. (door buzzer) That's the front door buzzer. I put the "gone fishing" sign up, but... somebody must really want their dope. (phone chimes) Hi, Gladys. I know you came for your medication, but it won't be ready until tomorrow. No. I remember you said Thursday. Today is Wednesday, Gladys. Wednesday? (Ian whistling) Diane : He's shown full compliance with his parole officer. You know what? You've been a tremendous help. I'm just going to call Murray directly. He's an old friend of mine. Knowing Murray, I'm sure he will fire you. But you should have thought about that before you pissed me off! (beeps) Sorry. (chuckles) Sometimes it's like pulling teeth. Thank you so much for cleaning up. Hey, growing up, we had a rule: If you weren't in the kitchen cooking, you were in the kitchen cleaning. I should have that put on a plaque and put it on the wall. Tom and the boys were hopeless in that department. How is Tom? He's fine. He's... it's complicated. He's hanging out with Jeff McArdle now, if that's any indication. Jeff, the war vet. Yeah, he's come to church on occasion. Never says much. Can you blame him? He served two tours in Iraq. Yeah. Maybe he'd be interested in the discussion group. What would you discuss with him? Well, losing his brother recently, he may need to open up about life... and life lost. And consider the important obstacles that come between the two. Sometimes it helps with healing. Sure. I'm sure a war vet could benefit from that. (sighs) Mission accomplished! Spotless. Is this how bullets that go into people normally look? No. Definitely not. Looks like it melted. (keyboard clicks) What if I told you "insane" was working 50 hours a week in some office for 50 years, at the end of which they tell you to piss off, ending up in some retirement village, hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn't you consider that to be insane? All right, Lydia, give it up. (keyboard clicks) What's with the action movie jones? I don't know. Doesn't everyone worship at the holy trinity of Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger? Everyone over 40, yeah. Wait! Van Damme didn't make the cut? Aha! So you're in the closet too. Never hate on the Muscles from Brussels. Ever see  Bloodsport ? Only 900 times! But... I'm not a movie guy any more. Who is these days? My dad would be yelling at the screen, with all this... franchise superhero stuff. They're barely movies. They're definitely not real life. But you don't do real life. Well, real life sucks... most of the time. (chuckles) Holden : Hey. Hey. Hey! Thanks for the backup. You seemed fine to me. Okay. Okay. I see what you're doing. You push me to my breaking point so I'll find my true potential? I guess you've got it all figured out. Look, I say  Karate Kid , all of them. I'm a Miyagi aficionado. I get how this works. What I don't get is what the hell I'm training for! You are supposed to control this place, not let it control you. I could have been killed! If you'd have been killed, then it would prove you're not the one we're looking for. So you're willing to let me die? (rumbling) Do it, Holden. Do it! Let the fire inside you rage. No holding back. Let out your true self, Holden. Do it, Holden. Do it. Do it now. You wanted to lose control... but you stopped it. That's a sign of strength. Yeah. I have to use that strength to go back in, don't I? That's... where I have to go, what I have to face to get home. Quickly now. There's more to do. What about all that crap you said about... preventing humankind from reaching too far? Because, honestly, this... this all feels way too far. Not for you. You're the one, Holden. I knew Gandalf was going to say that. Here you go. (both chuckle) Is it your first time here? Like a virgin. Pastor Ian's a, um... friend of my mom's. Said he was going to put me on the payroll. Wait! You're getting paid? Which I assume you're not. Don't I feel like a total loser! It's fine. A guy's got to eat. I've been volunteering for a few months. My whole family does. My family's group activity usually involves resentment and lasagna. Funny! Not really. You're the one whose brother was in a coma? Ian's mentioned him before, here at the charity, but also in group. Group? Oh. I thought... There's this support group... they're called Hollow Sky... for people who have lost loved ones. My older brother died. But Ian showed us how to transform our pain into something... positive. Beyond this world. Sorry about your brother. That pin? Is that what it represents? Now it's yours. I, uh... I don't... It's okay. No, it's yours. It has special meaning for you. They have hundreds of them in the back room. Here. Thanks. You still close with your old man? My dad died when I was sixteen. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... It's okay. I got emancipated, got my own place. Even got this job. But... you don't have your dad. Well, I've got Chuck... and Clint, and Mel, and Nick. The "Holy Trinity." I get it. Dad loved them. I know you think I'm weird... hero worship, and all that. But it sucks to think that when no one is in control, bad stuff happens. There's no rhyme or reason for any of it. Exactly! Why do I watch the same stuff over and over? Because I always know what my guys are going to do. You're safe with them. I get that. But you... your friend needed you to dig a bullet out of his shoulder, so you dug a bullet out of his shoulder. You don't wait for things to happen to you. Yeah. Well... can't save everybody. That's for sure. I learned that the hard way. I lost my little brother not too long ago. He was Holden's best friend when we were kids. Sorry. No. Me and my bro, we weren't close. He was the good college student. I was the guy inventing new ways to screw up. I... I always tried to protect him, but... bad stuff happened anyways. But now... now I've got to be here for Holden. I'm going where the universe tells me. Universe, my ass! Who needs a higher power? Jeff McArdle and his... gnarly, yet disarmingly attractive scar has got it handled. What's so special about him anyway? Jeff : Still trying to figure that out. Like Morpheus does in  The Matrix. Haven't seen it. (door buzzer) Gladys Feldman must have forgotten she came by. Or it's Thursday. (groans) Sorry, sir. We're closed. Really? I've got this huge headache. It's a migraine actually. Sorry. Can't help you. Try the Piggly Wiggly down the street. (electricity sparking) I will. Thank you. (chuckles) Jackpot! Pharmacy's closed when it shouldn't be. Pill pusher's blood on her coat. So what's the plan? We go in and grab 'em? No. We drive off, act like we're going to the Piggly Wiggly. But we're not going to the Piggly Wiggly? No. We're not going to the Piggly Wiggly. We're going to circle the block and park in that alley over there. Then what? (sighs) Smoke 'em if you've got 'em. Those people looking for you and Holden, I think they found you. Who was at the door? Forty-ish, definitely an early '70s vibe as far as villains go. Glasses, shifty eyes, sweaty brow, and an ugly yellow jacket. Hey. I think he's coming down off his high. Hey, buddy, if you can hear me, now's a good time to wake up. Holden, wake up! Holden! (camera phone clicks) Shoemacher : Cool logo. Is that your company? No. It's not my company. I don't even really have a job. Oh, thought it was some hip startup I should know about. Barista : Next. I'll get a... large Nutella, blended, with extra cream and caramel, please. I seem to have misplaced my wallet. I got it. Ring me up for his delicious-sounding dessert-drink, and a double espresso for me. Thank you. That's very nice of you. It's my pleasure. Oh, is that yours? Smooth! Here. No. Keep it. Put it towards your next startup. (muffled gunshot) (hissing) They're trying to smoke us out. You stay here with him. Where are you going? To find them before they find us. Little hand says it's time to rock and roll. (gunshot) (gunfire) Sit tight. I'll be right back. I can't... I can't do this. (screeching) (Holden coughing) (gun cocks) Where's the kid? He in the back room? (gun cocks) Pop quiz, hotshot. You have a gun on my friend, and I have a .44 magnum on you. What do you do? Lydia, come on now. I tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna turn around, slowly. Slower! Really? I bet you don't even know how to u... ooh! (groans) Is that not how you use it? Hey. Go check on Holden, Okay? Okay. And don't lock me out, in case I decide to wander back. Hey. I think dad would be proud. Yippee-ki-yay, mother... (groans) Yeah. I actually built a phone app in high school. But when I finished, there was already four other apps just like it. Yeah. (laughs) That's what happens. Tough racket. (sighs) I'm stuck visiting family, but... if you are looking for a job, I might be able to tug on a string or two. That's insanely nice of you. Well, what can I say? I like to pay it forward. (phone buzz) Good new? Big contract. I wasn't sure we were going to land. Anyway, I am happy to help. Good luck. Thanks. (dart gun fires) Ow! Jesus. (grunts) At last. (sighs deeply) Just had to follow the breadcrumbs. (body thuds) (theme music playing)
