 Previously, on  Beyond... 
 So do you remember anything from your coma? 
 (echoing) You have to remember. 
 Your memories are trying to force their way out. 
 I'm meeting with Frost. 
 You had a meeting with Frost? 
 Now you have a meeting with me. 
 Jamie, hey. How about dinner tomorrow? 
 Jamie : Dinner sounds great. I will see you then. 
 Kevin's missing. And I know this guy is somehow responsible. 
 Whatever happened to your friend, he brought that upon himself. 
 You're lying! You killed him! 
 The old man doesn't have the best track record. 
 Have you ever asked him what happened with the others? 
 Please work. 
 (electricity crackling) 
 (laughing) 
 Luke : Did something happen? 
 You could say that. 
 Luke : The trick is to sort as few piles as possible. 
 Gray is basically white. 
 Same with tan, orange, yellow. 
 Hang on. Take a whiff of those. 
 Let me know if they reek. 
 In no universe am I smelling your jeans. 
 Ideally, you never want to wash denim. 
 See, they're fine. 
 (washer buzzes) 
 Hey, hey! Removing somebody's wet clothes is like a cardinal sin. 
 Dude. 
 Didn't know bras could look that... complicated. 
 College is all about liberal education. 
 Could be good for you. 
 I didn't even start high school. 
 Dropouts have a leg-up on me. 
 Believe me, you're smarter than plenty of these stooges around here. 
 You should come to class, see for yourself. 
 I can't do that. 
 Can I do that? 
 You're Holden Matthews. You can do whatever you want. 
 Lately it's felt like the exact opposite. 
 See, you need a win. 
 That's what you need to get yourself going. 
 What does that mean? 
 Well, that's the beauty of it. It's subjective. 
 But you'll know when you get your win. 
 Okay, see this? Finally. 
 This right here, this is a win. 
 I... I fell off my bike. 
 Remember, I told you? 
 Stain remover? 
 Yeah. 
 Here. 
 Can't say I've had the pleasure of cleaning blood before. 
 Now puke? That's a different story. 
 You know, maybe coming to class isn't such a bad idea. 
 Okay. Cool. 
 Cool. 
 (upbeat music playing) 
 (singing in French) Are you allergic to money? I beg your pardon? Allergic. Like, if you come into contact with too much, you'll break out in hives. Sorry, who are you? Someone who knows the dealer is sitting pretty on 20. Miss, I need you to back up. Losing with 17 is like the saddest thing I can imagine. And I can imagine you in front of the mirror this morning thinking that's a spiffy ascot. There's 40 bloody grand on this wager, love. Listen, I can lick this plate clean if I want to. That's indisputable. But it's dull for me. I need a thrill. Can I convince you, a perfect stranger, to trust me with his precious money? Hmm. Sir? After all, it is called gambling, isn't it? It's no gamble. You've won. Let's just wait to see what the girl says before we celebrate, yeah? Hit me. Dealer : Twenty-one. Winner. (man laughing) A bottle of champagne for my psychic friend! I'm not some gypsy fortune teller. Then how else could you know what was going to happen? Easy. I was in a four-year coma. (theme music playing) Here, I'll swap out his solution. That's all right. I've got it. I'd like to do it. Sure. Usually start with his vitals. But I'm sure your way works too. This isn't quite the same as Sahin's baklava, is it? With all that fresh pistachio and honey. Remember, I used to say, "Grandpa, I don't want to finish dinner. I only want baklava." And you'd say, "You're sweet enough already, little bird." Wake up and we'll go eat an entire box together. Willa? Arthur needs Holden. In all that time you two are spending together, he's still not remembering. He will. I have faith in him. Frost's man said he recognized an anger in Holden. That it wouldn't be long before he went off like a time bomb. He said it happened to the others. I'm not sure I follow. I need to know. Is Arthur keeping anything from me? I don't pretend to understand half of Arthur's brilliance, but I have seen it enough times to trust it. He's got such love and respect for you. The granddaughter that never once let him down. Don't start now. As Freud says, "We are what we are because we have been what we have been." Now what does he mean? Our dreams represent unfulfilled wishes. When repressed, these deep desires can be masked. But if we analyze... if we listen... they will reveal what it is our unconscious mind truly wants. Yes? What about nightmares? I mean, those aren't wish fulfillment, right? I mean, if an ax murderer is chasing me, is it my secret desire to be chopped into tiny pieces? (students laughing) That's pretty vivid. And here's where the other pillar of our field, Dr. Carl Jung, differed from his former mentor. It is Jung's contention that nightmares are the unconscious mind's way of challenging us. Turning our fear into strength. Don't run from the man wielding the ax. Because he's you. What does he want with me? To the benefit of your future therapists, to be charged $200 an hour to find out the answer. (light laughter) He's warning you're doing something wrong. That course you're on... needs correcting. Now, turning to the super ego... impulse control. Our mind's version of security fraud protection. Teacher's pet. (door opens) You still here? Yeah. I'm wiped. If I don't get a Chai Rooibos tea, my head's gonna explode. Oh, would you please just try an espresso? (phone buzzing) Well, he's still stable. Um... now all I can think about is espresso. I'll brew us two cups, and you can thank me later. Gambler : I don't know her. She won't leave me be! Charlie : Um, no. I gave you one tip and you hounded me for an hour. "Downton Abbey" over here thought I'd put out. She's out of her sodding mind, that one. What has she gotten me mixed up in, eh? And I ask you, what sort of person would do this? Charlene Singer! Oh, please. Charlene is my father. Call me Charlie. Perhaps you thought you could hide or mark cards here. You were wrong. My team is the finest in the world. Yeah, they seem outstanding. What do you want with me? You cleared 1.7 million in winnings. You and your girlfriend cheated. (grunts) No, no, no, no! Girlfriend? Please! I've never saw this maniac in my life! Okay, okay. Alfred's telling the truth. I'm borderline unstable. I've never seen anyone count cards so quickly. Counting cards is a circus trick. I don't count cards. I see equations, broken down to an infinitesimal level. Itty-bitty fractions as algorithms. I take those probabilities and turn them into virtual certainties. That's card counting. Yeah, that does sound like card counting. Sparky's piece is empty. What? His wrist is angled too high. So that nine milli weighs 33.6 ounces. He's 187 pounds. Momentum is mass times velocity. Even one bullet, 124 grains of weight in there, would lower his wrist just a tad. That thing's at full attention. At ease, soldier. Bet your life it's empty? All right, that's about as much fun as I can have for one day. Aah! Wow, this... this place is amazing. No one bothers you. No one tells you where to be or what to do. And at 40 grand a semester, they'll even hand you a diploma. You gotta be kidding me. Yeah, they probably just e-mail it. Hi, Jamie. Wow. She hates me. Well, you stood her up. But that wasn't hate. That was more like, um... aggressive indifference. No, this... this is a sign. What are the odds she'd be here right at this moment? Pretty good. It's not a huge school. It's like the professor said... turn your fears into strengths. Course correct. I'm gonna ask her out. Are you seriously quoting Professor Blackbeard right now? I'm gonna get my win. Just because you're saying my thing doesn't make it a good idea! What's up? Jamie, stop, come on! Please! Holden, look, you really don't need to come up with an excuse. It's okay. No, it's not okay. I'm sorry! I was the luckiest guy on Earth when you said yes and I blew it. (scoffs) Agreed. No, it's just... Look, my coma flared up. When that happens, it makes me act like a real doofus. Like becoming the Hulk, only a bigger jerk. Well, in that case, you were Ultra Hulk. You know about... never mind. The good news is, that jerk who stood you up? He's gone. I've exorcised the demon. Jamie, please. You deserve to be treated so much better than that. Please, can I make it up to you? Look, Holden, I really need to get to class. Jamie. Do you believe in fate? What? Do you believe in fate? Not really. Gimme one shot to change your mind. If you don't have the best time ever, you never have to see me again. (sighs) You just make sure the right Holden Matthews shows up this time. Charlene. I'd love a word. (rain falling) Heh. Take a breath. She's coming. Hey, you're, uh, not giving her this flower? It's weird. What, isn't it romantic or... You look like a cartoon. Where'd you even get it? The bar. Yeah. Okay, come on. She'll be here any minute. Hey, see? Speak of the devil. Hi! Hi. How are you? Oh man, I'm so sorry I'm late. The rain is just a nightmare. It's fine. It's, um... Hi. Hey, uh... Hi! (both laughing) Hi. How are you? Good, how are you? Good. Shall we? Yeah. ♪ ♪ ♪ Don't pull away, don't sail away ♪ Thank you. ♪ Night or day ♪ Do you have your license? I don't have a Blockbuster card. Yeah, neither does anyone else. What happened to Blockbuster? Um, it's in a better place. (grunts) (laughter) Actually, I'm what's called exploratory. Like Magellan? (laughing) Like that, yeah! Yeah, totally like that. (indistinct chatter) ♪ ♪ The world is such a big place, and I'd really hate to get in the way of way of what it has to offer. Sounds like you believe in fate after all. Maybe I'm starting to. Look at that! ♪ ♪ ...hard copy of "City Slickers 2" I guess. Sorry, do I have a booger on my face? I like you. Well, I... I like that you like me. 
 
 (thunder rumbling) What have you been hiding? ...using a combination of light and sound, we were able to replicate the comatose mind. This machine disconnects the mind from its bodily constraints. And it is the destination of that journey where we have made exhilarating leaps and bounds in the study of the unconscious. I was comforted. And felt alone. But... Safe. There was woods. There was thick... It was gorgeous. I needed to leave. (crying) I... I was terrified. (stammers) And it was blinding. I was so alone. Arthur :  It is our belief that the comatose mind is sent off. It travels to another realm of existence. Our subjects each describe, in remarkably similar terms, this place. They draw this. Concentric circles. Scientists and theologians have wrestled for ages about the brain and what happens to it when it fails to function as expected. Does it cease to exist? Is it vegetative? Hardly. We are on the verge of pinpointing that very discovery. (Alarms beeping) (choking) Arthur :  The patient is going into cardiac arrest! (machine beeping erratically) (steady beep) We will need to recalibrate our approach, Dr. Frost. Dr. Frost. Frost was... Arthur's partner? ♪ The heat of the moment ♪ 
♪ Telling me what your heart meant ♪ 
♪ The heat of the moment ♪ 
♪ That shone in your eyes ♪ All yours. Hey. You're on deck, big guy. Come on. Pick a song. Look, can I just work up to it? Okay, look. I didn't wanna have to resort to this, but you stood me up. Yeah, man, she's got a point. Mm-hmm. Okay. Are you a betting man? I'm listening. I will randomly pick a song with my eyes closed. No cheating. If you know the song, then we sing. Hmm. We'll let fate decide. You're on. ♪ Do-do-do-do! ♪ (all laughing) "Call Me Maybe." Oh gosh. We sang that like a million times freshman year, right? Yeah. Well, um... I think, you, uh... meant to stop there. Hmm? ♪ Games, changes and fears ♪

♪ Goodbye, and I choke ♪ (microphone feedback) (growling, barks) (muffled) Hey. Are you okay? Jamie : Holden? (wolf barks) I gotta go. Holden! (panting) Hey! Slow down! (train horn in distance) I'm sorry, I just... I had to get out of there, and I... Okay, okay, that's okay. We can... We can stay out here as long as you need. No, look, tonight had to be perfect. That's what I promised you and I... oh! No, you promised me a great time, and you delivered. I shouldn't have pushed you. No, that other Holden, the one I thought was long gone? It turns out he's more persistent than I thought. Okay, um... it's okay. Just... talk to me. Look, I can't. I... No, I want to, it's just, I... I think I need a minute alone. All right? I think you need more than a minute. No, I... I... what are the odds of a second second chance to make this work? That bad, huh? You shouldn't have to make this work, Holden. You can't force fate. Take care of yourself. (sighs) (horn honks) (tires screech) Kid, are you okay? Hey, kid? You all right? (wolf snarling) (screaming) (wolf whimpers) Get up! Get to the temple. They can't follow us. We'll be safe in there. (growling) (barks) (snarls) (grunts) (rumbling) That's how we met. How we met? I could've killed you! You need help. I need Willa. Ow, ooh! Oh. Damn crazy kid. That was your fault! You gotta learn to be more careful. Holden! Hey, are you okay? Did you just get hit by that car? It's fine. Everything's fine. I gotta see about a girl. It's too late, man. Jamie's gone. No, I know. Not her. It's... it's not too late for this one. What, there's another one? Where are you going? (crowd shouting) (grunts) (grunting) Ten grand on homie in red. Your friend want a taste too? She's Mormon. 15 grand. On white. Watching two men pummel each other to death just screams your wheelhouse. Hollow Sky has been alerted to a young man with special abilities. A compatriot. Fellow Realm freak. I hope not quite like you. Word is, he's powerful. Turned an MRI machine into the Fourth of July. Dr. Frost believes he's powerful enough to cross the Bridge. The Bridge is a myth you all push to keep the bills paid. Be that as it may, Frost insists on having an audience with this young man. Frost believes he will help bring Hollow Sky into a new stratosphere. Your services are required. This young man can trust you. He can relate to you. I don't relate to me. Is this really the best use of your prodigious talents? Yeah, actually, and how many times can I tell you and your pie-in-the-sky organization to get bent? I've lost count. (scoffs) (crowd cheering) You're gonna wanna pay up that 15 grand now. Maurice gets a little bit stabby when you hold out on him. Look, you want him so bad? Go scoop him up yourself. Lord knows you've got resources out the wazoo. This case is more delicate. Why is that? Because Arthur got to him first. Arthur? Perhaps you'd be interested in making a trade? What's Boy Wonder's name? ♪ ♪ (both panting) What is this place? It's a safe haven. No, I mean where... where are we? Am I dead? You're far from it. You're alive in a way few people ever get to experience. Ow! Mmm! This isn't a dream either, is it? No. (exhales) Figured. Traditionally dream injuries don't hurt like... ow! Careful. Sorry about that. That thing I did outside, with the wolf and the... (mimics explosion) and the... if this isn't a dream, how was that even possible? The reason you were able to do what you did... it's because of this place. I think it agrees with you. (splashing water) There. You're good as new. Better than new. What is it? Nothing. I just, um... I thought I was alone in here. You're not alone. Not anymore. I'm Willa. Holden. I'm really glad I found you, Holden. Me too. (car passes) (pounding on door) ...  pinpointing that very discov... Holden, I didn't know you were... (breathing hard) What is it? What's wrong? I'm really glad you found me. You remembered. (both kissing, moaning) The frozen mountain when the ravens attacked, do you remember? No, not exactly. What about... what about the sinkhole, when we fell in? Vaguely. What about the time... Willa! It's you. Okay? That's what I remember. No, I don't totally understand it, but, look, I know that we had something. That's what matters. Ow! Oh! What happened to you? I... I got hit by a car. It's fine. It... helped me remember you. Oh. Why didn't I think of that? Willa, I... I know him. Oh. That's Arthur. I've been seeing him everywhere since I woke up. (sighs) That's because... That's because he trained you and now he needs your help. Wait, wait. Well, can you take me to see him? Can we... Can we see him? Right now? Um, yeah. Yeah, of course. (ice clatters) (indistinct chatter) Riley : Hello? Still me. Why are you so quiet? Am I being quiet? Holden will be fine. You don't think it's strange he just up and left tonight? Lots of things about your brother are strange. Do you need to say that? He's trying. Yeah, I heard the song. (pills rattle) It's just... hey, the blood on his jacket... and the running off-stage? He gets hit by a car and immediately goes off to see some other girl? I mean, stop me when any of this sounds normal. No. What are you saying? (sighs deeply) That I... I don't think he's ready to live back in the real world. (footsteps approach) (monitors beeping) If there's a family of cannibals in that room, I'm taking back all the nice things I said about you. Look... Arthur invested everything into this. We all have. And I was getting worried you wouldn't remember what you'd have to do. (door opens) He can't be here. Get away from him! It's you. Daniel, this is Holden. He's here to help. Hi. Hi. What is it, specifically, you need me to do to help him? He doesn't remember. He does. We're just figuring out the best recourse... and that means going back in. In? As in... Are you gonna put me in a coma? No, no. No coma. There's another way. Holden : What happened to him, anyway? Arthur spent years traveling back and forth. That's when he was with you, teaching you. But he got stuck and soon after, he became unresponsive. Soon after what? After you woke up. (rock music playing) (woman sings in French) (people speaking French) (Music continues over speakers) Woman on video :  For 12 years, Holden Matthews has laid at County Hospital in one of the longest-recorded comas in history. And today, that streak has finally come... Four thousand, three hundred some odd days in a coma? (woman speaking indiscernibly) Holden Matthews, maybe you are something special. (voices on computers overlapping) (exhales) (music continues) (woman and man singing in French) (voices getting louder) (voices stop) (muffled music playing) (breathing hard) (gags, retches) (sighs) (chuckles) (beeps) (machine humming) (electricity crackling) (wind howling) (humming continues) (wind howling) (humming continues) (wind howling) (humming continues) (humming continues) (clanking) Willa : It's powering itself up. I've never seen it do that before. You're connected to this machine. Just like you are to the Realm. I can feel it. So, you... think I'm the only one who can get this thing to work? I've exhausted it myself. I'm missing something. (wind howling) (ground cracking) Holden! Oh! Oh! No! Oh my god! Hey. Don't worry. I've got you. Ah! Don't let go! Don't let go! Hey. (grunts) (screams) No! (machine humming) (clacking) You should stand back. (door closes) (grunting) Holden, stop! Oh! Holden, please stop! What are you doing? No! (screams) Stop! Please! (shouts) (whirring slowing) What did you do? That machine was our only way back! Exactly. We're never going back. What? No, Holden, you don't understand! No, I understand perfectly! I had you, and then you were gone. I won't risk that ever again. (theme music plays) (theme music plays)
