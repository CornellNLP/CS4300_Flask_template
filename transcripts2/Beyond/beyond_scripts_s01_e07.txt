 Previously, on  Beyond... 
 Hollow Sky's been alerted to a young man with special abilities. 
 Your services are required. 
 Am I the first girl to be brought up to your bedroom? 
 One of the gazillion things I missed was... hangin' out with girls. 
 There, I said it. 
 The people that killed my brother are after your son. 
 I need your help. 
 Ian agreed to wait up for Holden with me. 
 That's a kind gesture. Doesn't go unnoticed. 
 I know we had something. That's what matters. 
 It's not just about us. 
 It was all so I could go back in. 
 For him, for Arthur? 
 It's complicated. Let me know when you un-complicate it. I'm looking for Holden. He's not here. This is my number. Could you tell him to call me? The year I went into my coma, I was supposed to visit  this telescope in Colorado. Of course I never got to see it. Wait, is it the emperor or the prince in the carriage? The prince, c'mon. Keep up. Okay. So the... the prince is traveling through the countryside? In disguise, yeah. He wants to see how common folk will treat him, if they don't know he's royal blood. But what he realizes is he actually likes being special. Problem is, by the time he returns to the Forbidden City, his father, the emperor, had died, and no one will recognize him as the crown prince. So he has to just go on living the rest of his life as a regular Joe... er, Xiao. I feel like I'm supposed to be taking something from this. You say you want a normal life. I do wanna have a normal life. Nobody wants to have a normal life. And what... what the hell is normal anyway? For starters, not... going into a 12-year coma. Not... setting houses on fire with my mind. Or... Super powers? 'Cause you're special. I'm not special and they're not... super powers. Okay, what would the normal 25-year-old Holden Matthews be doing in his normal life right now? I would... you know, graduated college. Have a job. Building telescopes. You know and... maybe even build one to send to outer space like the Hubble. I... I built a telescope when I was 13, the summer before. God, when you talk like that, all enthusiastic and smart, I... I just... I just wonder is there really no limit to your space nerdiness? (laughs) Thanks. Oh, my God, did you see that milkshake? You want one? Oh... yes! No, no! It's... it's like a million calories. Don't think you have to worry about calories. You haven't seen me naked. (country music playing) So... speaking of not-normal, I dare you to totally blow these normal people's minds right now. And how would I do that? Do something subtle, like, change the god-awful music on that jukebox. ♪ Leather lover ♪ (strumming banjo) C'mon. Let's get psionic up in this bitch. Okay. Okay. Remember, focus on a specific point. Stare inside it. Shh! I'm workin' on it. (country music playing) ♪ He got squinty eyes and suntan cheeks ♪ 
♪ Rides a rough out Wade with a bucket seat ♪ (crackling noises) (country singing continues) (rattling noises) ♪ He's a shadow ridin' fool ♪ 
♪ Stay outta his way ♪ (speed slows down) (jukebox turns off) (crickets chirping) (customers murmuring) Oh, yep, we should bounce now. Holden : Go, go... go, go! (Charlie laughing) Oh, my God, that was amazing! I was trying to change the music, not cause a blackout! Blackout's way better, dude! Got you somethin'. C'mon, you know you want it. Couple sips is only like 25,000 thousand calories. Mmm! ♪ Leather lover ♪ Let's go! (electrical vibration noises) So he just lit out in the middle of the night? It wasn't the middle of the night. He asked if they could go and I said yes. What's at Mt. Remick? 350 miles away. Remember that observatory that he talked nonstop about when he was a kid? Who's the girl? Charlie, she's very sweet. Who... who's Charlie? Apparently your brother took off on a road trip with some girl named Charlie. Huh. Yeah, first it was Jamie and then Willa, and... Who's Jamie? Who's Willa? Or was it Willa first? So, what, you just let him leave, Mom? I didn't just let him leave, he's 25 years old. We gave him a truck. Which needs a new timing chain. And I'm not gonna stop him from catching up on some of the things that he missed. I worry about him, too. I'm really late for work. That is old. (ringing bell) Do you have a reservation? No, uh... is that a problem? Oh... I just got a cancellation on Cabin 4. Great! Um... we'll take it. If you don't, somebody else will! (laughs) If you could just sign my ledger here, Mr. and Mrs.... Charlie : Matthews. Mr. and Mrs. Holden Matthews. Of Fort Reed, Kansas. We're newlyweds. Kansas, huh? Beautiful country. You been? No. Uh, but my sister-in-law... my former sister-in-law... she spoke very highly of the Buckeye State. Jayhawk State. Come again? Nothing. Um... the cabin, it's, uh... it's got two beds? Why would we need two beds, dear? Unless you're expecting company on our honeymoon? (laughs) (laughing) (cell phone vibrates) (laughing) Um... Boy, she's funny. She's... she is great, um... What do you want? Shoemacher :  You don't call,  you don't write. How's our project coming along? I don't... I don't know what you think Holden can do, or what Frost wants with him, but... I've been looking over my shoulder ever since I woke up, and I'm not gonna do that to Holden. I shoulda told you in Monte Carlo what I'm telling you now: you can go... (car alarm sounds) You like him. How adorable. But that doesn't change our deal. You help bring in Holden, and we help you get Arthur. Arthur will get what's coming to him, Holden or no Holden. You might want to rethink your position. Oh, is this where you tell me that you'll get your hooks in Holden with or without my help? No. This is where I tell you a story about a bright 15-year-old in Oregon, named Annabelle. I... I don't... I don't know who that is. You don't remember the foster sister you befriended back in the day? You are still paying for her posh boarding school, aren't you? Stay away from Anna.  I would hate to see her thrust you're so familiar with. I will kill you! I will destroy Hollow Sky, I will burn down the entire building and everybody in it! Now, Charlie, is that any way for you to talk to an old... (phone beeps off) God... dammit! Ohhh! God! Sorry if I sounded distracted, I... I can't say I expected your call. Can't really say I... expected you to answer. Is everything okay... with Holden? I don't... know... how to say this, so I'm... I'm just gonna say it. Who the hell are you, and... and what do you want with my brother? Me, I... we're just friends. See, uh... I can tell a bad liar from a good liar. And you're terrible. Look, I'm helping with Holden's rehab. Holden quit physical therapy weeks ago. Do you wanna go for strike three, or do you just wanna skip to the truth? Holden drew these, and... and you know what they are. Don't you? This... is where your brother was... when he was in his coma. (scoffs) Wh... what are you...? But that's crazy. Sounds crazy, but... more than that, you need to ask him. I'm sorry. (crickets chirping, people murmuring) So what're we looking for? The main event is Mercury in retrograde. It'll look like the planet is actually moving backwards. But it's... not? No, but it does slow down. See, it's the only planet whose orbit speed changes, so, Earth is moving the same speed while Mercury slows down, so it seems like it's moving... backwards. Ohh. Okay. C'mere. Take a look. Okay. (clears throat) Look for the brightest object in the sky above the moon. Oh, yeah, I see it. I... I think, maybe. Maybe. Uh... Don't worry. Once we go inside and look through the big telescope, it'll be like we're looking right out the window. Then what are we doing out here with this rinky-dink telescope? You mean the telescope I made? Uh-oh. Hi, excuse me? Uh, we wanted to check out the Cassegrain telescope inside, is there... a line or a sign-in sheet? Unfortunately, we retired the 1/2 meter reflector from the public use about three years ago. Okay, wait, wait... wait, wait... hold... hold on... Brett. My friend was supposed to come here in eighth grade, but he never made it to eighth grade, because he... fell off his motorcycle, and went into a 12-year coma, and now he's awake, and we came all the way from Kansas so he could see Mercury through your big telescope. Really? I'm serious! He was in a coma! Yeah, sorry. Holden : Wow. My motto is, ask forgiveness, not permission, and don't ask for forgiveness either. We're totally gonna get caught. (Holden exhales) Holden : Cool, huh? Dome's closed. That's why we're gonna open the dome. Okay, there must be a, uh... Ah! There it is! Here. Thank you. Is that gonna make noise? I don't know. Oh, yeah, we're totally gonna get caught. Yes! Wicked good. We're in luck. It's mostly pointed in the right direction, I think. Oh... this... this is amazing, it's right there, here... take a look! Wait... oh m... I can see it! It's very slow, but it should look like it's moving backward. Oh, my God! You know, according to superstition, a... a retrograde Mercury brings bad luck, and can totally screw up your love life. What are you saying? You and me aren't gonna fall into orbit? (heavy door opening) Employee : Hello? Hide! Here! Down! (Charlie giggles) Someone in here? (loud switch thrown) Door. Door, go! Employee : Hey! (Charlie giggles) Holden : Go, go, go, go, go! (Charlie giggles) Well, it's Mediterranean contemporary. It's open concept, Brazilian cherry hardwood floors throughout. Walk-in wine cellar, gourmet kitchen with granite countertops... How are the schools? Great. This is a gated community, so, you know, inside these walls, you're as safe as milk. You folks are pre-approved, right? Oh, yeah, uh... he just got a big bonus from the home office. Plus a little extra for getting banged up on the job. Which I'm sure you noticed. Golden handcuffs are more like it. Indefinite paid leave. (phone vibrates) Excuse me for a second. Here. So what do you think? It's pretty nice, huh? Well, it's on a golf course. What do you think, Spartacus? Hmm? Oh... you love it just like Mama, don't you? Hmm? Yes, yes you do. Why don't I show you the upstairs? There's a gorgeous master suite, his and her walk-ins... Melanie : Sorry, he's, uh, a little cranky. Sitting around the house doesn't suit him. Well, Spartacus... this ain't our world, pal. (dog whimpers) It won't work if you don't focus. I am focusing. Or trying to. We've been sitting here for 10 minutes and the lamp is still off. You were the one bragging about how you could help me with my... Mmm, but I'm not gonna say it. Powers! Okay, let's... let's recap, how were you able to survive in the realm for so long? Apparently I could manipulate the elements. So now in the real world, our theory is I'm... tapping into atmospheric electricity. Our theory? Willa. I... I mentioned her to you, she, uh... was helping me. Yeah, Willa and uh, and Arthur, was it? Yeah. He sounds like a real peach. Well, the whole... electricity in the air thing is just a guess. You were different when you came out, too. Right, but it's linked is what I'm saying. I survived by being totally OCD, charting storms and antibodies, and then... bam! I wake up from my coma, and I can see patterns and algorithms. And after a lot of practice... I learned to use those powers to my advantage. I know, but I don't even want my... powers. See, that's your problem. You have to embrace what you are. Have fun with Holden 2.0. But first, turn on the damn lamp. Okay. (buzzing) (bulb explodes) At least I turned it on. Yeah, for a second. (exhales) You're unhappy we took you off the Matthews case. I get that. And you and I haven't always seen eye to eye on operational matters. But maybe, we need each other. What happened with the kid? Decision was made to bring in a freelancer. To convince Holden to meet with Frost. But... the thinking was maybe... maybe someone more like him. Charlie Singer. You sent that nutjob after Holden? It wasn't my decision. But Frost is the boss. From the jump, I said we needed to bring that kid in, by any means necessary. You did. But I told you so doesn't change the facts on the ground. We need to bring Holden in now. We're back to "we." I'm offering you an escape hatch from all... this. And I'm big enough to admit that you're the best man for the job. Are you big enough... to accept? I'll need men and resources. You have carte blanche. I went crazy when I first woke up. And then I realized what I could do. I'm not saying some of what I can do isn't cool, it's just... That you wanna be normal. That's a pipe dream. What? 
 
 Man : Hey! Hi! You two in the cabin next door? Um... yeah. Are you having electricity issues? Our TV went out. Yeah. Really? That's... so... weird! What are we doin' watchin' TV with all this beautiful scenery anyway, eh? (laughs) Phil Ferris. My better half, Helen. Hi, um, Holden. Matthews. And this is my, my wife. Charlie. We're from Kansas. We're down from Canada ourselves. Few days away from the kids. Two little terrors. I mean angels straight from heaven. (laughing) Can I see pictures? Oh, you don't have to be polite, but, of course. I'm not tryin' to drum up business, promise. Oh, they're so cute. Insurance? Wow, that sounds, um... Incredibly boring, I know. (laughing) But it pays the bills, right? That little one looks like trouble. There you go, that, uh... that works. (phone rings) Hey, Steve. Yeah, I'm just finishing up those turbine engine bits as we speak. I'll send 'em out to you in about five minutes. You got it. Bye. Sure you should be sneakin' outta work to come meet with me? You said you had something for me. What is it? What is this? Tax returns. On paper, all those guys are religious work, right? Thing about religion nowadays? Even the Pope has a Twitter account. But these guys, no publicity, no social media. Now... now there's chatter on the dark net about a guy named Isaac Frost. All right, so what does Hollow Sky or this Frost guy want with Holden? Maybe nothin' but... How the hell did you get this? Hollow Sky has been stockpiling assets. Liquid and real estate. And they've also been involved in philanthropy... youth-based charities. One of them's right here in our backyard. "Fort Reed Helping Hands." Yep. And it's run by... Pastor Ian Brachman. Son of a bitch is dating my wife. Sure you don't wanna come? Oh, I'm gonna be up late catching up on work as it is. Well, we could stop at that diner. With the giant homemade cinnamon rolls. Don't tempt me. Please don't take this the wrong way, but regional pastor meetings aren't exactly my idea of fun. (laughs) Me either. It's my monthly penance. Mm. Thank you. So have you heard from Holden? Oh, he's having fun. He... he... he saw Mercury rising or... something last night. He was so excited. Luke : Holden called? Yep. What? I sent him like four text messages. 'Sup Ian? Oh, same old. I heard you took a sabbatical from school. Uh, just a semester off, you know, I couldn't focus. I was worried about my big brother. Hm. I hope all those long hours on the couch watching  Family Feud  are helping you cope. Okay. Uncle Steve gets me through the day. So does a job. Yeah... okay... I'm looking for a job, and... and it's just a semester. We can always use some helping hands down at the Youth Center. Because the Youth Center is called "Helping... "Hands." Yeah, I, uh... I got it. Thanks, Preach, but um... I gotta go. Charlie : What's with the life jackets? I signed us up for that canoe trip. There are no snakes, are there? No. Cottonmouths, maybe, though. No. Maybe pythons. No. You guys bravin' the rapids? Uh, yeah, that's the idea. Is that fly fishing gear? Yes, indeed. Uh, you guys wanna come with, Ill show you the ropes. Uh... you know, thanks, for the offer, I... I think we're gonna chart our own course. Okay. No problem. You clearly wanted to go. And you clearly didn't, it's... it's fine. Well... friends aren't really my thing. Most guys would've just done what they wanted to do. I guess I'm not... most guys, then. No, you're not. Yo, wait up. We'll tag along. Come on. We're coming! (Charlie laughs) (laughing) Helen moved to my high school in grade eleven. That first day I was like, "Who is she?" That's a good one. But, uh, I did what any red-blooded 16-year-old would... He stalked me after school. I followed her... a little too close, because I rear-ended her at a traffic light. Oh, no! (laughing) You two got a meet-cute? Uh... well, Charlie pulled the fire alarm while I was trying to take my driving test. I had to get his attention somehow, you know? How long you been married? Six months. Two years. You two aren't really married, are you? No, we... we met three days ago. Three days. Wow. You two must not be able to keep your hands off each other, eh? Oh, no, Holden's been nothing but a perfect gentleman, but, you know, sometimes a girl just wants to be ravaged, you know... Hear, hear. Okay. (laughs) So the two of you came all the way out to the boonies to stargaze and not have s*x? Helen : Phil. Phil : What? Oh. Sorry. (indistinct chatter, laughter) (lamp falling on floor) No, no, no, no! What? Wait. ♪ I love you ♪ What's it gonna be? The red pill or the blue pill? Blue pill. ♪ I need you ♪ Charlie : Oh, my God! (Holden laughing) (Charlie grumbling) Um, maybe I shouldn't ask you this, and maybe I should, but if... if you haven't done this before, it doesn't matter. No, no, I'm so sorry. No, it's okay, I just... ♪ Hey girl ♪ (indistinct singing) ♪ I want you ♪ Okay. ♪ Hey girl ♪ (laughing) You good there? (laughing) Smooth, right? Yeah. Wow. (indistinct singing) ♪ I kiss you ♪ (singing in French) (static and sound from TV) ♪ Do you love me? ♪ 
♪ Do you love me? ♪ (exploding) (Charlie laughs) Did I just...? Oh, yeah, yep. I think you did. (laughs) Hey. Hi. You look terrible. Uh, gee, thanks. (Diane laughs) Hey... talk? Um... I was drivin' home from work today, and I got to thinkin' about Holden. He called. He's havin' fun. No, no, no, not about the road trip, it... You know, it must seem to him like life is rushing at him like, like a speeding train. Tom. Growing pains are normal. Yeah. I know. Uh... there's just some things that don't square with me. I want you to hear me out, okay? There's a cult called Hollow Sky, and Jeff seems to think... Jeff? You're talking to Jeff McArdle? You're not getting roped into one of his conspiracy theories... Listen, I'm... I'm not saying I believe all of it... what if he's just a little bit right? Listen to me. Diane, listen to me. Hollow Sky preys on war vets, grieving families, they got their fingers in all sorts of pies. Charities... including "Helping Hands." Don't. You've had an ax to grind with Ian since Day One. How much did you really know about Pastor Ian? Stop this, please! You're going down another rabbit hole. No, this is different! No, it's not! Tom, we lost you. I don't even know what we lost you to. I know, all right? I wasn't there for you and Luke. And I'm sorry for that. Very sorry. I'm sorry. Holden waking up is a second chance. For all of us. I know. You know what? I'm gonna make some coffee and... just... stay, and... No, I'm okay, I'm all right, I'm good. Are you sure? Yeah. I gotta go. Hey... forget about what I just said, okay? Just forget about it. Good night. Good night. (phone trilling) Hey, Jeff. I, uh... I need a favor. I wanna thank you all for traveling on such short notice. And for your continued service to Hollow Sky. You've proven that you're willing to do what needs to be done, no questions asked. What you witness tomorrow may beg questions... questions that I'm not authorized to answer. But believe me when I say our defining moment is near. This job is not your garden variety snatch and grab. Our target is a young man named Holden Matthews. A Google search will tell you he was in a 12-year coma. It will not tell you how dangerous he is. Failing to bring him in puts our entire cause at risk. We hit the cabins at daybreak. Surprise is our only advantage. With luck, we'll storm the cabins, shoot Holden pull of tranqs, and have him in a van before anybody's awake. Now there is an X factor. There's a girl with Mr. Matthews. If you find... Holden Matthews is the target. The girl is expendable. (breathing heavily) Charlie? Hey. What's going on? I was thinking... there must be a lot of places you wanna see. What if we didn't go back to Fort Reed? I'm... I'm having an amazing... time with you, Charlie. Fort Reed is my home. Smalltown, U. S. A., a guy with super powers is gonna stick out, but, in some big city on the other side of the world, maybe not so much. If what I am puts my family in danger, then... you know, it's my responsibility to keep them safe. I just... need to be prepared for whatever is coming my way. Sorry, it's so late. Meeting ran long as usual. Clint Drew's congregation is in all kinds of disarray, or so he says. (laughs) You okay? Yeah, yeah. I... I'm just tired. My brain is fried from work. Mm. Were you going to invite me in, or, uh... are you hiding somebody in there? (laughs) All right. We're all set up. The hour of the wolf. The hour of the what? The hour before dawn, hour of the wolf it's called. More babies are born, more people die. Yellow Jacket :  When you dream and when your nightmares are at their strongest. My grandpa told me about it when I was a boy. He was from the old country. Brought some of those old ideas with him. Back then they didn't fear the unknown. They stared into it. So this kid... he's the wolf. No, no, no, Holden's not the wolf. Oh. You're the wolf. Nobody is the... the... The wolf is the wolf. The... the... the wolf is you. It represents your worst fears. It comes knockin' on your door, and it's like a... it's like a reckoning, Ramon. Hm. Oh! (phone chimes) _ (breathing) (birds singing) (gunshot) (gunshots) (shouting) Aah!
