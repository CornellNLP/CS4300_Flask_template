 Have you had any thoughts about what you'd like to do? 
 For our 20th? 
 Whatever you want is fine by me. 
 Oh, Peter, you need to fix that tie. It's supposed to hide the top button. 
 The press will be there, remember. And I expect there'll be quite a crowd. 
 You love that, don't you? 
 There you are. Much better. 
 Can we get a move on, please? 
 Oh, I don't know what all the fuss is about. 
 Not like you haven't seen the guy before. 
 Yeah, come on. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 Leave it. Come on, I'll buy you another one. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Come on. 
 I think we should have a small party at the house on our actual anniversary with just a few friends... but we also need something much more high profile. 
 So I'm thinking, maybe a gala dinner? 
 Invite businesspeople, see if we can't get a couple of celebrities and we'll send out a press statement, I bet they'll be all over it. 
 (JOVIAL FOLK MUSIC) 
 Good turnout, eh? 
 Yeah. 
 I was really ready for that ice cream. Only got one lick. 
 Look, here he comes! 
 Oi-oi! 
 (CHEERING) 
 I told you there'd be a good crowd. 
 You must be pleased. 
 It's you they're here for. 
 (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) 
 Hello! 
 Oh, no. 
 He's got Cruella de Vil with him. 
 I like her dress. 
 Hey, PB. 
 Hey, Mick. How you doing? Good to see you. 
 Well, hello, hello, thank you. 
 This is a big day for us. 
 PB's - that's me up there, by the way - has launched restaurants, well, all over the west coast but this one, here... 
 Well, it's very special to us because it was our first. 
 Re-launching a restaurant is... 
 Well, it's like coming home. 
 My dad was a trawlerman and he used to say, "Son..." 
 He never could remember my name. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 He'd say, "Fishermen are a family. We need each other. Look out for each other." 
 And that's what PB's is all about. 
 We're a family. 
 I would now like to hand over to my lovely first wife, I call her that to keep her on her toes, to cut the ribbon and declare this restaurant open. 
 GUNSHOT PB! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Come here. 
 Help! 
 One minute, he was laughing and joking - the next, it was terrible. 
 It was terrible. 
 Mum, drink this. 
 His poor wife. 
 She's not the one with a bullet in her head, is she? 
 Mick! What? My mum's upset. 
 She's upset? He was MY mate. 
 You hardly knew him. 
 We went to the same school together. 
 Yeah, he married money but he never forgot his roots. 
 Used to pop in here and play pool. 
 Once in a blue moon. 
 Will you two stop niggling? Look, you've both had a shock. 
 Shh, turn it up. 
 A long-range shot. 
 Now, obviously, we're pursuing a number of lines of inquiry but, from the evidence so far, we believe Peter Bradshaw was targeted by a highly trained professional. 
 Thank you. 
 Morning. 
 Hiya. 
 Just like Jackie Kennedy. 
 Who's Jackie Kennedy? Is she a relative? 
 You frighten me sometimes. 
 GP notes. 
 He was diagnosed with depression and was on a prescription - Mirtazapine and Amitriptyline. 
 Poor man. He was obviously very unhappy. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Come in. 
 Mick, can I help you? 
 You got a minute? 
 Actually, I'm rather busy. 
 Look, you and me, I know there's no love lost. 
 You've got that right. 
 I'm here about PB. 
 Ah! Here was me thinking you were here about my mum. 
 Your mum? Yeah, she's fine, by the way. Thanks for asking. 
 She's a tough old bird. 
 How well did you know him? 
 I know he wasn't happy. 
 When did you last see him? 
 A couple of weeks ago. 
 He was in the pub with some bloke. Who? 
 No idea. But something wasn't right. 
 Any idea what? 
 If you ask me, that wife of his kept him on a short leash. 
 You think every married man is on a short leash. 
 That marriage was well dodgy. 
 You want my advice, start looking there. 
 I know how to do my job, Mick. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Excuse me. 
 Jane Kennedy. 
 Yes, I did get the report.  Thank you. 
 Hold on one second. 
 Ma'am. 
 Mrs Bradshaw, I'm Jane Kennedy, the coroner. 
 I'm so sorry for your loss. 
 I've already been over everything with the police. 
 I'm not the police. 
 I just want to get the truth, for your husband's sake. 
 It won't bring him back, will it? 
 It's natural to feel angry. 
 How do you expect me to feel? 
 We were happily married for 20 years. 
 According to his GP, he was on antidepressants. 
 Did you know? 
 Of course I knew. We had no secrets. 
 He suffered from depression, so what? 
 The impression I have is, Peter was very well liked but... do you know if he had any enemies? 
 Where shall I start? 
 The green-eyed monsters? 
 The business rivals? 
 Or the lunatics that were making death threats? 
 He'd had death threats? 
 Sorry to disturb you again, Mrs Bradshaw. 
 I just wondered... 
 Oh, hello. 
 I wondered if you could clear something up. What? 
 Found this in your husband's papers. It's a payment, for a rather large amount, to a Jason Alexander. 
 Diamonds. 
 Sorry? 
 Pink diamonds. 
 For me. 
 For our wedding anniversary. 
 Next month. 
 I think she's holding something back. 
 She's not the only one. 
 Found Peter Bradshaw's mobile phone hidden in his desk. 
 Pay-as-you-go. The call history's been wiped. 
 She said they had no secrets. 
 Yeah, right. 
 She tell you anything else? 
 She said he'd had death threats. 
 Yeah. Anonymous phone calls, people saying he didn't deserve to live. 
 There's nothing concrete though. No demands. 
 They just upped their security and carried on. 
 Listen, do you think you can get anything else out of her? 
 What? More than you, you mean? 
 Oh, come on. 
 Help me out here, Calamity, please. 
 So, why would Peter Bradshaw be targeted? 
 So, you saw me on the TV last night? 
 Yes. 
 You scrub up well. 
 Well, like I said, on the television, whoever he is, he's a real pro. 
 Ballistics traced the shot to a church tower across the water but there's no evidence there, though. 
 Apart from a trace of ice cream, where he must've stood. 
 Mick said something about him marrying money. 
 Yeah, it was her business. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 He was bankrupt so he was disqualified from being a director. 
 Hello? 
 Hello, Sylvie, love. 
 No, that's all right, go on. 
 Oh, right. OK. I'm on my way. 
 Listen, something's come up, I've got to go. 
 Swing by the station later, all right? I'll fill you in. 
 Oh! Will you look where you're going? 
 I'm so sorry. Oh, gosh. 
 It's all right. 
 Can I buy you another one? 
 I don't think so. 
 This is a very expensive suit. 
 No, I meant another coffee. 
 No time. I better go and clean up. 
 Sorry. Cheers. 
 Am I in the right station? Right, walk with me. 
 Love the suit. Can't even smell the mothballs. 
 You must be getting a cold. 
 I'm fronting a press conference. Oh? 
 PB's is a huge business but they're seriously overfishing. 
 So, they export everything to Thailand where it's processed and frozen by very cheap, some would say child labour. 
 It's really dodgy stuff. 
 But so are a lot of big companies, so why would he be targeted? 
 Well, we don't know. 
 Could be that he's just first on the list. 
 International activist group, eco-warriors, Thai business rivals, take your pick. I'm working with Scotland Yard on this one so you'll have to take a back-seat - but feel free to come and watch. 
 Wait a minute. 
 OK. 
 Quiet now, please, everyone. 
 Take your seats. 
 Take a seat. 
 Hello, everyone. 
 I'm Detective Inspector Ben Marshall from Scotland Yard. 
 I'm going to be working closely with South Dart Police on this case. 
 I ask you to please understand this is a high security investigation and I won't be answering any specific questions. 
 We believe that Peter Bradshaw was targeted by an organised group and the public, at large, is not at risk. 
 Excuse me. Sorry, I said no questions. 
 As yet, no group has claimed responsibility. 
 They might go straight to you guys. 
 In which case, you ask for a password and you contact me immediately. Everyone got that? 
 Great. OK, folks. Well, thanks very much. 
 I believe there are some refreshments in the next room so, please help yourselves. 
 Sorry, this is my investigation, my press conference. 
 Sergeant Higgins? That's right. 
 I respect this is your gig but, when it comes to international police work, best to leave it to the experts, OK? 
 I'm bringing in a media officer. 
 A Holmes team and an Interpol liaison officer. 
 Now, aren't you going to introduce us? 
 Oh, Jane Kennedy, coroner. 
 Well, Jane Kennedy, coroner, you can buy me that cappuccino now. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 DI Marshall. 
 OK, tell them I'll be right there. 
 Ballistics expert's just arrived. 
 I'll take a raincheck on that coffee. 
 Davey's got Scotland Yard and Interpol involved. 
 He thinks it's to do with his business methods abroad. 
 Well, he's wrong. 
 It's his personal life - but if Davey boy's getting his rocks off hanging out with Interpol... 
 Well, I guess that just leaves you. 
 All right, Mick? 
 You said something about his wife keeping him on a short leash. 
 What did you mean? 
 Well, that business came from her family. 
 She controlled the money, and him. 
 PB told you this? 
 He didn't have to. 
 One time, he bailed me out. 
 Ten grand, he lent me. 
 Peanuts to the likes of them but she came down and told me not to ask PB for help any more. 
 Reckoned that he was a bit of a soft touch and I was a flyboy. 
 Yeah, OK, I done a bit of ducking and diving in my time but that cow... OK, point taken. 
 Do you think he was faithful to her? 
 How would I know? 
 I'm just asking. 
 Why? You think I set him up with some girls? 
 Is what you're getting at? 
 I'm trying to help. 
 By raking up dirt? 
 You're unbelievable. 
 Why do you put up with that oaf? 
 Mostly for the s*x. 
 Oh, Mum. 
 What did you make of PB? 
 I never said more than two words to him. 
 I'm sorry, love, I wish I could remember something useful for you, but I can't. 
 Oh! Mmm. 
 I just love this stuff. 
 On the way to PB's, I had a lovely big cone. 
 Mick was in such a hurry to get there, he made me drop it on some poor guy's shoe and I felt really... Ow! 
 Sorry. 
 Try and remember, Judith, love, please. 
 He'd on a black T-shirt, I think. 
 And sunglasses, didn't he, Mick? 
 I don't know. I never really looked at the guy. 
 You saying that was him? 
 Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, yeah. 
 How tall was he? My height? Mick's height? 
 Average, I think. 
 And he had a hat - a baseball cap. 
 Maybe. 
 I never really looked at him, I was too busy looking at his shoe. 
 It was black. 
 I saw him and I did nothing. 
 I think I'm going to be sick. 
 Oh, Mick, don't. Judith! 
 Judith! Judith! 
 Briefing room. Ten minutes. 
 Count me out. 
 I've got a Skype call with the Garda Siochana. 
 That's the Irish national crime agency... 
 Yeah, I know who they are. 
 What is their connection to the case? 
 Quite possibly none. 
 I'm speaking to national crime agencies all over the world. 
 Hi, Annette. 
 It's going to be another late one, I'm afraid, love. 
 No, I don't know when. 
 No, no, no, I'll get something from the canteen. 
 No, don't wait up. 
 All right, night then. 
 SCREAMING So, fishing's in your blood? 
 That's right. My father was a trawlerman and his father before him. 
 But you joined the Army? 
 I had three great years. 
 I made some good mates. 
 In fact, I think there's a reunion in a couple of months. 
 Why did you leave? 
 I met my wife while I was home on leave. 
 I think it was the uniform that did it. 
 You still got it? 
 I... 
 Sorry, what was the question again? 
 Let's move on. 
 From humble origins, you now have a successful fishing company and a chain of restaurants all over the Devon coastline. 
 We do indeed. 
 You're quoted as saying, "We support local industry and have brought hundreds of jobs to the community." 
 That's correct. Then why do you ship your fish to Thailand to be gutted and frozen? 
 Well, I mean, in these modern times, you have to think globally as well as locally. 
 So, are you thinking globally or locally when you deplete the sea of its natural resources... 
 We're struggling to meet the demands...  
 .. and pollute the oceans? 
 ..and keep prices down. 
 So, you employ cheap labour? 
 As I said... Slave labour? 
 No. 
 Child labour? 
 What? No. 
 No, absolutely not. 
 I strongly deny that. 
 Yes, we have factories in Thailand, but I'm not involved in the day-to-day running of... 
 But I will look into it. 
 I will. I will certainly do that. 
 So, what do you think? 
 Doesn't tell us anything we don't already know, does it? 
 I know that. Still, it's better than the old bird with an ice cream cone. 
 The chances are that "old bird with the ice cream cone" may have seen the killer that day. 
 So what? 
 He'd have been on a plane within a couple of hours of the shooting. 
 You can't say that. For all we know, he could still be here. 
 Listen, Dave. 
 There are two kinds of hit men. 
 The local thug, who'll knock somebody off for 100 quid, and the real pro, who can name his price and works all over the world - like our guy. 
 We're working at an international level, looking for patterns, connections, MOs of known assassins. 
 Not the kind of door-to-door, good cop/bad cop scene you're used to. 
 No-one's claimed responsibility yet though, have they? 
 No. 
 And have you managed to establish any "patterns" that would suggest a known assassin? 
 Not yet, no. No. 
 No leads from the Garda Siochana? 
 Or any of the other international crime agencies? 
 Not yet. 
 No. Well, let me know when you do. 
 And let me remind you that it is the local police that are in charge of this investigation. 
 Dave, actually, there is one bit of local knowledge that would be really helpful. 
 Yeah. What's that? That hot coroner. Is she available? 
 I will look into it. 
 I will. I certainly will do that. 
 And Ben Marshall dismissed this? 
 Yeah. Mr Big Shot from the Met. 
 This is huge. You think so? 
 These guys are flirting. 
 Oh, come on. You got my hopes up for a minute. 
 No, seriously, look, I'll show you. 
 Have you still got it? 
 I... 
 Sorry, what was the question again? 
 Mick, is this the guy you saw with PB? 
 Nope. 
 But you knew he was gay? 
 Mick, you're not helping by holding things back. 
 What difference does it make? 
 Well, I think it would make a difference to his wife. 
 Is this a bad time? 
 I was just...sorting through my husband's things to send to charity. 
 How dare this young man harass my husband like this? 
 Do you know him? No, I do not. 
 So, you've never seen him before? No. 
 Why did you show me this? 
 I'm sorry if it upset you but your husband rarely gave interviews. 
 Why do you think he agreed to this one? 
 You'd have to ask him that. 
 Oh, but you can't, can you? 
 On account of him being dead. 
 Your husband said something about an Army reunion. 
 What? 
 In the interview. Do you know if he went? 
 Why would he? He was in the Army for five minutes. He has nothing in common with these people. Nothing. 
 You've got a visitor. 
 So, this is where you hang out? 
 I see you got the stain out. 
 Thought you'd be pleased. 
 Will you let me pay for the dry cleaning? 
 Only if you let me take you out for dinner. 
 Well, I... Give me your phone. 
 What for? Just give me your phone. 
 Let's do it tonight, OK? 
 PHONE BEEPS Now I've got your number. 
 I'll make a reservation and get back to you. 
 See you later. 
 Plonker. 
 You're not really going to go out with him, are you? 
 Clint! What? 
 See what you can find out about a recent reunion for PB's old regiment. 
 OK, but do you still want this? 
 Want what? This. 
 The interview guy. 
 Yes. 
 It should never have been online. 
 It was the camera guy. 
 I'm furious about it. 
 I promised Peter it was for academic purposes only. 
 It was part of my PhD research. 
 And now, this. 
 Sorry, I still can't take in what's happened. 
 You and Peter were close? 
 They're saying it was some kind of activist group or something? 
 That's one line of inquiry. 
 The police were asking me if I was involved with any radical political organisations. 
 I'm not the police, Michael. I won't ask you that. 
 Like I would set Peter up. 
 I never showed that interview to anyone apart from my supervisor. 
 
 
 
 Oh, wow! 
 Vinyl. 
 Cool. Do you mind if I...? Yeah. 
 Oh, mate. 
 Oh, Miles Davis. 
 You like Miles Davis? 
 The guy who invented cool? 
 Don't you think he sounds better on vinyl? 
 Don't you think everything sounds better on vinyl? 
 JANE CLEARS THROAT Sorry. Where were we? 
 Were you and Peter close? 
 We were, actually. 
 We became friends. 
 Watching you together, I thought, perhaps, you were more than friends. 
 Maybe, but... 
 I never set out to come between him and his wife. 
 Did you know her? 
 I met her once. I came by the office and she was there. 
 She asked Peter to introduce us. 
 She seemed a perfectly nice woman. Why? 
 I think there's more you're not telling me. 
 If there is, I can't see how it could help Peter. 
 It might help you...to tell someone. 
 This must be a very hard time for you right now. 
 I loved Peter, I really did, but I wasn't in love with him. 
 I wish I could've been, but I just wasn't. 
 But he was in love with you? 
 I didn't mean for it to happen but, yeah, he left his wife. 
 He wanted us to live together - to be together but... 
 But I never meant things to go that far, so I ended it. 
 And he went back to his wife? 
 I think it was the best thing for both of them. 
 Look, there's no reason for anyone to know this, is there? 
 I mean, like, that woman's lost her husband. 
 At least let her keep her pride. 
 So there's the guy with a knife in his chest, yeah? 
 Blood everywhere, and this singing, so we follow it and there's another guy, on a bed, blind drunk, completely covered in blood and guess what he was singing? 
 No idea. 
 ♪ I did it my way. ♪ 
 HE LAUGHS So, what kind of person becomes a sniper? 
 You mean outside the forces? 
 I mean, that could kill a total stranger in cold blood. 
 It's a job. 
 He's not thinking about the person, he's thinking about wind speed, movement of target, means of escape. 
 And we can tell - from things like where the shot was fired, distance, accuracy, bullet fall - how well trained the sniper is and maybe even who. 
 In this case? 
 No idea. Brick wall, I'm afraid. 
 So, Jane Kennedy, I hear you've just moved back to the area. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 I'm living with my mum. 
 Oh, must be a bit awkward for the love life. 
 Well, not really, I'm not actually... 
 Well, as luck would have it, my hotel is very close and I have a rather nice room. 
 So how about we finish... 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Sorry. 
 Hi, Mum, is everything all right? 
 It's me. 
 Are you OK? 
 Listen, I got the info on that Army reunion... and some pictures. 
 No, it's all right. Try not to worry, I'm on my way home. 
 Hello? 
 My mum's had a fall. I've got to go. I'm sorry. 
 I'll drive you. 
 No, no. I have the car. 
 Finish your dinner. 
 Sorry. 
 (LOUD MOANING FROM UPSTAIRS) 
 Jane, is that you? 
 Jane? 
 I wasn't expecting you till later. 
 I don't believe this. What if Beth had walked in? 
 She's at a sleepover, remember? 
 Oh, yeah. I forgot. 
 What happened to your date? 
 It wasn't a date. 
 It was just, you know... 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Oh, don't say he followed me. 
 Mum, just go back in the room and stay there. 
 All right, with pleasure. 
 What are you doing here? You OK? 
 You were weird on the phone. 
 Oh, yeah, sorry about that. Come in. 
 It was just a... 
 Escape call? 
 Yeah. Good timing. Thanks, Clint. 
 That bad, was it? 
 Are those the photos? 
 Yeah, here they are. 
 Mick, can you just come down here a minute, please? 
 Come in. 
 Can you look at these and tell me if you recognise any of them? 
 PB... 
 Him. 
 That's the guy I saw him with. 
 Are you sure? 
 Dead sure. Great. 
 Clint, see what you can find out about him. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm on it. Thanks. 
 Sorry, mate. Cheers. 
 All right. 
 Morning. 
 Hey. Take a look at this. 
 Brian Digsby, AKA Digger. 
 He's got a boat repair shop over in Lansdowne Bay. 
 Mick said he saw PB talking to him in the Black Dog a few weeks ago, said it looked pretty serious. 
 I thought I saw you come in. 
 Hello. 
 Shame dinner was cut short last night. I know. I'm sorry. 
 We'll have to fix up a re-match. 
 Can we talk about this later? 
 Certainly can. 
 Can't believe you went out with that pillock. 
 Will you stop going on about it? 
 What did you see in him? His charm? His personality? His good looks? 
 I wouldn't say he's good looking. 
 Oh, he is. You ask him. 
 (SAW WHIRS) 
 Brian Digsby? 
 Brian? 
 What? Brian Digsby? 
 Digger. Yes? 
 I'm Jane Kennedy. 
 I'm the coroner for Peter Bradshaw. This is Detective Sergeant Higgins. 
 Sorry. I just need to finish this. 
 We understand you were a friend of Peter Bradshaw's. 
 Not really. 
 We were in the Army together, way back. 
 But you saw him recently? 
 That's right. 
 Can you tell us anything about him? 
 Like what? 
 How did he seem to you? 
 Rich. 
 I meant his state of mind. 
 Last time you saw him, did he confide anything in you? 
 Like what? This is a murder inquiry, my friend. 
 At least have the decency to come down here and speak to us, please. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, you were seen together in the Black Dog, having a serious discussion. About what? 
 My wife died last year. 
 We were talking about that. 
 I'm sorry. 
 How long were you in the Army? 
 15 years. 
 And then? 
 Lived abroad. 
 Had a boatyard in Angola. 
 I came back here when my wife died. 
 Why? Where were you on the 14th, between 10 and 12? 
 The 14th? 
 Yeah. 
 It was the day PB was shot. 
 In hospital. 
 Acute coronary syndrome. 
 I saw it on the news, in the ward. 
 It's a terrible business. 
 Well, that was a waste of time, wasn't it? 
 Like you'd go for a drink with someone you're about to bump off. 
 You might do, cos you'd have to get to know him, his routines. 
 OK, so you're an expert on snipers now, since you been hanging out with Ben Marshall? 
 I think Brian Digsby's holding something back. 
 (HE SCOFFS) What? You always say that. 
 And I have to tell you, it's not helpful. Oh, excuse me. 
 Maybe if you'd some idea about what's being held back... (PHONE RINGS) ..that would be worth saying. 
 Hello? Yeah. 
 How much? 
 Yeah, all right, OK. 
 When was this? 
 All right, I'm on my way. 
 I've had someone look into Joy Bradshaw's finances. 
 Is that legal? 
 I call it the Ways and Means Act. 
 Four weeks before her husband was killed, she withdrew ã100,000 in cash. 
 Hold on. Don't start jumping to conclusions. 
 I won't. Just because you're desperate to get... Get what? 
 Get a break in this case. 
 Please don't overreact. 
 I won't. 
 Promise me. 
 I won't. 
 I'll ask you again, what was the money for? 
 I refuse to answer that. 
 Quite convenient for you, wasn't it, Mrs Bradshaw, your husband's death? 
 Your marriage is a sham. He's gay. 
 He's having an affair. 
 You're this high up in dodgy business practices - but, with him out of the way, all your problems are solved. 
 This is outrageous. 
 Really, you think so? 
 A woman in your position? 
 Money, connections. 
 I'd have thought paying someone to do your dirty work is just par for the course. 
 Mrs Bradshaw, I'm so sorry. 
 Imogen? What took you so long? 
 This is Imogen Beaton, Mrs Bradshaw's solicitor. 
 If you'd like to wait in my office, I'll be with you shortly. 
 Could you organise some coffee, constable? 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Don't thank me. 
 What for? 
 Stopping this fiasco while you've still got a job. 
 Now, you listen to me, Marshall. 
 INSPECTOR Marshall. 
 And you listen to me, that woman is so well connected, she could end your career like that. 
 Or what's left of it, Sergeant. 
 Mrs Bradshaw. What are you doing here? 
 If you must know, I've been hauled into this station like a common criminal. 
 That must have been difficult for you. 
 Can you tell me when this will be over... so I can bury my husband with some dignity? 
 I don't know. We're all very keen to resolve it. 
 Oh, please. 
 You're all loving it. 
 Getting to see how the other half live. 
 Why did you lie to me about knowing Michael Larkin? 
 Why do you think? 
 To protect my husband's memory. 
 So, he made a mistake, but we were back together, stronger than ever. 
 The money you withdrew before he was killed? ã100,000. 
 What was it for? I don't have to explain myself. 
 Under the circumstances, I'm afraid you do. 
 It's a very large sum of money. 
 To you, maybe. 
 To me, it's a day's shopping in Paris. 
 A day's shopping in Paris? 
 Nice. If that rich bitch thinks... 
 You promised you wouldn't overreact. 
 ..her money can protect her. 
 Bringing a suspect in for questioning is not overreacting. 
 For all the good it's done you. 
 Joy Bradshaw has clammed up and you're no further forward in the case. Well, neither's Ben Marshall. 
 And you're pleased about that? 
 This is my investigation. 
 He's been undermining me every chance he can get. 
 It's not fair. How old are you, 12? 
 You didn't hear the way he spoke to me. Get over it. 
 Oh, right, I should've known you'd take his side. It's not about sides. 
 I've got a job to do. 
 A deeply unhappy man has been killed and I want to know why. 
 And I don't? I didn't say that. 
 No, there's a lot you don't say. 
 Not interrupting anything, am I? 
 No, we're done here. 
 Maybe you should stay here and I storm out. 
 Am I missing something? 
 No. 
 How's your mum? Fine, why? 
 So she wasn't badly hurt? 
 What? 
 When she fell? 
 Yes. No, she wasn't. 
 I mean, hurt. She wasn't badly hurt. 
 Bit of advice. 
 It's a good idea to keep track of the lies you tell. 
 I'm sorry, Ben. 
 Thing is, I'm just out of a relationship and I'm nowhere near ready to get involved with anyone. 
 Involved? 
 I was only after a bit of fun. 
 Your loss. 
 JANE: People are getting at each other's throats. 
 Nobody's getting anywhere and I don't know what my next move is. 
 You know, my dad was a trawlerman. 
 He was a rotten husband, a rotten dad, but he loved his fellow fishermen. 
 What happened to you, Peter? 
 You ended up with a huge company you had no control over. 
 Someone wanted you dead. 
 I don't know who, I don't know why. 
 I'm sorry I can't help you. 
 Hello, this is DS Higgins from South Dart Constabulary. 
 I was just wondering if you could have someone call me back through the switchboard please, if that's possible? 
 Yeah. It doesn't matter how late, it's very important. 
 All right, much obliged. 
 MUSIC: Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd 
 ♪ Now there's a look in your eye ♪ 
 ♪ Like black holes in the sky ♪ 
 ♪ Shine on, you crazy diamond ♪ 
 ♪ You were caught... ♪ 
 If you could send me a secure link, that would be very helpful. 
 Great, lovely. Thank you, and thanks for getting back. 
 All right, goodnight. 
 (E-MAIL BEEPS) 
 Nice one. 
 You come to apologise? 
 You first. 
 Listen, you'll never guess... 
 Did we ever find those diamonds? Eh? 
 The ones PB bought before he was killed. 
 Joy was searching for... 
 It's not important. Look at this. 
 You know you said Digger was holding something back? 
 So you do listen to me then? 
 Come and have a look at this. 
 I've checked his Army records. 
 He's had specialist training. 
 Sniper. 
 Experienced in the field. 
 The only thing is, his alibi checks out. 
 Hold on, let's think about this. 
 Hello. Can you put me through to the coronary care unit, please? 
 I've told you everything. 
 No, not quite. 
 You see, that discussion you had with Peter Bradshaw in the Black Dog, a witness has come forward. 
 You were overheard. 
 It's just talk. 
 I checked your Army records. 
 So? You were a highly trained soldier. 
 I was, in my time. 
 How's your heart? 
 Fine, thank you. 
 Got a check-up in three months. 
 You want to see the card? 
 Can't be too careful with hearts. 
 Just mention chest pains and they'll admit you for tests. 
 Thing is, once you get there, they dump you in a ward and you can hang around for the rest of the day. 
 No-one would know if you slipped out for an hour. 
 In fact, we checked. You could've. 
 The shooting, itself, would only take a few seconds... 
 ..for an experienced sniper. 
 Ex-soldier turned rogue. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Well, that's a nice little story you've got there. 
 Shame you don't have a scrap of evidence. 
 OK. Come on, let's go. 
 Nice talking to you. 
 Davey! 
 So he's lying there, covered in blood, blind drunk. 
 You'll never guess what he was singing. 
 ♪ I did it my way. ♪ 
 Remember that "old bird with the ice cream cone"? 
 Is that the best you can do? 
 No. He is. 
 I'll ask you again. 
 Who ordered the hit on Peter Bradshaw? 
 We can place you at the exact spot the shot was fired from. 
 You have the expertise and your alibi's fallen through. 
 You're going away for a long time, mate. 
 Now, you could make it shorter if you tell us who paid you. 
 Davey, we're just here to give her the information. 
 Not accuse her. I won't accuse her of anything. 
 The Ways and Means Act, remember? 
 I'll tell her Digger talked, see what she's got to say about that. 
 You've got some nerve coming here! 
 I have nothing to say to you. Nothing. 
 Oh, you might want to think about that. 
 Leave me alone. Go on, get out. 
 I said, go. Now! 
 You got a hearing problem? 
 I would go but I can't leave things like this. 
 It was a mistake coming here. 
 I just wanted to pay my respects. 
 I'm the last person you want to see right now. 
 I should've realised. 
 I'm so sorry. I'll go. 
 Stay where you are. 
 Arrest him. For what? 
 Poor thing, she's all mixed up. 
 Oh, shut up. Just shut up. 
 It's over, all right? 
 You want the truth, I'll give you the truth. 
 She's all mixed up. This is too much stress. 
 He's come here threatening me. 
 He says he'll do a kiss and tell about himself and Peter. 
 That's not what I said at all. 
 She's upset. She's looking for someone to blame. 
 You're not getting another penny out of me. 
 "Another" penny? 
 It's not important. 
 We'll be the judge of that. 
 Look, she approached me. It was her idea. 
 To do what? 
 Come on, we can do this here or down the station. 
 She paid me, all right? 
 To do what? 
 To leave Peter. 
 Oh, come on, that's pathetic. 
 Is this true? 
 I did it for my husband. 
 To get him out of his clutches. 
 So you could get your claws back in, you mean. 
 You were only ever interested in his money. Your money, you mean? 
 That's how she controlled him. 
 Said she'd leave him without a penny if they split up and he still chose me. He loved me. 
 What would you know about love? 
 You cheap little rent boy! 
 If I am, Peter couldn't get enough of me. 
 He wept when he knew I was leaving. 
 You should've heard him beg. 
 Liar! 
 You're a dried up old hag. 
 You made his skin crawl. 
 He's better off dead than stuck with you for the rest of his life. 
 Enough! 
 That's it. That's... 
 It was you. 
 You two... You drove him to it. 
 You broke his heart and you sucked the life out of him. 
 Peter Bradshaw ordered the murder on himself. 
 That's ridiculous. 
 Well, we'll know soon enough. 
 We have the gunman down the station, which is where we're going now. 
 I'm arresting you for suspicion of blackmail. 
 You don't have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court. 
 Those pink diamonds you were looking for, I think we'll find your husband used them to pay his killer. 
 You've had a shock. 
 I'll get the maid to make you some tea. 
 So, he took a contract out on himself? 
 I know it's surprising. 
 Not really, when you think about it. 
 Told you, didn't I? 
 Sorry? 
 That wife of his made his life a misery. 
 I pointed you in the right direction. 
 All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.
