 I think I might make a vegetable patch out there - if anything grows this close to the sea. 
 I shall have to ask Andrew, see what... 
 What would your wife say about you digging up the patio? 
 She won't mind. Not been together long. 
 Honeymoon period. 
 I need a hobby. 
 Well, your wife might suggest that's what SHE'S for. 
 But if it makes you happy, then dig up the whole thing. 
 I need to dress. I don't want to be late. 
 He'll be fine about it. 
 Drop dead! 
 Andrew! 
 Er, the freezer door in bay two keeps jamming. 
 Then deal with it! 
 It's a shock. 
 He'll understand. 
 Never shouted at me before. 
 Because you've never stood up to him before. 
 He needs his independence. 
 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. 
 You're going to let him walk all over you? 
 I need to put this right. He needs me. 
 He's using you. 
 Christine... Christine! 
 Morning, Dave. Morning, Pete. 
 The lock's broken on the inside. 
 One of our workers got trapped in it yesterday. 
 Ooh! Oh! 
 Go call an ambulance! 
 No. Where? 
 What did Cornish Pete say? 
 Gross! 
 That's confidential. Then don't leave it in the bathroom. 
 Well, I was working on it. 
 What? On the toilet? 
 Yeah, thanks. Hope your infection clears up. 
 Robert Talbot's dead. 
 Froze to death in his own ice cream factory. 
 Reckon it could be murder. 
 Who are you? The police? 
 I've picked up some things. 
 Do us all a favour, Mum. Stick to being a barmaid. 
 Who put this in here? 
 How would I know? I'm only a barmaid. 
 Morning. Morning. 
 Right, I'll introduce you. Wife, son. 
 And Rose Porter - she's the factory manager. 
 She found him. OK. Thanks. 
 Pistachio and mint choc chip. 
 What? 
 Fridays after school. Double scoop on the quay. 
 Start the weekend. Remember? 
 Jane Kennedy, Coroner. 
 My condolences, Mrs Talbot. 
 Er, Jane. This is Mrs Talbot. 
 Oh, right. Sorry. 
 My sincere condolences. 
 I was just trying to establish who saw Robert last. 
 It's my fault. 
 I left him here about 7.30 last night. 
 I should have stayed. 
 Don't beat yourself up, Ro. 
 Mrs Talbot? 
 Yesterday, around five. 
 I can't do this. 
 Right, OK. I think it's time to go and meet Robert. Yeah. 
 Could you get these people a cup of tea, please? 
 Thank you. 
 I've let the Health and Safety Executive know. 
 They're happy for me to lead. 
 Thanks. 
 He had his phone with him. 
 Yeah, there's no service here, though. I checked. 
 D'you tell Annette if you're working all night? 
 Course. She'd think I was down the pub otherwise. 
 Or out with my fancy woman. 
 Which I wouldn't be. Obviously. 
 Nothing to do with me. 
 This is no good, is it? 
 It's frozen solid. 
 CSI said there's no prints in here. 
 None? 
 No. Staff wear gloves. 
 Why didn't he try to get out? 
 Maybe he didn't want to. 
 I want a forensic PM and a tox report. Let's fast track it. 
 Thank you. 
 We went out for a meal. Left about 11.15. 
 You can't think we're involved? 
 Any particular reason why you met your dad yesterday? 
 He was... selling up. 
 Right. Perhaps we better interview you both separately. 
 Andrew, if you wouldn't mind. 
 It's an American firm - they're buying him out. 
 That must have been a bit of shock. 
 Talbot's has been here years, hasn't it? 
 83. Robert wanted to get the paperwork ready for the sale. 
 I offered to stay but he insisted I left him to it. 
 He felt guilty. Why? 
 They're buying the brand, not this place. 
 I was planning to retire anyway. 
 I've been here nearly 40 years. 
 Who knows about it? 
 Just me and Andrew. 
 I expect it's all going to be put on hold now that... 
 You said you left here at half seven? 
 Table was booked for quarter to eight. The Black Dog. 
 Bit of a dive, but Andrew likes it. 
 I just wanted to check that Andrew was OK. He's fine. 
 Business isn't his thing. 
 Do you think Robert could have killed himself? 
 Of course not. Why? 
 Just investigating every avenue. 
 Do you know anyone who might want to hurt him? 
 No, no. Everyone loved Robert. 
 Er, could I have any CCTV that you might have, please? 
 Oh, it doesn't cover much. 
 It's just the bit between the factory and the freezers. 
 OK, that will be fine, thank you. 
 Can't believe they're selling up, can you? 
 Part of our history, innit? 
 You know, everyone's history, obviously. 
 Not just yours and mine. 
 I know. I'll leave you to it. 
 19.28. 
 Rose leaves. 
 Goodnight, Rose. 
 20.56. 
 Christine arrives. 
 Hello! 
 21.19. Christine leaves again. 
 This is Robert Talbot's call log. 
 Oh, right. OK, thanks, Derek. 
 Last call, Christine Talbot, 20.15. 
 Christine. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow! 
 What a beautiful home. 
 Amazing view. 
 I was just going through Robert's contacts. 
 Everyone's devastated. 
 I can imagine. 
 Oh, um... 
 You dropped these. 
 Thank you. 
 I hadn't even noticed. 
 Can barely even think straight. 
 I was wondering, did you find it strange that Robert didn't come home last night? 
 I presumed he was working. 
 Mrs Talbot, as a coroner, you can bring things to my attention you wouldn't ordinarily to the police. 
 Is there anything? 
 Such as? 
 Something odd, might not seem important. 
 You don't think this was an accident? 
 Thanks very much. 
 Hello again. 
 I just wanted to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. 
 Yeah, course, go ahead. 
 I was talking to Mrs Talbot. 
 Oh. Right, sorry, yes. 
 How can I help, Detective Inspector? 
 Ah, Detective Sergeant. 
 Not for much longer, I'm sure. 
 Well, you know... 
 Er, I just wanted to check - you said you last saw Robert at five? Is that right? 
 Yes. 
 But I went to the factory at nine. 
 He wasn't there, I-I didn't see him. 
 He called. 
 Left a message. 
 Bit abrupt. We'd, um... had words. 
 I wanted him home. He wanted to work. 
 'Meet me at the factory at nine.' 
 I couldn't find him. His phone went to voicemail. 
 I thought he'd gone to get something to eat. 
 Got fed up waiting. 
 He must've been... 
 Why didn't you mention this earlier? 
 I was in shock. 
 Am I in trouble? 
 No. No. Not now you've told me, no. 
 Thank you. 
 Although technically, it is withholding. 
 I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... 
 Ms Kennedy, why don't you leave this to me? 
 Let me talk to Mrs Talbot. 
 Christine. Please. 
 I can handle it. I'm sure you've got other work to do. 
 Yeah. Let me know if I can be of any help. 
 That'll be Andrew Talbot. 
 Can you make a couple of teas before you go, please? 
 < Just through here. 
 Clint? 
 Er, have a seat. 
 Thanks. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yes. 
 The best way for an investigation to work is if everyone's honest. 
 Right, OK. 
 So I want you to be straight with me. 
 Why didn't you say you'd argued with your father about him stopping your allowance? 
 It's all we've done since he met Christine. 
 Argue. 
 I don't care about his money. I was angry with her. 
 Her claws were in so deep, I'm surprised he didn't bleed to death. 
 Were you angry he was selling Talbot's? 
 He wanted to retire. I didn't want to run it. 
 It's the family business. 
 I'm a vegan. I don't even eat ice cream. 
 All my dad did was work. Same as HIS dad. 
 And his dad before him. I don't want to do that. 
 Do you think it's possible your dad could have killed himself? 
 No. 
 Believe it or not, he was happy with Christine. 
 Why? 
 Just considering all options. 
 Thanks for coming in. Appreciate it. 
 Just... just make sure you consider Christine too. Yeah? 
 I don't care about money but she does. 
 Whatever I may have said to Dad before he... 
 I loved him. 
 Ow! 
 Morning. 
 I'm meeting Stace. 
 Don't forget we're going shopping. 
 You've cancelled five times already. 
 People dying. So inconsiderate... 
 OK, but there's a strict budget. 
 Where's your Gran? 
 Just called. She stayed at the Dog. 
 Mick wasn't feeling well. 
 What, a bug? 
 Scrumpy. Again? 
 Davey? 
 'You took your time. Just up?' 
 No. Been up for hours. 
 She said you offended her. 
 What? 
 Give me two seconds. 
 Beth, when did I offend her? Beth? When? 
 Hiya! Where you off to? 
 Shopping. 
 Oh. Want some money? 
 Nah, it's all right, thank you. 
 Go on. Put that in your pocket and don't tell your mum. Thank you. 
 Don't spend it all at once. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 You said give you two seconds. 
 Yeah. 
 Robert's PM. It's just in. Oh. 
 Hm. Time of death between eight and ten. 
 Yeah, call to Christine puts him still alive at 8.15. 
 He was drugged. Soprazine. It's a sedative. 
 Robert left everything to him and Christine. Split 50-50. 
 So he does have a motive. 
 So does Christine. 
 Anyway, I spoke to Andrew last night. 
 He said he wasn't bothered about the money. 
 Mick said Andrew was in the Black Dog all evening but I heard Mick was wasted. 
 So I just wanted to double-check with your mum. 
 She's not here. You can't ignore Christine as a suspect. 
 If she did it, she'd have an alibi, wouldn't she? 
 Not put herself on camera. Have you seen her nails? 
 Salon job. They're like Annette's. 
 Annette can't peel a spud without breaking a nail, so... 
 Christine couldn't have moved that body without breaking one. 
 That's the basis of your judgement? She didn't break a nail? 
 Well, works for me. Besides, if she was going to murder her husband, she'd wait til after the sale, wouldn't she? 
 She's too obvious. 
 And I like her. 
 She seemed very upset. 
 Not too upset to go through Robert's financial records. 
 How do YOU know? 
 Um, a folder fell off a table. 
 Fell or did you push it? 
 It fell! 
 You can't snoop through people's things. YOU can't rule her out. 
 I'm not ruling her out. 
 This is a murder enquiry, and I'm running it. 
 Good. I'm glad we got that straight. 
 Mm. 
 I'm going to check on Andrew's financial records. 
 Hey - nice knickers, by the way. 
 We've still got a business to run. 
 You'll be late with that order. Hurry up! 
 Hello, Rose. 
 We're all finding it tough. 
 Can't stop thinking about Robert. 
 It must have been awful for you, finding him. 
 I keep seeing his face. 
 Ah... sorry. 
 How can I help you? 
 Yesterday, when we asked you if anyone might want to hurt Robert, I just... 
 I felt you hesitated. 
 No. 
 No, it was nothing. 
 I'm not the police, Rose. 
 You can talk to me in confidence. 
 When Christine and Robert first got together... 
 ..he heard rumours. 
 Asked me to look into it. Discreetly. 
 What rumours? 
 They met at a widow and widower's dinner. 
 Her previous husbands had died and the first husband's daughter held a grudge, accused her of all sorts. 
 But there was nothing concrete. 
 Robert didn't believe her. 
 Did you? 
 Rose? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Know what this is? 
 Bindweed. A bloody nightmare. 
 Calystegia sepium. 
 When it flowers, it looks pretty enough but... it'll choke everything else to death. 
 Twists itself round all of them. 
 I call it Christine. 
 You're not a fan? 
 She said you told your dad to drop dead. 
 Bet she loved telling you that. 
 Why didn't you tell me you'd argued? 
 Because I know how it looks! 
 I didn't mean it. He wanted me to support myself. 
 Fine. I've got my gardening business. 
 Well, pays for the mortgage on this place. 
 But what about your debts? 
 All ã32,000 of them? 
 Still, your inheritance should cover that, shouldn't it? 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Mrs Talbot - um, Christine - wants an update. 
 Davey's not answering. OK. 
 Robert was drugged before he went into the freezer? 
 Sorry. It slipped out. 
 We don't know that for sure. 
 Talk to Andrew. 
 That hippy act's all a front. 
 His sandals alone cost ã300. 
 Handmade in Italy. 
 No doubt he'll accuse me. 
 Why would he do that? 
 To divert attention. I'm an easy target. 
 Because...? 
 I'm the wife. 
 Everyone always thinks it's the wife. 
 Sound like you've had experience of this before. 
 What? 
 Well, just that I heard you'd been married twice before. 
 There was nothing suspicious about either of my late husbands' deaths. 
 If you're insinuating... 
 No. I wasn't, honestly. 
 Then why bring it up? 
 I didn't think coroners listened to gossip. 
 I thought they were professionals. 
 Now, Mrs Talbot. I didn't... 
 Get the coroner's reports for her two previous husbands. 
 Track down the daughter of her first. Now. 
 I've made a list! 
 I told you - he was in here two nights ago with some woman. 
 You were lashed. 
 You could hardly see the barrel, let alone change it. 
 Rose Porter came in at 7.45, Andrew ten minutes after. 
 And he was here all night? 
 No. 
 Went out again ten minutes later. 
 Came back in...8.46. 
 That's very specific. 
 Us BARMAIDS notice these things. 
 He'd hardly been here when he left. 
 Rose looked so sad, sat on her own. 
 She'd ordered food. 
 Half a roast chicken and a nut roast. And the sides. 
 What were the sides? 
 It's not important. 
 Broccoli and mashed taters. 
 That was it. 
 I remember everything. 
 And what about Rose? 
 About 50. Dowdy. 
 Mutton dressed as mutton. 
 No, I meant, did she stay all night? 
 Oh, yeah, apart from a few trips to the toilets. 
 Right, thanks, Judith. 
 You're very thorough. 
 "Really thorough"! 
 Strange, innit? 
 Andrew doesn't care about money, but owes 30 grand of it. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 And there's a 41-minute gap in his alibi. 
 That's very tight. 
 So I reckon with the roadworks and the one-way, it'd take eight, maybe nine minutes by car. 
 Look, about Christine. 
 I went and saw Rose. She... 
 Excuse me. 
 
 
 
 He only went out for a few minutes. 
 41 minutes, Rose. 
 Took me seven minutes to run here from the Black Dog. 
 And he's younger. 
 Andrew'd never kill anyone! 
 He's a vegan. 
 So where did he go? 
 He went out for a cigarette and then bumped into a friend. Who? 
 He never said. 
 Why did you meet that night? 
 I told you. 
 It wasn't because Robert had stopped his allowance? 
 He was upset. Sad. Disappointed. 
 He'd never hurt anyone. 
 All right, you remember anything else, you let me know. All right? 
 Hello? 
 Yeah, Christine. 
 She said what? 
 Andrew, it's me. 
 They know you left the pub. 
 Andrew, this is DS Higgins. 
 Can you call me as soon as you get this message, please? It's urgent. 
 Where is he? 
 Jim! 
 If you could track where this guy is, please? 
 Christine's previous two husbands died. 
 There were rumours she was a black widow. Yeah, I know. She told me. 
 And she's made an official complaint about you. What? 
 She said you accused her of murder. 
 I didn't said that! 
 Well, you went through her things. 
 That's pretty unprofessional. 
 What, and you're not? 
 Why are you discounting her? 
 I'm not discounting her. 
 Why would she murder her husband, make it look like an accident and then put herself on camera? 
 Why? What is your problem? 
 Her! She's my problem! 
 This is my case. Stop harassing Christine. She came to me! 
 You were at hers when I went round. 
 That's Clint's job. 
 You're taking her word against mine? 
 I know what you're like. Excuse me? 
 A bossy, interfering, know-it-all. 
 You think you're always right. 
 She's got you wrapped round her little finger. 
 All it took was some flattery and a big pair of eyes for you to fall for it. It's embarrassing. You're embarrassing. 
 Get out. What? 
 GET OUT! 
 So tell me, Christine... 
 ..what attracted you to aging, overweight multi-millionaire Robert Talbot? 
 What's the best form of defence? 
 Attack. 
 That's why you didn't like me talking about your husbands. 
 That's why you went running to Davey. 
 Let's see. 
 Dr Everidge? Jane Kennedy. 
 Lucy. I appreciate you coming in. 
 I'd been debating whether to see you ever since I heard the news. 
 Come and take a seat. 
 Can I get you a coffee? 
 Better not. 
 Had four espressos already. 
 I've just come off a night shift. 
 I just wanted to ask you about your father. 
 You challenged the inquest verdict? 
 Yes. Christine murdered him. 
 Well, the verdict was misadventure. 
 It was a car accident. 
 He was over the limit. 
 That doesn't sound like murder. 
 She wouldn't want it to, would she? 
 Dad was a recovering alcoholic. 
 He'd been dry for 12 years. 
 AA every week. 
 Till he met her. 
 Maybe he felt he didn't need it. 
 She wanted him back on the drink. 
 She made him have the accident. 
 They went out for a meal. 
 I had a chat with the waiter. 
 She started an argument with dad. 
 He got drunk. Drove off. 
 Maybe they were arguing about his drinking. 
 The waiter said SHE kept pouring him the wine. 
 She was winding him up. 
 She knew exactly what he'd do. 
 Did you talk to the police? 
 They weren't interested. 
 How did they meet? 
 At a widow and widower's dinner. 
 Same place she met her second husband. 
 Do you know, she wasn't even widowed when she met my dad. 
 It's her hunting ground. 
 Widow and widowers? 
 Is that where she met Robert? 
 Her second husband died of a heart attack. It was natural causes. 
 He didn't have a heart condition. 
 I checked. 
 It was liquid cortonium. Too much and it induces cardiac problems. 
 The sodium levels readjust after death. There's no trace. 
 Looks exactly like a heart attack. 
 Do you have proof? 
 Possibly. 
 Can I trust you? 
 Of course. Anything you say in here is in strictest confidence. 
 I found that. 
 Under her kitchen sink. 
 It's liquid cortonium. 
 You can only get it in the States. 
 Did you take this to the police? 
 No. I... 
 I didn't exactly get it conventionally. 
 I broke in. I had to. 
 It was the only way I could find it. 
 She caught me as I was leaving, guessed what I'd done. 
 She threatened to have me arrested. 
 Struck off. 
 Her fingerprints must be all over that. 
 You're a coroner - you could take it to the police. 
 How would I explain getting it? 
 It has to be you. 
 I'd lose my job. 
 I...I want you to talk to someone. 
 A friend. 
 Strictly off the record. 
 DS Higgins? 
 Yeah? 
 It's about Robert Talbot. 
 I'm... an interested party. 
 Come in. I'd rather talk out here, actually. Keep it unofficial. 
 OK. Go ahead. 
 My father was married to Christine Talbot. 
 Christine had an injunction out against you. 
 Based on lies. 
 So you didn't stalk her or harass her? 
 As I understand it, you were lucky you weren't struck off. 
 Who was the benefactor of your father's will again? 
 Christine. 
 So if she goes down for Robert's murder, there's a fair chance she might go down for your father's as well. 
 Handy. I was asked to see you. 
 By who? 
 The coroner. She... 
 Thanks for your input. 
 Please. Don't hang up. 
 I need to see you. 
 I loved your father. 
 I had nothing to do with his death. 
 They'll work out who it was soon enough. 
 Unless it was an accident. 
 Dad was not stupid enough to get locked in a freezer. 
 Even if he was stupid enough to marry you. 
 Ouch. 
 You wanted to discuss his funeral? 
 Yes. I've, um... 
 ..talked to the crematorium. Hold on. He didn't want to be cremated. 
 I hardly think he'll mind. 
 He wanted to be buried with Mum. 
 He bought the plot the next to her. 
 I'm not burying my husband with his first wife. 
 They were married for 30 years. 
 And he was married to me when he died. So... 
 Then why the hell did you want to talk about it? 
 I, um... thought you might be interested. 
 Davey. 'Christine'. 
 Help me. 
 Help. 
 'Christine?' 
 'Christine! Christine!' 
 This is a courtesy visit. 
 Christine - she's just come out of hospital. 
 She met Andrew in a cafe and they found traces of sedatives in her coffee. 
 So no prizes for guessing who put that there. 
 She was about to drive off when she collapsed. 
 So he meant for her to have an accident. No. 
 Oh, and his alibi's fallen through. 
 Mate hasn't seen him in years. 
 So I'm going to go and arrest him now. I... 
 Like I said, courtesy visit. 
 I need to see Christine. 
 I am really sorry. 
 Me too. I got it all wrong. 
 It's Andrew, he... He... 
 He had us all fooled. Never trust a man in socks and sandals. 
 How are you? 
 Fine. 
 Shaken. 
 Um, I... 
 They're beautiful. Thank you. 
 Um... I'm sorry. 
 I should have listened to you. 
 I can understand why you had doubts. 
 Losing three husbands... 
 ..is terribly unlucky. 
 Heartbreaking. 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 I'd like to arrange Robert's funeral. 
 Of course. I'll, um... 
 I'll arrange to have his body released. 
 (Thank you.) 
 Put me on to your boss. 
 Yeah, I'll hold! 
 Mum. 
 I'm sorry. I... 
 I didn't mean to offend you. 
 Look, a barmaid sees all sides of folk. 
 We know people. 
 What they're like, what's going on. 
 It's not just, "The lager's off," and, "The loo needs more bog roll." 
 I know. 
 Friends? 
 Course we are, you daft sausage. 
 Been making a habit of upsetting people. 
 Davey and me have fallen out. 
 I was so horrible to him. 
 I'm sure he's had worse. 
 Especially from you. 
 Just buy him a pint. 
 Wish it were that simple. 
 God, I got it all wrong. 
 We all make mistakes, love. 
 Yeah, but I'm the coroner. 
 I'm not meant to make mistakes. 
 I reckon that's actually what makes you human. 
 Yeah, I do still want to hold. 
 But stop playing Chris flamin' Rea! 
 Your problem is you think about things too much. 
 You the manager? 
 No, I can't wait till the morning! 
 I got 50 in tonight. 
 If you don't fix my cooker now, I'm pulling my contract! 
 Yeah? Read the small print - you ain't fixin' it, you ain't gettin' paid. 
 Thank you! 
 Bloody cowboys. 
 Where's she gone? 
 Right, what is it? 
 Andrew's solicitor's due any minute. 
 I was just thinking - why didn't Rose get the freezer repaired that night? 
 Because there was no-one available. 
 Are you sure? 
 Believe it or not, I do know how to do my job! 
 That's them. I've got to go. 
 Davey. He's busy. 
 I need to speak to Davey. Why? 
 Andrew Talbot. 
 He is a gardener, but there is a specific thing he grows. 
 Weed. 
 The night his dad died, he was dealing. 
 To professionals. 
 Solicitors, teachers... 
 ..coroner's officers. 
 That's why no-one will admit it. 
 I saw him at 8.20. 
 I... 
 I bought a quarter off him. 
 Of course. 
 Oh, yeah - of course! 
 Please don't sack me! 
 Andrew's been arrested. 
 He hasn't done anything. 
 It was Christine! 
 Did you call Andrew to arrange the meal? 
 Can I check your phone, please? 
 It's important. It might save Andrew. 
 Of course. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Thanks. 
 I don't understand. 
 There must be some sort of mistake. 
 Andrew wouldn't do anything. 
 'Meet me at the factory at nine.' 
 Why didn't the freezer repair company come out that evening? 
 There was no-one available. 
 You could have insisted. 
 You're a big enough customer. 
 You insisted your staff get an order out after Robert died. 
 I don't think you wanted them to come. 
 Maybe that's what gave you the idea. 
 What idea? 
 'To drug Robert. 
 'And put him in the freezer. 
 'You knew Christine would make it look like an accident. 
 'Lucy told you that. 
 'So I think you staged it. 
 'We've only got your word that Robert was OK when you left.' 
 You needed an alibi. Andrew too. 
 Cos... 
 ..well, you're protective of him. 
 He's like a son. This is absurd! 
 I think you wanted me to suspect Christine. 
 Acting reluctant, making me coax information out of you about her previous husbands. 
 But Robert asked her to come here. 
 Did he? 
 'When you were in the Black Dog with Andrew, you made the call to Christine, using Robert's phone.' 
 'You're through to Christine Talbot. 
 Please leave a message.' 
 'Meet me at the factory at nine.' 
 'Meet me at the factory at nine.' 
 That message wasn't meant for Christine. 
 That was part of an old message to you. 
 Got trapped in it yesterday. 
 Go call an ambulance! 
 'And when the repairman went to call the police, you replaced Robert's phone - after freezing it at home. No wonder you were upset when Andrew left the pub. It ruined his alibi.' 
 'Why would I want to kill Robert?' 
 What, because he's selling up? 
 Cos you were in love with him. 
 What? 
 No! 
 And you thought he was in love with you, too. 
 Look how happy the two of you were. 
 Did he give you this? 
 To remember Paris? 
 That was what? 
 A month before he met Christine? 
 Before she stole him from you. 
 Made him take away your job, the only thing you had left. 
 39 years? 
 I understand - I understand why you'd want to make him pay. 
 Make her pay. 
 She won't, Rose. 
 She'll walk away. 
 Andrew will be locked up for life. 
 You can't do that to him, can you? 
 I loved Robert. 
 I gave him everything. 
 And he... 
 ..he humiliated me. 
 In front of her. 
 He treated me like I was nothing. 
 Four weeks. 
 That's all we had. 
 I was so happy. 
 Nobody knew. 
 The he went to that stupid dinner and met her. 
 And it was like we'd never happened. 
 I tried to warn him about her. 
 I said... 
 It's me he should have been warned about. 
 Oh... Oh, God. Oh, Robert! 
 What have I done? 
 What have I done?! 
 All right, so you admit to dealing? 
 But not to drugging Christine, is that right? 
 All right, let's go back to the night your father died. 
 I've told you everything. 
 Man, I've got nothing else to say! 
 Interview suspended at 17.05. 
 Right, what's up? 
 Phone call. She insists. 
 Look, Jane. What is it? I'm right in the middle of something. 
 What? 
 OK. Thank you. 
 You have to release Andrew. 
 Please! 
 He's been charged, I'm afraid. 
 Cultivation, production, intent to supply. 
 Can you take her to interview room two, please? 
 Andrew burnt his crop the other night. At Rose's suggestion. 
 You seen Clint? 
 Yeah. Just after you called. 
 It's a shame. 
 I liked working with him. 
 Well, where's he going? 
 I'm sacking him. 
 Why? 
 Cos he bought weed. 
 I'm not going to saying anything. 
 Don't need to. 
 Andrew confessed. And if we sacked everyone that bought weed, there'd be no professionals left, would there? 
 You all right? 
 You all right? 
 So did Andrew admit to drugging Christine? 
 Nah. He says he had nothing to do with it. 
 She bought the drinks, it was her prints on the cup. 
 So, I don't know how that happened yet. 
 Goodbye, Robert. 
 How was the funeral? 
 Very touching. 
 It was lovely to see Andrew. 
 Shame about the prison escort. 
 You're leaving? 
 Mm. Time to move on. 
 I fancy somewhere hot. Far away. 
 Well - poor old Rose. 
 Who would have thought? 
 I was sure it was Andrew. 
 Of course. 
 Why else would you sedate yourself? 
 Not that I can prove it. 
 You must have felt worried. 
 Cornered. 
 Such a vivid imagination. 
 You're wasted as a coroner. 
 Oh, I don't know. I find it fascinating. Reading old cases. 
 You know, if either of your first two husbands had died in my jurisdiction, we would have got to know each other rather well. 
 Really? 
 Oh, yes. 
 I would have asked a lot more questions. 
 I should've known Rose was in love with Robert. 
 People go to such extremes when they can't have someone who isn't their's. 
 Wouldn't you agree? 
 Goodbye, Christine. 
 Double rum and raisin. 
 The closest you could get to booze at 14. 
 Oh, I knew you hadn't forgotten! 
 Shopping. No excuses. Yes. 
 Words to strike terror in the heart of any man. 
 Hey, Clint. 
 I hear you're buying me pints all night. 
 Yeah, course. Anything you want. 
 Legal, obviously. 
 Clint, your filing is appalling. 
 I want you in at 8.30 to sort it. 
 Oh, thank you! 
 I'll get you your pint. Er, pints! 
 You've got to milk it. Absolutely. 
 I'm never making a cup of tea again! 
 Mum, these are for you. 
 Oh! They're beautiful. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Yeah. Don't wait up. 
 Or if you do, put your earplugs in! 
 OK, cheers. 
 We're needed in Radbury. 
 There's been a hanging. 
 Oh! It's cool. We got it. Sure? 
 Yeah. You ready? 
 Yeah. Hang on. 
 You'd better have this. 
 You always used to nick 'em, anyway! 
 Come on, then. 
 Right, shopping. So I'm thinking 60? 
 100. Maybe 100 might do. Plus 50. 
 All rise for Her Majesty's coroner.
