 Previously on "Childhood's End"... 
 They're downing all air traffic all over the world. At least 40 cities around the world now have these vessels hovering over them. My name is Karellen. I am the supervisor for Earth. Suffering will end. Injustice will end. War, famine, inequality--  these will be things of the past. It's world peace. All hold hands and sing "Kumbaya." This is an invasion. Ah! All right! I just heard they kidnapped a farmer named Richard Stormgren. There's no need to be afraid. My name is Karellen. Why are you here? We need a messenger. Gentlemen, welcome to the Golden Age of Man. Your mind just blossomed when they arrived, didn't it? They say that science is dying. So what do you want to do about that? I want to be the first person to visit their planet. Milo! No! Oh, God! No, not you. No matter how mighty the Overlords may seem, we can never give up the fight. As long as you stay hidden back here, there's always gonna be people that don't trust you. Your work is done here. What? Good-bye. [cries] There is no need to be afraid. It's now the year 2035, and just look at us. ♪ It's easy, if you try ♪ 19 years after the Overlords' arrival, four years after Karellen revealed his true form, we're living our lives under their watchful gaze. [bicycle bell rings] No inequality, no crime, no war. Our differences put aside, one society now under the auspices of the World Federation. ♪ ♪ 
♪ Imagine all the people ♪ We have renewable, clean energy and enough food to feed the planet, all of our material needs satisfied. Death is still a fact of life, but free from disease, stress, and all the things that turned us grey. We live longer, healthier lives. The birth rate is soaring. We have a world that we are proud to bring children into. For those who cling to the old ways, there's always New Athens... ♪ Nothing to kill or die for ♪ .. but for the rest of us... it's the golden age of man. ♪ And all religion too ♪ Utopia. ♪ ♪ 
♪ Imagine all the people ♪ So why am I terrified for the future? ♪ Living life in peace ♪ You might call it blissful ignorance, ♪ Ooh hoo ♪ 
♪ You might say that I'm a dreamer ♪ Even at the Boyce Institute, scientific inquiry is dying. If anything, since Karellen forged a special bond with Dr. Rupert Boyce, it's dying even faster. I want to know why. ♪ I hope someday you'll join us ♪ 
♪ And the world will live as one ♪ 
♪ ♪ Hey. Didn't realize they'd close your whole program down. Yeah, well, we designed the space orbital, and the engineers are building it. Dr. Boyce can give you another research post. I asked him. He bounced it back. The orbital's probably gonna be our last serious project. I hope I'm wrong. So that means you're leaving Africa? Yeah, maybe. I mean, what's there to keep me? Yeah, sure. Are you stealing the Titan drives? Of course not. I mean, nobody steals anything anymore, Rachel. Okay, but you-- you are stealing six petabytes of hard drive. Private research. I mean, for 20 years the Overlords have told us precisely nothing about themselves, about where they come from, about their language. I'm a guy who likes to know stuff. [door opens] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [distant thunder cracks] ♪ ♪ Don't be such a fruitcake. [crickets chirp] [whirring] [high-pitched whine] No, no, no, no, no. Don't rip my house apart again. [whirring] Thank you. [rooster crows] [horse whinnies] Very good to see you, Ricky. [giggles] Wow. So you just, uh, show up? You don't call? You don't write? You know, I never got to ask you-- I mean, you guys have-- you've done this before on other worlds, right? So... I mean, have there been other guys like me? You know, I mean, have you picked some fish guy to talk to the fish people on fish planet or something like that? How are you feeling? I'm--I feel fine. Uh, tired. I'm really tired. [grunts] Pretty much been-- been harvesting nonstop, you know, and Ellie and I are still trying to get pregnant. That's not going so well, plus the Rams have had a terrible start to their season, so this whole utopia thing's a bit of a debatable point in our house right now. You obviously didn't come here to talk about football. No, I didn't. So why are you here? To apologize. For what? Should I sugar the pill? [loud whoosh] Karellen? Yeah, yeah, everything's okay. I'm glad everything's okay. Why is it okay? No, he's just checking in on us, making sure we're all right. In the middle of the night? [dog barks in distance] Sure he was. What? Seriously, hey, everything is fine. We've found three eyewitnesses now who all saw a pod blasting away from the Stormgren farm, so it's official, sports fans. Karellen has been back to visit his blue-collar prophet after 20 years. Well, it's certainly fair to say that here on this side of the pond, curiosity is just as high as in the former U.S. According to our affiliate in Missouri, we do have confirmation now that-- We don't know what the Supervisor for Earth has told Ricky, but undoubtedly it's significant, and the world once again turns to a modest farm in Missouri. [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ Give me some credit here, Ricky. Karellen didn't come down to see if we were flossing regularly. Well, he said that the Earth has a new destiny. What does that mean? I have--I have no idea what's waiting for us. Dad, come see this. Since Karellen last visited Ricky-- Oh. It's Karellen. He's back. ...has been scientist and entrepreneur Rupert Boyce why Karellen returned to this Missouri farm-- I would not mind being a fly on that wall, huh? Yeah, it's got to be important. I mean, if he's back, something's gonna happen. Yeah, nice. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ [deep rumbling] [electric surges] [Llama screeching] [birds shrieking] [deep rumbling] [indistinct animal calls] [deep rumbling] [animals screeching] [buzzing] [monkey screeches] Dr. Boyce? Dr. Boyce? What is it? It's not us. Not an earthquake. It just appeared. Dr. Boyce? Dr. Boyce, we don't know where it came from. I know where it came from. [laughs] [grinding, scraping] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ He just built it, just like that. [laughs] Incredible. He just-- just created an entire room. Karellen said that something special was coming. I think it's magnificent. Why all this for just a child's toy? No, no, no, no, no. This is no toy. [laughs] [whirs] What's with the board, Karellen, huh? You want us talking to ghosts? It is a communication device. One assumes he wants us to talk to somebody. [dramatic music] [dogs barking] [whirring] [electrical clicking] [groaning] [whirring] [loud whoosh] We have to save the children. [panting] We have to save the children. It'll end and begin. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. [door closes] Tommy. Tommy? Tommy? Shh, all right. [whimpers] Tom? Tommy? Tommy? [glass shatters] Jesus. It will end and begin. Oh. What you doing, pal? You all right? Don't touch us. Come on, let's-- let's get you to bed. Don't touch us! [thud] [groans, coughs] [panting] Religious criticism has also expressed beliefs that the Ouija board reveals information which should only be in God's hands, and thus it is a tool of Satan." Don't know what it was. It was a-- a powerful force. From our nine-year-old son? I--I was physically attacked by something. Come on, don't start acting weird around him. I'm not acting weird. He thinks that he's done something wrong. Look, Amy, you don't remember anything of the nights recently. I do. He's walking around with that stare, and you, I mean, you're not sleeping well. I had stomach pains. You're screaming in your sleep about children, about saving children. It's like you're fighting something, and-- and Tommy's--he's not himself. I-- we could take him to see someone, but I don't know exactly what we'd say. Well, we could start with, um, "It will end and begin." I take it you're the Greggsons? Yes. And you must be Tom. Hi, we spoke on the phone. Nice to meet you in person, Miss Jones. So, uh, you're-- you're not a doctor? No, no, I'm a fully qualified counselor, one of a dying breed. I don't like it here. Tom. Our son Tommy is having some behavioral issues. Well, I think it's a little more serious than that. Mom, I want to go. I don't like it. I don't blame you, Tom. [chuckles] It's kind of a depressing place, right? You probably want to be outside or in your room at home. Why don't I come visit you there? The eyes of the macaques, you should have seen them. I saw it in a dog in the street too. It's like it wasn't even human, uh, if you know what I mean, and this is being reported across a 20-mile radius. Could it have something to do with the animals we've been collecting for the Overlords? I'm sure they were just scanning for disease or mange. Well, surely there's nothing wrong with asking Karellen. Dr. Rodricks. Isn't your wonderful work with us finished? Yes, sir, thank you, but if I could just have five minutes with the Supervi-- Dr. Osaka. Would you excuse us, please? I-- You're very much like I was, Milo, a headstrong, young biologist full of ideas and theories, burning through my inheritance, trying to make a name for myself. Yeah, peas in a pod. I understand your frustration. When the Overlords came, they raised all these exciting questions about the cosmos, but they refused to answer any of them. It's not just about me. They've killed scientific inquiry. Which is why I'm determined to stay as close to them as possible. That is why I built this place. That is why I do what they ask. I maintain as much scientific inquiry as I can. But sending live animals into space? What does that teach us about them? Because there's one species they haven't collected: us, homo sapiens. Eventually, I'll persuade Karellen to take me to his planet. I'll be the first person to see another planet lit by another sun. That's, uh-- that's incredible, Dr. Boyce. I wish you all the luck in the world. I'm telling you this because I like you, Milo, but I'm also warning you. I need Karellen on side, so don't go tugging on the lion's tail, son. [somber music] ♪ ♪ It's in my bones, and there's nothing they can do. Make the seconds count, baby, every one. [gasps] [groans] [exhales sharply] [doorbell dings] You feel more like talking today, Tom? I can't tell them what happens. Why not? They get scared if you tell them what's gonna happen. Well, I'm not your mom or your dad. You can tell me. I go places. Far away... Where it's dark and where it's hot. [thunder crashes] Far away. Maybe we should be in there. [sighs] She's a professional. If she can get him to talk, then that's got to be a good thing, right? Do you really think I'm overreacting? And what else do you see when you travel, Tom? An eye. A single giant eye. I see fire in the ground, smoke in the air. It blocks out the stars. You imagine this place? No, I go there. They take me there. Who do you think takes you there? They do. The Overlords? It's okay. Hey, Tom, it's not real. [baby crying echoing] [Peretta's voice echoes] They can't hurt you. It's in your-- Minds are funny things. They can change the way we see the world. [baby crying echoing] They can fool us. What is it? What do you hear, Tom? Tell me. Tell me what you hear. Tom, what is it? Tom? Tom, what is it? [high-pitched whine] No! Tom? No! Hey, what's wrong? [screaming] [baby crying echoing] Make it stop! What the hell did you do? Nothing, noth-- [baby crying] [screams] Listen to me. Tom, you need stop. Tom! [baby crying echoing] Just calm down. [screaming] It's not what you're-- [baby crying echoing] [choking] [gasping for air, coughing] [yelps] [Peretta panting] It's okay, mom. It's okay. The baby stopped crying. I'm-- I'm not having a baby, Tom. [Peretta panting] Hey, Peretta. Wait! Wait. Jeez, you saw that, right? What is going on? I mean, what is it? What's ha-- what's wrong with Tom? I don't know what I just saw. I have to go. No, hey, Peretta-- you're coming back, though, right? I mean, my own son is scaring me. Be safe, Jake. Bye. [screen door creaks] Hey. What's happening? Let me take your jacket here. Got it. Wow. I know he told you something, and I--I know when you're holding something back. [clears throat] Don't sugarcoat it. Listen, Els, all those times I went to the Overlord ship, um-- Hey, Ricky. Hey, Ricky! [children laugh] You got to be kidding me. [children laughing] Hey, Ricky! Get back on your side of the fence. You can't be over here. [indistinct shouting] Come on, let's go inside. What's Karellen saying? What do you people want, a sermon from the mount? Karellen tells us no more than he tells you. [intense music] ♪ ♪ [groans] [yells] [panting] Your lymph system is under huge strain. White cells are going through rapid metastasis. Now, we can drastically reduce the rate of organ decay, but, uh-- But you can't stop it. I'm afraid it also explains why you haven't been able to conceive a child. Doc, could you-- Yeah. Thanks. You can beat this. Karellen said that there was something in the fabric of the ship. It poisoned me. I don't think I can beat this, Els. You did everything that they asked of you. He won't let you down. He won't let you die. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I can't give-- No, no, no, hey, I'm sorry. Come here. This is me. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey. [Ellie sobbing] [gentle music] ♪ ♪ I need to talk to you. We never had a normal life since you chose him. We can't have real friends. We don't have children. You owe us, Karellen. ♪ People knockin' but they can't come in ♪ 
♪ People knockin' but they can't come in ♪ Help us! ♪ People knockin' but they can't come in ♪ 
♪ Come back tomorrow night and try-- ♪ Hello, stranger. Jim. What are you doing here? Someone's got to keep her spick and span. How's the congregation? Oh, we could almost muster a baseball team. We miss you, Peretta. I'm sorry. I've been busy. Why are you shaking? I thought that I was seeing a psychology case, this boy with night terrors, but it's much worse than that. It stirred up spiritual instincts, I guess, things I haven't felt in a long time. Why do they look like demons? Like our exact idea of devils? You know, every time you ask me a question, you already have an answer. That's not true. They look like our idea of devils because they've been here before. We've been waiting for them. We knew they were coming, so when they brought about this change, it scared us on some deep level because we could never stop it. That would imply some kind of crazy psychic connect-- Yes, yes, psychic connection. People have been writing about this for centuries. I mean, ancient mystics talked about an energy, a relationship between all living things and the stars themselves. Perhaps we've always known the Overlords were coming. Okay, so because of some crackpot ancient philosophy we knew they were coming to do good? So then why turn them into the personification of evil? Hmm. [thunder rumbles] Tom said he was taken here. I know it's not possible, but that's what he described. The Overlords, that there is their true colors, but you've always known that. You're being melodramatic. Your mother knew it. You used to always see things clearly through her eyes. When did you go blind? Please don't bring up my mom. She died for her faith. She killed herself because she lost it. Never apologize for your faith. Do you think that the Overlords are attacking this family? Look at your cross. They're attacking more than that. Faith is on its last legs. It's just we don't see it 'cause they give us ice cream. [heartbeat on monitor] [gasps] Oh. There she is. Oh, my gosh, is that a little hand? Yeah. Hi, baby. She's got a good, strong heartbeat. She's very pretty. [melancholy music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] Hey, come on, let's go inside. Names, names, names. Aah! [laughs] Jane? Janie? Oh! Aah! Aah! Oh! Ah! [Laughs]  Lauren. Oh! [laughs] Aah! Aah! ♪ ♪ [in German accent] Now we will soak you with the super-duper soaking device, ja? Get her, get Jennifer. Who's Jennifer? [laughs] Aah! [laughs] [ominous music] Tom just said the strangest thing. Jennifer. What? I know what to call the baby. Oh. That's where he got it from. What? I--I just thought of it then. No, you must have mentioned it before. It just popped into my head, divine inspiration. No, Amy, you mentioned it to Tom. No, Jacob, I didn't. Do you like it? Jennifer. Yeah. This is the problem. We're gonna live forever, but we don't have enough to do. No wonder we feel like we're going out of our minds. You're not going out of your mind. Tom asked me the other day if he'd ever have a job... I told him he didn't need one. What kind of a message is that? We need to reclaim some of what we had when we were kids. I see where this is going. Look, I made some calls. Hold those horses. We're not moving to New Athens. Just to visit, to see it, living life the old way. There's crime in New Athens. God, I hope so, and litter and hot dog stands, which are notoriously bad for you. And you love. You know what else they have? They have art, and they have culture, and they're awake, Amy. It might be good for all of us to remember how things once were, you know? Warts and all. Do I seem happier to you? Yes. Am I still fighting demons in the dark? No. It's the baby, baby. She's gonna change everything for us. Bless'd Holy Mother, send thy angels to defend us. All ye holy angels, arch-- [whirring] 
 
 [pounding on door] Hey! It's them! Peretta? It's them, the Overlords. Hey, just turn your dial down. What about them? Are you hurt? What is going on? We're not hurt. I don't know, I don't know, but they were here. The Overlords were here. Their pod was here watching the house. What about Tom? Is Tom all right? Yeah, calm down. Peretta... just keep your voice down. I'm not a hysterical person! I am a person with faith. When I was in your house last time... I felt something, and it did this. Uh, well, um... things are much better since that day, Peretta. Tom's much better, actually, and, uh, you bringing it all up again is, uh, just-- it's gonna upset him. There's no such thing as evil, Peretta. We're--we're fine. Our family is fine. Come inside, please? Yeah. Well, since that day I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Tom told me they take him somewhere, to a place of fire and smoke-- If this is your idea of counseling, then no wonder it's a dying profession! And he is scared! Thank you for your spiritual concern, Peretta, but, uh, my son does not take night trips to hell. Thank you. [door slams, lock clicks] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ A paranormal eye to the soul or just a... harmless board game? I finalized the guest list. Good. I need to add these people to the guest list. We're bringing these people all the way out to Africa? Apparently this is where the connection is strongest. Connection to what? Look, just get them here, all right? The father's not important, but the mother and the child, they have to be here. Do you understand? This room was built for them. Sir, it's not my place to question, but can't you demand that-- No. You don't make demands of Karellen. ♪ ♪ The Overlords are deceiving us. I don't know why, but they are. Where it seems that the crowds are growing. Right Mark? Yes, as the newly energized pilgrimage continues to take hold... Followers and attractors are asking the same question: Why would the Overlords allow their prophet to suffer? There has been a great outpouring of support for Ricky Stormgren since his return home from the Hapstead Hospital just six months ago. [exhales sharply] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [overlapping chatter] ♪ ♪ Jake Greggson? Yeah. My name is Morton. I work for Dr. Rupert Boyce. Rupert Boyce? I know that name. He wants to redesign his game reserve in the Haansvelt, South Africa. We're inviting several designers to come visit. I, uh--I do golf courses. Lot of people play golf these days. You don't fancy a fresh challenge? That's a long way to come when you could have phoned. Well, I had other business in California. Hello. You must be Amy. Hi. This gentleman wants to fly me to South Africa for a job interview designing, um, a game reserve? The whole family's invited, big party, kids can see the animals. The other candidates will be there too. Sounds amazing. Yeah, a little too amazing. There aren't that many guys doing what you're doing, Jake. You're special. I'll think about it. Of course. If you're not comfortable flying out, then that's fine. Uh... What's the matter with you? You say you're bored out of your mind. Just pitches up and says he's flying us to Africa. Come on. What's the worst that could happen? Go to a party in a beautiful place? Jake, this is the adventure you've been looking for, don't you think? Hey, wait, Morton? [overlapping chatter] Please just let me get by, okay? Just let me through, guys, okay? Look, it's just my-- it's just my shopping, okay? It's really not that interesting. Any word? Oh, my God. Please just leave it. Just leave it, please. I'm fine. It's fine. Let me help. I'm fine. Okay, I'll get out of your face. I'm sorry. I'm impressed. You're doing great. Can you juggle the apples while you do that too? How about this? I will take the bike. I'll wheel it to your front door, and then you can frog-march me off your land. Yeah. These children, they shouldn't be here. None of you should. It really doesn't achieve anything. Oh, I didn't come with them. I'm a counselor. I just thought these people seemed a little lost, like they might need some support. I mean, you and Ricky, you must feel pretty isolated out here. Thanks, I can take it from here. "The golden dawn comes shining from the eyes of God." Oh. [beeping] Hey. Hey. Want to hear what I found in this text "Corpus Hermeticum?" I love discussing the Corpus Hermeticum on a Saturday night. I mean, what girl doesn't? But do you want to go to the party with me? I mean Kerlin might be there and everyone else from the center is bringing their significant other... Not, I mean, not that we're um.. Uh... uh, yeah. Great. All : Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Okay, side to side, and-- All : Jump! And... [overlapping shouts] Yeah, it can feel like a fortress here. Everybody wants something. A little communion wine? Amen. What is that? Aguardiente. My mother used to take a drop every Saturday night. Not too many drops, I hope. Oh, I'm sorry. Is she... My mom was a missionary, and when Karellen arrived, he killed the need for God, and so she killed herself. Oh, Peretta, I'm sorry. But I'm not sure that God ever really helped any of us. I don't-- I don't believe that. He gave us diseases, and when we found cures for those, he created new ones. God was just this black void that we cried into, but only the Overlords answered. But, hey, if God wants to trump Karellen, bring it on. Isn't there something in the Bible about barren women having children? If God's selling, then I'm buying. You can't have children? I should go. [helicopter whirring] Giraffes.

Sure. Morton, would you mind escorting this young man to our exhibit room? You are gonna love it, lions and tigers and bears, oh, my. Absolutely. Hey, don't touch anything. It might bite. He'll be fine. So, um, how do you want to play this, Dr. Boyce? I actually took the liberty of sketching a few ideas-- Let's just enjoy the party, shall we? Mrs. Greggson, if I may? Sure. I promise I'll bring her back. Dostoyevsky, Orwell, Dickens' stories came from characters rising above their situation, but who'd write "Hard Times" now? Armistead Maupin wrote about the stigma of being gay. My partner and I can kiss in the street without raising a hair. What the hell would Maupin write about now?

He's not taking people on. Not taking people on? Then why the hell are we here? I should probably get back inside. Uh, here's my card. Let me know how it turns out. [whirring] [whirring continues] Hey, Tom back? Not yet. Look, um... I don't think this is about a job interview. I don't know what it's about. Want to get out of here? Yeah. I'll go find Tom.

[claps] If I could have your attention, please? I know we've all been waiting, so without any further delay, I'd like to introduce our special guest. I give you the Supervisor for Earth. [crowd murmuring] [gasps] [cheering, applause] Good evening, everyone. So... you have solved many of the problems your science was chasing. Disease, climate change, and as a consequence, much of your research is now redundant. Nevertheless, you should be proud of what you have accomplished. Bravo. Now, I know there's been some concern as to why I acquired so many animals for the Overlords. They are to be shipped to Karellen's home world as part of a great menagerie, a zoo. [crowd murmuring] They will not be harmed and they will live longer-- Supervisor, I wanted to-- um, I wanted to ask about the-- Not now, Rodricks. You're killing scientific curiosity. I admire the work you have done, but your scientific curiosity has led you dangerously close to forces that you could never have controlled. They would have destroyed you. They saved us from ourselves. Why are we being kept in the dark? You now have peace, and the way has been prepared for your successors. I'd like to thank everybody who worked on the World Federation Observation Orbital. I'd like to probably turn that into an acronym as well. [crowd murmuring] [clears throat] Um... and, uh, please enjoy the rest of the evening. [crowd murmuring] Mrs. Greggson, I realize this might seem like an odd request, but the Supervisor would like to meet with you... privately. Oh, uh, I'm sorry, why does he want to meet with me? I'm not entirely sure, but if I were you, I'd take it as a compliment. Dinosaurs ruled the world for 200 million years. What happened to them? I guess they just had their time. Wait a second. I've been here. I've seen these. Now, hold on, son. I want to find Dad. Just-- just give them more time. More time for what, Mr. Morton?

[whirrs] [thunder crashes] [crowd murmurs] [whirring] Karellen? Listen to my voice. [Amy breathing unevenly] You're trying to be a child, but you cannot be a child knowing yourself as you do. Tom? Listen to my voice. This has to stop. [whirring] [Amy breathing unevenly] Accept who you are. You're hurting her. Don't-- Touch us! [crowd gasps, murmuring] [groans] [whirring] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I hear you. I'm coming. [whirring] ♪ ♪ Tom! [whirring] [murmuring] ♪ ♪ Tom, wait! Tom! Tom! Jump. She's awake. No! [woman screams] [panting] [overlapping chatter] Tom! [dramatic music] [whirring] It is done. She is awake. She accepts, and she understands. Now they will follow. [panting] Tom, hey, buddy. Hey, hey. Tom? Hey. Hey, Tom? Hey. Hey. Tom? [crying] Dad. Hey. Oh. Dad, I'm so sorry. It's Jennifer. She's so strong. No, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. It's their alphabet. That's what it is. It's their alphabet. Can I--sorry. Have you got something to write with? Anything, like a pen, something? I... um. Lipstick, yeah, that's perfect. Oh, that-- Sorry, it was a connection. What we saw was a conversation between down here and something up there using their language. That's Herve Leger Red, and it's my favorite. All right, so each symbol is a--is a letter in their alphabet, and I think that they based their alphabet on constellations. That's why you draw all over your star charts. I've charted every letter I can find. This one is new. I recognize the pattern, Rachel. We got to go. We have to go. Okay. Amy? Jake? Jake. Amy. Honey. Please, please can we just go? Okay, yeah. Stay away from us. Tom? Why would Karellen want to connect with your unborn child? Ames, keep walking. What is it you're carrying? I saw something, a vision, a--I don't even know. Hey, let's go. Come on. I'm sorry. What was it I saw, Amy? [Amy groaning] [Amy screams in pain] You see? Now you see, each symbol is a star system, but none of them can support planetary life, which I found odd. So this symbol, this letter-- Only it's not a symbol. It's a constellation, the Carina System. This one is different. It's the only system with planets. [laughs] [keyboard keys clacking] [Amy screaming in pain] That is the home world of the Overlords. [serene music] ♪ ♪ [gunshot] Son of a bitch. [static feedback on radio] [cheering, applause] [overlapping chatter] [cheering, applause continues] All right, all right, settle down. I need to get through. No one's getting through. She's my friend. She needs me. Call me crazy, but I'd hoped you'd be back. Ah, better to embrace acceptance than hope, Ricky. Well, don't knock it. It worked. [sighs] When you disappeared all those years ago, I kind of felt offended. I guess I got used to being pals with God. Whenever you summon God, you want comfort... Yet the very idea of him makes you confused and afraid. He is a stick you feel you must lean on... But the stick burns. [inhales sharply] On the bench. It is for you. What is it? Ricky, we have no need to apply our resources to save our own lives. Will it save my life? This can repair the damage to your body. It's very difficult to make. This is all there is of it. [door opens] Forgive me, we should have met sooner. Yes, we should have. It's been hard, what Ricky has had to do. It's harder still on the one who has to wait, the one who can only watch but never follow. It is even harder on those who cannot accept. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, who's this? Peretta, what are you doing here? Whatever it promised you, it is a lie. You lied to them! You lied to us all! They deserve the truth. You made your prophet sick. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. They can't have children. Tell them the truth about what you really are! The truth? The truth is that your illness did not make you sterile. That was my doing. You said that that was from going to the ship. That it was a mistake. No. I have stopped you having children. Ellie. Maybe you don't know as much as you think about us, Karellen, but you see that we are meant to have children. To raise and to love and to watch grow. Yes. You robbed us of a family after everything we did for you! Hey, let it go. Let it--let it go. No! No, they never wanted what was best for us. They want to destroy us. How could you do this? I sold you to the world. The day is coming, Ricky, when your world will change forever. It will be harder on those who have children. I cannot stop that, we are not masters but merely the servants, but I could spare you the pain of being parents. No, how dare you? It is not your right to decide! No. Enough! [female vocalizing] [gasping for air] Oh, my friend... I just wanted to spare you... the pain of what is coming. What's coming? Karellen, what happens to the children? I chose you. In all the world, I chose you. [wheezing] Let it die! [gasps for air] [inhales deeply] [crying] No. No. No. Whether I am alive or dead makes no difference to what is coming. You will never take away my faith. All the world's religions cannot be right, Peretta. You know that. [crying] Your faith is beautiful as poetry is beautiful... but there is no place for it now. [crying] You deceived us! No, you have deceived yourself. No. [foggy music] ♪ ♪ Nine million species... how'd he pick them? Was it just a random lottery? Out of a hat? Who, Karellen? Noah, for his ark. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Peretta. Mom. [Amy screaming in pain] Okay now, okay. Go ahead now, push. Again. [Amy continues screaming] Hang in there. Concentrate, come on. Push. There you go, that's it. You're almost there. Come on, now. You're almost there. Here we go. One more push, Amy. She's almost here. She's coming! There we go. Good girl. All right, there she is.
