 And the forecast today is sunshine and scorching hot temperature as we continue to experiencing a major heat wave here in the city. 
 Expect temperatures to rise... 
 Why is it so hot in here? 
 Please tell me that's not our air conditioner. 
 Dad? Hey, guys. 
 This is your AC condenser from out back. 
 Zoe asked me to swing by and check on the place while she's on vacation and I could hear this baby chugging from a mile away. 
 So you decided to take it apart? I'm fixing it. 
 We should call a repair guy. 
 Yeah. And why? 
 Have him charge you an arm and a leg to tighten up a couple of screws? Nah, I'll have this baby fixed in no time. 
 Well, the good news is, it's the end of the day. 
 How could it possibly get any worse? 
 Ooh! There they are, right there! 
 There they are! My two favourite PIs! 
 In the house! 
 Conroy? Hey, is it hot in here or is it just me? 
 Who is Mr. Margaritaville? Dad, this is Deputy Eddie Conroy. 
 We met him last year up at Preston Hall. 
 Pleasure to meet you, sir. 
 We all solved a murder together. It was pretty awesome. 
 Maybe not for the dead guy. 
 Probably the victim's husband, too, and... not very fun for any of the hotel guests who... 
 Conroy, what brings you to the big city? 
 Oh. OK. I got a case for you guys. 
 Oh, darn. 
 We are totally slammed right now. Totally slammed. 
 You are? Yep. 
 Slammed. 
 Right. Yeah, I should have supposed. 
 I mean, you guys are the best, so... 
 OK, well, very nice to meet you, and sorry to bother you. 
 OK. 
 Ugh! Wait, wait. 
 What's going on, Conroy? 
 OK. Let me tell you about Estelle Warren. 80-year-old woman, has this cozy little cabin on the outside of town, in the woods. 
 She was robbed? Oh no, no, no... She lived alone, she had a bad hip, had trouble getting down the lane to get her mail. 
 I used to go by once a week with the mail... 
 OK, hold up. 
 Why are you speaking in the past tense? Did something happen to her? 
 Oh, yes, yes, absolutely. She was murdered. 
 And I think it was my fault.

 When you tune in next week, I'll explain how this boat and this notorious murderer are connected. 
 Is that Jack the Ripper? Because I always thought that... 
 Shh. This part is really important. 
 I have been revealing too many truths, haven't I? 
 Who have I pissed off? 
 CSIS? NSA? 
 Hey... I saw your brown truck parked on the street the other night in front of my house. 
 This was the last vlog she ever made. 
 See, in the Titanic movie, Leo's name was Jack. 
 Keep going, Conroy. A week before she died, Estelle told me about this brown truck. 
 I mean, she was always going on about conspiracy stuff, so I didn't take her seriously. 
 And then, she was murdered? Yeah. 
 No. I mean, I don't know. 
 My Sergeant found Estelle in her garage with her car running. 
 It was ruled a suicide. 
 That's tough, man. I'm sorry. Nah, look... 
 I refuse to believe that she took her own life. 
 If I'd just listened to her about that dark brown truck, she could still be alive right now. 
 This is why I need you guys to help me with this. 
 You want us to investigate a murder up in... 
 Willowton. Willowton. 
 But Estelle's grandniece lives here. Maybe she knows something? 
 I think her name is Maude. 
 Oh, and I've got the license plate number for the truck. 
 Why didn't you run the plate yourself? 
 Yes, right. About that. 
 I was, uh... suspended. 
 Conroy. 
 I know. Boss was fed up about the fact that I wouldn't let it be, and then I ordered an autopsy behind her back. 
 She suspended me before it came through. Look. You guys are the only people I know that can help me with this, so... please. 
 Just one second. 
 So, what do you think? No. 
 Don't you feel bad for him? Yes. 
 Which is why we can't humour this wild goose chase. 
 You know your air flow regulator is shot, right? 
 Yes, I know. Cool. 
 OK, fine. Take him around for the day, then go buy him a beer. 
 I'll look into the niece. OK, but I was thinking maybe you could take him around and I will go see the... niece. 
 Guess that means no. 
 So this isn't one of those real Porsches, huh? 
 This is one of those fake kit things? 
 It's a real Porsche. Oh yeah? 
 Oh, that's cool. That's pretty cool. 
 I drive a Corolla myself. Corolla? 
 Wow. That's a... reliable car. 
 Oh, you can say that again. Seventeen faithful years and counting, my friend. 
 Look. Thanks again, huh? Not everybody, um... really takes me that seriously. 
 It's no problem, man. 
 I can tell Estelle meant a lot to you. 
 Hey, when we're done with this, what're the chances you'd let me take this baby for a spin? 
 Zero. OK. 
 Wow! Oh, wow! (LAUGHING) 
 Look at this place! Whoo! 
 First time in a police station? Oh no, no, not me. I'm a cop. 
 Is Maz here? He's on a training session. 
 Oh. Uh... You know what would be great? 
 If you could look up a license plate number for us. 
 I've got it right here. 
 Didn't you just say you were a cop? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Inspector Carson! What's going on here? 
 I can tell you. Shade and Everett are looking into a lead about the murder of my friend Estelle. 
 Nice to meet you. I'm Deputy Eddie Conroy. 
 Murder? Possible murder. 
 Highly unlikely murder. We're helping our... very special friend Eddie. 
 Eddie just lost someone very special to him. 
 Hey, no. That's private. 
 He's struggling with acceptance. 
 I'm going around the corner to yell at someone. 
 When I come back, don't be here. 
 I believe that was her way of turning a blind eye. 
 How come someone in Willowton isn't looking into this? 
 Not many of us at the station. It's a pretty small town. 
 I've got the number for you right here. 
 OK, well, there's nothing coming up with a brown truck under this license plate. 
 Well, I appreciate you honestly taking a look... 
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
 Can you run that plate again with different colours? 
 I just totally forgot that Estelle was completely colourblind. 
 So you might want to try blue and red, maybe. 
 Also, Estelle's pretty significantly dyslexic, so these letters could very well be wrong. 
 I'll give you a couple suggestions. Um... 
 So just that I'm clear, we're just shooting aimlessly here and hoping for a bullseye? 
 That pretty much covers it. 
 Uh-huh. OK, try that out. 
 Nope, not that one. 
 Oh. 
 Well, there is a blue pick-up truck that matches this plate number. 
 It's registered to a towing company out in Scarborough. 
 8356... 
 Commission Road South. 
 I knew it! Yeah, we gotta go. 
 Inspector. 
 Ahh... Air conditioning. 
 You must be Angie. Fiona. 
 Fiona? 
 Deputy Conroy said your name was Maude. 
 Deputy Conroy? 
 The police officer who was friends with your great-aunt? 
 Oh, right. He's a funny little man, that one. 
 I'm still trying to wrap my brain around all of this. 
 Aunt Estelle was a kook, but I didn't think she was capable of... taking her own life. It's thanks to her that I was able to start my catering business, actually. 
 Oh, did she leave you money in her will? 
 No, before that. She sent me $2,000 a month to keep me going until we got up on our feet. 
 Wow. That's quite the allowance. 
 Aunt Estelle was incredibly generous. 
 Do you have any idea where the money was coming from? 
 I assumed her savings? 
 Didn't have any kids or a partner to give it to. 
 And actually, she increased the cheques to 2,600 a month a little while ago. 
 Did she say why? No. 
 Now that I think about it, maybe she was planning this. 
 Don't people usually give things away before they...? Yeah. Did Estelle have any friends? 
 Not really. 
 There was a name she'd mention every once in a while. 
 Betty Love. I think I have her email address. 
 Great. 
 Anybody home? 
 It's abandoned. 
 Glad we came. How about we go get that beer? It's on me. 
 There's a great pub right near the agency. 
 Good God, no. 
 That's fresh oil. 
 That's fresh oil. Seriously? 
 You think you're gonna follow an oil trail and find a blue truck? 
 This isn't Scooby-Doo, man. 
 Boo-yah! 
 Whoa, whoa, just calm down, Don Ho. Let's examine the facts. 
 A, this truck is a different colour than the one Estelle described, and B, that license plate is a different number than the one that was written down in Estelle's journal. 
 Hey! Who are you guys? 
 I'm Deputy Conroy, Willowton Police. 
 We're just looking at this truck here which might be involved in a murder case. 
 Wow, you just give it all away for free, don't you? 
 Could we, um, talk to the owner of this fine establishment? 
 OK, just let me make a phone call. 
 Betty Love? I'm Angie Everett, private investigator. 
 I can come back later. 
 Well, you'll be waiting for quite a while. 
 I'm training for a marathon. 
 Oh! 
 So you wanted to talk about Estelle? 
 Yes. That must have come as quite a shock. 
 When you get to my age, you have to just gain a certain amount of acceptance. 
 My friend Rosemary died six weeks ago from that terrible flu that was going around. Just have to keep moving. 
 I'm not sure if you're aware, but the cops who found Estelle, they... they believe she committed suicide. 
 And you want to know if that's possible. 
 Well, she said she never wanted to be a burden. 
 I could see maybe if she was diagnosed with something terminal, she might take things into her own hands, but... 
 Do you know if that was true? She never said anything to me. 
 OK, well, thank you. I'll see myself out. 
 Oh, uh... 
 One more thing. Do you happen to know of anyone related to Estelle by the name of Maude? 
 Maude? No. No, never heard the name. 
 What is up with this guy? My spidey senses are going off. 
 You know, I never had those. 
 Yeah, OK. Yeah, he's around back, guys. 
 Just set down back there. He's expecting ya. 
 Just around the corner. Be right with ya. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) 
 Don't answer that. 
 Aw, shoot. Not you shoot... I meant, you know, shoot... 
 OK, shut up. Just throw the phone on the ground. 
 Wallet, bag, car keys. Look, man, we can talk about this... 
 Get in the shipping container, both of you. Now! 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) 
 [This is Matt Shade. Leave a message.] 
 Hey, it's me. I'm just checking in. 
 I haven't come up with much on my end. 
 I'm calling it a night. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Look, man, we can just walk away and not tell anybody about this... 
 OK. Or we can get in the container. 
 Entirely up to you. 
 Oh my gosh! I was right, wasn't I? 
 It WAS a murder! 
 And it's another hot one out there today, folks. 
 Sticky and humid. 
 The temperatures again in the high thirties throughout... 
 Hello? 
 Yeesh. It's hotter than Trinidad in here. 
 Yeah, I hadn't noticed. 
 OK, I'm on it. 
 See I got the parts and I found a manual online that should speed things up. 
 Oh, good. Don, this is in Spanish. 
 I know. It's all I could find. Hey, have you heard from Shade? 
 No, I don't think he came home last night. 
 I figured he was out late with you working a case. 
 No. No, I called his phone, it went straight to voicemail. 
 You know what? I'm gonna head downtown, talk to Maz, see if he knows where Shade and Conroy are. 
 And I'm gonna get started on this. Great. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Oh... what time is it? 
 Ten after eight. Oh, man! 
 This heat really did me in. 
 Slept like a baby. How about you? 
 (GRUNTING) 
 I'm sorry. This is all my fault. 
 I didn't think that the end would unfold like this. 
 I turn forty tomorrow, you know. 
 Every man in my family dies before they turn forty. 
 It's the Conroy curse. 
 The what? Conroy curse. 
 Granddaddy Conroy fell down a well. 
 They said he shouted a bit, but Granny was pretty deaf by then. 
 My uncle died at Christmas when the tree he was chopping down fell on top of him. 
 And good ole Dad... he was electrocuted to death while he was fixing his television set. 
 Yeah. 
 It was a tow truck company out in Scarborough. 
 And Shade didn't mention if he was going anywhere else after? 
 You mean with Ace Ventura? 
 'Cause of the Hawaiian shirt and the weird... No, he didn't mention where he was going after that. I need you to make a phone call. 
 I need the police report for Estelle Dorset. 
 Are you thinking there's actually something to this murder idea? 
 I haven't talked to Shade since yesterday afternoon. 
 I know it sounds crazy, but Conroy might be onto something. 
 Willowton, right? Yeah. 
 Thank you. Just call me when you get the report. 
 Awkward, when you say bye and then walk in the same direction. 
 Well, I can't let you go to a tow truck company in the middle of nowhere by yourself. 
 I'm gonna go with you. Oh, you don't need to do that. 
 Well, I actually sent Shade and the other cop out there, so if anything has happened, I do need to know about it. 
 Cool. Cool. 
 Oh, sushi. 
 Flying in an airplane. 
 Never learning the difference between effect with an 'e' and affect with an 'a'... 
 I don't know, there's so much stuff. What about you? 
 Huh? I don't even know what game we're playing. 
 Do you have any regrets? We're playing regrets right now. 
 No, I don't believe in them. 
 They're only opportunities for learning. 
 Really? 
 What about, like, Angie? What about Angie? 
 OK, come on. You're gonna sit there and tell me that you never, ever, ever... thought about being with Angie? Ah! 
 Ah, right there! See? Right there. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Could we just focus on getting out of here? 
 I get it, I get it. Love is tough. It's very tough. 
 In my graduating class in high school there was one girl, and she was my twin sister Edie. 
 Wow... 
 I mean, yes, at the Police Academy, there was a woman. 
 I never had the courage to ask her out. 
 Ever. Darla. 
 And every month there's this singles mixer in the curling club down the road and they say that she goes, and every month I say that I'm gonna go, but every month, I just chicken out. 
 And now it just seems so... stupid. 
 Hey. Hey. Magnum? 
 Listen to me. 
 We're getting out of here. And when we get out of here, you're going to go to that singles mixer. 
 You know how I know that? 
 How? 'Cause I'm gonna take ya. 
 I'm a good wingman. (WHIRRING SOUND) 
 You hear that? Yeah. 
 He's coming back. 
 Alright. When he comes through that door, I'm gonna take him on, and you hit him with this. 
 What? Yeah. 
 God... You ready? 
 No. 
 OK... 
 (BANGING ON CONTAINER) You guys still in there? 
 No. I mean... 
 I'm not dead. The other guy... very much dead. He's super dead. 
 I personally do not... do not feel very good at all. 
 Hey, listen, you let us go now and it'll all be OK. 
 You don't have to kill anyone. 
 And we will not call the cops. 
 What's going on out there? What is going on out there? 
 Let's just say you should buckle up. 
 So what's with the go bag? 
 Oh, I've been prepped to investigate a murder since I was in high school. 
 Oh! You always wanted to be a cop? 
 It was either that or go into the family business. 
 Which was? Carpet cleaning. 
 Ah. 
 After I graduated, my dad offered me a job answering phones and said if I worked hard enough, in a few years he would promote me to sales. 
 So I enrolled in the Police Academy the next afternoon. 
 Hello? 
 They're not here. (PHONE CHIMING) 
 There's no sign of them. They must have come and gone. 
 Oh, police report from Willowton. 
 There's an accompanying autopsy report for a suicide? 
 Oh yeah, that would have been ordered by our good friend Deputy Conroy behind his Sergeant's back. 
 Well, apparently it was good reason. She had a clean bill of health, but according to the autopsy, she had a high dose of benzodiazepine in her system. 
 A sedative? She was found in her car. 
 Both benzo and carbon monoxide will put you to sleep. 
 You wouldn't need to use both. 
 I think we need to take a visit to Willowton to see the medical examiner. 
 Exactly what I was thinking. 
 Hey there. 
 The receptionist is on her lunch break. Who're you? 
 We're looking for Sergeant Lydia Sullivan? 
 You can't pee here. There's a gas station five minutes up the road. 
 I'm Detec... 
 Trainee Detective Danica Powers from Metro PD. 
 You're a long way from the city. 
 I'm actually friends with Eddie Conroy. 
 He came to us about Estelle's death. 
 Suicide, you mean? Poor kid won't let it go. 
 We caught him breaking into her house in search of 'evidence', and then he had the audacity to order an autopsy behind my back. 
 About that autopsy. Have you had a chance to review it yet? 
 Does it look like I have all the time in the world? 
 Um, could we talk to the Medical Examiner? 
 Conroy? No. The Medical Examiner. 
 Yeah. Conroy! Yeah, be right there. 
 Thought I heard Toronto folk. What can I do for you? 
 You're Eddie's...? 
 Sister. Twin, actually. Older by two minutes. 
 Took his sweet time coming out the ol' birth canal. 
 That explains a lot. 
 Uh, and you're the Medical Examiner? 
 Town vet, too. And doctor. 
 Incredible. The autopsy you prepared... 
 What can you tell us about the sedatives you found in Estelle's system? 
 Did she have a prescription for Benzodiazepine? 
 I never wrote her one. 
 Doesn't mean she couldn't have gotten some from the local drug dealer, though, huh? 
 I don't push pills, that's Old Man Pitfield. 
 Listen, if you want to go about your own investigation, be my guest. 
 I'll give you the keys to Estelle's place. 
 Telling you, though, won't find anything... 
 Lonely conspiracy nut who offed herself. 
 Sad but true. 
 Thanks. Thank you. 
 (BANGING AND YELLING) Help! 
 (YELLING) 
 You have mosquito repellent in your detective kit? 
 You know what the most deadly creature on earth is? 
 Next to humans, of course... mosquitos. 
 You're welcome. Hm! 
 Ugh, terrible service out here. 
 OK... 
 - Parrilla de flujo de aire? Air... something. 
 Yeah, I got that much. 
 Grandpa, I don't know. I went to Italy, not Spain. 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Don, just checking in. Any news? 
 No, nothing yet. 
 Did you hear from Jules? [Yeah.] 
 Who's on the phone? Is it Dad? It's Angie. 
 Angie, hello? 
 Hello? 
 Hello? (BEEPING) 
 Call dropped. 
 It's gonna be OK, kid. It's gonna be OK. 
 Anything? No, I lost the call. 
 What did you lose back there? 
 Oh, just the engagement ring I bought for my girlfriend. 
 What? Did you find it? No. It's fine, though. 
 It's a 10-dollar ring from Kensington Market. I'll buy her a new one. 
 She's really against diamonds and she's not really a jewelry person. 
 I didn't know you were getting married. Congratulations. 
 I don't know if I am yet. 
 I've had the ring in my bag for two months now. 
 You take the bathroom, I'll take the bedroom. 
 No Benzo yet! 
 Same. And they didn't find any in the car with her, so where the hell is it? 
 This definitely seems like a murder case to me. 
 And not just because I've been hoping for one. 
 So your girlfriend... Kate. 
 Does she know you're going to propose? 
 She has no idea. 
 It's silly, really. It's probably just an overreaction. 
 To what? Her leaving. 
 She's a war correspondent. 
 She's heading to Damascus next week, and every time she goes, I get this horrible feeling in my stomach like I'm never gonna see her again. 
 I'm so sorry. I didn't think. 
 No, no, no, it's OK. 
 When did you know that Kate was "the one"? 
 Well, I'd just been turned down for my fifth straight patrol job. 
 That night, she took me out for dinner and she told me that, no matter what, she would always believe in me. 
 And that was it. 
 Hey, look at that grate. 
 Looks like it's been moved. 
 Estelle, you sneaky little bugger. This is really old. 
 Mineral Ore Deposit Property Ventures? 
 Estelle went to lot of trouble to hide these things. 
 (YELLING AND BANGING) 
 Hey! Gosh! Hello! 
 (REVERSE BEEPING SIGNAL) 
 Somebody!! 
 (DRILLING) 
 Hey! What are you doing? 
 Making some air holes for ya. 
 Hey, I gotta admit, I went through your wallet, Matt Shade. 
 Matt Shade... you're the hockey player! 
 Yeah, that's right. I am. 
 Aw, man, I still remember that playoff game where you scored the winning goal. Knocked it right out of midair. 
 That was incredible. What? 
 Thanks? It's too bad I gotta kill you. 
 Come on, man. 
 You don't have to do that. Look, I know you're just a hired gun. 
 You let us out of here and we'll help you take down your boss together. 
 No can do, man. She'd kill me, too. 
 She? What? 
 OK, thanks. 
 So it looks like it's a real estate holdings company that pays out dividends to its investors. 
 Did you figure out how many people are invested in the company? 
 That's the weird part. There's only four: 
 Estelle Dorset, Betty Love, Rosemary Dupond, and Alice Van Horn. Do you know them? 
 Yeah. I already talked to Betty and she mentioned her friend Rosemary, who died 6 weeks ago. 
 Of what? 
 Betty mentioned the flu. 
 And let me guess: no autopsy was done. 
 And the monthly dividend payments went up right after Rosemary's death. 
 But why? 
 Maybe they had life insurance policies on each other? 
 That's not how life insurance works. 
 We need to talk to the fourth woman. 
 Alice Van Horn. 
 A 6-letter word for "tap." 
 Has an "F" and a "C" in there. 
 It's "faucet", Mom. 
 
 
 
 Oh, hello. You must be the investigators that called. 
 Yes. I'm Angie. 
 This is Officer Powers. 
 Trainee Detective Powers. Hello! 
 Is she...? 
 Not much of a conversationalist, but I can try and help you. 
 Oh, yeah, sure. Um... 
 We're looking into a financial investment your mother was involved in that's been linked to a possible murder. 
 Do you know anything about Mineral Ore Deposit Property Ventures? MOD. 
 "MOD"... 
 Mineral Ore Deposit is "Maude". 
 That's the name that Conroy heard Estelle talking about. 
 Betty did us good. 
 Oh, she was such a schemer, that one. 
 Rosemary? 
 Rosemary? No, Ma. 
 This isn't Rosemary. Rosemary... 
 She's been struggling with Alzheimer's for a long time now. 
 She doesn't know much of what's she's saying these days. 
 I'm sorry, did you say murder? 
 Should I be worried about my mother's safety? 
 We're gonna talk to the staff in the building and see if there's any additional precautions they can take. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, I have to get her to her physiotherapy appointment. 
 Excuse me. 
 This is my card. 
 If she says anything about MOD, please call me. 
 When I talked to Betty, she said she'd never heard of 'MOD'. 
 All I can see is gravel and water. 
 Whoa... OK, what is happening? 
 I don't know, but that can't be good. 
 Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no... What is it? 
 I'm starting to think that these aren't air holes. 
 We know about your MOD investment. 
 Well. 
 Is there something we can help you find? 
 Oh, it's my pills. They're in here somewhere. 
 I have to take one every couple of hours. Oh, here they are. 
 Why didn't you tell me about this when we met yesterday? 
 Because it's none of your business. 
 Did you murder Estelle and Rosemary? 
 (SCOFFING) I most certainly did not! 
 And you watch your tone, young miss. 
 We were best friends. 
 I mean, sure, over the past couple of decades we grew apart, but from the early 70s through the millennium, those women were my family. 
 We took care of each other. 
 And then MOD took care of us. 
 So you admit to the investment scheme. Listen, you just need to come clean with us. 
 Somebody's trying to kill its members. 
 So you think Estelle's death was actually a murder? 
 We strongly believe so, yes. 
 Then I guess I'd better tell you... 
 Betty? Betty? 
 My heart... Betty, what's going on? 
 I'm calling an ambulance. 
 OK, you might have been right. I don't think this is working. 
 I just think it's soaking through. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Come on! 
 Betty's stable now, and in the hospital. 
 Forensics checked her pills. 
 And? Arsenic poisoning. 
 Somebody sprayed them. 
 Shade and Conroy have been missing for more than 24 hours. 
 After 24 hours... 
 We'll find them. Hey, look at this. 
 Upon death, all shares revert back to the company. 
 OK, well, that explains why the dividends went up for Estelle. 
 The money was redistributed to other members, so the more members that die... 
 The more the others' shares go up... 
 Oh, my God. It's a tontine. A French tart? 
 No. But close. 
 Think pie. 
 My dad and I dealt with some fraudsters who had a tontine a couple of years ago. 
 It starts out like a regular investment, with people pooling their money to buy something big. In their case, four pieces to the pie. 
 Now, the investment pays out a dividend each month, but when someone dies, with one less person to pay, everyone else gets a bigger dividend. 
 So instead of passing the shares onto their descendants... 
 Their shares stay with the investment. 
 When Rosemary died, Estelle's and the other women's share increased, but now that Estelle's dead... Alice and Betty's payout will increase. OK, so what happens when you're just left with one? 
 The last person standing gets everything and they get to pass it onto their heirs. 
 Who else knows about this investment? 
 Maybe someone's putting their thumb on the scale. 
 No one, as far as we can tell. 
 Unless... Alice's daughter, Janet. 
 She was pretty quick to leave once we mentioned MOD. 
 And didn't even question why anyone would be after her mother. 
 Plus, I'll bet she's got power of attorney because of her mother's Alzheimer's. 
 Wait a second. 
 That truck they were after... 
 Who is it registered to? 
 Jackson Van Horn. 
 Van Horn... Alice Van Horn. Could that be her son? 
 And Janet's brother. 
 This is the Conroy curse. 
 I'm so sorry for bringing you down with me. 
 Stop talking like that. Nobody's dying in here. 
 I don't know how, but we're getting out of here. 
 (CREAKING SOUND) 
 What was that? 
 Man, we're going down. What? Oh God! 
 I can't swim! I can't swim! Grab onto the roof. 
 There you go. 
 I haven't been in water since cousin Tony drowned in a charity dunk tank on his 39th birthday... 
 You just hold on tight. I'll be right back. 
 What? Where are you going?! 
 The only place I can go: down. What? No, don't go down! 
 Oh God... he went. 
 I said don't go down. 
 What happened? 
 OK, good news. The door is open. 
 The impact broke the lock. 
 All we gotta do is swim down and out. 
 What? I can't. Yeah. Yeah. 
 I can't do that. I won't make it. 
 You can. I'll guide you through it. 
 I can't do it. I can't do it. 
 Conroy, hey, look at me! 
 Conroy... Sushi. 
 The singles mixer. I'm gonna teach you the difference between effect and affect, but we gotta go right now. 
 Will you tell Angie how you really feel? 
 What? Promise me that you will tell Angie how you really feel! 
 Yeah, sure, fine, whatever. We gotta go. You ready? 
 Oh God. One, two, three! 
 (GASPING) 
 Hey! 
 Hello? 
 You there? 
 I did it. 
 Yeah, they're at the bottom of the lake. 
 Hey! 
 Yeah! OK! 
 Get his arm. I'm gonna get his arm. 
 Get something to tie him up. Get something to tie him up? 
 Gimme a signal. Signal. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) Unknown number. Shade? 
 Hey. I'm at... I don't know, a quarry, maybe it's a gravel pit. [We figured it out.] 
 Hang in there, OK? Help's on the way right now. Are you OK? 
 Is Conroy OK? [Yeah, we'll be fine.] 
 Drop the phone! 
 Shade? Shade! 
 How did you manage to screw this up in the three minutes since we've hung up the phone? 
 You know what? You can stay like that. 
 I don't have the energy for you. 
 Come on, move it. 
 Back to the water. 
 (ACCELERATING) 
 The Conroy curse. Pick it up, boys. 
 (POLICE SIRENS) 
 Drop your weapon! Now! 
 Get your hands where we can see 'em! 
 OK, I'm unarmed, I'm unarmed! 
 (COUGHING) 
 (LAUGHING) 
 What took you so long? 
 We made a good team today. We did. 
 You know, I think I'm gonna go back tomorrow and buy that ring. 
 It's time. Can't wait forever, you know what I mean? 
 That's a great idea. 
 Oh, uh, Sergeant Sullivan? Deputy. 
 Deputy, I think I owe you an apology. 
 You were right, and I should have listened. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) Oh, that's Jules. 
 I've been keeping her and your dad updated. 
 She's going to yell at me, and then she's going to cry. 
 So this means my suspension's lifted? 
 Yeah. See you Monday. 
 OK, and maybe a promotion? (SCOFFING) 
 (LAUGHING) I'm pretty sure she'll hug you when you get home. 
 Hey, Jules. 
 Hi, honey. No, I'm fine. 
 Honey, I'm fine. 
 Yeah, honey, I couldn't call you. They took my phone. 
 Honey, calm down. 
 Honey, honey, it's OK. Listen, I'm fine, OK? 
 They didn't do anything to me. I'm fine, OK? 
 I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the tontine earlier. 
 It's just... it's not especially legal. 
 I can sorta see why. 
 How'd you set it up in the first place? 
 The four of us were admin assistants for a group of geologists. 
 None of us were married, and we were determined to secure our future on our own terms. 
 We withdrew our pensions and pooled our money. 
 Did you know there was a mineral deposit on the land? 
 No. 
 It was Alice who noticed the signs. 
 So we rented out the land to a mineral extraction company and that kept us safe for over 40 years. 
 How about now? Alice's two kids are in jail... 
 Well, I have a guest room that barely gets used. 
 Nobody should be without friends or family. 
 Daisies! 
 That's right, Alice. 
 They're your favourite, aren't they? 
 We'll pick some up on our way home. 
 Thank you, Betty. 
 You ladies are lucky to have found one another. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 So nice! It's working again! 
 Thank God! Conroy? What are you doing here? 
 He fixed the air conditioning. 
 Well, you know, couldn't have done it without my two trusted assistants here. 
 Oh? 
 He speaks Spanish. Self-taught. - Con la ayuda de Rosetta Stone. 
 Thanks, Conroy. Don't mention it. 
 Oh, our reservation's in 15 minutes. We should get going. 
 OK. Well, hey, thank you again. 
 You guys go have some fun out there. 
 No, Conroy, you're coming with us. 
 It's your 40th birthday, man. You broke the curse! 
 Oh God, you're right! 
 Wow, OK! Alright, where are we going? 
 Sushi! When I make a promise, I don't forget it. 
 Aw, how cute, you two making plans and promises while stuck in that death trap. 
 Actually, you, uh... you made another promise out there. 
 Oh, that's right. I promised that I would be your wingman at that singles mixer up north! 
 Oh my gosh! I almost forgot about that! 
 That's a good save, buddy. 
 You know what would make this birthday even better than it already is? What's that? 
 Maybe just let me drive the Porsche to the restaurant. 
 (ALL LAUGHING) What? Come on, I almost drowned! 
 Yes, you did. And while that was happening, I remember that you made a promise... 
 Can you drive a stick? I mean, I could learn. 
 What? 
 Don't even bother. I think we're outta here.
