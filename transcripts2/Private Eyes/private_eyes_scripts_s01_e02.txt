 Previously on  Private Eyes ... 
 Any thought about returning to pro hockey, you killed it. 
 Did you ever track down that manager who cleaned you out? 
 I got in! 
 You got in! 
 I'm never gonna be able to pay for all this. 
 I'm Angie Everett, the PI your dad hired. 
 Who's your shadow? 
 Matt Shade. 
 Wow, Matt Shade, that's a PI name if I ever heard one. 
 It is, isn't it? 
 So, same time tomorrow? 
 We're done. 
 Yeah, we're not done. 
 Seriously, what are you gonna do for a job? 
 "Partner"? 
 Associate? 
 No. 
 Colleague? 
 Definitely not. 
 ♪ 
 Ten shirts, five skirts, two blazers, some gym stuff... anything we're missing? Besides a Sherpa. 
 It's so stupid how they make you wear a uniform. 
 Hey, I wore a uniform for ten years in the League. 
 Uniforms are good. Means you're part of something. 
 C'mon, Dad, I wasn't even their first choice. 
 So you classed up the waiting list until they figured out how fabulous you are. 
 No big deal. Ellard's lucky to have you, honey. 
 She's not gonna call. 
 Who? 
 The private detective woman, Angie. You need to call her. 
 Tell her you liked working with her and ask her for a job. 
 Ask her? She should ask me! I basically solved the case. 
 Yeah, you're basically not a PI. 
 Are we done here? Is there somewhere else we have to go? 
 There's one more place. Come on. 
 ♪ 
 It's nice. 
 Dad! 
 Over here. 
 See? Braille tattoos. They implant steel balls under the skin so that they can be read by touch. 
 Aren't they so cool? 
 So cool. 
 And you can get any message you want. 
 I want mine to say "Kick-ass Bitch". 
 How about "Do Not Touch"? 
 We can decide the message later. But what do you think? 
 Have you talked to your mother about this? 
 Yeah right. You wanna give her a nervous breakdown in the middle of her trip? 
 Besides, she's not in charge anymore, you are. 
 Right. 
 Please, please, Dad. 
 I really want this. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Let me think about it, okay? 
 This is Matt Shade. 
 Oh, hey Robyn, long time. 
 Whoa, whoa, slow down. What? 
 (phone ringing) 
 - Mazhari here. 
 Hello, this is your wake-up call, Detective Mazhari. 
 Anything to throw my way? 
 I've tried that before, Angie, but you keep shooting me down. 
 Slow your roll. I'm talking about cases. 
 Hey! 
 Disgruntled husband? Parolee gone rogue? 
 If I had something, you know I would. I'm sorry, Angie. 
 No problem. 
 (girls laughing) 
 Thanks. 
 (car honking) 
 Hey! 
 Dammit! 
 Get in. 
 What? Why would I? 
 Get in! I'll explain on the way. 
 Slow down, Richard Gere. You can't afford me. 
 Angie. 
 Please. Get in. 
 Robyn? 
 In here. 
 I need help.

 Whoa, hey, what are you doing? 
 I'm calling the cops. 
 We don't even know what the situation is. 
 I think I've got the headline. Dead guy. Guilt-stricken hottie. 
 I didn't do this. This is how I found him. 
 You should have no problem explaining that to the police. 
 You don't understand. Zack is my business partner. 
 I was here last night. We had a fight. 
 All things that don't scream "I'm innocent." 
 Robyn's an old friend. Just hear her out. 
 You've got 60 seconds to convince me not to call them. 
 I met Zack six months ago. He's a chef, he owns Pravda. 
 It's the hottest restaurant on Front Street. 
 He was struggling with debts, and he needed help. 
 I fell in love with his brand and I decided to invest. 
 His brand? 
 Bad boy chef. 
 Total rock star. 
 He has a reputation... 
 Had... a reputation for partying and drinking, drugs. 
 He played by his own rules. 
 So what happened last night? 
 I came by to discuss our sales numbers. 
 We ate and had some wine, and Zack told me that he wanted to dissolve our partnership. 
 I freaked out. I told him that I'd spent the last six months and my savings working for this. 
 It didn't matter, he'd made up his mind. 
 So I left. 
 I came back this morning and I found him like this. 
 I swear I didn't do this. 
 You have to believe me. 
 So, what do you think? 
 I think that we might get arrested because this is a murder scene. 
 No, Robyn and I go way back. 
 That doesn't bode well for her judgment. 
 Come on. Isn't that why you got into this? To help people? 
 OK. How's this for help: she should hire a lawyer and turn herself in. 
 Like the police are gonna believe a word that she says! 
 Her fingerprints are all over this place. I'm sure somebody heard them fighting. 
 Just until his lungs were punctured by the stabbing motion of her arm. 
 So where is the knife? 
 Why is there no blood on her? I can't explain these things. I don't care. 
 Fine. You don't wanna take it on, I'll get somebody else. 
 Excellent. See ya. 
 I thought you were made of stronger stuff. 
 Daughter of a cop... 
 I see what you did there. 
 I'll let you get back to the really important work of chasing down fat guys in neck braces. 
 OK. What's your connection to her? 
 Her husband Russ and I used to play hockey together back in the day. 
 Let me guess. He hit the big time and dumped his wife? 
 He died. 
 About a year ago. 
 Robyn's just getting her life back together. 
 Angie, if we don't help her, she's got nobody. 
 Get her out of here. I'll wait for the cops. 
 You won't regret it. 
 I already do. 
 I'm sorry I got you into this, Shade. 
 Don't worry, we'll figure this out. Angie's the best. 
 When did you get into the PI business? 
 Uh, it's still kinda new. 
 (siren) 
 (door opening) 
 Oh, you gotta be kidding me. 
 Detective Nolan. 
 Alright, let's have it. 
 I was doing some work for him. I came to check in, found him on the floor, called you guys. What kind of work? 
 Grab a subpoena, I'd be happy to tell you. 
 I'm serious, Ang. 
 See anybody leaving? Any sign of the murder weapon? Anything at all that could help us? 
 I got you here, didn't I? 
 Hold on. 
 I don't know what you're up to, but if I find out you're holding out on me? 
 I'm not gonna be so accommodating this time around. You stay out of this. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna need a Forensics team out here right away. 
 So how'd it go? 
 Just get us out of here. 
 Oh my god. 
 I totally forgot. 
 What? You killed someone else? 
 My car! 
 I was drinking last night, and Zack took my keys. 
 Better and better. 
 Hey Tony, it's Shade. 
 No, there's nothing wrong with the Porsche. 
 Look, I need a favour. Fast. 
 Sir. We found these. 
 They don't match any of the victim's cars. 
 (car chirping) 
 (car chirping) 
 Hey! 
 Hey, wait! Stop! Stop! 
 Thanks, Tony. I owe you one. 
 No, really, the Porsche is fine. 
 Tow truck on speed dial, huh? 
 This car is a classic. Over thirty years old and still purrs like a kitten. You oughta know something about that. 
 Can we go? 
 You'll be safe here until we figure out what's going on. 
 Shade, I can't do this to you. What about Jules and Don? 
 Don knows. And I told Jules your place is being painted. 
 Let's talk about Zack. What can you tell us? 
 Did he have any enemies? 
 Where do I start? 
 Zack was rough on everybody. 
 Vendors, staff, customers. 
 Can we narrow that down? 
 One of Zack's employees shot a video last month and posted it on the internet. 
 How many times do I have to say it? Sauce goes on the side! Do you understand anything that I tell you? 
 OK. 
 Who's that guy? 
 Miguel Quintana, the sous-chef. But that's not who I'm thinking of. 
 Zack! You son of a bitch!  (Zack laughing) Helen Jeong. 
 Oh, you think that's funny? 
 She owns Bechamel. 
 What's Bechamel? 
 Seriously? 
 Do you ever go out? 
 It's a French bistro down the street from Zack's place. 
 Best lobster bisque in the city. 
 I'm betting Helen was pretty upset when Zack moved into the area and started stealing her customers. 
 Zack didn't help matters. 
 He dumped garbage on her patio, he smeared kitchen grease all over her doors. 
 That's disgusting. 
 Are you kidding? To a chef, that's like foreplay. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll look into things and get back to you. 
 Wait, I thought... 
 What? 
 I thought we could work it together like we did last time. 
 Together. You and me. 
 Yeah, why not? 
 So, so many reasons, but I'll choose one: you're not a PI. 
 What do you know about the restaurant industry? 
 I know enough. 
 Really. What's the hierarchy of the kitchen? 
 Who runs front of house? What day is the fish market open? 
 Alright. 200 bucks. 
 You want me to pay you to let me tag along? 
 Take it or leave it. 
 Fine. 
 All I got is $160. 
 Close enough. 
 I get that back if I help you solve the case. 
 I'm not worried. 
 Alright, that right over there, that's Zack's place, Pravda. Ultra-hip, cutting-edge fusion with a Russian flair. And that is Bechamel. 
 Classic French, four Avignon Stars. 
 And a chef with a knife fetish. I say we start there. 
 Alright. 
 Tomorrow's no good. We need that delivery by 5PM. 
 Helen Jeong? Angie Everett, Everett Investigations. 
 Matt Shade, likewise. 
 Wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Zack Beach. 
 What's he done now? Accused me of putting goldfish in my bouillabaisse? 
 He's dead. 
 Helen... 
 Um, get me some water. 
 How did it happen? 
 He was stabbed in his apartment. 
 How awful. 
 It must have been hard on your business, operating across from one of the hottest restaurants in town. 
 At first. 
 But we got by. Besides, he manages his bookings so poorly we get walk-ins who are tired of waiting. 
 What about the garbage? The kitchen grease? 
 That's just Zack being Zack. 
 And the incident in his kitchen? 
 You remember: You wielding a knife, looking like you wanted to kill him. 
 Shade! 
 Tell them. Tell them what he did. 
 Zack stole Helen's signature dish, a traditional cassoulet. 
 Flash froze it, then deep fried it in tempura and jammed it on a skewer. 
 Sounds delicious. 
 It was disgusting. 
 How would you feel if somebody made a mockery of your life's work? 
 Read my Twitter feed. Difference is I don't go after people with kitchen knives. 
 I lost my temper! 
 But I never would've actually done anything. 
 Then where you were last night? 
 Shade! 
 Meeting with my financial advisor, not that it's any of your business. Now why don't you just sleuth your way out of here? 
 Let's go. 
 What the hell was that? 
 What? You were dancing around the question. 
 'Cause that's the point! Build their trust so you can catch them in a lie later. 
 Excuse me. Sorry about that. 
 Helen can be a bit high-strung sometimes. 
 She might have had a reason to be. 
 But she didn't do it. 
 So who did? 
 I don't know, but you should talk to Zack's staff. 
 We heard he was tough on them. 
 It's not just that. 
 Zack was a bit of a player. 
 He'd hook up with a new waitress every weekend, and then dump her by Monday. 
 If she didn't like it, he'd fire her. Guy like that, I'm guessing he made some enemies. 
 Worth checking out. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Wow! If you wanna search me, I'll give you directions. 
 Look. 
 Who's that? 
 Detective Derek Nolan. 
 He already warned me about interfering in the case. 
 So what are we gonna do? 
 You need to take me to dinner. 
 Angie? 
 Down in a sec. 
 We're all set for tonight. 
 The restaurant's doing a special invite-only seating in honor of Zack's memory, but I pulled a few strings. 
 By "pulled a few strings", you mean "talked to Robyn"? 
 That's a string! 
 Did you check Helen's alibi? 
 I contacted her financial advisor. 
 She confirmed that Helen was there until after midnight. After that, she took a cab straight home. I just got off the phone with the cab company. 
 What? 
 Wow. 
 What have you done with Angie? 
 Eyes up here. You're drooling on my floor. 
 And just like that, she's back. 
 After you. 
 (whistling) What did I say? 
 Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 Look at this place. All these people are here for overpriced food? 
 And to honor the passing of a legend. 
 Oh, give me a break. 
 You shove it in one end, it comes out of the other. 
 You haven't even tasted his cooking! 
 I'd take a burger and fries over this any day. 
 And what about trying something new? 
 Variety is the spice of life. 
 Ketchup is the spice of life. 
 No, it isn't. 
 OK, I'll be right back. 
 No, I can't just sit at an empty table. We have to order something. Sit down. 
 What's the matter? No tuna melt? 
 "Rambutan iberico with hyssop and demerara." Is this even English? 
 Allow me. 
 Hi. We'll start with the black truffle emulsion, then you can bring us two orders of the otoro with cedar smoke, and bring us your best bottle of falanghina. 
 Thank you. 
 I used to eat out a lot when I was a player. 
 You gonna stick with that story? 
 I know about the restaurant you used to own. 
 Your ex-manager got you into it. 
 You lost half a million bucks and gained forty pounds. 
 At least that's what it looked like in the pictures. 
 (forced laughter) You backgrounded me. 
 I'm a PI, that's what I do. 
 Which means you're considering me as a partner. 
 No. No, I was just... 
 Curious? 
 Stay here. 
 It's not gonna work. 
 What isn't? 
 Your plan to go undercover as a waitress. You're wearing the exact same dress as all the other waitresses. Except... they're all blonde one of Zack's quirks so I'm gonna assume you brought a wig, which is why you're carrying that large handbag instead of a clutch. 
 How am I doing? 
 Why isn't it gonna work? 
 Restaurants are tight. The staff will pick you out in a heartbeat. 
 They hired new people for tonight, and I don't have to convince the whole staff, just Lindsay. 
 Who's Lindsay? 
 Lindsay is the waitress who posted the video of Zack and Helen. I did some digging. 
 Have you ever waited tables before? It's a lot harder than you think. 
 I don't have to pass an employee evaluation, Shade, I just have to fake it until I get some info. 
 I can help you get information. 
 I don't need your help. 
 What I need is for you to sit here for 15 minutes and not screw everything up. 
 Think you can handle that? Good. 
 Hi. Lindsay? 
 Lindsay? 
 I'm Lindsay. Who're you? 
 I'm Mimi. 
 I just got hired for tonight. The hostess said you could show me around. 
 Whatever. Just don't slow me down. 
 Tips are gonna be epic. 
 Hey. You worked here long? I'm only asking because... 
 I've got a boyfriend. 
 Right. 
 Oh my God. Matt Shade. What a coincidence. 
 Do I know you? 
 I'm Detective Derek Nolan. 
 I'm a big fan. I've seen everything you've done. Everything. 
 I was just watching you today! 
 Oh yeah, where was that? 
 Yeah, you were in this street cam footage and you were driving away from my crime scene this morning. Yeah. 
 Nice Porsche. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 Ten's up! 
 That's unbelievable. 
 So what did Zack say? 
 Zack told Trina he wanted to go away with her, but then he changed his mind and ended up taking off with a stripper he met on Gerrard. 
 What an ass! 
 I can't believe he's gone. 
 You don't think someone here... ? 
 Killed him? No. Zack was a total jerk, but we knew that going in. 
 And besides, his attitude was a lot better lately. 
 What do you mean? 
 Last few months, a red pickup would pull up an hour before dinner service. We called it the "Ninja-mobile" because it had a white throwing star on the door. Zack would jump in, drive off, and be back before dinner with a lot more focus, if you know what I mean. 
 Hey, twelve's up. Let's go. 
 That's me. 
 Grab those and stay close. 
 (whimpering) 
 So where's Everett? She here with you? 
 She wishes. 
 You two make a great team. That was cute, that little stunt you pulled with the tow truck. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Come on, you didn't think I was gonna track the car down? I ran the VIN. It's registered to a Robyn Westing. 
 Never heard of her. 
 Really? 'Cause according to her cell phone records, she called you this morning. And now here you are in the restaurant she co-owns. 
 Hey. Over here. 
 Oof. You mind if I... move over here? I've got this old hockey injury. I can't stay in one position too long. It's like a sciatic... 
 Hey! 
 Oh, Detective, you know, I... I do remember that phone call. Robyn called me this morning and invited me to come here. 
 To the Zack Beach memorial dinner. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Except he wasn't reported dead until after that. 
 Lady, I didn't order this. 
 I'm allergic to shellfish. I will literally die. 
 Uh, Detective Nolan, we are in a bar. 
 Maybe I can buy you a drink? 
 Look, Shade, I don't know what your game is, but you do not want to make an enemy out of me, OK? 
 Stay out of my way, and that goes for Everett too. 
 Oh, just a word of advice. 
 There are some things about Angie that you don't know. 
 So if I were you, I'd find another hobby. 
 Just that. 
 
 
 
 That was close. 
 I don't know what I was worried about. 
 You're a natural. 
 **** your IQ legibly dropped 50 points. But the best the best one of the night-was you getting reamed out by that customer you tried to kill. 
 I didn't try to kill him... 
 Ha, ha, ha! 
 Oh, I don't know, in a court of law, death by lobster may carry the jury. 
 All that matters is that Nolan didn't see me. 
 Yeah, thanks to me. 
 I had to do some serious stick-handling in there. 
 Guy probably thinks I'm nuts. 
 He's got good instincts. 
 What's the deal with you two, anyway? 
 The deal? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, I can understand people finding you irritating, but his irritation has a certain depth. 
 He's just one of those cops that hates PIs. 
 No, no, no. 
 It seemed more personal than that. 
 No. No accounting for taste. Anyway, tonight wasn't a complete loss. 
 Lindsay turned out to be quite useful. 
 Oh yeah? Did she give you a list of Zack's former lovers? 
 Even better. 
 I found out he had a major drug problem. 
 According to Lindsay, he'd drive off in a red pickup with a throwing star logo on it a few times a week. 
 Huh. 
 Maintaining a habit like that requires more than chump change. You think he got in too deep? 
 Makes sense. 
 How do we find this guy? 
 I'll call Maz. 
 Get him to cross reference the vehicle registration database with companies that have a throwing star logo. Maybe we'll get lucky. 
 Wait. What are we gonna tell Robyn? About tonight? 
 About Nolan being there? We're gonna tell her the truth. 
 She's going to be upset. 
 Better that she hears it from us. 
 (sighing) I want to protect her. She doesn't deserve any of this. 
 You're not protecting her by keeping her in the dark. 
 If I was getting in the way of this investigation, you'd tell me, right? 
 Are you fishing for a compliment? 
 I'm serious. 
 We need to do what's best for Robyn. 
 Let's go. 
 It's freezing out here. 
 (door opening) 
 Ah, good, you're back. 
 We're running out of Scotch. 
 Dad, this is Angie. 
 Nice to meet you in person. I helped your dad with a few wiretaps back in the day. 
 You're the phone company guy. 
 Yeah, that's right, 30 years. 
 Now I consult, bill 'em double. 
 Dad liked you. 
 Yeah, I liked him too. He was a good man. 
 I'm sorry he's gone. 
 Please tell me that you found something. 
 Maybe. But Detective Nolan showed up. 
 He tracked down your car. 
 Oh my God. 
 This can't be happening. 
 I'll go. 
 I'm going to jail, aren't I? 
 Not if we can help it. 
 Shade's confidence is rubbing off on you. 
 After Russ died, it was like... the air went out of me. 
 It would have taken a natural disaster to get me out of bed, let alone out the front door. 
 Let me guess: Shade provided the natural disaster. 
 He hired twenty Irish stepdancers to jig and reel on my front porch until I opened the door. 
 He turned my anger into a block party. 
 Subtlety isn't his strong suit. 
 Yeah. 
 Shade's a wildcard. 
 But there is no one else I'd turn to in a jam. 
 Best restaurant in town, we didn't even eat. 
 So, Jules wants a tattoo, huh? 
 I take it you have an opinion on this. 
 Sure. It's a great idea. 
 Maybe she could start dating a biker while she's at it. 
 Come on, Dad, give her some credit. 
 She's more mature than you think. 
 Smarter too. 
 She waited to ask until her mother left town. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Face it, son. You're a soft target. 
 Oh, don't get all bent out of shape. 
 It's the truth and you know it. You're just used to being "weekend Dad", you're not used to making these tough calls. 
 You're making this decision easier by the second. 
 She's your daughter, you do what you think is right. 
 But did you ever stop to ask her why? 
 That was Mazhari. 
 He found a match in the vehicle registration database. 
 Doug Boonstra, owner of CentreStrike Enterprises, and a red pickup. 
 Spent five years inside for drug and assault. 
 Zack's dealer. 
 Looks like he collected on his debt. 
 This is the most uncomfortable car I've ever sat in. 
 It's a rental. 
 You're giving me a hard time about my car and you can't even commit to one? 
 It's not about commitment, it's about being anonymous, which is what we're trying to do right now. 
 Well, can we at least turn the rental car on? 
 I'm freezing. 
 I told you to bring a sleeping bag. 
 No, you didn't. 
 Oops. 
 We don't even know if this Boonstra guy is going to show. 
 That's right. We just have to wait. 
 It's all part of being a PI. 
 Hey, have you got anything to eat? 
 I'm starving. 
 You're a bundle of needs, aren't you? 
 Glove compartment. 
 Animal crackers? 
 It's a habit I picked up from my dad. 
 He was diabetic, he had to eat every few hours in order to keep his blood sugar up. 
 We used to sit on stakeout together and eat a whole bag of these. 
 You know what? Next time, I'll bring the crackers. 
 Next time? 
 Hm. 
 Are you seriously angling for a job using my dad's memory? 
 No. 
 I was just being friendly. 
 Do you even know why you want to be a PI? 
 It's becoming less and less clear to me. 
 You haven't even thought it through that far, have you? 
 No, I haven't. 
 Because I don't spend my life thinking about every little detail. 
 I trust my gut. I improvise. 
 I hate to break it to you, but in this business, it's all about the details. 
 Improvising doesn't work. 
 Shut up. 
 Yeah, truth hurts, huh? 
 No, shut up and look. 
 Oh. 
 Let's go. But this time, we stick to a plan. Follow my lead. 
 Right. 
 You got a plan to get out of that sleeping bag? 
 Interesting taste in art. 
 (thuds) 
 Standing by to follow your lead, boss. 
 Let's come back later. 
 OK. 
 (growling) 
 (barking) 
 Oh boy. 
 Good boy. Nice doggy. 
 Hey! 
 Now we improvise. Is this the Bright Sky Travel Agency? 
 We're investigating the death of Zack Beach. 
 What was your relationship to him? 
 (sighing) I guess there's no harm in telling you now. I was his sponsor. 
 I thought Zack was still using. 
 So did everybody. 
 That's the way he wanted it. 
 I didn't approve, but he said it was important to maintain his "brand". 
 The hard-drinking, party-all-night chef. 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 But in reality, man, he'd given it all up: the drinking, the drugs, even smoking. 
 So you'd show up at the restaurant, and bring him here. 
 Zack needed an outlet for all that stress. He'd throw some blades, blow off steam. 
 Do you have any idea why he suddenly decided to go clean? 
 It's always a bunch of things, isn't it? 
 But I figure the big one was the fire. 
 What fire? 
 Yeah, a little over six months ago, Zack was drunk at the restaurant. 
 One of the stations in his kitchen caught fire and nearly burned the place down. 
 I'm pretty sure that was rock bottom. 
 You get the impression we're being misled? 
 You mean by Robyn? 
 She said she met Zack six months ago. Smart girl like her, she would have done her due diligence. Which means... 
 She knew about the fire. 
 Ta-da. 
 No. 
 No way. Robyn wouldn't lie to me. 
 You sure about that? 
 We've been friends for 15 years! 
 She's always been straight with me, even when I didn't want to hear it. 
 Look, when Becca and I were still fighting over custody of Jules, I asked her what she thought I should do. 
 She could have just said, "Hey, Jules is your kid too, you deserve 50-50." That's what everybody else was saying. 
 But she didn't. 
 She sat me down, and she said "The way you are right now, Jules is better off with her mother." 
 You're still thinking of her as a friend. 
 But she's not a friend right now, she's our client. 
 Clients lie. 
 Part of this job is learning to spot the tells. 
 The other part is figuring out what to do once you've found them. 
 You need to decide who you're going to be loyal to: your friends, or the truth. 
 Why didn't you tell me about the fire? 
 You lied to me. 
 How did you find out? 
 Does it matter? 
 Zack came to me after it happened, told me he wanted to get clean. 
 But I'd just poured all my savings into the restaurant. Everything that Russ left me. 
 And you were afraid if Zack suddenly changed, you'd lose it all. No more "bad boy" chef. 
 We were barely breaking even as it was. 
 And people expected "the Zack show" when they came for dinner. So... 
 I asked him to pretend that he was still using. 
 You're talking about that video. 
 It was fake. 
 He was keeping up the facade. He had been for the past six months. 
 (police siren) 
 Robyn, go inside. 
 Hold it right there, Ms. Westing. 
 You're under arrest for the murder of Zack Beach. 
 She didn't do it. 
 Found a knife in her apartment that matches the profile of the victim's wound. 
 There must be a million knives that match that profile. 
 Maybe. But when you consider her fingerprints were all over the scene, people heard them fighting, and Zack had just cleared out her life savings, well, that number becomes a little less relevant, don't you think? Come on, let's go. 
 Shade? 
 Hey. 
 How about you go back to cross-checking or whatever it is you're good at, OK? 
 This isn't for you. 
 ♪ 
 Hey, Wilson, it's Angie. I was just calling to see if you needed any follow-up on that workman's comp case. Let me know. 
 Hey. 
 Nolan came by my house. He's got Robyn. 
 OK. 
 OK? 
 She's been charged with murder. We need a plan. 
 A plan to what? Break her out of jail? 
 To find out who the real killer is! 
 Shade... 
 So get your coat and help me figure this out. 
 Robyn lied to us about Zack. 
 So? She was scared. 
 She'd just invested everything she had in the Zack Beach brand, and all of a sudden he wanted to blow it all up. 
 She was afraid if she told us, she'd look guilty. 
 She was right. But at least she would've been honest. 
 You think she really did this. 
 He stole her money. Took away her hopes and dreams, her one chance to build a new life after her husband died. What do  yo  think that did to her? 
 Hey, I've been ripped off too, and God knows I'd love to stick a knife in my ex-manager. 
 But Robyn's different. She'd never do that. 
 You're too caught up in this. 
 You're giving up on me? 
 I think this is yours. 
 Detective Everett, Homicide. I need to check something. 
 I didn't know you were coming. 
 That's typical. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Everett. What's up? 
 You stole my father's police badge. 
 What? Me? No! 
 How dare you? 
 I'm just at the grocery store, picking up a few items. Hey, are these kumquats fresh? 
 Shade, I'm outside. I can see your Porsche down the block. 
 You need to get out of there right now. 
 Not until I find something that'll help Robyn. 
 Do you have any idea how much trouble you'll be in if you get caught? 
 Not as much trouble as she's in right now. 
 Wait. 
 Oh, crap. 
 Shade? 
 Shade... 
 Shade! Can you hear me? Get out of there! 
 Shade! 
 (honking) 
 Relax. I found something. 
 Get out now. Nolan's here. 
 What? 
 Whoever you are, I know you're in here. 
 What do I do? 
 Find another exit. 
 There isn't one. 
 Come on out and I'll go easy on you. 
 Meet me out front. 
 What? 
 Just do it! 
 Come on... 
 Come on, where are you? 
 Whoa! 
 Are you nuts? My car! 
 It's a rental. 
 Get in. 
 Hurry up! 
 (groaning) 
 What's that? 
 Zack Beach was opening a new restaurant. 
 What are you doing here? You know I've already been cleared by the police. 
 Zack Beach was opening a new restaurant, and you were his partner. 
 Keep your voice down. 
 We found the construction plans; your name was all over them. A French bistro in Prince Edward County. 
 Zack came to me shortly after the knife incident. 
 He said he was clean and sober, and wanted to start fresh somewhere new, close Pravda. We made a deal to work together. 
 I thought you hated him. 
 He drove me crazy, but I didn't hate him. 
 Having him in the neighbourhood made me better. 
 So what about this place? 
 I've already made arrangements to sell it. 
 I was meeting with my financial advisor to finalize the details the night Zack was killed. 
 Avignon Stars. 
 Béchamel is the only restaurant in the city to earn a four-star rating. 
 Like that photo you took at Zack's place. 
 Who else can wear these? 
 Just Taylor and I. 
 (Shade): Did she know you were selling this place? 
 I haven't told her yet. Why? 
 Any chance she could have found out on her own? 
 Taylor, how long have you worked here? 
 Ten years? 
 Twelve. 
 That's loyalty. 
 You must have been really upset when you found out Helen was selling the restaurant. 
 We found this in Zack's apartment. 
 It's an Avignon Star. Just like the one that you're missing from your lapel. 
 Why? Why were you giving up like that? 
 I wasn't... 
 After all the years we've spent building up this place! 
 And you were gonna let it all go because of that monster! 
 I killed for you! 
 Taylor, don't do anything stupid! 
 Helen, go! 
 Wow. So we're hitting girls now, huh? 
 She had a knife! 
 No, but you really hit her. 
 Like, you hit her hard. She's probably got a concussion. 
 Like, you would have sent that girl to the hospital. 
 That probably wasn't necessary, was it? 
 ♪ 
 (Shade whistles.) 
 What is it with you two showing up at my crime scenes? 
 You can thank us later. I take cash or cheque. 
 How about silver? 
 Are you serious? 
 What are you doing? 
 I am arresting your partner here for obstruction of justice and impersonating a police officer. 
 How have you been getting away with it for so long? 
 Give me a break, Nolan. We just solved your case. 
 I don't make the rules; I just follow them, which is more than I can say for you two. 
 Is this how it's gonna be now? I can't make a move without you breathing down my neck? 
 I don't know. You tell me. 
 So that is the new guy? 
 That's your dad's replacement? 
 Wow. You used to know where the line was, Everett; now I'm starting to wonder. 
 What if he is the new guy? 
 Then I guess we'll be seeing a lot more of each other. 
 (police siren blaring) 
 (knocking on door) 
 Angie, good to see you. 
 Hm! 
 Carol and I are gonna stop inviting you to dinner unless we get a yes soon. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 I appreciate you checking in on me. 
 How are you holding up? Must be hard being on your own. 
 That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about. 
 Ah. Is this about Mr. Shade by chance? 
 He had quite the adventure over the last 72 hours. 
 Yes, but he was also responsible for catching a murderer the police weren't even looking at and saving an innocent woman from going to jail. 
 I don't know if that justifies what he did. 
 "Hiring a tow truck to remove evidence, concealing a suspect in his house, impersonating a police officer." 
 Does it help that he wasn't very good at it? 
 He also hit on a booking clerk. 
 Look, I know Shade's a bit of a loose cannon and incredibly annoying and bull-headed, but sometimes, that's useful and, truthfully, he's got really good instincts, and he never gives up. Even when he should. 
 Sounds like you're trying to talk yourself into something. 
 I just hope you know what you're doing. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 You look amazing, honey, and you're gonna knock 'em dead. 
 Yeah, you have to say that. 
 It's true! 
 Bye. 
 (bell tolling) 
 Jules... 
 Uh-oh! I know that voice. 
 Is this about my tattoo? 
 Look, you know I wanna back you as much as I can, it's just... 
 That's a really big decision, and you're only 14 years old. I'm just not sure that... 
 Hey, Dad? OK, look, I love the fact that you went to the trouble of writing a speech, but I'm getting old over here. 
 OK. Tell me why. 
 And the real reason, not just 'cause it's cool. 
 I need to be able to walk into that school with something that... that shows people who I am. 
 You know. Otherwise, I'm just "that kid from the wait list." 
 And you think a tattoo's gonna change that? 
 Well, it can't hurt. 
 Jules... people are gonna treat you the way they're gonna treat you, and the best way to show people who you are is by being yourself. 
 You're right. 
 Sorry, one of my concussions must be recurring. I could have sworn I heard you agree with me. 
 They're cool and all, but I've got better things to do with my body. 
 See you, Dad. 
 (laughing): OK. 
 Wait, what better things?

 Yeah, I heard. 
 Right, of course. You guys are friends. Uh... 
 Something else? 
 ♪ People come and go ♪ 
 Six months ago, I went after a witness a little too hard. Nolan charged me with criminal harassment. 
 That's what's between us. 
 Wow! 
 OK. 
 Yeah. 
 Is there a reason you're telling me this? 
 I don't like keeping secrets from people I'm working with. 
 Working with? 
 You're reckless, impulsive, and - most frighteningly - have no grasp of how much you don't know yet. 
 It means the world you're telling me this in person. 
 But I also think, judging from the last week or so, that there's a chance we might work well together. 
 Are... are you offering me a job? 
 My dad always used to say, "Move forward or die," and while the latter seems wildly preferable right now, yes...
