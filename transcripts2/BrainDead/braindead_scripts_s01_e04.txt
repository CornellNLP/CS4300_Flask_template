 Yeah, I just moved in.

 Uh, Jules. 
 Well, if you need anything, just...

 (gasps) 
 What we need is another American revolution, but against the people who are thwarting the dreams of the American people, who are doing everything they can to put America last. 
 Monarch :  And so the Republicans have basically put a bullet in the head of the U.S. economy. 
 By refusing to negotiate, refusing to even talk, they... Misty :  Who else but the Democrats have given health care to the unproductive takers in our society at the expense of the hardworking, average American middle class and job creators in our econ... Monarch :  ...losses so far. They shaved point-six percent off economic growth this quarter alone, and the yield on short-term treasury bonds has risen, causing global investors to be extremely unhappy. (dog barking in distance) Man (over radio) :  On today's program, health care and lollipops. We all remember that moment... Man 2 (over other radio) :  Liberals hate America! They side with our enemies! They're more concerned with banning soda pop... Man :  The fall from the monkey bars... Could you please turn that down? (both radio programs continue) (turns up volume) Man 2 :  Feminista! Barack Obama! He's their guy! (engine revving loudly) (tires screech) (man 2 continues shouting) Man :  And should that even be a question? We're going to hear from Lucy... Man 2 :  ...are people not seeing this?! (loud crash) (clattering) Rocky. Laurel : Well, that's not bad. You look like a Rocky. Nope. Rocky from  Rocky and Bullwinkle. (laughing) Yeah. Till I was 17, I had a high-pitched voice. (high-pitched): Hey, Bullwinkle! (both laugh) All right, what was your nickname? Mine? Yeah. Oh, no, I wasn't popular enough to have a nickname. See, that can't be true. Come on. No, I'm serious. People thought I was a good girl, so they called me... "good girl." Yeah, it wasn't a very creative school; even the bullying was prosaic. (laughs) So, um... I need to ask you a work question. Can you put your FBI hat on? Sure. Hold on. Okay, go. My brother says that a terrorist group is responsible for these, um... head eruptions. Uh, CHIs. CHIs. Right. Is that true? The Islamic Rayid Front claims responsibility, but they take responsibility for everything. Actually, we think it's medical. We've just been given 2-64 powers. What's that? U.S. Code 2-64. We can help the CDC investigate by taking people into custody for observation. Have you heard of the screwworm? No. What's that? It's this bug from Central America. It burrows into the skull and... Makes heads explode? I know. Look it up on Wikipedia. It's kind of terrifying. And... What's wrong? Nothing. Just somebody I know from work. Who, the Healy girl? Gareth : Yeah. You know her? Misty : No. I know the Healys. Are you slumming with a Democratic icon, Gareth? (chuckles) (chuckles): Oh, that's so cute. It's that newscaster, isn't it? Misty... something? Yeah. She's awful. Who's that guy she's with? He looks familiar. I don't know. Probably some lobbyist. The Healys are always jumping into bed with somebody. So who's that? Old boyfriend? No. Just this Republican I'm working with. (snaps fingers) I know him. Great! You want to go sit at his table? (chuckles) So, Misty... have you heard about this new group, the One Wayers? Grassroots. Shrink the government. No new taxes. We've received 83 calls in the last week. This isn't some ploy? Get us to report on something you guys are just astroturfing? Would I do that to you? (chuckles) Look, all 83 calls said the same thing: stay the course on the government shutdown. Who leads it? We don't know. I thought I'd get a reporter to look into it. You let me know if you see one around. (laughs) What do you want? Martini? Yeah. Surprise me. So, this was subtle. Bringing your date to the same bar we were at the other night. I'm sorry, were you talking to me? Look, that guy you're with, he's an FBI agent, and you need to watch out for him. (laughs quietly) What? I'm just saying, he's not a good guy. You don't have to listen to me. An Old Fashioned and a light beer, please. Old Fashioned and a martini. People at the FBI used to call him a "ten center." You know why? Just standing here waiting for my drinks. It's like that old joke. There's this elderly couple, and they find themselves destitute. And the wife says, "Don't vorry, I vill go out and sell my body." Are they Eastern European? So, she's gone all day, and when she comes back, she says, "Ve are saved. I have made 250 dollars and ten cents." And the husband says, "Ten cents? Who gave you ten cents?" She says, "Everybody." So my date is like an Eastern European woman who sleeps around? No. Your date is like a mercenary who sells himself to the lowest bidder. (sets drink down) Okay, I'm going now. What was that all about? Nothing. He says he knows you. Anthony : Really? Oh, dear Lord. This night is like a circus. (exhales) One second. Just... Gustav, I'm having a drink. I've got some bugs. Okay, can we talk about it another time? And how did you even know I was here? I was looking for bugs in my apartment, and then I saw Zeke, and he was... Who's Zeke? No, don't answer that. (meows) Okay, Gustav. Tomorrow. Your date's leaving anyway... work needs him. What? Laurel, hey, uh, I just got a text. I got to go. Works needs me. I'm Anthony. I know. Okay, uh... I'll call you later. All right? Okay. (phone chimes) Okay. Okay, thanks. Laurel had fun. Okay. Uh... I'll call you. Did you text him? No. How would I know how to do that? I just saw he was getting a text. That's all. Gustav... Look, this is more important. We have to get Zeke to your doctor friend for a CAT scan. Rochelle : Yep, cat CAT scan. I'm so glad I went to med school. The pyriform's intact. Everything's healthy. See? Try the posterior lateral sulcus. Try farther up. Rochelle : Hmm. There we go. Your cat moved. He didn't move. What? What is it? There is no lateral sulcus. That's not possible. Try the suprasplenial gyrus. It's the screwworms. They can't do that. Clearly they did. How else can you explain... It's missing, too? Cat moved, or the CT... I don't know. The bugs ate half its brain. That's why people are changing. They only have half their brains. Can you even live with half a brain? (Zeke meows) Laurel : You don't see them, do you? Rochelle : No. The eardrum's punctured though. Gustav : That's how they get in. The bugs push in through the eardrum. Is that true? I don't know. All I'm saying is this cat has a punctured eardrum. That means they're deaf in one ear. That's how we know who's infected. We don't know anything yet. Uh, perilymph fluid is missing. What does that mean? Inner ear. A loss of fluid means... Balance. Absence of perilymph fluid means that they're off balance. That's how we know who's infected. If they're deaf in one ear or off balance, they're probably missing half their brain. Ah. Here's Senator Pollack now. I asked her to join us, too. Mr. Tabak, Ella Pollack. I just lost $4 million. You just lost...? Eh, uh... I just lost $4 million more. Uh, sir, uh, we're in a complicated situation. We're the party of adults. (scoffs) It's the Republicans who shut down the government... I don't care. Now, I've personally bundled half a billion dollars for your party. Unless this is solved, that money goes away. The Republicans are asking us to cut three major agencies... Yes, and you will slash one as a show of good faith. No, we won't. Yes, you will. Now, I'm meeting with the Republicans in an hour, and I need a compromise. You have 40 seconds to name the agency... You can take your money and shove it. Ella, let's-let's all just... No. I'm sick of playing dead for big money. See what you think about a 20% jump in capital gains tax, you jackass. Who is this woman? I'm the homeless person knocking at your tinted window. I'm your daughter when she sleeps with the poli-sci professor. 40 seconds, Luke. National Endowment for the Arts. Good. We'll wrap this up tomorrow. (choir singing in foreign language) (choir continues) Laurel (over video) :  This music is disappearing, just as the island itself is disappearing. All I need are matching funds. What are you doing? I'm cold. Laurel :  I need $200,000 to further this effort. Please give generously. I'm coming. (video stops) I'm hearing about these One Wayers, Senator. What are they? Well, Misty, just in the last week, we've received literally hundreds of e-mails and calls from this group... people who feel like they're losing their country, who feel America is going to hell, and, well, they're out to make it great again. These brave citizens want to lift America out of its downward spiral towards weakness... Woman (over TV) :  As if the presidential campaign weren't hot enough, the nation... Hello. I'm Laurel. I'm an aide to the senator specializing in constituent casework. You are... Noah Feffer? Yes. Hello. That's a nasty cut you've got there. I was in a car crash. I'm sorry. Are you all right? Yes. Would you like to sit? No. Would you like any water? No. Okay. How may I help you? I'm angry. Regarding? Everything. The thing is, the more specific you get... Income inequality, childhood diseases, big oil, your brother cutting the National Endowment of the Arts. Why is he doing that? Well, I think it's more about reopening the government... Oh, no, no. (door closes) It is about giving in to the fascists. Now, he needs to take the fight to the Republicans. When they kill a hostage, he needs to kill a hostage. When they hold a knife to his throat, he needs to hold a knife to theirs. Look at Finland and Denmark... why can't we be more like them? Okay. I will tell Senator Healy. Thank you. Why aren't you angry? Why aren't I? I'm the constituent caseworker here... Our country is in mortal danger. Why can't you see that? We need a political revolution! You-you just sit there, but the One Wayers, they count on us being peaceful and calm. What... You haven't heard a word I said. I have. Every word. Even if I don't sound angry... Don't patronize me! Now, they are armed, because they have the NRA, so we need to arm ourselves. Okay. Thank you, sir. I'm needed in another meeting. Oh, that's all you have to say? This isn't over. Actually it is. Good-bye. ♪ ♪ He said what? He said, "There are other ways to arm ourselves." Get the capitol police on it. I'm fine. No, he threatened you, Laurel. Did you call the capitol police? Yes. But they're a little busy. Then talk to the FBI, and if they don't get right over here, get me on the phone with them. Luke, stop worrying, okay? And do you really want me at this thing? I want you to talk to his chief of staff, see where we're headed. We need to get the government back to work. Uh, Mr. Tabak, good morning. (groans softly) Red : Ha-ha! Here we all are! Shall we settle this today? I think we shall. Red : ...already discussed this! Ella : No, we haven't discussed it! (arguing continues behind door) (sighs): Well... this is going well. Hey, look, your girlfriend's on TV. She's not my... She looks pouty today. You upset her, Gar? So how long have you known your FBI friend? What happened to her usual bedroom eyes? She looks like she's gonna cry. Yeah. It's probably because the Democrats are bankrupting our nation. (laughs quietly) Red : Look, you already agreed to cut one department. Just cut the other two! See? This is what we're up against. And we shouldn't even be cutting that one! This isn't just me talking. No, actually, it is just you talking. All right, look, take this pencil. Try to break it. (whimpers mockingly) Take a whole stack of pencils. (grunts) That's how strong we are! That's how strong I am! This is the type of insanity I have to deal with with the Democrats. Listen, we have hundreds of e-mails telling us to hold the line. I want... I want to show you. (door opens) Gareth. Do you have the e-mails from the One Wayers? Yes, sir. (door closes) What? What? You have an expression on your face. What is it? Nothing. Did you notice your boss leans toward the right when he walks? What? He leans toward the right. Oh, is this, like, a Democratic taunt that I don't understand? Does he have trouble hearing in one ear? Is he... is he deaf in one ear? Hey, turn that up. You're very stream-of-consciousness. ...in an abundance of caution, the CDC is recalling three experimental blood pressure medications: Polemitras, Traviscine and Quinnox. What are we...? Shh. Any combination of blood pressure medications can have an adverse and unanticipated effect on the body. If you aren't sure you are on these medications... Polemitras, Traviscine and Quinnox. Is he right? No, they're just covering their ass. You don't know that. Your first instinct is always to suspect... Did your father use them? Those medications? I don't know. Did he have high blood pressure? No. See? They don't know what they're talking about. Okay. Look, I have a friend from medical school who works with the CDC. I'll call him and set up a lunch. And say what? Screwworms. No. I'll find out what they're thinking, what their evidence is. And we'll show them ours. (computer chimes) "We" won't do anything. I will. And Laurel. I think you should come, too. Wait, why Laurel and not me? Rochelle : Because, Gustav, you have a tendency to get excited. Gustav : People's heads are exploding. When are you supposed to get excited? Rochelle : No one will help us if we don't make a good impression. Gustav : So what are you saying? I'm not presentable? Is that it? Rochelle : I didn't say that. But, you know, you do have a tendency to come on strong and weird people out. Gustav : We're living in weird times. My behavior is entirely appropriate. I'm angry. We're losing our country. They're taking it away bit by bit. I know. And that's why Senator Wheatus needs your help. He's one of you. We're just sick of words; we need action. It's like the Red Coats all over again. Yes. And that's why Red Wheatus wants you to form the One Wayers. It's a grassroots campaign created and run by good citizens like yourselves. So, if we can meet tomorrow to discuss... Would you excuse me? Okay, look, I didn't have anything to do with the negotiations. They fell apart on their own. What's wrong? Nothing. Just... Thank you. Okay. For what? $750.10. That could be from anybody. Yeah, yeah, well... thank anybody. Okay, that's it. I just wanted to say thank you, so... Laurel. You got a second? Gareth : This shutdown is getting out of control. Compromise is getting even harder. I agree. There's someone else who agrees: Majority Leader Amarant. He just was in a screaming fight... with my boss. The Republican leader wants to compromise with the Democrats. He's worried that Wall Street's gonna pull their PAC money, but he doesn't have enough votes without your moderates. I know. You're wondering whether you should trust me. Uh-huh. (sighs) Well, I'll leave that to you. I'm leaving first. Luke :  Wait, who told you this? Is this from your chief of staff friend? Laurel :  Use this information if you want or don't,  but apparently, Amarant got into a screaming fight with Red Wheatus. Why would he undercut his own boss by telling you this? Are you sleeping with him? Okay, good night, Luke. (birds fluttering nearby) Hello? Gareth? (footsteps running) Hey, why aren't you helping me? Oh, come on. You want something, you come to my work. You don't follow me here. Do you listen to NPR? All Things Considered? You really want to let go of  All Things Considered? We will if we lose the NEA. Sir, this is a work matter. This is not some... You know what this is? It's from  The Splendid Table,  their pledge drive. That's what we'll lose: Big Bird, Ken Burns,  The Splendid Table... What is that? It's a rape button. Sends a GPS signal to the police. What are you, insane? This isn't a rape. I'm a member of Men Against Rape. You're carrying a knife! It's from  The Splendid Table! Don't you want to know whether Reverend Chambers solves the murder? I don't know what you're talking about. Grantchester  on  Masterpiece Theater! Don't you want to know?! If we lose the NEA, we won't! Go. Go, now! We are angry and we will not be denied. I don't care! Go! Seriously, go! 
 
 (chuckles): Oh, you know what you are? I know who I am, and I don't give a damn what you think I am. You're an obstructionist! Masterpiece Theater! This Old House! NOVA! Antiques Roadshow! Charlie Rose! Tavis Smiley! Don't look so nervous, Senator. Oh, I feel like I'm in a spy novel. If my caucus knew I was meeting with you, they would tar and feather me. Same here. So, I heard you had a screaming match with Red. Times are changing. Extremists used to make more sense. Now they don't care if we throw away the presidency, they don't care if we lose our PAC money. It's insane. So you want to end this, I want to end this. How do we do it? Well, I have 31 moderates, but they won't vote with you. Uh, there's this group, the One Wayers... they're making our life hell. If one of us even nods when a Democrat speaks, we'll lose our seat. Well, how about we kick it down the road? Sequestration? Yes. Agree to across-the-board budget cuts. Ten percent military, ten percent transportation... Ten percent health? Right. Now, they only go into effect in six months if we don't reach a budget agreement. Yeah, I think I can hold my 31 with that. But that still doesn't help us with Red. When he gets on the floor, nobody can hold their ground. Yeah, I have the same problem with Ella. I'll find some way to sideline them. All right, let's see what we can do. What are you looking for? Uh, a constituent who was here yesterday... Noah something. He had a cut on his head. What happened to yesterday's names? I cleared them out. Why would you do that? New policy. Destroying yesterday's names. You have some guests here. That's not the... I wasn't going to say anything weird. Something's odd, huh? Yes. Dex, you're with the CDC. You have to stop saying these explosions are from prescription medication. We're not saying that. We're saying that we're looking into it. I took all the pills 14 hours ago... nothing. What? I wanted to make sure they wouldn't make my head explode. Laurel : Gustav, you can't just perform experiments on yourself. Why aren't these dots just artifacts from a malfunctioning CT scan? Gustav : Because of the mandible there. See? Why isn't that just a dust mite? Because it's not. Look, I'm on your side. I think we're covering our ass at the CDC. But I have to have more than this. You think it's what? Cochliomyia hominivorax. I did my thesis on screwworm eradication. You really think they're back? I think there are bugs eating through human eardrums, embedding themselves in brains, and either changing people's personalities or making their heads explode. That's just one theory, of course. I'm sorry. I love this stuff. Me, too. What is your name again? Gustav. Dexter Wu. It's really a disgusting bug. I know. But it usually only infects livestock. Well, global warming has changed that equation, don't you think? Okay, this is what I suggest, Gustav. I'll take these CAT scans to my boss, and he'll dismiss them right off hand. But he'll need to see a human who is infected. A human? Yes. Do you know of any? Surprise! In other campaign news, civility is once again off the table. Nice apartment. Thanks. You know, all lives matter. Not just black lives. Okay. Um, Abby... this is gonna sound strange, but just keep an open mind. Rochelle is a doctor. Rochelle : At Mt. Vernon Memorial Hospital. And I'm helping her track a new kind of infection in the D.C. area... it's like Lyme disease. We don't know how serious. But we're worried you may have contracted it. Rochelle : It comes with loss of balance and deafness in one ear. Laurel : Have you noticed a change in your hearing? You're really jealous of my success, aren't you, Laurel? No, I'm-I'm just concerned for your welfare. Well, thank you for your concern, but I'm not sick. I'm doing well. Many people are asymptomatic. If you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick, easy, noninvasive test... So this is the nanny state now? Uninvited house calls? No. We're just here because I'm a friend and-and I saw these symptoms... It takes a village. Huh? Thanks for dropping by, Laurel. It's always good to see you. Well, that wasn't good. No. There might be another way. Rochelle : It's clearly unrelated to the blood pressure meds. It's probably a parasite like  spirometra erinaceieuropaei  or  naegleria fowleri. And those are? Think of them as a deadly type of Lyme disease that attacks the brain. The reason we called you, Anthony, is-is you have that power that, um... 2-64. Right. And this is someone who's resisting custody for observation. CDC could really benefit from investigating. (chuckles) You know, I, uh... I looked up screwworms. Pretty disgusting. I know, huh? And, uh, this woman, uh... Abby... she's a friend of mine. And she's shown signs of being infected, but she's resisted help. So we need you to help bring her in for a CAT scan. Is she in pain? Mm. No. Incoherent? No, but... she's changed. And she's shown some of the symptoms. I'll be right back. What's going on? Oh, hey, I didn't want to... Just thought I'd leave this with you. What is it? It's just information on... Information on...? Don't worry about it. I'll get it to you later. Hey, uh, Laurel, I'm gonna head out, but I'll take care of this. Good. Thanks. Right. Hi. Hey. Right. You two don't know each other. Um, Anthony, this is Gareth. Anthony : Nice to meet you. You, too. So, anyway... Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm heading over there in an hour. Good. Sorry, headed where? Your friend's place. Right. Good. Thanks. Nice to meet you, Gareth. You, too, Tony. Anthony. Nice guy. Shut up. Hey, are you gonna leave that or what? Sure. No rush. Just... read it when you can. Anthony : Ms. Summers, hi. Uh, I'm Agent Onofrio, FBI Criminal Division. I'm investigating the recent outbreak of CHIs. Uh, I don't know if you've been following that in the news. Have I done something wrong? No, not at all. Uh, we've been following an outbreak of a parasite infestation. We have reason to believe you can help us. We ask that you let the CDC conduct a quick, completely painless scan. It's really for your own safety. Are you arresting me? No. But we have the power to impel. We're just worried that, untreated, this condition can result in serious injury, even death. It'll only take 15 minutes. What if I say no? Then I will have to impel your cooperation. You're doing this for Laurel, aren't you? No, I'm doing it for the safety of the populace. Please, come with me. I'm gonna get my phone and my jacket, okay? I'm gonna record every step of this. Please do, ma'am. We welcome an engaged citizenry. (body thuds) (woman screams) Man : Call for help! Woman : Help! Someone help! We bought a domain name, and we'll be up and running in a few hours. Great. And you'll lay out the One Way philosophy there? Yes. Tom's writing the manifesto. Do you want to see it? No, the less we coordinate the better. What else? Jules : We'll have columns, blogs, comments and various instructive links to bomb manufacturing or how to alter bullets for better expansion. But also there will be a sign-up sheet for further actions. I... W-Wait. What? We'll have a sign-up sheet for further actions. No, no, uh, before that, you said something about links? Yes. On the Web site, to bomb-making materials. It's stuff you can find online now, but it's good to resource it all in one place. Why do you need links to bomb-making materials? For the people who don't know how to make them. It's all legal. Why do  we...  need bombs? To defend our country. From who? "Whom." Whom. Jules : Democrats. Socialists. Tax-and-spenders. Yeah, but you can't kill them. What do you mean? I mean you can't kill them. How do we stop them, then? It's another revolution. Red said so. Yeah, but he didn't say, "Pick up a musket and fight." Right, because we have Glocks. You can't do this. Seriously, guys. With all due respect, you said we can't coordinate. Yeah, I did say that, but... Are you serious with this crap? Laurel, you know, it's, uh... You leave this with me, and then you run away like a little baby. Okay, can we just step outside? Here, let's step outside. Stay here. Just stay out of my life. Okay, don't be throwing bombs into my life. I just thought you should know. Know what? Half the report was redacted. I'm not talking about the redactions. I'm talking about the photo of Onofrio... waterboarding. It wasn't him. It looked nothing like him. Just stop. Okay, if you think you're helping me, you're not. Okay, if you want to ignore the facts. They're not facts. Well... Just shh. Stop. (ringtone playing) Hello. Anthony, hi. (groans) How'd it go? What-what problem? What? (indistinct police radio chatter) ♪ ♪ (sniffling) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (crying softly) Anthony :  It had nothing to do with us. But you came here to take her? Yeah, but she was depressed. There were a lot of changes in her life. How do you know? Her friend said. What friend? Stacie Zara. (classical music playing) (Red and Ella arguing over TV) Hey, let's get this moving. This interview will last 20 minutes. You have your 30 votes? Close by. Your 31? Close enough. Here goes. Career suicide. It's for the country. Jim, ready? Hmm? Yes. All right, let's go. Senate's in session. Now, Senator? There's no one here. We are. Red :  Yeah, that's right, play the race card, 'cause that's what you people do. Ella :  "You people"? "You people." Do you see how these phrases flow so naturally from Senator Wheatus's lips? Red :  Honey, you don't have to worry about my lips, 'cause they're never getting near you, I can promise you. Ella :  Don't try to cheer me up. Senate is back in session. The chair recognizes the senator from Maryland. I move for unanimous consent vote. Uh, there's only three people here. You only need three for a unanimous consent vote. You're kidding? No, check the Senate rules. Luke : I move that the sequestration bill to reopen the government be approved without debate or amendment. Any objections? With no objections, all those in favor of calling a vote, please signify by saying, "Aye." Aye. Aye. Nay. No, "aye." Aye. Amarant : All those opposed? Thank you. The unanimous consent bill passes with no nays. The sequestration bill is now ready for a vote. Luke : Chair. The senator from Maryland is recognized. I move that the minimum 15-minute roll call be applied to the vote. Do I have a second? Second. All those in favor of the 15-minute time limit. Aye. Aye. Jim : Aye. Luke : Call the question. Amarant : Second. Red (over TV) :  I did not seek them out; they came to me. And these folks are patriotic Americans from all over the country who came to Washington to let their voices be heard. Ella :  Same with the No Wayers. They've heard what the One Wayers have said, and believe me, the No Wayers don't exist in a vacuum. Sergeant at arms :  Bill 112-28 will be... Man (over P.A.) :  All senators are needed on the floor to vote. Let's move. All senators are needed on the floor to vote. ...Senator Wheatus's One Wayers. Red : They're not  my  One Wayers. Where is she getting this? Misty :  Is there something you'd like to add, Senator? Uh, yes, um, unfortunately, there is a vote that I'm needed at. Uh... Well,  why don't we break away for a second, and we'll be right back. (whistles) Sergeant at arms : Senator Calastana. Senator Landers. Senator Charles Lane. Senator... Red : No! What? I have to get on the subway. Ella : Oh, come on! (groans) Sergeant at arms :  Senator Wicker. With 53 yeas and 23 nays, bill 112-28... passes. (applause, excited chatter) (door opens) Red, how good to see you. How was your 15 minutes of fame? You're dead. Hey, come at me. I'm ready. No, seriously. You're dead. Rochelle : I'm really sorry. Do you think this is the infection? That made her do it? I don't know. That's no infection I know of. She didn't want a CAT scan, so she jumped out of a window. And the police report says that she dove headfirst, so there wouldn't be enough evidence. She was depressed, Laurel. No, Stacie said she was depressed, but what if Stacie is infected, too? Well, that suggests some coordination between infected people. That makes no sense. (sighs) Am I getting paranoid? (chuckles) I don't know. When someone close to you dies, you look for reasons. Oh, hey, congratulations. On what? I heard your brother opened the government again. (knock at door) Oh. I'm so self-involved, I didn't even know. (laughs) That's great. Yeah. Anthony. Hi. Hi. Uh, sorry. I didn't know you had a guest. Actually, um, I'm heading out. Don't. I just wanted to see how you were doing. I got to head home anyway. Good night, Laurel. We'll be good. We will. Thanks. Uh, here. I got you cookies. I don't know why. Cookies are good. I just... I feel bad about today. I know. You want one? No. Sure. What about you? No. A drink maybe. So I saw the Senate torture report today. Somebody gave it to me. Yeah? Think you're in it. I am. So you were in Iraq? Yeah. And you did those things to people? What things? Enhanced interrogation. Waterboarding. Is that what you think? I don't know what I think. I just want to know what's true. What's true is I was a whistleblower. I'm only in the report 'cause I named names. Nothing more? Nothing more. There's this rumor that I was a mercenary, that I tortured, but it's not true. I'm sorry. For? For thinking the opposite. Sorry. I, um... I've been wanting to do that for a week now. Don't apologize. Have you noticed we both apologize a lot? I know. Yeah. Let's stop. Go to hell. Eat crap. (chuckles) In a wild night of secret voting, the so-called (lowers volume):  Moderate Rebellion passed a sequestration bill that kept the government open, at least temporarily. Well, I don't mean to brag, but this was statesmanship at its best. I'm very proud of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who voted for sequestration. Now our job will be to work toward... (phone vibrating) Yeah, I'm pretty bitchin'. You are, I won't deny it. Mm, it was so sweet. Red didn't know what hit him. The memory's gonna have to last for a while because we're heading into an ugly time. Why? What, you didn't see Red and Ella? No, what? (Luke chuckles) It's best to avert your eyes. Uh, their sound bites... (sighs) I'll see you tomorrow. Congratulations, Luke. Red :  Look, I don't condone violence, but I can understand why people would be passionate about this. This was basically a senatorial coup d'état. Jules :  I'm angry. (crowd chanting) Since when can the government just do what it wants? This is why voters have to get involved. We need a revolution to show politicians how angry we are. We are angry. (video stops) (truck beeping outside) (truck brakes squeal softly) Sorry about sleeping on the couch. I think I just nodded off and never came back. Mm-hmm. You sleep well? You good? What? I said sorry about sleeping on the couch. I think I nodded off...
