 [indistinct chatter] 
 I'm Laurel Healy. 
 And... I think I'm going insane. 
 Gareth : Hmm. 
 Well, if we're being honest, why "insane"? 
 Because I think bugs are eating people's brains and turning them stupid. 
 [laughs] 
 [quietly]: Yeah, well. 
 Huh. 
 That's not what I'd thought you'd say. 
 Yeah, me, either. 
 That's why I asked if you saw anything coming out of my ear the other night. I'm... 
 From your migraine? 
 Yes. No! 
 I don't get migraines. I just said that so I wouldn't sound crazy. 
 As opposed to now. 
 Yes. 
 Mm-hmm, okay. 
 So, you've seen bugs? 
 Yeah. 
 They-they tend to cluster around cherry blossoms. 
 How patriotic. 
 [laughs] I'm sorry. 
 No,  no, it should be made fun of. It's-it's crazy. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 I don't know. 
 It's not smart, I... 
 To be honest, I, um... 
 See those people over there? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 They're watching us. 
 Because they have bugs? 
 I'm just trying to connect the dots here. 
 Okay, he's listening to his ear buds, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How much you want to bet he's listening to "You Might Think" by The Cars? 
 More with The Cars. 
 [Gareth sighs] 
 Um, wait, you... 
 Hey. How you doing? 
 Good, you? 
 What music are you listening to? 
 Excuse me? 
 Laurel, why don't we just...? 
 [through headphones]  ♪ Think it's foolish... ♪ 
 You like The Cars? 
 I like to be left alone. 
 So do I. 
 Stop watching me. 
 Well? 
 Good guess. 
 Listen everywhere you go. 
 You'll hear it. 
 And what does that mean? 
 They like the bass line. 
 The bugs do? 
 Yes. I love being patronized. Keep it up. 
 [Gareth phone ringing] 
 I'm sorry. I have to take this. 
 Hello, Senator. 
 Where are you, buddy? 
 At drinks, sir. 
 Yeah, with your friend Lana, the bleeding heart liberal? 
 Laurel. 
 Well, I need some help with these CHls. 
 You know, you're poor departed predecessor Broadbent, his head exploded. 
 Did you know that? 
 I did, sir. 
 Why aren't the Feds doing anything about it? 
 What's wrong with them? I'll make some calls. I know you never liked Broadbent. That's not true, sir. But I'd still like you to do the best you can. And-and who's handling my calls tonight? Mike. The intern. Good. Tell Lana hi. Mike! Mike the intern! Oh! [grunting] Uh, yes, Senator? It's okay. Just calm down. Get me Louie Marchant on the line. All right? He'll know what this is regarding? I'm a senator. He's the head of the FBI. Yeah, he'll know what it's regarding. [sighs heavily] [violin playing softly] [buz of the bug] [violin more and more] Help yourself. No? I have Director Marchant on the line, Senator. Good, and get me some of those cherry blossoms from the vases in there. Louie? What's going on with these head explosions? Come on, I had an employee who died from one of these... Well, have you considered terrorism, sir? No, no, no. No, I'm just saying we have enemies of the state, don't we? Uh-uh. No, well, I've heard you were... No, I heard you were investigating a Hill staffer up here who had access to all the victims Lana something. Uh, Healy, wasn't it? [Cute voice] There you go, little lady. [stammers] Don't go yet. I need a favor. No, no, turn around. Turn around. I've been reading the chatter, Louie. This could be bio-terrorism. The terrorists have it out for me. Because of my stand. I'd bring in this Lana for questioning. [chuckles] Look, Louie. Ask your friends at CDC what happens when you're not responsive. One second. Mike? Mike the intern, right? Yes, sir. You can, you can turn around. What did you study in school? Oh, in-in college? Coding. "Coding," yeah? Good, good. Lean in. Nah... lean, lean your head. Oh. [in a whisper] Good. Yeah, good. All right. Take these home tonight. And I'm gonna need you bright and early tomorrow at the senate gym. You want me at the senate gym? Yeah, 7:00 a.m. Don't be late. Louie, here's what I want. I want a report by tomorrow morning. Meet me at the senate gym at 7:00 a.m. Stupid b*st*rd. Oh, come on, it isn't terrorism, sir. There is no medical reason for this. The chatter doesn't mean anything. The terrorists tell us they do it. Islamic Ra'id takes credit. We have to listen to it. Wait a minute, weren't we standing here a month ago, and you were saying it was terrorism and you were saying it wasn't? Yes. I changed my mind. Ra'id doesn't know what they're taking credit for. They read the news in  The Post,  then just try to mirror it. Well, I got to give this jack-ass senator a report tomorrow. Did we question some Hill staffer Lana Healy? Laurel Healy. Yes, sir. I think we should bring her in for some more tough questioning. Are you insane? She's the sister of a senator. She is? God, okay. Let me handle Wheatus. These senators love talking tough. Best not to enable them. Come on, pick it up, you slow poke. Oh, God. You converts are the worst. It doesn't matter if it's religion or exercise, everything is purity. [laughs] Have you met my intern Mike? Good kid. Nice to meet you. So, are the terrorists doing this, Louie? No, they aren't. Okay, let me tell you what I'm hearing. The Islamic Ra'id Front is taking credit for these head explosions and they're promising a new one once a week until the November elections. Yes, and last time they promised a pandemic of head lice. They scan  The Post,  and take credit for stories. I don't think you're taking these head explosions seriously enough, Director. Come on, Mike, two more. You can do it. Come on. Where are you hearing this, Red? Hearing what? About the terrorists taking credit? Well, my chief of staff is dating Lana Healy and she's supposedly hooked in. Come on, Mike. I think you need a little more weight. I'm gonna help you out. No. Okay, yeah. All right, now, come on, dig down. All right, be the beast, you got it. [grunting] My, my head hurts. Red? I'm an analyst. You're a senator. I don't tell you how to do your job. You don't tell me how to do mine. Well, uh, the only difference is that you don't hold my purse strings. Come on. Just a few more inches. Three, two, one... [groaning] Blast it! Mr. Cornish? Present. Oh. You didn't fill in all the blanks, Mr. Cornish. How may I help you? Oh, that's an interesting statue. Yes. I should probably get curtains. Do you know who it is? Major Hancock, I think. Ah, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. Civil War buff? No, just trivia. Anyway... Where's that door go? To the hall... why? Just wondering about other ways out of the office that don't take me through the reception. Okay. Anyway... I need you to stand, Laurel. You need me to stand? Yes. [chuckles] Why? Eh, it's customary. For? What are those? Disposable restraints. Uh, less obnoxious than handcuffs. Why are you here? To take you in for questioning. To take me in where? Ooh, I can't answer that. [laughs] Oh... I'm sorry. I need to talk to my brother. I'm sorry, you-you can't. Luke! Lu... [taser crackles quietly] [panting] [tension building] I'm so sorry about this. You seem like a nice person. ♪ ♪ [static crackling] ♪ ♪ [man whistles sharply] [blipping] [blipping continues] [static crackling] [indistinct conversations] [blipping] [blipping spikes] [blipping spikes] [spikes all over] [buzzing] She got a call. Who's it from? "Unknown Caller." Hi, you've reached Laurel Healy. I can't answer my phone right now. Please leave a message after the beep. ♪ [violin building tension] ♪ [static crackling] [music stops] She's late. We were supposed to meet for lunch an hour ago. I tried calling her. Do you think she's sick of us? Nah. Do you need something? [blipping spikes] Uh, yeah. Laurel. Scarlett : She's out. [blipping] Do you need something? Uh, no. I'm all right. Uh, Rochelle... Oh, excuse us. Ah... Mmm. Uh-huh. What is it? [quietly]: She's infected. It's picking up her high-frequency communication. Who are you calling? Laurel. You won't get her. Why am I here? To help with an investigation. Who are you? I'm Dr. Colin Mitchell. I'm a psychiatrist on retainer with the FBI. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the most tolerant, how would you describe your tolerance for pain? One. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the most fearful, how would you describe your fear of drowning? Kretchner : Do you take any heart medication, Ms. Healy? No. You ever been told by a health professional that you have an abnormal resting or exercise electrocardiogram? Why? It'll help us modify your treatment. What-what treatment? The treatment specified for your questioning. Is this about torture? Tor... [laughs] No. No. Is someone here planning to torture me? Kretchner : No. Then why am I here? To, uh... help with the investigation. [blood pressure cuff hisses] Kretchner : Oh, great. 120/70. You're quite healthy. Mentally, she's stable. There should be no significant mental aftereffects. Of course, I'd want to reanalyze her after each regimen. Physically? Blood pressure and pulse strong. I would suggest limiting regimens to five-minute sessions with breaks of ten minutes. I'll re-check her vital signs between sessions and we can modify the lengths based on that. Cornish : Risks of organ failure? Kretchner : Low. But I would avoid the abdominal area. She had her appendix out... eight years ago, and it left some scarring. Marchant : Open-handed slaps? Fine. And closed-fist contact in the chest area. She'll accuse me of assaulting her. Just want to warn you. Why? Because she's lying. [door opens] Ms. Healy. Thank you for your cooperation. We just have a few more questions. Him? No, no. What-what has he told you? If you don't mind coming with us...? Whatever he said, it's a lie. He attacked me. I already told them about your lies. This is illegal and you know it. Uh, not with a ticking clock scenario and with the consent of the two Intelligence chairs. Just... here, please. Wait, you said the two chairs of the Intelligence committee? Those chairs have changed since the senatorial handover. They're new. Have you checked with the new ones? As part of my questioning, an FBI lawyer must be present. If that lawyer is watching, the Intelligence committee has changed leadership. You need the consent of the two new leaders. Can I tell Mr. Ritter what this is regarding? Tell him it's regarding Laurel Healy. It's regarding Laurel Healy. What's wrong? I will get this back. Yeah. Laurel was supposed to meet me for lunch. And she didn't make it. Gustav : I have a GPS trigger on her cell. It got disconnected this morning leaving her office. The trigger sent out a warning that someone was trying to unlock its encryption. Hey, buddy, can you get in here a second? [Gustav's app blipping] [blipping stops, Gustav chuckles weakly] Senator Red Wheatus. [clears throat] Dr. Bobb. Rochelle. Daudier. Well. Nice to meet you both. I do think black lives matter. Mm-hmm. Let's go. Marchant : Uh, actually, sir, this is only open to SCI-four clearance today. Ooh, sorry. It's my first time doing this. Ah! Senator Healy. Thanks for joining us. It's just the two chairs today? Yes, sir. Emergency session. Well, I'll leave you two. [clears throat] We have a C-dash-5 scenario... A possible bioterrorism attack within the Capitol grounds... And we are asking for Appendix Q interrogation protocol. This is about the head explosion this morning? What head explosion? One of my interns, at the senate gym. Poor kid. A terrible tragedy. Just... boom. Clearly, terrorists are coming after me because of my strong stand on terrorism. I thought the CDC was pursuing these strokes as a physical ailment. We have some chatter suggesting the Islamic Ra'id Front is responsible and plans to conduct more attacks in the future. That chatter isn't determinative. But the threat is serious enough that we must take it... seriously. Who is it you have in custody? Marchant : A local D.C. resident who has connections to the victims and sympathies with the Ra'id Front. Good. Where do I sign? Let's go, Luke. It's Fort Apache time. What were these sympathies with the Ra'ids? Excuse me? You said the suspect... Not a suspect. Merely a person of interest. Oh, the "person of interest" had sympathies with the Ra'id Front. What were these sympathies? This person tried to hide the identity of a known Ra'id sympathizer, an ambulance driver, from our inspectors. If it weren't for the ticking clock scenario, we probably wouldn't ask for such extreme measures, but we can't risk another death on Capitol Hill. We need to move fast. No, I want to see the stats on this person of interest. Come on! Are you kidding me? They're coming after me, Luke! Marchant : Sorry, Senator, we can't reveal those details at this time. Is this about your bug fixation? Shut up, Red. Red : Because if there is another head explosion on my staff, you might as well kiss your chances for 2020 good-bye. All right, well, this should not be a political calculation. Red : That's right! It shouldn't be. This is about terrorism. You don't mess around with terrorism. I will brief you throughout the day, Senator. These are all approved Appendix Q interrogation methods. They're reasonable and appropriate. Especially given the circumstances. How many of them have you infected? With bugs? That's the wonderful thing. It's just me. I don't believe you. No, that's the great thing about this country. Everybody here is just doing their job. I don't have to do anything. What if I tell them? [laughs] Yes. Do. Tell them that I'm infected with bugs who have eaten half my brains. See how that goes over. Agent Onofrio has been infected. Half his brain has been eaten by bugs. I'm serious. Give me a lie detector test if you don't believe me. Might have a mental issue here. 
 
 [knocking] Yeah, what? Senator? Yes, what's wrong? The senator is busy right now. I just need a moment. Go ahead... What is it? Senator, do you know where your sister is? No, why? She hasn't been in the office the last four hours. And someone is trying to break the encryption on her phone. I'll tell Cornish we can get started with her. You're seeming pretty anxious about this. Why is that? I want to stop the terrorists. Why else? [phone ringing] Hello? Luke :  You know who this is, Agent. I do. I want to know who is the subject of your interrogation? I can't say that, sir. You seem the most  against this interrogation... Why is that? Can't say that, sir. If you're having a pang of conscience, Agent. It's best to follow through. Half-measures help no one. I can't say any more. Ask about Laurel directly. Agent, answer me yes or no. Is my sister in your custody? [sighs] Agent? Okay, then let me I'll count to five. If my sister is in some way being held there, don't hang up. One, two, three, four... five. Are you still on the line, Agent? I am. Thank you. They have her. What are you gonna do? [Luke chuckles] Raise holy hell. Get me Director Marchant on the line now. Gareth? Thanks. [Gustav's app blipping] [whispering]: She's communicating to someone. [app blipping] Gustav : This is creepy. Mm-hmm. [humming] I got him. Director Marchant. Do you have my sister in custody? No. Where you getting that? From within your office. Senator, I can tell you without hesitation I have no idea where your sister is. All right, you tell me she's not the reason for your Appendix Q request? That is correct. She is not. And you're not about to use enhanced questioning techniques on her? As ridiculous as your question is, Senator, I can answer honestly we are not. Then why am I getting different information coming out of your office? Senator, you have received my answer. Why don't you let us get back to our important work. Actually, I have a better idea. You've just be subpoenaed to a special meeting of the Intelligence Committee. Come on, you're kidding. No, sir. The ranking member can ask for a committee vote on all chair directives. I am doing that now. Senator, this is ticking-clock scenario. Just this morning I watched the head of a Hill staffer explode in my face. Yes. And that's why we're expediting the work of this committee. We expect you here within the hour, Director. This is a mistake, sir. Yep. Well, I make them from time to time. See you in an hour. Have you ever been in contact with the Islamic Ra'id Front? No. Do you know what the Islamic Ra'id Front is? No. Then how do you know you weren't in contact with it? To the best of my knowledge, I have not been in contact with Islamic Ra'id Front. Do you know who Ali Wasem is? I do not. You'd ever met him? No. See? There's a lie right there, Laurel. You have met Ali Wasem. He was the driver of the ambulance in which Dr. Daudier's catastrophic head injury took place. I didn't know his name. Agent Onofrio mentioned his name to you. Yes, but that was weeks ago. Okay. Who is this? Gustav :  No, not on the phone. We can't talk on the phone. Laurel :  Come on, this is just getting paranoid. Gustav :  No, not paranoid. Smart. I'll meet you at the usual place. You were surveilling my calls? Yes. Who were you on the phone with? A friend. And your friend's name? If I tell you, you'll bring him in for questioning, right? Right. Well, then I can't tell you. You think you're being noble and good by staying committed to a friend. But to me, it looks like you're hiding something; something that will... hurt this country. Are you patriotic, Laurel? What do you know about Anthony? Agent Onofrio? I'm not here to answer questions. Did you know that his brain has been eaten by bugs? Did you know that? There might be mental illness here. And we can't aggressively interrogate a subject with delusional disorder, with psychotic symptoms... In what way is she psychotic? She thinks her interrogators are bug creatures. [groans] All right, I'll get approval. [indistinct chatter] You are gonna regret this. No, you will. Now, people don't like torture. In fact, one of your own caucus members doesn't like torture... Senator Hodges, the war hero? Hi, Chuck. Let's get this over with. Oh, oh, that's what you're hanging your hat on? Unfortunately, some of your caucus members are ready to flee to me. Especially after the country sees how you want to coddle terrorists. Mm-mm. [static crackling] [panting] Ah... damn it! What? Damn it. I think I lost him. They must need to be in range of each other. 50 feet or so. So, we can't locate Laurel? No, I thought we could follow the bug people to where they were holding Laurel... Did you record their communication? What? Their high-frequency communication... Did you record it? Yeah. [blipping] Good, send that out. What do you mean? Well, instead of tracking people who send out that signal, can you send it out as if it were you? [chuckles] Yes. Then do it. [stammers] I would've come to that. I'm sure you would have. The matter under discussion involves an Appendix Q scenario. That means a time-sensitive ticking-bomb terrorist attack. I would encourage us to expedite these proceedings by keeping our comments to a minimum. Lives are at stake. Anything more, Senator? No. There's nothing more from me. All my questions have been answered prior to this meeting. [clears throat] Director Marchant? Now, how do you define Appendix Q interrogation allowances? The agency will be allowed more forward leaning interview methods when there's an impending terrorist attack. And how do those methods not constitute torture, as defined by Executive Order 13491? Well, just to begin, this country does not torture. Uh, it's not within our makeup... Is water-boarding torture, Director? Yes. So, we do not water-board? That is correct. Now, do we use water in our interviewing of suspects? Well, maybe a glass of water now and then, [committee laughing] if they ask. Do we use water in any other manner? Yes, infrequently. But it's well within... And how is the water used? Uh, in an exercise we refer to as "controlled immersion." Luke : And how does controlled immersion differ from water-boarding? Marchant : The amount of water is reduced. Uh, the experience is more one of trying to catch your breath than simulated drowning... I want to be clear. These are terrorists! Do I need to show my colleague photos of victims of ISIS? Women and children. I-I would do a hell of a lot worse than immersion if it were up to me... Oh, I-I know you would do a hell of a lot worse... Senator, have you neglected to pay your cable bill again? It is a matter of national security and-and our national identity. Or have you just gone off the grid? Now, you said, you said it-it is... Your brother is going to lose. No. Americans don't like torture. It's why you have to lie and call it something else. Here's the thing about the American public. I was down in Abbeville, Louisiana. Best catfish in the country. And my car got stuck in the mud. This family of farmers came by. Got me out. Invited me home for dinner. Towed my car to a shop. Gave me a few hundred dollars to get me home. They had nothing. And they treated me like I was their son. That's the American people. They are great individually. Nicest people in the world. But get them in a group, voting? [indistinct arguing on TV] They turn vicious. Luke :  It's a matter of national identity. And I believe the American people to be smarter than that. [applause] Oh. Looks like your brother scored a point. But isn't the real question whether torture is effective? No, I think the real question is why do we have to look at it at all? Like, my car mechanic, Rodrigo, used to say, "Some things in life are better left mysterious." Why do we have to look at torture? Let's stop talking about it altogether. Yes, but don't we at least...? No. But... Shh. But... [crowd chattering] You're down by one vote. I-I count myself up by one. No, you lost a Republican. Who? Chuck Hodges. The war hero? No. No, he'll never vote for torture. No, he had to leave. He's not there. Wait, what? What happened? I don't know. Dad? Your friend, Chuck Hodges... Where is he? There. Not joggers. Why joggers? [blipping] See? Broadcast it. [beeps] [blipping] Crap. Crap. [blipping continues] Crap, crap, crap. Just stare back. He knows we're not one of them. He'll definitely know if we don't stare back. Just keep broadcasting. It's okay. What could he do? Kill us. [whispering]: Just act like them. How do you act like them? I don't know. Turn... slowly. [blipping continues] [sighs] Where are you going? Following him. Where? See if he leads us to Laurel. Luke  [on TV]:  Director Marchant, how do you define Appendix Q interrogation allowances? What's that? Flow control valve. It regulates the water pressure so the immersion doesn't reach to the level of torture. So it doesn't drown me? So you put the cloth over my face, and then you pour that over it for how long? One minute. And that simulates drowning? Immersion. And, hey, the vote could still go your way. [sighs] Luke :  We do not protect the American people by torturing them. Come on, Luke. ...danger and, by the way, puts our POWs... [indistinct chatter] [gavel banging] Okay, let's get voting. [indistinct chatter] Come on. Time's a-wasting. ♪ [tension building with violin and drum] ♪ Come on, everybody, take their seats, please. Where is he, Dad? I need him here. Out of pocket. The staff is saying he's at his daughter's dance recital. You're kidding? He couldn't wait to vote on this? No, it's not that. When I was in the senate, "daughter's dance recital" meant "sleeping with a mistress." Well, do you have any idea where? Give me an hour. I'll try, but hurry, Dad. Red : I'll ask for a motion on our Appendix Q understanding. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. I have a few words I'd like to share before we, uh... vote. [clears throat] Back in 1803... [panting] That's... that's not good. [sighs] He led us right back to where we started. Maybe you're wrong about what the message says. ♪♪ So what now? [sighs] This message you intercepted... Let me hear it. This is just a 500 kilohertz signal translated for our ears. Yeah. We don't know what it means, right? Right. Okay. Play it again. [blipping] Okay. So just broadcast part of it, just the first part. The...  "Oh,"  or whatever. And let's see what one of them does. Why? To find out what their words mean. What? You're, um... you're much smarter than I thought. You know I did graduate pre-med from Princeton? [muffled laugh] [whispers]: Oh, here he comes. [whispering]: Okay, try the first sound. [blipping] Do it again. [blipping] Be my guest. Let's try the second word. [blipping] [laughter] [laughing]: Oh, yeah. We're using this. Red :  Who knows who might be  the victim tomorrow of terrorists. Any of us. You, Luke. Your staff. Yes, and if we torture, all our enemies will use torture on our soldiers. Look at Jack Bauer. What did he have to do to keep America safe? Jack Bauer? That's a fictional character. He's not real. Justice Scalia used him as a legal argument. Yes, and it was insane then, just like it is insane now. Justice Scalia should be honored by people like you, not disrespected. This debate is far too critical. It's a debate about our national security and our national identity. [gavel banging] Let-Let's just vote! No, I have more to say. [door opening] Forget it. I'm done. Let's vote. I can count on your vote, Senator? Not with the public watching. That's why I tried to stay away. I have to vote  for  this. [sighs] Red :  All right, all those in favor of the current definition of Appendix Q, please signify by raising your hand. That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 11. That's 11 yeses, and I'll join in, making that a majority. Now, all those against. Sorry, Laurel. Guys. Part of me was wishing that went the other way. It still can. You don't need to do this. Yes, I do. I like you, but I have a job to do, and I believe in that job. I believe the country survives because I do my job. It doesn't. I-I don't know anything. I... I... I... We'll find out. Red :  Senators, you can't vote twice. All those who voted yes, please... ple-please refrain from voting no. All right, once again, all those against the current definition, please signify by raising your hands. One, two... [people murmuring] Senators. Again, you already voted yes. [blipping] Please refrain... [people murmuring] This is so cool. [muffled laughter] I think we can discount the no votes. We already have a "yes" confirmation. Now, excuse me, Mr. Chairman. We do  not  have a "yes" confirmation. The "yes" votes negated themselves by voting "no," also. Well, I think that mischaracterizes what happened. No, it's exactly what happened. [gavel bangs] Then let's vote again. Remember, senators, you can only vote once. Once. All those in favor of the motion, please signify by raising your hands. [blipping] [people murmuring] Red : Uh, Se... Uh, senators? [loud banging on walls, yelling and gasping] [loud, indistinct, overlapping chatter] [loud head-banging, loud chatter continues] Luke : You all right? [banging continues] We better get out of here. [camera's clicks] [loud thudding on wall] [gasps] Want a ride? Sure. [sighs] You sure you want out here, at work? Yes. Why? I would have taken the day off. [chuckles] No, there's too much to do. As-as part of my training, I, uh... I had to experience all the interrogations I was going to inflict on you. You were lucky. See you again. You're okay. Oh, my God, are you all right? We've been trying to find you. Rochelle : Your brother is going crazy. Where is he? I don't know how you did it, but thank you. [sighs] [sniffles] I thought I'd lost you. You did... for a while. Are you okay? Yeah. Laurel. Oh, my God, there you are. Dad. Oh. You okay? [static crackling] [blipping] [blipping] [dramatic music]
