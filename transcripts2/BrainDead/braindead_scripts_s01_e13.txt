 Laurel : I know what their plan is, and I think I know how to stop it. 
 (guitar continues playing in distance) 
 Okay. 
 38 days. Their countdown clock said 38 days. 
 I knew it sounded familiar. 
 War. 38 days to start war. 
 No, the war was a distraction. The internment camps were a distraction... They were never for internment. 
 They were hothouses. 
 A distraction from what? 
 Shh! 
 (guitar continues playing) 
 (sighs): Tsk. Oh, God. 
 (knocks) 
 Rochelle : A distraction... from what? 
 Cherry blossoms. 
 Global warming has extended the cherry blossom season, but it's ending. 
 In 38 days. 
 Right. Well, less now. 
 (exhales) 
 They need the cherry blossoms. 
 That's where they spawn. 
 That's why the hothouses. It's not just about spreading the blossoms to other states, it's about surviving here, now. 
 So what do we do? 
 We stop the building of this hothouse. 
 The one in Manassas. 
 No, no, no, no. It's almost done. 
 We need to sabotage it. 
 How? 
 We need full blueprints. Can you get them from Red? 
 I'll talk to Gareth. 
 And what about the vote on the other hothouses? 
 We still need to stop them. 
 Right. My brother's on it. 
 Nice. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 I feel like we should say something to each other.

 (giggles) 
 We're in this together. 
 It's us against the world. 
 The world won't know what hit it. 
 Ow. 
 Sorry about that. 
 Well! 
 Look who's here. 
 This is your son's girlfriend, Lana. 
 Laurel. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Ritter, hi. 
 Oh, call us Nora and Sam. I... 
 Nora : Gareth didn't tell us he had a girlfriend. 
 Red : Yeah. they're in town because of this terrible mugging. 
 It's the Democrats... Coddling inner-city terrorists. 
 Uh, sorry. 
 Didn't mean to offend you. 
 Sam : Oh! 
 You're a... Democrat. 
 Sam. 
 What? I-I didn't say anything... 
 Not just a Democrat. 
 Her brother's the leader of the rebellion in the senate. 
 He's your brother? 
 Would you do me a favor and get Senator... 
 There he is! 
 Hey, man of the hour. 
 We were just talking politics. 
 (awkward chuckle) 
 Nora : Gareth. Oh! 
 (grunts) ‭Oh! Sorry. 
 How are you doing? 
 Good, Mom. 
 You guys didn't need to come this far. 
 You got stabbed! Of course we'd come. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Red : We were just discussing you two. 
 You're a sly one, eh? 
 Not telling your parents you're dating a Democrat? 
 Especially so soon after she... dated Michael Moore. What? 
 Gareth. Do you have a minute? 
 (quietly): Sure. 
 (door closes) 
 Well, that was weird. 
 Yes. It was. 
 ‭Yep. 
 I need the blueprints for the hothouses. 
 What? You have them. 
 No, the full things. Can you get them? 
 I can try. Are... are you good? 
 Yeah. Yeah. What do you mean? 
 Just, my parents, and... I don't know what they were saying, and... they're kind of old-fashioned, and Red's kind of been a... 
 We could do it right here. 
 With your parents on the other side of the wall? 
 I have a lock. (chuckles) 
 Well, in that case. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I have to go. 
 I know. 
 Where is everybody? 
 Back in their offices. 
 They got tired. ‭What can we do? 
 We need to stop these hothouses from being built. 
 Well... I'm open to ideas. 
 What would bring the senators back? 
 Drama. 
 And what drama might that be? 
 (sighs) 
 You have a thought? 
 Eh, not a good one. 
 I'm open to bad ones. 
 Want to do me a favor? 
 That... depends. 
 Arrest me. 
 (scoffs, laughs) 
 (both laughing) 
 Oh... seriously. 
 And why would I do that? 
 (clears throat) 
 (people murmuring) 
 This is what happens with free speech! 
 I'm being dragged from this floor! 
 This sit-in is being shut down through fascist Republican tactics! 
 Seriously? 
 Did you see what the Republicans are doing? 
 Can you believe it? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Laurel :  Is everything all right? 
 There's no sign of any blueprints here, but there is a security... 
 (door opens) 
 Do you need anything, sir? 
 Uh, no, Gary. Thank you. 
 There is a security badge that might come in handy. 
 It looks like it's to the Manassas construction site. 
 You're kidding. 
 No. 
 And you won't get in trouble for this?  I hope not. 
 Okay. I'll tell Gustav and Rochelle. 
 Love you. 
 (excited chatter on TV) 
 Yes, I did just say that. 
 You did. 
 I'm not sure why. 
 It's just one of those things you say when you're hanging up. 
 Yeah. Red and I say it to each other all the time. 
 Okay. I'm hanging up now. 
 Hey. Love you.

 Hey, Red. How are you doing? 
 Not very good, Luke. 
 I'm just watching you on C-SPAN. 
 Quite a drama. Yes. 
 That's one thing I've learned from you: the voters like drama. 
 What do you need? 
 I think we should talk, you and me. 
 We have talked.  ‭No, no, no, no. 
 Come to my office. 
 We'll negotiate. Yeah?

 Director. How are you? 
 Not good. 
 Sorry to hear that. Health issue? 
 Mind if I turn this on? 
 And I especially condemn the strong-arm tactics of the Capitol Police. 
 I mean, come on, now, people... I think we should talk, Senator. We have talked, Director. No. You leaked, Senator. You were offered a CIA briefing, and you leaked. It's a criminal offense. ‭Yes, and the special prosecutor already investigated and found nothing. I didn't leak to the press, I didn't leak to anyone. No, the special prosecutor disappeared before he could find anything. And what is there to find? (chuckles) A witness. (singing on TV continues) (TV turns off) (knocks on glass) ‭You enjoy being a senator, sir, don't you? But if this comes out, that you leaked, you might have to resign. Laurel, this is Director Isenstadt from the CIA. I don't think you've met. Laurel : No. Senator, I think we should discuss this on our own. He was just threatening me. I thought you should hear. I would treat this more seriously. He thinks I leaked the CIA briefing. He says he has a witness. When you're in a more serious frame of mind, Senator... (tears paper) you and I should discuss your options. My options? Really? What might they be? Good to meet you, Ms. Healy. (sighs) (door opens) (chuckles softly) He's bluffing. Says he has a witness.

They're saying they have a witness who says Luke leaked. You were there. I was there. I didn't talk to the CIA, so did you? I told them the truth. You should try it sometime. You're seriously gonna hurt your son? No, I'm gonna tell the truth. Oh, really? Like the truth of how many times you screwed him over? (sighs) Come on, Laurel, this isn't personal. His first election, his first loss, what did you tell him? I just wanna go running. You told him to never embarrass the family like that again. And he didn't. He was in tears. You should've held him. Why are you doing this to me? It's not personal. He looked up to you. Luke wanted to be you, and you said he embarrassed you. I was trying to toughen him. No. No, you wanted to hurt him. You wanted to hurt him for losing. No, I didn't. That's all that ever mattered to you, just winning. What? Thanks for dropping by, Laurel. Let them out. Come back to us. I have to go running. You know, that was the exact moment that Luke lost his faith in you. He admired you, everything about you, before that. Make your son proud, Dad. You don't have to be who you were. ♪♪ I have to get cross-trainers. So what happened? I was talking to my dad, and... Shh! I was talking to my dad, and a bug... leaked out. ‭Why? Why did it leak out? I have no idea. He grabbed his ear before any more could. What was he doing? Nothing. We were just talking. But, he seemed sick. I think they're weakening. Rochelle : What was he talking about? He wasn't. Actually, I was. Something about telling Luke he embarrassed him after losing a Senate race. Shame. It's the most deep-seated human emotion. If there's any human part of him you can still reach, it's through shame. I don't think he was ashamed. I... Gustav : Come on, politicians can't feel ashamed. Rochelle : They're just like us. Try it, shame. It's the thing buried deepest in the mind than anything else. Here... He won't go into his jacket again until tonight, so I need that back by 8:00 p.m. This is great. Thanks. (sighs) Yes, thank you. No problem. Laurel, could I talk to you for a second? Sure. Look, this "I love you" thing is really just something I said automatically. I know. I just... ‭Anyway, I'm the commitment-phobe, so you don't need to say anything. What do you mean? What don't I have to say? Just that we shouldn't get too serious...

Forget it. (chuckles, groans) No, no. No, seriously, I didn't hear what you said. (chuckles) Maybe I love you, too. That's all. If the world's gonna end, I thought I should say it. Wait. Just wait.

What else did he say? It's not about me. It was never about me. He always loved you. More than me. What are you talking about? You really want to make him ashamed?

Ammonium nitrate fertilizer. Shame? Yes. It worked on my dad. The person is still in there. He can be reached. Yeah, Red really doesn't do shame. It's not his brand. Well, he was crying last week.
