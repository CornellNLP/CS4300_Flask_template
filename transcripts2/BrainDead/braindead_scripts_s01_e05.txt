 What'd you say? 
 (inhales, groans) 
 What? 
 I said, "Sorry about sleeping on the couch. I think I nodded off." 
 Can you not hear me? 
 Oh, a bit. What'd you say? 
 "Sorry about sleeping on the couch. I think I nodded off." 
 Oh. 
 (chuckles) 
 So that ear's better? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 It's probably my tinnitus. 
 I didn't notice it last night. 
 Well, it's always worse in the morning. 
 How'd you sleep? 
 Well. 
 You? 
 Good. 
 I have to get to work. 
 These field office meetings. I hate being late. 
 Can I use your restroom? 
 Sure. 
 Anthony, did you change the sheets? 
 Yeah, I-I hope that's all right. 
 I, uh... I can be a bit a**l, and there was a... you know, a wet spot. 
 Where are the dirty ones? 
 In the pantry. 
 I saw you had a washer, I just threw them in. 
 Again, I hope that's all right. 
 Laurel? 
 Yeah, yeah, it's all right. 
 Good. (sniffs) Hmm. 
 I smell like an ox. 
 I'll call you later. 
 Thanks for a great night. 
 (classical dramatic music) 
 Why? What did he do? 
 Nothing, he just had trouble hearing in one ear. 
 Oh, my God, he's a bug man. 
 No, stop. 
 He's cleaning your sheets while you're sleeping? 
 Seriously, is that something guys usually do? 
 Okay, I'm getting back to work. 
 Laurel, he's a bug man. 
 He could kill you. 
 What did he say? 
 Nothing. He had to rush off. 
 Right, to commune with other bug people. 
 You're looking at me like I'm crazy. I'm making sense here. 
 If he was infected, why wasn't Laurel infected? 
 Because you were sleeping on the couch, at least that's what you said, so the bugs just got to him. 
 Okay, can we return to the subject here? 
 This is the subject. 
 What do we do with the CDC? 
 I called Wu again. He wants to help, but he's running into some political headwinds at work. 
 What does that mean? 
 He needs someone to apply pressure to his boss at the CDC. 
 How do we do that? 
 We don't do that. 
 You do. 
 No, no. 
 I can't talk to my brother about this stuff. 
 He's very practical. He'll think we're insane... 
 Yes, if you tell him we're investigating brain-eating bugs. 
 But Lyme disease and Zika are just as weird as this. 
 We've come to accept it, but it's the same type of parasite. 
 Okay. Okay, I'll think on it. 
 Good. 
 And, uh... I'm leaving these. 
 What are those? 
 Gustav : Sedatives to give to your bug man. 
 I'm not giving him sedatives. 
 The only way to know if he's clean is to give him a CAT scan, and we know bug people don't want that. 
 And, uh... 
 Here are some brass knuckles, too. 
 I'm going back to work. 
 Can you stop calling them "bug people," please? 
 Take those. 
 So is that who you were sleeping with last night? 
 What? 
 I called back last night to thank you for the help with Amarant when some guy picked up. 
 Imagine my surprise. 
 No, it wasn't him. 
 No, so... who was it? 
 Just someone. 
 Oh, that's right, my life's an open book, but Laurel... 
 It's Anthony, Anthony the FBI guy. 
 Oh, yeah. Is it serious? 
 No, of course not. Laurel doesn't do serious. 
 Why am I being attacked this morning? 
 Have you noticed, you never give guys a second chance? 
 They always do one thing wrong, (snaps) and you drop them. 
 Oh, my God, is that true? 
 We're snobs. Face it. 
 The Healy children. 
 No one's up to our standards. 
 Okay. 
 Got to address the troops. 
 (door opens) 
 (ringtone playing) 
 Laurel : Hey, what are you doing? 
 Not much. What about you? 
 Oh, you know, just saving the world. 
 (chuckles) 
 I'm sorry if I was... weird this morning. 
 Oh, you weren't the weird one, I was. 
 Showing you my feminine cleaning side. 
 If that's the worst thing you show me, we'll be fine. 
 You want to get dinner tonight? 
 I can't. 
 I'm supposed to go to this party tonight for the government reopening... 
 Actually, do you want to come? 
 It's a work event, everybody trying to be bipartisan. 
 Yeah, sounds fun. 
 (laughing) No, it doesn't. 
 No, it does. What time? 
 8:00. 
 We have to stay at least an hour, but then we can... 
 I'll make you dinner. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Good. See you then. 
 Bye. 
 Luke :  Give yourselves a hand. 
 (applause) 
 We're back! 
 Man : Yes, we are. 
 The government is open for business, so let's show the people of Maryland what we can do. 
 (cheering and applause) 
 All right. 
 So where you all from? 
 Baltimore, Senator. 
 I'm Private Blaine. 
 This is Private First Class Tulley. 
 Hey. 
 And Lance Corporal Middleton. 
 Uh, actually, I'm from Cumberland. 
 Wouldn't be caught dead in Baltimore. 
 (chuckles) 
 Even though I probably will. 
 Well, let's not hope for that. 
 (laughter) 
 This is my sister, Laurel. 
 She takes care of constituents. 
 We know. We were briefed. 
 What are those there, Lance Corporal? 
 Toys for my one-year-old. 
 Her car seat hooks into my wheelchair here and here. 
 You have a one-year-old? 
 Lilly. 
 Best thing ever happened to me. 
 You should see us both crawling on the floor. 
 (grunts) 
 (laughter) 
 Luke : Why don't you all come on back and let's talk. 
 You sure? They told us not to press you, Senator. 
 It'd just be Laurel hearing our bitching. 
 Hey, if you want me gone... 
 No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 We were enrolled in the clinical drug trials, and they were halted during the government shutdown. 
 We need Congress to get NIH to restore funding, and some of us don't have a lot of time. 
 Meaning? 
 Me. Liver cancer. 
 In fact, I wasn't gonna come today. 
 It's hard to pull myself away from Lilly when she's ready to walk, but... 
 I convinced him. 
 He's the most critical. 
 How critical? 
 Sheila : Ten days. 
 Don't sugarcoat it, Sheila. Give it to them straight. 
 I'm just hoping to make it to Lilly's first birthday. 
 When is that? 
 July 4. (chuckles) 
 I know. Corny, huh? 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what's the best thing about my job? 
 I can't imagine. 
 I can do something about that. 
 I'm heading to the Committee on Veteran Affairs right now. 
 No one votes against veterans, so this'll be handled by the end of the day. 
 You sure? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Good, 'cause I liked him. 
 I know. Me, too. 
 I have something to ask of you. 
 What? I didn't ask anything of you. 
 You're on some committee giving funding to the CDC. 
 And they're saying that these fatal strokes are because of some bad blood pressure medicine, but we think they're wrong. 
 "We," meaning those two people in the conference room with you? 
 We're in touch with a Dr. Wu at the CDC. 
 He needs some political pressure applied to his bosses for them to look at other theories. 
 All you need to do is drop a word and they'll jump. 
 Okay, here's the thing, Laurel. 
 I'm gonna share with you a wonderful little civics lesson about the glory of our system of government. 
 Oh, boy. 
 Everybody hates everybody. 
 If the CDC were wrong about blood pressure medicine, the FDA would scream bloody murder because they approved it. 
 See, that's how I know your friends are wrong. 
 No one's screaming. Talk to you later, I'm late. 
 (sirens wailing in distance) 
 Mr. Chairman, as a first order of business, let's fast-track the refunding of drug trials for veterans. 
 No one's against it. 
 It's not on the agenda. 
 There's a vet from Afghanistan who won't survive the week if we delay. 
 Okay, I'll put you first in the rotation. 
 After the kiosk naming. 
 Ed Sharie. 
 His widow's here. 
 Right, got it. 
 It'll go fast. Everyone's for it. 
 Okay. (clears throat) 
 Let's get started. 
 Last session, we were considering renaming the West Entrance Capitol Kiosk the Sharie Kiosk after Ed Sharie, a decorated Capitol police officer who was killed in the line of duty. 
 And if there are no objections, I move we so vote. 
 I second... 
 Red : Mr. Chairman, point of information. 
 Are we really considering having a Capitol kiosk, a kiosk where little kids can buy candy bars, christened with a name sounding like "Sharia"? 
 I'm sorry, what? 
 I said, I'm wondering if this committee is fully aware that this name will sound to many visitors like "Sharia law"? 
 Senator, it's not named after Sharia. 
 It's named after Sharie. 
 Ed Sharie. 
 With an "E." 
 I'm not deaf, Senator. 
 I-I know the difference between an "A" and an "E." 
 But not everyone does, and therein lies the confusion, Mr. Chairman. 
 Wait, do you honestly think people are gonna... 
 I think many of us are concerned about political ads, which will suggest that we voted for "Sharia law." 
 Yeah, but... you didn't, so... 
 This is what I suggest. 
 Mr. Chairman, this kiosk, where I have enjoyed a coffee and a pastry many times, I believe it should be named after Ronald Reagan. 
 Oh, for God's sake. 
 (all murmuring) 
 Yes, 'cause we haven't named enough things after Ronald Reagan. 
 Wouldn't that be nice? 
 (overlapping chatter) 
 (gavel banging) 
 Okay, look. I would like to point out to you, sir, that Officer Sharie was not only a dedicated Capitol police officer but a decorated veteran. 
 I understand that, and I do not mean Officer Sharia any disrespect when I suggest that our former president was a veteran as well. 
 No, he wasn't. 
 Well, yes, he was. He served in World War II. 
 No, he made a movie in which he served in World War II. 
 And a very good one--  King's Row,  in which he lost both his legs. 
 Ella : Mr. Chairman, I find this entire proposal an outrage. 
 When can we name something after a woman? 
 Tell a woman to do something, then we will consider naming something... 
 Emma Goldman! 
 Why can't we call it the Emma Goldman kiosk? 
 Are you serious? A communist? 
 No, she was an honored socialist. 
 She was a communist! 
 No, she was not, learn your facts. 
 You want a woman? How about Nancy Reagan? 
 Or Ayn Rand? Ayn Rand. 
 Senator : And you know, I-I don't know about "kiosk" anyway, I mean, isn't that a French word? 
 Red : It is. It is a French word. 
 I think it should be Reagan Concessions. 
 Red : Yes, except not "concessions" because Reagan never conceded to anything. 
 (arguing continues) 
 Can't get one damned thing done. 
 Bastards. 
 What is that, Armed Services? 
 No. 
 CDC. 
 They're covering their ass by pointing fingers at us. 
 Who's us? 
 The FDA. 
 That the... blood pressure medicine? 
 Yeah. 
 How'd you know that? 
 So... if it's not this blood pressure medicine, what is it? 
 Excuse me? 
 These strokes, if it's not about the blood pressure medicine, what's causing them? 
 (jazz piano playing) 
 Hey, you're late. 
 It's 8:20. 
 Yeah, this isn't L.A. 
 D.C. expects you on time and to leave on time. 
 Hey, I like your guy. 
 My guy? 
 Yeah, your Fed. 
 Where is he? 
 At least Norway offers free college education to anyone... 
 Then go live there. No, seriously, you want to live in Norway, No, see, that's always then go. the Republicans' response. 
 My country, love it or leave it. 
 (chuckles) 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Laurel, Hi, I didn't know there were gonna be so many ignorant Republicans here. 
 This little fella here thought he could just spread his lies without fear of contradiction. 
 Anthony : You know what Maureen Dowd calls people who make up their own facts? 
 If you take facts... 
 Apple cart owners. 
 Apple cart owners, okay. 
 (Anthony and Red continue arguing) 
 Hey, I see they finally found something you can do. 
 Oh, you coming to check out your old offices? 
 Is it making you feel nostalgic? 
 Well, this is an improvement. 
 Can I get you a drink, ma'am? 
 Sure. Old Fashioned. 
 What's that? 
 That is a spinach and celery smoothie. 
 Would you like one? 
 No. 
 Good choice. 
 So it's not true, by the way. 
 Your little smear campaign. 
 (chuckles) "My little..." 
 Anthony. 
 The torture report. 
 Mm. 
 He was a whistleblower, not a waterboarder. 
 I could see how you would confuse the two. 
 It's the same amount of syllables. 
 Really? Is that what he said? 
 A whistleblower? 
 (arguing continues) 
 Here's your drink, ma'am. 
 What's this? 
 That is a cherry blossom garnish. 
 The senator suggested it. 
 I'm good, thanks. 
 Rochelle : He insisted on coming. 
 Okay, but, Gustav, you need to keep it together. 
 Why does everybody think that I can't handle myself? 
 He's giving us ten minutes. That's it. 
 We only talk about the screwworms, okay? Hmm? 
 Rochelle : It's not as odd as it may sound. 
 Lyme disease and Zika also involve a foreign entomological organism infecting human blood. 
 And Lyme disease affects 300,000 Americans a year. 
 Yes, and that's not it, there's... 
 (clears throat) 
 Yes, what they say is true. 
 These are small. 
 They're from a cat. 
 A CAT scan from a cat? 
 Luke, things are weird until they're not. 
 Yes, except when they stay weird. 
 So, what are the symptoms? 
 As far as we can tell, deafness in one ear, some imbalance, a heightened aggressiveness, disinterest in intimacy and sexual connection, an aversion to alcohol, and in some severe cases, death. 
 And that's how your father died? 
 Yes. 
 I never met him, but I talked to him on the phone. 
 He was quite impressive. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, this is what I can do. 
 Look, I need to deal with Veteran Affairs first. 
 How's that going? 
 It'll happen. 
 But not yet? 
 It'll happen. 
 Look, I need to sit down with the CDC spokesperson and discuss it, but I need for you to talk with this congressional adviser first. 
 Who is he? 
 She. Dr. Alaimo. (pen clicks) 
 A renowned entomologist. 
 I want her advice before I go make a fool of myself. 
 Thank you, Senator. 
 And maybe don't show her the "cat" scan. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'm sorry about your father. 
 He thinks we're crazy. 
 No. 
 No, he'll do what he says. 
 Mm. 
 So... 
 We put in our one hour? 
 We did. 
 So let me make you dinner. 
 What's that? 
 This? 
 Celery and spinach. Want to try some? 
 No, thanks. 
 You want some of mine? 
 Is it apple juice? 
 No, it's-it's an Old Fashioned. 
 No, thanks, though. 
 Sorry, it's a bit messy. 
 Really? Where? 
 The closets. 
 Very messy. 
 Okay, one amazing vegan meal coming up with just a little cinnamon, for fun. 
 You know what Maureen Dowd calls Republicans? 
 Apple cart owners. 
 (scoffs) She's so right. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Hey, are we okay? 
 I think so. 
 You just seem a little standoffish. 
 No, I... I just... 
 I want to give you space. I don't want to... rush things. 
 Give me your hand. 
 It's not an obligation. 
 (crash) 
 Anthony? 
 Anthony? 
 (dialing) 
 (knocking on door) 
 Gustav : Laurel, open up, it's me. 
 Yes. Oh. 
 Help me flip him over. 
 What the hell? 
 Come on. We only have ten minutes. 
 I put 12 sedatives in his power drink. 
 Gustav, you could've killed him! 
 He'll wake up with a headache, that's all. 
 Don't you want to know if he's a bug? 
 What is that? What are you doing? 
 It's how they draw out screwworms in Central America. 
 It's like a match with a tick. 
 This is insane. 
 They're drawn to the bacon. 
 You're making this up. 
 Check Wikipedia. 
 Well, maybe he's not infected. 
 We don't even know if he's infected. 
 Has he drunk alcohol? 
 Has he been... intimate? 
 Has he become more argumentative? 
 (clicks tongue) Then we need to examine his ears. 
 Which is the one he's deaf in? 
 (pounding on door) 
 Who is that? 
 I don't know. 
 This is not gonna look good. 
 You think? (pounding continues) 
 (and again) 
 Woman :  Tony, is she in there? You are such a scumbag. You could at least tell me to my face about your whore! 
 (tension building) 
 (ringtone plays) 
 (gustav gasping) 
 I hear that, Tony! That is not your ringtone! 
 
 
 
 (keys jangling, latch unlocking) 
 I'm coming in. 
 Out the back. Out the back, go. 
 I am very close to pummeling you. 
 Hey, hey, it worked out, didn't it? 
 No, it didn't. What worked out? 
 Look, maybe he's not a bug. 
 Maybe he's just a b*st*rd. 
 (ringtone plays) 
 Yes, hi? 
 Yeah, actually Luke is still working on that. 
 He thinks he'll hear news from Veteran Affairs tomorrow. 
 Why? 
 Oh, no. Which hospital? 
 (sad music) 
 How is he? 
 The nurse says he's in the early stages of hepatic failure. 
 Reversible if he gets the meds. 
 I'm saying it's going well. Is it? 
 Not yet, but it will. 
 Will it in time? 
 Laurel... 
 Hmm. 
 Lilly. 
 (sighs) Can I get a copy of this photo? 
 Probably, why? 
 It can help. 
 (sighs) 
 What we think is... 
 Shh! 
 Why am I looking at this? 
 Cochliomyia hominivorax. 
 This is a CAT scan. 
 This is not  Cochliomyia hominivorax. 
 Rochelle : Yes. We believe there's a screwworm in the brain of the patient. 
 Who are you again? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Just, just... 
 Show her the video. 
 Come on. 
 What am I looking at here? That isn't a bug. 
 Just give it a second, ma'am. 
 What is that? 
 We think it's a screwworm. 
 It's been burrowing into... 
 That is not a screwworm. 
 We think it's a hybrid. 
 You can think all you want, but that is not something I've ever seen in my life. 
 Where did you find it? 
 In my apartment. 
 No, no, show me on a map here. 
 There. 
 Has anyone else seen this? 
 Uh, yes, we think a friend of mine was infected by some, playing chess... here. 
 And Laurel said she saw some in her apartment. 
 Which is here. 
 Good. 
 Infestation clusters. 
 Let me find some pins. 
 We should probably talk this out, shouldn't we? 
 We should. You know, it was good to see you at the party last night. 
 I love it when Republicans and Democrats can, you know, blah-blah-blah. 
 Yeah. So why are you delaying the clinical trial vote? 
 I'm not delaying anything. 
 I'm urging us not to name a concession stand after Sharia law. 
 It is not Sharia law. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell me again, but slower. 
 'Cause you know how much I love to be patronized. 
 All right, this government is up and running less than two days, and we're deadlocked over a concession stand. 
 Go talk to Comrade Pollack. 
 It's not just me. 
 What's that? 
 A one-year-old named Lilly. 
 Sweet. 
 An illegitimate child of yours? 
 She is the daughter of an Iraqi War veteran who's dying of liver cancer unless we pass these clinical trials. 
 What's the veteran's name? 
 Brett Middleton. 
 And he's at Walter Reed? 
 Yes. 
 And you what? 
 You got some pictures taken with him? 
 What? 
 Well, you... you had some nice photos taken with him? 
 Him smiling, you smiling. 
 You save him, and he'll hug you, and there'll be more photos. 
 You'll save him from the big bad Republicans? 
 My God, not everything is about politics, Red. 
 (snorts) 
 Come on, even you don't believe that. 
 Here, take your sweet little photo to Comrade Pollack and get her to agree to naming the stand Ronald Reagan. 
 See what traction you get there. 
 Oh, I see. 
 You want to delay the vote on clinical trials because you know it'll win, and I'll get credit for saving a young man?! 
 Come on, don't act outraged. 
 You're looking at the presidency in 2020. 
 This fits right into your strategy. 
 "Boo-hoo, he saved my daddy. 
 He deserves your vote." 
 Come on, you don't like children. 
 No one likes children. 
 (grunting) 
 Hey. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 Yeah, it's me. 
 Who? 
 Oh, yeah, right. 
 Uh, so, how crazy is it? 
 Not too much crazy. 
 Maybe a little crazy. 
 They're on to something. 
 I don't know what yet. We're discussing eradication, but it won't embarrass you. 
 I'll send you something to validate. 
 You want to eradicate this new bug, you have to figure out how and where it reproduces. 
 The Mall? 
 Alaimo : Yes. 
 Then you have to figure out how they communicate. 
 Is it tactile, chemical, acoustical? 
 If it's a screwworm, perhaps pheromones... but it's not a screwworm. 
 And how do we do that? 
 How do we figure out how it communicates? 
 Go to the clusters. 
 Ow. 
 Here, the Mall, and here, near the Capitol. 
 Anthony : I'm sorry, Laurel. 
 For...? 
 Last night. What happened. 
 I-I should've told you. 
 I have a drinking problem. 
 That's why I didn't want to drink last night with you. 
 But you drank before at the bar. 
 And I shouldn't have. 
 I was happy. 
 But last night I hit bottom. 
 I-I just blacked out, woke up with food in my ears. 
 I don't even know what I drank, but it knocked the hell out of me. 
 I-If I were you... 
 I wouldn't want to talk to me, either, but... 
 I'm going back to AA. 
 I just wanted to tell you. 
 There was someone last night outside your door. 
 A woman. 
 Oh... 
 Jennifer. 
 Uh... (chuckles) 
 I was in a serious relationship with her when we met, but the other night with you changed everything. 
 I-I knew I had to end it with her before we went any further. 
 Tha-That's why I said that stuff about going slow. 
 Can I take you out tonight? 
 Just a friendly date. 
 I-I owe you a dinner anyway, one that doesn't end up in my ears. 
 Anthony. 
 Uh-oh. 
 No, just... 
 I think we should stay friends. 
 See how it goes. Okay? 
 I guess I can't blame you. 
 It's not... 
 One second, Anthony. 
 What the hell, Gustav? 
 Uh, this isn't about you. 
 You can't be following me. 
 I'm not. I was here first. 
 This is an infection cluster here. 
 The entomologist sent us. 
 Are you recording us? 
 No, I'm monitoring pheromones. 
 It's a possible way the bugs are communicating. 
 I adapted this app to test for pheromones... 
 (high-pitched squeal) Okay, I need my life to be normal again. 
 Shh. 
 (high-pitched squealing) 
 (mumbles) 
 (door closes) 
 What if it communicates through high-pitched frequencies undetectable to humans? 
 What if? What is a "what if"? 
 I saw a guy with a hearing aid walk past an infected person, and it screeched. 
 I mean, the hearing aid, it screeched. 
 That could be anything. 
 Or... 
 Could be a bad battery. 
 Or the frequency from this hybrid bug was causing feedback. Is that even possible? 
 (sighs) 
 The  Galleria mellonella,  the greater wax moth, it can sense sound up to 300 kilohertz, about 150 times higher than humans. 
 But it's highly unusual. 
 Where are you going? 
 I-I wasn't finished. 
 I have an app which detects and disrupts high frequency vibrations. 
 I'm-I'm going to the Mall to try it. 
 Wait. 
 I'll go, too. 
 Great to see you again, Polly. 
 You look taller now. 
 I am taller now. 
 That's what happens when you're the whip. 
 You gain three inches. 
 Just in height? 
 (chuckles) 
 Do you miss the D.A.'s office? 
 Do you? 
 I loved the drinks at 6:00. 
 I like the CDC better. It's quieter. 
 Okay. 
 That's a good segue. 
 (both laugh) 
 So... let's talk about these strokes, these... 
 CHIs. In the labs they're calling them "head pops." 
 How sensitive. (laughs) 
 It-It's not about blood pressure medicine, you know that? 
 No, I didn't know that. What is it about? 
 Bugs. 
 Bugs? 
 Like NSA bugs? 
 Insect bugs. 
 So, what kind of bugs? 
 Oh, they're highly invasive, and they cause... (moans) ...personality changes. 
 Their Latin name is something something  hominivorax,  which means "eater of man." 
 Really? 
 Eater of man? 
 Tell me more. 
 Oh, I have a CAT scan of one. 
 Polly :  Can you give me the MRI? 
 CAT scan. Sure. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 Mm, who's that? 
 Shh. 
 Hey. How's it going, hon? 
 Oh, come on, seriously. 
 Yeah, just, uh, finishing up a few things. 
 I ordered in, how about you? 
 Eh, you know, let me call you back in five minutes. 
 Uh, I love you, too. 
 Five minutes, huh? That's all I get? 
 That wasn't funny. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm so bad. 
 Maybe you need to punish me. 
 What have you found? 
 I don't know what I'm looking for. 
 Frequency spikes of 300 kilohertz or more. 
 (grunts) 
 Nope, nothing. 
 This where your friend got sick? 
 Yes. 
 (sighs) 
 We must come back in the morning. It's too dark. 
 Just a few more minutes. 
 No. Time to go. 
 Tomorrow then? 
 Tomorrow. Whatever's here isn't going away. 
 Excuse me, I... I had a talk with Red. 
 He wants to avoid a vote on clinical trials because he knows it will win. 
 Yeah. 
 (chuckles) 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 What am I doing? 
 Yes. Stop talking about bugs. 
 Wait, I don't understand, Dad. H-How did you... 
 Where-Where's this coming from? 
 You talked to the CDC, saying that bugs are crawling in people's heads and making them explode, right? 
 No, I said they should look into it. 
 Oh, my God. Luke, you can't do that. 
 No one gives a rat's ass about sexual indiscretion. 
 The only thing that can kill a political career is ridicule. 
 So knock it off. 
 Now, how did you know what I said to... 
 Some CDC lawyer's out there, saying all you could talk about was bugs. 
 Damn it. 
 Get me the number for Polly Savident at the CDC. 
 Right now. 
 Son, you can't talk to her. 
 It'll only make things worse. 
 She's out to hurt you. 
 So, what do I do? 
 Say it's a lie. Say you were misunderstood. 
 Oh, stupid. 
 I  was  stupid. 
 Where's all this bug stuff coming from, anyway? 
 When did you start worrying about bugs? 
 Okay, forget it. 
 Uh, where are you on Veterans Affairs? 
 Stuck. 
 Okay, I've been thinking, it's just as good if the Republicans let him die. 
 You did everything you could. 
 Republican intransigence resulted in a good man's death, but you fought for him. 
 It's a theme for a presidential run. 
 Republican brinksmanship versus a good man who wants to get things done. 
 Where you going? 
 Not-not to the CDC lawyer. 
 It's over. 
 How is he? 
 Not good, but he's awake. 
 You know my sister, right? 
 Hello, Lance Corporal. 
 Senator. 
 My new best friend. 
 No, but I do have another new best friend. 
 Senator Wheatus. 
 Hey, Brett. 
 How are you, buddy? 
 Dying. 
 Well... let's see if there's something we can do about that. 
 Are you... are you up for a photo? 
 Whatever you need, sir. 
 All right. 
 How's the light there? 
 (camera shutter clicking) 
 You're letting Red take the credit? 
 We were deadlocked. I'm breaking the deadlock. 
 Boom. 
 Laurel, I'm gonna ask you a favor right now. 
 It's gonna start as a favor and then it's gonna become a demand. 
 A demand? 
 Yes, as your boss, your employer. 
 Stop with the bug talk. 
 I don't understand. 
 All right, so let me be clear. 
 Don't ever mention bugs to me again. Ever. 
 What? Didn't you talk to the entomologist? 
 Rochelle said she was on our side. 
 No. 
 She called this morning. She said you're all crazy. 
 So stop it. 
 Never again. 
 Okay? 
 Okay, let's get that thumb up there a little higher, okay, buddy? 
 Dr. Alaimo. 
 Dr. Alaimo? 
 What happened? 
 I don't understand. 
 You told Senator Healy we were crazy, but yesterday you thought an infestation made sense. 
 Yes, but that was yesterday. 
 It's not today. 
 What changed? 
 She did. 
 (laughing) I don't... 
 What? 
 Shh. 
 (whispering) Can you hear me, Doctor? 
 You're deaf in that ear, aren't you? 
 I think it's time for you to go. 
 You found some bugs last night? 
 No. 
 I got a good night's sleep, that's all. 
 ("Jisas, Masta Mi Save"  plays) 
 (knocking at door) 
 Now, before you say, "I didn't order any pizza," let me just say, this is an apology pizza. 
 Pineapple. 
 And this... is  Love Actually,  the best movie ever made. 
 These are apology flowers. 
 Anthony... 
 No, it's not boyfriend stuff. 
 It's the 12 steps. 
 "Make direct amends to people I've harmed." 
 I harmed you. 
 Pizza's extra. 
 ("Jump for My Love"  by The Pointer Sisters plays) 
 Anthony :  This is my favorite part, Hugh Grant dancing. 
 You seen it? 
 Uh-huh. 
 I just... I never get bored with it. 
 (Anthony laughs) 
 Anthony. 
 Yeah? 
 We're just friends, right? 
 Yeah. How's your pizza?

 You know, people say that we in Washington are incapable of working together. 
 Well, this great occasion proves them wrong. 
 For today, we are announcing the restoration of an important program to serve our brave warriors. 
 Brett, I want to thank you for your service. 
 Your country has your back. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Thank you for all you've done for me and for all of us. 
 (applause) 
 I can't believe this. You just handed it to him. 
 Is this Laurel's doing? 
 What? No, Dad. 
 Just let it go. 
 (applause) 
 What have I always said? 
 Don't be tempted by the small moves. 
 This is a small move you're gonna regret. 
 Red will have more power and he'll just hurt the next Brett. 
 (ringtone playing, phone buzzing) 
 Hello. 
 Oh, hey. 
 I thought you were screening calls. 
 I just wanted to say I... 
 think your brother was pretty cool for doing what he did. 
 What did he do? 
 He let my boss take the credit. 
 For the clinical trials. 
 Yeah, he can be good sometimes. 
 And, hey,  about Anthony, I-I've been a bit of a jerk. 
 No, you haven't. 
 Yes, I have. 
 Gareth, seriously... you haven't. 
 Okay, I haven't. 
 (knocking at door) 
 Gareth, can you hang on a second? 
 Sure, hey, what is it? 
 There's someone at my door. 
 Who is it? 
 It's me. 
 (sighs) 
 Gareth, I'll call you back. 
 Hey, you all right? 
 I am. 
 I'll talk to you. 
 Okay, I have a quick thing. 
 Thank you for the brass knuckles. 
 Oh. 
 You're welcome. 
 I have something else, too. 
 (groans) 
 Mosquito netting. 
 Thanks, but I don't think... actually, no, good, thanks. 
 You have something else, too. 
 Coasters and tape. 
 Put this over your ears. 
 What's that? 
 Flowers. I'm throwing them out. 
 Why? 
 Anthony bought them. 
 Oh, good. 
 You going to bed? 
 I think so. 
 Want me to put this over your bed? 
 No, that's okay, I'll do it. 
 Okay. 
 Promise, though. 
 I will. 
 And, uh... put these over your ears. 
 Got it.
