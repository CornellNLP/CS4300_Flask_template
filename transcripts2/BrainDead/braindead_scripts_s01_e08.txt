 Some people with Space Bugs in their heads experience stumbling, loss of balance or loss of hearing in one ear. This is normal since part of your brain needs to come out somewhere. Some people with Space Bugs report an aversion to s*x and also alcohol, plus an interest in vegetables, vegetable juices, and the curative properties of juicing in general.

 [whispers]: I thought I'd lost you. 
 You did... for a while. 
 Laurel, oh, my God, there you are. 
 Dad. 
 [app squeals] 
 [whispering]: He's infected. Laurel's dad. 
 Rochelle : Wait, shh. You don't know that. 
 It's this... 
 Just... get closer. 
 [app squeals] 
 You need to find a way to silence that. 
 [app squeals] 
 Oh. 
 [squealing stops] 
 This must be Laurel's friends? Hello. 
 Dean Healy. 
 This is Rochelle and Gustav, Dad. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 What you got there? 
 Uh, a-a speaker system. 
 Uh, do you mind? 
 Am I supposed to be hearing something or...? 
 Uh, eh... 
 Gustav, we should probably... go. 
 Laurel, so glad you're safe. 
 Thank you, both. 
 [whispering]: You need to tell her. 
 [whispering]: What? That her dad is infected? 
 Yes. 
 Your machine said no. 
 No, it didn't. 
 It just stopped. 
 It's broken. 
 [theme music playing] 
 Seems like a simple enough concept, doesn't it? 
 One person, one vote. 
 Too bad no one got the message to the senators on the "torture panel." 
 ["Anvil Chorus" plays on television] 
 Red : Where are we, buddy? 
 We're set up. 
 What are you looking for, Senator? 
 This is the Capitol security footage? 
 Yeah, from today and yesterday. Why? 
 Red : Get me the hallway outside the Intelligence Committee hearing. 
 There! 
 Those people exiting. 
 Freeze frame there. 
 Those two black people. 
 Who are they? And I'm not being racist. 
 I'm just being descriptive. 
 If they were dwarves, I'd say, "Those two dwarves." 
 I don't think you can say dwarves, either. 
 Well, good thing they're not dwarves. 
 Who are they? 
 Come on, they were here yesterday. 
 Dr. Bobb, and her, the... Rachel something. 
 What were they here about? 
 Information on the Intelligence meeting. 
 Terrorist sympathizers. 
 It starts in San Bernadino. 
 It comes here. 
 All right. Get that printed up, and have it ready for the committee today.

 Where are you going? I'll walk you. 
 I was walking to you. 
 Let me go first. 
 Okay, forget what I said about bugs. 
 I-I don't want that to get in the way... 
 No, wait, nothing is gonna get in the way. 
 We just have so many other hurdles, and I don't want you to think that I'm insane. 
 No, it's just a weird time, and any one explanation makes just as much sense as any other. 
 Look, I just want to act normal from now on. 
 I just want to just get a burger and fries and a beer. 
 I don't want to... 
 Your friends are in trouble. 
 What? 
 Your friends, Dr. Bobb and Rochelle. 
 They're in trouble. 
 How? 
 My boss saw surveillance footage of them leaving the Intelligence meeting, and he thinks that they had something to do with the failed vote. 
 What will he do? 
 I don't know. 
 It's working. 
 It's not broken. 
 Meaning? 
 They changed their frequency. 
 They knew we were on to them, and they changed their frequency. 
 You don't know that, Gustav. 
 I know that you should be telling Laurel about her father. 
 Laurel : Okay, guys, we need to talk. 
 Hi, Laurel. 
 Hi. You're so nice... today. 
 Good to see you. 
 What? 
 [Gustav clears throat] 
 Well, uh, nothing. 
 What do you mean? 
 [whispering]: Tell her. 
 [whispering]: No, I... 
 Laurel : Okay. 
 What? 
 We're not certain about this, because Gustav's toy here went on the fritz... 
 Ah, it's not a toy, and it didn't go on the fritz. 
 Stop. 
 Rochelle. 
 Gustav's machine reacts to high-frequency communication... 
 500 kilohertz. 
 And he was seeing who was infected and who wasn't. 
 Most of D.C. is largely untouched. 
 Most of the infections are on Capitol Hill, and only five percent here are infected. 
 Anyway, when we were in your office, there seemed to be a high-frequency communication coming from... coming from your dad. 
 It's not certain. 
 It could mean anything. 
 It couldn't mean anything. 
 I got to go. 
 Laurel, it might not mean anything. 
 I'll talk to you. 
 Be careful, by the way. 
 Senator Wheatus saw you leaving the hearing yesterday and Gareth doesn't know what he'll do. 
 [gavel pounding] 
 Thank you. 
 I'm calling the Select Committee on Intelligence to order. 
 I need everyone to sit down. 
 The matter under discussion today is the recent spate of catastrophic head injuries. 
 Red : Explosions. 
 Let's just drop the euphemism and call them what they are. 
 Luke : Madam Chair, can we have some order here? 
 [gavel pounds] 
 Yes, that's enough. 
 Senator, you will have an opportunity to speak. 
 I would like to be recognized, Madam Chair. 
 I'm-I'm, uh, I'm raising my hand. 
 Why not both hands? 
 [laughter] 
 Quiet. 
 Yes, the... senator from Maryland is recognized. 
 As per prior agreement, I have a witness. 
 Ahmed Kadhimiya. 
 I'm a former freedom fighter in the Islamic Ra'id Front. 
 Red : And, uh, could you tell us how you became a member of the Ra'id, and what you did for this terrorist organization? 
 Yes. 
 My mother was killed in a drone attack. 
 I had studied chemistry, so I helped the Ra'id create a new methane-based compound. 
 And what did this compound do? 
 When injected under the skin, it would make a head explode. 
 [people gasping and murmuring] 
 Red : Thank you, Mr. Kadhimiya. 
 And you did this with the approval of the Syrian officials? 
 I did. 
 [people murmuring] 
 Luke : W-wait a minute, wait a minute, wait. 
 Are-are you seriously saying this is state-sponsored terrorism? 
 I'm not saying anything. I have a witness. 
 All right, this is not a matter for this committee. 
 Only the president can conduct international affairs. 
 Red : This is about war, and only Congress has the right to declare war. 
 You will not be satisfied until this country is at war. 
 Red :  You won't be satisfied until this country is made the laughingstock of the world. 
 Oh, Laurel. 
 Hey, you startled me. 
 [Politicians arguing] 
 How are you, Dad? 
 Not good. 
 Have you been watching this? 
 Red's sandbagging your brother. 
 These Republicans, all they want is to start another war. Look at this. 
 Red :  Mr. Kadhimiya's testimony... 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Red :  Fire up our bombers... 
 You feeling okay? 
 Yeah, sure. Why? 
 I mean, I was just about to go running. 
 How's your hearing? 
 My hearing? 
 Good. 
 [whispering]: Can you hear me? 
 Yes, I can hear you. 
 I'm not in the grave yet. 
 [both laugh] 
 Just humor me, Dad. 
 Okay, what do you need? 
 [whispering]: How about now? 
 I'm gonna go on a run now, Laurel. 
 If you want me to get a hearing aid, I'll talk to your mom, but I'm not as old as you think. 
 Dad. 
 You couldn't hear me, could you? 
 I can always hear you, dear. 
 A father can always hear his daughter.

 Anything from the ranking chair? 
 Yes, thank you, Madam... 
 Uh, let me. 
 I'll rip him a new one. 
 Ella, let's keep it... 
 Uh, thank you for speaking here today, Ahmed. 
 Do you blame America for your radicalism? 
 Do I...? 
 [camera shutters clicking] 
 I... What do you mean? 
 You said your mother was killed in a drone attack? 
 Don't you blame America for this? 
 No. 
 It was an Iranian drone. 
 But built with our technology. 
 No. Chinese. 
 But isn't America the real culprit here, because we... created the... idea... of the drone? 
 Let me... let me ask this a different way. 
 Why do you hate... 
 America? 
 Because of... [camera shutters clicking] your freedom? 
 Our entitlement. 
 Our wealth inequality. 
 The top one percent owns everything. 
 I mean, look at our bankers. 
 Isn't that why you hate America? 
 [stammer]: I-I... I guess. 
 So, we can't blame you, can we? 
 We caused this terrorism. 
 We are the real culprits. 
 The rich get richer, 
 Laurel! 
 the poor get poorer. 
 You sure you don't have to get back to work?

 What are you doing in there?

 Hey, Rochelle, I'm sending you a photo of some pills. 
 Can you tell me what they're for? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 But I think you should get over here. 
 Why? 
 We think we caught one. 
 Ow. My head hurts. 
 You really took him down with this? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Wow. 
 [laughs] 
 I wasn't trying to hurt you. 
 Gustav : Shut up, bug man. 
 You did this. 
 Yeah, because you startled me. 
 I-I just wanted to steal your knives and get out of here. 
 Seriously? That's your story? 
 Knives? 
 Look, you can't keep me here. 
 I-I have a family. They'll come looking for me. What is this? 
 Gustav : It's to keep you from sending out high-frequency bug signals. 
 Oh, my God, you're crazy. 
 What are you doing? 
 Checking your ear. 
 What's the bug agenda? 
 What are you talking about? 
 The bug agenda? 
 What is it? Are you from outer space? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm from outer space, just here for a visit. 
 What is that, bug sarcasm? 
 Anything? 
 Some scar tissue in one ear. 
 But it could've healed. 
 Or it could be from a near-drowning accident I had when I was six. 
 Oh, that sounded rehearsed, didn't it? 
 Look, let me go now, and I won't press charges. 
 Press charges? 
 You broke into my apartment and tried to stab me. 
 Then get the police. Call them. 
 What do you think? 
 Are you okay? 
 Does Dad have Parkinson's? 
 Hmm. 
 Did Dad say something? 
 No. 
 I was looking through his medicine cabinet. 
 Levodopa? 
 [sighs] 
 Yes. He does. 
 Didn't somebody think it was a good idea to tell me? 
 He didn't tell me. 
 I saw his hands shaking, so I asked Mom. 
 You know Dad. He doesn't like people to see any weakness, or... 
 Is it terminal? 
 Yeah. Stage three. 
 How long? 
 Six months to a year. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah. 
 Why do you think he wanted you to come home? 
 He...? 
 He what? 
 Yeah, he wanted you to come home so he can spend time with you, Laurel. 
 He said it was about working here. 
 Yeah, I mean, that's Dad. That's what he does. 
 He loves you. 
 [crying] 
 [sniffling] 
 [sighs] 
 Okay, let's review. 
 You tested this chemical on everyday Syrians, like these? 
 Yes. First corpses. 
 Then we needed live hosts. 
 And you watched heads explode? 
 I did. 
 I'm sorry to say. 
 Red : Hmm. 
 Um, is that all the testing you did? 
 No. We first started on zoo animals. 
 Red : You blew up the heads of zoo animals? 
 Yes. 
 Animals from the Syrian National Zoo. 
 Yeah. What... what kind of animals? 
 Uh... zebras, two giraffes and pandas. 
 Pandas? You-you blew up pandas like these? 
 Yes. 
 Like those. Just the heads. 
 Luke : Madam Chair, what is the relevance of this? 
 The relevance is that I care about what happens to pandas like these, don't you? 
 But... yes, but, uh, more importantly, I want to know if this witness is telling the truth. 
 Red : I'm sorry to see that my respected colleague has a greater regard for the truth than he does for the lives of pandas. 
 Luke : Madam Chair, I ask that we be given time to investigate this witness's claims. 
 May I finish my questions first? 
 Go on, Senator. 
 All right. 
 Ahmed, is this testing on zoo animals going on even as we speak? 
 Yes, right now. 
 They have a shipment of baby seals. 
 Red : And will they continue to blow up the heads of baby seals until we get boots on the ground in Syria? 
 Ahmed : Definitely. 
 ["You Might Think" by The Cars playing backwards] 
 What are you doing? 
 It's "You Might Think" played backwards. 
 Gustav is trying to see what works on him. 
 You can't just tie people up. 
 We need to call the police. 
 [shouting]: No, we need to figure out what the bugs want! 
 Laurel : He's denying he's infected, Right? 
 Yes, but he would. 
 So how are you gonna get him to talk? 
 Can we put on some better music? 
 Tell me what you know. 
 I'm gonna cut your fingers off if you don't tell me. 
 What do the bugs want?! Huh? 
 Hey, hey. 
 Laurel : Stop. Stop. 
 Rochelle : Okay... 
 I don't know what you're talking about. Please let me go. 
 You can't do this. 
 Why not? 
 He's not gonna talk to us unless we threaten him. 
 It's torture, Gustav. 
 Yeah. It's not like what happened with you. He's not human. 
 You don't know that. 
 You guys aren't getting it. 
 This is serious. 
 This could be the end of the world. 
 Let's just hold off for a while, okay? 
 Let's-let's wait and-and see if we can find out who he is. 
 There's one other thing. 
 I talked to my dad. 
 Is he infected? 
 No. 
 I don't... I don't know. 
 Is there any way Parkinson's could have made your machine give a false positive? 
 Gustav : Your dad has Parkinson's? 
 The reaction of the brain could be the same. It's possible. I don't know. 
 Did you test his balance, his-his hearing? 
 I did. But it could be Parkinson's related. 
 Is there any other way to know if he's infected? 
 Behavioral. 
 Has he given up drinking or... s*x? 
 You talking to your mother? 
 
 
 
 Woman :  The Jefferson Memorial, designed by John Russell Pope, honors our third president. 
 Though Pope's first design was chosen in 1925, construction began with a new design by Pope in 1938. 
 Thank you so much for such great questions. 
 This is the end of our tour, but I want you to know some important facts about the Jefferson Memorial. 
 The bronze statue, sculpted by Rudulph Evans, is 10,000 pounds and 19 feet tall. 
 And that's it. 
 Is Dean all right? 
 He's all right. 
 When's the last time you saw him? 
 Why? 
 Because I'm asking. 
 You never wanted anything to do with me, Laurel. 
 Because you're sleeping with my father. 
 I'm not judging you. 
 I'm just wondering why you're here. 
 You know my dad's ill? 
 I do. 
 He told you before he told me? 
 No. I guessed. 
 He had tremors. I told him to see a doctor. 
 I went with him to the doctor. 
 He called you in L.A. afterward to wish you a happy birthday. 
 That's why he called? I... 
 I thought he got the date wrong. 
 No. He wanted to hear your voice. 
 Has my dad's behavior changed the past few weeks? 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean, I'm worried his health has changed. 
 Has he s... stopped coming to you? 
 Coming? 
 Yes. 
 He says it's just temporary, he'll be back to his old self soon, but... 
 You don't want to hear this. 
 I don't, but I have to. 
 I suggested Viagra. 
 Thank you. 
 Laurel? 
 I wish we could talk sometime. 
 I love your father. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks.

 Terri, your mistress for the last 15 years. 
 What are you talking about?

 The one where you lie about Parkinson's, or having a mistress, or being infected? 
 Which one do you want to start with? 
 I stopped seeing that woman when I swore to your mom...

 Well, no. Not now. Not the past week. 
 Because you're infected. 
 We should talk. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You start. 
 Let me start by saying this: I understand where you're coming from. 
 You do? 
 Where am I coming from? 
 Fear of something different. 
 You mean a fear of my dad having bugs crawl into his head and eat his brain? 
 Half his brains. 
 Oh, my God.

 Look, I'm still here. 
 I'm still your dad. 
 I know about how you snuck out on your 13th birthday. 
 I know about that boy you slept with. 
 Okay, Dad. 
 I'm still looking at you as a father who loves his daughter. 
 But you're infected. 
 Okay. Let's take this step by step. 
 There are good parasites... 
 Oh, God. 
 Tell me that's not true. 
 Antibiotics are basically good parasites. 
 Look at that. 
 A week ago, I couldn't do that. 
 I was stage three, going on to stage four. 
 And now look at me. 
 I-I played racquetball yesterday. 
 Half your brain is missing, Dad. 
 And how much of that brain was I really using? 
 How much of Einstein's brain was he using? 
 No, Dad. You're not convincing me that this is a good thing. 
 Well, then let me convince you that it's an inevitable thing. 
 This is happening, honey. 
 And people are going to be better for it. 
 Is it from space? 
 Does it matter? 
 It matters to me. 
 Can't do anything with the information. 
 Well, then tell me. 
 There's a force outside of our petty concerns, and they want to help us. 
 By controlling us? 
 No. 
 More like living... beside us. 
 You can come back, Dad. 
 I did it. 
 You just need to battle it with the right side of your brain.

 Why do you want a war, Senator? 
 I don't want a war.

 Is war the only thing that would stop the Syrians in their tracks? 
 War or... 
 No. Just war. 
 Red : Okay. 
 Your witness, or whatever we say here. 
 Thank you, Senator. 
 Uh, Dr. Samira... 
 Is that your lab coat? 
 What? 
 The coat you're wearing... your lab coat, is it yours? 
 I, uh... no. 
 Healy : No. 
 Uh, who gave it to you? 
 Well, uh... [clears throat] 
 Red did. 
 I see. 
 Senator Wheatus. 
 And did he get it from a valet or...? 
 Come on, this is outrageous. 
 Where'd you get it, Red? 
 He is a doctor. 
 Why are you making fun of these terrible head explosions? 
 I'm not making fun of anything. 
 Isn't it true, Dr. Samira, that you've never even been in Syria? 
 Red : You are so dead set against confrontation... 
 All I'm looking for is the truth here. 
 Red : This is outrageous. 
 You will keep making up these lies... 
 We can start talking about... 
 [gavel pounding] - Okay! 
 Are you even a doctor? 
 That's enough. We're gonna take a break. 
 Thank you. 
 Senators Healy, Pollack and Wheatus, we need you to stay here for a second. 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 I have been given permission by my director in the foreign bureau to brief you on a few matters regarding Syria. 
 This is class four confidential, so you can't take notes... and you cannot repeat what is said here to anyone. 
 Before I continue, I need to know that you understand. 
 I understand. 
 I understand. 
 I understand. 
 I understand. 
 There is no chemical program in Syria. 
 There is no attempt to bring bioterrorism to the United States. 
 The witnesses you interviewed today and yesterday were frauds. 
 We can't say any more without revealing ongoing investigations, so this is only for this room. 
 But there is no reason, and I mean none, for suspecting Syria of state-sponsored terrorism. 
 Do you understand? 
 I do, yes. 
 I do. 
 I do. 
 Senator? 
 Oh, yeah. I get it. All's good here. 
 Good. 
 I'm sure you understand, but that's all I can say. 
 That's all I can ever say. 
 Yeah, I understand. 
 This is not healthy for me, you know? 
 [laughing] 
 It's not healthy for the bugs? 
 Oh, no, they don't care. They just want a well-run car. 
 Wouldn't you? Would you steal a car that needs oil? 
 So we're just cars to them? 
 You said that, I didn't. 
 No. 
 You said it. 
 The thing is, I don't like alcohol. 
 Are they from outer space, the bugs? 
 Yeah. Don't say "aliens." 
 They don't like the word "aliens." 
 What do they want here? 
 Oh, they just want a place to live. 
 They want a place to call home. 
 They live in us? 
 Yeah. 
 And what about the extremism? 
 Why are they making people more extreme? 
 'Cause that makes it harder for people to fight them. They're too busy fighting each other. 
 Republicans, Democrats. 
 Americans, Russians. 
 Why "You Might Think"? 
 What? 
 The song, "You Might Think"... why do you all like it? 
 Why not? It's a beautiful song. 
 Don't-don't you think it's beautiful? 
 No. I don't. 
 It is the most beautiful song ever written. 
 Yeah. 
 It sounds like your home planet? 
 What? Yeah. I guess it does. 
 I never thought of that. Yeah. 
 You want to dominate us, don't you? 
 You want to take us over? Is that it? 
 Come on. It's such an old-fashioned concept, who takes over who. 
 You're probably just as likely to overtake us. 
 What? 
 You said,  you're  likely to overtake us. 
 So? 
 Us. 
 You're a bug, and you're more bug than human. 
 You got me drinking. I don't know what I'm saying. 
 Laurel : Yes, you do. 
 You said "us." 
 My dad is a bug. 
 What the hell do you want? 
 [door closes] 
 You know what I want. 
 I have nothing in common with you. 
 You want welfare for the poor. 
 You want tax breaks for the rich. 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 Feel the Bern. 
 Always Trump. 
 Cute little queen. 
 You got a problem with that? 
 ♪ Soft Arabic music ♪ 
 Pollack : You know you want it. 
 Not as much as you. 
 Smell that. 
 You smell like a bitch. 
 A bitch you want. 
 You know you want it. 
 Pollack : Force me. 
 Here it comes. 
 Take it all. 
 [sucking sound] 
 [door closes] 
 So you can't help but infect others? 
 It's in our DNA, like yours. 
 We need to multiply. 
 Don't you? 
 Why is Red Wheatus so intent on this war with Syria? 
 Why not? 
 What, you want to occupy us in squabbles? 
 That would be nice. 
 If we're tied down in the Middle East, we won't have time to stop you from conquering us? 
 You know you're gonna have to let me go? 
 Why? 
 'Cause it's not in you to kill us. 
 I've squashed a bug on the floor before. 
 Yes. But I'm Kevin. 
 Look at my driver's license. 
 I have a sister and a family. 
 I like foreign films. 
 Have you seen  The Bicycle Thief? 
 No, you're just using the human side. 
 No. I'm here, too. 
 Hello. 
 See?  E necessario piantare I vostri semi in un altro campo. 
 That's a line from  The Bicycle Thief. 
 You know you're gonna have to let me go. 
 Thank you, Senator. 
 We just have a few quick questions. 
 Misty, this is a very troubling time, but, uh, I always have time for you. 
 Now, you were briefed by the CIA today, weren't you? 
 I can't speak to any specifics. 
 Everything's confidential, so... 
 Of course. We understand that, Senator, and we won't press you on it, but can you tell us what the CIA said? 
 Unfortunately, no, uh... but I can say this. 
 This... this briefing today... it stunned me. 
 In all my 20 years as a senator, I've never been so shocked as by what I heard today. 
 Luke : Son of a bitch! He can't do that! 
 He-he can't. 
 He-he didn't break confidentiality. 
 Oh, but he implied. 
 Yes, but what we heard was shocking. 
 We were all shocked. 
 You're kidding me? 
 We can't do anything. 
 We can contradict Red. 
 Not without breaking confidentiality. 
 Well, then we get Ella, and the three of us censure Red. 
 I don't think that'll work. 
 Why? 
 Ella :  Yes, I was stunned. 
 The CIA has asked us not to divulge any of the details, I must fulfill my duty. All I can say is that I was awestruck by what they said. Misty : And you are still pushing for a non-binding War Powers resolution? I am. This is what a baby seal looks like before its head is exploded. I can not let this happen. What are you doing? You won't regret this. Yes, I will, but I've been outvoted. ♪ Suspense ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ What's up? Close the door. I'm trying to figure out whether to leak. And I'm telling him not to. It'll hurt his presidential chances in 2020. Luke : Yeah, but Red is pushing us to war. He's suggesting something from a CIA briefing I know is not true. But the only way to prove it's not true is to leak, which he can't do. Unless it's the only way to stop a war. No. Either way, he can't leak a CIA briefing. Unless it's to stop a war. Okay, I need to think about this. Thanks. [door opens] Are you gonna fight me the whole way? What do you think?
