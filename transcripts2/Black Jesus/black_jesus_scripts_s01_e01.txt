 [Organ playing] 
 Senor Humberto. Now, you know you ain't got no business trippin' with that, man. 
 I got you, brah! 
 [chuckles] 
 [laughs] 
 Lloyd : Jesus! 
 [laughs] 
 [laughs] 
 All right, Jesus. What you got for me today? 
 I've been good! 
 It's all good to me, brother. 
 You know the world is your, man... whatever you want, man. 
 I need the numbers to the lotto. 
 The lotto numbers? Is that the best you can ask, man? 
 I mean, there's folks out here dying of famine and pestilence and you want the lotto numbers? 
 Come on, man. 
 You can do better that that. 
 What can you give me, then? 
 I got some kindness, I got compassion and I got love for all mankind. 
 You better get up on some of that, man. 
 Don't anybody want no sh1t like that! 
 Aw, man. Well [Bleep] y'all's stinky ass, then, man. 
 I don't stink, if I stank, I would smell myself. 
 Yes, you do stink. You smell like ass and crackers. 
 You got the nerve, walking around with all that brown on, lookin' like the UPS man... Nigga Wan Kenobi. Taliban, The Al-Qaeda. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 You look like you got a headful of barbeque Brillo pads, Mother [Bleep] 
 What? 
 Yeah, you, partner. 
 You can't insult me in my living room! 
 [Organ Plays Handel's "Hallelujah Chorus"] 
 [Bleep] you too, homeboy. 
 I still love your bitch ass. 
 By default, fool! 
 Fish : Oh, hell, no. Yo, yo, yo, big man. 
 Yo, somebody's in there. Hold on one second. 
 Hey, yo, G! 2-0's here, get up. 
 What's happenin'? 
 Hold on one second, sir. We'll get that moved for you. 
 Hey, Boonie, you and Jason come help me move Jesus' van across the street, man. 
 Nigga, right now. 
 You think I'm calling you now for you to move it later? 
 Hurry up. 
 All right, sir. 
 My boys will be here any minute. 
 Now if you'll just give me one second. 
 How's your day going so far? 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Look, there they go right there. 
 Hey, y'all, push it. 
 Come on. Push it, push it, push it, push it. 
 Getting it moved for you. 
 One second. 
 We're getting it moved for you, sir. 
 Come on, man. It's not even 8 [bleep] o'clock. 
 You trippin'. 
 8:20 
 Man, you know the [bleep] up part about it, besides this being the Mother [bleep] son of God?! 
 You out here writing these funky-ass $79 tickets for street cleaning, and look at this, man! 
 Street ain't even clean! 
 The least your fat ass can do is clean up some stuff! 
 Uncle Phil-lookin' Mother [bleep] 
 Uncle Phil? 
 "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" Nigga! 
 Hey, stall him out, Fish. 
 Stall him out, man, for he know not what the [bleep] he do, man. Look at this dude, man. 
 Come on, brah. Relax. 
 You feel me? 
 Eugene! 
 I ain't even mad at you, dawg. 
 It's just a job. 
 Matter of fact, I congratulate you, man, 'cause six days sober after 34 long years of hard-core drinking like you been doing... that's quite an accomplishment, man. 
 You know, that's some superb sh1t. 
 You feel me? 
 [laughs] 
 Hey, Eugene! 
 Go get you colon checked, pimp. 
 Boonie : Hey, man, check it out. 
 I stole this out of my mama's ashtray. 
 Now, that's all there is, so let's make it last. 
 Here. Light up. 
 [Lighter Clicking] 
 Mmm. Mmm! That's good stuff. 
 You gonna pass the joint? 
 I just got it, buddy. 
 I'll pass it to you in a second. 
 Mmm. 
 Man, pass the [Bleep] weed, man! 
 Damn! Can I hit some, man?! 
 I just got it! 
 I tell you, man, me and the boys were talking... and Nigga, you smoke all the [Bleep] weed. 
 Jason : Yeah, and I don't think you really factor in that somebody got to actually pay for this weed. 
 And who is that? 
 Me, Boonie, Fish. 
 Nigga, even Tray be frontin' you. 
 Well, what happened to us getting up off our ass and growing our own bud, though? 
 The Community Garden. 
 Instead, we're on some gansta sh1t all the Mother [Bleep] time. 
 We could be getting right out the mud ourselves, man. 
 Weed and vegetables... rutabagas, tomatoes, Spanish onions, artichokes. 
 Nigga, this is southwest Compton. 
 I ain't trying to be no God damn farmer I know where we at. 
 Man, we can't front you no more, dawg. 
 You really feel like get at me like that over a little funky-ass weed, though? 
 I mean, you do realize I died for your mother [Bleep] sins, right? 
 Oh, that sh1t getting old. 
 Homey, that's my life! 
 That was 2,014 years ago. 
 Yeah, that's old. 
 Hey, but sayin' check this out... we got this little lick we gonna hit across town, right? 
 Me, Jason, Boonie... we got a plan. 
 There you go with the schemes and plots. 
 Nigga, you not even listening! 
 Hey, man, it's solid, man. We're going to East L.A. to pick up a brick, and... check it out... my mom's paying. 
 Your mom's paying for it? 
 That income-tax check, you know what I'm saying? 
 So you know that's gonna by at least a pound. 
 Mm-hm. 
 She said all we need is a crew like three deep. 
 Now, I don't know these Nigga's, man, but they're highly recommended on Instagram. 
 Now, all you got to do is drive Boonie mama car, and you're gonna get a cut. 
 But if it's Boon Mom car, why I got to drive? 
 I mean, why you don't drive, dawg? 
 Hey, my mom said I can't go. 
 She don't want me on this run. 
 Plus my pit bull getting ready to have puppies. 
 I wasn't there when my kids were born, but I'm gonna be there for my bitch. 
 So, all you need me to do is drive the car and watch over y'all with God's good grace and that's it? 
 That's it. I mean, hit us with one of those miracles, in ca... in case we need it, which we won't, 'cause they legit. 
 They straight up. 
 Fish, man, you know I ain't in charge of miracles, man. 
 That's pops, man. 
 Just do what you do. 
 Aw, shoot. 
 [siren chirps] 
 Ooh. 
 Hey, baby. How ya doin? You lookin' good. 
 Really Jason, him again? 
 I thought we talked about getting high and hanging out with homeless dudes. 
 Come on, baby. 
 Don't do this in front of the homies. 
 Hi, Diane! 
 Girl, you hair is bangin'! 
 She got the Po-Po perm. 
 [laughter] 
 Is this what you call getting your life together, partying all the [Bleep] time? 
 Coming home for a little something, drunk, smelling like barbecue sauce? 
 She hit him with the smelling like barbecue sauce! 
 I don't want you hanging out with these bums. 
 Y punto. 
 Sue! Lisa! Is this wonderful basket of sh1t for me? 
 Wow, ladies! Somebody got love for their Lord and savior! 
 Ooh-hoo-hoo! 
 Come here, girl. 
 You know I love y'all like a [Bleep]. Come here. 
 Seriously... what is it with that guy? 
 You want a beer? Oh, I love y'all so much. 
 Baby, that's Jesus. 
 Yeah, man. 
 She sitting up there, talkin' 'bout she think we need a break. 
 I think she finally tired or my ass, man. 
 Don't even let it happen, dawg, 'cause God wants y'all to be together. 
 And on top of that, she's fine as Mnh! 
 That's about as good as you're gonna do, dawg. 
 God told you that? He told you He wants us to be together? 
 Nigga, she's an atheist cop. 
 Why would God care? 
 Heaven if I know. But what I'm sure of is the fact that she good people, man, and she care about you, brah. 
 And to be honest with you, J... 
 I am your Lord and savior. 
 I can be honest. 
 Yeah. 
 You need a boot up them cheeks one time, 'cause you be [Bleep] up, J, you ain't living up to your potential. 
 Plus, y'all got the little Black-Latin love going on, man. 
 L.A. really needs to see that sh1t right now, dawg. 
 Trayvon : You got Maggie on line 1. 
 What's happenin', Mag? Talk good to me, baby! 
 ♪ Come through 'cause we smokin, drinkin' and chillin' ♪ 
 [laughter] 
 Now, why you always got to act like that, man, when I ask you to do something? 
 But when you're down in the dumps, who do you call? Ain't nobody trippin' off what you got on, girl. It's the homies. We chillin'. 
 All right, fo' sure. Yeah. Hey Tray? 
 Yeah? 
 Mag, comin' through, so we're gonna need like two more six-packs of that hard apple cider, three boxes of blunts. A 20-pound bag of ice and you want something, dawg? 
 Yeah, some Vienna sausages. 
 Red or blue can? 
 Blue can. 
 Okay. So, nobody has any money for this, or... 
 You know what? I wanted to talk to you about that, man. 
 I'm glad you brought that up, 'cause, Tray, you know I love you, right? 
 Right. 
 You know I'll never forsake you, right? 
 Right. 
 Man, I got your best interests at heart, so I'm gonna need you to trust me on this, man. 
 You gots... you gots to complete this mission, man. Pay attention. You gots to complete this mission. 
 Okay. I'm just not sure how it works without any money. 
 Shh, shh, shh. All you need is the Holy Spirit. 
 That's it. 
 Okay. 
 Yo, Fish! What we rollin'? 
 What's happenin', pimps? [laughs] 
 Mags! It's about time you got your delinquent ass out here to function with the homies. What's happenin' with you? 
 Man, tell this grimy fool to let me come up on that pickup. 
 Hey, look, I'm only driving. I ain't got nothing to do with that. 
 Exactly. 
 Y'all ain't got nothin' to drink, man! What y'all sippin' on, man? 
 Oh, that's some bullshit. 
 Aw, man. What's up with this? Don't you know we like fine grapes? 
 [laughter] 
 Hey, that's what's up right there, man! Hey, hey hook me up there with some of that brown so I can lay these ugly bitches down. You dig? 
 Heavens, no! 
 Is this the only way I can get y'all attention, man. 
 Come through with a little yid-nac, little meat. Some big-booty women. 
 It helps. Nigga, pour up. 
 Naw, naw, man what happened to love and kindness, brah? 
 Man, why you got be like that? 
 You know what? I'm cool on y'all. I come through spreadin' the gospel all the time, man, but y'all ain't trying to hear you boy, though. 
 No, y'all ain't tryin' to hear me. 
 So, you know what? I don't even think I want to let y'all hit this fine yac. 
 'Cause you minds ain't ready and your hearts not open. 
 Hey. 
 [laughs] Hey, Vic! 
 What's happenin', man, you want some of this yac? 
 Vic : Told you niggas no barbecuing, didn't I? 
 I said it was unsanitary, right? Didn't I say no barbecuing? 
 How many times I got to keep telling y'all the same thing over and over till you get it through your blasphemous ass minds, huh? 
 Okay, settle down. I mean, ironically, the way you're speaking to Jesus is quite blasphemous [laughing] we're gonna be technical. 
 Ironically, I didn't slap the sh1t out of you soon as I got down here. 
 Who made you the Pope, huh? 
 Chill out, Vic, man. It's cool, man. We made enough for everybody, brah? 
 You want a plate? 
 Plate? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't want no goddamn plate. I want y'all to obey the rules, man. 
 There's no barbecuing! 
 What the [bleep] is your problem, Vic? 
 My problem is you need to find another place to be a bum at, homey! 
 This is my complex! I run this! It's my job! 
 No barbecuing! 
 Matter of fact, you know what I've been saying the same thing over and over to y'all niggas, y'all niggas don't know how to listen. 
 How many times I got to say the same thing over and over and over? 
 Check this out. 
 Hey, man! What you doing, brah?! 
 That's the end of that sh1t, ain't it? 
 That's some [bleep] up sh1t, Vic. 
 Know why it's [bleep] up? 
 Because the ants... got to eat. 
 What the [bleep] is this about? 
 Yeah, they like ribs, too. 
 Vic, the homies ain't even ate yet, man! What are you doing?! 
 Well, the homies ain't gonna eat. Homies don't work. See them ants? 
 They work hard all day long. Those is black ants. 
 They like chicken, watermelon, shrimp and ribs. 
 Now, you know that's a racist ass joke, Vic. 
 Wash your feet. 
 What? 
 You look like one of those niggas from Australia. 
 I swear to God, if I wasn't on parole... 
 Well, bless you too Vic! 
 If God didn't love you, he'd have made you girl looking exactly like you do. 
 You know, I'm all right for a dude, though. 
 Ooh, my! [laughs] 
 Looky here, looky here! Jesus! 
 [both laugh] 
 
 
 
 Oh my sweet lord. Mm-mm-mmm. 
 How you doin'? 
 Too blessed to be stressed, baby. 
 [both laugh] 
 Hey, Mama, hey. 
 Come on in. 
 Ooo, Ms. Tudi, I'm feeling what you done with this spot! 
 You like it? 
 Yes, and these chandeliers is wet! 
 Chechnyan crystal, baby. 
 And Jesus, none of this... oh hallelujah... would have been possible with.. 
 Oh, my bad, Ms. Tudi. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I made these for you.. chocolate, mint, pistachio with a dash of sea salt. 
 That's my favorite. 
 All right! 
 Those are for Jesus, fat ass. 
 Jesus, can I get you some tea? 
 Oh, yes, please, Ms. Tudi? 
 All right. 
 Hey, man, give me a cookie, man. 
 Naw, man. 
 I prayed for the cookie, man. 
 I said no cookie, Boonie! Sit your fat ass down! 
 Sit down. 
 Jesus, you're still gonna be able to do that thing for me later, right? 
 That pickup? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh, Ms. Tudi, real "G" like you in these streets don't need no problem gettin' no weed, though. 
 Well, but, Jesus, my clientele... 
 Yoga bitch you... 
 My clientele, nigga... come to me for the best weed... and I hear these guys got the best weed. 
 Then why Boonie can't go? 
 'Cause he bad luck... that's why! 
 Fine. I don't want to go. 
 Oh, I know you didn't. 'Cause you're lazy. 
 You're a fat, bad-luck-having lazy nigga like your father. 
 Ms. Tudi, you know, you really be going to hard on that boy. 
 Oh, you think I'm hard on him? 
 This is a Romanian Ultrasuede Llama-skin sofa. 
 That's nice! 
 Yeah, with an ass-sized crater in it. 
 Is that what that is? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I thought it was part of the design. 
 No, that's his ass crack. 
 Damn, Boonie! 
 Now, listen Jesus... 
 You d... tsk! 
 Mmm. Now, Jesus, you're the only one I trust with my money and my car. 
 [sighs] 
 ♪ Workin', workin', workin ♪ 
 What's that? 
 Fish, is that a firearm?! 
 Technically, this is a homemade marble-shooting pistol. Not a firearm. 
 So, legally, I can't catch a gun case for this. 
 But it'll light somebody ass up. 
 Man, I thought you said these dudes was cool, man. 
 You know I don't like guns, man. 
 Oh, yeah, they cool, but now we cool, too! 
 I already told you they come highly recommended online. 
 They got 1,500 followers. 
 What's up with that mask, Maggs? 
 What you guys didn't bring masks? 
 Hell, no. 
 We're gonna do some janky sh1t. When you're doing janky sh1t, you wear a mask! 
 Surprise, mother [bleep] get your bitch ass out the car. Now... come on! 
 Get your ass out the car! 
 Get your ass up against the wall! 
 Hurry up! Go! 
 Get your ass up against the wall! 
 You look like you're praying too, spring break bitch. 
 Get your hands up against the wall! 
 Hey, hey, do you gentleman consent to a quick search? 
 Yes, sir! 
 And the bitch, too. 
 Where the money at? 
 Give me that jacket. Give me that jacket. 
 Take it off! Oh it looks like 2 G's. Thanks for paying in advance. 
 Pleasure doing business with you bitches. 
 Damn! We got set up, man!

 We're cool. 
 Take the masks off, all y'all! 
 Hey, it's white boys! 
 White boys! 
 With some fake-ass guns. 
 Michael, Chandler, Ross... 
 I am so disappointed in all you! 
 Do you know how mad your mother would be if she found out you was out here doing gansta-shit instead of at water polo lessons? 
 Huh! 
 Are y'all familiar with the wrath of God! 
 Where the money at?! 
 Where the weed at? 
 Cough up the money. 
 Where the weed? 
 The weed's in the trunk! 
 Hey, we got the Boonie mama money. 
 Right there, right there.

 You want to be a thug?! 
 How 'bout a [bleep] marble to your temple, boy! 
 Huh! 
 Marble? 
 Shut the [bleep] up! 
 Ross, Chandler, Michael... 
 Man, I swear to pops I want to put my holy hand down on y'all. 
 But you know what? I'm not, 'cause I'll forgive you. 
 Look at you, man. Calm down. Look at him. 
 He's just cute, like a little smurf, huh? 
 Come on. Let's bust a move, Fish. 
 Come on, Fish! 
 Come on, Fish! 
 Jesus, your robe! 
 Shoot! 
 [tires screech] 
 Yeah, we got about an elbow of that good white-boy weed and all of Boonie's Mama money. 
 We won! 
 Where the [bleep] is the money? 
 I went on and let the white boys have it. 
 You did what? 
 Nigga, you magically went in my pockets and gave the white boys the [bleep] money? 
 That's a God damn miracle in reverse, man! 
 [siren wails] 
 Show me those hands! 
 There you go. 
 Out of the car... now! 
 No, it's cool we don't need your help, Officer... we're good here. 
 We're straight, man. Come on, man.
