 [water dripping] 
 -[stone door scraping open] 
 -[whimpering] 
 -[flames whoosh] 
 -[whimpers] 
 [chains clank] 
 -[male shouts] 
 [gasps] 
 [whimpering] 
 [PRIESTESS] I want to be an adventurer. 
 -[WOMAN] Good morning! 
 -[MAN] Everyone off your horses. 
 (villagers chattering)  
  [GUILD GIRL] And do you know how to read and write? 
 I do. 
 Those were skills taught at the temple. 
 Perfect. 
 Then please fill this form out for me. 
 [MAN] How'd it go with that manticore at the pass? 
 [WOMAN] Eh, you know, it wasn't too bad. 
 [MAN 2] I hear the capital's the place to go     
 if you're lookin' to make some coin. 
 Apparently, a demon lord showed up. 
 [MAN 3] How strong are we talkin'? 
 Figure I could handle a low-level one myself. 
 [laughter] 
 Okay, you're 15 years old. 
 And it says you've trained to be a priestess? 
 That's right. 
 And now that I'm an adult,  I want to become an adventurer  and help out as many people as I can. 
 Here. 
 This will serve as your guild identification. 
 Now, there are ten ranks for adventurers. 
 Platinum is the highest rank, following that is gold. 
 However, the highest-ranked people you'll encounter  out in the field are the silvers. 
 If you'll look at your tag,  you'll see it indicates that you're a porcelain,  which is the lowest-ranked among our adventurers. 
 This tells people that I'm a beginner? 
 Correct, and should anything go wrong on a quest,  it can also be a means of identifying you. 
 -Hold on to it. 
 -Right! 
 Well, that's it for your registration. 
 This board is where quests are posted. 
 You're welcome to look through them  for one that's suitable for your rank. 
 Another option would be joining  -a veteran adventurer's party-- -Hey. 
 We're gonna go on a quest, do you wanna come with? 
 Yeah, she said you're a priestess, right? 
 My adventuring party's missing a healer,  but we've got an urgent quest to tackle  and are looking to add somebody with the right skills  and training as soon as possible. 
 Will you come along with us? 
 I don't know. 
 What kind of quest is it? 
 Goblin slaying! 
 You're gonna go after goblins? 
 Sure are. 
 They attacked a village,  and as if stealing supplies and livestock weren't bad enough,  they kidnapped a few of the local girls too. 
 We need to rescue them as soon as we can. 
 [GUILD GIRL] Um, you're all porcelain-ranked, aren't you? 
 This'll be quite the challenge. 
 I'm sure if you wait,  there will be other adventurers willing to take on the quest. 
 Oh, please. 
 The four of us can handle  a bunch of filthy goblins, no problem. 
 -Can't we? 
 -Mm-hmm. 
 You in, Priestess? 
 Come on and make up your mind already. 
 Okay, I'll go with you,  if you really think I'll be able to help. 
 All right! 
 We can finally go on an adventure! 
 -Welcome aboard! 
 -Yeah! 
 Great to have you! 
 [laughter] 
 [WARRIOR] Those goblins don't stand a chance now! 
 [WIZARD] Don't get too excited. 
 [FIGHTER] If things start to get ugly, just leave it to me. 
 [crows cawing] 
 Oh. 
 Uh... 
 [chuckles nervously] 
 Oh... 
 Mm. 
 [crows cawing] 
 Um, is this a good idea? 
 I mean, just barging in? 
 Maybe we should head back outside and plan some more. 
 Really? 
 Now's when you decide to back out of this? 
 [laughs] 
 You don't need to worry about anything. 
 Goblins are nothing. 
 They're the size of little children and just as stupid. 
 They're basically the weakest monster you can fight. 
 I even kicked a couple out of my village once, all by myself. 
 I wouldn't be bragging about that if I were you. 
 [WARRIOR] Ha! 
 I'm sure we'll be able to handle anything,  and after this quest we're going to go kill a dragon! 
 [WIZARD] You're getting ahead of yourself. 
 But, yeah, we'll eventually get there. 
 One day, I'm gonna be a famous dragon slayer! 
 -[grunting] 
 -[laughing] 
 Even if that idiot can't cut them all down,  I'll kill them with my bare hands. 
 I've got you covered. 
 Besides, she's a wizard who graduated  from the Sages's Academy in the capital. 
 -[PRIESTESS gasps] 
 -Hmm? 
 [harrumphs] 
 [WARRIOR] Okay. 
 Less talking, more exploring. 
 Let's go. 
 Did any of you bring potions along just in case? 
 -[WARRIOR] Nope. 
 -Huh? 
 We didn't have the time or the money  to do much shopping before we left. 
 Rescuing those kidnapped girls takes priority. 
 Plus, we've got you to help. 
 You can heal us if we happen to get hurt, right? 
 Well, I can pray to the goddess  and ask for the miracles of healing and light if need be,  but there are limits. 
 I can only use them three times, so... 
 -Hold up! 
 -Huh? 
 [WARRIOR] What the heck is this? 
 [FIGHTER] There was one at the entrance, too. 
 [WARRIOR] I know. 
 Hear me, oh merciful Earth Mother. 
 Please offer us your loving protection. 
 -Light the darkness. 
 -Come on, we're falling behind. 
 The other two ran up ahead and I don't want to miss anything. 
 Right, I'm sorry. 
 [panting] 
 [distant clatter] 
 Jeez, what's the matter now? 
 It's just, I thought I heard something. 
 [WIZARD] Like what? 
 I'm not sure, but it was behind us. 
 That's impossible, we just came from the entrance  and didn't see anyone along the way. 
 It's probably only your imagination. 
 -[clatters] 
 -Huh? 
 -[growling] 
 -[gasping] 
 The goblins! 
 [goblins growling] 
 [whimpering] 
 -Huh? 
 -[growling] 
 Sagitta inflammarae... 
 radius! 
 -[growls] 
 -[gasps] 
 -Firebolt! 
 -[goblin screams] 
 Hey, I got one! 
 Sagitta inflammarae radius! 
 -[growling] 
 -[whimpering] 
 No, don't! 
 Give that back! 
 -[growls] 
 -[gasps] 
 [growls] 
 -[grunting] 
 -[growling] 
 Get away from her, monsters! 
 [groans] 
 [screaming] 
 [WARRIOR grunts] 
 [yelling] 
 How dare you hurt her! 
 You're dead! 
 -Get over here! 
 -[whimpering] 
 [grunts] 
 Take that! 
 Hurry and perform a healing miracle. 
 Of course! 
 Hear me, oh merciful Earth Mother. 
 Please lay your blessed hands upon this child's wounds! 
 Heal her! 
 [grunting] 
 Monsters! 
 I'll kill you all! 
 Stop swinging that thing around. 
 I can't get close! 
 You stay back there and protect the rest of our group. 
 I'll take care of these bastards! 
 What's the matter, you scared? 
 [screaming] 
 [yelling] 
 [grunting] 
 Die! 
 -[growling] 
 -Huh? 
 You're the next one down!

 [WARRIOR screaming] 
 -[whimpers] 
 -[squelching] 
 -[WARRIOR screaming] 
 -[gasping] 
 I don't understand. 
 I used healing on her, but she's not getting better. 
 Take her and get out of here. 
 -But what about you? 
 -I can still fight! 
 [grunts] 
 [gasps, growls]

 Go. 
 Take her. 
 Just forget about me and run. 
 [goblin grunts] 
 [cackling] 
 -[gasps] 
 -[whimpers] 
 [FIGHTER screaming] 
 [screaming continuing] 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 -[staff clatters] 
 -[PRIESTESS gasps] 
 Forgive me! 
 Are you okay? 
 [groans, gags] 
 Why didn't you get better?

 Goblin Slayer? 
 [gasps] 
 Huh? 
 -Silver. 
 -Are you a rookie? 
 Yes. 
 I am. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] You can still talk. 
 Good sign. 
 [whimpers] 
 [screaming] 
 Drink this. 
 It will help with the pain. 
 Thanks, but... 
 she needs it much more. 
 [gagging] 
 -[GOBLIN SLAYER] No point. 
 -[gasps] 
 Huh? 
 -She's poisoned. 
 -Aren't you too? 
 I have an antidote, but it's too late for her.

 me.

 We might've been able to get her out of here and save her! 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] She would have suffered more. 
 Drink. 
 [gulps] 
 [coughs] 
 [gasps] 
 
 
 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Is there a big one with them? 
 Yes, I think I saw one. 
 -He was strong. 
 -That was a hobgoblin. 
 They must have recruited one as a guard. 
 I'm going to kill this horde. 
 -What will you do? 
 -I'll go, too. 
 With you. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Do you know spells? 
 I can perform the miracles of Healing and Holy Light. 
 -How often? 
 -Only three times. 
 So, I can cast two more spells in here. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] All right. 
 [squelching] 
 [whimpers] 
 Huh? 
 What are you doing to him? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] We have to get rid of our scents. 
 [gasps] 
 -Get used to the smell of blood. 
 -I'll try. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Eight, nine.

 [GOBLIN SLAYER] This is too long to swing in a cave. 
 ♪  I don't get it. 
 How did this happen? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Let me guess. 
 They attacked you from behind. 
 That's right. 
 [gasps] 
 But earlier,  how did we miss this when we walked by? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] It's a dark cave. 
 If all you have is a torch,  this entrance would just look like a shadow on the wall. 
 And that's what you were looking at. 
 ♪  [GOBLIN SLAYER] 
 It's a common mistake for rookies. 
 ♪  [GOBLIN SLAYER] 
 These creatures, they're not bright,  but they're not fools, either. 
 And this horde is being led by a shaman. 
 -[PRIESTESS] A shaman? 
 -A powerful spell-caster. 
 -How many of you came here? 
 -There were four of us. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] The last one must be a woman. 
 Looks like they dragged her in deeper. 
 We have to go save her! 
 [clattering] 
 [goblins growling] 
 [goblin grunts] 
 [grunts] 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Ten. 
 Do you have an ability that lets you see in the darkness? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Of course not. 
 I've just practiced. 
 The trick is to aim where their necks should be. 
 That's insane. 
 How much have you trained? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] A lot. 
 You're leaving the sword? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] There's too much blood on it. 
 That was a scout. 
 We should go this way. 
 -Follow me. 
 -Right. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Use Holy Light from here. 
 Once you're done, run back towards the entrance. 
 -Okay. 
 -[growls] 
 Do it! 
 ♪  [breathes deeply] 
 Hear me, oh merciful Earth Mother. 
 Protect us and bless us with Holy Light!

 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Eleven. 
 [hobgoblin screams] 
 There will be others coming for us,  but I'm all out of spells. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] I know. 
 [goblins growling] 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] See ya. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Twelve. 
 Thirteen. 
 [goblins screaming] 
 [coughs] 
 What was that? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Gasoline I bought from an alchemist. 
 Wasn't very effective for what I paid. 
 But the girls, what if they get burned too? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] There were only three goblin corpses,  the flames won't spread too far. 
 -They'll be fine. 
 -Are you going in there again? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] No. 
 [goblins growling] 
 -[squelching] 
 -They probably think we ran. 
 They'll have no idea I'm waiting out here for them. 
 [growling] 
 [foosteps echoing] 
 [gasps] 
 [breath shuddering] 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 It's safe. 
 They won't hurt you again. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Shaman. 
 -You can't fool me. 
 -[roars] 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Eighteen. 
 These high-level ones are tough. 
 [debris clattering] 
 [PRIESTESS] A secret door? 
 [crying, whimpering voices] 
 -[PRIESTESS] Children. 
 -They multiply quickly. 
 If this nest had been left much longer,  there might've been a horde of 50 waiting for us down here. 
 We were lucky. 
 -Are you going to kill them? 
 -Of course I am. 
 These animals hold on to grudges for life. 
 The survivors in the nest  would learn from the mistakes of the dead and adapt. 
 There isn't a single reason to show them mercy. 
 But what if there was a good goblin? 
 -They might exist. 
 -[GOBLIN SLAYER] Maybe. 
 If you looked hard, you might be able to find one. 
 But in the end, the only good goblins  are the ones who never show their faces to the light of day. 
 [goblin children screaming] 
 [PRIESTESS sobbing] 
 [screaming continuing] 
 [screaming fades] 
 [PRIESTESS crying] 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] That makes 22. 
 [crying continuing] 
 ♪  [PRIESTESS] 
 Apparently, this is a common occurrence. 
 A goblin horde attacks a village and kidnaps any girls they find. 
 Rookie adventurers think slaying them will be an easy quest,  only to end up being slaughtered themselves. 
 If the girls are rescued,  they're traumatized from being treated as playthings,  and usually end up joining temples. 
 Sometimes an adventurer survives,  but gives up the life. 
 Just disappears. 
 Tragedies like this happen all too often in this harsh world. 
 But does it really have to be this way? 
 I don't know the answer. 
 In the end, there are only two things I'm certain of. 
 [doors creak] 
 The first is that, despite what happened,  I'm still an adventurer. 
 And the second... 
 [gasps] 
 It's good to see you, Goblin Slayer. 
 Um, I went and bought some armor like you told me to. 
 It's chain mail. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] That'll work. 
 Are you taking a quest? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] I'm killing goblins. 
 Are you coming? 
 Yes! 
 [rocks clattering]
