 Dude, the bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school. 
 Yeah, this is, like, the third day in a row. 
 I wonder what's wrong. 
 [muffled speech] 
 [laughter] 
 Yeah. Hey, maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
 [brakes hiss] 
 Come on, we're running late! 
 We're not getting on, you fat, ugly bitch. 
 What did you say? I said, "We're not getting on, you fat, ugly bitch." 
 Oh, all right, then. 
 [engine revs] 
 Whoa, dude. I always wondered if that would work. 
 [doorbell dings] 
 Hello, boys. Hi, we were wondering why fat-ass, I mean, Cartman hasn't been showing up for school. Oh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard. 
 In the backyard? Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants? 
 [in Polly's voice] Yes, Eric, I would love some tea, thank you. 
 [normal voice] You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.

 Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?

 No, dude, this looks really serious. 
 I think we better get help. Really? 
 [in Peter Panda's voice] Wow, Eric, you are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea. 
 [normal voice] Why, thank you, Peter Panda. 
 It's a distinctive Earl Grey. 
 [in Polly's voice] Eric is the best. 
 [in Clyde's voice] Hooray for Eric! 
 [in Peter Panda's voice] Eric kicks ass. 
 Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman. 
 Oh, well, there's a newsflash. 
 No, no, we saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals. 
 Yeah, he was doing their voices and pouring tea for them. Oh, okay. 
 Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, M'kay? What do you mean? 
 Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric? No. 
 Well, obviously, something is bothering him, M'kay? 
 Oh, of course, my video camera. 
 Boys, if you could video tape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, M'kay? Is that legal? 
 Oh, hell yes. My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants. 
 [in Polly's voice] Oh, thank you, Eric. 
 You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and cool. 
 [in Peter Panda's voice] Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and cool... Everybody likes you very much. 
 [in normal voice] That's nice, Peter Panda. 
 Dude, this is gonna be the funniest tape ever made.

 Uh-huh. And my friend Kyle has a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad? 
 Yes. 
 Well, what's your question, hun? 
 God damn it, do I have a dad? 
 Oh. I wanna know where I came from. Oh, hmm, well, you see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are attracted to each other, they want to be close to each other. 
 Uh-huh. And sometimes, the man puts his hoo-hoo-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 
 So who put his hoo-hoo-dilly in your cha-cha? 
 Eric, the day I met your father, it was like magic. 
 It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning at the 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance. 
 [twangy music] 
 [glass shattering] 
 [overlapping chatter] 
 I was young and naive then. 
 Wow, I've never seen a woman drink that much. 
 You're amazing, Ms. Cartman. 
 Oh, heck, I haven't even started yet. 
 [laughs] I baked cookies. 
 Would anybody like one? I wouldn't mind getting ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman. 
 Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady. 
 Mm, that's a good cookie!

 So where's Chief Running Wa... I mean, Dad, now? 
 Oh, I never saw him after that. 
 I wasn't really that interested in him. 
 That isn't a very romantic story, Mom. 
 I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town. 
 Wow, to think all this time I'm actually a naive American. 
 [meows] No, kitty, that's a bad kitty!

 [laughs] This guy sucks. 
 [doorbell dings] Yeah, he's almost as bad as that guy on "Full House."

 What the hell are doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace? 
 Naive American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. What? 
 [laughter] 
 Hey, the white man has mocked my people long enough. 
 You keep your goddamn mouth shut. 
 Stan, I need to borrow your bike to ride over to the reservation. What are you talking about, Cartman? Why name isn't Eric Cartman. 
 It's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it? 
 Go ahead, dude. 
 Man, Cartman's more screwed up than I thought. 
 Yeah, we better get this video tape over to Mr. Mackey quick. 
 Just a friendly reminder to all of you out there. 
 Send us your stupidest home videos.

 Your mother? Liane Cartman. 
 Cartman, oh, boy, I was worried there for a second. 
 Look, kid, I'm not your father. 
 But my mom says you were the guy she was with. 
 Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as 
 "bear with wide canyon." What do you mean? 
 She is "doe who cannot keep legs together." 
 Huh? Your mom's a slut. 
 Hey! Don't feel too bad.

 Did you send the video tape to "America's Stupidest Home Videos?" 
 Yeah, I mailed it last night. 
 What sucks is that now, I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won. 
 If we win, we can buy a new go-kart that actually runs. 
 Shh, here comes Cartman. 
 Sup, homies? Cartman? 
 I was just down in the SPC kicking it with some Gs on the west side. 
 You live on the east side, Cartman.

 Wait, wait, I know a way to find out. 
 How? At my laboratory. 
 We can do DNA genetic testing.

 Really? You can? 
 Yes, of course. I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny, but... 
 How much? $3,000 should cover it. 
 I don't have $3,000. Oh, never mind.

 Oh, nothing. It's just nothing. 
 Come on, what's the matter, Cartman? 
 Well, I wanted to know who my dad is, but, to find out, they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3,000, and I don't have $3,000. 
 Wow, we're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.

 Thanks, you guys. Uh, yeah. 
 And now back to "America's Stupidest Home Videos." 
 What kind of video did you guys make? 
 Uh, you'll see. 
 Well, it's time to crown the $10,000 winner. 
 Our judges have narrowed it down to only three videos. 
 First, it's "Dog Who Puts Hat on Master's Head." 
 Oh, I'm a little dog. I'm just a little dog. 
 Oh, but I've gotta put a hat on my master's head.

 Boy, looks like this kid needs some therapy. 
 We're sure to win, Cartman. 
 Then you get your DNA money. I am so pissed off right now. They laughed hardest at our video... we're gonna win. We're gonna win. 
 And finally, our third contestant, "Young Child Gets Hit by a Train." 
 Oh, I'm such a cute little kid. 
 Hmm, I wonder if I can get this go-kart started. 
 [engine spluttering] 
 [vrooming] 
 Oh, I hope I don't get hit by a train.

 [laughter] 
 Dude, we lost! Damn it! 
 I am going to [bleep] kill you guys, seriously. 
 Stand up and take a bow, Mr. Marsh. 
 I won, I won! Grandpa! 
 Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3,000 runner-up prizes. 
 Well, see you next time. 
 Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3,000. 
 That's enough for you to do your DNA tests, Kill you guys. 
 Kill you guys. 
 [thunder crashes] 
 All right, from everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father to the people in this room. 
 Officer Barbrady, Chef, Jimbo, Mr. Garrison, Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski, myself, my friend, Kevin, or the 1989 Denver Broncos. 
 Wow, I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but goddamn! The test results are in the envelope. Shall I open it? 
 Yes, for God's sake, get on with it! 
 [mumbling] [gasps] 
 The father of Eric Cartman is indeed someone in this room. 
 The father is... narrator: Who is Eric Cartman's father? 
 Is it Chief Running Water, or is it Chef? 
 Is it Mephesto? 
 Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? 
 Or is it Mr. Garrison? 
 No, he's gay. You go to hell! 
 You go to hell, and you die! 
 Narrator: Is it Jimbo? Ah! 
 Narrator: Or is it Officer Barbrady? 
 Huh, where? 
 Narrator: Or could it be Ned? Could be. 
 Narrator: Or Mr. Broflovski? 
 Dad, how could you? 
 Narrator: Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? 
 The answer is coming on an all-new "South Park" in just four weeks. 
 What? 
 Son of a bitch.
