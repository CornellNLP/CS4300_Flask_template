 Now, blow out the candles, Grandpa. 
 [wheezing] 
 All: Hooray! 
 How's it feel to be 102, Paps? 
 Shoot me! Make a wish, Grandpa. 
 I wish I were dead! 
 [laughs] That's our silly Grandpa. 
 I'm not being silly, kill me! 
 I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old! 
 Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake? 
 Me. I will! 
 It's 8:00. My favorite TV show is on. 
 That show's for babies. 
 It's so stupid! 
 Can I eat my cake in the living room, Mom? 
 Please, can I? 
 Oh, all right. 
 But take your Grampy with you. 
 Ah, damn it! Language! 
 And now back to "Terrance and Phillip." 
 Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. 
 Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 
 [both fart, laugh] 
 [moans] 
 [gunshot] Ah, damn it! 
 How would you like to make a dollar, Billy? 
 My name's not Billy, Grandpa, it's Stan. 
 Damn it, Billy, do you want a dollar or don't you? 
 Sure. Okay. 
 You just have to do one thing for me. 
 I'm not gonna kill you, Grandpa. 
 Why not? 'Cause I'll get in trouble. 
 I killed my grandpa when I was your age! 
 Leave me alone, Grandpa. 
 [both fart, laugh] 
 What has America's youth come to? 
 Kids won't even kill their own grandparents! 
 ♪ ♪  
 Hey, Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 
 [farts] 
 Oh! You farted! 
 [laughs] 
 Kyle, bubby, what are you watching? 
 Hey, Phillip, would you like a flower? 
 I sure would, Terrance. 
 All righty, then, here's a tulip. 
 [farts] 
 What is this? It's horrible! 
 Dude, it's "Terrance and Phillip." 
 Take that, you stupid dick. 
 What did he say? 
 You're an asshole, Phillip. 
 Wh-wh-what?! [both laugh] 
 Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore. 
 It's immature toilet humor. 
 But everybody watches "Terrance and Phillip." 
 Oh, really? Is that so? 
 Oh, no, Phillip, looks like you're about to fart. 
 You're exactly right, Terrance. 
 [farts] 
 Oh, no! 
 [laughs] Sweet. 
 Eric, dear, I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. 
 She said that this show is naughty and might make you a potty mouth. 
 That's a bunch of crap! 
 Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew! 
 Oh. Okay, hon. 
 I'm not going to kill you, Grandpa! 
 Ingrate! 
 Good night, Grandpa! 
 You pompous son of a whore! 
 ♪ ♪  
 Ow! What the hell was that for? 
 That's for your stupid mother! 
 She made me miss "Terrance and Phillip" last night. 
 Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night? 
 Well, I didn't have her do it. 
 She did it on her own. 
 Why does this happen every month? 
 It seems like right about the same time every month Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it. 
 Children, children, a certain student's mother called me last night. 
 Ah, gee, I wonder whose mother that could've been. 
 She informed me that some of you might be watching a naughty show called "Terrance and Phillip." [all giggling] 
 Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison. 
 That's right, Mr. Hat. 
 Shows like "Terrance and Phillip" are what we call "toilet humor." 
 They don't expand your minds. 
 You see, children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash. 
 Kenny, why are you late to class? 
 Oh, okay, Kenny, be seated. 
 Now, as I was saying, the reason the parents of South Park are so upset is because... 
 Yes, Kenny, what is it? [mumbling] 
 I thought you just came from the bathroom. 
 [mumbles loudly] 
 Okay, okay, go ahead. 
 As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy the show even though it isn't based in reality. 
 There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. [loud diarrhea sounds] 
 And throughout history, there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. 
 You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your mind with more intelligent entertainment. 
 Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny! Pay attention, children! 
 I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch "Terrance and Phillip" anymore ever. 
 What? 
 Not watch "Terrance and Phillip" ever? 
 That's right, children. 
 Are there any questions? Yes, Stanley? 
 Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to? 
 Wh-what do you mean? 
 My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should. 
 Well, then, you should... I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna. Really? 
 Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Laborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get into any trouble at all. 
 Wow! Hey! 
 Maybe we can get him to kill Kyle's mom! 
 So is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison? 
 Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a 20-foot pole. 
 [mumbles loudly] 
 [diarrhea sounds] 
 [Kenny yells] 
 Man, I can't believe we're gonna miss 
 "Terrance and Phillip" today. 
 I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
 [moaning] 
 Don't worry, dude, we can all go watch it at my house. 
 My parents don't get home until late. 
 But won't your grandpa be there? 
 Yeah. Just kill him, dude. 
 Maybe he'll give you some money. 
 Hello there, children. Hey, Chef. 
 How's it going? Bad. 
 Why bad? 
 Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa? 
 You can't kill my grandpa, Stan. 
 He's already passed on. No, I mean kill my grandpa. 
 No, I don't think that's okay, Stan. 
 In fact, I think that's illegal. 
 See, I told you, dude. 
 Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die 
 'cause he's really old and he's just asking for help? 
 Yeah, like assisted suicide, what about that? 
 I don't want to touch that with a 40-foot pole. 
 What's the big deal? 
 Why won't anybody talk about this? 
 And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. 
 I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 
 Hey, Phillip, guess what? What? 
 Fart. [farts] 
 Now, apparently, that's supposed to be funny. 
 [laughs] He farted right on his head. 
 Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. 
 We need to boycott the entire network! 
 All those in favor?

 Oh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. 
 I've got the green apple splatters. 
 [all laughing] Heh, green apple splatters.

 Hi, Grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV if that's okay. 
 Billy, help Grandpa stick this fork in the outlet! 
 No, Grandpa, I'll get in trouble. 
 Kill me, God damn it! 
 No, I can't even kill a deer. 
 Well, then, have one of your little friends do it. 
 You can kill me, can't you? 
 I would never kill somebody. 
 Not unless they pissed me off. 
 Oh, is that a fact? 
 Well, let me tell you something, porky, your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch. 
 What? That's right. 
 Grandpa! 
 And then I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton and had my way with her too. Hey! 
 Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma. 
 You piece of crap, I'll kill you! 
 That's the spirit, tubby! 
 C'mon, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you. 
 Don't talk about my mom like that! 
 We can go watch "Terrance and Phillip" in the kitchen. 
 I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, fatso? 
 Ah! I can't believe that son of a bitch! 
 Here, Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes. 
 Ooh, Snacky Cakes? Good deal. 
 I don't know what to do, dude. 
 My grandpa really wants to die. 
 I'm telling you, it's okay. 
 Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance. 
 Hey, yeah. 
 And now back to "Jesus and Pals" 
 On South Park public access. 
 Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace. 
 First caller, you're on "Jesus and Pals." 
 Yeah, is this Jesus? [feedback whines] 
 Yes, caller, you need to turn your TV down. 
 That's why you're getting that weird feedback. 
 Oh, sorry. This is Martin. 
 Martin from Aspen Park, yes, I know. 
 How the hell'd you know that? 
 Well, maybe because I'm the son of God, brainiac. 
 Now, do you have a question? 
 Uh, yeah, I have this cousin who cheated on the SATs... 
 Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong no matter what the circumstance. 
 Oh. Okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus. 
 Next caller, you're on the air. 
 Jesus? Yes, my son? 
 Jesus, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like assisted suicide, is that okay? 
 My son... Yes? 
 I'm not touching that with a 60-foot pole. 
 Next caller. 
 God damn it! I heard that. 
 What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
 Hey, you guys! 
 "Terrance and Phillip" is on! Yeah! 
 Hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it? 
 Kyle, don't be such a butthole. 
 Yeah, just 'cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer. 
 Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman! 
 A. Bitch. 
 Your mom is a b-b-b-bitch. 
 And now back to "Terrance and Phillip." 
 Hey, Phillip, would you like to eat some beans? 
 Oh, yeah, I love beans! 
 Uh-oh, I bet I know what's coming. 
 Billy, would you mind holding this for Grandpa, please? 
 Okay, Grandpa, okay, just, get out of the way of the TV. 
 Hey, Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart. 
 Well, don't fart on me, Terrance. 
 Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again!

 Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny!

 Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? 
 What changed you into such demonic little bastards? 
 We didn't know what we were doing. 
 We were just sitting there watching 
 "Terrance and Phillip," and...

 So it is that show that is to blame. 
 These boys' minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!

 Yes, you do, you little pecker!
