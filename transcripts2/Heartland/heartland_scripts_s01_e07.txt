 PreViously on "Heartland": Mom! 
 I love you, Mom. 
 So how come you're going through all moms stuff and you're making all these decisions about things that. . .? 
 You're not even planning to stick around. 
 Because somebody has to, Amy. 
 Well, your mom always said you had "the gift". 
 You can't ask her to work miracles in two seconds in front of a crowd. lsn't that what horse whispers do? 
 I am not a horse whisperer. I've never claimed to be. 
 What's the deal with the babes? 
 Here's the deal with them: you keep ten feet away at all times. 
 Any part of you that crosses that line will be removed. 
 Oh, I have a question. How much does Jack pay you? 
 I think every boy needs a good man in his life. 
 Heck, who doesn't, hey? 
 Stop! Both of you! There's a way to work this out! 
 Maybe intense family therapy? 
 Dad, we're practically neighbors. 
 Yeah. I told you I wasn't planning on leaving town, and your grandfather has no say in that. 
 This is my property, and I want you off it. 
 Easy, Jack. I'm just here to see my daughters. That's my right. 
 You left out the part about him being in town? 
 Every time I mention dad to you, you made it perfectly clear you didn't want to see him. 
 JACK: Your mother and l, we were just trying to protect you, girls. 
 Amy! Amy! Wait! 
 Don't they have machines for that? 
 Apparently not since Jack was born. 
 No, no, no, no, no. Over there. lt's the third rail of the triple bar. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 My parents go to Saskatoon, and all they bring me back is a T-shirt. 
 His aunt goes to South of France, and she gives him all this stuff! 
 Yeah, it's great. 
 So, you're gonna, give me the jumping lessons after this, right? 
 No, forget it. You can't ride in here. 
 You'll chew up all the grass and wreck the footing. 
 So, what's the point? 
 The point? So you can work your butt off and watch Ben and his horse jump over fancy striped poles and cute little flower boxes. 
 [ Laughing ] 
 Shut up and keep digging. 
 Okay, cut it out, you two. Look. 
 I know all this is important to you, Ben, but I need you to get that stall ready for the pregnant mare. 
 And I told you I'd get to it. 
 Well, it's a little late now. 
 Grandpa! Heartland is no place for a pregnant mare! 
 We're not set up as a breeding facility. 
 Oh, I figured we should make an exception this time. 
 Ray's a friend. 
 Funny, you never mentioned your good friend Ray before. 
 Okay, more like a friend of a friend. 
 Grandpa, lf we made an exception for every friend of a friend. . . 
 I ran into him last week, he asked me on the roundup up at Sheep River. 
 Twelve hours in the saddle? With your arthritis? 
 Yeah, I know. But. . . it's a done deal. 
 Whatever. . . Just don't expect me to play midwife to a horse! 
 Easy, girl. 
 MR. PHlLLlPS: Hey, thanks for helping me out, Jack. 
 No problem. Glad we could help ya. 
 Did she travel okay, Mr. Phillips? 
 Kicked around a bit, but Melody's always been a nervous mare. 
 Well, do you want me to lead her out for you? 
 I think, Amy, it's best if I do it. I'm not sure how she'll react to a stranger. 
 Come on, Melody, old girl. . . 
 . . .let's get you going. 
 AMY: Mr. Phillips! 
 JACK: Ray! 
 Oh, my God! Watch out! She's loose! 
 AMY: Watch out! 
 Melody! 
 Easy. 
 Easy. . . 
 Good girl. Good girl. 
 Oh, easy, girl. 
 Somebody call Scott, quickly! 
 And at the break of day You sank into your dream You dreamer You dreamer You dreamer Well, the horse was lucky. 
 No broken bones, as far as I can tell without an X-ray. 
 Keep a clean dressing on her, avoid infection, and she's got a good chance of carrying to term. 
 My mother always used to go to Mrs. Bell for herbs when she had foaling mares. 
 And I used to tell her that there were more effective ways to prevent premature labor. I'm betting she didn't listen. lf the foal's born now, things could get a little dicey. 
 Talk to Mrs. Bell if you want. 
 But don't stop the antibiotics, no matter what she says. 
 Jack, I can pay you for them broken jumps. 
 Oh, forget it, Ray. 
 I never wanted the damn things here in the first place. 
 Yeah, still, I feel bad about the way things turned out, you know. 
 Saddling you with a foaling mare and all, was almost bad enough. 
 But now with the complications. 
 No, no, I'll keep you updated when I come out for the roundup. 
 Well, you don't have to do that, Jack. 
 Would be good to get away. 
 What with that pregnant mare, the estrogen level around here is going right through the roof. 
 [ Laughing ] 
I suppose so, buddy. 
 Hey, Lou. 
 I told them we weren't set up as a breeding facility, and now this. 
 Well, I'll try to drop by every day and check in on her. 
 Every day? As long as it's on Ray's tab. 
 Come on, Lou. You know it's not a billing issue. 
 Yeah. I guess I do. 
 Look, Scott. We need to talk. 
 Carl and I just broke up, and we were together for over a year, so. . . 
 I just think for the next little while. . . 
 Actually, Lou, I just kind of meant that you're on my route, and one extra horse, more or less, won't make a difference. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 [ Horse neighs ] 
 Ty? 
 Hey. What are you doing here? 
 I just came to check on Melody. I'm keeping an eye on her. 
 Hm-mm. 
 Maybe we could take shifts. 
 Four hours on, four hours off, kind of thing? 
 Yeah, sounds good. 
 All right. 
 I got the first one. You can come back at uh, six. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 You know. . . 
 I might as well just stay. 
 I mean, I can't sleep anyway. 
 . . .blessed thistle and fennel seed to help with milk production. 
 Oh, this is great, Mrs. Bell. 
 I made a big batch of infusion from the raspberry leaves you gave me last time. 
 And this, have you tried raspberry leaves? 
 Oh, boys, oh boys, that's the best for expecting mares. 
 Yes. Thank you. Thank you. This is great. 
 How's Sugarfoot doing? 
 Oh, fine and dandy, dear. Thank you for asking. 
 Plenty of fresh air and lots of hard work in my garden, keeps me fit as a fiddle. 
 But Sugarfoot here, I'm afraid the old boy's starting to show his age. Giddy-up. I'm worried about Mrs. Bell. She's deaf as a post. 
 She's still pretty with it. 
 And, Amy! Don't forget to say hi to your mom for me! 
 Sorry I'm late. We have to watch Melody 2 4/7. 
 Oh, it's fine. More time for me to hang with Ben. 
 I am so excited for the show this weekend. 
 Maybe I shouldn't come. ls it that obvious? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, it's okay. From now on, I'll just play more hard to get. 
 Hey, Amy, you see that last fence? lt was perfect. 
 Yeah, just remember to sit back and wait-- 
 You and Red make such a great team. 
 And don't rush the fences. 
 Yeah. I've got to work on that. 
 So. . . That hard to get thing, how's that working out for ya? 
 So, how's she doing? 
 Seems okay. 
 So I'm just wondering if you can spare some time away. 
 I don't know. 
 Well, I'm heading up to Sheep River to help out on a roundup and. . . 
 A Roundup? Like, git-along-little-dogie roundup? 
 Yeah, yeah, it's a big spread. They could use an extra hand. 
 You think you're up for that? 
 You're asking me if I want to ride the range, round up cattle, drive 'em back, whooping and a-hollering all the live long day? 
 Well, we try to limit the whooping and a-hollering to half the live long day, but. . . I'm in! 
 TY: Mallory! 
 Hey. 
 Uh. . . I need some more riding lessons. 
 Maybe I could pencil you in. Let's see. How about now? 
 Uh, not now. Not here. Not with so many people around. 
 Oh, secret riding lessons. That'll cost you extra. 
 Oh, don't bother setting a place for Ty. I'll take him something after dinner. 
 Amy, I'm glad you and Ty have worked out a schedule, but don't forget we have tons of other stuff to do around here. 
 Ah, don't worry, Lou. I can pick up the slack. 
 Oh, yeah? Can you cook? 
 Are you kidding? Step aside. 
 All right. 
 [ Phone rings ] 
 Hello? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Ben. lt's for you. lt's your aunt. 
 Tell her I'm not here. 
 Ben! 
 I don't want to talk to her. 
 That is practically a grand prix jumping ring out there. 
 You've got to at least thank her. 
 Yeah, well, you like it so much, why don't you thank her? 
 His aunt's only buying him that stuff because she feels bad for dumping him here. 
 Mallory. 
 Hey! 
 Look, I hate to be the bearer of bad vibes, but what with Melody taking up most of your and Ty's time, grandpa going to the roundup and now you coaching Ben at the show this weekend, we have a scheduling problem. 
 Yeah, looking after Melody is non-negotiable. 
 And I promised Ben and Soraya. . . 
 This is why I never wanted to have a pregnant mare in the barn. 
 Come here, Lou. Give me your hand. Come here. lt's moving! 
 Shhh. I gotta keep her calm. 
 I felt it kick. 
 Don't worry about the schedule, Lou. I'll figure something out. 
 Come on, I'm ready. Let's do this. I'm your teacher, and I say you're not ready. 
 How much am I paying you for this again? 
 Nothing. And you still owe me for the last one. 
 Right, put this on my tab. 
 Hee-ya! 
 Wait up! 
 Come on! 
 Oh, my. . . ! 
 Pull up! Pull up! 
 Whoa! 
 Are you okay? 
 Whooo! Yeah. 
 No problem. lt's just like riding a motorcycle. 
 Only the suspension sucks. 
 Oh, hi, Jack. You're probably wondering why we're out here. 
 But there's no mystery. There's no secret. We're just. . . 
 We're just going for a ride. Exercising the horses. 
 I see, well, while you're at it, you might want to tie this on a little tighter. 
 I was wondering where that went. 
 You might want to tie yourself on a little tighter too. 
 Wanna do it again? 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I hand-walked Melody. lt's your turn to watch her. 
 All right, I'm on it. 
 Oh! 
 Thanks. 
 Ow! 
 Ah! 
 What's wrong with Ty? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, he's walking kind of funny. 
 I can't tell you. lt's a secret. 
 I gave Ty riding lessons. 
 We went galloping through the trails. 
 You went galloping? Are you sure Ty's ready for that? 
 Of course not. That's why he fell. 
 Why the sudden urge to ride? 
 Because he was invited to the cattle roundup. 
 Ty? 
 Yeah, Jack asked him. 
 But he's hopeless on a horse. 
 That's why I've been giving him lessons. 
 But who's gonna look after Melody when I'm at the horse show? 
 Not Ty. He's psyched about the roundup. 
 Are you sure you're up for this? 
 Me? lt's you I'm worried about. 
 From where I'm standing, it's you that doesn't look like much of a cowboy. lt's just a hat, Jack. lt does the job. 
 Ty. 
 What's this for? 
 So you won't look like a total dork on the roundup. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 What do you think? 
 I think that's my second best hat, and if you lose it, you owe me 50 bucks. 
 50 bucks. 
 Good to see you, Jack. How's that little mare of mine doing? 
 Doing fine, Ray. Amy's watching her around the clock. 
 I suppose you know most of the fellas here. 
 I don't know if you've met our trail boss. . . Tim. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I could ask you the same question. 
 I see you two have already met. 
 Well, good morning, everybody. 
 Thank you all for coming and helping today. 
 Looks like we've got pretty good weather, so we're probably gonna find most of the herd up in the high country. 
 I saw a few strays when I came in this morning. 
 But I also saw a couple of bears, so keep your eyes open, all right? 
 And I guess the fun part today is gonna be getting the cows across Muggins Creek back over to this side, but I'm sure some of you will be up for that. 
 MAN: Oh, yeah. 
 Hey, isn't that guy--? 
 The trail boss. Wasn't he at the Open House--? 
 What's the deal with you? 
 Don't ask any more dumb questions and make darn sure you stick with me. 
 So you can insult me some more? Why would I do that? 
 Because you're riding one of my horses, you're wearing one of my hats. 
 I figure that makes me your trail boss. 
 And, Jack, if you ever get a leg over maybe, well, maybe, you might want to take the old logging road up to Chimney Rock, work your way down from there. lt's nice, it's easy. 
 Well, I appreciate the suggestion. I'll take it under advisement. 
 Okay, take your time. 
 Okay, let's have fun, let's get it done. 
 Ya, ya, come on! 
 Ya, ya, come on. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Ben. 
 Hey. 
 About the show this weekend. 
 Yeah. I have a really good feeling. Red's totally on his game. 
 Yeah, you'll do fine. As long as you don't rush him at the fences. 
 Yeah, well, tell me when we walk the course. So I'll remember. 
 Um, see, the thing is, I can't go. I've got to stay and watch Melody. 
 But you can walk the course with Soraya. 
 Yeah. Okay. Whatever. 
 This way. 
 What happened to going up to the high country? 
 Change of plans. 
 But didn't the head guy say-- ? 
 I don't need anybody to tell me where the cows are at. 
 This late in the season, they'll all have come down into the coulee. 
 You're the boss. 
 Oh, my God, Amy! I'm sorry you're not coming, but two days alone with Ben! 
 And one night. lt's not like anything's gonna happen. 
 Oh, my God! Don't tell my mom! 
 You have to tell your mom. 
 Okay. Fine. But not until we're on the road. 
 Nice. 
 Exactly. 
 [ Cows moo ] 
 Ya! Come on, come on! 
 Ya! 
 Yeah. Plenty of cows down here. 
 Shut up. 
 Matter of fact, I think I see one right now. 
 Oh, wait, that's just your horse's ass in my face. 
 I said shut up and listen. 
 The mother lode. 
 I told ya. Now, that's cow sense. 
 Ya! Ya! Ya! Come on! 
 I might have missed a couple on the way down. 
 You're welcome to them. 
 Of course it might be difficult to catch on foot. 
 Ha! 
 Three more! 
 Ya! Ya! 
 Come on! Let's go! 
 Amy? 
 I just saw Ben's trailer going up the driveway. He went alone? 
 No. Soraya went with him. 
 Soraya and Ben? 
 For two days. . . And one night. 
 Look, Lou. 
 I mean, Ben may like Soraya, but it's not like he actually "likes" her. 
 Too bad no one told that to my mom. 
 Soraya! What happened? 
 My mother happened. 
 I called her up to tell her we were gonna be away at the show for two days. 
 And one night. 
 I even told her nothing was gonna happen. 
 That was even before I knew for sure nothing was gonna happen. 
 I made Ben bring me back. He's never going to talk to me again. 
 Not that it matters anymore. 
 By the way, thanks for the heads up on the "liking". 
 [ Cows moo ] 
 Hey. I was beginning to wonder, but your cowboy cred just went up ten points. 
 There's another one up on that ridge. You stay here. 
 See if you can keep these ones from wandering off. 
 How do I do that? 
 You take that hat of mine off your head and wave it at 'em. 
 But make sure you wave it at the front end of the cow and not the back end. I'm assuming you know which end is which. 
 JACK: Hy-a! 
 You know, I just said that stuff about Ben so Lou would back off. lt doesn't matter if Ben likes me or not. 
 My mother's never gonna let me go anywhere that involves a boy. 
 Even a boy that doesn't like me. 
 There's a horse show next weekend. 
 Didn't you hear what I just said? I'm going. Ben's going. 
 That's supposed to make me feel better? 
 'Cause it's really not working. 
 The show's local. You don't even need to tell your mom you're going. 
 This is why you're my best friend. 
 Hey, cows. 
 [ Cow moos ] 
 [ Cow moos ] 
 Okay. Stay right there. I'll be back in a couple of minutes. 
 Hey, cows! I'm watching you! Don't mess with me! 
 [ Cow moos ] 
 Go, boy. Come on! Come on! Come on! 
 Get up there. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 You give him one simple job. 
 Ty? 
 Jack! I'm down here! 
 What the hell are you doing down there? 
 What do you think? 
 I think you owe me 50 bucks. 
 [ Phone rings ] 
 Hello? 
 Oh, hi, Mrs. Stillman. 
 Um, no, he's not here right now. He's at a horse show. 
 Oh, yeah, no, the jumps arrived. They're awesome. 
 Oh, he didn't? 
 Well, I'm sure he's just. . . lt's not that he doesn't appreciate it. 
 You know, when you get a big gift, and sometimes. . . 
 Amy! I think Melody's going into labor! 
 Scott said she still got two weeks. 
 She decided not to wait. I'm sorry, Mrs. Stillman. I've got to go. 
 Yeah, no, I'll have Ben call you, but. . . 
 See, the truth is he thinks you're trying to buy him off so you can dump him here. 
 Next time I tell you not to do something, don't do it. 
 I heard this calf down here, so I started coming down. 
 My horse went into a slide. So, I bailed. 
 Can you ride? lt's not really an issue. ln case you haven't noticed, my horse took off. 
 So, what's your plan now, cowboy? lsn't it your job to come up with the plan, boss? 
 Well, when you talk to him, let him know it's an emergency. Thanks. 
 She seems to be in a lot of pain. I don't like the way she looks. 
 What do we do? 
 I don't know. Sometimes foals get stuck in the wrong position. 
 We better just wait for Scott. 
 Well, it might be a long wait. 
 He's in Okotoks, with a horse that just colicked. 
 Well, I've watched mom deliver foals before, but, I mean, whenever things got complicated, she always called Scott. 
 Except for this one time when Mrs. Bell came over with all these herbs. I'll call her. 
 No, you can't. She's deaf. You're gonna have to go get her. 
 Anything. As long as I don't have to play midwife to a horse. 
 Great plan there, Jack. 
 Spend the night in the middle of nowhere. 
 I wouldn't have thought of that myself. 
 Better than trying to ride back in the dark on one horse. 
 [ Noise ] 
 What's that? 
 My stomach. Gotten used to three square a day. 
 [ Rattling ] 
 They got rattlesnakes out here? 
 Some. 
 Wolves? 
 Coyotes. 
 [ Howling ] 
 More coyotes? 
 Nope. Those are wolves. 
 [ Branches break ] 
 What's that? I'm not exactly sure. 
 Anybody here lose a horse? 
 Shhh. . . 
 So, what's the matter with the little darling? 
 Oh, I think the foal might be stuck. I don't see a head. 
 Boys, oh, boys! 
 I don't see a little head. 
 After your mare has foaled, this will stop the bleeding. 
 There's Chamomile, rose-hips, fever-few. 
 But first thing, Lou dear, boil some water and put these in a pot. lt's probably an infusion, something to help the contractions. 
 Nothing like a nice cup of peppermint tea. 
 I take two sugars and a titch of milk. lt's gonna to be a long night. 
 Okay, how's that? 
 Yeah, that's better. lf I don't move. 
 Or laugh. 
 Luckily, no one's laughing. I've got sandwiches. I've got sandwiches. I've got. . . 
 Well, actually, I've got baloney. 
 Baloney and baloney. 
 Make mine baloney. 
 Thanks. I'm not hungry. lt's just what I was afraid of. 
 Mother Nature needs a little help. 
 What does she mean? 
 I think she needs to turn the foal. 
 We need to turn the foal over and pull her out. 
 These old fingers ain't what they used to be. 
 Oh, where is Marion when you need her? 
 Amy, Lou, roll up your sleeves. 
 Me? You don't expect me to--? 
 Lou, come on. The mare's tiring. 
 But what about--? lsn't there a Plan B? 
 You are Plan B. 
 This is exactly why I never wanted to have a pregnant mare in the barn! 
 Ewww! 
 Ugh! 
 You sure you don't want the last one, Jack? They're not half bad. 
 No, thank you. 
 Jack doesn't want any baloney. Jack just wants to eat himself up inside. 
 Well, if you change your mind, Jack, you know, you just let me know. I'm happy to help you out. 
 Don't count on that happening anytime soon. 
 Well, that's funny to hear you say that because it seems like every time I've run into you lately, I've done nothing but help you out. 
 The hell you have. 
 Come on. Amy gets hurt, Ty here gets wracked up. 
 Bit of a pattern, don't you think? lt's kind of a pattern: you screw up, I help you out. 
 Careful, pal. 
 And one of these days I'm gonna be helping you get up on your horse. 
 I guess that's what happens when an older man tries to do a younger man's job. 
 Like gathering up cattle or trying to be a father. 
 You son of a. . . ! 
 [ Grunt, crash ] 
 What the--? 
 Get off him! 
 What's the deal with you, guys? 
 What? He didn't tell ya? 
 I was married to his daughter. 
 Why, you call that a marriage. 
 You're Amy and Lou's dad? 
 Oh, I've got it! 
 When you get the head, you're gonna have to ease it around. lt's working. 
 Okay, Lou, I'm gonna need you to grab the foal's hooves and pull when the mare pushes. 
 Pull on the what--? 
 Lou! Get in there and help your sister! 
 Come on, girls! Here it comes! 
 Pull! 
 Pull! 
 Oh, my God! lt's a girl! 
 Alrighty! lt's a girl! 
 Now, where's that tea? I think we could all use a cup. ln you go! 
 [ Cows moo ] 
 Here we go! 
 Come on, get in! 
 Hey! 
 I can't speak for Jack, but I appreciate what you did for us. 
 Next time I'll try and stay on my horse. 
 How are the ribs? 
 The bandage helps. . . 
 . . .a little. 
 See you made yourself a new friend. 
 I don't get you, guys. 
 I mean, it's not just you. lt's your whole family. 
 This whole time I've been here, nobody said a word about Lou and Amy having a father. 
 I just figured he was dead or something. 
 Might as well have been. 
 You can keep the hat. 
 You earned it. 
 [ Dog barks ] 
 Ben! Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Melody had her foal. 
 Oh, that's great. 
 Yeah. She was born this morning. 
 How was the horse show? 
 Ah, I got third in the jump off. 
 Awesome! 
 Come on, Red. 
 Hey. I guess it's okay. 
 What? Third's just another word for loser? lf I ever got a third, I'd be jumping up and down. 
 Yeah. lt would have been okay to have somebody there, jumping up and down. 
 Yeah, well, next weekend I will be. Definitely. 
 Hey, what about the horses? 
 Take care of 'em. 
 Hey there, cowboys. 
 Grandpa, what happened? 
 Well, he's grumpy today. 
 He had a few issues with Ray's new trail boss. 
 Looks like his arthritis is acting up. 
 No, that was the trail boss too. 
 They have a fairly old school approach to conflict resolution, your dad and Jack. 
 They don't feed you on these roundups? 
 Not to my liking. 
 I used to enjoy a good roundup, but these days, they'll hire anyone as a trail boss. 
 Ty told me. 
 Melody had her foal. 
 How'd that go? lt's a. . . lt had its moments. 
 Why don't you let me do that for ya? I'll call you when it's ready. 
 Hi there, Lisa. 
 Hi. 
 You come by to take a look at your fancy new jumping course? 
 Among other things. 
 Well, what has happened to you? 
 Well, I guess you have to watch the movie. 
 I see. 
 That's mighty impressive. lt's got all the bells and whistles. 
 Oh, Jack. lt's just jumps. I'm not feeding your family and paying your mortgage. lt's just a bunch of jumps, so our kids can do better at horse shows, all right? 
 You're a generous woman, nonetheless. 
 Well, generous to a fault, I understand, if you ask my nephew. ls he around? ln the barn, most likely. 
 Okay. I'll see you later. 
 You know. . . 
 . . .Lou is, uh, trying her hand at pancakes. 
 I can't guarantee the results, but you'd sure be welcome to join us. 
 All right, thank you. That sounds lovely. 
 You got a third! 
 Yeah, he kept up all his rails. I was only a second off of first. 
 Well, good for you. 
 I wish you'd told me you had a show this weekend. 
 There's one every weekend. 
 Ben, honey. 
 You can come back to Fairfield anytime you like. 
 You don't have to stay here because I bought some jumps. 
 You know, if you would have told me that a couple of weeks ago, I would have been back in a second. 
 But, uh, I don't know. I'm starting to like it here, Lisa. lt's kind of growing on me. 
 And practicing over those jumps, it really does help. 
 Really. So. . . Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Come here. 
 Congratulations! 
 Thanks. 
 What are you gonna call her? 
 Daybreak. Because she was born-- 
 Wait. Let me guess. . . At the break of day? 
 You're one smart cowboy. 
 Speaking of cowboys. lf my dad was working at a ranch a couple of miles up the road, I might want to get to know him. lt's not like he's gonna be stopping in for Sunday dinner anytime soon. 
 Not if Jack has his way. 
 So that makes it your move.
