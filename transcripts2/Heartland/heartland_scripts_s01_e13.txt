 Previously on 'Heartland': 
 I just set it up so you could practice jumping here. lt's amazing. 
 I saw your name on the entry list for the Fall Finale. 
 I didn't think you'd have the points. 
 Well, I don't yet, but I entered in the Hudson show. 
 I got an e-mail from that investment company in New York, and they want to bring me in for an interview. 
 [ Sighs ]... 
 Who's coaching you? 
 Me. 
 Come on, Ty, you can barely stay on a horse, man. 
 I guess that's what happens... when an older man tries to do a younger man's job. 
 Like gather around cattle. Or trying to be a father. 
 I am going to that interview. 
 And you should. 
 Spartan, number 1 5, rider/owner Amy Fleming of Heartland Ranch. 
 44.494 seconds. No faults. 
 Only one competitor left. You know who. 
 Okay, remember to keep your hands quiet, all right? 
 Okay, good luck. 
 And now, in the ring, number 65, Apollo, rider, Ashley Stanton, owner, Briar Ridge. 
 Oh, shoot. 
 Number 65, Ashley Stanton on Apollo. 
 45.502 seconds. 1 fault. 
 Ladies and gentlemen. 
 The winners of the Hudson Equestrian jumping event. ln third place, Ashley Stanton on Apollo. ln second place, Amy Fleming on Spartan. 
 And in first place... 
 Not bad. Not bad. 
 Thanks, Coach. 
 That was amazing. 
 You can enter the Fall Finale. You've got the points. 
 Excuse me, Amy? 
 Jake Anderson. Pleased to meet you. 
 Pleased to meet you too, Jake. I'm a big fan. I've read all about you. 
 Hi. 
 Are you riding in the Fall Finale? 
 Uh, yeah, I am. 
 Great. Maybe I'll see you there. 
 You too. 
 Oh, Mallory. 
 Looks like you got yourself a cowboy. 
 Just shut up. 
 VAL: Well, it's not good enough. 
 This jumper costs $1 00 grand, and you barely placed. 
 How do you think that makes Briar Ridge look? 
 Like a third-rate trail riding center. That's what. Well, that's it, Ashley. 
 I am not spending another dime on horses or fancy trainers... 
 ...if that's all you can come up with. 
 ♪ And at the break of day♪ 
♪ You sank into your dream♪ 
♪ You dreamer♪ 
♪ You dreamer♪ 
♪ You dreamer♪ 
 I wish Lou could have seen you. She would have been mighty proud. 
 When does she get back from New York? 
 Uh, her interview is tomorrow. 
 She should be back a couple of days after that. 
 What if she stays? My mom bet me five dollars she would. 
 Did your boyfriend call you yet? 
 Shut up. 
 Are you expecting someone, Grandpa? 
 Oh, no. No. Just looks like some weather coming in, is all. 
 I hope not. I've gotta practice before school tomorrow. 
 Well, not if it's all iced up and slippery, you're not. 
 Well, then, I'll sand it tonight. I've got no other place to practice, Grandpa. 
 How about it, Coach? I'll help. 
 Me too. 
 What about these dishes? 
 'l'm not expecting anyone.' 
 JACK: Just some weather blowing in. 
 Some fine looking weather, I'd say. 
 Just clear the way, will ya? Just... 
 Hi, Lisa. 
 Hello, everyone. 
 Hello. Good-bye. 
 Good-bye. 
 Hey. Ben told me you placed really well today. Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Good for you. 
 Do I smell coffee? 
 Yes, you do. 
 Good. Bye, Amy. 
 Bye. 
 What? We're gonna watch the hockey game. 
 Hmm-mm. 
 Unless there's any objections? 
 They're so cute at that age. lt's so gross. 
 Aw, come on. Give Jack a break. 
 He's just celebrating. 
 He's pretty proud of you today, Amy. 
 Everybody in the stands knew you were his granddaughter. 
 Great. 
 You know, it was actually pretty exciting. 
 You know, I was into it. lt's like any sport, right? 
 You need a game plan. 
 A game plan? 
 Yeah. Putting you on a training schedule. 
 [ Sighs ]... 
 ...l'm not going all hard core. 
 Listen to your coach. You gotta beat Ashley. 
 We've only got a week left. 
 Would you guys just calm down? I mean, it's just a horse show. 
 The Fall Finale isn't just any horse show. 
 Okay, well, I'm totally happy with my second place today. 
 Right. That's like saying you're totally happy... 
 ...that your dad didn't show up. 
 He was probably busy. 
 So, what do you think? 
 Hey, you beat your personal best time. 
 And I think your only real competition is Amy. 
 Oh, give me a break. 
 She might place in a small town nothing show, but Amy doesn't stand a chance at the Fall Finale. 
 I don't know. Don't underestimate her. 
 VAL: Or her horse. 
 She already beat you once. 
 We don't want a repeat of that, do we? 
 Take him around again. 
 You see? 
 That's the problem right there. The horse is inconsistent. I'm telling you right now, if he doesn't improve, I'm selling him. 
 You can't just sell him. Apollo belongs to me. 
 Oh, really? 
 Hmph. 
 Who paid for him, sweetheart? Apollo belongs to Briar Ridge. 
 No way. I will not ask Amy for help. Have you lost your mind? 
 Your mom's right. 
 Excuse me? 
 Apollo. He's inconsistent, Ashley. Something's getting to him. 
 And Amy's pretty good at figuring stuff like that out. 
 I mean, it's kinda spooky how good she is. 
 Oh, my God, Ben. Don't start. 
 Look, I'm not asking Amy for help. 
 Ever. I'm glad you're taking that coaching thing seriously, but it'd be nice if you did the job I pay you for. 
 We're gonna be buried in snow before we know it. 
 There's a hell of a lot of winterizing to do. 
 Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm on it. 
 Just a reminder. 
 Oh, and, um, Clint Riley's coming at the end of the week. 
 So, don't do another disappearing act. 
 I won't. I'd like to, but I won't. 
 You're not worried, are you? 
 Well, don't be. I'm sure you're not what Clint would call a 'threat to society'. 
 Thanks. 
 And, uh, I'll vouch for you. You know that. 
 I appreciate that, Jack. I do. 
 Duly noted. 
 [ Laughing ] 
 Uh, there's a letter for you. 
 Fix up that tack. lt looks like a rat's nest. 
 So, how did the interview go? 
 Well, that's good. When are you coming home? 
 Okay. Yeah. You have a safe trip. We'll see you soon. Bye. 
 That's Lou. lt went okay. 
 The interview. She thought they were suitably impressed. 
 That's great. 
 Yeah. Yeah. Good for her. 
 Look, Amy. We can't stop Lou from doing what she wants to do. lf she wants to work in New York again, well, there's not much we can say about that. 
 I know. lt just, I don't know, it feels weird without her here. 
 I am so hungry. 
 I would probably fall on the side of the road and freeze to death... 
 ...if I tried to walk home now. 
 I mean, my mom's on one of her crazy diets. 
 We have no food in our fridge. Do you guys have any cheese? 
 Nice to see you, Mallory. Come on in. 
 Ugh. Great. 
 Look who's here. 
 Hey. 
 Okay. I need your help. 
 But why me? I mean, what about your 'world class' coaches? 
 They were useless, so I fired them. Just say yes. 
 Well, I'm gonna have to think about it. 
 Um, no. I mean, come on, isn't that what you do? 
 What you're always going on about? 
 About you having this, whatever, gift with problem horses. 
 Okay, but, Ashley... 
 Look, I'll pay you. A lot. 
 How much? lt's not about the money. 
 Okay, your horse doesn't have a problem. lt's not troubled. lt's not abused. 
 That's a matter of opinion. 
 Apollo definitely has a problem. 
 Look, you've seen him. lt's like he freezes. And I don't know why. 
 Yeah, well, neither do l. 
 Amy, please. 
 Look, if I don't do well at the Finale, my mom's gonna sell Apollo, and, I can't let her do that... 
 ...because it's the only horse I've ever had a real connection with. 
 Please. I need your help. lf I could, I'd help, but I just physically don't have the time. 
 She's busy training her own horse. 
 Well, that'll be a bit hard, considering... 
 Considering what? 
 Well, considering that if you don't help me, Ben is gonna come over here and take his jumps back to Fairfield. 
 I mean, they belong to him, after all. 
 Think about it. 
 Are you kidding? Ashley asked you to help her? 
 Yeah, and if I don't, she's gonna get Ben to take away all his jumps. lt's blackmail, pure and simple. 
 [ Sighs ]... 
 ...I don't know if I can do it. 
 Well, of course you can't do it. 
 Like you're gonna help the enemy? 
 How would you feel if you fixed Apollo and then Ashley won? 
 Like crap. 
 Yeah. So, I'm your coach, and I say you don't do it. 
 Great, and then Ashley's gonna get Ben to take away his jumps, and you'll have nothing to coach me on. 
 You know what, Amy? Do what you want, okay? lt obviously doesn't matter how hard we've worked. 
 What's his problem? 
 He's right. There's no way you need to help Ashley. 
 You don't need anybody's help. I mean, you're looking great. 
 Your horse is totally with you. 
 So, why does he do what he does sometimes? 
 I don't know. Maybe he just has an off day. 
 I wouldn't worry about it. 
 You think? 
 I do. 
 Amy, thanks. Really. 
 No problem. But I should go. 
 VAL: Amy. 
 VAL: How lovely to see you. 
 Listen, before you go running off, I want you to watch something. 
 Take him around again, Ashley. 
 Mother. 
 Humor me. 
 He's just not performing. 
 I don't get it. 
 She's doing something wrong. I'm not. 
 Ashley, the horse is not performing. Figure it out. lt's not the horse. 
 What is it, then? lt's you. 
 Oh, of course it is. 
 No, what I mean is when you're watching Ashley, the whole dynamic between her and Apollo changes. 
 Well, I'm not doing anything. 
 When you sense that your mother's watching you, you tense up. 
 You clench the reins tighter. You dig your knees in. 
 I mean, you probably don't realize you're doing it, but you are. 
 You're just telegraphing your fear to Apollo, and so he tenses up too. 
 That's ridiculous. I've been watching Ashley ride since she could get on a horse. 
 Just listen. 
 All right, I'm listening. What do we do? 
 Well, if you want your daughter to win any ribbons, you shouldn't be in the arena. 
 Maybe you shouldn't be either. 
 Thank you. 
 I would've never had the guts to say those things to my mother. 
 No problem. 
 But, ah, don't think I'll be doing you any favors. 
 Because when I'm at that course at the Fall Finale, ...l'll be there to win. 
 So will l. 
 Ty? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, uh, I just have this probation thing coming up. So... 
 ...l'm kinda stressed out. lt's the last one, right? 
 No worries. 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Are you still mad at me? 
 No. Mallory told me you went to Briar Ridge today. 
 What was the problem? 
 Well, it was kinda weird. 
 Apollo was totally fine one minute and then really tense the next. 
 Sorta like someone I know. 
 [ Laughing ] 
 And don't tell me. You figured it out. Right? 
 So, did Ashley give you a big fat thank you? 
 No. She told me she's gonna beat my ass at the Fall Finale. 
 What am I gonna do with you? 
 Hey, at least now we have Ben's jumps to practice on. Right? 
 Practice? Oh, yeah. Weren't we supposed to practice today? 
 Oh, no, wait. You were too busy coaching our competition. 
 Ty. 
 We have jumps to test out, Amy. Timings to do. 
 Look at you. Your face is all red. 
 You completely ignore my schedule. 
 You don't care about my training program, about my jump configurations. lt looks like a pretzel. 
 You are so annoying. You never listen to me. 
 I do. Okay? I do listen to you. 
 Anything you wanna tell me, I will listen. 
 Amy. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna do my homework. 
 And then when I come out, I promise you can time my jumps. Okay? 
 Okay. 
 I promise. 
 LOU: Hello. 
 Lou. 
 Hey, you. 
 Hey there, stranger. 
 Hi, Grandpa. 
 Oh, I missed you, guys. 
 So, how was it? 
 Agh, so good. Brand-new offices. 
 Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. 
 I don't think I made a total fool of myself. 
 And... Oh, the hotel. lt had a spa. I had a massage and a facial. 
 Agh, I forgot how the big city feels. 
 You know, there's just so much energy. 
 So much noise. I love the noise. 
 Well, good. When are you gonna hear back from them? 
 I have no idea. They didn't say. lt was so good of Scott to pick me up from the airport. 
 Hey, could you put those in my room? 
 Sure. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Now, where was it? 
 What? 
 Hey, Miss. 
 Hey. 
 Haven't seen you in a while. What have you been up to? 
 Yeah, well. Ray sent me to Montana to an auction. 
 But I'm back. 
 Heard you did real well at the show. You two gonna be in the Finale? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Amy, I've got something for you. 
 That was your mother's. lt was her school ring. 
 She gave it to me when I was on the circuit for good luck. 
 But I think you should have it. 
 Dad. lt's beautiful. 
 Thank you. Thanks. I'll wear it. I'll wear it to the Finale. 
 Are you gonna be able to come? 
 Yup. Well, I'm gonna try. 
 Okay. 
 Amy, your Mom would be so proud of you. 
 Dad. lt's perfect that you're here. 
 I have the best news. 
 What? 
 I just got a call from New York. 
 I got the job. 
 Okay. 
 Why aren't you guys happy for me? 
 Well, I'm happy. As long as you are. 
 I am. 
 Well, that's good. 
 So glad you guys could share the moment with me. 
 Okay, I'll be honest. I don't want you to leave. 
 Never thought I'd hear you say that. 
 Yeah, well, I never thought I'd say it. Just stay, Lou. 
 Amy, it would be too easy for me to stay. 
 Oh, I can make it difficult. I promise. 
 [ Laughing ]... 
 ...I know grandpa says you should do whatever you think is best, but... 
 ...I don't know. I'm just gonna miss you. A lot. 
 Let's not even talk about Scott. 
 Scott? 
 
 
 
 Come on. 
 What? 
 He's in love with you, Lou. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Well, he's never said anything to me. 
 Yeah, and he probably never will. 
 Have you even told him you got the job? 
 That's great, Lou. I'm happy for you. 
 Really? 
 That's what you wanted. I'll never forget how upset you were that day... 
 ...when you lost your job there. 
 That's where you belong. 
 Oh, okay, but... 
 We need to celebrate. 
 Yeah. You know, maybe we could go out. 
 Absolutely. We can go for a coffee or something before you go. 
 Afternoon. Ty Borden around? 
 How am I supposed to know? 
 Okay, if you'll just put your John Henry right there, Mr. Bartlett... Jack... we'll be all set. I'm entitled to say, Ty Borden, that you've completed your probation period successfully. 
 So, keep your nose clean and your powder dry, as they say. 
 Uh... Sure, Clint. 
 And good luck with the rest of your life. 
 Thanks. 
 He is a good kid. 
 Yeah. Duly noted. I can see myself out. 
 So tomorrow is the big day. 
 Are you as nervous as I am? 
 Don't worry. We're gonna be fine. 
 You know, it still looks like a pretzel. 
 Your probation is over. That makes you a free man. 
 How does that feel? lt's all right. 
 How you feeling? About tomorrow. I'm sort of having an attack of 'Why am I doing this?' 
 I just, all of a sudden, I've put way too much emphasis on winning. 
 And l, I never wanted to do that. 
 I don't even know if I want to compete anymore. I'm a bit of a mess. 
 Hey, let's go for a drive. 
 AMY: I remember when you made this for me. 
 Seems like so long ago. lt was the first time I jumped Spartan on a course. 
 TY: Hmm-mm. 
 Feeling how bad he wanted to jump was the greatest thing. 
 And it was so obvious he loved it. 
 Well, so did you. 
 I know. 
 You know, it's not about winning, Amy. Not for you. I know that. lt's always been about the thrill of it. 
 Look at this. lt was my mom's. She gave it to my dad for luck. 
 And he gave it to me. 
 You know, it's funny. I can just be so mad at him. 
 And then... Then there he is, out of the blue, when it... when it really counts. 
 [ Amy sighs ] 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Come on. You're almost crying. 
 No, I'm not. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Yes, you are. 
 Get outta here. 
 You'll be fine. 
 So will you. 
 Amy Fleming on Spartan. 
43.372 seconds. She posts a clear. 
 Not bad. That first jump, though... 
 ...probably have a coach's corner about that one. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, four riders are now tied for first place. 
 They will all go on to the Jump Off. 
 The riders and their horses are: John Steel on Warhorse, Carol Reid riding Satin Doll, Ashley Stanton riding Apollo, and Amy Fleming riding Spartan. 
 CROWD: Yeah, Amy. 
 The Jump Off will begin in five minutes. 
 Don't be nervous, Amy. You'll be great. 
 [ Horse neighs ] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, Spartan. 
 Hey, what the hell you doing with my horse? 
 Stop it. 
 What do you want? 
 That's my horse. 
 I want him back. 
 You might wanna take a look at these. 
 Hey. Get the hell away from my granddaughter. 
 They're ownership papers. That horse is mine. 
 No, he's not. 
 A little bird told me he's competing again, so the animal's gotta be worth some money. 
 Just let Amy finish the rest of the competition. lf she does well in the Jump Off, the horse will be even more valuable. 
 Lou. 
 Okay. 
 We'll talk after it's over. 
 I just said that to get him away from you. 
 I can't... I can't do this. 
 Yes, you can. You don't let him spoil anything for you. 
 Now entering the ring, Carol Reid riding Satin Doll. 
 Amy, listen to me, okay? Don't think about that guy. 
 Now, look at this. Right here, okay? This is the last jump. 
 Now, the jump before it makes it extremely difficult to approach... 
 ...without making a wide arc. 
 But... and this is where my genius lies... 
 ...if you take it at this angle, like we practiced, you'll be totally set up for the last jump, you'll cut about two or three strides and gain about two seconds, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Watch her. 
 You see? She took a long arc to the approach. Slowed her down. 
 Carol Reid riding Satin Doll. 
 Good luck. 
 42.483 seconds. No faults. 
 Number 1 57, Spartan, owner/rider, Amy Fleming from Heartland Ranch. 
 [ Horse neighs ] 
 Spartan. 
 [ Horse neighs ] 
 Come on. 
 Let's go. 
 Whoa. Spartan. lt's okay. Come here. lf your horse isn't on the course in 30 seconds, he will be disqualified. 
 Hey. 
 Look. 
 There's no one here who's gonna hurt you, okay? 
 You're just gonna have to trust me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 We need to do this... For mom. 
 [ Spartan snorts softly ] 
 Okay? Good boy. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Good boy. 
 Come on. 
 A clear ride for Amy Fleming on Spartan. 40.509 seconds. 
 [ Applause ] 
 You're the girl to beat, and I'm the girl to do it. 
 That was awesome. Totally awesome. 
 Our last competitor, number 2 42, Apollo, rider, Ashley Stanton. 
 Owner, Briar Ridge. 
 Okay, I'm outta here. 
 Where are you going? 
 My daughter doesn't like me watching anymore. 
 Val, you have to. Your horse is bound to win. 
 Ashley. You're going off course. 
 Number 2 42, Apollo, rider, Ashley Stanton. Owner, Briar Ridge. 
 Disqualified. 
 Ash. You threw it. lt was worth it. Did you see the look on my mother's face? 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, the Jump Off results: Our winner is number 1 57, Amy Fleming on Spartan from Heartland Ranch. 
 [ Applause ]... 
 ...I can't believe it. 
 You did it. 
 I can't believe that horse can jump like that. 
 He turned in the air, like... 
 What was that all about? Was that just for me? 
 You promised you wouldn't watch. 
 What the hell were you doing out there? 
 Don't you speak to me like that, young lady. 
 And what were you doing with that disgusting man? 
 That's the gratitude I get. I tried to clear the way for you. 
 What did you do? lt doesn't matter. lt didn't work anyway. 
 You told Mallen about Spartan. That Amy was competing today. 
 You wanted her to lose her horse. 
 Ugh. I just put a bug in his ear. There was no harm done. Obviously. 
 Ashley, the horse still belongs to him. 
 He's got the papers to prove it. 
 Just like Apollo belongs to you? 
 Ashley. 
 Ashley. 
 So, he did good. I gotta thank you. My trailer's outside. 
 Where's my horse? 
 I don't want him anywhere near you, Mr. Mallen. 
 Get used to it. lf Spartan really is your horse... 
 I got the papers to prove it. 
 That's great, we just need to clear up a few expenses... 
 ...before you can take him. 
 Let's see, I've, uh, calculated the cost of keeping Spartan... 
 ...since Amy and my mother rescued him from your barn. 
 I have included his vet bills, which were... ouch. 
 Uh, of course, boarding, transportation, Amy's services as a trainer... 
 A horse doesn't win a championship by himself. 
 Plus his food. And I think that just about covers it. 
 [ Clears throat ]... 
 You must be crazy. 
 Horses aren't cheap, Mr. Mallen. 
 So, if you could just write a check for that amount, you're free to take the horse. 
 Otherwise, you're gonna want to talk to my lawyer. 
 He can be contacted in his Manhattan offices. 
 On Wall Street we call him 'the shark'. 
 Oh, and he may have a few questions... 
 ...about the authenticity of your ownership papers. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Laughing ] 
 Well, that was a great moment when she went over that last jump. 
 A great moment. 
 Look at you all proud. 
 [ Chuckling ] Yeah. 
 Who is that little cowboy? 
 You know, I'm amazed he even survived the day. 
 Hi there. 
 Who let you in? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Chip? 
 Thanks. 
 Allow me. 
 After you. 
 Hey. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey, Dad. I'm glad you could make it. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Right, Grandpa? 
 Well, Amy looked damn good out there today. 
 She couldn't have looked better. 
 So, you gonna take a swing at me if I step in your house? 
 [ Tim laughs ] 
 Just checking. 
 Come on, Dad, let me take your hat. 
 Okay. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. I'm Tim Fleming. I'm Amy and Lou's dad. 
 Oh, how nice to meet you. 
 Pleasure is mine. Who are you? I'm, uh, Jack's friend. 
 TlM: Ah. 
 Ah, lucky Jack. 
 Thank you. Well, you need a drink. Shall I show you to the bar? 
 TlM: Sure. 
 He's really mine. Can you believe it? lt's incredible. 
 I mean, did you see him go over that last jump? 
 He just about turned in the air. He's so amazing. 
 So are you, Amy. 
 Amy, um, I want to talk to you about something, okay? lt's kind of hard for me, but, l, uh, I want you to know that... 
 What? I'm so proud of you. I am. 
 And, and... 
 And? 
 [ Sighs ] And... 
 And no matter what happens, I just... 
 What is that supposed to mean, 'no matter what happens'? 
 Just... What it means... 
 Why are you being so weird? 
 Why are you asking so many questions? 
 Well, just, just talk to me. 
 Aren't you the one that never wants to talk? 
 You're right. Talking's overrated. 
 Ahem... 
 The party's in the house. 
 Uh, we were, we just, um... 
 Doing night check. ls that what you call that? 
 You should say hi to your guests. 
 I need to have a word with your coach. 
 Jack, Amy and l, we, we were just... 
 ...l, I was... 
 That's not where I'm going here. 
 Although... 
 ...l, uh, got to thinking... 
 ...after the meeting we had with our friend Clint. 
 I realize that your probation's up and all, and that you're free to go do whatever you want. 
 But I want you to know that you're welcome to stay. 
 I mean, just because your probation's over, it doesn't mean that you have to leave. 
 Your job and the loft, for what it is, is there for you. 
 Jack, l, uh, I gotta tell you something. lt's from my father. My real father. 
 I haven't had any contact with him since I was 1 2. 
 He tracked me down and, um, he says he's been looking for me... 
 ...for the past five years. 
 We've been e-mailing each other. 
 So, what are you thinking? 
 I don't know. I just, uh, maybe I'll go see him. 
 You know, uh, he kinda needs me right now. So... 
 Yeah, l, I bet that's a tough decision. l, uh, I'd sure hate to see you go, but I guess you gotta do what you think is best for you. 
 Just don't go thinking... 
 ...that he's gonna be some kind of hero for you, that father of yours. 
 Because he's just a man. Like anyone else. 
 You know how I feel about fathers who abandon their kids. 
 About the same way I feel about guys who kiss and run... 
 ...[ Sighs ] 
 Well, you think about it. 
 I hope you know that you can always call this home. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Can I help? 
 Thought you might be there today. 
 I was busy. Had emergency surgery. Amy told me about Mallen. 
 Sounds like you really set him straight. 
 Trust me. I've dealt with angry CEOs who make Mallen look like a kitten. 
 I gotta say this. I'm not gonna stop you from going, but it'd be crazy if, if you left without knowing how I feel about you. 
 Scott... 
 No. Listen. 
 Scott... 
 Listen. 
 Maybe you haven't noticed, but you have the ability to reduce me into a complete blithering idiot. 
 I embarrass myself totally whenever I see you. 
 But I love you. 
 There, I said it. So... 
 ...I love you, and if you go, I'm gonna follow you. 
 And embarrass you wherever you are. So look out. 
 Scott. 
 Scott.

 He was supposed to come in after he, uh, he finished with the horses. 
 No, I haven't seen him. 
 Okay.

 AMY: Ty. 
 Hey, Coach. You in here? 
 Ty.
