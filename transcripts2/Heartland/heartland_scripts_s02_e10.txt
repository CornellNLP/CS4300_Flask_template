 Previously on "Heartland"... 
 Something tells me you've done this before. 
 Once or twice. 
 Your dad's a legend on the circuit. 
 If you want to bring up your participation mark, I suggest you be there. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, Miss Adams? 
 I'm sorry, I can't. 
 You're not doing yourself any favors, are you, Amy? 
 What are you getting worked up about? 
 What happened to being reliable? 
 What happened to "leave things to me"? 
 Is there still something going on between you and Ty? 
 No, nothing's going on. 
 Nothing at all. 
 What do you want from me? 
 You move in next door, and you still have no clue what's going on in my life. 
 Maybe this isn't about a ride. Maybe it's about catching up. 
 Yeah, I'll take the bus. 
 Look, this isn't the Wild West. 
 If you see something, give us a call. 
 Don't get between a rustler and your livestock. 
 Oh, man. 
 Dad! 
 Amy! No! 
 People have been pretty darn thoughtful. 
 And generous. 
 We have enough food to last for weeks. 
 Have you seen Amy this morning? 
 I think she went for a ride. 
 Good. That's good. 
 Well, I'm just glad Mallory's not here to go through this, although she did try to use it as an excuse to get out of school. 
 I don't know. It just happened so fast and... 
 That could have been you. 
 Yeah, well, it wasn't. 
 Come here. 
 It's okay. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 TY: Where you been? 
 Around. 
 What, are you not working? 
 Unh-unh. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You want me to cool him off and groom him for you? 
 Sure. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 It's Amy, right? 
 Yeah. 
 It's Callie. Callie Phillips. We met at the cattle drive. 
 Right. 
 I'm a friend of your dad's. 
 You want to go inside? 
 Sure. 
 Callie Phillips. 
 Jack. Hi. 
 Oh, it's so good to see you. 
 I just drove from Calgary. 
 No, not at all. 
 Appreciate you coming. 
 I don't understand how something like this can happen. 
 I just can't believe it. 
 We should all just settle down and get on with our lives. 
 It's not like it's the end of the world. 
 Grandpa, we all need to deal in our own way. 
 [Bell rings] 
 Oh. 
 Jack, am I ringing that loud enough? 
 'Cause it took you a while. 
 Is there any more of Maggie's chili? 
 Might be. 
 Love some. No hurry. 
 And I'm thirsty. So, maybe a cup of coffee. 
 If it's fresh. Don't make a pot on my account. 
 Oh, and I'd love a piece of that apple pie. 
 Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack. 
 Do we have cheddar cheese? 
 Just a piece on the side if we do. 
 Just if we do. Thanks.

 Here. 
 No. 
 Amy, you haven't helped me once. It's your turn. 
 I'll take it. I'd like to surprise him. 
 Just down the hall to the right. 
 Okay. 
 Why is she here? 
 She sold Big River Ranch to him. 
 They must have kept in touch. 
 She did more than that. 
 She was flirting up a storm with him on the cattle drive. 
 Well, I mean, he hasn't mentioned her since. 
 Maybe they're friends. 
 I just hope she doesn't plan on staying. 
 There's already one too many guests in this house as it is. 
 Grandpa, Dad had surgery four days ago. 
 You know he has to stay with us. 
 The doctor said he couldn't possibly cope on his own. 
 Did that doctor ever consider how I'd cope? 
 You know, Tim's been milking this bullet wound like a dairy farmer with 10 hands. 
 Where are you going? 
 Out. 
 Don't wait dinner for me. 
 Tell His Highness he can have my share. 
 Hey. 
 Well, hello. 
 Hello, cowboy. 
 Yeah. Right there. 
 Hello. 
 Oh, you poor guy. 
 Ow. 
 Poor you. 
 Yeah, I got to watch that. 
 What were you thinking, facing down a bunch of armed rustlers? 
 Yeah. No hero. 
 I lost practically my whole herd. 
 Except that stupid pair of longhorns. 
 Not even the bad guys wanted the longhorns. 
 60 head. Gone. 
 They'll track 'em down. 
 Oh, I don't know about that. 
 It's not exactly a crack city police force we got here. 
 Come on. Don't diss Hudson's finest. 
 Thanks for coming. It's good to see you. 
 I'm glad you feel that way. 
 I'm not exactly sure about the others. 
 They kind of acted like they didn't know who I was. 
 You did tell them about us, right? 
 Yeah, they're fine. 
 They're just not good with change. 
 What if she's his girlfriend? 
 Amy, calm down. 
 No, she must be his girlfriend. 
 I think he would have said something if he had a girlfriend. 
 Hey, Amy, that new horse arrived, the one that needs re-homing. 
 What horse? 
 Boxer. 
 Jack made all the arrangements. 
 Oh, great. And of course he's not here. 
 I'm just the messenger. 
 I wish everyone would just chill. 
 I mean, I know things are a little bent with Dad here, and now Callie, but I'm the one doing all the work in that area, so... 
 [Bell rings] 
 [Sighs] 
 There you are, Boxer. There you go. 
 Okay, I think I'm pushing off. 
 All right. 
 So, say good-bye nice. 
 Come here. 
 Are you coming over later? 
 I'll try. 
 Shut up. 
 Okay. Just don't bring this disgustingly filthy hat. 
 What's wrong with my hat? 
 Hey. 
 AMY: Hey. 
 Later, Ty. 
 Hi, boy. So you're Boxer, huh? 
 This guy's old, but he seems in pretty good shape. 
 How you doing? 
 Maybe Caleb knows someone who's looking for a horse. 
 You could ask him. 
 You know, he's acting a bit weird today. 
 Maybe you should give him a call. 
 Maybe. 
 Well, this was really lovely. Thanks. 
 I should probably go. 
 Go where? 
 I booked into a hotel. 
 No. No, no. Stay here. 
 I'm absolutely fine at the hotel. 
 Besides, they have a full house with you here. 
 No. We've probably got an extra cabin at the dude ranch. 
 Anybody checking in this week? 
 No, but... 
 So, there you go. Stay here. End of story. 
 Dad, you can't just shove Callie out into the dude ranch in the middle of nowhere by herself. 
 I mean, I'm used to it out there, but trust me... 
 So, she can stay in your room? 
 That's nice of you, Lou. 
 No, I'm not putting anybody out of their room. 
 You know what? It's fine. Yeah. 
 Are you sure? 
 Mmm-hmm. Yeah. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Why did you do that? Now she's staying here. 
 Amy, it's one night. Relax, okay. 
 What is this? 
 Nothing. It's nothing. 
 "The Lou/Mark Mix"? Are you kidding? 
 Is this a mix CD? This is a mix CD. 
 What, are we in high school? 
 Give it to me! 
 Are you guys going steady? 
 Shut up. 
 You can't be serious. 
 Maybe I am a bit serious. 
 Lou, this is so not you. 
 Well, that is not entirely a bad thing. 
 Anyway, I came in here to tell you, you don't have to move out to the dude ranch. 
 You can just stay in my room. 
 Thank you. 
 But you shouldn't have to move at all. 
 I mean, you didn't offer your room in the first place. 
 "I Shot The Sheriff'? 
 Okay, that's it. Give me that CD right now. 
 Give it back! 
 Be out in a minute. 
 Take your time. 
 We're out of toothpaste, just so you know. 
 Oh, look, it's the blanket grabber. 
 Yeah, says the bed hogger. 
 Whatever. I should have let you sleep at the dude ranch. 
 I ended up on the floor twice. 
 Oh, and your elbows are like little knives. 
 You know what? I'm the one covered in bruises. 
 Morning. 
 Good morning, everybody. 
 I hope you slept well. I had the best sleep. 
 Oh, coffee! 
 Thanks, Jack. 
 [Bell rings] 
 No, no, no, no, no. It's okay, Lou. I'll go. 
 Callie's here early. 
 Yeah, not really. 
 She never left. 
 So, Callie actually kicked Lou out of her own room last night, so I only got an hour of sleep. 
 It's so rude. She just invited herself. 
 Hey, Callie. 
 Hey. 
 I thought I might take out one of the horses, if that's all right? 
 Sure. 
 TY: Just give me a minute, and I'll saddle one up for you. 
 That'd be great, thanks. 
 TY: All right. 
 Morning, Amy. 
 Morning. 
 Nice one. 
 Shut up. 
 I'm so embarrassed. 
 Yeah, you always had a way with words. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Hey, boy. 
 How are you? 
 I don't think he's settling in too well. 
 What do you mean? 
 No water. Nothing. 
 Well, he's only been here for a day. 
 A day's a long time to go without water, Amy. 
 Maybe you should call the owner. 
 Do you have a number? 
 Yeah, right there. 
 Hi. Is Ruth there? 
 Oh, her father? 
 This is Amy Fleming calling about your daughter's horse, Boxer. 
 Oh, he's your horse? 
 Oh, well, see, I think Boxer's homesick. 
 No, he's just not really settling in. 
 I was hoping maybe you could come visit. 
 You don't drive? 
 That's okay. We could come get you. 
 Meadowbridge. Yeah, I know where that is. 
 Okay. Thanks for com... 
 He hung up. 
 Do you think you could go get him? 
 I've got to groom some of the other horses. 
 Here you go. 
 That's okay. 
 Hi, Mister... 
 Just call me Hank. 
 Hank. I'm Amy. I'm glad you could come. 
 Things have changed around here a bit. 
 Quite a bit. 
 Hank, Boxer's just in here. 
 Boxer? 
 Why, look at that. There you are. 
 I've been looking for you. 
 Where you been, eh? You're looking good. 
 Now, you wait here. 
 Just got to do a quick check on the others. 
 Hey, Thunder. 
 How's the boy? 
 And how's Clover? 
 Still as lazy as ever? 
 Sure you are. 
 See? They're all doing fine. 
 I... 
 You're a good girl. I know you're working hard. 
 We're doing the best we can. 
 But Boxer, I think he misses you. I mean, he's not eating. 
 That's what I really wanted to talk to you... 
 You don't need to worry about that, Ruth, like you always do. 
 Ruth here is a real worrywart. 
 No, I'm not Ruth. I'm Amy. 
 Who? 
 Oh, Daddy. Thank goodness you're all right. 
 Miss Adams? 
 What in God's name are you doing? 
 How could you take my father away without telling me? 
 Miss Adams, I had no idea that was even your horse. 
 I called because I had some questions about Boxer. 
 Your dad said he'd love to come visit. 
 He was waiting for me when I arrived. 
 He seemed pretty clear about what was going on. 
 My father has Alzheimer's. 
 He hasn't been clear about anything for years. 
 Mr. Bartlett. 
 Miss Adams. 
 It's good to see you. 
 Miss Adams, please try and understand. 
 I was just trying to do the right thing. 
 Boxer wasn't even eating. 
 I'm Jack. 
 I'm Amy's grandfather. 
 Hank Adams. 
 Well, it's nice to meet you, Hank. 
 I believe we've met. 
 Is that so? 
 Daddy, come on. 
 What's your hurry? 
 I need to see Boxer. 
 Boxer is fine. I need to get you home. 
 My father will not be visiting anymore, under any circumstances, understand? 
 We'll talk. 
 What was that all about? 
 Why don't you tell me? 
 She called right after the accident, and I guess it just slipped my mind. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Great. 
 A teacher who already hates me at school now hates me even more because apparently I kidnapped her father. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't think it would be an issue. 
 Oh, she's a hard nut, that teacher of yours. 
 Would it kill her to let her father see his own horse once in a while? 
 How can she keep him from the one thing that actually still means something to him? 
 Now, there's always two sides to a story. 
 Boxer totally recognized Hank. 
 He perked right up when he saw him. 
 I mean, what if she won't let him visit? 
 He's not gonna eat. How am I supposed to re-home him? 
 He'll come around eventually. 
 You know, Hank thought I was Miss Adams. 
 But he totally recognized Boxer. 
 How can he be confused about his own daughter but not his horse? 
 That's so weird. 
 You know what else is weird? 
 He said we'd met, and I think he might be right. 
 His name's familiar. 
 I just wish I could remember where I know him from. 
 Oh, come on. There's some things you just plain forget. 
 So I convinced him he's strong enough to go for a walk. 
 And then there's some things you just want to forget. 
 Grandpa. 
 [Bell rings] 
 Yes, Dad? 
 Oh, Lou. I'd love some tea. 
 Dad, you know, that bullet went through your shoulder, not your legs. 
 It's just a few steps to the kitchen. 
 Where's Callie? 
 She went to check on things at the ranch. 
 Hey, so, um... 
 So, what's the deal with you two? 
 No deal. 
 Nothing for you to worry about. 
 What about that sister of yours? What's up with her? 
 I barely see her. 
 I don't know. She's... 
 She's going through some stuff. 
 You should talk to her. 
 I'd like to. 
 Just ring that bell. 
 Come on, come on! 
 Come on, Ty. I have something for you. 
 What? 
 It's a present. 
 Wow. 
 This one has got to go, though. 
 Hey, hey. I love this hat. 
 Oh, come on. It looks like a horse stomped on it. 
 It's fit for the garbage. 
 Hey, am I right, Amy? 
 This one is so going, isn't it? 
 No way. 
 Hey, come on, Ty. It's just a hat. 
 No, it's not just a hat. 
 Me and this hat have been through a lot together. 
 Okay. Well, too bad. 
 It's time for a new one, cowboy. 
 See? Looks good, doesn't it? 
 Yeah. Yeah, pretty sharp. 
 Hey, I heard you got your license. That's awesome. 
 Thanks. 
 [Starts engine] 
 Ease up on the starter, Amy. 
 I got it. 
 Have you talked to Caleb yet? Work's piling up. 
 Yeah. It really looks like you've got your hands full. 
 Where have you been? 
 Nowhere. 
 Why haven't you been at work, then? 
 Been down with a cold. 
 Oh, right. And like that's ever stopped you before. 
 Is this where you live? 
 Don't go in there. It's a disaster. 
 Amy, no! 
 And... 
 What did this used to be? 
 Well, whatever it is, it wasn't bad... at the time. 
 That's gross. 
 Look, Amy, I've been meaning to talk to you. 
 Caleb, you all right? 
 Of course I am. 
 Well, what's going on, then? 
 Nothing's going on. 
 You're a terrible liar. 
 Actually, I'm known for my poker face. 
 When are you coming back to work? 
 I don't know, 'Cause Ty and I, we can't handle everything by ourselves. 
 Amy, I'm just not sure it's such a good idea. 
 Last time I checked, you worked for us. 
 Is this you quitting? 
 Fine. 
 Look, I'm no quitter. 
 Is your dad still at home? 
 Yeah. So? 
 It's just I'm not sure I can face him. 
 I mean, when I was a kid, he was the guy. 
 He was my hero. 
 Up on that hill, I felt like such an idiot. 
 Like a sitting duck. I just let it happen. 
 Tim Fleming got hurt on my watch. 
 Heck, he nearly got killed on my watch. 
 It's not your fault. 
 How do you think I feel, hmm? 
 I was just... 
 Look, if I hadn't... 
 Just come back to work, okay? 
 We need you. 
 See you. 
 
 
 
 ♪  When the time comes at last...  ♪ 
 Don't stop. 
 Haven't heard you play for a long time. 
 That's a good thing. I can embarrass even myself. 
 I can't remember half the chords. 
 I love this song. I haven't heard it in forever. 
 Your grandma could sing. That's for sure. 
 I did finally figure out one thing. 
 I remember how I know Hank Adams. 
 Oh, that's a relief. 
 Your grandma had a group of musicians who played backup for her. 
 And her favorite was a young guy. 
 Played lead guitar. 
 Named Hank Adams. 
 That's Hank right there. 
 [Guitar plays] 
 Hank played with your grandma's band for a year or so. 
 And then his dad just dropped dead from a heart attack, so Hank found himself in charge of the family dairy farm. 
 Pretty big responsibility. So, his music had to go. 
 A dairy farm, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Meadowbridge. Pretty big operation. 
 And I bet Hank and Boxer bossed those cows every day since he took it on. 
 I don't expect he's still running it now.

 What? 
 Well, a girl makes you a mix CD. I mean, it's pretty serious. 
 Well, I don't just make them for anyone. 
 And this one is you specific. 
 It's got "I Fought the Law and the Law Won," 
 "Roxanne" by the Police. 
 "I Shot the Sheriff." 
 Yeah. You can listen to it on the way to a shake-up. 
 Or a shake-down. Or whatever. 
 Have I told you you're cute? 
 Nope. 
 Well, you are. 
 You're crazy, but cute. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Right. Okay. Business. 
 Business. Yes. 
 You said you had an update. Good news? 
 No, it's not great. 
 There's no trace? 
 No. There's a list a mile long of slaughterhouses who don't ask enough questions. 
 I can't believe the incompetence. 
 The RCMP is doing all we can do. 
 Yeah? What are you doing exactly? 
 Dad. 
 We're following every lead. 
 We're on the lookout for the vehicles used. 
 Oh, so you're on it. 
 Look, I have a bit of an issue with how you handled things. 
 You got yourself involved in a direct confrontation. 
 It's a miracle more people weren't hurt. 
 You are lucky we didn't arrest you for taking the law into your own hands. 
 Yeah, me and all the ranchers who lost their shirts. 
 Why don't we all go to jail? 
 Go ahead, arrest us. 
 Dad. 
 No, the victims are the ones that should be in jail. 
 I mean, we'd be easier to catch. 
 Excuse me. 
 Mark. 
 Mark, that was a bit over the top, don't you think? 
 Arrest him? My dad almost died. 
 Hey, you know, I've been dealing with a lot of these ranchers, and they all act like the RCMP should be their own personal cow bodyguard. 
 So, I'm sorry. 
 Look, it's okay. 
 I can imagine what you're up against. 
 Would you just come here? 
 Don't be mad at me. I'm not the crazy vigilante here. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I'm on duty. 
 If I don't go now, I'm not going at all. 
 Then, don't. 
 You should behave yourself. 
 Or what? You're gonna arrest me? 
 All right. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, what do you mean tomorrow? 
 Lunch reservations at the Banff Springs, remember? 
 2:00? 
 Oh, oh, geez. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 Look, I have a provincial review meeting in Edmonton tomorrow. 
 Lou, I totally forgot. I'm so sorry. 
 Okay. 
 Listen... I'm gonna make up to you, I am gonna call you the second I get back. 
 We're gonna go out for a nice dinner or a long drive somewhere, and we're gonna listen to that CD of yours. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 See you. 
 Okay. 
 I'll call you. 
 All right. 
 Bye. 
 I got to be careful. 
 He's growing on me. 
 Hey, what's wrong? 
 Is it true they're not gonna get Dad's cows back? 
 Doesn't look like it. 
 It's all my fault. 
 Amy. 
 Well, it is. 
 You know, if I hadn't have been there, none of this would have happened. 
 Amy, stop. 
 It's my fault, Lou! 
 It's just so stupid! 
 You know, I follow Ty and Caleb, and everything gets messed up. 
 Lou, Dad was shot because of me. 
 Amy, that is ridiculous. 
 Who knows how it was gonna turn out with or without you there? 
 Either way, it wasn't gonna be good, okay? 
 Listen to me. You need to talk to Dad. 
 You'll feel better. 
 Just can't get comfortable. 
 That's because you get yourself so worked up. 
 Now the blanket's gonna fall off on this side. 
 Fine. 
 [Laughter] 
 Dad? 
 Oh. 
 Amy. 
 Amy, Boxer's gone. 
 Boxer? 
 Hey, boy. 
 Now, you had us all worried. 
 Yes, you did. 
 You like the cows, don't you? 
 Of course you do. You worked on a dairy farm. 
 You miss it? 
 At least he's eating again. 
 Those cows really made his day. 
 Look at this. 
 He absolutely let himself out. 
 I'm gonna add another bolt. 
 Ms. Adams should have told us he could do stunts like this. 
 You really don't like her much, do you? 
 The feeling's mutual. I've got grades to prove it. 
 Come on, Amy. She can't hold it against you. 
 Yeah, 'cause teachers really love it when you pry into their private lives. 
 Look, this horse needs help. That's the bottom line, all right? 
 Regardless of the owner. 
 Can you smell them? 
 Yeah, you do. 
 Attaboy. Let's go get them. 
 Hey, Jack. 
 What do you need? 
 Food? Reading material? A sponge bath? 
 That's funny. 
 No, I just wanted to thank you for letting me stay here. 
 Don't mention it. 
 But I'm thinking of going back to Big River Ranch. 
 Well, Callie's taken some time off so she can help me. 
 I should be okay. 
 I just don't want it to insult your hospitality. 
 No. Not at all. 
 Not at all. 
 So, I hear you're leaving. 
 Yeah. It's gonna be nice to spend some time at the ranch. 
 Plus, I'll be out of your hair. 
 I'm really sorry if I was in the way. 
 No, no. Not at all. 
 Let me get this straight. Are you living with my dad? 
 No, I still have my place in Calgary, but... 
 Well, you know, when I'm here. 
 Really? 
 Okay, I just have to ask this. Why do you all dislike me so much? 
 No, Callie, look. We don't dislike you. 
 I don't even know you. 
 But you knew I've been seeing your father ever since the cattle drive. 
 No, I didn't. 
 So, I'm sorry if... 
 He didn't tell you? 
 No, he didn't say a word. 
 So, you have to understand this has been a bit of a surprise for all of us, and... 
 Right. 
 I mean, forgive us if we didn't exactly, you know, embrace it. 
 Well, I totally understand now. 
 I'll see you later. 
 Good one, Dad. 
 Do you have you any idea how stupid I feel? 
 Callie, shh. 
 What? 
 Don't make such a big... 
 What? Big deal? 
 I thought it was a big deal, Tim. I thought I meant something to you. 
 But apparently not, because nobody even knows about me. 
 That's not true. 
 Now, you know that I didn't want to involve my daughters in this. 
 Not yet. You have to understand that. 
 I don't understand it, Tim. I don't understand it at all. 
 I'm gonna drive back to Calgary. 
 The hell with you and your stupid bullet wound. 
 Callie! 
 Callie, wait. 
 Mmm-mmm. 
 Wait. We'll talk about this back at the ranch. 
 It's just hard with all these people around. 
 What, all these people? 
 It's hard on you putting up with us? 
 I'll just give her some time to cool down. 
 Hey, you're not going with her? 
 Go with her! 
 We get in his way? 
 He has a hard time dealing with us? 
 I have had it, Lou. He has got to go! 
 Grandpa, breathe. 
 [Loud rock music plays] 
 Hang on a second. 
 Lou. Lou. 
 Have a good trip to Edmonton? 
 Lou, just hang on. 
 Do not apologize to me. 
 Apologize? Why would I apologize? 
 Now, what exactly would I apologize for? 
 Gee, I don't know. Maybe because you lied to me? 
 Maybe because there's another woman in your truck? 
 Maybe because you're making out with her to our mix CD? 
 Just hang on. Whoa, whoa. 
 Now, look, Lou. 
 We go out. We have fun together. 
 But we're not together together. 
 I mean, I'm seeing other people. You're seeing other people, right? 
 Oh. 
 Lou? 
 Lou, are you awake? 
 Yeah. I am now. 
 What? 
 Hey. 
 What is it? 
 Can we talk? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, of course. Come here. 
 What's wrong? 
 I can't breathe. 
 Amy. 
 It's Dad. 
 I feel so guilty. 
 Amy, we already talked about this. It wasn't your fault. 
 We had this big fight right before. 
 And I can't say I'm sorry. I can't even talk to him. 
 Sweetie, you will. 
 I don't know, Lou. 
 I mean, I can't even seem to get close to him. 
 And now he's got a girlfriend, and... he just keeps moving farther away. 
 I don't know. I'm afraid to get close to anyone. 
 Every time I do, I end up losing them. 
 No, you don't. 
 Yes, I do. Look at Ty. 
 He knows me better than anyone, and... 
 I just let him go. 
 Now he's got Kit. 
 She's over all the time. 
 And... 
 Caleb kissed me. 
 It's just all messed up. 
 Boys suck. 
 Remember how I was supposed to go to Banff with Mark? 
 Yeah. 
 I saw him in town with another girl. 
 Lou. 
 I lost it on him. 
 It's so over. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Just as I was really starting to like him, you know? 
 Maybe more than like him. 
 Well, he wasn't good enough for you, anyway. 
 Thanks. 
 Anyway, it was a rebound from the start, right? 
 I fell way too hard too soon. 
 Be careful about that rebound thing. 
 I will. 
 Yeah? What about Caleb? 
 What about Caleb? 
 He kissed you. Don't you want to know why? 
 Shut up. 
 You shut up. 
 [Knocking at door] 
 There's someone to see you. 
 I would like to talk to you. 
 Sure. 
 My father's with Ty, visiting Boxer. 
 I wanted to... 
 ...apologize. 
 I shouldn't have brought your father here without asking more questions. 
 I am so sorry. 
 You had no way of knowing. 
 You know, that little visit... 
 He remembers every bit of it. Totally. 
 It meant a lot to him. 
 Your father's thoughts might be muddled, but his memories are... 
 I don't know... true. 
 Yeah. 
 There's something pretty important in that. 
 It must be hard, what's happening to him. 
 It's a horrible thing, this disease. 
 Do you have someone who can help you? 
 No, not really. 
 My mother died when I was 17. 
 And I couldn't leave my father, not after everything he'd done for me. 
 So, I never got married or had... 
 He's all I have, Amy. 
 And he's fading away. 
 I'm losing him. 
 He's still here. 
 And he remembers things. 
 He remembers Boxer, and Boxer remembers him, too. 
 Boxer may just be a horse, but he devoted his life to Hank, just like you. 
 Maybe they deserve every chance they can to be together. 
 How about that guy, huh? Chasing cows at his age? 
 He's still got it, Hank. 
 Bartlett. 
 Jack. 
 I haven't seen you in years. 
 Come on up to the house, Hank. I want you to hear something. 
 Hey, Amy. You did good. 
 Thanks.

 Thank you, Amy. I appreciate your patience.

 [Knocking on door] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I'm sorry about Callie. 
 I hope you guys are okay. 
 Dad, you should call her. Don't just let her go. 
 She makes you happy, right? 
 Yeah, she does. 
 Maybe I should just wait. 
 She'll come back, you know? 
 'Cause of my obvious charm. 
 I'd call her. 
 Okay, I'll call her. 
 What? 
 Hey, what's the matter? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Sorry for what? 
 It's because of me that you got hurt. 
 No, honey, honey. 
 No, don't go there. 
 No, I was a damn fool to do what I did. 
 What if you had been killed? 
 Yeah, but I wasn't. 
 I'm right here. I'm always gonna be right next door. 
 That's why I bought that damn ranch. 
 It wasn't just for those longhorns. 
 Come on. You better help me pack. 
 Your grandpa's gonna come after me with another gun if I don't get out of here. 
 Probably. 
 Seen your sister? 
 Lou's supposed to give me a ride home. 
 Dad, you don't have to go. 
 Oh, yes, I do. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Grandpa. 
 Jack. 
 Callie, I'm sorry. 
 Please call. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Just... 
 Hi. 
 I thought message number nine was particularly good. 
 I'm willing to give this another shot on a couple of conditions. 
 Oh! 
 Sorry. 
 That hat does look good on you. 
 I was kind of used to the other one. 
 You'll get used to this one. 
 So, I tried to call your phone, but it was dead. 
 Yeah, I forgot to pay the bill. 
 Great. 
 So, when are you coming back to work? 
 Tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 But you didn't come out here to ask me that. 
 You're right. 
 Caleb, you kissed me. Why? 
 Why? 
 Does there have to be a reason? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, there does. I mean... 
 Why did you do it? What does it mean? 
 It means anything you want it to. 
 No, I am so sick and tired of mixed messages. 
 I'm tired of not knowing where people stand. 
 Okay. Fine. I'll be straight with you. 
 Ty and Kit are happy. 
 And I know you need some time to get used to it, but they are. 
 But you know what I think? 
 I think he gave up on you pretty easy. 
 When I love a girl, you won't see me doing that. 
 Giving up? 
 I fight for her. I go down fighting for her. 
 You're nuts. 
 Yes, I am. 
 You get your butt back to work tomorrow.
