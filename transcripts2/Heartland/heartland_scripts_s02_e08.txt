 Ty: Previously on "Heartland": 
 Oh my God! 
 Uh... 
 Hey. 
 (Laughs) 
 How dare you bring that stable hand here and talk about your trailer trash pursuits at my club! 
 I'll stop talking about it... 
 As long as I get to keep Apollo. 
 I will not be blackmailed. 
 That is quite the situation you got yourself into. 
 Were you living in that place? 
 With your dad? 
 Yeah. 
 I can see that worked out well. 
 (Exhales forcefully) 
 It's like a million degrees in here. 
 Did you open up all the windows? 
 Every single one. 
 (Sighs) 
 It's too hot to sleep. 
 It's too hot to move. It's too hot to breathe. 
 Lemonade? 
 Yeah. Yeah, that's what I need - a sugar rush at two in the morning. 
 Well, apparently, it's not too hot to be sarcastic. 
 (Fan clunks) 
 (Chuckles softly) 
 (Wolf howls in the distance) 
 (Slow, heavy of footfalls) 
 (Ty roars, Mallory screams) 
 Ty: (Laughs) Ow! 
 You're such a boy! 
 That's a pretty nice right hook. 
 Who knew you were such a scrapper? 
 I've seen "Million Dollar Baby" twice. 
 What're you doing out here anyway? It's the middle of the night. 
 I refuse to go back into the house until Jack gets an air conditioner. 
 Do you hear that? 
 (Low rumble of approaching truck) 
 (Truck rumbles up driveway) 
 You guys expecting company? 
 (Truck tires crunch over gravel) 
 (Truck door opens) 
 (Door clunks shut) 
 Dad? 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I need your help, Ty. 
 I think you took a wrong turn. 
 The highway's back the way you came. 
 I didn't know where else to go. 
 You can go to hell for all I care. 
 I got animals in the back. 
 They're not doing very well in this heat. 
 What kind of animals? 
 Horses. 
 No, you can't have horses in a cattle truck! 
 My boss didn't give me any choice. 
 I didn't realize they were sick until I got to a gas station. 
 I knew you were working here, so I thought maybe... 
 Amy: (Coughs) 
 Ty, Amy and Mallory: (Coughing) 
 Amy: Give me the flashlight. 
 Ty: Here. 
 Lou: Mallory, go inside. 
 Wake up grampa. 
 (Horse nickering) 
 (Horse nickers) 
 Oh my God. 
 (Horse grunts) 
 Lou: Here. 
 Jack: Go back inside, Mallory. But Jack... Go back inside. How many more are in there? Amy: There's just one. But she's lying down. Lou, take those horses to the paddock and make sure they get some water. Lou: I called Scott. He's driving back from Red Deer, but he probably won't be here till morning. (Calming horse) 
Shhhh... Shhhh... (Horse snuffles) She hit her head pretty bad. These pot trucks are too low for horses. They lose their balance. Then they get trampled. I'm so sorry, girl. Ty: Amy... We should concentrate on the other horses. Come on. Jack: He's right. I know it's the last thing you wanna hear, but we gotta move on. Ty: Come on, Amy. Come on. (Horse snuffles) Amy: Grandpa! Grandpa, no! Amy, there's nothing anyone can do for that horse and you know it. Grandpa, Scott's gonna be here in the morning. She's in a lot of pain now and she won't make it till morning. Do you really want her to suffer until then? Grandpa, please. Please. (Jack cocks rifle) (Heavy footfalls on ramp) (Resounding gunshot) ♪ 
♪ ♪ And at the break of day you sank into... ♪ 
♪ your dream ♪ 
♪ you dreamer. ♪ 
♪ Oh, oh, oh... ♪ 
♪ You dreamer ♪ 
♪ you dreamer ♪ So, it turns out Ty's dad was telling the truth. He picked up the horses at a livestock auction house near Spencerville. Scott: Where was he taking them? Um... It just says DRC Exports. Have you ever heard of it? Scott: Yeah. It's a slaughterhouse up north. It was a meat truck? I overheard Brad on the phone with his boss. He's supposed to make the delivery as soon as the horses recover. He can't do that, Lou. These horses were put on a cattle truck. That's gotta be illegal. I don't think it is, Amy. We have to do something. I'll file a report with the RCMP,  but I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. I'm gonna call Rodriguez. Caleb: Sounds like a whole lot of trouble for a bunch of horses on a one way trip. How can you say that? Sorry. I don't mean to sound cold, but this type of thing happens all the time. Doesn't make it right. (Unintelligible conversation) Want me to kick him off? No. You sure? Yeah. 'Cause I got some experience in that department. I think, this is something I have to do on my own. Jack: I get that. Just, uh, remember one thing for me. Just 'cause you hope someone's gonna change doesn't mean he will. I know. (Unintelligible chatter) Ashley: You have got to be kidding me. An economy car?! You're lucky you have a car at all. You expect me to be seen in public driving that? My expectations of you, my dear, these days are pretty low. When'd you start golfing anyway? Since the lounge at the country club started selling fishbowl margaritas. Plus the bartender looks like Johnny Depp. Is that supposed to be funny, Ashley? I'm not even smiling. Oh, mother, you haven't smiled since the Botox. I want you back here by four. I've got a group of Japanese investors touring the stables, and I want them to meet you. Oh... not again. It's too hot to pretend to be a happy family. Ashley, I just took away your BMW, do you want me to take away your allowance too? (Horn beeps) (Ignition turns) Easy... easy... What did the vet say? These guys are gonna be fine. The two in the barn are pretty sick though. I didn't mean to cause all this trouble. Yeah, you never do. I've been driving cattle trucks for a few months. Never had to load horses before. It's too bad, 'cause it was a pretty good job up 'til now. Yeah, a job where you're always leaving - you must be pretty good at it. I know you're angry, Ty. Things just got really bad in Calgary. I had to get outta there. Yeah. No kidding. Those guys you owed money to? They found me. What do you mean they found you? I mean, they were looking for a face to smash in and they didn't much care if it was yours or mine. Ty, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I mean... I swear. I never would've left if I thought you were in danger. You're so full of crap! You know that?! You left and I got beat up. How is that any different than when I was a kid? Okay, that's not fair! That was a long time ago. And I thought you and your mom would be better off without me. Well, you were wrong. You know, I hope it keeps you up at night thinking about her and that guy she married - what he did to her... And to me. I can't change what happened. But things are different now. Hey, I could've taken those horses to the slaughterhouse, got my fee, nobody would've known any different. I did the right thing. So, what do you want, a medal? No. No, I want you to know... I need you to know that I wanna do the right thing here. I'm not just talking about the horses. I'm not buying it, dad. Not this time. (Screen door bangs shut) Jack: Are looking for something? (Sighs) I wouldn't have to resort to such drastic measures if- Jack: Ah! If you'd just get an air conditioner. I've lived here all my life, I've never needed one. If you're hot- I know. Go outside. That's right. Outside where I'll get sunstroke and eaten alive by mosquitoes. Well, you could always go swimming in the pond; That'd cool you right off. Really, Jack? Sure. So long as you don't mind the leeches; They're pretty bad this time of year. If I ever catch you holding that fridge door open again, I will throw you in that pond myself. (Screen door shuts) Amy: You know, it's weird. This is a warm-blood. So? Amy: I don't know, I... Think I've treated this horse before or something. That's impossible. Why's that? 'Cause there's no way a horse you treated would end up on a meat truck. I hope you're right. (Bucket of water sloshes) (Horse nickers) Apollo? What was that? This is Ashley's horse. (Water sloshes) (Relieved sigh) 
That's what I'm talking about. Sorry the lemonade isn't very cold. I, um, could've sworn I bought three bags of ice yesterday. Well, that might explain why I just saw a short, blonde girl stealing ice from the freezer. (Half laughs) Mallory. I should've known. I could arrest her if you wanted. No. No, I'm serious. These things are a slippery slope. I should know. Couple nights in the county jail might set her straight. No, don't do that. I would feel sorry for the other inmates. A few nights with Mallory and they'd be begging for solitary confinement. Both: (Laugh) That's good. Good. Yeah. 
(Clears throat) So, what're you doing Friday night? Friday- 
Friday night? Yeah. Assuming there are no horse emergencies, thefts, or, uh, dude ranch guests gone wild. Both: (Laugh) Um... Scott! Hi. Uh, do you know Mark? Constable Rodriguez? Uh, no, I don't think we've met. You must be the vet. Yeah. That's me. The vet. Rodriguez: Well, a lot of people are calling for a ban on transporting horses in pot trucks,  but it's not illegal. At least not in Alberta. They were so dehydrated. Those horses were sick long before they got on that truck. Well, that's gonna be hard to prove. Well, did you go check out the auction house? Yeah. Yeah, I stopped by on the way over. It's uh... It's not a pretty place, but I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. So you're saying there's nothing we can do to save those horses? Not unless you own them. You mean, buy them from the auction house? Yeah, usually these places only sell to slaughterhouses as a last resort. So, uh... If you talked to them, you might be able to work out a deal. Well, uh... I should get going. If you have any questions, you've got my number. I'm sure she does. Lou:  Thanks for stopping by, Constable. Yeah. Thanks for the lemonade. I'll see myself out. (Clears her throat) Ashley: (Crying) Why would my mother do this? (Sniffles) It's all my fault. If I hadn't stopped jumping... (Teary breaths) I'm so sorry, boy. I'm so sorry. 
(Cries) I'm so sorry. I mean, I guess we could use a few of 'em for trail rides. We'd have to re-home the rest of them. I don't know. It's a big decision. Whatever you decide to do, after we're done with these horses, I think you should find another vet. What?! (Sighs) We've both gotta move on, Lou. (Dumfounded breath) (Water sprays forcefully) Rodriguez: This your truck? Brad: Yeah. Those horses look sick before you loaded them? It was pretty dark. I didn't really get a good look at 'em till after I left. When I saw that one horse lying on the floor there, I got here as fast as I could. Mm-hm. Well, there's gotta be about a dozen ranches between here and the highway. Why Heartland? I didn't do anything wrong. Maybe. Maybe not. When a guy drives through town with a record as long as yours, I'm not about to give him the benefit of the doubt. I'd rather he just kept on driving. Do I make myself clear? Yeah. You missed a spot. (Horse nickers) (Banging on door) Come on, Mallory. I need to shower. Mallory: I'll be out in a minute. Hey, there you are. I'm heading into town. You need anything? Mallory: Tell Ty to pick up some more ice. Did you get that? Yes, Mallory! Hey, I saw Ashley in the barn. I can't believe that's Apollo. I know. She's been with him all morning. Ty: Val Stanton is some mom. Hey, Ty? Speaking of parents, how's it going with your dad? I don't know. He's all "let's try again, I'm a new man." But I've heard that one before. How did he know you were here anyway? I wrote him after I moved back. I shouldn't have, but I guess I just wanted him to care. It was stupid, but... It's not stupid. Hey, he wouldn't be here if he didn't care. Doesn't matter. As far as I'm concerned, as soon as we're done with those horses, me and my dad? We're done too. Amy? Amy. Ashley? What are you doing here? Amy didn't tell you? Tell me what? It's Apollo. Oh my God... You'll help him, right? That's what you do here at Heartland, you...you save horses. I'm gonna call your mom. No! You can't do that. She's the one that sold Apollo. (Horse nickers, Ashley sniffles) Lou, please... Don't let him go to the slaughterhouse. Please... What're you doing? Well, I'm dying to see this Hudson place. Well, you can find your own ride then. Come on, Ty. Show me where you hang out: Your high school... My high school? Yeah. You're kidding right? Back in Calgary, you said you wanted to go back to school. Yeah, well, things change. Now get out. (Sighs) I won't bother you. All right? You won't even know I'm here, I swear. Whatever. I love small towns, you know. I remember one time... 
(Loud rock music blares) You wanna buy who? Apollo. He was one of the horses on the truck that stopped at Heartland. I think we've already sold that horse. Yeah, I know. To a slaughterhouse. I'll get the manager. It amazes me you people can sleep at night. So you wanna buy Apollo, huh? Actually, I wanna buy the whole truckload. Ed: (Sleazy chuckle) You're... You're a regular mother Teresa, aren't ya? Look, I will, uh... I'll match whatever the slaughterhouse paid you. Agh. No good. I want double. Really? Yeah. Two grand oughta do the trick, and I only take cash. Number's on the card. You give me a call when you got the money. Dad, come on. Let's go. Ah, why don't we stay for a bit? Get ourselves a cold drink. I need to get back. Come on, sit down. Order whatever you want. It's on me. Not hungry. Hey. (Chuckles) Who's that? Ah, that's nobody. That's just a girl I know. Well, don't be rude. Invite her over. Dad, what're you doing? What, are you afraid your old man's gonna embarrass you? Too late for that. 
 
 Hey, Ty. Hey. (Awkward half laugh) Well, I'd wait for Ty to introduce me,  but he's a little tongue-tied right now. I'm his dad, Brad Borden. One-half the reason why he's so good looking. (With a laugh) 
Oh. Uh, Kit Bailey. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Borden. We were just about to order ourselves a couple of cold drinks. Why don't you join us? Uh, dad, I think she's got better things to do. Uh, no, actually, I was just heading for some ice cream; Might as well eat it with you guys. There you go. All right. Val: Ashley, right on time. Uh, gentlemen, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Ashley Stanton. Ashley?! What're you do... Ashley?! Ashley, don't! 
(Stunned gasp) (Glass shatters) What the hell do you think you're doing?! Ashley: That's for making me drive an economy car. Ashley, don't you... Nooo! (Glass shatters, Val yelps, stunned) And that's for what you did to Apollo! Konnichiwa. Amy found Apollo on a meat truck! Don't blame me. I sold him to a reputable horse dealer. What happened after that's not my fault. Buy him back! Oh, I'll do no such thing. Fine. Then first thing in the morning, I'm moving out. Like hell you are. Yeah, that's right, mom. I'm leaving you just like everybody else! What?! Yeah. Jesse couldn't wait to go to boarding school so he wouldn't have to deal with your crap. And dad? Well, he would've left you too, if he hadn't died first. (Hard smack, Ashley gasps) (Stifles a sob) If you leave here, don't you expect a penny from me. Your allowance, your credit car... 
(Stifles a sob) I'll cut you off, Ashley. I hope you and your horses will be happy together. (Whispering) 
All right, he's gone. Now's your chance to escape. (Chuckles) Your dad's not so bad. Yeah. It's actually starting to weird me out. I keep waiting for him to ask for like kidney or something. Both: (Laugh) You know, I'm kinda glad that he asked me to join you. Really? Mm-hm. After the rodeo, I was sort of hoping you would call me. You never gave me your number. (Phone keypad beeps) There. Now I have. So no more lame excuses. Tell your dad I said thanks. (Sighs) You're welcome. Amy: That's great, Lou! And where exactly do you plan on putting all these horses? We'll make room. Don't look at me like that grandpa. The dude ranch has been picking up and we need more horses for trail rides. I see. So it was purely a business decision. Brad: (Clears throat) Well, I think it's great, Lou. That was one delivery I was not looking forward to making. Mallory: So, Brad. Ty hasn't talked very much about you. All I've heard is you're good at making things disappear. Amy: Mallory... You wanna see a trick? It's okay, dad. I think everyone's pretty tired. Nah, come on. I want to see a trick. Yeah? Your average everyday handkerchief. All right? Ty used to love this trick when he was a kid. He used to think I was some kind of magician. Now, what we do is we stuff that down in there. All right? Now... I need you to blow on that. It's not bad, if you're a five-year-old at a birthday party. Really? Check your pocket. Yeah, right. No way! Amy, Mallory and Brad: (Chuckling) Ty: I can't believe she bought them. Amy: Deep down, Lou's just a big marshmallow. Ty: Who would've ever thought you'd end up owning Ashley Stanton's horse? Amy: (Laughs) It's been a weird day. You're telling me. I spent the whole day with my dad. And that's not even the weird part. What was? It was kind of okay. Sometimes people surprise us, even when we've given up on them. You really believe that? Yeah. I really do. I should probably... Yeah, me too. Good night. (Sighs) Hey, there, pretty girl. You're looking a lot better. Sorry about the rough ride earlier, but everything's gonna be okay now. So, I guess I saved them, didn't I? Yeah, well, don't let it go to your head. They're gonna need names now, right? The warm-blood one's Apollo. But she doesn't have a name yet. Well... What about... Lily? I don't think mom would like the idea of a... Horse being named after her. You know, I wish I could've been there for her, Ty. I really do. And you're right, it does keep me up at night... Thinking about what I could've done different, thinking about you. That's why I don't sleep anymore. I just drive. Ah, whatever. You don't wanna name the horse Lily, I understand. No. It's a good name. Ty, I don't expect you to forgive me, but I do hope I can be part of your life again. I'm making, uh, a run down to the States in a couple of weeks. Why don't you come with me? You know, get a chance to see the Grand Canyon. (Chuckles softly) Uh... I don't know. I um... Ah, you don't have to decide now. Just uh... Promise me you'll think about it. Yeah, yeah. Look, how'd you get my number anyway? No, I haven't forgotten. I just need a few more days. You'll get your money. Yes, all of it. Fine. Oh... Jack. Uh... What ya doin' up? I could ask you the same thing. (Nervous breath) Work stuff. My boss is a real hard-ass. Nothing I can't handle... You know. 'Night, Jack. I hope... Whatever problems you're having at "work" don't become Ty's problems. Yeah. Look, I understand your concern, Jack, but I got... I got everything under control. You better. 'Cause I've got 600 acres of land, a shovel, and you've already seen my work with a rifle. Believe me, you do not want to get on my bad side. Thanks, Amy. I'm so relieved. I'll be right over. Okay. Bye. Soraya! Put on your fast pants on. I don't have all day! Declined. That's impossible. Look, you made a mistake. Try it again. I ran it through twice already. Soraya! Look, you didn't have to do that. I'll pay you tomorrow. Tomorrow's a long time from now, Ashley. Meanwhile, I've got a full diner, no help, and loads of dirty dishes piling up in the kitchen. (Incredulous breath) You want me to... (Stunned) 
Wash the dishes? You can start with this one. Thank you. (Water sprays) I'd give anything for a snow cone. Uh, I'd give anything for ice cream. I'd give anything for January. Yeah, and I'd give anything for ear plugs. Somebody's cranky. Yeah, you're damn right I'm cranky! Six more horses means six times as much work. Ty: Nice math, genius. Caleb: (Forced laughter) Coming from the guy that didn't graduate high school. Caleb! Well... Mallory: Is it just me, or is Caleb not smelling so  Odell-icious  these days. Ty: I think you're right, Mallory. Something does stink. Amy: Hey! Hey, guys! Ty and Caleb: (Gasp) Oh! Amy: Come on, there's more where this came from. Caleb: Oh, it's on, Flemmy. No! No! All: (Playful shouts and screams) (Laughing and shouting) Ty: Take the hose! Caleb: Ohhh! (Playful laughter) Mallory: (Squeals) Ty: (Playful scream turns into laughter) ♪ Oh, oh, ordinary day ♪ Yes, I have the money. No. No, I don't think it would be appropriate to do it over lunch. Fine then, stop by the ranch tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Bye. (Disgusted shudder) You know, I've been thinking about what you said about... Seeing the Grand Canyon. Yeah? Um... Maybe we could do that one day... When I'm ready. I, I'd like that a lot. All right. Uh, hey. Any idea when that day might be? I don't know. I'll let you know though. (Car whirs) (Engine begins knocking and ticking) (Engine chugs slowly to a halt) (Ignition fails to turn over) 
Come on. Work with me. (Hits panel) (Frustrated sigh) It's okay, it's okay. Okay... (Ignition fails to turn) (Wolf howls in the distance) (Drawer opens) (Drawer snaps shut) (Thudding within the stalls, horse nickers) (Papers rustle) (Envelope rustles) (Sigh of relief) (Truck engine revs and rumbles) (Truck rumbles away) I don't wanna talk about it, Amy. I'm glad he's gone. I don't believe you. Look! It's like your grampa said. You might want someone to change, but that doesn't make it happen. I'm sorry he left. I don't want your pity, Amy. The money I withdrew for the horses... It's gone! I guess my dad couldn't resist one last trick. (Engine rumbles) (Horse grunts) (Knocks on window) Car trouble? No. Just a rest stop. Inspired by a lack of gas and credit. It's a long story. Uh, you've got a... (Wrapper rustles) (Small, sheepish laugh) Did you need a ride home? Yeah, sure. Come on, Ed. I just need a few more days to get the money and... Yes, I know I said today, but... Fine. What did he say? He said that... If we don't have the money by the time he gets here, he's taking the horses. No, he can't do that. I'm not gonna let him. Hi. (Clears throat) 
Mark? It's Lou. I'm sorry. This is weird, right? (Awkward laugh) Something bothering you, Ty? You sounded sort of upset on the phone. You don't mind if we just sit here, do you? Things are a little crazy at Heartland right now and uh... I just need to get away. Go someplace quiet. Nobody's ever taken me up here just to sit. It's kinda refreshing. Probably a really good way to scare someone like you off. Yeah, probably. It's a good thing I don't scare too easy. Ed: Get up. Why isn't he here? He'll be here. Hey! What're you doing with my horse? I don't know what kind of glue you've been sniffing, blondy, this horse belongs to me. I'm, I'm sorry, Ashley. We couldn't buy him. Get your hands off my horse! (Laughs) 
You gotta be kidding me. You do not want to mess with me. (Engine rumbles) Ed: Ah, perfect timing, officer. There's a lunatic trying to steal my horse. Well, actually, I'm here to see you, Ed. Ed: I'm only taking back what's rightfully mine. I had a chat with one of your employees. He had some interesting things to say about the way you do business. I don't know what you're talking about, officer. I think you do, Ed. What did you tell him, you old coot? I told him you treat them horses the same way you treat me. Like crap. I thought ma and I raised you better than that. He's your father? This is what you call tough love. Take him away, officer. Ed: (Stammering nervously) 
No need to be hasty. I'd be more than happy to give the horses if she came up the money. Cheque's in the mail. You heard the lady. Cheque's in the mail. I think we're done here. Ed: Fine. (Nervous gasp) Jack: I uh... Heard about your predicament. If you need a place to stay for a few nights, you're welcome to sleep in one of the cabins. I'm willing to earn my keep, Jack. And uh... I could work at the dude ranch; I'd make a great VP of guest services. You might want to lower your expectations a little. More along the lines of... VP of outhouse scrubbing. I'll take it. Uh... You know, I'm... I'm gonna have to talk to "you know who" eventually, but... ...in due time. Okay. Thanks for talking to him. You, uh, really saved my ass today. Guess I can't resist a damsel in distress. Or a damsel with a candy wrapper stuck in her hair. (Laughs) Come on. I'll give you a lift to the cabins. Okay. Um... Can you give me a minute? Yeah. Thanks. Looking for something, Jack? (Clears throat) I'm just uh... Just getting a cold drink. Yeah, right. I know a fridge infraction when I see one. (Laughs) Well, maybe your idea about an air conditioner wasn't such a bad one after all. I'm over it. You're over it? I was watching the weather network; Supposed to cool off overnight. (Sighs) Well, I am relieved to hear that. You wouldn't have really thrown me in the pond with the leeches, right, Jack? Not even if you were on fire. (Clears throat) No. "No" what? No, I don't accept your resignation. (Sighs) 
Come on, Lou. You know this isn't working. Look, maybe you and I may be broken, Scott, but Heartland isn't. You're an exceptional veterinarian and you make this place better. Grandpa and Amy, they-they need you here... I need you here. So... Please don't quit. Do you really think I'm exceptional? (Half laughs) (Screen door opens and snaps shut) Something came for you in the mail today. It's from your dad. Whatever's in that envelope, I want you to know you got a lot of people in your corner here, Ty. Don't you forget that. Val: Sayonara. Oh, good boy! He's hungry. Are you hungry? Huh? Huh? (Laughs)
