 Previously on  Stitchers... 
 Will you marry me? 
 She said no. What's plan "B"? 
 Type your number in my phone, and I'll give you a call when it comes in. 
 Is that what I am? 
 Your friend? 
 No, you're... my best friend. 
 You wanna get something to eat? 
 Uh, remember the boy in the red baseball hat? 
 The one I saw in Captain Mulaney's memory? 
 He must be connected to both cases. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You don't like it? 
 Arrest me for breaking and entering. 
 You don't get to select our cases. 
 Then who does? 
 You? 
 Kirsten : What I really wanna do is find that son-of-a-bitch father of mine and bring him to karmic justice. 
 Get Linus's stuff back to him now! 
 Who does she think she is? 
 I think I'm NSA, bitch. 
 (music playing) 
 (giggling) 
 Stop! I thought you just came to pick me up. 
 Fine. 
 Ooh! (giggles) 
 Oh, stop. No, actually stop. 
 We have to get your stuff out of the van and back up into your apartment. 
 The moving guys are meeting us in 20 minutes. 
 Moving is stupid. 
 I don't need to move, plus Cameron's cool. 
 Oh, I will miss his sheets. 
 That thread count was ridiculous. 
 I don't think Cameron really liked us on his bed. 
 As if Lord of the Purity Rings ever used it. 
 Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. 
 All right, you know what, we really should get going. 
 Excuse me, Linus, are you keeping juicy goss from me? 
 Come on, you know how this goes. Bros before... 
 Check yourself. Spill. 
 Cameron met a girl. 
 And? 
 Her name is Nina. 
 And? 
 That is all I know. 
 Oh. 
 Except for the fact he was on the phone with her until 3:00 a.m. last night talking about  Doctor Who. 
 David Tennant this, Tardis that, all night long. 
 I love my Time Lords as much as the next guy, but I need eight hours of man sleep. 
 (door opens) 
 Sounds like an episode of  Nerd Love. 
 Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina? 
 She does now. 
 I'll check on her. 
 I'm gonna wait outside. 
 Hey, roomie. 
 I already knew about Nina, so don't worry. 
 You know, I told Cameron not to wait around while I figured out my feelings, so... 
 I can't be mad. 
 And I'm not. 
 Okay. Something's got you off-balance. What's going on? 
 My father had a first wife. 
 Elizabeth. 
 I found a cocktail napkin from their wedding in the garage. 
 Damn, you didn't know? 
 Nope, I had no idea. 
 Daddy was a player. 
 Hmm. 
 I mean, if I could find Elizabeth, she may know where my father is. 
 But she's just... She's so hard to locate. 
 You already tried hacking city records? 
 Yeah, I've tried everything. 
 Elizabeth Stinger is basically a ghost. 
 Well, true, but hunting ghosts is kind of what we do. 
 (screaming) 
 (crash) 
 (screaming) 
 Go, go! 
 (car alarm blaring) 
 Oh, no. 
 Woman : Somebody call 9-1-1. 
 Man : Stay here! 
 (theme music playing) 
 ♪ Take me inside ♪ 
♪ Take me inside ♪ Maggie : Her name is Sandy Abrams, 26. She worked as a receptionist, but was an aspiring actress. She fell to her death from the roof of her apartment building. Murder? Suicide? Was there a note? Yes. So, suicide? It wasn't that kind of note. "This is his fault. K.C." We've confirmed that it is her handwriting. Is there anyone in Sandy's life with the initials K.C.? A preliminary background check came up with no friends or relatives with that name or initials. K.C., Kirsten Clark. Or not. You're just reading into things 'cause you're focused on finding your dad. Well, how many K.C.'s are there with a dead body addressed to them? Camille has a point, which is why we're not going to stitch into Sandy. Why? It's the only way to know for sure if this note was meant for me. Okay, let's say for a moment that the note was meant for you. How do we know that it's not an ambush of some kind? We're going to stand down until I get further instructions from Blair. And how long is that gonna take? We could lose the window to stitch. As long as it takes. He's aware of the situation. But I have discovered that Mitchell Blair moves at his own pace. Look, the note says this is "his" fault. What if that means my father? We won't know if we don't stitch in. That is a leap, and I'm not going to put you in danger. We hold. That's two. Four. And you're done. Ha ha! Nice job. (both speak foreign language) Thank you. Good job. (coughs) (British accent) Camille? Liam? Oh, my god! Hi. What the hell? What are you doing here? Same as you, I imagine. Yeah. Duh, I just meant, uh... what are you doing in Los Angeles? I thought you'd be living in Europe by now. Ah, that was the plan, then a teaching gig came up. I guess I wasn't really ready to leave. Uh-huh. Does Kirsten know you're here? I'd rather she not know. I'm still sorting out some stuff. How is she? Um... (clears throat) The truth is... she has totally moved on. Totally? As in completely. She ever say anything? About you? No, bud, I mean completely completely. Wow. Well... suppose I shouldn't be surprised. That's much like her, not much affected by things. Yeah, she's... gotten a lot better about that recently. She's kind of a different person. Really? But not so different that she's interested in you. Thank you. For? For not giving me false hope. Oh, well... Would you like to get together sometime? Oh, can we get some water for this man's thirst? I'm... No, I... Anybody? You guys know. I'm talking take down techniques and hammer fists only. We do belong to the same gym now, apparently. Sparring partners? Something like that. I don't know, man. You and Kirsten, that's... "Completely completely" not happening. Besides, it's just conversation and Krav Maga. (mimics accent) "Krav Maga"? (phone beeps) That's a lot. _ So, what do you think? Um... Sure. I... I gotta go. Can I get your number? Give me your phone. Hmm, hmm, hmm. (phone beeps) (exhales) Uh, where were you? Trying to get a workout in. What? What's the emergency? Veronica Mars here wants to stitch into Sandy. Maggie gave the go-ahead? Okay, then we're going behind Maggie's back. Intriguing, tell me more. I can't stop thinking about that note. What if it was meant for me? Look, I know you're focusing on finding your father, but honestly, it sounds like a stretch, Stretch. Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger. Yeah, but what if this one does? What if...  What if we look back and it turns out to have been the key to finding him and I just... sat around and did nothing? I mean, come on, guys. I cannot do this alone. I really need... Stop. Okay, just stop. You had him at "hello." First of all, she didn't. Second, nice reference. Third... Okay, you have me now. I'm in. Makes two of us. I... hate... peer pressure... because... I always cave. All right. Looks like we're doing a midnight stitch. You know there's no way to keep this from Maggie. As soon as you bring the systems online, she'll get pinged on her phone. Well, that'll give us about 23 minutes by the time she jumps out of bed to the time she arrives at the lab and then breaks her foot off in our asses. Mm. Fortunately for us, there are four of us and she only has two feet. So, half of us will survive. What's she gonna do? Fire us? Well, not if she kills us first. Okay, let's do it. (ding) All right. Suit up, Stretch. (keyboard clicking) All right, so the moment I push this button, we got 23 minutes before Maggie shows up. Oh, you mean this button right here? (phone vibrates) Son of a bitch. Uh, yeah... that one. Well, I guess we have 23 minutes. Camille, step into Life-Sci. On it. You'll have to double up on the Engineering while monitoring Communications. I'll reroute Tim's console over to mine. I'll monitor Sub-Bio and Medical while doing me. Time to get wet! All right, guys, we've got... (click) eight minutes before Maggie arrives. Let's set the mission clock to a fully five. Since we're limited on time, I'll keep things quick. I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync. Life-Sci, Sub-Bio, Engineering, Communications, Medical, and I'll throw a com check in there for good measure. I hear you. We all do. Tick-tock, Goodkin. Okay, guys, you know the drill. Induce stitch neurosync on my mark. Three, two, one, mark! Oh, it looks like the roof was Sandy's happy place. She's reading something. A script. Cameron :  Makes sense. She was an actress. Hey! "Hey" what? Talk to me, Goose. The boy is here. Which boy? The red cap kid? Yeah. My map coding is consistent with the last time she saw him. I'm going after him. Cameron :  No, stay on point! Uh, her pulse is elevated. Kirsten, you don't have time. He's gone. I have memory jumped to a grassy area outside an office building. What is this? The only thing in nature that comes close to your beauty. Stop giving me flowers. It's over between us. Kirsten : Sandy has a creepy guy at work. He's way too into her. We're meant to be together. Just back the hell off. Okay, this is weird. Weird like "interesting" or weird like "Get your ass out of there"? It's weird like "What the hell?" (alarm blaring) Oh, oh, crap. We got a problem. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Kirsten, stay with me. Dammit. We need to pull her out! We gotta get these levels stabilized. The readings are off the freakin' charts! Kirsten, come in! Com check one, two! Kirsten, can you hear me? What is happening? What's going on? Where... where the hell is she? I can't tell. We've never mapped an area like this before. Well, figure it out! And fast. I'm not sure how much more of this she can take. Okay, I'm moving her backwards. Hold on, Kirsten. What happened? Where am I? You're safely back in Kansas, Dorothy. What the hell was that? Sandy : Get off! Kirsten : I don't know. Wait, it feels like someone's pushing me...  Sandy... us. (Sandy wails) (grunting) (clang) Sandy didn't jump. (ding) What the hell is going on? 21 minutes, not 23. I made all the lights. Remember me saying not to stitch until we knew it was safe? I know it was me saying it. Uh... yup, I recognize my voice. I'm fine. Nothing bad happened. That is not my point! You went behind my back. We're a team. At least, I thought that we were. You're right, Maggie. We're sorry. It's not their fault. It's... I had to know if the note was a clue. This is not the  Help Kirsten Clark Find Her Daddy  show. I'm sorry. We all are. Did you at least find out what the note meant? No. We couldn't access all of her memories. They were blocked by some sort of barrier. I have to run some diagnostics on it. Do it. The rest of you focus on who killed Sandy. And don't you ever pull a stunt like this again! I think that's the guy I saw in the stitch. Uh-oh. What's wrong? I know that look. We got a runner. That means he's guilty, right? Of something. Possibly just being an idiot. What should I do? Flash your badge. Excuse me, I'm Kirsten Clark of NSA. This is Detective Quincy Fisher, LAPD. (grunts) Get up. Nice. Well, I played hockey in high school. I didn't do anything wrong. Tell us about Sandy. There's nothing to tell. All right? We went out once and she blew me off. I just wanted a second chance. She didn't have to call the cops. She didn't. Then why are you here? There's no scar. What are you talking about? Did something happen to Sandy? I'm afraid we have some bad news. This it? Yeah, that's the one. (knocking) (latch clicks) Camille : Ben Spiros? Yeah? Agents Goodkin and Engleson, NSA. We're very sorry about Sandy. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. We just need to ask you some questions. That's it. Why is the government so interested in Sandy? (sniffs) Is that pot I smell? I have a prescription. Anxiety. Why are you so anxious? My girlfriend just died, man. We know. We're sorry. (breathing heavily) You okay? Yeah, man. It's my... My head is just screwed up. So, um... does Sandy have any enemies or, uh... get in any fights with anyone lately? Dude, I don't know! I just want to go take a nap. Ben, listen, if you want to help Sandy, we're gonna need you to focus, okay? Why don't you find her? "Her"? Who's "her"? Kim. She moved in a few months ago. Sandy and I started hanging out with her, meditating together. Kim was a teacher and then she lost all interest in me and she just wanted to spend time with Sandy. A lot of time. Pissed off all of Sandy's friends. Like pissed off enough that someone would want Sandy dead? Sandy was good people, man. Hey, uh, is...  Is Kim home? No. She bugged out, like, a week ago. Okay. Did she leave anything behind? Some meditation tracks for me and... and Sandy to chill to. Meditation tracks? Yeah. (dreamy music plays) Why'd Kim stop hanging out with you? (music continues) Hey. Hey, tell us about Kim, okay? What was her last name? What'd she look like? Excuse you. What? (sighs) (music continues) Ben? Oh, crap! Hey! Are you okay? Don't I look okay? Eh... Cameron, look. Call Fisher to tell him we found the killer. Fisher just left Ben Spiros at the hospital. He's in the psych ward for observation. Did he say why he pushed Sandy off the roof? He claims he doesn't remember why. He only felt an incredible anger and then blacked out. He must be lying. Eh, maybe not. They found a bottle of Tomemoral in his apartment. It's a drug used to reduce memory loss. Apparently he's been complaining lately about forgetting things. Well, I heard him listening to some kind of, like, meditation music before he went to the roof. Meditation music? Camille is tracing the company that created it. Camille : No, Camille traced it. There is no company. The track isn't available anywhere. Meaning what? Meaning the killer is in custody and the case is essentially closed. (phone beeps) Whoever K.C. is, he or she is not you. I'm not so sure. Drop it, Kirsten. We have done all that we can do tonight. We will take a fresh look in the morning. And no more midnight stitching. 
 
 Linus : Hey! Wanna do something? I... Yes, but I...  I have this huge optogenetics project due and my lab partners may stone me if I don't show up to work with them. Yeah. Okay. I'll talk to you later? You know it. Hey. Hey. Maggie in her office? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. When am I not? Don't do it. Don't give me the cop glare. Well, then spill it. (sighs) Do you ever feel like you're in too deep? Are we talking about a case? (clears throat) How do you... How do you stop the work from... hurting the people you care about? Well... I wish I knew. It's hard for people without a badge to understand, you know? Yeah. Okay. Thanks for the pep talk. Well, lucky for you, I have a badge... and an ear you can bend any time. (elevator dings) (grunting) Whoo! Good. Learn your lesson? Done. Okay. This one's apparently good for immunity, alkalization, and opening your third eye chakra. A third eye-opener. That might be the most LA thing I've ever heard. Hey, man, you're the one who chose to stay in traffic jam paradise. Why did you stay? And don't even tell me it was "for the rewards of teaching." Really? You want to hear about this? Of course I do. It probably sounds pathetic, but I miss Kirsten. I miss how easy it was to be with her. (retches) Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. You mean you miss being with a woman who made absolutely zero demands of you, you selfish English prick? Ouch. But that aside, it was my longest relationship. Granted, it was long-distance, but I could always count on Kirsten to be there when I came back to the states. I guess that's over now. And that's a good thing. What... I'm... What? Why is that a good thing? 'Cause it got me in here working out and I ran into you. You're rather easy to talk to. And real sweaty. Does that do it for you? I'm really glad we ran into each other. I gotta go. I got to go. Seriously, how do you not like  Torchwood? I like it well enough. Well enough? Okay. I just don't think Captain Jack was a deserving character for a spin-off. Oh, no, no, no, don't. Just do not. Captain Jack Harkness is hella compelling, and a dreamboat, and he is bi. (laughing) He is basically the whole package. You can't hate on the captain. Okay, well, I guess we're just gonna have to agree to disagree. I guess we are. More wine? I shouldn't. It's getting late. I should go. Yeah. I guess you should. I'll drive you. You don't have to. Good, 'cause I don't want to. Because then you wouldn't be here anymore. So... Say that Captain Jack rules and I'll stay. I'll go get my car keys. Close enough. (knocking) Rise and shine, cupcake! I hate it when people wake me before my alarm goes off. More than you hate being late for work? (gasps) Oh, it's 9:20, why didn't you wake me? Oh, this must be what it feels like to be the mother of an ungrateful child. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I must have just not set my alarm. What? There something you're not telling me? Um, no. No, no, no. Just, last night I heard a noise, and so I went to check on it, um... but there was nothing there so don't worry. (phone ringing) It was fine. Nothing to worry about. Um, hey, Linus. Hey, it's almost 9:30, where are you guys? Kirsten : I'm sorry, I'm running late. Well, get here as soon as you can. I think I've isolated the barrier you ran into in Sandy's stitch. Okay, good. Well, I should get dressed. Mm-hmm. And wash your feet. Here's the barrier I mapped in Sandy's memory. It shows reduced activity in parts of the brain's default mode network together with increased activity in the prefrontal tensional systems, Fascinating. Thank you, Mr. Spock. We agreed, I'm Kirk, you're Spock. I never agreed to that. Boys. Right, sorry. This indicates the barrier Kirsten ran into is a doorway to a distinct form of consciousness which is embedded behind Sandy's everyday consciousness. Embedded? As in deliberately placed? I think so. That is a focused and absorbed attentional state. Pull up Ben Spiros' brain scan from the hospital. Yup. See, same anomaly. Sandy Abrams and Ben Spiros both had their minds manipulated. They were brainwashed by this Kim person? But brainwashed to do what? Any luck tracking down Kim? We know she rented the apartment across the way from Ben and Sandy, paid for it in cash, and she takes care of everything through phone calls and couriers, but now that we know what the barrier in Sandy's mind is, we can drop you in behind it to see what Kim put Sandy up to. Have you told Cameron about your hobbit feet? Bah! Hobbit feet? It was nothing. I... I went outside to check on a noise and I forgot to wipe the dirt off my feet. Oh, thank God. I thought you meant hobbit feet as in hairy. Yeah, you've seen my feet. Did they suddenly sprout? Nn... Mm. (chiming) Oh. Time it goes to work, my precious. (chiming) Oh, God. Why'd you tell him? Why didn't you? We both know you have no idea what happened last night. I must have been sleepwalking. Look, once when I was a kid, I walked around the block, and I got back in bed without even knowing that it happened. It's... it's not a big deal. But it might be a big deal. The truth is you don't know. Look, if I red flag this to Cameron, he won't let me stitch, and I can't jeopardize the chance of finding out if my father's connected to it all. Please. Fine. But if your brain goes kablooey, don't come crying to me. Cameron : Induce stitch neurosync on my mark. Three, two, one! How'd I do? Where'd I drop ya? No idea. Sandy's assembling a gun. She seems to be prepping for something. Any sign of Kim? No. (exhales) Sandy was programmed to be an assassin. Her target? I didn't recognize his photo, but it was from a magazine cover cover that read "Horror Has a New Master." Linus and Cameron : Roman Bain. The movie producer? Perhaps you've all heard of a small, $200 million grossing movie called  Pig Slaughter 3? Really? No? It was a big hit. Anyway, Bain was so tough and proud of the enemies he made. I... I got it. Look. Roman Bain was sued last year for stealing the idea for a film. A film about brainwashing. Well, who sued him? A woman named Kim Charles. K.C. Right. So she claimed she was former MI6, she pitched him an idea based on her own experience with brainwashing people and turning them into assassins. He claimed it was impossible and then stole her idea. Let me guess, she lost the lawsuit? Yep, and then Sandy booked a role in the film Bain's currently shooting. Kim must have found out and wanted to use Sandy to kill Bain. Okay, I'll have Fisher find Kim Charles. She went to a lot of trouble turning Sandy into an assassin. If I was her, I'd have backup ready. She did, and he pushed Sandy off a roof. Brainwashing isn't an exact science. You know, and it's possible his programming went haywire. Well, Kim must have activated someone else. We need to warn Bain. (alarm rings) You know how many death threats I get? Some people, they don't like when the villain lives. I mean, who doesn't like it when he dies? Think your life is being threatened over a dead, fictional character? I once had a fan who tweeted that he hoped a certain body part of mine, one which I'm particularly fond of, would fall off. If I'm not getting two to three death threats a week, I'm doing something wrong. We're not talking about some Internet troll hiding behind a screen name. No, we're talking about Kim Charles. Kim Charles? What, the whack job? No, Kim Charles, the former MI6 agent who sued you for stealing her brainwashing idea. That's ridiculous. She made up the whole story. Then why'd you announce a movie about brainwashing right after? Because I came up with a better story than hers. Kim Charles is nuts. Look, if that woman could do half the things that she claims she could, well, I'd be shocked. Maybe, but still, we strongly suggest you get extra security on the lot and take some precautions. At least until the NSA does a full threat assessment. (chuckles) You see all these people? Most of them hate me. So you wanna do a full threat assessment? You're gonna be here for a long time. (dreamy music playing) Call me crazy, but this music sucks. That's because it isn't music. Here, look at this. Even tone on top is acting like a carrier for the messed up tone on the bottom. It's a coded message. That makes sense. I mean, Ben was wigging out when he played it for Camille and me. And there's gotta be an activation code. Good job, Linus. Thanks. Hey, um, off topic, but have you noticed anything different about Camille? Not that I could tell. Why? She just seems to be backing off again. Sorry, man. I just don't get it! I mean, things were going good. Ah, let's face it. (elevator dings) Women are a lot harder to read than sine waves. Hey, welcome back. What was it like meeting Roman Bain? Well, I need a shower to get the sleaze off of me. He's not taking the threat seriously. Says that Kim Charles was a phony, made up her whole story. What is that? Oh, it's meditation music. Don't you feel more peaceful? Fisher : No, not really. Kirsten? Kirsten? So what do we do? Well, Maggie's gonna talk to the head of security on the lot, see if there's a way for us to talk... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Kirsten, what are you doing? Kirsten, put the gun down. Come on, Kirsten. Kirsten, put the gun down. Hey, hey, hey. Kirsten. (keyboard clicking) (whirring, beep) (keyboard clicking) (beep) Kirsten. Kirsten! (ding) What the hell just happened? She jammed the system! I can't stop the elevator! She must have inherited Sandy's brainwashing when she stitched in. Oh, no. It's worse than that. Kirsten just got activated. A watched pot never boils. Actually it does, and it's far less excruciating than waiting for you to figure out where the hell Kim Charles is hiding! She was MI6, you were CIA. If you wanted to go dark, would someone like me be able to find you? No. So, cut me some slack. (beeping) Camille, talk to us. Kirsten's not here. Well, can you tell if she's been back at all? She hasn't. Any luck finding Kim? (beep) No. (beep) (sighs) I'm worried about her. If you tell anyone, I'll hurt you. And you taught me how. We'll find her. (sighs) She wasn't at my place. (sighs) Means she's in the wind. We have to find her before she hurts someone. Is Bain under protection? He won't let us and I can't tell him how we know without divulging the program. If we're gonna save Kirsten, we're gonna have to handle this on our own. Bain, Bain's home, Bain's... No, that's not where Kirsten's gonna strike. Okay, Sandy was programmed to attack Bain while acting in his film. If Kirsten inherited the same programing, she won't strike anywhere other than the studio. She'll wait it out till tomorrow. (rock music playing) (laughter) Oh, man. Hey, yo, check it out. Let me see that. Want a hit? (chuckles) You just got dissed, bro. Nah, she wants to party. Oh! (grunts) Bitch! (grunts) (grunting) (both breathing heavily) Come on, let's get out of here! You two spread out. If you get eyes on Kirsten, radio for backup. Bain : More. More green ooze about the edges. Okay. Mr. Bain, I need a minute. Who are you? I'm Agent Maggie Baptiste. I'm with the NSA. We spoke last night. Right. Somebody wants me dead. I am almost certain there will be an attempt on your life today. I'd like to get you to a safe location. When you're totally certain, come on back and me and you can talk. I got eyes on Kirsten. She's headed for Bain. (shell clattering) (screaming) Hey, Stretch. It's me. I'd really like it if you didn't pull that trigger. Just take it easy, Kirsten. Okay? You don't want to shoot anyone. Just stay with me, okay? Right here. Hey! Right... right here. Okay? It's just us. Look. Okay. You're being controlled by someone, Kirsten, all right? And that is something Kirsten Clark does not allow. Ever. Come on, Stretch. Remember what you told me? You told me not to wait for you. Well, that... that's exactly what I'm gonna do, all right? I'm gonna wait right here as long as it takes until you're able to break free from this, okay? I know you can hear me. And I know how strong your mind is, okay? It's one of the strongest minds that I have ever met. Remember when I died for you? Well, I'm willing to do that again, except this time, you won't be able to bring me back. Now, come on, Stretch. You still got work to do. Make the bounce. Kirsten? (breathes heavily) I'm okay. I'm okay. Gun! (gunshot) (shell clatters) (overlapping chatter) Cameron, get her out of here. Okay. Whoa, whoa, no, no! I want that woman arrested! You mean the woman that just saved your life? Hey. Drink this. I'm fine. You're not fine. Been in your shoes more than once. Trust me, it helps. That's not just tea. No. Some situations require more than just tea. Like when you shoot your first person? You didn't have a choice. You did the right thing. At least you didn't kill her. She's lucky you aren't a better shot. How did she know about the Stitchers program? She didn't. But when you showed up on her doorstep in the middle of the night, she realized that you somehow had inherited Sandy's programming, and her MI6 training wasn't about to let that go to waste. I was so convinced it was Stinger. That's too bad. What? I was hoping that letter was meant for you. It would help you get closer to finding your father. Mm. Mm! Hey. How you feeling? Okay. Why don't you tell me? Well, your brain scan came back clean. There's no trace of Kim's mind manipulation left. Good. Thank you for what you did at the studio. How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you? I didn't. But we've been in each other's minds. I know you better than you think. Hey, uh... do you wanna do something tonight? Um... I can't. Okay. That's okay. Uh... another time. Sure. Bye. Hey! You wanna hang out tonight? Mm... no, I'm tired. I think I'm just gonna crash. Oh. We can crash together. Uh, I've got a 1,000 thread count pillow with your name on it. Oh, Camille. Glad I caught you. (ding) Yeah! Um... Go. I'll talk to you tomorrow. (clears throat) So tell me. How's it going? Good. On schedule. Does he have any idea? No. Liam believes my joining his gym was a coincidence. And Linus? He, I think, suspects something. I hate lying to him. Well, the less he knows, the safer he is. You're not lying to him. You're protecting him. Yes. I know that. I just don't think he'd see it that way. Liam Granger is a soft target. I need to find out what his role is and who he's playing for. Have you been able to gain his trust? Yeah, I think he's taking the bait. Okay. Wait. Maggie, um... how far do I go with this? How far are you willing to go to protect Kirsten? (knocking) Hey. So what's up? I've got some good news and bad news about Elizabeth Stinger. I'm listening. Can I come in or you gonna take my gun from me again? (sighs) Uh, depends on the news. Come in. The good news, Elizabeth Stinger got remarried and changed her name to Elizabeth Brown. Do you have a number for her? That's the bad news. There are over 250 listings in California alone under that name. (sighs) Oh. How soon can you get them all to me?
