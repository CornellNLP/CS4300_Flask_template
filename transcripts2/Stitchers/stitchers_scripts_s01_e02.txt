 Previously on "Stitchers" 
 Maggie :  Why did your father kill himself? 
 He didn't. And he wasn't my father. 
 My name is Maggie Baptiste, and I'm working on a project that needs someone with your particular aptitude. 
 Welcome to the Stitchers program. 
 Has anyone ever done this before? 
 Her name's Marta. She couldn't handle it. 
 We work for a secret government agency that hacks into the brains of corpses and reads their memories. 
 Get out of here before I tase both of you. 
 Polygraphs don't work on me. I fail them. 
 Because of this condition of yours. 
 I know you don't get relationships, like, at all. 
 What's your problem that makes it that you don't have any friends? 
 Whose bed did I just wake up in? 
 Mine. 
 We've been asked to look into the death of a research scientist. 
 He and his partner developed the Stitchers technology. 
 His name was Ed Clark. 
 Who was his partner? 
 Your father. 
 Why weren't you and your father close? 
 You're the detective. Detect. 
 I'm in. 
 (Rock music playing) 
 (Distant siren wailing) 
 ♪ O Cadillac car ♪ 
 Where's my stuff? I thought you were kicking me out. 
 Yeah, you know, about that... I was just mad. 
 I put it all back into your room. 
 Did you put everything back where you got it? 
 Don't be ridiculous. So, tell me, did you guys stop the bomber? 
 Yeah, basically we prevented U.C. Santa Monica's library from being turned into a crater. 
 Shut up. 
 I can't believe you get the dead to tell you stuff. 
 When do you do it again? 
 Tomorrow. 
 Uh, what... what are you doing? 
 I feel bad about... 
 Just how I acted before, accusing you of screwing up my project and getting you put on academic suspension. 
 So I went ahead and cooked us a let's-be-friends dinner. 
 I'm trying to say I'm sorry. 
 So this is what "sorry" looks like? 
 Yeah. 
 Seriously? 
 Okay. 
 And this is what "pissed off" looks like. 
 I want it on the record that I'm stitching you in under protest. 
 You keep records? 
 Of course not. It's an expression. 
 Comm links. 
 We still don't know what happened to you last time you got stitched. 
 I touched something. I saw stuff. 
 What's the big deal? 
 Yeah, stitch happens. (Snickers) 
 Okay, that never gets old. Right. 
 You're not supposed to be able to touch anything. 
 You're in someone else's memory. It's an intangible. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Did I break your super-secret technology? 
 Maybe. 
 You should have seen the monitors in the lab that day. 
 They were going goofy all at the same time. 
 Goofy? 
 Goofy, zany... who cares? 
 What I need to be able to understand is how you were able to make physical contact with an intangible memory object and why it put our computers' panties in a twist. 
 Panties in a twist? Is that the actual terminology or just another expression? 
 That's actual terminology we use. We're men of science. 
 How much time do we have? 
 The sample's brain will degrade beyond viability in less than 48 hours. 
 The sample has a name... Ed Clark. 
 Right. Sorry. 
 Kirsten, I just want you to be safe. 
 You think that because of what happened to the other stitcher... 
 Marta. 
 Right, Marta. 
 You think that what happened to her could happen to me? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay. 
 Well, until you do, I'm going in. 
 Look, I didn't connect with Ed much, but he did raise me. 
 I need to find out how he died, for real. 
 I owe him that at least. 
 You sure you're ready for what you might see in there? 
 Let's find out. 
 Cameron : Stations, everyone. 
 Lights to 20%, please. 
 Mission clock is set to five minutes. 
 I'd like a go, no-go for stitch neurosync. 
 (Electric hum) 
 What the hell? 
 Ed can wait. 
 Something's come up. 
 (Theme music playing) 
 ♪ Take me inside ♪ 
♪ take me inside ♪ Lisa Keller, age 18. Died last night at a rave in Hollywood from a drug overdose. What was the drug? It's called Burundanga. It comes from Colombia. It's affectionately known as "the devil's breath"... basically the scariest drug on the planet. Linus. At low dosages the drug acts as a disinhibitor. It makes you do things that you normally wouldn't do. But at high doses, the drug causes disorientation, hallucinations, convulsions and, ultimately, death. You stopped me from stitching into Ed's memory for a drug investigation? I'm sorry, is keeping a horrific drug off the street not worthy of your time? Ed's down to less than two days before his memories degrade. This girl's memories have twice as long. Do the math. This drug is new to L.A. if it hits the street in quantity, we're looking at hundreds of kids dead or dying. You see, I did do the math. You got me to be part of this morbid confederation of yours by telling me I would get the chance to find out how Ed really died... murder or suicide. And as long as there is time remaining, you will, but after we find out where Lisa got the drugs. Fine. Well, are we gonna do this? Date of birth... 13 June, 1991. No driver's license, due to a medical condition of some kind. Mother, dead. Father, unknown whereabouts. There are big holes in her personal history. Your point, Fisher? There's something not right with Kirsten Clark. The guy that everyone assumes is her father, who she's not close to, is actually just a family friend who raised her. And can you tell me why she has the protection of some subdivision of a subdivision of the N.S.A.? Let's say... and this is a big let's-say... you're right. You know what my advice would be? Let it go. Whatever your Kirsten Clark's up to, it isn't L.A.P.D. And, for sure, it isn't you. Captain... Lisa Keller. O.D.'ed at a rave last night in Hollywood. Open the investigation. Her mother is a judge, so button this one down. The Kirsten Clark thing... let it go. This is Detective Quincy Fisher, robbery/homicide. How soon can I get the toxicology report on that Hollywood O.D. from last night? Yes, Lisa Keller. What do you mean, you can't find her body? I know it sounds like a big deal, but it's not. You can't find a body. How is that not a big deal? This is Los Angeles. We get a lot of bodies in and out of here. It happens. You never lose your car keys? You did not just make that comparison, did you? Definitely not Lisa Keller. Nope. Did you file a report? Look, Detective, you're new here, and I get that you want to do things right. Just give me a day or two to figure out where the breakdown is. I'll find your Lisa Keller. Trust me, wherever she is right now, she doesn't care. I'm gonna go interview the rave promoter. I'll be back in a few hours. Find her body. Will do. (Door opens, closes) We may have a problem. Sample is online. She's so young. Let's get this done. The sooner we do this, the sooner I get into Ed. That's all. Cameron : Stations, please. Lights to 20%, please. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. Mission clock is set. I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync. Life-sci? We are a go. Sub-bio? Go. Engineering? Go. Communications? Yeah, we're a go. Medical? Go. Comm check. One, two, one, two. Can you hear me, tough guy? Yes, I hear you. Okay, we've mapped Lisa's memories as best we can. As best we can? Is there a more accomplished team I should be working with? She was on drugs. It's unclear how that affects memory mapping. Should I be worried? I'm not sure, but you'll tell me in three, two, one. Induce stitch neurosync! (Loud dance music playing) (Distorted shouting) (Distorted) Whoa. Cameron : You okay? What do you see? (Shouting) There are a lot of people here! (Comms squeal) Let's... let's use our indoor voices, boomer. You're the only one that can hear the music. Okay, got it. Explore your environment. Look around. I can't... I can't really focus my eyes. I feel really odd. It's the memory of the drug kicking in. Okay, Lisa's memory is being overtaken by the drugs. Okay, so put me back further. No can do. I can't map earlier than a few minutes before she took it. Okay, the drugs are affecting our ability to navigate the memory. Do you want us to bounce you? No. No, no, I have to get this done. I see a guy. He looks like he's in charge. There's a girl here. I feel that Lisa knows her. Her name is Denise. Lisa is... Lisa is trying to get this girl to leave with her. What? (Distorted dialog) (Growls) (Gasps) (Computers beeping) Man : Condition unstable. Ayo : She's getting into trouble. Heart rate 133, cerebral temp 102.2. Linus, can we still bounce her? No. We passed the two-minute threshold 18 seconds ago. Okay, Sporto, I'll give you a shiny penny if you can get your vitals down. I'm... I'm bouncing. Remember... Yes, I know. First name... Kirsten. Exit pin code... iheartlinus. I am so changing that. (Gasps) Well? Lisa didn't O.D., at least not accidentally. She was murdered. I've been through the police records. None of Lisa's friends were out with her last night. Kirsten : What about Denise? I searched all of Lisa's social media. She doesn't have any friends by that name. No, it wasn't friendship that I felt. It was... Protection. Lisa was trying to save Denise from something. And that's what got her killed? B-T-dubs, after Lisa was forced to take the drugs, your heart rate and respiration were jumping around like they were booty poppin'. Yeah, the drugs, um... They turned everyone into monsters. Let me stitch into Ed. That's not going to happen until we conclude this investigation. There's nothing else to see. The drugs distorted everything, and these teen titans don't have one good idea between the two of them. Okay, that is so not true. I was thinking about ordering a pizza. Let me stitch back into Lisa then. I'll stick it out longer, see if I missed anything. You have to wait until after the absolute refractory period. What? The absolute refractory period. It's the time needed between stitches to allow the sample's neurons to reset. It has to do with the potassium transfer rate between cells. Just buy me a drink sometime, and I'll tell you all about it. It's true. He gets a few drinks in him, and that's all he ever talks about. How long is the absolute refractory period? Between five and, what, 12 hours. Each sample and stitch is different. Okay, so stitch me into Ed while we're waiting. The equipment can only be tuned to one person at a time. We don't have time to switch Lisa for Ed. Wait out the refractory period. You'll stitch Lisa again, and then afterwards we will talk about Ed. Is it okay if I go home and rest? The stitch made me pretty tired. Absolutely. You need a ride? Yeah. That's so nice of you. Linus, while we're gone, run the numbers. See if we can come up with any code to cancel out the effect of the drugs on the memory. Now I'm definitely ordering a pizza. Hey, would it be okay if we made a quick stop on the way to my house? Yeah. (Rock music playing) ♪ Loves, loves, loves, loves you little people ♪ 
♪ keep burning in the sun ♪ Wait, where are we? This is where the rave was. The r... Hey, hold up. Kirsten, wait, hold. Wait. Hey. Hey, look. You lied to me, okay? We're on the same team, and you lied to me. We have to trust each other. That's the only way we're going to be able to work together. You done? Allow me to make a few clarifying statements. We're not teammates. We're not coworkers. I'm doing this for the sole purpose of getting the chance to learn what really happened to Ed, and then I'm done with you and Maggie and your whole freak show. Well, that definitely is clarifying. Look, I'm... I'm sorry about the freak show comment. But let's be logical about this. We want to get the drugs off the streets, yes? Lisa's memories were distorted. Maybe being in the actual place where she died will help me remember more clearly the things that I saw. Okay. But we keep a low profile and, by grabthar's hammer, please try not to piss anyone off... Like you usually do. Man : I'm not interested in whatever edgy new beats you think are gonna set the scene on fire. You want to play that garbage out here? Go start a record label. Anything look familiar? Yeah, that douchebag over there. (Muttering) No. Damn, damn, damn, damnedy, damn, damn. Tickets don't go on sale till 9:00. Who killed Lisa Keller? I don't know. Drugs, according to the newspaper. And who gave her the drugs? I don't know. And you know how you know I'm telling the truth? Because I'm running a business, and dead kids... they don't pay to come to raves. Really? That's where you went with that? What about the guy with the camera, taking pictures? Maybe he saw something. That would be Raff. He's my official unofficial photographer, but I wouldn't bother him. Raff isn't nice... Like cleaver here. We're not afraid of you. (Growls) I do not why you are so mad. We know more now than we did before. Yep, we know that when I'm confronted by a bouncer named cleaver, I leak urine. Okay, how do I do this? Say I'm sorry? We shake hands? Oh, you really don't know how to apologize, do you? No, it's not really one of my skills. Oh, Maggie's gonna kill us. Okay, man up, stud. Maggie needs us more than we need Maggie. Man down, Buttercup. I mean, she can actually kill us. She's a former C.I.A. assassin. Oh, I suppose this was not to be unexpected. Miss Clark. Nerdy guy. It's Cameron. What are you two doing here? I'm afraid that's above your pay grade, Detective. Don't tell me: A secret agency mission, right? Well, if we told you, it wouldn't be a secret, would it? The name Lisa Keller mean anything to either of you? Fisher, do you play chess? No. Well, I do. Queen takes knight. I'm a "settlers of catan" man myself. So what exactly do we know now that we didn't know before? The name Raff? Yes. Okay, that's not even a real name. How are we supposed to find this guy? We have no idea who he is. But we know where he's gonna be. Take me home. Like, for reals? Or are you gonna make me take you someplace awful? For real... Then I'll make you take me someplace awful. 
 
 (Rock music playing) ♪ Back to the start ♪ 
♪ out by the sea ♪ I don't know what the big deal is. You can totally do this. I told you... I don't rave. Tonight you do. Camille : Rave? We're going to a rave? Cameron and I are going. Well, I'm so coming with, unless it's a date. Both : It's not. And you're not. It's official business. So what? It's a rave. The agency doesn't control the entire L.A. dance scene. Do they? Oh my God, come on. You guys need me there. Have either of you ever been to one of these before? That's what I thought. I'll help translate from "rave" to "noob" for you. It'd make sense to have someone there who knows what to look for. Yes! Okay, fine. But I'm not going in there without a wingman. Camille : Good. Find me someone exotic. Hey, buddy. Hey, good news: I think I've figured out the drug-filtering algorithm. I'm just running some simulations right now. That's great. I've got another mission for you. We are going to a rave tonight. (Snickers) You go to raves? (Whispering) Of course not. But tonight I do, and so do you. That's... that's awesome. I haven't been dancing in such a long time. I didn't know you dance. Dude, there's a lot about me you do not know. (Whispers) Why are we whispering? Whispering? I wasn't aware of any whispering. Good. How long before we can stitch into the sample again? Approximately five hours. Then I can expect to see everyone here in four hours and 59 minutes. Mm-hmm. (Whispers) We'd better get dancing. (Rock music playing) ♪ It's funny, but oh, it's dangerous ♪ (Door opens) Oh my God. You are more clueless than I feared. What's wrong? Nothing... If you're going to an accounting convention. How am I supposed to be dressed? Not like a real estate agent, okay? Come on. Come on. (Dance music playing) (Chattering) Yeah, thanks. You want one of these? That is all you, rainbow bright. Okay. There they are. Woof! Promise me you'll never say that again. Whoa, Kirsten cleans up good. Is that the roommate? Camille. Yeah. Kirsten, you look... Ooh, steady, Lab Rat. I was gonna say "nice." Camille, this is Linus. Woof! Seriously? Shall we dance? You lead, I'll follow, baby. (Dance music playing) Okay, okay, listen. We'll cover more ground if we split up in pairs. Buddies. So it's us. Guess so. Buddies? Or... something. I'll let you know when I spot Raff. Right. You... you ever been to a rave before? No, but I feel like I have. Yeah, you dance nice. What? I said you dance nice! Oh, I take zumba. What? Zumba! Okay. So who are we looking for, anyway? I have no clue! Okay, you look like a cop. What? You gotta blend in. Dance! I said I don't rave, never said I don't dance. What are you doing? Helping a sister out. Come on. (Laughs) Hey. Oh. Oh. Okay. Not bad. You're a fast learner. There we go. Thank you. There she is. It's Denise. (Dance music playing) You're Denise. Who are you? We're friends of Lisa Keller's. I saw her die. I know. I was there. Where is that Ass-hat Raff? I think we found him. Why are you talking to my girlfriend? In truth, I never said a word to her. Right? Well, before that one. (Distorted speech) We're gonna get you out of here. Hey, who told you where to find us? Lisa, this morning. Let me handle this. You a... "Settlers of catan" man? More or a "risk" guy, I see. Seriously? Okay, he had a knife. Do you have a death wish? Whoa. Hey, yo, we're dancing here. Oh, that's them. Remember me? Excuse me. Excuse me. I know you'll remember   me. Both : Woof! She has a taser? Damn it. Okay, let's. You two search the back half of the parking lot. Cameron and I will look for them around the front. Look for who? Not now, Fisher. Stop. I have to go. I have to save her. I said stop. Cameron : Kirsten. Camille : Kirsten, stop now. All of you, face down on the ground, now. Come on, man. This is my best kurta. Now. You play football, miss Clark? I do. Touchdown. We're investigating the death of Lisa Keller. Please stop talking. She didn't O.D. She was murdered. And how do you know this? Because we hacked into her brain after she died and read her memories. It's called "stitching." (Both groan) Is there anyone in Los Angeles you haven't told about us? All of you, up. I can prove it. You gotta be freakin' kidding me. You gotta be freakin' kidding me. What the hell is going on? Maggie, you remember Detective Fisher, don't you? Who authorized this? Well, if it makes a difference, I was going to arrest them, until Kirsten offered to bring me here. It doesn't make a difference. Well, I think we've established that you can't stop us from doing fieldwork, so I figured it would be helpful to have someone from the L.A.P.D. on the team. Figuring out stuff is not your job, and you were under strict orders only to observe Kirsten and report back to me, not divulge your involvement with the program. You're with the program? You know, I actually hadn't mentioned that to anybody yet, so that one's on you. Kirsten, wait. Fisher, come with me, please. When you woke up this morning, did you think the day was gonna turn out like this? Hm-mmm. Me neither. Hold up. Come on. Will you wait? Don't touch me. You lied to me. I did not. I didn't volunteer the truth, but I never lied. How long have you been spying on me for? Pretty much the entire last year. Look, after we became roommates, Maggie had me brought in here and made me an offer. They'd pay all my expenses and my grad school costs if I just spied on you. All your living expenses and your tuition costs? Mm-hmm. That is a pretty good offer. I know, right? And all I had to do was just keep track of you and report back if you did anything strange. And did you? I didn't know what to report. Everything you do is strange. And my academic suspension... that thing with your research? They put me up to that. Look, they needed you... Badly, and they wanted to incentivize you to join the program. And you wonder why I have such a hard time making friends. (Sighs) So... Looks like our Kirsten outplayed both of us on this one. She's, uh... Something different. You don't know the half of it. Does this actually work? Stitching? Yes. So what are you going to do with the knowledge you now have about our program? I haven't decided. Well, let me help you make the right choice. After we met yesterday, I did some research, on you. What did you find out? I found out you're like a pit bull. Once you bite down on a case, your jaw locks and you don't let go. But while this may be admirable in a cop, it's a lousy trait in a husband. Hey, stay in your lane. Your dogged pursuit at work has already cost you your marriage and will likely lead you to be transferred to another division, again. Okay, I think I'm done here. I also know you're smart, and you've been poking around the Medical Examiner's Office. I know this because the M.E. is embedded in our program. That's how we get our samples. Who are you people? We're a federal agency with a very wide jurisdiction. Including over the L.A.P.D.? Particularly the L.A.P.D. Fisher, you are the least popular honest detective in all of L.A., but become part of the Stitchers program... I can make you the most successful least popular honest detective in all of L.A. So I'm being recruited? Kirsten is right. It's obvious I can't keep them from doing field work. And, frankly, I'm not sure I should. She sees things when she's being stitched that only she can follow up on. She's going to need some kind of backup. Me? You will remain L.A.P.D., but on deep-cover loan to the Stitchers program. Keep my kids safe. And in return, I will give you the official collar when we close a case. I can't take credit for someone else's work. We're a team. We all take credit. We all share the blame. You know how to be part of a team, don't you? Refractory period is over. We can stitch into Lisa Keller again. Care to see what you've just agreed to be part of? I think you may be the devil. I'm not, but I admire his closing rate. Ayo : Her heart rate is elevating. Listen, geniuses, I'm still surrounded by monsters. Whatever you did to cancel out the effects of the drugs isn't working. Because we haven't done it yet. Linus. Running the filter... Now. Cameron : Okay, talk to me. How's it looking? Better. Much better. Ayo : Her vitals are stabilizing. Now you know what 20 minutes into the future looks like. I see them. Cameron. Isolate and reduce the volume of the background music. Give us a moment. I'm going to get you out of here. To where? Back to the shelter? For now. Then I'm gonna get you home to Montana. Raff will take care of me. He says he's got a big score coming. A big score? Stay here. She's done with you. Got that? Girl you are hot when you're pissed off. You haven't even seen me pissed off yet. I know about your big score. You keep Denise out of it. Whoa! Now I'm worried. Let go of me. You think you're special? Working with runaways, trying to save them? Well, save yourself. Raff's forcing the drugs into Lisa's mouth. Sweet dreams. Denise, let me help you. It's too late. Denise, get back in here. I'm bouncing. 11545 San Fernando road. The drugs are in Raff's camera case. Lisa Keller used to work with runaway teens. That's how she met Denise. Lisa was trying to get Denise away from Raff, so he killed her. Certainty? 100%. We're gonna need a warrant. Based on what? I'm confident you'll figure something out. Hey, Fisher. Welcome to the Stitchers program. Raff : Listen, man, this stuff is not available anywhere. Yeah, just like that show, except for this is green, not blue, and it's for real. Listen, I want to put you on my list, but you gotta commit. My man. (Crying) What are you crying about? Huh? I don't want anything to do with this. When we first met, you never told me anything about drugs. I understand. I do. I get it. So what you're telling me is that you want to be back on the streets. Is that what you're telling me, huh? 'Cause that's where I'll dump you... right where I found you. I just want to go home. Baby, you are home. (Crash) Victor Thomas, you're under arrest for the murder of Lisa Keller. Denise, my name is Kirsten. We're gonna get you out of here. Sit down. How did you know where I was? Lisa told me. Aren't you supposed to read me my rights? Eventually. (Computer beeps) His computer's password-protected. Password, please. What do you need that for? Because it's faster than hacking into your computer to figure out where you're getting your drugs from. Password. Screw you. Password, please. This is police brutality. Too bad for you we're not the police. (Taser crackles) I'm gonna go get changed. Oh, good. You're here. Did you get the call about prepping Ed for being stitched? Yes, I did, but... Hey, Cameron, how quickly can you change the computers over? Guys, wait. Listen. It's too late. No, this isn't right. What's not right? Ed's hit his best-by date. He can no longer be stitched. That's bull. No, it's true. His neural gaps have widened beyond stimulation. There's nothing to stitch. I'm sorry. Kirsten, I'm so sorry. You knew exactly what you were doing. You deliberately brought in the Keller case to keep me from stitching into Ed's memory. You give me too much credit. Did they know? Were they a part of your plan... Camille, Linus and Cameron? No, because there was no plan. I'm sorry about Ed, but this happens sometimes. You promised me. No, I said that if you can solve the Keller case fast enough, you could stitch into Ed. You didn't. And you can't. What is it that Ed knows that you don't want me to see? The reason I hardly remember my parents, or where my father is? The truth about who really killed Ed? Come with me. As we speak, Ed's apartment is being boxed up. Tomorrow all of his stuff will be delivered to the home that he left you. Every shred of paper, photograph, book, flash drive, and dust bunny is going to be yours. Perhaps the answers that you're looking for will be in those boxes. Look at her, because I need you to understand, all of you, what you did here today. Where would Denise be without the Stitchers program? Kirsten, you gave Lisa Keller back her voice, even if only for a short time, to finish what she started. You know those monsters that you saw in her memory? Well, there are monsters everywhere, and with this technology we can stop them. (Sighs) I looked, Kirsten. There aren't any monsters under your bed. Look again, Ed. There are no such thing as monsters. Well, I never did like monsters. Let's go get 'em. (Heart monitor beeping)
