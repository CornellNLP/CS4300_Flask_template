 Welcome to the Stitchers Program. 
 We work for a secret government agency that hacks into the brains of corpses and reads their memories. 
 Maggie : His name was Ed Clark. Why'd he kill himself? 
 He didn't and he wasn't my father. 
 All right Stitching affects you. 
 Makes you different for a little bit. 
 It doesn't always last. 
 You hooked up with Linus? 
 Thought we had each other's backs. 
 Cameron :  When I was 10 years old, I had heart surgery. 
 Kirsten :  My father stitching me into my mother killed her. 
 Cameron? 
 I see Barbiero. He's on a call with a woman. 
 You're using me to send a message to the girl? 
 Kirsten :  He was told things that I was meant to hear  and then he was killed. 
 Black Sedan. Can't make out the plates. 
 But maybe you did, Cameron. 
 Cameron : That memory is inside my head. 
 You're gonna go in and find it. 
 There's one problem. You're not dead. 
 I can fix that. 
 Guys... 
 You got four minutes. 
 Dead or alive, Cameron, you're coming with me! 
 (whirring) 
 I'm there! I'm outside the restaurant, but it's all blurry! It's useless! 
 Is this what love is? 
 I'm everywhere. 
 What's your name? 
 Kirsten. 
 I'm Cameron. 
 Levels are increasing! 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go! 
 (thump) 
 Cameron! 
 (thump) 
 (flatline) 
 (flatline continues) 
 Clear! 
 (thump) 
 (beeping) 
 Cameron! 
 (flatline) 
 Clear! 
 (thump) 
 (flatline) 
 Clear! 
 (thump) 
 (beeping) 
 Chelsea, time please. 
 Chelsea, time. 
 Time of death, 17:31. 
 No! What are you doing? What are you doing? 
 Shock him again! 
 Kirsten... 
 Shock him again! 
 He is not dead. 
 I can feel it. He wants to come back. 
 Please, please just shock him again. 
 Shock him. 
 Do it. 
 Clear! 
 (flatline) 
 No, no. 
 (whimpers) 
 Cameron, no. 
 No, Cameron! No! 
 No! 
 Please! 
 (sobs) Please! 
 Cameron! 
 (sobs) 
 No. 
 (sobs) 
 (gasps) 
 Cameron? Cameron? 
 I can't believe this. 
 Please... tell me you got the license plate number. 
 No. No, I didn't. 
 (sobs) 
 Well, that's too bad... 
 'cause I'm not doing this again. 
 It's okay. 
 (chuckles) 
 Cameron. 
 (theme music playing) 
 ♪ Take me inside ♪ 
♪ Take me inside ♪ (blipping) (door opens) How's he doing? He's fine. Good. 'Cause as soon as he wakes up, I'm gonna kill him. The real question's how are you doing? You know me. I thought I did. That's why I'm asking. I think I was just a little overwhelmed. Well, that's understandable... except we're talking about you here. Cameron : Keep it down. Trying to rest in peace. Hey. How are you doing, tough guy? Oh, 100%. (chuckles) How's Fisher? He's out of danger. He's gonna be fine. Cameron? Do you remember anything from the stitch? I had a dream that you were, um... an angel and I was a... hero. (chuckles) What'd you see when you were in my head? Linus, may I see you in the hallway? I want to hear. Ouch! O... okay, okay. (door closes) What'd you see? Is this what love is? Intense connection and then heartbreaking loss? Thank you... for not being a nobody. I saw... It can wait. Camille : That was probably the most awful experience of my life. I know. I mean, did you see her when Cameron revived? I've never seen her like that. Have you? Never! She's always only ever been, you know... How do I even say it without sounding mean? Ugh... emotionally reserved? Um, emotionally inaccessible. Bitchy. But now she's completely different. She cried. I mean, you saw it. Like, big, soppy tears. That wasn't residual emotion. That was real emotion! God, I hope it lasts. (sighs) Well, she's not the only one who's changed. Why? What do you mean by that? I've been a jerk. Oh... No, no, no, no. Listen, I... I have. Yeah, no, I was gonna agree with you. I don't know what's gotten into me the past couple of days. Cameron was right about you. You did a great job during the stitch. Much better than I would've. (exhales) Thank you, Linus. Everyday I deal with life and death and shattered lives and heartbroken people, and then I go back to the same bedroom in my parents' house that I grew up in. I mean, how does that even make sense? Yeah. (chuckles) It's time I grew up. Well, you know, you could be feeling this way because of what happened to Cameron. Sleep on it. Who knows? You could feel differently tomorrow. I hope not. Maggie : How could you let Cameron do that to himself? I only agreed with him. It wasn't like I stuck the damn needle in his arm. Look, Maggie... yesterday was a hard day on all of us. Why don't you go home? Take the day off. Tomorrow, we'll dig back in, figure out where this threat to our program is coming from. From where I stand, you are the biggest threat to the team. Easy now. Remember, I am the director of the program that employs you. A few months ago, I asked you what I should tell Kirsten when she asks me what the real purpose of the Stitchers Program is. Do you remember what you told me? I said you should tell her whatever you want as long as it's not the truth. Why can't she know? Why can't they all know? That we are developing a technology to accelerate the evolution of the human brain? What are you keeping from me, Les? I know it's something. What is it? You took Fisher off the Ed Clark investigation. Why? Was he getting close to something? Listen, I think we're done here. You killed Ed Clark, didn't you? Just because you hang out with kids all day doesn't mean we're playing a game. I'm asking you again! Did you kill Ed Clark? Saving the world is a messy business. People get hurt. Some get killed. How many people are you willing to kill to save six billion? I don't know. But I assure you, if pushed, I would kill one to save 19. Well, that's the number of people in your lab. Who's the one you'd kill to save them? (door rattling) Cameron? Morning, sunshine! Um, what... Uh, how are you feeling? I feel great! Yeah, doctor said I'm good to go. Apparently death agrees with me. You okay? Yeah. No, she's not. Go ahead. Tell him. Tell him what? She's been feeling a little emotionally raw since the last stitch. Cameron : Emotions? As in those things you don't normally feel? Mm-hmm. If it's okay, I would like to talk to Cameron. And Fisher wants to talk to you. He's awake. Cameron : Well, some people will do anything to avoid having to be with a friend. I didn't know we were friends. Oh, shut up. We all know you're crazy about me. (chuckling) Hey, but seriously, man, thanks for pushing me out of the way at the restaurant. Kirsten. At the restaurant, what I wanted to tell you, Les Turner ordered me to stop looking into Ed Clark's murder. Why did he do that? I think because I was getting too close to the truth. I think Turner killed Ed. Son of a bitch. Stay with Fisher. What? Kirsten! Turner! (alarm blaring) Kirsten : Okay. Yeah, I know the way into my own lab. Stand down, Admiral. I'll take it from here. You okay, Stretch? Still freaked out about Turner getting killed. I mean, everyone is. Look at this place. It's like Union Station during rush hour. I like to pack heat... Oh, God, there's more of them? First Fisher and now Turner. Looks like the NSA isn't taking any chances with the rest of us. Just because you're the guy in the black jumpsuit doesn't mean I have to explain mind map anomalies to you. That's exactly why you should explain them to me. Ahem, everything okay? The head of the Stitchers Program just got murdered. There's something very wonky about his mind map that I cannot figure out and I've got a high school dropout here who wants me to explain it to him. A heavily armed high school dropout. You must be Clark... the one who strips and gets in the water. I see that you have met Captain Stamperson. NSA has assigned a captain and his men as our new security detail. He's asking a lot of questions. Which I have the authority, security clearance, and imperative to know. And which you will, but this facility is under my authority until a new director is appointed and I am told otherwise. How are you taking it, Maggie? Well, Les and I had our differences, but this... There was no sign of forced entry at Turner's apartment, so it's likely he knew his killer. You okay to do this? Sure. Why are you asking? We're worried you may be more emotionally vulnerable in the stitch right now. Because of what happened to Turner? Linus : That... and because you had a complete meltdown yesterday. That's why we want you to try something. I had just gotten used to the Catwoman suit. I know, but there was some more push back. This is the Rev 2. We've been prototyping it since Marta's accident. It's made from the same zinc-blackened nickel over copper, but reinforced with padding and Kevlar panels. Kevlar? Let's be honest, you used to come out of the stitch and sort of feel emotions, and ever since yesterday's stitch, you've been starting to really feel them. Okay. Well, how is this suit gonna protect me? It's simple psychology. How do you feel? I mean, slightly badass. Then it's working. The knowledge that you're wearing a slightly badass suit will make you feel stronger, so then you'll be stronger. Okay, Captain, why don't you come with me? Hey, um... what'd you want to tell me at the hospital? (alarm chimes) It can wait. I was briefed, but... I didn't believe it. So... she can see his memories? Maggie : It's called stitching. Does she have to eat his brain? What? No! Ugh. She's not a zombie. This is science. Thank God. All right, everyone listen up. Whatever we felt about Turner, he got us where we are today. So, let's bring our "A" game. Lights to 20%. I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync. Life-Sci? Go. Sub-Bio? Go. Engineering? Go. Communications? Go. Medical? Go. Comtek. Kirsten, one, two, one, two. I hear you. Mission clock set to five minutes, please. (sighs) Here we go. "Open the pod bay doors please, HAL." That's from  2001. He watched a lot of movies when he was a kid. Induce stitch neurosync on my mark. In three, two, one... mark. (whirring) Um, I'm in Turner's apartment. (indistinct chatter) There's something seriously wrong here. Describe it. Turner's memory is a mess. It's like it... (crashing) exploded from the center of his consciousness. It's making me really dizzy. Linus? His mind map is completely fragmented. Can you defrag it? I don't know. Kirsten, how are you holding up? You wanna bounce? No, not yet. There's still bits and pieces that are visible. (gasps) Oh, wait. I smell something. Incense. She's experiencing sense memory. Huh, that's new. No, I really don't feel well. I'm bouncing. (whirring) Trash can. Quick. (vomits, coughs) She do that every time? No. That's also new. Linus : When a body comes in, the first thing we do is map his or her memories. Specific memories have a pattern. Uh, a puppy, your first kiss. Or in your case, the first time you broke someone's arm. Keep pushing me, Goodkin. "Dr." Goodkin. Cameron. Anyway... for the last 15 years, the Stitchers Program has cataloged over 18 million unique human experiences. The computer compares the digital signature of these experiences against the subject's mind map as well as determining the age of the memory. That's how we know where to move Kirsten. What do you know? The high school dropout understood everything you said. (sighs) Here's what a normal mind map looks like... and this is what Turner's looks like. Cameron : Turner's brain unfragmented his memories along all three axes. That's why I got nauseous. I was completely disoriented. Could Turner have trained his mind to make himself unstitchable? With Turner, it's possible. Any chance you can resort his memories? I'm already working on it. I wanna go to Turner's condo. I saw something in the stitch that I want to check out. Okay. Camille's with Fisher, so you and Cameron go. Okay. Okay. Hold it. Lee, Kirkwood, go with them. Um, we don't need babysitting. My job is to keep you safe whether I feel like it or not. Oh. That hurts my feelings. Okay, boys, let's go. Try to keep up. On it. (whistles) Wow. So what are we looking for? Uh... (door closes) (radio chatter) That. Ah. Yup. It's a Ginsburg. Still don't see the attraction. (beeping) (buzzes) Okay. What's the code? In the stitch, I saw the number one... six, three. (beeping) (buzzes) Okay, what else? A grasshopper. I saw a grasshopper. (beeping) (buzzes) Officer : I'm gonna go look around here. What's Turner's ancestry? I think I heard Maggie say something once, like, he was French Moroccan? Sauterelle. (beeping) It's French for "grasshopper." (French accent) But of course. (chiming) Turner has a panic room. Cameron : Whoa. Sacrebleu. The hard drive's missing. Look. _ It's a federal inventory control sticker. (shutter clicks) But it's hospital policy. I don't care. I don't want a sponge bath. Don't be a baby, Fisher. Take your bath like a good boy. (phone chimes) Where are you going? Sorry, Fishcakes, I gotta get to work. But... Keep her busy. Take the frickin' bath. Bye, honey. He's all yours. Fine. But my safe word is "not there." (beep) (beep) Mm, habanero potato chip? No thank you. You don't do spicy? I don't do dead people's food. Mm. Also, you know, Turner's body was just here. Right. Sorry you had to see that. As if that video of your dad stitching you into your mom wasn't bad enough. You know, whatever crashed in my head when he did that... it cut me off from my emotions, right? I think that stitching into you rebooted me. I guess it's possible. I mean, stitching into a live person broke you, so stitching into another live person fixed you. Right, but you were dead. I was only mostly dead. I was really scared, you know. Seeing you like that. I have never been scared like that before. Hey, but scared is sometimes good... unless it becomes the new normal. In which case, that's no way to live. (phone rings) Camille. Talk to us. Okay. So thanks to an exploit I found in the GSA inventory control database, which, B-T-dubs, was the size of Taylor Swift's ex-list, I learned that Turner's computer was listed as destroyed 15 years ago. But it wasn't. Exactly. So, I went deep and I found the company that supplied the inventory control stickers to the government, found the shipping address where that particular sticker was sent, and I'm texting it to you now. (phone chirps) Got it. Thanks. Hey, say hi to Fish, okay? Hold it. Captain Stamperson wants us to bring you back to the lab. Well, this is going to be an excellent lesson for Stamperson on not getting everything he wants. He said by any means possible. Fine. Then you can give us a hand. With what? The computer. Obviously the computer. Yup. It's what we came here for. Let's bag it, tag it, and get it back to the lab. I'll, uh, look for a garbage can, laundry basket, bread basket, something to carry it in. (beeping, chiming) Hey! No! Wow, check out the testicles on Cameron 2.0. Thank you. 
 
 Lee : Hey! Open the door! Uh-huh. Hey! Yeah, there's no easy access here either. This whole building's locked tight. This place is deserted, but not derelict. Someone's been taking care of it. Wait here. Excuse me? Cameron, what are you doing? I'm seeing if there's a way in through the roof. If there is... I'll come down and open the doors from the inside. Cameron! Don't get so scared all the time! Who are you? Are you out of your mind? What if you fell? But I didn't, so calm down. "Calm down"? "Calm down"? I'm beginning to miss the old Kirsten. What's that supposed to mean? I barely survived having one mother. I don't need another one. I think I'm beginning to miss the old Cameron. Whoa. What is that? Something big was bolted down here. (low buzzing) (shudders) Do you feel that? What? Come in. (low buzzing) Whoa. Yeah, now I do. It's only inside this circle. You feel that? Yeah. It's, um... It's static electricity. Where's it coming from? There must be something about this place that was in Turner's hard drive. What went on in here? Hey! Don't move! Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's okay, guys! We're NSA! Let me see your badges. Badges? Cameron, your heart can't take being tased. We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I ain't gotta show you any stinkin' badges. (grunts) (clicking) Kirsten! (grunts) (clicking) (sighs) Okay, so maybe a movie quote wasn't the best idea at the time. Hm... How's your hand? Oh, it's fine. But you shouldn't have jumped in front of that taser like that. You could have gotten hurt. Said the man who recently stopped his own heart. (chuckles) I guess we're even. What is going on with you? Climbing buildings, locking security guards in a panic room, slugging people? I can't help it. I can't. I just...  I feel free. I died. I died and then I came back. I... I get a second chance to live my life. I'm not gonna live in fear anymore. Hey, it's still me. Cameron... 2.0. Remember? What's your name? Kirsten. I'm Cameron. Your mom's gonna be okay, Kirsten. Trust me. We met when we were kids. What? We met in the hospital. I was there. It was right after my mom's accident, and... you were there for your heart surgery. I have that memory? Wow. I mean, I don't remember much before my dad stitched me. Are you sure you don't remember? I mean, I was in and out of that hospital for weeks at a time. And there... there was so many kids my age. Did we... did we talk? Yeah. You told me my mom was gonna be okay. Sorry I was wrong. No, it's okay. You were very sweet to a scared little girl. (footsteps) I am very tempted to have the two of you spend the night here making new friends in your holding cells. Blatant disregard for protocol, breaking and entering, assaulting a security guard, getting arrested? In our defense, things wouldn't have escalated the way they did if we had badges. Oh, you mean badges like these? Are those real? I asked Turner for weeks to let me issue them to you. Now that he's gone, there's no reason not to. I figure since the need to both have you in the field and the lab is clear, these will come in handy. Uh, one more thing. Just because the badge is in the shape of a shield does not mean it is one. Protect yourself. Don't do anything stupid. Sweet. So, do we get, like, guns too or... Don't push it. Sergeant, Agents Clark... and Goodkin are ready to leave now. Oh, hey, Bonnie and Clyde! How's life on the outside? Funny. Refractory period is up. Where you at on re-sorting Turner's memories? Stamperson : Goodkin! My men were in that damn panic room for an hour. You had no authority to ditch your security detail. Ha! Actually, um... (blows) this says I do. And it also gives me the authority to tell you to get the hell out of my face. Where did you get this? Maggie. Any luck defragging Turner's memory? Yes. I've re-indexed his memories using homogeneous coordinates. Then by implementing a scaling matrix, I'm able to rotate any object in the stitch three-dimensionally. It should make Turner's memories a more cohesive whole now. "Should"? Only one way to find out. You know, I'm not sure that I'm used to this new Cameron yet. Yeah. Me neither. Hey, but seriously... did you get a badge too? (giggles) How do I get one? You know, I think you have to get arrested first. I could so do that! Talk to me, Agent Carter. How is it? (distorted chatter) Still wonky. Starting scaling matrix now. (click) How's it look now? Same memories as before. (rattling) But better. Cameron, is there a memory hot spot 15 years back? I'm looking... I don't care what happened to him 15 years ago. I want to know who killed him yesterday. The computer in Turner's panic room was supposedly destroyed 15 years ago. Just gonna guess that has something to do with his murder. Who's running this operation? The smart people. Go for it. Got it. Hold on, Kirsten. (whirring) (alarm blares) Do something! (overlapping chatter) Woman : Abort! Kirsten, what do you see? (grunts) A pod of some kind. Now I'm getting voices. Linus? I'm working on it. Man : Get her out of there! Man 2 : I can't! Man 3 : Project Grasshopper! Shut it down! Okay, Project Grasshopper was an experiment of some kind. It failed... (quick blipping) Heart rate's 180. Cameron, get her out of there. Hold on, Kirsten. I'm moving you back towards Turner's murder. (whirring) (Maggie and Turner's conversation overlapping) It's still not clear. I'm getting overlapping images and sounds. You're the biggest threat to the program. Damn right I moved the asset! It's protocol! I'd kill one to save 19. Am I the one you'd kill? I smell incense again. I'm rotating the memory fragment further. She's gonna lose her lunch again. No, she's not. Okay, get the trash can. Okay, maybe she is. Just give it a sec to line up. Just breathe, Kirsten. You're doing great. (breathes slowly) No! Don't! (gunshot) Kirsten, you okay? Does she see who killed Turner? Did you see who killed Turner? Yes. Maggie. Comtek. Now., Come on! Here. Kirsten, what the hell are you talking about? I saw you shoot Turner. Then you saw wrong. I saw you. You killed him! Kirsten, you saw me in his memory because I was there that day, but I didn't kill Turner. Ms. Baptiste, I think we have some things to talk about. Look, the stitch is still active. We have three minutes left. (clicking) Kirsten, whatever you saw, it was wrong. Stand down! That's an order! Ms. Baptiste, please cooperate. No one wants things to escalate. Maggie! Let him go, Baptiste! What's going on? I believe this is called a Mexican standoff. Something's wrong with the stitch. I did not kill Turner. Linus, is there? I... I don't know! There cold be! I am losing my Patience! Drop it! Linus, figure it out! You got two minutes! She's right. There's still time. Kirsten? Let's do this. Linus? Look, it is hard to focus with all these guns out! (whirring) Okay, try it. Okay, what do you see now, Hot Shot? (whirring) (crackling) Same thing. Maggie just shot him. That never happened. Wait. Cameron, replay that. Rolling back... Wait. The pieces are still moving. They're out of sync. What does that mean? It means she can't be sure Maggie was the shooter. 40 seconds. Camille, take over for Cameron. Excuse me? What? Just do it! Cameron, head to engineering! Come on! Move! (grunts) (humphs) You break it, you buy it. Shut up, Tim. What's going on? Turner's memory's exploded into three dimensions. We need three separate controllers to realign the fragments. I'm rerouting Turner's mind map to all the terminals now. We need to rotate the pieces together. Okay? Just watch the map. It's like doing a 3-D Jigsaw puzzle. Ready? Go! (whirring) (crackling) Incense. (beeping) Six seconds. Cameron :  Kirsten, make the bounce! Well? I couldn't tell who it was, but I am sure it was not Maggie. (sighs) (sighs) (sighs) Stand down. How's it feel to save the day? (sighs) Doesn't suck. Well, that was fun. If you're done screwing around, can one of you geniuses please go figure out who killed Les Turner? Hey. Things got kind of cray. How you doin'? Like someone out of clues. Look, I know we're at a dead end right now, but we will figure this out. We always do. Everything that's happened... Fisher getting shot, Turner killed, almost losing Cameron... I feel like... What? You started a sentence with "I feel." (chuckles) I'm just still not used to that. Yeah, me neither. This whole... emotions thing, how do you deal with it? Usually poorly. But I have found that homemade baked ziti with a glass or three of red wine helps put things in perspective. (sighs) Come on. We'll go home, bust open a bottle of Pinot, and figure out this whole emotions thing. Did I mention that I cook, you clean? That's unfair. I have seen the mess you make in a kitchen. Psh. Price you have to pay for that ziti, though. (beeping) (sighs) (alarm rings) Kirsten? This readout. I saw it in Turner's memory. It stopped at 163. Um, that's here. Something on this level. Just... just hold it. (ding) Oh. Jeez, it's freezing. What's Turner keeping in here? (lights buzzing) It's not a what. It's a who. What the hell is this place? I was hoping one of you could tell me. That's... Ed Clark. Turner's had him here right under our noses since his murder. Why? Maggie : I didn't know anything about this chamber. This is your lab! How could you not know? 'Cause I didn't. Son of a bitch built it. You knew about this? No. I mean, not exactly. Turner once asked if I could build a drug protocol to extend the shelf life of our subjects. Something about breaking the four-day limit on viability. So, you helped him build this? And you didn't tell me? It was a theoretical conversation. I drew up some preliminary plans. I didn't know he was gonna use them. Well, he did, and Ed was a Guinea pig for your experiment. You told me that Ed was cremated. That his ashes were sent to a distant sister somewhere. That's what I was told, too. Turner kept this secret from all of us. So what do we do? What I've wanted to do since the very beginning. We stitch into Ed. We have no way of knowing if his memories are even viable. Everything that's happened to us began with Ed's murder. It started with Ed. Maybe he has answers. And nobody is going to stop me from looking for them. Listen, Kirsten, with the new protocol, Ed's memories are impossible to map. So, we're gonna use the mind map that we generated the first time we stitched into Ed. Is it safe? I'm not sure. But the moment it goes sideways, I'm gonna bounce you. No, you're not. This stitch is mine. Fine. I've moved you to Ed's last available memory. How's it look? Not good. Your drug protocol sucks. Wait... something's resolving. They're... they're fighting over something. I'm not sure what. Who's fighting? Who's fighting? It's... it's just not clear. Alex, on my signal, boost glutamate and atropine level to 100%. You sure? Yes. Just do it. Linus? Linus, increase conductivity to every sensory target zone. If you do this, Ed's memory's gonna flame out. Look, there's barely anything left. Kirsten, brace yourself. We're firing every synapse Ed's got left. Can Kirsten's mind take it? Okay, Kirsten, the Rev 2 suit is meant to protect you. It's made of tough stuff, just like the person wearing it. Go, Alex. (whirring) 100%. Linus, go. I hope you know what you're doin'. Ed : You've done enough to her! I won't let you! She's suffered so much already! (gunshot) (groans) I smell incense again. Done! (breathes heavily) I didn't see the killer. But I did smell incense again just like in Turner's memory. Whoever killed Ed also killed Turner. I'm gonna increase security. You're not going anywhere without an armed detail. No. You don't get to tell me... Yes, I do. Look, we're not in any danger. Ed was trying to protect me, there was a fight over Ed's gun, and it went off. That was three months ago. Okay, well, what about the attack on Fisher? It was Barbiero. I mean, whoever he was working for tried to call it off, but Barbiero wouldn't listen. And Turner? In the stitch, I heard something about Turner moving some asset that the killer wanted. The voice on the phone, she said that they would come for me when they think I'm ready. Ready for what? To hear the truth. So what do we do until then? Our jobs. (beeping) (alarm rings) (creaking) I swear to you, I didn't know about Ed. I died for you. What... why would I lie now? Everybody has their secrets. Maggie, Turner, Camille... Why not you? Tell me one thing I kept from you. Cameron. No. You were inside my head. What secrets did you see? I didn't see anything. I guess you're right. Everyone's got their secrets. (alarm rings) (elevator resumes) Hey, Dad. You missed a spot. I did? What's that smell? That is sandalwood. Do you like it?
