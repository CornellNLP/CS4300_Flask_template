 Previously on  Stitchers... 
 What's your name? 
 Kirsten. 
 I'm Cameron. 
 Cameron met a girl. 
 Linus : Her name is Nina. 
 Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina? 
 She does now. 
 Kirsten : I don't want things to be awkward between us and I want to protect our friendship. 
 The boy is here. 
 The red cap kid? 
 Yeah! 
 Liam Granger is a soft target. 
 I need to find out what his role is and who he's playing for. 
 Camille? 
 Liam! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Liam believes my joining his gym was a coincidence. 
 And Linus? 
 Wanna do somethin'? 
 I have this huge optogenetics project due. 
 I hate lying to him. 
 Well, the less he knows, the safer he is. 
 Kirsten :  What I really want to do is find that son-of-a-bitch father of mine and bring him to karmic justice. 
 My father had a first wife. Elizabeth. 
 Elizabeth Stinger got remarried and changed her name to Elizabeth Brown. 
 There are over 250 listings in California alone under that name. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 It's not too late to change your mind. 
 Never been more sure of anything in my life. 
 Ooh... 
 You are correct. 
 Mm! 
 "Don't cross the streams" is, in fact,  Ghostbusters. 
 "We should never come here again" 
 "because it would never be as much fun." 
 Lost in Translation. 
 That's too easy. 
 (chuckles) 
 (phone beeping) 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Is that work? 
 No, it's... (chuckles) my alarm...  to get up for work. 
 Did we really just stay up all night talking movies? 
 No, we started with video games. 
 Oh, yes, yes. 
 And then we, uh, leisurely made our way to best comic book superhero team. 
 Avengers. (coughs) 
 We are not having this discussion. 
 Uh, Justice League. And then... 
 Ugh! 
 And then we went out for a delicious, uh... 
 Ugh. 
 Pre-dawn snacks. 
 Pastrami hotdog I'm going to regret in about three hours. 
 And then we ended up pulling our first all-nighter. 
 All-nighter. 
 That was the most fun I've had in a really long time. 
 Me too. 
 Do you wanna come over to my place tonight after work? 
 You know, just because you come over doesn't mean I want you staying indefinitely. 
 I just gotta get ready for work. 
 I'm being that guy right now, aren't I? 
 Little bit. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, I don't mean to give you mixed signals. 
 Just it's late, it's... it's early. 
 Come on. 
 Relax, okay? 
 I'm just saying it would be nice. 
 (chuckles) 
 Coco! 
 Coco! 
 (theme music playing) 
 ♪ Take me inside ♪ 
♪ Take me inside ♪ Hi, is this Elizabeth Brown? I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a man named Daniel Stinger. Do you know him? Are... are you sure? My name's Kirsten. I'm looking for a man named Daniel Stinger. Stinger? Uh, well... well, it's "S" as in... Sam... Hi, is this Elizabeth Brown? "R". No, no. No, no, no, it's... it... "R." O... okay. Can... can you tell me if... if, uh, either of them were, uh, previously married? Uh, to a man. Thank you so much for your help. (knocking) Don't you think it's time you came up for some air? Or food? No. No, I'm fine. I just have to figure this out, you know, and Elizabeth Brown is the key, so... Honey, Elizabeth Brown is one of many keys, including but not limited to good hygiene, proper nutrition, and not obsessing, all of which you could afford to pay more attention to. Particularly, that last one. Okay. Take a shower. Let's go to work. Okay. But you know what? There is actually nothing wrong with my hygiene. Look. I'm fine. Mm, I don't know. Okay, time is of the essence on this one, so let's dive right in. Linus : That's Coco Soo. Coco who? Uh, Coco Soo. She's the biggest pop star in China. Ever. How do you know about her? Forgive me for knowing about international pop culture. I'm not interrupting you all, am I? Coco was in Los Angeles for the opening leg of her first U.S. tour. Ten cities in three weeks. Her fans are gonna be devastated when they find out. What? Last night, Coco was found in her dressing room by her body guard, Mei Ling... Who was passed out and possibly drunk during the murder. Authorities are en route to retrieve Coco's body for her husband and bring Mei Ling back to face charges. That's her husband? Linus : Liang Soo. Zillionare industrialist. He bankrolled Coco's career. Liang Soo is well connected in high places in China. We have a small window to find Coco's killer and keep this from becoming a festering, international incident. Should we be concerned you know so much about a Chinese pop star? (phone chirps) Nina? Hm? Oh. Uh, yeah. You know, you... you can talk about her around me. It doesn't have to be super awkward. I know. It's just... weird talking to you about another girl. Cameron, we're friends. It's fine. I'm totally cool with it. Really? Mm-hmm. Good. I mean... I... I think you'd like her. You guys should... meet. Yeah! I would love to. Right now, I... I'm just, um... kind of using all of my spare time to, like, dig up a lead on Elizabeth Brown. Yeah, no, and I understand you're trying to find your father and get some closure, but I think you obsessing over this is what's causing the boy in the red cap anomalies in your stitches. The boy in the red cap is there. I'm not imagining things. Wait, have you... Have you talked to Maggie about this? No, and I'd rather not, but if the worry starts to get real... I'm gonna have to. You know...  I'd actually... I... I would actually love to meet Nina. What are you guys doing tonight? Dinner? I'll cook. Oh. We could just order in. No, no, no, no. I'll cook. It'll be fun. 7:00? Yeah. Great. Yeah. All right. Well, um, I mean, I've told her, like, everything about you. Really? You're... Yeah. You're gonna...  You're gonna love her. Hey. Is everything okay? I couldn't help but notice you've been a little distracted lately. Oh. Well, I mean... I mean, after all that drama with Theo, yeah. I... I have just kind of wanted a little bit of me time to recharge, you know? Me time. I... I totally get it. I'm totally down with me time as long as it's not code for "There's something I have to tell you." It's not. Good. Well, maybe we can squeeze in some us time soon? Sure. Great. Maybe I should take you off your assignment. It's taking an emotional toll. I can handle it. I didn't mean an emotional toll on you. I've put in way too much time grooming Liam to stop now. All right. Mission clock to five minutes. Induce stitch neurosync on my mark. In three, two, one, mark! (pop music playing) (cheering) (speaking Chinese) (giggling) (shutters clicking) You looked great out there. You looked even better yesterday with your boyfriend. I know you don't speak English, but this you'll understand. (shutter clicking) You want that? Hey, give me 200,000. Dollars, not yuan. Coco's being blackmailed by a paparazzo creep. He's, uh, got a picture of her with some guy and not her husband. Any way to I.D. the man in the picture? No. Nothing. (both speaking Chinese) (conversation repeats) You all right? No. Where were you? Why was he able to get to me? Guys, I... I just understood Chinese. Seriously? Cameron : It makes total sense. Kirsten's in Coco's mind. She hears Chinese, she synthesizes the meaning. Wow. Take me to Coco's dressing room. Stand by. (click) Yeah, but this happened because you went out without my protection! I don't need you every second of my life. That is my job! And it's my choice if you get to keep your job, so back off. Kirsten : Sounds like Coco gave her bodyguard the slip. Probably to meet the man in the picture. I'll be next door if you need me. Okay, I've got Coco's death memory mapped. Okay. Kirsten, we can move you to the time of death. Let us know when you're ready. Let's do it. (knocks on door) Mei Ling? I'm sorry I went out without you. I promise I'll explain soon. Mei Ling? Coco's trying to apologize, but Mei Ling's giving her the cold shoulder. Mei Ling? What... (muffled scream) Heart rate is elevating. Talk to me, K. Your ticker's on warp speed. Coco's being attacked by someone. I... I can't see a face. She's close to the death moment. (screams) (clattering, shattering) Blood pressure dropping. Kirsten, make the bounce! Man : Where? Where is he? Coco was attacked by a Chinese man. Her bodyguard, Mei Ling, was unconscious. Before Coco died, the man tried to get her to give up the location of some guy. You mean the older dude from the paparazzo's photo? (sighs) Unfortunately, the true answer died with Coco. So the man on the paparazzo's camera was not Coco's husband. The paparazzo said he was her boyfriend. Coco didn't deny it. Then he had no reason to kill her. She was his golden goose. Wait, can we just talk for a sec about how Kirsten was able to understand Chinese? I really think we should test for neuroplasticity. No. Okay, just continue. Maybe the husband got jealous and sent an assassin to kill Coco and her boyfriend? Cameron : Well, it makes total sense. We're a guilt culture, China's a shame culture. Honor is huge over there. They would do anything to save face or the shame will follow them forever. Hey, maybe the bodyguard knows something. Where's Mei Ling now? LAPD is holding her until their superiors arrive to claim Coco's body, then it's back to China. Okay, I'll have Fisher bring her in for questioning. Alex can translate. Maybe she knows who Coco was seeing on the side. Okay, don't be scared. You're not under arrest. You understand? (mumbles) En... English? Do you speak any English? I'm taking you some place where you can answer some questions about Coco. Who she was seeing, why she snuck away from you, and you have no idea what I'm saying. Food? H... hungry? You're hungry! Oh, great! Now that's progress. I know a Chinese restaurant where we're going... Oh! Hey! That did not just happen. Whew. Whew. (chuckles) I have to tell you, I'm very impressed. Ah, it's no big deal. I've been kicking ass for years. I mean, with your skill level considering you haven't been training that long. Oh, well, thank you. You're quite good yourself. Where'd you first learn? Uh, from an American friend. Brilliant mentor. He was a big believer that a person should be able to defend his family. I worked with him all through grad school. Who is he? This friend of yours, you still in touch with him? Not really. Why? Just sounds like he took a real interest in you. Yeah, unlike someone I know. Are you joking? Does it not look like I'm interested? Yeah, but only in training. You do remember I'm roomies with the girl you wanted to marry? Thought I wanted to marry. I never had any problem putting Kirsten out of my mind during my travels. But I can't stop thinking about you. Dinner tonight? (chuckles) You're trouble. (elevator dings) I... Hey. Fisher, where's the bodyguard? I don't want to talk about it. She didn't... I said I don't want to talk about it! Is Kirsten still checking out backstage photos? The Chinese will be here in less than 20 hours, and you let our best lead handcuff you to a bike rack and escape? Thank you, Maggie, for that additional emasculation. But I will get her back. Trust me. Wait, wait... I said I don't want to talk about it! Hey, Fisher. Nice job with the bodyguard. You see any photos of Mei Ling talking to anybody? Anyone or anything that doesn't look quite right? No. Why? Think she was in on it? I don't know, but I need you to help me find her. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's him. That's the guy who was blackmailing Coco. X24. That's the biggest paparazzi agency in Hollywood. Okay. I'll email them a picture to see if they can I.D. him. Great. Then you can tell me how Mei Ling cuffed you to that bike rack. Fisher? Yeah, don't touch anything. Let me call it in. It looks like his camera was taken. (shuffling) Oh, hi. Remember me? She doesn't know who killed the paparazzo. Ask her why he wanted money from Coco. What did he have on her? Um, she says you're not the boss of her. Maggie : I'm also not the one facing years of prison and shame, either. We can't help you if you don't help us find Coco's killer. Hey, let me take a crack at it. Fisher, we don't work that way. What? No, sometimes a cop rolls up his sleeves 'cause he wants his sleeves rolled up. Oh. Okay, go for it. In private, if I may. Take it from here. You too, Alex. Thanks. Okay. We both know you speak English. So let's get that out of the way. It's your life, but you didn't give me the slip to avoid prison or get redemption. Someone killed your friend. You want revenge. I want justice. Coco was like a sister to me. I would do anything to protect her. Then why did you drink yourself unconscious the night she was killed? I didn't. I don't drink. Someone poisoned the water in my room. Well, your toxicology report isn't back yet, so why should I believe you? Believe whatever you want. What is this place? A government facility. The Chinese authorities are coming for you. They'll be here in... just under 16 hours. After that, my ability to help you is over. I don't need your help. Yes, you do. Who did that photographer catch in that picture with Coco? Who did she go off to meet? She didn't tell me she was seeing someone. I have no idea who her lover is or who would want to kill her. Her husband? He's an old man. Old men get jealous. Well, maybe he was jealous of the time her work took away from seeing him, but he knew how talented Coco was. He was banking on her. So Coco was his investment? Yeah, and a profitable one. He was not going to hurt her. Well, then who would? I don't know, but I need to find them. Will you help me? Now you're speaking my language. 
 
 (phone ringing) (man on phone speaking) (man on phone speaks Chinese) Elizabeth Brown? This is her mother. Who is this? May I please speak with her? She passed away six years ago. I'm so sorry. Uh, do you, by any chance, know if your daughter knew a man named Daniel Stinger? Hello? (hangs up) I will take that as a yes. Whoa, hey, where's the fire? Sorry. I, uh, I... I just found my Elizabeth Brown. Oh! When you gonna talk to her? Uh, never. She died a few years ago. But her mother hung up on me when I mentioned Stinger, so... So we'll just do dinner another night. Dinner. Nina. Right. You know, we can do it another time or not at all. Look, you really don't have to. No, no, I want to. I'm looking forward to meeting Nina. Are you sure? What about your lead? It doesn't matter. I will go grocery shopping for dinner. Any requests? Not burnt. Okay. Any luck hacking the paparazzo's cloud account? No. Apparently the stalker also didn't believe in storing photos in the cloud. His camera was missing from the crime scene. Most likely stolen by the paparazzo's killer. Whatever was in those photos is what got Coco killed. When's the refractory period up? Tomorrow morning. Stitching again should give us more info on the photos. So we have the night off? Uh, yeah. Unless something else comes up. Oh, hey, do you want to go to Spinella's? It's still early, we can get a table. Oh, god, yeah, about dinner. Don't hate me, I have a huge optogenetics test this week. Oh, so come over. You study, I cook. I have to use the reference section at the library. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. It's fine. Better go before all the good tables with outlets fill up. Good luck. Hey, what's up, Fish? This is Mei Ling. Oh, Mei Ling. It's very nice to meet you. Knock it off, dude, she speaks English. Oh. My bad. Sorry to spring this on you, but can we crash here tonight? What is it about my apartment that everyone wants to crash here? Your apartment only has one door. If she decides to run again, there's only one way out. Yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem. Um, make yourself at home, Mei Ling. I am headed out, but you two have fun. There's food in the fridge, just don't put your feet up on the coffee table, okay? I'm not an animal. Talking to Fisher. I just don't want you to be nervous, is all. She is your co-worker, why would I be nervous? She just used to be... socially awkward. Wait, are you nervous about me meeting her? No! No, it's fine. Everything's gonna be fine. I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (knocking) (chuckles) Hi! Hello! It's so lovely to meet you. It's so great to meet... (laughing) You go. No, you go. Oh, my gosh, okay. Now that we've met, can we eat? Yeah, come in. Let's eat. Thank you so much for having us over. That was the perfect dinner. (laughs) Mmm, yeah. Interesting choice. Pancakes. Well, unlike some people, my skills in the kitchen are limited, so... If you came over to my place, I'd make you fish fingers and custard. Mmm... It's a  Doctor Who  thing. She's obsessed. Uh, but yes, I have been known to throw together a decent meal. Please. He is such a foodie. Have you had his world-famous habanero salsa yet? Not yet. Holding out on me, huh? It was pretty spicy. I don't know if you could handle it. I can handle it. I like spicy. Okay. Bring it. Though, to be honest, I'm happy you can't cook. Oh... Okay, no, no, no, no, no. That came out wrong. I mean that you're not some world-class chef. I mean, you can't be perfect at everything. Oh, god, trust me, I am so far from perfect. You wouldn't know that by the way this guy talks about you. This brilliant, accomplished, very tall woman. You said that? Just the part about you being tall. No. He said all of it. Come on. He really loves working with you. Well, I feel the same way about him. That is super sweet. Well, we should quit while I'm ahead. Point me to the bathroom first? Oh, it's just down the hall. Thank you. So? So... she's great. Really. Cameron, she's lovely. What's not to like? I don't know. I just want to make sure you're good with all this? Does Nina make you happy? Yeah. Then I'm good. Nina : Whoa! Oh, the door was open. I'm sorry. It's okay. What is all this? All what? Wha... Kirsten : I was inspired about something for work. Couldn't find any scrap paper? You said Kirsten was smart, but who knew? Yeah. Who knew? Well, I'm glad you talked me out of ordering... What? You know. Chinese food? (laughing) Yeah. Why would you want to eat that in Los Angeles? Pizza is better. You know, if you want the real deal pizza, you gotta go to New York. Well, New York... would have been the last stop on our tour. You were drugged. It wasn't your fault. Excuses won't matter to Coco's husband. He hired me to keep her safe. You think they really loved each other? Pfft. How would I know? In my country, it is forbidden for a bodyguard to be in a relationship. Love is considered dangerous to both my safety and the safety of my employer. For me, love is more of a distraction. Actually, the lack of love. My wife, she... She didn't like the kind of cop I was. So she told me I either had to change or lose her. What kind of cop were you? Relentless. What kind of cop are you now? The same. Just divorced. Mmm. You just need to find someone who's more understanding. I'm working on it. It's all yours. We can share. (laughing) Hey. Hey, thanks for coming tonight. Oh, it was fun. And how interesting was that wall in Kirsten's room? Yeah. Yeah, that was, um, pretty interesting. So, how'd I do? Does Kirsten approve? It wasn't about that? Yeah, she approves. Well, I think she's awesome. And I hope I get to know her better. Yeah, that'd be great. I think. (laughing) I would invite you over to my place tonight, but I know you have to work tomorrow. Yeah. I do. Yeah. But... that's tomorrow. This is unnecessary. I don't want you to be... If Kirsten's awake. The lights are off. Kirsten's asleep. Well, okay. You walked me home, I'm here, you can leave. Oh. Just tell me one thing. Did you have a good time? Yes. I had...  I had a good time. I don't know how you have enough money for the most expensive Italian restaurant in Los Angeles, but... I'm allowed to have refined tastes. Of course you are. You, I just picture, you know, somewhere exotic. Like, sitting in the dirt by a fire pit. Believe it or not, I'm not opposed to occasionally using a chair. But one must not get too comfortable. Comfort leads to complacency, which leads to stagnation, which leads to death. Ugh. What are you, a nihilistic greeting card? I don't think I've ever heard anything as brooding and intense. And I've had quite enough of that the past few months. How's Kirsten's friend Cameron doing? Are they still friends? Um, yeah. Far as I know. He's seeing someone else. Really? Kirsten seeing anyone else, too? Woof. You have absolutely no game. Could you be any more obvious? Just a casual question. I thought you were over her? I am. I'm just curious. Lord, that accent makes even the cheesiest lies sound charming. You're the one with the accent. Oh, I could stay like this all night. Well, perhaps you have more game than I originally thought. Good night. You sure? Good night. Guess you didn't run after all. Morning, doc. Yup. You okay? Yup. You? On a scale of one to 10, I'm a 42. Well, isn't that just special for you? Oof. You look tired. Were you up all night working on that Stringer board? Yup. Where's Camille? I'm not sure. Maybe she overslept? I heard her get in really late. She told me she had to study last night. Hmm. What's up with Linus? What's up with you? Me? You're annoyingly chipper this morning. Well, I'm sorry, I had a really good time last night. All right? Thank you for being, you know, so open and friendly to Nina. By the way, she's really sorry about going in your room. Yup. You ready to go? We are indeed,  Mon capitaine. You got some last night, didn't you? A gentleman does not disclose such information. That being said, your CIA skills have not failed you. Lights at 20% please. I need a go/no-go for stitch neurosync. Life-Sci? Go. Medical? Go. Sub-bio? Alex : Go. Engineering? Go. Communications? Go. Comm check. (beat-boxes) I hear you, Chippy McChipperson. Please don't ever do that again. I'll let that one slide. Okay, guys, here we go. Sit tight, hold the fort, keep the home fires burning. And if we're not back by dawn... call the President. Induce stitch neurosync on my mark. In three, two, one, mark. Yeah, but this happened because you went out without my protection. I don't need you with me every second of my life. That is my job! Where are you, Susie Q? I'm in Coco's dressing room again. Wait, stand by. The monitor's detecting some sort of emotional token. It's really strong. Where are you at now? I'm in a greenhouse. Coco's with an older man. Can she I.D. him? Can you get any closer, Kirsten? He works here, he's a gardener. He's not her lover, he's her father. Camille? Where's Camille? She's not here, but I'm on it. (typing) Coco's father is a man named De Deshei. He's in prison in China for insider trading at Son Industries. Okay, no, it can't be her father, Kirsten. He's in a Chinese prison. Can you get a better look at who she's with? I can feel Coco's connection to him. He's definitely her father. And he works at this nursery. (speaking Chinese) I beg you to believe me. I was set up. I'm innocent. Year after year you say you are innocent. Why should I believe you now? (speaking Chinese) Kirsten : He's giving her a pendant. Is it jade? Is it jade? Yeah. We have it here. Coco was wearing it when they brought her in. This was great-grandmother's. I cannot take it. Yes, you can. You must do something for me. If someone comes and threatens you to tell them where I am, you tell them. Hey! Shh. (computers beeping rapidly) This makes no sense. Maggie : Linus what are you seeing? Linus : It's an anomaly. It's the same schism from before. Cameron? I'm here. Kirsten, comm check, one-two, one-two. Okay, we've lost contact, Linus, what's going on? I don't know. The system is registering some sort of foreign entity. It must be some sort of errant code. I want it tracked down. Me too. Talk to me, Kirsten, what's happening? Don't say anything. Remember, everyone in the lab can hear you. Just think your words, I'll understand them. Am I imagining you? No. I'm a construct built by a friend of yours. What friend? Someone who cares about you, but can't tell you. Cameron? I can't tell you. Not yet. Kirsten, comm check, one-two. So why do you look like Cameron when he was a boy? I was created in the form of someone your subconscious trusts. This was hopefully you'll be predisposed to trust me too. You can't be real. There's something waiting for you on your doorstep. When you go home and see what it is, you'll know I am. Hey, what happened? Where'd you go? We lost you for 30 seconds. It was right when the anomaly happened. How are you feeling? I'm fine. I'm fine. Coco's father. De Deshei? Yeah. He works at a Chinese nursery in Arcadia. How do you know it's a Chinese nursery? I read the characters on his uniform. I'm gonna call Fisher. (computer beeping) We're on our way. Whoever killed Coco was actually after her father. De Deshei? Yeah. You know him? But he's in a Chinese prison. No, he isn't. Coco met with him, and the killer was trying to find him through her. If the killer finds out where De Deshei is, then De Deshei is a dead man. Wait, wait, wait, this is my town, we're gonna do this my way. Until your way doesn't work. Then we do it my way. Fair enough. (speaking Chinese) Fisher : Police! Mei Ling! Mei Ling! Let him go. Stay down. Fisher : You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Hey, hey, hey! Sorry we're late. Totally would have helped. (police radio chatter) So Bo Cheng was pretending to be part of an undercover Chinese police task force called "Operation Snow Dragon," but was really being paid by Mr. Wu to kill Coco's father to cover up Wu's insider trading. So Coco's father was the fall guy. Cameron : Yeah. You and Mei Ling saved his life. Mr. De? I am so sorry for you loss. I want you to know that your daughter wasn't ashamed of you anymore. She... She knew you were innocent. I want to believe that, but how do you know? Coco believed you. Come on. Bo Cheng's been taken into custody. You've been cleared of any wrongdoing. Yeah, maybe officially, but my lapse of duty resulted in Coco being killed. I'll always carry that with me. Hey. You and I protect people for a living. No matter how good we are or how often we win, we're never gonna win all the time. Forgive yourself. Don't let this moment define the rest of your life. Thank you for believing in me. Well, if I come back to Los Angeles again, maybe I can let you take me out for some authentic Chinese food? (both chuckle) Yeah. Goodbye, Detective Fisher. Goodbye, Mei Ling. Hey, Kirsten, wait up. That was... That was really nice what you did for Mr. De. You sound surprised? What did you expect? Honestly, I don't know what to expect from you. You're all over the place, all right? And it's starting to worry me. All right, what happened in that stitch when you went silent? Nothing. Really? I'm pretty sure it was something, okay? You saw something. Was it that boy in that red baseball cap again? Okay, you really gotta learn when to let it go. You wanna discuss that wall in your bedroom? Kirsten, I'm worried. Yeah. You already said that. You can be honest with me, all right? Whatever is going on, you can let me in. (elevator dings) I can take care of myself, okay? Go to Nina. She's the one who needs you. Hey. Hey. What's the matter, big guy? Buy you a slice and a glass of Chianti? Turn that frown upside down? You weren't at the University library last night. What? Of course I was. Really? Because I spent two hours cooking you dinner because I didn't want you to go hungry while you were studying. I then drove to Cal Tech to drop the food off at the library, and you weren't there. Linus, I was in a private study room in the back. You should have texted... Straight up. Were you there? (sighs) No.
