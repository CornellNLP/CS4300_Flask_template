 You are under suspicions for a very serious crime. 
 They can lock you up for jaywalking. 
 He didn't kill George Melton and he's not going down for it. 
 Just say it, Tawney. Go for it. 
 I don't know if I want to be married to you. 
 What about Trey Willis or those other assholes? 
 They have motive. They always have. 
 There's not even a mention of Christopher Nelms in Hanna's files. 
 I'm not gonna apologize for being worried for the safety of my family. 
 I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny. 
 [Bird chirping] 
 [Door rattles] 
 ♪♪ 
 [Knock on door] 
 Is Daniel here? 
 No, he was gone when I woke up. 
 Thought he was with you. 
 No. 
 Is everything okay, Melvin? 
 Not so much. 
 Come in, Melvin. 
 You want some coffee, or...? 
 They want him to leave. 
 Who does? 
 Some of the tenants complained. 
 [Sighs] 
 I-I-I told them it's just for a couple weeks. 
 And then, he won't even be in town anymore. 
 Or the... Or the state, even. 
 What did they say to that? 
 Went over my head. 
 Talked to Porter, the czar. 
 And what did Porter say? 
 He said that Daniel's not on the lease, and... 
 He can't live in certain places. 
 He's not a s*x offender, Melvin. 
 I told that to Porter. 
 I said this whole plea deal is just a giant, cosmic joke. 
 Went right over his head. 
 You know, screw them and their pitchforks. 
 I hate this job anyway. 
 Melvin. 
 No, you got to stand for something, right? 
 Melvin. 
 And then, some butthole poured paint into the pool. 
 What? 
 Couple cans, at least. 
 Does Daniel know? 
 It's hard to miss. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know, screw Porter and his rules. 
 Melvin, you're a good friend to Daniel, but this is not your fight. 
 I mean, it's not really  a  fight, you know? 
 Daniel's not on the lease, and if they want him to go... 
 No, no, and I'm not gonna do it this time. 
 If you want to quit your job, Melvin, quit your job. 
 But don't put this on Daniel, okay? 
 He would... Hate that, you know, that he could cause you to lose your job? 
 Will he be all right? 
 We'll figure something out. 
 I just worry about him. 
 Of course. 
 I-I've been reading about solitary confinement, the psychological impact, and you can't do that to somebody and then just turn them loose... 
 When does he need to leave, Melvin? 
 Porter said he'd like it by the end of the day today. 
 Like, in "today" today? 
 Which, in my book, is midnight, and not one minute before that. 
 Okay, well... um... 
 Right now, I've got to go to work. 
 But I'll make some calls, and [Sighs] talk to Daniel when I get home. 
 And then we'll... Go somewhere. 
 Why don't you leave first, then I'll go? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 Not supposed to smoke in here. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door opens] 
 I'm glad you could come back today. 
 I think it's important after yesterday's session. 
 Tawney running late? 
 She didn't call you? 
 No. 
 I don't think she's gonna be coming in here today, Rebecca. 
 I went by the Mitchersons' this morning, and Beth said she was gone. 
 Gone? 
 Took all of her things. 
 Beth say where? 
 Not to me. 
 Did something happen yesterday after you left? 
 Yeah, a whole lot happened. 
 Okay. 
 Ending with us parked outside the Mitchersons', making out in the truck. 
 I see. 
 To be honest, I wish we hadn't have done it. 
 Why is that? 
 I really did feel relief yesterday... 
 After Tawney said what she said. 
 I mean, I'm not saying it didn't hurt, but... 
 I just didn't realize how much I'd been carrying around. 
 How much what? 
 Fear. 
 Obsession. Insecurity. 
 All the above. 
 And now it's all back, back roosting in my brain. 
 What are you afraid of, Ted? 
 What am I afraid of, Rebecca? 
 I'm afraid I'm never gonna kiss her again, never gonna hold her, sleep next to her. 
 I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her for good. 
 And what would happen if you did? 
 I'll die a long, slow death. 
 Not sure about that. 
 Okay, well... I'm gonna feel all kinds of stuff I don't want to feel. 
 "Mommy and Daddy" stuff. 
 All kinds of stuff. 
 What's going on, Ted for some time now, I've had these... 
 I don't know what the right word is. 
 "Insights" or "premonitions." 
 About what? 
 That Tawney might not be the right girl for me. 
 I don't know. 
 But really, maybe the cold, hard truth is [sighs] I'm not the right guy for her. 
 Just not good for her. 
 And if I'm not, I'm not, no matter what I do. 
 I don't know about that, either. 
 Damn, Rebecca. What are you getting paid for? 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't think she knows what's right of her yet. 
 She's still forming. 
 She got a lot to deal with. 
 That was some childhood she had. 
 ♪♪ 
 I feel really bad for her, growing up like that. 
 Kind of hard to think about it, really. 
 It's called "empathy," Ted. 
 How 'bout that? 
 We're all damaged, Ted. 
 Tawney just got an extra dose. 
 This one's a runner. 
 I was abused. I'm damaged goods. 
 [Indistinct shouting in distance] 
 Lord, they pick up on them labels, don't they? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Little pitchers have big ears. 
 They still do. 
 Girl 1 : Oh, my God! You're so annoying! 
 Girl 2 : No, you are! 
 [Sighs] Better stop World War III up there. 
 Get out of my room! 
 You  get out of  my  room! 
 Get out! 
 Why?! 
 How long you been staying with Miss Kathy? 
 Year. 
 You get kicked out somewhere? 
 No. 
 You're  choosing  to be here? 
 For now. 
 Why would you want to come back to the sticks voluntarily? 
 Kind of miss it sometimes. 
 What's here to miss? 
 The future. 
 When I used to lie upstairs in my bed at night, I'd dream about how... 
 Things would be better when I grew up, when I made my own home and had my own life. 
 And you'd live happily ever after? 
 Something like that. 
 I already know that's bullshit. 
 [Chuckles] 
 That might be the better approach. 
 I think my mom's gonna, you know, get her sh1t together. 
 I'll go back to her in a couple months, I bet. 
 I really hope that happens for you, rose. 
 What about your mom? 
 I-I never really knew my mom. 
 Really? 
 That's weird. 
 She drop you off at the orphanage? 
 Something like that. 
 ♪♪ 
 That sucks. 
 It does kind of suck. 
 [Tires screech] 
 - Gracias. 
 De nada. People suck. I-I'm just sick about this. Me, too. You bought paint already? I did. I'll reimburse you for it. That's not necessary. I'm paying you for this extra work, too. It won't take but a few hours. That's not even up for discussion. I did it, Melvin. What? The paint. Last night. The can... Just knocked it over. Well, these... These things happen. No, they don't. I'm sorry, Daniel. Me, too. I still want to pay you for the paint. I-I don't... I-I can't do that. Wouldn't be good. I'll tell you this much. It's gonna look great, Daniel, when you're finished. Like brand-new. You can walk away from here knowing that. That'd be nice. Well... I'll leave you to it. ♪♪ Coffee? Please. Decisions, decisions. Do you remember a man named "Bilko"? Bilko... Like Sergeant Bilko. Sorry. Well, he used to work here. It was a long time ago. I guess he was old even then. [Chuckles] What'd he do? Slowly killed people, one fried egg at a time. Mm. Time marches on. Murphy's doesn't. [Chuckles] Want a little longer? My husband used to love this place. My first husband. He made coming here seem like an adventure. To Murphy's? To anywhere. That's a gift. It certainly was. Yes, a little longer. Thank you. You made good time. I got lucky. Thanks for seeing me today, Dr. Nelms. Of course. Uh, and it's "Chris." Come on in. Thank you, Chris. We're investigating the death of George Melton. He was found with a bullet hole in his head, floating on the flint river. It's tragic. First time you're hearing this? No, but it's still... It's tragic. You ever see or talk to any of the old crew? The old crew? Like George, for example. Or Trey Willis. Daniel Holden. Well, [Exhales deeply] I... I don't know that Daniel Holden was ever a part of the old crew, or that there was even an old crew. [Chuckles] But to your point, no, I haven't spoken to Daniel Holden since... Since high school. Did you know he'd gotten out of prison? I did, yes. What about Trey Willis? Uh, probably talked to Trey 5 or 10 years ago. Not a very fine point. Well, time gets away from you when you get older. [Chuckles] I guess so, since Trey's phone records show that he called you less than two months ago. Well, that's true, but h-he just left a message. We didn't have an actual conversation. What was the message? Just call him back. I never did. What about George? George called me about the same time, I think, a-as Trey did. It looks like it was three days before, to put a real fine point on it, Chris. Was that an actual conversation? It was, yeah. And what the gist? To be Frank... Please. It was about Daniel Holden getting out of prison. H-he... George was... He was agitated. Agitated? He was rambling, actually. Rambling about what? [Exhales deeply] I-I think he was worried about, uh... Holden getting out. Why would he be worried about that? 'Cause it brought up old feelings, I guess. Why would George call  you  about old feelings? We had been friends, at one time. Was he worried that Holden might hurt him? I don't know, maybe. That Holden might shoot him in the head and toss him in the flint river? That kind of worried? It's hard to say. 'Cause that type of suggestion's very damning, Chris. And if it's not true... No, wait, wait, wait. Sheriff, I'm not suggesting that. What was George worried about, Chris? Really? Well... H-he didn't get into it with me. Didn't get into what he was worried about with you? Unfortunately, no. Do you see yourself as a good man, Chris? A good man? In general. I don't know. I have a... a family that I love... very much. And I work very hard to provide for them. Church-going man? Yeah. I go to church. Well, there's some positives in the ledger, isn't there? I would hope so. Did you know it was almost 20 years before they tested that DNA found on Hanna Dean? I knew it was a long time. Lucky there was still something to test, really. Lot of that old evidence gets lost or thrown out or sometimes just plain vanishes. Well, that was lucky. As you probably know, Holden was cleared. Was cleared? Of rape. His DNA wasn't found on Hanna. Right. That surprise you as much as it did me? Yeah, it was surprising. But then what really surprised me almost as much was... Trey Willis. He was cleared, too. Like to go ahead and clear you, too, Chris, while I'm in the neighborhood. Sheriff, don't take this the wrong way... But I think I should call a lawyer. Sure, Chris. No more, please. So, what's the verdict? Plentiful. Our first mandate. And comforting. And good. Just what the doctor ordered. [Chuckles] What was your husband's name? Lester. [Chuckles] I know. But he loved it. So did I. Sounds like a special fellow. Well, one tends to idealize after... He died of a heart attack, by the way, but I won't blame it all on Murphy's. [Chuckles] I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am. You're kind. I'm Janet. Marcy. I'll have to come back a little more often, Marcy. Well, we'd love to have you, Janet. 
 
 You started back. Yeah, don't tell the kids. You don't think they already know? Of course they know. That boy saw you coming a mile away. Tawney, I told you, you got to get an education. I tell all you girls that. Yeah, I know. Or you'll find yourself stuck with some man you don't like or a job you don't like or both. I know. You come back here just to hear me lecture you again? Probably. [Chuckles] Got any money? We have a joint account. Could you stay with him just till you get a degree in something? I couldn't do that. They'll do it to you or worse. We're going to therapy. Talking about things. So, you think there's a chance that y'all can work through this? I don't know. Have you prayed on it? Some. Not much. Now, look... I don't know what to tell you to do, Tawney, but you can stay here a little while, if you want. There's a vacant bed with them two hormonal wonders. That'll get you motivated to do something. Ain't the end of the world, okay? Sure feels like it sometimes. You always did feel things hard. It's your cross to bear. Great. [Chuckles] You let them kids pick up their own toys, okay? [Door opens, shuts] I don't think there's a vacancy. Sheriff would like to talk to you. You want your barrister present? Is that allowed in these here parts? [Sighs] I tell you what. How about we do this  mano y mano ? You offering a car service too, deputy? Sure, hope in. Daggett : Just want to clear a few things up. [Chuckles] What's so funny? The joke in my head. What was Trey wearing on your road trip? Clothes. Can you be more specific? No. How about a jacket? I don't know, but then again, my memory is like me... Suspect. Did he bring anything with him on the trip? Like a gun? Did he bring a gun? You want me to say he brought a gun? I don't want you to say anything that you didn't see or hear, Daniel. That's the problem, Sheriff. Even that's uncertain. It's a memory, not a fact. Well, if you're not sure about something, just say you're not sure. How about that? Sure. Trey said you were wearing a jacket. That's a lie. I know it is. It was George Melton's DNA, the single sample. ♪♪ I don't what game you're playing today, Sheriff. I believe George raped Hanna, Daniel. And I feel pretty confident that Trey and Chris Nelms and maybe others had s*x with her, too, against her will. Maybe not initially, but like you said in the debrief. And I believe it's their DNA in that mixed sample that was tested. We just don't have the science yet to single them out. And when you got out of prison, I think George started worrying and started talking to the others about confession again. A-again? What do you mean, "again"? George went to C.J. Pickens right after your trial, but C.J. Wouldn't talk to him. I think George wanted to come clean, even back then. And I think he was gonna do it this time, really do it. And I think Trey Willis decided to shut him up before he got them all in a whole mess of trouble. I don't think you killed George Melton. I think it was Trey. You understand me? You're not here as a suspect, Daniel. You're here as a witness. T-that's a lot of leaps, Sheriff. Then help me build the bridges. Bridges to what? Trey's conviction? To the truth. A-and what happens if you don't find the truth, Sheriff? The whole truth and nothing but? I just keep looking till I do. Trey had a bag. [Rap music playing] Jared : Yes? Can I come in? Okay. [Music stops] [Door opens] I got some cookies from Banyons. That's cool. What have you been up to? Reading. With that music on? Sure. God, I can't even read in the quiet any more. You're old. Jared. It's harder to concentrate when you get older. You never complain, do you? Yes, I do. Well, not to me. You want to complain to me? What's going on, mom? What do you mean? That right there. What's going on with you and Dad, with Teddy and Daniel, with all of it? [Sighs] Just feels like everybody thinks I'm better off not knowing stuff. Or maybe nobody cares about me enough to tell me. Of course we care. I'm scared to ask 'cause you're so freaked out all the time, mom. First, I love you very much. But I can see how you might feel that way. No problem. I just... Can you give me a couple weeks? Until Daniel's settled in his new place. And then I'll tell you all of it. I promise. Just don't forget. The front door of the trailer was locked? Oh, he said it was. I-I didn't check. So, then he goes around to the back. Yes. The next thing I knew, he was opening the front door from the inside. What about the duffel bag? I-it was still in the truck. So he didn't bring the duffel bag inside? Not then, no. But later? After he thought I was asleep. Or passed out or whatever he thought. So, he goes outside, gets the duffel bag and brings it inside? That's leading, Sheriff. Well, you tell me, then. He goes outside and gets the duffel bag and brings it inside. Okay. Then what? He goes to George's bedroom for a while. And that's where you found the wallet? The next morning, yes. Did you see him with the phone, or see him place it somewhere? No. It was just on the coffee table when I woke up. The coffee table? Yes. Are you sure? No. I-it was in George's bedroom, near... near the wallet. And that's when you picked it up? Both of them, yes. ♪♪ [Cellphone rings] Man : TVs these days are sometimes the biggest energy hog in the house. [Cellphone beeps] Hello? Ted : It's me. I know. You okay? I'm okay. I love you, Tawney. Yeah, I know. And I wish I was better for you. Me too. [Sniffles] Me for you. I been thinking, and I got kind of an idea. I know, scary proposition. I want you to come back. Teddy, I-I don't think... Just hear me out. I want you to come back to the house, and I'll move out. I'll leave all the keys with you, and I promise I won't come over unless you ask me to. You said that before. I know I did. I know. You stay as long as you like until you figure things out for yourself, whenever that is. Well... Where will you go? Don't worry about that. I got options. I think I'm gonna stay at Miss Kathy's for a while. Okay. She's got a spare bed. That's good. Might be exactly where you need to be. Might be. But if that doesn't work out for you, or you just need more space or whatever, my offer still stands. No strings attached. That's very generous of you, Teddy. You're not alone, Tawney. Got to go. [Cellphone beeps] [Gate rattles] Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Snuck back in the pool on me. I'm sneaky. It's beautiful, Danny. I'm revisiting my blue period. [Chuckles] I have some shitty news. Okay. You have to move out. Some of the tenants went over Melvin's head. You're not on the lease. I'm sorry. When? Tonight. They don't like the color? Guess not. Sheriff Daggett doesn't think I killed George. Well, that's encouraging. Yeah. Especially since I didn't. Maybe they find the real killer this time. Sheriff certainly thinks so. Not our problem, is it? I'd like to finish the pool before I go. Melvin said tonight meant midnight. Plenty of time. Daniel can't stay at Amantha's anymore. You can stay at Teddy's if you don't want to be here, but Daniel's coming home. I understand. I'm so sorry for what happened to you, Teddy. My heart breaks every time I think about it. For you. My heart breaks for you, Teddy. But my heart breaks for my other son, too. Because no matter what or your dad or anybody else thinks, Daniel's not a bad person. He's a sick person. He's a damaged person. But he's not bad. And he's had such a raw deal, his life. So I'm gonna help him. As much as I can, as much as he'll let me, so that he has a chance. That's all. Just like the rest of us, if we're lucky. Jon : I don't believe it. Daniel : Me neither. No, I don't believe you didn't call me, Daniel, after all we talked about. I know, Jon. I have no good explanation. Amantha : Hey. It all worked out. Yeah, it sure seems like it. Still wish I'd been there. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. It's a curious gift. What's that? Tennessee sent over Daniel's reporting instructions. They approved his transfer. I'm not sure I want to live in a state that'll have me. I know the feeling. That's good, Jon. Thank you. Glad to be of service somehow. Hey, y'all. May we join you? Of course. Uh, grab a chair. What's going on? Are we celebrating something? Well, I'm nearly finished painting the pool. And, evidently, Sheriff Daggett doesn't think Daniel's a suspect in George Melton's murder. Our sheriff Daggett? Yes, uncharacteristically. It turns out there might be one other person in Paulie who could've committed a crime. I think I will have a beer. Hey, Jared. Hey, Daniel. Glad you could join us for such a festive occasion. [Chuckles] Me too. I've always wanted to watch paint dry. Big sport in Finland. Shall we toast Sheriff Daggett? No. Sheriff. Mind stepping out here for a minute, Trey? What's going on, Carl? We've got a warrant to search your house. What? You carrying? No, I'm not carrying, Carl. Can you put your hands up? Need to pat you down. I just said I'm not carrying, Carl. We got to follow procedure, Trey. Am I under arrest? No, you're not. You want to stay here while we do this? Of course I do. Gonna need you to stay with your family in the front room till after we search it. Patty, we've got company. This is nice. It is. Could we leave in the morning, Mother? Leave? Paulie. I-is that allowed? Well, I've been banished, Mother, so I think it's allowed. I just meant... With the sheriff... It's over, Mother. Over. I was gonna have a party for you. I'd rather just go, I think. If you don't mind. You and me. A road trip. A road trip. I wouldn't mind seeing the ocean again, Mother. Why not? Why not? [Laughs] [Television playing indistinctly] [Sighs] Rusty : Come on, boy. You got it. I don't like "Squidbillies", Daddy. Hush your mouth, girl. That's sacrilegious. Whoo! Punch it! Come on! Early : What? What in the hell are you doing? [Chuckles] What's going on, Trey? It's nothing, Patty. Sheriff's just ruling things out. What's he looking for? Something that ain't here. Why? I'm trying to keep up with the plot. Round 'em up. [Laughs] [Television continues indistinctly] ♪♪ [Chuckling]
