 Honey, what time are Kent and Joon coming over? 
 Around 2:00. 
 You almost ready? 
 Just about. 
 Okay. 
 We need to get propane after church. 
 Sure thing, hon. 
 What's going on, Teddy? 
 Just watching TV, Tawney. 
 Is this still about the loan paperwork? 
 Could've had a little more faith in me. 
 That's why I signed it. 
 Eventually. 
 I just... I needed a little bit of time to think about it. 
 The one time I ask you to trust me, you got to think about it? 
 See, I'm still a little mad. 
 Is there something else going on? 
 Let me in, Teddy. 
 Just talk to me, honey. 
 I still can't get over what you told me about you and Daniel. 
 I thought I could, but I can't just snap my fingers and get it out of my head. 
 I'm sorry. It's stuck in there. 
 Thank you for being honest with me. 
 Now, why does everything got to be so goddamn polite in this relationship?! 
 Do you want me to start talking like you, Teddy? 
 [Remote thuds] 
 That make you happy? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm gonna go to church. 
 If you think of it, take the fruit salad out in an hour. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Refrigerator door opens] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Drawer opens, closes] 
 [Cabinet opens, closes] 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Hello, Mother. 
 Janet : Hey, sweetheart. 
 Ted and I are gonna go to the movies tonight. 
 Thought you might want to join us. 
 I'm pretty busy, Mother. 
 That's good. 
 Packing. 
 Oh! 
 Did you say packing? 
 Amantha? 
 Yes, mother, packing... up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Honey, maybe I shouldn't have said that about Atlanta. 
 No, mother, you were right. 
 I don't belong here, no offense. 
 Might be nice to get back to your friends, huh? 
 I didn't think of [Sighs] making any real friends while I was there, except with Daniel's lawyer. 
 Always thought it was temporary. 
 Then... then stay here for a while longer. 
 Why not? 
 God, Mom. 
 I know, honey. I'm sorry. 
 [Slow-tempo music plays] 
 [Man singing in native language] 
 What do you think? 
 What do I think? 
 Um, well, I... I think I have looked at this painting for so long in a... in a book that somehow my brain has... has trivialized it. 
 And, uh, now as I stand here in front of the real thing, uh, I feel, if anything... disappointment. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 Well, n... not at the painting itself... more at my brain I guess. 
 I think the brain's afraid of being in a state of constant wonder. 
 It's for safety reasons or something. 
 [Chuckles] I suppose this is inevitable. 
 Usually by the time we're four. 
 Then there's the... the issue of great expectations. 
 Something the brain doesn't seem the least bit interested in protecting us from. 
 [Chuckles] No. 
 Well, I think we should reinstate wonder, banish expectation. 
 I concur. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 We're moving on, dear. 
 One of the things I try to do is imagine myself in the exact moment of the artist's life before the paint even dries on the canvas or when that last note is written or final sentence crafted. 
 That does wonders for wonder. 
 Sound advice. 
 Well, I don't always succeed, but... 
 [Both laugh] 
 I'm Peggy. 
 Donald. 
 Hi, Donald. 
 Good to meet you. 
 Enjoy. 
 Woman : Can I help you? 
 Large diet coke, please. 
 Anything else, Ma'am? 
 Ma'am? 
 It's all twisted. 
 [Chuckling] I got it, mama. Don't worry. 
 Stupid thing. 
 It gets stuck sometimes. 
 There. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 [Van door closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Peggy : Oh. Oh. 
 [Laughs] Donald. 
 Donald! 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 Come over. Come on. 
 Come... come join us. 
 I... I don't want to impose. 
 Impose? How gallant. 
 Well, you must sit with us now. 
 Besides, we ordered too much wine, anyway. 
 [Laughs] Donald, these are my friends. 
 Florene... 
 ... Anna Lewis, and Hazel. 
 Hello, Donald. 
 Hello. 
 Maybe he's in that group. 
 Florene : A.A.? 
 Donald, are you in A.A.? 
 Uh, no. 
 Well, thank God. 
 We've lost so many to them. 
 [Laughter] 
 Are you from Atlanta, Donald? 
 Uh, no, I'm not. 
 How mysterious. 
 Enough with the questions. It sounds like an interrogation. 
 Hazel : Where he's from? 
 How is that inappropriate? 
 I'm from Alabama, actually. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 May we ask what he does, Peggy, or is that verboten, too? 
 I own a bookstore there. 
 Why does that not surprise me? 
 It's small. 
 Well, maybe you could recommend something for our book club. 
 Well... we just read "The Mermaid Chair." 
 Did you not just hate it? 
 To be honest, I... 
 The protagonist... so pitiful. 
 There is no point in telling stories about people who are perfect. 
 Well [Scoffs] up to a point, but, Peggy, come on. 
 What did you think, Donald? 
 Um, well, it's... it's always subjective, isn't it? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, at least say you hated the monk. 
 Please. 
 I didn't care for him, no. 
 Thank you. 
 This bread is, um... is excellent. 
 It's, um, different. 
 The panini bread? 
 Yes. 
 The palini... it's, um... it's unusually fresh here. 
 Am I the only one who is over panini bread? 
 [Chuckles] Panini bread. 
 Mm. 
 Woman over P.A. : We need a cleanup on aisle 3, please. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Hello, Mother. 
 That's nice of you to offer, but I already ate. 
 What'd I eat? 
 A salad. 
 No, it was filling. 
 It had cheese on it... cheese and croutons. 
 No, Mother, I still don't want to go to the movies tonight. 
 Enjoying my solitude. 
 You know, practicing. 
 Alesha, could you get on register two please? 
 Hold on, Mom. Thanks. 
 Do you have any moving supplies? 
 Uh, we have packing tape on the endcap. 
 Bubble wrap? 
 Ugh, sorry. 
 Um, maybe Target. 
 Thanks. 
 Yep. 
 Town's so small you have to drive to Mansfield to get bubble wrap. 
 Bubble wrap, Mom. 
 Guess nobody ever moves from here. 
 I don't know if I can get my deposit back. 
 Melvin wasn't optimistic. 
 Yeah, mom, it's a lot of money to me. 
 Got to go again. 
 Hmm. Mamas. 
 Uh-huh. 
 It's $8.77. Cash or credit? 
 Credit. 
 I could be having the best day, and then I talk to my mama. 
 Heard that. 
 Now, you have a great day now. 
 There a problem? 
 Can I get an application? 
 For what? 
 For the job advertised. 
 For real? 
 Yeah. For real. 
 Okay. 
 Uh... 
 Florene : Why on earth would you memorize Tobias Wolff's "Bullet in the brain"? 
 It's a short story, Florene. 
 I don't care if it was a haiku. 
 It was sad enough to read. It'd be torture to memorize. 
 No, it was... it was calming, actually. 
 Okay. 
 More please. 
 I... I don't know why, exactly. 
 Well, it was... it was during a period of my life where I was having some difficulties dealing with the passage of time in a traditional sense. 
 And since Mr. Wolff's short story deals partly with the bending of... of time, well, in memorizing it, or... or in taking the action of memorizing it, I, too, was... was able to bend time, in a way. 
 Or at least experience it... differently. 
 Nicely defended, Donald. 
 Well, we better get a move on if we're gonna hit the gift shop. 
 Tour group leaves in 20 minutes. 
 [Women chuckle] 
 Good to meet you, Donald. 
 Oh, m... my pleasure. 
 Nice to meet you, Donald. Thank you. 
 I'll catch up with you. 
 Okay, hon. 
 Thank you. 
 Bit much sometimes, the gaggle. 
 No, no. Not at all. 
 They were... they were stimulating. 
 We never talked about music. 
 I'm curious. 
 Truthfully, I... 
 I haven't listened to much music of... of late. 
 Mostly reading. 
 Well, surely you must be a Dylan fan. 
 Well, of course. 
 I listened to him some as a teenager. 
 A teenager? Donald. 
 I'm... yeah. I know. 
 I've been meaning to get back to it. 
 I saw him when he went electric in, well, more than a few years ago. 
 Talk about the paint being still wet and alive. 
 I can only imagine. 
 Are you okay, Donald? 
 I don't mean to pry. 
 No, it's, uh... 
 I think that's perhaps for a longer conversation one day. 
 Of course. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm gonna go catch up with the girls, okay? 
 Peggy, uh... 
 Yes, Donald? 
 I really enjoyed meeting you. 
 Likewise. 
 And when I'm down in Mobile, I'll come by your bookstore. 
 I'd like that. 
 [Country music playing] 
 [Kent laughs] 
 Joon : You stop. You told them. Oh, my God! 
 It's not. It's not. That's private. 
 No, I'm the worst. 
 [Laughing] You're so bad. 
 Hi. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, Tawney. Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, baby! 
 Good. Hey. 
 Good. Kent. 
 What's up? 
 They got here a little early, so... 
 I hope that's okay. 
 We made really good time down from Hilton Head. 
 Oh, no. It's great. 
 Yeah, I told Joon we can't just show up, but Teddy said we should come on over. 
 And party's on. 
 You don't mind. Do you, babe? 
 No, of course not. 
 Joon : I asked Teddy if I could help with anything, but he said he had it all under control. 
 Mm. 
 I try. I sure do. 
 I got the propane, got the fruit salad out, and table's almost set. 
 How was Hilton Head, Joon? 
 A whirlwind. 
 Uh, let me help with something. 
 Do you want that peeled? 
 Oh, um, that'd be great. 
 Kent : Hey, buddy, you know you can get yourself a nice vacation condo for a song. 
 Ted Jr. : You getting a place? 
 Thinking about it. I'm not a big beach person. 
 [Chuckles] [Shakers clacking] 
 Hey, mind if I put these out, baby? 
 Uh, nope. They're fine. 
 Muy bueno. Oh, my God. 
 I cannot wait for your muffins to be ready. 
 Joon : [Chuckles] Stop it. 
 You need anything, babe? 
 Uh, nope. I'm all good. All right. 
 Well, I am gonna get the grill fired up. 
 Give me a little something to, uh, tide me over. 
 Kent : Now, you want some company? 
 Hey, hell yeah. Come on. 
 You two are so sweet together. He just adores you. 
 Yeah, I don't know about that. 
 Kent said when he was off at that tire conference that Teddy was all like, "Tawney this and Tawney that." 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sure Kent forgot he was married the minute he walked out the door. 
 Amantha Holden. 
 Two semesters of college. 
 Didn't take to it? 
 No, I actually liked it, but I quit to be near... to go to work in Atlanta. 
 I know you've been through a lot with your brother and so forth. 
 So almost 11 years at Atlanta Metro Gas. 
 Yeah. 
 Third of my life at old Metro. 
 Did you like it? 
 Not really. 
 Just paid the rent. You know? 
 [Chuckles] Did you ever work a register? 
 No. 
 Any experience in receiving? 
 No. 
 Stock shelves? 
 I'm pretty sure I can pick up on that. 
 I'm sure you could. Amantha, look, here's the thing. 
 Peanut's already out on baby leave, and the last girl didn't work out. 
 So we need somebody right away. 
 I'm available whenever. 
 We're not splitting the atom, okay? 
 I'm sure you could get the hang of it pretty quick. 
 But if you can't deal with customers or you get bored and quit on, then we're gonna be short-staffed and I'm gonna have to go through all this again. 
 You see what I'm saying? 
 I won't quit. [Chuckles] 
 I won't get bored. 
 I didn't get bored at Metro. 
 Well, I got bored, but I did a really good job. 
 And I know I don't have retail experience, but I'm a... a really quick learner, and... 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't know about long-term, but I need to be here right now in Paulie... for my brother. 
 Well, thank you for being honest with me. 
 Like I said, I have a few other applicants to consider, but we'll make a decision very soon. 
 Thank you for coming in. 
 That's insane, Teddy. 
 You're just one store. 
 There's no way you can compete with the big rental chains. 
 I don't have to. Nearest chain's in Macon. 
 Yeah, because there aren't enough customers around here to support a store. 
 No, they're here. 
 You just got to reach them. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Then you're on the hook when some lowlife misses a payment for $2,000 worth of chrome. 
 That's a great plan, brother. 
 The big rent-to-own chains, they're pulling in more than $150 million a year, Kent. 
 All right, they can't do that if the customers aren't paying their goddamn bills. 
 Well, you got a point. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I'm sure it's gonna be fine. 
 Fine? Hell, it's a gold mine is what it is. 
 Yeah, yeah. Sounds like it. 
 I mean, we already got the local brand awareness. 
 That's important. 
 Damn right it is. 
 [Meat sizzling] 
 [Sighs] 
 Better go get us some fresh soldiers. 
 Uh, don't trouble yourself. 
 I got to think about the drive home. 
 Ain't no trouble. I'll be right back. 
 
 
 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Can I help you? 
 I believe there was someone who, uh, o... once lived here. 
 Okay... 
 Named Kerwin. 
 Why is that your business? 
 Well, I knew him. 
 We were in prison together. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Are you Daniel? 
 I am. Yes. I... I am Daniel. 
 Mama. 
 Mama, it's... it's Kerwin's friend. 
 Woman : Who? 
 Daniel. 
 Daniel? 
 The... ma, the white man... the one who got out. 
 Lord, have mercy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Daniel, look at you, right here in my door. 
 You by yourself, Daniel? 
 I am. 
 Well, that's good. 
 That's good, isn't it? 
 It is good. 
 Can I hug you, Daniel? 
 Please. 
 Goodness gracious, and alive. 
 Here, living and breathing. 
 Hello, Stefan. 
 Stefan : How you doing? 
 The grate between our cells was like an intercom of sorts. 
 A lot of conversations, I bet. 
 He liked to keep the dialogue going. 
 [Chuckling] Oh, yeah. That was Kerwin, all right. 
 I can still hear him sometimes. 
 I heard that. 
 Oh, Kerwin carried on about you. 
 "Daniel this and Daniel that." 
 He could lift you up. 
 [Chuckles] Please. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Kerwin grew up so much in there. 
 Yes, he did. 
 In that awful place. 
 He became a man. 
 A decent man, too. 
 He was that. 
 So, how are things for you now, Daniel? 
 It's been a bit of an adjustment, but, uh, things are looking up. 
 Well, your mama must be beside herself. 
 It was a big shock for her at first, but, uh, she's... she's cautiously optimistic. 
 Well, mamas got to hold some things back, 'cause y'all... 
 [Chuckling] Yes. 
 [Chuckles] Boys. 
 Worry your mother to death. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Kerwin wanted me to come and see you when I got out. 
 Is that right? 
 He said, "not if but when, Daniel." 
 Had faith, did he? 
 Oh, yes, ma'am. 
 A... and once he got something in his head... 
 Oh, no, that's right. 
 He was that way even as a little old thing. 
 "First, you got to stop in at Mr. Gill's grocery store and get yourself and orange soda." 
 Kerwin loved anything orange. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Now, the color, the taste, even the word. 
 He used to call it "ernge" when he was young. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Then he'd say, "you got to go across the street to mama's house, and she's gonna squeeze the air right out of you, too." 
 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 "So get ready." 
 Oh, he wasn't lying there, Daniel. 
 Well, who hugs without squeezing? 
 Not you, mama. 
 Oh, hush, Stefan. 
 You know. 
 And he'd say it so often and with such conviction that, uh, sometimes I could actually see myself walking here right to your door. 
 And then you did, Daniel. 
 Just like my baby said. 
 B... but most of the time, I never, ever thought I'd really get out. 
 You know, I never knew anybody got off death row, you know, alive. 
 No. 
 Your mama must be so happy. 
 [Voice breaking] Hugs you whenever she wants. 
 Ah, come on, mama. Don't. Don't now. Just... 
 I know. I just can't help thinking about my baby. 
 Mama, Daniel's not like Kerwin, okay? 
 He didn't do nothing. 
 No, I guess he didn't. 
 I guess he didn't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I... I have a, um... I have a bus to catch. 
 You heading home? 
 Thank you. Uh, yes. 
 Yes, heading home. 
 Oh, please. Don't... don't rush off. 
 Mrs. Whitman? 
 Yes, Daniel. 
 Thank you for, um... well, for Kerwin. 
 He was a good person, and he was my friend. 
 I miss him every day. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hey. 
 Thanks for coming by, Daniel. 
 I wasn't sure I should. 
 Hey, good luck. 
 Thank you. 
 [Door closes] 
 Any more muffins left? 
 Um, maybe there's some in the bread basket. 
 Mm. 
 Oh, I got you. 
 You see the way old Kent scarfed down lunch today? 
 I don't think Joon spends so much time in the kitchen. 
 She makes me laugh. 
 He can be a little negative sometimes. 
 Really? In what way? 
 Come here. 
 Oh. 
 Come on. You know, want you to take a bite. 
 I... I'm not hungry. 
 Here. Take a bite. 
 I'm... 
 Take a bite. 
 You're such a good cook. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm so damn lucky. 
 Teddy, can we please... 
 Can we what? 
 Ted. 
 Oh, God. 
 Teddy. 
 Teddy! 
 By God, you... you haven't touched me in weeks, and now you got to be drunk to... 
 I don't have to be drunk. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Damn, Tawney. Will you ever be satisfied? 
 I didn't mean "stop." I just... 
 You just scare me a little bit. That's all. 
 I scare you? 
 No. No. 
 I just... 
 No, no. 
 So a convicted killer doesn't scare you, but your own husband does. 
 Don't put words in my mouth. 
 [Bottle thuds] 
 Put something else in your mouth. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 [Crying] 
 Hey, you're that guy, aren't you? 
 The... the guy that got off of death row. 
 No, I'm not him. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Look, I don't mean to bother you, Mister, uh... 
 Stacy : It's Holden, right? 
 Yeah, I'm sure of it. 
 Just wanted to say, we followed your case. 
 Real railroad job. 
 We're just tickled you're out, man. That's all. 
 Um, thank you very much. 
 I hope it's not too forward, but could... could we, like, get a picture with you? 
 O... okay, sure. 
 Oh, great. Uh, excuse me, Miss. 
 Could you take our photo? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 The guy got off of death row. Can you believe that? 
 Oh, wow. 
 Uh, sorry, Mr. Holden. 
 We got to get in kind of close. It just looks better. 
 Okay, yeah. Just frame it up a little bit. 
 There you go. Then you'll pre... 
 Right here? 
 Uh-huh. That's it. 
 Okay. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 Oh, thanks, hon. 
 Oh. Oh, it's good. 
 You want me to send it to you? 
 You on, uh, Facebook or Instagram? 
 N... no. 
 I get it. 
 Stacy : That's so crazy, right? 
 I know. Just keeps happening. 
 I know. I keep running into... no offense, but oddballs like yourself. 
 Kind of like that guy that shot himself in the head accidentally with a nail gun. 
 You remember him? 
 Not really, no. 
 Yeah, nail goes straight through the roof of this guy's mouth to the tip of his brain. 
 He doesn't even realize it until he goes to the freaking dentist. 
 I saw the news story, and then it was like two weeks later, I was... 
 I don't care. 
 W... what? 
 I don't care about your boring story. 
 You got your photo. 
 So if you don't mind, I would like to finish my dinner. 
 What an asshole. 
 Rick. 
 Look... look, I... I'm sorry. 
 No, really. 
 I'm just not used to people... 
 Look, I'm gonna delete the photo. 
 You don't have to delete the photo. 
 Are you kidding, man? 
 I... I don't want the photo. 
 Come on, Rick. 
 Dick. 
 Think they let out the wrong guy. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Oh. 
 Hi, Ms. Lovaas. 
 Wynn. Sorry. 
 Really? 
 No. 
 No, that's... great. 
 It's good to hear. 
 So is it full time or... ? 
 Oh, great. 
 Um... yeah. 
 See you Tuesday. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Hey, Ted. 
 Hey, Carl. 
 What brings you out this way? 
 Oh, uh... I need to talk to you about something. 
 Sure. 
 In confidence. 
 You got it. 
 Why don't you come in? 
 It's about Daniel. 
 Something he did... to me. 
 Come on in. 
 Hello! 
 [Grunts] 
 [Silverware clanging] 
 Coffee grounds? 
 Yeah. Coffee grounds. 
 Just regular coffee grounds? 
 Yeah, regular damn coffee grounds, Carl. 
 You know, medium-grind or whatever. 
 I buy it in bulk at Sam's. 
 Okay, Ted. 
 So, when you woke up, the grounds had already been placed back there? 
 Yeah, they'd been placed back there, all right. 
 A big old pile of them. 
 You don't remember anything before? 
 I mean, him pulling your pants down or nothing? 
 I told you, I was passed out from the choke hold he put on me. 
 You think I'd let him pull my pants down if I'd have been awake? 
 No, no. Of course not. 
 Was there, um... penetration, Ted? 
 What? 
 With the grounds? 
 Well, yeah. 
 I mean, you know, some of them trinkled down in there. 
 You know, like sand at the beach or whatever. 
 No, no. What I mean, is, um... was there penetration beyond what had trinkled there... in an intentional way? 
 Like he tried to shove them up my ass? 
 Basically. 
 No. Hell, no, Carl. 
 You know how uncomfortable this is to even talk about? 
 [Sighs] Of course. 
 I'm just trying to get the specifics, Ted. 
 It's a big difference in the eyes of the law if an object... in this case, coffee grounds... had been forced into your a**l cavity... 
 [Scoffs] Jesus, Carl. 
 ... rather than some had just matriculated into your, uh... general crack area. 
 Good God. I can't believe... 
 [sighs] Look. 
 He may have patted them down some to keep them in place, but this felt more like some kind of symbolic thing, all right? 
 Not like he was trying to shove a pound of grounds up my b-hole. 
 I mean, it's all in hindsight, Carl. 
 Really? 
 Un-goddamn-believable. 
 Look, when I woke up, I didn't know what the hell had happened, you know? 
 I was a little disoriented. 
 I'd imagine. 
 Well, it sure would've been nice if you'd told me this when it happened. 
 What do you mean? 
 Have a more solid case. 
 I'm not pressing charges, Carl. 
 Ted, you got sexual assault, maybe even attempted murder with that choke hold. 
 Who's to say he didn't want you dead? 
 He wasn't trying to kill me. 
 He was trying to teach me some kind of sick lesson. 
 If you tell anybody about this, Carl... 
 I swear to God. 
 So, you just gonna let him get away with it? 
 I'll never live this down in Paulie. 
 I'm gonna need your word on this, Carl. 
 Okay. 
 I won't tell anybody, if that's what you want. 
 It's exactly what I want. 
 But I am curious as to why you'd even tell me in the first place. 
 I can't tell dad. No. 
 Or my wife. 
 I don't know, Carl.
