 Previously on Rectify... 
 I don't think you killed George, I think it was Trey. 
 My heart breaks for you, Teddy. 
 But my heart breaks for my other son too. 
 Amantha? It's Billy. Billy Harris. 
 sh1t fire, Billy. 
 When you're always youself all the time, it feels like that you no longer exist. 
 We're here to help you. We really are. 
 Do you want me here with you? 
 I don't know if I want to be married with you. 
 I'm Daniel. I don't know many people out here. 
 Hello, Daniel. 
 Hey, Manny. 
 (SNORING LIGHTLY) 
 Hey, Manny, wake up. 
 (SNORING CONTINUES) 
 Hey, Manny. 
 Manny-Manny. 
 Manny-Manny. 
 (SNORING CONTINUES) 
 Wake up. 
 Hey, what the hell, punk? 
 It's Dan, Manny. 
 What? 
 It's Dan. You turned off your alarm and went back to sleep. 
 I did? 
 Twice. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 (KEYPAD BEEPING) 
 I-I called your name a few times, but... 
 (SIGHS) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I kind of go deep. 
 (SIGHS) 
 You're a sound sleeper. 
 sh1t you sleep through in prison, right? 
 I have a meeting I have to attend. 
 I slept through a riot once. Swear to God. 
 It was on another tier, but still, no such thing as a (CHUCKLING) quiet riot, right? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Right, well, you got to go, Dan. 
 Appreciate the tickle. 
 Are... Are y... Are you straight with the... the Metro card now? 
 Yeah, I got it. 
 You have a nice day, Manny. 
 Sure. Why not? 
 (TELEPHONES RINGING) 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) 
 Hey. 
 Come on in. 
 Have a seat. 
 You cleaned up. 
 A new leaf. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 How's Manny doing? 
 He seems to be acclimating. 
 Oh. Well, that's good. 
 How are you guys doing, you and Manny? 
 He's hard to ignore. 
 But that's probably good for me. 
 Work going okay? 
 From my perspective. 
 Why? 
 Dan, I know you've been talking to Avery some, which is good, and he hasn't gone into any details with me. 
 I just want to be clear about that. 
 Okay. 
 But we think that you should consider seeing someone more qualified to treat some of your specific issues... your PTSD. 
 And considering the years of isolation you endured, there are likely long-term effects which are frankly beyond our expertise. 
 Well, that's interesting to think about, Avery, Maggie. 
 But I-I feel that I am integrating with the men at the house more now. 
 Oh, we are not suggesting you leave the house, Dan... on the contrary. 
 We think this is exactly where you should be. 
 But we feel that additional therapy to augment what we can offer would greatly increase your chances of, you know... 
 Becoming an upstanding citizen? 
 Of having a quality of life that we all want for you. 
 Do you have any questions for us? 
 What are you talking about, exactly? 
 There's a clinical psychologist at Vanderbilt who treats individuals with PTSD. 
 Now, a lot of his patients are military veterans, but he also works with ex-offenders. 
 Just think about it, hmm? 
 No more than that right now, all right? 
 But otherwise, keep up the good work. 
 Sure. 
 (BALMORHEA'S  "BOWSPRIT"  PLAYING) 
 What do you think about the muffin? 
 It's chewy. 
 Yeah, it's got bran and stuff. 
 Sticks your ribs, all right. 
 Exactly. See, that's the problem with doughnuts. 
 You eat one of them, five minutes later, you get a sugar drop, you want another one. 
 Probably wouldn't want another one of these. 
 Yeah. 
 Anyway, uh, your car will be ready in a few. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 (CLIPBOARD CLATTERS) 
 (SIGHS) Paulie Tire. Teddy. 
 Uh, owner's not here right now. Can I help you? 
 Yes, uh, she is the owner of record, but... 
 Well, the problem is, Janet doesn't come in to the store very often, but I'm her stepson and, uh, Vice President of Sales here, so if th... 
 Sure. 
 I understand. 
 302. Yep. 
 Uh, anything else you'd like for me to pass on? 
 Okay, Bob. 
 Well, this is Ted, by the way. 
 Not sure where Carol and Alice are, but... (CHUCKLES) 
 Ah, nothing, just a... a weird film I saw once. 
 You bet. 
 I'll have her call you back. 
 (RECEIVER CLICKS) 
 Who was that? 
 Bob Childers from Kurry Morris and Associates. 
 Don't believe I know them. 
 Me, either. 
 What did he want? 
 Talk to the owner, a Mrs. Janet Matthews Holden. 
 He say about what? 
 Nope. 
 Just said he wanted to talk to her about a business matter. 
 Huh. 
 She ever change her name on the title of ownership after y'all got married? 
 Probably not. 
 (COFFEE MACHINE WHIRS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hello, Mr. Stern. 
 Sheriff. 
 Thank you, Rhetta. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (COFFEE DRIPPING) 
 You want one of these pod coffees? 
 Lots of different flavors. 
 No. I'm good. Thanks. 
 Care to sit down? 
 Been sitting all day. 
 So, what brings you back to Paulie? 
 Did you tell my client that it was George Melton's semen on Hanna Dean's panties? 
 I might have, yes. 
 And that you believe that George, Trey Willis, and someone named Chris Nelms raped Hanna? 
 (SIGHS) 
 You tell suspects many things during an investigation... 
 (MUG CLINKS) 
 Some true, some not. 
 So, Daniel was still a suspect at the time? 
 To some degree. 
 Do you have evidence to support the allegations of rape by those men? 
 Unfortunately, Mr. Stern, we're in the midst of an ongoing investigation of Mr. Melton's death. 
 I'm sure you understand. 
 No, I don't understand. 
 There are confidential elements... 
 All that I understand. 
 The legal maneuverings, the game of justice... too well, in fact. 
 What I don't understand is you, sir. 
 Even someone like Roland Foulkes, I understand. 
 I understand he doesn't care about the truth. 
 He just cares that he was right... that he is right, that he will always be right. 
 But you, Sheriff... 
 I don't know what you care about... what matters to you. 
 Being liked? 
 Respected? 
 Re-elected? 
 What's your point? 
 That  is  my point. 
 Mr. Stern, your client plead guilty to killing Hanna Dean with you right by his side, I assume giving him counsel. 
 Daniel plead guilty because I couldn't convince him to fight... because he was too afraid of going back to prison, because he didn't trust the system, me included... because George Melton hadn't turned up dead yet, because we didn't know about the rapes and the sperm and that George went to C.J. Pickens 20 years ago... 
 20 years ago... and the former good sheriff of this county... your county, sir... wouldn't even talk to him! 
 That's true, isn't it? 
 You'll have to ask C.J. about that. 
 Really? That's your answer? 
 Did you speak to the former sheriff before or after the plea deal with my client? 
 I'm done talking. 
 I think I understand you better now, Sheriff. 
 I doubt it. 
 Well, I hope you're right... or I'm wrong. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (CELLPHONE RINGING) 
 Hello? 
 (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING) 
 I got you. 
 I-I'm on break. 
 Oh, good. 
 I'm at the grocery store. 
 That's nice. 
 Mother? 
 I have to see you, Daniel. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Um... yes and no. 
 I mean, I just can't go this long without seeing you. 
 Well, I'm... I'm really doing great now, Mother. 
 You don't need to make a special trip. 
 I'm coming to Nashville... just for a day. 
 I'm not gonna... camp out or anything. 
 I just want to touch you, make sure you're real. 
 Okay. 
 But maybe we should have lunch, too. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Deal. 
 A-A-Are you sure it's okay? 
 I didn't think I had a choice in the matter. 
 Well, you don't, really. 
 Then... it's okay. 
 Okay. (CHUCKLES) 
 Good. 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 All right, I'll let you know when I'm coming. 
 Bye, now. I love you.

 How have you been feeling around Teddy lately? 
 What do you think? 
 I mean, he's... 
 He's been so lovin' and so understandin'. 
 It's not even a trick, either. 
 He's come a long way, hasn't he? 
 So have you, Tawney. 
 If you say so. 
 It's a process... a lifelong one. 
 Mm, I still catch myself trying to figure out who people want me to be... rather than... being who I am. 
 But you're aware of it now, right? 
 When we first got together... 
 I used to like it when Teddy just kind of... took me over. 
 I felt... I don't know. 
 Absorbed. 
 Safe. 
 I-I mean, it... it felt safe at first. 
 And then I... then I stopped liking it so much. 
 Not liking it so much? 
 Resenting it... being annoyed by it... and hating it. 
 And why is that? 
 Because I want to be my own person, Rebecca. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Careful what you wish for. 
 Do you think I should just do it? 
 Do what? 
 Leave. 
 Just leave. 
 D-i-v-o-r-c-e? 
 I don't know. 
 What do  you  think? 
 I think it's unfair to Teddy to keep treading water like this. 
 It's been his choice, too, Tawney. 
 Okay. 
 What I really think... is it's... it's very, very sad (VOICE BREAKING) and scary. 
 And I'm... I'm not sure I can... 
 Can what? 
 I mean, Teddy's been my... my family... my only family, really. 
 For better or worse, he's been there. 
 Mm. It would... 
 It would feel like a... like a death, in a way. 
 It might feel like that, but it wouldn't be, Tawney. 
 You would still exist. 
 I promise. 
 (CRIES) 
 Janet : This is quite the surprise. 
 (BAG ZIPPING) 
 Of course we would. When? 
 This Wednesday? 
 That sounds fine, Bob. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 1:00 p.m. works. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 See you then. 
 (TELEPHONE BEEPS) 
 He wants to buy the store. 
 Huh. 
 It's like what you said... how many things could it be? 
 And that's what it was. 
 Did he say how much or why? 
 He actually said he was representing someone and he wanted to come down and make a formal offer for the property on their behalf. 
 So, it's not a definite offer? 
 He implied it would be. 
 Did he say the store or the property? 
 I think he said the property, but the store is on the property. 
 What difference does it make? 
 It could be somebody who just wants the property. 
 And do what? Tear down the building? 
 I don't know. 
 He didn't sound regional. 
 Probably you should let Teddy know. 
 I'm sure he's on pins and needles. 
 Teddy should be there at the meeting, don't you think? 
 (OVEN DOOR CLOSES) 
 Couldn't hurt to have another set of ears. 
 Maybe  all  the kids should be there. 
 I don't know. 
 We don't even have an offer yet. 
 Might not be worth riling everybody up. 
 Y-You know what? 
 I-I need time to think about this. 
 Don't tell Teddy yet. 
 Don't tell him that you talked to the guy? 
 You can tell him  that. 
 I mean, just not about the specific details of the what and why. 
 Okay. 
 I'm not saying I don't want Teddy there. 
 I just... 
 This is just so out of the blue, Ted. 
 I need time to process. 
 Sure, Janet. 
 And I don't want you to worry. 
 I'm not gonna sell the store unless everybody agrees that's the thing to do. 
 I'm not worried. 
 I just think you should hear the offer, if there is an offer, and we'll go from there. 
 Sounds like a plan. 
 Well, I-I go there sometimes a-after work a-and just hang out. 
 But tonight, they're... they're having a special event, so I-I-I'm gonna go. 
 (LIGHT LAUGHTER) 
 Man : Go. 
 You made you any art yet, Dan? 
 I don't know if I'll actually make anything. 
 I just like to watch, like Chauncey the gardener. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Sounds like it's good for you, this co-op art place. 
 Never could quite see you hanging out with the racecar crowd. 
 (LIGHT LAUGHTER) 
 Looks like you found some people that you can get down with. 
 (LIGHT LAUGHTER) 
 I-I hope so. 
 "Being There." 
 The, um, "Pink Panther" dude. 
 Yeah. "Being There." 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Man : What? 
 (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) 
 Are there gonna be any girls at this arty-farty thing? 
 They're generally part of the equation. 
 (LIGHT LAUGHTER) 
 
 
 
 Maybe old Manny should tag along, you know? 
 Moral support. (CHUCKLES) 
 Uh, I-I don't know, Manny. 
 Probably ought to let Dan have this one for himself. 
 What are you, his daddy now? 
 What? 
 Whoa, whoa. What's going on here, Manny? 
 Nothing, boss man. 
 Now, first, I ain't your boss man, and second... what's going on? 
 You know. 
 Did over a nickel in prison, so want to have a little fun every once in a while. 
 That's all. 
 When was the last time you had fun that didn't equal trouble? 
 On the outside? 
 Ain't been on the outside. 
 You ain't been out two good weeks yet, Manny. You think it's good judgment to show up at somebody else's party uninvited? 
 Didn't know it was invite-only. 
 Mm. 
 Avery : Two things, fellas... check your motives and please share any ideas or impulses with me or somebody else in the group. 
 Don't keep your own counsel. 
 And I don't need to tell you why. 
 (KEYBOARD CLACKING) 
 (PEN SCRATCHING) 
 (CELLPHONE RINGING) 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Well, (SIGHS) she called the guy... Bob. 
 He say what it was about? 
 He didn't go into details, but, uh, it seems he wants to talk further about things. 
 That's mysterious. 
 (BOTTLE CAP CLATTERS) 
 Anyway, just wanted to let you know. 
 Well, Kurry Morris and Associates is a firm that searches for properties for large retail corporations to purchase. 
 Is that right? 
 I mean, if old Bob's as vague as you say, this might be useful information for you and Janet. 
 Well, he did mention perhaps they were interested in making an offer or at least were considering our property for, um, purchase. 
 Who's "they"? 
 I didn't talk to him, Teddy. 
 He just... 
 Just what? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, I think he might want a meetin'. 
 Here? 
 Believe so. 
 He say when? 
 Uh... well, he was talking about Wednesday. 
 W-Were y'all even gonna tell me about the meeting? 
 Of course. 
 Look, son, this has got Janet all twisted. 
 She just wanted some time to... to figure on things without telling all the kids yet. 
 "All the kids"? 
 I know what this sounds like, but I'm in a tough position here, Teddy. 
 It's... (KNOCK ON DOOR) kind of your bed, ain't it, Dad? 
 I got to go. Somebody's knocking. 
 (CELLPHONE BEEPS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hi. 
 I'm, uh, Melvin, the apartment manager. 
 Oh, right. Come on in, buddy. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 You got a visitor. 
 Thank you, Peanut. 
 Hey. 
 Been meaning to come by here. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Needed some paper products, too, so... 
 Oh. Well, we have a wide assortment. 
 That's not really true. We have a  cheap  assortment. 
 You want to go get a beer sometime? 
 A beer? 
 Well... 
 I didn't mean to put you on the spot. 
 Just, after seeing you the other night, I thought... might be fun or something. 
 Where? 
 County Line? 
 Country Club? 
 My tailgate? 
 The usual suspects? 
 Same old Paulie. 
 (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
 Well, uh, um... 
 Probably a bad idea. 
 I always try and keep a few of those handy. 
 Why not? 
 I could, uh, use a beer, frankly, before going back to Mother's. 
 Tonight? 
 Sure. 
 Okay, sure. Why not? 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Um... (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Um... 
 Well, we're getting ready to close up. 
 You mind hanging out for a few? 
 Be here hanging. 
 Okay. 
 (RINGING) 
 At the tone, please record your message. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (BEEP) 
 Hey, Janet, uh, it's John Stern. 
 Um... I'm... I just wanted you and the family to know that I'm back in town. 
 Uh, nothing to worry about, really, just tying up a few loose ends. 
 Um, anyway, um, I'll try and stop by the house... before I head back north. 
 It would be lovely to see you all. 
 Okay, then. (CLEARS THROAT) Bye-bye. 
 (CELLPHONE BEEPS) 
 Okay, what else? 
 Um... laundry-room key, uh, pool hours. 
 That's about it, really, um... 
 Oh, don't... don't grill after 10:00. 
 Got it. 
 Well...(SIGHS) 
 You wouldn't happen to have another beer? 
 Sure. 
 I'm off hours. 
 Great. 
 (BOTTLE CLINKING) 
 How's he doing? 
 Who? 
 Daniel. 
 Oh, right, right. Uh, well... he's adjusting. 
 And he's got a full-time job. 
 Now, that's wonderful. 
 Uh, doing what? 
 Uh, well... 
 Janet's been talkin' to him mostly, Melvin, so... 
 I gave him his first job. 
 Oh, really? 
 Right after he got out of that... hellhole. 
 Painting our pool. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Well, good for you. 
 It  was  good for me. 
 He  was good for me. 
 I miss him. 
 (SIGHS) 
 And now, with all this... sh1t that's come out... 
 It's a lot. 
 It just breaks your heart, doesn't it? 
 I don't know why it's hitting me so hard tonight. 
 I... I mean, it's nothing compared to what y'all must be going through. 
 I don't... I don't mean to imply that, Ted. 
 Oh, no. 
 Everybody has their own experience, Melvin. 
 Cecilia Abbott. 
 Wait. 
 Lives in Birmingham, five kids, sells... something. 
 Close. 
 Lives in Macon, has three kids, second husband, sells Mary Kay. 
 Yes! 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Who do you think is the richest? 
 In our class? 
 (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) 
 You miss curfew? 
 You're funny. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (SIGHS) 
 You need to take that? I'll step outside. 
 No. I don't need to take this. 
 Where were we? 
 Dustin Hunt. 
 The richest? 
 Bullshit. 
 Got into finance after college. 
 Well... good for old Dustin. 
 Yep. Good for him. 
 Is it like a lot, lot? 
 Jenny Paar said he leases a jet. 
 That's just wrong. 
 Like a baby Lear or something. 
 Jenny was my best friend in seventh grade. 
 Yeah, I remember y'all were tight. 
 She talk sh1t about me like we're talking sh1t about Dustin? 
 Not that I know of. 
 I won't say your name never comes up in conversation, but everybody's name comes up at some point or another. 
 Like my brother's. 
 Sometimes... especially lately. 
 But I try and stay out of all that. 
 Stay out of all that what? 
 Speculation, I guess. 
 You have another one of them cheap-ass beers? 
 When you put it like that... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (RINGING) 
 Hi. This is Tawney. Please leave a message. 
 (BEEP) 
 Hey. 
 I know you're working. 
 You don't have to call me back. 
 I'm about to turn in myself. 
 Just, uh... had a really interesting day. 
 And, uh... 
 Well, I can tell you about it on, uh, on date night. 
 Until then, old Teddy signing out. 
 Uh, I love you. 
 I'm just saying that so you know you're loved and, you know, in case you think you're not sometimes. 
 I hope this didn't freak you out. 
 Old Teddy. 
 (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING, INDISTINCT SINGING) 
 You look uncomfortable. 
 Um, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to. 
 No. That's a compliment. 
 Oh. 
 Nobody likes this, either team. 
 It's just what our side has to do to keep the lights on. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 Sorry if my, uh... my cynicism is raining on your experience. 
 Really. I think it's hormone-related. 
 I'm not, uh, unfamiliar with the cynic stance. 
 I bet. 
 Anyway, I think cynicism gets a bad rap... from people who are afraid of it. 
 Like optimists? 
 (CHUCKLES) Especially that tribe of un-heathens. 
 So, what are you afraid of, Chloe, if not optimism? 
 Boredom. 
 Why do you think that is? 
 Because it's a sign that I have to... do something or change something. 
 What happens if you don't? 
 I become mean until others change something... usually their zip code. 
 Is that a warning? 
 I don't know you well enough yet. 
 I try to stay in a... constant state of boredom. 
 Well,  that  can't be good. 
 Probably not a long-term solution. 
 But for now, it's a balm of a sort. 
 You couldn't have been bored when you first got out. 
 No. (CHUCKLES) 
 Not bored. 
 Wasn't even sure I was alive. 
 Well, I'm not certain we are now. 
 I Googled you. 
 It's just what people do now, especially when they meet somebody who's, you know... 
 No, I-I-I don't know. Who's what? 
 Google-able. 
 And am I that? 
 Yeah. You are that. 
 So, what do you find when you... 
 Google Daniel Holden? 
 Anything you want to find. 
 It's the Internet. 
 Do you want to see my apartment? 
 I have to get off my feet. 
 Or not. 
 Sure. 
 (VEHICLE APPROACHES)

 (KEYS JANGLE) 
 I hope you weren't waiting up for  me. 
 Your father never really liked the tire business. 
 Okay. 
 I mean, it wasn't in his blood or anything like that. 
 But why would anyone have tires in their blood... stinky tires, for God's sake? 
 It was just a business he could support his family with. 
 Your dad was in the family business. 
 What brought all of this on? 
 I didn't want you to come back here to be my de facto psychiatrist. 
 I really didn't, Amantha. 
 I don't want to do that to you, not anymore. 
 I came here wide-eyed and of my own free will, Mother... mostly. 
 How was your date with Billy? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Showing up at my work is... hard to qualify as a date, but, uh, it was... nice. 
 He still do yards? 
 He's still in that line of work, Mother, but I believe he prefers the title of "landscaper." 
 Mm. 
 You think you'll see him again? 
 Uh, yes, in fact, I do. 
 We're going huntin' this weekend. 
 Hunting? Hunting what? 
 Foul. 
 Have you been drinking? 
 Not as much as you. 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 Your friend Jon called. 
 Yeah, he called me, too. 
 But, uh, I haven't listened to the message yet. 
 What does my friend have on his mind? 
 He's in town. 
 What? 
 Poking around. 
 Why? 
 Guilt, probably. 
 Well, if that's the reason, then he should see the psychiatrist that you're not seeing. 
 I'm going to bed. 
 Somebody wants to buy the store. 
 What? 
 Isn't that just strange? 
 What are you talking about? 
 (SIGHS) 
 I'm not supposed to tell you yet. 
 Why not? 
 Because I asked Ted not to tell Teddy yet. 
 And why not? 
 (SIGHS) 
 So that I could sit here and sip my wine and ruminate on the tire business and all the business that goes with the business of the tire business. 
 Okay, well, I won't say anything until whoever knows or needs to know knows. 
 It was never really fair to Ted. 
 What wasn't? 
 All of this, all this sh1t... all this sh1t he just walked into. 
 I grabbed him like he was a life preserver, you know? 
 Think I might have pulled him under. 
 Do you have any more wine? 
 Yes, please. 
 Did you paint this? 
 I wish. 
 I make trinkets. 
 But I do think that I have an eye. 
 An eye for what? 
 That which is provocative. 
 (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING, INDISTINCT SINGING) 
 What's your deal? 
 What do you mean? 
 Regarding me. 
 I didn't know that I had to have a deal. 
 Do  you  have a deal regarding  me? 
 Probably. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I don't collect wounded animals, if that's what you mean. 
 You like being around danger? 
 Are you dangerous? 
 Sometimes. 
 Mostly to myself, rarely others. 
 That's useful information. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Look, I don't have myself completely figured out yet, so I... I can't ascribe a clear motive to my every action and desire. 
 But I can say that I'm not looking for a longtime companion... or a s*x partner, for that matter. 
 So, you're looking for a platonic fling. 
 With a straight man, preferably. 
 That's an odd proposition. 
 Okay, I do kind of have a deal. 
 And what's that? 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Don't worry. 
 You're not the father. (SCOFFS) 
 Do you know who is? 
 Rude. 
 Of course I know who the father is. 
 And where might he be? 
 I ran him off. 
 Trust me. He was not up for the task. 
 So, this is like a... job interview. 
 Don't flatter yourself. 
 I already told you... I'm not looking for no man. 
 If  I decide to have this thing, I'm gonna go to my sister's, birth it with her. 
 And what then? 
 I will raise it like my own or give it away, sell it on the black market. 
 I thought you hadn't decided whether you were gonna have it or not. 
 I can't not have it. 
 Why not? 
 You know what? You should run away, too. 
 You can come back to the co-op anytime you want, and I will not glom on to you again. 
 Prometto. 
 Is that what you're doing... glomming? 
 I have no idea what I'm doing. 
 I gave up pot and I gave up booze and I gave up dairy. 
 I've given up pretty much everything except for hormones, so I have no idea at this time as to what it is that I am doing. 
 Hey. 
 We could start a club. 
 I think mine's temporary. 
 Is yours? 
 I doubt it. 
 Are you really pregnant? 
 Geez Louise. 
 Okay, this is gonna be a little fresh, but I think it's gonna help you in the big picture. 
 Come here. 
 Closer, danger man. 
 Just remember that we're all professionals here. 
 You feel that? 
 Yes. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 That's my little baby. 
 You still bored? 
 No. 
 That's so nice... calming. 
 Thank you.
