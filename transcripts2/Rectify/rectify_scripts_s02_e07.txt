 Previously on "Rectify"... 
 You're pregnant. 
 So, you'd let him plea out of it... 
 Give me another option, Roland, one that saves both of us. 
 Daniel Holden. As free as the wind blows. 
 Feels real, don't it? 
 Let me talk to you about some... 
 It's about Daniel. Something he did... to me. 
 For later on. 
 Are they shrooms? 
 You already know what to do, Daniel. Just got to remember it. 
 Daniel. 
 Daniel. 
 Woman : I remember when I was a little girl, my dada took me to the circus... the greatest show on earth. 
 There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears... 
 And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads. 
 And as I sat there watching, I had the feeling that something was missing. 
 I don't know what, but when it was all over, I said to myself, "Is that all there is to the circus?" 
 Uh-oh. Here comes trouble. 
 ♪ I know what you must be saying to yourselves ♪ 
♪ "if that's the way she feels about it ♪ 
♪ Why doesn't she just end it all?" ♪ 
♪ Oh, no ♪ 
 Cat's got his tongue. 
 Woman : I'm not ready yet for that final disappointment. 
 For I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you, when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath... I'll be saying to myself, "Is that all? Is that all there is to dying?"

Weird As You 
 [Garage door whirring] 
 [Whirring stops] 
 [Water running] 
 Ted Jr.  : Baby, you're not still mad at me, are you? 
 Are you? 
 No, it's okay. 
 Really, it's fine. 
 I just couldn't not tell them. You know? 
 [Exhales] 
 I know. 
 I mean, I just get so excited. 
 Am excited. Happy. 
 [Growls, smooches] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm glad, Teddy. Me too. 
 Yeah? 
 Of course I am. 
 Getting excited a little bit. 
 [Smooches] I mean, God's will, right? 
 Yes. 
 I love you, Tawney. 
 I know you do. 
 I love you, too. 
 Do you? 
 I do love you, Teddy. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Jesus. 
 How'd you even know where I lived? 
 White pages. 
 [Scoffs] Oh, yeah. 
 Those. 
 It's amazing what survives and what doesn't, isn't it? 
 It is. 
 Well, sh1t. 
 What can I do for you, Daniel? 
 I'm not sure why... today exactly, but, uh... 
 I wanted to come and see you. 
 Is that right? 
 To say "No hard feelings." 
 All right. 
 Sure, buddy. 
 Thanks. 
 You huff it all the way over here? 
 It's not that far. 
 Not that close, either. 
 Got anyplace else you're supposed to be? 
 Then get your ass on inside. 
 Did they give you grape soda? 
 Who? 
 The police. 
 That night. 
 "That night"? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Well, damn, Daniel, you just jumping right in, huh? 
 I'm not even sure, man. 
 I don't think on it too much anymore. 
 Okay. 
 You thirsty? 
 [Refrigerator door closes] 
 My wife got these for a church thing she had over here. 
 They've been clogging up the fridge. 
 I figure, hey, it's Monday morning. Might as well have an adult lemonade. 
 We played tecmo bowl on this. 
 You're damn right we did. 
 Yeah. 
 My parents gave it to us when we got married. 
 It anchors the room. 
 So, uh... 
 What was it like in there, man? 
 I mean, I got to ask. Right? 
 Confining. 
 Mm. 
 That would be the word for it, I suppose. 
 Confining in some ways, but... 
 Do you still talk to George? 
 Damn, that's a sequitur. 
 George? 
 George. 
 I haven't seen old George in... 
 Well, we went fishing together a couple years ago on the Flint. 
 Funny you mention him, though. 
 Thought I might give him a call. 
 Thought you'd give him a call or you gave him a call? 
 Easy there, counselor. 
 Don't go poking me in the chest with no question marks. 
 I gave him a call. 
 To be nice. 
 Hadn't heard back. 
 Where's he live now? 
 Oh, these are terrible. You want a beer? 
 Uh... 
 Georgey lives in Florida. 
 Live Oak. 
 Satan's butthole, man. 
 You ain't thinking about hurting him, are you? 
 I don't want to hurt anybody. 
 'Cause I wouldn't want to be a part of anything like that. 
 Part of what? 
 But if you go visit him, tell him I said "hello." 
 [Sighs] 
 I will. 
 Go visit him or tell him I said "hello"? 
 Both, I suppose. 
 I'm not sure. 
 I should go. 
 Hey. Hey, that's, uh... [Chuckles] 
 That's a long ride down to Live Oak, buddy. 
 I'll figure it out. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 Hey. 
 I'm supposed to be at a job this morning, but he's a cheap son of a bitch, really. 
 What say... we go on a road trip? 
 Should we call him first? 
 Look, that night... or that morning, I mean, with the police... all I did was say you and her were arguing. 
 That's it. It was George who said... hell. 
 You want to go down there, you want to talk with him about it, as long as you keep it gentlemanly... 
 [Tab pops] 
 I am happy to do the driving. 
 All right. Put your little bicycle in the bed there, and you grab shotgun. I'm gonna piss real quick. 
 And then we'll hit the road, son! 
 [Truck door opens, closes] 
 [Latches click] 
 [Sighs] 
 Tray tables up, passengers. 
 Prepare for takeoff. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 [Scanner beeping] 
 Oh. 
 I-I got one for that. 
 Figured you might. 
 [Scanner beeps] 
 Your total is $41.20. 
 One... 
 Two... 
 Three... 
 Four... 
 Five... 
 Six... 
 Seven... 
 Eight $1s. 
 Oh, there's that $10. 
 Yep. There it is. 
 And...$20. 
 That's... $38. 
 $38? 
 So I'm... 
 $3.20 short. 
 $3.20...? 
 Short. 
 [Huffs] 
 I hate to use these, but... 
 I don't even know if that... 
 [sighs] 
 Uh... 
 You still owe 20 cents. 
 I know I have a quarter in here. 
 [Inhales] 
 It's a Virginia one. Got Jamestown on it. 
 Forget it. God. Forget it. 
 I will pay the 20 cents. Not a problem, okay? 
 [Keyboard clacks] 
 [Chuckles lightly] 
 What do you know? 
 Jamestown. 
 [Keyboard clacks] 
 Trey : That's right... right there. 
 [Tab pops] 
 Appreciate you flipping the bill for those. 
 Tastes good. 
 Yeah, as good as it gets. 
 Oh, man. Unreal. 
 I mean, damn! What? 
 You son of a bitch! 
 When I got out of bed this morning and I was staring out that little window above our commode at the traffic light that's out on 39 that is always green out beyond the hayfield, I never would have said, "well, today's the day that I'm gonna go to Florida with Daniel G.D. Holden." 
 I mean, never. 
 The light's always green? 
 I ain't never seen it red. 
 Not once. 
 Why's it there? 
 Hmm. 
 Some things, you just don't see coming. 
 I think you're right. 
 I am right. 
 But I'm glad to be sitting here with you. 
 Feels right. 
 Feels like we're.. going somewhere. 
 Everything that is good between men and women was written in mud. 
 And butter. 
 And barbecue sauce. 
 You know? 
 No. 
 [Laughs] 
 Paula Deen said that to me in a dream I had one time. 
 Who's Paula Deen? 
 Oh, she's a chef on TV. 
 Well, she was. 
 Chefs are on TV now, for some reason. 
 Mm. 
 People eat it up. 
 Anyway, she's just a big ol' ham hock out of Albany, G.A. 
 She makes Southern food for Yankees. 
 My point is, in my dream, I'm white-water rafting with her, for some reason, and, um, she said that to me... 
 Right before she... touched my hamster. 
 [Laughing] But it stuck with me, you know? 
 It's the only thing from a dream that ever has. 
 Do you dream often? 
 No. Almost never. 
 I think I sleep more soundly than anybody I ever met. 
 In fact, I know I do. 
 Now, you seem the type that does a lot of dreaming. 
 Well, sometimes. 
 You wake up and think about them? 
 Seems like a waste of time to me. 
 A waste to think on them? 
 Once you're awake and walking around in the real world, yeah. 
 I mean, once there are things to actually take care of. 
 I don't know. 
 Trying to find meaning in them... trying to find meaning in anything. 
 It's a waste of time, if you really want to get down to it. 
 So life's meaningless? 
 Whose life? 
 Anybody's life, I suppose. 
 Isn't that what you're saying? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Damn, man, you twist things around like a woman. 
 Wynn was mad. 
 Wasn't she? 
 She all corporate, you know? 
 She'll be all right. 
 Yeah, but I don't like being like that. 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's been too long since I smoked. 
 Exactly... too long. 
 No, too long to do it again. 
 That'd put me on my ass. 
 That such a bad thing... out your head and on your ass? 
 [Sighs] 
 Can't believe this. 
 32 years old. 
 Smoking weed in the Thrifty Town parking lot where I actually friggin' work. 
 [Laughs] 
 How did this happen? 
 [Coughing] 
 Mm-hmm. 
 There it is. 
 [Both laughing] 
 Mm. 
 Just follow the shiny metal things. 
 [Laughs] 
 After you, my lady. 
 I've never bought tires before. 
 They've always just.. been there. 
 [Sighs, chuckles lightly] 
 The register used to be right here. 
 Mm. 
 Dad would keep one of those big-ass metal flashlights right here, just in case he'd need to take a swing at anyone. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 [Both laugh] 
 Check in with me next week. I should have that in for you. 
 Thank you for shopping at Paulie Tire. 
 I hope you come back again. 
 Bye. [Chuckles] 
 Amantha? 
 Hey. 
 What are... what are y'all up to today? 
 Hey, Teddy. Hope we're not bothering you. 
 Well, I can't imagine you're here for tires. 
 Hey! 
 Congratulations again about the baby. 
 Oh. 
 Seriously. 
 Thank you. Yeah. [Gasps] 
 This is Alesha. 
 And this is the tire store. 
 [Both laughing] 
 I'm the stepbrother. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 We'll get out of your hair in just a second. 
 I just wanted to show her around. 
 I haven't been here in so long. 
 It smells the same. 
 [Chuckles lightly] 
 It's a good smell. 
 I think about that a lot. 
 Always smells the dang same. 
 Hmm. 
 I told Alesha that we have the vending machine to beat all vending machines. 
 That's true. 
 We have the chocolate- and-peanut-butter twix, so... 
 She'd like the keys. 
 Oh. Yeah. All right. 
 It's like Wonka's factory, but with rims. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Thank you, Teddy. 
 No problem. 
 [Chuckling] Okay. 
 [Mutters] 
 [Both laugh] 
 [Shouts indistinctly] 
 [Laughs] 
 What would you like? 
 Number 4, please. 
 Ahhh! [Laughs] 
 Here you go. 
 Okay, okay. 
 I would like that one, too. 
 
 
 
 Good afternoon, Mr. Stern. 
 Good afternoon. 
 I am on a panel in half an hour. 
 Need to do a little cramming. 
 I'm sorry... I don't have much time to help you prep. 
 I'm supposed to be on a plane in a couple of hours. 
 This is nothing official yet, but I asked you to meet me here today because I am now willing... begrudgingly, but willing... to discuss the possibility of a plea deal for Daniel Holden. 
 I'm all ears. 
 Time served plus 10, 15 more probation. 
 He's not doing more time. 
 One way or another, he's going back inside, Jon. 
 Only thing left to discuss is how long. 
 10 years is not a discussion. 
 How about life? 
 If you really wanted to go to trial, you wouldn't be offering... 
 I'm not scared to go back to trial. 
 That DNA's out there now. Gonna be hard to answer for that... multiple samples. 
 And he confessed... on the record. 
 And it's gonna be hard to argue that it was coerced above the sound of the tape rolling... the sound of him saying that he did it. 
 What if we get that confession thrown out? 
 If you think I see zero chance of getting another conviction at trial, I'm here to dissuade you of that notion. 
 You and your client should be terrified of stepping foot in a courtroom. 
 I'm throwing you a lifeline here. 
 Time plus 10. 
 Now you say "thank you," you go tell your client, and you don't make this difficult. 
 I'll talk with my client. 
 You do that... quickly and quietly. This isn't gonna be drawn out. 
 Sorry to make you miss a flight. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Horn honks] 
 Trey : His truck's here. 
 [Truck door opens, closes] 
 Hey, grab them beers. 
 [Knock on door] [Laughs] 
 Damn. 
 Boy's got a lot of nerve... not being home after we drove all this way just to have a beer with him. 
 Should have called, I guess. 
 I'm gonna go check the back. 
 [Groans] 
 [Sighs] 
 Back door is open! 
 [Door opens] 
 Come on in. 
 Is he here? 
 Doesn't look like it. 
 Should we... 
 Wait out here in the sun? No. 
 Screw that, buddy. Come on. 
 Did you check in the back? 
 I didn't even think to. 
 Hey, George! 
 [Heavy-metal music playing loudly] 
 [Rattling] 
 [Laughs] 
 Courtesy of Melton Pharmaceuticals! 
 George won't mind! It's like old times! 
 [Door creaks] 
 Um... 
 What are you doing? 
 Um... 
 Drinking a beer, making spaghetti. 
 Did you miss your flight? 
 Come kiss me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What's going on? 
 Come here. [Chuckles] 
 What? 
 Are you high? 
 Maybe. 
 [Laughs] 
 Amantha Holden, you rule breaker. 
 Mm. Just don't tell Daggett. 
 Oh, I won't. 
 No, but, seriously... what's up? 
 I can't tell you. 
 You can't say you can't tell me. 
 I shouldn't tell you. 
 Not yet. 
 What is it Jon? 
 They want to arrest him again. 
 Amantha. 
 Oh, my God. They're gonna put him back on trial. 
 I knew... 
 No. 
 What do you mean "no"? 
 What? 
 They want to offer him a plea deal. 
 A plea deal? 
 A plea deal? 
 What do they want? 
 Well, they want him to... plead guilty, obviously. 
 And? 
 And... 
 [Clears throat] 
 10 more years. 
 No. No! "F" that, Jon! 
 It can all be negotiated. That's just where they started. 
 [Sighs] 
 Wait. 
 They're offering a way out. 
 Of sorts, yeah. 
 They don't think they can win. 
 W-why else would they be talking like this? 
 You know it's not that simple. 
 Daniel's gonna think they're folding, too. Call him. 
 I have been. 
 And he's not calling me back. 
 God, what a buzzkill. 
 Yep. 
 Senator. Carl. 
 This is a surprise. 
 How you doing, Ted? 
 I don't know yet. 
 Teddy, I want you to know that I absolutely felt like I had to. 
 Christ, Carl. 
 Why? 
 It's just us now, Teddy. 
 "Just us," what? 
 God damn it, Carl. 
 He didn't want to betray your confidence, son, but it was the right thing to do. 
 It wasn't easy, but it was right. 
 Right for who? 
 We want you to come forward. 
 We need you to press charges. 
 There's no way I'd do that. 
 No way in hell. 
 You need to think about the next person that Daniel has a problem with. 
 You think this was a two-time thing? 
 What he did to Hanna? 
 What he did to you? 
 That he's gonna stop, like he's cured or something? 
 He has these compulsions, Ted. It's as if he can't help himself. 
 Look... we got in an argument that night. 
 Things got out of hand. 
 That's all. 
 What about your stepmama? 
 Your daddy, your... your little brother? 
 They're all living under the same roof with him, aren't they? 
 He'd never hurt mom. 
 And what about your wife? 
 This little argument was about her, initially. 
 You don't want to put her in any future danger, do you? 
 That son of a bitch is never gonna be alone with her again. 
 I can promise you that. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Sighs] 
 This would rip my family apart. 
 Rip them apart. 
 My mom... 
 My dad... 
 Everybody. 
 It'd be over. 
 I feel for you, son. 
 I do. 
 But this is bigger than you... bigger than your family, even. 
 In a way, it's... it's out of your hands. 
 O-out of all of our hands. 
 I made it up. 
 I mean, uh... 
 We got into an argument that night. That... That part's true. 
 But the rest of it, I just... made up. 
 Why would you make something like that up, son? 
 I don't know. 
 'Cause I was drunk, I guess. 
 I made a mistake. 
 Now, if you'll all excuse me, I got to close the shop up. 
 This ain't going away, Ted. 
 The truth never does. 
 That is the truth. 
 Now, if you'll all excuse me... 
 [Lock clicks] 
 You think we ought to work our way up the Talbot family tree? 
 Ted Sr.? 
 I don't know about that, Roland. 
 You don't have to. 
 [Car door opens] 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Rock music plays] 
 I had an Uncle who went bat-shit... just lost it. 
 A cousin, I guess it was... is. 
 How'd he lose it? 
 He's my dad's second cousin. 
 He's old now. 
 So, he's your second cousin, too. 
 What? 
 Your dad's second cousin is your second cousin, only once removed. 
 Yeah. 
 Anyway, he just lost it one day, man. 
 That can happen. 
 He was, uh, artsy... real artsy for a while. 
 You know, however artsy you can be in Spartanburg. 
 He was always, um, putting on plays and... lots of spanish stuff. 
 Lorca? 
 Sure. Doesn't matter. 
 Lorca was shot on the side of the road a month into the Spanish civil war. 
 Well, my dad's cousin stabbed a librarian in the face three days into 1981. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where's them mints at? 
 Behind the at. 
 [Mint tin slams] All right. Okay. 
 Little... little egg-shaped blue one. 
 Take you one. 
 [Sighs] 
 Them yellows never took. 
 ♪ 
 Shake the cobwebs off. 
 What time is it? 
 You don't have to do time no more. 
 I'm gonna... I'm gonna call... 
 Who you got to call? [Chuckles] 
 Your mama? 
 You do! [Laughing] You do! 
 [Chuckling] You got to call your mama! 
 You're... you're like a time machine that don't go nowhere... but backwards! 
 [Music continues] 
 Hey, you want me to turn down the jams? 
 So she's not worried about you [music stops] Being around a bad element? 
 Tell her you are the bad element. 
 I was just a kid back then. 
 I never understood why he did it... my second cousin. 
 Once removed. 
 I remember my family being horrified. 
 Didn't understand that either. 
 Be honest. 
 I wasn't horrified. 
 I was like, "wow. 
 Wish I'd seen them plays." 
 Hey! 
 Mama happy now? 
 Mm? Mm... 
 [Gulps] 
 [Both groan] 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 [Sighs] 
 She was a bitch, man. 
 Who? 
 Hanna. 
 Bitch and a slut. 
 Oh, don't say that. 
 Ain't that why we're here? 
 To fill in the blanks? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 You swear on a stack of bibles you don't remember? 
 Remember what? 
 What the hell happened. 
 No. 
 You don't remember raping her, like your buddy George testified? 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't remember raping her, no. 
 That's because you didn't rape her, Daniel. 
 You didn't even screw her, bud. 
 You couldn't get it up, man. 
 Or did you block out that part, too? 
 How would you know that? 
 She told me... after you ran off all weirded out. 
 Why would she tell you that? 
 I popped Hanna's cherry when she was 13. 
 Well, her Uncle did before, but outside of family, I mean... 
 You're lying. 
 I knew her way better than you did, Daniel. 
 I never understood why you thought she was so damn special. 
 She was special. 
 Okay, buddy. She was special. 
 But you, uh, do remember not being able to get it up now, don't you? 
 I don't... 
 Know. 
 We were up there watching the whole thing... you yelling at her 'cause you were embarrassed and her laughing. I mean, she wasn't laughing at you. 
 She was just laughing. She was tripping. 
 Everything was funny to her, especially you all dick-puny mad. 
 I thought she told you what happened, not you saw what happened. 
 She did tell me. 
 See, we came down to her after you left... her still naked as a jaybird on that blanket. 
 That girl never did like clothes. 
 Oh, man. 
 You know, you just can't realize how pretty a 16-year-old girl is when you're that age. 
 [Laughing] I just wish I had me a backwards-only time machine. 
 Don't talk anymore. 
 Okay. 
 Sure, buddy. 
 Want to just wait around and listen to music and wait for George? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 George ain't coming. 
 Betcha $5 you're right. 
 Did you kill her, Trey? 
 Come on, man. 
 You really think I'd incriminate myself? 
 You might be wired or something. 
 I had no motive, Daniel. She didn't mean... anything to me. 
 Besides that, I could have gotten it anytime I wanted. 
 So what would have been the point? 
 You can't tell anybody this. 
 Swear? 
 Sure. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 I let old melton suck me off a couple times back then, when there were no girls around. 
 He was a weird one, too... weird as you. 
 "Was"? 
 Yeah. 
 "Was." 
 Maybe he's had therapy or something. I don't know. 
 But, hell, George could have killed her. 
 He had pt-up issues, man. 
 He shot a cat with a .410. 
 You're full of sh1t. 
 [Chuckles lightly] 
 No, it had to be you. 
 Nothing else is logical. 
 You tell me why I don't remember doing it, Trey, if you have all the answers. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Well, that ain't the question that's bugging me. 
 My question is, why would you say that you did it if you didn't or if you didn't remember? 
 They made me believe that I had... 
 For a while. 
 Made you believe or made you remember? 
 You know what? I believe you. 
 I actually believe you. 
 Believe what? 
 That you don't remember. 
 But I sure as hell don't believe you didn't do it. 
 [Sighs] 
 I saw you up there watching us. 
 I wasn't up there. 
 Aw, sure you were. 
 With her grabbing everything put in her face... just grabbing it and touching it and kissing it and sucking it like it wasn't even real. 
 Shut up, Trey! 
 I'm not saying it was a bad thing, man. 
 It was kind of cute, really. 
 I mean, her just being free, you know, and not caught up in any of that morality bullshit. 
 I guess she kind of was special, in a way. 
 She wouldn't do that. 
 Damn, you're old-fashioned sometimes, Daniel. 
 You forced her to do it. 
 Forced her? Hell, she loved it. 
 I wasn't up there. 
 You know, at first, I thought you were digging on it, but then, later, I realized you were paralyzed. 
 [Bottle thuds] 
 That never happened. Not like that. 
 You know what? 
 If it'd been me, I would have gone down there and killed every son of a bitch who put anything inside of her. 
 But you, man, you just... 
 You just waited for us to leave, and then you killed her instead. 
 [Claps] 
 Hey! 
 [Laughing] 
 [Laughing] You're a psycho killer. 
 I mean, look at that... right there. 
 I mean, who throws a guy into a wall? 
 Let me up! 
 Let me up! 
 Get off me. 
 [Breathes heavily, coughs] 
 Oh. 
 I'm gonna let you explain that to Georgey. 
 That one's on you. 
 Is those yellows working? 
 Let's take another one. 
 Remember? 
 You are... who you are. Okay? 
 It's forever. 
 It's like being an Indian or something. 
 [Sighs] 
 I know you. 
 [Gulps] 
 [Breathes heavily] 
 Now you know you. 
 [Sighs] 
 If you ever really forgot. 
 [Music continues] 
 [Song ends, audience cheering]
