 Previously on Rectify... 
 Ted Jr. won't press charges. 
 This is bigger than him. 
 You did the right thing telling me this. 
 You're pregnant. You make me feel, Tawney. 
 Really feel, you know? 
 What happened in that interrogation room? 
 We put pressure on him. 
 And now you think the confession might have been coerced? 
 Daniel choked him into unconsciousness. 
 D.A.'s prepared to offer you a plea deal. 
 No more time. Not one day. 
 I'm worried that it will be a deal-breaker. 
 This is not a game, Daniel! 
 [Cellphone vibrating] 
 [Door closes] 
 Dr. Cassidy : The body has its own wisdom. 
 There's a logic to how it works. 
 It's important for you to know it's nothing you did. 
 Up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. 
 It's very common early on. 
 Usually it's due to chromosomal abnormalities... something not right in the egg, the sperm, the division process. 
 It's nature's way of preventing serious defects. 
 You may continue to have some bleeding for the next three, four days. 
 Use ibuprofen for any cramping. 
 Tawney, watch out for fever, chills, any back aches. 
 They may be signs of infection. 
 I'd need to know right away. 
 The best news is, Tawney, you're young. 
 So there's no reason you can't start trying again. 
 Soon as you're ready. 
 Ted Sr. : Tell me his exact words. 
 I don't recall his exact words, Ted. 
 He said it was late, Daniel had come to the store... 
 Were they drinking? 
 I don't know. 
 I'd say it's quite possible, though, considering. 
 He said they were arguing. 
 About what? 
 [Sighs] 
 About Teddy's wife. 
 I guess Daniel overstepped his boundaries. 
 Anyhow, they argued, then Daniel rushed up behind him and choked him out. 
 When Teddy regained consciousness, his pants were... 
 I... I know the rest. 
 But what I don't know, Carl, is why you felt compelled to share this very private information with the senator, who then called me down to the store... the family store, Carl... to tell me all the juicy details. 
 I told him he shouldn't. 
 And now, he wants me to convince my son to press charges against my wife's son. 
 Tell me why you did that. 
 [Sighs] 
 I suppose I was... seeking counsel. 
 From the man who put him on death row... made his whole career out of it. 
 It's assault, Ted, sexual assault. That's a very serious crime. 
 If Janet finds out about this, I don't know if she could come back from it. 
 But if I don't tell her now and she hears it from somewhere else... 
 You see my dilemma. 
 He wasn't even out a week, Ted. 
 Not seven days before he did this to Teddy. 
 That ain't right. 
 [Sighs] 
 Surely you can appreciate my dilemma. 
 Well, I could appreciate it more if you would have come to me first. 
 [Train whistle blows in distance] 
 Jon : A merry-go-round, Daniel? 
 It's a metaphor. 
 You asked for somewhere private. 
 Hiding in plain sight. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I'll say it again... 
 I'm your lawyer, first and foremost. 
 How's my sister feel about that? 
 I think she's getting the picture. 
 I'm sure it's not a pretty one. 
 She's been a part of this for a long time, Daniel. 
 It's hard for her to let go. 
 As it always has been. 
 So... [exhales sharply] 
 I spent the morning on the phone with the district attorney. 
 And? 
 We called their bluff. 
 She's agreed to time served. 
 That's good news. 
 And she dropped the rape charge, too. 
 Well played, Jon. 
 Not really. 
 How so? 
 That was the flaw in their case, Daniel, in the original narrative... how to answer for the DNA which wasn't yours. 
 Oh, so now they don't have to. 
 Exactly. 
 Truth is, we did them a favor asking for it. 
 A good deal is when everyone walks away happy, Jon. 
 Or at least equally unhappy. 
 They were saying yes to everything we were asking for. 
 Until now. 
 Until now. 
 So what do they want in return, Jon? 
 Banishment. 
 Banishment. 
 Ted Jr. : This is the third time I've called you this week, sir. 
 And... and as... as I mentioned before, your, uh, credit card was rejected, uh, for your rim renewal. 
 So I really need to get a new credit card from you. 
 Uh... so call me back when you can. 
 Thanks. Again. 
 Hey, there you are. 
 I've been calling you for half an hour. 
 I was in a meeting. 
 Tawney needs me at home. 
 Everything okay? 
 I don't know. I'm sure it's fine. 
 I'm sorry, son. 
 That I was late. 
 Ain't no big deal. Just let me know next time. 
 Got to function as a team here. 
 Okay. Be back in a little bit. 
 Take your time. I'll be here. 
 Amantha : They're shutting me out, mother... both boyfriend and brother. 
 They're not shutting you out. They just needed some room. 
 Room for what? 
 To discuss things, I suppose. 
 Is that what I do, mom? 
 Make people want to shut me out? 
 [Grunts] 
 Sometimes we have to watch what we say, honey. 
 Or how we say it. 
 And that's better than not saying anything at all? 
 Of course not. 
 As long as I can remember, I've had to follow you around, mom. 
 Literally. 
 Couldn't have started out that way. 
 You must have come to me at some point, when I was in my crib. 
 And even when I got you to stop and look at me, to acknowledge my existence, I still couldn't tell what you were thinking. 
 Or feeling. 
 So I always felt like I had to guess, or fill in the blanks, or push for some clue, until you would just get mad at me. 
 I'm sorry, honey. I really am. 
 And I know that's your nature, mom. 
 Just like it's Daniel's to be so... 
 [Sighs] 
 ... maddeningly private. 
 But because it's not my nature, or because I don't always read between the lines or understand that language, or because I want people to speak to me in my language sometimes, that does not make me the bad guy. 
 No, it doesn't. Quite the opposite. 
 I hate it. 
 Hate what? 
 The idea of a plea deal... I just hate it. 
 But I also hate the idea of him going back to jail. 
 And it could happen. I don't care what you say. 
 I have lived in this world for some time, Amantha, and one thing I have learned... it is not fair and it is not just. 
 The world is... absurd. 
 And if I could just have him and you and Jared and... 
 My family... 
 [Sighs] 
 ... What else is there? 
 I don't know. 
 I love you, Amantha. 
 So much. 
 [Lock turns] 
 Hey. 
 Everything okay? 
 I made you some cookies. 
 Thanks. 
 Let's have them over here. 
 You put the peanut-butter chips in them, too. 
 I did. 
 Getting all exotic on me. 
 Teddy, I'm not pregnant anymore. 
 I went to the doctor this morning and... 
 It's gone. 
 I'd been spotting a little bit, and I had some cramps, but I didn't think it was... 
 I didn't want to worry you, 'cause I... 
 It wasn't till this morning the bleeding got heavy, so... 
 You'd already left for work, so I... 
 And you went to the doctor? 
 She did an ultrasound. 
 An exam. 
 But... 
 I mean, she said it's pretty common... this early on. 
 One in five or something. 
 Chromosomes. 
 Chromosomes? 
 It's nothing we did, Teddy. It's... it's just nature's way. 
 She said I should just, you know... take it easy for a few days. 
 Why aren't you... 
 [Sighs] 
 You must be in shock. 
 I don't know. Um... 
 Maybe, I guess. 
 You want me to stay? 
 No, it's okay. I'm okay, I think. 
 I'm just gonna take it slow today, maybe lay in bed. 
 Do you want to take some cookies to your dad? 
 I'll wrap them up for you. 
 Just a few. 
 [grunts] 
 I don't know what to tell you, Sheriff. 
 I ain't seen him. 
 George hasn't used his bank card or his cellphone in over a month. 
 And we believe your son's missing... as in officially. 
 Phone records show he was in Paulie six weeks ago, but his phone hasn't pinged since. 
 Pinged? 
 Registered... on a cell tower. 
 It's a way to track someone's whereabouts. 
 Yeah, of course it is. 
 It's imperative that we find out what's happened here, sir. 
 This 'cause of Holden? 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Sighs] Something happened, all right. 
 Way back. With that girl. 
 How do you mean? 
 Well, they took George in. 
 Never even gave me a call. 
 Supposed to give parents a call, take a child in. 
 I woke up about 4:00 A.M., and he wasn't home. 
 Sun come up, went looking for him. 
 Ended up down at the station. 
 I was there on that bench all morning waiting to see George. 
 Did you see Senator Foulkes there? 
 Of course I did. 
 He was moving in and out of those rooms. 
 God knows what was going on. 
 They never even called Lester Holden at all. 
 Saying Daniel's 18, didn't need his daddy. 
 Didn't need a lawyer either, I guess. 
 George ever tell you what happened in those rooms? 
 He wasn't ever the same. 
 Well, the way he is now... 
 How do you mean, "the way he is now"? 
 We need to find him, sir. 
 I'm through talking, Sheriff. 
 Barbara : Good afternoon, sir. 
 I need to speak to the senator. 
 Did you have an appointment? 
 Tell him it's Ted Talbot. 
 I thought I heard a familiar voice. 
 Well, the door is always open to Ted Talbot, father or son. 
 Woke up on the wrong side of the bed, did you, Ted? 
 I didn't say it before, but I'll say it now. 
 Will you? 
 You're a vulture... preying on people, feasting on their misery. 
 Little dramatic for a tire salesman, isn't it, Ted? 
 Don't ever contact me or my family again. 
 This is a private matter. 
 It'll be handled within the family. 
 You want to talk predator and prey? 
 'Cause you got both under one roof... your roof. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, Ted... 
 I'm a politician. 
 I never claimed otherwise. 
 And having a case I prosecuted, a case as conspicuous and sensational as Holden's vacated is politically damaging to me. 
 I don't deny it, nor do I apologize for being sensitive to it. 
 But beyond the less pure motives I may harbor... 
 Beyond my ego, my legacy even, in my heart of hearts, I believe Daniel Holden killed that girl. 
 I believe it as strongly now as I did 20 years ago. 
 And I also have to believe, Ted, that somewhere in your heart of hearts, you've at least entertained that notion. 
 You can't just brush that off, Ted, or hope that it will just somehow go away. 
 Don't call me again. 
 [Lock turns] 
 I brought you some more music, Daniel. 
 No. 
 [Slow-tempo music plays] 
 [Scoffs] I said, "no." 
 I don't want to listen! 
 [Music stops] 
 Sorry, Daniel. 
 [Sighs] You are, yes. 
 I brought you a letter. 
 Just a random letter? 
 Charlie, I don't see the point in that. 
 It's from your sister. 
 My sister wrote you a letter? She's an atheist, Charlie. 
 [Chuckles] It's not for me, Daniel. 
 You know, the last three times she's come to visit, you made her sit in that cold, gray visiting room, phone in her hand, waiting for a brother that never shows. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm a ghost, Charlie. 
 The sooner they learn that, the better off they'll be. 
 Or the better off you'll be? 
 I changed my mind. Play some goddamn music. 
 No, I'd rather talk. We hardly do any of that. 
 For good reason. 
 What are you afraid of, Daniel? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 "Dearest Daniel... " 
 Don't. 
 "... I thought for once I'd write you a letter that wasn't about your case. 
 Charlie. 
 "Or about justice row, or the appeals process in Georgia, or about any of that legal crap. 'm sure you're quite tired of that by now. I thought maybe I'd write you a letter as if you were just... my brother. Which you are. Not my brother on death row. That is not who you are, Daniel. I hope you know that, and I hope you believe it. I love you, Daniel, even if you never speak to me again. I love you, always and forever, your sister... Amantha." 
 I have to be honest with you, Charlie Chaplain. 
 Yeah? 
 I thought you'd be funnier. 
 Thank you, Miss Becky. 
 
 
 
 [Register beeping] 
 You turd. 
 I just wanted to see your home away from home. 
 Ta-da. 
 It's, uh, well-lit. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Jon told me that your shift ends soon. 
 Did he, now? 
 Time for a chat afterwards? 
 The entire state of Georgia? 
 Apparently that's unconstitutional, so they banish you from every county in the state except one. 
 Which one? 
 Echols. 
 Never heard of it. 
 It's not convenient. 
 Of course it isn't. 
 So... what about Christmas? 
 Or birthdays? 
 Will they let you visit? 
 I don't know. 
 Yes, you do. 
 You still think this is a game, Daniel? 
 You still think you can play the system? 
 Because this is what it looks like when you do. 
 You will never set foot in our house again. 
 You will never sleep in your bed or eat at our table or help mom fix that damn kitchen. 
 I want to know that you understand that. 
 That you comprehend the fullness of what that means. 
 I certainly do. 
 Then why in the hell would you still want to do this? 
 Name one person, Amantha... just one... whose life is better since I've been out. 
 Name one person who's happier. 
 We are happier because you're out. 
 Bullshit answer. Name one. 
 Just because things are complicated doesn't mean that you give up, that you... run away and leave us all behind. 
 I haven't made my decision yet, Amantha. I just... 
 I wanted you to know. 
 Have you told mom yet? 
 No. 
 You have to tell her. 
 I know. 
 And you have to look her in the eyes when you say it. 
 I want you to see her heart break. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Come on in. 
 [Sighs] 
 I haven't done much reading lately with all that's been going on. 
 I thought I'd try to get a few chapters in. 
 Yeah, I... 
 I haven't read anything since I've gotten out. 
 Well, you'll get back into it. 
 It's been nice having you home the last couple of days. 
 I always sleep better when you are. 
 Not that I need you here every night or anything. 
 I sleep better here, too. 
 I've been thinking about time. 
 Yeah, it hangs over all of us. 
 I was thinking about what you told me the day you got out. 
 Do you remember? 
 Well, that was a big day, mother. 
 [Chuckles] Maybe it was the next day. 
 You talked about the, uh, the concept of time, I believe was the phrase. 
 That's a familiar theme of mine. 
 So... has anything changed with the concept itself? 
 Or do you still feel like you were... 
 Always there? 
 Not anymore. 
 The world has a way of... 
 Drawing you back in. 
 In spite of one's best efforts. 
 Always. 
 I'm getting bits and pieces as the days go by. 
 Memories. 
 The way the world was before I went away. 
 And memories of the days since I've gotten out. 
 I can imagine. 
 Mother... 
 ... I can't live here anymore. 
 I understand that. 
 [Sighs] 
 I... I might have to move somewhere... else. 
 Atlanta, maybe? 
 Well... 
 You could come home on weekends. 
 I could at that. 
 Oh, Amantha would love to help you get set up in Atlanta. 
 You're gonna need help, you know. 
 Yes, I... I'll need some help. 
 Is that why you came in here? 
 To tell me you couldn't live here anymore? 
 Yes, it was. 
 Well, that's not the end of the world, is it? 
 [Keys jingle] 
 [Lock turns] 
 Hey. 
 How far does the code of silence extend? 
 As far as it has to in order for me to do my job. 
 So, is that limited strictly to information regarding Daniel's case? 
 Or anything regarding Daniel at all? 
 Because so much of his life is about his case. 
 And so much of your life is about his case. 
 Maybe that's part of the problem. 
 Tends to happen when your brother goes to death row when you're 12, and you spend the next 20 years trying to get him out. 
 I'm a lawyer, Amantha. 
 That hasn't changed since the day you met me. 
 But other things have changed. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 But? 
 But nothing. 
 But this is hard. 
 But I'm tired of apologizing. 
 But you screwed his lawyer. 
 What did you expect? Deal with it. 
 I am just trying to do my job. 
 You shouldn't have told him about the plea deal. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I'm obligated to tell him. You know that. 
 He is unstable and broken and... and reckless. 
 And it is your obligation not to give him stupid ideas like a plea deal, because he's going to take it. 
 And then he's gonna be gone, and we're gonna lose him forever. 
 I am going to advise him against it... against taking the deal. 
 Too little, too late, Jon. I heard it in his voice. 
 Nothing is final until the judge signs off on it. 
 There's still time to change Daniel's mind. 
 Good luck with that. 
 [Ringing] 
 Anderson : Leave a message at the beep. [Beep] 
 This is very frustrating, Mr. Anderson. 
 Uh... very frustrating that you will not return my phone calls, that you will not pay for your rims. 
 The next step is gonna be repossession, and neither one of us want that, sir. 
 So please call me back. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 Tawney? 
 Tawney : I'm up here. 
 Taking it easy? 
 Just doing some reading, planning. 
 School? 
 Yeah. 
 How was the rest of your day? 
 Weird. 
 Sad. 
 I'm sorry, Teddy. 
 Any pains or anything? 
 Not really. 
 Uh... there's a little bit of bleeding still, but nothing major. 
 Okay. 
 I had some dinner, and I'm... I don't know. 
 I'm almost feeling normal. 
 Normal? 
 West Georgia, Kennesaw State... 
 Georgia Southern. 
 Just doing some research. 
 None of those are close to home. 
 You moving out on me? 
 What? No. 
 They have online courses. 
 Online. Sure. 
 I think I'm gonna get ready for bed. 
 You never wanted it, did you? 
 In your heart of hearts. 
 Just tell me the truth. 
 Why would you say that? 
 'Cause I got this thing that's been bugging me. 
 "Why isn't she happier?" 
 "She should be happier." 
 I know it's been... it's been hard. 
 Has it, Tawney? 
 Has it been a hard day? 
 Baking cookies and planning your life? 
 With no... no baby now, holding you back? 
 I think we both need to get some sleep. 
 With who? 
 Sleep with who? 
 Unbelievable. 
 It is, Tawney. 
 Unbelievable... that I thought you wanted my baby. 
 Teddy... 
 And now he's gone and got himself a plea deal. 
 Out there in the free world, just walking around, yours for the taking. 
 You have no idea... I have no idea what? 
 That you goddamn love Daniel? 
 That you wish that was his baby inside you? 
 Blind man could see that. 
 [Sobs] 
 [Scoffs] 
 Oh, there they are. 
 [Crying] 
 There are them tears, finally. 
 You can't cry for our baby, but the first mention of that b*st*rd's name and here come the waterworks. 
 Go on, then. 
 Why don't you run to him, Tawney? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sniffles] 
 I can't do this anymore, Teddy. 
 I don't want... 
 You don't want what? 
 You don't want to be here anymore? 
 Then go. Take off. 
 The world's yours. 
 Don't you look away from me. 
 [Sighs] 
 Don't look away from me. 
 I'm your hero today. 
 I'm giving you what you want. 
 It's what you wanted since the moment you set eyes on him. 
 [Sobs] 
 You should be thanking me. 
 You have to stop this. 
 Run to him. 
 Lie with him. 
 Give him your body. 
 Let him dig into you. 
 That rapist, that killer, the guy who... 
 The guy who what? 
 Who loves you like you love him. 
 [Crying] 
 [Sighs] 
 I... I can't do this anymore, Ted. 
 I'm tired. 
 So tired of it all. 
 [Crying] 
 It ain't Christian to get divorced. 
 I know that. 
 So maybe you'll get lucky, Tawney. 
 Maybe he'll kill you, too. 
 Strangle your throat until you're blue, put you out of your misery. 
 I'm leaving. 
 Go on, then. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sobs] 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Tawney, call me back. Please. 
 Let me know where you are so we can talk. 
 [Sighs]

 Next Thursday... 
 Is Daniel around? 
 He didn't come in last night. 
 The shocking season finale of Rectify. 
 You shouldn't take the deal. 
 I just want it to be over, Jon. 
 If you say that you killed her, you are a coward. 
 Tell me how we make this right, Daniel. 
 He's taken everything... taken off me. 
 Walk us through the night of the murder. 
 I want to hear it from the horse's mouth. 
 Did you kill Hanna Dean?
