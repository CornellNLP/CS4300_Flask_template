 [ Exhales ] 
 Mmm. 
 Hey. 
 I know you. 
 Now, where you headed? 
 Daniel : I don't know. 
 Not all who wander are lost. 
 Yeah. 
 Till you get things figured out, you reckon you could give me a hand with a little chore? 
 I don't mind. 
 [ Inhales ] 
 "Can do" attitude. 
 [ Music ] 
 How'd you get here? 
 Kerwin : Through the wall. 
 That's not possible. 
 Shh. 
 It's weird, isn't it? 
 What is? 
 That I know exactly when I'm gonna die. 
 That's very sad, Kerwin. 
 It has its pluses. 
 You can grieve your own death. 
 [ Music ] 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ Car door slams ] 
 Forgot my key. 
 Shh... [ Bleating ] 
 Hey, can I stay back here with 'em? 
 Nah, they'll be fine. 
 I'm the one need the company. 
 [ Music ] 
 Slide down. 
 Get low in your seat. 
 Best they don't see that you're with me. 
 You can peek out once in a while. 
 [ Music ] 
 Oh! 
 Damn! 
 [ Music ] 
 [ Bleating ] 
 [ Baby crying ] 
 [ Chatter, sirens wailing ] 
 Ah! 
 Where'd ya go, son? 
 You wanna see somethin' different? 
 Know you're tempted, but don't peek. 
 [ Cattle mooing ] 
 There she blows. 
 [ Music ] 
 Somebody made that up. 
 [ Music ] 
 It's the beauty that hurts you most, son, not the ugly. 
 [ Music ] 
 [ Grunting ] 
 Ha-ha-ha! 
 [ Grunting ] 
 Ow! 
 Ha! 
 Huh. 
 Ha-ha. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 You ain't goin' nowhere. 
 Come here. 
 Come here, you. 
 Come on. 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Music ] 
 Come on. 
 [ Panting ] 
 He's skinny, but he's forked. 
 Ha. 
 [ Music ] 
 [ Goats bleating ] 
 This is your trip, but you're about to pull a 360. 
 You gonna run 'em off a cliff? 
 What? 
 Like swine? 
 You read too much. 
 I put a knot on your head. 
 I think so. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ Snorts ] 
 Oh. 
 [ Snorting ] 
 Oh! 
 Once it opens up, it's hard to staunch. 
 Whoa, Nelly. 
 What? 
 Stop. 
 What? 
 Stop! 
 That's it? 
 That's the sign you was lookin' for? 
 Them damn things is everywhere. 
 Hey! 
 You did me a solid. 
 It's yours. 
 I don't want any. 
 You can't get nowhere in this world without money. 
 [ Music ] 
 Hey. 
 Are you real? 
 Am I real? 
 [ Laughter ] 
 I want some of what you're takin'. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ Music ] 
 [ Beeping ] 
 Tawney : Welcome home, husband. 
 Ted : Hi. 
 How was it? 
 Informative. 
 In a good way? 
 Maybe. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I missed you. 
 Teddy? 
 Yeah. 
 I want you to keep an open mind. 
 Okay. 
 I believe there's been a miracle, a real miracle. 
 Really? 
 It was the most beautiful thing, Teddy. 
 It strengthened my faith. 
 What happened? 
 Daniel's gonna be saved. 
 What? 
 [ Music ] 
 Ted : Daniel, what a nice surprise. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Remember when you were a kid, and you came back to that place you were years later, and everything seemed so small? 
 Yeah. 
 But, it seems bigger now. 
 You want some coffee? 
 It's nothin' fancy, just made. 
 I'd like that, Ted. 
 Tawney : Well, we were getting ready for the jubilee. 
 Ted Jr. : At our church? 
 Uh, yes. 
 And we were making casseroles, and-and-- oh, Pastor Beau met him and was so welcoming. 
 And we got to talkin'. 
 You and-- you and Daniel got to talkin'? 
 Yes, Teddy, about big things. 
 S-so, you invited him to our church? 
 Isn't that what we're supposed to do as Christians? 
 Well, of course, it is, Tawney. 
 But, I mean, our church? 
 Honey, they're practically the last group that buys tires from us. 
 Well, that's not gonna stop. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 What? 
 It just doesn't make any sense to me. 
 What doesn't? 
 I mean, look, the Holdens have never been religious people. 
 I mean, none of 'em. 
 And I'm pretty sure Amantha's a full-blown atheist, and if she does believe in God, she probably hates his guts. 
 Why can't you ever see the good in people? 
 I see good in people. 
 And why can't God perform miracles in this town, right now? 
 Of course, he can. 
 I-I-- 
 I saw it in his eyes. 
 You saw what? 
 A goodness and a need. 
 A need for what? 
 For God, Teddy, a need for God. 
 Oh, boy. 
 He wants to be cleansed-- cleansed of all he's been through. 
 Now, I saw it, and I felt it. 
 He's-he's seekin'-- what's that word? 
 He's seekin' absolution. 
 Why do you care about him so much? 
 Because he's one of God's children, and-and I believe he has suffered unjustly, terribly so, maybe more than Job. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 What? 
 Nothin'. 
 Why do you hate him so much? 
 Hate him? 
 I don't even know him. 
 Hell, that's part of the problem. 
 All I know, is he got off death row six days ago on some DNA thing I still don't fully understand. 
 And now, you're hangin' out with him, as soon as I leave town! 
 Daniel : It was nice of you to marry my mother. 
 Ted : Nice of me? 
 I'm the lucky one. 
 I remember him. 
 I'm not plannin' to work here. 
 I just wanted you to know. 
 Somebody been talkin' to you? 
 When I was a kid, I-- even then, I knew I wouldn't work here. 
 I just wasn't... 
 I wanted to tell him, but I couldn't. 
 Somethin' like that would be hard for a boy to tell his father. 
 In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't. 
 You don't trust my judgment, do you? 
 I think you see the good in everybody you meet, Tawney. 
 But, I'm here to tell you not all people are good. 
 I know good, decent people, people I've known my whole life, people I would trust my own children with, that believe in their hearts that he is a cold-blooded killer. 
 And you can't dismiss that just because you don't want it to be true. 
 Now, look, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. 
 Okay? 
 For you, for mom, for dad, Jared, hell, even Amantha. 
 All I'm saying, is for him to be on death row all those years, knowing what was facing him, and he didn't do nothin' to get right with the Lord, and then he gets out, and in six days, he gets testified to by some pretty, young woman-- 
 I don't appreciate-- 
 ...and all of a sudden, he's filled with the spirit! 
 I'm sorry, but that seems pretty damn suspicious to me. 
 I don't think-- I believe he meant it. 
 Then there's nothin' left to talk about. 
 I'm gonna go check on dad. 
 Got the big semi-annual tire sale comin' up. 
 A lot of good that's gonna do.

 Hey, bud. 
 See the dancing man? 
 Hope you got it on sale. 
 Got all the fliers, 5,000. 
 Five thousand? 
 Got a good deal. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'm worried where we're gonna find 5,000 cars to put 'em on. 
 One at a time. 
 I think we'll be lucky to get one in five hundred of those to even come in. 
 That'll be somethin'. 
 How was the seminar? 
 It was okay. 
 Everything all right at home? 
 Yeah-- it's fine, dad. 
 Where-where's the ceramic mechanic? 
 Oh, Daniel took it. 
 What? 
 Well, he came by here. 
 He looked kinda pitiful, too. 
 Yeah. He's got that look down. 
 What did he want with the mechanic? 
 Well, it belonged to his daddy. 
 It belongs to the store! 
 Well, I didn't know you cared so much for it. 
 I touch it every day that I come in here! 
 Really? 
 Why? 
 I don't know, luck or-- never mind why I touch it. 
 The point is, I touch it! 
 We'll get another one. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 That's not the point, dad. 
 Why don't you go back home, get some rest, and I'll put out the fliers? 
 No, I'll put 'em out. 
 I need to get some fresh air. 
 Ugh... 
 
 
 
 [ Music ] 
 Amantha : Do we know what time he made his escape? 
 Janet : No, but he stopped by the store mid-morning to see your dad. 
 Dad? 
 Oh, Ted, I mean. 
 Ted say how he was doin'? 
 Disheveled. 
 So, what do we do? 
 Call the men in white coats? 
 Are there still men in white coats? 
 I hope not. 
 Hmm... how about the men in white hats? 
 They never existed. 
 Deep down, you're darker than I am, mother. 
 Admit it. 
 I don't think I wanna do that, Amantha. 
 Well, I guess we just wait, then. 
 I think so. 
 He'll be-- 
 f*cked up. 
 I'm gonna start finishing my own sentences. 
 Please, mother, don't take away one of my few pleasures. 
 Mom! 
 Janet! 
 It's Teddy! 
 Lord works in mysterious ways. 
 Be right down! 
 I hope it's okay I just dropped by like I always have. 
 Of course. 
 No pie. 
 That's okay. No worries. 
 There's monkey bread on the counter. 
 Teddy? 
 Sure. 
 So, Daniel adjusting okay? 
 Splendidly. 
 I can't say I wasn't a little surprised by his decision. 
 Decision? 
 He didn't tell ya? 
 What decision? 
 Turning his life over to the Lord. 
 What? 
 Washed in the blood. 
 What in the hell are you talkin' about, Teddy? 
 Daniel's getting baptized tonight at the jubilee. 
 I assumed ya'll knew. 
 [ Music ] 
 [ Chatter, laughter ] 
 Jared : Hey, Daniel. 
 Daniel : Hey, Jared. 
 Been a while. 
 Yeah-- heard that. 
 It's a trip thinkin' of you being here, now. 
 Yeah, I bet. 
 Can we help you with something? 
 Uh, you want me to call mom? 
 See if she can come pick you up? 
 I'll walk. 
 Thank you, though. 
 Get back to class. 
 Ted Jr. : Daniel and Tawney been hanging out a little bit. 
 Amantha : When? 
 When I was out of town, for one. 
 They met at the church. 
 She might've hung out with him here-- I don't know. 
 She hasn't. 
 How do you know? 
 What's your point? 
 My point? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 You ever think how it makes me feel to have to come over here? 
 I don't really care how you feel, Ted. 
 Janet : Amantha. 
 I just thought you'd like to know. That's all. 
 Thought you assumed we already did. 
 In case you didn't. 
 Boy, I knew you'd crucify the messenger, especially if it was me. 
 Oh, I'm sure it was just torture for you to come over here and drop a big, fat turd right at our feet. 
 That's enough. 
 Bless your little heart. 
 Really! 
 [ Door closing ] 
 Hello? 
 Danny? 
 Well, great monkey bread. 
 [ Music ] 
 Daniel? 
 Daniel? 
 What? 
 Can we speak with you? 
 Uh, okay. 
 How ya doin', buddy? 
 Very well. How are you? 
 Well, we're worried about ya, honey. 
 Why? 
 Well-- 
 Because we love you. 
 Love is patient and kind. 
 Love is not jealous, or boastful, or proud. 
 That's a lot of money. 
 Is it? 
 For cash, looks like it. 
 You think it was ill-gotten? 
 No. 
 I don't think that. 
 Mother? 
 I don't know, Daniel. 
 I don't, either. 
 I have to get ready. 
 Where ya headed? 
 You don't know? 
 We know. 
 Well, if you know, then why did you ask? 
 Because we don't know how to talk to you, honey. 
 Just talk-- say it. 
 What? 
 I couldn't think of his name. 
 Daniel, we think that you should consider holding off going through with the-- 
 Being saved? 
 Maybe you should sleep on it. 
 Have you been gettin' much sleep? 
 Can you guarantee I'll be here? 
 What do you mean? 
 It could happen at any time. 
 What could? 
 Anything-- anything could happen at any time. 
 Oh... and now, I don't have time. 
 Time? Daniel? 
 Daniel, please? 
 Please what? 
 Please be the way you want me to be? 
 No. I just want you to be happy. 
 I will be happy. 
 When I'm cleansed, I will be happy. 
 Daniel, please? 
 I don't know how you want me to be! 
 But, Daniel-- 
 I'm not even sure if I'm alive! 
 Oh... honey-- 
 Just stop! 
 Stop living your life for me, Amantha. 
 I never asked you to, ever! 
 Now, please, I'd like to walk through that door like a person.

 Daniel : I feel I have reason, now. 
 Tawney : Yes, you do. 
 Just to-to be here, to be right here-- 
 God has a plan for you, Daniel. 
 I'm alive, Tawney. 
 Hmm... I would say so. 
 I thought I was dead when I was in there. 
 You know, and out here, I-I still didn't believe it, that I was alive. 
 It-it was like a-- I thought it was like a dead man's dream, you know? 
 You'll never die now, Daniel. 
 Will you ever die, Tawney? 
 No. 
 I'm so glad. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ Crying ] 
 Hey, don't be ashamed. 
 God is releasing your pain. 
 Where does it go? 
 He takes it. 
 You make me so happy, Tawney. 
 It's Jesus who makes you happy, not me. 
 What? 
 You know, the goat man told me it's the beauty, not the ugly, that hurts the most. 
 The goat man? 
 I was with him today. 
 We-we walked, and we gathered all the goats together. 
 And there was this girl, and she had a head of another girl in her hands, and-- but, she had a goat's body. 
 And that was after I-I'd gone to her window. 
 Whose window? 
 And we wrestled. 
 I knew I was wrestling with myself. 
 And he could've won. 
 He had me, but he helped me up, and we walked together. 
 And the tall man at the store led me back-- back to my father. 
 To your father? 
 To Ted's, back to Ted's, and to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and-and finally, back here to you. 
 May I kiss you, Tawney? 
 [ Music ] 
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. That-- 
 It's okay. 
 You're just-- 
 Filled with the spirit. 
 Yes? 
 Yes. 
 [ Music ] 
 How about I call your mama, Daniel? 
 No. 
 Thank you for everything, Tawney. 
 Let me give you a ride home. 
 You're all wet. 
 One day, maybe I'll let you give me a ride home. 
 I like it out here. 
 Do you feel all the life? 
 I do. 
 Maybe there is a God. 
 Good-bye, Tawney. 
 [ Music ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Damn it, dad. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Stupid idea. 
 Hey, Ted! 
 Don't kill him. 
 Let him dance. 
 Sure, buddy. 
 Ugh... 
 So, you did the deed, huh? 
 I did. 
 How was it? 
 Fantastical. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Fantastical, huh? 
 You want some coffee? 
 You can watch your friend from inside. 
 I like coffee. 
 So, all your sins are forgiven now, huh? 
 That must be a load off. 
 I'm not sure. 
 Not sure about what? 
 Seemed so, at first, that I had truly been cleansed. 
 But then, I-- it's confusing-- I-- 
 Nothing confusing. 
 Your sins are either forgiven, or they're not. 
 Doesn't seem so black and white, Ted. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Cut the sh1t, buddy. 
 It's me you're talkin' to. 
 That's right. 
 I don't buy your lost soul lie for a minute. 
 You didn't wanna get right with God. 
 You wanted to get right with my wife, right in bed with her. 
 No-- no-- that's not true. 
 Listen. You want a piece of ass? 
 Then you go pick up some skank at the bar, but you stay the hell away from my Tawney. 
 You hear me? 
 She's out of bounds, off limits. 
 Is that clear enough? 
 Yes. 
 I-I shouldn't be around her. 
 Hell, I'm not sure you should be around anybody. 
 Stay the hell away from me while you're at it. 
 [ Music ] 
 You know, one thing's just been buggin' the sh1t out of me. 
 What's that? 
 When you was telling me that sickening shower story, which I still don't understand why you told me somethin' like that-- 
 You asked. 
 But, when you said how it doesn't do any good to fight back, you know, 'cause there was too many of 'em or somethin'-- you remember that? 
 You remember saying that? 
 I do remember that. 
 Now, what I wanna know is, is did you fight back? 
 Or, did you just relax and enjoy it? 
 It's not that simple. 
 It's exactly that simple. 
 There are things you don't know. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Yeah-- well, long as there's things you know. 
 [ Music ] 
 Weirdo coming in here and doing everything. 
 Hey! 
 [ Grunting ]
