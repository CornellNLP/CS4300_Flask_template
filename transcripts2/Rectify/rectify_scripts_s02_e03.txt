 [ Squeaking ] 
 You do windows now? 
 Side effect of the coma. 
 Doctor didn't mention that as a possibility. 
 [ Grunts ] It's rare. 
 Seriously, you're not pushing it, are you, brother? 
 I think I can manage a few panes. 
 Didn't you get an apartment? 
 The amenities are nicer here. 
 God, I can't believe you're upright. 
 Makes two of us. 
 [ Voice breaking ] I thought we were gonna lose you. 
 No crying, sister. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Sorry. 
 Emotion is for losers. 
 Will you at least let me do the windows? 
 It's driving me crazy. 
 No, I want to-- do things, you know? 
 Being up, and it helps-- moving. 
 Can I at least give you a hug? 
 Oh, definitely no hugs. 
 My ribs are still pretty sore. 
 That's 'cause four of them were broken and not a damn thing's been done about it. 
 What? 
 Fritters. 
 Fritters? 
 Apple fritters. 
 [ Laughs ] Oh, God. 
 You mean from Swint's Doughnuts? 
 Please tell me they haven't shut down. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Obesity's the only thing still selling in this economy. 
 Oh, I dreamed about them. 
 Well, I am gonna go get us some, then. 
 I wasn't fishing. 
 Sure you weren't. [ Laughs ] 
 You don't mind? 
 Ugh, I so need purpose. 
 Besides, a fritter a day... 
 Something to look forward to? 
 Everybody needs that. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Janet : Think you slept good through the night again, as far as I can tell. 
 I'll take that as a positive. 
 Absolutely. 
 I couldn't help but peek my head in his room a time or two, though. [ Chuckles lightly ] 
 Part of me wanted to wake him up to make sure I could wake him up. 
 [ Chuckles ] I hear you. 
 Man :  The vast majority of looms are found in homes. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Ted, I think I finally want to redo the kitchen. 
 I think Daniel wants to do it, too. 
 You know, when he's feeling up to it. 
 It'd be fun for us to have a little project. 
 Little? 
 Well, you know what I mean. 
 I think it's finally just time, if we hire the right people. 
 I couldn't believe it was one of the first things he mentioned when he woke up. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hard for me to wrap my head right now around a remodel, Janet. 
 You know the store's been struggling. 
 Well, I just thought, maybe if we were smart-- 
 And it's just not a good time, you know? 
 I don't want you to be mad about this. 
 I'm just saying it's a bad time. 
 That's all. 
 Okay. 
 Doesn't mean it can't happen eventually. 
 Just... not now. 
 I think those girls' rugs are pretty. 
 Man :  ...from Afghanistan, they bring to Pakistan. 
 Today, around 80% of Afghan carpets are finished in Pakistan, then shipped abroad... Thank you. A dozen assorted? Yes, ma'am. That's $8.95, dear. Hi? I just thought the world of your daddy. I remember him bringing you in when you were just a little thing. You and... your brother. Daddy was, uh... [ Chuckles ] A lot of people liked him. And, dear... I'm glad they got Bobby Dean. What? They arrested him. They up and got him. I live right down the block from Judy and them. I saw them take him. And no matter what they say about your brother, that shouldn't happen to him like that. [ Rattling ] Did you ever get to sleep last night? Little bit. [ Sighs ] I got a business appointment, so... Teddy... Yeah. I was thinking maybe we could do something together tonight. Some sort of date-night thing on purpose. What do you think? What specifics did you have in mind? Maybe go to that new Italian place on McCauley Street. They serve cheese as dessert. That's weird. Think it's European. I don't think I'm up for a restaurant tonight. Well, I could-- I could make that fancy mac and cheese you loved that time. [ Gulping ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs heavily ] [ Bottle clatters ] Sure. Date night. Thank you. What are you thanking me for? Just because, I guess. [ Door closes ] Doughnuts? Where's Daniel? Upstairs, I think. What's wrong? They arrested Bobby Dean. What? They friggin' arrested him! I don't even know how-- Oh, my. It's hard to believe, right? [ Telephone rings ] Hello? Yes. It's the Sheriff. Oh, I understand. Yes, uh, I'd need to make sure, but... But, yes, uh... Thank you, Sheriff. Goodbye. [ Telephone beeps ] He's coming by. He asked. He asked if he could, but... he's coming by. Here? This afternoon. He wants to talk to Daniel. What's he want to talk with Daniel about? Police work, I suppose. I don't know. But he was asking, not telling. I'm getting a doughnut. We have to tell him. I know. We don't want Daggett coming by without-- I know. But it's good news. Absolutely. [ Engine revving in distance ] [ Revving continues ] I'll go. [ Revving continues ] Hey, Daniel. Here's your fritter. Something sweet in the morning. It's everything, isn't it? It's something. How you feeling? You doing okay? I had a headache setting in, but I took one of the pain pills the doctors gave me. That's good. Mother... Yes, Daniel. I'd like to drive. Oh. Okay. Of course. Why wouldn't you? You don't mean right now, do you? Why-- why not? Well... the thing is, honey, it might be best if we got you your license first. Don't want to test the long arm of the law now, do we? [ Engine shuts off ] I don't think so. Daniel-- It's mostly... buttons and-- and knobs now. There's no... Everything's rounder. Hmm. I never really thought about it before, but I think you're right. More-- more curves, less angles. Honey? Plastic, polymers... Sheriff Daggett called just a minute ago. He asked if it might be all right if he stopped by in a little while. Daniel? That's fine, mother. He can come whenever. I think I might... play in the car a while longer. Great. Have fun. What? You want to take these inside? [ Chuckles ] No. Of course not. Don't be silly. Enjoy your fritter. [ Car door closes ] Thanks, mama. Ted Jr. : Considering I have the brick-and-mortar space already available in the tire store, I just need the capital for the rim inventory itself. You don't have any ownership stake in Paulie Tire yourself. Is that correct? Not officially, Gretchen, but what I do have is knowledge of the emerging trends in the tire and rim business, both from my 10 years on the ground, so to speak, and because it's right there in the TIA's annual figures from '08 to 2012. After the economic crash in '08, you'll notice a big-time uptick in customers choosing rental or rent-to-own options in rims-- 29% nationally and even more than that in Georgia. And-- and it's not limited to any, um... specific demographic, if you know what I'm saying. [ Clears throat ] It's interesting. It  is  interesting... Gretchen. It's a sound plan, Ted, but, unfortunately, there's not any business assets listed here, other than your truck, to qualify as collateral. I understand, and that's why what I-- Well, what about your father? Could he co-sign with you? Unfortunately, the tire store's not in his name. Oh. It's in my mom's. M-my stepmom's. Well, what about her? Could your dad talk to her? Oh, yeah. Of course he could. Of course. Well, that sounds like the best option. What about my house? With the equity I already got in it, it should be more than enough. So, now you're saying that you want to put up your house as collateral? I'm saying the business is a slam dunk, Gretchen. So, yes, my house. Okay. [ Clears throat ] Let me take a look at the numbers here. I kind of want to do this on my own, you know? Mm-hmm. I see here that your wife is on the deed, as well. That's right. And... Not a problem. She's all behind it. [ Engine shuts off ] [ Car door closes ] Don't expect me to thank you for doing your job. I don't. You were the victim of a crime, Mr. Holden. And that crime's been investigated, and that investigation's led to the arrest of a suspect. Now-- [ Chair creaks ] Oh, sorry about the chair. It's-- Don't worry about the chair. That who you saw? May I hold it? Of course. Bobby Dean. Yep. We know others were involved, but Mr. Dean's the one we identified for certain. I remember there being a lot of boots. It's perfectly okay if that's all you remember. I saw his face, though. Only for one or two seconds, but... it wasn't him. [ Chair creaks lightly ] What's that now? It wasn't Bobby Dean. I saw his face. You already said that. It was a guy I'd... I'd never seen before. Or since. A guy I didn't know. So, what'd the fella look like, then? Different. Different? Yes. Wasn't Bobby Dean? No. And if anybody needed me to, I would... testify in court to that fact. W-why would you need to testify to that? It was just an offer. An offer to who? Bobby Dean, I suppose. Daggett! Hey! [ Door opens ] Sheriff? That boy sees a pile of sh1t on the ground, he's gonna make every damn effort to step in it. If he gets his head kicked in again... Excuse me? What's going on? Just-- just tell me, please. He said it wasn't Bobby Dean. What? Flat-out said it wasn't him. Of course it was Bobby Dean. You think I don't know that? It's always been a mystery to me what you actually know. I did what I could. Daniel? [ Sighs ] Daniel? [ Grunts ] Not now. When? [ Sighs ] Later. It's always later. [ Grunting ] Man : Looks like you're going about this the hard way, my man. Just banging your head against the wall. Not metaphorically, either. The metaphorical way can end up hurting just as bad, though. But it would bleed less. I'm not authorized to prescribe medication. Something that might make life a little easier. At least easier than picking fights with cert teams. But if an inmate makes the request himself... then I'm required to run their request up the flagpole. Feel-good drugs? Feel-less-bad drugs, maybe. You get what I'm saying? I do. And I will take it under advisement. Thank you. You be easy now. Guard! 
 
 [ Breathing heavily ] [ Metal jangling ] Hash browns, three orders. Oh, hell, four. Five. Five hash browns. An order of steak and eggs. Comes with hash browns. Bonus. How you want your eggs? Doesn't say. Over easy? I don't think that would travel too well. Where you headed? Death row. Kidding. Let's go with scrambled. Toast? Biscuit? People like biscuits. Perfect. Anything else? Two waffles. Want anything on it? What? Strawberries, blueberries, chocolate chips? Chocolate chips? Okay. No, I mean, people put chocolate chips on their waffles? Some people. Plain. Syrup. Thank you. I don't know, Teddy. You don't know what? It just seems like we're rushing into things, doesn't it? I've been working on this for a long time, Tawney. I-I know, honey, but-- but if your-- your daddy doesn't think it's a good idea-- Dad doesn't know good ideas. He only knows old ones. Uh... Are you siding with him now? I'm not siding with anybody. I-I-- It's just that this is our house, honey. And that's why we can leverage it. Or we could lose it. Yeah, we could. Especially if we don't do something different other than sell a few tires every week to old white people. I-I-I'm not saying that I'm not gonna sign it. I'm just saying that I-- I think I need to know more about the business plan and all. Well, I tell you what, Tawney. Why don't you go work in the tire business for a decade or so, track all the significant changes over that time period, and then you get back to me with that business plan and all? Teddy, wait. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Grunting ] [ Thumping ] [ Door opens, closes ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] I saw it fall this morning. You saw it fall? I heard it, too, if you were curious. I think that the two of us could drag it onto your grass. Oh, yeah? Sure. That'd be great. I guess. I'll get back here. 1, 2, 3. [ Grunts ] Good grief! Thing's a bear. One more time. 1, 2, 3. [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] Are you okay? [ Breathing heavily ] Should I go get your mother? No, I'm fine. Thank you. To go beyond is as wrong as falling short. How's that? I just need to sit for a while. Of course. Yeah. As long as you need. Why in God's name would he do that? You got to be wondering that, too. Please don't make me feel like I'm the only one. He's got to move back to Atlanta with me, right? I mean, after he pulls this stunt. What stunt? Janet : There you are. Want a doughnut? What-- what was Daniel's stunt? You don't want to know. I heard they arrested Bobby Dean. [ Grunting ] How long have you lived here? Six years or so. This is a nice neighborhood. We got a good deal. Lots of squirrels. Eh, they're a nuisance. [ Grunting ] [ Engine shuts off ] Dr. Perlmutt : Ted. Teddy! Hey! Your, uh... He needs some assistance. No, I-I'm fine. I'm fine! He got dizzy. Do you mind? Sure! No, I'm good. I-I'm good. He's not good. Why don't you let me give you a hand there? No, I'm-- I'm fine, really. Come on. Just till we get across the street. Sure, Ted. Very kind of you. No problema. Thanks for your help. Daniel : Good intentions. I thought I could help. Sometimes we confuse feeling better with being well. That's very observant, Ted. Listen, Ted, I don't exactly know how to broach this. Yep, I think you just need to get a little bit of rest, and... let these womenfolk look after you. That's good advice, Ted. Don't mention it. People have their reasons for base jumping and snake-handling. That doesn't mean their reasons aren't stupid as sh1t! All right, Amantha, let's just-- Hey. Hey, there. Hey. Ted Jr. : He got a little dizzy. Goodness. I thought I could help a neighbor move a limb. What? I'm better now. Maybe you should sit. Okay. Hey, Teddy. What brings you here? Oh, I, uh... Could I have a quick word with you? Of course. So... what were you thinking, Daniel? Everything okay, Teddy? Oh, yeah. It's fine. I thought I could help. No. When you said that it wasn't Bobby Dean who beat you evidently senseless, what were you thinking? What? Amantha : Exactly, Jared. Anyway, I've got this great business plan. Oh. Yes, Ted mentioned it. Rims or something? Rim rentals. Yes, ma'am. And it is-- Make me understand this on some semi-logical level. Half logic is-- is not logical. You want to give Bobby Dean a second chance? Is that it? Death by boots. Yes, that's it, Amantha. I'm sorry, Teddy. This isn't a good time. Of course. I-- If I could just get you-- But whatever you and Ted decide is fine by me. I trust you. Amantha : Why? Daniel, why? What good would it have done, Amantha? For one, Bobby Dean's skeezy ass would be in jail right now. To what end? Do you like these, mother? Uh... yes, I've always liked those wedgewood stoves. He almost killed you, Daniel. It doesn't matter. What doesn't? What would happen next, Amantha? I mean, Bobby would go to prison, his mother would go to visit, and then after that, and-- and-- and after that. When would it ever end? Now, that-- I like-- I like this stove. Do you-- do you like this stove, Jared? It's okay, I guess. [ Scoffs ] You can't let him get away with what he did to you. Who says he's getting away with it? I like this tile, mother. Janet : Ted says we can't afford to have someone do the kitchen right now. Oh, well, there are other ways, mother. Hello?! You can't just-- I can, Amantha! Listen to me. I'm done with it. And you don't have to be. Bobby, the Sheriff, the town-- you can all keep playing. I'm done with it. You think they're done with it? You think Roland Foulkes is done with it? He is gonna come after you again and again, and if you don't end up in another hospital bed, you are gonna end up in a courtroom. This is not a game, Daniel! Isn't it? You're too sure about things, Amantha. This is absolutely insane! No. We're the ones insane. Oh, honey. Well, this whole damn family-- we're a bunch of freaks. [ Door opens ] See what happens? [ Motor whirring ] Amantha : Honestly, mother, sometimes I think he... I don't know. I don't know. Janet : I'm worried, honey. Finally. About you. Me? Because I'm willing to confront him, to-- to ask him why? No. It's just... maybe you should think about heading back to Atlanta by yourself for a while. Jobs are hard to find around here anyway. What? Might be best if you got some time away from all of it. From Daniel, you mean? From the family? Just think about it. Crowd chanting : Stop killing now! Stop killing now! [ Buzzer ] Jon : Sorry everything's cold. Uh, it takes a while to get it through all of the... protocol. Strip-searched my hash browns, huh? Bunch of animals. No small thing, bringing me this food. Kindness for a dead man. Not a problem. Sure it ain't. What? Why, Hollis? You a priest now or something? Looking for a deathbed confession? Why did you keep saying it wasn't your DNA? I don't know. Seemed like my only option, I guess. But it wasn't an option. It was your DNA, and you knew it. Not my best-laid plan, Jonny. I'll give you that. Do you know how much money we spent? How many people believed in you? Your-- your mother, your sister, us? Yeah, I feel bad about that now. Do you? Not really, to be honest. That's the first thing you said that I believe, Hollis. Okay, Mr. Stern, a little parting gift-- I'm wired different, Jon. Have been as long as I can remember. Who knows why? Daddy left, mama crazy, got dropped on my head-- none of the above. Doesn't really matter, does it? Just is. So it's fun to pretend, you know? Pretend I was normal. [ Sniffs ] Have y'all treat me like I was human, like I was something other than the monster they say I am. That sh1t gets old. Anyhow, it's fun to pretend. Simple as that. [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Engine turns over ] You like watching me? You into that kind of thing? Pondering things, Bobby. Go ponder somewhere else. Just one question, though, before I go. The thing I was pondering. What are you gonna do when you get out? Get out? Yeah. You're bound to get out sooner or later, right? Maybe 10 years from now, 7 or 8 if you're lucky, you play the game. Good behavior. So what are you gonna do? Who the hell knows? Come on, now. Surely you've thought about this. I don't ponder things, Sheriff. Apparently, that's  your  job. You gonna be a firefighter? Or a schoolteacher? Maybe a cowboy. Excuse me? It's a simple question, Bobby. Are you gonna make something of your life, or are you gonna be a complete waste of space like those assholes you run with? You talk awful tough from behind those bars, Sheriff. I'm asking you if your life is worth saving, Bobby Dean. Are you worth saving? I don't know, Sheriff. [ Keys rattle ] Well, you better figure it out. 'Cause you just got saved. Go on. I mean it. Go on. Get processed out. Daniel Holden said it wasn't you. I know. So go on. I ain't gonna tell you again. You know, in some cultures, you'd be obliged to him now. Not in this one. Salud, gentlemen.
