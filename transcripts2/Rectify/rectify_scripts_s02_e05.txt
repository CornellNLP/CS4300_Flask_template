 Previously on Rectify... 
 I'd like to drive. 
 It might be best if we got you your license first. 
 Don't put words in my mouth. 
 Put something else in your mouth. 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 We need somebody right away. 
 I'm available whenever. 
 [Groans] 
 We need a new revenue stream, and we need it quick. 
 An high-quality wheel rims is it. 
 I just don't see it, son. 
 Oh, my...

 Janet : He got it. He got his license. 
 Oh, wow! 
 We were gonna do this when we got back. 
 Thank you, honey. 
 [Door closes] 
 Ted Sr. : What were you thinking, Daniel, besides destroying a perfectly good kitchen? 
 Honey, I know it looks bad now... 
 I'm sorry. I-I misunderstood. 
 Yeah. You did. 
 Got overly enthusiastic, I guess. 
 Well, it's done now. 
 So, we need a plan for going forward. 
 Yes, a plan. 
 You got one? 
 We're working on it, Ted. 
 Okay. 
 For now, can we settle on a few rules? 
 Sure, Ted. Rules. 
 No work before 9:00 A.M. or after 6:00, no demolition before replacement supplies are ready to install, and clean up as you go. 
 We need to keep it functional for the family. 
 Of course. 
 First things first. 
 You need to replace some of this damaged plywood. 
 You gonna do vinyl again? 
 No. That much I'm sure of. No, I got it. 
 It's fine. 
 Try that new lumber place out there on Masseyville road. 
 I'd go with you, but I'm already running late for work. 
 [Keys jingle] Take the truck. 
 You mind? 
 Uh, no, of course not. Uh... 
 Oh. 
 Well... good luck. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 He'll be all right. He's just surprised, is all. 
 Of course he is. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. I just thought it was... 
 I don't know. 
 It's gonna be great. 
 I'm very excited about everything. 
 You're a good sport, Mother. 
 I'll go get changed. 
 [Water running] 
 [Water stops] 
 Oh. 
 Still here. 
 Yeah, I was just, uh, checking out your book. 
 I see. [Chuckles] 
 I'll, uh... I'll step out so you can change. 
 That's okay, Teddy. 
 "Love may be of the seen and of the unseen, "of the present, of the absent. 
 "Consequently, a thing to be loved "is not so adapted to faith, "as a thing to be hoped for, since hope is always of the absent and the unseen." 
 Pretty intense. 
 I don't understand a lot of it, truth be told. 
 Sometimes, I just let it wash over me, see what sticks. 
 I like that. 
 I like you. 
 I like you, too, Teddy... 
 Sometimes. 
 Want to shake on it, friend? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're smart, Tawney. 
 I know I probably don't say it enough, or maybe never. 
 I am really sorry for the way I've been acting. 
 Well, today's a new day. 
 Can't get so angry, Teddy. 
 I know. 
 It'll consume you. 
 I know. 
 Then it'll consume us. 
 See? Smart. 
 I hope it's a good day for you, Tawney. 
 You too. 
 [Sighs] 
 Your light's not on. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Thank you. 
 [Register beeps] How was Peanut's labor? 
 Um, I don't know about that. I'm new. 
 [Register beeping] 
 Sorry. 
 [Register buzzing] 
 Dang thing gets stuck every once in a while, from what I hear. 
 [Register beeps] 
 You are doing just fine... "Amantha." 
 [Register beeps] 
 Ow. 
 Um, your total is $19.11. 
 [Beep] 
 Yeah, I don't know about Peanut's baby or her labor or anything, but I can find out for you if you'd like, ma'am. 
 Oh, that's sweet of you. 
 [Register beeps] 
 Did you, um, enter the P.I.N.? 
 P.I.N.'s in. 
 Will you swipe it again? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Register beeps] 
 I think I'm just gonna have to cancel it and start over. 
 Or better yet... 
 Wynn... 
 I need you, like, right away, Wynn, like, right away. 
 Sorry, y'all. 
 Register's acting loopy. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 [Sighs] 
 Please say, "I need a manager on check stand two, please, a manager." 
 But you're the only manager. 
 Swipe it again, please, Ginny. 
 Okay. 
 You doing cash for the rest? 
 Yep. 
 That's EBT she's using. 
 [Register beeps] 
 Food items only. 
 Otherwise, it'll reject the transaction. 
 EBT? 
 Oh, food stamps? 
 Assistance. 
 And it's right there on the screen. 
 How's Peanut? 
 Let me tell you the scoop... 
 Nine hours of labor, no epidural. 
 Baby's a boy named Wyatt Andrew. 
 Tips the scale at a solid 11 pounds, 5 ounces. 
 Good God! 
 Sorry. [Chuckles] It's just a... 
 A huge dang kid. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Might be a while before Peanut's back on her feet. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Thank you. 
 Oh. 
 You have a nice day. 
 Who's next? 
 Bye. 
 This felt like the best corner. 
 You know, you can see it from the road, but it's not blocking anything. 
 I figured we'd get the drive-bys and the looky-loos. 
 I was clear when we discussed this, I did not authorize you to use company funds. 
 It's not company funds, dad. It's my funds. 
 Where did you get the money to pay for all this? 
 Got a bank loan. 
 A loan? 
 Secured with what? 
 It's not your concern, dad. 
 You put up your house. 
 Yep. 
 Oh, son. 
 It's gonna be okay, dad. 
 I feel it in my bones. Change is inevitable. 
 You got to get out in front of it.

 You a browser or a buyer? 
 [Sighs] One of them. 
 Well, let me know if you decide to cross over the threshold into consumerism. 
 Actually, I am looking for something specifically. 
 Well, I like that... 
 Sometimes. 
 A Wedgewood stove. 
 How many burners? 
 Four. 
 Single broiler? Oven? 
 Yes. 
 Storage compartment/warmer or all oven below? 
 Either, I suppose. 
 How wide? 
 36 to 40 inches. 
 Good working condition, I'd imagine. 
 It's preferable, yes. 
 White, black, blue? 
 Black. 
 Nope. Don't have a Wedgewood. 
 Do you have any stoves at all? 
 Not really. 
 Used to keep a mess of them old-timey things. 
 Couldn't give 'em away. 
 Now you can't keep 'em. 
 The new south bourgeoisie. 
 You part of that group? 
 Uh, I don't think I qualify. 
 Eh, they got enough of that trickle-down money makes 'em want to buy some culture or class or... 
 Or maybe they're just fish. 
 Hell, I don't know. I just try to oblige when I can. 
 So some of that money trickles down to you. 
 Well, why the hell not? 
 I'm as much of a patriot as they are. 
 I just like old stoves. 
 [Slow-tempo music plays] 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, uh, thank you for your time. 
 You, uh, live around here? 
 I do, yes. 
 I'll send your request out to the universe and lay my ear to the cosmic rails, as it were, wait for a reply. 
 I'd appreciate that. 
 You think I'm bullshitting, don't you? 
 On the contrary. 
 Here's my number. Give me a call in a few days. 
 And I'll let you know if I got a lead. 
 Thank you. I will. 
 Get out much? 
 I'm sorry? 
 You socialize, like, at night? 
 After dark? 
 In theory. 
 Well, in theory, I'm having a party tonight. 
 My address is on the card. 
 So, if you're intrigued by the wild, weird, and wonderful... 
 Okay, can't guarantee the "wonderful." 
 But the others... 
 [Chuckles] Oh, good Lord God. 
 Anyway, you'd be more than welcome. 
 Why would you invite me to your home? 
 You want me to be honest? 
 I would, yes. 
 You're about the loneliest person I've ever seen. 
 And if you come to one of my parties, son,  you may still be lonely, but you will not be alone. 
 Or sober, if you so choose. 
 Name's Lezley, with a "Z." 
 Daniel. 
 With a "D." 
 Okay, Daniel with a "D." 
 If I don't see you tonight and you don't feel like joining the fray, then you give me a call in a few on the stove, hear? 
 Will do. 
 All due respect, madam District Attorney, have you been drinking? 
 'Cause I can't imagine a sober person even considering offering Daniel Holden a plea deal. 
 And, as I said, nothing's been offered yet, Senator. 
 But I did want you to know that I value your opinion. 
 Well, my opinion is, you've forgotten the facts of this case. 
 I've not forgotten the details of this case,  if that's what you meant. 
 I'm no longer confident that if I take this case to trial tomorrow I'd be able to find 12 people who'd be willing to put that man back on death row. 
 So, you'd let him plea out of it... 
 Because you're afraid of your prosecutorial abilities in a trial? 
 No, I'm looking at the evidence... 
 No sperm clearly tying him to the victim. 
 We know he's gonna claim forced confession. 
 What if that confession gets thrown out? 
 It won't get thrown out. 
 What if that confession gets thrown out? 
 We are down to the testimony of our two key witnesses. 
 Trey Willie stands by his original testimony. 
 That's in our favor. 
 George Melton has dropped off the radar. 
 Plea deal for time served. 
 Plus 10. 
 10 means he's out in what? 
 Six? Eight? 
 That's the kind of move that can kill a career. 
 Give me another option, Roland, one that saves both of us. 
 I'm open. 
 Okay. "Codswallop." 
 [Sighs] 
 Uh, codswallop. 
 Uh, a fish commonly abbreviated to "COD." 
 Wrong. And you're down to 87 points. 
 It means "nonsense." 
 Nonsense? 
 As in, "Niles is incessantly jabbering codswallop." 
 Niles? 
 Niles. 
 Incessantly jabbering. 
 You almost get a point back for that one, Mother. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey. I'm at 92. 
 And he's down to 87. You want to scrape or read? 
 Give me that. 
 All right. Uh, "proscenium." 
 That's the arch in the theater. 
 Apron of the stage. 
 You got to pick harder words, brother. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Laughs] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Amantha. 
 Wow. This is really, uh... 
 Wow. 
 You want to help, honey? 
 Oh, no. I just stopped by to do laundry. 
 Ran out of quarters. 
 Is that okay? 
 Of course. 
 Can't wait to see how it turns out. 
 It's, uh, postmodern. 
 Deconstructionist. 
 It speaks with its absence. 
 [Laughs] 
 Y'all see in the paper? 
 Gaines died. 
 You know who, uh, Rutherford Gaines was, Jared? 
 Uh, wasn't he your lawyer? 
 Young man knows more than he lets on. 
 What else do you know, Jared? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know what else you know? 
 No. 
 It's a family disease. 
 How did Gaines die? 
 Regret or cancer. I forget. 
 He lived a long life, didn't he? 
 May we all. 
 I'm gonna go get some sandpaper. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. 
 
 
 
 [Sighs] 
 So, when did the wrecking ball hit the kitchen? 
 You at all worried that none of you know what you're doing? 
 Probably. 
 You look tired, sweetheart. 
 You been packing up your place? 
 [Sighs] 
 No, Mother. I got a job. 
 Really? In Atlanta? 
 No, in Paulie. 
 What? 
 Thrifty Town. 
 Seriously, where? 
 They hardly ever hire. 
 But as luck would have it, I walked in at just the right time. 
 Peanut went out on maternity leave. 
 I'm afraid I don't entirely understand, Amantha. 
 You are working for someone named Peanut? 
 No, Mother. I am working because of Peanut. 
 She's recovering. 
 Why, honey? 
 As I understand it, you need some time after you deliver a child, especially an 11-pounder like Wyatt Andrew. 
 No, I mean why did you take a job at Thrifty Town? 
 Oh, well, let's see. I need money. 
 I think that's about it. You have any stain stick? 
 Uh, I have pre-wash. 
 That should do it. 
 Thanks. 
 [Dryer whirring] 
 Hard to believe we used to park cars in here. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yes, we are what we don't throw away. 
 Teddy bears and barbells. 
 [Chuckles] Your old bike. 
 The tank. 
 You rode that thing everywhere. 
 People thought I was crazy, riding a bike to the grocery store when I could drive a perfectly good car. 
 Communist. 
 Your daddy put these baskets on. 
 No offense, but you always reminded me of the wicked witch when you rode this. 
 How could I possibly be offended? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Why did you stop riding it? 
 I don't think we need to tell sad stories. 
 Life's too short. 
 That's exactly why we have to tell them. 
 It's about me, isn't it? 
 Honey, I don't want to tell this. 
 Please, mama, I can't fill in the gaps on my own. 
 I need to hear. 
 It was in 1995. 
 July the 10th. 
 I'd bought a new dress to wear... 
 Yellow flowers, like a summer picnic dress. 
 I-I grabbed it right before the store closed that day. 
 I have no idea why I bought that dress. 
 It was perverse. 
 And when the time came to go, I just... 
 [Voice breaking] I-I just couldn't do it. 
 Mr. Gaines said it was a formality, that the execution would be stayed again, but... 
 Anyway, I just kept walking up and down the stairs, checking the clock. 
 Finally, I-I came out here. I saw my bike. 
 Your dad heard the garage open and came out and asked me what was I doing. 
 I said, "I'm... I'm gonna take a ride." 
 "No, you're not." "Yes, I am." 
 "Janet, don't make me get in the car and follow you." 
 [Chuckles] I said, "let me be." 
 And he did. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Rode down the street... And I rode through town, past the water tower, past the satellites, in that ridiculous yellow dress. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I rode for I don't know how long, until I-I thought midnight had passed. 
 When I stopped, I realized that I'd run over a nail and the back tire was flat. 
 [Sighs] I turned around, rode it the whole way home that way. 
 I remember exactly where I was standing when your dad told me that they'd given you another stay... Right by the front door, by that old brass umbrella stand with the swan on it. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I remember he helped me to bed. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I threw out that dress. [Chuckles] 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Sighs] 
 I, uh, think I'm gonna go make myself a sandwich. 
 Would you like one? 
 No, thank you. 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Car door opens] 
 Who are you? 
 I'm not sure. 
 You look familiar. 
 If you figure it out, will you let me know? 
 God, I'm glad you're here. 
 Amantha : Kind of blew Mom's mind. 
 Was that the point of getting a job at... 
 Where, again? 
 Thrifty Town, Jon. 
 I am working at Thrifty Town because I literally cannot afford to move to Atlanta, and Melvin is unyielding on any refunds of last month's rent and deposit. 
 Well, he wants to keep you here forever. 
 [Chuckles] He's sweet. 
 He's my competition. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Actually, the idea of having something to show up for is a relief, to think of something other than... 
 Yourself? 
 I cannot believe you just said that. 
 But maybe. 
 [Clears throat] Speaking of jobs... 
 I got an interesting call from William. 
 William from Justice Row? 
 Jon : He called me at the airport. 
 He said Peter Mullen's leaving and they need a replacement. 
 And they're asking you? 
 They're asking me. 
 How long do you have to think about it? 
 He wants me to call him on my way to Varner before Eddyville on Wednesday and Riverbend on Friday. 
 Death row tour? 
 Should we print t-shirts? 
 Hmm. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I just need a change, you know? 
 Would you consider Boston? 
 Do I have to answer right now? 
 Think about it? 
 Okay. 
 But first, we have some stuff that we really need to talk about. 
 Stuff? 
 Yeah. 
 It's super-secret, and... 
 I'm not really sure we should even be out here talking about it, because we don't know who might be listening in. 
 May have hidden microphones in the vents. 
 Microphones. 
 Wow. 
 Do you think it... 
 Do you think it would be better in the bedroom? 
 Maybe. 
 We should probably check. 
 I'll go that way. You go that way. 
 [Humming] 
 [Brushing] 
 Got the display all set up today. 
 Even had a couple folks pop in after lunch to take a look around. 
 Only a matter of time now, I know it. 
 That's great. 
 It is, right? 
 Yeah, it really is. 
 Uh-oh. 
 You got the worried eyebrows. 
 It's nothing. 
 Which means it's something. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, it's just... 
 I want to go to school. 
 School. 
 I know it's kind of out of the blue. 
 I just... 
 What kind of school? 
 College. 
 I want to take classes... 
 Night classes, I guess. 
 Want to get my degree, eventually. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 So, you've been thinking about this for a while. 
 A little while, yeah. 
 How come you haven't said anything? 
 I don't know. 
 Teddy, I guess... 
 [Sighs] 
 My period's late. 
 Well, you're just full of surprises tonight. 
 I'm not trying to be. 
 You've been late before. 
 I know. 
 This feels different. 
 Different how? 
 I don't know. More... real, I guess. 
 Okay. 
 Well... 
 Should I go get one of those tests from the drug store? 
 I guess we should. 
 Okay. Should I go right now? 
 We can wait till tomorrow. 
 [Sighs] 
 Just us chickens? 
 Just us chickens. 
 You didn't handle that well this morning. 
 He's a grown man, Janet. 
 He's a damaged one, Ted. 
 I know that, but he can't just do things and not face some responsibility for it. 
 It seems to me that he's had more than his fair share of being held responsible. 
 I realize that. 
 You don't know how hard this is on him. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's tough on everyone, even me. 
 Why don't you tell me all about how you've suffered? 
 You're not listening. No, you're not listening. 
 You won't ever speak to him again the way you spoke to him this morning. 
 I won't allow it. 
 You won't allow it? 
 He won't be treated like that in his own home. 
 Which is my home, too. 
 It was his first. 
 I'm going to bed. 
 [Loud music plays in distance]

 [Chuckles] 
 Lion : It was misguided at best. 
 Karen : I think you're wrong, Lionel. 
 I think what they were trying to do is positive, man. 
 It was doomed from the start. 
 Occupy some dickhead's Cadillac would have worked better. 
 Yeah, like the Donalds' Eldorado. 
 [Chuckles] 
 And this one! Chime in. 
 Occupy movement. Pinpoint its failure. 
 Occupy what? 
 Exactly. 
 All I know is revolution ain't never been fomented by poor people sitting on their ass in tents. 
 Uh, the Russian revolution was started by peasants. 
 Peasants, huh? 
 I don't know if they lived in tents, though. 
 Tolstoy here talking about the Russian revolution like he was there. 
 You're gonna need this, friend. 
 I know you? 
 I don't think so. 
 You sure? 
 Leave him alone, Lionel. 
 Dude looks familiar. 
 Enjoy your night. 
 Yeah, that's my buddy Dan with a "D"! 
 Give me a hand with this thing. Grab the end of it. 
 Grab it. 
 I got it from an old queen in Ansley Park, and it was not easy to talk him out of. 
 Right in there. 
 Ooh. 
 Set it down right there. Thank you. 
 Little squirrely one with a rattail giving you sh1t? 
 It's ok. 
 Oh, brother, please. 
 Lionel gets here two hours early just to claim a spot on that old chair. 
 He ain't got nothing else, except a two-inch pee-pee. [Chuckles] 
 Let me get us a shot of something. 
 Hey, hey, now. 
 Hold on, now, runaway train. Where you headed? 
 [Stammers] Home. I... 
 Not allowed. Not yet. 
 You came here for a reason. 
 You best ride that out. 
 What if I don't know the reason? 
 Well, reason's known, yet also for you to discover. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 But here, hook this around your belt loop. 
 For the next hour, you and me gonna stay tethered, remain in a radius of each other, like orbiting planets. 
 I-I don't think so. 
 What are you afraid of? 
 I'd just prefer not to be... 
 Tied to anything. 
 You may have a point there. 
 Okay, we'll, uh, make the radius implied. 
 Implied? 
 Yes. 
 Implied radius. No cord. 
 One hour. I'll just set the kitchen timer. 
 For that hour... 
 Here is your great mandate from the mouth of the great Lezley, who knows not a hell of a lot... 
 Act as if. 
 As if what? 
 As if you belong here, Daniel, with us, your fellow travelers. 
 Come on, buddy. You come this far.

 What's your game, Lezley? 
 You already know what to do, Daniel. 
 Just got to remember it.
