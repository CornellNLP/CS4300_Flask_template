 Previously on Rectify... 
 My period's late. 
 [Groans] 
 I was passed out from the choke hold he put on me. 
 You think I'd let him pull my pants down if I'd have been awake? 
 No, no. Of course not. 
 If you tell anybody about this, Carl... I swear to God. 
 So, you'd let him plea out of it... 
 Give me another option, Roland, one that saves both of us. 
 For later on. 
 Are they shrooms? 
 You already know what to do, Daniel. 
 Just got to remember it. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 [Door opens] 
 Boy : Mom, what's for lunch? I'm hungry. 
 Marcy : Honey, don't come out here. 
 I told you... Stay in your room. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh. 
 Sorry. 
 I'm sorry. [Chuckles] 
 I'm not used to knocking on my own door. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] That's okay. 
 [Dog panting] 
 [Liquid pouring] 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Did I hear a child's voice? 
 His dad just dropped him by. 
 I get him on weekends. 
 [Dog whines] 
 Is Monarch bothering you? 
 No. He's... he's... he's fine. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Hmm. 
 So, you know, uh, Lezley? 
 Everybody knows Lezley... 
 Whether they want to admit it or not. 
 You staying over there now? 
 No. I... 
 I just went over there the other night and... 
 Never left. 
 I used to go there a lot when I was younger. 
 It's like a rite of passage. 
 So that's what that was. 
 Mm. 
 You can finish your beer, Daniel. 
 Take as long as you like. 
 The door, it'll lock behind you. 
 I'll just take it with me. 
 It's... 
 Daniel. 
 Yes? 
 Be careful. 
 [Sighs] 
 Was it me, or could it have been anybody last night? 
 Sometimes... 
 I do things I don't have a good answer for. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I understand. 
 [Air hissing] 
 Daniel Holden. 
 [Hissing stops] 
 As free as the wind blows. 
 Feels real, don't it? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Fixing to warm up. 
 It's good for catfish. 
 [Keys jingling] 
 [Engine turns over] 
 I don't think I need to know how many weeks it was, Teddy. 
 I was there with you. 
 Oh, I-I know. I just... 
 I just thought it was interesting you could pee on a stick now, and they'd tell you all that. That's all. 
 I mean, one day it'll be able to tell you if it's a boy or girl, you know? 
 I don't think I want to know all that at once. 
 It's been three minutes. 
 I can't look. 
 [Sighs, chuckles] 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 You're pregnant. 
 Really? 
 Says more than five weeks. 
 Oh, my God! [Inhales deeply] 
 Can I say this right now? 
 What? 
 You got a bun in the oven right there. 
 No. You can't say that. 
 All right. How about this? 
 How about... How about "we're pregnant"? 
 No. 
 [Sighs] 
 How about... 
 "You're pregnant," Tawney Talbot? 
 You're pregnant. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] I guess I am. 
 ♪ Ain't no lie, can't deny ♪ 
♪ Ain't no lie, can't deny ♪ 
♪ Ain't no lie, can't deny ♪ 
♪ Ain't no lie ♪ 
 Can't deny. 
 [Both laugh] 
 [Smooches] 
 I prayed about this. 
 You did? 
 I just prayed that God's will be done, you know? 
 And that's all I knew to do... His will be done. 
 And you're pregnant. 
 [Chuckles] 
 By God, you're pregnant. 
 [Laughs] 
 I am, Teddy. [Chuckles] 
 With your baby. 
 Teddy? 
 Yeah, Tawney? 
 It's still early. 
 I know. I know. 
 Can we keep it a secret? 
 Enjoy it for a little while, just you and me? 
 You ain't gonna believe it. 
 Another one fell. 
 Another one? 
 Different tree. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I lost track of time. 
 Three days, Daniel. 
 I thought I left you a message. 
 That was Thursday morning. 
 Right. 
 Ted and I had to drive around last night looking for you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I-I almost called the sheriff. 
 I really didn't want to do that. 
 I know you're not a teenager, Daniel, but... 
 But you're also not... 
 Normal. 
 Your life hasn't been normal, so how could you expect to be? 
 Like, I just want to know where you are. 
 All right, sweetheart? 
 Daniel : Of course. 
 I-I have to go. 
 I have to get ready. 
 For what? 
 I thought I would go to Mr. Gaines' funeral. 
 That's... 
 Thoughtful. 
 Um... 
 I'll do some work when I get back. 
 So, you're coming home, then, and staying for a while? 
 I plan to, yes. 
 I need to borrow some... Some money for some things. 
 How much? 
 $50 will be okay. 
 I'll pay you back when I get a job. 
 I'm not worried. 
 And once I start working, I-I-I might even buy an old beater truck or... 
 I could see you in one of those. 
 Yeah. 
 How... how are you gonna get there? 
 Oh, uh... 
 I thought I'd walk. 
 Take the car. 
 I don't want to keep taking your car, Mother. 
 I don't want you to walk, Daniel. 
 Please. 
 Be careful. 
 [Sighs] 
 Burgdorf : Rutherford was a good friend. 
 Had a sharp mind. 
 He played a spirited game of bridge. 
 Wasn't much on the golf course. 
 He just kind of did that out of obligation or penance. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I know that he was a great father. 
 We'll miss him. 
 [Indistinct whispering] 
 [Man clears throat] 
 Holy mother of God. 
 I-I'm not sure if it's appropriate for... 
 For me to say something or not. 
 The irony of it doesn't escape me, of course. 
 Anyway, uh... 
 Mr. Gaines used to send me books when I was away. 
 Three books on the French revolution alone. 
 He liked revolutions, I guess, especially failed ones. 
 I discovered a theme running through those books... 
 That men will see what they want to see and believe what they want to believe and fight to the death for those beliefs, no matter how misguided or hopeless. 
 Oftentimes I would dream on these events, of the crowds taking the streets, taking the squares, and the contagion of menacing fear, and mercy be damned. 
 And occasionally, I would... 
 I would see Mr. Gaines, away from the crowd. 
 Catch his eye and... 
 Understand just how difficult it is for two people to come together in the face of such intoxicating lunacy. 
 [Sighs] Truth is, I didn't know Mr. Gaines. 
 Not really. 
 His notes that accompanied the books were never personal. 
 They just talked of the subject matter at hand. 
 At first I didn't care if he sent them or not. 
 I... 
 But I read them. 
 And he kept sending them. 
 For 19 years. 
 Like I said, I... 
 I don't know why I'm here exactly. 
 I suppose it might reason that... 
 I dressed up for him because on more than one occasion... 
 He dressed up for me. 
 Thank you. 
 [Man speaking indistinctly] 
 Carl : What the hell was that about? 
 Gall. Pure gall. 
 So, you think this plea deal is gonna happen? 
 I think she wants it to happen. 
 Get it out of her hair. 
 I never should have backed that bitch in the first place. 
 You think he'll take it? 
 Holden? sh1t. 
 Who knows what he'll do? 
 He let a man piss on him. 
 Where is George goddamn Melton, Carl? 
 Are you sure you want to find him? 
 But you still see Holden as a threat. 
 To who? 
 The community. 
 I wouldn't want to live next to him. 
 Would you? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 You keeping secrets from me, Carl? 
 Wildflowers and coffee. 
 Jesus. 
 Holden's creative. I'll give him that. 
 Problem is, Ted Jr. won't press charges. 
 Well, then we just got to talk some sense into that boy. 
 You got two choke-outs and two sexual assaults. 
 You think that's a coincidence? 
 That's why I brought it up. 
 It's modus operandi, Carl. 
 It's a gift from the gods. 
 It'll nip this plea-deal nonsense in the bud. 
 I discussed the legal side with Ted Jr. 
 Said he doesn't want the embarrassment of it. 
 Felt pretty strong about it, too. 
 I can't help his little feelings. 
 The die was cast when Holden shoved coffee beans up his ass. 
 Hey. Refill, Senator? 
 What happened to calling me "sweetie"? 
 Refill, sweetie? 
 Attagirl. 
 [Liquid pouring] 
 Mm-mm. 
 It was grounds, Roland. 
 What? 
 Not beans. Grounds. 
 And Teddy said there wasn't actual penetration. 
 I don't give a good God damn. 
 You tell me any backwoods prosecutor couldn't convince a jury that that was the intent. 
 He damn sure wasn't making sand castles back there. 
 We just got to get Junior on the record. 
 He ain't gonna like this. 
 Not one bit. 
 Well, this is bigger than him, Carl. 
 This is bigger than all of us. 
 You did the right thing telling me this. 
 Don't go soft on me now. 
 $60 on an $8 meal? 
 [Cash register dings] 
 You up for a little visit later? 
 Got my son tonight, Senator. 
 You're messing with an old man's heart. 
 That's why you keep coming back for more. 
 [Rock music plays] 
 [Laughs] 
 Stop laughing. 
 Just keep one foot in front of the other. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Jon. 
 Jon. 
 Okay. [Laughs] 
 You've escaped death once again. 
 It's in the family DNA. [Laughs] 
 Holdens are invincible, huh? 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Superheroes. 
 Deejay : Men, bring your ladies close. 
 It's time for a couples dance. 
 I like you, Jon Stern. 
 Should we go steady? 
 Why don't you shut up and kiss me? 
 In front of all of Paulie? 
 I don't care who sees us anymore. 
 ♪ Some say love's a dream ♪ 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughs] 
 I can't believe you're about to leave. 
 For a few days. 
 Death row beckons? 
 I'll be back. 
 And then you'll leave again. 
 Doesn't have to be this way. 
 Do I at least get a parting gift? 
 Darla : Excuse me. 
 First your brother shows up at Mr. Gaines' funeral rambling about God knows what, and now here you are acting like... 
 I know you have to live your life. 
 I understand that. 
 I know it's not your fault, the position you're in. 
 But could you go do it somewhere else, please? 
 So that we don't have to think about Hanna and what happened to her that night? 
 How old were you then? 
 5? 
 Jon, please. 
 No. Really. 
 8? 
 I was old enough. 
 Old enough. For what? 
 To listen to what your parents told you and believe it because they said it was true? 
 Afraid to think for yourself. 
 Scared to look at all the facts. 
 And for what? 
 So you'd never have to admit to yourself that you might be wrong. 
 Could you go do that somewhere else? 
 Please. 
 Good night. 
 And good luck. 
 Wow. 
 Daniel was rambling at Gaines' funeral? 
 I don't know. [Sighs] 
 And here we are, living it up at the skating rink. 
 Not a care in the damn world. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 We should have known better. 
 I should have known better. 
 It's okay, Jon. 
 I mean, screw her and the minivan she came in. 
 It's not her we should be worried about. 
 [Sighs] 
 That's right. 
 Almost forgot for a second. 
 [Slurred] Blue pill, white pill. 
 Blue pill, white pill. 
 Blue pill, white pill. 
 Blue pill, white pill. 
 Blue pill, white pill. 
 Charlie : Daniel? 
 My name's Charlie. 
 Did you call for me? 
 I didn't call for you. 
 I'm the chaplain. 
 Praise God. 
 What? 
 Well... 
 I'm here if you want to talk. 
 I don't want to talk. 
 You mind if I just sit here, then? 
 I don't care what you do. 
 Charlie the chaplain. 
 Charlie Chaplain. [Chaplin] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Took you long enough. 
 I'm not as sharp as I used to be. 
 Does that work better for you... 
 Not being as sharp as you used to be? 
 Shut up, Charlie Chaplain. 
 I'm not making a point. 
 Just asking. 
 I liked you better in the silent era. 
 [Chuckles] 
 This kitchen is long overdue for a remodel. 
 I know Mom's psyched. 
 You're a sensitive person, Jared. 
 It's a good trait. 
 [Grunts] 
 Mom said that the sheriff's department returned some of my possessions from the, um... 
 My walkman and other things. 
 I found the other items, but I-I didn't find my walkman. 
 [Horn honks] 
 I'm sure it'll turn up. 
 Well, that'll be Lezley with a "Z." 
 Better go. 
 
 
 
 Daniel. 
 Yes, Jared? 
 Well... 
 Uh, d... You know what today is, right? 
 The day of our dear mother's birth. 
 2:00 is the party. 
 I'll be there. 
 Hanna was just a baby back then. 
 I didn't think of her that way at the time... 
 I guess 'cause we were all just babies. 
 It's good to be curious about things, Jared... 
 Especially when those things are somehow taboo. 
 You just got to be... 
 Careful. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Give me the money. 
 Now, you get the microwave and the Dinty Moore and let me do the talking. 
 [Knocking] 
 Tater, it's Lezley. 
 Tater : Who? 
 Lezley! 
 Tater : Hold on a minute! 
 I got to find my pants. 
 I second that motion. 
 Huh?! 
 Wh... put your pants on! 
 You brought my liquor, gypsy man. 
 Johnnie Walker no less, Tater. 
 Uh-huh. 
 All right. What else? 
 A slightly used microwave oven. 
 A case of Dinty Moore. 
 And $50 cash. 
 $100 cash. 
 $60. 
 $75. 
 $70? 
 Okay. Deal. 
 Thank you. 
 You owe me $20. 
 Ahh. 
 What are you looking at? 
 Go get the Dolly. 
 This son of a bitch is gonna be heavy. 
 I-I don't want to take this man's stuff. 
 You feeling guilty? 
 It's kind of a constant refrain with you, ain't it? 
 You might ought to look into that. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, this stove ain't been used since Tater's wife died eight years ago. 
 Stove ain't nothing more than a memory to him now, really. 
 Might as well keep it up in his head where memories belong. 
 Have a microwave in the kitchen he can actually use. 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know what? 
 I don't know what to do. 
 That's 'cause you're stuck, Daniel. 
 Surprised you ain't dead. 
 You're full of sh1t, Lezley. 
 At least I'm okay with it. 
 You okay with what you are? 
 Now either go get the Dolly or pry that bottle of scotch from Tater's mitts. 
 I don't give a sh1t either way. 
 Mom, please let me frost the cake. 
 I can do it. 
 I know you can, but you've already baked your own birthday cake. 
 You shouldn't have to frost it. Right, dad? 
 It's Mom's birthday. 
 I guess she can do what she wants. 
 Want me to get the chairs out of the garage? 
 Thank you, Ted. 
 [Door opens] 
 What's going on with you and dad? 
 You need to do a crumb coat first. 
 Okay. 
 I don't know what that is. 
 It's just easier if I do it. 
 No, no. Mom. 
 Tell me. 
 You put a light layer on first and then let it sit. 
 Okay. Cool. 
 Amantha : [Sighs] 
 Here we go. 
 Jon : Yep. 
 Did you just say "yep"? 
 Yep. 
 [Laughs] 
 To state the obvious, this is Mom's first birthday ever with all of her children. 
 And I'm going to make a promise in front of you and all these balloons that I'm going to be nice to everyone. 
 Including Ted Jr.? 
 Pray for me. 
 ♪ It is getting hot, dear ♪ 
♪ Did I ever love you? ♪ 
♪ Think about it ♪ 
 Hey. 
 Mom in the kitchen? 
 Where else? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Would you? 
 I'm on it. 
 Thank you. 
 Happy Birthday, Mom. 
 Oh, thank you, sweetheart. 
 Did you bring the... 
 I did. [Laughs] 
 Should I put it up top? 
 Oh, the ham is in there. 
 Got it. 
 I'm not even gonna ask how you got her to let you frost her own birthday cake. 
 A first. 
 Does it look okay? 
 It looks like, um... 
 You've never done it before. 
 Thanks a lot, sister. 
 Janet : [Laughs] 
 Hey. 
 Did you get the stuff? 
 Jon's got everything in the other room. 
 Okay. I'm gonna go. 
 Yeah. Go. 
 Okay. 
 I'm going. I'm going. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is Daniel here? 
 Uh, Jared said he went off with a friend. 
 That's good. 
 But he knows. 
 He'll be back. 
 Of course, Mom. 
 Ted Jr. : Happy Birthday! 
 Amantha : Hey, y'all. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Tawney. 
 Hi. 
 Hey, Teddy. 
 Hi, Amantha. 
 Tawney, thank you. They're lovely. 
 Oh, I'm glad you like them. 
 Teddy. 
 Got a minute? 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Here. 
 Oh, I need to finish the glaze. 
 Nope. 
 It's your birthday, Mom. 
 You are officially off duty. 
 Uh, but the beans... 
 Tawney. 
 I-I'll do the beans, Janet. 
 Mother, you are just gonna have to sit down and have a glass of wine and enjoy the delightful company of your charming family. 
 I should set the table. 
 We got it, Mom. 
 Drink. Be merry. 
 Ted Jr. : Need a boost there, buddy? 
 Jared : I can reach it. 
 Look at you getting all tall on us, Jared. 
 Oh. 
 Y'all didn't have to go to all this fuss. 
 Ted Sr. : No fuss. 
 Just thought we'd do a little extra this year, considering. 
 Happy Birthday, Mom. 
 Thank you, Teddy. 
 It'd be a lot better if you weren't in here seeing them do this. 
 [Sighs] 
 Teddy. 
 You all right? 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 You ain't said nothing smart aleck to me yet. 
 Don't push your luck. 
 ♪ He's the one ♪ 
 Thirsty? 
 Sure. 
 [Laughs] 
 Good to see you guys finally came out of the closet. 
 Mazel Tov. 
 Is that appropriate? 
 Thank you, Teddy. 
 And, yes, Tawney, "mazel tov" is appropriate. 
 Good deal, brother. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Where you gonna travel to? 
 Jon : Also went to Vancouver. 
 What do you think, Mom? 
 Maybe we should go ahead and eat? 
 It's been almost an hour. [Sighs] 
 We can make a plate for him for when he gets here. 
 Maybe wait a little bit longer? 
 Okay. 
 Ted Jr. : Organic. 
 Is that what you're gonna start buying now? 
 Organic stuff? 
 Ted Jr. : Oh, my goodness. That was good, good, good. 
 Janet : Thank you. 
 Everything was wonderful. 
 Mom, thank you. 
 Amantha : Delicious. 
 Ted Sr. : Everything was wonderful. 
 Tawney : I can't eat another bite. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm stuffed. [Chuckles] 
 Jon : Potatoes are awesome. 
 Thanks. Can't stop eating them. 
 [Glass clinks] 
 I think everyone can agree that father time is working in reverse on my beautiful wife. 
 Oh, now. 
 Happy Birthday, sweetheart. 
 Thank you, Ted. 
 Happy Birthday, Mom. 
 Mom, I also just want to say how much you mean to me and Tawney, and... and I just hope that you know that anything... 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Door opens] 
 Come on in. 
 [Door closes] 
 Happy Birthday, Mother. 
 I'm so sorry I'm late. 
 I... It's okay. 
 You're just in time for cake. 
 Ted Sr. : Who's your friend, Daniel? 
 This is, um... 
 Lezley. With a "Z." 
 Hello. 
 Janet : How do you do? 
 He was helping me, um, find your present. 
 One of my more difficult rummages. 
 Well, thank you for your efforts. 
 Oh, it was well worth the challenge, considering the circumstances of this special occasion. 
 Shall we go get her? 
 Yes. 
 I'll be right back. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, Mother. 
 Come on through. 
 It's a Wedgewood, like we talked about. 
 Oh. 
 R-right, like the... the photo you showed me... a-a Wedgewood. 
 I-I thought it was what you wanted. 
 Well, I-I thought maybe down the line, but it's lovely, Daniel. 
 Does it work? 
 I was assured when it was last used, there was no issue. 
 Some refinishing might be appropriate. 
 But you got to run a gas line in. 
 Got a gas main line in? 
 No. It... it's all electric. 
 That won't be cheap. 
 It can be done, Teddy. 
 Oh, yeah. Sure. I mean, you know. 
 Of course, you just got to rip up the electric stove top there, pull the ovens out of the wall, you know, that sort of thing. 
 But... anything's possible. 
 Jon : It's a nice gift, Daniel. 
 Very thoughtful. 
 It sure is. 
 But w-we don't need to decide right now. 
 We can put it in the garage for later. 
 If it was me, I'd do it right now, while you're in the middle of a demo. 
 I mean, it's not much to take this out, really. 
 And you have room to run the gas line in here. 
 Up here, cabinets. 
 Down here, drawers, what have you. 
 Wedgewood [Clicks tongue] right there. 
 I always liked gas stoves. 
 Had one growing up. 
 I think they make things taste just a little better. 
 If that's possible with your mother's cooking. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm just saying if it was me. 
 Right now... 
 Let's have some cake. 
 [Chuckles] Come on, Daniel. 
 I'm sorry I said that you were... 
 Full of sh1t. 
 Yes. 
 You taking it back? 
 No. 
 [Laughs] 
 I believe forces brought you out to my establishment in search of a stove for your mama's birthday. 
 Same forces will tell you where to go next if you listen. 
 Sometimes it's hard to hear. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, we usually hear better when we're in pain. 
 But, damn, if you ain't got a high threshold. 
 See you around the fringes, buddy. 
 [Truck door closes] 
 So, where to now, Lezley? 
 Might ought to go look behind you. 
 I'm afraid to. 
 Yeah. 
 I would be, too. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Ted Jr. : I mean, it's a throwaway society. 
 That's true. 
 I mean, we buy stuff, and then we throw it away. 
 I mean, why not lease it and then give it back when we're done, you know? 
 Let them haul it off to the landfill. 
 Good point. 
 Damn right. 
 [Door closes] 
 Hello, Tawney. 
 Hello, Daniel. 
 You look restful. 
 I feel restful. 
 Thank you. 
 How are you? 
 How are you feeling? 
 Well, I'm... 
 I'm feeling a lot of things, but, uh, I wouldn't say restful is one of them. 
 Well... 
 Thank you, Tawney, for, uh... for reaching out to me when you did. 
 I hope I did the right thing, Daniel. 
 I think you did. 
 You made me feel, Tawney. 
 Really feel, you know? 
 Yes. 
 For the first time in a long time. 
 That's a big part of what makes us human, isn't it? 
 I think so. 
 I think it... 
 Deepens us. 
 I've been deepened. 
 Ted Jr. : I think I'm gonna take me some of that cake home. 
 We're gonna have to scoot here in a minute. 
 See what Tawn... 
 Hey, everybody. 
 I... got an announcement to make. 
 Uh... 
 H-hey, uh, baby, would you come here? 
 Come here, baby. 
 Mom, we got one more present for you. 
 We're pregnant. [Laughs] 
 What?! Oh, my gosh! 
 Surprise! 
 Tawney! 
 Happy Birthday! 
 Oh! 
 That's good news, son. 
 Aw, thanks, dad. 
 I appreciate it. 
 I'm happy for you both. 
 Oh, that's just wonderful. 
 I know I wasn't supposed to say anything, you know, but I just... I just couldn't wait. 
 Just couldn't wait. [Laughs] 
 Oh, boy. 
 There's a bun in that oven, buddy. 
 [Laughs] Congratulations, Teddy. 
 Thanks, Jon. 
 Congratulations. 
 Aww, thank you, Amantha. Appreciate it. 
 Jon and I have an announcement, too. 
 [Laughter] 
 Janet : Oh. 
 Ohh. We're not pregnant. 
 [Laughter] 
 Yet. 
 We're just as happy as can be about the whole thing. 
 Charlie : On Tuesday, I go to this hospice in Macon. 
 [Slurred] You're a Saint, Charlie. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well... 
 They're just people dying. 
 Happens every day. 
 Am I dying? 
 Do you want to die, Daniel? 
 My sister keeps interfering. 
 You're mumbling. 
 She's a little busybody, all grown up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Anyway... 
 I play music for them.
