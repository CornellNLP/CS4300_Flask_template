 (sirens wailing in distance) 
 (explosions in distance) 
 (alarm beeping) 
 (alarm stops) 
 (gunfire in distance) 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 (gunfire continues) 
 Man : You're off to a good start. 
 (gunfire continues over TV) 
 Jason, why don't you turn that off now? 
 Come on, come get some breakfast. 
 Jason : All right, let me... 
 That's enough carnage for 7:00 a.m. 
 All right, let me save it. 
 Hold on. 
 Uh, oh, I'll save it for you. 
 Jason : Well... 
 Dad... come on. 
 (laughs) Come on, let's go. 
 Hey, don't act like you got some big problem with my game. 
 You play it, too. Okay. 
 Aah! 
 Oh, come on! 
 Breakfast. 
 Oh. 
 The discovery of hypocrisy. 
 Bitter moment in any young revolutionary's life. 
 Well, kid's got a point, but, uh, when he's not telling me how much I suck at this game, he actually sometimes tells me something about his life. 
 Right. 
 Hey, you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 'Cause you've been just going nonstop since you got back from Iran. 
 Oh, I'm a little jetlagged still, but I'm good. 
 I'm fine. 
 Promise. 
 I'm just saying, going back to school is gonna be a big adjustment after lying around here all day, playing video games. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, you should know, dropout. 
 Oh, burn! 
 Ooh! 
 Good comeback, Padawan. 
 Alison : You know that if you get kicked out of two schools in a row, you have to go to military school, right? 
 It's, like, the law. 
 Hey, I could handle military school. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Okay, wait. What about, uh, home-schooling, pal? 
 Uh, I'll stick with public school. 
 Oh, come on. Just think of it. You and me studying all these great books, spending hours having philosophical discussions. 
 Mm. Shoot me now. 
 Jason. 
 Jason : What did I say? 
 Well, I'm-I'm glad that you're on board with public school, because that is where you're going. 
 Oh, we have that-that, uh, orientation meeting at 11:00, okay? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Listen, um, I cleared my schedule out this morning. 
 You want to take the time off? Maybe we can go... 
 I can't. I've got meetings. 
 Then I've got meetings after those meetings, so I got to go. 
 Bye, guys. 
 Alison : Bye, Mom. 
 Love you. 
 Stevie : Bye, Mom. Love you. 
 Bye. Ow. 
 Nice sensitivity, dumb-ass. 
 What...? Dad! 
 Okay, cut it out, both of you. 
 Nadine :  The desk officer is waiting to brief you  on your first meeting. 
 Ecuador? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 And Matt and Daisy are here to have a word with you this morning. 
 Yes, I'm getting that. 
 Ma'am, we need to prep you for  Face The Nation. 
 Can't this morning. 
 I got a thing at my son's school. 
 Well, you've been at the center of everything that's happened. 
 Unearthing Director Munsey's plot, thwarting the coup in Iran. 
 The White House wants you front and center to reassure the public that everything is okay. 
 Well, is it? News to me. 
 This... 
 The point is, ma'am, I mean, if there's a hero in this story, it's you. 
 What did you just say? 
 Because what I thought you said is that I'm the hero of this story? 
 Excuse me, ma'am. Daisy didn't mean to imply... 
 Excuse me, Nadine. 
 See, what's confusing is how you could possibly say something like that, just days after you attended Fred Cole's funeral. 
 Man who literally threw himself in front of bullets to save me. 
 Which is the very definition of heroism. 
 You come at me with this win-the-cycle crap again, it'll be the last time you do. 
 You understand? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Why is there a nurse in my waiting area? 
 Oh, she's here to follow up on the exam you received at Landstuhl. 
 You kept rescheduling, so I had someone from Walter Reed sent over. 
 I had said I would go to my own doctor when I had the time. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 They needed a follow-up ASAP, ma'am. 
 It's literally doctor's orders. 
 Et tu, Blake? 
 Nurse :  You're healing well, Madam Secretary. 
 Stitches should be ready to come out in a few days. 
 Fantastic. 
 Are you having any pain, ma'am? 
 Nope. None. 
 Then, um, I just need to draw your blood. 
 Well, I'm on a tight schedule. 
 I hope you don't mind if I multitask. 
 So, what does the CEO of one of America's biggest oil companies want from a peon like the Secretary of State? 
 Chip Harding is here because he believes you should be doing more to help Ashmont Petroleum secure drilling rights in Ecuador, as opposed to the Chinese. 
 Elizabeth : But the proposed area of the Amazon is highly sensitive, which is what our desk officer for the region is here to discuss. 
 It's Laura, right? 
 (clears throat) Uh, yes, ma'am. 
 Let me first say how thrilled I am to finally meet you in... person. 
 Uh, you okay there, Laura? 
 Yeah. Just have a little thing about, um... blood. Um... 
 Oh. 
 Very sorry, but I'm fine. 
 Quite all right. 
 Why don't we just get right to it, then? 
 Yes, ma'am. As you may have read in your briefing book, the Selva Region of eastern Ecuador is one of the most bio-diverse areas of the Amazon, and indeed the world. 
 Mike : Home to... count them... ten primate species, including the rare Titi monkey. 
 There's an image for you. 
 Laura : Developing it would be extremely damaging to the local... um... but also... 
 But also, it is important to remember that the Amazon is the world's carbon sink where much of the CO2 we produce is absorbed by the trees of... 
 Uh-oh. 
 Oh, God. 
 So embarrassed. Excuse me, ma'am. 
 (mutters) 
 Okay. 
 Mike : Hope she makes it to the porcelain sink in time. 
 Why don't you go see if she's okay. 
 Right, the point being, if a tract this big is developed, it will speed up the deforestation process, which will ultimately lead to what? 
 Ocean acidification, species die-offs, larger and more unpredictable weather events, increased climate-driven conflicts and refugees. 
 You know, your typical 21st century end-of-the-world buffet. 
 Got it. 
 Laura : Sorry. False alarm. 
 Ma'am, there are more tree species in a single hectare of the Selva region than in all of North America. 
 If there's a cure for cancer or HIV, we will probably find it there. 
 Mike : Counterpoint. 
 Chip Harding donates millions of dollars each election cycle, which will either be used for or against your president. 
 Just something to weigh against the sad monkeys and magic trees. 
 And it is part of our job to promote U.S. businesses abroad, but if we want to have a voice in the decision, we need to act now. 
 The Ecuadorians are planning whether to develop the Selva within a month. 
 Oh, plenty of time. 
 All right, why don't we go see what we can do for Mr. Harding. 
 Ma'am. 
 Oh! 
 Oh. Have fun. 
 I got it. I got it. 
 Okay. What are you even doing here? 
 I'm attending your meeting with Chip... 
 Chip Harding, ma'am. 
 Okay, isn't Abby about to go into labor any second? 
 Literally any second. 
 So, go, go. 
 I can handle Harding by myself. 
 If I need more information, I'll get it from Laura back... 
 Brilliant, and she really wanted to make an impression. 
 Oh, she did. It's all set. 
 Go right now. 
 Here. 
 Okay. There you go. 
 Oh, there. Thank you. 
 Tell Abby to get the epidural early! 
 You got it! 
 Key word: early. 
 Madam Secretary, I'm busy, and I'm sure you are, too, so I'll get straight to the point. 
 I would love it if the government would just get out of our way. 
 Or better yet, help us out for once. 
 There's a concept. 
 What is it that you feel isn't being done for the oil industry, Mr. Harding? 
 The SEC and Justice are breathing down our neck about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
 Do take a dim view of bribing foreign officials, yes. 
 Come on, you know full well that that's the way business gets done in places like Ecuador. 
 And let me tell you something. 
 The Chinese aren't wringing their hands about doing business. 
 Given that I can't help you bribe anybody, what exactly would you like the State Department to do? 
 Offer them aid. 
 Help in developing vital infrastructure. 
 We do give them aid. 
 $218 million last year, to be exact, but it does come with anti-corruption safeguards built in. 
 So, sorry if that's not helping you grease the wheels. 
 Look, the Selva's too valuable not to be developed. 
 That's just the facts. 
 Who do you and the president prefer to see do it... us or the Chinese? 
 I guarantee you we care very deeply about what happens in the Selva region, and I will bear your concerns in mind when I meet with the Ecuadorian ambassador. 
 Thank you so much for coming in. 
 A great game is afoot, Madam Secretary, and we can't win it with one hand tied behind our back. 
 I hope the president understands that. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 You bet. 
 Everyone okay? 
 Well, it's not like we have hurt feelies. 
 Although, that was quite an outburst. 
 I understand she's been through a lot, but the fact is, she needs to prep for  Face the Nation. 
 I'll try to block out some time in her schedule for this afternoon. 
 Matt : It's not like we're being overly dramatic. 
 Rogue CIA director starts a coup in Iran under the White House's nose? 
 And the only reason it fails is because she literally puts herself in the line of fire. 
 That's a huge story. 
 Huge. 
 I'm aware. 
 And so is the public, but they haven't seen her since the funerals three days ago. 
 And the longer they don't, the more she's gonna be pulled into the morass of suspicion and blame. 
 She needs to tell her story, and she can't just wing it. 
 Woman :  As it says  in your packet, drop-off is between 7:30 and 7:50, but there can be a bit of a line sometimes, so it's worth getting here early. 
 Henry : Maybe if we had a different kid. 
 (woman laughs) 
 Well, that covers it. 
 Welcome to Monroe Junior High. 
 I'd like to revisit the security issue if I may. 
 Uh, of course. 
 Uh, as I mentioned, student safety is our number one priority. 
 We have two full-time security officers, metal detectors at every entrance and a zero-tolerance policy on weapons and bullying. 
 Jason will be in good hands here, Mrs. McCord. 
 I'm sure he will be. 
 Elizabeth : The thing is, I'm not. 
 I'd like to provide Jason with a security detail. 
 Henry : Wait. What? 
 No, no. 
 Nothing obtrusive, just one man. 
 Given who I am and what I do, I feel that it's necessary. 
 Will you excuse us for one minute? 
 Absolutely. 
 Do you want to tell me what's going on? 
 Just what I said. 
 I think Jason needs extra security. 
 Well, the threat assessment guys at Diplomatic Security don't think he does. 
 Well, I'm their boss. 
 Not when it comes to assigning a security detail, you're not. 
 Besides, you said you wanted Jason to have as normal a school experience as possible, as did I. 
 We settled this. 
 I am fourth in line for the presidency of the United States. 
 He doesn't get to be a normal child. 
 Okay. Is this about what happened in Iran? 
 No. 
 Because if you want to talk to me, then, please... 
 Why can't you just back me up on this? 
 Okay. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 I will call Diplomatic Security and have them send me over a couple of candidates. 
 How's that? 
 Thank you. 
 I have to get back to work, so I'll see you tonight. 
 Professor McCord? 
 I'm thinking you're the bodyguard. 
 Uh, call me Henry. 
 Come on in. 
 Kevin Boyd. 
 Henry :  You got quite a resume. 
 Six years doing security at State. 
 Before that, ten years as a recon Marine. Oorah. 
 Yes, sir. Forcecon, 2nd Division out of Lejeune. 
 You serve in the Corps? 
 Third MAW out of Miramar. I flew Hornets in Desert Storm. 
 You know, the original. 
 Oorah, sir. 
 I did a couple tours in the sequel myself. 
 Ah, but the question is, has all your extensive combat experience prepared you to take a 13-year-old to middle school? 
 Let's just say, no one will be taking Jason's milk money. 
 (chuckles) I'm gonna be honest with you. 
 This is really less about an actual security threat and more about an abundance of caution. 
 Peace of mind. Copy that, sir. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 You saw a lot of action, so I'm sure you know guys that came back with issues, yeah? 
 You mean PTSD? 
 Yeah. 
 In-in your experience, how did that manifest? 
 Well, due respect, sir, with your experience, you must have seen a fair share yourself. 
 My buddies and I were dropping ordinance from 30,000 feet. 
 Now, that's a thing, but it ain't Fallujah. 
 I'm just curious how it looked to you. 
 Well, a lot of guys don't sleep, temper's on a hair-trigger, usually they're having flashbacks, they're hyper-vigilant. 
 I got a buddy, can't drive anymore. 
 Thinks every piece of trash he sees lying in the gutter is hiding an IED. 
 Yeah, there's not much you can do, besides be there for them. 
 You can try to get them help, but they're not gonna talk until they're ready, so... 
 But just so we're crystal clear here, sir, I don't have... 
 Oh, I... I trust you. 
 Hey, listen, the job is yours if you want it. 
 I'm just concerned you're a little too inconspicuous. 
 That's usually the deal-breaker. 
 Elizabeth :  I am meeting with the Ecuadorian Ambassador in five minutes. What don't I know? 
 International conservation groups have a plan that would pay Ecuador to turn the entire Selva Region into a protected preserve. 
 So, essentially, they would bribe Ecuador not to despoil its own rainforest? 
 That's the idea, ma'am, yes. 
 And the Ecuadorians have actually been receptive to the plan. 
 Well, who doesn't like a bribe? 
 Okay, but? 
 So far, no one's been inclined to kick in the start-up costs, which are in the low billions. 
 Especially when the potential oil revenues could be a hundred times that. 
 So what are you pitching me? 
 Ah... 
 You want us to do nothing with the Selva? 
 Not nothing, Ambassador Calderon. 
 I'm suggesting that you move forward with the plan to turn it into a protected preserve. 
 (laughs): Please. Your current Congress would never allot such a large sum for rainforest conservation. 
 Maybe coca eradication, but let's ask our neighbors, the Colombians, how that's working out for the environment. 
 I know it's a stretch, and, obviously, there are some trust issues. 
 To put it mildly. 
 We're still cleaning up oil spills American companies caused in the 1970s. 
 But if I could get the money, which I am working on right now, would your government consider preserving the entirety of the Selva Region? 
 If you could match the Chinese offer, perhaps. 
 But you can't. 
 And certainly not within a plausible time frame. 
 So, and with all due respect, Madam Secretary, we stick with the Chinese. 
 They're not your friends, you know. 
 (laughs) 
 But then... they don't pretend to be. 
 Matt (like Bob Schieffer) : Madam Secretary, welcome to  Face the Nation. 
 Thank you, pretend Bob Schieffer. 
 Nadine : Matt, not so much with the voice. 
 Come on. 
 Daisy : Oh, but he's so sadly proud of it. 
 Fine. Your loss. 
 (normal voice): Madam Secretary, recent events paint a troubling picture of the Dalton Administration. 
 Should America be worried about this president's leadership? 
 Not at all. 
 Andrew Munsey was a very capable spy. 
 He managed to hide his traitorous acts for quite some time. 
 But the moment the president learned of them, he leapt into action and saved the nation, and the world, from a dangerous fate. 
 Matt : Well, some would argue that you did that, first by uncovering the conspiracy, and second by your unprecedented trip to Iran. 
 Come on, he's not gonna ask that. 
 Daisy : Oh, well, it's a fair interpretation of the facts, ma'am. 
 Uh, fine. 
 (clears throat) 
 While I was glad to do my part, the fact that we are now on the other side of a constitutional and global crisis is a testament to our president's courageous leadership. 
 Madam Secretary, you were present when Iranian Foreign Minister Javani was killed, along with several others. 
 Yeah. Yes, I was. 
 Tell me about that horrifying scene. 
 Who was there with you, and-and what happened? 
 (ears ringing) 
 (gunfire, explosions in distance) 
 (ears ringing louder) 
 (explosion, indistinct shouting) 
 (gunfire) 
 Abdol! 
 (gunfire continues) 
 (shouting) 
 Abdol, stay down! 
 Nadine : Ma'am? 
 Ma'am? 
 Want to give me that again? 
 Uh, sure. 
 Nadine : Um, you know what? 
 Why don't we take a break? Okay? 
 Yup. 
 (sighs) What the hell was that? 
 It's five seconds of dead air. 
 Well, arguably, that was a little more than that, Daisy. 
 I understand that, but whatever it was, it wasn't exactly the image of calm stability the White House is looking to project. 
 I think we should cancel. We can't risk her having an incident like that on television. 
 You want to tell her that? 
 Call the show, make her appearance subject to availability. 
 We'll take another run at this tomorrow. 
 If she's still tentative, we've laid the groundwork for a postponement. 
 On it. 
 Okay. 
 (water splashing) 
 (ears ringing, explosions in distance) 
 (man shouting) 
 (panting slowly) 
 Elizabeth :  Jason, this is  about your safety. 
 Jason : Yeah, well, then I'll be safe at home, because I'm not going. 
 You guys can't just spring this on me. 
 You said I'd be a normal kid at a normal school. 
 This isn't fair! 
 And yet, this is happening, so I need you to get your stuff and get on board. 
 Kevin, can we have a couple minutes, please? 
 Of course. 
 Jason, grab your stuff. 
 No, no, Dad, I'm not... 
 Just do it, son. 
 I love you. 
 Uh-huh. 
 (sighs) 
 Well, he's right, babe. It isn't fair. 
 Well, life isn't fair. 
 Huh. 
 In this house, it is. 
 I knew it. 
 I knew you would make me the bad guy. 
 And then, you had to pick, like, the biggest guy on the planet just to push all of Jason's buttons. 
 Okay, look, I know that you have been through a lot, and that you don't want to talk about it. 
 Don't psychoanalyze me. 
 But maybe that's behind your sudden obsession with Jason's security... 
 And don't condescend to me, Henry! 
 We don't talk to each other that way. 
 If you had seen what I've seen, you would want him to have protection, too, okay? 
 He doesn't need it. 
 So, we either keep our word and let him go to school without security, or he stays home. 
 Okay, so it's okay for you not to fight fair. 
 Is that how we do it now? Is that it? 
 On this one, yeah. We're not gonna let your issues... 
 My issues?! 
 ...force Jason to be treated unfairly. 
 What are my issues? 
 Are you ready to talk? 
 Let's talk. 
 Fine. I don't have time for this. You win. 
 Okay? 
 And the Italian embassy wants to honor you with a dinner on the 24th. 
 Well, it's worth saying yes just for the food. 
 What's this, uh, "subject to availability" BS I'm hearing? 
 Russell Jackson, ma'am. 
 Thanks for the heads-up, Blake. Uh, which BS is that, Russell? 
 Face The Nation. 
 You put a pin in your appearance. 
 I was wondering why. 
 Well, since this is the first time I'm hearing about it, so would I. 
 I thought it would be better to leave some flexibility there, ma'am. 
 Jackson : Why? 
 Hey, you don't get to interrogate my staff, Russell. 
 But I think they're just trying to protect me. 
 (clears throat) In prep yesterday, I was still a little jetlagged, but I'll be fine on the day. 
 And just to be clear, I am doing the show. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Wonderful. 
 You have a second to talk about Ecuador with me? 
 Sure. Um, Laura, will you join us, please? 
 Jackson :  I also hear  we're handing over one of the biggest oil fields in the hemisphere to the Chinese? 
 Got a testy phone call from Chip Harding, did we? 
 (sighs) Is there any other kind? 
 You know the president is committed to weaning us off Middle Eastern oil. 
 He's also committed to preserving the Amazon. 
 Which is why we are signatories to RACTO, or whatever the hell that is. 
 Rainforests of the Americas Conservation Treaty Organization, sir. 
 You're the fainter, aren't you? 
 (groans): Mm. 
 (laughs): I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 It's just that nothing funny ever happens in this town. 
 Don't worry. You'll bounce back. 
 Look, for a few billion dollars, we can save one of the most ecologically-important areas on Earth. 
 If you've got a few billion dollars lying around, go for it, because Congress won't. 
 And at least Ashmont Petroleum would be bound by the treaty to develop the oil field as... 
 Come on. 
 We're not seriously falling back on the mighty RACTO? 
 ...as non-invasively as possible. Isn't that correct? 
 Theoretically, sir. 
 Which is more than the Chinese can say. 
 Look, I'm all for saving the planet, but the bottom line is, if we can't get our company in, we should at least keep the Chinese one out. 
 These are independent countries, Russell. 
 I don't have a lot of cards to play. 
 So find more cards. 
 Thank you, Laura. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 And technically, sir, I vomited... a little. 
 Good to know. 
 (sighs) 
 Look, Bess, this coup business is the worst body blow to the presidency since Watergate. 
 The public needs to know their government hasn't slid off a cliff, which means you need to go on  Face the Nation. 
 So... you up for the damn show or not? 
 Absolutely. 
 Do you have any ideas about what I might do, or are the taxpayers just shelling out for another one of Gordon's expensive walks? 
 (chuckles): Look, saving a little piece of the Amazon probably won't matter in the end anyway. 
 Best to win Dalton some goodwill with Chip Harding. 
 How? By getting Justice off his back so he can go back to Ecuador and... bribe his way into winning the bid? 
 Yes. But just in case I'm ever deposed, no. 
 Yeah, I'm not doing that. 
 Besides, you literally just called him a pompous tool. 
 He really is. Even other pompous tool CEOs hate him. 
 Like my friend, Owen Walton. 
 Pompous tools run the world. 
 You might as well get on their good side. 
 And hope that the tiny sliver of the Amazon that's left is protected by RACTO? 
 The "T," by the way, stands for "toothless". 
 There you go. 
 How can the Chinese purport to be a responsible actor in the Amazon when they're not even a party to the treaty charged with its protection? 
 I was being you there. 
 So tie up China by officially protesting their non-membership? 
 RACTO may be toothless, but Ecuador is a signatory. 
 China would be forced to respond. 
 Whew. Talk about poking the bear. 
 Look, the White House wants to keep them out of our backyard. 
 It would take China at least a year to unstick themselves from all the red tape. During which time... 
 The Selva isn't developed. And Ashmont Petroleum gets its ducks in a row and wins the contract. 
 So both the Earth and America win. 
 Until America actually wins. 
 Man (in distance) : Be advised, we're losing the fight, but not by much. Don't underestimate these terrorists. 
 (faint gunfire, explosions) 
 I can't find a break! I don't have a shot! 
 
 
 
 It's late. 
 I didn't even hear you come in. 
 Just winding down. 
 By playing a video game you've never shown any interest in at 3:30 in the morning? 
 Yup. 
 Okay, babe, your Titan is ready. 
 See? Here, press this button, get your Titan. 
 You play this game way more than you cop to. 
 (chuckles) Possibly true. 
 Woman : Transferring control to pilot. 
 Sorry I was such a bitch before. 
 It's okay. 
 How was Jason's first day? 
 It was fine. Everything's fine. 
 No, it isn't. 
 Minister Chen is waiting for you. 
 (sighs) 
 Took a detour from his White House visit to let us know how pissed he is about our little Ecuador maneuver? 
 I'm guessing. 
 Well, that would be a safe guess. 
 Ma'am, pardon me, but... you look a little tired. 
 (laughs) Thanks, Nadine. 
 No, really. Are you sleeping all right? 
 Like a baby. 
 Daisy : Oh, congratulations again, Jay. 
 She's gorgeous. Here's the secretary. 
 Abby had the baby. A little girl. 
 Oh, oh. 
 My gosh. 
 Well, hey, sweetheart. 
 Hey, boss. 
 Not you. 
 What's her name? 
 Wait for it. 
 Chloe Elizabeth Whitman. 
 What a suck-up! 
 Aw. 
 It's her grandmother's name, jerk. 
 Hey, come on, honey. 
 Say hi to the secretary, sweetheart. 
 Oh, she's... she's beautiful, Jay. 
 She's just... 
 Blake : Ma'am. 
 Minister Chen. 
 Nadine : Ma'am. 
 Listen, you bring her in really soon, okay? 
 I want to meet her in person. 
 Chen :  Madam Secretary,  this protest you've lodged with RACTO is clearly a stalling tactic. 
 You want to help Ashmont Petroleum win a bid they couldn't win honestly or fairly. 
 You really want to accuse Ashmont Petroleum of being the only unscrupulous actor here? 
 I would suggest you tread carefully, Madam Secretary. 
 So you're saying that it is not common Chinese business practice to get at-at the resources of developing nations by bribing their elites? 
 The West did just that for centuries, including to China. 
 Just because it's your turn now doesn't make it right. 
 While fascinating, this philosophical discussion is hardly germane. 
 I strongly urge you to retract your protest. 
 But there are so many other fascinating subjects to discuss. 
 Your currency devaluation, unfair export subsidies, intellectual property theft. I mean, not to mention Madam Secretary... your labor and environmental... 
 Can we even call them laws? (laughs) 
 More like suggestions. 
 Madam Secretary, this inflammatory performance will not help your cause in Ecuador or in any other area. 
 Perhaps we should talk at a later time. 
 My-my apologies. Let's... 
 Let's talk about something less inflammatory. 
 How are your children? 
 They're fine. 
 Good, good. 
 Kids are a blessing. 
 Indeed. 
 Course, when they look back at the Amazon and what we did to it, they'll think we must have hated them. 
 Again, ma'am, these remarks... 
 No, no, it's interesting, because, you see, if we chop it all down, we pretty much guarantee that the planet overheats, and our kids will live in a totally destabilized world. 
 (scoffs) Well, then at least they'll be able to go to war with each other over fresh water. 
 That'll be kicky. 
 Madam Secretary, are you quite all right? 
 Are you not hearing me?! 
 Your children and mine will suffer because of choices we make today. 
 They will suffer, and there will be nothing that we can do to help them! 
 Is that what you want?! Is that... (pants) 
 Will you excuse me for a minute, please? 
 (door closes) 
 (panting): Will you call 911? 
 I think I'm having a heart attack. 
 (siren wailing) 
 46-year-old female presenting with chest pain, shortness of breath, sinus tach and hypertensive on two liters of O2, aspirin and EKG on the bus. 
 Get her a X-ray, blood draw and sublingual nitroglycerin, and take her up to Cardiac Care. 
 Elizabeth? Elizabeth, I'm here. 
 We're going to take good care of you, Madam Secretary. 
 How is she? 
 We're taking her upstairs to run some tests now. 
 It's okay, sweetheart, I'm here. It's gonna be all right. 
 Well, the good news is that you're fine. 
 You didn't have a heart attack. 
 Henry : So what was it, then? 
 Well, uh, most likely a panic attack. 
 You have got the job for it. 
 Oh, God. 
 Is it bad that I wish that I'd actually had a heart attack? 
 Now, going forward, I'd recommend you go easy on the coffee, take a few personal days. 
 From what I see in the news, you've been pretty busy. 
 Henry : Thank you, Doctor. 
 Navy SEALs get this, you know. 
 You tougher than a Navy SEAL? 
 Maybe, like, a-a really runty one. 
 I think maybe I got a little bit more affected by Iran than I thought. 
 But it was one incident, and it passed and I'm fine. 
 Look, I know you think you can tough this out, but guess what, you can't. 
 You have got to get help now, before this really takes hold and gets worse. 
 I can't just drop everything and take a spa day because I'm sad. 
 Stop. You don't have to drop everything; you just need to talk to someone. 
 I know. I'm all messed up. 
 One minute I'm fine, and then the next I'm furious, then I'm numb. 
 Well, considering what you've been through, it's totally normal. 
 (laughs) Really? 
 Because it feels... totally crazy. 
 (sniffles) 
 The truth is, I'm just not ready to talk about what happened yet. 
 Okay. 
 But you heard the doctor, yeah? 
 Yup. 
 You need to take a few days off. 
 I can't. It would be a whole thing. 
 So what? 
 This is your health we're talking about. 
 I hear you. I do, I really do. 
 (sniffles) 
 But we're okay, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry I've been screaming at you a lot. 
 No, it's totally good. It's fun. 
 (laughs) 
 I'm gonna go get Stevie. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Is she okay? 
 She's fine. She's totally fine. 
 Just go in and talk to her. 
 Okay. 
 I'll be right there. 
 Russell, are those for me? You shouldn't have. 
 How is she? 
 She's fine. 
 Good. Then I'll just go in and convey the president's best wishes. 
 I said she's fine, Russell. 
 Tell that to the Chinese. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Hope you're right, Henry. I really do. 
 But if she's not fine, then you're not doing her or your country any favors by keeping it from me. 
 Give her these for me, will you? 
 The doctors concluded the secretary is in good health and was simply exhausted. 
 No, they didn't. 
 Guys, she can't be exhausted. 
 Ed Muskie was exhausted. 
 "Exhausted" is Washington code for complete mental freak-out, you 12-year-olds. 
 Blake : Please, say "exhausted" more. 
 Matt : Hey, she flew to Iran, thwarted a coup, then flew home and went right back to work. 
 I think America would understand if she's a little tired. 
 Mike is, um... 
 Right. 
 Right. 
 Listen, the story the White House is peddling is "nothing to see here". 
 Implying that the secretary had some sort of breakdown is definitely something to see. 
 I'd bet my second house that Russell Jackson is at the hospital right now, trying to find out if our beloved Bess has gone around the bend. 
 He actually is at the hospital right now. 
 I just heard from her detail. 
 Mike : Look at that... I'm psychic. 
 And if he decides she is, she'll be tossed overboard, but quick. 
 Daisy : Fine, no exhaustion. 
 We'll just stick to the facts: she was feeling unwell, she went to the hospital, doctors say she's fine. 
 Matt : And answer any follow-ups with, "I don't speculate, I'm not a doctor." 
 See? Now you actually sound like you know what you're doing. 
 Oh, drop dead, old man. 
 Daisy : Okay, the real question is: do we really think she's actually okay? 
 Oh, of course she is. 
 Matt : Based on what, Blake? The fact that she bawled out the foreign minister of our biggest creditor? 
 Nadine : She's okay until she tells us she isn't. 
 Got it? 
 Obviously, we need to push back  Face the Nation  for at least a couple of days. Meanwhile, I've got to try to put out the fire with Minister Chen. 
 So let's get back to work. 
 (ringtone playing) 
 That's M. Sec now. 
 I know what you're all thinking: "Why is she calling him and not me?" 
 Well, shame on you, petty, petty people. 
 Hello. 
 I'm so relieved the secretary is feeling more like herself. 
 Please convey my warm regards. 
 I certainly will, and thank you again for your understanding and for stopping by. 
 Think nothing of it. 
 But if the secretary continues to push forward with this attempt to stymie our rightful and lawful investment in Ecuador... that, China might not be so quick to forgive. 
 Well, I would not presume to speak for the secretary on such a serious issue, but I will certainly convey your concern. 
 See that you do. 
 Because if the secretary's words were not a moment of unreason but rather indicative of an official attitude toward China... 
 I assure you they were not. 
 ...then China, in turn, might begin to feel that the United States' debt is a less than reliable investment for our surplus. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Good day, Ms. Tolliver. 
 Good day, sir. 
 Oy. 
 Yeah. 
 Mike : Wait till you see how inspired the lowly grunts are by their unsinkable leader. 
 Bounces back from a heart attack the same day. 
 Imaginary heart attack. Huzzah, huzzah. 
 It's better than a real one, believe you me. 
 So are you up for this meeting with Owen? 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 Glad to have you back. 
 Because even though he was in town, it took a lot of wrangling Thanks, Erin. to get him into the room under such short notice. 
 I'm not going to embarrass you. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Good, because if it were up to me, the only person you'd be in a room with is a psychiatrist. 
 (laughs) Well, thanks for the vote of confidence. 
 I'm withholding that until we see if your plan actually works. 
 So, you set? 
 (ears ringing) 
 (gunfire) 
 Abdol! 
 (shouts) 
 You good? 
 What? 
 Are... Are you good to go? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, absolutely. I just... 
 I'm gonna... Um... One thing... 
 No, no, I got it. I got it. I'm... Right back. 
 Henry? 
 Yeah. 
 So... 
 ...turns out, you were right. 
 Maybe, um, coming back today wasn't such a hot idea after all. 
 Owen, it's been too long. St. Moritz, right? 
 How the hell are you? 
 Uh, well, a little confused. 
 I thought I was meeting the secretary. 
 We were walking in the door, she got a call from the White House. Big mess in Russia. 
 Very big, very messy. But you didn't hear it from us. 
 Nadine Tolliver, Secretary McCord's chief of staff. 
 Thank you so much for coming in. 
 And this is Laura... something something. 
 Uh, Vargas. Pleased to meet you. 
 Uh, look, I-I don't want to be rude or whatever, but I've got a gala I'm supposed to go to in a little while... 
 Oh, Mr. Walton, please. 
 The secretary had hoped to discuss an opportunity with you. 
 The chance for your charitable foundation to save over 4,000 square miles of pristine Amazonian rainforest. 
 While th-that's an important number unto itself, the positive impact on the health of the planet would be exponentially larger. 
 Uh, look, uh, that... This is super cool and I'm all about the environment. 
 I mean, my foundation is already doing this whole thing with reefs. 
 Or maybe sharks. But either way, it's amazing. 
 You should set up a meeting with them. 
 Let me put all this another way, Owen. 
 How would you like to win a Nobel Prize for sticking it to Chip Harding? 
 Chip wants to drill down there? 
 I'm listening. 
 Russell. 
 Evening, Henry. 
 Look... 
 I come in peace. 
 Good fix you had on the Ecuador thing. 
 Sounds like your team handled it well, too. 
 I shouldn't have doubted you. 
 Thanks. 
 I mean, China's not happy. 
 Yeah, well, they lost. 
 And because I screamed at Minister Chen. 
 Nadine calmed him down. 
 And the vice-president's taking him bowling or some damn thing. 
 Summer after junior year of high school, my big brother Kenny took me fishing for getting straight A's. 
 My dad took off when we were kids, so... 
 Anyway, we were driving back, at night, and this drunk hunter T-boned us with his truck. 
 I was a little banged up. 
 But Kenny died at the scene. 
 Makes it back from Vietnam in one piece, he dies right there on the side of the highway with the paramedics working on him and the looky-loos slowing down and gawk. 
 Anyway, I'm mostly good now. 
 I won't bore you with my triggers. 
 Suffice to say I haven't been fishing in a while. 
 Here's someone who can keep her mouth shut. 
 Welcome to the club. 
 Thanks, Russell. 
 Take care of yourself, Bess. 
 I wonder how she's doing. 
 Well, her last text said she was resting... and bored. 
 Oh. 
 So, Laura, way to hit it out of the park on your first at bat. 
 Welcome to the bigs. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, uh, he's terrible at sports, by the way. 
 Don't do... Don't say... 
 Most of my friends from grad school are still writing their dissertations. 
 We actually did something today. 
 To that rarest of Washington feats: actually doing something. 
 Hear, hear. 
 Yes. -  Salud. 
 I just hope the media noise about the hospital visit will die down. 
 Honestly, I don't think it will until she does  Face the Nation. 
 If Face the Nation. Man (over TV) : That's a double kill. (gunfire) Do you want to tell me about it? Fred Cole and the guys in my detail died because I went to Iran. They died saving me. They died saving their country from a war. They died doing their duty. They died... because of me. Babe, you did not force Fred Cole to run toward the gunfire. That was his choice. And you know he would do it again. And then there's Abdol. Javani's son, right? What about him? He was there. He was there in the room, too. I didn't tell you... I didn't tell anyone... 'cause I couldn't get to him. I wanted so badly to protect that boy. Or at least keep him from seeing his father murdered in his own living room. But I couldn't. Fred was on top of me. And I couldn't... get to him. How in the world is that boy supposed to go on? We do all these horrible things to each other. And there are always, always kids in the middle. Henry, what have I done to our sweet children? Bob Schieffer :  Madam Secretary, you made an unprecedented trip to Iran to save  the nuclear deal between the Iranians and the United States. Yes, I did. And while you were there, of course, a coup that was eventually, uh, foiled, uh, began. You were in the room when the foreign minister Javani was killed. That's right. Who else was there, and-and what happened? We were at Minister Javani's house when it happened. Several members of my security detail were wounded or killed. Their courage was awe-inspiring, and I deeply mourn their loss, as does the entire country. Minister Javani's son witnessed his father's death. As a mother, I would have given anything to protect that child. Which is why I am determined as ever to see through the nuclear agreement that his father gave his life for. Because I think that's our greatest responsibility in this life: to leave a safer and more peaceful world for our children. Schieffer :  Madam Secretary, thank you. Elizabeth :  Thank you, Bob.
