 I just got fired. 
 And what about me? 
 What about you? 
 What about me? 
 Okay. That's it. 
 I'm going over there right f*cking now, before they leave. 
 Erlich, I'm gonna use your car. 
 Jared, you call Ron LaFlamme, tell him to meet me there. 
 f*ck these assholes! 
 Wait. Richard, I'm coming with you. 
 Here. Jared, clear this. 
 Get all the smoke out of it. 
 Otherwise, it damages the device. 
 Umm... 
 Don't be a pussy. 
 Richard : How could they do this? 
 How could they fire me from my own company? 
 Erlich : Just stay calm. We're gonna fight this. 
 Jesus, Richard, slow down. 
 Stop, stop, stop! 
 Did I just hit a deer? 
 No, goddamn it! 
 f*cking Stanford Robotics. 
 sh1t. Is this gonna make us late? 
 Oh! They killed the Bam-bot. 
 f*ck your Bam-bot! 
 You little Stanford c**ts f*cked up my grille! 
 f*cking piece of sh1t! 
 Wait. 
 You little c**t! 
 f*ck! 
 Richard : Hey. 
 This one's for your mama. 
 Erlich, stop. Come on. Erlich, we've got to get to Raviga. 
 Hey, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Richard : Thanks for coming, Ron. 
 Ron : I'd bail on spin class any day for you, Richie. 
 Richard. Richard. 
 I kept calling, you weren't answering. 
 Talk to the hand, Monica. 
 Richard, can you stop? I can explain, okay? 
 It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica. You voted to fire me. 
 What the f*ck? 
 I mean, there is no way I'm letting you push me out of this. 
 Our intention is not to push you out. 
 We wish rather to transition you to a more appropriate role within the company. 
 A new CEO will be brought in to manage day-to-day operations while you assume the role of Chief Technology Officer. 
 Congratulations. 
 CTO? Yes. 
 You want me to be an employee at my own company? 
 You would still be in charge of the engineering, and you'd continue vesting your shares, and keep your board seat. 
 The same seat I had an hour ago when you voted to fire me as CEO? 
 That came in handy. 
 Richard, please. 
 I realize this may be bittersweet, but earlier this evening Raviga decided to officially fund Pied Piper Series A Round at $5 million at a $50 million valuation. 
 Essentially, you have created a company that is too valuable for you to run. 
 You should feel good about that. 
 Are you kidding me? I made the company, okay? 
 I'm the one who came up with the name "Pied Piper." 
 Yeah. 
 Ron, can I have a word please? 
 They can't really do this, can they? 
 I think they just did. 
 You remember that sh1t deal you brought me from Hanneman, and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a sh1t deal," but you took it anyway because you wanted to do something crazy for once in your life? 
 Yes, I remember. 
 Well, you basically just loaded a gun and handed it to Hanneman, and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga, and then Raviga just f*cking pistol-whipped you. 
 But hey, at least they're letting you keep your shares and your board seat. 
 You lose a little blood with the dilution for the new CEO, but I've seen worse. 
 Like that sh1t deal you brought me from Hanneman. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 If we give Richard a little bit of space, he'll be able to wrap his head around this, and a smooth transition to a new CEO will be possible. 
 To wit, I served as the CEO of Aviat... 
 Mr. Bachman. 
 In the version of Pied Piper in which I am invested, you will not be CEO. Not now. Not ever. 
 Well, you, madam, are a shrew of the first order. 
 Okay. I'm not gonna let you do this. 
 I'm gonna fight it. 
 I understand you're upset. 
 As you can see, this is a very emotional time for me as well, but we have some very strong candidates coming in for the CEO position, and we would so appreciate your input. 
 My input? 
 Mmm. 
 You want me to help you pick my new replacement? 
 I'd rather quit. 
 And I don't care how much money I lose, because I am gonna get it all back when I sue the living sh1t out of you! 
 Okay. All right. All right. 
 Ron, let's go. 
 Sorry, I'm forced to inform you that I can no longer provide you with legal counsel. 
 What are you talking about? You're my attorney. 
 No. Technically, I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel, and you just declared your intention to walk. 
 So, in effect, you kind of just threatened to sue me, and I don't take kindly to threats, Mr. Hendricks. 
 "Mr. Hendricks"? 
 What happened to "Richie"? 
 Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to discuss him with you either, Mr. Hendricks.

 Monica : Richard, if I didn't vote to remove you, then Laurie would've adjourned the meeting, replaced my seat on the board with someone else at Raviga, and then they would've voted to remove you. 
 At least this way, I'm still in the game. 
 No. You mean, at least this way, you kept your job. 
 At least the actual Judas had the courtesy to kill himself after betraying his leader, Jesus Christ. 
 He's the CEO of the world. Ever heard of him? 
 Yeah. Got it. Went to Catholic school. 
 Really? How long? 
 Look, I'm still on the board of this company. 
 I'll be in all of the meetings. 
 Maybe I can be helpful at some point. 
 You wanna be helpful, Monica? 
 Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO. 
 Look, I know I made some mistakes. I wasn't perfect, but I'll get better. I'll even go to one of those CEO coaches, like that guy at f*cking Twitter. 
 Richard, it's done. 
 Laurie already found a new CEO. 
 What? Already? 
 You said that you didn't want to be part of the interview process, so they picked someone this morning. 
 Jack Barker. He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO. 
 I don't care who he is, okay? None of us do. 
 (KEYBOARDS CLICKING) 
 "Action" Jack Barker? 
 Seriously? They picked that gray-haired fossil over me? 
 You said you turned the job down. 
 I said it was mutual. 
 Oh. 
 What? That's accurate. 
 He ran Entercross Systems. 
 They IPO'ed in 1998 for more than a billion dollars. 
 Yeah, 20 f*cking years ago. 
 Tech 1.0. What has he done lately? 
 After that, he ran Turnwire for four years until it was acquired by Microsoft for $2 billion. 
 Holy sh1t. This guy's a hitter. 
 He was, in the oughts. What's he done in the 20-teens? 
 Looks like he started a foundation in his mother's name to cure cancer. 
 Yeah, how's that going? (SCOFFS) 
 Yeah. I bet his mother's dead. 
 Yeah, that's probably why he started the foundation. 
 Richard, Laurie's meeting with him tomorrow. 
 You should come in and talk with him. 
 No f*cking way. 
 Think this through. I mean, you have to know that you can't start another compression company. 
 No VC will fund that out of fear of being sued, and unless you have some totally different, game-changing idea lying around... 
 So you're saying that I'm f*cked if I leave? 
 No, I'm saying that... 
 Okay. Well, then I guess I'm f*cked, because I'm out. 
 And when I leave, Jared's out, Dinesh is out, Gilfoyle is out. 
 Everybody's out. 
 So good luck with the company there, Monica. 
 It'll just be you, Laurie Bream, and some f*cking asshole who can't even cure cancer. 
 He's right. 
 Where Richard goes, I go. 
 Monica, excuse how high I am, but are the uniforms in Catholic schools as low-cut as they are online? 
 f*ck off.

 No. Did you? 
 No.

 We haven't spoken in some time.

 Thank you all for coming on such short notice. 
 I have a difficult announcement to make. 
 We, in the tech business, often refer to failure as a good thing. 
 Failure is growth. 
 Failure is learning.

 I didn't think it would be this hard.

 (MURMURING) 
 All Nucleus personnel will be given proper notice and terminated. 
 But make no mistake. 
 Though they're the ones leaving, it is I who must remain and bear the heavy burden of their failure. 
 It is my fault. 
 I trusted them to get the job done.

 He's wonderful. 
 Nevertheless, he is lacking in certain... managerial capacities. 
 Totally fair. 
 It's fair, right? 
 He's still a great coder. 
 And an amazing human being. 
 Okay, look. 
 Such... 
 We have a lot of sh1t we want to say about him. 
 Do we have to keep prefacing it with all this nice-guy stuff? 
 I mean, if so, we're gonna be here all night.

 Exactly.

 Rigby is all the nice-guy stuff. 
 Okay. Rigby. 
 But he just assumed we were gonna leave with him, which is kind of total bullshit, right? 
 That's really arrogant. 
 Rigby. We gave up our own apps... so that we could bust our asses for him. 
 Why the f*ck should we give up our Pied Piper shares right when we get funded because he's too much of a prima donna to let someone experienced come in and run the company the way its supposed to be run. 
 Rigby. 
 Rigby. 
 Now I'm actually getting kind of f*cking angry! 
 I mean, we put in so much work for no pay, and now he thinks he's gonna walk out on us?

 Hooli stock jumped seven percent today on this news that Gavin Belson is writing down the entire Nucleus project. 
 What's happening here? 
 It was a courageous move. 
 He's a straight shooter, and obviously Wall Street is responding to that. 
 Woman : So, what else do you think... 
 So, by our account, just under 50 percent of Hooli employment agreements include a non-compete clause. 
 The same clause that caused us to lose the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration and are thus legally invalid, calling into question some of our IP ownership. 
 sh1t. I was afraid of that. 
 But hypothetically, this also presents an opportunity. 
 Any of those people could be dismissed with no severance. 
 Any unvested stock would return to the company option pool. 
 So, in other words, we have the right to terminate any of those people with no repercussions whatsoever, and we'd actually make money? 
 Correct. 
 You know, our annual individual performance reviews showed a 20 percent incidence of sub-standard work. 
 So essentially, one out of every five Hooli team members deserve to be fired. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. What? 
 So, are you nervous? 
 No, actually. I feel pretty good. 
 Flutterbeam was the best company we looked at. 
 Their tech is great. Their offer is amazing.

 Richard, you have to talk to this man. 
 Who, Barker? Pass. 
 This guy is real, okay, Richard? 
 With his managerial skills and your talent as an engineer, we could be talking about the D-word here. 
 Dick? 
 No. Decacorn. 
 A company that's valued over $10 billion before its initial public offering. 
 All right? 
 He's still at Raviga for another hour. 
 Please go talk to him. 
 Sorry, I can't do that. I'm already set up at Flutterbeam. 
 Whose CEO, unprompted, said, "A brain like Richard's comes along once in a generation." 
 Sorry. I'm just proud. 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Richard, I'm not asking you to spoon with the guy or even fork him. 
 What I'm asking for... 
 What is that? 
 Forking is when you use your dick and your two legs to stab him in the lower torso. 
 I'm asking for you to take 10 minutes and talk to him before you throw everything that we built away. 
 And yes, I did say "we." 
 I mean, if you want to stop by Raviga, it's on the way to Flutterbeam. 
 I mean, I threw some Tyson-level haymakers at this guy.

 He floats like a butterfly. 
 Hey, Richard.

 That's a bold statement. 
 Richard. 
 We have massive tech debt. 
 You really think that you can scale and deploy my library without any input from me? 
 Are you serious here? 
 Yes, we do. 
 Yeah. 
 Then I guess you are truly delusional. 
 Well, I think you're an arrogant prick. 
 I'm the arrogant prick. 
 Okay. This is coming from two people who think they know everything about code they didn't even write. 
 We wrote a lot of the code. 
 You wrote some of it. 
 You know what? We're gonna stay, and we're gonna build Pied Piper just to prove you wrong. 
 Okay. Thank you for the solidarity by the way, and sticking with your friend. 
 You know what, Erlich? 
 You can tell Barker to go f*ck himself, so I can go to Flutterbeam and then watch these two assholes crash and burn trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves.
