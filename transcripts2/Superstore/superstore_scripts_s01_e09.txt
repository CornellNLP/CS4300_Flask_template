 Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers, the store has been closed for 20 minutes. 
 Many of us would like to leave. 
 So, if you're still in the store, you're being a dick. 
 Don't be a dick. It's tough, because I have to live with this trash can, you know? Right. No, I get it. It's a very big decision. So, you know, maybe you could go home tonight, sleep on it, and decide tomorrow? No, "decide tomorrow" is what I said yesterday. [sighs] If I don't get home and study for my midterm, I'm totally screwed. Oh, hey, you look so cute. Both : Thank you. It's my senior dance recital tonight. What? Why didn't you tell us? Well, I can't perform because of, you know, this. Oh. But I'm gonna go and cheer on the other girls. Yeah, if this bozo ever leaves the store. Hey, Myrtle, go bust out your hysterectomy story. It's all right. I got it. [Heavy Metal music playing] It was 1953, and medical science was all the rage. The thing is, you just sent us the shipment of signs now, and I'd hate to keep people late on a Friday evening to hang them all up. So, if anyone gets this message, could you call me back, please? It's Glenn. Sir... Oh, sorry. Oh, oh, so sorry, sir. Sir, I can't quite... Oh, I am in the way. Yeah. Duty calls. Sorry. I can't seem to... There's a spot right over there. Yeah. Okay. Hey, is that "Die Hard 2"? That is the best "Die Hard." Have a heavenly night. ♪ ♪ Okay. Whoo Hoo! Oh, yeah! Yeah! Oh, great job, Mateo. Great job. Hey, we're all staying late to do more work. I'm so sorry. I just found out about it. I feel terrible about this. Whoo-hoo! [Upbeat music] I'm stuck at work for an hour or two, but save my seat. I'll be there as soon as I can. You have to get here, bitch. I know, bitch. Birds, it's Mommy. Listen up. Scout, Taffy, FDR, Pikachu, you guys are in charge, so act like the leaders I know that you are. Now, cockatoos, I assume you can't hear me right now since you should all be asleep already. [Cuckles] Okay, heads down. [Clears throat] ♪ Too la loo ra loo ral ♪ 
♪ Too la loo ra li ♪ Ooh, corporate messed up. Those are the same signs we just took down. I don't think so. Mm-Hmm. Nope, they say the old signs were this pale, outdated color called "Glossy Dolphin." The new ones are a bold, exciting color called "Glossy Dolphin B." [Scoffs] This is kind of fun, right? Being up high like this? Reminds me of my indoor rock-climbing days. I just need to get home to study for my midterm. Midterm. [Chuckles] That takes me back. Mm-hmm. Cramming for tests... or trying to. Half the time, I'd just end up getting drunk in someone's dorm room and spend the whole night having "deep conversations." [Laughs] That's so fun. Did I ever tell you the story about that one time when I went to college as a grown-up and I had to go work and I had all these responsibilities? It's a laugh riot. You don't have to hold the ladder, you know. I'm not gonna let you fall... not on my watch. What? [Drill buzzing] Oh, hey, look at that. Ooh. Ooh, cool move, cowboy. What, this? I was born with a drill in my hand. My family used to own a hardware store... Sturgis and Sons? Oh. Yeah, for 59 years, the name "Sturgis" was synonymous with tools... Well, until Cloud 9 moved in up the street, and then a month later, we lost everything. Hey, has anyone seen the laser level? Doesn't it make you a little angry to be working for them? Oh, I don't waste my time with anger. Oh. Look at that. I hit my finger. [Chuckles] That looked pretty serious. Did the lights go out? Oh, come on. Glenn, what's up with the lights? I'm kind of in a rush. Actually, the lights are controlled by corporate. What? Every night at a certain time, the lights dim, and the doors automatically lock. All the doors lock? Yep. Excuse me. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh, no, no, no, no. Are you kidding me? [Gunting] No! [Grunts] Oh, God. Okay, the bad news is we're locked in. Dina and I will go to my office and look for the lock override code. In the meantime, you guys keep putting up signs. You can make a game out of it. You can call the game "Signage Fever." I am not playing that game. Guys... No. You don't even know what I was gonna say. I know that every time you start a sentence with, "Guys," you end it with, "Let's make the best of this," or, "Let's have fun." You never say, "Guys, this really sucks." Guys, we have the entire store to ourselves. We could do whatever we want. If we decide that this is gonna be fun, then this is gonna be fun. So, if you're with me, I will see all of you in the fun zone. "Fun zone"? Sometimes I just really want to slap him. I think it was on one of these memos from corporate. Here. [Sighs] "Union buzzwords." "How to spot a union." "Anti-union activity." "What to do if you hear the word 'union.'" "Reporting union activity." "List of toxic food recalls"? I don't remember doing any food recalls. [Gasps] What? "Addendum of policy changes to employee handbook... Relationships between supervisors and subordinates no longer forbidden, now just strongly discouraged." Yeah, words. Oh, here it is. "Please detach the accompanying card and keep in a safe place." And, look, I wrote, "Like in your car," and then I underlined "car." Oh, that means it's just outsi... Oh. Okay, the bad news is I left the card with the code in my glove compartment. So I called my wife to come get it, but we only have one car, so she has to wait for her sister to come get her. You guys, there's someone out there. Oh, my God. Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh! [All shouting] Can you get something from my car? [Inaudible] All : Boop-boop-boop... We need a boop-boop-boop-boop. [Gunshots on television] Whoo! You guys are missing out. Mm. What a unique experience it must be, moving around a store on wheels. The key's above the tire. Get card from glove compartment. Bring card here. [Inaudible] [All cheering] Whoo! We're gonna get out of here! Yes! Yes! Is it there? Is it there? Wait, wait... oh, good. Look, he's got the key. Why is he getting in the driver's seat? No, you don't need to start the engine to open the glove compartment. No, you don't need to move the car. Wait. Where are you going? Where's he going? What the... where is the... Cruising through the fun zone... Hey, can you maybe... Whoo! Ha ha! Okay. Part of me's glad I missed the recital. I've been looking forward to my senior dance since sixth grade, and it would've sucked to just sit there and watch. I'm not saying that I regret this baby. I just wish that I'd had it later... or sooner, like a lot of my friends. You know what I mean? Uh, I do, yes, and I think each and every one of us has regrets. I'll go next. I regret doing Semester at Sea instead of just picking one country and really absorbing the culture. Who else? Well, my only regrets are the times I over thought things and didn't go for what I wanted. There you go. I mean, why fight nature? We're all just animals, right? I regret not rescuing my twin brother from that wave. So there you have it, guys. We are learning lots about each other. What about you, Ame? What are you... What's your biggest regret? I guess I regret not going to college when I was younger so that I could have lots of stories to annoy my coworkers with. Hey, well, at least it's quiet. We don't have to listen to that stupid Muzak they make us play. I actually kind of like the music. It makes me feel like I'm on hold all day. Glenn, you like everything about this store. That's weird, man. Well... I don't like everything about this store. Truth be told, the backslash in the employee's bathroom... It's, like, B-minus, at best. That's the only thing that bugs you about this company? Well, I guess the aisles are a bit too close together... and sometimes the folks in charge don't treat me like I'm a human being with feelings. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's a bummer. Sturgis and Sons was a community. Customers would be like, "Hi, Glenn. Do you have a screw in such-and-such a size?" And I'd say, "I think so. Maybe ask my dad." It was paradise. You know what else I regret? That time... 
 
 And then this chain moves in. I mean, where do they get off? Keep us late in... locked in the dark, you know, all in service of the bottom line. Yeah. Go. I hate this tie. Yeah. I hate this shirt! Okay. Isn't that his shirt? Oh, you're going a little too far now. And I hate Regional Manager Dicky Larson, but you know what I hate most of all? I hate Cloud 9. I hate Cloud 9. [Yells] What just happened? I think we broke Glenn. Oh, no, this is damaged. Guess we can't sell these. Right. It's a party, mother-fathers, sponsored by Sturgis and Sons... [Laughter] You, you, you, you, you, you... That was good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Never have I ever... Uh-huh. Stocked ice cream. Okay, but... You know, like that, but, like, a little more edgy. You know, like, not this, but, "Never have I ever eaten human flesh." Oh, no, no, no. You drink if you have done it. Mm-hmm. I understand. I have another one. Never have I ever hooked up in the store. Really? You remember last week when Jerusha came by to talk about the mortgage? Oh. In my office? Yeah, boy. Gross. Wait, wait. There's more. We had s*x. Yeah, man. Bo and I... photo lab... seven months ago. All : Oh. Oh, my god, the photo lab is a great spot. Yeah. What? Really? Yeah, it's dark. It's private. Sometimes you get to see people's naked photos. When I first started here, we just called the lab the "bang room" because, you know... the banging. [Softly] I banged in there. [Softly] Okay. Really? I did. So the photo lab, huh? Cool. Cool, cool. Attention, Cloud 9... This isn't working. You're not pushing the button. Oh. Attention, Cloud... [Feedback whines] Wow. I really suck at this. Yeah. ♪ It's goin' down for real♪

She doesn't seem to know what we're doing here, but she is owning it. Thank you, Myrtle. So, Amy, how are you feeling? I feel great. Oh, yeah?

Yeah. Uh, hmm. Uh, but, you know... alas, it is discouraged. Besides, the idea of dating my boss... Oof, I mean, the sexual politics are just so nuanced. Otherwise, believe me, I am... I would love to do... everything there is to do. I was not expecting that. Yeah. But I do understand. Oh, great. I mean, you know... Great. Okay, um... I'll see you out there. [Exhales sharply] Oh. Hey, what you doing up there? Looks like you might get hurt. You don't get to tell me what to do. I wasn't telling you what to do. You are not my boss. I am your boss, college boy. I just thought maybe... It's a little dangerous being... By the way, I got into college too... A good one... when I was 18. [Imitates explosion] That's great. I just got pregnant. And then I got married, and then Adam had dreams, and somebody had to pay the bills, so here I am, spinning around on this... endless... Oh, God. [Vomits] For what it's worth, that was shaping up to be a really nice metaphor. [Retches] Oh, I know. "Leave a message, and we'll never call you back." Well, that fig ain't gonna fly tonight, baby. This company's a sham. You lock us in. You control the music that we listen to. Oh, and try this on for size. The color difference in your signage is marginal. Oh, and you can tell Dicky Larson that he can suck my big, fat, sweaty toe. If you are satisfied with your message, press 1. To erase and re-record, press 2. Hey, guys, everything's great. Signs are all up... Really popping. [Groans] Come on. It's good for you. [Sighs] Glenn is right. This backslash is unremarkable. I don't regret getting married. I never said that you regretted getting... Yeah, but you were thinking it. Yeah, I wonder sometimes what it would've been like if I had made other choices, but... you want to know what I really regret? That last shot of Sambuca? [Scoffs] Forget it. You're the last person I should be telling this to. Wait. Why am I the last... [Vomits] This is a weird night. Okay. [Beeps] See ya. Ooh. Oh, it is good to be outside. I'm gonna go home and play some video games. I'm hungry. You want breakfast? My shift starts in 20. I can get you free coffee. Ooh, pancakes. I can't believe I have to take a midterm on zero sleep and totally hungover. College. [Scoffs] Yep, college. Glenn. Oh, thank God. I thought I was gonna have to hang these things by myself. I'm requesting a demotion... What? To associate level... personal reasons. Wha... wha... what? And, yeah, that's gonna be a two-person job. Why are you dressed like my mother?
