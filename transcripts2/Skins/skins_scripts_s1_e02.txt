 I think Michelle's parents are back today. 
 Bummer. 
 Do you think I should remind her? 
 I'm trying to pray to my god here, Cass. 
 Oh... wow... 
 Is he listening? 
 I hope not. 
 Otherwise he knows about all those pills I necked last night. 
 Sing quietly. 
 Yup...

 We do love a nomad, don't we, babe! 
 So have you been helping Michelle clear up? 
 Oh, wow, totally.

 Was it lost somewhere, nowhere to be found While money keeps making the world go round.

Stop crying! I am not an "expletive" bitch. I am your mother! Have you taken your medication? Well, take it now... Now! So... before you leave us to start your new life, it's important that you understand, um... Cassie. Cassie! That if you are troubled again, then you treat us as a place of safety and refuge. We like to think of Restoration as a big family you can re-visit any time it's necessary. Here's my card with the emergency number... Calls after six are double. We're all on your side. Providing you have arrangements in place for the fees. How does that sound? Lovely. I'm so grateful, really. Good. Thank you, Carrie. You may go to Group Congratulations. Dr Stock. Thank you so much.

No-one's staring at you, Madison. Are we? (Group) No... No... Now. What's been troubling you? I keep telling myself that maybe I'm a bit over-sensitive, you know, and it's... It's starting to work. There's no more... no more voices going, "Ba ba ba ba ba," no more voices whispering, you know, "Ba-ba..." And then... And then... Spit it out Madison. We're here for you, aren't we? (Group) We are... Perfectly straightforward business deal, right? This kid asks me for credit terms and I'm like... "trust"... Yeah? Well done, Madison.

He thinks... that he can get away with cheating me out of my money... Maybe he wasn't trying to cheat you, Madison. Oh, yeah? It's a misunderstanding. Really? We need you to work on this, Madison. Well, I'm working on it! I'm working on it. Er, chips, please. Few more. Just a few more. Cheers! Hi, Marnie. What are we? Pilchard. Cute. What we saying?

Bit of a hangover and... Yeah. There. Go on then. You gonna eat that? Oh, totally. I'm better now. I'm totally better. How do you do it? What? Come on, Cass. I mean you never eat anything. Your parents must notice or something. I dunno. I like you, Sid. OK. So I'm going to show you. You have to do a lot of talking. I'm good at talking. You do that while you're cutting things up a lot. Then, questions. Where's your Student Card? Sorry? Your ID, have you got it? No I, er, lost it somewhere last week. Change the subject. This is great. I love these sausages. You should try one.

You need advice? I need advice and 300 quid. Otherwise someone's going to be re-possessing my bollocks. OK, well look, when it comes to debt, the best thing to do is to face up to it before it gets out of hand. Yeah? Yeah. All you have to do is go to the person you owe money to and calmly ask them to reschedule the payments. Reschedule payments? So that's one ball now and then the balance next week. Believe me, Sid, I'm a responsible adult. I know. OK? Now what was it, a phone or something? Actually, Angie, it was three ounces of prime hydroponic skunk. sh1t! Yeah, sh1t. Go to the police.
