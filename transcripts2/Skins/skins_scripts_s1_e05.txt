 (Man shouts) Sid! 
 Yeah, sorry. It's just there was a... 
 Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about, Sid. 
 OK? Lack of concentration, inability to focus, nada commitment. 
 Now, this piece of coursework I have marked "ungraded". 
 Ungraded? What? 
 I can't pass him with this mark. 
 f*cking hell! 
 Mark... 
 Mark, please. With this mark... 
 Not you, Mark, this mark. 
 ...you have failed the entire year. 
 He's what? 
 He's failed the entire year. 
 Sod, you... sidding... idiot! 
 Ah, hold on, there's no need to panic. Because I fought for you, Sid, I really did, and got you an extension. 
 It was hard, but I worked at it, and I got it. 
 Right? 
 Got what right? 
 No, I got it. Right? 
 Thanks... Tom. 
 So... 2,000 words on Lech Walesa, Solidarity and the collapse of Soviet power. 
 Jesus Christ! 
 You've got two days. Get your head down. 
 You better f*cking believe he's getting his head down. 
 You can say goodbye to sunshine, Sunshine. You are grounded. 
 Put it this way. Let's change and develop. OK? 
 Thanks, Tom. We're all very grateful for this second chance. Aren't we, Mark? 
 Yes. Thank you very much. 
 Oh, yes, my boy! We're going to do this my way now! 
 You hear me? The gravy train has terminated! 
 Terminated! You lazy little fucker. 
 Mark! 
 Did Tony fail this? 
 No. 
 No, of course not! And why? Why didn't he fail it? 
 He doesn't do history. 
 Right! 
 You are going to get something... something right, if it's the last thing I ever do. What's your next class? 
 Drama... 
 Right. Drama. Home. Coursework. 
 f*cking perfection! Or else. 
 Honestly, Sid, you know this upsets people. 
 Sorry. 
 Just... give it a try, OK? 
 OK. 
 (Woman) OK, everyone. Everyone reach. 
 (Sid) Oh, Christ... 
 (Woman) Reach up. Stretch out your leaves. 
 (Maxxie) That looks so crap, doesn't it? 
 Go on. 
 f*ck that. 
 Why don't you go to the green and get stoned instead? 
 No. No, you mustn't. 
 That would be bad. Bad, do you hear? 
 And you're a good boy really. Good. Drama. f*ck it... be bad! 
 Be good. Drama! 
 f*ck it! 
 Drama... 
 Shut up... will you? 
 Pretty nice gear, huh? 
 Yeah, very funny. 
 Where you going? 
 I gotta go to this lesson. 
 f*ck it, man. 
 f*ck it? 
 f*ck it. 
 Yeah, let's go. 
 (Woman) Right, Donny, you fart once more and you're out. 
 Sid? 
 Hi. Wow, Maxxie, you look all horny. 
 You can tell? 
 Sid... I just wanted to remind you of our date tonight. 
 Oh... sh1t. 
 Thing is, Cass, my dad kinda grounded me. 
 I gotta do coursework. 
 Oh, wow. 
 I was really... 
 I didn't eat for three days so I could be lovely. 
 Er, sorry. 
 Maybe I'll come over and say hello. 
 I dunno. Maybe. 
 Safe. 
 Wow. 
 (Maxxie) Go on, give her one. 
 That would be so bad! 
 (Anwar) I bet she bangs like a ferret on acid! 
 CHURCH BELLS CHIME Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I didn't know which one to get. They were both so pretty. 
 Anyway, I got them both. 
 What do you think? Which skirt? This goes with my slutty green top. 
 This one is more virgin. 
 Yeah? 
 Tony? Which skirt? 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, yeah, it's nice. 
 Are you listening? I'm asking what to wear to Tribe Of Frog tomorrow? 
 Did you ask Chris about pills? 
 We can have Mitsubishis. 
 Is that OK, Tone? 
 Tone? 
 Wear that one to Tribe Of Frog, and that one to my choir concert. 
 Choir concert? When? 
 Tonight. 
 You and Sid are coming to hear me sing. 
 Are we? How come? 
 It just occurred to me how much fun it could be. 
 Russia... was... a... Superpower... 
 ...and... 
 Er... Lech Walesa... was a... 
 ...Polish... Er... 
 ...man... who... 
 What the f*ck did he do? Erm... 
 Bollocks. 
 SQUEAKING CAR APPROACHES f*ck it. 
 CLATTERING Right, you have been warned! 
 Oh, yes, I warned you! This is what happens. 
 No telly. 
 No stereo. 
 No... Asian Fanny Fun. 
 That should be enough to help you concentrate. Is it?! 
 Yes, Dad. 
 Yes. Thank you. 
 You'll thank me for this one day. 
 Oh! Oh, f*ck! 
 CLATTERING 
 Ow! 
 (Woman) What's happened? 
 I've fallen down the f*cking stairs, you silly cow! 
 Bugger. 
 HE SIGHS Ah, for f*ck's sake. 
 Ah, yeah. That's better. 
 Oh, yeah. Ah, yeah. 
 I'm just gonna go out and come back in again. OK? 
 Would you? 
 (Oh, f*ck!) 
 KNOCK AT DOOR Hello. 
 It's Tony! 
 Yeah, er, come in! 
 All right, Sid? Thought you might need a hand. 
 With your coursework. Shall we let some air in here? 
 Yeah. 
 That's better. Is that a picture of my girlfriend? 
 Wondered where that went. 
 Right then. 
 Russia... Lech Walesa... 
 Jesus, Sid. 
 The USSR model could be described as a relationship of control and manipulation, but events in the G... 
 Gdansk. 
 ...shipyard in the autumn of 1980 was the beginning of a... 
 That's some really good bullshit. 
 Not a problem. OK, let's go. 
 Where to? 
 My choir concert. 
 Don't tell me you forgot. 
 I can't. I'm grounded. 
 Don't be such a f*cking v*g1n*. This is gonna be special. 
 Anyway, I need someone to keep Michelle company. 
 Michelle's coming? 
 Oh, yes. Nips'll be there. 
 And you'll wanna see this. Trust me. 
 Sorry about that. You won't tell her, will you? 
 She thinks the world of you, Sid. Really. 
 And things run their course. You get bored. 
 Are you gonna tell me what you're talking about? 
 You'd better be doing some f*cking work. Hi, Tony. How's things? 
 Not bad, Mark. Is that landfill survey finished? I'd really love to see it sometime. 
 Yeah, no problem. Yeah. 
 Actually, it's quite an interesting analysis of decomposition rates. 
 But look, actually, er, Sid's got some work to do now, so... 
 OK. Hope to see you very soon, Sid. 
 Nice to see you, Mark. 
 Bye, Liz! 
 Bye, Tony! 
 What? 
 Why could you not be like... 
 Why did I? 
 Ow!

And you can f*ck off, too! Well... Michelle. I'm just wondering why you're overreacting like this. Overreacting?! Right in my face, you whore! You know, typically, episodes of paranoia might be symptomatic of a wide range of emotional and mental issues. Maybe, you know, you need some help with the outbursts. My mother's a psychologist, she could... Oh! Ow! I'll kill you, you f*cking flat-chested cocksucking spastic horse-fucker! Woah, good swearing. Bye, Tony. Later, Nips. Abi, wonder if you could give me and Sid a minute. Yes... I need my medication. See, told you it'd be worth coming for. Looks like me and 'Chelle are on a break. You did that on purpose? - Go after her. What? Life throws up so few opportunities... But she's your girlfriend. Who you love. What? Change. It's a wonderful thing. Look, you know how subatomic particles don't obey physical laws? They act according to chance, chaos, coincidence... They run into each other in the middle of the universe, and, bang! Energy. We're the same as that. That's the great thing about the universe. Unpredictable. That's why it's so much fun. I'm... just gonna go see if she's OK, all right? Sid. Bang! Michelle would never... never f*ck a horse.
