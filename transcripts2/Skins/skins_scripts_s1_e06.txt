 CHIME 
 (Man) Ladies and gentlemen, the seatbelt light has been switched off. 
 You are now free to move around the cabin. 
 We've reached cruising altitude and are flying over the French Alps. 
 Sorry, man. 
 It's nothing to do with you! It's the vibrations, innit? 
 Mm, yeah. 
 f*ck off, homo. 
 You gonna be this horny the whole trip? 
 Just wait till we get there. Oh, man. 
 Those Russian peasant babes will do anything for some Levi's and a Big Mac! 
 OK, everyone. Listen up. 
 Right, I want you all to remember that this is not a holiday, OK? 
 This is your chance to nail your module one history coursework - post-Soviet industrial Russia. 
 It's a chance of a lifetime, gang. 
 Whoopee(!) 
 Now, this isn't just education, yeah? It's total education. 
 Total piss up. 
 Uh, no, no, no, no. There'll be no "piss up", OK? 
 We're gonna work hard, understanding the culture and history of Mokshovkov in the Mordovian Republic of the Russian Federation. 
 OK? We're gonna see the real Russia, yeah? 
 The wild and desolate land that Napoleon and Hitler failed to tame. 
 This is adventure, yeah? This is living, breathing history. 
 Who's with me? 
 Thank you, sir. I was addressing history students only. 
 This trip will blow their minds, and yours. 
 Great. 
 Oi, An, An. Where'd you hide the drugs, then? 
 I thought you were bringing them. 
 No. You were gonna put 'em in your turban. 
 I don't wear a turban, Chris. 
 I thought you were gonna get one especially! 
 Don't panic, boys. We've got a back-up plan. 
 Urgh, not up his arse?

 Trip leader. Let me through.
