 (Mark) Sid, can you get yourself down here?! 
 f*ck! 
 f*cking hell. 
 You'd better help me here or...!  
 All right! 
 All right. 
 Oh, come on, work, you f*cking thing! 
 Hit the video button. 
 Sid! 
 We can talk. 
 Come on, you ditzy moo, it's the big f*cking red button marked "video". 
 Sid, I need your help! 
 For Christ's sake! 
 Sidney!  
 Big f*cking red button! 
 There you are! 
 Hey, sexy! 
 Oh, Jesus Christ! 
 Cass. 
 Cass? 
 What the f*ck is a ratchet lock? 
 Yes, you do, turn on your sodding speakers! Cass. 
 Sid, what are you?! 
 Is it not working? 
 (Cassie) No. 
 Huh? 
 Sid. For Christ's sake. You made me buy that frigging Dyson and I can't make the pissing thing... 
 Oh, that's... 
 That's... 
 My girlfriend. 
 Right. 
 So, she's in Scotland and... 
 She doesn't know I can see her. 
 Right. 
 Because... 
 Oh, f*ck, no! 
 RAPID CLICKING f*ck, f*ck! 
 f*ck! 
 What do you think? 
 s*x on a stick, so you are. 
 Thanks, Lachlan. 
 But the pink one ain't bad either. Eh, no, Ruiri? 
 Aye. He's a lucky, lucky gadge, this Sidney. 
 He's lovely! 
 I'm going to surprise him. 
 Look at this. 
 Help ma boab! Nice. 
 f*cking A. 
 You think he'll like it? 
 Jings, you're almost turning me straight here! 
 Love is in the air! Eh, no, Ruiri? 
 I'm feelin' it, man. I'm feelin' it. 
 It's one of those things, sh1t happens. 
 Is that the best you've got, Dad? 
 You always get my best, son. 
 Because she's... 
 Well, she says she loves me, then she waltzes off to Elgin, now she's f*cking the Scottish rugby team! 
 No. She's only f*cking one of them. 
 Stop trying to console me. I'm inconsolable, ok? 
 Ok, ok! It's just... 
 It's just women, you know? 
 Hang on, are we comparing women here? 
 I don't know. 
 Mum left you because you were a total, world championship cretin. 
 I'm not sure that that's... 
 Mine's done this cos I'm a gullible soft-touch who's far, far, far too f*cking nice for his own good. 
 There's no comparison, ok? 
 But you worked it out though. 
 Didn't you? 
 What is this thing?! 
 "Attach the guide nozzle to the flange circulator?" What the f*ck?! 
 sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t! 
 Dad... 
 Your mother'll be here in a minute. We've gotta get this... 
 We've gotta clear it up. And maybe... 
 She's not coming back because you tidied the house, Dad. 
 Yeah? Yeah? Oh, please. Something work. 
 What time's your Dad arriving? 
 12. 
 We can do it, if we concentrate. 
 I thought he hated you. 
 Who said my dad hates me? 
 Well, you did, didn't you? 
 He's not well. We've got a few issues. 
 DOORBELL RINGS f*ck! 
 We should have started earlier! 
 We should have started earlier! 
 Hey! 
 Anwar. 
 How you doing, man? 
 I'm not too good, as it goes, actually. 
 Right. I just thought I'd pop round, wonder if you're busy. 
 In the bedroom department. 
 Huh? 
 Your bedroom, is it currently in use? 
 My mum's coming so she can pretend to still be married to my dad for my granddad. 
 But this won't take long. 
 What? 
 This is Sketch. 
 Yeah, I know who she is. She stalked Maxxie, she got our drama teacher wrongly fired for sexual abuse and she tried to poison Michelle. 
 Yes. 
 Sketch! 
 I've come to my senses. 
 She's sorry. 
 Boy, she's sorry. 
 Thing is, Sid, s*x hasn't been invented yet round at my place. 
 Tricky with 2,000 years of religious tradition. 
 So me and Sketch were wondering if we could... 
 Come on. My whole family's gonna be here in an hour. 
 It won't take long. 
 It never takes long. 
 You don't mind do you, Sidney? 
 I do, actually, you know, I... 
 Oh, whatever. 
 Das ist gut, ja? 
 Oh, yes, Manfred. It's lovely, but I've got to go. 
 Thanks for the lift. 
 But you will hurry, and tonight, we will have much more great s*x, ja? 
 Ja. I mean, yes, yes. 
 Oh-h-h! Yikes! 
 You are liking it like that, huh? 
 Oh, f*ck... 
 Oh, f*cking hell. 
 I've got to go. I've really, really got to go. 
 Jesus wept. Does she have to do that? 
 I mean, what kind of a fucked-up relationship is it where you have to jump each other every time you say goodbye? 
 A good one? 
 (Mark) Jesus. 
 Jesus, Je... Bollocks! 
 CLEARS THROAT Hi, Sid. 
 Hi, Mum. 
 Mark. 
 Liz. 
 Oh, you all right, Sid? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 You smell of something. 
 Um... 
 It's just Opium. You know, perfume. 
 You hate perfume. 
 Manfred likes it. 
 Oh! I'm sure Manfred f*cking loves it. 
 I'm sure Manfred loves rolling into Belgium, rounding up the Jews and sending them to Poland, but hey, that's Blitzkrieg for you, and Manfred's gotta have his Opium-scented Lebensraum. Right? 
 He can't help being German. 
 Who can? 
 Right, perhaps I should go home. 
 You should come home. 
 This is gonna be so silly. 
 Why on earth did you tell your father that we were together again? 
 After that night, you know, when you stayed... 
 Oh. 
 But that was just... 
 I mean, you stayed and we... I thought... 
 You... 
 You stayed? 
 It was just one time. 
 Oh. 
 You know how the old b*st*rd loves you. 
 I never got round to telling him you were just f*cking with my head. 
 Right, that's it. I'm going. 
 (Both) No! 
 Liz... 
 I can't make the sodding Hoover work. 
 Oh, for Christ's sakes. 
 Sid, load the dishwasher. Have you hidden your cigarettes? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 VACUUM CLEANER WHIRRS MUFFLED THUMPS RHYTHMIC KNOCKING Oh, God. 
 (Anwar) The Godfather, The Godfather Part II... 
 ...Apocalypse Now, the Conversation... 
 It's not working. 
 VACUUM CLEANER OFF 
 (Sketch) You need some staying power. 
 Oh, God. 
 (Sketch) Don't you dare, boyo. I am far, far from satisfied. 
 Ok. Oh... sh1t. Ahhh... 
 Oh, f*cking hell. 
 CLEARING THROAT Hello, Mrs Jenkins. 
 Hello, Anwar. 
 Um... 
 This is Sketch. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Sid didn't mention you were back. 
 Yes, I'm not staying. 
 Mum, you don't need to... I can tidy my own... 
 Oh... sh1t! 
 Hmm! Just having a lovely chat with Anwar and his, um, new friend. 
 How's your mum, Anwar? I must give her a ring some time. 
 Yeah, yeah, she's fine, she's fine. 
 She's fine, yeah, but, you know... 
 Muslim. 
 She's been a bit busy Muslim... 
 (Anwar) Yeah... 
 She doesn't know I have s*x. 
 Really? Well... 
 Anyway... 
 Make sure you come again soon, Anwar. 
 Yeah, cheers. 
 Chance would be a fine thing. 
 Isn't this nice? 
 Yeah. 
 Nice. 
 How's Cassie? 
 Still missing you, I bet. 
 Actually, no. 
 I don't think she's missing me at all. 
 Really? How's that? 
 Oh, the usual. Woman dumps him for no good reason without even explaining herself, falls into bed with some random idiot with a big cock, you know the kind of thing. 
 That's rotten, Sid. I'm sorry. 
 I haven't been keeping up properly. 
 No. 
 I could explain, but it wouldn't make any difference. 
 To me it would. 
 You heard him. It would help if you explained. 
 I mean, we're all here. Let's explain. 
 DOORBELL RINGS Bloody hell. He's early! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Later, ok? 
 Liza! 
 How are you, Alex? 
 Och, embracing adversity as ever, my dear. 
 But borne aloft by the sight of you, lassie. 
 Hi, Dad. 
 You're going grey. What've ye been doing? 
 Nothing. 
 Where's my drink? 
 Sandy! What a nice surprise. 
 Aye, I ken it is, eh, no? 
 Ah! 
 You've brought the boys. 
 They've been fair jumpin' wi' excitement, ken, aye? 
 Right... Hello, Lex. 
 Hello, Ally. 
 It's nice. 
 How's the work? 
 It's fine. 
 Interesting? 
 Sometimes. 
 What is it you do? 
 Strategic analyst, Dad. Ok? 
 Aye. 
 Well... done any good, um... analysing recently? 
 I do my best. 
 Well... as long as you've done your best. 
 Aye, that's the main thing, Da. 
 That's the main thing. 
 PHONE RINGS Who's that? 
 Nobody. 
 And... Sidney... 
 Uh? 
 You still in the school, boy? 
 Oh, A-levels, you know? 
 A-levels? I hear they make them nice and easy for you down here. 
 What? 
 Subjects? 
 Um, English, drama and psychology. 
 Psychology? It's piss easy. 
 No need o' psychology when you're staring doon the sights o' a Stinger missile, ken, aye? 
 Maybe Sidney is gonna be a... strategic analyst like his father. 
 I might, if my grades are good enough. 
 Never rated grades. Few years in the Paratroopers like Sandy here, that's wisdom. 
 Aye. You learn early. You learn hard. 
 So now he's taking over the business. 
 He's what? 
 I'm standing aside... because of my illness. 
 The doctors are shaking their heads. Nae idea. 
 Pure phenomenal, Da. 
 It's will. Iron will! 
 Guts. Determination. 
 Never say die, and here I have it. 
 My legacy. 
 Sandy? Sandy's gonna run 12 dry-cleaning shops? 
 Seventeen. 
 Bathgate is opening up. City of the future. 
 I'm leaving the business in safe hands. 
 Is that what you've come to tell me? 
 Och, no. Wouldnae have bothered coming all that way for... 
 No, I'm buying a wee holiday place in Devon for Sandy and the weans here. 
 Nothing too fancy. 
 1.7 million, ken, aye. 
 Small change. Ye cannae put too high a price on loyalty, eh, no Liza? 
 No, Alex. But my names's not... 
 Liza, you're a saint. 
 A good cook is a saint. 
 And she's a saint for taking pity on you. 
 She took you back. 
 SIGHING Lucky. 
 So... 
 Do you wanna go on the swing? 
 Slide? 
 Spliff? 
 No? Say anything you like doing. Anything at all. 
 Fitba. 
 You what? 
 Fitba. 
 Oh! 
 Think I've got one... 
 Used to... Aha! 
 Football! 
 Not too good at this. 
 How about I go in goal and? 
 Square go! 
 Aargh! 
 Ya b*st*rd! 
 Stick the heid on him! 
 SID GROANS SOBBING Ow! 
 Hold still. 
 Will I tell him what we used to do to bullies in the desert, pal? 
 But... I didn't. 
 I'm sure it was an accident, Sandy. 
 We used to tie them to the bonnet o' the Saracen, roast their bollocks for a couple o' hours, ken, aye. 
 You'll never dance the f*cking samba again. 
 That's enough. 
 Aye, Da. 
 Sidney's sorry. Aren't ye, son? 
 Yes. 
 There you go. Sorted like men. 
 Now, if you'll just tell us where we're sleeping, hen. 
 Wait a minute! 
 You're staying? 
 Couple of days. Three, tops. 
 Don't want to put you out. 
 
 
 
 PUMP WHIRRS 
 Look. 
 Listen to me... 
 I am not sleeping with you just cos your f*cking dad's here! 
 I had no idea they were staying. 
 Why don't you stand up to him? Tell him. 
 I can't. He's dying for Christ's sake! 
 Oh! I'm going home. 
 Tell me there's not a part of you that wants to stay with me tonight. 
 Mark... 
 You're not good for me. 
 Tell me you don't love me. 
 Go on. Tell him you don't love him. Then you can f*cking stop this. Ok? 
 PHONE RINGS Answer it. 
 Hello. No, I'm still here. 
 Yes, well, it's a bit difficult. 
 No, I'm sorry, Manfred. I meant to text, but... Don't! 
 No. No, of course not. 
 SHOUTING ON PHONE Oh, Manfred. 
 Manfred! 
 You're not coming round! 
 No. No! 
 Mark! Mark! 
 Yes, Dad. 
 I cannae get hot water. 
 What? You have to jiggle the thing. 
 Then fix it, man. What's wrong with you? 
 I haven't had the time. 
 Time? 
 Time?! 
 How long does it take to strip down a shower unit? Minutes! 
 Da! Da! It's ok. 
 Sorted. Some eejit forced the pressure regulator. 
 Aye... 
 So... 
 I'm going. I'm going to bed. 
 Goodnight. 
 Handsome young lassie, always said that. 
 Och, aye. She's steamy. CHUCKLING I hope I can sleep tonight in that bed. 
 A man in my condition. 
 Night, bro. 
 Alex, Sandy, Lex, Ally. 
 Kinda weird. 
 They're all called Alexander. 
 Yup. 
 Except you. 
 Except me. 
 Why don't you stand up to him? 
 Dad's always been ill. 
 What with? 
 It's, er... 
 I don't actually know. 
 I think every time I see him, it's gonna be the last time and... 
 You can't take chances with that. 
 He calls you stupid and useless and crap. 
 My father's disappointed. They often are. 
 Is that how you see me? 
 Never. 
 I'm useless and crap. 
 I f*ck everything up and it drives you mad. 
 You hear me, Sid? 
 Never. 
 Make her stay. 
 RINGING TONE RINGING TONE RINGING TONE RINGING TONE Mark. 
 Get into bed. 
 I'll probably never change that much. 
 Don't talk. 
 Just do something. 
 I want you to do some... 
 Oh, ja... ist gut! 
 What?! 
 Nothing. 
 RINGING TONE RINGING TONE Sid? 
 Sid, you there? 
 I found the button. 
 Sid? 
 I can see you! 
 Wow! That's so cool. 
 I could f*cking see everything you were doing. 
 What? 
 Oh, God! No, that was... 
 I'm such a tit. 
 Sid? 
 I just thought... I'm so stupid. Nothing ever works out, does it? 
 Nobody ever waits. Nobody ever loves anyone properly, do they? 
 You've got it wrong, Sid. 
 Just leave me alone. 
 You rang me! 
 All right. All right! 
 Don't you trust me, Sid? 
 No. I don't trust you. 
 You're up there, f*cking Oor f*cking Wullie or whoever the f*ck it is and... 
 I can't talk to you. 
 f*ck! f*ck! 
 DISTANT CAR REVS BRAKES SQUEAL sh1t!

 You are saying, he is ein plinker! 
 Plonker. 
 Right... 
 I was angry. 
 It's fine. 
 Manfred, you're bleeding. I'm going to take you to hospital. 
 I feel nothing! Nothing... 
 I'll call you in a couple of days. 
 I need time to think. Ok? 
 Manfred? Manfred? Raus! 
 We're going to hospital. 
 GROANING AND MUMBLING Cannae hold on to your woman, eh? 
 f*ck off out of my house, you miserable Scottish c**t. 
 You... You, you... what?! 
 I know what your game is, Alex. 
 It's a f*cking good yin, but I'm no' buying it, you got me? 
 (Sid) Dad? 
 It's ok, Sid. They're all leaving! 
 Right now! 
 HE SIGHS Ok? 
 Yep. 
 I think I dumped Cassie. 
 She's with some guy. 
 They're always with some guy. 
 If they're special, you just have to make sure that that guy... is you. 
 All right? 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 No problem, son. 
 HUMMING "FLOWER OF SCOTLAND" 
 PIANO PICKS UP TUNE BIRDS SING Little Scottish bastards. 
 (Sid) Hey, Cassie. Everything was a bit weird. 
 Look, I'm sorry about last night. 
 Er, we need to talk now. 
 Everything's... 
 Jesus, the f*cking signal in this house! 
 RINGING TONE 
 'Sorry. The user has blocked your call.' 
 Idiot! 
 Ah, f*ck! 
 Dad? 
 Dad? 
 You sure you're ok with that, Tony? 
 It's fine. Give me a sec. 
 Maybe you should take it easy, mate. 
 Jesus, Chris, maybe you should take it easy! 
 Nah. Angie's coming back today. I'm a bit... 
 She's been in touch? 
 Not as such. 
 But I know she still loves me, of course. 
 Chris. She's your psychology teacher. It was just a fling. 
 No, it wasn't. Ok? She needed her space. 
 Right, and now I really need her naked, buffed, gagging and slippy in my bed, because... 
 You know, four months without s*x, that ain't funny. 
 You probably wouldn't understand that, Jal. 
 Huh? 
 You don't have s*x at all, do you? You have clarinet lessons. 
 I do... I mean, I have had... 
 Look, we're not counting fapping here, Jal, right, cos if we were, I'd have had s*x 14 times in two days. 
 I haven't had s*x for... a long time. 
 Right. Ok, in summary then, we all need some pussy action. 
 And I shall be getting mine tonight with the lovely Angela. 
 Hey, you all right Sid? 
 You two still not talking? 
 He stopped coming round. 
 Tony, he sat with you for months. 
 He read f*cking Anna Karenina to you. 
 I don't remember. He must have stopped. 
 Mate. 
 Hey, Sid. Do your coursework? 
 No... 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 (Teacher) Morning! All right. Yes, quickly please. 
 First of all, I've had a word with the Imam at Redcliffe Mosque about the school musical last month. 
 I explained that it was all meant to be ironic and he was very understanding. 
 He's not exactly sure who imposed the fatwa, but it wasn't him. 
 Probably somebody in Iran. 
 So what a relief. 
 And secondly, I have to inform you that Angela will not be returning to teach psychology at the college. 
 She's sent me this message. 
 "Dear everyone. I'll never forget you and hope "you all do great in the A2s." 
Well, that's nice, isn't it? 
 And I don't quite understand this. 
 "Tell Monkeyman I'll miss the spaghetti." Anyone? 
 In the meantime, I'll be doing my best. 
 Biology, psychology, is there really any difference? 
 So folders open, and let's make a start on... 
 Loss! Oh, fantastic! 
 So what do we all know about loss? 
 FLOOR CLEANER WHIRRS Sid? 
 I didn't know what to do. So I came to college. 
 What's happened? 
 Everyone says you looked after me when I was... iconic. 
 Intimate. 
 f*ck! f*ck! 
 III... 
 I mean, ill. 
 I just can't remember you. 
 I reckon it was pretty scary. 
 I know why you stopped coming. I would have, too. 
 It was so awful. 
 You were so awful. 
 That bus f*cked you up so bad, Tone. 
 I just couldn't... 
 I know. 
 What's happened? 
 I can't say it. 
 I know how that feels. 
 Let's go for a drink. 
 Sid? 
 Fading pictures of what I never saw Show me the way to what I'm looking for But what I see, yeah I see it just doesn't exist no more It's a long way down to get to the top But I'll keep going, yeah, I'll never stop Because I know Yeah, I know just what I'm here for I'm just another man with something up his sleeve And I'll do what I can to let you see what I see And I don't know why You always start to cry when the sun comes up Saying you want to survive We'll keep on going, yeah 
 SONG ENDS, CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Tony! Hi! Tony! 
 Oh. Hi, Abi. 
 Aren't we so kicking? 
 James says he wants me to sing lead on his next song he writes because I'm like totally Performance Art. 
 Anyway, I bet you can't wait to take me home tonight, yah? 
 I'm with Sid. 
 You wouldn't desert your girlfriend, ok? 
 You're not his girlfriend. 
 Well, actually I don't think you get to decide that, Sidney. 
 Tony loves Michelle. 
 They're having a few problems. He can't remember stuff well. 
 I know whatever you've told him is a total lie. 
 So f*ck off and leave him alone. Ok? 
 Tony! You remember? 
 I have nipples like creme caramels, yah? 
 Sid says I love Michelle. 
 No! You... You... 
 I'll be back. 
 (MC) The moment you've all been waiting for. Crystal Castles. Yeah!

 I think so. 
 I don't know what I'm supposed to do to him. 
 Ring someone. 
 I can't, they'll come. 
 They'll all f*cking come. 
 Do you think he'd mind? 
 He was so happy. 
 My mum. 
 Oh, Christ. 
 Ok. 
 Dad? 
 What do I do? 
 KEYPAD TONES Mum? 
 A world away from me A world away A word, a ransom On the day that you were born All the birds flew from the corn And the sky grew grey On the night you left home A crack appeared in the dome And it rained all day This is what you will wear to the end of the world This is what you will wear to the end of the world A world away from me A world away A word, a ransom This is what you will wear...
