 [SPLASH!] 
 [VOICES] 
 Excuse me, outta my way! Excuse me! 
 Dr. Claw : Simmer down, you nincompoops. 
 Sorry Dr. Claw... they started... 
 Enough! 
 Allow me to welcome you to MAD's most luxurious and dangerous cruise submarine: the Loathe Boat! 
 Yes! Even evil geniuses need a vacation! 
 Now please enjoy all the onboard doomsday device amenities! 
 [Evil Laughter] 
 Magical! 
 Abraca-BOOM! 
 Even though the sub is a state of art Super Villain getaway, it also happens to be our newest weapon! 
 It's got a combination sun-snuffing, Earth-core-destroying, black-hole creating weapon system! 
 [BOOM!] 
 Talk about convenient. 
 Uh, yeah, I know... 
 I'm the one who designed it. 
 I must sign off now, as I have a, uh... 
 [AHEM] 
 Bowling tournament. To attend. 
 For now, feel safe in the hands of my evil representative. 
 Huh? 
 [SCREECH] 
 [ALARMS] 
 What have you done? 
 [YOWLS] 
 Abandon sub! MAD MADgicians first! 
 Bad MADcat! 
 All those cat-submarine captain lessons... wasted! WASTED! 
 [SIGHS] 
 Anyhoo, onto the next evil plan. 
 What about that evil balloon idea? 
 [ZAP] 
 I am NOT losing my submarine! 
 Retrieve it, Talon. 
 Hey! MADcat sank it! She should... 
 [LASERS ZAP] 
 Okay, you win! 
 [HORN HONKS] 
 Thanks for the underwater-training, Uncle Gadget! 
 No problem, Penny. 
 If I can't share my HQ Naval Academy know-how with my niece, who can I share it with? 
 Wowzers! A whale! 
 Back in HQ Naval Academy, I majored in Whale Song! 
 With a minor in Sting Ray Stings! 
 Go Go Gadget Whale Talk! 
 We come in peace. 
 [WHALESONG] 
 [GROANS] 
 Whoa! 
 Hmm. Communication breakdown. 
 Go Go Gadget Whale Talk. 
 Thank you for the love, but we have to go now. 
 [WHALE SONG] 
 [WHIMPERS] 
 There there. Don't worry, we can still be friends! 
 [WHALE SONG] 
 [GIGGLE] 
 Oh hello there, Chief! 
 Out for another treasure hunt, I see. 
 Hm... 
 Wowsers! 
 Whoa, Chief. You're a magician! 
 MAD's technologically advanced, luxury submarine, has just sunk about two kilometers from here. 
 Your mission: raise the sub and bring it to HQ before MAD recovers it for themselves. 
 This message will self-destruct. 
 On it Chief! 
 Hm, now let me give it a try. 
 Abracawowsers! 
 [BOOM] 
 [MUFFLED GROAN] 
 Now, what does MAD want with a luxury submarine? 
 Good question, Penny. 
 But a better question is... what would MAD want with a luxury submarine? 
 Looks like we got some stowaways... 
 There's no sign of power. 
 I went down with dozens of ships at the Naval Academy... 
 So I know how to get this one working again. 
 First, we need to find the controls. 
 Should be right... here! 
 [WHOOOSH] 
 [BRAIN PANTING] 
 If I know my ships, and they know me, then pressing buttons will get this sub up in no time. 
 Go Go Gadget Button Locator! 
 I think someone else is here. 
 Brain! 
 This ship is highly unstable, try to keep Uncle Gadget safe while I poke around. 
 Whoa! 
 Ah!... 
 Oh, nice Penny. 
 Way to not alert anyone that you're here. 
 Yep, you'd probably lose pretty quick in a game of hide and seek. 
 [SPLAT-SPLAT] 
 Gotta be quicker than that, Talon. 
 Time for you to walk the plank. 
 What? 
 Okay, so we don't have a plank. 
 You get the point. 
 I'd say you gotta work on that aim! 
 Gotta work on my aim, huh? 
 Well you make a perfect target practice. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Hanging loose I see, Penny. 
 Hm... Here we are. 
 Go Go Gadget Panel Opener! 
 Wowsers! 
 How do you expect this submarine to float with all these wires? 
 [ZAP] 
 [WHIRR] 
 I can [ZAP] feel the submarine [ZAP] starting to work! [ZAP] 
 Whoa! 
 Go Go Gadet Scuba! 
 That sub was right here, wasn't it? 
 MAD must have cloaked it! 
 [GROWLS] Wowsesrs! He looks like a friendly fellow. 
 Maybe he can tell us where the sub is. 
 Go Go Gadget Squid Speak! 
 [SQUID NOISES] 
 [CRUNCH] 
 He says it's this way. 
 You totally wish you had a pair of magnetic boots right about now, don't you. 
 You can play with your toys. 
 I've got a sub to float. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Right behind you. 
 [STRUGGLES] 
 Maybe a little too magnet-y. 
 [STRUGGLING] 
 If I were the Control Room, where would I be? 
 There you are! 
 That complicates things. 
 Talon : Maybe for you! 
 See you when I dock this baby at the MAD Sub Club. 
 They have really good chicken fingers! 
 Aha, cannonball! 
 [SPLASH] 
 You're not the only one with a scuba suit. 
 Thank you Professor Von Slickstein! 
 I'm not letting you get away with this easily, Talon. 
 Hm, power's still out. 
 Go Go Gadget Flashlight. 
 Whoa! 
 This submarine certainly has some strange upgrades... 
 [GROWLS] 
 Whoa! 
 [BEEPS] Oh, wait. Not now! 
 Dr. Claw : Talon... 
 I know that going for a swim is really good for cardio, but I WANT MY SUB BACK NOW! 
 (muffled) Gotta cut the fun short, Penny. Uncle C's a-waitin'! 
 But I brought something to keep you company! 
 He's got an electrifying personality. 
 (LAUGHS) Yeah, I went there. 
 Huh? 
 (muffled) AN ELECTRIFYING PERSONALITY... 
 Huh? 
 (muffled) Ah, forget it. 
 [SQUEALING] 
 How does all this stuff fit in his bracer? 
 [HAMMERING] 
 They sure made this thing airtight... 
 Must be a design flaw. 
 Go go Gadget Laser! 
 [ZZZZAP] 
 [WHOOOSH] 
 Whoa! 
 [EEL SQUEALING] 
 I really hope this works! 
 [FIZZLES OUT] 
 Looks like my toys beat your toys, Talon... 
 Did you have fun with my friend? 
 The Control Panel has sparked out. 
 This sub ain't going anywhere. 
 That's my problem. This is yours. 
 [BUZZ] 
 [SHOCKS] 
 [SCREAMS] 
 You can have this sunken piece of junk! 
 Cannonball! 
 [SPLASH] 
 Got Talon, and the panel working. 
 Two birds with one Eel! We just need a good jolt to get us going. 
 Maybe if I give it a running start. 
 Full REVERSE! 
 [WHIRRR] 
 Penny! I think this sub is taking on water. 
 Yet another design flaw! 
 It's not going anywhere. 
 We need some kind of boost, and quick! 
 [GASP] 
 I know! Uncle Gadget! 
 Hit us up with some of that awesome whalesong! 
 I can never turn down a request. 
 Go Go Gadget Whale Song! 
 [SINGING] ♪ Go go go go go, Gadget, go. ♪ 
♪ Go go go go go Gadget Gadget, ♪ 
♪ Go Go Go Go Gadget Gadget Go... ♪ 
 [WHALESONG] 
 We did it! The Sub is moving! 
 Whoa! 
 Hooray! 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa! 
 [WHALE MOANS] 
 [SQUEE-SPLASH] 
 Great work, Gadget. 
 Von Slickstein's scanners shows that the Submarine should be able to hold on and make it to HQ! 
 Thanks Chief. 
 My naval training really came in handy this time. 
 [GROAN] 
 [SIGH] 
 
 
 
 [SLURPS] 
 Mmmm, MADcat, you should really try this quinoa yam kale smoothie. 
 Ooh, it's the bomb. 
 Surprise, Surprise. You failed AGAIN Talon. 
 Did you at least.. salvage something?! 
 Sort of... 
 [SCREAMS] 
 [MADCAT SNICKERS] 
 Next time Gadget, next time! 
 And hold... and release. 
 Now remember, yoga keeps you limber and centered. 
 Perfect training for agents of any age! 
 And don't worry if you make any sounds, it's aaaaaall natural. 
 [FARTS] 
 ...uh... 
 Wowzers! 
 Penny, what are you and Brain doing in the bathroom? 
 Uhhh... This isn't the bathroom, Uncle Gadget. 
 We're doing a yoga class. 
 It just so happens I'm an expert at yoga! 
 That's great. 
 Now if you could juuuust... 
 Help teach the class? 
 Absolutely! 
 Let's start with a simple back stretch. 
 Follow along! 
 [NECK CRUNCH] 
 [NECKS CRUNCH] 
 [DEEP BREATH] 
 [CREAK] 
 [SPINE CRACKS] 
 [BOING] 
 Now that we're warmed up, let me show you my favourite move: Go Go Gadget Prancing Porpoise! 
 [GROANS] 
 Looks like it's just me and you, Penny. 
 It's probably just as well. The Prancing Porpoise is pretty advanced! 
 Chief! 
 Gadget! 
 This is not the bathroom if that's what you were looking for. 
 No, I was looking for you. You have a new mission. 
 El Pecho, World Champion Wrestler, has a match tonight in Mexico. 
 We believe MAD may be after his championship belt. 
 Go undercover as a trainer and keep the belt safe. 
 This message will self-destruct. 
 You can count on me, Chief! 
 Inspector Gadget is always on duty. 
 Speaking of which, where is that bathroom?! 
 [BOOM!] 
 [GROANS] 
 This is it! 
 El Pecho is wrestling to keep his championship belt from the challenger, Gluteus Cheekster! 
 El Gecko looks tough but stiff. 
 Exactly the kind of person who'd benefit from some stretching! 
 Time to look for clues! 
 There's the Cheekster. 
 [CRIES] According to my Codex, Cheekster's a cheater, known for using every dirty trick in the book to win. 
 Where does one get this dirty book, and why wouldn't they clean it? 
 And that's El Pecho. 
 Wow, that belt is crazy shiny! 
 Yes, but not much good for holding up pants. 
 I wonder what it's made of? 
 In my expert opinion, definitely some kind of belt-like substance. 
 Well, I better keep myself limber by doing a little stretching. 
 That's working out the tension. 
 [CRIES] 
 Yup, I'm feeling it now. 
 Go Go Gadget Complex Yoga Move. 
 Whoa! 
 Brain, you stay with Uncle Gadget. 
 I'm going to see what I can find out about that belt. 
 Hmm. 
 The belt is made from Obscurium, the shiniest metal on Earth. 
 But what would MAD want with obscurium? 
 And why exactly do we want the obscurium? 
 I'll install it on my reflecting dish and use it to light up the moon. 
 It will be a full moon all the time! 
 Yeah, that's not ridiculous at all. 
 People will be sleep deprived and Chaos will reign! 
 The world will be mine to rule! 
 Plus Werewolves will never turn back! 
 Unless it's cloudy... or they have curtains... 
 WHAT WAS THAT?! 
 Nothing! 
 That belt is as good as yours! 
 The Cheekster will beat El Pecho without breaking a sweat. 
 OH YEAH! 
 Wow, you are very enthusiastic. 
 Well, just to make sure you win, I sent you a little something. Open that box. 
 Now the Cheekster has jewelry! OH YEAH! 
 And, come match time, all you have to do is tap the "wristbands" together and... [BOOM] .. it'll be LIGHTS OUT! 
 OH YEAH! 
 OH YEAH! 
 Yeah... that should work.... 
 Also, we should stop saying "Oh yeah." 
 Oh yeah! 
 Now where is El Borquo off to? 
 Go Go Gadget Roller Skates! 
 Whoa! 
 Good hit. 
 Obviously a wrestler. 
 You can pass. 
 You though, no way you're a wrestler. 
 [WHOOSH] 
 Nice tights. Love the stitching. 
 Still no. 
 [SMOOOCH] 
 Ugh! GET BACK HERE, YOU! 
 [STRETCHING] 
 Ah, Mr. El Gasso! 
 Just relax, and I'll have you loose in a jiffy. 
 Go Go Gadget Stretchers. 
 Aye! 
 That's it! Remember to breathe, El Campo! 
 It's El Pecho! 
 Excellent. 
 [GROANS IN PAIN] 
 Wowzers! More wrestlers warming up. 
 Well, you've come to the right place. 
 I'll help you with your stretches in just a minute. 
 [CRACKING] 
 Ugh! 
 [CROWD CHEERS] 
 The main event is starting soon... 
 MAD has got to be around here somewhere... 
 Great, it's Penny, and she's pretty close to our lair. 
 I guess I should head out and stop her, again. 
 Who's that? 
 What do you mean "Who's that"? That's Penny. 
 You know... Gadget's niece?... 
 Who? 
 I fight her all time... 
 You're talking gibberish. 
 Are you serious? PENNY! 
 The girl who's messed up our missions like a million times! 
 I don't know what this new obsession is with low value coins but you better make sure Cheekster is prepared for his match. 
 I want that championship belt! 
 Penny? Pfft. 
 Try to relax El Camino, you don't want to tense up again! 
 [BONK] 
 Now that's what I call relaxed! 
 So this is what MAD is up to! 
 If they use the metal from the belt, the reflection could keep the moon lit all the time, and no one would ever fall asleep again! 
 Unless it's cloudy... or they have curtains. 
 Talon : That's totally what I said! 
 Oh, and may I add: GOTCHA! 
 Well, I wouldn't really say "gotcha". 
 Okay... Now "gotcha" makes more sense. 
 Please, I have a match to prepare for! 
 All that's left to do is to is to show you my favourite move. 
 Go Go Gadget Prancing Porpoise! 
 Aye yi yi! 
 My back! I can't move! 
 Don't worry, that's totally normal. 
 [CROWD CHANTS] El Pecho! El Pecho! 
 Sounds like your match is about to start. 
 But I can't even stand! 
 How can I possibly wrestle? 
 No problem. 
 I'll go show everyone a few of my moves until you're ready. 
 But I'd better take this with me, to keep it safe. 
 You know El Puerco, this belt is very heavy. 
 That's VERY bad for your back! 
 [GROANS] 
 [GIRLISH SCREAM] 
 If you could stop bouncing around so much, this would be over in a jiffy. 
 Nope. And who says "jiffy"? 
 You're starting to sound like my uncle. 
 GO GO TALON GUM GUN! 
 OH, COME ON! 
 Whatever, I'll get you next time. 
 And now you're starting to sound like your uncle. 
 Wow, you have so crossed a line now. You're going down! 
 [CROWD CHEERS] 
 Calm down folks, it's okay, I've been training the champ. 
 [CROWD CHEERS] 
 He was surprisingly out of shape! 
 [CROWD GASPS] 
 He's been wearing this ridiculous heavy belt. 
 You should never wear a heavy belts like this! 
 THE CHEEKSTER WANTS THAT BELT! 
 OH YEAH! 
 My good man! You don't want this belt, believe me! 
 It will RUIN your back! 
 AHHH! 
 [FLOOR CREAKS] 
 Huh? Don't move! 
 You don't move! 
 [CRACK!] 
 Aaahhhhhh! 
 Let go of my feet! 
 Ugh! I'll let go when you wash your socks! 
 Which is clearly never! 
 I call this the elbow wiggle... 
 And the Cheekster calls this a body slam! 
 [SLAMS] 
 I'm not sure you're doing it right... 
 Oh yeah! 
 Get off of me! 
 What are you doing now?! 
 Watch and learn! 
 [SCREAM] 
 Oh yeah! 
 The Cheekster is knocked down! Oh no! 
 Looks like it's a tag-team! 
 Bring it! 
 Oh yeah! 
 Hold on, first I need to teach you my favourite move! 
 Go Go Gadget Prancing Porpoise! 
 [CRACK] 
 [CROWD GASPS] 
 [CRACK] 
 Cheekster is considering a career change. 
 Yeowch. 
 Ooh, that's just not right. 
 Just some subtle adjustments and you be good as new! 
 Go Go Gadget Stretchers! 
 Gotta run! 
 [CRACK] 
 My back. It's fixed! 
 Thank you amigo! 
 [GROANS] 
 [CHEERS] 
 I can't take it! I give up! MERCY! MERCY! 
 Is our demonstration over already? 
 [1... 2... 3!] 
 [BELL RINGS] 
 Thank you! Thank you! 
 I hope you all learned something! 
 Hasta luego, Penny. 
 Yeah, I hope your rocket boots burn your socks. 
 Thank you for defending my belt, my friend. 
 No problem, El Gespatcho. 
 Take it, but be careful! 
 It's torture on your back. 
 Congratulations, Gadget. 
 You've done it again. 
 Thanks, Chief. 
 You know, you're looking a bit tense. 
 I bet a little stretching will help you relax! 
 [CLAMPS & CRACKS] 
 [YELLS] 
 That is just not right. 
 NO! I'll get you next time, Gadget!
