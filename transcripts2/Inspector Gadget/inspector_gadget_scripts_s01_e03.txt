 Dr Claw : No! No! No! 
 Nooooo! I can't figure out how to launch my new, high-tech website! Here lemme do it. I was just about to do that. [CHUCKLES] Isn't it great! I designed it myself. I'm planning to use it to recruit a 'teen army' that will take over Metro City! No one is going to want to follow you on that! It's terrible! Oh, you think I should use the Tweep, or Twip or whatever it is? At least this took some old-fashioned evil work to design. Yeah. Anyhoo, what I wanted to tell you is that I've created this Mind Control Device that I plan on using tonight at the concert. I'm going to impersonate international popstar Nigel St De La Peppertone the III. Esquire the Fourth and then take over his entire audience of adoring fans! Then you'll have your "teen army." Huh? Fine. You can try your stupid plan and after it fails, then we can launch my website. I just need to use this MAD Disguise-O-Matic 6000 for the perfect Nigel lookalike disguise. Hmm... [SMACK!] Ow! No wonder we never use this. It kinda burns! [SNICKER] [WHISTLING POP TUNE] [GRUNT] [CHEERING] Gonna see Nigel in concert tonight! [WHISTLING SONG CONTINUES] [SIGH] What IS that? A band of attacking kettles? Uncle Gadget, it's Nigel! International pop star whistler. Ah, whistling, the finest of the bodily-made musical arts. [SNIFFS] The barbecue! Chief Quimby! What are you doing here? [BURPS] You've got a new mission Gadget. HQ has gotten word that MAD plans to kidnap international pop star Nigel St De La Peppertone IV. Esquire III. before tonight's concert. You are to make sure he arrives at the concert safely... this message will self-destruct. We'll get right to it, Chief. [BOOM!] [GROANS] Nigel St. De La Peppertone IV. Esquire III.! No way! [FANGIRL SCREAM] Greetings, Nelson Peppermint! Inspector Gadget reporting for security duty! Hi, I'm Penny. And I want you to know that I'm... Let me guess? You're a fan? Of course you are. There's been a complication. Gadget and Penny are here. And Penny's going ga-ga over Nigel St. De La Peppertone IV. Esquire III.! Gadget is there?!!! Yeah... and Penny! I mean, what does she even see in this guy? You must stop Gadget! He will ruin everything! [STRUGGLING] You know, Niles... It's Nigel, actually. Ah yes, sorry, Niger. As I was saying, I know a thing or two about music too. I was the front singer for a popular jazz/opera group in my younger days. [SINGING OPERA] # Go-go-go-go Gadget Gadget! # ♪ Go-go-go Gadget Gadget! Go! ♪ 
♪ Go-go-go-go Gadget-go Gadget-go! ♪ 
♪ Go-go-go-go Go-go-go go-go go! ♪ Sorry mate, I'm sure you think I think it was very interesting. But I don't. Shouldn't we be going? Right you are! To the Gadgetmobile! Not necessary. I brought my own ride... Wowsers, great idea. We should split up. That way MAD won't know what car you're really in. I'll follow to make sure the coast is clear. [BRAIN HOWLS] Oooh, this is nice. [SIGH] Yeah. So listen, I need some private time. You know how it is. Um... yeah... sure. So, Penny! Did you want another picture with me? Or maybe, you know... we could get together after the show? Really? That would be amazing! Wait a minute. What happened to your accent? Oh yeah. That. I just thought I'd try something different. Since you like Nigel... I mean, me... so much... why don't we go see a movie? Hey. I know that voice. You're Talon! Okay, you got me. But I had you there, didn't I? What are you up to, Talon? It's brilliant, actually. I'm gonna impersonate your favourite popstar, who you're all in love with, and mind control his audience to create a teen army for my Uncle Claw! But, seriously, if I wear the mask, would you wanna go out? That's your plan? Well, it doesn't have to be a movie. Oh! The mind control. Yeah. That's a terrible plan. Fine! I try and I try... [GRUMBLES] Huh? [ELECTRIC ZAP] A little quiet, please? Nigel! We've gotta get out of here. Engage autopilot! Ah! Here he comes now! Nando! Nice to see you again. It's Nigel, actually. I thought you'd ride with Penny. I thought I'd ride back here with you. Right you are, Norbert. There's no safer place than with Inspector Gadget. Let's go. And on the way, I can play you my demo album! Your what-now?!? ♪ Go, go, go, Gadget, go... ♪ # go, go go... # Please! [HOWLS] [BRAIN WHIMPERS] Brain! Talon has us trapped inside the limo. We need your help! [YAWNS] Is it three o'clock yet? Time for my Eurasian Mocha Soaka Mud Mask! You know we're trapped, right? Not to mention MAD is going to mind-control your entire audience, turning them into an army of evil! Ah! Here it is. The vinyl copy. This one's got gum all over it! [SCREAMS] It would be nice if I had my dragon skin socks. You know what would be very nice? If you got off your butt and helped! Do you know how much my butt is insured for? I thought you were this super awesome talent, but now I see you're just a pampered, selfish jerk! I'm so done being your fan! [GASP] You're right! I've been so busy getting exotic animal smoothies, that I forgot how to be a normal person. ♪ Go go go go go Gadget go ♪ 
♪ Go go go Gadget Gadget go, ♪ ♪ Go go go go Gadget ... ♪ [BLUBBERING] [GRUNTS] Hmmm. So, what exactly do you need me to do? [GASP] [WHISTLES] That's it. Whistling! Just... whistle. I'll do the rest. [WHISTLES] [LOUD SHRIEKING NOISE] We're too late! We're going off the end of the pier. [SCREAMS] [ARF?] Oh. [CHUCKLES] Nevermind. We make a pretty good team. Yeah! Time to get you to your concert and stop Talon. [YELP!] [SPLASH!] We made it just in time, Nestor! And if you need any backup out there, I've got this! Now go break a leg! [CROWD SHRIEKING] No big deal. Thousands staring. Right at me... Come on. You got this! No you don't! [STRUGGLE] This isn't Nigel! He's a fake! Here's the real Nigel! [CROWD ROARS] I don't need a mask to use this! You are all under my control! [ELECTRIC WARBLING] [LAUGHS] It works! I now have a teen army for Uncle Claw. And he didn't think it would work. Oh no! Nesbit is putting his entire audience to sleep. I'd better do something. Go Go Gadget Record Player! - Wowsers! Whoa! Oh no! [THUD] [GRUNTS] Huh? Wowsers! Uncle Gadget, you did it! You saved everyone! Of course. All in a day's work, Penny. 
 
 [CROWD CHEERS, MUSIC PLAYS] Great work, Gadget. Nigel is safe, and we've nabbed MAD's mind control device. I want to dedicate this next song, to a very special person... me... and I suppose... Penny! Aaaah! He's so awesome! [WHISTLING SONG] We were this close to having a teen army! I knew your plan wouldn't work. Luckily we still have my website. [BLIP] [8-BIT SOUNDS: BLIP, BLIP, BLIP.] Whoo-hoo! I have more followers! It's just MADcat... Nooooo...! [PARISIAN ACCORDIAN MUSIC] [TIRES SCREECH] Corsetta Camisole! What is the status of Professor Von Slickstein? He and his new invention are due in Paris shortly, Claw, darling. I will be there to intercept him... once I clear this infuriating traffic. [ROCKETS FIRE] [CRASH] [SCREAMS] Phew... [SCREAMS] [EXPLOSION, TIRES SCREECH] I have displeasing news however... Inspector Gadget is chaperoning the Professor. Gadgeeeet! I dislike him the most. [GROAN] I should have just sent my invention in the mail. Why did I have to come here to present it? Well I bet it'll be the best one at the convention! I couldn't agree more! Also, I don't remember what it is. That's because he hasn't told us yet! Sorry, Penny. You need Level 5 Clearance to get an early look and you're only at Level 4. Well, I'm at Level 13! Go Go Gadget neck! Ah! Ahh! Um... who's flying the car? Wowsers! Gadget : Ahh... perfect parking! The Gizmo-Garb Tech Show. The showcase for tech-related fashion. [GASPS] This is so amazing! ...and so very terrifying! There's no reason to be nervous. You are a tech fashion guru with an important invention to show. You're right. It's just the whole presenting thing makes me nervous! [SPRAYS INHALER] Because of the crowd? A crowd is nothing to fear, Professor. It's just tens of thousands of people watching your every move. [MUSIC] Wowsers! Chief Quimby is trapped in some kind of invisible force field! Go Go Gadget force field breaker! Oops, sorry Chief. That's all right, Gadget. Here's your mission. HQ has learned that MAD's fashion agent Corsetta Camisole is at the Tech Show. She's a master of disguise who will stop at nothing to get Von Slickstein's invention. Your mission is to protect the Professor and stop Corsetta. This message will self-destruct. We're on it, Chief! Oops, I believe this is yours. Phew. [BOOM!] [GROANS] Brain, you watch over Uncle Gadget. I'll stay with the Professor. Hmmm, Corsetta Camisole could be anywhere, wearing anything! With my keen eye and attention to detail, I better be on the lookout for anything even remotely strange. A-ha! An agent of MAD if I ever saw one! Your plastic coating doesn't fool me! Strike a pose, Inspector Gadget! A-ha! So, hiding in plain sight... ...Corsetta Camisole! [WHIMPERS] Go-go Gadget handcuffs! [WHIMPERS] Wowsers, you should really drink more milk! Oooh, this dressing room's nice. Let's order room service! Some food might make you feel better. [SIGHS] Why not? Anything to take my mind off this presentation. Professor Von Slickstein. Ten minutes to presentation. [GASPS] Well, at least there's no sighting of Corsetta Camisole yet... [CODEX RINGS] Brain! Who did this to you? [GROWLS, BARKS] Corsetta Camisole?! She's heading our way? My invention! She's coming to get it! Here! Protect it, Penny! It's too important to fall into MAD hands! But you have to present it. I can't present it if it's stolen! Fine, I'll protect it! [CHUCKLES] But I can only play keepaway until you're due on stage! Meet me there in ten minutes! Stop, you agent of MAD! [GASP] Say, aren't you Gadget's annoying niece? Outta my way, little girl! Hey! Aren't you one of Dr. Claw's thugs? Out of my way, old lady. [ZAP! ZAP!] She uses her purse as a weapon? Who does that?! Whoa! Sorry! Aah! Sorry! Where did she go? Professor Von Slickstein, six minutes to presentation. Would you stop saying that?! [BANGING and YELPING] Who is it? I should warn you, I have a shoe... with a heel! [DOOR KNOCKS] Wait... that's the secret HQ knock! [GRUNTS] Ah, the auto-floppy restraint hat, unbreakable poly-fibre ribbons, auto-camouflage unattractive spray. Oh, that Corsetta Camisole is good. Why thank you. Brain, have you seen the Professor? I think Corsetta is heading back to get him! You could say that. [LAUGHS] You fools actually believed that I came to steal one invention? If I kidnap the Professor, I get all the inventions! If you harm one hair on his head... Oh, he's fine. [MUFFLED] Help! Help! I have the Professor. Now all of his brilliant ideas will belong to MAD! I hope you folded him properly. I don't like my scientists wrinkled. Unless they're really old... actually even then it kinda creeps me out. You're a wily one, Corsetta Camisole. But nothing escapes the watchful eye of Inspector Gadget. [WHOMP!] [MUFFLED YELLING] Oh! Pardon me, m'am. Here, let me help you with your very noisy trunk. Oh... why thank you, sir. Whom I totally don't know at all! What? That MAD agent is stealing your very noisy trunk! Stand back ma'am, I'll stop her. Go Go Gadget grabbers! Whoa! Time to separate the baggage from the bag. You, little girl, are becoming a nuisance! You're the nuisance, Corsetta! And I'm not a little girl! [POP] Quick, Professor! Climb out! Yes! It belongs to a very irate woman who's trying to get it back! Whoaaa-aaaa-oaaaa... [CRASH] Behold: my very fetching handbag! Impressive. That attendee has my vote for best Gizmo-Garb! Professor! Under the runway! Look under the runway!! My Personal Armour Device! Just take it and run! No. I've done enough running... Oooh, so brave. Let me capture the moment! That's your invention? Underwear? Not just underwear, Armour-wear! [MECH SOUNDS] Ehhh... [CROWD CHEERS] [ZAP! ZAP-ZAP!] Way to go, Professor! People love your invention! [APPLAUSE] Oooof! But manage, that MAD agent is trying to kidnap the Professor! Go Go Gadget handcuffs! [GRUNT!] [POOF!] [CHEERING!] Just doing my job, folks! [LAUGHS] I did it, Penny! I presented my invention to a crowd! And it's all thanks to you! So, what do you think of my Personal Armour-wear now? [SEXY DANCE MUSIC] Good job, Professor! Not likely I'll ever wear it but.... Corsetta! Where is the professor? He foiled me with his terribly unfashionable underwear. I mean, who would even wear such a thing? Oh, and Gadget got away... What! Gadgeeeet!
