 [EXPLOSION] 
 Well, what do we have here? 
 Ah... 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 You've located the artifact. 
 Now for a full-scale activation! 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Of course, of course. 
 Uh, nothing's happening. 
 What's taking so long? 
 Regrettably the box did not come with an instruction manual. 
 The regret will be all yours if you don't figure it out. 
 Now put on your thinking cap! 
 The newest addition to the Gadget-mobile is my greatest masterpiece yet! 
 What have you got for us today, Professor? 
 A new gas gauge? 
 Air conditioner. 
 Ooh! A fancy horn that plays La Cucaracha! 
 ♪ La cucaracha, la cucaracha, la la la la la la la ♪ 
 I'm sure it's something much cooler than that, Uncle Gadget. 
 Prepare to have your socks knocked off! 
 But I just got these socks and I really like them! 
 I have created the most advanced piece of artificial intelligence ever! 
 Ah, great. 
 [ZZZAP] 
 Whoops. 
 Oh dear, so sorry, it's this one! 
 [BONK] 
 No, not that one either. 
 [GIGGLES] 
 [POP] 
 Uh, this one? 
 Aha! It's this one! 
 Yes! You guys are gonna love this! 
 There may still be some kinks to work out. 
 Oh, hello Chief. 
 We have a new mission, Gadget. 
 HQ has reason to believe that MAD has acquired an ancient artifact originating from the remote Easter Island. 
 We don't know exactly what it is, but whatever Dr. Claw is up to... it's not good. 
 This message will self-destruct. 
 [BEEPING] 
 Don't you worry, Chief. 
 Penny and I will visit the Easter Bunny on his island. 
 Perhaps he's hiding more than chocolate eggs. 
 No! Uncle Gadget! 
 [EXPLODES] 
 [GROANS] 
 Looks like I'll be needing a new Gadget-mobile. 
 And don't forget to install the horn, Professor! 
 ♪ La cucaracha, la cucaracha, la la la la la la la ♪ 
 No. Too flashy. 
 Won't match my claw. 
 Oooh, Evil overlord thrones for only 100 million dollars at Wacky Carl's Evil Furnishings Warehouse? 
 For that price I can't afford NOT to buy one! 
 Another hairball?! 
 What are you feeding this cat... 
 Hair? 
 She's tracked kitty litter all over the lair and I don't care if it's evil-scented. 
 I'm not picking any of it up. 
 YES YOU ARE! And do you mind?! 
 I'm online shopping! 
 Forget those Easter Island statues. 
 You should get that one. 
 It's sick. Like totally depraved. 
 I don't care how "depraved" it is. 
 It's not right for my Zen rock garden. 
 [PEACEFUL MUSIC] 
 Y'know what's not right? 
 Making a Zen rock garden. 
 [PEACEFUL MUSIC] 
 They're all the rage for channeling inner rage. 
 And those statues aren't just decoration, they're part of my plan to DESTROY Metro City and make my Zen Garden out of its decaying ruins! 
 [EVIL LAUGH] 
 How?! Statues just stand around doing nothing. 
 Much like you! 
 And you wonder why MADtana Dan doesn't want to work with you. 
 [RINGS] 
 Speak of the devil. 
 [chuckles] 
 Not quite the devil, but I do have my moments! 
 Dr. Claw, I'm still working to activate the artifact. 
 Well, hurry up! 
 The sooner I obliterate Metro City the sooner I can unwind in my Zen garden... 
 Of destruction. 
 My Zen garden of destruction. 
 [SOMEONE SCREAMS] 
 I like that. Now, make it happen! 
 Um, MADtana Dan, let me know if you need any help, okay? 
 Anything for you. 
 Oh, gotta go! 
 Wowsers, Penny, if this is Easter Egg Land, where are all the eggs? 
 [SCREAMING] 
 This is a tourist attraction. 
 You'd think they'd leave a little more room for parking. 
 These Moai statues are incredible! 
 They look so calm, and peaceful. 
 But where are their bodies... 
 And their hats?! 
 Uh well actually... 
 Don't answer that, Penny. 
 I know where they are. MAD has stolen them! 
 Claw has gone too far. 
 You make sure those statues stay put. 
 I'll go look for their hats. 
 And chocolate eggs... And that Easter Bunny. 
 Now, repeat after me... I am an evil genius. 
 I am an evil genius. 
 I trust my inner rage to guide me. 
 I trust my inner rage to... 
 What are you doing, Uncle Oddball? 
 What does it look like? 
 It's evil meditation 101! 
 I'm using it to help keep my mind off this! 
 Gadget is interfering with my nefarious plans! 
 I am a ruthless villain who will achieve global domination. 
 And I will get Gadget. 
 And I WILL GET GADGET!! 
 And maybe you, if you don't get out of here! 
 Leaving... 
 Maybe he could use a chill garden. 
 Hmm... 
 Aha! A hat stand! 
 This must be where MAD kept all the stolen hats! 
 I'd better look for clues. 
 Go Go Gadget Magnifying Glass! 
 [ZZAP!] 
 [ZAP-ZAP] 
 Ah!! 
 [chuckles] 
 Whatever MAD is looking for has got to be down there! 
 [RUMBLING] 
 What was that? 
 [GASP] 
 We'd better go find Uncle Gadget! 
 [EVIL LAUGH] 
 [GASP] 
 MADtana Dan! 
 You may want to step on it, Penny. Before they step on you. 
 [EVIL LAUGH] 
 I couldn't figure out how to activate the statues, but your Uncle Gadget kindly took care of that for us. 
 Seems you're stuck between a rock and... another rock, Penny! 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Now, it's Gadget's turn to get rocked! 
 Those automatons will level Metro City and my zen rock garden will rise from the rubble! 
 Ooh, all the other evil overlords will be so jealous. 
 Oh gosh, you really think so? 
 Now all I need is a couple of bombsai trees and maybe a liquid nitrogen fountain! 
 There's one of the hats! 
 A clever decoy, MAD. 
 Though somewhat impractical. 
 Ow! Wowsers! 
 A nice Sunday stroll of destruction. 
 Try using your feet, Brain! 
 Come on Brain, we have to go help Uncle Gadget! 
 Unhand me you crusty goon! 
 Your snapping behaviour is highly suspicious. 
 Ack, let go! 
 You are now officially a suspected MAD agent. 
 You're coming with me. Go Go Gadget-mobile. 
 Ah, this must be the new horn I asked for. 
 I must let Penny know where I am... 
 Wowsers! 
 [CLANK] 
 [GRIND] 
 Cool! 
 Uncle Gadget! 
 Ah, more tourists for the Easter Egg hunt. 
 [SMASH!] 
 Oh no! 
 Wowsers, whoa. 
 Uncle Gadget, are you okay? 
 I'm... fine Penny. 
 I sure hope HQ has insurance! 
 You're not going anywhere! 
 That man has one of the hats! 
 Excuse me, sir, but I think you mistakenly picked up a hat that doesn't belong to you. 
 Why don't you come and take it from me? 
 Uncle Gadget, look out... 
 [SMASH] 
 Wowsers! Whoa, whoa whoa. 
 That helmet must be emitting some sort of frequency. 
 Maybe I can jam it! Or better yet, use it! 
 ARGH. ENOUGH! 
 I don't need to be bothered with this, when there's a city to destroy! 
 To Metro City! 
 Not so fast, MADtana Dan! 
 How dare you, you annoying little girl. 
 Wowsers, is it night already! Huh! 
 Island time really does fly by. 
 You're not getting away with... 
 Gaaadget! 
 Uncle Gadget, you've gotta take off the helmet! 
 I can't, there's a rock on my head. 
 Go Go Gadget Crowbar. 
 Uncle Gadget! 
 Come back! 
 Which way is back? 
 I can barely keep my head up. 
 Uncle Gadget, you did it! 
 Congratulations, Gadget! 
 You've done it once again. 
 Thank you, Chief! 
 Well Penny, we still need to find the Easter Bunny. 
 And those chocolate eggs! 
 Go Go Gadget-mobile. 
 [SPARKS] 
 
 
 
 Uh, Uncle Gadget? Don't you remember? 
 Oh yes. 
 I hope the Professor didn't spend too much time on that horn Perhaps now he could alter the Gadget-mobile so it transforms into a robot. 
 That would be cool. 
 Or a tiger. Nope, a robot. 
 [LAUGH] 
 When one's nefarious plan fails, one must seek revenge. 
 Revenge? I'm going on vacation! 
 How hard could it be to destroy Fiji? 
 [ALARMS] 
 What a humiliation! 
 Your face has been captured on security cam... for all to see! 
 It seems every heist we've pulled lately has been caught on camera! 
 I know! There's cameras everywhere. You can't escape them. 
 Since we can't escape them, we'll just have to ruin them! 
 The prestigious Le Zoom car race awards a trophy... made from a giant, ultra-magnetic rock! 
 If I won that trophy, I could use its magnetism to ERASE all the security drives in the city! 
 Yeah... That's a great idea! 
 Why are you so excited about this? 
 No reason... 
 I mean, it's just a good idea... 
 Heyyyy... is that the claw-sharpening truck I hear pulling up outside? 
 Finally! I really need a buffing! 
 Talon, clean the shark tank. 
 Talon, steal the world's largest shovel. 
 Next time, Gadget, NEXT TIME! 
 That trophy'll be perfect to get rid of this footage... 
 I just gotta make sure I get the trophy first and... 
 Na na na na na! 
 Ugh... what's this gonna cost me? 
 [MADCAT SNICKERS] 
 Professor! 
 Ah! 
 The new scooter works awesome! 
 Attention! This lab has been rezoned... for serious scootin'! 
 Okay. Safety message over. 
 Not quite, Penny. 
 I have another safety message for you! 
 This is "Volatilium!" 
 It's highly volatile! 
 And very explosive. 
 I beg you to be careful around it. 
 Will do, Professor Von Slick! 
 Wahh! 
 Penny! 
 This experimental scooter, complete with turbo boost, vertical grips, and invisibility cloak, was built for chasing down MAD agents, not for ruining my lab! 
 I know, but I need the practice! 
 Where do you get these ideas from?! 
 Wowsers! Out of the way, Professor! 
 Maybe you two should practice scooting... in a holo-room? 
 I would... but there seems to be a malfunction in three of them! 
 [EXPLOSION] 
 Make that four. 
 [SIRENS WAILING] 
 I don't condone reckless driving... but do I have a mission for you! 
 MAD has infiltrated the Le Zoom car race in Montreal! 
 We believe that MAD Agent Jacques Crankcase is planning to sabotage the race. 
 The flag drops in an hour. 
 Your mission is to stop MAD from winning that race! 
 This message will NOT self-destruct. 
 Phew, that's a relief... 
 You got it, Chief! 
 Let's go, Penny! 
 We've got a race to win! 
 [BOOM!] 
 [GROANS] 
 Go Go Gadget Race Car. 
 I am so psyched! 
 All MAD is gonna see of me is my tire tracks! 
 Not so fast. 
 It's one thing to scoot around HQ, Penny... but you don't have your driver's licence yet! 
 You stick to navigating... I'll take care of the driving. 
 Trust me Penny, there's more to driving than just driving. 
 Go Go Gadget Race Helmet. 
 Wowsers! Whoa! Oof! 
 [TIRES BOUNCE] 
 [SCREEEEE-CRASH!] 
 They should really keep the course clear of debris... 
 It's just not safe! 
 I wonder who that mystery driver is... 
 There's something familiar about him... 
 The Number 13 car! That's Jacques Crankcase! 
 We've got to keep an eye on him, Brain! 
 Jacques Crankcase! 
 The world's most cheatingest racer! 
 Monsier Docteur Claw. 
 What to do about the Gadget Inspectaire? 
 Well, you know how these races go, Jacques... accidents do happen. 
 [LONG EVIL LAUGH] 
 Enough! 
 Now, get rid of Gadget and the others so I can claim the Le Zoom Cup as mine! 
 When driving, you must always be aware of your surroundings. 
 [BEEP-BEEP... BEEEP!] 
 [TIRES SCREECH] 
 You must observe everything! 
 Um... yes. For sure... 
 Maybe though, we should get going? 
 Slow down! 
 How do you expect to win the race with all this speeding?! 
 Uh, could we go just a bit faster? 
 Now now, Penny! Safety first! 
 That's the first rule of driving. 
 [EVIL CHUCKLE] 
 Always keep an eye out for danger! 
 That's the second rule of driving! 
 [GIGGLES] 
 [SKID] 
 [THEY SCREAM] 
 [CRASH!] 
 Not bad, Crankcase... but I need that trophy. 
 It's my butt in Uncle C's chair! 
 This is where unsafe driving gets you! 
 Go Go Gadget Accident Gear! 
 [POLICE SIREN] 
 Now I can show you how being a driver isn't only about driving! 
 [POLICE SIREN] 
 Okay, move it along! Nothing to see here! 
 Hmm... 
 No left turns! 
 Crankcase and that mystery scooter are still in the race. 
 His EMP blast, rendered all these other cars useless! 
 Good thing I'm not driving a car. 
 Brain, keep an eye on Uncle Gadget. 
 The victory, she is only made sweeter, by the cheating! 
 Well done, Jacques! 
 You've cleared the field for my victory lap! 
 Jacques Crankcase, he promises you ze cup. 
 But aftair the victory! 
 That's not how MAD works. 
 You do the dirty stuff, I do the winning. 
 [TIRES SCREECH] 
 [CRASH!] 
 [SPLAT-SPLAT!] 
 Not so fast Uncle C. 
 For reasons I don't wanna get into, I gotta win this... 
 Before you do! 
 I never should have stolen that scooter for him. 
 This'll be easier than I thought! 
 [SCREECHES] 
 [POLICE SIREN] 
 Ahh, safety. What a thrill! 
 Jaywalking?! Oh no you did not! 
 [CRASH!] 
 There you go! Safe-and-sound! 
 So! You forgot about ze numbair 13, eh? 
 Oh, Too bad for you. 
 [ROCKETS FIRE] 
 Woo! Hoo-hoo! 
 Missed m-eee! 
 I'll let you off with a warning if you promise to be more attentive! 
 What? Is there something in my nose? 
 Go Go Gadget Hankie! 
 [WHOOSH!] 
 [WHOOSH-WHOOSH!] 
 Wowsers! 
 I don't know who you are, but this vehicle is not street legal! 
 Go Go Gadget Safety Belts! 
 [BRAIN HOWLS] 
 Talon, we need to work together to win this race! 
 Yeah... that could work. 
 [ZZZAP!] 
 Oops. Sorry Uncle C. I was kinda in the zone. 
 Well this should knock you out of "the zone". 
 [BOOM] 
 Time to test out the Professor's cloaking device. 
 [SNIFFS!] 
 I pick up the hint of... scooter-grade gasoline? 
 [PAINT SPLATS] 
 [EUGH!] 
 Why the cheating has such a bad reputation, I weel nevair know. 
 Nothing, she can beat me now! 
 Sorry! Forgot to signal! 
 You see Penny, safe driving always wins! 
 Good work... uh... team. 
 You saved the Le Zoom car race. 
 But I wonder why MAD wanted that trophy in the first place? 
 You can't come back in until you fix my car. 
 I just had it painted! 
 At least this day can't get worse. 
 [SNICKERS] 
 Next time Gadget, next time! 
 I'll get you Talon!
