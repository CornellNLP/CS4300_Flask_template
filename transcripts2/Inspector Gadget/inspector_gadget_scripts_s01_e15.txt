 Are you ready to play for a new washer dryer? 
 Dr Claw  Ooh, goody goody goody goody, I will destroy this trivia question. 
 Hey, Uncle C. 
 Quiet, Talon. 
 It would be waaay easier to get in the lair without the traps. 
 Stop whining! 
 The correct answer is potato! 
 Argh! I missed the question! 
 Don't hurt me. 
 I have a job for you. 
 A video has turned up showing the lost Yogic Helmet of Thought! 
 In the monastery of MOUNT KIKYAFAYSIN in Tibet. 
 Why do you need it? 
 You know you don't look good in hats. 
 The Helmet of Thought will increase my already enormous mental powers. 
 I will be able to craft the finest doomsday devices, crush all of my enemies, and have all of the answers for my favourite game show "Questionators!" 
 I WILL WIN A WASHER/DRYER! 
 A documentary on checkers? 
 Cartoons? 
 "The Questionators" game show? 
 Are you ready... 
 [GROWLS] 
 I know. I know. 
 There are just too many decisions to make! 
 What if I make the wrong one at the wrong time? 
 Or the right one at the wrong time? 
 Or the wrong one at the right time? 
 I can't even make good clothing choices. 
 Oh, Penny, whenever I make a wrong decision, which is never, I like to just move on. 
 You know the old saying: get right back on the horse and punch a bird in a bush. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Wowzers. Chief Quimby's on TV! 
 It's so lifelike. You could almost reach out and... 
 [HORN] 
 OW! It's really me, Gadget! 
 You're are a strange and lovely man, Chief. 
 This is for you Gadget. 
 We believe the mythical "Helmet of Thought" has been located at a monastery in the Himalayas. 
 Your mission is to get it before MAD does. 
 It's a race against time... this message will self destruct. 
 Race against time! 
 My favourite kind of race! 
 [BOOM] 
 Your guide, Tenspring, will meet you at the foot of the mountain. 
 Go Go Gadget mobile Snowmobile Mode. 
 [BRAIN YELPS / PENNY SCREAMS] 
 Oh, Chief Quimby told us we'd have a guide. 
 Hello! 
 Are you Tenspring? 
 Most definitely. 
 I'm your guide and all around enjoyable fellow. 
 [SNIFFS] 
 Well hello there, you exotic man of mountains. 
 [BARKS] 
 Nice, doggie. I like ugly doggie. 
 [GROWLS] 
 Ummm shall we be going? 
 Lead on, Tenthings, my good man! 
 Are you sure this is the fastest route? 
 Absolutely, my lady. Super fast. 
 Uhmm can I have my hand back? 
 Oh. Yes. Sorry... 
 Umm... Sherpa Cramp! 
 Aha! Who's this suspicious character? 
 According to my extensive knowledge of mountaineering, Yaks are known for their ability to find the best mountain paths. 
 Go Go Gadget Friendly Petter! 
 Whoaaa! 
 [YAK SNORTS] 
 Lead the way! 
 We'll be at the top in no time! 
 Uncle Gadget? 
 Brain, follow Uncle Gadget and make sure he doesn't get into trouble. 
 [BRAIN GROANS] 
 [QUIET SNICKER] 
 Yes yes, go and leave us be, ugly doggy. 
 Now stop, you hairy beast! 
 Who turned out the lights? 
 Go Go Gadget Flashlight. 
 [YAK ROARS] 
 Come back here! 
 Wowsers! 
 [MUTTERS] 
 Which path should I go on? 
 I don't know. 
 I just can't make up my mind. 
 Don't worry, you'll have a lot of time to think about it! 
 Talon! I should have known. 
 An actual Sherpa wouldn't insist on holding my hand so much. 
 What? I was... just... keeping... you warm! 
 Common courtesy! 
 Now I'm off to get the Helmet of Thought... 
 Or am I? 
 Yes, I am. 
 See, that's how to make a choice. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Oh yeah, well, have fun climbing the mountain on... 
 AH I CAN'T EVEN CHOOSE A GOOD COMEBACK! 
 Wowsers! 
 This little guy sure is in a hurry to get up to the monastery. 
 Goodbye, Gadget! 
 [RUMBLING SOUND] 
 I can hear the Monks chanting already! 
 Pretty loud guys. 
 You might start an avalanche like that! 
 Wait for me! Go Go Gadget Copter! 
 Whoaa! 
 [BRAIN YELPS] 
 [LICKING] 
 [YAK GROWLS] 
 Seriously? 
 Again. Seriously? 
 I knew I was right to trust that Yak! 
 Now to get the Helmet! 
 [GIYA!] 
 A traditional Himalayan Dance of Welcome! 
 Well, right back at ya! 
 Go Go Gadget Friendly Dance. 
 [TRADITIONAL IRISH MUSIC] 
 Whoa! 
 Ha! Well, that worked out. 
 Now to get the helmet for myself! 
 Or not. 
 Oh great... you. 
 How did you..? 
 The Nunks found me, too. 
 No thanks to you. 
 I thought you'd like a little time to yourself on an icy cliff. 
 I could have done worse, you know? 
 Oh yeah! Huh. So why didn't you? 
 SILENCE! 
 We know ye seek the Helmet of Thought. 
 It holds much power but it must not fall into the wrong hands. 
 Out of the way, granny. That helmet is mine! 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Okay... Okay... You... Win. 
 We aren't holding you captive, we were just leading you to the Helmet test! 
 Sorry, I'm used to having to work to get into places. 
 Now please let me go. 
 Wooh. I can feel my body again. 
 Before either may claim it, you must prove yourself worthy. 
 Them's a lot a hats! 
 Where's the Helmet of Thought? 
 That is the Helmet Test. 
 You must choose. 
 Choosing? Really? No! 
 WHY this? 
 Life is about choices. 
 Stand aside, Miss Can't Decide! 
 Watch me ace this "Helmet Test". 
 That one. Duh! That was easy. 
 There. Pow! 
 I can even feel myself getting smarter... 
 You chose wrong! 
 [SCREAMS] 
 [MONK SNICKERS] 
 Miss Penny. Choose. 
 Where's Uncle Gadget when you need him? 
 [LICKING] 
 Wowsers, a yeti! 
 He must be working for MAD! 
 Go Go Gadget Yeti Catcher! 
 [ROAR!] 
 Whoa! 
 That one is shiny. 
 But, that one's so tall... 
 And that one looks ancient. 
 How can I decide? 
 I know! 
 What's up with your wifi? 
 What do you want? 
 Wireless is choppy up here... 
 You must trust yourself to choose. 
 But what if I'm wrong? 
 You choose wrong, we keep helmet. 
 No big whoop. 
 But I'll get fired out the ceiling. 
 Good point. 
 Still, The mind's eye has the clearest sight! 
 What about the heart's eye? 
 Mind, heart, two sides of the same coin. 
 Ummmm no they're not. 
 They are often in conflict. 
 Which leads to indecision. 
 Would you just get on with it?! 
 Just choose ONE HELMET. 
 Ok Ok. Ummm... 
 This one. 
 [SNICKERS LIKE A WITCH] 
 That..... is correct. Wise choice. 
 I knew it!... Sort of! 
 Thank you! 
 Hey! Give that back, Talon. 
 Wow. I can feel my mind expanding. 
 Woh ho ow! 
 Oh no! 
 Eee, oowww, oooo, wowsers. 
 It's all so clear. 
 An ocean of numbers, stretching across time. 
 The pyramids... the stars... all connected. Which means, the meaning of life is... 
 Whoa whoa whoa, wow! 
 [SMASH!] 
 That's it. I'm switching careers. 
 Teen boy has disrupted our dojo and made us miss pilates. 
 After him! 
 [SCREAMS IN TERROR] 
 So much for the Helmet of Thought. 
 
 
 
 Penny, you should have been there! 
 I was hot on the trail of the helmet, when a MAD Yeti operative forcefully threw me down a crevasse to keep me off the track! 
 Great work, team! 
 You've foiled MAD's attempt at getting the Helmet of Thought and kept it safe! 
 Now that's a hat! Am I right?... 
 [SCREAMS] 
 I guess the Chief was in a hurry. 
 We'd better get going if we're going to catch up to him! 
 Abraham Lincoln! 
 The correct answer is Potato. 
 GAH! Always Potato! 
 Hurry up! 
 I think I'm missing pieces. 
 Oh. You certainly are. 
 I'll get you Gadget! NEXT TIME! 
 No MADcat, don't touch Daddy's toys! 
 MADcat! This is Daddy's hobby! 
 [MADCAT GRUMBLES] 
 What's the big deal? Toys are made to be broken. 
 You break stuff all the time. 
 These aren't toys, they're precious antiques! 
 [CRASH!] 
 What?! 
 [TRAIN WHISTLE DIES] 
 Bad kitty! Ugghh... 
 I need a new choo choo. 
 And I've got just the one in mind. 
 Bring me The Hover Express. 
 And take MADcat with you! 
 [GADGET] Stop that train! 
 [ZAP!] 
 A fireworks and laser show? 
 They're really rolling out the red carpet! 
 I've got an opening, Uncle Gadget! 
 Great, let's go there! 
 Right after we watch this last firework go off. 
 [BOOM!] 
 [CLANG CLANG CRASH] 
 Whoa! 
 Well, as I always say, any crash landing you impossibly walk away from is a good... 
 Wowzers! 
 [TRAIN HONK!] 
 Professor Von Slickstein, Sir Owen Barnstormer... 
 You forgot your lunch! 
 Sorry to show up unannounced. 
 We reeeeeally shoulda called ahead. 
 Not at all, Penny. 
 You've shown me The Hover Express is everything I built it to be. 
 Isn't it amazing? 
 A modern master piece by Mr. Barnstormer! 
 My friends call me Sir Owen. 
 We're friends now! 
 Hey, lunch is on the Chief! 
 No time for food, agents. 
 We have to move fast! 
 MAD plans to hijack The Hover Express. 
 Your mission is to move it to HQ where it will be secure. 
 This message will self destruct. 
 Well, what are we waiting for? We've gotta roll! 
 Or hover... or whatever this train does. 
 [BRAIN WHIMPERS] 
 You're right, Brain. 
 Let's get the Gadget mobile back to HQ for repairs. 
 Go Go Gadget G Portal! 
 [WHOOOSH] 
 Well, that was easier than usual. 
 [CRASH!] 
 I stand corrected... 
 [SCREAM] 
 [BOOM!] 
 [SIGHS] 
 I could get used to this. 
 Gadget : There's no time to read superhero biographies! 
 The Chief's orders were very clear, we have to protect this train! 
 Would you be terribly put out if we tested the secondary engine car at the back of the train? 
 Sorry, my good men. 
 We can't possibly put out the secondary train at the back of the test engine! 
 Um yeah... 
 We need to get the Hover Express to HQ! We can't stop for anything. 
 [CODEX RINGS] 
 Except to see what's blocking our way... 
 Hit the brakes! 
 [BRAKES SQUEAL] 
 An injured baby coyote? 
 [WHIMPER] 
 Aw, don't worry little one, I've got you! 
 [SNEEZE!] 
 Time to add coyotes to the allergy list, along with cats and annoying evil overlord's nephews. 
 [MADCAT SNICKERS] 
 [BRAIN GROWLS] 
 Is there anything you can do for it? 
 Of course! 
 Go Go Gadget First Aid Kit! 
 [SHRIEKING] 
 [BRAIN GROWLS] 
 Brain! Shouldn't you be out chasing cats? 
 Bad dog. 
 [MADCAT SNICKERS] 
 Okay, let's add this little guy to the list of passengers on the train. 
 That's weird... 
 I'm reading an extra life sign in the engine room... 
 So I look him dead in the eye and say, 
 "That's not a hydrothermic" quantum recoupler, this is a hydrothermic quantum "recoupler!" 
 [LAUGHS] 
 I wish I could have seen the look on his face! 
 I know, it probably looked just like yours when you realized I'm not supposed to be here! 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Intruder!  
 AAAAAGH! 
 [SPLAT! SPLAT!] 
 Stay there! This is the moment I've been train ing for. 
 Get it? 
 [GROAN] 
 Is it time for the in transit movie? 
 Yeah, starring Talon! 
 I think it's called "Snakes on a Train!" 
 Welcome to MAD Track! 
 I'm your new and incredibly handsome conductor. 
 Well hello, new and incredibly handsome conductor. 
 We'll be arriving at MAD Central Station in a few minutes so I suggest you sit back, and enjoy your last moments on Earth. 
 As if! When I'm done with you, I'm gonna feed you to our new coyote! 
 By "coyote" do you mean MADcat and her "acting skills"? 
 [FRANTIC WHIMPER] 
 [GROWLS] 
 Get back here baby coyote! 
 Go Go Gadget Pet Catcher! 
 WOWZERS! A real life superhero? 
 And he's trying to help that poor coyote! 
 I'm right behind you, Caped Canine! 
 Sorry, blondie. This engine room is "authorized personnel" only. 
 Aw man, there's nothing I can do... is what I'd say if there wasn't a whole other engine car on the other side of the train! 
 BOO YEAH! 
 Oh no, you've outsmarted me... is what I'd say if I didn't control everything here. 
 [WHOOSH!] 
 Tuck and roll, Pen! 
 Tuck and roll. 
 This'll either end really really badly or... 
 Yeah, probably just badly. 
 Please tell me the worst is over. 
 [VRRRT!] 
 Did you find the coyote? 
 Great posing, by the way, very heroic! 
 The Hover Express is going to arrive on time. 
 Feel free to shower me with praise. 
 Not until it arrives undamaged. I like my collectables mint! 
 [BOOM!] 
 What is going on up there? 
 Girl's got game. 
 Oooooooohhh! He liiiiikes her! 
 Time to get this train back on track! 
 Where'd she go? 
 Buckle up. 
 You're on an express train to Prison town, population: you. 
 Oooooohhhh! SASSY! 
 This trip's not over yet. 
 Computer Voice : Security system: deactivated. 
 I'm here to help, Caped Canine! 
 [CAT & DOG SQUEALING] 
 Hang on Caped Canine! I'll help you! 
 Go Go Gadget Butterfly Net! 
 You didn't think I'd let you drive this train alone, did you? 
 Penny : I was counting on it. 
 Navigation, locked. 
 Car coupler, unlocked! 
 [GRUNTS] 
 Hah. 
 Not that I'm keeping score, but Penny: one... Talon.... [SHOOM!] also one. Ugh, I always forget the footwear! 
 There. Everything's back on track. 
 Pemmy neebs our helb! 
 Wab shoob we do? 
 Deactababe da securiddy sistums! 
 [SPLAT! SPLAT!] 
 [TALON CHUCKLES] 
 [LASERS FIRE] 
 Easy on the paint job! I gotta get this back to Claw in one piece! 
 [SCREECHES] 
 Is your dog wearing a cape? 
 Maybe. 
 [LASERS & FIGHTING] 
 [GASP] 
 Huh? 
 We deactababed da securiddy sistums! 
 Thanks guys! 
 Don't worry, injured coyote. Inspector Gadget's got you. 
 Go Go Gadget Handcuffs! 
 Woahhh! 
 [MADCAT SCREECH] 
 OH, COME ON!! 
 I guess that makes it Penny: two... Talon: one. 
 Not that I'm counting, which I am. 
 Huh? 
 The MAD Base! 
 Uncle Gadget, The Caped Canine wants to see your G Portal! 
 You think? 
 Well, who am I to refuse a superhero. 
 Go Go Gadget G Portal. 
 [ZZZAP ZZZAP] 
 [WHOOOSH] 
 [SHAZAP!] 
 [SCREEEECH CRUNCH] 
 Phew! 
 Hello, Gadget. 
 I guess there's no way MAD will be getting their claws on this train now... 
 The credit goes to my super heroic friend, the Caped Canine! 
 Huh, guess he didn't wanna stick around for the credit. 
 What a hero! 
 Can we talk about this, Uncle Claw!? 
 You better hurry, Talon! Here comes the choo choo train! 
 A little help here please!
