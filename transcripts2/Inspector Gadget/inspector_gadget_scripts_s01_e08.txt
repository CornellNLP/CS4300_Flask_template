 [ZAP!] 
 They found us! [GASPS] [LASER BLASTS] Man, I really hate mazes... Uh, which way do we go? [BRAIN BARKS] [LASER BLASTS] Okay, kinda hard to scan for an exit route and run at the same time. Ooh, got it! [ROBOT NOISES] Oh no, this way Brain! The exit's this way! [EXPLOSIONS] Uncle Gadget, did you see that? I totally nailed the hedge test. I did, Penny! Well done! But someone has let this hedge grow way out of control! Go Go Gadget hedge trimmer! [CHAINSAW GROWLS] Whoa! Chief Quimby! Chief : I have a mission for you. MAD has discovered the location of the Lost City of Diamonds. Claw wants those diamonds for his laser so he can carve his name into the Moon, causing global weather disasters. Your mission is to find that Lost City before MAD does. This message will self-destruct. [BEEPING] Wow, how can Claw's plan be so dangerous and so lame at the same time? He is a criminal mastermind! There's no time to lose! Whoa! [BOOM!] [GROANS] [SCREECH] [HISSES] Hey, you think I want to clip your nails? [SCREECH] But MADcat, your claws scratched my claw. No one claws my claw. Dr. Claw, I've started decrypting the obelisk. You will have your diamonds. So says MADtana Dan. MADtana Dan! I can't believe I'm talking to the world's most amazing evil spy! Hey, maybe we could hang out some time? - Never. Please? Nope. Aw, come on! I'd rather be eaten by crocodiles. Please? Please? Please? Stop talking to me you weirdo. Fine! Soon I will use the world's biggest diamond to laser my name onto the Moon for everyone to see. [EVIL LAUGH] [LAUGHS] [TALON LAUGHS] [THEY STOP LAUGHING] ...right. [AHEM] MADtana Dan, out! Can you even imagine being him? He's so cool. Did I say stop grooming MADcat? Did I? [MEOW] Uncle Gadget, be careful. Don't worry, Penny! I'm as good a pilot as I am an inspector! Woaaah!! Whoa nelly! Well well well, who do we have here? And this, Penny, is what's known as the "Tall Skinny Pyramid". [OSTRICH GOBBLES] Uncle Gadget, I think we've got company. Inspector Gadget! Why yes, that is me. I am Dr. MADtana Dan, a simple archeologist. And who doesn't know the name of the world's greatest agent, Inspector Gadget? Oh. You're too kind, and also correct! Um, it looks like we are both here to find the Lost City of Diamonds. I MADtana Dan have found many, many lost cities of diamonds. Let's keep our eyes on the good doctor, Brain. I assure you, we will find this one together, okay? It'll be a pleasure to travel with a fellow scientist! Hm. So, these symbols are some kind of map showing us  the location of the Lost City of Diamonds. To start, the eye next to the owl and lion clearly means we need to keep an eye out for owl-riding lions. Which sound very ferocious, and wise. Now, let's see... snakes playing banjos are normally found in the South. Which must mean we head South to find the Lost City! That actually seems right. Let's go! There's no telling how close MAD is to the city already. [PHONE RINGS] Oh-oh. Sorry, but I have to take this. MADtana Dan. MADtana Dan! Oh, it's you. Has my mission changed?... You know, we should go for coffee, trade spy stories... maybe bond a little. Uh, yeah yeah, sure, sure. That sounds perfect. Okay! [GASPS!] I just need to get this seat back... a little more room, please. [FART SOUND] [PENNY SNIFFS] Uh, it wasn't me. I assure you. South it is to the soon to be "Un-lost Diamond City!" Guys, I think this hole is the same size as the one on the map. So that must mean that the Lost City is down there! Wait a minute, Penny. I think this hole is the same size as the one on the map, so that must mean the Lost City... is down there! [GRUMBLES] [CLAW SNORING] [ZZZZZT!] What is it?! I'm very busy! Oh... it's you. Report! I, MADtana Dan, will be at the Lost City soon. Oh, hey! So, I've kind of modeled my whole life after you and I've even started to grow my own moustache, you can see it if the light is just right... Enough! Hey! Why'd you do that?! He was about to say something really cool that I would have treasured forever! What could he teach you that you couldn't learn from Dr. Claw? Wait, you're not jealous of Dan, are you? Dr. Claw is jealous of no one! Jealous! Stop it! Jealous, jealous, jealous! Jealous, jealous, jealous! Talon! Wowsers. This place reminds me of the time I was trapped in an airport in Nunavut! Whoa! Look Penny, there's the banjo and the snake. Now, what is that? That must be the way to the Lost City of Diamonds! MADtana Dan will now quietly sneak off. [BRAIN GROWLS] What is it, Brain? Where is MADtana Dan? That's Doctor Dan, Penny. And I'm sure he must be around here somewhere! Maybe he went down this dark, mysterious, creepy hallway. - [PENNY] The Lost City of Diamonds! [GADGET] Wowsers! Oh Doctor Dan! We've found the Lost City of Diamonds! Yes. And by "we" you mean, "me". Soon the world's biggest diamond will belong to MAD! Onward, Charleston! Not so fast, good doctor! Why, he's begun to hallucinate! He thinks he's a MAD agent! Why does it always have to be a maze? [OOF!] [PENNY GRUNTS] [GADGET'S LEGS CREAK] Where's Doctor Dan? We need to get him to a doctor! There he is! [LAUGHS] No one has ever caught MADtana Dan! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a diamond to capture. That's strange, I could swear he was right there! [LAUGHS] He's over there! No, there! I really hate mazes. Wowsers, he sure is fast for a dehydrated and sun stroked hallucinating archaeologist. Go Go Gadget copter! Don't worry Doctor, I'll be right there in a jiffy! Go Go Gadgget first aid kit. [BOOM!] Wowsers! Now, to set the homing beacon so Dr. Claw can coming get the diamond... and me, of course. Hey! World's Lamest Archaeologist! [GOBBLES] Don't make me come up there just to throw you back down. [LAUGHS] You're too late, MADtana Dan is about to turn on the beacon! [GADGET SCREAMS] Uh, MADtana Dan will valorously escape now. Oh no. The city's falling apart! Abort mission! Whoa! Wowsers! Uncle Gadget, we have to get out of here. Don't worry Penny, Inspector Gadget has everything under control. Go Go Gadget escape plan. Woah! Woahhh! Waaahhh! [OSTRICH GOBBLES] [RUMBLING, SCREAMING] [GROANS] MADtana Dan has escaped, one more time! Proving again that no one, ever, can catch MADtana Dan! [LAUGHS] I am the best, huh... [CRASH!] Well, congratulations Gadget. All in a day's work, Chief! I'm sorry Uncle C. You were right. You're totally way cooler than MADtana Dan! I told you so. And I totally learn so much from you all the time. Yes... I know. And you're clearly the world's best bad guy. Go on... So... I'll be back, right after I rescue MADtana Dan. What?! Talooon! 
 
 [MUSIC] [DR. CLAW] So, Cuckoo Clockmaker, you say you can freeze time? You have five seconds to prove it! [GASPS] [BEEPING] [SHAZAP] It worked! [CACKLES] And with two seconds to spare! I'm sorry, Mr. SnugglePuffin. Excellent. With this technology, I'll be able to freeze everyone attending The Really Important Meeting of Really Important World Leaders in St. Moritz. Wow... that's actually a good plan. With the leaders frozen, MAD can take over the world! And I'll finally have a life-sized snow globe to add to my prized collection! [EVIL LAUGH] For serious? I saw that look! And since you're not taking my snow globes seriously, your punishment will be taking your orders from someone who does: The Cuckoo Clockmaker! That gong show?! Yes... him. Now go! [YOWL] [ALARM CLOCK BEEPING] [PENNY SNORES] Just ten more... hours. An alarm?  Have MAD agents... [YAWN] breached the perimeter? Nope. It's just Uncle Gadget... Go Go Gadget watch repair kit! [SMASH, BEEPS STOP] "Fixing" his retirement watch... [SMASH!] again. Penny, my watch has stopped. Do you have the time? Gadget! Ready for your next mission? [GROANS] But we just got back from one! Why can't the next mission be catching some sleep instead of catching bad guys? Or better yet, catching bad guys while sleeping! Justice never sleeps, Penny! Except when it was out really late the night before. [SIGHS] What's the story, Chief? [COCKOO] MAD is plotting to freeze the attendees of the Really Important Meeting of Really Important World Leaders in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Your mission is to track down their ticking Stop Clock and destroy it. This message will self-destruct. Wowzers, that mission is perfect! 'Cause we'll save the world? Because we'll fix my super-special retirement watch while we're there! [BEEPING] Let's get a move on, Penny! The clock's ticking... unlike my watch. [BOOM] [GROANS] [ACCORDEON PLAYS] [CLOCKS TICKING] Cuckoo?! Stop imitating my clocks! Get yourself a better code name! Also, you might wanna know, Inspector Gadget's on his way. Don't worry. I'm ready. I have just the thing to take care of Gadget. Behold! That's it? A watch? Who needs a watch to tell time anymore? That's what phones are for, duh. Everyone needs a watch! I have one for every occasion. This one fires lasers, this one electrocutes,  this one magnetizes ceilings... What about this one? It must do something really cool, like command an army of robots, or hypnotize sharks! [LAUGHS] No. It just tells time. [CHUCKLES]  But, this one explodes! Genius!!! Y'know, we could just call in a dozen henchmen to jump him, right? Bam! Job done. No! Claw put me in charge and I say we use my Boom-Boom watch! Now stop wasting my time and go guard the Stop Clock. That's an order. Fine, just don't blame me when the whole thing blows up in your face. [YELPS] Oh, no! [CRASH!] My clocks! Go Go Gadget snowmobile. Wowsers. Who'd a thought there'd be so much snow in the Alps? Good thing I'm an expert at driving blind! [PENNY & BRAIN WHIMPER] Hm, must have hit a bump. [SCREAMS] [CRASH] Told you I'd get us here, Penny. And right in front of a clock shop too! Hmmm... I'm picking up a definite ticking sound... but I can't tell if it's the Stop Clock or the clock shop. Try saying that five times fast! [WOOF] I'm gonna pinpoint the sound.  You watch Uncle Gadget. [GRUMBLES] Ah-ah-ah, Brain. No doggies allowed. You'd know that if you could read. [GRUMBLES] Stay. [THUMP!] [RINGS] Hello. Can I interest you in a dynamite watch? No thank you my good man. I already have a watch that I want you to fix! Oh! I'd be happy to fix it... I'd be happy to fix it real good. That's the spirit! There! You know, you should go skiing while you're here. I'm sure you'll have a blast on the slopes! Thanks for the tip and the repairs. I love it when a plan runs like clockwork. Oh, and look. It's almost "Freeze The World Leaders O'Clock!" [LAUGHS] What a nice clockmaker. He fixed my watch very promptly! [SNIFF-SNIFF] Brain?!  This is no time for fetch! [PANTING] [CODEX BEEPING] Why does it have to sound so much like my alarm clock? That's where The Really Important Meeting of Really Important World Leaders is...  so the Stop Clock must be close! There it is!  And it's set to go off at four o'clock. Here we go. Yeah, let's put the impossibly handsome teen genius on clock-sitting duty! Well, that's a great use of his MAD skillz. Not like anyone's gonna...  Wow. Hello... Ah-ha!  Time to stop the clock! Why can't there be a bad guy around when I come up with a clever line! Careful what you wish for! Talon. Of course. Sorry, there's no way I'm gonna let you mess with my uncle's plan... to turn St. Moritz into a life-sized snow globe to add to his prize winning collection... Shouldn't the plan be to freeze all the people at the Really Important Meeting of Really Important World Leaders so MAD can take over? [SIGHS] We're gonna do that too, but he's got this snow globe collection and... I know how it sounds but...  Anyhoo... [GASP!] [FIGHTING GRUNTS] Ahh! [BRAIN PANTS, BOMB BEEPS] Bad Brain! Seeing "time fly" is just a figure of speech! [HOWLS] And seeing "time snowboard" isn't a figure of speech at all! Go Go Gadget dog leash! Wowzers! Ahh! Hi-yaa! Hi-yaaah! Hai-Yaaaa-[YAWN] Did someone miss their beauty rest? [WHUD!] No, you're just boring me. [BRAIN HOWLS] Huh? Whoa! Wowers! Oof! Huh? It's been a slice, Pen. Time to say goodbye. [SPLAT! SPLAT! SPLAT!] Oh, you're really starting to tick me off... Get it?  "Tick me off!" [CHUCKLES] Like tick-tock... like a clock... Yeah, I get it, but it's lame! Yeah, like you could be lamer, like, your hair. [SIGHS] [WHIP!] [WHIP!] [SIZZLES] Whoa! Talon! What? Are you afraid that I'm gonna beat you? No, I'm worried that you're gonna trigger the detonation. Uh-oh... [SCREAMS] [SHAZAP] [SHAZAP] [BOMB BEEPS] Gotchaaaa...! [SCREAMS] I gave him one job. Y'know, "One"? Comes after "Twelve"? What a nincompoop! I need time to figure out what needs to be done! [PLINK!] That's not what I meant. [CRASH!] My super-special retirement watch! Drat! The hands are frozen. Bad dog! Ahhh, Mr. Clockmaker, before you run off. Mind fixing my watch again? Not at all... here's the problem. The hands are stuck on the explosive... [SHRIEK!] My super-special retirement watch! Go Go Gadget butterfly net! [BOOM!] [SHHHOOOOMP!] That wasn't so bad. [THUNK] [GROANS] Uncle Gadget, you beat the clock! Whoops, good thing we have an on-call clockmaker! [TALON GROANS] [SIGHS] My Stop Clock... it's... it's ruined. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time on your hands. In prison. Congratulations team, you saved the world leaders. They've extended their sincere thanks. Looks like you'll be able to sleep in soon, Penny... Finally! ...right after the next mission. And the one after that. And the one after that. My Super Special retirement watch! Uncle Gadget!  It's working again! Well of course. That nice Clockmaker just fixed it for me. [GROANS] Hey, Uncle Claw.  How 'bout a lift? Your inability to follow orders cost me my life-sized snow-globe and the leaders inside. Consider this a "time out." [GASPS] But... At least I still have the rest of my collection. [SHATTERS] [WHIMPERS]  Nooo!!!
