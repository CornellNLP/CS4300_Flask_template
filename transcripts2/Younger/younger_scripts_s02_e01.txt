 ♪ ♪ 
 Okay, not a word about anything. 
 Final decision. 
 Five minutes ago she was in the circle of trust. 
 What just happened? 
 Caitlin's gonna have enough cultural shock coming home without having to hear that her mother has a completely new identity. 
 And definitely don't mention Josh. 
 I don't even know what's going on with you two. 
 Mm, things are weird now that he knows that I'm 40. 
 J-Lo's in her 40s, and everybody in their right mind's trying to make it work with her. 
 'Cause she's J-Lo. 
 You're as hot as J-Lo. 
 Well, you're as hot as Megan Fox. 
 [chuckles] Hon, let's never stop lying to each other, okay. 
 [gasps] 
 [gasps] 
 Caitlin! 
 All : Hi! 
 [laughs] 
 Hi! 
 Hi, Caitlin! 
 Oh, I've missed you so much. 
 Ah, hi Mom. Hi Maggie. 
 Hi, give me a kiss. 
 Wow... 
 Both : Muah! 
 Someone needs a shower. 
 I got it. 
 Mom, don't be so Western. 
 All right. This is how human beings smell. 
 Oh... okay. 
 [upbeat pop music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Mom, I know it's only 9:00 a.m., but can we order pizza? 
 Seriously, I've been having erotic dreams about pizza. 
 Like, I'm about to kiss a boy and then his tongue just turns into a slice. 
 Well, girl, you're back in the land of Seamless where you can order the pizza and the boy. 
 Yes. 
 Honey, will you sit down for a second? 
 I want to share something with you. 
 Okay. 
 [sighs] 
 So while you've been in India, I've been going through a bit of an identity issue. 
 Mm. 
 Gay or transitioning? 
 What? 
 Into a man? 
 No. Why would you go there? 
 Because you're tall, and Dad always said you had man hands. 
 When did he say that? 
 I wouldn't care. 
 In India, they're known as  hijras,  and they're very accepted. 
 They're even legally recognized as a third gender on their passports, so. 
 Okay, that's good to know, but that's not my issue. 
 What is it, then? 
 The issue is... 
 [mouthing] No. 
 Brooklyn. 
 What? 
 Yes. Yes, that's it. I love it. 
 I love it, and I just don't identify with New Jersey the way that I used to. 
 Well, Mom, that's really nice, but right now I need to sleep excessively. 
 Like, for a week. 
 All right, can you please deliver the pizza to my bedroom? 
 Thank you. 
 Wow, if she was okay with a s*x change, maybe this won't be such a big deal. 
 [electronic pop music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So I'm about to pitch a book at morning meeting. 
 And I need your opinion. Sure. 
 It's a Tumblr that's being shopped around. 
 And...  [sighs] 
 You got to tell me if you think I'm crazy. 
 [rock music] 
 What do you think? 
 Uh... so many things. 
 [chuckles] Come on. 
 [whispering] Wha... 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's one of the most popular Tumblrs out there, written by a woman who's a freelance writer at "Jezebel." 
 [all chuckling] 
 [laughter] 
 Oh... 
 Excuse me. 
 How exactly is this a book? 
 It's pornographic Internet nonsense. 
 I mean, I wouldn't exactly classify oral s*x as pornography unless you're trying to throw us back to the "Let's ban 'Lolita'" era. 
 It's a list. It's not literature. 
 I agree, but it is a fun, silly book that will sell to a young audience, which is what we're after. 
 Liza? Uh, yes. 
 I mean, it's like, uh, "Goodnight Moon" for adults... 
 With blowjobs. 
 Yes. 
 [chuckles] 
 Charles? 
 I'd at least like to see some more positive thoughts. 
 Oh, of course. Um... 
 Number 69. 
 [laughter] 
 Okay, that's a start. 
 [upbeat music] 
 You're not seriously entertaining this? 
 Well, it is entertaining, but I'm not sure I can see it in the place that J.D. Salinger once called home. 
 [sighs] Oh, thank God. 
 Will I see you at the Bobby Flay meeting this afternoon? 
 He's shopping his new cookbook. 
 I think it's important you say hello. 
 Damn, I forgot to mention Bobby wanted to move the meeting to his restaurant. 
 Um, can you make that dinner tonight? 
 Um... I will have to check my calendar. 
 Probably have to rearrange a bunch of things, but... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 [funky music]

 Liza, get in here, and shut the door. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Is something wrong? 
 Charles just asked me to dinner. 
 He did? 
 Yes, at Bobby Flay's restaurant. 
 We're going to meet him about his new cookbook. 
 Oh, so it's a business dinner. 
 Are you suggesting I think it's something more? 
 Of course not. 
 I need you to download the menu and wine and cocktail list, and make sure the barman knows how to make a dry Negroni. 
 Absolutely. 
 And call Davide at Barney's. He has my sizes. 
 I need something simple and stunning. 
 Calling. [tongue clicks] 
 I'm gonna show him what a perfect power couple we can be.

 ♪ ♪ 
 So a Brunello Di Montalcino is aged at least four years, where a Rosso Di Montalcino is much younger and cheaper. 
 I think I like the Rosso better. 
 Are you in the wine business? 
 No, I just drink a lot of it. [all laugh] 
 Okay, who's over 21 here? 
 Hi, Mrs. Miller. 
 Hi, Mom. 
 We're not drinking. 
 We're just having a wine tasting. 
 Mm, Caitlin, why didn't you tell me Padma and Michaela were coming for dinner? 
 Oh, no, Mom, you don't have to cook. 
 We're going out. 
 We missed out girl. 
 We drove in from New Jersey to surprise her. 
 Where are you guys gonna go? 
 Uh, we're meeting some of Michaela's friends from NYU. 
 Are you ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Okay. Love you, Mom. 
 Love you too. 
 Thanks for the wine tasting. 
 We won't be out too late. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 We love your art. 
 Thank you. 
 Bye, Maggie. 
 Ciao. 
 Be safe. 
 Ugh, so cute. 
 Okay, what just happened there? 
 Uh, that's your daughter having a life. 
 I suggest you do the same. 
 Wh... excuse me? 
 Go see Josh. 
 You got to grab your moments while you can. 
 Ugh, I think I should give him more time. 
 Time to do what? Go meet somebody else? 
 That might be for the best. 
 I mean, I... I worry that I really may not be the person that he fell in love with Liza, don't reject yourself. 
 Okay? 
 Dude, come on. 
 No, dude, just wait... 
 Ooh. 
 [chuckles] 
 Ah! 
 All right, stop. 
 Stop. 
 Nope. Nope. 
 Not mid-mission.

 Ah, it's Liza. 
 What? 
 She wants to do something tonight. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The answer is no. 
 Dude, what is your problem? 
 Wha... are you kidding me? She's a nut job. 
 She should be locked up in some sort of cougar prison. 
 Dude, that is...  [laughs] 
 That's not true. 
 Come on, man. 
 She stepped on your heart. She destroyed your soul. 
 She's a sexual grifter. 
 Will you just give me my phone back? 
 Fine... but don't expect me to be around to pick up the pieces. 
 [sighs] 
 Can I eat the dumplings? 
 Okay, I'm getting the three dots. 
 Will someone please explain the dots to me? 
 I think the dots are when someone's typing or thinking. 
 Okay, now the dots went away. There's nothing. 
 Oh, the dots can be very fickle. 
 They're back. 
 Yes! East River Bar at 9:00. 
 Oh, I don't know. What if Caitlin comes home? 
 Hm, don't worry. I'll keep her distracted. 
 Nobody cock blocks mama.

He's not so mature, and he can't process all of his emotions. You knew that was the risk in telling him the truth. Yeah, but I had to tell him. And you know what, maybe I deserved that tonight. [scoffs] Besides, it's one less thing I have to explain to Caitlin... who, by the way, I should never have let go out tonight by herself. Uh, she just spent the past six months in India.
