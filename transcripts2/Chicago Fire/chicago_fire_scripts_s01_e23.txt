 We have multiple victims. 
 I got one! Previously on Chicago Fire...  I just heard from the State's Attorney. Voight's out. He was promoted to Sergeant, and he's running the Intelligence Unit. You're in the intelligence unit. Don't I know it? There's been a lot of bad blood between cops and firemen in this district. I wanna be the first to put it all behind us. [Siren wails] Your names? Barnes. Sermons. Hey! Listen, Shay, I'm sorry. A baby isn't an afterthought, Kelly. I know that. I still haven't come clean with him about Boden and his mom, and it just feels like this dark cloud hanging over us. You knew about this how long? I know I should've told you sooner, but you have to see it from my point of view. Do I? Is that what I need to do, Dawson? That's weird. Oh, yeah, I know about this. I'll take care of it. Okay. Everything good? [Siren wails] It's Hallie's clinic. Hallie! Come on! Breathe. [Sobs] We were scheduled to open our bar after next shift. And in light of what happened, we were gonna push it. But... me and Dawson and Otis...  We talked about it, and instead, we're gonna make it a celebration of Hallie's life. All the proceeds for tonight will be donated in her name to Children's Memorial. Thanks. Not an easy day. Not for any of us. Lieutenant Casey is meeting with detectives from CPD. Arson investigators are at the clinic right now. All we can do for Matt is be there the best we can. [Background chatter] Hey. Lieutenant Casey. I'm here to see Detective Dawson. [Laughs] We got a fireman in the house. Look at him, well-rested and fed. Must be nice being a fireman, washing fire trucks...  Sarge, Sarge. The DOA from the clinic fire...  Lieutenant Casey was her boyfriend. Ah. That's my bad. Detective Julie Willhite. Intelligence. Hi, I'll take upstairs? All right, yeah. Those two guys we flipped had scrips on 'em. I'm so sorry, man. Thanks. So where are we at? I just got off the phone...  I don't deal with you. I deal with Antonio. M.E. report came in. Hallie was struck in the back of the head and killed before the fire started. Units in 21, foot man on Taylor Street. Just confirmed sighting of your silver Magnum. 1400 block of West Taylor. That's the car that fled the clinic fire. This is 2121. Silver Magnum's been located going east on Taylor. We're not on Taylor. I know. [Tires screech] [Siren whoops] [Horn honks] Blocked on racine. They bailed out! We're in pursuit. [Dog barks] Seriously? [Tires screech] [Horn honks] [Tires screech] [Horn honks] Ahh! [Cries] Stay down! [Groans and coughs] Aw, please. [Taser buzzes] [Groans] You good? What do we got? A couple oxy heads and a handful of priors for armed robbery, mostly around UIC. They're saying they knew the car was hot, but they bought it from a black male for 500 and were gonna use it for a couple days to do some stickups and then dump it. [Groaning] He resisted. She kicked me in the balls. Cry me a river. They're denying any involvement in the clinic. There's no arson or bodily harm on either of their records. Who's the brains of the outfit? That guy. Bring him over here. Who'd you buy the car from? Black dude named "Shorty." Oh. Shorty. Shorty. Get him outta here. Come on. Looks like a lot of cars we'd find in narcotics. Generic dummy plates. A lot of 'em have traps built in to move the dope and cash. Okay. There we go. So what does this mean? Who are we looking for? Someone who was moving major dope. Hey. Hey. Um, on the heels of all this, I was thinking that, you know, God forbid something were to happen to either one of us, that maybe we should have something written up legally in terms of who would take care of the baby. Absolutely. And speaking of, we go in tomorrow. Casey's heading back down to the fire scene with the detectives. I'm coming. And I'll...  I'll be there. Yeah. That's so nice of you. Thank you. Bye. Optical shop on the corner is gonna donate a couple pairs of sunglasses to raffle off. Great. And as soon as Zoya starts, she can help go collect all this stuff. Who? Uh, my cousin. From Russia? Zoya? We talked about this. When? At the soft opening? What? When I got, like, six beers in me? Hey, you signed off, dude. Do you know anything about this? First I've heard of it. Okay, uh, she's here on a six-month work visa. But apparently, the nanny job was killing her. She's nice, she's cute, she's got restaurant experience, and you agreed to it. What kind of restaurant? Who cares? It's fine. She's in. We got funds to raise. You guys are killing me. Ah, you'll love her. Thank you very much. Sure, Chief. How you holdin' up? Best I can. There's no security video. Two of the cameras were fake. The other had no database. Arson is saying it doesn't look like a break-in. Same director of this clinic runs another over on wabash. Let's take a look. Thanks, Chief. This is the ignition point. Patient prescription records. Actually...  Hallie... right before we went to lunch, she was standing there looking at something, and... and she said, "that's weird." I just figured it was about billing or something. Main to Battalion 25, Truck 81, Squad 3, and Ambulance 61, responding...  No, no. Civilian in distress. Your head's not in the game right now. I'll cover for you. He can roll with us. Battalion 25 en route. Copy that. Not a problem. [Sirens wail] I swear I heard screaming down there. [Running water splashes] Help! Get your lights! Here! Voice came from over there. Watch yourself. Water's moving fast. Chief, down there! I don't think I can hold on much longer! Hang on. We're gonna get you out. Get your webbing out. Secure it to this handle. I'll hold the line. Don't let go. Be careful. Watch that current. I got you. Can't move! Talk to me, Kelly. Chief! Both her feet are sucked into a drain. We got one victim pinned in. I'm gonna need a rescue rope and scuba gear in the west end of the tunnel right now. Something's cutting my leg. Chief. Suction's trapping debris at her feet. I got her. I gotta dive down, get you clear. Please... please don't let me die down here. Please. I got you. Come on! [Cries] They're over here! Got some clear, but I need more time. We don't have it. Severide! We need the scuba gear over here now. I got it! Get my mask. Hey, I'm gonna put this mask over your face. It's gonna help you breathe under the water. [Woman whimpering] Just hold still. You got air? Get it on... whoa, whoa, whoa! She's going under! You got her, Chief? I got her. I got her. The water level's rising. Hey, hey. I got the debris clear, but the suction's keeping her down. We need to pull her up. Get the webbing on now. Under her arm. Severide, feed that under her arm. Watch the mask... you got her? She's ready to go. Easy, easy. Grab the webbing! Hang on. Ready? One, two... pull! Watch her head. [Overlapping yelling] Grab her legs. You got her? Watch the tank. I got it, Chief. You okay, kid? Look at me. Sucking down that river, huh? Okay, we got you, girl. Let's go! You good, Chief? We're good! Nice work. You too. Let's get the hell out of here. Do you recognize either one? I've never seen them before. Any problems with anyone at the clinic? Not with our employees. Everybody works, and volunteers are here because they care. They... they wanna give back. Patients? Let's just say a few bad apples have walked through that door. Anyone specifically? Who might kill Hallie? Oh, I... I'm... I don't know. Two of the security cameras were fake. I'm... I'm just trying to keep the doors open. You know, it's a lot of things I can't afford that I'd like to. The fire was started near prescription records. Our guess: Someone tried to cover up some impropriety. Those scrips are for a hell of a lot of oxycontin. For you, maybe. Not for someone in pain. Any problems with your prescription drugs? Any missing inventory? Not that I know of. We have a drug cage, and there's never been a problem. Mr. Gooding, we're gonna need a list of employees, patients...  And I'm gonna have to stop you right there. We are dealing with protected health information, uh, potential HIPAA violations, insurance, liabilities, blah, blah, blah. It's gonna have to go through our legal department. If your clinic was a pill mill and Hallie found out about it and someone killed her to shut her up, now... right now... would be the time to tell us. [Scoffs] It's not a pill mill. [Sighs] Okay, look. Um... there was this guy, Jubal Bartlett. He was a drug dealer. His girlfriend came in with a broken jaw. We reported it to the police. He did not take it kindly. He made threats. We'll be back. [Tv announcer in background] So Zoya, this is Hermann and Dawson. Nice to meet you. Guys, this is Zoya. Hey, so nice to meet you. Hello. [Chuckles] So Brian said that you've got some restaurant experience. Thank you. [Speaking Russian] Uh, um... [Speaking Russian] [Both speak Russian] Uh, anyway, so I just wanna make some quick introductions, and we will see you at the bar. Ooh. We've got Yakov Smirnoff tending bar now? Who's that? Um, so for the opening and the benefit, I'm pretty sure she said she's gonna bring a monkey. [Chuckles] A monkey? Yep. Otis. Look, it's probably some sort of good luck gesture or... or, you know, it has some sort of cultural significance. What's the worst that could happen? Did you see the lady on Oprah  who got her face chewed off by a monkey? I did see that. And if it looks like it could take us, I'll tell her to keep it in the car. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I've got the word out to all my CIs. Nothing yet. Yeah, and none of the neighbors saw or heard anything prior to the fire. Subpoena will get us employee and patient records in a couple hours. What about the drug dealer the clinic director turned us on to? Can't find him. Can't find him? Ran him through NCIC and the FBI to see if he got pinched anywhere else. What's this drug dealer's name? Yeah, it's probably best we don't tell you. You know, we don't want you... doing something rash. I understand that you and Hallie broke up before her death. Is that right? For a few months. Yeah. She see anyone in that gap? No one serious. Did she ever mention anyone that she felt uncomfortable around? Was afraid of? Yeah. You. Lieutenant, I am sympathetic to what you're going through. I don't believe that for a second. Fine. Don't. But I have allowed you to be here as a courtesy. Courtesy. From you? I don't need it. I want you to find out who killed my girl! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. All right? You gotta chill out, bro. Voight isn't gonna lift a finger unless someone pays him under the table. I got my eye on him, okay? He's working the case. Go back to the firehouse and cool off. No. I'm staying here. You're not. Wait to hear from me. Go on. Okay, there's what would happen if both of us died...  Who would take care of the baby? Yeah, we should figure that out. Dawson, right? Yeah. Okay. What is it? I'm just excited. Me too. And part of me feels horrible 'cause of what Casey's going through. Here I am with butterflies in my stomach 'cause I'm getting ready to get pregnant, and...  [Alarm beeps] Ambulance 61. Gunshot victim. Neighbors reported shots fired. 30-year-old female, single gunshot to the stomach. Actually, that's a guess. It's hard to tell. There's a lot of blood. She was pumping out pretty good. I applied pressure, but I don't know what's going on. It's okay. I got it. Not feeling anything. She's gone. I'm calling it. 61 to main, victim is DOA. We're delayed on scene while we document for CPD. Dawson. She was a nurse at the clinic Hallie worked at. Hey. What the hell's going on? That's what we're trying to find out. How's he been? Busy, like everybody on this case. I'll get at you later. Boo. In on it? Or she found out who was. Neighbor only heard the gunshot. No one on either side saw anyone leave. But we can keep knocking on doors. Willhite. Do that. Thanks. The drug dealer, Jubal Bartlett? He's been locked up in Virginia Beach for the past four days on a possession charge. I want that clinic director in the hot seat now. I told his lawyer I was gonna issue an arrest warrant for obstruction by the end of the week if he didn't get his client to honor the meet. Man, whoever did these two hits will be long gone by the end of the week. This ain't the Gang Unit, Voight. Sarge. You can't do everything with a battering ram. The hell I can't. Don't worry. I got him handled. I noticed. Oh, my God. What? I just took this baby-proofing quiz. We live in a death trap. Spiral staircase, upper floor apartment with accessible balconies...  Are you giving birth tomorrow? Listen, we have time to make any fixes we need. We need a locked liquor cabinet. Remind me. Okay. 
 
 Leslie Shay? Hi. Here we go. All right. Will you rub my belly for good luck? Just...  Relax. All right. You ready? Yeah. Feeling fertile. Feeling fertile. Okay. We'll make sure of that. Okay. A monkey? Why is everybody acting like she said she's gonna bring a unicorn? Yes, a monkey. Why? Ask her when she gets here. Ask Otis to ask her. She doesn't speak English. Oh...  It's serviceable. [Laughs] You gotta go White Sox. No, I don't wanna alienate half the neighborhood who are Cubs fans. We gotta go with teams that we can all agree on: The Bears, the Bulls, and the Blackhawks. And the Fire? The who? Soccer team. Chicago Fire. Who knew? Okay, sure, fine. Get a banner. [Both chuckle] [Cell phone vibrates] Hey. Thanks for coming. Of course. Um...  I've been thinking about everything, you know? And, uh, I'm waiting for this...  I guess anger to go away. It's not. And I'm not mad at you. But I do have to say I wish you would've told me when you found out. Yeah, I know you do. All I can say is that I... I just felt stuck 'cause I didn't wanna hurt you, and... and it wasn't my business. But it was your business. I was your boyfriend. Was? I think I need some time. Look, I respect you too much to have you twisting in the wind, wondering where my head's at. Oh, man...  I mean... [Clears throat] I knew this was a possibility if I told you, but...  I still love you. I do. But this whole thing just...  I guess it's just... a little deeper than I thought. Well, you need to figure it out, Pete, one way or another. I know. [Sniffles] I gotta go. Uh-oh. Voight's here. Everybody hide your wallets! Hey, what's up, Pru? There it is.  You gotta be the luckiest son of a bitch I ever met. How do you walk around all day with that horseshoe in your ass? [Laughs] Just living the dream. I guess you are. Yeah. Anything for me, man, in narcotics? [Sighs] Nothing yet, man. We set a bunch of controlled buys up. But nothing, man. Not even a vitamin. CIs have nothing, either. Don't know what to tell you. Mm. Prints came back on that Magnum. Calvin Jackson. Goes by "CJ." Extensive sheet for dealing, including oxy. We're headed over to grab him up. No, no. I'll take care of it. Great work. [Muffled rap music] ♪ ♪ [Indistinct chatter] [Chuckles] I heard that. [Laughs] Yeah, you know it, man. Look at this. What's up, Mo? I knew they couldn't keep you down. Hey, man, not in this lifetime. We got a little problem with your nephew CJ. We got his prints on a car that booked it from that clinic fire a few days back. Was he involved? What if he was? I don't like guessing games. He was buying prescrips from some dude who was working with a nurse inside and the guy who ran the clinic. Next thing I know, CJ comes back all tweaked. He was at the clinic doing a pickup when the place caught fire. So he bounced. The name of the dude. CJ didn't say, and I didn't ask. He did say that this guy ain't right in the head. Like, white-boy-serial-killer crazy. Second thing: He knows about me and you. And how would my name come up, Mo? CJ told him you gave us protection. So if you lock him up and he starts runnin' his trap, that ain't good for any of us. You know what I'm sayin'? You get CJ on the phone, and get me the name of that guy. Nah, CJ is gone. I told him to dump his phone and clear out for a bit. You know how I work. This is your problem now. Five stacks. A little welcome-back gift. So you can start the college fund when, um, the baby's born. And it's only, like, 5 dollars a month. Even if they don't go to college, they still get the money. So I'm not quite sure why they call it a college fund. It's... really, it's just a... a fund for when they turn 18. So...  Are you okay? [Laundry machine hums] Um... [Sniffles] Mills broke up with me. Oh, my God. Over the Boden thing? Yeah. [Sighs] What an idiot. I'm sorry, sweetie. [Sniffles] [Knocks on window] I was gonna call him, but then it felt like that was the easy way out. So I drove over. And her parents were having a dinner party. Hallie's sister was there, her kids, her parents' friends, all of 'em. It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I'm so sorry, Matt. You know, I appreciate this. [Laughs] I needed it. You know, when Andy died... without even realizing it, I found myself needing to be around people acting normal just to get my frame of reference back and pull myself out of the hole I was in. So whenever you wanna grab a smoke, or hit golf balls, or whatever...  Casey. Antonio and Detective Willhite are here for you. We're waiting on the nurse's cell phone records, fingerprints from her apartment. But we're not homicide, so we can be a little more aggressive. Good. We cooked up something. You go in to the clinic director. He knows your Hallie's boyfriend, right? Right. You tell him you were going through her computer at home. She spelled out the whole thing. She also mentioned the director was a good guy and probably was forced into this. And after that you don't say a word, 'cause he'll either take the bait and give us the name of his accomplice, or he won't. We'll be outside, so if anything goes sideways, we're right there. He'll be wearing a wire? That's right. How do we know this director isn't the trigger man and he pulls a gun? We wouldn't be here if we thought that was a valid scenario. But can we guarantee your safety 100%? No. I don't care. I'm in. All right, here we go. He's walking into the clinic. This is sermons. We're tucked away and standing by. [Sighs] [Computer beeps] Prints came back from the nurse's apartment. Timothy Campbell. Whoa. What? Armed robbery, drug possession, assault with a deadly weapon. How you doin'? I'd like to talk to Steve Gooding? He's in a meeting. You know when he'll be out? I don't. [Man shouting, muffled] Mind if I wait until he's done? [Gunshots] [Screaming] Go! [Siren wails] [Horns honk] Chicago police! Get down! [Screaming] Move! Casey! [Horn honks] Casey! [Horns honk] [Siren wails] [Horns honk] Casey! El platform. [Tires screech] Police! Get down! Get down! Police! [People screaming] Police! Get down! Casey! Casey! [Horns honk] [Tires screech] [Horns honk] Clear, right. [Horns honk] [Overlapping shouting] [Tires screech] [Horn honks] Stay with it. Stay with it. [Horns honk] [Gunshot] [Screaming] Freeze! Let him go! Drop the gun, Campbell! I swear to God, I'll blow his head off. That ain't happenin'.  Put it on the ground!  I'm not dropping my gun! Here, look...  Okay? Now, you gotta do the same for me. Voight. Wait, you're Voight? Thank God. Tell them...  [Gunshot] King 84-10, emergency. King 84-10. Go with your emergency. Shot fired by police. Roll an ambulance to the El platform on Kinzie and Wells. Officer not hit. Offender down. Gunshot wound to head. Copy that, 84-10. Bus is on the way. Nice shot. And yep. He be dead. We'll hand it over to the M.E. Thanks. Any way you can get back into vice? I would if I wanted to. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. And check out those names on the sheet. See if you like any of those. Yeah. Oh, I saw online that recording an agreement is also beneficial. That way, if there's ever a disagreement, instead of looking at a bunch of words you can see yourself talking to the present you and advising yourself to behave rationally and fairly. So what do you think? Um...  I think Molly's is opening up tonight. [Laughs] Have a baby first, deal with this later? Sounds good. Doors open in an hour. I think we got it all covered, right? You're all set, man. The place looks great. [Speaking Russian] Monkey's here. Are we insured for this? I'm not even joking. [Speaking Russian] That's the Stanley cup. [Speaking Russian] [Mimics monkey] [Speaking russian] [Laughs] [Both speak Russian] So I guess in Russian, "chimpanzee" and "hockey championship" are this close phonetically. [Chuckles] That's the Stanley Cup. Hank. 5k. Guy's name is Maurice Owens. Mid-level dealer. It's all in the report. Strange bedfellows, huh? This is a good start. Keep putting yourself out there as dirty. Who knows what fish we'll catch in the net, right? I want a receipt for the cash when you're done with your inventory. You don't trust me, Hank? I want it by tomorrow. Keep in touch. [Overlapping chatter, music plays] Cancan I chug a beer out of it? No, you know what? I'm good, I'm good. Get in here. [Laughs] Hey. Hey. How you doing? How you doing? I'm good. Hey. Thanks for coming. You look great. Thanks. Hi. How are you? Good. Good? Mm-hmm. Gary, good to see you. Really. How you doin'? Good to see you. [Laughs] This is the real thing? Yeah. I, uh... one of our first dates was a...  Blackhawks-Devils game. When she told me she knew what icing was, I knew I had a keeper. [Crowd chuckling] Yeah, this means a lot, guys... and it means a lot to her, 'cause I'm sure she's looking down. To Hallie. All : To Hallie.
