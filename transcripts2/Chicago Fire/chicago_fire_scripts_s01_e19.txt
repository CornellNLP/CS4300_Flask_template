 Previously on Chicago Fire... 
 This house is special. 
 Why? 
 Because it has a Rescue Squad. 
 They're like the best of the best. 
 Why aren't you with them? 
 I plan to be. 
 My father was a member of the Squad years ago. 
 You know I've done thorough research on this whole insemination thing. 
 Kelly, I wanna know if you'd like to have a baby with me. 
 I want to hear, you know? 
 I need to know how my dad died. 
 In the middle of that fire, your father panicked and pulled off his mask. 
 So I could not in good faith reward someone for demonstrating cowardice... 
 [Men shouting] 
 Listen, I know it's been on your mind, and I think you'd be a really great addition to the Squad. 
 Let's push it, see what happens. 
 Okay. 
 We don't have to be alone. 
 Why can't we be happy? 
 Andy was one of my best friends, and he was your husband, and I think we should honor that. 
 Hey. 
 I am so sorry. I completely zonked out. 
 No worries. I didn't want to wake you. 
 What time is it? 
 Uh, 7:00. 
 Oops, I have to pick up the boys from grandma's. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, the baking dish is still dirty, so I'm gonna wash it. 
 I'll clean it. 
 Matt. 
 I saw this swing set fort type thing at True Value. 
 I've been meaning to build it for Griffin and Ben. 
 I'll bring it and the dish by after shift. 
 If that's cool with you. 
 Thank you, you're... that's very sweet. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Mind if I use your bathroom? 
 Of course. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 My dad wanted me to drop that off. 
 His way of apologizing for you catching that elbow. 
 Thanks. 
 All right, well, I'll see you at the house. 
 Do you have any mouthwash? 
 Uh... it's not... 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 It's not what you think! 
 Yeah. I'm sure you've got it all figured out. 
 [Slams car door, engine starts] 
 Hey! Any of you guys know John Pritchard, or are you all too young? 
 He was gone before I came on, but I heard stories. 
 Piece of work, that one. 
 What, he died or something? 
 Yeah! 
 You know, Boden, Mouch and me, we all knew him back in the day. 
 He must have been 20 years older than Boden if that tells you anything. 
 What did he die of? 
 Old man stuff. I don't know. 
 Funeral is tomorrow up at Grayslake. 
 Are you guys going? 
 Yeah, I guess, you know? We should pay our respects. 
 All right. Hydrant's good to go. 
 Peter Mills, you get to flush the next one. 
 [Groans] 
 By the way, saikensha wa saimusha yori kioku yoshi. 
 What the hell's that? 
 You bet me I couldn't say a sentence in Japanese. 
 I just said one. 
 You owe me 20 bucks. 
 Okay. "A", I don't remember that. 
 And "B", how do I know you're not just speaking gibberish? 
 It's a sentence. 
 What's it mean? 
 Pay me 20 bucks, I'll tell you. 
 Ridiculous. You tell me and... 
 Help! Help! 
 He fell! 
 We were playing hide and seek upstairs. 
 [Groans] 
 Hang on. 
 We're coming. 
 [Strangled grunts] 
 This is 81. I need a paramedic across from our firehouse! 
 What's the address? 
 Look for our lights! 
 Let's go, bro! Hit it! 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Strangled grunts] 
 His neck's twisted. He can't breathe. 
 I told Taye not to go in the chute! 
 He knows better! 
 Come with me. 
 All right, we have to get through this block. 
 [Buzzing] 
 [Crying] 
 [Sirens] 
 61, we need you on the second floor. 
 It's a child. 
 What's going on? 
 Kid hid in the laundry chute. 
 Mills, get in here. 
 Yeah! 
 Dougie? 
 [Cries] I told him infinity times not to hide in there. 
 [Cries] 
 Come on. 
 Taye? 
 Ma'am. 
 Ma'am, don't look. 
 [Whimpering] 
 We'll get him out. Let them work. 
 Dougie... 
 Honey, go upstairs. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, God. 
 Don't look. 
 [Cries] 
 [Grunts] 
 Grab his legs. 
 He's losing consciousness. 
 Taye! 
 Grab his legs. 
 Taye. 
 Let's board him quickly. 
 Hold on to me. 
 [Sobbing] 
 One, two, three. 
 [Grunts] 
 You the mother? 
 Yes. 
 You can ride in the back with me. Let's go. 
 Go on. 
 I'll be right back. 
 What have you heard? 
 Um... the doctor says it looks bad. 
 It's a damaged windpipe, so his brain was without oxygen. 
 Well, they've got great surgeons here. 
 They'll do everything they can. 
 You know... 
 Taye has been to your firehouse. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 His whole class went on a field trip last fall when the school year started. 
 It was all he could talk about for days. 
 [Chuckles] 
 He said he wants to be a fireman, help people. 
 That's... that's sweet. 
 Gangs are always calling, but he won't bite. 
 He's gonna be straight and narrow, and I believe that. 
 I'm sure he will. 
 Thank you. 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 I don't know if I can handle another season like the last one. 
 Hope Springs eternal. 
 Hope never met a Sox September. 
 Yeah, well at least you guys have a series win in the last century. 
 Try being a Cubs fan. 
 There's plenty of room on the bandwagon if you want to move to the south side. 
 Yeah. 
 What are you, Pouch? You Cubs or Sox, huh? 
 Look at her feet. 
 She's definitely a white Sox fan. 
 Guys, put a cork in it. 
 I'm trying to listen to the Hawk. 
 Saikensha wa saimusha yori kioku yoshi. 
 What does that mean? 
 Hey, if they score, come get me. 
 [Muttering] Saikensha... 
 Sai... Hey, Lieutenant. I want to bring you up to speed on what Kelly's just filled me in on. I'm gonna push to fast-track Peter Mills to Squad. The youngest anyone's ever made it was 23. You. I think Mills can break the record. And I talked to Chief Walker over at District, and he thinks it would be great for CFD morale. Is that what you think, Chief? Great for morale? As long as he qualifies. Well, sounds like you guys have all the answers. You wanted to see me, Chief? As you're aware, Lieutenant Severide thinks that you'll make a strong addition to Rescue Squad. Yes. I just want to hear your take on it. I'm gonna bust my ass to make it happen. Why? I'm sorry? Why's it so important to you? 'Cause I want to be an elite firefighter, sir. And this has got nothing to do with your father? No, sir. This has nothing to do with what my father did or did not do with his time at CFD. This is about me. Well, since you've been here you've put on ten pounds. Which, from where I sit, doesn't look like a candidate willing to bust his ass. [Door closes] Hey, how's it going? Been better. You need me to take care of someone? Give me a name. Not now. Heather Darden and me, we're just friends. She came over to talk and fell asleep on my couch. Right. Got it. I don't know what you want me to say here. I saw what I saw, Casey. Sell your clean whistle act to someone else, 'cause I ain't buying. You can't imagine you might be wrong about something, can you? I can imagine a lot of things, just not the idea of you rolling around with Andy's widow. Come on. Explain to me why Heather barely talks to me, but she'll sleep with you, even though you're the guy who put her husband through that window? [Gunshots] Get down! Get down! What the hell is going on here? [Tires squealing] You okay? Yeah. Curtis, are you okay? Yeah. This has always been a neighborhood's house. You tell me. No run-ins recently? No fires where one of your guys tried to pop off to the local... No. We're not cops. People are happy to see a firefighter show up. Could this be Voight related? Voight? When it comes to gang violence, the man has a long reach. He's got a dismissal hearing soon. Not like Voight to stir up the nest if he's trying to free himself. Man, why don't you pick up one of these bangers for something small and trade the bust for what they know about the shooters? Corner boys in this neighborhood are good. We can't catch them with the drugs and make a bust stick. We'll keep our ears to the ground. In the meantime, I'll make sure we have a conspicuous police presence around the station. Meaning what? Put a special detail on it. Squad outside. Officer posted in the house. Well, that's fine. So long as the men are safe. What? Cops in the house is a bad precedent. Sends a message to the good residents around here that we're not a safe haven. You rather have one of us be killed? Of course not. We will let the police handle their business, and we... will handle ours. [Police radio chatter] Never seen anything like this before. So much for being the neighborhood's house. Here you go. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. 
 
 Hey, any word on that kid pulled out of the laundry chute? Haven't heard anything yet. Hey, what's going on with you and Casey? It seemed like... Oh, I don't... I don't want to talk about Casey. Okay, fine. We'll just enjoy watching you two mark your territory. So what do you want to talk about? So how would this work? With the, um... insemination? Well, basically, you know, I'd get a hormone injection once a day for 12 days to boost ovulation, then we'd go to a clinic where they have rooms set aside for collection. Meaning, you know, they give you magazines or whatever, and you go in and do you business. I mean, I get that part. [Chuckles] How much does it cost? Uh, all-in, 10 grandish. 10 grand, are you serious? Yeah. You have that kind of cash? I'm gonna stretch some card limits and cobble it together. I'm in. [Both laughing] What? You picked him up first? Just get in. Now I gotta stare at the back of your head for an hour? Yeah. Guess it's better than getting shot at at the firehouse. [Both chuckle] [Laughter] So I come home, try to climb in through the window, but it's shut. It's locked. Oh, okay. I thought I got a clean getaway, but no. Now I gotta go around and ring on the damn doorbell. [Laughter] My old man, he's just sitting in his chair. Waiting for me. For hours. 3:00 in the morning. Alcohol on my breath. Ooh! He just stares at me, hard as nails. He says, "boy, you got four choices where you're going to college... Army, Navy, air force, marines... pick one." Wow! [Scoffs] At least your old man gave a damn. Oh, Bill Herrmann wasn't so bad. I'm friends with Chris's older brother Larry. Your dad would throw the ball with us when he was home. Larry did not disappoint him the way that I did. You never told me about your dad. Aw, sold luggage to department stores all over the midwest. He was on the road more than he was home. Is that right? He wanted me to chase him into the business like my brother Larry did, so naturally I took the fireman's test. [Chuckling] They got this whole thing... Larry and my dad. I don't talk to him that much anymore. You should call him. I should. It'd be that much worse when he didn't call me back. What are you doing here? Maybe being quiet and keeping to yourself is how it works in the Mills family, but that's not how the Dawsons do it. Is that so? Look, if you want to fly solo, you better do it in bed with your eyes closed, okay? But you want to train for Squad, you better get ready to talk while you run, 'cause I'm coming with you. Hey. I want to be a part of whatever comes your way. Well, then you better tie your shoes first. Oh! [Laughs] [Laughs] Oh, I'm gonna get you! This is the right time, right? Paper said 3:30. Excuse me, is this the Pritchard funeral? Yes. Yes. We're about to get underway. Oh. Have a seat. Thanks. Thanks. Are you kidding me with this? Didn't he have, like, five sons? Yeah. Where's his family? Welcome, friends. We're all here today not to grieve but to celebrate the life of... John Aaron Pritchard. Matthew 5:4 says, "blessed are they who mourn. For they shall be comforted." Let's get outta here. Amen. So, like, I mean, that's it? I mean... half a dozen people, and no family, and a preacher who doesn't even know his name without looking at the program. I mean, where's the truck with a half-raised ladder and salute to a fallen firefighter? Chris... No, I'm serious. What's my funeral gonna be like when I kick it? Or yours, Mouch, huh? Doubt I'll care. All the same, he deserved a funeral with respect for all of his service. And just because he waited a dozen years to die and moved out to the sticks doesn't mean he wasn't a hero. Let's go. Shotgun! This... this ain't right! Grr! Any words on the shooters? Nada. How was the funeral? What's worse than terrible? It was that. [Groans] What? Oven's busted. What? Blender is too. [Buzzing] Bad news. Remember that kid from last shift? Jumped in the laundry chute?-e Yeah. Didn't make it. He came here, this kid. He was here on a class field trip. He told his mom he wanted to be a fireman when he got home. Wow, I recognize him. It was my first day. You guys had me give the tour. [Exhales] Man, I remember that. Funeral's on Friday. Hey, pop, it's Christopher. Just checking in. I know it's been a while, and... anyway, just call me back. You know what the worst part is? What is the worst part, Kelly? That you don't have enough sack to admit you're sleeping with Heather. At least come clean. Keep walking. I'm done explaining myself. You haven't explained a damn thing! That's the point! 'Cause you're wrong! Don't come up on me again like this. Really? What the hell is going on here? In my office... now. [Object clatters] We've been here before. Almost tore this house apart. This time, it's different. Tell me about it. Yeah, Casey, tell him about it. No offense, Chief. So what do you think about this whole Casey/Heather thing? Uh... I don't know. Hmm. You haven't asked him? We've said like two sentences to each other in a month. Hey. What's your name? Phillip. [Laughs] All right, let's get you up, Phillip. Come on. Here we go. Whoa! Whoa! Phillip, that is not the kind of full moon I was expecting to see today. [Laughs] Come on. Here we go. All right, keep your pants up. Whew! So Severide's little swimmers, huh? Yeah. And who's paying for this? [Sighs] I don't know. You know, there's another, cheaper alternative. Oh, come on. What? I'm just saying. Oh, boy. Nature has already worked out a lot of these details. [Engine revving] [Tires squealing] I need a 10-1 to East Van Buren, now! Where's your location? Someone's stealing our ambulance! [Tires screeching] Hey! What the hell? Pull over! Shut up! You can't steal an ambulance! I said shut up! Listen to me, moron. Quit talking to me! [Horn honking] This ambulance has GPS! They can track us in the city so they know where we're at at all times! When you hear the beep, that means that they're about to shut down the engine! What are you talking about? They're gonna turn off the engine, lock up the tires, and send your face flying through the windshield! [Sirens approaching] That ain't true! [Police sirens wailing] Here it comes! [Beeping] You should buckle up! [Beeping continues] Damn it! [Tires screeching] [Police radio chatter] [Siren whoops] Somebody call for an ambulance? Come on, Phillip. Hey. Hey. [Clears throat] I know this may not be the best time, um... but I have a new proposal. So please don't say anything or make any funny faces. Okay. Okay. Uh... I can't afford the insemination. So I've been thinking about plan "B". And I propose... when the time is right, you go into your room with magazines or Skinemax or whatever you need to get yourself ready. And then with the lights out, you signal me by calling out my name once. You'll hear your door open, footsteps. And then you'll be mounted. You will finish your business inside of me as quickly and efficiently as possible. And then I'll be out the door, so you can clean up or whatever you need to do. At which point, I will need to be alone. Most likely to cry. And we will never speak of this to anyone ever for the rest of our lives. And... I thank you for listening. Just think about it. [Cell phone buzzes] Here we go. Here we go. What the hell are you doing? I'm not standing near any windows. Well, it ain't exactly easy to watch the ballgame with you staring back at me. You think the shooters are going to text you before they open fire? I broke down and called my old man. I got nothing back. Mills, what's for lunch? Oh, um, I was bringing in some beef tips, but I don't think they're gonna taste that good raw, so we can do some pimento cheese sandwiches... How about Al's beef? Okay, all right. We'll do Al's beef. Call it in. I will. Oh, Otis! Yeah? Uh, saikensha wa saimusha yori kioku yoshi. Seriously, up yours, Mouch. Hey, you know who knows how to translate that? Andrew Jackson. [Laughs] Dawson, where's Shay? Uh, I don't know. This is Tara Little. She's a candidate. She's gonna be riding along with you guys for the next few shifts for evaluation. Cool. Hey, so nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Oh, don't pay any attention to what these guys have to say. Especially Frick and Frack over here. Oh, which one's Frick? Come on. What's that? Oh, it's... yeah, I keep the cooking club cash hidden here. That's cool, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. I'll get the food. No, I don't mind. I'll grab it. I got it. I want to talk to whoever's in charge. Nah, get back in your truck. I'm not a cop. I'm not armed. Nah, man, get back in your truck. I just want to talk. [Game sounds on tv] [Clears throat] You in charge? Who wants to know? I'm the Lieutenant at firehouse 51 down the street. So? Someone tried to pop a couple shots into our house in broad daylight. Could have killed someone. Someone who works to protect this neighborhood every single day. Now I know why. You guys hide your drugs in the hydrants, don't you? Look, we have to flush those hydrants twice a year. Otherwise one of these buildings is on fire... yours maybe. It burns down because there's no water in our hoses. You know, I'm not stupid enough to think that you're gonna give up selling your junk because I come in here, but I'm telling you, you hide it in the hydrants, it's gonna get flushed. You done? No. Like it or not, we all gotta coexist here, right? This is our neighborhood. You don't own it. [Door closes] Hey. Guess what? What's up? Well, my dad just called. He's gonna pay for the insemination. Says he was worried that he'd never be a grandpa. That's great. Yeah. So you know, back to plan "A". You know what? Fine. Saikensha wa saimusha yori kioku yoshi. "Creditors have better memories than debtors." Hey, Lieutenant, okay if we make a quick stop? Won't take long, I promise. Sure. Cruz, take a right here. This the right place? This is it. Aw, come on, Mouch. What is this? Just wait. I want you to see this. Yeah. Randy! How are you? What do you say, Larry? Good to see you, man. Hey. Chris. Hey, Larry, how you been? You're not getting away with a handshake. Come here, little brother. Yeah, good to see you. All right. Hey. Hey. Wow, you guys have grown. Yeah. How long has it been since you've been here? I don't remember. Is, uh, dad around? No, he's in Boston. He's supposed to be selling socks to filene's basement, but he's probably already in line for bleacher seats at Fenway. Randy called and said you were down about dad. So come on. There's something you should see. You should hear him talk about his son the firefighter. I can't get him to shut up about it. Okay. Mrs. Leppert. Chief. Hello. I'm sorry to bother you. No, no, no. We're all very sorry about your son. Thank you. You may know he was here once. And... he wanted to be a fireman ever since. Anyway, he would have been happy to know you guys were there at the end. And he would have wanted you to have this. Thank you for what you do in this neighborhood. Thank you. We owe this kid. We owe taye better than this. We are better than this. I have an idea. Ten-hut! Present arms!
