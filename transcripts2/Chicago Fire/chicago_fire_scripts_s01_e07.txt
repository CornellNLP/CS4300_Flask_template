 You're the one who got a problem with Detective Voight? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 How can I help you out? 
 Previously on  Chicago Fire... 
 His name is Casey. 
 How much? 
 You stop him for good, I'll give you two. 
 Move it in. 
 [Siren wails] 
 I got him. 
 You're cooked, youngblood. 
 It's gonna be all right. We're all right now. 
 It's over. 
 I get that surgery, the department doesn't like how it looks, I go on long-term disability. 
 At 75% pay. 
 And then do what, shay? 
 I fish off Navy pier for the next 20 years? 
 It's dumping gas! 
 Get a hose on there! 
 Go! 
 You're going in there? 
 You need to get back behind the lines. 
 Mouch, get this kid safe. 
 I'm not gonna pretend like I don't remember peeling you off the floor after that woman broke your heart. 
 I know. 
 I just always thought she was the one. 
 Come on! 
 Get down! 
 [Children cheering] 
 When can we go back inside? 
 We have to check with the gas company, ma'am. 
 And they'll tell you when it's safe. 
 Ms. Simpson, I was looking for Leonard to get the keys to the shed. 
 No one's seen him. 
 Oh, God. 
 Everyone, stop. 
 We're going back in. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 ♪ 
 Leonard! 
 Down here? 
 Call out! 
 You guys smell anything? 
 Are we sure they cut off the gas lines? 
 Oh, I shut it down myself. 
 [Bubbling] 
 Smells like chemicals. 
 Crystal meth! 
 Masks on! 
 Really, Leonard, with the kids up there? 
 Ah. 
 Okay, everyone, listen up. 
 Everyone on scene will have a baseline drug test. 
 Today. 
 Happy Thanksgiving. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Hey, chief, Dawson and I didn't go down there. 
 I don't care. 
 Anybody on the premises. 
 We're gonna want to know how much any of you may have in your system. 
 Okay. 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Hey. 
 How you doing? 
 Pretty good. 
 Seen you around a few times. 
 I live around the corner. 
 I like to watch. 
 Yeah. I remember you saying. 
 Well, you're welcome to come down to firehouse 51 anytime you'd like a tour. 
 Can I ride on the truck? 
 Maybe. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I may have taken something this morning. 
 Toradol? 
 Stronger. 
 What? 
 [Scoffs] Michael Jackson couldn't have handled those. 
 Where'd you get those? 
 Will it show up on the test? 
 Will these narcotics show up on a drug test? 
 Hey. 
 What? 
 Seriously, why don't we do this more often? 
 Okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Uh, lieutenant, you got some visitors. 
 They're early. 
 My sister has ruined more nooners for me than the rest of the world combined. 
 You had a lot of these growing up? 
 How do you think I put myself through med school? 
 [Laughs] 
 Come on, aunt Hallie. It starts in five minutes. 
 Uh-oh, what do we have here? 
 VIP guests for the parade? 
 Aunt Hallie! 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Viv. Hey. 
 How ya doing? 
 Can't complain. 
 Good? 
 How's, um--how's your mom? 
 Viv. 
 No, it's fine. She's, um-- she's doing all right. 
 Thanks for asking. 
 Now, who's gonna bring me back some candy? 
 I will! 
 Yeah! 
 Hey, tell your mom you get to eat as much as you can fit in your mouth. 
 [Laughs] 
 Right. 
 You guys have fun. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. See you when you get back. 
 Look at you. 
 Restaurant tricks. 
 Impressive. 
 [Marching band music] 
 25 members... 
 Look at these chumps. 
 Are you kidding, man? Parade detail is great. 
 Peter Mills, hold your arm up. 
 Now keep it there for five hours. 
 That's what being in the parade is. 
 Mills, the shriners-- they throw out candy-- you clean up, man. 
 Now, listen, I know you guys are gonna give me crap for this. 
 Go on. 
 [Sighs] 
 I want to start a podcast. 
 What the hell's that? 
 Well, when I record myself being equal parts charming and brilliant, and then I put it up on iTunes, and people subscribe, and they follow me. 
 A mute would be better at that than you. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Feigns laugh] 
 It's gonna be a "Day in the Life of a Chicago Firefighter" sort of thing. 
 We have a slow day, and you're just gonna reinforce the stereotype that all we do is sit around and eat. 
 You got a problem with it, lieutenant? 
 Go for it. 
 Drug tester's on his way. 
 And again, this is mandatory. 
 Hey, chief, there's a kid outside looking for you. 
 Thanks. 
 Good. 
 You came on by. 
 You said it was cool. 
 It is, it is. 
 What's your name? 
 Ernie. 
 Ernie? 
 Chief Boden. 
 You hungry, Ernie? 
 Hey, everybody. This here is Ernie. 
 He's gonna be eating some turkey with us. 
 What's up, Ernie? 
 Hey, Ernie. 
 Hey, I need a sous chef, chief. 
 Get over here, little man, we got a turkey dinner to prepare. 
 Go ahead. 
 Come on. 
 First thing we gotta do, taste this gravy. 
 Tell me what you think. 
 Good. 
 It's good. 
 Where'd you find that mutt? 
 I just want to see what's going on with him. 
 You catch a vibe? 
 I've seen him at two different fire scenes. 
 Chief, if we got a firebug here, you know it's next to impossible to prove anything. 
 Can you just spend some time with him? 
 See what we find out. 
 Yo, Ernie. 
 Don't let Mills here make you do all the work. 
 He's what we call a candidate. 
 You know how there's all those rungs on the ladder? 
 He's the bottom one. 
 Oh. 
 Come on, I'll give you a tour. 
 Hey, heads up. 
 Hey, what are you doing here on Thanksgiving? 
 Reinforcements. 
 [Alarm beeps, buzzes] 
 Truck 81, ambulance 61. 
 Multiple gunshot wounds. 1542 Elmwood Park. 
 Hey, would you put the turkey in? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 This meal is very important. 
 Kid, you should stay-- 
 Forget that. Come on. 
 Chief. 
 Yeah, I got him. 
 Ernie, stand here. 
 Let's go, let's go! 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Siren wails] 
 [Laughs] That was awesome. 
 Always is. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Horn honks] 
 Someone stepped on the anthill today. 
 [Groaning] 
 [Gunshots] 
 Get down! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Oh! 
 Ambulance 61, I need a 10-1 at Elmwood Park. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 They're still shooting here. 
 Copy that. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Where the hell's the cpd? 
 Help me, I'm bleeding! 
 [Groans] 
 [Shouting in Spanish] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Whistles] 
 Truck, ammo, move. 
 Get ready to move. 
 Crawl out the other side. 
 Cruz! 
 Yeah! 
 Move the truck forward, so we can use it as a barrier. 
 On it. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Let's go. Come on. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 ♪ 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Groaning] 
 Hey, man, you awake? 
 All right, turn him over. 
 Oh! 
 Ah, I got three holes, only two exit wounds. 
 Get him a backboard. 
 Yo. Yo! 
 There's another kid over there by that tree. 
 Two, three. 
 All right, you got this, shay? 
 Yeah. 
 [Siren approaching] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Shooters are in the window! 
 Police. You're surrounded. 
 They're heading north. Go, go! 
 Stop! Police! 
 Hey, you hurt, buddy? 
 Leon? 
 What the hell are you doing here, Leon? 
 You know this guy? 
 All right, this is a through by through. 
 You're gonna take this 4x4, you're gonna hold it-- 
 [winces] Ow. 
 Sorry. 
 Keep it from bleeding. 
 And then you're gonna wait for the next ambulance, okay? 
 I got it. Let it go. 
 [Groaning] 
 To hell with this. 
 Yo, you trippin', man. 
 [Grunts] 
 Cruz, what's going on? 
 Move! 
 [Grunts] 
 What are you doing? 
 Hey. Take it easy, yo. 
 Help him in. 
 Cruz. 
 He's my brother. 
 So you're trying to tell me that the cpd doesn't know how to handle a shift change. 
 That is unacceptable. 
 I had five fighters walking unprotected into a damn turf war. 
 Our turnout gear is not bulletproof. 
 Yeah, well, I suggest that you figure it out. 
 Uh-huh, yeah. 
 Yeah, I'll hold you to that. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Chief. 
 They're looking for you in the common room. 
 The bullet went through without hitting any bone. 
 He should be fine. 
 Can I talk to him? 
 No, I gave him something to sleep, but after that... 
 Wanna stay here? 
 No, man, I better not. 
 Doctor. 
 Be right there. 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 [Scoffs] Can you hand me a slice of bread? 
 Yeah. 
 Really? 
 [Groans] 
 It's supposed to keep your eyes from tearing up. 
 Doesn't look like it's working. 
 It never does. I don't know why I keep doing it. 
 All right, let me give it a shot. 
 You're gonna tear up. 
 I don't think so. 
 See? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Laughs] 
 I'm good. 
 All right, okay, let me try a piece. 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah, just point the way to chief Boden or whatnot. 
 I'm Boden. 
 Dan Jenkins. Ensurtech. 
 I understand you have a situation here. 
 Yeah, sorry to make you work Thanksgiving. 
 Yeah. It is what it is. 
 I just go where they tell me. 
 Well, I got a few bucks on the cowboys game, so let's get her done. 
 Do you want to set up in the-- 
 Who's first? 
 AIDS and HIV. 
 What we found today... 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You, uh-- you put the turkey in? 
 Of course. 
 And you tent the white meat with the foil? 
 I taught you to tent the white meat. 
 Okay. 
 You're in my spot. 
 Which one of you is Joe Cruz? 
 I am. 
 Fill 'er up. 
 Hey, uh, does it matter if I had a ton of pancakes this morning? 
 It matters if they were made of crack. 
 Peter Mills. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 [TV announcer continues in background] 
 Hey, chief said you live around here. 
 Over on Racine. 
 You got any brothers and sisters? 
 Lucky you. 
 All I got was my brother's crap after he put holes in it. 
 What about your folks? 
 What about 'em? 
 They around? 
 Yeah, look, my old man was in and out too, so I know. 
 Let's go get-- 
 Mine's in jail. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You get to see him at all? 
 Nah. 
 Grandma don't drive. 
 [Honking horn] Ugh! 
 Joining the parade would be faster. 
 Can you move? 
 Ooh, I can t-- 
 Both : Whoa! 
 Jeez, shay, relax. 
 Sorry. 
 We could toss these pork rinds to the kids. 
 [Honks] 
 Oh, check it out. 
 [Indistinct arguing] 
 Whose fault do you think it is? 
 [Arguing] 
 Woman's. It's always the woman's. 
 That's why I'm happily single. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 [Laughs] 
 [Honks] 
 Dude. 
 I know, it's a goat. 
 But it's our goat. 
 Oh, shay, you got a visitor. 
 Hey. 
 Look what the cat dragged in. 
 Cat brought pumpkin pie. 
 Hey, Clarice. 
 Mm. 
 I hope this isn't totally inconvenient. 
 No, no, no, of course not. 
 I just--I, uh-- 
 I wanted to say thank you, you know, today for that, I guess. 
 Oh, of course. 
 It was just so good to see you. 
 It was really good. I was, uh... I was blown away. 
 Gabriela Dawson. 
 Oh, checking for meth. 
 Mm, you know. 
 Can I get you some coffee or something? 
 Decaf. 
 Okay. Have a seat. 
 Schools plan to open at regular times after the holidays. 
 Hey, could I borrow you for a second? 
 Okay, and, uh, three, two, one. 
 And... 
 Recording. 
 Hi, I'm Brian Zvonecek, and we're picking up where I last left off. 
 Oh! Look who just walked in. 
 It's firefighter Randy McHolland, better known around firehouse 51 as Mouch. 
 Mouch, where'd the nickname come from? 
 Do I need to talk loud or just normal? 
 Just talk normal. 
 Normal. 
 Yeah. 
 Got it. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Okay. 
 And, uh, three, two, one, and... 
 Recording. 
 Mouch, how you doing today? 
 Do I need to push the button, or you just want me to-- 
 No, no, just, uh--you just-- just--just talk normal. 
 Okay? Just-- 
 Normal. 
 Be normal. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 And recording. 
 [Hits button] 
 How ya doin', Mouch? 
 Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. 
 Yes! 
 So tell us about the nickname. 
 Uh... 
 Okay, uh... 
 Oh--okay, it's-- it's--there's-- there's two halves to it, right? 
 So you got--you got over-- over here, you got half man, right? 
 And then, uh... 
 Over here, the other half would be, um, half, uh... 
 Couch, I guess? 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, cool. 
 Yeah, well, you tell mom to save me a piece of cobbler. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I love you too, Antonio. 
 Okay, you tell him happy turkey day for me. 
 Bye. 
 [TV announcer in background] 
 Clarice. 
 Gabriela. 
 Uh, I don't mean to butt into your business or anything, but... 
 [Sighs] 
 Leslie's in a really great place right now, and you're... 
 [Inhales] Pregnant. 
 It's Thanksgiving. 
 Why don't you go home and spend it with your husband? 
 I just came by to say thank you. 
 Yeah, and you did. 
 Is there some masking agent I could take? 
 To throw off a drug test? 
 Today? 
 Come on. 
 Look, I'm--I'm-- I'm looking for a way out here. 
 What about poppy seed muffins or something like that? 
 I heard that that can-- 
 Do you have 70 of them? 
 Because that's what it would take. 
 Look, I warned you. 
 Please leave my name out of this. 
 You Severide? 
 Fill 'er up. 
 [Kicks desk] 
 
 
 
 Leon. 
 Hey, you picked up. 
 How you feeling? 
 Terrible, yo. 
 They said they're keeping me overnight for a test or something. 
 Yeah, no, I'm sure that's only a precaution. 
 Hey, listen, I get off my shift at 8:00 A.M., so I'm gonna come pick you up. 
 Yo, if you're gonna be all up on me, I'll just take the bus. 
 Si, esta bien. 
 No B.S. No speeches. 
 I just wanna get you home. 
 Fine. 8:00 A.M. 
 Yeah, I'll see you then. 
 [Closes phone] 
 Oh! 
 Ooh. 
 Holy mackerel. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh. 
 No, I wouldn't do that if I were you. 
 Boden will kill you. 
 Whoa, whoa, you're not carving that thing, are you? 
 No. What, do you think I'm crazy? 
 Hey, where's Clarice? 
 Uh, she said she had to get home. 
 That's weird. 
 Yeah, well, she always was. 
 Cowboys, channel four. 
 Ah, now we're talking. 
 [Laughs] 
 Missing a sample, chief. 
 Who? 
 Kelly Severide. 
 Let's see what the holdup is. 
 You joining us? 
 If it's okay. 
 Ah, are ya kiddin' me? I'll set the table. Come on. 
 I'll call everybody to chow. 
 Whoo! 
 Hey. 
 What happened to your sister and the kids? 
 They ran into a bunch of families from their school and got a ride home. 
 That's too bad, I was gonna put 'em in the gear. 
 I know. That was sweet. 
 We'll do it next time. 
 Okay. 
 [Chuckles] 
 How was it? 
 It was great, actually. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know how she does it, but they're amazing kids. 
 Chow, chow. 
 Turkey time. 
 I'm--I'm meeting my parents at the club. 
 Stay for a bite. 
 You're staying for a bite. 
 Come on. 
 [Laughs] 
 How can you resist? 
 [Laughs] 
 Want you awake? 
 Both : [Laugh] 
 I put it down, and I don't know what I did with it. 
 We got food and football. Could be worse. 
 Right? 
 Okay, we got cranberries, gravy, that stuffing is the sh-- 
 Uh, sorry. 
 Ernie, that--that stuffing is really good. 
 Dig in. 
 This is the best-lookin' bird that we've had in years. 
 [Tapping knife] 
 Okay, what are we gonna name it? 
 Aw, jeesh. 
 Name it? 
 Yeah. 
 Always name the bird before you eat it. 
 Usually after an old girlfriend or boyfriend or something. 
 Ah, interesting. 
 That's funny. 
 How 'bout Leon? 
 You want to name the bird after your own brother? 
 After today? 
 Leon it is. 
 [Alarm beeps, buzzes] 
 Squad three, truck 81, engine 51, ambulance 61. 
 Here, Jenkins, I'll hit it when I get back. 
 Home residence, fire. 6542 cook street. 
 Gotta go, kid. 
 Let's go, let's go! 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Turkey fire, guaranteed. 
 Uh, what happened? 
 Uncle Brad is what happened. 
 I know how to deep-fry a doll-gum turkey, Sharon. 
 You put in too much grease. 
 You can't fry a beer can turkey. 
 Is everyone out of the house? 
 Duh. 
 Why aren't you putting out the frikkin' fire here? 
 Engine'll be here any moment. 
 Cruz, cancel. 
 All right, is anybody hurt? Is anybody burned? 
 You guys okay? 
 Okay. 
 Guess we're gonna go back and eat. 
 What? 
 I told him, "I you put a beer can in a bird's ass, it's gonna explode." 
 And I told you, you dumb bitch, if you bark at me-- 
 You son of a-- 
 Oh! 
 [Grunting] 
 I'll get-- 
 Kick his ass, T! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey! 
 Down! 
 Knock it off! 
 Oh, God. 
 My snowmobile. 
 Get back! 
 Get the back. 
 Window. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 [Grunting] 
 Door. 
 All right, let's wrap it up. 
 [Struggling] 
 Let me- 
 Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Beeping] 
 Hey, yo, Elise. 
 Turkey's in the fridge with the stuffing, and, um, the rolls are out, but they should be all right. 
 Thank you for your help. 
 You look just like that picture of pop, you know that? 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Both : Oh! 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, whoa, wait, let me heat it up. Give me ten minutes. 
 Yeah, we got a microwave, just-- 
 Mi--pssh. 
 Microwave? 
 Give me ten minutes. It'll be worth it. 
 [Game announcer in background] 
 [Sighs] 
 What's the score? 
 Nothing, nothing. 
 Where's Kelly Severide? 
 Let's gas up. 
 We got 3/4 of a tank. 
 Let's do it anyway. 
 That's right. 
 That's cool. 
 [Knocks] Hey, you wanted to see us, chief? 
 Yeah, Ernie here has been waiting to sit behind the wheel of an honest-to-God Chicago fire truck. 
 Do you think that you could arrange that? 
 Only if he doesn't try to take my job. 
 Hmm. 
 Come on, Ernie. 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, and, uh, give me back my helmet. 
 Enjoy. 
 [Sighs] 
 And? 
 Ah, his dad's in prison, and his mom is gone and probably an addict. 
 He hasn't seen her in years. 
 He lives with his grandma, and from what he says, she ain't all there. 
 Do you think he's an arsonist? 
 He needs an outlet. 
 He's looking for some control in his life. 
 Maybe that backpack's got something incendiary he tosses into a dumpster, and he gets a high watching us roll up. 
 It fits. 
 But am I sure? 
 Just be careful. 
 Of what? 
 Don't replace a kid you lost with a kid you can't save. 
 Hey. 
 So how was it? 
 Cool. Can I go for a ride? 
 Yeah, someday. 
 Answer me something, Ernie. 
 What do you carry around in that backpack there? 
 Stuff. 
 Stuff? 
 Can I see it? 
 Why? 
 Just curious is why. 
 It's mine. 
 I know it's yours. 
 I just want to see what you got carrying around. 
 No. 
 Why are you getting so upset? 
 Because you're making fun of me. 
 I'm not making fun of you, I promise. 
 Yes, you are! 
 Ernie, calm down. 
 I want to help you. 
 Get away from me. You don't know me. 
 Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 You don't know anything! 
 Calm down. 
 Bitch! 
 [Engine turns off] 
 [Exhales] 
 Uh, coming right up. 
 [Game announcer in background] 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, baby. 
 [Alarm beeps, buzzes] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Squad 3, truck 81, engine 51, ambulance 61. 
 Hey, sorry it took so long. 
 Sh [chuckles] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 We got at least ten cars at mile marker 54. 
 We're gonna need more of everything. 
 [Siren wails] 
 Over here. My husband-- please, you have to help him. 
 Gonna get that truck? 
 I got it, chief. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 It's my husband. His neck is bleeding. 
 What--what's his name? 
 Craig. 
 Hey, Craig. Can you hear me? 
 Are you hurt anywhere else besides your neck? 
 Okay, I need you to remove your hand so that we can take a look, okay? 
 Oh, arterial bleed. 
 Shay, can you give me some more 4x4s? 
 Just give me everything we got in the ambo. 
 [Coughing] 
 There we go. Okay, just head over to the median. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 My son is in the back! 
 Somebody, please! Help us! 
 [Groaning] 
 I got a pin-in over here! 
 Ma'am, you okay? 
 [Whimpering] 
 Cover up. 
 [Whimpers] 
 Carol. 
 Carol, are you okay? 
 [Screams] 
 Carol, oh, my God! 
 Sir, we're gonna get her out. 
 We'll get a paramedic here as soon as we can. 
 She's having a baby. 
 [Panting] 
 [Screams] Do something! 
 Okay, we need to move this car and get this door open! 
 [Panting]  
 [Screams] 
 Okay, now do it. 
 I'm trying. 
 All right, sir. Get out. 
 [Whimpering] 
 Dawson, shay? 
 Hey, we gotta get a tow truck in here to clear a path for the ambo. This one's gotta move now. 
 Stay here. 
 Yeah. 
 I need you guys up next to 81. 
 We're stuck here, Casey. Arterial bleed. 
 Mic's open. 
 Uh, I got a woman about to give birth on the highway. 
 Is the baby crowning? 
 Yeah, I can see the top of the head. 
 Oh, God, he's coming! I can feel him coming. 
 [Screams] 
 Okay, you're gonna have to do this, Casey. 
 [Gasping] 
 Continue breathing, honey. 
 Otis. 
 Oh, God, he's coming! 
 Hey! 
 Hey, hey! Clear this one first! 
 He's coming! 
 All right, Casey, tell me what you see. 
 Uh, I can see the head. 
 It keeps coming out and then going back. 
 Tell her to push. 
 You gotta push, Carol. 
 I am. 
 [Engine revs] 
 Ahh! 
 Here. 
 I'll swing the ambo around. 
 You can do it, Carol! 
 Push harder. 
 I am! 
 Okay. 
 One more big breath and a push. 
 Let's do this. 
 [Groaning] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Gasping] 
 Casey? 
 Dawson, he's not crying. I don't think he's breathing. 
 It's an obstructed airway. 
 You have to put your mouth over the baby's nose and mouth and breathe for it. 
 It's just like CPR. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, get your leg up if you can. 
 All right, sir, can you walk? I got you. 
 [Panting] 
 Casey. 
 Is he okay? Is he okay? 
 Casey. 
 [Baby crying] 
 Oh, my God. 
 All right, let's get him in. 
 [Baby crying] 
 [Firemen applauding] 
 [Baby crying] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 This is it. 
 All right. 
 Yeah. 
 Great shift, men. 
 Proud of all of you. 
 Leon, your time is here. 
 Hey, uh, chief, maybe another name? 
 Sure. 
 Call it "Jenkins, the piss guy." 
 [Laughter] 
 Jenkins it is. 
 [Laughs] 
 You'll be pleased to know that all your tests came through negative on meth or any other drug. 
 All right, yeah. 
 God bless us, everyone! 
 [Laughs] 
 Damn, Peter Mills. 
 You were not kidding about that stuffing. 
 Hey, chief, don't be stingy with the turkey! 
 Get outta here. 
 You know what your first delivery means, Casey? 
 Everyone buys you a round. 
 Sounds good. 
 Dig in! 
 Come on! 
 All right! 
 Give me some of that corn. 
 Yeah, I gotta get some of that stuffing. 
 This looks incredible. 
 [All chattering] 
 Don't eat all that! 
 Oh! 
 [Laughter] 
 Happy Thanksgiving! 
 Hear, hear! 
 [All cheering] 
 [Sighs] 
 A lot of people out there are probably wondering why we do this job. 
 Um, and it's true. 
 Some days are bad. 
 What were you gonna do? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know who this is, Kelly, but it isn't you. 
 Do you want a ride or not? 
 You know what? Happy Thanksgiving. 
 We grope around in zero visibility, hoping we grab onto an arm or a leg, and we pull someone to safety. 
 And I-I-I gave him my breath, and--and he-- he opened his eyes, and he started crying, and... 
 [Sighs] 
 I mean, the little guy was alive. 
 I was a part of that. 
 [Exhales] 
 I want us to have a baby. 
 I know. 
 No, I-- 
 Soon. Now. 
 I don't know if I'm ever gonna want kids. 
 I want them because you want them. 
 But if I'm being honest, I just-- 
 Sometimes you can search through an entire room, come up empty. 
 And you hear about the kid you missed under the bed. 
 I'm supposed to pick up a Leon Cruz. 
 Checked himself out an hour ago. 
 Left with three guys. 
 I don't care who you are. 
 I don't care how many years you've had on the job. 
 You think to yourself, "How did I miss it? 
 How come I didn't reach just a few feet further?" 
 I can't do it. 
 I don't love him. 
 I mean, I can't have a child growing up like that. 
 Come here. 
 No doubt, there are days you want to pick up your helmet, and you wanna Chuck it in the lake. 
 Hey, Shonda. 
 Yeah, I know I didn't call Thanksgiving. 
 I'm... calling now, so-- 
 Shonda, please. 
 Put Jimmy on the phone. 
 Some days, you get to see things that no one gets to see... 
 You guys, dad's here. 
 Daddy! 
 Daddy! 
 Go say hi. 
 Hey, what is this? 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey. Ah. 
 We thought we would celebrate day-after Thanksgiving, since you were on shift. 
 That's, uh... 
 Thanks, guys. 
 A wife grateful you dragged her husband to safety, a grown man dripping like a faucet 'cause you saved his son. 
 And every once in a while, you get to see a baby take its first breath in the middle of a ten-car pileup with lights and sirens and a whole group of firemen standing around just clapping till it hurts. 
 Those are good days. 
 Two shots of whiskey, please. 
 Oh, well, well. The guest of honor. 
 I heard you were buying. 
 Ya heard right. 
 Thank you. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thanks. 
 [Glasses clink] 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm good. 
 You want to know what I'm thankful for? 
 I'm thankful because I have two families. 
 And not too many people can say that.
