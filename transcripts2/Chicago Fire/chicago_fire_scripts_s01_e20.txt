 Present arms! 
 Previously on Chicago Fire... 
 [Gunfire, tires screeching] 
 Could this be Voight related? 
 Voight? 
 When it comes to gang violence the man has a long reach. 
 I'm gonna push to fast track Peter Mills to Squad. 
 Sounds like you guys have all the answers. 
 This is Tara Little. She's a candidate. 
 She's gonna be riding along with you guys for the next few shifts. 
 Who asked who out? I'm just curious. 
 Wait, you did, right? 
 What? 
 Yeah, you asked me to dinner that one night. 
 Oh, no, that... that wasn't a date. 
 Come on! 
 Kelly, I want to know if you'd like to have a baby with me. 
 I'm in.  
 You don't have enough sack to admit you're sleeping with Heather. 
 I'm done explaining myself. 
 You haven't explained a damn thing. 
 'Cause you're wrong! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So, we're off and running. 
 For what? 
 I went to the doctor's office this morning and got my hormone shot. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 How you feeling? 
 Fine. 
 Yeah, it's not affecting me at all. 
 Just, uh, it means the window for ovulation is gonna be in the next couple of days so don't make any plans. 
 And, um, as soon as these say that I'm good to go, we gotta get to the clinic and perform our respective duties. 
 Uh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. 
 Well... [Clears throat] 
 Sorry, I'm just... I'm really excited. 
 I can see that. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Hey. 
 I am too. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Both laugh] 
 Oh! 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Pecan caramel popcorn. 
 Let's get into this before Herrmann finds out. 
 Herrmann's gone hunting with his brother. 
 It's all the pecan caramel popcorn you can eat. 
 Sweet! 
 Who brought this in? 
 A paramedic candidate who's riding with Dawson and Shay. 
 Oh, yeah, Tara. 
 Apparently she spent a couple of shifts over at 95. 
 Bob Macelroy said she's pretty cool. 
 What, are you stalking her now? 
 No, I'm not stalking her. 
 I just like to know who I'm working with. 
 Are you wearing cologne? 
 No. 
 Body spray, maybe. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, Tara. 
 Okay. Hey. 
 Uh, Severide, I think Capp's looking for you. 
 No, I just left him. 
 Hi, everybody. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Did you bring this popcorn because it's amazing. 
 I am not above buying people's affection. 
 So, um, I hear that you are quite a graphic designer. 
 So is anyone with a laptop. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah, I wish I'd figured that out before I racked up $60,000 in student loans. 
 Well, what made you wanna be an E.M.T.? 
 Uh, my roommate's a paramedic at 35. 
 I didn't have to hang out with her very long before I realized the firehouse is where it's at. 
 [Alarm rings] 
 Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61. 
 Here we go. 
 Industrial accident, Racine and 15th Street. 
 [Siren blares] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Hey, what happened? 
 A worker backed a forklift into the shelves and the whole thing came down on top of him. 
 Don't move the pallet. He's there. 
 Give me a hand with this. 
 Hey, watch your back. 
 Hang in there, buddy. 
 We're gonna get you out. 
 [Labored breathing] 
 Coming to you. 
 Hey, can you tell me your name? 
 Phil. 
 Phil Manfreddi. 
 Okay, hi, Phil. 
 Wait and see, wait and see. 
 Okay, Phil, I want you to breathe slow and easy for me, okay? 
 You see his nail beds, how blue they are? 
 What's that mean? 
 Shock. He's in shock. 
 Very good. We're gonna keep his C-spine nice and straight. 
 And we need to warm him up. 
 Okay, I'm gonna lift your head, hon. 
 Let's get the spreaders. 
 Forget the spreaders. 
 Get the torch in here. 
 We need to cut this beam. 
 Copy that. 
 Wait, why... why don't we try and lift it? 
 It's too unstable. 
 Anything shifts, and it'll all fall right back on top of him. 
 Sir! Is there anything flammable in these boxes? 
 No, sir. 
 Need water over here. 
 Here we go. 
 Severide, kill the torch! 
 What? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look out! 
 Everybody, get down! 
 Unh! 
 Ugh! 
 Is it out? 
 Can't tell. I need to get in there. 
 [Overlapping shouts] 
 It's still smoldering. 
 This can go up again any second. 
 We gotta move him. 
 I didn't make it through the beam. 
 Wait. 
 Wait. How about this? 
 [Panting] 
 It's worth a try. 
 Hadley. 
 Yeah. 
 [Grunting] 
 [Metal creaks] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Sharp inhalation] 
 Focus on his face and keep him calm. 
 All right. 
 You're gonna be okay, Phil. 
 Quick thinking, candidate. 
 Gear's all picked up, Lieutenant. 
 All right. Let's get back home. 
 Where's Mills? 
 Leave his ass. 
 You got it. 
 So then, what's the difference between an oxy/acetylene torch and an exothermic torch? 
 For starters, an exothermic will cut through a solid block of concrete. 
 Cool. 
 Yeah. 
 Here, let me show you what else we use. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Laughs] 
 They'll get over it. 
 [Backup alert beeping] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Your Lieutenant says the bathroom needs a good cleaning, candidate. 
 Hey. 
 Kelly, right? 
 Yeah. 
 We have a mutual friend. 
 Jennifer Robinson? 
 She tends bar at Cubby Bear. 
 Oh. 
 She said to say hello. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, tell her I said hello. 
 Will do. 
 It's nice to have a connection to someone here. 
 Yeah, it's a... it's a great group at 51. 
 I'm sure that you'll fit right in. 
 Shay and Dawson taking good care of you? 
 Yeah. 
 I actually have some copies to go make for Dawson right now. 
 So I'll see you later. 
 Sure. 
 Hey, Otis. 
 Check this out. 
 My grandparents in Madrid. 
 My grandfather proposed to her there. 
 Hmm, you will never see Russian grandparents smiling like that. 
 [Laughs] 
 The place they're standing in front of is one of the oldest restaurants in Europe. 
 You been? 
 No. Someday. 
 I think Molly's needs a big, wooden door like this. 
 Something timeless and beautiful. 
 How did I know there was an agenda attached to this story? 
 It is a nice door. 
 Look, Dawson, now is not the time to be making design decisions, okay? 
 Herrmann's unreachable in the woods of Ontario somewhere. 
 Yeah, exactly why now is the time. 
 Well, we don't have any money left. 
 There's a salvage place I use. 
 There's all kinds of old structural pieces. 
 Might take some searching, but we could take a look. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 That sounds great. 
 Bathrooms are done, Lieutenant. 
 Showers need a good cleaning, too. 
 Okay... uh, can I talk with you for a minute first in private? 
 Sure. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I wanted to apologize for this morning. 
 I knew I screwed up and it won't happen again. 
 But I also wanna formally let you know that I will be pursuing that open opportunity in Squad. 
 I heard. 
 But right now, you are on Truck. 
 And while you're here, you better act like it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Alarm rings] 
 Ambulance 61, laceration injury. 
 670 North Talman Avenue. 
 [Siren blares] 
 So sorry about this. 
 My husband, Dennis, he was working on the garage door and it just started opening. 
 [Groaning] 
 The arm's caught in there. We're not equipped for this. 
 Call in in. 
 Dispatch, this is Ambulance 61. 
 We need a truck company to 670 North Talman Avenue. 
 My shoulder! I heard the muscle make a ripping sound. 
 [Grunting] 
 Okay... we're gonna get you down, Dennis. 
 Let me support your weight, okay? 
 Tara, take hold of his legs with me. 
 We're gonna lift him up. 
 Tara! 
 I need your help. 
 All right, come here. 
 Okay, it's okay. 
 Ugh. 
 Dawson, see if you can lift the door. 
 [Groans] 
 God. 
 Tara, get up here and help me. 
 Lift this one. 
 Dennis... 
 [Grunting] 
 This is gonna hurt like hell, but it's gonna be quick, all right? 
 Tell me, what are you gonna do? 
 [Screams] 
 Okay, all right. Right there. 
 [Panting] 
 Arlene, my arm! 
 Sweetie, you're all right. 
 All right, come on. You can come with us. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where'd Tara go? 
 She off crying in a corner somewhere? 
 Oh, come on, that was pretty gnarly. 
 Cut her some slack. 
 So you and Casey going treasure hunting after shift, huh? 
 Don't even start that. 
 I gotta say though, it's just nice to be back to normal with him. 
 "Normal?" 
 "Normal" as in buried romantic feelings and unspoken sexual tension? 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, I ran into Mike, and he said Hallie, she's... she's long gone. She's history. 
 She's off finding herself, doing some medical aid work in South America or somewhere... 
 I don't care, Shay. 
 I got my man, all right? 
 Hey, hey! 
 Excuse me, don't touch that! 
 That's not yours! 
 Put it back. 
 How long ago since that hormone shot? 
 Just don't mess with my gurney. 
 Grabbed a couple coffees for you guys. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 I, uh, I saw the doctor in the hall. 
 She said you saved that man's arm. 
 Well, we got him here fast. 
 That's the key. 
 A quick response is everything. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mills. 
 Yeah, Lieutenant? 
 Come here. 
 Have a seat. 
 This is a pretty good article on the different types of cutting torches and what situations they're best for. 
 Oh, cool. 
 Thanks, Lieutenant. 
 How are the classes going? 
 Good. 
 They're really good, actually. 
 I couldn't get into the vertical rescue this time around so... 
 It's full up.  
 What are you doing? You can't stop it. 
 Where's the defense in this game? 
 There's no defense in paper football. 
 I get a penalty kick. Put up your uprights. 
 Aw! [Laughs] 
 Can someone please explain to me why our truck candidate is sitting at the Squad table? 
 Does Severide know? 
 Severide's there. 
 They're all there. 
 It's a little tea party, and Peter Mills is the guest of honor. 
 Call Lieutenant Brunson. 
 Tell him I want you in his class. 
 Great. I will. 
 Good. 
 I guess we're not good enough for him anymore. 
 What a slap in the face. 
 Mills could use a lecture on company loyalty. 
 I've been here, what, five years? 
 Nobody ever talked about grooming me for Rescue Squad, but Mills, oh, Mills... 
 Maybe that's because he's busting his ass. 
 Bet you a dollar you miss that. 
 Make it a beer. 
 You're on. 
 [Laughs] 
 Gee, I guess I owe you a beer. 
 Chief, got a sec? 
 Yeah. 
 This business about getting Mills on Squad, you sure he's ready? 
 Severide thinks so. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sure he does. 
 Have you talked to Mills about it? 
 Yeah, I have. 
 A real conversation? 
 Or just long enough for him to say what you wanted to hear? 
 Look, Casey, I get it. 
 You are tired of sniffing out talent and training them up, only to have them poached by Squad. 
 This isn't about me, Chief. 
 It shouldn't be about you, either. 
 Or your feelings of obligation toward Henry Mills. 
 Your concerns... are duly noted. 
 Yeah, no, I know I missed a couple sessions, but Lieutenant Severide, he really wants me to take this class. 
 So I'm hoping that there's still time to jump in. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, that's great. 
 Great, I'll wait to hear from you. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, what are you doing here? 
 Um, taking care of some business. 
 Okay. 
 I feel like I'm doing something wrong. 
 I... I see the way that people look at me, and I can just imagine what they're saying behind my back. 
 Ambition makes people uncomfortable. 
 You just have to remind yourself that you're not doing it for them. 
 Yeah, well, I think it's something a little deeper though with Casey, isn't it? 
 What do you mean? 
 You think he'd be riding me this hard if I wasn't with the girl that he likes? 
 [Laughs] You... you don't know what you're talking about, Pete. 
 You messed up. 
 Casey rapped your knuckles for it. 
 You know how many times Otis had to mop this house top to bottom when he was a candidate? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [Footsteps] 
 Cindy. 
 Hi, Leslie. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Fat. 
 [Laughs] 
 Uh, Christopher left his set of car keys here. 
 I just need to grab them. 
 Okay. 
 Did he, uh, call you yet to brag about how many innocent birds he's killed? 
 No, they're... they're deep in the woods up there, so I don't expect to hear from him. 
 Mm, well, I'm sure we'll all get an earful once he's back. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You okay? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah, I just got real winded walking in here. 
 That's what I get for gaining 25 pounds in the first two trimesters. 
 When did the, uh, shortness of breath start? 
 Oh, I guess it got tricky about an hour ago. 
 I... I should sit... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 A few minutes, maybe. 
 Yep. 
 All right, well, just to be safe, I'm gonna just go ahead and take your vitals, okay? 
 Oh, it's probably nothing. 
 Yeah. 
 Everything look okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, everything's all right. 
 I just wanna get you to Lakeshore and have a few things checked out, okay? 
 Okay. 
 So just stay here. 
 Take nice, easy breaths and, um, I'm gonna go tell Chief Boden, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Chief. 
 Cindy's oxygen levels are way too low. 
 It could be a P.E. We need to get her to Lakeshore now. 
 Go. Go! 
 [Siren blaring] 
 All right, Cindy, nice, easy breaths. 
 In and out, you just relax. 
 Dawson, she's lost consciousness. 
 Call ahead to Lakeshore, give 'em the report. 
 I gotta tube her. 
 You need my help? 
 No, just get us there fast as possible. 
 Give me the intubation kit. 
 Lakeshore, this is... 
 Tara! 
 Be advised we are on route with a pregnant female... 
 Hurry up. 
 Thank you. 
 Hand me the 7 1/2. 
 Ambu bag. 
 Come on, Cindy. 
 38 year-old female. 26 weeks gestation. 
 She went unresponsive, stopped breathing,  and I had to intubate. 
 She's a friend, the wife of one of our guys. 
 Sounds like a P.E. 
 Let's push T.P.A. and tell the C.T. scanner we're coming. 
 Right away. 
 We've got her. 
 She shouldn't be here alone. 
 You should go with her. 
 You sure? 
 100%. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, how is she? 
 The clot traveled to her lungs. 
 We did a thrombectomy and fished it out. 
 And how's the baby? 
 The baby's fine. 
 We're starting her on blood thinners so she'll be on bed rest for the remainder of the pregnancy. 
 But other than that, she's fine. 
 Okay. 
 You can go in and see her. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, girl. 
 Get over here. 
 I'm so glad you're okay. 
 Thank you, Leslie. 
 Of course. 
 
 
 
 [Knocks] 
 You and Mouch get a hold of Herrmann? 
 Yeah, uh, park rangers tracked him down. 
 He's on his way home now. 
 Great news about Cindy. 
 Thanks to Shay. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Uh-oh. 
 What'd I do now? 
 Good morning, Dawson. 
 Hey, Chief Hatcher. 
 I came by to see how Tara Little's doing on the rig. 
 Uh... yeah, she's a nice girl. 
 Putting in a real effort. 
 Dawson, one thing I know I can rely on with you is a straight story. 
 And that's what I'm looking for here now. 
 She's not cut out for a busy house, Chief. 
 She's game, has a positive attitude, but she doesn't have the stomach for it. 
 Sound like city work's not for her. 
 Maybe the suburbs. 
 Thanks, Dawson. 
 No problem. 
 Been nice... not seeing any violations with your name lately. 
 Keep it up. 
 I love how solid all this old construction stuff is. 
 Houses were built to last. [Grunts] 
 Cool, let me check it out. 
 It's pretty heavy. 
 I'm sorry, are you saying I can't manage? 
 Mm, look at that game face. 
 Give it to me. 
 All right. 
 I got it. 
 It's fine. 
 It's not that bad. 
 Yeah, you look like you got it. 
 Okay. No, it's... take it. 
 Yeah? Sure? 
 Take it. Ta... take it. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Doors. 
 Oh, Casey. 
 Ooh. 
 This is it. 
 Yeah, we can strip it down, stain it a dark mahogany or something. 
 Yeah. It's perfect. 
 If my mom sees this hanging up at Molly's, she is gonna go nuts. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Let me get this. 
 Hey. 
 Hey there. 
 Uh, look, I'm gonna have to blow off dinner tonight. 
 Yeah, they're letting me jump into this vertical rescue class, and I just can't. 
 Oh, yeah, no worries. 
 Um, we can... we can do it tomorrow night. 
 Okay. 
 Where you at? 
 Um, I'm looking at doors for the bar. 
 By yourself? 
 You wanna wait until tomorrow? 
 I can help you. 
 Um, no, I'm good. Thanks. 
 Talk to you later. 
 Okay. 
 [Knock on door] 
 I always hold up my end of the bet. 
 Ah, very honorable of you. 
 Am I interrupting something? 
 Uh, not really. Um... 
 Come on in. 
 [Laughs] Okay. 
 It was kind of a rough time when I started my E.M.T. certification. 
 My family thought I was crazy shifting gears from design. 
 Do they support you now? 
 Not really. 
 But they will as soon as I show them I can hack it. 
 I could tell that you didn't really remember Jennifer. 
 That bartender I asked you about. 
 No, I do, the... the blonde. 
 Black hair. Black. 
 Oh. 
 Nice try. 
 [Laughs] 
 She remembered you. 
 When I told her I was gonna be working at 51, she warned me about you. 
 She said that you were just my type. 
 That I'd have a hard time staying away. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 She's a smart girl, that Jen. 
 What the hell, Kelly? 
 What's wrong? 
 What's wrong? I called you, like ten times! 
 I... I must have left my phone at the gym. 
 I told you to be on alert. 
 I'm in the window. 
 I... 
 Now the clinic's closed! 
 Unbelievable. 
 Unbelievable! 
 Hey, I'm so... look, hey! 
 Listen, Shay, I'm sorry, okay? 
 We can go to the clinic tomorrow morning. 
 That's still in the window, isn't it? 
 No! There's no way to be sure about that. 
 I gotta ask, is this... is this you talking or is this the... 
 Don't blame this on the hormones! 
 You can't even bother to look at your phone? 
 You can't even think to look at it? 
 I didn't have it. 
 A baby isn't an afterthought, Kelly. 
 I know that. 
 Do you? 
 So I release you of the obligation. 
 Okay, save some for the lady. 
 Why? 
 She tanked Tara. 
 You tank the single attractive E.M.T. 
 I didn't tank her... 
 Yeah. 
 Otis. 
 I just said that she wasn't cut out for the streets of Chicago, okay? 
 They'll probably move her to Mayberry or something. 
 Wrong. 
 He probationary status was revoked, Dawson. 
 Hey, did you show Otis? 
 Uh... no, not yet. 
 Show me what? 
 The new door for the bar. 
 Oh, Dawson, I was happy with the one we had. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I know the guy who runs the place. 
 Dawson has expensive tastes, granted, but I managed to talk him down. 
 [Alarm rings] 
 Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3. Ambulance 61. 
 House fire, 4800 block, West Thomas. 
 Oh, look, guys. 
 Mills is gonna ride with us. 
 [Siren blaring] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 Severide, get that gate down. 
 Hadley, grab the k12. 
 Got it. 
 Windows are all covered up, Chief. 
 Can't get a look inside. 
 [Whirring] 
 Not seeing a lot of signs of occupancy here. 
 [Grinding] 
 Smell a little skunky to you? 
 Yep. 
 Patched into the city service just below the weather head. 
 They're stealing electricity. 
 Looks like we got a marijuana grow house, Chief. 
 Give me a small primary search team. 
 And be careful in there. 
 Power's disconnected. 
 Bring Mills in. 
 Teach him how to breach a grow house. 
 Mind if I run my own company? 
 All right, Mills, pay attention. 
 Wow. 
 Watch out for booby traps. 
 Don't get tangled up in wires or duct work, and keep an eye out for chemicals or fuel. 
 Copy that, Lieutenant. 
 Fire department, call out! 
 Anybody here? 
 Capp, pick him up. 
 You got it! 
 Pass him to me. 
 All right. 
 [Grunts] 
 Watch the glass. Unh. 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 What was that? Sounded like electricity. 
 Get him on the gurney. 
 Okay, we got him. 
 Where's Capp? 
 He was right behind me. 
 [Alarm whistling] 
 Capp! 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey! 
 Chief! 
 Take it easy. 
 We have already got two men inside. 
 [Alarm whistling] 
 Casey, you got eyes on Capp? 
 Not yet. 
 Capp, call out! 
 Capp, where are you? 
 Chief, the electricity is still on. 
 Come on. 
 We're looking for a secondary line now. 
 Hang on. 
 There. Right there. 
 Yeah. 
 [Alarm whistling] 
 Capp, call out! 
 Capp? 
 Talk to me, Casey. 
 He's caught up in some wires. 
 I can't tell if they're energized. 
 Don't touch him! 
 Stay back. 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 Casey, the secondary line is cut. 
 We're still looking for other lines. 
 Can't wait. 
 Stand back, Mills. 
 Hey, Casey, do you hear me? 
 Get in there! Help him! 
 Can't tell if he's breathing. 
 Hey. 
 How you feeling, Capp? 
 Smells like a phish concert out here. 
 [All laugh] 
 We'll take him in to get checked out. 
 Okay. 
 Come on. 
 Here we go. 
 Here we go. 
 Come on, bud. 
 I got him. I got him. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Rescuing Rescue Squad. 
 Nicely done, Mills. 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 Not gonna miss your ride this time, huh? 
 [Door slams] 
 Lieutenant... how come you never went for Squad? 
 Mills... all the lives we save, the people we help... you think they give a damn which company insignia we wear? 
 Truck 81, are you available to assist in a shooting incident? 
 Truck 81 responding. [Pounds door] 
 We gotta go. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 No rush, ladies. He's not going anywhere. 
 Territorial dispute. 
 Couple of corner boys ran up and shot him. 
 Same old story. 
 How do I know this guy? 
 Curtis. 
 This is the guy who helped Antonio bust Voight. 
 [Siren] 
 Hey, we're too late. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 How's Capp? 
 He's good, he's good. 
 No electrical burns or anything. 
 They gave him an E.K.G. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 [Drill whirs] 
 So what does this mean? 
 According to Boden, the D.A.'s office remains committed to its case against Detective Voight. 
 And, after all, Curtis's testimony wasn't the only arrow in their quiver. 
 Is that what you're hearing, Casey? 
 I thought we were here to celebrate. 
 Exactly. Come on, guys! 
 It's time for the inaugural round of beers at Molly's. 
 Hey, Casey. 
 Hey, Shay. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, how's Cindy doing? 
 She's good. 
 Herrmann's back, glued to her side, which is driving her crazy. 
 All right, guys. Belly up. Come on. 
 Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
 [All cheer] 
 To Molly's. 
 All : To Molly's. 
 [Glasses clink] 
 Ah, it's delicious, Otis. 
 But are you gonna chill it before opening? 
 God, I swear I plugged that in. 
 Okay, who wants to see this door? 
 Me. 
 Hey, can I talk to you? 
 Yeah, ab... 
 About the... listen... 
 Look, I'm so sorry. 
 About the other day, I messed up big time. 
 I know that. 
 It... 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Scoffs] I'm sorry. 
 I mean, it was the hormones. 
 Or... I think. 
 I'm not sure, but look, I... 
 I think I should make other arrangements, 'cause it's, like, our friendship is one of the only really good things I have going on in my life, and I don't wanna mess that up. 
 That's the silliest thing I've ever heard. 
 But, Kelly... 
 You're trying to give me an easy out, I get it. I do. 
 But I don't need one, okay? 
 We're doing this. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Come here. 
 I have to admit, it... looks pretty damn good. 
 Right? 
 And, hey, can you... I need a picture. 
 Okay. 
 Come here. 
 All right. 
 I hope this comes out okay. 
 I don't have my glasses. 
 Just give me this. 
 All right, guys. 
 [Door unlatches] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Whoa. Whoa. Sorry. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 We're trying to take this picture. 
 All right, sorry. 
 Looks great. 
 Hey, guys. 
 [Giggles] 
 Yeah. 
 Ready? [Camera clicks] 
 All right, one more. 
 [Camera clicks] Hey, Pete. 
 Hi, I thought you had classes all day. 
 Oh, I do. 
 Just wanted to carve out a couple of minutes to come see this door. 
 Looks great. 
 [Phone buzzing] 
 Uh, I gotta go to the firehouse. 
 What for? 
 I don't know. 
 See you guys. See ya. 
 Later, man. 
 Hey, Tara. 
 Okay. 
 Chief. 
 Come on in, Kelly. Take a seat. 
 Lieutenant Severide. 
 A subordinate has accused you of luring her to your apartment... and trying to force yourself upon her. 
 What? 
 She hasn't pressed criminal charges as yet and we are trying to convince her to keep this an internal matter. 
 Are you... are you... are you talking about Tara Little? 
 What did she say I did? 
 You're gonna wanna talk to your union rep. 
 See about getting a lawyer. 
 I really appreciate this, Casey. 
 It means a lot. 
 I know. 
 That's why I did it. 
 It seems like things are going pretty well with you and Mills. 
 Yeah. 
 They are. 
 He's a lucky guy. 
 [Door opens] 
 Uh, sorry, we're closed. 
 Hallie? 
 Hey, Matt. 
 What? 
 Hey. [Giggles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Wait, do you... 
 I thought you were in South America. 
 I was. I just got back. 
 The guys at the station said you might be here. 
 Hey, Gabi. How are you? 
 I'm good. I'm good. 
 You look... you look great. 
 Thanks. 
 Uh... 
 You wanna grab a coffee or something? 
 I'd love that. 
 All right.
