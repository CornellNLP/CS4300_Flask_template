 Dawson, track marks. 
 Previously on Chicago Fire...  
 Last few weeks have seen a spike in fatal overdoses. 
 We are now approaching each overdose as a potential homicide. 
 [Baby fussing] 
 Clarice Carthage and Leslie Shay? 
 Yes. 
 You've been served. 
 What is it? 
 Petition for full custody. 
 You two know each other? 
 I was engaged to Eric's sister. 
 The number you have reached is no longer in service. 
 You were a coward then, and you're a coward now. 
 Before this goes any further south, why don't you walk away? 
 You're to be in this house from 9:00 P.M. to 9:00 A.M. every day. 
 You are not to associate with any known criminals. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'll be back before my curfew. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I'm worried, mom...  
 I am not going out to sell crack! 
 I've never seen you like this before. 
 There's this new crew out of New York. 
 Those who don't pay, their girls are getting hit with bad dope. 
 That's who I'm trying to bring down. 
 [Tires screech, gunshots] 
 Antonio! 
 Somebody help! 
 Try not to move. 
 You're gonna be all right. 
 You're gonna be fine. [Honk honk] 
 Hey! Hey! Stop! 
 Stop! [Tires screech] 
 Gunshot wounds to the abdomen and left chest. 
 Exit under the arm caught the axillary artery. 
 I'll take over on pressure. 
 He's my brother. 
 I'm going into the O.R. with you. 
 Can't do it. Now. 
 Got it. Somebody grab the monitor. 
 Let's get him down the hall into four. 
 Go, go, go! 
 He's all cleaned up, daddy. 
 Oh, no, I'm not the... I'm not the... I'm... 
 Okay. 
 Hey, guy. Hey, buds. 
 Daddy. 
 Hey, bud. 
 [Electronic chime] 
 [Vibrating] 
 Dawson. 
 What happened? 
 Oh, baby. 
 [Crying] I don't know. 
 I'm not happy about our fight last night. 
 It's important to me that we communicate. 
 I agree. 
 I get the sense you weren't too happy about me going out with my friend Gary last night. 
 It had nothing to do with... Gary. 
 I was worried about my mother violating her parole. 
 Fine. Agreed. 
 Can we... agree to trust each other? 
 To discuss things like two adults? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm happy to hear it. 
 Eat while they're still warm. 
 You know something? 
 You're right. 
 If we're gonna live together, we need to get things out in the open. 
 So I'm gonna ask. 
 Why'd you do it? 
 Now you're just being hurtful. 
 No, I'm asking a question I need the answer to. 
 In 15 years, you've never told me why. 
 What made you go over to dad's? 
 You always do this! 
 He was really cagey. 
 We were talking right before it happened. 
 Listen, he's... he's lucky that you were there. 
 Okay? 
 Pete, it's fine. She knows. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Is he out of ICU? 
 No, not yet. 
 I'm gonna go to the hospital after shift. 
 All right. I'll go with you. 
 Hey. 
 I just heard. 
 How is he? 
 Uh, he lost a lot of blood, so they're still doing transfusions. 
 [Sighs] I'm so sorry. 
 Your brother went so above and beyond for me with the Voight thing. 
 If there's anything I can do, just let me know. 
 Thank you. 
 Uh, Chief wanted me to tell you there's a police detective here to see you in his office for some follow-up questions. 
 Okay. 
 Dawson, come on in. 
 This is Detective Dan Vikan from Narcotics. 
 Very sorry to hear about Antonio. 
 We got damn near every cop in this city out looking for who shot him. 
 Good to know. 
 Antonio was looking for the leader of the crew that's been putting out the bad drugs. 
 He talk to you about that? 
 'Cause I know you had a conversation with him right before he was shot. 
 He said that guys from Narcotics were being territorial and didn't want a guy from Vice taking his collars, so he was doing twice the work. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Let's have an honest conversation. 
 Let's. 
 Your brother went way off the reservation on this one. 
 You told me you were here to investigate the shooter, not investigate Antonio. 
 It's all related, Chief, and unfortunately, the first step is to try to sift through eight layers of lies he told his superiors and colleagues, myself included. 
 I'd trust my brother with my life. 
 I don't know you from a load of wood. 
 Your boss has my card if you decide to change your mind and help. 
 I honestly don't know anything about what's going on with Antonio. 
 Okay. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 You still work on boats? 
 Yeah. 
 Boater's key. Thanks. 
 You probably already got one, right? 
 Always use another. 
 I was out of line last shift. 
 So, uh, that is half a peace offering. 
 Accepted. The other half? 
 A bribe. 
 [Chuckles] 
 These things cost 7 bucks, man. 
 Fair enough. 
 Look. 
 Now that I know what really happened between you and Renee, I'm thinking she's probably been letting the guilt beat her up this whole time. 
 I got no right to ask this, but I think if you reached out to her, it could go a long way towards turning things around. 
 'Cause like I said, man, we don't hear from her. 
 Look, this is her cell number. 
 At least I think it is. It's a computerized voice. 
 I've left messages...  
 Eric, I don't even really know what I would say. 
 So maybe it's just best to leave the past in the past. 
 Maybe even just hearing your voice might make a difference. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, chow's up. 
 [Dog whines] 
 Hey, hey, don't you even think about it. 
 [Dog whimpers] 
 Shay, this is that baby book I was telling you about. 
 Lots of good stuff, swaddling, soothing. 
 Thanks, Herrmann. 
 Hey, do you know if it says anything about sleep schedules? 
 I didn't read it. 
 Hmm. 
 All right, you're our guy for construction on the new bar, right? 
 I believe the offer was free consultation. 
 Okay. All right. Fine. 
 Yeah. 
 The inspection is tomorrow, and then our new silent partner is coming over here later for a meet and greet. 
 We just gotta make sure that this guy knows that we're driving this car. 
 Go easy. 
 Extra partner means lower cost for the rest of us. 
 I'm with Herrmann. There's an old Japanese proverb. 
 Don't let your daughter-in-law eat your autumn eggplants. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 Don't let yourself be taken advantage of. 
 [Station alert] 
 Engine 51, Truck 81, Ambulance 61, possible drowning. 
 [Sirens blaring, horns honking] 
 There. 
 We were playing and all of a sudden, Patrick fell in! 
 Please, help my son. 
 How long's he been under? 
 Three minutes, maybe more. 
 Let's get that straight-frame to the edge of the lake right now. 
 Exactly where did he fall in? 
 Right here. 
 He came up for a second. 
 Then he went right back down again. 
 Keep feeding me line until I hit bottom. 
 Then allow 6 more feet every time I tug twice, all right? 
 When I tug three times, I've got the kid. 
 Please, God, please...  
 Find my boy! 
 All right, he's at the bottom. 
 Three tugs! He's got him. 
 Medics, get ready. 
 Mills, go with the ambulance as backup. 
 Right. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Is he alive? 
 Patrick! 
 Let's put him in the rig now. 
 Pushing epinephrine. 
 Shay, check for lung sounds. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, Patrick. 
 You're in. 
 Let's do a pulse check. 
 Come on, Patrick. Come on. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Wait a second. 
 What? 
 I have a pulse. 
 Wait, are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, pulse, it's...  
 BP's 60 over 40. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. How's the kid? 
 Good. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. Got him warmed up. His BP is stabilized. 
 Lieutenant? 
 Hey, I just heard the news. That's great. 
 Yes. Thanks to you guys. 
 I just want you to know, uh...  
 I didn't... my son was in that water, and I froze. 
 I... I did nothing. 
 Sir... 
 I don't know why I just stood there. 
 I wanted to move, but my feet wouldn't...  
 Listen to me. 
 I've been to thousands of accident scenes, and you never know any given day how someone's going to react. 
 Yeah, but I did nothing. 
 He's my son, and I did nothing. 
 That's cold, dangerous water. 
 You went in there, we'd have been rescuing two. 
 If you hadn't shown up...  
 But we did. 
 And now your boy's gonna be fine. 
 And you're gonna be here to take him home. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 Let me handle this. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Arthur. 
 Sorry for the wait. 
 Ah, not a problem. I appreciate what you guys do. 
 All right, we wanted to open up the lines of communication and let you know our perspective on the whole partnership thing. 
 So, uh, with the Latino girl, we're four, right? 
 I think that's actually "latina." 
 Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah. 
 Look, I'm no math major, but partnership-wise, that's 25% stake each, no? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. 
 The old man definitely did not say equal partnership. 
 He said take care of you based upon what you brought to the table. 
 So construction, hauling, initial investment. 
 I don't have a lot of out-of-pocket money to do any investing. I... so...  
 We're not talking 25% then. 
 Okay, sure. 
 Yeah, yeah. No, I... I get your point. 
 Listen, let's just see what you bring to the table. 
 We'll see how it goes, and we'll make sure that it's fair. 
 Sounds great. 
 Uh, look, I gotta get back to work, but I'll see you tomorrow at the inspection, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hi there, little guy. 
 You know, Daniel's planning on using the fact that I was in therapy and on antidepressants as proof that I'm mentally unstable. 
 Screw Daniel. We're strong enough. 
 We'll handle whatever he throws our way. 
 Well, the lawyer did say there was another option. 
 What? 
 We could offer 50/50 custody. 
 Clarice. 
 I know Daniel will take it. 
 You know, and then we can just end all of this and focus on being a family. 
 Hey, you. Hi. 
 Okay. 
 [Background chatter] 
 Knock, knock. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I'd be dead, you hadn't been there. 
 No, you'd have crawled your way to the front door. 
 Has anybody come talk to you? 
 Uh, some detective from Narcotics named Vikan. 
 Yeah. He's after my badge. 
 He's saying you've gone off the rails. 
 Look, this started out as prostitutes getting a hold of bad dope. 
 That's a Vice case, which is why I got involved. 
 Then it turned into the bad dope being dealt. 
 That's when Narcotics came in. 
 Hey...  
 Then it became about that new gang that I was telling you about trying to push their way in and take over. 
 [Inhales] 
 Laura and the kids? 
 Department's putting them in protective custody until they catch who tried to kill me. 
 Have they been threatened? 
 There's been some hang ups on our home phone line. 
 If this was all about gangs, there is one cop who could have helped out. 
 Don't even think about it. 
 
 
 
 [Keys jingling] 
 [Metal clanking] 
 [Chains clinking] 
 [Clears throat] Uh... my name's Gabr...  
 I know who you are. 
 What the hell do you want? 
 My brother, Antonio Dawson, he works in Vice... 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 He's the guy who put the cuffs on me. 
 You tell him I said hi, okay? 
 Okay, well, this involves him. 
 So if you've got your panties in a twist over how he does his job and that's a deal breaker for you, you just say so, and I'll leave. 
 Continue. 
 [Ahem] He's investigating some bad dope that's been dumped on prostitutes. 
 Uh, it's about some new gang...  
 I've heard all about that. 
 He was shot a couple days ago. 
 But this is more than just him and his family still having a bull's-eye on their chest. 
 Girls are dying out there. 
 If my brother was willing to risk his life trying to stop it, I'm willing to risk mine trying to help him. 
 My ex-partner had a thing he liked to say. 
 "What was the first thing Adam said when the good lord dropped him in Eden?" 
 "What's in it for me?" 
 You know, I came here on the off chance that, despite what happened, you might still care about trying to prevent people from dying. 
 I don't know what your jail situation is. 
 As a former cop, I'm assuming you're segregated. 
 So... maybe by helping out, that would go a ways to getting you some better...  
 Uh, I don't know, accommodations? 
 Then this conversation becomes about favors. 
 Okay. 
 Okay what? 
 Okay, you help me, I'll help you. 
 You're gonna wanna talk to a guy named T.T. 
 He operates out of a two-story on the corner of 27th and state. 
 And I wouldn't advise you come knocking for him on your own. 
 Well, I can take care of myself. 
 Fine. 
 Just tell him Voight sent you. 
 You're looking for someone to testify about the Red Hooks. 
 That's the gang your brother was trying to take down. 
 T.T. owes me. 
 And he's motivated because the Red Hooks are trying to move in on his action. 
 Yeah, okay. All right, got it. 
 T.T. Got it. 
 I'll be seeing you around. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 I don't get this inspector, man. 
 This bar's been here for 30 years. 
 The old man said he never had a problem. 
 Shut up. 
 So how's it looking? 
 Unfortunately, we have issues. 
 Main one being the layout. 
 Your kitchen and bar area are too close together. 
 Mr. Stephanides said that you've always approved it. 
 Ah, well, see, that's a different situation. 
 Mr. Stephanides and I had an understanding. 
 Huh, okay. 
 Let me handle this. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Laughs] 
 God. 
 What are you, posing for a calendar? 
 It's called a football hold. 
 Oh... [Laughs] 
 Thank God he looks like Clarice. 
 [Sighs] 
 Was he crying? 
 No. Not too bad. 
 I must have been out like a light. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, it's fine. Really. 
 I don't mind. [Yawns] 
 Hey, this attorney you guys got...  
 Mm-hmm? 
 Do you think he can locate people? 
 Like? 
 Like Renee...  
 Whaley? 
 Really? 
 No, it's not like that. 
 Eric came to me, asking if I could reach out. 
 I guess they've all tried and failed. 
 He gave me a cell number. 
 I left a message, but... maybe if I just showed up and... and...  
 I don't even know why I'm talking about this. 
 You're talking about it 'cause it might help. 
 What would I even gain from this? 
 Nothing. 
 What? 
 I mean... today at the hospital, you reached out to some father you've never met, but, uh, you don't wanna try and help out someone you almost married? 
 Uh... my name's Gabriela. I'm looking for T.T. 
 [Gasps] 
 Why you asking around about me, bitch? 
 [Whimpers] 
 Voight. 
 Detective Voight. 
 He told me to come see you. 
 You a cop? 
 I'm gabriela Dawson, firehouse 51. 
 I need your help. 
 My brother's a cop, and he was shot last night. 
 Girls are dying from bad dope. 
 You know this because they're trying to move in on you. 
 Voight told me that you can get somebody to testify against the Red Hooks. 
 You come around here again, I'ma blow your head clean off. 
 Do you understand me? [Whimpers] 
 [Footsteps departing] 
 [Door shuts] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Dance music] 
 ♪ 
 [Low chatter] 
 Renee. 
 I will be right back. 
 Kelly Severide. 
 Good seeing you. 
 How you doing? 
 What brings you? 
 Or is this just one hell of an awkward coincidence? 
 No, um... I'm working with Eric at the same house, 51. 
 Oh? 
 And he asked if I'd come...  
 I'm doing fine. 
 Is that what you came to find out? 
 I guess so, yeah. 
 Well, your question's been answered then. 
 Thanks for your concern. 
 ♪ 
 This is probably gonna come as a surprise to you. 
 Jail visitation logs are monitored. 
 Certainly those concerning dirty ex-cops. 
 I got a call. 
 Several, in fact. 
 What's my response gonna be, Gabby? 
 [Sighs] 
 I went there to see if Voight would provide any help with the Antonio thing. 
 Gabby. 
 I can't do anything about what you do off shift, so I will save my breath. 
 I will give you a bit of advice. 
 The news on this is gonna travel fast. 
 Sure as hell got to me quick. 
 So you may wanna bring in a certain someone from this house before it gets on the grapevine and he forms his own opinion. 
 They tried to kill Antonio, and for all I know, they may still wanna finish the job. 
 Plus all those O.Ds...  
 Voight tried to take me out. 
 He's a liar and a crook. 
 I know. 
 But sometimes you gotta, you know, dance with the devil. 
 Really? Is that the way it works? 
 Casey, I didn't feel like I had any other choice. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hey, just do what you need to do, okay? 
 I hope it works out. 
 Hey, Eric. 
 Kelly. 
 So, um, I saw Renee. 
 You're kidding. 
 No. 
 That's great. 
 Or was it? 
 Yeah. No, she's... she's doing fine. 
 Where'd you find her? 
 This bar she works at. 
 Cocktail waitress? 
 Basically, yeah. 
 She good? She happy? 
 Yeah, she seems happy. 
 Thanks. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hopefully I'll hear from her. 
 Hope so. 
 Big day. 
 We just heard the news. 
 Congratulations. 
 I think a toast is in order here, huh? 
 This is vodka my parents brought back straight from the homeland. 
 Now, Herrmann and I are on duty, so we can't imbibe, but don't let that stop you. 
 Nazdarovya. 
 Um...  
 I'll pass. 
 Here, you just, uh, sign where the "X"s are, and you'll be all set. 
 I want to apologize for any misunderstanding. 
 I'll get these into the system right away, and you'll get your fully executed copies in the mail shortly. 
 I was thinking about our first conversation about what it is I bring to the table. 
 I bring a lot of intangibles, I think they call it. 
 In fact, I'd say I bring 25% worth. 
 Ah. 
 You gotta stop this now. 
 You wanna get shot too? 
 Just... let the investigation play itself out. 
 I think I just ruined a friendship. 
 With who? 
 [Station alert] 
 Truck 81, Squad 3, Battalion 25, Ambulance 61, house collapse. 
 1600 block, North Poplar. 
 [Sirens blare] 
 The ceiling fell in! 
 It sounded like thunder. 
 We're gonna take a look. Stay back. 
 Our upstairs neighbor, he's a crazy hoarder. 
 Keeps all these magazines and newspapers. 
 We could hear the floor creaking for months. 
 Have you seen him? 
 Ma'am, will you move to the corner? 
 This building is compromised. Everybody proceed with caution. 
 Main level collapsed into the basement. 
 Can't get in from here. 
 Where's the entrance to the basement? 
 The door's open. 
 Oh, my God, my daughter goes down there with her boyfriend sometimes. 
 Okay, we're going in. 
 Truck and Squad, get all the airbags and cribbing we have. 
 Get it out here now. 
 [Wood creaking loudly] 
 We'll slide 'em in one by one, and then we'll use the cribbing as support. 
 Severide, you're in front. Call out the line. 
 All right, Casey, Herrmann, Capp, Cruz, Hadley, Mills, you guys are with me. 
 The rest of you guys, up to feed the line. 
 Let's go. 
 [Loud creaking, cracking] 
 More cribbing. Cribbing. 
 All right, up on yellow. 
 [Motor humming, wood creaking, cracking] 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Send the Stokes basket down the tunnel. 
 Stokes basket. 
 You guys okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Oh, baby. Oh, my baby. 
 There you go. She's okay, mom. 
 Got banged around a little. 
 There's a young woman in the briefing room. 
 Says she wants to talk to you. 
 You Gabriela? 
 I am. 
 T.T. told me to come here. 
 I'm glad you did. 
 And I can trust you? 
 You can. 
 'Cause I'm not playing around. 
 All right, if I'm gonna help, I need assurances. 
 I need to get out of town for my testimony. 
 They'll kill me in a second if they knew I was here. 
 Whatever you need, it'll be taken care of. 
 You have my word. 
 What do you know? 
 Everything. 
 [Low conversation] 
 Hey, partner. 
 Arthur...  
 I wanna come clean with you. 
 All right, the thing is, I got a checkered history in terms of business investments. 
 Some people, they hoard broken junk. 
 Well, I hoard broken opportunities. 
 My point is is that I'm really looking forward to owning this bar. 
 It's an investment opportunity that I truly believe is gonna work. 
 So what's the problem? 
 You're the problem. 
 You're a bully. 
 You use threats and violence to intimidate people, so if you wanna have at it and smash up my legs just like you did that poor b*st*rd inspector, then have at it. 
 I mean it. 
 Is that right? 
 I'm a firefighter, Arthur. 
 I see a lot of things that, believe me, you don't wanna see. I don't get squeamish. 
 Instead of 25%, you get 1%. 
 1% of what I foresee as being pretty solid profits. 
 All for doing nothing but walking away from our bar and staying away. 
 I'll expect my 1% monthly. 
 Any word back yet from Daniel on the 50/50 offer? 
 No, not yet. 
 Oh, he'll take it. 
 It's the best deal he's gonna get, and he knows it. 
 Well, Wesley is gonna have a good man in his life, regardless. 
 That's nice of you to say. 
 All right, well, there you have it. 
 I can keep it in my room until you're ready to swap it out. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Eric. 
 You sure Renee seemed okay when you talked to her? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 I just got a call from a hospital. 
 She took a bunch of pills. 
 I told you not to go Gabby on this. 
 I know you did. 
 Captain just told me your girl gave a full statement, including the identity of the shooter. 
 This ends it, right? 
 Well, it should. 
 But what did you promise Voight? 
 Uh, I told him I'd return the favor. 
 Whatever that means. 
 You're in bed with this guy now, Gabby. 
 Hey. 
 Someone tried to kill my brother. 
 If you mess with my family, you mess with me. 
 I don't regret what I did. 
 I love you. 
 And I'm proud to be your brother. 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Phone beeps] 
 I'm so sorry, Matt. 
 Ron and I just kinda lost track of time, and something happened with his car. 
 I don't know, it had something to do with the clutch. 
 And it broke down on us right on the eisenhower, of course. 
 We had to call the tow truck, go to the service center. 
 Do you want me to get the driver's card and... or the receipt? 
 Yeah. Get 'em for me. 
 I don't know why I even bother. 
 You got two weeks to find a new place. 
 What? 
 Where am I gonna live? Where am I gonna go? 
 I don't know. 
 You got two weeks to figure it out. 
 He chipped away at me, you know? 
 [Keys clatter] Every day. 
 Your father. 
 He convinced me that, not only wasn't I a worthy mother, I wasn't even a worthy person. 
 I believed him. 
 Then he started to do it to you. 
 Every day another sidelong comment, another criticism. 
 You remember it. 
 I know you do. 
 You started to internalize it, and my worst fear was coming true... that he was gonna do to you what he did to me. 
 So that night he called, we argued... and he said something about you. 
 Something... so cruel. 
 And I snapped. 
 And I went, and I got the gun out of the box that he kept in the closet. 
 And I took the house key that you left out. 
 And I drove across town. 
 And I shot him. 
 Just to shut him up. 
 Just to never hear those words coming out of his mouth again. 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 I know what you thought. 
 But I know you, Matthew. 
 You don't have that kind of anger inside of you, that ability to completely lose control. 
 You're not me. 
 And I think that's what you really wanted to know.
