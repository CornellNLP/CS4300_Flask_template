 Kara :  When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying. I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin. But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman. I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world. To most people I'm a reporter at Catco Worldwide Media. But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm. I am Supergirl. 
 Kara :  Previously on  Supergirl. 
 So our mystery alien is from Daxam. 
 It's a sister world to Krypton. 
 My name is Mon-El. 
 I asked the DEO to release you into my custody. 
 I'm in your hands, Kara. 
 It's your first day of work! 
 No. 
 Yes! 
 (POP MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Thank you. 
 Do you want syrup... 
 Uh... 
 Looks good. 
 Mm-mm. 
 How is it? 
 It fits! That's perfect. 
 Yeah? 
 Yes, now you just need glasses. 
 No. I... I have got that covered, thank you. 
 No, no, no, no. Like real glasses, like mine. 
 Well, they're not real. But, they keep it so that no one knows I'm Supergirl. 
 I'm pretty sure no one's gonna mistake me for Supergirl. 
 No, no, but maybe someday you will want to help people the way I do. 
 In which case, these will come in handy. 
 So no one knows Mon-El is Mike. 
 And who's Mike? 
 You are, Mike Matthews. 
 Uh, Winn got you a birth certificate, Social Security card and everything. 
 Oh, four-nine-eight, zero-zero, three-one-four-five. 
 And oh... Oh, soon you will get your FICO score. 
 Oh. I don't know what any of those words mean. 
 It's okay. You'll learn about it working at Catco. 
 Um... Great? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Thank you for helping me be more... Human. 
 Yeah. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right. 
 These definitely say "Mike" to me. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 So, when I first started working here, I found it helpful to bring coffee to the other assistants to make new friends. 
 Ah, bribery, got it. We have that on Daxam. 
 No, it's not bribery, it's just niceness. 
 Hi. 
 Good morning. 
 Good morning. Good morning. 
 (TELEPHONES RINGING) 
 What... Wait, what are those alarms for? 
 No, no. They're not alarms, come here. That's a phone. 
 You pick it up and you say, "Hello, this is Catco, how may I help you?" 
 Oh, you definitely want to give Eve Teschmacher a coffee. 
 She is James' assistant, the big boss. 
 Eve, have you met our new intern? 
 Uh, thank you so much! 
 Sure. 
 What's your name? 
 Mike. Number 49800... 
 (LAUGHS) No, no, Mike. You don't need to give her your social security number. 
 So I memorized that fake ID for nothing? 
 You mean your real ID? 
 Yes. 
 Hi... Mike... 
 Oh, James. I want to introduce you to our new intern... Mike. 
 Right, Mike. Welcome to Catco. 
 You're... You're the big boss? 
 That I am. 
 Huh. 
 I kind of expected someone a little more intimidating. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 I had Miss Teschmacher put some reports on your desk that should be put in order and filed. 
 So, if you have any questions, my doors are always open. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 And hey, sorry I ran out of bribery coffees. 
 That's okay, I'm actually about to go get one myself. So... 
 Can I go with you? 
 Of course you can. I'll be at the elevator. 
 Okay. 
 Bye, now. 
 Why would you take the elevator? 
 It'd be so much quicker to just fly from floor to floor. 
 Mon-El! 
 "Mike." 
 Mike. 
 Mike, I told you a million times, you are never to show your powers to anyone else. 
 That's the whole point of the clothes and the glasses. 
 This is your desk. 
 Wait, so you're saying I can't use my powers to go through this giant pile of boring paper? 
 No, of course not. 
 And you're telling me that you've never used your powers to do these menial tasks? 
 (SCOFFS) Never. 
 No. Not once. 
 You know you get this little... This little crinkle right up there when you lie? 
 I don't have a crinkle. 
 Yeah, you're crinkling right now. 
 I don't have a crinkle. 
 You're crinkling at the moment. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 It's your first phone call. Think you can handle it? 
 Yeah. 
 Hello, this is Catco. How may I help you? 
 (TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING) 
 Oh! 
 I don't get the chance to win my money back? 
 Uh, with the rate that you play, we'd be here for hours. 
 Your girlfriend would have to put out an APB. 
 Not likely. We broke up. 
 Oh, my God. I'm sorry. What... What happened? 
 She dumped me. 
 She dumped you? 
 Who would do that? 
 She did. Convincingly. 
 Maybe it was just a fight? 
 Well, she said I was hard-headed, insensitive, obsessed with work... 
 That's not so bad. 
 Also borderline sociopathic, and she never wants to see me again. 
 So, I'm pretty sure it's over. 
 Well, her loss. 
 I just thought... You know, she was... (SIGHS) 
 Thought she was what? 
 Look, I appreciate the beer and pool, but I think I need to go home and drink something a little harder and lose my cool. 
 See you later. 
 Okay. Feel better. 
 Hey, thanks again for taking in Mon-El. 
 You make him sound like some sort of stray puppy. 
 He is. He's an outer space stray puppy. 
 (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
 I gotta admit, I'm a little jealous of him. 
 You know, everything is so brand new and exciting. 
 I mean, yeah, he's got a lot to learn though. 
 But he does have me to guide him. 
 He will be an Earthling in no time. Way faster than I was. 
 (TIRES SCREECHING) 
 Whoa! 
 That was close. 
 Yeah, for their car. 
 Seriously? Right in front of Supergirl? I almost feel bad for them. 
 (ALARM RINGING) 
 You do know those bullets aren't going to work on me, right? 
 I'm glad I didn't bring any bullets. 
 (GUN WHIRRING) 
 (GROANS AND GRUNTS) 
 (BOTH GRUNTING AND GROANING) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GROANS) 
 (GUN WHIRRING) 
 (TIRES SCREECH) 
 (CAMERA SMASHES) 
 James! James, are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 (SIRENS WAILING) 
 Oh, no. Your dad's camera. 
 Who were those guys? 
 Any of these look familiar? 
 That one. 
 That's the gun he was carrying. 
 Okay. That is an Anndrannian Photon Cannon. 
 How'd these guys get their hands on alien technology? 
 Are you sure they weren't Anndrannian? 
 Well, they weren't purple with fins, so yeah, I'm sure. 
 Oh, you are lucky this thing hit you before it was fully charged. 
 There's no telling what this might've done to you. 
 We've got to find a way to track these weapons. 
 So it emits phased muon particles. 
 I could maybe come up with a way to detect it. 
 You were warned. The alien invaders are dangerous. Their intentions, malicious. They possess power we cannot hope to match. And their technology, brought from other worlds, is falling into the wrong hands. We should not be opening our arms to them. We should be locking them up and taking their weapons away. You did not heed us, but you will heed the chaos that amnesty has brought. You will pay the price in fear and blood. And you will beg us to save you. We are Cadmus. 
 Kind of a coincidence that Cadmus releases a new video just as criminals get their hands on alien weapons. 
 Not a coincidence if Cadmus is the one giving them the guns. 
 Female reporter on TV :  In another case of humans using alien weaponry, the National City Children's Hospital has been damaged. 
 I don't know about the rest of you, but I sure as hell would feel a lot safer if I had one of those super-powered weapons on me to defend myself. 
 That's not the solution. 
 Well then, what is? 
 The bad guys are running around everywhere with these high-tech weapons. 
 I just think it's about time the good guys got some of our own. 
 Alien guns are bad no matter who controls them. 
 The Second Amendment gives us the right to bear arms. 
 Even if those arms are ray guns. 
 That's what Cadmus wants. 
 They're the ones handing out these weapons, They want us to be afraid of each other. 
 To not trust each other anymore. 
 Well how do you know what Cadmus wants? 
 I... I just do. 
 James : Okay, guys, that's enough. 
 We all know our assignments. 
 We've got a magazine to put out. 
 Let's get it together. 
 James, I don't know what to do. 
 Anndrannian cannons, Pytharian magma bombs. 
 These are weapons that are far more advanced than anything we had on Krypton. 
 Cadmus doesn't care who gets hurt in trying to make sure all aliens get a bad name. 
 Yeah, well, I'm sure you and the DEO will figure something out. 
 Don't sound so defeatist or anything. 
 I'm sorry. I just... 
 I just don't feel like there's a lot that I can do to help behind Cat's desk. 
 You help. 
 I couldn't even save my dad's camera. 
 Oh, oh... It's okay. 
 Are you turning into Miss Grant? 
 How much work did you give that girl? 
 I didn't give her anything. 
 Eve... Hey, hey, Eve, let me help you. 
 Oh, thanks, Kara. 
 And those were the yearly quarterly reports that Mike was supposed to do. 
 Oh, Mike. He is so nice. 
 He was really struggling with his work and it's his first day. 
 So I was just trying to help him out. He's so nice. 
 You want to get this or you want me to get it? 
 Oh, I want to. 
 What are you doing? 
 Eating these red tubes. They're amazing. Like pure joy in food form. 
 No, Mon-El, there's a time and a place for eating candy. 
 Yeah, and it's this time and this place. 
 No, this... This is your place of work. 
 So when James gives you a task, you should be the one to complete it. Not Miss Teschmacher. 
 She wanted to please me. 
 On Daxam, when a woman wishes to please a man... 
 Wherever you're going with that, just don't. 
 We are not on Daxam. Thank Rao. (SIGHS) 
 Look, it... It's gonna be fine. It's still gonna be great. 
 Woman : Kara. 
 Lena. 
 Surprise visit to Catco? 
 No, I'm here to see you, actually. 
 You are? 
 Yeah. 
 L-Corp is hosting a party this weekend. 
 It's for a gala fundraiser for the Children's Hospital after that horrific attack on their new building. 
 I was hoping you'd come. 
 "Gala"? Is that like a party? 
 No. No, it's not. 
 You are literally my only friend in National City. 
 Most people wouldn't touch a Luthor with a 10-foot pole. 
 It would mean a lot to me if you were there. 
 Of course I'll come. I'm honored. 
 I love parties. (CHUCKLES) Can I come, too? 
 No. 
 Oh... Well, of course your friend can come. 
 What's your name? 
 Mike. 
 Of the interns. 
 Well, Mike of the interns, find yourself a nice suit, and I'll see you there. 
 Bye. 
 We are going to a party! 
 (CHUCKLES) Yes! 
 Okay, because the photon cannon is powered by electromagnetism, it left a radiation signature on Supergirl's suit after the blast, so we might be able to put a tracking algorithm... 
 Hello? 
 Earth to Agent Danvers. 
 Sorry, I'm listening. 
 No, you're not. 
 What's... What's going on with you? 
 (SIGHS) Maggie is such a terrible pool player. 
 I mean, I even tried to let her win and she couldn't keep up. 
 Ma... Maggie, the NCPD officer? 
 Yeah. You know she's been kinda down. 
 Her... Her girlfriend broke up with her. 
 Ooh. That's too bad. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know, lately she just hasn't really been acting like... Maggie. 
 You know? She's normally so tough, but now she just seems so vulnerable. 
 I just wish I could help her. 
 Yeah, I try to stay out of other people's relationships. 
 Mm-hmm. Like you stayed out of Kara's relationships? 
 Okay, now, that was different. I was into Kara. 
 It's not like you're into this Maggie person. 
 (SYSTEM BEEPING) 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. We have another attack. 
 This is at Jefferson and Park. 
 Alien tech? 
 Let's see. 
 I'm sure someone's live broadcasting this. 
 Whoa. Uh, yup. I would say so... 
 Kara, there's been another attack. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You made it. 
 (SIRENS APPROACHING) 
 You're being reckless, Mr. Miner. Lazy. 
 Your carelessness is going to get you caught. 
 Not with the weapons you gave us. Nothing can stop us. 
 Supergirl can, if you give her the chance. 
 Your targets are too high-profile. 
 Maybe you should think smaller. 
 I'm never thinking small again. From now on, it's all big. 
 Big bank accounts, big yachts, big money. 
 I have no interest in making you rich. 
 My interest is in molding public perception through the use of these weapons. To sow fear and discontent. 
 To make the populace ready for our leadership. 
 (CHUCKLES) So that's what this is about, You wanna rule the world? 
 No, I want to save it. 
 Lady, I could give a rip about your politics. 
 But if you're so worried about my well-being, why don't you replace the gun Supergirl damaged? 
 Something bigger? 
 Use it wisely. 
 (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) 
 You know, they didn't teach me one thing about anti-gravity guns at the academy. 
 We're analyzing thermal residue to look for any electromagnetic component to these weapons so that we can create a countermeasure. 
 (SCOFFS) Nerd. 
 How are you feeling? Any better? 
 Now I just feel like I got kicked in the gut instead of the face. 
 Well, after you file your report, do you want to go do something? 
 There's a great pinball bar that I know... 
 Or that Food Channel guy's new tapas place opened. 
 I don't really feel like I'm up to it. 
 Come on, you should come out. We'll go and have fun, and celebrate singledom. 
 I don't really feel like celebrating getting dumped. 
 Maggie, that's not what I meant. 
 What do you mean? 
 I just thought that we could go and have some fun. 
 Keep each other company. 
 You and me? 
 Yes. 
 Why? Why, what's wrong with that? 
 Nothing, I just... I think I read you wrong. 
 What do you mean? 
 I didn't know you were into girls. 
 I'm not. 
 Oh. My bad then. 
 No. I mean no offense, Maggie. 
 No, I get it. You're not gay. 
 Right. 
 You'd be surprised how many gay women I've heard that from. 
 Sorry. I just thought you were angling towards something. 
 No, I wasn't. I was just trying to... 
 I'll let you know when we make some progress. 
 What? 
 Hey, have you seen the news? 
 Sixty-three percent of people now support repealing the Alien Amnesty Act. 
 And that's after I published the piece about Cadmus and these other terrorist groups exploiting social media. 
 Yeah, Snapper wants me to write an objective piece about it. 
 I don't know how I'm supposed to be objective when I know what they're actually up to. 
 Have you seen Mon-El? I mean, Mike? 
 I asked him to take this down to marketing like two hours ago. 
 Eve : (PANTING)  Mike, do you have protection? 
 Mike :  You mean, like a sword? 
 Oh, God, get it out of my ears! Ew... 
 (EVE GASPS) 
 What are you two doing? 
 I mean, I know what you're doing. Just stop doing it! 
 (GIGGLES NERVOUSLY) Kara, this is not what it looks like... 
 This is the definition of something looking like what it looks like. 
 Just go, Eve. 
 I think I might have more powers on Earth than we realized. 
 Do you think that I can make any woman fall instantly for me? 
 No, you can't. 
 What were you thinking? 
 That I haven't had s*x in 35 years. 
 You can't do that here! 
 Are you sure? 
 'Cause I've been watching this TV show about doctors, and I'm pretty sure it's okay. 
 No! I am trying to help you fit in and you keep messing it up. 
 Okay, I'm trying very hard to be Mike, okay? 
 But it is not as easy as you make it sound, Kara. 
 I'm used to doing my own thing. 
 Well, you don't do your own thing here. You do my thing. 
 Um, okay. And if I don't want to do your thing? 
 Then find another mentor. 
 Voice :  you will beg us to save you. We are Cadmus. 
 You are lame. 
 Oh, God! Jeez. 
 You do not sneak up on people. 
 Sorry. 
 You're looking for Kara? 
 No. Looking for you. 
 Really? 
 I had some free time on my hands, and... 
 I've kind of missed you from Catco, man. 
 That's nice and kind of weird for you to say. 
 Wait, wait, is your computer frozen? 
 No. 
 So what's the latest around here? 
 You guys have any leads on that gang and where they might strike next? 
 Oh, the DEO mainframe is correlating all incoming data, generating possible targets. 
 How does that work, exactly? 
 Well, for instance, the police got an incoming tip about a sketchy-looking van scoping out the Federal Reserve on Bridwell Avenue. 
 So we analyze the lead and see if it's viable. 
 And... Is it? 
 Oh, well, this? No, I mean I don't know. I don't think so. 
 We have agents on the lookout on the more probable attack vectors. 
 So the Federal Reserve, that's a dead end? 
 Yeah, for now. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna get back to work. Pleasure catching up with you, man. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 
 
 
 (TIRES SCREECHING) 
 (ALARMS RINGING) 
 (SHOTS RICOCHETING) 
 (GROANS) 
 What is it with this town and heroes? 
 (GUN CHARGING) 
 Have fun. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 Everybody out! Everybody out! 
 (TIRES SCREECHING) 
 Run! Get out! Move! 
 Move! Move! 
 I thought male corsets went out of style in the late 1800s. 
 No, I was just shooting some hoops last night and bruised some ribs. 
 (GROANS) 
 You're a terrible liar, Olsen. 
 So, I hacked into the security footage taken at the Federal Reserve that got attacked last night? The same place I told you about yesterday. 
 It's a great disguise, by the way. 
 What are you thinking, huh? 
 You wouldn't understand. 
 Well, then, enlighten me. 
 Because all I see here is a crazy dude with a baseball bat and a ski mask and a death wish. 
 My whole life I've been a sidekick. 
 I have hidden behind my camera while my best friends wear capes, and they're heroes and they save people. 
 And I want to do something good for the world. 
 And I feel like I've waited too long already. 
 Winn, you found the work that you're supposed to do with the DEO. 
 I haven't, not here. 
 But I feel like this is it. 
 I hate to break it to you, dude, but you don't have superpowers. 
 I know, but I can do this. 
 We can do this. 
 Was that... "We"? 
 Yes, we. 
 I mean, I have a black belt. 
 And you're right. I don't have powers. 
 But you... You can make me a suit. 
 You can build me a weapon, and together we can level the playing field. Come on. 
 Hmm, no. No. No! I can't do it. 
 You helped Kara. 
 There's a difference, okay. 
 She can fly. You're just tall. 
 You know, watching my dad's camera get destroyed... 
 It reminded me of something. 
 He gave his life protecting this country. 
 And if I do this, I can honor him. 
 Or you can end up just like him. 
 Winn. 
 What? 
 I'm gonna continue to be that crazy guy with the baseball bat and the ski mask, with or without you. 
 James, guys like us, we are here to give people information, right? To fight with knowledge. 
 There is no shame in that, man. 
 You gotta think this through. 
 You're gonna get yourself killed. 
 A donut? You never eat sugar in the middle of the day. What's wrong? 
 I'm feeling confused about something. 
 Your steps were exceptionally stompy just now. You all right? 
 Where do I start? 
 Mark almost got fired today. 
 Who? 
 Mark, uh... Mike. Mon-El. 
 He doesn't take his job seriously, at all. 
 It's really like he's never worked a day in his life. 
 Well, he's from a different planet. 
 I'm from a different planet, and I had to deal with the awkwardness of seventh grade when I first got here. 
 I helped him get a new identity. 
 I helped him get an internship. 
 I even got him a new pair of glasses for a disguise in case he wants to put on a cape and help people the way I do. 
 He has everything he needs, and yet, he's still a disaster. 
 Well, that's the problem. 
 What, the glasses? I can take those back but I don't think it's gonna make any difference. 
 Sit. 
 When you first arrived at our house, I thought, "Finally, I have a sister." 
 An alien sister. 
 Even better. 
 But I still wanted you to be just like me. 
 To do everything that I did. 
 So I dragged you out to science fairs. 
 Those were so boring. 
 Made you watch scary movies. 
 What do you have against a good old romantic comedy? 
 Forced you to listen to the music that I liked. 
 Yeah, your punk-rock phase was very strange. 
 But finally, I let it go. 
 Let you do your own thing, find your own hobbies, listen to your own weird music. 
 Uh, NSync, first of all, is not weird. 
 And second of all, they are amazing. 
 Mon-El is not you. Just like you're not me. 
 So what works for you might not work for him. 
 You know, people just have to figure out what works for them. 
 Know who they are inside. 
 What they're meant to be. 
 So you're saying, the job, the sweater and the glasses are a bit too much? 
 Not everyone can rock argyle like you do. 
 Huh. (SIGHS) 
 Oh, God. You came here wanting to talk to me about something and I haven't shut my mouth. I'm sorry. What is it? What's wrong? 
 I... 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 What is she doing here? 
 Who? 
 Lena, hi. Come on in. 
 I'm sorry to keep dropping in on you. It's... 
 Hey, I know you. 
 You saved my life. 
 Special Agent Alex Danvers, FBI. 
 She's my sister. 
 This city's smaller than I thought. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, actually, maybe you can both help me. Um... 
 You remember, I told you about that stupid fight club last week? 
 Now it's my turn to ask for a favor. 
 Anything. Shoot. 
 I need to get in touch with Supergirl. 
 Woman : I'm not used to being summoned. 
 Miner : I held up my end of the bargain. 
 People are afraid of these weapons. 
 You got what you wanted. 
 And what is it you now want, Mr. Miner? 
 One last score. 
 You wanna take on Lena Luthor? 
 She's holding an event. 
 National City's wealthiest will all be there, decked out in their finest diamonds and gold. It'll be the mother lode. 
 Plus you'll get that public dazzle you're looking for. 
 The Luthors are smart and dangerous. 
 You don't wanna go up against them. 
 I took down Supergirl. I'm not afraid of some spoiled, rich brat. 
 It's a mistake to underestimate her. 
 You wanna attack that fundraiser, you do it with what you have. 
 Your cause is pure greed, Mr. Miner. 
 Which is fine. I don't hold it against you. 
 But my cause is something far nobler. 
 I'm fighting for my children. 
 My son, my daughter. 
 Their lives depend on the successful attainment of my goal. 
 To end alien influence over our planet. 
 I'm trying to save the world from an alien apocalypse. 
 Do you really think I'm afraid of you? 
 Take on Lena Luthor, and you do it at your peril. 
 We're taking down that party. 
 Supergirl. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yeah, thank you for coming. 
 I wanted to invited you to my party. 
 Kara Danvers told me you were going on with the fundraiser. 
 You can't. 
 It's definitely going to be a target for this gang. 
 Well, that's why I need you there to protect it. 
 With Supergirl in attendance, I know my guests and I will be safe. 
 You like to take risks, don't you? 
 When Corben was after you and now this. Why? 
 Well, you can't live in fear. 
 You, more than anyone, must understand that. 
 Time and again, you risk everything to see justice done. 
 Is it so hard to believe that I feel the same way? 
 Are you one of those people that thinks there's no such thing as a good Luthor? 
 I believe everyone should be judged on their own merits. 
 Then judge me on mine. 
 This party must happen, and I am asking you for your help. 
 I guess I have no choice. 
 Thank you. 
 So Kara and I will see you tomorrow night? 
 Right. 
 Yes, Kara and I will both be at your party. 
 Crap. 
 (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Okay, the Muon Particle Detector will let us know if there are any weapons within 100 feet. 
 Are you sure? 
 Have I ever been wrong before? 
 Okay, this time I'm sure. 
 I see Lena. Commence Operation Doubtfire. Lena! 
 Kara, it's really great to see you. I'm glad you could come. 
 Um, have you seen Supergirl? 
 I'm sure she's on her way. 
 Oh, I am so... Did I spill this on you? 
 Does anybody have some seltzer? 
 Supergirl, I'm glad you could make it. 
 I still think this might be a bad idea. 
 Well, why don't we wait and see how the evening pans out. 
 I'll check the perimeter for any activity, and I'll be back at the first sign of danger. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Kara, you just missed Supergirl. 
 Did I? 
 Golly. 
 James, you're not here to fight crime, are you? 
 No, I'm just here as an upstanding member of the community. 
 Yes, because we agreed that that would be suicide. 
 What's your name, beautiful? 
 Oh, it's you. 
 Um, are you gonna yell at me again? 
 I'm not gonna yell at you... 
 What's wrong with your mouth? 
 I'm not gonna yell at you again. 
 Where's the suit from? 
 Oh, you like it? 
 Yeah, it's nice. 
 Yeah, Eve gave me her little... 
 Her plastic rectangle to buy things. 
 You used her credit card? 
 You're gonna yell at me again. 
 I'm not gonna yell at you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Mike : KEmiss dancing. 
 I used to dance a lot on Daxam. 
 Yeah, we danced on Krypton too. 
 Well, then... 
 Sorry, hold on. 
 (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
 (BALLROOM MUSIC PLAYING) 
 If she wasn't into either of us, there's no way she's into this guy, right? 
 No, couldn't be. 
 (CELL PHONE BEEPING) 
 What is that? 
 Trouble. 
 (LOUD EXPLOSION) 
 (PEOPLE CLAMORING) 
 Don't do anything. 
 My, my... Look how many pretty things there are. 
 Oh, you picked the wrong party to crash. 
 I don't think so, princess. 
 All right, I'm gonna keep this real simple, people. 
 Hand over every ring, pearl, diamond, watch, wallet and no one gets disintegrated. 
 (SOFTLY) Don't even think about it. 
 Did you really think I wouldn't be here? 
 Actually, I was counting on it. 
 (PEOPLE SCREAMING) 
 Hey. 
 (GROANS) 
 (GLASS SHATTERS) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Do you mind? 
 Oh. Is... Is that a Black Body Field Generator? 
 It will be if I can get it working. 
 This whole party... You set a trap for these guys. 
 Yeah, a trap that will fail unless I can get this operational. 
 Okay, so if the Black Body is at equilibrium with the alien weapons, then it will absorb the electromagnetic radiation and shut them down. 
 This is genius. 
 I know, but the frequency and the wavelength, they're a match. So... 
 (BOTH) The induction coil. 
 (GROANS AND GRUNTS) 
 Lights out, Supergirl. 
 Punch it. 
 Oh, we weren't under there, so... 
 I want to talk to the DA. 
 I'm sure he's looking forward to talking to you too. 
 No, you don't get it. 
 I know who gave us those weapons. I know who she is. 
 I can ID her. 
 Well, I'm all ears. 
 Not until I get a deal. 
 Woman : (DISTORTED VOICE)  Can you hear me, Miner? 
 What the hell? 
 I warned you not to get caught. You won't be telling anyone who I am. 
 No, her voice... 
 (GROANS) It's in my head. 
 Goodbye, Mr. Miner. 
 Miner? 
 Call a medic! 
 What the hell is happening? 
 (REMOTE BUZZES) 
 Onto the next. 
 I used to be so terrified to walk in here. 
 Me too. 
 You're really not going to stop, are you? 
 No. 
 (SIGHS) Then God help me! 
 I will help you. 
 What changed your mind? 
 I spent so many years sitting at that little desk out there, just creating firewalls, you know, and just... 
 Keep people from finding out the newest celebrity baby names or how much money Cat spent at Barney's, which is a lot more than you think. Like... (SCOFFS) 
 I wasn't really doing important work. Not really. 
 And you're right, now, I'm working at the DEO, I am, and it's amazing. I get it. 
 Being a hero, it's... It's addictive. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Plus, you know, I would feel bad if you went and got yourself killed when I could've helped you. Blah blah... 
 I've been thinking about my suit. 
 Oh, please. I already have something in the works. Just trust me, okay? 
 Do me a favor, do not run into the line of fire until it is ready. 
 Deal? 
 Deal. 
 And, have you thought of a superhero name? Every superhero needs a name. 
 I got one. 
 Are you gonna tell me? 
 When we're ready... Everybody's gonna know it. 
 Kara : Good morning. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Am I late for work? 
 Kara : Oh, no. You were fired. 
 Yeah, I'm not sure it was my destiny to be an intern. 
 Yeah, I'm not so sure either. 
 So, you're not mad at me? 
 I get the feeling I'm always gonna be a little mad at you. 
 Yeah, I get that feeling too. 
 When I was younger, I had no idea what I wanted to be here on Earth. 
 I had a family to help me and guide me, but... 
 Ultimately I had to make my own choices. 
 I was trying to impose those choices on you because when you landed I was just so excited to have someone to take under my wing... To look after. 
 I never got to do that with my cousin. 
 But you are your own man. 
 And your life here on Earth is going to be very different from mine, and that's fine. That's great. 
 So, does this mean I don't need to get a job? 
 You still need to get a job. 
 Right. 
 But just pick something that you like. 
 And I'll be here to help you, however you need me to. 
 That's what a real mentor does. 
 I got you something. 
 It's a guide to National City. 
 Hmm. 
 Thank you, Kara. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What's a "strip club"? 
 You know, let's just take that page out. 
 I heard what happened. 
 You okay? 
 I've seen some crazy stuff since I joined the Science Force, but that was... 
 That was... 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was worried about you. 
 Look, I'm sorry if I was too forward the other day. 
 That wasn't my place. 
 My whole life has been about being perfect. 
 Perfect grades, perfect job and the perfect sister taking care of Kara. 
 But the one part of my life that I've never been able to make perfect was dating. 
 I just never really liked it. I... I... 
 And, you know, I mean, I tried. I got asked out. I just... 
 I never liked... 
 Being intimate. 
 I just... 
 I don't know. I thought maybe that's just not the way I was built. 
 You know, it's just not my thing. 
 I never thought that it was because of... 
 The other. 
 That... (LAUGHS) Maybe I... 
 I mean... I don't... 
 I don't know. Now, I just... I can't stop thinking about... 
 About what? 
 That maybe... 
 There's some truth to what you said. 
 About? 
 What you said. 
 About me. 
 Hmm. 
 I have to go. 
 I'm glad you're okay. 
 You took a great risk, Miss Luthor. 
 Why didn't you tell me what you were up to? 
 I doubt you would've believed that a Luthor just wanted to see justice done. 
 Well, I couldn't have stopped them without you. 
 Thank you. 
 Who would've believed it. 
 A Luthor and a Super working together? 
 (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
 I hope we can work together more in the future. 
 Me too. 
 Oh! I didn't realize you had company. 
 Would you excuse me, Supergirl? I have to take this. 
 Of course. 
 Sorry I missed your party. 
 What else is new? 
 What can I do for you, Mom?
