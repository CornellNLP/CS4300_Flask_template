 Previously on "Chance"... 
 Patient's medicating for type 2 diabetes. 
 My son cannot take care of himself. 
 I don't know what you know about my son's history, but I want to be very clear: Darius is dangerous. 
 To himself, but also to others. 
 It seems like D's father is keen to be rid of him. 
 But he's been looking for him for years. 
 He's a wealthy and powerful man and he hates that boy. 
 Jaclyn, it's Eldon. 
 Things have gotten really bad. 
 Aah! [Grunts] 
 I need you to call me, please, as soon as you can. 
 You have to pack enough to last you both a while. 
 Go somewhere, stay there until you hear from me. 
 She was actin' weird, started tellin' me this wild story. 
 What was the story? 
 About this doctor. 
 He told her he was gonna help her get clean, but he just wanted her for some kind of s*x slave and she busted him in the head and got away. 
 Gayland Parks. 
 Jaclyn : We're leaving. 
 What do you mean, leaving? 
 Now he thinks they're after him, whoever he competes with in this s*x business of his that I'm not supposed to know anything about. 
 It was such a beautiful couple of days, imagining what could be. 
 You're such a good man. 
 You must want things, but, you don't take them. 
 You let me breathe. 
 ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ 
 [Eerie music plays] 
 You're insane. 
 How insane are you? 
 I don't know why you're even here, but you need to leave, right now. 
 Jaclyn, I'm not leaving without you. 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 [Music pulses] [Laughter] 
 Sandro looking for you. 
 He says Ray called. 
 I'm walking this guy out. 
 Tell Sandro to take a pill. 
 What the f*ck, Jackie? 
 Where the f*ck you goin' now? 
 [Laughter] 
 [Speaking foreign language] 
 No? 
 Not thirsty. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Music pulses] 
 [Sirens wail in distance] 
 Si Sandro o alguien pregunta, no nos has visto pasar por aquí. 
 Nos fuimos así a la licorería. 
 Sí. 
 ¿De acuerdo? Jaclyn. That's not gonna work. You're a good person. Yeah, you said that before, but look where we are now. Maybe I'm not as good as you say. Maybe I'm stronger than you think. I want to talk to Jaclyn. I know you do, but I'm here now, Doctor. What happened to Raymond? Did you do that to him? Did you do it for me? [Chuckle] You are insane. Where's your car? For us to discharge any patient who's not fully alert and oriented... I was told that his blood sugar had stabilized. For the moment, but his condition remains precarious. Now, your son needs to know why he's here. He needs to understand what to do, moving forward. Doctor, look, I'm sorry, okay? You have all averted a tragedy, without question, but my son is a violent man and I've tried to be very clear about that. I can have an ambulance here this afternoon. I believe you, but until your son can sign his own waiver, or until he's released to the care of another doctor, what you're asking for is going to have to wait. This is protocol. Just tryin' to think of your safety, doctor. And protocol is for our safety, too. If you'll excuse me. [Monitor beeps] Woman over PA: Nursing supervisor, dial the operator, please. Jim Harris heads up the endocrinology division at Cal, so if they'll only release Darius into the care of another doctor, I'll call Jim. By the way, do we know what Darius was doing at Golden Gate Park? All right, check into the ambulance services, anyway, see what they have available. f*ck protocol. Right. [Footsteps retreat] Cardiology to ER. [Door slams]  Cardiology to ER. [Ominous music plays] [Beeping] [Alerts beep] [Sustained beep] [Clatter] [Wheeze] [Panting] That's where... Hey. This goes down one of two ways, buddy. You with me? Yeah. [coughing] No! [Panting] [Coughs] You'll be happier with me not around, so keep your mouth shut. They'll find you soon enough. Ah. We good? Yeah. Okay. [Wheeze, gasp] [Panting] You better take a f*ckin' meter. You're lucky to be alive. It's in my left pocket. [Grunts] Test strips and lance are in the other pocket. [Grunts] Stay between 70 to 150. It gets double that, drop what you're doin' and find help. Thanks. I'll keep that in mind. [Suspenseful music plays] [ Man speaking Asian language  ] [ Man continues speaking in Asian language  ] Cardiology, please dial extension 255. Cardiology, 255, please. [Indistinct conversations] [Dog barks] [Door opens, keys jingle] [Suspenseful music climbs] [Gasp] You still want Jaclyn here? Freud once said that he'd come to regard any sexual act as involving at least four people, so. [Chuckle] Well, according to the sign, the maximum occupancy of this room is five, so, we're good. f*ck him, anyway. Freud. I have toys. Turn cumming into a religious experience. Or so I'm told. Hmm.  This  is nice. Let me show you. No. Fine. Try something else? There's more to try. You could hit me. Master me. Stop it. Just stop it. Uh-oh. Is the doctor in now? Yes. And I want Jaclyn here. She's not coming back, buddy. What can I say? It's just you and me. You walked with her and held her hand, you made love to her in your bed, and, now, you want her here. Your special lady friend. But she's not coming. Because you won't let her? Is that it? 'Cause you're afraid to? [chuckle] Afraid? Listen, sometimes it feels like there's ones in here who could swallow me with a glass of water. You must be so tired. [Scoff] You don't even know, Doc. So, tell me. You work at that massage place because you want to, or because he makes you? Let's just say we like to pilfer a john now and then, because it drives him f*cking nuts. Who's "we," you... you and Jaclyn? Well, Jaclyn does the books. She's good at that. [Lighter flicks] Good at taking a beating every now and then, too. Well, we all take those. But they hurt Jaclyn the most. Two farmers meet on the road. One has a pig. He's holding the pig up to eat the leaves of a tree. And the second guy says, "What are you doing?" The first guy says, "I'm feeding my pig." And then the second guy says, "Oh, that must take a lot of time." First farmer says, "What's time to a pig?" That's a riddle. Or what is it? No, I hate riddles. It asks you to consider whether the baggage you carry is really necessary, or if it could just be set aside, if only you'd try. [Exhales] [Sinister music plays] That girl you stalked. Was she a patient? Raymond showed me her file. He wanted me to see it. Thought it would scare me off. [Suspenseful music fades] But it didn't. [Exhales] Honestly, it... made me jealous. [Eerie music plays] But enough about me. Tell me about her. [Cellphone beeps, vehicle horns honk] Allan's Antiques. This is Carl. What's up, boss? Oh, my God in heaven. Where are you? Walking down California. You don't sound so good, son. I'm right as f*cking rain. Just listen. Meet me in Huntington Park. [panting] Bring... my... meds. Please. [Music plays nearby] [Chime] ♪♪ [Speaking Asian language] Suicide watch. For how long? Couple o' weeks. Give or take. My memory of it's not the best. Did you see her after, ever, seen her since? [Sirens wail in distance] No. And, between her and me, there was no one else? Not like that. Not like you. There was my wife. She didn't know what she was getting into. Still doesn't. But Suzanne does. Is that why she agreed to help me? Help us both. So, tell me about Gayland Parks. What was he to you? [Suspenseful music plays] A mark, a client, a john to be pilfered? The f*ck do you know about Gayland Parks? I got into his computer. Read some of his reports. How did you do that? Does Raymond know you did it? [Scoffs] Are you afraid I'll tell him? You know things aren't always safe with me. That's a risk I'm gonna have to take. He is your knight, after all. No, he isn't. But he wasn't always what he is now, either. What changed him? I don't know. Maybe it was me. Maybe that's what I do. [Chuckle] What do you think? Do you think that, too? I think that you should confess. I think you should come clean. I think you should plead self-defense in concert with diminished capacity. [Laughs] No, listen. Listen to me. Listen! This is what I do. I spend half my life in court. I've seen these things a hundred times. I know what I'm talking about. He is not gonna survive prison. You will. You will do time. You'll go to a... a state hospital, or maybe a minimum- security prison. It's not gonna be easy, but when it's done, it's done. And you're free. And I'll be waiting. You're f*cked, is what I think. We're kind of both f*cked, but, at least he likes me. [Suspenseful music plays] I have a friend. A cop. Oh, fantastic. An honest cop. [scoff] A unicorn. Is that who helped you get the computer? No. He can help. He is helping. I can help you get well. He can help with the rest. You could beat this. You could be whole. In a way, it's kind of beautiful, how crazy you are. Agh! But you are crazy. And a shitty liar. [Sigh] Jaclyn's been doing the Euro Massage books for years, now. End of the week, every week. And, every week, I skim a little off the top. My mad money, my rainy-day fund. Plus, I make copies. The books should be enough to hang Raymond, if he doesn't hang you first. Help me get them and then help me go. All right? I thought you said that leaving was an impossibility. I'm talking about disappearing. There's a difference. [Suspenseful music plays] [Streetcar bell clangs] [Speaking indistinctly] [Dog barks] Can't sit there, if you're not gonna... I'll play you for a soda. What do you have? IOU. You can have my robe. Man, no. 10 bucks. I'm good for it. Ride's on the way. Just thirsty, is all. 10 bucks for a soda? Crazy m*therf*cker is what you are. You... You need to go away. 5-minute game, no penalties, no bonuses. [Dog barks] [Streetcar bell clangs] I don't have 5 minutes, crazy man. I got one. I win, you walk. I win? You get a soda. Go. [Chess pieces clacking] 
 
 [Dog barks] [Suspenseful music plays] [Indistinct voices nearby] [Streetcar bell clangs] [Indistinct voice nearby] [Indistinct voice nearby] [Suspenseful music plays] You play a pretty good game. For a crazy f*ck in a bathrobe? You play a better one. I haven't seen that opening in a long f*ckin' time. [Dog barks] [Honk-honk] Damn, man. Hey, you  must  be thirsty. No. You won; I lost. Stay here. D. What have I told you? You bring the meds? Of course. Awesome. Let me get a $20. [Vehicle honks in distance] [Indistinct voice nearby] [Bird caws] [Dog barks] 3 minutes. [Suspenseful music plays] I told you, man. Don't f*ckin' ask me again. Sell me a quarter. Come on, man, quarter, and I'm gone. You already gone, bathrobe. Ooh! [thud] [Wheeze, hyperventilating] [Wheezing, hyperventilating] Your game is good, but you need new shoes. Now, give me a soda. Peace and love. [Can cracks open] You're not well. And what was all that just now, when you might be dying? Training exercise. Practice focus under extreme duress. Need to get back to the f*cking chess table. My game's gotten weak. Show me what you brought. I'm taking you to a hospital, a different one, and don't argue with me. D! [Panting] Okay, then. Where do  you  want to go? Take me to the shop, first. I need to get beautiful. [Knocks rapidly] Hola,  Jackie.  ¿Cómo estás? Me voy, Lina. [Dog barks in distance] Venga, pues, pásele. [Dogs bark] [Child speaks indistinctly] [Sinister music plays] [Child shouts] [Metal squeaks] [Children shouting in distance] [Dogs barking in distance] [Door opens] Cuídate,  Jackie. [Sinister music plays] [Dogs barking in distance] [Keys jingle] It's all here. How much he makes, how he cleans it, where it goes. Your cop friend will understand it, even if you don't. Jaclyn. [Melancholy-suspenseful music plays] She said you weren't coming back. She just wanted to be the one with you. I think she gets tired, being the strong one. How do you know that? I don't. I just feel it. The lines blurring. We had a deal. Now I've gotta go. [Suspenseful music climbs] What if you didn't have to? What if Raymond was gone? He's not. He will be. You hope. But, even if he is gone, I can't be here. Look at us. I could never have imagined what's happening to me. The lines blurring. It's... [crying] it's terrifying. I know that it's right and I know it's because of you, but, it's confusing. So much that it hurts. It will hurt less, eventually. But you have to stop running. You're right. I know you're right. [Melancholy music plays] Take me to the bus station. ♪♪ [Chime] 450. That's what it says. What's it supposed to say? What it is. There's a reason that you were in the hospital, D. You can't play with this. You have to go back. What part of "they found me" don't you get, Carl? I'm f*ckin' lucky they didn't find this place, too. Doc Chance was smart, must've told the EMTs to lie, if Frank asked. I don't know how he thought to do that. He is a gift from the Almighty. And if he were here now, he'd be on my side. And he would tell you to go right back to... Well, maybe not that hospital, but to a hospital. I don't need one. The medic'll take care of me. The medic is not a doctor. He's probably saved more lives than any doctor you know. That's why he had you on animal tranquilizers when we first met, hmm? I busted my ankle. It hurt like a b*st*rd. The label even read, "Not for human consumption." Listen, if I go under before we get there, you just keep driving, okay? It's an hour away. You've made yourself into a fort, son, impenetrable, lethal, and I understand that. But the one person left who can bring you down is right there, inside those walls with you. [Suspenseful music plays] I take  no  pleasure in violence. Now, that said, were you to plot a singularly brutal way to bring about the demise of your [falters] father, I'd be there to help you. [Suspenseful music continues] It'd all be blood under the bridge to me. [Panting] I know, brother. Now, get me home. - [Indistinct voice over PA] There you go. Thanks. Next person in line. It's better if you don't know where. You're probably right. I'll be in touch. When it's safe. What time does your bus leave? 20 minutes. Stay with me? Of course. Bus arriving [indistinct] 15 minutes. Bus arriving [indistinct] 15 minutes at gate number 3. [Nearby voice speaks indistinctly] [Nearby voice speaks indistinctly] Agent : Next, please. [Alert warbles] [Warble] Hey. She what? Then what happens? She's probably just got it turned off. Yeah. Sit tight. I will. My daughter. I sent them out of town to be safe. I couldn't tell them why they had to go and Nicole got angry. She left the house they're staying in. She won't answer her phone. Christ! Go. It's okay. I want you to. I'm sorry. Don't be. I am. For everything. I know, in another age, the world, they would've burned me for a witch. Go. Talk to your cop friend, tell him everything. Find your daughter. Make your life whole again, like the good person you are. [Eerie music plays] You're a good person, too, Jaclyn. You're soldiering on in the dark. Remember that. ♪♪ [Indistinct voice over PA] ♪♪ It's right over there. Hi. I need to see Detective Hynes. Is he available? [Indistinct voices nearby] Got a guy out here for Hynes. Okay. Detective will be out in a minute. Wait over there. [Telephone rings nearby] Hanson? Yes, sir. [Telephone rings nearby] What can I do for you, sir? I was looking for Detective Hynes, Kevin. He's not around, but I can probably help, if you tell me what it's about. Okay. Do you happen to know when he might be here? 'Cause hi-his cell k-keeps going to voicemail. Do you mind me asking, when'd you last talk to him? A couple of days ago. Why? He didn't come in for a shift today. Didn't call, either. Ollie. Lou wants you. Give me one minute, okay? [Suspenseful music plays] [Buzz] Voice over PA: Nurse, dial 182, please. Dr. Forest, please dial 118. [Whimsical-suspenseful music plays] [Footsteps approach] [Ominous chord strikes] Yeah. What do you want? Me? Nothing. But someone else wants to talk to you. [Suspenseful music climbs] [Indistinct conversations] [Whispering] Have a seat. [Sirens wail in distance] [Buzz] Darius left the hospital. He's good at that, as I'm sure you know. I also know that you're not his doctor, but you are a doctor, so I'm sure you're aware of the danger to his health, and to others. Would you like a drink? Look like you could use one. Yes, sir. Please. What do you want? What else would I want? Your help. I don't know where he is. I want to gain conservatorship of him. The recommendation from an esteemed neuropsychiatrist, such as yourself, could clear that path considerably, if not completely. Sir. [Slurp] D is an adult. He's chosen to separate from his family of origin. Darius's  judgment cannot be trusted. Your judgment of his judgment is subjective. He has rights. He's mentally disabled. I have a responsibility here, and so do you. I'm not his doctor. Remember? I'm just his friend. Which I find interesting, your friendship. And the question as to what he might've done to earn that "friendship." [Suspenseful music plays] He witnessed the death of his mother and his brother. He sustained a traumatic brain injury. He was essentially deserted and then repeatedly raped as a child, his pleas for help, ignored. None of this done by him, all of it done  to  him. [laughs] Okay. Then help him, Doctor. Help your friend. And then, I'll help you. Speak a number, any number, out of your  wildest  dreams. Does D have money? I'm sure I've seen this before. Trusts and estates up for control, greed disguised as loving concern. No matter how much money you  say  you have, it's just not enough? No, but that's not it. At least, not completely it. And fear for strangers, the safety of strangers, [chuckle] that's not it. And fear for D's safety, that's sure as hell not it. [Slurp] My guess is that you haven't slept a solid night in two decades. You're afraid you're gonna open you're eyes and he's gonna be bending over you in the night. Of course, you get him confined, then, that fear goes away and you can sleep. Although God knows how. [Eerie music plays] You made D. Or, more to the point, I suppose, you  allowed  him to be made. You volunteered your son to be a victim. [Suspenseful music plays] [Buzz] [Eerie music plays] [Suspenseful music climbs] [Suspenseful music climbs] [Ring] - [Click] Man: Yeah. Wh... [gasping] Where is she? We found her at your place. Now, she's here. 'Til you give the boss what he wants. Yes! I'll gi-I'll... whatever he wants. What does he want? What?! His wife. You bring her back by tomorrow. I can't. I can't. I took her to the bus station. She... I... She didn't tell me where she was going. She's gone! All right? Please. Come on, man, just please, please, don't hurt my child. [Suspenseful music plays] [voice breaks] Hello? You bring his wife back to him, or he gives your daughter to me. [Door slams] [Suspenseful music plays] [Rattling] Is he here? D left the hospital. He's safe. There was someplace he needed to be. What place? Blackstone has my daughter. He took her. I need D. Were you followed? No. Are you certain? Yes. [Sigh] Come with me. [Suspenseful music plays] [Dirge plays] [Crickets chirp] Jesus Christ. How much further, Carl? I'm violating a trust by bringing you here. What do you mean? Sworn to secrecy about this place, and now I'm coming uninvited, with a guest, and without D. D is here? It's where I left him, yes. I cannot guarantee how we'll be received here. f*ck, I have done this, Carl. I have done all of this. This is... This... This... Uh, dominoes falling, this is all on me. You wanted to help someone. Is that so bad? You are a doctor, after all. Meaning "do no harm," not "run amok like a mindless..." Man? You know, you're one of those, too. And what do men do, after all, besides run amok? We heap upon ourselves more trouble than that ordained by the gods. And no one gets out alive. It's what you do while you're here that counts, or not. Or not. Ahh, this is it. [Suspenseful music plays] We should walk from here. That's what they call it. What are you gonna do? [Crickets chirp] [Wind blows] [Indistinct conversations] Carl's here. [Indistinct conversations] [Indistinct conversations] ♪♪♪♪ [Laughter nearby] ♪♪ [Grunting] Man : Get on your feet. That's right. [Continues indistinctly] [Grunting] [Grunting] [Grunting] You all right? Good evening, gentlemen. [Indistinct conversations] We're here for D. You been here before. A physician. A friend of D's. Wait here. [Insects chirp] [Wind blows] [Eerie music plays] [Suspenseful music plays] Big dog.
