 Previously on "Chance"... 
 Mrs. Blackstone. I'm Eldon Chance. It says here that you separated from your husband after he struck you in the face. Shortly thereafter, you became aware of a second personality... Jackie Black. 
 I hate the name Jackie. The only person who calls me that is him. 
 Chance : The patient states that Jackie is daring and extroverted. 
 How was the lecture? 
 Tell us about it. 
 Graduate student from the math department was lecturing on the axiom of choice. 
 Why? 
 Would you care? 
 We're a predatory species. 
 I mean, that's the world I deal with every day. 
 And next time we coincide like this... that's on you. 
 Back there. 
 [Grunting] 
 What's that about? 
 What you do with it is up to you. 
 What are you saying? 
 That what you just did was some kind of audition? 
 No. 
 Why? The rules? 
 You think that's how he feels? 
 There are no victims. 
 Only volunteers. 
 ♪♪ 
♪♪ 
 Oh, God. 
 I want to make love to you with my mouth. 
 Stop it. 
 Stop it. Stop it. 
 No. No. Stop. Stop. 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 [Breathing shallowly] 
 [Whimpers, exhales sharply] 
 You okay? 
 Was it Jackie? 
 I... 
 I don't know. She di... 
 She didn't say her name, but... 
 ...yes, I believe it was. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 I need to go. 
 Did you... Did you drive? 
 Come on. We'll call you a cab. 
 It'll be okay. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 You were still up? 
 Yeah, well, after what happened earlier, sleep didn't seem like an option. 
 So what happened after the two of you left the restaurant? 
 Nothing. 
 He likes to keep people off balance, in suspense. 
 I didn't see him after we left. 
 At least that's how I remember it. 
 And has... has Jackie ever done this before? 
 Has she ever appeared somewhere outside the context of Raymond? 
 'Cause you said that you had these periods that you can remember, these blank spaces, and then Raymond was there. 
 But he's not here now. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe it's something about you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hmm. 
 Chance : Yeah, well, I admit I was intrigued. 
 It was the words as words that interested me. 
 It's the words as words I like to escape from now and then. 
 I didn't know he was violent, not until that day in Marin. 
 ♪♪ 
 Jaclyn :  We had sandwiches, a bottle of wine. 
 [Chuckles] 
 It was all kind of perfect. Driving home, we had a flat. 
 [Car door closes] 
 He jacked up the car without loosening the lug nuts. 
 It was no big deal. 
 [Grunts] 
 Funny, actually. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Screams] 
 Like being struck by lightning on a cloudless day. 
 On our way to the hospital, he said he was sorry. 
 He told me how it would be if I tried to leave. 
 When we got home... he wanted s*x. 
 Before all that happened, there was no Jackie Black. 
 I met with an Oakland ADA, and, uh, we were doing some cases for them pro bono for one reason. 
 You think that will give you some leverage... someone to talk to about Raymond? 
 Have you heard anything I said? 
 He's not omnipotent, Jaclyn. 
 There are limits. 
 Not until he's dead. 
 Him or me. 
 Well, if that's what you believe, why did you want to meet? 
 You're my knight. 
 Jackie said that, too. 
 Then I guess she was right. 
 [Horn blaring] 
 Mine? 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 The lady will be right down. 
 Is there somewhere you can go during the day? 
 Tell them you're tutoring and see Suzanne? 
 I don't know. Maybe. 
 [Sighs] 
 That you should even think of all this, the way you stood up to him in that restaurant. 
 I hardly stood up to him. 
 You did. 
 And don't think he didn't notice. 
 Oh, my God. 
 So what is all this? 
 Oh, this is, uh... 
 It's just a hobby of mine. 
 This connection between sense of smell and memory... 
 [Sniffs] ...interests me. 
 Mmm. That's nice. 
 Like a desert after the rain. 
 Other pathways run through the thalamus. 
 Sense of smell has direct access to the limbic system, which is why emotional, visceral responses to scent are so powerful. 
 Sorry, I, uh... I can get very boring about this. 
 No. 
 I like it when you talk like a doctor. 
 Well, the cab's here. We should probably go. 
 No, one more. 
 You pick which one. 
 Something you like. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, this is from the south of Italy. 
 Jaclyn?

 [Door opens] 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 You scared me. 
 You're never here this early. 
 Yeah. Sorry. 
 Did you sleep here? 
 [Sighs] Not really, no. 
 I had some things I had to get caught up on. 
 Oh. For this afternoon? 
 The conference, your presentation. 
 sh1t. 
 Oh, you forgot. 
 sh1t. sh1t. sh1t. 
 Jaclyn Blackstone... 
 I thought we'd given her to Suzanne Simms. 
 Yes, we have. 
 Do you want to maybe get us some coffee? 
 This was in the hallway. 
 Somebody left it by the door. 
 It's not the best wrapping job I've ever seen. 
 What is it? Who's it from? 
 I know a way you could find out. 
 [Door closes] 
 Aah! 
 ♪♪ 
 Lucy : What is it? 
 It's this. 
 There was no note. 
 Mrs. Eldard. 
 She has an arts-and-crafts studio in North Beach, and she was crushing on you a little bit. 
 You put those two things together and... 
 Well, I broke it, so... 
 Here. 
 Well, maybe I can fix it. 
 Oh, and your finger, too. 
 Lucy : Suzanne called. 
 She said your text woke her up, your cellphone is off, and you owe her a latte. 
 Right. 
 Suzanne : You should have told her to go. 
 Yes, I should have, but the point is Jackie Black is real. 
 She's real, and I saw her. 
 You still don't believe me. 
 You know as well as I do dissociative disorders of this type almost always arrive much earlier in life and from childhood abuse. 
 I mean, we didn't deep-dive into her history, but Jaclyn did say she had a wonderful childhood. 
 But you said that the work you were doing was behavioral... strategies by which she'd say no to her husband. 
 That's true. 
 Saying you had a wonderful childhood does not make it so. 
 Well... 
 You know, my collection of perfumes? 
 She found it, she wanted to try one. 
 The reaction... 
 ...was like some past horror that she's not even aware of. 
 Hmm. 
 Now, I can't pursue that, but you could. 
 Just wait a second. 
 Let... Let me ask you something. 
 How did Blackstone know to come to that restaurant? 
 I don't know. 
 He either overheard her talking to me or he's tracking her cell or he followed her. 
 Or she told him where she was going. 
 Who? Jackie or Jaclyn? 
 And why would either one of them do that? 
 I don't know. 
 But I guess I'm going to try to find out. 
 I was speaking to a friend who just happens to have a daughter who just happens to be having trouble in pre-calculus. 
 They're in Oakland, in the hills. 
 And they're okay with you seeing Jaclyn there? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh, you are the best. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I am the best. 
 El, I need you to accept the role you played in this... how you drew Blackstone's focus, and you turned something bad into something even worse. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know what? Scratch that. 
 From now on, I need you to stay the hell away from her. 
 I promise. 
 Oh, really? 
 That... That... That's just not good enough. 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 I swear. 
 How's that? 
 That's a little better. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Lucy : He says he knows you. 
 I told Mr. D... 
 It's okay, Lucy. 
 We have to talk. 
 [Sighs] 
 You want to step in here? 
 Carl said you were asking after the guy who bought your stuff. Yeah. 
 Uh, the Russian, Mr. Morozov. 
 I wouldn't go there, brother. 
 I-I don't understand. 
 What's to understand? 
 Message you left got the boss a little spooked. 
 Carl's got a reputation. 
 Anything goes out his door is something he's authenticated personally. 
 He can't just tell people he was wrong or sh1t's been f*cked with. 
 He cancelled the check he made out to you, pulled it out in cash. 
 Count it if you want to. 
 We good? 
 Yeah. 
 How's it coming with your cop buddy... 
 Blackstone? 
 I've been thinking about him. 
 [Sighs] 
 He threatened me. 
 When was that? 
 Last night. 
 At a Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. 
 I'd gone there to meet Jaclyn, and he showed up. 
 What kind of threat? 
 He asked if I had kids, and he started talking about humans as a predatory species. 
 He said if we met again, there'd be trouble. 
 And then this morning, there was a menu from the Chinese restaurant on my car. 
 [Sighs] 
 There's ways of handling a guy like that because right now, he's the feeder. 
 I don't even know what that means. 
 That sh1t in the alley... How did I work that? 
 [Sighs] 
 It was very fast. It was very violent. 
 I made sure  they  were reacting to  me. 
 People talk about self-defense... all bullshit. 
 If I'm defending, I'm losing. 
 I want the other guy defending while I attack. 
 That's how you win in the real world, in a real fight. 
 You want to get down with this cop, you need to turn the tables on him. 
 Right now Blackstone is the feeder, you're the receiver. 
 You've got to turn that around. 
 And how would I do that? 
 You might hire it done. 
 [Chuckling] What? You? 
 [Scoffs] 
 First thing would be to gather intel. 
 She says he's dirty. What does that mean? 
 It's not that hard to kill a clean cop. 
 They put themselves in dangerous situations all the time. 
 Any one of them could go wrong. 
 But a cop who's dirty... his whole life is a dangerous situation. 
 You just need to pay attention. 
 Where does he go? Who does he see? 
 When is he most vulnerable? 
 I think... And I know I asked, but I think I'm gonna have to stop you there. 
 I want to handle this on my own. 
 No sh1t. 
 How's that going? 
 It's a work in progress. 
 Awesome. 
 But while you're progressing, he's still the feeder. 
 So think about that.

 Woman : Here you go. 
 Hi. 
 Okay. 
 Ah! Okay. 
 A map, a program. 
 We are in Saavedra Hall, apparently, hosted by the Center for Geriatric Medicine. 
 Exciting. 
 Here's a name tag for you to wear around your neck. 
 But will it support my weight, is the question, in the event that I elect to pass the time hanging myself? 
 That's not funny. 
 It's Vladimir and Estragon. 
 "Waiting for Godot." 
 You know, when they brought "Godot" to America, it opened in Miami in this dinner theater. 
 It was billed as the laugh riot of two continents, and it bombed. 
 So then they put it on for prisoners in Sing Sing. 
 People said it wouldn't work. 
 They wouldn't get it. It was too highbrow. 
 Of course, they did. 
 Laughed their asses off, 'cause it spoke to them where they lived. 
 In Sing Sing? 
 In a place of existential dread. 
 To make a meaningful cognitive assessment, you first have to determine where the person lives existentially... in which state... anxiety, depression, isolation. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That is what the methodology we're here to present is gonna account for. 
 Could really change the game for patients. 
 That's what we want to do. It's what I want to do. 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Chance. 
 Eric Martin, Stanford Geriatrics. 
 How are you? 
 Good, thank you. How are you? 
 Good. We met at, uh, Fort Miley Vet Center. 
 That's right. 
 May I introduce Lucy Baek, my office manager? 
 Hi. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Grad student in clinical psych at Berkeley. 
 Oh, fantastic. 
 Nice to have you here with us, Ms. Baek. 
 Thanks. 
 And I will see you onstage in, uh, 15. 
 15 it is. 
 Can't wait. 
 Good. 
 Hey. 
 Give me a pound. 
 Give me a break. 
 Dr. Martin : In addition to his work as a forensic neuropsychiatrist, you may also be familiar with his interests in the field of cognitive assessment. 
 Dr. Eldon Chance. 
 [Applause] 
 Chance : Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you, Dr. Martin, for that very generous introduction that I will try to live up to. 
 Uh, good afternoon, everyone. 
 How are we feeling today? 
 [Audience murmurs] 
 Now, I wanted to begin by... 
 [Microphone feedback] 
 ♪♪ 
 I, uh... 
 I'm sorry. That... That, uh... 
 It's... not hard to understand the... uh, the popularity of... of, uh, assessment tests that claim to offer a global composite score. 
 I... We [sighs]... 
 We have to be, uh, aware of the... the danger. 
 Lucy : I mean, you had this, and then all of a sudden, it was like panic mode. 
 I-I didn't know what to do, if I should go up there or what. 
 Are you all right? 
 I-I have to stop. 
 I'll just meet you at the car. 
 What's going on? 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 I-I don't know. I'm sorry. 
 [Cellphone ringing continues] 
 Yes? 
 Christine : Please tell me Nicole is with you. 
 Oh, my God, Eldon. 
 I called the school, and I called the police. 
 She left school before lunch. 
 W-What did the police say? 
 "Who are her friends?" and... 
 [Voice breaking] "Who was the last one to see her?" 
 Do we know? Who... who was the last person? 
 Yeah, it's Shawn. It's Shawn. 
 But all she could say was she saw her before lunch. 
 She was heading toward the marina, and she thought she was coming home. 
 I mean... I mean, even if she's gonna lie, she'd still call. 
 Do we have... 
 Do we have Shawn's number? 
 Yeah, I talked to Shawn, so did the police. 
 Are you listening? 
 This is my fault. This is all my fault. 
 What are you talking about? No, please, don't do that. 
 Please, just focus. I need your help. 
 I can't do this by myself. 
 [Tires screech] 
 Neil : Hey. Hey. 
 Neil. 
 Sorry, I-I went all over. 
 Nothing. 
 Hey, uh, I'm... I'm gonna drive. 
 I've got to drive. 
 No, no, where are you going? 
 I just... It's better than sitting here. I can't. 
 I really tried everywhere I could think of. 
 Well, maybe you don't know her as well as you think. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Nicole : Daddy? 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Oh, God! Nic! 
 Dad? 
 Oh, God! 
 Ohh! 
 Oh. Are you okay? 
 What ha... What happened? 
 No, I'm fine. It's okay. 
 Jesus! 
 Wha...? 
 Does... Does your neck hurt? 
 Dad, can we just go, please? 
 No, come on. Nic, look at me. 
 Open... Open up your eyes wide. Wide. 
 Now follow my finger. 
 No, dad, I'm fine. 
 Nic. 
 Okay. All right. 
 All right. Well, is this the guy? 
 Thank you, sir, for letting her use the phone. 
 You want to tell me what happened? 
 Some asshole hit me and took my backpack... and my phone. 
 Well, we'll get you another phone. 
 What did he look like? 
 I don't know. A homeless guy. 
 Did he hit you with his fist or with his open hand? 
 His hand. 
 Where did this happen? 
 Dad, do we have to talk about this now? 
 Well, when do you want to talk about it? 
 Your mother's been calling everyone. 
 She called the school, your friends, police. 
 Where were you? 
 The park. 
 I'd been for a run, and I was gonna go to the yogurt place. 
 Alone? 
 You skipped three classes, Nicky. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Well, the important thing is you're okay. 
 Are you in pain? 
 No, daddy. 
 I'm fine. 
 Thanks for coming to get me. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 I have to take this. 
 Thank so much for calling, Holly. 
 Uh, wait just a minute. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, come here. Let me... 
 Ohh. 
 Nicole : It's fine. 
 Um... this is, uh, Principal Stein from Havenwood. 
 Would you let her know what's happening? 
 Okay, come here. 
 Hello, this is Eldon Chance. 
 Dr. Chance, it's Holly Stein. 
 I don't want to keep you. 
 Just... Is there any news? 
 Yeah, she, uh... She called. She's back. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Thank you for following up. 
 That's very kind of you. We appreciate that. 
 Oh, of course. 
 Just while I have you, though, something came up that I was gonna share with your... uh, Christina, anyway, but because she said she called the police... 
 [Knocks] 
 ...I just thought you both needed to know now. 
 Chance : Hey. 
 How's the cheek? 
 It's okay. 
 Show me? 
 Do you mind? 
 No. 
 [Sighs] 
 I talked with Principal Stein. 
 Your mother's talking to her now. 
 You left an art box in your last-period class. 
 They went through my stuff? 
 Well, yeah, they did. 
 I guess under the circumstances, people were getting desperate. 
 Well, there was nothing there, so... 
 There were some stems and residue. 
 You know the school's drug policy is zero tolerance. 
 That's why everyone there is loaded all the time. 
 Stop it! 
 Now I need to know the truth. 
 Could what was there have had anything to do with what happened tonight? 
 Did you have more in your backpack? 
 Or you were going somewhere to buy something? 
 I could do that at school. 
 I told you. 
 It was some crazy guy. 
 Mrs. Stein says that your grades have slipped. 
 What difference does it make if I'm leaving anyway? 
 Oh, come on, Nic. 
 You're not serious about that. 
 How was your speech? 
 Mom said you had to go to a conference to talk about an idea you had that might make money. 
 Yeah. 
 You remember when I used to fly to Seattle a lot? 
 That was for this. 
 Some doctors up there I was working with. 
 And we kind of dropped the ball, but now it looks like there might be some renewed interest. 
 So how'd it go? 
 A work in progress. 
 You know that book reminds me of when we were sitting on the porch. 
 You were about 3, and you said the words "outer space" just like that, out of the blue. 
 And I asked you if you knew where outer space was, and you pointed down the street and said, "Down there." 
 Well, I guess that's where I thought it was. 
 What's going on with you, Nic? 
 Why did it happen? 
 Why did what happen? 
 Was it mom's fault? 
 Was it because of her and Neil? 
 It was no one's fault. 
 How can a divorce be no one's fault? 
 I'm sorry. I don't have any better answers. 
 We'll talk about your grades in school... all of that... later. 
 But for now, no more going out alone, okay? 
 We good? 
 We good? 
 Good night. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Is this a bad time? 
 Who is this? 
 You don't have anything to say to me now? 
 Holly : And while the usual consequence in a case like this is expulsion and we've tried very hard to be cognizant of the big picture here and to be sensitive to how hard it can be on the child, and it is to that end that we are willing to consider the possibility of Nicole's continuing at Havenwood, albeit under strict probation, of course. 
 And moving forward, I think let's discuss the parameters of continuing... 
 That won't be necessary. 
 I'm sorry? What won't be. 
 It won't be necessary for us to discuss anything further. 
 I'm afraid I don't understand. 
 Which part? 
 Besides the obvious hypocrisy of pretending that Nicole faces expulsion over a teaspoon of herbs when the Layton girl was selling pills on campus last fall, and yet I just saw her in the hallway. 
 Okay, what are you doing? 
 I'm being the feeder. 
 It's very simple. 
 We thank you for your consideration, but we don't need it. 
 I think the last day of the exams is 10 days from tomorrow. 
 That'll be Nicole's last day at Havenwood. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 You're the feeder? 
 I grew weary under that woman's assault... what they will accept, what they won't, sensitive this, probationary that. 
 If we had money, they'd happily take it, zero tolerance be damned. 
 I thought it was time to end the charade. 
 Oh, just on your own, without any further discussion? 
 What's to discuss? 
 Unless you want to pick up the tab? 
 What is funny? 
 The look on Ms. Stein's face. 
 No. No, it's not. 
 And you and I will talk about this later. 
 Walk with me a second. She'll be right back. 
 Listen. 
 I'm gonna get busy with that apartment in Berkeley. 
 You keep saying that. 
 Yeah, I'm saying it, and I'm doing it. 
 But I need you to keep your promise about not running alone, okay? 
 You still think what happened was my fault. 
 I'm not saying it's your fault, okay. 
 I just... It pays to be watchful. 
 That's all. 
 Now what? 
 Now nothing. 
 I love you.

 Aah! 
 Chance :  The patient is a 26-year-old male admitted for psychiatric hospitalization. Tox screen positive for methamphetamine. 
 Man : [Screaming] Calm down. Calm down. 
 Prior to admission, patient violated a restraining order issued ex parte on October 8, 1989, in San Diego County Superior Court and was subsequently arrested. 
 [Sighs] 
 The patient was a post-grad year three doing a residence in psychiatry at Mass General. He was on call when he encountered the protected party. They subsequently began a relationship of several months, which ended when she abruptly broke things off and moved to San Diego. Unable or refusing to accept this decision, patient took a leave of absence and followed. For the next few months in San Diego, patient persisted in trying to maintain unwanted contact until ultimately protected party retained counsel, and a restraining order was issued, which patient violated shortly thereafter resulting in his arrest. Diagnosis... in part... delusional erotomania. De Clérambault Syndrome. Everyone feels better when a thing has a name. 
 Doctor : How are we doing here? 
 A little calmer now, I hope. 
 You awake? 
 Eldon. 
 Dr. Chance. 
 [Pounds on door] 
 What's up, brother? 
 You were right. 
 The sh1t has hit the fan. 
 Jesus. 
 This stuff legit? 
 You're asking me if kiddie p0rn is legit?! 
 How the f*ck should I know? 
 That's some of the most hateful stuff I've seen in my life, and yet there it is. 
 It just popped up on my screen. 
 I was about to give a lecture. 
 That could have projected onto screens in front of 100 people. 
 That's f*cked up. 
 Yeah, f*cked up and career-ending. 
 How could that even happen? 
 Time bomb. 
 Get access to someone's computer, input information, hide it, set it to open on a given day. 
 Day comes... file populates the computer. 
 You could also rig it to go to e-mail. 
 Everybody you know could get this stuff. 
 [Sighs] 
 Laptop always with you? 
 Yeah. 
 Then I'd say you got hacked. 
 I'm not the expert, but it can be done. 
 Perp is good enough. 
 He's a cop. 
 Couldn't be someone you pissed off in court? 
 Crazy patient? 
 My daughter was attacked. 
 Some stranger in the street took her bag, hit her in the face. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is Blackstone, D. I know it. 
 And there's more. 
 Some stuff from the past. 
 He broke in. 
 He left it in my car... some medical records, legal stuff. 
 It's old news, but still damaging if it fell into the wrong hands. 
 What would that look like? 
 You lose your license? 
 They kick you out? 
 No, I'd still be a doctor, but I'd be compromised. 
 No one would hire me. 
 You add the kiddie p0rn to that, and all bets are off. 
 This guy is out to crush me. 
 He's out to show you he  can  crush you. 
 There's a difference. 
 He could have you whacked, but he's trying to scare you instead. 
 That says something. 
 My guess... You're scaring him. 
 How? 
 That's what you need to find out. 
 Know what your enemy is afraid of. 
 That's power. 
 You know, we, uh... 
 You know, we talked about this once, how I could... hire it done. 
 I'm not talking about killing anyone. 
 Just taking him down. 
 Going through channels. 
 Yeah. Weak, but doable. 
 Right place and time, grab his computer, download files. 
 Might give you something. 
 You could also f*ck with him a little. 
 Give him a time bomb. 
 I...I don't want to get into that. 
 This is not a game. 
 The question is not "Is it a game?" 
 The question is "Who sets the rules?" 
 Who's the feeder? 
 I'll take that to mean you're ready to talk numbers.
