 ♪ I've got dreams ♪ 
♪ dreams to remember ♪ 
 Henry, look at us. 
 We're ridiculous. 
 Henry : A ridiculous love story. 
 This is the last time I heard from her. 
 It was a week after she disappeared. 
 She only wanted time to think, to be alone. 
 I'm sorry, but I don't think she  wants  to be found. 
 Should have known mom would be living under an alias. 
 Sylvia Blake? 
 And I should have known she'd combine the names of our favorite poets. 
 To think that she lived so close all these years. 
 All these years? 
 Dad, she was in her 70s when she left. 
 And? 
 Well, that might not seem so old to  you,  but to us mortals... 
 Yes. You're right. 
 Chances are she died years ago. 
 Certainly beats the alternative that she simply forgot about us. 
 Hey, hey, come on. That's not the mom I remember. 
 Why don't we go to her last address and see who else might remember? 
 Yes. 
 I'll drive. 
 Unh! I'm not letting you get anywhere near my car. 
 Sorry, dad, but  I'm  mortal. 
 ♪ But I saw him kiss you again and again ♪ 
 75 bucks for lessons. 
 And... and that's not including the lift tickets, the ski rental, the food? 
 I'm the one taking them skiing, remember? 
 But can't we at least try to love them on a budget, Karen? 
 [Click] 
 Eh... hello? 
 You there? 
 [Scoffs] [Cellphone beeps] 
 That was... amazing. 
 Seriously, why are you here? 
 I thought you and Isaac were in Paris. 
 That fell through. 
 What, the trip or the relationship? 
 Both. 
 Sorry to hear it. 
 Thanks. Sorry for  me. 
 Look, Jo, the only reason I took time off is 'cause you were gonna be gone. 
 I don't want to get stuck here partnered up with these bozos. 
 It's a family ski trip. Just go have a good time. 
 Henry and I will hold down the fort. 
 Oh. You didn't hear? 
 Gone? Where did he go? 
 I don't know. 
 Big guy said he needed a few personal days. 
 I don't blame him. 
 Did he say why? 
 Look, just because I'm now Henry's best friend doesn't mean I know everything. 
 Lucas, what are you not telling me? 
 Henry didn't... he... he didn't take a few days off because of me? 
 Wait. What... what... what... What does that mean? 
 Are you guys, like, um...? 
 No. What is... no. I don't know what that is. 
 I mean, it's totally cool if you guys are. 
 You'd automatically be my favorite couple ever. 
 You know, and then if you had any single lady friends, we could double-date. 
 I'm obviously looking for 8s and above. 
 Lucas. 
 That's the last we'll speak of it. 
 But at least you know how I feel. 
 No, no, no. Hey! 
 Where is he? 
 [Sighs] 
 Tarrytown. 
 Look, Abe came in here asking me to find out about his mother, who disappeared in the '80s. 
 He didn't give me the full story, but, apparently, she was on the run from something. 
 So, what's the story with Abe's father? 
 Never said. 
 Well, there's your answer. 
 Henry : Are you certain this is the right road, Abraham? 
 Second right after the big red barn. 
 I'm positive. 
 What would Abigail have been doing living all the way out here? 
 There's not another soul for miles. 
 Maybe looking for peace and quiet. 
 Or maybe she was hiding. 
 From what? 
 Me. 
 [Engine shuts off, car doors close] 
 That can't be her. 
 Of course not. 
 Henry : Excuse us. 
 We're looking for Abigail Morgan. 
 Who did you say you were looking for? 
 Sorry. Uh, Sylvia Blake. 
 I haven't heard that name in a while. 
 You knew her? 
 She used to live in my guest cottage. 
 But that was a long time ago. 
 See, the reason we were asking is I'm her son. 
 You don't know what happened to her? 
 No idea. 
 One morning, she was just gone. 
 Did she mention her life before she came here to tarrytown? 
 Did she mention a family? 
 I think she just needed some time to herself. 
 I believe she was getting over a bad breakup. 
 Couldn't have been easy at her age. 
 I did save a box of her things. 
 I guess I always hoped she'd come back for them someday. 
 Oh, may... may I see them? 
 Yeah. 
 Hellebores. 
 According to legend, the poison from the winter rose killed Alexander the Great. 
 A historian  and  a horticulturist. 
 Your mother planted those flowers. 
 Well? What do you think? 
 [Siren wails] 
 What is that odor? 
 It smells of warm garbage. 
 That's New York. You'll get used to it. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Youse must be the Morgans. 
 Yes. Uh, I'm Henry, and this is my wife, Abigail. 
 The radiator's acting up. 
 And if it starts hissing, I want you to beat on it, unless you want the pipes to explode. 
 Oh, and, uh, welcome to America. 
 Are you sure this is a good place to raise a family? 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes. 
 [Abraham fussing] Close your eyes. 
 Go on. 
 [Fussing continues] 
 There, there, Abraham. 
 For my English rose. 
 [Chuckles] 
 How did you keep it alive all that time on the ship? 
 Well, water, fertilizer, and long walks on the  Queen Mary's  sun deck. 
 Oh, Henry. 
 I believe I  am  going to like it here. 
 [Sighs] 
 Maude : Something wrong? 
 See how the earth has subsided? 
 When a body decomposes in a shallow grave, the earth sinks in a telltale manner. 
 Uh, he was a gravedigger in another life. 
 Do you have a spade? 
 [Shovel clanks] 
 It's her, isn't it? 
 [Siren chirping] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Indistinct talking, siren wailing in distance] 
 Vance : Dr. Morgan. 
 I'm Sheriff Vance. 
 So, what is a New York M.E. doing all the way out here? 
 My companion and I were searching for a missing family member when we discovered the... 
 Do you mind telling them to be more careful? 
 Perhaps I should supervise. 
 Not without the NYPD's authorization. 
 Detective Martinez. He's with me. 
 Sorry I'm late, doctor. 
 Sheriff, the NYPD would be happy to help with this case. 
 Oh, it's nice of you to offer, but without the proper paperwork, you know I can't really do that. 
 Our O.C.M.E. has a state-of-the-art lab, which I'm guessing you don't have here. 
 [Laughs] 
 Plus, our presumed victim was a resident of New York City, so, technically, it is  our  case. 
 [Scoffs] You want a bunch of old bones? 
 They're all yours. 
 Sheriff. Think I just found something. 
 Abigail : [Echoing] I think we're going to love it here, Abraham. 
 I really do. 
 It's mom's. 
 That's her key chain. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Yes. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Lucas, why don't you, uh, start us out? 
 Oh. Uh... yeah. 
 Well, the remains of a Jane Doe. 
 Decomposition suggests she's been dead for at least 25 years. 
 Depressed skull fracture, sharp-force trauma, and likely cause of death. 
 The object punctured the brain stem, at which point, she was left conscious but essentially paralyzed. 
 Oh, this is weird. 
 Hmm. 
 Uh, the growth plates are still open. 
 That's impossible. 
 No. Look here. 
 My God, you're right. 
 Which means she was no older than 20 years old. 
 Which means that she couldn't be... 
 Excuse me. 
 Abraham! 
 What happened to her? 
 [Sighs] It's not Abigail. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Thank God. 
 I've just been going crazy... 
 Trying to imagine what kind of monster would have done that. 
 But this doesn't get us any closer to knowing what happened to mom. 
 Nor whose bones were buried in her backyard. 
 But assuming that the murder had something to do with Abigail's disappearance... 
 You have my word, Abraham. 
 I'll find out what happened to her, even if it takes me the rest of my days. 
 Now, this is the last of mom's stuff. 
 Now, I mean, no one says we have to open it. 
 What if we find something we don't want to find? 
 Well, like what? 
 I've been searching for your mother for 30 years. 
 Whatever's in that box, you're gonna have to live with forever. 
 Whatever we find is better than knowing nothing at all. 
 [Scoffs] 
 It's just a bunch of crap. 
 I mean, after all that, we get nothing! 
 Not a clue as to what happened to her. 
 The young woman we exhumed from her yard had Abigail's keys on her person. 
 There must be a connection. 
 Jo : You got something? 
 I was just going over the body. 
 Lucas noted fractures in the right clavicle and radius. 
 His theory, along with the fatal blow, that these injures were sustained during the fracas. 
 And what do  you  think? 
 Well, looking at her wrist under magnification, it appears that her bone was moved back into alignment. 
 She had it set. 
 By a medical professional. 
 And then struck over the head and killed before it had time to heal. 
 And then she was buried in a nurse's backyard. 
 I believe we found the connection between this case and Abraham's missing mother. 
 Hey. 
 Searched through Tarrytown's missing-person reports and found this one from April 1985. 
 Belinda Smoot. Age 20. Height... 5'2". 
 Looks like we found our girl. 
 How would you like to take a trip with me, detective? 
 Henry : Just think. 
 You could be in Paris, but instead, you're in a Tarrytown emergency room. 
 I made the right choice. 
 But seriously, you should have come to me first. 
 Lucas? Really? 
 Abe  went to Lucas. 
 I would have come to  you. 
 There aren't many people I trust in this world. 
 You're in rare company. 
 Well, good. 
 I was afraid I made things a little uncomfortable the other night when I showed up. 
 It would take a lot more than that to make me uncomfortable. 
 Okay, Belinda Smoot... Admitted April 7, 1985, with fractures of the wrist and collarbone. 
 Hmm. 
 Care to guess the name of the nurse who took care of her? 
 Abe's mother? 
 Now we just need to figure out how Belinda ended up in her backyard. 
 Well, maybe there's someone who worked here back then. 
 Her. 
 A veteran nurse if ever I saw one. 
 Excuse me. 
 How can I help you? 
 You don't happen to remember a woman by the name of Sylvia who used to work here in 1985? 
 She was just one of those people you never forget. 
 You know what happened to her? 
 One day, she just didn't show up for work. 
 Sylvia left the way she came, just like that... 
 Out of the blue. 
 Do you remember a patient Sylvia treated the night before she left? 
 The girl in the car crash? 
 Wow. Good memory. 
 That night was hard to forget. 
 Sylvia had just finished treating the girl when a hit-and-run came in. 
 Man : Incoming! 
 Motorcycle hit-and-run. 
 Don't know how long he was bleeding on the side of the road. 
 He's in bad shape. 
 We're going to fix you up. You hear? 
 Do you know how the girl with the broken arm ended up at Sylvia's? 
 Sylvia took the poor thing home with her. 
 She was always doing that sort of thing. 
 Look... on the file, she marked the injury a 273. 
 It's police code for domestic assault. 
 That would explain why Sylvia took her home... to protect her. 
 Does the file say who checked her into the hospital? 
 Uh, Teddy Graves. 
 Do you recognize that name? 
 It explains why Belinda didn't want to press charges. 
 Teddy : I'd like to remind the jurors to keep an open mind until all of the evidence has been presented. 
 You've heard the arguments of counsel, as well as my instructions on the law and the opinions of your fellow jurors. 
 Court is adjourned. 
 [Gavel bangs] 
 Judge Graves, Dr. Henry Morgan, office of the chief medical examiner. 
 I wonder if I could ask you a few questions about a case. 
 Talk to one of my clerks. They'll try and fit you in. 
 I have a very busy docket. 
 I don't think you understand. 
 This case involves you personally. 
 Detective Martinez, homicide. 
 Belinda Smoot. 
 You dropped her off at a Westchester County hospital on the night of April 7, 1985. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 Forgive me. It was, uh, 30 years ago. 
 A young woman tripped and fell at a party. 
 I was home from Princeton on spring break at the time... 
 Anyhow, she was inebriated, so I offered her a ride to the E.R. 
 How gallant of you. 
 And then? 
 I never saw her again. 
 'Cause she was murdered and buried in a shallow grave. 
 That's all I remember. 
 I wish I could give you something more to help with your case. 
 You just did. 
 An Alfa Romeo Spider. 
 Are you the original owner? 
 The reason I ask is that the fracture to Belinda's collarbone is consistent with a car crash. 
 And speaking of automobiles, the Italians never did quite get British racing green right, did they? 
 Of course, you made matters worse by repainting it after the accident. 
 What accident? 
 The night that you and Belinda crashed, of course. 
 Like you said, there was a party and drunken merrymaking, I imagine. 
 But instead of tripping down the stairs, your companion hurt herself the same way you hurt your car... in a hit-and-run. 
 There was a motorcyclist admitted to the E.R. 
 Same night as Belinda. 
 And the only witness to your crime was murdered that same night, too. 
 You know what I'd do if the D.A. brought me a case like that, based on conjecture, without a single witness or piece of evidence? 
 I'd throw it out. 
 [Engine turns over, revs] 
 Did we just accuse a federal judge of murder? 
 And, damn, did it feel good. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Do me a favor, Martinez. 
 Next time you plan to take a vacation, take it. 
 Let me guess. 
 You just got a call from a disgruntled federal judge? 
 Accusing a man who's been sitting on the bench for 20 years is just plain stupid. 
 Did Henry put you up to this? 
 Let me just run the case for you. 
 This isn't our case. 
 It's a 30-year-old cold case from someone else's jurisdiction, which is why you're going to give it back to that county, along with those bones. 
 And tell Henry to stop wasting our resources. 
 What's up? 
 Hey. I thought you were on a ski vacation. 
 Yeah, just checking this in before I hit the road. 
 Can't trust them Hanson boys around a loaded gun. 
 What are you working on? 
 Well, I  was  working on a hit-and-run involving a federal judge with the possibility of a criminal cover-up. 
 Hmm. Sounds juicy. 
 Yeah, well, too bad I have to give it back to the Tarrytown sheriff. 
 Hey. We'll be heading through Westchester. 
 You want me to do some digging? 
 Well, there's nothing to dig up. 
 The judge ran over a guy, killed the only witness... 
 The woman in the car with him. 
 Other than the guy he ran over. 
 Is  he  still alive? 
 The motorcyclist. 
 Do you think you can go by the hospital, find out what happened to him? 
 You are the best. 
 [Bells jingle] 
 Lucas, what's the hurry? 
 No time to talk, doc. 
 I got some hot merch that needs unloading. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. We do not deal in stolen antiques. 
 But what do you got? 
 I dug up some dirt. 
 On whom? Judge Graves? 
 No. Like,  real  dirt. 
 You mean incontrovertible evidence? 
 No...  Dirt  dirt. 
 What the hell? 
 It's the soil from Belinda Smoot's grave. 
 It's like a virtual treasure trove of clues, if we only had a lab. 
 Too bad Lieutenant Reece put the kibosh on us. 
 What do you say, Abe? Do you think he's ready? 
 Ready for what? 
 Whoa. You have your own lair. 
 As you can see, we have much of the same equipment we have in the lab. 
 You're a beautiful man. 
 Just when I thought you've peaked, you just go and take it to a whole new level. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Knock it off, before one of you puts out an eyeball! 
 Sorry, Jo. 
 Listen, that file you wanted... Motorcyclist who got run over... 
 There's no record of him. 
 But we have a first-person account from a nurse saying he  was  admitted the same night as Belinda Smoot. 
 Somebody must have stole it. 
 Judge Graves? 
 Henry. I must read this to you. 
 It's so romantic. 
 A poem? Whose? 
 Um, Wordsworth? Shelley? Byron? 
 Yeats, you old fuddy-duddy. 
 "When you are old and grey and full of sleep and nodding by the fire, take down this book and slowly read and dream of the soft look your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep." 
 Shall I continue? 
 Don't stop, whatever you do. 
 Abigail :  "Dearest Henry, please forgive me for taking so long to write. I needed this time to realize what I've known all along... That I don't wish to live without you ever again. I've found the perfect place for us here in the country." 
 
 
 
 Abe : Henry! 
 What's wrong? 
 It's a letter from Abigail, dated April 1985. 
 She goes on and on describing her cottage and her flower garden and root cellar down by the river, saying that she wanted us to be a family again. 
 Don't you see? 
 It means that she never gave up on us. 
 Yeah, but I'm afraid that's... not all it means. 
 Yes. 
 The fact that she never sent the letter means that something terrible happened. 
 Hey. Guys. I think I found something in the dirt. 
 Check it out. 
 A piece of jewelry off the victim. 
 Huh? Looks like an earring. 
 No, it's a tiepin. 
 It's got some writing on it. 
 Yeah, some sort of a motto. 
 Is it Latin? 
 "Dei sub numine viget." 
 "Under God she flourishes." 
 Whose motto is that? 
 I don't know. 
 Good work, Lucas. 
 I'll, uh, I'll run this by Detective Martinez. 
 You recognize it? 
 It's from an eating club at Princeton, and it was found in Belinda Smoot's grave. 
 Get out of my chambers. 
 Not until you tell me what happened that night. 
 I already told you. Hey! 
 You hit a motorcyclist, and your companion got hurt. 
 You took her to the E.R., and you told her not to talk. 
 You threatened her. 
 Belinda was scared, so she went home with the nurse, and you followed her there. 
 That's not what happened. 
 You murdered an innocent girl because you knew her story would cost you all this... 
 A life of doling out justice from on high. 
 But where's the justice for Belinda?! 
 I had nothing to do with it! I swear! 
 Ohh! 
 The nurse whose cottage Belinda was murdered in that night... 
 What did you do to her?! 
 Man : Hey! 
 What did you do to her?! 
 You okay, judge? 
 Yeah. 
 What did you do to the nurse?! 
 [Keys jingle] 
 Man : He's all yours. 
 I shouldn't have accosted a federal judge without consulting you first. 
 Henry, what's going on? 
 I told you... Abe's my oldest, closest friend, and his mother's disappearance is a festering wound. 
 No. Why does a 30-year-old case have you acting like this? 
 Who is she? 
 Abe's mother. 
 No. Who is she to  you? 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Martinez. 
 Yep. 
 Okay. I am on my way. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Judge Graves just walked into the station house. 
 [Door opens] 
 Before we talk, I'm obliged to remind you of your 5th Amendment right... 
 I know my rights, detective. 
 Belinda Smoot wasn't some, uh, girl who I met at a party. 
 We had known each other since middle school, um, since before my parents sent me off to Exeter. 
 Uh, spring break of my junior year at Princeton,  uh, we had a fling. 
 The spring she was murdered. 
 I had nothing to do with that. 
 What about the hit-and-run accident? 
 Happened, uh, exactly as your colleague said it did. 
 [Engine revs] 
 I was drinking. I was driving too fast. 
 [Tires screech] 
 I never saw him coming. 
 I went to check on him, and... 
 It was clear he wasn't going to make it. 
 I wanted... to go to the police, but, uh, Belinda... wouldn't let me. 
 She was... afraid that her boyfriend would find out that we had been together. 
 Her boyfriend? 
 Yeah, some townie. 
 Belinda said he had a gun, and if he found out about us... 
 Apparently, uh, he showed up at the hospital when he heard that she was hurt. 
 You said, uh, she left with the nurse that night... 
 Because she was afraid of him. 
 You didn't think it was suspicious that Belinda completely vanished? 
 I didn't know she was gone. 
 Two days later, I was back in Princeton. 
 You didn't try to contact her when you went home? 
 Belinda made it very clear she wanted nothing to do with me after I killed that man and left him on the road. 
 Never called her family, her friends? 
 Did they even know she was gone? 
 I'm not proud of what I did. I've spent my life trying to make up for it. What is that? It's the medical file... Of the man I killed on the night of April 7, 1985. You stole it from the hospital? Well, like you said, I had a bright future. I didn't want any skeletons in my past getting in the way. [Door closes] Ohh. How long are you gonna do this, Henry? Do what? [Sighs] Torture yourself with the life that mom imagined for the two of you in the cottage with the beautiful little flower garden and the root cellar. Where are you going? The root cellar. [Knock on door] Henry. What are you... Um... Do you want to come in? That's very kind of you to offer, but, um... [Sighs] In her letter, Abraham's mother made reference to a root cellar down by the river. When you surveyed the crime scene... I didn't see one. You don't think Abe's mom was locked in a cellar? [Sighs] Something in my heart tells me Abraham's mother never left that farm alive. [Breathing heavily] [Thud] [Thudding] [Both grunting] This is it. [Sighs] These are her preserves. [Cellphone ringing] [Cellphone beeps] Hey, Hanson. Yeah, um... listen, I can hardly hear you. I'm... I'm in a root cellar. L-let me... let me call you back from a landline. Be right back. Mike : So, I checked if Belinda had any visitors. Nobody signed in. But who else hangs out in the E.R. with a gun and doesn't have to sign in? Cops. [Engine shuts off] [Gun cocks] You're trespassing on an active county crime scene. [Sighs] You. You were Belinda Smoot's boyfriend. You killed her and buried her. Wait. Before you kill me, I need to know... What happened to the nurse? What? What did you do to her? You're worried about the old lady? I think you missed the point, doc. Drop it! [Gun cocks] Drop it! [Gun thuds] How'd you like to take a ride into the city, sheriff? [Handcuffs click] Are my eyes playing tricks on me, or was that a sheriff you just brought in here wearing handcuffs? Yeah, you know that case that you said was not ours? It is  now. He just pulled a gun on Henry. He did what? Why? When I discovered the bloody uniform he was wearing the night he killed Belinda Smoot 30 years ago. And you brought him  here? Well, what else was I supposed to do... Take him to the sheriff's department? I'll call Internal Affairs to come pick him up. But in the meantime, no one with a badge goes near that man. Have I made myself clear? Yes, ma'am. Loud and clear. I wasn't talking to  you. [Door closes] Let me tell you what I think happened on the night of April 7, 1985. You showed up at the E.R. with a hit-and-run victim. What you didn't expect to find there was your girlfriend. Vance : Motorcycle hit-and-run. don't know how long he was bleeding on the side of the road. He's in bad shape. You were seized by a jealous rage. No one's accusing you of murder. Belinda's death was an accident. Her injuries sustained from a fall, perhaps. I was... I was drunk when I showed up. [Grunting] Get... off! Belinda slipped and hit her head. I tried to help her, but... And you buried her in the backyard. Tell me... What happened to the nurse that was taking care of Belinda? I waited outside the house till she left with some guy. Who? I didn't recognize him. 30-something. Dark hair, slight build. As soon as they were gone, I went in and had it out with Belinda. And the nurse, she... she never returned? No. But her landlady did. She was the only other person that lived out that way. She knocked, And then I... I buried Belinda. That doesn't make any sense. I'm telling the truth. No, no, you said that the nurse left with a man. How long after did the landlady knock? A couple minutes. Five Max. She lived on a dead-end road, not another property for miles. Why would the landlady knock? Surely, she would have seen her driving the other direction, unless... She never made it down the road. [Door opens] According to the sheriff, Abraham's mother left with a man. And then... I heard. We need a map. [Computer beeps] If Sylvia left going this way and the landlady showed up five minutes later without having passed her, her car would have had to go off the road somewhere... Here. Oh, no. What is it? Hang on a second. Henry. Abigail. [Breathing heavily] Do you love me? Yes. Instead of just thinking about me and some... future heartbreak, I realize that  you're  here... now. Abigail : Yes. I'm here now. Wait. Just give him a second. I don't know what the future holds. But as long as I'm alive... I will always love you... Forever. Henry. We don't have to do this right now if you don't want to. [Sniffles, sighs] Remains of a Jane Doe, age 65 to 75. Cause of death... Fractured sternum. Impact to the steering column, resulting in internal hemorrhaging. [Sniffles] The cut to her lingual bone suggests that our victim's throat was cut when she was thrown through the windshield, resulting in massive blood loss. [Clears throat] You, uh, disagree with my assessment? I'm sorry, but, uh, with all due respect, it appears that the victim's ribcage is broken, by something small and soft... A hand, maybe. What are you saying? Well, the sheriff did say someone else was in the car with Abraham's mother. Maybe he tried to resuscitate her after the wreck. The break is consistent with chest compressions. He kidnapped her, forced her off the road. W-why would he save her? Because the cut to her throat was not made by the windshield. Look at the hyoid under magnification. I'm sorry, Henry, but the cut was made by... By a knife. Very good, Lucas. Well, I learned from the best. Which is why it's my professional opinion that, due to the angle of the cut, Abe's mother slit her own throat. What? Are you saying that she crashed, was ejected from the car, resuscitated, only to then take her own life? Why would somebody do that? To get away from someone. The man who showed up to Abigail's cottage and kidnapped her... It wasn't the judge, who confessed to the hit-and-run, and it wasn't the sheriff, who confessed to murdering Belinda. We've run out of suspects, Abe. Who else played a part on that night? Other than the man that Teddy ran down out on the road? The motorcyclist? Yes. He's the common denominator. He's the one that ties everyone together. Everything that happened on the night of April 7, 1985, is predicated on  him. Who was he? "Ruptured spleen, fractured skull, internal bleeding"... These are your mother's notes. She was a damn fine nurse, but nothing could have saved  this  man. So, where's his death certificate? Maybe it got lost. On Abigail's watch? Not likely. She approximated the unknown patient to be in his 30s. Described the John Doe as having dark hair. What is it, Henry? [Gasps] I need a moment alone, Abe. What's wrong, pops? A moment! Please. [Ringing] [Click] Adam : Hello, Henry. I suppose this means you've finally figured it out. You  killed her. You killed Abigail, you son of a bitch. If you want to know what really happened that night, let me start at the beginning. [Tires screech] As you know, I was struck while riding a motorcycle. Fate intervened. A very kind and skilled nurse saved my life. We're going to fix you up, you hear? When she came to check on me later, I made a very strange request. [Monitor beeping] Kill me. I'm sorry. What was that? Kill me. No, you don't understand. You're going to be fine. When I told her my story... that I was an immortal... And would come back to life without a scratch on my body, the nurse did a very strange thing. She believed you. Because she'd already heard it from  you. Nurse Blake. Mind helping me? That's when I knew what I had to do to find you, Henry. [Paddles whine] When she saw that I was gone, she understood. She didn't want me to find you. Abigail thought that I meant you harm. [Pounding on door] Who is he? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not the first immortal that you've met. I want his name. I have lived a long life, experienced pain like you would never imagine. Is everything okay? Perhaps I should start on  her. Everything's fine, dear. I, uh, I was just going to give this gentleman a ride. Adam : She thought that she was saving the girl's life. But there was another killer... A young deputy lurking in the shadows. And now you know the whole story. How did she die? She drove off the road. [Tires screech] I know you must think that I'm a monster, Henry. But I tried to save her. ♪ Adding scars to my heart ♪ Oh, you can't do this. You can't die! I have to know who he is. [Gasps] For 2,000 years, I thought I was alone. You  are  alone. No! No! What have you... What have you've done?! No! No!! Oh, what have you done?! No!! 30 years she set me back. But eventually, I found you... On my own. She died trying to protect me. What can I say, Henry? A good woman is hard to find. ♪ So let's love full and let's love loud ♪ 
♪ let's love now ♪ 
♪ 'cause soon enough, we'll die ♪
