 [Camera shatters] 
 Henry : We've been robbed! 
 There. 
 The Tang Dynasty horse. See? 
 It was right there! 
 Are you sure you haven't misplaced it? 
 I resent the implication. My memory is like a steel trap. 
 Unbelievable. 
 What kind of a monster would steal from a defenseless, old man? 
 Well, I would hardly call you old. 
 Me? No, I was talking about  you. 
 All right, look, go ahead. Do your thing. 
 Yeah, your "powers of observation" thing, whatever you call it. 
 Find out who stole that horse! 
 [Sighs] 
 Very well. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's a narrow space, indicating a suspect of at least average build and coordination. 
 From the lack of smearing in the dust, the suspect lifted the horse straight up, suggesting strength and youth. 
 We are seeking a person of average build, possibly right-handed, and over 4 1/2 feet tall. 
 Oh, that really narrows it down. 
 Henry, this is a... this is a major case. 
 Abraham, please. 
 A major case involves losses of at least $100,000. 
 We'd be lucky if your alleged Tang horse was worth a tenth of that. 
 "Alleged"? W-what are you saying? 
 You think it's fake? 
 It's always seemed a bit shiny to me. 
 Now, if anything else goes missing... 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll call the police. 
 Huh. Some Sherlock. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 [Panting] 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 [Engine revs] 
 [Tires squeal] 
 Henry :  It is often when one least expects it that fate arrives at our door. 
 We can't foresee it any more than we can escape it. 
 No matter how hard we run or hide, fate, like death, will always find us. [Thunder rumbles] [Sirens wailing, police radio chatter] Hey! Hi. Thank you. Look at you. You're awful chipper for a Monday. Well, I walked here. I stopped at my local bakery for some coffee. I feel bad saying this, but it's kind of nice when a crime scene happens down the street from your house. This your neighborhood? Mm-hmm. Pretty nice. Washington Heights isn't what I pictured for you. And what exactly did you picture? Um,  less  nice? Yeah, well, Sean liked  very  nice, so we settled on  pretty  nice, and I haven't moved. Now, on the subject of  "not  so nice." Vic was probably in the crosswalk. We got skid marks back here. Guessing driver sees him too late, and bam. Got a name? Not yet. We're pulling his prints. Looks to me like a gardenvariety hit-and-run. Hit, definitely. Run, probably. But hardly garden-variety. Only the fracture of the rear left tib-fib is at bumper level. He was struck from behind. And these tire marks aren't from a deceleration. They're from a rapid swerve towards our victim. He was running. He was trying to flee. Yes. He was struck by the bush, where his hat was knocked off. But if he's running that way and hit there, how does he end up  here? They reversed. They backed over him to finish the job. This wasn't a hit-and-run. This was murder. Well, Jo, there goes the neighborhood. Lucas : Come on. Come to daddy. Got it. Yes, get that paint fleck to the lab right away, Lucas. Hey, looks like our murder weapon might be a red car. Candy-apple red or maybe cherry. I don't know. What do you think? I'm getting a hint of Chestnut in there. Red. Red. Okay. Fine. For  some  of us, God is in the details. Hey. Hey. So, what do we have on the vic? His body was shattered by the car, but it had been broken long before. He lived a violent life. How can you tell that? Well, these scars... Stabbed twice, shot once. Healed fractures indicate he suffered beatings. I'm guessing his relationship with authority was very poor. Two shoulder displacements... Likely where the police jerked his arms behind him. Scars and fractures at the wrists from where he resisted while wearing metal restraints. Yes, his fingerprints will be on file, along with what I can assume is a long rap sheet. Ran the vic's prints. Bingo. Aaron Brown, 28 years old. This guy's got a long rap sheet. Assault, theft, B&E, caught three years for armed robbery. I mean, this kid was on parole when he died. Oh, wow. Charming guy. Yeah. Maybe check the D.A.'s office, see what the prosecutor has on file? Um... Yeah, I-I'm... I... I'll go call the guy. Damn. D.A. who put Aaron in jail three years ago... Sean Moore. Jo's late husband. Prosecutor was Sean Moore. Jo Martinez, homicide. Right. Okay. Thank you. Hey. Uh. D.A.'s office is sending over everything they have on Aaron Brown from three years ago, but we're not the only ones interested. Major Case Squad found his DNA at a jewelry-store robbery the night he was killed. Look, Jo, I'm sorry I gave you that file. Didn't even think about it being Sean's case. No, honestly, it's fine. Okay. 'Cause, you know, if you ever need a, like, uh... Need a what? Uh, someone, you know, uh, to listen or talk to, you know? I... Oh, God. Not very good at this kind of thing. No, you are not, but I appreciate it. Honestly... Mike, I'm good. [Voice breaking] That's him. That's my husband. He was supposed to take our son, Jerome, to the zoo this morning. Do you know if anyone would've wanted to harm your husband? No. He was a family man. He did have a record. From years ago. But he paid his debt. He got mixed up with some bad people, made some terrible decisions, but that was behind him. Do you know if your husband kept in touch with any of his old associates? No. I told you... Aaron had changed. He was excited because someone had called about a job opportunity... Did that job have anything to do with, uh, jewelry? I know what you're doing. Maybe you  think you know my husband  from your file or whatever, but I know him. Jail or no jail, he was the best man I knew, the best father. You need to find out who did this to him. These guys lie to the ones who love them the most. You don't believe he was a changed man? He told his wife someone wanted to see him about a job. Robbing a jewelry store? And then planned to take his son to the zoo hours after the heist. Major Case Squad found Brown's hair at the crime scene. Well, perhaps we should have a look. Henry. I get it. I want Aaron to be a good guy. I-I want the world to be that kind of place. But I've been a cop long enough to know criminals do not change their stripes. [Indistinct shouting] Calm yourself, young man. You were transferred from the asylum. If you've come to save me, Father, you're too late. Only God can truly save. I help with the small things. [Exhales heavily] Thank you. Would I be wrong to take you, sir, as a gentleman? I  was  a gentleman. But now, here... I don't know what I am. Share your burden... Whatever's weighing on you. You wouldn't believe me, even if I told you. I'm Catholic. We believe even when we know we're wrong. Still nothing? As you like it. [Grunts] It'll do you good to talk. Only way to heal your pain. And we have all the time in the world. Phil : Just another thieving parasite. Without the thieving parasites, I'd be out of a job, Mr. Fleishman. Glad to keep you gainfully employed, detective. Better go call my insurance agent. [Tone rings] Can't imagine what my premiums are gonna be. Of all the crime scenes in all the towns, she had to walk into  mine. I'd love to say it's a social call, but I'm afraid we think that your suspect is our victim in a homicide. Um, Dr. Henry Morgan, Detective Hank Dunn. Henry is our medical examiner. Dunn and I went to the Academy together. Old classmates? Mm. I used to let her cheat off me. I felt bad. She was falling behind. That's not exactly how I remember it. Have a look around. Mi  crime scene  es su  crime scene. So? See anything interesting? Apart from Detective Hank Dunn's interest in you? Dunn? Are you kidding? It'd be like dating my brother. Well, he ran his fingers through his hair twice when he first saw you... Preening. Touched your arm when he left. Are we here to talk about boys, or do you see anything useful? So... He started here. We got it all on the security tape, if you just want to watch that. I see it better doing it  this  way. He has a process. He went to work  here... Gloves, hammer. Aaron Brown is left-handed, so... Smash, grab. Smash, grab. Yes, left that one... Just turquoise costume stuff. How does he get all this? I have no idea. But it's kind of fun. Arriving here. Smash, remove panel, take out the lockbox. Smash the lockbox. $3.4 million in loose diamonds. Which he takes before making his escape, stopping first to smash down the security camera. Basically correct? Yeah, I mean, it took him a few whacks to break the glass, but otherwise, yeah. Aaron Brown didn't rob this store. Is this part of the fun? No, let me explain. Aaron Brown is left-handed. Yeah, and if you'll check the video, doc, you'll see that he used his left hand to smash the cases. Yes, but not very deftly, not as if it was his dominant arm. You said yourself that it took him several tries to break the glass. Perhaps the thief was  pretending to be left-handed. Additionally, Aaron Brown had a complete tear of his right anterior deltoid from when the cops threw him to the ground with his arms behind his back. His condition would have made this gesture impossible. There's no way he could have knocked down the security camera. I'm cheating, of course. It's right there on the videotape. Our victim cannot be your thief. I know I'm just homicide, but isn't it a bit odd for the criminal to smash down the camera  after  the crime? That's because he  wanted  us to see it. Thank you, detective. Did the guy who does your autopsies just blow up my case? Mm. I think so. He does that a lot. Lucas : So, the CSI guys found this mask in a garbage can a few blocks away from the jewelry store. Can you imagine that job, just sifting through trash all day? Lucas, you deposit internal organs in formaldehyde. Yeah, but I'm used to death, you know? It's the unknown stenches of  life  that freak me out, [sniffing] Like... ugh... like old diapers or leftover Indian food. Bleccch! Lucas, smell this. [Sniffs] Oh. That's actually nice. What is that... Pancakes? Yes! Lucas, we've got it. Which... uh, you got it. Yeah. What... what do we got? [Thud] Thank you. What do you got there? [Sighs] Everything the D.A.'s office had on the heist Aaron Brown went down for three years ago... Files, interviews, the works. You thinking if he was framed, it was an accomplice on a previous job? Well, it could be. We find out who robbed the jewelry store, maybe we find out who killed him. I'll take a crack at these. Uh, wait. What are you doing? I'm just helping out, Jo. With paperwork? Since when? Jo... These are Sean's files, maybe depositions, who knows what else. I'm not a wounded puppy, Mike. I can handle this. Sean :  People vs. Aaron Brown, deposition, December 3, 2010. This is prosecuting attorney Sean Moore. Let's start with, how much did you get for the diamonds? That I saw? 10 grand. Do you still have the cash? No. My girl's having our baby, so, you know, there's been expenses... crib, new clothes. You a married man? I am. Family men shouldn't be robbing jewelry stores, Aaron. [ Chuckles ] Yeah, well, maybe my son will learn from my mistakes, huh? Will I be able to see my girl again before the trial? I'll see what I can do. Time's up. [ Buzzer ] [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Cellphone beeps ] Hey, sweetie. I was just talking about you. [ Chuckling ]  No. Only good things. Henry : Jo, Detective Hanson. Is that... Yep. [Whirring] [Whirring stops] [Exhales sharply] We can put robots on Mars, but I can't keep the gum from getting stuck on that thing. Must be hard. I mean, not the gum. Seeing him. Feels like it's real for a moment, like you can talk to him. No, I just... [Breathing shakily] I just got caught off guard for a second. That's understandable. As it is that you want to keep it buried... And that you would like me to mind my own business. You have excellent powers of deduction, Henry. What is it you came up here for? I was wondering if you could smell some perspiration for me. [Chuckles] Henry, you always know just what to say. So, explain this to me. That [Sniffs] maple-syrupy pancake smell on a mask is... Was excreted by whoever wore it. You see, that's the symptom of untreated diabetes. Now, if we can find an associate of Aaron's... With diabetes, maybe he was the one who robbed the store? So we got to get medical records on every known associate. Ah. That won't be necessary. This gentleman will suffice. Look at the darkness around his skin folds... Acanthosis nigricans, a symptom of diabetes. Name's Diego Rodriguez. But sorry, doc... can't be him. Rap sheet says he was Aaron Brown's accomplice three years ago. But he went away for that, Jo... 15 years. Got to be at least a dime left on that. I'll check into it. Diego Rodriguez was paroled last month... good behavior. Nice job, detectives. How'd you finger Rodriguez for this? [Clears throat] The doc smelled his sweat. Interesting police work. Well, I trust Henry's nose over evidence any day. Fair enough. Let's go grab him. His parole officer gave us his last known address. It's a warehouse in Queens. Guns and badges only, doc. Yes, of course. Detective. Look after her, will you? NYPD! Hank : Diego Rodriguez, you're under arrest! Hey! Hey! [Clank] [Gunshot] Aah! Mike? Got an officer down. [Gunshots] Hank: Police, Diego! Diego : What the hell, man? [Gunshots] You okay? Yeah. Looks like it went through and through. [Whimpers] Hurts like a bitch. You better call your M.E. Why? Suspect is down. He's dead. [Groans] Cause of death? Rather straightforward. Diego Rodriguez died almost instantly when Detective Dunn's bullet obliterated his heart. Any word from Jo on Hanson? Yeah, he's out of surgery. He's gonna be fine. It's a flesh wound. [Sighs] That's a terribly vague description... "Flesh wound." I mean,  every  wound's a flesh wound. [Chuckling] Well, it's just a saying, doc. It's... Is that a diamond? [Exhales sharply] Diamonds. Whoa. It appears Mr. Rodriguez swallowed a condom full of stones. It must have burst when the second bullet struck him. They must be from the robbery. Well, only an expert in gemology could say that. And the one that consults for the NYPD only works 9 to 5. Luckily, for us, we have the next best thing. I got one word to describe these stones... "Meh." "Meh"? But the police were told that these diamonds were top-of-the-line. Well, in Jersey, sure, but with that clarity and that color, they're an S-12 at best. This case doesn't make sense. Why would Diego plan such an elaborate robbery only to steal worthless diamonds? I'm missing something. Look, before you pace yourself right out of here, I need you to turn your attention to a more pressing police matter. Excuse me? The Tang Dynasty horse. Who stole it? A customer? I don't think so. A delivery person? Maybe, but I usually chat them up. Then I remembered... There was this Asian kid, all tatted up, with a low hat and a backpack. Came in here twice. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're profiling this young man, Abraham. You realize that? Yeah, well, why would he be wearing a backpack? To carry books, his lunch... Anything. What about the low hat? Well, it was a bit chilly out. Abraham, listen to yourself. You're making assumptions, not observations. When it comes to police matters, I go with my gut. It's never steered me wrong before. When has it steered you  right? Well, all right, let's... Let's make it a clean slate. Abraham, please, don't jump to conclusions. We both know people aren't always what they appear to be. Yeah, yeah. [Thunder rumbles] So, Diego framed Aaron for the robbery, then ran him down? He shoots me, Dunn kills him... That's two cases closed. That it? That's it. Okay. No. That's not it. I mean, entirely. The diamonds we found in Diego, they were of low clarity, full of occlusions. Why would Diego plan all this to steal worthless diamonds? Henry, Diego Rodriguez robbed that store. He swallowed the diamonds he stole, and he drove a red car. What more do you need? Well, that's another question. The red paint we found on Aaron's hand... The tests came back. It's not from car paint at all... Totally different chemical compound. Ah, geez. Jo, I think these pain meds are wearing off. Could you go call somebody, please? Yeah, sure. Thanks. [Door opens] Henry. Let it go. Let what go? The case. Every second Jo is on this one is a second more she's got to be thinking about her husband. It is eating her up. She would die if she heard us talking about this. Now, I'm asking you... Don't blow this case up, doc. Of course not. Henry : Lucas, we have to go it alone. Copy that. Just the two of us...  Mano a Mano ... Like the old days, huh? [Chuckles] Solving a crime. That never really happened. What are we doing here? Too many open questions in this case. If the paint found on Aaron Brown's knuckles wasn't from the car, and yet, based on the clotting, it was sustained just before he died, where did the paint come from? Huh. Well, fire hydrant, street curb, graffiti... No matches. Following the reverse trajectory of Aaron Brown's path takes us in  that  direction. Holly bushes. Hey, uh, per your notes, there was a drupe of ilex polypyrena on Aaron's pant leg, right? That's a holly berry. Yes, you're right. Our victim  was  here. Really? You're certain? Oh, very certain. Yes! I knew it! I've been working on my observation skills, you know? Just learning to see all the details all around me. And I set my scan on "red," and [Clicks tongue] ding! There it was... just red, right in front of me. [Chuckles] Just riding on instinct at this point... Oh. A red door. Well, keep up the good work. I was... I was gonna mention that next. This is the door. Aaron was here. 
 
 Hey. Henry? What are you doing here? This is  your  house? Yes. Why are you two here? We are here for a very legitimate, non-creepy reason that... Henry will now explain. We're working on the Aaron Brown murder. I believe he stopped here minutes before he was killed. Hold on. Somebody did knock on my door that night, but why would Aaron want to come see me? He didn't. He came to see your husband. What is this about? I have funeral arrangements to take care of. Mrs. Brown, we believe your husband came to Detective Martinez's house in Washington Heights the night he died. Actually, we believe he came there to see my husband, Sean Moore. Sean? He tried Aaron's case. You know my husband? When Aaron was arrested, he was looking at 20 years. But Sean believed Aaron when he said he wanted to change his life... Promised to do everything in his power to give my husband a second chance. He even spoke with the probation board. And he helped Aaron get his sentence reduced. So he could see his baby grow up. Your husband is a good man. He believed Aaron when no one else would. Hard to find that in this world. Do you believe me, Father? [Breathing heavily] Even though how crazy my story might be? We've been cellmates for three months, Henry. I know you're a man of your word. Yes, but do you  believe what I've said? Yes. I believe you. And as a man of the cloth, despite my many sins, I realize now that God chose you. I'm not a religious man. [Laughing] Ah, well, that has never stopped him before. This is a curse. No. Have you read your Bible? The more blessed you are, the worse it is. You're here for a reason, Henry... as am I. Well, yes... sleeping with the magistrate's wife. W-well, that was my sentence, but... it is not my story. I am here for a reason, and that reason is you. And I know how I can help you! Do not try and help me, Henry. Don't offer me advice or sympathy or any of your armchair analysis. Understood. Perhaps  one  tiny suggestion. Henry, I am armed. Little splash of water. Helps the rye to release its full bouquet. Thank you. Well, if you're gonna drink, you might as well do it properly. I meant for not talking about Sean. I knew what you meant. If you want to talk, I'm here. Otherwise, I'll just sit silently beside you. Silence isn't a gift that I was given. Jo. [Sighs] I've seen a lot of death, in all its forms... Coronary disease, gunshot wounds, blunt-force traumas, exsanguinations, strangulation... Henry, what is your point? What kills you is not what causes your heart to stop beating. It's what prevents you from living. You must deal with Sean's death someday. Not tonight. Okay? No. Not tonight. [Sighs] Good morning, sunshine. [Jo groans] My head... How did I get here? Well, after the bar closed, Abe picked us up. We thought we'd bring you here because you might need  this. My patented hangover remedy. Ugh. Don't ask. Just drink. [Whimpers] That is... Awful, but... I'm awake. Good. Jo, I-I-I need your expertise as a law-enforcement officer. I, uh, I'm sure that Henry told you about the robbery at our store. Uh... no. We must get going. Yeah, listen, this, uh, this young, tattooed miscreant stole a Tang Dynasty horse from the shop. Now, I have some ideas I just want to run past you. Do you have surveillance? These two eyes... That's it. Okay. How much was it insured for? Well, that's... hard to authenticate. Because it's a fake. The patina was ghastly. So, I suppose it's covered under the blanket policy. W-wai... With insurance, it might be more valuable stolen. What if... the stones were never meant to be found? Diego stole the right stones, but he had no idea they were worthless. Hey, I'm talking about a horse. What are  you  guys talking about? There's someone else... Someone who stood to benefit from cheap diamonds being stolen. We have to look at Sean's old case files again. Wait a minute. What about my horse? Phil Fleishman. Yeah, the owner of the jewelry store. We think he hired Diego Rodriguez to rip him off. Which explains why Diego only had the  cheap  diamonds in his belly. Yeah, Phil cashed out on the insurance money and kept the real stones. You're making me look bad, Jo. Relax. You don't have a Henry. No offense, doc, but I don't have  you. [Elevator bell dings] Well said. Let's go get him. Doc... Yes, guns and badges only. I know. Nice work. Let's take  my  car. It's very fast. Well, only if I can drive. Mm... Inform the mortuary we are done with Mr. Rodriguez. Mike : What happened? I heard Jo went on a collar. Yes... the jewelry store owner, Phil Fleishman. Shouldn't you be home, detective? Have you met my kids? I'm safer here, believe me. How's the arm? Hurts like a son of a bitch. I guess I'm lucky, though. A few more inches over, I could have been in here as a client. Yes. That  is  rather fortunate. Well, you seem all broken up about it, doc. That anxious to slice me up, huh? A shot from across the room, missing all vitals and bone in your tricep? Yeah, that's one in a million. Well, what can I say? I'm a lucky guy. What are you looking at me like this for? H-hey! What are you... What are you doing? Please take a seat. I need to examine your wound. Doc's orders. Lucas, can you please remove the bandage? Ouch! Sorry. Not used to working with the living. So, the after-incident report stated that Diego Rodriguez was in your 1:00 position when you were shot. Now, the bullet cut across your body and struck you here. So? Well, that just couldn't happen. Lucas. [Clears throat] Lucas, take your hand out from underneath. You look ridiculous. I believe Mr. Magnum, P.I., would disagree. So, your arm is outstretched, and the bullet entered  here... Inner to outer. You see, the angles are all wrong. Doc, the unis did a full sweep of the warehouse. There was no one else there. There  was  someone else... Someone who could have easily shot you and planted the gun on Diego. Detective Dunn? He's with Jo right now. The unis checked the shop. It's closed... No sign of Phil. But I did get an address for him in Westchester. Hold on. [Tires squeal] Whoo! I like your car, Dunn. Yeah. I can tell. Take the Henry Hudson. The house is in Dobbs Ferry. God. Can't believe I missed this guy. Only a thief can afford to live out there. The rest of us are left to make do with Washington Heights, right? No cop can afford to live in the city. [Beep] [Speed-dialing] All right, they're heading up the Henry Hudson. Let's put a bolo out on Dunn's car  now. [Cellphone ringing] Detective! [Ringing continues] [Cellphone beeps] Hello, Jo. Hey, Dunn, what was that address again? I think we're getting close. Detective Hanson! It's Jo. She's in the car, but she can't answer me. [Scoffs] What's the matter with you? I screwed up, didn't I? What are you talking about? Washington Heights. I wasn't supposed to know that. Why? My husband was an assistant district attorney, which means we kept our address secret. You followed Aaron to my door. [Tires squeal] And then you ran him down. [Engine revs] You don't need the gun. I know we're not going to Phil's. He's got a gun on her. So, what was your plan? Come on. You at least owe me that, right? I caught Phil pulling one of his insurance scams. But instead of putting him in jail, we made a plan. Diego would heist the store, Aaron would take the fall for the job, and Phil would cut me in on the insurance money. But then you made a mistake. Aaron saw me. He knew as soon as he walked in... Smelled the blue on me. He tried to run, but... But he couldn't outrun you. Not in  this  car. Take the next exit... Mosholu Parkway. Mike : Damn it... That's no-man's-land, and state police are still 10 minutes out. He is gonna kill her. We got to get her out of there. Priest : Have faith, Henry. My plan's gonna work. Trust me. I've done the calculations in my head. With a 2-foot drop, we have enough weight between us to break your neck. Your plan is for me to kill myself. My plan is for you to escape. This curse of yours is a blessing. No matter the prison, you are one death away from freedom. But when I'm gone, they'll think you helped me escape. You'll spend the rest of your life in this cell. No, I know you're not a believer, Henry, but this is not chance. I was sent here to save you. A-a-and one small request. When you're born anew, go somewhere far. Start over. Use this life, Henry Morgan. This blessing. [Sighs] I promise. All right. [Exhales sharply] Jo? Do you trust me? You need to crash your car into a barricade. You're crazy. Watch it, Jo. I do have a gun. Henry, what the hell?! I'm not crazy. I've seen enough car accidents to know that you'll survive. Just past the Mosholu Parkway exit, there is an emergency barricade. Keep the car at 60 miles an hour. But, Jo, you must aim for the center of the barricade. Do you know what you're doing? Right there. Get off. Trust me, Jo. [Engine revving] Jo! What are you doing?! Hit the middle of the barricade! I swear to God, doc, you better be right. Jo! I'm right with you, Jo! Trust me! [Revving continues] Stop! You're gonna kill us! [Static] Jo. [Static continues] Jo? [Siren wailing] Jo! Man : Detective Martinez, looks like you're gonna be okay. Jo! Henry. [Sighs] Well... [Sighs] Turns out you were right... as usual. [Sighs] [Bells jingle] [Door locks] [Dialing] Robbery in progress. Suffolk and Stanton. [Cellphone beeps] All right, halt! I called the cops. They're on their way. I'm not stealing this. Oh, yeah? Then what are you doing with it? And where's my horse? This vase belongs over there, with the other 16th century Parisian wares, not with this 19th century American crap. And the horse... fake. [Laughing] The patina was unbearable. I stuck it in there. Where did you learn your stuff? My mom was an art dealer in Hong Kong. But she died, and now I'm in New York with my uncle. I don't get to see things like this anymore... Things with history. You really called the cops? Mm... [Groans] Hey, hey, hey. Here. W-what are you doing here? I just thought I'd come finish up the Aaron Brown case. Have you looked in a mirror? Have  you? Well, Dunn's in medical holding with a concussion and, like, a hundred broken bones. This case is closed. Go home. Or you could come over for dinner. God knows, Karen would love to see you, and I will put the fear of God into those boys of mine if they give you the business. What do you say? Thank you. You're right. It's time for me to go home. Henry :  Fate can be cruel. A minute here, a minute there, and lives can be lost. [ Cellphone rings ] Sean :  Hey, sweetie. I was just talking about you. [ Chuckling ]  No. Only good things. Listen, I can't wait to see you tonight. Dinner at home? Watch a movie? That's perfect. I love you. Bye. [Audio rewinding] Listen, I can't wait to see you tonight. Dinner at home? Watch a movie? That's perfect. I love you. Bye. [Audio rewinding] Listen, I can't wait to see you tonight. Dinner at home? Watch a movie? That's perfect. I love you. Bye. [Tape rewinding] I love you. Bye. Henry :  But fate also gifts us moments of impossible grace... [Knock on door] Moments in time when we come together and connect in a way that is profound... Thought you might need some company. Chance occurrences so precious that they almost make one believe in the divine, that there is someone out there looking after us. Thank you... for coming over. Of course. You know... The day before Sean left for Washington... We got in this fight. It was a... it was a terrible fight. And he went off to bed, and I went for a walk around the block. Next morning, I left early for work. There was no way I was gonna apologize first. I don't even remember what the fight was about. But... The last thing I said to my husband... [Voice breaking] It was in anger. [Sighs] And I never... I never got the chance to just tell him I was sorry. [Sniffles] You were in love, Jo. He knew. Trust me... he knew.
