 You have earned the distinction of being the best trained, the most vibrant city in the world,  where every day brings a responsibility  to keep all New Yorkers safe--  safe from crime... and safe from terrorism. And though the city is on the very cutting edge of technology, nothing...  replaces your unwavering sense of right and wrong  and your eyes and ears on the street. And we remain safe because of the hard work and dedication of the men and women  of the New York City Police Department.

 Original Air Date on September 24, 2010 
 You okay in all this Pop? 
 I'm not an invalid. 
 I had a hip replacement. 
 Mr. Mayor. 
 Inspiring words, Frank. 
 Hey, Dave. 
 But we miss you up at the 64. 
 I don't miss you guys. 
 (laughs) 
 (horns honking, excited chattering) 
 HENRY: How the hell are you supposed to find anybody in this mess? 
 Dad! 
 Hey. Grandpa, over here! 
 Great speech, Dad. 
 Hi. Hey. 
 Hey, Grandpa. I'm proud of you, son. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You looked great up there. 
 Mom's probably spinning in her grave, you quitting the law and becoming a cop and all. 
 Danny. I'm just sayin'. 
 Golden boy was on the fast track to Washington. 
 Now look at him. 
 Just like the rest of us Reagans-- 
 another boot in a suit. 
 Don't must my chops, Danny. 
 Excuse me, all the Reagans? 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sis. 
 I forgot we got an assistant district attorney Thank you. in the family-- I'm so proud of you, sis. 
 We'd have another lawyer in the family if these two would set a date. What, and spoil all the fun? 
 Hey, Reagan, we made it. 
 Yeah! 
 Congratulations, boss. 
 Dad, this is Officer Romano. 
 First woman recruit to win the sharpshooter medal. 
 Well done. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I just wanted to say hello. 
 (chuckles) 
 You must be... 
 Sydney, right? 
 Congratulations. 
 Thanks. I'll see you around, Reagan. 
 Okay. 
 She won the sharpshooter medal. 
 Your father said. 
 Well, the gang's all here. 
 I guess we should be getting over to the Breslin. Oh, sorry, but first-year associates don't get lunch. 
 I'm lucky they let me out for this. 
 It was amazing. 
 Mmm. Okay. 
 Bye, everybody. Love you. 
 Bye. 
 Bye, Sidney. 
 She seems to be handling this well, you being a cop. 
 (phone rings) 
 We're working on it. 
 It can't be easy after watching you bury your brother. 
 Joe died doing what he loved to do. 
 Little brother, I'm gonna have to buy you a beer another time. 
 I got a missing kid. Got to go. 
 You up to catch a case? 
 Yeah, Dad. 
 Demarcus is on his way. 
 I'll see you guys later. 
 Bye. Bye, boys. 
 Bye. Bye. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Little girl-- I don't like the sound of it. 
 Your glass half empty much? 
 I mean, she could turn up at a friend's house. 
 Yeah, but, then, why'd they call us? 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Smile for the cameras, Danny boy. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 What do we got? 
 Nine-year-old female Hispanic, Teresa Campos, didn't come home from school, St. Anita up the block. 
 The mother there got worried, went looking for her, and the building super told her he saw a couple of young boys grab a pink backpack from the gutter here and run off with it. 
 Backpack hers? 
 You find the kids who found the backpack? 
 Not yet. I got Housing doing verticals in the projects, and aviation's en route to check rooftops. 
 Anybody see anything else? 
 This doll was found near where the backpack was. 
 One of those ones you press it and it talks. 
 DOLL: Change me. I'm wet. 
 Anyway, the mother said she never seen it before. 
 All right, voucher it and get prints and serology on it, okay? 
 Let's put out an AMBER Alert request, get a canvass going. 
 There's a lot of cameras around. 
 Check the surveillance video, clear out all the apartment Dumpsters, mailboxes, drains, sewers, everything-- just try not to let the family see what you're doing, okay? Gotcha. 
 You know that feeling you were getting? 
 Yeah. I'm getting it, too. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Campos, I'm Detective Reagan. 
 This is my partner, Detective King. 
 We understand your daughter went missing. 
 Um... I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions. 
 (sobbing) 
 She always comes home. 
 She comes home every day. 
 She knows her mother worries. 
 She's a good girl. 
 I'm sure she is-- I know how difficult this must be for you. 
 DANNY: Is it possible she may have run away? 
 Maybe you had a fight, maybe an ex-husband may have taken her. 
 Rigo's her father. 
 There was no fight. 
 Where is she? You have to find her. 
 The more you can tell us, Mrs. Campos, the more we can help. 
 OFFICER: Detective, can I talk to you? Excuse me. 
 Woman there saw a white van pull away from the curb here really crazy. 
 White van in New York City? That narrows it down. 
 Yeah, I know-- she didn't get the plates, either, but she said it had a cracked rear window. 
 All right, let's put the van out on the wire, notify bridge and tunnel security-- maybe we'll get lucky. 
 DOLL: Change me. I'm wet. 
 I'm thinking this isn't a simple custodial dispute, partner. 
 Yeah. Doesn't smell like a ransom case, either. 
 Yeah, but we got another problem. 
 Little girl's a diabetic. 
 She gets insulin shots every 24 hours. 
 So if she doesn't get 'em... 
 My baby... 
 Please! You have to find her! 
 We'll do all we can. 
 We'll do all we can. 
 We'll do all we can, ma'am. 
 (sobbing) 
 It's all right, it's all right. 
 Oh, my baby! It's all right. 
 (sobbing): Help... 
 REPORTERS: Commissioner Reagan! Commissioner Reagan! 
 Commissioner Reagan! Commissioner! 
 All right, before I take questions... 
 As you all know, the first hours are crucial in a case like this, so I'm asking for the media's help in keeping Teresa's face before the public. 
 Our task force will respond to each and every lead, and I assure you the New York City Police Department will not rest till we find this little girl. 
 (reporters shouting questions) 
 Miguel. 
 Commissioner Reagan, what do you say to blog allegations there's a third fewer police than on the Allie Dintenfass AMBER Alert on the Upper East Side last summer? 
 Miguel, you're a professional journalist. 
 Do you really want to give credence to any amateur blogger with a laptop? 
 Then what is your response to polls that show an endemic lack of faith in police by the Latino community and a slow and steady rise in crime there? 
 I don't respond to polls, Miss Davidson. 
 But since I've been on the job, crime is down across the board. 
 So you're claiming that the mayor's budgetary cutbacks aren't affecting the department's ability to keep all citizens of this city safe? 
 None of us is concerned about cost today. 
 A nine-year-old girl is missing, and the clock is ticking. 
 We need to find Teresa. 
 Just make sure you media people do your job and keep her face before the public. 
 Next question. 
 (reporters shouting questions) 
 Tony. 
 (computers trilling) 
 DANNY: What a world. 
 16. 16 registered s*x offenders within a five-block radius of this girl's home. 
 What have you got for me, partner? 
 Tip on a white van with a little girl in Astoria, but it was just an Asian family. 
 All right, it's going to be a long night. 
 Let's get to work. 
 Hey, caught your news conference on the kidnap, Frank. 
 It was a nice job. 
 Come in. 
 You know, Frank, we got to find this kid. 
 Alive. 
 We're doing everything we can, Mr. Mayor. 
 That better be enough. 
 I hear your boy is lead detective? 
 If you're talking about Detective First Grade Daniel Reagan, I heard that, too. 
 You think that's wise, Frank? 
 Could be exposing yourself to all kinds of scrutiny if it goes south. 
 You're popular with the public, but I don't have to tell you, you don't have a lot of friends in high places to back you up. 
 I don't spend a lot of time worrying about that. 
 Well, maybe you should. 
 Oh, yeah, and another thing. 
 The attitude with the press and that little sound bite about how since you've been chief and the crime stats decreasing. 
 There is no future in that kind of grandstanding. 
 Just ask your old man. 
 (phone rings) 
 Reagan. 
 FRANK: It occurred to me that with all you've got on your plate, you might not have time to drop off the roast for Sunday dinner. 
 You calling about the roast, or are you looking for an update, Dad? 
 Well, speaking as your boss, I hope you know you have all the resources you need. 
 Well, I appreciate that, boss. 
 I'll keep you posted. 
 Ay, ay, ay. 
 What's up, Reagan? 
 Motivational call from my old man. 
 What about you? 
 Yeah. 
 It's not great news. 
 RTCC's data mine of our girl's neighborhood? 
 The sketchy-ass uncle's been locked up on Rikers Island for DWI. 
 You know, I had such high hopes for that man. 
 I just keep thinking about that girl. 
 Imagine how afraid she is, how afraid her family is. 
 (sighs) 
 Where's the doll? 
 We need the doll. 
 Why? The lab didn't pull anything from it. No DNA. 
 No prints. Yeah, but that's just it. 
 I mean, if the doll belonged to another girl, then why is it so clean? 
 I mean, there's no prints, no DNA, no nothing. Why? 
 Well, 'cause maybe... maybe they wore gloves. 
 And they used it as bait to lure the girl in. 
 Exactly. All right, there's got to be a label or a stamp or something on the doll. Let's find out who makes it, where they sell it. 
 Maybe this talking doll can tell us something. 
 All right. 
 Give me the Evidence Room. 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 Had to be China, right? 
 They're trying to find someone who speaks English. 
 What is it over there, tomorrow or yesterday? 
 Yes. Hello. 
 Yeah, this is Detective Reagan, New York Police. 
 Yeah, your Dolly Change Me doll-- 
 I need to know where it's sold in the Eastern United States. 
 You what? 
 Are you sure? 
 Okay. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 I need you to give me the names and addresses of anyone who had access to one of these dolls. 
 No, no, no. No call back. 
 I don't have time for you to call back. 
 You put me on hold, I'll wait. 
 What's going on? 
 The doll-- it's a... it's a prototype. 
 It's not even for sale yet. They made it for test marketing. 
 Three. 
 Three people. 
 Only three people have these dolls. 
 What are their names? 
 The haystack just got a little smaller. 
 Morning, Lou. 
 Jim, I'll need to talk to the chief at Manhattan South. 
 I've got a call in to see if there's any progress on the kidnapping case. 
 There's nothing solid yet. 
 They're working on a new lead. 
 DANNY: Yeah. All right. 
 Yeah. 
 They found one of the three sample dolls. 
 Belongs to a UN delegate who's over in Shanghai. 
 She's still over there with the doll. 
 And doll number two is supposed to be in this dump? 
 Rats in Staten Island live better than this. 
 Oh. 
 (loud rock music plays) 
 MAN: Who's there? 
 Police. Open the door. 
 You Oliver Peele? 
 Yeah. 
 We need to come inside. 
 Why? What's going on? 
 Step inside. 
 (loud music plays) 
 What is this place? OLIVER: What? 
 Mind turning down the music? 
 (turns down music) 
 Man, this is crazy. 
 Hey, little girl... Hey! 
 Little girl went missing yesterday afternoon. 
 Where were you? 
 OLIVER: Here probably. 
 DANNY: You got anybody to verify that? 
 DEMARCUS: Wait a minute. 
 Hey, Reagan? 
 DOLL: Change me. The sample. 
 I'm wet. He has his. It's not him. 
 Hey, you can't take that. I'm not done with it yet. 
 Be my guest. 
 Let's go. 
 Aren't you a little old to be playing with dolls? 
 I'm a reviewer for  World of Dolls Magazine? 
 Oh. 
 I know what you're thinking, but mothers rely on me. 
 (phone rings) 
 Reagan. We found it? 
 Hey, doll number three. 
 Toy salesman named Donald Banse. 
 No, that's great. Put it out there. Yeah. 
 What'd they get? 
 He's got a Florida driver's license, so we got prints and his picture now. 
 Any local address? 
 His wife's got a New York driver's license with an address right in our own backyard. 
 Should I radio in, let 'em know we're back in service? 
 Could you give me a minute to drink my coffee, kid? 
 You know, I was also your brother Joe's training officer when he was a new boot? 
 No kidding? No, I didn't know that. 
 Yeah. 
 Terrible thing, he got shot. 
 He was a good guy, your brother. 
 Yeah, he was. 
 Good guy. 
 So, I hear you went to Harvard. 
 What are you doing on the beat? 
 Trying to see how the real people live? 
 Writing a book? 
 It's in the blood, I suppose. 
 Well, Harvard, that's something we're gonna have to find out. 
 Don't think just 'cause your old man is the boss, I'm going to be cutting you any slack. 
 You're going to have to earn it just like everybody else. 
 Yeah. Yeah, Joe was a sweetheart. 
 Now, your brother Danny, on the other hand... 
 Danny's Danny. 
 Hey, Harvard, I got the last word. 
 Okay? Yeah. 
 DISPATCHER: 31 George, reports of a female calling for help, West 4-5. 
 That's us. 
 Seems to be in distress... 
 What are you looking at me for? 
 Get in the car! Go ahead. 
 I'm not seeing a white van. 
 Mildred Banse? 
 Yeah. 
 Can I help you? 
 We need to talk to your husband. Is he home? 
 No. No. Why? 
 What's he done? 
 We just need to talk to him, that's all. 
 Do you mind if we look inside? 
 I'm telling you, I haven't seen him in months. 
 I'm-I'm divorcing the b*st*rd. 
 I just sent him the last box of his stuff. 
 Oh, yeah? Where? 
 Inwood. The Lincoln Arms. 
 But I don't know if he's still there. 
 How much longer we got with this diabetes thing? Couple hours? 
 If that. Teresa's type 1 diabetes. 
 She could die of insulin shock. 
 Right up here. Right ahead on the right. 
 Lincoln Arms Hotel. Right there. 
 No white van. Blue van. 
 Yeah? 
 Maybe white van, blue paint job. 
 There's something inside. 
 Yeah, and he fixed the crack in the window. 
 Gonna have to fix this one, too. 
 She's not here. 
 What's this? 
 A communion dress. 
 Votive candles. The good news is, he didn't light 'em yet. Let's check inside. 
 Close it up. 
 Police. Open up. 
 Donald Banse? Yes, I am. 
 How can I help you? Hey. We're coming inside. 
 Hey. Step aside. 
 He's packing his bags. You going somewhere? 
 Hey, where's the little girl? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Yeah, you do. When you snatched her off the street, you dropped your sample doll in the gutter. 
 Now, where is she? 
 A doll was stolen from my van. 
 I was gonna give it to my niece for her first communion. 
 Oh, you mean the van that you had painted blue and changed the cracked window on? 
 You know what? I don't even have to talk to you. 
 I know my rights. Don't talk to us then. 
 BANSE: What are you doing? 
 Up against the wall. Are you arresting me? 
 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law... 
 Fine, fine. Good. Take me downtown. 
 My lawyer will have me out in an hour. 
 Then maybe I will see my little niece. 
 Oh! 
 What did you say? 
 (laughs) 
 
 
 
 DEMARCUS: Hey, hey, hey, come on. 
 Come here. Come here. Get off me! 
 Danny, let's take him downtown. 
 Oh, get off me! Oh! Let's take him downtown. 
 Go outside and call it in. 
 Reagan, let's take him downtown. 
 We don't have time. The girl needs insulin. 
 Go outside and call it in! 
 Hey, you gonna tell me where she is? 
 Huh? All right, get in there. 
 (water bubbling) 
 Get in there! 
 (gasping) 
 Where is she? 
 (gasping) 
 Go to hell. 
 You first. 
 (toilet flushing) 
 (water bubbling) 
 I'm gonna give you one last chance to tell me where she is. 
 Right now. I don't know. 
 No? No? 
 (choking) 
 You ready to talk now? Huh?! Huh?! 
 (siren wailing) 
 This storage locker we're going to, the name he rented it under-- 
 Monsignor Nicholas, patron saint of kids. 
 BANSE: Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry Hey, shut up you! for having offended thee... 
 Hey, just shut your mouth! 
 (siren wailing) 
 (siren stops) 
 (siren approaching) 
 (siren wails) 
 You better hope she's still alive. 
 Teresa? 
 Teresa? 
 Hey. 
 Teresa, wake up. Wake up. 
 (gasps) 
 No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. 
 You're safe now. 
 I'm a police officer, okay? 
 I'm going to get you home, all right? 
 Let me put this on you, all right? 
 Here we go. 
 I'm going to take this off really quick, okay? 
 It's going to hurt a little bit, but hold on. 
 (groans) 
 Okay. All right. You're going to come with me now. 
 Come on. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 Where's my mama? 
 You're going to see her real soon. 
 Come on! Where's my mama? 
 It's okay. Listen. These are doctors. 
 They're going to take you to the hospital, and your mama and papa are going to be there waiting for you, okay? 
 She needs insulin right away. 
 Hey. We won one. 
 Yeah, we did. Doesn't get much better than that. 
 Police brutality! 
 He tried to drown me. 
 This officer right here tried to drown me. 
 He shoved my head in a toilet! 
 Mr. Adelman,  you have emergency motions to bring in this case? 
 Your Honor, we will be filing a Huntley motion, that any statement my client made or any physical evidence obtained was done so through the use of excessive force. 
 Specifically, an officer waterboarded my client. 
 In a toilet. 
 That's a serious allegation. 
 I have photographs taken at the time of the arrest, Your Honor. 
 Your Honor, the officer contends that the accused was resisting arrest. 
 He looks pretty banged up to me. 
 Your Honor, since all of the State's evidence is clearly inadmissible, our final motion is that the case be dismissed, and Mr. Banse be released from custody immediately. 
 You make a compelling case, Mr. Adelman. 
 No, Your Honor! 
 The accused confessed to kidnapping the girl, and led us to where he had her imprisoned. 
 Ms. Boyle, as heinous as I find the accused's actions, you know the law as well as I do. 
 Any confession illegally coerced is inadmissible, and with no admissible evidence, we have no basis to hold him. 
 The State pleads for more time, Your Honor. 
 Your Honor... 
 We don't want this individual on the street. 
 But at the same time, an officer seems to have taken the law into his own hands, which we cannot abide. 
 We are looking at the weekend. 
 I'm going to schedule a hearing on this case for Monday afternoon. 
 If the State cannot marshal some admissible evidence to indict by then, I will have no choice but to let the accused go. 
 Hey. What happened? 
 What happened? 
 It's a disaster, that's what happened. 
 Stop with the dramatics, and just tell me. 
 What did you think you were doing? 
 What do you mean, what I was doing? 
 I was saving a little girl's life. 
 What, so this pervert can go prey on some other girl? 
 He's probably going to walk because you trashed all the evidence. 
 We didn't trash the evidence. 
 Oh. 
 We got the van in custody. CSU's all over it for DNA and fibers. 
 Yeah, well you better hope they find something, or you find something. 
 You have till Monday. 
 What do you mean, I only got until Monday? 
 Monday. Because that's when they're going to let the scumbag go. You crossed the line, Danny. 
 Get off my case. 
 Oh, I'll be getting off your case. 
 You're my brother. I'll have to recuse myself if this goes to trial, but that's a really big "if," 
 isn't it? 
 (brakes squeal) 
 Anybody home? 
 (door opens and closes) 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Hey. 
 I got the meat here from Eddie's for tomorrow. 
 Linda says you should probably take it out about two hours before you go to mass. 
 I guess you heard. 
 Not the best news. 
 No. CSU scoured the van. 
 No fibers, not a single hair. 
 Guess I screwed up, huh? 
 Internal Affairs is going to have to get into this. 
 Just so you know, Demarcus had nothing to do with it. 
 I told him to call it in. 
 This whole thing will go down a lot easier if you nail this guy. 
 I know that, Dad, but I got nothing. 
 Guy had a ritual. 
 Yeah, I mean, he had the candles, the dress, the communion thing, but that's it. 
 Well... maybe you should run it through VICAP, see if there's any cold cases with the same M.O.? 
 Just 'cause the guy doesn't have a record doesn't mean he didn't do it. 
 Right. 
 'Cause you don't just wake up one day at 50 
 and become a pervert. 
 That's a welcome relief. 
 Thanks, Chief. 
 Danny, you ever see that doctor? 
 Well, you know, I've been busy, Dad. 
 There's no shame talking about what went on in Iraq. 
 I'll get around to it. 
 Don't forget about the meat. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 (people talking indistinctly, laughing) 
 Whitney, tell them where you've been. 
 She's-she's been in Alberta, working on a takeover of a Canadian shale oil outfit. 
 Jamie's the one with the exciting new gig, though, right? 
 Yeah, how was life on the mean streets today, Jaimer? 
 A guy pushed his boy down a flight of stairs. 
 Kid's paralyzed. 
 There's some bad people out there. 
 I need a cigarette. 
 Excuse me, guys. 
 Syd! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know this isn't easy for you, Syd. 
 What did your mother call it, my little bait and switch? 
 You fall for a Harvard lawyer and you end up with a cop on the beat. 
 It isn't about the status or the money or any of that stuff. 
 I was cheering my head off for you at graduation along with everybody else. Just... 
 Afterwards, I started thinking about your brother Joe. 
 The reality finally hit me that you're going to be out there every day. 
 It's where I want to be. 
 Really, I always wanted to be a cop. 
 Hey, we're going to be okay. 
 (chuckles) 
 Okay? 
 (laughs) 
 We better get back in. 
 Yeah. 
 Most of these kidnaps are custodial. 
 Hmm. 
 (keys click, computer beeps) 
 Hold on. I got something. 
 Cold case. Tampa, Florida. 
 Catholic girl right around Teresa's age went missing. 
 Body never found. 
 When Banse was living there? 
 What a coincidence. 
 All right. You keep looking for open cases. 
 I'm going to call down to Tampa, try to get police records and news coverage. 
 There's got to be something that we can find to tie the guy to this crime. 
 (bell tolls) 
 How many times have we set this table together? 
 A million. 
 I remember the first time we didn't set a place for Grandma. 
 Yeah, I know. I miss her, too. 
 I wish you had met my Grandma Rose. 
 She was such a riot. 
 This is her china, you know. 
 Where is everybody? 
 That roast is not going to wait. 
 Boys! Guys! Dinner! 
 ERIN: I better get those rolls before they're incinerated. 
 HENRY: Sit next to me at this end of the table. 
 Okay. 
 FRANK: Hey, I'm good to go. 
 Something smells awfully good, and it ain't this pip-squeak. 
 Hey! 
 SEAN: Grandpa, can I sit next to you, please? 
 Sure, squirt. 
 Staten Island isn't the other side of the world. 
 It wouldn't kill you to come to our house one Sunday. 
 Hey, all! 
 Hey, Jamie. Hey. 
 FRANK: Here he is. 
 LINDA: Finally. 
 Where's your girl? 
 Greenwich with her folks. 
 More for us then. 
 Hey, where's Danny? 
 He said he would try to make it. 
 ERIN: You all know, right? 
 I'd like to strangle him. 
 No strangling on Sunday, okay, sunshine? 
 Okay, Pops. 
 Danny did what he had to do. 
 Well, I knew you would take his side. 
 I say what I think. 
 Yeah, and look where it got you. 
 Jamie? 
 Bless us, O Lord, for these gifts which we are about to receive from your bountiful hands through Christ our Lord. Amen. 
 ALL: Amen. 
 DANNY: Real food. 
 I don't want any beans. 
 Yes, you do. 
 HENRY: I'll tell you where it got me. 
 I got a clean conscience, and I can sleep at night. 
 Where what got you? 
 Mom's mad at him because he took your side. 
 Okay, Nicky. Stay out of it, please. 
 Oh, your mom's riding around on her high horse, huh? 
 ERIN: Don't make this about me. I'm not the one that slapped some guy around and stuck his head in the toilet. 
 What do you know about it? 
 Dad stuck somebody's head in the toilet? Shh. 
 I know you're supposed to be enforcing the law, not making it up as you go along. 
 You have no idea what goes on. 
 You only know what you think you know. 
 The laws are there for a reason. 
 Yeah, to protect the criminals. 
 No, to protect society from a police state. 
 Oh. 
 Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
 Such a jerk. 
 Hey, screw you, Erin! 
 No, screw you. Screw you! 
 You don't know what I had to... This is Sunday dinner. 
 Not a free-for-all. 
 Let's keep it civil. 
 Dad, if you're allowed to use force and torture, then you corrupt the moral fiber of the culture. 
 Nobody's in favor of torture. 
 The issue is the use of enhanced interrogation, is it ever justified? 
 I say no, and so does John McCain, by the way. 
 Okay then, you've got a ticking bomb. 
 The guy over there planted it. Lives are at stake. 
 Are his rights more important than innocent victims'? 
 Of course not. See? 
 Jamie, what do you think? 
 You got a law degree. 
 And a gun now, too. 
 And it's a lot of power. 
 You don't govern it, Erin's right. it's a slippery slope. 
 You just wait, little brother. 
 You wait until one night you chase some guy down a dark alley and that little object in his hand? 
 Maybe it's a cell phone. Maybe it's not. 
 It's true. I can say whatever I want, but I don't know what I would have done in his position. 
 I got to go, Dad. 
 Something up? The evidence from Tampa came in. 
 Do you want a sandwich or something? You barely touched your food. 
 No, babe. Thanks. I'll see you boys later. 
 Bye. Bye. 
 Oh, let me ask you one question, Erin. 
 What if it would've been Nicky, she only had 24 hours left... what would you want me to do then? 
 Me? 
 That's not fair. 
 Be honest. Some guy snatches her off the street, I got a hold of him, and he won't talk? 
 Give me a break. 
 Nicky? You don't have to worry. 
 They'd throw her back in ten minutes. 
 That's not funny. 
 Thanks, Grandpa. 
 I'm gonna go watch TV. 
 Nicky, you were not excused. 
 Nicky. 
 Nicky... you know better. 
 Come on, please? 
 Sean, you need to get back here. 
 Can we eat dessert in front of the TV? 
 I got a nice end piece here. 
 (laughing) 
 Give it to me. 
 FRANK: One for the sauce, one for me after that fracas. 
 Jamie? 
 JAMIE: Don't mind if I do. 
 (sighs) 
 That kid. 
 I'll tell Pop to put a governor on the motor. 
 Teenage girls are sensitive creatures, if I remember correctly. 
 I've got 25 cases on my desk, divorce papers that my ex won't sign, and a brother who thinks I'm Miss Goody Two-shoes? 
 I mean, doesn't he know that I would shoot this guy myself? 
 FRANK: Tough week, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Sometimes I wish I could just go upstairs to my old room and crawl under the covers like I never left. 
 The natives are getting restless out there. 
 Are you guys drinking or making dessert? 
 Whew. Drinking. 
 (kids chattering in other room) 
 ERIN: I'd better go help. 
 Your fellow grad with the sharpshooter medal, she's a babe. 
 Who, Maria? Romano? 
 Good friend? 
 Friend. 
 (chuckles) 
 How about you, Dad? 
 You got any good friends in your life? 
 Not a day goes by without... me thinking about your mom and what she's missing. 
 Seeing the kids grow up and... grandkids and... 
 The ship is in, huh? 
 Yeah. This is everything from Tampa. 
 Files, tapes, field interviews, photos. 
 Yeah, all that technology, and what does it come down to? 
 Couple of cops and some beat-up old boxes. 
 (car doors open) 
 Jameson Reagan? 
 What's going on? 
 I'm Special Agent Cisco. 
 This is Agent Anderson. 
 We'd like to talk to you for a minute. 
 About what? 
 You ever see one of these before? 
 What is that? 
 It's what they give a cop when he's initiated into a group called the Blue Templar. 
 The Blue Templar? 
 I thought that was a fairy tale. 
 My grandfather used to tell me stories about that when I was a kid. 
 A secret society inside the New York Police Department. 
 They were real. 
 They took care of their own and they cleaned up Dodge. 
 But now we've connected them with extortion, stealing drug evidence, cash, murder for hire. 
 My father know about this? 
 You're investigating the department and you haven't told my father? 
 We don't know how wide this spreads or how high it goes. 
 That's why we need somebody on the inside. 
 I'm out of here. 
 Wait a minute. 
 There's something you should hear. 
 (beep) 
 MAN (recorded): It's me. 
 I think I'm in. 
 I'll let you know when I get a location so I can wire up. 
 (beep) 
 It's me. 
 I think I'm in. I'll let you know when I get a location so I can wire up. 
 That's my brother, Joe. 
 This was his last message to us, the day before he was killed. 
 He was working with you? 
 Your brother wasn't killed in a bust gone bad. 
 They made him, then they killed him. 
 We thought you might want to come work for us and finish what he started. 
 We're only half way through the Tampa evidence, guys. 
 Hey. Manieri. 
 (grunts) 
 Come on, wake up. 
 Come on! 
 We've got three hours left before this creep Banse walks. 
 All right, all right. 
 Anybody find anything yet? 
 (DEMARCUS groans) 
 Yeah, I'm seeing double, Reagan. 
 (sighs) 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 DEMARCUS: Hey, look who's here. 
 TERESA: There he is! 
 Hey! 
 How you doing? 
 TERESA: We brought you a cake. 
 You brought me a cake? Did you bake this all by yourself? You did, huh? 
 Thank you. 
 We are so grateful you saved our baby. 
 Just glad she's home safe with her family now. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Would you like to have a tour of this big police station? 
 Yeah? Officer, would you take them around? 
 I'll see you soon, okay? 
 Tell me that doesn't make it all worth it. 
 Except now I'm gonna be the guy that puts that creep Banse back on the street. 
 Some other little girl's gonna end up like our cold case here in Florida. 
 Demarcus. 
 Yeah? 
 Come look at this. 
 What? 
 This picture. The girl in Florida. 
 Look at that. 
 The cross. The necklace. 
 Let's take a ride. 
 I can't believe this is happening. 
 My husband isn't a monster. Well, we don't even know yet how many other children he might've took. 
 Mrs. Banse, I'm afraid we're gonna have to take a closer look at the necklace. 
 The girl's parents said her name, Kathy, was engraved on the back. 
 My husband said that's because it's an antique. 
 DANNY: We need the cross for evidence, ma'am. 
 Could you remove it, please? 
 Mrs. Banse, please. 
 ERIN: Jay Castleman in the Attorney General's Office, please? 
 Hi, Jay. It's Erin Boyle, Manhattan D.A.'s Office. 
 We want your office to initiate proceedings to extradite Donald Banse to Florida for murder with special circumstance. 
 We have the cross that Kathy MacDonald was wearing when she disappeared in 2005. 
 Banse gave it to his wife around that time. 
 Tampa police have located what are believed to be the girl's remains in a storage container in Orlando registered in Banse's alias. 
 Appreciate it. Thank you. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Beautiful! 
 They're not shy about exercising capital punishment down in Florida. 
 Yeah. It's a happy outcome, this time. 
 Just give me this one, will you? 
 You don't get it, do you? 
 Say hello to the ACLU for me. 
 You're the one that's gonna need a lawyer, Danny. 
 You want to talk about that? 
 Probably. 
 Probably. 
 Thanks, sis. 
 See ya. 
 Whoo! 
 (bluesy mid-tempo intro plays) 
 WOMAN: ♪ Start spreading the news ♪ 
♪ I'm leaving today ♪ 
♪ I want to be a part of it ♪ 
♪ New York, New York... ♪ 
 Sorry, the train was stalled. 
 That's okay; coffee's still hot. 
 Any luck? 
 No, the damn fish must be changing shifts. 
 (ship's horn blows) 
 Beautiful spot, isn't it? 
 Caught a lot of fish here. 
 Just not today. Just not tod... 
 (laughs) 
 Jamie, you know when you asked me if I was seeing anybody? 
 I was not forthcoming. 
 Oh. 
 Because I am. 
 That's great. 
 Good. 
 I hate keeping secrets. 
 Yeah. 
 So, Jamie, what's going on? 
 What do you mean? 
 Come on, I'm your father. 
 You having second thoughts about wearing the uniform? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Just everything's new. 
 That T.O. of mine's a piece of work. 
 Renzulli. 
 What, are you keeping tabs on me? 
 I got a vested interest.
