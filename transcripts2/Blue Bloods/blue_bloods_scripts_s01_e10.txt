 King, can I get in? 
 (people chattering) 
 WOMAN: King, King. 
 (people chatting, laughing) 
 You two, come on. 
 MAN: King! Hey, King! 
 These two. 
 WOMAN: Hey! MAN: Hey, remember me? 
 Not tonight. MAN 2: King, just the two of us. 
 King! 
 You. Come on, over here. 
 Come on, man. 
 WOMAN: Looking good, King. 
 Not you, just her. 
 Sorry. 
 Seriously? 
 Yo, King. 
 You. 
 Hey. WOMAN: King, you remember me! 
 You look gorgeous tonight. Hey, King. 
 Friends, come on, very nice. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 You're not on the list. 
 What list? 
 My list. 
 You forget who the hell I am, King? 
 Yeah, I remember-- you're the suit who's not getting in. 
 Oh, ha. King? Me? 
 You think I'm a joke. 
 Let's see how wise you crack when I put a Glock 9 in your face. 
 You and what hedge fund? 
 King is dead! 
 The King is dead! 
 He's crazy. You're toast, man! 
 You. You're over! 
 Good. 
 (chattering) 
 DANNY: Listen, keep your hand-- this is to protect yourself. 
 Keep those hands up at all times. 
 Come on, right there. 
 All right, one, two, come on, one, two. 
 Oh! Ah, you got to watch the left. 
 Sean-o, you're up, come on. 
 Sit down, stay right there, and let your brot... 
 Oh! 
 Watch the right, Dad. 
 What are you doing? "Watch the right." 
 Knucklehead. 
 What are you doing? Okay. 
 All right, enough roughhousing. 
 Give your dad a hug. 
 He's working nights this week; you're not gonna see a lot of him. All right. 
 No, five minutes. No, five more minutes. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Time for bed. 
 Upstairs, and get ready for bed. 
 I'll be up in a minute. Thank you. 
 Go. 
 That was unfair, I wasn't ready. 
 Brush your teeth. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm gonna miss you this week. 
 Yeah. I hate when you work night watch. 
 I know, nothing good happens after midnight. 
 That's right, so you be safe out there. 
 I will. And watch your left. 
 (grunting) Watch your right, watch, watch... 
 (both laughing) 
 Yeah, I know. 
 You bet, Jimmy. 
 Looking forward to tomorrow. 
 Oh, and happy anniversary. 
 (chuckles) 
 Happy anniversary? 
 Oh, inside joke with an old partner. 
 Ha-ha, Jimmy Burke of the 2-1. 
 I thought I heard something slithering. 
 He ain't perfect, but he's my partner. 
 Isn't that what somebody I know used to say? 
 You couldn't inherit your mother's cooking, right? 
 You had to get that elephant memory of hers. 
 Yeah, but I got your sunny disposition. 
 Wait, the 2-1. 
 Weren't you involved in a shooting up there? 
 I was. 
 You never really told us about that. 
 Well, son, you were young. 
 Last thing I wanted you kids to think about was your old man could have bought it on a rooftop in Harlem. 
 It was that close? 
 (sighs) 
 Close enough where I call him each year on the anniversary. 
 I got to turn in; I got a big day tomorrow. 
 Good night. 
 Night, Dad. 
 Good night, Francis. 
 Night, Pop. 
 Jimmy Burke took two bullets that were meant for your dad. 
 He spent six months out... line of duty. 
 I don't get it, Grandpa. 
 How could you have a beef with the guy that saved Dad's life? 
 Uh-oh. 
 Looks like your king is in trouble.

 We just took a statement from a six-four transsexual escort who thinks her Labradoodle was dognapped by her shrink. 
 How can I not be having fun right now? 
 I'm telling you, Jack, they can keep Central Park and Times Square. 
 This is the New York that I love-- 
 the one you never see on a postcard. 
 Now, there's an untapped market-- 
 tranny hooker postcards. 
 Come on, tell me there's anywhere you'd rather be right now than out on the streets with me. 
 Yeah, my bed. Your bed? 
 What are you talk...? Then move to Jersey, Jackie. 
 Come on, this is the city that never sleeps. 
 Can't beat this place. 
 I heart New York.

 "Blue Bloods" - Season 1, Episode 10 
 "After Hours" 
 DOA was right here-- Richard King, 27, aka King-- 
 the doorman from the club. 
 CSU puts the shooter somewhere out in the street. 
 Eyewitnesses? 
 Got about a couple dozen people trying to get into the club, but everybody's looking this way. 
 All right, so shots ring out, everybody scrambles, plus they're all drunk. 
 By the time they get their bearings, our shooter's in the wind. 
 Almost like you've done this before, Detective. 
 Yeah, once or twice. 
 So nobody's eyes were working. What about their ears? 
 Witnesses confirm hearing one shot. 
 Vic caught it in the neck. 
 I see one eyeball that wasn't snockered. 
 Anyone here from the club we can talk to? 
 Owner's right over there. 
 JACKIE: Sabrina Glick-- she owns this place? 
 What, you know her? 
 No, not really, just what I read about her. 
 She's a Page Six staple. 
 You'd like her-- she only comes out at night. 
 Let me know if you want help questioning her, Detective, huh? 
 (chuckling): That's funny. Get lost. 
 Go. 
 I'd just come out to check on things. 
 I was about 20 feet away when it happened. 
 But you didn't see who shot him? 
 You'll see it all on there. 
 (screaming) 
 DANNY: Actually, the shooter's out of frame there. 
 Where were you again? 
 I'm right over there. 
 You have any other cameras, another angle? 
 Can't see much of anything here. 
 JACKIE: Well, we're going to need to take this for evidence. 
 You know, TARU can enhance the video, maybe expand the view. 
 Yeah. 
 Um, what can you tell us about this guy King? 
 What kind of guy was he? 
 He was Brad Pitt in Thelma & Louise. 
 He just popped. 
 Two months after I put him on the rope, he put us on the map. 
 We've been the hottest club in New York ever since. 
 We're still talking about the door guy here? 
 DJs and doormen-- the new celebrities. 
 They're the real stars around here. 
 I mean, all due respect. 
 I worked the door at the Vault back in the days. 
 So, what happened, you're too old now? 
 Too married and two kids. 
 (chuckles) 
 Too bad. 
 Okay, well, uh, any girlfriends, jealous lovers-- uh, King have any of those? 
 He's been with Benita Ginn ever since I've known him. 
 She's a night nurse at the downtown hospital. 
 Beautiful, sweet, not exactly the murdering type. 
 How about someone with a grudge? 
 Any enemies? 
 Only the rest of the city. 
 You know, these doormen-- they're the one person in the city that can say no to the rich and powerful. 
 Did King piss anyone off last night? 
 Yeah, you know, I didn't think about that before, but the bouncers did mention that one of our guys got pretty angry with King last night when he turned him away. 
 How angry? 
 Angry enough to threaten to come back with a gun, but like I said... 
 Do you know a name? 
 Vince Walker. 
 He runs one of the biggest funds on the street, but... 
 You know how these guys are, I mean... 
 Well, do you know where we can find this Vince Walker? 
 He's in your phone? 
 Yeah, anyone who's anyone is in my phone. 
 (muttering): I'm not in her phone. 
 130 North Moore, Tribeca. 
 Thanks. 
 Let's flag this guy-- 
 credit cards, phone, and, uh, license. 
 Could be a flight risk. 
 Oh, and if you happen to think of anything else, don't hesitate to call. 
 I won't, Danny. 
 Oh, and, um... 
 You, too. 
 Thanks. 
 She's doing her residency in Laguna. 
 Can you believe that-- a doctor in the family? 
 I don't know what's harder to believe-- 
 little Mary-Kathleen is a doctor or there's a Bronx Burke living in Laguna. 
 Ain't that the truth. 
 Something on your mind, Jimmy. 
 Word's going around that Deputy Chief Russo is going to pull the plug. 
 He puts in his papers this week. 
 Any chance I'd be considered for the spot? 
 Being number two at Manhattan South'd be a stepping stone, and the bump to chief-- it wouldn't hurt. 
 You're not happy in the 15th? 
 Oh, no, no, not at all. I'm having a ball there, but I've been the C.O. for three years. 
 I'm ready for the next challenge. 
 Your numbers are pretty good. 
 And they're getting better. 
 I'm facing the firing squad at CompStat this week. 
 I think your guys are going to like what they hear. 
 Well, you know how I do things, Jimmy. 
 I won't do contracts, but if you're right for the job, you'll be in the mix. 
 Well, that's all I'm asking-- to be considered. 
 What is this,  a GQ photo shoot? 
 Hey, Erin Reagan, as I live and breathe. 
 What's going on? 
 Breakfast with Judge Walters. 
 He's been killing me on my search and seizures, so I thought maybe some hash browns would soften him up. 
 He's on a no-carb diet. 
 JIMMY: Oh, come on, sit down. 
 It's like having flowers at the table. 
 You want some coffee? 
 Yeah, I'll join you boys. 
 Doorman says we just missed him. 
 This guy is in the wind, Jack. 
 Wall Street heliport. What's up? 
 Real Time just got a hit on the guy's AmEx. 
 He rented a chopper. 
 You think he's going sightseeing? 
 Yeah. 
 (sirens wailing) 
 (tires screeching) 
 Hey, hey, kill that right now! 
 You, put your hands in the air! 
 Put your hands where I can see 'em! 
 I didn't do it! 
 What?! I didn't do it! 
 Oh, you didn't do it?! No. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Well, get back in the chopper and enjoy your trip. 
 He's taking off, everyone. He didn't do it. 
 Thank you. 
 He's kidding, moron. 
 Get over there. Let's go. 
 Over here. 
 My guy didn't do it. Is that why he booked the helicopter to take him to a private jet to take him to Cuba? 
 Yeah, one of the few countries we don't have an extradition treaty with? 
 He was nervous; he knew it wouldn't look good. 
 But I can assure you my client is an upstanding member of the community. 
 No, your client's a scumbag, okay? 
 But being that we're the kinder, gentler NYPD, if he's got a good alibi, we're all ears. 
 Otherwise, it's three hots and a cot, courtesy of the City of New York. 
 Fine, Detective. 
 Go to Hell. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 No pun intended, but what the hell is this place? 
 Dominatrix dungeon. 
 Don't tell me, you heart this New York, too. 
 (groans) 
 Oh, God. 
 People have a common misconception about what we do here. I bet. 
 For the most part, most of our clients are average citizens. 
 Many of them are highly successful businessmen. 
 Right. In other words, you beat the crap out of spoiled rich guys who hate themselves. 
 It's a bit more complicated than that, Detective. 
 I'm sure it is. 
 You know, I had a guy ask me to lick his boots once. 
 I broke his nose instead. 
 (laughs) Well, he should have known better. 
 You don't seem to be the submissive type. 
 Lady, if I take out my handcuffs, I'm not playing. 
 Don't touch me. 
 (clears throat) 
 Fine. Like I said, Mr. Walker was, in fact, here at the time of question. 
 So unless you'd like me to give you a complimentary whipping or you'd like to give me a spanking... 
 ...I'll see you out. 
 Actually, we're not quite ready to go yet. 
 (softly): Ouch, that hurt. 
 I'm sure it does. 
 Not that you exactly strike me as the girl-next-door type, but you got any proof other than your say-so? 
 (on video): Move! Come on! WOMAN: See the time code here? 
 (Walker barking) 
 Like I said, 3:25 a.m. 
 Harder! Woof! 
 JACKIE: This guy manages a $700 million fund? 
 Yeah, and we wonder why our economy's in the toilet. 
 DANNY: Is that a diaper? 
 JACKIE: I think it is. 
 He's a good boy! 
 (barking) 
 JIMMY: Good morning, CompStat panel. 
 The 15th Precinct is proud to report a reduction of 20% in violent crime across the board in the last three reporting periods. 
 Ten-hut! 
 As you were. 
 Inspector, let's talk about the strong-arm robberies in the vicinity of the 68th Street Station. 
 What were your deployment tactics there? 
 I employed a two-tiered strategy. 
 My anticrime units gave it special attention; I increased the plain-clothes presence in the station itself. 
 The 7-4 had a similar situation in La Guardia Park. 
 Those same deployment tactics proved unsuccessful. 
 Any thoughts as to why? Well, I can't speak for the 7-4, sir, but at the 15th, we hit 'em hard, we hit 'em often, and over time, those are the results we achieved. 
 All right, let's move on to burglaries. 
 Your numbers are down considerably. 
 Care to enlighten us as to why? 
 I started a burglary task force, picked out my youngest, sharpest officers. 
 Seems to be working. 
 And where could you be improving? 
 Where could we not, Commissioner? 
 Thank you, Inspector. Carry on. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Let's turn our attention to the rash of push-in robberies, Inspector. 
 LINDA: Look who's here. Hey, you're home. 
 Hey. Just trying to catch a few hours sleep before I head back out there. 
 Hey...! 
 What are you doing! What are you doing! Daddy's home! 
 What are you doing! Hey, Dad! 
 Easy, you guys. Come on. What are you doing! 
 Watch your uniform. What are you doing! 
 What are you doing! What are you doing! Daddy! 
 Don't forget, we have dinner at your father's house tonight. 
 He's out of town this weekend. 
 I'll be there, I'll be there. Mommy, what's that? 
 Who's Sabrina? 
 That's a witness in the case. 
 She writes her number on a cocktail napkin? 
 Come on, she owns a nightclub-- what do you want me to do? 
 Oh, a nightclub. Great. 
 Danny's favorite old stomping grounds. 
 Kids, get in the car. 
 We'll be late for school. Bye, boys. 
 Bye. 
 Love you. 
 Love you, too. 
 (insects chittering, chirping) 
 "A mysterious stranger is on his way." 
 No, he's not. 
 Uh, yes, he is. 
 FRANK: Not while your grandpa has 36,000 armed men at his disposal, he's not. 
 ERIN: That's right. 
 I like your hair; I think it looks nice. 
 Thank you. 
 Glad somebody noticed. 
 Henry, your turn. 
 The day I put my future in the hands of a cookie is the day they're singing "Danny Boy" for me. 
 Oh, you're a party pooper. 
 Buzz kill. 
 I'll go. You already went! Twice! 
 Guys, come on. 
 Here, you can read me mine. 
 "You are wise beyond your years." 
 That's very fitting, Jamie. 
 DANNY: Mm-hmm. 
 For the wise man who left Harvard crimson for NYPD blues. 
 Better check the expiration date on that one. 
 Oh, very funny. Still the best decision I ever made. 
 Amen. What do you got, Dad? 
 "You will take a chance." 
 Ooh... 
 And it will bite you on the tush. 
 You have been grumpy all night. 
 What gives? 
 I plead the Fifth, Counselor. 
 Pop's upset because I'm considering bumping Jimmy Burke up to deputy chief. 
 He hit it out of the park today at Compstat, by the way, Pop. 
 Does that mean you're giving him the bump? 
 I still don't get it, Grandpa. 
 Look, what Jimmy Burke did for your father cannot be repaid. 
 But what he did to his own wife cannot be forgiven. 
 Jimmy Burke was a cheater? 
 15 years and three children, (chuckles): he hooks up with some chippy from the bar. 
 Now, it tore the family apart. 
 Call me old-fashioned, but, uh, don't ask me to trust the man if his own family won't. 
 I don't know, Grandpa, a lot of guys in the 15th would run through a brick wall for Jimmy Burke. 
 They think he's a stand-up guy. 
 Then you know a lot of guys with their heads up their asses. 
 Henry. 
 (mock gasp) 
 And you-- since when are you okay when a guy cheats on his wife? 
 I didn't say I was okay with a guy who cheats on his wife. 
 I said it doesn't necessarily make the guy a bad cop. 
 Oh. Well, now that we've got our priorities straight. 
 (phone rings) 
 (quietly): Saved by the cell. 
 Uh, I'm gonna take this-- it's for my case. 
 Reagan. 
 (dance music playing) 
 Is this a bad time? 
 (dance music playing over phone) 
 Is this Sabrina? 
 Oh, I like the way you say my name. 
 What is it? 
 You said to call if something comes up. 
 Something's come up. 
 Okay, you want to tell me about it? 
 That's for me to know and for you to find out. 
 All right. I'm on my way. 
 (sighs) 
 Who was that? 
 Hey. 
 Who was that, Danny? 
 Witness. 
 You mean, Sabrina? 
 You know what's funny? 
 Of all the cases in New York, you happen to catch the one starring... Angelina Jolie. 
 It's my work, babe. 
 That's what I came out here to remind you of. 
 HENRY: I'm just saying the man's no good. 
 Give it a rest, Pop. 
 I got to go. 
 You want to talk? 
 No, I don't think that's a good idea, Frank. 
 You're my daughter, too-- you know that. 
 Thanks. 
 (hip-hop playing) 
 
 
 
 Jackie? Hey, Sabrina just called. 
 She said she's got something for me. 
 Why don't you meet me at the club. 
 Yeah, can't. Uh, just got ahold of King's girlfriend, Benita. 
 I'm on my way to see her now. 
 All right. All right, well, double back. 
 We'll meet at the squad room in an hour; I'll see you there. 
 Yeah. Great.

 Hey, Dad, you got a minute? 
 I haven't seen that look on your face since you brought home a "C" in science.

 It was the only "C" you ever got. 
 (sighs) 
 It's your mother's ring. 
 (quietly): Yeah. 
 We called off the wedding. 
 She's off in London for six months. 
 It's not her fault, it's mine. 
 Ever since I came on the job, I haven't really been there for her in a real way, so... 
 Sometimes the job is tougher at home than it is on the streets. 
 I just hope I haven't let the best thing that ever happened to me walk out the door. 
 (sighs) 
 Jamie... you know... (sighs) 
 when you decided to give up the law and become a cop I was... disappointed. 
 Well, I, um... 
 (chuckles softly) 
 I knew you weren't thrilled. 
 Well... you knew how much your mom wanted to keep you out of the family business, and... 
 I felt that... the least I could do was see that Mary's wish was honored. 
 But you didn't stop me. 
 It wasn't my decision to make. 
 (sighs) 
 And it wasn't your mom's. 
 It was yours. 
 For what it's worth... there's not a day goes by I'm not proud to have you on my force.

 I am.

 King and I drove up from North Carolina three years ago. 
 Weren't even dating yet. 
 Just really good friends with something in common. 
 Both dying to move to New York. 
 Okay, so, uh, when did King become your boyfriend? 
 Somewhere around Maryland. 
 He pulled over by the side of the road, said he couldn't go any further till he told me his secret. 
 And then he kissed me. 
 It was one of those kisses, you know? 
 Yeah. Afraid I do. 
 From that moment on, we just never left each other's side. 
 I was the first one to get a job, working nights at the hospital. 
 We wanted our days together, so it was perfect when he got the job as the doorman. 
 Perfect New York story, huh? 
 It was... until it wasn't. 
 A couple of months ago, things started to change. 
 He started, uh, hitting the after-hours scene pretty hard, especially the underground poker rooms. 
 King was a gambler? 
 Yeah, just not a very good one. 
 (dance music playing) 
 In case I got you in hot water with Mrs. Detective Reagan. 
 What is this? 
 Last best kept secret in New York. 
 My favorite Nolita boutique. 
 Buy her something nice, all will be forgiven. 
 And you brought me down here just for this? 
 Wow, you really are married, huh? 
 No foreplay, just right to it. 
 You're enjoying yourself, aren't you? 
 I'm just happy you're here. 
 I'm not here. I'm on duty. 
 So, what's up? 
 King's cell phone. 
 I found it in the back room this morning. 
 A lot of calls from the same number. 
 Girlfriend? Lemon. 
 Lemon? 
 Who's Lemon? 
 He's British. 
 Some kind of gangster or something. 
 He runs this really sceney, after-hours casino. 
 King goes there a lot? 
 He swore it was just for fun. 
 A way to blow off steam after working the door all night. 
 I had no idea how bad it was till I read his e-mails last night. 
 He owed Lemon over $100,000. 
 That's a lot of steam. 
 You think Lemon could have killed him? 
 I don't know, but he had 100,000 reasons. 
 (sniffles) 
 Don't worry. 
 If-If he did this, we'll nail him. 
 (sniffles) 
 It's-It's not that. 
 It's just, uh... 
 I can't believe King did this to us. 
 You're pregnant? 
 Eight weeks. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Okay, so where do I find this Lemon, just in case I want to give him a squeeze? 
 I'll tell you if you dance with me. 
 I can't do that. 
 Alphabet City, corner of Sixth and B. 
 Great. Thank you. 
 And I don't think you're the kind of guy who likes to take charity. 
 I'm not dancing with you. 
 (laughs) 
 This is not happening. 
 Oh, come on, Danny. 
 You remember what it's like out here where all the fun is. 
 It depends what you consider fun.

 I'm just saying, if your wife saw your eyes on that one... 
 (scoffs) 
 If my wife saw me, yeah, I'd probably be dancing on crutches. 
 Exactly. But I did get an address of a new suspect. 
 Oh. Do you want to go knock a door down? 
 Yes, please. Let's go. 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 Show me your hands! Get your hands up! 
 Show me those hands! Let's go! 
 DANNY: Leave the money on the tables! 
 Keep your hands where we can see 'em. 
 Out of the way! 
 There he is. 
 You must be Lemon. (British accent): Delighted to meet you. 
 (mimicking accent): Delighted to meet you, too, mate. 
 Yes, he owed me money. 
 No, I didn't kill him. 
 Sit down. 
 100K. It's a lot more than just money. 
 Can't be good for you, Lemon-- 
 having that kind of paper out on the street. 
 Muscle and murder are passé. 
 I'm into synergy. 
 Hmm. DANNY: Synergy? 
 So you're kind of like more the Gordon Gekko type than the John Gotti type. 
 The millennium's a decade old, Detective. 
 The future's in coming together, not breaking apart. 
 And how exactly did you and King come together? 
 Mm. I forgave him his, uh, considerable debt, and he accepted my offer to join me in an exciting new business venture. 
 An offer he couldn't refuse? 
 Good to see blackmail's still in vogue. 
 Some tools of the trade are timeless. Yeah. 
 Now tell me about this new business venture. 
 We were opening a new nightclub. 
 You and King? Mm-hmm. 
 Yes, I bring the money, he brings the crowd. 
 We would have owned this city in a week. 
 So, King was leaving Sabrina? 
 LEMON: Mm. 
 Scoop of the century, I know. 
 He was breaking it to her the night he was shot. 
 (chortles) 
 I gather it, uh... it didn't go over too well. 
 Yeah. No synergy there. 
 And I'm out a hundred Gs. 
 Erin Boyle? 
 Molly Griffin. 
 From the Kelly case last year? 
 Oh, Mrs. Griffin, yes. 
 I am sorry to bother you. 
 It's just... there's something going on, and I knew you were the only one I could talk to. 
 Oh. 
 It's about the police department. 
 Now, I know your father is the one for... 
 Okay, if you have a complaint about the police department, you really have to... 
 No, please. I don't want to cause any trouble. 
 I come from a police family. 
 I know how hard their jobs are. 
 It's... just... something's not right about this. 
 Okay. What is it? 
 My granddaughter. 
 She was mugged a few months ago in the stairwell of our building. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Hey. 
 Linda and I are fine, Dad. 
 Are you're getting better at this, or am I getting worse? 
 No. You know what it is. 
 Your voice-- it goes up in pitch when you're worried about one of your kids. 
 Is that right? 
 Well, put your old man out of his misery and tell me I've got nothing to worry about. 
 You got nothing to worry about, Dad. 
 Talk to you later. 
 So, is it true that King told you him and Lemon were opening a club right down the street only hours before he got killed? 
 She's not going to answer that. 
 Do not answer that. Yes. 
 It's fine. Danny and I are friends. 
 That's quite a big piece of the puzzle you left out. 
 I'm not stupid. I knew how it would make me look. 
 It looks worse now. 
 All right, Danny, please. 
 I mean, seriously, do I look like someone who goes around killing people? 
 Hey, King moves to the new rope right down the block. 
 You and I both know, all your customers are going with him. 
 You're a tough girl. 
 You're not gonna just sit around and let that happen. 
 That's nonsense. 
 Really? That's motive, Sabrina. 
 Okay. Yes, I was pissed off when I found out he was leaving. 
 And why shouldn't I be? 
 He was nothing before I put him on that door. 
 That's my stage, I made him a star, and I'm supposed to be happy when he leaves and takes everything I built with him? 
 Exactly how unhappy were you? 
 This interview is officially over. 
 I wouldn't go too far, okay? 
 That enhanced video comes back, and you don't make a cameo, you're gonna be seeing a lot of us. 
 You know how to reach me. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 You bring dinner? I did. 
 Ah, roast beef. 
 Nice. 
 All right, let's go eat. 
 Okay. Come on. 
 Hey, Jackie. 
 FRANK: No. 
 Not at all. 
 I know you'll do us proud at Manhattan South, Inspector. 
 And once again, congratulations. 
 Knock, knock. 
 Hey. 
 I was just heating up some Mother Kelly's. 
 You interested? Uh-uh. 
 We need to talk. 
 What about? 
 Jimmy Burke. 
 So she's a suspect now? 
 Yeah. 
 Any chance I can get on the jury? 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 In the meantime, I know I don't always get to do special things for you, but... today I did. 
 Oh, Danny... 
 Hmm? 
 Look at that. 
 What do you think? 
 Purple, your favorite color, match your sweater. 
 Look at that. Oh. 
 What? 
 In 15 years of marriage, you ever see me wear something like this? 
 What's wrong with it? It's nice. 
 It's a new style. 
 It's gonna look great on you. 
 New style? 
 You been reading Vogue lately,  have you, Danny Reagan? 
 (sighs) 
 Look, I'm a big girl. 
 I know sometimes a man's eyes wander. 
 And if your mind wanders, too, a little, then... so be it. 
 Just don't ever make me feel this small again. 
 (sighs) 
 ERIN: Her granddaughter was mugged  in the stairwell, but when the officers from the 15th took her complaint, they classified the attack as harassment. 
 Bet it felt like more than harassment to Mrs. Griffin's granddaughter. 
 So, three weeks later, a friend in the neighborhood is burglarized. 
 This time, they classify the burglary as trespassing. 
 Jimmy's cooking the books. 
 Yeah, but why? 
 He turns a felony into a misdemeanor, it looks like violent crime's dropping. 
 His stats go down, his stock goes up. 
 I'm sorry, Dad. 
 I heard you when I came in. 
 You already gave Burke the promotion, didn't you? 
 I wasn't talking to Burke. 
 I gave Gibson the Manhattan South Command. 
 You already passed over Burke? Why? 
 Trust your gut. 
 It's a funny thing about decisions. 
 You don't seem to need to have to talk yourself into the right ones. 
 Good for you, Dad. 
 Yeah. 
 Only now I got to say good-bye to an old friend. 
 (sighs) 
 Hey. Think fast. Oh. 
 Oh, I could have told you that wasn't gonna work. 
 Yeah? So why didn't you? 
 'Cause you had it coming. 
 And I also knew that the store didn't take returns. 
 Well, it looks good on you. 
 You keep it. Oh, really? 
 TARU finally uploaded the video enhancement on your nightclub surveillance video. 
 Beautiful. Thank you. 
 Look at this. We got a wider picture. 
 Look at that, there's Sabrina. 
 Wow. 
 Look who was telling the truth. 
 Let's watch it again. 
 You see that? 
 Yeah. That was a flash. 
 What was it? A reflection of the shot? 
 Maybe. 
 That's not a reflection. That's a spark. 
 Our bullet hit a streetlamp. 
 A ricochet? 
 Exactly. 
 So that means that King wasn't the target. 
 Then who was? 
 The only other person who was there. 
 Sabrina. 
 DANNY: Listen. The bullet that killed King ricocheted off a streetlight outside the club. 
 JACKIE: He wasn't the intended target. 
 All right, well, then who? 
 You. 
 Yeah, no. That's ridiculous. 
 Who in the world would want to kill me? 
 Something tells me the list might be a little longer than you think. 
 Listen, we're gonna need the names of anybody you're romantically involved with. 
 Uh, yeah, you and my mother. 
 Hey. Whoever tried to kill you is still out there. 
 You want to give them a second chance? 
 Be my guest. And you think the list is so long I need a pad? 
 Sabrina. 
 We're running out of time here, okay? 
 You know, I don't think I like the way you say my name anymore. 
 Fine. Then who? 
 There was only one. 
 Fine. Let's get this person on the phone. 
 Give him a call. Can't. 
 Why not? 
 Because he was shot the other night. 
 Of course. King? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Did Benita know? 
 Well, I certainly didn't tell her. 
 Right. She's two months pregnant. Did you know that? 
 You even care about that? 
 Probably not. Easy, Jack. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna wait outside. 
 That was your wife I saw the other day, wasn't it? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 Let me ask you something. 
 What has she got that I don't have? 
 (chuckles) 
 Me. 
 I'm sure you know by now. 
 NYPD's got more gossips than a beauty parlor. 
 Gibson's the right man for the job, and he deserves it. 
 Well, I appreciate you giving it to me straight. 
 You've been cooking the books, Jimmy. 
 Now... you give it to me straight. 
 Frank... 
 I've given 40 years of my life to this job. 
 You know what I got to show for it? 
 Three bullet holes, two destroyed marriages and not a decent night's sleep in a decade. 
 I'm not some tomato in the bar, getting weak in the knees from your war stories, Jimmy. 
 For what it's worth, it's only the past six months. 
 I was gonna get my bump and then pull the plug. 
 You meant well, otherwise you wouldn't have done it. 
 I've heard it, Jimmy. 
 My whole life as a cop, I've heard it. 
 Come on, Frank. 
 I'm carrying two alimonies and four college tuitions. 
 Going out a two star was my only shot at not spending my golden years hanging sheet rock. 
 If you no longer had the commitment, you should have put in your papers. 
 All we've got out there is our word, Jimmy. 
 We lose that, we got nothing. 
 We lose that,  we are nothing. 
 Frank... 
 Everything we've been through... 
 You gonna bust me down? 
 To Captain. 
 And I'm reassigning you to the 1-2-5. 
 Staten Island. 
 Or you can pull the plug right now, and leave with your pension and your dignity intact. 
 Thanks, Frank. 
 Everything we've been through... 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I got some police work to do. 
 JACKIE: Heading back to North Carolina? 
 Another five minutes, and I'm done here. 
 I don't suppose you'd be willing to take a little walk? 
 Afraid that's not possible. 
 When did you learn they were sleeping together, Benita? 
 That night. 
 I went on the computer to send him our first sonogram, and he left his e-mail page open. 
 Where'd you get the gun? 
 He gave it to me a year ago. 
 To keep me safe. 
 Ironic, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Just keep walking. 
 Officer Gonsalves? 
 You were on the warrant squad with my brother that night. 
 I said "walk." 
 You said to meet on the next corner. 
 I lied. 
 Better tell your brother Danny you need a refresher on picking up tails, Reagan. 
 I've been on you for three blocks. 
 Where are we going? Just move. 
 How did you find me? 
 Who are you working for? And what do you want? 
 Even think about lying, and I'm a faint memory. 
 I got your number from the Pension Section. 
 Follow the money. Not bad, rook. 
 I'm not working for anyone. 
 I want to know what happened to my brother Joe. 
 Read the official report. 
 I did. It's a snow job. 
 Okay. 
 So maybe you've got a little Reagan blood in you, after all. 
 Why did you leave the department? 
 I loved being on the job, but my daughter needs a mother, not a dead cop. 
 Did somebody threaten you? 
 Was it Blue Templar? 
 Is that who killed Joe? 
 So, how we doing? 
 You tell me. 
 I never stepped out of bounds, Linda. 
 I ain't that guy. 
 I know. 
 Do you? 
 Of course. 
 Just... 
 I know Danny Reagan from when we first met. 
 Running around this city, all hours of the night, more girlfriends than I had shoes. 
 Yeah, but when we got our thing going, I never looked back, did I? 
 No. 
 But sometimes I wonder. 
 Maybe you miss it. 
 I mean... 
 Sure is more exciting than sleepy Staten Island with me and the boys. 
 Says who? 
 You mean that? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I love you.
