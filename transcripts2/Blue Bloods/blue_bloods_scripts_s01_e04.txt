 I'm telling you, this guy is as a solid as they come. 
 You reached out to me with this score, I'm thinkin... 
 There's no guy more right for this than my man Kola. 
 Why is he giving me a beef about whether or not the stones are gonna be there? 
 You tell him how far back we go? Come on. 
 I've known you my whole life, bro. 
 No, man. It's just, he's a perfectionist. 
 Trust me. That kind of attitude pays off. 
 I've been with this guy in some serious takedowns. 
 Montreal, Detroit, Chicago. 
 He never blinks. 
 Here he comes. 
 Okay, one more time. 
 I know, I know. Never leave the truck. 
 So I am boring you? 
 No, man. 
 It's j just... 
 (sighs) 
 I get it. 
 Never leave the truck. 
 You, three minutes means three minutes. 
 Not a second more. 
 When we are inside... 
 I watch the room. 
 You watch the room. 
 Somebody wants to be a hero... 
 ...you make them a martyr. 
 WOMAN: How are you, sir? 
 Nice to see you again. 
 Sorry, sir. The Commissioner is not... 
 He's my son, Einstein. 
 Relax. 
 Commissioner... 
 It's okay, Bill. He's my father. 
 (chuckles) 
 Hey, my old Fitz Special. 
 You know, you'd get a lot more firepower if you used an automatic. 
 Oh, these days, I'm surrounded by people who can shoot for me, Pop. 
 Still, the thing's practically an antique. 
 It was built to last. 
 (laughs) 
 That's exactly what your grandfather said when he gave it to me. 
 I like carrying your gun, Pop. 
 Fair enough. Oh, I got my new I.D. 
 I always thought it was silly how they stamped retired all over it. 
 May as well say, "Rest in peace" 
 You're lucky they're still paying your pension. 
 (laughs) 
 Yeah. What is this? 
 It's supposed to be a camel. 
 It was a gift from the police chief in Amman, Jordan. 
 Brave New World. 
 I was lucky if I got a pine plaque from the Poughkeepsie police. 
 Here. Pastrami on rye. 
 Mrs. Friggins' Kitchen. 
 What happened to your war on cholesterol? 
 Mm... 
 Let's just say it's a tactical retreat. 
 (clears throat) 
 JAMIE:  Hey, so we're set for Shakespeare in the Park tonight? 
 DANNY:  Can't wait. 
 I was sitting with Grandpa the other night. 
 We were looking at pictures from the old days. 
 I remember seeing this pin on his uniform-- The Blue Templar. 
 Oh? 
 That was some kind of fraternal group? 
 Yeah, back in the days. 
 He said you were tapped for it, too. 
 But if it was such a, such a back-in-the-day thing... 
 You a cop or a reporter? 
 It's nothing for a rookie to worry about. 
 KOLA:  If we work smart, by tonight we will be rich. 
 RENZULLI: Get out of here. 
 You and Danny bringing the girls to a play? 
 You, Mr. Ivy League. 
 But Danny... 
 Yeah, Shakespeare in the Park. 
 My cousin's a sergeant in Central Park. 
 He hooked us up with the tickets. 
 No waiting on line. 
 Danny Reagan and Shakespeare in the same sentence. 
 Yeah. 
 It's the funniest thing I ever heard. 
 I'm trying to civilize him. 
 Yeah? You and what army? 
 DISPATCH: Sector Adam 10-52. 
 Family at four-six-seven West five-two. 
 Ah, nah. 
 Not today. 
 DISPATCH: Please respond. You know this job? 
 Do I ever. 
 It's a chronic domestic job. 
 Every three months, these two knuckleheads go to war over something. 
 Here. 
 The only thing good about this friggin' job is it keeps my marriage in perspective. 
 John Ganley is a pig! 
 He sleeps with women not his wife! 
 He's a lothario! 
 Alice... you changed tactics. 
 Shows initiative. 
 A pig! 
 RENZULLI: Alice, you can basically say whatever you want, but the bullhorn and the pig, they gotta... 
 Penelope stays. 
 You named it? JOHN: Hey, Renzulli? 
 Yeah? You see what I'm up against? 
 I read the Constitution. 
 Freedom of speech. 
 Counselor, you want to help me out here? 
 Abundant... 
 (bullhorn squeaks) 
 Abundant case law supports restraint of speech when it infringes on public order. 
 Where'd you find this one, Renzulli? 
 Hey, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. 
 Alice, you can stay, but the bullhorn and Penelope-- they got to go. 
 Officer, deflate the pig. 
 You got it, Sarge. 
 Okay, three minutes. 
 (beep) 
 WOMAN: Yeah, I can talk, Mom. 
 I'm on meal break. 
 Yeah, no, John has not told me anything. 
 He says it's an anniversary surprise. 
 So I'm kind of looking forward to that. 
 (gasps) 
 (panting) 
 Yeah. 
 At the end of the day, I'm not gonna force him. 
 Three minutes now! 
 (door slams shut) 
 (FEMALE OFFICER) 
 Thank you so much for letting Vincent stay over. 
 All right. Bye. 
 Police! Don't move! 
 (gunfire) 
 (people screaming) 
 (tires squealing) 
 (people shouting and screaming) 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 We have an officer down. 
 A uniform assigned to Manhattan South task force. 
 She happened on a 10-30 
 in the diamond district. 
 Who is she? 
 Police Officer Michelle Martin. 
 On the job since '04, married, one child. 
 A boy. 
 Six years old. 
 Likely? Not likely? 
 She was pronounced en route to Bellevue, sir. 
 We're withholding that information so it doesn't get out over the airwaves. Assemble all the super chiefs and chiefs in the command center, forthwith. 
 Yes, sir. Hogan? 
 Sir? 
 I want all tours extended, no cops go home. 
 (sighs) 
 ♪ Blue Bloods 1x04 ♪ 
 Officer Down 
 Original Air Date on October 15, 2010 
 (siren wailing) 
 Inspector? Hey. 
 This is my new partner, Detective Jackie Curatola. 
 We worked Manhattan North Narcotics back in the day. 
 Tough first day in the command. 
 No joke. 
 So, what do we got? 
 Bad news, Danny. 
 Kid was on the job six years. 
 She was in my command when I had the 3-4. 
 She was real police. 
 These guys knew what they were doing. 
 They were in and out in three minutes. 
 The take is north of five million. 
 So, this officer-- she just happened upon this? 
 Yeah. According to her sergeant, she was on duty, but out to meal. 
 She swung by the block to get her wedding ring resized. 
 Damn. 
 How are we doing on canvas? 
 The witnesses are all over the map with their descriptions of the perps The only thing they all agree on is three male whites, one tall. 
 Tall one's the shooter. 
 So the tall guy shoots her, she fires back after she's hit, and nails the small guy. 
 (sighs) 
 Tough kid. 
 All right, so, they come out, small guy's hit around here. 
 Stumbles over to the van. 
 This is probably his blood, so we got a bleeder. 
 I want to check out hospitals, doctors' offices, veterinarians. 
 Anywhere he might have gone to get some help. 
 All right, good, okay? 
 At this time, we have over 300 members of service deployed canvass, extending 1,000 feet out from the location. 
 Add another hundred uniforms, go river to river. 
 The Con Electric truck. 
 Nothing yet, sir. 
 I want it found. Yes, sir. 
 Department should be advised that the Feds are on board. 
 Good. I want the D.A.s in all five boroughs ready to expedite any paper we might need on warrants. 
 Any questions? 
 Let's get at it. 
 Sir, the, uh, family and the husband of the deceased are waiting for you in your office. 
 Okay. 
 LINDA:  Sorry I'm late, Sydney. 
 This is so terrible. I can't believe another cop has been killed. It's been all over the news. Yeah. That poor girl. I guess this is no night to go to  A Midsummer Night's Dream. Yeah, no. Shakespeare can wait. Always starts the same way. What do you mean? Well, the fanfare, the damn media'll be crawling all over this story like a pack of rats. Yeah, front page coverage for about a week. But, then you know what happens. I hope I never find out. The whole world moves , and the family is left suffer in obscurity. I can't imagine. They said she had a six-year-old son. Yeah. You know, the department will do what it can. The family will get a nice pension. She'll make the Wall of Heroes. Maybe they'll name a street after her. But the hurt... Well, that... that goes down the generations. How do you deal with the day-to-day, not knowing if Danny will come home? Every time I hear a cop has been shot... I hold my breath until I know Danny is okay. And even though I feel awful for the other family, God forgive me, (sniffles) I'm so relieved it's not my Danny. (siren chirping) (chuckles) (chuckles) All right. Thanks for coming in. Your fence give you anything good? No, ice came out of the clear blue sky. Not a whisper in the gemstone community. His guess? Stone's going out of the country. There's an ARGUS camera with a perfect view of the crime scene, only it didn't get anything. Come here. Look at this. It's at the same exact time as the 911 call. Yeah. Back that up. Hold on. How is it that the one street light in New York City that can block our camera view of the crime is being fixed? This guy just happens to come along ten minutes before the heist to fix it? You think it's a coincidence? No, no, there's 330,000 street lights in New York City. How do you know that? I dated an electrician. Local Three guy. Long story. Enlighten me some other time. I don't believe in coincidences, do you? No. Not on that scale. How does that happen, huh? 330,000 street lights in the city of New York, and you just happen to be fixing the one that messes up my day? What are the odds on that? You're a gambler. Who told you I gamble? Well, let's see. Your computer, your phone bills, your text messages, your e-mails, your credit cards, and your bank records-- look, I know every asinine thing you've done since the second grade, so don't play with me. I'm just a street light guy. Really? Says he's just a street light guy, this guy. Oh. Those are my kids. Uh-huh. Go ahead, touch it. Touch it. Come on. Touch it. How's it feel? Feel good? Well, you better learn to love it Why? Because that's the closest you're ever going to get to touching your kids again. Don't touch anything. You know what cop killers get? They get maximum security, which means no physical contact, so you don't touch anything. Cop killer? All I did was park my truck. Really? They killed a cop. And you helped them, so that makes you a cop killer, too. In fact, don't even look at me. Turn your head away from me. Now! Disgusting. I was in over my head to my bookie for 50 large. He said if I don't help him and his guys, he's going to kill me. I swear on my kids' eyes. These guys are savages. And? Who's your bookie? I give you these-- Don't look at me. I give you these guys, my life is not worth a plug nickel. Who's your bookie? Pick better friends next time. I talk, I want witness protection. Yes! Yes! What else can we do for you today, Andrew? Hey, jackass! Tell me who your bookie is! Ricky Vintano. DANNY: Ricky Vintano? Happy Jack Vintano's kid? Yeah, that's him. All clear! We just missed him. It's still cold. Let's go. Hey, I want you to get dumps on these computers forthwith. You got it, Danny. Go. I bet you Ricky winds up at his daddy's. Big tough guys do. FRANK: Detectives. Commissioner Reagan. Vintano leave anything behind that would tell us where he's going? We seized two computers. CCS will acquire the hard drives. We'll see what kind of trail this guy left us. We're also thinking of giving his old man Happy Jack a shake. Okay, well, I have three words for you: call my lawyer. Put him under 24-hour surveillance. The kid makes contact, we'll know about it. Yes, sir. They found the Con Electric truck abandoned in a parking lot over on West 51st. Crime Scene Garage going to start processing it. Let's see if this tells us anything. Family was in my office, Danny. I got to get this son of a bitch. I'll kick down every door this punk's ever walked through, Dad. I know you will. JACKIE: Sarge, we finally got somewhere on the camera footage. DANNY: This video came from a camera located outside of a nightclub on 5-1. It's halfway between the crime scene and where the perps dumped the Con Electric truck. DANNY: That is our boy Ricky Vintano making his getaway with the diamonds. Splitting up part of the plan? We're thinking Ricky he might have called an audible, went into business for himself. Well, either way, we still have to nail Ricky and his two pals, whether he's with them, or against them. Yeah, well, we've rounded up every heist guy left walking. We've torn through every known associate of Ricky Vintano. So far, we got squat. And we checked all the hospitals for a bleeder. We got nothing. Hey. You should check this guy out. We snagged him from one of Ricky Vintano's gambling joints. This is is Billy Leo. He tends bar for Ricky Vintano. Now, the problem with Billy is, he's on parole, and we found an eight ball of coke in his sock. Then... two ounces in his car. Tell them what you told me. (sighs) About a week ago, I'm closing up. Ricky comes in with two guys. Some Albanian I don't know, and the other guy it took me a minute to recognize. Why's that? It's been about 15 years. He's older. Looks like he's been gobbling steroids, but he's still short. It's Jimmy C. Jimmy Costello. DANNY: Johnny Fat's kid? Yeah. Him and Ricky Vintano, they've been best pals since growing up. Two brats with major Mob guys for fathers. Okay. This other guy with Costello, he's short, kind of stocky? No-- tall, six-two, built, foreign accent. Seemed like a very heavy guy to me. Is that it? That's all you got? I give you something, you going to throw me to the wolves? These guys scare me just sitting there and drinking, and I don't scare easy. (clears throat) We can't help you. Come on! I can't do the kind of time that comes with that weight. 
 
 Hey, you think you're scared of those guys? They just killed a cop. You don't know how scary that can make me. You want to walk on the coke? I need more. I need something real. I need something real and you ain't got nothing. When they left... I went to lock the door behind them. They got into a black Caddy. A rental. How did you know it was rented? 'Cause when the guy sat down, he put his keys on the bar. It was a car rental keychain. You know how many Caddies are rented in New York City right now? This is baloney. We ain't got time for this guy. It had New York plates. Started with M-A-L. You always remember license plates? Nah. It's my mother's initials. Jimmy Costello. Another wannabe son of a real gangster. He stabs a kid outside a bar up on Fordham Road. His old man sends him up to Montreal. Yeah, I remember that case. Didn't the witness to the stabbing OD on heroin? Uh-huh. But Jimmy stayed up in Montreal anyway, right? I guess word was Happy Jack banned him because he was too wild, but mostly just wanted to keep him away from Ricky. How ironic. Well, this Costello caught at least one bullet, and nothing's come up in our medical canvass; I doubt he's in any condition to travel. Yeah, well, if Ricky split with the diamonds, Jimmy and the Albanian are going to be looking for him, so he's probably still here. So we I.D.'d two out of three. We got Ricky Vintano and Jimmy Costello. Just need our shooter. Let's track down that black Caddy. See what it says. All right. I don't care what time. Keep me posted. Hey! Nicky! You got your hair cut. Now I can see your beautiful face. Thanks, Grandpa. I missed you so much. I missed you, too. How was the coast? San Francisco was amazing. Plus, we went to the Aquarium in Monterey. It's so much cooler than the one in Coney Island. Best time of my life. That's great. Of course, she's two weeks behind on her schoolwork. What? Hey, you're a Reagan. Get in the kitchen. Hit the books. Go on. She's been dying to see you. Yeah? I think you're stuck with the role of bad cop. (laughs): Yeah. Which is ironic, since I'm the only one in the family who isn't one. Hey, Francis. Yeah? Happy Jack Vintano's kid is the main suspect? Well, he ain't no Happy Jack. Jack used to run the numbers between Bay Ridge and Riverdale. Transports you, does it? Should I put on some Sinatra and Nat King Cole? (chuckles) Different day, different way to do business. "Business," he calls it. Yeah, Happy Jack used to be called "the good bad guy." I'm sure his victims felt differently. Give me some help here. Hey... You know the way the city used to be. I never had your appreciation for the gray area, Pop. Well, let me tell you something. Happy Jack wanted to hurt you, you probably had it coming. He was strictly a numbers and sports guy. No guns, no girls, no dope. A regular Mother Teresa. How was he with the lame and downtrodden. (stammering) The guy was a Marine in Korea. We were in the same unit, six months apart. He gave the commissioner a run for his money. He was a worthy adversary. But on a case like this, cop killed? Happy Jack Vintano was on our side. You remember when they killed Jimmy Farrell? Yeah. Nice kid. Airborne Ranger back from 'Nam. Chest full of medals. I went to see Vintano off the books. The mutt who killed Jimmy Farrell? Two days later, he showed up dead. Wrapped in a bow. Well... Nobody chased that case too hard. Good old days. HENRY: Maybe not. But let me tell you something. Unlike today, everyone knew where the line was... and what it cost... when you crossed it. (sighs) You know, Officer Martin joined the department right after seeing me speak at Syracuse. You know sometimes I think you blame yourself for Joe. Anytime a cop dies, it's like losing a member of the family. Don't forget he jumped out of bed every morning he was on the job. And everything I've heard about Officer Martin says she was the same way. Price of leadership inspiring people to their doom? No. You inspire people to do the right thing. The price is what we sometimes pay for the life we choose. I know all that. But thank you. This the surveillance video on Happy Jack Vintano? Yeah. This guy is the pork store, the cheese store, the bakery, the fishmonger... That's why they call him Happy Jack. He should have his own show on the Food Network. Makes me want to move to the Bronx, all that good food. He's a man of habit, but no sign of prodigal son Ricky. I almost feel bad for the old man. That's a maximum "almost"" I'm just saying, he was king of his own world. Now it's all passed him by. Hey, that Caddy, turns out it was rented outside of Buffalo by Jimmy Collins, AKA Costello. Nothing popped up on the LPR's, but it did pick up a ticket last night on Bruckner Boulevard. Want to check it out? I understand I can get some of the best sausage in the city here. So the food is lousy in Brooklyn these days? Brooklyn ain't what it used to be. Not much is. I see that kid of yours made out good. Matter of perspective. The kid now has my old job. It's better him than some creep off the street. You had a good run. Likewise. Come here, I'll show you something. This is beautiful. He grows the fennel and the chili peppers himself. He throws a little extra cold red wine into the mix. Reminds me of the stuff my father made in Calabria when I was a boy. Grazie. We were, uh... we were talking about my kid. I need to ask you about yours, Jack. I thought you were retired. I'm coming as a courtesy. You know, all that time and energy we spent trying to outsmart each other-- who runs the numbers now? You go to 7-Eleven, you bet a horse, the state'll take your money at the OTB. We were the bad guys. You know things change. The funny thing is, I can see that, but my kid... he's blind to it. You made it this far, alive and free. I mean, that's a million-to-one shot in your racket. I did, but now my son. I was never one of those morons that wanted their kids around this life. I don't know, is this how it goes, the sins of the father? You know better than most, Jack. A cop goes down, no quarter is given. DETECTIVE: Man, oh, man! You got Danny Reagan's cell phone number? DANNY: That's the partial plate. JACKIE: And there's the ticket. Think we should wait for a warrant? Nah. Can't you hear that person calling for help? JACKIE: Oh, yeah. Ooh. Pop the trunk. Oh! Think we found Jimmy. JACKIE: Yeah. Too late. Yeah. That Officer Martin was something else, huh? Mortally wounded, and still had the wherewithal to put a slug in this creep. Nice piece of shooting-- I just wish she would've gotten to him first. Did he bleed out? I don't think he had time-- look at his neck. Classic manual strangulation markings-- crushed larynx. The guy was choked to death. Oh, don't tell me-- no honor among thieves. I'm shocked. And my mother complains about  her  retirement package. Ricky better hope we get to him before his partner does. DANNY: As long as we get the shooter, I don't give a damn what they do to Ricky Vintano. Perps were picked up on this camera on 5th Avenue located right near the crime scene. The time stamp is two days before the officer was killed. They're casing the place-- so who's our shooter? JACKIE: This third guy. We sent his picture to Interpol. They believe it's Dukajan Kola, AKA Monster. He's a high-stakes jewel thief, an ethnic Albanian from Montenegro. How's he tie in to Vintano and Costello? Interpol believes he's hiding out in Montreal where he hooked up with Jimmy C. This guy Kola's a real piece of work. He's wanted for a home invasion outside of Montreal with five bodies attached to it. He shot and killed a family of four. Fifth body was his partner. Which means he doesn't like to share. No. Also means he's not gonna leave New York City without his diamonds. Let's find Vintano before his partner does. You got an extra pair of collar stars? I can't find mine. How was your trip to the Bronx? (groans) Are you gonna bang a guy for trying to pitch in? Your pal Happy Jack knows enough to use throwaway cell phones but not enough to know we have shotgun mikes that can pick up a conversation two blocks away. Which is what TARU did three minutes after you left. So? So he called his son. He's trying to  save  his son. Which is exactly what we would be doing. We? (sighs) So send in the Marines next time. You know what the press will do with this? How are they gonna find out? Happy Jack gonna post it on his "blob"? You think NYPD's the only agency watching Vintano? (chuckles) Oh, I get it, I get it. You're worried your senior citizen father is going to embarrass you. My worry is, you may have cut off our only avenue to a cop killer. Okay. Okay, okay. (resumes brushing) (sighs) Maybe I shouldn't have gone and seen Vintano. But the only way you're gonna get this kid is if Happy Jack reels him in. (bagpipes playing "Amazing Grace") FRANK:  Monsignor Moran, Mr. Mayor... Mr. and Mrs. Martin, John... Vincent. Back in the days when the city first formed the police department, the poet Walt Whitman wrote: "I dreamed in a dream I saw a city "invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the Earth." As a New York City police officer who worked the city streets every day, Officer Michelle Martin knew, better than most, that the dream has not yet been realized. But Officer Martin endeavored to make the dream a reality. She was devoted... she was true... she was brave. And she made a choice. She chose to live a life of service. She chose to put herself in harm's way, to be a guardian to the people of this great city. (bagpipes playing) We will never be able to thank Officer Martin. She made the supreme sacrifice. But this we can... and will do. We will remember her always. We will remember that even when mortally wounded, she had the strength and composure to return fire. We will remember that in her life and in her death... she embodied all that we, as citizens, can hope to be. (voice breaks): May God bless M... May God bless Michelle and welcome her home. (bagpipes playing) ♪ ♪ DANNY: Funeral was tough. Tell me you got some good news for me. I got some news that's gonna cheer you up. Here. Hop in. I'll change in the back. Okay. All right, listen to this-- this just came in. Ricky called his father. RICKY: Uh, Dad, I'm all banged up, I got nowhere to go. (HAPPY JACK) Ricky, the cops are listening. You gotta turn yourself in. It's the only way. Can we locate where the call originated? Yeah, it came in from Parkchester. The RTC just called, said Vintano did a bit up in Greenhaven. What's Parkchester? Didn't-- Ricky had a cell mate when he was in Greenhaven from Parkchester, right, a Shawn something? Shawn Randolph. Yeah, got compassionate parole in '98. Had liver cancer, died three months later. Right, but he's dead. That's why we scratched him off the list of known associates for Ricky. So who's in Parkchester? His ex Lori Kent still resides there. She made half a dozen visits up to Greenhaven-- get this-- after Randolph croaked. So Shawn's ex was visiting Ricky in prison? Wow, ain't love grand? Don't look, I got to do my pants. (unzips) Body wasn't even cold yet, this tomato jumps horses. Yeah, well, let's pay the merry widow a visit, huh? Don't make me do anything you're gonna regret. Put your hands on the dashboard. Put 'em on the dashboard before I put a bullet in you! It's my lucky day, Ricky. I got you before the bad guys did. Yeah. Keep smiling. RICKY: Lawyer, lawyer, lawyer! Lawyer! Your lawyer can't help you now. You're a cop killer. Even your old man can't help you. Hey, my dad had nothing to do with this, all right? Reagan, Reagan, what are we doing here? Yeah, what are we doing? Shut up! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Listen to me, listen to me. Step aside, Jackie. Listen, just listen... Jackie. Listen to me. This whole case, you haven't said anything about your brother Joe, and I know it is probably killing you, but do not do anything stupid. Listen to me. We worked together what, three, four years back in the day, Jack? Good partner. You always had my back. Do me a favor. Watch it one more time, okay? Come on. Get out. Let's go. Come on. Come on! Get up. Get up, get up. Move. I said move. (groans) You know what happened in this spot on July 13, 1975? 1975-- I was two. Yeah? Your old man killed a guy, shot him twice in the back of the head. Bang, bang. You're crazy. Yeah, you want to know what happened next? Nothing. You want to know why? 'Cause your old man killed a guy that the whole city wanted dead. Yeah, Happy Jack killed a cop killer. Yeah, so? So? So now you're a cop killer, Ricky. Huh? Yeah. You've become the thing that even your old man knew had to be wiped out. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't? Well, how about I spell it out for you? The last time a cop killer was brought here, they pulled him out of the river with two bullet holes in the back of his head and they still ruled it a suicide. You starting to get the drift, Ricky, huh? I'll give you the diamonds, man, I'll give you the... I don't want the diamonds! You killed a cop! All I did was drive, bro. Yeah? Wrong answer. So now I'm gonna give you a choice, Ricky. You're going to give me the shooter or I'm gonna do what Happy Jack did. I'm gonna put two bullets... (gun cocks) ...in the back of a cop killer's head. The shooter, Ricky. Give me the shooter! Hey. Monster. What? Monster-- they call him Monster. His name is Kola. There's a warehouse over by the Manhattan Bridge. (sirens wailing) That cop-killing animal still in there? Yeah, he's in there. Perimeter is locked down. There's only one way out. Come on, come on. (OFFICER over radio): Here we go. (gunfire) ♪ ♪ Now I can sleep. Renzulli! You brought your cute lawyer friend with you again. Oh, yeah. What's he got to say now? Actually, ma'am, I'm pretty much speechless. You know, for once, uh, so am I, Alice. (chuckles) (snorts) I see Danny made the case. Ah... the silent treatment. You know, you're just like your mother. That was the trouble with the Reillys-- stoics. The Reagans-- we punch walls, we throw a few back, we howl at the moon. My mom, your wife, could do more with a look than a thousand punches. Say what you will, but I never knew a Reagan to take a heart attack. Reillys-- all that holding it in, sooner or later you're going to explode.

The reason they have "retired" stamped on those I.D.'s in such big letters is to make sure guys like you don't forget that they put their papers in. How's dinner, boys? Good. Good. I tell you, these meatballs ain't bad. Italian feast night at the Reagans. One good thing that came out of Pop's trip up to Arthur Avenue. To visit his good bad guy buddy. Keep it up, I'll call social services and report elder abuse. I know it's boring, but these days the bad guys are usually just plain old bad guys. You know, you have a very, very limited view on things. Oh, this coming from the family philosopher. Yeah, that's right. Oh, I'm not making excuses for the guy. LINDA: Well, I don't see crime going away anytime soon. I mean, read the papers. Let's hope not-- every one of us would be out of a job. Yeah. Yeah, but I'd still rather deal with the likes of Vintano. At least there's some logic to what he did. What's the kid facing? Well, he gave us the shooter, so... Not enough time-- that's what he's facing. ERIN: He's not Sammy the Bull. It's five years, witness protection, and an onerous lifetime probation. He spits on a sidewalk, it's bye-bye, Ricky. He got off easy. That's one thing that has changed. Back in the day, you could set one of those Mob guys on fire, they still wouldn't talk. Ever try that, Grandpa? Danny... I'm joking. I'm joking! It was the good old days. Yeah, like, nowadays, these so-called Mobsters are all singing like, uh, what's her name? Lady Goo-Gah. (all laughing) Grandpa also picked up some good-looking cannoli. LINDA: Leave the gun. Keep the cannoli. No, leave the gun, take the cannoli. (all laughing)
