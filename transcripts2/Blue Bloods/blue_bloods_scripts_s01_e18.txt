 You're either worried about me, or you need something. 
 Oh... you think you got me all figured out, don't you, Danny Reagan? 
 Actually, I just called to tell you that I love you. 
 Oh... I love you, too, babe. 
 And I need you to bring me home some milk. 
 See? I knew it. I knew you needed something. What else? 
 Um, an eight-to-four tour would be nice. 
 Okay, I'll work on it.

 Yeah, Dad. 
 FRANK: You're amped up, Danny. 
 If the EMTs are still around, have them check your blood pressure. 
 Look, I'm not amped up, Dad, okay? 
 A kid just died in my arms. I'm pissed off. 
 That's my point. 
 I got no bullet holes in me, okay, Dad? 
 Just please tell the family I'm fine. 
 Don't worry, don't call me, don't check up on me. 
 I got to deal with this, all right? 
 I'll take care of it. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 (phone beeps off) 
 He's okay. 
 I know  he's  okay. 
 It's you I'm worried about, now. 
 I wasn't the one dodging bullets tonight. 
 You know what I mean, Francis. 
 Danny's involved in a shooting. 
 I know where your mind went. 
 I hit up Saint Mike on a daily basis, to make sure you never have to go through that again. 
 Well, tell him thank you for looking after my oldest tonight. 
 I was asleep. 
 I was sleeping and my baby was lying dead downstairs in the streets. 
 Well, we're very sorry for your loss, ma'am. 
 Mrs. Taylor, I know this is very difficult for you, but do you have any idea if David had any enemies, or problems with... 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 This neighborhood, this time of night. 
 But David isn't into drugs or anything like that. 
 He's a good son. 
 He teaches children with learning disabilities and autism. 
 All we want to do is find out who did this to your son, ma'am. 
 Maybe it was an accident. 
 Maybe so. 
 Uh, did you happen to know where David was going tonight? 
 MRS. TAYLOR: I was sleeping. 
 I have an early shift at the hospital. 
 I'm a nurse's aide. 
 Mom. Mom? Mom? 
 Sir... 
 I got here as soon as I could. 
 Oh! 
 That's all right, honey. It's all right. 
 (Mrs. Taylor whines) 
 That's all right, Mom. 
 Everything's going to be okay. I'm here. 
 These are detectives. 
 They just wanted to ask me some questions. 
 Mark Taylor, David's brother. 
 Detective Reagan. 
 This is my partner, Detective Curatola. 
 I'm very sorry for your loss. 
 Do you have any idea if your brother had any problems with anyone? 
 No. No, I don't. 
 My brother is dead. Please. 
 Look at my poor mother. 
 She needs some time, okay? 
 Of course. 
 Okay. We'll talk another time. 
 But, uh, look, here's my card, if you think of anything. 
 Thank you. 
 MRS. TAYLOR: Detective? 
 This is David's favorite sweatshirt. - Mom. 
 Mom. - Can you see to it that they put it on him? 
 I don't want him to get cold. 
 It's okay. 
 Of course we'll see to it, ma'am. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. I'm here. Okay. 
 DANNY:  Everything about this shooter, Jack... 
 the way he was dressed, the pricey vehicle, even the way he shot David Taylor. 
 It's not his first barbecue. 
 And the vic's phone dumps... they're leading me nowhere. 
 Yeah, same here. 
 I got every felony arrest in the victim's precinct and surrounding matching the shooter's description. 
 I'm coming up with squat. 
 What about the Gang Unit collars? Want me to check them? 
 I already did it. You know what, check Summons Tracking for parking violations on Hummers. 
 It's not a very common vehicle for that area. 
 That's a good idea. 
 I mean, these guys aren't likely to fill the meters and obey, uh, alternate side street parking rules. 
 Bingo. 
 What do you got? 
 Um... last three digits of the license plate match. 
 That's our vehicle. 
 Who's it registered to? 
 Uh... 
 The Peru Helps Foundation. 
 Let's see what that is. 
 DANNY: That's the guy. 
 Where? 
 That's the... right there. 
 That's the shooter. 
 JACKIE: "Peru Businessman Harlem's Savior. 
 "Raymundo Salazar, a self-described philanthropist, "but with suspected ties to South American drug cartel, "donated a million dollars to the Harlem Regeneration Project." 
 I don't know any saviors that carry Glocks and shoot kids in cold blood. That guy is the shooter. 
 Raymundo Salazar is a Peruvian drug lord. 
 He runs the El Mal crew, which is the largest cocaine smuggling pipeline into New York. 
 The DEA estimates his take is $400,000 per week. 
 (knocking on door) 
 That's a lot of overtime. 
 Hi. Thank you for coming. 
 This is Lyle Greene, Special Narcotics Prosecutor... 
 This is my brother, Danny. 
 Lyle is, um, very familiar with Salazar. 
 Very familiar, and very unsuccessful. 
 Salazar's still on the street. 
 And subtlety is not his strong suit. 
 Must run in the family. 
 Salazar has been on our radar since over a year ago, when cheap Peruvian powder starting flooding the city. 
 We haven't been able to directly link him to the drug supply. 
 And we've never found a witness willing to testify against him. 
 I guess today's your lucky day, then. 
 Our Peruvian counterparts tell us he has a history of torturing and killing potential witnesses in his home country. 
 This was the body of a lieutenant in his organization who agreed to testify against Salazar. 
 He was killed, in broad daylight, in Lima, by one of Salazar's men. 
 Not a single witness would come forward. 
 Until now. 
 You sure it was him? 
 It was him. 
 It was dark. You were under fire. 
 I just told you. It was him. 
 That's how Salazar's lawyers are going to go after you on the stand, if you find him. 
 I'll find him. 
 He's constantly on the move. 
 He never stays more than one night in the same place. 
 He changes his addresses and vehicles like underwear. 
 I tell you what. When I lock his ass up, I'll know exactly where to find him. 
 Is that the DEA transcripts and tracking data? 
 Right. All here. 
 You know the one thing I can't figure out? 
 Is why a kingpin like Salazar would go to the effort of doing a hit on a clean kid like David Taylor? 
 I mean, wouldn't he use one of his gang to do it? 
 ERIN: Well, there is a connection. 
 According to the DEA, Mark Taylor, the victim's brother, was suspected of funneling money from El Mal into money market accounts on Wall Street. 
 But we never found proof of that. 
 Keep me posted. 
 Thank you. 
 Look, I know what you're going to say. 
 I'll be nicer next time. 
 No, I like that you don't sugarcoat anything. 
 It's refreshing after a full day of lawyers. 
 What I wanted to say was... 
 I'm glad you're okay. 
 Aw... Sis. See? 
 I knew all that playing Superman as kids would work out. 
 I'm bulletproof still. 
 Yeah, well, Salazar thinks he's bulletproof, too. 
 Be careful. 
 I will. 
 Thanks for coming down, Mr. Taylor. 
 We've identified the person who killed your brother. 
 Who was it? 
 Raymundo Salazar. 
 We'd like for you to help us find him. 
 We have been checking out his known haunts, and we're coming up dry. 
 I'm sorry. I don't, uh, I don't know who that is. 
 Yes, you do. 
 You launder money for him. 
 (chuckles) 
 No, I don't. 
 Yeah, you do. What happened, your Wall Street bonuses weren't enough for you? 
 If you had any proof, the SEC would already have my license and I would be in jail. 
 Come on, Mark, this guy's a major drug kingpin who killed your brother, a clean kid. 
 Why would he do that if it wasn't personal, hmm? 
 If it was personal, then it probably had something to do with you. 
 What were you doing, Mark, stealing money from Salazar? 
 No! 
 You know, I watched him kill your brother. 
 Your brother died in my arms. 
 Hey, look at me. 
 You gonna let this guy get away with that? 
 You gonna help us find his killer? 
 Look, I don't know why Raymundo Salazar killed my brother. 
 Yes, you do. 
 Look, then just tell us where to find him. 
 If he knew I told you anything, he would kill me, too. 
 Do the right thing, Mark. 
 You don't want to do it for us, you don't want to do it for your dead brother, do it for your brokenhearted mother, okay? 
 Tell us where to find him. 
 When he comes to New York, Salazar, sometimes he stays with a girlfriend in Harlem. 
 Her name is Sylvia. 
 Where do we find this Sylvia? 
 She works at a barbershop on 125th Street. 
 Sylvia, police. Keep walking. 
 I need to ask you some questions about your boyfriend Raymundo Salazar. 
 Never heard of him. 
 Maybe I'll refresh your memory. Get in the car. 
 Come on, get inside. 
 Come on. Scoot over. 
 All right, Raymundo Salazar. 
 I never seen him before. 
 Oh, you never seen him. 
 No. 
 Okay, well, maybe you've seen some of his victims, like this guy. 
 He was doused in gasoline and set on fire. 
 And then there's this guy, he was buried alive. 
 Maybe you've seen his latest victim, David Taylor. 
 Oh, you know him? 
 No. 
 Really? 
 Salazar shot him in the chest, killed him. 
 Strange, but when David died in my arms the other night, he had the same bracelet on as you. 
 What a coincidence. 
 Did he give you that bracelet? 
 So you and David Taylor are together? 
 You tell us about it here or we're gonna have to take you down to the station, you can tell us there. 
 We'll take her down to the station. 
 SYLVIA: No. 
 (engine starting) 
 Wait. 
 No, no, no, we're going to the station. 
 I met David a few months ago at a party, at his brother's place. 
 Mark Taylor. 
 Started talking and told him I want to get my GED. 
 He started tutoring me. 
 He's really sweet. 
 So cute, you know? 
 He's so funny. 
 You ever meet someone like that? 
 Someone you just want to be with all the time? 
 Yeah, I married her. So what happened? 
 Salazar find out about you and David? 
 Yeah. He started asking questions about David. 
 Told him he was just tutoring me, but told me not to see him anymore. 
 And did you? 
 No. 
 (horn blaring nearby) 
 Couldn't. 
 Thought we could keep it a secret, but... 
 (sobbing) 
 Can't keep secrets from a guy like Salazar. 
 Why don't you tell us where we could find him? 
 You know what he would do to me? 
 He would... 
 I know what he did to David Taylor. 
 What do you think, you're gonna get a free pass from him? No. 
 (sobbing): Please, please. 
 Listen, I watched him kill David. 
 I'm gonna testify against Salazar in a court of law. 
 I'm gonna put his ass away for the rest of his life so you won't have to look over your shoulder for the rest of yours. 
 Okay. 
 You gotta tell us where we could find him. 
 Lupino is his lieutenant. 
 He called the shop today to make an appointment for Salazar. 
 He's scheduled to come in tomorrow at 10:00. 
 Okay. 
 You guys finish your homework first,  then come down. 
 What's for dessert, babe? 
 You know what I noticed about you tonight? 
 What, that I look incredibly handsome? 
 You change the subject every time I bring up Raymundo Salazar. 
 Who? Very funny. You can joke all you want, but no one has ever testified against him. 
 And if they try, he has them killed before they get a chance. 
 Look, honey, you gotta stop believing everything you read in the newspapers, okay? 
 And he's on the FBI's Most Wanted list. 
 And guess who's on my most wanted list right now? 
 What? 
 Forget it. 
 You can't be serious! 
 Look, all right, I'm sorry, okay? 
 I just don't want you to worry about me. 
 I got enough people worried about me already. 
 Look, I'm testifying against him. 
 I watched this guy kill an innocent kid in cold blood. 
 I'm gonna testify. 
 You know, this is not some... corner drug dealer we're talking about. 
 Well, since we're on the subject, you know if we grab him up, I'm probably gonna have to send you and the boys over to Dad's for a couple days, just for safety. 
 Are you serious? 
 What do you want me to do? 
 It's a precaution. 
 When? 
 Tomorrow, so you should probably start packing tonight. 
 I don't like this. 
 I don't like it either! 
 Look, what do you want me to do? 
 Just think of it as like a nice midweek vacation for you and the boys, okay? 
 You'll have fun. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 I'm gonna have a blast. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What am I gonna do with you? 
 Mmm, I can think of a lot of things you can do with me right now. 
 Don't worry. 
 It's gonna be all right. 
 Hey. Police. Let's go. 
 Put your hands up against the wall. 
 Let's go. 
 Raymundo Salazar, change of plans, buddy. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You're under arrest for the murder of David Taylor. 
 Good thing you missed me. 
 Nice haircut, by the way. Let's go. 
 Hey, babe. No, everything's going according to plan. 
 There's two detectives at the boys' school. 
 Right after dismissal, they'll pick 'em up and bring 'em over to the place I told ya. 
 We're gonna proceed with your pickup the same way we did in the '06 case, all right? 
 I got it. 
 You got nothing to worry about. 
 Hey, I love you. 
 I love you, too. I'll check in later. 
 Yeah. 
 You almost done with this mutt's pedigree? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a shame to waste your time and you paper. 
 I not gonna be here long. 
 Mmm, ice in his veins, this one. 
 Yeah, and you know what for brains. 
 You're going down for A1 felony, bub. 
 Take him downtown, Jack. 
 Yep. 
 We'll see. 
 We'll see? 
 You know, you might be able to intimidate the rest of your witnesses, but you won't intimidate me. 
 Well, well, well. 
 Looks like you made a friend. 
 I try. What's up? 
 I wanted you to know I'm convening the grand jury on Friday to get an indictment. 
 I need you to be there. 
 Two days? I'm impressed. 
 It'll be the first time we've been able to make charges stick. 
 Yeah, well, maybe you're a little bit worried that Salazar may try to have me killed. Coffee? 
 Salazar... I don't put anything past that animal. 
 Well, that animal has never run into a Reagan before. 
 FRANK: Good afternoon. Thanks for coming. 
 The New York City Police Department is announcing the capture and arrest of alleged drug kingpin Raymundo Salazar. 
 He was taken into custody without incident this morning by NYPD detectives and is being held pending indictment for the murder of David Taylor. 
 Questions? John. 
 Commissioner, rumors are that the arresting officer was your son Daniel Reagan; That he was involved in a gun battle with the suspect, and is your eyewitness. Will you confirm? 
 No. 
 The El Mal crew has a history of witness intimidation. 
 Does that concern you? 
 No. 
 When can we expect an indictment? 
 I'll take that. 
 Special Narcotics prosecutor Lyle Greene. 
 First of all, I want to thank the New York City Police Department for their excellent work in apprehending Mr. Salazar. 
 As to the indictment, we expect that after Detective Reagan testifies before the grand jury Friday afternoon, they will vote to indict swiftly and surely. 
 That's all for today. Thank you. 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 (reporters shouting questions) 
 Your grandstanding for a sound bite just confirmed our witness's name. 
 I apologize. 
 I can understand you're sensitive... it's your son. 
 I'm always sensitive when my people are put in harm's way. 
 The guy from  Dia Noticias  all but announced it. 
 And where did that come from? 
 It didn't come from my people. 
 You got a leak. 
 Ready to go? 
 Yeah, one sec. 
 Here, let me help you. 
 Thanks. 
 What precinct do you guys normally work out of? 
 Midtown usually. 
 Oh, yeah? North or South? 
 North. 
 Up on 67th, right? 
 Yeah, that's it. 
 You know what? 
 I think I forgot my wallet. 
 (grunting) 
 (muffled yelling) 
 (muffled scream) 
 (grunts) 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Oh. M.E. Just released the autopsy. 
 Uh... a 9mm slug was sent to ballistics. 
 Well, my eye-wit or not, I'd sure like to have that gun. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right. Just brung up Salazar's right-hand man Jorge Lupino. 
 He was arrested in 2009 
 for Assault One. Huh. 
 Guess what the result was? 
 Witness recanted. 
 (gasps) 
 Surprise, surprise. 
 (phone rings) 
 Reagan. 
 What do you mean? 
 Nah. No, I'll call her. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. 
 Everything good? 
 Yeah, should be. 
 (phone line ringing) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hello, Detective. 
 Who's this? 
 This is your worst nightmare. 
 Come on. Put Lin on the phone. 
 She's not available right now, and won't be until you decide not to testify against Salazar in the grand jury hearing. 
 Who is this? 
 Let me speak to my wife right now. 
 She's kind of pretty. 
 Keep her that way. 
 And, amigo, don't try to find her, or we'll know about it. 
 If you hurt one hair on her head, I promise you... 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 (sighs) 
 (low moan) 
 HENRY: Nothing like a grilled cheese sandwich on a chilly night. 
 What did you tell the kids when you picked them up? 
 Nothing. 
 
 
 
 Hey. Where's Sean and Jack? 
 In doing homework. 
 Don't worry. They don't know anything? 
 Daddy! Daddy! 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Daddy! Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Daddy, great-grandpa picked us up with two men in a cop car! 
 Yeah? 
 That's great. 
 Well, I used to have your grandpa's job, remember. 
 I just thought it would be fun for them. 
 JACK: Where's Mom? 
 Um, Mom's going to stay at a spa tonight, boys. 
 It's an early birthday gift. JACK: Oh. 
 That way it can be boys' night out. 
 Just you guys, okay? 
 Well, when is she coming back? 
 Jack, I have a feeling you know where I hide the video games. 
 I do, Grandpa. 
 Well, I'm feeling generous tonight. 
 You got exactly one hour. 
 Let's go! Come on! Let's go! 
 Come on, Sean! Run! 
 (sighs) 
 What's wrong? 
 They got Linda, Dad. 
 (phone line ringing) 
 LINDA (on recording): Hi. This is Linda. 
 Please leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks. 
 (beep) 
 This is Detective Daniel Reagan. 
 I want proof of life. 
 You're going to call me back and put my wife Linda on the phone and let me speak to her, or I promise you, your boss is going down. 
 And then I'm gonna come and I'm gonna find you. 
 And I'm gonna rip your friggin' heart right out of your chest, do you understand me? 
 Hey dad. Wat's going on? 
 Thanks for coming. 
 Yeah. 
 Erin's going to join us. 
 Oh. 
 Want something to eat? 
 No. I'm good. I got to get back. 
 Here she is. 
 Something's happened? 
 They have Linda. 
 What about the boys? 
 They're safe. 
 They're with Pop. 
 What are we going to do? 
 Well, it is, um... my considered opinion that if this gets out, if the media gets ahold of it, she won't have much of a chance. 
 JACKIE:  I don't understand. 
 Is there something I'm not getting? 
 I'm failing to understand why we're even here. 
 I need to have a conversation with the guy, that's all. 
 About what? I mean, what didn't we cover when we were speaking to him yesterday? 
 I need to talk to him alone. 
 (beeping) 
 Why do you need to talk to him at all? 
 I'll be a minute. 
 Where is she? 
 Who? 
 My wife. 
 You want to play dumb, huh? 
 Well, I came to make you a promise. 
 I will get on that stand tomorrow and I will testify, and you will spend the rest of your life in prison. 
 When I'm done with you, I'm going to round up the rest of the El Mal crew, and I'm gonna spread the word that Raymundo Salazar cooperated, and I think you know what's going to happen to you after that. 
 You're playing a very dangerous game, Detective. 
 I'm not playing. 
 (pounds twice on door) 
 (beeping) 
 You want to tell me what's going on? 
 You bring me here, and then you leave me standing outside. 
 You look like hell. 
 I don't even know what we're doing here. 
 And now you're going to testify against this guy tomorrow. 
 What is happening? 
 Yeah. 
 Talk to me. 
 I'll tell you outside.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Sir, here's the material you requested. 
 Did TARU isolate the phone dumps from the throwaway phones? 
 Yes, sir. 
 And this is all calls, incoming and outgoing, from the phone we confiscated from Salazar at his arrest. 
 This is cross-referenced data from all known associates. 
 And this is all pertinent data from all personnel involved in the Salazar case. 
 Thank you. 
 Rest of the schedule, Councilman Singer at 16:00. 
 Chiefs' briefing at 16:45, and DCPI at... 
 Danny's wife's been taken. 
 I'll clear the schedule, sir. 
 (sighs) 
 (door closes) 
 Hi. Anything? 
 I spoke to three El Mals, all doing major time. 
 They gave me a few addresses, but none of them panned out. 
 Although, one of them did confirm our suspicion. 
 Salazar's definitely getting information from somebody in the inside. 
 He doesn't know who it is, though. 
 This guy thinks it might be a cop. He doesn't know. 
 Oh, I hate to think that. 
 You got anything? 
 Well, uh... working on the cell report. 
 Your first call to Linda pinged off a tower near the Third Avenue Bridge. 
 Okay. 
 The second call, the FDR tower in Harlem. 
 Trouble is, we lost the ping. 
 Knowing Linda, it's probably her cell phone battery died. 
 We're narrowing it down, Reagan. 
 I know. 
 Hey, what are you guys working on? 
 You never seem to go home. 
 You checking up on us? 
 Easy, I'm just making conversation. 
 Make it somewhere else. 
 (sighs) 
 I know this is a stupid question, but are you okay? 
 Yeah. No. 
 We're going to figure it out, okay? 
 I know. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Yeah, Dad. 
 They found the Hummer under the 59th Street Bridge. 
 And, Danny, there's a body in the car. 
 An unideifified female. 
 I'm on my way. 
 They found a body, a female, under the 59th Street Bridge. 
 Okay, okay. I'll drive. 
 Car's ready, sir. 
 Danny. 
 It's not her! It's not Linda. 
 Dad, are you sure? 
 I'm sure. 
 You okay? - Yeah Alright. 
 Preliminary indicates Sylvia Montoya. 
 Okay. 
 Salazar's girlfriend. 
 Yeah. 
 She's the one that led us to him. 
 I'm thinking it wasn't enough for him to kill her lover. He had to see her dead, too. 
 Oh, God. 
 HENRY: All these cell phone records. 
 People waste half their life on the phone. 
 We need to ask TARU to make a subset of where all these throwaway phones are sold. 
 FRANK: - Hello. 
 In here. 
 How's Danny? 
 I sent him back to the station to try to get some sleep. 
 As if any of us can. 
 There's a mountain of stuff here. 
 They got to have someone on the inside. 
 Erin had a good idea, but it went right over my head. 
 Something about where these phones were purchased. 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 Hey. Thought you went home. 
 Thought  you  went home. 
 You need to eat. 
 Chinese food, huh? 
 Yeah WOMAN: Good morning, Commissioner. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 (clears throat) 
 Well, you know how much I like working on cars? 
 How's mine, by the way? 
 Perfect. 
 Anyway, I got the Five's from last night, and there was all this stuff in there about the Hummer, right? 
 Car was completely tricked out. 
 Bulletproof armor, hidden drop boxes and hydraulic trapdoors. 
 Very high-end stuff. 
 Where would somebody go to get that kind of work done? 
 Most of the small body shops, they just... 
 Here's your coffee. 
 Thanks, Mary. 
 They just build these traps in the natural cavieses of a car, but this kind of work can cost 50 grand. 
 Out of all five boroughs, it came back down to one shop. 
 They trick out vehicles for celebrities, rappers, and my guess would be high-end drug dealers. 
 Does Danny know? 
 Yeah, he does now. 
 That's detective-level police work, Officer Reagan. 
 Thought you were working a tour today. 
 I called in sick, Commissioner. 
 (laughs) 
 MAN:  I don't know who  customized that car. It wasn't me. 
 Oh, it was you. The Hummer was tricked out here, and you're the guy who tricked it out. 
 Now tell me where you dropped off the Hummer. 
 Look, I'd give up an address if I were you. 
 I got work to do. 
 Well, I got work to do. 
 What are you doing, man? You could blind me for life. 
 You're gonna tell me where you dropped the Hummer, or I'm gonna torch you and this whole damn place. 
 What, are you, crazy? 
 Yes, he is. 
 Tell me! 
 I didn't drop it off anyplace. 
 This is El Mal! They don't give you an address and a phone number! 
 Not good enough!! 
 Tell me where you dropped off the Hummer. 
 Look, okay, okay, stop, man, stop! Look. 
 Look, I delivered a trapped-out Benz for those people up in Harlem. 
 Some grungy squat. 
 36 West 128th. 
 Come on. 
 I find out you're lying, I'm coming back to finish the job. 
 We got a good address in Harlem. 
 I'll have ESU and a bus standing by. 
 If it looks good, execute the raid. 
 Three, two, one. Go. 
 (officers shouting) 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 Where's my wife? 
 Look, she's not here, man. 
 I said, where is she? 
 Against the wall. Go ahead. 
 (sighs) 
 2064 Fifth Avenue, all right? 
 I got an address, Jack. Somebody cuff him. 
 Come on. 
 (door creaks) 
 (grunts) 
 (grunting) 
 Linda?! 
 Linda?! 
 (muffled groaning) 
 I got him. I got him. 
 Come on! 
 (muffled shouts) 
 OFFICER: Second floor clear. 
 Is anyone else in here? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 (groans) 
 Okay, baby. 
 Oh, Danny. 
 It's all right. 
 Okay. Oh. 
 (sighs) 
 On your stomach. Turn over. 
 Turn over! Hands behind your back! 
 Are you okay? I'm okay. 
 You promise? Yeah. 
 Did they hurt you? No. 
 I knew you would find me. 
 I know you would. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm sorry to have inconveninced our panel. 
 It seems our witness is a no-show. 
 Mr. Salazar, in light of the fact the State can't produce a weapon or any physical evidence linking you to the murder, we have no choice 
 (door opens) 
 but to release... 
 Sorry. My apologies for being late. 
 Detective Reagan, witness to the murder of David Taylor. 
 You wanted to see me, Commissioner? 
 Thanks for coming. 
 You know my daughter Erin. 
 Hi, Lyle. 
 Please, sit down. 
 Erin and I were going out to dinner to celebrate. 
 Great thing for the NYPD and the DA's office, this indictment. 
 Yeah, there will be many indictments out of this investigation. 
 You know, sometimes, Lyle, I am just so proud of my daughter. 
 But I'm getting ahead of myself. Erin? 
 See, there were phone calls made with your throwaway phones. 
 What throwaway phones? 
 The ones that you bought at Bleecker Street Electronics right around the corner from your apartment. 
 FRANK: You were smart and paid cash, but the owner ID'd you. 
 He must be mistaken. 
 Well, see, we found the store because we noticed most of the phone calls to and from Salazar and his crew were from throwaway phones sold at one location. 
 Then we noticed the proximity to you. 
 And then, we concentrated on you, Lyle. 
 You were the mole. 
 FRANK: Oh, we'll get an indictment, Lyle. 
 And then, when we go to trial, we'll produce a key witness against you... Raymundo Salazar. 
 ERIN: Yeah, because once he finds out you can't help him anymore, he's going to trade you in like a used car. 
 I'm leaving. 
 Lyle Greene, you're under arrest for bribe receiving and official misconduct. 
 Would you like to do the honors, sweetheart? 
 Sure. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. 
 You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have that attorney present during questioning. 
 If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed to you. 
 I make a mean coleslaw, but I can't touch this concoction by Tilden's. 
 I can't identify the mystery ingredient. 
 Probably sugar. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Where's Mom and Dad? 
 Well, I guess they're late. 
 I miss Mom. 
 You've been a real trooper, Sean. 
 You, too, Jack. 
 (door closes) 
 DANNY: Hey, we're here. 
 HENRY: Hey. Mommy. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 There they are. 
 Welcome back. 
 Hey, Aunt Linda. 
 I missed you, Mommy. 
 How was your time at the spa? 
 My time at the spa was... fabulous. 
 Those mud baths are awesome. 
 I'm really glad to see you, Mom. 
 You said it, kid. 
 Hey guys, we've only got a small window for this fish and chips. 
 Otherwise, it's gonna be cold batter and soggy fries. 
 Mommy, Grandpa let us stay up until midnight. and play video games. 
 What? 
 Hey! What did I tell you guys? 
 Whatever happens with Grandpa has to stay with Grandpa. 
 FRANK: I would uh, like to say something. 
 Uh... I don't want to get corny but I would just like to day that uhm... 
 I feel very lucky to have you all here. 
 And I know your mother, your grandmother, would feel the same way. 
 I know people don't make time for this kind of thing nowadays but, uh... 
 I'm glad we do. 
 Family's what makes us strong. 
 (Linda chuckles softly) 
 And, Linda... 
 I'm glad you had a nice time at the spa. 
 Why, thank you. 
 And I thought you might like to say grace. 
 Bless us, O Lord, for these gifts which we are about to receive...
