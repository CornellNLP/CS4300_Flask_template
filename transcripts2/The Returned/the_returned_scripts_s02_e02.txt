 Previously… 
 You fell down the stairs at your home. 
 Don’t worry. The baby is fine. 
 I saw you. You fell on purpose. 
 We’ll perform an anticipated delivery. 
 Hello. 
 Who’s that? 
 A new expert. He’s here for the flood. 
 Your predecessor couldn’t explain why it rose this fast. 
 Have we found all the victims? 
 We’re still looking for corpses, including the police officers. 
 Why did you say he was dead? 
 Because he was. 
 Why you? 
 Audrey might come back too. 
 Audrey, come with me. 
 What a nightmare! 
 Or they’ll come for us. 
 Who? 
 Them. 
 Don’t worry. 
 What if you die someday? 
 I won’t. 
 Don’t worry. 
 35 YEARS AGO You’re the last one. 
 Milan, Pierre is here. 
 Good evening, Pierre. 
 You’re the one we’ve chosen. 
 The point is to just scare them, isn’t it? 
 Don’t worry, Mr. Costa. 
 They know what they have to do. 
 I’m not sure I can. 
 Of course you can, Pierre. 
 Joseph? 
 Do what seems right. 
 Hélène, another glass of wine? 
 Sure. 
 Antoine? Are you OK? 
 What do you want? 
 We want you to leave, and don’t come back. 
 What have we done to you? 
 You were already warned. 
 We want him to leave. 
 Mom? 
 You don’t remember what happened to you? 
 No. 
 I remember I put the boys to bed. 
 That’s all. 
 Victor has a brother? 
 Victor? 
 Your son. 
 Louis. 
 He has a brother, yes. 
 Where do you think he is? 
 I don’t know. 
 And… my husband? 
 Is he dead too? 
 I don’t know. 
 I remember her. 
 Her husband was the boys’ teacher, Mr. Costa. 
 What happened to her? 
 She doesn’t remember either. 
 Are you… 
 No. 
 She’s not dead. 
 Why are you here, then? 
 Victor… 
 I mean, Louis was alone, and I… 
 But you’re here, now. He’s not alone anymore. 
 Thank you for taking care of him. 
 Serge… 
 They almost got to the town. 
 We need more people to get them back. 
 Some have escaped from us already. 
 You think more will come? 
 I guess. 
 Go see Adèle and keep me informed. 
 You shouldn’t have got out of bed. 
 Why isn’t there anyone? 
 We put you here so that you can rest. 
 There are not many people left at the hospital. 
 You’ll need time to recover from your full anesthesia. 
 You want to know how you child is doing? 
 He’s doing very well. 
 He’s under observation, normal procedure for premature babies. 
 We’ll bring him to your room later. 
 Don’t. 
 I don’t want you to bring him. 
 All right… You need to rest. 
 We’ll give you something. 
 I don’t want to take anything. 
 I want to go home. 
 We need to keep you under observation. 
 If you change your mind— 
 I won’t. 
 So? 
 He was born last night. 
 Is he OK? 
 I think so. I couldn’t see him yet. 
 Your mother? 
 She’s fine. 
 Take care of your brother. I can’t do it. 
 It’s your job, you understand? 
 You must do it for me. OK? 
 Come here. 
 The water comes from ground water under the town. 
 But no one understands why it swelled this much and this fast. 
 The dam was checked dozen of times since the flood. 
 Your predecessors didn’t find anything. 
 No cracks on the inside or the outside. 
 Some geologists studied the subsoil. 
 No significant ground movement around the dam wall. 
 Nothing explains why the water didn’t drain off. 
 What’s happening? 
 A girl disappeared last night. They’re looking for her. 
 Will you need our services? 
 Not at the moment. Thank you. 
 As you wish. 
 Good morning. You can’t go in town. 
 We’re Audrey Sabatini’s parents. 
 Of course. 
 We’ll escort you. 
 What’s up? 
 The report on the deer’s death. 
 What does it say? 
 The bite marks on the deer don’t match the teeth of an animal. 
 What does that mean? 
 It was eaten by a human. 
 Thanks. 
 Did you talk to Toni? 
 No. 
 He said he doesn’t remember anything. 
 The doctors think he’s in a state of shock. 
 Will he stay at the hospital? 
 He’ll be released, under supervision. 
 I’ll keep you posted. 
 What are they doing here? 
 Commander, they are Audrey Sabatini’s parents. 
 Have a seat. 
 Thank you for coming quickly. Are you aware of the situation? 
 A little. 
 A girl showed up at the entrance of the town last night. 
 She seemed lost, confused. 
 She said her name was Audrey Sabatini. 
 She also said her address was 18 Jean-Jacques Rousseau Street. 
 Is it your address? 
 That’s where we lived before the flood. 
 Where is she? 
 We took her to the other side of the valley, but she ran away. 
 We’re looking for her. 
 What did she look like? 
 Brown hair, dark eyes, light skin, freckles, about 1.70 meters tall. 
 Do you know someone who would match this description, who could usurp your daughter’s identity? 
 Someone from school, or family, someone who knew of her death? 
 I can’t think of anyone. 
 I can imagine how upsetting this must be for you. 
 We’re researching in the area where she disappeared. 
 Alone in the forest at her age, she won’t go far. We’ll find her soon. 
 Audrey? 
 Don’t you want to go downstairs? My mom has prepared some food. 
 So? 
 She won’t open the door. 
 She must be terrified. 
 Audrey is always terrified. 
 Here, bring her this. 
 She must be hungry. 
 Room service, really? She’s lucky. 
 Please be nice with your friend. 
 She never was my friend. 
 When will you tell her? 
 Tell her what? 
 That she’s dead. 
 What’s happening is traumatizing enough for her. 
 I’ve been through that, I remind you. 
 Yes, but you had your dad and your mom. 
 She’s alone. 
 You think I’m happy to be locked up with you? 
 We’re together. Would you rather be alone? 
 I didn’t ask you to come with me. You should have stayed there. 
 I don’t regret anything. 
 I do. 
 It’s a little dry, no butter. 
 Thanks. 
 Don’t you want to eat? 
 No. 
 Are you sure? Aren’t you hungry? 
 No, I’m not. 
 He’s a little confused. 
 He has changed. 
 He’s growing up. That’s good. 
 Don’t you want to join your mom? 
 That’s not very nice. 
 She scares me. 
 Come on. Go join her. 
 Did you know Victor’s mother? 
 Not very much. My husband knew her better. 
 How was she? 
 What do you mean? 
 Was she doing fine with her kids? 
 Well, yeah. 
 As to what happens behind the blinds… 
 What about her husband? 
 I don’t know. 
 You’re not helping. 
 I only say what I know. 
 It’s mostly the boy who had trouble. 
 He was a scapegoat. 
 I mean, look at him. 
 You must be hurt. 
 Why? 
 You used to have him for yourself. 
 And now… 
 She’s legitimate. She’s his mother. 
 I’m happy for him. 
 Only his happiness matters. 
 Sure. 
 I’m just worried because she’s a little weird. 
 Yeah, and he’s not. 
 Well, thank you, Mrs. Costa. 
 Where are Toni and your mom? 
 They’re gone. 
 Where? 
 Because of the flood. They have evacuated everyone. 
 And you? 
 I hid. 
 Another helping, please. 
 Serge, you’re not alone anymore. 
 I need to be able to trust you. 
 Yes, Dad. 
 Fetch the rifles. 
 Will you be OK? 
 All right… 
 I’ll go now. 
 THE KILLER OF THE TUNNEL: A SUSPECT UNDER ARREST Hello. 
 Sorry to disturb. 
 Who are you? 
 I’m working on the dam. 
 What do you want? 
 May I come in? 
 No. 
 The military found a girl last night. 
 She said her name was Audrey Sabatini. Do you know about this? 
 Where is she? 
 She has disappeared. 
 She was on the bus with your daughter Camille, wasn’t she? 
 Why are you talking about my daughter? 
 What happened at the Helping Hand? 
 Your daughter— 
 She’s dead. 
 
 
 
 Hi, Yan. 
 Hi, Sandrine. 
 Hi, Pierre. 
 The military called us. 
 I know. 
 You’re welcome. 
 I didn’t want to come back. Yan insisted. 
 We were offered a temporarily housing. 
 Here, everyone will understand you and listen to you. 
 There’s nothing to say. 
 Audrey is dead. 
 Everyone hasn’t left? 
 Many have left, but some have stayed. 
 And others have come. 
 Do they know what happened here? 
 Of course. 
 I think we should stay here, as Pierre is suggesting. 
 Happy to see you again. 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Sure. Excuse me. 
 Toni is at the Lake Pub. 
 Toni? 
 I’m dead, aren’t I? 
 I’m sorry. 
 I didn’t want to come back. 
 I had to pay for what I did to Serge. 
 Do you know where he is? 
 No. 
 I went to your place. No one is there. 
 Did you see my mom or Camille? 
 I’m sorry. 
 I just wanted everything to stop. 
 Hi, Toni. Hi, Léna. 
 What do you guys want? 
 We know what happened to you. 
 You need our help. They won’t leave you alone. 
 You’ll be safe with us. 
 Don’t trust them. 
 Toni… 
 You can count on us. 
 I’m scared. 
 Don’t worry. 
 It’s normal that you’re scared. 
 Toni… 
 Toni! 
 Lieutenant, still no sign of the girl. 
 Let’s move to the north perimeter. 
 Esteban! 
 Audrey? 
 Esteban? 
 What is it? 
 Esteban is outside. 
 Open the door. 
 Please let him in. 
 Open the door. 
 I’m so happy to see you. 
 Come in. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 There’s nobody anywhere. No one at my place. 
 I couldn’t go home. 
 At your place? 
 Esteban used to live in the domain. 
 “Used to”? 
 They will be coming for you. You need to hide. 
 Mom, what are you doing? Stop it. 
 Here. 
 Wait, I can’t stay here. 
 It’s for your safety. 
 Mom, don’t. 
 Esteban… 
 What are you doing? 
 I’m out! 
 No! 
 Give me the key! 
 You need to stay here. 
 Give it to me! 
 No! 
 Mom, let him go. 
 Come with me. 
 No! Camille! Camille! 
 Is there another road? 
 It’s the only road. 
 What the hell is happening? 
 I told you. There was a flood. 
 Rescue should be coming. 
 No one’s looking for you. 
 I don’t care. I’ll cross. 
 Esteban! 
 Who are they? 
 What the hell do they want? 
 Don’t stand there. 
 You made the right choice. You’ll be safe here. 
 It’s Toni? 
 No. 
 It’s not him anymore. 
 Toni is dead. 
 Who were those people? 
 We’re safe if we stay away from them. 
 What do they want? 
 To keep us from leaving the domain. 
 Why? What do they want? 
 A ransom? 
 Why no one’s looking for us? 
 Because we’re dead. 
 Four years ago, the bus had an accident. 
 No one survived. 
 Everyone thinks you’re dead. 
 And we can’t go away from here. 
 That’s impossible. 
 It’s the truth. I swear. 
 Let’s move. 
 Wait! I said wait! 
 Stop it! 
 I’ll show you I’m dead. 
 When you’re already dead, you’re immortal, aren’t you? 
 You’ll see I’m not lying. 
 Camille, stop it. 
 How do you know? 
 How do you know you’re immortal? 
 You know the rules? 
 I have something to show you. 
 Dad? 
 Dad? 
 TRAGEDY OF THE BUS NO SURVIVOR 
 What is this? 
 I’ve gathered information on those who came back at the same time as Camille, there. 
 And this? 
 They all died in the valley. 
 Tragically. Accidents, drowning, murders… 
 What are you looking for? 
 Why did Camille come back, and not them. 
 I’m looking for the meaning, the explanation, the logic… 
 So, I’ve piled up those dates of deaths. 
 When I have all of them, I think I’ll find the combination. 
 Well, one combination. 
 Look. 
 If you place the dates and the places on top of each other, you see sectors appear, that are like entrance and exit portals. 
 And that are rotating. It’s never at the same time. 
 Like on a circle. 
 And I think that if I can understand this combination, I’ll know where and when Claire and Camille will come back. 
 From where? 
 I don’t know where they are. 
 That’s what you’ve been doing for months? 
 That’s what you’re working on? 
 Listen… Léna, I know that… 
 Wait, Léna. 
 Wait! Léna. 
 Léna, listen to me. 
 Toni and your mom are dead? 
 I saw the two crosses. 
 You lied to me, Serge. 
 Sorry, Dad. 
 Why aren’t you dead too? 
 I’m dead. 
 Tell me the truth. 
 I swear. 
 I’m like you. 
 It’s Toni. 
 He stopped me from doing harm. 
 What did he do to you? 
 What did he do? 
 I needed to stop. He warned me… 
 I needed to stop. 
 What is this? 
 That’s where your bus fell. 
 IN MEMORY OF THE 38 CHILDREN AND THOSE WHO WERE WITH THEM… 
 Camille, my friend, my love, my sister, my beautiful, my confidant… 
 You will always be with me. Léna Your baby’s condition has suddenly deteriorated. His heart rate is too low. He’s under 70 beats per minute, which is very insufficient. We’ll put him on life support. Maybe… If you want to see him, we can take you there. I want to go home. We may not… Sorry, but we may not be able to reverse the trend. It would be important for you to see him now. What first name will you give him? He needs an identity, even in case of death. Name him as you like. All right. I like when his hair is shorter. What is this? What’s going on? He shouldn’t draw, and he knows it. Why not? He likes it. I know what’s best for him. You shouldn’t draw, Louis. You know it. My name’s Victor. Stay here! What the hell? You don’t know him. You have no idea what we did for him. You have no right to judge me. His development is alarming. He’s in critical condition. You shouldn’t stay here. He’s going to die. You need to do something. Please, Mommy. Are you OK? Milan. He’s back. Mom? Mom? I have a pulse. Prepare the intubation. Are you OK? Why doesn’t you mom want you to draw? I don’t know. Because she doesn’t love me. Yes, she does. You love me. That’s why I grew up. Sometimes, she wouldn’t allow me to go out. Really? Didn’t your father say anything? He did. He was nicer? Maybe he’ll come back too. He won’t. Why are you saying that? He’s not dead. What? He’s not dead. He’s alive. No! Good evening, Mr. Lewanski. We’re at the limit of the search perimeter. Suspend the operation. It’s getting dark. Go.
