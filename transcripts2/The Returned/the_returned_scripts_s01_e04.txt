 male announcer : Previously on The Returned... 
 Sorry, I didn't know you were in here. 
 I died, didn't I? 
 Where would we go? 
 We could go to California, Paris, anywhere you want. 
 Let's be realistic. 
 This whole thing isn't realistic. 
 Hiding her here? 
 How long do you think you could keep that up? 
 Hey, what are you doing out here? 
 Are you lost? 
 You must be cold. Where's your coat? 
 Come inside. 
 He's family? What's the matter, Victor? 
 Cat got your tongue? 
 I know about the boy. I know what he is. 
 I told you, he's my nephew. 
 Prove it. 
 You crazy bitch. 
 You stay away from Victor and you stay away from me. 
 I'm calling the cops! 
 Drop dead! 
 Jill : The little boy closed his eyes. 
 The fairy made him promise not to open them again until they were out of the haunted woods and back safe and warm in his bed. 
 "I'll always watch over you," she said and in the dark, she took his hand. 
 "Your wish is my command." 
 And so she grants his wish, every time. 
 Isn't she beautiful? 
 The fairy will always protect you. 
 Who is she, Mom? You never say. 
 You'll know her when you see her. 
 She'll send you a sign. Trust me. 
 [chuckles] 
 You carry the weight of the world in that head. 
 But now it's time to go to sleep. 
 Love you. 
 [door closes] 
 [sighs] 
 [Jill screams] 
 Richard : Shut up! 
 [gunshots] 
 Check who else is in the house. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [hangers rattling] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 It's okay. Shh. Just stay where you are. 
 Don't let him see you. We'll be gone soon. 
 Sing a song inside your head until we leave. 
 Try it. 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Nobody. 
 Don't screw this up for us, asshole. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Leave it. Come on, it's just a little kid. 
 No! 
 [bullet casing clatters] 
 Tanya : Help! 
 Stay here. 
 Help! 
 [screams] 
 [whimpering] 
 [cats meowing] 
 [cat purring] 
 [coffee pouring] 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 I think you're right... about moving. 
 What made you change your mind? 
 I woke up this morning feeling hopeful. 
 For a second, I thought I was still dreaming. 
 Can we really make this work, Jack? 
 Yes. 
 [knock at door] 
 Shane, hi. 
 What's going on? 
 Good morning, Mrs. Winship. 
 We're looking for your husband. 
 Hey, guys. 
 We'd like to ask you some questions. 
 About Lucy McCabe. 
 Who's that? 
 She works at the Dog Star. 
 Why? What's going on? 
 It'll be better if we talk about it at the station. 
 It's okay, I'll be back. 
 You want me to come with you? 
 No, no, it's okay, I got it. 
 Tommy : Think fast. 
 Good catch. 
 There's a monster in the attic, just so you know. 
 Sometimes houses creak. It's called settling. 
 Or maybe it's mice. 
 [car horn honks] 
 Ah, okay. There's Mrs. Kurata. 
 Got to get going, kid. 
 Have a great day. 
 Bye. 
 Tommy : Bye. 
 Is there something on your mind? 
 Just the wedding, all the details... 
 You know, it's got my head spinning. 
 Well, we could wait, you know to get married if it's bringing stuff up. 
 I mean, I'm the one who's been pushing for it. 
 Maybe it's not the right thing. 
 You really think, as long as we've known each other that you could push me into anything? 
 I'm sure there are things I still don't know about you even after all this time. 
 I'm fine. It's just a mood. 
 It'll pass. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Tommy : Solano. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. I'm on my way. 
 Go, go. Don't get caught up in me. 
 [smooches] 
 It's too late for that. 
 [door opens, closes] 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Stop. Simon. 
 Simon! Stop. 
 Sorry. 
 I'm still trying to get used to you. 
 So many things I wanted to tell you to share with you, and now that you're here I can't think of a single one of them. 
 You're actually here. 
 You kept my guitar. 
 I kept everything. 
 Do you know I still have a Facebook page? 
 People wrote the nicest stuff about me. 
 Yeah. 
 I used to look at it sometimes. 
 Why were the cops here earlier? 
 They needed your dad's help with something. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 Your father and I have been talking about moving. 
 But I just got back. 
 [conversation continues indistinctly] 
 [breathing shakily] 
 Camille : But this is my home. 
 Mom, I don't want to leave. I love it here. 
 I want to be near all my friends. 
 What kind of life will that be for you? 
 How will I know if you don't let me find out? 
 Claire : You can't pretend to be Alice forever. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [conversation continues indistinctly] 
 Mom! 
 Oh, my God! Lena! 
 Lena? 
 [knocking on door] 
 Is Jack on his way? 
 He's at the police station. 
 I'm not sure. 
 When did this start? 
 Right after she came back. 
 You think this is my fault? 
 You know it is. 
 I didn't do anything to you. 
 Of course you didn't. Lena, stop it. 
 Tell me what you think is going on here. 
 She's still all you care about even when she's killing me. 
 [indistinct chatter over police radio] 
 [knock at door] 
 Was it him? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, that's two people in only a few days. 
 We don't know they're connected. Did you know your neighbor? 
 I knew her. We weren't friends. 
 [clatter] 
 Is there someone here? 
 [gasps] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Hey. 
 It's okay. 
 What happened? 
 Who is this? 
 Victor. He's been staying with me. 
 He was lost. 
 Listen, why don't you go to the bedroom and wait for me, okay? 
 It's okay. 
 It'll be all right. 
 He was lost, as in you found him? 
 How long has he been staying here? 
 A few days. 
 Did you file a police report? 
 I went to the police station, remember? 
 No one was looking for him. 
 So you just kept him? 
 Holy sh1t. Are you out of your mind? 
 You can't just take a kid home, Julie, he's not a stray dog. 
 It's not like that. Please don't push it. 
 Don't push it? 
 You act like I'm busting you for a jaywalking ticket. 
 This thing could be considered kidnapping. 
 Do you get what I'm saying? 
 Tommy over intercom : Nik, you good? 
 Be right there. 
 It's my life. 
 Please, stay out of it. 
 Can't do that. 
 [door opens] 
 Does she know that I'm her real dad? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, we told her everything. 
 Tommy wanted her to know the truth. 
 Has he been around the whole time? 
 Pretty much. 
 I couldn't have done that, you know. 
 Been with someone so soon if you had died. 
 I mean, I know that's a weird thing to say but I know it. 
 You don't know anything. 
 You're still 25. 
 I want to be grateful you had someone but I'm not. 
 Tommy : Does Claire know about your affair with Lucy? 
 We looked up Lucy's bank accounts. 
 The only big deposits were all checks written by you somewhere around $20,000 over the last year. 
 That's a lot of cash. 
 Does your wife know about that? 
 Please, keep Claire out of this. 
 I get it. 
 Ahh. 
 You're in a midlife crisis and along comes this 27-year-old stone-cold fox of a girl, and she likes you. 
 She thinks you're smart. 
 Then you realize that it's not real and that kicks you in the gut. It's humiliating. 
 Hell, I'd be pissed, too. 
 You know that your small-change bad-cop routine is embarrassing, right? 
 Did she admit that it was a con the bullshit custody suit, the ex? 
 Or did you discover that on your own? 
 I know you've been through a lot and there's not a person in this town who doesn't know that and I'm sorry for it. 
 Grief. 
 It twists people up. 
 Makes monsters out of them sometimes. 
 Maybe this girl brought out some anger in you. 
 Maybe she deserved it in your mind. 
 Okay. 
 Well, let's just acknowledge that she lied to me and took a bunch of my money. 
 Whatever. 
 I cared about her. 
 How she felt about me, I don't know but I didn't hurt her, and I'm not gonna apologize for something that saved my life. 
 [rumbling, gurgling] 
 [gasps] 
 
 
 
 Hello, there. 
 There's something wrong with your water. 
 Excuse me? 
 It all rises to the surface eventually, doesn't it? 
 Are you looking for food? 
 Shelter? 
 I have a home. 
 But they changed the locks. 
 Well, maybe I can help you with that. 
 We haven't met. I'm Pastor Wright. 
 I know who you are. 
 I was at George's funeral. 
 Were you close with George? 
 I used to be. 
 He was my heart. 
 I heard your sermon. 
 You seem like a nice man. 
 Why would you lie to all those people? 
 Promising them an afterlife you can't possibly know exists? 
 And you can't know it doesn't. 
 Oh, yeah? Want to bet? 
 Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen. 
 [scoffs] 
 Whatever that means. 
 So, you really believe that people rise from the dead? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Because I've been thinking about Lazarus. 
 Now, we all know he rose from the dead, right? 
 But what happened after that? 
 They never say, and I would like to know. 
 I mean, that's the interesting story, isn't it? 
 Was he happy about it? 
 I have a feeling his sisters weren't too happy. 
 Bet they weren't happy at all when he came back. 
 It's just too weird. 
 And probably running around the house, whispering "This was a mistake. There's something not right about him." 
 And that something was, is that Lazarus was dead. 
 And he should've stayed that way. 
 Lazarus' sisters begged Christ to bring him back. 
 And that is my point. 
 He shouldn't have listened. 
 The finality's for a reason, Pastor. 
 Don't you think? 
 I mean, to just go on and on, it would... 
 Oh, that would be excruciating. 
 How do you organize a life with no death to define it? 
 I really want to know. 
 The Caldwell Community Center has a nice dormitory. 
 Can I help you find someplace to stay? 
 [sighs] 
 Victor? 
 [sighs] 
 Victor? 
 What are you doing in here? 
 Did you draw this? 
 Did you see something across the hall last night? 
 Come on, you got to come out of there. 
 [sighs] 
 I don't know how to help you. 
 [thudding overhead] 
 [thud] 
 [sighs] 
 Do you think it's my fault, what's happening to Lena? 
 Why would God bring you back just to make the people who love you suffer? 
 They've suffered enough. 
 Then why does she hate me? 
 I don't think she hates you. 
 Have you ever heard of survivors' guilt? 
 I died in an accident. Lena wasn't even there. 
 Well, maybe that's why. She blames herself. 
 She was supposed to be on the bus that day. 
 That's right, but she wasn't. 
 Instead, she lost her sister, the closest person to her in the world. 
 And the thing is life forces you to keep on living. 
 It just does. 
 And joy returns. 
 Whether you think you deserve it or not. 
 It may take Lena a while to come back from that but I think she will when she realizes you're here to stay. 
 Am I here to stay? 
 I think so. 
 I hope so. 
 Dr. Hiromoto : Was your daughter in an accident? 
 Claire : Lena? No, never. 
 Could someone have hurt her? 
 No. 
 I don't know. She doesn't tell me much. 
 I have a teenager. I get it. 
 The thing is, what's on Lena's back it looks like a puncture wound like she was impaled on something. 
 What? 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 And at the same time, it appears to be spreading quickly. 
 Her body's turning on itself. 
 I can't say I've ever seen this before. 
 I have to ask, is there something you're not telling us, Mrs. Winship? 
 Anything that could help us help your daughter? 
 No, there's nothing. 
 What about her father? Where is he? 
 Can I talk to him? 
 I'll talk to him. Thank you, Doctor. 
 He put cameras in the ceiling? 
 Why would he do that? 
 I don't know. 
 Did he see us? 
 I don't know. 
 You have to get out of here. 
 Come with me. 
 You and Chloe. 
 This guy's not normal. He could be dangerous. 
 No, Tommy wouldn't do anything to hurt us. 
 How can you say that? 
 Chloe, don't be scared. 
 Who is he? 
 He's your father. 
 My father's dead. 
 He was but he came back. 
 Is he an angel? 
 Yeah, he kind of is. 
 Can I touch him? 
 You're warm. 
 So are you. 
 We can't tell anybody about the angel, not even Tommy, you understand, okay? 
 He's gonna have to go now. 
 But you'll see him soon, okay? 
 Come with me. 
 I can't. 
 Not right now. I have to talk to him. 
 He's been there for me since you left. 
 I need to hear his explanation. 
 Okay? 
 I'll be back soon, okay? 
 Right. Okay, well, thank you, Loretta. 
 I appreciate it. 
 There's no easy way to say this. 
 Jack is being questioned in connection with Lucy McCabe the waitress that was stabbed in the tunnel. 
 He's a suspect? 
 Apparently, yeah. 
 They think Jack stabbed her? 
 Jack and Lucy were... involved. 
 Apparently, Jack gave her money, a lot of it. 
 Where is this information coming from? 
 Well, I have a friend at the police station. 
 Who feels totally comfortable repeating this confidential information to you? 
 I know you're trying to protect me here but there is a level of respect missing everywhere. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [knocking on door] 
 [lock opens] 
 Nikki's gonna take you to a better place. 
 There will be people who will take care of you who will be there all the time. 
 People who will help you. 
 I wish I could. 
 This is the right thing. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [door opens] 
 [door closes] 
 [whispering] Hey. 
 I came as soon as I could. 
 How's she doing? What's happening? 
 They still don't know anything except it's getting worse. 
 They want to move her to a bigger hospital. 
 [sighs] Where's Camille? 
 The cafeteria, eating, again. 
 Aren't you worried somebody will recognize her? 
 Let's talk outside. 
 I checked our accounts. 
 All the money from Camille's college fund is gone. 
 [sighs] 
 She was dead. 
 And that money came from my family. 
 I just want to get this clear. 
 The money we saved for our daughter's college, you spent on a hooker. 
 Lucy was not a hooker. 
 She said she had a gift that she could channel dead people talk to Camille. 
 Why do the police think you two had a relationship? 
 Because she said that... 
 [sighs] 
 She said that we had to be having s*x for it to work. 
 And you believed that? 
 Come on, Claire, I was a mess. 
 I don't have to tell you that. 
 I lost everything... 
 Camille, you, Lena. 
 I would have done anything to make that pain go away. 
 And it helped. 
 And I didn't hurt her. 
 I know you didn't but this is the end. 
 I'm not going anywhere with you. 
 Peter : It's more comfortable than it looks. 
 I promise. 
 So, just let me know if you need an extra pillow or... 
 It's fine, not necessary. 
 I don't sleep anymore, anyway. 
 Will you excuse me for one moment, please. 
 Nikki : Hi. 
 Peter : Well, this must be Victor. 
 Thanks for taking him in on such short notice. 
 Well, of course. That's what we do. 
 Does Victor have a last name? 
 Nikki : We don't know. 
 He hasn't told us yet. 
 Okay, that's all right. 
 A lot of cool people have only one name... 
 Zorro, Elvis. 
 Elvis actually had a last name. 
 Just pointing that out. 
 Thank you, Nikki. 
 Well, you have my number. 
 Yeah. 
 If he needs anything, call me. 
 Of course. We will take great care of him. 
 So, Victor, do you like games? 
 Because I got to tell you we have an entire room full of games. 
 Helen, if you'll just give me one more minute. Thanks. 
 Here we go. 
 [exhales deeply] 
 [door opens, closes] 
 How much did you see? 
 All of it. 
 Do you know how disgusting you make me feel? 
 Who are you? 
 I quit watching you for a long time. 
 But when you started acting strange, I got worried. 
 I was afraid you'd hurt yourself again. 
 I'm an animal in a cage to you? 
 I was trying to keep you safe. 
 I didn't know how to help you. 
 I'm leaving. You know that, right? 
 Listen to me. 
 This guy who you made love to today, he left you once, and he'll do it again. 
 Pastor Wright asked me to say that it was an accident. 
 It wasn't an accident, Rowan. 
 Simon stepped in front of an 18-wheeler. 
 He killed himself on the day that he was supposed to marry you knowing you were pregnant and not caring that it would ruin you. 
 You knew that? 
 Given everything you were going through, everyone thought... 
 Everyone? 
 Not everyone. Me. 
 Pastor Wright, he was counseling me. 
 So you just decided what I could and couldn't handle? 
 When we first met when I told you that Simon was dead that sound you made it still haunts me. 
 I would've done anything to protect you. 
 You made a decision that changed the course of my whole damn life, and I didn't even know you. 
 I loved you the minute I saw you. 
 You do not want to touch me right now. 
 Don't touch me! 
 You are crushing me. 
 I can't breathe. 
 Just get away. Get away from me. 
 Guys, if my dad catches us, I'm gonna be so dead. 
 I'm sorry, Lena. That was so stupid. 
 We'll just be a minute. Thanks, Abby. 
 You sure you want to do this? 
 I need to. 
 I can still feel her. 
 All right. 
 She's so cold. 
 Yeah, you probably shouldn't be touching her. 
 [sobbing] 
 I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 [continues sobbing] 
 They said, um, part of the bus like, a metal part went through her back. 
 Hey, Lena, come on, let's go. 
 Don't touch me! 
 We did this. This is because of us! 
 [sobbing] 
 Hey. 
 You okay, buddy? 
 You afraid of the dark? 
 You know what I used to do when I was afraid? 
 I would sing a song inside my head. 
 You should try it. 
 You know, just pick a song and then sing it inside your head until you fall asleep, okay? 
 Good night.
