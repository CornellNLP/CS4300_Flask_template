 Previously on The Returned... 
 Tony's your brother? 
 Tony's brother's dead. 
 Tony told everyone you died because you were sick. 
 He lied. I was a bad person. 
 You don't seem like a bad person. 
 Claire, what are you doing all the way out here? 
 Hi, I'm Alice, Lena's cousin. 
 With the resemblance, you look so much alike. 
 Can I help you? 
 I have a message for you from Simon. 
 He says to meet him at the train station tonight at 6:00, and bring Chloe. 
 How much did you see? 
 All of it. 
 I quit watching you for a long time, but when you started acting strange, I got worried. 
 I was afraid you'd hurt yourself again. 
 I'm an animal in a cage to you. 
 I was trying to keep you safe. 
 You do not want to touch me right now. 
 Don't touch me! 
 [shredder whirring] 
 [exhales sharply] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Mommy, I can't find my purple headband. 
 [sighs] 
 Let's go look for it together. 
 There she is. 
 Oh, my goodness, you're getting so big. 
 What'd you eat for lunch today, a horse? 
 Thanks for taking her on such short notice. 
 Of course. It'll be fun. 
 It's just a flu, but Francesca's got nobody else to look after her. 
 She didn't want to go with you? 
 No, no, I don't her getting whatever Francesca has. 
 She'll be better off with you. 
 You behave yourself for Tommy, okay? 
 I will. 
 You know how much I love you, right? 
 Well, take that and multiply it by a million... 
 By 10 million and it still won't be enough. 
 And you know how much I love you too, right? 
 I love you too, baby. 
 Give your sister my love. 
 I better go. 
 [mournful orchestral music] 
 You should never have been a mother. 
 Chloe deserves better. So does Tommy. 
 You're just dragging them down. 
 You're gonna ruin both their lives. 
 You're not real. 
 You're just in my head. 
 You're just like me, Rowan. 
 That's why we belong together. 
 Hey, Francesca, it's Tommy. 
 Sorry to hear you're under the weather. 
 Really. 
 What time are you expecting Rowan to get in? 
 Rowan? 
 Rowan! 
 Rowan! 
 No. No, baby, no. 
 No, no, Rowan, come on, wake up. 
 Rowan, it's me, baby. Wake up. 
 Rowan. 
 Come on, baby. 
 Come on, baby. Wake up. 
 Think your cousin Eladio would want to sit here next to Emma? 
 Emma. 
 Emma, my college roommate. 
 I was thinking of putting them together. 
 Well, what does she look like? 
 What kind of question is that? 
 It's a key question to all wedding planning. 
 You know how many relationships start at weddings? 
 Well, she's very cute. 
 Well, good. 
 Then Eladio the shot. 
 Long day? 
 The waitress stabbing? 
 Mm. 
 Any leads? 
 We're working on it. 
 [sighs] 
 [laughs] 
 Hey, I'm not the one in the tub. 
 [knock at door] 
 [sighs] Good. 
 You're okay. 
 I left you, like, four messages. 
 Why? 
 Did you think I was gonna jump out my window? 
 You need to know Victor's back. 
 You're not gonna take him away again. 
 He's staying with me. 
 Okay. 
 I've missed you. 
 Ben was here. 
 He knows. 
 I kissed him, and he ran away. 
 It's okay, honey. 
 We'll get through this. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Adam? 
 [door creaking] 
 Adam? 
 [engine revving] 
 Tony. Thank God you're here. 
 I found this necklace. It was Lucy's. 
 I remember asking her about it, 'cause it's got this thumbprint on it. 
 What are you doing? Let me go. 
 I won't tell anyone. 
 Shh. 
 Let me go, please. 
 Stop talking, stop talking. 
 I won't tell anyone, I swear. 
 Please! No, just let me go, please! 
 No! 
 Shut up. 
 [screaming] 
 Shut up. 
 Shut up. 
 Let me go! 
 No, please! 
 Help me! Please! 
 Crowbar. 
 You sure you guys want to do this? 
 My dad's the funeral director. 
 Guys, you won't even be able to tell if it's her. 
 After people die, their internal organs liquefy. 
 Then they swell, and they break open like a rotten pumpkin, and that's before they even decay. 
 I'm up for it. 
 What about you, Ben? 
 Like I said, pass me the crowbar. 
 Ready? 
 [both grunt] 
 [liquid splashes] 
 What the... 
 There's no way. 
 [phone shutter clicks] 
 All of you, get up out of there. 
 Go on. I already called the cops. 
 Hey. 
 What's going on, guys? 
 Camille Winship was in your class, right? 
 Why were you digging up her grave? 
 You know that's a felony. 
 Just tell me what the hell you guys were doing there, where the body is, and I might just chalk this up as a bad prank and let it all go away. 
 [sighs] 
 It wasn't in there. 
 What? 
 The body. 
 When we opened up the coffin, all that was in there was water. 
 He's telling the truth. 
 Why were you doing this? 
 Okay, then we'll just start the booking paperwork. 
 Because... 
 I think she's back. 
 Back. 
 From the dead. 
 [children shouting indistinctly] 
 How did you find me? 
 I always know where to find you. 
 I'm an angel after all, right? 
 Do you want to play with me? 
 I can't. Not right now. 
 But I need you to deliver a message to your mom for me, okay? 
 Okay, tell her I'm coming to pick you guys up tonight right after dark. 
 Be ready, okay? 
 It's a secret, so you can't tell anyone else. 
 Okay? Promise me? 
 Is Tommy coming too? 
 No, no, he's not. 
 Just you and your mom, my family. 
 You tell, all right? 
 It's really important. 
 Can I help you with something? 
 Chloe, who was that man? Let's go. 
 You seem upset. 
 Why don't you tell me what's been going on for you this week? 
 I'm done. 
 Done? 
 Sitting here, talking to you. 
 I've been seeing you for almost six years, Rowan. 
 What's changed since last week? 
 Six years. Holy sh1t. 
 Six years of processing, grieving, and crying, and I'm sick of it, trying to find some place or perspective for Simon in my life. 
 Well, you're very angry. What happened? 
 No, actually I'm way beyond angry. 
 I'm supremely pissed. 
 I've wasted all this time, this energy, this money on this man who left me. 
 Say a little more. 
 Okay, here's a little more. 
 I'm not gonna give Simon another second of my life. 
 Thank you. Good-bye. 
 [knock at door] 
 Hey, Claire. 
 Sheriff. 
 I need to talk to your niece, Alice. 
 She's out with her friends, with Lena's friends. 
 Why? 
 I need to check something out with her. 
 Hey. 
 Peter. 
 When she gets home, I need you to bring her by the station with her ID, okay? 
 Sure thing. 
 Thanks. 
 How does he know? 
 [children shouting joyfully] 
 Are those your moms? 
 A girl in my class has two moms. 
 My mom's dead. 
 My dad was dead, but he's back. 
 I'm dead too. 
 Are you an angel? 
 Why did you have the meeting moved here? 
 Because Tommy Solano, the sheriff, came here today looking for Camille. 
 Why, does he know? 
 We don't know for sure. 
 Our assumption is that he heard from Ben Lowry, Lena's friend. 
 He does know, so invariably, other people will find out, and soon. 
 So you're going to tell them? 
 You didn't think I needed to weigh in on this? 
 She's my daughter. 
 Keep your voice down. 
 This isn't about you or your feelings. 
 It's about Camille. 
 If you ever want her to have a normal life again, this is where it starts. 
 As painful and cruel as it may seem, death is a natural part of life, and many have argued that it's death that gives life itself meaning. 
 Without death, would we accomplish as much? 
 Would we connect to each other as deeply? 
 I have been so inspired by all of you... 
 Your generosity, resilience, support. 
 Now the Winship family... 
 They need some of that support. 
 Over the last few days, they have experienced something extraordinary, and they would like to share that with you now. 
 It won't make any sense at first, but I think about all the mystery in our lives, how much we... We don't know, how much is inexplicable. 
 Try not to react right away. 
 Try to keep an open mind. 
 [gasps] 
 Camille? 
 It's okay, sweetheart. Come on out. 
 [woman gasps] 
 Is this some kind of a sick joke or something? 
 No, no, it's not. 
 You told me that she was your niece. 
 I didn't know how to explain, Kris. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This is impossible. 
 If Bethany came back, you'd know it was her. 
 I hope you will show Camille the compassion you'd want shown to your own child. 
 [mournful orchestral music] 
 What are you doing here? 
 You lied to me. Ma's not back. 
 Where's Lena? 
 She's safe. 
 Safe? 
 What do you mean, safe? 
 She knows about you. 
 Where is she? 
 [cries] 
 Camille, did any of our kids... 
 Did any of them come back with you? 
 I didn't see any of them, not up on the road. 
 I hope they do. 
 Why you? 
 We don't know why, Kris. 
 Well, there must be some reason she's the only one who came back. 
 Bethany was a good girl. 
 She was sweet. 
 She was kind to everybody. 
 I-I... Why isn't she here? 
 This... this doesn't make any sense. 
 You weren't even nice. 
 She told me all about you, how you made her cry in gym class, so why you? 
 Kris... Kris, that's enough. 
 
 
 
 Camille? 
 [knock at door] 
 Go away. 
 Why did I listen to you? That was a stupid idea. 
 They're scared. 
 They don't understand it. 
 Imagine how they feel, how overwhelming this must be for them. 
 How about how I feel? 
 They think I'm a monster. 
 Don't be selfish. 
 What? 
 You came back. 
 Do you know how lucky you are to get a second chance at life? 
 And what are you doing with it? 
 Nothing, except feeling sorry for yourself. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 Help them. 
 Imagine the pain in their hearts, and think about how you can help. 
 I don't want to. 
 This is the hand you were dealt. 
 Give them some hope. 
 I want to be your brother again, and I want to help you. 
 But I don't want to hurt Lena, and I don't want you to hurt Lena. 
 You don't need to worry about it. 
 She's my friend. 
 I know her from the bar. 
 Her sister died. She's... 
 She's a good person. 
 Tony, I'm not gonna hurt her. 
 You hurt Lucy. 
 Look, that night when I came back, I was still... I was still confused, and I had these feelings, and I understand that's why you and Ma did what you did to me, 'cause you had to. 
 But I'm different now. 
 I don't want to hurt Lena. 
 I want to take care of her. 
 I can't trust you. 
 Ma said don't ever trust you. 
 Tony, look, this is because of you. 
 You saved me. 
 What you did... It changed me. 
 Thank you. 
 You're not mad at me? 
 No, I'm grateful. 
 So what do we do? 
 We can't hurt Lena. 
 We can't let her go. She'll go to the police. 
 What do we do? 
 Just let me handle it. 
 [grunts] 
 [metal clanks] 
 Look, I'm sorry about all this. 
 [quivers] 
 [knife sawing] 
 Forgive Tony, okay? 
 'Cause he didn't know what he was doing. 
 It's fine. 
 Please don't tell anyone about me. 
 Get out of here. 
 Nobody was in pain. 
 I know because I could feel them. 
 What exactly did you feel, Camille? 
 I felt their presence, like they were telling me that they were all right, that they were at peace. 
 Bethany was there too. 
 Camille, do you remember us? 
 Of course. You're Oliver's parents. 
 That's right. 
 Oliver was a good guy. 
 He made everybody laugh. 
 He was my friend. 
 Did you see Oliver on the other side? 
 I didn't see him exactly. 
 That's not what it was like. 
 But I felt him. 
 He was there with me, and he was good. 
 He was at peace. 
 Were you in heaven? 
 I don't know where I was, but it was beautiful and peaceful. 
 It was the most beautiful place I've ever seen. 
 Did Oliver say anything to you? 
 It wasn't in words, but he misses you. 
 And he knows he'll see you again. 
 He's waiting for you. 
 Can we give you a hug? 
 This isn't right. She's lying to them. 
 This is how we can move forward, Jack. 
 You're a lucky man. 
 What a blessing to have your family back together. 
 Built in 1986, rebuilt in '93, okay? 
 Cause of flood. Any guesses? 
 Soil erosion? 
 Foundational instability? 
 [imitates buzzer] Wrong. 
 What is the cheapest way to make concrete for this dam? 
 Use the materials excavated during construction in your aggregate. 
 Uh, yeah, that's right. Can I help you, ma'am? 
 Oh, I was wondering if I could just listen in for a little bit. 
 It's just so fascinating listening to you. 
 [clears throat] 
 Yeah, that's fine. 
 So that's exactly right. 
 The dam contractor knew that bringing large amounts of cement and rock up to the dam construction site would be very, very costly, so he thought, "Hey, let's not do that. 
 "Instead, let's make our own cheap-ass concrete right here onsite. 
 Who cares if it has poor tensile strength and low water resistance." 
 And yet some dam inspector passed the job with flying colors. 
 Greed. 
 Pardon? 
 It was greed. 
 Men who were greedy. 
 Didn't care about anything but themselves. 
 And while no one was prosecuted, clearly a group of men lined their pockets while 84 others lost their lives. 
 All right, follow me over here. 
 [horn blares] 
 Help! Please help me! 
 Please! 
 Mommy, I have a secret to tell you. 
 What's that, honey? 
 The angel's coming tonight. 
 Angel? 
 I saw him today. 
 Where? 
 At the park, at camp. 
 He's coming to our house tonight to take us away. 
 Where are we going? Do you know? 
 Just get in. 
 Ladies, mint and English breakfast. 
 Jack, can I get you a cup of tea? 
 What you really want to say is, "I told you so." 
 I'll save you the trouble. 
 You were right. It worked. 
 She's happy. 
 Claire's happy, so I'm happy. 
 Thank you. 
 [groans] 
 [chuckles] 
 Causality is the empirical relationship between cause and effect. 
 I'm drunk because I just had four shots of tequila. 
 This is all physics 101. Why aren't you drunk? 
 Not everything can be explained with science. 
 Actually, I think most things can be explained with science. 
 What about love? 
 Love is a chemical process, but it's a little more complicated than that. 
 Yeah, it's confusing. 
 So you're married? 
 My husband's dead. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 He worked at the dam too. 
 Really? What's his name? 
 You wouldn't know him. It was a long time ago. 
 What'd he do? 
 Construction. 
 Construction, really? 
 The last work they did out there was just rebuilding the dam. 
 [sighs] 
 [mellow music] 
 What? 
 Glen. 
 Mm. 
 I love this song. Please dance with me. 
 No, I don't... 
 I haven't danced in so many years. 
 Please, please, please dance with me. 
 [chuckles] 
 Bad things happen for a reason. 
 Don't you think? 
 Uh, sure. 
 Everything happens for a reason, but... 
 Maybe... 
 [sighs] 
 Maybe this town was meant to be washed away. 
 Maybe building the dam was a mistake. 
 Maybe we all should have died. 
 No, I don't think we were all meant to die. 
 It was an accident, and out of it came a dam that saved the town and holds twice as much irrigation water, so... 
 But what if it were to break again? 
 It can't. It won't. 
 I mean, if somebody wanted to destroy it, I bet they could destroy it. 
 Sure. 
 Somebody could climb into one of the diversion tunnels with a huge bomb or something, but... I'm sorry. 
 I don't know why we're talking about this. 
 There's no reason to talk about it anymore. 
 Wait. 
 [sighs] 
 Trust me. 
 [breathes heavily] 
 What are you doing? 
 Get out. 
 Go on, Victor. Go to bed. 
 Doesn't he ever sleep? 
 No. 
 [sighs] 
 [ominous music] 
 [radio crackles] 
 1027, channel ten. 
 02, go ahead. 
 Surveillance unit, we have a 1016 in progress. 
 Requesting backup. 
 Roger that. I am in route. 
 Thanks, 10-4. 
 [engine turns over] 
 Why were the cops here? 
 Why didn't you come to the train station? 
 Because I couldn't. 
 'Cause of Tommy. 
 Because of you. 
 Where's Chloe? 
 She's not here. 
 I don't understand. 
 What's going on here, Rowan? 
 You told me you were happy. 
 You said I saved you. 
 What did I do? What are you talking about? 
 I told you I was pregnant, and you killed yourself. 
 No, I didn't. 
 You did. 
 I don't... I don't remember that. 
 That's what you did on our wedding day. 
 That's what you did! 
 If I... 
 I'm sorry. 
 That wasn't me, who I am now. 
 No, you made your choice. 
 No. 
 I love you, Rowan. 
 Don't. 
 That's good. 
 You stay right where you are. 
 You told him? 
 She's done talking to you. 
 So here's what I want you to do. 
 I want you to get down on your knees and put your hands on your head. 
 Stop moving. 
 Why? 
 I'm a police officer, and I just gave you an order. 
 You put her up to all this, right? 
 Maybe it's not even true. 
 Maybe he's lying... 
 God damn it. 
 Stop moving. 
 I want you gone. 
 I want you gone! 
 The only thing you know is true, Rowan, is that I love you. 
 Don't. 
 I've always loved you. 
 Stop moving. 
 Don't! 
 [gunshot] 
 [melancholy music]
