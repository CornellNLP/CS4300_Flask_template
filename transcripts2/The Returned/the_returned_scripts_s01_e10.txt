 Previously on The Returned... 
 Go home. 
 You just want me gone so you can have Ben and your friends all to yourself. 
 Camille? 
 [tense music] 
 This town is cursed. 
 Caldwell and everybody in it is just wicked. 
 Somebody needs to do something about it. 
 Maybe building the dam was a mistake. 
 If somebody wanted to destroy it, I bet they would find a way. 
 I held on to you for so long it almost killed me, but I can't anymore. 
 Rowan : This is my life now. I'm marrying Tommy. 
 This is Camille, and she is no different than the day she got on that bus. 
 How can you possibly know that? 
 I know because I'm like her. 
 I died 29 years ago. 
 [ethereal music] 
 I told you to put the fire out. 
 Someone could see the smoke. 
 What'd you get? 
 Some soup and stuff. 
 Just food? That's it? 
 Now would be a great time to try and score something, huh? 
 Cops everywhere, checkpoints still up all over town. 
 Make do. 
 Police still don't have any suspects. 
 I told you. We're golden. 
 Cops don't know sh1t. 
 That's not the point, asshole. 
 Two people are dead because of us. 
 Look, I'm sorry about the kid. 
 His name was Henry. 
 I'm done. 
 What do you mean "done"? 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 You can keep the money. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm gonna hike north, see if I can make it to Canada. 
 Come on, man. 
 We're gonna see the world together like Sal and Dean. 
 This isn't a Kerouac story. 
 We're not characters in a book. 
 We killed people. How do you not get that? 
 It's over. 
 Good-bye, Rich. 
 [gun cocks] 
 You won't make it without me. 
 You'll get caught, rat both of us out. 
 [dramatic music] 
 You've known me my whole life. 
 You're like a brother to me. 
 Come on, just... just put the gun down. 
 [gunshot] 
 [gurgling] 
 Oh, sh1t. Oh, I'm sorry. 
 [poignant music] 
 [sighs] 
 [vehicle approaching] 
 [car doors open, close] 
 You going somewhere? 
 Well, I've been asked to vacate the premises, but that's why you're here, isn't it? 
 To make sure I don't steal the curtains on my way out. 
 Tommy : Actually, that's not why I'm here. 
 It's my wedding day today. 
 Oh, no, am I uninvited? 
 No, you're under arrest. 
 For what? 
 Oh, let's see... 
 Fraud, identity theft, accessory to kidnapping. 
 I promise you this... 
 I will find something that sticks. 
 I don't know who or what you are, but it's wrong. 
 This is my family. It's my town. 
 And I'm gonna keep them safe, whatever it takes. 
 [tense music]

 What's all this? 
 Tommy and Rowan's wedding reception. 
 Apparently Tony rented the place to them months ago. 
 100 people are showing up at 7:00. 
 Never counted on being a wedding planner. 
 What? 
 It started again... the voices. 
 What did you hear? 
 There was a flood? 
 They're trying to warn us. 
 Who? 
 The people who died. 
 [tense music] 
 They said... something bad is gonna happen. 
 Like what? 
 I don't know. 
 They say they've been sending us signs and no one's listening. 
 We have to do something. We have to tell people. 
 What, that you hear dead people, that something bad is gonna happen? 
 How is that gonna work? 
 [scoffs] 
 They'll think I'm crazy. 
 No one will believe me. 
 I do. 
 [door opens] 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Everything all right? 
 It's great. 
 Everything's great. 
 I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm crying. 
 I'm completely messing up my makeup. 
 I woke up with this feeling in the pit of my stomach, like... like something's wrong... like something terrible's gonna happen. 
 [The Greasy Pipes' It's on Now playing on car radio] 
 [inhales deeply] 
 [groans softly] 
 Hey. 
 You live around here? 
 Yeah. 
 You notice anything unusual with the power lately... 
 Blackouts, electrical disturbances, things like that? 
 We did have a blackout and a couple power surges a few weeks back. 
 It was weird... No rain, nothing. 
 Are you from the power company or something? 
 No, I'm just looking for some people. 
 Do you know the Winship family? 
 [tense music] 
 George : I should have listened to you. 
 George? 
 I'm sorry I locked you up in that place. 
 I'm sorry I didn't listen to you. 
 There's something wrong with this town. 
 You've always known it. 
 It'll fight you. 
 It'll try and take you down. 
 But whatever happens, Helen, you can't let it win. 
 Promise me. 
 I promise you. 
 [whimpers] 
 [door opens, creaks] 
 [door closes] 
 Hey. 
 Thanks... Thanks for coming. 
 Who are you? 
 You know who I am, Claire. 
 Tell me now, or I'm walking out the door. 
 My name was Andrew Barlett. 
 How did you die? 
 In the flood. 
 Oh... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I wanted to tell you so many times. 
 Why didn't you? 
 I didn't know how. 
 I thought you wouldn't believe me. 
 [exhales sharply] 
 I just wanted to be the guy you thought I was. 
 So you kept this secret... 
 While Camille was struggling. 
 I thought... 
 I thought she had a better chance of acceptance without me. 
 You hid behind her. 
 You used her. 
 You coward. 
 [knock at door] 
 What are you doing here? 
 We heard you got out of the hospital. 
 Wanted to see how you were. 
 Is she here... 
 Camille? 
 Can we see her? 
 Just go away and leave us alone. 
 Lena, wait, okay? It's not like that. 
 We're your friends. 
 Yeah, we're not gonna judge her or be weird or whatever. 
 Hey. 
 Don't worry. I'm not gonna, like, eat your brains or whatever else Hunter's been saying. 
 [laughs] 
 No one listens to Hunter, anyway. 
 Abby : He's a total dick. 
 We're just on our way to the swimming hole. 
 You guys want to come hang out? 
 Maybe some other time. 
 No, it sounds cool. 
 I'll just go get changed, okay? 
 Camille... 
 Please? 
 I can't stay in here for the rest of my life. 
 Fine. 
 [Nick D' & The Believers' Throwing Stones] 
 It's just up here. 
 [girls giggling] 
 [boys chattering indistinctly] 
 Sara : Hey, guys. 
 What's Hunter doing here? 
 We didn't invite him, I swear. 
 Come on, we're leaving. 
 Hold up. Hold up. 
 I just want to apologize, okay? 
 I shouldn't have blasted you on Facebook. 
 It was a dumb-ass thing to do. 
 I took it all down. 
 I'm sorry too... about the other night... I freaked out. 
 [exhales deeply] I still don't know how this happened. 
 But it's amazing that you're here. 
 We really missed you, Camille. 
 It's okay. I forgive you. 
 She has a broken wrist and a concussion. 
 We're gonna keep her for observation, just to be safe, but she's gonna be fine. 
 Thank you, Alan. 
 Get those stairs fixed. 
 Oh, I will. 
 Let's go. 
 [engine turning over] 
 Who else have you hurt? 
 Answer me. 
 [rock music playing on radio] 
 No. 
 You're gonna listen to me. 
 What you did is bad. 
 Do you understand that? 
 You can't do that to people, not anyone, especially not to someone I love. 
 [rock music playing on radio] 
 Stop it, Victor! 
 Do you think this is funny? 
 Do you think this is a game? 
 It's not. 
 [rock music playing on radio] 
 [indistinct chatter, laughter] 
 [indie folk music] 
 Seems like Camille's having a good time. 
 Yeah. 
 You? 
 I'm fine. 
 [sighs] 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Do you still blame us... for what happened to Camille? 
 It was an accident. 
 Maybe now that she's back, we could, uh... 
 I met someone else. 
 All right, gang. 
 Let's get weird. 
 What is that? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Mushies! 
 What? 
 You mean you've never shroomed? 
 [laughs] Oh, Camille. 
 Tastes like ass. 
 Yep. 
 Tell me you did not just give my sister drugs. 
 Chill. Camille can take care of herself. 
 She's 16. 
 Okay, Mom. 
 You're so embarrassing. 
 Hunter : Seriously, Lena. 
 We were, like, Camille's age when we first got high. 
 Shut up, Hunter. 
 No, he's right. 
 Don't be a hypocrite. 
 I'm having fun. 
 Please don't ruin it. 
 
 
 
 Can I help you? 
 Claire Winship? 
 I'm sorry. Who are you? 
 Kara Pine. 
 I work for TruthVox.com. 
 I do a podcast. 
 You're a reporter? 
 Journalist. 
 I'd like to ask you some questions about your daughter, Camille. 
 My daughter passed four years ago. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 Mrs. Winship, I came across some posts online... 
 Things people are saying about Camille... that she's back. 
 [tense music] 
 I told you, my daughter is dead. 
 I have nothing else to say to you. 
 [melodic cello music playing] 
 Please be seated. 
 Rowan and Tommy, the path that brought you together has been a steep and winding one, but I believe it has been leading you here. 
 To this moment. 
 To each other. 
 To the happiness and love that you both so deserve. 
 You want a ride? 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Do we know each other? 
 I saw you a few days ago at the community center. 
 [sighs] Small town. 
 Oh, I don't believe in coincidences. 
 So where are you headed? 
 As far as you'll take me, I guess. 
 Oh... you don't want to go where I'm going. 
 You should get out of town. 
 [static crackling on radio] 
 [tires screeching] 
 Oh. 
 [air hissing] 
 What the hell was that? 
 It's this town... and whatever's in it. 
 What the...? 
 Y-y-you're not gonna understand, but it's the only way. 
 I wish you hadn't seen that. 
 [dark music] 
 Do you, Rowan Blackshaw, take this man, Tomas Solano, to be your husband... to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish, from this day forward until death do you part? 
 I do. 
 Then by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife. 
 You may kiss the bride. 
 [applause] 
 [cello playing Bach's Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring] 
 Do you remember this place? 
 It was your home, Victor. 
 [car door closes] 
 Something terrible happened to you here, didn't it? 
 Yes. 
 When you came back... your mom was gone. 
 You were all alone. 
 But she told you that the fairy would take care of you. 
 That's all you wanted, wasn't it? 
 Someone to take care of you. 
 But the truth is... your mom's not coming back, and the fairy doesn't exist. 
 The fairy is real. 
 You're the fairy. 
 No... 
 I'm not. 
 I tried to be, but I can't. 
 I love you. 
 And I'm so grateful that we met. 
 But we can't be together anymore. 
 [screams] 
 [gasping] 
 [haunting music] 
 You saved my life in so many ways. 
 But you have to let me go. 
 You don't belong here anymore. 
 Victor? 
 Victor? 
 Victor? 
 Hello? 
 Yoo-hoo. 
 Anybody there?

 I'll always be the freak. 
 No. No, no. Hunter's just a moron, okay? 
 You're amazing. 
 Whoa, hey. 
 I can't. 
 'Cause of Lena? 
 You kissed me first... in the eighth grade, remember? 
 When we were walking home? 
 Why Lena? 
 Why not me? 
 'Cause she was ready to hook up. 
 You weren't. 
 That's all I cared about back then. 
 But after the accident, everything changed. 
 It was like this terrible thing that happened that brought us together. 
 She doesn't love you, you know.

 Thanks. 
 Shane : You got a visitor. 
 I'll give you ten minutes. 
 Thanks, Shane. 
 Peter Lattimore? 
 I'm Kara Pine with TruthVox. 
 I came here looking for Camille Winship. 
 Uh, TruthVox. That's out of Chicago, isn't it? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You flew all the way from Chicago for a girl who died four years ago? 
 Actually, I drove. 
 I've been, um, asking around town about you, and some people told me that I should speak with you, that you and Camille might have something in common. 
 If you came here for a story, I don't have anything to say. 
 You're not the first, you know. 
 What's happening in Caldwell, it's happened before. 
 Gok, Turkey, Lake Anjikuni, Canada, Roanoke Colony, Elmore, Oklahoma. 
 All of them reported seeing people rise from the dead. 
 Want to know what else these places have in common? 
 They all ceased to exist, seemingly overnight, along with everyone who lived there. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Ben. 
 Ben. 
 Ben, stop it. Come on. 
 Ben, stop kidding around. 
 Ben! 
 Ben! 
 Ben! 
 Ben, stop! 
 Ben! 
 Ben! 
 Lena! 
 Lena! 
 Help! 
 [breathing deeply] 
 Okay, George. 
 It's time, just like I promised you.

 [water gurgling] 
 What the hell? 
 Can I help... with the candles or anything? 
 I used to work here. 
 [voices eerily whispering indistinctly] 
 I'm supposed to give you a message. 
 He'll be here soon. 
 When he comes, you need to listen. 
 When who comes? 
 The man whose baby you're carrying. 
 [footsteps thudding rapidly] 
 [explosion] 
 [water rushing] 
 No! 
 No! 
 No! 
 No, no, no.
