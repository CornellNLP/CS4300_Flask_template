 Previously on  The Returned … 
 Camille, who died in an accident several years ago, reappears. I know I’m so late. You must have been worried to death. Don’t stare at me. She and other dead people have come back. I won’t let you near my wife and my daughter again. How? I’ll figure out. Some of them are unaware that they died, and try to resume their lives. Do you know how I feel? I don’t care. You don’t exist! The Helping Hand, led by Pierre, becomes a shelter for the returned. They’re warning us that this world will end. And what’s to come will be wonderful. You’re pregnant. What are you talking about? Leaving the town seems impossible. Didn’t we already get past the dam? The returned have become many. They demand to get their people back. Please do something! I’m going with him. Some of the living will go with them. They want your baby. Stay inside and don’t open to anyone. All right, Captain. Morning comes. The town is flooded. The returned have disappeared. 6 MONTHS LATER Take it easy. Breathe slowly. That’s it. Please lie still. We’re almost there. What the hell? What is it? What have you done? We took the same road as usual. Doesn’t seem like it. THE CHILD Mommy? How are you, Adèle? What happened? You don’t remember anything? You’re at the emergency department of the town’s hospital. You fell down the stairs at your home. And you passed out. The emergency workers wanted to move you to another hospital, across the valley, but apparently, the ambulance had a problem, and they preferred to bring you here. The hospital is closed, but the emergency department is functioning normally. It’s OK. Don’t worry. The baby is fine. He isn’t hurt. Good morning. Good morning. A few minutes, please. We’ll take you there. You are Berg? You were supposed to arrive this afternoon. Yes, but there was no traffic. Did you have lunch? Not yet. Hamburger or hot dog. There aren’t many choices. I recommend the hot dog. We don’t have any more hot dogs. I’m not hungry. I’ll have a coffee. Thank you. It’s not great. But it’s the only restaurant that’s still open in town. Most of the inhabitants have left. If you’re tired, we can show you your quarters right now. It’s not far from here. I’m fine. Thanks. You’ll see. Those who stayed here are a little… weird. But, oh well. Considering what happened to them. The flood. Yes. I heard you insisted to come here. That’s right. You like backwaters? I’m from here. All right. The water rose almost up to the third floor here. Were you here when it happened? No, we were caught off-guard. The water rose quickly. Your predecessor couldn’t explain why it rose this fast. You have any leads? It’s too soon to talk about it. Have we found all the victims? We’re still looking for corpses, including the police officers. We had to evacuate the people living in this domain by helicopter, the day after the flood. The water hasn’t lowered since. We’re regularly checking the level. Hello, Lieutenant. Berg, from the investigation office. He’s replacing Fongarnan. I hope you’ll be more effective. The Captain and his men will help you in your researches. So? No evolution. It’s stable. Is it the only place in the valley where the water remains? No, the far south of town is flooded too. We’ll go on the heights. You’ll better understand the situation. You see the buildings? It’s the limit of the southern part of town. Here. Thanks. Over there, the old police station. We only see the roof now. The surroundings had to be evacuated. To the right is the hydroelectric plant. In the distance, it’s the dam. According to the previous experts, there is no leak. But there’s a connection. Isn’t there? Have you heard about the Helping Hand? Is that where the police officers vanished? Yes. So, do you know more about it? Not really. Hasn’t those who took shelter there told you anything? They said a bunch of looters attacked them during the night, and when they came out in the morning, there wasn’t anyone left. No police officers or anything. And who were those looters? They told us they didn’t know. But I think they haven’t told us everything. Lieutenant? Yes. We need you, right now. Frédéric, can you show them where they can stay? Sure. Welcome. Was it dead when you found it? Yes, Lieutenant. Apparently, another animal attacked it. What are they doing? I don’t know. Another dead animal? Have you finished the exercise? Anouk’s parents are here. Hi, Adèle. Hi. Anouk said you had an accident last week. I just fell. Everything’s fine, now. Maybe you should rest. I’m fine. Thanks. We’re leaving town. All right. Thank you for everything you did for Anouk and the other children. Lola’s parents are moving too. There won’t be anyone left in town, soon. I’m sorry to tell you this, but you should leave too. I know it’s complicated for you, but— We could accommodate you and Chloé. As long as necessary. Thank you. But we’re not leaving. If you change your mind— I won’t. All right. Goodbye, then. Goodbye. Tell the Commander that Berg is here. Yes, Lieutenant. Alcide, your girlfriend’s here. Hi, Léna. Who’s that? A new expert. Have you found something? No. He’s here for the dam. I’m sorry. You don’t have to come here every day. I’ll tell you if something comes up. I don’t mind. I don’t have much to do. Is your father OK? Is the work progressing? I guess. Well, see you. Do you want me to take you back? I’m good. Thanks. Are you OK? Yes. I’m taking a rest. What? What happened the other night? What are you talking about? When you fell down the stairs. I went down to have a drink and I felt dizzy. Dizzy? Yes. I lost my balance and I fell. I saw you. What did you see? You fell on purpose. That’s not true. I felt dizzy. And I fell. Are you OK? Yes. Is it the baby? Is he moving? Stop it. Leave me alone. Go away. Dad? Tristan, Pauline, we are happy to welcome the gift of your faith and your trust. And to give you ours in return. You can count on us. The Helping Hand is open to you, as are our hearts. You can forsake your fears. I’ll show you the road. I’ll follow you. I have to see my brother. Lie down, sir. Let go of me! Calm down. Let go of me! Sir, please calm down. I’m giving him a shot. Let go of me! Call Father Jean-François. Call Father Jean-François. Hurry up. Yes, Alcide. How long will we be freezing here? Excuse me. Can you help me? What are you doing here? I don’t know. I was in the bus. I don’t understand what happened. Where do you live? Jean-Jacques Rousseau Street. Number 18. My name’s Audrey Sabatini. That’s the flooded area. Where are your parents? At home. That’s not possible. They must have been evacuated. Evacuated where? Come with us. We’ll take care of you. I just want to go home. Don’t worry. Don’t worry. Come. 
 
 Your father’s not here? I couldn’t reach him. Where’s Toni? In the emergency department. Are you sure it’s him? Yes. I want to see him. You can’t, right now. They won’t let anyone near him. Do they know what happened to him? He got hit by a car. He has a head wound, but nothing serious. But do they know he’s dead? They think he was just missing, since we didn’t find his body. We have to tell them. They’ll have to believe us. I don’t think that’s a good idea. I didn’t ask you. No one else knows what happened to him. No one knows he’s dead. If we all tell them, they’ll believe us. No, they won’t. Telling what happened to Toni would put him in danger. Léna, your father. Where were you? What’s happening? Toni is back. Mr. Séguret, we’ll ask you a few questions. Why me? Come with me. It’s Mr. Séguret. Please follow me. Have a seat, Mr. Séguret. Do you know Toni Garrel? You’ve found him? Yes. Where? On the road near the dam. Did he talk? No… Yes. What did he say? Not much. He is traumatized. He doesn’t remember anything. Can I talk to him? That’s not possible, sorry. When the flood happened, when you were questioned about your wife’s disappearance, you said he was dead? Yes. Why did you think he was dead? Because he was. Did your wife know him? Yes. Why are you asking me that? Might she have followed him, or might he have kidnapped her? No. He wouldn’t have done that. Why did you say he was dead? I thought he was. Am I the only one? No. But you said your daughter Camille disappeared with your wife. I don’t see the connection. The connection? You lied about Camille, and you’re lying about Toni. I didn’t lie. Mr. Séguret, your daughter, Camille Séguret, couldn’t have disappeared at the same time as your wife. She is dead. We’re doing everything we can to find your wife. Help us. Tell us the truth. I’ve been telling you the truth for months. Where are you taking me? The people who were living in the flooded area have been rehoused at the other side. Your parents would be there. What happened? Why can’t I remember anything? That kind of trauma leaves marks. Watch out! What the hell? Where are you going? I don’t understand. What’s this sh1t? I always take this path. I don’t understand. Miss? Miss? Have the contractions started suddenly? It wasn’t contractions. It was hits. It doesn’t seem to have any link with your fall. Is it normal? Yes. Were you told something during previous scans? No. You’re at 24 weeks of amenorrhoea? Yes. Why? It’s above the 100th percentile. That is to say? It’s very big. It has the size of an 8-month-old fetus. I can’t find the name of your doctor. You come with me? See you later. So? She had violent contractions. The child’s heart rate has gone up, and so has hers. She didn’t have any consultations. Did you know? No. It’s too late to move her. We’ll perform an anticipated delivery, tonight. Audrey? Come with me. Are you OK, Chloé? It’s your mom? She’s about to give birth. Everything’s gonna be fine. Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat? I’ll be right back. Excuse me. Good evening. You brought Toni to the emergency department? Yes. Were was he when you ran into him? On a road, near the dam. Did he tell you something? No. Was he alone? Yes. What do you want to know? I’m just worried about him. Was he at the Helping Hand when the flood happened? Yes. What happened to him? I don’t know. I wanted to call you, but— You didn’t have the courage. When did you come back? Two months ago. You’re staying at the Helping Hand? So is he? What do you do there? We help the newcomers. The newcomers? Those who have decided to join us. They believe us. Damn it. You could come live with us. Yeah, right. I’d rather die. We’ll be safe, there. Dad? What did they tell you? Nothing. Could you talk to Toni? What did they ask? Nothing! They know nothing. They won’t let me talk to him. We should leave. You wanna leave? Stay, if you want. You’re leaving me by myself? I’m sick of being alone! What are you doing? Why don’t you answer the phone? Are you drinking again? No. Come on, Léna. Go away. Léna? Go away! Léna. Are you OK, Adèle? Take me home. Please. Don’t worry. They’ll take good care of you, here. At least, you’re safe. I’m sure this delivery will go just fine. I don’t want a delivery. I don’t want it to get out. I understand that you’re worried, but you’ve been so brave for months. The fact that you wanted to keep this child— I didn’t want to keep this child. Sorry? I tried to abort, several times. But it didn’t work. What do you mean? The father is not Thomas. Who is it? Where are we? We’re almost there. Mrs. Séguret? Audrey? Camille! What a nightmare! Where are we? We’re in a safe place. Don’t worry. There was a flood? That’s it. I need to tell my parents. We’ll tell them. What happened to the bus? Is it because of the flood? No. There was an accident. It’s OK. We’ll take care of you. Don’t worry. You must be hungry. Are you? Yes. Good. Come with me, Camille. We’ll make something. We shouldn’t tell her. She’ll eventually find out. Keep your voice down. If we tell her, she’ll think we’re crazy. She already think we’re crazy. She needs to rest. We’ll tell her tomorrow. Tell me what? Something happened to my parents? No, they’re fine. I need to go home. Help! You shouldn’t go out. Audrey! Help! Help! Or they’ll come for us. Who? Them. Don’t worry. It will be all right. They’ll take good care of your mom. What about the baby? The baby will be fine. I’m sure. Will he be like us or like them? Hail Mary, full of grace. Our Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. She’s at 110. Get the operating room ready. You want me to take you? Who are the people downstairs? They’ve just come back. It happened again. Adèle is at the hospital. It’s happening tonight? You see. We’ll all be reunited soon. I told you. Are you sure? I’ll need you’re help. You can count on me. Everything’s almost over. Kiss me. Yes? I thought you were still sleeping. Are you hungry? Not really. Thanks. Do you want to play? Yes. What game? I don’t know. Whatever you like. Do you recognize her? It’s Laure. Do you miss her? Will you always stay with me? Of course. No matter what happens? I’ll never leave you alone. But will you stay with me forever? I promise. There’s someone downstairs. Hi. Who are you? My name’s Julie. My baby boy! Count down from 10. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4…
