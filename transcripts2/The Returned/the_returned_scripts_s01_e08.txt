 male announcer : Previously on The Returned... 
 I don't understand. What's going on here? 
 You stay right where you are. 
 You told him? 
 Chloe and I... We don't need you anymore. 
 Stop moving. 
 I've always loved you... 
 Don't. 
 And I will always love... 
 Thank God you're here. 
 I found this necklace. It was Lucy's. 
 What are you doing? Tony, let me go. 
 Stop talking, stop talking. 
 I won't tell anyone, I swear! 
 [screams] 
 Shut up! 
 She knows about you. 
 Just let me handle it. 
 Forgive Tony. He didn't know what he was doing. 
 Please don't tell anyone about me. 
 You've been locked in this house for four years lighting candles to your dead daughter's shrine. 
 You're pissed off 'cause you've got no one left to mourn. 
 Camille's back, Lena doesn't need you anymore, and you don't know what the hell to do. 
 Jack's right. Maybe it's time I started seeing what's right in front of me. 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 That's great. 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [laughs] Very sexy. 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 [both laughing] 
 That's what I was going for. 
 Very mysterious. 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 Peter, what are you doing? 
 I'm cutting to the chase. 
 Come on, admit it... 
 This whole professional photographer thing is just an elaborate ploy to get me naked. 
 Very funny. 
 Funny but true. 
 [laughs] 
 How cold do you think the water is? 
 Cold. 
 I guess we'll find out. 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 [laughs] You're a lunatic! 
 Whoo! 
 [laughs] 
 It's actually quite warm. 
 Come on in. 
 You know you want to. [chuckles] 
 [laughs, claps hands] 
 Whoo! [claps hands] 
 Here I come. 
 That's my girl. 
 Whoo! 
 Aah! 
 [laughs] 
 [screaming] 
 It's freezing! 
 What? 
 You liar! 
 It's beautiful. 
 You liar! Liar! Liar! 
 It's beautiful. 
 [laughs] 
 You're really talented. 
 [chuckles] 
 I'm serious. Why aren't you off... shooting the cover of National Geographic or something? 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah, that was the plan. 
 Yeah? 
 I was at the University of Auckland, working on my masters. 
 I had this whole idea of what my life was going to look like. 
 Hmm. 
 Then I met Jack. 
 Next thing I knew, I was dropping out, following him across the world. 
 Plans change, huh? 
 Sometimes, I imagine there's... this other version of me out there. 
 [chuckles] Yeah? 
 [chuckles] 
 Taking pictures, learning languages... 
 [laughs] 
 Eating spicy, exotic food. 
 [laughs] 
 It's never too late to change directions in our life. 
 You don't have kids. 
 They change everything. 
 All your dreams... become dreams for them. 
 Camille and Lena are the best things that have ever happened to me. 
 I just sometimes need to be reminded... 
 I'm here too. 
 Yes, you are. 
 [emergency brake cranks] 
 Jack : Hey. 
 Claire : Hey. 
 You're home late. 
 Yeah. I was at the Triple C, putting together a grant proposal for the new arts program. 
 That sounds great. 
 We're watching Twilight. 
 I'm pulling for team Edward. He's just so sparkly. 
 both : Shh! 
 Sorry. 
 [smooches] 
 [dog barking in the distance] 
 Where were you? 
 I'm sorry. 
 [both sobbing] 
 [sighs] 
 [sighs] 
 [indistinct chatter over police radio] 
 [ambulance doors close] 
 He said he was gonna take me with him. 
 Are you sure this is the same man you saw outside the house? 
 And at the library. 
 He was pretending to be my former fiancé, Simon Moran, but Simon died six years ago. 
 You didn't know this man? 
 I told him to leave, that I wasn't going anywhere with him. 
 And what did he do? 
 He put a knife to my throat. 
 If Tommy hadn't come home, I don't know what would've happened. 
 man : Nikki, here's the file you requested from archives, double murder on Beck Avenue, 1986. 
 Thanks, Ryan. 
 [sighs] 
 [whispering] Nikki, it's the middle of the night. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I need to talk to you... 
 In private. 
 Okay. 
 Victor's real name is Henry Garrity. 
 Do you remember that abandoned house on Beck Avenue? 
 He and his mother were murdered there... almost 30 years ago. 
 That homeless woman was right. 
 I don't want to know. 
 Julie... 
 Whoever he was, whatever terrible thing happened to him, it's in the past. 
 You don't understand. 
 No, you don't understand. 
 I don't know how or why, but Victor was sent to me for a reason. 
 I'm supposed to take care of him. 
 We're supposed to take care of each other. 
 I wish I could explain, but I can't. 
 You're not the first. 
 Four years ago, this lady... 
 She was single, around your age. 
 She filed a report about a lost little boy. 
 She found him outside her house just like you did. 
 There was nobody looking for him. 
 The kid didn't speak. 
 So what? 
 The woman's name was Lauren Navarro. 
 Do you remember the bus crash? 
 She was a teacher on that bus. She's dead. 
 Julie : What does this have to do with Victor? 
 Nikki : They thought that an animal ran into the road, made the bus swerve, but they never found any trace of it. 
 What if it wasn't an animal? 
 Zach. Zach, please, don't make this any harder. 
 Come on, I need you to get out. Come on. 
 Now, listen to me. I don't know... why it is that you're here, but this is wrong. 
 You don't belong here. 
 You need to go back, wherever it is that you came from. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 [car door closes] 
 [engine turning over] 
 Camille. 
 Camille! 
 Camille : Let me off. 
 Let me off! Let me out! 
 Camille, it's not safe. 
 Go back to your seat! 
 I have to get off, please! 
 That is enough! 
 [tires screeching] 
 Trust me, him being back is not right. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Because that kid freaks me out, and I'm scared for you. 
 He's just a little boy. 
 Who knows what he's capable of? 
 It's late. 
 You should go. 
 [sighs] 
 Julie, please, listen to me. 
 [sighs] 
 I know you're awake. 
 I know someone hurt you. 
 Someone hurt me too. 
 So I understand. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I recognized the necklace right away. 
 Lucy wore it all the time, and... 
 It had this thumbprint on it, and I thought it was cool, and then I asked her about it once. 
 She didn't say whose it was. 
 So Tony Darrow came back? He saw you with Lucy's necklace? 
 Yeah. 
 And he went crazy. 
 He tied me up and locked me in this creepy shed. 
 I thought he was gonna kill me. 
 And I let him run the Dog Star, that son of a bitch. 
 Jack, calm down. 
 Honey, you didn't tell us how you ended up at Tony Darrow's cabin in the first place? 
 I don't remember. 
 I was out of it from the pain meds and... 
 Maybe Tony found me outside the Dog Star and brought me there. 
 Okay. 
 I think the best thing to do is go down to the station, let the police handle this. 
 No, Mom, I don't want to. I-I don't know anything else. 
 Where are you going? 
 Take a guess. 
 Jack! 
 Call the police. 
 Jack, stop. Hey, slow down. 
 Jack, hold on a second. 
 Don't you touch me. 
 Look, I get it. I do. 
 You have every right to be angry. 
 But whatever you're about to do... 
 It isn't worth it. 
 That's not your daughter in there. 
 That's not your family. 
 [car door opens] 
 [engine turning over] 
 [tires squealing] 
 [engine turning over] 
 [tires squealing] 
 Someone's coming. 
 No, 'cause she promised she wouldn't tell anyone. 
 Tony : She lied. 
 You got to go. 
 No, Tony. 
 Yes, look, I will make this right. 
 I will take care of it. I will make this right. 
 But you got to go right now. 
 Go. 
 Go! 
 Jack. 
 What'd you do to my daughter, huh? 
 What? 
 What'd you do to my daughter? 
 Huh? 
 What'd you do to my daughter? 
 What'd you do to my daughter? 
 Sorry, I didn't want to hurt Lena. 
 Jack, that's enough. You need to stop now. 
 Aah! 
 [Jack groans] 
 I'm not gonna let you kill him. 
 [groaning] 
 [siren wailing in the distance] 
 Does it still hurt? 
 No, it's just a little sensitive. 
 What do you think it was? 
 I don't know. 
 It sounds crazy, but... 
 I-I think maybe it was because I was blaming myself... for not being on the bus with you that day and for what I did with Ben. 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 It wasn't yours either. 
 Why do you think it's going away now? 
 Maybe because I realized you're really back. 
 It's not too late to be different. 
 When you were gone... 
 I got what it must've been like for you. 
 I don't ever want to feel that way again. 
 Me either. 
 [engine stops] 
 [car beeping] 
 [car door closes] 
 [dog barking in distance] 
 Rowan? 
 Baby? 
 Rowan! 
 Hey, love. 
 Sorry. I didn't hear you come in. 
 Why aren't you at work? 
 I came by to check on you and give you these. 
 Thank you, That's so sweet. 
 But I'm okay, really. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I just... 
 I've never shot anyone before. 
 Simon chose to die... years ago. 
 He would have never left us alone. 
 You did the right thing. 
 Listen to this. 
 [Cat Stevens' Wild World] 
 ♪ I'll always remember you ♪ 
 You recognize it? 
 Of course. 
 ♪ You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do ♪ 
 Our first date. 
 [laughs] 
 You really want to call it a date? 
 We got, like, three blocks from the house, listening to this song on the radio, and my water broke all over your car. 
 [both laugh] 
 And you had to rush me to the hospital and... 
 [both laugh] 
 That was the best date of my life. 
 Oh, the best date of your life was watching me give birth? 
 Now, that's just sad. 
 That's not sad. 
 Watching you bring this amazing... little person... into the world, that... that was awesome. 
 ♪ I'll always remember you like a child, girl ♪ 
 So what do you think? 
 About what? 
 This song... for our first dance.

 Nikki : You want to tell us how... Lucy McCabe's necklace ended up in your cabin? 
 I took it... all of it, from the girls. 
 What girls, Tony? 
 Lucy. 
 I don't know the names of the others. 
 Meredith Williams, Carmen Santos, Jen Rodriguez, Julie Han. 
 What are you saying, Tony? 
 It was me. 
 I stabbed them, and I bit them, and it was me... and I want to confess. 
 You sat here before... and you swore to us that you never hurt these women. 
 [swallows hard] 
 I lied. 
 And I want to make it right. 
 [door closes] 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 Hey, Nikki. 
 [sighs] We got him. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 We need you to come down to the station. 
 You know when I told you someone hurt me a long time ago? 
 Well, the police caught the bad guy, and they need my help. 
 You can come with me, but if anyone talks to you or asks you any questions, you need to say you're my nephew. 
 Got it? 
 Are they charging Jack? 
 Uh, no. No, I don't think so. 
 Tony Darrow confessed. 
 The last thing anyone cares about is what Jack did. 
 What did he do? 
 He beat the living sh1t out of him. 
 If I hadn't have broken it up, he would've literally killed him. 
 Thank you for going after him. 
 Looks like they're wrapping it up. 
 Be back soon. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 Lena's gonna have to come in and make a statement tomorrow, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Well, what's next with Tony? 
 Well, he confessed to everything, so next, we just try to corroborate some of the stuff he said. 
 [sighs] 
 Don't worry. 
 He's not going anywhere except prison, okay? 
 Go home. 
 Try to keep this guy out of trouble, all right? 
 I'll do my best. 
 Was that Dad? 
 Peter. He and Dad are on their way back. 
 How's Lena? 
 Sleeping. 
 Are those from our tree? 
 I picked them for the Koretskys. 
 Oliver used to like them, so... 
 Very thoughtful. 
 They were really kind to you last night, weren't they? 
 Do you think you could give me a ride over to their house? 
 Right now? 
 Honey, there's a lot going on today. 
 I keep thinking about them. 
 You got me back. 
 The Koretskys don't have anyone. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Cars are both here. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Paul? 
 Rachel? 
 Hello? 
 [gasps] 
 Oh. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [Camille sobbing] 
 Claire : Oh. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks for coming down. I know this isn't easy. 
 You okay? 
 Loretta, this is Victor. 
 Do you mind keeping an eye on him? 
 Hey, Victor. How you doing? 
 I'm Julie's nephew. 
 Well, lucky Julie. 
 You know, I've lost a bag of cookies somewhere in my desk. 
 Will you help me find them? 
 I think I put them on that side. 
 No, I mean, none of this is mine. 
 Are you sure? 
 You didn't lose any jewelry the night you were attacked? 
 No. 
 Is that it? 
 Look, I understand you haven't been able to remember the face of your assailant. 
 We showed you a picture of Tony Darrow seven years ago. 
 Maybe if you took another look at him in person, it might jog your memory. 
 [sighs] 
 [Julie breathing heavily] 
 Jules? 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Jules, sit down. Sit down, it's okay. 
 Look at me, it's gonna be okay. 
 Just breathe. 
 [sighs] 
 In for two, out for two. Ready? 
 [breathes heavily] 
 Look at me. 
 [breathes heavily] 
 Hey, look at me. You're gonna be okay. 
 [breathing steadily] 
 [door creaks] 
 Hmm. 
 Tony? 
 Tony! 
 Peter : Did you call the police? 
 I couldn't call the police. I had Camille with me. 
 The sheriff's already looking for her. 
 I didn't know what to do, so we just left. 
 Camille saw them? 
 She's upstairs with Lena. She's devastated, Jack. 
 It's okay. Hey, nobody saw you. 
 I'll... I'll go over to the Koretskys myself. 
 I'll say we were supposed to meet tonight, and I found 'em like that. 
 No one will know Camille had anything to do with it. 
 Except her. 
 We don't know what... 
 Camille told them that their son was waiting for them in Heaven because you told her to. 
 This is because of your brilliant idea. 
 Jack, one statement does not drive people to suicide, okay? 
 No one could have known how fragile the Koretskys were. 
 We should have known. 
 After the accident, I would've done anything to see my daughter's face again. 
 You wouldn't have killed yourself. 
 Jack's right. 
 We never should have put Camille in that position. 
 You mean giving her the chance to help people? 
 To find some kind of meaning in all this? 
 I mean telling her to lie. 
 I didn't tell her... 
 Claire, I didn't tell her to lie. 
 Bullshit. 
 At least take some responsibility. 
 Oh, really? Responsibility? [laughs] 
 Yeah, Jack, you're the paradigm of responsibility. 
 When your family was falling apart, where were you? 
 At a bar with a bunch of kids, banging some 25-year-old hooker. 
 Peter, stop! 
 Don't tell... 
 You can't talk to him like that. 
 Claire : You need to go... now. 
 It's about time she sees what you really are. 
 Yeah, what am I really, Jack? 
 A manipulative pariah who preyed on a grieving, married woman just to get laid. 
 Not only do you have no idea who I really am, you have no idea who your wife is either. 
 We were sleeping together a year before the accident. 
 Yeah. 
 Claire didn't fall into my bed out of grief. 
 She ran there out of boredom. 
 Wow. 
 That's desperate, man, even for you. 
 What did you think she was doing all those afternoons at the Triple C... Volunteering? 
 [engine turning over, car beeping] 
 The Koretskys were always weird. 
 They kept Oliver's baby teeth in a jar on their mantel. 
 And they wore T-shirts with his face on it to our high-school graduation. 
 Who does that? 
 I'm sorry about what happened to them, but it had nothing to do with you. 
 How do you know that? 
 You can't make people kill themselves. 
 But what if I can? 
 I never sleep anymore. 
 I have this, like... hunger inside of me. 
 It never stops. 
 What if I'm turning into something bad? 
 You're not. 
 You're my sister. That's who you are. 
 Oh, you're a hungry little fella, aren't you? 
 Can I help you? 
 I, um... 
 I-I need to talk to a cop. 
 About what, sir? 
 Just... I need to tell them something about some things I know, about some... about some crimes. 
 All right, well, you go and sit down, and as soon as one of our police officers is available... 
 No, no, I don't... I need to talk to a cop right now. 
 Loretta : This is a police station, not McDonald's. 
 You're gonna have to wait. 
 Ma? 
 You can't keep a secret like this. 
 You're too stupid. 
 Ma. 
 You know what you have to do. 
 I'll call you later, okay? 
 Okay. 
 The best I can do for you is to get you started on an incident report... 
 I don't want to fill out an in... 
 That you will have to fill out... 
 Where's Victor? 
 He was right here just a second ago. 
 No, he was right here. 
 He was right here. 
 Ma. 
 Make it right. 
 Ma. [sobs] 
 [sobbing] 
 [sobbing] Ma. 
 [distant thudding] 
 Tony : No, no! 
 Ma. 
 [thud] 
 Ma. 
 Ma! 
 Tony! Stop! 
 Stop, Tony! 
 Stop! 
 Tony : Ah! No! 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 Put the gun down, Tony! 
 Hey, hey! 
 No, no, no. 
 Don't do it. 
 Put it down, Tony. 
 Tony, drop it! 
 No, no, no. 
 Don't be stupid, Tony. 
 Tommy : Don't do it. 
 Do it, son. Make it right. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 both : No! 
 [gunshot] 
 Shane : I forgot to disarm. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 sh1t. 
 Hey, bug. 
 I missed you. How was your sleepover? 
 Grandma snores. 
 [laughs] 
 Did the angel come? 
 The angel had to go back to Heaven. 
 When's he coming back? 
 He's not. 
 Because of me? 
 No, no, no, no... because he didn't belong here. 
 But he's my daddy. 
 Well, sort of. 
 But a daddy is someone who takes care of you, who's been there your whole life, like Tommy. 
 Tommy's not going anywhere, ever. 
 But he's not my real daddy. I want my real daddy! 
 Chloe... 
 I want the angel now! I want my daddy! 
 I want my daddy! 
 It's okay. It's okay. Come here. 
 [sighs] 
 [thud] 
 [thud] 
 [loud banging]
